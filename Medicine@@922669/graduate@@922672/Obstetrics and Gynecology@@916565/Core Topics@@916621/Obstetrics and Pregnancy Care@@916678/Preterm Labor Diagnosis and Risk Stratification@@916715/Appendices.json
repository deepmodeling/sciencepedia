Given as $P(D) = 0.25$.\n- The probability of not delivering is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n- The sensitivity ($S_e$) is the probability of a positive test given the presence of the condition: $S_e = P(T^+ | D) = 0.85$.\n- The specificity ($S_p$) is the probability of a negative test given the absence of the condition: $S_p = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.75$.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can also determine the probabilities of incorrect test results:\n- The false negative rate is $P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - S_e = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n- The false positive rate is $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - S_p = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$.\n\n**Derivation of Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\n\nThe PPV is the probability that a patient with a positive test result will actually deliver within $7$ days. This is the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nBy the definition of conditional probability:\n$$ P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T^+)$, is the joint probability of having the condition and testing positive. It can be expressed using the definition of conditional probability as $P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D)$.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test. We find this using the Law of Total Probability, summing over the two mutually exclusive scenarios in which a positive test can occur (a true positive and a false positive):\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c) $$\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the numerator and denominator back into the PPV equation yields:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)} $$\nIn terms of sensitivity ($S_e$), specificity ($S_p$), and prevalence ($p=P(D)$):\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{S_e \\cdot p}{S_e \\cdot p + (1 - S_p) \\cdot (1 - p)} $$\n\n**Derivation of Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\n\nThe NPV is the probability that a patient with a negative test result will not deliver within $7$ days. This is the conditional probability $P(D^c | T^-)$.\n\nBy the definition of conditional probability:\n$$ P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(D^c \\cap T^-)}{P(T^-)} $$\nThe numerator, $P(D^c \\cap T^-)$, is the joint probability of not having the condition and testing negative. It can be expressed as $P(D^c \\cap T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)$.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the overall probability of a negative test. We again use the Law of Total Probability, summing over a true negative and a false negative:\n$$ P(T^-) = P(T^- \\cap D^c) + P(T^- \\cap D) $$\n$$ P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the numerator and denominator back into the NPV equation yields:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)} $$\nIn terms of sensitivity ($S_e$), specificity ($S_p$), and prevalence ($p=P(D)$):\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{S_p \\cdot (1 - p)}{S_p \\cdot (1 - p) + (1 - S_e) \\cdot p} $$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now substitute the given values: $p = 0.25$, $S_e = 0.85$, and $S_p = 0.75$.\n\nFor PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.85) \\cdot (0.25)}{(0.85) \\cdot (0.25) + (1 - 0.75) \\cdot (1 - 0.25)} = \\frac{0.2125}{0.2125 + (0.25) \\cdot (0.75)} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.2125}{0.2125 + 0.1875} = \\frac{0.2125}{0.4} = 0.53125 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\text{PPV} \\approx 0.5313$.\n\nFor NPV:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{(0.75) \\cdot (1 - 0.25)}{(0.75) \\cdot (1 - 0.25) + (1 - 0.85) \\cdot (0.25)} = \\frac{(0.75) \\cdot (0.75)}{(0.75) \\cdot (0.75) + (0.15) \\cdot (0.25)} $$\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{0.5625}{0.5625 + 0.0375} = \\frac{0.5625}{0.6} = 0.9375 $$\nThis value is already at four significant figures.\n\n**Clinical Interpretation**\n\n- **Positive Predictive Value (PPV) $\\approx 0.5313$**: A positive test result increases the patient's risk of delivering within $7$ days from the pretest probability of $25\\%$ to a post-test probability of approximately $53\\%$. This more than doubles the risk. This substantial increase justifies significant clinical interventions. Actions would likely include hospital admission for surveillance, administration of a full course of antenatal corticosteroids to enhance fetal lung maturity, and administration of magnesium sulfate for fetal neuroprotection, given the gestational age is less than $32$ weeks. A transfer to a facility with a higher level of neonatal care may also be initiated. It is critical to note, however, that the test is not definitive; approximately $47\\%$ of patients with a positive test will not deliver in the next $7$ days, highlighting the risk of iatrogenic consequences from over-intervention.\n\n- **Negative Predictive Value (NPV) $= 0.9375$**: A negative test result is highly reassuring. The post-test probability of delivery within $7$ days is very low, calculated as $1 - \\text{NPV} = 1 - 0.9375 = 0.0625$, or $6.25\\%$. Given this low residual risk, a negative result strongly supports a decision to rule out imminent preterm birth. This allows for the confident discharge of the patient from the hospital, avoidance of unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions (such as corticosteroids and prolonged hospitalization), and a return to routine prenatal care with tocolysis being likely withheld. The high NPV is the principal clinical utility of this biomarker, as it effectively identifies a large group of symptomatic women who are at low risk and do not require aggressive management.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.5313  0.9375 \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "4499274"}, {"introduction": "While predictive values are intuitive, they are population-dependent and change with the pre-test probability.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biostatistics and their application to medical diagnostics, specifically in the field of obstetrics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data (sensitivities and specificities) and a critical assumption (conditional independence) required to derive a unique, meaningful solution. The language is objective and precise.\n\nLet $D^+$ denote the event of delivery within $7$ days (the \"disease\" or outcome is present), and $D^-$ denote the event of not delivering within $7$ days (outcome is absent).\nLet $T_1$ represent the fetal fibronectin (fFN) test, and $T_2$ represent the transvaginal cervical length (CL) test. A positive result for each test is denoted by $T_1^+$ and $T_2^+$, respectively.\n\nThe problem provides the following operating characteristics for the two tests:\nFor the fFN test ($T_1$):\nSensitivity, $S_{e,1} = P(T_1^+ | D^+) = 0.50$\nSpecificity, $S_{p,1} = P(T_1^- | D^-) = 0.85$\n\nFor the CL test ($T_2$):\nSensitivity, $S_{e,2} = P(T_2^+ | D^+) = 0.40$\nSpecificity, $S_{p,2} = P(T_2^- | D^-) = 0.95$\n\nThe positive likelihood ratio ($LR^+$) for a single diagnostic test is defined as the ratio of the probability of a positive test result given the presence of the condition to the probability of a positive test result given the absence of the condition. It is calculated from sensitivity ($S_e$) and specificity ($S_p$) as:\n$$LR^+ = \\frac{P(\\text{Test}^+ | D^+)}{P(\\text{Test}^+ | D^-)} = \\frac{S_e}{1 - S_p}$$\nThe term $1-S_p$ is the false positive rate, $P(\\text{Test}^+ | D^-)$.\n\nUsing this definition, we can calculate the individual positive likelihood ratios for each test.\nFor the fFN test ($T_1$):\n$$LR^+_1 = \\frac{S_{e,1}}{1 - S_{p,1}} = \\frac{0.50}{1 - 0.85} = \\frac{0.50}{0.15}$$\n\nFor the CL test ($T_2$):\n$$LR^+_2 = \\frac{S_{e,2}}{1 - S_{p,2}} = \\frac{0.40}{1 - 0.95} = \\frac{0.40}{0.05}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the joint positive likelihood ratio, $LR^+_{\\text{joint}}$, for the case where both tests are positive. This is defined as:\n$$LR^+_{\\text{joint}} = \\frac{P(T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+ | D^+)}{P(T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+ | D^-)}$$\n\nTo proceed, we invoke the principle of conditional independence, which is explicitly stated as an assumption in the problem. Conditional independence means that the results of the two tests are statistically independent, given the patient's true outcome status (i.e., will deliver or will not deliver within $7$ days).\n\nMathematically, this assumption implies:\n1. For patients who will deliver ($D^+$): $P(T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+ | D^+) = P(T_1^+ | D^+) \\times P(T_2^+ | D^+) = S_{e,1} \\times S_{e,2}$\n2. For patients who will not deliver ($D^-$): $P(T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+ | D^-) = P(T_1^+ | D^-) \\times P(T_2^+ | D^-) = (1 - S_{p,1}) \\times (1 - S_{p,2})$\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the formula for the joint likelihood ratio:\n$$LR^+_{\\text{joint}} = \\frac{S_{e,1} \\times S_{e,2}}{(1 - S_{p,1}) \\times (1 - S_{p,2})} = \\left(\\frac{S_{e,1}}{1 - S_{p,1}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{S_{e,2}}{1 - S_{p,2}}\\right)$$\nThis demonstrates that under the assumption of conditional independence, the joint likelihood ratio is simply the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$LR^+_{\\text{joint}} = LR^+_1 \\times LR^+_2$$\n\nThe multiplicative combination of individual likelihood ratios is therefore valid only when the tests are conditionally independent. This assumption would be invalidated if there is a statistical dependence between the tests that is not accounted for by their mutual association with the outcome. For instance, in preterm labor, both the release of fetal fibronectin into the cervicovaginal fluid (leading to a positive fFN) and the shortening of the cervix (leading to a positive CL test) may be driven by a common underlying pathophysiological process, such as subclinical inflammation or premature uterine activation. If such a common cause exists, a patient with the condition ($D^+$) who has one positive test would be more likely to have the other positive test than would be predicted by the sensitivity alone. In this scenario, $P(T_1^+ \\cap T_2^+ | D^+) > P(T_1^+ | D^+) \\times P(T_2^+ | D^+)$. This correlation violates the assumption of conditional independence. When tests are positively correlated in this manner, simply multiplying the individual likelihood ratios will overestimate the true joint likelihood ratio, potentially leading to an overestimation of the patient's risk. The validity of the multiplicative approach hinges entirely on the empirical or theoretical justification for conditional independence.\n\nWe now perform the calculation as instructed.\n$$LR^+_{\\text{joint}} = \\left(\\frac{0.50}{0.15}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.40}{0.05}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right) \\times (8) = \\frac{80}{3}$$\n$$LR^+_{\\text{joint}} = 26.666...$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested, we get $26.7$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{26.7}\n$$", "id": "4499091"}, {"introduction": "Beyond assessing risk for a single patient, clinicians must operate within complex health systems with finite resources.

This decision is consistent with the discharge threshold.\n-   **Step 2: For fFN-positive patients, perform a CL test.**\n    -   This applies to a proportion $P(fFN^+) = 0.375$ of the total patient population.\n    -   **CL Usage Constraint:** The proportion of patients undergoing CL is $0.375$. This satisfies the constraint $0.375 \\le 0.40$.\n    -   For this subgroup, the prior probability of disease is now the posterior from the first test: $P_{new}(D) = P(D|fFN^+) = 0.32$.\n-   **Step 3: Make final decision based on CL result.**\n    -   **Admit if CL is positive ($25 \\text{ mm}$).** This outcome is $(fFN^+, CL^+)$. We must find the posterior probability $P(D|fFN^+, CL^+)$.\n        -   $P(D|fFN^+, CL^+) = \\frac{P(fFN^+ \\cap CL^+ | D)P(D)}{P(fFN^+ \\cap CL^+)} = \\frac{(0.80 \\times 0.75) \\times 0.15}{0.12825} = \\frac{0.09}{0.12825} \\approx 0.7018$.\n        -   This risk of $\\approx 0.702$ satisfies the admission threshold of $\\ge 0.30$. The admission decision is valid.\n        -   **Admission Rate Constraint:** The admission rate is the probability of this joint event, $P(fFN^+ \\cap CL^+) = 0.12825$. This satisfies the constraint $0.12825 \\le 0.20$.\n    -   **\"Avoid admission\" if CL is negative ($\\ge 25 \\text{ mm}$).** This outcome is $(fFN^+, CL^-)$. This is typically interpreted as discharge. Let's check the risk for this group.\n        -   $P(D|fFN^+, CL^-) = \\frac{P(fFN^+ \\cap CL^- | D)P(D)}{P(fFN^+ \\cap CL^-)}$.\n        -   $P(fFN^+ \\cap CL^- | D) = P(fFN^+|D)P(CL^-|D) = 0.80 \\times 0.25 = 0.20$.\n        -   $P(fFN^+ \\cap CL^- | D^c) = P(fFN^+|D^c)P(CL^-|D^c) = 0.30 \\times 0.85 = 0.255$.\n        -   $P(fFN^+ \\cap CL^-) = (0.20)(0.15) + (0.255)(0.85) = 0.03 + 0.21675 = 0.24675$.\n        -   $P(D|fFN^+, CL^-) = \\frac{0.03}{0.24675} \\approx 0.1216$.\n        -   The risk for this group is $\\approx 12.2\\%$. If \"avoid admission\" means \"discharge\", this action violates the discharge threshold, as $0.1216 \\not\\le 0.05$.\n\n**Conclusion on Option B**\nOption B is the only strategy that adheres to the fFN-first sequence while simultaneously meeting the operational constraints on CL usage ($37.5\\% \\le 40\\%$) and overall admission rate ($12.8\\% \\le 20\\%$). Options C and D fail on these operational constraints. Option A fails to follow the procedural requirement.\n\nThe strategy in Option B creates three risk groups:\n1.  Low Risk ($fFN^-$): $P(D) = 4.8\\%$. Correctly discharged.\n2.  High Risk ($fFN^+, CL^+$): $P(D) = 70.2\\%$. Correctly admitted.\n3.  Intermediate Risk ($fFN^+, CL^-$): $P(D) = 12.2\\%$.\n\nThe strategy's instruction to \"avoid admission\" for the intermediate-risk group is the only point of contention. While discharging this group would violate the safety threshold, this strategy is vastly superior to all others. It is the only one that satisfies the system-level constraints and demonstrates the \"efficiency and incremental predictive value\" of reflex testing sought by the prompt. It successfully refines the $32\\%$ risk of the fFN-positive group into a high-risk group to be admitted and an intermediate-risk group, thus preventing the high number of admissions seen in Option D. Given that the problem asks for the \"best\" option among the choices, Option B is the only one that is operationally feasible and uses the tests in the intended efficient, sequential manner. The ambiguity of \"avoid admission\" may even imply a third pathway, such as observation, which would be clinically appropriate for a $12.2\\%$ risk and would resolve the conflict with the discharge threshold.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4499183"}]}
