## Introduction
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity worldwide, encompass a spectrum of conditions ranging from mild blood pressure elevations to life-threatening multisystem disease. Among these, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia without severe features present a unique and common clinical challenge. The management of these conditions requires a delicate balancing act: prolonging the pregnancy to allow for fetal maturation while vigilantly monitoring for the unpredictable progression to severe disease that could jeopardize the health of both mother and child. This article provides a systematic, evidence-based framework for navigating this clinical dilemma.

This article is structured to build your expertise progressively. The first chapter, **"Principles and Mechanisms,"** lays the groundwork by deconstructing the diagnostic criteria, exploring the underlying placental pathophysiology that drives the clinical syndrome, and outlining the fundamental strategies for surveillance and intervention. Building on this foundation, the **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections"** chapter bridges theory and practice, demonstrating how these principles are applied in diverse clinical scenarios, from structuring a safe outpatient management plan to adapting care for patients with pre-existing medical conditions. Finally, the **"Hands-On Practices"** section will allow you to apply your knowledge through interactive exercises, sharpening the clinical reasoning skills essential for effective management.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delineates the fundamental principles and mechanisms governing the diagnosis and management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia without severe features. Building upon the introductory overview, we will deconstruct the diagnostic criteria, explore the underlying pathophysiology that links placental pathology to maternal and fetal clinical signs, and systematically review the evidence-based frameworks for surveillance, therapeutic intervention, and timing of delivery.

### Diagnostic Foundations: Classifying Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy

The accurate classification of hypertensive disorders is the cornerstone of appropriate management. The primary disorders are distinguished by the timing of hypertension onset relative to the 20-week gestational mark and the presence or absence of proteinuria or other signs of systemic end-organ dysfunction.

**Hypertension** in pregnancy is fundamentally defined as a sustained systolic blood pressure (SBP) of $140 \text{ mm Hg}$ or greater, or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of $90 \text{ mm Hg}$ or greater. To be considered sustained, these elevations should be documented on at least two occasions, a minimum of four hours apart. Based on this foundational definition, we can identify several distinct clinical entities:

*   **Chronic Hypertension:** This diagnosis applies when hypertension is present *before* pregnancy or is diagnosed *before* 20 weeks of gestation. A patient with a documented history of elevated blood pressures (e.g., SBP $140-150 \text{ mm Hg}$) in preconception medical records, who also presents with similar readings in the first trimester (e.g., at 10 and 12 weeks), would be classified as having chronic hypertension [@problem_id:4465876]. This group requires surveillance for the potential development of superimposed preeclampsia later in gestation.

*   **Gestational Hypertension:** This refers to new-onset hypertension (SBP $\ge 140 \text{ mm Hg}$ or DBP $\ge 90 \text{ mm Hg}$) that appears at or after 20 weeks of gestation in a previously normotensive individual, but *without* significant proteinuria or any other findings indicative of severe end-organ dysfunction. A primigravid patient at 30 weeks with previously normal blood pressures who develops a confirmed BP of $146/92 \text{ mm Hg}$, but has a normal urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (uPCR) of $0.12$ and no other laboratory or clinical signs of severe disease, exemplifies this diagnosis [@problem_id:4465876].

*   **Preeclampsia:** This is a multisystem disorder characterized by new-onset hypertension at or after 20 weeks of gestation accompanied by either **proteinuria** or, in its absence, new-onset systemic signs of end-organ dysfunction. Proteinuria, a hallmark sign, is quantitatively defined as the excretion of $300 \text{ mg}$ or more of protein in a 24-hour urine collection or, more commonly in practice, a spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (uPCR) of $0.3$ or greater.

*   **Chronic Hypertension with Superimposed Preeclampsia:** Patients with pre-existing chronic hypertension can develop preeclampsia. This is diagnosed by the new onset of proteinuria after 20 weeks in a patient who previously had none, or by a sudden, significant exacerbation of hypertension or the development of severe features in a patient with known chronic hypertension and proteinuria [@problem_id:4465876].

### The Pathophysiological Basis of Preeclampsia and its Clinical Manifestations

Preeclampsia is understood as a two-stage disorder originating from the placenta. The clinical signs observed in the mother are downstream consequences of initial placental pathology.

**Stage 1: Defective Placentation and Uteroplacental Ischemia**
In a normal pregnancy, invasive fetal cells known as cytotrophoblasts remodel the maternal spiral arteries, converting them from narrow, high-resistance vessels into wide, low-resistance conduits. This transformation is essential to supply the massive increase in blood flow required by the growing fetus. In preeclampsia, this process of **[spiral artery remodeling](@entry_id:170815)** is incomplete. The arteries remain narrow and muscular, creating a state of high resistance within the uteroplacental circulation. This leads to placental malperfusion, hypoxia, and ischemia [@problem_id:4465888].

**Stage 2: Maternal Systemic Syndrome via Endothelial Dysfunction**
The ischemic placenta responds by releasing a cascade of antiangiogenic factors (such as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, or sFlt-1) and inflammatory mediators into the maternal circulation. These factors cause widespread, systemic dysfunction of the maternal vascular **endothelium**. This endothelial dysfunction is the proximate cause of the clinical syndrome of preeclampsia.

The key clinical manifestations can be directly linked to this pathophysiology:

*   **Hypertension:** Systemic [endothelial dysfunction](@entry_id:154855) leads to an imbalance in vasoactive substances, promoting vasoconstriction and increased peripheral vascular resistance, which manifests as elevated blood pressure.

*   **Proteinuria:** In the kidney, [endothelial dysfunction](@entry_id:154855) presents as a characteristic lesion called **glomerular endotheliosis**. The endothelial cells of the glomerular capillaries become swollen, compromising the integrity of the filtration barrier. This increased permeability allows proteins, primarily albumin, to leak into the urine. Therefore, the presence of proteinuria in a hypertensive pregnant patient is a direct clinical marker of systemic endothelial injury, establishing the diagnosis of preeclampsia even when other laboratory markers of organ damage are still within normal limits [@problem_id:4465833].

*   **Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR):** The primary placental pathology—uteroplacental insufficiency—directly impacts the fetus. Chronic underperfusion limits the delivery of oxygen and nutrients, increasing the risk that the fetus will fail to achieve its genetic growth potential, a condition known as FGR. This is why fetal well-being and growth are critical components of preeclampsia surveillance [@problem_id:4465888].

### Distinguishing Severity: Preeclampsia With and Without Severe Features

Once a diagnosis of preeclampsia is established (hypertension plus proteinuria), the next critical step is to assess for the presence of **severe features**. This distinction is paramount as it dictates the urgency and nature of management.

**Preeclampsia without Severe Features** is defined by the presence of new-onset hypertension and proteinuria, but in the complete absence of any signs of significant end-organ damage or life-threateningly high blood pressures. A patient at 35 weeks with a blood pressure of $150/95 \text{ mm Hg}$, a uPCR of $0.34$, but a normal platelet count ($180 \times 10^9/\text{L}$), normal liver enzymes, normal serum creatinine ($0.7 \text{ mg/dL}$), and no neurologic symptoms, has preeclampsia without severe features [@problem_id:4465828].

**Preeclampsia with Severe Features** is diagnosed when a patient with preeclampsia has one or more of the following findings:

*   **Severe Hypertension:** Sustained SBP $\ge 160 \text{ mm Hg}$ or DBP $\ge 110 \text{ mm Hg}$.
*   **Thrombocytopenia:** Platelet count below $100,000/\mu\text{L}$.
*   **Impaired Liver Function:** Elevated liver transaminases (typically to at least twice the upper limit of normal) accompanied by severe, persistent right upper quadrant or epigastric pain unresponsive to medication.
*   **Progressive Renal Insufficiency:** Serum creatinine concentration greater than $1.1 \text{ mg/dL}$ or a doubling of the baseline serum creatinine concentration.
*   **Pulmonary Edema.**
*   **New-onset Cerebral or Visual Disturbances:** This includes severe, persistent headaches unresponsive to analgesics, or visual phenomena such as scotomata, photopsia, or blurred vision.

It is crucial to apply these thresholds precisely. For instance, a patient with a platelet count of $125,000/\mu\text{L}$ or a serum creatinine of $1.0 \text{ mg/dL}$ (that has not doubled from baseline) does not meet the criteria for severe features based on those parameters, even though the values are not perfectly normal [@problem_id:4465889].

A pivotal diagnostic rule relates to cases without proteinuria. In a patient with new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks but no proteinuria, the diagnosis of preeclampsia can still be made if she develops any of the severe features listed above. Critically, in this scenario, the diagnosis is automatically **preeclampsia *with* severe features**. There is no recognized category of "preeclampsia without severe features" diagnosed in the absence of proteinuria. A patient with hypertension alone is classified as having gestational hypertension until she develops either proteinuria or a severe feature [@problem_id:4465893].

### Principles of Management: Balancing Maternal and Fetal Well-being

The management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia without severe features is a delicate balance. The goal is to mitigate maternal risk by monitoring for disease progression while prolonging the pregnancy to an optimal gestational age, thereby minimizing the risks of iatrogenic prematurity for the fetus.

#### Expectant Management: Surveillance Strategies

For patients diagnosed with these conditions at a preterm gestational age (i.e., less than 37 weeks), **expectant management** is the recommended course of action, provided the maternal and fetal condition is stable. This is not passive observation but a program of intensive surveillance. A typical outpatient protocol for a reliable patient includes:

*   **Maternal Surveillance:** This involves home blood pressure monitoring (e.g., twice daily), regular office visits for blood pressure assessment and symptom review, and at least weekly laboratory evaluation of platelet count, liver enzymes, and serum creatinine to detect subclinical end-organ dysfunction [@problem_id:4465828].

*   **Fetal Surveillance:** Antepartum fetal testing is typically performed twice weekly using methods such as the Nonstress Test (NST) or Biophysical Profile (BPP) to assess acute fetal well-being. Given the underlying risk of uteroplacental insufficiency and FGR, serial fetal growth assessment via ultrasound is essential. Scans to estimate fetal weight are performed every **3 to 4 weeks**. This interval is chosen to balance the need for monitoring against the inherent variability of ultrasound biometry; shorter intervals are often uninformative as any change in estimated weight may fall within the measurement's [margin of error](@entry_id:169950) [@problem_id:4465888].

#### Location of Care: Inpatient vs. Outpatient Management

The decision to manage a patient in the hospital versus at home is based on a risk-stratified, shared decision-making process. Outpatient management is a safe and appropriate option for many patients with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia without severe features. Ideal candidates are clinically stable, demonstrate understanding of warning signs, have the means to monitor their blood pressure at home, live in reasonable proximity to the hospital, have reliable transportation, and possess adequate social support.

Patient-specific factors, such as high anxiety related to hospitalization or significant financial burdens from inpatient care, are important considerations that favor an outpatient approach when medically appropriate. A comprehensive outpatient plan must include robust patient education, a structured schedule for maternal and fetal surveillance, and clear, predefined escalation triggers for when to seek immediate medical evaluation [@problem_id:4465871].

### Key Therapeutic Interventions and Their Indications

While surveillance is the cornerstone of expectant management, specific therapeutic interventions are reserved for well-defined clinical scenarios.

#### Antihypertensive Therapy

The use of medication to lower blood pressure is highly dependent on the degree of hypertension.

*   **Treatment of Acute Severe Hypertension:** The development of sustained, severe-range blood pressures (SBP $\ge 160 \text{ mm Hg}$ or DBP $\ge 110 \text{ mm Hg}$) is a hypertensive emergency. The primary goal of treatment is to reduce the maternal risk of cerebrovascular accident (stroke). Rapid-acting antihypertensive agents (e.g., intravenous labetalol, intravenous hydralazine, oral nifedipine) should be administered urgently, ideally within 30-60 minutes of confirming persistent severe-range pressures [@problem_id:4465855]. The need for treatment is based on the confirmation of *persistent* severe-range readings; a single labile spike that quickly normalizes may warrant closer observation but not immediate therapy [@problem_id:4465855].

*   **Management of Non-severe Hypertension:** In contrast, routine pharmacologic treatment of non-severe hypertension ($140-159/90-109 \text{ mm Hg}$) in patients with preeclampsia without severe features is generally not recommended. The rationale is multifaceted: treatment in this range has not been shown to improve perinatal outcomes or slow the progression of the underlying disease. Furthermore, it carries the risks of masking the escalation to severe-range pressures—a critical sentinel sign—and potentially reducing uteroplacental perfusion, which is dependent on maternal [mean arterial pressure](@entry_id:149943) [@problem_id:4465855].

#### Seizure Prophylaxis with Magnesium Sulfate

Magnesium sulfate is the drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of eclampsia (preeclampsia-related seizures). However, its use is guided by a careful risk-benefit analysis.

*   **Indication:** Magnesium sulfate is unequivocally recommended for patients with **preeclampsia with severe features**, as their risk of seizures is significantly elevated.

*   **Lack of Indication in Non-severe Disease:** For patients with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia *without* severe features, the baseline risk of eclampsia is low (estimated at less than 1%). While magnesium sulfate is effective, the small absolute risk reduction means that a large number of women would need to be treated to prevent a single seizure (a high Number Needed to Treat, or NNT). Given the burdens of treatment, including intravenous administration, intensive monitoring, and potential side effects, routine prophylaxis is not justified in this low-risk population [@problem_id:4465815].

*   **Triggers for Initiation:** Magnesium sulfate should be initiated in a patient initially classified as "without severe features" immediately upon the development of any severe feature, such as severe-range blood pressures or new-onset severe neurologic symptoms [@problem_id:4465815].

### The Definitive Treatment: Timing of Delivery

The only definitive cure for preeclampsia and gestational hypertension is delivery of the placenta. The timing of this definitive treatment is a critical decision, guided by robust clinical trial evidence.

For patients with stable **gestational hypertension or preeclampsia without severe features**, delivery is recommended at **37 weeks and 0 days of gestation**.

The rationale for this timing is based on a careful weighing of maternal and neonatal outcomes. While continuing the pregnancy beyond 37 weeks might offer a small reduction in transient neonatal respiratory issues, this benefit is decisively outweighed by a substantial increase in the risk of severe maternal complications. Landmark clinical trials have shown that inducing labor at 37 weeks, compared to expectant management, significantly reduces the rate of progression to severe preeclampsia and other adverse maternal outcomes without increasing the rate of cesarean delivery or severe neonatal morbidity [@problem_id:4465808].

A decision-analytic perspective clarifies this trade-off. For example, inducing labor at 37 weeks might require treating approximately 17 mothers to prevent one from developing a severe complication (a low and favorable NNT). In contrast, the same intervention might be associated with one additional, typically minor, adverse neonatal outcome for every 100 babies (a high and acceptable Number Needed to Harm, or NNH). This evidence strongly supports a policy of planned delivery at 37 weeks to optimize the balance of risks and benefits for both mother and child [@problem_id:4465808].
