It relies on standard, formal definitions from its field.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two epidemiological metrics: the Absolute Risk Difference (ARD) and the Number Needed to Harm (NNH).\n\nFirst, the risks provided as percentages are converted to decimal proportions for calculation.\nThe risk of uterine rupture for TOLAC is given as $R_{\\text{TOLAC}} = 0.5\\%$. As a decimal proportion, this is:\n$$R_{\\text{TOLAC}} = \\frac{0.5}{100} = 0.005$$\nThe risk of uterine rupture for ERCS is given as $R_{\\text{ERCS}} = 0.02\\%$. As a decimal proportion, this is:\n$$R_{\\text{ERCS}} = \\frac{0.02}{100} = 0.0002$$\n\nThe Absolute Risk Difference (ARD) is defined as the difference in risk between the two strategies. The problem specifies the ARD attributable to choosing TOLAC (the more harmful strategy in this context) rather than ERCS (the comparator). Therefore, the ARD is calculated as:\n$$ARD = R_{\\text{TOLAC}} - R_{\\text{ERCS}}$$\nSubstituting the decimal values:\n$$ARD = 0.005 - 0.0002 = 0.0048$$\nThis value represents the excess risk of uterine rupture incurred for each individual who undergoes TOLAC instead of ERCS.\n\nNext, the Number Needed to Harm (NNH) is calculated. The NNH represents the number of patients who would need to be treated with the more harmful intervention (TOLAC) for one additional adverse outcome (uterine rupture) to occur, on average, compared to the comparator intervention (ERCS). It is formally defined in the problem as the smallest integer greater than or equal to the reciprocal of the ARD. This is equivalent to applying the ceiling function to the reciprocal of the ARD.\n$$NNH = \\left\\lceil \\frac{1}{ARD} \\right\\rceil$$\nUsing the calculated value of ARD:\n$$NNH = \\left\\lceil \\frac{1}{0.0048} \\right\\rceil$$\nTo compute the value inside the ceiling function, we can express the decimal as a fraction:\n$$\\frac{1}{0.0048} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{48}{10000}} = \\frac{10000}{48}$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$\\frac{10000}{48} = \\frac{5000}{24} = \\frac{2500}{12} = \\frac{1250}{6} = \\frac{625}{3}$$\nNow, we convert this fraction to a decimal to apply the ceiling function:\n$$\\frac{625}{3} = 208.333...$$\nApplying the ceiling function, which rounds up to the next integer:\n$$NNH = \\lceil 208.333... \\rceil = 209$$\nThis means that for every $209$ individuals who choose TOLAC over ERCS, one additional case of uterine rupture is expected to occur on average.\n\nThe final result is requested as an ordered pair $\\left(\\text{ARD}, \\text{NNH}\\right)$.\n$$(\\text{ARD}, \\text{NNH}) = (0.0048, 209)$$\nThe result is presented as a row matrix as per the output formatting instructions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.0048 & 209 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4517767"}, {"introduction": "Once a TOLAC is underway, the focus shifts to intrapartum monitoring and the timely detection of uterine rupture.

The expected utility is determined by weighting the utility of each possible outcome by its probability. The TOLAC strategy has two mutually exclusive outcomes: a successful Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC) or a failed TOLAC resulting in an emergency repeat cesarean section.\n\nLet $E[U_{TOLAC}]$ be the expected utility of the TOLAC strategy. Let $U_S$ be the utility of a successful VBAC and $U_F$ be the utility of a failed TOLAC. Let $p_S$ be the probability of a successful VBAC. The expected utility is given by:\n$$\nE[U_{TOLAC}] = p_S \\cdot U_S + (1 - p_S) \\cdot U_F\n$$\nThe utility of each outcome is measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). The baseline utility for a $1$-year horizon with no morbidity is $1.0$ QALY. Disutility is measured as a decrement from this baseline. A disutility decrement is calculated as the product of the disutility magnitude and its duration in years. For probabilistic health events, the expected disutility decrement is used.\n\nFirst, we must convert all time durations into years, using the given conversion of $1$ year $= 52$ weeks.\n- Recovery from VBAC: $3$ weeks $= \\frac{3}{52}$ years.\n- Recovery from cesarean: $6$ weeks $= \\frac{6}{52}$ years.\n- PPH morbidity duration: $2$ weeks $= \\frac{2}{52}$ years.\n\nNext, we calculate the utility for each outcome branch.\n\n**1.
