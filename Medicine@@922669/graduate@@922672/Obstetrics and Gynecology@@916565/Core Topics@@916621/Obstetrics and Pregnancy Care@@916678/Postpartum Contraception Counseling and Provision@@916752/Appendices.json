She has resumed vaginal intercourse and reports an average of two acts per week, without using contraception. She asks if she needs contraception now and how high her risk of pregnancy is over the next month if she does not start a method today. Use the following scientifically grounded assumptions to model her near-term risk, and combine them with first principles of probability:\n\n1) By definition, the Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM) requires three criteria: exclusive or near-exclusive breastfeeding, amenorrhea, and being less than 6 months postpartum. Because she does not meet the exclusive or near-exclusive breastfeeding criterion, treat LAM as not applicable for her protection.\n\n2) Over the next 4 weeks, assume the timing of the first ovulation follows a Poisson process with a constant weekly hazard of first ovulation of $h = 0.08$ per week for a partially breastfeeding, amenorrheic individual at 10 weeks postpartum. Assume at most one ovulation occurs in this 4-week interval.\n\n3) If an ovulation occurs, assume there is exactly one fertile window of $w = 6$ days in which conception is biologically possible. Acts of intercourse falling outside this window have $0$ probability of conception. Acts within this window each have an independent conception probability of $q = 0.08$.\n\n4) Over the 4-week horizon, there are $D = 28$ days and she will have $N = 8$ acts of intercourse, occurring independently and uniformly at random across the $D$ days.\n\nUsing only the above and fundamental probability rules, compute the probability (as a decimal) that she will become pregnant in the next 4 weeks if she uses no contraception.

Your numerical answer should reflect only the computed probability.", "solution": "### Part 1: Probability of Pregnancy\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the total probability of pregnancy, which we denote as the event $E$, over a $T=4$-week period. This probability can be determined using the law of total probability, by conditioning on whether ovulation, event $O$, occurs during this interval. The formula is:\n$$P(E) = P(E|O)P(O) + P(E|O^c)P(O^c)$$\nwhere $O^c$ is the complement of $O$ (no ovulation).\n\nFirst, we must calculate the probabilities of the conditioning events, $P(O)$ and $P(O^c)$. The problem states that the timing of the first ovulation follows a Poisson process with a constant weekly hazard rate of $h = 0.08$. The time horizon is $T=4$ weeks. The number of events (ovulations) in a time interval $T$ in a Poisson process with rate $h$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = hT$. The probability of having zero events is $P(\\text{no events}) = \\exp(-\\lambda) = \\exp(-hT)$. The problem specifies that we assume at most one ovulation occurs. Under this assumption, the event $O$ (ovulation occurs) is equivalent to the event of \"at least one ovulation\". Therefore, the probability of ovulation is:\n$$P(O) = 1 - P(O^c) = 1 - \\exp(-hT)$$\nSubstituting the given values, $h = 0.08 \\text{ week}^{-1}$ and $T=4$ weeks:\n$$P(O) = 1 - \\exp(-0.08 \\times 4) = 1 - \\exp(-0.32)$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the conditional probabilities of pregnancy.\nIf no ovulation occurs ($O^c$), pregnancy is biologically impossible. Thus, the probability of pregnancy given no ovulation is zero:\n$$P(E|O^c) = 0$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the probability of pregnancy given that ovulation does occur, $P(E|O)$. The problem provides the following parameters:\n-   A fertile window of $w=6$ days.\n-   A total time horizon of $D=28$ days (for the $4$-week period).\n-   $N=8$ acts of intercourse, occurring independently and uniformly at random across the $D$ days.\n-   A per-act probability of conception $q=0.08$ if the act falls within the fertile window.\n\nGiven that one ovulation has occurred, the $w=6$ day fertile window is placed somewhere within the $D=28$ day interval. Because the intercourse acts are distributed uniformly at random, the probability that any single act of intercourse falls within this specific fertile window is $p_{\\text{hit}} = \\frac{w}{D}$.\n$$p_{\\text{hit}} = \\frac{6}{28} = \\frac{3}{14}$$\nFor pregnancy to result from a single act of intercourse, two conditions must be met: the act must occur within the fertile window (with probability $p_{\\text{hit}}$), and it must result in conception (with probability $q$). Since these are independent, the probability that a single, randomly placed act of intercourse leads to pregnancy is $p_{\\text{preg,act}} = p_{\\text{hit}} \\times q$.\nThe probability that a single random act does *not* lead to pregnancy is therefore $1 - p_{\\text{preg,act}} = 1 - \\frac{w}{D}q$.\n\nSince there are $N=8$ independent acts of intercourse, the probability that *none* of them result in pregnancy is the product of their individual probabilities of not causing pregnancy:\n$$P(\\text{no pregnancy}|O) = \\left(1 - \\frac{w}{D}q\\right)^N$$\nThe event of pregnancy, $E$, given ovulation $O$, occurs if at least one act of intercourse results in conception. This is the complement of the event that no acts result in pregnancy.\n$$P(E|O) = 1 - P(\\text{no pregnancy}|O) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{w}{D}q\\right)^N$$\n\nNow we can combine all the pieces into the formula for the total probability of pregnancy:\n$$P(E) = P(E|O)P(O) + P(E|O^c)P(O^c)$$\n$$P(E) = \\left(1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{w}{D}q\\right)^N\\right) (1 - \\exp(-hT)) + (0) \\times P(O^c)$$\n$$P(E) = \\left(1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{w}{D}q\\right)^N\\right) (1 - \\exp(-hT))$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n-   $w=6$\n-   $D=28$\n-   $q=0.08$\n-   $N=8$\n-   $h=0.08$\n-   $T=4$\n\n$$P(E) = \\left(1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{6}{28} \\times 0.08\\right)^8\\right) (1 - \\exp(-0.08 \\times 4))$$\n$$P(E) = \\left(1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{3}{14} \\times 0.08\\right)^8\\right) (1 - \\exp(-0.32))$$\n$$P(E) \\approx \\left(1 - (1 - 0.2142857 \\times 0.08)^8\\right) (1 - 0.726149)$$\n$$P(E) \\approx \\left(1 - (1 - 0.01714286)^8\\right) (0.273851)$$\n$$P(E) \\approx \\left(1 - (0.98285714)^8\\right) (0.273851)$$\n$$P(E) \\approx (1 - 0.870850) (0.273851)$$\n$$P(E) \\approx (0.129150) (0.273851)$$\n$$P(E) \\approx 0.0353683$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the probability is $0.0354$.\n\n### Part 2: Contraceptive Options\n\nBased on well-established medical eligibility criteria (such as the U.S. CDC Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use), a patient who is $10$ weeks postpartum and partially breastfeeding has several appropriate contraceptive options. At this time point ($>6$ weeks postpartum), the risk of venous thromboembolism has returned to baseline, and concerns about hormonal effects on milk supply are lessened. Two highly effective and appropriate options that can be initiated today are:\n1.  The **progestin-only implant** (e.g., etonogestrel implant). It is a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method. For breastfeeding individuals, it can be placed anytime after $4$ weeks postpartum. It is considered a Category $1$ option by the CDC (no restriction on use).\n2.  A **levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD)**. This is another LARC method that is placed in the uterus and provides contraception for several years. It is also considered a CDC Category $1$ option for initiation anytime after $4$ weeks postpartum in breastfeeding individuals. The non-hormonal copper IUD is also a Category $1$ option.\n\nBoth of these methods are highly effective and can be initiated at her current visit at $10$ weeks postpartum.
