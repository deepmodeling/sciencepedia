To avoid Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST), the maximal safe total dose is governed by two empirically established and widely used constraints: (i) a body-mass proportional limit of $4.5$ mg/kg for plain lidocaine and $7.0$ mg/kg when lidocaine is co-administered with epinephrine, reflecting reduced systemic absorption with vasoconstriction; and (ii) an absolute ceiling dose beyond which non-linear pharmacokinetics and clinical convention advise no further increase, taken here as $300$ mg for plain lidocaine and $500$ mg with epinephrine.\n\nStarting from the fundamental proportionality that a mass-normalized toxicity threshold implies a linear scaling $D \\propto m$ with proportionality constant given by the mg/kg limit, and the independent absolute ceiling that truncates any larger mass-scaled value, derive a single closed-form expression for the maximal safe total dose $D(m)$ (in milligrams) that correctly combines these two constraints for (a) plain lidocaine and (b) lidocaine with epinephrine.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of pharmacology, is mathematically well-posed, and is presented in a clear, objective, and complete manner. No flaws related to scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, or ambiguity were detected.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a single closed-form expression for the maximal safe total dose of lidocaine, $D(m)$, as a function of patient body mass $m$. The dose is constrained by two independent conditions: a mass-proportional limit and an absolute ceiling. For a dose to be safe, it must satisfy both constraints simultaneously. This means the dose must be less than or equal to the mass-proportional value AND less than or equal to the absolute ceiling value. The maximal safe dose is therefore the largest value that meets both criteria.\n\nLet $k$ be the mass-proportionality constant in mg/kg, and let $C$ be the absolute ceiling dose in mg. The mass-proportional upper bound is given by the linear function $k \\cdot m$. The two constraints on the dose $D$ can be written as:\n$$D \\le k \\cdot m$$\n$$D \\le C$$\nTo find the maximal safe dose, $D(m)$, we must find the largest value that satisfies both inequalities. This is mathematically expressed as the minimum of the two upper bounds:\n$$D(m) = \\min(k \\cdot m, C)$$\nThis single closed-form expression correctly combines the two constraints. The dose increases linearly with mass according to $k \\cdot m$ until it reaches the ceiling $C$, at which point the dose is truncated and remains constant at $C$ for any larger mass.\n\nWe will now apply this general formula to the two specific cases provided.\n\n(a) Plain Lidocaine\nThe given parameters are the mass-proportional limit $k_{\\text{plain}} = 4.5 \\, \\text{mg/kg}$ and the absolute ceiling dose $C_{\\text{plain}} = 300 \\, \\text{mg}$.\nThe maximal safe dose function for plain lidocaine is:\n$$D_{\\text{plain}}(m) = \\min(4.5 \\cdot m, 300)$$\n\n(b) Lidocaine with Epinephrine\nThe given parameters are the mass-proportional limit $k_{\\text{epi}} = 7.0 \\, \\text{mg/kg}$ and the absolute ceiling dose $C_{\\text{epi}} = 500 \\, \\text{mg}$.\nThe maximal safe dose function for lidocaine with epinephrine is:\n$$D_{\\text{epi}}(m) = \\min(7.0 \\cdot m, 500)$$\n\nNext, we compute the values of these functions for a patient with a body mass of $m = 68 \\, \\text{kg}$.\n\nFor plain lidocaine:\nFirst, we calculate the mass-proportional dose:\n$$4.5 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} \\times 68 \\, \\text{kg} = 306 \\, \\text{mg}$$\nThen, we apply the function $D_{\\text{plain}}(68)$:\n$$D_{\\text{plain}}(68) = \\min(306 \\, \\text{mg}, 300 \\, \\text{mg}) = 300 \\, \\text{mg}$$\nIn this case, the mass-proportional calculation exceeds the absolute ceiling, so the dose is capped at $300 \\, \\text{mg}$.\n\nFor lidocaine with epinephrine:\nFirst, we calculate the mass-proportional dose:\n$$7.0 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} \\times 68 \\, \\text{kg} = 476 \\, \\text{mg}$$\nThen, we apply the function $D_{\\text{epi}}(68)$:\n$$D_{\\text{epi}}(68) = \\min(476 \\, \\text{mg}, 500 \\, \\text{mg}) = 476 \\, \\text{mg}$$\nIn this case, the mass-proportional dose is below the absolute ceiling, so it is the governing limit.\n\nThe problem asks for the final numerical results to be presented as a row vector, rounded to four significant figures.\nThe calculated value for plain lidocaine is $300 \\, \\text{mg}$.
