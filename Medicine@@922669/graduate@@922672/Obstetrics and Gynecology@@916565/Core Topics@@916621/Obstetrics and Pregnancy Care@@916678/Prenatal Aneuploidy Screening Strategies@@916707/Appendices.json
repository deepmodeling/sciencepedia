This is the true negative rate.\n    $$Sp = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95$$\n\nFrom the definition of specificity, we can deduce the false positive rate (FPR), which is the probability of a positive test result given that the condition is absent:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nThe problem asks for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is defined as the probability that the condition is truly present given a positive test result. This is the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nTo derive the expression for PPV, we apply Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. We can calculate this using the law of total probability, by summing the probabilities of the two mutually exclusive ways a positive result can occur: a true positive ($T^+$ and $D$) and a false positive ($T^+$ and $D^c$).\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se \\cdot p) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - p))$$\n\nNow we substitute this expanded form of $P(T^+)$ back into the Bayes' theorem expression for PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}$$\nThis can be written in terms of the given parameters as:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{(Se \\cdot p) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - p))}$$\nThis is the required general expression for the Positive Predictive Value.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the given parameters: $Se = 0.90$, $Sp = 0.95$, and $p = 0.005$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the individual components:\n- The probability of a true positive (a person has T21 and tests positive):\n$$P(T^+ \\cap D) = Se \\cdot p = 0.90 \\times 0.005 = 0.0045$$\n- The probability of a false positive (a person does not have T21 but tests positive):\n$$P(T^+ \\cap D^c) = (1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - p) = (1 - 0.95) \\times (1 - 0.005) = 0.05 \\times 0.995 = 0.04975$$\n\nThe total probability of a positive test is the sum of these two probabilities:\n$$P(T^+) = 0.0045 + 0.04975 = 0.05425$$\n\nFinally, we compute the PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.0045}{0.05425} \\approx 0.08294930875...$$\n\nRounding this value to four significant figures, we get:\n$$PPV \\approx 0.08295$$\n\n**Explanation for Patient Counseling:**\n\nA calculated Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of approximately $0.083$, or $8.3\\%$, is a critical piece of information for patient counseling following a positive screening result. The key points to communicate are:\n\n1.  **Distinction between Screening and Diagnostic Testing**: It must be emphasized that the first-trimester combined screen is a *screening* test, not a *diagnostic* test. Its purpose is to identify individuals at a higher risk for T21 from the general population, not to definitively determine if the fetus has the condition. A positive result means the patient is in a higher-risk group and warrants further, more definitive testing.\n\n2.  **Interpretation of the PPV**: A PPV of $0.08295$ means that, among all individuals who receive a positive screening result in this population, only about $8.3\\%$ will actually have a fetus with T21. Conversely, approximately $91.7\\%$ of positive results are *false positives*, meaning the fetus does not have T21 despite the positive screen. This context is essential to mitigate patient anxiety and prevent the misconception that a positive screen is equivalent to a diagnosis.\n\n3.  **Implications of Condition Rarity (Low Prevalence)**: The low PPV, despite the test's high sensitivity ($90\\%$) and specificity ($95\\%$), is a direct consequence of the low prevalence of T21 ($p=0.005$, or $1$ in $200$). In a large population, the vast majority of individuals are unaffected ($99.5\\%$). The false positive rate of $5\\%$ ($1 - Sp$), when applied to this very large unaffected group, generates a substantial number of false positive results. This number of false positives ($0.04975$ of the total population) is much larger than the number of true positives ($0.0045$ of the total population) identified from the small affected group. The pool of individuals with positive tests is therefore dominated by false positives, leading to the low PPV. This highlights a fundamental principle of screening for rare diseases.\n\nIn summary, the positive screening result does not diagnose T21 but revises the risk from the background population risk ($0.5\\%$) to a new, higher risk ($8.3\\%$). This revised risk provides a clear rationale for discussing the option of definitive diagnostic tests, such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis, which have near-perfect accuracy but carry a small procedural risk.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.08295}$$", "id": "4498630"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple positive or negative results, prenatal screening often involves continuous measurements like nuchal translucency ($NT$), where the degree of abnormality matters.
