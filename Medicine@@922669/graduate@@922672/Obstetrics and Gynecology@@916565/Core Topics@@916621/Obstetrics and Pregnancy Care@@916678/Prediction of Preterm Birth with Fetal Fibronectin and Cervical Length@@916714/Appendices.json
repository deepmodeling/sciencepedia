This exercise demonstrates the fundamental principles of Bayesian reasoning by using likelihood ratios to quantify the impact of a single diagnostic test on a patient's pre-test probability of preterm birth. By working through the conversion of probability to odds, applying the likelihood ratio, and converting back to a post-test probability, you will gain a core skill for interpreting test results in a quantitatively rigorous way.", "problem": "A pregnant patient presents with symptoms of possible preterm labor. A validated triage model that integrates transvaginal cervical length and clinical features estimates her pretest probability of delivery within $7$ days as $0.10$. You perform a Fetal Fibronectin (FFN) test and plan to update the risk using the likelihood ratio approach, where the likelihood ratio for a positive test is $LR_{+}=6$ and for a negative test is $LR_{-}=0.2$. Starting only from the definitions of pretest probability, odds, and likelihood ratio, derive the expressions needed to convert a pretest probability to a posttest probability for both a positive and a negative FFN result, then compute the two posttest probabilities. Finally, provide a brief clinical interpretation of each result in terms of how they would influence management decisions in obstetric triage. Express the final probabilities as decimals and round your answers to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the formula for post-test probability using the likelihood ratio approach and then the calculation of these probabilities for a given clinical scenario. The validation check confirms that the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient delivers within $7$ days, and let $\\neg D$ be the complementary event that she does not. Let $T_+$ denote a positive Fetal Fibronectin (FFN) test result and $T_-$ denote a negative result.\n\nThe pretest probability of delivery is given as $P(D) = 0.10$. The probability of not delivering is $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n\nThe first step in the likelihood ratio method is to convert the pretest probability into pretest odds. The odds of an event $A$ are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring:\n$$O(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{1 - P(A)}$$\nThus, the pretest odds of delivery, $O_{\\text{pre}}$, are:\n$$O_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(\\neg D)} = \\frac{0.10}{0.90} = \\frac{1}{9}$$\n\nThe likelihood ratio ($LR$) quantifies the diagnostic power of a test. The likelihood ratio for a positive test, $LR_{+}$, is the ratio of the probability of a positive test in a patient who will deliver to the probability of a positive test in a patient who will not deliver:\n$$LR_{+} = \\frac{P(T_+ | D)}{P(T_+ | \\neg D)}$$\nSimilarly, the likelihood ratio for a negative test, $LR_{-}$, is:\n$$LR_{-} = \\frac{P(T_- | D)}{P(T_- | \\neg D)}$$\nThe problem provides these values as $LR_{+} = 6$ and $LR_{-} = 0.2$.\n\nThe core of the method is the conversion from pretest odds to post-test odds using the likelihood ratio:\n$$O_{\\text{post}} = O_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR$$\nTo derive this relationship, we use Bayes' theorem. The post-test probability, given a positive test result, is $P(D | T_+)$. The post-test odds, $O_{\\text{post,+}}$, are therefore:\n$$O_{\\text{post,+}} = \\frac{P(D | T_+)}{P(\\neg D | T_+)}$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$, we can write:\n$$P(D | T_+) = \\frac{P(T_+ | D) P(D)}{P(T_+)}$$\n$$P(\\neg D | T_+) = \\frac{P(T_+ | \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}{P(T_+)}$$\nSubstituting these into the odds equation:\n$$O_{\\text{post,+}} = \\frac{\\frac{P(T_+ | D) P(D)}{P(T_+)}}{\\frac{P(T_+ | \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}{P(T_+)}} = \\frac{P(T_+ | D)}{P(T_+ | \\neg D)} \\times \\frac{P(D)}{P(\\neg D)}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$O_{\\text{post,+}} = LR_{+} \\times O_{\\text{pre}}$$\nA parallel derivation yields the same relationship for a negative test:\n$$O_{\\text{post,-}} = LR_{-} \\times O_{\\text{pre}}$$\n\nThe final step is to convert the post-test odds back into a post-test probability. If $O = \\frac{P}{1-P}$, we can solve for $P$:\n$O(1-P) = P$\n$O - O \\cdot P = P$\n$O = P + O \\cdot P = P(1+O)$\n$$P = \\frac{O}{1+O}$$\nThis is the required expression to convert odds to probability.\n\nNow we can compute the post-test probabilities for the patient.\n\nCase 1: Positive FFN Test ($T_+$)\nThe pretest odds are $O_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{1}{9}$ and the likelihood ratio is $LR_{+} = 6$.\nThe post-test odds are:\n$$O_{\\text{post,+}} = O_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR_{+} = \\frac{1}{9} \\times 6 = \\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nThe post-test probability, $P_{\\text{post,+}}$, is:\n$$P_{\\text{post,+}} = \\frac{O_{\\text{post,+}}}{1 + O_{\\text{post,+}}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}}{1 + \\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}}{\\frac{5}{3}} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.4000$.\n\nCase 2: Negative FFN Test ($T_-$)\nThe pretest odds are $O_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{1}{9}$ and the likelihood ratio is $LR_{-} = 0.2$.\nThe post-test odds are:\n$$O_{\\text{post,-}} = O_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR_{-} = \\frac{1}{9} \\times 0.2 = \\frac{1}{9} \\times \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{2}{90} = \\frac{1}{45}$$\nThe post-test probability, $P_{\\text{post,-}}$, is:\n$$P_{\\text{post,-}} = \\frac{O_{\\text{post,-}}}{1 + O_{\\text{post,-}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{45}}{1 + \\frac{1}{45}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{45}}{\\frac{46}{45}} = \\frac{1}{46}$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.02173913...$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $0.02174$.\n\nClinical Interpretation:\nA positive FFN result increases the patient's estimated risk of delivery within $7$ days from a baseline of $10\\%$ to $40\\%$. This is a four-fold increase and elevates her into a high-risk category. Such a result would justify hospital admission, administration of antenatal corticosteroids to promote fetal lung maturation, and close monitoring, potentially including tocolytic therapy.\n\nA negative FFN result decreases the patient's risk from $10\\%$ to approximately $2.2\\%$. This low post-test probability provides strong reassurance that preterm delivery is unlikely in the next $7$ days. The FFN test serves as an excellent 'rule-out' test. This result would support a management decision of sending the patient home from triage with appropriate precautions, thereby avoiding the costs, risks, and stress of unnecessary hospitalization and intervention.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.4000  0.02174\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4495944"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the principles of single-test risk modification [@problem_id:4495944], this exercise addresses the common clinical scenario of integrating multiple diagnostic findings.
