## Introduction
Chronic hypertension is a common and increasingly prevalent medical condition complicating pregnancy, posing significant risks to both mother and fetus. Its management presents a complex challenge, requiring a delicate balance between controlling maternal blood pressure and ensuring adequate uteroplacental perfusion. Understanding the underlying pathophysiology and the evidence behind modern therapeutic strategies is crucial for clinicians aiming to mitigate these risks and optimize outcomes. This article provides a thorough exploration of chronic hypertension in pregnancy. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, delves into the fundamental definitions, pathophysiology, and the evidence base for management, explaining how pre-existing hypertension interacts with the unique physiology of pregnancy. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, translates this foundational knowledge into clinical practice, covering management from preconception through the postpartum period and highlighting its links to fields like cardiology and public health. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will allow you to apply these concepts to realistic clinical scenarios, solidifying your decision-making skills.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### Defining and Diagnosing Chronic Hypertension in Pregnancy

The management of any clinical condition begins with a precise and rigorous definition. In the context of pregnancy, hypertensive disorders are classified based on their timing of onset relative to gestation and their resolution postpartum. This framework is crucial for distinguishing conditions with different underlying pathophysiologies and prognoses.

#### The Foundational Definition and Its Distinctions

**Chronic hypertension** in pregnancy is fundamentally defined as hypertension that predates the gestational state or is identified early within it. The formal diagnostic criteria are: (1) a documented history of hypertension with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of $140$ $\mathrm{mmHg}$ or greater, or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of $90$ $\mathrm{mmHg}$ or greater, before conception; (2) the new identification of hypertension (SBP $\geq 140$ $\mathrm{mmHg}$ or DBP $\geq 90$ $\mathrm{mmHg}$ on at least two occasions, a minimum of four hours apart) **before 20 weeks of gestation**; or (3) hypertension that is first diagnosed during pregnancy and **persists for more than 12 weeks postpartum**.

This definition clearly distinguishes chronic hypertension from the other major hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. **Gestational hypertension** is new-onset hypertension (SBP $\geq 140$ $\mathrm{mmHg}$ or DBP $\geq 90$ $\mathrm{mmHg}$) that appears for the first time **at or after 20 weeks of gestation** in a previously normotensive individual. Critically, it is characterized by the absence of proteinuria or other signs of end-organ dysfunction. For the diagnosis to be confirmed, the blood pressure must normalize by 12 weeks postpartum. If it persists, the diagnosis is retrospectively changed to chronic hypertension. **Preeclampsia** is a multi-system, placentally-mediated syndrome also defined by new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation. However, it is accompanied by either **proteinuria** (defined as $\geq 300$ $\mathrm{mg}$ in a 24-hour urine collection, or a spot urine protein/creatinine ratio of $\geq 0.3$) or, in the absence of proteinuria, the new onset of **end-organ dysfunction**, also known as severe features. These features include thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, impaired liver function, pulmonary edema, or new-onset cerebral or visual disturbances [@problem_id:4413796].

A crucial and high-risk clinical entity is **chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia**. This occurs when a patient with pre-existing chronic hypertension develops, after 20 weeks of gestation, new-onset proteinuria, a sudden exacerbation of baseline proteinuria, a sudden worsening of hypertension, or any of the severe features of preeclampsia [@problem_id:4413833].

#### The Critical Importance of Accurate Measurement

The diagnosis of any hypertensive disorder is contingent upon the accurate measurement of blood pressure. Failure to adhere to a standardized technique can introduce significant errors, leading to both over- and under-diagnosis. Best practice for office blood [pressure measurement](@entry_id:146274) dictates a protocol designed to capture a patient's true resting state. This includes having the patient rest quietly for at least five minutes in a chair with their back supported, feet flat on the floor, and legs uncrossed. The arm should be bare and supported so that the brachial artery is at the level of the heart (approximated by the mid-sternum).

The choice of cuff size is paramount. The inflatable bladder of the cuff should have a width approximately $40\%$ of the arm circumference and a length that encircles $80\%$ to $100\%$ of the arm. Using a cuff that is too small for the patient's arm, a common error, will falsely elevate the blood pressure reading, often by $5$ to $15$ $\mathrm{mmHg}$, because excessive pressure is needed to compress the artery. Conversely, an oversized cuff can lead to a falsely low reading.

Arm position relative to the heart also has a predictable effect based on fundamental physics. When the arm is positioned below the heart, the reading is artefactually increased by the hydrostatic pressure of the column of blood between the heart and the cuff. For every centimeter the cuff is below the heart, the pressure reading is overestimated by approximately $0.8$ $\mathrm{mmHg}$. Therefore, an arm resting on a lap $15$ $\mathrm{cm}$ below the heart can falsely elevate the reading by about $12$ $\mathrm{mmHg}$. Other common errors, such as measuring immediately after the patient has walked into the room or while the patient is talking, can each transiently raise blood pressure by several millimeters of mercury due to sympathetic activation [@problem_id:4413837].

#### Beyond the Clinic: Unmasking True Blood Pressure Patterns

Even with meticulous technique, office-based blood pressure measurements can be misleading. Two important phenomena are **white coat hypertension** and **masked hypertension**. White coat hypertension refers to the condition where a patient's blood pressure is elevated in the clinical setting but is normal during their daily activities. Masked hypertension is the inverse: office blood pressures are normal, but ambulatory pressures are elevated.

**Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM)**, which records blood pressure at regular intervals over a 24-hour period, is the gold standard for differentiating these conditions from true, sustained hypertension. ABPM provides 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime averages, which are compared to established thresholds (e.g., 24-hour mean $\geq 130/80$ $\mathrm{mmHg}$, daytime mean $\geq 135/85$ $\mathrm{mmHg}$, or nighttime mean $\geq 120/70$ $\mathrm{mmHg}$).

The value of ABPM can be illustrated with a hypothetical scenario. Consider a population of pregnant patients before 20 weeks' gestation where the true prevalence of chronic hypertension is $15\%$. If office BP measurements have a $25\%$ false-positive rate (white coat hypertension) among those without true hypertension and an $80\%$ true-positive rate (sensitivity) among those with true hypertension, the **[positive predictive value](@entry_id:190064) (PPV)** of an elevated office reading is only about $36\%$. This means that nearly two-thirds of patients with elevated office blood pressures would be normotensive on ABPM. This highlights how ABPM can prevent over-diagnosis and unnecessary treatment by identifying the large proportion of patients with white coat hypertension [@problem_id:4413801].

### Epidemiology of Chronic Hypertension in Pregnancy

The prevalence of chronic hypertension in pregnancy has been increasing, a trend that mirrors rising rates of maternal obesity and advanced maternal age. Data from surveillance studies indicate that the overall prevalence has more than doubled in recent decades, rising from approximately $2\%$ in the early 2000s to $5\%$ or higher in the 2020s.

There are strong, graded associations between chronic hypertension and several key demographic factors.
- **Maternal Age:** Risk increases significantly with age. The prevalence in pregnant individuals aged 35 years and older can be several times higher than in those under 25. For example, it is not uncommon to observe a prevalence of $12\%$ in the $\geq 35$ age group compared to $4\%$ in the $25–34$ age group and $2\%$ in those under $25$.
- **Body Mass Index (BMI):** Obesity is a major risk factor. The prevalence of chronic hypertension in pregnant individuals with obesity (BMI $\geq 30$ $\mathrm{kg/m^2}$) can be more than four times higher than in those with a normal BMI ($25$ $\mathrm{kg/m^2}$).
- **Race and Ethnicity:** Significant disparities exist. In the United States, for instance, the prevalence of chronic hypertension is consistently highest among non-Hispanic Black individuals, often double the rate seen in non-Hispanic White individuals, who in turn have a higher rate than Hispanic individuals. Epidemiologic analysis using age-standardization confirms that these disparities are not merely a reflection of differences in age distribution among the groups; rather, the disparity often persists or is even strengthened after adjusting for age, pointing to a complex interplay of genetic, social, and systemic factors [@problem_id:4413800].

### Pathophysiology: From Systemic Circulation to the Placental Interface

The clinical manifestations of chronic hypertension in pregnancy arise from the collision of pre-existing maternal cardiovascular pathology with the profound physiological demands of gestation.

#### Normal Cardiovascular Adaptations to Pregnancy

A healthy pregnancy is characterized by remarkable cardiovascular adaptations designed to support the growing uteroplacental unit. The most prominent change is a dramatic **systemic vasodilation**. This is mediated by a confluence of factors, including hormonal influences from progesterone and relaxin, and endothelial-derived vasodilators like **[nitric oxide](@entry_id:154957) (NO)** and **prostacyclin (PGI₂)**. Furthermore, the maternal vasculature becomes less sensitive to endogenous vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II. This vasodilation leads to a significant decrease in **[systemic vascular resistance](@entry_id:162787) (SVR)**, typically by $20\%$ to $30\%$, which reaches its lowest point during the second trimester.

In response to this reduced SVR (afterload) and a concurrent $30\%$ to $50\%$ expansion of plasma volume (which increases preload), **cardiac output (CO)** rises substantially, increasing by $30\%$ to $50\%$ above non-pregnant levels. This increase is achieved through elevations in both stroke volume and heart rate. The net effect is that despite a massive increase in blood flow, mean arterial pressure typically falls slightly in the first half of pregnancy before returning to near pre-pregnancy levels by term.

#### The Hypertensive State: A Blunting of Normal Adaptation

In a patient with chronic hypertension, these crucial adaptations are blunted. The pre-existing condition is often characterized by **endothelial dysfunction**, meaning the blood vessels have an impaired ability to produce vasodilators like NO. The arterial walls may exhibit increased stiffness and structural remodeling, and there is often a heightened sensitivity to vasoconstrictors.

Consequently, when the vasodilatory signals of pregnancy occur, the hypertensive vasculature is unable to respond fully. The fall in SVR is attenuated, and the typical mid-trimester dip in blood pressure may be absent. Similarly, long-standing hypertension can cause compensatory **left ventricular hypertrophy**, making the heart muscle thicker and stiffer. This diastolic dysfunction can limit the heart's ability to accommodate the increased preload from plasma volume expansion, thereby blunting the expected rise in stroke volume and cardiac output. The hypertensive cardiovascular system, therefore, fails to fully transform into the high-flow, low-resistance system required for an optimal pregnancy [@problem_id:4413767].

#### The Placental Nexus: Impaired Spiral Artery Remodeling

The most critical consequences of this blunted adaptation occur at the [maternal-fetal interface](@entry_id:183177). For the placenta to receive the massive blood flow it requires (approximately $500–700$ $\text{mL/min}$ at term), the maternal **spiral arteries** in the uterus must undergo extensive remodeling. In a normal pregnancy, invasive fetal cells known as **extravillous trophoblasts** migrate into the walls of these small arteries, destroying the muscular, vasoreactive layer and transforming them into wide, flaccid, low-resistance conduits.

In chronic hypertension, the underlying maternal arteriopathy and [endothelial dysfunction](@entry_id:154855) can severely impair this [trophoblast invasion](@entry_id:264958) and remodeling process. As a result, a significant portion of the spiral arteries may remain narrow, muscular, and capable of vasoconstriction. The physiological impact of this failure can be understood through the principles of fluid dynamics, specifically **Poiseuille's law**, which states that flow ($Q$) through a tube is proportional to the fourth power of its radius ($r$), i.e., $Q \propto r^4$.

This fourth-power relationship means that even small differences in vessel radius have enormous consequences for blood flow. For example, in a simplified model where chronic hypertension results in $40\%$ of spiral arteries failing to remodel to a radius half that of normal, the total uteroplacental blood flow can be reduced by $25\%$ or more, even if the maternal perfusion pressure is slightly higher. This state of chronically reduced and unstable placental blood supply is known as **maternal vascular malperfusion** and is the central pathological lesion that drives most of the adverse outcomes associated with chronic hypertension in pregnancy [@problem_id:4413816].

#### The Molecular Cascade to Superimposed Preeclampsia

The [endothelial dysfunction](@entry_id:154855) inherent to chronic hypertension also creates a state of heightened vulnerability to **superimposed preeclampsia**. The development of preeclampsia is driven by placental factors released in response to ischemia and hypoxia—conditions directly caused by the impaired [spiral artery remodeling](@entry_id:170815). A key factor released by the ischemic placenta is **soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1)**, an anti-angiogenic protein.

sFlt-1 acts by binding to and neutralizing circulating pro-angiogenic proteins essential for endothelial health, such as **Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)** and **Placental Growth Factor (PlGF)**. The [sequestration](@entry_id:271300) of VEGF and PlGF leads to widespread maternal endothelial injury. This injury further exacerbates the underlying imbalance of endothelial mediators seen in hypertension. The production of vasodilators (NO and PGI₂) is suppressed, while the production of vasoconstrictors like **endothelin-1 (ET-1)** and **thromboxane A₂ (TXA₂)** is increased.

This systemic shift towards vasoconstriction, platelet activation, and endothelial leakiness is the clinical syndrome of preeclampsia. It manifests as a sharp rise in blood pressure, proteinuria from glomerular endothelial damage, and other signs of end-organ dysfunction. Thus, chronic hypertension predisposes to superimposed preeclampsia through a "two-hit" mechanism: pre-existing [endothelial dysfunction](@entry_id:154855) (the first hit) is amplified by placental ischemia-induced anti-angiogenic factors (the second hit), creating a vicious cycle of worsening vasoconstriction and organ damage [@problem_id:4413831].

### Clinical Implications and Management Principles

The pathophysiology of chronic hypertension in pregnancy directly translates into a spectrum of risks for both the mother and the fetus. Evidence-based management strategies aim to mitigate these risks through prophylaxis and therapeutic intervention.

#### The Spectrum of Adverse Outcomes

Maternal vascular malperfusion and the consequent placental insufficiency are the direct causes of an increased risk of several major adverse perinatal outcomes. Compared to normotensive pregnancies, individuals with chronic hypertension face:
- **Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR):** A chronic deficit in the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus impairs growth, leading to an infant smaller than its genetic potential. The relative risk for FGR is approximately doubled in patients with uncomplicated chronic hypertension.
- **Preterm Birth:** Placental insufficiency can act as a chronic stressor, triggering spontaneous preterm labor. More commonly, worsening maternal hypertension, the development of superimposed preeclampsia, or evidence of fetal compromise necessitates a medically indicated (iatrogenic) preterm delivery. The risk of preterm birth before 37 weeks is also roughly doubled.
- **Placental Abruption:** The underlying decidual arteriopathy makes the small vessels at the placental interface fragile and prone to rupture, which can cause bleeding behind the placenta and premature separation from the uterine wall. The relative risk for abruption is increased, often by a factor of 2.5 or more.
- **Stillbirth:** The most devastating outcome, which can result from severe, chronic placental insufficiency or an acute catastrophic event like a major placental abruption. The risk, while low in absolute terms, is modestly but significantly increased, with a relative risk of approximately 1.5 to 2.0 [@problem_id:4413808].

#### Prophylaxis: The Role of Low-Dose Aspirin

Given the central role of placental dysfunction and the imbalance between thromboxane (a vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregator) and prostacyclin (a vasodilator and platelet inhibitor), a key preventative strategy is the use of **low-dose aspirin**. The rationale is based on the differential pharmacology of aspirin on platelets versus endothelial cells.

Low doses of aspirin (e.g., $81$ mg daily) irreversibly inhibit the **cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)** enzyme. Because platelets are anucleate, their COX-1 is permanently disabled for their entire lifespan, leading to a profound and sustained reduction in the synthesis of platelet-derived TXA₂. While aspirin also inhibits endothelial **cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)**, which produces PGI₂, endothelial cells are nucleated and can rapidly resynthesize the enzyme. The net effect of low-dose aspirin is a decisive shift in the TXA₂/PGI₂ balance towards vasodilation and anti-aggregation.

This modulation is thought to improve [trophoblast invasion](@entry_id:264958) and function, promoting better [spiral artery remodeling](@entry_id:170815) and protecting against the development of preeclampsia. Crucially, because this remodeling process is largely complete by 16-20 weeks, guidelines recommend initiating low-dose aspirin between **12 and 16 weeks of gestation** to have a meaningful impact on placentation [@problem_id:4413770].

#### Therapeutic Intervention: Evidence for Blood Pressure Control

For decades, there was uncertainty about whether to treat mild-to-moderate chronic hypertension in pregnancy, driven by fears that lowering maternal blood pressure could compromise uteroplacental perfusion and harm the fetus. This question was definitively answered by the **Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy (CHAP) trial**.

The CHAP trial was a large, multicenter randomized controlled trial that compared an "active treatment" strategy (initiating medication to keep BP $ 140/90$ $\mathrm{mmHg}$) with a "standard" strategy (reserving treatment for severe hypertension, BP $\geq 160/105$ $\mathrm{mmHg}$). The results were clear: active treatment led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the primary composite outcome of severe preeclampsia, medically indicated preterm birth before 35 weeks, placental abruption, or fetal/neonatal death (relative risk $\approx 0.82$). Importantly, this benefit was achieved **without** any increase in the risk of small-for-gestational-age infants (relative risk $\approx 1.07$, with a 95% confidence interval including 1.0).

The CHAP trial provides powerful, high-quality evidence that treating chronic hypertension to a target of $ 140/90$ $\mathrm{mmHg}$ improves pregnancy outcomes. It supports the physiologic principle that judiciously lowering sustained maternal hypertension reduces maternal vascular stress and the risk of placental ischemic events, while fetal perfusion is maintained within the autoregulatory range [@problem_id:4413805].
