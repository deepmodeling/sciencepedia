The given conditions are that the initial area is $A(0) = A_{0}$ and the area at $t=21$ days is $A(21) = 0.6A_{0}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the linear model.\nThe assumption for the linear model is that the rate of area loss is constant. This is expressed by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = C $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant. We can solve this equation by direct integration with respect to time $t$:\n$$ \\int_{A(0)}^{A(t)} dA' = \\int_{0}^{t} C dt' $$\nThis yields:\n$$ A(t) - A(0) = C(t - 0) $$\nUsing the initial condition $A(0) = A_{0}$, we obtain the expression for $A(t)$:\n$$ A(t) = A_{0} + Ct $$\nTo determine the constant $C$, we apply the boundary condition at $t=21$ days, $A(21) = 0.6A_{0}$:\n$$ A(21) = A_{0} + C(21) = 0.6A_{0} $$\nSolving for $C$:\n$$ 21C = 0.6A_{0} - A_{0} = -0.4A_{0} $$\n$$ C = -\\frac{0.4A_{0}}{21} $$\nThe problem defines the linear fractional reduction rate per day, $r_{L}$, as $r_{L} := \\frac{1}{A_{0}}\\left(-\\frac{dA}{dt}\\right)$.

It is a well-defined analytical task based on scientifically sound principles. The solution will proceed by systematically evaluating the patient's data against the given thresholds.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe overall involution trajectory is classified by evaluating the patient's data against the three specified sets of thresholds.\n\n1.  **Fundal Descent Analysis**:\n    The threshold requires the average daily descent, $\\bar{r}$, from day $t=2$ to day $t=10$ to be at least $0.8$ cm/day.\n    Using the provided data, $D(2)=1$ cm and $D(10)=9$ cm:\n    $$ \\bar{r} = \\frac{D(10)-D(2)}{10-2} = \\frac{9-1}{8} = \\frac{8}{8} = 1.0 \\text{ cm/day} $$\n    Comparing the calculated value to the threshold:\n    $$ 1.0 \\text{ cm/day} \\ge 0.8 \\text{ cm/day} $$\n    This condition is satisfied. The fundal descent rate is normal.\n\n2.  **Lochia Progression Analysis**:\n    The thresholds for lochia are evaluated sequentially.\n    - **Threshold 1**: \"Lochia rubra should not persist beyond day $5$.\" The patient data states that lochia rubra persists from days $1$–$9$. Since $9 > 5$, this threshold is **violated**.\n    - **Threshold 2**: \"Lochia serosa should appear by days $6$–$10$.\" The data indicates serosa appears at days $10$–$12$. As the appearance begins on day $10$, which is within the specified window, this threshold is met.\n    - **Threshold 3**: \"Lochia alba should be present from day $\\ge 10$ onward.\" The data indicates serosa is present on days $10$, $11$, and $12$, and alba is not present until day $14$. This means lochia alba is *not* present from day $10$ onward, violating this condition as well.\n    The most significant and clear violation is the persistence of lochia rubra. The lochia progression is abnormal.\n\n3.  **Uterine Volume Reduction Analysis**:\n    The thresholds are based on the ratio of uterine volume at a later time to the volume at day $t=2$. The baseline volume is $V(2) = 950$ mL.\n    - **Threshold at Day 7**: The condition is $V(7)/V(2) \\le 0.55$. The patient's data is $V(7)=500$ mL.\n      The ratio is:\n      $$ \\frac{V(7)}{V(2)} = \\frac{500}{950} = \\frac{50}{95} = \\frac{10}{19} \\approx 0.5263 $$\n      Comparing this to the threshold:\n      $$ 0.5263 \\le 0.55 $$\n      This condition is satisfied.\n    - **Threshold at Day 14**: The condition is $V(14)/V(2) \\le 0.35$. The patient's data is $V(14)=300$ mL.\n      The ratio is:\n      $$ \\frac{V(14)}{V(2)} = \\frac{300}{950} = \\frac{30}{95} = \\frac{6}{19} \\approx 0.3158 $$\n      Comparing this to the threshold:\n      $$ 0.3158 \\le 0.35 $$\n      This condition is also satisfied.\n    Both uterine volume reduction thresholds are met. The process is normal by this metric.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- Fundal descent: Normal.\n- Lochia progression: Abnormal (subinvolution).\n- Uterine volume reduction: Normal.\nSince one of the three primary criteria for normal involution is not met, the overall process is classified as subinvolution. The specific failure is the abnormal lochia progression, characterized by prolonged lochia rubra.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Normal involution; all thresholds are satisfied across fundal descent, lochia progression, and uterine volume reduction.**\nThis option claims all thresholds are satisfied. Our analysis shows that the lochia progression threshold (persistence of rubra) is violated. Therefore, the statement of normal involution is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Subinvolution; primary failure is persistent lochia rubra beyond day $5$ despite adequate fundal descent and uterine volume reductions.**\nThis option correctly identifies the overall condition as subinvolution because not all criteria for normalcy are met. It correctly pinpoints the \"primary failure\" as the persistent lochia rubra, which violated the rule that rubra should not persist beyond day $5$. It also correctly states that the other two measures—fundal descent and uterine volume reduction—were adequate, which aligns with our calculations.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Subinvolution; primary failure is insufficient uterine volume reduction by day $7$ (i.e., $V(7)/V(2)>0.55$).**\nThis option claims the uterine volume reduction by day $7$ was insufficient. Our calculation showed $V(7)/V(2) \\approx 0.526$, which is $\\le 0.55$. The volume reduction was adequate. Therefore, this option identifies the wrong primary failure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Subinvolution; primary failure is inadequate average fundal descent in the first $10$ days (i.e., $\\bar{r}<0.8$ centimeters per day).**\nThis option claims the average fundal descent was inadequate. Our calculation showed $\\bar{r}=1.0$ cm/day, which is $\\ge 0.8$ cm/day. The fundal descent was adequate. Therefore, this option identifies the wrong primary failure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4494721"}, {"introduction": "Building on kinetic theory and clinical assessment, this final practice elevates the analysis to a level characteristic of modern quantitative medicine.

This threshold corresponds to the common practice of identifying outliers as data points lying beyond the $95\\%$ confidence interval in a normal distribution.\n\nThe task is to process four test cases, each containing a series of time points $t_i$ with corresponding observed values $V_{\\mathrm{obs}}(t_i)$ and $E_{\\mathrm{obs}}(t_i)$. For each case, we must count the number of flagged deviations for volume ($n_V$) and for endometrial thickness ($n_E$).\n\nThe algorithmic procedure for a single observation $(t_i, V_{\\mathrm{obs}}(t_i), E_{\\mathrm{obs}}(t_i))$ is:\n$1$. Calculate $V_{\\mathrm{exp}}(t_i)$ and $E_{\\mathrm{exp}}(t_i)$ using the equations above.\n$2$. Calculate the residuals $z_{V,i} = (V_{\\mathrm{obs}}(t_i) - V_{\\mathrm{exp}}(t_i)) / \\sigma_V$ and $z_{E,i} = (E_{\\mathrm{obs}}(t_i) - E_{\\mathrm{exp}}(t_i)) / \\sigma_E$.\n$3$. If $\\lvert z_{V,i} \\rvert > 2$, increment a counter $n_V$.\n$4$. If $\\lvert z_{E,i} \\rvert > 2$, increment a counter $n_E$.\n\nThis procedure is applied to all data points within each case. The final result for each case is the pair of counts $[n_V, n_E]$.\n\nCase $1$: $t = [3.0, 7.0, 14.0, 28.0]$. All observed values fall well within $2$ standard deviations of the expected values. For example, at $t_1 = 7.0$ days, $V_{\\exp}(7.0) = 545.0 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^3$. The observed value is $V_{\\mathrm{obs}}(7.0) = 530.0 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^3$. The residual is $z_{V,1} = (530.0 - 545.0) / 70.0 = -0.214$. Since $\\lvert z_{V,1} \\rvert \\le 2$, it is not flagged. After processing all points, the counts are $n_V = 0$ and $n_E = 0$.\nResult: $[0, 0]$\n\nCase $2$: $t = [7.0, 14.0, 21.0, 35.0]$. The test data for volume are constructed such that the first three points have standardized residuals of exactly $\\pm 2.0$. For instance, at $t_1 = 7.0$ days, $V_{\\mathrm{obs}}(7.0) = 685.0 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^3$ and $V_{\\exp}(7.0) = 545.0 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^3$, leading to $z_{V,1} = (685.0 - 545.0) / 70.0 = 2.0$. Since the condition for flagging is a strict inequality, $\\lvert z \\rvert > 2$, none of these points are flagged. All endometrial thickness values also result in residuals with magnitudes less than or equal to $2$. The counts are $n_V = 0$ and $n_E = 0$.\nResult: $[0, 0]$\n\nCase $3$: $t = [3.0, 7.0, 14.0, 28.0]$. This case shows a pattern of subinvolution, where both volume and thickness are consistently and significantly larger than expected. For all four time points, the absolute standardized residuals for both $V$ and $E$ are calculated to be greater than $2.0$ (in fact, they are all approximately $3.0$). For example, at $t_2 = 7.0$ days, $V_{\\mathrm{obs}}(7.0) = 755.0 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^3$, leading to $z_{V,2} = (755.0 - 545.0) / 70.0 = 3.0$. This is flagged. All $4$ volume points and all $4$ thickness points are flagged. The counts are $n_V = 4$ and $n_E = 4$.\nResult: $[4, 4]$\n\nCase $4$: $t = [5.0, 6.0, 10.0, 42.0]$. This case presents a mixed pattern.\n- At $t_1 = 5.0$ days: $z_{V,1} \\approx -2.49$ and $z_{E,1} \\approx -2.16$. Both are flagged.\n- At $t_2 = 6.0$ days: $z_{V,2} \\approx 1.79$ and $z_{E,2} \\approx 0.49$. Neither is flagged.\n- At $t_3 = 10.0$ days: $z_{V,3} \\approx -0.0008$ and $z_{E,3} \\approx 1.93$. Neither is flagged.\n- At $t_4 = 42.0$ days: $z_{V,4} = 3.0$ and $z_{E,4} \\approx 0.0002$. The volume is flagged, but the thickness is not.\nIn total, there are $2$ flagged deviations for volume and $1$ for endometrial thickness. The counts are $n_V = 2$ and $n_E = 1$.\nResult: $[2, 1]$\n\nThe final compiled results for the four cases are $[[0, 0], [0, 0], [4, 4], [2, 1]]$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a first-order relaxation model to postpartum uterine involution data\n    to identify deviations beyond two standard deviations.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Model parameters for uterine volume (V)\n    V0 = 1000.0  # Initial volume in cm^3\n    V_inf = 90.0   # Baseline volume in cm^3\n    t_half_V = 7.0 # Half-life in days\n    sigma_V = 70.0 # Standard deviation in cm^3\n\n    # Model parameters for endometrial thickness (E)\n    E0 = 20.0    # Initial thickness in mm\n    E_inf = 3.0    # Baseline thickness in mm\n    t_half_E = 4.0 # Half-life in days\n    sigma_E = 1.5  # Standard deviation in mm\n    \n    # Calculate decay rate constants k = ln(2) / t_1/2\n    k_V = np.log(2) / t_half_V\n    k_E = np.log(2) / t_half_E\n    \n    # Define the test suite\n    # Each case is a tuple: (time_array, v_obs_array, e_obs_array)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1\n        (\n            np.array([3.0, 7.0, 14.0, 28.0]),\n            np.array([780.0, 530.0, 330.0, 160.0]),\n            np.array([13.5, 8.2, 4.3, 3.0])\n        ),\n        # Case 2\n        (\n            np.array([7.0, 14.0, 21.0, 35.0]),\n            np.array([685.0, 177.5, 343.75, 198.4375]),\n            np.array([10.5, 4.0, 3.2, 6.0])\n        ),\n        # Case 3\n        (\n            np.array([3.0, 7.0, 14.0, 28.0]),\n            np.array([976.41, 755.0, 527.5, 356.875]),\n            np.array([17.62, 12.544, 9.009, 7.632])\n        ),\n        # Case 4\n        (\n            np.array([5.0, 6.0, 10.0, 42.0]),\n            np.array([470.0, 718.0, 428.0, 314.21875]),\n            np.array([6.9, 9.75, 8.9, 3.012])\n        )\n    ]\n    \n    results = []\n    \n    for t_obs, V_obs, E_obs in test_cases:\n        # Calculate expected values using the model equation:\n        # Y_exp(t) = Y_inf + (Y0 - Y_inf) * exp(-k*t)\n        V_exp = V_inf + (V0 - V_inf) * np.exp(-k_V * t_obs)\n        E_exp = E_inf + (E0 - E_inf) * np.exp(-k_E * t_obs)\n        \n        # Calculate standardized residuals: z = (Y_obs - Y_exp) / sigma_Y\n        z_V = (V_obs - V_exp) / sigma_V\n        z_E = (E_obs - E_exp) / sigma_E\n        \n        # Count number of deviations where |z| > 2\n        n_V = np.sum(np.abs(z_V) > 2)\n        n_E = np.sum(np.abs(z_E) > 2)\n        \n        # Store the result for the current case\n        # Convert from numpy.int64 to standard python int for clean printing\n        results.append([int(n_V), int(n_E)])\n\n    # Format the output string to be exactly [[a,b],[c,d],...] with no spaces.\n    # str() of a list includes spaces, so they are removed.\n    output_str = str(results).replace(' ', '')\n    print(output_str)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "4494713"}]}
