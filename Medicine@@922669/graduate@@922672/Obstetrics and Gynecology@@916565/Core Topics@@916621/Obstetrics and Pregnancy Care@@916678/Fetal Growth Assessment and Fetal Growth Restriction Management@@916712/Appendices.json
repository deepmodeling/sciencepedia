A validated nomogram indicates that, at $32$ weeks $4$ days, the $95$th percentile value for the umbilical artery pulsatility index is $1.36$.

Express the computed pulsatility index as a unitless number and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Doppler velocimetry and its clinical application in obstetrics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary and consistent data for the calculation of the requested index. The values are physiologically plausible, and the clinical context is standard practice for the management of suspected fetal growth restriction.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the umbilical artery pulsatility index ($PI$) and interpret its clinical significance. The pulsatility index, a quantitative measure of vascular impedance downstream from the point of measurement, is defined by the formula:\n$$\nPI = \\frac{PSV - EDV}{TAMV}\n$$\nwhere $PSV$ is the peak systolic velocity, $EDV$ is the end-diastolic velocity, and $TAMV$ is the time-averaged mean velocity over the cardiac cycle.\n\nThe problem provides the following data, measured from the umbilical artery Doppler waveform:\n- Peak systolic velocity, $PSV = 42 \\, \\mathrm{cm \\cdot s^{-1}}$\n- End-diastolic velocity, $EDV = 9 \\, \\mathrm{cm \\cdot s^{-1}}$\n- Time-averaged mean velocity, $TAMV = 22 \\, \\mathrm{cm \\cdot s^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the definition for the $PI$:\n$$\nPI = \\frac{42 \\, \\mathrm{cm \\cdot s^{-1}} - 9 \\, \\mathrm{cm \\cdot s^{-1}}}{22 \\, \\mathrm{cm \\cdot s^{-1}}}\n$$\nThe units of velocity ($\\mathrm{cm \\cdot s^{-1}}$) in the numerator and denominator cancel, rendering the $PI$ a dimensionless quantity, as expected.\n$$\nPI = \\frac{33}{22} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the computed pulsatility index is $1.50$.\n\nThe next step is to compare this computed value to the provided normative threshold. The gestational age is $32$ weeks and $4$ days, for which the $95$th percentile value for the umbilical artery $PI$ is given as $1.36$.\n- Computed $PI = 1.50$\n- $95$th percentile threshold = $1.36$\n\nThe comparison yields $1.50 > 1.36$. This demonstrates that the measured umbilical artery $PI$ is abnormally elevated, as it exceeds the $95$th percentile for the specified gestational age.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the clinical management implication of this finding. An elevated umbilical artery $PI$ is indicative of increased vascular resistance in the placental circulation. This is a key pathophysiological finding in fetal growth restriction and is associated with an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. According to established, evidence-based guidelines for the management of suspected fetal growth restriction, the finding of an umbilical artery $PI > 95$th percentile is a critical determinant of fetal risk and mandates an increase in the intensity and frequency of fetal surveillance. Therefore, the surveillance plan should be escalated from routine (e.g., weekly) to more frequent monitoring. This typically involves bi-weekly (i.e., twice-weekly) fetal heart rate monitoring (non-stress tests) and/or biophysical profiles, along with serial follow-up Doppler assessments to detect any further deterioration, such as the progression to absent or reversed end-diastolic velocity, which would further heighten concern and potentially prompt intervention such as corticosteroid administration and delivery.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.50}$$", "id": "4438787"}, {"introduction": "In the face of placental insufficiency, a fetus may adapt by preferentially shunting oxygenated blood to the brain, a process known as the \"brain-sparing\" effect.

The problem is self-contained, consistent, and formalizable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution process follows the logic of the clinical management protocol provided.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the cerebroplacental ratio (CPR). The CPR is defined as the ratio of the MCA PI to the UA PI. This ratio reflects the redistribution of fetal blood flow, a key adaptation to placental insufficiency known as the \"brain-sparing\" effect.\nThe formula is:\n$$ \\text{CPR} = \\frac{\\text{MCA PI}}{\\text{UA PI}} $$\nUsing the provided values:\n$$ \\text{CPR} = \\frac{1.15}{1.05} $$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $100$:\n$$ \\text{CPR} = \\frac{115}{105} = \\frac{23 \\times 5}{21 \\times 5} = \\frac{23}{21} $$\nFor comparison purposes, we can evaluate this ratio numerically:\n$$ \\text{CPR} \\approx 1.095238... $$\n\nNext, we apply the provided decision-making framework to determine the recommended timing of delivery. The framework is based on two conditions: the UA PI value and the CPR value.\n\nCondition check for Rule 1: We must evaluate if either \"UA PI > 1.10\" or \"CPR  1.25\" is true.\n1.  Check the UA PI: The patient's UA PI is $1.05$. The threshold for the $95$th centile is given as $1.10$. Is $1.05 > 1.10$? This is false.\n2.  Check the CPR: The calculated CPR is $\\frac{23}{21} \\approx 1.095$. The threshold for the $10$th centile is given as $1.25$. Is $1.095  1.25$? This is true.\n\nThe logical condition for Rule 1 is a disjunction (an \"OR\" statement): (UA PI > 1.10) OR (CPR  1.25).\nSince the first part is false and the second part is true, the entire statement (False OR True) evaluates to True. Therefore, Rule 1 applies.\n\nAccording to Rule 1, the recommended timing of delivery is $37$ weeks $+0$ days.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the number of days between the current gestational age and the recommended delivery date.\n- Current gestational age: $36$ weeks $+2$ days.\n- Recommended delivery gestational age: $37$ weeks $+0$ days.\n\nTo find the interval in days, we can express both dates as a total number of days from the beginning of gestation (a week is defined as $7$ days).\n- Current age in days = $(36 \\times 7) + 2 = 252 + 2 = 254$ days.\n- Delivery age in days = $(37 \\times 7) + 0 = 259$ days.\n\nThe number of days from today until delivery is the difference between these two values:\n$$ \\text{Days until delivery} = (\\text{Delivery age in days}) - (\\text{Current age in days}) $$\n$$ \\text{Days until delivery} = 259 - 254 = 5 $$\nAlternatively, one can reason that the time difference is $(37 weeks - 36 weeks) + (0 days - 2 days)$. This equals $1$ week $- 2$ days, which is $7$ days $- 2$ days $= 5$ days.\n\nThe recommended delivery is in $5$ days.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "4438743"}, {"introduction": "Monochorionic twin pregnancies, which share a single placenta, carry unique risks, including the development of selective Fetal Growth Restriction (sFGR) where one twin fails to reach its growth potential.
