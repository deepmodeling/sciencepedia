A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to derive expressions for the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) and then calculate their numerical values.\n\nLet $S_e$ denote the sensitivity of the test, $S_p$ the specificity, and $P_v$ the prevalence.\nFrom the givens, we have:\n-   Sensitivity: $S_e = \\mathbb{P}(T^{+} \\mid D) = 0.85$\n-   Specificity: $S_p = \\mathbb{P}(T^{-} \\mid \\overline{D}) = 0.90$\n-   Prevalence: $P_v = \\mathbb{P}(D) = 0.03$\n\nFrom these definitions, we can derive other necessary probabilities:\n-   The probability of a false negative is $1 - S_e = \\mathbb{P}(T^{-} \\mid D) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n-   The probability of no disease is $\\mathbb{P}(\\overline{D}) = 1 - P_v = 1 - 0.03 = 0.97$.\n-   The probability of a false positive is $1 - S_p = \\mathbb{P}(T^{+} \\mid \\overline{D}) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\n**1.
