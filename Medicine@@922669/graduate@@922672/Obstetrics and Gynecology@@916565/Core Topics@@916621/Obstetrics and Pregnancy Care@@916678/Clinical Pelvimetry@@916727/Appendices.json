It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe pelvic inlet has several important anteroposterior diameters. The two relevant to this problem are the obstetric conjugate ($OC$) and the diagonal conjugate ($DC$).\n\n1.  **Geometric Definitions**:\n    - The **obstetric conjugate ($OC$)**, also known as the true conjugate, is the shortest anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic inlet. It extends from the sacral promontory to the most prominent point on the posterior-superior aspect of the pubic symphysis. This is the critical diameter through which the fetal head must pass. It cannot be measured directly in a clinical examination.\n    - The **diagonal conjugate ($DC$)** is the distance from the sacral promontory to the inferior margin of the pubic symphysis. This diameter can be measured clinically during a vaginal examination.\n\n2.  **Relationship between $OC$ and $DC$**:\n    The $DC$ is longer than the $OC$. The difference arises because the measurement point on the pubic symphysis is different (inferior margin for $DC$ vs. posterior-superior aspect for $OC$). The relationship depends on the height and angle of the pubic symphysis. In clinical practice, this geometric relationship is simplified into a linear subtraction. The problem statement codifies this simplification by defining a \"pubic symphysis thickness correction... along the axis of the conjugate.\"\n\n3.  **Derivation of the Expression**:\n    Let $c$ represent the pubic symphysis thickness correction. Based on the anatomical definitions, the diagonal conjugate spans a longer distance than the obstetric conjugate. The obstetric conjugate can therefore be estimated by subtracting the correction factor from the diagonal conjugate. The problem asks for this derivation based on the provided definitions.\n    \n    The relationship is thus expressed as:\n    $$OC = DC - c$$\n    This is the standard clinical approximation used to estimate the true conjugate from the measurable diagonal conjugate.\n\n4.  **Computation of the Obstetric Conjugate**:\n    The problem provides the following values:\n    - Diagonal conjugate, $DC = 11.5$ cm.\n    - Pubic symphysis thickness correction, $c = 1.5$ cm.\n\n    Substituting these values into the derived expression:\n    $$OC = 11.5 \\, \\text{cm} - 1.5 \\, \\text{cm}$$\n    $$OC = 10.0 \\, \\text{cm}$$\n\n    The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $10.0$ cm already contains three significant figures (the trailing zero is significant in this context of measurement and calculation).\n\n5.  **Comparison with Adequacy Thresholds**:\n    The computed obstetric conjugate is $OC = 10.0$ cm. This value is now compared to the provided clinical thresholds for a term vertex presentation.\n    - **Minimum Adequacy Threshold**: The minimum acceptable $OC$ is given as $10.0$ cm. The patient's computed $OC$ of $10.0$ cm meets this minimum requirement exactly. A pelvis with an $OC$ of $10.0$ cm is considered borderline adequate.\n    - **Typical Normal Threshold**: The typical range for a normal (uncontracted) pelvis is given as $OC \\geq 10.5$ cm. The patient's computed $OC$ of $10.0$ cm is less than $10.5$ cm. Therefore, the patient's pelvic inlet is smaller than typical.\n\n    In summary, the patient's pelvis is classified as borderline, meeting the absolute minimum dimension for a vaginal delivery of a term infant in a vertex presentation, but it is not considered spacious or typical.

The anteroposterior limiting diameter of the pelvic inlet, the obstetric conjugate (OC), is measured as $10.2$ centimeters, and the transverse diameter of the inlet at the widest usable level is measured as $9.9$ centimeters. The fetal head is in a well-flexed vertex attitude, so the engaging anteroposterior diameter of the head is the suboccipitobregmatic (SOB) diameter, known from standard anthropometric data to be approximately $9.5$ centimeters in term fetuses, while the biparietal diameter (BPD) is $9.8$ centimeters. Assume the following foundational facts:\n- The obstetric conjugate is the anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic inlet that the engaging fetal head must traverse in the anteroposterior direction.\n- The biparietal diameter is the maximal transverse diameter of the fetal head that must traverse the transverse capacity of the inlet.\n- Engagement feasibility requires simultaneous anteroposterior and transverse passage, which can be approximated by requiring nonnegative clearance along both orthogonal axes of the inlet. Define the axis-specific clearance as the inlet diameter minus the corresponding fetal head diameter along that axis.\n- Molding can reduce the biparietal diameter by up to $0.5$ centimeters, without increasing the suboccipitobregmatic diameter, and neglect additional soft tissue or caput effects beyond this molding.\n\nTreat the inlet and head as orthogonal-axis constraints (anteroposterior and transverse). Define the engagement clearance margin as the smaller of the two axis-specific clearances at the inlet plane. Under the assumption that the fetal head aligns such that the biparietal diameter projects onto the inlet’s transverse axis and the suboccipitobregmatic diameter projects onto the inlet’s anteroposterior axis, compute the maximal possible engagement clearance margin at the inlet when molding is allowed to reduce the biparietal diameter by up to $0.5$ centimeters.\n\nExpress the final clearance margin in centimeters. Round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The goal is to determine the maximal engagement clearance margin when molding can reduce the biparietal diameter (BPD) by up to $0.5$ centimeters. We proceed from the core definitions:\n\n1. The obstetric conjugate (OC) is the limiting anteroposterior pelvic inlet diameter. With a well-flexed vertex presentation, the engaging anteroposterior head diameter is the suboccipitobregmatic (SOB) diameter. Therefore, the anteroposterior clearance is\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{AP}} = \\mathrm{OC} - \\mathrm{SOB}.\n$$\n\n2. The transverse clearance is the inlet transverse diameter minus the effective transverse head diameter at the inlet. With molding, the BPD can be reduced by an amount $\\delta$, where $0 \\leq \\delta \\leq 0.5$. Thus, the transverse clearance becomes\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{T}}(\\delta) = T - (\\mathrm{BPD} - \\delta),\n$$\nwhere $T$ denotes the inlet transverse diameter.\n\n3. Engagement feasibility requires nonnegative clearance in both axes. The engagement clearance margin, as the limiting criterion at the inlet, is defined as\n$$\nm(\\delta) = \\min\\{c_{\\mathrm{AP}},\\, c_{\\mathrm{T}}(\\delta)\\}.\n$$\n\nWe wish to choose $\\delta \\in [0,0.5]$ to maximize $m(\\delta)$. Note that $c_{\\mathrm{AP}}$ is constant with respect to $\\delta$, and $c_{\\mathrm{T}}(\\delta)$ increases linearly with $\\delta$ (since molding reduces the BPD). The function $m(\\delta)$, being the minimum of a constant and an increasing function, is maximized by increasing $c_{\\mathrm{T}}(\\delta)$ until either it equals $c_{\\mathrm{AP}}$ or the maximum allowable $\\delta$ is reached.

A formal solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to calculate the post-test probability of obstructed labor given a positive pelvimetry finding, denoted as $P(D \\mid T+)$. The derivation will proceed from the fundamental definition of conditional probability.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient experiences obstructed labor, and let $D^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not experience obstructed labor. Let $T+$ be the event of a positive test result (indicating an inadequate pelvis) and $T-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe givens can be formally expressed in probabilistic terms:\n1.  The pretest probability, or prevalence, of obstructed labor is $P(D) = 0.20$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive result given the presence of the condition: $P(T+ \\mid D) = 0.70$.\n3.  The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative result given the absence of the condition: $P(T- \\mid D^c) = 0.80$.\n\nFrom these, we can deduce other necessary probabilities:\n- The probability of not having obstructed labor is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n- The probability of a positive test given the absence of the condition (the false positive rate) is $P(T+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(T- \\mid D^c) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$.\n\nThe post-test probability, $P(D \\mid T+)$, is the probability of having the condition given a positive test result. According to the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(D \\mid T+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T+)}{P(T+)}$$\nHere, $P(D \\cap T+)$ is the joint probability of having obstructed labor and testing positive. $P(T+)$ is the overall probability of testing positive, regardless of the true condition.\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, $P(D \\cap T+)$. We can rearrange the definition of conditional probability for sensitivity, $P(T+ \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T+)}{P(D)}$, to solve for the joint probability:\n$$P(D \\cap T+) = P(T+ \\mid D) \\times P(D)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(D \\cap T+) = 0.70 \\times 0.20 = 0.14$$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, $P(T+)$. A positive test result can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: a true positive (patient has the condition and tests positive) or a false positive (patient does not have the condition but tests positive). Using the law of total probability, we can express $P(T+)$ as the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:\n$$P(T+) = P(D \\cap T+) + P(D^c \\cap T+)$$\nWe have already calculated the first term, $P(D \\cap T+) = 0.14$. We now find the second term, $P(D^c \\cap T+)$, which is the joint probability of not having the condition and testing positive. Using the definition of conditional probability for the false positive rate:\n$$P(D^c \\cap T+) = P(T+ \\mid D^c) \\times P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the values we derived:\n$$P(D^c \\cap T+) = 0.20 \\times 0.80 = 0.16$$\nNow, we can calculate the total probability of a positive test:\n$$P(T+) = 0.14 + 0.16 = 0.30$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the values for the numerator and denominator back into the original formula for $P(D \\mid T+)$:\n$$P(D \\mid T+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T+)}{P(T+)} = \\frac{0.14}{0.30}$$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$$P(D \\mid T+) = \\frac{14}{30} = \\frac{7}{15}$$\nTo provide the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$P(D \\mid T+) = \\frac{7}{15} \\approx 0.46666...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.4667$.\n\nThis entire derivation from first principles is equivalent to applying Bayes' Theorem directly:\n$$P(D \\mid T+) = \\frac{P(T+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(T+ \\mid D^c) P(D^c)}$$\n$$P(D \\mid T+) = \\frac{0.70 \\times 0.20}{(0.70 \\times 0.20) + (0.20 \\times 0.80)} = \\frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.16} = \\frac{0.14}{0.30} \\approx 0.4667$$\nThe post-test probability of obstructed labor, given a positive pelvimetry finding, is $0.4667$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4667}$$", "id": "4415743"}]}
