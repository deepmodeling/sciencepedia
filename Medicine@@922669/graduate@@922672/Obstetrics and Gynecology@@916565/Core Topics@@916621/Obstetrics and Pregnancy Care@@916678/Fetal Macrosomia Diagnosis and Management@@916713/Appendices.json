The problem specifies a method using odds and likelihood ratios, which is a common formulation of the theorem in clinical epidemiology.\n\nLet $M$ be the event that the fetus is macrosomic.\nLet $T^{+}$ be the event of a positive test result (EFW exceeds the threshold).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- The pretest probability of macrosomia, $P(M) = 0.08$.\n- The positive likelihood ratio, $\\text{LR}^{+} = 6$.\n\nThe goal is to calculate the post-test probability of macrosomia given the positive test result, $P(M|T^{+})$.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three steps:\n1.  Convert the pretest probability to pretest odds.\n2.  Update the pretest odds to post-test odds using the likelihood ratio.\n3.  Convert the post-test odds back to a probability.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Pretest Odds**\nThe odds of an event are defined as the ratio of the probability that the event occurs to the probability that it does not occur. The pretest odds of macrosomia, $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}}$, are:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(M)}{1 - P(M)}\n$$\nSubstituting the given pretest probability:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{0.08}{1 - 0.08} = \\frac{0.08}{0.92}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Post-test Odds**\nThe relationship between pretest odds, post-test odds, and the likelihood ratio is:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} \\times \\text{LR}\n$$\nSince the test result is positive, we use the positive likelihood ratio, $\\text{LR}^{+}$.\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} \\times \\text{LR}^{+}\n$$\nSubstituting the values from Step 1 and the problem statement:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\left(\\frac{0.08}{0.92}\\right) \\times 6 = \\frac{0.48}{0.92}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Convert Post-test Odds to Post-test Probability**\nA probability can be recovered from odds using the formula:\n$$\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}}{1 + \\text{Odds}}\n$$\nThe post-test probability, $P(M|T^{+})$, is therefore:\n$$\nP(M|T^{+}) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}$:\n$$\nP(M|T^{+}) = \\frac{\\frac{0.48}{0.92}}{1 + \\frac{0.48}{0.92}}\n$$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $0.92$:\n$$\nP(M|T^{+}) = \\frac{0.48}{0.92 \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{0.48}{0.92}\\right)} = \\frac{0.48}{0.92 + 0.48} = \\frac{0.48}{1.40}\n$$\nThis fraction can be expressed in simpler terms:\n$$\nP(M|T^{+}) = \\frac{48}{140} = \\frac{12}{35}\n$$\nTo provide the final answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\nP(M|T^{+}) = \\frac{12}{35} \\approx 0.34285714...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures yields $0.3429$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3429}\n$$", "id": "4440019"}, {"introduction": "Ultrasound provides an Estimated Fetal Weight (EFW) as a continuous value, not just a binary positive or negative result.

The specified standard deviation of $12\\%$ for the fractional error is consistent with values reported in the relevant medical literature. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem asks for a conditional probability, $P(T \\geq 4500 | E = 4600)$, which suggests a Bayesian or fiducial inference approach. A full Bayesian analysis would require a prior distribution for the true weight $T$, which is not provided. However, the problem can be solved using a pivotal inference method, which is a common approach in applied statistics when a prior is not specified. In this method, the relationship between the data, the parameter, and a pivotal quantity with a known distribution is used to make probabilistic statements about the parameter. The problem can be re-expressed in terms of the random variable $\\varepsilon$, whose distribution is fully specified. This interpretation renders the problem well-posed and leads to a unique solution.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and quantitative language, free of subjective claims.\n4.  **Consistency and Completeness**: Under the pivotal inference interpretation, the problem is self-contained and free of contradictions.

It represents a valid and practical application of statistical reasoning in a clinical context.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to calculate the probability that the true fetal weight $T$ is greater than or equal to $4500$ g, given that the estimated fetal weight $E$ is $4600$ g. This is the conditional probability $P(T \\geq 4500 | E = 4600)$.\n\nThe relationship between the true weight $T$, the estimated weight $E$, and the fractional error $\\varepsilon$ is given by the model:\n$$E = T(1+\\varepsilon)$$\nWe are given that $\\varepsilon$ follows a normal distribution with a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $0.12$:\n$$\\varepsilon \\sim N(\\mu=0, \\sigma^2=0.12^2)$$\nWe are given the observed measurement $E = 4600$ g. We can rearrange the model equation to express the unknown true weight $T$ as a function of the measurement $E$ and the random error $\\varepsilon$:\n$$T = \\frac{E}{1+\\varepsilon}$$\nConditioning on the observation $E = 4600$ g, we have:\n$$T = \\frac{4600}{1+\\varepsilon}$$\nThis equation establishes a relationship between the unknown parameter $T$ and the random variable $\\varepsilon$. The uncertainty in $T$ is derived from the uncertainty in $\\varepsilon$. The condition on $T$, which is $T \\geq 4500$ g, can now be translated into an equivalent condition on $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\\frac{4600}{1+\\varepsilon} \\geq 4500$$\nFor this inequality to be manipulated, we must consider the sign of the term $(1+\\varepsilon)$. Since $T$ (true weight) and $E$ (estimated weight) are intrinsically positive quantities, the term $(1+\\varepsilon)$ must also be positive. The probability of $(1+\\varepsilon) \\leq 0$, or $\\varepsilon \\leq -1$, can be calculated. The z-score corresponding to $\\varepsilon = -1$ is $z = (-1 - 0) / 0.12 \\approx -8.33$. The probability $P(Z \\leq -8.33)$ is exceedingly small and can be considered negligible for all practical purposes. Therefore, we can safely assume $1+\\varepsilon  0$ and multiply both sides of the inequality by it without changing the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$4600 \\geq 4500(1+\\varepsilon)$$\n$$4600 \\geq 4500 + 4500\\varepsilon$$\nSubtracting $4500$ from both sides gives:\n$$100 \\geq 4500\\varepsilon$$\nDividing by $4500$ gives the condition on $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\\varepsilon \\leq \\frac{100}{4500} = \\frac{1}{45}$$\nThus, the probability $P(T \\geq 4500 | E = 4600)$ is equivalent to the probability $P(\\varepsilon \\leq \\frac{1}{45})$.\n\nTo compute this probability, we standardize the random variable $\\varepsilon$ by converting it to a standard normal variable $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$, using the formula:\n$$Z = \\frac{\\varepsilon - \\mu_{\\varepsilon}}{\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon - 0}{0.12} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{0.12}$$\nThe inequality $\\varepsilon \\leq \\frac{1}{45}$ is equivalent to:\n$$Z \\leq \\frac{1/45}{0.12}$$\nWe calculate the value of the upper bound for $Z$:\n$$\\frac{1/45}{0.12} = \\frac{1/45}{12/100} = \\frac{1}{45} \\times \\frac{100}{12} = \\frac{100}{540} = \\frac{10}{54} = \\frac{5}{27}$$\nSo, we need to calculate $P(Z \\leq \\frac{5}{27})$.

Using a standard normal CDF calculator or statistical software:\n$$\\Phi(0.185185...) \\approx 0.573453$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $5$, $7$, $3$, and $4$. The fifth digit is $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$0.5735$$\nTherefore, the probability that the true fetal weight is at least $4500$ g, given the ultrasound estimate of $4600$ g, is approximately $0.5735$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5735}$$", "id": "4440067"}, {"introduction": "Once the risk of macrosomia has been assessed, the focus shifts to management and evaluating the effectiveness of potential interventions.
