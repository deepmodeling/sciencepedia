Mastering this integrative reasoning is crucial for guiding timely, life-saving management decisions.

She is hemodynamically stable with blood pressure $118/72$ mmHg, pulse $82$ per minute, and no peritoneal signs. The initial quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is $1520 \\ \\mathrm{mIU/mL}$; a repeat $48$ hours later is $1600 \\ \\mathrm{mIU/mL}$. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) shows no intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) and reveals a $2.3 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$ solid-cystic adnexal mass with a hyperechoic ring adjacent to the right ovary, without yolk sac or fetal cardiac activity, and a small amount of free fluid in the cul-de-sac. Hemoglobin is $12.7 \\ \\mathrm{g/dL}$, creatinine is $0.8 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) $22 \\ \\mathrm{U/L}$, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) $18 \\ \\mathrm{U/L}$, and the patient denies alcohol use. She desires future fertility, is reliable for follow-up, and has no known medication contraindications.

The correct management is derived by synthesizing the patient's clinical presentation, serial human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels, and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) findings.\n\n### Analysis of Findings\n\n1.  **Diagnosis:** The combination of findings strongly supports a diagnosis of a right tubal ectopic pregnancy.\n    *   **hCG Trend:** The serum hCG level demonstrates a suboptimal rise, from $1520 \\ \\mathrm{mIU/mL}$ to $1600 \\ \\mathrm{mIU/mL}$ over $48$ hours. This represents an increase of only about $5.3\\%$, far below the minimum rise of at least $35-53\\%$ expected for a viable intrauterine pregnancy. This plateauing trend confirms a nonviable pregnancy.\n    *   **Ultrasound Findings:** The TVUS shows an empty uterus at an hCG level ($1520 \\ \\mathrm{mIU/mL}$) that is within the \"discriminatory zone,\" making an intrauterine pregnancy highly unlikely. Crucially, the ultrasound identifies a $2.3 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$ complex adnexal mass with a hyperechoic ring (the \"tubal ring sign\"), a specific sign for a tubal ectopic pregnancy.\n\n2.  **Assessment for Management:** The patient is hemodynamically stable, with no signs of rupture. The management options are expectant, medical (methotrexate), or surgical (laparoscopy).\n    *   **Expectant Management:** This is inappropriate. Expectant management is typically reserved for asymptomatic patients with low and spontaneously declining hCG levels. This patient is symptomatic, and her hCG is plateauing above $1500 \\ \\mathrm{mIU/mL}$, conferring a significant risk of tubal rupture.\n    *   **Surgical Management:** Immediate surgery is not required because the patient is stable. It is the treatment of choice for ruptured ectopics or for patients who are not candidates for medical management.\n    *   **Medical Management:** Methotrexate (MTX) is the first-line treatment for unruptured ectopic pregnancies in carefully selected patients.\n\n### Suitability for Methotrexate Therapy\n\nThe patient is an ideal candidate for medical management with single-dose methotrexate, based on established criteria:\n*   **Hemodynamic stability:** Yes.\n*   **No evidence of rupture:** Yes.\n*   **Desire to avoid surgery/preserve fertility:** Yes.\n*   **Reliable for follow-up:** Yes.\n*   **Ectopic size:** The mass is $2.3 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$, well below the relative contraindication threshold of $3.5-4 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\n*   **Fetal cardiac activity:** Absent.\n*   **Initial hCG level:** The hCG level of $1520 \\ \\mathrm{mIU/mL}$ is well below the relative contraindication of $5000 \\ \\mathrm{mIU/mL}$, predicting a high likelihood of success.\n*   **No contraindications to MTX:** The patient has normal renal (creatinine $0.8 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$) and liver (AST $22 \\ \\mathrm{U/L}$, ALT $18 \\ \\mathrm{U/L}$) function.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A. Expectant management...:** Incorrect. This approach is unsafe due to the high risk of rupture with a confirmed ectopic and a non-declining hCG.\n*   **B. Immediate single-dose methotrexate therapy...:** Correct. This option aligns perfectly with the diagnosis and the patient's clinical profile. She is an ideal candidate for medical management, which is effective and avoids the risks of surgery.\n*   **C. Diagnostic uterine aspiration...:** Incorrect. A uterine aspiration is used to differentiate an ectopic pregnancy from an intrauterine loss in a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL). Here, the location is no longer unknown; the ultrasound has identified an ectopic pregnancy. This procedure would be superfluous and would dangerously delay treatment.\n*   **D. Immediate diagnostic laparoscopy...:** Incorrect. Surgery is not the first-line treatment for a stable patient who is a good candidate for medical therapy.\n*   **E. Progesterone supplementation...:** Incorrect. This action is contraindicated. The pregnancy has been confirmed as nonviable (abnormal hCG rise) and very likely ectopic. Progesterone cannot salvage it and would delay definitive, life-saving treatment.\n\nFinally, because the patient is Rh-negative and has experienced a pregnancy event with bleeding, she requires Rh(D) immune globulin (RhIG) administration to prevent alloimmunization.

This problem is solved using Bayes' theorem, a fundamental principle of probability theory for updating beliefs based on evidence.\n\nLet us define the events and probabilities based on the provided data.\nLet $V$ be the event that the pregnancy is viable.\nLet $N$ be the event that the pregnancy is nonviable. These two events are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, so $P(N) = 1 - P(V)$.\nLet $T_P^+$ be the event of a \"positive\" serum progesterone test, defined as a concentration $\\geq 20$ ng/mL.\nLet $T_H^+$ be the event of a \"positive\" hCG trend test, defined as a 48-hour hCG ratio $\\geq 1.66$.\nLet $E$ be the event that both tests are positive, i.e., $E = T_P^+ \\cap T_H^+$.\n\nThe problem provides the following pre-test (prior) probability:\n$$P(V) = 0.40$$\nFrom this, we can deduce the prior probability of a nonviable pregnancy:\n$$P(N) = 1 - P(V) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$$\n\nThe problem also provides the conditional probabilities (operating characteristics) for each test.\nFor the progesterone test ($T_P$):\nThe sensitivity is $P(T_P^+ | V) = 0.85$.\nThe false positive rate is $P(T_P^+ | N) = 0.30$.\n\nFor the hCG trend test ($T_H$):\nThe sensitivity is $P(T_H^+ | V) = 0.72$.\nThe false positive rate is $P(T_H^+ | N) = 0.10$.\n\nThe patient's results (progesterone of $24$ ng/mL and hCG ratio of $1.75$) both meet the criteria for a positive result, so we are evaluating the probability of viability given the event $E$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the post-test (posterior) probability of viability, $P(V | E)$, which is $P(V | T_P^+ \\cap T_H^+)$. According to Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(V | E) = \\frac{P(E | V) P(V)}{P(E)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(E)$, is the total probability of the evidence, which is calculated using the law of total probability:\n$$P(E) = P(E | V) P(V) + P(E | N) P(N)$$\nSubstituting this into the Bayesian formula gives:\n$$P(V | E) = \\frac{P(E | V) P(V)}{P(E | V) P(V) + P(E | N) P(N)}$$\nThe key assumption stated in the problem is the conditional independence of the two tests given the viability status. This allows us to compute the joint conditional probabilities $P(E | V)$ and $P(E | N)$ as the product of the individual conditional probabilities:\n$$P(E | V) = P(T_P^+ \\cap T_H^+ | V) = P(T_P^+ | V) \\times P(T_H^+ | V)$$\n$$P(E | N) = P(T_P^+ \\cap T_H^+ | N) = P(T_P^+ | N) \\times P(T_H^+ | N)$$\nUsing the given values, we calculate these joint probabilities:\n$$P(E | V) = 0.85 \\times 0.72 = 0.612$$\n$$P(E | N) = 0.30 \\times 0.10 = 0.030$$\nNow, we substitute these values, along with the prior probabilities, into the full Bayesian equation:\n$$P(V | E) = \\frac{(0.612) \\times (0.40)}{(0.612) \\times (0.40) + (0.030) \\times (0.60)}$$\nWe proceed with the arithmetic calculation of the numerator and denominator.\nNumerator:\n$$0.612 \\times 0.40 = 0.2448$$\nDenominator:\n$$(0.612 \\times 0.40) + (0.030 \\times 0.60) = 0.2448 + 0.0180 = 0.2628$$\nThe final posterior probability is the ratio of these two values:\n$$P(V | E) = \\frac{0.2448}{0.2628}$$\n$$P(V | E) \\approx 0.931506849...$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.

The analysis proceeds by calculating the ARR for each trial, then pooling these results to find a single summary effect.\n\nLet $p_c$ be the risk of the event in the control group (misoprostol-only) and $p_i$ be the risk in the intervention group (combination therapy).
