The concepts of prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value are fundamental in medical statistics. The clinical context (GBS screening) and the numerical values provided are realistic.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data ($p$, $Se$, $Sp$) to calculate the requested quantity (Positive Predictive Value, PPV). The question is clear and leads to a single, unique, and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\nLet $C$ be the event that a patient is truly colonized with GBS. Let $T$ be the event that the screening assay returns a positive result. The complements, $C^c$ and $T^c$, represent the events of no colonization and a negative test, respectively.\n\nThe givens can be formally expressed as probabilities:\n- The prevalence of GBS colonization is $P(C) = p = 0.25$.\n- The probability of not being colonized is $P(C^c) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n- The sensitivity of the assay is the probability of a positive test given that the patient is colonized: $P(T \\mid C) = Se = 0.90$.\n- The specificity of the assay is the probability of a negative test given that the patient is not colonized: $P(T^c \\mid C^c) = Sp = 0.95$.\n\nThe quantity to be derived is the positive predictive value (PPV), which is the probability that a patient is truly colonized given that they have a positive test result. This is written as $P(C \\mid T)$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability (Bayes' rule):\n$$P(C \\mid T) = \\frac{P(C \\cap T)}{P(T)}$$\nThe term in the numerator, $P(C \\cap T)$, is the joint probability of being colonized and testing positive. It can be found by rearranging the definition of conditional probability $P(T \\mid C) = \\frac{P(C \\cap T)}{P(C)}$:\n$$P(C \\cap T) = P(T \\mid C) P(C) = Se \\cdot p$$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T)$, is the overall probability of a positive test. It can be found using the law of total probability, by considering the two mutually exclusive ways a positive test can occur: a true positive (patient is colonized and tests positive) and a false positive (patient is not colonized but tests positive).\n$$P(T) = P(T \\cap C) + P(T \\cap C^c)$$\nWe have already expressed the first term, $P(T \\cap C)$. The second term, $P(T \\cap C^c)$, is derived similarly:\n$$P(T \\cap C^c) = P(T \\mid C^c) P(C^c)$$\nHere, $P(T \\mid C^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given no colonization, which is the false positive rate. It is the complement of the specificity, $Sp = P(T^c \\mid C^c)$:\n$$P(T \\mid C^c) = 1 - P(T^c \\mid C^c) = 1 - Sp$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$P(T \\cap C^c) = (1 - Sp) P(C^c) = (1 - Sp)(1 - p)$$\nNow, we can write the full expression for $P(T)$:\n$$P(T) = P(T \\cap C) + P(T \\cap C^c) = (Se \\cdot p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)$$\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for the numerator and denominator back into the formula for $P(C \\mid T)$:\n$$P(C \\mid T) = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{(Se \\cdot p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}$$\nThis is the derived formula for the positive predictive value from first principles.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data: $p=0.25$, $Se=0.90$, and $Sp=0.95$.\n- Numerator: $Se \\cdot p = 0.90 \\times 0.25 = 0.225$.\n- Denominator: $(Se \\cdot p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p) = (0.90 \\times 0.25) + (1 - 0.95)(1 - 0.25)$.\n- Denominator: $0.225 + (0.05)(0.75) = 0.225 + 0.0375 = 0.2625$.\n\nSo, the PPV is:\n$$P(C \\mid T) = \\frac{0.225}{0.2625}$$\nThis fraction simplifies to $\\frac{6}{7}$. Converting to a decimal:\n$$\\frac{6}{7} \\approx 0.857142857...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.8571$.\n\n**Interpretation**\nA positive predictive value of $0.8571$ signifies that for a patient in this population who receives a positive GBS screening result at $36$–$37$ weeks' gestation, there is an $85.71\\%$ probability that she is truly colonized with GBS. In the context of intrapartum decision-making, this high PPV indicates that the test is a strong predictor of true GBS carrier status. Given the significant morbidity and mortality associated with early-onset neonatal GBS disease, and the relatively low risk of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), this level of certainty robustly supports the clinical guideline to administer IAP. Although there is a $1 - 0.8571 = 0.1429$ or $14.29\\%$ chance of a false positive (meaning the patient receives antibiotics unnecessarily), this is generally considered an acceptable trade-off to prevent the severe consequences of neonatal infection in the $85.71\\%$ of cases that are true positives.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.8571}\n$$", "id": "4447837"}, {"introduction": "Clinical practice rarely presents as textbook cases; often, multiple guidelines must be synthesized to manage a single patient.

A core principle is that IAP is indicated for GBS-colonized women once labor begins or membranes rupture. This patient is in early labor (regular contractions, cervical change). Therefore, the exception for planned cesarean delivery (which applies only *before* labor onset) is voided. GBS IAP is clearly indicated. The first-line agent is penicillin G, as she has no allergies.\n\n2.  **Indication for Surgical Site Infection (SSI) Prophylaxis:** The patient is undergoing a cesarean delivery. Standard SSI prophylaxis (e.g., cefazolin) is indicated for all cesarean deliveries to prevent maternal postoperative infection. This is a separate indication from GBS IAP.\n\n3.  **Timing of Delivery vs. IAP:** While achieving at least 4 hours of IAP is ideal for neonatal protection, clinical guidelines explicitly state that an indicated delivery should not be delayed solely to achieve this duration. The risks of delaying surgery (e.g., labor progression, increased surgical difficulty) outweigh the marginal benefit of completing the full 4-hour course. The correct approach is to start IAP immediately and proceed with the cesarean without delay.\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\n*   **A. Proceed directly to cesarean with standard surgical antibiotic prophylaxis only; no IAP is needed because the membranes are intact and cesarean is planned.** This is incorrect. The onset of labor is the key event that triggers the need for IAP in a GBS-colonized patient, regardless of membrane status.\n\n*   **B. Start penicillin G IAP and delay the cesarean until at least $4$ hours of IAP have elapsed to ensure neonatal protection.** This is incorrect. Delivery should not be delayed for the sole purpose of administering antibiotics.\n\n*   **C. Administer clindamycin IAP instead of penicillin because she is having a cesarean and the neonatal risk is low.** This is incorrect. Penicillin is the first-line agent. Clindamycin is reserved for patients with a high-risk penicillin allergy, which this patient does not have.\n\n*   **D. Proceed to cesarean without delay; administer standard surgical prophylaxis and initiate GBS-directed IAP with penicillin G (or ampicillin) immediately, without delaying surgery to achieve $4$ hours of IAP.** This is the correct approach. It addresses both the indication for GBS IAP (due to labor) and the separate indication for SSI prophylaxis, while adhering to the principle of not delaying an indicated surgery.\n\n*   **E. Withhold all antibiotics until membranes rupture or fever develops, then administer IAP.** This is incorrect and dangerous.
