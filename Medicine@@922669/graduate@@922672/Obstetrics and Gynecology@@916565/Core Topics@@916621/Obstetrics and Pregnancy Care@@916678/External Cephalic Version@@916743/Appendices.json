A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution requires calculating the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). This is the ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental effect of the \"attempt ECV\" strategy compared to the \"no ECV\" strategy. Let us denote the expected cost as $E[C]$ and the expected number of cesarean deliveries as $E[D]$.\n\n**Strategy 1: No ECV**\nUnder this strategy, the patient proceeds directly to a planned cesarean delivery.\n-   The expected cost is $E[C]_{\\text{no-ecv}} = C_{\\text{cs}}$.\n-   The expected number of cesarean deliveries is $E[D]_{\\text{no-ecv}} = 1$.\n\n**Strategy 2: Attempt ECV**\nThis strategy involves a probabilistic pathway. The cost of the ECV attempt, $C_{\\text{ecv}}$, is incurred at the outset.\n-   If ECV succeeds (with probability $p$), the delivery mode is either vaginal (with probability $1-q$) or cesarean (with probability $q$). The cost in this branch is $(1-q)C_{\\text{vd}} + qC_{\\text{cs}}$. The number of cesarean deliveries is $q$.\n-   If ECV fails (with probability $1-p$), the patient undergoes a planned cesarean delivery. The cost in this branch is $C_{\\text{cs}}$. The number of cesarean deliveries is $1$.\n\nThe total expected cost for the \"attempt ECV\" strategy is:\n$$E[C]_{\\text{ecv}} = C_{\\text{ecv}} + p \\cdot ((1-q)C_{\\text{vd}} + qC_{\\text{cs}}) + (1-p) \\cdot C_{\\text{cs}}$$\nSimplifying this expression:\n$$E[C]_{\\text{ecv}} = C_{\\text{ecv}} + p(1-q)C_{\\text{vd}} + pqC_{\\text{cs}} + C_{\\text{cs}} - pC_{\\text{cs}}$$\n$$E[C]_{\\text{ecv}} = C_{\\text{ecv}} + C_{\\text{cs}} + pC_{\\text{vd}} - pqC_{\\text{vd}} - pC_{\\text{cs}} + pqC_{\\text{cs}}$$\n$$E[C]_{\\text{ecv}} = C_{\\text{ecv}} + C_{\\text{cs}} + p(C_{\\text{vd}} - C_{\\text{cs}}) - pq(C_{\\text{vd}} - C_{\\text{cs}})$$\n$$E[C]_{\\text{ecv}} = C_{\\text{ecv}} + C_{\\text{cs}} - p(1-q)(C_{\\text{cs}} - C_{\\text{vd}})$$\n\nThe total expected number of cesarean deliveries for the \"attempt ECV\" strategy is:\n$$E[D]_{\\text{ecv}} = p \\cdot q + (1-p) \\cdot 1$$\n$$E[D]_{\\text{ecv}} = pq + 1 - p = 1 - p(1-q)$$\n\n**Incremental Cost and Incremental Effect**\nThe incremental cost, $\\Delta C$, is the difference in expected costs between the two strategies:\n$$\\Delta C = E[C]_{\\text{ecv}} - E[C]_{\\text{no-ecv}}$$\n$$\\Delta C = \\left(C_{\\text{ecv}} + C_{\\text{cs}} - p(1-q)(C_{\\text{cs}} - C_{\\text{vd}})\\right) - C_{\\text{cs}}$$\n$$\\Delta C = C_{\\text{ecv}} - p(1-q)(C_{\\text{cs}} - C_{\\text{vd}})$$\n\nThe effect is defined as the number of cesarean deliveries avoided. The incremental effect, $\\Delta E$, is the difference in the expected number of avoided cesareans.\nThe number of avoided cesareans for the \"no ECV\" strategy is $1 - E[D]_{\\text{no-ecv}} = 1 - 1 = 0$.\nThe number of avoided cesareans for the \"attempt ECV\" strategy is $1 - E[D]_{\\text{ecv}} = 1 - (1 - p(1-q)) = p(1-q)$.\nTherefore, the incremental effect is:\n$$\\Delta E = p(1-q) - 0 = p(1-q)$$\n\n**ICER Expression**\nThe ICER is the ratio of incremental cost to incremental effect, as a function of $p$:\n$$\\text{ICER}(p) = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{C_{\\text{ecv}} - p(1-q)(C_{\\text{cs}} - C_{\\text{vd}})}{p(1-q)}$$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$$\\text{ICER}(p) = \\frac{C_{\\text{ecv}}}{p(1-q)} - (C_{\\text{cs}} - C_{\\text{vd}})$$\nThis is the required dependence of the ICER on the ECV success probability $p$.\n\n**One-Way Sensitivity Analysis**\nWe are asked to compute the change in ICER as $p$ varies from $0.30$ to $0.70$.\nFirst, substitute the given numerical values:\n$C_{\\text{ecv}} = 1100$\n$C_{\\text{vd}} = 4600$\n$C_{\\text{cs}} = 7800$\n$q = 0.20$\n\nFrom these, we calculate the constants in the ICER formula:\n$1 - q = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$\n$C_{\\text{cs}} - C_{\\text{vd}} = 7800 - 4600 = 3200$\n\nThe specific ICER formula is:\n$$\\text{ICER}(p) = \\frac{1100}{p(0.80)} - 3200 = \\frac{1375}{p} - 3200$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the ICER at the endpoints of the specified range for $p$:\nFor $p = 0.70$:\n$$\\text{ICER}(0.70) = \\frac{1375}{0.70} - 3200$$\nFor $p = 0.30$:\n$$\\text{ICER}(0.30) = \\frac{1375}{0.30} - 3200$$\n\nThe problem asks for the change in the ICER, which is $\\text{ICER}(0.70) - \\text{ICER}(0.30)$:\n$$\\text{Change} = \\left(\\frac{1375}{0.70} - 3200\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1375}{0.30} - 3200\\right)$$\n$$\\text{Change} = \\frac{1375}{0.70} - \\frac{1375}{0.30}$$\n$$\\text{Change} = 1375 \\left(\\frac{1}{0.70} - \\frac{1}{0.30}\\right)$$\n$$\\text{Change} = 1375 \\left(\\frac{10}{7} - \\frac{10}{3}\\right)$$\n$$\\text{Change} = 1375 \\left(\\frac{30 - 70}{21}\\right)$$\n$$\\text{Change} = 1375 \\left(\\frac{-40}{21}\\right)$$\n$$\\text{Change} = -\\frac{55000}{21}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures.\n$$\\text{Change} \\approx -2619.047619...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $-2619$.
