## Introduction
The discovery of an adnexal mass during pregnancy presents a common yet complex clinical challenge, requiring a careful balance between maternal and fetal well-being. While most of these masses are benign and resolve spontaneously, the small but significant risk of malignancy, acute complications like torsion, and the unique physiological constraints of pregnancy demand a sophisticated and evidence-based approach. The primary problem for clinicians is accurately differentiating benign, transient structures from persistent or malignant pathology, and then determining the optimal management strategy—whether expectant or surgical—within a narrow therapeutic window.

This article provides a comprehensive framework for navigating this challenge. The first chapter, "Principles and Mechanisms," lays the foundation by exploring the hormonal and anatomical changes of pregnancy that influence the behavior of ovarian masses and confound traditional diagnostic markers. The second chapter, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," translates these principles into clinical practice, addressing advanced diagnostic techniques, management of acute complications, and the collaborative care required for suspected malignancies. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" offers interactive exercises to solidify your clinical reasoning and decision-making skills. Through this structured approach, you will gain the expertise to confidently evaluate and manage adnexal masses in pregnancy, ensuring the safest outcomes for both mother and child.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The evaluation and management of an adnexal mass discovered during pregnancy are predicated on a deep understanding of the unique physiological and anatomical context of gestation. Pregnancy profoundly alters the hormonal milieu, the natural history of ovarian structures, and the interpretation of diagnostic tests. Furthermore, it imposes critical constraints on the timing and technique of any potential surgical intervention. This chapter elucidates the core principles and mechanisms that govern the behavior of adnexal masses in pregnancy, providing a framework for evidence-based clinical reasoning.

### The Ovarian Environment in Pregnancy: A State of Quiescence and Support

The ovary's function is dramatically repurposed during pregnancy. In a non-pregnant cycle, the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis drives [follicular development](@entry_id:272075) and ovulation. In pregnancy, this axis is suppressed, creating a state of ovarian quiescence dedicated to supporting the early gestation.

The cornerstone of this transformation is the hormone **human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)**, produced by the syncytiotrophoblast of the developing placenta. HCG is structurally similar to luteinizing hormone (LH) and binds to LH receptors on the corpus luteum, the remnant of the ovulated follicle. This binding "rescues" the [corpus luteum](@entry_id:150308) from its programmed involution, stimulating it to produce vast quantities of **progesterone**. This progesterone is indispensable for maintaining the early pregnancy by promoting uterine quiescence, ensuring a receptive and nourishing decidual lining, and modulating the maternal immune system.

This intense hormonal stimulation by hCG can cause the corpus luteum to become enlarged and cystic, forming a **corpus luteum cyst**. Concurrently, the high levels of progesterone and estrogen produced by the hCG-stimulated corpus luteum exert strong negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. This feedback suppresses the secretion of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH), Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH), and LH. The resulting low levels of FSH and LH prevent the recruitment and development of new ovarian follicles, rendering the pregnant state anovulatory. This explains why the formation of new functional follicular cysts is rare during pregnancy [@problem_id:4399593].

A critical event in the first trimester is the **luteal-placental shift**. While the [corpus luteum](@entry_id:150308) is the primary source of progesterone for the first several weeks, the placenta gradually develops its own steroidogenic capacity. By approximately 7 to 9 weeks of gestation, placental progesterone production becomes significant, and by 10 to 12 weeks, the placenta has fully taken over as the dominant source of progesterone, rendering the corpus luteum redundant. This transition has two major consequences. First, as the trophic support from hCG wanes after its peak at 8-10 weeks, the now-unnecessary corpus luteum begins to [involute](@entry_id:269765) and typically regresses by the end of the first or early second trimester. Second, this timeline dictates clinical practice: if surgical removal of the [corpus luteum](@entry_id:150308) (e.g., via oophorectomy for torsion) is necessary before this shift is complete, exogenous progesterone support is mandatory to prevent pregnancy loss [@problem_id:4399569].

### Classification and Natural History of Adnexal Masses

An **adnexal mass** is any lesion arising from the ovary, fallopian tube, or adjacent paraovarian tissues. In pregnancy, these masses can be broadly divided into two categories: physiologic (or functional) and pathologic.

Physiologic masses are a direct consequence of the hormonal environment of pregnancy. They are extremely common, constituting the majority (approximately 60-80%) of adnexal masses detected in the first trimester. A key feature is their transient nature, with most resolving spontaneously. Pathologic masses, in contrast, are typically neoplastic or structural abnormalities that are incidental to the pregnancy. They are less common and, critically, they persist throughout gestation as they lack a physiological mechanism for resolution [@problem_id:4399565].

#### Physiologic (Functional) Masses

The most common functional masses are corpus luteum cysts and theca lutein cysts.

A **corpus luteum cyst** is the quintessential adnexal mass of early pregnancy. It typically appears on ultrasound as a simple or hemorrhagic cyst, often less than 5 cm in diameter, with a characteristic thick, crenulated wall and robust peripheral vascularity on color Doppler imaging, often described as a "ring of fire". This appearance reflects its high metabolic activity and vascular supply. In keeping with its physiological role, a [corpus luteum](@entry_id:150308) cyst is expected to regress by 14-16 weeks of gestation following the luteal-placental shift [@problem_id:4399546].

**Theca lutein cysts** are a less common type of functional mass resulting from ovarian hyperstimulation by pathologically high levels of hCG. They classically present as bilaterally enlarged ovaries containing multiple, large, thin-walled, multilocular cysts, sometimes arranged in a "spoke-wheel" configuration. These are most frequently associated with conditions of extreme hCG production, such as complete hydatidiform moles or multiple gestations [@problem_id:4399546]. The pathophysiology is a direct, exaggerated ovarian response to hCG stimulation of LH receptors. This must be distinguished from **Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)**, an iatrogenic condition seen in [assisted reproductive technology](@entry_id:199569). While both involve ovarian enlargement from hCG stimulation, OHSS is a systemic capillary leak syndrome driven by the ovarian secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leading to profound third-spacing of fluid (ascites, pleural effusions) and hemoconcentration, which are characteristically absent in cases of pure theca lutein cysts [@problem_id:4399579].

#### Pathologic Masses

Pathologic masses are persistent and their presence is unrelated to pregnancy physiology. The most common benign neoplasm diagnosed in pregnancy is the **mature cystic [teratoma](@entry_id:267435)**, also known as a dermoid cyst. On ultrasound, these often present as complex masses with highly echogenic components (sebaceous material and hair), posterior acoustic shadowing, and sometimes calcifications representing bone or teeth [@problem_id:4399546]. Other pathologic masses include benign cystadenomas, borderline tumors, and invasive malignancies. Nonovarian masses, such as **paraovarian cysts** arising from embryonic remnants in the broad ligament, may also be encountered and are identified by their clear separation from a normal-appearing ovary [@problem_id:4399546].

### Principles of Evaluation and Diagnostic Challenges

The primary goal of evaluation is to distinguish benign from malignant masses to guide management. While most masses are benign, the possibility of malignancy (approximately 1-8 cases per 10,000 pregnancies) necessitates a rigorous approach.

#### Interpreting Sonographic Features

Transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasound is the cornerstone of evaluation. While most functional cysts have a reassuring simple appearance, certain features raise suspicion for malignancy and warrant further investigation or consultation. These include large size ($>5-6$ cm), the presence of solid components, thick or irregular septations, and especially the presence of **papillary projections with internal vascular flow** on color Doppler. Associated findings such as ascites or peritoneal nodules further increase the index of suspicion for a malignant process [@problem_id:4399546].

#### Biomarkers: The CA-125 Pitfall

In non-pregnant individuals, the tumor marker **Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125)** is a useful adjunct in the evaluation of adnexal masses. However, in pregnancy, its utility is severely limited. CA-125 (the MUC16 glycoprotein) is not exclusive to ovarian cancer; it is also produced by the decidualized endometrium. The intense tissue remodeling associated with implantation and decidualization in the first trimester leads to a physiological, and often marked, elevation in serum CA-125 levels, typically peaking around 8-12 weeks. Therefore, an elevated CA-125, such as a value of $85$ U/mL in a patient at 10 weeks gestation, is non-specific and cannot reliably distinguish a benign process from malignancy [@problem_id:4399573]. CA-125 levels typically decline during the second and third trimesters, but its low specificity throughout pregnancy means that imaging characteristics remain the primary determinant for risk stratification.

#### Advanced Imaging and a Key Malignancy Mimic: The Decidualized Endometrioma

When ultrasound findings are equivocal, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) without gadolinium contrast is the preferred secondary imaging modality. MRI provides superior soft tissue characterization and can be pivotal in solving diagnostic dilemmas.

One of the most significant diagnostic challenges in pregnancy is the **decidualized endometrioma**. A pre-existing endometrioma (a cyst containing old blood from ectopic endometrial tissue) can undergo dramatic changes under the influence of high progesterone levels. The endometrial stromal lining of the cyst can undergo a florid decidual reaction, forming vascularized, solid-appearing nodules or papillary projections. On ultrasound, this can perfectly mimic an ovarian malignancy, presenting as a complex mass with solid components and internal blood flow [@problem_id:4399566].

MRI is invaluable in making the correct diagnosis. The key distinguishing features are:
1.  **Nodule Signal Intensity**: The mural nodules, being composed of decidual tissue, will exhibit a T2-weighted signal intensity that is **isointense to the native decidua** of the gravid uterus. This is a highly specific sign.
2.  **Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI)**: Malignant tumors are typically hypercellular, which restricts the random motion of water molecules, resulting in a low **Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC)**. Decidualized tissue is less cellular, allowing for more water motion and thus exhibiting a significantly **higher ADC value** (e.g., $>1.2 \times 10^{-3} \text{ mm}^2/\text{s}$).

Recognizing these features can prevent unnecessary and potentially morbid surgery for a benign, hormonally-driven phenomenon [@problem_id:4399566].

### Principles of Management and Surgical Intervention

Management is tailored to the mass's appearance, size, symptoms, and gestational age. Asymptomatic, simple cysts are typically managed expectantly with serial ultrasound. Surgical intervention is reserved for acute complications, persistent symptoms, or high suspicion of malignancy.

#### Acute Complications: Ovarian Torsion

Pregnancy significantly increases the risk of ovarian torsion, particularly in the presence of a moderately sized ($5-10$ cm) adnexal mass. The mechanism is a "perfect storm" of anatomical and physiological changes. First, as the uterus grows and ascends out of the bony pelvis around 12-14 weeks, it lifts the adnexa into the more spacious abdominal cavity, increasing their mobility. Second, high progesterone levels cause systemic ligamentous laxity, elongating the ovarian pedicle (the utero-ovarian and infundibulopelvic ligaments) and reducing its resistance to twisting. This creates a highly mobile mass with a large moment of inertia, suspended by a long, compliant stalk. Normal maternal movements, such as rolling over in bed, can then generate sufficient torque to cause the pedicle to twist upon itself, leading to vascular occlusion and ischemia [@problem_id:4399588].

#### Principles of Surgical Management

When surgery is indicated, both the timing and the technique must be carefully considered to minimize maternal and fetal risk.

**Optimal Timing**: The ideal window for elective adnexal surgery is the **early-to-mid second trimester (approximately 14-20 weeks' gestation)**. This timing represents a carefully considered compromise. Performing surgery after the first trimester avoids the period of [organogenesis](@entry_id:145155) and the period of highest baseline risk for spontaneous abortion. Delaying surgery beyond 20 weeks is also undesirable, as the enlarging uterus begins to significantly compromise surgical access and increases the risk of uterine injury. The second trimester is therefore the "sweet spot" that balances fetal safety with surgical feasibility [@problem_id:4399560].

**Surgical Approach**: **Laparoscopy** is generally the preferred approach over laparotomy for most benign-appearing masses. Its minimally invasive nature affords several key advantages in pregnancy, including less postoperative pain, reduced opioid requirement, faster recovery, and critically, less manipulation of the gravid uterus, which may reduce the risk of inciting preterm contractions [@problem_id:4399587].

**Anesthetic and Surgical Physiology**: The creation of a carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopy presents unique physiological challenges. The increased intra-abdominal pressure can compress the inferior vena cava, impeding venous return to the heart, which can decrease cardiac output and consequently reduce uteroplacental perfusion. Furthermore, $CO_2$ is absorbed from the peritoneum into the maternal bloodstream. Because $CO_2$ readily crosses the placenta, maternal [hypercapnia](@entry_id:156053) (an excess of $CO_2$) can overwhelm the fetal-to-maternal $CO_2$ gradient, leading to fetal [respiratory acidosis](@entry_id:156771). To mitigate these risks, insufflation pressures are judiciously limited to **$\leq 12$ mmHg**. This pressure is a compromise that provides adequate surgical visualization while minimizing the adverse hemodynamic and respiratory effects, thereby protecting both maternal and fetal well-being [@problem_id:4399587].
