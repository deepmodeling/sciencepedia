Well-tested clinical guidance recommends weight-adjusted cefazolin at higher body mass to achieve adequate tissue concentrations above the pathogen minimal inhibitory concentration, and the addition of azithromycin when cesarean delivery occurs after labor or rupture of membranes.\n\nUse the following foundational facts:\n- Volume of distribution and tissue antibiotic concentrations scale with body mass, so weight-based dosing is employed to achieve target pharmacodynamic exposure.\n- Widely accepted obstetric antibiotic prophylaxis guidance indicates cefazolin 3 g intravenously (IV) when maternal weight is $\\geq 120\\ \\text{kg}$ and azithromycin 500 mg IV is added for intrapartum cesarean or ruptured membranes.\n\nThe patient’s weight is 130 kg and body mass index (BMI) is 42.\n\nStarting from mass-balance principles for dose per kilogram, compute the cefazolin dose per kilogram that this patient will receive under the recommended regimen.
