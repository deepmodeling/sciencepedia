Using Bayes' theorem as a first principle:\n$$PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result, found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence, we get:\n$$P(T^+) = (S_e)(p) + (1-S_p)(1-p)$$\nTherefore, the expression for $PPV$ in terms of the given parameters is:\n$$PPV = \\frac{S_e \\cdot p}{S_e \\cdot p + (1-S_p)(1-p)}$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.99)(0.01)}{(0.99)(0.01) + (1-0.995)(1-0.01)} = \\frac{0.0099}{0.0099 + (0.005)(0.99)} = \\frac{0.0099}{0.0099 + 0.00495} = \\frac{0.0099}{0.01485}$$\n$$PPV = 0.66666... \\approx 0.6667$$\n\n**Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\nThe Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$) is the posterior probability that a patient does not have the disease given a negative test result, i.e., $P(D^c|T^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test result, found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- \\cap D^c) + P(T^- \\cap D) = P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c) + P(T^-|D)P(D)$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$P(T^-) = (S_p)(1-p) + (1-S_e)(p)$$\nTherefore, the expression for $NPV$ in terms of the given parameters is:\n$$NPV = \\frac{S_p (1-p)}{S_p (1-p) + (1-S_e)p}$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values:\n$$NPV = \\frac{(0.995)(1-0.01)}{(0.995)(1-0.01) + (1-0.99)(0.01)} = \\frac{(0.995)(0.99)}{0.98505 + (0.01)(0.01)} = \\frac{0.98505}{0.98505 + 0.0001} = \\frac{0.98505}{0.98515}$$\n$$NPV = 0.999898... \\approx 0.9999$$\n\n### Counseling Implications\nThe calculated posterior probabilities form the basis for patient counseling.\n1.  **Interpretation of a Reactive (Positive) Screening Result**: The $PPV$ is $0.6667$. This means that for a pregnant patient with a reactive screening result in this population, there is a $66.7\\%$ probability that she is truly HIV-positive and a $33.3\\%$ probability ($1 - PPV$) that the result is a false positive. It is critical to communicate that a reactive screening test is not a definitive diagnosis but an indicator of high risk that requires confirmation. The term \"reactive\" is often preferred over \"positive\" in initial counseling to emphasize this distinction.\n\n2.  **Role of Immediate Supplemental Testing**: Given the substantial probability ($1$ in $3$) of a false positive, immediate supplemental (confirmatory) testing is mandatory. Guidelines recommend a testing algorithm, often involving an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay. If results are indeterminate, an HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT) is performed. The patient must be informed that a final diagnosis hinges on the results of these more specific tests.\n\n3.  **Risk-Reduction Counseling Pending Confirmation**: While awaiting confirmatory results, the patient should be managed as if she has a true HIV infection (a \"presumptive positive\" status). This is a safety-critical measure to minimize the risk of perinatal (mother-to-child) and sexual transmission. Counseling should include:\n    -   **Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**: Immediate initiation of a combination ART regimen is recommended to reduce maternal viral load, which is the primary determinant of perinatal transmission risk. The benefits of rapidly suppressing the virus if the infection is real far outweigh the risks of a short course of ART if the confirmatory test is negative.\n    -   **Infant Feeding Plan**: The patient should be counseled on infant feeding options. In settings where safe and affordable alternatives are available, breastfeeding is typically avoided to eliminate this route of transmission.\n    -   **Partner Notification and Testing**: The patient should be counseled on the importance of informing her sexual partner(s), who should also be recommended for HIV testing.\n    -   **Safe Sexual Practices**: The use of condoms should be advised to prevent sexual transmission to partners.\n\nThis strategy, while potentially causing anxiety, is justified by the public health and individual imperative to prevent new HIV infections, especially perinatal transmission. The extremely high $NPV$ of $0.9999$ also provides strong reassurance for patients with a non-reactive (negative) result, meaning there is an exceptionally low probability of a missed infection.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.6667 & 0.9999 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4510574"}, {"introduction": "Universal screening programs are powerful public health tools, but they inevitably generate false positive results.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary objective is to calculate the expected number of false positive results in a cohort of $1{,}000$ individuals. A false positive occurs when an individual who is not infected tests positive.\n\nLet $I$ denote the event that a randomly selected individual has a chronic HCV infection, and let $N$ denote the event that the individual does not have the infection. The event $N$ is the complement of $I$.\nLet $T^+$ denote the event of a positive test result from the antibody assay, and $T^-$ denote the event of a negative test result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the prevalence of the infection:\n$$ \\Pr(I) = 0.006 $$\nThe probability that a randomly selected individual does not have the infection is the complement of the prevalence:\n$$ \\Pr(N) = 1 - \\Pr(I) = 1 - 0.006 = 0.994 $$\nWe are also given the specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test result given that the individual is not infected:\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = \\Pr(T^- \\mid N) = 0.98 $$\nThe probability of a positive test result given that the individual is not infected, $\\Pr(T^+ \\mid N)$, is known as the false positive rate. Since an individual either tests positive or negative, this probability is the complement of the specificity:\n$$ \\Pr(T^+ \\mid N) = 1 - \\Pr(T^- \\mid N) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02 $$\nA false positive result for a single test corresponds to the joint event that an individual is not infected ($N$) AND tests positive ($T^+$). The probability of this joint event, $\\Pr(T^+ \\cap N)$, can be found using the definition of conditional probability, $\\Pr(A \\cap B) = \\Pr(A \\mid B) \\Pr(B)$:\n$$ \\Pr(T^+ \\cap N) = \\Pr(T^+ \\mid N) \\times \\Pr(N) $$\nSubstituting the values we have derived:\n$$ \\Pr(T^+ \\cap N) = 0.02 \\times 0.994 = 0.01988 $$\nThis value, $0.01988$, represents the probability that any single, randomly selected individual from this population will be a false positive.\n\nThe problem states that $1{,}000$ independent tests are conducted. The number of false positives can be modeled as a random variable following a binomial distribution, where the number of trials is $n = 1{,}000$ and the probability of success (a false positive) in any given trial is $p = \\Pr(T^+ \\cap N) = 0.01988$.\n\nThe expected value, $E[X]$, of a binomially distributed random variable $X \\sim B(n, p)$ is given by the product $n \\times p$. Therefore, the expected number of false positives, $E[FP]$, in the cohort of $1{,}000$ tests is:\n$$ E[FP] = 1{,}000 \\times \\Pr(T^+ \\cap N) $$\n$$ E[FP] = 1{,}000 \\times 0.01988 = 19.88 $$\n\n### Proposed Confirmatory Pathway\n\nTo minimize misclassification, specifically to reduce the number of individuals falsely labeled as infected, a two-step reflex testing strategy is proposed.\n\n1.  **Pathway:** All samples that are reactive (positive) on the initial anti-HCV antibody immunoassay will automatically undergo a second, more specific confirmatory test: a Hepatitis C Virus Nucleic Acid Test (NAT).\n2.  **Final Classification:** An individual is given a final classification of \"infected\" with chronic HCV only if **both** the initial antibody assay and the subsequent NAT are positive. If the initial antibody test is positive but the reflex NAT is negative, the individual is classified as \"not currently infected\". This result may indicate a past, resolved HCV infection, or it may confirm that the initial antibody test was a biological false positive. Individuals who test negative on the initial antibody screen are classified as \"not infected\" and require no further testing.\n3.  **Key Test Characteristic Dependencies:** The overall diagnostic accuracy of this sequential algorithm is a function of the performance characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) of **both** tests. The final number of true positives depends on the product of the sensitivities of the antibody test and the NAT (for those with the infection). The final number of false positives depends on the specificities of both tests. An uninfected person is correctly classified if they test negative on the first test, OR if they test positive on the first and negative on the second. The probability of this is $\\Pr(T^-_{Ab} \\mid N) + \\Pr(T^+_{Ab} \\cap T^-_{NAT} \\mid N)$.\n4.  **Independence Assumption:** The calculation of the probability of a final false positive in this two-step pathway, $\\Pr(T^+_{Ab} \\cap T^+_{NAT} \\mid N)$, requires an assumption of conditional independence. This assumption states that for an uninfected individual (condition $N$), the outcome of the NAT is independent of the outcome of the antibody test. Formally: $\\Pr(T^+_{NAT} \\mid N, T^+_{Ab}) = \\Pr(T^+_{NAT} \\mid N)$. This allows one to multiply the individual false positive rates of the two tests: $\\Pr(T^+_{Ab} \\cap T^+_{NAT} \\mid N) = \\Pr(T^+_{Ab} \\mid N) \\times \\Pr(T^+_{NAT} \\mid N)$. This assumption is standard for modeling but may not be perfectly true biologically, as some underlying factors in a patient sample might predispose it to false reactivity on multiple assay types.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{19.88}\n$$", "id": "4510564"}, {"introduction": "Estimating the public health burden of a disease is essential for planning and resource allocation. This problem challenges you to build a model for perinatal Hepatitis C transmission by integrating multiple risk factors using the law of total probability.

Use the following foundational definitions and facts: (i) vertical transmission of HCV arises overwhelmingly from mothers with detectable maternal HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) viremia, (ii) the probability of transmission per birth is a conditional risk that depends on coinfection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and (iii) expected counts over a cohort are obtained by multiplying the per-birth probability by the number of births, based on the linearity of expectation and independence across births.\n\nAssume a stable antenatal population with $N=1000$ total births.

We formalize this by assuming the probability of transmission from a mother without detectable viremia ($V^c$) is zero.

A mother must be HCV antibody-positive to be tested for and have detectable RNA. Thus, the event $V$ is a subset of the event $AB$. The probability of viremia is the probability of being antibody-positive and then having detectable RNA, which is a conditional probability:\n$$\nP(V) = P(V \\cap AB) = P(V|AB)P(AB)\n$$\nSubstituting the given parameters:\n- $P(AB) = p_{\\mathrm{HCV}} = 0.01$\n- $P(V|AB) = r_{\\mathrm{RNA}} = 0.70$\nSo, the probability of viremia is:\n$$\nP(V) = r_{\\mathrm{RNA}} \\times p_{\\mathrm{HCV}} = 0.70 \\times 0.01 = 0.007\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the probability of transmission given that the mother is viremic, $P(E|V)$. This probability is conditional on the mother's HIV status.
