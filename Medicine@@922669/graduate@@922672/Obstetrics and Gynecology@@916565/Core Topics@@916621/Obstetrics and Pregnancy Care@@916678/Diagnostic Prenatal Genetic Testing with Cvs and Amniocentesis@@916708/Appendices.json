All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. It presents a standard risk calculation problem in medical epidemiology.\n\nWe begin by formally defining the quantities provided in the problem statement.\nLet $P_{b,CVS}$ be the baseline probability of miscarriage in the $11$ to $13$ week gestational window, and $P_{b,Amnio}$ be the baseline probability of miscarriage in the $16$ to $18$ week gestational window.\nLet $P_{p,CVS}$ be the procedure-attributable excess probability of miscarriage for Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS).\nLet $P_{p,Amnio}$ be the procedure-attributable excess probability of miscarriage for amniocentesis.\n\nThe given values are:\n- $P_{b,CVS} = 0.015$\n- $P_{b,Amnio} = 0.010$\n- $P_{p,CVS} = 0.002$\n- $P_{p,Amnio} = 0.001$\n\nThe problem defines \"absolute risk\" over a window as the probability of miscarriage from any cause within that window. It specifies that the baseline and procedure-attributable components should be treated as independent rare-event contributions. The term \"procedure-attributable excess probability\" is an epidemiological standard that represents the additive risk conferred by an exposure (in this case, the medical procedure) on top of the baseline risk. Therefore, the absolute risk for a given procedure is the sum of the corresponding baseline risk and the procedure-attributable excess risk.\n\nLet $R_{CVS}$ be the absolute risk of miscarriage for a patient undergoing CVS, and $R_{Amnio}$ be the absolute risk for a patient undergoing amniocentesis. Based on the additive model implied by the terminology:\n$$\nR_{CVS} = P_{b,CVS} + P_{p,CVS}\n$$\n$$\nR_{Amnio} = P_{b,Amnio} + P_{p,Amnio}\n$$\nThis additive model is a direct consequence of interpreting \"excess probability\" and is justified by the \"rare-event\" condition. For two independent events, the probability of union $A \\cup B$ is $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)$. For rare events where probabilities are very small, the product term $P(A)P(B)$ is negligible, leading to the approximation $P(A \\cup B) \\approx P(A) + P(B)$.\n\nSubstituting the given values, we calculate the absolute risks:\nFor CVS:\n$$\nR_{CVS} = 0.015 + 0.002 = 0.017\n$$\nFor amniocentesis:\n$$\nR_{Amnio} = 0.010 + 0.001 = 0.011\n$$\nThe problem asks for the absolute risk difference, which we denote as $ARD$, defined as the absolute risk with CVS minus the absolute risk with amniocentesis.\n$$\nARD = R_{CVS} - R_{Amnio}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated absolute risks:\n$$\nARD = 0.017 - 0.011 = 0.006\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal probability rounded to four significant figures.

Short Tandem Repeat (STR) profiling is performed at three autosomal loci that are informative for paternal contribution. At each locus, the biological mother is homozygous for the allele she shares with the fetus, and the fetus is heterozygous, carrying one allele shared with the mother and one paternal-specific allele absent from the mother. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) electropherogram peak heights are recorded in Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU). Assume the following fundamental base:\n\n- In STR genotyping, within a locus, PCR peak height for an allele is proportional to the number of template allele copies and to the mass fraction of that DNA source in the mixture. This proportionality is linear over the dynamic range used.\n- For a heterozygous individual, each allele contributes equally to the locus-specific signal from that individual.\n- In a mixed specimen containing fetal and maternal DNA, the maternal DNA contributes signal only at alleles present in the maternal genotype. The paternal-specific fetal allele receives no contribution from maternal DNA.\n- Ignore stutter and differential amplification among alleles within a locus; treat locus-specific amplification efficiency as equal across contributors and alleles, and let it cancel via ratio-based derivations.\n\nDefine the fetal DNA mass fraction in the specimen as $f$ and the maternal contamination proportion as $m = 1 - f$. For each locus $i$, let $H_{A,i}$ be the observed peak height of the allele shared by mother and fetus, and let $H_{B,i}$ be the observed peak height of the paternal-specific fetal allele.\n\nData:\n- Locus $1$: $H_{A,1} = 3200$ and $H_{B,1} = 950$.\n- Locus $2$: $H_{A,2} = 4100$ and $H_{B,2} = 1200$.\n- Locus $3$: $H_{A,3} = 2800$ and $H_{B,3} = 800$.\n\nUsing only the stated base and assumptions, derive an expression for $f$ in terms of the observed ratio $R_i = H_{B,i}/H_{A,i}$ for each locus, compute $f_i$ at each locus, then compute the specimen-level fetal fraction $\\bar{f}$ as the arithmetic mean of the three $f_i$ values. From this, compute the MCC proportion $m = 1 - \\bar{f}$.

We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe primary task is to quantify the level of Maternal Cell Contamination (MCC) in a Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) specimen and decide on a clinical course of action based on a predefined threshold. This is achieved by analyzing Short Tandem Repeat (STR) profiles.\n\nLet $f$ be the mass fraction of fetal DNA and $m$ be the mass fraction of maternal DNA in the specimen. By definition, these fractions sum to unity: $f + m = 1$, or $m = 1 - f$. For each locus $i$, we are given that the mother is homozygous for an allele (let's call it allele A) and the fetus is heterozygous, possessing the maternal allele A and a unique paternal allele (let's call it allele B).\n\nAccording to the problem's stated base assumptions, the observed peak height of an allele in a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) electropherogram is linearly proportional to the number of template copies of that allele in the initial sample. Let $k_i$ be the locus-specific proportionality constant for locus $i$, which encapsulates factors like amplification efficiency.\n\nThe signal for each allele is the sum of contributions from the maternal and fetal DNA pools.\nThe maternal DNA has a mass fraction of $m = 1 - f$. Since the mother is homozygous for allele A, her entire contribution at this locus is to allele A. The number of template copies is proportional to her mass fraction, so her contribution to the peak height of allele A is $k_i \\cdot m = k_i(1-f)$. Her contribution to allele B is $0$.\n\nThe fetal DNA has a mass fraction of $f$. The fetus is heterozygous (A, B). The problem states that for a heterozygous individual, each allele contributes equally. Therefore, the fetal DNA contributes proportionally to $f/2$ for allele A and $f/2$ for allele B. The fetal contribution to the peak height of allele A is $k_i \\cdot \\frac{f}{2}$, and to the peak height of allele B is also $k_i \\cdot \\frac{f}{2}$.\n\nThe total observed peak heights, $H_{A,i}$ and $H_{B,i}$, are the sum of the maternal and fetal contributions:\nFor the shared allele A:\n$$H_{A,i} = (\\text{Maternal Contribution}) + (\\text{Fetal Contribution}) = k_i(1-f) + k_i\\frac{f}{2} = k_i\\left(1 - f + \\frac{f}{2}\\right) = k_i\\left(1 - \\frac{f}{2}\\right)$$\nFor the paternal-specific allele B:\n$$H_{B,i} = (\\text{Maternal Contribution}) + (\\text{Fetal Contribution}) = 0 + k_i\\frac{f}{2} = k_i\\frac{f}{2}$$\n\nThe problem defines the ratio $R_i = H_{B,i} / H_{A,i}$. Using the expressions above, we can write:\n$$R_i = \\frac{k_i \\frac{f}{2}}{k_i \\left(1 - \\frac{f}{2}\\right)}$$\nThe proportionality constant $k_i$ cancels, as expected.\n$$R_i = \\frac{\\frac{f}{2}}{1 - \\frac{f}{2}}$$\nWe must now solve this equation for $f$ to derive a general formula for the fetal fraction based on the observable ratio $R_i$.\n$$R_i \\left(1 - \\frac{f}{2}\\right) = \\frac{f}{2}$$\n$$R_i - R_i \\frac{f}{2} = \\frac{f}{2}$$\n$$R_i = \\frac{f}{2} + R_i \\frac{f}{2}$$\n$$R_i = \\frac{f}{2} (1 + R_i)$$\n$$2R_i = f (1 + R_i)$$\n$$f = \\frac{2R_i}{1 + R_i}$$\nThis equation allows us to calculate the fetal fraction $f_i$ for each informative locus $i$.\n\nWe now apply this formula to the data provided for the three loci.\n\nFor locus $1$: $H_{A,1} = 3200$ and $H_{B,1} = 950$.\nThe ratio is $R_1 = \\frac{H_{B,1}}{H_{A,1}} = \\frac{950}{3200} = \\frac{19}{64}$.\nThe fetal fraction is $f_1 = \\frac{2R_1}{1+R_1} = \\frac{2(\\frac{19}{64})}{1+\\frac{19}{64}} = \\frac{\\frac{38}{64}}{\\frac{64+19}{64}} = \\frac{38}{83}$.\n\nFor locus $2$: $H_{A,2} = 4100$ and $H_{B,2} = 1200$.\nThe ratio is $R_2 = \\frac{H_{B,2}}{H_{A,2}} = \\frac{1200}{4100} = \\frac{12}{41}$.\nThe fetal fraction is $f_2 = \\frac{2R_2}{1+R_2} = \\frac{2(\\frac{12}{41})}{1+\\frac{12}{41}} = \\frac{\\frac{24}{41}}{\\frac{41+12}{41}} = \\frac{24}{53}$.\n\nFor locus $3$: $H_{A,3} = 2800$ and $H_{B,3} = 800$.\nThe ratio is $R_3 = \\frac{H_{B,3}}{H_{A,3}} = \\frac{800}{2800} = \\frac{2}{7}$.\nThe fetal fraction is $f_3 = \\frac{2R_3}{1+R_3} = \\frac{2(\\frac{2}{7})}{1+\\frac{2}{7}} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{7}}{\\frac{7+2}{7}} = \\frac{4}{9}$.\n\nThe problem specifies to compute the specimen-level fetal fraction $\\bar{f}$ as the arithmetic mean of the three locus-specific values.\n$$\\bar{f} = \\frac{f_1 + f_2 + f_3}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{38}{83} + \\frac{24}{53} + \\frac{4}{9} \\right)$$\nTo compute the value, we convert the fractions to decimals:\n$f_1 \\approx 0.4578313$\n$f_2 \\approx 0.4528302$\n$f_3 \\approx 0.4444444$\n$$\\bar{f} \\approx \\frac{0.4578313 + 0.4528302 + 0.4444444}{3} = \\frac{1.3551059}{3} \\approx 0.4517020$$\nThe MCC proportion, $m$, is then calculated as:\n$$m = 1 - \\bar{f} \\approx 1 - 0.4517020 = 0.5482980$$\nThe problem requires rounding $m$ to four significant figures.\n$$m \\approx 0.5483$$\nThe laboratory policy states that if $m > 0.05$, re-sampling is required.

Consider the following empirically supported modeling assumptions for segregation and viability to the time of CVS, conditioned on conceptions involving a reciprocal translocation carrier, and the performance characteristics of chromosomal microarray for the relevant categories:\n\n1. At the time of fertilization, the distribution of embryonic karyotypes across meiotic segregation classes is: alternate 0.50, adjacent-1 0.30, adjacent-2 0.10, $3{:}1$ 0.10.

It measures the relative amount of DNA across the entire genome by hybridizing patient DNA to millions of probes with known genomic coordinates. Its primary function is to detect copy number variants (CNVs)—that is, microdeletions (loss of DNA material) and microduplications (gain of DNA material). It cannot, by its fundamental design, detect rearrangements of genetic material that do not result in a net change in quantity. These are called copy-neutral or balanced rearrangements.\n\nA balanced reciprocal translocation, such as the parental $t(7;12)(q22;q24)$, involves the exchange of segments between chromosomes $7$ and $12$ with no significant loss or gain of genetic material. A fetus can inherit a truly normal chromosome complement or this balanced translocation. Both karyotypes are copy-neutral. CMA will therefore return a \"normal\" result for both a truly normal fetus and a fetus that is a balanced translocation carrier, as it is blind to the structural rearrangement. While the normal microarray result effectively rules out the unbalanced segregation products (which would have CNVs), it cannot distinguish between the two copy-neutral outcomes. A conventional karyotype, which involves visualizing the metaphase chromosomes, provides structural information. It allows a cytogeneticist to directly observe the size and banding pattern of the chromosomes, thereby unambiguously distinguishing a normal karyotype ($46,XY$ or $46,XX$) from a balanced translocation carrier state ($46,XY,t(7;12)$ or $46,XX,t(7;12)$). This distinction is critical for future reproductive counseling, as a balanced carrier has a substantial risk of producing chromosomally unbalanced gametes. Therefore, karyotyping remains indicated to resolve the ambiguity left by the normal CMA result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4922}$$", "id": "4425345"}]}
