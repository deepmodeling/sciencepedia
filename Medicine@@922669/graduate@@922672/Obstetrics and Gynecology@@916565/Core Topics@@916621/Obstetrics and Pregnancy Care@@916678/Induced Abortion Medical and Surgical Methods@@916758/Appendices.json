We shall use Bayes' theorem for this calculation.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant events based on the problem statement:\n- Let $E$ be the event that the individual has an ectopic pregnancy.\n- Let $I$ be the event that the individual has an intrauterine pregnancy.\n- Let $N$ be the event that the individual is not pregnant.\nThese three events are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, forming a partition of the event space.\n\nThe clinical findings, which constitute our evidence, are:\n- $U+$: The point-of-care urine hCG test is positive.\n- $H_{\\ge\\theta}$: The quantitative serum hCG is at or above the discriminatory zone, $\\theta = 1500$ mIU/mL.

We are thus calculating $P(E | F)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(E | F) = \\frac{P(F | E) P(E)}{P(F)} $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(F)$, is the marginal probability of observing the findings. It can be expanded using the law of total probability over the partition $\\{E, I, N\\}$:\n$$ P(F) = P(F | E) P(E) + P(F | I) P(I) + P(F | N) P(N) $$\n\nNext, we establish the prior probabilities of the states $E$, $I$, and $N$ from the given information:\n- Probability of being pregnant, $P(\\text{Preg}) = \\pi = 0.90$.\n- Probability of not being pregnant, $P(N) = 1 - \\pi = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n- Conditional probability of ectopic pregnancy given pregnancy, $P(E | \\text{Preg}) = \\rho = 0.02$.\n- Conditional probability of intrauterine pregnancy given pregnancy, $P(I | \\text{Preg}) = 1 - \\rho = 0.98$.\n\nThe unconditional (prior) probabilities for $E$ and $I$ are:\n$$ P(E) = P(E | \\text{Preg}) P(\\text{Preg}) = \\rho \\pi = (0.02)(0.90) = 0.018 $$\n$$ P(I) = P(I | \\text{Preg}) P(\\text{Preg}) = (1 - \\rho) \\pi = (0.98)(0.90) = 0.882 $$\n\nNow, we must evaluate the likelihood of the findings for each state, $P(F|S)$ for $S \\in \\{E, I, N\\}$.

For the urine hCG test (Test 1):\n    - Sensitivity $\\Se_1 = P(U+ | \\text{Preg}) = 0.98$.

For the serum hCG level being above the discriminatory zone:\n    - $P(H_{\\ge\\theta} | E) = q_D = 0.55$.\n    - $P(H_{\\ge\\theta} | I) = q_I = 0.85$.\n    - $P(H_{\\ge\\theta} | N) = q_N = 0$.\n\n3.  For the TVUS test (Test 2), applied when $H_{\\ge\\theta}$ is true:\n    - Sensitivity $\\Se_2 = P(T+ | H_{\\ge\\theta}, E) = 0.95$.\n    - Specificity $\\Sp_2 = P(T- | H_{\\ge\\theta}, I) = 0.93$, so the false positive rate is $P(T+ | H_{\\ge\\theta}, I) = 1 - \\Sp_2 = 1 - 0.93 = 0.07$.\n    - The TVUS finding for a non-pregnant individual is not explicitly needed, as seen below.\n\nNow we can compute the joint likelihood multiplied by the prior for each state:\n- For ectopic pregnancy ($E$):\n$P(F|E)P(E) = [P(U+|E)P(H_{\\ge\\theta}|E)P(T+|H_{\\ge\\theta},E)]P(E)$\n$P(F|E)P(E) = (0.98) \\times (0.55) \\times (0.95) \\times (0.018)$\n$P(F|E)P(E) = (0.51205) \\times (0.018) = 0.0092169$\n\n- For intrauterine pregnancy ($I$):\n$P(F|I)P(I) = [P(U+|I)P(H_{\\ge\\theta}|I)P(T+|H_{\\ge\\theta},I)]P(I)$\n$P(F|I)P(I) = (0.98) \\times (0.85) \\times (0.07) \\times (0.882)$\n$P(F|I)P(I) = (0.05831) \\times (0.882) = 0.05142942$\n\n- For not pregnant ($N$):\n$P(F|N)P(N) = [P(U+|N)P(H_{\\ge\\theta}|N)P(T+|H_{\\ge\\theta},N)]P(N)$\nSince $P(H_{\\ge\\theta}|N) = q_N = 0$, the entire term is zero:\n$P(F|N)P(N) = (0.03) \\times (0) \\times P(T+|H_{\\ge\\theta},N) \\times (0.10) = 0$\n\nNow, we can assemble the final Bayesian calculation.
