A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the fundamental definitions provided. Let $P_b$ represent the baseline uterine tone. Let the set of peak pressures for the $N$ contractions observed in the $10$-minute epoch be $\\{P_{peak,i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$. The problem states that $N=5$ and the baseline tone is $P_b = 15$ millimeters of mercury. The peak pressures are given as $P_{peak,1} = 40$, $P_{peak,2} = 55$, $P_{peak,3} = 50$, $P_{peak,4} = 60$, and $P_{peak,5} = 45$, all in units of millimeters of mercury.\n\nAccording to the provided definition, the amplitude of the $i$-th contraction, denoted as $A_i$, is the increment in pressure above the baseline. This is expressed mathematically as:\n$$A_i = P_{peak,i} - P_b$$\n\nWe calculate the amplitude for each of the $5$ contractions:\n- For the first contraction: $A_1 = P_{peak,1} - P_b = 40 - 15 = 25$ millimeters of mercury.\n- For the second contraction: $A_2 = P_{peak,2} - P_b = 55 - 15 = 40$ millimeters of mercury.\n- For the third contraction: $A_3 = P_{peak,3} - P_b = 50 - 15 = 35$ millimeters of mercury.\n- For the fourth contraction: $A_4 = P_{peak,4} - P_b = 60 - 15 = 45$ millimeters of mercury.\n- For the fifth contraction: $A_5 = P_{peak,5} - P_b = 45 - 15 = 30$ millimeters of mercury.\n\nThe second definition provided is for Montevideo units (MVUs), which are defined as the sum of the amplitudes of all contractions occurring within a $10$-minute period. Mathematically, this is:\n$$MVU = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} A_i$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated amplitudes into this summation:\n$$MVU = A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 + A_5$$\n$$MVU = 25 + 40 + 35 + 45 + 30$$\n$$MVU = 175$$\n\nThe total Montevideo units for this $10$-minute epoch are $175$. The units are implicitly millimeters of mercury aggregated over $10$ minutes, which is the definition of an MVU.\n\nThe problem also requires an interpretation of this result based on accepted obstetric practice. In clinical obstetrics, uterine contraction patterns are generally considered adequate for promoting cervical change during the active phase of labor if the Montevideo units are greater than $200$. Since the calculated value is $175$ MVUs, this level of uterine activity would typically be considered inadequate for ensuring normal labor progress.\n\nThe final numerical result is $175$.

It is well-posed, objective, and grounded in established clinical and engineering principles. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of MVU Inflation**\n\nFirst, we calculate the true MVU based only on the $5$ physiologic contractions. The amplitude of each contraction is $A_i = P_{\\text{peak},i} - P_b$. With $P_b = 15$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ and $P_{\\text{peak}} = \\{70, 65, 75, 60, 80\\}$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, the amplitudes are:\n*   $A_1 = 70 - 15 = 55$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n*   $A_2 = 65 - 15 = 50$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n*   $A_3 = 75 - 15 = 60$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n*   $A_4 = 60 - 15 = 45$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n*   $A_5 = 80 - 15 = 65$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n\nThe true MVU, which we denote as $\\text{MVU}_{\\text{true}}$, is the sum of these amplitudes:\n$$ \\text{MVU}_{\\text{true}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} A_i = 55 + 50 + 60 + 45 + 65 = 275 \\text{ MVU} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the \"amplitude\" of the artifact spike if it were naively included as a contraction. Its peak pressure is $130$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n$$ A_{\\text{artifact}} = 130 \\text{ mmHg} - 15 \\text{ mmHg} = 115 \\text{ mmHg} $$\n\nA naive computation of MVU, $\\text{MVU}_{\\text{naive}}$, would sum the amplitudes of the $5$ true contractions and the artifact:\n$$ \\text{MVU}_{\\text{naive}} = \\text{MVU}_{\\text{true}} + A_{\\text{artifact}} = 275 + 115 = 390 \\text{ MVU} $$\n\nThe additive inflation is the difference between the naive and true MVU, which is exactly $A_{\\text{artifact}} = 115$ MVU.\n\nThe multiplicative inflation factor is the ratio of the naive MVU to the true MVU:\n$$ \\text{Inflation Factor} = \\frac{\\text{MVU}_{\\text{naive}}}{\\text{MVU}_{\\text{true}}} = \\frac{\\text{MVU}_{\\text{true}} + A_{\\text{artifact}}}{\\text{MVU}_{\\text{true}}} = 1 + \\frac{A_{\\text{artifact}}}{\\text{MVU}_{\\text{true}}} $$\nIn the notation of option A, where $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i$ represents the sum of true contraction amplitudes, this is $1 + \\dfrac{A_{\\text{artifact}}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i}$.\n\n**Part 2: Proposal of Robust Estimators**\n\nThe problem requires proposing robust estimators. The artifact is characterized by a short duration ($d_{\\text{artifact}} \\approx 3$ s) and high slew rate ($|s_{\\text{artifact}}| \\gg 3$ $\\mathrm{mmHg/s}$). Physiologic contractions have long durations ($d_i \\in [60, 90]$ s) and low slew rates ($|s_i| < 3$ $\\mathrm{mmHg/s}$).\n\n1.  **Morphology-based weighting:** An estimator of the form $\\text{MVU}_{\\text{robust}} = \\sum_{i} w_i A_i$ where weights $w_i \\in [0, 1]$ are based on morphology. The weight $w_i$ should be approximately $1$ for physiologic contractions and approximately $0$ for artifacts.\n2.  **Distributional-robustness:** Methods from robust statistics can be applied to the set of detected amplitudes $\\{45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 115\\}$. These methods are designed to be insensitive to outliers like $115$. Examples include trimmed sums (removing the largest and smallest values) and winsorized sums (replacing extreme values). Outliers can be formally identified using rules based on the median and median absolute deviation (MAD).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. If the spike is included as a contraction, the naive MVU defined as $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i$ is inflated by exactly $A_{\\text{artifact}}$, and the multiplicative inflation factor is $1 + \\dfrac{A_{\\text{artifact}}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i}$.**\nAs derived in Part 1, the naive sum is $\\text{MVU}_{\\text{naive}} = (\\sum A_{\\text{true}}) + A_{\\text{artifact}}$. The inflation is indeed $A_{\\text{artifact}}$. The multiplicative factor is $\\text{MVU}_{\\text{naive}} / \\text{MVU}_{\\text{true}} = 1 + A_{\\text{artifact}} / (\\sum A_{\\text{true}})$. This statement is a direct and correct algebraic consequence of the definition of MVU.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A robust MVU estimator that multiplies each peak amplitude $A_i$ by a morphology-based weight $w_i$ defined as $w_i = \\mathbf{1}\\{ d_i \\in [30, 120] \\} \\cdot \\min\\!\\left( 1, \\dfrac{c}{|s_i|} \\right)$, where $d_i$ is peak duration in seconds, $s_i$ is maximum slew rate in $\\mathrm{mmHg/s}$, and $c$ is a positive constant, will down-weight short, high-slew artifacts while preserving physiologic contractions.**\nLet's analyze the proposed weight $w_i$.\n*   **Indicator Function Term $\\mathbf{1}\\{ d_i \\in [30, 120] \\}$**: For the artifact, the duration is $d_{\\text{artifact}} \\approx 3$ s, which is not in the interval $[30, 120]$. This term evaluates to $0$, making the entire weight $w_{\\text{artifact}} = 0$. For physiologic contractions, durations are $d_i \\in [60, 90]$, which is within the interval, so this term is $1$.\n*   **Slew Rate Term $\\min\\!\\left( 1, \\dfrac{c}{|s_i|} \\right)$**: For physiologic contractions, $|s_i| < 3$ $\\mathrm{mmHg/s}$. If we choose the constant $c \\ge 3$ $\\mathrm{mmHg/s}$, then $c/|s_i| \\ge 1$, and this term evaluates to $\\min(1, \\ge 1) = 1$. For the artifact, the slew rate $|s_{\\text{artifact}}|$ is very large. For instance, the rise from $15$ to $130$ mmHg in approximately $1.5$ s implies a slew rate of roughly $(130-15)/1.5 \\approx 77$ $\\mathrm{mmHg/s}$. For large $|s_{\\text{artifact}}|$, the term $c/|s_{\\text{artifact}}|$ approaches $0$, causing this part of the weight to be very small.\nThe product of these two terms effectively assigns a weight of $w \\approx 1$ to physiologic contractions and $w=0$ to the artifact due to its short duration. The formulation is a principled way to incorporate the known morphological differences to create a robust estimator.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Computing MVU as the root-mean-square (RMS) of all amplitudes over $10$ minutes is superior to the sum because it reduces sensitivity to large outliers.**\nThe RMS of a set of values $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_N\\}$ is $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2}$. The squaring operation gives disproportionately large weight to values with large magnitudes. Therefore, the RMS is *more*, not less, sensitive to large outliers than the arithmetic mean or the sum. For example, for the set of amplitudes $\\{45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 115\\}$, the large value $115$ will dominate the sum of squares, pulling the RMS value upwards significantly. Thus, the claim that RMS reduces sensitivity to large outliers is factually incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A $10\\%$ symmetric trimmed sum of peak amplitudes around the median, or a winsorized sum using median absolute deviation (MAD) thresholds, are principled robust alternatives that will eliminate the artifact when its amplitude lies beyond $k$ times the MAD for an appropriately chosen $k$.**\nThis statement proposes two standard methods from robust statistics. Let's analyze their applicability. The set of amplitudes is $\\{45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 115\\}$.\n1.  **Trimmed Sum:** A symmetric trimmed sum involves sorting the data and discarding a percentage of values from both the low and high ends. A $10\\%$ trim on $6$ data points would mean trimming $0.6$ points from each end. Typically this would be interpreted as trimming the single lowest and single highest value (a $1/6 \\approx 16.7\\%$ trim), which would remove $45$ and the artifact $115$. This method is a valid way to handle outliers.\n2.  **MAD-based methods:** First, we compute the median and MAD. The sorted data is $\\{45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 115\\}$. The median is $(55+60)/2 = 57.5$. The absolute deviations from the median are $\\{12.5, 7.5, 2.5, 2.5, 7.5, 57.5\\}$. The median of these deviations is the MAD: $(7.5+7.5)/2 = 7.5$. An outlier is typically identified if its deviation from the median is greater than $k \\cdot \\text{MAD}$ for some $k$ (e.g., $k=3$). The artifact's deviation is $57.5$. The threshold would be $k \\cdot \\text{MAD} = 3 \\times 7.5 = 22.5$. Since $57.5 > 22.5$, the artifact is correctly identified as an outlier. A winsorized sum would then replace the value $115$ with a less extreme value (e.g., median $+ k \\cdot \\text{MAD}$), effectively mitigating its influence. Both trimmed sums and MAD-based methods are indeed principled, robust alternatives that would eliminate or greatly reduce the effect of the artifact.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Baseline correction by subtracting the mean pressure over $10$ minutes from each peak amplitude will neutralize artifacts that are isolated spikes of short duration.**\nThe standard baseline is the resting tone, $P_b = 15$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$. Using the mean pressure over the entire $10$-minute window as the baseline is a different approach. The mean pressure, $\\bar{P}$, will be an average of the low resting tone and the higher pressures during contractions and the spike. Therefore, $\\bar{P}$ will necessarily be greater than $P_b$. Let's estimate it: there are approximately $5 \\times 75s = 375s$ of contractions and $3s$ of spike over a $600s$ window. The mean pressure will be significantly higher than $15$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ (a rough estimate places it around $30-35$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$). When this new, higher baseline $\\bar{P}$ is subtracted from all peaks, the calculated amplitudes of *both* the physiologic contractions and the artifact will decrease. The artifact's peak is $130$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$; its new amplitude will be $130 - \\bar{P}$. A physiologic peak is, for example, $70$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$; its new amplitude will be $70 - \\bar{P}$. While the absolute value of the artifact's amplitude is reduced, it is not \"neutralized\". It remains a large value that will distort the sum, and its relative contribution compared to the true contractions might not be significantly diminished. This method does not specifically target or remove the artifact based on its identifying characteristics (short duration, high slew).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "4522262"}]}
