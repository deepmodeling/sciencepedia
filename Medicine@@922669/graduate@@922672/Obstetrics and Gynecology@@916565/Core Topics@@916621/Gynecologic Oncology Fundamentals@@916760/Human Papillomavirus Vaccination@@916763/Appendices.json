A confidence interval for the $IRR$ is constructed using the specified log-normal approximation method, which is then transformed into a confidence interval for $VE$.\n\nLet $E_v$ and $T_v$ be the number of events and person-years in the vaccinated arm, respectively.\nLet $E_c$ and $T_c$ be the number of events and person-years in the control arm, respectively.\n\nThe incidence rate ($I$) is defined as the number of events per unit of person-time. The point estimates for the incidence rates in the two arms are:\n- Vaccinated arm: $\\hat{I}_v = \\frac{E_v}{T_v}$\n- Control arm: $\\hat{I}_c = \\frac{E_c}{T_c}$\n\nThe incidence rate ratio ($IRR$) is the ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated arm to that in the control arm. Its point estimate is:\n$$ \\widehat{IRR} = \\frac{\\hat{I}_v}{\\hat{I}_c} = \\frac{E_v / T_v}{E_c / T_c} $$\n\nVaccine efficacy ($VE$) is defined as the proportional reduction in disease incidence attributable to the vaccine. It is calculated from the $IRR$:\n$$ \\widehat{VE} = 1 - \\widehat{IRR} $$\n\nUsing the provided data:\n$E_v = 24$\n$T_v = 50{,}200$\n$E_c = 81$\n$T_c = 49{,}300$\n\nFirst, we calculate the point estimate of the $IRR$:\n$$ \\widehat{IRR} = \\frac{24 / 50{,}200}{81 / 49{,}300} = \\frac{24 \\times 49{,}300}{81 \\times 50{,}200} = \\frac{1{,}183{,}200}{4{,}066{,}200} \\approx 0.2910088 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the point estimate of the vaccine efficacy:\n$$ \\widehat{VE} = 1 - \\widehat{IRR} \\approx 1 - 0.2910088 = 0.7089912 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the point estimate for $VE$ is $0.709$.\n\nTo compute the $95\\%$ confidence interval, we use the specified log-normal method. This method assumes that the natural logarithm of the estimated $IRR$, $\\ln(\\widehat{IRR})$, is approximately normally distributed. The variance of $\\ln(\\widehat{IRR})$ is estimated as the sum of the reciprocals of the event counts in each arm, based on the assumption of a Poisson process for the event counts.\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{IRR})) \\approx \\frac{1}{E_v} + \\frac{1}{E_c} $$\nThe standard error ($SE$) is the square root of the variance:\n$$ SE(\\ln(\\widehat{IRR})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{E_v} + \\frac{1}{E_c}} $$\nSubstituting the given event counts:\n$$ SE(\\ln(\\widehat{IRR})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{24} + \\frac{1}{81}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.041666... + 0.012345...} = \\sqrt{0.0540123...} \\approx 0.2324056 $$\n\nA two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval for $\\ln(IRR)$ is given by:\n$$ \\ln(\\widehat{IRR}) \\pm z_{0.975} \\times SE(\\ln(\\widehat{IRR})) $$\nwhere $z_{0.975}$ is the $97.5$-th percentile of the standard normal distribution, which is approximately $1.96$.\n\nWe have $\\ln(\\widehat{IRR}) \\approx \\ln(0.2910088) \\approx -1.234407$.\nThe margin of error for the log-transformed ratio is:\n$$ M = 1.96 \\times 0.2324056 \\approx 0.455515 $$\nThe $95\\%$ CI for $\\ln(IRR)$ is:\n$$ -1.234407 \\pm 0.455515 $$\nwhich gives the interval $(-1.689922, -0.778892)$.\n\nTo find the confidence interval for the $IRR$, we exponentiate the bounds of the interval for $\\ln(IRR)$:\n$$ IRR_{LB} = \\exp(-1.689922) \\approx 0.18453 $$\n$$ IRR_{UB} = \\exp(-0.778892) \\approx 0.45890 $$\nThe $95\\%$ CI for $IRR$ is approximately $(0.1845, 0.4589)$.\n\nFinally, we transform the confidence interval for the $IRR$ into a confidence interval for vaccine efficacy using the relationship $VE = 1 - IRR$. Since this is a decreasing function, the lower bound of the $VE$ corresponds to the upper bound of the $IRR$, and vice-versa.\n$$ VE_{LB} = 1 - IRR_{UB} \\approx 1 - 0.45890 = 0.54110 $$\n$$ VE_{UB} = 1 - IRR_{LB} \\approx 1 - 0.18453 = 0.81547 $$\n\nThe resulting $95\\%$ confidence interval for vaccine efficacy is approximately $(0.54110, 0.81547)$.\n\nThe final step is to report the point estimate and confidence bounds rounded to three significant figures.\n- Point estimate for $VE$: $0.7089912 \\approx 0.709$\n- Lower confidence bound for $VE$: $0.54110 \\approx 0.541$\n- Upper confidence bound for $VE$: $0.81547 \\approx 0.815$\n\nThe three requested numbers are the point estimate, the lower confidence bound, and the upper confidence bound, in that order.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.709 & 0.541 & 0.815\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4450752"}, {"introduction": "While vaccine efficacy tells us how well a vaccine can work under ideal trial conditions, public health professionals must translate this into real-world impact.
