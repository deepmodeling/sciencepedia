It is free from subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The solution will be derived as requested.\n\nThe first objective is to derive an expression for the post-test probability of disease given a negative test, $\\Pr(D \\mid T-)$. We begin with Bayes’ theorem:\n$$\n\\Pr(D \\mid T-) = \\frac{\\Pr(T- \\mid D) \\Pr(D)}{\\Pr(T-)}\n$$\nThe terms in this expression can be related to the given parameters $p$, $S$, and $Sp$.\nThe pretest probability of disease is the prevalence, $p$:\n$$\n\\Pr(D) = p\n$$\nThe probability of a negative test given that the disease is present, $\\Pr(T- \\mid D)$, is the false negative rate. This is the complement of the sensitivity, $S = \\Pr(T+ \\mid D)$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\Pr(T- \\mid D) = 1 - \\Pr(T+ \\mid D) = 1 - S\n$$\nThe denominator, $\\Pr(T-)$, is the overall probability of a negative test. It can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$\n\\Pr(T-) = \\Pr(T- \\mid D)\\Pr(D) + \\Pr(T- \\mid \\neg D)\\Pr(\\neg D)\n$$\nWe can express the terms in this expansion using the given parameters. The probability of not having the disease is the complement of the prevalence:\n$$\n\\Pr(\\neg D) = 1 - \\Pr(D) = 1 - p\n$$\nThe probability of a negative test given no disease, $\\Pr(T- \\mid \\neg D)$, is the definition of specificity, $Sp$:\n$$\n\\Pr(T- \\mid \\neg D) = Sp\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the law of total probability gives:\n$$\n\\Pr(T-) = (1 - S)p + Sp(1 - p)\n$$\nNow, by substituting the expressions for $\\Pr(T- \\mid D)$, $\\Pr(D)$, and $\\Pr(T-)$ back into Bayes' theorem, we obtain the desired expression for the post-test probability:\n$$\n\\Pr(D \\mid T-) = \\frac{(1 - S) p}{(1 - S)p + Sp(1 - p)}\n$$\nThis expression, also known as the complement of the Negative Predictive Value (NPV), fulfills the first part of the problem.\n\nThe second objective is to find the maximum baseline prevalence, denoted as $p^{*}$, for which the post-test risk is exactly equal to the threshold $r$. We set $\\Pr(D \\mid T-) = r$ and solve for $p = p^{*}$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{(1 - S) p^{*}}{(1 - S)p^{*} + Sp(1 - p^{*})}\n$$\nTo solve for $p^{*}$, we perform algebraic manipulation:\n$$\nr \\left[ (1 - S)p^{*} + Sp(1 - p^{*}) \\right] = (1 - S) p^{*}\n$$\n$$\nr(1 - S)p^{*} + r \\cdot Sp - r \\cdot Sp \\cdot p^{*} = (1 - S) p^{*}\n$$\nWe collect terms containing $p^{*}$ on one side of the equation and the constant term on the other side:\n$$\nr \\cdot Sp = (1 - S) p^{*} - r(1 - S)p^{*} + r \\cdot Sp \\cdot p^{*}\n$$\nFactor out $p^{*}$:\n$$\nr \\cdot Sp = p^{*} \\left[ (1 - S) - r(1 - S) + r \\cdot Sp \\right]\n$$\n$$\nr \\cdot Sp = p^{*} \\left[ (1 - S)(1 - r) + r \\cdot Sp \\right]\n$$\nIsolating $p^{*}$ yields the final symbolic expression:\n$$\np^{*} = \\frac{r \\cdot Sp}{(1 - S)(1 - r) + r \\cdot Sp}\n$$\nThe final step is to compute the numerical value of $p^{*}$ using the given values: $S = 0.96$, $Sp = 0.55$, and $r = 0.01$.\n$$\np^{*} = \\frac{(0.01)(0.55)}{(1 - 0.96)(1 - 0.01) + (0.01)(0.55)}\n$$\n$$\np^{*} = \\frac{0.0055}{(0.04)(0.99) + 0.0055}\n$$\n$$\np^{*} = \\frac{0.0055}{0.0396 + 0.0055}\n$$\n$$\np^{*} = \\frac{0.0055}{0.0451}\n$$\n$$\np^{*} \\approx 0.1219512195...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.1220$.\nThis means that if the baseline prevalence of endometrial carcinoma in the population of postmenopausal women with bleeding is $12.20\\%$ or less, the strategy of forgoing immediate biopsy for women with an endometrial thickness $\\leq 4$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ will ensure that the risk of a missed cancer is at or below the acceptable threshold of $1\\%$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1220}$$", "id": "4431306"}, {"introduction": "Minimizing iatrogenic risk is a cornerstone of procedural safety.

Then, model the safety margin for insertion depth using a probabilistic approach based on measurement uncertainty and fundal tolerance, and compute the maximum planned insertion depth that achieves a specified risk target.\n\nAssume the following scientifically realistic set-up:\n- The true uterine cavity length is an unknown constant denoted $L_{t}$.\n- The measured uterine length by sounding is denoted $L_{m}$ and is modeled as $L_{m} = L_{t} + E_{m}$, where $E_{m}$ is a zero-mean, independent, approximately Gaussian error with standard deviation $\\sigma_{m}$.\n- The executed insertion depth relative to the planned mark has an implementation error $E_{i}$ (operator and device control variability), independent of $E_{m}$, zero-mean Gaussian with standard deviation $\\sigma_{i}$.\n- The biopsy cannula can be advanced beyond the true fundal position by up to a fundal tolerance $T$ without clinically significant risk; advancement beyond $L_{t} + T$ is considered a perforation-risk event.\n- Let the planned insertion depth be $D_{\\text{plan}} = L_{m} - s$, where $s$ is a safety back-off margin to be derived.

The endometrial cavity has a finite length from the external cervical os to the fundus, denoted $L_{t}$. Perforation risk arises if an instrument is advanced beyond the fundal endometrium by more than a small, tolerable compression distance $T$. Sounding is performed to estimate the cavity length and direction to align subsequent instrumentation with the uterine axis, reduce insertion against the wrong wall, and set a planned depth that minimizes the probability of overshooting the fundus beyond the tolerated distance.
