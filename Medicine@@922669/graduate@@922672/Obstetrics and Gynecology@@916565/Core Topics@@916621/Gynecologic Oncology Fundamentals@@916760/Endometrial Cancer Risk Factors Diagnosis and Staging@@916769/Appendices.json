Based on integrated clinical risk stratification that incorporates endometrial thickness on transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) and risk factors, the pretest probability of endometrial carcinoma in this subgroup is estimated at $0.10$. An office endometrial biopsy (EMB) is performed. For the target condition of endometrial carcinoma (reference standard: surgical pathology or longitudinal follow-up adjudication), the EMB has sensitivity $0.90$ and specificity $0.98$.

Assume the test characteristics apply to this patient subgroup and that disease status is binary (present or absent) with no verification bias.\n\nReport the final post-test probability as a decimal without a percent sign, rounding to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The scenario described is a standard application of Bayesian inference in medical diagnostics. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the individual has endometrial carcinoma, and let $D^c$ be the event that the individual does not. Let $T^-$ be the event of a negative endometrial biopsy (EMB) result, and $T^+$ be the event of a positive result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe pretest probability of endometrial carcinoma is $P(D) = 0.10$.\nThe probability of not having the disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\nThe sensitivity of the EMB is the probability of a positive test given the disease is present: $S_e = P(T^+|D) = 0.90$.\nThe specificity of the EMB is the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent: $S_p = P(T^-|D^c) = 0.98$.\n\nWe are asked to find the post-test probability of endometrial carcinoma given a negative EMB result. This corresponds to the conditional probability $P(D|T^-)$.\n\nWe begin the derivation from the fundamental definition of conditional probability:\n$$\nP(D|T^-) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^-)}{P(T^-)}\n$$\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T^-)$, is the joint probability of having the disease and testing negative. This can be re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability, $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$, which implies $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$. Thus:\n$$\nP(D \\cap T^-) = P(T^-|D) P(D)\n$$\nThe term $P(T^-|D)$ is the probability of a negative test given the disease is present. This is the false negative rate. Since an individual with the disease can either test positive or negative, we have $P(T^+|D) + P(T^-|D) = 1$. Therefore, $P(T^-|D) = 1 - P(T^+|D) = 1 - S_e$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for the numerator gives:\n$$\nP(D \\cap T^-) = (1 - S_e) P(D)\n$$\nNext, we evaluate the denominator, $P(T^-)$, which is the total probability of receiving a negative test result. According to the law of total probability, we can express $P(T^-)$ by conditioning on the presence or absence of the disease:\n$$\nP(T^-) = P(T^- \\cap D) + P(T^- \\cap D^c)\n$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term:\n$$\nP(T^-) = P(T^-|D) P(D) + P(T^-|D^c) P(D^c)\n$$\nWe can express the terms in this sum using the given parameters:\n$P(T^-|D) = 1 - S_e$\n$P(D)$ is the pretest probability.\n$P(T^-|D^c) = S_p$ (by definition of specificity).\n$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(T^-)$:\n$$\nP(T^-) = (1 - S_e) P(D) + S_p (1 - P(D))\n$$\nNow, we combine the derived expressions for the numerator and the denominator to obtain the final formula for the post-test probability $P(D|T^-)$:\n$$\nP(D|T^-) = \\frac{(1 - S_e) P(D)}{(1 - S_e) P(D) + S_p (1 - P(D))}\n$$\nThis is the general expression derived from the specified first principles.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement into this expression:\n$P(D) = 0.10$\n$S_e = 0.90$\n$S_p = 0.98$\n\n$$\nP(D|T^-) = \\frac{(1 - 0.90) \\times 0.10}{(1 - 0.90) \\times 0.10 + 0.98 \\times (1 - 0.10)}\n$$\n$$\nP(D|T^-) = \\frac{0.10 \\times 0.10}{0.10 \\times 0.10 + 0.98 \\times 0.90}\n$$\n$$\nP(D|T^-) = \\frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.882}\n$$\n$$\nP(D|T^-) = \\frac{0.01}{0.892}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nP(D|T^-) \\approx 0.0112107623...\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.
