The following preoperative characteristics are known: age $48$ years, body mass index (BMI) $42$, visible varicose veins confirmed on physical examination, current combined oral contraceptive use, no personal history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and no active malignancy. The planned operative duration is estimated at $90$ minutes. Use the Caprini Risk Assessment Model (RAM), which is a validated, additive point-based tool for preoperative VTE risk stratification, together with Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) principles in gynecologic surgery, to determine the risk score and a corresponding prophylaxis recommendation.\n\nFundamental base (well-tested facts to be used):\n- The Caprini RAM assigns points to independent risk factors, and the total score is the sum of individual points. For the risk factors relevant to this case, use the following validated assignments: age $41$–$60$ years $\\rightarrow 1$ point; obesity ($\\text{BMI} \\ge 25$) $\\rightarrow 1$ point; varicose veins $\\rightarrow 1$ point; current combined oral contraceptive or estrogen therapy $\\rightarrow 1$ point; laparoscopic surgery with expected duration $> 45$ minutes $\\rightarrow 2$ points.\n- Gynecologic ERAS guidance for minimally invasive benign surgery applies risk-stratified VTE prophylaxis using the Caprini RAM: total score $0$–$1$ (low risk) $\\rightarrow$ early ambulation only; total score $2$ (moderate risk) $\\rightarrow$ mechanical prophylaxis; total score $3$–$4$ (higher but not high) $\\rightarrow$ mechanical prophylaxis; total score $\\ge 5$ (high risk) $\\rightarrow$ combined mechanical plus pharmacologic prophylaxis, with consideration of extended pharmacologic prophylaxis primarily in the presence of malignancy or very high scores.\n- Mechanical prophylaxis refers to intermittent pneumatic compression and early ambulation; pharmacologic prophylaxis refers to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or low-dose unfractionated heparin (LDUH), assuming acceptable bleeding risk.\n\nTask:\n1.

The patient has varicose veins, so this contributes $1$ point.\n4. Current combined oral contraceptive or estrogen therapy contributes $1$ point. The patient uses combined oral contraceptives, so this contributes $1$ point.\n5. Laparoscopic surgery with expected duration $> 45$ minutes contributes $2$ points.

We will proceed by first principles.\n\nLet the following variables be defined:\n- $D_{\\text{max,spec}}$ is the maximum recommended mass-specific dose of bupivacaine, given as $2.5\\,\\text{mg/kg}$.\n- $m_{\\text{patient}}$ is the patient's actual body weight, given as $70\\,\\text{kg}$.\n- $M_{\\text{max,bupi}}$ is the maximum total mass of bupivacaine that can be administered to this patient.\n- $C_{\\text{stock}}$ is the concentration of the stock bupivacaine solution provided by the pharmacy, given as $2.5\\,\\text{mg/mL}$.\n- The dilution ratio is $1:1$ with normal saline.\n- $C_{\\text{diluted}}$ is the concentration of the final, diluted bupivacaine solution.\n- $V_{\\text{max,diluted}}$ is the maximum total volume of the diluted solution that can be administered.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the maximum permissible mass of bupivacaine for this specific patient. This is derived from the definition of a mass-specific dose:\n$$M_{\\text{max,bupi}} = D_{\\text{max,spec}} \\times m_{\\text{patient}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$M_{\\text{max,bupi}} = (2.5\\,\\text{mg/kg}) \\times (70\\,\\text{kg}) = 175\\,\\text{mg}$$\nThus, the total mass of bupivacaine administered for wound infiltration must not exceed $175\\,\\text{mg}$.\n\nThe second step is to determine the concentration of the bupivacaine solution after dilution. A $1:1$ dilution with normal saline means that one part of the stock bupivacaine solution is mixed with one part of diluent (saline). Let $V_{\\text{stock}}$ be a volume of the stock solution. The mass of bupivacaine in this volume is $m_{\\text{bupi}} = C_{\\text{stock}} \\times V_{\\text{stock}}$. When this volume is diluted $1:1$, the volume of saline added is equal to $V_{\\text{stock}}$. The total volume of the new solution, $V_{\\text{diluted}}$, is:\n$$V_{\\text{diluted}} = V_{\\text{stock}} + V_{\\text{saline}} = V_{\\text{stock}} + V_{\\text{stock}} = 2V_{\\text{stock}}$$\nThe mass of bupivacaine remains unchanged. The new concentration, $C_{\\text{diluted}}$, is the mass of the drug divided by the new total volume:\n$$C_{\\text{diluted}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{bupi}}}{V_{\\text{diluted}}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{stock}} \\times V_{\\text{stock}}}{2V_{\\text{stock}}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{stock}}}{2}$$\nSubstituting the given stock concentration:\n$$C_{\\text{diluted}} = \\frac{2.5\\,\\text{mg/mL}}{2} = 1.25\\,\\text{mg/mL}$$\n\nThe third and final step is to calculate the maximum volume of this diluted solution that contains the maximum permissible mass of bupivacaine, $M_{\\text{max,bupi}}$. Using the fundamental definition of concentration, $C = \\frac{M}{V}$, we can solve for volume, $V = \\frac{M}{C}$.\nTherefore, the maximum volume of the diluted solution is:\n$$V_{\\text{max,diluted}} = \\frac{M_{\\text{max,bupi}}}{C_{\\text{diluted}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$V_{\\text{max,diluted}} = \\frac{175\\,\\text{mg}}{1.25\\,\\text{mg/mL}} = 140\\,\\text{mL}$$\nThe result is an exact integer, $140$. The problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The number $140$ can be represented as $1.40 \\times 10^2$, which has three significant figures. Thus, the value $140$ meets the specified precision requirement without any need for rounding.\n\nFor completeness in ERAS team training, as requested by the problem, we will now identify the key elements for the recognition and initial management of Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST). This is a critical safety component of any procedure involving the administration of significant doses of local anesthetics.\n\n**Recognition of LAST:**\nThe signs and symptoms of LAST are typically biphasic, involving the central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular system.\n1.  **CNS Manifestations:** Early signs are often excitatory and include perioral numbness, metallic taste in the mouth, tinnitus, lightheadedness, visual disturbances, disorientation, and muscle twitching. These can rapidly progress to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, followed by CNS depression, characterized by drowsiness, loss of consciousness, coma, and respiratory arrest.\n2.  **Cardiovascular Manifestations:** Initial signs may be hyperdynamic (hypertension, tachycardia), but these are quickly followed by cardiodepression, including hypotension, bradydysrhythmias, and ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation). Profound cardiovascular collapse and asystole can occur, sometimes without preceding CNS symptoms, particularly with bupivacaine.\n\n**Initial Management of LAST:**\nThe management of LAST is a medical emergency requiring a structured, immediate response.\n1.  **Stop Injection:** Immediately cease administration of the local anesthetic.\n2.  **Call for Help:** Activate emergency response systems (e.g., Code Blue) and request a \"LAST Rescue Kit\" which contains lipid emulsion.\n3.  **Airway Management:** Ensure a patent airway and administer $100\\%$ oxygen to prevent hypoxia and hypercarbia, which exacerbate toxicity. Intubate the trachea if necessary to protect the airway and facilitate ventilation.\n4.  **Seizure Suppression:** Treat seizures with a benzodiazepine (e.g., midazolam, diazepam), which is the first-line therapy. Small, incremental doses of propofol may be considered, but caution is warranted as it can worsen myocardial depression.\n5.  **Lipid Emulsion Therapy:** Administer $20\\%$ lipid emulsion, which is the specific antidote. Follow established protocols, such as those from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA), which typically involve an initial bolus followed by an infusion.\n6.  **Cardiovascular Support:** Manage cardiac arrhythmias and instability according to advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocols, with important modifications. Use smaller doses of epinephrine ($1\\,\\mu\\text{g/kg}$). Avoid vasopressin, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers. Amiodarone is the preferred antiarrhythmic for ventricular arrhythmias. In the event of cardiac arrest, prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may be required as lipid emulsion can take time to exert its effect.\n\nThis completes the required analysis.
