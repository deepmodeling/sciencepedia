The model described is a simplified but standard representation of endocrine feedback, and all required information is present, provided a reasonable interpretation of the \"positive intercept\" is made.

The net inhibitory burden on gonadotropes is described as a first-order linearization with respect to estradiol ($E_2$) and inhibin B ($I_B$), having a positive intercept and positive slopes $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.

Let us denote the event of pregnancy (conception) in a given cycle by $C$.

Let $O$ be the event that ovulation occurs in a given cycle, and $O^c$ be the event that it does not.
