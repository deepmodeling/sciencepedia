For the purposes of this question, primary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menarche by age $15$ years in the presence of otherwise normal growth, or by age $13$ years in the absence of secondary sexual characteristics. The cases below are presented with sufficient data to infer the principal abnormal level of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and the likely structural or endocrine etiology, as well as the most appropriate immediate next diagnostic or therapeutic step. Use foundational physiology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and embryologic development of the Müllerian system to determine the best-integrated response for each case. Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH), Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), and Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome will be referenced.\n\nCase $1$: A $14$-year-old with primary amenorrhea reports cramping pelvic pain that recurs every $28$ days for the past $6$ months. She has Tanner stage $V$ breast development and normal axillary and pubic hair. Pelvic examination reveals a tense, bulging, bluish membrane at the vaginal introitus. Transabdominal ultrasound shows a distended vagina and uterine cavity with echogenic fluid. Serum $FSH$, $LH$, and estradiol are within age-appropriate ranges.\n\nCase $2$: A $17$-year-old with primary amenorrhea has Tanner stage $V$ breasts but scant pubic and axillary hair.

A tense, bulging, bluish membrane is at the vaginal introitus.\n- Imaging: Transabdominal ultrasound shows a distended vagina and uterine cavity with echogenic fluid (hematocolpos and hematometra).\n- Laboratory Values: Serum FSH, LH, and estradiol are within age-appropriate ranges.\n\n**Case 2**:\n- Patient: $17$-year-old female.\n- Presentation: Primary amenorrhea.\n- Physical Examination: Tanner stage $V$ breasts, scant pubic and axillary hair. External genitalia are female. No virilization.\n- Imaging: Pelvic ultrasound shows absence of a uterus and a short blind-ending vaginal pouch.\n- Laboratory Values: Serum total testosterone is $220\\,\\mathrm{ng/dL}$. LH is normal-to-high.\n\n**Case 3**:\n- Patient: $15$-year-old female.\n- Presentation: Primary amenorrhea, short stature, webbed neck, shield chest.\n- Physical Examination: Minimal breast development. Blood pressure is $130/80\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n- Imaging: Pelvic ultrasound shows streak gonads and a small uterus.\n- Laboratory Values: Serum FSH is $68\\,\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$, LH is $40\\,\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$, and estradiol is low.\n\n**Case 4**:\n- Patient: $16$-year-old female.\n- Presentation: Primary amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and intermittent headaches.\n- Urine test: Pregnancy test is negative.\n- Laboratory Values: Serum prolactin is $96\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$. TSH is $2.0\\,\\mathrm{mIU/L}$. FSH and LH are low.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The four cases are classic, distinct presentations of different etiologies for primary amenorrhea. The provided clinical data, including physical exam findings, imaging results, and laboratory values, are internally consistent for each case and plausible within a medical context. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information to deduce a most likely diagnosis and subsequent management step for each case. The language is objective and clinical. There are no scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Analysis**\n\nThe analysis will proceed by examining each case to determine the etiology and the most logical next step.\n\n**Case 1 Analysis:**\nThis patient has normal secondary sexual development (Tanner stage $V$ breasts, pubic hair), cyclical pain, and normal gonadotropin and estradiol levels. This indicates a functioning hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis leading to normal ovarian steroidogenesis and endometrial proliferation. The cyclical pain is consistent with menstrual cycles where outflow is blocked. The physical finding of a \"bulging, bluish membrane at the vaginal introitus\" combined with ultrasound evidence of a distended vagina and uterus filled with fluid (hematocolpos/hematometra) is pathognomonic for an outflow tract obstruction at the level of the hymen.\n- **Etiology:** Imperforate hymen.\n- **Next Step:** The obstruction is mechanical and must be relieved surgically. The appropriate procedure is a **hymenotomy** to drain the accumulated menstrual blood and establish a patent outflow tract.\n\n**Case 2 Analysis:**\nThis patient presents with primary amenorrhea and a discordant development of secondary sexual characteristics: well-developed breasts (Tanner stage $V$) but scant axillary and pubic hair. The external genitalia are female, but internal Müllerian structures (uterus) are absent. The key laboratory finding is a serum testosterone level in the normal male range ($220\\,\\mathrm{ng/dL}$). This combination of findings points to an androgen receptor defect.\n- **Etiology:** **Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS)**. These individuals are genotypically male ($46,XY$) with testes that produce testosterone and Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH). AMH causes regression of Müllerian ducts, hence the absent uterus. The testes produce testosterone, but the non-functional androgen receptors prevent Wolffian duct development and virilization (e.g., development of sexual hair). The high levels of circulating testosterone are aromatized to estrogen in peripheral tissues, leading to breast development. The normal-to-high LH is due to lack of negative feedback by testosterone at the pituitary, as the androgen receptors there are also insensitive.\n- **Next Step:** The diagnosis should be confirmed with a **karyotype analysis**, which will show a $46,XY$ pattern. Due to an increased risk of malignancy (gonadoblastoma) in the undescended testes, a **postpubertal gonadectomy** is the standard of care. The surgery is performed after puberty to allow for the completion of spontaneous, estrogen-driven breast development.\n\n**Case 3 Analysis:**\nThis patient presents with primary amenorrhea and lack of breast development, along with classic physical stigmata (short stature, webbed neck, shield chest). The laboratory results show markedly elevated FSH ($68\\,\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$) and LH ($40\\,\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$) with low estradiol. This hormonal profile is characteristic of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, indicating primary ovarian failure. The ultrasound finding of \"streak gonads\" confirms the lack of functional ovarian tissue. The uterus is present but small, as it has not been stimulated by estrogen.\n- **Etiology:** The constellation of findings is classic for **Gonadal Dysgenesis due to Turner Syndrome**.\n- **Next Step:** The clinical diagnosis must be confirmed with a **karyotype analysis** (typically revealing $45,X$ or mosaicism). Management is then focused on addressing the consequences of gonadal failure. To induce puberty, promote growth, and maintain bone health, hormone replacement therapy with **estrogen and progestin** should be initiated. The elevated blood pressure also requires investigation, often for associated renal or cardiac (e.g., coarctation of the aorta) anomalies common in Turner Syndrome, but the immediate endocrinological step is to confirm the diagnosis and plan for pubertal induction.\n\n**Case 4 Analysis:**\nThis patient has primary amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and headaches. Laboratory findings show a significantly elevated prolactin level ($96\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$), with suppressed gonadotropins (low FSH and LH). This is a state of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. A negative pregnancy test excludes pregnancy as a cause of amenorrhea. The normal TSH level ($2.0\\,\\mathrm{mIU/L}$) rules out primary hypothyroidism, where elevated TRH can co-stimulate prolactin release.\n- **Etiology:** The combination of galactorrhea, amenorrhea, and a high prolactin level strongly suggests a **prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma (prolactinoma)**. The elevated prolactin directly inhibits GnRH pulsatility from the hypothalamus, leading to low FSH/LH and consequent anovulation/amenorrhea. The headaches are likely a result of the mass effect of the pituitary tumor.\n- **Next Step:** To confirm the presence and size of the suspected pituitary adenoma, imaging of the sella turcica is required. **Pituitary MRI** with contrast is the gold standard imaging modality due to its superior spatial resolution for soft tissue structures compared to a CT scan.\n\n**Option-by-Option Evaluation**\n\n- **A. Case $1$: Imperforate hymen; perform hymenotomy. Case $2$: Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome; confirm with karyotype ($46,XY$) and plan postpubertal gonadectomy. Case $3$: Gonadal dysgenesis (Turner syndrome); confirm with karyotype and initiate estrogen-progestin induction. Case $4$: Hyperprolactinemia due to pituitary adenoma; obtain pituitary $MRI$.**\n  - This option perfectly aligns with the derived analysis for all four cases. The etiology and the next step for each case are clinically correct and logically sound.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Case $1$: Primary dysmenorrhea; start nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Case $2$: MRKH syndrome; obtain renal ultrasound. Case $3$: Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea; increase caloric intake and reduce exercise. Case $4$: Hypothyroidism; start levothyroxine.**\n  - Case $1$: Incorrect. The diagnosis is outflow tract obstruction, not primary dysmenorrhea.\n  - Case $2$: Incorrect. The diagnosis is AIS, not MRKH, based on the male-range testosterone and scant pubic hair.\n  - Case $3$: Incorrect. The patient has hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, not the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism seen in functional hypothalamic amenorrhea.\n  - Case $4$: Incorrect. The TSH is normal, ruling out hypothyroidism as the etiology.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Case $1$: Imperforate hymen; first perform a progesterone withdrawal challenge. Case $2$: Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome; start combined oral contraceptives without further testing. Case $3$: Gonadal dysgenesis (Turner syndrome); perform a progesterone challenge before any imaging. Case $4$: Hyperprolactinemia; begin a dopamine antagonist.**\n  - Case $1$: Incorrect. A progesterone challenge is unnecessary and uninformative when a clear mechanical obstruction is present.\n  - Case $2$: Incorrect. Karyotype confirmation is essential before planning long-term management like gonadectomy. Starting OCPs is not the correct immediate step.\n  - Case $3$: Incorrect. A progesterone challenge will be negative due to the hypoestrogenic state and provides no useful information. Karyotyping is the next step.\n  - Case $4$: Incorrect. Treatment for a prolactinoma is a dopamine **agonist**, not an antagonist. An antagonist would worsen the condition.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Case $1$: Transverse vaginal septum; schedule diagnostic laparoscopy. Case $2$: MRKH syndrome; reassure and no further testing. Case $3$: Constitutional delay; observe and reassess in $2$ years. Case $4$: Hyperprolactinemia; obtain brain computed tomography ($CT$) instead of $MRI$.**\n  - Case $1$: Incorrect. The physical finding is classic for an imperforate hymen, not a transverse septum. Laparoscopy is not the correct next step.\n  - Case $2$: Incorrect. This is AIS, not MRKH. Further testing (karyotype) and management (gonadectomy) are critical.\n  - Case $3$: Incorrect. This is definitive ovarian failure (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism), not a constitutional delay (which would be hypogonadotropic).\n  - Case $4$: Incorrect. MRI is the superior and standard imaging modality for the pituitary, not CT.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n \nBased on a rigorous analysis of each case and the provided options, only option A correctly identifies both the diagnosis and the appropriate immediate next step for all four clinical scenarios.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4500573"}, {"introduction": "Beyond structural and genetic causes, primary amenorrhea can result from a profound energy imbalance, a condition known as Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (FHA).

Let $E_I$ represent the daily dietary energy intake, $E_{EE}$ represent the daily exercise energy expenditure, and $M_{FF}$ represent the fat-free mass.
