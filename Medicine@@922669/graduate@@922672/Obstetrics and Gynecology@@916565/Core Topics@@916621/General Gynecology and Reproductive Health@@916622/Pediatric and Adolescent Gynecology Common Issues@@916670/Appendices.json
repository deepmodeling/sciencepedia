The provided mean height velocities ($\\mu$) for each breast stage are:\n- $\\mu_{B2} = 6.4$ $\\mathrm{cm/year}$\n- $\\mu_{B3} = 8.6$ $\\mathrm{cm/year}$\n- $\\mu_{B4} = 7.3$ $\\mathrm{cm/year}$\n\nComparing these values, the maximum mean height velocity occurs at breast stage $B3$ ($\\mu_{B3} = 8.6$ $\\mathrm{cm/year}$). This stage represents the peak of the estrogen-mediated growth spurt. Clinical evaluation of growth progression in this patient should therefore be benchmarked against the norms for stage $B3$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of Height Velocity**\n\nThe goal is to compute the height velocity ($v$) that is one standard deviation ($1\\sigma$) above the mean ($\\mu$) for the identified stage, $B3$. The parameters for stage $B3$ are given as:\n- Mean height velocity: $\\mu_{B3} = 8.6$ $\\mathrm{cm/year}$\n- Standard deviation: $\\sigma_{B3} = 1.2$ $\\mathrm{cm/year}$\n\nThe height velocity one standard deviation above the mean is calculated as:\n$$v = \\mu_{B3} + 1 \\times \\sigma_{B3}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$v = 8.6 \\, \\mathrm{cm/year} + 1.2 \\, \\mathrm{cm/year}$$\n$$v = 9.8 \\, \\mathrm{cm/year}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $9.8$ has two significant figures. To express this with three significant figures, we add a trailing zero, which is significant in this context.\n$$v = 9.80 \\, \\mathrm{cm/year}$$\nThis value represents the upper boundary of the expected typical range (within $\\pm 1$ standard deviation) for height velocity in a girl at Tanner stage $B3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.80}$$", "id": "4482768"}, {"introduction": "With a firm grasp of normal pubertal landmarks, we can now turn to one of the most common endocrinopathies in adolescents: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).

The problem provides a set of clinical and laboratory data and a formal set of rules for their interpretation. It is self-contained, scientifically grounded in established medical diagnostic guidelines, and well-posed, admitting a unique, logical solution. The language is objective and the data are internally consistent. No flaws are identified. The problem is deemed valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe adolescent-specific diagnostic framework requires the simultaneous presence of two key features:\n$1$. Persistent ovulatory dysfunction.\n$2$. Persistent hyperandrogenism (either clinical or biochemical).\n\nWe will evaluate each criterion systematically based on the provided data.\n\n**Criterion 1: Persistent Ovulatory Dysfunction**\n\nThe rules for diagnosing ovulatory dysfunction in adolescents are based on the patient's gynecologic age, which is the time elapsed since menarche.\nThe patient's current age is $15.8$ years and her age at menarche was $12.2$ years.\nGynecologic age = Current age - Age at menarche\n$$\n\\text{Gynecologic Age} = 15.8 - 12.2 = 3.6 \\, \\text{years}\n$$\nThe provided rules are:\na) For individuals more than $3$ years post menarche, ovulatory dysfunction is indicated by cycle intervals that are consistently less than $21$ days or greater than $35$ days.\nb) For individuals more than $1$ year post menarche, any single cycle interval greater than $90$ days is considered abnormal.\n\nThe patient is $3.6$ years post menarche, so both rules are applicable.\nThe patient's reported menstrual cycle intervals are $45$, $60$, $52$, $47$, $120$, $58$, and $49$ days.\nLet's analyze these intervals against rule (a). Every reported interval is greater than the upper limit of a normal cycle length for this gynecologic age, which is $35$ days.\n$$\n\\{45, 60, 52, 47, 120, 58, 49\\} \\subset \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid x > 35 \\}\n$$\nThus, the condition of consistently having cycle intervals greater than $35$ days is met.\n\nNow, let's analyze the intervals against rule (b). The patient reported one cycle interval of $120$ days. Since $120 > 90$, this condition for abnormal ovulation is also met.\nTherefore, the criterion for persistent ovulatory dysfunction is satisfied.\n\n**Criterion 2: Persistent Hyperandrogenism**\n\nHyperandrogenism can be established clinically or biochemically. The presence of either is sufficient to meet this criterion.\n\n**2a. Clinical Hyperandrogenism (Hirsutism)**\n\nThe diagnostic rule for hirsutism is a modified Ferriman–Gallwey (mFG) score greater than or equal to $8$.\nThe patient's regional mFG scores are:\n- Upper lip: $2$\n- Chin: $2$\n- Chest: $3$\n- Upper back: $2$\n- Lower back: $1$\n- Upper abdomen: $2$\n- Lower abdomen: $3$\n- Upper arm: $2$\n- Thigh: $2$\n\nThe total mFG score is the sum of these regional scores:\n$$\n\\text{mFG Score} = 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 19\n$$\nComparing this to the threshold:\n$$\n19 \\geq 8\n$$\nThe condition is met. The patient has clinical hyperandrogenism. While acne is also a sign of hyperandrogenism, the formal criterion provided relies solely on the mFG score for hirsutism.\n\n**2b. Biochemical Hyperandrogenism**\n\nThe diagnostic rule for biochemical hyperandrogenism is a Free Androgen Index (FAI) exceeding $8.0$ or a calculated free testosterone exceeding $0.034 \\, \\mathrm{nmol/L}$.\n\nLet's first calculate the FAI. The standard formula is:\n$$\n\\text{FAI} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total Testosterone}}{\\text{SHBG}} \\right) \\times 100\n$$\nGiven data:\n- Total testosterone ($T_{total}$) = $2.1 \\, \\mathrm{nmol/L}$\n- Sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) = $18 \\, \\mathrm{nmol/L}$\n$$\n\\text{FAI} = \\left( \\frac{2.1}{18} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 11.67\n$$\nComparing this to the threshold:\n$$\n11.67 > 8.0\n$$\nThis condition is met.\n\nNow let's examine the second part of the biochemical rule, using the calculated free testosterone.\nGiven data:\n- Calculated free testosterone ($T_{free}$) = $0.045 \\, \\mathrm{nmol/L}$\nThe threshold is $0.034 \\, \\mathrm{nmol/L}$.\n$$\n0.045 > 0.034\n$$\nThis condition is also met.\n\nSince at least one condition for biochemical hyperandrogenism is met (in this case, both are), the patient has biochemical hyperandrogenism.\nBecause the patient exhibits both clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism, the overarching criterion for persistent hyperandrogenism is unequivocally satisfied.\n\n**Exclusion of Ultrasonography Data**\n\nThe problem explicitly states that ovarian ultrasonography should be deferred until at least $8$ years post menarche. As the patient is only $3.6$ years post menarche, the ultrasonography findings (ovaries with multiple peripheral follicles and volume approximately $10 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$ bilaterally) are not applicable to the diagnostic process for this individual and must be disregarded, as instructed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe adolescent-specific NIH/AE-PCOS diagnostic criteria require the simultaneous fulfillment of two conditions:\n$1$. Persistent ovulatory dysfunction: This was confirmed.\n$2$. Persistent hyperandrogenism: This was confirmed, both clinically and biochemically.\n\nSince both mandatory criteria are satisfied, the diagnosis of PCOS is established for this adolescent according to the specified framework.\nThe diagnostic indicator $D$ is defined as $1$ if the criteria are met and $0$ otherwise.\nBased on our analysis, the criteria are met.\n$$\nD = 1\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "4482697"}, {"introduction": "A correct diagnosis of PCOS hinges on accurately identifying hyperandrogenism, but interpreting androgen lab results is not always straightforward.

Patient A is a lean $15$-year-old with regular physical activity; Patient B is an obese $15$-year-old with acanthosis nigricans and clinical features of insulin resistance.

Serum albumin is within the reference range for both.\n\nYou are asked to decide how to interpret androgen status in these adolescents. Use as your starting point the following fundamental and well-tested principles: (i) steroid transport in blood includes reversible binding of testosterone ($T$) to sex hormone–binding globulin ($S$) and albumin ($A$); (ii) receptor-accessible “bioavailable” testosterone is the sum of free ($T_{\\text{free}}$) and weakly bound albumin-associated testosterone; (iii) reversible binding obeys the law of mass action with a dissociation constant $K_d$ for $T$–$S$ binding; (iv) hepatic production of SHBG is downregulated by insulin, so states of hyperinsulinemia tend to lower $[S]$. Do not assume or use any specialized shortcut formulas not derivable from these principles.\n\nWhich option best justifies the use of either directly measured free testosterone or a calculated surrogate of free fraction (such as a free androgen index) instead of total testosterone alone in adolescents, and correctly applies this reasoning to the two patients described?\n\nA. Because reversible binding follows mass action, for fixed $[T]_{\\text{tot}}$ an increase in $[S]$ increases $[TS]$ and lowers $T_{\\text{free}}$, making $T_{\\text{free}}$ inversely related to $[S]$. Insulin resistance lowers $[S]$, thereby increasing $T_{\\text{free}}$ at the same $[T]_{\\text{tot}}$. Therefore, free testosterone or a ratio-based surrogate is preferred over total testosterone, and Patient B is more likely to have elevated bioavailable androgen.\n\nB. Total testosterone alone is sufficient because changes in $[S]$ proportionally alter total and free testosterone in the same direction, and insulin resistance increases $[S]$, which would artifactually lower $T_{\\text{free}}$; therefore Patient A would be more likely to have elevated bioavailable androgen.\n\nC. Measurement of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) alone is superior to any testosterone-based metric because DHEAS is not bound to SHBG; therefore its concentration directly reflects ovarian androgenicity in insulin-resistant adolescents, making SHBG considerations unnecessary for Patients A and B.\n\nD. Calculated surrogate indices of free testosterone are inherently unreliable in adolescents because albumin binding is high-affinity and nearly irreversible, so the free fraction is negligible regardless of $[S]$; therefore total testosterone best reflects androgen action, and the two patients have equivalent bioavailable androgen.\n\nE.

The roles of SHBG and albumin in transporting testosterone, the concept of bioavailable versus total hormone, the application of the law of mass action to protein-ligand binding, and the regulation of SHBG by insulin are all fundamental and scientifically correct concepts. The clinical vignettes for Patients A and B represent classic lean and obese phenotypes of PCOS, and the provided biochemical values ($[T]_{\\text{tot}}$, $[S]$) are physiologically plausible for these clinical contexts.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

The provided principles are sufficient to reason through the question without requiring external knowledge or unspecified formulas. The data for the two patients are consistent with the principles (e.g., Patient B's obesity and insulin resistance are consistent with her lower SHBG level, as predicted by Principle iv).\n5.  **Realism and Feasibility**: The scenario is clinically realistic and the data are physically consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. A solution can be derived from the provided information.\n\n### Derivation\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the relationship between total testosterone, binding globulins, and the biologically active testosterone fractions.\n\nAccording to Principle (i), the total concentration of testosterone in the blood, $[T]_{\\text{tot}}$, is the sum of testosterone that is free, bound to SHBG, and bound to albumin:\n$$[T]_{\\text{tot}} = [T_{\\text{free}}] + [TS] + [TA]$$\nwhere $[T_{\\text{free}}]$ is the concentration of free testosterone, $[TS]$ is the concentration of testosterone bound to SHBG, and $[TA]$ is the concentration of testosterone bound to albumin.\n\nPrinciple (iii) states that these binding processes obey the law of mass action. For the high-affinity binding of testosterone to SHBG, the equilibrium is $T + S \\rightleftharpoons TS$. The relationship is governed by the dissociation constant, $K_{d,S}$:\n$$K_{d,S} = \\frac{[T_{\\text{free}}][S_{\\text{free}}]}{[TS]}$$\nwhere $[S_{\\text{free}}]$ is the concentration of unbound SHBG.\n\nThe total concentration of SHBG is $[S]_{\\text{tot}} = [S_{\\text{free}}] + [TS]$. The problem provides the total SHBG concentrations for Patient A and Patient B, which we will denote as $[S]_A$ and $[S]_B$.\n\nThe question is about interpreting androgen status, which depends on the biologically active hormone. Principle (ii) defines bioavailable testosterone as the sum of free and albumin-bound testosterone. Albumin binding is characterized by low affinity and high capacity, meaning the T-A bond dissociates easily, making albumin-bound testosterone accessible to tissues. The biologically most relevant fraction is the free testosterone, $[T_{\\text{free}}]$, which can freely diffuse into cells and bind to androgen receptors. SHBG-bound testosterone, $[TS]$, is a tightly bound reservoir and is generally considered not bioavailable.\n\nWe must analyze how a change in the total SHBG concentration, $[S]_{\\text{tot}}$, affects the concentration of free testosterone, $[T_{\\text{free}}]$, when total testosterone, $[T]_{\\text{tot}}$, is held constant.\n\nConsider the equilibrium $T + S \\rightleftharpoons TS$. According to Le Chatelier's principle, if we have a system at equilibrium, changing the concentration of one of the species will cause the equilibrium to shift to counteract that change. Here, both patients have the same $[T]_{\\text{tot}} = 1.8 \\ \\text{nmol/L}$. However, their SHBG levels differ:\n-   Patient A: $[S]_A = 80 \\ \\text{nmol/L}$\n-   Patient B: $[S]_B = 20 \\ \\text{nmol/L}$\n\nPatient B has a significantly lower concentration of SHBG than Patient A. A lower amount of 'S' in the equilibrium $T + S \\rightleftharpoons TS$ will shift the equilibrium to the left. This means that, for Patient B, a smaller proportion of the total testosterone will be sequestered in the $[TS]$ complex, resulting in a larger proportion remaining as free testosterone, $[T_{\\text{free}}]$.\n\nTherefore, even though $[T]_{\\text{tot}}$ is identical for both patients, Patient B will have a higher concentration of free testosterone than Patient A: $[T_{\\text{free}}]_B > [T_{\\text{free}}]_A$. Since bioavailable testosterone includes $[T_{\\text{free}}]$, Patient B will also have a higher concentration of bioavailable testosterone.\n\nThis conclusion is clinically significant. Patient B exhibits features of insulin resistance. According to Principle (iv), insulin resistance causes hyperinsulinemia, which suppresses hepatic SHBG production, leading to low $[S]$. The low $[S]$ in Patient B is therefore a direct consequence of her metabolic state. This low $[S]$ amplifies the biological effect of her circulating testosterone by increasing the free and bioavailable fractions. Thus, her true androgen burden is higher than Patient A's, despite having the same total testosterone level.\n\nThis illustrates precisely why $[T]_{\\text{tot}}$ alone can be a misleading indicator of androgen status, especially in conditions like PCOS where SHBG levels are often altered. It is necessary to assess the free or bioavailable fraction, either by direct measurement (e.g., equilibrium dialysis, the gold standard) or by using a calculated surrogate, such as the free androgen index (FAI), which is typically $\\frac{[T]_{\\text{tot}}}{[S]_{\\text{tot}}}$. In this case, $\\text{FAI}_B = \\frac{1.8}{20} = 0.09$ is much higher than $\\text{FAI}_A = \\frac{1.8}{80} = 0.0225$ (conventionally multiplied by $100$), confirming that Patient B has a higher effective androgen level.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Because reversible binding follows mass action, for fixed $[T]_{\\text{tot}}$ an increase in $[S]$ increases $[TS]$ and lowers $T_{\\text{free}}$, making $T_{\\text{free}}$ inversely related to $[S]$. Insulin resistance lowers $[S]$, thereby increasing $T_{\\text{free}}$ at the same $[T]_{\\text{tot}}$. Therefore, free testosterone or a ratio-based surrogate is preferred over total testosterone, and Patient B is more likely to have elevated bioavailable androgen.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option correctly describes the law of mass action: for a fixed total, more binding protein ($[S]$) leads to more bound hormone ($[TS]$) and less free hormone ($[T_{\\text{free}}]$), an inverse relationship. It correctly links insulin resistance to lower $[S]$ and consequently higher $[T_{\\text{free}}]$ (as per Principle iv). It correctly concludes that this is why free testosterone or a surrogate is preferred. Finally, it correctly applies the logic to the patients, identifying Patient B (with lower $[S]$) as having the higher bioavailable androgen level.\n-   **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. Total testosterone alone is sufficient because changes in $[S]$ proportionally alter total and free testosterone in the same direction, and insulin resistance increases $[S]$, which would artifactually lower $T_{\\text{free}}$; therefore Patient A would be more likely to have elevated bioavailable androgen.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option contains multiple errors. First, for a fixed $[T]_{\\text{tot}}$, changes in $[S]$ alter $[T_{\\text{free}}]$ in the *opposite* direction. Second, it incorrectly states that insulin resistance *increases* $[S]$, which contradicts Principle (iv). Third, it draws the opposite conclusion about which patient has higher androgenicity.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. Measurement of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) alone is superior to any testosterone-based metric because DHEAS is not bound to SHBG; therefore its concentration directly reflects ovarian androgenicity in insulin-resistant adolescents, making SHBG considerations unnecessary for Patients A and B.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option is incorrect. DHEAS is primarily a product of the adrenal glands, not the ovaries. While it contributes to the total androgen pool, testosterone is the key androgen in PCOS pathophysiology and the main driver of peripheral androgenic effects. Ignoring testosterone and SHBG is incorrect. The problem is specifically about interpreting the given testosterone and SHBG data.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. Calculated surrogate indices of free testosterone are inherently unreliable in adolescents because albumin binding is high-affinity and nearly irreversible, so the free fraction is negligible regardless of $[S]$; therefore total testosterone best reflects androgen action, and the two patients have equivalent bioavailable androgen.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option is factually incorrect. Albumin binding is *low-affinity* and *readily reversible*, which is why it's considered part of the bioavailable pool. SHBG binding is the high-affinity interaction. The free fraction is critically dependent on $[S]$, and the conclusion that the patients have equivalent bioavailable androgen is false.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. The luteinizing hormone to follicle-stimulating hormone ratio directly determines bioavailable androgen independent of binding proteins; SHBG does not materially affect androgen action, so total testosterone alone should be used for Patients A and B.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option is incorrect. The LH/FSH ratio is related to the *production* of testosterone by the ovaries but it does not determine the bioavailable fraction. Bioavailability is critically dependent on binding proteins, especially SHBG. The statement that SHBG does not materially affect androgen action is a direct contradiction of a fundamental principle of endocrinology and the premises of this problem.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4482775"}]}
