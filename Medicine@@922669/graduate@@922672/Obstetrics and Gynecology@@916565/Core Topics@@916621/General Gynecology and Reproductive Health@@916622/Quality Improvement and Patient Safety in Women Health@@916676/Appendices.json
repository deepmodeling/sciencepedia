In this audit, the measure follows the patient safety convention used in maternal sepsis improvement collaboratives: time-to-antibiotic is defined as the elapsed time, in minutes, from the earliest documented recognition of suspected IAI to the start time of the first intravenous antibiotic dose. Recognition time is defined as the earliest charted clinical recognition (note, order, or sepsis screen) indicating suspected IAI; antibiotic start time is the documented time when the infusion begins.\n\nFor a specific case, the earliest recognition of suspected IAI was documented at $14{:}10$, and the first antibiotic infusion was documented to have started at $14{:}55$ on the same calendar day.
