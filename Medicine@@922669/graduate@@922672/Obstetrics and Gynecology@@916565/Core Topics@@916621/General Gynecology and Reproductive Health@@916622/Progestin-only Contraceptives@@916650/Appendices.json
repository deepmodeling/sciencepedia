This practice centers on the critical step of translating pharmacodynamic data into a practical clinical guideline for a patient beginning a progestin-only pill (POP). Understanding the onset of action is paramount to providing advice that ensures protection.

She will either abstain from vaginal intercourse or use a barrier method until the POP is pharmacodynamically protective. You are informed of the following well-tested pharmacodynamic fact: in correctly dosed users, ovulation suppression (the principal mechanism conferring high contraceptive efficacy for desogestrel POP) is established within $48$ hours of the first active tablet. For a conservative, population-level policy that guarantees protection for all users without individualized monitoring, backup contraception should be maintained continuously from initiation until ovulation suppression is assured in the latest-onset case.\n\nAssuming no other modifying clinical factors, determine the minimal duration of backup contraception required after initiation under this conservative policy.

This can be expressed mathematically as an upper bound on the value of $T_{suppress}$ for any user in the population:\n$$0 < T_{suppress} \\le 48 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nThe problem specifies a \"conservative, population-level policy that guarantees protection for all users without individualized monitoring.\" This policy dictates that backup contraception must be maintained until ovulation suppression is \"assured in the latest-onset case.\"\n\nThe \"latest-onset case\" corresponds to the user for whom the time to achieve ovulation suppression is maximal. Based on the provided pharmacodynamic fact, the maximum possible value for $T_{suppress}$ is $48$ hours.\nLet $T_{max\\_suppress}$ be this maximum time.\n$$T_{max\\_suppress} = \\sup\\{T_{suppress}\\} = 48 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nLet $D_{backup}$ be the required duration of backup contraception after initiation at $t=0$. To satisfy the conservative policy, $D_{backup}$ must be at least as long as the time required for the latest-onset case to become protected. Therefore, the duration must satisfy the inequality:\n$$D_{backup} \\ge T_{max\\_suppress}$$\nSubstituting the value of $T_{max\\_suppress}$:\n$$D_{backup} \\ge 48 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nThe question asks for the *minimal* duration of backup contraception required. This corresponds to the shortest possible duration that still complies with the policy, which is the lower bound of the inequality for $D_{backup}$.\n$$D_{backup, min} = 48 \\text{ hours}$$\n\nThe clinical details provided—patient age of $27$ years, nulliparity, and initiation on cycle day $15$—are components of a realistic clinical scenario. However, they are superseded by the problem's explicit instruction to use the universally applicable pharmacodynamic fact and the population-level policy. The policy is designed precisely to obviate the need for individualized assessment of factors such as the patient's specific point in her menstrual cycle. The purpose of the policy is to provide a single, safe recommendation for all users, regardless of such individual variables.\n\nThe final step is to adhere to the output formatting requirement of rounding the result to two significant figures. The calculated duration is $48$ hours. The number $48$ is composed of two digits, both of which are significant. Therefore, the value $48$ is already expressed to two significant figures.

The Pearl Index is a foundational metric in contraceptive epidemiology used to quantify failure rates in clinical studies. It provides a standardized way to express the number of unintended pregnancies per unit of exposure. This problem challenges you to calculate and compare the Pearl Indices for two different progestin-only methods, honing your ability to critically evaluate and quantify the relative efficacy reported in medical literature [@problem_id:4501422].", "problem": "A multicenter pragmatic cohort study compares two progestin-only contraceptive modalities: a daily progestin-only pill (POP) and a single-rod etonogestrel subdermal implant. In the POP cohort, there were $5$ on-treatment pregnancies accrued over $3200$ woman-months of exposure. In the implant cohort, there was $1$ on-treatment pregnancy accrued over $5000$ woman-months of exposure. Use only core definitional bases and well-tested facts: the Pearl Index is defined as the number of on-treatment pregnancies per $100$ woman-years of exposure under risk, and one year consists of $12$ months. Assume exposure time is fully at risk and uniformly distributed without loss to follow-up or differential censoring, and that events are rare enough for rates to approximate underlying hazards over the aggregated intervals.\n\nStarting strictly from the definition of the Pearl Index and fundamental time conversion, derive symbolically and then compute the Pearl Index for each cohort.

The exposure in woman-years, $E_{years}$, is related to the exposure in woman-months, $E_{months}$, by the formula:\n$$E_{years} = \\frac{E_{months}}{12}$$\nSubstituting this conversion into the definition of the Pearl Index allows us to calculate it directly from the given exposure data:\n$$PI = \\frac{N}{\\left(\\frac{E_{months}}{12}\\right)} \\times 100 = \\frac{12 \\times N}{E_{months}} \\times 100 = \\frac{1200 \\times N}{E_{months}}$$\nThis is the operational formula we will use for the calculations.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Pearl Index for the POP cohort, $PI_{POP}$:\n$$PI_{POP} = \\frac{1200 \\times N_{POP}}{E_{POP, months}}$$\nSubstituting the values for the POP cohort:\n$$PI_{POP} = \\frac{1200 \\times 5}{3200} = \\frac{6000}{3200} = \\frac{60}{32} = \\frac{15}{8} = 1.875$$\n\nNext, we calculate the Pearl Index for the implant cohort, $PI_{imp}$:\n$$PI_{imp} = \\frac{1200 \\times N_{imp}}{E_{imp, months}}$$\nSubstituting the values for the implant cohort:\n$$PI_{imp} = \\frac{1200 \\times 1}{5000} = \\frac{1200}{5000} = \\frac{12}{50} = \\frac{6}{25} = 0.24$$\n\nThe final step is to compute the ratio, $R$, of the POP Pearl Index to the implant Pearl Index.\n$$R = \\frac{PI_{POP}}{PI_{imp}}$$\nThe symbolic expression for the ratio is:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{1200 \\times N_{POP}}{E_{POP, months}}}{\\frac{1200 \\times N_{imp}}{E_{imp, months}}} = \\frac{N_{POP}}{E_{POP, months}} \\times \\frac{E_{imp, months}}{N_{imp}}$$\nThis demonstrates that the ratio of Pearl Indices is equivalent to the ratio of the underlying failure rates (pregnancies per unit time), as the arbitrary scaling factor of $1200$ (arising from the convention of $100$ woman-years and $12$ months per year) cancels out.\n\nWe can compute the numerical value of the ratio using the calculated Pearl Indices:\n$$R = \\frac{1.875}{0.24}$$\nAlternatively, we can use the direct ratio of the rates:\n$$R = \\frac{5}{3200} \\times \\frac{5000}{1} = \\frac{25000}{3200} = \\frac{250}{32} = \\frac{125}{16}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$R = 7.8125$$\nThe problem requires this ratio to be rounded to four significant figures.
