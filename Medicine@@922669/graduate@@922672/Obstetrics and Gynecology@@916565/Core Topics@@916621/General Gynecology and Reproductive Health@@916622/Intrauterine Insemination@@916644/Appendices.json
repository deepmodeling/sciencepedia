This is the product of the volume and the concentration.\n$$TSC = V \\times C$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$TSC = 2.0\\,\\text{mL} \\times (30 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{spermatozoa}/\\text{mL}) = 60 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{spermatozoa}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the pre-wash total motile sperm count ($TMSC_{pre}$). This is defined as the total sperm count multiplied by the proportion of progressively motile spermatozoa.\n$$TMSC_{pre} = TSC \\times PM_{pre}$$\nSubstituting the calculated $TSC$ and the given $PM_{pre}$:\n$$TMSC_{pre} = (60 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{spermatozoa}) \\times 0.50 = 30 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{spermatozoa}$$\nThe problem asks for this value to be expressed in millions of spermatozoa.

The problem states that the processing method recovers a fixed fraction, $R$, of the *progressively motile spermatozoa* from the ejaculate. Therefore, the post-wash total motile sperm count is the recovery fraction applied to the pre-wash total motile sperm count.\n$$TMSC_{post} = TMSC_{pre} \\times R$$\nSubstituting the calculated $TMSC_{pre}$ and the given recovery fraction $R$:\n$$TMSC_{post} = (30 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{spermatozoa}) \\times 0.60 = 18 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{spermatozoa}$$\nExpressing this value in millions of spermatozoa, we get $18$.

This relationship is explicitly stated as:\n$$M = C \\times V$$\nThe goal is to deliver a target total motile sperm count, denoted as $M^{\\ast}$. Therefore, we set $M = M^{\\ast}$. The equation becomes:\n$$M^{\\ast} = C \\times V$$\nThe given values are:\n- Target sperm count, $M^{\\ast} = 5 \\times 10^{6}$ sperm.\n- Sperm concentration, $C = 20 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{mL}^{-1}$.\n\nTo find the required volume $V$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$V = \\frac{M^{\\ast}}{C}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values into the equation:\n$$V = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{6}}{20 \\times 10^{6}}$$\nThe term $10^{6}$ is present in both the numerator and the denominator, so it can be canceled out.\n$$V = \\frac{5}{20}$$\nThis fraction simplifies to:\n$$V = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal representation, we obtain:\n$$V = 0.25$$\nThe unit of volume can be verified dimensionally. The unit of $M^{\\ast}$ is a dimensionless count, and the unit of $C$ is $\\text{mL}^{-1}$. Therefore, the unit of $V$ is $\\frac{1}{\\text{mL}^{-1}} = \\text{mL}$, which is consistent with the requirement.\n\nThe problem states that the answer must be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value, $0.25$, has two significant figures (the digits $2$ and $5$). To express this value with three significant figures, a trailing zero must be added after the last non-zero digit.\n$$V \\approx 0.250$$\nThe required insemination volume is $0.250\\ \\text{mL}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.250}$$", "id": "4461012"}, {"introduction": "Effective patient counseling is as crucial as the technical procedure itself, requiring clinicians to translate statistical data into meaningful expectations.

All necessary data and assumptions are provided, rendering the problem valid and solvable.\n\nLet $S$ be the event of a successful live birth in a single intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycle. Let $F$ be the event of failure (no live birth) in a single cycle. The problem states that each cycle is an independent Bernoulli trial with a constant probability of success.\nThe given probability of success for a single cycle is $p = P(S) = 0.12$.\nThe probability of failure for a single cycle is the complement of success, given by:\n$$P(F) = 1 - P(S) = 1 - p$$\nSubstituting the given value for $p$:\n$$P(F) = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88$$\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the cumulative probability of achieving at least one live birth across $n$ cycles. Let $A_n$ be the event of \"at least one live birth in $n$ cycles\".\nDirectly calculating $P(A_n)$ would require summing the probabilities of exactly one success, exactly two successes, and so on, up to exactly $n$ successes, which is a computationally intensive application of the binomial probability formula.\n\nA more direct approach, as suggested by the prompt to use foundational principles, is to use the complement rule. The complement of the event $A_n$ (at least one success) is the event $A_n^c$, which corresponds to \"zero successes in $n$ cycles\". This is equivalent to the event of having a failure in every single one of the $n$ cycles.\n$$A_n^c = F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap \\dots \\cap F_n$$\nwhere $F_i$ is the event of failure on the $i$-th cycle.\n\nAccording to the complement rule, the probability of $A_n$ is:\n$$P(A_n) = 1 - P(A_n^c)$$\n\nThe problem states that the cycles are independent events. Therefore, the probability of the intersection of these $n$ failure events is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(A_n^c) = P(F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap \\dots \\cap F_n) = P(F_1) \\times P(F_2) \\times \\dots \\times P(F_n)$$\n\nFurthermore, the probability of failure is assumed to be constant for each cycle, i.e., $P(F_i) = 1 - p$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThus, the expression for the probability of failure in all $n$ cycles becomes:\n$$P(A_n^c) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} (1 - p) = (1 - p)^n$$\n\nSubstituting this result back into the complement rule equation yields the general expression for the cumulative probability of at least one live birth in $n$ cycles:\n$$P(A_n) = 1 - (1-p)^n$$\nThis derivation relies on the primary assumptions stated in the problem:\n1.  Each IUI cycle is an independent event.\n2.  The probability of success, $p$, is constant for each cycle.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the specific case where the couple undergoes up to $n=3$ cycles and the per-cycle probability of success is $p=0.12$. Let $P_{\\text{cumul}}$ denote this cumulative probability.\n$$P_{\\text{cumul}} = 1 - (1 - 0.12)^3$$\nFirst, calculate the base of the exponent:\n$$1 - 0.12 = 0.88$$\nNow, substitute this value back into the expression:\n$$P_{\\text{cumul}} = 1 - (0.88)^3$$\nCalculate the power:\n$$(0.88)^3 = 0.88 \\times 0.88 \\times 0.88 = 0.7744 \\times 0.88 = 0.681472$$\nFinally, calculate the cumulative probability:\n$$P_{\\text{cumul}} = 1 - 0.681472 = 0.318528$$\n\nThe problem requires the numerical result to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe value is $0.318528$. The first four significant figures are $3$, $1$, $8$, and $5$. The fifth significant figure is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (truncate).\nThe rounded value is $0.3185$.\n\nFinally, a concise clinical interpretation of this result is required.\nThe computed value of $0.3185$ represents the cumulative probability of achieving a successful outcome (a live birth) over a course of up to three treatment cycles, under the specified model assumptions. In a counseling context, this would be explained as follows: \"While the chance of a live birth from any single IUI cycle is $12\\%$, the model predicts that the cumulative chance of achieving at least one live birth increases with successive attempts. After completing up to three cycles, the overall probability of success is approximately $31.85\\%$.
