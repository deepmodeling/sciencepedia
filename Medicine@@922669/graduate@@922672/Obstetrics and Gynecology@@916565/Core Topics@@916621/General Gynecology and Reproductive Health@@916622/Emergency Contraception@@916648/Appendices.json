LH surge precedes follicular rupture (ovulation) by approximately $24$–$36$ hours.\n    2. Sperm can remain viable in the female reproductive tract for up to $5$ days.\n    3. The oocyte remains fertilizable for approximately $12$–$24$ hours after ovulation.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a classic clinical scenario in reproductive endocrinology and relies on established physiological facts about the menstrual cycle, gamete viability, and mechanisms of emergency contraception. The provided data (patient demographics, cycle timing, LH test results) are internally consistent and biologically plausible. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe core of this problem is to determine the patient's position in her ovulatory cycle at the time of presentation and to select the emergency contraception (EC) method whose mechanism of action will be effective at that specific time.\n\n1.  **Timing of the LH Surge and Ovulation:**\n    The patient's home ovulation predictor kit (OPK) detects the urinary excretion of Luteinizing Hormone (LH). The LH surge is the hormonal trigger for ovulation.\n    - On cycle day $11$, the test was negative.\n    - On the evening of cycle day $12$, the test was \"faintly positive,\" indicating the beginning of the LH surge.\n    - On the morning of cycle day $13$ and cycle day $14$, the test was \"strongly positive,\" confirming the surge is well established and has likely peaked.\n    - The problem states that ovulation occurs approximately $24$–$36$ hours after the onset of the LH surge.\n    - Let us define the onset of the surge as the evening of cycle day $12$ (e.g., $18{:}00$).\n    - $24$ hours after this onset would be the evening of cycle day $13$ ($18{:}00$).\n    - $36$ hours after this onset would be the morning of cycle day $14$ ($06{:}00$).\n    - Therefore, ovulation was most likely to occur between the evening of day $13$ and the morning of day $14$. When the patient presents on the morning of cycle day $14$, it is highly probable that ovulation has already occurred or is imminent within hours.\n\n2.  **Assessment of Pregnancy Risk:**\n    - Unprotected intercourse occurred on cycle day $12$ at $22{:}00$.\n    - Sperm can survive for up to $5$ days in the female reproductive tract. Viable sperm would be present from cycle day $12$ through approximately cycle day $17$.\n    - Ovulation likely occurred between late cycle day $13$ and early cycle day $14$.\n    - The oocyte is viable for $12$–$24$ hours.\n    - This timing places viable sperm in the reproductive tract at the exact time of ovulation, creating a high risk of fertilization and pregnancy. Therefore, EC is strongly indicated.\n\n3.  **Analysis of EC Mechanisms of Action in this Context:**\n    - **Hormonal EC (Levonorgestrel and Ulipristal Acetate):** The primary and most well-established mechanism of action for both oral levonorgestrel (LNG) and ulipristal acetate (UPA) is the inhibition or delay of ovulation. They achieve this by interfering with the hormonal signals, particularly the LH surge, that lead to follicular rupture.\n        - **Levonorgestrel (LNG):** LNG is effective at delaying ovulation only if taken *before* the LH surge begins. Once LH levels start to rise, LNG is unable to prevent the ovulatory cascade. In this patient, the LH surge began on cycle day $12$. Administering LNG on cycle day $14$ would be ineffective.\n        - **Ulipristal Acetate (UPA):** UPA, a selective progesterone receptor modulator, is more robust than LNG and can delay ovulation even after the LH surge has begun. However, its efficacy diminishes significantly as it is administered closer to the time of follicular rupture. Studies show that if UPA is given on the day of the LH peak or thereafter, it is no longer effective at delaying ovulation. Given that the patient's LH surge started on cycle day $12$ and she presents on the morning of cycle day $14$, she is likely at or just past the LH peak. It is highly probable that ovulation has already occurred or is unstoppable, rendering UPA ineffective.\n    - **Copper-bearing Intrauterine Device (Cu-IUD):** The Cu-IUD has a dual mechanism of action for EC.\n        - **Pre-fertilization effect:** Copper ions create a cytotoxic environment in the uterus and fallopian tubes that is both spermicidal and ovicidal, thus preventing fertilization.\n        - **Post-fertilization effect:** Should fertilization occur, the Cu-IUD induces a sterile inflammatory response in the endometrium, making it hostile to implantation of the blastocyst.\n    Because of this latter, post-fertilization mechanism, the Cu-IUD is highly effective even when administered after ovulation has occurred. It is the most effective form of EC, with a failure rate of less than $0.1\\%$, and its efficacy is not dependent on the timing of administration relative to ovulation, as long as it is inserted within $5$ days of UPI.\n\n**Conclusion:** For this patient, who has had UPI within the fertile window and is presenting at a time when ovulation has almost certainly occurred, hormonal methods that primarily work by delaying ovulation (LNG and UPA) are unlikely to be effective. The Cu-IUD, which remains effective after ovulation by preventing both fertilization and implantation, is the most efficacious method.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. **Oral levonorgestrel $1.5$ mg taken now as a single dose**: **Incorrect**. Levonorgestrel's primary mechanism is delaying ovulation. It is ineffective once the LH surge has begun. The patient's LH surge started on cycle day $12$, making this option unlikely to be effective on cycle day $14$.\n\nB. **Oral ulipristal acetate $30$ mg taken now as a single dose**: **Incorrect**. While ulipristal acetate can delay ovulation even after the LH surge begins, its efficacy is lost when administered at or after the LH peak. The patient is presenting on cycle day $14$, approximately $36$ hours after her LH surge began, making it very likely that she is at or past her LH peak and that ovulation has occurred or is unstoppable. Therefore, this option is unlikely to be effective.\n\nC. **Immediate insertion of a copper-bearing intrauterine device (IUD) today**: **Correct**. The Cu-IUD is effective at preventing pregnancy even after ovulation has occurred. It acts by preventing fertilization (spermicidal effects) and, crucially in this case, by preventing implantation. It is the most effective form of EC and is the only method listed that would provide high efficacy for this patient's specific timing. The patient does not desire ongoing contraception, but the IUD can be removed after her next menstrual period if she wishes.\n\nD. **No EC is indicated because ovulation has likely already occurred**: **Incorrect**. The premise that ovulation has likely occurred is correct. However, the conclusion that no EC is indicated is dangerously false. The patient had UPI just before ovulation, which constitutes a very high risk of pregnancy. An effective EC method (the Cu-IUD) is available and indicated.\n\nE. **Take levonorgestrel and ulipristal acetate together now to maximize efficacy**: **Incorrect**. This is not a clinically recommended or evidence-based regimen. There is a theoretical concern that the progestin (LNG) could interfere with the receptor modulation activity of UPA, potentially reducing efficacy. Studies have not shown a benefit to co-administration. This option is not standard of care and is potentially less effective than UPA alone (which is itself unlikely to work in this scenario).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4430710"}, {"introduction": "Beyond choosing a method, clinicians must be able to interpret and apply evidence from clinical trials to understand comparative effectiveness.

Let $P_C$ be the probability of pregnancy with no treatment and $P_T$ be the probability of pregnancy with treatment. The ARR is given by:\n$$ARR = P_C - P_T$$\nThis quantity, $ARR$, represents the probability that a single patient who receives the treatment will avert a pregnancy that would have occurred had they not received the treatment.\n\nWe are tasked with deriving the NNT, defined as the expected number of treated patients required to avert one pregnancy. Let us consider a group of $N$ patients, each receiving the treatment. For each patient $i$ in this group (where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$), we can define a random variable, $X_i$, that represents the outcome for that specific patient. Let $X_i = 1$ if a pregnancy is averted for patient $i$, and $X_i = 0$ if a pregnancy is not averted.\n\nThe event \"$X_i = 1$\" occurs if the treatment successfully prevents a pregnancy that would have otherwise happened. The probability of this event, by definition, is the Absolute Risk Reduction.\n$$P(X_i = 1) = ARR$$\nConsequently, the probability that a pregnancy is not averted for patient $i$ is:\n$$P(X_i = 0) = 1 - P(X_i = 1) = 1 - ARR$$\nThe random variable $X_i$ follows a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p = ARR$.\n\nThe expectation, or expected value, of the random variable $X_i$ is, by its fundamental definition, the sum of the product of each possible value of the variable and its corresponding probability:\n$$E[X_i] = \\sum_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}} x \\cdot P(X_i = x)$$\n$$E[X_i] = (1 \\cdot P(X_i = 1)) + (0 \\cdot P(X_i = 0))$$\n$$E[X_i] = (1 \\cdot ARR) + (0 \\cdot (1 - ARR)) = ARR$$\nThis means that for a single treated patient, the expected number of averted pregnancies is equal to the ARR.\n\nNow, let us consider the total number of averted pregnancies, $S_N$, in the group of $N$ treated patients. This total is the sum of the outcomes for each individual patient:\n$$S_N = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\nWe seek the expected value of this sum, $E[S_N]$. Due to the linearity of expectation, the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations:\n$$E[S_N] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\nSince each patient is an independent trial from the same distribution, $E[X_i] = ARR$ for all $i$.\n$$E[S_N] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} ARR = N \\cdot ARR$$\nThis result states that the expected number of averted pregnancies in a group of $N$ treated patients is $N$ times the Absolute Risk Reduction.\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is defined as the expected number of patients that must be treated to avert exactly one pregnancy. This means we must find the value of $N$ for which the expected number of averted pregnancies, $E[S_N]$, is equal to $1$. We set $N = NNT$ and $E[S_{NNT}] = 1$.\n$$NNT \\cdot ARR = 1$$\nSolving for NNT, we arrive at the desired relationship:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nThis completes the derivation based on the fundamental definitions of probability and expectation.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of the NNT Ratio\n\nThe problem provides the following Absolute Risk Reductions:\nFor levonorgestrel (LNG): $ARR_{LNG} = 2.0\\% = 0.020$\nFor ulipristal acetate (UPA): $ARR_{UPA} = 3.0\\% = 0.030$\n\nUsing the derived formula, the NNT for each treatment is:\n$$NNT_{LNG} = \\frac{1}{ARR_{LNG}} = \\frac{1}{0.020} = 50$$\n$$NNT_{UPA} = \\frac{1}{ARR_{UPA}} = \\frac{1}{0.030} = \\frac{100}{3}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the NNT for levonorgestrel to the NNT for ulipristal acetate:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{NNT_{LNG}}{NNT_{UPA}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for NNT in terms of ARR:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{1/ARR_{LNG}}{1/ARR_{UPA}} = \\frac{ARR_{UPA}}{ARR_{LNG}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{0.030}{0.020} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a pure number rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\text{Ratio} = 1.500$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.500}$$", "id": "4430721"}, {"introduction": "Clinical practice is often complicated by uncertainty, such as when a patient's ovulation timing is unknown.

Her last menstrual period is uncertain; she does not use hormonal contraception and has no recent pregnancy. The clinical goal is to choose between oral emergency contraception and device-based emergency contraception under uncertainty about ovulation timing. Consider the following physiology and well-tested facts as the fundamental base:\n\n- After ovulation, luteinization of the ruptured follicle generates the corpus luteum, which secretes progesterone; therefore, serum progesterone is low in the follicular (pre-ovulatory) phase and rises in the luteal (post-ovulatory) phase.\n- Ulipristal acetate (UPA), a selective progesterone receptor modulator, primarily delays or inhibits ovulation and is effective up to $120$ hours after intercourse but has minimal benefit if ovulation has occurred.\n- Levonorgestrel (LNG), a progestin, primarily delays ovulation and is most effective within $72$ hours; efficacy declines near the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge and beyond $72$ hours.\n- Copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) insertion provides high efficacy regardless of ovulation status up to at least $120$ hours, but is invasive and resource-intensive compared to oral agents.\n\nTo operationalize decision-making, suppose a single serum progesterone measurement (nanograms per milliliter, ng/mL) is modeled as follows:\n\n- If pre-ovulatory, serum progesterone $P$ follows a normal distribution $P \\mid \\text{pre} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{0}, \\sigma_{0}^{2})$ with $\\mu_{0} = 0.9$ and $\\sigma_{0} = 0.5$.\n- If post-ovulatory, serum progesterone $P \\mid \\text{post} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{1}, \\sigma_{1}^{2})$ with $\\mu_{1} = 8.0$ and $\\sigma_{1} = 3.0$.\n\nGiven uncertain timing in this patient population, assume prior probabilities $P(\\text{pre}) = 0.6$ and $P(\\text{post}) = 0.4$.

The described physiology of the menstrual cycle, progesterone levels, and the mechanisms of action for UPA and Cu-IUD are consistent with established medical literature. The use of normal distributions to model biological measurements is a standard and valid technique in biostatistics. The parameters are plausible.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is a well-posed binary classification problem within the framework of Bayesian decision theory. It provides all necessary components for a solution: two possible states of nature ($H_0, H_1$), prior probabilities for these states, class-conditional probability distributions (likelihoods) for the measurement, a set of possible decisions ($D_0, D_1$), and a cost matrix. The objective to minimize expected loss defines a unique optimal solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms. The costs associated with incorrect decisions are explicitly defined, removing ambiguity from the optimization goal.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, missing pieces of critical information, or logical flaws. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Optimal Decision Rule\n\nThe goal is to find a decision rule based on the measured serum progesterone level, let's call it $p$, that minimizes the total expected cost, also known as the Bayes risk. We must decide between $D_0$ (recommend UPA) and $D_1$ (recommend Cu-IUD).\n\nThe expected cost (or conditional risk) of making a decision $D_i$ given a measurement $p$ is:\n$R(D_i|p) = \\sum_{j=0}^{1} C(D_i|H_j) P(H_j|p)$\n\nFor decision $D_0$:\n$R(D_0|p) = C(D_0|H_0)P(H_0|p) + C(D_0|H_1)P(H_1|p) = 0 \\cdot P(H_0|p) + C_{\\mathrm{FN}}P(H_1|p) = C_{\\mathrm{FN}}P(H_1|p)$\n\nFor decision $D_1$:\n$R(D_1|p) = C(D_1|H_0)P(H_0|p) + C(D_1|H_1)P(H_1|p) = C_{\\mathrm{FP}}P(H_0|p) + 0 \\cdot P(H_1|p) = C_{\\mathrm{FP}}P(H_0|p)$\n\nThe Bayes decision rule is to choose the decision with the lower expected cost. We choose $D_1$ (recommend Cu-IUD) if $R(D_1|p) < R(D_0|p)$, which means:\n$C_{\\mathrm{FP}}P(H_0|p) < C_{\\mathrm{FN}}P(H_1|p)$\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, $P(H_j|p) = \\frac{p(p|H_j)P(H_j)}{p(p)}$, where $p(p|H_j)$ is the likelihood of observing $p$ given state $H_j$, and $p(p)$ is the evidence. The inequality becomes:\n$C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\frac{p(p|H_0)P(H_0)}{p(p)} < C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\frac{p(p|H_1)P(H_1)}{p(p)}$\n\nThe evidence term $p(p)$ cancels. We can rearrange this into a likelihood-ratio test.

Since progesterone concentration $p$ cannot be negative, the decision rule is to classify as post-ovulatory (decision $D_1$) if $p > 1.8918$.\n\nThe optimal algorithm is a threshold rule: if serum progesterone is above a certain cutoff, classify as post-ovulatory and recommend Cu-IUD; otherwise, classify as pre-ovulatory and recommend UPA. The calculated cutoff value is approximately $1.9$ ng/mL.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Use a fixed clinical threshold: if serum progesterone $\\geq 3.0$ ng/mL, classify as post-ovulatory and recommend Cu-IUD; otherwise, classify as pre-ovulatory and recommend UPA.**\nThis option proposes a cutoff of $3.0$ ng/mL. While this is a plausible clinical heuristic, it is not the threshold that minimizes the expected loss function defined in the problem. The optimal threshold derived from the model is approximately $1.9$ ng/mL. Using a threshold of $3.0$ ng/mL would lead to a higher expected cost than the optimal rule.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Use a Bayes risk-minimizing likelihood-ratio rule yielding a cutoff near serum progesterone $\\approx 1.9$ ng/mL; if serum progesterone $\\geq 1.9$ ng/mL, classify as post-ovulatory and recommend Cu-IUD; otherwise, classify as pre-ovulatory and recommend UPA.**\nThis option correctly describes the methodology used to derive the optimal decision rule (\"Bayes risk-minimizing likelihood-ratio rule\"). Furthermore, it provides a progesterone cutoff value of $\\approx 1.9$ ng/mL, which matches our calculation of $1.8918$ ng/mL. The specified action (recommend Cu-IUD if $p \\geq 1.9$ ng/mL, otherwise UPA) is consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Recommend Cu-IUD regardless of serum progesterone because it is the most effective method up to $120$ hours.**\nThis strategy ignores the information provided by the serum progesterone test. It corresponds to always making decision $D_1$. The expected cost of this strategy is calculated based on the prior probabilities alone: $E[\\text{Cost}] = C(D_1|H_0)P(H_0) + C(D_1|H_1)P(H_1) = C_{\\mathrm{FP}}P(\\text{pre}) + 0 \\cdot P(\\text{post}) = 0.1 \\times 0.6 = 0.06$. By definition, the Bayes-optimal rule (which utilizes the progesterone measurement) must have an expected cost less than or equal to any other rule. As demonstrated in internal calculations, the Bayes risk is approximately $0.01$, which is significantly lower than $0.06$. Therefore, this is not the optimal strategy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Because ulipristal acetate is effective up to $120$ hours, recommend UPA for all; consider Cu-IUD only if serum progesterone $\\geq 10$ ng/mL.**\nThis strategy proposes a threshold of $10$ ng/mL. The reasoning \"Because ulipristal acetate is effective up to $120$ hours, recommend UPA for all...\" is flawed because it neglects the critical fact that UPA is not effective if ovulation has already occurred. The high progesterone threshold of $10$ ng/mL means that many post-ovulatory patients (with progesterone levels between $1.9$ and $10.0$ ng/mL) would be incorrectly given ineffective UPA. This leads to a very high false-negative rate and a consequently high expected loss, which is far from optimal. The cost of this strategy would be much higher than the optimal Bayes rule and even higher than the \"Cu-IUD for all\" strategy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4430674"}]}
