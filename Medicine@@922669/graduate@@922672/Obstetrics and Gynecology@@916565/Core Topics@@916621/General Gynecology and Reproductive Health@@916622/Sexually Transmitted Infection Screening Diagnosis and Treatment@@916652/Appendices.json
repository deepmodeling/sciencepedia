The values provided are plausible for a NAAT test and a sexually active population. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. It is directly relevant to the topic of sexually transmitted infection screening in obstetrics and gynecology. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and requires a formal application of probability theory, making it neither trivial nor unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be generated.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has chlamydia (disease), and $D^c$ be the event that a patient does not have chlamydia. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n- Prevalence: $P(D) = p = 0.06$.\n- The probability of not having the disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.06 = 0.94$.\n- Sensitivity: $P(T^+|D) = \\mathrm{Se} = 0.95$.\n- Specificity: $P(T^-|D^c) = \\mathrm{Sp} = 0.99$.\n\nA **false positive (FP)** occurs when a patient does not have the disease ($D^c$) but tests positive ($T^+$). The probability of this joint event for a single randomly selected patient is given by the product of the probability of not having the disease and the conditional probability of testing positive given no disease. The latter is known as the false positive rate, which is $1 - \\mathrm{Sp}$.\nThe probability of a single patient being a false positive is:\n$$ P(\\text{FP}) = P(T^+ \\cap D^c) = P(T^+|D^c) \\times P(D^c) $$\nFrom the definition of specificity, $P(T^-|D^c) = \\mathrm{Sp}$, and since a test is either positive or negative, $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - \\mathrm{Sp}$.\nThus, the expression for the probability of a false positive is:\n$$ P(\\text{FP}) = (1 - \\mathrm{Sp})(1 - p) $$\nThe expected number of false positives, $E[\\text{FP}]$, in a cohort of size $N$ is the total number of patients multiplied by this probability:\n$$ E[\\text{FP}] = N \\times P(\\text{FP}) = N(1 - \\mathrm{Sp})(1 - p) $$\n\nA **false negative (FN)** occurs when a patient has the disease ($D$) but tests negative ($T^-$). The probability of this joint event for a single randomly selected patient is given by the product of the probability of having the disease and the conditional probability of testing negative given the disease. The latter is known as the false negative rate, which is $1 - \\mathrm{Se}$.\nThe probability of a single patient being a false negative is:\n$$ P(\\text{FN}) = P(T^- \\cap D) = P(T^-|D) \\times P(D) $$\nFrom the definition of sensitivity, $P(T^+|D) = \\mathrm{Se}$, so the probability of a negative test given disease is $P(T^-|D) = 1 - P(T^+|D) = 1 - \\mathrm{Se}$.\nThus, the expression for the probability of a false negative is:\n$$ P(\\text{FN}) = (1 - \\mathrm{Se})p $$\nThe expected number of false negatives, $E[\\text{FN}]$, in a cohort of size $N$ is:\n$$ E[\\text{FN}] = N \\times P(\\text{FN}) = N(1 - \\mathrm{Se})p $$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement into these derived expressions.\n- Total patients: $N = 2000$\n- Prevalence: $p = 0.06$\n- Sensitivity: $\\mathrm{Se} = 0.95$\n- Specificity: $\\mathrm{Sp} = 0.99$\n\nThe expected number of false positives is:\n$$ E[\\text{FP}] = 2000 \\times (1 - 0.99) \\times (1 - 0.06) = 2000 \\times 0.01 \\times 0.94 = 20 \\times 0.94 = 18.8 $$\n\nThe expected number of false negatives is:\n$$ E[\\text{FN}] = 2000 \\times (1 - 0.95) \\times 0.06 = 2000 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.06 = 100 \\times 0.06 = 6 $$\n\n### Clinical Implications\n\nThe analysis yields an expected count of $18.8$ false positives and $6$ false negatives in this cohort of $2000$ patients.\n\nThe **$6$ expected false negatives** represent individuals with chlamydia who are incorrectly told they are uninfected. This is a significant clinical and public health concern. These untreated individuals remain at risk for serious sequelae, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Furthermore, they may unknowingly continue to transmit the infection to sexual partners. This underscores that a negative test, while having a high negative predictive value (NPV), does not grant absolute certainty. Patient counseling should include advice on seeking re-evaluation if symptoms develop or if high-risk exposure continues.\n\nThe **$18.8$ expected false positives** represent individuals without chlamydia who are incorrectly diagnosed with the infection. This leads to psychosocial distress for the patient and their partner(s), and triggers unnecessary partner notification and testing. It also results in the administration of antibiotics without indication, which exposes the patient to potential side effects and contributes to the broader problem of antimicrobial resistance. While chlamydia treatment is typically straightforward, the misdiagnosis can erode patient trust in the healthcare system. Clinical protocols for screening programs must account for false positives. Although the NAAT is highly specific, these results demonstrate that in a population of this size, a non-negligible number of false positives will occur. Counseling for a positive test result should be handled with care, acknowledging the high probability of a true infection but also the small possibility of a false positive. Depending on the clinical context and patient's risk profile, a confirmatory test with a different specimen or target gene might be considered, though this is not standard practice for chlamydia NAATs.\n\nIn summary, these results highlight the trade-offs inherent in any screening program. The high sensitivity and specificity of the NAAT make it an excellent tool, but it is not infallible. Downstream clinical decisions, including treatment, partner services, and patient counseling, must be guided by an understanding of the test's limitations and the probabilistic nature of the results. The management of both false positives and false negatives is critical to optimizing the individual and public health benefits of the screening program.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 18.8 & 6 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4510747"}, {"introduction": "A positive test result does not always mean a patient has the disease; its reliability is critically dependent on disease prevalence.

A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the positive predictive value ($PPV$) of the wet mount test and apply a clinical decision rule. The $PPV$ is the conditional probability that a patient has the disease given a positive test result.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has the disease (*Trichomonas vaginalis* infection), and let $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have the disease. Let $T+$ denote a positive test result and $T-$ denote a negative test result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n-   The prevalence of the disease, $\\mathbb{P}(D) = P = 0.10$.\n-   The probability of not having the disease is $\\mathbb{P}(D^c) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n-   The sensitivity, which is the probability of a positive test given the disease is present: $Se = \\mathbb{P}(T+ \\mid D) = 0.60$.\n-   The specificity, which is the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent: $Sp = \\mathbb{P}(T- \\mid D^c) = 0.98$.\n\nThe positive predictive value ($PPV$) is defined as $\\mathbb{P}(D \\mid T+)$. We use Bayes' theorem to calculate this value:\n$$PPV = \\mathbb{P}(D \\mid T+) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(T+ \\mid D) \\mathbb{P}(D)}{\\mathbb{P}(T+)}$$\nThe denominator, $\\mathbb{P}(T+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result.
