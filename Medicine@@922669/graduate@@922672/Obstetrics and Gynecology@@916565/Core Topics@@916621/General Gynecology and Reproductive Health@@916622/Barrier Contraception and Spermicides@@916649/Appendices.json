A solution will now be derived from first principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of the relative risk reduction (RRR) in condom breakage when switching from an oil-based lubricant to a water-based lubricant.\n\nFirst, we formalize the given information using the provided definitions. \"Risk\" is defined as the per-act probability of the event (condom breakage).\n\nThe baseline exposure is the use of oil-based lubricants. The risk associated with this baseline exposure, let us denote it $R_{\\text{baseline}}$, is the probability of breakage $b_o$.\n$$R_{\\text{baseline}} = b_o = 3\\% = \\frac{3}{100} = 0.03$$\n\nThe intervention exposure is the use of water-based lubricants. The risk associated with this intervention, let us denote it $R_{\\text{intervention}}$, is the probability of breakage $b_w$.\n$$R_{\\text{intervention}} = b_w = 1\\% = \\frac{1}{100} = 0.01$$\n\nThe problem defines \"relative risk reduction (RRR)\" as \"the proportional decrease in risk relative to the baseline exposure.\" We will derive the formula for RRR from this definition.\n\nThe absolute decrease in risk, also known as the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR), is the difference between the baseline risk and the intervention risk.\n$$ARR = R_{\\text{baseline}} - R_{\\text{intervention}}$$\n\nThe \"proportional decrease... relative to the baseline exposure\" means we express this absolute decrease as a fraction of the baseline risk. Therefore, the RRR is the ARR divided by the baseline risk.\n$$RRR = \\frac{ARR}{R_{\\text{baseline}}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{baseline}} - R_{\\text{intervention}}}{R_{\\text{baseline}}}$$\nThis formula is derived directly from the first principles specified in the problem statement.\n\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values for $R_{\\text{baseline}}$ and $R_{\\text{intervention}}$ into this formula.\n$$RRR = \\frac{0.03 - 0.01}{0.03}$$\n\nPerforming the subtraction in the numerator:\n$$RRR = \\frac{0.02}{0.03}$$\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$RRR = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. Converting the fraction $\\frac{2}{3}$ to a decimal yields a repeating decimal:\n$$RRR = 0.666666...$$\n\nRounding this value to four significant figures, we examine the fifth significant figure. Since it is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$RRR \\approx 0.6667$$\n\nThis result signifies that switching from an oil-based lubricant to a water-based one is associated with a $66.67\\%$ reduction in the risk of condom breakage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6667}$$", "id": "4406100"}, {"introduction": "While per-act failure rates are a useful metric, patients are often more concerned with their risk of pregnancy over a period of time, which involves multiple acts.

The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a valid, formalizable problem in applied probability.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of Cumulative Pregnancy Risk\n\nLet the sample space $\\Omega$ consist of all possible outcomes of the $n$ coital acts. Each act is a Bernoulli trial with two outcomes: pregnancy ($S$ for success) or no pregnancy ($F$ for failure). We are given the probability of success for any single act $i$ as $P(\\text{act}_i = S) = p$.\n\nLet $A$ be the event of experiencing at least one pregnancy over the $n$ acts. This event corresponds to observing one or more successes in the sequence of $n$ trials. Calculating the probability of $A$, $P(A)$, directly would require summing the probabilities of mutually exclusive events: exactly one pregnancy, exactly two pregnancies, ..., up to exactly $n$ pregnancies. This is computationally complex.\n\nThe problem directs us to use the complement rule. The complement of event $A$, denoted $A^C$, is the event that there are no pregnancies over the $n$ acts. From the axioms of probability, the probability of an event and its complement must sum to $1$.\n$$P(A) + P(A^C) = 1$$\nTherefore, the probability of at least one pregnancy can be found by calculating the probability of its complement:\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(A^C)$$\n\nThe event $A^C$ means that every one of the $n$ acts results in no pregnancy. Let $F_i$ be the event that no pregnancy occurs during the $i$-th act, for $i$ from $1$ to $n$. Using the complement rule for a single act:\n$$P(F_i) = 1 - P(\\text{success on act } i) = 1 - p$$\nThe event $A^C$ is the intersection of all these individual failure events:\n$$A^C = F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap \\dots \\cap F_n$$\nThe problem states that the coital acts are independent events. The definition of probabilistic independence for $n$ events states that the probability of their intersection is the product of their individual probabilities.\n$$P(A^C) = P(F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap \\dots \\cap F_n) = P(F_1) \\times P(F_2) \\times \\dots \\times P(F_n)$$\nSince the per-act probability of no pregnancy is constant for all acts, $P(F_i) = 1 - p$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$P(A^C) = (1-p) \\times (1-p) \\times \\dots \\times (1-p) \\quad (n \\text{ times})$$\n$$P(A^C) = (1 - p)^n$$\nFinally, we substitute this result back into the expression for $P(A)$:\n$$P(A) = 1 - (1 - p)^n$$\nThis is the cumulative probability of experiencing at least one pregnancy over $n$ acts, derived from first principles as required.\n\n### Qualitative Analysis of Model Assumptions\n\nThe model relies on two critical assumptions: ($1$) the per-act probability of pregnancy, $p$, is constant, and ($2$) the outcomes of the $n$ acts are probabilistically independent. In real-world usage of barrier contraception, both of these assumptions are likely violated.\n\n**Violation of Assumptions:**\nThe assumption of a constant per-act risk, $p$, is a significant simplification. Biologically, the probability of conception is not constant but varies dramatically throughout the female menstrual cycle. It is nearly zero for most of the cycle but rises to a peak during the fertile window around ovulation. If the $n$ coital acts are clustered within this fertile window, the true per-act risk for those specific acts is much higher than an average risk calculated over the entire cycle. Conversely, acts outside this window have a risk approaching zero.\n\nThe independence assumption is also questionable. Behavioral factors can introduce dependence. For example, a failure or a perceived failure of the method on one act (e.g., a condom breaking) may cause a couple to be more meticulous and careful on subsequent acts, thereby lowering the probability of pregnancy. Conversely, repeated successful use without incident might lead to complacency and less careful use over time, increasing the risk. These behavioral feedbacks violate the condition that the outcome of one trial has no influence on the outcome of another.\n\n**Direction of Bias:**\nThe problem asks for the direction of bias when per-act risk varies but is summarized by its mean. Let the true, variable per-act probabilities of pregnancy be $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n$. The model uses their arithmetic mean, $\\bar{p} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i$.\n\nThe true probability of *no* pregnancy over $n$ acts is the product of the individual probabilities of no pregnancy:\n$$P(\\text{no pregnancy})_{\\text{true}} = \\prod_{i=1}^n (1 - p_i)$$\nThe model's calculated probability of no pregnancy is:\n$$P(\\text{no pregnancy})_{\\text{model}} = (1 - \\bar{p})^n$$\nTo compare the cumulative risks, we must compare these two quantities. By the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means (AM-GM), for a set of non-negative numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. Let us apply this to the set of values $\\{1-p_1, 1-p_2, \\dots, 1-p_n\\}$.\n$$\\frac{(1-p_1) + (1-p_2) + \\dots + (1-p_n)}{n} \\ge \\sqrt[n]{(1-p_1)(1-p_2)\\dots(1-p_n)}$$\nThe left side simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{n - \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i}{n} = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n p_i}{n} = 1 - \\bar{p}$$\nThus, the inequality becomes:\n$$1 - \\bar{p} \\ge \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^n (1 - p_i) \\right)^{1/n}$$\nRaising both sides to the $n$-th power (which is a valid, order-preserving operation since both sides are non-negative) yields:\n$$(1 - \\bar{p})^n \\ge \\prod_{i=1}^n (1 - p_i)$$\nThis shows that $P(\\text{no pregnancy})_{\\text{model}} \\ge P(\\text{no pregnancy})_{\\text{true}}$. The model overestimates the probability of avoiding pregnancy.\n\nThe cumulative risk of at least one pregnancy is $1$ minus the probability of no pregnancy. Let $R_{\\text{model}}$ and $R_{\\text{true}}$ be the modeled and true risks, respectively.\n$$R_{\\text{model}} = 1 - (1 - \\bar{p})^n$$\n$$R_{\\text{true}} = 1 - \\prod_{i=1}^n (1 - p_i)$$\nSince $(1 - \\bar{p})^n \\ge \\prod_{i=1}^n (1 - p_i)$, it follows that:\n$$-(1 - \\bar{p})^n \\le -\\prod_{i=1}^n (1 - p_i)$$\n$$1 - (1 - \\bar{p})^n \\le 1 - \\prod_{i=1}^n (1 - p_i)$$\n$$R_{\\text{model}} \\le R_{\\text{true}}$$\nThis demonstrates that using an average per-act risk $\\bar{p}$ in the constant-risk model **underestimates** the true cumulative risk when the actual per-act risks $p_i$ are variable. The non-linear nature of the cumulative risk calculation means that the effect of high-risk acts is not fully offset by low-risk acts, leading to a higher true risk than the averaged model would predict.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 - (1 - p)^n}$$", "id": "4406059"}, {"introduction": "A truly nuanced understanding of contraceptive efficacy requires integrating the probability of method failure with the underlying biological realities of the menstrual cycle.

The probability of intercourse occurring on any specific day $d$ in the set is:\n$$P(D_d) = \\frac{1}{4} \\quad \\text{for } d \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, +1\\}$$\n\nWe can compute the total probability of pregnancy by applying the law of total probability, conditioning on the day of intercourse:\n$$P(P) = \\sum_{d \\in \\{-2, -1, 0, +1\\}} P(P | D_d) P(D_d)$$\n\nNext, for any given day $d$, we must find the conditional probability of pregnancy, $P(P|D_d)$. We can find this by applying the law of total probability again, this time conditioning on the event of semen exposure, $E$:\n$$P(P | D_d) = P(P | E \\cap D_d) P(E | D_d) + P(P | E^c \\cap D_d) P(E^c | D_d)$$\nwhere $E^c$ is the complement of $E$ (no semen exposure).\n\nFrom the problem statement givens and assumptions:\n1.  The probability of semen exposure is $q$, independent of the day $d$. Therefore, $P(E | D_d) = q = 0.03$.\n2.  The probability of no semen exposure is $P(E^c | D_d) = 1 - q = 1 - 0.03 = 0.97$.\n3.  Assumption (i) states that if semen exposure occurs on day $d$, the probability of pregnancy is $p_d$. This means $P(P | E \\cap D_d) = p_d$.\n4.  Assumption (i) also states that if no semen exposure occurs, the probability of pregnancy is $0$.
