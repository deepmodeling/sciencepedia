The models, while simplified, are explicitly defined for the purpose of the calculation.\n\nThe solution is computed in two parts as required by the task.\n\nPart 1: Computation of the expected number of mature oocytes.\n\nThe total number of antral follicles available for recruitment is given as $N = 35$. The recruitment of a follicle depends on its individual follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) threshold, $\\Theta_i$. The thresholds $\\Theta_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, N$ are modeled as independent and identically distributed random variables from a uniform distribution over the interval $[\\theta_{\\min}, \\theta_{\\max}] = [50, 250]\\,\\mathrm{IU/day}$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, a follicle is recruited if the administered daily FSH dose at any time meets or exceeds its threshold $\\Theta_i$.

Let $F$ be the random variable representing the number of recruited follicles. $F$ follows a binomial distribution $F \\sim B(N, p_{\\text{rec}})$.\n\nThe expected number of recruited follicles, $E[F]$, is the mean of this binomial distribution:\n$$\nE[F] = N \\times p_{\\text{rec}} = 35 \\times 0.5 = 17.5\n$$\nThe problem states that conditional on recruitment, the probability that a follicle yields a mature metaphase II (MII) oocyte is $p_{\\mathrm{MII}} = 0.65$. Let $M$ be the number of mature oocytes. The expected number of mature oocytes, $E[M]$, can be calculated using the law of total expectation: $E[M] = E[E[M|F]]$. Given $F$ recruited follicles, the expected number of MII oocytes is $E[M|F] = F \\times p_{\\mathrm{MII}}$.\nThus, the unconditional expectation is:\n$$\nE[M] = E[F \\times p_{\\mathrm{MII}}] = p_{\\mathrm{MII}} \\times E[F] = 0.65 \\times 17.5 = 11.375\n$$\n\nPart 2: Computation of the OHSS mitigation ratio $R$.\n\nThe mitigation ratio $R$ is defined as the ratio of the probability of OHSS under a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) trigger to that under a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) trigger.

In the laboratory cohort from which this blastocyst comes, let the prevalence of whole-embryo trisomy $16$ be $p_{w} = 0.03$, the prevalence of mosaic trisomy $16$ be $p_{m} = 0.05$, and the prevalence of euploid embryos be $p_{e} = 1 - p_{w} - p_{m}$.

The transfer of a mosaic embryo is typically considered only when no euploid embryos are available for transfer.\n2.  **Specific Chromosome and Prognosis:** Trisomy $16$ is the most common trisomy found in first-trimester miscarriages and is generally considered uniformly lethal. A non-mosaic trisomy $16$ embryo would not be viable. The potential of a mosaic embryo is uncertain, but the prognosis is poor. Live births with trisomy $16$ mosaicism are exceptionally rare and are often associated with severe intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), congenital anomalies, and poor postnatal outcomes. The finding could also represent confined placental mosaicism, which does not affect the fetus directly but can still lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia, IUGR, and stillbirth.\n3.  **Genetic Counseling:** Comprehensive genetic counseling is mandatory before considering the transfer of such an embryo. The counseling must cover the high risk of implantation failure, miscarriage, the uncertain and generally poor prognosis if a pregnancy were to be established, and the potential for severe pregnancy complications. The decision to transfer must be a shared one between the clinicians and the fully informed patients.\n4.  **Prenatal Diagnostic Follow-up:** If the embryo is transferred and results in a clinical pregnancy, invasive prenatal diagnostic testing (not screening) is strongly recommended to ascertain the fetal karyotype. This would involve either chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or, more definitively, amniocentesis. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is a screening test and is not sufficient in this high-risk context.\n\nIn summary, an embryo with mosaic trisomy $16$ at any level has a very low priority for transfer due to the lethality associated with this specific aneuploidy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8583}$$", "id": "4454124"}, {"introduction": "Ultimately, the success of IVF/ET is measured by the live birth rate, an outcome that represents the culmination of multiple biological and technical steps.

Assume that across the cohort, every blastocyst that forms is transferred in a single-blastocyst transfer, implantation results in a singleton live birth without pregnancy loss, and there is no multiple gestation.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions from probability theory (chains of conditional events and linearity of expectation), derive the expected number of live births per retrieved MII oocyte across the cohort. Round your final answer to three significant figures and express it as births per retrieved MII oocyte.", "solution": "The problem asks for the expected number of live births per retrieved metaphase II (MII) oocyte. This can be solved by first determining the probability that a single retrieved MII oocyte results in a live birth, and then invoking the principle of linearity of expectation.\n\nLet's define a set of events for a single retrieved MII oocyte's progression:\n- $F$: The oocyte is successfully fertilized.\n- $B$: The fertilized oocyte develops into a blastocyst.\n- $T$: The resulting blastocyst is transferred.\n- $I$: The transferred blastocyst implants.\n- $L$: The implantation leads to a live birth.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following stage-wise conditional probabilities:\n- The probability of fertilization per retrieved MII oocyte is $P(F) = 0.70$.\n- The probability of blastulation conditional on fertilization is $P(B|F) = 0.50$.\n- The probability of implantation per transferred blastocyst is $P(I|T) = 0.40$.\n\nThe problem also includes several simplifying assumptions which translate into conditional probabilities:\n- \"every blastocyst that forms is transferred\" implies that the probability of transfer, given that a blastocyst has formed, is $1$. Therefore, $P(T|B) = 1.0$.\n- \"implantation results in a singleton live birth without pregnancy loss\" implies that the probability of a live birth, given that implantation has occurred, is $1$. Therefore, $P(L|I) = 1.0$.\n\nWe are asked for the expected number of live births per retrieved MII oocyte. Let's consider a large cohort of $n$ retrieved oocytes. Let $X_i$ be an indicator random variable for the $i$-th oocyte (where $i=1, 2, \\dots, n$), such that:\n$$\nX_i = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if the } i\\text{-th oocyte results in a live birth} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe total number of live births, $N_L$, from the cohort of $n$ oocytes is the sum of these indicator variables: $N_L = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$.\n\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected total number of live births is:\n$$E[N_L] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i]$$\nFor an indicator variable, the expectation is equal to the probability of the event it indicates. Thus, $E[X_i] = P(X_i=1)$. Since each oocyte is subject to the same independent probabilities, $P(X_i=1)$ is the same for all $i$. Let this probability be $p_L$, which is the probability of a single oocyte resulting in a live birth, $P(L)$.\nTherefore, $E[X_i] = p_L$ for all $i$, and the expected total number of live births is $E[N_L] = n \\cdot p_L$.\n\nThe expected number of live births per retrieved MII oocyte is this total expectation divided by the number of oocytes, $n$:\n$$\\frac{E[N_L]}{n} = \\frac{n \\cdot p_L}{n} = p_L$$\nThus, our task reduces to calculating $p_L = P(L)$, the probability that a single retrieved oocyte gives rise to a live birth.\n\nA live birth can only occur if all preceding stages are successful. This forms a chain of conditional events. The probability of a live birth, $P(L)$, is the probability of the intersection of all the necessary events: $P(F \\cap B \\cap T \\cap I \\cap L)$.

This allows us to simplify the conditional probabilities:\n- The transfer of an embryo depends only on it becoming a blastocyst, so $P(T|F \\cap B) = P(T|B)$.\n- Implantation depends only on the embryo being transferred, so $P(I|F \\cap B \\cap T) = P(I|T)$.\n- A live birth depends only on implantation, so $P(L|F \\cap B \\cap T \\cap I) = P(L|I)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the chain rule expression yields:\n$$P(L) = P(F) \\cdot P(B|F) \\cdot P(T|B) \\cdot P(I|T) \\cdot P(L|I)$$\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values:\n$$P(L) = (0.70) \\cdot (0.50) \\cdot (1.0) \\cdot (0.40) \\cdot (1.0)$$\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$P(L) = 0.70 \\times 0.50 \\times 0.40$$\n$$P(L) = 0.35 \\times 0.40$$\n$$P(L) = 0.14$$\nThe expected number of live births per retrieved MII oocyte is $0.14$.
