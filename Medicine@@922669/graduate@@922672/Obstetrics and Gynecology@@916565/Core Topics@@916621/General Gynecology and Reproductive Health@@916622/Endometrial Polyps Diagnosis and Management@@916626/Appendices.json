A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### SOLUTION\n\nThe objective is to compute the post-test probability of atypia given a positive test result. We will use the odds formulation of Bayes' theorem as requested.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that atypia is present in the endometrial polyp, and let $T^+$ be the event of a positive SIS finding.\n\nThe given information can be expressed as:\n-   The pretest probability of atypia: $P(A) = p = 0.05$.\n-   The positive likelihood ratio for the SIS test: $LR = \\frac{P(T^+|A)}{P(T^+|\\neg A)} = 3$, where $\\neg A$ is the event that atypia is not present.\n\nThe odds of an event $E$ are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(E) = \\frac{P(E)}{1 - P(E)} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the pretest odds of atypia. These are the odds of atypia being present before the SIS result is known.\n$$ \\text{Pretest Odds}(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{1 - P(A)} = \\frac{p}{1 - p} $$\n\nSubstituting the given value $p = 0.05$:\n$$ \\text{Pretest Odds}(A) = \\frac{0.05}{1 - 0.05} = \\frac{0.05}{0.95} = \\frac{5}{95} = \\frac{1}{19} $$\n\nBayes' theorem in the odds-likelihood form states that the post-test odds are equal to the pretest odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio:\n$$ \\text{Post-test Odds}(A|T^+) = \\text{Pretest Odds}(A) \\times LR $$\n\nThe post-test odds are the odds of atypia being present given the positive test result, $T^+$.\nUsing the calculated pretest odds and the given likelihood ratio $LR=3$:\n$$ \\text{Post-test Odds}(A|T^+) = \\frac{1}{19} \\times 3 = \\frac{3}{19} $$\n\nFinally, we need to convert these post-test odds back into a probability. The post-test probability is denoted as $P(A|T^+)$. The relationship between a probability $P(E)$ and its odds, $\\text{Odds}(E)$, is given by:\n$$ P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(E)}{1 + \\text{Odds}(E)} $$\n\nApplying this formula to our post-test odds:\n$$ P(A|T^+) = \\frac{\\text{Post-test Odds}(A|T^+)}{1 + \\text{Post-test Odds}(A|T^+)} $$\n\nSubstituting the value of the post-test odds:\n$$ P(A|T^+) = \\frac{\\frac{3}{19}}{1 + \\frac{3}{19}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{19}}{\\frac{19}{19} + \\frac{3}{19}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{19}}{\\frac{22}{19}} = \\frac{3}{22} $$\n\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division:\n$$ \\frac{3}{22} \\approx 0.13636363... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P(A|T^+) \\approx 0.1364 $$\n\nThus, the post-test probability of atypia within the polyp following the positive SIS result is approximately $0.1364$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1364}$$", "id": "4433566"}, {"introduction": "Distinguishing an endometrial polyp from retained products of conception (RPOC) in the postpartum period is a common diagnostic challenge, as both can present with abnormal bleeding.

All provided data are medically and scientifically plausible.\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The use of serial $\\beta$-hCG and transvaginal Doppler ultrasound to differentiate postpartum pathologies like retained products of conception (RPOC) from other causes of bleeding is standard medical practice. The physiological principles cited (hCG production by trophoblasts, hCG clearance postpartum, and Doppler reflection of vascularity) are fundamental to the field. The rate of hCG decline is consistent with its biological half-life of approximately $24-36$ hours, suggesting no active source of production. The sonographic and Doppler findings are classic descriptions used in gynecological imaging. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient, consistent, and clear information to allow for a differential diagnosis and formulation of a management plan. A unique, clinically appropriate answer can be derived.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated using objective clinical and diagnostic terminology, free from ambiguity or subjective language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe central task is to distinguish between an endometrial polyp and retained products of conception (RPOC) as the cause of this patient's early postpartum bleeding.\n\n1.  **Analysis of hCG Trend:** The serum $\\beta$-hCG level is a quantitative marker for the presence of viable trophoblastic tissue. RPOC that includes such tissue would act as a source of continued hCG production, leading to a plateau or a much slower than expected decline in serum levels. The patient's hCG levels show a consistent and rapid decline: from $24$ IU/L on day $10$ to $11$ IU/L on day $14$, and to $5$ IU/L on day $17$. This trend is fully compatible with the physiological clearance of hCG from the maternal circulation following placental delivery. The final measured value of $5$ IU/L is at the threshold for a negative test. This laboratory finding strongly argues against the presence of viable RPOC.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Ultrasound Morphology:** Transvaginal ultrasound reveals an intracavitary lesion that is $1.3$ cm, echogenic, has smooth margins, and is attached to the endometrium by a slender stalk. This is the classic morphological description of an endometrial polyp. RPOC, by contrast, is typically characterized by an irregularly shaped, heterogeneous echogenic mass with a broad base of endometrial attachment and no well-defined stalk. The uterine cavity is otherwise normal, with a uterus showing appropriate involution and an endometrial echo complex (EEC) of $9$ mm, which is not pathologically thickened.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Color Doppler Findings:** This is a key distinguishing feature. The observation of a \"single, discrete feeding vessel entering the lesion’s pedicle\" is the pathognomonic \"pedicle artery sign\" or \"single-feeder vessel\" sign. This finding is highly specific for an endometrial polyp, which is supplied by a single artery running through its stalk. In contrast, RPOC, being residual placental tissue, is typically highly vascularized and demonstrates multiple, chaotic vessels with low-resistance, high-velocity flow *within* the mass. The finding of \"minimal background endometrial vascularity\" also argues against a diffuse process like endometritis or widespread retained tissue.\n\n4.  **Synthesis and Diagnosis:** The combination of a physiological decline in $\\beta$-hCG, the classic polypoid morphology on ultrasound, and the pathognomonic single feeding vessel on color Doppler provides overwhelming evidence for a diagnosis of an endometrial polyp. This polyp may have been pre-existing and became more prominent or symptomatic due to postpartum hormonal changes and uterine involution.\n\n5.  **Management Strategy:** The patient's symptoms (intermittent bleeding, mild cramping) are not life-threatening.\n    -   **Expectant Management:** Given the mild nature of the symptoms, a period of observation is a valid initial approach to see if the bleeding resolves as the uterus continues to involute.\n    -   **Surgical Intervention:** If bleeding persists or worsens, removal is indicated. The gold standard for removing a focal lesion like a polyp is **hysteroscopic polypectomy**. This procedure allows for direct visualization of the polyp and its stalk, ensuring complete and targeted removal while preserving the surrounding healthy endometrium. This is particularly important in the postpartum uterus, which is more susceptible to injury. Office hysteroscopy is a feasible option for a small, accessible lesion like this.\n    -   **Contraindicated Procedures:** **Blind dilation and curettage (D&C)** is an outdated and unsafe approach for this diagnosis. It has a high miss rate for focal lesions (the curette can simply push the polyp aside) and carries a substantial risk of uterine perforation and the formation of intrauterine adhesions (Asherman syndrome), which can compromise future fertility.\n\n**Conclusion:** The diagnosis is an endometrial polyp. The appropriate management is expectant observation or hysteroscopic polypectomy, with a strict avoidance of blind D&C.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The vascular “single feeding vessel” pedicle sign and a steadily declining serum $\\beta$-hCG trend toward $< 5$ IU/L favor an endometrial polyp; manage with expectant observation or targeted office hysteroscopic polypectomy if bleeding persists, avoiding blind curettage.**\nThis option correctly identifies the two crucial diagnostic findings: the single feeding vessel on Doppler and the physiological decline of $\\beta$-hCG. It correctly concludes that these favor an endometrial polyp. The proposed management strategy is entirely correct and follows the standard of care: initial observation for mild symptoms, with hysteroscopic polypectomy as the definitive treatment if needed. Crticially, it correctly warns against the use of blind curettage.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Diffuse, centrally heterogeneous vascularity and the expectation that serum $\\beta$-hCG must be undetectable by day $7$ postpartum together confirm RPOC; manage with urgent blind suction curettage.**\nThis option is incorrect on multiple points. The patient's ultrasound showed a single feeding vessel, not \"diffuse, centrally heterogeneous vascularity.\" The expectation that $\\beta$-hCG *must* be undetectable by day $7$ is too stringent; it often takes $2-4$ weeks. The diagnosis of RPOC is incorrect. The management with \"urgent blind suction curettage\" is both unnecessary and dangerous.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Plateauing or rising serum $\\beta$-hCG with an EEC $> 10$ mm and broad-based central vascularity define RPOC; manage with ultrasound-guided suction evacuation; these findings explain the current case.**\nThis option accurately describes features of RPOC but then incorrectly states that these findings explain the current case. The patient's $\\beta$-hCG was *declining*, the EEC was $9$ mm (not $> 10$ mm), and the vascularity was a single stalk vessel (not broad-based). The conclusion that the findings explain the case is false. The proposed management is for RPOC, which is the wrong diagnosis.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Avascular intracavitary debris with low-resistance myometrial flow at the placental bed and undetectable serum $\\beta$-hCG indicate subinvolution of the placental site; manage with uterotonics; these findings explain the current case.**\nThis option describes a different pathology (subinvolution of the placental site) and misrepresents the findings. The lesion was not \"avascular\"; it had a distinct feeding vessel. The $\\beta$-hCG was not \"undetectable\"; it was $5$ IU/L. The lesion was a well-defined polyp, not \"debris.\" The management with uterotonics is for atony/subinvolution and would not treat the polyp.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4433564"}, {"introduction": "Safe execution of hysteroscopic polypectomy requires diligent intraoperative monitoring, particularly of the fluid used for uterine distension.
