The agents mentioned (clomiphene citrate, letrozole) act by modulating this pathway. The use of a simplified linear model is a standard and valid technique in quantitative biology to approximate complex systems.\n- **Well-Posed**: The instructions to construct the model are explicit, leading to a determinable algebraic equation.

If the feedback term is $\\alpha \\cdot E_2 \\cdot FSH$, the term $\\alpha \\cdot E_2$ must be dimensionless for the equation to be dimensionally homogeneous. The units are $(\\mathrm{pg^{-1}mL}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{pg/mL})$, which correctly results in a dimensionless product.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, mathematically formalizable, internally consistent, and well-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be furnished.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the construction of a mathematical model for the steady-state level of follicle-stimulating hormone ($FSH$) based on the principle of balancing a basal drive with feedback inhibition.\n\nLet $FSH$ be the steady-state concentration of the hormone. The basal drive, which represents the production of $FSH$ in the absence of any inhibition, is given as $F_0$.\n\nThe inhibition is stated to be proportional to both the estradiol concentration, $E_2$, and the current $FSH$ level. We introduce a proportionality constant, $\\alpha$. Therefore, the total feedback inhibition term is given by $\\alpha \\cdot E_2 \\cdot FSH$.\n\nThe problem describes a balance between the basal drive and this feedback inhibition. In a steady state, the level of $FSH$ is determined by the basal drive reduced by the feedback inhibition. This can be formulated as an equation:\n$$FSH = F_0 - \\alpha \\cdot E_2 \\cdot FSH$$\nThis equation represents the steady-state condition where the hormone level is equal to its baseline production rate minus the amount suppressed by negative feedback.\n\nTo express $FSH$ as a function of the other parameters, we must solve this algebraic equation for $FSH$:\n$$FSH + \\alpha \\cdot E_2 \\cdot FSH = F_0$$\nFactoring out $FSH$ from the terms on the left-hand side:\n$$FSH (1 + \\alpha \\cdot E_2) = F_0$$\nIsolating $FSH$ yields the explicit model:\n$$FSH = \\frac{F_0}{1 + \\alpha \\cdot E_2}$$\nThis model correctly reflects the system's behavior: as $E_2$ increases, the denominator becomes larger, and $FSH$ decreases. In the absence of estradiol ($E_2=0$), the equation simplifies to $FSH = F_0$, consistent with the problem's definition of $F_0$.\n\nNext, we compute the fractional increase in $FSH$ when the estradiol level drops. Let the initial state be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final state by subscript $2$.\nThe initial state is characterized by $E_{2,1} = 200\\,\\mathrm{pg/mL}$. The corresponding $FSH$ level is:\n$$FSH_1 = \\frac{F_0}{1 + \\alpha \\cdot E_{2,1}}$$\nThe final state is characterized by $E_{2,2} = 100\\,\\mathrm{pg/mL}$. The corresponding $FSH$ level is:\n$$FSH_2 = \\frac{F_0}{1 + \\alpha \\cdot E_{2,2}}$$\nThe fractional increase in $FSH$ is defined as the change in $FSH$ divided by the initial $FSH$ level:\n$$\\text{Fractional Increase} = \\frac{FSH_2 - FSH_1}{FSH_1} = \\frac{FSH_2}{FSH_1} - 1$$\nWe first compute the ratio $\\frac{FSH_2}{FSH_1}$:\n$$\\frac{FSH_2}{FSH_1} = \\frac{\\frac{F_0}{1 + \\alpha \\cdot E_{2,2}}}{\\frac{F_0}{1 + \\alpha \\cdot E_{2,1}}}$$\nThe basal drive term $F_0$ cancels, as anticipated:\n$$\\frac{FSH_2}{FSH_1} = \\frac{1 + \\alpha \\cdot E_{2,1}}{1 + \\alpha \\cdot E_{2,2}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $\\alpha = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{pg^{-1}mL}$, $E_{2,1} = 200\\,\\mathrm{pg/mL}$, and $E_{2,2} = 100\\,\\mathrm{pg/mL}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the dimensionless products $\\alpha \\cdot E_{2,1}$ and $\\alpha \\cdot E_{2,2}$:\n$$\\alpha \\cdot E_{2,1} = 0.01 \\times 200 = 2$$\n$$\\alpha \\cdot E_{2,2} = 0.01 \\times 100 = 1$$\nSubstitute these values back into the expression for the ratio:\n$$\\frac{FSH_2}{FSH_1} = \\frac{1 + 2}{1 + 1} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$$\nFinally, calculate the fractional increase:\n$$\\text{Fractional Increase} = \\frac{FSH_2}{FSH_1} - 1 = 1.5 - 1 = 0.5$$\nThis represents a $50\\%$ increase in the steady-state $FSH$ level as a consequence of the specified reduction in estradiol concentration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5}$$", "id": "4482369"}, {"introduction": "After stimulating the HPO axis, the next step is to monitor the ovarian response.

The problem states that $X$ is uniformly distributed on the interval $[150, 200]$. We denote this as $X \\sim U(a, b)$, where the lower bound of the interval is $a=150$ and the upper bound is $b=200$.\n\nThe expected value, $E[X]$, of a continuous random variable $X$ that is uniformly distributed on an interval $[a, b]$ is given by the formula for the mean of the distribution:\n$$E[X] = \\frac{a+b}{2}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values for $a$ and $b$:\n$$E[X] = \\frac{150 + 200}{2} = \\frac{350}{2} = 175$$\nThus, the expected $E2$ contribution from a single $18$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ follicle is $175$ $\\mathrm{pg/mL}$.\n\nThere are $2$ such mature follicles present. Let their individual $E2$ contributions be represented by the random variables $X_1$ and $X_2$. Based on the problem statement, these contributions are independent. As they originate from follicles of the same size class under identical physiological conditions, we model them as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. Consequently, both $X_1$ and $X_2$ have the same distribution as $X$, and their expected values are equal:\n$$E[X_1] = E[X_2] = E[X] = 175$$\nThe total serum $E2$ concentration, which we will denote as $E_{total}$, is the sum of the contributions from the two follicles:\n$$E_{total} = X_1 + X_2$$\nTo find the expected total serum $E2$ concentration, we must compute the expected value of $E_{total}$. A fundamental property of the expectation operator is its linearity. The expectation of a sum of random variables is equal to the sum of their individual expectations. This principle applies whether the random variables are independent or not.\n$$E[E_{total}] = E[X_1 + X_2]$$\nApplying the linearity of expectation:\n$$E[E_{total}] = E[X_1] + E[X_2]$$\nWe can now substitute the calculated expected value for each follicle:\n$$E[E_{total}] = 175 + 175 = 350$$\nThe expected total serum $E2$ concentration is therefore $350$ $\\mathrm{pg/mL}$.\n\nFinally, the problem specifies that the final numerical answer must be rounded to $3$ significant figures.
