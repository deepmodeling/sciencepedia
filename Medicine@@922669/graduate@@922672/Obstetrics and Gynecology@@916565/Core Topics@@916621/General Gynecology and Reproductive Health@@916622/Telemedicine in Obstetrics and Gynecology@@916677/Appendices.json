Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a structured, proactive method for identifying and prioritizing these risks before they lead to harm. In this practice, you will use the core FMEA components—Severity ($S$), Occurrence ($O$), and Detection ($D$)—to calculate a Risk Priority Number ($RPN$) and prioritize safety interventions in a remote monitoring program [@problem_id:4516584].", "problem": "A tertiary obstetrics practice with an existing telemedicine program is expanding remote Blood Pressure (BP) monitoring for patients at elevated risk of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (HDP). To proactively identify and prioritize risks, the practice performs a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) of the monitoring workflow. The intent is to compute the Risk Priority Number (RPN) for each identified failure mode following standard FMEA principles, without relying on any shortcut formulas that are not derived from first principles.\n\nFundamental base and setup:\n- In FMEA, the composite risk for a failure mode is assessed by three ordinal ratings: severity, occurrence, and detection. The severity rating reflects the magnitude of harm to the pregnant patient and fetus if the failure mode leads to an adverse effect. The occurrence rating reflects how frequently the failure mode is expected to occur within the remote monitoring process. The detection rating reflects how likely the system is to identify the failure before causing harm; higher ratings mean poorer detectability.\n- Each rating uses a ten-level ordinal scale from $1$ to $10$ with $1$ representing the least concerning end and $10$ representing the most concerning end along its axis. For severity, $1$ means negligible harm while $10$ means catastrophic maternal-fetal harm. For occurrence, $1$ means remote likelihood while $10$ means frequent recurrence. For detection, $1$ means the failure mode is almost certainly detected before harm while $10$ means the failure mode is very unlikely to be detected before harm.\n- The program implements a set of controls designed to either reduce the likelihood of occurrence or improve detectability prior to harm. These controls are applied to the baseline ratings to obtain adjusted ratings that reflect the system after control implementation.\n\nA clinical-risk team has identified the following failure modes in the remote BP monitoring workflow for pregnant patients, each with baseline ratings and the specified control effects. After the controls are implemented, compute the adjusted Risk Priority Numbers for each failure mode, reported in the order given below.\n\nFailure modes and ratings:\n(a) Incorrect cuff size selection by the patient (small cuff on a large arm) leads to systematically elevated BP readings and potential inappropriate interventions. Baseline ratings: severity $S_{a} = 6$, occurrence $O_{a} = 5$, detection $D_{a} = 6$. Control effects: patient-facing arm-circumference guidance and training reduce occurrence by $1$ point and detection rating by $2$ points, so adjusted ratings are $O_{a}^{\\prime} = O_{a} - 1$ and $D_{a}^{\\prime} = D_{a} - 2$ with a lower bound of $1$ on adjusted ratings.\n(b) Data transmission dropout from the home BP device results in missed severe-range readings. Baseline ratings: severity $S_{b} = 9$, occurrence $O_{b} = 3$, detection $D_{b} = 8$. Control effects: automated connectivity health monitoring reduces the detection rating by $3$ points, so $D_{b}^{\\prime} = D_{b} - 3$ with a lower bound of $1$; occurrence is unchanged.\n(c) Measurement taken shortly after caffeine intake causes transient elevation and false alarms. Baseline ratings: severity $S_{c} = 5$, occurrence $O_{c} = 6$, detection $D_{c} = 5$. Control effects: targeted education about pre-measurement conditions reduces occurrence by $2$ points, so $O_{c}^{\\prime} = O_{c} - 2$ with a lower bound of $1$; detection is unchanged.\n(d) Alert routing misconfiguration causes delayed clinician review of critical BP alerts. Baseline ratings: severity $S_{d} = 8$, occurrence $O_{d} = 2$, detection $D_{d} = 7$. Control effects: weekly alert routing audits and redundant notification channels reduce occurrence by $1$ point and detection rating by $4$ points, so $O_{d}^{\\prime} = O_{d} - 1$ and $D_{d}^{\\prime} = D_{d} - 4$ with a lower bound of $1$ on adjusted ratings.\n\nTask:\n- Using the foundational FMEA rationale for combining severity, occurrence, and detection into a composite prioritization metric, compute the adjusted Risk Priority Number for each failure mode after the specified controls are implemented.\n- Report the final four adjusted RPN values in the order $(a), (b), (c), (d)$.\n- Express the final answer as an ordered row matrix of four integers, with no units.

You are asked to estimate the expected patient savings per TM visit (accounting for travel-related out-of-pocket costs and the economic value of time) and extrapolate to the clinic’s annual patient savings, grounded in first principles: travel time equals distance divided by speed, round-trip distance is twice the one-way distance, and expected value is computed by averaging over a mixture of subpopulations and distributions.\n\nAssume the clinic serves $N = 2400$ prenatal patients per year. A typical prenatal schedule consists of $V = 14$ visits per patient. Of all patients, a fraction $p_{L} = 0.60$ are low-risk and $p_{H} = 0.40$ are high-risk. The clinic converts a fraction of visits to TM equal to $f_{L} = 0.25$ for low-risk and $f_{H} = 0.10$ for high-risk patients.\n\nPatients belong to one of three geographic subpopulations, assumed independent of risk category and employment status, with probabilities $q_{U} = 0.50$ (urban), $q_{S} = 0.20$ (suburban), and $q_{R} = 0.30$ (rural).

In-person visits incur a parking cost $P$ equal to $6$ with probability $0.70$ and $0$ otherwise; Telemedicine visits incur no parking cost. In-person waiting time $W_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is modeled as exponentially distributed with mean $20$ minutes; Telemedicine waiting time $W_{\\mathrm{tm}}$ has mean $8$ minutes.
