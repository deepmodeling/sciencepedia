This corresponds to a solute mass $m_{supply} = 20$ g and a solution volume $V_{supply} = 500$ mL.\n- Required calculation: Determine the volume to be drawn from the supplied bag, $V_{dose}$, to obtain the loading dose.\n- Constraints: Use the definition of mass concentration and conservation of mass.

The use of magnesium sulfate for fetal neuroprotection in pregnancies at risk for preterm birth before 32 weeks of gestation is a well-established, evidence-based intervention in obstetrics. The dosages and concentrations given (6 g loading dose, 20 g in 500 mL solution) are clinically realistic. The underlying physical principle is the definition of mass concentration, a fundamental concept in chemistry. The problem is factually and scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information to calculate the required volume. There are no contradictions, and a unique, stable solution exists.

Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core of this problem lies in the concept of mass concentration, which we denote by $\\rho$. Mass concentration is defined as the mass of a solute, $m$, per unit volume of the total solution, $V$.\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{m}{V}\n$$\nThe pharmacy supplies a premixed bag of magnesium sulfate solution. Let the mass of the magnesium sulfate in this supply bag be $m_{supply}$ and the total volume of the solution be $V_{supply}$. According to the problem statement, we have:\n$$\nm_{supply} = 20 \\text{ g}\n$$\n$$\nV_{supply} = 500 \\text{ mL}\n$$\nThe mass concentration of the supplied solution, $\\rho_{supply}$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\rho_{supply} = \\frac{m_{supply}}{V_{supply}} = \\frac{20 \\text{ g}}{500 \\text{ mL}}\n$$\nThe problem requires administering a specific mass of magnesium sulfate as a loading dose, which we denote as $m_{dose}$.\n$$\nm_{dose} = 6 \\text{ g}\n$$\nWe need to determine the volume of solution, $V_{dose}$, that must be drawn from the supply bag to obtain this mass. The principle of conservation of mass, and the fact that no dilution occurs, dictates that the concentration of the solution drawn from the bag is identical to the concentration of the solution within the bag. Thus, the concentration of the dose volume is equal to the concentration of the supply solution.\n$$\n\\rho_{dose} = \\rho_{supply}\n$$\nUsing the definition of concentration for the dose to be administered, we have:\n$$\n\\rho_{dose} = \\frac{m_{dose}}{V_{dose}}\n$$\nBy equating the concentrations, we establish the central relationship for solving the problem:\n$$\n\\frac{m_{dose}}{V_{dose}} = \\frac{m_{supply}}{V_{supply}}\n$$\nOur objective is to find $V_{dose}$. We can rearrange the equation algebraically to solve for $V_{dose}$:\n$$\nV_{dose} = m_{dose} \\cdot \\frac{V_{supply}}{m_{supply}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$$\nm_{dose} = 6 \\text{ g}\n$$\n$$\nV_{supply} = 500 \\text{ mL}\n$$\n$$\nm_{supply} = 20 \\text{ g}\n$$\nThe calculation for $V_{dose}$ is as follows:\n$$\nV_{dose} = 6 \\text{ g} \\times \\frac{500 \\text{ mL}}{20 \\text{ g}}\n$$\nThe units of grams (g) in the numerator and denominator cancel, leaving the result in units of milliliters (mL), which is dimensionally correct.\n$$\nV_{dose} = \\frac{6 \\times 500}{20} \\text{ mL}\n$$\n$$\nV_{dose} = \\frac{3000}{20} \\text{ mL}\n$$\n$$\nV_{dose} = \\frac{300}{2} \\text{ mL}\n$$\n$$\nV_{dose} = 150 \\text{ mL}\n$$\nThus, a volume of 150 mL must be drawn from the supplied bag to deliver the required 6 g loading dose of magnesium sulfate.

Magnesium sulfate is widely used in obstetrics for both pre-eclampsia seizure prophylaxis and, as stated, for fetal neuroprotection in anticipated preterm birth before 32 weeks of gestation. A primary mechanism of action is the blockade of neuromuscular transmission. Magnesium ions ($Mg^{2+}$) act as a calcium antagonist at the presynaptic nerve terminal, inhibiting the release of acetylcholine. At therapeutic concentrations, this effect is minimal, but at toxic supratherapeutic levels (hypermagnesemia), it can lead to progressive loss of deep tendon reflexes, followed by respiratory depression and, ultimately, respiratory and cardiac arrest. The clinical signs presented—unresponsiveness, apnea, and absent patellar reflexes—are the classic textbook presentation of severe magnesium toxicity. The treatment for this condition, involving supportive care and the administration of a calcium salt as a direct antagonist, is also well-established. The scenario is entirely plausible and grounded in well-understood principles of pharmacology and physiology.\n\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear clinical scenario and asks for the immediate sequence of management steps, based on foundational emergency principles (Airway-Breathing-Circulation) and specific pharmacologic knowledge. A single best course of action can be determined from established clinical guidelines.\n\n- **Objective (Critical)**: The problem uses objective clinical language, providing specific vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, SpO2) and physical exam findings (unresponsive, apneic, absent reflexes). It avoids subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and presents a realistic clinical challenge. I will proceed with a solution.\n\n### Derivation of Correct Management\nThe patient is experiencing a life-threatening emergency: respiratory arrest secondary to iatrogenic magnesium toxicity. Management must follow the hierarchical priorities of resuscitation, commonly known as the ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation), while simultaneously addressing the underlying cause.\n\n1.  **A (Airway) and B (Breathing)**: The patient is apneic (not breathing) and hypoxic (SpO2 is 82% and falling). This is the most immediate threat to life for both the mother and the fetus. The first and most critical action is to restore ventilation and oxygenation. For an apneic patient, passive oxygen administration (via nasal cannula or nonrebreather mask) is futile. Positive pressure ventilation is required. The most rapid initial method is bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation, using 100% supplemental oxygen. Simultaneously, help must be summoned to bring additional personnel and equipment (e.g., a \"code blue\" team, anesthesiology). Preparations for a definitive airway (endotracheal intubation) should be made, as BVM is a temporizing measure.\n\n2.  **C (Circulation)**: The patient has a palpable pulse of 90 bpm and a blood pressure of 120/75 mm Hg. Circulation is currently intact. The primary insult is respiratory, not cardiac. Untreated respiratory arrest will inevitably lead to hypoxic cardiac arrest, but the immediate problem to solve is breathing.\n\n3.  **D (Disability/Definitive Treatment)**: The clear etiology is magnesium toxicity. The management plan must therefore include:\n    a.  **Stopping the offending agent**: The magnesium sulfate infusion must be discontinued immediately.\n    b.  **Administering the antidote**: The pharmacologic effects of magnesium at the neuromuscular junction are antagonized by calcium. The standard antidote is a calcium salt.\n        - **Choice of agent**: Calcium gluconate is preferred for peripheral IV administration over calcium chloride because it is less caustic and has a lower risk of severe tissue injury and necrosis upon extravasation. The problem states only a peripheral IV is available.\n        - **Dose and Administration**: The standard dose is 1 gram of calcium gluconate, which corresponds to 10 mL of a 10% solution. To avoid potential cardiac side effects like bradycardia or arrhythmia, it must be administered slowly, typically over 2 to 5 minutes.\n\n4.  **E (Exposure/Evaluation)**: A blood sample should be sent for a stat serum magnesium level. This will confirm the diagnosis and quantify the degree of toxicity, which can guide further management (e.g., if a repeat dose of calcium or dialysis is needed). However, treatment must *not* be delayed while awaiting this result; it is a clinical diagnosis requiring immediate intervention.\n\nIn summary, the correct sequence of immediate actions is: call for help, start BVM ventilation with 100% oxygen, stop the magnesium infusion, administer 1 gram of calcium gluconate IV slowly, and prepare for intubation if respiratory effort does not promptly return.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Reduce the magnesium infusion rate by 50%, apply 4 L/min oxygen via nasal cannula, administer naloxone IV, place the patient in the left lateral decubitus position, and observe for improvement before further intervention.**\n- **Reduce magnesium infusion**: Incorrect. In the setting of respiratory arrest, the infusion must be stopped entirely, not merely reduced.\n- **Nasal cannula**: Incorrect. The patient is apneic. Supplying oxygen to the nares of a non-breathing patient is useless. Assisted ventilation is mandatory.\n- **Administer naloxone**: Incorrect. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist. The problem explicitly states no known opioid exposure, and the clinical signs are classic for hypermagnesemia, not opioid toxicity.\n- **Observe for improvement**: Incorrect. This is a state of active respiratory arrest. Observation is malpractice; immediate, aggressive intervention is required.\nVerdict on A: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Call for help and initiate bag–valve–mask ventilation with 100% oxygen, stop the magnesium infusion, administer calcium gluconate 10 mL of 10% solution (i.e., 1 g) IV slowly over 2 to 5 minutes via the existing peripheral line, reassess respiratory effort and prepare for endotracheal intubation if ventilation remains inadequate, and send a serum magnesium level to guide any later consideration of restarting therapy.**\n- **Call for help**: Correct. This is a fundamental first step in any medical emergency.\n- **BVM ventilation with 100% O2**: Correct. This immediately addresses the life-threatening apnea and hypoxia (the 'A' and 'B' of ABCs).\n- **Stop the magnesium infusion**: Correct. This removes the causative agent.\n- **Administer calcium gluconate 1 g IV slowly**: Correct. This is the appropriate antidote, agent (for peripheral line), dose, and rate of administration.\n- **Reassess and prepare for intubation**: Correct. This reflects sound emergency practice, anticipating the need for escalation to a definitive airway.\n- **Send serum magnesium level**: Correct. This is the appropriate diagnostic step, performed concurrently with or immediately after initiating life-saving treatment.\nVerdict on B: **Correct**. This sequence perfectly aligns with the principles of emergency resuscitation for this specific clinical scenario.\n\n**C. Rapidly administer calcium chloride 10% 10 mL IV through the peripheral line, continue the magnesium infusion to maintain fetal neuroprotection, place a nonrebreather mask at 15 L/min, and defer assisted ventilation to avoid gastric insufflation.**\n- **Rapidly administer calcium chloride via peripheral line**: Incorrect and dangerous. Calcium chloride is highly vesicant and poses a significant risk of tissue necrosis with peripheral administration. Rapid administration can also cause cardiac arrhythmias. Calcium gluconate is the preferred agent.\n- **Continue magnesium infusion**: Gravely incorrect. The infusion is killing the patient. Maternal survival is the absolute prerequisite for fetal survival.\n- **Nonrebreather mask**: Incorrect. The patient is apneic and cannot be oxygenated with a device that requires spontaneous breathing.\n- **Defer assisted ventilation**: Gravely incorrect. Withholding ventilation from an apneic patient is fatal. The risk of gastric insufflation is managed with technique, not by withholding life-saving intervention.\nVerdict on C: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Administer protamine sulfate IV and furosemide, place the patient prone to optimize ventilation, and wait 15 minutes while obtaining an arterial blood gas before making changes to the magnesium infusion.**\n- **Protamine sulfate**: Incorrect. This is the antidote for heparin, not magnesium.\n- **Furosemide**: Incorrect. While forced diuresis can enhance magnesium excretion, it is not a first-line treatment for acute, life-threatening respiratory arrest. Ventilation and calcium are paramount.\n- **Place the patient prone**: Incorrect. Prone positioning is a strategy for established ARDS, not an initial maneuver in a code situation. It severely hinders airway access for BVM and intubation.\n- **Wait 15 minutes**: Gravely incorrect. A 15-minute delay in treating apnea will result in severe hypoxic brain injury or death.\nVerdict on D: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Proceed with emergent cesarean delivery to remove the fetus from magnesium exposure, then address the maternal apnea after delivery, avoiding antidotes that could cross the placenta.**\n- **Proceed with emergent C-delivery**: Gravely incorrect. Performing major surgery on a hemodynamically unstable, apneic patient is contraindicated and would likely be fatal. The principle of maternal-fetal medicine is to resuscitate and stabilize the mother first, as this is the best way to protect the fetus.\n- **Address apnea after delivery**: Gravely incorrect. Maternal apnea must be addressed immediately to prevent maternal death.\n- **Avoiding antidotes**: Incorrect. The priority is saving the mother's life. Concerns about placental transfer of calcium (a normal body electrolyte) are completely secondary to treating a life-threatening maternal condition.\nVerdict on E: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4463656"}]}
