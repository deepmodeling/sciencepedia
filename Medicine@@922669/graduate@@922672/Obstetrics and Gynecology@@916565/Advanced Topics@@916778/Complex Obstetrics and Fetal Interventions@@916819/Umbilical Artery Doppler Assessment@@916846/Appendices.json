This optimization is governed by the Doppler equation and the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem.\n\n**1. Doppler Frequency Shift Calculation**\n\nThe Doppler frequency shift, $f_D$, for blood flowing at velocity $v$ is given by the Doppler equation:\n$$f_D = \\frac{2 f_0 v \\cos\\theta}{c}$$\nwhere $f_0$ is the transducer's center frequency, $c$ is the speed of sound in the medium, and $\\theta$ is the angle between the ultrasound beam and the direction of blood flow.\n\nUsing the given values:\n- $f_0 = 3.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{Hz}$\n- $c = 1540\\,\\text{m/s}$\n- $\\theta = 30^\\circ$, so $\\cos(30^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.866$\n\nFirst, we calculate the expected Doppler shift for the peak systolic velocity ($v_{sys}$) to determine the minimum required PRF to avoid aliasing.\n$$f_{D,sys} = \\frac{2 \\times (3.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{Hz}) \\times (0.65\\,\\text{m/s}) \\times \\cos(30^\\circ)}{1540\\,\\text{m/s}}$$\n$$f_{D,sys} \\approx \\frac{(7 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{Hz}) \\times (0.65\\,\\text{m/s}) \\times 0.866}{1540\\,\\text{m/s}} \\approx \\frac{3940195\\,\\text{Hz}\\cdot\\text{m/s}}{1540\\,\\text{m/s}} \\approx 2558.6\\,\\text{Hz}$$\nSo, the maximum expected frequency is approximately $f_{D,sys} \\approx 2.6\\,\\text{kHz}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the Doppler shift for the end-diastolic velocity ($v_{edv}$) to determine an appropriate wall filter setting.\n$$f_{D,edv} = \\frac{2 \\times (3.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{Hz}) \\times (0.04\\,\\text{m/s}) \\times \\cos(30^\\circ)}{1540\\,\\text{m/s}}$$\n$$f_{D,edv} \\approx \\frac{(7 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{Hz}) \\times (0.04\\,\\text{m/s}) \\times 0.866}{1540\\,\\text{m/s}} \\approx \\frac{242473\\,\\text{Hz}\\cdot\\text{m/s}}{1540\\,\\text{m/s}} \\approx 157.4\\,\\text{Hz}$$\nThe low-frequency signal of interest is approximately $f_{D,edv} \\approx 157\\,\\text{Hz}$.\n\n**2. Parameter Optimization**\n\n- **Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF):** According to the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem, to avoid aliasing, the sampling rate (PRF) must be at least twice the maximum frequency present in the signal.\n  $$PRF \\ge 2 \\times f_{D,max}$$\n  In this case, $f_{D,max} = f_{D,sys} \\approx 2559\\,\\text{Hz}$.\n  $$PRF \\ge 2 \\times 2559\\,\\text{Hz} = 5118\\,\\text{Hz} \\approx 5.1\\,\\text{kHz}$$\n  Therefore, the PRF must be set above $5.1\\,\\text{kHz}$ to unambiguously measure the peak systolic velocity.\n\n- **Wall Filter:** The wall filter is a high-pass filter used to eliminate low-frequency, high-amplitude \"clutter\" signals from slow-moving or stationary structures like vessel walls. To achieve the goal of visualizing the low end-diastolic flow, the filter's cutoff frequency must be set below the frequency of the diastolic signal, $f_{D,edv} \\approx 157\\,\\text{Hz}$. Setting it too high would remove the signal of interest. Setting it too low (e.g., $ 30-50\\,\\text{Hz}$) may fail to remove sufficient clutter, which can obscure the weak diastolic signal. A cutoff in the range of $50\\,\\text{Hz}$ to $100\\,\\text{Hz}$ is typically a good compromise.\n\n- **Receiver Gain:** The gain amplifies the returning echo signals. To visualize weak signals like the low-velocity diastolic flow, the gain must be high enough. However, excessive gain amplifies noise, degrading the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and potentially obscuring the waveform. The optimal technique is to increase gain until background noise just becomes visible on the spectral display, and then reduce it slightly so the noise floor is just below the baseline. This ensures maximum sensitivity for weak signals without overwhelming the display with noise.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A. PRF set to $6\\,\\text{kHz}$; receiver gain increased until weak blood signals are visible and then adjusted slightly down to keep the noise floor just below the spectral trace; wall filter cutoff set to $50\\,\\text{Hz}$.**\n  - **PRF:** A PRF of $6\\,\\text{kHz}$ is greater than the required minimum of $\\approx 5.1\\,\\text{kHz}$. This setting will successfully avoid aliasing of the systolic peak.\n  - **Gain:** The described gain setting is the textbook definition of optimal gain adjustment for maximizing the visibility of weak signals while maintaining a good SNR.\n  - **Wall Filter:** A cutoff of $50\\,\\text{Hz}$ is well below the expected diastolic frequency of $\\approx 157\\,\\text{Hz}$.

This will cause severe aliasing of the systolic peak, making the waveform uninterpretable. The Nyquist limit is only $1\\,\\text{kHz}$.\n  - **Gain:** Setting gain high enough for noise to be prominent is a suboptimal technique that reduces SNR.\n  - **Wall Filter:** A cutoff of $300\\,\\text{Hz}$ is significantly higher than the expected diastolic frequency of $\\approx 157\\,\\text{Hz}$. This filter would completely eliminate the end-diastolic flow information, which is contrary to the stated goal.\n  - **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. All three parameter settings are inappropriate.\n\n- **C. PRF set to $10\\,\\text{kHz}$; receiver gain set low to suppress noise even if weak blood signals are lost; wall filter cutoff set to $25\\,\\text{Hz}$.**\n  - **PRF:** A PRF of $10\\,\\text{kHz}$ is well above the required minimum, so it avoids aliasing. While a very high PRF may have other trade-offs (e.g., reduced sensitivity), it is a valid choice in this regard.\n  - **Gain:** The strategy of setting gain low to the point of losing weak signals is explicitly counterproductive to the goal of visualizing low end-diastolic flow.\n  - **Wall Filter:** A cutoff of $25\\,\\text{Hz}$ is excellent for preserving the diastolic signal but may be less effective at removing wall clutter compared to $50\\,\\text{Hz}$. However, the primary flaw in this option is the gain setting.\n  - **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The gain setting is fundamentally wrong for the task.\n\n- **D. PRF set to $5\\,\\text{kHz}$; receiver gain increased until weak blood signals are visible and then adjusted slightly down to keep the noise floor just below the spectral trace; wall filter cutoff set to $150\\,\\text{Hz}$.**\n  - **PRF:** A PRF of $5\\,\\text{kHz}$ is below the calculated minimum requirement of $\\approx 5.1\\,\\text{kHz}$. The Nyquist limit would be $2.5\\,\\text{kHz}$, which is less than the expected systolic frequency of $\\approx 2.6\\,\\text{kHz}$. This will cause aliasing (the peak of the systolic waveform will be \"cut off\" and \"wrap around\").\n  - **Gain:** The described gain setting is optimal.\n  - **Wall Filter:** A cutoff of $150\\,\\text{Hz}$ is almost exactly at the expected diastolic frequency of $\\approx 157\\,\\text{Hz}$. A high-pass filter set at this level would severely attenuate or completely remove the signal from the end-diastolic flow.\n  - **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The PRF is too low and the wall filter cutoff is too high.\n\nBased on this analysis, option A is the only choice that appropriately balances all technical requirements to meet the clinical objective.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4519350"}]}
