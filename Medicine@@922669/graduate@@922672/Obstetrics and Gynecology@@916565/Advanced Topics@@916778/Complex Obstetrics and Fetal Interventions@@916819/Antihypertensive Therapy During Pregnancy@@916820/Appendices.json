To avoid \"dose stacking,\" a **minimum re-assessment interval of $15$ to $20$ minutes** is justified, allowing the clinician to observe most of the effect from a given rate before increasing it.

This problem focuses on the common and clinically vital scenario of co-administering nifedipine and magnesium sulfate, forcing you to weigh evidence-based benefits against potential risks [@problem_id:4403757]. Solving this requires you to integrate knowledge of pharmacology, patient monitoring, and emergency response, cornerstones of safe and effective obstetric care.", "problem": "A gravida $2$, para $1$ patient at $32$ weeks of gestation presents with severe features of preeclampsia. Her blood pressure is persistently $170/110$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ despite appropriate positioning and prior intravenous labetalol, and she is started on magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis. Her magnesium sulfate regimen is a loading dose followed by continuous infusion, and her current respiratory rate (RR) is $16$ breaths per minute with intact deep tendon reflexes. You are considering immediate-release oral nifedipine $10$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ for acute blood pressure control.\n\nUse the following fundamental bases to reason about coadministration risks and monitoring:\n- Hemodynamic relationship: mean arterial pressure ($MAP$) is related to cardiac output ($CO$) and systemic vascular resistance ($SVR$) by $MAP \\approx CO \\times SVR$.\n- Vascular smooth muscle contraction depends on intracellular calcium ($\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$) influx through L-type channels; dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., nifedipine) reduce $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx in vascular smooth muscle, thereby decreasing $SVR$.\n- Magnesium sulfate acts as a physiologic calcium antagonist at the neuromuscular junction and has vasodilatory effects that can also decrease $SVR$; magnesium toxicity manifests with loss of deep tendon reflexes, respiratory depression, and cardiac conduction abnormalities.\n- Rescue therapy for magnesium toxicity requires intravenous calcium to competitively overcome magnesium’s effects at the neuromuscular junction.\n\nWhich option best reflects evidence-based guidance regarding concomitant nifedipine and magnesium sulfate use in pregnancy, explicitly addressing hypotension risk, appropriate monitoring, and the correct rescue calcium gluconate dosing if needed?\n\nA. Concomitant nifedipine and magnesium sulfate are contraindicated due to a high risk of life-threatening neuromuscular blockade; magnesium should be stopped immediately, and any hypotension should be reversed with calcium chloride $10\\%$, $10$ $\\mathrm{mL}$ intravenous push via a peripheral line.\n\nB. Concomitant use is acceptable with vigilant monitoring because observational cohorts and guidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) do not show increased serious adverse maternal outcomes; additive vasodilation may lower $SVR$ and $MAP$, so monitor noninvasive blood pressure every $5$ to $10$ minutes initially, deep tendon reflexes hourly, RR, oxygen saturation, urine output, and serum magnesium as clinically indicated; if magnesium toxicity occurs (e.g., areflexia, RR $<12$), administer calcium gluconate $10\\%$, $10$ $\\mathrm{mL}$ ($1$ $\\mathrm{g}$) intravenously over $2$ to $5$ minutes, with supportive care.\n\nC. Concomitant use is acceptable only if the magnesium sulfate infusion is paused for $60$ minutes before nifedipine to prevent precipitous hypotension; if toxicity occurs, sodium bicarbonate should be given to reverse magnesium’s effects.\n\nD. Nifedipine should be avoided with magnesium sulfate because the combination is associated with fetal growth restriction; atenolol is preferred for acute severe hypertension, and magnesium toxicity should be managed by increasing intravenous fluids only.\n\nE. Concomitant use is safe without special monitoring because magnesium sulfate neutralizes nifedipine’s vascular effects; hypotension risk is negligible, and calcium gluconate is unnecessary even if reflexes are lost.", "solution": "Concomitant use of nifedipine and magnesium sulfate is acceptable and recommended by professional bodies like ACOG and SMFM, but it requires vigilant monitoring. The primary concern is an additive vasodilatory effect, as both drugs can decrease systemic vascular resistance ($SVR$), leading to a more profound drop in mean arterial pressure ($MAP$) and a risk of maternal hypotension. This necessitates close hemodynamic monitoring, especially frequent noninvasive blood pressure measurement (e.g., every $5-10$ minutes) after the nifedipine dose. Standard clinical monitoring for magnesium toxicity—including hourly assessment of respiratory rate (RR), deep tendon reflexes, and urine output—must continue. Although a theoretical risk of synergistic neuromuscular blockade exists, large-scale evidence has not shown this to be a common clinical problem. In the event of magnesium toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression with RR $\\lt 12$ breaths/min or areflexia), the specific and correct antidote is intravenous calcium gluconate $10\\%$, administered as a $10$ $\\mathrm{mL}$ ($1$ $\\mathrm{g}$) dose over $2-5$ minutes to competitively reverse the effects of magnesium. Option B correctly synthesizes this evidence-based guidance, balancing therapeutic benefit with the necessary safety protocols for monitoring and emergency preparedness.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4403757"}]}
