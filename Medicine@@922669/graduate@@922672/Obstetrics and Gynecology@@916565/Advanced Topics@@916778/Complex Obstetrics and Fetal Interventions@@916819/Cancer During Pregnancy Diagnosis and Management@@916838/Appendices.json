It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all necessary information is provided.

The solution to this differential equation is:\n$$ C(t) = C(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V} t\\right) = \\frac{D}{V} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V} t\\right) $$\nThe Area Under the Curve from time $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$, denoted AUC, is the integral of $C(t)$:\n$$ \\mathrm{AUC} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{D}{V} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V} t\\right) dt $$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$ \\mathrm{AUC} = \\frac{D}{V} \\left[ -\\frac{V}{CL} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V} t\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{AUC} = \\frac{D}{V} \\left( \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{V}{CL} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V} t\\right)\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{V}{CL} \\exp(0)\\right) \\right) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{AUC} = \\frac{D}{V} \\left( 0 + \\frac{V}{CL} \\right) = \\frac{D}{CL} $$\nThis derivation from first principles demonstrates that for a linear one-compartment model, the total AUC is solely dependent on the dose $D$ and the total clearance $CL$. **The apparent Volume of Distribution ($V$) cancels out and therefore does not affect the total AUC.** An increase in $V$, as seen in pregnancy, would lower the initial concentration $C(0)$ and decrease the elimination rate constant $k_e = CL/V$, but the integrated exposure, AUC, remains unchanged for a given dose and clearance.\n\nThe ratio of AUC in pregnancy (state $1$) to pre-pregnancy (state $0$), for the same dose $D$, is:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{AUC}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{1}}{\\mathrm{AUC}_{0}} = \\frac{D/CL_{1}}{D/CL_{0}} = \\frac{CL_{0}}{CL_{1}} $$\nThe total clearance $CL$ is the sum of renal ($CL_{\\mathrm{R}}$) and nonrenal ($CL_{\\mathrm{NR}}$) clearance, where $CL_{\\mathrm{R}} = f_{u}\\,\\mathrm{GFR}$.\nThe clearances in the two states are:\n$$ CL_{0} = CL_{\\mathrm{R},0} + CL_{\\mathrm{NR}} = f_{u,0}\\mathrm{GFR}_{0} + CL_{\\mathrm{NR}} $$\n$$ CL_{1} = CL_{\\mathrm{R},1} + CL_{\\mathrm{NR}} = f_{u,1}\\mathrm{GFR}_{1} + CL_{\\mathrm{NR}} $$\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for $R_{\\mathrm{AUC}}$ gives the final derived expression:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{AUC}} = \\frac{f_{u,0}\\mathrm{GFR}_{0} + CL_{\\mathrm{NR}}}{f_{u,1}\\mathrm{GFR}_{1} + CL_{\\mathrm{NR}}} $$\n\n**Task 2: Numerical Computation of $R_{\\mathrm{AUC}}$**\n\nFirst, ensure all clearance-related units are consistent. We will convert GFR from $\\mathrm{mL/min}$ to $\\mathrm{L/h}$.\nGiven: $\\mathrm{GFR}_{0} = 120\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$ and $CL_{\\mathrm{NR}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$.\n$$ \\mathrm{GFR}_{0} = 120\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{min}} \\times \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{min}}{1\\,\\mathrm{h}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{L}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{mL}} = 7.2\\,\\mathrm{L/h} $$\nNow, calculate the GFR during pregnancy:\n$$ \\mathrm{GFR}_{1} = 1.5 \\times \\mathrm{GFR}_{0} = 1.5 \\times 7.2\\,\\mathrm{L/h} = 10.8\\,\\mathrm{L/h} $$\nNext, calculate the total clearance for each state using the provided values for $f_u$:\n$$ CL_{0} = f_{u,0}\\mathrm{GFR}_{0} + CL_{\\mathrm{NR}} = (0.30)(7.2\\,\\mathrm{L/h}) + 0.5\\,\\mathrm{L/h} = 2.16\\,\\mathrm{L/h} + 0.5\\,\\mathrm{L/h} = 2.66\\,\\mathrm{L/h} $$\n$$ CL_{1} = f_{u,1}\\mathrm{GFR}_{1} + CL_{\\mathrm{NR}} = (0.40)(10.8\\,\\mathrm{L/h}) + 0.5\\,\\mathrm{L/h} = 4.32\\,\\mathrm{L/h} + 0.5\\,\\mathrm{L/h} = 4.82\\,\\mathrm{L/h} $$\nFinally, compute the ratio $R_{\\mathrm{AUC}}$:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{AUC}} = \\frac{CL_{0}}{CL_{1}} = \\frac{2.66\\,\\mathrm{L/h}}{4.82\\,\\mathrm{L/h}} \\approx 0.551867 $$\nThis result indicates that for the same dose, the drug exposure (AUC) during pregnancy is predicted to be approximately $55\\%$ of the pre-pregnancy exposure due to enhanced clearance.\n\n**Task 3: Dosing Plan and Dose Adjustment Factor ($F_{\\mathrm{dose}}$)**\n\nThe objective is to adjust the dose administered during pregnancy, $D_1$, to achieve the same target AUC as that obtained with the pre-pregnancy dose, $D_0$.\n$$ \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\text{target}} = \\mathrm{AUC}_{1} = \\mathrm{AUC}_{0} $$\nUsing the relationship $\\mathrm{AUC} = D/CL$:\n$$ \\frac{D_1}{CL_1} = \\frac{D_0}{CL_0} $$\nThe dose adjustment factor is defined as $F_{\\mathrm{dose}} = \\frac{D_1}{D_0}$. Rearranging the equation above yields the expression for this factor:\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{dose}} = \\frac{D_1}{D_0} = \\frac{CL_1}{CL_0} $$\nThe dose adjustment factor is the ratio of the total clearance in pregnancy to the pre-pregnancy clearance, which is the reciprocal of $R_{\\mathrm{AUC}}$. An initial dose for pregnancy should be set as $D_1 = F_{\\mathrm{dose}} \\times D_0$.\n\nUsing the clearance values calculated in Task $2$:\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{dose}} = \\frac{4.82\\,\\mathrm{L/h}}{2.66\\,\\mathrm{L/h}} \\approx 1.812030 $$\nRounded to four significant figures, the numerical value is $1.812$. This means the dose must be increased by approximately $81.2\\%$ to counteract the increased drug clearance during pregnancy and achieve the target exposure.\n\n**Role of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM):**\nThe initial dose adjustment $D_1 = F_{\\mathrm{dose}} \\times D_0$ is an evidence-based prediction founded on population-average physiological changes. However, significant inter-individual variability exists. TDM is essential to refine this initial dose. After administering the adjusted dose $D_1$, blood samples are collected over a dosing interval to measure the actual drug concentration profile. From these measurements, the patient's true $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\text{measured}}$ is calculated. This measured value is compared to the $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\text{target}}$. Subsequent doses can be refined using the principle of dose proportionality to correct any deviation, according to the relation: $D_{\\text{new}} = D_{\\text{current}} \\times (\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\text{target}} / \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\text{measured}})$.
