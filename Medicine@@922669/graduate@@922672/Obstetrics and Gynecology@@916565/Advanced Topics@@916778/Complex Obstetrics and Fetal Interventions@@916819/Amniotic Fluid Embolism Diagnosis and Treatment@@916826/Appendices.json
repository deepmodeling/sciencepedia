The clinical team suspects amniotic fluid embolism based on the sudden cardiopulmonary collapse and rapid evolution of coagulopathy. In disseminated intravascular coagulation, systemic activation of coagulation leads to consumption of platelets and fibrinogen and generation of fibrin degradation products; to quantify the severity of coagulopathy, an adapted scoring system from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) is commonly applied in pregnancy. You are provided the following laboratory values obtained within the first hour of decompensation: platelet count = $60,000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$, fibrin degradation products (FDP) are described as markedly elevated, prothrombin time (PT) is prolonged by $5\\,\\mathrm{s}$ compared with the laboratory control, and fibrinogen = $90\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. Using the ISTH disseminated intravascular coagulation scoring framework adapted for pregnancy, compute the total disseminated intravascular coagulation score from these inputs and interpret whether the score is consistent with overt disseminated intravascular coagulation. Report the score as an integer. No rounding is necessary, and no units are required for the score.", "solution": "The problem statement is deemed valid. It presents a clinically realistic scenario and provides a set of quantitative laboratory values. The task is to apply a standard, well-defined clinical scoring system, the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) score for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), to these data. The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded in established medical principles, and well-posed, admitting a unique integer solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the DIC score for a gravida $2$, para $1$ patient presenting with symptoms and laboratory findings suggestive of amniotic fluid embolism complicated by DIC. The scoring system provides a standardized, quantitative method for diagnosing overt DIC. The score is calculated by summing points assigned to abnormalities in four laboratory parameters: platelet count, a fibrin-related marker (such as fibrin degradation products, FDPs), prothrombin time (PT), and fibrinogen level.\n\nWe will calculate the score for each parameter based on the provided laboratory values and the ISTH criteria.\n\n1.  **Platelet Count:**\n    The patient's platelet count is given as $60,000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. The ISTH scoring for platelet count is as follows:\n    - Platelet count $> 100,000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$: $0$ points\n    - Platelet count $\\le 100,000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ but $> 50,000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$: $1$ point\n    - Platelet count $\\le 50,000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$: $2$ points\n    The patient's value of $60,000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ falls into the second category. Therefore, the score for the platelet count is $1$ point.\n\n2.  **Fibrin-Related Markers (Fibrin Degradation Products - FDP):**\n    The patient's FDP level is described as \"markedly elevated\". The ISTH scoring for fibrin-related markers is:\n    - No increase: $0$ points\n    - Moderate increase: $2$ points\n    - Strong (marked) increase: $3$ points\n    The description \"markedly elevated\" corresponds to a strong increase. Therefore, the score for FDP is $3$ points.\n\n3.  **Prolonged Prothrombin Time (PT):**\n    The patient's PT is prolonged by $5\\,\\mathrm{s}$ compared with the laboratory control. The ISTH scoring for PT prolongation is:\n    - Prolongation $ 3\\,\\mathrm{s}$: $0$ points\n    - Prolongation $\\ge 3\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and $ 6\\,\\mathrm{s}$: $1$ point\n    - Prolongation $\\ge 6\\,\\mathrm{s}$: $2$ points\n    The patient's PT prolongation of $5\\,\\mathrm{s}$ falls into the second category. Therefore, the score for PT is $1$ point.\n\n4.  **Fibrinogen Level:**\n    The patient's fibrinogen level is given as $90\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. The ISTH scoring for fibrinogen is:\n    - Fibrinogen level $> 100\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$: $0$ points\n    - Fibrinogen level $\\le 100\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$: $1$ point\n    The patient's value of $90\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ is less than or equal to $100\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. It is important to note that while fibrinogen levels are physiologically elevated in pregnancy, the standard ISTH cutoff is still used to score the severity of consumption, and a level below $100\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ is critically low. Therefore, the score for the fibrinogen level is $1$ point.\n\n**Total DIC Score Calculation:**\nThe total DIC score is the sum of the points from each of the four categories.\nTotal Score = (Platelet Score) + (FDP Score) + (PT Score) + (Fibrinogen Score)\n$$ \\text{Total Score} = 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 6 $$\n\n**Interpretation of the Score:**\nThe ISTH scoring system has an established threshold for diagnosis. A total score of $5$ or greater is considered consistent with (or compatible with) overt DIC. A score less than $5$ suggests non-overt DIC and warrants repeat testing.\nThe calculated score for this patient is $6$. Since $6 \\ge 5$, the score is consistent with overt disseminated intravascular coagulation, confirming the clinical suspicion of severe coagulopathy. The problem asks only for the integer score.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "4401175"}, {"introduction": "Stabilizing a patient with AFE-induced cardiovascular collapse requires swift and precise hemodynamic support.

This is a dimensional analysis problem that can be solved by systematically applying the foundational definitions of weight-based dosing and concentration.\n\nFirst, let us state the given quantities:\n- The ordered dose rate, $D_{\\text{ordered}} = 0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n- The patient's weight, $W = 80\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- The mass of norepinephrine in the solution, $M_{\\text{drug}} = 4\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n- The total volume of the solution, $V_{\\text{total}} = 250\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\nThe goal is to determine the infusion pump setting, which we shall denote as $R_{\\text{pump}}$, in units of $\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{hr}^{-1}$.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the total mass of drug the patient should receive per unit time. This patient-specific dose rate, $D_{\\text{patient}}$, is the product of the ordered weight-based dose rate and the patient's weight.\n$$D_{\\text{patient}} = D_{\\text{ordered}} \\times W$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$D_{\\text{patient}} = \\left(0.1\\,\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{min}}\\right) \\times (80\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 8\\,\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{min}}$$\nThis is the required rate of mass administration for the patient.\n\nThe second step is to determine the concentration, $C$, of the norepinephrine solution.

Our value for $D_{\\text{patient}}$ is in $\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, and our expression for $C$ is in $\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$. We must apply conversion factors to resolve these discrepancies.\nThe necessary conversion factors are:\n- $1\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$\n- $1\\,\\mathrm{hr} = 60\\,\\mathrm{min}$\n\nLet us construct the full expression for $R_{\\text{pump}}$ with all values and conversion factors.
