This practice bridges the gap between basic definitions—such as heart rate and cycle length—and their direct application in interpreting real-world Doppler data. By calculating the expected cycle length from a baseline heart rate and then analyzing a sequence of measured beat-to-beat intervals, you will learn to identify the subtle but critical signature of an arrhythmic event, such as a compensatory pause, which is a key step in accurate diagnosis. [@problem_id:4437475]", "problem": "A fetus at $32$ weeks of gestation is undergoing detailed fetal echocardiography due to intermittent rhythm irregularity. Pulsed Doppler across the left ventricular outflow tract shows a stable baseline fetal heart rate of $140$ beats per minute (bpm). In fetal rhythm analysis, the cycle length is defined as the beat-to-beat interval. Using only the definition of heart rate as $$HR=\\frac{\\text{beats}}{\\text{minute}}$$ and the definition of cycle length as $$CL=\\frac{\\text{time}}{\\text{beat}},$$ together with the unit conversions $1$ minute $=60$ seconds and $1$ second $=1000$ milliseconds, derive the cycle length in milliseconds for a heart rate of $140$ bpm.

Based on well-established fetal heart rate nomenclature, moderate physiologic variability is characterized by an amplitude of approximately $6$ to $25$ bpm around baseline in the absence of repetitive conduction block or compensatory pauses.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fetal cardiology, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its language and data. The problem will be solved in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of Cycle Length from Heart Rate\n\nThe problem provides the baseline fetal heart rate, $HR$, as $140$ beats per minute (bpm). The definitions for heart rate and cycle length, $CL$, are given as:\n$$HR = \\frac{\\text{beats}}{\\text{time}}$$\n$$CL = \\frac{\\text{time}}{\\text{beat}}$$\nFrom these definitions, it is evident that the cycle length is the reciprocal of the heart rate:\n$$CL = \\frac{1}{HR}$$\nThe heart rate is given in units of beats per minute. To find the cycle length in milliseconds (ms), we must perform a unit conversion. The necessary conversion factors are provided: $1$ minute $= 60$ seconds, and $1$ second $= 1000$ milliseconds.\n\nFirst, we express the heart rate in beats per millisecond.\n$$HR = 140 \\frac{\\text{beats}}{\\text{minute}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ minute}}{60 \\text{ seconds}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ second}}{1000 \\text{ milliseconds}}$$\n$$HR = \\frac{140}{60 \\times 1000} \\frac{\\text{beats}}{\\text{ms}} = \\frac{140}{60000} \\frac{\\text{beats}}{\\text{ms}}$$\nNow, we can calculate the cycle length by taking the reciprocal of the heart rate expressed in these units.\n$$CL = \\frac{1}{HR} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{140}{60000} \\frac{\\text{beats}}{\\text{ms}}} = \\frac{60000}{140} \\frac{\\text{ms}}{\\text{beat}}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$CL = \\frac{6000}{14} \\text{ ms} = \\frac{3000}{7} \\text{ ms}$$\nThe numerical value is approximately $428.5714...$ ms. The problem requires rounding this value to four significant figures.\n$$CL \\approx 428.6 \\text{ ms}$$\nThis is the expected cycle length for a stable heart rate of $140$ bpm.\n\nPart 2: Analysis of Beat-to-Beat Intervals\n\nThe problem provides a sequence of ten consecutive beat-to-beat intervals, which are measurements of the cycle length in milliseconds: $420$, $432$, $426$, $860$, $429$, $425$, $431$, $427$, $430$, and $428$. We are asked to compute the instantaneous heart rate for each interval and determine if the pattern suggests physiologic variability or an arrhythmia.\n\nThe relationship to convert cycle length in milliseconds to heart rate in beats per minute is the inverse of the one derived above:\n$$HR \\text{ (bpm)} = \\frac{60000 \\text{ ms/min}}{CL \\text{ (ms)}}$$\nUsing this formula, we calculate the instantaneous heart rate for each of the ten intervals:\n1. $CL_1 = 420 \\text{ ms} \\implies HR_1 = \\frac{60000}{420} \\approx 142.9 \\text{ bpm}$\n2. $CL_2 = 432 \\text{ ms} \\implies HR_2 = \\frac{60000}{432} \\approx 138.9 \\text{ bpm}$\n3. $CL_3 = 426 \\text{ ms} \\implies HR_3 = \\frac{60000}{426} \\approx 140.8 \\text{ bpm}$\n4. $CL_4 = 860 \\text{ ms} \\implies HR_4 = \\frac{60000}{860} \\approx 69.8 \\text{ bpm}$\n5. $CL_5 = 429 \\text{ ms} \\implies HR_5 = \\frac{60000}{429} \\approx 139.9 \\text{ bpm}$\n6. $CL_6 = 425 \\text{ ms} \\implies HR_6 = \\frac{60000}{425} \\approx 141.2 \\text{ bpm}$\n7. $CL_7 = 431 \\text{ ms} \\implies HR_7 = \\frac{60000}{431} \\approx 139.2 \\text{ bpm}$\n8. $CL_8 = 427 \\text{ ms} \\implies HR_8 = \\frac{60000}{427} \\approx 140.5 \\text{ bpm}$\n9. $CL_9 = 430 \\text{ ms} \\implies HR_9 = \\frac{60000}{430} \\approx 139.5 \\text{ bpm}$\n10. $CL_{10} = 428 \\text{ ms} \\implies HR_{10} = \\frac{60000}{428} \\approx 140.2 \\text{ bpm}$\n\nThe problem defines moderate physiologic variability as an amplitude of approximately $6$ to $25$ bpm around the baseline of $140$ bpm. This corresponds to a heart rate range from ($140 - 25$) bpm to ($140 + 25$) bpm, or $115$ bpm to $165$ bpm.\n\nAnalyzing the calculated instantaneous heart rates, we observe that nine of the ten beats ($HR_1, HR_2, HR_3, HR_5, ..., HR_{10}$) fall within a narrow band around the baseline. The minimum rate among these nine is approximately $138.9$ bpm, and the maximum is approximately $142.9$ bpm. The total variation is $142.9 - 138.9 = 4.0$ bpm, which is well within the $6$ to $25$ bpm range specified for moderate physiologic variability.\n\nHowever, the fourth interval, $CL_4 = 860$ ms, yields an instantaneous heart rate of approximately $69.8$ bpm. This rate is substantially below the lower limit for physiologic variability ($115$ bpm). The sudden drop in heart rate to this level is not characteristic of physiologic variability.\n\nFurthermore, the problem states that physiologic variability occurs in the absence of compensatory pauses. The cycle length of the non-bradycardic beats averages approximately $428$ ms. The anomalous interval, $CL_4 = 860$ ms, is almost exactly double this value ($2 \\times 430 = 860$). This long interval following a series of normal beats is the defining characteristic of a compensatory pause, which typically occurs after a premature, non-conducted atrial contraction (a form of arrhythmia). The electrical impulse from the premature beat is blocked and does not result in a ventricular contraction, leading to a \"skipped beat\" and an interval that is approximately twice the normal beat-to-beat interval.\n\nTherefore, the observed pattern is not consistent with physiologic variability alone. The presence of a sudden, profound bradycardic event corresponding to a compensatory pause strongly suggests an underlying arrhythmic event.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{428.6}$$", "id": "4437475"}, {"introduction": "Surveillance for atrioventricular (AV) block is critical in certain high-risk pregnancies, and Motion-mode (M-mode) echocardiography is a primary tool for this purpose.
