In epidemiologic terms, the risk of an outcome is the probability of that outcome in a defined population over a specified interval, and the relative risk is the ratio of the risk in an exposed group to the risk in an unexposed group. Among pregnant individuals with placenta previa, widely cited clinical estimates report the probability of PAS to be $11\\%$ when there is one prior cesarean delivery and $3\\%$ when there is no prior cesarean delivery. Treat these estimates as the risks in the exposed group (placenta previa with one prior cesarean) and the unexposed group (placenta previa with no prior cesarean), respectively. Using foundational epidemiologic definitions only, compute the relative risk of PAS associated with having one prior cesarean compared with having no prior cesarean among patients with placenta previa.

The solution will be derived directly from the foundational epidemiologic definitions provided in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the given information. The problem defines the following quantities:\n- The exposed group consists of pregnant individuals with placenta previa and one prior cesarean delivery.\n- The unexposed group consists of pregnant individuals with placenta previa and no prior cesarean delivery.\n- The outcome of interest is the diagnosis of PAS.\n\nThe risk of an outcome is stated to be the probability of that outcome occurring in a defined population. Let $R_{exposed}$ denote the risk of PAS in the exposed group, and $R_{unexposed}$ denote the risk of PAS in the unexposed group.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the probability of PAS in the exposed group is given as $11\\%$. Therefore, we can write the risk for the exposed group as a dimensionless probability:\n$$R_{exposed} = 11\\% = \\frac{11}{100} = 0.11$$\n\nSimilarly, the probability of PAS in the unexposed group is given as $3\\%$. The risk for the unexposed group is:\n$$R_{unexposed} = 3\\% = \\frac{3}{100} = 0.03$$\n\nThe problem defines the relative risk, denoted as $RR$, as the ratio of the risk in an exposed group to the risk in an unexposed group. The formula is:\n$$RR = \\frac{R_{exposed}}{R_{unexposed}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given risk values into this formula, we get:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.11}{0.03}$$\n\nThis is equivalent to the fraction:\n$$RR = \\frac{11}{3}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of this fraction:\n$$RR = 3.666...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a dimensionless number rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $3.666...$ has a first significant figure of $3$, a second of $6$, and a third of $6$. The fourth digit is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we must round up the third significant figure.\n\nRounding $3.666...$ to three significant figures gives:\n$$RR \\approx 3.67$$\n\nThis value is dimensionless, as it is a ratio of two probabilities, which are themselves dimensionless quantities.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.67}$$", "id": "4489564"}, {"introduction": "Once a patient is identified as being at risk for PAS, the next step is diagnostic evaluation.

The value $\\mathrm{NPV} \\approx 0.9942$ signifies that for a patient in this moderate-risk cohort who receives a negative result from the specialized test, there is a $0.9942$ probability that she is truly free of placenta accreta spectrum.

This quantitative evidence strongly supports a clinical decision to de-escalate care, i.e., to discharge the patient from a specialized, high-resource placenta accreta spectrum pathway to standard obstetric care.

The conversion from milliliters to liters is performed by dividing by $1000$.\n$$V_{\\mathrm{blood}} = 5250\\ \\mathrm{mL} \\times \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{L}}{1000\\ \\mathrm{mL}} = 5.25\\ \\mathrm{L}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that this value must be rounded to four significant figures. To express $5.25$ with four significant figures, a trailing zero is added.\n$$V_{\\mathrm{blood}} = 5.250\\ \\mathrm{L}$$\n\nThe second step is to calculate the number of PRBC units required. The planning threshold requires preparing for a replacement of $150\\%$ of the estimated blood volume. First, we calculate this total replacement volume, $V_{\\mathrm{replace}}$.\n\n$$V_{\\mathrm{replace}} = 150\\% \\times V_{\\mathrm{blood}} = 1.5 \\times V_{\\mathrm{blood}}$$\nUsing the blood volume in milliliters for consistency with the PRBC unit volume:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{replace}} = 1.5 \\times 5250\\ \\mathrm{mL} = 7875\\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nNext, we determine the number of PRBC units, $N_{\\mathrm{PRBC}}$, by dividing the total replacement volume by the volume of a single PRBC unit, $V_{\\mathrm{PRBC}}$.\n\n$$N_{\\mathrm{PRBC}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{replace}}}{V_{\\mathrm{PRBC}}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{PRBC}} = \\frac{7875\\ \\mathrm{mL}}{300\\ \\mathrm{mL}} = 26.25$$\n\nThe problem requires the number of units to be the smallest integer not less than the computed value.
