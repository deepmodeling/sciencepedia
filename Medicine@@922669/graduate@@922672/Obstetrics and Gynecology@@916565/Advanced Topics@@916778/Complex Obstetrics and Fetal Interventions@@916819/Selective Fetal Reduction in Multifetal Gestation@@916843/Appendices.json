Let chorionicity be coded by the event $C \\in \\{\\text{monochorionic}, \\text{dichorionic}\\}$. The physiology suggests two mechanistically distinct routes to co-twin injury: a procedure-related route that does not depend on shared placental vasculature, and a vascular route that requires intertwin placental anastomoses.

For purposes of planning, the investigators adopt the following widely used epidemiologic definitions and assumptions: per-fetus perinatal mortality risk is the probability that an individual fetus in a multifetal pregnancy results in a stillbirth or early neonatal death; the risk ratio (RR) is defined as the ratio of per-fetus risk in one exposure group to that in a reference group; and, conditional on multiplicity, each fetus’s perinatal outcome is independent and identically distributed. SFR is performed between $12$ and $14$ weeks’ gestation. The procedure itself carries a probability $q$ of complete pregnancy loss (loss of the entire ongoing pregnancy after reduction), in which case both remaining fetuses die; otherwise, the reduced pregnancy continues as a twin gestation with the baseline per-fetus risk for twins. The intentional termination of the third fetus during SFR is not counted as a perinatal death.\n\nThe following empiric inputs are available from recent population-based data in the region:\n- Baseline per-fetus perinatal mortality risk in twin gestations is $r_{2} = 0.016$.\n- The observed risk ratio of per-fetus perinatal mortality comparing triplet to twin gestations is $\\mathrm{RR} = 3.0$.\n- The probability of complete pregnancy loss attributable to SFR is $q = 0.015$.\n- There are $N = 400$ incident triplet pregnancies expected in the next year, all of which are candidates for SFR.\n\nUsing only the core definitions above and standard probability expectations, first determine the implied baseline per-fetus perinatal mortality risk in triplet gestations, and then compute the expected number of perinatal deaths averted in this $N$-pregnancy cohort if all triplet pregnancies undergo SFR to twins at $12$–$14$ weeks.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent.

The expected number of perinatal deaths, $E_{no\\_SFR}$, is the total number of fetuses multiplied by the per-fetus mortality risk $r_3$.\n$$ E_{no\\_SFR} = (3 \\times N) \\times r_3 $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ E_{no\\_SFR} = (3 \\times 400) \\times 0.048 = 1200 \\times 0.048 = 57.6 $$\n\n**3. Expected Perinatal Deaths with Universal SFR**\nFor the same cohort of $N=400$ triplet pregnancies, if all undergo SFR to twins, we must account for the two possible outcomes of the procedure for each pregnancy.\n\n- **Outcome A: Complete Pregnancy Loss.** This occurs with probability $q=0.015$. In this scenario, the procedure results in the loss of the entire pregnancy, meaning the $2$ remaining fetuses die. The number of perinatal deaths for this outcome is $2$.\n- **Outcome B: Successful Reduction.** This occurs with probability $1-q$. The pregnancy continues as a twin gestation. There are $2$ fetuses, and each has a per-fetus perinatal mortality risk of $r_2=0.016$. The expected number of perinatal deaths in this successfully reduced pregnancy is $2 \\times r_2$.\n\nThe total expected number of perinatal deaths for a single triplet pregnancy undergoing SFR, $E_{preg\\_SFR}$, is the sum of the expected deaths from each outcome, weighted by their probabilities:\n$$ E_{preg\\_SFR} = (2 \\times q) + (2 \\times r_2 \\times (1-q)) $$\nWe can factor out the term $2$:\n$$ E_{preg\\_SFR} = 2 [q + r_2(1-q)] $$\nFor the entire cohort of $N=400$ pregnancies, the total expected number of perinatal deaths, $E_{with\\_SFR}$, is:\n$$ E_{with\\_SFR} = N \\times E_{preg\\_SFR} = N \\times 2 [q + r_2(1-q)] $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$ E_{with\\_SFR} = 400 \\times 2 [0.015 + 0.016(1 - 0.015)] $$\n$$ E_{with\\_SFR} = 800 [0.015 + 0.016(0.985)] $$\n$$ E_{with\\_SFR} = 800 [0.015 + 0.01576] $$\n$$ E_{with\\_SFR} = 800 [0.03076] $$\n$$ E_{with\\_SFR} = 24.608 $$\n\n**4.
