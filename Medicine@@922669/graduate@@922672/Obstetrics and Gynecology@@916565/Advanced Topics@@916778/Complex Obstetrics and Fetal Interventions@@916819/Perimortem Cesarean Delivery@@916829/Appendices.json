A solution will be formulated.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of the post-intervention probability of maternal ROSC, denoted as $p_{1}$. We are given the baseline probability, $p_{0}$, and the relative increase in this probability due to the intervention.\n\nThe baseline probability of ROSC without PMCD is given as:\n$$p_{0} = 0.10$$\n\nThe intervention (PMCD) is stated to produce a \"relative increase of $0.30$\". The definition of a relative increase, which we can denote as $R$, in a probability from a baseline $p_{0}$ to a new value $p_{1}$ is given by the ratio of the absolute increase ($p_{1} - p_{0}$) to the baseline probability ($p_{0}$):\n$$R = \\frac{p_{1} - p_{0}}{p_{0}}$$\n\nWe are given $R = 0.30$. We can rearrange this equation to solve for the post-intervention probability, $p_{1}$.\n$$R \\cdot p_{0} = p_{1} - p_{0}$$\n$$p_{1} = p_{0} + R \\cdot p_{0}$$\nFactoring out $p_{0}$, we obtain:\n$$p_{1} = p_{0} (1 + R)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this equation:\n$$p_{0} = 0.10$$\n$$R = 0.30$$\n\n$$p_{1} = 0.10 \\times (1 + 0.30)$$\n$$p_{1} = 0.10 \\times 1.30$$\n$$p_{1} = 0.13$$\n\nThe problem requires this result to be reported as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n$$p_{1} = 0.1300$$\n\nNext, we must compare this post-intervention probability $p_{1}$ to the institutional action threshold, $p_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\nThe action threshold is given as:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{th}} = 0.12$$\n\nWe evaluate the inequality $p_{1} \\geq p_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n$$0.1300 \\geq 0.12$$\nThis inequality is true.\n\n### Interpretation of Clinical Significance\nThe calculated post-intervention maternal ROSC probability, $p_{1} = 0.13$, exceeds the institution's predefined action threshold of $p_{\\mathrm{th}} = 0.12$. This result signifies that, according to the institution's decision-making model, the expected benefit of performing PMCD is sufficient to justify the procedure. The analysis provides a quantitative rationale supporting the clinical decision to escalate care and proceed with PMCD by the $4$-minute mark in this specific scenario of maternal cardiac arrest.

The problem provides several clinical time points, but the calculations hinge on two primary guidelines:\n1.  The initiation of the Perimortem Cesarean Delivery (PMCD), defined as the skin incision, must occur by $t=4$ minutes.\n2.  The uterine evacuation and neonatal delivery must be completed by $t=5$ minutes.\n\nLet $t_{\\text{incision}}$ be the time at which the skin incision begins, and let $t_{\\text{delivery}}$ be the time at which the neonate is delivered.
