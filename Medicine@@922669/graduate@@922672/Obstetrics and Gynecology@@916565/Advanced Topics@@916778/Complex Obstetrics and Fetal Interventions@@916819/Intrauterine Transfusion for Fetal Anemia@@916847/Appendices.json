Assume a single well-mixed simple transfusion into the umbilical vein without removal of fetal blood. Use the widely accepted approximation that fetoplacental blood volume is $100$ milliliters per kilogram of fetal weight.

It is based on established principles of fluid mixing and conservation laws applied to a standard clinical scenario. The data provided are self-consistent and sufficient to derive a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the principle of conservation of red cell volume during a simple mixing process. Let us define the relevant variables first.\nLet $V_{feto}$ be the initial fetoplacental blood volume, and $V_{donor}$ be the volume of the donor packed red blood cells (PRBC) to be transfused.\nLet $Hct_{pre}$ be the initial fetal hematocrit, $Hct_{post}$ be the desired final hematocrit, and $Hct_{donor}$ be the hematocrit of the donor PRBC unit.\n\nHematocrit ($Hct$) is defined as the ratio of the volume of red cells ($V_{RC}$) to the total blood volume ($V_{blood}$): $Hct = \\frac{V_{RC}}{V_{blood}}$.\n\nFrom this definition, the initial volume of red cells in the fetus is:\n$$V_{RC, pre} = V_{feto} \\times Hct_{pre}$$\nThe volume of red cells in the donor unit to be transfused is:\n$$V_{RC, donor} = V_{donor} \\times Hct_{donor}$$\nIn a simple transfusion, the final volume of red cells is the sum of the initial fetal red cells and the transfused donor red cells. Applying the conservation of red cell volume:\n$$V_{RC, post} = V_{RC, pre} + V_{RC, donor} = (V_{feto} \\times Hct_{pre}) + (V_{donor} \\times Hct_{donor})$$\nThe final total blood volume after the transfusion is the sum of the initial fetal volume and the added donor volume:\n$$V_{total, post} = V_{feto} + V_{donor}$$\nThe post-transfusion hematocrit is the ratio of the final red cell volume to the final total blood volume:\n$$Hct_{post} = \\frac{V_{RC, post}}{V_{total, post}} = \\frac{(V_{feto} \\times Hct_{pre}) + (V_{donor} \\times Hct_{donor})}{V_{feto} + V_{donor}}$$\nTo derive the formula for the required transfusion volume, $V_{donor}$, we must solve this equation for $V_{donor}$:\n$$Hct_{post} (V_{feto} + V_{donor}) = (V_{feto} \\times Hct_{pre}) + (V_{donor} \\times Hct_{donor})$$\n$$Hct_{post} V_{feto} + Hct_{post} V_{donor} = Hct_{pre} V_{feto} + Hct_{donor} V_{donor}$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate $V_{donor}$:\n$$V_{donor} Hct_{donor} - V_{donor} Hct_{post} = V_{feto} Hct_{post} - V_{feto} Hct_{pre}$$\n$$V_{donor} (Hct_{donor} - Hct_{post}) = V_{feto} (Hct_{post} - Hct_{pre})$$\nThis yields the general formula for the transfusion volume:\n$$V_{donor} = V_{feto} \\frac{Hct_{post} - Hct_{pre}}{Hct_{donor} - Hct_{post}}$$\nNext, we analyze the propagation of the error in fetal weight. Let $W_{est}$ be the estimated weight and $W_{true}$ be the true weight. The problem states a $10\\%$ overestimation, so $W_{est} = (1 + 0.10) W_{true} = 1.1 W_{true}$. The fetoplacental blood volume, $V_{feto}$, is given as $100 \\, \\text{mL/kg}$ of fetal weight, which implies $V_{feto}$ is directly proportional to weight. Thus, the estimated blood volume, $V_{feto, est}$, is also overestimated by $10\\%$: $V_{feto, est} = 1.1 V_{feto, true}$.\nFrom the derived transfusion formula, $V_{donor}$ is directly proportional to $V_{feto}$, as the term $\\frac{Hct_{post} - Hct_{pre}}{Hct_{donor} - Hct_{post}}$ is a constant for this procedure. Therefore, a $10\\%$ overestimation in $V_{feto}$ propagates directly to a $10\\%$ overestimation in the calculated transfusion volume, $V_{donor}$.\n\nNow we can compute the transfusion volume using the given values.\nThe estimated fetal weight is $W_{est} = 1.60 \\, \\text{kg}$.\nThe fetoplacental blood volume is estimated as $V_{feto, est} = 1.60 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 100 \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg}} = 160 \\, \\text{mL}$.\nThe given hematocrit values are: $Hct_{pre} = 0.12$, $Hct_{post} = 0.40$, and $Hct_{donor} = 0.85$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula gives the calculated transfusion volume based on the ultrasound estimate, denoted $V_{donor, est}$:\n$$V_{donor, est} = 160 \\frac{0.40 - 0.12}{0.85 - 0.40} = 160 \\frac{0.28}{0.45} = 160 \\frac{28}{45} \\, \\text{mL}$$\n$$V_{donor, est} = \\frac{4480}{45} \\approx 99.555... \\, \\text{mL}$$\nThe problem instructs to apply a safety margin by down-adjusting this calculated volume by $10\\%$ to mitigate the risk of volume overload, which could result from the suspected weight overestimation.\nThe final recommended volume, $V_{final}$, is therefore:\n$$V_{final} = V_{donor, est} \\times (1 - 0.10) = 0.90 \\times V_{donor, est}$$\n$$V_{final} = 0.90 \\times \\left(160 \\frac{28}{45}\\right) = \\frac{9}{10} \\times \\frac{160 \\times 28}{45} = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{160 \\times 28}{5} = \\frac{32 \\times 28}{10}$$\n$$V_{final} = \\frac{896}{10} = 89.6 \\, \\text{mL}$$\nThe result is required to be rounded to three significant figures.

Kell antibodies target the Kell antigen expressed on fetal erythroid precursors in the bone marrow, suppressing erythropoiesis and leading to severe reticulocytopenia.

Therefore, targeting a higher post-transfusion hemoglobin provides an oxygen-carrying capacity “buffer,” prolonging the inter-transfusion interval and reducing procedure frequency and risk.\n\nTo compute the additional transfusion volume rigorously, we use mass conservation and the definition of hematocrit.

This can be modeled using a first-order ordinary differential equation, as stipulated by the problem's reference to `the definition of the derivative as the rate of change`.\n\nLet $H(t)$ be the fetal hemoglobin concentration in g/dL at time $t$ in days. The initial condition, measured immediately post-transfusion at $t=0$, is given as:\n$$H(0) = 13$$\n\nThe problem states that the net decline in fetal hemoglobin is constant at a rate of $0.3$ g/dL per day. A decline signifies a negative rate of change. Therefore, the differential equation governing the evolution of $H(t)$ is:\n$$\\frac{dH}{dt} = -0.3$$\n\nTo find the function $H(t)$, we integrate the differential equation with respect to time $t$:\n$$\\int dH = \\int (-0.3) dt$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$H(t) = -0.3t + C$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\nWe determine the value of $C$ by applying the initial condition, $H(0) = 13$. Substituting $t=0$ into the equation:\n$$H(0) = -0.3(0) + C$$\n$$13 = C$$\n\nThus, the specific equation describing the hemoglobin concentration as a function of time is:\n$$H(t) = 13 - 0.3t$$\n\nThe next step is to find the time $t$ at which a repeat transfusion is triggered. This occurs when the hemoglobin concentration $H(t)$ reaches the value of $9$ g/dL. We set $H(t) = 9$ and solve for $t$:\n$$9 = 13 - 0.3t$$\n\nWe rearrange the equation to isolate the term with $t$:\n$$0.3t = 13 - 9$$\n$$0.3t = 4$$\n\nSolving for $t$:\n$$t = \\frac{4}{0.3}$$\n$$t = \\frac{4}{\\frac{3}{10}} = 4 \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{40}{3}$$\n\nThe exact value for the time interval is $t = \\frac{40}{3}$ days.
