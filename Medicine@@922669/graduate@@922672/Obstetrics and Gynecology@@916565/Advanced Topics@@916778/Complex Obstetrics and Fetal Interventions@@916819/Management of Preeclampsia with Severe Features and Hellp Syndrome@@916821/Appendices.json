The problem defines this ratio as:\n$$ \\text{PCR} = \\frac{\\text{Mass concentration of urine protein}}{\\text{Mass concentration of urine creatinine}} $$\nThe final units are specified as $\\mathrm{mg/mg}$, which implies a dimensionless ratio of masses. To compute this, both concentrations must be expressed in units of mass per unit volume (e.g., $\\mathrm{mg/L}$ or $\\mathrm{g/L}$).\n\nThe given urine protein concentration is already a mass concentration:\n$$ C_p = 6.40 \\times 10^{2} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}} = 640 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}} $$\n\nThe given urine creatinine concentration is a molar concentration:\n$$ C_{c, \\text{molar}} = 9.00 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}}{\\mathrm{L}} $$\nTo use this in the PCR formula, it must be converted to a mass concentration. The relationship between mass concentration ($C_{\\text{mass}}$), molar concentration ($C_{\\text{molar}}$), and molar mass ($M$) is:\n$$ C_{\\text{mass}} = C_{\\text{molar}} \\times M $$\n\nFirst, we convert the molar concentration of creatinine from millimoles per liter ($\\mathrm{mmol/L}$) to moles per liter ($\\mathrm{mol/L}$):\n$$ C_{c, \\text{molar}} = 9.00 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\mathrm{mol}}{1000 \\, \\mathrm{mmol}} = 9.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}} $$\n\nThe molar mass of creatinine is given as:\n$$ M_c = 113.12 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{mol}} $$\n\nNow, we calculate the mass concentration of creatinine in grams per liter ($\\mathrm{g/L}$):\n$$ C_{c, \\text{mass}} = \\left(9.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}}\\right) \\times \\left(113.12 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{mol}}\\right) = 1.01808 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{L}} $$\n\nThe protein concentration is given in milligrams per liter ($\\mathrm{mg/L}$). To maintain consistent units for the ratio, we convert the creatinine mass concentration to $\\mathrm{mg/L}$:\n$$ C_{c, \\text{mass}} = 1.01808 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{1000 \\, \\mathrm{mg}}{1 \\, \\mathrm{g}} = 1018.08 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}} $$\n\nWith both concentrations in the same units of $\\mathrm{mg/L}$, we can calculate the dimensionless PCR. The volume units ($\\mathrm{L}$) will cancel out.\n$$ \\text{PCR} = \\frac{C_p}{C_{c, \\text{mass}}} = \\frac{640 \\, \\mathrm{mg/L}}{1018.08 \\, \\mathrm{mg/L}} \\approx 0.628643 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\text{PCR} \\approx 0.629 $$\nThe units are implicitly $\\mathrm{mg/mg}$, as requested.\n\nThe secondary part of the task is to determine if the criterion for proteinuria is met. The diagnostic threshold is given as $\\text{PCR} \\ge 0.3 \\, \\mathrm{mg/mg}$.\nOur calculated value is $\\text{PCR} \\approx 0.629 \\, \\mathrm{mg/mg}$.\nSince $0.629  0.3$, the protein criterion for the diagnosis of preeclampsia is met.\n\nThe final answer to be reported is only the numeric value of the PCR.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.629} $$", "id": "4466565"}, {"introduction": "Managing severe hypertension in preeclampsia is a delicate balancing act.
