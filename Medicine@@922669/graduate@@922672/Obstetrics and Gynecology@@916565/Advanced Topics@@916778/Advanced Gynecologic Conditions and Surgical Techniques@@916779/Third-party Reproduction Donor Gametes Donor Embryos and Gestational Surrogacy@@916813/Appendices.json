After thaw, the andrology laboratory measures the following for a single donor sperm vial destined for clinical use: volume $V = 0.4$ milliliters, concentration $C = 40 \\times 10^6$ sperm per milliliter, and progressive motility fraction $p = 0.30$ at $30$ minutes post-thaw. The laboratory uses a density-gradient preparation that retains a constant fraction $r = 0.85$ of motile sperm from the thawed specimen into the final insemination preparation.\n\nFundamental definitions to be used:\n- Progressive motility refers to the fraction of sperm exhibiting forward progression in the post-thaw evaluation.\n- Concentration is the number of sperm per unit volume.\n- Total motile sperm count is the number of progressively motile sperm available in the insemination preparation after processing.\n\nThe clinic follows the following widely used, evidence-informed internal thresholds for technique selection based on post-preparation total motile sperm count:\n- For intrauterine insemination (IUI), a minimum post-wash total motile sperm count of $5.0 \\times 10^6$ is required to proceed with IUI.\n- For conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF), the insemination protocol is set to target approximately $1.0 \\times 10^5$ motile sperm per mature oocyte.

It is scientifically grounded in the field of clinical andrology and reproductive medicine, well-posed with all necessary data and clear definitions, and objective in its presentation. The parameters provided are realistic for a post-thaw donor sperm sample. The clinical decision thresholds are standard and create a non-overlapping, exhaustive set of conditions. Therefore, a unique solution can be derived.\n\nThe primary objective is to calculate the post-wash total motile sperm count, hereafter denoted as $N_{final}$, and then to select the appropriate clinical procedure based on the given thresholds.\n\nThe givens are:\n-   Initial volume of the sample: $V = 0.4$\n-   Initial sperm concentration: $C = 40 \\times 10^6$ per milliliter\n-   Progressive motility fraction of the thawed sperm: $p = 0.30$\n-   Retention fraction of motile sperm after preparation: $r = 0.85$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of sperm in the thawed vial, $N_{total}$. This is the product of the volume and the concentration.\n$$N_{total} = V \\times C$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$N_{total} = (0.4) \\times (40 \\times 10^6) = 16 \\times 10^6$$\nSo, the vial contains a total of $16 \\times 10^6$ sperm.\n\nNext, we determine the number of progressively motile sperm in this initial sample, $N_{motile\\_pre}$, before the density-gradient preparation. This is found by multiplying the total sperm count by the progressive motility fraction, $p$.\n$$N_{motile\\_pre} = N_{total} \\times p$$\n$$N_{motile\\_pre} = (16 \\times 10^6) \\times (0.30) = 4.8 \\times 10^6$$\nThus, there are $4.8 \\times 10^6$ progressively motile sperm in the thawed vial prior to processing.\n\nThe problem states that the density-gradient preparation retains a fraction $r = 0.85$ of the motile sperm. The final post-wash total motile sperm count, $N_{final}$, available for insemination is therefore:\n$$N_{final} = N_{motile\\_pre} \\times r$$\n$$N_{final} = (4.8 \\times 10^6) \\times (0.85)$$\nTo compute the product:\n$$4.8 \\times 0.85 = 4.08$$\nSo, the final total motile sperm count is:\n$$N_{final} = 4.08 \\times 10^6$$\n\nNow, we must compare this result to the clinic's internal thresholds to select the appropriate technique. The thresholds are as follows:\n-   Intrauterine insemination (IUI, Code $1$): requires $N_{final} \\ge 5.0 \\times 10^6$.\n-   Conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF, Code $2$): requires at least $1.0 \\times 10^6$ motile sperm. This applies when the count is insufficient for IUI but sufficient for IVF. Thus, the range is $1.0 \\times 10^6 \\le N_{final} < 5.0 \\times 10^6$.\n-   IVF with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI, Code $3$): employed if $N_{final} < 1.0 \\times 10^6$.\n\nOur calculated value is $N_{final} = 4.08 \\times 10^6$. We test this against the conditions:\n1.  Is $4.08 \\times 10^6 \\ge 5.0 \\times 10^6$? This is false. Therefore, IUI is not the selected technique.\n2.  Is $4.08 \\times 10^6 < 1.0 \\times 10^6$? This is false. Therefore, ICSI is not the selected technique.\n3.  Is $1.0 \\times 10^6 \\le 4.08 \\times 10^6 < 5.0 \\times 10^6$? This is true. The lower bound is satisfied ($4.08 \\times 10^6 \\ge 1.0 \\times 10^6$) and the upper bound is satisfied ($4.08 \\times 10^6 < 5.0 \\times 10^6$).\n\nThe condition for conventional IVF is met.

You will use Bayesian principles and Mendelian genetics to determine the donor's residual risk of being a carrier and, consequently, the final risk to the offspring, a fundamental skill for providing accurate genetic counseling [@problem_id:4516902].", "problem": "In a third-party reproduction scenario involving donor gametes, an intended parent undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF; In Vitro Fertilization) with a gestational surrogate is a known heterozygous carrier for a pathogenic variant in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) gene. The sperm donor has undergone carrier screening targeted to the same variant and received a negative test result. Assume the following:\n- The donor population carrier prevalence for this specific CFTR variant is $q$ (that is, the prior probability that a randomly selected donor is a heterozygous carrier is $q$).\n- The screening test has sensitivity $s$ for detecting heterozygous carriers of this variant and has specificity equal to $1$.\n- Donors with positive screening results are excluded from donation, and only donors with negative results proceed.\n- The intended parent’s carrier status is already known (probability $1$ of being a heterozygote for this variant), and homozygous affected donors are clinically excluded prior to screening.\n\nUsing fundamental principles of Mendelian inheritance for autosomal recessive disease, the definition of test sensitivity and specificity, and conditional probability (Bayes’ theorem), derive the offspring’s probability of being affected with cystic fibrosis as a function of $q$ and $s$.

Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning an individual must inherit two copies of the pathogenic allele (one from each parent) to be affected. The intended parent is a known heterozygous carrier. The sperm donor has tested negative on a screening test with known performance characteristics.\n\nLet us define the following events and probabilities:\n- $IP_C$: The event that the intended parent is a heterozygous carrier. From the problem statement, this is a known fact, so its probability is $P(IP_C) = 1$.\n- $D_C$: The event that a randomly selected donor is a heterozygous carrier. The prior probability is given as the population carrier prevalence, $P(D_C) = q$.\n- $D_{NC}$: The event that a randomly selected donor is not a carrier (is homozygous for the normal allele). Since homozygous affected donors are excluded, the donor population consists only of carriers and non-carriers. Thus, the prior probability is $P(D_{NC}) = 1 - P(D_C) = 1-q$.\n- $T_+$: The event that a screening test result is positive.\n- $T_-$: The event that a screening test result is negative. The donor used in this scenario had a negative test result.\n- $O_A$: The event that the offspring is affected with cystic fibrosis (genotype is homozygous for the pathogenic allele).\n\nThe problem provides the following test characteristics:\n- Sensitivity $s = P(T_+ | D_C)$. This is the probability of a positive test given the individual is a carrier.\n- Specificity is $1$, so $P(T_- | D_{NC}) = 1$. This is the probability of a negative test given the individual is not a carrier.\n\nThe probability of a false negative, i.e., a negative test result for a carrier, is $P(T_- | D_C) = 1 - P(T_+ | D_C) = 1 - s$.\nThe probability of a false positive, i.e., a positive test result for a non-carrier, is $P(T_+ | D_{NC}) = 1 - P(T_- | D_{NC}) = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n\nAn offspring can only be affected ($O_A$) if both parents are carriers and both pass on the pathogenic allele.\nThe intended parent is known to be a carrier. Therefore, the probability of an affected offspring depends on the probability that the donor is a carrier, despite having a negative test result. This is a conditional probability, which we denote as $P(D_C | T_-)$.\n\nThe probability of an affected offspring can be expressed as:\n$$P(O_A) = P(O_A | IP_C \\cap D_C) \\times P(D_C | T_-) \\times P(IP_C) + P(O_A | IP_C \\cap D_{NC}) \\times P(D_{NC} | T_-) \\times P(IP_C)$$\nGiven that the intended parent is a carrier ($P(IP_C)=1$), this simplifies. The probability of an affected offspring if one parent is not a carrier ($D_{NC}$) is $0$, so $P(O_A | IP_C \\cap D_{NC}) = 0$. The expression becomes:\n$$P(O_A) = P(O_A | IP_C \\cap D_C) \\times P(D_C | T_-)$$\nFrom Mendelian genetics, if two heterozygous parents have a child, the probability of that child being homozygous recessive (affected) is $\\frac{1}{4}$.
