The presence of the parameter $\\alpha$ is a test of the student's ability to discern relevant from irrelevant information, as the problem explicitly states to treat both forms of UPD as equivalent for viability, rendering $\\alpha$ extraneous. This does not make the problem ill-posed.\n-   **Objective**: The language is technical and precise, free from subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in quantitative genetics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the proportion of surviving zygotes at the blastocyst stage that are trisomic for chromosome $15$. This can be expressed as a conditional probability: the probability that a zygote is trisomic, given that it has survived to the blastocyst stage. We can formulate this as the ratio of the total probability of a zygote being trisomic and surviving, to the total probability of a zygote surviving, regardless of karyotype.\n\nLet's analyze the pathways from fertilization to the blastocyst stage. We consider two initial populations of zygotes, based on the oocyte's chromosomal content.\n\n**Pathway 1: Fertilization with a normal oocyte.**\nThis occurs with a probability of $1-p$.\n- A normal oocyte (one maternal chromosome $15$) is fertilized by a normal sperm (one paternal chromosome $15$).\n- The resulting zygote is diploid, or euploid, for chromosome $15$.\n- The proportion of initial zygotes that are euploid from this pathway is $1-p$.\n- These euploid zygotes survive to the blastocyst stage with probability $v_{E}$.\n- The proportion of the initial population of zygotes that become surviving euploid blastocysts from this pathway is $(1-p)v_{E}$.\n\n**Pathway 2: Fertilization with a disomic oocyte.**\nThis occurs with a probability of $p$.\n- A disomic oocyte (two maternal chromosomes $15$) is fertilized by a normal sperm (one paternal chromosome $15$).\n- The resulting zygote is trisomic for chromosome $15$.\n- The proportion of initial zygotes that are trisomic is $p$.\nThese trisomic zygotes can follow two subsequent paths:\n\n**Sub-pathway 2a: No trisomy rescue.**\n- This occurs with probability $1-r$.\n- The zygote remains trisomic.\n- The proportion of initial zygotes that follow this path is $p(1-r)$.\n- These trisomic zygotes survive with probability $v_{T}$.\n- The proportion of the initial zygote population that become surviving trisomic blastocysts is $p(1-r)v_{T}$.\n\n**Sub-pathway 2b: Trisomy rescue occurs.**\n- This occurs with probability $r$.\n- The rescue process involves the random loss of one of the three homologous chromosomes.\n- Probability of losing the paternal homolog: $1/3$. The zygote becomes a maternal Uniparental Disomy (UPD) case (two maternal chromosomes). The proportion of initial zygotes following this path to UPD is $p \\times r \\times \\frac{1}{3}$. These UPD zygotes survive with probability $v_{U}$. The proportion of surviving UPD blastocysts from this path is $\\frac{1}{3}prv_{U}$.\n- Probability of losing one of the two maternal homologs: $2/3$. The zygote becomes euploid (one maternal, one paternal chromosome). The proportion of initial zygotes following this path to rescued euploidy is $p \\times r \\times \\frac{2}{3}$. These rescued euploid zygotes survive with probability $v_{E}$. The proportion of surviving euploid blastocysts from this path is $\\frac{2}{3}prv_{E}$.\n(Note: The parameter $\\alpha$ concerning the meiotic origin of nondisjunction determines whether the UPD is heterodisomic or isodisomic. Since the viability $v_U$ is the same for both, $\\alpha$ is not needed for the calculation.)\n\nNow, let's calculate the total proportion of surviving blastocysts. This is the sum of the proportions of all surviving outcomes. Let $P(\\text{survived})$ denote this total proportion.\n$$\nP(\\text{survived}) = \\underbrace{(1-p)v_{E}}_{\\text{Euploid from normal oocyte}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{2}{3}prv_{E}}_{\\text{Euploid from rescue}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{3}prv_{U}}_{\\text{UPD from rescue}} + \\underbrace{p(1-r)v_{T}}_{\\text{Trisomic (no rescue)}}\n$$\nThe proportion of surviving blastocysts that are trisomic is what we calculated in Sub-pathway 2a. Let this be $P(\\text{trisomic and survived})$.\n$$\nP(\\text{trisomic and survived}) = p(1-r)v_{T}\n$$\nThe final desired proportion, $\\Pi_{T}$, is the ratio of these two quantities.\n$$\n\\Pi_{T} = \\frac{P(\\text{trisomic and survived})}{P(\\text{survived})} = \\frac{p(1-r)v_{T}}{(1-p)v_{E} + \\frac{2}{3}prv_{E} + \\frac{1}{3}prv_{U} + p(1-r)v_{T}}\n$$\nWe can substitute the given numerical values:\n$p = 4.0 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.004$\n$r = 0.40$\n$v_{E} = 0.80$\n$v_{T} = 0.050$\n$v_{U} = 0.70$\n$1-p = 0.996$\n$1-r = 0.60$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = p(1-r)v_{T} = (0.004)(0.60)(0.050) = 0.00012\n$$\nNext, calculate the terms in the denominator:\n$$\n\\text{Term 1 (Euploid from normal): } (1-p)v_{E} = (0.996)(0.80) = 0.7968\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Term 2 (Euploid from rescue): } \\frac{2}{3}prv_{E} = \\frac{2}{3}(0.004)(0.40)(0.80) = \\frac{2}{3}(0.00128) = \\frac{0.00256}{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Term 3 (UPD from rescue): } \\frac{1}{3}prv_{U} = \\frac{1}{3}(0.004)(0.40)(0.70) = \\frac{1}{3}(0.00112) = \\frac{0.00112}{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Term 4 (Trisomic): } p(1-r)v_{T} = (0.004)(0.60)(0.050) = 0.00012\n$$\nNow, sum the terms for the denominator:\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = 0.7968 + \\frac{0.00256}{3} + \\frac{0.00112}{3} + 0.00012\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = 0.7968 + \\frac{0.00368}{3} + 0.00012\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = 0.7968 + 0.00122666... + 0.00012 = 0.79814666...\n$$\nFinally, compute the proportion $\\Pi_{T}$:\n$$\n\\Pi_{T} = \\frac{0.00012}{0.79814666...} \\approx 0.0001503463\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Pi_{T} \\approx 0.0001503\n$$\nThis can be expressed in scientific notation as $1.503 \\times 10^{-4}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.503 \\times 10^{-4}}\n$$", "id": "4413484"}, {"introduction": "In clinical practice, a foundational understanding of aneuploidy must be paired with the ability to interpret modern screening technologies.
