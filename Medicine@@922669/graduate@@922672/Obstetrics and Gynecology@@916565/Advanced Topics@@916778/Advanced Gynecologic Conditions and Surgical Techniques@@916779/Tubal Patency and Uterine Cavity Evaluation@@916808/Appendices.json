For the numerator, we have $P(D | T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} | D) P(D)}{P(T^{+})}$. For the denominator, we can write a corresponding form for the probability of no disease given a positive test: $P(\\neg D | T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} | \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}{P(T^{+})}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the post-test odds expression:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{\\frac{P(T^{+} | D) P(D)}{P(T^{+})}}{\\frac{P(T^{+} | \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}{P(T^{+})}}$$\n\nThe term for the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^{+})$, cancels out from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{P(T^{+} | D) P(D)}{P(T^{+} | \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}$$\n\nRearranging the terms to group the ratios:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\left( \\frac{P(T^{+} | D)}{P(T^{+} | \\neg D)} \\right) \\left( \\frac{P(D)}{P(\\neg D)} \\right)$$\n\nBy substituting the definitions of the positive likelihood ratio and pretest odds, we arrive at the desired relationship:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{LR}^{+} \\times \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}}$$\nThis completes the derivation part of the problem.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Post-Test Probability**\n\nWe now apply this derived relationship to compute the post-test probability, $P(D|T^{+})$.\n\n1.  **Calculate Pretest Odds ($\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}}$)**:\n    -   Given $P(D) = 0.25$.\n    -   The probability of not having the disease is $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n    -   $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(\\neg D)} = \\frac{0.25}{0.75} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Positive Likelihood Ratio (LR$^{+}$)**:\n    -   The numerator is the sensitivity, $P(T^{+} | D) = 0.65$.\n    -   The denominator, $P(T^{+} | \\neg D)$, is the false positive rate. It is related to the specificity, $P(T^{-} | \\neg D) = 0.83$. Since a patient either tests positive or negative, $P(T^{+} | \\neg D) + P(T^{-} | \\neg D) = 1$.\n    -   Therefore, $P(T^{+} | \\neg D) = 1 - P(T^{-} | \\neg D) = 1 - 0.83 = 0.17$.\n    -   $\\text{LR}^{+} = \\frac{P(T^{+} | D)}{P(T^{+} | \\neg D)} = \\frac{0.65}{0.17}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Post-Test Odds ($\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}$)**:\n    -   Using the derived formula: $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{LR}^{+} \\times \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}}$.\n    -   $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.17} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) = \\frac{0.65}{0.51}$.\n\n4.  **Convert Post-Test Odds to Post-Test Probability**:\n    -   The relationship between probability ($p$) and odds is $p = \\frac{\\text{odds}}{1 + \\text{odds}}$.\n    -   Therefore, the post-test probability is $P(D | T^{+}) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}$.\n    -   $P(D | T^{+}) = \\frac{\\frac{0.65}{0.51}}{1 + \\frac{0.65}{0.51}} = \\frac{\\frac{0.65}{0.51}}{\\frac{0.51 + 0.65}{0.51}} = \\frac{0.65}{0.51 + 0.65} = \\frac{0.65}{1.16}$.\n\n5.  **Final Numerical Calculation**:\n    -   $P(D | T^{+}) = \\frac{0.65}{1.16} \\approx 0.560344827...$\n    -   Rounding to four significant figures, we get $0.5603$.\n\nThus, for a patient with a positive HSG, the probability of having true tubal occlusion increases from a pretest probability of $0.25$ to a post-test probability of approximately $0.5603$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5603}\n$$", "id": "4518215"}, {"introduction": "Clinical decisions are rarely based on a single test result; they require the synthesis of information from the patient's history, physical examination, and multiple diagnostic tests.

A more formal derivation from first principles considers the harm of an unnecessary procedure. If the disease is absent (with probability $1-p$), the harm is $C_L$. If the disease is present (with probability $p$), the procedure is necessary, and this pathway leads to the correct treatment, so the relative harm from the *decision itself* is $0$. The expected harm is thus $E[\\text{Harm}(\\text{Laparoscopy})] = p \\cdot 0 + (1-p)C_L = (1-p)C_L$.\n\n-   **Action 2: Proceed with noninvasive testing.** The harm in this pathway, $C_M$, occurs if the disease is actually present (with probability $p$), leading to delay and potential mismanagement. If the disease is absent (with probability $1-p$), this is the correct pathway, so the relative harm is $0$. The expected harm is thus $E[\\text{Harm}(\\text{Noninvasive})] = p \\cdot C_M + (1-p) \\cdot 0 = p C_M$.\n\nThe decision threshold, $p^{\\ast}$, is the probability at which we are indifferent between the two actions, i.e., where their expected harms are equal.\n$$\nE[\\text{Harm}(\\text{Laparoscopy})] = E[\\text{Harm}(\\text{Noninvasive})]\n$$\n$$\n(1-p^{\\ast})C_L = p^{\\ast} C_M\n$$\n$$\nC_L - p^{\\ast}C_L = p^{\\ast}C_M\n$$\n$$\nC_L = p^{\\ast}(C_L + C_M)\n$$\n$$\np^{\\ast} = \\frac{C_L}{C_L + C_M}\n$$\nIf the patient's posterior probability $p$ is greater than $p^{\\ast}$, then $p C_M > (1-p)C_L$, meaning the expected harm of the noninvasive path is higher, so we should choose laparoscopy.\n\n**2.

Therefore, the algorithm prioritizes a noninvasive patency test.\n\n-   **Plan for Uterine Cavity Evaluation:**\n    The initial TVUS showed a normal uterine contour without intracavitary lesions. Noninvasive tubal patency tests such as Hysterosalpingo-Contrast Sonography (HyCoSy) or Hysterosalpingography (HSG) also provide an image of the uterine cavity. A reasonable clinical plan would be to proceed with one of these tests. If the imaging of the cavity from HyCoSy/HSG raises new suspicion of a lesion, a dedicated uterine cavity evaluation like saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) or office hysteroscopy would then be warranted. It is not necessary to plan for SIS upfront given the normal initial TVUS.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

However, it makes a category error by comparing odds ($1/3$) with a probability threshold ($p^{\\ast}=0.30$). Odds and probabilities are not directly comparable on the same scale. The odds of $1/3$ correspond to a probability of $0.25$, which is *less than* the threshold. The comparison is invalid, leading to the wrong conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Use CAT alone to compute the positive predictive value from sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence, obtaining approximately $0.46$, treat this as definitive, and prioritize laparoscopy without integrating TVUS or history.**\n\nThis option correctly calculates the posterior probability using only the CAT result ($P(D|\\text{CAT+}) \\approx 0.46$). However, its core flaw is failing to incorporate all available evidence as instructed by the problem statement (\"integrate... CAT... TVUS, and clinical history\"). Ignoring relevant clinical information (the reassuring TVUS finding) is a significant methodological error.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Multiply $LR_{+}$ for CAT and clinical history and use $LR_{+}$ for TVUS despite absent hydrosalpinx, yielding $P(D \\mid \\text{evidence}) \\approx 0.97$, which exceeds the threshold; therefore, prioritize laparoscopy and defer uterine cavity evaluation to intraoperative hysteroscopy.**\n\nThis option makes a critical error by using the positive likelihood ratio ($LR_{+}$) for a negative test result (absent hydrosalpinx on TVUS). For a negative finding, the negative likelihood ratio ($LR_{-}$) must be used. This error dramatically and incorrectly inflates the posterior probability, leading to the wrong conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4518245"}, {"introduction": "Beyond diagnostic accuracy, the responsible practice of medicine demands a commitment to patient safety. Procedures involving ionizing radiation, such as Hysterosalpingography (HSG), require a firm grasp of dosimetry principles to minimize risk. This hands-on calculation focuses on the practical task of quantifying a patient's cumulative radiation dose during an HSG, ensuring it remains within established institutional safety limits, known as Diagnostic Reference Levels (DRLs) [@problem_id:4518210].", "problem": "A patient undergoes Hysterosalpingography (HSG), a fluoroscopic evaluation of tubal patency and the uterine cavity. The system is operated in pulsed fluoroscopy at $7.5$ pulses per second for a continuous fluoroscopy time of $60$ seconds. The measured entrance skin dose per pulse at the reference point is $0.5$ milligray (mGy). In addition to fluoroscopy, a cine acquisition contributes an extra fixed entrance dose of $10$ mGy. The institutional Diagnostic Reference Level (DRL) for cumulative entrance skin dose at the reference point during HSG at your center is $300$ mGy.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of dose accumulation (that cumulative dose arises from summing the dose from each pulse during fluoroscopy and adding any separate acquisition contributions), calculate the cumulative entrance skin dose at the reference point for this HSG. Express your final answer in milligray (mGy), and round to three significant figures. Then, based on the calculated value, assess whether the cumulative entrance skin dose is within the institutional DRL of $300$ mGy.", "solution": "The problem is validated as sound. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of medical physics, specifically radiation dosimetry. All provided data are self-consistent, physically plausible, and sufficient for a unique solution. The problem is well-posed, objective, and directly relevant to the clinical practice of evaluating tubal patency and the uterine cavity, specifically through Hysterosalpingography (HSG).\n\nThe task is to calculate the total cumulative entrance skin dose, denoted as $D_{total}$, for the described HSG procedure. This total dose is the sum of the dose from the pulsed fluoroscopy, $D_{fluoro}$, and the dose from the separate cine acquisition, $D_{cine}$.\n\nThe relationship is given by the fundamental principle of dose accumulation:\n$$\nD_{total} = D_{fluoro} + D_{cine}\n$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dose from the fluoroscopy component, $D_{fluoro}$. This dose is determined by the total number of radiation pulses delivered during the fluoroscopy time, multiplied by the dose delivered per pulse.\n\nLet $R_p$ be the pulse rate, $t_{fluoro}$ be the duration of fluoroscopy, and $d_{pulse}$ be the entrance skin dose per pulse. The givens are:\n- Pulse rate, $R_p = 7.5$ pulses/second\n- Fluoroscopy time, $t_{fluoro} = 60$ seconds\n- Dose per pulse, $d_{pulse} = 0.5$ mGy/pulse\n\nThe total number of pulses, $N_p$, is the product of the pulse rate and the fluoroscopy time:\n$$\nN_p = R_p \\times t_{fluoro}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nN_p = (7.5 \\text{ pulses/s}) \\times (60 \\text{ s}) = 450 \\text{ pulses}\n$$\n\nThe total dose from fluoroscopy, $D_{fluoro}$, is the product of the total number of pulses and the dose per pulse:\n$$\nD_{fluoro} = N_p \\times d_{pulse}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated $N_p$ and the given $d_{pulse}$:\n$$\nD_{fluoro} = (450 \\text{ pulses}) \\times (0.5 \\text{ mGy/pulse}) = 225 \\text{ mGy}\n$$\n\nNext, we account for the additional dose from the cine acquisition. The problem states this is a fixed contribution:\n- Cine acquisition dose, $D_{cine} = 10$ mGy\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cumulative entrance skin dose, $D_{total}$, by summing the fluoroscopy and cine components:\n$$\nD_{total} = D_{fluoro} + D_{cine} = 225 \\text{ mGy} + 10 \\text{ mGy} = 235 \\text{ mGy}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $235$ mGy already consists of three significant figures ($2$, $3$, and $5$), so no further rounding is necessary. The cumulative entrance skin dose is $235$ mGy.\n\nThe final part of the task is to assess this value against the institutional Diagnostic Reference Level (DRL). The given DRL is:\n- DRL = $300$ mGy\n\nWe compare the calculated total dose to the DRL:\n$$\nD_{total} = 235 \\text{ mGy}\n$$\n$$\nDRL = 300 \\text{ mGy}\n$$\nSince $235 < 300$, the calculated cumulative entrance skin dose for this procedure is within the institutional DRL.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{235}$$", "id": "4518210"}]}
