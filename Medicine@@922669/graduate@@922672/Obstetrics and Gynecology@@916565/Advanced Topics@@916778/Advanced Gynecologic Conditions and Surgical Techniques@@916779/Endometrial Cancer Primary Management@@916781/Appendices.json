Provide the final numerical values of $PPV$ and $NPV$ as decimals rounded to four significant figures, without a percent sign, and present them in the order $\\big(PPV,\\,NPV\\big)$.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) for a diagnostic test, followed by a clinical interpretation of the results. The problem is well-posed and provides all necessary information.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has deep myometrial invasion, and let $D^c$ be the event that a patient does not have deep myometrial invasion. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive MRI result, and $T^-$ be the event of a negative MRI result.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n1.  The prevalence of deep myometrial invasion, $p = P(D) = 0.30$. The probability of not having the condition is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the MRI, $S = P(T^+ | D) = 0.85$. This is the probability of a positive test given that the disease is present.\n3.  The specificity of the MRI, $C = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.80$. This is the probability of a negative test given that the disease is absent.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can also derive the probabilities of incorrect test results:\n- The false positive rate is the probability of a positive test given the absence of disease: $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - C = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$.\n- The false negative rate is the probability of a negative test given the presence of disease: $P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - S = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is the probability that a patient has the disease given a positive test result, i.e., $PPV = P(D | T^+)$.\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test, which can be found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the known symbolic representations:\n$$P(T^+) = S \\cdot p + (1 - C) \\cdot (1 - p)$$\nTherefore, the analytical expression for PPV is:\n$$PPV = \\frac{S \\cdot p}{S \\cdot p + (1 - C) \\cdot (1 - p)}$$\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value (NPV) is the probability that a patient does not have the disease given a negative test result, i.e., $NPV = P(D^c | T^-)$.\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test, found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)$$\nSubstituting the known symbolic representations:\n$$P(T^-) = C \\cdot (1 - p) + (1 - S) \\cdot p$$\nTherefore, the analytical expression for NPV is:\n$$NPV = \\frac{C \\cdot (1 - p)}{C \\cdot (1 - p) + (1 - S) \\cdot p}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values using the given data: $S=0.85$, $C=0.80$, and $p=0.30$.\nFor PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.85) \\cdot (0.30)}{(0.85) \\cdot (0.30) + (1 - 0.80) \\cdot (1 - 0.30)} = \\frac{0.255}{0.255 + (0.20) \\cdot (0.70)} = \\frac{0.255}{0.255 + 0.140} = \\frac{0.255}{0.395}$$\n$$PPV \\approx 0.6455696...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $PPV \\approx 0.6456$.\n\nFor NPV:\n$$NPV = \\frac{(0.80) \\cdot (1 - 0.30)}{(0.80) \\cdot (1 - 0.30) + (1 - 0.85) \\cdot (0.30)} = \\frac{(0.80) \\cdot (0.70)}{(0.80) \\cdot (0.70) + (0.15) \\cdot (0.30)} = \\frac{0.560}{0.560 + 0.045} = \\frac{0.560}{0.605}$$\n$$NPV \\approx 0.9256198...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $NPV \\approx 0.9256$.\n\nInterpretation of these values for surgical planning:\nA PPV of $0.6456$ indicates that for a patient in this population with a positive MRI result, there is approximately a $65\\%$ probability of having true deep myometrial invasion. While this is a substantial increase from the baseline prevalence of $30\\%$, it also implies a $1 - 0.6456 = 35.44\\%$ chance that the result is a false positive. Therefore, a positive MRI cannot be considered definitive proof of deep invasion. For surgical planning, this elevated risk justifies preparing for a comprehensive staging procedure. The preoperative consent should include the possibility of a full pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, which is indicated for high-risk endometrial cancer. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping would still be performed as the initial step in lymphatic assessment, but the surgeon and patient must be prepared for escalation to a full lymphadenectomy if SLNs are positive or if intraoperative assessment (e.g., frozen section of the uterus) confirms deep invasion.\n\nAn NPV of $0.9256$ indicates that for a patient with a negative MRI result, there is approximately a $93\\%$ probability that they do not have deep myometrial invasion. This is a high degree of certainty and makes the test very useful for ruling out high-risk disease. The probability of having deep invasion despite a negative MRI (the false negative rate in this context, $1 - NPV$) is only about $7\\%$. This high NPV provides strong support for a more conservative surgical approach. The plan would typically involve SLN mapping alone, with a high likelihood that a full lymphadenectomy can be avoided if the SLNs are negative. This strategy minimizes surgical morbidity for the majority of patients with a negative preoperative MRI. Nonetheless, the patient must be consented for the small but non-zero possibility that intraoperative findings might unexpectedly reveal high-risk features, necessitating an extended staging procedure. The preoperative counseling can frame this as a low-probability event.\n\nIn summary, the MRI serves as a powerful risk stratification tool. A positive result significantly raises the index of suspicion and guides preparation for a potentially extensive operation, while a negative result provides strong reassurance and supports planning for a less morbid, more targeted surgical procedure.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.6456  0.9256\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4431826"}, {"introduction": "Following surgical resection, the cornerstone of management is accurate pathological staging using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) system.

It uses standard terminology, describes a realistic clinical scenario, and relies on the universally accepted FIGO staging system for endometrial cancer. The pathological findings are a standard set of data used for this purpose. The problem is scientifically and factually sound.\n*   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a complete and consistent set of pathological data required for surgical staging. The FIGO staging system has a hierarchical structure, meaning the most advanced pathological feature determines the final stage. This ensures that a single, unique stage can be determined from the given information.\n*   **Objectivity:** The problem statement is objective and devoid of subjective or ambiguous language. It presents quantitative measurements (e.g., invasion depth) and precise qualitative findings (e.g., \"no cervical stromal invasion\").\n\n**Verdict:** The problem statement is **valid**. It is a clear, scientifically sound, and well-posed question that can be answered by applying the established principles of the FIGO staging system.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe FIGO staging for endometrial carcinoma is a surgical-pathological system. The final stage is assigned based on the most advanced finding, following a hierarchical progression from Stage I to Stage IV.\n\n1.  **Assessment of Uterine-Confined Disease (Stage I):**\n    *   Stage I disease is confined to the uterine corpus.\n    *   The depth of myometrial invasion determines the substage. The fractional invasion is calculated as $\\frac{\\text{depth of invasion}}{\\text{total myometrial thickness}} = \\frac{4\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{10\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = 0.4$.\n    *   This represents $40\\%$ myometrial invasion.\n    *   Since the invasion is less than half ($50\\%$), if the tumor were confined to the uterus, it would be **Stage IA**.\n    *   Stage IB requires invasion of $\\ge 50\\%$ of the myometrium. This is not met.\n\n2.  **Assessment of Cervical Stromal Invasion (Stage II):**\n    *   Stage II is defined by tumor invasion of the cervical stroma, but without extension beyond the uterus.\n    *   The pathology report explicitly states, \"no cervical stromal invasion\". The presence of tumor in the endocervical mucosa or glands alone, without stromal invasion, does not constitute Stage II disease.\n    *   Therefore, the criteria for Stage II are not met.\n\n3.  **Assessment of Local and Regional Spread (Stage III):**\n    *   Stage III denotes local and/or regional spread of the tumor. It is subdivided based on the site of spread.\n    *   **Stage IIIA:** Tumor invades the uterine serosa and/or adnexa (ovaries or fallopian tubes).\n        *   The report documents: \"Foci of tumor involving the uterine serosal surface are present.\" This finding, by itself, qualifies for Stage IIIA.\n        *   The report also documents: \"A $\\approx 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ parenchymal focus of carcinoma is identified in the left ovary... consistent with metastasis.\" This adnexal metastasis, by itself, also qualifies for Stage IIIA.\n        *   Since the patient has both serosal involvement and an ovarian metastasis, the criteria for Stage IIIA are unequivocally met.\n    *   **Stage IIIB:** Tumor involves the vagina and/or parametrium. There is no information suggesting this, so this stage is not applicable.\n    *   **Stage IIIC:** Metastasis to lymph nodes.\n        *   Stage IIIC1: Metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes.\n        *   Stage IIIC2: Metastasis to para-aortic lymph nodes.\n        *   The report states that both pelvic and para-aortic sentinel lymph nodes are negative. Therefore, the criteria for Stage IIIC are not met.\n\n4.  **Assessment of Bladder/Bowel Invasion or Distant Metastasis (Stage IV):**\n    *   **Stage IVA:** Tumor invades bladder and/or bowel mucosa. The report explicitly rules this out.\n    *   **Stage IVB:** Distant metastases, including intra-abdominal metastases (e.g., omentum) and/or inguinal lymph nodes. The omentum was negative, and no other distant lesions were identified. Therefore, Stage IVB is not applicable.\n\n5.  **Note on Peritoneal Cytology:**\n    *   The finding of \"malignant cells consistent with carcinoma\" in a peritoneal wash is noted.\n    *   Under the 1988 FIGO staging system, this finding would have automatically upstaged the cancer to Stage IIIA. However, since the 2009 revision, positive peritoneal cytology is recorded as a prognostic factor but **does not** change the FIGO stage. This principle is maintained in the 2023 update.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:**\nThe staging is determined by the most advanced pathological feature. The patient has findings consistent with Stage IA (myometrial invasion $50\\%$) but also has findings that define Stage IIIA (serosal involvement and ovarian metastasis). According to the hierarchical nature of the FIGO system, the highest stage designation applies. The presence of uterine serosal involvement and/or adnexal metastasis firmly places this patient's cancer at **FIGO Stage IIIA**.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A. FIGO Stage IB:** This is defined as tumor confined to the uterus with $\\ge 50\\%$ myometrial invasion. The patient has $50\\%$ invasion ($40\\%$) and the tumor is not confined to the uterus (it involves the serosa and ovary). This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B. FIGO Stage II:** This is defined by cervical stromal invasion. The pathology report explicitly states there is no cervical stromal invasion. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. FIGO Stage IIIA:** This is defined by tumor invading the uterine serosa and/or adnexa. The pathology report confirms both uterine serosal involvement and a metastasis to the left ovary. This option accurately reflects the most advanced disease feature found. This option is **Correct**.\n\n*   **D. FIGO Stage IIIC1:** This is defined by metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes. The pathology report states that pelvic lymph nodes were negative. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E. FIGO Stage IVA:** This is defined by tumor invasion of the bladder and/or bowel mucosa. The pathology report explicitly rules this out.

Classify as high-intermediate risk due to LVSI; recommend pelvic External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) and consider systemic chemotherapy; nodal staging is not necessary.\n\nD. NSMP confers higher-than-clinicopathologic risk; recommend sentinel lymph node mapping or completion lymphadenectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy despite stage $\\mathrm{IA}$ disease.", "solution": "The task requires integrating clinicopathologic factors with molecular subclass to stratify risk and derive management. The fundamental base comprises: patterns of spread (locoregional and lymphatic), the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage definition for stage $\\mathrm{IA}$ (less than $50\\%$ myometrial invasion), the prognostic and predictive meaning of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) by extent (focal versus substantial), and the established integrated risk classification endorsed by European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO), European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO), and European Society of Pathology (ESP), which incorporates The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) molecular subtypes (POLE-mutated, mismatch repair deficient, p53-abnormal, and No Specific Molecular Profile (NSMP)).\n\nStep $1$: Establish clinicopathologic risk without molecular data. The tumor is endometrioid, FIGO stage $\\mathrm{IA}$ (less than $50\\%$ myometrial invasion), grade $2$, with LVSI present but focal. In widely adopted clinicopathologic frameworks, LVSI extent matters: focal LVSI (a few vessels) has a weaker association with nodal and distant spread compared to substantial LVSI (diffuse or multifocal). For endometrioid stage $\\mathrm{IA}$ grade $1$–$2$ with LVSI negative or focal, the expected risk of nodal metastasis and pelvic recurrence is low. Thus, on clinicopathologic grounds alone, this constellation aligns with a low-risk or at most favorable-intermediate risk categorization, not high-intermediate, because substantial LVSI is absent and invasion is less than $50\\%$.\n\nStep $2$: Incorporate molecular subclass. Molecular profiling shows wild-type p53, intact mismatch repair proteins (not mismatch repair deficient), and no DNA Polymerase Epsilon (POLE) exonuclease domain mutation, yielding an NSMP classification. In the integrated risk model, NSMP does not by itself escalate risk; rather, it maintains clinicopathologic risk determinations for endometrioid tumors. Specifically, for endometrioid carcinoma that is FIGO stage $\\mathrm{IA}$, grade $1$–$2$, with LVSI negative or focal, the ESGO/ESTRO/ESP integrated classification places the tumor in the low-risk group when the molecular subtype is NSMP. By contrast, p53-abnormal status would elevate risk (even in early stage), and POLE-mutated status would de-escalate to an ultralow-risk scenario. Therefore, with NSMP and focal LVSI, the patient remains low risk.\n\nStep $3$: Derive nodal assessment implications from the risk group. The purpose of nodal staging is to detect occult nodal disease when the pretest probability is sufficiently high to alter adjuvant therapy. In low-risk endometrioid carcinoma (FIGO stage $\\mathrm{IA}$, grade $1$–$2$, LVSI negative or focal, NSMP), the likelihood of nodal metastasis is low enough that omission of nodal staging is acceptable. Sentinel lymph node mapping is the preferred method of nodal assessment when indicated because it reduces morbidity compared with systematic lymphadenectomy; however, in low-risk cases, nodal staging is not required. Because no sentinel mapping was performed initially, and the final integrated risk is low, there is no indication for a completion lymphadenectomy or delayed sentinel mapping.\n\nStep $4$: Derive adjuvant therapy implications from the risk group. For low-risk endometrioid carcinoma per the integrated model, adjuvant therapy (vaginal brachytherapy, pelvic External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT), or systemic chemotherapy) is not recommended. Observation is standard, as adjuvant radiation offers minimal absolute benefit in recurrence reduction and carries toxicity. Substantial LVSI would be a key escalator prompting at least vaginal brachytherapy or EBRT; focal LVSI does not trigger such escalation in the integrated schema for NSMP tumors.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- Option A: This option classifies the patient as low risk in the integrated ESGO/ESTRO/ESP model (endometrioid, FIGO stage $\\mathrm{IA}$, grade $2$, LVSI focal, NSMP), recommends no further nodal staging given low nodal risk, and advises no adjuvant therapy (observation). This precisely follows the derived conclusions. Verdict — Correct.\n- Option B: This asserts intermediate risk due to LVSI and recommends both completion pelvic lymphadenectomy and adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy. This misinterprets focal LVSI as sufficient to upstage risk and also recommends a completion lymphadenectomy, which is not indicated in low-risk disease. Verdict — Incorrect.\n- Option C: This asserts high-intermediate risk and recommends pelvic EBRT and consideration of chemotherapy, which is disproportionate to the risk in stage $\\mathrm{IA}$ grade $2$ endometrioid carcinoma with focal LVSI and NSMP. High-intermediate risk would require substantial LVSI or other adverse features not present here. Verdict — Incorrect.\n- Option D: This claims NSMP confers higher-than-clinicopathologic risk and recommends nodal staging and chemotherapy. NSMP does not independently escalate risk; it is the default group that largely adheres to clinicopathologic risk. Chemotherapy is not indicated in this low-risk setting.
