The EAUS demonstrates full-thickness external anal sphincter defects with the following clock-face spans at each axial level (clock-face referenced to the anal canal center with $12{:}00$ anterior, hours increasing clockwise, and half-hours at $15^{\\circ}$ increments):\n\n- Superior level: from $11{:}00$ to $3{:}00$.\n- Mid level: from $11{:}30$ to $1{:}30$.\n- Inferior level: two non-overlapping arcs, from $12{:}00$ to $1{:}00$ and from $3{:}30$ to $4{:}30$.\n\nAxial T2-weighted MRI segmentation yields the external anal sphincter radii measured from the lumen center to the outer muscle boundary at each level:\n- Superior level radius $r_{1} = 11\\,\\mathrm{mm}$,\n- Mid level radius $r_{2} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$,\n- Inferior level radius $r_{3} = 9\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nUsing only the geometric definitions of circle circumference $C$ and circular arc length $s$ together with the mapping from clock-face notation to central angles, construct from first principles an analytically justified single scalar metric $f$ that quantifies the aggregated circumferential involvement of full-thickness external anal sphincter defect across the three levels. Treat each axial level as a ring with radius $r_{i}$, and assume the defects are the only involved arcs at those levels and do not overlap within a level. For clock-face intervals that cross $12{:}00$, measure the central angle by wrapping through $0^{\\circ}$ as appropriate.

The area at rest is:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{rest}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} d_{\\mathrm{AP,rest}} d_{\\mathrm{LR,rest}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} (N_{\\mathrm{AP,rest}} \\cdot s_{\\mathrm{AP}}) ((N_{\\mathrm{LR,rest}} \\cdot s_{\\mathrm{LR}}) \\cdot k)$$\nFor the squeeze state, the pixel counts are $N_{\\mathrm{AP,sq}} = 89$ and $N_{\\mathrm{LR,sq}} = 78$. The area at squeeze is:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{sq}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} d_{\\mathrm{AP,sq}} d_{\\mathrm{LR,sq}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} (N_{\\mathrm{AP,sq}} \\cdot s_{\\mathrm{AP}}) ((N_{\\mathrm{LR,sq}} \\cdot s_{\\mathrm{LR}}) \\cdot k)$$\n\nThe contractile percent change $C$ can be rewritten as:\n$$C = 1 - \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{sq}}}{A_{\\mathrm{rest}}}$$\nWe substitute the expressions for $A_{\\mathrm{rest}}$ and $A_{\\mathrm{sq}}$ into this formula:\n$$C = 1 - \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{4} (N_{\\mathrm{AP,sq}} \\cdot s_{\\mathrm{AP}}) ((N_{\\mathrm{LR,sq}} \\cdot s_{\\mathrm{LR}}) \\cdot k)}{\\frac{\\pi}{4} (N_{\\mathrm{AP,rest}} \\cdot s_{\\mathrm{AP}}) ((N_{\\mathrm{LR,rest}} \\cdot s_{\\mathrm{LR}}) \\cdot k)}$$\nThe constant terms $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$, $s_{\\mathrm{AP}}$, $s_{\\mathrm{LR}}$, and $k$ are present in both the numerator and the denominator, so they cancel out. This demonstrates that for this ratiometric calculation, the result depends only on the raw pixel counts.\n$$C = 1 - \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{AP,sq}} \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{LR,sq}}}{N_{\\mathrm{AP,rest}} \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{LR,rest}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the pixel counts:\n$N_{\\mathrm{AP,rest}} = 118$\n$N_{\\mathrm{LR,rest}} = 96$\n$N_{\\mathrm{AP,sq}} = 89$\n$N_{\\mathrm{LR,sq}} = 78$\n\n$$C = 1 - \\frac{89 \\times 78}{118 \\times 96}$$\nFirst, we compute the products in the numerator and the denominator:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{AP,sq}} \\times N_{\\mathrm{LR,sq}} = 89 \\times 78 = 6942$$\n$$N_{\\mathrm{AP,rest}} \\times N_{\\mathrm{LR,rest}} = 118 \\times 96 = 11328$$\nSubstituting these products back into the expression for $C$:\n$$C = 1 - \\frac{6942}{11328}$$\nTo find the final value, we perform the division and subtraction:\n$$\\frac{6942}{11328} \\approx 0.6128177966$$\n$$C \\approx 1 - 0.6128177966 = 0.3871822034$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures of $C$ are $3$, $8$, $7$, and $1$. The fifth significant digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$C \\approx 0.3872$$\nThis is the contractile percent change, expressed as a decimal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3872}$$", "id": "4400245"}]}
