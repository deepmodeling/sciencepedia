Absolute Uterine Factor Infertility (AUFI) is defined as infertility due to the complete absence of a functional uterus, for example in congenital absence as in Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH) or acquired absence following hysterectomy performed during reproductive age. Consider a closed cohort of $200{,}000$ reproductive-aged women. Within this cohort, there are $40$ women with congenital uterine absence due to Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH) and $60$ women who underwent hysterectomy during reproductive age.

The context, evaluating the burden of a condition for a potential new treatment program (uterine transplantation), is clinically relevant and sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary data are provided. The total population, the number of cases for each subtype of the condition, and the relationship between the subtypes (mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive) are explicitly stated.

The problem states that AUFI in this cohort is caused by either congenital absence (MRKH) or acquired absence (hysterectomy). It is also given that these two causes are mutually exclusive (an individual cannot have both) and collectively exhaustive (there are no other causes of AUFI in this cohort). Therefore, the total number of AUFI cases is the sum of the cases from each cause.\n\n$$C_{AUFI} = C_{MRKH} + C_{Hyst}$$\n\nThe givens are $C_{MRKH} = 40$ and $C_{Hyst} = 60$. Substituting these values:\n\n$$C_{AUFI} = 40 + 60 = 100$$\n\nThe total population at risk, $N$, is given as $200,000$.\n\nNow, the point prevalence $P$ can be calculated:\n\n$$P = \\frac{C_{AUFI}}{N} = \\frac{100}{200,000}$$\n\nSimplifying this fraction:\n\n$$P = \\frac{1}{2,000}$$\n\nThe problem requires the prevalence to be expressed as the number of cases per $10,000$ women.

The odds of an event, $O$, are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring, $P$, to the probability of the event not occurring, $1-P$.\n$$ O = \\frac{P}{1-P} $$\nConversely, the probability can be expressed in terms of the odds:\n$$ P = \\frac{O}{1+O} $$\n\nThe problem provides the baseline probability of preterm birth in the general obstetric population as $P_{baseline}$.\n$$ P_{baseline} = 0.10 $$\nFrom this, we can calculate the baseline odds of preterm birth, $O_{baseline}$.\n$$ O_{baseline} = \\frac{P_{baseline}}{1 - P_{baseline}} = \\frac{0.10}{1 - 0.10} = \\frac{0.10}{0.90} = \\frac{1}{9} $$\n\nNext, the problem provides an Odds Ratio, $OR$, of $2.5$ for preterm birth in pregnancies achieved after UT compared to the baseline population. The $OR$ is the ratio of the odds of the event in the exposed group (post-UT) to the odds of the event in the unexposed group (baseline). Let $O_{post-UT}$ represent the odds of preterm birth after UT.\n$$ OR = \\frac{O_{post-UT}}{O_{baseline}} $$\nWe are given $OR = 2.5$.

The calculated absolute probability of preterm birth after uterine transplantation is approximately $0.2174$. For effective counseling, this absolute risk must be compared with the baseline absolute risk of $0.10$ in the general population. The interpretation is as follows: The baseline risk of preterm birth is $1$ in $10$ (or $10$ out of $100$ pregnancies). After uterine transplantation, this absolute risk increases to approximately $0.2174$, which is about $22$ in $100$ pregnancies.

Let us define the relevant events:\n- Let $R$ be the event that a patient has clinically significant rejection.\n- Let $R^c$ be the event that a patient does not have clinically significant rejection.\n- Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result (an abnormal Doppler ultrasonography, DUS).\n- Let $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result (a normal DUS).\n\nThe problem provides the following information, which we translate into probabilistic terms:\n- The sensitivity is the probability of a positive test given the condition is present: $P(T^+ | R) = 0.80$.\n- The specificity is the probability of a negative test given the condition is absent: $P(T^- | R^c) = 0.85$.\n- The prevalence is the prior probability of the condition: $P(R) = 0.15$.\n\nFrom the prevalence, we can determine the prior probability of not having the condition. Since $R$ and $R^c$ are complementary events, the sum of their probabilities is $1$.\n$$P(R^c) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$$\n\nOur goal is to find the probability of not having rejection given a negative test result, which is the conditional probability $P(R^c | T^-)$. This quantity is also known as the Negative Predictive Value (NPV).\n\nFollowing the prompt's instruction to start from first principles, we begin with the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(R^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(R^c \\cap T^-)}{P(T^-)}$$\nHere, $P(R^c \\cap T^-)$ is the joint probability of not having rejection and receiving a negative test result.\n\nTo evaluate the numerator, $P(R^c \\cap T^-)$, we can rearrange the definition of conditional probability for $P(T^- | R^c)$:\n$$P(T^- | R^c) = \\frac{P(T^- \\cap R^c)}{P(R^c)}$$\nMultiplying by $P(R^c)$ gives:\n$$P(R^c \\cap T^-) = P(T^- | R^c) \\, P(R^c)$$\nWe are given $P(T^- | R^c)$, which is the specificity, and we have calculated $P(R^c)$.\n\nNext, to evaluate the denominator, $P(T^-)$, we use the law of total probability. The event $T^-$ can be partitioned into two mutually exclusive events: (1) testing negative while having rejection ($T^- \\cap R$) and (2) testing negative while not having rejection ($T^- \\cap R^c$).\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- \\cap R) + P(T^- \\cap R^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term, we get:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | R) \\, P(R) + P(T^- | R^c) \\, P(R^c)$$\n\nWe have most of the terms needed for this expression, but $P(T^- | R)$ is not directly given. However, we are given the sensitivity, $P(T^+ | R) = 0.80$. For a patient who has rejection (the condition for the probability), the test can only be positive or negative. Thus, the events $T^+$ and $T^-$ are complementary within this conditional space.\n$$P(T^+ | R) + P(T^- | R) = 1$$\nTherefore, we can find $P(T^- | R)$, which is the false negative rate:\n$$P(T^- | R) = 1 - P(T^+ | R) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$$\n\nNow we can substitute all the components back into the main expression for $P(R^c | T^-)$:\n$$P(R^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | R^c) \\, P(R^c)}{P(T^- | R) \\, P(R) + P(T^- | R^c) \\, P(R^c)}$$\nThis is the general derived formula. It is an expression of Bayes' theorem.\n\nWe now substitute the numerical values from the problem:\n- $P(R^c) = 0.85$\n- $P(R) = 0.15$\n- $P(T^- | R^c) = \\text{specificity} = 0.85$\n- $P(T^- | R) = 1 - \\text{sensitivity} = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$\n\nPlugging these values into the derived formula:\n$$P(R^c | T^-) = \\frac{(0.85) \\times (0.85)}{(0.20) \\times (0.15) + (0.85) \\times (0.85)}$$\nFirst, we compute the products in the numerator and denominator:\n$$P(R^c | T^-) = \\frac{0.7225}{0.03 + 0.7225}$$\nNow, we complete the addition in the denominator:\n$$P(R^c | T^-) = \\frac{0.7225}{0.7525}$$\nFinally, we perform the division:\n$$P(R^c | T^-) \\approx 0.9601328903654485$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(R^c | T^-) \\approx 0.9601$$\n\nThe derived probability that a patient does not have clinically significant rejection given a normal DUS result is approximately $0.9601$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9601}$$", "id": "4523843"}]}
