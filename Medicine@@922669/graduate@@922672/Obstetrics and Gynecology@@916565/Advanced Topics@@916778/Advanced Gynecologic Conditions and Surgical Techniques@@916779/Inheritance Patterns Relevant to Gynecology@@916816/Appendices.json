In addition, provide a rigorous justification of the assumptions required for the derivation to be valid in the obstetrics and gynecology context under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), without invoking any shortcut formulas.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the probability that a randomly selected woman is affected by an autosomal recessive condition, given the population frequency of the pathogenic allele. The derivation must be based on first principles, and the assumptions underlying the model must be rigorously justified in the specified clinical context.\n\nLet the single autosomal locus have two alleles. We denote the normal allele as $A$ and the pathogenic allele as $a$. The problem states that the population frequency of the pathogenic allele, $a$, is $q$. Since there are only two alleles at this locus, the sum of their frequencies must be equal to $1$. Let the frequency of the normal allele, $A$, be $p$. Therefore, we have the relation:\n$$p + q = 1$$\nFrom this, the frequency of the normal allele can be expressed in terms of $q$ as $p = 1 - q$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds by considering the formation of diploid individuals from the random union of gametes (sperm and oocytes) from the population's gene pool. This principle is a cornerstone of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) model. We assume that the allele frequencies, $p$ and $q$, are the same in the pool of male gametes and the pool of female gametes.\n\nAn individual's genotype is formed by the combination of one allele from a paternal gamete and one allele from a maternal gamete. The probability of a gamete carrying a specific allele is equal to that allele's frequency in the population.\n- The probability of drawing a gamete with allele $A$ is $p$.\n- The probability of drawing a gamete with allele $a$ is $q$.\n\nAssuming the selection of the paternal and maternal gametes are independent events, we can calculate the probabilities, which correspond to the expected frequencies, of the three possible genotypes ($AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$) in the next generation's zygotes:\n\n1.  **Homozygous normal genotype ($AA$):** This genotype results from the fusion of a sperm carrying allele $A$ and an oocyte carrying allele $A$. The probability of this event is the product of the individual probabilities:\n    $$P(AA) = P(\\text{paternal allele is } A) \\times P(\\text{maternal allele is } A) = p \\times p = p^2$$\n\n2.  **Heterozygous genotype ($Aa$):** This genotype can be formed in two mutually exclusive ways:\n    a) A sperm with allele $A$ fertilizes an oocyte with allele $a$. The probability is $p \\times q$.\n    b) A sperm with allele $a$ fertilizes an oocyte with allele $A$. The probability is $q \\times p$.\n    The total probability of forming a heterozygous individual is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n    $$P(Aa) = (p \\times q) + (q \\times p) = 2pq$$\n\n3.  **Homozygous pathogenic genotype ($aa$):** This genotype results from the fusion of a sperm carrying allele $a$ and an oocyte carrying allele $a$. The probability is:\n    $$P(aa) = P(\\text{paternal allele is } a) \\times P(\\text{maternal allele is } a) = q \\times q = q^2$$\n\nThe sum of these genotype frequencies must be $1$: $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = (p+q)^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n\nThe problem states that the condition is autosomal recessive with complete penetrance.\n- **Autosomal recessive** means that an individual must have two copies of the pathogenic allele (genotype $aa$) to express the phenotype. Individuals with genotypes $AA$ or $Aa$ are phenotypically unaffected.\n- **Complete penetrance** means that $100\\%$ of individuals with the predisposing genotype ($aa$) will manifest the condition.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected individual from this population is affected by the condition is equal to the frequency of the $aa$ genotype.\n$$P(\\text{affected}) = P(aa) = q^2$$\nThis derivation provides the frequency of affected zygotes at conception. The problem asks for the probability for a \"woman of reproductive age\". This requires assuming that there is no selection against the $aa$ genotype between conception and reproductive age, which will be discussed below.\n\nThe derivation above relies on the assumptions of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A rigorous justification for these assumptions in the context of obstetrics and gynecology for population-based screening is as follows:\n\n1.  **Random Mating (Panmixia):** The model assumes that individuals choose mates without regard to their genotype at this specific locus. In the context of a recessive condition for which carriers ($Aa$) are phenotypically normal, prospective parents are generally unaware of each other's carrier status. Mating is therefore effectively random with respect to this locus. This assumption holds unless there is significant assortative mating (e.g., due to shared ancestry in a stratified population or affected individuals preferentially mating with other affected individuals) or consanguinity, which increases the incidence of recessive disorders above the baseline $q^2$. For a large, general population screening program, panmixia is a reasonable starting assumption.\n\n2.  **No Natural Selection:** This assumption posits that all genotypes ($AA$, $Aa$, $aa$) have equal rates of survival and reproduction. For a condition that \"impacts gynecologic health,\" this assumption must be carefully evaluated. If the condition causes lethality before reproductive age, the frequency of affected women at that age would be lower than the conception frequency of $q^2$. However, a condition affecting gynecologic health (e.g., causing primary amenorrhea, anatomical abnormalities, or infertility) does not necessarily affect survival to reproductive age. In such cases, the frequency of affected individuals among women of reproductive age would be accurately approximated by $q^2$. Selection would act on the *reproductive fitness* of affected women, which influences allele frequencies in subsequent generations, but not their prevalence at the age of observation. Thus, for calculating prevalence in the current generation of adults, assuming no differential survival is often a valid simplification.\n\n3.  **No Mutation:** The model assumes that the allele frequencies $p$ and $q$ are stable and not altered by new mutations (e.g., $A \\to a$ or $a \\to A$). Spontaneous mutation rates are typically very low, on the order of $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-5}$ per locus per generation. Such a low rate has a negligible effect on allele frequencies from one generation to the next, so ignoring mutation is a standard and valid practice for clinical risk calculations.\n\n4.  **Large Population Size:** The population is assumed to be large enough to prevent stochastic changes in allele frequencies due to random sampling effects, a phenomenon known as genetic drift. Population-based screening programs are, by definition, applied to large populations (tens of thousands to millions of individuals). In such large samples, random events have a minimal impact on overall allele frequencies, making this assumption highly robust.\n\n5.  **No Gene Flow (Migration):** This assumes the population is closed, with no introduction of alleles from other populations that may have different allele frequencies. Modern human populations are rarely completely isolated. However, for HWE calculations, the \"population\" is often a defined demographic or ancestral group for which the allele frequency $q$ has been empirically measured. If the screening program targets a relatively homogeneous population, or if migration rates are low, or if allele frequencies in migrant groups are similar, this assumption can serve as a reasonable approximation. In highly admixed populations, stratifying risk calculations by ancestry may be necessary to account for violations of this assumption.\n\nIn summary, by assuming random union of gametes within a population meeting the conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the probability of an individual having the genotype $aa$ is $q^2$. Given autosomal recessive inheritance and complete penetrance, this is also the probability of being affected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{q^2}$$", "id": "4456426"}, {"introduction": "Building on population-level frequencies, this exercise explores how non-random mating patterns alter genetic risk.

For the offspring to have the genotype $aa$, this single ancestral allele must have been $a$. The probability of drawing an allele $a$ from the gene pool is its frequency, $q$.
