Since different alkylating agents impact ovarian reserve with varying severity, clinicians need a standardized method to quantify and compare their cumulative effect.

To quantify cumulative ovarian gonadotoxic exposure from alkylating chemotherapy, the team uses the Cyclophosphamide Equivalent Dose (CED), defined as the total dose of each alkylating agent scaled by its relative gonadotoxic potency compared to cyclophosphamide and then summed across agents. Assume the following foundational principles are valid and widely accepted in the oncofertility literature: (1) for alkylating agents, the ovarian gonadotoxic effect is approximately proportional to administered body surface area–normalized dose, (2) when multiple alkylating agents are administered, their gonadotoxic effects are additive, and (3) each agent has a constant relative potency factor $f_i$ with cyclophosphamide serving as the reference ($f_{\\text{cyclophosphamide}}=1$), derived from empirical comparative toxicity studies.\n\nStarting from these principles, derive a closed-form expression for the Cyclophosphamide Equivalent Dose as a function of per-agent doses and relative potency factors. Then compute the CED for a chemotherapy regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide at $4{,}000\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$ with $f=1$ and ifosfamide at $6{,}000\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$ with $f=0.244$.

The validation of the problem statement confirms its scientific grounding, consistency, and well-posed nature. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins with formalizing the provided principles. Let $E$ denote the ovarian gonadotoxic effect. Let $D_i$ be the body surface area–normalized dose of the $i$-th alkylating agent, and $f_i$ be its relative gonadotoxic potency factor with respect to cyclophosphamide.\n\nPrinciple 1 states that the gonadotoxic effect of an agent is proportional to its dose. For the $i$-th agent, this can be written as:\n$$E_i = k_i D_i$$\nwhere $k_i$ is a constant of proportionality representing the intrinsic gonadotoxicity per unit dose of agent $i$.\n\nPrinciple 3 establishes a relationship between the potencies of different agents using the relative potency factor, $f_i$. Cyclophosphamide is the reference agent, which we denote with the subscript `c`. The relative potency $f_i$ is the ratio of the intrinsic gonadotoxicity of agent $i$ to that of cyclophosphamide:\n$$f_i = \\frac{k_i}{k_{\\text{c}}}$$\nBy definition, for cyclophosphamide itself, $f_{\\text{c}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{c}}}{k_{\\text{c}}} = 1$. This aligns with the value provided in the problem. From this relationship, we can express the intrinsic toxicity constant $k_i$ for any agent in terms of the reference constant $k_{\\text{c}}$:\n$$k_i = f_i k_{\\text{c}}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $E_i$, we obtain the effect of agent $i$ in terms of the reference potency:\n$$E_i = (f_i k_{\\text{c}}) D_i = k_{\\text{c}} (f_i D_i)$$\n\nPrinciple 2 states that the total gonadotoxic effect, $E_{\\text{total}}$, from a regimen of multiple alkylating agents is the sum of their individual effects:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_i E_i$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_i$ from the previous step yields:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_i k_{\\text{c}} (f_i D_i)$$\nSince $k_{\\text{c}}$ is a constant common to all terms in the sum, it can be factored out:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = k_{\\text{c}} \\sum_i (f_i D_i)$$\n\nThe Cyclophosphamide Equivalent Dose (CED) is defined as the dose of cyclophosphamide that, if administered alone, would produce the same total gonadotoxic effect, $E_{\\text{total}}$. Let us denote this dose as $\\text{CED}$. The effect of this dose of cyclophosphamide is:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = k_{\\text{c}} \\cdot \\text{CED}$$\nHere we have used the general effect equation $E = kD$ specifically for cyclophosphamide, where $k=k_{\\text{c}}$ and $D=\\text{CED}$.\n\nTo find the expression for CED, we equate the two derived expressions for $E_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$k_{\\text{c}} \\cdot \\text{CED} = k_{\\text{c}} \\sum_i (f_i D_i)$$\nThe constant $k_{\\text{c}}$ represents the intrinsic toxicity of cyclophosphamide and is non-zero. Therefore, we can divide both sides by $k_{\\text{c}}$ to obtain the closed-form expression for the Cyclophosphamide Equivalent Dose:\n$$\\text{CED} = \\sum_i f_i D_i$$\nThis expression formalizes the definition provided in the problem statement: the CED is the sum of each agent's dose scaled by its relative potency factor.\n\nNext, we apply this formula to compute the CED for the given regimen, which consists of two agents: cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. Let cyclophosphamide be agent $1$ and ifosfamide be agent $2$. The given data are:\n- Cyclophosphamide: $D_1 = 4{,}000\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$, $f_1 = 1$\n- Ifosfamide: $D_2 = 6{,}000\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$, $f_2 = 0.244$\n\nUsing the derived formula for these two agents ($i=1, 2$):\n$$\\text{CED} = f_1 D_1 + f_2 D_2$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\\text{CED} = (1 \\cdot 4{,}000) + (0.244 \\cdot 6{,}000)$$\nPerforming the multiplication for each term:\n$$1 \\cdot 4{,}000 = 4{,}000$$\n$$0.244 \\cdot 6{,}000 = 1464$$\nSumming the terms to find the total CED:\n$$\\text{CED} = 4{,}000 + 1464 = 5464$$\nThe resulting Cyclophosphamide Equivalent Dose has units of $\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$, consistent with the units of the individual doses.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5464}$$", "id": "4478553"}, {"introduction": "Quantifying gonadotoxic exposure is the first step; the next is to translate that into a personalized risk prediction for the patient.
