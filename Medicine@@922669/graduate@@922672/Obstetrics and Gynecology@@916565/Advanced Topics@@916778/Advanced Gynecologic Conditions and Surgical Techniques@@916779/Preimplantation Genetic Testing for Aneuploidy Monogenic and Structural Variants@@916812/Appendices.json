Since the cells are sampled independently from a population large enough to justify this assumption, $X$ follows a binomial distribution, denoted as $X \\sim B(n, p)$.

In PGT-A and PGT-SR, a trophectoderm biopsy result is typically classified based on the inferred percentage of abnormal cells in the sample. Common categories are euploid (normal), mosaic (a mix of normal and abnormal cells), and aneuploid (abnormal). While specific thresholds vary between laboratories, a widely accepted convention is:\n- **Euploid**: A very low percentage of abnormal cells, typically corresponding to $0$ abnormal cells ($0\\%$) or sometimes $1$ out of $5$ cells ($20\\%$) in the biopsy.\n- **Mosaic**: An intermediate percentage of abnormal cells, often in the range of $20\\%$ to $80\\%$. In a $5$-cell biopsy, this would correspond to detecting $2$ cells ($40\\%$) or $3$ cells ($60\\%$).\n- **Aneuploid**: A high percentage of abnormal cells, typically above $80\\%$, corresponding to $4$ ($80\\%$) or $5$ ($100\\%$) abnormal cells.\n\nThe event of observing \"at least $2$ abnormal cells\" encompasses the outcomes $X=2$, $X=3$, $X=4$, and $X=5$.\n- If the biopsy finds $2$ or $3$ abnormal cells (observed aneuploidy of $40\\%$ or $60\\%$), the result would fall squarely into the **mosaic** category by most laboratory standards.\n- If the biopsy finds $4$ or $5$ abnormal cells (observed aneuploidy of $80\\%$ or $100\\%$), the result would be classified as **aneuploid**.\n\nTherefore, the event of observing at least $2$ abnormal cells in the biopsy would lead to the embryo being classified as either mosaic or aneuploid, and not as euploid. The calculated probability of $0.4718$ represents the likelihood that this embryo, with a true trophectoderm mosaicism level of $30\\%$, would receive a non-euploid (mosaic or aneuploid) diagnosis, a result that would likely preclude its transfer in many clinical settings.
