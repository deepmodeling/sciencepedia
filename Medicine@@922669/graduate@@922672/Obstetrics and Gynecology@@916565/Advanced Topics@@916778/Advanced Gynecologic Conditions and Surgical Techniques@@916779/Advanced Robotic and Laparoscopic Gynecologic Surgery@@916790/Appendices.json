It is based on fundamental principles of optics, including Fraunhofer diffraction, the theory of the Airy pattern, and the Rayleigh resolution criterion. All terms are clearly defined, and sufficient information is provided to derive the requested expression and compute the numerical result. The parameters given are physically realistic. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins with the Rayleigh criterion applied to the image formed by the system. The system's circular aperture of diameter $D$ produces an Airy pattern as the point-spread function for a point source. The intensity distribution of this pattern is a function of the angle $\\phi$ from the optical axis. The first minimum of the Airy pattern occurs at an angle $\\alpha_{\\text{res}}$ where the argument of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, $J_1$, is equal to its first zero. The problem provides this value as $x_1 \\approx 3.8317$.\n\nThe argument of the Bessel function for a circular aperture is $k a \\sin\\phi$, where $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$ is the wavenumber, $a = D/2$ is the radius of the aperture, and $\\phi$ is the angle from the optical axis. At the first minimum, $\\phi = \\alpha_{\\text{res}}$, and we have:\n$$k a \\sin(\\alpha_{\\text{res}}) = x_1$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $k$ and $a$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right) \\left(\\frac{D}{2}\\right) \\sin(\\alpha_{\\text{res}}) = x_1$$\n$$\\frac{\\pi D}{\\lambda} \\sin(\\alpha_{\\text{res}}) = x_1$$\nThis gives the angular radius of the first dark ring of the Airy pattern in the image space:\n$$\\sin(\\alpha_{\\text{res}}) = \\frac{x_1 \\lambda}{\\pi D}$$\n\nThe Rayleigh criterion states that two point sources are just resolved if their images are separated by a distance equal to the radius of the Airy disk. Let this minimum resolvable distance in the image plane be $d'$. If the image is formed at a distance $v$ from the exit pupil of the system, this spatial separation is related to the angular separation by $d' = v \\tan(\\alpha_{\\text{res}})$. For small angles, which is an excellent approximation in most optical systems (paraxial approximation), we have $\\tan(\\alpha_{\\text{res}}) \\approx \\sin(\\alpha_{\\text{res}})$.\n$$d' \\approx v \\sin(\\alpha_{\\text{res}}) = v \\frac{x_1 \\lambda}{\\pi D}$$\nThis distance $d'$ in the image plane corresponds to the sought-after resolution limit $d$ in the object plane. The relationship between them is the lateral magnification of the system, $M$:\n$$d' = M d$$\nTherefore, the object-plane resolution is:\n$$d = \\frac{d'}{M} = \\frac{1}{M} \\left(v \\frac{x_1 \\lambda}{\\pi D}\\right)$$\nFor an imaging system described by the thin lens approximation, the magnification is given by $M = v/u$, where $u$ is the object distance. Substituting this into the expression for $d$:\n$$d = \\frac{u}{v} \\left(v \\frac{x_1 \\lambda}{\\pi D}\\right) = \\frac{x_1 \\lambda u}{\\pi D}$$\nThis expression contains the terms $u$ and $D$, which must be related to the given numerical aperture, $\\mathrm{NA}$. The problem defines $\\mathrm{NA}$ in the object space as $\\mathrm{NA} = n \\sin\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the half-angle of the cone of light collected by the objective from a point on the object. In this problem, the medium is air, so $n=1$, and $\\mathrm{NA} = \\sin\\theta$.\n\nFrom the geometry in the object space, the half-angle $\\theta$ is related to the object distance $u$ and the aperture diameter $D$ by $\\tan\\theta = (D/2)/u = D/(2u)$. Using the paraxial approximation again, $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\tan\\theta$. Therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{NA} = \\sin\\theta \\approx \\frac{D}{2u}$$\nThis approximation is valid for small $\\mathrm{NA}$ and is the standard approach for this derivation. The fact that the system is aplanatic ensures this result holds with greater generality than suggested by the paraxial approximation. From this relation, we can express the ratio $u/D$ in terms of $\\mathrm{NA}$:\n$$\\frac{u}{D} \\approx \\frac{1}{2 \\mathrm{NA}}$$\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $d$:\n$$d \\approx \\left(\\frac{x_1 \\lambda}{\\pi}\\right) \\left(\\frac{u}{D}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{x_1 \\lambda}{\\pi}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2 \\mathrm{NA}}\\right)$$\n$$d = \\frac{x_1}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mathrm{NA}}$$\nThis is the derived closed-form expression for the lateral resolution limit $d$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given values: $\\lambda = 550\\,\\text{nm} = 550 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}$, $\\mathrm{NA} = 0.12$, and $x_1 \\approx 3.8317$.\n$$d \\approx \\frac{3.8317}{2\\pi} \\frac{550 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}}{0.12}$$\nFirst, we calculate the coefficient:\n$$\\frac{3.8317}{2\\pi} \\approx 0.60983$$\nSo, the formula is the well-known $d \\approx 0.61 \\lambda / \\mathrm{NA}$.\n$$d \\approx 0.60983 \\times \\frac{550 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}}{0.12}$$\n$$d \\approx 0.60983 \\times (4583.33... \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m})$$\n$$d \\approx 2.79506 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}$$\nThe problem asks for the result in micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$), where $1\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}$.\n$$d \\approx 2.79506\\,\\mu\\text{m}$$\nFinally, rounding the result to three significant figures:\n$$d \\approx 2.80\\,\\mu\\text{m}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.80}$$", "id": "4400629"}, {"introduction": "The precise application of energy is central to minimally invasive surgery, but the heat generated by devices like electrocautery can spread to adjacent structures, such as the ureter, posing a significant risk of injury.
