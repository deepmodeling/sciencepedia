Female Genital Cosmetic Surgery (FGCS) is defined as elective surgical modification of genital anatomy in the absence of malignancy, infection, or life-threatening pathology. The clinic applies the four-principle framework of biomedical ethics—beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice—and a proportionality standard that distinguishes therapeutic (functional) from non-therapeutic (purely aesthetic) indications. The surgical technique under consideration is a single-stage wedge labiaplasty performed under local anesthesia. From audited outcomes in the clinic’s registry, the following probabilities and disutilities for complications are estimated for this technique: minor wound complication probability $p_{m} = 0.07$ with disutility $d_{m} = 0.80$, major complication probability $p_{M} = 0.01$ with disutility $d_{M} = 4.00$, altered sensation probability $p_{\\text{sens}} = 0.06$ with disutility $d_{\\text{sens}} = 2.00$, and need for revision probability $p_{r} = 0.05$ with disutility $d_{r} = 1.20$. Assume, for purposes of ethical decision analysis, that these events are approximately independent in expectation and that disutilities are additive for the purpose of calculating expected net utility.\n\nPatient $\\mathcal{F}$ is age $28$, reports labial hypertrophy causing chafing, hygiene difficulties, and dyspareunia despite conservative measures. A functional examination confirms mechanical irritation without infection. On the clinic’s validated informed-consent comprehension instrument, she scores $C_{\\mathcal{F}} = 0.90$ (threshold for adequate comprehension $C \\ge 0.80$). Based on prior outcomes for patients with similar functional complaints, the probability of clinically meaningful functional improvement is $p^{\\mathcal{F}}_{s} = 0.85$, with an estimated benefit magnitude $U^{\\mathcal{F}}_{B} = 1.60$ utility units reflecting pain relief and improved function.\n\nPatient $\\mathcal{A}$ is age $24$, has no functional complaints, and seeks surgery for perceived asymmetry and aesthetic dissatisfaction. She scores $C_{\\mathcal{A}} = 0.85$ on the same instrument. Psychosocial assessment indicates a probability of unrealistic expectations $p_{\\text{unreal}} = 0.40$. For patients with purely aesthetic motivations, the clinic’s outcomes indicate a probability of subjective satisfaction $p^{\\mathcal{A}}_{s} = 0.70$, with benefit magnitude if expectations are realistic $U^{\\mathcal{A}}_{B} = 1.20$ utility units; if expectations are unrealistic, realized benefit is approximately a fraction $f_{\\text{unreal}} = 0.30$ of the realistic benefit. To honor proportionality and nonmaleficence, the clinic requires that the expected net utility for non-therapeutic indications exceed a stricter threshold $\\Delta = 0.50$ units, whereas for therapeutic indications the threshold is $\\Delta = 0.00$ units.\n\nUsing the four-principle framework and expected utility as a well-tested decision-theoretic base, evaluate the ethical justifiability of proceeding with wedge labiaplasty for Patients $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{A}$. Which recommendation best aligns with beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and proportionality given the data?\n\nA. Proceed with surgery for both Patient $\\mathcal{F}$ and Patient $\\mathcal{A}$ because autonomy is satisfied and both have positive expected net utility.\n\nB. Offer surgery to Patient $\\mathcal{F}$ now, but defer surgery for Patient $\\mathcal{A}$ pending further psychological evaluation and a cooling-off period, because Patient $\\mathcal{F}$ meets the therapeutic threshold while Patient $\\mathcal{A}$ does not meet the stricter non-therapeutic threshold.\n\nC.

Analysis: For Patient $\\mathcal{F}$, $E[U_{\\text{net}}]_{\\mathcal{F}} = 1.084 > 0$, benefits outweigh risks, and therapeutic threshold is met. This option disregards beneficence for the functional case. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Proceed with surgery for Patient $\\mathcal{A}$ only because psychosocial benefits are ethically prioritized over functional gains when autonomy is intact. Analysis: Psychosocial benefits are important, but proportionality requires $E[U_{\\text{net}}]_{\\mathcal{A}} \\ge 0.50$ for non-therapeutic cases, which is not met. Additionally, privileging non-therapeutic over therapeutic indications contradicts beneficence and proportionality given $E[U_{\\text{net}}]_{\\mathcal{F}}$ is robustly positive.

She requests labiaplasty. You are tasked with designing a clinic-wide informed consent protocol specific to labiaplasty that upholds the core elements of informed consent (disclosure, understanding, capacity, and voluntariness) under the principles of respect for patient autonomy, nonmaleficence, and beneficence. Starting from these ethical principles and well-established surgical practice standards, select the protocol that most completely and accurately addresses the following domains without overpromising outcomes: reasonable alternatives, likely benefits, specific material risks, postoperative restrictions, and the possibility of needing revision. Each option below is intended as the exact script the clinic would use.\n\nWhich option best meets the ethical and technical requirements for a comprehensive informed consent protocol in this scenario?\n\nA. Alternatives: Offer no surgery; clothing and activity modification; nonirritating fabrics and emollients; management of vulvar dermatoses if present; shared decision-making to defer surgery until after planned childbirth if the patient prefers; psychological support for body image concerns and screening for body dysmorphic disorder. Likely benefits: Reduction in mechanical irritation and chafing, improved comfort with activities and clothing, potential improvement in hygiene challenges; aesthetic improvement is possible, but symmetry and sexual function enhancement cannot be guaranteed. Specific risks: Bleeding, hematoma, infection, wound dehiscence, delayed healing, scarring or contracture, asymmetry, notching, overresection with insufficient labial edge, altered sensation (hypoesthesia, paresthesia, or, rarely, hyperalgesia), dyspareunia, chronic vestibular pain, need for staged correction if edges are compromised, and anesthesia-related risks; acknowledge that published minor complication rates are low but not zero, and that reoperation or revision is sometimes required (approximately $3$ to $8\\%$ depending on technique and definitions). Postoperative restrictions: Pelvic rest with no penetrative intercourse or tampon use for $4$ to $6$ weeks; avoid strenuous exercise and activities causing perineal friction for $2$ to $4$ weeks; meticulous perineal hygiene, use of cold compresses and sitz baths as directed, and smoking cessation to reduce wound complications. Possible need for revision: Results can evolve with scar maturation and future childbirth, and secondary revision may be needed to address symptomatic scar, notching, or asymmetry; no guarantee of specific cosmetic outcome. Additional elements: Explicit discussion of photography with written permission; privacy safeguards; cost and typical lack of insurance coverage; avoidance of coercion; the option to withdraw consent at any time before surgery.\n\nB. Alternatives: None are advisable given that labiaplasty is a simple corrective procedure; surgery is recommended as first-line. Likely benefits: Reliable improvement in sexual arousal and orgasm, perfect symmetry, and permanent aesthetic normalization. Specific risks: Essentially negligible (less than $0.1\\%$); nerve-related issues do not occur with modern techniques. Postoperative restrictions: Return to full activity, including penetrative intercourse and tampon use, within $48$ hours is acceptable. Possible need for revision: Almost never required (less than $0.5\\%$), thus not necessary to discuss to avoid creating anxiety.\n\nC. Alternatives: Watchful waiting and clothing modification are briefly mentioned, but emphasis is placed on proceeding to surgery for durable results. Likely benefits: High likelihood of improved sexual satisfaction and self-esteem; functional improvement is assumed if the labia are reduced. Specific risks: Bleeding, infection, and asymmetry are mentioned; altered sensation is described as temporary and self-limited in all cases; overresection is not discussed. Postoperative restrictions: Avoid high-intensity exercise for $7$ days; sexual activity may resume as tolerated after $10$ to $14$ days. Possible need for revision: Not typically addressed because it may bias expectations.\n\nD. Alternatives: Defer to surgeon preference; the decision is primarily technical. Likely benefits: Correction of visible protrusion with standard cosmetic results typical of before-and-after photographs; additional benefits are at the surgeon’s discretion and need not be specifically stated. Specific risks: A generic surgical consent listing infection and bleeding is sufficient; nerve or sexual function issues do not need to be discussed because they are rare. Postoperative restrictions: Standard wound care; no explicit activity restrictions are needed beyond patient comfort. Possible need for revision: Not discussed; surgeons will advise if needed later.

I must first validate the problem statement and then, if valid, derive the correct answer by analyzing the provided options against established ethical and medical principles.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n-   **Patient:** A $28$-year-old, nulliparous female.\n-   **Clinical Presentation:** Chronic irritation from activities (cycling, yoga), occasional superficial fissuring at the posterior labia minora, and psychological distress from labial protrusion in clothing.\n-   **Patient Request:** Labiaplasty.\n-   **Task:** Design a clinic-wide informed consent protocol for labiaplasty.\n-   **Guiding Principles:**\n    1.  **Core elements of informed consent:** Disclosure, understanding, capacity, and voluntariness.\n    2.  **Ethical principles:** Respect for patient autonomy, nonmaleficence, and beneficence.\n-   **Required Protocol Domains:**\n    1.  Reasonable alternatives.\n    2.  Likely benefits.\n    3.  Specific material risks.\n    4.  Postoperative restrictions.\n    5.  Possibility of needing revision.\n-   **Constraint:** The protocol must not overpromise outcomes.\n-   **Question:** Select the option that most completely and accurately meets these requirements.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in the medical field of gynecology and plastic surgery, specifically addressing female genital cosmetic surgery (FGCS). The patient's symptoms are common indications for labiaplasty. The ethical framework (autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence) and the components of informed consent are fundamental to all medical practice and are codified in medical ethics and law. The problem is scientifically and ethically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It establishes clear criteria (ethical principles, required domains) against which the provided options are to be judged. The objective is to identify the \"best\" and \"most complete\" option, which implies a comparative analysis leading to a single optimal choice from the given set.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, clinical language. The patient's situation is presented as a case vignette, and the task is to apply established, objective standards of medical ethics and surgical practice.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a realistic, well-defined problem in medical ethics and practice that does not violate any of the specified validation criteria. I will now proceed with the solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nAn ethically and medically sound informed consent protocol for labiaplasty, as per the problem description, must be built upon the principles of autonomy, nonmaleficence, and beneficence.\n\n1.  **Respect for Patient Autonomy:** The patient must be empowered to make an uncoerced, informed choice. This requires a complete and unbiased disclosure of all relevant information. Crucially, this includes a thorough discussion of all viable alternatives to surgery, including the option of no treatment. For this specific patient (nulliparous, concerns about appearance), this must include discussion of psychological support (e.g., screening for Body Dysmorphic Disorder, BDD) and the potential impact of future childbirth on labial anatomy, making deferral of surgery a key option.\n\n2.  **Nonmaleficence (Do No Harm):** The protocol must prioritize patient safety by providing a frank and comprehensive discussion of potential negative outcomes. This includes not only common and minor complications but also rare but severe ones. Understating risks or providing false assurances is a direct violation of this principle. The protocol must list general surgical risks (bleeding, infection) and procedure-specific risks like scarring, asymmetry, overresection, permanent sensory changes, chronic pain (including dyspareunia), and the need for revision surgery. Quoting evidence-based complication and revision rates adds to transparency.\n\n3.  **Beneficence (Act in the Patient's Best Interest):** The protocol must set realistic expectations about the potential benefits. Benefits should be linked to the patient's specific complaints (e.g., reduction in mechanical irritation). Promises of enhanced sexual function or \"perfect\" aesthetics are not supported by robust evidence and are therefore unethical. Beneficence also involves ensuring the patient is an appropriate candidate for surgery and that the potential benefits outweigh the risks for that individual.\n\nBased on these principles, a model protocol must address the five specified domains as follows:\n-   **Alternatives:** Must include \"no surgery,\" conservative measures (e.g., clothing, lubricants), management of any underlying skin conditions, psychological counseling, and deferral of surgery.\n-   **Benefits:** Must be stated cautiously. Functional improvements are more predictable than aesthetic or sexual ones. Guarantees of symmetry, specific appearance, or improved sexual function must be explicitly denied.\n-   **Risks:** Must be comprehensive, specific, and include both common and rare/serious complications (e.g., overresection, chronic pain, sensory loss, need for revision).\n-   **Postoperative Restrictions:** Must be specific, clear, and consistent with standard surgical practice to ensure proper healing (e.g., pelvic rest for $4-6$ weeks).\n-   **Revision:** The possibility and approximate rate of revision surgery must be clearly stated.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The protocol in Option A**\n\n-   **Alternatives:** This option provides a comprehensive list: no surgery, conservative management, dermatological treatment, deferral until after childbirth, and psychological screening/support. This fully respects patient autonomy.\n-   **Likely Benefits:** The description is appropriately cautious. It promises potential reduction in functional symptoms while explicitly stating that aesthetic improvement is only possible and that symmetry and sexual function enhancement *cannot be guaranteed*. This is ethically sound.\n-   **Specific Risks:** The list of risks is exhaustive and accurate. It includes general risks as well as specific, serious risks like overresection, altered sensation, dyspareunia, and chronic pain. It provides a realistic, evidence-based revision rate (approximately $3$ to $8\\%$). This meets the principle of nonmaleficence.\n-   **Postoperative Restrictions:** The instructions are specific and medically appropriate ($4$ to $6$ weeks of pelvic rest, $2$ to $4$ weeks of activity restriction, hygiene details). This promotes patient safety.\n-   **Possible Need for Revision:** This is clearly discussed, including the role of scar maturation and future life events.\n-   **Additional Elements:** The inclusion of consent for photography, privacy, cost, and the right to withdraw consent makes this a gold-standard protocol.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**. This protocol is comprehensive, medically accurate, and ethically robust. It perfectly aligns with the principles and requirements outlined in the problem.\n\n**B. The protocol in Option B**\n\n-   **Alternatives:** Claims \"None are advisable\". This is coercive and violates patient autonomy.\n-   **Likely Benefits:** Promises \"reliable improvement in sexual arousal and orgasm, perfect symmetry, and permanent aesthetic normalization.\" These are unsubstantiated, unrealistic, and unethical guarantees.\n-   **Specific Risks:** Falsely claims risks are \"essentially negligible (less than $0.1\\%$)\" and that nerve issues \"do not occur\". This is a dangerous misrepresentation that violates the core tenets of informed consent and nonmaleficence.\n-   **Postoperative Restrictions:** Advises return to full activity, including intercourse, within $48$ hours. This is medically contraindicated and would likely lead to severe complications.\n-   **Possible Need for Revision:** Avoids discussion of revision, which is unethical and dishonest.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This protocol is a dangerous departure from medical and ethical standards. It is filled with factual falsehoods and unethical promises.\n\n**C. The protocol in Option C**\n\n-   **Alternatives:** Alternatives are \"briefly mentioned,\" indicating a biased presentation that undermines shared decision-making.\n-   **Likely Benefits:** Promises a \"high likelihood of improved sexual satisfaction,\" which is an overstatement and not guaranteed.\n-   **Specific Risks:** The list is incomplete, omitting major risks like overresection and permanent sensory change. Stating that altered sensation is \"temporary... in all cases\" is factually incorrect.\n-   **Postoperative Restrictions:** The recommended timeframes ($7$ days for exercise, $10$ to $14$ days for sexual activity) are too short and unsafe.\n-   **Possible Need for Revision:** The topic is avoided, which is a failure of disclosure.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This protocol is incomplete, biased, and provides medically unsound advice.\n\n**D. The protocol in Option D**\n\n-   **Alternatives:** States the decision is a \"primarily technical\" one for the surgeon. This dismisses patient autonomy entirely in favor of medical paternalism.\n-   **Likely Benefits:** Vague and non-committal. Stating that benefits are at the \"surgeon's discretion and need not be specifically stated\" is the antithesis of informed consent.\n-   **Specific Risks:** Recommends a \"generic surgical consent,\" which is legally and ethically inadequate for a specific procedure with unique risks. Omitting nerve and sexual function risks is a major failure of disclosure.\n-   **Postoperative Restrictions:** The advice is vague (\"Standard wound care,\" \"beyond patient comfort\"), which is unhelpful and unsafe.\n-   **Possible Need for Revision:** This is not discussed, another failure of disclosure. The suggestion that this protocol is acceptable for minors is a particularly egregious ethical error.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This protocol represents a complete failure to adhere to the principles of modern informed consent.\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A is the only choice that represents a complete, accurate, and ethically sound informed consent protocol that meets all the criteria specified in the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4436398"}, {"introduction": "Translating ethical and procedural decisions into successful surgical outcomes requires technical mastery and a deep understanding of tissue biology.

This structure is logical, self-contained, and free of contradictions. The scenario is clinically realistic and does not violate any fundamental principles of biology, chemistry, or physics. The language is objective and precise.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is declared **valid**. It is a well-posed, scientifically sound problem that requires the application of established principles of surgery and material science. Proceeding to solution derivation.\n\n**Derivation of the Optimal Solution**\n\nThe problem requires a two-layer closure. Each layer is analyzed separately based on the given constraints.\n\n**1. Vulvar Mucosa Closure Analysis**\n- **Primary Challenges:** Friable tissue and the need for hemostasis from multiple pinpoint bleeders.\n- **Hemostasis Requirement:** The presence of multiple ($>5$) bleeding sites necessitates a hemostatic suture technique. A simple running or interrupted stitch provides edge approximation but is suboptimal for controlling diffuse bleeding. A running locking suture is highly hemostatic but poses a significant risk of tissue strangulation and necrosis, which must be avoided in \"friable\" tissue. A figure-of-eight stitch is specifically designed to provide hemostasis by compressing the tissue and underlying vessels at a specific point. An interrupted series of figure-of-eight sutures would effectively address the multiple bleeding sites while minimizing the risk of ischemic compromise to the entire suture line.\n- **Material Tensile Strength Requirement:** The suture must maintain adequate tensile strength for approximately $14$ days to support the wound through the inflammatory ($0$-$4$ days) and early proliferative ($4$-$21$ days) phases.\n    - **Fast-absorbing gut:** Loses significant strength in $5$-$7$ days. Inadequate.\n    - **Poliglecaprone 25 (PG25):** Retains approximately $50$-$60$% of its strength at $7$ days and only $20$-$30$% at $14$ days. This rapid loss of strength presents a risk of premature wound separation.\n    - **Polyglactin 910 (PG910):** A braided copolymer that retains approximately $75$% of its tensile strength at $14$ days and $50$% at $21$ days. This profile is well-suited for the required duration.\n    - **Polydioxanone (PDO):** A monofilament with a very long strength duration (retaining ~$70$% at $4$ weeks). This is excessive for the specified $14$-day requirement. Its increased stiffness can also lead to patient discomfort in a sensitive area.\n- **Material Caliber:** For mucosal closure with bleeding, a $3$-$0$ or $4$-$0$ suture is appropriate. A $3$-$0$ suture provides superior strength and needle control for achieving hemostasis in this context.\n- **Conclusion for Mucosa:** The optimal choice is a suture with a strength profile matching the $14$-day requirement and a pattern providing targeted hemostasis. This points toward **$3$-$0$ polyglactin $910$ (PG910) in a figure-of-eight interrupted pattern**.\n\n**2. Labial Skin (Cutaneous) Closure Analysis**\n- **Primary Challenges:** Achieving a superior cosmetic outcome (minimal scarring, no stitch marks) in a low-tension wound.\n- **Cosmesis Requirement:** The goal of \"minimal visible scarring\" and avoiding \"stitch marks\" definitively indicates the need for a **running subcuticular** (or intradermal) suture technique. This technique places the suture entirely within the dermis, avoiding the skin-surface puncture marks (\"railroad tracks\") characteristic of all percutaneous stitches (e.g., simple interrupted, vertical mattress). The \"low residual edge tension\" makes this technique feasible and ideal.\n- **Material Reactivity and Type:** For optimal cosmesis, a suture with the lowest possible tissue reactivity is required. Monofilament sutures are less reactive than braided sutures because their smooth surface does not harbor bacteria. The patient's preference for absorbable material must be honored.\n    - **Poliglecaprone 25 (PG25):** An absorbable monofilament with very low tissue reactivity and a smooth surface, facilitating easy passage through tissue. Its strength profile, while insufficient for the mucosa under tension, is adequate for a low-tension subcuticular skin closure where tension is borne by deeper layers.\n    - **Polyglactin 910 (PG910):** Braided, more reactive. Not the first choice for a cosmetic subcuticular closure.\n    - **Silk:** Natural, braided, highly reactive. Contraindicated for cosmetic skin closure. Non-absorbable.\n    - **Nylon:** Monofilament, low reactivity, but non-absorbable, violating a key patient preference.\n- **Material Caliber:** The \"smallest practical caliber\" for a cosmetic closure in this anatomical region is typically $5$-$0$ or $6$-$0$. A $5$-$0$ suture offers a good balance of strength and fine caliber.\n- **Conclusion for Skin:** The optimal choice is a fine-gauge, low-reactivity, absorbable monofilament placed in a subcuticular pattern. This points toward **$5$-$0$ poliglecaprone $25$ (PG25) in a running subcuticular continuous pattern**.\n\n**Synthesized Optimal Strategy:**\n- **Mucosa:** $3$-$0$ polyglactin $910$ (PG910), figure-of-eight interrupted.\n- **Skin:** $5$-$0$ poliglecaprone $25$ (PG25), running subcuticular continuous.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Mucosa: $3$-$0$ polyglactin 910 (PG910) simple interrupted; Skin: $5$-$0$ poliglecaprone 25 (PG25) running subcuticular continuous**\n    *   Mucosa: The material ($3$-$0$ PG910) is appropriate in terms of strength and absorption. The simple interrupted pattern provides approximation but is less hemostatic than a figure-of-eight for multiple bleeders. It is, however, a valid and safe technique.\n    *   Skin: The combination of $5$-$0$ PG25 and a running subcuticular pattern is ideal and perfectly matches the derived optimal strategy for the skin.\n    *   Verdict: This is a very strong and clinically sound option. **Incorrect**, but only because a more optimized choice exists.\n\n*   **B. Mucosa: $3$-$0$ fast-absorbing plain gut running continuous; Skin: $4$-$0$ nylon interrupted simple percutaneous**\n    *   Mucosa: Fast-absorbing plain gut fails the $14$-day strength requirement.\n    *   Skin: Nylon is non-absorbable, violating patient preference. An interrupted percutaneous technique fails the cosmetic requirement to avoid stitch marks.\n    *   Verdict: **Incorrect**. This option violates multiple primary constraints.\n\n*   **C. Mucosa: $4$-$0$ polydioxanone (PDO) running locking; Skin: $5$-$0$ silk interrupted vertical mattress percutaneous**\n    *   Mucosa: A running locking stitch on friable tissue is high-risk for strangulation. PDO is excessively long-lasting and stiff for this application.\n    *   Skin: Silk is highly reactive and a very poor choice for cosmetic closure. A vertical mattress stitch is for high-tension wounds and leaves significant marks.\n    *   Verdict: **Incorrect**. Both choices are actively detrimental to the stated goals.\n\n*   **D. Mucosa: $3$-$0$ poliglecaprone 25 (PG25) continuous submucosal; Skin: $5$-$0$ poliglecaprone 25 (PG25) interrupted simple percutaneous**\n    *   Mucosa: PG25 loses strength too rapidly for the $14$-day requirement. A submucosal stitch offers poor hemostasis for active bleeding.\n    *   Skin: An interrupted percutaneous technique fails the cosmetic requirement to avoid stitch marks.\n    *   Verdict: **Incorrect**. This option fails on critical requirements for both layers.\n\n*   **E. Mucosa: $3$-$0$ polyglactin 910 (PG910) figure-of-eight interrupted; Skin: $5$-$0$ poliglecaprone 25 (PG25) running subcuticular continuous**\n    *   Mucosa: This combines the appropriate material ($3$-$0$ PG910) for strength-duration with the optimal pattern (figure-of-eight) for addressing the specific problem of multiple pinpoint bleeders in friable tissue without causing widespread ischemia.\n    *   Skin: This is the ideal choice ($5$-$0$ PG25 running subcuticular) for a cosmetic, low-tension, absorbable closure.\n    *   Verdict: **Correct**. This option provides the most optimized solution for both the mucosal and cutaneous layers, precisely addressing all stated givens and constraints. It is superior to option A because the figure-of-eight stitch is better suited for the described bleeding than a simple interrupted stitch.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "4436406"}]}
