Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed with an assay validated for Combined Positive Score (CPS) reporting. In gynecologic oncology practice, CPS is a microenvironment-weighted measure of PD-L1 activity constructed from the core definition that it counts PD-L1 positive tumor cells together with PD-L1 positive lymphocytes and PD-L1 positive macrophages, normalized to the burden of viable tumor cells, and scaled by a factor of $100$ to provide a standardized score per $100$ viable tumor cells.\n\nA pathologist reviewed $5$ non-overlapping high-power fields from viable tumor regions (necrosis excluded) and recorded the following counts, where positivity indicates any membranous staining that is specific and above background, and each cell is counted once in its appropriate category within the tumor nests and immediately adjacent stroma:\n\n- Field $1$: total viable tumor cells $= 400$; PD-L1 positive tumor cells $= 60$; PD-L1 positive lymphocytes $= 15$; PD-L1 positive macrophages $= 0$.\n- Field $2$: total viable tumor cells $= 500$; PD-L1 positive tumor cells $= 50$; PD-L1 positive lymphocytes $= 20$; PD-L1 positive macrophages $= 5$.\n- Field $3$: total viable tumor cells $= 300$; PD-L1 positive tumor cells $= 45$; PD-L1 positive lymphocytes $= 0$; PD-L1 positive macrophages $= 0$.\n- Field $4$: total viable tumor cells $= 450$; PD-L1 positive tumor cells $= 80$; PD-L1 positive lymphocytes $= 15$; PD-L1 positive macrophages $= 0$.\n- Field $5$: total viable tumor cells $= 350$; PD-L1 positive tumor cells $= 10$; PD-L1 positive lymphocytes $= 0$; PD-L1 positive macrophages $= 0$.\n\nStarting from the above CPS definition, compute the CPS for this specimen as a single case-level value by summing across fields.

The context, use of PD-L1 CPS as a biomarker for checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., Pembrolizumab) in cervical cancer, and the cellular components of the score (tumor cells, lymphocytes, macrophages) are all factually correct and grounded in established principles of clinical oncology and tumor immunology.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a formal, albeit verbal, definition of the quantity to be calculated (CPS). All necessary numerical data are provided. The instruction to \"sum across fields\" provides an unambiguous method for aggregating the data to compute a single case-level score. The second part of the problem asks for an interpretation and rationale, which, while qualitative, is based on objective, verifiable clinical guidelines and scientific mechanisms, not subjective opinion.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. The data provided are sufficient for the calculation, and there are no contradictory statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a well-structured problem that combines a quantitative calculation with a qualitative explanation based on established scientific and clinical principles. The solution will proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires a two-part answer: first, the calculation of the Combined Positive Score (CPS) from the provided cell counts, and second, the clinical and mechanistic interpretation of the result.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Combined Positive Score (CPS)**\n\nThe definition provided states that CPS is the number of PD-L1 positive cells (tumor cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages) divided by the total number of viable tumor cells, with the result multiplied by $100$. For a case-level score derived from multiple fields, the counts are first summed across all fields.\n\nLet $N_{PTC}$ be the number of PD-L1 positive tumor cells, $N_{PLC}$ be the number of PD-L1 positive lymphocytes, and $N_{PMC}$ be the number of PD-L1 positive macrophages. Let $N_{VTC}$ be the total number of viable tumor cells. The calculation for the case-level CPS is given by the formula:\n$$\nCPS = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{5} N_{PTC,i} + \\sum_{i=1}^{5} N_{PLC,i} + \\sum_{i=1}^{5} N_{PMC,i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{5} N_{VTC,i}} \\times 100\n$$\nwhere $i$ is the index for each of the $5$ high-power fields.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of PD-L1 positive staining cells (the numerator of the fraction) by summing the counts across all fields:\nTotal PD-L1 positive tumor cells: $\\sum N_{PTC,i} = 60 + 50 + 45 + 80 + 10 = 245$.\nTotal PD-L1 positive lymphocytes: $\\sum N_{PLC,i} = 15 + 20 + 0 + 15 + 0 = 50$.\nTotal PD-L1 positive macrophages: $\\sum N_{PMC,i} = 0 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5$.\n\nThe total number of all PD-L1 positive cells is the sum of these three values:\n$$\n\\text{Total PD-L1 positive cells} = 245 + 50 + 5 = 300\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of viable tumor cells (the denominator of the fraction) by summing the counts across all fields:\n$$\n\\sum N_{VTC,i} = 400 + 500 + 300 + 450 + 350 = 2000\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute these sums into the CPS formula:\n$$\nCPS = \\frac{300}{2000} \\times 100\n$$\n$$\nCPS = 0.15 \\times 100\n$$\n$$\nCPS = 15\n$$\nThe calculated Combined Positive Score for this specimen is $15$.\n\n**Part 2: Interpretation and Rationale**\n\nThe problem asks for an interpretation of a CPS of $15$ in the context of treatment selection for cervical cancer and the mechanistic rationale for the CPS metric.\n\n**Clinical Interpretation**:\nIn the treatment of recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer, PD-L1 expression as measured by CPS is a predictive biomarker for response to the anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab. Regulatory approvals (e.g., by the U.S. FDA), based on landmark clinical trials such as KEYNOTE-158 and KEYNOTE-826, have established a CPS of $\\geq 1$ as the threshold for defining PD-L1 positivity.\n- A CPS of $\\geq 1$ indicates that a patient is eligible for pembrolizumab, either as monotherapy in the second-line setting (after progression on chemotherapy) or in combination with chemotherapy (with or without bevacizumab) in the first-line setting.\n- The calculated CPS for this patient is $15$. Since $15 \\geq 1$, this patient's tumor is considered PD-L1 positive.\n- Therefore, a CPS of $15$ indicates that the patient is a candidate for checkpoint inhibitor therapy with pembrolizumab and is predicted to have a greater likelihood of response compared to a patient with a CPS $< 1$.\n\n**Mechanistic Rationale**:\nThe rationale for including both tumor and immune cells in the CPS metric is rooted in the fundamental biology of the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint axis.\n1.  **The PD-1/PD-L1 Axis**: Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an inhibitory co-receptor expressed on the surface of activated T-cells, B-cells, and myeloid cells. Its ligand, Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1), can be expressed by cancer cells as well as by various non-malignant cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME), including antigen-presenting cells like macrophages and dendritic cells, and even other lymphocytes.\n2.  **Mechanism of Immune Evasion**: When PD-L1 on any cell in the TME binds to PD-1 on an effector T-cell, it transduces an inhibitory signal that suppresses T-cell proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxic activity. This process, known as T-cell exhaustion, is a primary mechanism by which tumors evade destruction by the host immune system.\n3.  **Rationale for CPS**: The therapeutic goal of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies is to block this inhibitory interaction, thereby restoring the anti-tumor activity of T-cells. The inhibitory signal can originate from PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells (direct protection) or from PD-L1 expressed on immune cells like macrophages and lymphocytes within the TME (indirect, environmental immunosuppression). A scoring system that only measures PD-L1 on tumor cells (such as the Tumor Proportion Score, or TPS) would fail to capture the immunosuppressive contribution of the surrounding stroma and immune infiltrate. The Combined Positive Score (CPS) provides a more comprehensive assessment of the total PD-L1-mediated inhibitory burden within the tumor-immune interface. It quantifies the density of the targetable PD-1/PD-L1 interactions, regardless of whether PD-L1 is on a tumor cell or an immune cell. A higher CPS suggests a TME that is already \"inflamed\" (i.e., contains an immune infiltrate) but is being actively suppressed via the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, making it an ideal environment to be 'unleashed' by checkpoint blockade.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{15}\n$$", "id": "4453229"}, {"introduction": "Assessing tumor response to immunotherapy presents unique challenges, as phenomena like pseudoprogression can mimic disease advancement.

The core of the problem lies in the correct application of immune Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (iRECIST) definitions, which requires translating the provided bidimensional tumor measurements into the unidimensional sum of longest diameters (SLD) format used by iRECIST.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Principles and Derivations\n\nThe problem requires a conversion from a percentage change in a bidimensional product to a percentage change in a unidimensional sum. Let us model the target lesions. For a single lesion, let its perpendicular diameters at baseline be $d_{1,B}$ and $d_{2,B}$. The bidimensional product is $P_B = d_1 \\cdot d_2$. The lesion's contribution to the SLD is its longest diameter, say $d_{1,B}$. The total SLD is the sum over all $N$ target lesions, $\\text{SLD}_B = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} d_{1,B}^{(i)}$. The total bidimensional product is $P_{TOT,B} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (d_{1,B}^{(i)} \\cdot d_{2,B}^{(i)})$.\n\nThe problem states to \"assume that the reported bidimensional percentage changes reflect approximately proportional changes in linear dimensions under similar geometry across time points.\" This critical assumption implies that if a linear dimension changes by a scaling factor $k$, all other linear dimensions of the lesions also change by the same factor $k$. This homothety applies to all target lesions.\n\nAt a follow-up time point, the new diameters are $d_{1,C} = k \\cdot d_{1,B}$ and $d_{2,C} = k \\cdot d_{2,B}$ for each lesion.\nThe new SLD is:\n$$ \\text{SLD}_C = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} d_{1,C}^{(i)} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} k \\cdot d_{1,B}^{(i)} = k \\cdot \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} d_{1,B}^{(i)}\\right) = k \\cdot \\text{SLD}_B $$\nThe new total bidimensional product is:\n$$ P_{TOT,C} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (d_{1,C}^{(i)} \\cdot d_{2,C}^{(i)}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (k \\cdot d_{1,B}^{(i)} \\cdot k \\cdot d_{2,B}^{(i)}) = k^2 \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} d_{1,B}^{(i)} \\cdot d_{2,B}^{(i)}\\right) = k^2 \\cdot P_{TOT,B} $$\nFrom these relations, we have $\\frac{\\text{SLD}_C}{\\text{SLD}_B} = k$ and $\\frac{P_{TOT,C}}{P_{TOT,B}} = k^2$.\nTherefore, the relationship between the fractional change in SLD and the fractional change in the product is:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{SLD}_C}{\\text{SLD}_B} = \\sqrt{\\frac{P_{TOT,C}}{P_{TOT,B}}} $$\nLet $\\Delta_{SLD}$ be the percentage change in SLD and $\\Delta_{P}$ be the percentage change in the product.\n$1 + \\Delta_{SLD} = \\frac{\\text{SLD}_C}{\\text{SLD}_B}$ and $1 + \\Delta_{P} = \\frac{P_{TOT,C}}{P_{TOT_B}}$.\nSubstituting these into our derived relationship gives the conversion formula:\n$$ 1 + \\Delta_{SLD} = \\sqrt{1 + \\Delta_{P}} \\implies \\Delta_{SLD} = \\sqrt{1 + \\Delta_{P}} - 1 $$\n\n### 2. iRECIST Definitions\n\nThe primary iRECIST response categories relevant here are defined as follows, using the baseline SLD ($\\text{SLD}_B$) and the nadir SLD ($\\text{SLD}_N$, the smallest SLD recorded to date, including baseline):\n- **immune Partial Response (iPR)**: At least a $30\\%$ decrease in SLD compared to baseline.\n- **immune Unconfirmed Progressive Disease (iUPD)**: At least a $20\\%$ increase in SLD compared to the nadir, **and** an absolute increase of at least $5 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$. This requires confirmation at a subsequent time point.\n- **immune Stable Disease (iSD)**: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for iPR nor sufficient increase to qualify for iUPD.\n- **immune Confirmed Progressive Disease (iCPD)**: An iUPD that is confirmed by further increase in tumor burden at the next assessment. If a patient with iUPD shows tumor shrinkage or stability at the next assessment, progression is not confirmed.\n\n### 3. Application to the Patient's Data\n\n**Givens**:\n- Baseline SLD: $\\text{SLD}_B = 100 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$.\n- The initial nadir is also $\\text{SLD}_N = 100 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n#### Week 8 Assessment\n\nThe radiology report indicates a $25\\%$ increase in bidimensional product relative to baseline.\n- $\\Delta_{P, W8} = +0.25$.\nUsing our conversion formula, the percentage change in SLD is:\n$$ \\Delta_{SLD, W8} = \\sqrt{1 + 0.25} - 1 = \\sqrt{1.25} - 1 \\approx 1.11803 - 1 = 0.11803 $$\nThis corresponds to an $11.8\\%$ increase in SLD.\nThe SLD at week $8$ is:\n$$ \\text{SLD}_{W8} = \\text{SLD}_B \\cdot (1 + \\Delta_{SLD, W8}) = 100 \\, \\mathrm{mm} \\cdot (1.11803) = 111.803 \\, \\mathrm{mm} $$\nNow, we apply iRECIST criteria:\n- The nadir SLD is $\\text{SLD}_N = 100 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Percentage increase from nadir: $\\frac{111.803 - 100}{100} = 11.803\\%$.\n- Absolute increase from nadir: $111.803 - 100 = 11.803 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$.\n- To qualify for iUPD, the percentage increase must be $\\ge 20\\%$ AND the absolute increase must be $\\ge 5 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$.\n- While the absolute increase ($11.803 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$) exceeds $5 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$, the percentage increase ($11.803\\%$) is less than $20\\%$.\n- Since both conditions are not met, the criteria for iUPD are not satisfied.\n- The change is not a sufficient decrease for iPR.\n- Therefore, the response at week $8$ is **immune Stable Disease (iSD)**.\n\n#### Week 12 Assessment\n\nThe radiology report indicates a $5\\%$ decrease in bidimensional product relative to baseline.\n- $\\Delta_{P, W12} = -0.05$.\nThe percentage change in SLD is:\n$$ \\Delta_{SLD, W12} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.05} - 1 = \\sqrt{0.95} - 1 \\approx 0.97468 - 1 = -0.02532 $$\nThis corresponds to a $2.53\\%$ decrease in SLD relative to baseline.\nThe SLD at week $12$ is:\n$$ \\text{SLD}_{W12} = \\text{SLD}_B \\cdot (1 + \\Delta_{SLD, W12}) = 100 \\, \\mathrm{mm} \\cdot (0.97468) = 97.468 \\, \\mathrm{mm} $$\nNow, we apply iRECIST criteria:\n- First, we update the nadir. The SLD values recorded are: Baseline ($100 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$), Week $8$ ($111.803 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$), and Week $12$ ($97.468 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$). The smallest value is $97.468 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$, so the new nadir is $\\text{SLD}_N = 97.468 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Check for iPR: The decrease from baseline is $\\frac{100 - 97.468}{100} = 2.53\\%$. This is less than the $30\\%$ threshold for iPR.\n- Check for iUPD: The current SLD is the nadir. There is no increase from nadir, so the criteria for iUPD are not met.\n- Therefore, the response at week $12$ is also **immune Stable Disease (iSD)**.\n\n### 4. Evaluation of Options\n\n- **A. Week 8: immune unconfirmed progressive disease (iUPD); Week 12: immune stable disease (iSD)**\n  **Incorrect**. The week $8$ assessment results in iSD, not iUPD. The calculated $11.8\\%$ increase in SLD does not meet the $20\\%$ threshold for iUPD. This option incorrectly assumes a $25\\%$ increase in product directly translates to meeting the unidimensional progression criteria.\n\n- **B. Week 8: immune stable disease (iSD); Week 12: immune stable disease (iSD)**\n  **Correct**. As derived above, the week $8$ SLD represents an $11.8\\%$ increase from nadir, which is classified as iSD. The week $12$ SLD represents a $2.53\\%$ decrease from baseline, which is also classified as iSD.\n\n- **C. Week 8: immune confirmed progressive disease (iCPD)**\n  **Incorrect**. iCPD cannot be assigned at the first time point of suspected progression. It requires a prior finding of iUPD and subsequent confirmation. Neither condition is met.\n\n- **D. Week 12: immune partial response (iPR)**\n  **Incorrect**. The week $12$ SLD of $97.468 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$ is a $2.53\\%$ decrease from the baseline of $100 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$. This is substantially less than the $30\\%$ decrease required for iPR.\n\n- **E. Week 8: immune unconfirmed progressive disease (iUPD); Week 12: immune confirmed progressive disease (iCPD)**\n  **Incorrect**. Week $8$ is iSD, not iUPD. Furthermore, for iCPD to be declared at week $12$, the tumor burden would need to have increased further from week $8$. Instead, it decreased from $111.8 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$ to $97.5 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4453139"}, {"introduction": "While immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, its power to activate the immune system carries the risk of significant immune-related adverse events (irAEs).
