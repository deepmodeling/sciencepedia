This is a classic application of Bayes' theorem, which updates a prior belief based on new evidence. We will use the odds–likelihood formulation of Bayes' theorem as requested.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant events and hypotheses:\nLet $H$ be the hypothesis that complete cytoreduction (CC) is achieved.\nLet $H^c$ be the hypothesis that CC is not achieved.\nLet $E_1$, $E_2$, and $E_3$ be the events that the three predictors are present (i.e., the tests are \"positive\"):\n$E_1$: Ascites volume $> 2$ L.\n$E_2$: Serum albumin $< 3.0$ g/dL.\n$E_3$: Radiologic porta hepatis encasement (PHE).\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\nThe prior probability of achieving CC is $P(H) = p_0 = 0.60$.\nThe prior probability of not achieving CC is therefore $P(H^c) = 1 - p_0 = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$.\n\nFor each predictor $E_i$, we are given its sensitivity ($\\mathrm{Se}_i$) and specificity ($\\mathrm{Sp}_i$) \"for the event of achieving CC\". This is a precise, albeit unconventional, definition. It establishes \"achieving CC\" (our hypothesis $H$) as the \"condition\" for which these metrics are defined.\nThus, for a given predictor $i$:\nSensitivity: $\\mathrm{Se}_i = P(E_i | H)$ (The probability of the predictor being present, given CC is achieved).\nSpecificity: $\\mathrm{Sp}_i = P(E_i^c | H^c)$ (The probability of the predictor being absent, given CC is not achieved).\n\nThe given values are:\nFor $E_1$: $\\mathrm{Se}_1 = 0.10$, $\\mathrm{Sp}_1 = 0.85$.\nFor $E_2$: $\\mathrm{Se}_2 = 0.12$, $\\mathrm{Sp}_2 = 0.80$.\nFor $E_3$: $\\mathrm{Se}_3 = 0.01$, $\\mathrm{Sp}_3 = 0.98$.\n\nThe odds–likelihood formulation of Bayes' theorem relates the posterior odds to the prior odds and the likelihood ratio (LR):\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Prior Odds} \\times \\text{Likelihood Ratio} $$\n$$ \\frac{P(H | E_1, E_2, E_3)}{P(H^c | E_1, E_2, E_3)} = \\frac{P(H)}{P(H^c)} \\times \\frac{P(E_1, E_2, E_3 | H)}{P(E_1, E_2, E_3 | H^c)} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the prior odds of achieving CC:\n$$ \\text{Prior Odds}(H) = \\frac{P(H)}{P(H^c)} = \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} = \\frac{0.60}{0.40} = 1.5 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the likelihood ratio for the combined evidence ($E_1, E_2, E_3$). The problem states that we should assume conditional independence of the predictors given the true outcome.

Before the specimen can be enclosed and withdrawn, a controlled cystotomy during oophorectomy leads to uncontained spillage of malignant fluid into the peritoneal cavity.

The concept of surgical spill influencing prognosis and staging is a well-established and critical concept in surgical oncology.

The definitions and numerical data are presented objectively, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n*   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. The patient's preoperative and intraoperative findings are detailed sufficiently to apply the staging rules. There are no contradictions. The initial findings (tumor confined to one ovary, intact capsule, negative cytology) perfectly describe the conditions for what would have been Stage IA, setting a clear baseline before the spill event.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-consistent. Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a two-part answer: the determination of the correct FIGO stage and the calculation of the change in recurrence risk.\n\n**Part 1: FIGO Staging**\n\nFirst, let us establish the patient's stage based on the provided information and FIGO criteria.\n1.  Without the surgical spill, the patient's findings are: tumor limited to one ovary, capsule intact prior to surgery, and negative peritoneal cytology (implying negative washings). According to the given definitions, this corresponds to **FIGO Stage IA**.\n2.  An intraoperative event occurred: \"uncontained spillage of malignant fluid into the peritoneal cavity,\" which is defined as a \"surgical spill.\"\n3.  The problem explicitly provides the FIGO classification for this event: \"Stage IC is tumor limited to one or both ovaries with any of the following risk features: surgical spill (IC1)...\"\n4.  Therefore, the surgical spill upgrades the patient's stage from what would have been Stage IA to **FIGO Stage IC1**.\n\n**Part 2: Recurrence Risk Calculation**\n\nNext, we calculate the absolute increase in the $5$-year recurrence risk. The problem specifies modeling this as the \"addition of a new, independent mechanism of failure.\" This implies that recurrence can now happen through two independent pathways: the baseline pathway (risk inherent to Stage IA disease) and the new spill-related pathway.\n\nLet $R_{base}$ be the event of recurrence via the baseline pathway. The probability is given as $P(R_{base}) = r_{\\text{IA}} = 0.18$.\nLet $R_{spill}$ be the event of recurrence via the new spill-related pathway. This event occurs only if the spillage leads to viable peritoneal dissemination *and* these disseminated cells survive to cause a clinical recurrence. The probability is the product of the probabilities of these sequential events:\n$$P(R_{spill}) = p_{s} \\times p_{p} = 0.30 \\times 0.50 = 0.15$$\n\nThe total probability of recurrence, $R_{total}$, is the probability that recurrence occurs through *at least one* of these independent pathways, i.e., $P(R_{base} \\cup R_{spill})$. For two independent events $A$ and $B$, the probability of their union is given by $P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)$.\n\nApplying this formula:\n$$R_{total} = P(R_{base}) + P(R_{spill}) - P(R_{base}) \\times P(R_{spill})$$\n$$R_{total} = r_{\\text{IA}} + (p_{s} \\times p_{p}) - r_{\\text{IA}} \\times (p_{s} \\times p_{p})$$\n$$R_{total} = 0.18 + 0.15 - (0.18 \\times 0.15)$$\n$$R_{total} = 0.33 - 0.027$$\n$$R_{total} = 0.303$$\n\nThe total $5$-year recurrence risk for this patient is $30.3\\%$.\n\nAlternatively, using the principle of survival, the probability of *not* recurring ($S_{total}$) is the probability of not recurring from the baseline pathway *and* not recurring from the spill pathway.\n$P(\\text{not } R_{base}) = 1 - r_{\\text{IA}} = 1 - 0.18 = 0.82$\n$P(\\text{not } R_{spill}) = 1 - (p_{s} \\times p_{p}) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$\n$S_{total} = P(\\text{not } R_{base}) \\times P(\\text{not } R_{spill}) = 0.82 \\times 0.85 = 0.697$\nThe total recurrence risk is $R_{total} = 1 - S_{total} = 1 - 0.697 = 0.303$. Both methods yield the same result.\n\nThe question asks for the **absolute increase in 5-year recurrence risk**. This is the difference between the new total risk and the baseline risk.\nAbsolute Increase $= R_{total} - r_{\\text{IA}}$\nAbsolute Increase $= 0.303 - 0.18 = 0.123$\n\nThis corresponds to an absolute increase of $12.3$ percentage points.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A. Surgical spill upgrades apparent stage IA/IB to FIGO stage IC1; the expected absolute increase in 5-year recurrence risk is about $12$ percentage points, yielding a total risk near $30 \\%$.**\n    *   **Staging:** Correct. The staging is upgraded to FIGO Stage IC1.\n    *   **Risk Calculation:** The calculated absolute increase is $12.3$ percentage points, which is \"about $12$ percentage points.\" The calculated total risk is $30.3\\%$, which is \"near $30\\%$.\" This option's statements are quantitatively accurate.\n    *   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. Surgical spill upgrades apparent stage IA/IB to FIGO stage IC2; the expected absolute increase in 5-year recurrence risk is about $15$ percentage points, yielding a total risk near $33 \\%$.**\n    *   **Staging:** Incorrect. Surgical spill corresponds to Stage IC1, not IC2. Stage IC2 is for preoperative rupture or tumor on the ovarian surface.\n    *   **Risk Calculation:** Incorrect. The value of $15$ percentage points ($0.15$) represents the risk from the spill pathway alone ($p_s \\times p_p$), not the absolute increase in total risk. The total risk of $33\\%$ improperly assumes simple additivity of probabilities ($0.18 + 0.15 = 0.33$) for independent, non-mutually exclusive events, which is mathematically unsound.\n    *   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. Surgical spill does not change stage if the capsule was intact before surgery; the expected absolute increase in 5-year recurrence risk is negligible, $<2$ percentage points.**\n    *   **Staging:** Incorrect. The FIGO definitions provided explicitly state that surgical spill is a staging criterion (IC1) regardless of the preoperative state of the capsule.\n    *   **Risk Calculation:** Incorrect.

The staging to IC1 is accurate.\n    *   **Risk Calculation:** Incorrect. The calculated absolute increase is $12.3\\%$, not $30\\%$. The total risk is $30.3\\%$, not near $50\\%$.
