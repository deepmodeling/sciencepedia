Mastering this quantitative skill is essential, as it directly connects the laboratory data from a micrograph to the critical clinical decision of assigning a stage. [@problem_id:4526469]", "problem": "A histopathology laboratory is validating how to compute depth of invasion for vulvar squamous cell carcinoma using printed micrographs that include an internal scale bar. Consider a resection specimen from a primary vulvar lesion that is clinically confined to the vulva with no clinical or radiologic evidence of regional lymph node involvement. On the hematoxylin and eosin section, the epithelial surface over the tumor is ulcerated. Following the accepted pathological definition, depth of invasion (DOI) is defined as the perpendicular distance from the epithelial–stromal junction at the most superficial adjacent dermal papilla (i.e., the original basement membrane level next to the ulcer) down to the deepest point of invasive tumor.\n\nA calibrated micrograph is printed on paper. The printed internal scale bar labeled “$200~\\mu\\text{m}$” measures $16~\\text{mm}$ when measured on the print with a ruler. On the same print, the measured perpendicular distance from the epithelial–stromal junction at the most superficial adjacent dermal papilla to the deepest invasive tumor nest is $72~\\text{mm}$. Assume the print magnification is isotropic and the scale bar is accurate.\n\nUsing only the definition of depth of invasion and the principle that a uniform magnification scales all linear dimensions by the same factor, compute the actual depth of invasion in millimeters. Then, based solely on the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2021 criteria for tumors confined to the vulva or perineum, determine whether the lesion is stage IA (depth of invasion $\\leq 1~\\text{mm}$) or stage IB (depth of invasion $> 1~\\text{mm}$).\n\nRound your computed depth of invasion to four significant figures and express it in millimeters. Your final answer should be only the numerical value of the depth of invasion.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides all necessary information and definitions to compute the depth of invasion and determine the corresponding pathological stage based on established medical criteria.\n\nThe fundamental principle underlying this calculation is that a micrograph represents a uniformly scaled version of the actual tissue specimen. This implies the existence of a single, constant magnification factor, $M$, that relates any length measured on the printed micrograph, $L_{print}$, to its corresponding actual length, $L_{actual}$. The relationship is given by:\n$$M = \\frac{L_{print}}{L_{actual}}$$\nThis relationship holds for all linear dimensions, assuming isotropic magnification as stated in the problem.\n\nWe can determine the magnification factor $M$ using the provided internal scale bar. Let $L_{scale, actual}$ be the actual length that the scale bar represents, and let $L_{scale, print}$ be the length of the scale bar as measured on the printed micrograph with a ruler.\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- The actual length represented by the scale bar: $L_{scale, actual} = 200~\\mu\\text{m}$\n- The measured length of the scale bar on the print: $L_{scale, print} = 16~\\text{mm}$\n\nTo maintain dimensional consistency, we must express these lengths in the same unit. The final answer is required in millimeters ($\\text{mm}$), so we will convert all units to millimeters. The conversion between micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$) and millimeters ($\\text{mm}$) is $1~\\text{mm} = 1000~\\mu\\text{m}$.\nTherefore, the actual length of the scale bar in millimeters is:\n$$L_{scale, actual} = 200~\\mu\\text{m} \\times \\frac{1~\\text{mm}}{1000~\\mu\\text{m}} = 0.2~\\text{mm}$$\n\nNow, we can express the magnification factor, $M$, as the ratio of the printed length to the actual length of the scale bar:\n$$M = \\frac{L_{scale, print}}{L_{scale, actual}} = \\frac{16~\\text{mm}}{0.2~\\text{mm}} = 80$$\nThe magnification is a dimensionless quantity. The micrograph is magnified $80$ times.\n\nNext, we apply this same magnification factor to the measured depth of invasion (DOI). Let $L_{DOI, print}$ be the measured perpendicular distance on the print and $L_{DOI, actual}$ be the true, unknown depth of invasion.\nWe are given:\n- The measured DOI on the print: $L_{DOI, print} = 72~\\text{mm}$\n\nThe relationship is:\n$$M = \\frac{L_{DOI, print}}{L_{DOI, actual}}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the actual depth of invasion, $L_{DOI, actual}$:\n$$L_{DOI, actual} = \\frac{L_{DOI, print}}{M}$$\nSubstituting the known values for $L_{DOI, print}$ and $M$:\n$$L_{DOI, actual} = \\frac{72~\\text{mm}}{80}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$L_{DOI, actual} = 0.9~\\text{mm}$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.9~\\text{mm}$ has one significant figure. To express this value with four significant figures, we must add trailing zeros after the decimal point.\n$$L_{DOI, actual} = 0.9000~\\text{mm}$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to determine the pathological stage based on the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2021 criteria for tumors confined to the vulva or perineum with no nodal involvement.

It refers to a \"contemporary, internationally accepted staging framework,\" which corresponds to the FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) 2021 staging system. The parameters provided—lesion size, DOI, anatomic extent, and nodal status—are the exact components of this system. The definition of DOI given in the problem is precise and consistent with the 2021 FIGO guidelines. The problem is scientifically sound.\n\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides all necessary information to apply the FIGO 2021 staging criteria. The data for each scenario are clear and unambiguous. The question asks for a determinate output (the stage for each lesion) based on a formal classification system, thus a unique and stable solution exists.\n\n3.  **Objectivity:** The language is clinical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology. All measurements are given as quantitative values.\n\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The setup is complete and internally consistent. The provided information is sufficient for staging. The inclusion of \"tumor thickness\" alongside \"depth of invasion\" is a realistic detail that tests the specific knowledge of which measurement is relevant for staging under the current system, but it does not create a contradiction.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective application of a standard medical classification system. The solution can proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe governing principle for this problem is the FIGO 2021 staging classification for carcinoma of the vulva. Staging is based on the TNM system (Tumor, Nodes, Metastasis). The problem describes tumors confined to the vulva with negative nodes, which fall under Stage I. The distinction within Stage I depends on tumor size and depth of stromal invasion (DOI).\n\nThe relevant FIGO 2021 definitions for Stage I are as follows:\n*   **Stage I:** Tumor confined to the vulva or perineum. No nodal metastasis.\n    *   **Stage IA:** Tumor size $\\le 2 \\mathrm{cm}$ AND depth of stromal invasion (DOI) $\\le 1.0 \\mathrm{mm}$.\n    *   **Stage IB:** Tumor with any of the following characteristics: size $> 2 \\mathrm{cm}$ OR depth of stromal invasion (DOI) $> 1.0 \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nWe will now apply these criteria to each scenario.\n\n**Analysis of Scenario 1 (First lesion):**\n*   **Tumor Size:** $1.5 \\mathrm{cm}$. This satisfies the condition size $\\le 2 \\mathrm{cm}$.\n*   **Depth of Invasion (DOI):** $0.8 \\mathrm{mm}$. This satisfies the condition DOI $\\le 1.0 \\mathrm{mm}$.\n*   **Anatomic Extent:** The tumor is confined to the vulva.\n*   **Nodal Status:** Nodes are negative.\n\nSince the tumor is confined to the vulva with negative nodes, it is Stage I. To sub-stage, we check the criteria for Stage IA. Both conditions (size $\\le 2 \\mathrm{cm}$ AND DOI $\\le 1.0 \\mathrm{mm}$) are met.\nTherefore, the first lesion is **Stage IA**.\n\n**Analysis of Scenario 2 (Second lesion):**\n*   **Tumor Size:** $1.5 \\mathrm{cm}$. This satisfies the condition size $\\le 2 \\mathrm{cm}$.\n*   **Depth of Invasion (DOI):** $1.2 \\mathrm{mm}$. This violates the condition DOI $\\le 1.0 \\mathrm{mm}$.\n*   **Anatomic Extent:** The tumor is confined to the vulva.\n*   **Nodal Status:** Nodes are negative.\n\nSince the tumor is confined to the vulva with negative nodes, it is Stage I. We check the sub-staging criteria.\n*   Is it Stage IA? No, because the Stage IA criterion requires *both* size $\\le 2 \\mathrm{cm}$ and DOI $\\le 1.0 \\mathrm{mm}$. The DOI of $1.2 \\mathrm{mm}$ fails this.\n*   Is it Stage IB? The Stage IB criterion requires *either* size $> 2 \\mathrm{cm}$ OR DOI $> 1.0 \\mathrm{mm}$. The condition DOI $> 1.0 \\mathrm{mm}$ is met, as $1.2 \\mathrm{mm} > 1.0 \\mathrm{mm}$.\nTherefore, the second lesion is **Stage IB**.\n\nThe correct pairing of stages is: First lesion (DOI $0.8 \\mathrm{mm}$) is Stage IA, and Second lesion (DOI $1.2 \\mathrm{mm}$) is Stage IB.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A. First lesion: Stage IA; Second lesion: Stage IB**\n    This option correctly identifies the first lesion as Stage IA and the second lesion as Stage IB, matching our derivation.\n    Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. First lesion: Stage IB; Second lesion: Stage IA**\n    This option incorrectly reverses the stages. The first lesion meets the criteria for Stage IA, not IB. The second lesion meets the criteria for Stage IB, not IA.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. First lesion: Stage IA; Second lesion: Stage IA**\n    This option correctly identifies the stage of the first lesion but incorrectly stages the second. The second lesion has a DOI of $1.2 \\mathrm{mm}$, which exceeds the $1.0 \\mathrm{mm}$ threshold for Stage IA, thus classifying it as Stage IB.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. First lesion: Stage IB; Second lesion: Stage IB**\n    This option incorrectly stages the first lesion. The first lesion has a size of $1.5 \\mathrm{cm}$ and a DOI of $0.8 \\mathrm{mm}$, both of which fall within the criteria for Stage IA.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E. First lesion: Stage IA; Second lesion: Stage II**\n    This option incorrectly stages the second lesion as Stage II. According to FIGO 2021, Stage II is defined as a tumor of any size with extension to adjacent perineal structures (lower $1/3$ urethra, lower $1/3$ vagina, anus), with negative nodes.

This discrepancy does not invalidate the problem, as the core task is to determine the *updated* stage based on the *final pathology*. The inaccuracy of the provisional staging is part of the clinical narrative and does not affect the calculation of the correct final answer. The problem is a straightforward application of a well-defined classification system.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution will proceed by applying the FIGO staging criteria to the final pathological findings.\n\n## SOLUTION\n\nThe problem requires determining the correct FIGO stage for a patient with vulvar cancer based on final histopathological findings. The staging of vulvar cancer is determined by the TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) classification, as defined by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). The most recent revision is the 2021 FIGO staging system.\n\n**1. Determine the T (Primary Tumor) Stage:**\nThe primary vulvar lesion is described as being $2.8\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ in greatest dimension with a stromal invasion depth of $4.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The tumor is confined to the vulva.\nAccording to the FIGO 2021 staging:\n- **T1:** Tumor confined to the vulva or perineum.\n  - **T1a:** Tumor size $\\leq 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ AND stromal invasion $\\leq 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n  - **T1b:** Tumor size $> 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ OR stromal invasion $> 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **T2:** Tumor of any size with extension to adjacent perineal structures ($1/3$ lower urethra, $1/3$ lower vagina, anus).\n- **T3:** Tumor of any size with extension to upper part of adjacent perineal structures ($2/3$ upper urethra, $2/3$ upper vagina) or with gross-local invasion of any of the following structures: bladder mucosa, rectal mucosa or fixed to pelvic bone.\n\nThe patient's tumor is $2.8\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ (which is $> 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$) and has a stromal invasion of $4.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ (which is $> 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$). The tumor is confined to the vulva. This corresponds to a **T1b** classification.\n\n**2. Determine the N (Regional Lymph Node) Stage:**\nThe regional lymph nodes for vulvar cancer are the inguinofemoral lymph nodes. The final pathology report is the definitive source for N staging.\n- Total number of metastatic lymph nodes: $3$\n- Sizes of metastatic deposits: $6.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $3.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $2.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Key finding: The $6.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ metastasis has **extracapsular extension (ECE)**.\n\nAccording to the FIGO 2021 nodal staging:\n- **N1a:** One or two lymph node metastasis(es) each $ 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **N1b:** One lymph node metastasis $\\geq 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **N2a:** Three or more lymph node metastasis(es) each $ 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **N2b:** Two or more lymph node metastasis(es), at least one of which is $\\geq 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **N2c:** Lymph node metastasis(es) with extracapsular spread.\n- **N3:** Fixed or ulcerated regional lymph node metastasis(es) or pelvic lymph node metastasis(es).\n\nThe patient has a lymph node metastasis with confirmed extracapsular extension (ECE). The presence of ECE is a specific criterion that automatically classifies the nodal status. Therefore, the patient's nodal stage is **N2c**. The number and size of the nodes are superseded by the presence of ECE for N-classification. The problem also states there is no evidence of fixed or ulcerated nodes, ruling out N3.\n\n**3. Determine the M (Distant Metastasis) Stage:**\nThe problem states \"Preoperative imaging shows no ... distant disease\" and on final assessment, \"no distant metastases\". This corresponds to an **M0** classification.\n\n**4. Determine the Overall FIGO Stage:**\nThe overall stage is determined by combining the T, N, and M classifications.\n- **Stage IIIA:** T1/T2, N1a/N1b, M0\n- **Stage IIIB:** T1/T2, N2a/N2b, M0\n- **Stage IIIC:** T1/T2, N2c, M0  OR  T3, any N, M0\n- **Stage IVA:** Any T, N3, M0  OR  T4, any N, M0\n- **Stage IVB:** Any T, any N, M1\n\nThe patient's final staging is T1b, N2c, M0.\nSubstituting these into the stage group definitions:\n- The patient's T-stage is T1.\n- The patient's N-stage is N2c.\n- The patient's M-stage is M0.\nThis combination (T1, N2c, M0) fits the criteria for **Stage IIIC**.\n\n### OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. Stage IIIA**\nThis stage corresponds to T1/T2, N1a/N1b, M0. The patient's N-stage is N2c due to the presence of extracapsular extension. N2c is a more advanced nodal stage than N1a or N1b. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**B. Stage IIIB**\nThis stage corresponds to T1/T2, N2a/N2b, M0. Without the finding of ECE, the patient's nodal status (three positive nodes, one $\\geq 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) would have been N2b, and the stage would have been IIIB. However, the definitive final pathology identified ECE, which upgrades the nodal stage to N2c. N2c defines Stage IIIC, not IIIB. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**C. Stage IIIC**\nThis stage includes the combination T1/T2, N2c, M0. The patient's classification is T1b, N2c, M0, which fits this definition precisely. The presence of extracapsular extension is the critical determinant that leads to this stage. Therefore, this option is **Correct**.\n\n**D. Stage IVA**\nThis stage requires T4 disease (invasion of upper urethra/vagina, bladder/rectal mucosa, or fixed to bone), or N3 disease (fixed, ulcerated, or pelvic nodes). The patient has a T1b tumor and N2c nodal status. The problem explicitly rules out T4 and N3 criteria. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n**E. Stage IVB**\nThis stage requires the presence of distant metastasis (M1). The problem explicitly states the patient is M0. Therefore, this option is incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4526485"}]}
