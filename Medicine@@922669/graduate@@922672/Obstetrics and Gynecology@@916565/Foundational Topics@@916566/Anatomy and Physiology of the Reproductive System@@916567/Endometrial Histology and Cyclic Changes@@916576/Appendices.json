No contradictions are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is **valid**. A solution can be derived by applying knowledge of endometrial histology to the provided data.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires correlating the measured parameters ($t$, $s$, $e$) with the known histological changes of the endometrium during the secretory phase. The target is the mid-secretory phase (approximately $LH+7$ to $LH+10$), which corresponds to the window of implantation.\n\n**First Principles of Secretory Phase Histology:**\n\n1.  **Gland Tortuosity ($t$):** After ovulation, progesterone stimulation causes the endometrial glands, which are straight during the proliferative phase, to grow and become increasingly coiled and tortuous. This tortuosity continues to increase throughout the secretory phase, reaching a maximum in the late secretory phase. Therefore, for the mid-secretory phase, we expect a **high** value of $t$.\n\n2.  **Secretion Prevalence ($s$):** Progesterone also stimulates glandular epithelial cells to produce glycogen-rich secretions. Initially, these accumulate as subnuclear vacuoles (early secretory, $LH+2$ to $LH+4$). These vacuoles then move to the apical cell surface, and their contents are released into the glandular lumens. Luminal secretion becomes prominent around $LH+6$ and is a hallmark of the mid-secretory phase. Therefore, we expect a **high** value of $s$.\n\n3.  **Stromal Edema ($e$):** Stromal edema (accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space) is one of the most dynamic features. It begins to increase in the early secretory phase, reaches a distinct **peak** around day $LH+7$, and then begins to decrease as the stroma becomes more compact and undergoes predecidualization in the second half of the secretory phase. Therefore, for the window of $LH+7$ to $LH+10$, we expect edema to be prominent but likely **declining from its peak value**. A very low value would indicate the late secretory phase, and a peak value would correspond to the beginning of the mid-secretory window.\n\n**Application of Principles to Biopsy Data:**\n\nWe are looking for biopsies with high $t$, high $s$, and moderate-to-high $e$ (post-peak). Let's evaluate each biopsy:\n\n-   **$B_1$: $t=1.4$, $s=20\\%$, $e=0.54$.**\n    -   The tortuosity ($t=1.4$) and secretion ($s=20\\%$) are both low. This indicates that the secretory transformation is not well-established.\n    -   The edema ($e=0.54$) is the highest of all samples.\n    -   This combination of low glandular development with very high edema is characteristic of the **early secretory phase** (approx. $LH+3$ to $LH+5$), when edema is increasing towards its peak but glands have not yet become highly tortuous or secretory. This biopsy is not from the mid-secretory phase.\n\n-   **$B_2$: $t=2.6$, $s=62\\%$, $e=0.39$.**\n    -   The tortuosity ($t=2.6$) is high.\n    -   The secretion ($s=62\\%$) is high.\n    -   The edema ($e=0.39$) is moderate-to-high, consistent with a post-peak level.\n    -   All three parameters align perfectly with the characteristics of the **mid-secretory phase** ($LH+7$ to $LH+10$). This biopsy is a strong candidate.\n\n-   **$B_3$: $t=3.0$, $s=78\\%$, $e=0.19$.**\n    -   The tortuosity ($t=3.0$) is very high, suggesting maximal glandular coiling.\n    -   The secretion ($s=78\\%$) is very high.\n    -   The edema ($e=0.19$) is low. This indicates that the stroma has become compact, which is a feature of advancing predecidualization.\n    -   The combination of maximal glandular development with resolved edema is the classic picture of the **late secretory phase** (approx. $LH+11$ or later), which is past the receptive window. This biopsy is not from the mid-secretory phase.\n\n-   **$B_4$: $t=1.9$, $s=36\\%$, $e=0.47$.**\n    -   The tortuosity ($t=1.9$) and secretion ($s=36\\%$) are moderate.\n    -   The edema ($e=0.47$) is high.\n    -   This profile is more advanced than $B_1$ but less developed than $B_2$ or $B_5$. It represents a transition, likely the **late-early or early-mid secretory phase** (approx. $LH+5$ to $LH+6$). The glands are not yet fully transformed for the receptive window.\n\n-   **$B_5$: $t=2.3$, $s=68\\%$, $e=0.34$.**\n    -   The tortuosity ($t=2.3$) is high.\n    -   The secretion ($s=68\\%$) is high.\n    -   The edema ($e=0.34$) is moderate, consistent with a post-peak level.\n    -   This profile is very similar to $B_2$. All three parameters are strongly consistent with the **mid-secretory phase**. This biopsy is also a strong candidate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the first-principles analysis of endometrial histology, biopsies $B_2$ and $B_5$ are the only ones whose quantitative features (high tortuosity, high secretion, and moderate, resolving edema) are collectively characteristic of the mid-secretory receptive phase ($LH+7$ to $LH+10$).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A. $B_2$ only:** This is incorrect because the analysis shows that biopsy $B_5$ is also highly consistent with the mid-secretory phase, exhibiting a similar profile to $B_2$.

Both $B_2$ ($t=2.6, s=62\\%, e=0.39$) and $B_5$ ($t=2.3, s=68\\%, e=0.34$) display the classic hallmarks of a mid-secretory endometrium: highly developed glands (high $t$ and $s$) and a stroma with moderate, post-peak edema (moderate $e$).\n-   **C. $B_3$ and $B_5$:** This is incorrect because $B_3$ ($t=3.0, s=78\\%, e=0.19$) is characteristic of the late secretory phase due to its very low stromal edema, indicating it is past the window of implantation.\n-   **D. $B_2$, $B_3$, and $B_5$:** This is incorrect because it includes $B_3$, which represents a late secretory endometrium.\n-   **E. $B_1$ and $B_4$:** This is incorrect.

The following raw counts were recorded:\n\nDay $19$:\n- Epithelium: total nuclei $N_{\\mathrm{e},19} = 520$.\n  - ER-positive nuclei $P^{\\mathrm{ER}}_{\\mathrm{e},19} = 52$.\n  - PR-positive nuclei $P^{\\mathrm{PR}}_{\\mathrm{e},19} = 312$.\n- Stroma: total nuclei $N_{\\mathrm{s},19} = 560$.\n  - ER-positive nuclei $P^{\\mathrm{ER}}_{\\mathrm{s},19} = 280$.\n  - PR-positive nuclei $P^{\\mathrm{PR}}_{\\mathrm{s},19} = 392$.\n\nDay $21$:\n- Epithelium: total nuclei $N_{\\mathrm{e},21} = 500$.\n  - ER-positive nuclei $P^{\\mathrm{ER}}_{\\mathrm{e},21} = 20$.\n  - PR-positive nuclei $P^{\\mathrm{PR}}_{\\mathrm{e},21} = 150$.\n- Stroma: total nuclei $N_{\\mathrm{s},21} = 600$.\n  - ER-positive nuclei $P^{\\mathrm{ER}}_{\\mathrm{s},21} = 210$.\n  - PR-positive nuclei $P^{\\mathrm{PR}}_{\\mathrm{s},21} = 360$.\n\nUsing the core definition that the compartmental positivity fraction for receptor $R$ on day $d$ is $f_{c,R}(d) = P^{R}_{c,d} / N_{c,d}$ for compartment $c \\in \\{\\mathrm{e}, \\mathrm{s}\\}$, and that the whole-endometrium positivity fraction is the nucleus-count-weighted mean across compartments, defined by weights $w_{c}(d) = N_{c,d} / \\left(N_{\\mathrm{e},d} + N_{\\mathrm{s},d}\\right)$, compute the signed changes in whole-endometrium ER and PR positivity from day $19$ to day $21$, i.e., $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ER}} = F_{\\mathrm{ER}}(21) - F_{\\mathrm{ER}}(19)$ and $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PR}} = F_{\\mathrm{PR}}(21) - F_{\\mathrm{PR}}(19)$, where $F_{R}(d)$ is the weighted mean positivity fraction for receptor $R$ on day $d$.\n\nReport the final answer as a row matrix in the order $\\left(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ER}}, \\Delta_{\\mathrm{PR}}\\right)$, expressed as decimal fractions (unitless) and rounded to four significant figures.

All specified conditions are internally consistent and plausible. I will therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the signed change in whole-endometrium positivity fractions for the Estrogen Receptor (ER) and Progesterone Receptor (PR) between day $19$ and day $21$ of the menstrual cycle. The changes are denoted as $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ER}} = F_{\\mathrm{ER}}(21) - F_{\\mathrm{ER}}(19)$ and $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PR}} = F_{\\mathrm{PR}}(21) - F_{\\mathrm{PR}}(19)$.\n\nFirst, we must establish the precise formula for the whole-endometrium positivity fraction, $F_{R}(d)$, for a given receptor $R \\in \\{\\mathrm{ER}, \\mathrm{PR}\\}$ on a given day $d \\in \\{19, 21\\}$. The problem defines this as the nucleus-count-weighted mean across the epithelial ($c=\\mathrm{e}$) and stromal ($c=\\mathrm{s}$) compartments. The general formula for a weighted mean is:\n$$F_{R}(d) = w_{\\mathrm{e}}(d) f_{\\mathrm{e},R}(d) + w_{\\mathrm{s}}(d) f_{\\mathrm{s},R}(d)$$\nThe weights $w_{c}(d)$ and compartmental positivity fractions $f_{c,R}(d)$ are explicitly defined in the problem statement:\n$$w_{c}(d) = \\frac{N_{c,d}}{N_{\\mathrm{e},d} + N_{\\mathrm{s},d}}$$\n$$f_{c,R}(d) = \\frac{P^{R}_{c,d}}{N_{c,d}}$$\nwhere $N_{c,d}$ is the total number of nuclei in compartment $c$ on day $d$, and $P^{R}_{c,d}$ is the number of receptor-positive nuclei within that compartment.\n\nBy substituting the definitions for the weights and compartmental fractions into the expression for $F_{R}(d)$, we can derive a simplified expression:\n$$F_{R}(d) = \\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{e},d}}{N_{\\mathrm{e},d} + N_{\\mathrm{s},d}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{P^{R}_{\\mathrm{e},d}}{N_{\\mathrm{e},d}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{s},d}}{N_{\\mathrm{e},d} + N_{\\mathrm{s},d}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{P^{R}_{\\mathrm{s},d}}{N_{\\mathrm{s},d}}\\right)$$\nThe terms for the total nuclei in each compartment, $N_{\\mathrm{e},d}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{s},d}$, cancel in the numerator and denominator of their respective terms:\n$$F_{R}(d) = \\frac{P^{R}_{\\mathrm{e},d}}{N_{\\mathrm{e},d} + N_{\\mathrm{s},d}} + \\frac{P^{R}_{\\mathrm{s},d}}{N_{\\mathrm{e},d} + N_{\\mathrm{s},d}}$$\nThis expression simplifies to the total number of receptor-positive nuclei across both compartments divided by the total number of all nuclei sampled on that day:\n$$F_{R}(d) = \\frac{P^{R}_{\\mathrm{e},d} + P^{R}_{\\mathrm{s},d}}{N_{\\mathrm{e},d} + N_{\\mathrm{s},d}}$$\n\nWe now apply this simplified formula using the provided data for day $19$ and day $21$.\n\nFor day $d=19$:\nThe total number of nuclei is $N_{\\mathrm{tot},19} = N_{\\mathrm{e},19} + N_{\\mathrm{s},19} = 520 + 560 = 1080$.\nThe total number of ER-positive nuclei is $P^{\\mathrm{ER}}_{\\mathrm{tot},19} = P^{\\mathrm{ER}}_{\\mathrm{e},19} + P^{\\mathrm{ER}}_{\\mathrm{s},19} = 52 + 280 = 332$.\nThe total number of PR-positive nuclei is $P^{\\mathrm{PR}}_{\\mathrm{tot},19} = P^{\\mathrm{PR}}_{\\mathrm{e},19} + P^{\\mathrm{PR}}_{\\mathrm{s},19} = 312 + 392 = 704$.\n\nThe whole-endometrium positivity fractions on day $19$ are:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ER}}(19) = \\frac{332}{1080}$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{PR}}(19) = \\frac{704}{1080}$$\n\nFor day $d=21$:\nThe total number of nuclei is $N_{\\mathrm{tot},21} = N_{\\mathrm{e},21} + N_{\\mathrm{s},21} = 500 + 600 = 1100$.\nThe total number of ER-positive nuclei is $P^{\\mathrm{ER}}_{\\mathrm{tot},21} = P^{\\mathrm{ER}}_{\\mathrm{e},21} + P^{\\mathrm{ER}}_{\\mathrm{s},21} = 20 + 210 = 230$.\nThe total number of PR-positive nuclei is $P^{\\mathrm{PR}}_{\\mathrm{tot},21} = P^{\\mathrm{PR}}_{\\mathrm{e},21} + P^{\\mathrm{PR}}_{\\mathrm{s},21} = 150 + 360 = 510$.\n\nThe whole-endometrium positivity fractions on day $21$ are:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ER}}(21) = \\frac{230}{1100}$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{PR}}(21) = \\frac{510}{1100}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the required signed changes, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ER}}$ and $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PR}}$.\nFor the Estrogen Receptor:\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ER}} = F_{\\mathrm{ER}}(21) - F_{\\mathrm{ER}}(19) = \\frac{230}{1100} - \\frac{332}{1080}$$\nNumerically, $F_{\\mathrm{ER}}(21) \\approx 0.2090909...$ and $F_{\\mathrm{ER}}(19) \\approx 0.3074074...$\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ER}} \\approx 0.2090909 - 0.3074074 = -0.0983165...$$\n\nFor the Progesterone Receptor:\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PR}} = F_{\\mathrm{PR}}(21) - F_{\\mathrm{PR}}(19) = \\frac{510}{1100} - \\frac{704}{1080}$$\nNumerically, $F_{\\mathrm{PR}}(21) \\approx 0.4636363...$ and $F_{\\mathrm{PR}}(19) \\approx 0.6518518...$\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PR}} \\approx 0.4636363 - 0.6518518 = -0.1882155...$$\n\nThe problem requires the results expressed as decimal fractions rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{ER}} \\approx -0.09832$$\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{PR}} \\approx -0.1882$$\nThese negative values indicate a decrease in the overall expression of both receptors from day $19$ to day $21$, which is consistent with the expected progesterone-driven downregulation of steroid receptors in the mid- to late-luteal phase of the endometrial cycle.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -0.09832 & -0.1882 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4432635"}]}
