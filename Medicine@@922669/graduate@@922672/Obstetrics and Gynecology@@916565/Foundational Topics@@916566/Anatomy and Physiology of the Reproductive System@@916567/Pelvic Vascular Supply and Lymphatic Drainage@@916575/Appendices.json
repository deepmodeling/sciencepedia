A solution will be provided, starting from the first principles as requested.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a determination of the change in volumetric flow rate, starting from first principles for laminar flow in a rigid tube. This entails deriving the Hagen–Poiseuille equation.\n\nConsider a cylindrical pipe of radius $R$ and length $L$. For steady, laminar flow of an incompressible fluid, there is a balance between the pressure force driving the flow and the viscous drag force opposing it. Let us analyze the forces on a cylinder of fluid of radius $r$ (where $r \\le R$) concentric with the pipe axis.\n\nThe pressure force is the pressure difference $\\Delta P$ acting on the cross-sectional area $\\pi r^2$:\n$$F_{\\text{pressure}} = \\Delta P (\\pi r^2)$$\n\nThe viscous drag force acts on the cylindrical surface area $2\\pi r L$. According to Newton's law of viscosity, the shear stress $\\tau$ is related to the velocity gradient $\\frac{dv}{dr}$. To be precise, $\\tau = -\\eta \\frac{dv}{dr}$, where the negative sign indicates that the fluid velocity $v$ decreases as the radial distance $r$ from the center increases. The drag force is:\n$$F_{\\text{viscous}} = \\tau (2\\pi r L) = \\left(-\\eta \\frac{dv}{dr}\\right)(2\\pi r L)$$\n\nFor steady flow (no acceleration), the net force is zero, so $F_{\\text{pressure}} + F_{\\text{viscous}} = 0$.\n$$\\Delta P (\\pi r^2) - \\eta \\frac{dv}{dr} (2\\pi r L) = 0$$\nRearranging to solve for the velocity gradient:\n$$\\frac{dv}{dr} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2 \\eta L} r$$\n\nTo find the velocity profile $v(r)$, we integrate this expression with respect to $r$:\n$$v(r) = \\int -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2 \\eta L} r \\, dr = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\eta L} r^2 + C$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. We apply the no-slip boundary condition at the wall of the artery, which has a total radius we will now call $R$. At $r=R$, the fluid velocity is zero, so $v(R)=0$.\n$$0 = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\eta L} R^2 + C \\implies C = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\eta L} R^2$$\nSubstituting $C$ back into the velocity equation gives the parabolic velocity profile for laminar flow:\n$$v(r) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\eta L} (R^2 - r^2)$$\n\nThe volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is the integral of the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the pipe. We integrate infinitesimal annular rings of area $dA = 2\\pi r dr$:\n$$Q = \\int_{0}^{R} v(r) dA = \\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{\\Delta P}{4 \\eta L} (R^2 - r^2) (2\\pi r) dr$$\nFactoring out the constants:\n$$Q = \\frac{2\\pi \\Delta P}{4 \\eta L} \\int_{0}^{R} (R^2 r - r^3) dr = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2 \\eta L} \\left[ \\frac{R^2 r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_0^R$$\nEvaluating the integral at the limits:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2 \\eta L} \\left( \\left( \\frac{R^4}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) - (0) \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2 \\eta L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right)$$\nThis yields the Hagen–Poiseuille equation:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi R^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nThis equation expresses the volumetric flow rate $Q$ as a function of the pipe radius $R$, pressure drop $\\Delta P$, fluid viscosity $\\eta$, and pipe length $L$.\n\nNow we apply this relationship to the problem. Let $Q_{\\text{before}}$ be the flow rate with radius $r_{\\text{before}}$ and $Q_{\\text{after}}$ be the flow rate with radius $r_{\\text{after}}$.\nThe flow rate before the radius change is:\n$$Q_{\\text{before}} = \\frac{\\pi (r_{\\text{before}})^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nThe flow rate after the radius change is:\n$$Q_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{\\pi (r_{\\text{after}})^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nThe problem states that $\\Delta P$, $L$, and $\\eta$ are constant. We are asked to find the multiplicative change in flow rate, which is the ratio $Q_{\\text{after}} / Q_{\\text{before}}$.\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{after}}}{Q_{\\text{before}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi (r_{\\text{after}})^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}}{\\frac{\\pi (r_{\\text{before}})^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}}$$\nThe constant terms $\\pi$, $\\Delta P$, $8$, $\\eta$, and $L$ cancel out, leaving:\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{after}}}{Q_{\\text{before}}} = \\frac{(r_{\\text{after}})^4}{(r_{\\text{before}})^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_{\\text{after}}}{r_{\\text{before}}}\\right)^4$$\nThis shows that the volumetric flow rate is proportional to the fourth power of the radius, a key consequence of the Hagen-Poiseuille law.\n\nWe are given the values $r_{\\text{before}} = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and $r_{\\text{after}} = 2.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.

This can be stated as:\n- The probability of a miss, given that a contralateral node exists, is $1$:\n  $$P(M | S) = 1$$\n- If a contralateral node does not exist (event $S^c$), it cannot be missed.
