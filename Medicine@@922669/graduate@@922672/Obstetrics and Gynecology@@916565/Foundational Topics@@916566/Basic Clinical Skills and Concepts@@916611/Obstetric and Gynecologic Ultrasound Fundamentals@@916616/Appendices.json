A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires deriving the relationship between the inter-element time delay and the beam steering angle from first principles. We consider a one-dimensional linear array of identical elements. Let the position of the $n$-th element along the array be $x_n = n \\cdot d$, where $d$ is the pitch (center-to-center spacing) and $n$ is an integer index.\n\nA progressive time delay is applied to each element. The signal transmitted by element $n$ is delayed by a time $t_n = n \\cdot \\Delta t$ relative to a reference element (e.g., $n=0$), where $\\Delta t$ is the constant progressive inter-element time delay.\n\nThe wave emitted by element $n$ can be described as a function of time $t$ and position. At a far-field point, the phase of the wave from element $n$ depends on both the transmission time delay $t_n$ and the path length from the element to the observation point. A plane wave propagating at an angle $\\theta$ relative to the array normal has a coherent wavefront. For constructive interference to occur in this direction, the signals from all elements must arrive at this wavefront in phase.\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary plane (the wavefront) in the far-field, perpendicular to the direction of propagation $\\theta$. The path length from element $n$ to this plane is shorter than the path length from element $0$ by an amount $\\Delta L_n = x_n \\sin(\\theta) = n d \\sin(\\theta)$. This geometric path difference introduces a time-of-flight difference.\n\nThe total phase of the signal from element $n$ at the distant wavefront can be expressed as:\n$$ \\Phi_n = \\omega t - k r_n - \\omega t_n $$\nwhere $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is the angular frequency, $k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\omega}{c}$ is the wavenumber, $c$ is the speed of sound, and $r_n$ is the distance from element $n$ to the observation point. In the far-field, we can approximate the distance $r_n$ for phase calculations as $r_n \\approx R - n d \\sin(\\theta)$, where $R$ is the distance from the array center ($n=0$) to the point.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $t_n$ and $r_n$ into the phase equation:\n$$ \\Phi_n = \\omega t - k (R - n d \\sin(\\theta)) - \\omega (n \\Delta t) $$\n$$ \\Phi_n = (\\omega t - kR) + n (k d \\sin(\\theta) - \\omega \\Delta t) $$\nFor the waves from all elements to be in phase along the direction $\\theta$, the phase $\\Phi_n$ must be the same for all $n$ (modulo $2\\pi$). This means the term that depends on $n$ must be zero for the main lobe.\n$$ n (k d \\sin(\\theta) - \\omega \\Delta t) = 0 $$\nSince this must hold for any element $n$, the term in the parenthesis must be zero:\n$$ k d \\sin(\\theta) - \\omega \\Delta t = 0 $$\nRearranging for $\\Delta t$:\n$$ \\omega \\Delta t = k d \\sin(\\theta) $$\nSubstituting $k = \\omega/c$:\n$$ \\omega \\Delta t = \\frac{\\omega}{c} d \\sin(\\theta) $$\nSince the frequency $f$ is non-zero, $\\omega$ is also non-zero and can be cancelled from both sides. This yields the fundamental relationship between the inter-element time delay and the steering angle:\n$$ \\Delta t = \\frac{d \\sin(\\theta)}{c} $$\nThis result is intuitive: the applied electronic time delay $\\Delta t$ must exactly compensate for the natural propagation time difference, $\\frac{d \\sin(\\theta)}{c}$, caused by the geometric path difference between adjacent elements to form a tilted wavefront.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nNext, we compute the numerical value for $\\Delta t$ using the given parameters.\n1.  **Givens**:\n    -   Center frequency, $f = 7\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 7 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n    -   Speed of sound, $c = 1540\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n    -   Steering angle, $\\theta = 20^{\\circ}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the acoustic wavelength ($\\lambda$)**:\n    The relationship between speed of sound, frequency, and wavelength is $c = f \\lambda$.\n    $$ \\lambda = \\frac{c}{f} = \\frac{1540\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}{7 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 220 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\n\n3.  **Calculate the array pitch ($d$)**:\n    The problem states that the pitch is one-half of the wavelength.\n    $$ d = \\frac{\\lambda}{2} = \\frac{220 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{2} = 110 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the inter-element time delay ($\\Delta t$)**:\n    Using the derived formula:\n    $$ \\Delta t = \\frac{d \\sin(\\theta)}{c} $$\n    Substituting the values:\n    $$ \\Delta t = \\frac{(110 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\sin(20^{\\circ})}{1540\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} $$\n    The value of $\\sin(20^{\\circ})$ is approximately $0.34202014$.\n    $$ \\Delta t \\approx \\frac{(110 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 0.34202014}{1540}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n    $$ \\Delta t \\approx \\frac{3.7622215 \\times 10^{-5}}{1540}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n    $$ \\Delta t \\approx 2.4430009 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n\n5.  **Express the answer in nanoseconds and round**:\n    The result must be expressed in nanoseconds ($1\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}$).\n    $$ \\Delta t \\approx 24.430009 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 24.430009\\,\\mathrm{ns} $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures gives:\n    $$ \\Delta t = 24.43\\,\\mathrm{ns} $$\nThe number of elements ($64$) is contextual information about the array but is not required for calculating the inter-element delay.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{24.43}$$", "id": "4477876"}, {"introduction": "Pulsed-wave Doppler is an indispensable tool for assessing blood flow, but it is constrained by a fundamental principle of signal processing: the Nyquist theorem.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe task is to compute two quantities: the ovarian volume in milliliters, and an indicator variable $I$ based on the criteria for polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM).\n\nFirst, we calculate the ovarian volume. The ovary is modeled as a tri-axial ellipsoid. The volume $V$ of an ellipsoid with semi-axes $a$, $b$, and $c$ is given by the formula:\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a b c$$\nThe problem provides the orthogonal diameters of the right ovary as length $L = 3.0$ centimeters, width $W = 2.4$ centimeters, and height $H = 2.5$ centimeters.
