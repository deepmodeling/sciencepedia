All necessary data are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe objective is to compute the new absolute volume of distribution ($V_d$) of a hydrophilic antibiotic at $28$ weeks of gestation.\n\nFirst, we must determine the baseline absolute volume of distribution in the nonpregnant state.

The drug is administered in doses of size $D$ at a constant dosing interval $\\tau$. For an immediate-release formulation, we assume instantaneous absorption and distribution. The concentration of the drug in the body, $C(t)$, after a single effective dose $D_{eff} = F \\cdot D$, where $F$ is the bioavailability, is given by:\n$$C(t) = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{V_d} \\exp(-k_e t)$$\nwhere $V_d$ is the volume of distribution and $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. The elimination rate constant is related to clearance ($CL$) and volume of distribution by $k_e = CL/V_d$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the relationship between steady-state trough concentration and dose**\n\nFor a multiple dosing regimen, at steady state, the concentration profile is periodic. Let $C_{ss,max}$ be the peak concentration and $C_{ss,min}$ be the trough concentration at steady state. The trough concentration occurs just before the administration of a new dose. The peak concentration occurs immediately after the dose is absorbed.\n\nThe relationship between peak and trough concentrations over a single dosing interval $\\tau$ is:\n$$C_{ss,min} = C_{ss,max} \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\nImmediately after a dose is administered and absorbed, the concentration increases by $\\frac{F \\cdot D}{V_d}$. Therefore, the new peak concentration is the sum of the preceding trough concentration and the concentration increase from the new dose:\n$$C_{ss,max} = C_{ss,min} + \\frac{F \\cdot D}{V_d}$$\nSubstituting the second equation into the first gives:\n$$C_{ss,min} = \\left(C_{ss,min} + \\frac{F \\cdot D}{V_d}\\right) \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\nWe can now solve for $C_{ss,min}$:\n$$C_{ss,min} = C_{ss,min} \\exp(-k_e \\tau) + \\frac{F \\cdot D}{V_d} \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\n$$C_{ss,min} - C_{ss,min} \\exp(-k_e \\tau) = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{V_d} \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\n$$C_{ss,min} \\left(1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)\\right) = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{V_d} \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\n$$C_{ss,min} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{V_d} \\frac{\\exp(-k_e \\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)}$$\nThis equation is the derived relationship. It shows that for a given patient (constant $F, V_d, k_e$) and a fixed dosing interval $\\tau$, the steady-state trough concentration $C_{ss,min}$ is directly proportional to the dose $D$.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the new maintenance dose**\n\nLet's define the parameters for the two states of the patient.\nThe pre-pregnancy state (subscript $0$):\n- Dose: $D_0 = 100$ mg\n- Dosing interval: $\\tau = 12$ hours\n- Clearance: $CL_0$\n- Elimination rate constant: $k_{e,0} = CL_0 / V_d$\n- Steady-state trough concentration:\n$$C_{ss,min,0} = \\frac{F \\cdot D_0}{V_d} \\frac{\\exp(-k_{e,0} \\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k_{e,0} \\tau)}$$\n\nThe second-trimester state (subscript $1$), on the same regimen:\n- Dose: $D_0 = 100$ mg\n- Dosing interval: $\\tau = 12$ hours\n- Clearance: $CL_1 = 2 \\cdot CL_0$ (doubled)\n- Elimination rate constant: $k_{e,1} = CL_1 / V_d = (2 \\cdot CL_0) / V_d = 2 \\cdot k_{e,0}$ (since $V_d$ is constant)\n- Measured steady-state trough concentration:\n$$C_{ss,min,1} = \\frac{F \\cdot D_0}{V_d} \\frac{\\exp(-k_{e,1} \\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k_{e,1} \\tau)} = \\frac{F \\cdot D_0}{V_d} \\frac{\\exp(-2k_{e,0} \\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-2k_{e,0} \\tau)}$$\n\nWe are given that the trough concentration falls by $60\\%$, which means $C_{ss,min,1} = (1 - 0.60) C_{ss,min,0} = 0.40 C_{ss,min,0}$. We can use this information to find the value of the term $\\exp(-k_{e,0} \\tau)$. Let's form the ratio $\\frac{C_{ss,min,1}}{C_{ss,min,0}}$:\n$$0.40 = \\frac{\\frac{F \\cdot D_0}{V_d} \\frac{\\exp(-2k_{e,0} \\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-2k_{e,0} \\tau)}}{\\frac{F \\cdot D_0}{V_d} \\frac{\\exp(-k_{e,0} \\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k_{e,0} \\tau)}}$$\nLet $x = \\exp(-k_{e,0} \\tau)$. The equation becomes:\n$$0.40 = \\frac{\\frac{x^2}{1 - x^2}}{\\frac{x}{1 - x}} = \\frac{x^2}{(1-x)(1+x)} \\cdot \\frac{1-x}{x} = \\frac{x}{1+x}$$\nSolving for $x$:\n$$0.40 (1+x) = x$$\n$$0.40 + 0.40x = x$$\n$$0.40 = 0.60x$$\n$$x = \\frac{0.40}{0.60} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nSo, we have determined that $\\exp(-k_{e,0} \\tau) = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nThe goal is to find a new dose, $D_{new}$, that restores the pre-pregnancy trough concentration ($C_{ss,min,0}$) during the second trimester, where the clearance is doubled ($k_{e,new} = k_{e,1} = 2k_{e,0}$). Let the target trough concentration be $C_{ss,min,target} = C_{ss,min,0}$.\nThe equation for the new state with the new dose is:\n$$C_{ss,min,target} = \\frac{F \\cdot D_{new}}{V_d} \\frac{\\exp(-k_{e,new} \\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k_{e,new} \\tau)}$$\nSubstituting $C_{ss,min,target} = C_{ss,min,0}$ and $k_{e,new} = 2k_{e,0}$:\n$$C_{ss,min,0} = \\frac{F \\cdot D_{new}}{V_d} \\frac{\\exp(-2k_{e,0} \\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-2k_{e,0} \\tau)}$$\nWe now have two expressions for $C_{ss,min,0}$:\n$$\\frac{F \\cdot D_0}{V_d} \\frac{\\exp(-k_{e,0} \\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k_{e,0} \\tau)} = \\frac{F \\cdot D_{new}}{V_d} \\frac{\\exp(-2k_{e,0} \\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-2k_{e,0} \\tau)}$$\nThe term $\\frac{F}{V_d}$ cancels out. We solve for $D_{new}$:\n$$D_{new} = D_0 \\cdot \\frac{\\exp(-k_{e,0} \\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k_{e,0} \\tau)} \\cdot \\frac{1 - \\exp(-2k_{e,0} \\tau)}{\\exp(-2k_{e,0} \\tau)}$$\nSubstituting $x = \\exp(-k_{e,0} \\tau)$:\n$$D_{new} = D_0 \\cdot \\frac{x}{1-x} \\cdot \\frac{1-x^2}{x^2} = D_0 \\cdot \\frac{x}{1-x} \\cdot \\frac{(1-x)(1+x)}{x^2} = D_0 \\cdot \\frac{1+x}{x}$$\nNow, we substitute the value we found for $x$: $x = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n$$D_{new} = D_0 \\cdot \\frac{1 + \\frac{2}{3}}{\\frac{2}{3}} = D_0 \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{5}{3}}{\\frac{2}{3}} = D_0 \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5 D_0$$\nThe pre-pregnancy maintenance dose was $D_0 = 100$ mg (per administration). The new required maintenance dose is:\n$$D_{new} = 2.5 \\times 100 \\text{ mg} = 250 \\text{ mg}$$\nThis is the dose per administration, given twice daily. The problem asks for the new total daily dose.\nTotal Daily Dose$_{new} = D_{new} \\times 2 = 250 \\text{ mg} \\times 2 = 500 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe result must be rounded to three significant figures. $500$ mg can be written as $5.00 \\times 10^2$ mg to explicitly show three significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.00 \\times 10^{2}}$$", "id": "4489100"}, {"introduction": "After delivery, the focus of perinatal pharmacology shifts to lactation and ensuring infant safety.

In an aqueous solution, it establishes an equilibrium with its conjugate acid, $BH^+$, according to the reaction:\n$$BH^+ \\rightleftharpoons B + H^+$$\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, for the conjugate acid $BH^+$ is given by:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[B][H^+]}{[BH^+]}$$\nwhere $[B]$ is the concentration of the unionized base, $[BH^+]$ is the concentration of the ionized conjugate acid, and $[H^+]$ is the proton concentration.\n\nTaking the negative base-$10$ logarithm of both sides yields the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation.\n$$-\\log_{10}(K_a) = -\\log_{10}([H^+]) - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B]}{[BH^+]}\\right)$$\nUsing the definitions $pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$ and $pH = -\\log_{10}([H^+])$, we have:\n$$pK_a = pH - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B]}{[BH^+]}\\right)$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express the ratio of the unionized to ionized species as a function of $pH$ and $pK_a$:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B]}{[BH^+]}\\right) = pH - pK_a$$\n$$\\frac{[B]}{[BH^+]} = 10^{pH - pK_a}$$\nLet $C_U$ denote the concentration of the unionized form ($[B]$) and $C_I$ denote the concentration of the ionized form ($[BH^+]$). The total concentration of the drug in a compartment, $C_{total}$, is the sum of these two forms:\n$$C_{total} = C_U + C_I$$\nFrom the rearranged Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we can express $C_I$ in terms of $C_U$:\n$$C_I = \\frac{C_U}{10^{pH - pK_a}} = C_U \\cdot 10^{-(pH - pK_a)} = C_U \\cdot 10^{pK_a - pH}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for total concentration gives:\n$$C_{total} = C_U + C_U \\cdot 10^{pK_a - pH} = C_U (1 + 10^{pK_a - pH})$$\nThis general relationship holds for any compartment at equilibrium.

At steady state, the concentration of this mobile species is equal on both sides of the membrane. Therefore:\n$$C_{U, \\mathrm{plasma}} = C_{U, \\mathrm{milk}}$$\nThe milk-to-plasma concentration ratio, denoted $M/P$, is the ratio of the total drug concentration in milk to that in plasma:\n$$M/P = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{total,milk}}}{C_{\\mathrm{total,plasma}}} = \\frac{C_{U, \\mathrm{milk}} (1 + 10^{pK_a - pH_{\\mathrm{milk}}})}{C_{U, \\mathrm{plasma}} (1 + 10^{pK_a - pH_{\\mathrm{plasma}}})}$$\nSince $C_{U, \\mathrm{plasma}} = C_{U, \\mathrm{milk}}$, these terms cancel, yielding the derived expression for the $M/P$ ratio when protein binding is negligible:\n$$M/P = \\frac{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH_{\\mathrm{milk}}}}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH_{\\mathrm{plasma}}}}$$\nThis phenomenon, where a drug accumulates in a compartment due to a $pH$ difference, is known as \"ion trapping\".\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for the given parameters: $pK_a = 9.4$, $pH_{\\mathrm{plasma}} = 7.4$, and $pH_{\\mathrm{milk}} = 7.0$.\n$$M/P = \\frac{1 + 10^{9.4 - 7.0}}{1 + 10^{9.4 - 7.4}} = \\frac{1 + 10^{2.4}}{1 + 10^{2.0}}$$\nCalculating the values of the powers of $10$:\n$$10^{2.0} = 100$$\n$$10^{2.4} \\approx 251.1886$$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $M/P$:\n$$M/P = \\frac{1 + 251.1886}{1 + 100} = \\frac{252.1886}{101} \\approx 2.496917$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the numerical value is $2.50$.\n\nNow, we extend the expression to include protein binding.

The total concentration in a compartment, $C_{total}$, is the sum of bound and unbound drug. The total unbound concentration, $C_u$, is related to the total concentration by $C_u = f_u \\cdot C_{total}$.\nThe equilibrium between ionized and unionized forms now applies to the unbound portion of the drug.
