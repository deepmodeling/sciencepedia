Express your answer as a decimal (do not use a percentage sign).", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data for a unique solution are provided. The problem is a standard application of conditional probability in the context of medical diagnostics. We will proceed to derive the solution from first principles.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has the specific gynecologic condition, and let $D^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have the condition. Let $T^+$ be the event that the screening test result is positive, and $T^-$ be the event that the result is negative.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are translated into probabilistic terms as follows:\n- The prevalence of the condition, $P(D)$, is $0.02$.\n- The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive test given the person has the disease, is $P(T^+ \\mid D) = 0.90$.\n- The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test given the person does not have the disease, is $P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 0.95$.\n\nOur objective is to calculate the positive predictive value (PPV), which is the probability that a patient has the condition given that she has received a positive test result. This corresponds to the conditional probability $P(D \\mid T^+)$.\n\nWe begin with the fundamental definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\nwhere $P(D \\cap T^+)$ is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive.\n\nFirst, we will find an expression for the numerator, $P(D \\cap T^+)$. We can use the definition of conditional probability for the sensitivity, $P(T^+ \\mid D)$:\n$$P(T^+ \\mid D) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\cap D)}{P(D)}$$\nRearranging this equation gives us an expression for the joint probability:\n$$P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid D) \\cdot P(D)$$\nThe values on the right-hand side are given as the sensitivity and the prevalence, respectively.\n\nNext, we will find an expression for the denominator, $P(T^+)$. This is the overall probability of receiving a positive test result. To find this, we apply the Law of Total Probability. The event $T^+$ can be partitioned into two mutually exclusive events: testing positive with the disease ($T^+ \\cap D$) and testing positive without the disease ($T^+ \\cap D^c$).\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nWe have already found an expression for the first term: $P(T^+ \\cap D) = P(T^+ \\mid D) \\cdot P(D)$.\nFor the second term, $P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$, we again use the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(T^+ \\cap D^c) = P(T^+ \\mid D^c) \\cdot P(D^c)$$\nTo evaluate this, we need $P(D^c)$ and $P(T^+ \\mid D^c)$.\n$P(D^c)$ is the probability of not having the disease, which is the complement of the prevalence:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D)$$\n$P(T^+ \\mid D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given the absence of disease. This is the false positive rate. We are given the specificity, $P(T^- \\mid D^c)$, which is the probability of a negative test in a disease-free individual. Since a test result can only be positive or negative, these are complementary events for a person in a given state of health. Therefore:\n$$P(T^+ \\mid D^c) + P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 1$$\n$$P(T^+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(T^- \\mid D^c)$$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $P(T^+)$, we get:\n$$P(T^+) = \\left( P(T^+ \\mid D) \\cdot P(D) \\right) + \\left( (1 - P(T^- \\mid D^c)) \\cdot (1 - P(D)) \\right)$$\n\nNow, we can assemble the complete analytical expression for the PPV, $P(D \\mid T^+)$, by substituting the expressions for the numerator and denominator:\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D) \\cdot P(D)}{P(T^+ \\mid D) \\cdot P(D) + P(T^+ \\mid D^c) \\cdot P(D^c)}$$\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D) \\cdot P(D)}{\\left( P(T^+ \\mid D) \\cdot P(D) \\right) + \\left( (1 - P(T^- \\mid D^c)) \\cdot (1 - P(D)) \\right)}$$\nThis expression is derived from first principles as required.\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $P(D) = 0.02$\n- $P(T^+ \\mid D) = 0.90$\n- $P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 0.95$\n\nFirst, calculate the necessary intermediate probabilities:\n- The probability of not having the disease: $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98$.\n- The false positive rate: $P(T^+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nNext, calculate the value of the numerator of the PPV expression. This is the probability of a true positive result in the population:\n$$P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid D) \\cdot P(D) = 0.90 \\times 0.02 = 0.018$$\n\nNext, calculate the value of the denominator. This is the total probability of a positive test:\n$$P(T^+) = P(D \\cap T^+) + P(D^c \\cap T^+)$$\nWe already have $P(D \\cap T^+) = 0.018$. The second term is the probability of a false positive result in the population:\n$$P(D^c \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid D^c) \\cdot P(D^c) = 0.05 \\times 0.98 = 0.049$$\nSo, the total probability of a positive test is:\n$$P(T^+) = 0.018 + 0.049 = 0.067$$\n\nFinally, we compute the positive predictive value:\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{0.018}{0.067}$$\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) \\approx 0.268656716...$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $0.2687$.\nThus, for a patient in this population who tests positive, the probability of actually having the condition is approximately $0.2687$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2687}$$", "id": "4500123"}, {"introduction": "Modern preventive guidelines are increasingly based on risk stratification, where clinical decisions are guided by a patient's quantified post-test risk.

The clinical context (cervical cancer screening), terminology (CIN2+, HPV testing, colposcopy), and values (pretest probability, LR+) are realistic and standard within the field of gynecology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary information to calculate a unique solution. It clearly defines the initial state (pretest probability), the new evidence (positive test result with its associated LR+), and the question (calculate the post-test probability and determine the subsequent management action based on a given threshold).\n- **Objective:** The language is clinical and quantitative, devoid of subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution process will proceed.\n\nThe solution requires calculating the post-test probability of CIN2+ given a positive HPV test, starting from the pre-test probability and the positive likelihood ratio. This is most elegantly achieved using the odds-likelihood ratio formulation of Bayes' theorem.\n\nFirst, we define the relationship between probability, $P$, and odds, $O$. The odds of an event are the ratio of the probability that the event will occur to the probability that it will not occur.\n$$O = \\frac{P}{1 - P}$$\nConversely, the probability can be derived from the odds:\n$$P = \\frac{O}{1 + O}$$\n\nThe pre-test probability of CIN2+, denoted as $P_{\\text{pre}}$, is given as $0.05$. We can calculate the pre-test odds, $O_{\\text{pre}}$, as follows:\n$$O_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{pre}}}{1 - P_{\\text{pre}}} = \\frac{0.05}{1 - 0.05} = \\frac{0.05}{0.95} = \\frac{5}{95} = \\frac{1}{19}$$\n\nBayes' theorem in its odds-likelihood form states that the post-test odds, $O_{\\text{post}}$, are the product of the pre-test odds and the likelihood ratio ($LR$). Since the test result is positive, we use the positive likelihood ratio, $LR+$.\n$$O_{\\text{post}} = O_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR+$$\nWe are given $LR+ = 10$. Substituting the values:\n$$O_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{1}{19} \\times 10 = \\frac{10}{19}$$\n\nNow, we convert the post-test odds back into a post-test probability, $P_{\\text{post}}$. This is the probability of CIN2+ given the positive test result.\n$$P_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{O_{\\text{post}}}{1 + O_{\\text{post}}} = \\frac{\\frac{10}{19}}{1 + \\frac{10}{19}} = \\frac{\\frac{10}{19}}{\\frac{19}{19} + \\frac{10}{19}} = \\frac{\\frac{10}{19}}{\\frac{29}{19}} = \\frac{10}{29}$$\n\nTo apply the clinic's management policy, we must express this probability as a decimal.\n$$P_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{10}{29} \\approx 0.344827586...$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final post-test probability to four significant figures.\n$$P_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.3448$$\n\nThe final step is to apply the clinic's risk-based management policy. The policy states that diagnostic colposcopy is recommended if the immediate post-test probability of CIN2+ is at least $0.20$.\nOur calculated post-test probability is $0.3448$.\nSince $0.3448 \\geq 0.20$, the condition for colposcopy is met.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate management action is to recommend a diagnostic colposcopy.
