Well-tested clinical literature reports normative ranges for the UCI at term as follows: hypocoiled if the UCI is less than $0.1$ coils per centimeter, normal if the UCI is between $0.1$ and $0.3$ coils per centimeter (inclusive), and hypercoiled if the UCI is greater than $0.3$ coils per centimeter. A technician records a total cord length of $60$ centimeters and counts $12$ complete coils from placental insertion to the fetal end.\n\nUsing the definitions above and no additional assumptions, compute the UCI and classify the coiling status relative to the normative ranges.

Umbilical arteries have higher pressure than the umbilical vein.\n- **Task:** Construct a single-threshold decision rule using a wall thickness-to-lumen size ratio to classify two profiles as arteries and one as a vein.\n- **Data for Profile $X$:** Lumen described by orthogonal diameters $D_1 = 1.4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $D_2 = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.

The data values are realistic.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe core principle is that umbilical arteries, operating at higher pressure, will have a larger wall thickness-to-lumen radius ratio ($\\dfrac{t}{r}$) than the umbilical vein. The task is to calculate this ratio for each profile and use it for classification. The problem specifies using an area-equivalent radius, $r_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, to normalize for elliptical cross-sections.\n\nFor an elliptical lumen with semi-axes $a$ and $b$, the area is $A = \\pi a b$. An equivalent circle with radius $r_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ has the same area, $A = \\pi r_{\\mathrm{eq}}^2$. Therefore, $r_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\sqrt{a b}$. The semi-axes are half the given diameters, $a = D_1/2$ and $b = D_2/2$. So, $r_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{D_1}{2} \\cdot \\dfrac{D_2}{2}} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{D_1 D_2}}{2}$. For a circular lumen with diameter $D$, the radius is $r = D/2$, which is also the area-equivalent radius.\n\nWe will calculate the ratio $R = \\dfrac{t}{r_{\\mathrm{eq}}}$ for each profile.\n\n**Profile $X$:**\n- Diameters: $D_1 = 1.4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $D_2 = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Area-equivalent radius: $r_{\\mathrm{eq},X} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{(1.4\\,\\mathrm{mm})(0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm})}}{2} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{1.12}\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2}{2} \\approx \\dfrac{1.0583\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{2} \\approx 0.52915\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Wall thickness: $t_X = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Ratio: $R_X = \\dfrac{t_X}{r_{\\mathrm{eq},X}} \\approx \\dfrac{0.35\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{0.52915\\,\\mathrm{mm}} \\approx 0.6614$.\n\n**Profile $Y$:**\n- Diameters: $D_1 = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $D_2 = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Area-equivalent radius: $r_{\\mathrm{eq},Y} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{(0.6\\,\\mathrm{mm})(0.4\\,\\mathrm{mm})}}{2} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{0.24}\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2}{2} \\approx \\dfrac{0.4899\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{2} \\approx 0.24495\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Wall thickness: $t_Y = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Ratio: $R_Y = \\dfrac{t_Y}{r_{\\mathrm{eq},Y}} \\approx \\dfrac{0.45\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{0.24495\\,\\mathrm{mm}} \\approx 1.8371$.\n\n**Profile $Z$:**\n- Diameter: $D = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Radius (which is also the area-equivalent radius): $r_{\\mathrm{eq},Z} = \\dfrac{D}{2} = \\dfrac{1.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{2} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Wall thickness: $t_Z = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Ratio: $R_Z = \\dfrac{t_Z}{r_{\\mathrm{eq},Z}} = \\dfrac{0.25\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = 0.3125$.\n\n**Ranking and Classification:**\nThe calculated ratios are:\n- $R_Y \\approx 1.837$\n- $R_X \\approx 0.661$\n- $R_Z \\approx 0.3125$\n\nOrdering them from highest to lowest: $R_Y > R_X > R_Z$.\nAccording to the biomechanical principle, the two profiles with the highest ratios are the arteries, and the one with the lowest ratio is the vein.\n- **Arteries:** Profiles $Y$ and $X$.\n- **Vein:** Profile $Z$.\n\nA single-threshold decision rule, $R > R^{\\star}$, should separate the arteries from the vein. The threshold $R^{\\star}$ must lie between the lowest artery ratio ($R_X \\approx 0.661$) and the vein ratio ($R_Z = 0.3125$). A robust choice for the threshold would be one that maximizes the separation margin, for instance, by lying in the middle of the gap: $R^{\\star} = \\dfrac{R_X + R_Z}{2} \\approx \\dfrac{0.6614 + 0.3125}{2} = \\dfrac{0.9739}{2} \\approx 0.487$. A value of $R^{\\star} \\approx 0.49$ is a well-justified choice.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Define $R = \\dfrac{t}{r_{\\mathrm{eq}}}$, with $r_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ the area-equivalent radius of each lumen. Choose a threshold $R^{\\star} \\approx 0.49$ (midway between the closest pair of observed ratios) to maximize separation margin. Classify $X$ and $Y$ as arteries and $Z$ as the vein.**\n- **Ratio Definition:** This uses the scientifically justified ratio $R = \\dfrac{t}{r_{\\mathrm{eq}}}$ as directed by the problem's reasoning. This is correct.\n- **Threshold Choice:** The threshold $R^{\\star} \\approx 0.49$ is a reasoned choice, falling in the gap between the artery group and the vein, specifically near the midpoint of the interval $[0.3125, 0.6614]$. This method maximizes the classification margin. This is correct.\n- **Classification:** The classification of $X$ and $Y$ as arteries and $Z$ as the vein matches our derived result. This is correct.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option accurately specifies the justified ratio, a robust threshold, and the correct final classification, consistent with all problem constraints and principles.\n\n**B. Define $R_D = \\dfrac{t}{D_{\\mathrm{mean}}}$, where $D_{\\mathrm{mean}}$ is the arithmetic mean of measured diameters for each lumen ($D_{\\mathrm{mean}} = \\dfrac{D_1 + D_2}{2}$ for elliptical profiles, $D_{\\mathrm{mean}} = D$ for circular). Use a threshold $R_D^{\\star} = 0.35$. Classify $Y$ as an artery and $X$ and $Z$ as veins.**\n- **Ratio Definition:** This ratio, $R_D = \\dfrac{t}{D_{\\mathrm{mean}}}$, is not what is suggested by the biomechanical principle ($\\sigma_{\\theta} \\propto \\dfrac{Pr}{t}$ which supports a $t/r$ ratio), nor does it adhere to the problem's instruction to use an area-equivalent radius.\n- **Classification:** Let's check the classification with this method.\n  - $R_{D,X} = \\dfrac{0.35}{(1.4+0.8)/2} = \\dfrac{0.35}{1.1} \\approx 0.318$.\n  - $R_{D,Y} = \\dfrac{0.45}{(0.6+0.4)/2} = \\dfrac{0.45}{0.5} = 0.9$.\n  - $R_{D,Z} = \\dfrac{0.25}{1.6} \\approx 0.156$.\n  - Using the threshold $R_D^{\\star} = 0.35$, only profile $Y$ is classified as an artery ($0.9 > 0.35$), while $X$ and $Z$ are classified as veins ($0.318 < 0.35$ and $0.156 < 0.35$). This classification of one artery and two veins contradicts the known anatomy of the umbilical cord (two arteries, one vein).\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The ratio definition is less justified than the one based on area equivalence, and the resulting classification is inconsistent with the problem's premise.\n\n**C. Define $R = \\dfrac{t}{r_{\\mathrm{eq}}}$ but choose a conservative threshold $R^{\\star} = 1.0$ to avoid false positives. Classify only $Y$ as an artery and $X$ and $Z$ as veins.**\n- **Ratio Definition:** This uses the correct ratio, $R = \\dfrac{t}{r_{\\mathrm{eq}}}$.\n- **Threshold Choice and Classification:** Using the calculated ratios ($R_Y \\approx 1.837$, $R_X \\approx 0.661$, $R_Z \\approx 0.3125$) and a threshold of $R^{\\star} = 1.0$, profile $Y$ would be classified as an artery, while profiles $X$ and $Z$ would be classified as veins. This again results in a classification of one artery and two veins, which is factually incorrect for the umbilical cord. The threshold, while perhaps \"conservative,\" is not functional as it fails to partition the data according to the known ground truth.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The threshold is poorly chosen, leading to a classification that contradicts the problem statement.\n\n**D. Use the largest-lumen criterion: identify the profile with the largest lumen ($Z$) as the vein and the other two profiles as arteries; ignore wall thickness-to-lumen ratios when deciding.**\n- **Method:** This option explicitly instructs to \"ignore wall thickness-to-lumen ratios\". This is a direct violation of the problem's central task, which is to \"Construct a single-threshold decision rule based on a wall thickness-to-lumen size ratio\". While a common heuristic is that arteries are smaller and thicker-walled than their accompanying veins, and this heuristic would lead to the correct classification here (Lumen area of $Z$ is $\\pi(0.8)^2 = 0.64\\pi \\approx 2.01\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$, largest of the three), the method discards the scientific principle and methodology requested.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biomechanics, specifically the Law of Laplace for cylindrical vessels. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and clear objectives. The given values for pressure and radius are physiologically plausible for an umbilical artery.\n\nThe problem asks for three components: first, a derivation of the circumferential wall tension from first principles; second, a numerical calculation of this tension for given parameters; and third, a qualitative explanation of the relationship between wall thickness and wall stress.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Circumferential Wall Tension ($T$)**\n\nWe model a segment of the umbilical artery as a thin-walled cylinder of length $L$ and internal radius $r$. The transmural pressure $P$ is the pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the vessel, which acts to expand the vessel. We analyze the forces acting on a longitudinally bisected half of this cylindrical segment, assuming the system is in static mechanical equilibrium.\n\nTwo main forces are at play:\n1.  An outward-directed force, $F_P$, resulting from the transmural pressure $P$ acting on the internal surfaces. For a force balance, we consider the projection of this pressure onto the plane of a bisection. The projected area is a rectangle with dimensions of the cylinder's diameter ($2r$) and its length ($L$). The total force pushing the two halves of the cylinder apart is therefore the pressure multiplied by this projected area:\n    $$F_P = P \\times (2rL)$$\n\n2.  A restraining inward-directed force, $F_T$, arising from the circumferential tension in the artery wall. Tension, $T$, is defined as force per unit length. This tension acts along the two cut edges of the wall material. Each cut edge has a length $L$. The total restraining force, which holds the cylinder together, is the tension $T$ multiplied by the total length of the two edges:\n    $$F_T = T \\times (2L)$$\n\nFor the vessel to be in static equilibrium, these two opposing forces must be equal:\n$$F_P = F_T$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $F_P$ and $F_T$:\n$$P(2rL) = T(2L)$$\nThe terms $2$ and $L$ are present on both sides of the equation and can be canceled, provided $L \\neq 0$. This simplification yields the relationship between tension, pressure, and radius:\n$$T = Pr$$\nThis is the Law of Laplace for a thin-walled cylinder. It states that the circumferential wall tension $T$ (force per unit length) is the product of the transmural pressure $P$ and the luminal radius $r$.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation of Tension**\n\nWe are given the following values:\nTransmural pressure, $P = 60\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$\nLuminal radius, $r = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\nConversion factor, $1\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} = 133.322\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n\nTo calculate the tension in SI units ($\\mathrm{N/m}$), we must first convert the given values to base SI units.\nPressure conversion from $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ to Pascals ($\\mathrm{Pa}$ or $\\mathrm{N/m^2}$):\n$$P = 60\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} \\times \\frac{133.322\\,\\mathrm{Pa}}{1\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}} = 7999.32\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 7999.32\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}$$\nRadius conversion from millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$) to meters ($\\mathrm{m}$):\n$$r = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived formula $T = Pr$:\n$$T = (7999.32\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}) \\times (1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})$$\n$$T = 11.99898\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$T \\approx 12.0\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$$\n\n**Part 3: Qualitative Explanation of Wall Stress**\n\nCircumferential wall tension, $T$, is the force acting per unit *length* of the vessel wall. In contrast, circumferential wall stress, $\\sigma$, is the force acting per unit *cross-sectional area* of the wall material. Let the thickness of the arterial wall (the media and other layers) be denoted by $h$.\n\nThe force that the wall material must withstand is carried by a cross-sectional area of $h \\times L$ along each cut edge. The total force is $F_T = 2TL$. The total area supporting this force is $2hL$. The stress is this force divided by the area over which it acts. A simpler way to view this is to relate stress $\\sigma$ to tension $T$. The tension $T$ (force per unit length) is distributed over the wall thickness $h$.\nTherefore, the average circumferential wall stress $\\sigma$ is given by:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{T}{h}$$\nSubstituting our derived result for tension, $T = Pr$, into this equation gives:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{Pr}{h}$$\nThis final relationship shows that for a constant transmural pressure $P$ and luminal radius $r$, the circumferential wall stress $\\sigma$ is inversely proportional to the wall thickness $h$. A thicker arterial media means a larger value for $h$. Consequently, a larger $h$ leads to a smaller value for $\\sigma$. This mechanical principle explains how a robust, thick wall allows an artery to withstand high internal pressure; the force is distributed over a larger area of tissue, reducing the stress experienced by the tissue's constituent cells and extracellular matrix, thereby lowering the risk of mechanical failure or rupture. The thick layer of Wharton's jelly surrounding the umbilical vessels also provides external mechanical support, which helps reduce the effective transmural pressure and further limits vessel distension, contributing to the overall stability.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{12.0}\n$$", "id": "4519697"}]}
