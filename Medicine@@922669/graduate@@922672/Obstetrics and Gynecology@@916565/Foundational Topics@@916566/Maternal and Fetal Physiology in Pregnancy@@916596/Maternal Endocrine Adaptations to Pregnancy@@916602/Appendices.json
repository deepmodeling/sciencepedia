In early pregnancy, Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) maintains corpus luteum progesterone production until the placenta increasingly assumes steroidogenesis. Consider the following scientifically grounded facts: progesterone in maternal plasma follows well-approximated linear clearance kinetics; at a pharmacokinetic steady state, total production equals elimination; the systemic metabolic clearance rate of progesterone (denoted $\\mathrm{CL}_{\\text{prog}}$) is unchanged by luteectomy; and placental production is not acutely altered by luteectomy.\n\nAssume steady-state concentrations have been measured as follows: at gestational week $7$, the maternal serum progesterone concentration is $C_{7} = 40\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$; at gestational week $12$, the concentration is $C_{12} = 60\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$.

The solution is based on the pharmacokinetic principle of steady state, where the rate of production of a substance equals its rate of elimination.\n\nLet $C$ be the steady-state concentration of progesterone in maternal serum. According to the principle of linear clearance kinetics, the rate of elimination ($R_{\\text{elim}}$) is the product of the systemic metabolic clearance rate ($\\mathrm{CL}_{\\text{prog}}$) and the concentration $C$.\n$$R_{\\text{elim}} = \\mathrm{CL}_{\\text{prog}} \\times C$$\nAt steady state, the total production rate ($P_{\\text{total}}$) must equal the elimination rate.\n$$P_{\\text{total}} = R_{\\text{elim}} = \\mathrm{CL}_{\\text{prog}} \\times C$$\nThe total production of progesterone is the sum of the production from the corpus luteum ($P_{\\text{CL}}$) and the placenta ($P_{\\text{placenta}}$).\n$$P_{\\text{total}} = P_{\\text{CL}} + P_{\\text{placenta}}$$\nThe problem provides the fractional contribution of the corpus luteum to total production, denoted as $f_{\\text{CL}}$. This can be expressed as:\n$$f_{\\text{CL}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{CL}}}{P_{\\text{total}}}$$\nFrom this, we can express the production rates of the corpus luteum and the placenta in terms of the total production rate:\n$$P_{\\text{CL}} = f_{\\text{CL}} \\times P_{\\text{total}}$$\n$$P_{\\text{placenta}} = P_{\\text{total}} - P_{\\text{CL}} = (1 - f_{\\text{CL}}) \\times P_{\\text{total}}$$\nSubstituting $P_{\\text{total}} = \\mathrm{CL}_{\\text{prog}} \\times C$, we get:\n$$P_{\\text{placenta}} = (1 - f_{\\text{CL}}) \\times (\\mathrm{CL}_{\\text{prog}} \\times C)$$\nA luteectomy involves the surgical removal of the corpus luteum, which means its contribution to progesterone production becomes zero. The problem states that placental production is not acutely altered by this procedure. Therefore, the new total production rate, $P'_{\\text{total}}$, is equal to the original placental production rate.\n$$P'_{\\text{total}} = P_{\\text{placenta}}$$\nLet the new steady-state progesterone concentration after the luteectomy be $C'$. The clearance rate, $\\mathrm{CL}_{\\text{prog}}$, is assumed to be unchanged. The new steady-state condition is:\n$$P'_{\\text{total}} = \\mathrm{CL}_{\\text{prog}} \\times C'$$\nWe can now solve for $C'$ by substituting the expressions for $P'_{\\text{total}}$ and $P_{\\text{placenta}}$:\n$$C' = \\frac{P'_{\\text{total}}}{\\mathrm{CL}_{\\text{prog}}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{placenta}}}{\\mathrm{CL}_{\\text{prog}}} = \\frac{(1 - f_{\\text{CL}}) \\times (\\mathrm{CL}_{\\text{prog}} \\times C)}{\\mathrm{CL}_{\\text{prog}}}$$\nThe term $\\mathrm{CL}_{\\text{prog}}$ cancels out, which is expected as the problem does not provide its value. This yields a direct relationship between the old and new concentrations:\n$$C' = (1 - f_{\\text{CL}}) \\times C$$\nThe problem asks for the decrease in serum progesterone concentration, which we define as $\\Delta C = C - C'$.\n$$\\Delta C = C - \\left( (1 - f_{\\text{CL}}) \\times C \\right) = C \\times (1 - (1 - f_{\\text{CL}})) = C \\times (1 - 1 + f_{\\text{CL}})$$\n$$\\Delta C = C \\times f_{\\text{CL}}$$\nThis elegant result shows that the decrease in concentration is simply the initial concentration multiplied by the fractional contribution of the removed source.
