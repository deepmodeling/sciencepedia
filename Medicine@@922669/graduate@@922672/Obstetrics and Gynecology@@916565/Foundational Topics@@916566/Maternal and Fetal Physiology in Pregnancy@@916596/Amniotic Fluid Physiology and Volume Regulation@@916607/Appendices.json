The net rate of change of the amniotic fluid volume, $\\frac{dV}{dt}$, is the sum of all volume inflows minus the sum of all volume outflows.\n\nThe inflows into the amniotic cavity are fetal urine production, with rate $r_{u}$, and fetal lung fluid secretion, with rate $r_{\\ell}$. The total inflow rate, $r_{\\text{in}}$, is:\n$$r_{\\text{in}} = r_{u} + r_{\\ell}$$\n\nThe outflows from the amniotic cavity are fetal swallowing, with rate $r_{s}$, and intramembranous absorption (IMA), with rate $r_{i}$. The total outflow rate, $r_{\\text{out}}$, is:\n$$r_{\\text{out}} = r_{s} + r_{i}$$\n\nThe net rate of change of amniotic fluid volume is therefore:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dt} = r_{\\text{in}} - r_{\\text{out}} = (r_{u} + r_{\\ell}) - (r_{s} + r_{i})$$\n\nSince the rates are assumed to be constant over the time interval $T$, the total change in volume, $\\Delta V$, is the net rate multiplied by the duration of the interval:\n$$\\Delta V = \\left( \\frac{dV}{dt} \\right) \\times T$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $r_{u} = 32 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, hr^{-1}}$\n- $r_{\\ell} = 5.2 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, hr^{-1}}$\n- $r_{s} = 18.7 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, hr^{-1}}$\n- $r_{i} = 14.9 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, hr^{-1}}$\n- $T = 24 \\ \\mathrm{hr}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the net rate of change, $\\frac{dV}{dt}$:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dt} = (32 + 5.2) \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, hr^{-1}} - (18.7 + 14.9) \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, hr^{-1}}$$\n$$r_{\\text{in}} = 37.2 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, hr^{-1}}$$\n$$r_{\\text{out}} = 33.6 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, hr^{-1}}$$\n$$\\frac{dV}{dt} = 37.2 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, hr^{-1}} - 33.6 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, hr^{-1}} = 3.6 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, hr^{-1}}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total volume change, $\\Delta V$, over the $T = 24 \\ \\mathrm{hr}$ period:\n$$\\Delta V = (3.6 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, hr^{-1}}) \\times (24 \\ \\mathrm{hr})$$\n$$\\Delta V = 86.4 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThe question asks for the net daily change in amniotic fluid volume in units of $\\mathrm{mL \\, day^{-1}}$.

Consider two compartments: the amniotic fluid (indexed by subscript $a$) and the fetal capillary blood space (indexed by subscript $f$). Let the driving forces for transmembrane water movement be the hydrostatic pressure difference and the oncotic pressure difference arising from largely protein macromolecules that are only partially reflected by the membrane. Assume linear, near-equilibrium transport behavior, constant temperature, negligible electrical effects, and that the given oncotic pressures already account for temperature and solute composition. Adopt the sign convention that a positive net volume flux per unit area $J_v$ denotes water transfer from the amniotic cavity toward the fetal capillary blood.\n\nStarting from the principles of conservation of mass and the phenomenological linear relations for solvent flow across a semipermeable membrane that incorporate hydrostatic pressure and oncotic pressure as thermodynamic driving forces with a solute reflection factor, derive an expression for $J_v$ as a function of the hydraulic conductivity per unit area $L_p$, the hydrostatic pressures $P_a$ and $P_f$, the oncotic pressures $\\pi_a$ and $\\pi_f$, and the dimensionless reflection coefficient $\\sigma$.\n\nThen, using the following physiologically plausible measurements in a near-term pregnancy:\n- Hydraulic conductivity per unit area $L_p = 0.020 \\, \\mathrm{mL} \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$,\n- Amniotic cavity hydrostatic pressure $P_a = 2$ mmHg,\n- Fetal capillary hydrostatic pressure $P_f = 12$ mmHg,\n- Amniotic fluid oncotic pressure $\\pi_a = 0.5$ mmHg,\n- Fetal plasma oncotic pressure $\\pi_f = 18$ mmHg,\n- Protein reflection coefficient of the amnion $\\sigma = 0.90$,\n\ncompute the numerical value of $J_v$ under these conditions.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of physiological transport phenomena, specifically the Starling equation for fluid flux across a semipermeable membrane. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective. The data are physiologically plausible, and the language is objective and unambiguous. It is a standard problem in biophysics and physiology.\n\nThe movement of solvent (water) across a semipermeable membrane, such as the amniotic membrane, is driven by differences in hydrostatic and oncotic pressures. This process is described by the Starling equation, a phenomenological linear relation. The net volume flux per unit area of the membrane, $J_v$, is proportional to the net driving pressure across the membrane. The proportionality constant is the hydraulic conductivity per unit area, $L_p$.\n\nThe driving pressure is a combination of the hydrostatic pressure gradient, $\\Delta P = P_a - P_f$, and the effective oncotic pressure gradient. Oncotic pressure is the osmotic pressure generated by large molecules like proteins. The membrane is partially permeable to these solutes, a property quantified by the dimensionless reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$. A value of $\\sigma=1$ implies the membrane is impermeable to the solute, and $\\sigma=0$ implies it is fully permeable. The effective oncotic pressure gradient that drives water flow is therefore $\\sigma (\\pi_f - \\pi_a)$.\n\nThe total net driving pressure is the sum of the hydrostatic pressure difference and the effective oncotic pressure difference. We must carefully adhere to the sign convention stated in the problem: a positive $J_v$ corresponds to water movement from the amniotic cavity (compartment $a$) to the fetal capillary blood (compartment $f$).\n\nLet's analyze the contribution of each pressure term to the flux from $a$ to $f$:\n1.  A higher hydrostatic pressure in the amniotic cavity, $P_a$, relative to the fetal capillary, $P_f$, will push water from $a$ to $f$. Thus, the hydrostatic contribution is proportional to $(P_a - P_f)$.\n2.  A higher oncotic pressure in the fetal capillary, $\\pi_f$, relative to the amniotic cavity, $\\pi_a$, will pull water from $a$ to $f$. Thus, the oncotic contribution is proportional to $(\\pi_f - \\pi_a)$. This contribution is modulated by the reflection coefficient $\\sigma$.\n\nCombining these factors, the net driving pressure for flow from $a$ to $f$ is $(P_a - P_f) + \\sigma(\\pi_f - \\pi_a)$.\n\nThe full expression for the volume flux per unit area, $J_v$, is therefore:\n$$J_v = L_p \\left[ (P_a - P_f) + \\sigma (\\pi_f - \\pi_a) \\right]$$\nThis is the derived expression for $J_v$ based on the given principles and sign convention.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $J_v$ using the provided physiological data:\n- Hydraulic conductivity per unit area, $L_p = 0.020 \\, \\mathrm{mL} \\, \\mathrm{min}^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$\n- Amniotic cavity hydrostatic pressure, $P_a = 2 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- Fetal capillary hydrostatic pressure, $P_f = 12 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- Amniotic fluid oncotic pressure, $\\pi_a = 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- Fetal plasma oncotic pressure, $\\pi_f = 18 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- Protein reflection coefficient, $\\sigma = 0.90$\n\nFirst, we calculate the pressure differences:\nThe hydrostatic pressure difference is:\n$$ \\Delta P = P_a - P_f = 2 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} - 12 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} = -10 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} $$\nThe oncotic pressure difference is:\n$$ \\Delta \\pi = \\pi_f - \\pi_a = 18 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} - 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} = 17.5 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} $$\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the derived equation for $J_v$:\n$$ J_v = 0.020 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{min} \\cdot \\mathrm{mmHg} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2} \\left[ (-10 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}) + 0.90 \\times (17.5 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}) \\right] $$\nCalculate the term within the brackets, which represents the net driving pressure:\n$$ \\text{Net Driving Pressure} = -10 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} + 15.75 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} = 5.75 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} $$\nNow, calculate the final value for $J_v$:\n$$ J_v = 0.020 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{min} \\cdot \\mathrm{mmHg} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2} \\times 5.75 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg} $$\n$$ J_v = 0.115 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{min} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. The calculated value $0.115$ already has $3$ significant figures.\n\nFinally, we determine the direction of water transfer. The calculated value of $J_v$ is positive ($J_v = 0.115 > 0$). According to the problem's sign convention, a positive $J_v$ signifies water transfer from the amniotic cavity toward the fetal capillary blood.
