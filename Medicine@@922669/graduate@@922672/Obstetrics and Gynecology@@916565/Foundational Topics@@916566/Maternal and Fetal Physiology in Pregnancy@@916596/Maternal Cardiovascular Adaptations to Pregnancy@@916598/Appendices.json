Therefore, it is deemed valid.\n\nThe core principle for this problem is the definition of cardiac output ($CO$), which is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per unit time. This is a direct application of conservation-of-flow reasoning. Cardiac output is determined by the product of the heart rate ($HR$), which is the number of contractions (beats) per unit time, and the stroke volume ($SV$), which is the volume of blood ejected from a ventricle with each contraction.\n\nThe governing equation is:\n$$CO = HR \\times SV$$\n\nWe are given the patient's physiological parameters for two states: the nonpregnant baseline state (subscript $b$) and the current pregnant state at $26$ weeks of gestation (subscript $p$).\n\nThe given values for the baseline state are:\n- Baseline heart rate, $HR_b = 70 \\text{ beats/minute}$\n- Baseline stroke volume, $SV_b = 65 \\text{ mL/beat}$\n\nThe given values for the current pregnant state are:\n- Current heart rate, $HR_p = 95 \\text{ beats/minute}$\n- Current stroke volume, $SV_p = 75 \\text{ mL/beat}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the baseline cardiac output, $CO_b$, using the provided nonpregnant values:\n$$CO_b = HR_b \\times SV_b = (70 \\text{ min}^{-1}) \\times (65 \\text{ mL}) = 4550 \\text{ mL/min}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the current cardiac output, $CO_p$, using the measured values during pregnancy:\n$$CO_p = HR_p \\times SV_p = (95 \\text{ min}^{-1}) \\times (75 \\text{ mL}) = 7125 \\text{ mL/min}$$\n\nThe problem requires calculating the patient's current cardiac output relative to her baseline.

A relative increase of $0.3$ to $0.5$ corresponds to a ratio of current $CO_p$ to baseline $CO_b$ in the range of $[1.0 + 0.3, 1.0 + 0.5]$, which is $[1.3, 1.5]$.\n\nOur calculated ratio is $R \\approx 1.57$. This value is slightly above the upper limit of the typical physiological range ($1.5$) provided for the mid-second trimester. However, physiological parameters exhibit significant inter-individual variability. A value of $1.57$ is very close to the upper bound of the expected range and represents an increase of $57\\%$, which is a plausible, albeit high-normal, cardiovascular adaptation to pregnancy for this individual.

The given physiological values for baseline cardiac output ($CO$) and systemic vascular resistance ($SVR$) are within a normal range for a healthy human. The described changes—an increase in $CO$ and a decrease in $SVR$—are the canonical cardiovascular adaptations to pregnancy. The problem is based on the fundamental hemodynamic relationship, analogous to Ohm's law, which is a core principle in physiology. The setup is complete, coherent, and allows for a unique solution. The problem is valid.\n\nThe fundamental relationship linking perfusion pressure, flow, and resistance in the systemic circulation is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta P = Q \\times R\n$$\nIn this context, the perfusion pressure, $\\Delta P$, is the difference between the mean arterial pressure ($MAP$) and the central venous pressure, which is typically represented by the right atrial pressure ($RAP$). The flow, $Q$, is the cardiac output ($CO$), and the resistance, $R$, is the systemic vascular resistance ($SVR$). Thus, the equation is:\n$$\nMAP - RAP = CO \\times SVR\n$$\nThe problem states that the right atrial pressure ($RAP$) can be neglected.

This clinical scenario asks you to apply your knowledge to a case of postpartum hemorrhage, a leading cause of maternal mortality.

Acute hemorrhage lowers stroke volume $SV$ and triggers sympathetic activation, increasing $HR$ and variably affecting $SVR$. Systolic blood pressure $SBP$ is often initially preserved by compensatory vasoconstriction but will fall as shock progresses. The Shock Index (SI) is a validated, dimensionless triage metric defined as the ratio of heart rate to systolic blood pressure, $$SI = \\frac{HR}{SBP},$$ which amplifies early concurrent tachycardia and systolic hypotension and thus serves as a sensitive indicator of circulatory compromise.\n\nPregnancy-specific physiology modifies baseline values: compared with the nonpregnant state, late gestation is characterized by increased plasma volume, increased $HR$ by approximately $10$–$20$ beats per minute, reduced systemic vascular resistance, and a slight decrease in $SBP$; consequently, the resting obstetric shock index (often termed the obstetric shock index) tends to be modestly higher than in nonpregnant adults and typically lies around $0.7$ to $0.9$ in healthy late pregnancy at rest.\n\nFor the patient here, the calculation is direct from the definition:\nGiven $HR = 120$ and $SBP = 100$, \n$$SI = \\frac{HR}{SBP} = \\frac{120}{100} = 1.2.$$\n\nRounding to three significant figures yields $1.20$.\n\nInterpretation in the obstetric context: A value near $SI \\approx 0.7$–$0.9$ is expected at rest in late pregnancy. Values $\\geq 1.0$ are associated with clinically significant hypovolemia and a higher risk of decompensation in obstetric hemorrhage.
