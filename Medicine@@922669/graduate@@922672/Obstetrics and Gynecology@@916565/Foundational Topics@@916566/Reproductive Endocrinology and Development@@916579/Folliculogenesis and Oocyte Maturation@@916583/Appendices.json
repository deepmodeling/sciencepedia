It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and objective. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe problem describes the attrition of the primordial follicle pool, $N(t)$, as a memoryless process with a constant instantaneous hazard of atresia, $r$. This is the definition of a first-order decay process. The instantaneous rate of change of the follicle pool, $\\frac{dN}{dt}$, is proportional to the current size of the pool, $N(t)$. The constant of proportionality is the negative of the hazard rate, $-r$. This relationship is expressed as a first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -r N(t)\n$$\nThis equation is subject to the initial condition that the expected pool at birth (age $t=0$) is $N(0) = N_0$.\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N(t)} dN = -r dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides, we have:\n$$\n\\int_{N_0}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N'} dN' = \\int_{0}^{t} -r dt'\n$$\nThe left side integrates to the natural logarithm:\n$$\n[\\ln|N'|]_{N_0}^{N(t)} = \\ln|N(t)| - \\ln|N_0| = \\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right)\n$$\nSince the number of follicles $N(t)$ must be non-negative, we can drop the absolute value signs. The right side integrates to:\n$$\n[-r t']_{0}^{t} = -r t - (-r \\cdot 0) = -r t\n$$\nEquating the two results gives:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = -r t\n$$\nTo solve for $N(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{N(t)}{N_0} = \\exp(-rt)\n$$\nThis yields the expression for the expected number of primordial follicles at age $t$:\n$$\nN(t) = N_0 \\exp(-rt)\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for $N(t)$ in terms of $N_0$, $r$, and $t$.\n\nNext, we are asked to compute the expected primordial pool size at age $t = 32$ years, given the initial pool size $N_0 = 1.8 \\times 10^{6}$ follicles and the atresia rate $r = 0.075 \\,\\text{year}^{-1}$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\nN(32) = (1.8 \\times 10^{6}) \\exp(-0.075 \\times 32)\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the exponent:\n$$\n-0.075 \\times 32 = -2.4\n$$\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$\nN(32) = 1.8 \\times 10^{6} \\exp(-2.4)\n$$\nUsing a calculator for the exponential term:\n$$\n\\exp(-2.4) \\approx 0.09071795\n$$\nNow, we compute the final value for $N(32)$:\n$$\nN(32) \\approx 1.8 \\times 10^{6} \\times 0.09071795 \\approx 163292.31\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

An expected primordial follicle pool of approximately $1.633 \\times 10^5$ at age $32$ is considered to be a healthy and normal ovarian reserve. This value represents the total stock of non-growing follicles from which future oocytes will be recruited. Clinically, this underlying primordial pool is not directly measurable. Instead, its size is indirectly assessed through biomarkers like Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) and sonographic markers like the Antral Follicle Count (AFC).\n\nAMH is secreted primarily by the granulosa cells of pre-antral and small antral follicles, which represent the cohort of follicles that have recently been recruited from the primordial pool to begin growth. AFC is a direct count of the antral follicles ($2-10$ mm in diameter) visible via ultrasound during the early follicular phase of a menstrual cycle.\n\nThe relationship between the primordial pool size and these clinical markers is correlational, not linear. A larger primordial pool ($N(t)$) can support the recruitment and maintenance of a larger cohort of growing follicles. Consequently, a higher primordial follicle count is expected to correlate with a higher number of small antral follicles, which in turn leads to higher serum AMH levels and a higher AFC. Therefore, a calculated pool size of $1.633 \\times 10^5$ follicles at age $32$ would predict AMH and AFC values well within the normal range for this age, indicating robust ovarian reserve. This suggests that the dynamics of folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation are proceeding normally, with a sufficient supply of oocytes for continued fertility for several more years. Conversely, a significantly lower primordial pool size would manifest as diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), characterized by low AMH and low AFC.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.633 \\times 10^{5}}\n$$", "id": "4442626"}, {"introduction": "The journey of a single ovarian follicle from its dormant primordial state to a large, preovulatory structure is a complex, multi-stage process spanning several months.

It is convenient to work with concentrations in $\\mu$M and note that $1 \\, \\mu\\text{M} = 1$ nmol/mL. All rates are in nmol/min.\nThe coefficients of the quadratic equation are:\n$a = k_{\\mathrm{out}} V_f = (0.2 \\, \\text{min}^{-1})(5.0 \\, \\text{mL}) = 1.0 \\, \\text{mL/min}$.\n$b = V_{max,\\mathrm{arom}} + k_{\\mathrm{out}} V_f K_{m,\\mathrm{arom}} - v_T = 0.25 \\, \\frac{\\text{nmol}}{\\text{min}} + (1.0 \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}})(0.25 \\, \\mu\\text{M}) - \\frac{6.4}{11} \\, \\frac{\\text{nmol}}{\\text{min}}$. Since $1 \\, (\\text{mL/min}) \\times (\\mu \\text{M}) = 1 \\, (\\text{mL/min}) \\times (\\text{nmol/mL}) = 1 \\, (\\text{nmol/min})$, the units are consistent.\n$b = 0.25 + 0.25 - \\frac{6.4}{11} = 0.5 - \\frac{6.4}{11} = \\frac{5.5 - 6.4}{11} = -\\frac{0.9}{11} \\, \\frac{\\text{nmol}}{\\text{min}}$.\n$c = -v_T K_{m,\\mathrm{arom}} = -(\\frac{6.4}{11} \\, \\frac{\\text{nmol}}{\\text{min}})(0.25 \\, \\mu\\text{M}) = -\\frac{1.6}{11} \\, \\frac{\\text{nmol}}{\\text{min}}\\cdot\\mu\\text{M}$.\n\nThe quadratic equation for $A = [A]_{ss}$ (in $\\mu$M) is:\n$$ (1.0) A^2 - \\frac{0.9}{11} A - \\frac{1.6}{11} = 0 $$\nUsing the quadratic formula $A = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ and selecting the positive root for concentration:\n$$ A = \\frac{\\frac{0.9}{11} + \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{0.9}{11}\\right)^2 - 4(1.0)\\left(-\\frac{1.6}{11}\\right)}}{2(1.0)} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{0.9}{11} + \\sqrt{\\frac{0.81}{121} + \\frac{6.4 \\cdot 11}{121}}\\right) $$\n$$ A = \\frac{1}{22}\\left(0.9 + \\sqrt{0.81 + 70.4}\\right) = \\frac{0.9 + \\sqrt{71.21}}{22} \\, \\mu\\text{M} $$\n$$ [A]_{ss} \\approx \\frac{0.9 + 8.43860}{22} \\approx 0.42448 \\, \\mu\\text{M} $$\n\nNow, we establish the mass balance for estradiol ($E2$) at steady state.\n$$ \\frac{dN_{E2}}{dt} = (\\text{rate of production}) - (\\text{rate of removal}) = 0 $$\nProduction is via aromatase, $v_{\\mathrm{arom}}$, and removal is via first-order clearance, $k_{E2} N_{E2} = k_{E2} [E2]_{ss} V_f$.\n$$ 0 = V_{max,\\mathrm{arom}} \\frac{[A]_{ss}}{K_{m,\\mathrm{arom}} + [A]_{ss}} - k_{E2} [E2]_{ss} V_f $$\nSolving for $[E2]_{ss}$:\n$$ [E2]_{ss} = \\frac{1}{k_{E2} V_f} \\left( V_{max,\\mathrm{arom}} \\frac{[A]_{ss}}{K_{m,\\mathrm{arom}} + [A]_{ss}} \\right) $$\nSubstitute the numerical values:\n$$ [E2]_{ss} = \\frac{1}{(0.3 \\, \\text{min}^{-1})(5.0 \\, \\text{mL})} \\left( (0.25 \\, \\frac{\\text{nmol}}{\\text{min}}) \\frac{0.42448 \\, \\mu\\text{M}}{0.25 \\, \\mu\\text{M} + 0.42448 \\, \\mu\\text{M}} \\right) $$\n$$ [E2]_{ss} = \\frac{1}{1.5 \\, \\text{mL/min}} \\left( (0.25 \\, \\frac{\\text{nmol}}{\\text{min}}) \\frac{0.42448}{0.67448} \\right) $$\n$$ [E2]_{ss} \\approx \\frac{0.25}{1.5} \\left( 0.62934 \\right) \\, \\frac{\\text{nmol}}{\\text{mL}} $$\nSince $1$ nmol/mL = $1$ $\\mu$M, the concentration is:\n$$ [E2]_{ss} \\approx 0.16667 \\times 0.62934 \\, \\mu\\text{M} \\approx 0.10489 \\, \\mu\\text{M} $$\nThe problem asks for the concentration in nM.
