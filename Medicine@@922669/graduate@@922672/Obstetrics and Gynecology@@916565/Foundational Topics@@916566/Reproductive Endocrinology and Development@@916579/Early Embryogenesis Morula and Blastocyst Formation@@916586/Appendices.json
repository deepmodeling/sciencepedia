There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n- **Conclusion:** The problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains the necessary information to derive a solution from first principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n- **Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n- **Action:** Proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe formation of the blastocoel, a process known as cavitation, is driven by the accumulation of fluid within the center of the morula. This process can be understood by applying the provided principles.\n\n1.  **Establishment of a Sealed Epithelium:** At the compacted morula stage, the outer cells, which form the trophectoderm (TE), establish apical-basal polarity and form tight junctions (TJs). These TJs create a seal, separating the inner environment of the embryo from the external medium. This is a prerequisite for accumulating fluid.\n\n2.  **Generation of an Osmotic Gradient:** Fluid accumulation is not a passive process; it must be driven by an osmotic gradient. According to the provided principles, water flux ($J_w$) is proportional to the osmotic pressure difference ($\\Delta \\Pi$). To drive water into the nascent blastocoel, the osmolar concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$) inside the cavity must be higher than that of the external medium.\n\n3.  **Role of the $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase:** The creation of this osmotic gradient is the primary role of active ion transport. In polarized epithelia like the TE, the $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase is typically localized to the basolateral membrane. In the context of the blastocyst, the basolateral membrane of a TE cell is the one facing the interior of the embryo (the nascent blastocoel). The apical membrane faces the external culture medium.\n    - The $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase actively pumps $3$ $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ ions *out* of the TE cells. Due to its basolateral localization, these $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ ions are pumped *into* the intercellular spaces and the forming blastocoel cavity.\n    - This pumping action maintains a low intracellular $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ concentration.\n    - This low intracellular $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ creates a steep electrochemical gradient favoring the entry of $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ from the external medium into the TE cells through transporters (e.g., channels, exchangers) located on the apical membrane.\n    - The net result is a trans-epithelial transport of $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ from the outside medium, across the TE cell layer, and into the blastocoel.\n\n4.  **Water Flux:** The accumulation of $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ (and accompanying anions like $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$, which move to maintain charge neutrality) increases the osmolar concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$) within the blastocoel. This creates a positive osmotic pressure difference, $\\Delta \\Pi > 0$. According to the water flux equation, $J_w = L_p \\, (\\Delta \\Pi - \\Delta P)$, this osmotic gradient drives water across the TE epithelium (facilitated by aquaporins) and into the cavity, causing it to form and expand.\n\n### Prediction of Ouabain's Effect\n\nOuabain directly and specifically inhibits the $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase.\n\n-   **Effect on Blastocoel Initiation:** If ouabain is added to a pre-cavitating morula, the basolateral $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-pumps are inhibited. This immediately halts the primary mechanism for pumping $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ into the nascent blastocoel. Without this active transport, a trans-epithelial solute gradient cannot be established. Therefore, $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$ inside will not rise above $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$ outside, meaning $\\Delta \\Pi$ will remain at or near $0$. With no osmotic driving force, there will be no net water influx ($J_w \\approx 0$), and cavitation will fail to initiate.\n\n-   **Effect on a Pre-existing Blastocoel:** If a blastocoel has already formed, there is an existing high concentration of solutes within it, resulting in $\\Delta \\Pi > 0$. This osmotic pressure is balanced by the outward hydrostatic pressure ($\\Delta P > 0$) exerted by the stretched TE layer. When ouabain is added, the active pumping of $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ into the blastocoel ceases. The solute gradient ($\\Delta \\Pi$) is no longer maintained. Solutes will slowly leak out of the blastocoel across the TE (no epithelium is perfectly impermeable), causing $\\Delta \\Pi$ to decay toward $0$. The water flux equation becomes $J_w = L_p \\, (\\Delta \\Pi - \\Delta P)$. As $\\Delta \\Pi \\to 0$, the equation simplifies to $J_w \\approx L_p \\, (-\\Delta P)$. Since the hydrostatic pressure $\\Delta P$ is positive, the water flux $J_w$ becomes negative, signifying that water will flow *out* of the blastocoel, driven by the elastic recoil of the TE. This leads to the collapse of the blastocoel.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Blastocoel initiation fails when ouabain is added before cavitation, and any pre-existing blastocoel promptly collapses when ouabain is added after cavitation; TJs remain structurally intact, but inhibition of basolateral $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase in TE prevents trans-epithelial $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ accumulation, reduces $\\Delta \\Pi$, drives $J_w \\to 0$ or negative relative to $\\Delta P$, and halts or reverses fluid accumulation.**\nThis option provides a complete and accurate description of the consequences derived from first principles. It correctly identifies the failure of initiation and collapse of an existing cavity. It correctly attributes this to the inhibition of the basolateral $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase, the resultant failure to generate a trans-epithelial $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ gradient, the reduction of $\\Delta \\Pi$, and the consequent effect on water flux $J_w$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Blastocoel initiation accelerates and expansion increases because pump inhibition elevates intracellular $\\mathrm{Na}^+$, causing global cell swelling that secondarily increases paracellular leak into the blastocoel; the resulting higher $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$ in the cavity raises $\\Delta \\Pi$ and augments $J_w$.**\nThis reasoning is flawed. While pump inhibition does elevate intracellular $\\mathrm{Na}^+$, causing cell swelling, the claim that this leads to a productive paracellular leak is incorrect. The TJs are explicitly stated to *restrict* paracellular flux. A general increase in leakiness would be just as likely to dissipate any existing gradient as to create one. This mechanism is inefficient and contrary to the established primary role of trans-epithelial transport.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Blastocoel initiation and expansion are largely unaffected; the principal effect of ouabain is on late-stage zona pellucida hatching via reduced TE contractility, so cavitation proceeds normally but embryos fail to hatch despite normal fluid transport.**\nThis is incorrect. It wrongly claims that the $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase is not essential for cavitation. As derived above, the pump is the central engine for creating the osmotic gradient that drives fluid accumulation. Its inhibition would have a profound and immediate effect on blastocoel formation and maintenance, not just a downstream effect on hatching.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Compaction at the $8$-cell stage is arrested due to direct inhibition of E-cadherin by ouabain, but once compaction occurs, cavitation and blastocoel expansion proceed normally because $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase is dispensable for fluid accumulation across a sealed TE.**\nThis option contains multiple errors. The problem begins at the $16$-cell stage, making events at the $8$-cell stage irrelevant. More importantly, ouabain does not directly inhibit E-cadherin. The central claim that the $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase is \"dispensable\" is fundamentally wrong and contradicts the provided principles of epithelial transport.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Blastocoel initiation occurs but is delayed; ouabain primarily disrupts TE polarity rather than ion transport, so the embryo compensates via paracellular water entry through TJs, eventually achieving normal expansion without a trans-epithelial osmotic gradient.**\nThis option is incorrect. Ouabain's primary, direct action is on ion transport, not polarity. The idea that compensation occurs via \"paracellular water entry through TJs\" contradicts their function as a barrier. The assertion that expansion can occur \"without a trans-epithelial osmotic gradient\" violates the physical principle of osmosis, which is explicitly given as the mechanism for water movement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4427629"}, {"introduction": "The culmination of successful fluid transport is the dramatic inflation of the blastocyst, but this expansion places the single-cell-thick trophectoderm layer under significant physical strain.

The values of $P_0$ and $V_{\\mathrm{TE}}$, while given, are only necessary to establish the physical context and cancel out of the final ratio, which does not introduce a contradiction.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with the full solution.\n\nThe solution is derived from two fundamental principles: the conservation of the trophectoderm (TE) material volume and the mechanical equilibrium of a thin-walled spherical shell.\n\nFirst, we address the conservation of volume. The TE is modeled as a thin spherical shell with internal radius $r$ and thickness $h$. As the shell is thin (i.e., $h \\ll r$), its volume $V_{\\mathrm{TE}}$ can be accurately approximated by the product of its internal surface area, $A = 4\\pi r^2$, and its thickness, $h$.\n$$V_{\\mathrm{TE}} \\approx (4\\pi r^2) h$$\nSince the TE material is assumed to be incompressible, its volume $V_{\\mathrm{TE}}$ is a constant throughout the expansion process. We can express the thickness $h$ as a function of the radius $r$:\n$$h(r) = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{TE}}}{4\\pi r^2}$$\nThis shows that the thickness of the TE wall decreases with the inverse square of the cavity radius, $h \\propto r^{-2}$.\n\nNext, we apply the principle of mechanical equilibrium for a thin-walled spherical pressure vessel. For a sphere of radius $r$ and thickness $h$ subject to a uniform internal pressure $P_0$ (and assuming negligible external pressure), the circumferential (or hoop) Cauchy stress, $\\sigma_{\\theta}$, is given by the Young-Laplace equation for a sphere:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{P_0 r}{2h}$$\n\nWe can now combine these two results to determine how the stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ scales with the radius $r$. Substituting the expression for $h(r)$ from the volume conservation equation into the stress equation:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{P_0 r}{2 \\left( \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{TE}}}{4\\pi r^2} \\right)}$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the relationship between stress and radius:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{P_0 r \\cdot 4\\pi r^2}{2 V_{\\mathrm{TE}}} = \\frac{2\\pi P_0}{V_{\\mathrm{TE}}} r^3$$\nSince the internal pressure $P_0$ and the TE volume $V_{\\mathrm{TE}}$ are given as constants, the entire term $\\frac{2\\pi P_0}{V_{\\mathrm{TE}}}$ is a constant. Therefore, the circumferential stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ scales with the cube of the internal radius $r$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta}(r) \\propto r^3$$\nThis completes the first part of the task, which is to derive the scaling law.\n\nTo complete the second part of the task, we compute the ratio of the stress at radius $r_2$ to the stress at radius $r_1$. Using the derived scaling law:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta}(r_2)}{\\sigma_{\\theta}(r_1)} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\pi P_0}{V_{\\mathrm{TE}}} r_2^3}{\\frac{2\\pi P_0}{V_{\\mathrm{TE}}} r_1^3}$$\nThe constant terms cancel, and the ratio depends only on the radii:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta}(r_2)}{\\sigma_{\\theta}(r_1)} = \\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)^3$$\nWe are given the initial and final radii as $r_1 = 60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $r_2 = 90\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.
