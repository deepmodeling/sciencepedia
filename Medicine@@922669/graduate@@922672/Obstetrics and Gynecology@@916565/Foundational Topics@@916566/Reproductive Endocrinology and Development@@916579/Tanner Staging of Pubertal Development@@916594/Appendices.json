According to Tanner staging, the patient is documented at breast stage $B2$ at time $t=0$ months and at breast stage $B3$ at time $t=12$ months, indicating a transition from $B2$ to $B3$ over $12$ months. Height was measured every $6$ months during this interval using the same calibrated stadiometer.

It utilizes standard clinical tools (Tanner staging) and physiological concepts (pubertal growth spurt, Peak Height Velocity) from medicine and auxology. The data provided (ages, heights, and Tanner stages) are physiologically consistent and realistic for a female adolescent. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary information for the required calculation and subsequent clinical inference. There are no internal contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of fundamental principles. The question asks for a standard calculation followed by a reasoned conclusion based on established evidence, which is a valid form of scientific inquiry.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe primary task is to compute the annualized growth velocity and then use this value, in conjunction with established principles of pubertal development, to make an inference about the patient's position relative to her Peak Height Velocity (PHV).\n\nFirst, we calculate the annualized growth velocity, $v_g$, over the specified $12$-month interval. Growth velocity is defined as the change in height, $\\Delta H$, over the elapsed time interval, $\\Delta t$.\n\nThe initial height at $t=0$ months is $H_{initial} = 140.2$ cm.\nThe final height at $t=12$ months is $H_{final} = 147.9$ cm.\n\nThe total change in height, $\\Delta H$, over this period is:\n$$\n\\Delta H = H_{final} - H_{initial} = 147.9 \\text{ cm} - 140.2 \\text{ cm} = 7.7 \\text{ cm}\n$$\n\nThe time interval, $\\Delta t$, is $12$ months, which is equivalent to $1$ year.\n$$\n\\Delta t = 12 \\text{ months} = 1 \\text{ year}\n$$\n\nThe annualized growth velocity, $v_g$, is therefore:\n$$\nv_g = \\frac{\\Delta H}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{7.7 \\text{ cm}}{1 \\text{ year}} = 7.7 \\text{ cm/year}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$\nv_g \\approx 7.70 \\text{ cm/year}\n$$\n\nNext, we address the inference regarding the patient's position relative to PHV. This requires contextualizing the calculated velocity with established physiological facts about female puberty.\n\n1.  **Tanner Staging and PHV Timing**: In females, the pubertal growth spurt begins early in puberty, typically concurrent with thelarche (the onset of breast development, Tanner stage $B2$). PHV, the point of maximum growth rate, most commonly occurs between Tanner breast stages $B2$ and $B3$. It almost always precedes menarche. The patient's progression from stage $B2$ to $B3$ over the $12$-month observation period places her squarely within the expected window for PHV.\n\n2.  **Magnitude of Velocity**: The average PHV in females is approximately $8$ to $9$ cm/year, though there is significant individual variability. The calculated velocity of $7.70$ cm/year is a high growth rate, characteristic of the pubertal spurt and close to the typical range for PHV.\n\n3.  **Velocity Trend Analysis**: The problem provides an intermediate height measurement at $t=6$ months, which allows for a more granular analysis of the velocity trend. We can compute the annualized velocity for the two consecutive $6$-month intervals.\n\n    For the first interval ($t=0$ to $t=6$ months):\n    $\\Delta H_1 = H_6 - H_0 = 144.1 \\text{ cm} - 140.2 \\text{ cm} = 3.9 \\text{ cm}$.\n    $\\Delta t_1 = 6 \\text{ months} = 0.5 \\text{ years}$.\n    $v_{g,1} = \\frac{3.9 \\text{ cm}}{0.5 \\text{ years}} = 7.8 \\text{ cm/year}$.\n\n    For the second interval ($t=6$ to $t=12$ months):\n    $\\Delta H_2 = H_{12} - H_6 = 147.9 \\text{ cm} - 144.1 \\text{ cm} = 3.8 \\text{ cm}$.\n    $\\Delta t_2 = 6 \\text{ months} = 0.5 \\text{ years}$.\n    $v_{g,2} = \\frac{3.8 \\text{ cm}}{0.5 \\text{ years}} = 7.6 \\text{ cm/year}$.\n\n    The analysis reveals a velocity of $7.8$ cm/year in the first half of the year, followed by a slightly lower velocity of $7.6$ cm/year in the second half.\n\n**Inference and Justification**:\nThe patient is in the correct developmental window (transitioning from $B2$ to $B3$) for PHV. The average velocity of $7.70$ cm/year is high, consistent with the pubertal growth spurt. The most revealing evidence is the trend observed over the two 6-month intervals: the annualized velocity slightly decreased from $7.8$ cm/year to $7.6$ cm/year. This pattern of a very high but decelerating growth rate is the classic signature of an individual who has just passed her PHV. The absolute peak was likely at or slightly above $7.8$ cm/year and occurred near the beginning or middle of the observation period. Therefore, the evidence strongly suggests the patient is **just past** her Peak Height Velocity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7.70}\n$$", "id": "4515733"}, {"introduction": "The physiological upheaval of normal puberty can closely mimic the signs of endocrine pathology, presenting a significant diagnostic challenge.

The data provided (age, Tanner stage, BMI, menstrual pattern, hirsutism score) are internally consistent and plausible.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in the established medical fields of pediatric endocrinology and adolescent gynecology. Tanner staging, PCOS diagnostic criteria (including adolescent-specific modifications), and the physiology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis maturation are all well-established scientific concepts.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a detailed clinical vignette and asks for an interpretation based on established diagnostic guidelines. It is structured to test the knowledge of an important clinical distinction.\n-   **Objective**: The presentation is objective, using standard clinical terminology (e.g., mFG score, Tanner staging) and providing quantitative data where appropriate.\n\n**Verdict**: The problem is valid, scientifically sound, and well-posed. It requires a nuanced understanding of adolescent development and the specific challenges of diagnosing PCOS in this population.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe core of this problem is to apply the diagnostic criteria for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) while acknowledging the significant physiological overlaps with normal puberty in an adolescent. The patient is a $12$-year-old girl who is $8$ months post-menarche.\n\n**1. Analysis of Patient's Clinical Findings:**\n-   **Pubertal Maturation**: The patient is at Tanner stage B $5$ and P $5$. This indicates she has completed somatic pubertal development, which is appropriate for her age, given menarche at $11.3$ years.\n-   **Menstrual Irregularity**: Her cycles are between $45$ and $75$ days long. During the first one to two years following menarche, the HPO axis is still maturing. Anovulatory cycles are common, leading to significant menstrual irregularity. This is considered a normal physiological process. The international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS (2018) defines abnormal menstrual cycles for adolescents as:\n    -   For $>1$ year to $<3$ years post-menarche: cycles outside the range of $21-45$ days.\n    -   For $>3$ years post-menarche: cycles outside the range of $21-35$ days or $<8$ cycles per year.\n    -   In the first year post-menarche (as in this patient), extreme cycle variation is common, and cycles exceeding $90$ days are a more specific indicator of a problem. This patient's cycles are irregular but have not exceeded $90$ days. Therefore, her menstrual pattern, while irregular, is consistent with normal early post-menarchal physiology.\n-   **Hyperandrogenism**: The patient has two clinical signs of hyperandrogenism: moderate acne and hirsutism. Her modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) score is $10$. A score $\\geq 8$ is a standard cutoff for defining hirsutism. Acne is also a clinical sign of hyperandrogenism but is very common in normal adolescence. The presence of hirsutism (mFG score of $10$) is a more specific and significant finding.\n-   **Exclusion of Other Disorders**: There are no signs of rapid virilization (clitoromegaly, voice deepening), making an androgen-secreting tumor unlikely. The family history is negative for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), though serum testing (e.g., for $17$-hydroxyprogesterone) is still required for definitive exclusion.\n\n**2. Application of Adolescent PCOS Diagnostic Criteria:**\nThe diagnosis of PCOS in adults (Rotterdam criteria) requires two of the following three: (1) oligo- or anovulation, (2) clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, (3) polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound, plus the exclusion of other etiologies.\n\nFor adolescents, these criteria are modified due to the physiological confounders of puberty:\n-   **Criterion 1 (Oligo/anovulation)**: As discussed, menstrual irregularity is normal in the first $1-2$ years post-menarche. Thus, this criterion cannot be confidently applied to this patient who is only $8$ months post-menarche. A diagnosis of PCOS requires *persistent* menstrual irregularity, typically defined as irregularity lasting beyond $2$ years post-menarche.\n-   **Criterion 2 (Hyperandrogenism)**: The patient has clear clinical hyperandrogenism (hirsutism with an mFG score of $10$). This is a required criterion for an adolescent PCOS diagnosis.\n-   **Criterion 3 (PCOM)**: Multicystic-appearing ovaries are a common and normal finding in healthy pubertal girls. Therefore, pelvic ultrasound is **not recommended** for the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents within $8$ years of menarche, as it has low specificity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis patient has one of the required criteria for PCOS (hyperandrogenism). The other criterion (oligo-ovulation) is present but is most likely physiologic at this stage. A diagnosis of PCOS is therefore \"at risk\" or \"provisional\" but cannot be definitively made at this time. The appropriate course of action is to complete the biochemical workup to exclude other causes of hyperandrogenism and to monitor her menstrual pattern over the next one to two years.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Because she has reached Tanner B$5$ and P$5$, failure to achieve regular ovulatory cycles within $6$ months after menarche is abnormal; she meets criteria for PCOS now and should be started on antiandrogens.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It is physiologically normal for menstrual cycles to be irregular for $1-2$ years post-menarche as the HPO axis matures. A $6$-month timeframe is arbitrarily short and not supported by evidence or guidelines. Tanner staging completion reflects somatic maturity, not necessarily ovulatory cycle regularity. A diagnosis of PCOS is not yet warranted, and initiating antiandrogens would be premature.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. Despite B$5$/P$5$, irregular cycles and acne within the first $1$–$2$ years after menarche can be physiologic; a diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents should require persistent menstrual irregularity beyond $2$ years post menarche plus clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, after exclusion of other etiologies; ovarian ultrasound morphology is not recommended for diagnosis in those within approximately $8$ years post menarche.**\nThis statement accurately reflects the current international consensus guidelines on diagnosing PCOS in adolescents. It correctly identifies the physiologic nature of early-postmenarchal menstrual irregularity, sets an appropriate time frame for reassessment (persistent irregularity $>2$ years post-menarche), notes the necessity of hyperandrogenism, and correctly states that ultrasound for PCOM is not recommended in this age group.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Given acne and hirsutism, a pelvic ultrasound demonstrating polycystic ovarian morphology is sufficient to diagnose PCOS now regardless of time since menarche.**\nThis statement is incorrect. First, as stated, PCOM on ultrasound is not a reliable diagnostic criterion in adolescents. Second, even if it were, a diagnosis of PCOS cannot be made on PCOM and hyperandrogenism alone in an adolescent, as the menstrual irregularity criterion is confounded by normal physiology. The guidelines are clear that ultrasound should not be used for this purpose in the early post-menarchal years.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Hirsutism is never physiologic in adolescence; any mFG score $\\geq 8$ mandates immediate diagnosis of PCOS.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While an mFG score $\\geq 8$ indicates hirsutism, which is a pathologic sign of hyperandrogenism, it is not by itself \"diagnostic of PCOS\". Hirsutism is a symptom that necessitates a workup to identify the cause. An immediate diagnosis of PCOS is inappropriate, as other serious conditions (e.g., NCAH, androgen-secreting tumors) must be excluded first.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Tanner P$5$ at age $12$ is diagnostic of premature adrenarche and supports immediate PCOS diagnosis.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Premature adrenarche is the onset of pubic hair development before age $8$ in girls. This patient's pubertal development is timed normally; she is $12$ years old and has completed puberty (Tanner P$5$), which is entirely appropriate. Her pubertal development is synchronous (breast and pubic hair development together), not a case of isolated premature adrenarche.
