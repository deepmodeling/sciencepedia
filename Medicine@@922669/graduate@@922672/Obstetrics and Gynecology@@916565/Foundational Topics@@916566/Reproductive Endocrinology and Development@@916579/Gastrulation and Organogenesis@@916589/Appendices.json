A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three stages: first, deriving the steady-state concentration profile $C(x)$; second, determining the critical concentration $C^{\\ast}$ that defines the boundary; and third, solving for the boundary position $x^{\\ast}$.\n\n**1. Steady-State Morphogen Concentration Profile $C(x)$**\nThe spatiotemporal evolution of the morphogen concentration $C(x, t)$ is described by the reaction-diffusion equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} - kC $$\nAt steady state, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = 0$, which simplifies the equation to a second-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ D \\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} - kC = 0 $$\nThe general solution to this equation is $C(x) = A \\exp(\\sqrt{k/D} \\cdot x) + B \\exp(-\\sqrt{k/D} \\cdot x)$. We apply the given boundary conditions to determine the constants $A$ and $B$.\n- The condition that $C(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$ requires that the coefficient of the diverging term, $\\exp(\\sqrt{k/D} \\cdot x)$, must be zero. Thus, $A=0$. The solution reduces to $C(x) = B \\exp(-x\\sqrt{k/D})$.\n- The constant source flux at $x=0$ is $J$. The flux is given by Fick's first law: $F(x) = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$.\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dx} = -B\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) $$\nAt $x=0$, the flux is $F(0) = -D \\left(-B\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) = B\\sqrt{Dk}$.\nSetting this equal to the source flux $J$:\n$$ J = B\\sqrt{Dk} \\implies B = \\frac{J}{\\sqrt{Dk}} $$\nThe constant $B$ represents the concentration at the source, $C(0)$. The complete steady-state concentration profile is therefore:\n$$ C(x) = \\frac{J}{\\sqrt{Dk}} \\exp\\left(-x\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) $$\n\n**2. Critical Concentration $C^{\\ast}$ at the Boundary**\nThe boundary between Class I and Class II TF domains is located at $x^{\\ast}$, where the regulatory influences are balanced: $f_{A}(C(x^{\\ast})) = f_{R}(C(x^{\\ast}))$. Let $C^{\\ast} = C(x^{\\ast})$ be the concentration at this position.\n$$ \\frac{C^{\\ast}}{K_{A}+C^{\\ast}} = \\frac{K_{R}}{K_{R}+C^{\\ast}} $$\nCross-multiplication yields:\n$$ C^{\\ast}(K_{R}+C^{\\ast}) = K_{R}(K_{A}+C^{\\ast}) $$\n$$ C^{\\ast}K_{R} + (C^{\\ast})^2 = K_{R}K_{A} + K_{R}C^{\\ast} $$\nThe term $C^{\\ast}K_{R}$ cancels from both sides, leaving:\n$$ (C^{\\ast})^2 = K_{A}K_{R} $$\nSince concentration must be a positive quantity, we take the principal root:\n$$ C^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{K_{A}K_{R}} $$\n\n**3. Analytic Expression for Boundary Position $x^{\\ast}$**\nThe boundary position $x^{\\ast}$ is the location where the morphogen concentration equals the critical value $C^{\\ast}$. We equate the expressions for $C(x^{\\ast})$ and $C^{\\ast}$:\n$$ \\frac{J}{\\sqrt{Dk}} \\exp\\left(-x^{\\ast}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) = \\sqrt{K_{A}K_{R}} $$\nTo solve for $x^{\\ast}$, we first isolate the exponential term:\n$$ \\exp\\left(-x^{\\ast}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{DkK_{A}K_{R}}}{J} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -x^{\\ast}\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{DkK_{A}K_{R}}}{J}\\right) $$\nSolving for $x^{\\ast}$ and using the identity $-\\ln(z) = \\ln(1/z)$:\n$$ x^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{J}{\\sqrt{DkK_{A}K_{R}}}\\right) $$\nThis is the required analytical expression for the boundary position.\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\nWe now substitute the given parameter values to compute $x^{\\ast}$.\nFirst, calculate the characteristic length scale $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{10\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m^{2}\\ s^{-1}}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}}} = \\sqrt{10^4\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m^2}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m} $$\nNext, calculate the term in the denominator of the logarithm's argument:\n$$ \\sqrt{DkK_{A}K_{R}} = \\sqrt{(10)(1.0 \\times 10^{-3})(200)(50)}\\ \\mathrm{molecules\\ \\mu m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}} $$\n$$ = \\sqrt{(10^{-2})(10^4)}\\ \\mathrm{molecules\\ \\mu m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}} = \\sqrt{100}\\ \\mathrm{molecules\\ \\mu m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}} = 10\\ \\mathrm{molecules\\ \\mu m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}} $$\nNow, compute the argument of the logarithm:\n$$ \\frac{J}{\\sqrt{DkK_{A}K_{R}}} = \\frac{100\\ \\mathrm{molecules\\ \\mu m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}}}{10\\ \\mathrm{molecules\\ \\mu m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}}} = 10 $$\nSubstitute these results into the expression for $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$ x^{\\ast} = (100\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}) \\ln(10) $$\nUsing the value $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$:\n$$ x^{\\ast} \\approx (100)(2.302585)\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m} = 230.2585\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in millimeters ($1\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$) and rounded to four significant figures:\n$$ x^{\\ast} = 0.2302585\\ \\mathrm{mm} \\approx 0.2303\\ \\mathrm{mm} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2303}$$", "id": "4443985"}, {"introduction": "While static gradients pattern many tissues, other structures form sequentially through the coordination of space and time.

It is scientifically grounded in the established clock-and-wavefront model of somitogenesis, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, formal language.

Second, we must quantify the deviation of observed somite lengths from this expectation by computing the root-mean-square fractional deviation, $D$.\n\nPart 1: Deduction of Expected Somite Length, $L_{\\mathrm{exp}}$\n\nThe problem is framed by the clock-and-wavefront model. We are given two key parameters:\n1.  The speed of the determination wavefront, $v$, which is the rate at which the developmental instruction for segmentation propagates along the posterior-to-anterior axis. By definition, speed is the distance traveled per unit time. For a constant speed, this relationship is $v = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$, where $\\Delta x$ is the distance covered in a time interval $\\Delta t$.\n2.  The period of the segmentation clock, $P$, which is the time required for the oscillatory gene expression within presomitic mesoderm cells to complete one full cycle.\n\nThe model posits that a somite boundary is formed at a specific location and time when the advancing wavefront intersects cells that are at a particular, consistent phase of their oscillatory cycle. Let us consider the formation of two successive boundaries.\n\nLet the first boundary form at time $t_{1}$ and position $x_{1}$. At this instant, the wavefront is at $x_{1}$. The second, more anterior boundary will form at a later time $t_{2}$ at position $x_{2}$. For this to occur, the clock in the cells at position $x_{2}$ must reach the same critical phase as the cells at $x_{1}$ did at time $t_{1}$. By the definition of the period $P$, the time elapsed between these two successive segmentation events must be exactly one period of the clock. Therefore, the time interval is $\\Delta t = t_{2} - t_{1} = P$.\n\nDuring this time interval $P$, the determination wavefront has advanced from position $x_{1}$ to position $x_{2}$. The distance covered by the wavefront is $\\Delta x = x_{2} - x_{1}$. This distance, the separation between two successive boundaries, is precisely the length of the newly formed somite. We denote this expected length as $L_{\\mathrm{exp}}$.\n\nUsing the fundamental definition of constant speed, the distance traveled is the product of speed and time elapsed.\n$$L_{\\mathrm{exp}} = \\Delta x = v \\cdot \\Delta t$$\nSubstituting $\\Delta t = P$ into this equation, we arrive at the first-principles relationship for the expected somite length:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{exp}} = v \\cdot P$$\nWe are given the values $v = 0.2 \\, \\mathrm{mm/h}$ and $P = 5 \\, \\mathrm{h}$. Substituting these into our derived equation yields:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{exp}} = (0.2 \\, \\mathrm{mm/h}) \\times (5 \\, \\mathrm{h}) = 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Root-Mean-Square Fractional Deviation, $D$\n\nThe problem provides the formula for the root-mean-square fractional deviation:\n$$D = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\frac{L_{i} - L_{\\mathrm{exp}}}{L_{\\mathrm{exp}}}\\right)^{2}}$$\nWe are given $n=6$ observed somite lengths: $L_{1} = 0.94 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$, $L_{2} = 1.07 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$, $L_{3} = 1.00 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$, $L_{4} = 0.96 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$, $L_{5} = 1.10 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$, and $L_{6} = 0.92 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$.
