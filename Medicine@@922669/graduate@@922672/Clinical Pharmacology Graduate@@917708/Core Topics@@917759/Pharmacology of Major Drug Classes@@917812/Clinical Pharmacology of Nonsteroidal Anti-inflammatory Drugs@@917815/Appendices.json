The premises are internally consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Free Drug Concentration ($C_f$)**\n\nThe problem provides the definition for the fraction of drug unbound in plasma, $f_u$, as the ratio of the free drug concentration, $C_f$, to the total drug concentration, $C_{\\text{tot}}$:\n$$f_u = \\frac{C_f}{C_{\\text{tot}}}$$\nTo calculate the free drug concentration, this equation is rearranged:\n$$C_f = f_u \\times C_{\\text{tot}}$$\nThe given values are $C_{\\text{tot}} = 100\\,\\mu\\text{g/mL}$ and $f_u = 0.02$. Substituting these values into the equation:\n$$C_f = 0.02 \\times 100\\,\\mu\\text{g/mL}$$\n$$C_f = 2.00\\,\\mu\\text{g/mL}$$\nThe result is already expressed to three significant figures as required.\n\n**Part 2: Justification for the Role of Free Drug Concentration ($C_f$)**\n\nThe justification that the free drug concentration ($C_f$), rather than the total drug concentration ($C_{\\text{tot}}$), determines the pharmacological effect on cyclooxygenase (COX) in peripheral tissues is based on the **free drug hypothesis** and the **law of mass action**. The argument proceeds in three steps: drug distribution to the target site, drug-target binding, and the resulting pharmacological response.\n\n1.  **Distribution to the Target Site:** The fundamental tenet of the free drug hypothesis is that only the unbound drug is pharmacologically active because only this fraction can move between body compartments and interact with its target. In the plasma, the drug exists in two states: bound to proteins (primarily albumin for acidic NSAIDs) and free in solution. The total concentration is the sum of these two: $C_{\\text{tot}} = C_f + C_b$, where $C_b$ is the bound concentration. The problem specifies the assumption of **passive distribution across fenestrated capillaries**, which are characteristic of inflammatory sites in rheumatoid arthritis. These capillaries have pores that are permeable to small molecules like the NSAID but are impermeable to large macromolecules like albumin. Therefore, only the free drug, with concentration $C_f$, can pass from the plasma into the interstitial fluid surrounding the target cells. The albumin-bound drug is confined to the vascular compartment and cannot reach the target.\n\n2.  **Equilibrium at the Target Site:** The problem specifies the assumption that **steady state has been reached, and the free concentrations in plasma and interstitial fluid have equilibrated**. This means that the concentration of free drug in the interstitial fluid of the target tissue, denoted as $C_{f, \\text{tissue}}$, is equal to the free drug concentration in the plasma:\n    $$C_{f, \\text{tissue}} = C_f$$\n    This $C_{f, \\text{tissue}}$ is the concentration of drug that is available to bind to the COX enzymes located within the cells of the peripheral tissue.\n\n3.  **Drug-Target Binding and Pharmacological Effect:** The interaction between a drug ($D$) and its target receptor or enzyme ($R$), in this case, the COX enzyme, is a reversible binding process governed by the **law of mass action**:\n    $$D + R \\underset{k_{off}}{\\stackrel{k_{on}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} DR$$\n    Here, $DR$ is the drug-receptor complex, $k_{on}$ is the association rate constant, and $k_{off}$ is the dissociation rate constant. At equilibrium, the relationship is described by the dissociation constant, $K_D$:\n    $$K_D = \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}} = \\frac{[D][R]}{[DR]}$$\n    The term $[D]$ in this equation represents the concentration of free drug at the site of the receptor, which we have established is $C_{f, \\text{tissue}} = C_f$. The pharmacological effect of an NSAID (inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis) is directly related to the fraction of COX enzymes that are occupied by the drug. This fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is given by:\n    $$\\theta = \\frac{[DR]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[DR]}{[R] + [DR]}$$\n    By rearranging the $K_D$ expression, we can express $\\theta$ as a function of the free drug concentration:\n    $$K_D [DR] = [D] [R] \\implies [R] = \\frac{K_D [DR]}{[D]}$$\n    Substituting this into the denominator for $\\theta$:\n    $$\\theta = \\frac{[DR]}{\\frac{K_D [DR]}{[D]} + [DR]} = \\frac{[DR]}{[DR] \\left( \\frac{K_D}{[D]} + 1 \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D}{[D]} + 1} = \\frac{[D]}{K_D + [D]}$$\n    Replacing $[D]$ with the relevant concentration, $C_f$, we obtain the pivotal relationship:\n    $$\\theta = \\frac{C_f}{K_D + C_f}$$\n    This equation explicitly demonstrates that the target occupancy ($\\theta$), and thus the intensity of the pharmacological effect, is a direct function of the free drug concentration ($C_f$) and the affinity of the drug for its target ($K_D$). The total concentration, $C_{\\text{tot}}$, does not appear in this equation because the protein-bound fraction is sequestered in the plasma and is pharmacologically unavailable to the tissue-level target. The assumption of **non-saturable albumin binding** ensures that $f_u$ (and thus the ratio of $C_f$ to $C_{\\text{tot}}$) remains constant across the therapeutic concentration range, simplifying the pharmacokinetic relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, $C_f$ determines the concentration gradient for drug diffusion into the tissue, equilibrates with the free drug concentration at the target site, and directly drives the drug-target binding equilibrium according to the law of mass action. Therefore, $C_f$, not $C_{\\text{tot}}$, is the pharmacologically relevant concentration that governs the downstream tissue effect.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.00}\n$$", "id": "4538893"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a static view to a dynamic one, this problem challenges you to design a rational dosing regimen based on a drug's pharmacokinetic profile.

The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core principle for calculating the absolute annual risk ($p$) throughout this problem is the multiplicative model for independent risk factors, which states that the combined risk is the product of the baseline risk and all applicable relative risks and modification factors.\n\nFirst, we establish the patient's absolute annual risk under combined therapy with a nonselective NSAID and an anticoagulant, before any mitigation strategies are applied. This will serve as the reference risk. The relative risks are $RR_{\\text{NSAID}} = 3$ and $RR_{\\text{AC}} = 5$.\nThe initial combined risk, $p_{\\text{initial}}$, is:\n$$p_{\\text{initial}} = p_{0} \\times RR_{\\text{NSAID}} \\times RR_{\\text{AC}}$$\n$$p_{\\text{initial}} = 0.01 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 0.15$$\n\nNext, we calculate the absolute annual risk under each of the three proposed mitigation strategies.\n\n**Strategy A: Co-prescribe a PPI**\nThis strategy introduces a multiplicative factor, $f_{A} = 0.6$, which applies to the overall risk. Therefore, the risk under Strategy A, $p_{A}$, is the initial combined risk multiplied by this factor.\n$$p_{A} = p_{\\text{initial}} \\times f_{A} = (p_{0} \\times RR_{\\text{NSAID}} \\times RR_{\\text{AC}}) \\times f_{A}$$\n$$p_{A} = 0.15 \\times 0.6 = 0.09$$\n\n**Strategy B: Switch to a COX-2 selective NSAID**\nThis strategy changes the NSAID-specific relative risk from $RR_{\\text{NSAID}} = 3$ to $RR_{\\text{NSAID,COX2}} = 1.7$. The relative risk from anticoagulation, $RR_{\\text{AC}} = 5$, remains unchanged. The risk under Strategy B, $p_{B}$, is calculated using the updated NSAID relative risk.\n$$p_{B} = p_{0} \\times RR_{\\text{NSAID,COX2}} \\times RR_{\\text{AC}}$$\n$$p_{B} = 0.01 \\times 1.7 \\times 5 = 0.01 \\times 8.5 = 0.085$$\n\n**Strategy C: Implement both Strategy A and Strategy B**\nThis strategy combines the changes from both A and B. The NSAID relative risk is updated to $RR_{\\text{NSAID,COX2}} = 1.7$, and the overall risk is multiplied by the PPI factor $f_{A} = 0.6$. Since the effects are stated to be independent and multiplicative, we apply all factors to the baseline risk.\n$$p_{C} = p_{0} \\times RR_{\\text{NSAID,COX2}} \\times RR_{\\text{AC}} \\times f_{A}$$\nThis is equivalent to applying the PPI factor to the risk calculated in Strategy B:\n$$p_{C} = p_{B} \\times f_{A}$$\n$$p_{C} = 0.085 \\times 0.6 = 0.051$$\n\nFinally, we compare the absolute annual risks calculated for the three strategies to find the lowest achievable risk.\n- Risk with Strategy A: $p_{A} = 0.09$\n- Risk with Strategy B: $p_{B} = 0.085$\n- Risk with Strategy C: $p_{C} = 0.051$\n\nComparing these values, we find that $p_{C} < p_{B} < p_{A}$. The lowest achievable absolute annual risk is $0.051$. The problem requires this answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.
