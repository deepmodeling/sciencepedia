The provided values for clearance and volume of distribution are physiologically plausible for certain benzodiazepines in humans. The context is appropriate for clinical pharmacology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary parameters ($CL$, $V_d$, $\\tau$) to uniquely determine the requested quantities ($t_{1/2}$, $R_{ss}$) using standard, well-defined pharmacokinetic equations.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions, missing information, or other invalidating flaws. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first determining the first-order elimination rate constant, $k_e$, which is a fundamental parameter derived from the given clearance and volume of distribution. This constant is then used to compute both the elimination half-life and the accumulation ratio.\n\nThe relationship between systemic clearance ($CL$), apparent volume of distribution ($V_d$), and the first-order elimination rate constant ($k_e$) in a one-compartment model is given by the definition of clearance:\n$$CL = k_e \\cdot V_{d}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $k_e$:\n$$k_e = \\frac{CL}{V_{d}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$k_e = \\frac{15\\ \\mathrm{L/h}}{120\\ \\mathrm{L}} = 0.125\\ \\mathrm{h^{-1}}$$\n\nFirst, we compute the terminal elimination half-life, $t_{1/2}$. For a first-order process, the half-life is defined as the time required for the concentration to decrease by half. It is related to the elimination rate constant by the following equation:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_e}$$\nSubstituting the calculated value of $k_e$:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.125\\ \\mathrm{h^{-1}}}$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69314718...$:\n$$t_{1/2} \\approx \\frac{0.69314718}{0.125}\\ \\mathrm{h} \\approx 5.54517744\\ \\mathrm{h}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get:\n$$t_{1/2} = 5.545\\ \\mathrm{h}$$\n\nNext, we compute the accumulation ratio at steady state, $R_{ss}$. This ratio quantifies the extent to which a drug accumulates in the body with repeated dosing. For a drug administered at a constant interval $\\tau$, it is defined as:\n$$R_{ss} = \\frac{1}{1 - f}$$\nwhere $f$ is the fraction of drug remaining in the body just before the next dose, given by $f = \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$.

Consider a single oral dose $D$ with oral bioavailability $F$ that is unaffected by coadministration. Zolpidem exhibits first-order elimination and linear pharmacokinetics. Assume that protein binding (fraction unbound in plasma $f_{u}$) and hepatic blood flow $Q_{h}$ remain unchanged. Using the well-stirred model of hepatic clearance and the low-extraction assumption, proceed as follows.\n\nFoundational definitions and relationships:\n- The area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) is defined by $ \\mathrm{AUC} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t)\\,dt$, and for linear, time-invariant pharmacokinetics following a single dose $D$ with bioavailability $F$, $ \\mathrm{AUC} = \\frac{F D}{CL}$, where $CL$ is the total body clearance.\n- The Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme contributes to hepatic metabolism of zolpidem.
