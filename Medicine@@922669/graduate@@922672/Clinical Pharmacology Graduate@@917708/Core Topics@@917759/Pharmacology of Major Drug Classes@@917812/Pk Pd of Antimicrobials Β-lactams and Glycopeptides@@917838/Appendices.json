The concentration at any time $t$ after the start of an infusion at steady state is a complex function of the regimen and pharmacokinetic parameters. The trough concentration, which occurs at the end of the dosing interval, right before the next dose, is given by:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{trough}} = \\frac{D/t_{\\mathrm{inf}}}{k_e V} \\frac{(1 - \\exp(-k_e t_{\\mathrm{inf}}))}{(1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau))} \\exp(-k_e(\\tau - t_{\\mathrm{inf}}))\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the dose per interval, $t_{\\mathrm{inf}}$ is the infusion duration, $\\tau$ is the dosing interval, $V$ is the volume of distribution, and $k_e$ is the elimination rate constant. Since $k_e = CL/V$, the equation for $C_{\\mathrm{trough}}$ can be written to show its dependencies:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{trough}} = f(D, t_{\\mathrm{inf}}, \\tau, CL, V)\n$$\nUnlike $AUC_{24}$, the trough concentration $C_{\\mathrm{trough}}$ depends critically on the volume of distribution, $V$, and the specific details of the dosing regimen ($D$, $t_{\\mathrmf}$, $\\tau$), not just the total daily dose $D_{24}$.\n\nWith this understanding, we can evaluate necessity and sufficiency.\n\n*   **Is $C_{\\mathrm{trough}}$ targeting sufficient?** No. Sufficiency would mean that if any patient achieves $C_{\\mathrm{trough}} = 15\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$, they will also have achieved $AUC_{24} = 500\\ \\mathrm{mg\\cdot h/L}$. This is false. Consider two patients with the same clearance, $CL = 4\\ \\mathrm{L/h}$, but different volumes of distribution, $V_1$ and $V_2$. Because their $V$ values differ, their elimination rate constants ($k_e = CL/V$) will differ. To achieve the same $C_{\\mathrm{trough}} = 15\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$, they will require different dosing regimens (different combinations of $D$, $\\tau$, $t_{\\mathrm{inf}}$). These different regimens will generally result in different total daily doses, $D_{24}$. Since $AUC_{24} = D_{24}/CL$, the two patients will have different $AUC_{24}$ values. Therefore, achieving the target trough concentration does not guarantee achieving the target $AUC_{24}$.\n\n*   **Is $C_{\\mathrm{trough}}$ targeting necessary?** No. Necessity would mean that to achieve $AUC_{24} = 500\\ \\mathrm{mg\\cdot h/L}$, a patient *must* have a $C_{\\mathrm{trough}}$ of $15\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. This is also false. For a given patient with fixed $CL$ and $V$, we know that any regimen delivering a total daily dose of $D_{24} = 2000 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$ will achieve the target $AUC_{24} = 500\\ \\mathrm{mg\\cdot h/L}$. However, different valid regimens will produce different trough concentrations. For example, a regimen of $1000\\ \\mathrm{mg}$ every $12$ hours will have a different $C_{\\mathrm{trough}}$ than a regimen of $500\\ \\mathrm{mg}$ every $6$ hours, or a continuous infusion of $2000\\ \\mathrm{mg/day}$. A continuous infusion would result in a constant steady-state concentration of $C_{ss} = D_{24}/(CL \\cdot 24\\ \\mathrm{h}) = 2000/(4 \\cdot 24) \\approx 20.8\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$, where the \"trough\" is $20.8\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$, not $15\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. Yet, the $AUC_{24}$ target is met. Therefore, achieving a specific trough value is not a necessary condition.\n\nIn conclusion, trough concentration monitoring is neither necessary nor sufficient for achieving a target $AUC_{24}$ because $C_{\\mathrm{trough}}$ is a function of both patient-specific parameters ($CL$, $V$) and regimen-specific parameters ($D$, $\\tau$, $t_{\\mathrm{inf}}$), whereas $AUC_{24}$ is a more direct measure of drug exposure that depends only on the total daily dose and clearance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.00 \\times 10^{3}}$$", "id": "4579302"}]}
