This relationship is rarely linear; instead, it often follows a sigmoidal curve, indicating saturation of the drug's target.

Express the final SBP reduction in mmHg.", "solution": "The problem requires two main tasks: first, to derive the sigmoid maximum-effect (Emax) model, also known as the Hill equation, from first principles of receptor theory; and second, to apply this model to calculate the expected reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) for a given drug concentration.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Concentration-Effect Relationship**\n\nThe derivation begins with the law of mass action applied to the binding of a drug (ligand), denoted by $D$, to its receptor, $R$. For simplicity, and as a basis for the Hill model, we consider a cooperative binding process where $n$ molecules of the drug bind to a receptor entity to form a drug-receptor complex, which we can represent functionally as $DR_n$. The reversible reaction is:\n$$n D + R \\underset{k_{off}}{\\stackrel{k_{on}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} DR_n$$\nAt equilibrium, the rate of association is equal to the rate of dissociation. However, a more direct path to the Hill equation involves postulating the relationship for the equilibrium state directly. Let $[D]$ be the concentration of the drug, $[R]$ be the concentration of free receptors, and $[DR_n]$ be the concentration of the complex. The total receptor concentration is $[R_T] = [R] + [DR_n]$.\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_A$, for this cooperative process is defined as:\n$$K_A = \\frac{[D]^n [R]}{[DR_n]}$$\nFrom this, we can express the concentration of free receptors as:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_A [DR_n]}{[D]^n}$$\n\nThe fraction of occupied receptors, $f_{occ}$, is the ratio of the concentration of occupied receptors to the total receptor concentration:\n$$f_{occ} = \\frac{[DR_n]}{[R_T]} = \\frac{[DR_n]}{[R] + [DR_n]}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[R]$ into the denominator:\n$$f_{occ} = \\frac{[DR_n]}{\\frac{K_A [DR_n]}{[D]^n} + [DR_n]}$$\nBy factoring out $[DR_n]$ from the denominator and canceling the term, we obtain:\n$$f_{occ} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_A}{[D]^n} + 1} = \\frac{[D]^n}{K_A + [D]^n}$$\nThis equation is the Hill equation for receptor binding. The constant $K_A$ here represents the drug concentration raised to the power of $n$ that results in $50\\%$ receptor occupancy. To simplify this, it is standard to define a macroscopic dissociation constant, $K_D$, such that $K_A = K_D^n$. This $K_D$ represents the drug concentration that produces half of the maximal response (or occupancy). The equation then becomes:\n$$f_{occ} = \\frac{[D]^n}{K_D^n + [D]^n}$$\n\nThe problem states that the observed pharmacological effect, $E$, is proportional to the fraction of occupied receptors, modulated by a maximum possible effect, $E_{\\max}$. This establishes the relationship:\n$$E = E_{\\max} \\cdot f_{occ}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $f_{occ}$ gives the full concentration-effect relationship:\n$$E = E_{\\max} \\frac{[D]^n}{K_D^n + [D]^n}$$\nIn pharmacological terminology, the drug concentration $[D]$ is denoted by $C$, and the concentration that produces $50\\%$ of the maximal effect, $K_D$, is denoted by $EC_{50}$. With these standard substitutions, we arrive at the sigmoid Emax model:\n$$E(C) = E_{\\max} \\frac{C^n}{EC_{50}^n + C^n}$$\nThis is the required relationship. The parameter $n$ is the Hill slope coefficient, which describes the steepness of the concentration-response curve and is an indicator of cooperativity.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the SBP Reduction**\n\nWe are given the following parameters for the calcium channel blocker:\n- Maximum SBP reduction, $E_{\\max} = 25$ mmHg.\n- Concentration producing half-maximum effect, $EC_{50} = 5$ ng/mL.\n- Hill slope coefficient, $n = 2$.\n- Measured plasma concentration, $C = 4$ ng/mL.\n\nWe use the derived formula to calculate the expected SBP reduction, $E$, at the given concentration $C$.\n$$E = E_{\\max} \\frac{C^n}{EC_{50}^n + C^n}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values into the equation:\n$$E = 25 \\cdot \\frac{4^2}{5^2 + 4^2}$$\nFirst, we compute the powers:\n$$4^2 = 16$$\n$$5^2 = 25$$\nNow, substitute these back into the equation for $E$:\n$$E = 25 \\cdot \\frac{16}{25 + 16}$$\n$$E = 25 \\cdot \\frac{16}{41}$$\n$$E = \\frac{400}{41}$$\nPerforming the division yields:\n$$E \\approx 9.75609756... \\text{ mmHg}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant digits are $9$, $7$, $5$, and $6$. The fifth digit is $0$, so we do not round up the last digit.\n$$E \\approx 9.756 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nThus, the expected reduction in systolic blood pressure at a plasma concentration of $4$ ng/mL is $9.756$ mmHg.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.756}$$", "id": "4577944"}, {"introduction": "Bridging pharmacokinetic theory and clinical practice often involves adjusting drug therapy in response to changes in a patient's physiology.
