The use of fractional excretion of sodium ($FE_{Na}$) to assess renal tubular function and natriuretic response to diuretics is a standard and well-established clinical concept. The provided laboratory values are physiologically plausible for a patient with ADHF and co-existing chronic kidney disease (indicated by the elevated baseline $P_{Cr}$). The scenario is scientifically and clinically realistic.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary definitions and data to derive the required formula and perform the calculations. The question is specific and unambiguous, asking for both the correct formula and its correct clinical interpretation. A unique solution can be determined.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms, free from subjective language or opinion.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions, missing information, or other flaws. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Derivation of the Formula for Fractional Excretion of Sodium ($FE_{Na}$)**\n\nBy definition, the fractional excretion of a substance $x$ ($FE_x$) is the ratio of the rate of its excretion in urine to the rate of its filtration at the glomerulus.\n\n1.  **Rate of Excretion**: The amount of substance $x$ excreted per unit time is the product of its urinary concentration ($U_x$) and the urine flow rate ($V$).\n    $$ \\text{Excretion Rate}_x = U_x \\cdot V $$\n2.  **Rate of Filtration**: The amount of a substance $x$ that is freely filtered at the glomerulus per unit time is the product of its plasma concentration ($P_x$) and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). For sodium, which is freely filtered, this is:\n    $$ \\text{Filtered Load}_{Na} = P_{Na} \\cdot \\text{GFR} $$\n3.  **Fractional Excretion**: Combining these, the fractional excretion of sodium ($FE_{Na}$) is:\n    $$ FE_{Na} = \\frac{\\text{Excretion Rate}_{Na}}{\\text{Filtered Load}_{Na}} = \\frac{U_{Na} \\cdot V}{P_{Na} \\cdot \\text{GFR}} $$\n4.  **Estimating GFR**: The problem states to use creatinine as a surrogate for GFR. The clearance of creatinine ($C_{Cr}$) is used to estimate GFR. From the provided clearance formula, $C_{Cr}$ is:\n    $$ \\text{GFR} \\approx C_{Cr} = \\frac{U_{Cr} \\cdot V}{P_{Cr}} $$\n    Here, $U_{Cr}$ is the urine creatinine concentration and $P_{Cr}$ is the plasma creatinine concentration.\n5.  **Final Formula for $FE_{Na}$**: Substituting the expression for GFR into the $FE_{Na}$ equation:\n    $$ FE_{Na} = \\frac{U_{Na} \\cdot V}{P_{Na} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{U_{Cr} \\cdot V}{P_{Cr}} \\right)} $$\n    The urine flow rate, $V$, appears in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus cancels out. This is a critical point, as it allows for the calculation of $FE_{Na}$ from spot (untimed) urine and plasma samples.\n    $$ FE_{Na} = \\frac{U_{Na}}{P_{Na}} \\cdot \\frac{P_{Cr}}{U_{Cr}} = \\frac{U_{Na} \\cdot P_{Cr}}{P_{Na} \\cdot U_{Cr}} $$\n    This is the correct formula for $FE_{Na}$ using measurable laboratory quantities.\n\n**Calculation of $FE_{Na}$ Values**\n\nUsing the derived formula and the provided data:\n- $P_{Na} = 140\\,\\text{mEq/L}$\n- $P_{Cr} = 2.0\\,\\text{mg/dL}$\n\n1.  **Pre-diuretic $FE_{Na}$**:\n    - $U_{Na} = 20\\,\\text{mEq/L}$\n    - $U_{Cr} = 100\\,\\text{mg/dL}$\n    $$ FE_{Na, \\text{pre}} = \\frac{(20) \\cdot (2.0)}{(140) \\cdot (100)} = \\frac{40}{14000} = \\frac{1}{350} \\approx 0.002857 $$\n    Expressed as a percentage, $FE_{Na, \\text{pre}} \\approx 0.286\\%$.\n\n2.  **Post-diuretic $FE_{Na}$**:\n    - $U_{Na} = 80\\,\\text{mEq/L}$\n    - $U_{Cr} = 80\\,\\text{mg/dL}$\n    $$ FE_{Na, \\text{post}} = \\frac{(80) \\cdot (2.0)}{(140) \\cdot (80)} = \\frac{160}{11200} = \\frac{1}{70} \\approx 0.0142857 $$\n    Expressed as a percentage, $FE_{Na, \\text{post}} \\approx 1.43\\%$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. $FE_{Na}$ equals $\\dfrac{U_{Na}\\cdot P_{Cr}}{P_{Na}\\cdot U_{Cr}}$. With the provided data, the pre-diuretic $FE_{Na}$ is approximately $0.29\\%$, and the post-diuretic $FE_{Na}$ is approximately $1.43\\%$. The rise indicates a measurable natriuretic effect of the loop diuretic; however, because $FE_{Na}$ remains near $1\\%$, this suggests only a moderate response, and dose escalation or combination (for example, with a thiazide) may be warranted if decongestion is inadequate.**\n- **Formula:** The formula $\\dfrac{U_{Na}\\cdot P_{Cr}}{P_{Na}\\cdot U_{Cr}}$ is correct, as derived above.\n- **Calculations:** The calculated values of pre-diuretic $FE_{Na} \\approx 0.29\\%$ (matches $0.286\\%$) and post-diuretic $FE_{Na} \\approx 1.43\\%$ are correct.\n- **Interpretation:** The pre-diuretic $FE_{Na}$ is low ($1\\%$), which is characteristic of a sodium-avid state like ADHF. The post-diuretic $FE_{Na}$ has increased, confirming the diuretic is working. However, a value of $1.43\\%$ is considered a moderate or suboptimal response in the context of ADHF, where a robust natriuresis is desired. Values above $5-10\\%$ are often sought. Therefore, the interpretation that this represents a measurable but moderate response, potentially requiring therapy intensification, is clinically sound and appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. $FE_{Na}$ equals $\\dfrac{P_{Na}\\cdot U_{Cr}}{U_{Na}\\cdot P_{Cr}}$. Using the provided data, the post-diuretic $FE_{Na}$ is approximately $0.70\\%$, which proves diuretic resistance due to proximal tubular injury.**\n- **Formula:** The formula $\\dfrac{P_{Na}\\cdot U_{Cr}}{U_{Na}\\cdot P_{Cr}}$ is the reciprocal of the correct formula for $FE_{Na}$.\n- **Calculations:** The formula is incorrect. Furthermore, using this incorrect formula, the calculation would be $\\frac{(140) \\cdot (80)}{(80) \\cdot (2.0)} = \\frac{140}{2.0} = 70$. The stated value of $0.70\\%$ (or $0.007$) does not follow from the provided formula. The value $0.70$ is approximately the reciprocal of the correct post-diuretic $FE_{Na}$ percentage ($1/1.43 \\approx 0.699$). The option is mathematically inconsistent.\n- **Interpretation:** The claim that this \"proves\" proximal tubular injury is an overstatement and a non sequitur.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $FE_{Na}$ cannot be applied after loop diuretics because sodium handling is altered; the correct index is fractional excretion of urea ($FE_{Urea}$), so any post-diuretic $FE_{Na}$ should be ignored when assessing diuretic response.**\n- **Rationale:** This statement is fundamentally flawed. The entire purpose of measuring $FE_{Na}$ after a diuretic is to quantify the pharmacodynamic response, i.e., the magnitude of the alteration in sodium handling. While a diuretic-induced increase in $FE_{Na}$ can complicate the differential diagnosis of acute kidney injury (for which $FE_{Urea}$ is a useful alternative), $FE_{Na}$ is the most direct and logical metric for assessing natriuretic effect. Ignoring it would mean ignoring the primary therapeutic effect of the drug.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $FE_{Na}$ equals $\\dfrac{U_{Na}}{P_{Na}}$. With the provided data, the post-diuretic $FE_{Na}$ is approximately $0.57$, indicating excellent natriuresis that obviates further titration.**\n- **Formula:** The formula $\\dfrac{U_{Na}}{P_{Na}}$ is not the fractional excretion of sodium. It is a simple ratio that does not account for the reabsorption of water, which concentrates the urine. The creatinine ratio is necessary to correct for this.\n- **Calculations:** The calculation $\\dfrac{80}{140} \\approx 0.57$ is correct for the given flawed formula.\n- **Interpretation:** An $FE_{Na}$ of $1.43\\%$ is a moderate, not \"excellent,\" response. This interpretation is not clinically appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. $FE_{Na}$ requires the urine flow rate $V$ and cannot be computed from spot plasma and urine without $V$, so the provided information is insufficient to assess diuretic response.**\n- **Rationale:** As demonstrated in the derivation, when creatinine clearance is used to estimate GFR, the urine flow rate term $V$ cancels out of the final equation for $FE_{Na}$. Therefore, $FE_{Na}$ can be, and routinely is, calculated from spot urine and plasma samples. The premise of this option is false.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4532269"}, {"introduction": "When a patient shows a suboptimal response to a diuretic, it is crucial to understand the underlying mechanism of resistance. This exercise introduces the Hill equation as a pharmacodynamic model to distinguish between a loss of drug potency (a higher $EC_{50}$) and a reduction in maximal effect (a lower $E_{max}$). By analyzing hypothetical clinical data, you will learn how to diagnose the nature of diuretic resistance, which is essential for choosing the correct therapeutic strategy [@problem_id:4532289].", "problem": "A loop diuretic produces natriuresis that can be modeled by the Hill equation $E = E_{\\max}\\cdot \\dfrac{C^n}{EC_{50}^n + C^n}$, where $E$ is the urinary sodium excretion rate in $\\mathrm{mmol/h}$, $C$ is the intraluminal drug concentration at the site of the target transporter, $E_{\\max}$ is the maximal attainable natriuretic effect, $EC_{50}$ is the concentration producing half-maximal effect, and $n$ is the Hill coefficient reflecting sigmoidicity. In clinical pharmacology, diuretic resistance is often operationalized as a rightward shift in the concentration-effect curve (higher $EC_{50}$), whereas nephron remodeling (for example, distal nephron hypertrophy with upregulated sodium reabsorption or fewer functioning nephrons) is associated with a lower ceiling of response (lower $E_{\\max}$).\n\nConsider a patient with congestive heart failure (CHF) receiving a loop diuretic. Under baseline conditions, the patient’s pharmacodynamic parameters were $E_{\\max} = 120\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$, $EC_{50} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, and $n=2$. After several weeks of high-dose diuretic therapy, two distinct response profiles are observed in separate admissions, each measured at three intraluminal concentrations $C$ achieved by varying dose and infusion strategy:\n\nProfile $X$: $E(C=10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\approx 3.2\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$, $E(C=40\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\approx 36.9\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$, $E(C=200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\approx 110.1\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$.\n\nProfile $Y$: $E(C=10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\approx 14.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$, $E(C=40\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\approx 56.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$, $E(C=200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\approx 69.3\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$.\n\nUsing only the Hill equation and first-principles reasoning (limits as $C\\to\\infty$, sensitivity to parameter changes, and monotonicity), determine which parameter change best explains each profile and select the most mechanistically coherent clinical adjustment. Assume $C$ denotes the concentration at the transporter in the tubular lumen and that factors such as reduced Organic Anion Transporter (OAT) secretion, increased luminal albumin binding, and Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) use lower $C$ for a given dose, while structural and functional nephron adaptations lower $E_{\\max}$.\n\nWhich option most accurately interprets these profiles and recommends appropriate strategies?\n\nA. Profile $X$ is best explained by increased $EC_{50}$ with unchanged $E_{\\max}$ (diuretic resistance due to reduced delivery to the site of action).

The mechanisms described (diuretic resistance, nephron remodeling) are medically accurate. All premises are sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a governing equation, initial parameters, and new data sets.

It is free from subjective or opinion-based claims.\n- **Conclusion:** The problem is valid, self-contained, and scientifically sound. It is an excellent example of applying quantitative principles to a clinical scenario.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Option Evaluation\nThe problem is valid. We can proceed with the solution.\n\n**Baseline Response Calculation**\nFirst, we establish the expected natriuretic effect, $E$, for the baseline parameters at the given concentrations. The baseline model is:\n$$E_{\\text{base}}(C) = 120 \\cdot \\frac{C^2}{20^2 + C^2} = 120 \\cdot \\frac{C^2}{400 + C^2}$$\n- For $C = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$: $E_{\\text{base}}(10) = 120 \\cdot \\frac{10^2}{400 + 10^2} = 120 \\cdot \\frac{100}{500} = 24\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$.\n- For $C = 40\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$: $E_{\\text{base}}(40) = 120 \\cdot \\frac{40^2}{400 + 40^2} = 120 \\cdot \\frac{1600}{2000} = 96\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$.\n- For $C = 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$: $E_{\\text{base}}(200) = 120 \\cdot \\frac{200^2}{400 + 200^2} = 120 \\cdot \\frac{40000}{40400} \\approx 118.8\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$.\n\n**Analysis of Profile X**\n- Data: $E(10) \\approx 3.2$, $E(40) \\approx 36.9$, $E(200) \\approx 110.1$.\n- Comparison: The effects at $C=10$ and $C=40$ are significantly lower than baseline ($3.2$ vs $24$ and $36.9$ vs $96$). However, the effect at the high concentration of $C=200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ ($110.1\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$) is very close to the baseline $E_{\\max}$ of $120\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$.\n- Interpretation: The limit of the Hill equation as $C \\to \\infty$ is $E_{\\max}$. Since the response at high $C$ approaches the original $E_{\\max}$, it is highly probable that $E_{\\max}$ is unchanged. The decreased response at lower concentrations indicates a rightward shift of the dose-response curve, which corresponds to an increased $EC_{50}$.\n- Hypothesis Test: Assume $E_{\\max} = 120\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$ and $n=2$, and calculate the new $EC_{50,X}$.\nUsing the data point $E(40) = 36.9\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$:\n$$36.9 = 120 \\cdot \\frac{40^2}{EC_{50,X}^2 + 40^2}$$\n$$\\frac{36.9}{120} = 0.3075 = \\frac{1600}{EC_{50,X}^2 + 1600}$$\n$$EC_{50,X}^2 + 1600 = \\frac{1600}{0.3075} \\approx 5203.25$$\n$$EC_{50,X}^2 \\approx 3603.25 \\implies EC_{50,X} \\approx 60.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nLet's verify this new model ($E_{\\max}=120$, $EC_{50}=60$, $n=2$) with the other data points:\n- $E(10) = 120 \\cdot \\frac{10^2}{60^2 + 10^2} = 120 \\cdot \\frac{100}{3700} \\approx 3.24\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$. This matches the observed value of $3.2$.\n- $E(200) = 120 \\cdot \\frac{200^2}{60^2 + 200^2} = 120 \\cdot \\frac{40000}{43600} \\approx 110.09\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$. This matches the observed value of $110.1$.\n- Conclusion for Profile X: The data are precisely described by an increase in $EC_{50}$ from $20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to approximately $60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, with $E_{\\max}$ unchanged. This represents diuretic resistance. The rational therapeutic strategy is to increase the luminal drug concentration $C$ to overcome the rightward shift, which can be achieved by increasing the diuretic dose or using a continuous infusion.\n\n**Analysis of Profile Y**\n- Data: $E(10) \\approx 14.0$, $E(40) \\approx 56.0$, $E(200) \\approx 69.3$.\n- Comparison: The effect is lower than baseline at all concentrations. Critically, even at a very high concentration of $C=200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, the response ($69.3\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$) is far below the original $E_{\\max}$ of $120\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$.\n- Interpretation: The fact that the response plateaus at a value significantly lower than the original $E_{\\max}$ is strong evidence for a reduction in $E_{\\max}$ itself. This corresponds to a lower ceiling of response, as seen in nephron remodeling or loss of functional nephrons.\n- Hypothesis Test: Assume $EC_{50} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $n=2$ are unchanged, and calculate the new $E_{\\max,Y}$.\nThe term $\\frac{C^n}{EC_{50}^n + C^n}$ remains the same as in the baseline. We can use any data point to find $E_{\\max,Y}$. Using $C=10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, where the fractional effect is $\\frac{10^2}{20^2+10^2} = \\frac{100}{500} = 0.2$:\n$$14.0 = E_{\\max,Y} \\cdot 0.2 \\implies E_{\\max,Y} = \\frac{14.0}{0.2} = 70\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$$\nLet's verify this new model ($E_{\\max}=70$, $EC_{50}=20$, $n=2$) with the other data points:\n- $E(40) = 70 \\cdot \\frac{40^2}{20^2 + 40^2} = 70 \\cdot \\frac{1600}{2000} = 70 \\cdot 0.8 = 56.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$. This perfectly matches the observed value.\n- $E(200) = 70 \\cdot \\frac{200^2}{20^2 + 200^2} = 70 \\cdot \\frac{40000}{40400} \\approx 70 \\cdot 0.9901 \\approx 69.3\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$. This perfectly matches the observed value.\n- Conclusion for Profile Y: The data are perfectly described by a decrease in $E_{\\max}$ from $120\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$ to $70\\,\\mathrm{mmol/h}$, with $EC_{50}$ unchanged. This is a ceiling effect. Increasing the dose of the loop diuretic will yield diminishing returns, as the response is already close to its new, lower maximum. The mechanistic cause is often hypertrophy and increased sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule. The rational strategy is to add a second diuretic that acts at this distal site, such as a thiazide, to achieve \"sequential nephron blockade\".\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Profile $X$ is best explained by increased $EC_{50}$ with unchanged $E_{\\max}$ (diuretic resistance due to reduced delivery to the site of action). Profile $Y$ is best explained by decreased $E_{\\max}$ with unchanged $EC_{50}$ (capacity-limited nephron remodeling). For $X$, increasing dose or using continuous infusion to raise $C$ is rational; for $Y$, adding a distal-acting diuretic (for example, a thiazide) for sequential nephron blockade is rational.**\n- This option's interpretation for Profile X (increased $EC_{50}$, unchanged $E_{\\max}$) and Profile Y (decreased $E_{\\max}$, unchanged $EC_{50}$) exactly matches our derivation. The proposed clinical strategies for both profiles are mechanistically sound and represent standard of care.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Profile $X$ is best explained by decreased $E_{\\max}$, and Profile $Y$ by increased $EC_{50}$. For $X$, raise the loop diuretic dose; for $Y$, add a thiazide.**\n- The interpretation of the profiles is inverted and factually incorrect based on our analysis. Profile X's data approach the original $E_{\\max}$, and Profile Y's data show a clear ceiling effect far below the original $E_{\\max}$.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Profile $X$ is best explained by increased $EC_{50}$ with decreased Hill coefficient $n$, while Profile $Y$ shows unchanged $E_{\\max}$. For $Y$, use a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor; for $X$, the plateau cannot be reached even at high $C$.**\n- This option contains multiple errors. The claim that Profile Y has an unchanged $E_{\\max}$ is false. The claim that the plateau for Profile X cannot be reached is false; the data at $C=200$ is close to the plateau. The recommendation to use a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (a proximal diuretic) for a distal compensatory mechanism is mechanistically incorrect. Introducing a change in $n$ is an unnecessary complication as the data fit perfectly with $n=2$.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Both profiles reflect measurement noise; the Hill equation cannot distinguish changes in $EC_{50}$ from changes in $E_{\\max}$. The appropriate adjustment is to maintain the same regimen and reassess later.**\n- This option is fundamentally flawed. Our analysis demonstrates that the Hill equation can and does distinguish between these parameter changes, as they affect the curve's shape differently (horizontal shift vs. vertical scaling). The data are not noise; they fit perfectly to specific, meaningful models. Recommending no change in therapy would be clinically inappropriate.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4532289"}, {"introduction": "After identifying diuretic resistance characterized by decreased potency (an increased $EC_{50}$), the next step is to design a dosing regimen to overcome it. This practice applies core pharmacokinetic principles to a common clinical solution: the use of continuous intravenous infusion to achieve a sustained, high drug concentration at the target. You will calculate the precise infusion rate required to attain a target unbound drug concentration, translating pharmacodynamic insight into a quantitative therapeutic plan [@problem_id:4532273].", "problem": "A patient with acute decompensated heart failure is receiving a loop diuretic by intravenous continuous infusion to overcome diuretic resistance. Prior noncompartmental analysis of an intravenous bolus dose in this same patient yielded a measured systemic clearance of the diuretic of $1.2 \\ \\mathrm{L/h}$. The loop diuretic is highly protein bound in plasma with an unbound fraction $f_{u} = 0.03$. To ensure sufficient delivery to the proximal tubular Organic Anion Transporters (OATs), the clinical team decides to target a steady-state unbound plasma concentration of $C_{u,ss} = 0.50 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$ under the assumption that clearance remains time-invariant over the intended infusion period.\n\nUsing only core pharmacokinetic definitions of clearance and the mass balance condition at steady state, determine the constant intravenous infusion rate $R_{in}$ that will achieve the specified steady-state unbound plasma concentration. Express your final infusion rate in $\\mathrm{mg/h}$ and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is first validated against the established criteria.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Measured systemic clearance of the diuretic, $CL = 1.2 \\ \\mathrm{L/h}$.\n- Unbound fraction of the diuretic in plasma, $f_{u} = 0.03$.\n- Target steady-state unbound plasma concentration, $C_{u,ss} = 0.50 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n- The drug is administered via a constant intravenous infusion.\n- The system is assumed to be at steady state ($ss$).\n- Clearance is assumed to be time-invariant.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on fundamental principles of clinical pharmacokinetics, specifically the concept of steady state achieved during a constant intravenous infusion. The relationship between clearance, infusion rate, and steady-state concentration is a cornerstone of this field. The provided values for clearance, protein binding, and target concentration are pharmacologically plausible for a loop diuretic in a patient with heart failure. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary information to determine the infusion rate, and contains no internal contradictions or ambiguities. It is a formalizable and standard problem in quantitative pharmacology.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Solution**\nThe core principle governing a constant intravenous infusion at steady state is the mass balance condition: the rate of drug entering the body must equal the rate of drug elimination from the body.\n\nThe rate of drug administration for a constant intravenous infusion is the infusion rate, denoted as $R_{in}$.\n\nThe rate of drug elimination from the systemic circulation is defined by the product of the total systemic clearance ($CL$) and the total plasma drug concentration at steady state ($C_{ss}$).\n$$ \\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL \\times C_{ss} $$\n\nEquating the rate of administration and the rate of elimination at steady state yields the fundamental equation:\n$$ R_{in} = CL \\times C_{ss} $$\n\nThe problem provides the target *unbound* plasma concentration at steady state, $C_{u,ss}$, not the total concentration, $C_{ss}$. The total concentration is related to the unbound concentration and the fraction unbound, $f_u$, by the definition:\n$$ C_{u,ss} = C_{ss} \\times f_u $$\n\nTo use the given information, we must express the total steady-state concentration, $C_{ss}$, in terms of the unbound concentration, $C_{u,ss}$, and the unbound fraction, $f_u$. Rearranging the above equation gives:\n$$ C_{ss} = \\frac{C_{u,ss}}{f_u} $$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $C_{ss}$ back into the steady-state mass balance equation:\n$$ R_{in} = CL \\times \\left( \\frac{C_{u,ss}}{f_u} \\right) $$\n\nThis equation allows for the direct calculation of the required infusion rate, $R_{in}$, using the provided parameters. The given values are:\n- $CL = 1.2 \\ \\mathrm{L/h}$\n- $C_{u,ss} = 0.50 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$\n- $f_u = 0.03$ (dimensionless)\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$ R_{in} = (1.2 \\ \\mathrm{L/h}) \\times \\frac{0.50 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L}}{0.03} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the quotient within the parentheses:\n$$ \\frac{0.50 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L}}{0.03} \\approx 16.666... \\ \\mathrm{mg/L} $$\nThis intermediate value represents the total steady-state plasma concentration, $C_{ss}$, required to achieve the target unbound concentration.\n\nNext, we multiply this total concentration by the clearance to find the infusion rate:\n$$ R_{in} = 1.2 \\ \\mathrm{L/h} \\times 16.666... \\ \\mathrm{mg/L} $$\n$$ R_{in} = 20.0 \\ \\mathrm{mg/h} $$\n\nThe units are consistent: $(\\mathrm{L/h}) \\times (\\mathrm{mg/L}) = \\mathrm{mg/h}$, which is the required unit for an infusion rate. The problem specifies rounding to three significant figures. The calculated value is $20.0 \\ \\mathrm{mg/h}$, which is already expressed to three significant figures.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{20.0}\n$$", "id": "4532273"}]}
