It is based on established principles of clinical pharmacology and antiretroviral therapy, provides all necessary data for a unique solution, and is free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nThe primary task is to calculate the inhibitory quotient ($IQ$) for a patient undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART). The inhibitory quotient is a fundamental pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index used to predict the effectiveness of an antimicrobial or antiviral agent. It relates the concentration of a drug achieved in a patient's body to the concentration of the drug required to inhibit the replication of the target pathogen.\n\nThe standard definition of the inhibitory quotient, particularly for assessing the efficacy of protease inhibitors in HIV therapy, is the ratio of the trough plasma concentration ($C_{\\min}$) to the $50\\%$ inhibitory concentration ($IC_{50}$). The trough concentration is the lowest drug concentration observed over a dosing interval, representing the time of maximum vulnerability to viral replication. Therefore, it is the most conservative and clinically relevant concentration for this calculation.\n\nThe formula for the inhibitory quotient is:\n$$\nIQ = \\frac{C_{\\min}}{IC_{50}}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n1.  The trough plasma concentration of atazanavir at steady state: $C_{\\min} = 260\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$.\n2.  The protein-adjusted $50\\%$ inhibitory concentration of atazanavir against the patient's specific viral isolate: $IC_{50} = 3.20\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$.\n\nA critical detail is that the $IC_{50}$ was determined in the presence of $50\\%$ human serum. This \"protein-adjusted\" $IC_{50}$ accounts for the reduction in antiviral activity caused by the drug binding to plasma proteins (like albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein). Because the effect of protein binding is already incorporated into the $IC_{50}$ value, it is appropriate to use the total trough plasma concentration ($C_{\\min}$) directly in the numerator. If a non-protein-adjusted $IC_{50}$ were provided, one would need to use the unbound or \"free\" drug concentration in the numerator, which would require knowledge of the fraction of drug bound to plasma proteins. The problem setup correctly provides the necessary, clinically relevant parameters for a direct calculation.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$\nIQ = \\frac{260\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}}{3.20\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}}\n$$\nNote that the units ($\\mathrm{ng/mL}$) cancel, rendering the $IQ$ a dimensionless quantity.\n$$\nIQ = 81.25\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The input value $3.20$ has three significant figures. The input value $260$ is ambiguous, but in the context of clinical measurements, it is reasonable to treat it as having three significant figures ($260.$). The result of the division, $81.25$, has four significant figures. Rounding to three significant figures gives:\n$$\nIQ \\approx 81.3\n$$\n\nThe final part of the task is to interpret this result in the context of the provided institutional pharmacodynamic targets.\nThe calculated $IQ$ is $81.3$.\n\n1.  **Comparison to the target for wild-type virus:**\n    The target threshold is $15$. The patient's $IQ$ of $81.3$ is substantially above this target. To quantify this margin, we can calculate the ratio:\n    $$\n    \\text{Margin}_{\\text{wild-type}} = \\frac{81.25}{15} \\approx 5.417\n    $$\n    The patient's inhibitory quotient is approximately $5.42$-fold higher than the target threshold for viruses without major resistance mutations. This indicates a very high likelihood of therapeutic success if the virus is wild-type.\n\n2.  **Comparison to the target for resistant virus:**\n    The target threshold for viruses with established major protease inhibitor resistance mutations is $60$. The patient's $IQ$ of $81.3$ is also above this more stringent target. The margin is:\n    $$\n    \\text{Margin}_{\\text{resistant}} = \\frac{81.25}{60} \\approx 1.354\n    $$\n    The patient's inhibitory quotient is approximately $1.35$-fold higher than the target threshold for resistant viruses. This suggests that the current atazanavir/ritonavir regimen provides an exposure level that is likely sufficient to suppress even viral strains that have developed some degree of resistance to protease inhibitors.

The core question addresses a fundamental principle in clinical virology: the pre-existence of drug-resistant variants, which dictates the necessity of combination therapy. We shall proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe problem asks for two probabilities related to the pre-existence of drug-resistant HIV genomes at baseline. The scenario involves a large number of independent events (viral replications) where the event of interest (a specific mutation) has a very small probability. This constitutes a classic application of the Poisson distribution as an approximation to the binomial distribution.\n\n**1. Probability of single-drug resistance**\n\nLet $N$ be the number of independent viral genome replication events, given as $N = 10^7$.\nLet $p$ be the per-target-site probability of a specific point mutation per replication, given as $p = 3 \\times 10^{-5}$.\nLet the random variable $X$ represent the number of genomes carrying this specific mutation within the population of $N$ genomes.\n\nFrom first principles, each replication is an independent Bernoulli trial with a probability of \"success\" (mutation) equal to $p$. Therefore, the exact distribution of $X$ is binomial:\n$$X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, p)$$\nThe probability of observing exactly $k$ mutant genomes is given by the probability mass function:\n$$P(X=k) = \\binom{N}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N-k}$$\nThe problem asks for the probability that at least one such genome exists, which is $P(X \\ge 1)$.

The conditions for a Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution are met here:\n- The number of trials $N$ is very large ($N = 10^7$).\n- The probability of success $p$ is very small ($p = 3 \\times 10^{-5}$).\n- The expected number of mutant genomes, $\\lambda = Np$, is a finite constant.\n\nWe calculate the parameter $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = Np = (10^7) \\times (3 \\times 10^{-5}) = 300$$\nSince these conditions are satisfied, the binomial distribution can be accurately approximated by a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda = 300$.\n$$X \\approx \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda=300)$$\nThe probability mass function for the Poisson distribution is:\n$$P(X=k) \\approx \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nWe need to calculate the probability of at least one resistant genome, $P(X \\ge 1)$.
