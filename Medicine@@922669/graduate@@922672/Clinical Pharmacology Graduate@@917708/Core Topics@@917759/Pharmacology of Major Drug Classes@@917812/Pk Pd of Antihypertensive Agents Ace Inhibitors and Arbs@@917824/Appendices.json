Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) catalyzes the conversion of Angiotensin I (Ang I) to Ang II, and Ang II is eliminated by downstream processes that, at the pharmacodynamic (PD) level, can be lumped into a first-order loss. Consider an indirect response model for Ang II in which the production (input) term is driven by ACE catalysis and the loss (output) term is linear in Ang II concentration. Assume the following foundational bases:\n\n- At the PD level, Ang II dynamics can be represented by a production–loss form, with production proportional to the active ACE catalytic rate constant and loss represented by a first-order rate constant.\n- The pharmacological inhibition of ACE by an ACE inhibitor with plasma concentration $C$ can be described by a standard inhibitory maximal-effect model with $I_{\\max} = 1$, that is, the inhibitory effect (fractional inhibition) is $I = \\frac{C}{IC_{50} + C}$, where $IC_{50}$ is the inhibitor concentration that produces one-half of maximal inhibition.\n- The fraction of active enzyme is reduced by the fractional inhibition $I$, so the fraction of active ACE catalytic capacity is $1 - I$.\n\nStarting from these bases, derive the indirect response differential equation for Ang II concentration, explicitly showing how the effective ACE catalytic rate constant enters the production term via the factor $1 - I$. Then, define the fractional reduction in Ang II formation rate relative to baseline as the ratio of the decrease in the production term to the baseline production term, and compute this fractional reduction for an ACE inhibitor with concentration $C = 53 \\text{ nM}$ and $IC_{50} = 12 \\text{ nM}$. Express the fractional reduction as a decimal fraction, and round your answer to four significant figures. No units should be included in the final reported value.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an indirect response model for Angiotensin II (Ang II) dynamics under the influence of an ACE inhibitor, and the calculation of the fractional reduction in Ang II formation for a given inhibitor concentration.\n\nLet the concentration of Angiotensin II be denoted by the variable $A_{II}$. The dynamics of $A_{II}$ are described by a production-loss differential equation of the general form:\n$$\n\\frac{dA_{II}}{dt} = \\text{Production Rate} - \\text{Loss Rate}\n$$\nThe problem states that the loss of Ang II is a first-order process. Therefore, the loss rate is proportional to the current concentration of Ang II, which can be written as $k_{out} A_{II}$, where $k_{out}$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\nThe production of Ang II is catalyzed by the enzyme ACE. The production rate, which we denote as $k_{in}$, is proportional to the active ACE catalytic capacity. In the absence of any inhibitor (at baseline), the production rate is a constant, $k_{in,0}$.\n\nThe ACE inhibitor, with plasma concentration $C$, reduces the activity of the ACE enzyme. The fractional inhibition, $I$, is described by a standard maximal-effect model with $I_{\\max} = 1$:\n$$\nI = \\frac{C}{IC_{50} + C}\n$$\nwhere $IC_{50}$ is the inhibitor concentration that produces $50\\%$ of the maximal inhibition.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the fraction of active ACE catalytic capacity is $(1 - I)$. Since the production rate of Ang II is proportional to the active ACE capacity, the production rate in the presence of the inhibitor, $k_{in}(C)$, is the baseline production rate $k_{in,0}$ multiplied by this active fraction:\n$$\nk_{in}(C) = k_{in,0} (1 - I)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I$, we explicitly show how the production term is modulated by the inhibitor:\n$$\nk_{in}(C) = k_{in,0} \\left(1 - \\frac{C}{IC_{50} + C}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{C}{IC_{50} + C} = \\frac{(IC_{50} + C) - C}{IC_{50} + C} = \\frac{IC_{50}}{IC_{50} + C}\n$$\nSo, the effective production rate is $k_{in}(C) = k_{in,0} \\frac{IC_{50}}{IC_{50} + C}$.\n\nCombining the derived production term and the given loss term, the complete indirect response differential equation for Ang II concentration is:\n$$\n\\frac{dA_{II}}{dt} = k_{in,0} (1 - I) - k_{out} A_{II}\n$$\nor, written explicitly in terms of $C$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA_{II}}{dt} = k_{in,0} \\left(\\frac{IC_{50}}{IC_{50} + C}\\right) - k_{out} A_{II}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nNext, we must define and compute the fractional reduction in Ang II formation rate relative to baseline. The problem defines this quantity as the ratio of the decrease in the production term to the baseline production term.\n\nThe baseline production term corresponds to the inhibitor concentration $C=0$. At $C=0$, the fractional inhibition $I=0$, so the baseline production rate is $k_{in}(0) = k_{in,0}(1-0) = k_{in,0}$.\n\nThe production term in the presence of the inhibitor at concentration $C$ is $k_{in}(C) = k_{in,0}(1-I)$.\n\nThe decrease in the production term is the difference between the baseline rate and the inhibited rate:\n$$\n\\text{Decrease} = k_{in,0} - k_{in}(C) = k_{in,0} - k_{in,0}(1-I) = k_{in,0} - k_{in,0} + k_{in,0}I = k_{in,0}I\n$$\nThe fractional reduction ($FR$) is therefore:\n$$\nFR = \\frac{\\text{Decrease}}{\\text{Baseline Production}} = \\frac{k_{in,0}I}{k_{in,0}} = I\n$$\nThis shows that the fractional reduction in the Ang II formation rate is identical to the fractional inhibition, $I$.\n\nFinally, we compute this value using the given data: $C = 53 \\text{ nM}$ and $IC_{50} = 12 \\text{ nM}$.\n$$\nFR = I = \\frac{C}{IC_{50} + C} = \\frac{53}{12 + 53} = \\frac{53}{65}\n$$\nPerforming the division to obtain a decimal fraction:\n$$\nFR = \\frac{53}{65} \\approx 0.8153846...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Letting $x = k_{el}\\tau$, this is proportional to $\\frac{x}{\\exp(x)-1}$. Mathematical analysis shows this function is strictly decreasing for $x>0$. Therefore, as the dosing interval $\\tau$ decreases (while keeping daily dose constant), the value of $x=k_{el}\\tau$ decreases, and consequently the trough concentration $C_{\\min,ss}$ increases.\n\nOur calculation confirms this: switching from a $24$-hour interval (Regimen A) to a $12$-hour interval (Regimen B) while halving the dose increased the trough concentration by a factor of approximately $2.16$. This regimen change leads to lower peak-to-trough fluctuation. For an antihypertensive agent, a higher trough concentration implies a more sustained pharmacologic effect, ensuring that blood pressure remains controlled throughout the entire dosing interval, especially during the vulnerable early morning hours before the next dose.

We must first find the required free concentration of the ARB, $C_{\\mathrm{avg,free,ARB}}$, by rearranging the $E_{\\max}$ model equation:\n$E_{\\mathrm{ARB}} \\times (EC_{50,\\mathrm{ARB}} + C_{\\mathrm{avg,free,ARB}}) = E_{\\max,\\mathrm{ARB}} \\times C_{\\mathrm{avg,free,ARB}}$\n$E_{\\mathrm{ARB}} \\times EC_{50,\\mathrm{ARB}} = (E_{\\max,\\mathrm{ARB}} - E_{\\mathrm{ARB}}) \\times C_{\\mathrm{avg,free,ARB}}$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{avg,free,ARB}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{ARB}} \\times EC_{50,\\mathrm{ARB}}}{E_{\\max,\\mathrm{ARB}} - E_{\\mathrm{ARB}}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{avg,free,ARB}} = \\frac{\\frac{125}{11} \\times 0.006}{22 - \\frac{125}{11}} = \\frac{\\frac{125}{11} \\times \\frac{6}{1000}}{\\frac{242-125}{11}} = \\frac{\\frac{750}{11000}}{\\frac{117}{11}} = \\frac{750}{11000} \\times \\frac{11}{117} = \\frac{750}{1000 \\times 117} = \\frac{75}{11700} = \\frac{1}{156}\\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot L^{-1}}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the required total concentration of the ARB:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{avg,total,ARB}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{avg,free,ARB}}}{f_{u,\\mathrm{ARB}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{156}\\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot L^{-1}}}{0.05} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{156}}{\\frac{1}{20}}\\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot L^{-1}} = \\frac{20}{156}\\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot L^{-1}} = \\frac{5}{39}\\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot L^{-1}}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the required oral dose, $D_{\\mathrm{ARB}}$, by rearranging the steady-state concentration formula:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{ARB}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{avg,total,ARB}} \\times CL_{\\mathrm{ARB}} \\times \\tau}{F_{\\mathrm{ARB}}}$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{ARB}} = \\frac{(\\frac{5}{39}\\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot L^{-1}}) \\times (2.5\\ \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}}) \\times (24\\ \\mathrm{h})}{0.4} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{39} \\times 60}{0.4}\\ \\mathrm{mg} = \\frac{\\frac{300}{39}}{0.4}\\ \\mathrm{mg} = \\frac{300}{39 \\times 0.4}\\ \\mathrm{mg} = \\frac{300}{15.6}\\ \\mathrm{mg} = \\frac{3000}{156}\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{ARB}} = \\frac{3000 \\div 12}{156 \\div 12}\\ \\mathrm{mg} = \\frac{250}{13}\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nAs a decimal, this is $D_{\\mathrm{ARB}} \\approx 19.230769...\\ \\mathrm{mg}$. The problem requires rounding the final answer to three significant figures.\n$$D_{\\mathrm{ARB}} \\approx 19.2\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{19.2}$$", "id": "4577471"}]}
