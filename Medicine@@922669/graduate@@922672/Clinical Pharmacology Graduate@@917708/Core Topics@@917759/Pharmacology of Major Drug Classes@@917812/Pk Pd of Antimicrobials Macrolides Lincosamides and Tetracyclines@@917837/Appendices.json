By applying this to a common clindamycin regimen, you will not only calculate a key exposure metric but also interpret its clinical relevance, considering crucial factors like protein binding that bridge the gap between plasma concentration and antimicrobial effect [@problem_id:4578744].", "problem": "An adult patient is being treated for a complicated skin and soft tissue infection with oral clindamycin, a lincosamide antibiotic. The regimen is $600$ mg every $8$ h. Assume linear, time-invariant pharmacokinetics with immediate-release oral dosing, absolute oral bioavailability $F = 0.90$, and systemic clearance $Cl = 12$ L/h.

The data provided for dose, bioavailability, and clearance are pharmacologically plausible for clindamycin. The tasks of deriving an expression, calculating its value, and providing a clinical interpretation are standard procedures in this field.\n\nThe first step is to derive the expression for the average plasma concentration at steady state, $C_{\\mathrm{avg,ss}}$, using only the provided foundational principles.\n\n1.  **Definition of Average Concentration:** The average concentration over a single dosing interval, $\\tau$, at steady state is defined as the time-integral of the concentration profile, $C_{ss}(t)$, over that interval, divided by the duration of the interval.\n    $$C_{\\mathrm{avg,ss}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\int_{0}^{\\tau} C_{ss}(t) dt$$\n    The integral term, $\\int_{0}^{\\tau} C_{ss}(t) dt$, is by definition the Area Under the concentration-time Curve over one dosing interval at steady state, denoted $\\text{AUC}_{\\tau,ss}$. Thus, the equation can be rewritten as:\n    $$C_{\\mathrm{avg,ss}} = \\frac{\\text{AUC}_{\\tau,ss}}{\\tau}$$\n\n2.  **Principle of Steady State and Definition of Clearance:** At pharmacokinetic steady state under a periodic dosing regimen, the system is in equilibrium. This means that the amount of drug that enters the systemic circulation during one dosing interval must be equal to the amount of drug that is eliminated from the body during that same interval.\n    \n    The amount of drug entering the systemic circulation from a single oral dose is the dose ($Dose$) multiplied by the absolute oral bioavailability ($F$). So, for one dosing interval:\n    $$Amount\\ In = F \\cdot Dose$$\n    The rate of drug elimination for a linear system is given by the product of the systemic clearance ($Cl$) and the plasma concentration at that time, $C(t)$. The total amount of drug eliminated over the dosing interval $\\tau$ at steady state is the integral of this rate over the interval:\n    $$Amount\\ Out = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} Cl \\cdot C_{ss}(t) dt$$\n    Since clearance ($Cl$) is assumed to be constant (a feature of a linear, time-invariant system), it can be moved outside the integral:\n    $$Amount\\ Out = Cl \\int_{0}^{\\tau} C_{ss}(t) dt = Cl \\cdot \\text{AUC}_{\\tau,ss}$$\n    This step relates the amount eliminated to the clearance ($Cl$) and the $AUC$ over the interval, consistent with the foundational definition of clearance.\n\n3.  **Derivation of the Final Expression:** By equating the amount of drug in and out over the interval, we establish the steady-state condition:\n    $$Amount\\ In = Amount\\ Out$$\n    $$F \\cdot Dose = Cl \\cdot \\text{AUC}_{\\tau,ss}$$\n    This equation can be rearranged to solve for $\\text{AUC}_{\\tau,ss}$:\n    $$\\text{AUC}_{\\tau,ss} = \\frac{F \\cdot Dose}{Cl}$$\n    Finally, we substitute this expression for $\\text{AUC}_{\\tau,ss}$ back into our initial equation for $C_{\\mathrm{avg,ss}}$:\n    $$C_{\\mathrm{avg,ss}} = \\frac{\\text{AUC}_{\\tau,ss}}{\\tau} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{F \\cdot Dose}{Cl} \\right)}{\\tau}$$\n    This simplifies to the desired expression for the average steady-state concentration:\n    $$C_{\\mathrm{avg,ss}} = \\frac{F \\cdot Dose}{Cl \\cdot \\tau}$$\n    This derivation successfully uses only the three foundational elements stipulated in the problem.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for the given regimen. The provided parameters are:\n-   $Dose = 600$ mg\n-   $\\tau = 8$ h\n-   $F = 0.90$ (dimensionless)\n-   $Cl = 12$ L/h\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{avg,ss}} = \\frac{0.90 \\cdot 600 \\text{ mg}}{(12 \\text{ L/h}) \\cdot (8 \\text{ h})} = \\frac{540 \\text{ mg}}{96 \\text{ L}} = 5.625 \\text{ mg/L}$$\nThe problem requests the answer rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $5.625$ already has four significant figures.\n\nFinally, we provide a brief clinical interpretation.\nThe pharmacodynamic efficacy of lincosamides like clindamycin is driven by cumulative exposure, with the principal index being the ratio of the free drug area under the curve to the MIC ($f\\text{AUC}/\\text{MIC}$), as established in the main text. The average steady-state concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{avg,ss}}$) is directly proportional to the AUC over the dosing interval ($\\text{AUC}_\\tau = C_{\\mathrm{avg,ss}} \\cdot \\tau$) and thus serves as a useful surrogate for total drug exposure.\n\nThe calculated average steady-state concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{avg,ss}} = 5.625$ mg/L, serves as a measure of overall drug exposure. Comparing this total concentration to the typical MIC for susceptible *Staphylococcus aureus* ($MIC = 0.5$ mg/L) can be misleading. A more rigorous interpretation requires accounting for the caveats that translate plasma exposure to effect.\n\n1.  **Plasma vs. Site of Infection:** This calculation pertains to the concentration in plasma. While clindamycin generally achieves good penetration into skin and soft tissues, the concentration at the actual site of infection may differ. This interpretation assumes plasma concentration is a reasonable proxy for the active site concentration.\n2.  **Total vs. Unbound Drug:** The calculation is for *total* (protein-bound plus unbound) drug concentration. Only the *unbound* fraction is microbiologically active. Clindamycin is highly protein-bound (e.g., $\\sim 90\\%$). If only $10\\%$ is free, the average unbound concentration would be approximately $C_{u, \\mathrm{avg,ss}} \\approx 0.10 \\cdot 5.625 \\text{ mg/L} = 0.5625$ mg/L. The corresponding free AUC over the 8-hour interval would be $f\\text{AUC}_\\tau = 0.5625 \\text{ mg/L} \\cdot 8 \\text{ h} = 4.5 \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}$. The resulting $f\\text{AUC}/\\text{MIC}$ ratio would be $4.5 / 0.5 = 9$. While this value suggests the regimen will have some activity, it might be suboptimal compared to targets for other exposure-dependent agents, underscoring the critical importance of considering protein binding in PK/PD analysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.625}$$", "id": "4578744"}, {"introduction": "Clinical efficacy is driven by the concentration of unbound, pharmacologically active drug, not the total concentration measured in plasma. This practice explores this critical concept through a realistic scenario of hypoalbuminemia, a condition that alters drug-protein binding and increases the unbound fraction ($f_u$).

Total exposure (AUC) being the same does not imply the concentration-time profiles and hence time-dependent indices are the same.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. At equal total daily dose, $f\\text{AUC}/\\text{MIC}$ is the same for twice-daily and thrice-daily dosing; however, twice-daily dosing achieves a higher $\\%T>\\text{MIC}$ (approximately $67\\%$ versus $62\\%$) because the higher peak concentration prolongs time above MIC within each interval.**\n- The statement that $f\\text{AUC}/\\text{MIC}$ is the same is **Correct**.\n- The statement that twice-daily dosing achieves a higher $\\%T>\\text{MIC}$ is **Incorrect**. Our calculation shows the opposite.\n- The numerical values are **Incorrect**.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Twice-daily dosing yields both a higher $f\\text{AUC}/\\text{MIC}$ and a higher $\\%T>\\text{MIC}$ than thrice-daily dosing at equal total daily dose, because larger doses produce higher peak concentrations that dominate overall exposure.**\n- The statement that twice-daily dosing yields a higher $f\\text{AUC}/\\text{MIC}$ is **Incorrect**.\n- The statement that twice-daily dosing yields a higher $\\%T>\\text{MIC}$ is **Incorrect**.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4578691"}]}
