It presents a standard ligand-receptor binding scenario from clinical pharmacology that can be solved using fundamental principles of chemical equilibrium. The provided definitions, assumptions, and values are self-contained and consistent, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe central task is to derive the fractional occupancy of the Serotonin Transporter (SERT) by an SSRI antidepressant and evaluate it against a therapeutic threshold. We begin with the definitions provided.\n\nThe system is at equilibrium, described by the reaction:\n$$ R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL $$\nwhere $R$ represents the free receptor (SERT), $L$ represents the free ligand (SSRI drug), and $RL$ represents the receptor-ligand complex. The concentrations of these species are denoted by $[R]$, $[L]$, and $[RL]$, respectively.\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action as:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]} \\quad (1) $$\n\nThe problem states that the free drug concentration, denoted by $C$, is the concentration available to interact with the transporter. Therefore, we have $[L] = C$.\n\nThe total receptor concentration, $[R_T]$, is the sum of free receptors and ligand-bound receptors:\n$$ [R_T] = [R] + [RL] \\quad (2) $$\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\Theta$, is the fraction of total receptors that are bound by the ligand:\n$$ \\Theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]} \\quad (3) $$\n\nOur goal is to derive an expression for $\\Theta$ in terms of $K_d$ and $C$. We can rearrange equation $(2)$ to express the free receptor concentration $[R]$ in terms of $[R_T]$ and $[RL]$:\n$$ [R] = [R_T] - [RL] $$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ and setting $[L] = C$ into the definition of $K_d$ in equation $(1)$:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{([R_T] - [RL])C}{[RL]} $$\n\nWe seek to solve this equation for the ratio $\\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]}$, which is $\\Theta$. We proceed with algebraic manipulation:\n$$ K_d [RL] = ([R_T] - [RL])C $$\n$$ K_d [RL] = [R_T]C - [RL]C $$\n$$ K_d [RL] + [RL]C = [R_T]C $$\n$$ [RL](K_d + C) = [R_T]C $$\n\nDividing both sides by $[R_T]$ and by $(K_d + C)$ gives the fractional occupancy:\n$$ \\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]} = \\frac{C}{K_d + C} $$\nThus, the derived expression for fractional occupancy is:\n$$ \\Theta = \\frac{C}{K_d + C} $$\nThis is the well-known Hill-Langmuir equation for a single, non-cooperative binding site.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\Theta$ using the provided data:\n-   $K_d = 2$ nM\n-   $C = 8$ nM\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ \\Theta = \\frac{8 \\text{ nM}}{2 \\text{ nM} + 8 \\text{ nM}} = \\frac{8}{10} = 0.8 $$\nThe problem requires rounding $\\Theta$ to four significant figures. The exact value of $0.8$ is written as $0.8000$ to meet this requirement.\n\nFinally, we must evaluate the indicator function $\\mathbb{I}(\\Theta  0.80)$. This function equals $1$ if the condition inside the parentheses is true, and $0$ if it is false. The condition is a strict inequality: \"occupancy strictly exceeds the therapeutic threshold of $0.80$\".\nWe test the condition with our calculated value of $\\Theta = 0.8000$:\n$$ \\Theta  0.80 $$\n$$ 0.8000  0.80 $$\nThis inequality is false, as $0.8000$ is equal to, not strictly greater than, $0.80$. Therefore, the value of the indicator function is $0$.\n$$ \\mathbb{I}(\\Theta  0.80) = 0 $$\n\nThe two required values are the fractional occupancy $\\Theta$ rounded to four significant figures, which is $0.8000$, and the value of the indicator function, which is $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.8000  0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4529002"}, {"introduction": "While single-target occupancy is a useful starting point, most drugs interact with multiple targets to varying degrees.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe solution proceeds in three parts: first, calculation of the free drug concentration in the brain; second, calculation of the fractional occupancy for both SERT and NET at this concentration to determine preferential binding and classification; and third, calculation of the selectivity ratio.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Free Brain Concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}}$)**\n\nThe free drug concentration in the brain's interstitial fluid is the pharmacologically active concentration that interacts with the transporters. It is given by the formula:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}} = C_{\\mathrm{plasma,tot}} \\times f_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}} \\times K_{p,uu}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{plasma,tot}} = 160~\\mathrm{nM}$$\n$$f_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}} = 0.05$$\n$$K_{p,uu} = 0.70$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}} = (160~\\mathrm{nM}) \\times 0.05 \\times 0.70$$\nFirst, calculate the free plasma concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{plasma,free}} = C_{\\mathrm{plasma,tot}} \\times f_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{plasma,free}} = 160~\\mathrm{nM} \\times 0.05 = 8~\\mathrm{nM}$$\nNext, calculate the free brain concentration:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}} = C_{\\mathrm{plasma,free}} \\times K_{p,uu} = 8~\\mathrm{nM} \\times 0.70 = 5.6~\\mathrm{nM}$$\n\n**2. Calculation of Transporter Occupancy and Mechanistic Classification**\n\nThe fractional occupancy ($\\theta$) of a transporter by a ligand at equilibrium is described by the Hill-Langmuir equation, which derives from the law of mass action. For a single binding site, it is given by:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_i}$$\nwhere $[L]$ is the free ligand concentration (here, $C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}}$) and $K_i$ is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the transporter.\n\n**SERT Occupancy ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{SERT}}$):**\nUsing $C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}} = 5.6~\\mathrm{nM}$ and $K_{i}^{\\mathrm{SERT}} = 0.90~\\mathrm{nM}$:\n$$\\theta_{\\mathrm{SERT}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}}}{C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}} + K_{i}^{\\mathrm{SERT}}} = \\frac{5.6}{5.6 + 0.90} = \\frac{5.6}{6.5} \\approx 0.8615$$\nThis corresponds to approximately $86.2\\%$ occupancy of the serotonin transporter.\n\n**NET Occupancy ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{NET}}$):**\nUsing $C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}} = 5.6~\\mathrm{nM}$ and $K_{i}^{\\mathrm{NET}} = 60~\\mathrm{nM}$:\n$$\\theta_{\\mathrm{NET}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}}}{C_{\\mathrm{brain,free}} + K_{i}^{\\mathrm{NET}}} = \\frac{5.6}{5.6 + 60} = \\frac{5.6}{65.6} \\approx 0.08536$$\nThis corresponds to approximately $8.5\\%$ occupancy of the norepinephrine transporter.\n\n**Mechanistic Classification:**\nThe calculations show that at clinically relevant steady-state concentrations, the drug occupies a very high fraction of SERT ($\\approx 86\\%$) while occupying a very low fraction of NET ($\\approx 8.5\\%$). This dramatic preference for SERT over NET is the defining characteristic of a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI). A serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) would exhibit substantial occupancy of both transporters. Therefore, the drug preferentially occupies SERT over NET, and its mechanistic classification is an SSRI.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Selectivity Ratio**\n\nThe problem defines the selectivity ratio as the ratio of the dissociation constants for NET and SERT. This ratio quantifies the drug's preference for SERT over NET; a higher value indicates greater selectivity for SERT.\n$$\\text{Selectivity Ratio} = \\frac{K_{i}^{\\mathrm{NET}}}{K_{i}^{\\mathrm{SERT}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$K_{i}^{\\mathrm{NET}} = 60~\\mathrm{nM}$$\n$$K_{i}^{\\mathrm{SERT}} = 0.90~\\mathrm{nM}$$\n$$\\text{Selectivity Ratio} = \\frac{60}{0.90} = \\frac{600}{9} = \\frac{200}{3} \\approx 66.666...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\text{Selectivity Ratio} \\approx 66.7$$\nThe ratio is a unitless quantity since the units of concentration ($\\mathrm{nM}$) in the numerator and denominator cancel.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{66.7}$$", "id": "4529029"}, {"introduction": "The clinical pharmacology of many antidepressants is complicated by the presence of active metabolites, which can contribute significantly to, or even dominate, the overall therapeutic effect.
