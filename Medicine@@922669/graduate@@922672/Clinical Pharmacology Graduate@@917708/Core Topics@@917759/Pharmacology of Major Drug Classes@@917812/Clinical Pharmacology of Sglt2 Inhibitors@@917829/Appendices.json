We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fractional excretion of glucose, denoted as $FE_g$, is defined as the ratio of the urinary excretion rate of glucose to the filtered load of glucose.\n$$FE_g = \\frac{\\text{Urinary Excretion Rate of Glucose}}{\\text{Filtered Load of Glucose}}$$\nThe urinary excretion rate of any solute is the product of its urinary concentration and the urine flow rate. Let $U_g$ be the urinary glucose concentration and $V$ be the urine flow rate. The excretion rate of glucose is therefore:\n$$\\text{Urinary Excretion Rate of Glucose} = U_g \\times V$$\nThe filtered load of a freely filtered solute is the product of its plasma concentration and the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR).

Since glucose is freely filtered at the glomerulus, its filtered load is:\n$$\\text{Filtered Load of Glucose} = P_g \\times \\text{GFR}$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the definition of $FE_g$, we obtain:\n$$FE_g = \\frac{U_g \\times V}{P_g \\times \\text{GFR}}$$\nThis expression contains two quantities, $V$ and GFR, which are not directly provided.

This principle states that the total concentration of positive charges (cations) must equal the total concentration of negative charges (anions) to maintain a net charge of zero.\n\nLet us denote the concentrations of the major cations in plasma as $[\\text{Na}^+]$ (sodium) and $[\\text{K}^+]$ (potassium), and other cations (e.g., $[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$, $[\\text{Mg}^{2+}]$) which are not routinely measured for this purpose as unmeasured cations, $[\\text{UC}]$. Similarly, let the concentrations of the major anions be $[\\text{Cl}^-]$ (chloride) and $[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$ (bicarbonate), and other anions (e.g., albumin, phosphate, sulfate, organic acids) as unmeasured anions, $[\\text{UA}]$.\n\nThe electroneutrality equation can be written as:\n$$[\\text{Total Cations}] = [\\text{Total Anions}]$$\n$$([\\text{Na}^+] + [\\text{K}^+]) + [\\text{UC}] = ([\\text{Cl}^-] + [\\text{HCO}_3^-]) + [\\text{UA}]$$\n\nIn routine clinical practice, the anion gap ($AG$) is defined as the difference between the routinely measured major cation and the routinely measured major anions. The most common formula omits potassium for simplicity, as its plasma concentration is relatively low and stable. Thus, the measured cation is primarily $[\\text{Na}^+]$ and the measured anions are $[\\text{Cl}^-]$ and $[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$.\n\nThe anion gap is designed to quantify the \"unmeasured anions\". Rearranging the electroneutrality equation, while representing all routinely unmeasured cations (including $[\\text{K}^+]$ in this common formulation) by the term $[\\text{UC}]$, we get:\n$$[\\text{Na}^+] = ([\\text{Cl}^-] + [\\text{HCO}_3^-]) + ([\\text{UA}] - [\\text{UC}])$$\nThe term $([\\text{UA}] - [\\text{UC}])$ represents the \"gap\". Therefore, the anion gap is defined as:\n$$AG = [\\text{UA}] - [\\text{UC}] = [\\text{Na}^+] - ([\\text{Cl}^-] + [\\text{HCO}_3^-])$$\nThis equation allows for the calculation of the anion gap using standard laboratory values.\n\nNow, we will use the provided laboratory values to compute the numerical value of the anion gap.\nGiven:\nSerum sodium $[\\text{Na}^+] = 140~\\text{mmol/L}$\nSerum chloride $[\\text{Cl}^-] = 102~\\text{mmol/L}$\nSerum bicarbonate $[\\text{HCO}_3^-] = 18~\\text{mmol/L}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$AG = 140 - (102 + 18)$$\n$$AG = 140 - 120$$\n$$AG = 20~\\text{mmol/L}$$\nThe calculated anion gap is $20~\\text{mmol/L}$, which verifies the value flagged in the electronic report. A normal anion gap is typically in the range of $8-12~\\text{mmol/L}$, so a value of $20~\\text{mmol/L}$ is significantly elevated.\n\nFinally, we must decide whether this clinical picture is consistent with euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The key components for this diagnosis are:\n$1$. **High Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis (HAGMA):** The patient's arterial pH is $7.28$, which is below the normal range (typically $7.35-7.45$), confirming acidemia. The serum bicarbonate is low at $18~\\text{mmol/L}$ (normal $\\approx 22-28~\\text{mmol/L}$), indicating a primary metabolic acidosis. The tachypnea is the expected respiratory compensation. Our calculated anion gap of $20~\\text{mmol/L}$ is high, confirming a HAGMA.\n$2$. **Ketogenesis:** The laboratory finding of qualitatively positive serum ketones confirms the presence of ketone bodies (organic acids such as $\\beta$-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate), which are the unmeasured anions responsible for the elevated anion gap.\n$3$. **Euglycemia:** The serum glucose is $8~\\text{mmol/L}$. This is considered normal or near-normal, especially in the context of DKA where glucose levels are typically markedly elevated ($> 14~\\text{mmol/L}$).\n\nThe pharmacology of SGLT$2$ inhibitors explains this presentation. By promoting urinary glucose excretion, these drugs can prevent severe hyperglycemia. However, in states of relative insulin deficiency (precipitated here by illness and reduced oral intake), the underlying hormonal milieu (low insulin, high glucagon) still promotes lipolysis and hepatic ketogenesis. This leads to the paradoxical development of DKA without the hallmark hyperglycemia.\n\nTherefore, the constellation of findings—high anion gap metabolic acidosis, positive ketones, and near-normal glucose in a patient on an SGLT$2$ inhibitor with a precipitating illness—is the classic presentation and is highly consistent with a diagnosis of euglycemic DKA.\n\nThe problem asks for the single numeric value of the computed anion gap.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$", "id": "4540612"}]}
