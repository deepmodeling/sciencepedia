Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV$_1$) is defined as the volume of air exhaled during the first second of a forced expiratory maneuver and is a core spirometric index of airway caliber. According to widely accepted criteria from the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), a bronchodilator response is considered “significant” if both the relative change from baseline and the absolute change meet thresholds: the relative change is at least a specified fraction of the baseline and the absolute change is at least a specified absolute volume increment.

This is defined as the relative change from the baseline value, $V_{\\text{pre}}$. The relative change, let's call it $R_{\\text{rel}}$, is calculated as:\n$$R_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{post}} - V_{\\text{pre}}}{V_{\\text{pre}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{2.1 - 1.8}{1.8} = \\frac{0.3}{1.8}$$\nThis fraction simplifies to:\n$$R_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{1}{6}$$\nAs a decimal, this is a repeating fraction:\n$$R_{\\text{rel}} = 0.16666...$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, we have:\n$$R_{\\text{rel}} \\approx 0.1667$$\n\nThe second task is to determine if the bronchodilator response is “significant” based on the ATS/ERS criteria. A significant response requires meeting two conditions simultaneously.\n\nCondition 1: The relative change must be at least $0.12$.\nWe have calculated the relative change as $R_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.1667$.\nWe check if this condition is met:\n$$0.1667 \\geq 0.12$$\nThis inequality is true. Thus, the first condition is met.\n\nCondition 2: The absolute increase must be at least $0.2$ L.\nThe absolute increase, let's call it $\\Delta V_{\\text{abs}}$, is the difference between the post- and pre-bronchodilator values:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{abs}} = V_{\\text{post}} - V_{\\text{pre}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{abs}} = 2.1 \\, \\text{L} - 1.8 \\, \\text{L} = 0.3 \\, \\text{L}$$\nWe check if this condition is met:\n$$0.3 \\, \\text{L} \\geq 0.2 \\, \\text{L}$$\nThis inequality is true. Thus, the second condition is also met.\n\nSince both the relative change ($R_{\\text{rel}} \\geq 0.12$) and the absolute increase ($\\Delta V_{\\text{abs}} \\geq 0.2$ L) criteria are satisfied, the bronchodilator response is classified as “significant.” According to the problem specification, a significant response is coded with the numeric value $1$.\n\nThe final result is a row matrix containing two entries: the decimal fraction for the percent reversibility rounded to four significant figures, and the numeric classification code.\nThe first entry is $0.1667$.\nThe second entry is $1$.\nThe final result is therefore presented as a $1 \\times 2$ matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.1667  1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4532848"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principle of quantifying drug effects, a frequent clinical task is to switch a patient between different medications within the same therapeutic class.

A detailed solution follows.\n\nThe objective is to find the eosinophil count $E^{\\ast}$ for which the net change in annual disutility is zero. This condition is expressed by the equation $\\Delta(E^{\\ast}) = 0$:\n$$d_{e}\\left[p_{e,\\mathrm{ICS}}(E^{\\ast}) - p_{e0}\\right] + d_{p}\\left[p_{p,\\mathrm{ICS}} - p_{p0}\\right] = 0$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to isolate the effect of exacerbation reduction from the harm of pneumonia increase:\n$$d_{e}\\left[p_{e,\\mathrm{ICS}}(E^{\\ast}) - p_{e0}\\right] = -d_{p}\\left[p_{p,\\mathrm{ICS}} - p_{p0}\\right]$$\nWe will solve this equation by first calculating the constant terms related to pneumonia and then solving for the exacerbation-related probability, which will allow us to find $E^{\\ast}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the terms for pneumonia. The baseline probability of pneumonia is given as $p_{p0} = 0.05$. The corresponding baseline odds are:\n$$o_{p0} = \\frac{p_{p0}}{1 - p_{p0}} = \\frac{0.05}{1 - 0.05} = \\frac{0.05}{0.95} = \\frac{5}{95} = \\frac{1}{19}$$\nWith ICS treatment, these odds are multiplied by the odds ratio $OR_{p} = 1.40$.

The baseline probability of exacerbation is $p_{e0} = 0.50$. The baseline odds are:\n$$o_{e0} = \\frac{p_{e0}}{1 - p_{e0}} = \\frac{0.50}{1 - 0.50} = 1$$\nWith ICS, the odds of exacerbation at an eosinophil count $E$ become:\n$$o_{e,\\mathrm{ICS}}(E) = OR_{e}(E) \\cdot o_{e0} = OR_{e}(E) \\cdot 1 = OR_{e}(E)$$\nThe probability of exacerbation with ICS is:\n$$p_{e,\\mathrm{ICS}}(E) = \\frac{o_{e,\\mathrm{ICS}}(E)}{1 + o_{e,\\mathrm{ICS}}(E)} = \\frac{OR_{e}(E)}{1 + OR_{e}(E)}$$\nNow, we substitute these expressions back into the primary equation at the threshold $E^{\\ast}$:\n$$d_{e}\\left[p_{e,\\mathrm{ICS}}(E^{\\ast}) - p_{e0}\\right] = -d_{p}\\left[p_{p,\\mathrm{ICS}} - p_{p0}\\right]$$\nSubstituting the known values $d_e = 1$, $d_p = 3$, $p_{e0} = 0.50$, and the calculated change in pneumonia probability:\n$$1 \\cdot \\left[p_{e,\\mathrm{ICS}}(E^{\\ast}) - 0.50\\right] = -3 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{19}{1020}\\right)$$\n$$p_{e,\\mathrm{ICS}}(E^{\\ast}) - 0.50 = -\\frac{57}{1020}$$\n$$p_{e,\\mathrm{ICS}}(E^{\\ast}) = 0.50 - \\frac{57}{1020} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{57}{1020} = \\frac{510}{1020} - \\frac{57}{1020} = \\frac{453}{1020}$$\nWe can now use the relationship $p = o/(1+o)$, which implies $o = p/(1-p)$, to find the required odds ratio. At the threshold, $OR_{e}(E^{\\ast}) = o_{e,\\mathrm{ICS}}(E^{\\ast})$.\n$$OR_{e}(E^{\\ast}) = \\frac{p_{e,\\mathrm{ICS}}(E^{\\ast})}{1 - p_{e,\\mathrm{ICS}}(E^{\\ast})} = \\frac{453/1020}{1 - 453/1020} = \\frac{453/1020}{(1020 - 453)/1020} = \\frac{453}{567}$$\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. The sum of the digits of $453$ is $12$ and of $567$ is $18$, so both are divisible by $3$.\n$$OR_{e}(E^{\\ast}) = \\frac{453 \\div 3}{567 \\div 3} = \\frac{151}{189}$$\nThe number $151$ is prime, so this fraction is in simplest form.\n\nFinally, we solve for $E^{\\ast}$ using the definition of $OR_{e}(E)$:\n$$OR_{e}(E^{\\ast}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta E^{\\ast}}{100}\\right) = \\frac{151}{189}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\frac{\\beta E^{\\ast}}{100} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{151}{189}\\right)$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$:\n$$\\frac{\\beta E^{\\ast}}{100} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{189}{151}\\right)$$\nNow we solve for $E^{\\ast}$ by substituting $\\beta = 0.12$:\n$$E^{\\ast} = \\frac{100}{\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{189}{151}\\right) = \\frac{100}{0.12} \\ln\\left(\\frac{189}{151}\\right)$$\nNumerically evaluating this expression:\n$$E^{\\ast} = \\frac{100}{0.12} \\ln\\left(\\frac{189}{151}\\right) \\approx 833.333 \\times \\ln(1.251656) \\approx 833.333 \\times 0.224460$$\n$$E^{\\ast} \\approx 187.0504$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, we obtain $E^{\\ast} = 187$.
