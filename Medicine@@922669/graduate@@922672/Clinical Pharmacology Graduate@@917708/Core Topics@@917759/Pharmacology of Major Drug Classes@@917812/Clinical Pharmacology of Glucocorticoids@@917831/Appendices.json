It is well-posed, with all necessary data provided for a unique solution.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $f$, of a receptor by a ligand is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the ligand-receptor complex, $[LR]$, to the total concentration of receptors, $R_T$.\n$$f = \\frac{[LR]}{R_T}$$\nThe total receptor concentration, $R_T$, is the sum of the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$, and the concentration of ligand-bound receptors, $[LR]$.\n$$R_T = [R] + [LR]$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $f$ gives:\n$$f = \\frac{[LR]}{[R] + [LR]}$$\nThe equilibrium for the reversible binding reaction $L + R \\rightleftharpoons LR$ is described by the dissociation constant, $K_d$.\n$$K_d = \\frac{[L][R]}{[LR]}$$\nWe can rearrange this expression to solve for the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$.\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_d [LR]}{[L]}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the denominator of the fractional occupancy equation.\n$$f = \\frac{[LR]}{\\frac{K_d [LR]}{[L]} + [LR]}$$\nThe term $[LR]$ is a common factor in the denominator and can be factored out.\n$$f = \\frac{[LR]}{[LR] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1 \\right)}$$\nCanceling the $[LR]$ term from the numerator and denominator yields:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1}$$\nTo simplify, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[L]$.\n$$f = \\frac{[L]}{[L]\\left(\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1\\right)} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$$\nThis is the required expression for fractional occupancy, $f$, in terms of the free ligand concentration, $[L]$, and the dissociation constant, $K_d$.

Assuming that the biological effect is directly proportional to the fractional receptor occupancy (which is implied by the conditions of similar intrinsic efficacy and no receptor reserve), a more potent ligand will achieve a higher fractional occupancy at a given concentration compared to a less potent ligand. The dissociation constant, $K_d$, represents the ligand concentration at which $50\\%$ of the receptors are occupied ($f=0.5$). A lower $K_d$ signifies a higher affinity of the ligand for the receptor. According to the derived equation $f = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_d}$, for a fixed $[L]$, a smaller $K_d$ results in a larger value of $f$. Since $K_{d,\\text{dexamethasone}} (5\\,\\text{nM})$ is lower than $K_{d,\\text{cortisol}} (50\\,\\text{nM})$, dexamethasone has a higher affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. Therefore, at the same free plasma concentration, dexamethasone achieves a significantly higher fractional occupancy ($0.8000$) compared to cortisol ($0.2857$).

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe fundamental principle governing pharmacokinetics at steady-state for a drug administered orally is the mass balance equation: the rate of drug administration into the systemic circulation must equal the rate of drug elimination from the systemic circulation.\n\nThe rate of drug administration is the amount of drug that becomes systemically available per unit time. This is given by the product of the dose ($Dose$) and the absolute oral bioavailability ($F$), divided by the dosing interval ($\\tau$):\n$$\n\\text{Rate In} = \\frac{F \\times Dose}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe rate of drug elimination is the product of the systemic clearance ($CL$) and the average steady-state plasma concentration ($C_{ss,avg}$):\n$$\n\\text{Rate Out} = CL \\times C_{ss,avg}\n$$\nAt steady state, Rate In = Rate Out:\n$$\n\\frac{F \\times Dose}{\\tau} = CL \\times C_{ss,avg}\n$$\nSolving for the average steady-state concentration yields the governing equation:\n$$\nC_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\times Dose}{CL \\times \\tau}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the new steady-state average concentration ($C_{ss,avg, new}$) after the initiation of rifampin. We are given the following parameters for this new state:\n- Bioavailability, $F = 0.80$ (unchanged).\n- Dose, $Dose = 6$ mg (unchanged).\n- Dosing interval, $\\tau = 24$ h (unchanged).\n- The baseline clearance is $CL_{orig} = 15$ L/h. Rifampin increases this by $100\\%$. A $100\\%$ increase means the new clearance, $CL_{new}$, is the original clearance plus the increase:\n$$\nCL_{new} = CL_{orig} + (100\\% \\times CL_{orig}) = CL_{orig} + (1.0 \\times CL_{orig}) = 2 \\times CL_{orig}\n$$\n$$\nCL_{new} = 2 \\times 15~\\text{L/h} = 30~\\text{L/h}\n$$\nNow, we can calculate the new average steady-state concentration, $C_{ss,avg, new}$, by substituting the values into the governing equation:\n$$\nC_{ss,avg, new} = \\frac{F \\times Dose}{CL_{new} \\times \\tau} = \\frac{0.80 \\times 6~\\text{mg}}{30~\\text{L/h} \\times 24~\\text{h}}\n$$\n$$\nC_{ss,avg, new} = \\frac{4.8~\\text{mg}}{720~\\text{L}} = 0.006666...~\\text{mg/L}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be in units of ng/mL.

Therefore, the new dose required to restore the original exposure is:\n$$\nDose_{new} = 6~\\text{mg} \\times 2 = 12~\\text{mg}\n$$\nThe simplest maintenance dose adjustment is to double the dose from $6$ mg every $24$ hours to $12$ mg every $24$ hours.

The givens are self-contained, consistent, and sufficient to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and the assumptions are clearly stated.

This relationship can be expressed as:\n$$E = k \\cdot P_r \\cdot D$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on the patient and the specific inflammatory condition, but is identical for all glucocorticoids acting through the same mechanism.\n\nThe objective is to find a dose of dexamethasone, $D_{\\mathrm{Dex}}$, that produces an anti-inflammatory effect equal to that of a given dose of prednisone, $D_{\\mathrm{Pred}} = 40\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. This condition of equi-anti-inflammatory effect is stated as:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{Dex}} = E_{\\mathrm{Pred}}$$\n\nSubstituting the fundamental relationship into this equivalence condition yields:\n$$k \\cdot P_{r, \\mathrm{Dex}} \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{Dex}} = k \\cdot P_{r, \\mathrm{Pred}} \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{Pred}}$$\nThe constant $k$ cancels, which is expected as we are seeking a dose equivalence that is independent of the specific patient. This leaves the core relationship for dose conversion:\n$$P_{r, \\mathrm{Dex}} \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{Dex}} = P_{r, \\mathrm{Pred}} \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{Pred}}$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the unknown dexamethasone dose, $D_{\\mathrm{Dex}}$:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{Dex}} = D_{\\mathrm{Pred}} \\cdot \\frac{P_{r, \\mathrm{Pred}}}{P_{r, \\mathrm{Dex}}}$$\nThis is the symbolic conversion relationship required. To use it, we must first determine the relative potencies, $P_{r, \\mathrm{Pred}}$ and $P_{r, \\mathrm{Dex}}$, from the provided clinical facts.\n\nThe relative anti-inflammatory potency, $P_r$, of a given glucocorticoid is defined relative to a standard, which is hydrocortisone ($\\mathrm{HC}$).

The potency of any other glucocorticoid, 'X', is determined from the dose $D_{\\mathrm{X,equiv}}$ that produces the same effect as the reference dose of hydrocortisone, $D_{\\mathrm{HC,ref}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. From the core relationship:\n$$P_{r, \\mathrm{X}} \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{X,equiv}} = P_{r, \\mathrm{HC}} \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{HC,ref}}$$\nSince $P_{r, \\mathrm{HC}} = 1$, we can derive a formula for the relative potency of drug 'X':\n$$P_{r, \\mathrm{X}} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{HC,ref}}}{D_{\\mathrm{X,equiv}}}$$\n\nUsing the provided clinical fact that $20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ of hydrocortisone is equi-anti-inflammatory to $5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ of prednisone, we have $D_{\\mathrm{HC,ref}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and $D_{\\mathrm{Pred,equiv}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.
