Therefore, for any saturable elimination process described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics, doubling the infusion rate will *always* result in more than a doubling of the steady-state concentration, provided the new rate does not exceed $V_{\\max}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In individuals with reduced CYP2C19 activity (poor metabolizers), a lower $V_{\\max}$ increases the likelihood that doubling $R_{\\text{in}}$ yields more than a doubling of $C_{ss}$, and even risks loss of steady state as $R_{\\text{in}}$ approaches $V_{\\max}$.**\nReduced CYP2C19 activity corresponds to a lower maximum metabolic capacity, i.e., a smaller $V_{\\max}$. The amplification factor is $\\dfrac{C_2/C_1}{2} = \\dfrac{V_{\\max} - R_1}{V_{\\max} - 2R_1}$. As $V_{\\max}$ decreases and approaches $2R_1$ (with $R_1$ being the initial dose), the denominator of this fraction approaches zero, causing the factor to increase without bound. This means the supra-proportional increase in $C_{ss}$ becomes more extreme. Furthermore, if $R_{\\text{in}}$ approaches this lower $V_{\\max}$, the denominator of $C_{ss} = \\dfrac{R_{\\text{in}} K_m}{V_{\\max} - R_{\\text{in}}}$ approaches zero, causing $C_{ss}$ to rise to potentially toxic levels. If $R_{\\text{in}} \\ge V_{\\max}$, no steady state is achievable, and the concentration will increase indefinitely. A lower $V_{\\max}$ makes this \"loss of steady state\" possible at lower, more clinically common infusion rates. The statement is conceptually sound.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Under Michaelis–Menten elimination, at steady state $R_{\\text{in}} = V_{\\max}\\,\\dfrac{C_{ss}}{K_m + C_{ss}}$; if $C_{ss} \\ll K_m$, doubling $R_{\\text{in}}$ approximately doubles $C_{ss}$.**\nThe steady-state equation is stated correctly. In the case where the concentration is much lower than the Michaelis constant ($C_{ss} \\ll K_m$), the denominator in the rate law simplifies: $K_m + C_{ss} \\approx K_m$. The steady-state equation becomes:\n$$R_{\\text{in}} \\approx V_{\\max}\\,\\dfrac{C_{ss}}{K_m} = \\left(\\dfrac{V_{\\max}}{K_m}\\right)C_{ss}$$\nIn this low-concentration regime, $R_{\\text{in}}$ is approximately proportional to $C_{ss}$. The term in parentheses, $\\dfrac{V_{\\max}}{K_m}$, acts as a constant clearance term. This is a linear relationship, characteristic of first-order kinetics. Therefore, doubling $R_{\\text{in}}$ will approximately double $C_{ss}$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. For voriconazole, the dose–$C_{ss}$ relationship remains linear because its oral bioavailability is high; doubling maintenance dose always doubles $C_{ss}$.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, the problem is defined by a nonlinear elimination process (Michaelis-Menten), so the dose–$C_{ss}$ relationship is inherently nonlinear. The assertion that it \"remains linear\" is a direct contradiction. Second, bioavailability is a parameter of absorption, describing the fraction of an oral dose that reaches systemic circulation. It has no bearing on the mechanism of elimination, which governs the relationship between systemic drug levels and dose rate at steady state. The conclusion that \"doubling maintenance dose always doubles $C_{ss}$\" is only true for linear pharmacokinetics, which is not the case here.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. With $V_{\\max} = 6$ mg/h and $K_m = 1$ mg/L, doubling $R_{\\text{in}}$ from $2$ mg/h to $4$ mg/h increases $C_{ss}$ from $0.5$ mg/L to $2.0$ mg/L, a fourfold increase.**\nWe use the derived formula $C_{ss} = \\dfrac{R_{\\text{in}} K_m}{V_{\\max} - R_{\\text{in}}}$.\nGiven: $V_{\\max} = 6$ mg/h, $K_m = 1$ mg/L.\n\nFor the initial rate $R_{\\text{in}, 1} = 2$ mg/h:\n$$C_{ss, 1} = \\dfrac{(2 \\text{ mg/h})(1 \\text{ mg/L})}{6 \\text{ mg/h} - 2 \\text{ mg/h}} = \\dfrac{2}{4} \\text{ mg/L} = 0.5 \\text{ mg/L}$$\n\nFor the doubled rate $R_{\\text{in}, 2} = 4$ mg/h:\n$$C_{ss, 2} = \\dfrac{(4 \\text{ mg/h})(1 \\text{ mg/L})}{6 \\text{ mg/h} - 4 \\text{ mg/h}} = \\dfrac{4}{2} \\text{ mg/L} = 2.0 \\text{ mg/L}$$\n\nThe infusion rate is doubled ($2 \\rightarrow 4$). The steady-state concentration increases from $0.5$ mg/L to $2.0$ mg/L. The ratio of the new concentration to the old is $\\dfrac{2.0}{0.5} = 4$. This is a fourfold increase. The calculations are correct and support the statement.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. In the nonlinear region, the apparent clearance $CL_{\\text{app}} = \\dfrac{\\text{Rate}}{C_{ss}}$ decreases as $C_{ss}$ rises, so more-than-proportional increases in $C_{ss}$ are expected when $C_{ss} \\approx K_m$.**\nBy definition, clearance $CL$ relates elimination rate to concentration. For nonlinear kinetics, we use apparent clearance, $CL_{\\text{app}}$. At steady state, Rate of Elimination $= R_{\\text{in}}$.\n$$CL_{\\text{app}} = \\dfrac{R_{\\text{in}}}{C_{ss}}$$\nFrom the Michaelis-Menten steady-state equation, we can substitute for the ratio $\\dfrac{R_{\\text{in}}}{C_{ss}}$:\n$$R_{\\text{in}} = \\dfrac{V_{\\max} C_{ss}}{K_m + C_{ss}} \\implies \\dfrac{R_{\\text{in}}}{C_{ss}} = \\dfrac{V_{\\max}}{K_m + C_{ss}}$$\nThus, $CL_{\\text{app}} = \\dfrac{V_{\\max}}{K_m + C_{ss}}$. As $C_{ss}$ increases, the denominator $(K_m + C_{ss})$ increases, causing $CL_{\\text{app}}$ to decrease. This means the body's efficiency at clearing the drug diminishes at higher concentrations. A decrease in clearance with increasing dose/concentration is the direct cause of more-than-proportional increases in $C_{ss}$. This effect is prominent in the \"nonlinear region,\" which is centered around $C_{ss} = K_m$. The statement correctly links these concepts.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**F. When $R_{\\text{in}} > V_{\\max}$, a new steady state exists at $C_{ss} = R_{\\text{in}}$ because input exceeds the enzyme’s capacity by a constant offset.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The maximum rate of elimination, $v_{\\text{elim, max}}$, is $V_{\\max}$. For a steady state to exist, the rate of drug input must equal the rate of drug elimination. If the infusion rate $R_{\\text{in}}$ is greater than $V_{\\max}$, then the rate of drug entering the body is always greater than the maximum possible rate of elimination. The body cannot clear the drug as fast as it is administered. Consequently, no steady state can be achieved, and the drug concentration will rise indefinitely. Furthermore, the proposed equation $C_{ss} = R_{\\text{in}}$ is dimensionally inconsistent: $C_{ss}$ has units of mass/volume (e.g., mg/L) while $R_{\\text{in}}$ has units of mass/time (e.g., mg/h). An equality between them is physically and mathematically meaningless.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDE}$$", "id": "4529724"}]}
