The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe goal is to find an expression for the recovery time, $t_{\\text{rec}}$, as a function of the elimination half-life, $t_{1/2}$.\n\nFirst, we utilize the initial condition provided. At time $t=0$, the fractional inhibition is $I(0) = 0.95$. The concentration at this time is $C(0) = C_0$. Using the pharmacodynamic model:\n$$I(C_0) = \\frac{C_0}{C_0 + IC_{50}} = 0.95$$\nWe can solve this equation to establish a relationship between the initial concentration $C_0$ and the pharmacodynamic parameter $IC_{50}$:\n$$C_0 = 0.95 (C_0 + IC_{50})$$\n$$C_0 = 0.95 C_0 + 0.95 IC_{50}$$\n$$C_0 - 0.95 C_0 = 0.95 IC_{50}$$\n$$0.05 C_0 = 0.95 IC_{50}$$\n$$C_0 = \\frac{0.95}{0.05} IC_{50} = 19 \\cdot IC_{50}$$\nThis equation links the initial concentration to the $IC_{50}$ of the drug.\n\nNext, we use the definition of recovery time, $t_{\\text{rec}}$. This is the time at which platelet function $F(t_{\\text{rec}})$ equals $0.90$.\n$$F(t_{\\text{rec}}) = 1 - I(t_{\\text{rec}}) = 0.90$$\nThis implies that the fractional inhibition at time $t_{\\text{rec}}$ is:\n$$I(t_{\\text{rec}}) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\nLet $C_{\\text{rec}}$ be the drug concentration at time $t_{\\text{rec}}$, so $C_{\\text{rec}} = C(t_{\\text{rec}})$. We apply the pharmacodynamic model at this concentration:\n$$I(C_{\\text{rec}}) = \\frac{C_{\\text{rec}}}{C_{\\text{rec}} + IC_{50}} = 0.10$$\nSolving for $C_{\\text{rec}}$ in terms of $IC_{50}$:\n$$C_{\\text{rec}} = 0.10 (C_{\\text{rec}} + IC_{50})$$\n$$C_{\\text{rec}} = 0.10 C_{\\text{rec}} + 0.10 IC_{50}$$\n$$C_{\\text{rec}} - 0.10 C_{\\text{rec}} = 0.10 IC_{50}$$\n$$0.90 C_{\\text{rec}} = 0.10 IC_{50}$$\n$$C_{\\text{rec}} = \\frac{0.10}{0.90} IC_{50} = \\frac{1}{9} IC_{50}$$\n\nNow, we use the pharmacokinetic model that describes the decline in concentration over time:\n$$C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-k t)$$\nAt time $t = t_{\\text{rec}}$, the concentration is $C(t_{\\text{rec}}) = C_{\\text{rec}}$. Thus:\n$$C_{\\text{rec}} = C_0 \\exp(-k t_{\\text{rec}})$$\nWe can now substitute the expressions we derived for $C_0$ and $C_{\\text{rec}}$ in terms of $IC_{50}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{9} IC_{50} = (19 \\cdot IC_{50}) \\exp(-k t_{\\text{rec}})$$\nThe unknown parameter $IC_{50}$ is present on both sides and cancels out, as required for a well-posed problem:\n$$\\frac{1}{9} = 19 \\exp(-k t_{\\text{rec}})$$\nWe proceed to solve for $t_{\\text{rec}}$:\n$$\\exp(-k t_{\\text{rec}}) = \\frac{1}{9 \\times 19} = \\frac{1}{171}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(\\exp(-k t_{\\text{rec}})) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{171}\\right)$$\n$$-k t_{\\text{rec}} = -\\ln(171)$$\n$$k t_{\\text{rec}} = \\ln(171)$$\n$$t_{\\text{rec}} = \\frac{\\ln(171)}{k}$$\nFinally, we substitute the given expression for the elimination rate constant, $k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$:\n$$t_{\\text{rec}} = \\frac{\\ln(171)}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}}$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final analytical form for $t_{\\text{rec}}$ as a function of $t_{1/2}$:\n$$t_{\\text{rec}} = t_{1/2} \\frac{\\ln(171)}{\\ln(2)}$$\nThe units of $t_{\\text{rec}}$ will be the same as the units of $t_{1/2}$ (minutes, as per the problem's final instruction).

A solution will be derived based on the provided principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to ensure the oral P2Y₁₂ inhibitor can effectively bind to its target receptor. This requires understanding the pharmacodynamic interaction between cangrelor and the oral agent.\n\nFirst, let's quantify the state of the P2Y₁₂ receptors during the cangrelor infusion.\nGiven $[L_{\\mathrm{cang}}] = 100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $K_{d,\\mathrm{cang}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, the ratio is $[L_{\\mathrm{cang}}]/K_{d,\\mathrm{cang}} = 100$.\nThe fractional occupancy of P2Y₁₂ receptors by cangrelor, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{cang}}$, is:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{cang}} = \\frac{[L_{\\mathrm{cang}}]/K_{d,\\mathrm{cang}}}{1 + [L_{\\mathrm{cang}}]/K_{d,\\mathrm{cang}}} = \\frac{100}{1 + 100} = \\frac{100}{101} \\approx 0.99\n$$\nThis confirms the infusion produces near-saturating occupancy. Consequently, the fraction of free receptors available for binding is negligible:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{free}} = 1 - \\theta_{\\mathrm{cang}} \\approx 1 - 0.99 = 0.01\n$$\nOnly about $1\\%$ of P2Y₁₂ receptors are available at any given moment.\n\nThe active metabolites of the thienopyridines (clopidogrel and prasugrel) must bind to an unoccupied receptor to form a covalent, irreversible bond. Pharmacodynamic antagonism occurs if cangrelor prevents this binding.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Administer a clopidogrel loading dose of $600\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ during the cangrelor infusion, approximately $30$ minutes before stopping the infusion, to ensure the active metabolite is present while cangrelor remains on board.**\nThis strategy involves administering clopidogrel while cangrelor is at steady-state. Clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires absorption and metabolic activation to form its active metabolite (clopidogrel active metabolite, CAM). By the time CAM reaches the platelets, the P2Y₁₂ receptors are nearly fully occupied by cangrelor ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{cang}} \\approx 0.99$). Since CAM and cangrelor compete for the same orthosteric binding site, and CAM requires an unoccupied receptor for its irreversible action, it will be unable to bind effectively. CAM has a short half-life ($t_{1/2} \\approx 30$ minutes) and will be substantially cleared from the plasma before the cangrelor infusion is stopped and receptors become available. Thus, the effect of the clopidogrel dose is antagonized by cangrelor. This strategy fails to minimize antagonism.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Discontinue cangrelor and then immediately administer a prasugrel loading dose of $60\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ to allow irreversible binding to occur in the absence of cangrelor occupancy.**\nThis strategy involves temporal separation of the competing drugs. First, the cangrelor infusion is stopped. Due to its extremely short half-life ($t_{1/2} \\approx 3-6$ minutes), cangrelor plasma concentration will decrease by over $90\\%$ within $15-20$ minutes (approx. $4$ half-lives), causing a rapid increase in the fraction of free P2Y₁₂ receptors. Prasugrel, given after cangrelor discontinuation, requires time for absorption and metabolic activation to its active metabolite (prasugrel active metabolite, PAM). By the time PAM concentration peaks (typically around $30$ minutes post-dose), cangrelor will be almost completely cleared from the system. The receptors will be unoccupied and available for PAM to bind irreversibly. This strategy successfully avoids the competitive interaction at the receptor level. It therefore minimizes pharmacodynamic antagonism.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Administer a ticagrelor loading dose of $180\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ during the ongoing cangrelor infusion, transitioning to oral therapy without waiting for cangrelor discontinuation.**\nThis strategy is based on the different binding sites of the two drugs. Cangrelor is an orthosteric antagonist, binding to the same site as the natural ligand ADP. Ticagrelor is an allosteric inhibitor, binding to a different site on the P2Y₁₂ receptor. Because they do not bind to the same site, they do not directly compete for receptor access. Ticagrelor can bind to its allosteric site even when cangrelor is occupying the orthosteric site. Therefore, ticagrelor, which is directly acting and does not require metabolic activation, can be administered during the cangrelor infusion to establish its own inhibitory effect without pharmacodynamic antagonism. This allows for a smooth transition without a gap in P2Y₁₂ inhibition.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Double the clopidogrel loading dose to $1200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ during the cangrelor infusion to overcome competitive occupancy by mass action.**\nThis is an extension of strategy A. The rationale is to increase the concentration of CAM to out-compete cangrelor. However, the antagonism is profound. With $[L_{\\mathrm{cang}}]/K_{d,\\mathrm{cang}} = 100$, cangrelor has a massive competitive advantage. Even if doubling the clopidogrel dose doubled the peak concentration of its active metabolite, it is highly unlikely to generate a $[L_{\\mathrm{CAM}}]/K_{d,\\mathrm{CAM}}$ term large enough to displace a significant amount of cangrelor. More fundamentally, the problem for an irreversible inhibitor is not just reducing occupancy by the reversible competitor, but finding a free receptor. With $\\theta_{\\mathrm{free}} \\approx 0.01$, the number of available sites is minuscule. The short-lived CAM will be cleared before it has a sufficient opportunity to bind. This strategy still results in significant pharmacodynamic antagonism and is an inefficient use of the drug.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Discontinue cangrelor and then immediately administer a clopidogrel loading dose of $600\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ to allow its active metabolite to bind irreversibly when receptors become free.**\nThis strategy is analogous to option B, but uses clopidogrel instead of prasugrel. The principle is identical: temporal separation to avoid competition. The cangrelor infusion is stopped, and its concentration rapidly declines, freeing up P2Y₁₂ receptors. Clopidogrel is then administered. By the time its active metabolite is formed and reaches the platelets, the receptors are unoccupied and available for irreversible binding. This strategy successfully avoids pharmacodynamic antagonism at the receptor site.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCE}$$", "id": "4529883"}]}
