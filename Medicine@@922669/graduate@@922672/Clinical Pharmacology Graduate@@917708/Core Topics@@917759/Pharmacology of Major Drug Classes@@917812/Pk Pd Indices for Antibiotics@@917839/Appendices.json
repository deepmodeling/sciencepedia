This implies that the clearance, $CL$, is a constant value and does not change with time or concentration. Therefore, $CL$ can be factored out of the integral:\n$$ A_e = CL \\int_{0}^{T} C(t) \\,dt $$\nThe fundamental definition of the area under the concentration-time curve from $t=0$ to $t=T$, denoted as $AUC_{0-T}$, is the time integral of the plasma concentration.\n$$ AUC_{0-T} = \\int_{0}^{T} C(t) \\,dt $$\nBy substituting the definition of $AUC_{0-T}$ into the equation for $A_e$, we arrive at a cornerstone equation in pharmacokinetics:\n$$ A_e = CL \\cdot AUC_{0-T} $$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express $AUC_{0-T}$ in terms of the amount eliminated and clearance:\n$$ AUC_{0-T} = \\frac{A_e}{CL} $$\nThe problem specifies a dosing interval of $T = 24 \\, \\text{h}$. It also provides a critical assumption: at steady dosing over this interval, the total amount of drug eliminated over $24$ hours is equal to the total systemic daily dose. The total systemic daily dose, $D_{sys}$, is the amount of drug that reaches the systemic circulation. It is calculated by multiplying the administered dose by the systemic bioavailability, $F$.\nThe given total daily dose is $1.5 \\, \\text{g}$, and the bioavailability is complete, meaning $F=1$.
