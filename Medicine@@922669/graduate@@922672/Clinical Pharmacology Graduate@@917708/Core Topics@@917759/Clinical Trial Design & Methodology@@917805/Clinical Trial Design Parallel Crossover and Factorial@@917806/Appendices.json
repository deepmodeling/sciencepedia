It is a standard, well-posed problem in biostatistics concerning the a priori sample size calculation for a two-arm parallel-group clinical trial with a continuous endpoint. The problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and uses precise, objective language. All necessary parameters and assumptions are provided for a formal derivation.\n\nThe derivation of the per-group sample size $n$ proceeds as follows.\n\n**1. Problem Formulation and Hypotheses**\n\nLet $\\mu_{1}$ and $\\mu_{2}$ be the true population means for the new drug arm and the control arm, respectively. Let $\\sigma^{2}$ be the common variance of the continuous endpoint in both populations. We are planning a trial with $n$ subjects per arm, for a total of $2n$ subjects. Let $\\bar{X}_{1}$ and $\\bar{X}_{2}$ be the sample means from the two arms. The primary goal is to test for a difference between the means.\n\nThe two-sided null and alternative hypotheses are:\n$$H_{0}: \\mu_{1} - \\mu_{2} = 0 \\quad (\\text{no difference})$$\n$$H_{a}: \\mu_{1} - \\mu_{2} \\neq 0 \\quad (\\text{a difference exists})$$\n\n**2. Test Statistic and its Distribution**\n\nThe point estimator for the difference in means $\\Delta = \\mu_{1} - \\mu_{2}$ is $\\hat{\\Delta} = \\bar{X}_{1} - \\bar{X}_{2}$. The necessary regularity assumptions, as stated in the problem, are:\n-   Subjects are allocated equally, so $n_{1} = n_{2} = n$.\n-   Outcomes are independent within and across groups.\n-   The outcome variance is common and constant across groups, $\\sigma^{2}$.\n-   The sample size $n$ is large enough to justify the use of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).\n\nUnder these assumptions, the sample means $\\bar{X}_{1}$ and $\\bar{X}_{2}$ are approximately normally distributed:\n$$\\bar{X}_{1} \\sim N\\left(\\mu_{1}, \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n}\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\bar{X}_{2} \\sim N\\left(\\mu_{2}, \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n}\\right)$$\nDue to the independence of the two arms, their difference $\\hat{\\Delta} = \\bar{X}_{1} - \\bar{X}_{2}$ is also normally distributed:\n$$E[\\hat{\\Delta}] = E[\\bar{X}_{1}] - E[\\bar{X}_{2}] = \\mu_{1} - \\mu_{2}$$\n$$Var(\\hat{\\Delta}) = Var(\\bar{X}_{1}) + Var(\\bar{X}_{2}) = \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n} = \\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}$$\nThus, the distribution of the sample mean difference is:\n$$\\hat{\\Delta} \\sim N\\left(\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{2}, \\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}\\right)$$\nWe can construct a standardized test statistic $Z$ by subtracting the hypothesized mean difference (under $H_0$) and dividing by the standard error:\n$$Z = \\frac{(\\bar{X}_{1} - \\bar{X}_{2}) - 0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}}}$$\nUnder the null hypothesis $H_{0}: \\mu_{1} - \\mu_{2} = 0$, this statistic follows a standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$.\n\n**3. Construction of the Rejection Region (Type I Error)**\n\nThe Type I error rate, $\\alpha$, is the probability of rejecting $H_{0}$ when it is true. For a two-sided test at significance level $\\alpha$, we reject $H_{0}$ if the test statistic falls in the extreme tails of its null distribution. The critical values are determined by the quantiles of the standard normal distribution. Let $z_{q}$ be the value such that $P(Z \\le z_{q}) = q$ for a standard normal variable $Z$. We reject $H_{0}$ if $|Z| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$.\n\nThe rejection region can be expressed in terms of the observed difference $\\bar{X}_{1} - \\bar{X}_{2}$:\n$$|\\bar{X}_{1} - \\bar{X}_{2}| > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}}$$\nLet the critical boundary value be $C = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}}$. We reject $H_0$ if $\\bar{X}_{1} - \\bar{X}_{2} > C$ or if $\\bar{X}_{1} - \\bar{X}_{2} < -C$.\n\n**4. Power Requirement (Type II Error)**\n\nThe Type II error rate, $\\beta$, is the probability of failing to reject $H_{0}$ when it is false. The power of the test is $1-\\beta$, which is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_{0}$ when the alternative hypothesis $H_{a}$ is true. The design requires a target power of $1-\\beta$ to detect a specific clinically meaningful difference of magnitude $\\delta > 0$. We formulate a specific alternative hypothesis for this power calculation: $H_{a}: |\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{2}| = \\delta$.\n\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume the specific alternative is $\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{2} = \\delta$. Under this alternative, the distribution of the sample mean difference is:\n$$\\hat{\\Delta} = \\bar{X}_{1} - \\bar{X}_{2} \\sim N\\left(\\delta, \\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}\\right)$$\nThe power is the probability that the observed difference falls into the rejection region determined in the previous step, given that $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = \\delta$:\n$$1 - \\beta = P\\left(|\\bar{X}_{1} - \\bar{X}_{2}| > C \\,\\middle|\\, \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = \\delta\\right)$$\n$$1 - \\beta = P\\left(\\bar{X}_{1} - \\bar{X}_{2} > C \\,\\middle|\\, \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = \\delta\\right) + P\\left(\\bar{X}_{1} - \\bar{X}_{2} < -C \\,\\middle|\\, \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = \\delta\\right)$$\nFor a well-powered study designed to detect a positive difference $\\delta$, the probability of observing a large negative difference, $P(\\bar{X}_{1} - \\bar{X}_{2} < -C)$, is negligible. We can therefore approximate the power by considering only the upper tail of the rejection region:\n$$1 - \\beta \\approx P\\left(\\bar{X}_{1} - \\bar{X}_{2} > C \\,\\middle|\\, \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = \\delta\\right)$$\nTo evaluate this probability, we standardize the expression under $H_a$ by subtracting its mean ($\\delta$) and dividing by its standard error ($\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}$):\n$$1 - \\beta = P\\left(\\frac{(\\bar{X}_{1} - \\bar{X}_{2}) - \\delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}}} > \\frac{C - \\delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}}}\\right)$$\nThe standardized term on the left follows a standard normal distribution. So we have:\n$$1 - \\beta = P\\left(Z > \\frac{C - \\delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}}}\\right)$$\nwhere $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$. We know that for a standard normal variable, $P(Z > -z_{1-\\beta}) = 1-\\beta$. Therefore, the argument of the probability must satisfy:\n$$-z_{1-\\beta} = \\frac{C - \\delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}}}$$\nSubstituting $C = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}}$ into this equation:\n$$-z_{1-\\beta} = \\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}} - \\delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}}} = z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}}}$$\n\n**5. Derivation of Sample Size $n$**\n\nWe now rearrange the equation to solve for the per-group sample size $n$:\n$$\\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^{2}}{n}}} = z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta}$$\n$$\\frac{\\delta \\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}} = z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta}$$\nIsolating $\\sqrt{n}$:\n$$\\sqrt{n} = \\frac{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})}{\\delta}$$\nSquaring both sides gives the final closed-form expression for the minimum per-group sample size:\n$$n = \\frac{2\\sigma^{2}(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^{2}}{\\delta^{2}}$$\nThis provides the number of subjects required in each arm of the trial. Since the number of subjects must be an integer, in practice one would take the ceiling of this value.\n\n**6. Interpretation of Parameters in Clinical Trial Context**\n\nEach parameter in the sample size formula has a direct and intuitive interpretation for trial design:\n\n-   **$\\alpha$ (Significance Level / Type I Error Rate):** This is the risk a trialist is willing to accept of making a false positive claim, i.e., concluding the new drug is different from the control when it is not. A smaller $\\alpha$ (e.g., $0.01$ vs. $0.05$) demands stronger evidence, which increases the critical value $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ and thus requires a larger sample size $n$.\n-   **$\\beta$ (Type II Error Rate):** This is the risk of making a false negative claim, i.e., failing to detect a true drug effect of size $\\delta$. Power is $1-\\beta$. A smaller $\\beta$ (e.g., $0.10$ for $90\\%$ power vs. $0.20$ for $80\\%$ power) means a lower tolerance for missing a true effect. This increases the value of $z_{1-\\beta}$ and thus requires a larger sample size $n$.\n-   **$\\sigma^{2}$ (Outcome Variance):** This represents the inherent biological variability or measurement \"noise\" of the endpoint in the study population. Higher variability (larger $\\sigma^{2}$) obscures the \"signal\" (the true mean difference). The formula shows that $n$ is directly proportional to $\\sigma^{2}$; if the patient outcomes are twice as variable, the trial needs twice as many subjects to distinguish the signal from the noise with the same confidence and power.\n-   **$\\delta$ (Clinically Meaningful Difference):** This is the \"signal\" the trial is designed to detect. It is the smallest difference between the new drug and control that would be considered clinically relevant and justify a change in medical practice. The formula shows that $n$ is inversely proportional to $\\delta^2$. This means that detecting a very small, subtle effect requires a substantially larger sample size than detecting a large, obvious effect. Doubling the effect size one wishes to detect reduces the required sample size by a factor of four.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{n = \\frac{2\\sigma^{2}(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^{2}}{\\delta^{2}}} $$", "id": "4541326"}, {"introduction": "Factorial designs offer an elegant and efficient way to evaluate multiple interventions in a single study.

Verdict**\nThe problem is valid.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Sample Size Formula\n\nThe derivation proceeds in several logical steps:\n1.  Define the estimator for the main effect $\\delta_{A}$.\n2.  Determine the sampling distribution of this estimator.\n3.  Construct the test statistic for the null hypothesis $H_{0}: \\delta_{A}=0$.\n4.  Establish the power equation based on the distributions of the test statistic under the null and alternative hypotheses.\n5.  Solve the power equation for the per-cell sample size $n$.\n\nLet $\\bar{Y}_{ab}$ be the sample mean of the $n$ participants in the cell corresponding to intervention level $a$ for factor $A$ and level $b$ for factor $B$. Based on the problem statement, the outcomes are independent, and for large $n$, the Central Limit Theorem supports the Normal approximation for the sample means. The variance of the outcome for any participant is $\\sigma^2$. Therefore, the sampling distribution of each cell mean is:\n$$\n\\bar{Y}_{ab} \\sim N\\left(\\mu_{ab}, \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n}\\right)\n$$\nThe four sample means $\\bar{Y}_{A{+},B{+}}$, $\\bar{Y}_{A{+},B{-}}$, $\\bar{Y}_{A{-},B{+}}$, and $\\bar{Y}_{A{-},B{-}}$ are independent.\n\n**1. Estimator for $\\delta_{A}$**\nThe natural estimator for the main effect $\\delta_{A}$, denoted $\\hat{\\delta}_{A}$, is obtained by replacing the true means $\\mu_{ab}$ in the definition with their sample estimates $\\bar{Y}_{ab}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\delta}_{A} = \\left(\\frac{\\bar{Y}_{A{+},B{+}}+\\bar{Y}_{A{+},B{-}}}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\bar{Y}_{A{-},B{+}}+\\bar{Y}_{A{-},B{-}}}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\n**2. Sampling Distribution of $\\hat{\\delta}_{A}$**\nSince $\\hat{\\delta}_{A}$ is a linear combination of independent Normal random variables, it is also Normally distributed.\nThe expected value of $\\hat{\\delta}_{A}$ is:\n$$\nE[\\hat{\\delta}_{A}] = \\left(\\frac{E[\\bar{Y}_{A{+},B{+}}]+E[\\bar{Y}_{A{+},B{-}}]}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{E[\\bar{Y}_{A{-},B{+}}]+E[\\bar{Y}_{A{-},B{-}}]}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nE[\\hat{\\delta}_{A}] = \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{A{+},B{+}}+\\mu_{A{+},B{-}}}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{A{-},B{+}}+\\mu_{A{-},B{-}}}{2}\\right) = \\delta_{A}\n$$\nThus, $\\hat{\\delta}_{A}$ is an unbiased estimator of $\\delta_{A}$.\n\nThe variance of $\\hat{\\delta}_{A}$, using the independence of the four cell means, is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\delta}_{A}) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\bar{Y}_{A{+},B{+}} + \\frac{1}{2}\\bar{Y}_{A{+},B{-}} - \\frac{1}{2}\\bar{Y}_{A{-},B{+}} - \\frac{1}{2}\\bar{Y}_{A{-},B{-}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\delta}_{A}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{A{+},B{+}}) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{A{+},B{-}}) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{A{-},B{+}}) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}\\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{A{-},B{-}})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\delta}_{A}) = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n}\\right) = 4\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n}\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n}\n$$\nSo, the sampling distribution of the estimator is $\\hat{\\delta}_{A} \\sim N\\left(\\delta_{A}, \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n}\\right)$.\n\n**3. Test Statistic**\nTo test the null hypothesis $H_{0}: \\delta_{A}=0$, we formulate a Z-statistic. The standard error of $\\hat{\\delta}_{A}$ is $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\delta}_{A}) = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\delta}_{A})} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$.\n$$\nZ = \\frac{\\hat{\\delta}_{A} - 0}{\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\delta}_{A})} = \\frac{\\hat{\\delta}_{A}}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\n$$\nUnder $H_{0}: \\delta_{A}=0$, the mean of $\\hat{\\delta}_{A}$ is $0$, so the test statistic $Z$ follows the standard Normal distribution, $Z \\sim N(0,1)$.\n\n**4. Power Equation**\nFor a two-sided test with a Type I error rate of $\\alpha$, we reject $H_{0}$ if $|Z| > \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha/2)$, where $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ is the standard Normal cumulative distribution function and $\\Phi^{-1}(\\cdot)$ is its inverse (the quantile function).\n\nPower, $1-\\beta$, is the probability of rejecting $H_{0}$ when the alternative hypothesis is true, i.e., when the true effect is $\\delta_{A} \\neq 0$. Under this alternative, the distribution of the estimator is $\\hat{\\delta}_{A} \\sim N(\\delta_{A}, \\sigma^{2}/n)$. The distribution of the test statistic $Z$ is:\n$$\nE[Z] = E\\left[\\frac{\\hat{\\delta}_{A}}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\right] = \\frac{E[\\hat{\\delta}_{A}]}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{\\delta_{A}}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Var}[Z] = \\text{Var}\\left[\\frac{\\hat{\\delta}_{A}}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\right] = \\frac{\\text{Var}[\\hat{\\delta}_{A}]}{(\\sigma/\\sqrt{n})^{2}} = \\frac{\\sigma^{2}/n}{\\sigma^{2}/n} = 1\n$$\nSo, under the alternative hypothesis, $Z \\sim N\\left(\\frac{\\delta_{A}\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma}, 1\\right)$.\n\nThe power is $1-\\beta = P(|Z| > \\Phi^{-1}(1-\\alpha/2) | \\delta_{A} \\neq 0)$.

This relationship is expressed by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k_e C(t) $$\nwhere $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant, a positive value. The negative sign indicates that the concentration decreases over time.\n\nTo find the concentration as a function of time, we integrate this differential equation. Let the concentration at an initial time $t=0$ be $C_0$.\n$$ \\int_{C_0}^{C(t)} \\frac{dC}{C} = \\int_{0}^{t} -k_e dt' $$\n$$ \\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C_0) = -k_e t $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right) = -k_e t $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the equation for concentration over time during the elimination phase:\n$$ C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-k_e t) $$\nThe problem states that the washout period begins immediately after the peak concentration, $C_{\\text{peak}}$, is reached. We can set the start of the washout period as our reference time $t=0$. Therefore, the initial concentration for the washout phase is $C_0 = C_{\\text{peak}}$. The concentration after a washout duration of $t_w$ is:\n$$ C(t_w) = C_{\\text{peak}} \\exp(-k_e t_w) $$\nThe problem requires us to find the minimal washout duration, $t_w$, such that the concentration falls to less than $5\\%$ of $C_{\\text{peak}}$. We find this minimal time by setting the concentration at time $t_w$ to be exactly equal to $5\\%$ of $C_{\\text{peak}}$:\n$$ C(t_w) = 0.05 \\times C_{\\text{peak}} $$\nSubstituting this into the kinetic equation yields:\n$$ 0.05 \\times C_{\\text{peak}} = C_{\\text{peak}} \\exp(-k_e t_w) $$\nThe term $C_{\\text{peak}}$ cancels from both sides, demonstrating that the absolute peak concentration is not needed for this calculation.\n$$ 0.05 = \\exp(-k_e t_w) $$\nTo solve for $t_w$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln(0.05) = -k_e t_w $$\n$$ t_w = -\\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{k_e} = \\frac{\\ln(1/0.05)}{k_e} = \\frac{\\ln(20)}{k_e} $$\nThe next step is to relate the elimination rate constant, $k_e$, to the given terminal half-life, $t_{1/2}$. The half-life is defined as the time required for the drug concentration to decrease to half of its initial value. Using the kinetic equation with $C(t_{1/2}) = 0.5 \\times C_0$:\n$$ 0.5 \\times C_0 = C_0 \\exp(-k_e t_{1/2}) $$\n$$ 0.5 = \\exp(-k_e t_{1/2}) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\ln(0.5) = -k_e t_{1/2} $$\n$$ -\\ln(2) = -k_e t_{1/2} $$\nSolving for $k_e$:\n$$ k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} $$\nNow we substitute this expression for $k_e$ back into our equation for $t_w$:\n$$ t_w = \\frac{\\ln(20)}{\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\\right)} = t_{1/2} \\frac{\\ln(20)}{\\ln(2)} $$\nThis equation gives the washout duration in terms of the half-life. We are given $t_{1/2} = 12$ h.\n$$ t_w = 12 \\frac{\\ln(20)}{\\ln(2)} \\text{ h} $$\nThe term $\\frac{\\ln(20)}{\\ln(2)}$ can be expressed as $\\log_2(20)$, which represents the number of half-lives required to achieve the desired concentration reduction. Let's calculate its value:\n$$ \\frac{\\ln(20)}{\\ln(2)} \\approx \\frac{2.995732}{0.693147} \\approx 4.321928 $$\nSo, the washout duration in hours is:\n$$ t_w \\approx 12 \\times 4.321928 \\text{ h} \\approx 51.863136 \\text{ h} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in units of days. Since there are $24$ hours in one day, we convert the duration:\n$$ t_w (\\text{days}) = \\frac{t_w (\\text{h})}{24 \\text{ h/day}} = \\frac{51.863136}{24} \\text{ days} \\approx 2.160964 \\text{ days} $$\nFinally, we must round the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ t_w \\approx 2.161 \\text{ days} $$\nThis result signifies that a washout period of at least $2.161$ days is required to ensure that any residual drug concentration from the first treatment period is less than $5\\%$ of the peak value, thereby minimizing the risk of a carryover effect influencing the results of the second treatment period.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.161}$$", "id": "4541353"}]}
