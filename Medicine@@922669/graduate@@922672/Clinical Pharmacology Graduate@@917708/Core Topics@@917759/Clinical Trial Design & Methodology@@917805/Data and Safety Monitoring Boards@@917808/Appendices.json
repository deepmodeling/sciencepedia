At a given dose level, each enrolled participant has the same, independent probability $p$ of experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), where DLT is defined according to prespecified clinical criteria. The escalation rule is as follows: enroll an initial cohort of three participants; if $0$ DLTs are observed in these three, escalate to the next higher dose; if exactly $1$ DLT is observed, enroll an additional three participants at the same dose for a total of six; escalate if the total number of DLTs among the six is at most $1$; otherwise, do not escalate. Assume that all DLT outcomes are independent and identically distributed Bernoulli random variables with parameter $p$ at this dose and that the outcomes in the first and second cohorts are independent.\n\nUsing only the definitions and properties of Bernoulli trials, the binomial distribution, and the law of total probability, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the probability of escalation at this dose as a function of $p$.

Let $E$ denote the event that escalation to the next higher dose occurs. We will derive an expression for $P(E)$.\n\nThe process begins by enrolling a cohort of three participants. Let $N_1$ be the number of DLTs observed in this first cohort. Since each participant is an independent Bernoulli trial with success probability $p$ (where \"success\" is observing a DLT), the random variable $N_1$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n=3$ and $p$. The probability mass function for $N_1$ is given by:\n$$P(N_1=k) = \\binom{3}{k} p^k (1-p)^{3-k} \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$$\n\nThe escalation rule specifies distinct, mutually exclusive pathways. We can use the law of total probability to find $P(E)$ by summing the probabilities of all pathways that lead to escalation.\n\nThe possible outcomes for $N_1$ are $0$, $1$, $2$, or $3$. Let us analyze the consequences of each outcome according to the rules:\n1.  If $N_1 = 0$ DLTs are observed, the rule states to \"escalate to the next higher dose\".

Let $N_2$ be the number of DLTs in this second cohort. $N_2$ is also a binomial random variable, $N_2 \\sim \\text{Binomial}(3, p)$, and is independent of $N_1$. The rule states to escalate if the total number of DLTs among the six participants is at most $1$. Since we already have $N_1=1$, this condition is met if and only if $N_2=0$. This is a second path to escalation. Let this event be $E_2$.\n3.  If $N_1 \\ge 2$ DLTs are observed, the trial does not escalate at this dose level.

The calculated $\\widehat{\\mathrm{HR}} = 2.142$ suggests that, on average, the risk of an event in the investigational drug group ($Z=1$) is more than double the risk in the control group ($Z=0$). This serves as a potential safety alert.\n\nHowever, this result is predicated on the proportional hazards (PH) assumption, which posits that this hazard ratio is constant over time. If diagnostics (e.g., examination of Schoenfeld residuals) suggest this assumption is violated, the interpretation of this single, summary $\\widehat{\\mathrm{HR}}$ becomes problematic and potentially misleading for several critical reasons:\n\n1.  **Averaging Effect**: A single $\\widehat{\\mathrm{HR}}$ under non-proportional hazards represents a weighted average of the time-varying hazard ratio, $\\mathrm{HR}(t)=\\exp(\\beta(t))$, over the follow-up period. This average may not accurately reflect the true risk at any given time point. For a safety assessment, the pattern of risk is more important than the average. For instance, an increasing $\\mathrm{HR}(t)$ (e.g., from less than $1$ to substantially greater than $1$) indicates a delayed toxicity that an averaged $\\widehat{\\mathrm{HR}}$ might understate or obscure, particularly in an early interim analysis. Conversely, a decreasing $\\mathrm{HR}(t)$ (e.g., from very high initially to near $1$ later) may suggest an acute, manageable toxicity rather than a persistent danger.\n\n2.  **Implications for Safety Monitoring**: The DSMB's foremost concern is patient harm. The non-proportionality of hazards means the safety profile of the investigational drug changes over time. If the hazard ratio is increasing, the drug may appear safe early on, only for a serious safety signal to emerge later in the trial. A decision to continue the trial based on an early, benign-looking average HR could expose later participants to unacceptable risk. The current result of $\\widehat{\\mathrm{HR}} > 2$ is already concerning; knowing the trend of $\\mathrm{HR}(t)$ is paramount to understanding if this risk is immediate, delayed, escalating, or diminishing.\n\n3.  **Invalidation of Standard Group-Sequential Methods**: Group-sequential trial designs, which use pre-specified stopping boundaries (e.g., O'Brien-Fleming), rely on test statistics (like the score/log-rank statistic) whose distributional properties are derived under the PH assumption. When hazards are non-proportional, the statistical power of the standard log-rank test decreases, and the operating characteristics (type I error, power) of the sequential plan can be compromised. A trial might fail to stop for a true effect (either harm or benefit) simply because the chosen test statistic is insensitive to the pattern of non-proportionality.\n\nIn light of non-proportional hazards, the DSMB must not base its recommendation solely on the single $\\widehat{\\mathrm{HR}}$. Instead, it should request and deliberate on more appropriate analyses:\n\n-   **Modeling Time-Varying Effects**: The most direct approach is to abandon the simple Cox model and explicitly model the time-dependent log-hazard ratio, $\\beta(t)$. This can be done by including an interaction term between the treatment indicator and a function of time (e.g., $\\ln(t)$ or splines) in the Cox model, i.e., $h(t \\mid Z) = h_{0}(t) \\exp(\\beta_1 Z + \\beta_2 Z \\cdot g(t))$. A plot of the estimated $\\widehat{\\mathrm{HR}}(t) = \\exp(\\hat{\\beta}_1 + \\hat{\\beta}_2 g(t))$ would provide the DSMB with a dynamic picture of the relative risk, allowing for a much more nuanced safety assessment.\n\n-   **Using Weighted Log-Rank Tests**: The standard log-rank test gives equal weight to all events. The family of Harrington-Fleming weighted log-rank tests ($G^{\\rho, \\gamma}$) allows for differential weighting of early ($\\rho>0$) versus late ($\\gamma>0$) events. If, for example, a test that up-weights late events shows a stronger signal of harm than the standard log-rank test, this provides evidence of an emerging or delayed toxicity. This would be a grave concern for the DSMB.\n\n-   **Considering Alternative Endpoints**: If non-proportionality is severe, comparing survival curves via a hazard ratio may be inappropriate altogether. An alternative is to compare the Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) between arms. RMST is a robust measure of the average event-free time up to a specified time horizon and does not rely on the PH assumption.\n\n**Conclusion for the DSMB**: The interim finding of $\\widehat{\\mathrm{HR}} \\approx 2.14$ is a significant alert. The evidence of non-proportional hazards makes this single number an inadequate and potentially dangerous basis for a decision. The DSMB should immediately request analyses that characterize the time-dependency of the treatment effect. The board's recommendation—whether to continue, modify, or halt the trial for safety—should be based on a comprehensive understanding of how the hazard ratio evolves over the course of patient follow-up.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.142}$$", "id": "4544930"}]}
