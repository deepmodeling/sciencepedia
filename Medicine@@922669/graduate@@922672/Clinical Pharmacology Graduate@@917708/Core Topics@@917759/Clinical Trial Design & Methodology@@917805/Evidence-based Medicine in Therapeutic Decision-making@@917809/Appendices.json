You are asked to use evidence-based medicine in therapeutic decision-making to determine whether, for a target population, therapy is favored on net clinical benefit.\n\nFundamental base and definitions:\n- The absolute risk reduction (ARR) is defined as the control risk minus the treated risk for the outcome the therapy intends to reduce.\n- The absolute risk increase (ARI) is defined as the treated risk minus the control risk for the adverse event the therapy may cause.\n- Relative risk (RR) is the ratio of treated risk to control risk for the outcome of interest.\n\nAssume the following:\n- The baseline (control) one-year risk of ischemic stroke in the target population is $p_{0} = 0.15$.\n- The therapy’s relative risk for ischemic stroke is $RR_{\\text{benefit}} = 0.65$.\n- The baseline (control) one-year risk of major bleeding in the same target population is $h_{0} = 0.05$.\n- The therapy’s relative risk for major bleeding is $RR_{\\text{harm}} = 1.40$.\n- Outcomes (ischemic stroke and major bleeding) are distinct and their risks are independent for the purposes of net risk trade-off calculation.\n\nUsing first-principles definitions of risk and relative risk, derive from the above the analytical expression for the baseline stroke-risk threshold $p_{0}^{*}$ at which the absolute risk reduction in ischemic stroke equals the absolute risk increase in major bleeding.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $p_{0}$ be the baseline (control) risk of ischemic stroke and $p_{1}$ be the risk of ischemic stroke in the treated population.\nLet $h_{0}$ be the baseline (control) risk of major bleeding and $h_{1}$ be the risk of major bleeding in the treated population.\nThe relative risks are given by:\n$$RR_{\\text{benefit}} = \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{0}}$$\n$$RR_{\\text{harm}} = \\frac{h_{1}}{h_{0}}$$\n\nFrom these definitions, we can express the treated risks as:\n$$p_{1} = p_{0} \\times RR_{\\text{benefit}}$$\n$$h_{1} = h_{0} \\times RR_{\\text{harm}}$$\n\nThe absolute risk reduction ($ARR$) for ischemic stroke is defined as the difference between the control risk and the treated risk:\n$$ARR = p_{0} - p_{1}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_{1}$:\n$$ARR = p_{0} - (p_{0} \\times RR_{\\text{benefit}}) = p_{0} (1 - RR_{\\text{benefit}})$$\n\nThe absolute risk increase ($ARI$) for major bleeding is defined as the difference between the treated risk and the control risk:\n$$ARI = h_{1} - h_{0}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $h_{1}$:\n$$ARI = (h_{0} \\times RR_{\\text{harm}}) - h_{0} = h_{0} (RR_{\\text{harm}} - 1)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the baseline stroke-risk threshold, denoted as $p_{0}^{*}$, at which the benefit equals the harm. This is the point of equipoise, where $ARR = ARI$.\n$$p_{0}^{*} (1 - RR_{\\text{benefit}}) = h_{0} (RR_{\\text{harm}} - 1)$$\n\nWe can now solve for $p_{0}^{*}$ to obtain the required analytical expression. Since $RR_{\\text{benefit}} = 0.65  1$, the term $(1 - RR_{\\text{benefit}})$ is non-zero, allowing for division.\n$$p_{0}^{*} = \\frac{h_{0} (RR_{\\text{harm}} - 1)}{1 - RR_{\\text{benefit}}}$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the baseline stroke-risk threshold.\n\nNext, we evaluate $p_{0}^{*}$ numerically using the provided values:\n- $h_{0} = 0.05$\n- $RR_{\\text{harm}} = 1.40$\n- $RR_{\\text{benefit}} = 0.65$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $p_{0}^{*}$:\n$$p_{0}^{*} = \\frac{0.05 (1.40 - 1)}{1 - 0.65}$$\n$$p_{0}^{*} = \\frac{0.05 \\times 0.40}{0.35}$$\n$$p_{0}^{*} = \\frac{0.02}{0.35}$$\n$$p_{0}^{*} = \\frac{2}{35} \\approx 0.057142857...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$p_{0}^{*} \\approx 0.05714$$\n\nFinally, we must interpret whether therapy is favored for the target population, which has an actual baseline stroke risk of $p_{0} = 0.15$. Therapy is favored if the net clinical benefit is positive, meaning the absolute risk reduction from the therapy outweighs the absolute risk increase it causes ($ARR > ARI$).\nThe condition for therapy to be favored is:\n$$p_{0} (1 - RR_{\\text{benefit}}) > h_{0} (RR_{\\text{harm}} - 1)$$\nDividing by the positive term $(1 - RR_{\\text{benefit}})$, we find that therapy is favored if:\n$$p_{0} > \\frac{h_{0} (RR_{\\text{harm}} - 1)}{1 - RR_{\\text{benefit}}}$$\n$$p_{0} > p_{0}^{*}$$\nThe patient's baseline risk $p_{0}$ must be greater than the calculated threshold risk $p_{0}^{*}$ for the therapy to confer a net benefit.\n\nIn this case, the target population's baseline risk is $p_{0} = 0.15$, and the calculated threshold is $p_{0}^{*} \\approx 0.05714$.\nSince $0.15 > 0.05714$, the condition $p_{0} > p_{0}^{*}$ is met.\nTherefore, for this target population, the therapy is favored on net clinical benefit. The reduction in ischemic stroke risk is quantitatively greater than the increase in major bleeding risk.\n\nTo verify explicitly:\nFor $p_{0} = 0.15$, the absolute risk reduction is:\n$$ARR = 0.15 (1 - 0.65) = 0.15 \\times 0.35 = 0.0525$$\nThe absolute risk increase is constant for a given population and is:\n$$ARI = 0.05 (1.40 - 1) = 0.05 \\times 0.40 = 0.0200$$\nSince $ARR = 0.0525$ is greater than $ARI = 0.0200$, there is a positive net clinical benefit of $0.0525 - 0.0200 = 0.0325$, confirming that therapy is favored.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.05714}$$", "id": "4554165"}, {"introduction": "Clinical trials often report outcomes using survival analysis, presenting results like hazard ratios ($HR$) and log-rank statistics which can be abstract.

We are given the survival probability for the control arm at this time, $S_{0}(36) = 0.78$.

This allows us to estimate the effect of the treatment, quantified by the hazard ratio ($HR$), from the provided log-rank test statistics.\n\nThe Cox PH model relates the hazard rate in the treatment group, $h_{\\text{treat}}(t)$, to the hazard rate in the control group, $h_{0}(t)$, via a constant hazard ratio, $HR$:\n$$h_{\\text{treat}}(t) = h_{0}(t) \\cdot HR$$\nThe hazard ratio is defined as $HR = \\exp(\\beta)$, where $\\beta$ is the coefficient for the treatment variable in the Cox model, $h(t|X) = h_0(t)\\exp(\\beta X)$, with $X=1$ for the treatment arm and $X=0$ for the control arm.\n\nUnder the assumption of equivalence between the log-rank test and the score test for the Cox model, the maximum likelihood estimate of the log-hazard ratio, $\\hat{\\beta}$, can be approximated from the observed-minus-expected statistic ($O-E$) and its variance ($V$). The score statistic at $\\beta=0$ is $U(0) = O-E$, and its variance, the Fisher information at $\\beta=0$, is $I(0)=V$. A one-step Newton-Raphson approximation for $\\hat{\\beta}$ starting from $\\beta=0$ is given by:\n$$\\hat{\\beta} \\approx \\frac{U(0)}{I(0)} = \\frac{O-E}{V}$$\nWe are given the values $O-E = -23.5$ and $V = 210.4$.

The survival function $S(t)$ is related to the cumulative hazard function $H(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} h(u) \\,du$ by $S(t) = \\exp(-H(t))$.\nFrom the PH assumption $h_{\\text{treat}}(t) = \\widehat{HR} \\cdot h_{0}(t)$, it follows that the cumulative hazard functions are related by:\n$$H_{\\text{treat}}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} h_{\\text{treat}}(u) \\,du = \\int_{0}^{t} \\widehat{HR} \\cdot h_{0}(u) \\,du = \\widehat{HR} \\cdot H_{0}(t)$$\nTherefore, the survival function for the treatment arm can be expressed in terms of the control arm's survival function:\n$$S_{\\text{treat}}(t) = \\exp(-H_{\\text{treat}}(t)) = \\exp(-\\widehat{HR} \\cdot H_{0}(t))$$\nSince $S_{0}(t) = \\exp(-H_{0}(t))$, we have $H_{0}(t) = -\\ln(S_{0}(t))$.
