[@problem_id:4541847]", "problem": "A sponsor is planning a Phase $3$ randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial of a new analgesic versus placebo in patients with chronic pain. The primary endpoint is a responder endpoint derived from a continuous $0$–$100$ pain severity score. The Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) is defined as an improvement of at least $10$ points from baseline at Week $12$. A patient is classified as a responder if the Week $12$ score improves by at least the MCID from baseline; otherwise, the patient is a non-responder. Randomization is $1{:}1$ within each baseline severity stratum, and the treatment effect is assumed homogeneous across strata on the odds ratio scale.\n\nBaseline severity is stratified as follows, with the proportion of randomized patients in each stratum assumed fixed by design:\n- Stratum $1$ (moderate baseline: baseline score $50$–$69$): weight $w_{1} = 0.55$.\n- Stratum $2$ (severe baseline: baseline score $70$–$100$): weight $w_{2} = 0.45$.\n\nHistorical data suggest the following control-arm responder rates:\n- Control responder probability in Stratum $1$: $p_{C,1} = 0.40$.\n- Control responder probability in Stratum $2$: $p_{C,2} = 0.25$.\n\nPharmacologic and prior trial evidence support a constant treatment odds ratio $\\theta = 1.8$ for the responder endpoint across strata.

All provided information is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and sufficient for deriving a unique solution. The problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts. First, a general formula for the required total sample size $N$ is derived from first principles. Second, this formula is used to compute the numerical value of $N$ based on the given parameters.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Sample Size Formula\n\nThe primary estimand is the weighted average risk difference across strata, defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta \\equiv \\sum_{h=1}^{2} w_{h}\\,\\big(p_{T,h} - p_{C,h}\\big)\n$$\nwhere $p_{T,h}$ and $p_{C,h}$ are the true responder probabilities in the treatment and control arms of stratum $h$, respectively, and $w_h$ is the prespecified weight for stratum $h$.\n\nAn unbiased estimator for $\\Delta$ is given by:\n$$\n\\hat{\\Delta} = \\sum_{h=1}^{2} w_{h}\\,\\big(\\hat{p}_{T,h} - \\hat{p}_{C,h}\\big)\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{p}_{T,h}$ and $\\hat{p}_{C,h}$ are the observed sample proportions of responders in the treatment and control arms of stratum $h$.\n\nThe total sample size is $N$. The number of patients in stratum $h$ is $w_h N$. With $1{:}1$ randomization within each stratum, the sample size per arm in stratum $h$ is $n_h = n_{T,h} = n_{C,h} = w_h N / 2$.\n\nThe variance of the estimator $\\hat{\\Delta}$ is calculated as follows. Since the strata are independent, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{h=1}^{2} w_{h}\\,\\big(\\hat{p}_{T,h} - \\hat{p}_{C,h}\\big)\\right) = \\sum_{h=1}^{2} \\text{Var}\\left(w_{h}\\,\\big(\\hat{p}_{T,h} - \\hat{p}_{C,h}\\big)\\right) = \\sum_{h=1}^{2} w_{h}^2 \\text{Var}\\big(\\hat{p}_{T,h} - \\hat{p}_{C,h}\\big)\n$$\nWithin each stratum, the treatment and control groups are independent. Thus:\n$$\n\\text{Var}\\big(\\hat{p}_{T,h} - \\hat{p}_{C,h}\\big) = \\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_{T,h}) + \\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_{C,h})\n$$\nUsing the large-sample approximation for the variance of a binomial proportion, $\\text{Var}(\\hat{p}) = p(1-p)/n$:\n$$\n\\text{Var}\\big(\\hat{p}_{T,h} - \\hat{p}_{C,h}\\big) = \\frac{p_{T,h}(1-p_{T,h})}{n_{T,h}} + \\frac{p_{C,h}(1-p_{C,h})}{n_{C,h}}\n$$\nSubstituting $n_{T,h} = n_{C,h} = w_h N/2$:\n$$\n\\text{Var}\\big(\\hat{p}_{T,h} - \\hat{p}_{C,h}\\big) = \\frac{p_{T,h}(1-p_{T,h})}{w_h N / 2} + \\frac{p_{C,h}(1-p_{C,h})}{w_h N / 2} = \\frac{2}{w_h N} \\left( p_{T,h}(1-p_{T,h}) + p_{C,h}(1-p_{C,h}) \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta})$:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\sum_{h=1}^{2} w_{h}^2 \\left[ \\frac{2}{w_h N} \\left( p_{T,h}(1-p_{T,h}) + p_{C,h}(1-p_{C,h}) \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\frac{2}{N} \\sum_{h=1}^{2} w_{h} \\left( p_{T,h}(1-p_{T,h}) + p_{C,h}(1-p_{C,h}) \\right)\n$$\nLet's define a variance component $\\sigma_S^2$ that is independent of $N$:\n$$\n\\sigma_S^2 = \\sum_{h=1}^{2} w_{h} \\left( p_{T,h}(1-p_{T,h}) + p_{C,h}(1-p_{C,h}) \\right)\n$$\nSo, $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\frac{2 \\sigma_S^2}{N}$.\n\nThe hypothesis test is for $H_0: \\Delta = 0$ versus $H_1: \\Delta \\neq 0$. The test statistic is $Z = \\hat{\\Delta} / \\sqrt{\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\Delta})}$, which is compared to quantiles of the standard normal distribution. For a two-sided test with a type I error rate of $\\alpha$, we reject $H_0$ if $|Z| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$.\n\nThe power of the test, $1-\\beta$, is the probability of rejecting $H_0$ when $H_1$ is true (i.e., when the true effect is $\\Delta$). For sample size calculation, we assume $\\Delta > 0$ without loss of generality and consider the one-sided rejection boundary. The critical value for $\\hat{\\Delta}$ is $c = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\text{Var}_0(\\hat{\\Delta})}$, where $\\text{Var}_0$ is the variance under $H_0$. Power is the probability that the observed $\\hat{\\Delta}$ exceeds this critical value, evaluated under the alternative hypothesis $H_1$:\n$$\n1-\\beta = P\\left(\\hat{\\Delta} > c \\mid H_1\\right) = P\\left(\\frac{\\hat{\\Delta} - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}_1(\\hat{\\Delta})}} > \\frac{c - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}_1(\\hat{\\Delta})}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\text{Var}_1(\\hat{\\Delta})$ is the variance under $H_1$. The term on the left is a standard normal variable. For the probability to be $1-\\beta$, the argument of the tail probability must be $-z_{1-\\beta}$.\n$$\n\\frac{c - \\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}_1(\\hat{\\Delta})}} = -z_{1-\\beta} \\implies \\Delta - c = z_{1-\\beta} \\sqrt{\\text{Var}_1(\\hat{\\Delta})}\n$$\nSubstituting $c = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\text{Var}_0(\\hat{\\Delta})}$, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\text{Var}_0(\\hat{\\Delta})} + z_{1-\\beta} \\sqrt{\\text{Var}_1(\\hat{\\Delta})}\n$$\nFor large-sample approximations, it is standard to assume $\\text{Var}_0(\\hat{\\Delta}) \\approx \\text{Var}_1(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta})$. This simplifies the equation to:\n$$\n\\Delta = (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta}) \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta})} = (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta}) \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\sigma_S^2}{N}}\n$$\nSolving for the total sample size $N$:\n$$\n\\Delta^2 = (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2 \\frac{2 \\sigma_S^2}{N}\n$$\n$$\nN = \\frac{2 (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2 \\sigma_S^2}{\\Delta^2}\n$$\nThis is the required formula. Substituting the definition of $\\sigma_S^2$:\n$$\nN = \\frac{2 (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{\\Delta^2} \\sum_{h=1}^{2} w_{h} \\left( p_{T,h}(1-p_{T,h}) + p_{C,h}(1-p_{C,h}) \\right)\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Computation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Treatment-Arm Responder Probabilities ($p_{T,h}$)**\nThe relationship between treatment and control odds is $O_{T,h} = \\theta \\cdot O_{C,h}$, where $O = p/(1-p)$ and $\\theta = 1.8$.

It presents a standard sensitivity analysis (tipping point analysis) scenario for handling missing data in a clinical study.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation of the Adjusted Treatment Difference\n\nWe begin by applying the law of total expectation to derive the overall mean outcome in a given treatment arm under a pattern-mixture model. Let $A$ represent a generic treatment arm, either treatment ($T$) or control ($C$). Let $Y_A$ be the continuous endpoint (change from baseline in LDL-C) for arm $A$. Let $M_A$ be a binary indicator variable such that $M_A=1$ if the outcome for a patient in arm $A$ is missing, and $M_A=0$ if it is observed.\n\nThe overall mean outcome in arm $A$, denoted $\\mu_A$, is the expectation of $Y_A$:\n$$ \\mu_A = E[Y_A] $$\nBy the law of total expectation, conditioning on the missingness status $M_A$:\n$$ \\mu_A = E[Y_A | M_A=0] P(M_A=0) + E[Y_A | M_A=1] P(M_A=1) $$\nFrom the problem statement, we identify the following terms:\n- The proportion of patients with missing data in arm $A$ is $p_A$, so $P(M_A=1) = p_A$.\n- Consequently, the proportion of completers is $P(M_A=0) = 1 - p_A$.\n- The mean among completers, $E[Y_A | M_A=0]$, is taken to be the arm-level mean under the Missing At Random (MAR) assumption, which we denote as $\\mu_A^{\\mathrm{MAR}}$. The problem specifies $\\mu_T^{\\mathrm{MAR}} = -35$ and $\\mu_C^{\\mathrm{MAR}} = -28$.\n- Under the MAR assumption, the expected outcome for those with missing data would be the same as for those with observed data: $E_{\\mathrm{MAR}}[Y_A | M_A=1] = E[Y_A | M_A=0] = \\mu_A^{\\mathrm{MAR}}$.\n- The problem defines a Missing Not At Random (MNAR) scenario where the mean for the missing data pattern is shifted by a constant delta-adjustment, $\\delta_A$, relative to its MAR mean. Thus, the MNAR mean for the missing group is:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{MNAR}}[Y_A | M_A=1] = E_{\\mathrm{MAR}}[Y_A | M_A=1] + \\delta_A = \\mu_A^{\\mathrm{MAR}} + \\delta_A $$\n\nSubstituting these quantities back into the law of total expectation gives the adjusted arm-level mean, $\\mu_A(\\delta_A)$, under this specific MNAR model:\n$$ \\mu_A(\\delta_A) = (\\mu_A^{\\mathrm{MAR}})(1 - p_A) + (\\mu_A^{\\mathrm{MAR}} + \\delta_A)(p_A) $$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$ \\mu_A(\\delta_A) = \\mu_A^{\\mathrm{MAR}} - p_A \\mu_A^{\\mathrm{MAR}} + p_A \\mu_A^{\\mathrm{MAR}} + p_A \\delta_A = \\mu_A^{\\mathrm{MAR}} + p_A \\delta_A $$\nApplying this formula to the treatment ($T$) and control ($C$) arms, we get:\n$$ \\mu_T(\\delta_T) = \\mu_T^{\\mathrm{MAR}} + p_T \\delta_T $$\n$$ \\mu_C(\\delta_C) = \\mu_C^{\\mathrm{MAR}} + p_C \\delta_C $$\nThe adjusted treatment difference, $\\Delta(\\delta_T, \\delta_C)$, is the difference between these two adjusted means:\n$$ \\Delta(\\delta_T, \\delta_C) = \\mu_T(\\delta_T) - \\mu_C(\\delta_C) = (\\mu_T^{\\mathrm{MAR}} + p_T \\delta_T) - (\\mu_C^{\\mathrm{MAR}} + p_C \\delta_C) $$\nRearranging the terms to isolate the MAR treatment difference, $\\Delta^{\\mathrm{MAR}} = \\mu_T^{\\mathrm{MAR}} - \\mu_C^{\\mathrm{MAR}}$, yields the desired expression:\n$$ \\Delta(\\delta_T, \\delta_C) = (\\mu_T^{\\mathrm{MAR}} - \\mu_C^{\\mathrm{MAR}}) + p_T \\delta_T - p_C \\delta_C = \\Delta^{\\mathrm{MAR}} + p_T \\delta_T - p_C \\delta_C $$\n\n### Step 2: Calculation of the Standard Error\n\nThe problem specifies using a large-sample normal test for the difference in means and states that the delta-adjustments are treated as fixed constants that do not alter the arm-specific variances. The standard error ($SE$) of the treatment difference estimate $\\Delta$ is calculated based on the arm-specific sample variances ($s_T^2, s_C^2$) and the total randomized sample sizes per arm ($n_T, n_C$), consistent with the intention-to-treat principle.\n\nThe formula for the standard error of the difference between two independent means is:\n$$ SE(\\Delta) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_T^2}{n_T} + \\frac{\\sigma_C^2}{n_C}} $$\nWe estimate the population variances $\\sigma_T^2$ and $\\sigma_C^2$ with the given sample variances $s_T^2$ and $s_C^2$. The problem provides the standard deviations $s_T = 20$ and $s_C = 22$, and the sample sizes $n_T = 225$ and $n_C = 211$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$ SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{s_T^2}{n_T} + \\frac{s_C^2}{n_C}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{20^2}{225} + \\frac{22^2}{211}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{400}{225} + \\frac{484}{211}} $$\nWe can compute the value for use in the next step:\n$$ SE = \\sqrt{1.777\\overline{7} + 2.293838...} = \\sqrt{4.07161616...} \\approx 2.01782459 $$\n\n### Step 3: Tipping Point Analysis\n\nThe tipping point analysis aims to find the value of the delta-adjustment at which the conclusion of the hypothesis test changes. We are testing the null hypothesis $H_0: \\Delta = 0$ against a two-sided alternative at a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$. The test statistic is the $z$-score, calculated as:\n$$ z = \\frac{\\Delta_{\\text{adjusted}}}{SE} $$\nThe tipping point occurs when the absolute value of the $z$-statistic equals the critical value $z_{\\alpha/2}$. For a two-sided test with $\\alpha = 0.05$, the critical value is $z_{0.025} \\approx 1.95996$, which is commonly rounded to $1.96$.\n\nThe specific scenario for this analysis is that the control arm maintains the MAR assumption ($\\delta_C = 0$) and the treatment arm is adjusted by $\\delta_T = \\delta$. The adjusted treatment difference from Step 1 becomes:\n$$ \\Delta(\\delta, 0) = \\Delta^{\\mathrm{MAR}} + p_T \\delta - p_C(0) = \\Delta^{\\mathrm{MAR}} + p_T \\delta $$\nThe problem provides $\\Delta^{\\mathrm{MAR}} = -7$ and $p_T = 0.20$.\n$$ \\Delta(\\delta, 0) = -7 + 0.20 \\delta $$\nThe initial MAR result ($\\delta=0$) gives $\\Delta^{\\mathrm{MAR}}=-7$, which is statistically significant as its $z$-score is $z_0 = \\frac{-7}{SE} \\approx \\frac{-7}{2.0178} \\approx -3.47$, and $|-3.47| > 1.96$. The adjustment $\\delta$ is expected to weaken this result, moving the $z$-score towards the significance boundary. Since the initial $z$-score is negative, the tipping point will be reached when the $z$-score becomes equal to the lower critical value, $-z_{\\alpha/2} = -1.96$. This is consistent with the problem's assumption that the sign of the adjusted difference remains negative.\n\nWe set up the equation for the tipping point:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta(\\delta, 0)}{SE} = -z_{\\alpha/2} $$\n$$ \\frac{-7 + 0.20 \\delta}{SE} = -1.96 $$\nNow, we solve for $\\delta$:\n$$ -7 + 0.20 \\delta = -1.96 \\times SE $$\n$$ 0.20 \\delta = 7 - 1.96 \\times SE $$\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{7 - 1.96 \\times SE}{0.20} $$\nSubstituting the value of $SE \\approx 2.01782459$:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{7 - 1.96 \\times 2.01782459}{0.20} $$\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{7 - 3.9549361964}{0.20} $$\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{3.0450638036}{0.20} $$\n$$ \\delta = 15.225319018 $$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$ \\delta \\approx 15.23 $$\nThe units are $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. This value of $\\delta$ represents the mean difference in LDL-C change from baseline between the dropouts and the completers in the treatment arm that would be required to render the treatment effect just non-significant at the $\\alpha=0.05$ level.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{15.23}\n$$", "id": "4541870"}]}
