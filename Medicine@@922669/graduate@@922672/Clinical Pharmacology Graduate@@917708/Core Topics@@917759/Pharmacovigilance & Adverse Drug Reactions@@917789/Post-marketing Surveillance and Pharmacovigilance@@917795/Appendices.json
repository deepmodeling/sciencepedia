The standard model for this type of bias analysis assumes this homogeneity. Let us denote the baseline risk, i.e., the risk in unexposed individuals without the confounder, as $R_{00} = P(Y=1 \\mid A=0, U=0)$. Then, the risk in exposed individuals without the confounder is $R_{10} = P(Y=1 \\mid A=1, U=0) = RR_{\\text{true}} \\cdot R_{00}$.\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions back into the equations for the observed risks.\n\nFor $R_1^{\\text{obs}}$:\n$$\nR_1^{\\text{obs}} = (RR_{UY} \\cdot P(Y=1 \\mid U=0, A=1)) \\cdot p_1 + P(Y=1 \\mid U=0, A=1) \\cdot (1 - p_1)\n$$\n$$\nR_1^{\\text{obs}} = P(Y=1 \\mid A=1, U=0) \\left[ p_1 \\cdot RR_{UY} + (1 - p_1) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nR_1^{\\text{obs}} = R_{10} \\left[ 1 + p_1(RR_{UY} - 1) \\right]\n$$\n\nFor $R_0^{\\text{obs}}$:\n$$\nR_0^{\\text{obs}} = (RR_{UY} \\cdot P(Y=1 \\mid U=0, A=0)) \\cdot p_0 + P(Y=1 \\mid U=0, A=0) \\cdot (1 - p_0)\n$$\n$$\nR_0^{\\text{obs}} = P(Y=1 \\mid A=0, U=0) \\left[ p_0 \\cdot RR_{UY} + (1 - p_0) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nR_0^{\\text{obs}} = R_{00} \\left[ 1 + p_0(RR_{UY} - 1) \\right]\n$$\n\nNow we can construct the observed risk ratio, $RR_{\\text{obs}}$:\n$$\nRR_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{R_1^{\\text{obs}}}{R_0^{\\text{obs}}} = \\frac{R_{10} \\left[ 1 + p_1(RR_{UY} - 1) \\right]}{R_{00} \\left[ 1 + p_0(RR_{UY} - 1) \\right]}\n$$\nRecognizing that $\\frac{R_{10}}{R_{00}} = \\frac{P(Y=1 \\mid A=1, U=0)}{P(Y=1 \\mid A=0, U=0)} = RR_{\\text{true}}$, we arrive at the desired expression:\n$$\nRR_{\\text{obs}} = RR_{\\text{true}} \\cdot \\frac{1 + p_1(RR_{UY} - 1)}{1 + p_0(RR_{UY} - 1)}\n$$\nThe term multiplying $RR_{\\text{true}}$ is the bias factor due to confounding.\n\nTo find the bias-adjusted estimate $RR_{\\text{true}}$, we rearrange the formula:\n$$\nRR_{\\text{true}} = RR_{\\text{obs}} \\cdot \\frac{1 + p_0(RR_{UY} - 1)}{1 + p_1(RR_{UY} - 1)}\n$$\nWe are given the following values:\n- $RR_{\\text{obs}} = 1.5$\n- $p_1 = P(U=1 \\mid A=1) = 0.35$\n- $p_0 = P(U=1 \\mid A=0) = 0.20$\n- $RR_{UY} = 2.4$\n\nWe can now substitute these values into the derived equation to compute $RR_{\\text{true}}$.\nFirst, let's calculate the components of the bias factor. The term $(RR_{UY} - 1)$ is:\n$$\nRR_{UY} - 1 = 2.4 - 1 = 1.4\n$$\nNow, we calculate the numerator and the denominator of the corrective fraction:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator (corrective term)} = 1 + p_0(RR_{UY} - 1) = 1 + (0.20)(1.4) = 1 + 0.28 = 1.28\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Denominator (corrective term)} = 1 + p_1(RR_{UY} - 1) = 1 + (0.35)(1.4) = 1 + 0.49 = 1.49\n$$\nFinally, we compute $RR_{\\text{true}}$:\n$$\nRR_{\\text{true}} = 1.5 \\cdot \\frac{1.28}{1.49}\n$$\n$$\nRR_{\\text{true}} = 1.5 \\cdot 0.85906040268...\n$$\n$$\nRR_{\\text{true}} = 1.28859060402...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested, we obtain:\n$$\nRR_{\\text{true}} \\approx 1.289\n$$\nThe confounding was positive, as the confounder ($U$) is both a risk factor for the outcome ($RR_{UY} > 1$) and is more prevalent in the exposed group ($p_1 > p_0$). This inflates the observed association, and thus the adjusted, true risk ratio is smaller than the observed risk ratio, which is consistent with our result ($1.289  1.5$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.289}\n$$", "id": "4581818"}]}
