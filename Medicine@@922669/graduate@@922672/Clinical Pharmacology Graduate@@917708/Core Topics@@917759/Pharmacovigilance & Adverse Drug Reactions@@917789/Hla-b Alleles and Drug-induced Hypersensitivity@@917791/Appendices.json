We will proceed with a step-by-step derivation.\n\nThe problem requires us to calculate the total expected number of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions (SCAR) cases in a cohort of $N=10000$ individuals treated with allopurinol. The solution is derived from the principles of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) and the definitions of epidemiological risk.\n\nLet the risk allele be $HLA\\text{-}B^{\\ast}58{:}01$, which we will denote as $A$. Its frequency in the population is given as $p = 0.10$. All other $HLA\\text{-}B$ alleles are aggregated into a single class, which we will denote as $a$. The frequency of this class is $q$. According to the problem statement, the allele frequencies sum to unity:\n$$p + q = 1$$\nFrom this, we can calculate the frequency of the non-risk allele class $a$:\n$$q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$$\n\nThe population is assumed to be in Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium. Under HWE, the expected genotype frequencies for a biallelic locus are given by the terms of the binomial expansion $(p+q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$.\nThe three possible genotypes are:\n1.  Homozygous for the risk allele ($AA$): Frequency $f(AA) = p^2$\n2.  Heterozygous ($Aa$): Frequency $f(Aa) = 2pq$\n3.  Homozygous for the non-risk allele class ($aa$): Frequency $f(aa) = q^2$\n\nWe can calculate these frequencies using the values of $p$ and $q$:\n$$f(AA) = p^2 = (0.10)^2 = 0.01$$\n$$f(Aa) = 2pq = 2(0.10)(0.90) = 0.18$$\n$$f(aa) = q^2 = (0.90)^2 = 0.81$$\nAs a check, the sum of these frequencies is $0.01 + 0.18 + 0.81 = 1.00$.\n\nThe problem defines \"carriers\" as individuals who are either heterozygous ($Aa$) or homozygous ($AA$) for the $HLA\\text{-}B^{\\ast}58{:}01$ allele. \"Non-carriers\" are individuals homozygous for the non-risk allele class ($aa$).\n\nThe frequency of carriers, $f_{\\text{carrier}}$, is the sum of the frequencies of the $AA$ and $Aa$ genotypes:\n$$f_{\\text{carrier}} = f(AA) + f(Aa) = p^2 + 2pq$$\n$$f_{\\text{carrier}} = 0.01 + 0.18 = 0.19$$\nAlternatively, the carrier frequency can be calculated as $1$ minus the non-carrier frequency:\n$$f_{\\text{carrier}} = 1 - f(aa) = 1 - q^2 = 1 - (0.90)^2 = 1 - 0.81 = 0.19$$\n\nThe frequency of non-carriers, $f_{\\text{non-carrier}}$, is the frequency of the $aa$ genotype:\n$$f_{\\text{non-carrier}} = f(aa) = q^2 = 0.81$$\n\nNext, we determine the expected number of individuals in each category within the cohort of size $N = 10000$.\nThe expected number of carriers, $N_{\\text{carrier}}$, is:\n$$N_{\\text{carrier}} = N \\times f_{\\text{carrier}} = 10000 \\times 0.19 = 1900$$\nThe expected number of non-carriers, $N_{\\text{non-carrier}}$, is:\n$$N_{\\text{non-carrier}} = N \\times f_{\\text{non-carrier}} = 10000 \\times 0.81 = 8100$$\nThe sum $N_{\\text{carrier}} + N_{\\text{non-carrier}} = 1900 + 8100 = 10000$, which is the total cohort size $N$.\n\nNow, we incorporate the epidemiological risk parameters. The total expected number of SCAR cases, $C_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the expected cases in the carrier and non-carrier groups.\nThe expected number of cases in a group is the product of the number of individuals in that group and their absolute risk of developing the condition.\n\nThe baseline absolute risk in non-carriers is given as $r_0 = 1.5 \\times 10^{-4}$.\nThe expected number of cases in the non-carrier group, $C_{\\text{non-carrier}}$, is:\n$$C_{\\text{non-carrier}} = N_{\\text{non-carrier}} \\times r_0$$\n\nThe relative risk in carriers is given as $\\mathrm{RR} = 100$.

The use of concepts like sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV is standard in evaluating diagnostic and screening tests.

The question is structured to allow for a unique and stable set of solutions for each part.\n-   **Objective**: The language is precise and quantitative. It is free of subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the full solution and analysis.\n\n### Derivations\n\nFirst, we derive key probabilities from the givens.\nThe prior probability of not developing SCAR is:\n$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.0005 = 0.9995$.\n\nThe information given corresponds to standard test performance metrics:\n-   The sensitivity of the test (allele as a marker for the disease) is $P(T|D) = 0.85$.\n-   The probability of a positive test in a non-diseased person is $P(T|D^c) = 0.10$.\n-   The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test in a non-diseased person: $P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - P(T|D^c) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n\nTo calculate PPV and NPV, we first need the overall probability of a positive test, $P(T)$, using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$$\n$$P(T) = (0.85)(0.0005) + (0.10)(0.9995)$$\n$$P(T) = 0.000425 + 0.09995 = 0.100375$$\nThe probability of a negative test is:\n$P(T^c) = 1 - P(T) = 1 - 0.100375 = 0.899625$.\n\nNow we can calculate PPV and NPV.\n**Positive Predictive Value (PPV):**\n$$PPV = P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)} = \\frac{0.000425}{0.100375} \\approx 0.004234_$$\n\n**Negative Predictive Value (NPV):**\n$$NPV = P(D^c|T^c) = \\frac{P(T^c|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^c)} = \\frac{(0.90)(0.9995)}{0.899625} = \\frac{0.89955}{0.899625} \\approx 0.9999166_$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In this context, sensitivity is the probability that the genotyping test is positive among patients who would develop allopurinol-induced SCAR if exposed.**\n\nThe definition of sensitivity for a diagnostic test is the probability of a positive test result ($T$) given that the individual has the disease ($D$), which is written as $P(T|D)$. The statement correctly maps \"genotyping test is positive\" to the test result and \"would develop...SCAR if exposed\" to the disease state. This matches the definition of sensitivity.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Specificity is the probability that a patient will not develop SCAR given a negative genotyping test.**\n\nThe definition of specificity is the probability of a negative test result ($T^c$) given that the individual does not have the disease ($D^c$), which is written as $P(T^c|D^c)$. The statement describes \"the probability that a patient will not develop SCAR [$D^c$] given a negative genotyping test [$T^c$]\". This is the probability $P(D^c|T^c)$, which is the definition of Negative Predictive Value (NPV), not specificity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The PPV in this population is approximately $0.4\\%$, meaning that among test-positive patients, about $4$ in $1000$ would have developed SCAR if they had been exposed to allopurinol.**\n\nFrom our calculation, $PPV \\approx 0.004234$.\nAs a percentage, this is $0.004234 \\times 100\\% = 0.4234\\%$, which is well-approximated by $0.4\\%$.\nAs a rate, this is $0.004234 \\times 1000 = 4.234$ per $1000$ people, which is well-approximated by $4$ in $1000$. The interpretation of PPV provided in the option is also correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The NPV is approximately $99.99\\%$, which implies a residual SCAR risk of about $1$ in $12{,}000$ among test-negative patients if exposed.**\n\nFrom our calculation, $NPV \\approx 0.9999166$. As a percentage, this is $99.99166\\%$, which is well-approximated by $99.99\\%$.\nThe residual SCAR risk among test-negative patients is the probability of developing SCAR ($D$) given a negative test ($T^c$), which is $P(D|T^c)$.\n$P(D|T^c) = 1 - P(D^c|T^c) = 1 - NPV \\approx 1 - 0.9999166 = 0.0000834$.\nTo express this as \"1 in X\", we calculate $X = 1 / 0.0000834 \\approx 11990$. This is well-approximated by $12{,}000$. Both parts of the statement are accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. If all test-positive patients avoid allopurinol, the proportion of SCAR cases prevented among patients who would otherwise have been exposed will be approximately equal to the test’s specificity.**\n\nThe total number of SCAR cases that would occur in a population without screening is proportional to the overall risk, $P(D)$.\nThe screening strategy prevents SCAR cases that would have occurred in test-positive patients. The number of such cases is proportional to $P(D \\cap T)$.\nThe proportion of cases prevented is the ratio of prevented cases to total cases:\n$$\\text{Proportion prevented} = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(D)}$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(D \\cap T) = P(T|D)P(D)$.\n$$\\text{Proportion prevented} = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(D)} = P(T|D)$$\n$P(T|D)$ is the **sensitivity** of the test. In this problem, the sensitivity is $0.85$. The specificity is $P(T^c|D^c) = 0.90$. The statement incorrectly claims the proportion of cases prevented is equal to the specificity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. The expected number needed to genotype to prevent one SCAR case, assuming perfect adherence and complete avoidance of allopurinol in test-positive individuals, is approximately $2350$.**\n\nThe Number Needed to Genotype (NNG) to prevent one adverse event is the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) achieved by the screening strategy.\nThe ARR is the difference between the baseline risk and the risk with the intervention.\nBaseline risk = $P(D) = 0.0005$.\nWith the screening intervention, allopurinol is only given to test-negative patients. The SCAR cases that occur are those in test-negative patients. The population-level risk with screening is thus $P(D \\cap T^c)$.\n$ARR = P(\\text{risk without screening}) - P(\\text{risk with screening}) = P(D) - P(D \\cap T^c)$.\nSince $P(D) = P(D \\cap T) + P(D \\cap T^c)$, the ARR simplifies to the risk in the group that is successfully screened out:\n$ARR = P(D \\cap T)$.\nWe can calculate $P(D \\cap T) = P(T|D)P(D) = (0.85)(0.0005) = 0.000425$.\nThe NNG is the reciprocal of the ARR:\n$$NNG = \\frac{1}{ARR} = \\frac{1}{0.000425} = 2352.94...$$\nThis value is very well-approximated by $2350$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDF}$$", "id": "4559001"}, {"introduction": "In clinical practice, a patient's risk is seldom determined by a single factor.

The target quantity is the patient-level probability $p$ of SCAR within $8$ weeks.

Identify the odds ratios from the problem statement**\n- $OR_1$ for $X_1$ (HLA-B\\*58:01+): $80$\n- $OR_2$ for $X_2$ (CKD $\\ge 3$): $3$\n- $OR_3$ for $X_3$ (per $100$ mg/day dose increment): $1.5$\n- $OR_4$ for $X_4$ (per decade of age): $1.2$\n- The interaction is described as \"when CKD stage $\\ge 3$ ($X_2=1$), each $100$ mg/day dose increment multiplies the odds *further* by $1.3$\". This means the total multiplicative effect of a dose increment when $X_2=1$ is $1.5 \\times 1.3$. This corresponds to an interaction term $X_5 = X_2 \\times X_3$ with an odds ratio of $OR_{\\text{int}} = 1.3$.\n\n**3. Determine the covariate values for the new patient**\n- **HLA status:** HLA-B\\*58:01 positive $\\implies X_1 = 1$.\n- **CKD status:** CKD stage $3$ $\\implies X_2 = 1$.\n- **Dose:** Starting dose is $200$ mg/day. The reference dose is $100$ mg/day. The number of $100$ mg/day increments above the reference is $X_3 = \\frac{200 - 100}{100} = 1$.\n- **Age:** Age is $70$ years. The reference age is $40$ years. The number of decades above the reference is $X_4 = \\frac{70 - 40}{10} = 3$.\n- **Interaction term:** $X_5 = X_2 \\times X_3 = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\n**4. Calculate the odds for the new patient ($\\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}}$)**\nWe multiply the baseline odds by the odds ratios corresponding to the patient's covariate values.\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}} = \\text{Odds}_0 \\times (80)^{X_1} \\times (3)^{X_2} \\times (1.5)^{X_3} \\times (1.2)^{X_4} \\times (1.3)^{X_5} $$\nSubstituting the values for the patient:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}} = \\left(\\frac{10^{-4}}{0.9999}\\right) \\times (80)^1 \\times (3)^1 \\times (1.5)^1 \\times (1.2)^3 \\times (1.3)^1 $$\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}} = \\left(\\frac{10^{-4}}{0.9999}\\right) \\times 80 \\times 3 \\times 1.5 \\times 1.728 \\times 1.3 $$\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}} = \\left(\\frac{10^{-4}}{0.9999}\\right) \\times (240 \\times 1.5 \\times 1.728 \\times 1.3) $$\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}} = \\left(\\frac{10^{-4}}{0.9999}\\right) \\times (360 \\times 1.728 \\times 1.3) $$\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}} = \\left(\\frac{10^{-4}}{0.9999}\\right) \\times (622.08 \\times 1.3) $$\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}} = \\left(\\frac{10^{-4}}{0.9999}\\right) \\times 808.704 $$\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}} \\approx 0.00010001 \\times 808.704 \\approx 0.080878 $$\n\n**5. Convert the new odds back to probability ($p_{\\text{new}}$)**\nThe formula relating probability and odds is $p = \\frac{\\text{Odds}}{1 + \\text{Odds}}$.\n$$ p_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{0.080878}{1 + 0.080878} = \\frac{0.080878}{1.080878} \\approx 0.074826 $$\nThis probability is approximately $0.075$, or $7.5\\%$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Specify a rare-event appropriate, penalized logistic regression for the $8$-week SCAR probability with a log-odds linear predictor that includes $X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4$, and the prespecified interaction $X_5$, code CKD as a binary indicator for stage $\\ge 3$, retain age and dose as continuous scales referenced to $40$ years and $100$ mg/day to avoid information loss, and select variables a priori based on pharmacogenetic and pathophysiological evidence rather than univariate significance. Use an odds-based combination consistent with multiplicative effects to derive patient risk. For the described patient ($X_1=1, X_2=1, X_3=1, X_4=3, X_5=1$), the predicted probability is approximately $p \\approx 0.075$. Justify rare-event bias reduction by using Firth penalization to stabilize coefficient estimates given the expected sparsity of SCAR.**\n\n- **Model & Variables:** Correctly identifies logistic regression with an additive log-odds predictor including all specified main effects and the interaction.\n- **Variable Handling:** Correctly advocates for retaining dose and age on their defined scales, avoiding information loss from dichotomization.\n- **Variable Selection:** Correctly endorses the superior strategy of *a priori* selection based on domain knowledge over data-driven methods like stepwise or univariate screening.\n- **Calculation:** The calculated probability $p \\approx 0.075$ matches our derivation. The covariate vector for the patient is also correctly identified.\n- **Methodology:** The mention of penalized logistic regression (specifically Firth's method) is highly pertinent for rare-event outcomes like SCAR, as it corrects for small-sample bias and issues of separation. This demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the statistical challenges.\n- **Verdict:** This option is methodologically sound, consistent with the problem statement in every aspect, and arrives at the correct numerical result. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Fit a Cox proportional hazards model over the $8$-week window, select variables via backward stepwise at $p<0.05$, dichotomize age at $65$ years and dose at $200$ mg/day, include post-initiation laboratory values to improve fit, and compute the patient’s risk by interpreting the product of hazard ratios as a probability. This yields a patient risk near $p \\approx 0.29$.**\n\n- **Model Choice:** A Cox model is for time-to-event analysis. While related, logistic regression is more direct for estimating cumulative probability over a fixed interval.\n- **Statistical Practice:** Both backward stepwise selection and dichotomization of continuous predictors are statistically poor practices that can lead to model instability and information loss.\n- **Predictors:** Including post-initiation data is inappropriate for a pre-treatment risk prediction model.\n- **Calculation:** Fundamentally flawed. A product of hazard ratios is not a probability. This conceptual error leads to the incorrect risk estimate.\n- **Verdict:** This option is incorrect on multiple grounds: model choice, statistical methodology, and the fundamental interpretation of the model's output. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Construct a naive Bayes classifier by treating HLA-B\\*58:01, CKD, dose, and age as independent likelihood contributors, select variables with univariate screening at $p<0.05$, and sum the given odds ratios as additive effects on risk rather than odds. This gives a patient risk around $p \\approx 0.13$.**\n\n- **Model Choice:** A naive Bayes classifier assumes conditional independence of predictors, which is explicitly violated by the prespecified dose-by-CKD interaction.\n- **Statistical Practice:** Univariate screening is a suboptimal variable selection method.\n- **Calculation:** Fundamentally flawed. Odds ratios are multiplicative on the odds scale, not additive on the risk (probability) scale. Summing odds ratios is mathematically nonsensical. This error leads to the incorrect risk estimate.\n- **Verdict:** This option proposes an incorrect model that violates the problem's assumptions and uses an invalid method for combining risk factors. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Use logistic regression but dichotomize age at $65$ years and dose at $200$ mg/day, drop CKD to avoid multicollinearity with dose, code HLA-B\\*58:01 as a three-level ordinal variable for allele copy number without regard to dominance, prohibit interactions to limit complexity, and choose variables via cross-validated stepwise procedures. Estimate the patient’s risk as $p \\approx 0.03$.**\n\n- **Model Specification:** This option makes several errors contradicting the problem setup. It dichotomizes variables, discards a key predictor (CKD), changes the coding of the primary genetic marker, and incorrectly prohibits the specified interaction. Dropping CKD is particularly egregious as its effect is explicitly given.\n- **Variable Handling:** As noted, dichotomization is poor practice. Re-coding the HLA variable is contrary to the problem statement.\n- **Variable Selection:** While cross-validated stepwise is an improvement over simple stepwise, it remains an automated procedure that is generally inferior to theory-based *a priori* selection for this type of model.\n- **Calculation:** The resulting model is severely misspecified, leading to an incorrect risk estimate.\n- **Verdict:** This option demonstrates poor modeling choices that are inconsistent with the provided information and established best practices. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4559022"}]}
