The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in the principles of probability theory as applied to clinical diagnostics.\n\nFirst, we will derive the expression for $P(H\\,|\\,T^{+})$, which is the probability of a patient having the hypersensitivity susceptibility ($H$) given a positive test result ($T^{+}$). This quantity is defined as the PPV. The derivation will start from the axiomatic definition of conditional probability.\n\nBy the definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$ P(H\\,|\\,T^{+}) = \\frac{P(H \\cap T^{+})}{P(T^{+})} $$\nThe numerator, $P(H \\cap T^{+})$, can be expressed using the definition of conditional probability for $P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H)$:\n$$ P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H) = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\cap H)}{P(H)} $$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$ P(H \\cap T^{+}) = P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H) P(H) $$\nThis term represents the joint probability of a true positive result.\n\nNext, we address the denominator, $P(T^{+})$. We use the law of total probability. The sample space of patients can be partitioned into two mutually exclusive and exhaustive events: those who have the susceptibility ($H$) and those who do not ($H^{c}$). Therefore, the event $T^{+}$ can be written as the union of two disjoint events: $(T^{+} \\cap H)$ and $(T^{+} \\cap H^{c})$.\n$$ P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\cap H) + P(T^{+} \\cap H^{c}) $$\nWe have already expressed the first term, $P(T^{+} \\cap H)$. The second term, $P(T^{+} \\cap H^{c})$, can be similarly expressed using the definition of conditional probability for $P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H^{c})$:\n$$ P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H^{c}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\cap H^{c})}{P(H^{c})} $$\nRearranging gives:\n$$ P(T^{+} \\cap H^{c}) = P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H^{c}) P(H^{c}) $$\nThis term represents the joint probability of a false positive result.\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the equation for $P(T^{+})$:\n$$ P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H) P(H) + P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H^{c}) P(H^{c}) $$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into the original equation for $P(H\\,|\\,T^{+})$:\n$$ P(H\\,|\\,T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H) P(H)}{P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H) P(H) + P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H^{c}) P(H^{c})} $$\nThis is the desired expression, commonly known as Bayes' theorem for this context.\n\nThe problem provides a value for specificity, $P(T^{-}\\,|\\,H^{c})$, but the derived formula requires $P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H^{c})$. Since a test result is either positive ($T^{+}$) or negative ($T^{-}$), these events are complementary for a given subpopulation. Thus, for the subpopulation without the susceptibility ($H^{c}$), we have:\n$$ P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H^{c}) + P(T^{-}\\,|\\,H^{c}) = 1 $$\nTherefore, the false positive rate, $P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H^{c})$, can be expressed in terms of the specificity:\n$$ P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H^{c}) = 1 - P(T^{-}\\,|\\,H^{c}) $$\nSubstituting this into our derived formula gives the PPV in terms of the standard clinical test characteristics: sensitivity ($P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H)$), specificity ($P(T^{-}\\,|\\,H^{c})$), and prevalence ($P(H)$). The term $P(H^c)$ is simply $1-P(H)$.\n\nThe interpretation of $P(H\\,|\\,T^{+})$ as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is standard in clinical epidemiology. It answers the crucial clinical question: \"Given that my patient tested positive, what is the probability that they actually have the condition?\"\n\nNow, we compute the PPV for the given values:\nPrevalence: $P(H) = 0.02$\nSensitivity: $P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H) = 0.95$\nSpecificity: $P(T^{-}\\,|\\,H^{c}) = 0.99$\n\nFrom these values, we derive the other necessary quantities:\nProbability of not having the susceptibility: $P(H^{c}) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98$\nFalse positive rate: $P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H^{c}) = 1 - P(T^{-}\\,|\\,H^{c}) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived formula for PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(H\\,|\\,T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H) P(H)}{P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H) P(H) + P(T^{+}\\,|\\,H^{c}) P(H^{c})} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.95)(0.02)}{(0.95)(0.02) + (0.01)(0.98)} $$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator and the two terms in the denominator:\nNumerator: $0.95 \\times 0.02 = 0.019$\nDenominator term 1 (True Positives): $0.95 \\times 0.02 = 0.019$\nDenominator term 2 (False Positives): $0.01 \\times 0.98 = 0.0098$\n\nSumming the terms in the denominator:\n$P(T^{+}) = 0.019 + 0.0098 = 0.0288$\n\nNow, we compute the final ratio:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.019}{0.0288} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} \\approx 0.6597222... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
