The following facts are established:\n\n- On March $1$, company pharmacovigilance receives an initial telephone message that mentions a hospitalized case of anaphylaxis temporally associated with the company’s product. The message contains a suspect product and an adverse event but lacks both an identifiable patient and an identifiable reporter (the caller did not leave a name or callback information), so the report does not meet the minimum criteria for a valid Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR).\n- On March $5$, the same caller re-contacts the company and provides name and contact information, and the patient’s initials and date of birth. From this date, the four minimum elements for a valid ICSR are present: an identifiable patient, an identifiable reporter, a suspect product, and an adverse event.\n- On March $10$, the reporter provides laboratory values and lot number; no new seriousness criteria are added or removed.\n- There are weekends and a federal holiday within March, but the regulation specifies calendar days.\n\nUse as fundamental bases the following widely accepted definitions and rules: (i) only valid ICSRs are reportable; (ii) a valid ICSR requires the four minimum elements noted above; (iii) for a serious and unexpected adverse drug experience, the applicant must submit a $15$-calendar-day report to the FDA “as soon as possible but in no case later than” $15$ calendar days from the applicant’s initial receipt of information that makes the case valid; and (iv) “calendar days” include weekends and holidays.

It is a well-posed question grounded in the established regulatory framework of clinical pharmacology, specifically the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for postmarketing adverse event reporting found in Title $21$ of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). The problem provides a clear, self-contained set of facts and definitions, allowing for a unique and logical solution.\n\nThe central task is to determine the latest compliant submission deadline for a $15$-calendar-day alert report. The solution hinges on correctly identifying the \"clock start date,\" which is the date that triggers the beginning of the $15$-day reporting period.\n\nAccording to the provided rules, the reporting clock does not start until a case is considered a \"valid\" Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR). Rule (ii) explicitly defines a valid ICSR as one containing four minimum elements: 1) an identifiable patient, 2) an identifiable reporter, 3) a suspect product, and 4) an adverse event. Furthermore, rule (iii) states that the reporting period begins upon the \"initial receipt of information that makes the case valid.\"\n\nWe must analyze the provided timeline in the context of these rules:\n\n1.  **March $1$**: The company receives an initial message. This message contains information about a suspect product and an adverse event (anaphylaxis). However, it critically lacks an identifiable patient and an identifiable reporter. Therefore, on this date, only two of the four required minimum criteria are met. The ICSR is not yet valid. Consequently, the regulatory clock does not start on March $1$.\n\n2.  **March $5$**: The same reporter re-contacts the company and provides the previously missing information: an identifiable patient (initials and date of birth) and an identifiable reporter (name and contact information). As of this date, all four minimum elements for a valid ICSR are now present. The problem statement confirms this: \"From this date, the four minimum elements for a valid ICSR are present.\" In accordance with rule (iii), this date, March $5$, marks the company’s initial receipt of the complete information required to make the case valid. This is the official \"clock start date\" for the $15$-day reporting period.\n\n3.  **March $10$**: Additional information (laboratory values, lot number) is received. This is considered follow-up information to an already valid case. It does not alter the date on which the case first became valid. The reporting clock, having already started on March $5$, is not reset or affected by the receipt of this follow-up data.\n\nThe regulatory reporting period is specified as $15$ calendar days. Rule (iv) clarifies that \"calendar days\" include all days of the week, including weekends and holidays, so we simply add $15$ days to the start date.\n\nThe clock start date is March $5$. The deadline is $15$ calendar days from this date. The calculation for the deadline day-of-month is a direct addition:\n\n$$\n\\text{Start Day of Month} + \\text{Reporting Period} = \\text{Deadline Day of Month}\n$$\n$$\n5 + 15 = 20\n$$\n\nTherefore, the latest compliant reporting deadline is the end of the day on March $20$.
