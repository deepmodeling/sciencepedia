The provided laboratory values are clinically plausible for a DILI case. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data for the requested calculations and logical deductions. The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe primary task is to compute the R ratio and then use it, along with the bilirubin data, to assess whether Hy's Law criteria are met.\n\nFirst, the R ratio is defined to classify the biochemical pattern of liver injury. The formula is:\n$$R = \\frac{(\\text{ALT}_{\\text{measured}} / \\text{ALT}_{\\text{ULN}})}{(\\text{ALP}_{\\text{measured}} / \\text{ALP}_{\\text{ULN}})}$$\nwhere $\\text{ALT}_{\\text{measured}}$ and $\\text{ALP}_{\\text{measured}}$ are the patient's measured lab values, and $\\text{ALT}_{\\text{ULN}}$ and $\\text{ALP}_{\\text{ULN}}$ are the laboratory's upper limits of normal for those enzymes.\n\nLet's compute the fold increase over the ULN for both ALT and ALP.\nThe fold increase for ALT is:\n$$\\frac{\\text{ALT}_{\\text{measured}}}{\\text{ALT}_{\\text{ULN}}} = \\frac{480}{40} = 12$$\nThe fold increase for ALP is:\n$$\\frac{\\text{ALP}_{\\text{measured}}}{\\text{ALP}_{\\text{ULN}}} = \\frac{150}{120} = 1.25$$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the R ratio formula:\n$$R = \\frac{12}{1.25} = 9.6$$\n\nThe standard interpretation of the R ratio is as follows:\n- $R \\ge 5$: Hepatocellular injury pattern\n- $R \\le 2$: Cholestatic injury pattern\n- $2  R  5$: Mixed injury pattern\n\nSince our calculated $R$ value is $9.6$, which is greater than $5$, the pattern of liver injury is classified as hepatocellular.\n\nNext, we evaluate the criteria for Hy's Law. Hy's Law is a prognostic rule indicating a high risk of fatal DILI. The criteria are:\n1.  Evidence of hepatocellular injury. As established, the R ratio of $9.6$ indicates a hepatocellular pattern. This criterion is met.\n2.  Jaundice, defined as a total bilirubin level of at least $2$ times its ULN. We must check this condition.\n    - Given total bilirubin level: $3.0$ mg/dL\n    - Given ULN for total bilirubin: $1.2$ mg/dL\n    - Required threshold: $2 \\times \\text{ULN} = 2 \\times 1.2 \\text{ mg/dL} = 2.4 \\text{ mg/dL}$.\n    The measured total bilirubin of $3.0$ mg/dL is greater than the threshold of $2.4$ mg/dL. This criterion is also met.\n3.  Absence of alternative causes for the liver injury and hyperbilirubinemia. The problem statement explicitly provides that there is \"no clinical or imaging evidence of biliary obstruction,\" which is a common alternative cause of cholestasis and jaundice. It also excludes hemolysis and inherited bilirubin disorders. This third condition is met by the problem's constraints.\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied—hepatocellular injury pattern (from R ratio), significant hyperbilirubinemia ($\\ge 2 \\times$ ULN), and exclusion of alternative causes—the criteria for Hy's Law would be met in this case.\n\nThe problem asks for the numeric value of the computed R ratio, rounded to three significant figures, as the final answer for grading.\nThe calculated R ratio is $9.6$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $9.60$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.60}$$", "id": "4551280"}, {"introduction": "Once a pattern of liver injury consistent with DILI is identified, the next crucial question is causality: is the drug truly responsible?

This exercise delves into a common mechanism of cholestatic liver injury: the inhibition of the Bile Salt Export Pump (BSEP), a critical transporter on the hepatocyte canalicular membrane [@problem_id:4551300].

Consider a small-molecule inhibitor that binds reversibly and non-cooperatively to a single binding site on BSEP, such that binding of one inhibitor molecule fully prevents transport through that BSEP molecule. Assume the intracellular inhibitor is at equilibrium and that the intracellular unbound inhibitor concentration equals the total intracellular inhibitor concentration, consistent with rapid equilibration and negligible nonspecific binding. Using the law of mass action for reversible binding and the definition of half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC$_{50}$) for a non-cooperative interaction at low substrate concentrations, derive from first principles the steady-state fractional inhibition of BSEP as the fraction of transporter molecules occupied by inhibitor, and then evaluate it for $IC_{50} = 5$ microM and hepatic intracellular inhibitor concentration $C = 10$ microM.

The derivation will be based on first principles, specifically the law of mass action for reversible binding.\n\nLet $T$ represent the unbound BSEP transporter, $I$ represent the unbound intracellular inhibitor, and $TI$ represent the inactive BSEP-inhibitor complex. The binding is described as reversible and non-cooperative, involving a single binding site. The reaction is:\n$$ T + I \\rightleftharpoons TI $$\nAt equilibrium, the law of mass action gives the dissociation constant, $K_d$, as the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the reactants to the concentration of the product complex:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[T][I]}{[TI]} $$\nwhere $[T]$, $[I]$, and $[TI]$ are the molar concentrations of the unbound transporter, unbound inhibitor, and the transporter-inhibitor complex, respectively.\n\nThe problem defines fractional inhibition, which we denote as $f_i$, as the fraction of transporter molecules occupied by the inhibitor.
