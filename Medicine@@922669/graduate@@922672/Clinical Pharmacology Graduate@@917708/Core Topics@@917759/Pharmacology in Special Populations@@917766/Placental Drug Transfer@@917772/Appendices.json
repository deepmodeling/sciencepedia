Assume the following idealized conditions for passive placental transfer: only the unionized (neutral) species crosses the placenta rapidly, there is no active transport, protein binding is negligible, and distribution is fast enough that at passive equilibrium the concentration of the unionized species is equal in maternal and fetal plasma. The maternal plasma has a pH of $7.4$, the fetal plasma has a pH of $7.3$, and the drug’s acid dissociation constant ($pK_a$) is $4.80$. \n\nStarting from fundamental acid-base equilibrium definitions and conservation principles, first determine the unionized fraction of the weak acid in maternal plasma and in fetal plasma.

In an aqueous solution, it undergoes dissociation according to the following equilibrium:\n$$HA \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^-$$\nHere, $HA$ is the unionized (neutral, lipid-soluble) species, and $A^-$ is the ionized (anionic, water-soluble) species.\n\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, for this reaction is defined by the mass-action expression:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}$$\nwhere the brackets denote molar concentrations. It is conventional to work with the negative base-$10$ logarithm of these quantities, defining $pH = -\\log_{10}([H^+])$ and $pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$.

The unionized fraction is defined as the ratio of the unionized concentration to the total concentration:\n$$f_u = \\frac{[HA]}{C_T} = \\frac{[HA]}{[HA] + [A^-]}$$\nTo express $f_u$ in terms of $pH$ and $pK_a$, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by $[HA]$:\n$$f_u = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for the concentration ratio gives the general formula for the unionized fraction of a weak acid:\n$$f_u = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_a}}$$\nUsing the provided data, we can write the expressions for the unionized fractions in the maternal ($m$) and fetal ($f$) plasma.\nGiven: maternal $pH_m = 7.4$, fetal $pH_f = 7.3$, and drug $pK_a = 4.80$.\nThe unionized fraction in maternal plasma, $f_{u,m}$, is:\n$$f_{u,m} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH_m - pK_a}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{7.4 - 4.80}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{2.6}}$$\nThe unionized fraction in fetal plasma, $f_{u,f}$, is:\n$$f_{u,f} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH_f - pK_a}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{7.3 - 4.80}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{2.5}}$$\n\nThe problem is based on the principle of passive diffusion, where it is assumed that only the unionized, lipophilic form of the drug ($HA$) can cross the placental barrier. At equilibrium, the concentration of this permeable species is equal on both sides of the membrane:\n$$[HA]_m = [HA]_f$$\nThe concentration of the unionized species in each compartment can be related to the total drug concentration in that compartment ($C_{T,m}$ and $C_{T,f}$) using the unionized fraction:\n$$[HA]_m = C_{T,m} \\cdot f_{u,m}$$\n$$[HA]_f = C_{T,f} \\cdot f_{u,f}$$\nBy substituting these into the equilibrium condition, we obtain:\n$$C_{T,m} \\cdot f_{u,m} = C_{T,f} \\cdot f_{u,f}$$\nWe are asked to derive the fetal-to-maternal total concentration ratio, $\\frac{C_{T,f}}{C_{T,m}}$. Rearranging the above equation gives:\n$$\\frac{C_{T,f}}{C_{T,m}} = \\frac{f_{u,m}}{f_{u,f}}$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $f_{u,m}$ and $f_{u,f}$ derived previously:\n$$\\frac{C_{T,f}}{C_{T,m}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH_m - pK_a}}}{\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH_f - pK_a}}}$$\nThis simplifies to the final derived relationship:\n$$\\frac{C_{T,f}}{C_{T,m}} = \\frac{1 + 10^{pH_f - pK_a}}{1 + 10^{pH_m - pK_a}}$$\nThis equation demonstrates the principle of \"ion trapping\": a weak acid will have a higher total concentration in the compartment with the higher $pH$ (more basic), because a greater fraction of it will be trapped in its ionized, membrane-impermeable form.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of this ratio using the given values:\n$$\\frac{C_{T,f}}{C_{T,m}} = \\frac{1 + 10^{7.3 - 4.80}}{1 + 10^{7.4 - 4.80}} = \\frac{1 + 10^{2.5}}{1 + 10^{2.6}}$$\nWe calculate the powers of $10$:\n$$10^{2.5} \\approx 316.227766$$\n$$10^{2.6} \\approx 398.107170$$\nSubstituting these values into the ratio expression:\n$$\\frac{C_{T,f}}{C_{T,m}} = \\frac{1 + 316.227766}{1 + 398.107170} = \\frac{317.227766}{399.107170} \\approx 0.7948418$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$0.7948$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7948}$$", "id": "4580454"}, {"introduction": "While understanding the equilibrium state is vital, it is equally important to grasp the kinetics of drug transfer—that is, how quickly this equilibrium is reached.
