The elimination rate constant, $k$, is defined as the ratio of clearance ($Cl$) to the apparent volume of distribution ($V_d$):\n$$ k = \\frac{Cl}{V_d} $$\n\nAt steady state, the average drug concentration, $C_{ss,avg}$, is determined by the mass balance equation, where the rate of drug administration equals the rate of drug elimination.

Therefore, based on this widely used clinical heuristic, the drug exposure to the infant appears to be acceptable.

The actual systemic exposure in the infant is likely even lower.
