The provided data are consistent and sufficient for a solution. The scenario is a standard application of pharmacokinetic principles.\n\nThe core principle for determining the loading dose in a one-compartment model following an intravenous (IV) bolus administration is the mass-balance relationship. This relationship states that the initial concentration in the plasma, $C_0$, which is the concentration achieved immediately after the drug has distributed throughout its volume of distribution, is equal to the administered dose, $D$, divided by the volume of distribution, $V_d$. This is expressed by the equation:\n$$ C_0 = \\frac{D}{V_d} $$\nThe objective is to find the loading dose, $D$, that achieves a specific therapeutic target concentration at the end of the distribution phase, denoted as $C_{\\text{target}}$. We therefore set $C_0 = C_{\\text{target}}$ and rearrange the equation to solve for $D$:\n$$ D = C_{\\text{target}} \\times V_d $$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n-   Target concentration, $C_{\\text{target}} = 20\\,\\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$.\n-   Patient's Total Body Weight, $\\text{TBW} = 160\\,\\text{kg}$.\n-   Volume of distribution per kilogram of body weight, which we will denote as $v_d = 0.9\\,\\text{L}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the total volume of distribution, $V_d$, for this patient. The problem states that for this lipophilic drug, $V_d$ scales with TBW. Thus, $V_d$ is the product of the volume of distribution per kilogram and the patient's total body weight:\n$$ V_d = v_d \\times \\text{TBW} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ V_d = 0.9\\,\\text{L}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1} \\times 160\\,\\text{kg} = 144\\,\\text{L} $$\nNow, with the calculated $V_d$, we can determine the required loading dose, $D$:\n$$ D = C_{\\text{target}} \\times V_d $$\nSubstituting the values for $C_{\\text{target}}$ and $V_d$:\n$$ D = 20\\,\\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1} \\times 144\\,\\text{L} = 2880\\,\\text{mg} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in grams and rounded to four significant figures. To convert milligrams to grams, we divide by $1000$:\n$$ D = \\frac{2880\\,\\text{mg}}{1000\\,\\text{mg}\\,\\text{g}^{-1}} = 2.880\\,\\text{g} $$\nThis value is already expressed with four significant figures.\n\nNext, we must provide a qualitative justification regarding the necessity of the institutional dose cap, $D_{\\text{cap}} = 3.0\\,\\text{g}$.\nThe calculated uncapped loading dose required to achieve the therapeutic target is $D = 2.880\\,\\text{g}$. This dose is less than the institutional cap ($2.880\\,\\text{g} < 3.0\\,\\text{g}$). Therefore, the dose cap policy would not be invoked to limit the dose administered to this patient, as the therapeutically-indicated dose is already below the cap.\n\nTo further analyze the safety margin, we can assess the concentration that would be achieved if the maximum allowed dose, $D_{\\text{cap}}$, were administered. Using $D_{\\text{cap}} = 3.0\\,\\text{g} = 3000\\,\\text{mg}$ and the patient's $V_d = 144\\,\\text{L}$:\n$$ C_{0, \\text{cap}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{cap}}}{V_d} = \\frac{3000\\,\\text{mg}}{144\\,\\text{L}} \\approx 20.83\\,\\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1} $$\nThis resulting concentration, approximately $20.83\\,\\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$, is well below the stated toxicity threshold concentration of $C_{\\text{tox-thresh}} = 30\\,\\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$. Since the dose required to reach the target ($2.880\\,\\text{g}$) results in a concentration of exactly $20\\,\\text{mg}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$, and even the maximum capped dose ($3.0\\,\\text{g}$) results in a concentration far from the toxic threshold, we can conclude that for this specific patient and drug combination, there is a wide margin of safety. While a dose cap is a prudent institutional policy to prevent accidental gross overdoses, in this particular clinical scenario, the calculated dose does not pose a risk of exceeding the cap or the toxicity threshold.
