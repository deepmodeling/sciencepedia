The concepts of clearance ($Cl_{tot}$, $Cl_r$, $Cl_{nr}$), fraction excreted unchanged ($f_e$), and average steady-state concentration ($C_{ss,avg}$) are cornerstones of clinical pharmacology.

The assumptions are clearly stated and reasonable within the context of pharmacokinetic modeling.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe average concentration at steady-state ($C_{ss,avg}$) for a drug administered via a repeating maintenance dose ($Dose$) over a dosing interval ($\\tau$) is given by the mass balance equation:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{\\text{Rate of Drug Administration}}{\\text{Rate of Drug Elimination}} = \\frac{F \\cdot Dose / \\tau}{Cl_{tot}}$$\nwhere $F$ is the bioavailability and $Cl_{tot}$ is the total clearance. This can be written as:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\cdot Dose}{\\tau \\cdot Cl_{tot}}$$\n\nThe therapeutic objective is to maintain the same average steady-state concentration in the setting of renal impairment as at baseline. We denote baseline quantities with the subscript '$b$' and quantities in the impaired state with the subscript '$i$'. Therefore, the objective is $C_{ss,avg,i} = C_{ss,avg,b}$.\n\nUsing the formula for $C_{ss,avg}$:\n$$\\frac{F_i \\cdot Dose_i}{\\tau_i \\cdot Cl_{tot,i}} = \\frac{F_b \\cdot Dose_b}{\\tau_b \\cdot Cl_{tot,b}}$$\n\nThe problem states that the formulation (implying bioavailability) and the dosing interval are unchanged. Thus, $F_i = F_b$ and $\\tau_i = \\tau_b$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{Dose_i}{Cl_{tot,i}} = \\frac{Dose_b}{Cl_{tot,b}}$$\n\nWe seek the dose adjustment factor, which is the ratio of the new dose to the baseline dose, $\\frac{Dose_i}{Dose_b}$. Rearranging the simplified equation yields:\n$$\\frac{Dose_i}{Dose_b} = \\frac{Cl_{tot,i}}{Cl_{tot,b}}$$\n\nNow, we must express the total clearance in both the baseline and impaired states using the given information. At baseline, the total clearance is $Cl_{tot,b} = Cl_{r,b} + Cl_{nr,b}$. We are given that the fraction of drug eliminated renally at baseline is $f_{e,b} = 0.7$. By definition:\n$$f_{e,b} = \\frac{Cl_{r,b}}{Cl_{tot,b}} = 0.7$$\nFrom this, we can express the baseline renal clearance in terms of the baseline total clearance:\n$$Cl_{r,b} = 0.7 \\cdot Cl_{tot,b}$$\nThe remaining fraction of clearance must be nonrenal:\n$$Cl_{nr,b} = Cl_{tot,b} - Cl_{r,b} = Cl_{tot,b} - 0.7 \\cdot Cl_{tot,b} = (1 - 0.7) \\cdot Cl_{tot,b} = 0.3 \\cdot Cl_{tot,b}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the conditions in the state of renal impairment. The patient's $GFR$ decreases by a factor of $0.5$, so $GFR_i = 0.5 \\cdot GFR_b$.\nThe problem assumes that renal clearance, $Cl_r$, is directly proportional to $GFR$. This implies that the ratio of renal clearances is equal to the ratio of GFRs:\n$$\\frac{Cl_{r,i}}{Cl_{r,b}} = \\frac{GFR_i}{GFR_b} = 0.5$$\nTherefore, the renal clearance in the impaired state is:\n$$Cl_{r,i} = 0.5 \\cdot Cl_{r,b}$$\nThe problem also assumes that nonrenal clearance, $Cl_{nr}$, remains unchanged:\n$$Cl_{nr,i} = Cl_{nr,b}$$\n\nNow we can compute the total clearance in the impaired state, $Cl_{tot,i}$:\n$$Cl_{tot,i} = Cl_{r,i} + Cl_{nr,i}$$\nSubstituting the relationships we derived:\n$$Cl_{tot,i} = (0.5 \\cdot Cl_{r,b}) + Cl_{nr,b}$$\nTo find the ratio $\\frac{Cl_{tot,i}}{Cl_{tot,b}}$, we express $Cl_{r,b}$ and $Cl_{nr,b}$ in terms of $Cl_{tot,b}$:\n$$Cl_{tot,i} = 0.5 \\cdot (0.7 \\cdot Cl_{tot,b}) + (0.3 \\cdot Cl_{tot,b})$$\n$$Cl_{tot,i} = (0.35 \\cdot Cl_{tot,b}) + (0.3 \\cdot Cl_{tot,b})$$\n$$Cl_{tot,i} = (0.35 + 0.3) \\cdot Cl_{tot,b} = 0.65 \\cdot Cl_{tot,b}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the dose adjustment factor:\n$$\\frac{Dose_i}{Dose_b} = \\frac{Cl_{tot,i}}{Cl_{tot,b}} = \\frac{0.65 \\cdot Cl_{tot,b}}{Cl_{tot,b}} = 0.65$$\n\nThe maintenance dose should be multiplied by a factor of $0.65$.

Over a single dosing interval, $\\tau$, this implies that the total amount of bioavailable drug administered must equal the total amount of drug eliminated.\n\nThe amount of drug that becomes systemically available from a given dose is the product of the dose and the bioavailability factor, $F$.
