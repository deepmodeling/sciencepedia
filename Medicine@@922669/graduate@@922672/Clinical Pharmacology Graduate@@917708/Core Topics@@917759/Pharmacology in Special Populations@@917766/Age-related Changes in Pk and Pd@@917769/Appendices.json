The analysis begins from the fundamental principles of pharmacokinetics for a drug administered via constant-rate intravenous infusion.\n\nAt steady state ($ss$), the rate of drug administration is precisely balanced by the rate of drug elimination. The rate of administration is given as a constant dosing rate, $R_{0}$. The rate of elimination for a drug exhibiting linear pharmacokinetics is the product of its total clearance ($CL$) and its plasma concentration ($C$). At steady state, the concentration is constant and denoted as $C_{ss}$.\n\nTherefore, the steady-state condition is mathematically described by the equation:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Administration} = \\text{Rate of Elimination}\n$$\n$$\nR_{0} = CL \\times C_{ss}\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the steady-state concentration, $C_{ss}$:\n$$\nC_{ss} = \\frac{R_{0}}{CL}\n$$\nThe problem states that the drug's elimination is exclusively renal. This means that the total clearance, $CL$, is equal to the renal clearance, $CL_{r}$. Thus, the equation becomes:\n$$\nC_{ss} = \\frac{R_{0}}{CL_{r}}\n$$\nThis relationship shows that for a constant dosing rate $R_{0}$, the steady-state plasma concentration is inversely proportional to the renal clearance.\n\nWe are asked to compare two states: an \"old\" state with a higher renal clearance and a \"new\" state, corresponding to an older patient with a reduced renal clearance. Let us denote the variables in these two states with the subscripts \"old\" and \"new\", respectively.\n\nFor the old state, the steady-state concentration is:\n$$\nC_{ss, \\text{old}} = \\frac{R_{0}}{CL_{r, \\text{old}}}\n$$\nFor the new state, the steady-state concentration is:\n$$\nC_{ss, \\text{new}} = \\frac{R_{0}}{CL_{r, \\text{new}}}\n$$\nIt is explicitly stated that the dosing rate, $R_{0}$, remains unchanged between the two states. The other parameters, such as volume of distribution and protein binding, are also constant, which ensures the linear pharmacokinetic model and the clearance concept remain valid and unchanged in their form.\n\nThe problem asks for the fold-change in the steady-state concentration, which is defined as the ratio $\\frac{C_{ss, \\text{new}}}{C_{ss, \\text{old}}}$. We can construct this ratio using the expressions derived above:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{ss, \\text{new}}}{C_{ss, \\text{old}}} = \\frac{\\frac{R_{0}}{CL_{r, \\text{new}}}}{\\frac{R_{0}}{CL_{r, \\text{old}}}}\n$$\nThe constant dosing rate $R_{0}$ cancels out from the numerator and the denominator, simplifying the expression to a ratio of the clearances:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{ss, \\text{new}}}{C_{ss, \\text{old}}} = \\frac{CL_{r, \\text{old}}}{CL_{r, \\text{new}}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the numerical values for the clearances:\n- Old renal clearance, $CL_{r, \\text{old}} = 60\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$\n- New renal clearance, $CL_{r, \\text{new}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the simplified ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{ss, \\text{new}}}{C_{ss, \\text{old}}} = \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}}{30\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}}\n$$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{mL/min}$ cancel, yielding a dimensionless ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{ss, \\text{new}}}{C_{ss, \\text{old}}} = 2\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a unitless ratio rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the value $2$ must be written as $2.000$.
