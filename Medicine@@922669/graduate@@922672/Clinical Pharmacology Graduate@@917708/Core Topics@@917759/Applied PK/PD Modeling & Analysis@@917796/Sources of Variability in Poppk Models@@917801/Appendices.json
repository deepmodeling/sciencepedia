Substituting this into equation (1):\n$f_{1}^{2}X_1 - f_{2}^{2}X_1 = 0 \\implies (f_{1}^{2} - f_{2}^{2})X_1 = 0$.\nGiven that $f_1 = 8$ and $f_2 = 20$, $f_1^2 \\neq f_2^2$, so $f_1^2 - f_2^2 \\neq 0$.

The estimated IIV, $\\omega^\\star$, will be greater than the true IIV, $\\omega_{\\text{true}}$, if $\\sigma_{p}^{2} > 0$. Since $\\sigma_{p}^{2}$ is a variance, it is always non-negative. Therefore, any non-zero proportional residual error ($\\sigma_p^2 > 0$) in the true data-generating process will lead to an overestimation of the IIV variance when an additive residual error model is misspecified.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of pharmacokinetics and statistical modeling, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient information, and uses objective, unambiguous language. The tasks are standard exercises in the application of statistical theory to pharmacometric models. We will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Critical Assessment of the Box-Cox Transformation\n\nThe use of the Box-Cox transformation is a statistically sound and appropriate method to address asymmetry in the residuals of a random-effects model for several reasons, which we will assess from first principles.\n\n1.  **Domain of the Transformation**: The volume of distribution, $V_i$, for an individual $i$, must be a positive quantity, i.e., $V_i > 0$. The typical population value, $V_{\\text{pop}}$, is also a positive volume. Consequently, the dimensionless random-effects scale variable, $u_i = V_i / V_{\\text{pop}}$, is strictly positive, $u_i > 0$. The Box-Cox transformation is defined for positive variables, so this fundamental prerequisite is met.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity and Invertibility**: For a transformation to be a valid reparameterization, it must be a one-to-one mapping, which implies it must be strictly monotonic. This ensures that for every value of the transformed variable $z_i$, there is a unique corresponding value of the original variable $u_i$, and vice-versa. We can check the monotonicity by examining the derivative of the transformation, $\\frac{dz_i}{du_i}$.\n\n    The transformation is given by:\n    $$\n    z_i(u_i) =\n    \\begin{cases}\n    \\dfrac{u_i^{\\lambda} - 1}{\\lambda}, & \\lambda \\neq 0, \\\\\n    \\ln(u_i), & \\lambda = 0.\n    \\end{cases}\n    $$\n    For the case $\\lambda \\neq 0$, the derivative is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dz_i}{du_i} = \\frac{d}{du_i} \\left( \\frac{u_i^{\\lambda} - 1}{\\lambda} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\lambda u_i^{\\lambda-1} \\right) = u_i^{\\lambda-1}.\n    $$\n    Since $u_i > 0$, the term $u_i^{\\lambda-1}$ is always positive, regardless of the value of $\\lambda$.\n\n    For the case $\\lambda = 0$, the derivative is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dz_i}{du_i} = \\frac{d}{du_i} \\ln(u_i) = \\frac{1}{u_i}.\n    $$\n    Again, since $u_i > 0$, the derivative $\\frac{1}{u_i}$ is always positive.\n\n    In both cases, the derivative $\\frac{dz_i}{du_i}$ is positive for all $u_i$ in its domain. This proves that the Box-Cox transformation is strictly monotonic increasing for any value of $\\lambda$. This invertibility is essential for correctly transforming the probability density back to the original parameter space.\n\n3.  **Correction of Asymmetry (Skewness)**: The problem states that the residuals for the random effects on $V$ are right-skewed. This implies that the distribution of $u_i$ is also right-skewed. The primary purpose of the Box-Cox transformation is to find a parameter $\\lambda$ that transforms non-normally distributed data into a set of data that more closely follows a normal distribution. A key feature of this process is the reduction of skewness.\n    - If $\\lambda = 1$, the transformation becomes $z_i = u_i - 1$, which is a simple linear shift and does not alter the skewness of the distribution.\n    - If $\\lambda < 1$, the transformation is concave and will compress the right tail of the distribution of $u_i$ relative to the left tail. This is precisely the action needed to correct for right-skewness. Common examples are the square root transform ($\\lambda = 0.5$) and the log transform ($\\lambda = 0$).\n    - If $\\lambda > 1$, the transformation is convex and would exacerbate right-skewness.\n\n    The fact that the observed residuals are right-skewed suggests that a model fit using this transformation would likely yield an estimated $\\lambda < 1$. The standard log-normal assumption for pharmacokinetic parameters ($V_i = V_{\\text{pop}} \\exp(\\eta_i)$ where $\\eta_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\omega^2)$) is a special case of the Box-Cox transformation where $\\lambda = 0$. By allowing $\\lambda$ to be a parameter estimated from the data, the Box-Cox approach provides a more flexible framework than the rigid log-normal assumption, potentially leading to a better characterization of the inter-individual variability and more symmetric residuals on the transformed scale.\n\nIn summary, the Box-Cox transformation is highly appropriate in this PopPK context. It is defined on the correct domain of positive values, it is invertible, and it is specifically designed to correct for the type of asymmetry observed in the data, providing a data-driven generalization of the standard log-normal model.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Jacobian Determinant\n\nThe likelihood for the random effects is constructed based on the assumption that the transformed variables, $\\{z_i\\}_{i=1}^n$, are independent and identically distributed following a Gaussian (normal) distribution. Let the probability density function (PDF) of a single $z_i$ be $p_Z(z_i)$. Due to independence, the joint PDF is $p_{\\mathbf{Z}}(z_1, \\dots, z_n) = \\prod_{i=1}^n p_Z(z_i)$.\n\nTo express this likelihood in terms of the original parameters $\\{V_i\\}_{i=1}^n$, we must use the change-of-variables theorem for probability densities. The PDF for $\\mathbf{V} = (V_1, \\dots, V_n)$ is given by:\n$$\np_{\\mathbf{V}}(V_1, \\dots, V_n) = p_{\\mathbf{Z}}(z_1(V_1), \\dots, z_n(V_n)) \\cdot \\left| J \\right|\n$$\nwhere $J$ is the Jacobian determinant of the transformation from $\\mathbf{V}$ to $\\mathbf{Z}$:\n$$\nJ = \\det\\left(\\frac{\\partial(z_1, \\dots, z_n)}{\\partial(V_1, \\dots, V_n)}\\right).\n$$\nThe term that must be multiplied into the likelihood is $|J|$.\n\nThe transformation for each individual $i$ is $V_i \\to u_i \\to z_i$, where $u_i = V_i / V_{\\text{pop}}$ and $z_i$ is defined by the Box-Cox transformation. Since $z_i$ depends only on $V_i$ (a consequence of the independence of the random effects), the Jacobian matrix is a diagonal matrix:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial(z_1, \\dots, z_n)}{\\partial(V_1, \\dots, V_n)} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{dz_1}{dV_1} & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{dz_2}{dV_2} & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cdots & \\frac{dz_n}{dV_n}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe determinant of a diagonal matrix is the product of its diagonal elements:\n$$\nJ = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{dz_i}{dV_i}.\n$$\nWe compute the derivative $\\frac{dz_i}{dV_i}$ using the chain rule: $\\frac{dz_i}{dV_i} = \\frac{dz_i}{du_i} \\cdot \\frac{du_i}{dV_i}$.\n\nFirst, we find $\\frac{du_i}{dV_i}$:\n$$\nu_i = \\frac{V_i}{V_{\\text{pop}}} \\implies \\frac{du_i}{dV_i} = \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{pop}}}.\n$$\nSecond, we use the derivative $\\frac{dz_i}{du_i}$ derived in Part 1. We showed that $\\frac{dz_i}{du_i} = u_i^{\\lambda-1}$ for $\\lambda \\neq 0$ and $\\frac{dz_i}{du_i} = \\frac{1}{u_i}$ for $\\lambda = 0$. Note that $u_i^{\\lambda-1}$ with $\\lambda=0$ is $u_i^{-1} = \\frac{1}{u_i}$. Thus, the expression $\\frac{dz_i}{du_i} = u_i^{\\lambda-1}$ is general for all $\\lambda$ relevant to the Box-Cox definition.\n\nCombining these results:\n$$\n\\frac{dz_i}{dV_i} = \\frac{dz_i}{du_i} \\cdot \\frac{du_i}{dV_i} = u_i^{\\lambda-1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{pop}}}.\n$$\nSubstituting $u_i = V_i / V_{\\text{pop}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dz_i}{dV_i} = \\left(\\frac{V_i}{V_{\\text{pop}}}\\right)^{\\lambda-1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{pop}}} = \\frac{V_i^{\\lambda-1}}{V_{\\text{pop}}^{\\lambda-1}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{pop}}} = \\frac{V_i^{\\lambda-1}}{V_{\\text{pop}}^{\\lambda}}.\n$$\nNow we compute the determinant $J$:\n$$\nJ = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{dz_i}{dV_i} = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{V_i^{\\lambda-1}}{V_{\\text{pop}}^{\\lambda}} \\right).\n$$\nWe can separate the terms involving $V_i$ and the constant $V_{\\text{pop}}$:\n$$\nJ = \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{n} V_i^{\\lambda-1} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{pop}}^{\\lambda}} \\right).\n$$\nThe second term is a product of $n$ identical constants:\n$$\nJ = \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{n} V_i^{\\lambda-1} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{pop}}^{\\lambda}} \\right)^n = \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{n} V_i^{\\lambda-1} \\right) \\cdot V_{\\text{pop}}^{-n\\lambda}.\n$$\nThis gives the final expression for the Jacobian determinant:\n$$\nJ = V_{\\text{pop}}^{-n\\lambda} \\prod_{i=1}^{n} V_i^{\\lambda-1}.\n$$\nThe likelihood term requires the absolute value, $|J|$. Since $V_i > 0$ and $V_{\\text{pop}} > 0$ for all $i$, any real power of these terms remains positive. Thus, each term $\\frac{dz_i}{dV_i}$ is positive, their product $J$ is positive, and so $|J| = J$.\n\nThe final expression for the Jacobian determinant is therefore $V_{\\text{pop}}^{-n\\lambda} \\prod_{i=1}^{n} V_i^{\\lambda-1}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{V_{\\text{pop}}^{-n\\lambda} \\prod_{i=1}^{n} V_i^{\\lambda-1}}\n$$", "id": "4592488"}]}
