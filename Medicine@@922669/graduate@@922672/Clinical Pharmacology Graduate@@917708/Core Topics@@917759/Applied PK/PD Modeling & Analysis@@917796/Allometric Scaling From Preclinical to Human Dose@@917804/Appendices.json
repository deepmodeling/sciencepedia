The analysis will proceed as requested.\n\n**Solution Derivation and Computation**\nThe objective is to estimate the scaling exponent $b$ from the allometric relationship between whole-body clearance ($CL$) and body weight ($BW$).\n\nFirst, we must establish the relationship between the quantities. The foundational principle of allometric scaling posits that many physiological rates $Y$ scale with body mass $W$ according to a power law:\n$$Y = a W^b$$\nIn this context, the physiological rate is the systemic (whole-body) clearance, $CL$, and the mass is body weight, $BW$. The coefficient $a$ is the allometric coefficient, and $b$ is the allometric exponent. The model is therefore:\n$$CL = a (BW)^b$$\nThis equation is non-linear. To use linear regression, we must transform it into a linear form. The problem specifies using the natural logarithm. Applying the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) to both sides of the equation yields:\n$$\\ln(CL) = \\ln(a (BW)^b)$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln(xy) = \\ln(x) + \\ln(y)$ and $\\ln(x^p) = p \\ln(x)$, we can expand this equation:\n$$\\ln(CL) = \\ln(a) + \\ln((BW)^b)$$\n$$\\ln(CL) = \\ln(a) + b \\ln(BW)$$\nThis equation is now in the standard form of a linear equation, $y = m x + c$, where:\n- The dependent variable is $y = \\ln(CL)$.\n- The independent variable is $x = \\ln(BW)$.\n- The slope of the line is $m = b$, which is the allometric exponent we need to estimate.\n- The y-intercept is $c = \\ln(a)$.\n\nThe provided data are for weight-normalized clearance, $CL_{norm}$, which is defined as whole-body clearance per unit of body weight:\n$$CL_{norm} = \\frac{CL}{BW}$$\nTherefore, for each species $i$, the whole-body clearance $CL_i$ must first be calculated from the given data:\n$$CL_i = CL_{norm, i} \\times BW_i$$\n\nThe data points for the linear regression are $(x_i, y_i) = (\\ln(BW_i), \\ln(CL_i))$. Using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) for a set of $n$ data points, the slope $b$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals is given by the formula:\n$$b = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} = \\frac{n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i y_i) - (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i)}{n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i^2) - (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)^2}$$\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ are the sample means of $x$ and $y$, respectively.\n\n**Computational Steps**\n1.

We may proceed to the solution.\n\n### (ii) Determination of Human Volume of Distribution ($V_{\\mathrm{human}}$)\nThe problem states that the volume of distribution, $V$, scales with body weight, $W$, to the power of $1.0$. This is expressed by the relationship $V \\propto W^{1.0}$, which can be written as $V = c_V W^{1.0}$ for some proportionality constant $c_V$. An equivalent statement is that the volume of distribution per unit body weight, $V_{\\mathrm{kg}} = V/W$, is constant across species.\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{human}}}{W_{\\mathrm{human}}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dog}}}{W_{\\mathrm{dog}}} = V_{\\mathrm{dog,kg}}\n$$\nWe are given $V_{\\mathrm{dog,kg}} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$ and $W_{\\mathrm{human}} = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.

Our derivation showed that the elimination rate constant $k$ scales with body weight as $k \\propto W^{-0.25}$. This implies that smaller animals (like the dog) eliminate the drug faster than larger animals (like the human). The half-life, $t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/k$, is therefore shorter in smaller animals. This difference in elimination rate constitutes a difference in \"physiological time.\" To maintain a comparable pharmacokinetic profile shape (e.g., a similar trough-to-peak concentration ratio or accumulation ratio), the dosing interval $\\tau$ should be scaled in proportion to the half-life. This means $\\tau$ should scale approximately as $W^{0.25}$. Using the same $\\tau$ for both dog and human would lead to significantly more drug accumulation in the human, as the slower elimination would not allow the concentration to fall as much between doses, potentially leading to unexpected toxicity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{13.5}\n$$", "id": "4521810"}, {"introduction": "Allometric scaling, like any model, is built on assumptions that must be critically evaluated.

For example, $D_r$ is a dose in mg/kg and $CL_{r,\\text{norm}}$ is a clearance in L/h/kg. The area under the curve can be calculated as $AUC = \\frac{D_{\\text{norm}}}{CL_{\\text{norm}}}$.\n\n**1. Define the Target Unbound Exposure**\nThe human equivalent dose is designed to match the unbound exposure observed in the rat. Therefore, the target unbound exposure for humans, $AUC_{u,\\text{target}}$, is equal to the unbound exposure in the rat, $AUC_{u,r}$.\n\nThe unbound exposure in the rat is given by:\n$$AUC_{u,\\text{target}} = AUC_{u,r} = f_{u,r} \\times AUC_{\\text{total},r}$$\nUsing the relationship $AUC_{\\text{total},r} = \\frac{D_r}{CL_{r,\\text{norm}}}$, we have:\n$$AUC_{u,\\text{target}} = f_{u,r} \\frac{D_r}{CL_{r,\\text{norm}}}$$\n\n**2. Derive the Erroneously Calculated Human Dose**\nThe human dose, let's call it $D_{h,\\text{err}}$, is calculated to achieve the target unbound exposure, $AUC_{u,\\text{target}}$. However, this calculation is performed under the erroneous assumption that the plasma fraction unbound in humans is the same as in rats, i.e., $f_{u,h,\\text{assumed}} = f_{u,r}$.\n\nThe predicted human unbound exposure for a given human dose $D_{h,\\text{err}}$ is:\n$$AUC_{u,h,\\text{predicted}} = f_{u,h,\\text{assumed}} \\times AUC_{\\text{total},h} = f_{u,r} \\frac{D_{h,\\text{err}}}{CL_{h,\\text{norm}}}$$\nThe dose $D_{h,\\text{err}}$ is determined by setting the predicted exposure equal to the target exposure:\n$$AUC_{u,h,\\text{predicted}} = AUC_{u,\\text{target}}$$\n$$f_{u,r} \\frac{D_{h,\\text{err}}}{CL_{h,\\text{norm}}} = f_{u,r} \\frac{D_r}{CL_{r,\\text{norm}}}$$\nSolving for the dose $D_{h,\\text{err}}$ (in mg/kg), we find:\n$$\\frac{D_{h,\\text{err}}}{CL_{h,\\text{norm}}} = \\frac{D_r}{CL_{r,\\text{norm}}}$$\n$$D_{h,\\text{err}} = D_r \\frac{CL_{h,\\text{norm}}}{CL_{r,\\text{norm}}}$$\nThis equation defines the human dose that is administered. It is adjusted from the rat dose by the ratio of the normalized clearances. It is noteworthy that the allometric scaling laws are implicitly contained within the term $CL_{h,\\text{norm}}$, but we do not need to calculate it explicitly to proceed.\n\n**3. Calculate the Achieved Human Unbound Exposure**\nThe dose $D_{h,\\text{err}}$ is now administered to a human. The *actual* unbound exposure achieved, $AUC_{u,h,\\text{achieved}}$, must be calculated using the *true* human plasma fraction unbound, $f_{u,h}$.\n\nThe achieved total exposure in humans is:\n$$AUC_{\\text{total},h,\\text{achieved}} = \\frac{D_{h,\\text{err}}}{CL_{h,\\text{norm}}}$$\nThe achieved unbound exposure is therefore:\n$$AUC_{u,h,\\text{achieved}} = f_{u,h} \\times AUC_{\\text{total},h,\\text{achieved}} = f_{u,h} \\frac{D_{h,\\text{err}}}{CL_{h,\\text{norm}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $D_{h,\\text{err}}$ from Step 2:\n$$AUC_{u,h,\\text{achieved}} = f_{u,h} \\frac{\\left(D_r \\frac{CL_{h,\\text{norm}}}{CL_{r,\\text{norm}}}\\right)}{CL_{h,\\text{norm}}}$$\nThe term $CL_{h,\\text{norm}}$ cancels out, leaving:\n$$AUC_{u,h,\\text{achieved}} = f_{u,h} \\frac{D_r}{CL_{r,\\text{norm}}}$$\n\n**4. Compute the Multiplicative Bias Ratio**\nThe bias is the ratio of the achieved unbound exposure to the target unbound exposure.\n$$\\text{Bias Ratio} = \\frac{AUC_{u,h,\\text{achieved}}}{AUC_{u,\\text{target}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived in Step 1 and Step 3:\n$$\\text{Bias Ratio} = \\frac{f_{u,h} \\frac{D_r}{CL_{r,\\text{norm}}}}{f_{u,r} \\frac{D_r}{CL_{r,\\text{norm}}}}$$\nThe term $\\frac{D_r}{CL_{r,\\text{norm}}}$ cancels, yielding a simple expression for the bias:\n$$\\text{Bias Ratio} = \\frac{f_{u,h}}{f_{u,r}}$$\nThis elegant result shows that when dosing is designed to match unbound exposure, but an incorrect unbound fraction is assumed, the resulting error in achieved unbound exposure is directly proportional to the ratio of the true unbound fraction to the assumed unbound fraction. All other parameters, including body weights, clearances, and the allometric scaling exponent, cancel out.\n\n**5. Numerical Calculation**\nUsing the given values:\n- True human plasma fraction unbound: $f_{u,h} = 0.40$\n- Rat plasma fraction unbound (used as the assumed human value): $f_{u,r} = 0.10$\n\n$$\\text{Bias Ratio} = \\frac{0.40}{0.10} = 4.0$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\text{Bias Ratio} = 4.00$$\nThis means that due to the erroneous assumption about plasma protein binding, the actually achieved unbound exposure in humans is $4$ times higher than the intended target.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.00}$$", "id": "4521836"}]}
