The problem defines $EC_{50}$ as the concentration where $f_{occ} = 1/2$. Substituting this into the equation gives $1/2 = EC_{50}^{\\gamma} / (K^{\\gamma} + EC_{50}^{\\gamma})$, which simplifies to $K^{\\gamma} = EC_{50}^{\\gamma}$, meaning $K = EC_{50}$. Thus, the fractional occupancy is:\n    $$f_{occ}(C) = \\frac{C^{\\gamma}}{EC_{50}^{\\gamma} + C^{\\gamma}}$$\n\n2.  **Relating Occupancy to Effect:** The observable effect $E(C)$ is the sum of a baseline effect ($E_0$) and an incremental effect proportional to occupancy.\n    $$E(C) = E_0 + k \\cdot f_{occ}(C)$$\n    where $k$ is a proportionality constant.\n\n3.  **Determining the Proportionality Constant:** The problem states that the incremental effect saturates at $E_{\\max}$ as $C \\to \\infty$.
