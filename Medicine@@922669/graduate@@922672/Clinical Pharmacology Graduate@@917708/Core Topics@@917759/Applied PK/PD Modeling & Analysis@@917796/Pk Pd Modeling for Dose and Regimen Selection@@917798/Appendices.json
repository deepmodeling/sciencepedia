A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the average plasma concentration over a dosing interval at steady state, $C_{ss,avg}$, from fundamental principles.\n\nThe starting point is the mathematical definition of a time-averaged function. The average concentration over one dosing interval, $\\tau$, is the total area under the concentration-time curve ($AUC$) over that interval divided by the duration of the interval. At steady state, this is expressed as:\n$$\nC_{ss,avg} = \\frac{AUC_{ss,\\tau}}{\\tau}\n$$\nwhere $AUC_{ss,\\tau}$ is the area under the concentration-time curve from time $t$ to $t+\\tau$ at steady state. Mathematically, if $C(t)$ is the plasma concentration at time $t$, then:\n$$\nAUC_{ss,\\tau} = \\int_{t_{ss}}^{t_{ss}+\\tau} C(t) dt\n$$\nwhere $t_{ss}$ is any time point after steady state has been achieved.\n\nNext, we incorporate the definition of systemic clearance, $CL$. Clearance is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of drug per unit time. It relates the rate of elimination of the drug from the body to its plasma concentration:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of elimination}(t) = CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nThis relationship holds because the problem states the pharmacokinetics are linear.\n\nThe total amount of drug eliminated from the body over one dosing interval at steady state, denoted $Amount_{elim,ss,\\tau}$, can be found by integrating the rate of elimination over the interval $\\tau$:\n$$\nAmount_{elim,ss,\\tau} = \\int_{t_{ss}}^{t_{ss}+\\tau} \\text{Rate of elimination}(t) dt = \\int_{t_{ss}}^{t_{ss}+\\tau} CL \\cdot C(t) dt\n$$\nSince clearance, $CL$, is a constant (due to time-invariant pharmacokinetics), it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\nAmount_{elim,ss,\\tau} = CL \\cdot \\int_{t_{ss}}^{t_{ss}+\\tau} C(t) dt\n$$\nThe integral in this expression is, by definition, $AUC_{ss,\\tau}$. Therefore, we establish a crucial link between the amount eliminated, clearance, and AUC:\n$$\nAmount_{elim,ss,\\tau} = CL \\cdot AUC_{ss,\\tau}\n$$\n\nThe final principle to apply is the definition of steady state. At steady state, the rate of drug administration is equal to the rate of drug elimination when averaged over a dosing interval. This implies that the total amount of drug that enters the systemic circulation during one dosing interval must equal the total amount of drug that is eliminated during that same interval.\n\nThe amount of drug administered is the dose, $D$. The fraction of this dose that reaches the systemic circulation is the bioavailability, $F$. Thus, the amount of drug entering the systemic circulation per dosing interval is the bioavailable dose, $F \\cdot D$.\n$$\n\\text{Amount absorbed systemically per interval} = F \\cdot D\n$$\nAt steady state, this must equal the amount eliminated per interval:\n$$\nAmount_{elim,ss,\\tau} = F \\cdot D\n$$\n\nWe now have two expressions for $Amount_{elim,ss,\\tau}$:\n1.  $Amount_{elim,ss,\\tau} = CL \\cdot AUC_{ss,\\tau}$\n2.  $Amount_{elim,ss,\\tau} = F \\cdot D$\n\nEquating these two expressions gives:\n$$\nCL \\cdot AUC_{ss,\\tau} = F \\cdot D\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for $AUC_{ss,\\tau}$:\n$$\nAUC_{ss,\\tau} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL}\n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this derived expression for $AUC_{ss,\\tau}$ back into our original definition of $C_{ss,avg}$:\n$$\nC_{ss,avg} = \\frac{AUC_{ss,\\tau}}{\\tau} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL}\\right)}{\\tau}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final derived formula for the steady-state average concentration:\n$$\nC_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL \\cdot \\tau}\n$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values into this formula to compute the result.\nGiven:\n- $F = 0.6$ (dimensionless)\n- $D = 200\\,\\text{mg}$\n- $CL = 10\\,\\text{L/h}$\n- $\\tau = 12\\,\\text{h}$\n\n$$\nC_{ss,avg} = \\frac{0.6 \\cdot 200\\,\\text{mg}}{(10\\,\\text{L/h}) \\cdot (12\\,\\text{h})}\n$$\n$$\nC_{ss,avg} = \\frac{120\\,\\text{mg}}{120\\,\\text{L}}\n$$\n$$\nC_{ss,avg} = 1.0\\,\\text{mg/L}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nC_{ss,avg} = 1.000\\,\\text{mg/L}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.000}\n$$", "id": "4576899"}, {"introduction": "Effective drug therapy requires not only understanding a drug's concentration profile but also linking it to a desired clinical effect.

The simulation is based on a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model with immediate extravascular input, first-order elimination, and interindividual variability on clearance.\n\nHerein, we will first derive the necessary equations from first principles and then outline the simulation algorithm.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Steady-State Trough Concentration ($C_{min,ss}$)**\n\nThe model is defined by mass balance within a single compartment. Let $A(t)$ be the amount of drug in the body at time $t$, $V$ be the volume of distribution, and $CL$ be the clearance. The concentration is $C(t) = A(t)/V$. The rate of elimination is defined as $CL \\cdot C(t)$.\n\nThe rate of change of the amount of drug in the body between doses is governed by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = - (\\text{Rate of Elimination}) = -CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nSubstituting $C(t) = A(t)/V$ and defining the first-order elimination rate constant $k = CL/V$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{CL}{V} A(t) = -k A(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. Its solution describes the exponential decay of the drug amount over time:\n$$\nA(t) = A_0 e^{-kt}\n$$\nwhere $A_0$ is the initial amount of drug at time $t=0$. In terms of concentration, this is:\n$$\nC(t) = C_0 e^{-kt}\n$$\nwhere $C_0 = A_0/V$.\n\nThe problem specifies a multiple-dosing regimen where a dose $D$ is administered at a regular interval $\\tau$. The bioavailability $F$ is given as $1$. \"Immediate input\" implies that at the beginning of each dosing interval, the amount of drug in the body instantaneously increases by the dose $D$.\n\nLet $C_{min,ss}$ be the trough concentration at steady state (the concentration just before a dose) and $C_{max,ss}$ be the peak concentration at steady state (the concentration just after a dose).\nJust before a dose at steady state, the concentration is $C_{min,ss}$.\nImmediately after the dose is administered, the concentration increases by $D/V$:\n$$\nC_{max,ss} = C_{min,ss} + \\frac{D \\cdot F}{V} = C_{min,ss} + \\frac{D}{V}\n$$\nOver the dosing interval $\\tau$, this peak concentration decays exponentially. The concentration just before the next dose (which, at steady state, is again $C_{min,ss}$) is:\n$$\nC_{min,ss} = C_{max,ss} \\cdot e^{-k\\tau}\n$$\nWe now have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $C_{min,ss}$ and $C_{max,ss}$. Substituting the first equation into the second:\n$$\nC_{min,ss} = \\left( C_{min,ss} + \\frac{D}{V} \\right) e^{-k\\tau}\n$$\n$$\nC_{min,ss} = C_{min,ss} e^{-k\\tau} + \\frac{D}{V} e^{-k\\tau}\n$$\n$$\nC_{min,ss} (1 - e^{-k\\tau}) = \\frac{D}{V} e^{-k\\tau}\n$$\nSolving for $C_{min,ss}$ yields the formula for the steady-state trough concentration:\n$$\nC_{min,ss} = \\frac{D}{V} \\cdot \\frac{e^{-k\\tau}}{1 - e^{-k\\tau}}\n$$\nThis formula is derived from first principles as required.\n\n**2. Modeling Interindividual Variability (IIV)**\n\nThe problem specifies log-normal variability for clearance ($CL$). For an individual $i$, their clearance $CL_i$ is given by:\n$$\nCL_i = CL_{typ} \\exp(\\eta_i)\n$$\nwhere $CL_{typ}$ is the typical (geometric mean) clearance in the population, and $\\eta_i$ is a random variable drawn from a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $\\omega^2$, i.e., $\\eta_i \\sim N(0, \\omega^2)$.\n\nWe must calibrate the parameter $\\omega$ based on the given coefficient of variation (CV) of clearance on the natural scale, denoted $\\omega_{CL}$. For a log-normally distributed variable $X = \\exp(Y)$ where $Y \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, the squared CV is related to the variance $\\sigma^2$ by:\n$$\nCV^2 = \\frac{\\text{Var}(X)}{(E[X])^2} = \\exp(\\sigma^2) - 1\n$$\nIn our case, $X$ is $CL_i$, $\\ln(CL_i) = \\ln(CL_{typ}) + \\eta_i$, so $\\ln(CL_i)$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu = \\ln(CL_{typ})$ and variance $\\sigma^2 = \\omega^2$. We are given $CV = \\omega_{CL}$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\omega_{CL}^2 = \\exp(\\omega^2) - 1\n$$\nSolving for $\\omega^2$, we get $\\omega^2 = \\ln(\\omega_{CL}^2 + 1)$. The standard deviation $\\omega$ used for generating $\\eta_i$ values is thus:\n$$\n\\omega = \\sqrt{\\ln(\\omega_{CL}^2 + 1)}\n$$\nIf $\\omega_{CL} = 0$, then $\\omega=0$, signifying no variability. The volume of distribution $V$ is fixed at its typical value $V_{typ}$ for all individuals.\n\n**3.

If $\\omega_{CL}=0$, then $\\omega=0$.\n4.  **Generate Cohort**:\n    a. Generate $N$ random variates $\\eta_i$ from the distribution $N(0, \\omega^2)$.\n    b. For each $\\eta_i$, calculate the individual's clearance: $CL_i = CL_{typ} \\exp(\\eta_i)$.\n5.  **Calculate Individual PK**: For each of the $N$ individuals:\n    a.
