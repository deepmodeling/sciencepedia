The rate of change of the drug concentration, $C(t)$, with respect to time, $t$, is directly proportional to the concentration itself. This is expressed by the following linear first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k_e C(t)\n$$\nwhere $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. The negative sign indicates that the concentration decreases over time.\n\nThis differential equation is separable:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{C} = -k_e dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to an arbitrary time $t > 0$. The corresponding concentrations are $C(0)$ and $C(t)$.\n$$\n\\int_{C(0)}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C'} dC' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k_e dt'\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln|C'|]_{C(0)}^{C(t)} = -k_e [t']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C(0)) = -k_e t\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can write:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C(0)}\\right) = -k_e t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the explicit function for concentration over time:\n$$\nC(t) = C(0) \\exp(-k_e t)\n$$\nThe problem states that at $t=0$, the dosing is stopped, and the concentration is at its steady-state average, $C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. Thus, the initial condition is $C(0) = C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. The equation for washout kinetics is:\n$$\nC(t) = C_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\exp(-k_e t)\n$$\nNext, we must relate the elimination rate constant $k_e$ to the given elimination half-life, $t_{1/2}$.

The conversion factor, $k$, from alprazolam dose to diazepam dose is:\n    $$k = \\frac{10 \\, \\text{mg diazepam}}{0.5 \\, \\text{mg alprazolam}} = 20$$\n    The initial daily dose of diazepam, $D_0$, is the equianxiolytic dose corresponding to $4$ mg/day of alprazolam.\n    $$D_0 = D_{alp} \\times k = 4 \\, \\text{mg} \\times 20 = 80 \\, \\text{mg/day}$$\n    This is the dose at the start of the taper, which corresponds to week $n=0$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Geometric Sequence for the Taper**\n    The problem states that the diazepam dose is reduced by a proportion $f = 0.10$ of the current dose each week. Let $D_n$ be the daily dose of diazepam after $n$ full weeks of tapering.\n    The reduction is multiplicative. After each week, the new dose is the old dose multiplied by a factor of $(1 - f)$.\n    $$1 - f = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$$\n    Let $r = 0.90$ be the common ratio of the geometric sequence.\n    The dose after $1$ week is $D_1 = D_0 \\times r$.\n    The dose after $2$ weeks is $D_2 = D_1 \\times r = (D_0 \\times r) \\times r = D_0 \\times r^2$.\n    Following this pattern, the dose after $n$ full weeks is given by the formula for a geometric sequence:\n    $$D_n = D_0 \\times r^n$$\n    Substituting the known values, we have:\n    $$D_n = 80 \\times (0.90)^n$$\n\n3.  **Solve for the Number of Weeks to Reach the Termination Condition**\n    The taper is discontinued when the daily diazepam dose is strictly less than $5$ mg/day.

Since the natural logarithm is a strictly increasing function, the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n    $$\\ln\\left((0.90)^n\\right) < \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right)$$\n    Using the logarithm property $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$:\n    $$n \\ln(0.90) < \\ln(1) - \\ln(16)$$\n    Since $\\ln(1) = 0$:\n    $$n \\ln(0.90) < -\\ln(16)$$\n    To isolate $n$, we must divide by $\\ln(0.90)$. It is critical to note that for any number $x$ where $0 < x < 1$, its natural logarithm $\\ln(x)$ is negative. Thus, $\\ln(0.90)$ is a negative number. When dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality must be reversed.\n    $$n > \\frac{-\\ln(16)}{\\ln(0.90)}$$\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    $$n > \\frac{\\ln(16)}{-\\ln(0.90)} = \\frac{\\ln(16)}{\\ln\\left((0.90)^{-1}\\right)} = \\frac{\\ln(16)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.90}\\right)} = \\frac{\\ln(16)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{10}{9}\\right)}$$\n    Now we evaluate this expression numerically:\n    $$\\ln(16) \\approx 2.7725887...$$\n    $$\\ln(0.90) \\approx -0.1053605...$$\n    $$n > \\frac{-2.7725887...}{-0.1053605...} \\approx 26.315$$\n    So, the inequality is $n > 26.315$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Minimal Integer Number of Weeks**\n    The variable $n$ represents the number of full weeks of tapering that have been completed. Since $n$ must be an integer, we need to find the smallest integer that is strictly greater than $26.315$.\n    The smallest integer $n$ satisfying this condition is $n = 27$.\n    This means that after $26$ weeks, the dose is still $\\ge 5$ mg/day, but after $27$ weeks, the dose will have dropped strictly below $5$ mg/day.\n    Let's verify:\n    Dose after $26$ weeks: $D_{26} = 80 \\times (0.90)^{26} \\approx 80 \\times 0.06460 = 5.168$ mg/day. This is not less than $5$.\n    Dose after $27$ weeks: $D_{27} = 80 \\times (0.90)^{27} \\approx 80 \\times 0.05814 = 4.651$ mg/day. This is strictly less than $5$.\n    The calculation is correct.

This advanced problem delves into the receptor-level pharmacology that explains the safety and efficacy of a microinduction protocol, requiring you to demonstrate why net receptor activation does not fall below baseline. By connecting fundamental receptor theory to the design of an innovative dosing schedule, you will bridge the gap between molecular mechanisms and evidence-based clinical practice [@problem_id:4548041].", "problem": "A patient with opioid dependence is maintained on a stable dose of a full mu-opioid receptor agonist that produces a baseline steady-state net mu-receptor activation fraction of $0.60$ (on a $0$ to $1$ scale, where $1$ corresponds to the maximal effect of a full agonist). You aim to microinduce buprenorphine while continuing the full agonist at the same dose throughout the induction. Assume a single homogeneous receptor population with competitive binding at equilibrium and no receptor reserve. Buprenorphine acts as a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor with intrinsic efficacy $\\varepsilon_{B} = 0.70$ relative to the full agonist, which has intrinsic efficacy $\\varepsilon_{F} = 1.00$.
