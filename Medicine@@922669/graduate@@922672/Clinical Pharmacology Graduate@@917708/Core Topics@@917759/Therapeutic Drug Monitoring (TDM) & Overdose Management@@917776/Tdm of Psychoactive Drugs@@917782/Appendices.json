This first exercise provides hands-on practice in the essential stoichiometric conversion from the mass of a drug salt to the molar amount of the active ion, a critical first step in linking dosage to clinical effect. [@problem_id:4597564]", "problem": "In Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) of lithium, dosing is prescribed as a salt but clinical interpretation relies on the amount of lithium ion delivered.

The molar mass of lithium carbonate is correctly stated ($\\text{Li}$: $6.941$, $\\text{C}$: $12.011$, $\\text{O}$: $15.999$; $2 \\times 6.941 + 12.011 + 3 \\times 15.999 = 13.882 + 12.011 + 47.997 = 73.890$ g/mol). The concepts of mole, millimole, and milliequivalent are standard and correctly invoked. Lithium is indeed a monovalent cation ($\\text{Li}^+$).\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined and provides all necessary data for the calculations. The tasks are specific, and a unique, meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and free of subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts: first, the calculation of the amount of lithium ion in millimoles; second, the calculation of the amount in milliequivalents; and third, the justification for the interchangeability of these units for monovalent ions.\n\nLet $m_{\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3}$ be the mass of the lithium carbonate dose and $M_{\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3}$ be its molar mass. The number of moles of lithium carbonate, $n_{\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3}$, is given by the definition of the mole:\n$$n_{\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3} = \\frac{m_{\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3}}{M_{\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3}}$$\nThe given mass is $m_{\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3} = 300$ mg, which must be converted to grams to be dimensionally consistent with the molar mass unit of g/mol.\n$$m_{\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3} = 300 \\, \\text{mg} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{g}}{1000 \\, \\text{mg}} = 0.300 \\, \\text{g}$$\nUsing the given molar mass $M_{\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3} = 73.89$ g/mol, we calculate the moles of lithium carbonate:\n$$n_{\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3} = \\frac{0.300 \\, \\text{g}}{73.89 \\, \\text{g/mol}} \\approx 0.004060089 \\, \\text{mol}$$\n\nAccording to the problem statement and the chemical formula $\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3$, each mole of lithium carbonate dissociates to yield two moles of lithium ions ($\\text{Li}^+$). The stoichiometric relationship is:\n$$n_{\\text{Li}^+} = 2 \\times n_{\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3}$$\nSubstituting the value for $n_{\\text{Li}_2\\text{CO}_3}$:\n$$n_{\\text{Li}^+} = 2 \\times 0.004060089 \\, \\text{mol} \\approx 0.008120178 \\, \\text{mol}$$\n\nThe amount in millimoles (mmol) is obtained by converting from moles, using the relationship $1$ mol $= 1000$ mmol.\n$$\\text{Amount in mmol} = n_{\\text{Li}^+} \\times 1000 \\, \\frac{\\text{mmol}}{\\text{mol}}$$\n$$\\text{Amount of } \\text{Li}^+ \\text{ in mmol} = 0.008120178 \\, \\text{mol} \\times 1000 \\, \\frac{\\text{mmol}}{\\text{mol}} \\approx 8.120178 \\, \\text{mmol}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the amount of lithium ion is $8.12$ mmol.\n\nNext, we compute the amount in milliequivalents (mEq). The number of equivalents (Eq) of an ion is defined as the product of the number of moles ($n$) and the absolute value of its valence (charge), $|z|$.\n$$\\text{Eq} = n \\times |z|$$\nSimilarly, the number of milliequivalents is the product of the number of millimoles (mmol) and the valence.\n$$\\text{mEq} = \\text{mmol} \\times |z|$$\nFor the lithium ion, $\\text{Li}^+$, the valence is $z = +1$. Therefore, its absolute value is $|z| = 1$.\n$$\\text{Amount of } \\text{Li}^+ \\text{ in mEq} = (\\text{Amount of } \\text{Li}^+ \\text{ in mmol}) \\times |1|$$\n$$\\text{Amount of } \\text{Li}^+ \\text{ in mEq} = 8.120178 \\, \\text{mmol} \\times 1 \\approx 8.120178 \\, \\text{mEq}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the amount of lithium ion is $8.12$ mEq.\n\nFinally, we justify the use of millimoles for monovalent lithium in TDM. As established by the definition of an equivalent, the conversion between millimoles and milliequivalents is mediated by the valence of the ion: $\\text{mEq} = \\text{mmol} \\times |z|$. For monovalent ions, such as lithium ($\\text{Li}^+$), sodium ($\\text{Na}^+$), potassium ($\\text{K}^+$), and chloride ($\\text{Cl}^-$), the valence $z$ is either $+1$ or $-1$. In either case, the absolute value of the valence is $|z|=1$. Consequently, for any monovalent species, the relationship simplifies to:\n$$\\text{mEq} = \\text{mmol} \\times 1 = \\text{mmol}$$\nThis indicates that the numerical value of the amount of a monovalent substance is identical whether expressed in millimoles or milliequivalents. Therefore, in the context of TDM for lithium, reporting the amount or concentration in mmol/L is numerically equivalent to mEq/L. The use of mmol is often preferred for simplicity, as it directly represents the molar quantity without the additional (and in this case, redundant) step of accounting for valence. This direct correspondence breaks down for polyvalent ions (e.g., $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$, $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$, where $|z|=2$, or $\\text{PO}_4^{3-}$, where $|z|=3$), for which the distinction between millimoles and milliequivalents is crucial.\n\nThe final numerical results, rounded to three significant figures, are $8.12$ mmol and $8.12$ mEq.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 8.12 & 8.12 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4597564"}, {"introduction": "A cornerstone of effective TDM is sampling at the right time, specifically, once the drug has reached a stable concentration, or \"steady state.\" Measuring a drug level too early can be misleading, as the concentration is still rising toward its plateau.

We may proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the time course of drug accumulation under a constant-rate input model and the subsequent calculation of the time to reach a specific fraction of the steady-state concentration. We begin from the two specified first principles.\n\nLet $A(t)$ be the amount of lithium in the body at time $t$, and $C(t)$ be its concentration in the single compartment of volume $V_d$. We have the relation $A(t) = V_d C(t)$. The model assumes a constant-rate input, which we denote as $R_0$ (amount per unit time), and first-order elimination.\n\nThe net rate of change of the amount of drug in the body, $\\frac{dA}{dt}$, is the difference between the rate of input and the rate of elimination:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = \\text{Rate in} - \\text{Rate out}\n$$\n\nThe rate of input is constant:\n$$\n\\text{Rate in} = R_0\n$$\n\nThe first starting point is the definition of first-order elimination, which states that the rate of elimination is directly proportional to the amount of drug in the body. The proportionality constant is the elimination rate constant, $k_e$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate out} = k_e A(t)\n$$\n\nSubstituting these rates into the balance equation gives the differential equation for the amount of drug:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = R_0 - k_e A(t)\n$$\n\nTo express this in terms of concentration $C(t)$, we substitute $A(t) = V_d C(t)$.

Our derivation shows that the approach to steady state is an exponential process governed by the elimination half-life. The time to reach a concentration that is clinically indistinguishable from steady state (conventionally taken as >95%) is independent of the dosing rate $R_0$ or the volume of distribution $V_d$, and depends only on the half-life. The calculation indicates that it takes approximately $86.44$ hours, or about $3.6$ days, for this patient to achieve $95\\%$ of the steady-state lithium level. This is approximately $4.32$ half-lives. Therefore, to avoid measuring a transient concentration that is still significantly rising, the first trough blood sample for TDM should be collected only after this minimum period has elapsed from the initiation of therapy.

Lithium is eliminated predominantly by the kidneys, with first-order elimination and negligible metabolism, and it is commonly modeled using linear compartmental pharmacokinetics at the clinical level.
