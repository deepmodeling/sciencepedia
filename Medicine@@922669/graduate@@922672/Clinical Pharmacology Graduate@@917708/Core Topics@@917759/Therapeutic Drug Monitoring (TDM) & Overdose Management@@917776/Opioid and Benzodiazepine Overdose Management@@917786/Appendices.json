First, we identify the primary acid-base disturbance and determine the cause of hypoxemia. Second, we calculate the necessary increase in alveolar ventilation ($V_A$) to normalize the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide ($P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$).\n\n**Part 1: ABG Analysis and Cause of Hypoxemia**\n\nThe patient's ABG results on room air are:\n- pH: $7.23$ (Normal range: $7.35-7.45$)\n- $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$: $68$ mmHg (Normal range: $35-45$ mmHg)\n- $P_{a\\text{O}_2}$: $60$ mmHg (Normal range on room air: $80-100$ mmHg)\n\nThe low pH ($<7.35$) indicates acidemia. The high $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$ ($>45$ mmHg) indicates hypercapnia. The combination of acidemia and hypercapnia confirms a primary **respiratory acidosis**, which is consistent with the clinical picture of hypoventilation from opioid and benzodiazepine overdose.\n\nTo assess whether the hypoxemia is solely due to this hypoventilation, we calculate the alveolar-arterial ($A-a$) oxygen gradient. The gradient is the difference between the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen ($P_{A\\text{O}_2}$) and the arterial partial pressure of oxygen ($P_{a\\text{O}_2}$). $P_{A\\text{O}_2}$ is calculated using the alveolar gas equation:\n$$P_{A\\text{O}_2} = F_{i\\text{O}_2} (P_b - P_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}) - \\frac{P_{a\\text{CO}_2}}{R}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P_{A\\text{O}_2} = 0.21 \\times (760 - 47) \\, \\text{mmHg} - \\frac{68 \\, \\text{mmHg}}{0.8}$$\n$$P_{A\\text{O}_2} = 0.21 \\times (713) \\, \\text{mmHg} - 85 \\, \\text{mmHg}$$\n$$P_{A\\text{O}_2} = 149.73 \\, \\text{mmHg} - 85 \\, \\text{mmHg} = 64.73 \\, \\text{mmHg}$$\nNow, we calculate the $A-a$ gradient:\n$$A\\text{-}a \\text{ gradient} = P_{A\\text{O}_2} - P_{a\\text{O}_2} = 64.73 \\, \\text{mmHg} - 60 \\, \\text{mmHg} = 4.73 \\, \\text{mmHg}$$\nA normal $A-a$ gradient is typically less than $15$ mmHg (and increases with age). Since $4.73$ mmHg is well within the normal range, we conclude that the patient's hypoxemia is fully explained by alveolar hypoventilation.\n\n**Part 2: Required Increase in Alveolar Ventilation**\n\nThe relationship between alveolar ventilation ($V_A$) and arterial $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$ is described by the alveolar ventilation equation, which can be simplified to an inverse proportionality, assuming constant carbon dioxide production ($V_{\\text{CO}_2}$):\n$$P_{a\\text{CO}_2} \\propto \\frac{1}{V_A} \\quad \\implies \\quad P_{a\\text{CO}_2} \\times V_A = \\text{constant}$$\nLet the initial state be subscript 1 (current) and the final state be subscript 2 (target).\n$$P_{a\\text{CO}_{2,1}} \\times V_{A,1} = P_{a\\text{CO}_{2,2}} \\times V_{A,2}$$\nWe need to find the factor by which $V_A$ must increase, which is the ratio $\\frac{V_{A,2}}{V_{A,1}}$.\n$$\\frac{V_{A,2}}{V_{A,1}} = \\frac{P_{a\\text{CO}_{2,1}}}{P_{a\\text{CO}_{2,2}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values (current $P_{a\\text{CO}_2} = 68$ mmHg, target $P_{a\\text{CO}_2} = 40$ mmHg):\n$$\\frac{V_{A,2}}{V_{A,1}} = \\frac{68}{40} = 1.7$$\nTo restore a normal $P_{a\\text{CO}_2}$, alveolar ventilation must increase by a factor of $1.7$.
