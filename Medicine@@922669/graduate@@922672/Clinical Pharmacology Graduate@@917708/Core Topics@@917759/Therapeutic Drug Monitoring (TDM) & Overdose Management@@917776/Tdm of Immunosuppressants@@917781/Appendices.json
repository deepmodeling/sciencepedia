The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## Derivation of Apparent Oral Clearance ($CL/F$)\n\nThe problem is set within a one-compartment model with first-order elimination after multiple oral doses at steady state. The assumption that \"oral absorption is rapid relative to elimination\" ($k_a \\gg k$) allows us to approximate the concentration profile during the elimination phase as if the dose were administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus.\n\nLet $C(t)$ be the drug concentration at time $t$. At steady state, the concentration profile is periodic with period $\\tau$. The trough concentration, $C_0$, is measured just before a dose. Let's model the concentration change over a single dosing interval at steady state.\n\nLet the amount of drug in the body just before a dose be $A_0$. The concentration is $C_0 = A_0/V$, where $V$ is the apparent volume of distribution.\nImmediately after the oral dose is completely absorbed, the amount of drug in the body increases by the bioavailable dose, $F \\cdot \\text{Dose}$. This assumes an instantaneous absorption (impulse input), consistent with the \"rapid absorption\" assumption for the purpose of modeling the concentration decay.\nThe amount of drug immediately post-absorption is $A_{peak} = A_0 + F \\cdot \\text{Dose}$.\nThis amount then declines due to first-order elimination over the dosing interval $\\tau$. The amount remaining just before the next dose is:\n$A_0' = A_{peak} \\cdot e^{-k\\tau} = (A_0 + F \\cdot \\text{Dose}) \\cdot e^{-k\\tau}$\n\nAt steady state, the amount just before a dose is the same for every cycle, so $A_0' = A_0$.\n$A_0 = (A_0 + F \\cdot \\text{Dose}) \\cdot e^{-k\\tau}$\n$A_0 = A_0 \\cdot e^{-k\\tau} + (F \\cdot \\text{Dose}) \\cdot e^{-k\\tau}$\n$A_0(1 - e^{-k\\tau}) = (F \\cdot \\text{Dose}) \\cdot e^{-k\\tau}$\n$A_0 = \\dfrac{(F \\cdot \\text{Dose}) \\cdot e^{-k\\tau}}{1 - e^{-k\\tau}}$\n\nWe can divide by the volume of distribution $V$ to get concentrations, where $C_0 = A_0/V$.\n$C_0 = \\dfrac{(F \\cdot \\text{Dose}/V) \\cdot e^{-k\\tau}}{1 - e^{-k\\tau}}$\n\nThis expression can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $e^{k\\tau}$:\n$C_0 = \\dfrac{F \\cdot \\text{Dose}/V}{e^{k\\tau} - 1}$\n\nFor a one-compartment model, the clearance ($CL$), volume of distribution ($V$), and elimination rate constant ($k$) are related by the fundamental definition $CL = k \\cdot V$. Therefore, we can substitute $V = CL/k$.\n$C_0 = \\dfrac{F \\cdot \\text{Dose}}{(CL/k)(e^{k\\tau} - 1)} = \\dfrac{F \\cdot \\text{Dose} \\cdot k}{CL(e^{k\\tau} - 1)}$\n\nThe problem asks for an expression for the apparent oral clearance, $CL/F$. We rearrange the equation to solve for this group of terms:\n$C_0 \\cdot CL \\cdot (e^{k\\tau} - 1) = F \\cdot \\text{Dose} \\cdot k$\n$\\dfrac{CL}{F} = \\dfrac{\\text{Dose} \\cdot k}{C_0(e^{k\\tau} - 1)}$\n\nThis is the derived expression. We can only identify the ratio $CL/F$ because the absolute bioavailability, $F$, is an unknown multiplier affecting the amount of drug that reaches the systemic circulation from the oral dose. Without data from an IV administration (where $F=1$), $CL$ and $F$ cannot be deconvoluted.\n\n## Numerical Calculation\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- $\\text{Dose} = 3\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n- $\\tau = 12\\,\\mathrm{h}$\n- $t_{1/2} = 16\\,\\mathrm{h}$\n- $C_0 = 8\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL} = 0.008\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the elimination rate constant $k$:\n$k = \\dfrac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} = \\dfrac{\\ln(2)}{16\\,\\mathrm{h}} \\approx 0.0433147\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$\n\nNext, we calculate the dimensionless term $k\\tau$:\n$k\\tau = \\left(\\dfrac{\\ln 2}{16}\\right) \\cdot 12 = \\dfrac{3 \\ln 2}{4} \\approx 0.5197766$\n\nNow, we evaluate the term in the denominator, $(e^{k\\tau}-1)$:\n$e^{k\\tau} - 1 = e^{3 \\ln(2) / 4} - 1 = (2^{3/4}) - 1 = \\sqrt[4]{8} - 1 \\approx 1.681793 - 1 = 0.681793$\n\nFinally, we substitute all values into the derived expression for $CL/F$:\n$CL/F = \\dfrac{3\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\ln 2}{16}\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}\\right)}{0.008\\,\\mathrm{mg/L} \\cdot \\left(e^{\\frac{12\\ln 2}{16}} - 1\\right)}$\n$CL/F = \\dfrac{3 \\cdot 0.0433147\\,\\mathrm{mg/h}}{0.008\\,\\mathrm{mg/L} \\cdot 0.681793} = \\dfrac{0.129944\\,\\mathrm{mg/h}}{0.0054543\\,\\mathrm{mg\\cdot h/L}}$\n$CL/F \\approx 23.8279\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$\n\nRounding to one decimal place gives $23.8\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $CL/F=\\dfrac{\\text{Dose}}{\\tau\\,C_0}=\\dfrac{3\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{12\\,\\mathrm{h}\\times 0.008\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}}=31.25\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$**\nThis expression calculates clearance using the formula $CL/F = \\text{Dosing Rate} / \\bar{C}_{ss}$, where the dosing rate is $\\text{Dose}/\\tau$. This formula requires the *average* steady-state concentration, $\\bar{C}_{ss}$. The problem provides the *trough* concentration $C_0$, which is the minimum concentration in the dosing interval and is strictly less than the average concentration ($\\bar{C}_{ss} > C_0$). Using $C_0$ in place of $\\bar{C}_{ss}$ incorrectly inflates the calculated clearance.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. $CL/F=\\dfrac{\\text{Dose}\\cdot k}{C_0\\left(1-e^{-k\\tau}\\right)}=\\dfrac{3\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\times \\left(\\ln 2/16\\,\\mathrm{h}\\right)}{0.008\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}\\times \\left(1-e^{-\\left(\\ln 2/16\\,\\mathrm{h}\\right)\\cdot 12\\,\\mathrm{h}}\\right)}\\approx 40.1\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$**\nThis expression is incorrect. The correct expression for trough concentration is $C_0 = \\frac{(F \\cdot \\text{Dose} \\cdot k/CL) \\cdot e^{-k\\tau}}{1 - e^{-k\\tau}}$. Solving this for $CL/F$ would yield $\\frac{CL}{F} = \\frac{\\text{Dose} \\cdot k \\cdot e^{-k\\tau}}{C_0 (1-e^{-k\\tau})}$. The formula in this option is missing the $e^{-k\\tau}$ term in the numerator. The formula shown actually relates clearance to the *peak* concentration ($C_{max,ss}$), not the trough concentration. Using the trough value $C_0$ in this formula is a conceptual error.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. $CL/F=\\dfrac{\\text{Dose}\\cdot k}{C_0\\left(e^{k\\tau}-1\\right)}=\\dfrac{3\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\times \\left(\\ln 2/16\\,\\mathrm{h}\\right)}{0.008\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}\\times \\left(e^{\\left(\\ln 2/16\\,\\mathrm{h}\\right)\\cdot 12\\,\\mathrm{h}}-1\\right)}\\approx 23.9\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$**\nThis expression perfectly matches the one derived from first principles for a one-compartment model under the given assumptions. The numerical value calculated, $23.8279\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$, rounds to $23.8\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$. The value of $23.9\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$ is acceptably close and the discrepancy is likely due to premature rounding of an intermediate constant (e.g., $k$) during the option's calculation. Given that the formula is rigorously correct and the other options are based on incorrect formulas and yield vastly different numerical results, this option is the correct choice.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. $CL/F=\\dfrac{\\text{Dose}\\cdot k}{C_0}=\\dfrac{3\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\times \\left(\\ln 2/16\\,\\mathrm{h}\\right)}{0.008\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}} \\approx 16.2\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$**\nThis expression is dimensionally correct ($(\\mathrm{mg}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1})/(\\mathrm{mg/L}) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{L/h}$), but it does not correspond to a valid pharmacokinetic relationship in this context. It omits the crucial term $(e^{k\\tau}-1)$ from the denominator, which accounts for drug accumulation over multiple doses.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4596693"}, {"introduction": "For immunosuppressants like tacrolimus that bind extensively to red blood cells (RBCs), laboratories report whole-blood concentrations.

The problem's assumptions—that absorption and distribution rate constants are time-invariant and the dosing interval $\\tau$ is constant—ensure that $k$ remains the same before and after the induction event.\n\nApplying this relationship to the pre- and post-induction states:\n$$C_{0, \\text{pre}} = k \\cdot AUC_{\\tau, \\text{pre}}$$\n$$C_{0, \\text{post}} = k \\cdot AUC_{\\tau, \\text{post}}$$\n\nSubstituting the relationship we found between $AUC_{\\tau, \\text{post}}$ and $AUC_{\\tau, \\text{pre}}$:\n$$C_{0, \\text{post}} = k \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\cdot AUC_{\\tau, \\text{pre}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\cdot (k \\cdot AUC_{\\tau, \\text{pre}})$$\n\nFinally, substituting $C_{0, \\text{pre}}$ into the equation yields the expression for the new trough concentration:\n$$C_{0, \\text{post}} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\cdot C_{0, \\text{pre}}$$\nThis result shows that the new steady-state trough concentration is inversely proportional to the factor by which the clearance is increased.\n\n**Task 2: Calculation of the New Dose**\n\nThe objective of Task $2$ is to adjust the cyclosporine dose to counteract the effect of rifampicin induction and maintain the original target trough concentration. Let the new required dose be $\\text{Dose}_{\\text{new}}$ and the original dose be $\\text{Dose}_{\\text{pre}}$. The goal is to achieve $C_{0, \\text{new}} = C_{0, \\text{pre}}$.\n\nUsing the general relationship derived earlier which connects concentration, dose, and clearance:\n$$C_{0} = k \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Dose}}{CL/F}$$\n\nWe can write the expressions for the pre-induction state and the desired new state:\n$$C_{0, \\text{pre}} = k \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{pre}}}{(CL/F)_{\\text{pre}}}$$\n$$C_{0, \\text{new}} = k \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{new}}}{(CL/F)_{\\text{post}}}$$\n\nSetting $C_{0, \\text{new}} = C_{0, \\text{pre}}$:\n$$k \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{new}}}{(CL/F)_{\\text{post}}} = k \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{pre}}}{(CL/F)_{\\text{pre}}}$$\n\nThe proportionality constant $k$ cancels. Solving for $\\text{Dose}_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$\\text{Dose}_{\\text{new}} = \\text{Dose}_{\\text{pre}} \\cdot \\frac{(CL/F)_{\\text{post}}}{(CL/F)_{\\text{pre}}}$$\n\nSubstitute the given relationship $(CL/F)_{\\text{post}} = \\alpha \\cdot (CL/F)_{\\text{pre}}$:\n$$\\text{Dose}_{\\text{new}} = \\text{Dose}_{\\text{pre}} \\cdot \\frac{\\alpha \\cdot (CL/F)_{\\text{pre}}}{(CL/F)_{\\text{pre}}} = \\alpha \\cdot \\text{Dose}_{\\text{pre}}$$\n\nThis demonstrates that to maintain the same trough concentration in the face of increased clearance, the dose must be increased by the same multiplicative factor, $\\alpha$. This relationship holds for the dose per interval and, since the dosing interval is constant, it also holds for the total daily dose.\n\nLet $D_{\\text{total, pre}}$ be the pre-rifampicin total daily dose and $D_{\\text{total, new}}$ be the required new total daily dose.\n$$D_{\\text{total, new}} = \\alpha \\cdot D_{\\text{total, pre}}$$\n\nWe are given $D_{\\text{total, pre}} = 250$ mg/day and $\\alpha = 2.7$.\n$$D_{\\text{total, new}} = 2.7 \\cdot 250 \\, \\text{mg/day}$$\n$$D_{\\text{total, new}} = 675 \\, \\text{mg/day}$$\n\nThe result, $675$, has three significant figures, which matches the requirement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pmatrix{ \\frac{C_{0, \\text{pre}}}{\\alpha} & 675 }}$$", "id": "4596666"}]}
