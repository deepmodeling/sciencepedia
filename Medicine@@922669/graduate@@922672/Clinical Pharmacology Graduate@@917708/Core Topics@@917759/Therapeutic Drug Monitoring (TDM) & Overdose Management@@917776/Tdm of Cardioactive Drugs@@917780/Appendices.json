It represents a standard, formalizable problem in clinical pharmacology.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the time needed to reach $95\\%$ of the steady-state drug concentration, starting from a one-compartment model with first-order elimination.\n\nLet $C(t)$ be the drug concentration in the compartment at time $t$. The dynamics of this system under a constant input rate are described by the linear first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = k_{in} - k_e C(t) $$\nwhere $k_{in}$ is the effective zero-order input rate (representing a constant infusion or the average rate from a maintenance dosing regimen) and $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can rearrange it to:\n$$ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} + k_e C(t) = k_{in} $$\nThis is a linear first-order ODE. We can solve it using an integrating factor, $I(t) = \\exp(\\int k_e dt) = \\exp(k_e t)$. Multiplying the equation by $I(t)$ gives:\n$$ \\exp(k_e t) \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} + k_e \\exp(k_e t) C(t) = k_{in} \\exp(k_e t) $$\nThe left side is the derivative of the product $C(t) \\exp(k_e t)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ C(t) \\exp(k_e t) \\right] = k_{in} \\exp(k_e t) $$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to time from $0$ to $t$, assuming the initial concentration is zero, $C(0) = 0$:\n$$ \\int_0^t \\frac{d}{d\\tau} \\left[ C(\\tau) \\exp(k_e \\tau) \\right] d\\tau = \\int_0^t k_{in} \\exp(k_e \\tau) d\\tau $$\n$$ \\left[ C(\\tau) \\exp(k_e \\tau) \\right]_0^t = k_{in} \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(k_e \\tau)}{k_e} \\right]_0^t $$\n$$ C(t) \\exp(k_e t) - C(0) \\exp(0) = \\frac{k_{in}}{k_e} (\\exp(k_e t) - \\exp(0)) $$\n$$ C(t) \\exp(k_e t) = \\frac{k_{in}}{k_e} (\\exp(k_e t) - 1) $$\nSolving for $C(t)$:\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{k_{in}}{k_e} (1 - \\exp(-k_e t)) $$\nThe asymptotic steady-state concentration, $C_{ss}$, is the limit of $C(t)$ as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$ C_{ss} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} C(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{k_{in}}{k_e} (1 - \\exp(-k_e t)) = \\frac{k_{in}}{k_e} $$\nAt steady state, the rate of input equals the rate of elimination ($k_{in} = k_e C_{ss}$).\n\nThe concentration at time $t$ can be expressed as a fraction of the steady-state concentration:\n$$ C(t) = C_{ss} (1 - \\exp(-k_e t)) $$\nThe problem defines a clinically practical steady state as the time, let's call it $t_{0.95}$, at which the concentration reaches $0.95$ of its asymptotic value, i.e., $C(t_{0.95}) = 0.95 C_{ss}$.\n$$ 0.95 C_{ss} = C_{ss} (1 - \\exp(-k_e t_{0.95})) $$\n$$ 0.95 = 1 - \\exp(-k_e t_{0.95}) $$\n$$ \\exp(-k_e t_{0.95}) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -k_e t_{0.95} = \\ln(0.05) $$\n$$ t_{0.95} = -\\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{k_e} = \\frac{\\ln(1/0.05)}{k_e} = \\frac{\\ln(20)}{k_e} $$\nNext, we must express this time in terms of the elimination half-life, $t_{1/2}$. The half-life is defined as the time required for the concentration to decrease by half during elimination, in the absence of input. This process is governed by $C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-k_e t)$.\nAt $t=t_{1/2}$, $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C_0$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} C_0 = C_0 \\exp(-k_e t_{1/2}) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k_e t_{1/2}) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_e t_{1/2} \\implies -\\ln(2) = -k_e t_{1/2} $$\nThis gives the fundamental auxiliary relationship between the elimination rate constant and the half-life:\n$$ k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $k_e$ into our equation for $t_{0.95}$:\n$$ t_{0.95} = \\frac{\\ln(20)}{k_e} = \\frac{\\ln(20)}{\\ln(2)/t_{1/2}} = t_{1/2} \\frac{\\ln(20)}{\\ln(2)} $$\nThis is the derived expression for the time to reach $95\\%$ of steady state in terms of the half-life.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for digoxin, given $t_{1/2} = 36$ hours.\n$$ t_{0.95} = 36 \\text{ hours} \\times \\frac{\\ln(20)}{\\ln(2)} $$\nUsing the values $\\ln(20) \\approx 2.99573227$ and $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69314718$:\n$$ t_{0.95} \\approx 36 \\times \\frac{2.99573227}{0.69314718} \\approx 36 \\times 4.32192809 $$\n$$ t_{0.95} \\approx 155.58941 \\text{ hours} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the time is $155.6$ hours.\n\nThe pharmacokinetic reasoning for this timescale is that drug accumulation is an inverse exponential process with the same time constant as elimination. The time to reach a certain fraction of steady state is dependent only on the elimination half-life. A common clinical rule of thumb is that it takes $4$ to $5$ half-lives to reach steady state. Our calculation provides a more precise foundation for this rule:\nTime to reach $93.75\\%$ ($1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^4$) of $C_{ss}$ is $4 \\times t_{1/2}$.\nTime to reach $96.875\\%$ ($1 - (\\frac{1}{2})^5$) of $C_{ss}$ is $5 \\times t_{1/2}$.\nOur result of $4.32$ half-lives to reach $95\\%$ of $C_{ss}$ is consistent with and formalizes this heuristic.\n\nThe implications of this result for early Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) of digoxin are significant:\n1.  **Time Since Initiation:** The calculated time to reach a clinically relevant steady state is $155.6$ hours, which is approximately $6.5$ days. This means that any TDM sample taken to assess the appropriateness of a maintenance dose regimen should not be drawn before at least one full week of therapy has passed. A sample drawn earlier (e.g., on day $2$ or $3$) would measure a concentration that is substantially below the true steady-state level, potentially leading to a misguided and dangerous decision to increase the dose.\n2.  **Post-Dose Timing (Distribution Phase):** The calculation is based on a one-compartment model, which is a simplification. Digoxin is better described by a two-compartment model, exhibiting a long distribution phase from the central compartment (blood) to the peripheral compartment (tissues, including the myocardium, its site of action). This phase can last $6$ to $8$ hours. A blood sample drawn during this distribution phase will show a high plasma concentration that does not correlate with the concentration at the site of action and is not reflective of the eventual steady-state trough. Therefore, for TDM of digoxin, it is critical to draw a trough sample, which is taken just before the next dose and, crucially, at least $6$ to $8$ hours after the previous dose to ensure the distribution phase is complete. For a once-daily dosing regimen, a sample taken $24$ hours post-dose (immediately before the next dose) is ideal.\n\nIn summary, for this patient, a TDM sample for digoxin should be obtained no earlier than $7$ days after therapy initiation and should be timed as a trough level, sampled at least $6-8$ hours after the last dose.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{155.6}\n$$", "id": "4596261"}, {"introduction": "Once a patient is at steady state, the goal of TDM shifts to maintenance and adjustment.

At steady state ($ss$), the rate of drug administration (input) equals the rate of drug elimination (output) when averaged over a dosing interval, $\\tau$.\n\n1.  **Rate of Drug Administration (Rate In):**\n    The dose administered is an oral dose, $Dose$. Not all of this dose reaches the systemic circulation; the fraction that does is determined by the oral bioavailability, $F$. Therefore, the amount of drug absorbed into the systemic circulation per dosing interval is $F \\times Dose$. The average rate of drug administration is this amount divided by the dosing interval, $\\tau$.\n    $$\n    \\text{Rate In} = \\frac{F \\times Dose}{\\tau}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Rate of Drug Elimination (Rate Out):**\n    Clearance ($CL$) is defined as the proportionality constant that relates the rate of drug elimination from the body to the plasma concentration, $C$.\n    $$\n    \\text{Rate of Elimination}(t) = CL \\times C(t)\n    $$\n    For a system with linear pharmacokinetics, the average rate of elimination over one dosing interval at steady state is equal to the clearance multiplied by the average steady-state plasma concentration, $C_{ss,avg}$.\n    $$\n    \\text{Average Rate Out} = CL \\times C_{ss,avg}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Steady-State Mass Balance:**\n    By equating the average rate in and the average rate out at steady state, we arrive at the fundamental equation for average steady-state concentration.\n    $$\n    \\text{Rate In} = \\text{Average Rate Out}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{F \\times Dose}{\\tau} = CL \\times C_{ss,avg}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Application to the Problem:**\n    We can rearrange the equation to solve for $C_{ss,avg}$:\n    $$\n    C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\times Dose}{CL \\times \\tau}\n    $$\n    Let the initial state be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final state by subscript $2$.\n    -   Initial state: $C_{ss,avg,1} = \\frac{F_1 \\times Dose_1}{CL_1 \\times \\tau_1}$\n    -   Final state: $C_{ss,avg,2} = \\frac{F_2 \\times Dose_2}{CL_2 \\times \\tau_2}$\n\n    The objective is to find a new dose, $Dose_2$, such that the average steady-state concentration is maintained, i.e., $C_{ss,avg,2} = C_{ss,avg,1}$.\n    The problem states that clearance and dosing interval are unchanged, so $CL_1 = CL_2 = CL$ and $\\tau_1 = \\tau_2 = \\tau$.\n    Setting the two expressions for $C_{ss,avg}$ equal to each other:\n    $$\n    \\frac{F_1 \\times Dose_1}{CL \\times \\tau} = \\frac{F_2 \\times Dose_2}{CL \\times \\tau}\n    $$\n    Since $CL > 0$ and $\\tau > 0$, we can cancel these terms from both sides of the equation, yielding the required relationship:\n    $$\n    F_1 \\times Dose_1 = F_2 \\times Dose_2\n    $$\n    This relationship demonstrates that to maintain the same average steady-state concentration when clearance and dosing interval are constant, the rate of drug absorption ($F \\times Dose / \\tau$), and therefore the systemically available dose per interval ($F \\times Dose$), must remain constant.\n\n5.  **Calculation of the New Dose:**\n    We now solve for the new dose, $Dose_2$:\n    $$\n    Dose_2 = Dose_1 \\times \\frac{F_1}{F_2}\n    $$\n    We are given the following values:\n    -   $Dose_1 = 0.25$ mg\n    -   $F_1 = 0.75$\n    -   $F_2 = 0.50$\n\n    Substituting these values into the equation:\n    $$\n    Dose_2 = 0.25 \\, \\text{mg} \\times \\frac{0.75}{0.50}\n    $$\n    $$\n    Dose_2 = 0.25 \\, \\text{mg} \\times 1.5\n    $$\n    $$\n    Dose_2 = 0.375 \\, \\text{mg}\n    $$\n    The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The measured plasma concentration, $C(t)$, at early time points after a dose is a composite of two phenomena:\n1.  A clinically relevant concentration that is in equilibrium with the peripheral tissues (the site of action), which we denote as $C_{\\text{df}}(t)$ (distribution-free).

This component decays rapidly with the distribution rate constant $\\alpha$.\n\nThe model proposed by the problem is:\n$$C(t) = C_{\\text{df}}(t) + \\Delta C(t)$$\nwhere the surplus term is given by:\n$$\\Delta C(t) = \\Delta C_{0} e^{-\\alpha t}$$\n\nThe clinical goal is to assess the patient's steady-state trough concentration, which corresponds to the distribution-free concentration just before the next dose at $t=24 \\ \\text{h}$, i.e., $C_{\\text{df}}(24)$. Sampling is recommended after the distribution phase is essentially complete (typically after $4$ to $5$ distribution half-lives, or $t \\approx 9$–$12 \\ \\text{h}$), at which point $\\Delta C(t) \\approx 0$ and the measured $C(t) \\approx C_{\\text{df}}(t)$.\n\nIn this case, a sample was drawn prematurely at $t = 4 \\ \\text{h}$, yielding $C(4) = 1.4 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$. To correctly interpret this value, we must first calculate and subtract the distribution surplus at this time.\n\n1.  **Calculate the distribution surplus at $t = 4 \\ \\text{h}$:**\n    Using the given parameters $\\Delta C_{0} = 0.6 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$ and $\\alpha = 0.30 \\ \\text{h}^{-1}$:\n    $$\\Delta C(4) = (0.6 \\ \\text{ng/mL}) \\times e^{-(0.30 \\ \\text{h}^{-1})(4 \\ \\text{h})} = 0.6 \\times e^{-1.2} \\ \\text{ng/mL}$$\n    $$e^{-1.2} \\approx 0.30119$$\n    $$\\Delta C(4) \\approx 0.6 \\times 0.30119 \\ \\text{ng/mL} \\approx 0.1807 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$$\n    Rounding to two decimal places, the surplus is $\\Delta C(4) \\approx 0.18 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the distribution-free concentration at $t = 4 \\ \\text{h}$:**\n    This is the measured concentration minus the surplus:\n    $$C_{\\text{df}}(4) = C(4) - \\Delta C(4) \\approx 1.4 \\ \\text{ng/mL} - 0.18 \\ \\text{ng/mL} = 1.22 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$$\n\n3.  **Project the distribution-free concentration to the trough time ($t = 24 \\ \\text{h}$):**\n    The distribution-free concentration decays according to the elimination rate constant $\\beta = 0.019 \\ \\text{h}^{-1}$. We need to project $C_{\\text{df}}(4)$ forward over a time interval of $\\Delta t = 24 \\ \\text{h} - 4 \\ \\text{h} = 20 \\ \\text{h}$.\n    $$C_{\\text{df}}(24) = C_{\\text{df}}(4) \\times e^{-\\beta \\Delta t} \\approx (1.22 \\ \\text{ng/mL}) \\times e^{-(0.019 \\ \\text{h}^{-1})(20 \\ \\text{h})}$$\n    $$C_{\\text{df}}(24) \\approx 1.22 \\times e^{-0.38} \\ \\text{ng/mL}$$\n    $$e^{-0.38} \\approx 0.68386$$\n    $$C_{\\text{df}}(24) \\approx 1.22 \\times 0.68386 \\ \\text{ng/mL} \\approx 0.8343 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$$\n    Rounding to two decimal places, the estimated trough concentration is $C_{\\text{df}}(24) \\approx 0.83 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$.\n\n4.  **Compare with the target range:**\n    The calculated trough concentration of $0.83 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$ falls within the recommended target range of $0.5$ to $0.9 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$. This indicates the patient's dosing is appropriate.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Multicompartment distribution causes early plasma concentrations to include a transient central compartment surplus that biases measurements high until the distribution term $\\Delta C(t) = \\Delta C_{0} e^{-\\alpha t}$ becomes negligible (typically by $t \\ge 12 \\ \\text{h}$). Using $\\Delta C_{0} = 0.6 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$ and $\\alpha = 0.30 \\ \\text{h}^{-1}$, the residual surplus at $t = 4 \\ \\text{h}$ is $\\Delta C(4) \\approx 0.6 \\times e^{-0.30 \\times 4} \\approx 0.18 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$, so the distribution-free concentration at $4 \\ \\text{h}$ is $C_{\\text{df}}(4) \\approx 1.4 - 0.18 = 1.22 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$. Projecting elimination of this distribution-free term to $24 \\ \\text{h}$ with $\\beta = 0.019 \\ \\text{h}^{-1}$ over $\\Delta t = 20 \\ \\text{h}$ gives $C_{\\text{df}}(24) \\approx 1.22 \\times e^{-0.019 \\times 20} \\approx 0.83 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$, within the target range. Therefore, trough sampling at $12$–$24 \\ \\text{h}$ avoids the early distribution bias and aligns the measurement with tissue equilibrium.**\n- This option correctly describes the qualitative reason for delayed sampling (early bias high due to distribution surplus).\n- It correctly calculates the surplus at $t=4 \\ \\text{h}$ as $\\approx 0.18 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$.\n- It correctly subtracts this surplus to find the distribution-free concentration $C_{\\text{df}}(4) \\approx 1.22 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$.\n- It correctly projects this value forward to the $t=24 \\ \\text{h}$ trough, obtaining $C_{\\text{df}}(24) \\approx 0.83 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$.\n- It correctly concludes this value is within the target range.\nThe reasoning and calculations are entirely consistent with the derivation above.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The $4$-hour sample underestimates exposure because oral absorption is incomplete at $t = 4 \\ \\text{h}$; therefore, trough sampling at $12$–$24 \\ \\text{h}$ is needed to capture the true steady-state concentration, which will be higher than $1.4 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$ at $24 \\ \\text{h}$.**\n- This option is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, the problem explicitly states absorption is complete by $t \\approx 2 \\ \\text{h}$. Second, the $4$-hour sample *overestimates* the clinically relevant equilibrium concentration, it does not underestimate it. Third, drug concentrations decrease over time due to elimination, so the concentration at $24 \\ \\text{h}$ will be lower, not higher, than at $4 \\ \\text{h}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Digoxin behaves effectively as a one-compartment drug at steady state; a $4$-hour sample is interchangeable with a trough sample, so the measured $1.4 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$ should be interpreted as the steady-state SDC for dosing decisions without further adjustment.**\n- This option is fundamentally flawed. It ignores the central concept of the problem: the multicompartment nature of digoxin and the resulting distribution phase. A $4$-hour sample is taken during the distribution phase and is not interchangeable with a post-distribution trough sample. Interpreting $1.4 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$ as the trough would incorrectly suggest toxicity and lead to improper dose adjustment.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Early samples are biased low due to peripheral sequestration; to correct the bias, add $\\Delta C_{0} e^{-\\alpha t}$ to the measured value and then project forward by $e^{-\\beta \\Delta t}$, yielding an estimated $24$-hour trough near $1.62 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$, indicating toxicity.**\n- The reasoning is backwards. Early plasma samples are biased *high* because the drug has not yet fully distributed *out of* the plasma. The correction requires *subtracting*, not adding, the surplus term. The proposed procedure is pharmacokinetically incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Because digoxin has a long elimination half-life, trough sampling at $12$–$24 \\ \\text{h}$ is unnecessary; any sample can be converted to a $24$-hour prediction simply by applying the elimination factor $e^{-\\beta \\Delta t}$, which for the $4$-hour sample gives $1.4 \\times e^{-0.019 \\times 20} \\approx 0.96 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$ without considering distribution.**\n- This option conflates the long elimination half-life with the reason for sampling time. The sampling time is dictated by the *distribution* half-life. It incorrectly assumes a one-compartment model is valid at all times, ignoring the distribution surplus. While the calculation $1.4 \\times e^{-0.38} \\approx 0.96$ is arithmetically correct, it is based on a physically incorrect premise (applying the elimination-only model to a measurement contaminated by distribution surplus). This incorrect approach leads to an overestimation of the trough concentration ($0.96 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$ vs the correct $0.83 \\ \\text{ng/mL}$), which could lead to a different, and potentially wrong, clinical decision.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4596243"}]}
