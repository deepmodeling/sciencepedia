It describes a common and realistic scenario of a prodrug activated by a polymorphic enzyme, leading to inter-individual variability in response. The concepts used—clearance, zero-order input, first-order elimination, steady state, and area under the curve (AUC)—are standard. The problem statement is self-contained, objective, and provides all necessary information to derive the expression and compute the required ratio. There are no contradictions or violations of scientific principles. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem will be solved by applying the principle of mass balance at steady state. At steady state, the rate of input of a substance into the system or a compartment equals its rate of elimination.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the general expression for $AUC_M$**\n\nFirst, consider the prodrug $P$. It is administered at a constant rate $R_{\\text{in}}$. Its total elimination from the body occurs via two parallel first-order pathways, characterized by clearances $CL_{\\text{activation}}$ and $CL_{\\text{other}}$. The total clearance of the prodrug, $CL_P$, is the sum of these parallel clearances:\n$$CL_P = CL_{\\text{activation}} + CL_{\\text{other}}$$\nAt steady state, the rate of administration of $P$ must equal its total rate of elimination:\n$$R_{\\text{in}} = CL_P \\cdot C_{P,ss}$$\nwhere $C_{P,ss}$ is the steady-state concentration of the prodrug. Substituting the expression for $CL_P$, we get:\n$$R_{\\text{in}} = (CL_{\\text{activation}} + CL_{\\text{other}}) \\cdot C_{P,ss}$$\n\nNext, consider the active metabolite $M$. It is formed exclusively from the prodrug $P$ via the activation pathway. The rate of formation of $M$ at steady state, denoted $R_{\\text{form,M,ss}}$, is equal to the rate of elimination of $P$ through this specific pathway:\n$$R_{\\text{form,M,ss}} = CL_{\\text{activation}} \\cdot C_{P,ss}$$\nWe can express $C_{P,ss}$ in terms of $R_{\\text{in}}$ from the prodrug mass balance equation: $C_{P,ss} = \\frac{R_{\\text{in}}}{CL_{\\text{activation}} + CL_{\\text{other}}}$. Substituting this into the equation for the rate of formation of $M$:\n$$R_{\\text{form,M,ss}} = CL_{\\text{activation}} \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{in}}}{CL_{\\text{activation}} + CL_{\\text{other}}} \\right)$$\nAt steady state for the metabolite $M$, its rate of formation must equal its rate of elimination. The rate of elimination of $M$ is given by $CL_{\\text{metabolite}} \\cdot C_{M,ss}$, where $C_{M,ss}$ is the steady-state concentration of the metabolite. However, to find the area under the curve over an interval $\\tau$, $AUC_M$, we use a more fundamental steady-state principle: the total amount of substance eliminated over a dosing interval $\\tau$ must equal the total amount of substance that enters the systemic circulation (i.e., is formed) over that same interval.\n\nThe total amount of $M$ formed over the interval $\\tau$ is:\n$$\\text{Amount}_{M,\\text{formed}} = R_{\\text{form,M,ss}} \\cdot \\tau = \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{in}} \\cdot CL_{\\text{activation}}}{CL_{\\text{activation}} + CL_{\\text{other}}} \\right) \\cdot \\tau$$\nBy definition, clearance relates the rate of elimination to concentration. Integrating over an interval, it relates the total amount eliminated to the area under the concentration-time curve ($AUC$). The total amount of $M$ eliminated over the interval $\\tau$ is:\n$$\\text{Amount}_{M,\\text{eliminated}} = CL_{\\text{metabolite}} \\cdot AUC_M$$\nwhere $AUC_M$ is the area under the curve for the metabolite over the interval $\\tau$ at steady state.\n\nEquating the amount formed to the amount eliminated:\n$$\\text{Amount}_{M,\\text{formed}} = \\text{Amount}_{M,\\text{eliminated}}$$\n$$\\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{in}} \\cdot CL_{\\text{activation}}}{CL_{\\text{activation}} + CL_{\\text{other}}} \\right) \\cdot \\tau = CL_{\\text{metabolite}} \\cdot AUC_M$$\nSolving for $AUC_M$, we obtain the desired general expression:\n$$AUC_M = \\frac{R_{\\text{in}} \\cdot \\tau \\cdot CL_{\\text{activation}}}{(CL_{\\text{activation}} + CL_{\\text{other}}) \\cdot CL_{\\text{metabolite}}}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the fold-change in $AUC_M$**\n\nThe fold-change is the ratio of the $AUC_M$ for the mutant genotype to that of the wild-type genotype.\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{AUC_{M,\\text{Mut}}}{AUC_{M,\\text{WT}}}$$\nUsing the general expression derived above, we can write the expressions for $AUC_{M,\\text{Mut}}$ and $AUC_{M,\\text{WT}}$. The parameters $R_{\\text{in}}$, $\\tau$, $CL_{\\text{other}}$, and $CL_{\\text{metabolite}}$ are identical for both genotypes.\n\nFor the wild-type (WT):\n$$AUC_{M,\\text{WT}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{in}} \\cdot \\tau \\cdot CL_{\\text{activation,WT}}}{(CL_{\\text{activation,WT}} + CL_{\\text{other}}) \\cdot CL_{\\text{metabolite}}}$$\nFor the mutant (Mut):\n$$AUC_{M,\\text{Mut}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{in}} \\cdot \\tau \\cdot CL_{\\text{activation,Mut}}}{(CL_{\\text{activation,Mut}} + CL_{\\text{other}}) \\cdot CL_{\\text{metabolite}}}$$\nNow, we compute the ratio. The common terms ($R_{\\text{in}}$, $\\tau$, $CL_{\\text{metabolite}}$) cancel out:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\frac{CL_{\\text{activation,Mut}}}{CL_{\\text{activation,Mut}} + CL_{\\text{other}}}}{\\frac{CL_{\\text{activation,WT}}}{CL_{\\text{activation,WT}} + CL_{\\text{other}}}}$$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\left( \\frac{CL_{\\text{activation,Mut}}}{CL_{\\text{activation,WT}}} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{CL_{\\text{activation,WT}} + CL_{\\text{other}}}{CL_{\\text{activation,Mut}} + CL_{\\text{other}}} \\right)$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$CL_{\\text{activation,WT}} = 20\\ \\text{L}\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$\n$CL_{\\text{other}} = 30\\ \\text{L}\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$\n$CL_{\\text{activation,Mut}} = \\frac{1}{2} CL_{\\text{activation,WT}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 20\\ \\text{L}\\ \\text{h}^{-1} = 10\\ \\text{L}\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$\n\nPlugging these values into the fold-change expression:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\left( \\frac{10}{20} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{20 + 30}{10 + 30} \\right)$$\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{50}{40} \\right)$$\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{5}{8}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = 0.625$$\nAs this is an exact value, and the requirement is to round to four significant figures if rounding is performed, we present the answer as $0.6250$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6250}$$", "id": "4592091"}, {"introduction": "Even if two individuals achieve identical drug concentrations at the site of action, their responses can differ if their drug targets, such as receptors, are not the same.

It is a standard, formalizable problem in quantitative pharmacology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe concentration–effect relationship is described by the $E_{\\max}$ model, also known as the Hill-Langmuir equation:\n$$E(C) = \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot C^n}{EC_{50}^n + C^n}$$\nwhere $E$ is the pharmacological effect observed at a drug concentration $C$, $E_{\\max}$ is the maximum possible effect, $EC_{50}$ is the concentration required to produce $50\\%$ of the maximum effect, and $n$ is the Hill coefficient, which describes the cooperativity of ligand binding.\n\nWe are asked to find the concentration $C$ that produces an effect equal to a fraction $f$ of $E_{\\max}$. We set $E = f \\cdot E_{\\max}$.\n$$f \\cdot E_{\\max} = \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot C^n}{EC_{50}^n + C^n}$$\nSince $E_{\\max}$ is a non-zero constant, we can divide both sides by $E_{\\max}$:\n$$f = \\frac{C^n}{EC_{50}^n + C^n}$$\nWe now solve this equation for $C$.\n$$f(EC_{50}^n + C^n) = C^n$$\n$$f \\cdot EC_{50}^n + f \\cdot C^n = C^n$$\n$$f \\cdot EC_{50}^n = C^n - f \\cdot C^n$$\n$$f \\cdot EC_{50}^n = C^n(1 - f)$$\n$$C^n = EC_{50}^n \\left(\\frac{f}{1 - f}\\right)$$\nTaking the $n$-th root of both sides gives the general expression for the concentration $C$ required to achieve the fractional effect $f$:\n$$C = EC_{50} \\left(\\frac{f}{1 - f}\\right)^{1/n}$$\nThis equation fulfills the first part of the objective by providing a formula for $C$.\n\nThe problem specifies a target effect fraction of $f = 0.75$. For this value:\n$$\\frac{f}{1 - f} = \\frac{0.75}{1 - 0.75} = \\frac{0.75}{0.25} = 3$$\nSubstituting this into our derived expression for $C$:\n$$C = EC_{50} \\cdot (3)^{1/n}$$\nWe can now write this expression for both the wild-type ($WT$) and variant ($V$) receptors. Let $C_{WT}$ and $C_V$ be the concentrations required to achieve the effect $f=0.75$ in the wild-type and variant individuals, respectively.\nFor the wild-type receptor:\n$$C_{WT} = EC_{50,WT} \\cdot (3)^{1/n}$$\nFor the variant receptor:\n$$C_V = EC_{50,V} \\cdot (3)^{1/n}$$\nThese expressions represent the derived concentrations for the two cases.\n\nThe final step is to find the fold-change in the concentration requirement, which is the ratio $\\frac{C_V}{C_{WT}}$.\n$$\\frac{C_V}{C_{WT}} = \\frac{EC_{50,V} \\cdot (3)^{1/n}}{EC_{50,WT} \\cdot (3)^{1/n}}$$\nThe term $(3)^{1/n}$ is common to both the numerator and the denominator, and thus it cancels out.
