Second, we must compute the numerical value of this efficiency parameter.\n\nLet us begin by formalizing the variables and conditions provided in the problem statement.\n- The substrate concentration is fixed at $[S] = K_{m}$, where $K_{m}$ is the Michaelis constant.\n- The half-maximal inhibitory concentration from the direct measurement (no preincubation) is $IC_{50, \\text{no preinc}} = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n- The half-maximal inhibitory concentration from the experiment with preincubation is $IC_{50, \\text{preinc}} = 0.50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n- The duration of the preincubation is $t_{\\text{preinc}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the analysis of the preincubation experiment, which characterizes the time-dependent inactivation of the enzyme. The problem states that the loss of active enzyme, $[E]_{\\text{active}}$, during this phase follows a first-order process. The rate of this process is governed by an observed first-order rate constant, $k_{\\text{obs}}$.\nThe fraction of enzyme remaining active, $f_{A}$, after a preincubation period of duration $t_{\\text{preinc}}$ at a given inhibitor concentration $[I]$ is given by the first-order decay equation:\n$$f_{A} = \\frac{[E]_{\\text{active}}(t_{\\text{preinc}})}{[E]_{\\text{total}}} = \\exp(-k_{\\text{obs}} t_{\\text{preinc}})$$\nThe problem provides a specific model for $k_{\\text{obs}}$ under the experimental conditions ($[I] \\ll K_{I}$):\n$$k_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{inact}}}{K_{I}} [I]$$\nwhere $k_{\\text{inact}}$ is the maximal rate of inactivation and $K_{I}$ is the dissociation constant for the initial enzyme-inhibitor complex.

Therefore, at an inhibitor concentration of $[I] = IC_{50, \\text{preinc}}$, the fraction of active enzyme must be $f_{A} = 1/2$.\nSetting $f_{A} = 1/2$ and $[I] = IC_{50, \\text{preinc}}$ in our equation yields:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_{\\text{inact}}}{K_{I}} IC_{50, \\text{preinc}} t_{\\text{preinc}}\\right)$$\nTo solve for the kinetic parameters, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{k_{\\text{inact}}}{K_{I}} IC_{50, \\text{preinc}} t_{\\text{preinc}}$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(1/2) = -\\ln(2)$, we simplify the equation to:\n$$-\\ln(2) = -\\frac{k_{\\text{inact}}}{K_{I}} IC_{50, \\text{preinc}} t_{\\text{preinc}}$$\n$$\\ln(2) = \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{inact}}}{K_{I}}\\right) IC_{50, \\text{preinc}} t_{\\text{preinc}}$$\nThis fundamental equation connects the efficiency parameter $k_{\\text{inact}}/K_{I}$ to the experimentally measured values from the preincubation assay.\n\nThe first part of the task is to derive the relationship between the ratio of the two $IC_{50}$ values, $\\frac{IC_{50, \\text{no preinc}}}{IC_{50, \\text{preinc}}}$, and the parameter $\\frac{k_{\\text{inact}}}{K_{I}}$.

The intrinsic clearance represents the maximal metabolic capacity of the liver enzymes, independent of blood flow limitations.\n$$CL_h = \\frac{Q_h \\cdot f_u \\cdot CL_{int,h}}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int,h}}$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the intrinsic clearance, $CL_{int,h}$:\n$$CL_h (Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int,h}) = Q_h \\cdot f_u \\cdot CL_{int,h}$$\n$$CL_h \\cdot Q_h + CL_h \\cdot f_u \\cdot CL_{int,h} = Q_h \\cdot f_u \\cdot CL_{int,h}$$\n$$CL_h \\cdot Q_h = (Q_h \\cdot f_u - CL_h \\cdot f_u) \\cdot CL_{int,h}$$\n$$CL_h \\cdot Q_h = f_u \\cdot (Q_h - CL_h) \\cdot CL_{int,h}$$\n$$CL_{int,h} = \\frac{CL_h \\cdot Q_h}{f_u \\cdot (Q_h - CL_h)}$$\nThis final expression allows for the direct calculation of $CL_{int,h}$ from the measurable quantities $CL_h$, $Q_h$, and $f_u$. The necessary information to calculate $CL_h$ is provided by the intravenous administration data. The oral administration data, while consistent with the overall DDI profile, is not required to answer the specific question about hepatic intrinsic clearance.\n\nFirst, we calculate the baseline clearances.\nThe baseline hepatic clearance, $CL_h$, is:\n$$CL_h = \\frac{Dose_{IV}}{AUC_{IV}} = \\frac{10 \\text{ mg}}{10 \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}} = 1 \\text{ L/h}$$\nNow, we calculate the baseline hepatic intrinsic clearance, $CL_{int,h}$, using the rearranged well-stirred model equation with $Q_h = 90 \\text{ L/h}$ and $f_u = 0.10$:\n$$CL_{int,h} = \\frac{(1 \\text{ L/h}) \\cdot (90 \\text{ L/h})}{0.10 \\cdot (90 \\text{ L/h} - 1 \\text{ L/h})} = \\frac{90}{0.10 \\cdot 89} = \\frac{90}{8.9} = \\frac{900}{89} \\text{ L/h}$$\n\nNext, we perform the same calculations for the scenario with coadministration of drug $D$.

Let's analyze the relationship between AUC, oral dose, and intrinsic clearance. The oral AUC is given by:\n$$ \\mathrm{AUC} = \\frac{F \\cdot \\mathrm{Dose}}{\\mathrm{CL}_{h}} = \\frac{(F_a F_g F_h) \\cdot \\mathrm{Dose}}{\\mathrm{CL}_{h}} $$\nWe can express the term $F_h/\\mathrm{CL}_h$ using the well-stirred model definitions.\n$$ \\frac{F_h}{\\mathrm{CL}_h} = \\frac{1-E_h}{\\mathrm{CL}_h} = \\frac{1 - (\\mathrm{CL}_h/Q_h)}{\\mathrm{CL}_h} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{CL}_h} - \\frac{1}{Q_h} $$\nFrom the well-stirred model equation for $\\mathrm{CL}_h$, we can derive an expression for its reciprocal:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{CL}_h} = \\frac{Q_h + f_{u,b} \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int,tot}}}{Q_h f_{u,b} \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int,tot}}} = \\frac{1}{f_{u,b} \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int,tot}}} + \\frac{1}{Q_h} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $F_h/\\mathrm{CL}_h$:\n$$ \\frac{F_h}{\\mathrm{CL}_h} = \\left(\\frac{1}{f_{u,b} \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int,tot}}} + \\frac{1}{Q_h}\\right) - \\frac{1}{Q_h} = \\frac{1}{f_{u,b} \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int,tot}}} $$\nNow, substituting this simplified term back into the AUC equation:\n$$ \\mathrm{AUC} = (F_a F_g \\mathrm{Dose}) \\left( \\frac{F_h}{\\mathrm{CL}_h} \\right) = \\frac{F_a F_g \\mathrm{Dose}}{f_{u,b} \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int,tot}}} $$\nFor the AUC to be constant, and since $F_a$ and $f_{u,b}$ are constant between the two states, the following equality must hold:\n$$ \\frac{F_{g,base} \\cdot \\mathrm{Dose}_{base}}{\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int,tot,base}}} = \\frac{F_{g,ddi} \\cdot \\mathrm{Dose}_{ddi}}{\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int,tot,ddi}}} $$\nThis gives a greatly simplified a formula for the dose ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{Dose}_{ddi}}{\\mathrm{Dose}_{base}} = \\frac{F_{g,base}}{F_{g,ddi}} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int,tot,ddi}}}{\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int,tot,base}}} $$\nNow we calculate the necessary components.\n\nFirst, calculate the total intrinsic clearance for the baseline state ($\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int,tot,base}}$).\n$$ \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int,tot,base}} = \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int},3A4,base} + \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int},2C9,base} = 700 \\ \\mathrm{L/h} + 300 \\ \\mathrm{L/h} = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{L/h} $$\n\nNext, calculate the total intrinsic clearance for the DDI state ($\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int,tot,ddi}}$).\n- The induction of CYP3A4 increases its $V_{\\max}$ by a factor of $3$. Since intrinsic clearance for a substrate at low concentrations is given by $\\mathrm{CL_{int}} = V_{\\max}/K_{m}$, a $3$-fold increase in $V_{\\max}$ leads to a $3$-fold increase in $\\mathrm{CL_{int}}$.\n$$ \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int},3A4,ddi} = 3 \\times \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int},3A4,base} = 3 \\times 700 \\ \\mathrm{L/h} = 2100 \\ \\mathrm{L/h} $$\n- The competitive inhibition of CYP2C9 increases its apparent Michaelis constant to $K_{m,app} = K_{m,base} \\left(1 + I_{u}/K_{i}\\right)$. The intrinsic clearance is thus reduced.\n$$ \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int},2C9,ddi} = \\frac{V_{\\max,2C9}}{K_{m,app}} = \\frac{V_{\\max,2C9}}{K_{m,base}(1 + I_u/K_i)} = \\frac{\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int},2C9,base}}{1 + I_u/K_i} $$\nGiven $I_u/K_i = 4$:\n$$ \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int},2C9,ddi} = \\frac{300 \\ \\mathrm{L/h}}{1 + 4} = \\frac{300 \\ \\mathrm{L/h}}{5} = 60 \\ \\mathrm{L/h} $$\n- The total intrinsic clearance in the DDI state is the sum of the modified clearances:\n$$ \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int,tot,ddi}} = \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int},3A4,ddi} + \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{int},2C9,ddi} = 2100 \\ \\mathrm{L/h} + 60 \\ \\mathrm{L/h} = 2160 \\ \\mathrm{L/h} $$\n\nFinally, substitute the known and calculated values into the simplified dose ratio formula. The given values for the fraction escaping intestinal metabolism are $F_{g,base} = 0.90$ and $F_{g,ddi} = 0.75$.\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{Dose}_{ddi}}{\\mathrm{Dose}_{base}} = \\frac{0.90}{0.75} \\cdot \\frac{2160 \\ \\mathrm{L/h}}{1000 \\ \\mathrm{L/h}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{Dose}_{ddi}}{\\mathrm{Dose}_{base}} = 1.2 \\cdot 2.16 = 2.592 $$\nThe result $2.592$ has exactly four significant figures as required. Therefore, the original oral dose must be multiplied by a factor of $2.592$ to maintain the same average steady-state concentration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.592}$$", "id": "4553068"}]}
