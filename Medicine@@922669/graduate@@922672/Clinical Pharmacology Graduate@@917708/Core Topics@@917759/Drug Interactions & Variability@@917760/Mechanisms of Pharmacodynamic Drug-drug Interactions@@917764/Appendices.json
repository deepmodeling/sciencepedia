The equilibria, governed by the law of mass action, are:\n$$\n\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{R} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{AR} \\quad \\text{with dissociation constant } K_d = \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{R}]}{[\\mathrm{AR}]}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{I} + \\mathrm{R} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{IR} \\quad \\text{with dissociation constant } K_i = \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}][\\mathrm{R}]}{[\\mathrm{IR}]}\n$$\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R_T]$, is the sum of the free receptors and the receptors bound to either the agonist or the antagonist:\n$$\n[R_T] = [\\mathrm{R}] + [\\mathrm{AR}] + [\\mathrm{IR}]\n$$\nThe fraction of receptors occupied by the agonist, $p_A$, is given by:\n$$\np_A = \\frac{[\\mathrm{AR}]}{[R_T]}\n$$\nTo derive an expression for $p_A$ in terms of the ligand concentrations, we first express $[\\mathrm{R}]$ and $[\\mathrm{IR}]$ in terms of $[\\mathrm{AR}]$:\nFrom the definition of $K_d$, we have $[\\mathrm{R}] = \\frac{K_d [\\mathrm{AR}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]}$.\nFrom the definition of $K_i$, we have $[\\mathrm{IR}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}][\\mathrm{R}]}{K_i}$. Substituting the expression for $[\\mathrm{R}]$, we get $[\\mathrm{IR}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_i} \\left( \\frac{K_d [\\mathrm{AR}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]} \\right)$.\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation for $[R_T]$:\n$$\n[R_T] = \\frac{K_d [\\mathrm{AR}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]} + [\\mathrm{AR}] + \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]K_d [\\mathrm{AR}]}{[\\mathrm{A}]K_i}\n$$\nFactor out $[\\mathrm{AR}]$:\n$$\n[R_T] = [\\mathrm{AR}] \\left( 1 + \\frac{K_d}{[\\mathrm{A}]} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]K_d}{[\\mathrm{A}]K_i} \\right) = [\\mathrm{AR}] \\left( 1 + \\frac{K_d}{[\\mathrm{A}]} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_i} \\right) \\right)\n$$\nThe fractional occupancy $p_A$ is the reciprocal of $\\frac{[R_T]}{[\\mathrm{AR}]}$:\n$$\np_A = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{K_d}{[\\mathrm{A}]} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_i} \\right)} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}]}{[\\mathrm{A}] + K_d \\left( 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_i} \\right)}\n$$\nThe problem states a linear occupancy–response relationship, implying $E = \\epsilon \\cdot p_A$, where $\\epsilon$ is a constant of proportionality. The maximal effect $E_{\\max}$ occurs when all receptors are occupied by the agonist ($p_A = 1$), so $E_{\\max} = \\epsilon$.

The full equation for $E$ is used. $EC_{50}^{\\,\\prime}$ is the concentration $[\\mathrm{A}]$ for which $E = E_{\\max}/2$:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{\\max}}{2} = E_{\\max} \\frac{EC_{50}^{\\,\\prime}}{EC_{50}^{\\,\\prime} + K_d \\left( 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_i} \\right)} \\implies \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{EC_{50}^{\\,\\prime}}{EC_{50}^{\\,\\prime} + K_d \\left( 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_i} \\right)}\n$$\n$$\nEC_{50}^{\\,\\prime} + K_d \\left( 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_i} \\right) = 2 EC_{50}^{\\,\\prime} \\implies EC_{50}^{\\,\\prime} = K_d \\left( 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_i} \\right)\n$$\nThe fold-shift $r$ is defined as $r \\equiv EC_{50}^{\\,\\prime}/EC_{50}$. Substituting the derived expressions:\n$$\nr = \\frac{K_d \\left( 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_i} \\right)}{K_d} = 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_i}\n$$\nThis is the Schild equation, which completes the first part of the task.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $r$ using $K_i = 19\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $[I] = 47\\,\\mathrm{nM}$:\n$$\nr = 1 + \\frac{47}{19} \\approx 1 + 2.473684... = 3.473684...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $r = 3.474$.\n\nFinally, we predict the ratio of maximal effects, $E_{\\max}^{\\,\\prime}/E_{\\max}$.

The maximal system response, $E_{\\text{sys}}$, is achieved when all receptors are occupied by the full agonist $A$. In this case, the fractional occupancy $\\frac{[RA]}{R_T} = 1$, and since $\\epsilon_A = 1$, the total efficacy-weighted occupancy is $1$. Therefore, the proportionality constant is $E_{\\text{sys}}$, and the general expression for the effect is:\n$$E = E_{\\text{sys}} \\left( \\epsilon_A \\frac{[RA]}{R_T} + \\epsilon_B \\frac{[RB]}{R_T} \\right)$$\nOur goal is to express the fractional occupancies, $\\frac{[RA]}{R_T}$ and $\\frac{[RB]}{R_T}$, in terms of ligand concentrations and dissociation constants.\n\nFrom the definition of the dissociation constants, $K_{d,A} = \\frac{[R][A]}{[RA]}$ and $K_{d,B} = \\frac{[R][B]}{[RB]}$, we can express the concentrations of the receptor-ligand complexes in terms of the free receptor concentration $[R]$:\n$$[RA] = \\frac{[R][A]}{K_{d,A}}$$\n$$[RB] = \\frac{[R][B]}{K_{d,B}}$$\nSubstitute these expressions into the total receptor constraint, $R_T = [R] + [RA] + [RB]$:\n$$R_T = [R] + \\frac{[R][A]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{[R][B]}{K_{d,B}}$$\nFactoring out $[R]$ gives:\n$$R_T = [R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{[B]}{K_{d,B}} \\right)$$\nNow, we can find the fractional occupancies. For agonist $A$:\n$$\\frac{[RA]}{R_T} = \\frac{\\frac{[R][A]}{K_{d,A}}}{[R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{[B]}{K_{d,B}} \\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{[A]}{K_{d,A}}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{[B]}{K_{d,B}}}$$\nSimilarly, for agonist $B$:\n$$\\frac{[RB]}{R_T} = \\frac{\\frac{[R][B]}{K_{d,B}}}{[R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{[B]}{K_{d,B}} \\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{[B]}{K_{d,B}}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{[B]}{K_{d,B}}}$$\nSubstituting these fractional occupancies back into the expression for the effect $E$:\n$$E = E_{\\text{sys}} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon_A \\frac{[A]}{K_{d,A}} + \\epsilon_B \\frac{[B]}{K_{d,B}}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{[B]}{K_{d,B}}} \\right)$$\nThis is the general equation for the combined effect of the two agonists.\n\nThe problem specifies a co-infusion protocol where concentrations are scaled by a common factor $s$: $[A] = s\\,C_{A0}$ and $[B] = s\\,C_{B0}$. Substituting these into the effect equation gives the effect as a function of $s$:\n$$E(s) = E_{\\text{sys}} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon_A \\frac{s\\,C_{A0}}{K_{d,A}} + \\epsilon_B \\frac{s\\,C_{B0}}{K_{d,B}}}{1 + \\frac{s\\,C_{A0}}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{s\\,C_{B0}}{K_{d,B}}} \\right)$$\nWe are asked to find the maximal effect of the mixture, $E_{\\max,\\text{mix}}$, which corresponds to the limit as $s \\to \\infty$. This represents saturating concentrations of both drugs.\n$$E_{\\max,\\text{mix}} = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} E(s) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} E_{\\text{sys}} \\left( \\frac{s\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_A C_{A0}}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{\\epsilon_B C_{B0}}{K_{d,B}}\\right)}{1 + s\\left(\\frac{C_{A0}}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{C_{B0}}{K_{d,B}}\\right)} \\right)$$\nTo evaluate this limit, we divide the numerator and the denominator of the fraction inside the parentheses by $s$:\n$$E_{\\max,\\text{mix}} = E_{\\text{sys}} \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\frac{\\epsilon_A C_{A0}}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{\\epsilon_B C_{B0}}{K_{d,B}}}{\\frac{1}{s} + \\frac{C_{A0}}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{C_{B0}}{K_{d,B}}} \\right)$$\nAs $s \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{1}{s} \\to 0$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n$$E_{\\max,\\text{mix}} = E_{\\text{sys}} \\left( \\frac{\\frac{\\epsilon_A C_{A0}}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{\\epsilon_B C_{B0}}{K_{d,B}}}{\\frac{C_{A0}}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{C_{B0}}{K_{d,B}}} \\right)$$\nThis derived expression represents the maximal possible effect from the drug mixture.

We substitute the known values into the Loewe additivity equation:\n$$ \\frac{12.8}{37.2} + \\frac{D_{B, \\text{add}}}{37.2} = 1 $$\nTo solve for $D_{B, \\text{add}}$, we can multiply the entire equation by $37.2$:\n$$ 12.8 + D_{B, \\text{add}} = 37.2 $$\n$$ D_{B, \\text{add}} = 37.2 - 12.8 $$\n$$ D_{B, \\text{add}} = 24.4 \\, \\text{mg} $$\nThus, under Loewe additivity, $12.8$ mg of Drug A would need to be combined with $24.4$ mg of Drug B to achieve the $50\\%$ effect.\n\n**2) Calculation of the Combination Index (CI) and Interaction Type**\n\nThe Combination Index (CI) provides a quantitative measure of the nature of a drug interaction. It is derived directly from the principle of Loewe additivity. For an observed combination ($D_A, D_B$) that produces a specific effect level $x$, the CI is defined as:\n$$ CI_x = \\frac{D_A}{(D_x)_A} + \\frac{D_B}{(D_x)_B} $$\nwhere $(D_x)_A$ and $(D_x)_B$ are the doses of drugs A and B, respectively, required to produce effect $x$ when administered alone. For the $50\\%$ effect level, this becomes:\n$$ CI = \\frac{D_A}{ED_{50,A}} + \\frac{D_B}{ED_{50,B}} $$\nWe are given the observed doses that produce the $50\\%$ effect:\n- $D_A = 12.8$ mg\n- $D_B = 17.6$ mg\n\nThe single-drug doses for the same effect are:\n- $ED_{50,A} = 37.2$ mg\n- $ED_{50,B} = 37.2$ mg\n\nSubstituting these values into the CI equation:\n$$ CI = \\frac{12.8}{37.2} + \\frac{17.6}{37.2} $$\n$$ CI = \\frac{12.8 + 17.6}{37.2} $$\n$$ CI = \\frac{30.4}{37.2} $$\n$$ CI \\approx 0.8172043... $$\nThe problem asks for the CI to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ CI \\approx 0.8172 $$\nThe interpretation of the CI value is as follows:\n- $CI  1$: Synergism (the observed doses are less than the predicted additive doses).\n- $CI = 1$: Additivity (the observed doses match the predicted additive doses).\n- $CI  1$: Antagonism (the observed doses are greater than the predicted additive doses).\n\nSince the calculated $CI \\approx 0.8172$, which is less than $1$, the interaction between Drug A and Drug B at this dose ratio and effect level is **synergistic**. This means that the combination achieves the target effect with lower doses than would be predicted by simple additivity. This is consistent with the result from part (1), where the observed dose of Drug B ($17.6$ mg) is less than the predicted additive dose ($24.4$ mg).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8172}$$", "id": "4566035"}]}
