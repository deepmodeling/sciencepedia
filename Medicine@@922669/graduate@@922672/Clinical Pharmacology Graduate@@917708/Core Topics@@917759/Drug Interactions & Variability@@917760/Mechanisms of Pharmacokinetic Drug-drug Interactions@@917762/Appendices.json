We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe rate of change of the enzyme amount $E(t)$ is the difference between its rate of synthesis and its rate of degradation. This relationship is described by the following linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{syn}} - k_{\\mathrm{deg}}E(t)\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{syn}}$ is the prevailing zero-order synthesis rate.\n\n**Baseline Steady State (for $t < 0$)**\nBefore the inducer is administered, the system is at a steady state, which we denote as $E_{\\mathrm{ss},0}$. At steady state, the enzyme level is constant, so $\\frac{dE}{dt} = 0$. The synthesis rate is the basal rate, $k_{\\mathrm{syn},0}$.\n$$\n0 = k_{\\mathrm{syn},0} - k_{\\mathrm{deg}}E_{\\mathrm{ss},0}\n$$\nSolving for the baseline steady-state enzyme level gives:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{ss},0} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{syn},0}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}}\n$$\nThis is the initial condition for the system at $t=0$, i.e., $E(0) = E_{\\mathrm{ss},0}$.\n\n**Induction Onset (for $t \\ge 0$)**\nAt $t=0$, the synthesis rate is increased to a new constant value $k_{\\mathrm{syn},1}$. The differential equation for $t \\ge 0$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{syn},1} - k_{\\mathrm{deg}}E(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous differential equation, which can be rearranged as:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dt} + k_{\\mathrm{deg}}E(t) = k_{\\mathrm{syn},1}\n$$\nThe general solution can be found using an integrating factor $I(t) = \\exp(\\int k_{\\mathrm{deg}} \\, dt) = \\exp(k_{\\mathrm{deg}}t)$. Multiplying the equation by $I(t)$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(E(t)\\exp(k_{\\mathrm{deg}}t)\\right) = k_{\\mathrm{syn},1}\\exp(k_{\\mathrm{deg}}t)\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $t$:\n$$\nE(t)\\exp(k_{\\mathrm{deg}}t) = \\int k_{\\mathrm{syn},1}\\exp(k_{\\mathrm{deg}}t) \\, dt = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{syn},1}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}}\\exp(k_{\\mathrm{deg}}t) + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. Solving for $E(t)$:\n$$\nE(t) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{syn},1}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}} + C\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg}}t)\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{syn},1}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}}$ represents the new steady-state enzyme level, $E_{\\mathrm{ss},1}$, that will be reached as $t \\to \\infty$. Thus, we can write:\n$$\nE(t) = E_{\\mathrm{ss},1} + C\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg}}t)\n$$\nWe find $C$ by applying the initial condition $E(0) = E_{\\mathrm{ss},0}$:\n$$\nE(0) = E_{\\mathrm{ss},0} = E_{\\mathrm{ss},1} + C\\exp(0) \\implies C = E_{\\mathrm{ss},0} - E_{\\mathrm{ss},1}\n$$\nSubstituting $C$ back into the solution gives the specific solution for the induction phase:\n$$\nE(t) = E_{\\mathrm{ss},1} + (E_{\\mathrm{ss},0} - E_{\\mathrm{ss},1})\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg}}t)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten to better visualize the approach to the new steady state:\n$$\nE(t) = E_{\\mathrm{ss},1} - (E_{\\mathrm{ss},1} - E_{\\mathrm{ss},0})\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg}}t)\n$$\nThis equation explicitly shows that the enzyme level $E(t)$ starts at $E_{\\mathrm{ss},0}$ and approaches its new steady-state value $E_{\\mathrm{ss},1}$ exponentially. The time course of this approach is governed by the exponential term $\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg}}t)$, meaning the rate of approach is determined solely by the degradation rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$.\n\n**Induction Offset (after inducer removal at time $t_{\\mathrm{off}}$)**\nIf the inducer is removed at a time $t_{\\mathrm{off}}$, the synthesis rate reverts to $k_{\\mathrm{syn},0}$. The governing equation for $t > t_{\\mathrm{off}}$ is $\\frac{dE}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{syn},0} - k_{\\mathrm{deg}}E(t)$. The solution takes the same form, but now describes a decay from the level at $t_{\\mathrm{off}}$, call it $E(t_{\\mathrm{off}})$, back towards the original baseline $E_{\\mathrm{ss},0}$:\n$$\nE(t) = E_{\\mathrm{ss},0} + (E(t_{\\mathrm{off}}) - E_{\\mathrm{ss},0})\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg}}(t - t_{\\mathrm{off}}))\n$$\nAgain, the time course of the return to baseline is governed exclusively by the rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$.\n\n**Calculation of the Half-Life of a New Steady State**\nWe are asked to find the time required to reach \"one-half of the new steady-state enzyme level.\" As determined during validation, this is conventionally understood in pharmacokinetics as the half-life of the approach to the new steady state, which is the time required for the enzyme level to cover half the distance from the initial level $E_{\\mathrm{ss},0}$ to the new final level $E_{\\mathrm{ss},1}$.\nLet this time be $t_{1/2}$. At this time, the enzyme level will be:\n$$\nE(t_{1/2}) = E_{\\mathrm{ss},0} + \\frac{1}{2}(E_{\\mathrm{ss},1} - E_{\\mathrm{ss},0}) = \\frac{1}{2}(E_{\\mathrm{ss},0} + E_{\\mathrm{ss},1})\n$$\nWe substitute this into our solution for $E(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}(E_{\\mathrm{ss},0} + E_{\\mathrm{ss},1}) = E_{\\mathrm{ss},1} - (E_{\\mathrm{ss},1} - E_{\\mathrm{ss},0})\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg}}t_{1/2})\n$$\nRearranging to solve for the exponential term:\n$$\n(E_{\\mathrm{ss},1} - E_{\\mathrm{ss},0})\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg}}t_{1/2}) = E_{\\mathrm{ss},1} - \\frac{1}{2}(E_{\\mathrm{ss},0} + E_{\\mathrm{ss},1}) = \\frac{1}{2}(E_{\\mathrm{ss},1} - E_{\\mathrm{ss},0})\n$$\nAssuming $E_{\\mathrm{ss},1} \\neq E_{\\mathrm{ss},0}$ (i.e., induction actually occurs), we can divide by $(E_{\\mathrm{ss},1} - E_{\\mathrm{ss},0})$:\n$$\n\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg}}t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-k_{\\mathrm{deg}}t_{1/2} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2)\n$$\nThus, the half-life of the approach to the new steady state is:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates conclusively that $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$ alone governs the characteristic time of both induction onset and offset, irrespective of the absolute enzyme levels or synthesis rates.\n\n**Final Calculation**\nGiven $k_{\\mathrm{deg}} = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$, we can compute the time $t_{1/2}$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.03\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147...$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{0.03} \\,\\mathrm{h} \\approx 23.1049 \\,\\mathrm{h}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the time is $23.1$ hours.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{23.1}$$", "id": "4566345"}]}
