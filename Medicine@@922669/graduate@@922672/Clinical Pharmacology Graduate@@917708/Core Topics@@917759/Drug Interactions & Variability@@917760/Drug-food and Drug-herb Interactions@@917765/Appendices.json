By working through this problem [@problem_id:4550908], you will develop a quantitative understanding of how to synthesize these competing effects to predict the net change in systemic drug exposure, measured by the Area Under the Curve ($AUC$).", "problem": "An orally administered small-molecule drug exhibits first-pass losses in the gastrointestinal tract and liver. For such drugs, oral bioavailability is decomposed into three multiplicative components: the fraction absorbed across the intestinal epithelium, denoted $F_{a}$; the fraction escaping intestinal presystemic metabolism and transport, denoted $F_{g}$; and the fraction escaping hepatic first-pass extraction, denoted $F_{h}$. Under linear pharmacokinetics, the systemic exposure measured by the Area Under the Plasma Concentration–Time Curve (AUC) depends on oral bioavailability and remains proportional to dose and inversely proportional to clearance when clearance is unchanged. Consider a standardized meal that increases intestinal dissolution and absorption such that $F_{a}$ is raised by $20\\%$ relative to the fasted state, while simultaneously increasing intestinal presystemic biotransformation and/or efflux such that $F_{g}$ decreases by $10\\%$ relative to the fasted state.

The goal is to restore the original steady-state average concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}}$).\n\nWe begin with the foundational principles of pharmacokinetics. The average plasma concentration at steady state, $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}}$, is defined as the total drug exposure over one dosing interval, represented by the area under the plasma concentration-time curve ($\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{ss}}$), divided by the length of the dosing interval, $\\tau$.\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{ss}}}{\\tau}$$\nFor a drug that follows linear, first-order pharmacokinetics, the $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{ss}}$ after oral administration is given by:\n$$\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{\\mathrm{CL}}$$\nwhere $F$ is the absolute bioavailability, $D$ is the administered dose, and $\\mathrm{CL}$ is the total body clearance of the drug.\n\nBy substituting the expression for $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{ss}}$ into the equation for $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}}$, we obtain a comprehensive relationship for the average steady-state concentration:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{\\mathrm{CL} \\cdot \\tau}$$\nThis can be rearranged to highlight the dose-proportionality:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} = \\left(\\frac{F}{\\mathrm{CL}}\\right) \\frac{D}{\\tau}$$\nThe term $\\frac{F}{\\mathrm{CL}}$ represents the systemic exposure achieved per unit of dose.\n\nLet us denote the initial, pre-induction state as State 1 and the post-induction state (with St John's wort) as State 2.\n\nIn State 1, the patient is stabilized on a dose $D_1 = 120$ mg every $\\tau_1 = 12$ h.
