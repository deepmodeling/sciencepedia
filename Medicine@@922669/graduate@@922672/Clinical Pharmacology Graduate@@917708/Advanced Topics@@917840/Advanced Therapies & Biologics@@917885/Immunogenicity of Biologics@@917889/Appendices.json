In the screening tier, any sample with signal above a single cut-point is considered potentially ADA-positive and triaged to confirmatory testing. Assume the following fundamentals: negative sample signals are well-approximated by a normal distribution, the false positive rate is controlled via an upper-tail criterion in this screening tier, and plate-to-plate variation introduces multiplicative bias that can be corrected by appropriate normalization.\n\nFrom first principles and core definitions of quantiles in the normal distribution, derive the expression for an upper-tail screening cut-point that achieves a predefined false positive rate $\\alpha$ for a negative population with mean $\\mu_{\\text{neg}}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\text{neg}}$. Then, explain a scientifically defensible normalization strategy to correct multiplicative plate effects using per-plate negative controls, and apply it to the following data to compute the screening cut-point.\n\nTwo assay plates ($2$ plates) were run under identical conditions except for instrument drift.

We will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for an upper-tail screening cut-point from first principles.\n\nLet $X$ be a random variable representing the signal from a negative control sample. The problem states that these signals are well-approximated by a normal distribution with mean $\\mu_{\\text{neg}}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\text{neg}}$, denoted as $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\text{neg}}, \\sigma_{\\text{neg}}^2)$.\n\nThe false positive rate, $\\alpha$, is defined as the probability that a negative sample produces a signal exceeding the screening cut-point, $CP$. This is expressed as:\n$$P(X > CP) = \\alpha$$\nTo work with a standard distribution, we standardize the random variable $X$. Let $Z$ be the standard normal random variable, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, defined by the transformation:\n$$Z = \\frac{X - \\mu_{\\text{neg}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{neg}}}$$\nWe can rewrite the probability for the cut-point in terms of $Z$:\n$$P\\left(\\frac{X - \\mu_{\\text{neg}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{neg}}} > \\frac{CP - \\mu_{\\text{neg}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{neg}}}\\right) = \\alpha$$\n$$P\\left(Z > \\frac{CP - \\mu_{\\text{neg}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{neg}}}\\right) = \\alpha$$\nThe standard normal distribution has upper-tail quantiles, denoted $z_\\alpha$, which are defined such that $P(Z > z_\\alpha) = \\alpha$. By comparing the two probability statements, we can equate their arguments:\n$$\\frac{CP - \\mu_{\\text{neg}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{neg}}} = z_\\alpha$$\nSolving for the cut-point, $CP$, yields the general expression:\n$$CP = \\mu_{\\text{neg}} + z_\\alpha \\sigma_{\\text{neg}}$$\nThis expression defines the cut-point as the mean of the negative population plus a multiple of its standard deviation, where the multiple is determined by the desired false positive rate $\\alpha$.\n\nNext, we address the normalization strategy. Plate-to-plate variation, which manifests as a multiplicative bias, is a source of systematic error that can compromise the validity of a fixed cut-point across different assay plates. The goal of normalization is to adjust the raw data to remove this technical variability, making results from different plates comparable. The problem specifies a multiplicative model where an observed signal $x_{p,i}$ from well $i$ on plate $p$ is assumed to be the product of a true underlying signal and a plate-specific effect. The specified normalization strategy uses the mean of the negative controls on each plate, $\\bar{x}_p$, as an estimate of the plate's multiplicative bias. A normalization factor, $f_p = \\bar{x}_{\\text{ref}} / \\bar{x}_p$, is calculated for each plate $p$. Here, $\\bar{x}_{\\text{ref}}$ is a stable, run-wide reference level, chosen in this problem to be the median of the per-plate means. Each raw data point $x_{p,i}$ is then transformed into a normalized value $y_{p,i}$ by multiplication: $y_{p,i} = f_p x_{p,i}$. This procedure scales the data from each plate such that the mean of their respective negative controls is adjusted to the common reference level $\\bar{x}_{\\text{ref}}$, thereby correcting for the mean-level inter-plate bias.\n\nFinally, we apply this methodology to compute the specific screening cut-point for the given data.\n\nThe provided data are:\n- Plate 1: $n_1 = 80$, $\\bar{x}_1 = 1200$, $s_1 = 180$.\n- Plate 2: $n_2 = 90$, $\\bar{x}_2 = 1500$, $s_2 = 220$.\n- Reference mean: $\\bar{x}_{\\text{ref}} = 1350$.\n- False positive rate: $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\nThe quantile $z_\\alpha$ for $\\alpha = 0.05$ is the value such that the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution is $1 - 0.05 = 0.95$. From standard statistical tables, $z_{0.05} \\approx 1.645$.\n\nWe begin by calculating the normalization factors for each plate:\n- For plate 1: $f_1 = \\frac{\\bar{x}_{\\text{ref}}}{\\bar{x}_1} = \\frac{1350}{1200} = 1.125$.\n- For plate 2: $f_2 = \\frac{\\bar{x}_{\\text{ref}}}{\\bar{x}_2} = \\frac{1350}{1500} = 0.9$.\n\nNext, we determine the statistics of the normalized data. The mean of the normalized data on each plate becomes $\\bar{y}_p = f_p \\bar{x}_p = \\frac{\\bar{x}_{\\text{ref}}}{\\bar{x}_p} \\bar{x}_p = \\bar{x}_{\\text{ref}}$. Thus, the mean of the combined, normalized negative control population is estimated by $\\mu_{\\text{neg, norm}} = \\bar{x}_{\\text{ref}} = 1350$.\n\nThe standard deviation of the data on each plate is also scaled by the normalization factor. The new, normalized sample standard deviations, $s'_p$, are:\n- For plate 1: $s'_1 = f_1 s_1 = 1.125 \\times 180 = 202.5$.\n- For plate 2: $s'_2 = f_2 s_2 = 0.9 \\times 220 = 198$.\n\nTo obtain a single estimate for the standard deviation of the normalized negative population, we use the unbiased pooled variance estimator, $s_{\\text{pooled}}^2$:\n$$s_{\\text{pooled}}^2 = \\frac{(n_1 - 1)(s'_1)^2 + (n_2 - 1)(s'_2)^2}{(n_1 - 1) + (n_2 - 1)}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$s_{\\text{pooled}}^2 = \\frac{(80 - 1)(202.5)^2 + (90 - 1)(198)^2}{(80 - 1) + (90 - 1)}$$\n$$s_{\\text{pooled}}^2 = \\frac{79 \\times 41006.25 + 89 \\times 39204}{79 + 89}$$\n$$s_{\\text{pooled}}^2 = \\frac{3239593.75 + 3489156}{168} = \\frac{6728749.75}{168} \\approx 40052.0818$$\nThe pooled standard deviation, $s_{\\text{pooled}}$, is the square root of the pooled variance:\n$$s_{\\text{pooled}} = \\sqrt{40052.0818} \\approx 200.1302$$\nThis serves as our estimate for $\\sigma_{\\text{neg, norm}}$.\n\nNow, we can compute the normalized cut-point, $CP_{\\text{norm}}$, using the derived formula with the statistics of the normalized population:\n$$CP_{\\text{norm}} = \\mu_{\\text{neg, norm}} + z_\\alpha \\sigma_{\\text{neg, norm}}$$\n$$CP_{\\text{norm}} = \\bar{x}_{\\text{ref}} + z_{0.05} s_{\\text{pooled}}$$\n$$CP_{\\text{norm}} \\approx 1350 + 1.64485 \\times 200.1302$$\n$$CP_{\\text{norm}} \\approx 1350 + 329.1869$$\n$$CP_{\\text{norm}} \\approx 1679.1869$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$CP_{\\text{norm}} \\approx 1679$$\nThe screening cut-point, after correcting for multiplicative plate effects, is $1679$ RLU.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1679}\n$$", "id": "4559873"}, {"introduction": "Once an assay is developed, its performance in a real-world clinical setting must be critically evaluated.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The provided quantitative parameters are realistic and consistent. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the competitive binding equilibrium between the ADA, the circulating drug in the patient's sample, and the drug reagents used in the assay. We will use the law of mass action to model this system.\n\nIn a bridging assay, an ADA molecule must be bivalent and have its paratopes (binding sites) free to simultaneously bind a capture drug-reagent and a detection drug-reagent. Let $[A]_T$ be the total concentration of ADA, given as $A_T = 100\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$ for the purpose of assessing drug tolerance. The detected species is the free, bivalent ADA, which we denote $[A]_{free}$. The assay's lower detection threshold is $A_{\\min} = 25\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$. A sample is deemed ADA-positive if the measured $[A]_{free}$ exceeds a cutoff related to $A_{\\min}$.\n\nThe binding of a single ADA paratope ($P$) to the drug ($D$) is governed by the equilibrium:\n$$ P + D \\rightleftharpoons PD $$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, for this interaction is given as $K_d = 1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[P]_{free}[D]_{free}}{[PD]} $$\nHere, $[P]_{free}$ is the concentration of free paratopes, $[D]_{free}$ is the concentration of free drug, and $[PD]$ is the concentration of drug-bound paratopes.\n\nThe total concentration of circulating drug, $C$, can be as high as $100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g/mL}$. The total ADA concentration, $A_T$, is $100\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$, which is equivalent to $0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g/mL}$. Since $C \\gg A_T$, the amount of drug bound to ADA is negligible compared to the total drug amount. Therefore, we can approximate the free drug concentration $[D]_{free}$ with the total circulating drug concentration $C$.\n\n$[D]_{free} \\approx C$\n\nFrom the law of mass action, the fraction of paratopes that are free is:\n$$ \\frac{[P]_{free}}{[P]_{total}} = \\frac{[P]_{free}}{[P]_{free} + [PD]} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[PD]}{[P]_{free}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[D]_{free}}{K_d}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{C}{K_d}} = \\frac{K_d}{K_d + C} $$\nFor an ADA molecule to be detected in a bridging assay, it must have (at least) two free paratopes. Assuming the two paratopes of an IgG molecule bind independently, the probability that both are free is the square of the probability that a single site is free. Therefore, the concentration of detectable bivalent ADA is:\n$$ [A]_{free} \\approx A_T \\left( \\frac{K_d}{K_d + C} \\right)^2 $$\nFor the assay to successfully detect the ADA at the specified level $A_T=100\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$, the concentration of free ADA must be above the detection threshold, $A_{\\min}=25\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$.\n$$ A_T \\left( \\frac{K_d}{K_d + C} \\right)^2 > A_{\\min} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ 100\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL} \\left( \\frac{K_d}{K_d + C} \\right)^2 > 25\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL} $$\n$$ \\left( \\frac{K_d}{K_d + C} \\right)^2 > \\frac{25}{100} = 0.25 $$\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n$$ \\frac{K_d}{K_d + C} > 0.5 $$\n$$ K_d > 0.5(K_d + C) $$\n$$ K_d > 0.5 K_d + 0.5 C $$\n$$ 0.5 K_d > 0.5 C $$\n$$ K_d > C $$\nThis derivation shows that for the assay to detect ADA under these conditions, the circulating drug concentration $C$ must be less than the dissociation constant $K_d$. The problem states $K_d \\approx 0.15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g/mL}$ and that circulating drug $C$ ranges up to $100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g/mL}$.\nWhenever $C > K_d$ (e.g., at any typical post-dose concentration such as $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g/mL}$, $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g/mL}$, or $100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g/mL}$), the condition for detection is not met. The circulating drug forms immune complexes with the ADA, sequestering it and reducing the free, bivalent ADA concentration below the assay's detection limit $A_{\\min}$. This leads to a false negative result: a sample containing a significant amount of total ADA ($A_T = 100\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$) is incorrectly reported as ADA-negative. This phenomenon is known as drug interference, and the maximum drug concentration $C$ that an assay can tolerate while still detecting a pre-specified level of ADA is called its \"drug tolerance.\"\n\nNow we evaluate each statement.\n\nA. In ADA assays, drug tolerance is the maximum circulating drug concentration at which the assay can still detect a prespecified ADA level; in bridging formats, high drug concentrations form immune complexes that sequester ADA and reduce free bivalent ADA below the detection threshold, biasing observed incidence toward false negatives, particularly at post-dose time points.\nThis statement provides the correct bioanalytical definition of drug tolerance. It correctly identifies the mechanism in bridging assays: formation of immune complexes that sequester ADA, leading to a reduction in the signal-generating species (free bivalent ADA). It correctly states the consequence, a bias toward false negatives. Finally, it correctly notes that this effect is most pronounced at post-dose time points when drug concentrations are typically at their peak.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Drug tolerance refers to a patient's ability to tolerate the pharmacologic drug without adverse reactions; circulating drug increases assay signal via formation of larger immune complexes, thus biasing incidence toward false positives.\nThis statement confuses the bioanalytical definition of \"drug tolerance\" with the clinical definition. In the context of ADA assays, drug tolerance is an assay performance characteristic, not a patient response. Furthermore, it incorrectly claims that circulating drug increases the assay signal. As derived above, circulating drug competes with the assay reagents and *decreases* the signal. Consequently, the bias is toward false negatives, not false positives.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Under conditions where circulating drug concentration $C$ greatly exceeds the ADA-drug dissociation constant $K_d$, mass-action equilibrium implies that the free ADA available to bind assay reagents decreases as $C$ increases; without drug removal or acid dissociation, bridging ADA assays will tend to under-call positives, a bias that can be mitigated by sampling at trough or by incorporating dissociation steps.\nThis statement accurately describes the consequences of the law of mass action when $C \\gg K_d$, which, as shown in our quantitative analysis, is the typical situation post-dose. It correctly states that this leads to an under-calling of positives (i.e., false negatives). It also correctly lists two standard mitigation strategies: pharmacokinetic sampling at trough drug concentration and implementing a procedural step like acid dissociation to break the immune complexes prior to analysis.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. Drug tolerance is defined operationally by the signal-to-noise ratio at zero ADA; therefore, it is independent of circulating drug concentrations and cannot cause false negatives; only matrix effects matter.\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The signal-to-noise ratio at zero analyte concentration is related to the assay's limit of blank and limit of detection, which define analytical sensitivity, not drug tolerance. Drug tolerance is, by definition, a measure of an assay's performance *in the presence of the drug*. Therefore, it is entirely dependent on circulating drug concentration. The claim that it cannot cause false negatives is a direct contradiction of the established principles.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Non-bridging or competitive ADA assay formats that incorporate acid dissociation steps can increase drug tolerance by releasing ADA from ADA–drug immune complexes, thereby restoring free ADA toward its total concentration $A_T$ across a wide range of $C$, reducing false negatives in the presence of drug.\nThis statement correctly identifies a primary strategy for improving drug tolerance. Acid dissociation is a sample pre-treatment step designed to break the in-vivo formed ADA-drug complexes. By dissociating these complexes, the total ADA ($A_T$) becomes available for binding to the assay reagents, rather than just the small fraction of free ADA. This makes the measurement far less susceptible to the concentration of circulating drug $C$, thereby increasing the assay's drug tolerance and reducing the incidence of false negatives. This technique can be applied to various assay formats, including but not limited to non-bridging or competitive formats, to achieve this goal.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "4559852"}, {"introduction": "The clinical significance of immunogenicity often lies in its impact on drug exposure and efficacy, which is mediated by changes in pharmacokinetics (PK).

We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system describes the interaction between a drug ($D$) and its anti-drug antibody ($A$) to form an immune complex ($C$). The dynamics of the free drug concentration, $D(t)$, and the immune complex concentration, $C(t)$, can be described by a system of differential equations based on mass-balance principles.\n\nThe rate of change of the free drug concentration in the central compartment of volume $V$ is determined by three processes: baseline linear elimination, binding to ADA, and dissociation from the immune complex.

This justifies the use of a quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) for the immune complex. Under the QSSA, we assume that the concentration of the complex $C(t)$ rapidly equilibrates with the free drug concentration $D(t)$, such that its rate of change is approximately zero, i.e., $\\frac{dC}{dt} \\approx 0$.\nApplying this approximation to the equation for $C(t)$:\n$$ 0 \\approx k_{\\text{on}} A D(t) - (k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{clear,IC}}) C(t) $$\nWe can now solve for the quasi-steady-state concentration of the complex, $C_{QSS}(t)$, as a function of $D(t)$:\n$$ C_{QSS}(t) = \\frac{k_{\\text{on}} A D(t)}{k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{clear,IC}}} $$\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for $C(t)$ back into the differential equation for $D(t)$ to obtain a single equation describing the drug's disposition:\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = -k_{\\text{el}} D(t) - k_{\\text{on}} A D(t) + k_{\\text{off}} \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{on}} A D(t)}{k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{clear,IC}}} \\right) $$\nWe can factor out $D(t)$ to find the apparent first-order elimination rate constant, $k_{\\text{el,app}}$:\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = \\left[ -k_{\\text{el}} - k_{\\text{on}} A + \\frac{k_{\\text{off}} k_{\\text{on}} A}{k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{clear,IC}}} \\right] D(t) $$\nLet's simplify the term in the brackets by combining the terms involving $k_{\\text{on}} A$:\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = \\left[ -k_{\\text{el}} - k_{\\text{on}} A \\left( 1 - \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{clear,IC}}} \\right) \\right] D(t) $$\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = \\left[ -k_{\\text{el}} - k_{\\text{on}} A \\left( \\frac{(k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{clear,IC}}) - k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{clear,IC}}} \\right) \\right] D(t) $$\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = \\left[ -k_{\\text{el}} - k_{\\text{on}} A \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{clear,IC}}}{k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{clear,IC}}} \\right) \\right] D(t) $$\nThe equation is now in the form $\\frac{dD}{dt} = -k_{\\text{el,app}} D(t)$, where the effective first-order elimination rate constant, $k_{\\text{el,app}}$, is:\n$$ k_{\\text{el,app}} = k_{\\text{el}} + k_{\\text{on}} A \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{clear,IC}}}{k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{clear,IC}}} \\right) $$\nSubstituting $k_{\\text{el}} = \\frac{CL}{V}$:\n$$ k_{\\text{el,app}} = \\frac{CL}{V} + k_{\\text{on}} A \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{clear,IC}}}{k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{clear,IC}}} \\right) $$\nThis expression represents the total elimination rate constant, which is the sum of the baseline elimination rate and an additional rate due to ADA-mediated clearance.\n\nThe apparent clearance, $CL_{\\text{app}}$, is related to the apparent elimination rate constant by the definition $CL_{\\text{app}} = k_{\\text{el,app}} \\cdot V$. Substituting the derived expression for $k_{\\text{el,app}}$:\n$$ CL_{\\text{app}} = \\left( \\frac{CL}{V} + k_{\\text{on}} A \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{clear,IC}}}{k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{clear,IC}}} \\right) \\right) V $$\n$$ CL_{\\text{app}} = CL + V k_{\\text{on}} A \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{clear,IC}}}{k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{clear,IC}}} \\right) $$\nThis expression for $CL_{\\text{app}}$ is in terms of the given parameters. The total clearance is the sum of the drug's intrinsic clearance and the clearance mediated by the immune complex pathway.\n\nFinally, we need to compute the area under the concentration-time curve from $t=0$ to infinity, $\\text{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty}$. For a drug administered as an intravenous bolus dose, $\\text{Dose}$, that follows linear first-order elimination, the AUC is given by:\n$$ \\text{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}}{CL_{\\text{app}}} $$\nUnder the QSSA, our model simplifies to a linear one-compartment model with clearance $CL_{\\text{app}}$, so this formula is applicable.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the expression for $CL_{\\text{app}}$:\n- $V = 3$ L\n- $CL = 0.3$ L$\\cdot$h$^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\text{on}} = 0.02$ L$\\cdot$mg$^{-1}\\cdot$h$^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\text{off}} = 0.05$ h$^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\text{clear,IC}} = 0.15$ h$^{-1}$\n- $A = 5$ mg$\\cdot$L$^{-1}$\n- $\\text{Dose} = 100$ mg\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless fraction that governs the partitioning of the immune complex:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\text{clear,IC}}}{k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{clear,IC}}} = \\frac{0.15 \\text{ h}^{-1}}{0.05 \\text{ h}^{-1} + 0.15 \\text{ h}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.15}{0.20} = 0.75 $$\nNow, we calculate the additional clearance due to the ADA:\n$$ \\text{Added Clearance} = V k_{\\text{on}} A \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{clear,IC}}}{k_{\\text{off}} + k_{\\text{clear,IC}}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\text{Added Clearance} = (3 \\text{ L}) \\times (0.02 \\text{ L}\\cdot\\text{mg}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1}) \\times (5 \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{L}^{-1}) \\times (0.75) $$\n$$ \\text{Added Clearance} = (3 \\times 0.02 \\times 5 \\times 0.75) \\text{ L}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1} = 0.225 \\text{ L}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1} $$\nThe total apparent clearance is:\n$$ CL_{\\text{app}} = CL + \\text{Added Clearance} = 0.3 \\text{ L}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1} + 0.225 \\text{ L}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1} = 0.525 \\text{ L}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1} $$\nNow we can compute the $\\text{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty}$:\n$$ \\text{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}}{CL_{\\text{app}}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ mg}}{0.525 \\text{ L}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\text{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty} \\approx 190.47619... \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{h}\\cdot\\text{L}^{-1} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$ \\text{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty} = 190.5 \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{h}\\cdot\\text{L}^{-1} $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{190.5}\n$$", "id": "4559897"}]}
