A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe problem requires deriving and solving a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the cytosolic mRNA concentration, $M(t)$, and the protein concentration, $P(t)$, for time $t \\geq 0$.\n\nFirst, we formulate the ODE for the mRNA concentration, $M(t)$.\nAccording to assumption (i), mRNA degrades via a first-order process. The rate of change of $M(t)$ is thus negatively proportional to $M(t)$ itself. The constant of proportionality is the degradation rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{deg},M}$. There is no production of mRNA for $t>0$ as the delivery is an instantaneous bolus at $t=0$.\nThe governing ODE for $M(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} = -k_{\\mathrm{deg},M} M(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ODE. The general solution is of the form $M(t) = C \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},M} t)$, where $C$ is a constant of integration. We use the initial condition $M(0) = M_{0}$ to find $C$:\n$$ M(0) = C \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},M} \\cdot 0) = C \\cdot 1 = M_{0} $$\nThus, $C = M_{0}$. The solution for the mRNA concentration is:\n$$ M(t) = M_{0} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},M} t) $$\n\nNext, we formulate the ODE for the protein concentration, $P(t)$.\nThe rate of change of $P(t)$ is the rate of protein synthesis (translation) minus the rate of protein degradation.\nAccording to assumption (iii), the rate of translation is proportional to the cytosolic mRNA concentration, $M(t)$, with a rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{trans}}$. So, the rate of synthesis is $k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M(t)$.\nAccording to assumption (ii), the protein degrades via a first-order process with a rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{deg},P}$. So, the rate of degradation is $k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} P(t)$.\nThe governing ODE for $P(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M(t) - k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} P(t) $$\nWe substitute the expression for $M(t)$ into this equation:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M_{0} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},M} t) - k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} P(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ODE. We can rearrange it into the standard form $\\frac{dy}{dx} + p(x)y = q(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} + k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} P(t) = k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M_{0} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},M} t) $$\nWe solve this ODE using the method of integrating factors. The integrating factor, $I(t)$, is given by:\n$$ I(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} \\,dt\\right) = \\exp(k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} t) $$\nMultiplying the entire ODE by $I(t)$:\n$$ \\exp(k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} t) \\frac{dP}{dt} + k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} \\exp(k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} t) P(t) = k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M_{0} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},M} t) \\exp(k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} t) $$\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of the product $P(t) I(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left[P(t) \\exp(k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} t)\\right] = k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M_{0} \\exp((k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} - k_{\\mathrm{deg},M})t) $$\nNow, we integrate both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$ \\int \\frac{d}{dt}\\left[P(t) \\exp(k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} t)\\right] dt = \\int k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M_{0} \\exp((k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} - k_{\\mathrm{deg},M})t) dt $$\n$$ P(t) \\exp(k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} t) = k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M_{0} \\frac{\\exp((k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} - k_{\\mathrm{deg},M})t)}{k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} - k_{\\mathrm{deg},M}} + C' $$\nwhere $C'$ is the constant of integration. Note that this step is valid because the problem states $k_{\\mathrm{deg},M} \\neq k_{\\mathrm{deg},P}$, so the denominator $k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} - k_{\\mathrm{deg},M}$ is non-zero.\nTo find the general solution for $P(t)$, we multiply by $\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} t)$:\n$$ P(t) = k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M_{0} \\frac{\\exp((k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} - k_{\\mathrm{deg},M})t) \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} t)}{k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} - k_{\\mathrm{deg},M}} + C' \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} t) $$\n$$ P(t) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} - k_{\\mathrm{deg},M}} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},M} t) + C' \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} t) $$\nTo determine the constant $C'$, we apply the initial condition $P(0) = P_{0}$:\n$$ P(0) = P_{0} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} - k_{\\mathrm{deg},M}} \\exp(0) + C' \\exp(0) $$\n$$ P_{0} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} - k_{\\mathrm{deg},M}} + C' $$\nSolving for $C'$:\n$$ C' = P_{0} - \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} - k_{\\mathrm{deg},M}} $$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $C'$ back into the general solution for $P(t)$:\n$$ P(t) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} - k_{\\mathrm{deg},M}} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},M} t) + \\left(P_{0} - \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} - k_{\\mathrm{deg},M}}\\right) \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} t) $$\nWe can rearrange this expression by grouping terms:\n$$ P(t) = P_{0} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} t) - \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} - k_{\\mathrm{deg},M}} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} t) + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} - k_{\\mathrm{deg},M}} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},M} t) $$\nFactoring out the common term gives the final closed-form expression for $P(t)$:\n$$ P(t) = P_{0} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} t) + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} - k_{\\mathrm{deg},M}} \\left( \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},M} t) - \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} t) \\right) $$\nThis equation describes the protein concentration over time, accounting for the decay of the initial protein amount and the new protein produced from the transient mRNA template.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{P(t) = P_{0} \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} t) + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{trans}} M_{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} - k_{\\mathrm{deg},M}} \\left( \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},M} t) - \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{deg},P} t) \\right)}\n$$", "id": "4580026"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to mRNA therapies that produce proteins, small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapies are designed to reduce the levels of specific target proteins by degrading their corresponding mRNA.

Assume the following principles derived from the Central Dogma and standard pharmacodynamic turnover models: translation yields protein at a rate proportional to the mRNA abundance, and protein is cleared by a first-order process. Let the plasma protein concentration be $P(t)$ and the target mRNA abundance be $M(t)$. Under baseline homeostasis, $M(t)$ is constant at $M_{0}$, translation occurs with rate constant $k_{\\text{tr}}$ (that is, synthesis rate $k_{\\text{tr}} M(t)$), and protein is cleared with first-order rate constant $k_{\\text{out}}$.

The derivation begins with the provided ordinary differential equation (ODE) that governs the plasma protein turnover.\n\nThe governing ODE for the protein concentration $P(t)$ is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = k_{\\text{tr}} M(t) - k_{\\text{out}} P(t)\n$$\nwhere $M(t)$ is the target mRNA abundance, $k_{\\text{tr}}$ is the translation rate constant, and $k_{\\text{out}}$ is the first-order protein clearance rate constant.\n\nA steady-state condition is achieved when the concentration of the protein no longer changes with time.

Substituting this into the general steady-state solution gives:\n$$\nP_{\\text{ss,baseline}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{tr}}}{k_{\\text{out}}} M_0\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the steady-state protein concentration after the administration of a fully efficacious siRNA, denoted $P_{\\text{ss,siRNA}}$. The problem states that the siRNA reduces the available target mRNA abundance by a fraction $f$, resulting in a new, constant effective mRNA abundance of $(1 - f) M_0$. Therefore, for the post-treatment steady state, $M_{\\text{ss}} = (1 - f) M_0$.
