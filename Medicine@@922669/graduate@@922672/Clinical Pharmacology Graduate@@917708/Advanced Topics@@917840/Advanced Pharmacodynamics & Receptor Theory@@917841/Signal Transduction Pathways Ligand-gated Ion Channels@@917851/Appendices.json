The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe primary goal is to derive an expression for the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, in terms of the free agonist concentration, $[A]$, and the dissociation constant, $K_{d}$. We begin with the provided definitions.\n\nThe definition for the dissociation constant is:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[A][R]}{[AR]}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to express the concentration of unbound receptors, $[R]$, in terms of other variables:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_{d} [AR]}{[A]}$$\nThe total receptor concentration, $R_{T}$, is the sum of the unbound receptor concentration, $[R]$, and the agonist-receptor complex concentration, $[AR]$:\n$$R_{T} = [R] + [AR]$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[R]$ from the rearranged $K_{d}$ equation into the equation for $R_{T}$:\n$$R_{T} = \\left( \\frac{K_{d} [AR]}{[A]} \\right) + [AR]$$\nWe can factor out the term $[AR]$ on the right-hand side of the equation:\n$$R_{T} = [AR] \\left( \\frac{K_{d}}{[A]} + 1 \\right)$$\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of agonist–receptor complex, $[AR]$, to the total receptor concentration, $R_{T}$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[AR]}{R_{T}}$$\nBy rearranging the previous equation for $R_{T}$, we can find an expression for this ratio:\n$$\\frac{[AR]}{R_{T}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{d}}{[A]} + 1}$$\nTherefore, the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ is:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{d}}{[A]} + 1}$$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[A]$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{1 \\cdot [A]}{[A]\\left(\\frac{K_{d}}{[A]} + 1\\right)} = \\frac{[A]}{K_{d} + [A]}$$\nThis expression, known as the Hill-Langmuir equation for non-cooperative binding (Hill coefficient of $1$), gives the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ solely in terms of $[A]$ and $K_{d}$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\theta$ using the provided data: $[A] = 7.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $K_{d} = 2.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{7.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{2.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 7.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}$$\nThe units of concentration ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) cancel, yielding a dimensionless fraction, as expected for occupancy:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{7.5}{10.0} = 0.75$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\theta = 0.7500$$\n\nFinally, we interpret this result. A fractional occupancy of $\\theta = 0.7500$ means that under the specified steady-state conditions, $75\\%$ of the total available ionotropic receptors are occupied by the agonist. The problem states that the agonist has \"high intrinsic efficacy,\" which is the property of an agonist-receptor complex to evoke a cellular response. A high-efficacy agonist can produce a maximal or near-maximal response even without occupying $100\\%$ of the receptors. Therefore, a $75\\%$ receptor occupancy is expected to elicit a very strong, likely near-maximal, macroscopic response.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the derivation of the single-channel current and its numerical evaluation. This is a two-step process: first, calculating the channel's reversal potential, and second, using this potential to calculate the current.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Current Expression and Calculation of the Reversal Potential**\n\nStarting from first principles, the current ($i$) flowing through an ohmic conductor is proportional to the potential difference across it. For an ion channel, the conductor is the channel pore, its conductance is $g$, and the potential difference is the electrochemical driving force. The driving force is the difference between the membrane potential, $V_m$, and the ion's equilibrium or reversal potential, $E_{rev}$. The relationship is a form of Ohm's law:\n$$i = g (V_m - E_{rev})$$\nIn this equation, the sign of the current $i$ is conventionally defined such that a positive value represents an outward flow of positive charge (outward current), and a negative value represents an inward flow of positive charge (inward current).\n\nThe problem states that the channel's reversal potential, $E_{rev}$, is equal to the Nernst potential for chloride ions, $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$. The Nernst potential is the membrane potential at which the net flow of an ion is zero, meaning the electrical and chemical gradients are in balance. It is given by the Nernst equation:\n$$E_{ion} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[ion]_{o}}{[ion]_{i}}\\right)$$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $z$ is the valence of the ion, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $[ion]_{o}$ and $[ion]_{i}$ are the extracellular and intracellular concentrations (approximated as activities) of the ion, respectively.\n\nFor chloride ions ($\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$), the valence is $z=-1$. Substituting the given parameters:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = \\frac{RT}{(-1)F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{o}}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{i}}\\right) = -\\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{120 \\ \\mathrm{mM}}{12 \\ \\mathrm{mM}}\\right)$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = -\\frac{RT}{F} \\ln(10)$$\nThe problem provides the value of the thermal voltage term, $RT/F = 26.73 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$ at $T = 310 \\ \\mathrm{K}$, and $\\ln(10) = 2.302585$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = -(26.73 \\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\times (2.302585)$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} \\approx -61.545 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Single-Channel Current**\n\nNow we can calculate the single-channel current, $i$, using the ohmic current expression:\n$$i = g (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{Cl}})$$\nWe substitute the given values for the single-channel conductance, $g = 28 \\ \\mathrm{pS}$, and the membrane potential, $V_m = -50 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$, along with our calculated value for $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$.\n$$i = (28 \\ \\mathrm{pS}) [(-50 \\ \\mathrm{mV}) - (-61.545 \\ \\mathrm{mV})]$$\n$$i = (28 \\ \\mathrm{pS}) (11.545 \\ \\mathrm{mV})$$\nTo evaluate this numerically, we must work with consistent units. Note that $1 \\ \\mathrm{pS} = 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{S}$ and $1 \\ \\mathrm{mV} = 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{V}$. The product gives a current in amperes ($A = S \\cdot V$):\n$$i = (28 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{S}) \\times (11.545 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{V})$$\n$$i = 323.26 \\times 10^{-15} \\ \\mathrm{A}$$\nTo express the answer in picoamperes ($1 \\ \\mathrm{pA} = 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{A}$), we convert the result:\n$$i = 0.32326 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{A} = 0.32326 \\ \\mathrm{pA}$$\n\n**Part 3: Final Sign Interpretation**\n\nThe calculated current is positive ($i > 0$). According to the standard convention for the equation $i = g(V_m - E_{rev})$, a positive current signifies an outward flow of positive charge. Let's verify this physically. The membrane potential ($V_m = -50 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$) is less negative (depolarized) compared to the chloride equilibrium potential ($E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} \\approx -61.5 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$). The chemical gradient, due to $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{o} > [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{i}$, drives $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ into the cell. The electrical gradient, given by the negative $V_m$, drives the negatively charged $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ out of the cell. Since $V_m > E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$, the inward chemical force is stronger than the weakened outward electrical force, resulting in a net **influx** of $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ ions.\n\nAn influx of negative charges ($\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$) is, by definition, an **outward current** of positive charge. The problem's sign convention states that \"inward current (net positive charge entering the cell) is negative.\" This implies that outward current (net positive charge leaving the cell) is positive. Our physically reasoned direction (outward current) and calculated sign (positive) are therefore consistent with the problem's stated convention.\n\nRounding the final value to three significant figures, we get:\n$$i = 0.323 \\ \\mathrm{pA}$$\nThis is the signed single-channel current.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.323}\n$$", "id": "4590699"}]}
