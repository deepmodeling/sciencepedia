We begin with the provided definitions.\n\nThe definition of receptor occupancy is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]}\n$$\nFrom the conservation of receptors, we know that the total receptor concentration $[R_T]$ is the sum of the free receptor concentration $[R]$ and the ligand-bound receptor concentration $[RL]$:\n$$\n[R_T] = [R] + [RL]\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\theta$ gives:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}\n$$\nTo proceed, we must eliminate the term $[R]$.

Calculate the fraction of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane, $T$:**\nMembrane GLUT4 fraction is a saturable function of Akt activity with half-maximal parameter $K_T=0.3$.\nFor the baseline case:\n$$T_{\\text{baseline}} = \\dfrac{A_{\\text{baseline}}}{K_{T} + A_{\\text{baseline}}} = \\dfrac{\\frac{100}{119.36}}{0.3 + \\frac{100}{119.36}} = \\dfrac{100}{0.3 \\cdot 119.36 + 100} = \\dfrac{100}{35.808 + 100} = \\dfrac{100}{135.808}$$\nFor the inhibited case:\n$$T_{\\text{inhib}} = \\dfrac{A_{\\text{inhib}}}{K_{T} + A_{\\text{inhib}}} = \\dfrac{\\frac{36}{55.36}}{0.3 + \\frac{36}{55.36}} = \\dfrac{36}{0.3 \\cdot 55.36 + 36} = \\dfrac{36}{16.608 + 36} = \\dfrac{36}{52.608}$$\n\n**5. Calculate the fractional reduction, $R$:**\nNow we compute the ratio of the $T$ values and then $R$.\n$$\\dfrac{T_{\\text{inhib}}}{T_{\\text{baseline}}} = \\dfrac{\\frac{36}{52.608}}{\\frac{100}{135.808}} = \\dfrac{36}{52.608} \\cdot \\dfrac{135.808}{100} \\approx (0.6843031)(1.35808) \\approx 0.929344$$\n$$R = 1 - \\dfrac{T_{\\text{inhib}}}{T_{\\text{baseline}}} \\approx 1 - 0.929344 = 0.070656$$\nRounding the final result to four significant figures gives $0.07066$.\nNote on the glucose term: The fact that $[G] = K_m$ means the glucose transport component $\\frac{[G]}{K_m + [G]}$ would be $\\frac{5}{5+5} = \\frac{1}{2}$, but this term cancels and does not affect the final fractional reduction.\nThe derived analytic expression for $R$ in terms of intermediate variables is:\n$$R = 1 - \\left[ \\frac{A_{\\text{inhib}}}{A_{\\text{baseline}}} \\cdot \\frac{K_T + A_{\\text{baseline}}}{K_T + A_{\\text{inhib}}} \\right]$$\nwhere $A_{\\text{baseline}}$ and $A_{\\text{inhib}}$ are functions of the fundamental parameters as derived above. The step-by-step computation fulfills the requirement to derive the solution from first principles.\nFinal calculation check:\n$f_R = 10/11 \\approx 0.90909$\n$r_{p, \\text{baseline}} = 10/11 \\approx 0.90909$\n$r_{p, \\text{inhib}} = 6/11 \\approx 0.54545$\n$A_{\\text{baseline}} = (10/11)^2 / (0.16 + (10/11)^2) = 100/119.36 \\approx 0.83780$\n$A_{\\text{inhib}} = (6/11)^2 / (0.16 + (6/11)^2) = 36/55.36 \\approx 0.65029$\n$T_{\\text{baseline}} = 0.83780 / (0.3 + 0.83780) = 0.83780 / 1.13780 \\approx 0.73633$\n$T_{\\text{inhib}} = 0.65029 / (0.3 + 0.65029) = 0.65029 / 0.95029 \\approx 0.68430$\n$R = 1 - (0.68430 / 0.73633) = 1 - 0.929344 \\approx 0.070656$\nThe rounding to four significant figures yields $0.07066$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.07066}$$", "id": "4589803"}]}
