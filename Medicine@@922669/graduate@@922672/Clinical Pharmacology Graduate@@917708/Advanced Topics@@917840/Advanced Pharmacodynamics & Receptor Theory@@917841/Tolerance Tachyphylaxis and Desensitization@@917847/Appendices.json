We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the steady-state concentration ($C_{ss}$) from first principles for a drug administered via constant intravenous infusion, following a one-compartment model with first-order elimination. Subsequently, we must compute the new steady-state concentration after a change in the drug's systemic clearance.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the amount of drug in the body, $A(t)$, is the law of mass balance. The rate of change of the amount of drug in the body over time, $\\frac{dA(t)}{dt}$, is equal to the rate at which the drug enters the body minus the rate at which it leaves the body.\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = \\text{Rate In} - \\text{Rate Out}\n$$\nFor a constant intravenous infusion, the rate of drug administration (Rate In) is a constant, denoted as $R_{in}$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate In} = R_{in}\n$$\nThe problem specifies first-order elimination. In this process, the rate of elimination (Rate Out) is directly proportional to the drug's plasma concentration, $C(t)$. The constant of proportionality is the systemic clearance, $CL$. Clearance represents the theoretical volume of plasma from which the drug is completely removed per unit of time.\n$$\n\\text{Rate Out} = CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nSubstituting these terms into the mass balance equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = R_{in} - CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nThe problem defines a one-compartment model, where the drug is assumed to distribute instantaneously and uniformly throughout a single, well-stirred compartment. The concentration $C(t)$ is related to the total amount of drug in the body $A(t)$ through the apparent volume of distribution, $V$:\n$$\nA(t) = V \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nAssuming the volume of distribution $V$ is constant, we can differentiate this relationship with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt}\n$$\nBy equating the two expressions for $\\frac{dA(t)}{dt}$, we can write the mass balance entirely in terms of concentration $C(t)$:\n$$\nV \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = R_{in} - CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nThis is the fundamental differential equation for a one-compartment model with constant infusion and first-order elimination.\n\nSteady state is achieved when the rate of drug administration equals the rate of drug elimination. At this point, the net change in the amount of drug in the body is zero, and consequently, the plasma concentration becomes constant. We denote this steady-state concentration as $C_{ss}$. Mathematically, this condition is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = 0\n$$\nApplying this condition to our differential equation:\n$$\nV \\cdot (0) = R_{in} - CL \\cdot C_{ss}\n$$\n$$\n0 = R_{in} - CL \\cdot C_{ss}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nCL \\cdot C_{ss} = R_{in}\n$$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration, $C_{ss}$, we derive the required general formula:\n$$\nC_{ss} = \\frac{R_{in}}{CL}\n$$\nThis derivation fulfills the first part of the problem. It is noteworthy that the steady-state concentration is determined solely by the infusion rate and the clearance, and is independent of the volume of distribution, $V$.\n\nNow, we compute the new steady-state concentration following the increase in clearance due to hepatic enzyme induction.

A primary mechanism for rapid desensitization is the internalization of surface receptors, temporarily removing them from the site of action.

The recovery process is described as a first-order relaxation to equilibrium.\n\nFirst, we establish the mathematical model for the system. Let $N(t)$ be the number of receptors on the cell surface at time $t$, and let $N_0$ be the steady-state equilibrium count. The process is one of relaxation to equilibrium, which is governed by a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. The rate of change of the surface receptor population, $\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}$, is proportional to the deviation of the current count from the equilibrium value, $N(t) - N_0$.\nThe governing differential equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k(N(t) - N_0) $$\nHere, $k$ is the first-order rate constant for the recycling process. The negative sign indicates that the system moves to reduce the deviation, i.e., it returns towards the equilibrium state $N_0$.\n\nThis is a separable differential equation. Let $y(t) = N(t) - N_0$. Then $\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\frac{dN}{dt}$, and the equation becomes $\\frac{dy}{dt} = -ky$.

Substituting back $y(t) = N(t) - N_0$, we get the general solution for $N(t)$:\n$$ N(t) = N_0 + A \\exp(-kt) $$\nTo find the constant $A$, we use the initial condition provided in the problem. At time $t=0$, after rapid internalization, the surface receptor count is $N(0) = 0.3N_0$.\n$$ N(0) = N_0 + A \\exp(-k \\cdot 0) $$\n$$ 0.3N_0 = N_0 + A $$\n$$ A = 0.3N_0 - N_0 = -0.7N_0 $$\nSubstituting this value of $A$ back into the general solution gives the particular solution for this process:\n$$ N(t) = N_0 - 0.7N_0 \\exp(-kt) $$\n$$ N(t) = N_0 (1 - 0.7 \\exp(-kt)) $$\nThis equation describes the time course of receptor recovery.\n\nNext, we must determine the rate constant $k$. The problem provides the half-life of the recycling process, $t_{1/2} = 2 \\ \\text{hours}$, which is defined for the exponential relaxation of the deviation from equilibrium. The deviation from equilibrium is $\\Delta N(t) = N(t) - N_0 = -0.7N_0 \\exp(-kt)$. The half-life is the time it takes for this deviation to reduce to half its initial magnitude.\nThe initial deviation at $t=0$ is $\\Delta N(0) = N(0) - N_0 = -0.7N_0$.\nAt $t=t_{1/2}$, the deviation is $\\Delta N(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta N(0)$.\n$$ -0.7N_0 \\exp(-k t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} (-0.7N_0) $$\nDividing both sides by $-0.7N_0$ (which is non-zero) yields:\n$$ \\exp(-k t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -k t_{1/2} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2) $$\n$$ k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} $$\n\nNow we have all the components to solve for the recovery time. We need to find the time $t_{rec}$ at which the surface receptor count reaches the functional recovery threshold, i.e., $N(t_{rec}) = 0.95N_0$.\nUsing our particular solution for $N(t)$:\n$$ 0.95N_0 = N_0 (1 - 0.7 \\exp(-kt_{rec})) $$\nDividing by $N_0$:\n$$ 0.95 = 1 - 0.7 \\exp(-kt_{rec}) $$\nRearranging to solve for the exponential term:\n$$ 0.7 \\exp(-kt_{rec}) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\n$$ \\exp(-kt_{rec}) = \\frac{0.05}{0.7} = \\frac{5}{70} = \\frac{1}{14} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -kt_{rec} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{14}\\right) = -\\ln(14) $$\n$$ t_{rec} = \\frac{\\ln(14)}{k} $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for the rate constant $k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$:\n$$ t_{rec} = \\frac{\\ln(14)}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}} = t_{1/2} \\frac{\\ln(14)}{\\ln(2)} $$\nGiven $t_{1/2} = 2 \\ \\text{hours}$, we can calculate the numerical value for the recovery time:\n$$ t_{rec} = 2 \\frac{\\ln(14)}{\\ln(2)} $$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(ab) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$, we can write $\\ln(14) = \\ln(2 \\times 7) = \\ln(2) + \\ln(7)$.\n$$ t_{rec} = 2 \\frac{\\ln(2) + \\ln(7)}{\\ln(2)} = 2 \\left(1 + \\frac{\\ln(7)}{\\ln(2)}\\right) $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ t_{rec} \\approx 2 \\times \\frac{2.639057}{0.693147} \\approx 2 \\times 3.807355 \\approx 7.61471 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ t_{rec} \\approx 7.615 $$\nThus, the time to reach $95\\%$ functional recovery is approximately $7.615$ hours.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.615}$$", "id": "4599628"}, {"introduction": "The cellular adaptations underlying tolerance can have profound clinical consequences, especially upon drug discontinuation.
