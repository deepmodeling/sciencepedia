The concept of \"spare receptors\" (or receptor reserve) describes a common physiological phenomenon where the maximal biological response ($E_{max}$) of a tissue or cell to an agonist is achieved when only a fraction of the total available receptors is occupied. The receptors that are not required for the maximal response are considered \"spare\".\n\nOur calculation shows a fractional occupancy of $\\theta \\approx 0.1667$. If the biological system in question exhibits a maximal response at this level of occupancy (or an even lower one), it demonstrates the existence of a significant receptor reserve. This situation has a critical implication for the sensitivity of the system to the ligand. The presence of spare receptors allows the concentration-response curve to be shifted to the left of the concentration-binding curve. This means the concentration of ligand required to produce $50\\%$ of the maximal effect ($EC_{50}$) is lower than the concentration required to occupy $50\\%$ of the receptors (the $K_D$). In this problem, the applied ligand concentration ($[A] = 20\\,\\mathrm{nM}$) is only one-fifth of the $K_D$ ($100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$), yet it could elicit a substantial, or even maximal, response in a system with a large receptor reserve. This demonstrates enhanced sensitivity, as the system can react robustly to ligand concentrations that are well below the dissociation constant. In essence, spare receptors provide a mechanism for signal amplification, enabling a strong physiological output from a relatively weak input signal (i.e., low ligand concentration).", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.1667} $$", "id": "4592826"}, {"introduction": "The concept of spare receptors requires a quantitative framework to be useful in drug development and clinical practice.

A value greater than $1$ indicates a decrease in potency (since a higher concentration is needed).\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{EC_{50, \\text{new}}}{EC_{50, \\text{old}}} = \\frac{\\frac{K_A}{\\frac{\\tau_{\\text{old}}}{2}+1}}{\\frac{K_A}{\\tau_{\\text{old}}+1}} = \\frac{\\tau_{\\text{old}}+1}{\\frac{\\tau_{\\text{old}}}{2}+1}$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\tau_{\\text{old}}+1}{\\frac{\\tau_{\\text{old}}+2}{2}} = \\frac{2(\\tau_{\\text{old}}+1)}{\\tau_{\\text{old}}+2}$$\nWe now apply this formula for the three given initial values of $\\tau$: $\\tau \\in \\{0.5, 1, 5\\}$.\n\nFor $\\tau_{\\text{old}} = 0.5$:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{2(0.5+1)}{0.5+2} = \\frac{2(1.5)}{2.5} = \\frac{3}{2.5} = \\frac{30}{25} = \\frac{6}{5}$$\n\nFor $\\tau_{\\text{old}} = 1$:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{2(1+1)}{1+2} = \\frac{2(2)}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\n\nFor $\\tau_{\\text{old}} = 5$:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{2(5+1)}{5+2} = \\frac{2(6)}{7} = \\frac{12}{7}$$\n\n**Part 3: Explanation of Nonlinearity, Spare Receptors, and Sensitivity**\n\nThe relationship between potency and receptor number is nonlinear, as evidenced by the fold-change formula, $\\frac{2(\\tau+1)}{\\tau+2}$, which is not a linear function of $\\tau$. This nonlinearity is fundamental to the concept of **spare receptors** (or receptor reserve) and **receptor sensitivity**.\n\nThe term \"spare receptors\" describes a situation where a maximal or near-maximal physiological response can be elicited by an agonist at a concentration where not all available receptors are occupied. In the operational model, a large value of $\\tau$ signifies a large receptor reserve. Conversely, a small $\\tau$ indicates little to no receptor reserve. The expression $EC_{50} = \\frac{K_A}{\\tau+1}$ quantifies this:\n- When $\\tau$ is large (large reserve), $EC_{50}$ is much smaller than $K_A$. The agonist is highly potent, requiring only a low concentration (and thus low fractional receptor occupancy) to achieve $50\\%$ of its effect.\n- When $\\tau$ is small (low reserve, e.g., $\\tau \\to 0$), $EC_{50}$ approaches $K_A$. Potency is low, and the dose-response curve more closely reflects the receptor-binding curve.\n\nReceptor sensitivity, in this context, refers to how significantly the agonist's potency is affected by a change in receptor density ($R_T$, which determines $\\tau$). Our calculated fold-changes demonstrate this sensitivity.\n\n- **High $\\tau$ (e.g., $\\tau=5$):** The system has a large receptor reserve. The fold-change in $EC_{50}$ is $\\frac{12}{7} \\approx 1.71$. Halving the number of receptors causes a substantial ($71\\%$) increase in $EC_{50}$, meaning a significant drop in potency. The system is highly sensitive to the loss of receptors because its high initial potency was directly dependent on the large \"buffer\" provided by the spare receptors. Losing half of this buffer forces the system to require a much higher agonist concentration to generate the same stimulus. In the limit as $\\tau \\to \\infty$, the fold-change approaches $\\lim_{\\tau \\to \\infty} \\frac{2\\tau+2}{\\tau+2} = 2$, meaning halving the receptors nearly doubles the $EC_{50}$.\n\n- **Low $\\tau$ (e.g., $\\tau=0.5$):** The system has little or no receptor reserve. The fold-change in $EC_{50}$ is $\\frac{6}{5} = 1.2$. Halving the already scarce receptors causes only a modest ($20\\%$) increase in $EC_{50}$. The system is less sensitive to receptor loss in relative terms. Its potency was already low and closely tied to receptor occupancy; reducing the number of receptors makes an inefficient system even more so, but the relative impact on potency is smaller than in a high-reserve system.\n\nIn conclusion, the effect of altering receptor density on agonist potency is nonlinear because of the amplification between receptor occupancy and response. This amplification, quantified by $\\tau$, creates the phenomenon of spare receptors. Systems with a large receptor reserve are more sensitive to receptor downregulation, exhibiting a larger drop in potency for the same fractional loss of receptors compared to systems with no reserve.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{6}{5}  \\frac{4}{3}  \\frac{12}{7} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4592784"}]}
