This constant arises from the law of mass action, where the ratio of the product of reactant concentrations to the product concentration is constant.\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]} $$\nHere, $[R]$, $[L]$, and $[RL]$ represent the molar concentrations of the free receptor, free ligand, and receptor-ligand complex at equilibrium, respectively.\n\nFractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of the total receptor population that is bound by the ligand. The total concentration of receptors, $[R_{tot}]$, is the sum of the concentrations of free receptors, $[R]$, and bound receptors, $[RL]$.\n$$ [R_{tot}] = [R] + [RL] $$\nTherefore, the expression for $\\theta$ is:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{\\text{Concentration of bound receptors}}{\\text{Total concentration of receptors}} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_{tot}]} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]} $$\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_d$, we must eliminate $[R]$ and $[RL]$ from the equation for $\\theta$ where possible. We can rearrange the definition of $K_d$ to solve for $[R]$:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the denominator of the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\left(\\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}\\right) + [RL]} $$\nThe term $[RL]$ is common to the numerator and both terms in the denominator's sum. It can be factored out from the denominator and cancelled:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL] \\left(\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1} $$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[L]$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1 \\cdot [L]}{\\left(\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1\\right) \\cdot [L]} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]} $$\nThis is the required expression for fractional occupancy $\\theta$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_d$. This functional form is known as the Hill-Langmuir equation for a system with a Hill coefficient of $1$.\n\n### Evaluation of $\\theta$ at Specific Ligand Concentrations\n\nWe are given $K_d = 5\\,\\text{nM}$.

Only a small fraction of receptors are occupied ($\\theta = 1/6$). In this sub-saturating range, receptor occupancy is highly sensitive to changes in ligand concentration. The relationship is nearly linear ($\\theta \\approx [L]/K_d$). This implies that in a therapeutic context, a drug dosed in this range will produce an effect that is strongly dependent on its concentration, and small fluctuations in drug levels can lead to significant changes in target engagement.\n\n-   **At $[L] = 5\\,\\text{nM}$ ($[L] = K_d$):** By definition, the $K_d$ is the ligand concentration at which exactly half of the receptors are occupied ($\\theta = 1/2$). This is a fundamental parameter of drug affinity; a lower $K_d$ signifies higher affinity, as a lower concentration is needed to occupy $50\\%$ of the target. This concentration often falls on the steepest part of the occupancy curve, where target engagement is responsive to changes in drug concentration but is beginning to show diminishing returns.\n\n-   **At $[L] = 50\\,\\text{nM}$ ($[L] > K_d$):** The ligand concentration is an order of magnitude greater than the $K_d$. The receptors are approaching saturation, with a high fractional occupancy ($\\theta = 10/11 \\approx 91\\%$). In this near-saturating regime, further increases in ligand concentration yield progressively smaller increases in receptor occupancy. Pharmacologically, this means that once a drug is dosed to a concentration several-fold higher than its $K_d$, maximal target engagement is nearly achieved.
