The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in principles of pharmacokinetics and renal physiology, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is stated objectively.\n\nThe derivation begins from the fundamental definition of clearance ($\\text{CL}$), which is the volume of plasma cleared of a substance per unit time. For a specific elimination process, it is defined as the rate of elimination by that process divided by the total plasma concentration of the drug ($C_p$).\n$$\n\\text{CL} = \\frac{\\text{Rate of Elimination}}{C_p}\n$$\nIn this case, the drug is eliminated *only* by glomerular filtration. Therefore, the rate of elimination is the rate of filtration. We denote the filtration clearance as $\\text{CL}_{\\text{filtration}}$.\n$$\n\\text{CL}_{\\text{filtration}} = \\frac{\\text{Rate of Filtration}}{C_p}\n$$\nThe rate of filtration is the mass of drug entering Bowman's space per unit time. This is the product of the drug's concentration in the glomerular filtrate ($C_{\\text{filtrate}}$) and the volume of filtrate formed per unit time, which is the glomerular filtration rate ($\\text{GFR}$). The GFR is given as $100\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Filtration} = C_{\\text{filtrate}} \\times \\text{GFR}\n$$\nTo proceed, we must express $C_{\\text{filtrate}}$ in terms of $C_p$. The problem provides two core definitions for this purpose. First, the glomerular sieving coefficient, $\\theta=0.90$, relates the filtrate concentration to the unbound plasma concentration ($C_u$):\n$$\nC_{\\text{filtrate}} = \\theta\\,C_u\n$$\nSecond, the fraction unbound in plasma, $f_u=0.20$, relates the unbound plasma concentration to the total plasma concentration ($C_p$):\n$$\nC_u = f_u\\,C_p\n$$\nBy substituting the second equation into the first, we can relate $C_{\\text{filtrate}}$ directly to $C_p$:\n$$\nC_{\\text{filtrate}} = \\theta\\,(f_u\\,C_p) = \\theta\\,f_u\\,C_p\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $C_{\\text{filtrate}}$ into the equation for the rate of filtration:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Filtration} = (\\theta\\,f_u\\,C_p) \\times \\text{GFR}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this rate of filtration back into the definition of filtration clearance:\n$$\n\\text{CL}_{\\text{filtration}} = \\frac{\\theta\\,f_u\\,C_p\\,\\text{GFR}}{C_p}\n$$\nThe total plasma concentration term, $C_p$, cancels from the numerator and denominator. This yields the derived expression for filtration clearance:\n$$\n\\text{CL}_{\\text{filtration}} = \\theta\\,f_u\\,\\text{GFR}\n$$\nThis expression demonstrates that filtration clearance is determined by the interplay of three factors: the intrinsic filtration capacity of the kidneys ($\\text{GFR}$), the extent of drug binding to plasma proteins ($f_u$), and the degree of hindrance the drug encounters at the glomerular filtration barrier ($\\theta$).\n\nTo compute the numerical value, we substitute the given parameters into this derived expression:\n- $\\text{GFR} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$\n- $f_u = 0.20$\n- $\\theta = 0.90$\n$$\n\\text{CL}_{\\text{filtration}} = (0.90) \\times (0.20) \\times (100\\,\\mathrm{mL/min})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{CL}_{\\text{filtration}} = 0.18 \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{CL}_{\\text{filtration}} = 18\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Thus, the value is $18.0\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n\nFor the interpretation, we consider the hypothetical case where size and charge do not hinder filtration. In this scenario, the drug would be \"freely filtered,\" meaning its concentration in the filtrate would be equal to the unbound concentration in plasma. This corresponds to a sieving coefficient $\\theta = 1$. The clearance for this ideal case would be:\n$$\n\\text{CL}_{\\text{ideal}} = (1) \\times f_u \\times \\text{GFR} = f_u\\,\\text{GFR}\n$$\nThis quantity, $f_u\\,\\text{GFR}$, represents the clearance of the unbound drug and is the theoretical maximum clearance achievable by filtration alone for a given level of plasma protein binding. For the drug in this problem, the ideal filtration clearance would be:\n$$\n\\text{CL}_{\\text{ideal}} = 0.20 \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{mL/min} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}\n$$\nThe actual calculated filtration clearance is $18.0\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$. The sieving coefficient $\\theta = 0.90$ signifies a $10\\%$ reduction in filtration efficiency compared to a freely filtered substance. This means the glomerular barrier imposes a slight restriction on the drug's passage, causing the actual clearance ($18.0\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$) to be $90\\%$ of the maximum possible filtration clearance for this drug ($20\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$).
