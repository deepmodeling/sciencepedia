The scenario of parallel metabolic pathways (sulfation and glucuronidation) for xenobiotic clearance is a standard, well-documented phenomenon. The given $K_m$ values are plausible for different enzyme families acting on a common substrate. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary parameters ($K_m$ values, the relationship between $V_{\\max}$ values) and specifies a clear, single quantitative goal. It is well-posed and a unique solution exists.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. I will now proceed to derive the solution.\n\nThe rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, $v$, is described by the Michaelis–Menten equation:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max} S}{K_m + S}$$\nwhere $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum reaction velocity, $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant, and $S$ is the substrate concentration.\n\nFor the two independent pathways, the individual rates are:\nRate of sulfation:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{SULT}} = \\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{SULT}} S}{K_{m,\\mathrm{SULT}} + S}$$\nRate of glucuronidation:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{UGT}} = \\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{UGT}} S}{K_{m,\\mathrm{UGT}} + S}$$\n\nThe total metabolic rate, $v_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is the sum of the rates of the independent pathways:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{total}} = v_{\\mathrm{SULT}} + v_{\\mathrm{UGT}}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the maximum velocities are identical, so we can set $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{SULT}} = V_{\\max,\\mathrm{UGT}} = V_{\\max}$. Substituting this into the total rate equation gives:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{V_{\\max} S}{K_{m,\\mathrm{SULT}} + S} + \\frac{V_{\\max} S}{K_{m,\\mathrm{UGT}} + S}$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{total}} = V_{\\max} S \\left( \\frac{1}{K_{m,\\mathrm{SULT}} + S} + \\frac{1}{K_{m,\\mathrm{UGT}} + S} \\right)$$\n\nThe fractional contribution of the UGT pathway, $f_{\\mathrm{UGT}}(S)$, is the ratio of the UGT rate to the total rate:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{UGT}}(S) = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{UGT}}}{v_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{UGT}}}{v_{\\mathrm{SULT}} + v_{\\mathrm{UGT}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the rates:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{UGT}}(S) = \\frac{\\frac{V_{\\max} S}{K_{m,\\mathrm{UGT}} + S}}{\\frac{V_{\\max} S}{K_{m,\\mathrm{SULT}} + S} + \\frac{V_{\\max} S}{K_{m,\\mathrm{UGT}} + S}}$$\n\nThe term $V_{\\max} S$ is common to all terms and can be canceled from the numerator and denominator (for $S > 0$):\n$$f_{\\mathrm{UGT}}(S) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{K_{m,\\mathrm{UGT}} + S}}{\\frac{1}{K_{m,\\mathrm{SULT}} + S} + \\frac{1}{K_{m,\\mathrm{UGT}} + S}}$$\n\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $(K_{m,\\mathrm{SULT}} + S)(K_{m,\\mathrm{UGT}} + S)$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{UGT}}(S) = \\frac{(K_{m,\\mathrm{SULT}} + S)}{(K_{m,\\mathrm{UGT}} + S) + (K_{m,\\mathrm{SULT}} + S)}$$\nThis simplifies to the general formula for the fractional contribution of the UGT pathway:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{UGT}}(S) = \\frac{K_{m,\\mathrm{SULT}} + S}{K_{m,\\mathrm{SULT}} + K_{m,\\mathrm{UGT}} + 2S}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this function at the specified substrate concentrations using the given constants $K_{m,\\mathrm{SULT}} = 0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $K_{m,\\mathrm{UGT}} = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. The units ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) are consistent and will cancel, so we can use the numerical values directly.\n\nAt $S = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{UGT}}(1) = \\frac{0.5 + 1}{0.5 + 50 + 2(1)} = \\frac{1.5}{50.5 + 2} = \\frac{1.5}{52.5}$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{UGT}}(1) = \\frac{15}{525} = \\frac{1}{35}$$\n\nAt $S = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{UGT}}(100) = \\frac{0.5 + 100}{0.5 + 50 + 2(100)} = \\frac{100.5}{50.5 + 200} = \\frac{100.5}{250.5}$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{UGT}}(100) = \\frac{1005}{2505} = \\frac{201}{501} = \\frac{67}{167}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the increase in the fractional contribution of UGT, which is the difference between these two values:\n$$\\text{Increase} = f_{\\mathrm{UGT}}(100) - f_{\\mathrm{UGT}}(1) = \\frac{67}{167} - \\frac{1}{35}$$\nTo subtract these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $167 \\times 35 = 5845$:\n$$\\text{Increase} = \\frac{67 \\times 35}{167 \\times 35} - \\frac{1 \\times 167}{35 \\times 167} = \\frac{2345 - 167}{5845} = \\frac{2178}{5845}$$\n\nNow, we convert this fraction to a decimal:\n$$\\text{Increase} = \\frac{2178}{5845} \\approx 0.3726261762...$$\n\nRounding this result to four significant figures, we get $0.3726$.\n\nThis result demonstrates a key principle in pharmacokinetics: when multiple enzymes with different affinities ($K_m$ values) compete for the same substrate, the contribution of the high-$K_m$ (low-affinity) pathway becomes increasingly significant as the substrate concentration rises and begins to saturate the low-$K_m$ (high-affinity) pathway. At low concentrations ($S=1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$), SULT dominates, while at high concentrations ($S=100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$), UGT's contribution rises substantially.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3726}$$", "id": "4557542"}, {"introduction": "A critical task in clinical pharmacology is to predict a drug's clearance in humans from preclinical laboratory data.

It is a well-defined exercise in applying standard pharmacokinetic principles. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe calculation will proceed in four sequential steps as outlined by the problem structure:\n1.  Determine the in vitro unbound intrinsic clearance from the microsomal kinetic data.\n2.  Scale the in vitro intrinsic clearance to an in vivo value for the whole liver.\n3.  Calculate the fraction of unbound drug in the blood.\n4.  Compute the hepatic blood clearance using the well-stirred model.\n\n#### Step 2.1: In Vitro Unbound Intrinsic Clearance ($CL_{int, u, \\text{mic}}$)\nThe intrinsic clearance ($CL_{int}$) is defined as the ratio of the velocity of the reaction ($v$) to the substrate concentration ($C$) at concentrations well below the Michaelis constant ($K_m$). The problem specifies that kinetics should be based on unbound concentrations ($C_u$), so the unbound intrinsic clearance is $CL_{int,u} = v/C_u$ as $C_u \\rightarrow 0$.\n\nThe Michaelis-Menten equation based on unbound drug concentration is:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{max} \\cdot C_u}{K_{m,u} + C_u}$$\nwhere $K_{m,u}$ is the Michaelis constant for the unbound substrate.\nAt very low concentrations ($C_u \\ll K_{m,u}$), this simplifies to:\n$$v \\approx \\frac{V_{max}}{K_{m,u}} \\cdot C_u$$\nTherefore, the unbound intrinsic clearance is defined as:\n$$CL_{int,u} = \\frac{V_{max}}{K_{m,u}}$$\nThe problem states that the given $K_m$ value was determined using total drug concentrations ($C_{total}$), where $C_u = f_{u,inc} \\cdot C_{total}$. The experimental data were likely fitted to the form $v = \\frac{V_{max} \\cdot C_{total}}{K_m + C_{total}}$. By substituting $C_u$ in the original equation, we can find the relationship between the true unbound constant $K_{m,u}$ and the measured apparent constant $K_m$:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{max} \\cdot (f_{u,inc} \\cdot C_{total})}{K_{m,u} + (f_{u,inc} \\cdot C_{total})} = \\frac{V_{max} \\cdot C_{total}}{\\frac{K_{m,u}}{f_{u,inc}} + C_{total}}$$\nBy comparing this to the form used for fitting, we deduce that the measured $K_m$ is an apparent value equal to $K_{m,u} / f_{u,inc}$. Thus, $K_{m,u} = K_m \\cdot f_{u,inc}$.\n\nThe unbound intrinsic clearance per milligram of microsomal protein, $CL_{int, u, \\text{mic}}$, is:\n$$CL_{int, u, \\text{mic}} = \\frac{V_{max}}{K_m \\cdot f_{u,inc}}$$\nFirst, we must ensure consistent units.\n$V_{max} = 0.50$ nmol/min/mg microsomal protein.\n$K_m = 250$ $\\mu$M $= 250$ $\\mu$mol/L $= 250$ nmol/mL.\n$f_{u,inc} = 0.80$ (dimensionless).\n\nSubstituting the values:\n$$CL_{int, u, \\text{mic}} = \\frac{0.50 \\; \\text{nmol/min/mg}}{250 \\; \\text{nmol/mL} \\times 0.80} = \\frac{0.50}{200} \\; \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min} \\cdot \\text{mg}} = 0.0025 \\; \\text{mL/min/mg}$$\n\n#### Step 2.2: Scaling to Whole Liver Intrinsic Clearance ($CL_{int}$)\nThe next step is to scale the microsomal clearance to the intrinsic clearance of the entire liver, normalized per kilogram of body weight. This is achieved using the provided scaling factors: microsomal protein per gram of liver (MPPGL) and liver weight per kilogram of body weight.\n$$CL_{int} = CL_{int, u, \\text{mic}} \\times \\text{MPPGL} \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{Liver Weight}}{\\text{Body Weight}}\\right)$$\nThe units are: $(\\text{mL/min/mg}) \\times (\\text{mg/g}) \\times (\\text{g/kg}) \\rightarrow \\text{mL/min/kg}$.\nGiven values:\nMPPGL $= 40$ mg/g liver.\nLiver weight/Body weight $= 21$ g liver/kg body weight.\n\nSubstituting the values:\n$$CL_{int} = 0.0025 \\; \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min} \\cdot \\text{mg}} \\times 40 \\; \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{g}} \\times 21 \\; \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{kg}} = 2.1 \\; \\text{mL/min/kg}$$\nThis $CL_{int}$ represents the total unbound intrinsic clearance of the liver, normalized to body weight.\n\n#### Step 2.3: Unbound Fraction in Blood ($f_{u,b}$)\nThe fraction of unbound drug in blood, $f_{u,b}$, can be calculated from the fraction unbound in plasma, $f_{u,p}$, and the blood-to-plasma concentration ratio, $R_b$. The relationship is derived from the definitions $C_b = R_b C_p$, $f_{u,p} = C_{u,p}/C_p$, and $f_{u,b} = C_{u,b}/C_b$, assuming that the unbound concentration in plasma water is equal to the unbound concentration in blood water ($C_{u,p} = C_{u,b}$).\n$$f_{u,b} = \\frac{C_{u,b}}{C_b} = \\frac{C_{u,p}}{R_b C_p} = \\frac{1}{R_b} \\left(\\frac{C_{u,p}}{C_p}\\right) = \\frac{f_{u,p}}{R_b}$$\nGiven values:\n$f_{u,p} = 0.45$.\n$R_b = 0.95$.\n$$f_{u,b} = \\frac{0.45}{0.95}$$\n\n#### Step 2.4: Hepatic Blood Clearance ($CL_h$)\nFinally, we use the well-stirred liver model formula with the calculated parameters. All terms are in consistent units of mL/min/kg or are dimensionless.\n$$CL_h = \\frac{Q_h \\cdot f_{u,b} \\cdot CL_{int}}{Q_h + f_{u,b} \\cdot CL_{int}}$$\nThe term $f_{u,b} \\cdot CL_{int}$ represents the intrinsic clearance of drug from blood.\n$$f_{u,b} \\cdot CL_{int} = \\frac{0.45}{0.95} \\times 2.1 \\; \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min} \\cdot \\text{kg}} \\approx 0.47368 \\times 2.1 \\; \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min} \\cdot \\text{kg}} \\approx 0.99474 \\; \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min} \\cdot \\text{kg}}$$\nNow, substitute this and $Q_h = 20$ mL/min/kg into the well-stirred model equation:\n$$CL_h = \\frac{20 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{0.45}{0.95} \\times 2.1\\right)}{20 + \\left(\\frac{0.45}{0.95} \\times 2.1\\right)} \\; \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min} \\cdot \\text{kg}}$$\n$$CL_h = \\frac{20 \\cdot (0.99474...)}{20 + 0.99474...} \\; \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min} \\cdot \\text{kg}} = \\frac{19.8947...}{20.9947...} \\; \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min} \\cdot \\text{kg}} \\approx 0.947604 \\; \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min} \\cdot \\text{kg}}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$CL_h \\approx 0.948 \\; \\text{mL/min/kg}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.948}$$", "id": "4557552"}, {"introduction": "Genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes are a primary cause of variability in patient response to medications.

Assuming the same dose $D$ is administered in both cases, this ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{AUC}_{*28/*28}}{\\text{AUC}_{*1/*1}} = \\frac{D/CL_{h,*28/*28}}{D/CL_{h,*1/*1}} = \\frac{CL_{h,*1/*1}}{CL_{h,*28/*28}} $$\nThis demonstrates that the fold-change in AUC is inversely proportional to the fold-change in hepatic clearance.\n\nTo calculate the hepatic clearance for each genotype, we use the well-stirred model of hepatic clearance, which relates $CL_h$ to hepatic blood flow ($Q_h$), the fraction of drug unbound in blood ($f_{u,b}$), and the intrinsic clearance of the drug ($CL_{int}$):\n$$ CL_h = \\frac{Q_h \\cdot f_{u,b} \\cdot CL_{int}}{Q_h + f_{u,b} \\cdot CL_{int}} $$\nWe are given the following values:\n$Q_h = 1500\\,\\text{mL/min}$\n$f_{u,b} = 0.10$\n$CL_{int,*1/*1} = 300\\,\\text{mL/min}$\n$CL_{int,*28/*28} = 75\\,\\text{mL/min}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the term $f_{u,b} \\cdot CL_{int}$, which represents the intrinsic clearance of unbound drug, for each genotype.\nFor the $*1/*1$ genotype:\n$$ f_{u,b} \\cdot CL_{int,*1/*1} = 0.10 \\times 300\\,\\text{mL/min} = 30\\,\\text{mL/min} $$\nFor the $*28/*28$ genotype:\n$$ f_{u,b} \\cdot CL_{int,*28/*28} = 0.10 \\times 75\\,\\text{mL/min} = 7.5\\,\\text{mL/min} $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the hepatic clearance $CL_h$ for each genotype using the well-stirred model formula.\nFor the $*1/*1$ genotype:\n$$ CL_{h,*1/*1} = \\frac{Q_h \\cdot (f_{u,b} \\cdot CL_{int,*1/*1})}{Q_h + (f_{u,b} \\cdot CL_{int,*1/*1})} = \\frac{1500 \\cdot 30}{1500 + 30} = \\frac{45000}{1530}\\,\\text{mL/min} $$\nFor the $*28/*28$ genotype:\n$$ CL_{h,*28/*28} = \\frac{Q_h \\cdot (f_{u,b} \\cdot CL_{int,*28/*28})}{Q_h + (f_{u,b} \\cdot CL_{int,*28/*28})} = \\frac{1500 \\cdot 7.5}{1500 + 7.5} = \\frac{11250}{1507.5}\\,\\text{mL/min} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the desired ratio of the AUCs, which is the inverse ratio of the clearances:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{AUC}_{*28/*28}}{\\text{AUC}_{*1/*1}} = \\frac{CL_{h,*1/*1}}{CL_{h,*28/*28}} = \\frac{\\frac{45000}{1530}}{\\frac{11250}{1507.5}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\text{AUC}_{*28/*28}}{\\text{AUC}_{*1/*1}} = \\frac{45000}{11250} \\cdot \\frac{1507.5}{1530} = 4 \\cdot \\frac{1507.5}{1530} $$\nPerforming the division:\n$$ \\frac{1507.5}{1530} \\approx 0.9852941... $$\nMultiplying by $4$:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{AUC}_{*28/*28}}{\\text{AUC}_{*1/*1}} = 4 \\times 0.9852941... \\approx 3.9411764... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\frac{\\text{AUC}_{*28/*28}}{\\text{AUC}_{*1/*1}} \\approx 3.941 $$\nThe expected fold-change in AUC for the $*28/*28$ genotype relative to the $*1/*1$ genotype is approximately $3.941$. This indicates a nearly four-fold increase in drug exposure for individuals with the reduced-function UGT1A1 genotype, which is a clinically significant change.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.941}$$", "id": "4557575"}]}
