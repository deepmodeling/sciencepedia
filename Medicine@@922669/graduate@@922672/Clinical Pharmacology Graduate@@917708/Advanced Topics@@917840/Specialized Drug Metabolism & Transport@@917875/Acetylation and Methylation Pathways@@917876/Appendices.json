It is based on the established framework of Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics and its application to pharmacogenetics, specifically concerning NAT2 polymorphism. The data provided are sufficient and the objectives are clearly defined. We can therefore proceed with the derivation and subsequent calculations.\n\nThe initial rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, $v$, is described by the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_{m} + [S]}$$\nwhere $v$ is the reaction velocity, $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum velocity, $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, and $K_{m}$ is the Michaelis constant representing the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of $V_{\\max}$.\n\nThe problem states that the substrate concentration is much lower than the Michaelis constant, a condition expressed as $[S] \\ll K_{m}$. Under this first-order kinetic regime, the term $[S]$ in the denominator becomes negligible compared to $K_{m}$. Therefore, the denominator can be approximated as:\n$$K_{m} + [S] \\approx K_{m}$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the Michaelis-Menten equation yields a simplified expression for the initial velocity:\n$$v \\approx \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_{m}}$$\nThis equation demonstrates that under the condition $[S] \\ll K_{m}$, the reaction velocity is directly proportional to the substrate concentration.\n\nThe problem defines intrinsic clearance, $\\text{CL}_{\\text{int}}$, as the initial rate normalized to the substrate concentration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{int}} = \\frac{v}{[S]}$$\nTo derive the expression for intrinsic clearance in terms of the kinetic parameters $V_{\\max}$ and $K_{m}$, we substitute the simplified expression for $v$ into the definition of $\\text{CL}_{\\text{int}}$:\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{int}} = \\frac{\\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_{m}}}{[S]}$$\nThe substrate concentration $[S]$ cancels out, yielding the fundamental relationship for intrinsic clearance under first-order conditions:\n$$\\text{CL}_{\\text{int}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_{m}}$$\nThis completes the derivation portion of the task.\n\nNext, we must calculate the intrinsic clearance for each of the three NAT2 phenotypes: slow, intermediate, and rapid acetylators.

Specifically, we will convert $\\mu\\text{M}$ to $\\text{nmol}\\ \\text{mL}^{-1}$.\nA concentration of $1\\ \\mu\\text{M}$ is equivalent to $1\\ \\mu\\text{mol}$ per liter.\n$$K_{m} = 40\\ \\mu\\text{M} = 40\\ \\frac{\\mu\\text{mol}}{\\text{L}}$$\nUsing the conversion factors $1\\ \\mu\\text{mol} = 10^3\\ \\text{nmol}$ and $1\\ \\text{L} = 10^3\\ \\text{mL}$:\n$$K_{m} = 40\\ \\frac{\\mu\\text{mol}}{\\text{L}} \\times \\frac{10^3\\ \\text{nmol}}{1\\ \\mu\\text{mol}} \\times \\frac{1\\ \\text{L}}{10^3\\ \\text{mL}} = 40\\ \\frac{\\text{nmol}}{\\text{mL}}$$\nThus, the numerical value of the concentration in $\\mu\\text{M}$ is equal to its value in $\\text{nmol}\\ \\text{mL}^{-1}$.

We use this property to find the conditional moments of $CL$ and $1/CL$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the conditional expectation and second moment of $CL$ for a given genotype $g$:\nThe conditional expectation is:\n$$E[CL|G=g] = \\exp(\\mu_g + \\omega^2/2) = \\exp(\\ln(CL_{\\text{typ}} \\cdot M_g) + \\omega^2/2) = CL_{\\text{typ}} \\cdot M_g \\cdot \\exp(\\omega^2/2)$$\nThe conditional second moment is:\n$$E[CL^2|G=g] = \\exp(2\\mu_g + 4\\omega^2/2) = \\exp(2\\ln(CL_{\\text{typ}} \\cdot M_g) + 2\\omega^2) = (CL_{\\text{typ}} \\cdot M_g)^2 \\cdot \\exp(2\\omega^2)$$\n\nNow, we apply the law of total expectation to find the population mean clearance, $E[CL]$:\n$$E[CL] = E_G[E[CL|G]] = \\sum_{g} p_g E[CL|G=g]$$\n$$E[CL] = \\sum_{g} p_g \\left( CL_{\\text{typ}} \\cdot M_g \\cdot \\exp(\\omega^2/2) \\right) = CL_{\\text{typ}} \\exp(\\omega^2/2) \\sum_{g} p_g M_g$$\nLet $E[M] = \\sum_{g} p_g M_g$. Then, the population mean clearance is:\n$$E[CL] = CL_{\\text{typ}} \\cdot E[M] \\cdot \\exp(\\omega^2/2)$$\n\nTo find the coefficient of variation of clearance, $\\text{CV}_{CL}$, we first need the population variance, $\\text{Var}(CL) = E[CL^2] - (E[CL])^2$. We find the population second moment, $E[CL^2]$, using the law of total expectation:\n$$E[CL^2] = E_G[E[CL^2|G]] = \\sum_{g} p_g E[CL^2|G=g]$$\n$$E[CL^2] = \\sum_{g} p_g \\left( (CL_{\\text{typ}} \\cdot M_g)^2 \\cdot \\exp(2\\omega^2) \\right) = CL_{\\text{typ}}^2 \\exp(2\\omega^2) \\sum_{g} p_g M_g^2$$\nLet $E[M^2] = \\sum_{g} p_g M_g^2$. The population second moment of clearance is:\n$$E[CL^2] = CL_{\\text{typ}}^2 \\cdot E[M^2] \\cdot \\exp(2\\omega^2)$$\nThe population variance of clearance is $\\text{Var}(CL) = E[CL^2] - (E[CL])^2$. The coefficient of variation is $\\text{CV}_{CL} = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(CL)} / E[CL]$, which can be written as:\n$$\\text{CV}_{CL} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E[CL^2]}{(E[CL])^2} - 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{CL_{\\text{typ}}^2 E[M^2] \\exp(2\\omega^2)}{(CL_{\\text{typ}} E[M] \\exp(\\omega^2/2))^2} - 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E[M^2]}{(E[M])^2}\\exp(\\omega^2) - 1}$$\n\nNext, we address the moments of exposure, $AUC = Dose/CL$. We need to find $E[AUC]$ and $\\text{CV}_{AUC}$.\n$$E[AUC] = E[Dose/CL] = Dose \\cdot E[1/CL]$$\nWe calculate $E[1/CL]$ by first finding the conditional expectation $E[CL^{-1}|G=g]$ using the moment formula with $k=-1$:\n$$E[CL^{-1}|G=g] = \\exp(-\\mu_g + (-1)^2\\omega^2/2) = \\exp(-\\ln(CL_{\\text{typ}} \\cdot M_g) + \\omega^2/2) = \\frac{1}{CL_{\\text{typ}} \\cdot M_g} \\exp(\\omega^2/2)$$\nBy the law of total expectation:\n$$E[1/CL] = \\sum_{g} p_g E[CL^{-1}|G=g] = \\frac{\\exp(\\omega^2/2)}{CL_{\\text{typ}}} \\sum_{g} \\frac{p_g}{M_g}$$\nLet $E[1/M] = \\sum_{g} p_g/M_g$. The mean exposure is:\n$$E[AUC] = Dose \\cdot E[1/CL] = \\frac{Dose \\cdot \\exp(\\omega^2/2)}{CL_{\\text{typ}}} \\cdot E[1/M]$$\n\nTo find $\\text{CV}_{AUC}$, we use $\\text{CV}_{AUC} = \\text{CV}_{1/CL} = \\sqrt{E[(1/CL)^2]/(E[1/CL])^2 - 1}$. We need $E[(1/CL)^2] = E[CL^{-2}]$. The conditional moment for $k=-2$ is:\n$$E[CL^{-2}|G=g] = \\exp(-2\\mu_g + (-2)^2\\omega^2/2) = \\exp(-2\\ln(CL_{\\text{typ}} \\cdot M_g) + 2\\omega^2) = \\frac{1}{(CL_{\\text{typ}} \\cdot M_g)^2} \\exp(2\\omega^2)$$\nBy the law of total expectation:\n$$E[CL^{-2}] = \\sum_{g} p_g E[CL^{-2}|G=g] = \\frac{\\exp(2\\omega^2)}{CL_{\\text{typ}}^2} \\sum_{g} \\frac{p_g}{M_g^2}$$\nLet $E[1/M^2] = \\sum_{g} p_g/M_g^2$. Then $E[(1/CL)^2] = \\frac{\\exp(2\\omega^2)}{CL_{\\text{typ}}^2} \\cdot E[1/M^2]$.\nFinally, the coefficient of variation for $AUC$ is:\n$$\\text{CV}_{AUC} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E[(1/CL)^2]}{(E[1/CL])^2} - 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{E[1/M^2]\\exp(2\\omega^2)}{CL_{\\text{typ}}^2}}{\\left(\\frac{E[1/M]\\exp(\\omega^2/2)}{CL_{\\text{typ}}}\\right)^2} - 1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E[1/M^2]}{(E[1/M])^2}\\exp(\\omega^2) - 1}$$\n\nThese derived closed-form expressions allow for the direct computation of the required quantities for each test case.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates population pharmacokinetic parameters based on a genetic covariate model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: typical NAT2 impact\n        {\n            \"CL_typ\": 20.0,\n            \"omega\": 0.25,\n            \"f\": 0.7,\n            \"g_factors\": (0.5, 1.0, 1.6),\n            \"p_factors\": (0.45, 0.40, 0.15),\n            \"Dose\": 300.0\n        },\n        # Case B: boundary case, no acetylation contribution\n        {\n            \"CL_typ\": 20.0,\n            \"omega\": 0.25,\n            \"f\": 0.0,\n            \"g_factors\": (0.5, 1.0, 1.6),\n            \"p_factors\": (0.45, 0.40, 0.15),\n            \"Dose\": 300.0\n        },\n        # Case C: boundary case, all clearance via acetylation; high variability\n        {\n            \"CL_typ\": 15.0,\n            \"omega\": 0.5,\n            \"f\": 1.0,\n            \"g_factors\": (0.4, 1.0, 2.5),\n            \"p_factors\": (0.3333333333, 0.3333333333, 0.3333333333),\n            \"Dose\": 200.0\n        },\n        # Case D: population skewed to rapid acetylators; strong NAT2 effect\n        {\n            \"CL_typ\": 25.0,\n            \"omega\": 0.35,\n            \"f\": 0.8,\n            \"g_factors\": (0.6, 1.0, 1.8),\n            \"p_factors\": (0.05, 0.25, 0.70),\n            \"Dose\": 300.0\n        },\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        CL_typ = case[\"CL_typ\"]\n        omega = case[\"omega\"]\n        f = case[\"f\"]\n        g_factors = np.array(case[\"g_factors\"])\n        p_factors = np.array(case[\"p_factors\"])\n        Dose = case[\"Dose\"]\n        \n        # 1.
