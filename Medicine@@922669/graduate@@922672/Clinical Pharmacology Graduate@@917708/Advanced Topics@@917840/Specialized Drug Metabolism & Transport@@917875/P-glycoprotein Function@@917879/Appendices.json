The dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[D][P]}{[DP]}$$\nwhere $[D]$ is the concentration of free drug ($C_u$), $[P]$ is the concentration of unbound protein binding sites ($P_u$), and $[DP]$ is the concentration of the drug-protein complex ($C_b$).\nThus, we can write:\n$$K_d = \\frac{C_u P_u}{C_b}$$\n\nThe total concentration of protein binding sites, $P_T$, is the sum of the unbound sites, $P_u$, and the bound sites, $C_b$:\n$$P_T = P_u + C_b$$\nFrom this, we can express the concentration of unbound sites as $P_u = P_T - C_b$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $P_u$ into the equation for $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{C_u (P_T - C_b)}{C_b}$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $C_b$ in terms of $C_u$, $P_T$, and $K_d$:\n$$K_d C_b = C_u P_T - C_u C_b$$\n$$K_d C_b + C_u C_b = C_u P_T$$\n$$C_b (K_d + C_u) = C_u P_T$$\n$$C_b = \\frac{P_T C_u}{K_d + C_u}$$\nThis is the one-site saturable binding isotherm equation.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $C_b$ into the equation for the total drug concentration, $C_T$:\n$$C_T = C_u + \\frac{P_T C_u}{K_d + C_u}$$\n\nTo solve for $C_u$, we rearrange this equation into a standard quadratic form, $a x^2 + b x + c = 0$.\nMultiply all terms by $(K_d + C_u)$:\n$$C_T (K_d + C_u) = C_u (K_d + C_u) + P_T C_u$$\n$$C_T K_d + C_T C_u = K_d C_u + C_u^2 + P_T C_u$$\nRearranging the terms to one side gives the quadratic equation for $C_u$:\n$$C_u^2 + (K_d + P_T - C_T)C_u - C_T K_d = 0$$\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, $C_u = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b = (K_d + P_T - C_T)$, and $c = -C_T K_d$:\n$$C_u = \\frac{-(K_d + P_T - C_T) \\pm \\sqrt{(K_d + P_T - C_T)^2 - 4(1)(-C_T K_d)}}{2}$$\n$$C_u = \\frac{-(K_d + P_T - C_T) \\pm \\sqrt{(K_d + P_T - C_T)^2 + 4C_T K_d}}{2}$$\nSince concentration must be a non-negative value, we take the positive root. The term under the square root is strictly greater than $(K_d + P_T - C_T)^2$, so its square root is greater than $|K_d + P_T - C_T|$. Therefore, the positive sign must be chosen to ensure $C_u > 0$.\n$$C_u = \\frac{-(K_d + P_T - C_T) + \\sqrt{(K_d + P_T - C_T)^2 + 4C_T K_d}}{2}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $C_T = 5.275 \\, \\mu M$, $P_T = 100.275 \\, \\mu M$, and $K_d = 10.0 \\, \\mu M$.\nFirst, calculate the coefficient of the linear term, $b$:\n$$b = K_d + P_T - C_T = 10.0 + 100.275 - 5.275 = 105.0 \\, \\mu M$$\nNext, calculate the term $4C_T K_d$:\n$$4C_T K_d = 4 \\times 5.275 \\times 10.0 = 211.0 \\, (\\mu M)^2$$\nNow, substitute these into the solution for $C_u$:\n$$C_u = \\frac{-105.0 + \\sqrt{(105.0)^2 + 211.0}}{2}$$\n$$C_u = \\frac{-105.0 + \\sqrt{11025 + 211.0}}{2}$$\n$$C_u = \\frac{-105.0 + \\sqrt{11236}}{2}$$\n$$C_u = \\frac{-105.0 + 106.0}{2}$$\n$$C_u = \\frac{1.0}{2} = 0.50 \\, \\mu M$$\n\n**Stage 2: Calculation of the P-gp Efflux Rate ($v$)**\n\nThe instantaneous P-gp efflux rate, $v$, is given by the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$v = V_{\\max} \\frac{C_u}{K_m + C_u}$$\n\nWe use the calculated value $C_u = 0.50 \\, \\mu M$ and the given parameters $V_{\\max} = 1.8 \\, \\mathrm{pmol \\, min^{-1} \\, mg^{-1}}$ and $K_m = 2.0 \\, \\mu M$.\n$$v = (1.8 \\, \\mathrm{pmol \\, min^{-1} \\, mg^{-1}}) \\times \\frac{0.50 \\, \\mu M}{2.0 \\, \\mu M + 0.50 \\, \\mu M}$$\n$$v = 1.8 \\times \\frac{0.50}{2.50} \\, \\mathrm{pmol \\, min^{-1} \\, mg^{-1}}$$\n$$v = 1.8 \\times 0.2 \\, \\mathrm{pmol \\, min^{-1} \\, mg^{-1}}$$\n$$v = 0.36 \\, \\mathrm{pmol \\, min^{-1} \\, mg^{-1}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$v = 0.3600 \\, \\mathrm{pmol \\, min^{-1} \\, mg^{-1}}$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3600}\n$$", "id": "4570748"}, {"introduction": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a critical interface protected by efflux transporters like P-glycoprotein, which limit the entry of many therapeutic agents into the central nervous system.

This confirms dimensional homogeneity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, self-contained, and quantitatively rigorous. A complete solution will now be derived.\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the steady-state flux-balance condition at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). At steady state, the total flux of the drug into the brain must equal the total flux out of the brain. The net flux is zero.\n\nThe fluxes involved are:\n1.  Passive diffusion, which occurs in both directions across the BBB.\n2.  Active efflux, which is a unidirectional transport from the brain to the plasma, mediated by P-glycoprotein (ABCB1).\n\nFirst, we define the passive flux component. According to Fick's law, the rate of diffusion is proportional to the permeability-surface area product ($PS$) and the concentration gradient. The net passive flux into the brain, $J_{pass, net}$, is the difference between passive influx and passive efflux:\n$$J_{pass, net} = (PS \\cdot C_{p,u}) - (PS \\cdot C_{b,u}) = PS (C_{p,u} - C_{b,u})$$\nHere, $C_{p,u}$ is the unbound drug concentration in plasma and $C_{b,u}$ is the unbound drug concentration in the brain's interstitial fluid. For unit consistency, concentrations given in µM are treated as nmol mL$^{-1}$, since $1$ µM $= 1$ µmol L$^{-1} = 1$ nmol mL$^{-1}$. Thus, the flux $J_{pass, net}$ has units of (mL min$^{-1}$ g$^{-1}$) $\\times$ (nmol mL$^{-1}$) = nmol min$^{-1}$ g$^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we define the active efflux component, $J_{active, out}$. This process is mediated by P-gp and follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The substrate for this efflux pump is the unbound drug within the brain, $C_{b,u}$. In the presence of a competitive inhibitor at concentration $I$, the standard Michaelis-Menten equation is modified. The apparent Michaelis constant, $K_{m,app}$, is given by:\n$$K_{m,app} = K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{I}{K_i}\\right)$$\nThe rate of active efflux from brain to plasma is then:\n$$J_{active, out} = \\frac{V_{\\max} \\cdot C_{b,u}}{K_{m,app} + C_{b,u}}$$\nwhere $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum rate of transport.\n\nAt steady state, the net flux across the BBB is zero. This means the net passive influx must be equal to the active efflux:\n$$J_{pass, net} = J_{active, out}$$\n$$PS (C_{p,u} - C_{b,u}) = \\frac{V_{\\max} \\cdot C_{b,u}}{K_{m,app} + C_{b,u}}$$\n\nTo solve for $C_{b,u}$, we rearrange this equation.\n$$PS (C_{p,u} - C_{b,u}) (K_{m,app} + C_{b,u}) = V_{\\max} \\cdot C_{b,u}$$\nExpanding the left side:\n$$PS (C_{p,u}K_{m,app} + C_{p,u}C_{b,u} - C_{b,u}K_{m,app} - C_{b,u}^2) = V_{\\max} \\cdot C_{b,u}$$\nDistributing $PS$:\n$$PS \\cdot C_{p,u}K_{m,app} + PS \\cdot C_{p,u}C_{b,u} - PS \\cdot K_{m,app}C_{b,u} - PS \\cdot C_{b,u}^2 = V_{\\max} \\cdot C_{b,u}$$\nRearranging into the standard quadratic form $a x^2 + b x + c = 0$, where $x = C_{b,u}$:\n$$(PS)C_{b,u}^2 + (V_{\\max} + PS \\cdot K_{m,app} - PS \\cdot C_{p,u})C_{b,u} - PS \\cdot C_{p,u}K_{m,app} = 0$$\nThe coefficients are:\n$a = PS$\n$b = V_{\\max} + PS(K_{m,app} - C_{p,u})$\n$c = -PS \\cdot C_{p,u}K_{m,app}$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values.

As stated in the problem, this can be expressed as the ratio of total influx clearance ($CL_{in}$) to total efflux clearance ($CL_{out}$) across the BBB.\n$$K_{p,uu,brain} = \\frac{C_{u,brain}}{C_{u,plasma}} = \\frac{CL_{in}}{CL_{out}}$$\nThe total flux into the brain is assumed to be solely by passive diffusion. Thus, the influx clearance is equal to the permeability-surface area product for passive transport.\n$$CL_{in} = PS_{passive}$$\nThe total efflux from the brain consists of two components: passive diffusion and active transport mediated by P-gp. Due to the assumption of symmetric passive diffusion, the passive efflux clearance is also $PS_{passive}$. The active transport clearance is denoted $CL_{active}$.\n$$CL_{out} = PS_{passive} + CL_{active}$$\nThe rate of active transport, $J_{active}$, follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, where the substrate is the unbound drug in the brain, $C_{u,brain}$:\n$$J_{active} = \\frac{V_{\\max} \\cdot C_{u,brain}}{K_{m} + C_{u,brain}}$$\nwhere $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum transport rate and $K_{m}$ is the Michaelis constant.

We are given the total plasma concentration $C_{\\mathrm{plasma,total}} = 3.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and the unbound fraction $f_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}} = 0.20$.\n$$[I]_u = C_{\\mathrm{plasma,total}} \\cdot f_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}} = (3.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\cdot (0.20) = 0.60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe inhibition constant is $K_i = 0.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\nThe active clearance in the presence of the inhibitor, $CL_{active,I}$, is:\n$$CL_{active,I} = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_{m,app}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_{m} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[I]_u}{K_i} \\right)} = \\frac{CL_{active,0}}{1 + \\frac{[I]_u}{K_i}}$$\nThe new partition coefficient in the presence of the inhibitor, $K_{p,uu,brain,I}$, is:\n$$K_{p,uu,brain,I} = \\frac{CL_{in}}{CL_{out,I}} = \\frac{PS_{passive}}{PS_{passive} + CL_{active,I}}$$\nTaking the reciprocal:\n$$\\frac{1}{K_{p,uu,brain,I}} = \\frac{PS_{passive} + CL_{active,I}}{PS_{passive}} = 1 + \\frac{CL_{active,I}}{PS_{passive}}$$\nSubstitute the expression for $CL_{active,I}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{K_{p,uu,brain,I}} = 1 + \\frac{1}{PS_{passive}} \\left( \\frac{CL_{active,0}}{1 + \\frac{[I]_u}{K_i}} \\right) = 1 + \\frac{\\frac{CL_{active,0}}{PS_{passive}}}{1 + \\frac{[I]_u}{K_i}}$$\nNow, substitute the expression for the ratio $\\frac{CL_{active,0}}{PS_{passive}}$ derived from the baseline condition:\n$$\\frac{1}{K_{p,uu,brain,I}} = 1 + \\frac{\\frac{1}{K_{p,uu,brain,0}} - 1}{1 + \\frac{[I]_u}{K_i}}$$\nThis is the final derived equation. We can now substitute the given numerical values to compute the result.\n\nGiven values:\n- $K_{p,uu,brain,0} = 0.08$\n- $[I]_u = 0.60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_i = 0.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nFirst, calculate the term related to active transport dominance:\n$$\\frac{1}{K_{p,uu,brain,0}} - 1 = \\frac{1}{0.08} - 1 = 12.5 - 1 = 11.5$$\nNext, calculate the term related to inhibition:\n$$1 + \\frac{[I]_u}{K_i} = 1 + \\frac{0.60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{0.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 1 + 2.4 = 3.4$$\nNow, substitute these into the expression for $\\frac{1}{K_{p,uu,brain,I}}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{K_{p,uu,brain,I}} = 1 + \\frac{11.5}{3.4} \\approx 1 + 3.3823529$$\n$$\\frac{1}{K_{p,uu,brain,I}} \\approx 4.3823529$$\nFinally, calculate $K_{p,uu,brain,I}$ by taking the reciprocal:\n$$K_{p,uu,brain,I} = \\frac{1}{4.3823529} \\approx 0.2281818...$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures as requested gives $0.2282$.\nThe presence of the inhibitor reduces P-gp efflux activity, leading to a higher unbound drug concentration in the brain relative to plasma, hence an increase in $K_{p,uu,brain}$ from $0.08$ to $0.2282$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2282}$$", "id": "4570749"}]}
