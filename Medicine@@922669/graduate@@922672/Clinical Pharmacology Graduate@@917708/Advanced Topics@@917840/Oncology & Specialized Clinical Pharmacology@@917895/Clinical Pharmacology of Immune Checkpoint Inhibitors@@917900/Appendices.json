Finally, a qualitative interpretation of the result is required.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical framework based on the law of mass action for the reversible binding of a ligand (the monoclonal antibody) to a receptor (PD-1). Let $R$ denote the free receptor, $C$ the free antibody concentration, and $RC$ the receptor-antibody complex. The problem states this is a $1:1$ interaction, which can be represented by the following chemical equilibrium:\n$$ R + C \\rightleftharpoons RC $$\n\nThe rate of the forward reaction (association) is given by $k_{on}[R][C]$, and the rate of the reverse reaction (dissociation) is given by $k_{off}[RC]$, where $k_{on}$ is the association rate constant, $k_{off}$ is the dissociation rate constant, and the brackets denote molar concentrations.\n\nThe problem states that binding is at thermodynamic equilibrium. At equilibrium, the rate of association equals the rate of dissociation:\n$$ k_{on}[R][C] = k_{off}[RC] $$\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined as the ratio of the dissociation rate constant to the association rate constant, $K_D = \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}}$. Rearranging the equilibrium equation, we can express $K_D$ in terms of the concentrations of the species:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{[R][C]}{[RC]} $$\nThis equation relates the concentrations of free receptor, free ligand, and the receptor-ligand complex at equilibrium.\n\nReceptor occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of the total receptor pool that is bound by the ligand. Let $R_T$ be the total concentration of receptors. The total receptor concentration is the sum of the free receptor concentration, $[R]$, and the bound receptor concentration, $[RC]$:\n$$ [R_T] = [R] + [RC] $$\nThe occupancy $\\theta$ is therefore:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RC]}{[R_T]} = \\frac{[RC]}{[R] + [RC]} $$\n\nTo derive an expression for $\\theta$ in terms of $C$ and $K_D$, we must eliminate $[R]$ and $[RC]$ from the expression for $\\theta$. We can rearrange the definition of $K_D$ to express $[R]$ in terms of $[RC]$, $[C]$, and $K_D$:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_D [RC]}{[C]} $$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the denominator of the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RC]}{\\left(\\frac{K_D [RC]}{[C]}\\right) + [RC]} $$\n\nWe can factor out $[RC]$ from the denominator:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RC]}{[RC] \\left(\\frac{K_D}{C} + 1\\right)} $$\n\nAssuming that some binding occurs, $[RC]$ is not zero, so we can cancel the $[RC]$ term from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D}{C} + 1} $$\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $C$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{C}{K_D + C} $$\nThis is the desired expression for receptor occupancy in terms of the free ligand concentration $C$ and the equilibrium dissociation constant $K_D$. This relationship is also known as the Hill-Langmuir equation for a non-cooperative ($n=1$) system.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\theta$ using the given values:\nFree antibody concentration, $C = 1\\,\\text{nM}$.\nEquilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D = 0.1\\,\\text{nM}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1\\,\\text{nM}}{0.1\\,\\text{nM} + 1\\,\\text{nM}} = \\frac{1}{1.1} $$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ \\theta = 0.909090... $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final value to four significant figures.\n$$ \\theta \\approx 0.9091 $$\n\nFinally, we interpret this result. The protein PD-1 is an inhibitory receptor on T cells. When activated by its natural ligands (e.g., PD-L1), it delivers a signal that suppresses T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and dampens T-cell effector functions. The drug is an antibody that binds to PD-1, acting as a competitive antagonist by blocking the binding of its natural ligands. The calculated occupancy, $\\theta \\approx 0.9091$, indicates that approximately $90.91\\%$ of all PD-1 receptors are bound and blocked by the antibody at the given steady-state concentration.\n\nAccording to the problem's assumption that the downstream effect is monotonic with occupancy, this high level of receptor blockade will substantially prevent PD-1 from delivering its inhibitory signal. The removal of this powerful inhibitory brake on T-cell activation leads to a disinhibition, or enhancement, of T-cell function. Therefore, the expected direction of change is a significant **increase** in TCR signaling and T-cell effector functions (such as proliferation, cytokine release, and cytotoxicity). The magnitude of this effect is expected to be high, as the occupancy is approaching saturation, suggesting a near-maximal achievable biological response for this mechanism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9091}$$", "id": "4536177"}, {"introduction": "Receptor occupancy is driven by drug concentration, and total drug exposure, often measured as the Area Under the Curve ($AUC$), is a key driver of the overall clinical response.

Pembrolizumab is a real drug, and the dose, administration route, and pharmacokinetic assumptions (linear disposition for a monoclonal antibody at therapeutic concentrations) are standard in clinical pharmacology. The clearance values are physiologically plausible. The relationship between dose, clearance, and exposure ($\\text{AUC}$) is a fundamental principle of pharmacokinetics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to compute the required ratio. The language is precise and objective. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific principles.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n**Quantitative Solution**\n\nThe total systemic clearance, $CL$, of a drug is a pharmacokinetic parameter that relates the rate of drug elimination from the body to its concentration in the plasma, $C(t)$. By definition, the rate of elimination is $CL \\cdot C(t)$.\n\nFrom the principle of mass balance, for a drug administered via an intravenous route, the total amount of drug eliminated from the body over all time must equal the total dose, $D$, that entered the systemic circulation. The total amount of drug eliminated is the integral of the rate of elimination from time zero to infinity:\n$$ \\text{Total amount eliminated} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\text{Rate of elimination} \\,dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} CL \\cdot C(t) \\,dt $$\nSince the problem states that the pharmacokinetics are time-invariant, $CL$ is a constant. Therefore, we can write:\n$$ \\text{Total amount eliminated} = CL \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t) \\,dt $$\nThe integral term, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t) \\,dt$, is by definition the area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time zero to infinity, $\\text{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty}$. Thus, the total amount eliminated is $CL \\cdot \\text{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty}$.\n\nEquating the amount of drug administered to the amount eliminated gives the fundamental relationship:\n$$ D = CL \\cdot \\text{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty} $$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for exposure:\n$$ \\text{AUC}_{0\\to\\infty} = \\frac{D}{CL} $$\nThis equation shows that for a given dose, total exposure is inversely proportional to clearance.\n\nLet $\\text{AUC}_1$ be the exposure corresponding to the initial clearance, $CL_1$, and $\\text{AUC}_2$ be the exposure corresponding to the final clearance, $CL_2$. The administered dose, $D = 200\\,\\text{mg}$, remains constant in both scenarios.\n$$ \\text{AUC}_1 = \\frac{D}{CL_1} $$\n$$ \\text{AUC}_2 = \\frac{D}{CL_2} $$\nThe problem asks for the fold change in total exposure, which is the ratio $\\frac{\\text{AUC}_2}{\\text{AUC}_1}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\text{AUC}_2}{\\text{AUC}_1} = \\frac{\\frac{D}{CL_2}}{\\frac{D}{CL_1}} = \\frac{D}{CL_2} \\cdot \\frac{CL_1}{D} = \\frac{CL_1}{CL_2} $$\nThe dose, $D$, cancels out, demonstrating that the fold change in exposure depends only on the ratio of the clearances.\n\nWe are given the values $CL_1 = 0.3\\,\\text{L/day}$ and $CL_2 = 0.2\\,\\text{L/day}$. Substituting these values into the expression:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{AUC}_2}{\\text{AUC}_1} = \\frac{0.3\\,\\text{L/day}}{0.2\\,\\text{L/day}} = 1.5 $$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact value $1.5$ can be written as $1.50$.\n\n**Qualitative Justification**\n\nThe fold change of $1.50$ signifies a $50\\%$ increase in the patient's total drug exposure. The relationship between drug exposure and its pharmacological effects (both desired and adverse) is a central tenet of clinical pharmacology, known as the exposure-response relationship.\n\n1.  **Influence on Efficacy**: The efficacy of an immune checkpoint inhibitor like pembrolizumab is driven by its ability to bind to and block the PD-1 receptor on T-cells, thereby restoring anti-tumor immune activity. This binding is concentration-dependent. The $50\\%$ increase in exposure ($\\text{AUC}$) implies that plasma concentrations of pembrolizumab will be higher and sustained for a longer duration. The impact of this increased exposure on efficacy depends on where the patient's initial exposure level lies on the exposure-efficacy curve. For monoclonal antibodies, this relationship is often shallow or flat (saturating) at therapeutic concentrations, meaning that once a certain level of exposure is reached to achieve nearmaximal receptor occupancy, further increases in exposure yield diminishing or no additional improvement in efficacy. If the patient's initial exposure with $CL_1 = 0.3\\,\\text{L/day}$ was already on this plateau, the increased exposure might not lead to a clinically meaningful improvement in anti-tumor response. However, if the initial exposure was on the rising portion of the curve, the $50\\%$ increase could potentially enhance the therapeutic effect.\n\n2.  **Influence on Safety (Immune-Related Adverse Events, irAEs)**: The mechanism of action of ICIs is also the cause of their characteristic toxicities, the irAEs, which arise from generalized immune system activation leading to inflammatory damage in healthy tissues. Like efficacy, the risk and severity of irAEs are also related to drug exposure. The exposure-toxicity relationship is often steeper and less prone to saturation than the exposure-efficacy relationship. Therefore, a $50\\%$ increase in total drug exposure is expected to increase the patient's risk of developing irAEs or increase the severity of existing irAEs. The heightened and more sustained immune activation from higher drug concentrations increases the probability of immunemediated damage to organs such as the colon (colitis), lungs (pneumonitis), skin (dermatitis), or endocrine glands (endocrinopathies).
