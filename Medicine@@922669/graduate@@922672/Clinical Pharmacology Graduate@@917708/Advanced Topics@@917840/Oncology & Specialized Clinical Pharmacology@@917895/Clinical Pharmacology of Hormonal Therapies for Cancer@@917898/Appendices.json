This works.\n            *   Let's solve for $k_{\\mathrm{AS}} \\times 2$.\n            *   $k_{\\mathrm{AS}} \\times 2 = \\frac{C_{ss,\\mathrm{END,cal}} \\times CL_{\\mathrm{END}}}{C_{ss,\\mathrm{TAM,cal}}} = \\frac{10,000 \\text{ ng/L} \\times 50 \\text{ L/h}}{468,750 \\text{ ng/L}} = \\frac{500,000}{468,750} \\text{ L/h} = \\frac{16}{15} \\text{ L/h}$.\n            *   So, $k_{\\mathrm{AS}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{16}{15} = \\frac{8}{15}$ L/h. The unit of $k_{AS}$ is L/h, which is a clearance per activity score unit. This makes sense.\n\n        2.  **Predict the patient's endoxifen concentration**:\n            *   Now use the calibrated model for the specific patient.\n            *   Patient givens: $AS = 1$, $\\phi = 0.30$, $D = 20$ mg once daily.\n            *   First, calculate the patient's effective activity score: $AS_{\\mathrm{eff,pat}} = AS \\times (1 - \\phi) = 1 \\times (1 - 0.30) = 0.70$.\n            *   Then, calculate the patient's endoxifen formation clearance: $CL_{\\mathrm{form,pat}} = k_{\\mathrm{AS}} \\times AS_{\\mathrm{eff,pat}} = \\frac{8}{15} \\text{ L/h} \\times 0.70 = \\frac{8}{15} \\times \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{56}{150} = \\frac{28}{75}$ L/h.\n            *   The patient's tamoxifen concentration is the same as the calibrator's, because $D$, $F_{\\mathrm{TAM}}$, $CL_{\\mathrm{TAM}}$, and $\\tau$ are the same.\n            *   $C_{ss,\\mathrm{TAM,pat}} = C_{ss,\\mathrm{TAM,cal}} = 468,750 \\text{ ng/L} = 468.75 \\text{ ng/mL}$.\n            *   Now calculate the patient's predicted endoxifen concentration:\n            *   $C_{ss,\\mathrm{END,pat}} = \\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{form,pat}} \\times C_{ss,\\mathrm{TAM,pat}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{END}}} = \\frac{(\\frac{28}{75} \\text{ L/h}) \\times (468,750 \\text{ ng/L})}{50 \\text{ L/h}}$.\n            *   $C_{ss,\\mathrm{END,pat}} = \\frac{28 \\times 468,750}{75 \\times 50} \\text{ ng/L} = \\frac{13,125,000}{3750} \\text{ ng/L} = 3500 \\text{ ng/L}$.\n            *   In ng/mL, this is $3.5$ ng/mL.\n\n        3.  **Compute the minimal dose multiple $D^{*}$**:\n            *   The target endoxifen concentration is $C_{ss,\\mathrm{END,target}} = 6$ ng/mL.\n            *   The model structure is $C_{ss,\\mathrm{END}} = \\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{form}} \\times C_{ss,\\mathrm{TAM}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{END}}}$.\n            *   Let's see how $C_{ss,\\mathrm{END}}$ depends on the dose $D$.\n            *   $C_{ss,\\mathrm{END}} = \\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{form}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{END}}} \\times C_{ss,\\mathrm{TAM}} = \\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{form}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{END}}} \\times \\left( \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{TAM}} \\times D}{CL_{\\mathrm{TAM}} \\times \\tau} \\right)$.\n            *   Since everything else is constant for the patient, $C_{ss,\\mathrm{END}}$ is directly proportional to $D$.\n            *   $C_{ss,\\mathrm{END}} \\propto D$.\n            *   Let the standard dose be $D_0 = 20$ mg, which results in $C_{ss,\\mathrm{END,pat}}(D_0) = 3.5$ ng/mL.\n            *   We want to find a new dose $D_{\\mathrm{new}}$ such that $C_{ss,\\mathrm{END,pat}}(D_{\\mathrm{new}}) = C_{ss,\\mathrm{END,target}} = 6$ ng/mL.\n            *   Because of the direct proportionality, we can set up a ratio:\n                $\\frac{C_{ss,\\mathrm{END,pat}}(D_{\\mathrm{new}})}{C_{ss,\\mathrm{END,pat}}(D_0)} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{new}}}{D_0}$.\n            *   The dose multiple $D^{*}$ is defined as $D^{*} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{new}}}{D_0}$.\n            *   So, $D^{*} = \\frac{C_{ss,\\mathrm{END,target}}}{C_{ss,\\mathrm{END,pat}}(D_0)} = \\frac{6 \\text{ ng/mL}}{3.5 \\text{ ng/mL}} = \\frac{6}{3.5} = \\frac{6}{7/2} = \\frac{12}{7}$.\n            *   The problem asks to round the final reported value of $D^{*}$ to three significant figures.\n            *   $D^{*} = 12 / 7 \\approx 1.7142857...$\n            *   Rounding to three significant figures gives $1.71$.\n            *   The problem mentions for context: \"dose escalation is considered if $D^{*} \\leq 2$\". Since $1.71 \\leq 2$, this outcome is consistent with a dose escalation strategy.\n\n4.  **Final Review and Formatting**:\n    *   I need to write the solution in a continuous block of text, using LaTeX for all mathematical entities.\n    *   The final answer must be in a `\\boxed{...}` environment.\n    *   I will double check my calculations.\n        *   $k_{\\mathrm{AS}}$ calculation: $C_{ss,\\mathrm{TAM,cal}} = \\frac{0.9 \\times 20 \\times 10^6 \\text{ ng}}{1.6 \\text{ L/h} \\times 24 \\text{ h}} = 468750 \\text{ ng/L}$. Correct.\n        *   $CL_{\\mathrm{form,cal}} = \\frac{C_{ss,\\mathrm{END,cal}} \\times CL_{\\mathrm{END}}}{C_{ss,\\mathrm{TAM,cal}}} = \\frac{10 \\times 10^3 \\text{ ng/L} \\times 50 \\text{ L/h}}{468750 \\text{ ng/L}} = \\frac{500000}{468750} \\text{ L/h} = \\frac{16}{15} \\text{ L/h}$. Correct.\n        *   $k_{\\mathrm{AS}} = CL_{\\mathrm{form,cal}} / AS_{\\mathrm{eff,cal}} = (\\frac{16}{15} \\text{ L/h}) / 2 = \\frac{8}{15}$ L/h. Correct.\n        *   Patient's $C_{ss,\\mathrm{END}}$ prediction: $AS_{\\mathrm{eff,pat}} = 1 \\times (1-0.3) = 0.7$.\n        *   $CL_{\\mathrm{form,pat}} = k_{\\mathrm{AS}} \\times AS_{\\mathrm{eff,pat}} = \\frac{8}{15} \\times 0.7 = \\frac{8}{15} \\times \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{56}{150} = \\frac{28}{75}$ L/h.
