All parameters are consistent and realistic for a typical RNA-seq experiment.\n\n#### Step 1.3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum integer sample size $n$ per group for a two-sided test of hypothesis on the log-fold change between two conditions.\n\nThe parameter of interest is the difference in the natural logarithm of the mean expression levels, $\\delta = \\log(\\mu_1) - \\log(\\mu_2)$. The hypotheses are:\n- Null hypothesis $H_0: \\delta = 0$.\n- Alternative hypothesis $H_A: \\delta \\neq 0$.\n\nThe estimator for $\\delta$ is $\\hat{\\delta} = \\log(\\bar{Y}_1) - \\log(\\bar{Y}_2)$, where $\\bar{Y}_k = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_{ik}$ is the sample mean of the counts in group $k$. We need to find the variance of this estimator to construct the test statistic and perform the power analysis.\n\nWe use the delta method to approximate the variance of $\\log(\\bar{Y}_k)$. For a function $g(X)$, $\\mathrm{Var}(g(X)) \\approx [g'(\\mathrm{E}[X])]^2 \\mathrm{Var}(X)$. Here, $g(x) = \\log(x)$, so $g'(x) = 1/x$. The random variable is $\\bar{Y}_k$.\n\nFirst, we find the expectation and variance of the sample mean $\\bar{Y}_k$:\n$\\mathrm{E}[\\bar{Y}_k] = \\mathrm{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_{ik}\\right] = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathrm{E}[Y_{ik}] = \\frac{1}{n} (n \\mu_k) = \\mu_k$.\n\nDue to independence of replicates, the variance of the sample mean is:\n$\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y}_k) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_{ik}\\right) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathrm{Var}(Y_{ik}) = \\frac{1}{n^2} (n (\\mu_k + \\phi \\mu_k^2)) = \\frac{\\mu_k + \\phi \\mu_k^2}{n}$.\n\nNow, applying the delta method to $\\log(\\bar{Y}_k)$:\n$\\mathrm{Var}(\\log(\\bar{Y}_k)) \\approx \\left(\\frac{d}{d\\bar{Y}_k} \\log(\\bar{Y}_k)\\bigg|_{\\mathrm{E}[\\bar{Y}_k]=\\mu_k}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{Y}_k) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_k}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\mu_k + \\phi \\mu_k^2}{n}\\right) = \\frac{\\mu_k + \\phi \\mu_k^2}{n \\mu_k^2} = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_k} + \\phi\\right)$.\n\nSince the two groups are independent, the variance of the difference $\\hat{\\delta}$ is the sum of the variances:\n$\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\delta}) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\log(\\bar{Y}_1)) + \\mathrm{Var}(\\log(\\bar{Y}_2)) = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_1} + \\phi\\right) + \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_2} + \\phi\\right) = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_1} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_2} + 2\\phi\\right)$.\n\nThe standard error of the estimator is $\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\delta}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_1} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_2} + 2\\phi\\right)}$.\n\nFor a two-sided test with type I error $\\alpha$ and power $1-\\beta$, the required sample size $n$ must satisfy the inequality:\n$\\frac{|\\delta|}{\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\delta})} \\ge z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta}$\nwhere $z_q$ is the $q$-th quantile of the standard normal distribution.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\delta})$:\n$\\frac{|\\log(\\mu_1/\\mu_2)|}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_1} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_2} + 2\\phi\\right)}} \\ge z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta}$.\n\nSolving for $n$:\n$\\sqrt{n} \\ge \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\mu_1} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_2} + 2\\phi} (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})}{|\\log(\\mu_1/\\mu_2)|}$\n$n \\ge \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_1} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_2} + 2\\phi\\right) (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{(\\log(\\mu_1/\\mu_2))^2}$.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem:\n- $\\mu_1 = 20$\n- $\\mu_2 = 10$\n- $\\phi = 0.20$\n- $\\alpha = 0.05$, so $1 - \\alpha/2 = 0.975$. The corresponding normal quantile is $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.959964$.\n- $1 - \\beta = 0.80$, so $\\beta=0.20$. The corresponding normal quantile is $z_{1-\\beta} = z_{0.80} \\approx 0.841621$.\n\nThe effect size is $\\delta = \\log(\\mu_1/\\mu_2) = \\log(20/10) = \\log(2)$.\nThe variance term is $\\frac{1}{\\mu_1} + \\frac{1}{\\mu_2} + 2\\phi = \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1}{10} + 2(0.20) = 0.05 + 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.55$.\n\nPlugging these into the inequality for $n$:\n$n \\ge \\frac{0.55 \\times (1.959964 + 0.841621)^2}{(\\log(2))^2}$\n$n \\ge \\frac{0.55 \\times (2.801585)^2}{(\\log(2))^2}$\n$n \\ge \\frac{0.55 \\times 7.848879...}{(0.693147...)^2}$\n$n \\ge \\frac{4.316883...}{0.480453...}$\n$n \\ge 8.98504...$\n\nSince the number of biological replicates $n$ must be an integer, we must take the smallest integer that satisfies this condition, which is the ceiling of the calculated value.\n$n = \\lceil 8.98504... \\rceil = 9$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer number of biological replicates required per group is $9$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{9}\n$$", "id": "4569652"}, {"introduction": "Once RNA-seq data is generated, raw read counts can be misleading as they are biased by factors like transcript length and total sequencing depth.

TPM and FPKM are standard, well-defined metrics in transcriptomics. The genes listed are authentic and of high relevance to clinical pharmacology. The data values are plausible for a simplified but realistic experimental scenario.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information for the calculation. The instruction to \"treat the five listed transcripts as constituting the entire expressed transcriptome for this calculation\" clarifies the computational scope, rendering the total mapped fragments value $N$ as extraneous but not contradictory information. The objective is clearly stated, and a unique solution exists.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free of bias or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no inconsistencies or ambiguities that would prevent a rigorous solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution\n\n#### Conceptual Definitions and Derivation\n\nThe central principle of RNA-seq is that it is a sampling process. The number of sequence fragments (or reads) that align to a particular transcript is a function of that transcript's abundance in the original cellular RNA pool and its length. Longer transcripts provide a larger target for the random fragmentation process that precedes sequencing. Therefore, raw fragment counts are not directly comparable.\n\n- **Unnormalized Fragment Counts**: This is the raw number of fragments that align to a specific transcript. This metric is biased by both transcript length (a long, moderately expressed transcript can yield more fragments than a short, highly expressed one) and sequencing depth (a sample sequenced to a greater depth will have higher counts for all transcripts).\n\n- **Fragments Per Kilobase per Million mapped fragments (FPKM)**: This metric normalizes for both length and sequencing depth. For a transcript $i$ with $r_i$ raw fragment counts and an effective length of $\\ell_i$ kilobases in a sample with a total of $N$ million mapped fragments, FPKM is calculated as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FPKM}_i = \\frac{r_i}{\\ell_i \\times (N/10^6)}\n$$\nThe normalization is performed by first dividing the count by the transcript's length in kilobases (giving fragments per kilobase) and then dividing by the total number of mapped fragments in the library in millions (the sequencing depth factor). While FPKM corrects for both biases, it has a statistical deficiency: the sum of FPKM values across a sample is not constant and depends on the expression profile of the sample itself. This makes comparing the relative proportion of transcripts between samples problematic.\n\n- **Transcripts Per Million (TPM)**: This metric also normalizes for length and sequencing depth but in a different order, which results in a more stable and proportional measure.\n    1.  First, for every transcript $j$ in the sample, its raw fragment count $r_j$ is normalized by its length $\\ell_j$ (in kb). This value, $c_j = r_j/\\ell_j$, represents a length-normalized signal and is proportional to the molar abundance of the transcript.\n    2.  Next, these length-normalized signals are summed across all transcripts in the sample to obtain a total length-normalized signal: $S = \\sum_j c_j = \\sum_j \\frac{r_j}{\\ell_j}$.\n    3.  The proportion of each transcript is then calculated by dividing its individual length-normalized signal $c_i$ by the total signal $S$.\n    4.  Finally, this proportion is scaled by one million to give the TPM value.\n\nThis sequence of operations constitutes the first-principles derivation requested. The formula for the TPM of transcript $i$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TPM}_i = \\left( \\frac{r_i / \\ell_i}{\\sum_j (r_j / \\ell_j)} \\right) \\times 10^6\n$$\nA key advantage of TPM is that the sum of the TPM values for all transcripts in a sample always equals $10^6$. This means that each TPM value represents a relative proportion of the total pool of transcripts, making it more suitable for comparing transcript proportions across different samples.\n\n#### Calculation of TPM for CYP3A4\n\nThe problem specifies that for this calculation, the transcriptome consists solely of the five listed transcripts. We will apply the derived TPM formula to compute the value for CYP3A4. Let the index $i$ refer to CYP3A4, and the index $j$ span the set of five transcripts: $\\{\\text{A4}, \\text{2C9}, \\text{2D6}, \\text{ABCB1}, \\text{UGT1A1}\\}$.\n\nThe formula is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TPM}_{\\text{A4}} = \\frac{r_{\\text{A4}} / \\ell_{\\text{A4}}}{\\left( \\frac{r_{\\text{A4}}}{\\ell_{\\text{A4}}} + \\frac{r_{\\text{2C9}}}{\\ell_{\\text{2C9}}} + \\frac{r_{\\text{2D6}}}{\\ell_{\\text{2D6}}} + \\frac{r_{\\text{ABCB1}}}{\\ell_{\\text{ABCB1}}} + \\frac{r_{\\text{UGT1A1}}}{\\ell_{\\text{UGT1A1}}} \\right)} \\times 10^6\n$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the length-normalized signal for each transcript ($c_j = r_j / \\ell_j$):\n- $c_{\\text{A4}} = \\frac{380000}{4.8} = 79166.666...$\n- $c_{\\text{2C9}} = \\frac{140000}{3.2} = 43750$\n- $c_{\\text{2D6}} = \\frac{60000}{4.4} \\approx 13636.363...$\n- $c_{\\text{ABCB1}} = \\frac{90000}{4.6} \\approx 19565.217...$\n- $c_{\\text{UGT1A1}} = \\frac{110000}{2.0} = 55000$\n\nNext, we sum these values to find the total length-normalized signal, $S$:\n$$\nS = 79166.666... + 43750 + 13636.363... + 19565.217... + 55000\n$$\n$$\nS \\approx 211118.24769\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the TPM for CYP3A4:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TPM}_{\\text{A4}} = \\left( \\frac{c_{\\text{A4}}}{S} \\right) \\times 10^6\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{TPM}_{\\text{A4}} = \\left( \\frac{79166.666...}{211118.24769} \\right) \\times 10^6\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{TPM}_{\\text{A4}} \\approx 0.375000083 \\times 10^6\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{TPM}_{\\text{A4}} \\approx 375000.083\n$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TPM}_{\\text{A4}} = 3.750 \\times 10^5\n$$\nThis value is dimensionless, as the units in the numerator and denominator of the proportion cancel out.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.750 \\times 10^5}\n$$", "id": "4569575"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate promise of pharmacogenomics is to tailor drug therapy to an individual's genetic makeup, maximizing efficacy while minimizing risk.
