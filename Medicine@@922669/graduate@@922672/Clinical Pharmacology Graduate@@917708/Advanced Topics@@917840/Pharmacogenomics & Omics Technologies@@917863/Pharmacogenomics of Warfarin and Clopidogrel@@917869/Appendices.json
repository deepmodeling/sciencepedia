Warfarin is a racemic mixture, with the S-enantiomer being more potent. S-warfarin is principally metabolized by the polymorphic enzyme CYP2C9, and its target is VKORC1. A reduced-function CYP2C9 allele is known to decrease S-warfarin clearance, necessitating a lower dose. The use of pharmacokinetic principles such as clearance, bioavailability, and steady-state concentration is appropriate and standard. The premises are factually correct within the context of clinical pharmacology.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is self-contained. The goal to \"maintain the same S-warfarin exposure\" provides a clear, formalizable objective. The assumptions of linear kinetics, constant bioavailability, and a fixed dosing interval are sufficient to establish a unique relationship between dose and clearance. The question asks for a specific, calculable ratio.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language (e.g., \"$30\\%$ decrease\") and established scientific terms. It is free from subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A formal solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem requires maintaining the same S-warfarin exposure at steady-state. For a drug exhibiting linear pharmacokinetics, exposure over a dosing interval, $\\tau$, at steady-state ($ss$) is quantified by the Area Under the plasma concentration-time Curve, $AUC_{\\tau,ss}$. The average steady-state plasma concentration, $C_{ss,avg}$, is directly proportional to this exposure, defined as:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{AUC_{\\tau,ss}}{\\tau}$$\nThe fundamental equation for the average steady-state concentration of a drug administered orally is given by:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL \\cdot \\tau}$$\nwhere $D$ is the maintenance dose administered every interval $\\tau$, $F$ is the fraction of the dose that is bioavailable, and $CL$ is the total body clearance of the drug.\n\nThe problem's central condition is that the exposure must be the same for the patient (new) as for a reference individual (old). Since the dosing interval $\\tau$ is constant, this is equivalent to requiring the average steady-state concentrations to be equal.\n$$C_{ss,avg,new} = C_{ss,avg,old}$$\nSubstituting the general expression for $C_{ss,avg}$ into this equality yields:\n$$\\frac{F_{new} \\cdot D_{new}}{CL_{new} \\cdot \\tau_{new}} = \\frac{F_{old} \\cdot D_{old}}{CL_{old} \\cdot \\tau_{old}}$$\nThe problem states several simplifying conditions: bioavailability $F$ is unchanged ($F_{new} = F_{old}$), and the dosing interval $\\tau$ is fixed ($\\tau_{new} = \\tau_{old}$). Applying these constraints allows us to cancel these terms from the equation:\n$$\\frac{D_{new}}{CL_{new}} = \\frac{D_{old}}{CL_{old}}$$\nThis equation is the expression relating the maintenance dose to clearance under the condition of constant exposure. It shows that to maintain a target steady-state concentration, the maintenance dose must be directly proportional to the drug's clearance. We can express this relationship as $D = k \\cdot CL$, where the constant of proportionality is $k = \\frac{C_{ss,avg} \\cdot \\tau}{F}$, which is fixed since the target exposure ($C_{ss,avg}$), dosing interval ($\\tau$), and bioavailability ($F$) are all constant.\n\nThe next task is to find the multiplicative factor for the dose adjustment, which is the ratio $\\frac{D_{\\text{new}}}{D_{\\text{old}}}$. Rearranging the derived relationship gives:\n$$\\frac{D_{\\text{new}}}{D_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{CL_{new}}{CL_{old}}$$\nThe problem states that the patient's S-warfarin clearance, $CL_{new}$, is decreased by $30\\%$ relative to the reference clearance, $CL_{old}$. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$CL_{new} = CL_{old} - 0.30 \\cdot CL_{old}$$\nFactoring out $CL_{old}$ gives:\n$$CL_{new} = (1 - 0.30) \\cdot CL_{old}$$\n$$CL_{new} = 0.70 \\cdot CL_{old}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $CL_{new}$ back into the dose ratio equation:\n$$\\frac{D_{\\text{new}}}{D_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{0.70 \\cdot CL_{old}}{CL_{old}}$$\nThe term $CL_{old}$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator, yielding the final multiplicative factor:\n$$\\frac{D_{\\text{new}}}{D_{\\text{old}}} = 0.70$$\nThis result indicates that the maintenance dose for the patient with reduced CYP2C9 activity should be $70\\%$ of the dose for a reference individual to achieve the same therapeutic exposure to S-warfarin.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.70}$$", "id": "4573346"}, {"introduction": "While single-factor adjustments are illustrative, real-world warfarin dosing is a multifactorial challenge.

The clinical mechanism is that clopidogrel is a prodrug requiring biotransformation by cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) to its active thiol; carriers of loss-of-function (LOF) CYP2C19 alleles have reduced active metabolite exposure and higher stent thrombosis risk when maintained on clopidogrel.
