The parameters are clearly defined, and there are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n#### Step 1.3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined problem in population genetics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Detailed Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds by first calculating the genotype frequencies in the source population, then applying the selection pressures (drug discontinuation probabilities) to find the genotype frequencies in the week $12$ cohort, and finally using these new frequencies to calculate the inbreeding coefficient $F$.\n\n1.  **Initial Genotype Frequencies in the Source Population**\n\nThe source population is in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). The allele frequencies are given as:\n- Frequency of major allele $A$: $p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$\n- Frequency of minor allele $a$: $q = 0.3$\n\nUnder HWE, the genotype frequencies at baseline are:\n- Frequency of $AA$: $P_{AA} = p^2 = (0.7)^2 = 0.49$\n- Frequency of $Aa$: $P_{Aa} = 2pq = 2(0.7)(0.3) = 0.42$\n- Frequency of $aa$: $P_{aa} = q^2 = (0.3)^2 = 0.09$\nThe sum of these frequencies is $0.49 + 0.42 + 0.09 = 1.0$, as expected.\n\n2.  **Genotype Frequencies in the Week 12 Cohort**\n\nThe probabilities of remaining on therapy, $s_{AA}=0.85$, $s_{Aa}=0.60$, and $s_{aa}=0.15$, act as selection coefficients. We apply these multiplicatively to the baseline genotype frequencies to find the proportional representation of each genotype in the week $12$ cohort.\n\nThe unnormalized frequencies are:\n- $P_{AA} \\times s_{AA} = 0.49 \\times 0.85 = 0.4165$\n- $P_{Aa} \\times s_{Aa} = 0.42 \\times 0.60 = 0.2520$\n- $P_{aa} \\times s_{aa} = 0.09 \\times 0.15 = 0.0135$\n\nTo find the new genotype frequencies in the week $12$ cohort, we must normalize by the sum of these values. This sum represents the mean survival rate, $\\bar{s}$.\n$$ \\bar{s} = (P_{AA} \\times s_{AA}) + (P_{Aa} \\times s_{Aa}) + (P_{aa} \\times s_{aa}) $$\n$$ \\bar{s} = 0.4165 + 0.2520 + 0.0135 = 0.6820 $$\n\nThe renormalized genotype frequencies in the week $12$ cohort (let's denote them $P'$) are:\n- $P'_{AA} = \\frac{P_{AA} s_{AA}}{\\bar{s}} = \\frac{0.4165}{0.6820}$\n- $P'_{Aa} = \\frac{P_{Aa} s_{Aa}}{\\bar{s}} = \\frac{0.2520}{0.6820}$\n- $P'_{aa} = \\frac{P_{aa} s_{aa}}{\\bar{s}} = \\frac{0.0135}{0.6820}$\n\n3.  **Allele Frequencies in the Week 12 Cohort**\n\nNext, we calculate the allele frequencies, $p'$ and $q'$, in this new cohort.\nThe frequency of allele $A$, $p'$, is the frequency of $AA$ homozygotes plus half the frequency of $Aa$ heterozygotes:\n$$ p' = P'_{AA} + \\frac{1}{2}P'_{Aa} = \\frac{0.4165}{0.6820} + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{0.2520}{0.6820} \\right) = \\frac{0.4165 + 0.1260}{0.6820} = \\frac{0.5425}{0.6820} $$\nThe frequency of allele $a$, $q'$, is the frequency of $aa$ homozygotes plus half the frequency of $Aa$ heterozygotes:\n$$ q' = P'_{aa} + \\frac{1}{2}P'_{Aa} = \\frac{0.0135}{0.6820} + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{0.2520}{0.6820} \\right) = \\frac{0.0135 + 0.1260}{0.6820} = \\frac{0.1395}{0.6820} $$\nAs a check, $p' + q' = \\frac{0.5425 + 0.1395}{0.6820} = \\frac{0.6820}{0.6820} = 1$.\n\n4.  **Calculation of Wright's Inbreeding Coefficient ($F$)**\n\nWright's inbreeding coefficient $F$ measures the deviation of the observed heterozygote frequency from the frequency expected under HWE. The formula is:\n$$ F = \\frac{H_{exp} - H_{obs}}{H_{exp}} = 1 - \\frac{H_{obs}}{H_{exp}} $$\nHere, the observed heterozygote frequency, $H_{obs}$, is the frequency of the $Aa$ genotype in the week $12$ cohort, which is $P'_{Aa}$.\n$$ H_{obs} = P'_{Aa} = \\frac{0.2520}{0.6820} $$\nThe expected heterozygote frequency, $H_{exp}$, is the frequency that would be observed in a population with allele frequencies $p'$ and $q'$ if it were in HWE.\n$$ H_{exp} = 2p'q' = 2 \\left( \\frac{0.5425}{0.6820} \\right) \\left( \\frac{0.1395}{0.6820} \\right) = \\frac{2 \\times 0.5425 \\times 0.1395}{(0.6820)^2} $$\nNow, we substitute these into the formula for $F$:\n$$ F = 1 - \\frac{\\frac{0.2520}{0.6820}}{\\frac{2 \\times 0.5425 \\times 0.1395}{(0.6820)^2}} $$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$ F = 1 - \\left( \\frac{0.2520}{0.6820} \\times \\frac{(0.6820)^2}{2 \\times 0.5425 \\times 0.1395} \\right) $$\n$$ F = 1 - \\frac{0.2520 \\times 0.6820}{2 \\times 0.5425 \\times 0.1395} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical values:\n$$ F = 1 - \\frac{0.171864}{0.1513575} $$\n$$ F = 1 - 1.13549301... $$\n$$ F = -0.13549301... $$\nA negative value for $F$ indicates an excess of heterozygotes in the week $12$ cohort compared to the HWE expectation for the new allele frequencies. This is a consequence of the specific selection pressures.\n\n5.  **Final Answer**\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ F \\approx -0.1355 $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-0.1355} $$", "id": "4556675"}, {"introduction": "When we scan millions of genetic variants in a GWAS, the variants that pass a stringent statistical threshold are often those that, by chance, have an exaggerated estimated effect.

We must analyze the genetic associations with both myopathy (an adverse effect) and LDL cholesterol change (the intended therapeutic effect).\n\n### Analysis of Myopathy Association ($Y$)\n\n1.  **Effect of $G$ in the Placebo Arm**: The logistic model for the placebo arm ($D=0$) shows that the coefficient for the genotype, $\\hat{\\beta}_P$, is $0.20$ with a p-value less than $0.001$. This is a statistically significant association. It indicates that the variant $G$ is associated with an increased risk of myopathy even in the *absence* of statin treatment. The per-allele odds ratio is $\\exp(0.20) \\approx 1.22$. This represents a baseline, drug-independent effect of the gene on myopathy risk.\n\n2.  **Effect of $G$ in the Statin Arm**: The model for the statin arm ($D=1$) shows $\\hat{\\beta}_T = 0.22$ ($p  0.001$), which is also highly significant. The per-allele odds ratio is $\\exp(0.22) \\approx 1.25$. This confirms the association between $G$ and myopathy in individuals taking the statin.\n\n3.  **Gene-Drug Interaction for Myopathy**: The interaction model tests whether the effect of $G$ on myopathy risk is different between the placebo and statin arms. The interaction coefficient, $\\psi$, represents the difference in the log-odds ratios: $\\psi = \\beta_T - \\beta_P$. The estimate is $\\hat{\\psi} = 0.22 - 0.20 = 0.02$. This value is small, and its p-value is large ($p=0.76$), indicating no statistically significant evidence of a gene-drug interaction. The effect of variant $G$ on myopathy risk is approximately constant whether or not the individual is taking a statin.\n\n### Analysis of Lipid Response Association ($\\Delta L$)\n\n1.  **Effect of $G$ in the Placebo Arm**: The linear model for lipid change ($\\Delta L$) in the placebo arm ($D=0$) yields a coefficient $\\hat{\\gamma}_P = 0.10$ with a p-value of $0.73$. This is not statistically significant. It means the variant $G$ has no discernible effect on LDL cholesterol changes in the absence of the drug.\n\n2.  **Effect of $G$ in the Statin Arm**: The model for the statin arm ($D=1$) yields a coefficient $\\hat{\\gamma}_T = -10.0$ with a p-value $ 10^{-10}$. This is a highly significant association. It indicates that the variant $G$ strongly modulates the LDL-lowering effect of the statin. For each copy of the allele represented by $G$, the statin-induced LDL reduction is greater by $10.0$ $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. This is a classic pharmacogenomic effect on an on-target efficacy endpoint, representing a strong gene-drug interaction.\n\n### Synthesis and Interpretation of Pleiotropy\n\n-   **Pleiotropy**: The variant $G$ is associated with two distinct phenotypes: myopathy risk and statin-induced LDL response. This is, by definition, pleiotropy.\n-   **Horizontal vs. Vertical Pleiotropy**: The problem defines two types of pleiotropy.\n    -   *Vertical pleiotropy*: $G \\rightarrow \\Delta L \\rightarrow Y$. The effect of the gene on myopathy is mediated through its effect on lipid lowering.\n    -   *Horizontal pleiotropy*: $G$ influences $Y$ and $\\Delta L$ through independent biological pathways.\n-   **Evaluating the evidence**: In the placebo arm, variant $G$ is significantly associated with myopathy ($Y$) but has no association with lipid changes ($\\Delta L$). This observation directly refutes the hypothesis that the effect of $G$ on myopathy is *mediated by* its effect on $\\Delta L$. The pathway from $G$ to myopathy must be, at least in part, independent of the LDL-cholesterol pathway. This is the definition of horizontal pleiotropy. The myopathy risk associated with $G$ is an \"off-target\" effect, as it is unrelated to the drug's intended mechanism of action (lipid lowering).\n-   **Summary**:\n    1.  $G$ has a main effect on myopathy risk, independent of statin treatment. This is evidence of an inherent, off-target susceptibility.\n    2.  $G$ has a pharmacogenomic effect (gene-drug interaction) on the on-target outcome, LDL cholesterol response.\n    3.  Together, these findings strongly support a model of horizontal pleiotropy.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The variant $G$ exhibits horizontal pleiotropy that confers off-target susceptibility to myopathy independent of statin exposure, while $G$ modulates on-target lipid response only under treatment.**\n-   \"horizontal pleiotropy\": Correct. As derived above, the effect of $G$ on myopathy in the placebo arm, where there is no effect on $\\Delta L$, demonstrates a pathway independent of lipid-lowering.\n-   \"confers off-target susceptibility to myopathy independent of statin exposure\": Correct. The significant association in the placebo arm ($\\hat{\\beta}_P = 0.20, p  0.001$) and the non-significant interaction term ($\\hat{\\psi}=0.02, p=0.76$) show that the myopathy risk from $G$ exists at baseline and is not significantly modified by statin treatment.\n-   \"G modulates on-target lipid response only under treatment\": Correct. The coefficient $\\hat{\\gamma}_P$ is non-significant ($p=0.73$), while $\\hat{\\gamma}_T$ is highly significant ($p  10^{-10}$).\nThis option accurately synthesizes all key findings.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The variant $G$ exhibits vertical pleiotropy mediated by lipid lowering, because the stronger per-allele effect on $\\Delta L$ in the statin arm implies that the increased myopathy risk is caused by greater LDL reduction.**\n-   This option claims vertical pleiotropy ($G \\rightarrow \\Delta L \\rightarrow Y$). This is contradicted by the data. If this mechanism were true, there should be no association between $G$ and myopathy ($Y$) in the placebo arm, since $G$ has no effect on $\\Delta L$ in that arm. However, the data show a strong association ($\\hat{\\beta}_P = 0.20, p  0.001$). Furthermore, if greater LDL reduction caused myopathy, we would expect a significant gene-drug interaction for myopathy ($\\psi  0$), which was not observed.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The similar associations of $G$ with myopathy in both arms indicate residual population stratification; therefore the myopathy signal is confounded and unrelated to pleiotropy.**\n-   The analysis explicitly adjusted for the top $10$ ancestry principal components, which is the standard method for mitigating confounding by population stratification. While residual confounding is always a theoretical possibility, dismissing a strong, consistent biological signal as an artifact without stronger evidence is not sound scientific reasoning. The signal's presence in a randomized trial, combined with its specificity (affecting myopathy but not baseline LDL), makes confounding a less likely explanation than a true biological effect. The similarity of association is data, not an artifact; it argues against a gene-drug interaction for myopathy.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The data support a pure pharmacokinetic effect with no pleiotropy; the myopathy association arises from LD with variants influencing adherence behavior rather than biology.**\n-   A \"pure\" pharmacokinetic effect would mean the gene's influence is contingent on the presence of the drug. Such an effect should be absent in the placebo arm. However, the variant $G$ is strongly associated with myopathy in the placebo arm ($\\hat{\\beta}_P \\neq 0$). This single finding refutes the claim of a \"pure\" pharmacokinetic effect.\n-   The claim of \"no pleiotropy\" is false; the gene is associated with two different traits (myopathy and drug-response for LDL).\n-   The explanation involving adherence behavior is speculative and inconsistent with the finding of an association in the placebo arm. There is no reason a gene related to \"adherence\" would cause myopathy in patients receiving a placebo in a double-blind trial.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4556692"}]}
