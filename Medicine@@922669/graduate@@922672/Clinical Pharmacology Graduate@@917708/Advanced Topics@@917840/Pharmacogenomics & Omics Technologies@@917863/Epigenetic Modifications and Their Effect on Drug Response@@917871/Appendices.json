Consider a promoter containing $n$ distinct cytosine–phosphate–guanine (CpG) sites whose unmethylated state is necessary for effective transcription factor (TF) binding and transcriptional initiation. Assume the following foundational facts and modeling assumptions grounded in molecular pharmacology:\n- Epigenetic DNA methylation is the enzymatic addition of a methyl group to cytosine by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), which can impair TF binding at CpG sites, thereby reducing transcription initiation.\n- Under the Central Dogma, decreased promoter activity reduces messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) synthesis rate and, at steady state with constant mRNA degradation and translation efficiency, proportionally lowers enzyme abundance.\n- Let $m$ denote the fractional methylation level of the promoter CpG sites, defined as the probability that any given CpG site is methylated at a randomly sampled time and cell. Assume independence of methylation states across the $n$ CpG sites and stationarity over the timescale of transcription initiation.\n- The promoter is considered transcriptionally competent only when all $n$ CpG sites are unmethylated; thus, the instantaneous probability that the promoter is in an active state is equal to the probability that all $n$ sites are unmethylated.\n- Promoter activity $A$ is proportional to this probability, and $A_{\\max}$ denotes the activity in the hypothetical limit of zero methylation.\n\nStarting from these assumptions and basic probability for independent Bernoulli events, derive an expression for the relative promoter activity $A/A_{\\max}$ as a function of $m$ and $n$.

The derivation will be followed by an evaluation for specific parameter values.\n\nLet $m$ be the fractional methylation level, defined as the probability that any single cytosine–phosphate–guanine (CpG) site is methylated. Therefore, the probability for a single CpG site to be unmethylated is $1-m$. These two states, methylated and unmethylated, represent a Bernoulli trial for each site.\n\nThe promoter is stated to contain $n$ distinct CpG sites. A crucial assumption is that the methylation states of these $n$ sites are independent events.\n\nThe model specifies that the promoter is transcriptionally competent, or \"active,\" if and only if all $n$ CpG sites are simultaneously in the unmethylated state.
