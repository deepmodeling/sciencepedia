The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Coupled ODEs**\n\nThe reversible reaction is given by the stoichiometry $R + D \\rightleftharpoons RD$. The forward reaction (association) is $R+D \\rightarrow RD$ and the reverse reaction (dissociation) is $RD \\rightarrow R+D$.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action for elementary reactions, the rate of the forward reaction, $v_f$, is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants:\n$$v_f = k_{\\text{on}} R(t) D(t)$$\nThe rate of the reverse reaction, $v_r$, is proportional to the concentration of its reactant:\n$$v_r = k_{\\text{off}} RD(t)$$\n\nThe net rate of change for each species is the sum of the rates of the reactions that produce it minus the sum of the rates of the reactions that consume it.\n\nFor the receptor-drug complex, $RD(t)$, it is formed by the forward reaction and consumed by the reverse reaction. Thus, its rate of change is:\n$$\\frac{d(RD)}{dt} = v_f - v_r = k_{\\text{on}} R(t) D(t) - k_{\\text{off}} RD(t)$$\n\nFor the free receptor, $R(t)$, it is consumed by the forward reaction and produced by the reverse reaction. Its rate of change is:\n$$\\frac{dR}{dt} = v_r - v_f = k_{\\text{off}} RD(t) - k_{\\text{on}} R(t) D(t)$$\n\nSimilarly, for the free drug, $D(t)$, it is also consumed by the forward reaction and produced by the reverse reaction. Its rate of change is:\n$$\\frac{dD}{dt} = v_r - v_f = k_{\\text{off}} RD(t) - k_{\\text{on}} R(t) D(t)$$\n\nThese three ODEs describe the dynamics of the system. Note that $\\frac{d(RD)}{dt} = -\\frac{dR}{dt} = -\\frac{dD}{dt}$, which is consistent with the stoichiometry of the reaction and the provided conservation laws. Differentiating $R(t) + RD(t) = R_{\\text{tot}}$ with respect to time $t$ yields $\\frac{dR}{dt} + \\frac{d(RD)}{dt} = 0$, which is satisfied by our derived ODEs.\n\n**2. Determination of the Equilibrium Solution**\n\nAt chemical equilibrium, the net rate of change of all concentrations is zero. We denote the equilibrium concentrations of free receptor, free drug, and complex as $R$, $D$, and $RD$, respectively, dropping the explicit time dependence. The problem statement itself uses $D$ to denote the equilibrium free drug concentration.\n\nSetting the time derivatives to zero:\n$$\\frac{d(RD)}{dt} = 0$$\nThis implies:\n$$k_{\\text{on}} R D - k_{\\text{off}} RD = 0$$\nRearranging the terms, we find the balance between association and dissociation at equilibrium:\n$$k_{\\text{on}} R D = k_{\\text{off}} RD$$\n\nThe problem defines the equilibrium dissociation constant as $K_D = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}$. We can divide the equilibrium balance equation by $k_{\\text{on}}$ to introduce $K_D$:\n$$R D = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}} RD$$\n$$R D = K_D RD$$\n\nThe problem requests the equilibrium concentration of the complex, $RD$, in terms of the total receptor concentration $R_{\\text{tot}}$, the equilibrium free drug concentration $D$, and $K_D$. To achieve this, we use the conservation law for receptors, which also holds at equilibrium:\n$$R + RD = R_{\\text{tot}}$$\nFrom this, we express the equilibrium free receptor concentration $R$ in terms of $R_{\\text{tot}}$ and $RD$:\n$$R = R_{\\text{tot}} - RD$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $R$ into our equilibrium condition $R D = K_D RD$:\n$$(R_{\\text{tot}} - RD) D = K_D RD$$\nAn important assumption, as implied by the problem's framing, is that the equilibrium free drug concentration $D$ is treated as a known independent variable. This is a common scenario in pharmacology experiments where $D$ is either directly measured or is assumed to be approximately equal to the total drug concentration, $D_{\\text{tot}}$, under the condition $D_{\\text{tot}} \\gg R_{\\text{tot}}$.\n\nWe now solve the equation for $RD$:\n$$R_{\\text{tot}} D - RD \\cdot D = K_D RD$$\n$$R_{\\text{tot}} D = RD \\cdot D + K_D RD$$\nFactor out $RD$ on the right-hand side:\n$$R_{\\text{tot}} D = RD (D + K_D)$$\nFinally, isolating $RD$ gives the desired equilibrium solution:\n$$RD = \\frac{R_{\\text{tot}} D}{D + K_D}$$\n\n**3. Computation of the Fractional Occupancy**\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $f$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are bound to the drug.\n$$f = \\frac{RD}{R_{\\text{tot}}}$$\nUsing the expression for the equilibrium concentration of $RD$ derived in the previous step, we substitute it into the definition of $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{tot}}} \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{tot}} D}{D + K_D} \\right)$$\nThe $R_{\\text{tot}}$ terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out, yielding the final expression for fractional occupancy:\n$$f = \\frac{D}{D + K_D}$$\nThis is the Hill-Langmuir equation. It is a dimensionless quantity, as $D$ and $K_D$ both have units of concentration. The expression gives the fractional occupancy as a hyperbolic function of the free drug concentration $D$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{D}{K_D + D}}\n$$", "id": "4381694"}, {"introduction": "A key insight from QSP is that a drug's dynamic behavior, not just its equilibrium affinity, can determine its ultimate biological effect. This practice explores the crucial difference between two inhibitors that share an identical equilibrium dissociation constant ($K_d$) but have different kinetic residence times.

In the absence of any inhibitor, the system is at a steady state with a total target concentration of $T_0$.\n\nTwo different competitive inhibitors, Inhibitor A and Inhibitor B, are developed to block the function of this target. Both inhibitors exhibit the same equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$. However, they possess different binding kinetics. Inhibitor A is a slow-dissociating inhibitor with a dissociation rate constant $k_s$, while Inhibitor B is a fast-dissociating inhibitor with a dissociation rate constant $k_f$, where $k_f > k_s$. The corresponding association rate constants are $k_{on,A}$ and $k_{on,B}$. The inhibitor-target complex, $[C]$, consists of one inhibitor molecule and one target protein molecule, and is also subject to degradation with the same rate constant $k_{deg}$.\n\nTo compare the overall efficacy of these inhibitors in a dynamic cellular context, a washout experiment is performed. First, the cell population is incubated with a saturating concentration of either Inhibitor A or Inhibitor B until a new steady state is reached. At time $t=0$, the free inhibitor is instantaneously and completely removed from the system, and the concentration of free target, $[T(t)]$, is monitored as it recovers back to its original drug-free steady-state level, $T_0$.\n\nA key metric in Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) to quantify the total impact of the inhibitor during the recovery phase is the integrated recovery deficit, $\\mathcal{J}$.

The analysis is based on a simplified, linear, perfusion-limited Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for a drug administered via constant intravenous infusion.\n\nThe core of the solution lies in the steady-state analysis of the system. At steady state, the rate of drug administration is balanced by the rate of total body elimination.

Since tissue blood flows are fractions of cardiac output, all tissue flows are also scaled by $s$. Specifically, the hepatic blood flow becomes a function of $s$:\n$$\nQ_{hep}(s) = s \\cdot f_{\\text{hep}} \\cdot CO_{\\text{base}}\n$$\nwhere $f_{\\text{hep}}$ is the fraction of cardiac output perfusing the liver and $CO_{\\text{base}}$ is the baseline cardiac output.

Then, for each scaling factor $s$ in the test suite $[1.0, 0.5, 1.5, 0.1, 3.0]$, we calculate the corresponding $CL_{tot}(s)$ and compute the ratio $r(s) = CL_{tot}(1.0) / CL_{tot}(s)$.

The final output aggregates these three identical values for each $s$ in the specified order.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Implements a simplified PBPK model to evaluate how altered cardiac output\n    affects steady-state drug levels.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Model parameters as defined in the problem statement\n    CO_base = 300.0  # L/h\n    f_hep = 0.25     # dimensionless\n    CL_int = 300.0   # L/h\n    f_u = 0.1        # dimensionless\n    CL_r = 5.0       # L/h\n    \n    # Test suite of cardiac output scaling factors\n    scaling_factors = [1.0, 0.5, 1.5, 0.1, 3.0]\n    \n    results = []\n\n    def get_total_clearance(s: float) - float:\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the total body clearance for a given cardiac output scaling factor 's'.\n        \n        Args:\n            s: The dimensionless scaling factor for cardiac output.\n            \n        Returns:\n            The total clearance in L/h.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Calculate scaled hepatic blood flow\n        q_hep = s * f_hep * CO_base\n        \n        # Calculate hepatic clearance using the well-stirred model.\n        # The product f_u * CL_int is a constant.\n        fu_cl_int = f_u * CL_int\n        cl_h = q_hep * fu_cl_int / (q_hep + fu_cl_int)\n        \n        # Total clearance is the sum of renal and hepatic clearances\n        total_cl = CL_r + cl_h\n        return total_cl\n\n    # Calculate the baseline total clearance for s=1.0, which serves as the reference\n    baseline_total_cl = get_total_clearance(1.0)\n    \n    # Iterate through each scaling factor in the test suite\n    for s_val in scaling_factors:\n        # Calculate the total clearance for the current scaling factor\n        current_total_cl = get_total_clearance(s_val)\n        \n        # As derived, the ratios for AUC, C_hep, and C_mus are identical and\n        # equal to the inverse ratio of the total clearances.\n        # ratio = C_p,ss(s) / C_p,ss(1.0) = CL_tot(1.0) / CL_tot(s)\n        ratio = baseline_total_cl / current_total_cl\n        \n        # For each s, append the ratio three times as required for r_AUC, r_hep, and r_mus\n        results.extend([ratio, ratio, ratio])\n        \n    # Format the final output as a single-line comma-separated list in brackets\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "4381697"}]}
