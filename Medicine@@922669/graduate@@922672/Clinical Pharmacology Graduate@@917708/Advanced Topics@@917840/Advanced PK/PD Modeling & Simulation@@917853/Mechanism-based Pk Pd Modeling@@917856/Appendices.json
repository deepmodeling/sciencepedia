It is a scientifically sound, self-consistent, and well-posed problem from the field of pharmacokinetics. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe amount of drug in the body, $A(t)$, at a given time $t$ in a one-compartment model is related to its concentration, $C(t)$, by the volume of distribution, $V$:\n$$A(t) = V \\cdot C(t)$$\nThe rate of change of the amount of drug in the body is described by the mass-balance equation. Since the drug is only being eliminated, the rate of change is equal to the negative of the rate of elimination:\n$$\\frac{dA}{dt} = -(\\text{Rate of elimination})$$\nThe problem states that elimination follows the Michaelis–Menten rate law. The rate of elimination in terms of mass per unit time is given by:\n$$\\text{Rate of elimination} = \\frac{V_{\\max} \\cdot C}{K_m + C}$$\nwhere $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum rate of elimination (in mg/h) and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant (in mg/L).\n\nSubstituting the Michaelis-Menten expression into the mass-balance equation gives:\n$$\\frac{dA}{dt} = - \\frac{V_{\\max} \\cdot C}{K_m + C}$$\nTo express this equation in terms of concentration $C$, we differentiate the relationship $A = VC$ with respect to time $t$. Since $V$ is constant, we have $\\frac{dA}{dt} = V \\frac{dC}{dt}$.\nSubstituting this into the rate equation gives the differential equation for the concentration of the drug:\n$$V \\frac{dC}{dt} = - \\frac{V_{\\max} \\cdot C}{K_m + C}$$\nThis is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation. We can separate the variables $C$ and $t$ to solve it:\n$$\\frac{K_m + C}{C} dC = -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V} dt$$\nSimplifying the left-hand side yields:\n$$\\left(\\frac{K_m}{C} + 1\\right) dC = -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V} dt$$\nTo find the time $t$ required for the concentration to fall from an initial value $C_0$ at $t=0$ to a target value $C_1$ at time $t$, we integrate both sides of the equation over these limits:\n$$\\int_{C_0}^{C_1} \\left(\\frac{K_m}{C} + 1\\right) dC = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V} d\\tau$$\nEvaluating the integral on the left-hand side:\n$$\\int_{C_0}^{C_1} \\left(\\frac{K_m}{C} + 1\\right) dC = \\left[ K_m \\ln|C| + C \\right]_{C_0}^{C_1}$$\nSince concentration is a positive quantity, we can omit the absolute value signs:\n$$[K_m \\ln(C) + C]_{C_0}^{C_1} = (K_m \\ln(C_1) + C_1) - (K_m \\ln(C_0) + C_0) = K_m \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_1}{C_0}\\right) + (C_1 - C_0)$$\nEvaluating the integral on the right-hand side:\n$$\\int_{0}^{t} -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V} d\\tau = -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V} [\\tau]_0^t = -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V} t$$\nEquating the two results:\n$$K_m \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_1}{C_0}\\right) + (C_1 - C_0) = -\\frac{V_{\\max}}{V} t$$\nWe now solve for the elapsed time $t$:\n$$t = -\\frac{V}{V_{\\max}} \\left( K_m \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_1}{C_0}\\right) + (C_1 - C_0) \\right)$$\nUsing the logarithmic property $\\ln(x/y) = -\\ln(y/x)$, we can rewrite the expression in a more convenient form:\n$$t = \\frac{V}{V_{\\max}} \\left( K_m \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_0}{C_1}\\right) + (C_0 - C_1) \\right)$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the time required for the drug concentration to decrease from $C_0$ to $C_1$.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression:\n$V = 20$ L\n$V_{\\max} = 50$ mg/h\n$K_m = 2$ mg/L\n$C_0 = 5$ mg/L\n$C_1 = 2$ mg/L\n\n$$t = \\frac{20}{50} \\left( 2 \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) + (5 - 2) \\right)$$\n$$t = 0.4 \\left( 2 \\ln(2.5) + 3 \\right)$$\nFirst, we calculate the value of $\\ln(2.5)$:\n$$\\ln(2.5) \\approx 0.9162907$$\nNow we substitute this value back into the equation for $t$:\n$$t \\approx 0.4 \\left( 2 \\cdot (0.9162907) + 3 \\right)$$\n$$t \\approx 0.4 \\left( 1.8325814 + 3 \\right)$$\n$$t \\approx 0.4 \\left( 4.8325814 \\right)$$\n$$t \\approx 1.93303256 \\text{ hours}$$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$t \\approx 1.933 \\text{ hours}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.933}$$", "id": "4565179"}, {"introduction": "After understanding drug concentration profiles, the next step is to link concentration to effect.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution: first, the derivation of the relationship between effect and concentration, and second, the calculation of the specific concentration required to achieve an $80\\%$ maximal effect.\n\n#### Part 1: Derivation of the Functional Relationship\n\nWe begin with the law of mass action for the reversible binding of a drug (agonist) $D$ to a receptor $R$. The problem states that cooperativity is summarized by the Hill coefficient $n$. This can be represented by the reaction:\n$$ nD + R \\rightleftharpoons D_nR $$\nwhere $D_nR$ is the drug-receptor complex. At equilibrium, the dissociation constant, which we denote here as $K_A^n$ to match the form related to $EC_{50}$, is given by:\n$$ K_A^n = \\frac{[D]^n [R]}{[D_nR]} $$\nLet $C$ be the concentration of the free drug, so $[D] = C$.\n$$ K_A^n = \\frac{C^n [R]}{[D_nR]} $$\nThe total receptor concentration, $R_{tot}$, is the sum of free receptors $[R]$ and occupied receptors $[D_nR]$:\n$$ R_{tot} = [R] + [D_nR] $$\nThe fractional receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, is the ratio of occupied receptors to the total number of receptors:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[D_nR]}{R_{tot}} = \\frac{[D_nR]}{[R] + [D_nR]} $$\nTo express $\\theta$ as a function of $C$, we first rearrange the dissociation constant expression to solve for $[R]$:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_A^n [D_nR]}{C^n} $$\nSubstitute this into the denominator of the expression for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[D_nR]}{\\frac{K_A^n [D_nR]}{C^n} + [D_nR]} $$\nFactoring out $[D_nR]$ from the denominator, we get:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[D_nR]}{[D_nR] \\left( \\frac{K_A^n}{C^n} + 1 \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_A^n}{C^n} + 1} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $C^n$ yields the final form for fractional occupancy:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{C^n}{K_A^n + C^n} $$\nThe problem states there is a linear transduction from receptor occupancy to effect. This implies that the effect $E$ is directly proportional to the fractional occupancy $\\theta$. The maximal effect $E_{\\max}$ is achieved when occupancy is complete ($\\theta = 1$). Thus:\n$$ E = E_{\\max} \\cdot \\theta $$\nThis gives the relationship for the fractional effect:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\theta = \\frac{C^n}{K_A^n + C^n} $$\nNext, we use the definition of $EC_{50}$. $EC_{50}$ is the concentration $C$ at which the effect is half of its maximum, i.e., $E = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\max}$. This corresponds to a fractional effect of $\\frac{1}{2}$. Setting $C=EC_{50}$ and $E/E_{\\max} = 1/2$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{(EC_{50})^n}{K_A^n + (EC_{50})^n} $$\nSolving for $K_A^n$:\n$$ K_A^n + (EC_{50})^n = 2 (EC_{50})^n $$\n$$ K_A^n = (EC_{50})^n $$\nThis result connects the mechanistic dissociation constant to the empirical parameter $EC_{50}$. Substituting $K_A^n = (EC_{50})^n$ back into the fractional effect equation gives the required functional relationship, known as the Sigmoid Emax model or the Hill equation:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{C^n}{(EC_{50})^n + C^n} $$\n\n#### Part 2: Calculation of the Concentration\n\nWe are asked to find the concentration $C$ that produces an effect equal to $0.8\\,E_{\\max}$. This means the fractional effect $E/E_{\\max}$ is $0.8$. We use the derived equation with the given numerical values for the parameters.\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = 0.8 $$\nSubstituting this into the Hill equation:\n$$ 0.8 = \\frac{C^n}{(EC_{50})^n + C^n} $$\nWe now solve for $C$. Let $EC_{50} = 2$ mg/L and $n=1.5$.\n$$ 0.8 ((EC_{50})^n + C^n) = C^n $$\n$$ 0.8(EC_{50})^n + 0.8C^n = C^n $$\n$$ 0.8(EC_{50})^n = C^n - 0.8C^n $$\n$$ 0.8(EC_{50})^n = 0.2C^n $$\nTo solve for $C$, we first isolate the term $C^n$:\n$$ C^n = \\frac{0.8}{0.2} (EC_{50})^n = 4(EC_{50})^n $$\nWe can rewrite this as:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{C}{EC_{50}} \\right)^n = 4 $$\nNow, take the $n$-th root of both sides:\n$$ \\frac{C}{EC_{50}} = 4^{\\frac{1}{n}} $$\n$$ C = EC_{50} \\cdot 4^{\\frac{1}{n}} $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values $EC_{50} = 2$ and $n = 1.5$:\n$$ C = 2 \\cdot 4^{\\frac{1}{1.5}} $$\nSince $1.5 = \\frac{3}{2}$, its reciprocal is $\\frac{1}{1.5} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n$$ C = 2 \\cdot 4^{\\frac{2}{3}} $$\nThis can be calculated as:\n$$ C = 2 \\cdot (4^2)^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 2 \\cdot 16^{\\frac{1}{3}} $$\n$$ C = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{16} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ C \\approx 2 \\cdot (2.519842) $$\n$$ C \\approx 5.039684 $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ C \\approx 5.040 $$\nThe units for concentration are mg/L, as given for $EC_{50}$.\nThe final concentration required is $5.040$ mg/L.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{5.040}\n$$", "id": "4565173"}, {"introduction": "Real-world drug effects are often not direct but are mediated through complex physiological pathways.
