This process is a scaling exercise, translating a specific metabolic rate measured in a subcellular fraction to the total metabolic capacity of the entire organ.\n\nThe fundamental principle is that the total clearance capacity of the liver is the product of the specific clearance rate per unit of metabolic \"machinery\" (microsomal protein) and the total amount of that \"machinery\" within the entire organ.\n\nLet us define the given parameters:\n- Unbound microsomal intrinsic clearance: $CL_{\\text{int,u,mic}} = 6.2\\ \\mu\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$\n- Body weight of the subject: $BW = 80\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- Liver mass fraction of body weight: $f_{LW} = 0.026$\n- Microsomal protein per gram of liver: $MPPGL = 45\\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$\n- System-specific scaling factor: $SF = 1.0$ (dimensionless)\n\nFirst, we must determine the total mass of the liver ($LW$). As stipulated, the liver weight is a specific fraction of the total body weight. The expression is:\n$$LW = BW \\times f_{LW}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$LW = 80\\ \\mathrm{kg} \\times 0.026 = 2.08\\ \\mathrm{kg}$$\n\nThe parameter $MPPGL$ is given in units of milligrams of microsomal protein per gram of liver. Therefore, we must convert the liver weight from kilograms to grams. Using the conversion factor $1\\ \\mathrm{kg} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{g}$, we get:\n$$LW_{\\mathrm{g}} = 2.08\\ \\mathrm{kg} \\times \\frac{1000\\ \\mathrm{g}}{1\\ \\mathrm{kg}} = 2080\\ \\mathrm{g}$$\n\nNext, we establish the total amount of microsomal protein in the entire liver ($MP_{\\text{total}}$). This is found by multiplying the microsomal protein density ($MPPGL$) by the total liver mass in grams ($LW_{\\mathrm{g}}$).\n$$MP_{\\text{total}} = MPPGL \\times LW_{\\mathrm{g}}$$\n\nThe whole-liver unbound intrinsic clearance, $CL_{\\text{int,u,liver}}$, is the rate of metabolism for the entire organ. It is derived by scaling the specific activity, $CL_{\\text{int,u,mic}}$ (which has units of volume per time per milligram of protein), by the total amount of microsomal protein in the liver, $MP_{\\text{total}}$. The scaling factor $SF$ is also included to account for any systematic differences between in vitro and in vivo conditions.\nThe derived expression is therefore:\n$$CL_{\\text{int,u,liver}} = CL_{\\text{int,u,mic}} \\times MP_{\\text{total}} \\times SF$$\nSubstituting the expression for $MP_{\\text{total}}$, we obtain the full expression based on the initial givens:\n$$CL_{\\text{int,u,liver}} = CL_{\\text{int,u,mic}} \\times (MPPGL \\times LW_{\\mathrm{g}}) \\times SF$$\nFurther substituting the expression for $LW_{\\mathrm{g}}$:\n$$CL_{\\text{int,u,liver}} = CL_{\\text{int,u,mic}} \\times MPPGL \\times (BW \\times f_{LW}) \\times SF$$\nThis expression demonstrates dimensional consistency.

Its total mass is the primary determinant of the organ's overall capacity. Using a fraction of body weight ($f_{LW} = 0.026$) is a standard allometric approach to estimate organ size based on well-established physiological data for healthy adults.\n- **Microsomal Protein per Gram Liver ($MPPGL$)**: Metabolism occurs via enzymes located in the endoplasmic reticulum, which are isolated as microsomes in vitro. The $MPPGL$ value ($45\\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$) quantifies the abundance of this metabolic machinery per unit of liver tissue. It is a critical scaler that connects organ mass to the biochemical component responsible for clearance.\n- **System-Specific Scaling Factor ($SF$)**: This dimensionless factor ($SF=1.0$) is a formal acknowledgment that in vitro systems are simplifications. It serves as a correction term for unmodeled biological phenomena (e.g., differences in cofactor availability, membrane-bound effects) that might cause the direct scaling to be inaccurate. A value of $1.0$ implies that for this specific drug and assay, the in vitro activity is assumed to translate directly to in vivo activity without further empirical adjustment.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $CL_{\\text{int,u,liver}}$.\n$$CL_{\\text{int,u,liver}} = \\left( 6.2\\ \\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{min} \\cdot \\mathrm{mg}} \\right) \\times \\left( 45\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{g}} \\right) \\times (2080\\ \\mathrm{g}) \\times 1.0$$\n$$CL_{\\text{int,u,liver}} = (6.2 \\times 45 \\times 2080)\\ \\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{min}}$$\n$$CL_{\\text{int,u,liver}} = 580320\\ \\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{min}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer in units of liters per hour ($\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$).

The relationship is given by:\n$$AUC = \\frac{Dose}{CL_{sys}}$$\nThe $AUCR$ is the ratio of the $AUC$ in the presence of an inhibitor drug ($AUC_{I}$) to the $AUC$ in its absence (baseline, $AUC_{0}$). Assuming the dose of the victim drug is the same in both scenarios:\n$$AUCR = \\frac{AUC_{I}}{AUC_{0}} = \\frac{Dose/CL_{sys,I}}{Dose/CL_{sys,0}} = \\frac{CL_{sys,0}}{CL_{sys,I}}$$\nwhere $CL_{sys,0}$ and $CL_{sys,I}$ are the total systemic clearances at baseline and in the presence of the inhibitor, respectively.\n\nThe total systemic clearance is the sum of all parallel elimination pathways. The problem specifies two components: a single metabolic hepatic pathway that is subject to inhibition, and all other remaining elimination pathways which are not. Let $CL_{H}$ be the hepatic clearance and $CL_{other}$ be the clearance from all other pathways.\n$$CL_{sys} = CL_{H} + CL_{other}$$\nThe fraction metabolized, $f_{m}$, is the fraction of total elimination that occurs via the specified hepatic pathway. Therefore, at baseline:\n$$f_{m} = \\frac{CL_{H,0}}{CL_{sys,0}} \\quad \\implies \\quad CL_{H,0} = f_{m} \\cdot CL_{sys,0}$$\nAnd consequently, the clearance by other pathways is:\n$$CL_{other} = CL_{sys,0} - CL_{H,0} = (1 - f_{m}) \\cdot CL_{sys,0}$$\nThe perpetrator drug is a competitive inhibitor. For competitive inhibition, under the assumption of linear pharmacokinetics (i.e., substrate concentration is much less than the Michaelis-Menten constant, $K_m$), the intrinsic clearance ($CL_{int}$) is inhibited according to the equation:\n$$CL_{int,I} = \\frac{CL_{int,0}}{1 + \\frac{I_{u}}{K_{i}}}$$\nwhere $CL_{int,0}$ is the baseline intrinsic clearance, $I_{u}$ is the unbound concentration of the inhibitor at the enzyme active site, and $K_{i}$ is the inhibition constant.\n\nIn the well-stirred liver model, hepatic clearance ($CL_H$) is a function of liver blood flow ($Q_H$), fraction unbound in blood ($f_{u,b}$), and intrinsic clearance ($CL_{int}$). For drugs with low hepatic extraction, $CL_H$ is approximately proportional to the intrinsic clearance ($CL_{H} \\approx f_{u,b} \\cdot CL_{int}$). Thus, the inhibition of $CL_{int}$ translates directly to the inhibition of $CL_{H}$:\n$$CL_{H,I} = \\frac{CL_{H,0}}{1 + \\frac{I_{u}}{K_{i}}}$$\nThe clearance by other pathways, $CL_{other}$, is unaffected by the inhibitor. The total systemic clearance in the presence of the inhibitor, $CL_{sys,I}$, is:\n$$CL_{sys,I} = CL_{H,I} + CL_{other} = \\frac{CL_{H,0}}{1 + \\frac{I_{u}}{K_{i}}} + CL_{other}$$\nSubstituting the baseline relationships involving $f_{m}$:\n$$CL_{sys,I} = \\frac{f_{m} \\cdot CL_{sys,0}}{1 + \\frac{I_{u}}{K_{i}}} + (1 - f_{m}) \\cdot CL_{sys,0}$$\nNow, we can derive the expression for $AUCR$:\n$$AUCR = \\frac{CL_{sys,0}}{CL_{sys,I}} = \\frac{CL_{sys,0}}{ \\frac{f_{m} \\cdot CL_{sys,0}}{1 + \\frac{I_{u}}{K_{i}}} + (1 - f_{m}) \\cdot CL_{sys,0} }$$\nFactoring out $CL_{sys,0}$ from the denominator and canceling terms yields the final expression:\n$$AUCR = \\frac{1}{\\frac{f_{m}}{1 + \\frac{I_{u}}{K_{i}}} + (1 - f_{m})}$$\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the threshold $I_{u}/K_{i}$ ratio\n\nA clinically meaningful DDI is defined as an interaction producing an $AUCR \\geq 1.25$. We are given $f_{m} = 0.60$. We need to find the minimum value of the ratio $I_{u}/K_{i}$ for which $AUCR = 1.25$.\nSetting $AUCR = 1.25$ and $f_{m} = 0.60$ in the derived expression:\n$$1.25 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.60}{1 + \\frac{I_{u}}{K_{i}}} + (1 - 0.60)}$$\n$$1.25 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.60}{1 + \\frac{I_{u}}{K_{i}}} + 0.40}$$\nTo solve for the ratio $I_{u}/K_{i}$, we can rearrange the equation:\n$$\\frac{0.60}{1 + \\frac{I_{u}}{K_{i}}} + 0.40 = \\frac{1}{1.25} = 0.80$$\n$$\\frac{0.60}{1 + \\frac{I_{u}}{K_{i}}} = 0.80 - 0.40 = 0.40$$\n$$0.60 = 0.40 \\left(1 + \\frac{I_{u}}{K_{i}}\\right)$$\n$$1 + \\frac{I_{u}}{K_{i}} = \\frac{0.60}{0.40} = 1.5$$\n$$\\frac{I_{u}}{K_{i}} = 1.5 - 1 = 0.5$$\nThe minimum threshold value of $I_{u}/K_{i}$ is $0.5$. The problem requires this to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, which is $0.5000$.\n\nPart 3: PBPK reasoning on the $I_{u}/K_{i}$ ratio\n\nThe accuracy of predicting a DDI using the $I_{u}/K_{i}$ ratio is highly dependent on the accurate determination of both $I_{u}$ and $K_{i}$. Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling provides the framework to account for the complex biological processes that influence these parameters.\n\nInfluence on $I_{u}$ (Unbound Inhibitor Concentration at the Enzyme Site):\nThe relevant concentration, $I_{u}$, is the unbound concentration within the hepatocyte where the cytochrome P450 enzymes reside. However, drug concentrations are typically measured in plasma ($C_p$). PBPK models are crucial for relating the measurable total plasma concentration to the unmeasurable intracellular unbound concentration.\n$1$. **Plasma Protein Binding:** Only the unbound drug in plasma is free to diffuse into tissues. The unbound plasma concentration ($C_{p,u}$) is related to the total plasma concentration ($C_{p,total}$) by the fraction unbound in plasma, $f_{u,p}$: $C_{p,u} = f_{u,p} \\cdot C_{p,total}$.\n$2$. **Tissue Partitioning:** The unbound drug must then cross the hepatocyte membrane to reach the enzyme. The relationship between the unbound concentration in plasma and in the tissue is not always one-to-one. PBPK models use tissue-to-plasma partition coefficients to describe this distribution. The unbound tissue-to-unbound plasma partition coefficient, $K_{p,uu}$, accounts for both passive diffusion and active transport processes. The unbound intracellular concentration is given by $I_{u} = K_{p,uu} \\cdot C_{p,u}$. If active uptake transporters carry the inhibitor into the hepatocyte, $K_{p,uu} > 1$ and $I_u$ can be significantly higher than the unbound plasma concentration. Conversely, if active efflux transporters pump the inhibitor out, $K_{p,uu} < 1$. A simple assumption of $K_{p,uu}=1$ may lead to significant under- or over-prediction of the DDI risk.\n\nInfluence on $K_{i}$ (Inhibitory Constant):\nThe inhibitory constant, $K_{i}$, is a measure of the inhibitor's binding affinity for the enzyme. It is typically determined from *in vitro* experiments, such as with human liver microsomes (HLM) or recombinant enzyme systems.\n$1$. **Nonspecific Binding in vitro:** The inhibitor can bind nonspecifically to proteins and lipids within the *in vitro* assay system (e.g., the microsomal membrane). This reduces the actual unbound concentration of the inhibitor available to bind to the enzyme. The measured $K_i$ is therefore an apparent value ($K_{i,app}$) based on the nominal concentration added. The true, pharmacologically relevant constant is the unbound one, $K_{i,u}$, which is related to the apparent value by the fraction unbound in the incubation, $f_{u,inc}$: $K_{i,u} = K_{i,app} \\cdot f_{u,inc}$. To accurately assess the DDI potential, the *in vivo* ratio should be $I_{u}/K_{i,u}$. Using an apparent $K_i$ without correcting for nonspecific binding introduces a systematic error, typically leading to an overestimation of $K_{i}$ and thus an underestimation of the DDI risk.\n\nIn summary, PBPK reasoning highlights that the simple ratio $I_{u}/K_{i}$ masks significant biological complexity. An accurate DDI assessment requires a PBPK model that integrates data on plasma protein binding ($f_{u,p}$), tissue partitioning ($K_{p,uu}$ describing active transport), and *in vitro* binding ($f_{u,inc}$) to correctly estimate the unbound inhibitor concentration at the enzyme active site ($I_u$) and use it with a properly determined unbound inhibitory constant ($K_{i,u}$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5000}\n$$", "id": "4571505"}, {"introduction": "A powerful model is one whose behavior is well understood.

Any change in $CL_{int}$ or $f_u$ will therefore have a proportional effect on the fraction of drug extracted.\n\n2.  High Extraction regime ($f_u \\cdot CL_{int} \\gg Q_h$):\nIn this case, the denominator of the sensitivity expressions is dominated by $f_u \\cdot CL_{int}$.\n$$S_{CL_{int}} = S_{f_u} = \\frac{Q_h}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}} \\approx \\frac{Q_h}{f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}$$\nSince $f_u \\cdot CL_{int} \\gg Q_h$, this ratio approaches zero.\n$$S_{CL_{int}} \\to 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad S_{f_u} \\to 0$$\nA sensitivity near zero implies that $E_h$ is nearly independent of $f_u$ and $CL_{int}$. For the underlying expression, $E_h \\approx \\frac{f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}{f_u \\cdot CL_{int}} = 1$. Mechanistically, when intrinsic clearance is very high, the liver has an immense capacity to eliminate the drug. The rate-limiting step becomes the rate at which the drug is delivered to the liver, which is determined by hepatic blood flow, $Q_h$. The extraction ratio $E_h$ approaches its theoretical maximum of $1$. Since $E_h$ is already saturated at its maximum, further increases in metabolic capacity ($CL_{int}$) or the unbound fraction ($f_u$) can have very little additional effect. The clearance is said to be \"perfusion-limited\" or \"flow-limited\".", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{Q_h}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}} & \\frac{Q_h}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4571471"}]}
