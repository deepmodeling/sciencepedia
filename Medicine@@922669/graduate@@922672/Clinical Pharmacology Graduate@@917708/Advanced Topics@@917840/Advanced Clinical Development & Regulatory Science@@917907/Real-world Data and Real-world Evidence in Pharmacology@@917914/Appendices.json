This exercise guides you through the process of creating a computable phenotype, a set of precise, algorithmic rules that translate a clinical concept like \"new statin user\" into a machine-readable definition. Mastering this skill [@problem_id:4587684] is essential for ensuring your study population is correctly specified, forming the bedrock of any valid observational study.", "problem": "You are given longitudinal prescription fill records drawn from Real-World Data (RWD) in clinical pharmacology and are asked to construct a computable phenotype for new-use of a statin using World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes. The output must be computed solely from the provided data and constants. You must implement a program that, for each test case, determines whether there exists at least one valid cohort entry (index fill) that satisfies all of the following rules simultaneously:\n\n1. The index fill belongs to the statin class, identified by ATC codes beginning with the prefix `C10AA` (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors).\n2. The index fill has a minimum supply duration of at least $D_{\\min} = 30$ days, where days are counted in whole-day units.\n3. The average daily dose of the index fill, defined as the total dispensed amount divided by the days of supply, is at or above the ingredient-specific dose threshold. The average daily dose $\\delta$ must be computed as $$\\delta = \\frac{s \\cdot q}{d}$$, where $s$ is strength in $\\mathrm{mg}$ per unit, $q$ is the number of units dispensed, and $d$ is the recorded days of supply (in days). The dose thresholds (in $\\mathrm{mg/day}$) are:\n   - Atorvastatin (`C10AA05`): threshold 10,\n   - Rosuvastatin (`C10AA07`): threshold 5,\n   - Simvastatin (`C10AA01`): threshold 20,\n   - Pravastatin (`C10AA03`): threshold 40.\n4. A washout period of $W = 180$ days must precede the index fill. Washout means the interval $[t_{\\mathrm{index}} - W, t_{\\mathrm{index}} - 1]$ contains no statin exposure coverage from any earlier fill. Coverage for a fill beginning at day $t_i$ with $d_i$ days of supply is the closed interval $[t_i, t_i + d_i - 1]$ in units of days. Any overlap between this coverage interval and the washout interval invalidates the candidate index fill. Washout applies to any statin exposure regardless of dose or days of supply. Non-statin fills (ATC codes not starting with `C10AA`) do not contribute to washout.\n\nAdditional specifications:\n- All dates $t$ are represented as integer day offsets from a nominal cohort start; there is no calendar logic beyond integer arithmetic. All dose computations must be in $\\mathrm{mg/day}$. All durations must be in days.\n- If there is no fill meeting the minimum supply and dose threshold rules, the result for that test case is $False$. If there is at least one fill that meets rules $1$–$3$ and also satisfies the washout rule $4$, the result for that test case is $True$. If an earlier candidate fails washout, later candidates may still qualify provided they satisfy all rules relative to exposures strictly earlier than their own dispense date.\n- RxNorm is permitted in principle, but in these test cases ATC codes are used exclusively.\n\nYour program must process the following test suite, where each test case is a list of tuples $(p, t, c_s, c, s, q, d)$ with patient identifier $p$, dispense day $t$ (integer days), code system $c_s$, ATC code $c$, strength per unit $s$ in $\\mathrm{mg}$, quantity $q$ in units (e.g., tablets), and days of supply $d$ in days.\n\nConstants for all test cases:\n- Washout window length $W = 180$ days.\n- Minimum supply duration $D_{\\min} = 30$ days.\n- Dose thresholds in $\\mathrm{mg/day}$: atorvastatin ($10$), rosuvastatin ($5$), simvastatin ($20$), pravastatin ($40$).\n\nTest cases:\n\n- Case $1$ (happy path, new-use qualifies):\n  - $[(1, 200, \\text{\"ATC\"}, \\text{\"C10AA05\"}, 20, 30, 30)]$.\n\n- Case $2$ (washout violated by prior statin coverage):\n  - $[(2, 50, \\text{\"ATC\"}, \\text{\"C10AA01\"}, 20, 30, 30), (2, 200, \\text{\"ATC\"}, \\text{\"C10AA05\"}, 20, 30, 30)]$.\n\n- Case $3$ (minimum supply not met):\n  - $[(3, 100, \\text{\"ATC\"}, \\text{\"C10AA07\"}, 10, 14, 14)]$.\n\n- Case $4$ (dose exactly at threshold qualifies):\n  - $[(4, 500, \\text{\"ATC\"}, \\text{\"C10AA01\"}, 20, 30, 30)]$.\n\n- Case $5$ (prior non-statin exposure ignored; statin qualifies):\n  - $[(5, 10, \\text{\"ATC\"}, \\text{\"C10AB04\"}, 600, 60, 30), (5, 200, \\text{\"ATC\"}, \\text{\"C10AA03\"}, 40, 30, 30)]$.\n\n- Case $6$ (earlier low-dose statin breaks washout for later candidate):\n  - $[(6, 400, \\text{\"ATC\"}, \\text{\"C10AA05\"}, 10, 30, 60), (6, 500, \\text{\"ATC\"}, \\text{\"C10AA05\"}, 20, 30, 30)]$.\n\n- Case $7$ (boundary: last coverage ends at $t_{\\mathrm{index}} - W$, fails washout):\n  - $[(7, 200, \\text{\"ATC\"}, \\text{\"C10AA01\"}, 20, 21, 21), (7, 400, \\text{\"ATC\"}, \\text{\"C10AA07\"}, 10, 30, 30)]$.\n\n- Case $8$ (boundary: last coverage ends at $t_{\\mathrm{index}} - W - 1$, passes washout):\n  - $[(8, 200, \\text{\"ATC\"}, \\text{\"C10AA01\"}, 20, 20, 20), (8, 400, \\text{\"ATC\"}, \\text{\"C10AA07\"}, 10, 30, 30)]$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., $[\\text{result}_1,\\text{result}_2,\\dots]$), where each $\\text{result}_i$ is a boolean indicating whether the phenotype criteria are met for the corresponding test case in the order listed above.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is determined to be sound. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical pharmacology and pharmacoepidemiology, is well-posed, and is formulated with objective, formalizable criteria. The problem asks for the implementation of a computable phenotype for new statin use based on a set of precise rules applied to longitudinal prescription data.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine, for a given patient's prescription history, if there exists at least one prescription fill that can serve as a valid \"index fill\" signifying new use of a statin. The solution requires a systematic evaluation of each prescription record against a sequence of four rules.\n\nThe design of the algorithm is based on the following principles:\n\n1.  **Phenotype Rule Formalization**: A computable phenotype is defined by a set of unambiguous, machine-executable rules. The four rules provided are formalized as follows:\n    *   **Rule 1 (Statin Class)**: The prescription must be for a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (a statin). This is identified by its Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code, $c$, which must have the prefix `C10AA`. This is a string-matching condition.\n    *   **Rule 2 (Supply Duration)**: The treatment duration must be substantive. The days of supply, $d$, for the fill must be at least $D_{\\min} = 30$ days. This is a simple inequality: $d \\ge 30$.\n    *   **Rule 3 (Dose Threshold)**: The fill must represent a therapeutic dose, not a sub-therapeutic or tapering dose. The average daily dose, $\\delta$, is calculated as $$ \\delta = \\frac{s \\cdot q}{d} $$ where $s$ is the strength per unit (in $\\mathrm{mg}$), $q$ is the quantity of units, and $d$ is the days of supply. This calculated dose $\\delta$ must be greater than or equal to a pre-specified threshold, $\\delta_{\\text{threshold}}$, which is specific to the drug ingredient. The problem provides thresholds for four statins: Atorvastatin (`C10AA05`, $\\delta_{\\text{threshold}} = 10$ mg/day), Rosuvastatin (`C10AA07`, $\\delta_{\\text{threshold}} = 5$ mg/day), Simvastatin (`C10AA01`, $\\delta_{\\text{threshold}} = 20$ mg/day), and Pravastatin (`C10AA03`, $\\delta_{\\text{threshold}} = 40$ mg/day).\n    *   **Rule 4 (Washout Period)**: To qualify as \"new use,\" the patient must have been free of statin therapy for a defined period before the index fill. A washout period of $W = 180$ days is required. For a candidate index fill at dispense day $t_{\\text{index}}$, the washout interval is defined as the closed interval $I_W = [t_{\\text{index}} - W, t_{\\text{index}} - 1]$, or $[t_{\\text{index}} - 180, t_{\\text{index}} - 1]$. This interval must be devoid of exposure from any prior statin fill. The exposure coverage for any prior fill dispensed at $t_i$ with a supply of $d_i$ days is the closed interval $I_{C,i} = [t_i, t_i + d_i - 1]$. The washout rule is violated if, for any prior statin fill $i$, the intersection of its coverage interval and the washout interval is non-empty: $I_W \\cap I_{C,i} \\neq \\emptyset$. Two closed intervals $[a, b]$ and $[c, d]$ intersect if and only if $a \\le d$ and $c \\le b$.\n\n2.  **Iterative Candidate Evaluation**: The problem seeks the existence of *at least one* qualifying index fill. The algorithm must therefore iterate through a patient's prescription records, treating each one as a potential candidate. To ensure correct temporal evaluation for the washout rule, the records must first be sorted chronologically by dispense day, $t$. Let the sorted records be $R_0, R_1, \\dots, R_{N-1}$.\n    The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n    *   For each record $R_i$ (where $i$ ranges from $0$ to $N-1$):\n        1.  Treat $R_i$ as the `candidate_fill`.\n        2.  Check if $R_i$ satisfies the intrinsic criteria: Rule 1 (Statin Class), Rule 2 (Minimum Supply), and Rule 3 (Dose Threshold). If any of these fail, $R_i$ cannot be an index fill, and the algorithm proceeds to the next candidate, $R_{i+1}$.\n        3.  If Rules 1-3 are satisfied, evaluate Rule 4 (Washout Period). This involves checking $R_i$ against all chronologically preceding records, $R_j$ where $j  i$.\n        4.  For each prior record $R_j$:\n            *   If $R_j$ is a statin fill (satisfies Rule 1), calculate its coverage interval $I_C$.\n            *   Check if $I_C$ overlaps with the washout interval $I_W$ of $R_i$.\n            *   If an overlap is found, $R_i$ fails the washout rule. The check for this candidate is terminated, and the algorithm proceeds to $R_{i+1}$.\n        5.  If the loop over all prior records $R_j$ completes without finding any statin exposure overlap, then the `candidate_fill` $R_i$ has successfully passed all four rules.\n\n3.  **Termination Condition**:\n    *   If any candidate $R_i$ is found to satisfy all four rules, the condition \"there exists at least one valid cohort entry\" is met. The process for that patient's record set terminates, returning a result of `True`.\n    *   If the algorithm iterates through all records from $R_0$ to $R_{N-1}$ and no record satisfies all four rules, the patient does not meet the phenotype criteria. The process terminates, returning a result of `False`.\n\nThis structured, rule-based approach guarantees a deterministic and correct evaluation for each test case according to the problem's formal specification.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to process test cases for statin new-use phenotype.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define constants from the problem statement.\n    W = 180  # Washout window length in days\n    D_MIN = 30  # Minimum supply duration in days\n    DOSE_THRESHOLDS = {\n        \"C10AA05\": 10,  # Atorvastatin\n        \"C10AA07\": 5,   # Rosuvastatin\n        \"C10AA01\": 20,  # Simvastatin\n        \"C10AA03\": 40   # Pravastatin\n    }\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: happy path, new-use qualifies\n        [(1, 200, \"ATC\", \"C10AA05\", 20, 30, 30)],\n        # Case 2: washout violated by prior statin coverage for second fill, but first fill qualifies\n        [(2, 50, \"ATC\", \"C10AA01\", 20, 30, 30), (2, 200, \"ATC\", \"C10AA05\", 20, 30, 30)],\n        # Case 3: minimum supply not met\n        [(3, 100, \"ATC\", \"C10AA07\", 10, 14, 14)],\n        # Case 4: dose exactly at threshold qualifies\n        [(4, 500, \"ATC\", \"C10AA01\", 20, 30, 30)],\n        # Case 5: prior non-statin exposure ignored;

It is defined, as stated in the problem, as the difference in group means divided by a measure of the pooled standard deviation.

Before drawing causal conclusions, it is crucial to assess the robustness of your findings to such potential hidden biases. This final exercise introduces the E-value [@problem_id:4587714], a powerful sensitivity analysis tool that quantifies the minimum strength an unmeasured confounder would need to have to nullify the observed effect, thereby providing a formal measure of confidence in your generated evidence.", "problem": "A research team in clinical pharmacology uses Real-World Data (RWD) from an integrated electronic health record and claims repository to evaluate the safety of a new oral anticoagulant compared with an established comparator. In a cohort study, they estimate an observed risk ratio, denoted by $RR_{\\text{obs}}$, for a clinically meaningful bleeding outcome as $RR_{\\text{obs}} = 1.6$. They aim to assess the robustness of this Real-World Evidence (RWE) to unmeasured confounding by quantifying the minimum strength of association an unmeasured binary confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome to reduce the observed association to the null on the risk ratio scale. This quantity is known as the E-value.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of the risk ratio and confounding in epidemiology and pharmacology, consider a single binary unmeasured confounder $U$ that may influence both treatment assignment $A$ and the outcome $Y$. Let $RR_{\\text{true}}$ denote the causal risk ratio for $A$ on $Y$ that would be obtained under complete control of confounding, and suppose there is no measurement error, no selection bias, and positivity holds for $U$ in both treatment arms. Define $RR_{UY}$ as the risk ratio measuring the association between $U$ and $Y$ (within levels of $A$), and $RR_{UA}$ as the risk ratio measuring the association between $U$ and $A$.\n\nUsing only the fundamental definitions of $RR_{\\text{obs}}$, $RR_{\\text{true}}$, $RR_{UY}$, and $RR_{UA}$, and the principle that the observed risk is a mixture over strata of $U$, derive the algebraic bound on the confounding bias factor $B$ such that $RR_{\\text{obs}} = RR_{\\text{true}} \\times B$. Then, under the constraint that $RR_{UY} = RR_{UA} = x$ (the minimum equal strength across exposure and outcome), solve for the smallest $x$ that would be sufficient to make $RR_{\\text{true}} = 1$ when $RR_{\\text{obs}} = 1.6$. This $x$ is the E-value. Compute the E-value for $RR_{\\text{obs}} = 1.6$. Round your final numeric result to four significant figures and express it as a unitless quantity. Additionally, interpret in words the minimum strength of unmeasured confounding needed to explain away the observed association.", "solution": "The problem is to derive and compute the E-value for an observed risk ratio, $RR_{\\text{obs}}$, of $1.6$. The E-value quantifies the minimum strength of association that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome to fully explain the observed association, meaning to shift the true causal risk ratio, $RR_{\\text{true}}$, to the null value of $1$.\n\nFirst, let's establish the fundamental relationship between the observed risk ratio ($RR_{\\text{obs}}$), the true causal risk ratio ($RR_{\\text{true}}$), and the bias factor ($B$) due to confounding. This relationship is multiplicative on the risk ratio scale:\n$$RR_{\\text{obs}} = RR_{\\text{true}} \\times B$$\nTo reduce the observed association to the null, we set $RR_{\\text{true}} = 1$. In this scenario, the bias factor must be equal to the observed risk ratio:\n$$B = RR_{\\text{obs}}$$\n\nThe next step is to relate the bias factor $B$ to the strengths of association of the unmeasured confounder $U$ with the exposure $A$ and the outcome $Y$. Let $RR_{AU}$ be the risk ratio for the association between the confounder and the exposure, defined as $RR_{AU} = \\frac{P(A=1|U=1)}{P(A=1|U=0)}$. Let $RR_{UY}$ be the risk ratio for the association between the confounder and the outcome, defined as $RR_{UY} = \\frac{P(Y=1|U=1, A=a)}{P(Y=1|U=0, A=a)}$, assumed to be constant across levels of exposure $a$. Note that the problem's $RR_{UA}$ is interpreted as the standard $RR_{AU}$ term used in this context.\n\nFor an unmeasured confounder (with $RR_{AU} \\ge 1$ and $RR_{UY} \\ge 1$), the maximum possible bias factor $B$ it can produce is given by the bound:\n$$B \\le \\frac{RR_{AU} \\times RR_{UY}}{RR_{AU} + RR_{UY} - 1}$$\nThe E-value calculation seeks the minimum equal strength of association, so we impose the constraint $RR_{AU} = RR_{UY} = x$. Substituting this into the inequality, the maximal bias for a given strength $x$ is:\n$$B_{\\text{max}}(x) = \\frac{x \\times x}{x + x - 1} = \\frac{x^2}{2x - 1}$$\nTo explain away the observed risk ratio, this maximum possible bias must be at least as large as $RR_{\\text{obs}}$. We are interested in the minimum value of $x$ for which this is possible. Therefore, we set the maximum bias equal to the observed risk ratio:\n$$RR_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{x^2}{2x - 1}$$\nGiven $RR_{\\text{obs}} = 1.6$, we have:\n$$1.6 = \\frac{x^2}{2x - 1}$$\nWe must solve this equation for $x$. Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:\n$$1.6(2x - 1) = x^2$$\n$$3.2x - 1.6 = x^2$$\n$$x^2 - 3.2x + 1.6 = 0$$\nWe solve this equation for $x$ using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=1$, $b=-3.2$, and $c=1.6$.\n$$x = \\frac{-(-3.2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3.2)^2 - 4(1)(1.6)}}{2(1)}$$\n$$x = \\frac{3.2 \\pm \\sqrt{10.24 - 6.4}}{2}$$\n$$x = \\frac{3.2 \\pm \\sqrt{3.84}}{2}$$\nThe two possible solutions for $x$ are:\n$$x = \\frac{3.2 + \\sqrt{3.84}}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = \\frac{3.2 - \\sqrt{3.84}}{2}$$\nThe E-value is defined for risk ratios greater than $1$, which implies we are looking for a confounding strength $x \\ge 1$. The expression $\\sqrt{3.84}$ is less than $\\sqrt{4} = 2$, and is also less than $3.2$. The second root, $\\frac{3.2 - \\sqrt{3.84}}{2}$, would be less than $\\frac{3.2 - 0}{2} = 1.6$ and greater than $\\frac{3.2-2}{2} = 0.6$. The first root is clearly greater than $1$. The E-value corresponds to the larger root, which represents the strength of confounding required to create the observed association.\nThe general formula for the E-value for an observed risk ratio $RR_{\\text{obs}}  1$ is $x = RR_{\\text{obs}} + \\sqrt{RR_{\\text{obs}}(RR_{\\text{obs}} - 1)}$. Let's verify this is equivalent to the larger root of our quadratic equation:\nFrom $x^2 - (2RR_{\\text{obs}})x + RR_{\\text{obs}} = 0$, the roots are $x = \\frac{2RR_{\\text{obs}} \\pm \\sqrt{4RR_{\\text{obs}}^2 - 4RR_{\\text{obs}}}}{2} = RR_{\\text{obs}} \\pm \\sqrt{RR_{\\text{obs}}^2 - RR_{\\text{obs}}} = RR_{\\text{obs}} \\pm \\sqrt{RR_{\\text{obs}}(RR_{\\text{obs}}-1)}$. The E-value is the larger root.\nSo, for $RR_{\\text{obs}} = 1.6$:\n$$x = 1.6 + \\sqrt{1.6(1.6 - 1)}$$\n$$x = 1.6 + \\sqrt{1.6(0.6)}$$\n$$x = 1.6 + \\sqrt{0.96}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\sqrt{0.96} \\approx 0.9797959...$$\n$$x \\approx 1.6 + 0.9797959... = 2.5797959...$$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\n$$x \\approx 2.580$$\nThis value, the E-value, is $2.580$.\n\nThe interpretation is as follows: For an unmeasured confounder to fully account for the observed risk ratio of $1.6$, it would need to be associated with both the exposure (the new anticoagulant) and the outcome (bleeding) with a risk ratio of at least $2.580$ each, conditional on the measured covariates. If no such confounder exists with associations of this magnitude, the observed association is unlikely to be entirely due to confounding. Conversely, if a confounder with risk ratios of $2.580$ or greater for its associations with exposure and outcome is thought to be plausible, then the causal interpretation of the observed result is in doubt.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.580}$$", "id": "4587714"}]}
