The analysis is conducted from the health system payer perspective, with costs measured in United States dollars (USD) and effects in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The fundamental steps involve ordering the interventions by effectiveness, eliminating dominated alternatives, and then calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the remaining options.\n\nThe provided data for the three alternatives are:\n- Standard care ($A$): Cost $C_A = \\$8,000$, Effect $E_A = 0.75$ QALYs.\n- Add-on therapy ($B$): Cost $C_B = \\$12,500$, Effect $E_B = 0.80$ QALYs.\n- Alternative therapy ($C$): Cost $C_C = \\$14,000$, Effect $E_C = 0.79$ QALYs.\n\nThe process is as follows:\n\n**1. Order Alternatives by Effectiveness**\nThe first step is to order the interventions from the least effective to the most effective, based on their expected QALYs.\n- $E_A = 0.75$ QALYs\n- $E_C = 0.79$ QALYs\n- $E_B = 0.80$ QALYs\n\nThe order of increasing effectiveness is $A \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow B$. We can tabulate the alternatives in this order:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\n\\text{Alternative}  \\text{Cost } (C)  \\text{Effect } (E) \\\\\n\\hline\nA  \\$8,000  0.75 \\\\\nC  \\$14,000  0.79 \\\\\nB  \\$12,500  0.80 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n**2. Identify Dominated Alternatives**\nNext, we must check for dominance. An alternative is strictly dominated if there is another alternative that is both more effective and less costly. An alternative is extendedly dominated if it has an ICER greater than that of a more effective alternative.\n\nLet's compare the costs and effects of the alternatives in their effectiveness order.\n- Compare Alternative $A$ and Alternative $C$: Alternative $C$ is more effective ($E_C  E_A$) and more costly ($C_C  C_A$). Neither dominates the other.\n- Compare Alternative $C$ and Alternative $B$: Alternative $B$ is more effective than Alternative $C$ ($E_B = 0.80  E_C = 0.79$). At the same time, Alternative $B$ is less costly than Alternative $C$ ($C_B = \\$12,500  C_C = \\$14,000$).\n\nSince Alternative $B$ provides a greater health benefit for a lower cost compared to Alternative $C$, Alternative $B$ strictly dominates Alternative $C$. A rational decision-maker would never choose Alternative $C$ when Alternative $B$ is available. Therefore, Alternative $C$ must be eliminated from further consideration.\n\n**3. Calculate the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**\nAfter removing the dominated Alternative $C$, we are left with two non-dominated alternatives: $A$ (Standard care) and $B$ (Add-on therapy).\n- Alternative $A$: $C_A = \\$8,000$, $E_A = 0.75$\n- Alternative $B$: $C_B = \\$12,500$, $E_B = 0.80$\n\nThe ICER is calculated for the more effective option ($B$) relative to the next less effective option ($A$). The formula for the ICER is the change in cost divided by the change in effect:\n$$\n\\text{ICER}_{B \\text{ vs } A} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{C_B - C_A}{E_B - E_A}\n$$\n\nWe compute the incremental cost and incremental effect:\n- Incremental Cost ($\\Delta C$):\n$$\n\\Delta C = C_B - C_A = \\$12,500 - \\$8,000 = \\$4,500\n$$\n- Incremental Effect ($\\Delta E$):\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_B - E_A = 0.80 \\text{ QALYs} - 0.75 \\text{ QALYs} = 0.05 \\text{ QALYs}\n$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the ICER:\n$$\n\\text{ICER}_{B \\text{ vs } A} = \\frac{\\$4,500}{0.05 \\text{ QALYs}} = \\$90,000 \\text{ per QALY}\n$$\n\nThe result is an ICER of $90,000$ USD/QALY.

The problem requires a derivation from first principles, which will be performed as follows.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual has the disease, and $ND$ be the event that the individual does not have the disease. Let $T+$ and $T-$ denote a positive and a negative test result, respectively. The givens from the problem statement are:\n- Disease prevalence: $P(D) = 0.2$. Consequently, the probability of not having the disease is $P(ND) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$.\n- Test sensitivity: $Sens = P(T+|D) = 0.9$. This is the probability of a positive test given the person is diseased.\n- Test specificity: $Spec = P(T-|ND) = 0.95$. This is the probability of a negative test given the person is not diseased.\n- From these, we can deduce:\n  - The false negative rate: $P(T-|D) = 1 - Sens = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1$.\n  - The false positive rate: $P(T+|ND) = 1 - Spec = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n- Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gain for a true positive: $Q_{TP} = 0.3$. For all other outcomes (false positive, true negative, false negative), the QALY gain is $0$.\n- Cost per treated individual: $C_{treat} = \\text{£}6000$.\n- Expected adverse event cost per treated individual: $C_{AE} = \\text{£}1000$. The total cost per treated individual is $C_{total} = C_{treat} + C_{AE} = \\text{£}6000 + \\text{£}1000 = \\text{£}7000$.\n- Willingness-to-pay threshold: $\\lambda = \\text{£}30000$ per QALY.\n\nThe test-and-treat strategy can be structured as a decision tree. The population is first divided by disease status (diseased or not diseased). Each of these branches is then subdivided by the test result (positive or negative). This leads to four possible outcomes for any individual in the population:\n1.  **True Positive (TP)**: Diseased and tests positive. The individual is treated.\n2.  **False Negative (FN)**: Diseased and tests negative. The individual is not treated.\n3.  **False Positive (FP)**: Not diseased and tests positive. The individual is treated.\n4.  **True Negative (TN)**: Not diseased and tests negative. The individual is not treated.\n\nUsing the core definitions and the law of total probability, we derive the probabilities of these four disjoint outcomes for a randomly selected individual from the population:\n-   Probability of a True Positive: $P(TP) = P(D \\cap T+) = P(T+|D)P(D) = Sens \\times P(D) = 0.9 \\times 0.2 = 0.18$.\n-   Probability of a False Negative: $P(FN) = P(D \\cap T-) = P(T-|D)P(D) = (1 - Sens) \\times P(D) = 0.1 \\times 0.2 = 0.02$.\n-   Probability of a False Positive: $P(FP) = P(ND \\cap T+) = P(T+|ND)P(ND) = (1 - Spec) \\times P(ND) = 0.05 \\times 0.8 = 0.04$.\n-   Probability of a True Negative: $P(TN) = P(ND \\cap T-) = P(T-|ND)P(ND) = Spec \\times P(ND) = 0.95 \\times 0.8 = 0.76$.\nThe sum of these probabilities is $0.18 + 0.02 + 0.04 + 0.76 = 1.00$, as expected.\n\nNext, we derive the expected QALYs per individual, denoted $E[Q]$, using the law of total expectation. The expected value is the sum of the QALY gains for each outcome weighted by their respective probabilities.\n$E[Q] = P(TP) \\times Q_{TP} + P(FP) \\times 0 + P(FN) \\times 0 + P(TN) \\times 0$\n$E[Q] = P(TP) \\times Q_{TP} = (Sens \\times P(D)) \\times Q_{TP}$\nSubstituting the values:\n$E[Q] = 0.18 \\times 0.3 = 0.054$ QALYs.\n\nThen, we derive the expected cost per individual, $E[C]$. Costs are incurred only for individuals who are treated, which are those who test positive (TPs and FPs). The probability of testing positive, $P(T+)$, is the sum of the probabilities of a true positive and a false positive:\n$P(T+) = P(TP) + P(FP) = 0.18 + 0.04 = 0.22$.\nThe total cost per treatment is $C_{total} = \\text{£}7000$. The expected cost per individual is the total cost per treatment multiplied by the probability of being treated:\n$E[C] = C_{total} \\times P(T+) = (C_{treat} + C_{AE}) \\times (P(TP) + P(FP))$\nSubstituting the values:\n$E[C] = 7000 \\times 0.22 = \\text{£}1540$.\n\nFinally, we compute the expected net monetary benefit (NMB) per individual. The NMB is defined as the monetized value of the expected QALY gain minus the expected cost.\n$NMB = \\lambda \\times E[Q] - E[C]$\nSubstituting the calculated expected values and the given willingness-to-pay threshold:\n$NMB = 30000 \\times 0.054 - 1540$\n$NMB = 1620 - 1540 = 80$.\nThe expected net monetary benefit is £$80$.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact value is $80$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $80.00$ or in scientific notation.

The model comprises three mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive health states: Healthy ($S_1$), Sick ($S_2$), and Dead ($S_3$). The evolution of a cohort of individuals through these states over time is governed by a finite-state Markov chain.\n\nThe state of the cohort at the beginning of any discrete time cycle $t$ is described by a row vector $p_t = [p_{t,1}, p_{t,2}, p_{t,3}]$, where $p_{t,j}$ is the proportion of the cohort in state $S_j$. By definition, the components of $p_t$ must sum to $1$, i.e., $\\sum_{j=1}^{3} p_{t,j} = 1$. The initial distribution of the cohort is given by the vector $p_1$.\n\nThe dynamics of the system are defined by a $3 \\times 3$ transition probability matrix $T$. The element $T_{ij}$ represents the probability of an individual transitioning from state $S_i$ to state $S_j$ in a single time cycle. For $T$ to be a valid transition matrix, it must be row-stochastic, meaning that the sum of probabilities in each row is $1$: $\\sum_{j=1}^{3} T_{ij} = 1$ for each $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The Dead state ($S_3$) is specified as absorbing, which implies that once an individual enters this state, they cannot leave. This is correctly represented in the given test cases by the third row of the transition matrix being $[0, 0, 1]$.\n\nThe core principle of the Markov model is that the state of the system at the next time step, $t+1$, depends only on the current state at time $t$. The cohort distribution evolves according to the matrix equation:\n$$p_{t+1} = p_t \\, T$$\nThis equation is a direct consequence of the law of total probability, where the proportion of the cohort in state $S_j$ at time $t+1$ is the sum of proportions transitioning from all possible states $S_i$ at time $t$: $p_{t+1,j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} p_{t,i} T_{ij}$.\n\nThe problem objective is to compute the vector of expected total time spent in each state, denoted by $\\tau$, over a time horizon of $N$ cycles. With a normalized cycle length of $1$, the proportion of the cohort in a state $p_{t,j}$ during cycle $t$ corresponds to the total time spent (in person-cycles) in that state during that cycle. Therefore, the total expected time in each state over $N$ cycles is the sum of the pre-transition occupancy vectors for each cycle:\n$$\\tau = \\sum_{t=1}^{N} p_t$$\n\nThe problem explicitly forbids the use of closed-form solutions (which would involve matrix inversion and summation of a geometric series of matrices). The algorithm will therefore directly implement the iterative simulation process:\n1. Initialize a total time vector $\\tau = [0, 0, 0]$.\n2. Initialize the current state vector $p_{current} = p_1$.\n3. Loop for $t$ from $1$ to $N$:\n    a.
