We will begin from first principles, namely the statistical framework of the two-sample $z$-test for means.\n\nLet $X_{1j}$ and $X_{2j}$ be the continuous outcomes for the $j$-th subject in the treatment arm (arm $1$) and control arm (arm $2$), respectively. The outcomes are assumed to be independent and (approximately) normally distributed, $X_{ij} \\sim N(\\mu_i, \\sigma^2)$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, with a common variance $\\sigma^2$. This is justified by the Central Limit Theorem. The treatment effect is the difference in means, $\\delta = \\mu_1 - \\mu_2$.\n\nThe trial uses equal allocation, so the sample sizes in each arm are $n_1 = n_2 = N/2$, where $N$ is the total sample size. The estimator for the treatment effect is the difference in sample means, $\\hat{\\delta} = \\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2$.\n\nThe sampling distribution of $\\hat{\\delta}$ is normal with mean $E[\\hat{\\delta}] = \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = \\delta$ and variance $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\delta}) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_1) + \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_2) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_2} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{N/2} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{N/2} = \\frac{4\\sigma^2}{N}$. Thus, $\\hat{\\delta} \\sim N(\\delta, \\frac{4\\sigma^2}{N})$.\n\nThe trial is designed to test the one-sided null hypothesis $H_0: \\delta \\le 0$ against the alternative $H_1: \\delta > 0$. For constructing the test, we consider the boundary case $H_0: \\delta = 0$. The standardized test statistic is:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\hat{\\delta} - 0}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\delta})}} = \\frac{\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{\\sqrt{4\\sigma^2/N}} $$\nUnder $H_0$, $Z$ follows a standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$.\n\nThe one-sided type I error rate is specified as $\\alpha = 0.025$. The null hypothesis is rejected if the test statistic $Z$ exceeds a critical value, $c$. This critical value is determined by $P(Z > c | H_0) = \\alpha$. For a standard normal variable, this implies $c = z_{1-\\alpha}$, the $(1-\\alpha)$-quantile of the standard normal distribution. Given $\\alpha = 0.025$, the critical value is $c = z_{1-0.025} = z_{0.975}$.\n\nPower is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when a specific alternative hypothesis is true.

This involves using an interim estimate of the variance, $\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = 1.44$, to recalculate the required sample size to achieve the target power. The re-estimation preserves the originally planned critical value ($z_{1-\\alpha}$), the target power ($1-\\beta$), and the effect size of interest ($\\delta_A$).
