It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution.\n\nLet the event of a patient being a true responder be denoted by $R$, and a true non-responder by $NR$. Let the event of a biomarker test result being positive be $B+$, and negative be $B-$. The problem provides the following data from a sample of $N=1000$ patients:\n- Number of true responders, $N_R = 280$.\n- Number of true non-responders, $N_{NR} = 720$.\n- Number of true positives (biomarker-positive among true responders), $N_{TP} = 252$.\n- Number of false negatives (biomarker-negative among true responders), $N_{FN} = 28$.\n- Number of false positives (biomarker-positive among true non-responders), $N_{FP} = 144$.\n- Number of true negatives (biomarker-negative among true non-responders), $N_{TN} = 576$.\n\nWe can verify the consistency of the data:\n$N_{TP} + N_{FN} = 252 + 28 = 280 = N_R$.\n$N_{FP} + N_{TN} = 144 + 576 = 720 = N_{NR}$.\n$N_R + N_{NR} = 280 + 720 = 1000 = N$.\nThe data are internally consistent.\n\n**1) Computation of Sensitivity and Specificity**\n\nSensitivity ($Se$) is defined as the conditional probability of a positive test result given that the patient is a true responder, $P(B+|R)$. Using the provided trial data, we estimate this probability as the ratio of true positives to the total number of true responders.\n$$\nSe = P(B+|R) = \\frac{N_{TP}}{N_{TP} + N_{FN}} = \\frac{252}{280} = \\frac{9 \\times 28}{10 \\times 28} = \\frac{9}{10} = 0.9\n$$\nSpecificity ($Sp$) is defined as the conditional probability of a negative test result given that the patient is a true non-responder, $P(B-|NR)$. We estimate this probability as the ratio of true negatives to the total number of true non-responders.\n$$\nSp = P(B-|NR) = \\frac{N_{TN}}{N_{TN} + N_{FP}} = \\frac{576}{720} = \\frac{4 \\times 144}{5 \\times 144} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8\n$$\nThus, the sensitivity of the biomarker is $0.9$ and the specificity is $0.8$.\n\n**2) Derivation and Evaluation of PPV and NPV**\n\nLet $p$ be the prevalence of true responders in a target population, so $P(R) = p$. Consequently, the prevalence of non-responders is $P(NR) = 1-p$. The sensitivity and specificity are properties of the test and are assumed to be constant, with $Se = P(B+|R) = 0.9$ and $Sp = P(B-|NR) = 0.8$.\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value, $\\mathrm{PPV}(p)$, is the conditional probability of a patient being a true responder given a positive test result, $P(R|B+)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV}(p) = P(R|B+) = \\frac{P(B+|R)P(R)}{P(B+)}\n$$\nThe numerator is $P(B+|R)P(R) = Se \\cdot p$.\nThe denominator, $P(B+)$, is found using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(B+) = P(B+|R)P(R) + P(B+|NR)P(NR)\n$$\nWe know $P(B+|NR) = 1 - P(B-|NR) = 1 - Sp$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(B+)$:\n$$\nP(B+) = Se \\cdot p + (1-Sp) \\cdot (1-p)\n$$\nTherefore, the analytic expression for $\\mathrm{PPV}(p)$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV}(p) = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1-Sp)(1-p)}\n$$\nThe Negative Predictive Value, $\\mathrm{NPV}(p)$, is the conditional probability of a patient being a true non-responder given a negative test result, $P(NR|B-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NPV}(p) = P(NR|B-) = \\frac{P(B-|NR)P(NR)}{P(B-)}\n$$\nThe numerator is $P(B-|NR)P(NR) = Sp \\cdot (1-p)$.\nThe denominator, $P(B-)$, is found using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(B-) = P(B-|R)P(R) + P(B-|NR)P(NR)\n$$\nWe know $P(B-|R) = 1 - P(B+|R) = 1 - Se$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(B-)$:\n$$\nP(B-) = (1-Se) \\cdot p + Sp \\cdot (1-p)\n$$\nTherefore, the analytic expression for $\\mathrm{NPV}(p)$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NPV}(p) = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1-p)}{(1-Se)p + Sp(1-p)}\n$$\nNow we evaluate these for $p = 0.10$, using $Se=0.9$ and $Sp=0.8$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV}(0.10) = \\frac{0.9 \\cdot 0.10}{0.9 \\cdot 0.10 + (1-0.8)(1-0.10)} = \\frac{0.09}{0.09 + (0.2)(0.9)} = \\frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.18} = \\frac{0.09}{0.27} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{NPV}(0.10) = \\frac{0.8 \\cdot (1-0.10)}{(1-0.9)(0.10) + 0.8(1-0.10)} = \\frac{0.8 \\cdot 0.9}{0.1 \\cdot 0.10 + 0.8 \\cdot 0.9} = \\frac{0.72}{0.01 + 0.72} = \\frac{0.72}{0.73}\n$$\n\n**3) Solving for the Prevalence $p^{\\ast}$ where $\\mathrm{PPV}(p^{\\ast}) = \\mathrm{NPV}(p^{\\ast})$**\n\nWe set the analytic expressions for PPV and NPV equal to each other to solve for $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\frac{Se \\cdot p^{\\ast}}{Se \\cdot p^{\\ast} + (1-Sp)(1-p^{\\ast})} = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1-p^{\\ast})}{(1-Se)p^{\\ast} + Sp(1-p^{\\ast})}\n$$\nCross-multiplying yields:\n$$\nSe \\cdot p^{\\ast} \\left[ (1-Se)p^{\\ast} + Sp(1-p^{\\ast}) \\right] = Sp \\cdot (1-p^{\\ast}) \\left[ Se \\cdot p^{\\ast} + (1-Sp)(1-p^{\\ast}) \\right]\n$$\nExpanding both sides:\n$$\nSe(1-Se)(p^{\\ast})^2 + Se \\cdot Sp \\cdot p^{\\ast}(1-p^{\\ast}) = Sp \\cdot Se \\cdot p^{\\ast}(1-p^{\\ast}) + Sp(1-Sp)(1-p^{\\ast})^2\n$$\nThe term $Se \\cdot Sp \\cdot p^{\\ast}(1-p^{\\ast})$ is common to both sides and cancels out, leaving:\n$$\nSe(1-Se)(p^{\\ast})^2 = Sp(1-Sp)(1-p^{\\ast})^2\n$$\nAssuming $p^{\\ast} \\in (0,1)$, $Se \\in (0,1)$, and $Sp \\in (0,1)$, all terms are positive, so we can take the square root of both sides:\n$$\n\\sqrt{Se(1-Se)} \\cdot p^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{Sp(1-Sp)} \\cdot (1-p^{\\ast})\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{Se(1-Se)} \\cdot p^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{Sp(1-Sp)} - \\sqrt{Sp(1-Sp)} \\cdot p^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\np^{\\ast} \\left( \\sqrt{Se(1-Se)} + \\sqrt{Sp(1-Sp)} \\right) = \\sqrt{Sp(1-Sp)}\n$$\nThis gives the closed-form solution for $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$\np^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\sqrt{Sp(1-Sp)}}{\\sqrt{Se(1-Se)} + \\sqrt{Sp(1-Sp)}}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values $Se=0.9$ and $Sp=0.8$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{Se(1-Se)} = \\sqrt{0.9(1-0.9)} = \\sqrt{0.9(0.1)} = \\sqrt{0.09} = 0.3\n$$\n$$\n\\sqrt{Sp(1-Sp)} = \\sqrt{0.8(1-0.8)} = \\sqrt{0.8(0.2)} = \\sqrt{0.16} = 0.4\n$$\n$$\np^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.4}{0.3 + 0.4} = \\frac{0.4}{0.7} = \\frac{4}{7}\n$$\nAs a decimal rounded to four significant figures, this is $p^{\\ast} \\approx 0.5714$.\n\n**4) Interpretation of the Effect of Prevalence $p$**\n\nThe derived formulas for $\\mathrm{PPV}(p)$ and $\\mathrm{NPV}(p)$ show how these metrics depend on the prevalence $p$.\nThe derivative of $\\mathrm{PPV}(p)$ with respect to $p$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dp}\\mathrm{PPV}(p) = \\frac{Se(1-Sp)}{[Se \\cdot p + (1-Sp)(1-p)]^2}\n$$\nSince $Se \\in (0,1)$ and $Sp \\in (0,1)$, both $Se$ and $(1-Sp)$ are positive. The denominator is a square and is also positive. Thus, $\\frac{d}{dp}\\mathrm{PPV}(p) > 0$, meaning $\\mathrm{PPV}(p)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $p$. As the prevalence of true responders increases, a positive test is more likely to be a true positive, thus increasing the PPV.\n\nThe derivative of $\\mathrm{NPV}(p)$ with respect to $p$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dp}\\mathrm{NPV}(p) = \\frac{Sp(Se-1)}{[(1-Se)p + Sp(1-p)]^2}\n$$\nSince $Sp \\in (0,1)$ and $Se  1$, the numerator term $Sp(Se-1)$ is negative. The denominator is a square and is positive. Thus, $\\frac{d}{dp}\\mathrm{NPV}(p)  0$, meaning $\\mathrm{NPV}(p)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $p$. As the prevalence of true responders increases, there are more responders in the population who could be missed by the test (false negatives), making a negative test less reliable in ruling out the condition, thus decreasing the NPV.\n\nIn summary, $\\mathrm{PPV}(p)$ and $\\mathrm{NPV}(p)$ move in opposite directions as the prevalence $p$ changes. As the condition becomes more common (increasing $p$), the predictive power of a positive test ($\\mathrm{PPV}$) increases, while the predictive power of a negative test ($\\mathrm{NPV}$) decreases. Conversely, for rare conditions (low $p$), a negative test is very reassuring (high $\\mathrm{NPV}$), but a positive test is less conclusive (low $\\mathrm{PPV}$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5714}\n$$", "id": "4585966"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its diagnostic accuracy, a predictive biomarker's value lies in its ability to guide treatment by identifying patients who will benefit most.

The treatment is beneficial for $B=0$ but harmful for $B=1$ (a qualitative interaction).\n\n4.  **Calculate Heterogeneity of Treatment Effect (HTE) on Absolute Risk Scale:**\n    The HTE is the difference in the treatment effect (ARD) between the biomarker strata.\n    $\\Delta_{\\text{ARD}} = \\text{ARD}_{B=1} - \\text{ARD}_{B=0} \\approx 0.00254 - (-0.00091) = 0.00345$.\n\n5.  **Compare with MCID:**\n    The magnitude of the heterogeneity is $|\\Delta_{\\text{ARD}}| = 0.00345$.\n    The prespecified threshold for clinical importance is $\\Delta_{\\text{MCID}}=0.01$.\n    Since $0.00345  0.01$, the statistically significant interaction ($p0.01$ for $\\beta_3$) does not meet the threshold for clinical relevance. The difference in the treatment's effect across biomarker strata is only about $0.35$ percentage points, which is less than the $1$ percentage point required to be considered clinically important.\n\nThis result occurs because the baseline risks are very low ($p_{00}=1\\%$ and $p_{01} \\approx 1.6\\%$). The non-linear logit function is flat for very low (and very high) probabilities, meaning that even a moderate change in the log-odds (the linear predictor) results in a very small change in the absolute probability. The large sample size ($N=10{,}000$) provides high statistical power to detect this small but real interaction effect.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Statistical interaction is a departure from additivity on the model’s link scale quantified by $\\beta_3$, whereas clinical interaction is heterogeneity of treatment effect that is meaningful for decisions on the absolute risk scale relative to a prespecified threshold such as the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID). With low baseline risk, a nonzero, statistically significant $\\beta_3$ can correspond to tiny absolute risk differences across biomarker strata that do not exceed $\\Delta_{\\text{MCID}}$, especially in a large $N$ where small effects achieve $p0.01$.**\nThis statement accurately defines statistical interaction (non-additivity on the log-odds scale, quantified by $\\beta_3$) and clinical interaction (a meaningful difference in treatment effect on a decision-relevant scale, like absolute risk, compared to an MCID). It then correctly explains the mechanism at play: with low baseline risk, the non-linearity of the logit transformation means a model-significant $\\beta_3$ can translate to a clinically non-significant difference in absolute risks. Finally, it correctly notes that large sample sizes make it possible to achieve statistical significance for such small effects. This aligns perfectly with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Statistical interaction means the biomarker predicts outcome irrespective of treatment (prognostic value), while clinical interaction means the biomarker predicts treatment response (predictive value); therefore a significant $\\beta_3$ primarily demonstrates prognostic importance and clinical utility.**\nThis statement confuses fundamental definitions. A biomarker's prognostic value (prediction of outcome irrespective of treatment) is captured by its main effect, $\\beta_2$. A biomarker's predictive value (prediction of treatment response) is captured by the interaction term, $\\beta_3$. Therefore, a significant $\\beta_3$ demonstrates *predictive* (not prognostic) importance. Furthermore, as shown, statistical significance of $\\beta_3$ does not guarantee clinical utility.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Statistical and clinical interaction are the same when the model is correctly specified; a $p$-value below $0.05$ for $\\beta_3$ guarantees that the biomarker meaningfully changes treatment decisions.**\nThis is false. Statistical and clinical interaction are distinct concepts operating on different scales (model link scale vs. absolute risk scale). The entire problem is a counterexample to the claim that a small $p$-value for $\\beta_3$ guarantees clinical meaningfulness. Our calculation showed that despite $p  0.01$, the heterogeneity on the absolute risk scale was less than the $\\Delta_{\\text{MCID}}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Statistical interaction is indicated by different $p$-values for the treatment effect in biomarker-positive and biomarker-negative subgroups, and clinical interaction requires that $\\beta_2$ be statistically significant; thus, a significant $\\beta_3$ implies both statistical and clinical importance.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. Firstly, the formal test for statistical interaction is the test of the interaction coefficient ($\\beta_3$), not a comparison of subgroup $p$-values. Secondly, clinical interaction relates to the size of the treatment effect modification (related to $\\beta_3$), not the prognostic effect of the biomarker (related to $\\beta_2$). A biomarker can be predictive without being prognostic. The conclusion is also false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Because the odds ratio is collapsible, a significant $\\beta_3$ on the logit scale necessarily implies a large difference in absolute risks between biomarker strata when the event is rare, ensuring clinical relevance.**\nThis statement is factually wrong on two counts. First, the odds ratio is famously **non-collapsible**. Second, for rare events, a given odds ratio (or change in log-odds) corresponds to a *smaller*, not larger, absolute risk difference compared to when events are common. The premise is wrong, and the conclusion is the opposite of the truth.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4586009"}]}
