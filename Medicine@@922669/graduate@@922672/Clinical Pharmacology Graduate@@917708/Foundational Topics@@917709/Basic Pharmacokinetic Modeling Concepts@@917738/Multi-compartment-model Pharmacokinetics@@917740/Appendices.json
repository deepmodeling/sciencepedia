The rate of change of the amount of drug in a compartment is the sum of the rates of all inputs minus the sum of the rates of all outputs. The kinetics are first-order, meaning the rate of transfer or elimination from a compartment is proportional to the amount of drug currently in that compartment.\n\n**1. Mass-Balance Equations for Amounts**\n\nFor the central compartment (compartment $1$), the drug amount $A_{1}(t)$ changes due to three processes:\n- Outflow to the peripheral compartment: rate $= k_{12}A_{1}(t)$.\n- Outflow due to elimination from the body: rate $= k_{10}A_{1}(t)$.\n- Inflow from the peripheral compartment: rate $= k_{21}A_{2}(t)$.\n\nThe mass-balance equation for $A_{1}(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dA_{1}}{dt} = \\text{Rate In} - \\text{Rate Out} = k_{21}A_{2}(t) - (k_{12}A_{1}(t) + k_{10}A_{1}(t))\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dA_{1}}{dt} = k_{21}A_{2}(t) - (k_{12} + k_{10})A_{1}(t)\n$$\n\nFor the peripheral compartment (compartment $2$), the drug amount $A_{2}(t)$ changes due to two processes:\n- Inflow from the central compartment: rate $= k_{12}A_{1}(t)$.\n- Outflow to the central compartment: rate $= k_{21}A_{2}(t)$.\n\nThe mass-balance equation for $A_{2}(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dA_{2}}{dt} = \\text{Rate In} - \\text{Rate Out} = k_{12}A_{1}(t) - k_{21}A_{2}(t)\n$$\n\n**2. Conversion to Concentration Equations**\n\nWe use the given relationships $A_{1}(t) = V_{1}C_{1}(t)$ and $A_{2}(t) = V_{2}C_{2}(t)$. Assuming the volumes $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ are constant, we can differentiate these expressions with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA_{1}}{dt} = V_{1}\\frac{dC_{1}}{dt} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dA_{2}}{dt} = V_{2}\\frac{dC_{2}}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the mass-balance equations for amounts:\n\nFor the central compartment:\n$$\nV_{1}\\frac{dC_{1}}{dt} = k_{21}(V_{2}C_{2}(t)) - (k_{12} + k_{10})(V_{1}C_{1}(t))\n$$\nDividing by $V_{1}$ gives the ODE for $C_{1}(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{1}}{dt} = -(k_{12} + k_{10})C_{1}(t) + k_{21}\\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}C_{2}(t)\n$$\n\nFor the peripheral compartment:\n$$\nV_{2}\\frac{dC_{2}}{dt} = k_{12}(V_{1}C_{1}(t)) - k_{21}(V_{2}C_{2}(t))\n$$\nDividing by $V_{2}$ gives the ODE for $C_{2}(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{2}}{dt} = k_{12}\\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}}C_{1}(t) - k_{21}C_{2}(t)\n$$\n\n**3. Initial Conditions**\n\nThe dose $D$ is administered as an instantaneous IV bolus into the central compartment at $t=0$. This means that at the moment of administration, the entire dose resides in the central compartment, and none has yet reached the peripheral compartment.\nTherefore, the initial amounts are:\n$$\nA_{1}(0) = D\n$$\n$$\nA_{2}(0) = 0\n$$\nUsing the relationships $A_{1}(0) = V_{1}C_{1}(0)$ and $A_{2}(0) = V_{2}C_{2}(0)$, we find the initial concentrations:\n$$\nC_{1}(0) = \\frac{A_{1}(0)}{V_{1}} = \\frac{D}{V_{1}}\n$$\n$$\nC_{2}(0) = \\frac{A_{2}(0)}{V_{2}} = \\frac{0}{V_{2}} = 0 \\quad (\\text{assuming } V_{2} > 0)\n$$\n\n**4. Substitution of Numerical Values**\n\nThe problem provides the numerical values for the micro-rate constants: $k_{12}=0.6~\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $k_{21}=0.2~\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, and $k_{10}=0.5~\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. We substitute these into the derived ODEs. For conciseness, we denote $C_{1}(t)$ as $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}(t)$ as $C_{2}$ in the equations.\n\nThe ODE for $C_{1}$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{1}}{dt} = -(0.6 + 0.5)C_{1} + (0.2)\\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}C_{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{1}}{dt} = -1.1 C_{1} + 0.2 \\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}} C_{2}\n$$\n\nThe ODE for $C_{2}$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{2}}{dt} = (0.6)\\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}}C_{1} - (0.2)C_{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC_{2}}{dt} = 0.6 \\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}} C_{1} - 0.2 C_{2}\n$$\n\nThe final system, including initial conditions, is:\n1. Differential equation for $C_{1}$: $\\frac{dC_{1}}{dt} = -1.1 C_{1} + 0.2 \\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}} C_{2}$\n2. Differential equation for $C_{2}$: $\\frac{dC_{2}}{dt} = 0.6 \\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}} C_{1} - 0.2 C_{2}$\n3. Initial condition for $C_{1}$: $C_{1}(0) = \\frac{D}{V_{1}}$\n4.

The biexponential decay function is the correct mathematical description for the concentration in the central compartment following an IV bolus dose in such a model. All concepts are well-established within pharmacology and applied mathematics. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides five empirical parameters ($A, B, \\alpha, \\beta, D$) to determine four model parameters ($V_1, k_{10}, k_{12}, k_{21}$). The system is known to be identifiable, meaning a unique solution for the model parameters exists from the provided data. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, quantitative, and uses standard scientific terminology. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements. The problem is objective.\n- **Other criteria:** The problem is self-contained, consistent, and poses a realistic scenario with plausible numerical values and consistent units.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe system of linear differential equations governing the amount of drug in the central compartment ($X_1$) and peripheral compartment ($X_2$) is:\n$$ \\frac{dX_1}{dt} = -k_{10}X_1 - k_{12}X_1 + k_{21}X_2 = -(k_{10} + k_{12})X_1 + k_{21}X_2 $$\n$$ \\frac{dX_2}{dt} = k_{12}X_1 - k_{21}X_2 $$\nFor a single intravenous bolus dose $D$ administered at $t=0$, the initial conditions are:\n$$ X_1(0) = D $$\n$$ X_2(0) = 0 $$\nThe solution to this system for $X_1(t)$ is a biexponential function. The concentration in the central compartment is given by $C(t) = X_1(t)/V_1$. The problem provides the empirical form of this concentration:\n$$ C(t) = A \\exp(-\\alpha t) + B \\exp(-\\beta t) $$\nFrom this, we can express the amount of drug in the central compartment as:\n$$ X_1(t) = V_1 C(t) = V_1 \\left( A \\exp(-\\alpha t) + B \\exp(-\\beta t) \\right) $$\n\n**1. Derivation of the Volume of the Central Compartment, $V_1$**\nAt time $t=0$, the entire dose $D$ is in the central compartment, so $X_1(0) = D$.\nFrom the empirical equation for concentration, the concentration at $t=0$ is:\n$$ C(0) = A \\exp(0) + B \\exp(0) = A+B $$\nUsing the relationship $X_1(t) = V_1 C(t)$ at $t=0$:\n$$ X_1(0) = V_1 C(0) \\implies D = V_1 (A+B) $$\nSolving for $V_1$, we obtain the first relationship:\n$$ V_1 = \\frac{D}{A+B} $$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Micro-rate Constants ($k_{10}, k_{12}, k_{21}$)**\nThe constants $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are hybrid rate constants derived from the micro-rate constants. Specifically, $-\\alpha$ and $-\\beta$ are the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix of the system of ODEs:\n$$ \\mathbf{K} = \\begin{pmatrix} -(k_{10}+k_{12}) & k_{21} \\\\ k_{12} & -k_{21} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe characteristic equation is $\\det(\\mathbf{K} - \\lambda\\mathbf{I}) = 0$:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -(k_{10}+k_{12}) - \\lambda & k_{21} \\\\ k_{12} & -k_{21} - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ (-(k_{10}+k_{12}) - \\lambda)(-k_{21} - \\lambda) - k_{12}k_{21} = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 + (k_{10}+k_{12}+k_{21})\\lambda + (k_{10}+k_{12})k_{21} - k_{12}k_{21} = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 + (k_{10}+k_{12}+k_{21})\\lambda + k_{10}k_{21} = 0 $$\nThe roots of this equation are the eigenvalues, $\\lambda_1 = -\\alpha$ and $\\lambda_2 = -\\beta$. By Vieta's formulas relating the roots of a polynomial to its coefficients:\nSum of roots: $(-\\alpha) + (-\\beta) = -(k_{10} + k_{12} + k_{21}) \\implies \\alpha + \\beta = k_{10} + k_{12} + k_{21}$\nProduct of roots: $(-\\alpha)(-\\beta) = \\alpha\\beta = k_{10}k_{21}$\n\nWe have two equations but three unknown rate constants. A third equation is obtained by relating the coefficients $A$ and $B$ to the micro-constants. The formal solution for $X_1(t)$ derived from the system of ODEs with the given initial conditions is:\n$$ X_1(t) = \\frac{D}{\\alpha-\\beta} \\left[ (\\alpha - k_{21}) \\exp(-\\alpha t) + (k_{21} - \\beta) \\exp(-\\beta t) \\right] $$\nBy comparing this with the empirical form $X_1(t) = V_1 A \\exp(-\\alpha t) + V_1 B \\exp(-\\beta t)$ and substituting $V_1=D/(A+B)$:\n$$ \\frac{D}{A+B} A = \\frac{D(\\alpha - k_{21})}{\\alpha-\\beta} \\implies \\frac{A}{A+B} = \\frac{\\alpha - k_{21}}{\\alpha-\\beta} $$\n$$ \\frac{D}{A+B} B = \\frac{D(k_{21} - \\beta)}{\\alpha-\\beta} \\implies \\frac{B}{A+B} = \\frac{k_{21} - \\beta}{\\alpha-\\beta} $$\nWe can solve for $k_{21}$ using either equation. From the second one:\n$$ B(\\alpha-\\beta) = (A+B)(k_{21}-\\beta) = (A+B)k_{21} - (A+B)\\beta $$\n$$ (A+B)k_{21} = B\\alpha - B\\beta + A\\beta + B\\beta = A\\beta + B\\alpha $$\nThis gives the expression for $k_{21}$:\n$$ k_{21} = \\frac{A\\beta + B\\alpha}{A+B} $$\nNow we have a system of three equations to solve for the three micro-rate constants:\n(i) $k_{21} = \\frac{A\\beta + B\\alpha}{A+B}$\n(ii) $k_{10} = \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{k_{21}}$\n(iii) $k_{12} = (\\alpha + \\beta) - k_{10} - k_{21}$\n\n**3.
