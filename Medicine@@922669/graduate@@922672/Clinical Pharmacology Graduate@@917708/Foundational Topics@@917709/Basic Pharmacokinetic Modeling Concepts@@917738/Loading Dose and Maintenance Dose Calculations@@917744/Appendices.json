The provided pharmacokinetic parameters are within a realistic range for a therapeutic drug. The problem will be solved by applying first principles of mass balance and core pharmacokinetic definitions.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Oral Loading Dose ($LD$)**\n\nThe loading dose ($LD$) is intended to rapidly achieve a target amount of drug in the body, which corresponds to the target plasma concentration ($C_{\\text{target}}$). The fundamental relationship between the amount of drug in the body ($A$) and the plasma concentration ($C$) is given by the definition of the volume of distribution ($V_{d}$):\n$$C = \\frac{A}{V_d}$$\nTherefore, to achieve a target concentration of $C_{\\text{target}}$, the required amount of drug in the body ($A_{\\text{target}}$) is:\n$$A_{\\text{target}} = C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot V_{d}$$\nThe problem specifies oral administration. The bioavailability, $F$, is the fraction of the administered oral dose that reaches the systemic circulation. Thus, the amount of drug that actually enters the body from an oral loading dose ($LD$) is $F \\cdot LD$.\nFor the amount of drug in the body to instantaneously reach $A_{\\text{target}}$ upon absorption, we must have:\n$$F \\cdot LD = A_{\\text{target}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $A_{\\text{target}}$, we get the mass-balance equation for the loading dose:\n$$F \\cdot LD = C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot V_{d}$$\nSolving for $LD$:\n$$LD = \\frac{C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot V_{d}}{F}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n-   $C_{\\text{target}} = 7.5 \\text{ mg/L}$\n-   $V_{d} = 35 \\text{ L}$\n-   $F = 0.85$\n$$LD = \\frac{(7.5 \\text{ mg/L}) \\cdot (35 \\text{ L})}{0.85} = \\frac{262.5 \\text{ mg}}{0.85} \\approx 308.8235 \\text{ mg}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the loading dose is $308.8$ mg.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Oral Maintenance Dose ($MD$)**\n\nThe maintenance dose ($MD$) is designed to replace the amount of drug eliminated by the body over one dosing interval ($\\tau$), thereby maintaining the average concentration at a steady state. At steady state, the average rate of drug administration must equal the average rate of drug elimination.\n\nThe rate of drug elimination is governed by clearance ($CL$). Clearance is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of the drug per unit time. The rate of elimination (mass per time) is the product of clearance and plasma concentration ($C$):\n$$\\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL \\cdot C$$\nAt steady state, the concentration fluctuates, but the average rate of elimination over a dosing interval can be calculated using the average steady-state concentration, $C_{ss,avg}$. The problem requires this average to be the target concentration, $C_{\\text{target}}$.\n$$\\text{Average Rate of Elimination} = CL \\cdot C_{ss,avg} = CL \\cdot C_{\\text{target}}$$\nThe rate of drug administration is the amount of drug entering the systemic circulation per dosing interval, averaged over that interval. For an oral maintenance dose $MD$ with bioavailability $F$ given every $\\tau$ hours, the amount entering the circulation per dose is $F \\cdot MD$. The average rate of administration is:\n$$\\text{Average Rate of Administration} = \\frac{F \\cdot MD}{\\tau}$$\nEquating the average rates at steady state:\n$$\\frac{F \\cdot MD}{\\tau} = CL \\cdot C_{\\text{target}}$$\nSolving for $MD$:\n$$MD = \\frac{CL \\cdot C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot \\tau}{F}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n-   $CL = 2.8 \\text{ L/h}$\n-   $C_{\\text{target}} = 7.5 \\text{ mg/L}$\n-   $\\tau = 12 \\text{ h}$\n-   $F = 0.85$\n$$MD = \\frac{(2.8 \\text{ L/h}) \\cdot (7.5 \\text{ mg/L}) \\cdot (12 \\text{ h})}{0.85} = \\frac{252 \\text{ mg}}{0.85} \\approx 296.4705 \\text{ mg}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the maintenance dose is $296.5$ mg.\n\n**3. Impact of Errors in $V_{d}$ and $CL$**\n\nThe roles of volume of distribution ($V_{d}$) and clearance ($CL$) are distinct, and errors in their estimation have different consequences for the loading dose and maintenance dosing outcomes.\n\n**Effect on Initial Concentration after Loading Dose:**\nThe initial concentration achieved immediately after the absorption of the loading dose, $C_{0}$, is determined by the principle that the bioavailable dose ($F \\cdot LD$) fills the volume of distribution ($V_d$).\n$$C_{0} = \\frac{F \\cdot LD}{V_d}$$\nThe loading dose ($LD$) is calculated using an *estimated* $V_{d,est}$: $LD = (C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot V_{d,est}) / F$. Substituting this into the equation for the *actual* achieved concentration $C_0$ which depends on the *true* $V_d$:\n$$C_0 = \\frac{F}{V_d} \\left( \\frac{C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot V_{d,est}}{F} \\right) = C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot \\frac{V_{d,est}}{V_d}$$\nThis relationship shows that the achieved initial concentration $C_0$ is directly proportional to the estimated $V_{d,est}$ and inversely proportional to the true $V_d$.\n-   If $V_d$ is **overestimated** ($V_{d,est} > V_d$), the calculated $LD$ will be too large. This results in an achieved initial concentration $C_0$ that is **higher** than the target $C_{\\text{target}}$.\n-   If $V_d$ is **underestimated** ($V_{d,est} < V_d$), the calculated $LD$ will be too small, resulting in an achieved $C_0$ that is **lower** than $C_{\\text{target}}$.\nCritically, the parameter $CL$ does not appear in the equation for $C_0$. Therefore, an error in the estimation of $CL$ has **no effect** on the initial concentration achieved by the loading dose. $CL$ only governs how quickly the concentration declines *after* this initial level is achieved.\n\n**Effect on Average Steady-State Concentration:**\nThe average steady-state concentration ($C_{ss,avg}$) is determined by the balance between the rate of drug administration and the rate of drug elimination. As derived previously:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\cdot MD}{CL \\cdot \\tau}$$\nThe maintenance dose ($MD$) is calculated using an *estimated* $CL_{est}$: $MD = (CL_{est} \\cdot C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot \\tau) / F$. Substituting this into the equation for the *actual* achieved $C_{ss,avg}$ which depends on the *true* $CL$:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F}{CL \\cdot \\tau} \\left( \\frac{CL_{est} \\cdot C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot \\tau}{F} \\right) = C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot \\frac{CL_{est}}{CL}$$\nThis relationship shows that the achieved $C_{ss,avg}$ is directly proportional to the estimated $CL_{est}$ and inversely proportional to the true $CL$.\n-   If $CL$ is **overestimated** ($CL_{est} > CL$), the calculated $MD$ will be too large to compensate for a faster-than-actual perceived elimination. This results in an achieved $C_{ss,avg}$ that is **higher** than the target $C_{\\text{target}}$.\n-   If $CL$ is **underestimated** ($CL_{est} < CL$), the calculated $MD$ will be too small, resulting in an achieved $C_{ss,avg}$ that is **lower** than $C_{\\text{target}}$.\nCritically, the parameter $V_d$ does not appear in the equation for $C_{ss,avg}$. Therefore, an error in the estimation of $V_d$ has **no effect** on the average concentration achieved at steady state. An incorrect $V_d$ would alter the time to reach steady state and the magnitude of the fluctuations (peak and trough concentrations) around the average, but not the average value itself.\n\nIn summary, the loading dose and the initial concentration are governed by $V_d$, while the maintenance dose and the average steady-state concentration are governed by $CL$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 308.8 & 296.5 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4961351"}, {"introduction": "Beyond calculating individual doses, a clinician must understand the long-term dynamics of a drug regimen.

The model assumes instantaneous absorption and distribution, with first-order elimination.\n\nFirst, we determine the first-order elimination rate constant, $k_e$. This parameter is fundamentally related to clearance ($CL$) and the apparent volume of distribution ($V_d$) by the definition of clearance:\n$$\nCL = k_e \\cdot V_d\n$$\nSolving for $k_e$:\n$$\nk_e = \\frac{CL}{V_d} = \\frac{6.0\\ \\text{L/h}}{140\\ \\text{L}} = \\frac{3}{70}\\ \\text{h}^{-1} \\approx 0.042857\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe primary objective is to minimize the steady-state peak–trough fluctuation.
