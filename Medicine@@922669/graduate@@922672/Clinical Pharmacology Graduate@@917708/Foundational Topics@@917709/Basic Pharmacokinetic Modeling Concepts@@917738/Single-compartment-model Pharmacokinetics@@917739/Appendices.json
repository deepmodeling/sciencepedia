We begin with the mass balance equation, which is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation.\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt}=-k\\,A(t)\n$$\nThis equation is separable. We can rearrange it to separate the variables $A$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{A(t)} dA(t) = -k\\,dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to a generic time $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{A(0)}^{A(t)} \\frac{1}{A'} dA' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k\\,dt'\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln|A'|]_{A(0)}^{A(t)} = [-kt']_{0}^{t}\n$$\nSince the amount of drug $A(t)$ is a non-negative quantity, we can drop the absolute value.\n$$\n\\ln(A(t)) - \\ln(A(0)) = -k(t - 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{A(t)}{A(0)}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the solution for the amount of drug $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{A(t)}{A(0)} = \\exp(-kt) \\implies A(t) = A(0)\\exp(-kt)\n$$\nUsing the initial condition $A(0)=D$, the expression becomes:\n$$\nA(t) = D\\exp(-kt)\n$$\nNext, we use the definition of concentration, $C(t)=\\frac{A(t)}{V}$, to find the concentration profile:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{D\\exp(-kt)}{V}\n$$\nThis can also be written in terms of the initial concentration $C(0)$. At $t=0$, $C(0) = \\frac{A(0)}{V} = \\frac{D}{V}$. Therefore:\n$$\nC(t) = C(0)\\exp(-kt)\n$$\nNow, we compute the value of $C(3\\,\\mathrm{h})$ using the given parameters: $D=100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, $V=20\\,\\mathrm{L}$, and $k=0.2\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\nFirst, calculate the initial concentration $C(0)$:\n$$\nC(0) = \\frac{D}{V} = \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{20\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate $C(t)$ at $t=3\\,\\mathrm{h}$:\n$$\nC(3\\,\\mathrm{h}) = (5\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\times \\exp(-0.2\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\times 3\\,\\mathrm{h})\n$$\n$$\nC(3\\,\\mathrm{h}) = 5 \\times \\exp(-0.6)\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\nC(3\\,\\mathrm{h}) \\approx 5 \\times 0.548811636 \\dots \\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} \\approx 2.744058 \\dots \\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, as requested, we get $C(3\\,\\mathrm{h}) = 2.744\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n\nThe second part of the problem concerns the half-life, $t_{1/2}$.

At $t=3\\,\\mathrm{h}$, the fraction remaining is:\n$$\n\\frac{C(3\\,\\mathrm{h})}{C(0)} = \\exp(-k \\times 3\\,\\mathrm{h}) = \\exp(-0.2 \\times 3) = \\exp(-0.6) \\approx 0.5488\n$$\nSince $t=3\\,\\mathrm{h}$ is less than one half-life ($t_{1/2}$), it is expected that more than half of the initial concentration remains. The calculation confirms this, as the fraction remaining at $3\\,\\mathrm{h}$ ($0.5488$) is greater than the fraction remaining at one half-life ($0.5$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.744}$$", "id": "4591301"}, {"introduction": "Beyond understanding the concentration at a single point in time, a key task in pharmacology is to quantify the total drug exposure a patient receives.

This can be written in a bi-exponential form:\n$$ C(t) = A e^{-kt} - A e^{-k_a t} $$\nwhere the intercept coefficient $A$ is given by $A = \\frac{F \\cdot D \\cdot k_a}{V \\cdot (k_a - k)}$.\n\nThe method of residuals is predicated on the condition $k_a  k$, which implies that the term $A e^{-k_a t}$ decays to zero much faster than the term $A e^{-kt}$. At late time points, the concentration is therefore dominated by the elimination process:\n$$ C_{term}(t) \\approx A e^{-kt} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of this expression gives a linear relationship:\n$$ \\ln(C_{term}(t)) \\approx \\ln(A) - kt $$\nThis equation has the form of a straight line, $y = b + mx$, where $y = \\ln(C)$, $x = t$, the slope is $m = -k$, and the y-intercept is $b = \\ln(A)$.\n\n**Part 1: Estimation of the Elimination Rate Constant, $k$**\n\nWe will fit the terminal data points to a straight line on a semilogarithmic plot (i.e., fit $\\ln(C)$ vs. $t$). By inspection of the data, the concentration peaks around $t=2.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$ and then declines. The terminal linear phase can be assumed to begin at or after $t=5.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$. We will use the last four data points for this fit:\n- $t_1 = 5.0\\ \\mathrm{h}, C_1 = 3.61\\ \\mathrm{mg/L} \\implies \\ln(C_1) = 1.2837$\n- $t_2 = 8.0\\ \\mathrm{h}, C_2 = 2.02\\ \\mathrm{mg/L} \\implies \\ln(C_2) = 0.7031$\n- $t_3 = 12.0\\ \\mathrm{h}, C_3 = 0.91\\ \\mathrm{mg/L} \\implies \\ln(C_3) = -0.0943$\n- $t_4 = 16.0\\ \\mathrm{h}, C_4 = 0.41\\ \\mathrm{mg/L} \\implies \\ln(C_4) = -0.8916$\n\nUsing linear regression for $y_i = \\ln(C_i)$ versus $x_i = t_i$:\n- $n = 4$\n- $\\sum t_i = 5.0 + 8.0 + 12.0 + 16.0 = 41.0$\n- $\\sum \\ln(C_i) = 1.2837 + 0.7031 - 0.0943 - 0.8916 = 1.0009$\n- $\\sum t_i^2 = 5^2 + 8^2 + 12^2 + 16^2 = 25 + 64 + 144 + 256 = 489$\n- $\\sum t_i \\ln(C_i) = (5.0)(1.2837) + (8.0)(0.7031) + (12.0)(-0.0943) + (16.0)(-0.8916) = 6.4185 + 5.6248 - 1.1316 - 14.2656 = -3.3539$\n\nThe slope, $m = -k$, is calculated as:\n$$ m = \\frac{n \\sum(t_i \\ln(C_i)) - (\\sum t_i)(\\sum \\ln(C_i))}{n \\sum t_i^2 - (\\sum t_i)^2} = \\frac{4(-3.3539) - (41.0)(1.0009)}{4(489) - (41.0)^2} = \\frac{-13.4156 - 41.0369}{1956 - 1681} = \\frac{-54.4525}{275} \\approx -0.1980 $$\nThus, $k = -m \\approx 0.198\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. This value is very close to $0.20\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n\nThe intercept, $b = \\ln(A)$, is:\n$$ b = \\frac{\\sum \\ln(C_i)}{n} - m \\frac{\\sum t_i}{n} = \\frac{1.0009}{4} - (-0.1980) \\frac{41.0}{4} = 0.2502 + 2.0295 = 2.2797 $$\nSo, $\\ln(A) \\approx 2.28$ and $A = e^{2.28} \\approx 9.78$. The equation for the extrapolated terminal line is $C_{extrap}(t) \\approx 9.78 e^{-0.198 t}$. For subsequent calculations, we will use the approximate values $k = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ and $A=9.78$.\n\n**Part 2: Estimation of the Absorption Rate Constant, $k_a$**\n\nThe residual concentration, $C_{res}(t)$, is the difference between the extrapolated concentration from the elimination phase and the measured concentration at early times.\n$$ C_{res}(t) = C_{extrap}(t) - C(t) = (A e^{-kt}) - (A e^{-kt} - A e^{-k_a t}) = A e^{-k_a t} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm gives another linear relationship:\n$$ \\ln(C_{res}(t)) = \\ln(A) - k_a t $$\nThe slope of this line is $-k_a$, and the intercept is $\\ln(A)$, which should be the same as the intercept from the terminal phase line. We calculate the residuals for the early time points not used in the first fit.\nThe extrapolated line is $C_{extrap}(t) = 9.78 e^{-0.20 t}$.\n- At $t = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{h}$: $C_{extrap}(0.5) = 9.78 e^{-0.1} \\approx 8.85\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. $C_{res}(0.5) = 8.85 - 2.98 = 5.87\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. $\\ln(C_{res}) = 1.7699$.\n- At $t = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$: $C_{extrap}(1.0) = 9.78 e^{-0.2} \\approx 8.01\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. $C_{res}(1.0) = 8.01 - 4.51 = 3.50\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. $\\ln(C_{res}) = 1.2528$.\n- At $t = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$: $C_{extrap}(2.0) = 9.78 e^{-0.4} \\approx 6.56\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. $C_{res}(2.0) = 6.56 - 5.35 = 1.21\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. $\\ln(C_{res}) = 0.1906$.\n- At $t = 3.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$: $C_{extrap(3.0) = 9.78 e^{-0.6} \\approx 5.37\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}}$. $C_{res}(3.0) = 5.37 - 4.99 = 0.38\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. $\\ln(C_{res}) = -0.9676$.\n\nNow, we perform a linear regression on $\\ln(C_{res})$ vs. $t$ for these four points:\n- $n = 4$\n- $\\sum t_i = 0.5 + 1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0 = 6.5$\n- $\\sum \\ln(C_{res, i}) = 1.7699 + 1.2528 + 0.1906 - 0.9676 = 2.2457$\n- $\\sum t_i^2 = 0.5^2 + 1.0^2 + 2.0^2 + 3.0^2 = 0.25 + 1.0 + 4.0 + 9.0 = 14.25$\n- $\\sum t_i \\ln(C_{res, i}) = (0.5)(1.7699) + (1.0)(1.2528) + (2.0)(0.1906) + (3.0)(-0.9676) = 0.8850 + 1.2528 + 0.3812 - 2.9028 = -0.3838$\n\nThe slope, $m' = -k_a$, is:\n$$ m' = \\frac{n \\sum(t_i \\ln(C_{res, i})) - (\\sum t_i)(\\sum \\ln(C_{res, i}))}{n \\sum t_i^2 - (\\sum t_i)^2} = \\frac{4(-0.3838) - (6.5)(2.2457)}{4(14.25) - (6.5)^2} = \\frac{-1.5352 - 14.5971}{57 - 42.25} = \\frac{-16.1323}{14.75} \\approx -1.0937 $$\nThus, $k_a = -m' \\approx 1.094\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. This value is very close to $1.00\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n\nOur analysis yields the pair $(k, k_a) \\approx (0.20\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}, 1.09\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1})$.\n\nA final check can be performed by calculating the theoretical time to maximum concentration, $t_{max}$, given by $t_{max} = \\frac{\\ln(k_a/k)}{k_a - k}$. Using the pair $(0.20, 1.00)$:\n$$ t_{max} = \\frac{\\ln(1.00/0.20)}{1.00 - 0.20} = \\frac{\\ln(5)}{0.80} = \\frac{1.6094}{0.80} \\approx 2.01\\ \\mathrm{h} $$\nThe data shows the maximum measured concentration at $t = 2.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$, which is an excellent agreement.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $k = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $k_a = 1.00\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$**\nOur detailed calculation using the method of residuals yielded $k \\approx 0.198\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ and $k_a \\approx 1.094\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. The values in this option are the closest to our derived estimates. Furthermore, the calculated $t_{max}$ of $2.01\\ \\mathrm{h}$ using these parameters perfectly matches the observed peak in the data at $t=2.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$. The condition $k_a  k$ is satisfied. This option is a very strong match.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $k = 0.30\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $k_a = 1.00\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$**\nThe value of $k = 0.30\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ is significantly different from our calculated value of $\\approx 0.20\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. A value of $k=0.30$ would imply a terminal half-life of $t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/0.30 \\approx 2.3\\ \\mathrm{h}$. The data shows the concentration falls from $2.02\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$ at $t=8\\ \\mathrm{h}$ to $0.91\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$ at $t=12\\ \\mathrm{h}$, taking $4$ hours to decrease by half, which is inconsistent with a $2.3\\ \\mathrm{h}$ half-life.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $k = 1.00\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $k_a = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$**\nThis option violates the explicit condition $k_a  k$ stated in the problem ($0.20 \\ngtr 1.00$). The method of residuals as described is invalid if this condition is not met, as the terminal phase would be absorption-rate limited (\"flip-flop\" kinetics), and the slope would correspond to $k_a$, not $k$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $k = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, $k_a = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$**\nThe value of $k$ is consistent, but the value of $k_a=0.50\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ is not consistent with our residual analysis, which gave $k_a \\approx 1.1\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. We can check this by calculating the theoretical $t_{max}$:\n$$ t_{max} = \\frac{\\ln(0.50/0.20)}{0.50 - 0.20} = \\frac{\\ln(2.5)}{0.30} = \\frac{0.9163}{0.30} \\approx 3.05\\ \\mathrm{h} $$\nThis predicted peak time of $\\approx 3.05\\ \\mathrm{h}$ is inconsistent with the data, where the concentration is already declining at $t=3.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$ after peaking at $t=2.0\\ \\mathrm{h}$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4591354"}]}
