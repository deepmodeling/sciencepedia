It describes a standard one-compartment intravenous (IV) bolus model under the conditions of linear pharmacokinetics, which is a fundamental concept in pharmacology. The provided information is complete and consistent, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe core principle of linear pharmacokinetics is that exposure parameters, such as the maximum plasma concentration ($C_{max}$) and the area under the concentration-time curve ($AUC$), are directly proportional to the administered dose ($D$). We can demonstrate this using fundamental definitions and mass-balance relationships. The problem defines \"fold-change\" as the ratio of a metric after the second dose ($D_2$) to the same metric after the first dose ($D_1$).\n\nFirst, let us analyze the maximum concentration, $C_{max}$. For a single-dose IV bolus administration, the entire dose is assumed to be delivered instantaneously into the central compartment volume, $V$. The maximum concentration is achieved at time $t=0$, immediately after administration. By a simple mass-balance definition, the initial concentration $C(0)$ is the amount of drug (the dose, $D$) divided by the volume it distributes into ($V$).\n$$C_{max} = C(0) = \\frac{D}{V}$$\nThe problem states that the pharmacokinetics are linear and that structural parameters are dose-independent. This means the volume of distribution, $V$, is a constant for the subject and does not change between the two administrations.\n\nFor the first dose, $D_1 = 180$ mg, the maximum concentration is:\n$$C_{max,1} = \\frac{D_1}{V}$$\nFor the second dose, $D_2 = 600$ mg, the maximum concentration is:\n$$C_{max,2} = \\frac{D_2}{V}$$\nThe fold-change in $C_{max}$ is the ratio of $C_{max,2}$ to $C_{max,1}$:\n$$\\text{Fold-change}(C_{max}) = \\frac{C_{max,2}}{C_{max,1}} = \\frac{\\frac{D_2}{V}}{\\frac{D_1}{V}} = \\frac{D_2}{D_1}$$\nSubstituting the given dose values:\n$$\\text{Fold-change}(C_{max}) = \\frac{600 \\text{ mg}}{180 \\text{ mg}} = \\frac{60}{18} = \\frac{10}{3}$$\n\nNext, let us analyze the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity, $AUC_{0-\\infty}$ (hereafter denoted as $AUC$). A fundamental mass-balance principle states that for a single dose, the total amount of drug eliminated from the body must equal the dose administered, $D$.\nThe rate of drug elimination from the body is related to the plasma concentration, $C(t)$, through the parameter of clearance, $CL$.\n$$\\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL \\cdot C(t)$$\nThe total amount of drug eliminated over all time is the integral of this rate from $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$:\n$$\\text{Total Amount Eliminated} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} CL \\cdot C(t) \\,dt$$\nThe problem specifies that elimination follows time-invariant first-order processes, which is a hallmark of linear pharmacokinetics. This implies that clearance, $CL$, is a constant and does not depend on the dose or concentration. Therefore, $CL$ can be moved outside the integral:\n$$\\text{Total Amount Eliminated} = CL \\cdot \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t) \\,dt$$\nThe integral term, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t) \\,dt$, is the definition of $AUC$. Thus:\n$$\\text{Total Amount Eliminated} = CL \\cdot AUC$$\nEquating the total amount eliminated with the dose administered gives the fundamental relationship:\n$$D = CL \\cdot AUC$$\nThis can be rearranged to express $AUC$ in terms of dose and clearance:\n$$AUC = \\frac{D}{CL}$$\nFor the first dose, $D_1 = 180$ mg, the $AUC$ is:\n$$AUC_1 = \\frac{D_1}{CL}$$\nFor the second dose, $D_2 = 600$ mg, the $AUC$ is:\n$$AUC_2 = \\frac{D_2}{CL}$$\nThe fold-change in $AUC$ is the ratio of $AUC_2$ to $AUC_1$. Since $CL$ is constant:\n$$\\text{Fold-change}(AUC) = \\frac{AUC_2}{AUC_1} = \\frac{\\frac{D_2}{CL}}{\\frac{D_1}{CL}} = \\frac{D_2}{D_1}$$\nThis is the same ratio as for $C_{max}$.\n$$\\text{Fold-change}(AUC) = \\frac{600 \\text{ mg}}{180 \\text{ mg}} = \\frac{10}{3}$$\nTherefore, under conditions of linear pharmacokinetics, both $C_{max}$ and $AUC$ scale directly and proportionally with the dose. The fold-change in both metrics is equal to the fold-change in the dose.
