The derivation will start from the principle of mass conservation.\n\nLet $A(t)$ be the amount of drug in the central compartment at time $t$. The principle of mass conservation states that the rate of change of the amount of drug in the compartment is equal to the rate at which the drug enters the compartment minus the rate at which it leaves.\n$$ \\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = \\text{Rate In} - \\text{Rate Out} $$\n\nThe drug enters the compartment via a constant-rate infusion, so the rate of administration is constant and given by $R_{0}$.\n$$ \\text{Rate In} = R_{0} $$\n\nThe drug is eliminated from the compartment. The problem states that the elimination process is characterized by systemic clearance, $CL$, defined as the proportionality constant between the elimination rate and the drug concentration, $C(t)$.\n$$ \\text{Rate Out} = CL \\cdot C(t) $$\n\nSubstituting these rates into the mass balance equation gives the governing differential equation for the amount of drug in the body:\n$$ \\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = R_{0} - CL \\cdot C(t) $$\n\nThe problem defines steady-state ($ss$) as the condition where the net rate of change of the drug amount in the body is zero. At steady-state, the amount of drug in the body is constant, and thus the concentration is also constant. Let this steady-state concentration be denoted by $C_{ss}$. The steady-state condition is mathematically expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = 0 $$\n\nApplying this condition to the mass balance equation, we find that at steady-state, the rate of administration must equal the rate of elimination:\n$$ R_{0} - CL \\cdot C_{ss} = 0 $$\n$$ R_{0} = CL \\cdot C_{ss} $$\n\nTo find the analytical expression for $C_{ss}$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$ C_{ss} = \\frac{R_{0}}{CL} $$\nThis is the fundamental equation for steady-state concentration under constant intravenous infusion and linear elimination kinetics.\n\nNext, we evaluate $C_{ss}$ numerically using the provided values: the infusion rate is $R_{0} = 10$ mg/h and the systemic clearance is $CL = 5$ L/h.\n$$ C_{ss} = \\frac{10 \\text{ mg/h}}{5 \\text{ L/h}} $$\nThe units of hours (h) in the numerator and denominator cancel, yielding the concentration in mg/L.\n$$ C_{ss} = 2 \\text{ mg/L} $$\n\nThe problem then asks for an interpretation of this result with respect to a given therapeutic window of $1$–$3$ mg/L. The calculated steady-state concentration is $C_{ss} = 2$ mg/L. Since the value $2$ is between $1$ and $3$, i.e., $1 \\text{ mg/L} \\leq C_{ss} \\leq 3 \\text{ mg/L}$, the resulting steady-state concentration falls within the desired therapeutic window for this patient.\n\nFinally, we comment on the dependency of $C_{ss}$ on the model parameters within the assumptions of linear pharmacokinetics. The derived expression $C_{ss} = R_{0}/CL$ reveals a simple and direct relationship:\n1.  The steady-state concentration $C_{ss}$ is directly proportional to the infusion rate $R_{0}$. If all other parameters remain constant, doubling the infusion rate will double the steady-state concentration. This allows for straightforward dose adjustments to target a desired concentration.\n2.  The steady-state concentration $C_{ss}$ is inversely proportional to the clearance $CL$. This means that a patient's ability to eliminate the drug significantly impacts the resulting concentration. For instance, a patient with renal or hepatic impairment might have a lower clearance value, which would lead to a higher $C_{ss}$ for a given $R_{0}$, potentially increasing the risk of toxicity. Conversely, an individual with higher clearance (e.g., due to genetic factors or drug-drug interactions that induce metabolic enzymes) would have a lower $C_{ss}$, possibly resulting in a sub-therapeutic effect. This inverse proportionality is a key characteristic of linear kinetics.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "4593661"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a continuous infusion to intermittent dosing introduces the important phenomenon of drug accumulation. This exercise challenges you to quantify this effect by deriving the accumulation index, $R$, a powerful predictor of how high drug concentrations will rise with repeated doses.

It represents a standard derivation in clinical pharmacokinetics. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the accumulation index, $R$, based on first principles. The two specified principles are the definition of half-life for first-order elimination and the principle of superposition for linear systems.\n\nFirst, let's establish the relationship between the elimination rate constant, $k_e$, and the half-life, $t_{1/2}$. For a first-order elimination process, the concentration of a drug, $C(t)$, at time $t$ after an initial concentration $C_0$ is given by:\n$$C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-k_e t)$$\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time it takes for the concentration to decrease to half of its initial value. Thus, at $t = t_{1/2}$, $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}C_0$.\n$$\\frac{1}{2} C_0 = C_0 \\exp(-k_e t_{1/2})$$\nDividing by $C_0$ (which is non-zero) and taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_e t_{1/2}$$\n$$-\\ln(2) = -k_e t_{1/2}$$\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\nThis equation connects the elimination rate constant to the half-life.\n\nNext, we apply the principle of superposition to a multiple-dosing regimen. The drug is administered in identical doses at a fixed interval $\\tau$. Let the peak concentration immediately after the first dose be $C_{1,\\text{max}}$. The concentration of the drug from this single dose at any subsequent time $t$ is $C(t) = C_{1,\\text{max}} \\exp(-k_e t)$.\n\nThe trough concentration just before the second dose (at $t=\\tau$) is the residual from the first dose:\n$$C_{1,\\text{trough}} = C_{1,\\text{max}} \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\nAccording to the principle of superposition, the peak concentration immediately after the second dose, $C_{2,\\text{max}}$, is the sum of the concentration from the new dose ($C_{1,\\text{max}}$) and the residual concentration from the first dose:\n$$C_{2,\\text{max}} = C_{1,\\text{max}} + C_{1,\\text{trough}} = C_{1,\\text{max}} + C_{1,\\text{max}} \\exp(-k_e \\tau) = C_{1,\\text{max}} (1 + \\exp(-k_e \\tau))$$\nSimilarly, the peak concentration after the third dose, $C_{3,\\text{max}}$, is the sum of the concentration from the new dose and the residual concentration from all previous doses:\n$$C_{3,\\text{max}} = C_{1,\\text{max}} + C_{2,\\text{max}} \\exp(-k_e \\tau) = C_{1,\\text{max}} + C_{1,\\text{max}}(1 + \\exp(-k_e \\tau))\\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\n$$C_{3,\\text{max}} = C_{1,\\text{max}} (1 + \\exp(-k_e \\tau) + \\exp(-2k_e \\tau))$$\nBy induction, the peak concentration after the $n$-th dose is given by the sum of a geometric series:\n$$C_{n,\\text{max}} = C_{1,\\text{max}} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (\\exp(-k_e \\tau))^i$$\nSteady state is reached after a sufficient number of doses, theoretically as $n \\to \\infty$. The steady-state peak concentration, $C_{\\text{ss,max}}$, is the limit of $C_{n,\\text{max}}$ as $n \\to \\infty$. Since $k_e > 0$ and $\\tau > 0$, the common ratio of the series, $\\exp(-k_e \\tau)$, is between $0$ and $1$, so the infinite series converges.\n$$C_{\\text{ss,max}} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} C_{n,\\text{max}} = C_{1,\\text{max}} \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} (\\exp(-k_e \\tau))^i = C_{1,\\text{max}} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)} \\right)$$\nThe accumulation index, $R$, is defined as the ratio $R = \\frac{C_{\\text{ss,max}}}{C_{1,\\text{max}}}$.\n$$R = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)}$$\nTo express $R$ in terms of $t_{1/2}$ and $\\tau$, we substitute $k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$:\n$$R = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} \\tau\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(2^{-\\tau/t_{1/2}}\\right)\\right)}$$\n$$R = \\frac{1}{1 - 2^{-\\tau/t_{1/2}}}$$\nThis is the derived expression for $R$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the given parameters: $t_{1/2} = 12\\,\\mathrm{h}$ and $\\tau = 8\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\nThe ratio of the dosing interval to the half-life is $\\frac{\\tau}{t_{1/2}} = \\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n$$R = \\frac{1}{1 - 2^{-2/3}}$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$R = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2^2}}} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{4}}}$$\n$$R \\approx \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{1}{1.587401...}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 - 0.6299605...} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.3700395...} \\approx 2.702400...$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the numerical value is $R \\approx 2.702$.\n\nFinally, the qualitative explanation of this result is as follows. The calculated accumulation index $R \\approx 2.702$ has direct clinical implications.\nBy its definition, $R = \\frac{C_{\\text{ss,max}}}{C_{1,\\text{max}}}$, so a value of approximately $2.702$ means that the peak concentration at steady state is about $2.7$ times higher than the peak concentration achieved after the first dose. This signifies substantial accumulation of the drug. This accumulation occurs because the dosing interval ($\\tau = 8\\,\\mathrm{h}$) is shorter than the elimination half-life ($t_{1/2} = 12\\,\\mathrm{h}$), meaning the drug is administered more frequently than it takes for half of the drug to be eliminated.\n\nFurthermore, we can analyze the steady-state trough concentration, $C_{\\text{ss,trough}}$. At steady state, the concentration profile repeats every dosing interval. The peak concentration after a dose, $C_{\\text{ss,max}}$, is the sum of the trough concentration just before that dose, $C_{\\text{ss,trough}}$, and the concentration increase from the dose, which is equal to $C_{1,\\text{max}}$.\n$$C_{\\text{ss,max}} = C_{\\text{ss,trough}} + C_{1,\\text{max}}$$\nRearranging this gives an expression for the steady-state trough:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,trough}} = C_{\\text{ss,max}} - C_{1,\\text{max}}$$\nSubstituting $C_{\\text{ss,max}} = R \\cdot C_{1,\\text{max}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,trough}} = (R - 1) C_{1,\\text{max}}$$\nWith $R \\approx 2.702$, we find $C_{\\text{ss,trough}} \\approx (2.702 - 1) C_{1,\\text{max}} = 1.702 \\cdot C_{1,\\text{max}}$.\nThis is a critical insight: the *minimum* drug concentration at steady state is approximately $1.7$ times greater than the *maximum* concentration achieved after the very first dose. This highlights that for drugs with $\\tau < t_{1/2}$, not only does the peak concentration increase significantly to reach steady state, but the entire concentration range shifts upwards, such that even the lowest level during a steady-state interval is well above the initial peak.
