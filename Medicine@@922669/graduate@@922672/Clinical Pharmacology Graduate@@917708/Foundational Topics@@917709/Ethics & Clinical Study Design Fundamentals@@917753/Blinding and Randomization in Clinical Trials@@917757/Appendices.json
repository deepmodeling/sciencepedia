The primary endpoint is systolic blood pressure at week $12$ (in mmHg), where lower values are better. At a particular site, allocation uses a quasi-randomized, fully predictable scheme: permuted blocks of size $2$ with a known fixed order within each block (one drug slot and one placebo slot). Because the within-block order is known, the recruiter can influence which of the next two eligible participants is enrolled first. Assume the following data-generating model for each participant $i$:\n$$\nY_i \\;=\\; \\mu \\;+\\; \\tau Z_i \\;+\\; \\beta X_i \\;+\\; \\varepsilon_i,\n$$\nwhere $Y_i$ is systolic blood pressure at week $12$ (mmHg), $Z_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicates assignment to drug ($Z_i=1$) or placebo ($Z_i=0$), $X_i$ is a continuous baseline prognostic score with $X_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\!\\left(0,\\sigma_X^2\\right)$, and $\\varepsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)$ is independent of $X_i$ and $Z_i$.

The data-generating model for the systolic blood pressure $Y_i$ of participant $i$ is given by:\n$$\nY_i = \\mu + \\tau Z_i + \\beta X_i + \\varepsilon_i\n$$\nwhere $Z_i=1$ for the drug arm and $Z_i=0$ for the placebo arm, $X_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_X^2)$ is a prognostic score, and $\\varepsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$ is an error term. The naive estimator of the treatment effect $\\tau$ is the simple difference in mean outcomes:\n$$\n\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{naive}} = \\bar{Y}_{\\text{drug}} - \\bar{Y}_{\\text{placebo}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i: Z_i=1} Y_i}{N_{\\text{drug}}} - \\frac{\\sum_{j: Z_j=0} Y_j}{N_{\\text{placebo}}}\n$$\nwhere $N_{\\text{drug}}$ and $N_{\\text{placebo}}$ are the number of participants in the drug and placebo arms, respectively. Since the trial design is balanced, $N_{\\text{drug}} = N_{\\text{placebo}}$.\n\nWe need to compute the expected value of this estimator, $E[\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{naive}}]$. By the linearity of expectation,\n$$\nE[\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{naive}}] = E[\\bar{Y}_{\\text{drug}}] - E[\\bar{Y}_{\\text{placebo}}]\n$$\nThe expectation of the sample mean is the expectation of a single observation from that group. Let's find the expected outcome for a participant in the drug arm and one in the placebo arm.\nFor a participant in the drug arm ($Z_i=1$):\n$$\nE[Y_i | Z_i=1] = E[\\mu + \\tau(1) + \\beta X_i + \\varepsilon_i | Z_i=1] = \\mu + \\tau + \\beta E[X_i | Z_i=1] + E[\\varepsilon_i]\n$$\nSince $\\varepsilon_i$ is independent of treatment assignment, $E[\\varepsilon_i]=0$.\n$$\nE[Y_i | Z_i=1] = \\mu + \\tau + \\beta E[X_i | Z_i=1]\n$$\nSimilarly, for a participant in the placebo arm ($Z_i=0$):\n$$\nE[Y_i | Z_i=0] = E[\\mu + \\tau(0) + \\beta X_i + \\varepsilon_i | Z_i=0] = \\mu + \\beta E[X_i | Z_i=0]\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $E[\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{naive}}]$:\n$$\nE[\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{naive}}] = (\\mu + \\tau + \\beta E[X_i|Z_i=1]) - (\\mu + \\beta E[X_i|Z_i=0])\n$$\n$$\nE[\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{naive}}] = \\tau + \\beta (E[X_i|Z_i=1] - E[X_i|Z_i=0])\n$$\nThe term $\\beta (E[X_i|Z_i=1] - E[X_i|Z_i=0])$ represents the bias in the estimation due to systematic differences in the prognostic score $X_i$ between the treatment arms. Our task is to calculate this difference.\n\nThe assignment process is described at the block level. There are two types of blocks:\n1.  Selection blocks (fraction $\\rho=0.6$): The recruiter channels the participant with the lower score to the drug and the higher score to placebo.\n2.  No-selection blocks (fraction $1-\\rho=0.4$): The assignment is made without regard to the scores.\n\nLet's find the conditional expectations $E[X_i|Z_i=1]$ and $E[X_i|Z_i=0]$ using the law of total expectation, conditioning on the type of block.\nLet $S=1$ denote a selection block and $S=0$ a no-selection block.\n$$\nE[X_i|Z_i=1] = E[X_{\\text{drug}}] = E[X_{\\text{drug}}|S=1]P(S=1) + E[X_{\\text{drug}}|S=0]P(S=0)\n$$\n$$\nE[X_i|Z_i=0] = E[X_{\\text{placebo}}] = E[X_{\\text{placebo}}|S=1]P(S=1) + E[X_{\\text{placebo}}|S=0]P(S=0)\n$$\n\nIn a no-selection block ($S=0$), the assignment is independent of the prognostic scores $X_1$ and $X_2$.

The participant with the lower score, $\\min(X_1, X_2)$, is assigned to the drug arm, and the one with the higher score, $\\max(X_1, X_2)$, to the placebo arm. We need to find the expected values of these order statistics, denoted $X_{(1)}$ and $X_{(2)}$.\nLet $U_1, U_2$ be independent random variables from a standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. The corresponding order statistics are $U_{(1)}$ and $U_{(2)}$. The expected value of the maximum of two standard normal variables is known to be $E[U_{(2)}] = 1/\\sqrt{\\pi}$.\nSince $U_{(1)} + U_{(2)} = U_1 + U_2$, we have $E[U_{(1)}] + E[U_{(2)}] = E[U_1] + E[U_2] = 0+0=0$.\nThus, $E[U_{(1)}] = -E[U_{(2)}] = -1/\\sqrt{\\pi}$.\nThe prognostic score $X_i$ is distributed as $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_X^2)$, which can be written as $X_i = 0 + \\sigma_X U_i$, where $U_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.\nThe expected values of the order statistics for $X_1, X_2$ are:\n$$\nE[X_{(1)}] = E[\\sigma_X U_{(1)}] = \\sigma_X E[U_{(1)}] = -\\frac{\\sigma_X}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\n$$\nE[X_{(2)}] = E[\\sigma_X U_{(2)}] = \\sigma_X E[U_{(2)}] = \\frac{\\sigma_X}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\nSo, in a selection block:\n$$\nE[X_{\\text{drug}}|S=1] = E[X_{(1)}] = -\\frac{\\sigma_X}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\n$$\nE[X_{\\text{placebo}}|S=1] = E[X_{(2)}] = \\frac{\\sigma_X}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\n\nNow we combine these results using the law of total expectation.\n$$\nE[X_{\\text{drug}}] = \\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_X}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\right)\\rho + (0)(1-\\rho) = -\\frac{\\rho\\sigma_X}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\n$$\nE[X_{\\text{placebo}}] = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_X}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\right)\\rho + (0)(1-\\rho) = \\frac{\\rho\\sigma_X}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\nThe difference in expected prognostic scores is:\n$$\nE[X_{\\text{drug}}] - E[X_{\\text{placebo}}] = -\\frac{\\rho\\sigma_X}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} - \\frac{\\rho\\sigma_X}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} = -2\\frac{\\rho\\sigma_X}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this back into the expression for $E[\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{naive}}]$:\n$$\nE[\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{naive}}] = \\tau + \\beta \\left(-2\\frac{\\rho\\sigma_X}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\right) = \\tau - \\frac{2\\beta\\rho\\sigma_X}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\nNow, we plug in the given numerical values: $\\tau = -5$, $\\beta = 1.5$, $\\rho = 0.6$, and $\\sigma_X = 1.2$.\n$$\nE[\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{naive}}] = -5 - \\frac{2(1.5)(0.6)(1.2)}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\n$$\nE[\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{naive}}] = -5 - \\frac{2.16}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\nUsing the value of $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, we have $\\sqrt{\\pi} \\approx 1.77245$.\n$$\nE[\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{naive}}] \\approx -5 - \\frac{2.16}{1.77245} \\approx -5 - 1.21859\n$$\n$$\nE[\\hat{\\tau}_{\\text{naive}}] \\approx -6.21859\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe value is $-6.21859$.

The likelihood function for this observation is:\n$$\nL(\\theta_j | x_j) = \\binom{n_j}{x_j} \\theta_j^{x_j} (1-\\theta_j)^{n_j - x_j}\n$$\nThe standard MLE for the probability parameter $\\theta_j$ of a binomial distribution is the sample proportion of successes:\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta}_j = \\frac{x_j}{n_j}\n$$\nBy the invariance property of maximum likelihood estimators, the MLE for $u_j$, denoted $\\hat{u}_j$, is obtained by substituting $\\hat{\\theta}_j$ into the expression for $u_j$:\n$$\n\\hat{u}_j = \\frac{\\hat{\\theta}_j - \\frac{1}{2}}{p_u - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{x_j}{n_j} - \\frac{1}{2}}{p_u - \\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\nNow, we can apply this formula to each arm using the provided data.\n\nGiven values are:\n- Active arm: $n_A = 150$, $x_A = 102$.\n- Placebo arm: $n_P = 150$, $x_P = 86$.\n- Probability of correct guess for unblinded participant: $p_u = 0.85$.\n\nFirst, for the active arm ($j=A$):\nThe MLE for the probability of a correct guess is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta}_A = \\frac{x_A}{n_A} = \\frac{102}{150} = 0.68\n$$\nThe MLE for the proportion of unblinded participants in the active arm is:\n$$\n\\hat{u}_A = \\frac{\\hat{\\theta}_A - \\frac{1}{2}}{p_u - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{0.68 - 0.5}{0.85 - 0.5} = \\frac{0.18}{0.35} = \\frac{18}{35}\n$$\n\nNext, for the placebo arm ($j=P$):\nThe MLE for the probability of a correct guess is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta}_P = \\frac{x_P}{n_P} = \\frac{86}{150} = \\frac{43}{75}\n$$\nThe MLE for the proportion of unblinded participants in the placebo arm is:\n$$\n\\hat{u}_P = \\frac{\\hat{\\theta}_P - \\frac{1}{2}}{p_u - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{43}{75} - \\frac{1}{2}}{0.35} = \\frac{\\frac{86}{150} - \\frac{75}{150}}{0.35} = \\frac{\\frac{11}{150}}{0.35} = \\frac{11}{150 \\times 0.35} = \\frac{11}{52.5} = \\frac{22}{105}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the overall estimated proportion of unblinded participants, $\\hat{u}$, using the given weighted average formula:\n$$\n\\hat{u} = \\frac{n_A \\hat{u}_A + n_P \\hat{u}_P}{n_A + n_P}\n$$\nSince $n_A = n_P = 150$, this simplifies to the arithmetic mean of $\\hat{u}_A$ and $\\hat{u}_P$:\n$$\n\\hat{u} = \\frac{150 \\hat{u}_A + 150 \\hat{u}_P}{150 + 150} = \\frac{\\hat{u}_A + \\hat{u}_P}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived values:\n$$\n\\hat{u} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{18}{35} + \\frac{22}{105}\\right)\n$$\nTo add the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $105$:\n$$\n\\hat{u} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{18 \\times 3}{35 \\times 3} + \\frac{22}{105}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{54}{105} + \\frac{22}{105}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{76}{105}\\right) = \\frac{38}{105}\n$$\nTo provide the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\n\\hat{u} = \\frac{38}{105} \\approx 0.36190476...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.3619$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3619}$$", "id": "4526545"}]}
