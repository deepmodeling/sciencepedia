Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling predicts a human systemic clearance (CL) of $7.2$ L/h. A once-every-$12$-hour dosing interval, denoted by $\\tau = 12$ h, is planned. The formulation has sustained input designed to minimize peak-to-trough fluctuation; the predicted terminal half-life is $t_{1/2} = 18$ h, which is longer than the dosing interval ($t_{1/2} > \\tau$), so the steady-state trough concentration is expected to be close to the steady-state average concentration, with deviation under approximately $10\\%$.

At steady state ($ss$), the rate at which the drug is administered and absorbed into the systemic circulation must equal the rate at which it is eliminated from the body.\n\nThe average rate of drug administration into the systemic circulation (Rate In) for an oral drug with dose $D$, dosing interval $\\tau$, and oral bioavailability $F$ is given by:\n$$ \\text{Rate In} = \\frac{F \\times D}{\\tau} $$\nThe average rate of drug elimination from the body (Rate Out) is the product of the systemic clearance ($CL$) and the average steady-state plasma concentration ($C_{\\text{ss,avg}}$):\n$$ \\text{Rate Out} = CL \\times C_{\\text{ss,avg}} $$\nAt steady state, we equate these two rates:\n$$ \\frac{F \\times D}{\\tau} = CL \\times C_{\\text{ss,avg}} $$\nThe problem asks to calculate the dose $D$ required to achieve a target steady-state trough concentration ($C_{\\text{ss,trough}}$) of $1.1$ mg/L. A crucial piece of information is that the drug's predicted terminal half-life ($t_{1/2} = 18$ h) is longer than the dosing interval ($\\tau = 12$ h). For an extended-release formulation under such conditions ($t_{1/2} > \\tau$), the fluctuation between peak and trough concentrations at steady state is minimal. The problem statement formalizes this by providing the approximation that the trough concentration is nearly equal to the average concentration:\n$$ C_{\\text{ss,trough}} \\approx C_{\\text{ss,avg}} $$\nTherefore, we can set our target average steady-state concentration to be the target trough concentration:\n$$ C_{\\text{ss,avg}} = 1.1 \\, \\text{mg/L} $$\nNow, we can solve the steady-state mass balance equation for the dose $D$:\n$$ D = \\frac{CL \\times C_{\\text{ss,avg}} \\times \\tau}{F} $$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Systemic clearance, $CL = 7.2$ L/h\n- Dosing interval, $\\tau = 12$ h\n- Target average concentration, $C_{\\text{ss,avg}} = 1.1$ mg/L\n- Nominal oral bioavailability, $F = 0.42$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for the dose:\n$$ D = \\frac{(7.2 \\, \\text{L/h}) \\times (1.1 \\, \\text{mg/L}) \\times (12 \\, \\text{h})}{0.42} $$\nThe units are consistent: $\\frac{(\\text{L/h}) \\times (\\text{mg/L}) \\times \\text{h}}{\\text{dimensionless}} = \\text{mg}$.\n$$ D = \\frac{95.04 \\, \\text{mg}}{0.42} $$\n$$ D = 226.285714... \\, \\text{mg} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the required dose is $226.3$ mg.\n\nRegarding the sensitivity of the required dose to the uncertainty in oral bioavailability ($F$), the dose equation $D = \\frac{CL \\times C_{\\text{ss,avg}} \\times \\tau}{F}$ shows that $D$ is inversely proportional to $F$. This inverse relationship is a critical consideration in first-in-human (FIH) planning. The plausible range for $F$ is given as $0.30$ to $0.60$. This uncertainty in $F$ translates directly into a wide range of possible doses required to achieve the therapeutic target. For instance:\n- If $F = 0.30$ (worst-case absorption): $D = \\frac{95.04}{0.30} = 316.8$ mg.\n- If $F = 0.60$ (best-case absorption): $D = \\frac{95.04}{0.60} = 158.4$ mg.\nThe dose required to meet the target concentration could be nearly $40\\%$ higher or $30\\%$ lower than the dose calculated with the nominal $F$. This highlights a significant risk: if the true $F$ is higher than the nominal value of $0.42$, administering the calculated dose of $226.3$ mg could lead to unexpectedly high and potentially toxic concentrations. Conversely, if the true $F$ is lower, the dose may be sub-therapeutic.\n\nTo quantify the fractional change in the required dose if the true $F$ is $0.30$ instead of the nominal $0.42$, we can calculate the ratio. Let $D_{nominal}$ be the dose for $F_{nominal} = 0.42$ and $D_{new}$ be the dose for $F_{new} = 0.30$.\n$$ \\text{Fractional Change} = \\frac{D_{new} - D_{nominal}}{D_{nominal}} $$\nSince $D$ is proportional to $1/F$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Change} = \\frac{\\frac{k}{F_{new}} - \\frac{k}{F_{nominal}}}{\\frac{k}{F_{nominal}}} = \\frac{F_{nominal}}{F_{new}} - 1 $$\nwhere $k = CL \\times C_{\\text{ss,avg}} \\times \\tau$.\n$$ \\text{Fractional Change} = \\frac{0.42}{0.30} - 1 = 1.4 - 1 = 0.4 $$\nA bioavailability of $0.30$ instead of $0.42$ would require a $40\\%$ increase in the dose to achieve the same target steady-state concentration.

It is based on established principles of clinical pharmacokinetics and presents a realistic clinical scenario for dose adjustment in renal impairment. The data provided are self-contained, consistent, and sufficient to derive the required expressions, perform the calculations, and critically evaluate the underlying assumptions. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution will be presented in three parts as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the General Expression for Maintenance Dose\n\nThe average steady-state plasma concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}}$, is defined as the state where the rate of drug administration into the systemic circulation equals the rate of drug elimination from the systemic circulation.\n\nFor an orally administered drug with bioavailability $F$, given at a maintenance dose $D$ every dosing interval $\\tau$, the average rate of drug input is $\\frac{F \\cdot D}{\\tau}$.\nThe average rate of elimination is the product of the total systemic clearance $CL$ and the average steady-state concentration $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}}$.\nEquating these rates gives the fundamental relationship:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} \\cdot CL = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{\\tau}$$\nThis can be rearranged to express the average steady-state concentration:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL \\cdot \\tau}$$\nThe objective is to find a new maintenance dose, $D_{\\mathrm{new}}$, for a target patient (new) that achieves the same average steady-state concentration as a reference regimen ($D_{\\mathrm{ref}}, \\tau, CL_{\\mathrm{ref}}$) in a healthy cohort (ref). Therefore, we set $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg,new}} = C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg,ref}}$.\n$$\\frac{F \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{new}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{new}} \\cdot \\tau} = \\frac{F \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\cdot \\tau}$$\nThe problem assumes that the bioavailability $F$ and the dosing interval $\\tau$ remain unchanged between the reference and target patient. Thus, these terms cancel out, yielding the general dose-adjustment principle:\n$$\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{new}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{new}}} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{ref}}}$$\n$$D_{\\mathrm{new}} = D_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\cdot \\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{new}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{ref}}}$$\nThe next step is to derive an expression for the new total clearance, $CL_{\\mathrm{new}}$. Total clearance is the sum of its renal ($CL_{\\mathrm{R}}$) and nonrenal ($CL_{\\mathrm{NR}}$) components:\n$$CL_{\\mathrm{new}} = CL_{\\mathrm{R,new}} + CL_{\\mathrm{NR,new}}$$\nThe problem states that nonrenal clearance is unchanged, so $CL_{\\mathrm{NR,new}} = CL_{\\mathrm{NR,ref}}$. It also states that renal clearance scales in direct proportion to the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate ($eGFR$) under non-saturating conditions. This means:\n$$\\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{R,new}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{R,ref}}} = \\frac{eGFR_{\\mathrm{new}}}{eGFR_{\\mathrm{ref}}}$$\nThus, the new renal clearance is:\n$$CL_{\\mathrm{R,new}} = CL_{\\mathrm{R,ref}} \\cdot \\frac{eGFR_{\\mathrm{new}}}{eGFR_{\\mathrm{ref}}}$$\nSubstituting these components into the expression for $CL_{\\mathrm{new}}$:\n$$CL_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\left( CL_{\\mathrm{R,ref}} \\cdot \\frac{eGFR_{\\mathrm{new}}}{eGFR_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\right) + CL_{\\mathrm{NR,ref}}$$\nFinally, substituting this expression for $CL_{\\mathrm{new}}$ into the dose adjustment formula provides the required general expression for $D_{\\mathrm{new}}$:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{new}} = D_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\cdot \\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{R,ref}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{eGFR_{\\mathrm{new}}}{eGFR_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right) + CL_{\\mathrm{NR,ref}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{ref}}}$$\nGiven that $CL_{\\mathrm{ref}} = CL_{\\mathrm{R,ref}} + CL_{\\mathrm{NR,ref}}$, the expression can also be written as:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{new}} = D_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\cdot \\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{R,ref}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{eGFR_{\\mathrm{new}}}{eGFR_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right) + CL_{\\mathrm{NR,ref}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{R,ref}} + CL_{\\mathrm{NR,ref}}}$$\nThis expression clearly shows how the new dose depends on the reference dose, the components of reference clearance, and the ratio of the new to reference $eGFR$.\n\n### Part 2: Computation of the New Maintenance Dose\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerical values for the components of the reference clearance.\nGiven:\n$CL_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 12\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}$\n$f_{\\mathrm{R}} = 0.70$\nReference renal clearance, $CL_{\\mathrm{R,ref}}$:\n$$CL_{\\mathrm{R,ref}} = f_{\\mathrm{R}} \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 0.70 \\cdot 12\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} = 8.4\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}$$\nReference nonrenal clearance, $CL_{\\mathrm{NR,ref}}$:\n$$CL_{\\mathrm{NR,ref}} = (1 - f_{\\mathrm{R}}) \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{ref}} = (1 - 0.70) \\cdot 12\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} = 0.30 \\cdot 12\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} = 3.6\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}$$\nNext, we calculate the new total clearance, $CL_{\\mathrm{new}}$, for the target patient.\nGiven:\n$eGFR_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}\\,1.73\\,m^{-2}}$\n$eGFR_{\\mathrm{new}} = 25\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}\\,1.73\\,m^{-2}}$\nThe scaling factor for renal clearance is:\n$$\\frac{eGFR_{\\mathrm{new}}}{eGFR_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{25}{100} = 0.25$$\nThe new renal clearance is:\n$$CL_{\\mathrm{R,new}} = CL_{\\mathrm{R,ref}} \\cdot \\frac{eGFR_{\\mathrm{new}}}{eGFR_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = 8.4\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} \\cdot 0.25 = 2.1\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}$$\nThe new total clearance is the sum of the new renal clearance and the unchanged nonrenal clearance:\n$$CL_{\\mathrm{new}} = CL_{\\mathrm{R,new}} + CL_{\\mathrm{NR,ref}} = 2.1\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} + 3.6\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} = 5.7\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}$$\nNow, we can compute the new maintenance dose, $D_{\\mathrm{new}}$, using the reference dose $D_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 300\\,\\mathrm{mg}$:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{new}} = D_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\cdot \\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{new}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = 300\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\cdot \\frac{5.7\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}}{12\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}}$$\n$$D_{\\mathrm{new}} = 300\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\cdot 0.475 = 142.5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe problem requires the final dose to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$D_{\\mathrm{new}} \\approx 143\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\n### Part 3: Assessment of the Proportionality Assumption\n\nThe assumption that renal clearance ($CL_{\\mathrm{R}}$) is proportional to $eGFR$ is valid only if the mechanisms of renal elimination (glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion) behave as first-order processes. Active transport, governed by Michaelis-Menten kinetics, approximates a first-order process when the unbound substrate concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{u}}$) is substantially lower than the Michaelis constant ($K_{\\mathrm{m}}$).\n\nFirst, let's assess this condition for the reference cohort by calculating the average unbound steady-state concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg,u,ref}}$.\nThe total average steady-state concentration is:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg,ref}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\cdot \\tau} = \\frac{0.50 \\cdot 300\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{12\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} \\cdot 12\\,\\mathrm{h}} = \\frac{150\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{144\\,\\mathrm{L}} \\approx 1.0417\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,L^{-1}}$$\nThe unbound concentration is this value multiplied by the unbound fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{u}} = 0.10$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg,u,ref}} = C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg,ref}} \\cdot f_{\\mathrm{u}} \\approx 1.0417\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,L^{-1}} \\cdot 0.10 \\approx 0.104\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,L^{-1}}$$\nWe compare this to the given Michaelis constant, $K_{\\mathrm{m}} = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,L^{-1}}$.\nThe ratio is:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg,u,ref}}}{K_{\\mathrm{m}}} \\approx \\frac{0.104\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,L^{-1}}}{0.50\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,L^{-1}}} \\approx 0.21$$\nThe average unbound concentration is approximately $21\\%$ of the $K_{\\mathrm{m}}$. While not negligible, this value may be considered low enough for the first-order approximation to be reasonably acceptable, though it indicates that some degree of saturation is occurring. The rate of a Michaelis-Menten process at $C_u = 0.21 K_m$ is $V_{max} \\frac{0.21 K_m}{K_m + 0.21 K_m} \\approx 0.17 V_{max}$, whereas a purely linear process would have a rate proportional to $0.21$. This represents a deviation of about $1 - (0.17/0.21) \\approx 19\\%$ from perfect linearity for the secretion component.\n\nTransporter saturation would more definitively invalidate the proportionality assumption under conditions where the distinct components of renal clearance do not scale uniformly with a change in $eGFR$.\nRenal clearance is the sum of filtration clearance and net secretion clearance: $CL_{\\mathrm{R}} = CL_{\\mathrm{filt}} + CL_{\\mathrm{sec}}$.\n$CL_{\\mathrm{filt}} = f_{\\mathrm{u}} \\cdot GFR$. This component is always linear and scales directly with $GFR$.\nThe clearance for active secretion, however, is concentration-dependent: $CL_{\\mathrm{sec}} = \\frac{\\text{Rate of secretion}}{C} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{max}} \\cdot f_{\\mathrm{u}}}{K_{\\mathrm{m}} + f_{\\mathrm{u}} \\cdot C}$.\nThe simple proportionality model, $CL_{\\mathrm{R}} \\propto eGFR$, implicitly assumes that $CL_{\\mathrm{filt}}$ and $CL_{\\mathrm{sec}}$ both scale with $eGFR$. This holds if $C_{\\mathrm{u}} \\ll K_{\\mathrm{m}}$ (linear region) and if the secretory capacity ($V_{\\mathrm{max}}$) is itself proportional to $eGFR$, which is a plausible biological assumption as both may reflect the number of functioning nephrons.\n\nThe proportionality assumption is invalidated by saturation under two key conditions:\n$1$. The concentration $C_{\\mathrm{u}}$ is a significant fraction of $K_{\\mathrm{m}}$, causing $CL_{\\mathrm{sec}}$ to be nonlinear.\n$2$. The pathological process of renal impairment disproportionately affects different parts of the nephron. The assumption that secretory capacity ($V_{\\mathrm{max}}$) declines in direct proportion to $GFR$ may not hold. For example, a tubulointerstitial disease might damage transporters and reduce $V_{\\mathrm{max}}$ more significantly than the decline in $GFR$. In this scenario, the total $CL_{\\mathrm{R}}$ would decrease more than predicted by the fall in $eGFR$ alone. Conversely, a primary glomerular disease might reduce $GFR$ with less impact on secretory capacity, causing $CL_{\\mathrm{R}}$ to decrease less than predicted. When concentrations are high enough to cause saturation, the system is nonlinear, and the overall clearance becomes much more sensitive to which component ($GFR$ or $V_{\\mathrm{max}}$) is more severely affected, thus breaking the simple proportionality to $eGFR$. In this specific problem, secretion is the dominant renal pathway (approximately $130\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}}$ of secretion vs. $10\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}}$ of filtration), so any deviation from proportional scaling of secretion would have a large impact on the total renal clearance.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{143} $$", "id": "4598078"}, {"introduction": "As a drug progresses towards late-stage development, the final task is to select the best dose for the market, a decision that demands a formal balancing of efficacy and safety across a population.

The optimization is performed over the feasible range $d \\in [0, 120]$ milligrams.\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative $\\frac{dU}{dd}$:\n$$\\frac{dU}{dd} = \\frac{d}{dd} \\left( \\frac{2.5d}{d+60} - 0.015d \\right)$$\nUsing the quotient rule for the first term, $\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$, where $u=2.5d$ and $v=d+60$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dd}\\left( \\frac{2.5d}{d+60} \\right) = \\frac{(2.5)(d+60) - (2.5d)(1)}{(d+60)^2} = \\frac{2.5d + 150 - 2.5d}{(d+60)^2} = \\frac{150}{(d+60)^2}$$\nThe derivative of the second term is:\n$$\\frac{d}{dd}(-0.015d) = -0.015$$\nCombining the terms, we get the full derivative:\n$$\\frac{dU}{dd} = \\frac{150}{(d+60)^2} - 0.015$$\n\nTo find the critical points, we set the derivative equal to zero:\n$$\\frac{150}{(d+60)^2} - 0.015 = 0$$\n$$\\frac{150}{(d+60)^2} = 0.015$$\n$$(d+60)^2 = \\frac{150}{0.015} = \\frac{150}{15/1000} = \\frac{150 \\times 1000}{15} = 10 \\times 1000 = 10000$$\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n$$d+60 = \\pm\\sqrt{10000} = \\pm 100$$\nThis yields two possible values for $d$:\n$1$. $d + 60 = 100 \\implies d = 100 - 60 = 40$\n$2$. $d + 60 = -100 \\implies d = -100 - 60 = -160$\n\nSince the dose $d$ must be a non-negative quantity, the solution $d = -160$ is not physically meaningful and is discarded. The only valid critical point is $d = 40$.\n\nTo confirm that this critical point corresponds to a maximum, we use the second derivative test. We compute the second derivative $\\frac{d^2U}{dd^2}$:\n$$\\frac{d^2U}{dd^2} = \\frac{d}{dd} \\left( \\frac{150}{(d+60)^2} - 0.015 \\right) = \\frac{d}{dd} \\left( 150(d+60)^{-2} \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{d^2U}{dd^2} = 150 \\times (-2)(d+60)^{-3} = \\frac{-300}{(d+60)^3}$$\nFor any non-negative dose $d \\ge 0$, the term $(d+60)^3$ is positive. Therefore, $\\frac{d^2U}{dd^2}$ is always negative for $d \\ge 0$. This indicates that the utility function $U(d)$ is strictly concave for all physically relevant doses, and the critical point $d = 40$ corresponds to a unique global maximum.\n\nFinally, we must check if this optimal dose lies within the feasible dose range specified in the problem, which is $d \\in [0, 120]$ milligrams. The calculated optimal dose $d^{\\ast} = 40$ is indeed within this interval. Because the function is concave and the unconstrained maximum is within the interval, it is also the maximum over that interval.\n\nThe question asks for the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The optimal dose is exactly $40$ milligrams, which is written as $40.0$ to show three significant figures of precision.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{40.0}$$", "id": "4598068"}]}
