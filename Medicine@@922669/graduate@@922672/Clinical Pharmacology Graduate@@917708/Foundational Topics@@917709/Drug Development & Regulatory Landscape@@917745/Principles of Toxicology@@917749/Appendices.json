It is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of pharmacokinetics, a sub-discipline of pharmacology and toxicology. It is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We may therefore proceed.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the concentration-time profile for a xenobiotic in a one-compartment model with first-order elimination, followed by a calculation of its half-life.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the governing expression for $C(t)$**\n\nWe begin with the principle of mass balance. For a single, well-mixed compartment, the rate of change of the amount of a substance, $A$, within the compartment is equal to the rate of input minus the rate of elimination.\n$$ \\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = \\text{Rate of Input} - \\text{Rate of Elimination} $$\nThe xenobiotic is administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus at time $t=0$. This means the entire dose is introduced instantaneously, so for any time $t > 0$, the rate of input is zero.\n$$ \\text{Rate of Input} = 0 \\quad (\\text{for } t > 0) $$\nThe problem states that elimination is a first-order process, meaning the rate of elimination is directly proportional to the amount of xenobiotic, $A(t)$, present in the body at time $t$.\n$$ \\text{Rate of Elimination} = k \\cdot A(t) $$\nHere, $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant, which has units of inverse time (e.g., $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, or $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$).\n\nSubstituting these into the mass balance equation gives the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the amount of xenobiotic in the body:\n$$ \\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -k \\cdot A(t) $$\nThe concentration of the xenobiotic, $C(t)$, is defined as the amount $A(t)$ divided by the volume of distribution, $V$.\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{A(t)}{V} $$\nSince $V$ is a constant, we can write $A(t) = V \\cdot C(t)$. Substituting this into the ODE:\n$$ \\frac{d(V \\cdot C(t))}{dt} = -k \\cdot (V \\cdot C(t)) $$\nBecause $V$ is constant, we can pull it out of the derivative:\n$$ V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k V C(t) $$\nDividing both sides by $V$ (assuming $V \\neq 0$) yields the differential equation for concentration:\n$$ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k C(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ODE. We can solve it by separation of variables. Let $C_0$ be the initial concentration at $t=0$.\n$$ \\frac{dC}{C} = -k \\, dt $$\nWe integrate both sides, from the initial condition $(t=0, C=C_0)$ to a later state $(t, C(t))$:\n$$ \\int_{C_0}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C'} dC' = \\int_0^t -k \\, dt' $$\n$$ [\\ln|C'|]_{C_0}^{C(t)} = [-kt']_0^t $$\n$$ \\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C_0) = -kt $$\nNote that concentration $C$ is a non-negative quantity.\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right) = -kt $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the governing expression for the time course of the concentration:\n$$ C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt) $$\nThe initial concentration $C_0$ is the dose, $D$, divided by the volume of distribution, $V$, so $C_0 = D/V$.\n\n**Part 2: Definitions and Relationships of Pharmacokinetic Parameters**\n\n1.  **Elimination Rate Constant ($k$)**: As introduced above, $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. It is the constant of proportionality that links the rate of drug elimination to the amount of drug in the body. It represents the fraction of the drug in the body that is eliminated per unit time. Its units are inverse time (e.g., $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$).\n\n2.  **Half-life ($t_{1/2}$)**: The half-life is defined as the time required for the concentration of the xenobiotic to decrease to half of its initial value. We can derive its relationship with $k$ by setting $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C_0$.\n    $$ \\frac{1}{2} C_0 = C_0 \\exp(-k t_{1/2}) $$\n    $$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2}) $$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2} $$\n    $$ -\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2} $$\n    $$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k} $$\n    This shows that for a first-order process, the half-life is constant and independent of the concentration.\n\n3.  **Clearance (CL)**: Clearance is a measure of the efficiency of xenobiotic elimination from the body. It is defined as the volume of a physiological fluid (e.g., plasma) from which the substance is completely removed per unit of time. It relates the rate of elimination to the concentration $C(t)$:\n    $$ \\text{Rate of Elimination} = \\text{CL} \\cdot C(t) $$\n    The units of clearance are volume per time (e.g., $\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$).\n\nTo relate clearance (CL) to $k$ and $V$, we equate the two expressions for the rate of elimination:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Elimination} = k \\cdot A(t) = k \\cdot (C(t) \\cdot V) $$\n$$ \\text{Rate of Elimination} = \\text{CL} \\cdot C(t) $$\nTherefore:\n$$ \\text{CL} \\cdot C(t) = k \\cdot V \\cdot C(t) $$\nFor any non-zero concentration $C(t)$, we can divide by $C(t)$ to obtain the fundamental relationship:\n$$ \\mathrm{CL} = k \\cdot V $$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Half-life**\n\nWe are given the following values for a specific xenobiotic:\n- Volume of distribution, $V = 30\\ \\mathrm{L}$\n- Clearance, $\\mathrm{CL} = 3.0\\ \\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n\nWe need to compute the half-life, $t_{1/2}$.
