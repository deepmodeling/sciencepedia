The clinical objective is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), defined as the highest dose level at which the observed dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate satisfies the rule that at most $1$ DLT is seen among $6$ patients at that dose, and where the next higher dose exhibits at least $2$ DLTs among either $3$ or $6$ patients. Cohorts of size $3$ are treated sequentially starting at dose level $1$ and escalating one level at a time, unless dose reductions or cohort expansions are mandated by observed DLTs. The standard \"3+3\" rules are as follows: if $0$ DLTs are observed among $3$ patients at a dose, escalate to the next higher dose; if $1$ DLT is observed among $3$ patients, expand that dose to $6$ patients; if $\\ge 2$ DLTs are observed among $3$ patients, de-escalate to the previous dose and stop.

The primary endpoint is a binary composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke, where the event is considered undesirable. The trial prespecifies an absolute noninferiority margin on the risk difference scale of $\\Delta = 0.03$, defined so that noninferiority is concluded if the two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval for the risk difference $\\theta = p_{T} - p_{C}$ lies entirely below $\\Delta$, where $p_{T}$ and $p_{C}$ denote the true event probabilities in the test and control arms, respectively.\n\nIn the modified intention-to-treat analysis, the test arm has $n_{T} = 1200$ participants with $x_{T} = 90$ events, and the control arm has $n_{C} = 1180$ participants with $x_{C} = 70$ events. Assume independent binomial sampling across arms and use the large-sample normal approximation justified by the Central Limit Theorem to construct a two-sided $95\\%$ Wald confidence interval for $\\theta$.\n\nCompute the upper limit of this two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval for $\\theta$ as a decimal proportion. Round your final answer to four significant figures. Express the answer without units. For clarity, noninferiority at one-sided significance level $\\alpha = 0.025$ would be declared if and only if this upper limit is strictly less than $\\Delta$, but you must report only the numerical upper limit.", "solution": "The objective is to compute the upper limit of a two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval for the risk difference $\\theta = p_{T} - p_{C}$. The analysis will use the Wald method based on the normal approximation.\n\nFirst, we calculate the point estimates for the event probabilities in the test ($p_T$) and control ($p_C$) arms. The sample proportions are the maximum likelihood estimators for the binomial probabilities:\n$$ \\hat{p}_{T} = \\frac{x_{T}}{n_{T}} = \\frac{90}{1200} = 0.075 $$\n$$ \\hat{p}_{C} = \\frac{x_{C}}{n_{C}} = \\frac{70}{1180} \\approx 0.059322 $$\n\nThe point estimate for the risk difference, $\\theta$, is:\n$$ \\hat{\\theta} = \\hat{p}_{T} - \\hat{p}_{C} = 0.075 - \\frac{70}{1180} = \\frac{3}{40} - \\frac{7}{118} = \\frac{3 \\times 118 - 7 \\times 40}{40 \\times 118} = \\frac{354 - 280}{4720} = \\frac{74}{4720} = \\frac{37}{2360} \\approx 0.015678 $$\n\nA two-sided $(1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%$ Wald confidence interval for $\\theta$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\hat{\\theta} \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\theta}) $$\nwhere $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\theta})$ is the standard error of the estimated risk difference and $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the corresponding quantile of the standard normal distribution. For a $95\\%$ confidence interval, $\\alpha = 0.05$, so we require the $z_{1-0.05/2} = z_{0.975}$ quantile. The standard value for $z_{0.975}$ is approximately $1.96$.\n\nThe standard error for the difference between two independent proportions, using the Wald method, is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}_{T}(1-\\hat{p}_{T})}{n_{T}} + \\frac{\\hat{p}_{C}(1-\\hat{p}_{C})}{n_{C}}} $$\n\nWe substitute the sample values into this formula:\n$$ \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.075(1 - 0.075)}{1200} + \\frac{(\\frac{70}{1180})(1 - \\frac{70}{1180})}{1180}} $$\n$$ \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.075 \\times 0.925}{1200} + \\frac{(\\frac{70}{1180})(\\frac{1110}{1180})}{1180}} $$\n$$ \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.069375}{1200} + \\frac{77700}{1180^3}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.0000578125 + 0.0000472901} $$\n$$ \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\theta}) \\approx \\sqrt{0.0001051026} \\approx 0.010252 $$\n\nThe upper limit (UL) of the two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval is:\n$$ \\text{UL} = \\hat{\\theta} + z_{0.975} \\times \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\theta}) $$\nSubstituting the computed values:\n$$ \\text{UL} \\approx 0.015678 + 1.96 \\times 0.010252 $$\n$$ \\text{UL} \\approx 0.015678 + 0.02009392 $$\n$$ \\text{UL} \\approx 0.03577192 $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures. The first four significant figures of $0.03577192$ are $3, 5, 7, 7$. The fifth significant figure is $1$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the fourth significant figure).\n$$ \\text{UL} \\approx 0.03577 $$\nThis is the upper limit of the two-sided $95\\%$ Wald confidence interval for the risk difference.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.03577}\n$$", "id": "4575795"}]}
