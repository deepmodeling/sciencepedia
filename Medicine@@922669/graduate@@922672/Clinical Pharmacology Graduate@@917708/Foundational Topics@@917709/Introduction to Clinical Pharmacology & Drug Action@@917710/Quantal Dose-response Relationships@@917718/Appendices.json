The number of responses $y_i$ out of $n_i$ subjects follows a binomial distribution $Y_i \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n_i, p_i)$, where $p_i = p(d_i)$ is the probability of response at that dose. The probability mass function for a single dose group is:\n$$ L_i(\\alpha, \\beta | y_i, n_i, d_i) = \\binom{n_i}{y_i} p_i^{y_i} (1 - p_i)^{n_i - y_i} $$\nwhere $p_i = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\alpha - \\beta \\ln d_i)}$.\n\nAssuming the outcomes for the three independent dose groups are independent, the total likelihood function $L(\\alpha, \\beta)$ is the product of the individual likelihoods:\n$$ L(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^{3} L_i = \\prod_{i=1}^{3} \\binom{n_i}{y_i} p_i^{y_i} (1 - p_i)^{n_i - y_i} $$\n\nFor maximum likelihood estimation, it is more convenient to work with the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\ln L(\\alpha, \\beta)$:\n$$ \\ell(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left[ \\ln\\binom{n_i}{y_i} + y_i \\ln(p_i) + (n_i - y_i) \\ln(1 - p_i) \\right] $$\nTo find the parameters $\\hat{\\alpha}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$ that maximize this function, we can ignore the constant term $\\sum \\ln\\binom{n_i}{y_i}$. Let $\\eta_i = \\alpha + \\beta \\ln d_i$. The logistic function can be written as $p_i = \\frac{\\exp(\\eta_i)}{1 + \\exp(\\eta_i)}$, and $1 - p_i = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(\\eta_i)}$.\nSubstituting these into the log-likelihood (ignoring constants) gives:\n$$ \\ell(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left[ y_i \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\exp(\\eta_i)}{1 + \\exp(\\eta_i)}\\right) + (n_i - y_i) \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(\\eta_i)}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\ell(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left[ y_i (\\eta_i - \\ln(1 + \\exp(\\eta_i))) - (n_i - y_i) \\ln(1 + \\exp(\\eta_i)) \\right] $$\n$$ \\ell(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left[ y_i \\eta_i - n_i \\ln(1 + \\exp(\\eta_i)) \\right] $$\n$$ \\ell(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left[ y_i (\\alpha + \\beta \\ln d_i) - n_i \\ln(1 + \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta \\ln d_i)) \\right] $$\n\nThe score equations are found by setting the partial derivatives of the log-likelihood with respect to $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ to zero.\nThe derivative of the second term with respect to $\\alpha$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha} \\left[ n_i \\ln(1 + \\exp(\\eta_i)) \\right] = n_i \\frac{\\exp(\\eta_i)}{1 + \\exp(\\eta_i)} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\eta_i}{\\partial \\alpha} = n_i p_i \\cdot 1 = n_i p_i $$\nThe derivative with respect to $\\beta$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\left[ n_i \\ln(1 + \\exp(\\eta_i)) \\right] = n_i \\frac{\\exp(\\eta_i)}{1 + \\exp(\\eta_i)} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\eta_i}{\\partial \\beta} = n_i p_i \\cdot \\ln d_i $$\n\nThe score equations, $U_{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\partial \\ell}{\\partial \\alpha} = 0$ and $U_{\\beta} = \\frac{\\partial \\ell}{\\partial \\beta} = 0$, are:\n$$ U_{\\alpha} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( y_i - n_i p_i \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ U_{\\beta} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( y_i \\ln d_i - n_i p_i \\ln d_i \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (y_i - n_i p_i) \\ln d_i = 0 $$\nThese equations are non-linear in $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ and are typically solved numerically. However, the provided data exhibits a special structure. The observed proportions of response are:\n$p_{\\text{obs},1} = y_1/n_1 = 10/50 = 0.2$\n$p_{\\text{obs},2} = y_2/n_2 = 25/50 = 0.5$\n$p_{\\text{obs},3} = y_3/n_3 = 40/50 = 0.8$\n\nThe model is $\\text{logit}(p(d)) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p(d)}{1-p(d)}\\right) = \\alpha + \\beta \\ln d$.\nLet's see if there exist parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ for which the fitted probabilities $\\hat{p}_i$ exactly match the observed proportions $p_{\\text{obs},i}$. This requires the logit of the observed proportions to be a linear function of the log-dose.\n$$ \\text{logit}(p_{\\text{obs},1}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.2}{1-0.2}\\right) = \\ln(0.25) = -\\ln(4) $$\n$$ \\text{logit}(p_{\\text{obs},2}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.5}{1-0.5}\\right) = \\ln(1) = 0 $$\n$$ \\text{logit}(p_{\\text{obs},3}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.8}{1-0.8}\\right) = \\ln(4) $$\nWe have a system of linear equations for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n1. $\\alpha + \\beta \\ln(15) = -\\ln(4)$\n2. $\\alpha + \\beta \\ln(30) = 0$\n3. $\\alpha + \\beta \\ln(60) = \\ln(4)$\n\nFrom equation (2), we find a relationship between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n$$ \\alpha = -\\beta \\ln(30) $$\nSubstitute this into equation (1):\n$$ -\\beta \\ln(30) + \\beta \\ln(15) = -\\ln(4) $$\n$$ \\beta (\\ln(15) - \\ln(30)) = -\\ln(4) $$\n$$ \\beta \\ln\\left(\\frac{15}{30}\\right) = -\\ln(4) $$\n$$ \\beta \\ln(0.5) = -\\ln(4) $$\n$$ -\\beta \\ln(2) = -2\\ln(2) $$\n$$ \\hat{\\beta} = 2 $$\nNow we find the estimate for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\hat{\\alpha} = -2 \\ln(30) $$\nWe must verify that these estimates satisfy equation (3):\n$$ \\hat{\\alpha} + \\hat{\\beta} \\ln(60) = -2\\ln(30) + 2\\ln(60) = 2(\\ln(60) - \\ln(30)) = 2\\ln\\left(\\frac{60}{30}\\right) = 2\\ln(2) = \\ln(4) $$\nThe equation is satisfied. The data lie perfectly on a line in the logit-log-dose space. In this special case, the MLEs are the parameters of this line. The maximum likelihood estimates are $\\hat{\\alpha} = -2\\ln(30)$ and $\\hat{\\beta} = 2$.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the ED$_{50}$. By definition, this is the dose $d$ at which the probability of response is $0.5$:\n$$ p(\\text{ED}_{50}) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\alpha - \\beta \\ln(\\text{ED}_{50}))} = 0.5 $$\n$$ 1 + \\exp(-\\alpha - \\beta \\ln(\\text{ED}_{50})) = 2 $$\n$$ \\exp(-\\alpha - \\beta \\ln(\\text{ED}_{50})) = 1 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\alpha - \\beta \\ln(\\text{ED}_{50}) = 0 $$\n$$ \\beta \\ln(\\text{ED}_{50}) = -\\alpha $$\n$$ \\ln(\\text{ED}_{50}) = -\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta} $$\n$$ \\text{ED}_{50} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right) $$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of the ED$_{50}$ using the estimated parameters $\\hat{\\alpha}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$:\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{ED}}_{50} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{\\hat{\\beta}}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{-2\\ln(30)}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{ED}}_{50} = \\exp\\left(\\ln(30)\\right) $$\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{ED}}_{50} = 30 $$\nThe estimated median effective dose is $30$ mg.

We rearrange the model equation to solve for $D$:\n$$ \\beta \\ln(D) = \\Phi^{-1}(p) - \\alpha $$\n$$ \\ln(D) = \\frac{\\Phi^{-1}(p) - \\alpha}{\\beta} $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the dose $D$ as a function of the probability $p$:\n$$ D(p) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Phi^{-1}(p) - \\alpha}{\\beta}\\right) $$\nThis is the general expression for the dose required to produce a response in a proportion $p$ of the population.\n\nNext, we specialize this expression to find the $ED_{50}$. By definition, $ED_{50}$ is the dose $D$ where $p = 0.5$. For the standard normal distribution, the median ($50^{th}$ percentile) is at $z=0$. Therefore, the value of the quantile function at $p=0.5$ is $\\Phi^{-1}(0.5) = 0$. Substituting this into our general dose expression yields:\n$$ ED_{50} = D(0.5) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Phi^{-1}(0.5) - \\alpha}{\\beta}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{0 - \\alpha}{\\beta}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right) $$\n\nNow, we determine the interquartile range (IQR). The IQR is the difference between the dose for $p=0.75$ ($D_{0.75}$) and the dose for $p=0.25$ ($D_{0.25}$).
