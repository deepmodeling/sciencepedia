It provides a standard, solvable scenario in pharmacology. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation\n\nLet $[A]$ be the concentration of the agonist, $[R]_{\\text{total}}$ be the total concentration of receptors, and $[AR]$ be the concentration of the agonist-receptor complex. The binding reaction is $A+R \\rightleftharpoons AR$.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the dissociation constant, $K_D$, is given by:\n$$K_D = \\frac{[A][R]}{[AR]}$$\nwhere $[R] = [R]_{\\text{total}} - [AR]$ is the concentration of free receptors. Substituting for $[R]$:\n$$K_D = \\frac{[A]([R]_{\\text{total}} - [AR])}{[AR]}$$\nSolving for $[AR]$, the concentration of occupied receptors, yields:\n$$K_D [AR] = [A][R]_{\\text{total}} - [A][AR]$$\n$$[AR](K_D + [A]) = [A][R]_{\\text{total}}$$\n$$[AR] = \\frac{[A][R]_{\\text{total}}}{K_D + [A]}$$\nThe problem states that the effect, $E$, is proportional to the number (or concentration) of agonist-occupied receptors. So, $E = c \\cdot [AR]$, where $c$ is a constant of proportionality.\n$$E = c \\cdot \\frac{[A][R]_{\\text{total}}}{K_D + [A]}$$\n\n**State 1: Before the Antagonist**\n\nLet the initial total receptor concentration be $[R]_{\\text{total},1}$. The effect is:\n$$E_1 = \\frac{c [R]_{\\text{total},1} [A]}{K_D + [A]}$$\nThe maximal effect, $E_{\\max,1}$, is achieved when receptor occupancy is full ($[AR] \\to [R]_{\\text{total},1}$), which occurs as $[A] \\to \\infty$.\n$$E_{\\max,1} = c \\cdot [R]_{\\text{total},1}$$\nThus, we can write the effect equation as:\n$$E_1 = \\frac{E_{\\max,1} [A]}{K_D + [A]}$$\nThe half-maximal effective concentration, $\\text{EC}_{50,1}$, is the agonist concentration $[A]$ where $E_1 = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\max,1}$.\n$$\\frac{1}{2} E_{\\max,1} = \\frac{E_{\\max,1} [\\text{EC}_{50,1}]}{K_D + [\\text{EC}_{50,1}]}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{[\\text{EC}_{50,1}]}{K_D + [\\text{EC}_{50,1}]}$$\n$$K_D + [\\text{EC}_{50,1}] = 2[\\text{EC}_{50,1}]$$\n$$\\text{EC}_{50,1} = K_D$$\nThis result is a direct consequence of the problem's specific conditions: \"no receptor reserve\" and \"effect is proportional to the number of agonist-occupied receptors\". In such a system, the concentration for half-maximal effect ($\\text{EC}_{50}$) is identical to the concentration for half-maximal binding ($K_D$).\n\n**State 2: After the Irreversible Antagonist**\n\nThe irreversible antagonist reduces the number of functional receptors by $50\\%$. The new total receptor concentration, $[R]_{\\text{total},2}$, is:\n$$[R]_{\\text{total},2} = (1 - 0.50) [R]_{\\text{total},1} = 0.50 [R]_{\\text{total},1}$$\nThe problem states that the binding affinity of the agonist for the remaining receptors is unaltered, so $K_D$ remains the same.\nThe new maximal effect, $E_{\\max,2}$, is achieved when all *remaining* receptors are occupied.\n$$E_{\\max,2} = c \\cdot [R]_{\\text{total},2} = c \\cdot (0.50 [R]_{\\text{total},1}) = 0.50 \\cdot (c [R]_{\\text{total},1})$$\nSince $E_{\\max,1} = c [R]_{\\text{total},1}$, we have:\n$$E_{\\max,2} = 0.50 E_{\\max,1}$$\nThis shows that the maximal effect decreases by $50\\%$.\n\nNow we determine the new half-maximal effective concentration, $\\text{EC}_{50,2}$. This is the agonist concentration where the new effect, $E_2$, equals half of the *new* maximal effect, $\\frac{1}{2} E_{\\max,2}$.\nThe new effect equation is:\n$$E_2 = \\frac{c [R]_{\\text{total},2} [A]}{K_D + [A]} = \\frac{E_{\\max,2} [A]}{K_D + [A]}$$\nSetting $E_2 = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\max,2}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} E_{\\max,2} = \\frac{E_{\\max,2} [\\text{EC}_{50,2}]}{K_D + [\\text{EC}_{50,2}]}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{[\\text{EC}_{50,2}]}{K_D + [\\text{EC}_{50,2}]}$$\n$$K_D + [\\text{EC}_{50,2}] = 2[\\text{EC}_{50,2}]$$\n$$\\text{EC}_{50,2} = K_D$$\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**\n- Change in $E_{\\max}$: $E_{\\max,2} = 0.50 E_{\\max,1}$. The maximal effect is reduced by $50\\%$.\n- Change in $\\text{EC}_{50}$: $\\text{EC}_{50,2} = K_D$ and $\\text{EC}_{50,1} = K_D$. Therefore, $\\text{EC}_{50,2} = \\text{EC}_{50,1}$. The half-maximal effective concentration remains unchanged.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $E_{\\max}$ decreases by $50\\%$; $EC_{50}$ remains unchanged.**\nAs derived above, an irreversible antagonist that removes $50\\%$ of the receptors in a system with no receptor reserve will reduce the maximal possible effect by $50\\%$. The $\\text{EC}_{50}$ in such a system is equal to the agonist's binding affinity ($K_D$), which is stated to be unchanged. This option is fully consistent with the derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. $E_{\\max}$ decreases by $50\\%$; $EC_{50}$ increases.**\nThe first part is correct. However, $\\text{EC}_{50}$ would only increase in the presence of a *competitive* antagonist, which competes for the same binding site and thus requires a higher agonist concentration to achieve the same level of fractional occupancy. For an irreversible antagonist in this specific system, $\\text{EC}_{50}$ is unchanged.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. $E_{\\max}$ remains unchanged; $EC_{50}$ increases.**\n$E_{\\max}$ cannot remain unchanged. The problem explicitly states there is \"no receptor reserve,\" meaning all receptors are required to produce the maximal effect. Halving the number of receptors must therefore halve the maximal effect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. $E_{\\max}$ decreases by $50\\%$; $EC_{50}$ decreases.**\nThe first part is correct. A decrease in $\\text{EC}_{50}$ would imply an increase in the agonist's potency. The antagonist's action as described does not enhance the agonist's binding or efficacy at the remaining receptors.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Both $E_{\\max}$ and $EC_{50}$ remain unchanged.**\nAs established, $E_{\\max}$ must decrease because the number of functional effect-generating units (the receptors) has been reduced by half.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4521478"}, {"introduction": "Modern receptor theory posits that some receptors can be active even without an agonist, a phenomenon termed constitutive activity.
