A solution can be derived from first principles.\n\n**Solution Derivation:**\nThe problem states that the pharmacodynamic and toxicodynamic responses follow a monotonic saturable one-site binding model with a Hill coefficient of $1$. This corresponds to the simple Emax model, which is mathematically equivalent to the Michaelis-Menten equation.\n\nThe equation for the efficacy response, $E$, as a function of the drug concentration, $C$, is:\n$$E(C) = \\frac{E_{max} \\cdot C}{EC_{50} + C}$$\nSimilarly, the equation for the toxicity response, $T$, as a function of the drug concentration, $C$, is:\n$$T(C) = \\frac{T_{max} \\cdot C}{TC_{50} + C}$$\n\nThe provided parameters are: $E_{max} = 100$, $EC_{50} = 2$ mg/L, $T_{max} = 100$, and $TC_{50} = 8$ mg/L.\n\nFirst, we determine the minimal effective concentration, $C_{eff}$. This is defined as the smallest concentration for which the efficacy $E$ is greater than or equal to $50$. Since the function $E(C)$ is monotonically increasing with $C$, this is the concentration at which $E(C)$ is exactly equal to $50$.\n$$50 = \\frac{100 \\cdot C_{eff}}{2 + C_{eff}}$$\nOne can immediately recognize that an effect of $50$ is exactly half of the maximal effect $E_{max} = 100$. By definition, the concentration that produces a half-maximal effect is the $EC_{50}$. Therefore, $C_{eff}$ must be equal to $EC_{50}$. We can verify this algebraically:\n$$50 \\cdot (2 + C_{eff}) = 100 \\cdot C_{eff}$$\n$$100 + 50 \\cdot C_{eff} = 100 \\cdot C_{eff}$$\n$$100 = (100 - 50) \\cdot C_{eff}$$\n$$100 = 50 \\cdot C_{eff}$$\n$$C_{eff} = \\frac{100}{50} = 2$$\nSo, the minimal effective concentration is $C_{eff} = 2$ mg/L.\n\nNext, we determine the maximal non-toxic concentration, $C_{tox}$. This is defined as the largest concentration for which the toxicity $T$ is less than $30$. Since the function $T(C)$ is also monotonically increasing with $C$, the boundary of this condition is the concentration at which $T(C)$ is exactly equal to $30$.\n$$30 = \\frac{100 \\cdot C_{tox}}{8 + C_{tox}}$$\nWe solve this equation for $C_{tox}$:\n$$30 \\cdot (8 + C_{tox}) = 100 \\cdot C_{tox}$$\n$$240 + 30 \\cdot C_{tox} = 100 \\cdot C_{tox}$$\n$$240 = (100 - 30) \\cdot C_{tox}$$\n$$240 = 70 \\cdot C_{tox}$$\n$$C_{tox} = \\frac{240}{70} = \\frac{24}{7}$$\nSo, the maximal non-toxic concentration is $C_{tox} = \\frac{24}{7}$ mg/L.\n\nFinally, we calculate the therapeutic window width, which is defined as the difference $C_{tox} - C_{eff}$.\n$$\\text{Width} = C_{tox} - C_{eff} = \\frac{24}{7} - 2$$\nTo perform the subtraction, we use a common denominator:\n$$\\text{Width} = \\frac{24}{7} - \\frac{14}{7} = \\frac{24 - 14}{7} = \\frac{10}{7}$$\nThe problem requests the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. We convert the fraction to its decimal representation:\n$$\\frac{10}{7} \\approx 1.4285714...$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures yields $1.429$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.429}$$", "id": "4994606"}, {"introduction": "Once the therapeutic window is defined, the challenge shifts to maintaining the patient's steady-state drug concentration within that range.
