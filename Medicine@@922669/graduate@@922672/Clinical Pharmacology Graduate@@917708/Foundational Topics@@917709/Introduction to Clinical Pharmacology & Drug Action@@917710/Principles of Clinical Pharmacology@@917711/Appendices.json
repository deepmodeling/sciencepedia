The standard mathematical model for this phenomenon is the Hill-Langmuir equation, commonly referred to as the Hill equation. This equation relates the magnitude of the physiological effect, $E$, to the concentration of the drug, $C$. The general form of the Hill equation is:\n\n$$ E(C) = \\frac{E_{max} \\cdot C^n}{EC_{50}^n + C^n} $$\n\nHere, $E_{max}$ is the maximal possible effect, $EC_{50}$ is the concentration of the drug that produces $50\\%$ of the maximal effect, and $n$ is the Hill coefficient, which quantifies the degree of cooperativity in the binding process. The given values are $E_{max} = 40$ units, $EC_{50} = 2 \\text{ mg L}^{-1}$, and $n=3$.\n\nOur objective is to find the concentration $C_{90}$, which is defined as the concentration that elicits an effect equal to $90\\%$ of the maximal effect. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n\n$$ E(C_{90}) = 0.90 \\cdot E_{max} $$\n\nTo determine $C_{90}$, we substitute this condition into the Hill equation:\n\n$$ 0.90 \\cdot E_{max} = \\frac{E_{max} \\cdot C_{90}^n}{EC_{50}^n + C_{90}^n} $$\n\nSince $E_{max}$ represents a maximal effect, it is non-zero, allowing us to divide both sides of the equation by $E_{max}$:\n\n$$ 0.90 = \\frac{C_{90}^n}{EC_{50}^n + C_{90}^n} $$\n\nWe must now solve this equation for $C_{90}$ in terms of $EC_{50}$ and $n$. We can rearrange the equation by multiplying both sides by the denominator:\n\n$$ 0.90 \\cdot (EC_{50}^n + C_{90}^n) = C_{90}^n $$\n\nDistributing the $0.90$ term on the left side gives:\n\n$$ 0.90 \\cdot EC_{50}^n + 0.90 \\cdot C_{90}^n = C_{90}^n $$\n\nTo isolate the term containing $C_{90}$, we gather all terms with $C_{90}^n$ on one side of the equation:\n\n$$ 0.90 \\cdot EC_{50}^n = C_{90}^n - 0.90 \\cdot C_{90}^n $$\n\nFactoring out $C_{90}^n$ on the right side yields:\n\n$$ 0.90 \\cdot EC_{50}^n = (1 - 0.90) \\cdot C_{90}^n $$\n$$ 0.90 \\cdot EC_{50}^n = 0.10 \\cdot C_{90}^n $$\n\nWe are interested in the ratio $C_{90}/EC_{50}$. To find this, we first rearrange the equation to form the ratio of the concentrations raised to the power of $n$:\n\n$$ \\frac{C_{90}^n}{EC_{50}^n} = \\frac{0.90}{0.10} $$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$$ \\left(\\frac{C_{90}}{EC_{50}}\\right)^n = 9 $$\n\nTo solve for the ratio $C_{90}/EC_{50}$, we take the $n$-th root of both sides of the equation:\n\n$$ \\frac{C_{90}}{EC_{50}} = \\sqrt[n]{9} = 9^{1/n} $$\n\nThis is the general symbolic expression for the ratio.

A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem requires a derivation from first principles, followed by a calculation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Relationships**\n\nWe begin from the core definitions of first-order elimination, volume of distribution, and clearance.\n\n1.  **First-Order Elimination:** The rate of elimination of a drug from the body is directly proportional to the amount of drug, $A$, present in the body. The constant of proportionality is the first-order elimination rate constant, $k$. Mathematically, this is expressed as a differential equation:\n    $$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = -k_e \\cdot A $$\n    Here, we use $k$ for the elimination rate constant as per the problem's notation. The magnitude of the elimination rate is therefore $k \\cdot A$.\n\n2.  **Volume of Distribution ($V_d$):** The apparent volume of distribution, $V_d$, is a proportionality constant that relates the concentration of the drug in plasma, $C$, to the total amount of drug in the body, $A$.\n    $$ C = \\frac{A}{V_d} \\quad \\implies \\quad A = C \\cdot V_d $$\n\n3.  **Clearance ($CL$):** Total body clearance, $CL$, is defined as the volume of plasma from which the drug is completely removed per unit of time. It relates the rate of drug elimination to the plasma concentration, $C$.\n    $$ \\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL \\cdot C $$\n\n4.  **Connecting the Principles:** By equating the two expressions for the rate of elimination, we can establish the relationship between $k$, $CL$, and $V_d$.\n    $$ k \\cdot A = CL \\cdot C $$\n    Now, substitute the expression for $A$ from the definition of $V_d$ into this equation:\n    $$ k \\cdot (C \\cdot V_d) = CL \\cdot C $$\n    Assuming the drug concentration $C$ is non-zero, we can divide both sides by $C$ to find the relationship for $k$:\n    $$ k \\cdot V_d = CL $$\n    $$ k = \\frac{CL}{V_d} $$\n    This equation formally demonstrates how the elimination rate constant $k$ is altered by changes in $CL$ and $V_d$. Specifically, $k$ is directly proportional to clearance and inversely proportional to the volume of distribution.\n\n5.  **Deriving the Half-Life ($t_{1/2}$):** The elimination half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is the time required for the drug amount or concentration to decrease by $50\\%$. We can derive its formula by solving the first-order elimination differential equation, $\\frac{dA}{dt} = -k \\cdot A$. Separating variables and integrating from time $t=0$ (with initial amount $A_0$) to time $t$:\n    $$ \\int_{A_0}^{A(t)} \\frac{1}{A} dA = \\int_0^t -k \\, dt $$\n    $$ \\ln(A(t)) - \\ln(A_0) = -k \\cdot t $$\n    $$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{A(t)}{A_0}\\right) = -k \\cdot t $$\n    By definition, at $t = t_{1/2}$, the amount of drug is half the initial amount, so $A(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{A_0}{2}$. Substituting this into the equation:\n    $$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{A_0/2}{A_0}\\right) = -k \\cdot t_{1/2} $$\n    $$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k \\cdot t_{1/2} $$\n    $$ -\\ln(2) = -k \\cdot t_{1/2} $$\n    Solving for $t_{1/2}$:\n    $$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k} $$\n    This demonstrates that the half-life is inversely proportional to the elimination rate constant.\n\n6.  **Final Relationship for $t_{1/2}$:** To show how $t_{1/2}$ is altered by $CL$ and $V_d$, we substitute the expression for $k$ ($k = CL/V_d$) into the equation for $t_{1/2}$:\n    $$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{CL/V_d} $$\n    $$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2) \\cdot V_d}{CL} $$\n    This is the final derived relationship, showing that the elimination half-life is directly proportional to the volume of distribution and inversely proportional to clearance. This completes the first part of the task.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the New Half-Life**\n\nWe now use the derived formula to compute the new half-life ($t_{1/2, new}$) with the patient's updated parameters.\n\n1.  **Baseline Parameters:**\n    -   $CL_{base} = 10 \\, \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}}$\n    -   $V_{d,base} = 80 \\, \\mathrm{L}$\n\n2.  **Calculate New Parameters:**\n    -   The new clearance, $CL_{new}$, is reduced by $30\\%$ ($0.30$).\n        $$ CL_{new} = CL_{base} \\cdot (1 - 0.30) = 10 \\, \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}} \\cdot 0.70 = 7.0 \\, \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}} $$\n    -   The new volume of distribution, $V_{d,new}$, is increased by $40\\%$ ($0.40$).\n        $$ V_{d,new} = V_{d,base} \\cdot (1 + 0.40) = 80 \\, \\mathrm{L} \\cdot 1.40 = 112 \\, \\mathrm{L} $$\n\n3.  **Compute the New Half-Life:**\n    Using the derived formula with the new parameters:\n    $$ t_{1/2, new} = \\frac{\\ln(2) \\cdot V_{d,new}}{CL_{new}} $$\n    Substitute the numerical values:\n    $$ t_{1/2, new} = \\frac{\\ln(2) \\cdot 112 \\, \\mathrm{L}}{7.0 \\, \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}}} $$\n    The dimensional analysis yields units of hours, as expected: $\\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{h}} = \\mathrm{h}$.\n    $$ t_{1/2, new} = \\frac{112}{7.0} \\cdot \\ln(2) \\, \\mathrm{h} $$\n    $$ t_{1/2, new} = 16 \\cdot \\ln(2) \\, \\mathrm{h} $$\n    Now, we calculate the numerical value.\n    $$ t_{1/2, new} \\approx 16 \\cdot 0.69314718... \\, \\mathrm{h} $$\n    $$ t_{1/2, new} \\approx 11.0903549... \\, \\mathrm{h} $$\n\n4.  **Rounding:**\n    The problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n    $$ t_{1/2, new} \\approx 11.09 \\, \\mathrm{h} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11.09}$$", "id": "4583848"}, {"introduction": "A drug's journey from oral administration to the systemic circulation can be limited by first-pass metabolism in the gut wall and liver, which reduces its overall bioavailability.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds in a stepwise manner to compute the required quantities based on first principles.\n\n**1. Absolute Oral Bioavailability ($F$)**\n\nAbsolute oral bioavailability, $F$, is the fraction of an orally administered dose that reaches the systemic circulation unchanged. It is calculated by comparing the dose-normalized area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for oral administration to that for intravenous (IV) administration. The IV dose is, by definition, $100\\%$ bioavailable.\n\nThe formula for $F$ is:\n$$F = \\frac{\\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{po}}}{D_{\\mathrm{po}}}}{\\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{iv}}}{D_{\\mathrm{iv}}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$F = \\frac{\\frac{20 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h \\cdot L^{-1}}}{200 \\ \\mathrm{mg}}}{\\frac{50 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h \\cdot L^{-1}}}{100 \\ \\mathrm{mg}}} = \\frac{0.1 \\ \\mathrm{h \\cdot L^{-1}}}{0.5 \\ \\mathrm{h \\cdot L^{-1}}} = 0.2$$\nThe absolute oral bioavailability is $0.2$.\n\n**2. Hepatic Extraction Ratio ($E_h$)**\n\nTo determine the individual contributions of intestinal and hepatic metabolism to the low bioavailability, we must first determine the hepatic extraction ratio, $E_h$. This requires calculating the systemic and hepatic clearances.\n\nTotal systemic clearance, $\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{sys}}$, is determined from the IV data. Since concentrations are measured in plasma, this is the systemic plasma clearance, $\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{sys,p}}$.\n$$\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{sys,p}} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{iv}}}{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{iv}}} = \\frac{100 \\ \\mathrm{mg}}{50 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h \\cdot L^{-1}}} = 2 \\ \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}}$$\nSystemic clearance is the sum of clearances by all eliminating organs. Here, it is composed of renal clearance ($\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{R}}$) and hepatic clearance ($\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{H}}$).\n$$\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{sys,p}} = \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{R,p}} + \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{H,p}}$$\nGiven the renal clearance fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{R}} = 0.30$, hepatic plasma clearance is:\n$$\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{H,p}} = \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{sys,p}} \\times (1 - f_{\\mathrm{R}}) = (2 \\ \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}}) \\times (1 - 0.30) = 1.4 \\ \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}}$$\nThe problem specifies that hepatic extraction is defined on whole blood. Therefore, we must convert the hepatic plasma clearance to hepatic blood clearance, $\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{H,b}}$, using the blood-to-plasma ratio, $R_b$. The relationship is derived from the fact that the rate of elimination by the liver is the same regardless of the reference fluid (blood or plasma): $\\mathrm{rate} = \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{H,p}} C_p = \\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{H,b}} C_b$. With $R_b = C_b / C_p$, we have:\n$$\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{H,b}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{H,p}}}{R_b} = \\frac{1.4 \\ \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}}}{0.80} = 1.75 \\ \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}}$$\nUsing the well-stirred model, hepatic blood clearance is related to hepatic blood flow ($Q_h$) and the hepatic extraction ratio ($E_h$):\n$$\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{H,b}} = Q_h \\times E_h$$\nWe can now solve for $E_h$:\n$$E_h = \\frac{\\mathrm{CL}_{\\mathrm{H,b}}}{Q_h} = \\frac{1.75 \\ \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}}}{90 \\ \\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}}} = \\frac{1.75}{90}$$\nThis gives $E_h \\approx 0.019444...$.\n\n**3.
