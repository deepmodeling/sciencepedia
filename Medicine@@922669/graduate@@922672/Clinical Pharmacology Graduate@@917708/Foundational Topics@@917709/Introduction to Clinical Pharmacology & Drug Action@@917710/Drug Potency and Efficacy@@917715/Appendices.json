A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem describes a drug-receptor interaction that follows a rectangular hyperbola. This corresponds to the Hill-Langmuir equation for a single, non-cooperative binding site. The relationship between the observed effect $E$ and the agonist concentration $[L]$ is given by:\n$$E = \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot [L]}{EC_{50} + [L]}$$\nwhere $E_{\\max}$ is the maximum possible effect, and $EC_{50}$ is the concentration of the agonist that produces $50\\%$ of the maximum effect.\n\n**1. Fold Difference in Potency**\n\nPotency refers to the concentration of a drug required to produce a certain level of effect. It is inversely related to the $EC_{50}$; a lower $EC_{50}$ indicates a higher potency. The fold difference by which drug $A$ is more potent than drug $B$ is the ratio of their potencies. This can be expressed as the inverse ratio of their $EC_{50}$ values:\n$$\\text{Fold difference in potency} = \\frac{\\text{Potency of } A}{\\text{Potency of } B} = \\frac{EC_{50, B}}{EC_{50, A}}$$\n\nFirst, we must calculate the $EC_{50}$ values for each drug from their given $pEC_{50}$ values. The definition provided is $pEC_{50} = -\\log_{10}(EC_{50})$, where $EC_{50}$ is in molar units ($M$). Rearranging this equation gives:\n$$EC_{50} = 10^{-pEC_{50}}$$\n\nFor drug $A$, with $pEC_{50,A} = 8.0$:\n$$EC_{50,A} = 10^{-8.0} \\, M$$\n\nFor drug $B$, with $pEC_{50,B} = 7.0$:\n$$EC_{50,B} = 10^{-7.0} \\, M$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the fold difference in potency:\n$$\\text{Fold difference} = \\frac{EC_{50, B}}{EC_{50, A}} = \\frac{10^{-7.0} \\, M}{10^{-8.0} \\, M} = 10^{(-7.0) - (-8.0)} = 10^{1} = 10$$\nThus, drug $A$ is $10$ times more potent than drug $B$.\n\n**2. Concentration of Drug $B$ for Equipotent Effect**\n\nWe are asked to find the concentration of drug $B$, denoted $[B]$, that produces the same effect as drug $A$ at a concentration of $[A] = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. We are given that both drugs are full agonists and have an identical $E_{\\max}$.\nLet $E_A$ be the effect of drug $A$ and $E_B$ be the effect of drug $B$.

The problem is self-contained, logically consistent, and well-posed, admitting a unique conceptual solution based on the provided definitions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between the number of available receptors, the maximal stimulus that can be generated, and the resulting maximal response.\n\nLet's define the state of the system before the antagonist is administered.\nAt a saturating concentration of the full agonist, all available receptors are occupied. The number of occupied receptors is $R_{A, \\text{initial}}^{\\max} = R_T$.\nThe maximal stimulus generated is $S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}} = \\epsilon \\cdot R_T$.\nThe maximal response observed is $E_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}} = f(S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}) = f(\\epsilon \\cdot R_T)$.\n\nAfter the irreversible antagonist is administered, it permanently inactivates $60\\%$ of the receptors.\nThe new total number of available receptors is $R_T' = (1 - 0.6) \\cdot R_T = 0.4 \\cdot R_T$.\nNow, at a saturating agonist concentration, the maximal number of occupied receptors is $R_{A, \\text{final}}^{\\max} = R_T' = 0.4 \\cdot R_T$.\nThe new maximal stimulus is $S_{\\max}^{\\text{final}} = \\epsilon \\cdot R_{A, \\text{final}}^{\\max} = \\epsilon \\cdot (0.4 \\cdot R_T) = 0.4 \\cdot S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$.\nThe new maximal response is $E_{\\max}^{\\text{final}} = f(S_{\\max}^{\\text{final}}) = f(0.4 \\cdot S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}})$.\n\nNow we analyze the two systems based on these relationships.\n\n**System $\\mathcal{N}$ (No Spare Receptors)**\nThe definition \"achieving $E_{\\max}$ requires essentially full availability and occupancy\" implies that the initial maximal stimulus, $S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$, is just sufficient to produce the maximal response, $E_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$. In this scenario, the stimulus-response function $f(S)$ is not saturated at $S = S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$. A reduction in the maximal stimulus will therefore directly lead to a reduction in the maximal response.\nThe new maximal stimulus is $S_{\\max}^{\\text{final}} = 0.4 \\cdot S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$.\nSince the system is operating in a regime where the response is sensitive to the stimulus level (i.e., not on the plateau of the $f(S)$ curve), the new maximal response $E_{\\max}^{\\text{final}} = f(0.4 \\cdot S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}})$ will be significantly lower than $E_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}} = f(S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}})$. In the simplest interpretation, where stimulus-response coupling is nearly linear in this range, the reduction in response is proportional to the reduction in stimulus. Therefore, $E_{\\max}^{\\text{final}} \\approx 0.4 \\cdot E_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$. The maximal response decreases to approximately $40\\%$ of its baseline value.\n\n**System $\\mathcal{S}$ (Spare Receptors)**\nThe definition \"has spare receptors... $E_{\\max}$ can be reached with less than full receptor availability and occupancy\" implies that the initial maximal stimulus, $S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$, is greater than the stimulus required to achieve the system's absolute maximal response, $E_{\\text{sys}}$. Let $S_{\\text{sat}}$ be the minimum stimulus that produces $E_{\\text{sys}}$. The condition for spare receptors is $S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}} > S_{\\text{sat}}$. In this case, $E_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}} = f(S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}) = E_{\\text{sys}}$, because the stimulus is saturating the response transduction machinery.\n\nAfter the antagonist, the new maximal stimulus is $S_{\\max}^{\\text{final}} = 0.4 \\cdot S_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$. The effect on $E_{\\max}$ now depends on whether this reduced stimulus is still sufficient to saturate the system.\n-   **Case 1: Large Receptor Reserve.** If the new maximal stimulus is still greater than or equal to the saturating stimulus ($S_{\\max}^{\\text{final}} \\ge S_{\\text{sat}}$), then the system can still generate a response of $E_{\\text{sys}}$. So, $E_{\\max}^{\\text{final}} = f(S_{\\max}^{\\text{final}}) = E_{\\text{sys}} = E_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$. The maximal response is unchanged. This occurs if the initial receptor population was large enough to overcome the $60\\%$ loss. The number of receptors required to produce $S_{\\text{sat}}$ is $R_{A, \\text{sat}} = S_{\\text{sat}} / \\epsilon$. The number of \"spare\" receptors is $R_T - R_{A, \\text{sat}}$. If the number of receptors lost ($0.6 \\cdot R_T$) is less than or equal to the number of spare receptors, $E_{\\max}$ is preserved. This condition is $0.6 \\cdot R_T \\le R_T - R_{A, \\text{sat}}$, which rearranges to $R_{A, \\text{sat}} \\le 0.4 \\cdot R_T$. This is equivalent to saying the receptor reserve, $(R_T - R_{A, \\text{sat}})/R_T$, is at least $60\\%$.\n-   **Case 2: Small Receptor Reserve.** If the new maximal stimulus is now less than the saturating stimulus ($S_{\\max}^{\\text{final}}  S_{\\text{sat}}$), the system can no longer generate $E_{\\text{sys}}$. The new maximal response will be $E_{\\max}^{\\text{final}} = f(S_{\\max}^{\\text{final}})  E_{\\text{sys}} = E_{\\max}^{\\text{initial}}$. The maximal response decreases. This happens if the receptor reserve was less than $60\\%$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In System $\\mathcal{N}$, $E_{\\max}$ decreases to $40\\%$ of baseline; in System $\\mathcal{S}$, $E_{\\max}$ is unchanged provided the receptor reserve is at least $60\\%$ of $R_T$, but decreases if the reserve is smaller.**\n-   The analysis for System $\\mathcal{N}$ is consistent with our derivation that a reduction of available receptors to $40\\%$ in a non-reserve system leads to a proportional, or near-proportional, reduction in $E_{\\max}$.\n-   The analysis for System $\\mathcal{S}$ perfectly matches our derivation, correctly identifying the two possible outcomes based on the magnitude of the receptor reserve relative to the fraction of receptors inactivated.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In System $\\mathcal{N}$, $E_{\\max}$ decreases to $60\\%$ of baseline; in System $\\mathcal{S}$, $E_{\\max}$ increases due to sensitization when spare receptors are present.**\n-   The decrease in $E_{\\max}$ for System $\\mathcal{N}$ would be related to the remaining fraction of receptors ($40\\%$), not the inactivated fraction ($60\\%$). So the value is wrong.\n-   The claim that $E_{\\max}$ increases in System $\\mathcal{S}$ is pharmacologically incorrect. Irreversible antagonism reduces the available signaling units; it does not cause sensitization or an increase in maximal response.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In System $\\mathcal{N}$, $E_{\\max}$ is unchanged; in System $\\mathcal{S}$, $E_{\\max}$ decreases to $40\\%$ of baseline because spare receptors are more affected by irreversible antagonists.**\n-   The claim that $E_{\\max}$ is unchanged in System $\\mathcal{N}$ violates the definition of a system with no spare receptors.\n-   The claim that $E_{\\max}$ *always* decreases to $40\\%$ in System $\\mathcal{S}$ is false, as a sufficient reserve will prevent any decrease. The reasoning, \"because spare receptors are more affected,\" is nonsensical; the antagonist acts on the whole receptor population.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In both Systems $\\mathcal{N}$ and $\\mathcal{S}$, $E_{\\max}$ decreases to $40\\%$ of baseline because irreversible antagonism always proportionally lowers $E_{\\max}$ regardless of receptor reserve.**\n-   This statement incorrectly generalizes the effect seen in a non-reserve system to all systems. It explicitly denies the role of receptor reserve, which is the key concept that differentiates the behavior of the two systems. The presence of a receptor reserve can, and often does, make the system resilient to some degree of receptor loss, preventing a decrease in $E_{\\max}$.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4549904"}]}
