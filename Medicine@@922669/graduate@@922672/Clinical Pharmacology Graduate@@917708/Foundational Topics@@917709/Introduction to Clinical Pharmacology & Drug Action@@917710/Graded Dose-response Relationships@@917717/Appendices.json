Assume the Hill coefficient is fixed at $n=1$ based on prior mechanistic knowledge. A phase $2$ study is conducted with doses $d \\in \\{1, 2, 4, 8\\}$ (arbitrary units), with no placebo (so $d=0$ is not included) and no doses beyond $d=8$; the observed dose-response over this range appears approximately proportional to dose, with no obvious saturation.

To resolve this, add $d=0$ to identify $E_{0}$, at least $1$ high dose well into the near-plateau region, and an intermediate dose near the inflection (i.e., $d \\approx EC_{50}$) to expose curvature.\n\nB. $E_{\\max}$ and $EC_{50}$ are not structurally identifiable unless a near-plateau dose is included; however, simply adding more subjects at the existing doses (without adding $d=0$ or high doses) will resolve identifiability.\n\nC. $E_{\\max}$ and $EC_{50}$ are both structurally and practically identifiable from the current doses; adding doses only improves precision, and there is no need to include $d=0$ or any higher doses.\n\nD. The nonidentifiability is purely due to not observing $E_{0}$. If $E_{0}$ is fixed from an independent assay, $E_{\\max}$ and $EC_{50}$ become identifiable without adding any high or intermediate doses; a near-plateau dose is unnecessary.", "solution": "The correct choice is A. Here is the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Structural vs. Practical Identifiability:**\n    *   **Structural identifiability** asks whether it is theoretically possible to determine the parameters from perfect, noise-free data given the model and experimental design. The model has three parameters ($E_0$, $E_{\\max}$, $EC_{50}$). Since the design includes four distinct dose levels, there is enough information in principle to solve for the three unknowns. Thus, the parameters are **structurally identifiable**.\n    *   **Practical identifiability** asks whether the parameters can be estimated with reasonable precision from real, noisy data. This is the core issue here.\n\n2.  **Model Behavior at Low Doses:**\n    *   The problem states that the observed response is \"approximately proportional to dose\" (i.e., linear). This happens when all dose levels ($d$) are much smaller than the $EC_{50}$.\n    *   In the condition where $d \\ll EC_{50}$, the model $E(d) = E_{0} + \\frac{E_{\\max}\\, d}{EC_{50} + d}$ simplifies. The denominator $EC_{50} + d$ becomes approximately equal to $EC_{50}$.\n    *   The model reduces to: $E(d) \\approx E_{0} + \\left(\\frac{E_{\\max}}{EC_{50}}\\right)d$.\n    *   This is the equation of a line with intercept $E_0$ and slope $m = E_{\\max}/EC_{50}$. The experimental data can only estimate this slope, which is the ratio of $E_{\\max}$ and $EC_{50}$. It is impossible to determine the individual values of $E_{\\max}$ and $EC_{50}$ from this ratio alone (e.g., a slope of 2 could come from $E_{\\max}=10, EC_{50}=5$ or $E_{\\max}=20, EC_{50}=10$, etc.). This inability to disentangle parameters from the actual data is **practical nonidentifiability**.\n\n3.  **Resolving Nonidentifiability:**\n    *   To estimate the parameters individually, the experiment must include doses that reveal the full nonlinear shape of the curve.\n    *   Adding a placebo group ($d=0$) directly measures the baseline, $E_0$.\n    *   Adding a high dose (where $d \\gg EC_{50}$) that causes the response to saturate or plateau is essential for estimating the maximal effect, $E_{\\max}$.\n    *   Adding an intermediate dose near the expected $EC_{50}$ (the inflection point) is most effective for estimating $EC_{50}$ itself by capturing the region of maximum curvature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A correctly identifies that the parameters are structurally identifiable but practically nonidentifiable. It also correctly pinpoints the cause—the dose range being confined to the initial linear region, which only informs the ratio $E_{\\max}/EC_{50}$—and proposes the standard, scientifically sound strategy for resolving the issue by augmenting the design to cover the baseline, curvature, and plateau regions of the curve.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4558275"}]}
