This distinction is not merely academic; it has profound implications for patient safety and dose equivalence between different formulations.

[@problem_id:4549709]", "problem": "A hospital formulary committee is harmonizing product strength expressions between oral and parenteral ampicillin products, guided by nomenclature and classification principles in clinical pharmacology.

Express the final result in mg.\n\nIn addition, articulate the labeling implications of expressing strength in terms of the salt versus the active moiety, referencing established nomenclature and pharmacopoeial conventions. Your derivation must be self-contained, starting from the fundamental definitions stated above, and may not assume any shortcut formulas.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on fundamental stoichiometric principles and addresses a legitimate and critical issue in clinical pharmacology and medication safety. All necessary data are provided, and the task is to derive and calculate a quantity and discuss its implications based on established conventions. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts: first, the derivation and calculation of the mass of ampicillin base, and second, the articulation of the labeling implications.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of Ampicillin Base Mass**\n\nThe analysis begins from the fundamental principles provided in the problem statement.\n\n1.  The number of moles, $n$, of a substance is defined as its mass, $m$, divided by its molar mass (or molecular weight), $M$.\n    $$n = \\frac{m}{M}$$\n\n2.  For a simple $1{:}1$ salt, one mole of the salt yields one mole of the active moiety (in this case, the free base) upon dissociation.\n\nLet $m_{\\text{salt}}$ and $M_{\\text{salt}}$ represent the mass and molecular weight of ampicillin sodium, respectively. Let $m_{\\text{base}}$ and $M_{\\text{base}}$ represent the mass and molecular weight of the ampicillin base. The given values are:\n-   Mass of ampicillin sodium, $m_{\\text{salt}} = 500$ mg.\n-   Molecular weight of ampicillin sodium, $M_{\\text{salt}} = 371.39$ g/mol.\n-   Molecular weight of ampicillin base, $M_{\\text{base}} = 349.40$ g/mol.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the number of moles of ampicillin sodium, $n_{\\text{salt}}$, present in the $500$ mg sample. Using the definition from principle (i):\n$$n_{\\text{salt}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{salt}}}{M_{\\text{salt}}}$$\nIt is noted that mass is in milligrams and molecular weight is in grams per mole. The conversion factor will cancel out, so we can proceed, but for rigor, we would convert mass to grams: $m_{\\text{salt}} = 0.500$ g.\n$$n_{\\text{salt}} = \\frac{0.500 \\text{ g}}{371.39 \\text{ g/mol}}$$\n\nAccording to principle (ii), the molar relationship between the salt and the active base is $1{:}1$. Therefore, the number of moles of ampicillin base, $n_{\\text{base}}$, is equal to the number of moles of ampicillin sodium, $n_{\\text{salt}}$.\n$$n_{\\text{base}} = n_{\\text{salt}}$$\n\nTo find the mass of the ampicillin base, $m_{\\text{base}}$, we rearrange the molar definition from principle (i):\n$$m_{\\text{base}} = n_{\\text{base}} \\times M_{\\text{base}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the preceding relationships to derive a single comprehensive expression.\n$$m_{\\text{base}} = n_{\\text{salt}} \\times M_{\\text{base}} = \\left( \\frac{m_{\\text{salt}}}{M_{\\text{salt}}} \\right) \\times M_{\\text{base}}$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$m_{\\text{base}} = m_{\\text{salt}} \\times \\frac{M_{\\text{base}}}{M_{\\text{salt}}}$$\nThis is the required relationship. The ratio $\\frac{M_{\\text{base}}}{M_{\\text{salt}}}$ is a dimensionless conversion factor, often referred to as the salt factor, which directly converts the mass of the salt to the equivalent mass of the active base.\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values into this derived equation to calculate the mass of the ampicillin base.\n$$m_{\\text{base}} = 500 \\text{ mg} \\times \\frac{349.40 \\text{ g/mol}}{371.39 \\text{ g/mol}}$$\nThe units of g/mol cancel, leaving the result in mg.\n$$m_{\\text{base}} = 500 \\times \\frac{349.40}{371.39} \\text{ mg} \\approx 500 \\times 0.9408169... \\text{ mg}$$\n$$m_{\\text{base}} \\approx 470.40845... \\text{ mg}$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final numerical answer to four significant figures.\nThe first four significant figures are $4$, $7$, $0$, and $4$. The fifth digit is $0$, so no rounding up is required.\n$$m_{\\text{base}} = 470.4 \\text{ mg}$$\nThus, a vial containing $500$ mg of ampicillin sodium provides a dose equivalent to $470.4$ mg of ampicillin base.\n\n**Part 2: Labeling Implications and Pharmacopoeial Conventions**\n\nThe discrepancy between expressing drug strength based on the salt form versus the active moiety has significant clinical and safety implications.\n\n1.  **Risk of Medication Errors**: As calculated, $500$ mg of ampicillin sodium is not equivalent to $500$ mg of ampicillin base; it delivers approximately $6$\\% less active drug. If a clinician were to switch a patient from oral ampicillin capsules dosed at $500$ mg (base) to an intravenous form, and incorrectly assumed that a \"$500$ mg\" vial of ampicillin sodium provided an equivalent dose, the patient would be underdosed. Conversely, correctly targeting an IV dose of $500$ mg of ampicillin base would require administering $500 \\text{ mg} / 0.9408... \\approx 531.5$ mg of the sodium salt. Inconsistent labeling across different dosage forms of the same drug creates a high risk of such calculation errors, potentially leading to therapeutic failure (underdosing) or increased risk of toxicity (overdosing).\n\n2.  **Pharmacopoeial and Regulatory Conventions**: To mitigate this risk, major pharmacopoeias and regulatory bodies strongly advocate for standardizing the expression of drug strength. The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) promote labeling based on the active moiety. The active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance, excluding appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt, or other noncovalent derivative.\n\n3.  **Clarity and Therapeutic Equivalence**: By expressing the strength of all product forms (e.g., capsules, tablets, injections) in terms of the active moiety, dose equivalence is made explicit. A \"$500$ mg\" dose of ampicillin would refer to $500$ mg of the active ampicillin molecule, regardless of whether it is administered as the free acid, sodium salt, or another derivative like ampicillin trihydrate. This harmonization simplifies prescribing, dispensing, and administration, thereby enhancing patient safety by removing the need for manual conversions by healthcare professionals at the point of care.\n\nFor the hospital formulary committee, these principles lead to a clear recommendation. To ensure patient safety and align with best practices, the formulary's electronic systems and records should be harmonized. The strength of the ampicillin sodium vial should be recorded and displayed not as \"$500$ mg of ampicillin sodium,\" but as being equivalent to \"$470.4$ mg of ampicillin base.\" This allows for safe and direct therapeutic interchange between oral and parenteral formulations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{470.4}$$", "id": "4549709"}, {"introduction": "The Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) is a scientific framework that categorizes drugs based on their aqueous solubility and intestinal permeability, which are the key determinants of oral drug absorption.

This will be accomplished through a systematic application of established BCS principles and regulatory criteria.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\nThe problem statement is first validated for scientific soundness, completeness, and consistency.\n\n**1.1. Extracted Givens:**\n- Drug: AX-417, oral immediate-release (IR)\n- Chemical nature: Monoprotic weak base\n- Acid dissociation constant: $pK_a = 7.8$\n- Highest proposed market strength (dose): $D = 400\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n- Equilibrium solubility ($37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$):\n  - $C_s(pH\\,1.2) = 40\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$\n  - $C_s(pH\\,4.5) = 8\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$\n  - $C_s(pH\\,6.8) = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$\n- Stability: No chemical degradation in gastrointestinal fluids over $pH = 1$ to $7.5$.\n- Interactions: No complexation with bile salts detected.\n- Mass Balance: $6\\%$ of oral dose recovered as unchanged AX-417 in feces.\n- Bioavailability: Absolute oral bioavailability is $50\\%$, due to extensive first-pass metabolism.\n- Permeability (in vitro): Caco-2 apparent permeability, $P_{\\mathrm{app}} = 20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm/s}$, similar to metoprolol.\n- Formulations: Test and reference IR tablets are qualitatively the same and quantitatively similar in excipients.\n- Dissolution: Both formulations release $\\ge 85\\%$ of the labeled amount by $15\\,\\mathrm{min}$ in $900\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of media at $pH \\approx 1.2$, $4.5$, and $6.8$ (USP Apparatus $2$, $50\\,\\mathrm{rpm}$, $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$).\n- Safety/PK: Not a narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drug; exhibits dose-proportional pharmacokinetics.\n- Excipients: Do not modulate gastrointestinal motility or membrane permeability.\n\n**1.2. Validation against Criteria:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, utilizing standard concepts and terminology from pharmacology and pharmaceutics (BCS, $pK_a$, solubility, permeability, dissolution, biowaiver). The provided data are internally consistent: as a weak base with $pK_a=7.8$, its solubility correctly decreases as $pH$ increases from $1.2$ to $6.8$. The data are sufficient to perform the required classification and assessment. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains no scientific or logical flaws.\n\n**1.3. Verdict:**\nThe problem statement is valid. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Step 2: BCS Classification\n\nThe BCS class is determined by the drug's aqueous solubility and intestinal permeability.\n\n**2.1. Solubility Classification:**\nAccording to regulatory guidelines (e.g., FDA), a drug substance is considered **Highly Soluble** if its highest single therapeutic dose is completely soluble in $250\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ or less of aqueous media over the pH range of $1$ to $6.8$ at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\n- Highest dose, $D = 400\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n- Test volume, $V = 250\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n- The required minimum solubility, $C_{s,req}$, to dissolve the dose in this volume is:\n$$ C_{s,req} = \\frac{D}{V} = \\frac{400\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{250\\,\\mathrm{mL}} = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL} $$\n- To be classified as highly soluble, the drug's equilibrium solubility must be greater than or equal to $C_{s,req}$ at the \"worst-case\" $pH$ within the range of $1$ to $6.8$. For a weak base, solubility is lowest at the highest $pH$.\n- The provided data points cover the required range. The lowest solubility is observed at the highest $pH$ tested, $pH = 6.8$.\n- The measured solubility at $pH=6.8$ is $C_s(pH\\,6.8) = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$.\n- Comparing the measured minimum solubility to the required solubility:\n$$ C_s(pH\\,6.8) = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL} \\ge C_{s,req} = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL} $$\n- Since the condition is met, AX-417 is classified as **Highly Soluble**.\n\n**2.2. Permeability Classification:**\nA drug substance is considered **Highly Permeable** when the extent of absorption in humans is determined to be $\\ge 85\\%$ of an administered dose, based on mass-balance studies or comparison to an appropriate reference drug.\n\n- The human radiolabeled mass-balance study provides the most direct evidence for the extent of absorption. It reported that $6\\%$ of the oral dose was recovered as unchanged drug in feces.\n- The fraction of the dose that remains unabsorbed is equal to the fraction recovered as unchanged drug in feces.\n- Fraction Unabsorbed $= 6\\% = 0.06$.\n- The extent of absorption ($F_a$) is therefore:\n$$ F_a = 1 - (\\text{fraction unchanged in feces}) = 1 - 0.06 = 0.94 $$\n- This corresponds to an extent of absorption of $94\\%$.\n- The criterion for high permeability is $F_a \\ge 85\\%$. Since $94\\% \\ge 85\\%$, AX-417 is classified as **Highly Permeable**.\n- The low absolute bioavailability of $50\\%$ is explicitly attributed to extensive first-pass metabolism, which occurs *after* the drug has been absorbed from the gastrointestinal lumen. Absolute bioavailability is not the metric for permeability classification under BCS guidelines.\n- The in vitro Caco-2 data, $P_{\\mathrm{app}} = 20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm/s}$, which is similar to that of the high-permeability standard metoprolol, further corroborates the high permeability classification.\n\n**2.3. BCS Class Conclusion:**\n- Solubility: High\n- Permeability: High\n- Therefore, AX-417 is a **BCS Class I** drug.\n\n### Step 3: Biowaiver Justification\n\nA BCS-based biowaiver for an immediate-release solid oral dosage form is considered based on its BCS class and formulation characteristics. For a **BCS Class I** drug, the criteria are as follows:\n\n1.  **Drug Classification:** The drug must be BCS Class I. This is met.\n2.  **Dissolution:** The IR product must be **Very Rapidly Dissolving**, which is defined as $\\ge 85\\%$ release in $15$ minutes in all three standard media ($0.1\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{HCl}$, $pH=4.5$ buffer, and $pH=6.8$ buffer). The problem states that both test and reference formulations meet this criterion. This is met.\n3.  **Excipients:** Excipients must be well-established and should not affect absorption. The problem states the test and reference formulations are qualitatively the same and quantitatively similar, and contain no excipients known to modulate GI motility or permeability. This is met.\n4.  **Therapeutic Index:** The drug should not be a narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drug. The problem states this is the case. This is met.\n\nSince all criteria for a BCS Class I-based biowaiver are fulfilled, a biowaiver is **justified**.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluation of Options\n\n- **A. BCS Class I; a BCS-based biowaiver is justified.**\n  This option correctly identifies AX-417 as a BCS Class I drug and correctly concludes that a biowaiver is justified based on the provided dissolution and formulation data. This aligns perfectly with the derivation.\n  **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. BCS Class II; a BCS-based biowaiver is not justified.**\n  This option incorrectly classifies the drug as BCS Class II (Low Solubility, High Permeability). As demonstrated, the drug is highly soluble.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. BCS Class I; a BCS-based biowaiver is not justified because the absolute bioavailability is less than 85%.**\n  This option correctly identifies the drug as BCS Class I, but incorrectly states that a biowaiver is not justified. The reasoning provided is fundamentally flawed: permeability classification is based on the extent of absorption ($F_a$), not absolute bioavailability ($F_{abs}$). Low bioavailability due to first-pass metabolism does not disqualify a highly permeable drug from a biowaiver.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. BCS Class III; a BCS-based biowaiver is justified.**\n  This option incorrectly classifies the drug as BCS Class III (High Solubility, Low Permeability). As demonstrated, the drug is highly permeable.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, only option A is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4549688"}, {"introduction": "To manage and study drug use on a global scale, a standardized classification system is indispensable.

No invalidating flaws are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the ATC Code\n\nThe ATC code is determined by a hierarchical process, moving from the broadest anatomical group to the specific chemical substance.\n\n**Level 1: Anatomical Main Group**\nThe drug, remgaliflozin, is indicated for Type $2$ diabetes mellitus, a metabolic disease. The ATC anatomical main group for drugs acting on the \"Alimentary tract and metabolism\" is designated by the letter **`A`**. While the drug has secondary cardiorenal effects (implying relevance to group `C` - Cardiovascular system), the primary indication dictates the classification. Therefore, the first character is `A`.\n\n**Level 2: Therapeutic Main Group**\nWithin group `A`, the therapeutic main group for \"Drugs used in diabetes\" is **`A10`**. Since remgaliflozin's primary purpose is glycemic control in diabetes, this is the correct classification. The code is now `A10`.\n\n**Level 3: Pharmacological/Therapeutic Subgroup**\nWithin `A10`, subgroups differentiate between insulins and other blood glucose lowering drugs. Remgaliflozin is an orally administered drug, not an insulin. The subgroup for \"Blood glucose lowering drugs, excl. insulins\" is **`A10B`**. The code is now `A10B`.\n\n**Level 4: Chemical Subgroup**\nWithin `A10B`, drugs are grouped by their chemical structure or mechanism of action. The problem states remgaliflozin is an SGLT$2$ inhibitor. Crucially, the problem provides that the currently occupied codes for SGLT$2$ inhibitors are in the range $\\mathrm{A10BK01}$ through $\\mathrm{A10BK06}$. This explicitly identifies the chemical subgroup for SGLT$2$ inhibitors as a four-letter code ending in **`K`**. Therefore, the code is now `A10BK`.\n\n**Level 5: Chemical Substance**\nThis level identifies the specific active substance. The codes are assigned sequentially as new drugs are classified within a Level 4 subgroup. The problem states that the existing SGLT$2$ inhibitors occupy codes up to $\\mathrm{A10BK06}$ and that \"the next available sequential code is $\\mathrm{A10BK07}$\". As remgaliflozin is a new substance in this class, it must be assigned this next available code. The final two digits are **`07`**.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**\nCombining all levels, the complete ATC code for remgaliflozin is $\\mathrm{A10BK07}$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $\\mathrm{A10BK07}$**\n- **Analysis:** This code is derived as follows:\n    - `A`: Alimentary tract and metabolism. Correct.\n    - `A10`: Drugs used in diabetes. Correct.\n    - `A10B`: Blood glucose lowering drugs, excl. insulins. Correct.\n    - `A10BK`: Sodium-glucose co-transporter $2$ (SGLT$2$) inhibitors. Correct.\n    - `A10BK07`: The specific substance code, assigned sequentially as the next available number. Correct.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. $\\mathrm{C03AB}$**\n- **Analysis:** This code corresponds to `C` (Cardiovascular system) $\\rightarrow$ `C03` (Diuretics) $\\rightarrow$ `C03A` (Low-ceiling diuretics, thiazides) $\\rightarrow$ `C03AB` (Thiazide analogues, plain). While SGLT$2$ inhibitors induce osmotic diuresis, this is a secondary effect, not their primary therapeutic classification. Furthermore, they are not thiazide-like diuretics. This classification is incorrect at every level after the root.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $\\mathrm{A10BD}$**\n- **Analysis:** This code corresponds to `A10B` (Blood glucose lowering drugs, excl. insulins) followed by the chemical subgroup `D`. In the ATC system, `A10BD` is the subgroup for \"Combinations of oral blood glucose lowering drugs\". The problem explicitly states that remgaliflozin is \"not formulated as a fixed-dose combination\". Thus, this classification is incorrect.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $\\mathrm{A10BJ}$**\n- **Analysis:** This code corresponds to `A10B` (Blood glucose lowering drugs, excl. insulins) followed by the chemical subgroup `J`. In the ATC system, `A10BJ` is the subgroup for \"Glucagon-like peptide-$1$ (GLP-$1$) analogues\". Remgaliflozin is an SGLT$2$ inhibitor, which is a pharmacologically distinct class from GLP-$1$ analogues.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. $\\mathrm{A16AX}$**\n- **Analysis:** This code corresponds to `A` (Alimentary tract and metabolism) $\\rightarrow$ `A16` (Other alimentary tract and metabolism products).
