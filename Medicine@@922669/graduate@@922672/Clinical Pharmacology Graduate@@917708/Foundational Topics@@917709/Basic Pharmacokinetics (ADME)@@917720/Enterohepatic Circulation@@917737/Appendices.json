The drug distributes in a single central compartment of volume $V$ and, in the absence of recycling, is eliminated from the body by a first-order process with rate constant $k_{e}$, so that the concentration-time profile is log-linear in the terminal phase. Enterohepatic circulation (EHC) is introduced as follows: in addition to elimination characterized by $k_{e}$, drug is transferred from the central compartment to a gut reservoir by a first-order biliary excretion rate constant $k_{b}$. Drug in the gut reservoir can be reabsorbed back into the central compartment with first-order rate constant $k_{re}$ or lost irreversibly via fecal elimination with rate constant $k_{f}$. Let $A_{c}(t)$ and $A_{g}(t)$ denote the amounts of drug in the central and gut reservoir compartments, respectively, and assume $A_{c}(0)=D$ and $A_{g}(0)=0$.

The description of enterohepatic circulation is consistent with established physiological and pharmacological models. The problem is well-posed; it is an initial value problem for a system of linear ODEs, which has a unique solution. The definitions of terminal rate constant and half-life are standard in the field. The provided parameters are dimensionally consistent and physically reasonable. The problem is objective and free of ambiguity. It is a formalizable and relevant problem within clinical pharmacology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n###\nThe solution consists of three main parts: calculating the half-life without EHC, calculating the half-life with EHC, and finally computing their ratio.\n\n**Part 1: Half-life without EHC**\n\nIn the absence of EHC, the problem states to set $k_{b}=0$ and disregard the gut reservoir. The dynamics of the drug amount in the central compartment, $A_c(t)$, are described by the simplified differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dA_{c}}{dt} = -k_{e}A_{c} $$\nGiven the initial condition $A_{c}(0)=D$, this first-order linear ODE has the solution:\n$$ A_{c}(t) = D \\exp(-k_{e}t) $$\nThe concentration in the central compartment is $C(t) = \\frac{A_{c}(t)}{V} = \\frac{D}{V} \\exp(-k_{e}t)$.\nTo find the terminal rate constant $\\lambda_{z}$, we first take the natural logarithm of the concentration:\n$$ \\ln C(t) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{D}{V}\\right) - k_{e}t $$\nThe long-time derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}(\\ln C(t)) = -k_{e} $$\nThe apparent terminal rate constant, $\\lambda_{z, \\text{no EHC}}$, is the negative of this derivative:\n$$ \\lambda_{z, \\text{no EHC}} = -(-k_{e}) = k_{e} $$\nThe corresponding terminal half-life, $t_{1/2, \\text{no EHC}}$, is:\n$$ t_{1/2, \\text{no EHC}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\lambda_{z, \\text{no EHC}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{e}} $$\n\n**Part 2: Half-life with EHC**\n\nWith EHC, the system is described by the two coupled linear ODEs:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\begin{pmatrix} A_{c} \\\\ A_{g} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -(k_{e} + k_{b}) & k_{re} \\\\ k_{b} & -(k_{re} + k_{f}) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} A_{c} \\\\ A_{g} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis is a system of the form $\\frac{d\\mathbf{A}}{dt} = \\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{A}$, where $\\mathbf{M}$ is the matrix of rate constants. The solution for $A_{c}(t)$ is a sum of exponential terms, $A_{c}(t) = K_{1}\\exp(\\lambda_{1}t) + K_{2}\\exp(\\lambda_{2}t)$, where $\\lambda_{1}$ and $\\lambda_{2}$ are the eigenvalues of the matrix $\\mathbf{M}$. The terminal phase (long-time behavior) is governed by the exponential term that decays most slowly, which corresponds to the eigenvalue with the smallest magnitude (i.e., closest to zero). Let this be $\\lambda_{\\text{slow}}$.\nThe terminal rate constant $\\lambda_{z, \\text{EHC}}$ is the magnitude of this slowest decay rate, so $\\lambda_{z, \\text{EHC}} = -\\lambda_{\\text{slow}}$.

So,\n$$ \\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{-(k_e+k_b+k_{re}+k_f) \\pm \\sqrt{((k_e+k_b)-(k_{re}+k_f))^2 + 4k_b k_{re}}}{2} $$\nSince all rate constants are positive, both eigenvalues are real and negative. The slower eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\text{slow}}$, is the one with the smaller magnitude, which is the larger value (closer to zero):\n$$ \\lambda_{\\text{slow}} = \\frac{-(k_e+k_b+k_{re}+k_f) + \\sqrt{((k_e+k_b)-(k_{re}+k_f))^2 + 4k_b k_{re}}}{2} $$\nThe terminal rate constant is $\\lambda_{z, \\text{EHC}} = -\\lambda_{\\text{slow}}$:\n$$ \\lambda_{z, \\text{EHC}} = \\frac{(k_e+k_b+k_{re}+k_f) - \\sqrt{((k_e+k_b)-(k_{re}+k_f))^2 + 4k_b k_{re}}}{2} $$\nThe half-life with EHC is then $t_{1/2, \\text{EHC}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\lambda_{z, \\text{EHC}}}$.\n\n**Part 3: Ratio of Half-lives**\n\nThe required ratio $R$ is:\n$$ R = \\frac{t_{1/2, \\text{EHC}}}{t_{1/2, \\text{no EHC}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2) / \\lambda_{z, \\text{EHC}}}{\\ln(2) / k_{e}} = \\frac{k_{e}}{\\lambda_{z, \\text{EHC}}} $$\n\n**Part 4: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the parameter values: $k_{e}=0.30$, $k_{b}=0.10$, $k_{re}=0.020$, and $k_{f}=0.010$ (all in $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$).\nFirst, we compute the necessary sums and products:\n$$ k_e+k_b = 0.30 + 0.10 = 0.40 $$\n$$ k_{re}+k_f = 0.020 + 0.010 = 0.030 $$\n$$ k_e+k_b+k_{re}+k_f = 0.40 + 0.030 = 0.43 $$\n$$ (k_e+k_b)-(k_{re}+k_f) = 0.40 - 0.030 = 0.37 $$\n$$ 4k_b k_{re} = 4(0.10)(0.020) = 4(0.002) = 0.008 $$\nNow, we substitute these into the expression for $\\lambda_{z, \\text{EHC}}$:\n$$ \\lambda_{z, \\text{EHC}} = \\frac{0.43 - \\sqrt{(0.37)^2 + 0.008}}{2} $$\n$$ \\lambda_{z, \\text{EHC}} = \\frac{0.43 - \\sqrt{0.1369 + 0.008}}{2} = \\frac{0.43 - \\sqrt{0.1449}}{2} $$\nCalculating the square root: $\\sqrt{0.1449} \\approx 0.3806573$.\n$$ \\lambda_{z, \\text{EHC}} \\approx \\frac{0.43 - 0.3806573}{2} = \\frac{0.0493427}{2} \\approx 0.02467135\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{k_{e}}{\\lambda_{z, \\text{EHC}}} \\approx \\frac{0.30}{0.02467135} \\approx 12.1598... $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $12.2$.\nThe presence of enterohepatic circulation, under these specific parameters, increases the terminal half-life by a factor of approximately $12.2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12.2}$$", "id": "4552485"}, {"introduction": "Beyond altering the drug's persistence, enterohepatic circulation increases the total systemic exposure, a critical parameter in assessing efficacy and toxicity.

Taking the negative base-$10$ logarithm of the $K_{a}$ expression yields:\n$$\n-\\log_{10}(K_{a}) = -\\log_{10}([H^{+}]) - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions of $pK_{a}$ and $pH$:\n$$\npK_{a} = pH - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\\right)\n$$\nThis rearranges to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$\npH = pK_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\\right)\n$$\nFrom this equation, we can express the ratio of the ionized to unionized species:\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\\right) = pH - pK_{a}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]} = 10^{pH - pK_{a}}\n$$\nThe fraction unionized, $f_{\\mathrm{U}}$, is the concentration of the unionized species, $[HA]$, divided by the total concentration of the drug, $[C_{\\text{total}}] = [HA] + [A^{-}]$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{[HA]}{[C_{\\text{total}}]} = \\frac{[HA]}{[HA] + [A^{-}]}\n$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $[HA]$ gives:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the ratio $\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_{a}}}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the fraction unionized for a monoprotic weak acid.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Fraction Reabsorbed ($F$)**\n\nThe problem states that drug uptake from the lumen follows apparent first-order kinetics. Let $M(t)$ be the mass of the drug in a differential fluid volume as it transits the ileum. The rate of change of this mass due to reabsorption is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = -k M(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the apparent first-order uptake rate constant. This is a linear first-order ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables and integrating. Let $M_0$ be the initial mass of the drug entering the ileal segment at time $t=0$.\n$$\n\\int_{M_0}^{M(t)} \\frac{dM}{M} = \\int_0^t -k \\, dt'\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{M(t)}{M_0}\\right) = -kt\n$$\n$$\nM(t) = M_0 \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThe residence time in the ileum is given as $t$. The mass of drug remaining at the end of the segment is $M(t)$. The fraction of drug remaining is $\\frac{M(t)}{M_0} = \\exp(-kt)$. The fraction reabsorbed, $F$, is equal to $1$ minus the fraction remaining:\n$$\nF = 1 - \\frac{M(t)}{M_0} = 1 - \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the apparent rate constant $k$ is related to the intrinsic uptake rate constant of the unionized species, $k_{\\mathrm{u}}$, and the fraction unionized, $f_{\\mathrm{U}}$, by the expression $k = k_{\\mathrm{u}}f_{\\mathrm{U}}$. Substituting this into the equation for $F$ yields the desired expression:\n$$\nF = 1 - \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{u}}f_{\\mathrm{U}}t)\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation of $F$**\n\nWe now substitute the given values into the derived expressions.\nGiven parameters:\n- $pK_{a} = 4.5$\n- $pH = 7.0$\n- $k_{\\mathrm{u}} = 3.0\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$\n- $t = 1.5\\,\\text{h}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the fraction unionized, $f_{\\mathrm{U}}$:\n$$\npH - pK_{a} = 7.0 - 4.5 = 2.5\n$$\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_{a}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{2.5}}\n$$\nNumerically, $10^{2.5} = 10^{2} \\times 10^{0.5} = 100\\sqrt{10} \\approx 316.227766$.\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 316.227766} = \\frac{1}{317.227766} \\approx 0.00315227\n$$\nNext, we calculate the enterohepatic recycling efficiency per pass, $F$:\n$$\nF = 1 - \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{u}}f_{\\mathrm{U}}t)\n$$\nThe product in the exponent is:\n$$\n-k_{\\mathrm{u}}f_{\\mathrm{U}}t = -(3.0\\,\\text{h}^{-1}) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{2.5}}\\right) \\times (1.5\\,\\text{h})\n$$\n$$\n-k_{\\mathrm{u}}f_{\\mathrm{U}}t = -4.5 \\times \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{2.5}}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical value of the fraction:\n$$\n-k_{\\mathrm{u}}f_{\\mathrm{U}}t \\approx -4.5 \\times 0.00315227 \\approx -0.01418522\n$$\nNow we can compute $F$:\n$$\nF = 1 - \\exp(-0.01418522) \\approx 1 - 0.98591039 \\approx 0.01408961\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nF \\approx 0.01409\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.01409}\n$$", "id": "4552472"}]}
