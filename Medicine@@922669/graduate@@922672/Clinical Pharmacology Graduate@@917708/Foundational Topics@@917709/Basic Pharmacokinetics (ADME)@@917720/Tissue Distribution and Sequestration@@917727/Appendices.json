The language is objective and the assumptions (e.g., passive diffusion, rapid equilibrium) are standard for creating a tractable model of a complex biological process. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\n\nThe fraction of unbound drug in plasma, $f_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}}$, is defined as the ratio of the unbound drug concentration in plasma, $C_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}}$, to the total drug concentration in plasma, $C_{\\mathrm{total, plasma}}$:\n$$ f_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}} = \\frac{C_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}}}{C_{\\mathrm{total, plasma}}} $$\nSimilarly, the fraction of unbound drug in tissue, $f_{u,\\mathrm{tissue}}$, is defined as the ratio of the unbound drug concentration in tissue, $C_{u,\\mathrm{tissue}}$, to the total drug concentration in tissue, $C_{\\mathrm{total, tissue}}$:\n$$ f_{u,\\mathrm{tissue}} = \\frac{C_{u,\\mathrm{tissue}}}{C_{\\mathrm{total, tissue}}} $$\nThese equations can be rearranged to express the total concentrations in terms of the unbound concentrations and the unbound fractions:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{total, plasma}} = \\frac{C_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}}}{f_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}}} $$\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{total, tissue}} = \\frac{C_{u,\\mathrm{tissue}}}{f_{u,\\mathrm{tissue}}} $$\nA core assumption of the problem is that the system is at distribution equilibrium, and the unbound drug concentrations across the plasma-tissue interface are equal. This is a common and fundamental assumption for passively diffusing small molecules.\n$$ C_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}} = C_{u,\\mathrm{tissue}} $$\nThe tissue-to-plasma partition coefficient, $K_{p}$, is defined as the ratio of the total drug concentration in tissue to the total drug concentration in plasma at equilibrium:\n$$ K_{p} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{total, tissue}}}{C_{\\mathrm{total, plasma}}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the total concentrations into the definition of $K_{p}$:\n$$ K_{p} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{C_{u,\\mathrm{tissue}}}{f_{u,\\mathrm{tissue}}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{C_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}}}{f_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}}}\\right)} $$\nSince $C_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}} = C_{u,\\mathrm{tissue}}$, these terms in the numerator and denominator cancel, simplifying the expression for $K_{p}$ to a ratio of the unbound fractions:\n$$ K_{p} = \\frac{f_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}}}{f_{u,\\mathrm{tissue}}} $$\nThis equation is a fundamental relationship in pharmacokinetics, often referred to as the Øie-Tozer equation in a simplified form. It shows that tissue partitioning is governed by the relative binding of the drug in plasma versus tissue.\n\nWe are given the values $f_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}} = 0.1$ and $f_{u,\\mathrm{tissue}} = 0.02$. Substituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$ K_{p} = \\frac{0.1}{0.02} = 5 $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, $K_{p} = 5.00$.\n\nFor the qualitative commentary, the volume of distribution at steady state ($V_{ss}$) is a pharmacokinetic parameter that relates the total amount of drug in the body at steady state to the drug concentration in plasma. A simplified, yet general, equation for $V_{ss}$ is:\n$$ V_{ss} = V_p + V_t \\cdot K_p $$\nwhere $V_p$ is the plasma volume, $V_t$ is the volume of the tissue compartment, and $K_p$ is the tissue-to-plasma partition coefficient. Our calculated value is $K_p = 5.00$. Since $K_p > 1$, this indicates that the total drug concentration in the tissue is $5$ times higher than the total drug concentration in the plasma at equilibrium. This imbalance is driven by the much lower fraction unbound in tissue ($f_{u,\\mathrm{tissue}} = 0.02$) compared to plasma ($f_{u,\\mathrm{plasma}} = 0.1$), signifying more extensive binding to tissue components than to plasma proteins. Consequently, the drug is substantially sequestered in the tissue compartment, away from the central plasma compartment. This extensive tissue distribution and sequestration will result in a large apparent volume of distribution at steady state ($V_{ss}$), a value that would be significantly greater than physiological volumes like plasma volume (approximately $3$ L) or total body water (approximately $42$ L).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{5.00}\n$$", "id": "4599337"}, {"introduction": "While protein binding is a major determinant of distribution, powerful physicochemical mechanisms can also lead to significant tissue sequestration.

Qualitative Explanation of Accumulation**\n\nThe derived ratio, $\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{T,L}}}{C_{\\mathrm{T,P}}} \\approx 232.8$, is significantly greater than $1$, indicating a substantial accumulation of the weak base in the lysosomal compartment relative to the plasma. This phenomenon, known as ion trapping, can be explained as follows:\n\nThe **direction** of accumulation is into the lysosome, the more acidic compartment. The **magnitude** is substantial, with the total concentration being over $230$ times higher in the lysosome.\n\nThe underlying principle is that the membrane is permeable only to the neutral form of the drug, $\\mathrm{B}$, which equilibrates to have the same concentration, $[\\mathrm{B}]_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, on both sides. However, the total drug concentration in each compartment also includes the charged, membrane-impermeant form, $\\mathrm{BH}^+$.\n\nThe lysosome is highly acidic ($pH_{\\mathrm{L}} = 5.0$) compared to the plasma ($pH_{\\mathrm{P}} = 7.4$). For a weak base with $pK_a = 8.5$, the equilibrium $\\mathrm{B} + \\mathrm{H}^+ \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{BH}^+$ is driven strongly to the right in the acidic environment of the lysosome. As calculated, the fraction of unionized drug in the lysosome ($f_{\\mathrm{unionized, L}} \\approx 0.0003$) is exceedingly small; over $99.9\\%$ of the drug is \"trapped\" as the charged $\\mathrm{BH}^+$ form. In the less acidic plasma, the fraction of unionized drug is much larger ($f_{\\mathrm{unionized, P}} \\approx 0.07$), meaning only about $92.6\\%$ is in the charged form.\n\nTo maintain the equilibrium where $[\\mathrm{B}]_{\\mathrm{L}} = [\\mathrm{B}]_{\\mathrm{P}}$, a very large total amount of drug must accumulate inside the lysosome. Essentially, the lysosome acts as a \"sink\" for the neutral base $\\mathrm{B}$ that diffuses in from the plasma. As soon as $\\mathrm{B}$ enters the lysosome, it is rapidly protonated to $\\mathrm{BH}^+$ and trapped, thus maintaining a low concentration of free $\\mathrm{B}$ inside and driving further influx from the plasma until a steady-state equilibrium is reached. This leads to the very high lysosome-to-plasma concentration ratio.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.07359 & 0.0003161 & 232.8 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4599308"}, {"introduction": "A drug's overall distribution in the body is not uniform but is a composite of its partitioning into numerous individual tissues.

The requested derivation, calculation, and mechanistic interpretation are standard procedures in this field.\n\nThe derivation for the steady-state volume of distribution, $V_{ss}$, begins with the fundamental principle of mass balance. At steady state, the total amount of drug in the body, $A_{ss}$, is the sum of the amount of drug in the plasma, $A_p$, and the amounts in each of the tissue compartments, $A_i$.\n$$A_{ss} = A_p + \\sum_{i} A_i$$\nThe amount of drug in any compartment is defined as the product of the drug concentration in that compartment and the compartment's volume. Let $C_p$ be the plasma concentration and $V_p$ be the plasma volume. Let $C_i$ and $V_i$ be the concentration and volume of the $i$-th tissue, respectively.\n$$A_p = C_p V_p$$\n$$A_i = C_i V_i$$\nSubstituting these definitions into the mass balance equation gives:\n$$A_{ss} = C_p V_p + \\sum_{i} (C_i V_i)$$\nThe problem states that at steady state, a constant tissue-to-plasma partition coefficient, $K_{p,i}$, relates the concentration in a tissue to the concentration in plasma.\n$$K_{p,i} = \\frac{C_i}{C_p}$$\nThis relationship can be rearranged to express the tissue concentration in terms of the plasma concentration:\n$$C_i = K_{p,i} C_p$$\nSubstituting this expression for $C_i$ into the equation for $A_{ss}$ allows us to express the total amount of drug in the body solely in terms of the plasma concentration and the system parameters:\n$$A_{ss} = C_p V_p + \\sum_{i} (K_{p,i} C_p V_i)$$\nFactoring out the common term $C_p$ yields:\n$$A_{ss} = C_p \\left( V_p + \\sum_{i} K_{p,i} V_i \\right)$$\nThe steady-state volume of distribution, $V_{ss}$, is defined as the apparent volume into which the drug has distributed at steady state.

The summation term is expanded as:\n$$\\sum_{i} K_{p,i} V_i = (K_{p,\\text{liver}} V_{\\text{liver}}) + (K_{p,\\text{muscle}} V_{\\text{muscle}}) + (K_{p,\\text{fat}} V_{\\text{fat}}) + (K_{p,\\text{brain}} V_{\\text{brain}})$$\nThe given values are:\n$V_{p} = 3$ L\n$V_{\\text{liver}} = 1.5$ L, $K_{p,\\text{liver}} = 2$\n$V_{\\text{muscle}} = 30$ L, $K_{p,\\text{muscle}} = 0.8$\n$V_{\\text{fat}} = 14$ L, $K_{p,\\text{fat}} = 5$\n$V_{\\text{brain}} = 1.4$ L, $K_{p,\\text{brain}} = 0.6$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $V_{ss}$:\n$$V_{ss} = 3 + (2 \\times 1.5) + (0.8 \\times 30) + (5 \\times 14) + (0.6 \\times 1.4)$$\n$$V_{ss} = 3 + 3 + 24 + 70 + 0.84$$\n$$V_{ss} = 100.84 \\text{ L}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives:\n$$V_{ss} \\approx 101 \\text{ L}$$\n\nFinally, we identify which tissue(s) contribute most to $V_{ss}$ by examining the mathematical structure of the derived equation, $V_{ss} = V_p + \\sum_{i} K_{p,i} V_{i}$. This equation shows that $V_{ss}$ is a sum of contributions from the plasma and from each tissue. The contribution of a given tissue $i$ to the total $V_{ss}$ is not its physical volume $V_i$ alone, nor its partition coefficient $K_{p,i}$ alone, but their product: $K_{p,i} V_{i}$. This product represents the \"effective\" volume of the tissue compartment, scaled by the drug's affinity for that tissue relative to plasma.\n\nLet's calculate the contribution of each component to the total $V_{ss}$:\nContribution from plasma: $V_p = 3$ L\nContribution from liver: $K_{p,\\text{liver}} V_{\\text{liver}} = 2 \\times 1.5 = 3$ L\nContribution from muscle: $K_{p,\\text{muscle}} V_{\\text{muscle}} = 0.8 \\times 30 = 24$ L\nContribution from fat: $K_{p,\\text{fat}} V_{\\text{fat}} = 5 \\times 14 = 70$ L\nContribution from brain: $K_{p,\\text{brain}} V_{\\text{brain}} = 0.6 \\times 1.4 = 0.84$ L\n\nThe total $V_{ss}$ is the sum of these values: $3 + 3 + 24 + 70 + 0.84 = 100.84$ L.\n\nComparing the individual contributions, the fat tissue provides the largest contribution with a value of $70$ L. This accounts for approximately $\\frac{70}{100.84} \\times 100\\% \\approx 69.4\\%$ of the total steady-state volume of distribution.\n\nThe mechanistic justification is tied directly to the product term $K_{p,i} V_{i}$. Fat tissue contributes the most because it has both a high partition coefficient ($K_{p,\\text{fat}} = 5$, the highest of all tissues), indicating significant sequestration of the lipophilic drug, and a substantial physiological volume ($V_{\\text{fat}} = 14$ L). Although muscle tissue has a much larger physical volume ($V_{\\text{muscle}} = 30$ L), its lower partition coefficient ($K_{p,\\text{muscle}} = 0.8$) results in a smaller overall contribution ($24$ L) to $V_{ss}$. Therefore, the fat tissue's combination of high affinity and large volume makes it the primary reservoir for this drug in the body at steady state.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{101}\n$$", "id": "4599352"}]}
