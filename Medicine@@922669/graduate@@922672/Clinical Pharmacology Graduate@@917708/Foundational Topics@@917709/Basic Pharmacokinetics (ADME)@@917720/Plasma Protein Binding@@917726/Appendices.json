This capacity represents the upper limit of drug concentration that can be bound, which occurs when all binding sites are saturated.\n\nBased on the definition of molar concentration and stoichiometry, the concentration of binding sites, $[S_i]$, contributed by a specific macromolecular species $i$ is the product of the molar concentration of that species, $C_i$, and the number of binding sites per molecule or particle of that species, $n_i$.\n$$[S_i] = n_i \\times C_i$$\n\nThe total maximum binding capacity is the sum of the binding site concentrations from all contributing species.\n$$[S_{total}] = \\sum_i [S_i] = \\sum_i (n_i C_i)$$\n\nThe problem states that for the purpose of this conceptual regime, we are to assume that each macromolecule or lipoprotein particle contributes exactly one binding site. Therefore, for all species $i$ (albumin, AAG, HDL, LDL, VLDL), the stoichiometry is $n_i = 1$.\nThe expression for total binding capacity simplifies to the sum of the concentrations of the macromolecular species themselves:\n$$[S_{total}] = C_{Alb} + C_{AAG} + C_{HDL} + C_{LDL} + C_{VLDL}$$\n\nNow, we must evaluate this expression numerically. The final answer is required in units of $\\mu\\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{L}$, which is equivalent to micromolar ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$). We must first convert all given concentrations to these units.\n\nThe given concentrations are:\n- $C_{Alb} = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n- $C_{AAG} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $C_{HDL} = 30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $C_{LDL} = 1.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $C_{VLDL} = 0.10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nThe concentration of albumin must be converted from millimolar ($\\mathrm{mM}$) to micromolar ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$). The conversion factor is $1\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n$$C_{Alb} = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{mM} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1\\,\\mathrm{mM}} = 600\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n\nThe other concentrations are already in the required units. Now we can sum the concentrations to find the total concentration of binding sites.\n$$[S_{total}] = 600\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 1.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 0.10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n$$[S_{total}] = (600 + 20 + 30 + 1.2 + 0.10)\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n$$[S_{total}] = 651.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n\nThe result is $651.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.
