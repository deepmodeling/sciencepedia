The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental principles. At steady state, the rate of drug entering the liver must equal the sum of the rate of drug leaving the liver and the rate of drug being eliminated within the liver. This can be expressed as a mass balance equation.\n\nLet $Q_h$ be the hepatic blood flow, $C_a$ be the drug concentration in the blood entering the liver (arterial), and $C_v$ be the drug concentration in the blood leaving the liver (venous).\nThe rate of drug entry into the liver is $Q_h C_a$.\nThe rate of drug leaving the liver is $Q_h C_v$.\n\nThe rate of elimination within the liver is determined by the intrinsic clearance, $CL_{int}$, and the concentration of unbound drug available to the enzymes. The well-stirred model assumes instantaneous and uniform distribution of the drug throughout the liver, such that the drug concentration in the emergent venous blood, $C_v$, is representative of the total drug concentration within the liver sinusoids. The unbound drug concentration in the liver is therefore assumed to be in equilibrium with the unbound drug in the venous blood.\n\nLet $f_u$ be the fraction of drug unbound in plasma. The unbound drug concentration within the liver is $f_u C_v$.\nThe rate of elimination is therefore given by $CL_{int} \\cdot (f_u C_v)$.\n\nThe steady-state mass balance equation is:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Entry} = \\text{Rate of Exit} + \\text{Rate of Elimination} $$\n$$ Q_h C_a = Q_h C_v + f_u \\cdot CL_{int} \\cdot C_v $$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the ratio $C_v / C_a$:\n$$ Q_h C_a = (Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}) C_v $$\n$$ \\frac{C_v}{C_a} = \\frac{Q_h}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}} $$\n\nThe hepatic extraction fraction, $E_h$, is defined as the fraction of drug removed from the blood during its passage through the liver. It is expressed as:\n$$ E_h = \\frac{C_a - C_v}{C_a} = 1 - \\frac{C_v}{C_a} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_v / C_a$:\n$$ E_h = 1 - \\frac{Q_h}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}} = \\frac{(Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}) - Q_h}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}} $$\nThis simplifies to the derived expression for $E_h$:\n$$ E_h = \\frac{f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}} $$\n\nHepatic clearance, $CL_h$, is defined as the volume of blood cleared of drug per unit time.

A solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to compute the AUC ratio $R = (F_{\\mathrm{ind}}/CL_{\\mathrm{sys,ind}}) / (F_{\\mathrm{base}}/CL_{\\mathrm{sys,base}})$ for several scenarios. This requires a systematic calculation of all intermediate pharmacokinetic parameters for a baseline (no induction) condition and an induced condition.\n\nLet us define a computational function, $\\Psi$, that takes the relevant parameters and returns the key outputs: oral bioavailability $F$ and systemic clearance $CL_{\\text{sys}}$.\n$\\Psi(CL_{\\mathrm{int},h}, CL_{\\mathrm{int},g}, Q_h, Q_g, f_u, f_{u,g}, F_a, CL_{\\mathrm{other}}) \\rightarrow (F, CL_{\\text{sys}})$.\n\nThe steps within this function are as follows:\n\n1.  **Calculate Hepatic Parameters:**\n    -   Hepatic availability: $F_h = \\dfrac{Q_h}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{int},h}}$.\n    -   Hepatic clearance: $CL_h = Q_h \\cdot \\dfrac{f_u \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{int},h}}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{int},h}} = Q_h \\cdot (1 - F_h)$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Intestinal Availability:**\n    -   $F_g = \\dfrac{Q_g}{Q_g + f_{u,g} \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{int},g}}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Systemic Clearance:**\n    -   $CL_{\\text{sys}} = CL_h + CL_{\\text{other}}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Oral Bioavailability:**\n    -   $F = F_a \\cdot F_g \\cdot F_h$.\n\nThe aformentioned process must be executed for both baseline and induced states.\n\n**Baseline State (base):**\nThe baseline condition corresponds to the absence of the inducer, rifampin. Thus, the effective concentrations $C_h$ and $C_g$ are zero.\n-   The induction fold-change in the liver is $I_{h}(0) = 1 + E_{\\max,h} \\cdot \\frac{0}{EC_{50,h} + 0} = 1$.\n-   The induction fold-change in the gut is $I_{g}(0) = 1 + E_{\\max,g} \\cdot \\frac{0}{EC_{50,g} + 0} = 1$.\n-   The baseline intrinsic clearances are:\n    $CL_{\\mathrm{int},h,\\mathrm{base}} = CL_{\\mathrm{int},h}^{\\mathrm{non3A}} + (1) \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{int},h}^{\\mathrm{3A}} = 150 + 1400 = 1550\\ \\mathrm{L/h}$.\n    $CL_{\\mathrm{int},g,\\mathrm{base}} = CL_{\\mathrm{int},g}^{\\mathrm{non3A}} + (1) \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{int},g}^{\\mathrm{3A}} = 0 + 25 = 25\\ \\mathrm{L/h}$.\n-   Using these values, we compute $(F_{\\mathrm{base}}, CL_{\\mathrm{sys,base}}) = \\Psi(CL_{\\mathrm{int},h,\\mathrm{base}}, CL_{\\mathrm{int},g,\\mathrm{base}}, ...)$.\n\n**Induced State (ind):**\nThe induced condition uses the specific non-zero concentrations $C_h$ and $C_g$ provided in each test case.\n-   The induction fold-changes are calculated:\n    $I_{h}(C_h) = 1 + E_{\\max,h} \\cdot \\dfrac{C_h}{EC_{50,h} + C_h}$.\n    $I_{g}(C_g) = 1 + E_{\\max,g} \\cdot \\dfrac{C_g}{EC_{50,g} + C_g}$.\n-   The induced intrinsic clearances are:\n    $CL_{\\mathrm{int},h,\\mathrm{ind}} = CL_{\\mathrm{int},h}^{\\mathrm{non3A}} + I_{h}(C_h) \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{int},h}^{\\mathrm{3A}}$.\n    $CL_{\\mathrm{int},g,\\mathrm{ind}} = CL_{\\mathrm{int},g}^{\\mathrm{non3A}} + I_{g}(C_g) \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{int},g}^{\\mathrm{3A}}$.\n-   Using these induced values, we compute $(F_{\\mathrm{ind}}, CL_{\\mathrm{sys,ind}}) = \\Psi(CL_{\\mathrm{int},h,\\mathrm{ind}}, CL_{\\mathrm{int},g,\\mathrm{ind}}, ...)$.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nThe ratio $R$ is then determined for each case:\n$R = \\dfrac{F_{\\mathrm{ind}} \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{sys,base}}}{F_{\\mathrm{base}} \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{sys,ind}}}$.\n\nThis procedure will be implemented computationally for each of the five test cases. The parameters for each case (including defaults and overrides) will be substituted into these general equations. For Case 4, the override sets $CL_{\\mathrm{int},h}^{\\mathrm{3A}} = 0$ and $CL_{\\mathrm{int},g}^{\\mathrm{3A}} = 0$. In this scenario, $CL_{\\mathrm{int},h,\\mathrm{ind}} = CL_{\\mathrm{int},h,\\mathrm{base}}$ and $CL_{\\mathrm{int},g,\\mathrm{ind}} = CL_{\\mathrm{int},g,\\mathrm{base}}$, which logically must yield $R=1$. For Case 5, with very large $C_h$ and $C_g$, the term $\\frac{C_x}{EC_{50,x} + C_x}$ approaches $1$, leading to $I_x \\approx 1 + E_{\\max,x}$. The computational implementation will follow this structured, principle-based approach.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the change in AUC for a CYP3A substrate co-administered with rifampin,\n    using a PBPK framework.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Default Substrate and Physiological Parameters ---\n    default_params = {\n        'Q_h': 90.0,         # Hepatic blood flow (L/h)\n        'Q_g': 18.0,         # Small intestinal effective blood flow (L/h)\n        'f_u': 0.03,         # Fraction unbound in plasma (unitless)\n        'f_u_g': 1.0,        # Unbound fraction in enterocytes (unitless)\n        'F_a': 1.0,          # Fraction absorbed (unitless)\n        'CL_other': 3.0,     # Nonhepatic systemic clearance (L/h)\n        'CL_int_h_3A': 1400.0, # Hepatic intrinsic clearance, CYP3A component (L/h)\n        'CL_int_h_non3A': 150.0, # Hepatic intrinsic clearance, non-CYP3A (L/h)\n        'CL_int_g_3A': 25.0,  # Intestinal intrinsic clearance, CYP3A component (L/h)\n        'CL_int_g_non3A': 0.0  # Intestinal intrinsic clearance, non-CYP3A (L/h)\n    }\n\n    # --- Test Cases ---\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: Typical induction\n        {\n            'E_max_h': 6.0, 'EC50_h': 0.2, 'C_h': 2.0,\n            'E_max_g': 8.0, 'EC50_g': 0.1, 'C_g': 2.0\n        },\n        # Case 2: Low rifampin concentrations\n        {\n            'E_max_h': 6.0, 'EC50_h': 0.2, 'C_h': 0.05,\n            'E_max_g': 8.0, 'EC50_g': 0.1, 'C_g': 0.05\n        },\n        # Case 3: Greater intestinal induction\n        {\n            'E_max_h': 3.0, 'EC50_h': 0.3, 'C_h': 2.0,\n            'E_max_g': 12.0, 'EC50_g': 0.1, 'C_g': 2.0\n        },\n        # Case 4: No CYP3A contribution (control)\n        {\n            'CL_int_h_3A': 0.0, 'CL_int_g_3A': 0.0, # Overrides\n            'E_max_h': 6.0, 'EC50_h': 0.2, 'C_h': 2.0,\n            'E_max_g': 8.0, 'EC50_g': 0.1, 'C_g': 2.0\n        },\n        # Case 5: Saturating induction\n        {\n            'E_max_h': 6.0, 'EC50_h': 0.2, 'C_h': 1000.0,\n            'E_max_g': 10.0, 'EC50_g': 0.1, 'C_g': 1000.0\n        }\n    ]\n\n    def calculate_pk_outputs(p, C_h_eff, C_g_eff, induction_params):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates F and CL_sys for a given state (baseline or induced).\n        \n        Args:\n            p (dict): Dictionary of substrate and physiological parameters.\n            C_h_eff (float): Effective rifampin concentration in hepatocytes.\n            C_g_eff (float): Effective rifampin concentration in enterocytes.\n            induction_params (dict): Emax, EC50 parameters for the current test case.\n            \n        Returns:\n            tuple: (F, CL_sys)\n        \"\"\"\n        # Calculate induction fold-change\n        # Handle division by zero for EC50, although not expected with valid inputs\n        ec50_h = induction_params.get('EC50_h', 0.2)\n        ec50_g = induction_params.get('EC50_g', 0.1)\n        \n        I_h = 1.0 + induction_params.get('E_max_h', 0.0) * (C_h_eff / (ec50_h + C_h_eff))\n        I_g = 1.0 + induction_params.get('E_max_g', 0.0) * (C_g_eff / (ec50_g + C_g_eff))\n        \n        # Calculate total intrinsic clearances\n        CL_int_h = p['CL_int_h_non3A'] + I_h * p['CL_int_h_3A']\n        CL_int_g = p['CL_int_g_non3A'] + I_g * p['CL_int_g_3A']\n\n        # Hepatic parameters (well-stirred model)\n        F_h = p['Q_h'] / (p['Q_h'] + p['f_u'] * CL_int_h)\n        CL_h = p['Q_h'] * (1.0 - F_h)\n        \n        # Intestinal availability (well-stirred model)\n        F_g = p['Q_g'] / (p['Q_g'] + p['f_u_g'] * CL_int_g)\n        \n        # Systemic clearance\n        CL_sys = CL_h + p['CL_other']\n        \n        # Oral bioavailability\n        F = p['F_a'] * F_g * F_h\n        \n        return F, CL_sys\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case_params in test_cases:\n        # Create a combined parameter set for the current case\n        current_params = default_params.copy()\n        current_params.update(case_params)\n\n        # 1.
