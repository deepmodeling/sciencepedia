The rate constants for the forward and reverse reactions of the first step are $k_f$ and $k_r$, respectively. The rate constant for the catalytic step is $k_{cat}$.\n\nThe problem states that the cofactor is non-limiting, which means it can be treated as a constant and its concentration is incorporated into the apparent kinetic parameters. It also states that product inhibition is negligible, justifying the omission of a reverse reaction from $E+P$.\n\nUnder the steady-state assumption, the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex, $[ES]$, is constant, which means its rate of formation equals its rate of breakdown:\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_f[E][S] - (k_r + k_{cat})[ES] = 0 $$\nThe total enzyme concentration, $[E]_T$, is the sum of the free enzyme, $[E]$, and the complexed enzyme, $[ES]$:\n$$ [E]_T = [E] + [ES] $$\nSubstituting $[E] = [E]_T - [ES]$ into the steady-state equation gives:\n$$ k_f([E]_T - [ES])[S] = (k_r + k_{cat})[ES] $$\nSolving for $[ES]$:\n$$ k_f[E]_T[S] - k_f[ES][S] = (k_r + k_{cat})[ES] $$\n$$ k_f[E]_T[S] = (k_r + k_{cat} + k_f[S])[ES] $$\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{k_f[E]_T[S]}{k_r + k_{cat} + k_f[S]} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $k_f$:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{[E]_T[S]}{\\frac{k_r + k_{cat}}{k_f} + [S]} $$\nThe initial rate of reaction, $v_0$, is the rate of product formation:\n$$ v_0 = k_{cat}[ES] $$\nSubstituting the expression for $[ES]$:\n$$ v_0 = k_{cat} \\frac{[E]_T[S]}{\\frac{k_r + k_{cat}}{k_f} + [S]} $$\nWe define the Michaelis constant $K_m = \\frac{k_r + k_{cat}}{k_f}$ and the maximum velocity $V_{\\max} = k_{cat}[E]_T$.

In this case, the denominator $K_m + [S] \\approx K_m$. The rate equation simplifies to:\n    $$ v_0 \\approx \\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_m}[S] $$\n    The rate is approximately first-order with respect to the substrate concentration. The reaction velocity is sensitive to both the substrate concentration $[S]$ and the enzyme's affinity for the substrate (where a lower $K_m$ indicates higher affinity). The enzyme is far from saturation.\n\n2.  **Capacity-Limited Regime:** This occurs when $[S] \\gg K_m$. In this case, the denominator $K_m + [S] \\approx [S]$. The rate equation simplifies to:\n    $$ v_0 \\approx \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{[S]} = V_{\\max} $$\n    The rate is approximately zero-order with respect to the substrate concentration and has reached its maximum, $V_{\\max}$. The reaction is limited by the enzyme's total catalytic capacity (i.e., the amount of enzyme and its turnover rate $k_{cat}$), not by the availability or binding of the substrate.

The enzyme is far from being saturated. We can quantify the fractional saturation (the fraction of enzyme active sites occupied) as:\n$$ \\frac{v_0}{V_{\\max}} = \\frac{[S]}{K_m + [S]} = \\frac{30}{150 + 30} = \\frac{30}{180} = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.167 $$\nThis shows that the reaction is proceeding at only about $16.7\\%$ of its maximum possible rate.
