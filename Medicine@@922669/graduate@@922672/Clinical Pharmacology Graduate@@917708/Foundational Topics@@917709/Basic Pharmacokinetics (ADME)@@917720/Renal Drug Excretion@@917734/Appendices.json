This exercise explores the critical concept of ion trapping, where the pH of the urine determines the ionization state of a drug and, consequently, its ability to passively diffuse across tubular membranes. By working through this problem, you will apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch principle to predict whether a common weak acid drug, ibuprofen, is likely to be excreted or reabsorbed based on urine pH [@problem_id:4588375].", "problem": "A monoprotic weak acid present as $HA$ (unionized) and its conjugate base $A^{-}$ (ionized) is subject to renal handling in the distal nephron by passive transcellular diffusion that is dominated by the unionized species. Consider ibuprofen, a monoprotic weak acid with $pK_{a} = 4.9$, in urine at $pH = 6.5$.

The value $f_{\\text{unionized}} \\approx 0.02450$ means that at a urine $pH$ of $6.5$, only about $2.45\\%$ of the total ibuprofen in the tubular fluid is in its unionized, lipophilic form ($HA$). The vast majority, approximately $97.55\\%$, exists as the ionized conjugate base ($A^{-}$). According to the problem's assumption, passive transcellular reabsorption is dominated by the unionized species. Since this fraction is very small, passive reabsorption of ibuprofen from the renal tubule is likely to be minimal. The drug is effectively \"trapped\" in its ionized, less lipophilic form within the alkaline urine, a phenomenon known as ion trapping, which promotes its renal excretion.
