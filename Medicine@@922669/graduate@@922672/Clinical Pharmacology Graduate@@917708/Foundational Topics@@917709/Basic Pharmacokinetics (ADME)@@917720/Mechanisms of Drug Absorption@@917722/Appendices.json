Fick's first law defines the flux at any position $x$ as:\n$$J(x) = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$$\n2. The steady-state condition asserts that the flux $J$ is constant for all $x$ within the membrane, i.e., $J(x) = J$.\n\nCombining these, we have a first-order ordinary differential equation for the concentration profile $C(x)$:\n$$J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$$\nWe can solve this equation for $C(x)$ by separation of variables. Let the apical side be at position $x=0$ and the basolateral side be at $x=h$. The boundary conditions are $C(x=0) = C_{0}$ and $C(x=h) = C_{i}$.\n$$dC = -\\frac{J}{D} dx$$\nWe integrate both sides of this equation across the membrane, from $x=0$ to $x=h$:\n$$\\int_{C(0)}^{C(h)} dC = \\int_{0}^{h} -\\frac{J}{D} dx$$\nSince $J$ and $D$ are constants, the right-hand side integral is straightforward:\n$$C(h) - C(0) = -\\frac{J}{D} [x]_{0}^{h}$$\nSubstituting the boundary conditions:\n$$C_{i} - C_{0} = -\\frac{J}{D} (h - 0)$$\n$$C_{i} - C_{0} = -\\frac{Jh}{D}$$\nWe now rearrange this equation to solve for the steady-state flux, $J$:\n$$J = -\\frac{D(C_{i} - C_{0})}{h}$$\n$$J = \\frac{D(C_{0} - C_{i})}{h}$$\nThis is the required expression for the steady-state flux. It shows that flux is driven by the concentration difference $(C_{0} - C_{i})$ and is inversely proportional to the membrane thickness $h$.\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Evaluation of the Flux\n\nFirst, we must convert the given concentrations from micromolar ($\\mu$M) to the standard SI unit of mol m$^{-3}$.\nGiven: $1$ M $= 1000$ mol m$^{-3}$.\nThe apical concentration is $C_{0} = 76$ $\\mu$M $= 76 \\times 10^{-6}$ M.\n$$C_{0} = (76 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mol L}^{-1}) \\times (1000 \\text{ L m}^{-3}) = 76 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mol m}^{-3} = 0.076 \\text{ mol m}^{-3}$$\nThe intracellular concentration is $C_{i} = 4$ $\\mu$M $= 4 \\times 10^{-6}$ M.\n$$C_{i} = (4 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mol L}^{-1}) \\times (1000 \\text{ L m}^{-3}) = 4 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mol m}^{-3} = 0.004 \\text{ mol m}^{-3}$$\nThe concentration difference is:\n$$C_{0} - C_{i} = 0.076 - 0.004 = 0.072 \\text{ mol m}^{-3}$$\nNow, we substitute the parameters into the derived flux expression:\n$$J = \\frac{D(C_{0} - C_{i})}{h} = \\frac{(1.2 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}^{2} \\text{ s}^{-1}) (0.072 \\text{ mol m}^{-3})}{8.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}}$$\n$$J = \\frac{1.2 \\times 0.072}{8.0} \\times \\frac{10^{-10}}{10^{-6}} \\text{ mol m}^{-2} \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\n$$J = \\frac{0.0864}{8.0} \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ mol m}^{-2} \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\n$$J = 0.0108 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ mol m}^{-2} \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\n$$J = 1.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mol m}^{-2} \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$J = 1.080 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mol m}^{-2} \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\n\n### Part 3: Computation and Interpretation of Elasticities\n\nThe elasticity of flux $J$ with respect to a parameter $p$ is defined as $E_{p} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln J}{\\partial \\ln p}$. This definition is particularly useful for functions that have a power-law form. Our flux expression is $J = (C_{0}-C_{i}) D^{1} h^{-1}$.\n\nTo compute the elasticities, we first take the natural logarithm of the flux expression:\n$$\\ln J = \\ln\\left(\\frac{D(C_{0} - C_{i})}{h}\\right) = \\ln(D) + \\ln(C_{0} - C_{i}) - \\ln(h)$$\n\n**Elasticity with respect to the diffusion coefficient, $E_{D}$:**\n$$E_{D} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln J}{\\partial \\ln D} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln D} \\left[ \\ln(D) + \\ln(C_{0} - C_{i}) - \\ln(h) \\right]$$\nThe terms $\\ln(C_{0} - C_{i})$ and $\\ln(h)$ are treated as constants with respect to the differentiation variable $\\ln(D)$. Therefore:\n$$E_{D} = \\frac{\\partial(\\ln D)}{\\partial(\\ln D)} + 0 - 0 = 1$$\nSo, $E_{D} = 1$.\n\n**Elasticity with respect to the membrane thickness, $E_{h}$:**\n$$E_{h} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln J}{\\partial \\ln h} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln h} \\left[ \\ln(D) + \\ln(C_{0} - C_{i}) - \\ln(h) \\right]$$\nThe terms $\\ln(D)$ and $\\ln(C_{0} - C_{i})$ are constants with respect to $\\ln(h)$. Therefore:\n$$E_{h} = 0 + 0 - \\frac{\\partial(\\ln h)}{\\partial(\\ln h)} = -1$$\nSo, $E_{h} = -1$.\n\n**Physical Meaning:**\nThe elasticity coefficient $E_{p}$ quantifies the fractional change in the flux $J$ resulting from a small fractional change in a parameter $p$, i.e., $E_{p} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta J / J}{\\Delta p / p}$. It measures the sensitivity of the flux to that parameter.\n- The value $E_{D} = 1$ indicates that the flux $J$ is directly and linearly proportional to the diffusion coefficient $D$. A $1\\%$ increase in $D$ will lead to a $1\\%$ increase in $J$. This is physically intuitive: faster diffusion at the molecular level naturally results in a proportionally higher macroscopic flux.\n- The value $E_{h} = -1$ indicates that the flux $J$ is inversely proportional to the membrane thickness $h$. A $1\\%$ increase in $h$ will lead to a $1\\%$ decrease in $J$. This is also physically intuitive: a thicker membrane represents a longer diffusion path and thus a greater barrier to transport, which reduces the flux for a given concentration difference.\n\nThe final report requires a row vector $[J, E_{D}, E_{h}]$.\n- $J \\approx 1.080 \\times 10^{-6}$ mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$\n- $E_{D} = 1$ (dimensionless)\n- $E_{h} = -1$ (dimensionless)\nThe resulting vector is $[1.080 \\times 10^{-6}, 1, -1]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.080 \\times 10^{-6} & 1 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4565526"}, {"introduction": "While Fick's law describes the physics of diffusion, the chemical nature of the drug adds a crucial layer of complexity, as most drugs are weak acids or bases.

Unlike passive diffusion, transporter-mediated flux is saturable. As the donor concentration increases, the fixed-capacity active transport component ($V_{\\text{max}}$) will become a smaller fraction of the total flux.
