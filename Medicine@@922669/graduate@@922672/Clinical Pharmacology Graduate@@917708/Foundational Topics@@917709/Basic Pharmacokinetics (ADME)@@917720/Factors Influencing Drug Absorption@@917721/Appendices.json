According to the principles of passive transcellular diffusion (the pH-partition hypothesis), the primary driving force for the absorption of a drug across a biological lipid membrane, such as the intestinal epithelium, is the concentration gradient of its uncharged, non-polar form. The uncharged form ($\\mathrm{B}$) is significantly more lipid-soluble (lipophilic) than its charged, polar counterpart ($\\mathrm{BH^+}$) and thus permeates the cell membrane much more readily.\nThe calculated fraction of the unprotonated (unionized) form is $f_u \\approx 0.009901$, which corresponds to approximately $0.99\\%$. This means that at the $pH$ of the jejunum ($6.5$), more than $99\\%$ of the weak base drug exists in its protonated, ionized form ($\\mathrm{BH^+}$), which is poorly absorbed. Less than $1\\%$ of the total drug concentration is in the absorbable, unionized form ($\\mathrm{B}$).\nConsequently, the concentration gradient of the absorbable species across the jejunal mucosa is very small. This low value of $f_u$ implies a significantly reduced driving force for passive transcellular absorption for this weak base in the jejunum. The drug's absorption in this segment of the intestine is expected to be slow and inefficient. Better absorption would be expected in a more alkaline environment, such as the ileum or colon, where the $pH$ is higher and closer to the drug's $pK_a$, leading to a larger fraction of the unionized form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.009901}$$", "id": "4554849"}, {"introduction": "Before a drug can be absorbed, it must first dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluids.

Your interpretation does not need to be quantified.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and computation of the absolute oral bioavailability, $F$, and a subsequent interpretation of the factors limiting it. The solution proceeds in two parts.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for absolute oral bioavailability, $F$, from first principles. Systemic clearance, $CL$, is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of a drug per unit time. Under conditions of linear pharmacokinetics, it can be calculated as the ratio of the total amount of drug that reaches the systemic circulation to the total systemic drug exposure, measured as the area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time zero to infinity ($AUC$).\n\nFor a single intravenous ($iv$) dose, $D_{iv}$, the entire dose is administered directly into the systemic circulation. Thus, the clearance is given by the equation:\n$$CL = \\frac{D_{iv}}{AUC_{iv}}$$\n\nFor a single oral ($po$) dose, $D_{po}$, only a fraction, $F$, of the administered dose reaches the systemic circulation due to incomplete absorption and/or first-pass metabolism. This fraction $F$ is the absolute oral bioavailability. The total amount of drug reaching the systemic circulation is therefore $F \\cdot D_{po}$. The clearance for the oral route is expressed as:\n$$CL = \\frac{F \\cdot D_{po}}{AUC_{po}}$$\n\nThe problem states that systemic clearance is identical across routes of administration. This allows us to equate the two expressions for $CL$:\n$$\\frac{D_{iv}}{AUC_{iv}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D_{po}}{AUC_{po}}$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the absolute bioavailability, $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{D_{iv}}{D_{po}} \\cdot \\frac{AUC_{po}}{AUC_{iv}}$$\n\nThe problem provides the following data: $D_{po} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, $D_{iv} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, $AUC_{po} = 1.12\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h \\cdot L^{-1}}$, and $AUC_{iv} = 3.20\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h \\cdot L^{-1}}$. Substituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$F = \\frac{100}{100} \\cdot \\frac{1.12}{3.20}$$\nThe dose terms cancel out, simplifying the calculation to the ratio of the AUC values:\n$$F = \\frac{1.12}{3.20} = 0.35$$\nAs per the instruction to round to three significant figures, the absolute oral bioavailability is $F = 0.350$.\n\nSecond, we interpret this result based on the fecal recovery data. Absolute bioavailability ($F$) is the product of the fraction of the dose absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, $F_a$, and the fraction of the absorbed drug that escapes first-pass elimination in the gut wall and liver, which we can denote as $F_{FP}$. Thus, $F = F_a \\cdot F_{FP}$.\n\nThe problem states that the fraction of the oral dose recovered unchanged in the feces, $f_{fe}$, is $0.06$. This value represents the portion of the administered oral dose that was not absorbed across the intestinal epithelium. Assuming that degradation of the drug in the GI lumen is negligible, the unabsorbed fraction is $1 - F_a$. Therefore:\n$$f_{fe} = 1 - F_a = 0.06$$\nFrom this, we can determine the fraction of the dose that was absorbed:\n$$F_a = 1 - 0.06 = 0.94$$\nThis indicates that absorption from the GI tract is very high, at approximately $94\\%$. Since $F_a$ is close to $1$, poor absorption is not the primary factor limiting the drug's overall bioavailability.\n\nThe significant difference between the fraction absorbed ($F_a \\approx 0.94$) and the overall bioavailability ($F = 0.350$) must be due to extensive first-pass extraction. We can estimate the fraction escaping first-pass metabolism, $F_{FP}$, using the relationship $F = F_a \\cdot F_{FP}$:\n$$0.350 = 0.94 \\cdot F_{FP}$$\nSolving for $F_{FP}$:\n$$F_{FP} = \\frac{0.350}{0.94} \\approx 0.372$$\nThis result suggests that only about $37.2\\%$ of the drug that is absorbed from the GI tract successfully reaches the systemic circulation, while the majority (approximately $1 - 0.372 = 0.628$, or $62.8\\%$) is eliminated by the gut wall and/or liver before it can be distributed systemically.\n\nIn conclusion, the computation shows that the absolute oral bioavailability is $F=0.350$. Based on the provided fecal recovery data, which indicates that absorption is nearly complete ($F_a \\approx 0.94$), it is most plausible that the low bioavailability is limited by extensive first-pass extraction, not by poor gastrointestinal absorption across the intestinal epithelium.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.350}$$", "id": "4554862"}]}
