The data and requested calculations are standard for a single-dose intravenous (IV) bolus study.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine the total body clearance ($Cl$) of a drug. This requires first calculating the total area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time zero to infinity, denoted $AUC_{0-\\infty}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the definition of $AUC_{0-\\infty}$. It is the time integral of the drug's plasma concentration, $C(t)$, from time $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$:\n$$AUC_{0-\\infty} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t) \\,dt$$\nThe problem provides the area under the curve up to the last quantifiable sample time, $t_{last} = 10$ hours, which is denoted $AUC_{0-t}$. To be more specific, we will denote it as $AUC_{0-t_{last}}$. The total $AUC$ can be decomposed into two parts: the portion from time $0$ to $t_{last}$, and the extrapolated portion from $t_{last}$ to infinity.\n$$AUC_{0-\\infty} = \\int_{0}^{t_{last}} C(t) \\,dt + \\int_{t_{last}}^{\\infty} C(t) \\,dt$$\nThe first term corresponds to the value calculated from the experimental data, which is given as $AUC_{0-t_{last}}$. The second term, representing the \"tail\" of the curve, is the extrapolated area, which we can call $AUC_{t_{last}-\\infty}$.\n$$AUC_{0-\\infty} = AUC_{0-t_{last}} + AUC_{t_{last}-\\infty}$$\nThe problem states that the terminal phase is characterized by a first-order elimination process with a rate constant $\\lambda_z$. This implies that for times $t \\ge t_{last}$, the concentration-time profile can be described by the mono-exponential decay function:\n$$C(t) = C_{last} \\exp(-\\lambda_z (t - t_{last}))$$\nHere, we use the last measured concentration, $C_{last}$, as the starting point for the extrapolation at $t=t_{last}$.\n\nThe extrapolated area $AUC_{t_{last}-\\infty}$ can now be calculated by integrating this function from $t_{last}$ to $\\infty$:\n$$AUC_{t_{last}-\\infty} = \\int_{t_{last}}^{\\infty} C_{last} \\exp(-\\lambda_z (t - t_{last})) \\,dt$$\nTo solve this integral, we can perform a substitution. Let $u = t - t_{last}$. Then $du = dt$. The limits of integration change as follows: when $t = t_{last}$, $u = 0$; as $t \\to \\infty$, $u \\to \\infty$. The integral becomes:\n$$AUC_{t_{last}-\\infty} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C_{last} \\exp(-\\lambda_z u) \\,du$$\n$$AUC_{t_{last}-\\infty} = C_{last} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\lambda_z} \\exp(-\\lambda_z u) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}$$\nEvaluating the definite integral at its limits:\n$$AUC_{t_{last}-\\infty} = C_{last} \\left( \\lim_{u \\to \\infty} \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda_z} \\exp(-\\lambda_z u)\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda_z} \\exp(-\\lambda_z \\cdot 0)\\right) \\right)$$\n$$AUC_{t_{last}-\\infty} = C_{last} \\left( 0 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda_z} \\cdot 1\\right) \\right) = \\frac{C_{last}}{\\lambda_z}$$\nThis completes the derivation for the correction of the truncated $AUC$. The total $AUC_{0-\\infty}$ is thus given by:\n$$AUC_{0-\\infty} = AUC_{0-t_{last}} + \\frac{C_{last}}{\\lambda_z}$$\nNext, we determine the total body clearance, $Cl$. By definition, clearance is the volume of plasma cleared of drug per unit time. It relates the rate of drug elimination from the body, $\\frac{dX_e}{dt}$, to the plasma concentration $C(t)$:\n$$\\frac{dX_e}{dt} = Cl \\cdot C(t)$$\nAssuming clearance is constant (a feature of linear pharmacokinetics), the total amount of drug eliminated from the body from $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$ is equal to the bioavailable dose, $F \\times Dose$. This total amount can also be expressed as the time integral of the rate of elimination:\n$$F \\times Dose = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{dX_e}{dt} \\,dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} Cl \\cdot C(t) \\,dt$$\nSince $Cl$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$F \\times Dose = Cl \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t) \\,dt = Cl \\cdot AUC_{0-\\infty}$$\nFor an intravenous (IV) bolus injection, the entire dose reaches the systemic circulation, so the bioavailability, $F$, is $1$. The relationship simplifies to:\n$$Dose = Cl \\cdot AUC_{0-\\infty}$$\nSolving for clearance, we get:\n$$Cl = \\frac{Dose}{AUC_{0-\\infty}}$$\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values provided in the problem.\nThe givens are:\n$Dose = 150$ mg\n$AUC_{0-t} = 220$ mg·h/L (where $t = 10$ h)\n$C_{last} = 1.8$ mg/L (at $t_{last} = 10$ h)\n$\\lambda_z = 0.17$ h$^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total $AUC_{0-\\infty}$:\n$$AUC_{0-\\infty} = 220 \\, \\text{mg·h/L} + \\frac{1.8 \\, \\text{mg/L}}{0.17 \\, \\text{h}^{-1}}$$\n$$AUC_{0-\\infty} \\approx 220 + 10.588235... \\, \\text{mg·h/L}$$\n$$AUC_{0-\\infty} \\approx 230.588235... \\, \\text{mg·h/L}$$\nNow, we can calculate the clearance $Cl$:\n$$Cl = \\frac{150 \\, \\text{mg}}{230.588235... \\, \\text{mg·h/L}}$$\n$$Cl \\approx 0.650519... \\, \\text{L/h}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

Let $Q_H$ be the hepatic blood flow rate. At steady state, the rate of drug mass entering the liver must equal the sum of the rate of drug mass leaving the liver and the rate of drug elimination within the liver.\n\nThe rate of drug entry into the liver is given by the product of blood flow and inflow concentration:\n$$ \\text{Rate In} = Q_H C_{\\text{in}} $$\n\nThe rate of drug exit from the liver via the bloodstream is:\n$$ \\text{Rate Out} = Q_H C_{\\text{out}} $$\n\nThe rate of elimination, $v_E$, is the difference between the rate of entry and the rate of exit:\n$$ v_E = \\text{Rate In} - \\text{Rate Out} = Q_H (C_{\\text{in}} - C_{\\text{out}}) $$\n\nThe problem states that elimination occurs via hepatic metabolism and that only the unbound fraction of the drug is available to the enzymes.

The language is objective and the data are consistent.\n\nThe problem states that drug elimination is governed by a single, saturable, enzyme-mediated pathway. The reference to the canonical mass-action mechanism and the validity of the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) directly implies that the rate of elimination, which we denote as $v$, follows the Michaelis-Menten equation. In this context, the drug at plasma concentration $C$ serves as the substrate for the enzyme. The elimination rate $v$ (in mass per unit time, e.g., $\\mathrm{mg/h}$) is thus given by:\n$$v(C) = \\frac{V_{max} \\cdot C}{K_m + C}$$\nwhere $V_{max}$ is the maximum elimination rate and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant, which is the concentration at which the elimination rate is half of $V_{max}$.\n\nThe problem provides a formal definition for the instantaneous systemic clearance, $Cl$, as the elimination rate at a given instant divided by the contemporaneous plasma concentration $C$. We can write this definition as:\n$$Cl(C) = \\frac{v(C)}{C}$$\n\nThe first task is to establish the expression for the instantaneous clearance as a function of concentration $C$.

As $C$ increases, the denominator $(K_m + C)$ increases, and consequently, the clearance $Cl(C)$ decreases. This concentration-dependent clearance is the defining characteristic of nonlinear pharmacokinetics.\n\nThe second task is to compute the clearance at two specific concentrations using the provided values: $V_{max} = 100~\\mathrm{mg/h}$ and $K_m = 5~\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n\nCase 1: $C = 1~\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\nThis concentration is below the $K_m$ value.
