This exercise delves into the classical binomial model of synaptic transmission, providing a quantitative framework to understand how synaptic strength is determined by the number of release sites ($N$), the probability of release ($p$), and the size of a single quantum ($q$). By analyzing simulated electrophysiological data, you will practice estimating these core parameters, gaining a deeper appreciation for the stochastic and modular nature of neural communication [@problem_id:4731575].", "problem": "A layer 2/3 cortical pyramidal neuron is recorded in whole-cell voltage clamp at a holding potential of $-70\\,\\text{mV}$.

The experimental parameters and measured values are within a physiologically realistic range for a cortical synapse. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient data ($3$ measurements: mean, variance, failure rate) to estimate the $3$ model parameters ($N$, $p$, $q$). The language is objective and precise. The problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is determined to be **valid**. A full solution is warranted.\n\n**Derivation of Model Equations**\n\nWe model the synaptic response based on the provided binomial framework. Let $k$ be the number of quanta released in a single trial. Since there are $N$ independent release sites, each with a release probability $p$, the random variable $k$ follows a binomial distribution, $k \\sim B(N,p)$. The probability of observing exactly $k$ releases is given by:\n$$P(k) = \\binom{N}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N-k}$$\nThe total measured current in a trial, $I$, is the sum of the synaptic current, $I_{syn} = kq$, and the additive baseline noise, $I_{noise}$.\n$$I = I_{syn} + I_{noise} = kq + I_{noise}$$\nWe assume the noise has zero mean, $E[I_{noise}] = 0$, and a variance of $\\sigma^2_{noise}$. The synaptic current and noise are assumed to be independent.\n\n1.  **Mean Evoked EPSC Amplitude ($\\mu_{EPSC}$)**:\n    By linearity of expectation, the mean of the total measured current is:\n    $$\\mu_{EPSC} = E[I] = E[kq + I_{noise}] = E[kq] + E[I_{noise}]$$\n    Since $q$ is a constant and $E[I_{noise}] = 0$:\n    $$\\mu_{EPSC} = q E[k]$$\n    The mean of a binomial distribution $B(N,p)$ is $E[k] = Np$. Therefore, the mean evoked amplitude is:\n    $$\\mu_{EPSC} = Npq$$\n\n2.  **Failure Fraction ($f_0$)**:\n    A failure is an event where zero quanta are released ($k=0$). The probability of a failure, $P_0$, is given by the binomial probability for $k=0$:\n    $$P_0 = P(k=0) = \\binom{N}{0} p^0 (1-p)^{N-0} = (1-p)^N$$\n    The failure fraction, $f_0$, is the experimental estimate of this probability.\n\n3.  **Variance of Evoked EPSC Amplitude ($\\sigma^2_{EPSC}$)**:\n    Since the synaptic current and the noise are independent, their variances add:\n    $$\\sigma^2_{EPSC} = \\text{Var}(I) = \\text{Var}(kq + I_{noise}) = \\text{Var}(kq) + \\text{Var}(I_{noise})$$\n    The variance of the synaptic current is $\\text{Var}(kq) = q^2 \\text{Var}(k)$. The variance of a binomial distribution $B(N,p)$ is $\\text{Var}(k) = Np(1-p)$. The noise variance is given as $\\sigma^2_{noise}$. Thus, the total measured variance is:\n    $$\\sigma^2_{EPSC} = q^2 Np(1-p) + \\sigma^2_{noise}$$\n    This expression relates the total measured variance to the model parameters. The variance arising purely from the synaptic release process is $\\sigma^2_{syn} = \\sigma^2_{EPSC} - \\sigma^2_{noise} = q^2 Np(1-p)$.\n\n**Estimation of Model Parameters ($N$, $p$, $q$)**\n\nWe use the provided experimental data to solve for the parameters $N$, $p$, and $q$.\n- The number of trials is $M = 160$, and the number of failures is $n_{fail} = 10$. The failure fraction is $f_0 = \\frac{n_{fail}}{M} = \\frac{10}{160} = \\frac{1}{16} = 0.0625$.\n- The mean EPSC is $\\mu_{EPSC} = 20\\,\\text{pA}$.\n- The total EPSC variance is $\\sigma^2_{EPSC} = 104\\,\\text{pA}^2$.\n- The noise variance is $\\sigma^2_{noise} = 4\\,\\text{pA}^2$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the variance of the synaptic component of the response by subtracting the noise variance:\n$$\\sigma^2_{syn} = \\sigma^2_{EPSC} - \\sigma^2_{noise} = 104 - 4 = 100\\,\\text{pA}^2$$\nNow we have a system of three equations with our data:\n(i) $20 = Npq$\n(ii) $0.0625 = (1-p)^N$\n(iii) $100 = q^2 Np(1-p)$\n\nTo solve this system, we can use the coefficient of variation (CV) of the synaptic current. The squared CV is:\n$$CV_{syn}^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2_{syn}}{(\\mu_{EPSC})^2} = \\frac{100}{20^2} = \\frac{100}{400} = 0.25$$\nWe can also express $CV_{syn}^2$ in terms of the model parameters:\n$$CV_{syn}^2 = \\frac{q^2 Np(1-p)}{(Npq)^2} = \\frac{1-p}{Np}$$\nEquating these gives a relationship between $N$ and $p$:\n$$\\frac{1-p}{Np} = 0.25 \\implies 1-p = 0.25 Np \\implies 1 = p(1+0.25N) \\implies p = \\frac{1}{1+0.25N} = \\frac{4}{N+4}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $p$ into the failure equation (ii):\n$$0.0625 = (1-p)^N = \\left(1 - \\frac{4}{N+4}\\right)^N = \\left(\\frac{N+4-4}{N+4}\\right)^N = \\left(\\frac{N}{N+4}\\right)^N$$\nWe need to solve the equation $0.0625 = (\\frac{N}{N+4})^N$ for $N$. We can test integer values for $N$, which is a discrete quantity:\n- If $N=1$: $(\\frac{1}{5})^1 = 0.2$\n- If $N=2$: $(\\frac{2}{6})^2 = (\\frac{1}{3})^2 \\approx 0.111$\n- If $N=3$: $(\\frac{3}{7})^3 \\approx 0.0787$\n- If $N=4$: $(\\frac{4}{8})^4 = (\\frac{1}{2})^4 = \\frac{1}{16} = 0.0625$\nThe equation holds exactly for $N=4$. Thus, the estimated number of release sites is $N=4$.\n\nWith $N=4$, we can find the release probability $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{4}{N+4} = \\frac{4}{4+4} = \\frac{4}{8} = 0.5$$\nFinally, we find the quantal size $q$ using the mean equation (i):\n$$q = \\frac{\\mu_{EPSC}}{Np} = \\frac{20}{4 \\times 0.5} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\\,\\text{pA}$$\nThe estimated parameters are $N=4$, $p=0.5$, and $q=10\\,\\text{pA}$.\n\n**Assessment of Model Consistency**\n\nThe problem asks to use the variance data to assess model consistency. The variance data was central to our estimation of $N$ and $p$ via the coefficient of variation. The consistency of the model can be assessed in two ways.\n\n1.  **Internal Consistency**: The derived parameters ($N=4$, $p=0.5$, $q=10$) must be able to reproduce all the initial measurements.\n    - Mean: $\\mu_{EPSC} = Npq = 4 \\times 0.5 \\times 10 = 20\\,\\text{pA}$. (Matches)\n    - Failure Fraction: $f_0 = (1-p)^N = (1-0.5)^4 = (0.5)^4 = 0.0625$. (Matches)\n    - Total Variance: $\\sigma^2_{EPSC} = q^2 Np(1-p) + \\sigma^2_{noise} = 10^2 \\times 4 \\times 0.5 \\times (1-0.5) + 4 = 100 \\times 1 + 4 = 104\\,\\text{pA}^2$. (Matches)\n    The fact that an integer solution for $N$ exists that perfectly satisfies the equations for the mean, variance, and failure rate indicates that the data are internally consistent with the simple binomial model.\n\n2.  **External Consistency**: The model's predictions can be compared with independent measurements. The problem provides that asynchronous quantal events, measured in a separate strontium-substitution experiment, have a mean amplitude of $q_{async} = 10\\,\\text{pA}$. This experiment provides a direct and independent measurement of the quantal size $q$. Our estimate, derived from the statistics of synchronous release, is $q=10\\,\\text{pA}$. The perfect agreement between the indirectly estimated $q$ and the directly measured $q_{async}$ provides strong evidence supporting the validity of the binomial model for this synapse under the given assumptions.\n\nIn summary, the binomial model is highly consistent with all available measurements. The estimated parameters are $N=4$ release sites, a release probability $p=0.5$, and a quantal size $q=10\\,\\text{pA}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 0.5 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4731575"}, {"introduction": "Individual neurons and synapses work together to generate complex, rhythmic network activities, or oscillations, which are crucial for cognitive functions like attention and memory.

In this abstraction, a cycle is driven by a volley of excitatory pyramidal neuron spikes followed by recruitment of fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid type A (GABA$_\\text{A}$) receptor synaptic currents then decay until excitatory neurons can fire again. The simplified model assumes two sequential, non-overlapping phases per cycle: an inhibitory phase dominated by the decay of inhibitory synaptic current characterized by a single inhibitory synaptic time constant, and an excitatory phase during which pyramidal neurons are in an absolute refractory state characterized by a single refractory time constant. The following foundational facts must be used to derive the estimator: (i) the period of an oscillation is the minimal inter-event interval that resets the cycle, (ii) the frequency equals the reciprocal of the period, and (iii) time constants are additive for independent, sequential phases when the next cycle cannot begin until both constraints are satisfied.

It is therefore deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Frequency Estimator\n\nThe derivation proceeds by applying the foundational facts provided in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Oscillation Period ($T$) Calculation**\n    The problem defines the oscillation cycle as comprising two sequential and non-overlapping phases: an inhibitory phase and an excitatory refractory phase. Foundational fact (iii) states that for such independent, sequential phases, the total time is the sum of the individual phase durations. The durations are characterized by their respective time constants, $\\tau_{synI}$ and $\\tau_{refE}$. Therefore, the total period of one oscillation, $T_{base}$, is the sum of these two time constants.\n    $$\n    T_{base} = \\tau_{synI} + \\tau_{refE}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Baseline Frequency ($f_{base}$) Calculation**\n    Foundational fact (ii) states that frequency is the reciprocal of the period. The parameters $\\tau_{synI}$ and $\\tau_{refE}$ are given in milliseconds ($ms$), while the desired frequency is in hertz ($Hz$), or cycles per second ($s^{-1}$). Thus, the period $T_{base}$ must be converted from milliseconds to seconds by dividing by $1000$.\n    $$\n    T_{base, s} = \\frac{T_{base, ms}}{1000} = \\frac{\\tau_{synI} + \\tau_{refE}}{1000}\n    $$\n    The baseline frequency, $f_{base}$, is then:\n    $$\n    f_{base} = \\frac{1}{T_{base, s}} = \\frac{1000}{\\tau_{synI} + \\tau_{refE}}\n    $$\n    where $\\tau_{synI}$ and $\\tau_{refE}$ are in milliseconds.\n\n3.  **Prolonged Frequency ($f_{prolong}$) Calculation**\n    The problem introduces a prolongation of the inhibitory synaptic decay, where the time constant $\\tau_{synI}$ is multiplied by a dimensionless factor $k > 1$. The new inhibitory time constant, $\\tau'_{synI}$, is:\n    $$\n    \\tau'_{synI} = k \\cdot \\tau_{synI}\n    $$\n    The excitatory refractory period, $\\tau_{refE}$, is unaffected. The new oscillation period, $T_{prolong}$, is calculated by substituting $\\tau'_{synI}$ into the period equation:\n    $$\n    T_{prolong} = \\tau'_{synI} + \\tau_{refE} = k \\cdot \\tau_{synI} + \\tau_{refE}\n    $$\n    Converting $T_{prolong}$ to seconds and taking the reciprocal gives the prolonged frequency, $f_{prolong}$:\n    $$\n    f_{prolong} = \\frac{1000}{T_{prolong, ms}} = \\frac{1000}{k \\cdot \\tau_{synI} + \\tau_{refE}}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Analysis of Frequency Change**\n    We must determine if the prolonged frequency is strictly less than the baseline frequency, i.e., if $f_{prolong} < f_{base}$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{1000}{k \\cdot \\tau_{synI} + \\tau_{refE}} < \\frac{1000}{\\tau_{synI} + \\tau_{refE}}\n    $$\n    Since all parameters ($k$, $\\tau_{synI}$, $\\tau_{refE}$) are positive, we can take the reciprocal of both sides and reverse the inequality sign:\n    $$\n    k \\cdot \\tau_{synI} + \\tau_{refE} > \\tau_{synI} + \\tau_{refE}\n    $$\n    Subtracting $\\tau_{refE}$ from both sides yields:\n    $$\n    k \\cdot \\tau_{synI} > \\tau_{synI}\n    $$\n    Since $\\tau_{synI}$ is a positive time constant, we can divide both sides by $\\tau_{synI}$ without changing the inequality's direction:\n    $$\n    k > 1\n    $$\n    The problem statement specifies that $k > 1$. Therefore, the inequality $f_{prolong} < f_{base}$ is analytically proven to be true for all valid inputs.

Fractional Anisotropy (FA) is defined as $\\mathrm{FA} = k A$, where the scale factor $k$ is chosen so that $0 \\le \\mathrm{FA} \\le 1$ and $\\mathrm{FA} = 1$ for perfectly uniaxial diffusion (that is, $\\lambda_1 > 0$ and $\\lambda_2=\\lambda_3=0$).\n\n1. Using the above definitions and the uniaxial diffusion requirement, derive the closed-form expression for $k$ and hence $\\mathrm{FA}$ in terms of $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$.\n2. The measured eigenvalues (in $\\mathrm{mm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$) for the patient are $\\lambda_1 = 1.60 \\times 10^{-3}$, $\\lambda_2 = 0.90 \\times 10^{-3}$, $\\lambda_3 = 0.85 \\times 10^{-3}$, and for the control are $\\lambda_1 = 1.80 \\times 10^{-3}$, $\\lambda_2 = 0.50 \\times 10^{-3}$, $\\lambda_3 = 0.45 \\times 10^{-3}$.

It provides standard definitions from the field of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and asks for a derivation and calculation based on these definitions. All necessary data are provided. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the scaling factor $k$ and the expression for Fractional Anisotropy ($\\mathrm{FA}$).\n\nThe problem defines the following quantities:\nThe eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor: $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$.\nThe mean diffusivity:\n$$ \\bar{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\lambda_1+\\lambda_2+\\lambda_3}{3} $$\nThe unscaled anisotropy measure:\n$$ A = \\frac{\\sqrt{(\\lambda_1-\\bar{\\lambda})^2+(\\lambda_2-\\bar{\\lambda})^2+(\\lambda_3-\\bar{\\lambda})^2}}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_1^2+\\lambda_2^2+\\lambda_3^2}} $$\nThe Fractional Anisotropy ($\\mathrm{FA}$):\n$$ \\mathrm{FA} = k \\, A $$\nThe scaling factor $k$ is determined by the condition that $\\mathrm{FA} = 1$ for the case of perfectly uniaxial diffusion, which is defined by $\\lambda_1 > 0$ and $\\lambda_2=\\lambda_3=0$.\n\nWe will now calculate the value of $A$ for the uniaxial case.\nFirst, we find the mean diffusivity $\\bar{\\lambda}$ under these conditions:\n$$ \\bar{\\lambda}_{\\text{uniaxial}} = \\frac{\\lambda_1 + 0 + 0}{3} = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{3} $$\nNext, we substitute this into the expression for the numerator of $A$:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\lambda_1-\\frac{\\lambda_1}{3}\\right)^2+\\left(0-\\frac{\\lambda_1}{3}\\right)^2+\\left(0-\\frac{\\lambda_1}{3}\\right)^2} $$\n$$ = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{2\\lambda_1}{3}\\right)^2+\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda_1}{3}\\right)^2+\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda_1}{3}\\right)^2} $$\n$$ = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\lambda_1^2}{9}+\\frac{\\lambda_1^2}{9}+\\frac{\\lambda_1^2}{9}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6\\lambda_1^2}{9}} = \\lambda_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} $$\nsince $\\lambda_1 > 0$.\n\nNow, we calculate the denominator of $A$ for the uniaxial case:\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = \\sqrt{\\lambda_1^2+0^2+0^2} = \\sqrt{\\lambda_1^2} = \\lambda_1 $$\nCombining these, the value of $A$ for uniaxial diffusion, denoted $A_{\\text{uniaxial}}$, is:\n$$ A_{\\text{uniaxial}} = \\frac{\\lambda_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}}{\\lambda_1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} $$\nThe condition $\\mathrm{FA}=1$ for this case gives:\n$$ 1 = k \\cdot A_{\\text{uniaxial}} = k \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} $$\nSolving for $k$, we find the scaling factor:\n$$ k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2/3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} $$\nThus, the closed-form expression for Fractional Anisotropy is:\n$$ \\mathrm{FA} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} \\frac{\\sqrt{(\\lambda_1-\\bar{\\lambda})^2+(\\lambda_2-\\bar{\\lambda})^2+(\\lambda_3-\\bar{\\lambda})^2}}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_1^2+\\lambda_2^2+\\lambda_3^2}} $$\nwhere $\\bar{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\lambda_1+\\lambda_2+\\lambda_3}{3}$. This is the standard definition of $\\mathrm{FA}$.\n\nPart 2: Computation of $\\mathrm{FA}$ for the patient and the control.\n\nThe value of $\\mathrm{FA}$ is a dimensionless ratio. The units of the eigenvalues ($\\mathrm{mm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$) and the common scaling factor of $10^{-3}$ will cancel out in the calculation. We can therefore perform the calculation using the given numerical coefficients.\n\nFor the patient (P):\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{1,P} = 1.60 \\times 10^{-3}$, $\\lambda_{2,P} = 0.90 \\times 10^{-3}$, and $\\lambda_{3,P} = 0.85 \\times 10^{-3}$. We use the coefficients $\\lambda_1=1.60$, $\\lambda_2=0.90$, $\\lambda_3=0.85$.\nThe mean diffusivity is:\n$$ \\bar{\\lambda}_P = \\frac{1.60+0.90+0.85}{3} = \\frac{3.35}{3} $$\nThe sum of squared differences from the mean is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (\\lambda_{i,P}-\\bar{\\lambda}_P)^2 = \\left(1.60-\\frac{3.35}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(0.90-\\frac{3.35}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(0.85-\\frac{3.35}{3}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ = \\left(\\frac{4.80-3.35}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2.70-3.35}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{2.55-3.35}{3}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ = \\left(\\frac{1.45}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{-0.65}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{-0.80}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{9}(2.1025 + 0.4225 + 0.6400) = \\frac{3.165}{9} $$\nThe sum of squares of the eigenvalues is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\lambda_{i,P}^2 = 1.60^2 + 0.90^2 + 0.85^2 = 2.56 + 0.81 + 0.7225 = 4.0925 $$\nNow, we compute $\\mathrm{FA}_P$:\n$$ \\mathrm{FA}_P = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} \\frac{\\sqrt{3.165/9}}{\\sqrt{4.0925}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3.165}{9 \\cdot 4.0925}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3.165}{6 \\cdot 4.0925}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3.165}{24.555}} \\approx 0.35899 $$\n\nFor the control (C):\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{1,C} = 1.80 \\times 10^{-3}$, $\\lambda_{2,C} = 0.50 \\times 10^{-3}$, and $\\lambda_{3,C} = 0.45 \\times 10^{-3}$. We use the coefficients $\\lambda_1=1.80$, $\\lambda_2=0.50$, $\\lambda_3=0.45$.\nThe mean diffusivity is:\n$$ \\bar{\\lambda}_C = \\frac{1.80+0.50+0.45}{3} = \\frac{2.75}{3} $$\nThe sum of squared differences from the mean is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (\\lambda_{i,C}-\\bar{\\lambda}_C)^2 = \\left(1.80-\\frac{2.75}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(0.50-\\frac{2.75}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(0.45-\\frac{2.75}{3}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ = \\left(\\frac{5.40-2.75}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1.50-2.75}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1.35-2.75}{3}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ = \\left(\\frac{2.65}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{-1.25}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{-1.40}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{9}(7.0225 + 1.5625 + 1.9600) = \\frac{10.545}{9} $$\nThe sum of squares of the eigenvalues is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\lambda_{i,C}^2 = 1.80^2 + 0.50^2 + 0.45^2 = 3.24 + 0.25 + 0.2025 = 3.6925 $$\nNow, we compute $\\mathrm{FA}_C$:\n$$ \\mathrm{FA}_C = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} \\frac{\\sqrt{10.545/9}}{\\sqrt{3.6925}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{10.545}{9 \\cdot 3.6925}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10.545}{6 \\cdot 3.6925}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10.545}{22.155}} \\approx 0.68990 $$\n\nBrief Interpretation: The computed $\\mathrm{FA}$ value for the patient ($\\mathrm{FA}_P \\approx 0.36$) is substantially lower than that for the healthy control ($\\mathrm{FA}_C \\approx 0.69$). Fractional Anisotropy is a measure of white matter microstructural integrity. A higher $\\mathrm{FA}$ value indicates more directional coherence of water diffusion, which reflects highly organized and myelinated axonal tracts. A lower $\\mathrm{FA}$ suggests reduced integrity, which may arise from demyelination, axonal damage, or less coherent fiber organization. The uncinate fasciculus connects the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala, forming a critical part of the brain's emotion regulation circuitry. The observed lower $\\mathrm{FA}$ in the patient with major depressive disorder is consistent with a widely reported finding in psychiatric neuroimaging, suggesting that compromised structural connectivity in this fronto-limbic pathway may be a neurobiological substrate for deficits in emotion regulation characteristic of depression.\n\nPart 3: Patient-to-control $\\mathrm{FA}$ ratio.\n\nThe final step is to compute the ratio of the patient's $\\mathrm{FA}$ to the control's $\\mathrm{FA}$ and round the result to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\mathrm{FA}_P}{\\mathrm{FA}_C} = \\frac{0.35899...}{0.68990...} \\approx 0.52035... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $0.5204$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5204}\n$$", "id": "4731622"}]}
