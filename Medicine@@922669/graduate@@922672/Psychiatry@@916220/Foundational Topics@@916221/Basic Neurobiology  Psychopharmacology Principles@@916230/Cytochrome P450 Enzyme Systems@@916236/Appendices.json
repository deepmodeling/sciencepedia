All assumptions are explicitly listed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing systemic drug exposure at steady-state for a drug exhibiting linear pharmacokinetics is that the area under the plasma concentration-time curve over one dosing interval, $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,ss}$, is directly proportional to the dose administered and inversely proportional to the systemic clearance of the drug. For oral administration, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$ \\mathrm{AUC} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL} $$\nwhere $\\mathrm{AUC}$ represents the area under the curve, $F$ is the oral bioavailability, $D$ is the maintenance dose, and $CL$ is the systemic clearance. The problem seeks to equate the $\\mathrm{AUC}$ between a normal metabolizer (NM) and a poor metabolizer (PM).\n\nLet the variables for the normal metabolizer be denoted with a subscript $\\mathrm{NM}$, and those for the poor metabolizer with a subscript $\\mathrm{PM}$. The condition to be satisfied is:\n$$ \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{NM}} = \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{PM}} $$\n\nSubstituting the pharmacokinetic formula for $\\mathrm{AUC}$ into this equality gives:\n$$ \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{NM}} \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{NM}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{NM}}} = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{PM}} \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{PM}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{PM}}} $$\n\nThe problem states that oral bioavailability is constant across genotypes, which implies $F_{\\mathrm{NM}} = F_{\\mathrm{PM}} = F$. Since $F > 0$, we can cancel this term from both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{NM}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{NM}}} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{PM}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{PM}}} $$\n\nWe are given two key relationships based on the genetic polymorphism:\n$1$. The poor metabolizer’s clearance is reduced by $50\\%$ relative to the normal metabolizer. This can be written as:\n$$ CL_{\\mathrm{PM}} = CL_{\\mathrm{NM}} - 0.50 \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{NM}} = (1 - 0.50) \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{NM}} = 0.5 \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{NM}} $$\n\n$2$. The maintenance dose for the poor metabolizer is the normal metabolizer's dose scaled by a factor $a$:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{PM}} = a \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{NM}} $$\n\nNow, we substitute these two expressions for $CL_{\\mathrm{PM}}$ and $D_{\\mathrm{PM}}$ into our simplified equality:\n$$ \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{NM}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{NM}}} = \\frac{a \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{NM}}}{0.5 \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{NM}}} $$\n\nAssuming a non-zero dose is administered ($D_{\\mathrm{NM}} \\neq 0$) and the drug is cleared ($CL_{\\mathrm{NM}} \\neq 0$), we can cancel both $D_{\\mathrm{NM}}$ and $CL_{\\mathrm{NM}}$ from the equation:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{a}{0.5} $$\n\nSolving for the multiplicative factor $a$ yields:\n$$ a = 0.5 $$\n\nThis result is logical: to maintain the same systemic exposure in an individual with half the clearance capacity, the dose must be reduced by half.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5}$$", "id": "4704622"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of altered clearance, we now shift from an intrinsic genetic factor to an extrinsic one: a drug-drug interaction (DDI).

The problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not violate any fundamental scientific principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe fundamental principle of pharmacokinetics at steady state is that the rate of drug administration is equal to the rate of drug elimination. For an orally administered drug, the rate at which the drug enters the systemic circulation is the product of its bioavailability, $F$, and the dosing rate. The dosing rate is the dose, $D$, divided by the dosing interval, $\\tau$. In this problem, the dose is given as a daily amount, so we can define the dosing rate as $D$ per day.\n\nRate of drug administration = $F \\times D$\nRate of drug elimination = $Cl_T \\times C_{ss}$\n\nHere, $Cl_T$ is the total body clearance and $C_{ss}$ is the average steady-state plasma concentration.\n\nAt steady state, these rates are equal:\n$$F \\times D = Cl_T \\times C_{ss}$$\n\nThis equation can be rearranged to express the steady-state concentration:\n$$C_{ss} = \\frac{F \\times D}{Cl_T}$$\n\nLet us denote the initial state (before fluvoxamine) with subscript $1$ and the final state (after fluvoxamine) with subscript $2$.\n\nFor the initial state:\n$$C_{ss,1} = \\frac{F_1 \\times D_1}{Cl_{T,1}}$$\nwhere $D_1 = 300$ mg/day.\n\nFor the final state, a new dose $D_2$ is sought to achieve the same steady-state concentration, $C_{ss,2} = C_{ss,1}$.\n$$C_{ss,2} = \\frac{F_2 \\times D_2}{Cl_{T,2}}$$\n\nThe problem requires that the steady-state concentration be maintained, so $C_{ss,1} = C_{ss,2}$.\n$$\\frac{F_1 \\times D_1}{Cl_{T,1}} = \\frac{F_2 \\times D_2}{Cl_{T,2}}$$\n\nThe problem states that bioavailability remains unchanged, so $F_1 = F_2 = F$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{D_1}{Cl_{T,1}} = \\frac{D_2}{Cl_{T,2}}$$\n\nWe can solve for the required new dose, $D_2$:\n$$D_2 = D_1 \\times \\frac{Cl_{T,2}}{Cl_{T,1}}$$\n\nThe next step is to determine the ratio of the new total clearance to the old total clearance, $\\frac{Cl_{T,2}}{Cl_{T,1}}$.\n\nTotal clearance, $Cl_T$, is the sum of clearance from all eliminating organs. The problem states that clozapine is primarily metabolized hepatically. Therefore, we can approximate the total clearance by the hepatic clearance, $Cl_H$.\n$$Cl_T \\approx Cl_H$$\n\nThe problem states that clozapine has a low hepatic extraction. For a drug with a low hepatic extraction ratio, hepatic clearance is not limited by blood flow but by the enzymatic capacity of the liver. In this case, hepatic clearance is well approximated as the product of the fraction of drug unbound in the blood, $f_u$, and the intrinsic clearance, $Cl_{int}$.\n$$Cl_H \\approx f_u \\times Cl_{int}$$\nThe problem states that protein binding is unchanged, which implies that the unbound fraction, $f_u$, is constant.\n\nTherefore, the total clearance is directly proportional to the intrinsic clearance:\n$$Cl_T \\propto Cl_{int}$$\n\nWe can now express the ratio of the total clearances in terms of the intrinsic clearances:\n$$\\frac{Cl_{T,2}}{Cl_{T,1}} = \\frac{Cl_{int,2}}{Cl_{int,1}}$$\n\nThe problem states that after fluvoxamine initiation, the intrinsic metabolic clearance of clozapine is reduced by $50\\%$. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$Cl_{int,2} = Cl_{int,1} - (0.50 \\times Cl_{int,1}) = (1 - 0.50) \\times Cl_{int,1} = 0.50 \\times Cl_{int,1}$$\n\nSubstituting this relationship into the clearance ratio equation:\n$$\\frac{Cl_{T,2}}{Cl_{T,1}} = \\frac{0.50 \\times Cl_{int,1}}{Cl_{int,1}} = 0.50$$\n\nNow, we substitute this clearance ratio back into the equation for the new dose, $D_2$:\n$$D_2 = D_1 \\times 0.50$$\n\nGiven the initial dose $D_1 = 300$ mg/day:\n$$D_2 = 300 \\, \\text{mg/day} \\times 0.50 = 150 \\, \\text{mg/day}$$\n\nThe question requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$D_2 = 150.0 \\, \\text{mg/day}$$\nThe new daily dose required to maintain the original steady-state concentration is $150.0$ mg/day.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{150.0}$$", "id": "4704642"}, {"introduction": "The previous exercises assumed a known, fixed change in clearance.

The problem states that pharmacokinetics are linear, meaning the substrate concentration is well below the Michaelis-Menten constant ($[S] \\ll K_m$). In this regime, the clearance of a metabolic pathway is given by the ratio of the maximal rate of metabolism ($V_{max}$) to the Michaelis-Menten constant ($K_m$):\n$$CL_{pathway} = \\frac{V_{max}}{K_m}$$\nFor competitive inhibition, $V_{max}$ is unaffected, but the apparent $K_m$, denoted $K_{m,app}$, is increased according to the equation:\n$$K_{m,app} = K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right)$$\nThe clearance of the inhibited pathway, $CL_{1A2,i}$, is therefore:\n$$CL_{1A2,i} = \\frac{V_{max,1A2}}{K_{m,app,1A2}} = \\frac{V_{max,1A2}}{K_{m,1A2} \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right)}$$\nSince the baseline clearance for this pathway is $CL_{1A2} = V_{max,1A2} / K_{m,1A2}$, we can write the inhibited clearance as:\n$$CL_{1A2,i} = \\frac{CL_{1A2}}{1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}}$$\nThe other clearance pathways are unaffected, so their clearance remains $CL_{other}$.
