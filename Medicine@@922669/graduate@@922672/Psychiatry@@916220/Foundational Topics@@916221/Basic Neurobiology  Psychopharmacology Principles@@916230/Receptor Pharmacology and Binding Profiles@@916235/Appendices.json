The fractional receptor occupancy: $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{T}}$\n2.  The total receptor concentration: $[R]_{T} = [R] + [RL]$\n3.  The equilibrium dissociation constant: $K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$\n\nHere, $[R]$ is the concentration of free (unbound) receptors, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand, $[RL]$ is the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex, and $[R]_T$ is the total concentration of receptors.\n\nOur goal is to derive an expression for $\\theta$ solely in terms of $[L]$ and $K_{d}$. We begin by substituting the definition of $[R]_{T}$ from equation (2) into equation (1):\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]} $$\nThis expression still contains $[R]$ and $[RL]$.

This relationship is famously described by the Cheng-Prusoff equation.\n\nLet $R$ denote the free receptor, $L$ the radioligand, and $I$ the inhibitor (antagonist). The system is at equilibrium and involves two simultaneous binding reactions:\n1.  Radioligand binding: $R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$\n2.  Inhibitor binding: $R + I \\rightleftharpoons RI$\n\nThe dissociation constants for these reactions are defined by the law of mass action:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\n$$K_i = \\frac{[R][I]}{[RI]}$$\nwhere brackets denote molar concentrations at equilibrium.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{total}$, is the sum of free receptors, receptors bound to the radioligand, and receptors bound to the inhibitor:\n$$[R]_{total} = [R] + [RL] + [RI]$$\n\nThe fraction of receptors occupied by the radioligand, $f_{RL}$, is given by the ratio of ligand-bound receptors to the total number of receptors:\n$$f_{RL} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{total}}$$\n\nWe can express $[RL]$ and $[RI]$ in terms of $[R]$ using the dissociation constant definitions:\n$$[RL] = \\frac{[R][L]}{K_d}$$\n$$[RI] = \\frac{[R][I]}{K_i}$$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $[R]_{total}$:\n$$[R]_{total} = [R] + \\frac{[R][L]}{K_d} + \\frac{[R][I]}{K_i} = [R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_d} + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} \\right)$$\n\nNow, we can write the fractional occupancy $f_{RL}$ as:\n$$f_{RL} = \\frac{\\frac{[R][L]}{K_d}}{[R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_d} + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} \\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{[L]}{K_d}}{1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_d} + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}}$$\nThis equation describes the fraction of receptors bound by the radioligand $L$ in the presence of a competitive inhibitor $I$.\n\nThe specific binding of the radioligand, $B$, is proportional to this fractional occupancy. In the absence of the inhibitor ($[I]=0$), the specific binding, $B_0$, is proportional to the fractional occupancy under these conditions:\n$$B_0 \\propto f_{RL}([I]=0) = \\frac{\\frac{[L]}{K_d}}{1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_d}}$$\n\nBy definition, the $IC_{50}$ is the concentration of the inhibitor, $[I]$, at which the specific binding is reduced by $50\\%$.

It is a fundamental measure of the antagonist's affinity; a smaller $K_i$ value corresponds to a higher binding affinity. In the context of pharmacology for psychiatric agents targeting central nervous system receptors like the $5\\text{-HT}_{2\\text{A}}$ receptor, affinities are often in the nanomolar ($10^{-9}$ M) range. A $K_i$ value of $20 \\text{ nM}$ indicates a high affinity of the antagonist for the $5\\text{-HT}_{2\\text{A}}$ receptor.
