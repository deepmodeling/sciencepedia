Substituting this into the second normal equation:\n$$\n(\\bar{m} - \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\bar{t}) \\sum t_i + \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\sum t_i^2 = \\sum t_i m_i\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{m} \\sum t_i - \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\bar{t} \\sum t_i + \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\sum t_i^2 = \\sum t_i m_i\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_1 \\left( \\sum t_i^2 - \\bar{t} \\sum t_i \\right) = \\sum t_i m_i - \\bar{m} \\sum t_i\n$$\nSubstituting $\\bar{t} = \\frac{\\sum t_i}{N}$ and $\\bar{m} = \\frac{\\sum m_i}{N}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_1 \\left( \\sum t_i^2 - \\frac{(\\sum t_i)^2}{N} \\right) = \\sum t_i m_i - \\frac{(\\sum m_i)(\\sum t_i)}{N}\n$$\nSolving for $\\hat{\\beta}_1$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{N \\sum t_i m_i - (\\sum t_i)(\\sum m_i)}{N \\sum t_i^2 - (\\sum t_i)^2}\n$$\nWe now compute the required sums from the data:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{3} t_i = 0 + 0.5 + 5 + 13 = 18.5\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{3} m_i = 14.2 + 21.6 + 7.8 + 3.9 = 47.5\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{3} t_i^2 = 0^2 + (0.5)^2 + 5^2 + 13^2 = 0 + 0.25 + 25 + 169 = 194.25\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{3} t_i m_i = (0)(14.2) + (0.5)(21.6) + (5)(7.8) + (13)(3.9) = 0 + 10.8 + 39 + 50.7 = 100.5\n$$\nSubstituting these sums into the expression for $\\hat{\\beta}_1$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{4(100.5) - (18.5)(47.5)}{4(194.25) - (18.5)^2} = \\frac{402 - 878.75}{777 - 342.25} = \\frac{-476.75}{434.75} \\approx -1.096607...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the diurnal cortisol slope is $\\hat{\\beta}_1 = -1.097$ nmol/L/hr.\n\n**2) Computation of Area Under the Curve with Respect to Ground ($AUC_g$)**\n\nThe $AUC_g$ is the integral of the concentration function $m(t)$ from $t_0=0$ to $t_3=13$. We approximate this integral using the composite trapezoidal rule for non-uniformly spaced points:\n$$\nAUC_g = \\int_{t_0}^{t_3} m(t) dt \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{m_{i-1} + m_i}{2} (t_i - t_{i-1})\n$$\nThe calculation is performed over three intervals: $[t_0, t_1]$, $[t_1, t_2]$, and $[t_2, t_3]$.\nArea of the first trapezoid (from $t_0=0$ to $t_1=0.5$):\n$$\nA_1 = \\frac{m_0 + m_1}{2} (t_1 - t_0) = \\frac{14.2 + 21.6}{2} (0.5 - 0) = \\frac{35.8}{2}(0.5) = 17.9 \\times 0.5 = 8.95\n$$\nArea of the second trapezoid (from $t_1=0.5$ to $t_2=5$):\n$$\nA_2 = \\frac{m_1 + m_2}{2} (t_2 - t_1) = \\frac{21.6 + 7.8}{2} (5 - 0.5) = \\frac{29.4}{2}(4.5) = 14.7 \\times 4.5 = 66.15\n$$\nArea of the third trapezoid (from $t_2=5$ to $t_3=13$):\n$$\nA_3 = \\frac{m_2 + m_3}{2} (t_3 - t_2) = \\frac{7.8 + 3.9}{2} (13 - 5) = \\frac{11.7}{2}(8) = 5.85 \\times 8 = 46.8\n$$\nThe total $AUC_g$ is the sum of these areas:\n$$\nAUC_g \\approx A_1 + A_2 + A_3 = 8.95 + 66.15 + 46.8 = 121.9\n$$\nThe value is already at four significant figures. So, $AUC_g = 121.9$ nmol·hr/L.\n\n**3) Computation of Incremental Area Under the Curve ($AUC_i$)**\n\nThe $AUC_i$ is defined as the area of the curve of concentration increments relative to the awakening baseline, $m_0$.
