Assumption (iv) states that naloxone has no other effects on pain. Therefore, the pain rating in the naloxone condition, $P_N$, is equal to the baseline pain reduced by only the non-opioid component of the placebo effect.\n$$P_N = P_B - E_{non-opioid}$$\n\nWe now have a system of equations that can be solved for the components of the placebo effect. From the equation for $P_N$, we can isolate the non-opioid component, $E_{non-opioid}$:\n$$E_{non-opioid} = P_B - P_N$$\n\nWe can now substitute this expression for $E_{non-opioid}$ into the equation for the total placebo effect to find the opioid component, $E_{opioid}$:\n$$E_{opioid} = E_{total} - E_{non-opioid}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $E_{total}$ and $E_{non-opioid}$ in terms of the observed pain ratings:\n$$E_{opioid} = (P_B - P_P) - (P_B - P_N)$$\n$$E_{opioid} = P_B - P_P - P_B + P_N$$\n$$E_{opioid} = P_N - P_P$$\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the opioid-mediated component as a proportion of the total placebo effect.
