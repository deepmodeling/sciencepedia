{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The foundation of a strong case formulation lies in translating a patient's subjective experience into objective, quantifiable data. Standardized rating scales are indispensable for this task, offering a structured method to measure symptom severity and guide the initial diagnostic inquiry. This first practice problem uses the widely recognized Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to demonstrate how a simple score can direct both the differential diagnosis and critical safety assessments [@problem_id:4746100].", "problem": "A patient in an outpatient psychiatric clinic completes the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a nine-item self-report measure where each item score $x_i$ (for $i=1,\\dots,9$) reflects frequency of depressive symptoms over the prior two weeks using an ordinal scale $x_i \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$ corresponding to “not at all,” “several days,” “more than half the days,” and “nearly every day,” respectively. The PHQ-9 total score is defined by the additive rule $S=\\sum_{i=1}^{9} x_i$, taking values in $[0,27]$. Widely used severity bands map $S$ to categorical descriptors: $[0,4]$ minimal, $[5,9]$ mild, $[10,14]$ moderate, $[15,19]$ moderately severe, and $[20,27]$ severe. The ninth item screens for suicidal ideation, and any nonzero value typically triggers structured suicide risk assessment in clinical practice. In a patient referred for evaluation of low mood and anergia, the item-level responses are $x_1=2$, $x_2=3$, $x_3=1$, $x_4=2$, $x_5=2$, $x_6=1$, $x_7=0$, $x_8=2$, $x_9=1$. Using only the definitional scoring rule and the severity band mapping, compute the PHQ-9 total score $S$, determine the corresponding severity band, and explain how this should guide subsequent diagnostic exploration within a comprehensive psychiatric assessment framework that considers core Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) mood disorder differentials, potential substance or medication effects, general medical contributors, and safety evaluation. For grading, report only the numeric total score $S$ as your final answer; no rounding is necessary.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in established clinical psychometrics and psychiatric diagnostic principles. All provided data—the nine item scores $x_i$ from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the scoring rule $S=\\sum_{i=1}^{9} x_i$, and the severity band definitions—are self-contained, consistent, and well-posed, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. The problem requires the application of a defined algorithm and a structured interpretation based on standard clinical guidelines (DSM-5-TR), which is a formalizable process within the scope of medical science.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the total score, $S$, using the provided additive rule and the patient's specific item-level responses. The $9$ item scores are given as:\n$x_1 = 2$\n$x_2 = 3$\n$x_3 = 1$\n$x_4 = 2$\n$x_5 = 2$\n$x_6 = 1$\n$x_7 = 0$\n$x_8 = 2$\n$x_9 = 1$\n\nThe total score $S$ is the sum of these individual item scores:\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{9} x_i = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + x_7 + x_8 + x_9$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$S = 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 1$$\nPerforming the summation:\n$$S = 14$$\n\nThe next step is to determine the corresponding severity band for this score. The problem provides the following mapping from score $S$ to severity:\n- $[0, 4]$: Minimal\n- $[5, 9]$: Mild\n- $[10, 14]$: Moderate\n- $[15, 19]$: Moderately severe\n- $[20, 27]$: Severe\n\nThe calculated score of $S=14$ falls within the closed interval $[10, 14]$, which corresponds to a \"moderate\" level of depressive symptom severity.\n\nFinally, the problem requires an explanation of how this result guides subsequent diagnostic exploration. Although the PHQ-9 is a screening and severity-monitoring tool, not a diagnostic instrument, a score of $14$ is clinically significant and has specific implications for a comprehensive psychiatric assessment.\n\n$1$. **Immediate Safety Evaluation**: The score for item $9$ (thoughts of self-harm or suicide) is $x_9=1$, corresponding to experiencing such thoughts on \"several days\". Any non-zero response to this item is a critical flag that mandates an immediate, structured suicide risk assessment. This evaluation must systematically probe the nature, frequency, and intensity of suicidal ideation; the presence of a suicide plan, intent, and access to means; and an inventory of risk factors (e.g., hopelessness, substance use, prior attempts) and protective factors (e.g., social support, reasons for living). This safety assessment takes precedence over all other diagnostic considerations.\n\n$2$. **Differential Diagnosis Framework**: The score of $14$ (Moderate) strongly suggests the presence of a depressive disorder, guiding the clinician to prioritize this in the differential diagnosis. The assessment should be structured to evaluate criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR):\n    - **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)**: The clinician must systematically verify if the patient meets the criteria for an MDD episode. The PHQ-9 items map directly onto the $9$ criteria for MDD. The patient's reported symptoms (\"low mood and anergia\") correspond to high scores on items $x_2$ (depressed mood, score $3$) and $x_4$ (fatigue/anergia, score $2$), which are two of the cardinal symptoms of MDD. The clinician must confirm the duration (at least $2$ weeks) and a total of at least $5$ of the $9$ symptoms, causing clinically significant distress or impairment.\n    - **Other Depressive Disorders**: The differential must also include Persistent Depressive Disorder (dysthymia), which involves a chronic (at least $2$ years) but often less severe course of depression.\n    - **Bipolar and Related Disorders**: It is crucial to screen for any history of manic or hypomanic episodes. A diagnosis of MDD is incorrect if such episodes have occurred, in which case a Bipolar I or Bipolar II Disorder diagnosis would be more appropriate.\n    - **Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder**: A thorough history of alcohol, prescription, over-the-counter, and illicit substance use is required to rule out symptoms as a physiological effect of a substance.\n    - **Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**: The patient's symptoms could be a manifestation of an underlying general medical condition. The reported anergia ($x_4=2$) especially warrants a medical workup, which may include laboratory tests to screen for conditions such as hypothyroidism (TSH), anemia (CBC), or vitamin deficiencies (e.g., $\\text{B}_{12}$, D).\n\nIn summary, the calculated PHQ-9 score of $S=14$ quantifies the patient's depressive symptoms as \"moderate\" and, combined with the critical finding of $x_9=1$, dictates a two-pronged immediate action: a comprehensive suicide risk assessment and a structured differential diagnostic evaluation for mood disorders, while ruling out substance-induced or medical etiologies. The problem asks for the numeric total score as the final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{14}\n$$", "id": "4746100"}, {"introduction": "Once preliminary data are gathered, the clinician's next task is to apply diagnostic criteria with rigor and precision. This process is not a simple checklist but a careful synthesis of symptom patterns, duration, functional impairment, and exclusionary conditions as laid out in frameworks like the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR). This exercise provides an in-depth simulation of this process, requiring you to analyze a complex case vignette and determine if it meets the stringent criteria for schizophrenia, a skill essential for accurate diagnosis [@problem_id:4746079].", "problem": "A clinician is evaluating a 29-year-old patient for a primary psychotic disorder and must determine whether the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) criteria for schizophrenia are met, and then assign the International Classification of Diseases, Eleventh Revision (ICD-11) equivalent classification with an appropriate course qualifier. Use the following foundational facts that are widely accepted in clinical psychiatry: DSM-5-TR schizophrenia requires a constellation of symptom presence and duration criteria (A–F), and ICD-11 provides an equivalent schizophrenia classification with standardized course qualifiers.\n\nThe patient’s timeline and clinical features are as follows, all anchored to an index date of clinical assessment at $t=0$ months:\n\n- From $t=-9$ to $t=-7$ months ($2$ months), there were continuous prodromal signs, including social withdrawal and affective blunting, with decline in occupational functioning relative to prior baseline (lost employment and reduced role performance).\n- From $t=-7$ to $t=-2$ months ($5$ months), there were daily active psychotic symptoms: persecutory delusions, second-person auditory hallucinations, and disorganized speech; these were accompanied by negative symptoms (avolition and alogia). The symptoms were present for a significant portion of time during each month.\n- From $t=-2$ to $t=0$ months ($2$ months), there was partial remission: no persistent delusions or hallucinations on most days, but residual negative symptoms and mild thought disorganization persisted, with functional impairment still present compared to pre-morbid baseline.\n- A major depressive episode occurred once, lasting $4$ weeks ($28$ days) during the active phase (centered around $t=-5$ months). Psychotic symptoms were present both outside and during this mood episode. There were no episodes meeting criteria for mania or hypomania; a brief $2$-day period of elevated mood did not meet threshold for a mood episode.\n- Comprehensive medical workup (including thyroid function tests, vitamin $B_{12}$, and brain magnetic resonance imaging) was unremarkable. Toxicology was negative during symptom periods, and the last reported cannabis use was $>12$ months before onset. There is no history of autism spectrum disorder or childhood-onset communication disorder.\n\nDefine binary indicators $b_{A}, b_{B}, b_{C}, b_{D}, b_{E}, b_{F} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for DSM-5-TR schizophrenia criteria A–F, respectively, where $1$ indicates the criterion is met and $0$ indicates it is not.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in established psychiatric diagnostic criteria (DSM-5-TR, ICD-11), well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its presentation of a clinical case. The problem is a formal exercise in applying these diagnostic rules.\n\nThe task is to determine the diagnostic index $D = 1000\\,c + 100\\,m + s$. This requires determining the values of the binary indicators $b_{A}$ through $b_{F}$ for the DSM-5-TR schizophrenia criteria, the ICD-11 category code $c$, and the ICD-11 course qualifier code $m$.\n\nFirst, we evaluate each of the six DSM-5-TR criteria for schizophrenia based on the provided clinical information.\n\n**Criterion A: Characteristic Symptoms**\nThis criterion requires two or more of the following five symptoms, with at least one being delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech, for a significant portion of time during a $1$-month period.\n1. Delusions\n2. Hallucinations\n3. Disorganized speech\n4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior\n5. Negative symptoms\n\nFrom $t=-7$ to $t=-2$ months, a period of $5$ months, the patient experienced daily persecutory delusions (1), second-person auditory hallucinations (2), disorganized speech (3), and negative symptoms of avolition and alogia (5). Since the patient exhibited four of these symptoms, including the first three, for a period far exceeding $1$ month, Criterion A is met.\nTherefore, $b_{A} = 1$.\n\n**Criterion B: Social/Occupational Dysfunction**\nThis criterion requires a significant decline in functioning in major life areas since the onset of the disturbance. The patient experienced a \"decline in occupational functioning,\" including losing employment. This functional impairment has persisted. Thus, Criterion B is met.\nTherefore, $b_{B} = 1$.\n\n**Criterion C: Duration**\nThis criterion requires that continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least $6$ months. This period must include at least $1$ month of active-phase symptoms (Criterion A). The patient's illness timeline consists of a $2$-month prodromal phase ($t=-9$ to $t=-7$), a $5$-month active phase ($t=-7$ to $t=-2$), and a $2$-month residual phase ($t=-2$ to $t=0$). The total duration of continuous signs is $2+5+2=9$ months. This duration exceeds the $6$-month threshold and includes a $5$-month active phase. Thus, Criterion C is met.\nTherefore, $b_{C} = 1$.\n\n**Criterion D: Schizoaffective and Mood Disorder Exclusion**\nThis criterion serves to exclude schizoaffective disorder and mood disorder with psychotic features. It requires that if mood episodes have occurred during the active phase, their total duration is a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods. A single major depressive episode occurred, lasting $4$ weeks (approximately $1$ month). The total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness is $5$ months + $2$ months = $7$ months. The ratio of the mood episode duration to the total illness duration is $\\frac{1}{7}$, which constitutes a minority. Furthermore, psychotic symptoms were present outside of the mood episode. Therefore, these other disorders are ruled out, and Criterion D is met.\nTherefore, $b_{D} = 1$.\n\n**Criterion E: Substance/Medical Condition Exclusion**\nThis criterion requires that the disturbance is not due to the effects of a substance or another medical condition. The problem states that a comprehensive medical workup was unremarkable and toxicology was negative. This rules out medical and substance-induced causes. Thus, Criterion E is met.\nTherefore, $b_{E} = 1$.\n\n**Criterion F: Relationship to Autism Spectrum or Communication Disorder Exclusion**\nThis criterion places additional requirements if there is a history of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or a childhood-onset communication disorder. The problem explicitly states there is no such history. Thus, Criterion F is met by default.\nTherefore, $b_{F} = 1$.\n\nSince all criteria $A$ through $F$ are met, the diagnosis of schizophrenia is confirmed. The binary indicators are all $1$.\n\nNext, we compute the six-bit mask integer $s$:\n$$\ns \\;=\\; b_{A}\\,2^{5} \\;+\\; b_{B}\\,2^{4} \\;+\\; b_{C}\\,2^{3} \\;+\\; b_{D}\\,2^{2} \\;+\\; b_{E}\\,2^{1} \\;+\\; b_{F}\\,2^{0}\n$$\n$$\ns \\;=\\; (1)(2^{5}) \\;+\\; (1)(2^{4}) \\;+\\; (1)(2^{3}) \\;+\\; (1)(2^{2}) \\;+\\; (1)(2^{1}) \\;+\\; (1)(2^{0})\n$$\n$$\ns \\;=\\; 32 \\;+\\; 16 \\;+\\; 8 \\;+\\; 4 \\;+\\; 2 \\;+\\; 1 \\;=\\; 63\n$$\n\nNow, we determine the ICD-11 codes $c$ and $m$.\nThe ICD-11 equivalent classification for a diagnosis of Schizophrenia is given the code $c=1$.\n\nThe course qualifier $m$ is determined by the episode history and current status. The patient is experiencing their first episode of illness. At the time of assessment ($t=0$), the patient is in a state of partial remission (residual symptoms present but active-phase symptoms are not prominent). According to the provided mapping, this corresponds to \"First episode, currently in partial remission\".\nTherefore, the course qualifier code is $m=2$.\n\nFinally, we compute the composite diagnostic index $D$:\n$$\nD \\;=\\; 1000\\,c \\;+\\; 100\\,m \\;+\\; s\n$$\nSubstituting the determined values:\n$c = 1$\n$m = 2$\n$s = 63$\n$$\nD \\;=\\; 1000(1) \\;+\\; 100(2) \\;+\\; 63\n$$\n$$\nD \\;=\\; 1000 \\;+\\; 200 \\;+\\; 63 \\;=\\; 1263\n$$\nThe final composite diagnostic index is $1263$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1263}$$", "id": "4746079"}, {"introduction": "Psychiatric formulation often involves navigating diagnostic uncertainty, and evidence-based practice provides quantitative tools to refine our clinical judgment.
