Since $\\beta$ is a constant, this is equal to $\\beta^2 \\operatorname{Var}(G)$. Our task is to compute this value for the pooled sample.\n\nThe pooled sample is a mixture of two ancestries, $A$ and $B$. Let $S$ be a random variable representing the ancestry of an individual, such that $S \\in \\{A, B\\}$. The problem states the population weights are $w_A = P(S=A) = 0.6$ and $w_B = P(S=B) = 0.4$.\n\nTo find the variance of the genotype score $G$ in the pooled sample, we use the Law of Total Variance:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(G) = E[\\operatorname{Var}(G|S)] + \\operatorname{Var}(E[G|S])$$\n\nWe will compute each term separately.\n\nFirst Term: $E[\\operatorname{Var}(G|S)]$\nThis term represents the average of the within-ancestry variances, weighted by the population frequencies.\n$$E[\\operatorname{Var}(G|S)] = \\operatorname{Var}(G|S=A) \\cdot P(S=A) + \\operatorname{Var}(G|S=B) \\cdot P(S=B)$$\n$$E[\\operatorname{Var}(G|S)] = \\operatorname{Var}_A(G) \\cdot w_A + \\operatorname{Var}_B(G) \\cdot w_B$$\nWithin each ancestry, the problem states that Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) holds.
