The clinical question is whether the mood symptoms are primarily a substance-induced mood disorder versus an independent mood disorder.

The derivation must proceed from first principles as stipulated.\n\nLet $D$ denote the event that the patient has a substance-induced mood disorder.\nLet $\\neg D$ denote the complementary event that the patient has an independent mood disorder.\nLet $T$ be the event that the patient has a positive AUDIT result.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are:\n1.  The prior probability of a substance-induced mood disorder: $P(D) = 0.40$.\n2.  The positive likelihood ratio for the AUDIT test: $LR^{+} = 3$.\n\nThe goal is to find the post-test probability of a substance-induced mood disorder given a positive test result, which is denoted by $P(D|T)$.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between probability and odds. The odds of an event $A$ are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{P(\\neg A)} $$\nThe prior odds of having a substance-induced mood disorder, $\\text{Odds}(D)$, are calculated using the given prior probability $P(D)$. The probability of the alternative, an independent mood disorder, is $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D)$.\n$$ P(\\neg D) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60 $$\nTherefore, the prior odds are:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{P(\\neg D)} = \\frac{0.40}{0.60} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nNext, we need to determine the post-test odds, which are the odds of having the disorder after observing a positive test result, $\\text{Odds}(D|T)$.\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D|T) = \\frac{P(D|T)}{P(\\neg D|T)} $$\nTo derive the update rule, we apply Bayes' theorem to both the numerator and the denominator of the post-test odds expression. Bayes' theorem states $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$.\nFor the numerator, $P(D|T)$:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)} $$\nFor the denominator, $P(\\neg D|T)$:\n$$ P(\\neg D|T) = \\frac{P(T|\\neg D)P(\\neg D)}{P(T)} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for post-test odds:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D|T) = \\frac{\\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)}}{\\frac{P(T|\\neg D)P(\\neg D)}{P(T)}} $$\nThe term $P(T)$, the overall probability of a positive test, cancels out:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T|\\neg D)P(\\neg D)} $$\nThis expression can be rearranged by grouping terms:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D|T) = \\left(\\frac{P(D)}{P(\\neg D)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(T|D)}{P(T|\\neg D)}\\right) $$\nWe recognize the first term as the prior odds, $\\text{Odds}(D)$, and the second term as the definition of the positive likelihood ratio, $LR^{+}$:\n$$ LR^{+} = \\frac{P(T|D)}{P(T|\\neg D)} $$\nThis yields the fundamental relationship of the odds-likelihood framework:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D|T) = \\text{Odds}(D) \\times LR^{+} $$\nThis equation shows that the post-test odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio.

Clozapine is primarily metabolized by Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2). Combustion products in tobacco smoke induce CYP1A2 activity. Assume the following well-tested pharmacokinetic facts and definitions hold: at steady state under linear, first-order kinetics with constant dosing interval and bioavailability, the trough (nadir) concentration is proportional to dose divided by clearance; induction of CYP1A2 by smoking increases clearance; and, under the simplifying assumption of proportionality over the relevant range, the clearance scales linearly with smoking intensity. Formally, let the clozapine clearance be modeled as\n$$\nCL(S) = CL_{0}\\left(1 + \\alpha S\\right),\n$$\nwhere $CL(S)$ is the clearance at smoking intensity $S$ (cigarettes per day), $CL_{0}$ is the baseline clearance in the absence of smoking, and $\\alpha$ is the induction parameter per cigarette per day.\n\nThe patient currently smokes $S_{b} = 40$ cigarettes per day.

A reduction in smoking from $S_b=40$ to $S_a=20$ cigarettes/day decreases clozapine clearance. With an unchanged dose, this correctly leads to an increase in the steady-state concentration. The calculated new level is below the toxicity threshold, confirming the reasoning.\n\nNext, we calculate the adjusted dose $D_{a}$ required to maintain the target concentration, i.e., $C_{a} = C_{b} = 350$ ng/mL.\nUsing our general ratio equation and setting $C_{a} = C_{b}$, the ratio $\\frac{C_{a}}{C_{b}}$ becomes $1$:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{D_{a}}{D_{b}} \\frac{1 + \\alpha S_{b}}{1 + \\alpha S_{a}}\n$$\nSolving for the new dose $D_{a}$:\n$$\nD_{a} = D_{b} \\frac{1 + \\alpha S_{a}}{1 + \\alpha S_{b}}\n$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\nD_{a} = (400 \\, \\text{mg/day}) \\frac{1.3}{1.6}\n$$\n$$\nD_{a} = 400 \\times 0.8125 \\, \\text{mg/day}\n$$\n$$\nD_{a} = 325 \\, \\text{mg/day}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The risk of an adverse event is the probability of that event occurring in a defined population over a specified time period.\nThe problem provides two such risks:\n1.  The risk of at least one psychiatric hospitalization over $6$ months for the usual care (control) group, denoted as $p_c$. The given value is $p_c = 0.30$.\n2.  The risk of the same event over the same period for the integrated dual-diagnosis treatment (intervention) group, denoted as $p_t$. The given value is $p_t = 0.20$.\n\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is the absolute difference in the event rates between the control and treatment groups. It quantifies the reduction in risk attributable to the intervention. The formula for ARR is:\n$$\n\\text{ARR} = p_c - p_t\n$$\nThe ARR represents the proportion of individuals who are spared the adverse outcome as a result of receiving the treatment instead of the control. For every person treated, their probability of the adverse outcome is reduced by the amount ARR.\n\nFrom this first principle, we derive the concept of the Number Needed to Treat (NNT). The NNT is the average number of patients who need to be treated with the intervention to prevent one additional adverse outcome, compared to the control group. Let $N$ be the number of patients treated. The total number of adverse events expected to be prevented in this group of $N$ patients is the product of the number of patients and the risk reduction per patient:\n$$\n\\text{Expected Events Prevented} = N \\times \\text{ARR}\n$$\nThe NNT is the specific value of $N$ for which the number of expected events prevented is exactly one.

An NNT of $10$ signifies that, on average, a clinician must treat $10$ patients with the integrated dual-diagnosis program for a period of $6$ months to prevent one psychiatric hospitalization that would have occurred if those same $10$ patients had received usual care. In a resource-constrained environment, this metric provides crucial information for decision-making. When treatment slots are limited, administrators can quantify the public health impact: for every $10$ slots dedicated to this integrated treatment, one costly and clinically severe event (hospitalization) is expected to be averted. This directly addresses the scarcity of inpatient bed-days by providing a quantitative measure of how an outpatient intervention can reduce the burden on inpatient facilities.
