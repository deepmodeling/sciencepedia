The clinical objective is to target a moderate intensity that corresponds to a fraction $0.60$ of heart rate reserve, a level commonly used in trials testing exercise efficacy in depressive disorders.

It is a well-constructed, scientifically sound problem that tests the application of physiological and pharmacological principles to a practical clinical case.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task requires two parts: first, to compute the Target Heart Rate (THR) range as specified, and second, to evaluate the most appropriate method for monitoring exercise intensity in this patient.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the THR Range**\n\nThe THR range is calculated using the Heart Rate Reserve (HRR) method, commonly known as the Karvonen formula:\n$$ \\text{THR} = (\\text{HR}_{\\text{max}} - \\text{HR}_{\\text{rest}}) \\times \\% \\text{intensity} + \\text{HR}_{\\text{rest}} $$\nThe problem specifies using the age-predicted maximal heart rate (HR$_{\\text{max, pred}}$) for this calculation.\n\nGiven:\n-   $\\text{HR}_{\\text{rest}} = 58\\ \\mathrm{bpm}$\n-   $\\text{HR}_{\\text{max, pred}} = 190\\ \\mathrm{bpm}$\n-   Intensity band = $50\\%$ to $70\\%$ (or $0.50$ to $0.70$)\n\nFirst, calculate the Heart Rate Reserve (HRR):\n$$ \\text{HRR} = \\text{HR}_{\\text{max, pred}} - \\text{HR}_{\\text{rest}} = 190\\ \\mathrm{bpm} - 58\\ \\mathrm{bpm} = 132\\ \\mathrm{bpm} $$\n\nNext, calculate the lower and upper bounds of the THR range:\n-   Lower bound (at $50\\%$ intensity):\n    $$ \\text{THR}_{\\text{lower}} = (132 \\times 0.50) + 58 = 66 + 58 = 124\\ \\mathrm{bpm} $$\n-   Upper bound (at $70\\%$ intensity):\n    $$ \\text{THR}_{\\text{upper}} = (132 \\times 0.70) + 58 = 92.4 + 58 = 150.4\\ \\mathrm{bpm} $$\n\nTherefore, the THR range computed based on the given parameters is approximately $124$–$150\\ \\mathrm{bpm}$.\n\n**Part 2: Physiological Analysis and Selection of Approach**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the patient's use of metoprolol, a $\\beta_1$-adrenergic receptor antagonist. We must analyze its effect on the validity of the two intensity-monitoring methods.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Principles**: Exercise intensity is a measure of a physiological stress, quantified by the rate of metabolic energy expenditure. The rate of oxygen consumption ($\\dot{V}\\text{O}_2$) is the gold standard measure. According to the Fick principle, $\\dot{V}\\text{O}_2 = \\text{Q} \\times (\\text{C}_{\\text{a}}\\text{O}_2 - \\text{C}_{\\text{v}}\\text{O}_2)$, where $\\text{Q}$ is cardiac output. Cardiac output is the product of heart rate (HR) and stroke volume (SV), so $\\dot{V}\\text{O}_2 \\propto \\text{HR} \\times \\text{SV}$.\n    In unmedicated individuals, HR increases linearly with workload and $\\dot{V}\\text{O}_2$ over a wide range, making it a reliable proxy for exercise intensity.\n\n2.  **Pharmacology of $\\beta$-Blockade**: $\\beta_1$-adrenergic receptors in the heart mediate increases in heart rate (positive chronotropy) and contractility (positive inotropy) in response to sympathetic stimulation (e.g., during exercise). Metoprolol blocks these receptors.\n    -   **Effect on HR**: It blunts the chronotropic response to exercise. This means that for any given absolute workload (e.g., watts on a cycle ergometer), the patient's heart rate will be significantly lower than it would be without the medication.\n    -   **Effect on HR$_{\\text{max}}$**: Consequently, the patient's true maximal heart rate is also significantly reduced. The age-predicted formula, HR$_{\\text{max, pred}} = 220 - \\text{age}$, is empirically derived for the general, unmedicated population and is therefore **invalid** for this patient. The patient's actual HR$_{\\text{max}}$ is unknown but is certainly much lower than $190\\ \\mathrm{bpm}$.\n\n3.  **Evaluation of the THR Method**: Since the calculation of the THR range ($124$–$150\\ \\mathrm{bpm}$) was based on a fallacious HR$_{\\text{max, pred}}$, this range is not physiologically meaningful for prescribing moderate intensity. Attempting to reach this HR could either be impossible or force the patient into a much higher, possibly unsafe, intensity zone (e.g., vigorous to maximal effort). Therefore, relying on this calculated THR is inappropriate and potentially hazardous.\n\n4.  **Evaluation of the RPE Method**: The Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale (e.g., Borg $6$–$20$) is a subjective measure of the overall sense of effort. It integrates afferent feedback from working muscles and the cardiorespiratory system, as well as central command signals. Extensive research has shown that the relationship between RPE and the percentage of maximal oxygen consumption ($\\%\\dot{V}\\text{O}_{2\\text{max}}$)—the true measure of relative intensity—is remarkably stable, even in the presence of $\\beta$-blockade. While the heart rate at an RPE of $13$ is lower on a $\\beta$-blocker, the physiological strain (relative to the patient's altered maximum capacity) represented by that RPE remains consistent. An RPE of $12$–$14$ (\"somewhat hard\") reliably corresponds to a moderate intensity training zone. The \"talk test\" (being able to speak in phrases but not sing) is a practical and valid corollary for the ventilatory threshold, which typically occurs within the moderate-intensity domain.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: For a patient on a $\\beta$-blocker, RPE is the superior method for guiding day-to-day exercise intensity. Heart rate-based methods become unreliable unless they are re-calibrated by directly measuring the patient's HR$_{\\text{max}}$ on the medication, typically via a maximal graded exercise test (GXT).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Prioritize the THR calculated from age-predicted formulas; RPE is too subjective to guide intensity in a patient on $\\beta$-blockers.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The THR calculated from an age-predicted HR$_{\\text{max}}$ is invalid and unreliable due to the chronotropic blunting effect of the $\\beta$-blocker. Conversely, RPE is well-established as a valid and reliable guide to relative exercise intensity in this population, precisely because it is not dependent on the absolute heart rate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Prioritize RPE $12$–$14$ and corroborate with the talk test; use THR only after recalibrating with a measured maximal heart rate on the current medication (for example, via a graded exercise test), rather than relying on age-predicted THR.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with the physiological analysis. It correctly identifies RPE as the primary tool and the talk test as a useful adjunct. It also correctly specifies the only condition under which THR would become valid: recalibration based on a directly measured, on-medication HR$_{\\text{max}}$. This represents the clinical best practice.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Increase the calculated THR band by $10$–$20\\ \\mathrm{bpm}$ to counteract $\\beta$-blocker–induced bradycardia and ensure adequate training stimulus.**\nThis is dangerously incorrect. The $\\beta$-blocker lowers the entire heart rate curve, including the maximum. The calculated THR is already likely too high. Artificially inflating it further would prescribe an even more excessive and potentially unattainable target, dramatically increasing the risk of overexertion. To adjust for $\\beta$-blockade, any HR target would need to be *lowered*, not increased.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Prescribe intensity solely as a percentage of age-predicted maximal heart rate because $\\beta$-blockers do not meaningfully alter the relationship between heart rate and external workload at moderate intensities.**\nThe premise of this statement is false. $\\beta$-blockers fundamentally and significantly alter the relationship between heart rate and workload at *all* intensities (from rest to maximal). They cause a downward shift of the HR-versus-workload curve. Therefore, any prescription based on a standard HR-workload relationship is invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4710626"}]}
