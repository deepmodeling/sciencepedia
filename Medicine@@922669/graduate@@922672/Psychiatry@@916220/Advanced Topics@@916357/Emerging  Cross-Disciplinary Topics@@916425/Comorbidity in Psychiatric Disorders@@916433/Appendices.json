Let PTSD be the exposure and AUD be the outcome.

The probability of not having AUD given the presence of PTSD, $P(\\text{No AUD} | \\text{PTSD})$, is estimated by the proportion $\\frac{b}{a+b}$.\nThus, the odds are:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{exposed}} = \\frac{a / (a+b)}{b / (a+b)} = \\frac{a}{b}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the odds of the outcome (AUD) among the unexposed group (individuals without PTSD):\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{unexposed}} = \\frac{P(\\text{AUD} | \\text{No PTSD})}{P(\\text{No AUD} | \\text{No PTSD})}\n$$\nThe probability of having AUD given the absence of PTSD, $P(\\text{AUD} | \\text{No PTSD})$, is estimated by $\\frac{c}{c+d}$. The probability of not having AUD given the absence of PTSD, $P(\\text{No AUD} | \\text{No PTSD})$, is estimated by $\\frac{d}{c+d}$.\nThus, the odds are:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{unexposed}} = \\frac{c / (c+d)}{d / (c+d)} = \\frac{c}{d}\n$$\n\nThe odds ratio (OR) is defined as the ratio of the odds of the outcome in the exposed group to the odds of the outcome in the unexposed group.\n$$\n\\text{OR} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{exposed}}}{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{unexposed}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above, we obtain the closed-form expression for the odds ratio:\n$$\n\\text{OR} = \\frac{a/b}{c/d} = \\frac{ad}{bc}\n$$\nThis expression, also known as the cross-product ratio, is the required formula.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the odds ratio using the given data: $a=140$, $b=260$, $c=192$, and $d=1408$.\n$$\n\\text{OR} = \\frac{(140)(1408)}{(260)(192)} = \\frac{197120}{49920} \\approx 3.9487179...\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the numerical answer to four significant figures.

An odds ratio of $1$ indicates that the odds of the outcome are identical in the exposed and unexposed groups, implying no association. An odds ratio greater than $1$ signifies a positive association between the exposure and the outcome. In this specific context, an odds ratio of approximately $3.949$ means that the odds of having AUD are nearly $4$ times higher for individuals with PTSD than for individuals without PTSD in this study population. This suggests a strong positive association between PTSD and AUD, where the presence of PTSD increases the likelihood of concurrent AUD.

This quantity is the conditional probability $P(BD | T^+)$. The most direct method for this calculation is Bayes' theorem.\n\nBayes' theorem states:\n$$\nP(BD | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | BD) P(BD)}{P(T^+)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result, which can be expanded using the law of total probability with respect to the presence or absence of Bipolar Disorder:\n$$\nP(T^+) = P(T^+ | BD) P(BD) + P(T^+ | BD^c) P(BD^c)\n$$\nwhere $BD^c$ represents the event that the patient does not have Bipolar Disorder.\n\nSubstituting the expanded form of the denominator into Bayes' theorem gives the full expression we will use:\n$$\nP(BD | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | BD) P(BD)}{P(T^+ | BD) P(BD) + P(T^+ | BD^c) P(BD^c)}\n$$\n\nWe must now extract and define each term from the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Prior Probability, $P(BD)$**: The problem provides the base rate of BD in the specified clinic population as $0.20$.\n    $$\n    P(BD) = 0.20\n    $$\n    The probability of not having BD is therefore:\n    $$\n    P(BD^c) = 1 - P(BD) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80\n    $$\n\n2.  **Sensitivity, $P(T^+ | BD)$**: Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present.
