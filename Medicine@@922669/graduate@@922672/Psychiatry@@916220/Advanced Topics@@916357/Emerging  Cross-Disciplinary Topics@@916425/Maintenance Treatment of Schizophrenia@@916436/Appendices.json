Assume the following:\n\n- The relapse risk under continuation is $0.25$ over one year.\n- The relapse risk under discontinuation is $0.55$ over one year.\n- Outcomes across individuals are independent, and each individual’s relapse probability equals the arm-specific risk.\n- The expected number of relapses in a cohort of size $n$ in a given arm equals $n$ times the arm-specific risk, by the linearity of expectation.\n\nUsing only these foundational definitions from probability and epidemiology, derive the cohort size $n$ such that the expected number of relapses prevented by continuation compared with discontinuation equals exactly one over the one-year horizon.

This quantity is equivalent to the Number Needed to Treat (NNT).\n\nFirst, let us formalize the given information using mathematical notation. Let $R_C$ be the relapse risk in the continuation (treatment) arm and $R_D$ be the relapse risk in the discontinuation (control) arm. The problem provides the following values for the one-year study period:\n-   $R_C = 0.25$\n-   $R_D = 0.55$\n\nThe problem states that for a cohort of size $n$ in a given arm, the expected number of relapses is the product of $n$ and the arm-specific risk. This is a direct application of the linearity of expectation for a sum of Bernoulli random variables.\n\nLet $E_C$ be the expected number of relapses in a cohort of size $n$ in the continuation arm.\n$$E_C = n \\times R_C$$\n\nLet $E_D$ be the expected number of relapses in a cohort of size $n$ in the discontinuation arm.\n$$E_D = n \\times R_D$$\n\nThe \"expected number of relapses prevented by continuation compared with discontinuation\" is the difference between the expected number of relapses in the higher-risk (discontinuation) arm and the lower-risk (continuation) arm.

This exercise [@problem_id:4724422] extends the concept of quantifying treatment effects by introducing the Number Needed to Harm ($NNH$) alongside the $NNT$.

We can proceed with a formal derivation of the requested quantities.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in quantifying the absolute effect of a treatment over a fixed time horizon. The metrics Number Needed to Treat (NNT) and Number Needed to Harm (NNH) are derived from the concepts of Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) and Absolute Risk Increase (ARI), respectively. These metrics compare the probabilities of an event occurring in the treatment group versus the control (placebo) group.\n\nLet us define the following probabilities based on the provided data for the $12$-month period:\n- Let $P_{R|T}$ be the probability of relapse in the treatment (continuation) arm. The problem states this is $20\\%$, so $P_{R|T} = 0.20$.\n- Let $P_{R|P}$ be the probability of relapse in the placebo arm. The problem states this is $50\\%$, so $P_{R|P} = 0.50$.\n- Let $P_{M|T}$ be the probability of incident metabolic syndrome in the treatment (continuation) arm. The problem states this is $10\\%$, so $P_{M|T} = 0.10$.\n- Let $P_{M|P}$ be the probability of incident metabolic syndrome in the placebo arm. The problem states this is $5\\%$, so $P_{M|P} = 0.05$.\n\nThe assumption of randomization ensuring exchangeability implies that the observed event proportions are valid estimates of the counterfactual risks, meaning the difference in outcomes between the arms can be attributed to the treatment itself.\n\nFirst, we derive the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) to prevent one relapse. Relapse prevention is a beneficial outcome. The effectiveness of the treatment in preventing relapse is measured by the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR). The ARR quantifies the absolute difference in the risk of the adverse event (relapse) between the placebo group and the treatment group.\n\nThe ARR is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{ARR} = P_{R|P} - P_{R|T}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\text{ARR} = 0.50 - 0.20 = 0.30\n$$\nAs a fraction, this is $\\frac{3}{10}$. The ARR represents the proportion of the population that is spared the adverse outcome (relapse) as a direct result of receiving the treatment instead of the placebo. An ARR of $0.30$ means that for every $100$ patients treated with the antipsychotic for $12$ months, $30$ relapses are prevented compared to if they had received a placebo.\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is the reciprocal of the ARR. It represents the average number of patients who need to be treated for the specified time period to prevent one additional adverse outcome.\n$$\n\\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{\\text{ARR}} = \\frac{1}{P_{R|P} - P_{R|T}}\n$$\nUsing our calculated ARR:\n$$\n\\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{0.30} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{10}} = \\frac{10}{3}\n$$\n\nSecond, we derive the Number Needed to Harm (NNH) to cause one additional case of metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is an adverse outcome (harm) attributable to the treatment. The excess risk of this harm due to the treatment is measured by the Absolute Risk Increase (ARI). The ARI quantifies the absolute difference in the risk of the harmful event (metabolic syndrome) between the treatment group and the placebo group.\n\nThe ARI is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{ARI} = P_{M|T} - P_{M|P}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\text{ARI} = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05\n$$\nAs a fraction, this is $\\frac{5}{100} = \\frac{1}{20}$. The ARI represents the proportion of the population that experiences the adverse outcome (metabolic syndrome) as a direct result of receiving the treatment instead of the placebo. An ARI of $0.05$ means that for every $100$ patients treated, there are $5$ additional cases of metabolic syndrome compared to the placebo group over $12$ months.\n\nThe Number Needed to Harm (NNH) is the reciprocal of the ARI. It represents the average number of patients who need to be treated for the specified time period for one additional harmful outcome to occur.\n$$\n\\text{NNH} = \\frac{1}{\\text{ARI}} = \\frac{1}{P_{M|T} - P_{M|P}}\n$$\nUsing our calculated ARI:\n$$\n\\text{NNH} = \\frac{1}{0.05} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{20}} = 20\n$$\nThe problem requires expressing the final values for NNT and NNH as a single row matrix, ordered as $(\\text{NNT}\\ \\text{NNH})$.

The treatment plan is to transition to haloperidol decanoate Long-Acting Injectable (LAI) while maintaining therapeutic continuity during the first injection cycle. Use the following empirically established and widely accepted clinical pharmacokinetic facts and constraints:\n\n- Haloperidol decanoate has a terminal half-life of approximately $21$ days in typical adult patients.\n- A conservative conversion multiple from stabilized oral daily dose to initial LAI decanoate dose is $10$.\n- The maximum recommended amount for the very first haloperidol decanoate injection to reduce early adverse events is $100$ milligrams (if the calculated amount exceeds this, the remainder is scheduled separately; however, in this case, the conservative multiple will not exceed the cap).\n- The injection interval for maintenance is $28$ days for the decanoate preparation.\n\nStarting from the principle that maintenance therapy seeks to match average systemic exposure between oral therapy and LAI, and that accumulation of the LAI contribution can be approximated using first-order elimination dynamics, determine:\n\n1.

All necessary parameters are provided, and the questions are specific and formalizable.\n\nThe task is to determine two quantities: the initial dose of haloperidol decanoate Long-Acting Injectable (LAI) and the duration of oral haloperidol supplementation.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Initial Haloperidol Decanoate Dose**\n\nThe problem provides a set of rules for calculating the initial dose.

The actual initial dose, $D_{LAI,initial}$, is the lesser of the calculated dose and the maximum allowed dose.\n$$D_{LAI,initial} = \\min(D_{LAI,calc}, D_{max,1})$$\nIn this case, $D_{LAI,calc} = 60 \\text{ mg}$. Since $60 \\text{ mg} \\le 100 \\text{ mg}$, the calculated dose does not exceed the cap.\nTherefore, the appropriate initial dose of haloperidol decanoate is $60 \\text{ mg}$. The problem requests rounding to two significant figures. The number $60$ can be represented as $6.0 \\times 10^1$, which has two significant figures.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Oral Supplementation Duration**\n\nThe oral supplementation duration, $t_{supp}$, is defined as the time required for the LAI contribution to reach $50\\%$ of its eventual steady-state level. The accumulation of the drug from the LAI formulation is stated to follow first-order elimination dynamics.\n\nFor a drug that accumulates according to first-order kinetics, the amount of drug in the body (or its plasma concentration) at time $t$ after the start of therapy, $A(t)$, approaches its steady-state level, $A_{ss}$, according to the following equation:\n$$A(t) = A_{ss} (1 - \\exp(-k_e t))$$\nwhere $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\nThe fraction of the steady-state level achieved at time $t$ is given by:\n$$f(t) = \\frac{A(t)}{A_{ss}} = 1 - \\exp(-k_e t)$$\n\nWe need to find the time $t_{supp}$ at which this fraction is $50\\%$, or $0.50$.\n$$0.50 = 1 - \\exp(-k_e t_{supp})$$\n\nSolving for $t_{supp}$:\n$$\\exp(-k_e t_{supp}) = 1 - 0.50 = 0.50$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(\\exp(-k_e t_{supp})) = \\ln(0.50)$$\n$$-k_e t_{supp} = \\ln(0.50) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2)$$\n$$k_e t_{supp} = \\ln(2)$$\n$$t_{supp} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_e}$$\n\nThis expression is the definition of the drug's half-life, $t_{1/2}$. The relationship between the half-life and the elimination rate constant is:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_e}$$\nTherefore, the time required to reach $50\\%$ of steady-state is exactly one half-life of the drug.\n$$t_{supp} = t_{1/2}$$\n\nThe problem states that the terminal half-life of haloperidol decanoate is approximately $21$ days.\n- $t_{1/2} = 21 \\text{ days}$.\n\nThus, the required duration for oral supplementation is $21$ days. This value, $21$, already has two significant figures.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix containing the initial dose in milligrams ($60$) and the supplementation duration in days ($21$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 60 & 21 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4724451"}]}
