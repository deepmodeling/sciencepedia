It is scientifically grounded, as the stated incidence of postpartum psychosis ($1.5$ per $1000$ deliveries) is consistent with empirical data in psychiatric epidemiology. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information, including the total number of deliveries $N$ and the incidence proportion, along with a clear assumption of independence between events. The terminology is objective and standard within the fields of biostatistics and epidemiology. The request to derive the expectation from first principles using indicator variables provides a clear and logical path to a unique solution.\n\nWe are tasked with deriving the expected annual number of postpartum psychosis cases from first principles.\n\nThe total number of deliveries in the year is given as $N = 5000$.\nThe incidence of postpartum psychosis is given as $1.5$ per $1000$ deliveries. According to the problem statement, this incidence proportion represents the probability, $p$, that a single delivery results in a case of postpartum psychosis.\nTherefore, we can write the probability $p$ as:\n$$p = \\frac{1.5}{1000} = 0.0015$$\n\nThe problem instructs us to represent each delivery as an indicator random variable. Let $I_i$ be the indicator random variable for the $i$-th delivery, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$. The variable $I_i$ is defined as:\n$$\nI_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1  \\text{if postpartum psychosis occurs for delivery } i \\\\\n0  \\text{if postpartum psychosis does not occur for delivery } i\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe outcome for each delivery is a Bernoulli trial with probability of success (occurrence of postpartum psychosis) equal to $p$. The probability distribution for $I_i$ is therefore:\n$$P(I_i = 1) = p$$\n$$P(I_i = 0) = 1 - p$$\n\nThe total number of postpartum psychosis cases in the year, which we can denote by the random variable $X$, is the sum of the outcomes for all $N$ individual deliveries. Thus, $X$ is the sum of all the indicator variables:\n$$X = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} I_i$$\n\nWe are asked to find the expected annual number of cases, which is the expectation of $X$, denoted $E[X]$.\nUsing the property of linearity of expectation, the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations. This property holds regardless of whether the variables are independent, although the problem states independence as an assumption.\n$$E[X] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} I_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[I_i]$$\n\nNext, we must find the expectation of a single indicator variable, $E[I_i]$. By the definition of expected value for a discrete random variable, we have:\n$$E[I_i] = \\sum_{k} k \\cdot P(I_i = k)$$\nFor our indicator variable, the possible values of $k$ are $1$ and $0$. So, the expectation is:\n$$E[I_i] = (1 \\cdot P(I_i = 1)) + (0 \\cdot P(I_i = 0))$$\nSubstituting the probabilities:\n$$E[I_i] = (1 \\cdot p) + (0 \\cdot (1-p)) = p$$\nThus, the expected value of each indicator variable is simply the probability of the event occurring.\n\nNow, we substitute this result back into the expression for $E[X]$:\n$$E[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p$$\nSince $p$ is a constant probability for all deliveries, the sum consists of $N$ identical terms:\n$$E[X] = N \\cdot p$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value using the given data:\n$$N = 5000$$\n$$p = 0.0015$$\n$$E[X] = 5000 \\times 0.0015 = 7.5$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final number to three significant figures. The number $7.5$ has two significant figures. To express it with three significant figures, we add a trailing zero.\n$$E[X] = 7.50$$\nThis value represents the expected annual number of postpartum psychosis cases in this health system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.50}$$", "id": "4742789"}, {"introduction": "While population-level data provides a crucial baseline, clinical practice demands a personalized approach to risk. This exercise demonstrates how to move from a general pretest probability to a more accurate, individualized posttest probability using a powerful tool from evidence-based medicine: the likelihood ratio.

We will proceed with the calculation as requested.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in applying Bayes' theorem, which can be elegantly handled using odds and likelihood ratios. The relationship between probability $P$ and odds $O$ is fundamental. Odds are defined as the ratio of the probability of an event occurring to the probability of it not occurring.\n\nLet $P$ be the probability of an event. The corresponding odds, $O$, are given by the formula:\n$$O = \\frac{P}{1-P}$$\nConversely, the probability can be recovered from the odds using:\n$$P = \\frac{O}{1+O}$$\n\nA likelihood ratio, $LR$, updates the pretest (or prior) odds to the posttest (or posterior) odds. For a positive finding, denoted by the subscript '$+$', the formula is:\n$$O_{\\text{post}} = O_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR_{+}$$\n\nThe problem requires a three-step process:\n1.  Convert the pretest probability, $P_{\\text{pre}}$, to pretest odds, $O_{\\text{pre}}$.\n2.  Calculate the posttest odds, $O_{\\text{post}}$, using the given positive likelihood ratio, $LR_{+}$.\n3.  Convert the posttest odds, $O_{\\text{post}}$, back to the posttest probability, $P_{\\text{post}}$.\n\nFirst, we are given the pretest probability $P_{\\text{pre}} = 0.15\\%$. We must convert this from a percentage to a standard fractional representation for precise calculation.\n$$P_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{0.15}{100} = \\frac{15}{10000}$$\nThis fraction can be reduced by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $5$.\n$$P_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{15 \\div 5}{10000 \\div 5} = \\frac{3}{2000}$$\n\nNow, we convert this pretest probability to pretest odds, $O_{\\text{pre}}$.\n$$O_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{pre}}}{1 - P_{\\text{pre}}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2000}}{1 - \\frac{3}{2000}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2000}}{\\frac{2000}{2000} - \\frac{3}{2000}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2000}}{\\frac{1997}{2000}} = \\frac{3}{1997}$$\n\nNext, we use the provided positive likelihood ratio, $LR_{+} = 4$, to calculate the posttest odds, $O_{\\text{post}}$.\n$$O_{\\text{post}} = O_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR_{+} = \\frac{3}{1997} \\times 4 = \\frac{12}{1997}$$\n\nFinally, we convert these posttest odds back into a posttest probability, $P_{\\text{post}}$.\n$$P_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{O_{\\text{post}}}{1 + O_{\\text{post}}} = \\frac{\\frac{12}{1997}}{1 + \\frac{12}{1997}} = \\frac{\\frac{12}{1997}}{\\frac{1997}{1997} + \\frac{12}{1997}} = \\frac{\\frac{12}{1997}}{\\frac{1997+12}{1997}} = \\frac{\\frac{12}{1997}}{\\frac{2009}{1997}} = \\frac{12}{2009}$$\n\nTo ensure the fraction is fully reduced, we check for common factors between the numerator, $12$, and the denominator, $2009$. The prime factors of $12$ are $2^{2} \\times 3$. The denominator $2009$ is not divisible by $2$ (it is odd) or $3$ (the sum of its digits is $11$). We can further check for prime factors of $2009$: it is not divisible by $5$, but it is divisible by $7$: $2009 = 7 \\times 287$. Furthermore, $287 = 7 \\times 41$. So, the prime factorization of $2009$ is $7^{2} \\times 41$. Since the numerator and denominator share no prime factors, the fraction $\\frac{12}{2009}$ is in its simplest form.\n\nFor the purpose of clinical counseling, this risk increase can be interpreted. The initial risk was $P_{\\text{pre}} = 0.15\\%$, which is roughly $1$ in $667$. The updated risk is $P_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{12}{2009} \\approx 0.00597$, or approximately $0.6\\%$. This is roughly a risk of $1$ in $167$. Therefore, the presence of a first-degree family history of bipolar disorder results in a fourfold increase in the patient's risk of developing postpartum psychosis. While the absolute risk remains low (less than $1\\%$), this is a clinically significant change that elevates the risk from a very low baseline to a level that warrants increased vigilance and proactive management planning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{12}{2009}}$$", "id": "4742767"}, {"introduction": "Identifying an individual at high risk for postpartum psychosis immediately raises the question of prevention.
