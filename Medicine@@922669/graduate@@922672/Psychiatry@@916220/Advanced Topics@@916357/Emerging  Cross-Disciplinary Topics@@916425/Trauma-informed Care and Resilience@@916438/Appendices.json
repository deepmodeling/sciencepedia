The problem statement provides all necessary data for a standard application of Bayesian probability in a medical diagnostics context. The given values for prevalence ($0.20$), sensitivity ($0.85$), and specificity ($0.90$) are realistic for a clinical setting. The problem is self-contained, logically consistent, and asks for a derivation and calculation based on fundamental theorems of probability, namely Bayes’ theorem and the law of total probability. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual has clinically significant PTSD-related symptoms, and let $D^c$ be the complement event, that the individual does not. Let $T$ be the event that the screener result is positive, and $T^c$ be the event that the result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe prevalence of the condition is $P(D) = 0.20$.\nThe sensitivity of the screener is the probability of a positive test given the presence of the condition: $P(T|D) = 0.85$.\nThe specificity of the screener is the probability of a negative test given the absence of the condition: $P(T^c|D^c) = 0.90$.\n\nFrom these given probabilities, we can derive complementary probabilities:\nThe probability of not having the condition is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\nThe false negative rate is the probability of a negative test given the presence of the condition: $P(T^c|D) = 1 - P(T|D) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\nThe false positive rate is the probability of a positive test given the absence of the condition: $P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\nThe quantities to be derived are the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and the Negative Predictive Value (NPV).\nPPV is the probability that an individual has the condition given a positive test result, defined as $P(D|T)$.\nNPV is the probability that an individual does not have the condition given a negative test result, defined as $P(D^c|T^c)$.\n\nWe will derive the expressions for PPV and NPV using Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability.

Conversion of the final odds into the one-year relapse probability.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Allostatic Load Index (ALI)**\nThe ALI is a count-based score. For each of the five biomarkers, a value of $1$ is assigned if the patient's measurement falls within the high-risk range, and a value of $0$ is assigned otherwise. The ALI is the sum of these scores.\n\nThe patient's values are compared to the high-risk thresholds:\n-   Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP): The patient's value is $145$ mmHg.
