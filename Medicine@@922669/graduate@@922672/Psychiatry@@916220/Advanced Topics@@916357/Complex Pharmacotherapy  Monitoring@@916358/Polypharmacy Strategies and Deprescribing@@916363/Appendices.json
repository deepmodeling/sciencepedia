This first practice problem explores a classic pharmacokinetic interaction, where one drug inhibits the metabolism of another, leading to increased exposure and potential toxicity. By calculating the impact of a CYP450 inhibitor on quetiapine levels, you will practice a fundamental skill for predicting and mitigating the risks associated with adding new medications to a patient's regimen [@problem_id:4741457].", "problem": "A psychiatrist is managing a patient stabilized on quetiapine for bipolar disorder. Quetiapine is predominantly cleared by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). The patient is started on a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor that reduces quetiapine clearance by 40 percent. Assume the following foundational pharmacokinetic conditions hold: quetiapine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics within the therapeutic range, bioavailability $F$ is unchanged by the inhibitor, the dosing interval $\\tau$ remains constant, and steady state is achieved.\n\nLet the baseline dose per dosing interval be $D$ and the baseline clearance be $CL_{0}$. After the inhibitor is started, clearance becomes $CL_{1} = (1 - 0.40)\\,CL_{0} = 0.60\\,CL_{0}$. The prescriber implements a dose reduction of 25 percent, so the new dose per interval is $D_{1} = 0.75\\,D$.\n\nUse only the following widely accepted relationships for drugs with linear pharmacokinetics at steady state:\n- The average steady-state concentration over a dosing interval satisfies $C_{ss,\\mathrm{avg}} = \\dfrac{F\\,(D/\\tau)}{CL}$.\n- The area under the concentration–time curve over one dosing interval satisfies $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau} = \\dfrac{F\\,D}{CL}$.\n\nTasks:\n1. Derive, from the stated relationships, how a fractional change in clearance and dose scales $C_{ss,\\mathrm{avg}}$ and $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau}$ relative to baseline.\n2. Specialize your result to this case to compute the ratio $R$ of post-inhibitor, dose-reduced exposure to baseline exposure, where exposure is represented equivalently by $C_{ss,\\mathrm{avg}}$ or by $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau}$ under the stated assumptions. That is, compute\n$$\nR \\equiv \\frac{C_{ss,\\mathrm{avg}}^{(\\text{after, reduced})}}{C_{ss,\\mathrm{avg}}^{(\\text{baseline})}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau}^{(\\text{after, reduced})}}{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau}^{(\\text{baseline})}}.\n$$\n3. For clinical context: suppose oversedation risk is considered adequately mitigated if the exposure increase relative to baseline does not exceed $0.20$ (that is, $R \\leq 1.20$). Based on your computed $R$, state in your solution whether the 25 percent dose reduction adequately mitigates oversedation risk, with a one-sentence justification grounded in your calculation.\n\nProvide as your final answer only the exact unitless value of $R$ (no rounding).", "solution": "The analysis begins with the foundational relationships for steady-state pharmacokinetics provided in the problem statement. The average steady-state concentration, $C_{ss,\\mathrm{avg}}$, and the area under the concentration-time curve over one dosing interval, $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau}$, are given by:\n$$C_{ss,\\mathrm{avg}} = \\frac{F\\,(D/\\tau)}{CL}$$\n$$\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau} = \\frac{F\\,D}{CL}$$\nHere, $F$ is the bioavailability, $D$ is the dose per dosing interval $\\tau$, and $CL$ is the drug clearance. The problem states that for the purposes of calculating the ratio of exposures, these two metrics are equivalent, as is evident from their proportionality ($C_{ss,\\mathrm{avg}} = \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau} / \\tau$).\n\nLet the baseline state be denoted by the subscript $0$ and the post-intervention state (inhibitor added, dose reduced) by the subscript $1$.\nThe baseline exposure, represented by $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau}^{(\\text{baseline})}$, is:\n$$\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau}^{(\\text{baseline})} = \\frac{F\\,D_0}{CL_0}$$\nwhere $D_0 = D$ is the initial dose and $CL_0$ is the baseline clearance.\n\nThe new state involves a change in both clearance and dose. The clearance is reduced by $40\\%$, so the new clearance, $CL_1$, is $60\\%$ of the baseline clearance:\n$$CL_1 = (1 - 0.40) CL_0 = 0.60\\,CL_0$$\nThe dose is reduced by $25\\%$, so the new dose, $D_1$, is $75\\%$ of the baseline dose:\n$$D_1 = (1 - 0.25) D_0 = 0.75\\,D_0$$\nThe bioavailability $F$ and dosing interval $\\tau$ are stated to be constant. The exposure in the new state, $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau}^{(\\text{after, reduced})}$, is therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau}^{(\\text{after, reduced})} = \\frac{F\\,D_1}{CL_1}$$\n\nThe first task is to derive a general expression for how a fractional change in clearance and dose scales the exposure. We define the ratio $R$ as the new exposure divided by the baseline exposure. Using the $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau}$ expressions, this ratio is:\n$$R = \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau}^{(\\text{after, reduced})}}{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau}^{(\\text{baseline})}} = \\frac{F\\,D_1/CL_1}{F\\,D_0/CL_0}$$\nThe bioavailability $F$ cancels, yielding:\n$$R = \\frac{D_1/CL_1}{D_0/CL_0} = \\left(\\frac{D_1}{D_0}\\right) \\left(\\frac{CL_0}{CL_1}\\right)$$\nThis equation shows that the exposure ratio scales directly with the dose ratio and inversely with the clearance ratio. This completes the first task.\n\nThe second task is to compute the specific value of $R$ for this case. We substitute the given fractional changes into the derived scaling law:\n$$R = \\left(\\frac{0.75\\,D_0}{D_0}\\right) \\left(\\frac{CL_0}{0.60\\,CL_0}\\right)$$\nThe variables $D_0$ and $CL_0$ cancel out, leaving a purely numerical calculation:\n$$R = \\frac{0.75}{0.60} = \\frac{75}{60} = \\frac{5 \\times 15}{4 \\times 15} = \\frac{5}{4}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$R = 1.25$$\n\nThe third task requires a clinical interpretation. The new exposure is $1.25$ times the baseline exposure, which corresponds to a $25\\%$ increase. The problem states that oversedation risk is considered adequately mitigated if the exposure increase does not exceed $0.20$ (i.e., $R \\leq 1.20$). Since the calculated ratio is $R=1.25$, which is greater than the threshold of $1.20$, the dose reduction is not adequate. The 25 percent dose reduction is insufficient to mitigate the risk of oversedation because the resulting drug exposure is $1.25$ times the baseline, exceeding the maximum acceptable relative exposure of $1.20$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.25}$$", "id": "4741457"}, {"introduction": "Beyond pharmacokinetics, rational deprescribing decisions hinge on a careful evaluation of clinical risks and benefits.

A pragmatic augmentation trial compares adding lithium to ongoing antidepressant therapy versus continuing antidepressant therapy without lithium over a six-month horizon. The primary clinical benefit is response within the six-month period, observed with probability $0.55$ under lithium augmentation and $0.40$ without lithium. The clinically relevant adverse outcome is nephrotoxicity within the same six-month period, observed with probability $0.03$ under lithium augmentation and $0.01$ without lithium.\n\nStarting from fundamental probability definitions for event risks and differences, derive the following quantities without using any pre-stated shortcut formulas:\n- The absolute risk reduction (ARR) for response with lithium augmentation relative to no lithium.\n- The number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve one additional response, defined in terms of the ARR.\n- The absolute risk increase (ARI) for nephrotoxicity with lithium augmentation relative to no lithium.\n- The number needed to harm (NNH) for nephrotoxicity, defined in terms of the ARI.\n\nTo incorporate deprescribing considerations, the team applies a severity weight $s=3$ reflecting the relative disutility of nephrotoxicity compared to the utility of achieving response. They follow a decision rule that favors continuing lithium augmentation when the rate of benefit exceeds the severity-weighted rate of harm over the six-month horizon; otherwise, they deprescribe.

However, in this context, the problem asks for the risk reduction for *response*, a beneficial outcome. This is more formally known as the Absolute Benefit Increase (ABI), but we will use the term ARR as specified. It represents the absolute difference in the probability of the beneficial outcome between the treatment and control groups.\n\nThe ARR is derived by subtracting the probability of response in the control group from the probability of response in the treatment group:\n$$\nARR = P(R|L) - P(R|L^c)\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nARR = 0.55 - 0.40 = 0.15\n$$\n\n**Number Needed to Treat (NNT)**\nThe NNT is defined as the average number of patients who must be treated to achieve one additional beneficial outcome compared to the control group.
