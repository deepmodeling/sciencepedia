A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the concept of mass balance at steady state. At steady state, the rate at which the drug enters the systemic circulation is exactly equal to the rate at which it is eliminated from the body.\n\nThe rate of drug administration into the systemic circulation, or the rate of input (Rate In), is the bioavailable dose ($F \\times Dose$) averaged over the dosing interval ($\\tau$).\n$$ \\text{Rate In} = \\frac{F \\times Dose}{\\tau} $$\n\nThe rate of drug elimination from the body (Rate Out) is defined as the product of the total body clearance ($CL$) and the plasma drug concentration. For a multiple-dosing regimen at steady state, we use the average steady-state concentration ($C_{avg,ss}$).\n$$ \\text{Rate Out} = CL \\times C_{avg,ss} $$\n\nAt steady state, we equate the two rates:\n$$ \\text{Rate In} = \\text{Rate Out} $$\n$$ \\frac{F \\times Dose}{\\tau} = CL \\times C_{avg,ss} $$\n\nWe are asked to compute the total body clearance, $CL$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $CL$:\n$$ CL = \\frac{F \\times Dose}{C_{avg,ss} \\times \\tau} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this equation:\n- $F = 1$ (dimensionless)\n- $Dose = 1000$ mg\n- $C_{avg,ss} = 80$ mg/L\n- $\\tau = 24$ h\n\nSubstituting these values yields:\n$$ CL = \\frac{1 \\times 1000 \\text{ mg}}{80 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}} \\times 24 \\text{ h}} $$\n\nThe units are consistent.

In the context of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) for psychiatric stabilization, this value is critical. It quantifies the patient's individual capacity to eliminate the drug. This patient-specific clearance parameter can be used to predict the dose adjustments needed to achieve a different target plasma concentration. For instance, if a higher concentration were desired for better efficacy, the same formula ($Dose = (CL \\times C_{avg,ss,target} \\times \\tau) / F$) could be used with the calculated $CL$ to determine the new dose. Conversely, if signs of toxicity appeared, this $CL$ would inform dose reduction.

A solution will be derived and computed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe derivation begins from the fundamental principle of mass balance at steady state. At steady state ($ss$), the rate of drug administration equals the rate of drug elimination over one complete dosing interval, $\\tau$.\n\nThe amount of drug that becomes systemically available from a single oral dose $D$ is given by $F \\cdot D$, where $F$ is the bioavailability. The average rate of drug administration (Rate In) over a dosing interval $\\tau$ is:\n$$ \\text{Rate In} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{\\tau} $$\n\nThe rate of drug elimination at any time $t$ is the product of the drug clearance, $CL$, and the plasma concentration at that time, $C(t)$. For first-order elimination, $CL$ is a constant. The total amount of drug eliminated over one dosing interval at steady state is the integral of the elimination rate:\n$$ \\text{Mass Eliminated} = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} CL \\cdot C_{ss}(t) \\, dt = CL \\int_{0}^{\\tau} C_{ss}(t) \\, dt $$\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{\\tau} C_{ss}(t) \\, dt$ is the area under the concentration-time curve during one dosing interval at steady state, denoted as $AUC_{ss, \\tau}$.\nThe average rate of elimination (Rate Out) is this total mass eliminated divided by the interval $\\tau$:\n$$ \\text{Rate Out} = \\frac{CL \\cdot AUC_{ss, \\tau}}{\\tau} $$\nBy definition, the average steady-state concentration is $C_{ss, avg} = \\frac{AUC_{ss, \\tau}}{\\tau}$. Substituting this gives:\n$$ \\text{Rate Out} = CL \\cdot C_{ss, avg} $$\nAt steady state, $\\text{Rate In} = \\text{Rate Out}$:\n$$ \\frac{F \\cdot D}{\\tau} = CL \\cdot C_{ss, avg} $$\nSolving for the average steady-state concentration yields a fundamental relationship in linear pharmacokinetics:\n$$ C_{ss, avg} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL \\cdot \\tau} $$\nA key property of linear pharmacokinetics is that all steady-state concentration measures (e.g., peak, average, trough) are directly proportional to the dosing rate, $\\frac{D}{\\tau}$. This is because for a given patient and drug, the parameters $F$, $CL$, the volume of distribution ($V_d$), and the absorption and elimination rate constants ($k_a$, $k_e$) are constants. Thus, the shape of the concentration-time curve at steady state is fixed, and its magnitude scales linearly with the dose.\n\nTherefore, the trough concentration at steady state, $C_{ss, trough}$, must also be directly proportional to the dosing rate:\n$$ C_{ss, trough} \\propto \\frac{D}{\\tau} $$\nSince the dosing interval $\\tau$ is kept constant in this problem, the relationship simplifies to a direct proportionality between the trough concentration and the dose $D$:\n$$ C_{ss, trough} \\propto D $$\nThis can be expressed with a constant of proportionality, $k$:\n$$ C_{ss, trough} = k \\cdot D $$\nThe constant $k$ encapsulates all the patient- and drug-specific parameters ($F$, $CL$, $V_d$, $k_a$, $k_e$, $\\tau$) which are assumed to remain unchanged between the two dosing regimens.\n\nWe can write this relationship for both the initial regimen (subscript $1$) and the new target regimen (subscript $2$):\n$1$. $C_{ss, trough, 1} = k \\cdot D_1$\n$2$. $C_{ss, trough, 2} = k \\cdot D_2$\n\nTo find the required new dose $D_2$, we take the ratio of equation $2$ to equation $1$:\n$$ \\frac{C_{ss, trough, 2}}{C_{ss, trough, 1}} = \\frac{k \\cdot D_2}{k \\cdot D_1} = \\frac{D_2}{D_1} $$\nThis is the derived relationship required to compute the new dose. It shows that the ratio of the doses is equal to the ratio of the desired target trough concentration to the measured trough concentration.\n\nRearranging to solve for $D_2$:\n$$ D_2 = D_1 \\cdot \\frac{C_{ss, trough, 2}}{C_{ss, trough, 1}} $$\n\n### Computation\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the derived formula:\n- Initial Dose, $D_1 = 25$ $\\text{mg}$\n- Initial Trough Concentration, $C_{ss, trough, 1} = 25$ $\\text{ng}/\\text{mL}$\n- Target Trough Concentration, $C_{ss, trough, 2} = 100$ $\\text{ng}/\\text{mL}$\n\n$$ D_2 = 25 \\, \\text{mg} \\cdot \\frac{100 \\, \\text{ng/mL}}{25 \\, \\text{ng/mL}} $$\n$$ D_2 = 25 \\, \\text{mg} \\cdot 4 $$\n$$ D_2 = 100 \\, \\text{mg} $$\nThe new daily dose required is $100$ $\\text{mg}/\\text{day}$.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The input values $25$ $\\text{mg}$ and $25$ $\\text{ng}/\\text{mL}$ each have two significant figures. The target $100$ $\\text{ng}/\\text{mL}$ is reasonably interpreted as having at least two significant figures (i.e., $1.0 \\times 10^2$). The result of the calculation is exactly $100$. To express this numerical value with two significant figures, scientific notation must be used.\n\nThe number $100$ rounded to two significant figures is $100$.

The analysis will proceed.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the elimination phase in a one-compartment model with first-order kinetics is described by the monoexponential decay equation:\n$$C(t) = C_{ref} \\cdot e^{-k_e (t - t_{ref})}$$\nwhere $C(t)$ is the plasma concentration at time $t$, $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant, and $(t_{ref}, C_{ref})$ is a known reference concentration-time point.\n\nWe are given two data points on this decay curve, assuming the dose was taken as scheduled at time $t=0$ ($20{:}00$):\n- Point $1$: $(t_1, C_1) = (12 \\text{ h}, 400 \\text{ ng/mL})$\n- Point $2$: $(t_2, C_2) = (24 \\text{ h}, 140 \\text{ ng/mL})$\n\n**1. Calculate the Elimination Rate Constant ($k_e$) and Half-Life ($t_{1/2}$)**\n\nUsing the two data points, we can solve for $k_e$. Let Point $1$ be the reference point.\n$$C_2 = C_1 \\cdot e^{-k_e (t_2 - t_1)}$$\nPlugging in the values:\n$$140 \\text{ ng/mL} = (400 \\text{ ng/mL}) \\cdot e^{-k_e (24 \\text{ h} - 12 \\text{ h})}$$\n$$\\frac{140}{400} = e^{-k_e \\cdot 12 \\text{ h}}$$\n$$0.35 = e^{-12k_e}$$\nTo solve for $k_e$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(0.35) = -12 \\text{ h} \\cdot k_e$$\n$$k_e = -\\frac{\\ln(0.35)}{12 \\text{ h}} \\approx -\\frac{-1.0498}{12 \\text{ h}} \\approx 0.08748 \\text{ h}^{-1}$$\nThe elimination half-life ($t_{1/2}$) is related to $k_e$ by:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_e}$$\n$$t_{1/2} \\approx \\frac{0.6931}{0.08748 \\text{ h}^{-1}} \\approx 7.92 \\text{ h}$$\nThe typical range for clozapine's elimination half-life is wide, often cited as $6-26$ hours, with a mean around $12-16$ hours. A half-life of approximately $7.9$ hours is on the short side of this range, which is consistent with a \"rapid metabolism\" phenotype. This could be due to genetic factors or induction of metabolizing enzymes (e.g., cytochrome P450 $1\\text{A}2$ by smoking).\n\n**2. Evaluate Competing Hypotheses**\n\nWe will now test the two main scenarios: (A) Adherence with rapid metabolism, and (B) A missed dose with a \"typical\" metabolism. The $k_e$ and $t_{1/2}$ calculated above are derived directly from the data and must hold true in either scenario for the points to be valid. The key is to check for consistency with other known physiological constraints, such as plausible peak drug concentrations.\n\n**Hypothesis A: Dose Adherence with Rapid Metabolism**\nUnder this hypothesis, the patient took the $300 \\text{ mg}$ dose at $t=0$ ($20{:}00$). The calculated $t_{1/2} \\approx 7.9 \\text{ h}$ reflects the patient's actual pharmacokinetic profile. To check for plausibility, we can back-extrapolate to estimate the concentration at the start of the elimination phase. The problem states this is at $t=8 \\text{ h}$ ($04{:}00$).\n$$C(8 \\text{ h}) = C(12 \\text{ h}) \\cdot e^{-k_e (8 \\text{ h} - 12 \\text{ h})}$$\n$$C(8 \\text{ h}) = (400 \\text{ ng/mL}) \\cdot e^{-0.08748 \\cdot (-4)}$$\n$$C(8 \\text{ h}) = (400 \\text{ ng/mL}) \\cdot e^{0.34992} \\approx (400 \\text{ ng/mL}) \\cdot 1.419$$\n$$C(8 \\text{ h}) \\approx 568 \\text{ ng/mL}$$\nThis concentration of $568 \\text{ ng/mL}$ at the start of the elimination phase is plausible for a $300 \\text{ mg}$ dose of clozapine. While therapeutic ranges often target troughs of $100-350 \\text{ ng/mL}$ and peaks are variable, concentrations significantly above $1000 \\text{ ng/mL}$ are generally associated with increased toxicity risk. A peak around $570 \\text{ ng/mL}$ is well within the bounds of plausibility. Therefore, this hypothesis is consistent with the data.\n\n**Hypothesis B: Missed Dose**\nUnder this hypothesis, the patient did *not* take the scheduled dose at $t=0$ ($20{:}00$). The last dose was taken $24$ hours prior, at $t=-24 \\text{ h}$. The measured concentrations are thus points on the tail end of the decay curve from that earlier dose. The times corresponding to the samples are not $t_1=12 \\text{ h}$ and $t_2=24 \\text{ h}$ post-dose, but rather $t'_1 = 12 \\text{ h} + 24 \\text{ h} = 36 \\text{ h}$ and $t'_2 = 24 \\text{ h} + 24 \\text{ h} = 48 \\text{ h}$ after the true last dose.\nThe elimination rate constant, $k_e$, depends only on the ratio of concentrations and the time interval between them ($\\Delta t = 12 \\text{ h}$), so its value remains $k_e \\approx 0.08748 \\text{ h}^{-1}$. Let's test the plausibility of this scenario by back-extrapolating to the peak concentration from the dose at $t=-24 \\text{ h}$. The elimination phase for that dose would have started around $t = -24 \\text{ h} + 8 \\text{ h} = -16 \\text{ h}$.\nWe back-extrapolate from Sample $1$ (now at time $t'_1=36$ h relative to the true dose) to the start of the elimination phase (at time $t_{start} \\approx 8$ h relative to the true dose). The time difference is $36 \\text{ h} - 8 \\text{ h} = 28 \\text{ h}$.\n$$C_{start} = C_1 \\cdot e^{-k_e (8 \\text{ h} - 36 \\text{ h})}$$\n$$C_{start} = (400 \\text{ ng/mL}) \\cdot e^{-0.08748 \\cdot (-28)}$$\n$$C_{start} = (400 \\text{ ng/mL}) \\cdot e^{2.44944} \\approx (400 \\text{ ng/mL}) \\cdot 11.58$$\n$$C_{start} \\approx 4632 \\text{ ng/mL}$$\nA post-absorption concentration of over $4600 \\text{ ng/mL}$ is physiologically implausible and would be associated with extreme toxicity or lethality. Therefore, the missed dose hypothesis is not consistent with the data.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. The data are most consistent with rapid metabolism (for example, CYP1A2 induction) with dose adherence; a missed dose is unlikely because back-extrapolation would imply a physiologically implausible peak concentration.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the derivation above.\n- The calculated half-life of $\\approx 7.9 \\text{ h}$ is consistent with rapid metabolism.\n- Dose adherence leads to a plausible back-extrapolated concentration of $\\approx 568 \\text{ ng/mL}$.\n- The missed dose scenario is shown to be unlikely because it requires a preceding peak concentration of $\\approx 4632 \\text{ ng/mL}$, which is physiologically implausible.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.
