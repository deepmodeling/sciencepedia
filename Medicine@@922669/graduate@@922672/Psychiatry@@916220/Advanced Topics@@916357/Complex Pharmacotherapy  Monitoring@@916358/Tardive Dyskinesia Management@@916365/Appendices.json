Deutetrabenazine is a real medication, and the dose adjustment guidelines provided are consistent with its official prescribing information when coadministered with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors. The premises are factually correct.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear initial condition and a set of unambiguous rules and constraints to calculate a single, specific value (the adjusted total daily dose). The information is sufficient and not contradictory.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language, free from subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be computed.\n\nThe patient's initial total daily dose of deutetrabenazine is given as $D_{initial} = 24$ mg/day. A new medication, which is a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor, is introduced. We must apply the given pharmacokinetic constraints to determine the new, safe total daily dose, which we will denote as $D_{adjusted}$.\n\nThe primary rule for dose adjustment is that the total daily dose should be reduced by a factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$. Applying this rule to the initial dose:\n$$D_{adjusted} = D_{initial} \\times \\frac{1}{2}$$\nSubstituting the given value for $D_{initial}$:\n$$D_{adjusted} = 24 \\, \\text{mg/day} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 12 \\, \\text{mg/day}$$\n\nNow, we must verify that this calculated dose of $12$ mg/day adheres to the specified maximum safety limits.\n\nThe first safety limit states that the total daily dose must not exceed $36$ mg/day. We check if our calculated dose satisfies this condition:\n$$D_{adjusted} \\leq 36 \\, \\text{mg/day}$$\n$$12 \\, \\text{mg/day} \\leq 36 \\, \\text{mg/day}$$\nThis condition is satisfied.\n\nThe second safety limit states that any single dose must not exceed $18$ mg. The problem asks for the total daily dose, not the administration schedule. A total daily dose of $12$ mg can be administered in a way that respects this limit. For instance, it could be given as a single $12$ mg dose or as two $6$ mg doses. In either case, the single dose ($12$ mg or $6$ mg) is less than the maximum single dose of $18$ mg. Thus, a total daily dose of $12$ mg/day is consistent with this constraint.\n\nSince the calculated adjusted dose of $12$ mg/day is derived from the primary adjustment rule and satisfies all stated safety constraints, it is the correct final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{12}\n$$", "id": "4765195"}, {"introduction": "Advanced clinical practice requires not only treating a known diagnosis but also accurately differentiating it from its mimics.

Its validity is assessed as follows:\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly grounded in established principles of clinical psychiatry and psychopharmacology.\n    - The descriptions of Patient $1$ and Patient $2$ are classic, textbook presentations of antipsychotic-induced akathisia and tardive dyskinesia (TD), respectively.\n    - Akathisia (Patient $1$) is characterized by subjective inner restlessness and objective motor restlessness, with acute onset after initiation or dose increase of an antipsychotic (especially aripiprazole). The high BARS score ($3$) and low AIMS score ($1$) are consistent with this.\n    - Tardive dyskinesia (Patient $2$) is characterized by involuntary, stereotyped movements (often orofacial), developing after long-term exposure to dopamine receptor blocking agents (like haloperidol). The patient's lack of awareness, worsening with distraction, high AIMS score ($7$), and low BARS score ($0$) are classic features.\n    - The medications mentioned (aripiprazole, haloperidol, propranolol, benzodiazepines, VMAT2 inhibitors, clozapine, benztropine, amantadine) and their roles, side effects, and indications are all standard knowledge in the field.\n    - The use of standardized scales (AIMS, BARS) is correct and represents best practice.\n\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The detailed clinical information for each patient is sufficient to arrive at a specific diagnosis and formulate a first-line management plan based on current evidence-based guidelines. The question asks for the \"best\" option, which is standard in this format and requires identifying the plan that most closely aligns with the standard of care.\n\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using objective clinical terminology. Patient-reported symptoms are appropriately framed as subjective data.\n\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. It provides the necessary information (symptoms, signs, timeline, medication history, scale scores, and relevant negative history) to solve the problem without requiring external or assumed data. There are no contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-constructed, scientifically sound, and objective clinical reasoning problem. Proceeding to solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation**\n\n**Patient 1 Diagnosis and Management:**\nThe patient's presentation—acute onset ($7$ days) of severe subjective inner restlessness and objective motor agitation following an increase in aripiprazole dose—is the defining clinical picture of **akathisia**. The high BARS score ($3$) confirms this. The distress and passive suicidal ideation highlight the urgency of treatment. The first-line management strategy for akathisia involves a multi-pronged approach:\n1.  **Reduce or Discontinue the Offending Agent**: The most definitive treatment is to lower the dose of the causative drug, in this case, aripiprazole. This must be balanced against the risk of worsening psychosis.\n2.  **Pharmacological Intervention**: The primary, evidence-based treatments are beta-blockers, specifically propranolol (as long as there are no contraindications, which is the case here). Doses typically start around $20$ mg two to three times daily and are titrated.\n3.  **Adjunctive/Alternative Agents**: Benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam) can be effective, particularly for acute, severe akathisia, but are generally used short-term due to risks of tolerance, dependence, and sedation. Mirtazapine is another evidence-based option.\n4.  **Avoidance of Ineffective/Harmful Agents**: Anticholinergic agents (e.g., benztropine) are generally not effective for akathisia and may worsen cognitive function or cause other side effects.\n\n**Patient 2 Diagnosis and Management:**\nThe patient's presentation—involuntary orofacial and choreoathetoid finger movements developing after chronic ($3$ years) exposure to a first-generation antipsychotic (haloperidol), with a lack of awareness and a high AIMS score ($7$)—is the defining clinical picture of **tardive dyskinesia (TD)**. The BARS score of $0$ confirms the absence of akathisia. The first-line management strategy for TD is:\n1.  **Pharmacological Intervention**: The FDA-approved, first-line treatments are VMAT2 inhibitors (valbenazine, deutetrabenazine). These agents work by reducing dopamine release in the nigrostriatal pathway. Valbenazine is typically initiated at $40$ mg daily and titrated to $80$ mg daily.\n2.  **Antipsychotic Management**: The antipsychotic regimen should be reviewed. Abruptly stopping a long-acting injectable like haloperidol is highly risky and likely to cause a severe psychotic relapse. A better long-term strategy is to consider switching to an antipsychotic with a lower risk of causing or worsening TD, such as clozapine or possibly quetiapine. This transition must be planned carefully to maintain psychiatric stability.\n3.  **Avoidance of Harmful Agents**: Anticholinergic agents (e.g., benztropine) can worsen the movements of TD and should be avoided or discontinued if being used for other purposes.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Diagnose Patient $1$ with akathisia and Patient $2$ with tardive dyskinesia; for Patient $1$, reduce aripiprazole dose and initiate propranolol (for example, $20$–$40$ mg three times daily, titrate as tolerated), with optional short-term benzodiazepine; for Patient $2$, start a VMAT2 inhibitor such as valbenazine (titrating to $80$ mg daily as tolerated) and plan transition to clozapine to minimize TD risk; avoid anticholinergics for both.**\n\n-   **Diagnosis:** Correct for both patients.\n-   **Patient 1 Management:** This plan is textbook-perfect. It includes reducing the offending agent, initiating the first-line pharmacotherapy (propranolol), and considering short-term adjunctive treatment for severe distress (benzodiazepine).\n-   **Patient 2 Management:** This plan is also excellent. It initiates the first-line treatment for TD (a VMAT2 inhibitor) and incorporates a sound long-term strategy to mitigate future risk (planning a switch to clozapine) while ensuring psychiatric stability.\n-   **General Advice:** The instruction to avoid anticholinergics is correct and important for both conditions.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Diagnose both patients with extrapyramidal symptoms responsive to anticholinergics; administer benztropine to both and increase haloperidol for Patient $2$ to suppress movements; defer VMAT2 inhibitors and beta-blockers until anticholinergic response is assessed.**\n\n-   **Diagnosis:** Incorrect. This fails to differentiate between akathisia and TD, which have different pathophysiologies and treatments. Akathisia is a distinct syndrome, not just a generic \"EPS,\" and is not responsive to anticholinergics. TD is also distinct and can be worsened by anticholinergics.\n-   **Management:** Incorrect and dangerous. Administering benztropine is inappropriate for akathisia and can be harmful in TD. Increasing the haloperidol dose to suppress TD movements is a historically used but now strongly discouraged practice that masks the problem while worsening the underlying pathology. Deferring first-line agents (beta-blockers, VMAT2 inhibitors) is incorrect.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Diagnose both patients with tardive dyskinesia based on antipsychotic exposure; initiate VMAT2 inhibitor therapy for both; maintain current antipsychotic regimens to avoid destabilizing psychiatric symptoms.**\n\n-   **Diagnosis:** Incorrect. Patient $1$ clearly has akathisia, not TD, based on the acute onset, subjective distress, and BARS score.\n-   **Management:** Incorrect. VMAT2 inhibitors are not indicated for akathisia. While maintaining the current antipsychotic is a reasonable consideration for Patient $2$ in the short term, it is an incorrect primary step for Patient $1$, where dose reduction is key.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Diagnose Patient $1$ with akathisia and Patient $2$ with tardive dyskinesia; for Patient $1$, provide benzodiazepine monotherapy while maintaining aripiprazole dose to preserve antipsychotic efficacy; for Patient $2$, abruptly discontinue the haloperidol LAI to remove dopamine blockade and reassess movements in $2$–$4$ weeks.**\n\n-   **Diagnosis:** Correct for both patients.\n-   **Patient 1 Management:** Suboptimal. Propranolol is the preferred first-line agent over benzodiazepines. Failing to attempt a dose reduction of aripiprazole ignores the most direct solution.\n-   **Patient 2 Management:** Dangerous. Abruptly discontinuing an LAI in a patient with a stable severe mental illness creates an extremely high risk of psychotic relapse, a medical emergency. This is a critical error in risk management.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Diagnose Patient $1$ with akathisia and Patient $2$ with tardive dyskinesia; for Patient $1$, add propranolol while increasing aripiprazole to improve psychosis control; for Patient $2$, begin amantadine as first-line, reserving VMAT2 inhibitors for refractory cases; consider adding benztropine if dystonia is suspected.**\n\n-   **Diagnosis:** Correct for both patients.\n-   **Patient 1 Management:** Illogical and harmful. Increasing the dose of the medication causing the akathisia will almost certainly worsen the akathisia, which the patient already finds \"unbearable\" and is causing suicidal thoughts.\n-   **Patient 2 Management:** Incorrect. Amantadine is not a first-line treatment for TD; its evidence is weak. VMAT2 inhibitors are the established first-line therapy. Adding benztropine is also ill-advised as it can worsen TD, and there is no mention of dystonia in the patient's presentation.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4765050"}]}
