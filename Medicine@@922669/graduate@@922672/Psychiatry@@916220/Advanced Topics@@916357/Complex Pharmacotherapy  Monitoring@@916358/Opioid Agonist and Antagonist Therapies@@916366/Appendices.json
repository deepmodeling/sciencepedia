Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to derive an expression for fractional occupancy, $Occ$, in terms of the given quantities $C$ and $K_d$. We begin with the fundamental definitions provided.\n\nThe fractional occupancy is defined as:\n$$Occ = \\frac{[RL]}{R_{T}}$$\n\nThe total receptor concentration is the sum of free and bound receptors:\n$$R_{T} = [R] + [RL]$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to express the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$, in terms of the total and bound receptor concentrations:\n$$[R] = R_{T} - [RL]$$\n\nThe dissociation constant, $K_{d}$, is given by:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[L][R]}{[RL]}$$\n\nWe now substitute the expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $K_{d}$:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[L](R_{T} - [RL])}{[RL]}$$\n\nThe goal is to solve for the ratio $\\frac{[RL]}{R_{T}}$. To do this, we rearrange the equation. First, multiply both sides by $[RL]$:\n$$K_{d}[RL] = [L](R_{T} - [RL])$$\n\nDistribute $[L]$ on the right-hand side:\n$$K_{d}[RL] = [L]R_{T} - [L][RL]$$\n\nGroup all terms containing $[RL]$ on the left-hand side of the equation:\n$$K_{d}[RL] + [L][RL] = [L]R_{T}$$\n\nFactor out the common term $[RL]$:\n$$[RL](K_{d} + [L]) = [L]R_{T}$$\n\nTo obtain the expression for fractional occupancy, $Occ = \\frac{[RL]}{R_{T}}$, we divide both sides by $R_{T}$ and by $(K_{d} + [L])$:\n$$\\frac{[RL]}{R_{T}} = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d} + [L]}$$\n\nThus, the symbolic expression for fractional occupancy is:\n$$Occ = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d} + [L]}$$\n\nThis is the Hill-Langmuir equation for a system with a Hill coefficient of $1$. The problem states that the free ligand concentration $[L]$ can be approximated by the plasma concentration $C$. Substituting $C$ for $[L]$ gives the final symbolic form:\n$$Occ = \\frac{C}{K_{d} + C}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values: $C = 1.0$ ng/mL and $K_{d} = 0.5$ ng/mL.\n$$Occ = \\frac{1.0 \\, \\text{ng/mL}}{0.5 \\, \\text{ng/mL} + 1.0 \\, \\text{ng/mL}}$$\n$$Occ = \\frac{1.0}{1.5}$$\n\nTo express this as a simple fraction, we can write $1.5$ as $\\frac{3}{2}$:\n$$Occ = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{2}}$$\n$$Occ = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nThe fractional occupancy is $\\frac{2}{3}$. This is a dimensionless quantity as the units of concentration in the numerator and denominator cancel.\n\n### Qualitative Reasoning\nThe calculated occupancy is $\\frac{2}{3}$, or approximately $66.7\\%$. This high level of occupancy by a high-affinity partial agonist has significant clinical implications. With two-thirds of $\\mu$-opioid receptors (MORs) occupied, there is a substantially reduced pool of available receptors for other ligands to bind. This means that an exogenous full agonist, such as heroin or fentanyl, would face significant competition. The clinical effect is a blunting or \"blockade\" of the euphoric effects of illicit opioids, which is a primary therapeutic goal.\n\nIn the context of an antagonist challenge (e.g., administration of naloxone), the antagonist must compete with the partial agonist already bound to the MORs. Because the partial agonist has high affinity (indicated by the low $K_d$ relative to the therapeutic concentration), it binds tightly and is not easily displaced. If an antagonist with even higher affinity is administered, it can displace the partial agonist, leading to a rapid drop in receptor activation from the partial agonism level to zero. This precipitates a severe withdrawal syndrome, a clinical risk that must be carefully managed.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}\n$$", "id": "4735456"}, {"introduction": "Effective opioid agonist therapy with drugs like methadone depends on achieving and maintaining a therapeutic plasma concentration.

A solution will be derived from the specified first principles.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\nThe problem requires a derivation from two fundamental principles at steady state.\n\nThe first principle states that at steady state, the average rate of drug entering the systemic circulation is equal to the average rate of drug elimination from the body. This can be expressed as:\n$$(\\text{Rate In})_{avg} = (\\text{Rate Out})_{avg}$$\n\nLet us analyze each term.\n\nThe drug is administered as an oral dose, designated as $Dose$. Due to incomplete absorption and first-pass metabolism, only a fraction $F$, the bioavailability, reaches the systemic circulation. Thus, the amount of drug that enters the systemic circulation per dosing interval is $F \\cdot Dose$. The dosing interval is $\\tau$. The average rate of drug entry into the systemic circulation, $(\\text{Rate In})_{avg}$, is this amount averaged over the dosing interval:\n$$(\\text{Rate In})_{avg} = \\frac{F \\cdot Dose}{\\tau}$$\n\nThe second principle defines systemic clearance, $CL$, as the constant of proportionality that relates the instantaneous rate of drug elimination to the plasma drug concentration, $C(t)$:\n$$\\text{Rate of Elimination}(t) = CL \\cdot C(t)$$\nThis relationship holds because the problem specifies linear pharmacokinetics, meaning clearance is constant and does not depend on concentration.\n\nTo find the average rate of elimination over one dosing interval at steady state, $(\\text{Rate Out})_{avg}$, we integrate the instantaneous rate over the interval from a time $t$ to $t+\\tau$ (where $t$ is any time after steady state has been achieved) and divide by the interval duration $\\tau$:\n$$(\\text{Rate Out})_{avg} = \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\int_{t}^{t+\\tau} \\text{Rate of Elimination}(t') \\, dt' = \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\int_{t}^{t+\\tau} CL \\cdot C(t') \\, dt'$$\nSince $CL$ is a constant, it can be moved outside the integral:\n$$(\\text{Rate Out})_{avg} = CL \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\int_{t}^{t+\\tau} C(t') \\, dt' \\right)$$\nThe term in the parentheses is the definition of the average plasma concentration over a dosing interval at steady state, denoted as $C_{ss,avg}$:\n$$C_{ss,avg} \\equiv \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\int_{t}^{t+\\tau} C(t') \\, dt'$$\nTherefore, the average rate of elimination can be expressed in terms of the average steady-state concentration:\n$$(\\text{Rate Out})_{avg} = CL \\cdot C_{ss,avg}$$\n\nNow, we equate the average rate of entry and the average rate of elimination as per the steady-state condition:\n$$\\frac{F \\cdot Dose}{\\tau} = CL \\cdot C_{ss,avg}$$\nSolving for $C_{ss,avg}$ yields the desired analytic expression:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\cdot Dose}{CL \\cdot \\tau}$$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for the patient. The given values are:\n$F = 0.8$\n$Dose = 50\\ \\mathrm{mg}$\n$CL = 10\\ \\mathrm{L/h}$\n$\\tau = 24\\ \\mathrm{h}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{0.8 \\cdot 50\\ \\mathrm{mg}}{(10\\ \\mathrm{L/h}) \\cdot (24\\ \\mathrm{h})}$$\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{40\\ \\mathrm{mg}}{240\\ \\mathrm{L}}$$\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{1}{6}\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.16666...\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$.

The clinical implication is that the full pharmacodynamic effect, including potential toxicity, of a chosen daily dose will not be apparent for several days. Therefore, initiating therapy and adjusting doses must be done cautiously, with dose increases spaced sufficiently far apart (e.g., several days) to allow plasma concentrations to approach a new steady state.
