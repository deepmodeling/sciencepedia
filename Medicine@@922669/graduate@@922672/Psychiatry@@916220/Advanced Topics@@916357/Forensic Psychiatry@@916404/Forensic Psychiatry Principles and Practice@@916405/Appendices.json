The concepts of base rate, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value are standard in medical diagnostics and risk assessment.

The question is unambiguous and asks for the most accurate correction of a common statistical fallacy.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is objective. The data are presented as quantitative measures, and the question requires a logical-mathematical calculation and its correct interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is a valid problem. The solution will proceed by calculating the correct posterior probability and evaluating each option.\n\n**Derivation of the Correct Answer**\nThe central task is to calculate the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is the probability of an individual reoffending given a positive test result, denoted as $P(R|+)$. We will use Bayes' theorem.\n\nThe givens are:\n-   Prior probability of reoffending, $P(R) = 0.02$.\n-   Probability of not reoffending, $P(NR) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98$.\n-   Sensitivity, $P(+|R) = 0.80$.\n-   Specificity, $P(-|NR) = 0.90$.\n\nFrom the specificity, we can derive the False Positive Rate (FPR), which is the probability of a positive test result in a non-reoffender:\n$$ FPR = P(+|NR) = 1 - P(-|NR) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 $$\n\nBayes' theorem for this problem is:\n$$ P(R|+) = \\frac{P(+|R) P(R)}{P(+)} $$\n\nFirst, we must calculate the total probability of a positive test result, $P(+)$, using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(+) = P(+|R)P(R) + P(+|NR)P(NR) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ P(+) = (0.80)(0.02) + (0.10)(0.98) $$\n$$ P(+) = 0.016 + 0.098 = 0.114 $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the PPV, $P(R|+)$:\n$$ P(R|+) = \\frac{P(+|R) P(R)}{P(+)} = \\frac{0.016}{0.114} $$\n$$ P(R|+) \\approx 0.14035 $$\nThus, the probability of the man reoffending within $5$ years, given the 'high risk' classification, is approximately $14\\%$.\n\nAn alternative, and often more intuitive, method is using natural frequencies, as is suggested in one of the options. Consider a hypothetical cohort of $1000$ individuals:\n-   Number of individuals who will reoffend: $1000 \\times P(R) = 1000 \\times 0.02 = 20$.\n-   Number of individuals who will not reoffend: $1000 - 20 = 980$.\n\nNext, we apply the test to these two groups:\n-   **True Positives**: Reoffenders who test positive: $20 \\times P(+|R) = 20 \\times 0.80 = 16$.\n-   **False Positives**: Non-reoffenders who test positive: $980 \\times P(+|NR) = 980 \\times 0.10 = 98$.\n\nThe total number of individuals who receive a 'high risk' (positive) test result is the sum of true positives and false positives:\n$$ \\text{Total Positives} = 16 + 98 = 114 $$\n\nThe proportion of those who test positive and will actually reoffend is the ratio of true positives to total positives:\n$$ P(R|+) = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{Total Positives}} = \\frac{16}{114} \\approx 0.14035 \\approx 14\\% $$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The man's risk is approximately $14\\%$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. “Because sensitivity is $0.80$, there is an $80\\%$ chance he will sexually reoffend within $5$ years; sensitivity is the probability of the outcome given a positive result.”**\nThis statement is incorrect. It commits the base rate fallacy by equating sensitivity, $P(+|R)$, with the positive predictive value, $P(R|+)$. The definition provided is also wrong; sensitivity is the probability of a positive result given the condition (outcome), not the other way around. My calculation shows the risk is $~14\\%$, not $80\\%$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. “In a population with a $2\\%$ base rate and a tool with sensitivity $0.80$ and specificity $0.90$, a positive (‘high risk’) result corresponds to roughly a $14\\%$ chance of $5$-year sexual recidivism. In natural frequencies: out of $1000$ similar individuals, about $20$ would reoffend; about $16$ of those would be flagged ‘high risk,’ and about $98$ non-reoffenders would also be flagged, so approximately $16$ of $114$ flagged ‘high risk’ would reoffend.”**\nThis statement's final conclusion of a $14\\%$ chance is consistent with my calculation ($0.14035$). The explanation using natural frequencies for a cohort of $1000$ is also arithmetically correct, as demonstrated in my derivation: $20$ reoffenders, $16$ of whom are true positives; $980$ non-reoffenders, $98$ of whom are false positives. The final risk is correctly calculated as $16$ out of a total of $114$ positive tests. This statement accurately corrects the base rate fallacy and communicates the risk clearly and correctly.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. “Because specificity is $0.90$, only $10\\%$ of those flagged ‘high risk’ are false positives, so the risk for this individual is about $90\\%$.”**\nThis statement is incorrect. It confuses the false positive rate ($FPR = P(+|NR) = 0.10$, or $10\\%$) with the false discovery rate ($FDR = P(NR|+) = 1 - P(R|+)$). The FPR is the proportion of *non-reoffenders* who test positive. The FDR is the proportion of *positive tests* that are from non-reoffenders. My calculation shows that out of $114$ positive tests, $98$ are false positives. The false discovery rate is thus $98/114 \\approx 86\\%$, not $10\\%$. The conclusion of a $90\\%$ risk is based on this faulty logic and is grossly incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. “The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of $0.80$ means that $80\\%$ of those scoring ‘high risk’ will reoffend, so one can fairly state an $80\\%$ probability for this individual.”**\nThis statement is incorrect. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is a global measure of a classifier's ability to distinguish between two groups across all possible thresholds. An AUC of $0.80$ has a specific probabilistic interpretation: there is an $80\\%$ chance that a randomly chosen positive case will be ranked higher by the test than a randomly chosen negative case. It is not equivalent to sensitivity, nor is it the positive predictive value. The problem states the sensitivity is $0.80$, not the AUC. Even if the AUC were $0.80$, it would not mean the risk is $80\\%$. This statement misinterprets a statistical concept to justify the base rate fallacy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. “Use the positive likelihood ratio by multiplying the base rate by $8$ (from $0.80/(1-0.90)$) to get a $16\\%$ risk; reporting $16\\%$ is the correct way to adjust for base rates in this context.”**\nThis statement describes an incorrect application of likelihood ratios. The Positive Likelihood Ratio ($LR+$) is correctly calculated as $\\frac{\\text{Sensitivity}}{1 - \\text{Specificity}} = \\frac{0.80}{0.10} = 8$. However, one must update the *odds* of the event, not the probability (the base rate).\nThe correct procedure is:\n1.  Calculate prior odds: $\\text{Odds}(R) = \\frac{P(R)}{1-P(R)} = \\frac{0.02}{0.98}$.\n2.  Calculate posterior odds: $\\text{Odds}(R|+) = \\text{Odds}(R) \\times LR+ = \\frac{0.02}{0.98} \\times 8 = \\frac{0.16}{0.98}$.\n3.  Convert posterior odds to probability: $P(R|+) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(R|+)}{1 + \\text{Odds}(R|+)} = \\frac{0.16/0.98}{1 + 0.16/0.98} = \\frac{0.16}{0.98 + 0.16} = \\frac{0.16}{1.14} \\approx 0.14035$, or $14\\%$.\nThe method proposed in the option (multiplying the base rate by $LR+$) yields $0.02 \\times 8 = 0.16$, or $16\\%$. This is an approximation that is not methodologically sound and leads to an incorrect value. The correct risk is $14\\%$, not $16\\%$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4713171"}, {"introduction": "Real-world forensic opinions are rarely based on a single piece of data, and the consequences of being wrong are not always symmetrical.

If a liberal cutoff is used, a positive result yields a likelihood ratio positive (LR+) of $3.0$. If a conservative cutoff is used, a positive result yields an LR+ of $9.0$. Independently, the collateral record review indicates inconsistencies that, when present, have an LR+ of $1.5$ for malingering. Assume conditional independence between the SVT result and the collateral inconsistencies for the purposes of combining evidence. In this case, the SVT is positive, and collateral inconsistencies are present.\n\nThe evaluator must decide whether to formally opine malingering (i.e., to accuse), recognizing explicit asymmetric consequences.
