In practice, DBS stimulators use biphasic pulses designed to be charge-balanced to avoid net Direct Current (DC) passing through the electrode-tissue interface. Start from the following fundamental bases: the definition of electric charge as the time integral of current, $Q=\\int i(t)\\,dt$, Faraday’s laws of electrolysis relating net charge transfer to the extent of electrode reactions, and the definition of the time-average of a periodic function, $\\overline{i}=\\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T}i(t)\\,dt$ for period $T$.\n\nYou are asked to address both the biophysical rationale and the quantitative consequences of asymmetry:\n\n1. Explain, using the above bases and the concept of the electrochemical “water window” for noble metals, why DBS pulses must be charge-balanced (i.e., have net $\\int i(t)\\,dt$ per cycle equal to zero) to minimize irreversible Faradaic reactions that cause local pH shifts, gas evolution, tissue injury, and electrode corrosion.\n\n2. Consider an asymmetric biphasic waveform with a cathodic first phase of constant current $I_{c}  0$ for duration $t_{c} > 0$, an anodic second phase of constant current $I_{a} > 0$ for duration $t_{a} > 0$, and an interphase gap of duration $t_{g} > 0$ with zero current.

Assume zero current during the interphase gap and between pulses.", "solution": "The problem will be addressed in three parts as requested: first, a biophysical explanation for charge-balanced pulses; second, the derivation of an expression for the DC offset; and third, the calculation of this offset for the given parameters.\n\n### Part 1: Rationale for Charge-Balanced Pulses\n\nThe requirement for charge-balanced pulses in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a direct consequence of fundamental electrochemical principles, specifically Faraday's laws of electrolysis, applied to the electrode-tissue interface.\n\n1.  **Charge and Faradaic Reactions:** Faraday's laws state that the amount of a substance produced or consumed in an electrochemical reaction is directly proportional to the total electric charge passed through the electrode. The net charge, $Q_{\\mathrm{net}}$, delivered over one stimulation period, $T$, is given by the time integral of the current, $i(t)$, over that period:\n    $$ Q_{\\mathrm{net}} = \\int_{0}^{T} i(t) \\, dt $$\n    If $Q_{\\mathrm{net}}$ is non-zero, it signifies a net flow of electrons in one direction, which must be balanced by a net chemical transformation (a Faradaic reaction) at the electrode-tissue interface. A non-zero time-averaged current, $\\overline{I}_{\\mathrm{DC}} = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T}i(t)\\,dt = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{net}}}{T}$, is thus a direct measure of the rate of net Faradaic reactions.\n\n2.  **The Electrochemical Water Window:** The brain's interstitial fluid is an aqueous electrolyte solution. For a given electrode material, such as the platinum-iridium alloy used in DBS, there exists a range of electrode potentials within which water is thermodynamically stable and does not undergo oxidation or reduction. This range is known as the electrochemical \"water window\". Within this window, charge can be transferred safely through primarily non-Faradaic mechanisms (charging and discharging the capacitive double layer at the interface) and reversible Faradaic reactions (e.g., formation of a monolayer of platinum oxide). These processes do not cause cumulative damage.\n\n3.  **Consequences of Charge Imbalance:** If a pulse is not charge-balanced, $Q_{\\mathrm{net}} \\neq 0$. This continuous injection of net charge drives the electrode's potential towards and eventually beyond the limits of the water window.\n    *   **Excessive Cathodic Charge ($Q_{\\mathrm{net}}  0$):** The electrode potential becomes highly negative, leading to the reduction of water:\n        $$ 2H_2O + 2e^- \\rightarrow H_2(g) + 2OH^- $$\n        This reaction produces hydrogen gas ($H_2$), which can cause mechanical damage to tissue, and hydroxide ions ($OH^-$), which cause a local increase in pH (alkalosis), leading to neurotoxicity.\n    *   **Excessive Anodic Charge ($Q_{\\mathrm{net}} > 0$):** The electrode potential becomes highly positive, leading to the oxidation of water or other species like chloride ions ($Cl^-$):\n        $$ 2H_2O \\rightarrow O_2(g) + 4H^+ + 4e^- $$\n        $$ 2Cl^- \\rightarrow Cl_2(g) + 2e^- $$\n        These reactions generate oxygen ($O_2$) or highly toxic chlorine gas ($Cl_2$), and protons ($H^+$), which cause a local decrease in pH (acidosis). Furthermore, these oxidative processes can corrode the noble metal electrode itself, degrading the device and releasing potentially toxic metal ions into the tissue.\n\nIn summary, to ensure the long-term safety and stability of DBS, the net charge injected per cycle must be zero ($Q_{\\mathrm{net}} = 0$). This practice, known as charge-balancing, confines the electrode potential within the safe water window, thereby preventing irreversible and damaging Faradaic reactions, tissue injury, and electrode corrosion.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Net DC Offset\n\nThe net DC offset, $\\overline{I}_{\\mathrm{DC}}$, is defined as the time-averaged current over one full period, $T$. The period is related to the stimulation frequency $f$ by $T = \\frac{1}{f}$.\n$$ \\overline{I}_{\\mathrm{DC}} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} i(t) \\, dt $$\nThe current waveform $i(t)$ over one period from $t=0$ to $t=T$ is defined piecewise based on the problem description:\n- A cathodic phase: $i(t) = I_c$ for $0 \\le t  t_c$.\n- An interphase gap: $i(t) = 0$ for $t_c \\le t  t_c + t_g$.\n- An anodic phase: $i(t) = I_a$ for $t_c + t_g \\le t  t_c + t_g + t_a$.\n- The remainder of the period: $i(t) = 0$ for $t_c + t_g + t_a \\le t  T$.\n\nThe integral for $\\overline{I}_{\\mathrm{DC}}$ can be broken down according to these intervals:\n$$ \\overline{I}_{\\mathrm{DC}} = \\frac{1}{T} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{t_c} i(t) \\, dt + \\int_{t_c}^{t_c+t_g} i(t) \\, dt + \\int_{t_c+t_g}^{t_c+t_g+t_a} i(t) \\, dt + \\int_{t_c+t_g+t_a}^{T} i(t) \\, dt \\right] $$\nSubstituting the constant current values for each interval:\n$$ \\overline{I}_{\\mathrm{DC}} = \\frac{1}{T} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{t_c} I_c \\, dt + \\int_{t_c}^{t_c+t_g} 0 \\, dt + \\int_{t_c+t_g}^{t_c+t_g+t_a} I_a \\, dt + \\int_{t_c+t_g+t_a}^{T} 0 \\, dt \\right] $$\nEvaluating the integrals:\nThe first integral is $\\int_{0}^{t_c} I_c \\, dt = I_c [t]_{0}^{t_c} = I_c (t_c - 0) = I_c t_c$.\nThe third integral is $\\int_{t_c+t_g}^{t_c+t_g+t_a} I_a \\, dt = I_a [t]_{t_c+t_g}^{t_c+t_g+t_a} = I_a((t_c+t_g+t_a) - (t_c+t_g)) = I_a t_a$.\nThe other integrals are zero.\n\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $\\overline{I}_{\\mathrm{DC}}$:\n$$ \\overline{I}_{\\mathrm{DC}} = \\frac{1}{T} \\left[ I_c t_c + 0 + I_a t_a + 0 \\right] = \\frac{I_c t_c + I_a t_a}{T} $$\nThe term $I_c t_c + I_a t_a$ represents the net charge delivered per pulse, $Q_{\\mathrm{pulse}}$.\nSince $T = \\frac{1}{f}$, we can express the DC offset in terms of the frequency $f$:\n$$ \\overline{I}_{\\mathrm{DC}} = (I_c t_c + I_a t_a) f $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Calculation\n\nWe use the derived expression $\\overline{I}_{\\mathrm{DC}} = (I_c t_c + I_a t_a) f$ and substitute the given numerical values.
