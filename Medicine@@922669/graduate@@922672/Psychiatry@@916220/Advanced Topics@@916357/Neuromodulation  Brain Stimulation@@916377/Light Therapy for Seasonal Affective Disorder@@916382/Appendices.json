A rectangular light box with luminous aperture dimensions of $0.20$ m by $0.30$ m is specified by the manufacturer to deliver an illuminance of $10{,}000$ lux at the corneal plane when the patient is positioned at a viewing distance of $30$ cm along the central axis. The clinician wishes to reposition the patient such that the corneal illuminance is $2{,}500$ lux while maintaining the same on-axis alignment and orientation. Assume that, in the far-field limit for a point-like emitter, illuminance diminishes in proportion to the inverse square of distance. Recognizing that the device is an extended source and that near-field behavior can deviate from the point-source model, compute the distance (on-axis) at which the point-source inverse-square approximation predicts an illuminance of $2{,}500$ lux, starting from the given reference point. Express your final answer in centimeters. Your reasoning should start from the fundamental geometric spreading principle for a point source and conclude with the computed distance, while noting qualitatively how the extended-source nature of the light box would be expected to bias this estimate in the near-field. The final numerical answer must be a single value in centimeters.", "solution": "The governing principle for this calculation is the inverse-square law for illuminance from a point source. This model is specified in the problem statement as the basis for the calculation. It posits that the illuminance, $E$, at a distance, $d$, from a point source is inversely proportional to the square of that distance. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$E \\propto \\frac{1}{d^2}$$\nThis relationship can be written as an equation involving a constant of proportionality, $k$, which is determined by the luminous intensity of the source along the measurement axis:\n$$E = \\frac{k}{d^2}$$\nWe are given an initial reference condition (state $1$) and a target condition (state $2$):\nState $1$: Illuminance $E_1 = 10{,}000$ lux at a distance $d_1 = 30$ cm.\nState $2$: Illuminance $E_2 = 2{,}500$ lux at an unknown distance $d_2$.\n\nUsing the model, we can write an equation for each state:\n$$E_1 = \\frac{k}{d_1^2}$$\n$$E_2 = \\frac{k}{d_2^2}$$\nTo find the unknown distance $d_2$, we can form a ratio of the two equations. This procedure eliminates the source-dependent constant $k$:\n$$\\frac{E_2}{E_1} = \\frac{k/d_2^2}{k/d_1^2} = \\frac{d_1^2}{d_2^2}$$\nSolving for $d_2$:\n$$d_2^2 = d_1^2 \\left( \\frac{E_1}{E_2} \\right)$$\n$$d_2 = d_1 \\sqrt{\\frac{E_1}{E_2}}$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values: $d_1 = 30$ cm, $E_1 = 10{,}000$ lux, and $E_2 = 2{,}500$ lux.\n$$d_2 = (30 \\, \\text{cm}) \\sqrt{\\frac{10{,}000}{2{,}500}}$$\n$$d_2 = (30 \\, \\text{cm}) \\sqrt{4}$$\n$$d_2 = (30 \\, \\text{cm}) \\times 2$$\n$$d_2 = 60 \\, \\text{cm}$$\nAccording to the point-source approximation, the required distance is $60$ cm.\n\nIt is crucial to consider the limitation of this model, as requested. The physical light box is an extended source with dimensions of $0.20 \\, \\text{m}$ by $0.30 \\, \\text{m}$. The inverse-square law is an accurate approximation only in the far-field region, where the distance from the source is much larger than the characteristic dimensions of the source itself. The initial measurement distance, $d_1 = 30 \\, \\text{cm} = 0.30 \\, \\text{m}$, is of the same order of magnitude as the source dimensions. This indicates that the measurement points lie within the near-field or intermediate-field regions.\n\nIn these regions, the illuminance from a planar extended source decreases with distance more slowly than the $d^{-2}$ relationship predicted by the point-source model. To achieve the same factor-of-four reduction in illuminance (from $10{,}000$ lux to $2{,}500$ lux), the patient must be moved to a distance greater than that predicted by the inverse-square law, which models a steeper-than-actual decline in illuminance. Therefore, the calculated value of $60$ cm represents an **underestimate** of the true physical distance required. The actual distance would be greater than $60$ cm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{60}$$", "id": "4723190"}, {"introduction": "While photopic illuminance measured in lux is the conventional standard, not all light is equal for the brain's circadian system, which is primarily driven by melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells.

The purpose is to quantify the melanopic stimulus in a manner comparable across spectra, using the International Commission on Illumination (CIE; International Commission on Illumination (CIE)) system for melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance (EDI).\n\nStarting from the following foundational definitions and principles:\n- Photopic illuminance $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$ is obtained by spectral weighting of the corneal spectral irradiance $E_{\\lambda}$ by the photopic luminous efficiency function $V(\\lambda)$ and a scaling constant $K_{\\mathrm{m}}$, acknowledging the linearity of spectral integrations over wavelength.\n- Melanopic stimulus for a given source is computed by weighting $E_{\\lambda}$ with the standardized melanopic sensitivity function $\\bar{m}(\\lambda)$ and an associated constant chosen such that the quantity is comparable across spectra when normalized to the CIE Standard Daylight (D65) reference.\n- Melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance $E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}}$ is defined as the photopic illuminance of a D65 daylight that would produce the same melanopic weighted stimulus as the test source.\n- The melanopic-to-photopic ratio $r$ for a test source is defined as the ratio of its melanopic weighted quantity to its photopic illuminance, both computed at the cornea under the same spectral power distribution.\n\nGiven a light box whose melanopic-to-photopic ratio is $r = 0.9$ and whose corneal photopic illuminance is $E_{\\mathrm{v}} = 10{,}000$ lux, derive from the above principles an expression for $E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}}$ in terms of $r$ and $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$, and then compute the numerical value for this device.\n\nExpress your final answer in lux, and round to four significant figures.

The spectral irradiance of a source is given by $E_{\\lambda}(\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength.\n\n**Principle 1: Photopic Illuminance**\nThe photopic illuminance, $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$, for any source is defined as the spectral irradiance weighted by the photopic luminous efficiency function $V(\\lambda)$ and scaled by a constant $K_{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 683 \\, \\mathrm{lm/W}$.\nFor the test source, the given photopic illuminance is $E_{\\mathrm{v}} = 10,000 \\, \\mathrm{lux}$.\n\n**Principle 2 & 3: Melanopic Stimulus and Melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance ($E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}}$)**\nThe melanopic stimulus for a source is calculated by weighting its spectral irradiance $E_{\\lambda}$ with the melanopic sensitivity function $\\bar{m}(\\lambda)$.

Mathematically:\n$$M_{e, \\mathrm{source}} = M_{e, \\mathrm{D65}}(E_{\\mathrm{v,D65}} = E_{\\mathrm{mel,EDI}})$$\n\n**Principle 4: Melanopic-to-photopic ratio ($r$)**\nThe melanopic-to-photopic ratio, $r$, is defined for the test source as the ratio of its \"melanopic weighted quantity\" to its photopic illuminance, $E_{\\mathrm{v}}$.\n$$r = \\frac{\\text{melanopic weighted quantity}}{E_{\\mathrm{v}}}$$\n\nThe critical step is to correctly interpret the term \"melanopic weighted quantity\". Principle 2 specifies that this quantity is made \"comparable across spectra\" by being \"normalized to the CIE Standard Daylight (D65) reference.\" This process of normalization to a reference light source (D65) to yield a value in units of illuminance (lux) is precisely the definition of Equivalent Daylight Illuminance.

The problem states that CBTmin occurs approximately $2$ hours before the habitual wake time. The therapy aims to entrain the patient to the desired wake time, so we use $t_{\\text{wake}}$ as the reference for the habitual wake time.\n$$t_{\\text{CBTmin}} = t_{\\text{wake}} - 2 \\text{ hours}$$\nSubstituting the value for $t_{\\text{wake}}$:\n$$t_{\\text{CBTmin}} = 6.5 - 2 = 4.5 \\text{ hours}$$\nThis corresponds to a clock time of $04{:}30$.\n\nThe second physiological fact relates the timing of the maximal phase-advance response to the timing of CBTmin.
