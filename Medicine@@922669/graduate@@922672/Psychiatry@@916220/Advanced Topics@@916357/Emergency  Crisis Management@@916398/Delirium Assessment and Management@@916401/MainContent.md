## Introduction
Delirium is a common and severe neuropsychiatric syndrome that frequently complicates the course of medically ill patients, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Despite its prevalence, it remains widely under-recognized and often mismanaged. This article addresses this critical knowledge gap by providing a structured, mechanistically grounded, and evidence-based framework for the assessment and management of delirium. It is designed to equip clinicians with the theoretical understanding and practical skills necessary to improve patient outcomes.

Across the following chapters, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of this complex condition. The first chapter, **"Principles and Mechanisms,"** will dissect the core diagnostic criteria, explore the pathophysiological pathways involving inflammation and neurotransmitter imbalance, and explain the neurobiological basis for delirium's clinical signs. The second chapter, **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections,"** will translate this foundational knowledge into real-world practice, detailing systematic diagnostic workups, the central role of non-pharmacologic interventions, the nuanced use of medications, and the critical ethical dimensions of care. Finally, the **"Hands-On Practices"** section will provide opportunities to apply and solidify these key clinical skills through practical problem-solving exercises.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delineates the fundamental principles and neurobiological mechanisms that define delirium. Moving from the formal diagnostic criteria, we will explore its varied clinical presentations, dissect the complex interplay of risk factors, and delve into the pathophysiological cascades at the network, cellular, and neurochemical levels. The ultimate aim is to construct a rigorous, mechanistically grounded framework for understanding, assessing, and managing this complex neuropsychiatric syndrome.

### Defining the Syndrome: Core Clinical Features and a Key Distinction

The diagnosis of delirium rests on a set of criteria that precisely define it as a neurocognitive syndrome secondary to a direct physiological insult. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), the diagnosis requires the fulfillment of five core criteria. First, a **disturbance in attention and awareness** (Criterion A) is obligatory. This manifests as a reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention, coupled with reduced orientation to the environment. Second, the disturbance must develop over a **short period (acute onset)**, typically hours to a few days, representing a distinct change from the individual's baseline, and it must **tend to fluctuate in severity** during the course of the day (Criterion B). Third, an **additional disturbance in cognition** must be present, such as deficits in memory, language, visuospatial ability, or perception (Criterion C). Fourth, these disturbances cannot be better explained by a pre-existing neurocognitive disorder and must not occur in the context of a severely reduced level of arousal, such as a coma (Criterion D). Finally, and crucially, there must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is a **direct physiological consequence** of another medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal, exposure to a toxin, or multiple etiologies (Criterion E) [@problem_id:4705651].

Among these criteria, the acute, fluctuating disturbance in attention and awareness forms the bedrock of the diagnosis. This phenomenological core is essential for distinguishing delirium from its most common mimic: major neurocognitive disorder (MND), or dementia. Whereas delirium is defined by its acute onset over hours to days and a fluctuating course, MND is typically characterized by an insidious onset over months to years with a steadily progressive course. Furthermore, while both conditions involve cognitive deficits, the nature of the attentional impairment is a key [differentiator](@entry_id:272992). In delirium, a prominent, fluctuating deficit in attention is a cardinal and defining feature. In contrast, for many common forms of MND like Alzheimer's disease, attention and level of consciousness are relatively preserved in the early stages of the illness [@problem_id:4705651].

### The Phenomenological Spectrum: Motor Subtypes and Arousal

While the core cognitive features define delirium, its behavioral expression is heterogeneous. This variability is formally captured in the classification of delirium into motor subtypes, which provides a more granular description of the clinical presentation and has prognostic and management implications. This taxonomy is anchored in the observable dimensions of psychomotor activity and level of arousal.

The three primary motor subtypes are:

*   **Hyperactive Delirium**: This subtype is characterized by increased psychomotor activity relative to the patient's baseline. Clinically, this manifests as restlessness, agitation, pacing, picking at bedclothes, or pulling at intravenous lines and catheters. This heightened motor output is the behavioral correlate of a state of hyperarousal, often reflected in positive scores on the observational scales like the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS).

*   **Hypoactive Delirium**: This subtype is characterized by decreased psychomotor activity. Patients may appear lethargic, drowsy, or stuporous, with slowed movements, a paucity of spontaneous speech, and apathy. This state of psychomotor retardation reflects diminished arousal, or hypoarousal, corresponding to negative scores on the RASS. Hypoactive delirium is more common, particularly in older adults, yet it is frequently under-recognized due to its non-disruptive nature, leading to poorer outcomes.

*   **Mixed Delirium**: This subtype features rapid and unpredictable fluctuations between hyperactive and hypoactive states, sometimes within the same day or even over hours. A patient might be agitated and restless in the morning, only to become lethargic and difficult to arouse in the afternoon.

This motor subtype taxonomy is not merely descriptive; it operationalizes the arousal dimension of delirium. The level of arousal is neurobiologically mediated by the **Ascending Reticular Activating System (ARAS)**, a brainstem network whose projections to the thalamus and cortex regulate wakefulness. In delirium, disruption of ARAS function and neuromodulatory balance leads to an unstable arousal set-point, which in turn shapes the observable psychomotor output. Therefore, subtyping by motor activity provides a direct clinical "readout" of this fundamental neurophysiological dysregulation [@problem_id:4705697].

### The Pathophysiological Cascade: From Systemic Insult to Network Failure

Delirium is rarely caused by a single factor. Instead, it arises from a complex interaction between a patient's underlying vulnerabilities and acute physiological stressors. Understanding this interplay is key to both risk assessment and prevention.

#### The Multiplicative Risk Model: Vulnerability and Precipitants

The development of delirium is best conceptualized through a **stress-diathesis model**, where the risk is determined by the interplay of predisposing and precipitating factors.

*   **Predisposing Factors** are baseline characteristics that confer vulnerability by lowering an individual's "neural reserve"—the brain's capacity to withstand physiological stress. These are typically chronic and include advanced age, pre-existing dementia, clinical frailty (e.g., [sarcopenia](@entry_id:152946), slow gait), and sensory impairment (poor vision or hearing) [@problem_id:4705632].

*   **Precipitating Factors** are the acute noxious insults that trigger delirium in a vulnerable brain. Common precipitants include infection, surgery, metabolic derangements (e.g., hypoxia, hyponatremia), and exposure to psychoactive medications, particularly those with anticholinergic properties or opioids [@problem_id:4705632].

The combined risk from these factors is not simply additive; it is **multiplicative**. This is because a vulnerable brain with low neural reserve has a much lower threshold for dysfunction. An insult that a healthy brain could easily tolerate may be sufficient to push a vulnerable brain into a state of delirium. Statistically, this is reflected in [logistic regression](@entry_id:136386) models where risk factors contribute additively on the [log-odds](@entry_id:141427) scale. When converted to odds, the effect becomes multiplicative: the total odds of delirium are approximately the product of the odds ratios of the individual risk factors present. This has a profound clinical implication: in a highly vulnerable patient, removing even a single modifiable precipitant can produce a disproportionately large reduction in overall risk [@problem_id:4705632].

#### The Inflammation Hypothesis: A Causal Pathway

One of the most robustly supported theories for how systemic insults translate into brain dysfunction is the inflammation hypothesis. Systemic inflammation, such as that occurring during an infection, can initiate a cascade of events leading to delirium. This can be formalized into a causal model. Systemic inflammation ($I$), marked by elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin-6 (IL-6), disrupts the tight junctions of the cerebrovascular endothelium. This increases the permeability of the **Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)** ($B$). The compromised BBB allows peripheral immune mediators and cytokines to enter the central nervous system, where they trigger the activation of **microglia** ($M$), the brain's resident immune cells. Activated microglia alter synaptic function, disrupt [neuronal communication](@entry_id:173993), and ultimately degrade the efficiency of **large-scale [brain network](@entry_id:268668) integration** ($G$). This failure of network communication manifests clinically as the cognitive and attentional deficits of **delirium** ($D$) [@problem_id:4705680]. This causal chain, $I \to B \to M \to G \to D$, provides a powerful framework for understanding how a peripheral process like pneumonia can precipitate a profound central nervous system syndrome.

#### The Final Common Pathway: Neurotransmitter Imbalance

While network disruption is the ultimate outcome, the proximate cause often lies in the dysregulation of key [neurotransmitter systems](@entry_id:172168) that are critical for attention, arousal, and cognition. This is often described as the "final common pathway" of delirium. The two most critically implicated systems are acetylcholine and dopamine.

The **cholinergic deficiency hypothesis** posits that a reduction in central cholinergic activity is a primary driver of delirium. Acetylcholine (ACh), particularly from the basal forebrain (e.g., nucleus basalis of Meynert), is crucial for modulating attention. It enhances the cortical **[signal-to-noise ratio](@entry_id:271196) ($S/N$)** by increasing the gain of responses to relevant stimuli while suppressing distractors. Any process that reduces cholinergic transmission—such as the administration of anticholinergic medications (e.g., diphenhydramine, oxybutynin) or metabolic insults that impair ACh synthesis—will lower the cortical $S/N$, crippling top-down attentional control and leading to distractibility and confusion [@problem_id:4705696].

Conversely, the **dopaminergic excess hypothesis** suggests that a relative overactivity of dopamine contributes to delirium, particularly its psychotic features. Dopamine modulates **cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) loops**, which are involved in [action selection](@entry_id:151649) and salience attribution. Excessive dopaminergic tone, which can be iatrogenically induced (e.g., by levodopa treatment for Parkinson's disease) or result from other neurochemical imbalances, destabilizes thalamic gating. This allows irrelevant internal or external stimuli to be aberrantly flagged as salient, flooding the cortex with "noise." This bottom-up attentional failure can manifest as distractibility, disorganized thought, and sensory misperceptions or hallucinations [@problem_id:4705696].

These two mechanisms often act in concert. Consider an elderly patient with Parkinson's disease (vulnerable brain) who, post-surgery (precipitating inflammatory insult), is given an anticholinergic medication and has their levodopa dose increased. The anticholinergic drug cripples top-down attentional filtering by reducing the $S/N$, while the dopamine excess overwhelms bottom-up salience processing. The synergistic collapse of both top-down and bottom-up attentional systems precipitates a severe delirium [@problem_id:4705696].

### Mechanisms of Disrupted Brain Function: From Networks to Neurons

The pathophysiological processes described above have direct, measurable consequences on the brain's electrical activity and functional integrity.

#### Thalamocortical Dysregulation: The Hub of Inattention

The attentional deficit in delirium is not a vague or abstract concept; it is a direct consequence of the failure of specific neural circuits. Sustained and selective attention depend on the integrity of a large-scale network involving the ARAS, the thalamus, and frontoparietal cortical regions. The thalamus, in particular, acts as a critical gatekeeper, filtering sensory information and coordinating cortical activity under the modulatory influence of cholinergic and other [neurotransmitter systems](@entry_id:172168). Bedside attention tasks, such as reciting the months of the year in reverse or performing serial subtractions, are not arbitrary cognitive tests; they are designed to directly stress this **ARAS–thalamus–frontoparietal circuit**. In delirium, the disruption of thalamocortical gain control and [synchronization](@entry_id:263918) leads to performance deficits characterized by attentional lapses, perseverative errors, and intrusion of irrelevant thoughts. The profound sensitivity of these tasks to the delirious state underscores the fact that delirium is, at its core, a disorder of thalamocortical network integrity [@problem_id:4705688].

#### The Electrophysiological Signature: Diffuse EEG Slowing

The global disruption of brain function in delirium can be objectively visualized using electroencephalography (EEG). The hallmark EEG finding in most cases of delirium is **diffuse slowing**. This is characterized by an increase in the power of slow-wave frequencies, namely delta ($1$-$4$ Hz) and theta ($4$-$7$ Hz), and a concurrent slowing, disorganization, or attenuation of the normal resting-state **posterior dominant rhythm (PDR)** in the alpha band ($8$-$12$ Hz) [@problem_id:4705718].

This shift to slow-wave activity has a well-defined cellular basis in thalamocortical dysregulation. In a normal, wakeful state, tonic activating input from cholinergic and other ARAS nuclei keeps thalamocortical relay neurons in a relatively depolarized state. This enables a **tonic firing mode**, where neurons faithfully transmit information to the cortex. In delirium, the reduction of this neuromodulatory drive (e.g., due to cholinergic deficiency) leads to **[hyperpolarization](@entry_id:171603)** of these same thalamic neurons. This hyperpolarization removes the inactivation of low-threshold T-type $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. Now, any small excitatory input can trigger a large calcium spike, leading to a high-frequency **burst firing mode**. When large populations of thalamic neurons enter this mode, they fire in synchronized bursts, imposing a powerful, low-frequency rhythm onto the entire cortex. This large-scale, pathological [synchronization](@entry_id:263918) manifests on the scalp EEG as high-amplitude, diffuse slow waves [@problem_id:4705718]. This elegant mechanism directly links the neurotransmitter hypotheses (e.g., reduced ACh) to the network-level dysfunction (thalamocortical dysrhythmia) and its objective electrophysiological signature (EEG slowing) [@problem_id:4705718] [@problem_id:4705696].

### Translating Principles to Practice: Assessment and Differential Diagnosis

A firm grasp of these principles is essential for accurate clinical assessment. The diagnostic process involves not only identifying the core features of delirium but also distinguishing it from other conditions and adapting the assessment to complex clinical scenarios.

#### Operationalizing the Diagnosis: The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)

The DSM-5-TR criteria provide the conceptual foundation, but for rapid and reliable bedside assessment, a standardized tool is invaluable. The **Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)** is a widely used instrument designed to operationalize these criteria. It assesses four cardinal features:
*   $F_1$: Acute onset and fluctuating course
*   $F_2$: Inattention
*   $F_3$: Disorganized thinking
*   $F_4$: Altered level of consciousness

The CAM diagnostic algorithm has a precise logical structure: a diagnosis of delirium is made if and only if both Feature 1 AND Feature 2 are present, in addition to EITHER Feature 3 OR Feature 4. This can be expressed as the logical predicate $(F_1 \land F_2) \land (F_3 \lor F_4)$. The mandatory nature of $F_1$ and $F_2$ stems directly from the fact that they are the operational counterparts to the two foundational pillars of the delirium diagnosis: acute/fluctuating course and disturbance of attention, respectively [@problem_id:4705708].

#### Key Differential Diagnoses

Accurate diagnosis requires careful differentiation from other syndromes with overlapping features.

*   **Delirium vs. Primary Psychotic Disorders**: While patients with delirium may exhibit psychotic symptoms like hallucinations or delusions, the clinical picture is distinct from a primary psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia). The key differentiators are the core features of delirium itself. Delirium has an abrupt onset (hours to days), a fluctuating course, and a primary, profound impairment of attention and awareness. In contrast, primary psychotic disorders typically have a more subacute or chronic onset (weeks to months), a less rapidly fluctuating course, and relatively preserved attention and orientation outside of periods of severe agitation. Most importantly, delirium by definition requires an identifiable medical precipitant, which is absent in primary psychosis [@problem_id:4705709]. A robust assessment checklist to avoid false positives would therefore emphasize confirming an acute change from baseline, repeatedly testing attention to document impairment and fluctuation, screening for medical causes, and carefully ruling out confounders like severe sensory impairment, aphasia, or the effects of sedating medications [@problem_id:4705709].

*   **Delirium Superimposed on Dementia (DSD)**: Perhaps the most common and challenging diagnostic scenario is identifying an acute delirium in a patient with a pre-existing dementia. In DSD, the key is to distinguish the patient's **acute** changes from their **chronic** baseline deficits. A patient with Alzheimer's disease may be chronically disoriented to the date, but an acute delirium might manifest as new-onset inattention (e.g., inability to follow a simple conversation they could previously), a fluctuating level of consciousness, or new perceptual disturbances. The assessment must therefore be adapted. The first and most critical step is to obtain a **detailed informant history** from family or caregivers to establish the patient's specific baseline cognitive and functional status. Second, the clinical environment should be optimized to **correct for sensory deficits** (e.g., ensuring hearing aids and glasses are used) to avoid misattributing sensory-related confusion to delirium. Third, assessment should prioritize **objective attention testing** (e.g., digit span backward) and should be repeated at different times of day to capture fluctuation. Finally, validated tools like the CAM can be used, but the clinician must anchor their judgments for "acute change" and "fluctuation" firmly to the established baseline [@problem_id:4705636]. It is the acute deviation from this baseline, in the context of a new medical stressor, that signals the presence of a superimposed delirium.
