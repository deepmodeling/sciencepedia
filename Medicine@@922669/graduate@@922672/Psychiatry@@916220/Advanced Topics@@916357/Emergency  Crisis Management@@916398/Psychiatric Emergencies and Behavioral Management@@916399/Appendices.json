The clinical scenario, differentiating delirium from primary psychosis in an elderly patient, is common and realistic. The provided signs (attention impairment, visual hallucinations, autonomic instability) and their associated likelihood ratios are clinically plausible, reflecting the expected features of delirium over late-onset primary psychosis. The sum of prior probabilities is $0.30 + 0.70 = 1$, which is logically consistent for a binary diagnostic frame.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary data (priors, likelihood ratios) and a critical assumption (conditional independence) to arrive at a unique solution. The objective is clearly stated.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is described using precise, objective clinical and statistical language, free from bias or subjective interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in applied probability. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation of a posterior probability, which is a direct application of Bayes' theorem. Let $D_P$ be the event that the patient has primary psychosis and $D_D$ be the event that the patient has delirium. Let $E$ represent the conjunction of the three observed findings: $E = E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap E_3$, where $E_1$ is attention impairment, $E_2$ is visual hallucinations, and $E_3$ is autonomic instability.\n\nWe are asked to compute $P(D_P|E)$. The most efficient method for this problem, which provides likelihood ratios, is the odds form of Bayes' theorem.\n\nThe posterior odds of psychosis versus delirium given the evidence $E$ are related to the prior odds by the overall likelihood ratio:\n$$ \\frac{P(D_P|E)}{P(D_D|E)} = \\frac{P(E|D_P)}{P(E|D_D)} \\times \\frac{P(D_P)}{P(D_D)} $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Likelihood Ratio} \\times \\text{Prior Odds} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the prior odds in favor of psychosis over delirium. The prior probabilities are given as $P(D_P)=0.30$ and $P(D_D)=0.70$.\n$$ \\text{Prior Odds} = \\frac{P(D_P)}{P(D_D)} = \\frac{0.30}{0.70} = \\frac{3}{7} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the overall likelihood ratio for the combined evidence $E = E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap E_3$. The problem states that the findings are conditionally independent given the diagnosis. This assumption allows us to express the joint conditional probability as the product of the individual conditional probabilities:\n$$ P(E|D_k) = P(E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap E_3 | D_k) = P(E_1|D_k) \\times P(E_2|D_k) \\times P(E_3|D_k) $$\nwhere $D_k$ can be either $D_P$ or $D_D$.\n\nTherefore, the overall likelihood ratio, $LR_{\\text{total}}$, is the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{P(E|D_P)}{P(E|D_D)} = \\frac{P(E_1|D_P)P(E_2|D_P)P(E_3|D_P)}{P(E_1|D_D)P(E_2|D_D)P(E_3|D_D)} $$\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = \\left(\\frac{P(E_1|D_P)}{P(E_1|D_D)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(E_2|D_P)}{P(E_2|D_D)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(E_3|D_P)}{P(E_3|D_D)}\\right) $$\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = LR_1 \\times LR_2 \\times LR_3 $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = 0.25 \\times 0.35 \\times 0.20 $$\n$$ LR_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{35}{100} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{7}{20} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{7}{400} = 0.0175 $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the total likelihood ratio:\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Prior Odds} \\times LR_{\\text{total}} $$\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\frac{3}{7} \\times \\frac{7}{400} = \\frac{3}{400} = 0.0075 $$\n\nFinally, we convert the posterior odds back to a probability. If the posterior odds in favor of an event $A$ are $O_{\\text{post}}$, the posterior probability of $A$ is given by:\n$$ P(A|\\text{evidence}) = \\frac{O_{\\text{post}}}{1 + O_{\\text{post}}} $$\nIn our case, $A$ is the diagnosis $D_P$ and the evidence is $E$:\n$$ P(D_P|E) = \\frac{\\text{Posterior Odds}}{1 + \\text{Posterior Odds}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{400}}{1 + \\frac{3}{400}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{400}}{\\frac{403}{400}} = \\frac{3}{403} $$\n\nTo provide the final answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$ P(D_P|E) = \\frac{3}{403} \\approx 0.0074441687... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.007444$.\n\nThis result indicates that given the three clinical findings, which are all more suggestive of delirium than psychosis, the probability that the patient has a primary psychosis has decreased dramatically from the prior probability of $0.30$ to approximately $0.007444$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.007444}$$", "id": "4746466"}, {"introduction": "The management of alcohol withdrawal is a fundamental skill in emergency psychiatry, aimed at safely mitigating a potentially life-threatening condition.

The use of ketamine for severe agitation and the specified dosing range are consistent with established medical practice. The principle of weight-based dosing is a fundamental concept in pharmacology. The clinical reasoning concerning co-ingestants and the subsequent adjustment of the dose is sound. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data—patient weight, a dosing range, and a clear, objective criterion for selecting the specific dose coefficient—to calculate a unique answer. The language is objective and free of non-scientific claims. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Verdict**\nThe problem is valid.\n\n**Solution: Dose Calculation**\n\nThe total dose, $D$, of a medication administered based on body weight is calculated as the product of the patient's mass, $m$, and the chosen dose per unit mass, $d$.\n$$D = m \\times d$$\nThe givens are:\n-   Patient mass, $m = 90 \\text{ kg}$.\n-   Recommended dosing range, which can be expressed as an interval $[d_{\\min}, d_{\\max}] = [4 \\text{ mg/kg}, 5 \\text{ mg/kg}]$.\n\nThe institutional policy provides a clear, deterministic rule for selecting the appropriate dose coefficient, $d$, from this range. Due to the inability to exclude co-ingestion of CNS depressants, the policy mandates the use of the lower bound of the recommended range.\nTherefore, the selected dose coefficient is:\n$$d = d_{\\min} = 4 \\text{ mg/kg}$$\nSubstituting the values of $m$ and $d$ into the dosing equation:\n$$D = 90 \\text{ kg} \\times 4 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}}$$\n$$D = 360 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $360$. The number $360$ can be represented as $3.60 \\times 10^{2}$, which has three significant figures. Therefore, the value $360$ meets the specified precision requirement.\n\n**Solution: First-Principles Justification for Monitoring**\n\nFollowing administration of a dissociative dose of ketamine, particularly in a patient with an unknown history of co-ingestants, immediate implementation of airway precautions and continuous monitoring is a critical safety requirement. This is justified by principles from the sedation continuum, respiratory physiology, and ketamine's specific pharmacology.\n\n1.  **Sedation Continuum and Dissociative State:** Sedation exists on a continuum from minimal sedation (anxiolysis) to general anesthesia. A dissociative dose of ketamine induces a functional state analogous in risk to deep sedation or general anesthesia. In this state, the patient is unresponsive to verbal commands and most external stimuli. Crucially, their ability to maintain a patent airway and independently manage respiratory function may be impaired or lost. The transition into and out of this state can be unpredictable. Continuous monitoring is essential to detect if the patient has entered an unintended, deeper level of sedation where protective airway reflexes (e.g., coughing, swallowing) are lost, increasing the risk of aspiration or obstruction.\n\n2.  **Respiratory Physiology:**\n    -   **Airway Patency:** The primary mechanism of respiratory compromise in a non-responsive patient is mechanical obstruction. The loss of pharyngeal muscle tone allows the tongue to fall back and occlude the airway (glossoptosis). Furthermore, protective reflexes that clear saliva and other secretions are blunted, which can lead to pooling of secretions, laryngospasm, or aspiration of gastric contents. These risks mandate readiness for airway maneuvers (e.g., jaw-thrust, suctioning) or advanced airway management.\n    -   **Respiratory Drive:** The central respiratory drive, controlled by the brainstem, can be suppressed by sedative agents. While ketamine is renowned for generally preserving respiratory drive compared to other agents like propofol or benzodiazepines, this effect is not absolute. High doses or, critically in this case, synergy with co-ingested CNS depressants (e.g., opioids, alcohol, benzodiazepines) can lead to significant respiratory depression, manifesting as hypoventilation (inadequate breathing leading to a rise in arterial CO$_2$) or apnea (complete cessation of breathing).\n\n3.  **Ketamine's Pharmacology and the Role of Co-Ingestants:** Ketamine's primary cardiorespiratory advantage is its sympathomimetic effect and preservation of respiratory drive. However, this favorable profile can be negated by several factors:\n    -   **Synergistic Depression:** This is the paramount concern in this scenario. The problem explicitly states that co-ingestion of CNS depressants cannot be excluded. Substances like opioids or benzodiazepines are potent respiratory depressants. When combined with ketamine, they can act synergistically to cause profound hypoventilation or apnea, overriding ketamine's typically protective respiratory effects.\n    -   **Hypersalivation:** Ketamine is known to increase salivary and bronchial secretions, which can physically obstruct the airway or trigger laryngospasm, an involuntary, spastic closure of the vocal cords that constitutes a life-threatening airway emergency.\n    -   **Emesis and Aspiration:** While sedated, the patient loses the ability to protect their airway if vomiting occurs, creating a high risk of aspirating gastric contents into the lungs, leading to severe chemical pneumonitis.\n\n**Required Monitoring and Rationale:**\nBased on these principles, the following continuous monitoring is required:\n-   **Continuous Pulse Oximetry ($\\text{SpO}_2$):** To provide an immediate alarm for oxygen desaturation (hypoxemia), which is a late sign of respiratory failure.\n-   **Continuous Quantitative Waveform Capnography ($\\text{EtCO}_2$):** This is the standard of care for procedural sedation. It measures end-tidal carbon dioxide, providing a real-time, breath-by-breath measure of ventilation. It is the most sensitive monitor for detecting hypoventilation or apnea, often alerting clinicians to a problem minutes before pulse oximetry would show a change.\n-   **Continuous Electrocardiography (ECG):** To monitor heart rate and rhythm. The patient's underlying condition (stimulant intoxication) and the administered drug (ketamine) both have significant cardiovascular effects.\n-   **Frequent Non-Invasive Blood Pressure (NIBP):** To monitor for hypertension (common with ketamine) or hypotension (which could indicate underlying shock or effects from co-ingestants).\n-   **Constant clinical observation** by a trained provider is non-negotiable to assess respiratory effort, airway patency, and level of consciousness.\n\nIn summary, the uncertainty regarding co-ingested substances transforms a relatively safe procedure into a high-risk one, mandating vigilant monitoring to anticipate and promptly manage potential airway and respiratory collapse.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{360}$$", "id": "4746489"}]}
