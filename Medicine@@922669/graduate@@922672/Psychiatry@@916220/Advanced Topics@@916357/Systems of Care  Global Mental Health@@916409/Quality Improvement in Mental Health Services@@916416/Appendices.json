In each week, the denominator varies because the number of medication administrations changes with census and acuity. Let each administration be a Bernoulli trial with probability $p$ of an error. Over a stable $52$-week baseline, the team estimated the process center as $\\hat{p}=0.06$. For a new audit week with $n=200$ administrations, construct the $3$-standard-deviation control limits for the p-chart for that week from first principles, starting from the Bernoulli and Binomial models and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). Then compute the numerical values of the lower control limit (LCL) and upper control limit (UCL) for that week using the baseline estimate $\\hat{p}=0.06$ and the week’s denominator $n=200$. If a limit falls outside the interval $[0,1]$, truncate it to the nearest boundary of that interval.

The underlying probabilistic models (Bernoulli, Binomial) and the use of the Central Limit Theorem are the correct theoretical foundations. The application to medication error monitoring is a classic example of quality improvement in healthcare. The provided numerical values, $\\hat{p}=0.06$ and $n=200$, are realistic.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined and provides all necessary information to derive and calculate the control limits: the baseline proportion estimate ($\\hat{p}$), the sample size for the week in question ($n$), and the multiple for the standard deviation (3-sigma limits). The objective is unambiguous.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of any subjective or opinion-based assertions.\n\nThe problem is free of the listed flaws: it is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, and well-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe construction of control limits for a p-chart from first principles begins with the underlying stochastic process.\n\n1.  **Bernoulli Trial**: Each medication administration is modeled as an independent Bernoulli trial. Let $X_i$ be a random variable representing the outcome of the $i$-th administration, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. We define $X_i = 1$ if a medication error occurs (a \"nonconforming\" event) and $X_i = 0$ otherwise. The probability of an error is $P(X_i=1) = p$. The mean and variance of this trial are:\n    $$E[X_i] = p$$\n    $$\\text{Var}(X_i) = p(1-p)$$\n\n2.  **Binomial Distribution**: The total number of errors, $Y$, in a sample of $n$ administrations is the sum of these independent Bernoulli trials: $Y = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$. Thus, $Y$ follows a Binomial distribution, $Y \\sim \\text{Bin}(n, p)$. The mean and variance of $Y$ are:\n    $$E[Y] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i] = np$$\n    $$\\text{Var}(Y) = \\text{Var}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{Var}(X_i) = np(1-p)$$\n\n3.  **Sample Proportion**: The p-chart tracks the sample proportion of errors, which we denote as $\\hat{p}_{sample}$ for a given week. This is calculated as the number of errors divided by the total number of administrations:\n    $$\\hat{p}_{sample} = \\frac{Y}{n}$$\n    The expected value (mean) of the sample proportion is:\n    $$E[\\hat{p}_{sample}] = E\\left[\\frac{Y}{n}\\right] = \\frac{1}{n}E[Y] = \\frac{np}{n} = p$$\n    The variance of the sample proportion is:\n    $$\\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_{sample}) = \\text{Var}\\left[\\frac{Y}{n}\\right] = \\frac{1}{n^2}\\text{Var}(Y) = \\frac{np(1-p)}{n^2} = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$$\n    The standard deviation of the sample proportion, known as its standard error, is therefore:\n    $$\\sigma_{\\hat{p}_{sample}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$$\n\n4.  **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**: For a sufficiently large sample size $n$, the Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sample proportion $\\hat{p}_{sample}$ is approximately Normal, with the mean and variance derived above.\n    $$\\hat{p}_{sample} \\approx N\\left(\\mu = p, \\sigma^2 = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}\\right)$$\n    The approximation is generally considered valid when $np \\geq 5$ and $n(1-p) \\geq 5$.\n\n5.  **Control Limits Construction**: The $3$-standard-deviation ($3$-sigma) control limits for any process are defined as $\\mu \\pm 3\\sigma$. For the p-chart, the process mean is $p$ and the process standard deviation is $\\sigma_{\\hat{p}_{sample}}$. In practice, the true process proportion $p$ is unknown and is estimated by the center line $\\hat{p}$ derived from stable baseline data.\n    The formulas for the control limits are:\n    -   Center Line (CL): $\\hat{p}$\n    -   Upper Control Limit (UCL): $\\hat{p} + 3\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}$\n    -   Lower Control Limit (LCL): $\\hat{p} - 3\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}$\n\nNow, we will compute the numerical values for the specific audit week.\n\n**Given values**:\n-   Baseline process proportion estimate: $\\hat{p} = 0.06$\n-   Sample size for the week: $n = 200$\n\nFirst, we verify the conditions for the Normal approximation using our estimates:\n-   $n\\hat{p} = 200 \\times 0.06 = 12$. Since $12 \\geq 5$, this condition is met.\n-   $n(1-\\hat{p}) = 200 \\times (1 - 0.06) = 200 \\times 0.94 = 188$. Since $188 \\geq 5$, this condition is also met.\nThe use of the CLT and the Normal approximation is justified.\n\nNext, we calculate the standard error for the sample proportion for this week:\n$$\\sigma_{\\hat{p}_{sample}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.06(1 - 0.06)}{200}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.06 \\times 0.94}{200}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0564}{200}} = \\sqrt{0.000282}$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\hat{p}_{sample}} \\approx 0.0167928556$$\n\nNow we calculate the $3$-sigma limits:\n-   **UCL**:\n    $$\\text{UCL} = \\hat{p} + 3\\sigma_{\\hat{p}_{sample}} = 0.06 + 3 \\times 0.0167928556 = 0.06 + 0.0503785668 = 0.1103785668$$\n-   **LCL**:\n    $$\\text{LCL} = \\hat{p} - 3\\sigma_{\\hat{p}_{sample}} = 0.06 - 3 \\times 0.0167928556 = 0.06 - 0.0503785668 = 0.0096214332$$\n\nThe calculated limits are $\\text{LCL} \\approx 0.00962$ and $\\text{UCL} \\approx 0.1104$. Both limits are within the valid interval for a proportion, $[0, 1]$. Therefore, no truncation is necessary.\n\nFinally, we round the results to four significant figures as required:\n-   $\\text{LCL} = 0.0096214332 \\rightarrow 0.009621$\n-   $\\text{UCL} = 0.1103785668 \\rightarrow 0.1104$\n\nThe control limits for the audit week with $n=200$ are $\\text{LCL} = 0.009621$ and $\\text{UCL} = 0.1104$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.009621  0.1104\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4752709"}, {"introduction": "Once we can measure performance, a common objective is to compare outcomes across different services or hospitals.

The strata and their reference baseline probabilities are: Stratum $1$: low severity, no SUD, stable housing, $p_1 = 0.08$; Stratum $2$: moderate severity or SUD, stable housing, $p_2 = 0.15$; Stratum $3$: high severity with SUD or unstable housing, $p_3 = 0.25$; Stratum $4$: very high severity with multimorbidity and unstable housing, $p_4 = 0.35$.

It is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and contains all necessary information. Therefore, a full analysis is warranted.\n\nThe core task is to compare the performance of two psychiatric hospitals, Alpha and Beta, based on their $30$-day readmission rates, while accounting for differences in their patient populations, a concept known as \"case-mix.\"\n\nFirst, we define the key terms based on first principles in epidemiology.\n- **Unadjusted Readmission Rate ($\\hat{r}$)**: This is the overall proportion of patients readmitted, calculated as the total number of observed readmissions ($Y$) divided by the total number of discharges ($N$). It is a crude measure that does not account for patient-level risk factors.\n- **Case-Mix**: This refers to the distribution of patient characteristics that influence the outcome of interest (readmission). In this problem, the case-mix is the distribution of patients across the four risk strata, given by the counts $(n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4)$ for each hospital. A hospital with a higher proportion of patients in high-risk strata (e.g., Strata $3$ and $4$) is said to have a more challenging or \"sicker\" case-mix.\n- **Risk Adjustment**: This is the process of accounting for differences in case-mix to allow for a fairer comparison of outcomes between providers. A common method is to compare the observed number of events to an expected number.\n- **Expected Readmissions ($E$)**: This is the number of readmissions that would be expected in a hospital if its patients experienced the reference, stratum-specific readmission probabilities ($p_i$). Using the law of total expectation, it is calculated as the sum of the products of the number of patients in each stratum ($n_i$) and the reference probability for that stratum ($p_i$): $E = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} n_i p_i$.\n- **Standardized Readmission Ratio (SRR)**: This is a risk-adjusted measure of performance, defined as the ratio of observed readmissions ($Y$) to expected readmissions ($E$). $SRR = Y/E$. An $SRR  1$ indicates that the hospital had more readmissions than expected for its case-mix (poorer performance), while an $SRR  1$ indicates fewer readmissions than expected (better performance).\n- **Confounding**: In this context, case-mix acts as a confounder. It is a variable that is associated with both the exposure (the hospital) and the outcome (readmission), but it is not on the causal pathway from hospital quality to readmission. If one hospital has a sicker case-mix than another, its unadjusted readmission rate may be higher simply due to the higher intrinsic risk of its patients, not necessarily due to lower quality of care. Comparing unadjusted rates without accounting for this confounding can lead to incorrect conclusions about hospital performance.\n\nWe now apply these principles to the data provided.\n\n**Hospital Alpha**\n- Total Discharges: $N_\\text{Alpha} = 400$\n- Observed Readmissions: $Y_\\text{Alpha} = 72$\n- Case-Mix Counts: $(n_{\\text{Alpha},1}, n_{\\text{Alpha},2}, n_{\\text{Alpha},3}, n_{\\text{Alpha},4}) = (60, 100, 180, 60)$\n- Reference Probabilities: $(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) = (0.08, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35)$\n\nUnadjusted Readmission Rate for Alpha:\n$$ \\hat{r}_\\text{Alpha} = \\frac{Y_\\text{Alpha}}{N_\\text{Alpha}} = \\frac{72}{400} = 0.18 $$\n\nExpected Readmissions for Alpha:\n$$ E_\\text{Alpha} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} n_{\\text{Alpha},i} p_i = (60 \\times 0.08) + (100 \\times 0.15) + (180 \\times 0.25) + (60 \\times 0.35) $$\n$$ E_\\text{Alpha} = 4.8 + 15 + 45 + 21 = 85.8 $$\n\nStandardized Readmission Ratio for Alpha:\n$$ SRR_\\text{Alpha} = \\frac{Y_\\text{Alpha}}{E_\\text{Alpha}} = \\frac{72}{85.8} \\approx 0.839 $$\n\n**Hospital Beta**\n- Total Discharges: $N_\\text{Beta} = 400$\n- Observed Readmissions: $Y_\\text{Beta} = 64$\n- Case-Mix Counts: $(n_{\\text{Beta},1}, n_{\\text{Beta},2}, n_{\\text{Beta},3}, n_{\\text{Beta},4}) = (200, 140, 50, 10)$\n- Reference Probabilities: $(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) = (0.08, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35)$\n\nUnadjusted Readmission Rate for Beta:\n$$ \\hat{r}_\\text{Beta} = \\frac{Y_\\text{Beta}}{N_\\text{Beta}} = \\frac{64}{400} = 0.16 $$\n\nExpected Readmissions for Beta:\n$$ E_\\text{Beta} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} n_{\\text{Beta},i} p_i = (200 \\times 0.08) + (140 \\times 0.15) + (50 \\times 0.25) + (10 \\times 0.35) $$\n$$ E_\\text{Beta} = 16 + 21 + 12.5 + 3.5 = 53.0 $$\n\nStandardized Readmission Ratio for Beta:\n$$ SRR_\\text{Beta} = \\frac{Y_\\text{Beta}}{E_\\text{Beta}} = \\frac{64}{53.0} \\approx 1.208 $$\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n- Unadjusted rates: $\\hat{r}_\\text{Alpha} = 18\\%$, $\\hat{r}_\\text{Beta} = 16\\%$. On this crude basis, Hospital Beta appears to perform better.\n- Case-Mix: Hospital Alpha has a much higher-risk patient population (a total of $180+60=240$ patients in the two highest risk strata) compared to Hospital Beta (a total of $50+10=60$ patients in those strata).\n- Risk-Adjusted Ratios: $SRR_\\text{Alpha} \\approx 0.839$ (less than $1$) and $SRR_\\text{Beta} \\approx 1.208$ (greater than $1$).

The difference in case-mix confounded the initial comparison.\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\nA. “Case-mix” is the joint distribution of patient-level covariates that causally or predictively influence readmission risk; “risk adjustment” estimates $E[\\text{readmissions} \\mid \\text{covariates}]$ to separate performance from patient risk. Using the stratum-specific baseline probabilities, Hospital Alpha’s standardized readmission ratio is less than $1$ while Hospital Beta’s is greater than $1$, so unadjusted rates mislead by favoring the easier case-mix hospital.\n- The definitions of \"case-mix\" and \"risk adjustment\" are conceptually correct and standard in the field.

This part of the statement is correct.\n- Hospital Beta has the easier case-mix (more patients in low-risk strata) and a lower unadjusted rate. The unadjusted rates do indeed mislead by making Beta look better. This statement is fully consistent with our analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. “Case-mix” refers to hospital-level process measures (e.g., length of stay and staffing) rather than patient-level characteristics; if $N_\\text{Alpha} = N_\\text{Beta}$, risk adjustment is unnecessary for fair comparison.\n- The definition of \"case-mix\" is incorrect. Case-mix refers to patient-level characteristics, not hospital-level processes. Hospital processes are often considered indicators of quality, the very thing being measured, not confounders to be adjusted for in this manner.\n- The claim that equal sample sizes ($N_\\text{Alpha} = N_\\text{Beta}$) obviate the need for risk adjustment is false. Equal total numbers of patients do not imply an equal distribution of risk factors within those patient populations, as demonstrated by the data in this problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. After risk adjustment based on the given strata, both hospitals perform equivalently because their observed rates are within $2\\%$ of each other.\n- The conclusion that \"both hospitals perform equivalently\" after risk adjustment is false. Our analysis shows that $SRR_\\text{Alpha}$ is substantially less than $1$ and $SRR_\\text{Beta}$ is substantially greater than $1$, indicating a clear difference in performance after adjustment.\n- The justification, \"because their observed rates are within $2\\%$ of each other\" ($\\hat{r}_\\text{Alpha}=18\\%$, $\\hat{r}_\\text{Beta}=16\\%$), refers to the unadjusted rates. This small unadjusted difference is irrelevant to the post-adjustment conclusion and, in fact, masks the true performance difference. The logic is flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. Unadjusted $30$-day readmission rates can mislead because they conflate differences in patient risk with differences in hospital performance; when expected readmissions differ across hospitals due to case-mix, comparing observed proportions alone introduces confounding.\n- This statement provides a precise and fundamental explanation of confounding in the context of hospital quality comparison. The unadjusted rate is a function of both patient risk and hospital performance.\n- The condition \"when expected readmissions differ across hospitals due to case-mix\" is met in our problem ($E_\\text{Alpha} = 85.8 \\neq E_\\text{Beta} = 53.0$).\n- The conclusion that \"comparing observed proportions alone introduces confounding\" is the correct epidemiological principle.

This is a well-tested linear-Gaussian model used in measurement contexts where true performance varies across units and observations have noise.\n\nDefinition and mechanism of regression to the mean: In a stable system where the true parameter $\\theta_i$ does not change, an extreme observed value $S_{i,t}$ is likely to have a substantial contribution from the noise term $\\epsilon_{i,t}$. Because $E[\\epsilon_{i,t+1}] = 0$ and $\\epsilon_{i,t+1}$ is independent of $\\epsilon_{i,t}$, the subsequent observation $S_{i,t+1}$ will, on average, remove the transient effect of the previous extreme noise realization. Formally, regression to the mean can be expressed in terms of conditional expectations: for extreme $S_{i,t}$, $E[S_{i,t+1}\\mid S_{i,t}]$ is closer to $\\mu$ than $S_{i,t}$ is, provided there is nonzero noise and finite between-trust variance.\n\nTo quantify $E[S_{i,t+1}\\mid S_{i,t}]$, we use the law of total expectation and properties of the normal-normal model.

If $s$ is extreme relative to $\\mu$, the shrinkage term pulls the posterior mean toward $\\mu$, which embodies regression to the mean.\n\nNumerical computation: With $\\mu = 80$, $\\tau^2 = 25$, $\\sigma^2 = 64$, and $S_{i,t} = 64$, we have $s - \\mu = 64 - 80 = -16$ and $w = \\frac{25}{25 + 64} = \\frac{25}{89}$. Therefore,\n$$\nE[\\theta_i\\mid S_{i,t} = 64] = 80 + \\frac{25}{89}\\cdot(-16) = 80 - \\frac{400}{89} \\approx 80 - 4.494 \\approx 75.506.\n$$\nBecause $E[S_{i,t+1}\\mid S_{i,t}] = E[\\theta_i\\mid S_{i,t}]$,\n$$\nE[S_{i,t+1}\\mid S_{i,t} = 64] \\approx 75.506,\n$$\nwhich is closer to $\\mu = 80$ than the extreme observed $64$ was. This is regression to the mean.\n\nImplications for league tables: When $\\sigma^2$ is large relative to $\\tau^2$ (that is, $\\sigma^2 \\gg \\tau^2$), $w = \\frac{\\tau^2}{\\tau^2 + \\sigma^2}$ is small, so the posterior mean pulls strongly toward $\\mu$, and $E[S_{i,t+1}\\mid S_{i,t}]$ shows substantial movement toward the mean. Consequently, ranks based solely on $S_{i,t}$ exhibit high volatility and can mislead stakeholders into attributing changes to true performance shifts in $\\theta_i$ when they are expected statistical artifacts.\n\nMitigation strategies are drawn from principles of statistical estimation and uncertainty communication: hierarchical modeling induces shrinkage toward $\\mu$, stabilizing extreme values; uncertainty intervals around $S_{i,t}$ and ranks reflect imprecision; multi-year rolling averages reduce $\\sigma^2$ through averaging, since the variance of an average of $k$ independent measurements is $\\sigma^2/k$, thus diminishing regression-driven fluctuations.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- A. This option correctly defines regression to the mean in the context of a stable underlying parameter with random noise and correctly states that $E[S_{i,t+1}\\mid S_{i,t}]$ lies between $S_{i,t}$ and $\\mu$ for extremes. The derivation above shows $E[S_{i,t+1}\\mid S_{i,t}] = \\mu + w(S_{i,t} - \\mu)$ with $0  w  1$, which is a value between $S_{i,t}$ and $\\mu$ unless $S_{i,t} = \\mu$. Verdict: Correct.\n- B. The numeric calculation matches the derived expression: $E[S_{i,t+1}\\mid S_{i,t} = 64] \\approx 75.506$, which rounds to approximately $75.5$. Verdict: Correct.\n- C. This option correctly identifies that ranks may misclassify improvement or deterioration because regression to the mean contributes to movement absent change in $\\theta_i$, and the effect is amplified when $\\sigma^2 \\gg \\tau^2$ (small $w$ yields strong shrinkage and ranking volatility). Verdict: Correct.\n- D. Equalizing sample sizes does not eliminate measurement noise; it may equalize $\\sigma^2$ across units but does not force $\\sigma^2 = 0$. Regression to the mean persists whenever $\\sigma^2  0$ and finite $\\tau^2$. Rank movements can still reflect noise-driven regression rather than true change in $\\theta_i$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n- E. The listed strategies are appropriate: hierarchical modeling provides shrinkage via $w$; uncertainty intervals communicate variability; multi-year rolling averages reduce $\\sigma^2$ by a factor of $1/k$, mitigating regression-driven fluctuations in observed ranks.
