Let the target event be future transition to a first episode of psychosis within a fixed horizon, and let the binary screening test outcome be positive or negative. Assume the following quantities are known from prior validation studies applied to the same referral population: the pretest probability (prevalence) of transition is $0.20$, the test sensitivity is $0.70$, and the test specificity is $0.80$. Starting only from the definitions of sensitivity, specificity, pretest probability, and Bayes’ theorem relating pretest and post-test probabilities, derive an expression for the positive predictive value in terms of the sensitivity, specificity, and pretest probability, and then evaluate it for the given values.

After computing the value, provide a brief qualitative interpretation (in words) regarding the clinical utility of a positive screen in this setting, considering that early interventions may carry nontrivial monitoring requirements and potential adverse effects. The final numerical answer must be a single exact fraction with no units.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard probability theory and medical statistics, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation.\n\nLet $C$ be the event that a youth in the screened population transitions to a first episode of psychosis (the condition is present).\nLet $C^c$ be the complementary event that the youth does not transition.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the screening test result is positive.\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the screening test result is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following quantities:\n1.  The pretest probability, or prevalence of the condition: $P(C) = 0.20$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive test given the condition is present: $P(T^+|C) = 0.70$.\n3.  The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test given the condition is absent: $P(T^-|C^c) = 0.80$.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the positive predictive value (PPV) and evaluate it. The PPV is defined as the probability that the condition is present given a positive test result, which is denoted by $P(C|T^+)$.\n\nThe derivation begins with Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nP(C|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|C) P(C)}{P(T^+)}\n$$\nThe numerator consists of the sensitivity, $P(T^+|C)$, and the prevalence, $P(C)$, both of which are given.\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test result. We can expand this term using the law of total probability, conditioning on the presence or absence of the condition $C$:\n$$\nP(T^+) = P(T^+|C) P(C) + P(T^+|C^c) P(C^c)\n$$\nWe need to express the terms on the right-hand side using the given quantities.\n- $P(T^+|C)$ is the sensitivity.\n- $P(C)$ is the prevalence.\n- $P(C^c)$ is the probability of not having the condition, which is $1 - P(C)$.\n- $P(T^+|C^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given that the condition is absent (the false positive rate). This can be derived from the specificity. Since the test result can only be positive ($T^+$) or negative ($T^-$), we have $P(T^+|C^c) + P(T^-|C^c) = 1$. Therefore, $P(T^+|C^c) = 1 - P(T^-|C^c)$. The term $P(T^-|C^c)$ is the specificity.\n\nSubstituting these into the expansion for $P(T^+)$ gives:\n$$\nP(T^+) = (\\text{Sensitivity}) \\times (\\text{Prevalence}) + (1 - \\text{Specificity}) \\times (1 - \\text{Prevalence})\n$$\nNow, we substitute this complete expression for $P(T^+)$ back into Bayes' theorem to obtain the general formula for the PPV in terms of the given quantities:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = P(C|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|C) P(C)}{P(T^+|C) P(C) + (1 - P(T^-|C^c)) (1 - P(C))}\n$$\nThis is the required derived expression for the positive predictive value.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the given values. To obtain an exact fraction, we first convert the decimal probabilities to fractions:\n- Prevalence: $P(C) = 0.20 = \\frac{20}{100} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n- Sensitivity: $P(T^+|C) = 0.70 = \\frac{70}{100} = \\frac{7}{10}$.\n- Specificity: $P(T^-|C^c) = 0.80 = \\frac{80}{100} = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nFrom these, we calculate the other necessary terms:\n- $1 - P(C) = 1 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n- $1 - P(T^-|C^c) = 1 - \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nNow, we substitute these fractional values into the PPV formula:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{7}{10}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{7}{10}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)}\n$$\nCalculate the products in the numerator and denominator:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{50}}{\\frac{7}{50} + \\frac{4}{25}}\n$$\nTo add the fractions in the denominator, we find a common denominator, which is $50$:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{50}}{\\frac{7}{50} + \\frac{4 \\times 2}{25 \\times 2}} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{50}}{\\frac{7}{50} + \\frac{8}{50}} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{50}}{\\frac{15}{50}}\n$$\nSimplifying the compound fraction yields the final result:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{7}{15}\n$$\n\nFinally, for the qualitative interpretation:\nThe pretest probability of transitioning to psychosis was $20\\%$ ($\\frac{1}{5}$). After a positive screening test, the post-test probability, or PPV, is $\\frac{7}{15}$, which is approximately $46.7\\%$. This indicates that the test more than doubles the probability of identifying an individual who will truly transition, representing a clinically meaningful enrichment of risk.\nHowever, the result also implies that a majority of individuals who screen positive, $1 - \\frac{7}{15} = \\frac{8}{15}$ (approximately $53.3\\%$), will not transition to psychosis (i.e., they are false positives). Given that early interventions can involve significant burdens, such as side effects from medication and intensive monitoring, applying such interventions to all individuals with a positive screen would mean that more people are treated unnecessarily than are treated appropriately. Therefore, the clinical utility of this test is not as a definitive diagnostic tool for initiating burdensome interventions. Instead, its value lies in risk stratification: it effectively identifies a subgroup for whom intensified monitoring and further, more specific, assessments are warranted, while lower-risk individuals can be managed less intensively. A positive result should be considered an indication for a more detailed clinical evaluation, not an automatic trigger for a high-risk intervention.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{7}{15}}\n$$", "id": "4708907"}, {"introduction": "After identifying a target population, the next critical step is to measure the effectiveness of the intervention. This practice introduces the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), a powerful and intuitive metric for quantifying the impact of an Early Intervention Service (EIS) from clinical trial data.

Treat the provided risks as exact probabilities. Report the NNT as a single number. Then, based on your derivation, briefly interpret how this NNT informs resource allocation decisions in a publicly funded psychiatric service prioritizing relapse prevention, focusing on the expected number of patients who must receive EIS to avert one relapse.

The concepts of risk, randomized controlled trials, and the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) are standard measures for evaluating the efficacy of clinical interventions. The provided risk values are plausible for relapse rates in psychotic disorders over a $12$-month period. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data and definitions provided to derive the NNT from first principles. There are no scientific or factual unsoundness, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe objective is to derive the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) from first principles, based on the provided definitions and data.\n\nLet $R_{UC}$ denote the risk of relapse in the usual care (control) group and $R_{EIS}$ denote the risk of relapse in the Early Intervention Services (intervention) group. The problem states that these risks are to be treated as exact probabilities over a $12$-month period.\nFrom the givens:\n- $R_{UC} = P(\\text{relapse | usual care}) = 0.35$\n- $R_{EIS} = P(\\text{relapse | EIS}) = 0.25$\n\nThe effect of the intervention is quantified by the change in risk. This change is formally known as the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR). The ARR represents the difference in the probability of the adverse outcome (relapse) between the control and intervention groups. A positive ARR indicates that the intervention reduces the risk of the outcome.\n$$\nARR = R_{UC} - R_{EIS}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nARR = 0.35 - 0.25 = 0.10\n$$\nThe ARR of $0.10$ signifies that for any given patient, switching from usual care to EIS reduces their individual probability of relapse by $0.10$. In a population context, it means that for every $100$ patients treated with EIS instead of usual care, we would expect to prevent $100 \\times ARR = 100 \\times 0.10 = 10$ relapses.\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is defined as the expected number of patients who need to receive the experimental intervention (EIS) instead of the standard intervention (usual care) for one additional patient to benefit (i.e., to prevent one relapse). The NNT is the mathematical reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction. If $ARR$ represents the number of adverse outcomes prevented per person treated, then its reciprocal, $1/ARR$, represents the number of persons treated to prevent one adverse outcome.\nTherefore, the formula for NNT is:\n$$\nNNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}\n$$\nUsing the calculated ARR:\n$$\nNNT = \\frac{1}{0.10} = 10\n$$\nThe NNT to prevent one relapse within $12$ months is exactly $10$.\n\n**Interpretation for Resource Allocation**\nAn NNT of $10$ provides a clear, quantitative measure for decision-making in a publicly funded psychiatric service. It means that, on average, the service must treat $10$ patients with the more intensive and likely more expensive Early Intervention Services (EIS) for a period of $12$ months to avert one relapse that would have occurred under usual care. This figure is crucial for resource allocation. For example, if the service has a budget to provide EIS to $50$ new patients, they can project that this investment will prevent approximately $50/10 = 5$ relapses over the next year, compared to providing usual care. This allows planners to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis by comparing the cost of treating $10$ patients with EIS against the medical, social, and economic costs associated with a single psychotic relapse. The NNT thus directly informs the a priori estimation of the clinical impact and efficiency of resource deployment.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{10}\n$$", "id": "4708917"}, {"introduction": "While clinical effectiveness is paramount, the long-term viability of any health program depends on its economic sustainability. This final exercise shifts focus from individual patient outcomes to system-level resource allocation by introducing cost-effectiveness analysis.

All necessary data are provided, and the terminology is standard and unambiguous. There are no contradictions or factual errors. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and a determination of cost-effectiveness based on a given willingness-to-pay threshold.\n\nFirst, let us define the fundamental quantities involved in cost-effectiveness analysis. Let the two alternatives being compared be an intervention (in this case, the early intervention in psychosis service) and a comparator (usual care). We denote the cost of the intervention as $C_{int}$ and the cost of the comparator as $C_{comp}$. Similarly, we denote the effectiveness, measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), of the intervention as $E_{int}$ and that of the comparator as $E_{comp}$.\n\nThe incremental cost, denoted as $\\Delta C$, is defined as the additional cost of the intervention relative to the comparator.\n$$ \\Delta C = C_{int} - C_{comp} $$\nThe problem provides this value directly as an incremental cost of $\\$2000$. Thus, $\\Delta C = \\$2000$.\n\nThe incremental effectiveness, denoted as $\\Delta E$, is defined as the additional health benefit of the intervention relative to the comparator.\n$$ \\Delta E = E_{int} - E_{comp} $$\nThe problem provides this value directly as an incremental health benefit of $0.08$ QALYs. Thus, $\\Delta E = 0.08$ QALYs.\n\nAs requested, we derive the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from these fundamental definitions. The ICER represents the additional cost per unit of additional health benefit gained by choosing the intervention over the comparator. It is defined as the ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental effectiveness.\n$$ \\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} $$\nThis ratio quantifies the 'price' of one additional QALY when switching from the comparator to the intervention.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the ICER for the early intervention program using the given values.\n$$ \\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\$2000}{0.08 \\text{ QALYs}} $$\nTo perform the calculation:\n$$ \\text{ICER} = \\frac{2000}{0.08} \\frac{\\$}{\\text{QALY}} = \\frac{2000}{\\frac{8}{100}} \\frac{\\$}{\\text{QALY}} = 2000 \\times \\frac{100}{8} \\frac{\\$}{\\text{QALY}} = \\frac{200000}{8} \\frac{\\$}{\\text{QALY}} = 25000 \\frac{\\$}{\\text{QALY}} $$\nThe incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the program is $\\$25000$ per QALY.\n\nNext, we must determine if the program is cost-effective. This decision is made by comparing the calculated ICER to the decision-maker's willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold, which we denote as $\\lambda$. The WTP threshold represents the maximum amount of money the health system is willing to pay to gain one additional QALY. The problem states this threshold is $\\lambda = \\$50000$ per QALY.\n\nThe decision rule is as follows:\n- If $\\text{ICER} \\le \\lambda$, the intervention is considered cost-effective. The health benefit it provides is worth its additional cost.\n- If $\\text{ICER}  \\lambda$, the intervention is not considered cost-effective. The additional cost is deemed too high for the health benefit gained.\n\nIn this case, we compare the calculated ICER to the given WTP threshold:\n$$ \\text{ICER} = \\$25000/\\text{QALY} $$\n$$ \\lambda = \\$50000/\\text{QALY} $$\nSince $\\$25000$ is less than $\\$50000$, the condition $\\text{ICER} \\le \\lambda$ is satisfied. Therefore, based on the provided WTP threshold, the early intervention in psychosis service is considered a cost-effective use of resources compared to usual care.\n\nThe final answer requested is the numerical value of the ratio in dollars per QALY.
