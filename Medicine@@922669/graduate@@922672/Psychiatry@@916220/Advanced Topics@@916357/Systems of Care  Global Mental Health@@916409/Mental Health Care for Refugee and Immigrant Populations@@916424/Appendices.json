Validation studies conducted in a similar population show a sensitivity of $0.85$ and a specificity of $0.80$. In the clinic’s current cohort, structured diagnostic interviews estimate the true prevalence of PTSD to be $0.25$. Using Bayes’ theorem and the core definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence framed as conditional probabilities, derive the positive predictive value (PPV) of a positive screen in this cohort from first principles. Then, briefly interpret what this PPV means for clinical decision-making in this setting, considering the balance of false positives and the need for confirmatory assessment.

It provides all necessary information to derive the positive predictive value (PPV) using established principles of biostatistics and probability theory.\n\nTo derive the positive predictive value (PPV) from first principles, we must first define the events and translate the given information into the language of conditional probability.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual has Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).\nLet $D^c$ be the event that an individual does not have PTSD.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the screening tool returns a positive result.\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the screening tool returns a negative result.\n\nThe givens can be expressed as probabilities:\n1.  **Prevalence**: The prevalence of PTSD is the prior probability of the disease in the population, $P(D)$.\n    $$ P(D) = 0.25 $$\n    From this, the probability of not having the disease is:\n    $$ P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 $$\n\n2.  **Sensitivity**: The sensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual has the disease. It is the true positive rate.\n    $$ P(T^+ | D) = 0.85 $$\n\n3.  **Specificity**: The specificity is the probability of a negative test result given that the individual does not have the disease. It is the true negative rate.\n    $$ P(T^- | D^c) = 0.80 $$\n    From this, we can derive the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual does not have the disease:\n    $$ P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 $$\n\nThe objective is to find the positive predictive value (PPV), which is defined as the probability that an individual has the disease given that they have a positive test result. This is the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nWe use Bayes' theorem to find this value:\n$$ PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, which marginalizes over the disease status:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c) $$\n\nThis equation states that the total probability of a positive test is the sum of the probabilities of two mutually exclusive events:\n1.  A true positive: The person has the disease AND tests positive, with probability $P(T^+ \\cap D) = P(T^+|D)P(D)$.\n2.  A false positive: The person does not have the disease AND tests positive, with probability $P(T^+ \\cap D^c) = P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$.\n\nNow, we substitute the known values into these expressions.\nThe probability of a true positive is:\n$$ P(T^+|D)P(D) = 0.85 \\times 0.25 = 0.2125 $$\nThe probability of a false positive is:\n$$ P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c) = 0.20 \\times 0.75 = 0.1500 $$\n\nThe total probability of a positive test is the sum of these two probabilities:\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.2125 + 0.1500 = 0.3625 $$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the PPV by substituting the probability of a true positive and the total probability of a positive test into Bayes' theorem:\n$$ PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{0.2125}{0.3625} $$\n\nTo simplify the fraction:\n$$ \\frac{0.2125}{0.3625} = \\frac{2125}{3625} = \\frac{17}{29} $$\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$$ \\frac{17}{29} \\approx 0.586206896... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ PPV \\approx 0.5862 $$\n\n**Interpretation for Clinical Decision-Making:**\nA positive predictive value of $0.5862$ signifies that for any individual in this cohort who screens positive, there is a $58.62\\%$ probability that they truly have PTSD. Conversely, there is a $1 - 0.5862 = 0.4138$, or $41.38\\%$, chance that the positive result is a false positive. While the screening tool successfully increases the likelihood of identifying an individual with PTSD from the baseline prevalence of $25\\%$ to approximately $59\\%$, the substantial false positive rate indicates that a positive screen cannot be used as a definitive diagnosis. Its clinical utility lies in identifying a high-risk subgroup that requires further, more comprehensive assessment. Therefore, a positive screen should be a trigger for a confirmatory evaluation, such as a structured diagnostic interview by a qualified clinician, before any treatment decisions are made. This two-stage approach balances the need for broad screening (achieved with high sensitivity) against the costs and potential harms of misdiagnosis (mitigated by requiring confirmatory testing).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5862}\n$$", "id": "4727357"}, {"introduction": "Individuals who have experienced profound trauma, such as torture and forced displacement, often present with a complex constellation of symptoms that defies simple categorization.

Through a trained interpreter, he reports that he was detained and tortured 18 months ago. Since the detention, he has had recurring nightmares of the events on most nights of the week (approximately 3–4 nights), intrusive daytime images, and episodes in which he suddenly feels as if the world is unreal and his hands are not his own, particularly when he hears loud bangs or sees police uniforms. These episodes last 5–10 minutes and resolve if he sits, breathes slowly, and orients to the present. He avoids reminders of the detention, startles easily, scans rooms for exits, and sleeps poorly. He describes low mood, diminished interest, guilt, and reduced appetite over the past 2 months, with passive thoughts that life is not worth living but no active plan or intent. When falling asleep, he sometimes hears a male voice saying in the second person that he is “weak and worthless,” which he links to memories of interrogation; these experiences occur predominantly at sleep onset after a day with multiple triggers. He denies thought broadcasting, thought insertion, or ideas of reference. His speech is organized, with intact grooming and goal-directed thought. He chewed khat daily before migration but stopped 2 weeks ago. Since resettling, he drinks approximately 6 standard alcoholic drinks nightly to initiate sleep; 2 days after abstaining for one night, he experienced tremulousness that resolved after drinking the next night.

Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features as the leading diagnosis; Posttraumatic Stress Disorder is less likely because dissociative symptoms are atypical; alcohol use is self-medication and diagnostically irrelevant.\n\nD. Substance/medication-induced anxiety and psychotic disorder due to recent khat cessation and nightly alcohol use as the leading diagnosis; Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ruled out because symptoms should not persist beyond 1 month after the trauma.\n\nE. Focal impaired-awareness seizures presenting as dissociation with secondary anxiety and nightmares as the leading diagnosis; psychiatric diagnoses are premature without neurologic workup.", "solution": "The task is to construct a differential from first principles by applying core definitions and well-tested clinical facts.\n\nFoundational definitions and facts:\n- Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) per DSM-5: Requires exposure to a traumatic event and the presence of intrusion symptoms (cluster B), avoidance (cluster C), negative alterations in cognition and mood (cluster D), and alterations in arousal and reactivity (cluster E), with duration greater than 1 month, clinically significant distress or impairment, and not attributable to a substance or another medical condition. A dissociative subtype is specified when there is prominent depersonalization and/or derealization. Psychotic-like phenomena can occur in PTSD, often tied to trauma cues, with generally preserved reality testing outside of triggers.\n- Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) per DSM-5: At least 5 of 9 symptoms (including depressed mood or anhedonia) for at least 2 weeks causing distress/impairment, not better explained by substances or other conditions. Psychotic features, when present, occur exclusively during mood episodes and are often mood-congruent.\n- Schizophrenia per DSM-5: At least 2 of 5 core symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, negative symptoms) for at least 1 month, with continuous signs of disturbance for at least 6 months, functional decline, and not attributable to substances or another medical condition. Hallucinations are typically not tightly tied to specific external trauma cues and are accompanied by thought disorganization or negative symptoms.\n- Substance/medication-induced disorders per DSM-5: Symptoms arise during or soon after intoxication or withdrawal, the substance is capable of producing the symptoms, and the disturbance is not better explained by an independent disorder whose onset precedes substance use or persists substantially beyond typical substance effects. Stimulants (including cathinones in khat) can cause anxiety, hyperarousal, and psychosis during intoxication; alcohol withdrawal can produce hyperarousal and vivid dreams/nightmares early in abstinence. Hypnagogic phenomena at sleep onset can mimic hallucinations.\n- Dissociation versus primary psychosis: Dissociation (depersonalization/derealization) involves altered integration of consciousness and perception, often triggered by reminders, with preserved meta-awareness and reality testing between episodes. Primary psychosis typically exhibits persistent reality distortion independent of triggers, with additional formal thought disorder or negative symptoms.\n\nApply to the vignette:\n- The patient has clear Criterion A trauma (torture). Intrusions: recurrent nightmares (3–4 nights/week), intrusive images, and flashbacks. Avoidance: of reminders of detention. Negative cognitions/mood: guilt, estrangement, low mood. Arousal: hypervigilance, exaggerated startle, sleep disturbance. Duration is well beyond 1 month (onset after detention 18 months ago). Dissociative episodes with derealization/depersonalization triggered by salient cues are described, with intact orientation and resolution via grounding, consistent with PTSD dissociative subtype.\n- The sleep-onset second-person voice with trauma-congruent content, occurring predominantly after a day of multiple triggers and at hypnagogic transitions, is consistent with trauma-related intrusions or hypnagogic phenomena rather than a primary psychotic process. Reality testing is preserved outside of triggers; there is no disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, or enduring negative symptoms.\n- MDD features (low mood, anhedonia, appetite changes, passive death thoughts) for 2 months suggest comorbid MDD meeting duration criteria; however, the trauma-related symptom clusters predate and cannot be explained by MDD alone. If psychotic features were purely mood-congruent and restricted to mood episodes, one might suspect MDD with psychotic features; here, the phenomena are temporally and thematically linked to trauma cues and sleep onset rather than exclusively to mood episodes.\n- Substance contributions: Khat cessation 2 weeks ago could have previously contributed to hyperarousal or psychotic symptoms during intoxication, but the long-standing symptoms since detention and persistence beyond cessation argue against a primary substance-induced disorder. Alcohol use is heavy and can worsen sleep, produce withdrawal tremor (as seen 2 days after a brief abstinence), and contribute to vivid dreams or anxiety during early abstinence, but it does not parsimoniously account for 18 months of reexperiencing, avoidance, and dissociation. A negative urine drug screen does not test for khat reliably, but the temporal course still favors PTSD as primary, with substances as potential modifiers rather than the root cause.\n- Neurologic causes like focal impaired-awareness seizures typically feature stereotyped episodes with impaired awareness, automatisms, and postictal changes; while dissociation can superficially resemble these, the clear linkage to psychological triggers, preserved ability to ground, and the broader syndrome of reexperiencing and avoidance make a primary seizure disorder an unlikely unifying diagnosis. Neurologic evaluation can be considered if atypical features emerge, but it is not the leading formulation.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- A. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder with dissociative subtype as the leading diagnosis; assess for comorbid Major Depressive Disorder; consider contribution of alcohol-related sleep disturbance or withdrawal; primary psychotic disorder unlikely given phenomenology and course.\n  Analysis: This aligns with DSM-5 criteria for PTSD including dissociative features, recognizes MDD comorbidity given 2 months of depressive symptoms, and appropriately frames alcohol as a contributory factor without overattributing. It correctly deprioritizes a primary psychotic disorder given the trauma-linked, hypnagogic nature of voices, intact thought process, and absence of negative/disorganized symptoms. Verdict: Correct.\n\n- B. Primary Schizophrenia as the leading diagnosis explaining nightmares, hyperarousal, and dissociation; Posttraumatic Stress Disorder unlikely because the hallucinations indicate loss of reality testing; substance effects not contributory given a negative urine drug screen.\n  Analysis: Misinterprets phenomenology; trauma-linked, hypnagogic voices with preserved reality testing outside triggers do not establish primary psychosis. Schizophrenia would require additional hallmark features and a course independent of trauma cues. The urine drug screen’s negativity does not exclude all substances and is irrelevant to the PTSD evidence. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- C. Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features as the leading diagnosis; Posttraumatic Stress Disorder is less likely because dissociative symptoms are atypical; alcohol use is self-medication and diagnostically irrelevant.\n  Analysis: MDD psychotic features should be confined to mood episodes and are often mood-congruent; here, trauma-related intrusions and dissociative symptoms preceded the depressive episode. Dissociation is not atypical for PTSD; it is part of a specified subtype. Minimizing alcohol’s diagnostic contribution is inaccurate given withdrawal and sleep effects. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- D. Substance/medication-induced anxiety and psychotic disorder due to recent khat cessation and nightly alcohol use as the leading diagnosis; Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ruled out because symptoms should not persist beyond 1 month after the trauma.\n  Analysis: The assertion about PTSD duration is factually wrong; DSM-5 requires duration greater than 1 month, and symptoms can persist chronically. The course beginning after torture and persisting 18 months argues against a primary substance-induced syndrome. Substances may exacerbate but do not fully account for the syndrome. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- E. Focal impaired-awareness seizures presenting as dissociation with secondary anxiety and nightmares as the leading diagnosis; psychiatric diagnoses are premature without neurologic workup.\n  Analysis: The episodes are psychologically triggered, with intact meta-awareness and responsive to grounding, and occur within a full PTSD symptom constellation. While neurologic causes can be considered if indicated, they do not provide the most parsimonious unifying explanation here. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate differential formulation prioritizes Posttraumatic Stress Disorder with dissociative subtype, with assessment for comorbid Major Depressive Disorder and attention to alcohol-related contributions, while de-emphasizing primary psychotic and primary substance-induced disorders as leading explanations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4727338"}, {"introduction": "An accurate diagnosis is the starting point, not the end point, of effective mental health care.

Starting from the following foundational bases in psychiatry and psychotherapy, determine the most appropriate adaptation strategy that integrates caregiver involvement and culturally congruent trauma processing while maintaining fidelity to TF-CBT mechanisms of action:\n\n- Attachment theory: secure attachment behaviors are facilitated by consistent, attuned caregiver responses; disrupted attachment in middle childhood and early adolescence can be ameliorated by structured caregiver involvement that builds accurate attributions, sensitive co-regulation, and predictable routines.\n- Cognitive behavioral theory: symptoms of posttraumatic stress are maintained by maladaptive appraisals and avoidance; graded exposure and cognitive processing reduce fear and correct distorted beliefs when conducted with adequate affect regulation and safety.\n- Developmental psychopathology: at 12 years, concrete-to-formal operational thinking allows for structured skill-building, collaborative meaning-making, and caregiver-assisted generalization across contexts.\n- Cultural psychiatry: culturally grounded explanations of illness and idioms of distress shape help-seeking and coping; culturally responsive care uses interpreters or cultural brokers, elicits narratives in familiar metaphors, and respects values and rituals without reinforcing harmful avoidance.\n\nWhich plan best operationalizes these bases into a TF-CBT adaptation for this patient?\n\nA. Begin with intensive individual recounting of the most horrific events in graphic detail to achieve rapid fear extinction; defer caregiver involvement until after the child completes the trauma narrative; avoid interpreter use to preserve confidentiality, and prohibit cultural metaphors to maintain “clinical neutrality.”\n\nB. Establish parallel caregiver sessions to build parenting skills for co-regulation and accurate attributions; co-construct a culturally anchored trauma narrative using the child’s metaphors and migration story; use a trained interpreter or cultural broker to ensure fidelity and trust; include conjoint sessions for joint processing of maladaptive beliefs (e.g., guilt, self-blame), titrate in vivo mastery plans that respect religious practices and community safety, and incorporate future safety planning that addresses acculturation stressors and upcoming immigration procedures.\n\nC. Emphasize psychodynamic exploration of early attachment representations without trauma processing; limit caregiver participation to logistics to avoid “countertransference contamination”; discourage cultural idioms of distress to prevent reinforcement of “folk beliefs,” and prioritize insight over skill acquisition.\n\nD. Implement group-based narrative exposure with peers from the same community to leverage shared experience; minimize individual caregiver involvement to reduce enmeshment; focus on repetitive recounting of the worst event until habituation occurs, with homework centered on recounting details without affect modulation or cognitive processing elements.\n\nE.

The validity of the problem statement must be assessed first.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n- **Patient:** A 12-year-old refugee from a war-affected region.\n- **Presenting Symptoms:** Recurrent nightmares, hypervigilance, school refusal, irritability, occasional dissociative episodes.\n- **History:** Separation from parents, disrupted attachment (manifesting as clinginess and rejection), expresses distress through cultural idioms (\"a heavy heart,\" \"evil eye\"), limited proficiency in the local language.\n- **Caregiver:** Lives with an aunt who is willing to participate in treatment but is anxious about discussing trauma.\n- **Current Context:** No imminent threat or abuse. Ongoing stressors include acculturation, immigration concerns, and mental health stigma.\n- **Proposed Treatment:** Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT).\n- **Guiding Principles (Axioms):**\n    1.  **Attachment theory:** Amelioration of disrupted attachment requires structured caregiver involvement to build accurate attributions, co-regulation, and routines.\n    2.  **Cognitive behavioral theory (CBT):** Post-traumatic stress symptoms are maintained by maladaptive appraisals and avoidance. Treatment involves graded exposure and cognitive processing with adequate affect regulation and safety.\n    3.  **Developmental psychopathology:** At age 12, the patient's cognitive stage (concrete-to-formal operational) is suitable for structured skill-building, collaborative meaning-making, and caregiver-assisted generalization.\n    4.  **Cultural psychiatry:** Culturally responsive care should use interpreters/brokers, engage with cultural metaphors and idioms of distress, and respect patient values, without reinforcing harmful avoidance.\n- **Objective:** Identify the adaptation strategy for TF-CBT that best integrates these principles for the given case.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n- **Scientific Groundedness:** The problem is firmly located within the field of clinical psychiatry and psychotherapy. The concepts presented—TF-CBT, attachment theory, CBT, developmental psychopathology, and cultural psychiatry—are well-established, evidence-based frameworks. The patient vignette is a classic and realistic presentation of complex trauma in a refugee child. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a specific clinical case, a set of governing principles (axioms), and asks for a deductive conclusion about which of several options best applies these principles. It is structured to have a single best answer derived from the provided information.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, clinical language. The patient's history, symptoms, and context are described factually. The foundational bases are presented as given principles for the purpose of solving the problem. There is no subjective or biased language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically grounded within its domain, and well-posed.

The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to evaluate each proposed plan (A, B, C, D, E) against the four foundational bases as applied to the specific case of the 12-year-old refugee child. A valid plan must integrate caregiver involvement, culturally congruent trauma processing, developmental appropriateness, and the core mechanisms of TF-CBT (graded exposure and cognitive processing).\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis plan proposes intensive, detailed trauma recounting from the outset, deferral of caregiver involvement, avoidance of interpreters, and prohibition of cultural metaphors.\n- **vs. CBT:** \"Intensive...recounting...in graphic detail\" at the beginning violates the principle of \"graded exposure\" and providing \"adequate affect regulation.\" This approach risks re-traumatization.\n- **vs. Attachment Theory:** \"Defer caregiver involvement\" directly contradicts the principle that \"disrupted attachment...can be ameliorated by structured caregiver involvement.\"\n- **vs. Cultural Psychiatry:** \"Avoid interpreter use\" and \"prohibit cultural metaphors\" are in direct opposition to the principles of using interpreters for fidelity and trust and eliciting narratives in \"familiar metaphors.\"\nThis option is antithetical to nearly all the provided bases.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThis plan proposes parallel caregiver sessions, co-construction of a culturally anchored narrative using the child's metaphors, use of an interpreter, conjoint sessions for processing beliefs, and safety planning that addresses current stressors.\n- **vs. Attachment Theory:** \"Parallel caregiver sessions to build parenting skills for co-regulation and accurate attributions\" and \"conjoint sessions\" directly implement the principle of \"structured caregiver involvement\" to address disrupted attachment.\n- **vs. CBT:** \"Co-construct a...trauma narrative,\" \"joint processing of maladaptive beliefs,\" and \"titrate in vivo mastery plans\" are all core components of TF-CBT that align perfectly with the principles of graded exposure and cognitive processing.\n- **vs. Developmental Psychopathology:** The collaborative nature (\"co-construct\") and inclusion of the caregiver for joint processing and planning align with the capabilities of a 12-year-old for \"collaborative meaning-making\" and \"caregiver-assisted generalization.\"\n- **vs. Cultural Psychiatry:** \"Culturally anchored...narrative using the child's metaphors,\" \"use a trained interpreter,\" and respecting practices (\"respect religious practices\") are direct applications of the cultural responsiveness principle.\nThis option systematically integrates all four foundational bases into a coherent, sensitive, and theoretically sound treatment plan.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis plan suggests a psychodynamic approach, limits caregiver involvement, discourages cultural idioms, and prioritizes insight over skills.\n- **vs. Problem Statement:** This plan is explicitly psychodynamic (\"exploration of early attachment representations\") and avoids trauma processing, which contradicts the specified intervention of TF-CBT.\n- **vs. CBT:** The plan \"emphasize...without trauma processing\" and \"prioritize insight over skill acquisition\" is inconsistent with the action- and skills-oriented approach of CBT.\n- **vs. Attachment Theory:** It proposes to \"limit caregiver participation,\" which is contrary to the recommendations for ameliorating disrupted attachment.\n- **vs. Cultural Psychiatry:** It \"discourage[s] cultural idioms of distress,\" which is the opposite of culturally responsive care.\nThis option proposes an entirely different and inappropriate treatment modality.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis plan proposes group-based narrative exposure, minimal caregiver involvement, and repetitive recounting without cognitive or affective components.\n- **vs. Attachment Theory:** \"Minimize individual caregiver involvement\" is contraindicated given the child's history of \"disrupted attachment.\"\n- **vs. CBT:** Focusing on \"recounting details without affect modulation or cognitive processing elements\" is a misapplication of exposure therapy. TF-CBT requires these components to be effective and safe, as stated in the CBT principle (\"adequate affect regulation and safety,\" \"cognitive processing\").\n- **vs. Problem Statement:** While group therapy can be effective, TF-CBT is prototypically an individual and family therapy. Shifting to a group model while minimizing family work is a significant deviation that is not justified by the case presentation.\nThis plan misinterprets the mechanisms of TF-CBT and fails to address the central attachment issues.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option E:**\nThis plan suggests redirecting treatment away from trauma and toward future-oriented goals, omitting the trauma narrative, and restricting sessions to the child.\n- **vs. CBT:** To \"omit the trauma narrative\" is to engage in the very avoidance that CBT identifies as a maintaining factor for post-traumatic stress. This fundamentally violates the premise of TF-CBT.\n- **vs. Attachment Theory:** To \"restrict sessions to the child to promote autonomy\" ignores the critical need to repair the \"disrupted attachment\" through dyadic work with the caregiver.\n- **vs. Problem Statement:** This plan is not an adaptation of TF-CBT; it is an abandonment of its core components.\nThis option represents an avoidance-based strategy that fails to treat the core trauma pathology and neglects the relational context.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B is the only strategy that correctly and comprehensively operationalizes all four of the stated foundational principles. It proposes a plan that is consistent with the model of TF-CBT, developmentally appropriate, culturally sensitive, and directly addresses the attachment disruptions central to the case.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4727367"}]}
