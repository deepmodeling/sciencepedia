[@problem_id:4690489]", "problem": "An Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) team is planning service capacity for a shared caseload of $100$ adult clients with serious mental illness. ACT emphasizes high-frequency, team-based, community outreach with shared caseloads and daily coordination. In contrast to Intensive Case Management (ICM), ACT service intensity is governed both by a normative client-to-staff ratio and by the contact-time demand implied by service frequency and duration. The team must meet both constraints simultaneously.\n\nUse the following foundational definitions and planning assumptions grounded in standard service-capacity concepts:\n- A Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) is defined as one staff member working $40$ hours per week.\n- For ACT, assume that a fraction $0.70$ of each staff member’s weekly hours is available for contact-related activities, inclusive of face-to-face time, travel, and documentation; the remaining $0.30$ is allocated to supervision, team meetings, outreach planning, and other non-contact tasks intrinsic to ACT fidelity.\n- The program targets an average of $3$ contacts per client per week.\n- Each contact involves $45$ minutes of face-to-face time and an additional $15$ minutes of travel plus documentation, for a total of $60$ minutes per contact counted toward contact-related activities.\n- The program is required to adhere to a normative ACT client-to-staff ratio of $10:1$.\n\nStarting from these definitions, derive the minimal total clinical staff FTE required to satisfy both the ratio constraint and the contact-time demand. Report the single minimal FTE value that simultaneously meets both constraints. Round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimal total clinical staff Full-Time Equivalents (FTE) for an Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) team. This minimum FTE must simultaneously satisfy two independent constraints: a normative client-to-staff ratio and the total weekly contact-time demand generated by the client caseload. We will calculate the FTE required to meet each constraint separately and then determine the overall minimum required FTE.\n\nLet $N_c$ be the total number of clients, given as $N_c = 100$.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the constraint imposed by the client-to-staff ratio.\nThe problem states a required normative ratio of $10:1$, meaning $10$ clients per staff member.\nLet $FTE_{ratio}$ be the number of FTEs required to satisfy this ratio. This is calculated by dividing the total number of clients by the number of clients per staff member.\n$$FTE_{ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total Clients}}{\\text{Clients per Staff}} = \\frac{N_c}{10}$$\nSubstituting the given value for $N_c$:\n$$FTE_{ratio} = \\frac{100}{10} = 10$$\nTherefore, to meet the ratio constraint, a minimum of $10$ FTEs are required.\n\nSecond, we analyze the constraint imposed by the contact-time demand. This involves three steps:\n1.  Calculate the total weekly contact time demanded by the entire client population.\n2.  Calculate the available weekly contact time supplied by a single FTE.\n3.  Divide the total demand by the per-FTE supply to find the number of FTEs needed.\n\nLet $D_{total}$ be the total weekly contact-time demand in hours.\nThe target average number of contacts per client per week is $3$.\nThe total time per contact is the sum of face-to-face time ($45$ minutes) and travel/documentation time ($15$ minutes), which is $45 + 15 = 60$ minutes, or $1$ hour.\nThe total weekly demand is the product of the number of clients, the contacts per client per week, and the time per contact.\n$$D_{total} = (\\text{Number of clients}) \\times (\\text{Contacts per client per week}) \\times (\\text{Time per contact})$$\n$$D_{total} = 100 \\text{ clients} \\times \\frac{3 \\text{ contacts}}{\\text{client} \\cdot \\text{week}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ hour}}{\\text{contact}} = 300 \\frac{\\text{hours}}{\\text{week}}$$\n\nNow, let $H_{avail}$ be the available contact-related time per FTE per week.\nAn FTE is defined as $40$ hours per week.\nThe fraction of this time available for contact-related activities is given as $0.70$.\n$$H_{avail} = (\\text{Hours per FTE per week}) \\times (\\text{Fraction for contact activities})$$\n$$H_{avail} = 40 \\frac{\\text{hours}}{\\text{FTE} \\cdot \\text{week}} \\times 0.70 = 28 \\frac{\\text{hours}}{\\text{FTE} \\cdot \\text{week}}$$\n\nLet $FTE_{demand}$ be the number of FTEs required to meet the total contact-time demand. This is found by dividing the total demand by the available time per FTE.\n$$FTE_{demand} = \\frac{D_{total}}{H_{avail}} = \\frac{300 \\frac{\\text{hours}}{\\text{week}}}{28 \\frac{\\text{hours}}{\\text{FTE} \\cdot \\text{week}}} = \\frac{300}{28} \\text{ FTEs}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$FTE_{demand} = \\frac{300}{28} = \\frac{75}{7} \\approx 10.714285...$$\n\nThe team must be large enough to satisfy both constraints. This means the required number of FTEs must be greater than or equal to both $FTE_{ratio}$ and $FTE_{demand}$. The minimal number of FTEs that satisfies this condition is the maximum of the two calculated values.\nLet $FTE_{min}$ be the minimal required FTE.\n$$FTE_{min} = \\max(FTE_{ratio}, FTE_{demand})$$\n$$FTE_{min} = \\max(10, \\frac{300}{28})$$\nSince $\\frac{300}{28} \\approx 10.714 > 10$, the contact-time demand is the more restrictive constraint.\n$$FTE_{min} = \\frac{300}{28} \\approx 10.714285...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $1$, $0$, and $7$. The fourth digit is $1$, so we do not round up the third digit.\n$$FTE_{min} \\approx 10.7$$\n\nThus, a minimum of $10.7$ FTEs are required.
