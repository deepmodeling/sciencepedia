Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) provides a structured and quantifiable method to operationalize this principle, transforming personalized targets into a standardized score. This exercise [@problem_id:4753673] demonstrates how to calculate and interpret a GAS T-score, a core skill for tracking progress in a truly person-centered way.", "problem": "A multidisciplinary community psychiatry team implementing a recovery-oriented care model collaborates with a patient living with schizophrenia to co-create three individualized goals on the Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) framework. In GAS, each goal is rated on a five-point scale centered at the expected level of attainment, with the following numerical anchors: much less than expected attainment ($-2$), less than expected attainment ($-1$), expected attainment ($0$), more than expected attainment ($1$), and much more than expected attainment ($2$). The team assigns relative importance weights to the three goals as $w=[1,2,1]$, and at follow-up the attained ratings are $x=[1,0,-1]$.\n\nStarting from the core definitions that (i) recovery-oriented GAS uses a weighted aggregate of goal ratings and (ii) the standardized score should have mean $50$ when the expected level is met and standard deviation $10$ under independence and equal unit variance of goal ratings, derive the closed-form expression for the GAS $T$-score in terms of $w$ and $x$ by standardizing the weighted sum. Then compute the $T$-score for the given $w$ and $x$. Express your final numerical answer as an exact number. After computing, briefly interpret whether the aggregated recovery is above, below, or at the expected trajectory in this recovery-oriented care plan. The final computed value must be reported as a single real number.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) $T$-score formula and its application to a specific case.\n\nLet the number of goals be $k$. The relative importance weights are denoted by the vector $w = [w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_k]$, and the attained outcome ratings are denoted by the vector $x = [x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k]$. The problem statement provides $k=3$, $w=[1,2,1]$, and $x=[1,0,-1]$. The rating scale for each $x_i$ is centered at $0$, which represents the expected level of attainment.\n\nThe first step is to define the weighted aggregate score. As per the problem's definition (i), this is a weighted sum of the individual goal ratings. Let this score be $S$.\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i x_i$$\nThis can also be expressed as the dot product of the weight and score vectors, $S = w \\cdot x$.\n\nThe next step is to standardize this score. Standardization requires us to determine the mean and standard deviation of $S$ under a set of baseline assumptions. The problem specifies these assumptions: when the expected level of attainment is met for all goals, and the individual goal ratings $x_i$ are treated as independent random variables, each with unit variance.\n\nLet's find the mean (expected value) of $S$, denoted $\\mu_S$, when the expected level of attainment is met. The rating for the expected level is given as $0$. Therefore, the expected value of each individual rating is $E[x_i] = 0$.\nUsing the linearity of the expectation operator:\n$$\\mu_S = E[S] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i x_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i E[x_i]$$\nSubstituting $E[x_i] = 0$:\n$$\\mu_S = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i (0) = 0$$\nThus, the mean of the weighted aggregate score, when performance is at the expected level, is $0$.\n\nNow, let's find the variance of $S$, denoted $\\sigma_S^2$. The problem states that the goal ratings $x_i$ are independent and have equal unit variance, i.e., $\\text{Var}(x_i) = 1$ for all $i$. For independent random variables, the variance of a weighted sum is the weighted sum of the variances, where the weights are squared.\n$$\\sigma_S^2 = \\text{Var}(S) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i x_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\text{Var}(w_i x_i)$$\nSince $w_i$ are constants, $\\text{Var}(w_i x_i) = w_i^2 \\text{Var}(x_i)$.\n$$\\sigma_S^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i^2 \\text{Var}(x_i)$$\nSubstituting the unit variance assumption, $\\text{Var}(x_i) = 1$:\n$$\\sigma_S^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i^2$$\nThe standard deviation of $S$ is the square root of the variance:\n$$\\sigma_S = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i^2}$$\nA standardized score, or $z$-score, is calculated as $z = \\frac{\\text{value} - \\text{mean}}{\\text{standard deviation}}$. For our score $S$, this becomes:\n$$z = \\frac{S - \\mu_S}{\\sigma_S} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i x_i - 0}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i^2}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i x_i}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i^2}}$$\nThe problem requires a $T$-score, which is a linear transformation of the $z$-score to a distribution with a specified mean and standard deviation. The general form is $T = (\\text{target SD}) \\cdot z + (\\text{target mean})$. The problem specifies a target mean of $50$ and a target standard deviation of $10$.\nSubstituting the expression for $z$ and the target parameters, we derive the closed-form expression for the GAS $T$-score:\n$$T = 10 \\left( \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i x_i}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i^2}} \\right) + 50$$\nThis is the formula derived by Kiresuk and Sherman for Goal Attainment Scaling.\n\nNow, we compute the $T$-score for the given patient data:\n$$w = [1, 2, 1]$$\n$$x = [1, 0, -1]$$\nFirst, calculate the weighted sum of the scores, $\\sum w_i x_i$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i x_i = (1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) = 1 + 0 - 1 = 0$$\nNext, calculate the sum of the squared weights, $\\sum w_i^2$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6$$\nNow substitute these values into the derived $T$-score formula:\n$$T = 10 \\left( \\frac{0}{\\sqrt{6}} \\right) + 50$$\n$$T = 10(0) + 50 = 50$$\nThe final computed value for the GAS $T$-score is $50$.\n\nFor the final part of the task, we interpret this result. A $T$-score of $50$ is, by definition, the mean of the standardized distribution. In the context of GAS, this mean corresponds precisely to the aggregated expected level of attainment. Although the patient's performance varied across goals—exceeding expectations on the first goal ($x_1=1$), falling short on the third ($x_3=-1$), and meeting expectations on the most heavily weighted second goal ($x_2=0$)—the weighted aggregate score is zero. This indicates that, when accounting for the relative importance of each goal, the positive and negative deviations from the expected outcomes cancel each other out exactly. Therefore, the overall, aggregated recovery for this patient is precisely at the expected trajectory defined in the recovery-oriented care plan.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{50}$$", "id": "4753673"}, {"introduction": "Beyond individual progress, we must evaluate whether our interventions are effective at a program level, which requires understanding the magnitude of an effect, not just its statistical significance.
