The clinic has adopted a validated panic disorder screener administered at intake as part of routine measurement-based care.

For the chosen screening threshold, the screener has sensitivity $0.80$ and specificity $0.90$. Let $D$ denote the event that the patient truly has panic disorder, and let $T$ denote the event that the screener result is positive. Sensitivity is defined as $P(T \\mid D)$, specificity is defined as $P(\\overline{T} \\mid \\overline{D})$, and prevalence is $P(D)$. Starting from these core definitions and Bayes’ theorem, derive expressions for the positive predictive value $P(D \\mid T)$ and the negative predictive value $P(\\overline{D} \\mid \\overline{T})$, and then compute their numerical values for the given parameters.

This reflects the interplay of base rate $0.10$ and test performance; despite good sensitivity and specificity, with a low base prevalence, nearly half of positive screens may be false positives. This suggests that a positive screen should prompt careful diagnostic confirmation (for example, a structured clinical interview) before initiating treatment, aligning with patient values and preferences regarding the risks of overtreatment.\n- If the screener is negative, the probability the patient does not have panic disorder is approximately $0.9759$, leaving a residual probability of $1 - 0.9759 = 0.0241$ that the patient may still have panic disorder despite a negative screen. In SDM, this small residual risk can be discussed; for example, if the patient experiences severe, functionally impairing symptoms or has high concern about missing treatment, the clinician might recommend additional assessment or interim monitoring using ongoing measurement-based tools, whereas if concerns are low, watchful waiting with scheduled re-assessment may be acceptable.\n\nThe requested final output is the $1 \\times 2$ row vector with the positive predictive value first and the negative predictive value second, each as decimals rounded to four significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}0.4706  0.9759\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4701597"}, {"introduction": "Expanding from the individual patient to the system level, implementing MBC within a Collaborative Care Model requires careful resource planning.
