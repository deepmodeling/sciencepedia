In digital mental health services, the break-even point is reached when cumulative operating revenue equals cumulative operating cost.

The prevalence of the condition, $\\pi$, is the prior probability of an individual having the disease:\n    $$P(D) = \\pi = 0.02$$\n    From this, the probability of an individual not having the disease is:\n    $$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\pi = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98$$\n\n2.  The sensitivity of the classifier, $\\mathrm{Se}$, is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual has the disease (the true positive rate):\n    $$\\mathrm{Se} = P(T|D) = 0.85$$\n\n3.  The specificity of the classifier, $\\mathrm{Sp}$, is the probability of a negative test result given that the individual does not have the disease (the true negative rate):\n    $$\\mathrm{Sp} = P(T^c|D^c) = 0.90$$\n    From this, we can derive the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual does not have the disease:\n    $$P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - \\mathrm{Sp} = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and compute its value. The PPV is defined as the probability that an individual truly has the disease given that they have received a positive test result. In our notation, this is $P(D|T)$.\n\nWe use Bayes' theorem to express $P(D|T)$:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, represents the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. It can be expanded using the law of total probability, summing over the mutually exclusive states of having the disease ($D$) or not having the disease ($D^c$):\n$$P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$$\n\nSubstituting this expansion for $P(T)$ into the expression for Bayes' theorem gives us the full formula for PPV:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)}$$\n\nThis expression can be rewritten using the standard terms for prevalence ($\\pi$), sensitivity ($\\mathrm{Se}$), and specificity ($\\mathrm{Sp}$):\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi}{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp}) \\cdot (1 - \\pi)}$$\nThis is the derived expression for PPV based on the foundational definitions.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the PPV by substituting the given values: $\\pi = 0.02$, $\\mathrm{Se} = 0.85$, and $\\mathrm{Sp} = 0.90$.\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{(0.85) \\cdot (0.02)}{(0.85) \\cdot (0.02) + (1 - 0.90) \\cdot (1 - 0.02)}$$\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{0.017}{0.017 + (0.10) \\cdot (0.98)}$$\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{0.017}{0.017 + 0.098}$$\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{0.017}{0.115}$$\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} \\approx 0.147826...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} \\approx 0.1478$$\n\nFinally, we must articulate the implications of this result for triage design in telepsychiatry.\nThe computed PPV of approximately $0.1478$ means that out of all individuals flagged as high-risk by the classifier, only about $14.8\\%$ are true positives (i.e., actually have a current major depressive episode). Conversely, about $85.2\\%$ of the positive flags are false positives.\n\nThe implications for triage design are significant:\n1.  **Inefficiency of Direct Referral**: Directly referring every individual with a positive screen to a licensed clinician (e.g., a psychiatrist) for a full diagnostic evaluation would be highly inefficient. Given the limited capacity of such specialized professionals, this approach would lead to a system bottleneck where the vast majority of clinician time ($85\\%$) is spent on assessing individuals who are not in the target disease state. This wastes expensive resources and creates long wait times for everyone, including the true positives who are in urgent need of care.\n\n2.  **Necessity of a Multi-Stage Triage System**: The low PPV indicates that the ML classifier is best suited as a first-stage, broad-spectrum screening tool, not a diagnostic one. A positive flag should not trigger a definitive clinical encounter. Instead, it should trigger a second stage of assessment. This second stage should be more specific than the initial screen but less resource-intensive than a full psychiatric evaluation. Examples include administering a more detailed, validated self-report instrument like the PHQ-9, or a brief, structured interview by a trained mental health worker or case manager. This filters the pool of potential patients, creating a smaller, higher-prevalence group for the final, resource-intensive diagnostic stage.\n\n3.  **Quantitative Basis for System Design**: The computed PPV provides a quantitative basis for designing this multi-stage system. It tells us that for every true positive case identified by the classifier, there are approximately $(1 - 0.1478) / 0.1478 \\approx 5.76$ false positives. Thus, the second-stage screening process must be capable of efficiently handling roughly $6$ to $7$ patients to identify one true positive. This number, the reciprocal of the PPV, is critical for capacity planning and resource allocation in the triage workflow. The design must balance the goal of enriching the patient pool for true positives against the risk of introducing delays or patient drop-off between stages, which could compromise the ultimate goal of connecting those in need with timely care.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1478}$$", "id": "4765564"}]}
