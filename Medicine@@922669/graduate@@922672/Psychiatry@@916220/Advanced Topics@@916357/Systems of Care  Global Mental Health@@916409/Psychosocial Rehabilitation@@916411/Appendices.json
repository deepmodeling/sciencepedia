The derivation must proceed from first principles using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) framework.\n\nFirst, we establish the statistical model. The rating $x_{ij}$ for the $i$-th service user (subject) by the $j$-th clinician (rater) is modeled by a two-way random-effects model:\n$$x_{ij} = \\mu + r_i + c_j + e_{ij}$$\nHere, $i=1, \\dots, n$ and $j=1, \\dots, k$, where $n$ is the number of service users and $k$ is the number of clinicians. In this problem, $n=4$ and $k=3$. The components of the model are:\n- $\\mu$: the grand mean of all ratings in the population.\n- $r_i$: the random effect due to service user $i$, assumed to be normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma_r^2$, i.e., $r_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma_r^2)$.\n- $c_j$: the random effect due to clinician $j$, assumed to be normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma_c^2$, i.e., $c_j \\sim N(0, \\sigma_c^2)$.\n- $e_{ij}$: the random error term for the rating on user $i$ by clinician $j$, assumed to be normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma_e^2$, i.e., $e_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma_e^2)$.\nAll random effects are assumed to be independent of each other.\n\nThe variance of a single rating $x_{ij}$ is the sum of the variances of its random components:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(x_{ij}) = \\sigma_r^2 + \\sigma_c^2 + \\sigma_e^2$$\nThe $\\mathrm{ICC}$ for absolute agreement is defined as the proportion of total variance that is attributable to the true-score variance. In this model, the \"true score\" for service user $i$ is constant across clinicians and is represented by $\\mu + r_i$. Its variance is $\\sigma_r^2$. The variance components $\\sigma_c^2$ (systematic differences between clinicians) and $\\sigma_e^2$ (random error) are considered sources of measurement error.\n\nTherefore, the definition of $\\mathrm{ICC}(2,1)$ is:\n$$\\mathrm{ICC}(2,1) = \\frac{\\text{true-score variance}}{\\text{total variance}} = \\frac{\\sigma_r^2}{\\sigma_r^2 + \\sigma_c^2 + \\sigma_e^2}$$\n\nTo estimate this quantity, we must first estimate the variance components $\\sigma_r^2$, $\\sigma_c^2$, and $\\sigma_e^2$. This is achieved using the mean squares from a two-way ANOVA. The expected values of the mean squares for this model are:\n- Mean Square for Rows (between-subjects): $E(MS_r) = \\sigma_e^2 + k\\sigma_r^2$\n- Mean Square for Columns (between-clinicians): $E(MS_c) = \\sigma_e^2 + n\\sigma_c^2$\n- Mean Square for Error (residual): $E(MS_e) = \\sigma_e^2$\n\nBy replacing the expected mean squares with their observed sample values, we can solve for the variance component estimators:\n$$\\hat{\\sigma}_e^2 = MS_e$$\n$$\\hat{\\sigma}_r^2 = \\frac{MS_r - MS_e}{k}$$\n$$\\hat{\\sigma}_c^2 = \\frac{MS_c - MS_e}{n}$$\nSubstituting these estimators into the definition of $\\mathrm{ICC}(2,1)$ yields the formula for its estimator:\n$$\\mathrm{ICC}(2,1) = \\frac{\\frac{MS_r - MS_e}{k}}{\\frac{MS_r - MS_e}{k} + \\frac{MS_c - MS_e}{n} + MS_e}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $k$ gives the commonly used computational formula:\n$$\\mathrm{ICC}(2,1) = \\frac{MS_r - MS_e}{MS_r + (k-1)MS_e + \\frac{k}{n}(MS_c - MS_e)}$$\n\nNow, we compute the necessary sums and mean squares from the provided data:\nThe data matrix is:\n$$ X = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 & 3 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 4 & 3 & 4 \\\\ 2 & 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe have $n=4$ service users and $k=3$ clinicians.\nThe row sums (for each user) are $R_1=8$, $R_2=4$, $R_3=11$, $R_4=7$.\nThe column sums (for each clinician) are $C_1=10$, $C_2=9$, $C_3=11$.\nThe grand sum is $G = \\sum R_i = \\sum C_j = 30$.\nThe total number of observations is $N=nk=12$.\nThe grand mean is $\\bar{x}_{\\cdot\\cdot} = \\frac{G}{N} = \\frac{30}{12} = 2.5$.\n\nThe sums of squares (SS) are calculated as follows:\nThe correction term is $C = \\frac{G^2}{N} = \\frac{30^2}{12} = \\frac{900}{12} = 75$.\nThe total sum of all squared observations is $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^k x_{ij}^2 = 3^2+2^2+3^2 + 1^2+2^2+1^2 + 4^2+3^2+4^2 + 2^2+2^2+3^2 = 86$.\nTotal Sum of Squares: $SS_{tot} = (\\sum x_{ij}^2) - C = 86 - 75 = 11$.\nSum of Squares for Rows (subjects): $SS_r = \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{i=1}^n R_i^2 - C = \\frac{1}{3}(8^2+4^2+11^2+7^2) - 75 = \\frac{1}{3}(64+16+121+49) - 75 = \\frac{250}{3} - 75 = \\frac{250-225}{3} = \\frac{25}{3}$.\nSum of Squares for Columns (clinicians): $SS_c = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^k C_j^2 - C = \\frac{1}{4}(10^2+9^2+11^2) - 75 = \\frac{1}{4}(100+81+121) - 75 = \\frac{302}{4} - 75 = 75.5 - 75 = 0.5$.\nSum of Squares for Error: $SS_e = SS_{tot} - SS_r - SS_c = 11 - \\frac{25}{3} - 0.5 = 11 - \\frac{25}{3} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{66-50-3}{6} = \\frac{13}{6}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the mean squares (MS) using the degrees of freedom (df):\n$df_r = n-1 = 4-1=3$.\n$df_c = k-1 = 3-1=2$.\n$df_e = (n-1)(k-1) = 3 \\times 2 = 6$.\nMean Square for Rows: $MS_r = \\frac{SS_r}{df_r} = \\frac{25/3}{3} = \\frac{25}{9}$.\nMean Square for Columns: $MS_c = \\frac{SS_c}{df_c} = \\frac{0.5}{2} = 0.25 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nMean Square for Error: $MS_e = \\frac{SS_e}{df_e} = \\frac{13/6}{6} = \\frac{13}{36}$.\n\nFinally, we substitute these MS values into the derived formula for $\\mathrm{ICC}(2,1)$:\n$$\\mathrm{ICC}(2,1) = \\frac{MS_r - MS_e}{MS_r + (k-1)MS_e + \\frac{k}{n}(MS_c - MS_e)}$$\nThe terms in the formula are:\nNumerator: $MS_r - MS_e = \\frac{25}{9} - \\frac{13}{36} = \\frac{100}{36} - \\frac{13}{36} = \\frac{87}{36}$.\nDenominator: $MS_r + (k-1)MS_e + \\frac{k}{n}(MS_c - MS_e) = \\frac{25}{9} + (3-1)\\frac{13}{36} + \\frac{3}{4}\\left(\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{13}{36}\\right)$.\nDenominator $= \\frac{100}{36} + 2\\left(\\frac{13}{36}\\right) + \\frac{3}{4}\\left(\\frac{9}{36} - \\frac{13}{36}\\right) = \\frac{100}{36} + \\frac{26}{36} + \\frac{3}{4}\\left(-\\frac{4}{36}\\right) = \\frac{126}{36} - \\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{123}{36}$.\n\nNow we compute the ratio:\n$$\\mathrm{ICC}(2,1) = \\frac{87/36}{123/36} = \\frac{87}{123}$$\nSimplifying the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by $3$:\n$$\\mathrm{ICC}(2,1) = \\frac{29}{41}$$\nThe numerical value is approximately $0.707317...$.

This exercise demonstrates how to process raw scores from a standardized instrument, the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0), by converting them to a universal metric and determining if the observed improvement is clinically meaningful. Mastering this process is crucial for both individual-level clinical management and for aggregating outcomes in program evaluation [@problem_id:4749978].", "problem": "A psychiatric rehabilitation program uses the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule $2.0$ ($12$-item version; WHODAS $2.0$) with simple scoring to monitor functional disability over time. Each item is rated on a $1$–$5$ Likert scale, where higher values indicate greater disability. In simple scoring, the raw score is the sum of the $12$ item scores, so the theoretical range is $12$ (least disability) to $60$ (greatest disability). To enable comparison across scales, the program linearly rescales the raw score to a $0$–$100$ metric by mapping the minimum possible raw score to $0$ and the maximum possible raw score to $100$ via an affine transformation. By convention for WHODAS $2.0$, higher values on the $0$–$100$ metric also indicate greater disability.\n\nA patient is assessed at baseline and after a $6$-month psychosocial rehabilitation intervention.

Let the subscript $b$ denote baseline and $f$ denote follow-up.\n\nFirst, we compute the patient’s raw simple-sum scores at baseline and follow-up.

This raw score interval $[12, 60]$ is mapped to the metric score interval $[0, 100]$.\n\nThe general formula for such a linear rescaling is:\n$$S_{metric} = (\\text{new maximum} - \\text{new minimum}) \\times \\frac{S_{raw} - \\text{old minimum}}{\\text{old maximum} - \\text{old minimum}} + \\text{new minimum}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$S_{metric} = (100 - 0) \\times \\frac{S_{raw} - 12}{60 - 12} + 0$$\n$$S_{metric} = 100 \\times \\frac{S_{raw} - 12}{48}$$\n\nUsing this transformation, we convert the patient's scores:\nFor the baseline score, $S_{raw, b} = 33$:\n$$S_{metric, b} = 100 \\times \\frac{33 - 12}{48} = 100 \\times \\frac{21}{48} = 100 \\times \\frac{7}{16} = \\frac{700}{16} = \\frac{175}{4} = 43.75$$\n\nFor the follow-up score, $S_{raw, f} = 24$:\n$$S_{metric, f} = 100 \\times \\frac{24 - 12}{48} = 100 \\times \\frac{12}{48} = 100 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 25$$\n\nThird, we compute the patient's absolute improvement on the $0$–$100$ metric, defined as baseline minus follow-up.
