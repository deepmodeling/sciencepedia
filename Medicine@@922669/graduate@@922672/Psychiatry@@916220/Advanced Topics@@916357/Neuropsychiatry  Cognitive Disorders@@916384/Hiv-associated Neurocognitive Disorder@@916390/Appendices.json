Mastering this calculation is fundamental to interpreting any diagnostic test and avoiding common clinical reasoning errors.", "problem": "A specialized neurology clinic conducts screening for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) among people living with HIV (PLWH) using a standardized cognitive screening tool. In a well-characterized subgroup with extensive neurovirology follow-up, the pre-test prevalence of HAND is $0.25$. Validation studies for the screening tool show a sensitivity of $0.80$ and a specificity of $0.70$ for detecting HAND in this subgroup.\n\nStarting from the definition of conditional probability and the law of total probability applied to the binary events of HAND and test positivity, derive the posterior probability of HAND given a positive screening result. Clearly state the assumptions needed to connect sensitivity and specificity to conditional probabilities and to apply the law of total probability in this context. Express your final answer exactly as a fraction (no rounding).", "solution": "Let $H$ be the event that a person from the specified subgroup has HAND, and let $T$ be the event that the screening tool yields a positive result. The complementary events are $H^c$ (the person does not have HAND) and $T^c$ (the test is negative).\n\nThe provided information can be translated into probabilistic terms:\n- The pre-test prevalence of HAND is the prior probability of the event $H$: $P(H) = 0.25$.\n- The probability of not having HAND is therefore $P(H^c) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n- The sensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the person has HAND. This is the conditional probability $P(T|H) = 0.80$.\n- The specificity is the probability of a negative test result given that the person does not have HAND. This is the conditional probability $P(T^c|H^c) = 0.70$.\n\nWe need to derive the posterior probability of HAND given a positive screening result, which is the conditional probability $P(H|T)$.\n\nAs required, we start with the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(H|T) = \\frac{P(H \\cap T)}{P(T)}$$\nwhere $P(H \\cap T)$ is the joint probability of having HAND and testing positive.\n\nThe numerator, $P(H \\cap T)$, can be expressed using the definition of conditional probability for $P(T|H)$:\n$$P(T|H) = \\frac{P(H \\cap T)}{P(H)} \\implies P(H \\cap T) = P(T|H)P(H)$$\nThis represents the probability of a true positive outcome.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. To find this, we apply the law of total probability. The events $H$ and $H^c$ form a partition of the sample space. Therefore, the event $T$ can be decomposed into two mutually exclusive events: testing positive with HAND ($T \\cap H$) and testing positive without HAND ($T \\cap H^c$).\n$$P(T) = P(T \\cap H) + P(T \\cap H^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term, we get:\n$$P(T) = P(T|H)P(H) + P(T|H^c)P(H^c)$$\n\nThe term $P(T|H^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given that the person does not have HAND (the false positive rate). This can be derived from the specificity:\n$$P(T|H^c) = 1 - P(T^c|H^c) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the numerator and denominator back into the formula for $P(H|T)$ yields Bayes' theorem for this case:\n$$P(H|T) = \\frac{P(T|H)P(H)}{P(T|H)P(H) + P(T|H^c)P(H^c)}$$\n\nThe assumptions required for this derivation are as follows:\n1.  **Validity of Parameters**: The stated values for prevalence ($0.25$), sensitivity ($0.80$), and specificity ($0.70$) are accurate for the population under consideration. This allows us to equate them directly with $P(H)$, $P(T|H)$, and $P(T^c|H^c)$, respectively.\n2.  **Completeness of Disease States**: The events $H$ (having HAND) and $H^c$ (not having HAND) are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. This means a person either has HAND or does not, with no other possibilities, allowing the use of $P(H^c) = 1 - P(H)$ and the application of the law of total probability across this partition. This is inherent in the binary classification of the disorder.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into the derived formula. To obtain an exact fraction, we first convert the decimal values to fractions:\n- $P(H) = 0.25 = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $P(H^c) = 0.75 = \\frac{3}{4}$\n- $P(T|H) = 0.80 = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}$\n- $P(T|H^c) = 0.30 = \\frac{3}{10}$\n\nPlugging these into the formula for $P(H|T)$:\n$$P(H|T) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)}$$\n$$P(H|T) = \\frac{\\frac{4}{20}}{\\frac{4}{20} + \\frac{9}{40}}$$\nSimplify the numerator and the first term in the denominator:\n$$P(H|T) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{5}}{\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{9}{40}}$$\nTo add the fractions in the denominator, we find a common denominator, which is $40$:\n$$P(H|T) = \\frac{\\frac{1 \\times 8}{5 \\times 8}}{\\frac{1 \\times 8}{5 \\times 8} + \\frac{9}{40}} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{40}}{\\frac{8}{40} + \\frac{9}{40}}$$\n$$P(H|T) = \\frac{\\frac{8}{40}}{\\frac{8+9}{40}} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{40}}{\\frac{17}{40}}$$\n$$P(H|T) = \\frac{8}{40} \\times \\frac{40}{17} = \\frac{8}{17}$$\nThe posterior probability of having HAND given a positive test result is $\\frac{8}{17}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{8}{17}}$$", "id": "4484943"}, {"introduction": "Following an initial screening, a comprehensive neuropsychological battery provides detailed data across various cognitive domains.
