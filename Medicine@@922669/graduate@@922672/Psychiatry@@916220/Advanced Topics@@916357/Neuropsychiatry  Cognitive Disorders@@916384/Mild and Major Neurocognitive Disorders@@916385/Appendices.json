The FAQ comprises $10$ informant-rated items, each scored on an ordinal scale where $0$ indicates independence, $1$ indicates difficulty, $2$ indicates the need for assistance, and $3$ indicates dependence. For this patient, the informant provides the following item-level scores:\n- Writing checks, paying bills, balancing checkbook: $2$\n- Assembling tax records, business affairs, or papers: $1$\n- Shopping alone for clothes, household necessities, or groceries: $2$\n- Playing a game of skill or working on a hobby: $1$\n- Heating water, making a cup of coffee, or turning off the stove: $0$\n- Preparing a balanced meal: $1$\n- Keeping track of current events: $1$\n- Paying attention, understanding, and discussing a television program, book, or magazine: $0$\n- Remembering appointments, family occasions, holidays, and medications: $1$\n- Traveling out of the neighborhood, driving, or arranging to take public transportation: $2$\n\nAs foundational clinical facts, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) defines mild neurocognitive disorder as cognitive decline that does not interfere with independence in everyday activities (although greater effort, compensatory strategies, or accommodations may be required), whereas major neurocognitive disorder requires cognitive decline sufficient to interfere with independence in everyday activities.

Do not include any units in your final answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the computation of an indicator variable, $I$, based on a patient's total score on the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). The process involves two primary steps: first, calculating the total score, $S$, and second, determining the value of $I$ based on a given threshold for $S$.\n\nThe FAQ consists of $N=10$ items. The scores for these items, which we can denote as $s_i$ for $i=1, 2, \\dots, 10$, are provided as follows:\n- $s_1 = 2$\n- $s_2 = 1$\n- $s_3 = 2$\n- $s_4 = 1$\n- $s_5 = 0$\n- $s_6 = 1$\n- $s_7 = 1$\n- $s_8 = 0$\n- $s_9 = 1$\n- $s_{10} = 2$\n\nThe total FAQ score, $S$, is defined as the unweighted sum of these $10$ item scores.

The definition of $I$ is based on whether functional independence is preserved. The operational criterion provided is:\n- Functional independence is preserved if $S < 9$.\n- Functional independence is not preserved if $S \\geq 9$.\n\nThe indicator variable $I$ is defined accordingly:\n- $I = 1$ if functional independence is preserved (i.e., if $S < 9$).\n- $I = 0$ if functional independence is not preserved (i.e., if $S \\geq 9$).\n\nWe must now apply this rule to our calculated score, $S = 11$. We compare $S$ to the threshold value of $9$.\nWe find that $11 \\geq 9$.\n\nAccording to the provided definition, when the condition $S \\geq 9$ is met, it signifies that functional independence is not preserved, and the indicator variable $I$ must be set to $0$.\n\nTherefore, for this patient with a total FAQ score of $S = 11$, the value of the indicator variable is $I=0$. This is consistent with the clinical context where a higher score indicates greater functional impairment, and a score of $S=11$ surpasses the threshold, suggesting a level of impairment consistent with major neurocognitive disorder.
