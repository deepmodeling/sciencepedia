Neurologic examination is notable for intermittent orofacial grimacing but no focal weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is unremarkable. An electroencephalogram (EEG) shows continuous 1–3 Hz delta activity with superimposed 20–30 Hz fast activity over frontotemporal regions, interpreted as an “extreme delta brush” pattern.

This is a pleocytosis.\n    - Protein: 52 mg/dL. This is a mild elevation (proteinorrachia).\n    - Glucose: Normal.\n    - Microbiology: CSF gram stain and cultures are negative.\n- **Serology:** A serum neuronal surface antibody panel is negative, including immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor, gamma-aminobutyric acid B receptor, leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1), and contactin-associated protein-like 2.\n\n**Foundational Base (Rules):**\n1.  **Possible autoimmune encephalitis:** Requires subacute onset (< 3 months) of altered mental status, memory deficits, or psychiatric symptoms, PLUS at least one of: new focal CNS findings, seizures, CSF pleocytosis, or suggestive MRI, WITH reasonable exclusion of alternatives.\n2.  **Definite N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis:** Requires detection of NMDAR subunit 1 IgG in CSF or serum, plus a compatible clinical syndrome.\n3.  **Autoantibody-negative but probable autoimmune encephalitis:** Requires a compatible presentation, exclusion of mimics, absence of well-characterized neuronal antibodies in **both serum and CSF**, AND at least two of: suggestive MRI, CSF inflammation (pleocytosis or elevated protein or oligoclonal bands), or suggestive EEG.\n4.  **EEG Fact:** The “extreme delta brush” pattern is a highly specific biomarker for anti-NMDAR encephalitis.\n5.  **Antibody Testing Fact:** For anti-NMDAR IgG, CSF testing has higher diagnostic sensitivity than serum testing; a negative serum test does not exclude a positive CSF test.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The clinical vignette describes a classic presentation of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis. The provided diagnostic criteria are a simplified but accurate representation of the consensus criteria published by Graus et al. in 2016. The statements regarding the specificity of the \"extreme delta brush\" EEG pattern and the relative sensitivities of serum versus CSF antibody testing are well-established facts in neurology and immunology. The problem does not violate any scientific principles.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear clinical scenario and a set of rules and facts to apply. There is sufficient information to derive a logical classification and determine the next best diagnostic step. A unique and meaningful solution can be reached by applying the provided base of knowledge.\n- **Objective:** The language is clinical, precise, and free of subjective or biased statements. The patient's findings and the diagnostic rules are presented as objective facts.\n\nThe problem is self-contained and internally consistent. It does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, etc.).\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe task is to classify the patient's syndrome and determine the next best diagnostic test based on the provided information.\n\n1.  **Application of Classification Criteria:**\n\n    - **Possible Autoimmune Encephalitis:**\n        - Subacute onset (< 3 months) of psychiatric symptoms? **Yes**, the patient developed symptoms over 2 weeks.\n        - At least one additional criterion?\n            - New focal CNS findings: **Yes**, the orofacial grimacing constitutes a new movement disorder (dyskinesia), which is a focal CNS finding.\n            - Seizures: Not mentioned, but not required if other criteria are met.\n            - CSF pleocytosis: **Yes**, the CSF has 18 white blood cells per $\\mu$L.\n            - MRI features suggestive of encephalitis: No, the MRI is unremarkable.\n        - Reasonable exclusion of alternative causes? **Yes**, CSF gram stain and cultures are negative, making an acute bacterial infection unlikely.\n        - **Conclusion:** The patient firmly meets the criteria for \"possible autoimmune encephalitis\".\n\n    - **Definite NMDAR Encephalitis:**\n        - This requires detection of NMDAR antibodies. The serum test was negative. The CSF has not yet been tested for antibodies.\n        - **Conclusion:** This diagnosis cannot be made at this time.\n\n    - **Autoantibody-negative but probable autoimmune encephalitis:**\n        - This requires the absence of antibodies in **both serum and CSF**.\n        - **Conclusion:** As CSF antibody status is unknown, this classification is not applicable.\n\n2.  **Integration of Additional Facts:**\n\n    - **EEG Finding:** The patient's EEG shows an \"extreme delta brush\" pattern. The problem states this is a \"highly specific biomarker associated with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis\". This finding elevates the clinical suspicion for this specific disorder from possible to highly probable, despite the negative serum antibody test.\n    - **Antibody Testing Sensitivity:** The problem explicitly states that for NMDAR IgG, \"CSF testing has higher diagnostic sensitivity than serum testing; a negative serum does not exclude a positive CSF.\"\n\n3.  **Synthesis of Classification and Next Step:**\n\n    - **Classification:** The most accurate classification at this stage is \"possible autoimmune encephalitis\" with a very high suspicion for anti-NMDAR encephalitis, driven by the combination of the clinical picture (young woman with psychiatric symptoms and dyskinesias) and the highly specific \"extreme delta brush\" EEG pattern.\n    - **Next Test:** Given that the serum antibody test is negative but does not rule out the diagnosis, and that CSF testing is more sensitive, the single most logical and crucial next diagnostic step is to test the cerebrospinal fluid for NMDAR antibodies.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A. Classification: Possible autoimmune encephalitis with high suspicion for anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis; Next test: CSF neuronal surface antibody panel using a cell-based assay, with specific testing for IgG against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 1.**\n    - **Classification:** This is the most accurate and precise classification. It correctly identifies the syndrome as \"possible autoimmune encephalitis\" based on the formal criteria and correctly notes the \"high suspicion for anti-NMDAR encephalitis\" based on the specific EEG biomarker.\n    - **Next test:** This is the correct next step. It directly addresses the diagnostic uncertainty from the negative serum test by proposing the more sensitive test (CSF antibodies), which is required to confirm or refute the leading diagnosis.\n    - **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n- **B. Classification: Probable anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis; Next test: Skip CSF antibody testing and begin first-line immunotherapy only.**\n    - **Classification:** The term \"probable\" is not formally defined in the provided rules in a way that fits this patient's current status. Furthermore, while the suspicion is high, making a \"probable\" diagnosis without awaiting the definitive test is premature.\n    - **Next test:** Skipping CSF antibody testing is incorrect. It ignores the foundational fact that a negative serum test is insufficient and that CSF testing is more sensitive. While immunotherapy is the eventual treatment, establishing a firm diagnosis is the critical next step.\n    - **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. Classification: Autoantibody-negative but probable autoimmune encephalitis; Next test: Proceed to brain biopsy to evaluate for primary central nervous system vasculitis.**\n    - **Classification:** This classification is explicitly incorrect. The criteria for \"autoantibody-negative\" require the absence of antibodies in *both* serum and CSF. The CSF has not yet been tested.\n    - **Next test:** A brain biopsy is an invasive, high-risk procedure that is not indicated. A non-invasive and highly specific test (CSF antibodies) is available and strongly suggested by the clinical data. There is no evidence in the vignette to suggest primary CNS vasculitis over NMDAR encephalitis.\n    - **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. Classification: Primary schizophrenia spectrum disorder; Next test: Increase antipsychotic dosing and defer further neurologic testing.**\n    - **Classification:** This ignores multiple red flags for an organic neurologic disease: subacute onset in a previously healthy individual, objective CSF inflammation (pleocytosis), and a highly specific, pathological EEG pattern. Attributing this to a primary psychiatric disorder would be a serious diagnostic error.\n    - **Next test:** Deferring neurologic testing would lead to a delay in diagnosis and treatment of a serious but treatable condition.\n    - **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n- **E. Classification: Suspected limbic encephalitis due to leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1; Next test: Repeat serum voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibodies only.**\n    - **Classification:** This is inconsistent with the evidence. The serum panel was already negative for LGI1. More importantly, the highly specific \"extreme delta brush\" EEG points strongly to NMDAR encephalitis, not LGI1-associated encephalitis.\n    - **Next test:** Repeating a negative serum test is illogical, especially when the clinical picture points to a different diagnosis for which a more sensitive test (CSF for NMDAR) is indicated.\n    - **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4691627"}, {"introduction": "Once autoimmune encephalitis is suspected or confirmed, managing severe neuropsychiatric symptoms becomes an immediate priority.

By considering the underlying pathophysiology of NMDAR hypofunction and its effect on dopamine circuits, you will learn to justify the cautious use of antipsychotics and prioritize therapies that minimize the risk of worsening movement disorders. This exercise hones the crucial skill of tailoring pharmacotherapy to the specific neurobiological state of the patient.", "problem": "A $24$-year-old woman is admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with confirmed Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis after cerebrospinal fluid antibodies and a pelvic mass consistent with an ovarian teratoma were identified. She exhibits severe agitation, insomnia, prominent orofacial dyskinesias, choreoathetoid limb movements, and labile blood pressure consistent with autonomic instability. The medical team has initiated immunotherapy (high-dose corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin), and you are consulted for acute psychiatric symptom control. The team is considering antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and other sedatives.\n\nYou are asked to reason from first principles of receptor pharmacology and basal ganglia circuit physiology. Use the following foundational bases:\n\n- Fundamental definition of receptor occupancy relates to ligand concentration and affinity; higher affinity (lower dissociation constant) at a receptor yields greater occupancy at a given free concentration.\n- Well-tested observation in psychopharmacology: extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and acute dystonias are correlated with dopamine $\\mathrm{D2}$ receptor occupancy above a threshold, commonly cited near $60$–$80\\%$.\n- Anti-NMDAR encephalitis causes antibody-mediated internalization and hypofunction of NMDAR, dysregulating cortical-striatal-thalamic circuits and often leading to disinhibited subcortical dopamine tone and dyskinesias.\n- Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid type A (GABA$_\\mathrm{A}$) receptor positive allosteric modulation increases chloride conductance, hyperpolarizes neurons, and reduces network excitability.\n\nAssume typical dopamine $\\mathrm{D2}$ receptor dissociation constants ($K_d$) at physiological conditions: haloperidol $K_d \\approx 1\\ \\mathrm{nM}$, risperidone $K_d \\approx 2\\ \\mathrm{nM}$, olanzapine $K_d \\approx 5\\ \\mathrm{nM}$, quetiapine $K_d \\approx 150\\ \\mathrm{nM}$. In anti-NMDAR encephalitis with prominent dyskinesias and autonomic instability, select the most appropriate immediate pharmacologic strategy for agitation and movement symptoms that is justified by receptor pharmacology, basal ganglia physiology, and the disease’s pathophysiology.\n\nWhich option best meets these criteria?\n\nA. Initiate high-potency dopamine $\\mathrm{D2}$ antagonism with haloperidol $5$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ intravenously every $6$ hours, titrating to behavioral control, accepting EPS risk as necessary in severe agitation.\n\nB. Prioritize benzodiazepine-centric management with lorazepam $1$–$2$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ intravenously in repeated doses to target sedation and catatonia, avoid or minimize $\\mathrm{D2}$ receptor blockade, and if an antipsychotic is required, use a very low-dose, low-$\\mathrm{D2}$-occupancy agent such as quetiapine $12.5$–$25$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ orally with careful monitoring.\n\nC. Add amantadine $100$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ twice daily to reduce dyskinesias through dopaminergic mechanisms and NMDAR antagonism, combined with risperidone $1$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ twice daily for psychosis.\n\nD. Use a ketamine infusion for rapid control of agitation via NMDAR antagonism and pair with olanzapine $10$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ nightly to maintain antipsychotic coverage.\n\nE. Prefer dexmedetomidine infusion (alpha-$2$ adrenergic agonism) for sedation while avoiding benzodiazepines due to paradoxical disinhibition; if antipsychotics are needed, select low-dose risperidone $0.5$–$1$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ nightly.", "solution": "Begin from the fundamental definitions and well-tested observations:\n\n1. Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis pathophysiology: Antibodies crosslink and internalize NMDAR, producing NMDAR hypofunction. NMDAR hypofunction reduces glutamatergic drive on cortical-striatal-thalamic circuits, disrupts inhibitory-excitatory balance, and is often accompanied by disinhibited subcortical dopamine tone with prominent dyskinesias, agitation, and autonomic instability.\n\n2. Dopamine $\\mathrm{D2}$ receptor occupancy and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS): EPS correlates with $\\mathrm{D2}$ occupancy above a threshold commonly cited near $60$–$80\\%$. High-potency antipsychotics with low $K_d$ (high affinity) produce high occupancy at modest brain free drug concentrations. The equilibrium occupancy relation at steady state is given by the standard receptor binding model: $$\\theta = \\frac{[D]}{[D] + K_d},$$ where $\\theta$ is fractional occupancy, $[D]$ is free drug concentration at the receptor, and $K_d$ is the dissociation constant.\n\n3. GABAergic modulation: Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid type A (GABA$_\\mathrm{A}$) receptor positive allosteric modulators (benzodiazepines) increase chloride influx, hyperpolarize neurons, reduce network excitability, and treat catatonia. They do not increase $\\mathrm{D2}$ occupancy and therefore do not directly exacerbate dyskinesias via $\\mathrm{D2}$ blockade.\n\nApplying receptor pharmacology quantitatively to antipsychotic choices:\n\n- Consider a plausible free brain drug concentration $[D] \\approx 10$ $\\mathrm{nM}$ during typical clinical dosing. For haloperidol ($K_d \\approx 1$ $\\mathrm{nM}$): $$\\theta_\\text{halo} \\approx \\frac{10}{10 + 1} \\approx \\frac{10}{11} \\approx 0.91 \\text{ or } 91\\%,$$ far above the $60$–$80\\%$ EPS threshold, implying high risk of dystonia, parkinsonism, and worsening of dyskinesias.\n\n- For risperidone ($K_d \\approx 2$ $\\mathrm{nM}$): $$\\theta_\\text{risp} \\approx \\frac{10}{10 + 2} \\approx \\frac{10}{12} \\approx 0.83 \\text{ or } 83\\%,$$ also above the EPS threshold.\n\n- For olanzapine ($K_d \\approx 5$ $\\mathrm{nM}$): $$\\theta_\\text{olz} \\approx \\frac{10}{10 + 5} \\approx \\frac{10}{15} \\approx 0.67 \\text{ or } 67\\%,$$ near the threshold; still a substantial risk of EPS in a dyskinesia-prone state.\n\n- For quetiapine ($K_d \\approx 150$ $\\mathrm{nM}$): $$\\theta_\\text{quet} \\approx \\frac{10}{10 + 150} \\approx \\frac{10}{160} \\approx 0.0625 \\text{ or } 6.25\\%,$$ well below the EPS range; at very low doses, $\\mathrm{D2}$ occupancy remains minimal, with sedation mediated largely via histamine $\\mathrm{H1}$ and alpha-1 adrenergic antagonism.\n\nClinical integration with anti-NMDAR encephalitis pathophysiology:\n\n- Because NMDAR hypofunction is already present, further antagonism at NMDAR (e.g., ketamine, amantadine’s NMDA component) risks exacerbating neuropsychiatric symptoms, worsening agitation or dyskinesias, and undermining circuit recovery, even if some agents have ancillary benefits elsewhere.\n\n- High $\\mathrm{D2}$ blockade in a state of disinhibited dopaminergic tone paradoxically increases risk for EPS and can obscure or worsen movement symptoms, precipitate rigidity, and complicate autonomic instability (including a neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like picture).\n\n- Benzodiazepines are rational first-line in this context: they augment GABAergic inhibitory tone, reduce agitation, help catatonia, and avoid the movement risks tied to $\\mathrm{D2}$ occupancy. Careful titration (e.g., lorazepam $1$–$2$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ intravenously in repeated doses) permits symptom control while monitoring for respiratory depression and autonomic effects. If an antipsychotic is necessary, choosing a low $\\mathrm{D2}$-occupancy agent at minimal dose (e.g., quetiapine $12.5$–$25$ $\\mathrm{mg}$) aligns with receptor occupancy principles to minimize EPS risk.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Haloperidol $5$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ intravenously every $6$ hours implies sustained high free brain levels. Given haloperidol’s $K_d \\approx 1$ $\\mathrm{nM}$, occupancy estimates near $90\\%$ at plausible $[D]$ exceed the EPS threshold. In anti-NMDAR encephalitis with dyskinesias, this strategy risks worsening movement symptoms, rigidity, and autonomic complications. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nB. Benzodiazepine-centric management with lorazepam $1$–$2$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ intravenously targets GABA$_\\mathrm{A}$-mediated inhibitory tone, improves catatonia and agitation without $\\mathrm{D2}$ blockade, and minimizes risk of EPS. If antipsychotics are necessary, quetiapine at very low dose maintains very low $\\mathrm{D2}$ occupancy ($\\sim 6\\%$ at $[D] \\approx 10$ $\\mathrm{nM}$), reducing movement risk, while providing sedation via off-target mechanisms. This approach is consistent with receptor pharmacology and anti-NMDAR pathophysiology. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. Amantadine $100$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ twice daily adds NMDA antagonism in a disorder of NMDAR hypofunction, theoretically worsening the core pathophysiology; its dopaminergic effects can exacerbate dyskinesias. Pairing with risperidone ($K_d \\approx 2$ $\\mathrm{nM}$, occupancy $\\sim 83\\%$) increases EPS risk. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Ketamine infusion provides potent NMDAR antagonism, contraindicated conceptually in NMDAR hypofunction; it can worsen psychosis, dysautonomia, and hallucinations. Olanzapine $10$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ yields $\\mathrm{D2}$ occupancy in the EPS range ($\\sim 67\\%$ at $[D] \\approx 10$ $\\mathrm{nM}$). Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. Dexmedetomidine (alpha-2 agonist) can be useful for ICU sedation and autonomic control, but avoiding benzodiazepines categorically because of rare paradoxical disinhibition ignores their established utility in catatonia and anti-NMDAR agitation. Adding risperidone low-dose still risks high $\\mathrm{D2}$ occupancy relative to its $K_d$ when titrated, potentially worsening dyskinesias. While dexmedetomidine is a plausible adjunct, this option fails the benzodiazepine-centric rationale and retains problematic $\\mathrm{D2}$ blockade.

The patient is not IgA-deficient and has no history of thromboembolism; you will ensure aggressive oral hydration and consider low-threshold reduction of rates if dysautonomia worsens.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of dose-per-kilogram, solution concentration, volumetric flow rate, and time-volume relationships, compute the total cumulative infusion time across all $5$ days under the stated protocol, assuming full tolerance with no interruptions or rate reductions.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to compute a unique solution. The clinical context provided is consistent with established medical practice for treating autoimmune encephalitis and serves to frame a well-defined quantitative problem. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the total cumulative infusion time over a period of $N = 5$ days. To find this, we first must calculate the total infusion time for a single day and then multiply the result by the number of days.\n\nFirst, let us define the given parameters:\n- Patient's weight, $W = 70\\ \\text{kg}$\n- Total Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) dose per kilogram of body weight, $D_{kg} = 2\\ \\text{g/kg}$\n- Total duration of the treatment course, $N = 5\\ \\text{days}$\n- Concentration of the IVIG solution, $C = 0.1\\ \\text{g/mL}$\n\nThe total mass of IVIG to be administered over the entire course is the product of the dose per kilogram and the patient's weight:\n$$M_{total} = D_{kg} \\times W = (2\\ \\text{g/kg}) \\times (70\\ \\text{kg}) = 140\\ \\text{g}$$\n\nThis total mass is administered over $N = 5$ consecutive days.

Let's calculate the volume infused and time elapsed for each stage. The rates are given in $\\text{mL/kg/h}$, so we first calculate the volumetric flow rate, $F$, for each stage by multiplying the rate by the patient's weight $W$.\n\nStage 1:\n- Rate, $R_1 = 0.5\\ \\text{mL/kg/h}$\n- Flow rate, $F_1 = R_1 \\times W = (0.5\\ \\text{mL/kg/h}) \\times (70\\ \\text{kg}) = 35\\ \\text{mL/h}$\n- Duration, $T_1 = 30\\ \\text{min} = 0.5\\ \\text{h}$\n- Volume infused in Stage 1, $V_1 = F_1 \\times T_1 = (35\\ \\text{mL/h}) \\times (0.5\\ \\text{h}) = 17.5\\ \\text{mL}$\n\nStage 2:\n- Rate, $R_2 = 1.0\\ \\text{mL/kg/h}$\n- Flow rate, $F_2 = R_2 \\times W = (1.0\\ \\text{mL/kg/h}) \\times (70\\ \\text{kg}) = 70\\ \\text{mL/h}$\n- Duration, $T_2 = 30\\ \\text{min} = 0.5\\ \\text{h}$\n- Volume infused in Stage 2, $V_2 = F_2 \\times T_2 = (70\\ \\text{mL/h}) \\times (0.5\\ \\text{h}) = 35\\ \\text{mL}$\n\nStage 3:\n- Rate, $R_3 = 2.0\\ \\text{mL/kg/h}$\n- Flow rate, $F_3 = R_3 \\times W = (2.0\\ \\text{mL/kg/h}) \\times (70\\ \\text{kg}) = 140\\ \\text{mL/h}$\n- Duration, $T_3 = 60\\ \\text{min} = 1.0\\ \\text{h}$\n- Volume infused in Stage 3, $V_3 = F_3 \\times T_3 = (140\\ \\text{mL/h}) \\times (1.0\\ \\text{h}) = 140\\ \\text{mL}$\n\nThe total volume infused after the first three stages is the sum $V_1 + V_2 + V_3$:\n$$V_{1-3} = 17.5\\ \\text{mL} + 35\\ \\text{mL} + 140\\ \\text{mL} = 192.5\\ \\text{mL}$$\n\nThe remaining volume to be infused in Stage 4, $V_4$, is the daily total volume minus the volume infused in the first three stages:\n$$V_4 = V_{day} - V_{1-3} = 280\\ \\text{mL} - 192.5\\ \\text{mL} = 87.5\\ \\text{mL}$$\n\nStage 4 runs until this remaining volume is delivered. The flow rate for Stage 4 is:\n- Rate, $R_4 = 4.0\\ \\text{mL/kg/h}$\n- Flow rate, $F_4 = R_4 \\times W = (4.0\\ \\text{mL/kg/h}) \\times (70\\ \\text{kg}) = 280\\ \\text{mL/h}$\n\nThe time required for Stage 4, $T_4$, is the volume to be infused divided by the flow rate:\n$$T_4 = \\frac{V_4}{F_4} = \\frac{87.5\\ \\text{mL}}{280\\ \\text{mL/h}} = 0.3125\\ \\text{h}$$\n\nThe total infusion time for a single day, $T_{day\\_total}$, is the sum of the durations of all four stages:\n$$T_{day\\_total} = T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_4 = 0.5\\ \\text{h} + 0.5\\ \\text{h} + 1.0\\ \\text{h} + 0.3125\\ \\text{h} = 2.3125\\ \\text{h}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the total cumulative infusion time across all $N=5$ days, $T_{cumulative}$. Assuming the protocol is followed without interruptions for each of the $5$ days:\n$$T_{cumulative} = T_{day\\_total} \\times N = 2.3125\\ \\text{h/day} \\times 5\\ \\text{days} = 11.5625\\ \\text{h}$$\n\nThe final answer must be rounded to four significant figures. The number $11.5625$ has six significant figures. Rounding to four significant figures gives $11.56$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11.56}$$", "id": "4691590"}]}
