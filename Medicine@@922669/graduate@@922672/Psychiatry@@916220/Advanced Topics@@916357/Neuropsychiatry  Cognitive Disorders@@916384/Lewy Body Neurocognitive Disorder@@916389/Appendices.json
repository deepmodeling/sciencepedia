In Lewy body neurocognitive disorder, autonomic nervous system dysfunction impairs baroreflex-mediated vascular responses, predisposing to orthostatic hypotension. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is operationally defined, by widely used consensus criteria, as a decrease in systolic blood pressure (BP) of at least $20$ millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or a decrease in diastolic BP of at least $10$ mmHg measured within $3$ minutes of standing from supine rest.\n\nAfter $5$ minutes supine rest, the patient’s supine systolic BP is $140$ mmHg and supine diastolic BP is $80$ mmHg. At $3$ minutes after standing, the systolic BP is $110$ mmHg and the diastolic BP is $70$ mmHg.\n\nUsing the consensus definition above and taking the orthostatic drops as $\\Delta SBP = SBP_{\\text{supine}} - SBP_{\\text{standing}}$ and $\\Delta DBP = DBP_{\\text{supine}} - DBP_{\\text{standing}}$, compute the indicator function\n$$I = \\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if } \\Delta SBP \\ge 20 \\text{ or } \\Delta DBP \\ge 10 \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$$\nfor this patient at $3$ minutes.

Normally, upon standing, venous pooling reduces venous return, transiently lowering stroke volume and arterial pressure; intact baroreflexes increase heart rate and peripheral vascular resistance to counteract this. In autonomic failure, these compensations are blunted, leading to sustained orthostatic reductions in blood pressure.\n\nThe consensus operational definition of orthostatic hypotension (OH) states that within $3$ minutes of standing, there is OH if either the systolic blood pressure decreases by at least $20$ mmHg or the diastolic blood pressure decreases by at least $10$ mmHg compared to the supine measurement.\n\nWe compute the orthostatic drops from the given values:\n- Supine systolic blood pressure $SBP_{\\text{supine}} = 140$ mmHg; standing systolic blood pressure at $3$ minutes $SBP_{\\text{standing}} = 110$ mmHg. Thus,\n$$\\Delta SBP = SBP_{\\text{supine}} - SBP_{\\text{standing}} = 140 - 110 = 30.$$\n- Supine diastolic blood pressure $DBP_{\\text{supine}} = 80$ mmHg; standing diastolic blood pressure at $3$ minutes $DBP_{\\text{standing}} = 70$ mmHg. Thus,\n$$\\Delta DBP = DBP_{\\text{supine}} - DBP_{\\text{standing}} = 80 - 70 = 10.$$\n\nWe now evaluate the indicator function:\n$$I = \\begin{cases}\n1, & \\text{if } \\Delta SBP \\ge 20 \\text{ or } \\Delta DBP \\ge 10 \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}.$$\n\nHere, $\\Delta SBP = 30 \\ge 20$ is true, and $\\Delta DBP = 10 \\ge 10$ is also true.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has Lewy body neurocognitive disorder, and let $T_+$ be the event that the patient has a positive DaTscan result.\n\nWe are given the following information:\nThe pre-test probability, or prior probability, is $P(D) = p_{\\text{prior}} = 0.30$.\nThe positive likelihood ratio is $LR_{+} = 5$.\n\nThe task is to find the posterior probability, $P(D|T_+)$, which is the probability of the disorder given the positive test result. We will use the odds form of Bayes' theorem as requested.\n\nThe odds of an event $A$ are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring, $O(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{1 - P(A)}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the prior odds of having the disorder, $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{prior}}(D)$:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{prior}}(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{1 - P(D)} = \\frac{0.30}{1 - 0.30} = \\frac{0.30}{0.70} = \\frac{3}{7}\n$$\n\nThe odds form of Bayes' theorem states that the posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio. Let us derive this relationship.\nThe posterior odds are given by $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{posterior}}(D|T_+) = \\frac{P(D|T_+)}{P(D^c|T_+)}$, where $D^c$ is the complement of $D$.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, we have:\n$$\nP(D|T_+) = \\frac{P(T_+|D)P(D)}{P(T_+)}\n$$\n$$\nP(D^c|T_+) = \\frac{P(T_+|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T_+)}\n$$\n\nDividing these two expressions gives the posterior odds:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{posterior}}(D|T_+) = \\frac{P(D|T_+)}{P(D^c|T_+)} = \\frac{P(T_+|D)P(D)/P(T_+)}{P(T_+|D^c)P(D^c)/P(T_+)} = \\frac{P(T_+|D)P(D)}{P(T_+|D^c)P(D^c)}\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{posterior}}(D|T_+) = \\left(\\frac{P(T_+|D)}{P(T_+|D^c)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)}\\right)\n$$\nThe first term is the definition of the positive likelihood ratio, $LR_+$. The problem states that $LR_{+} = \\frac{\\text{sensitivity}}{1-\\text{specificity}} = \\frac{P(T_+|D)}{P(T_+|D^c)}$. The second term is the definition of the prior odds. Thus, we have derived the required relationship:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{posterior}} = LR_{+} \\times \\text{Odds}_{\\text{prior}}\n$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the posterior odds for the patient:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{posterior}} = 5 \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{15}{7}\n$$\n\nFinally, we convert the posterior odds back to the posterior probability, $p_{\\text{post}} = P(D|T_+)$.

This represents a moderate clinical suspicion based on symptoms but carries significant diagnostic uncertainty. After the positive DaTscan, the posterior probability has increased to $p_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.6818$, or approximately $68\\%$. This more than doubling of the probability substantially alters diagnostic confidence. A probability of nearly $70\\%$ is often sufficient to cross a \"diagnostic threshold,\" allowing the clinician to establish a working diagnosis with much greater certainty. This increased confidence directly influences decision-making by justifying a management plan tailored to Lewy body neurocognitive disorder, which can have different prognostic and therapeutic considerations than its common mimics like Alzheimer's disease. For example, it provides a stronger rationale for initiating specific pharmacotherapies and for counseling the patient and family about the expected disease course. However, it is crucial to recognize that a probability of $68\\%$ is not certainty; there remains a non-trivial chance (approximately $32\\%$) that the diagnosis is incorrect (i.e., a false positive result), and ongoing clinical monitoring remains essential.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6818}\n$$", "id": "4722130"}, {"introduction": "After establishing a diagnosis, the focus of care often shifts to managing burdensome symptoms such as psychosis.
