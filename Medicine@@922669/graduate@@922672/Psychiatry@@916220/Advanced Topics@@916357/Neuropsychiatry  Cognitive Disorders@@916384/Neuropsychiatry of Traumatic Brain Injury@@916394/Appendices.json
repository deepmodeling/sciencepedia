It is a well-defined quantitative problem in applied psychology.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe first step is to compute the $z$-scores for the patient's immediate and delayed recall performance. The $z$-score is a standardized value that indicates how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of its distribution. The formula for a $z$-score is:\n$$z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\nwhere $X$ is the individual's raw score, $\\mu$ is the mean of the normative population, and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the normative population.\n\nFor the immediate recall (RAVLT trials I-V), the patient's score is $X_{I} = 20$. The normative parameters are $\\mu_{I} = 50$ and $\\sigma_{I} = 9$. The corresponding $z$-score, $z_{I}$, is calculated as:\n$$z_{I} = \\frac{X_{I} - \\mu_{I}}{\\sigma_{I}} = \\frac{20 - 50}{9} = \\frac{-30}{9} = -\\frac{10}{3}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $-3.3333...$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $z_{I} \\approx -3.333$.\n\nFor the $20$-minute delayed recall, the patient's score is $X_{D} = 5$. The normative parameters are $\\mu_{D} = 10.5$ and $\\sigma_{D} = 2.5$. The corresponding $z$-score, $z_{D}$, is calculated as:\n$$z_{D} = \\frac{X_{D} - \\mu_{D}}{\\sigma_{D}} = \\frac{5 - 10.5}{2.5} = \\frac{-5.5}{2.5} = -2.2$$\nTo express this value with four significant figures, we write it as $-2.200$.\n\nThe next step is to apply the decision rule to classify the pattern of impairment. This requires calculating the metric $\\Delta = |z_{I}| - |z_{D}|$. Using the computed $z$-scores:\n$$|z_{I}| = |-3.333...| \\approx 3.333$$\n$$|z_{D}| = |-2.200| = 2.200$$\nNow, we compute $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta \\approx 3.333 - 2.200 = 1.133$$\nWe compare this value to the thresholds given in the classification rule.\n- First condition: Is $\\Delta \\geq 0.5$?\n  $$1.133 \\geq 0.5$$\n  This condition is true. According to the rule, if $\\Delta \\geq 0.5$, the classification code is $c = 0$. This indicates a performance pattern where the impairment in immediate recall (often linked to learning and executive strategy) is substantially greater than the impairment in delayed recall (linked to consolidation), suggestive of predominant frontal/executive dysfunction.\n\nSince the first condition is met, we do not need to evaluate the others. The classification code is $c=0$.\n\nFinally, we assemble the results into the required row matrix format $\\begin{pmatrix} z_{I} & z_{D} & c \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe values are $z_{I} \\approx -3.333$, $z_{D} = -2.200$, and $c = 0$.\n\nThe resulting matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} -3.333 & -2.200 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -3.333 & -2.200 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4734098"}, {"introduction": "Translating research findings into effective clinical practice requires a nuanced understanding of treatment efficacy.

Consider a randomized controlled trial that reports stratum-specific response probabilities to SSRI versus placebo at eight weeks for post-TBI major depressive disorder, stratified by lesion location, with response defined as a clinically significant reduction in depressive symptom severity on a validated scale.\n\nLet the two strata be: frontal lobe lesions involving the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), denoted stratum $i=1$, and non-frontal lesions primarily involving temporo-limbic circuits, denoted stratum $i=2$.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of biostatistics, epidemiology, and neuropsychiatry. The provided data are complete, consistent, and sufficient to compute a unique solution. The question is well-posed and objective. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe central task is to compute the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) for a specific clinic population, which is a mixture of two distinct strata defined by the location of a traumatic brain injury (TBI). The NNT is a measure of treatment effect size, representing the average number of patients who need to be treated with an intervention (here, an SSRI) to prevent one additional bad outcome or, equivalently, to achieve one additional good outcome (here, a response) compared to a control (placebo). It is the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Difference (ARD), also known as the Absolute Risk Reduction.\n\nFirst, let us establish the scientific rationale for stratifying by lesion location, as requested. In neuropsychiatry, lesion location is a critical variable because different brain circuits subserve different functions. Lesion location acts as a moderator of treatment response, meaning the magnitude of the treatment effect differs depending on the location of the injury.\n- Stratum $1$ involves the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The DLPFC is a key node in the brain's executive control network. Depression following a lesion in this area is often characterized by apathy, amotivation, and executive dysfunction (e.g., problems with planning and initiation). These \"depressive-like\" symptoms may arise from a disruption of frontal-subcortical circuits rather than from the primary monoaminergic dysregulation typically targeted by SSRIs.\n- Stratum $2$ involves temporo-limbic circuits, including regions like the amygdala and hippocampus. These are core areas for emotion processing, memory, and stress regulation. Depression following injury to these circuits is more likely to resemble \"classic\" major depression, driven by dysregulation of mood and affect. SSRIs are known to modulate serotonergic activity within these very circuits, which is believed to be their primary mechanism of action for alleviating affective symptoms.\nTherefore, it is neurobiologically plausible that SSRIs would have a different efficacy in these two groups, justifying the stratification in the a-priori analysis plan. The provided data ($p_{t,1}-p_{c,1} \\neq p_{t,2}-p_{c,2}$) confirm this moderation effect.\n\nNow, we proceed with the calculation. The NNT for the total population, denoted $NNT_{pop}$, is defined as the reciprocal of the population-wide absolute risk difference, $ARD_{pop}$.\n$$NNT_{pop} = \\frac{1}{ARD_{pop}}$$\nThe $ARD_{pop}$ is the difference between the overall probability of response in the treated group ($p_{t,pop}$) and the overall probability of response in the control group ($p_{c,pop}$) for the target clinic population.\n$$ARD_{pop} = p_{t,pop} - p_{c,pop}$$\nThe problem provides the stratum-specific response probabilities and the proportions of each stratum within the clinic population. Let $i=1$ and $i=2$ denote the two strata. The givens are:\n- Proportions (weights) of each stratum in the clinic population: $w_1 = 0.40$ and $w_2 = 0.60$.\n- Response probabilities for Stratum $1$: $p_{t,1} = 0.36$ (treatment) and $p_{c,1} = 0.28$ (control).\n- Response probabilities for Stratum $2$: $p_{t,2} = 0.52$ (treatment) and $p_{c,2} = 0.33$ (control).\n\nThe crucial step is to calculate the overall population response probabilities, $p_{t,pop}$ and $p_{c,pop}$. We use the law of total probability. The overall probability of response in the treated group is the weighted average of the stratum-specific response probabilities, where the weights are the proportions of each stratum in the population.\n$$p_{t,pop} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} p_{t,i} w_i = p_{t,1}w_1 + p_{t,2}w_2$$\nSimilarly, for the control group:\n$$p_{c,pop} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} p_{c,i} w_i = p_{c,1}w_1 + p_{c,2}w_2$$\nSubstituting these into the equation for $ARD_{pop}$:\n$$ARD_{pop} = (p_{t,1}w_1 + p_{t,2}w_2) - (p_{c,1}w_1 + p_{c,2}w_2)$$\nThis can be rearranged by grouping terms by stratum:\n$$ARD_{pop} = (p_{t,1} - p_{c,1})w_1 + (p_{t,2} - p_{c,2})w_2$$\nLet's define the stratum-specific absolute risk differences, $ARD_1$ and $ARD_2$:\n$$ARD_1 = p_{t,1} - p_{c,1}$$\n$$ARD_2 = p_{t,2} - p_{c,2}$$\nSo, the population ARD is the weighted average of the stratum-specific ARDs:\n$$ARD_{pop} = ARD_1 w_1 + ARD_2 w_2$$\nThis formula is valid under the stated assumptions of exchangeability, consistency, and positivity, which allow us to transport the stratum-specific causal effects from the trial to the target population.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values. First, calculate the stratum-specific ARDs:\nFor Stratum $1$:\n$$ARD_1 = 0.36 - 0.28 = 0.08$$\nFor Stratum $2$:\n$$ARD_2 = 0.52 - 0.33 = 0.19$$\nNext, calculate the population ARD using the weights $w_1 = 0.40$ and $w_2 = 0.60$:\n$$ARD_{pop} = (0.08)(0.40) + (0.19)(0.60)$$\n$$ARD_{pop} = 0.032 + 0.114$$\n$$ARD_{pop} = 0.146$$\nFinally, we compute the NNT for the clinic population:\n$$NNT_{pop} = \\frac{1}{ARD_{pop}} = \\frac{1}{0.146}$$\n$$NNT_{pop} \\approx 6.84931506...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$NNT_{pop} \\approx 6.849$$\nThis means that in this specific clinic population, one would need to treat, on average, approximately $7$ patients with an SSRI instead of a placebo for one additional patient to achieve a clinically significant response to treatment for post-TBI depression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.849}$$", "id": "4734044"}]}
