From the foundational principles of sampling in signal processing, a continuous-time oscillation at frequency $f$ sampled at rate $f_s$ produces a discrete-time sequence whose spectral content is constrained to the baseband from $0$ to $f_s/2$, and higher-frequency content can be folded into this baseband if $f_s$ is insufficient.

It presents a standard application of the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem within the valid context of neurophysiological signal processing (EEG). All provided information is factual and consistent. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts: first, an explanation for the phenomenon of aliasing in the context of undersampling, and second, a calculation of the minimum required sampling rate based on the Shannon-Nyquist criterion.\n\nPart 1: Explanation of Aliasing\n\nAliasing is a fundamental effect in digital signal processing that occurs when a continuous-time signal is sampled at a rate insufficient to capture its high-frequency content. Let a continuous-time sinusoidal signal, representing a simplified brain oscillation, be described by the function:\n$$x(t) = A \\cos(2\\pi f t + \\phi)$$\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude, $f$ is the frequency in $\\mathrm{Hz}$, $t$ is time, and $\\phi$ is the phase.\n\nTo process this signal digitally, it is sampled at discrete time intervals, $t = nT_s$, where $T_s = 1/f_s$ is the sampling period, $f_s$ is the sampling frequency in $\\mathrm{Hz}$, and $n$ is an integer ($n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$). The resulting discrete-time sequence is:\n$$x[n] = x(nT_s) = A \\cos\\left(2\\pi f \\frac{n}{f_s} + \\phi\\right)$$\nThe term $2\\pi f / f_s$ is the normalized discrete-time angular frequency, denoted as $\\omega$. Thus, $x[n] = A \\cos(\\omega n + \\phi)$.\n\nA core property of discrete-time sinusoids is their periodic nature with respect to frequency. Due to the identity $\\cos(\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta + 2\\pi k)$ for any integer $k$, the sequence $x[n]$ is indistinguishable from a sequence generated from a frequency $\\omega' = \\omega + 2\\pi k$. That is:\n$$\\cos((\\omega + 2\\pi k)n + \\phi) = \\cos(\\omega n + 2\\pi k n + \\phi) = \\cos(\\omega n + \\phi)$$\nsince $k$ and $n$ are both integers.\n\nThis means that a continuous-time frequency $f$ is indistinguishable from any frequency $f' = f + k f_s$ after being sampled at rate $f_s$. The range of unique frequencies for a discrete-time signal is $[-\\pi, \\pi]$, which corresponds to the continuous-time frequency range $[-f_s/2, f_s/2]$. This range is known as the baseband. Any frequency component of the original signal outside this baseband is \"folded\" or \"aliased\" into it.\n\nThe Shannon-Nyquist criterion states that to avoid this ambiguity, the sampling rate $f_s$ must be greater than twice the maximum frequency present in the signal, $f_{max}$. That is, $f_s > 2 f_{max}$. This condition ensures that the entire signal spectrum lies within the baseband $[-f_s/2, f_s/2]$.\n\nIf this condition is violated (insufficient sampling), specifically if we have a signal frequency $f$ such that $f > f_s/2$, then $f$ will be aliased to a lower frequency, $f_{alias}$, within the range $[0, f_s/2]$. The relationship is given by finding the integer $k$ that maps $f$ into the baseband: $f_{alias} = |f - k f_s|$.\n\nFor the case where $f_s/2 < f < f_s$, the appropriate choice is $k=1$. The aliased frequency is:\n$$f_{alias} = |f - f_s| = f_s - f$$\nSince we assumed $f > f_s/2$, it follows that $f_{alias} = f_s - f < f_s - f_s/2 = f_s/2$. This demonstrates that the apparent frequency $f_{alias}$ is not only within the baseband but also strictly lower than the original frequency $f$.\n\nFor a sleep spindle at $f = 14 \\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, if an EEG system were to use an insufficient sampling rate—for example, $f_s = 20 \\,\\mathrm{Hz}$—the Nyquist frequency is $f_s/2 = 10 \\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. Since $f = 14 \\,\\mathrm{Hz} > 10 \\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, the signal would be aliased. The apparent frequency in the sampled data would be $f_{alias} = f_s - f = 20 - 14 = 6 \\,\\mathrm{Hz}$. An algorithm designed to detect power in the spindle band ($11$–$16 \\,\\mathrm{Hz}$) would therefore fail to identify the event, as its energy would have been artifactually shifted to the delta/theta band ($0.5$–$7 \\,\\mathrm{Hz}$). This distorts the analysis, leading to a failure to detect true spindles and a mischaracterization of the sleep EEG.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of Minimum Sampling Rate\n\nThe Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem provides the basis for this calculation. To faithfully represent a signal without aliasing, the sampling rate $f_s$ must be at least twice the highest frequency component present in the signal, $f_{max}$. This minimum rate is the Nyquist rate, $f_{s,min}$.\n$$f_{s,min} = 2 f_{max}$$\nThe problem specifies that we are considering a prototype sleep spindle at $14 \\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ and that we should assume the signal is effectively bandlimited near this frequency. Therefore, the maximum frequency component we must preserve is $f_{max} = 14 \\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nSubstituting this value into the formula for the minimum sampling rate:\n$$f_{s,min} = 2 \\times 14 \\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\n$$f_{s,min} = 28 \\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\nIn practice, sampling rates are chosen with a margin above the Nyquist rate, but the theoretical minimum as defined by the criterion is exactly twice the maximum frequency. The problem requests the exact integer value for this theoretical minimum.\n\nThus, the minimum sampling rate required to faithfully represent $14 \\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ spindles without aliasing is $28 \\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{28} $$", "id": "4759466"}, {"introduction": "Once a high-fidelity electroencephalogram (EEG) is recorded, the next step is to translate the complex raw data into a clinically meaningful summary of sleep architecture.

It is based on standard clinical and neurophysiological principles of sleep medicine. All necessary data and definitions are provided for a unique solution.\n\nThe first step is to compute the total sleep time (TST) based on the provided epoch counts. The problem states that wake epochs do not contribute to total sleep time. TST is therefore the sum of all epochs corresponding to sleep stages N1, N2, N3, and REM.

The fraction for a given stage is the number of epochs for that stage divided by the total number of sleep epochs.\n\n- Stage N1 proportion:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{N1}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{N1}}}{N_{\\mathrm{TST}}} = \\frac{120}{840} = \\frac{1}{7} \\approx 0.142857...$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $p_{\\mathrm{N1}} = 0.1429$.\n\n- Stage N2 proportion:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{N2}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{N2}}}{N_{\\mathrm{TST}}} = \\frac{480}{840} = \\frac{4}{7} \\approx 0.571428...$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $p_{\\mathrm{N2}} = 0.5714$.\n\n- Stage N3 proportion:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{N3}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{N3}}}{N_{\\mathrm{TST}}} = \\frac{140}{840} = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.166666...$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $p_{\\mathrm{N3}} = 0.1667$.\n\n- Stage REM proportion:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{REM}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{REM}}}{N_{\\mathrm{TST}}} = \\frac{100}{840} = \\frac{5}{42} \\approx 0.119047...$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $p_{\\mathrm{REM}} = 0.1190$.\n\nThe problem asks for a discussion of the physiological meaning of any deviations. We compare the observed proportions $\\{p_i\\}$ with the age-adjusted normative proportions $\\{p_i^*\\}$:\n- N1: $p_{\\mathrm{N1}} \\approx 0.143$ vs. $p^{*}_{\\mathrm{N1}} = 0.05$. The patient spent nearly three times the normal proportion of time in N1 sleep. N1 is the lightest stage of sleep, representing the transition to sleep. A high percentage of N1, coupled with the significant Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO) of $n_{\\mathrm{W}} = 120$ epochs ($60$ minutes), is a strong indicator of sleep fragmentation and poor sleep continuity.\n- N2: $p_{\\mathrm{N2}} \\approx 0.571$ vs. $p^{*}_{\\mathrm{N2}} = 0.50$. N2 sleep is slightly elevated. N2 is the predominant sleep stage, and an increase can occur to compensate for the reduction in deeper sleep stages, reflecting a state of lighter, more easily disrupted sleep.\n- N3: $p_{\\mathrm{N3}} \\approx 0.167$ vs. $p^{*}_{\\mathrm{N3}} = 0.20$. There is a notable reduction in N3 sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep. From an EEG perspective, this means less time exhibiting the characteristic high-amplitude, low-frequency delta waves. N3 sleep is critical for physical restoration, growth hormone release, and declarative memory consolidation. Its reduction points to non-restorative sleep and is a common finding in sleep disorders such as insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea.\n- REM: $p_{\\mathrm{REM}} \\approx 0.119$ vs. $p^{*}_{\\mathrm{REM}} = 0.25$. The proportion of REM sleep is severely reduced, at less than half the normative value. REM sleep, characterized by a low-voltage, mixed-frequency EEG similar to wakefulness but with muscle atonia and rapid eye movements, is fundamental for emotional regulation and consolidation of procedural memory. A profound reduction in REM sleep is a significant clinical finding, often caused by frequent arousals that interrupt sleep cycles before REM can be fully expressed.\n\nIn summary, the patient's sleep architecture is highly abnormal. Despite a quantitatively normal Total Sleep Time of $7$ hours, the quality is exceptionally poor, characterized by fragmented sleep (high WASO and N1) and significant deficits in the most restorative stages of sleep (N3 and REM). This pattern suggests that the neurobiological mechanisms for sleep maintenance are failing, and arousal systems are pathologically overactive during the sleep period.\n\nNow, we compute the composite deviation index $D$. We use the exact fractional values of $p_i$ for precision.\nThe differences ($p_i - p_i^*$) are:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{N1}} - p^{*}_{\\mathrm{N1}} = \\frac{1}{7} - 0.05 = \\frac{1}{7} - \\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{20 - 7}{140} = \\frac{13}{140}$$\n$$p_{\\mathrm{N2}} - p^{*}_{\\mathrm{N2}} = \\frac{4}{7} - 0.50 = \\frac{4}{7} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{8 - 7}{14} = \\frac{1}{14}$$\n$$p_{\\mathrm{N3}} - p^{*}_{\\mathrm{N3}} = \\frac{1}{6} - 0.20 = \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{5 - 6}{30} = -\\frac{1}{30}$$\n$$p_{\\mathrm{REM}} - p^{*}_{\\mathrm{REM}} = \\frac{5}{42} - 0.25 = \\frac{5}{42} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{10 - 21}{84} = -\\frac{11}{84}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the sum of the squares of these differences:\n$$\\sum_{i} (p_{i} - p^{*}_{i})^{2} = \\left(\\frac{13}{140}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{1}{14}\\right)^{2} + \\left(-\\frac{1}{30}\\right)^{2} + \\left(-\\frac{11}{84}\\right)^{2}$$\n$$\\sum_{i} (p_{i} - p^{*}_{i})^{2} = \\frac{169}{19600} + \\frac{1}{196} + \\frac{1}{900} + \\frac{121}{7056}$$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $176400$.\n$$\\sum_{i} (p_{i} - p^{*}_{i})^{2} = \\frac{169 \\times 9}{176400} + \\frac{1 \\times 900}{176400} + \\frac{1 \\times 196}{176400} + \\frac{121 \\times 25}{176400}$$\n$$\\sum_{i} (p_{i} - p^{*}_{i})^{2} = \\frac{1521 + 900 + 196 + 3025}{176400} = \\frac{5642}{176400}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the deviation index $D$:\n$$D = 100 \\times \\sqrt{\\sum_{i} \\left(p_{i} - p^{*}_{i}\\right)^{2}} = 100 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{5642}{176400}}$$\n$$D = 100 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{5642}}{\\sqrt{176400}} = 100 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{5642}}{420} = \\frac{5}{21}\\sqrt{5642}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$D \\approx \\frac{5}{21} \\times 75.113248 \\approx 17.8841066$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the deviation index $D$ is $17.88$.

This final practice bridges the gap between fundamental theory and therapeutic application by focusing on a common circadian rhythm disorder. Using the concept of the Phase Response Curve (PRC) for melatonin, you will engage in a practical design problem [@problem_id:4759419]: calculating a precise, evidence-based dosing schedule to shift a patient's internal biological clock, demonstrating how mathematical models of circadian physiology can guide personalized medicine.", "problem": "A patient meets criteria for delayed sleep–wake phase disorder (DSWPD) and has a salivary dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) at local clock time $23{:}30$ measured under standard dim-light conditions. You will design an initial phase-advancing intervention over one week using evening light avoidance and low-dose exogenous melatonin. Use the following well-tested facts as the fundamental base for your derivation.\n\n1. DLMO is a validated biomarker of endogenous circadian phase. For exogenous melatonin, the phase response curve (PRC) shows a phase-advance zone in the late afternoon and early evening, with a peak advance when dosing occurs approximately $5$ hours before DLMO. The advance effect diminishes toward the edges of the advance zone.\n\n2. Over a short interval of days with a fixed schedule, daily phase shifts from timed melatonin sum approximately linearly to yield the weekly shift, provided the timing remains referenced to the endogenous DLMO.\n\n3. To prevent phase delays from evening light, bright light after DLMO should be avoided; therefore, a light-avoidance plan begins at or before DLMO and continues through habitual bedtime. For the purposes of this calculation, you may assume that initiating light avoidance at DLMO is sufficient to prevent light-induced delays.\n\nTo make the problem determinate, adopt the standard quadratic approximation to the local shape of the melatonin PRC in the advance zone: the daily phase advance in hours, $a(x)$, as a function of timing $x$ (defined as hours before DLMO, with $x>0$ meaning before DLMO), is modeled as a concave parabola with its maximum at $x=5$. Specifically, assume that $a(5)=0.40$ (that is, a maximal daily advance of $0.40$ hours when dosing $5$ hours before DLMO), and that the advance effect falls to $0$ at the edges $x=1$ and $x=9$. Assume symmetry of the parabola about $x=5$.\n\nYour target is a net circadian phase advance of $2$ hours after $7$ consecutive days. Compute the initial fixed melatonin dosing time on day $1$ as a clock time referenced to local midnight by the following steps: derive $a(x)$ from the assumptions above, set the required daily advance as the ratio of the weekly target to the number of days, solve for the dosing lead $x$ (choose the solution corresponding to a late-afternoon/early-evening dose), and then convert this lead relative to the DLMO at $23{:}30$ to a clock time.
