This exercise focuses on the critical skill of titrating the prescribed Time in Bed ($TIB$) based on weekly Sleep Efficiency ($SE$), the primary metric of sleep consolidation.

The weekly titration of prescribed time in bed is based on the consolidation of sleep as measured by Sleep Efficiency (SE), where by definition $SE = \\frac{\\text{total sleep time (TST)}}{\\text{time in bed (TIB)}}$. The control goal is to produce a negative feedback adjustment of $\\text{TIB}$ to stabilize $SE$ within a high-efficiency band while avoiding oscillations and preserving safety.

The problem specifies that the rule must (i) increase $\\text{TIB}$ for high Sleep Efficiency ($\\text{SE}$), (ii) decrease $\\text{TIB}$ for low $\\text{SE}$, and (iii) hold $\\text{TIB}$ otherwise. This structure is intended to stabilize $\\text{SE}$ in a high-efficiency band.\n\nStandard clinical protocols for sleep restriction therapy define specific thresholds for \"high\" and \"low\" $\\text{SE}$. Grounded in established clinical practice, we will define a \"low\" threshold $SE_{low}$ and a \"high\" threshold $SE_{high}$. A common and effective choice for these thresholds, which creates the desired three-zone control system, is $SE_{low} = 0.85$ ($85\\%$) and $SE_{high} = 0.90$ ($90\\%$). Sleep efficiency below $85\\%$ indicates a need for sleep consolidation (less time in bed), while sleep efficiency at or above $90\\%$ suggests the patient can tolerate an expanded sleep window (more time in bed). The range between these values is the target stabilization band.\n\nLet $\\text{TIB}_{i}$ and $\\text{TST}_{i}$ be the time in bed and total sleep time for week $i$, respectively. The sleep efficiency for week $i$ is $SE_{i} = \\frac{\\text{TST}_{i}}{\\text{TIB}_{i}}$. The prescribed time in bed for the next week, $\\text{TIB}_{i+1}$, is determined based on $SE_{i}$. The fixed step size for adjustment is given as $\\Delta = 15$ minutes.\n\nThe derived three-zone decision rule is as follows:\n1.  If $SE_{i} \\ge 0.90$, then the tentative next week's time in bed is $\\text{TIB}_{i+1}' = \\text{TIB}_{i} + \\Delta$.\n2.

Temporarily suspend sleep restriction and expand time in bed by $30$–$60$ minutes, enforce no driving until sleepiness resolves, and perform urgent suicide and mania risk evaluation, coordinating with the pharmacotherapy prescriber.**\n- **Suspend/expand TIB**: The patient's severe sleepiness (ESS $16$, microsleeps, accident risk) demonstrates that the accumulation of homeostatic sleep drive (Process $S$) is excessive. According to the provided principles, the sleep restriction is too aggressive. Expanding the time in bed ($TIB$) is the correct immediate action to reduce sleep debt, decrease dangerous somnolence, and mitigate a primary trigger for the mood episode.\n- **Enforce no driving**: This is a critical and immediate protective measure to prevent a potentially fatal accident, directly addressing the datum of a \"near-miss motor vehicle incident\" and the principle that \"excessive daytime sleepiness increases accident risk.\"\n- **Urgent suicide and mania risk evaluation**: The emergence of suicidal ideation and manic symptoms constitutes a psychiatric emergency. The principles state \"emerging suicidality requires immediate safety planning\" and \"sleep loss can precipitate hypomania or mania.\" An urgent evaluation is the standard of care.\n- **Coordinate with prescriber**: Bipolar disorder is managed pharmacologically. The prescriber of the patient's mood stabilizers must be alerted to the mood destabilization to consider medication adjustments.\n- **Verdict**: This option comprehensively addresses all acute safety concerns in a clinically appropriate manner. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Continue sleep restriction unchanged but add a $30$ minute afternoon nap to reduce sleepiness.**\n- **Continue sleep restriction unchanged**: This is the most dangerous part of this option. The sleep restriction is the likely driver of both the profound sleepiness and the mood destabilization. Continuing it would be expected to worsen the crisis.\n- **Add a nap**: A short nap might provide transient relief from sleepiness, but it is an insufficient countermeasure for the severe sleep debt induced by a $6$-hour sleep window, and it fails to address the mood destabilization.

The foundational principles explicitly warn that \"indiscriminate bright-light exposure can ... exacerbate ... mood destabilization.\" Given the patient is already exhibiting new manic symptoms, introducing a potent, potentially mood-destabilizing intervention is contraindicated and dangerous.\n- **Verdict**: This action poses an unacceptable risk of worsening the patient's manic episode. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Screen for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with expedited diagnostic testing before resuming restriction; consider interim use of a fixed earlier bedtime with the same fixed wake time to increase $TIB$ and improve safety while evaluation proceeds.**\n- **Screen for OSA**: The principle \"obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can be unmasked or worsened by sleep restriction\" makes this a highly relevant consideration. The patient's extreme sleepiness (ESS $16$) is disproportionate and warrants investigation for comorbid sleep disorders like OSA.\n- **Increase TIB**: The interim plan to \"increase $TIB$\" by moving the bedtime earlier while keeping the wake time fixed is a specific, safe, and appropriate way to suspend the aggressive sleep restriction. This action directly addresses the excessive sleepiness and reduces the pressure on mood stability, aligning with the necessary action identified in option A.\n- **Verdict**: This option combines a prudent diagnostic consideration with an immediate, appropriate protective action (increasing $TIB$). It represents a valid and safe component of the immediate management plan. **Correct**.\n\n**E. Instruct the patient to increase evening caffeine intake to maintain wakefulness and preserve the sleep window; provide reassurance that mood symptoms will normalize as sleep consolidates.**\n- **Increase evening caffeine**: This is directly contrary to a foundational principle provided: \"evening caffeine ... can exacerbate insomnia.\" Caffeine is a stimulant that would disrupt sleep architecture and worsen sleep quality, undermining the goal of sleep consolidation. It can also increase anxiety and agitation, further fueling a manic state.\n- **Provide reassurance**: To offer simple reassurance in the face of emerging suicidality and mania is clinically negligent. These are psychiatric emergencies requiring active intervention, not passive reassurance.\n- **Verdict**: This option is iatrogenic, counter-therapeutic, and dangerous. **Incorrect**.\n\n**F.

The principle \"emerging suicidality requires immediate safety planning\" makes these actions non-negotiable.\n- **Written safety plan, crisis resources, means restriction, increased monitoring**: These are all evidence-based, standard-of-care interventions for a patient with new suicidal ideation. They are immediate and protective actions.\n- **Verdict**: This option is an essential and mandatory response to the patient's reported suicidal ideation. **Correct**.\n\nOptions A, D, and F all describe appropriate and necessary immediate protective actions.
