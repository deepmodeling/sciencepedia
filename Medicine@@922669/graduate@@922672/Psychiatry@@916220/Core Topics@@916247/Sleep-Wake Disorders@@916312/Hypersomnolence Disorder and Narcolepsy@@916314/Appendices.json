This hands-on practice transitions to the clinical challenge of dosing sodium oxybate, a primary treatment for narcolepsy, in a pediatric patient with hepatic impairment.

Round your answer to four significant figures. Only the calculated dosing volume should be submitted as the final numeric answer.", "solution": "### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core principle is that the systemic exposure at steady state ($AUC_{ss}$) should remain constant between a typical patient and the patient with hepatic impairment. The intended exposure is that which would be achieved with a typical dose ($D_{typ}$) in a patient with typical clearance ($CL_{typ}$). The goal is to find the adjusted dose ($D_{adj}$) for the patient with adjusted clearance ($CL_{adj}$) that yields the same exposure.\n\nThe proportionality is given as:\n$$ AUC_{ss} = k \\frac{D}{CL} $$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nTo maintain the same exposure, we set $AUC_{ss, adj} = AUC_{ss, typ}$:\n$$ k \\frac{D_{adj}}{CL_{adj}} = k \\frac{D_{typ}}{CL_{typ}} $$\n\nThe constant $k$ cancels, yielding the relationship:\n$$ \\frac{D_{adj}}{CL_{adj}} = \\frac{D_{typ}}{CL_{typ}} $$\n\nWe are given that the patient's clearance is reduced to $75\\%$ of typical, so $CL_{adj} = 0.75 \\times CL_{typ}$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{D_{adj}}{0.75 \\times CL_{typ}} = \\frac{D_{typ}}{CL_{typ}} $$\n\nSolving for the adjusted dose, $D_{adj}$:\n$$ D_{adj} = 0.75 \\times D_{typ} $$\nThis confirms the expected outcome: to maintain constant exposure when clearance is reduced by a certain factor, the dose must be reduced by the same factor.\n\nFirst, calculate the typical per-dose mass, $D_{typ}$, based on the patient's weight:\n$$ D_{typ} = (\\text{Dosing rate}) \\times (\\text{Body weight}) $$\n$$ D_{typ} = 0.075\\,\\mathrm{g/kg} \\times 34.6\\,\\mathrm{kg} = 2.595\\,\\mathrm{g} $$\n\nNext, calculate the adjusted per-dose mass, $D_{adj}$, for the patient with hepatic impairment:\n$$ D_{adj} = 0.75 \\times D_{typ} = 0.75 \\times 2.595\\,\\mathrm{g} = 1.94625\\,\\mathrm{g} $$\n\nFinally, calculate the volume ($V$) of the oral solution needed to deliver this adjusted dose. The concentration ($C$) of the solution is given as $0.5\\,\\mathrm{g/mL}$. The relationship between mass, concentration, and volume is $D = C \\times V$. Therefore:\n$$ V = \\frac{D_{adj}}{C} $$\n$$ V = \\frac{1.94625\\,\\mathrm{g}}{0.5\\,\\mathrm{g/mL}} = 3.8925\\,\\mathrm{mL} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ V \\approx 3.893\\,\\mathrm{mL} $$\n\n### Assessment of Safety Monitoring Needs\n\nThe problem also requests a reasoned assessment of safety monitoring needs. This is a critical component of applying the calculated dose in a clinical setting.\n\n1.  **Respiratory Safety**: Sodium oxybate is a potent central nervous system (CNS) depressant with a black box warning for profound sedation and clinically significant respiratory depression. Its mechanism of action via GABA-B and GHB receptors can suppress the central respiratory drive. This risk is highest at treatment initiation and during dose titration. In a pediatric patient, this is of paramount concern.\n    - **Monitoring**: A baseline sleep study (polysomnography) is strongly recommended to screen for underlying sleep-disordered breathing (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea), which would substantially increase the risk of respiratory compromise. Caregivers must be rigorously educated on recognizing signs of respiratory distress, such as slow, shallow, or labored breathing, and on the emergency response plan. Pulse oximetry monitoring at home during the initial titration phase may be considered.\n\n2.  **Central Nervous System Depressant Interactions**: The sedative effects of sodium oxybate are additive, and potentially synergistic, with other CNS depressants, including alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, and sedative-hypnotics. Concurrent use can lead to life-threatening respiratory depression, coma, and death.\n    - **Monitoring**: A comprehensive review of all concomitant medications is mandatory before initiation. All other CNS depressants are strictly contraindicated. Caregivers and the patient (as age-appropriate) must be educated on the absolute prohibition of alcohol and other sedating substances. This education should be reinforced at every follow-up visit.\n\n3.  **Sodium Load Considerations**: Sodium oxybate contains a significant amount of sodium. The molecular weight of sodium oxybate ($C_4H_7NaO_3$) is approximately $126.09\\,\\mathrm{g/mol}$, while that of sodium is $22.99\\,\\mathrm{g/mol}$. The sodium content is approximately $18.2\\%$ by mass. The proposed total daily dose is $2 \\times 1.94625\\,\\mathrm{g} = 3.8925\\,\\mathrm{g}$ of sodium oxybate, which contains approximately $3.8925\\,\\mathrm{g} \\times 0.182 = 0.71\\,\\mathrm{g}$ of elemental sodium. This represents a substantial portion of the recommended daily sodium intake for a child.\n    - **Monitoring**: Baseline and periodic monitoring of blood pressure is essential. Dietary sodium counseling should be provided to ensure the total daily sodium intake remains within safe limits. In patients with or at risk for hypertension, heart failure, or renal impairment, this sodium load requires careful management and surveillance for signs of fluid retention (e.g., edema, weight gain).\n\n4.  **Hepatic Function Surveillance**: The dose has been proactively adjusted for pre-existing moderate hepatic impairment. However, the liver is the primary organ for the metabolism of sodium oxybate. The accuracy of the $75\\%$ clearance estimate and the stability of the patient's liver function are not guaranteed.\n    - **Monitoring**: Baseline liver function tests (LFTs), including AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and albumin, are required. These tests should be repeated periodically throughout treatment, particularly during dose titration and if any clinical signs of worsening hepatic function or drug toxicity (e.g., excessive sedation) appear. Any significant change in LFTs or clinical status may necessitate a re-evaluation of the dose or discontinuation of the therapy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.893}$$", "id": "4719643"}]}
