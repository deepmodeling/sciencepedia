We are given the prior probability of a diagnosis, Gender Dysphoria (GD), and the sensitivity and specificity of three clinical features. We must update the prior probability in light of the observation that all three features are present.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the given information.\nLet $\\mathrm{GD}$ be the event that the patient has Gender Dysphoria, and $\\mathrm{BDD}$ be the event that the patient has Body Dysmorphic Disorder. The problem states these are the only two possibilities, so they are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events in this context.\nThe prior probability of GD is given as:\n$$P(\\mathrm{GD}) = 0.30$$\nTherefore, the prior probability of BDD is:\n$$P(\\mathrm{BDD}) = 1 - P(\\mathrm{GD}) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$$\n\nLet $F_1$, $F_2$, and $F_3$ be the events that the three clinical features are present. The problem states that all three features are observed. We are tasked with finding the posterior probability $P(\\mathrm{GD} \\mid F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3)$.\n\nFor each feature $F_i$, we are given its sensitivity for GD ($Se_i$) and specificity for BDD ($Sp_i$). It is critical to precisely define these terms. Standard medical diagnostics defines sensitivity and specificity relative to a single target condition. Here, the target condition is GD.\nLet us denote GD as the \"positive\" condition ($D+$) and BDD as the \"negative\" condition ($D-$). A feature being present is a \"positive\" test result ($T+$).\nSensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given the positive condition:\n$$Se_i = P(F_i \\mid \\mathrm{GD})$$\nSpecificity is the probability of a negative test result given the negative condition. A negative test result corresponds to the feature being absent ($\\neg F_i$).\n$$Sp_i = P(\\neg F_i \\mid \\mathrm{BDD})$$\nThe problem's phrasing \"specificity $Sp$ for BDD\" is interpreted in this standard framework, meaning the specificity of the test for GD, which is measured on the BDD cohort.\n\nWith these definitions, we can list the provided values:\nFor feature 1: $Se_1 = 0.65$ and $Sp_1 = 0.90$.\nFor feature 2: $Se_2 = 0.70$ and $Sp_2 = 0.60$.\nFor feature 3: $Se_3 = 0.20$ and $Sp_3 = 0.25$.\n\nWe will use the odds form of Bayes' theorem. The prior odds in favor of GD are:\n$$\\text{Odds}(\\mathrm{GD}) = \\frac{P(\\mathrm{GD})}{P(\\mathrm{BDD})} = \\frac{0.30}{0.70} = \\frac{3}{7}$$\n\nThe posterior odds are found by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio (LR) for the observed evidence. The evidence is that all three features are present ($F_1, F_2, F_3$).\nThe likelihood ratio for a single present feature ($F_i$) is the positive likelihood ratio, $LR_{i,+}$:\n$$LR_{i,+} = \\frac{P(F_i \\mid \\mathrm{GD})}{P(F_i \\mid \\mathrm{BDD})}$$\nThe numerator is the sensitivity, $Se_i$. The denominator, $P(F_i \\mid \\mathrm{BDD})$, is the probability of a false positive, which relates to specificity as $P(F_i \\mid \\mathrm{BDD}) = 1 - P(\\neg F_i \\mid \\mathrm{BDD}) = 1 - Sp_i$.\nTherefore, the likelihood ratio for each present feature is:\n$$LR_{i,+} = \\frac{Se_i}{1 - Sp_i}$$\n\nLet's calculate the likelihood ratio for each of the three features:\nFor feature 1:\n$$LR_{1,+} = \\frac{Se_1}{1 - Sp_1} = \\frac{0.65}{1 - 0.90} = \\frac{0.65}{0.10} = 6.5$$\nFor feature 2:\n$$LR_{2,+} = \\frac{Se_2}{1 - Sp_2} = \\frac{0.70}{1 - 0.60} = \\frac{0.70}{0.40} = 1.75$$\nFor feature 3:\n$$LR_{3,+} = \\frac{Se_3}{1 - Sp_3} = \\frac{0.20}{1 - 0.25} = \\frac{0.20}{0.75} = \\frac{20}{75} = \\frac{4}{15}$$\n\nThe problem states to assume conditional independence of the features given the diagnosis. This assumption allows us to find the total likelihood ratio for the combined evidence ($F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3$) by multiplying the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$LR_{\\text{total}} = LR_{1,+} \\times LR_{2,+} \\times LR_{3,+}$$\n$$LR_{\\text{total}} = 6.5 \\times 1.75 \\times \\frac{4}{15}$$\nTo maintain precision, we work with fractions:\n$$LR_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{13}{2} \\times \\frac{7}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{15} = \\frac{13 \\times 7 \\times 4}{2 \\times 4 \\times 15} = \\frac{13 \\times 7}{2 \\times 15} = \\frac{91}{30}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the posterior odds in favor of GD:\n$$\\text{Odds}(\\mathrm{GD} \\mid F_1, F_2, F_3) = \\text{Odds}(\\mathrm{GD}) \\times LR_{\\text{total}}$$\n$$\\text{Odds}(\\mathrm{GD} \\mid F_1, F_2, F_3) = \\frac{3}{7} \\times \\frac{91}{30}$$\nSince $91 = 7 \\times 13$ and $30 = 3 \\times 10$:\n$$\\text{Odds}(\\mathrm{GD} \\mid F_1, F_2, F_3) = \\frac{3}{7} \\times \\frac{7 \\times 13}{3 \\times 10} = \\frac{13}{10} = 1.3$$\n\nFinally, we convert the posterior odds back to a probability.
