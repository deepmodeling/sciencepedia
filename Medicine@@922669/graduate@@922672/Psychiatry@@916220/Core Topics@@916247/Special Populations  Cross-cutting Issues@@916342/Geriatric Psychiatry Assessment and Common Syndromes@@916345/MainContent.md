## Introduction
The practice of geriatric psychiatry addresses the unique and complex mental health challenges faced by older adults, an area where medical, psychological, and social factors are inextricably linked. Standard diagnostic approaches often fall short, failing to capture the multifaceted nature of presentations where functional decline is the common language of distress. This article bridges that gap by providing a comprehensive framework for assessment and management. In the first chapter, "Principles and Mechanisms," we will delve into the cornerstone of geriatric evaluation—the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA)—and explore the core mechanisms differentiating normal aging from neurocognitive disorders like delirium and dementia. The second chapter, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," translates these principles into practice, demonstrating how to conduct a diagnostic workup, tailor therapeutic interventions, and address complex community safety issues. Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" section will offer opportunities to apply this knowledge to realistic clinical challenges, solidifying the skills needed for effective and compassionate care.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### The Foundation: Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment

The practice of geriatric psychiatry rests upon the foundational principle that older adults often present with complex, interacting problems that defy a simple, single-diagnosis approach. Medical, psychological, and social factors are deeply intertwined, and functional decline is frequently the final common pathway through which distress and disease manifest. Consequently, a systematic and holistic evaluation is not merely an adjunct but the cornerstone of effective care. This process is formalized as the **Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA)**.

The CGA is a multidimensional, often interdisciplinary, diagnostic and therapeutic process that aims to determine an older person’s medical, functional, psychological, and social capabilities and limitations. Its purpose is to generate an integrated, person-centered plan for treatment and follow-up. The core domains of the CGA systematically organize the vast amount of information required to understand the older patient [@problem_id:4716275]. These domains include:

*   **Medical and Physical Status:** This involves a thorough review of all comorbidities, a meticulous medication reconciliation with a focus on **polypharmacy** and high-risk drugs (e.g., those with a high **anticholinergic burden**), and an assessment of nutritional status, pain, and sensory functions such as vision and hearing.

*   **Functional Status:** This domain evaluates an individual’s ability to perform tasks necessary for self-care and independent living. It encompasses mobility, balance, and risk of falls.

*   **Cognitive Status:** This includes screening for and characterizing deficits in cognition. It is crucial to assess for both chronic, progressive conditions like dementia and acute, fluctuating disturbances like delirium, with specific attention to domains such as memory, attention, and executive function.

*   **Affective Status:** This domain focuses on the patient’s emotional well-being, screening for and diagnosing mood syndromes (e.g., depression, apathy), anxiety disorders, and assessing psychological states like grief and adjustment.

*   **Social and Environmental Context:** This evaluates the patient's living situation, the strength and capacity of their support system (family, caregivers), financial resources, and access to care. It also includes an assessment of the physical environment for safety (e.g., lighting, grab bars, fall hazards) and accessibility.

The true power of the CGA lies in the synthesis of these domains. A common and effective framework for this integration is the **biopsychosocial formulation**, often structured using the "4 Ps": **Predisposing** factors (long-standing vulnerabilities), **Precipitating** factors (acute triggers), **Perpetuating** factors (elements that maintain the problem), and **Protective** factors (strengths and resources). For instance, consider an 82-year-old woman presenting with new-onset confusion after a hospitalization for pneumonia. A CGA would reveal that her age, underlying mild cognitive impairment, and hearing loss are predisposing factors. The acute infection and hospitalization are precipitating events. Perpetuating factors might include the use of anticholinergic medications, a cluttered and poorly lit home environment, and social withdrawal due to bereavement. Her engaged daughter and stated desire for autonomy are protective factors. This integrated view allows the clinician to move beyond a simple diagnostic label and develop a prioritized, modifiable problem list—addressing everything from medication management to home safety—that respects the patient's values and goals [@problem_id:4716275].

### Core Assessment Domains in Detail

#### Functional Assessment: Distinguishing Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs)

Functional status is a critical indicator of an older adult's health and well-being. It is broadly categorized into two types of activities, the distinction between which is of paramount diagnostic importance.

**Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)**, also known as basic ADLs, are the fundamental tasks required for self-care. These include bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring (e.g., moving from a bed to a chair), continence, and feeding. From a neurocognitive perspective, ADLs are largely dependent on **[procedural memory](@entry_id:153564)**—they are overlearned motor routines that require relatively low executive control. For most of an individual's life, these actions are performed automatically, relying on well-established [neural circuits](@entry_id:163225) in the motor cortex, basal ganglia, and [cerebellum](@entry_id:151221) [@problem_id:4716287].

**Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs)** are more complex tasks that are necessary for independent living within a community. Examples include managing finances, handling transportation, shopping, preparing meals, using the telephone, and managing medications. Unlike ADLs, IADLs are heavily dependent on higher-order cognitive functions. For example, managing finances requires planning, calculation, and organization (executive functions), while managing medications requires remembering to take them at the right time (prospective memory) and understanding their purpose (semantic memory). These tasks are critically reliant on brain networks that are often vulnerable early in the course of neurodegenerative diseases, such as the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobes [@problem_id:4716287].

This distinction explains a cardinal observation in geriatric medicine: in most [neurodegenerative diseases](@entry_id:151227) like Alzheimer’s, **decline in IADLs typically precedes decline in ADLs**. A retired accountant who begins to have trouble reconciling his bank statements or organizing his medications, while remaining fully independent in dressing and bathing, is demonstrating a classic early sign of a neurocognitive disorder. His difficulties are not due to motor weakness but to the erosion of the executive and memory functions that underpin these complex tasks. The more automatic, procedural skills required for ADLs are subserved by brain regions that are typically affected much later in the disease process.

#### Cognitive Assessment: Differentiating Normal Aging from Neurocognitive Disorders

Concerns about memory are ubiquitous in older adults, making it essential to differentiate benign, age-related changes from the harbingers of a pathological neurodegenerative process. This distinction rests on understanding the different memory systems and how they are affected by aging versus disease.

**Normal cognitive aging** is characterized by a predictable pattern of changes. **Processing speed** typically declines, meaning it takes longer to perform mental tasks. In the realm of [episodic memory](@entry_id:173757), the primary difficulty lies with **retrieval**. The information has been successfully learned and stored (**consolidation** is relatively preserved), but accessing it can be slow or effortful. This is the "tip-of-the-tongue" phenomenon. A key feature of this retrieval deficit is that [memory performance](@entry_id:751876) improves significantly with cues or hints. For example, an older adult might not be able to freely recall a list of words but will remember them when given category cues (e.g., "Was there a fruit on the list?") or when asked to pick them out from a larger list (**recognition**) [@problem_id:4716229]. Functionally, these changes do not interfere with independence in daily life.

**Pathological [neurodegeneration](@entry_id:168368)**, as seen in amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) or early Alzheimer's disease, presents a starkly different profile. The core deficit is a failure of **consolidation**, due to dysfunction in medial temporal lobe structures like the hippocampus. New information is not effectively stored, leading to **rapid forgetting**. Unlike in normal aging, cues or hints provide little to no benefit because the memory trace itself is weak or absent. Recognition performance is often poor and may be contaminated by false positives (i.e., "recognizing" items that were never presented). This pattern of a primary storage deficit, combined with new-onset difficulties performing complex IADLs, signals a departure from normal aging and meets criteria for a **Neurocognitive Disorder** as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [@problem_id:4716229].

#### Ethical Assessment: Decision-Making Capacity

A fundamental component of geriatric assessment, particularly when a patient's choices conflict with medical recommendations, is the evaluation of **decision-making capacity**. It is crucial to distinguish this clinical concept from the legal concept of **competence**.

**Decision-making capacity** is a clinical determination of a patient's ability to make a specific healthcare decision at a specific point in time. It is assessed by clinicians at the bedside. It is not a global trait; a patient may have the capacity to consent to a simple blood draw but lack the capacity to weigh the risks and benefits of a complex surgery. It can also fluctuate, for instance, in the context of delirium. The assessment of capacity is based on a functional evaluation of four core abilities [@problem_id:4716222]:

1.  **Understanding:** The ability to comprehend and paraphrase information about one's condition and the proposed treatment options.
2.  **Appreciation:** The ability to recognize that the information is relevant to one's own situation and to acknowledge the reality of one's condition.
3.  **Reasoning:** The ability to manipulate the information rationally, to weigh the risks and benefits of different options, and to arrive at a choice that is consistent with one's personal values and goals. This does not require perfect logic or statistical recall, but a coherent thought process.
4.  **Communication:** The ability to express a clear and consistent choice.

**Competence**, in contrast, is a legal status determined by a judge in a court of law. A declaration of incompetence is typically a global finding that a person is unable to manage their own affairs, resulting in the appointment of a legal guardian. While a clinician's assessment of incapacity is critical evidence in a competency hearing, the two are not synonymous. All adults are presumed competent until proven otherwise in court.

Consider an 82-year-old retired engineer with a mild neurocognitive disorder who refuses a recommended surgery, stating he values comfort over longevity. If he can explain the nature of his condition, the purpose of the surgery, the alternatives, and can articulate a rationale for his choice based on his personal values (e.g., fear of hospitalization), he likely possesses decision-making capacity for this specific choice, even if his recall of risk percentages is imprecise [@problem_id:4716222].

### Common Geriatric Syndromes: Mechanisms and Differentiation

#### The Acute Brain Failure: Delirium

Delirium is a medical emergency and one of the most common and serious syndromes encountered in geriatric medicine. It represents an acute failure of the brain's integrative functions.

According to the DSM-5, delirium is defined by a core disturbance in **attention** (reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention) and **awareness** (reduced orientation to the environment). This disturbance develops acutely (over hours to days), represents a change from baseline, and tends to **fluctuate** in severity throughout the day. There are also additional cognitive disturbances (e.g., in memory, orientation, or perception). A critical feature is that the syndrome is a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal, or toxin exposure [@problem_id:4716286].

This clinical profile allows delirium to be differentiated from other conditions. Unlike **dementia**, delirium's onset is acute, not insidious, and its course is fluctuating, not stable. While attention may be impaired in advanced dementia, it is the primary, acute, and fluctuating disturbance in delirium. Unlike **primary psychotic disorders**, delirium is characterized by a clouded sensorium and altered level of consciousness, whereas psychosis typically occurs in the context of a clear sensorium. Importantly, delirium can and often does occur superimposed on a pre-existing dementia. In such cases, the diagnosis is made by recognizing an acute and fluctuating worsening of attention and cognition above the patient's chronic baseline [@problem_id:4716286].

The mechanisms underlying delirium converge on disrupting large-scale brain networks critical for attention and arousal. The **cholinergic deficiency hypothesis** is a central theory, positing that a reduction in the brain's acetylcholine—a key neurotransmitter for attentional processing—is a final common pathway. This is powerfully illustrated by the delirious effects of anticholinergic drugs. A second key mechanism is **neuroinflammation**. Peripheral insults like infection, surgery, or injury trigger the release of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α). These molecules signal to the brain, activating microglia and triggering an inflammatory cascade that disrupts neurotransmission, including suppressing acetylcholine release and altering the balance of other systems like dopamine [@problem_id:4716255].

These factors are synergistic. In a vulnerable older patient with reduced cognitive reserve, a combination of insults—such as an anticholinergic medication (e.g., diphenhydramine) directly blocking acetylcholine receptors, a urinary tract infection driving [neuroinflammation](@entry_id:166850), and sleep deprivation further amplifying cytokine production and destabilizing arousal systems—can easily overwhelm the brain's [homeostatic mechanisms](@entry_id:141716) and precipitate an episode of delirium [@problem_id:4716255].

#### The Chronic Brain Failures: Major Neurocognitive Disorders (Dementias)

While delirium is an acute failure, dementias represent chronic, progressive brain failures. These syndromes are best understood as the clinical expression of disease processes that preferentially disrupt specific large-scale neural networks. The pattern of early cognitive and behavioral deficits provides crucial clues to the underlying pathology [@problem_id:4716274].

*   **Alzheimer’s Disease (AD):** As the most common cause of dementia, AD pathology typically begins in the medial temporal lobes. This disrupts the network responsible for memory encoding and consolidation. Consequently, the hallmark early feature of AD is a profound **[episodic memory](@entry_id:173757) impairment** with rapid forgetting. As the disease spreads to parietal regions, visuospatial difficulties, such as getting lost in familiar places, emerge.

*   **Vascular Dementia (VaD):** Caused by cerebrovascular disease (e.g., multiple strokes or small vessel ischemic changes), VaD often damages the frontal-subcortical circuits that mediate executive function. The classic presentation is therefore one of early **executive dysfunction** (problems with planning, organizing, [multitasking](@entry_id:752339)) and **psychomotor slowing**. The clinical course may be stepwise, with periods of abrupt decline corresponding to new vascular events, and focal neurological signs may be present.

*   **Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB):** In DLB, pathology affects brainstem, limbic, and cortical areas, particularly posterior [visual processing](@entry_id:150060) networks. This leads to a distinct clinical picture. Early cognitive deficits are often in **visuoperceptual and attentional/executive domains**, with [episodic memory](@entry_id:173757) being relatively spared initially. The hallmark features include **fluctuating cognition** with pronounced variations in attention and alertness, recurrent, well-formed **visual hallucinations**, motor symptoms of **parkinsonism**, and **REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD)**.

*   **Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD):** This group of disorders is caused by focal atrophy of the frontal and/or anterior temporal lobes. The presentation depends on the precise location of the atrophy. The **behavioral variant (bvFTD)**, linked to orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate dysfunction, is characterized by early and profound changes in personality and social conduct, such as **behavioral disinhibition**, **apathy**, and loss of empathy. In contrast, memory and visuospatial skills are often strikingly preserved in the early stages. Other forms of FTD present as **Primary Progressive Aphasia**, with a primary loss of language function.

#### Affective and Behavioral Syndromes

**Major Depression in Late Life:** Depression is not a normal part of aging and presents with specific features in older adults. It is defined by the presence of at least five depressive symptoms for at least two weeks, with one being depressed mood or anhedonia (loss of interest/pleasure). In the elderly, **neurovegetative symptoms** are often prominent, including early morning awakening, significant appetite and weight loss, and psychomotor slowing. Cognitive symptoms include poor concentration and negative thoughts of guilt, worthlessness, or hopelessness [@problem_id:4716296]. It is critical to differentiate depression from:
*   **Grief:** Characterized by waves of sadness related to loss, with self-esteem remaining intact and the capacity for positive emotion preserved between the pangs of grief.
*   **Adjustment Disorder:** A sub-syndromal emotional or behavioral reaction to an identifiable stressor, which does not meet full criteria for a major depressive episode.
*   **Apathy:** A syndrome of diminished motivation and goal-directed behavior that lacks the profound subjective sadness and negative cognitions of depression. The cognitive profile can also be a clue: depression often causes a retrieval-based memory deficit that improves with cueing, whereas the memory deficit in AD is an encoding failure that does not.

**Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD):** As dementia progresses, behavioral symptoms are nearly universal. These can include agitation, psychosis (hallucinations, delusions), apathy, depression, [disinhibition](@entry_id:164902), and sleep disturbances. A powerful framework for understanding these behaviors is the **Needs-Driven Dementia-Compromised Behavior (NDB) model**. This model posits that behaviors are often a communication of an unmet need (e.g., pain, hunger, thirst, boredom, need for toileting) by a person whose brain is too compromised to express that need in a conventional way [@problem_id:4716240].

Furthermore, specific BPSD can be mapped to the neurobiological changes of the underlying disease:
*   **Agitation** often reflects an unmet need, such as pain from arthritis, in a patient who cannot articulate their discomfort.
*   **Visual hallucinations** are often linked to cholinergic deficits and dysfunction in posterior cortical visual networks.
*   **Apathy** is associated with hypoactivity in frontal-subcortical circuits involved in motivation, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex.
*   **Disinhibition** and socially inappropriate behaviors are classic signs of orbitofrontal cortex dysfunction.
*   **Sleep disturbances** and [circadian rhythm disruption](@entry_id:167917) often stem from degeneration of the [suprachiasmatic nucleus](@entry_id:148495) (SCN), the brain’s master clock [@problem_id:4716240].

### Principles of Pharmacological Intervention

While non-pharmacological strategies are the first line of treatment for many conditions in geriatric psychiatry, pharmacotherapy is often necessary. However, the principle of "start low, go slow, but go" is paramount, and it is rooted in predictable age-related changes in pharmacokinetics—what the body does to a drug. These changes, summarized by the acronym **ADME** (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion), alter a drug's concentration and duration of action [@problem_id:4716213].

*   **Absorption:** While age-related changes in gastric pH and motility can slow the rate of drug absorption, the overall extent of absorption for most drugs is not significantly changed.

*   **Distribution:** Body composition changes profoundly with age. The proportion of **body fat increases**, while **total body water decreases**.
    *   For **lipophilic** (fat-soluble) drugs like many [benzodiazepines](@entry_id:174923) and antidepressants, the increased body fat provides a larger reservoir for the drug to accumulate. This increases the **volume of distribution ($V_d$)** and prolongs the elimination **half-life ($t_{1/2}$)**, raising the risk of drug accumulation and toxicity.
    *   For **hydrophilic** (water-soluble) drugs like lithium, the decreased total body water leads to a smaller $V_d$. This results in a higher peak plasma concentration for a given dose, increasing the risk of acute toxicity.

*   **Metabolism:** Hepatic metabolism, particularly **Phase I oxidation** by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system, tends to decline with age. This can decrease the [first-pass metabolism](@entry_id:136753) of certain drugs, leading to higher oral bioavailability, and can slow the clearance of drugs dependent on this pathway.

*   **Excretion:** Renal function reliably declines with age. The [glomerular filtration rate](@entry_id:164274) (GFR) decreases, but because older adults also have less muscle mass and thus produce less creatinine, the **serum creatinine level can remain in the normal range despite a significantly reduced GFR**. This is a critical clinical pitfall. For drugs eliminated by the kidneys, such as lithium, this reduced clearance will dramatically prolong the half-life and necessitate significant dose reductions to prevent toxicity.

Finally, a modest decrease in **serum albumin**, the primary binding protein for many acidic drugs, can lead to a higher **fraction unbound ($f_u$)**. Since it is the unbound drug that is pharmacologically active, this can potentiate the drug’s effect and risk of side effects even at standard total drug concentrations [@problem_id:4716213].
