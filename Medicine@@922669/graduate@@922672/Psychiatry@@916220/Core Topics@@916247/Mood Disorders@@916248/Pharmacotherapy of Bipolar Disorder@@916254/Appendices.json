The amount of drug $A(t)$ is related to the plasma concentration $C(t)$ by the apparent volume of distribution $V_d$, such that $A(t) = V_d C(t)$. Clearance, $\\mathrm{CL}$, is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of drug per unit time, and is related to $k_{el}$ and $V_d$ by $\\mathrm{CL} = k_{el} V_d$. Substituting these into the rate of elimination expression gives:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of elimination} = ( \\frac{\\mathrm{CL}}{V_d} ) (V_d C(t)) = \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nAt steady state, the system has reached an equilibrium where the average rate of drug input equals the average rate of drug elimination over one dosing interval, $\\tau$.

The term under the square root is always greater than $(B_{\\max} + K_d - C_t)^2$, so its square root is greater than $|B_{\\max} + K_d - C_t|$. The negative root would result in a negative value for $C_f$. Thus, the unique valid solution is:\n$$\nC_f = \\frac{C_t - B_{\\max} - K_d + \\sqrt{(B_{\\max} + K_d - C_t)^2 + 4 C_t K_d}}{2}\n$$\n\nNow we compute $C_f$ for the two scenarios.\n\nCase 1: Normal albumin ($B_{\\max, normal} = 0.60150$ mM)\nThe coefficient $b$ in the quadratic equation is:\n$$\nb_{normal} = B_{\\max, normal} + K_d - C_t = 0.60150 \\text{ mM} + 0.020 \\text{ mM} - 0.55475 \\text{ mM} \\approx 0.06675 \\text{ mM}\n$$\nThe coefficient $c$ is:\n$$\nc = -C_t K_d = -(0.55475 \\text{ mM})(0.020 \\text{ mM}) \\approx -0.011095 \\text{ mM}^2\n$$\nThe equation is $C_f^2 + 0.06675 C_f - 0.011095 = 0$.
