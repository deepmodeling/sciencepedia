The experiment provides $p_{d} = 0.40$ and $p_{c} = 0.20$.\n\nA fundamental way to quantify preventive effect at the population level over the same horizon is the absolute risk reduction, defined from first principles as the difference in absolute risks attributable to the intervention over that horizon, namely\n$$\n\\Delta p \\equiv p_{d} - p_{c}.\n$$\nThis quantity represents the expected number of events averted per treated individual over the specified horizon.\n\nTo convert an event difference per individual into a count of individuals needed to generate one averted event, we take the reciprocal, yielding the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), defined as\n$$\n\\mathrm{NNT} \\equiv \\frac{1}{\\Delta p} = \\frac{1}{p_{d} - p_{c}}.\n$$\nSubstituting the provided risks gives\n$$\n\\Delta p = 0.40 - 0.20 = 0.20,\n$$\nand thus\n$$\n\\mathrm{NNT} = \\frac{1}{0.20} = 5.\n$$\n\nInterpretation in clinical terms: under conditions similar to the trial and over a $12$-month horizon with baseline risk near $0.40$ under discontinuation, continuing maintenance antidepressant therapy rather than discontinuing for $5$ comparable patients would, on average, prevent $1$ additional relapse within $12$ months.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the constant hazard ratio ($HR$) from the survival probabilities of two groups at a specific time point, under the Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model. The derivation must start from the fundamental relationships connecting the survival function, $S(t)$, the hazard function, $h(t)$, and the cumulative hazard function, $H(t)$.\n\nLet $t$ be the time variable. The fundamental relationship between the survival function and the cumulative hazard function is:\n$$S(t) = \\exp(-H(t))$$\nwhere the cumulative hazard function is the integral of the hazard function from time $0$ to $t$:\n$$H(t) = \\int_0^t h(u) \\, du$$\n\nLet the usual care group be the reference group, and the maintenance therapy group be the intervention group.

The symptoms, signs, and laboratory values (elevated TSH, low $fT4$) are pathognomonic for overt primary hypothyroidism. The provided foundational facts are cornerstones of evidence-based practice in both psychiatry and endocrinology.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary clinical data to make a management decision. The objective is clearly defined: to select the protocol that optimizes two concurrent goals (preserving mood stability and treating thyroid dysfunction). A single best course of action can be determined by applying the given foundational principles.\n*   **Objective:** The language is clinical, precise, and objective. No subjective or speculative claims are made.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, internally consistent, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. Therefore, the problem is **valid**, and a solution can be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe patient's clinical situation must be analyzed through the lens of the provided foundational principles.\n\n1.  **Diagnosis:** The patient presents with clinical symptoms (fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, cognitive slowing) and laboratory results (TSH $= 12\\,\\text{mIU/L}$ [elevated], $fT4 = 0.6\\,\\text{ng/dL}$ [low]) that unequivocally define **overt primary hypothyroidism**. The positive thyroid peroxidase antibodies suggest an underlying autoimmune etiology, which is frequently exacerbated or unmasked by lithium.\n\n2.  **Psychiatric Management Priority:** The patient has BD-I and has been stable in full remission for $18$ months on lithium. As per principle (i), discontinuation of an effective mood stabilizer, particularly lithium, carries a very high risk of relapse into a manic or depressive episode. The patient's lithium level is within the established therapeutic maintenance range of $0.6$–$0.8\\,\\text{mmol/L}$ (principle v). Therefore, maintaining the current lithium therapy is of paramount importance for relapse prevention.\n\n3.  **Endocrine Management Priority:** The patient has overt hypothyroidism. Per principle (ii), the standard of care for overt hypothyroidism is hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine (T4) to restore a euthyroid state. Untreated hypothyroidism itself can cause or worsen depressive symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, and overall morbidity, which could be misattributed to the primary mood disorder or destabilize it.\n\n4.  **Integration of Management:** Principle (iii) directly addresses the intersection of these two priorities. It states that when hypothyroidism occurs in a patient for whom lithium is an effective treatment, the hypothyroidism should be managed with thyroid hormone replacement, and the lithium should be continued. Stopping the lithium is contraindicated.\n\n5.  **Pharmacokinetic Considerations for Treatment:** Principle (iv) dictates the timeline for treatment adjustment. Levothyroxine has a half-life of about $7$ days. It takes approximately $5$ half-lives ($5 \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 35 \\text{ days}$) to reach a new steady-state concentration. Therefore, assessing the response to a given dose via TSH measurement should be done no sooner than $4$–$6$ weeks, with $6$–$8$ weeks being a standard clinical interval for titration. Treatment initiation requires a safe starting dose (e.g., $25$–$50\\,\\mu\\text{g}$ daily in a young adult) to avoid iatrogenic hyperthyroidism, which can precipitate anxiety or mania.\n\n6.  **Comprehensive Monitoring:** For any patient on lithium, regular monitoring of serum lithium levels and renal function (eGFR) is mandatory. The patient's eGFR of $75\\,\\text{mL/min/1.73\\,\\text{m}^2}$ is mildly reduced and warrants ongoing surveillance. Thyroid function ($TSH$, $fT4$) must also be monitored to ensure an appropriate levothyroxine dose.\n\nBased on these first principles, the optimal protocol is to continue lithium at its current effective dose and level, initiate levothyroxine replacement therapy starting with a low dose, titrate the dose every $6$–$8$ weeks based on TSH to achieve euthyroidism, and continue all necessary safety monitoring.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Continue lithium targeting $0.6$–$0.8\\,\\text{mmol/L}$, initiate levothyroxine at $25$–$50\\,\\mu\\text{g}$ daily, titrate every $6$–$8$ weeks to achieve $TSH$ in the reference range (e.g., $0.5$–$2.5\\,\\text{mIU/L}$), monitor $fT4$, lithium levels, and eGFR at similar intervals, and coordinate with endocrinology; counsel on adherence and watch for mood activation if over-replacement occurs.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This protocol is perfectly aligned with the derived optimal management plan. It adheres to all foundational principles: it continues the effective mood stabilizer (i, iii, v), treats the overt hypothyroidism with the standard agent (ii), uses a correct titration interval based on pharmacokinetics (iv), and includes all necessary monitoring and patient management components.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Discontinue lithium within $1$ week to reverse the hypothyroid effect and transition to valproate; defer levothyroxine unless $TSH > 20\\,\\text{mIU/L}$ or symptoms worsen; re-evaluate mood status monthly.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This protocol is deeply flawed and dangerous. It directly violates principle (i) by abruptly discontinuing an effective mood stabilizer, creating a high risk of relapse. It violates principle (iii), which explicitly recommends against stopping lithium in this scenario. It also violates principle (ii) by withholding standard treatment for overt, symptomatic hypothyroidism. The threshold of $TSH > 20\\,\\text{mIU/L}$ is arbitrary and constitutes clinical inertia.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Reduce lithium to achieve a trough $< 0.4\\,\\text{mmol/L}$ and observe without thyroid replacement for $12$ weeks, rechecking $TSH$ and $fT4$; if thyroid indices normalize, maintain reduced lithium dose thereafter.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This protocol is also incorrect. Reducing lithium to a subtherapeutic level ($< 0.4\\,\\text{mmol/L}$) compromises its efficacy and increases relapse risk, thus violating the spirit of principles (i) and (v). Furthermore, it withholds necessary treatment for overt hypothyroidism for an extended period of $12$ weeks, violating principle (ii) and causing prolonged morbidity for the patient. There is no guarantee that a lower lithium dose would normalize thyroid function.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Maintain lithium unchanged and add liothyronine ($T3$) at $25\\,\\mu\\text{g}$ daily in divided doses to speed symptomatic improvement, rechecking $TSH$ and $fT4$ in $2$ weeks; consider eventual cross-titration off lithium if $TSH$ remains elevated.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This protocol is suboptimal and contains a logical error. While it correctly maintains lithium, it proposes using liothyronine (T3) monotherapy, which is not the standard of care for primary hypothyroidism (violates principle ii). Levothyroxine (T4) is the recommended first-line agent. The suggestion to \"consider...cross-titration off lithium if TSH remains elevated\" is a critical flaw in reasoning; an elevated TSH would indicate the need to adjust the thyroid hormone dose, not to discontinue the essential mood stabilizer (violates principle iii).\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Continue lithium and initiate iodine $150\\,\\mu\\text{g}$ daily and selenium $200\\,\\mu\\text{g}$ daily, avoiding levothyroxine to prevent mood destabilization; re-evaluate thyroid function in $8$ weeks before considering hormone replacement.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This approach recommends unproven-of-concept therapies (iodine and selenium supplementation) in place of the established standard of care for overt hypothyroidism. This violates principle (ii). In a patient with positive antibodies suggestive of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, supplemental iodine can paradoxically worsen hypothyroidism. The rationale to avoid levothyroxine \"to prevent mood destabilization\" is fallacious; untreated hypothyroidism is a greater risk to mood stability than properly managed hormone replacement. Delaying effective treatment for $8$ weeks is inappropriate.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4754126"}]}
