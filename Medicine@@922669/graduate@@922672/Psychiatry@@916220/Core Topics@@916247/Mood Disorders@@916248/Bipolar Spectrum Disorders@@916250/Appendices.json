The task is to validate the problem statement and then determine the most accurate option.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Patient Demographics:** $29$-year-old with a $7$-year history of episodic mood symptoms.\n- **History of Elevated Mood:** At least $2$ distinct periods, each lasting about $5$ days. Symptoms included elevated/irritable mood, increased goal-directed activity, decreased need for sleep ($3$ hours/night, felt rested), more talkative, risky spending. These episodes did not involve psychosis, severe impairment, or hospitalization. The patient's mood returned to baseline between episodes.\n- **Exclusion of Mania:** The patient denies any episodes of similar mood elevation lasting $\\geq 7$ days or requiring hospitalization.\n- **Current Episode:** Lasting for the past $3$ weeks, characterized by depressed mood, anhedonia, fatigue, impaired concentration, feelings of worthlessness, and early morning awakening. The patient is missing work due to these symptoms.\n- **Mixed Features in Current Episode:** During the current depressive period, the patient also reports episodic racing thoughts, being more talkative than usual, distractibility, and a surge of goal-directed activity in the evenings, while remaining subjectively depressed.\n- **Suicidality:** Current passive suicidal ideation without a plan or intent. History of one prior suicide attempt $1$ year ago.\n- **Psychotic Symptoms:** None present.\n- **Substance Use & Medications:** Urine toxicology is negative. Alcohol use is $2$ drinks per week. Caffeine is $1$ cup per day. No use of corticosteroids or stimulants.\n- **Family History:** A sibling with bipolar disorder.\n- **Medical Status:** Medical screening is unremarkable.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement describes a clinical psychiatric case. The validation will assess its scientific and logical integrity based on established diagnostic criteria, such as those found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-$5$).\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The symptom description is consistent with the established nosology of mood disorders. The concepts of hypomania, major depression, and mixed features are core components of modern psychiatric diagnosis. The patient's history and current presentation form a coherent and classic, albeit complex, clinical picture.\n- **Well-Posed:** The vignette provides sufficient specific information (symptom types, duration, severity, course, family history, substance use) to allow for a rigorous differential diagnosis and the formulation of a treatment plan. The question asks for the \"most accurate and concise diagnostic note,\" which is a standard, solvable task in clinical medicine.\n- **Objective:** The language is descriptive and clinical, presenting patient reports and objective findings (e.g., negative toxicology). It is free from subjective or biased phrasing.\n- **Consistency and Completeness:** The data are internally consistent. The history of episodes lasting $5$ days with specific symptoms meets the DSM-$5$ criteria for a hypomanic episode (duration $\\geq 4$ days, observable change in functioning, but not causing marked impairment or hospitalization). The explicit denial of longer or more severe episodes correctly rules out a manic episode. The current $3$-week period with classic depressive symptoms meets the criteria for a major depressive episode (duration $\\geq 2$ weeks, with $\\geq 5$ core symptoms). The co-occurrence of several (specifically, $\\geq 3$) manic/hypomanic symptoms during this major depressive episode correctly defines the \"with mixed features\" specifier. The problem is self-contained and complete for its purpose.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent, presenting a realistic clinical scenario that can be analyzed using standard psychiatric principles. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**1. Diagnostic Formulation:**\nThe diagnostic process requires integrating the patient's entire history.\n- **Bipolar II Disorder vs. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** The core differentiating factor is the history of a hypomanic episode. The patient reports at least $2$ distinct episodes lasting about $5$ days with classic hypomanic symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased talkativeness, goal-directed activity) and without severe impairment or hospitalization. This history definitively meets the criteria for a hypomanic episode. The presence of at least one confirmed hypomanic episode and at least one major depressive episode (the current one) establishes the diagnosis of **Bipolar II Disorder**. A diagnosis of MDD is incorrect because it requires that there has never been a manic or hypomanic episode.\n- **Bipolar II Disorder vs. Bipolar I Disorder:** Bipolar I Disorder is defined by the presence of at least one manic episode. A manic episode requires a mood disturbance lasting at least $1$ week (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary) and causing marked impairment, psychotic features, or necessitating hospitalization. The patient explicitly denies such episodes. Therefore, Bipolar I Disorder is ruled out.\n- **Current Episode Specification:** The patient is currently experiencing a major depressive episode. However, during this depression, they also report concurrent hypomanic symptoms (racing thoughts, talkativeness, distractibility, increased activity). According to DSM-$5$, when at least $3$ manic/hypomanic symptoms are present during a major depressive episode, the specifier \"with mixed features\" is applied.\n- **Conclusion:** The most accurate diagnosis is **Bipolar II Disorder, current episode major depression with mixed features.**\n\n**2. Differential Diagnosis:**\n- **Cyclothymic Disorder:** This is ruled out because the patient has experienced full-threshold major depressive and hypomanic episodes. Cyclothymia involves sub-threshold symptoms.\n- **Substance/Medication-Induced Mood Disorder:** The negative toxicology, low levels of substance use, and absence of offending medications make this diagnosis highly unlikely.\n- **ADHD:** The patient's attentional problems (distractibility, racing thoughts) are episodic and co-occur with mood symptoms, rather than being a pervasive, lifelong pattern starting in childhood, making ADHD a less likely primary diagnosis.\n- **Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD):** BPD involves a pervasive pattern of affective instability, typically in response to interpersonal stressors. The patient's presentation is one of distinct, sustained mood episodes with a return to a euthymic baseline, which is characteristic of bipolar disorder, not BPD.\n\n**3. Risk Assessment:**\nThe suicide risk is elevated. Multiple factors contribute to this assessment:\n- Current passive suicidal ideation.\n- A history of a prior suicide attempt, which is one of the strongest predictors of future attempts.\n- The current state is a major depressive episode, a period of high risk.\n- The diagnosis of bipolar disorder itself carries a significantly increased lifetime risk of suicide.\n- The presence of mixed features can increase agitation and impulsivity, further elevating risk.\n- Family history of bipolar disorder is another risk factor.\nA \"low\" risk assessment would be clinically inappropriate. The risk should be classified as **moderate to high**, warranting immediate intervention such as safety planning, means restriction, and close follow-up.\n\n**4. Treatment Plan:**\nThe treatment must address bipolar depression with mixed features while minimizing the risk of iatrogenic mood destabilization.\n- **Antidepressant Monotherapy:** Treatment with an antidepressant alone (e.g., SSRI, SNRI, bupropion) is **contraindicated**. It carries a significant risk of inducing a switch to hypomania/mania or provoking a mixed state or rapid cycling. This risk is particularly pronounced in patients with mixed features.\n- **First-Line Pharmacotherapy:** Evidence-based guidelines recommend initiating a mood stabilizer (e.g., lithium, lamotrigine) or a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) that has demonstrated efficacy in bipolar depression (e.g., quetiapine, lurasidone, cariprazine).\n- **Psychosocial Interventions:** Adjunctive psychotherapy is a critical component of care. Evidence-based modalities include Psychoeducation, Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT), and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).\n- **Monitoring and Follow-up:** Given the moderate-to-high suicide risk and the initiation of a new medication regimen, close monitoring is essential. A follow-up appointment within $1$ week is standard practice. A crisis plan should be established.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Diagnosis: Major Depressive Disorder with mixed features. Differential: Bipolar II disorder, cyclothymic disorder. Risk: Low acute suicide risk given no current intent; routine follow-up. Treatment: Start selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) monotherapy (e.g., sertraline), titrate over $4$ weeks; defer mood stabilizer unless hypomania recurs.**\n- **Diagnosis:** Incorrect. It disregards the clear history of hypomanic episodes, which is the defining feature of Bipolar II Disorder.\n- **Risk:** Incorrect. The risk assessment is dangerously understated. A prior attempt and current SI in a depressive episode warrant an assessment of at least moderate risk and require urgent, not \"routine,\" follow-up.\n- **Treatment:** Incorrect. SSRI monotherapy is contraindicated and potentially harmful in this context.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Diagnosis: Bipolar I Disorder, current mixed episode. Differential: Substance-induced mood disorder. Risk: Low-to-moderate risk; no prior attempts; outpatient follow-up in $1$ month. Treatment: Initiate venlafaxine monotherapy for depressive symptoms; add benzodiazepine as needed; avoid antipsychotics to prevent sedation.**\n- **Diagnosis:** Incorrect. The patient's history lacks a manic episode, which is required for a Bipolar I diagnosis.\n- **Risk:** Incorrect. The statement \"no prior attempts\" is factually false based on the vignette. A $1$-month follow-up is too long.\n- **Treatment:** Incorrect. Venlafaxine (SNRI) monotherapy is contraindicated.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Diagnosis: Bipolar II Disorder, current hypomanic episode with mixed features. Differential: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), borderline personality disorder. Risk: Moderate suicide risk due to prior attempt; safety plan only. Treatment: Start bupropion monotherapy given low switch risk; consider psychotherapy after mood improves; avoid lithium due to side effects.**\n- **Diagnosis:** Incorrect. The patient's current episode is a major depressive episode, not a hypomanic one. The vignette states the patient has \"depressed mood, anhedonia\" and is \"subjectively depressed.\"\n- **Risk:** Partially correct on risk level, but \"safety plan only\" is an incomplete intervention.\n- **Treatment:** Incorrect. Bupropion monotherapy is still not a first-line, evidence-based treatment for bipolar depression and carries a risk of destabilization. Deferring psychotherapy is not ideal. Avoiding lithium preemptively \"due to side effects\" is poor clinical reasoning; it is a first-line agent, and side effects are to be managed, not used as a reason for absolute avoidance without a trial or specific contraindication.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Diagnosis: Bipolar II Disorder, current episode major depression with mixed features (without psychotic features); past hypomanic episodes by history; no lifetime manic episode. Differential: Cyclothymic disorder (ruled out by threshold major depressive and hypomanic episodes), Bipolar I disorder (no history of mania or hospitalization), Major Depressive Disorder with mixed features (history of hypomania makes bipolar II more likely), substance-induced mood disorder (negative toxicology and episodes occurred independent of substances), ADHD (inattention is episodic and mood-linked), borderline personality disorder (affective shifts are episodic with inter-episode euthymia rather than pervasive reactivity).

This is precise, comprehensive, and fully supported by the vignette.\n- **Differential:** Correct. Provides a thorough and accurate differential with sound reasoning for each.\n- **Risk:** Correct. A nuanced and clinically appropriate assessment of risk, identifying relevant factors and necessary interventions.\n- **Treatment:** Correct.

Express the final dose in mg. No rounding is required beyond the exact calculation.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of a new total daily dose of lithium carbonate to achieve a target trough serum concentration in the presence of an interacting drug. The solution will be derived from the fundamental principle of mass balance for a drug at steady state.\n\n**Step 1: Problem Validation**\n\nFirst, a validation of the problem statement is performed.\nThe extracted givens are:\n-   Initial total daily dose of lithium carbonate, $D_1 = 900$ mg.\n-   Initial steady-state trough serum lithium concentration, $C_{ss,trough,1} = 0.4$ mmol/L.\n-   Target steady-state trough serum lithium concentration, $C_{ss,trough,2} = 0.8$ mmol/L.\n-   A Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) is initiated.\n-   The NSAID causes a decrease in renal lithium clearance of $25\\%$.\n-   Assumptions: linear pharmacokinetics, constant bioavailability, unchanged dosing interval and formulation, and constant proportionality between trough and average steady-state concentrations.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it describes a well-documented and clinically significant drug-drug interaction between lithium and NSAIDs. The pharmacokinetic principles, such as linear kinetics and the concept of steady state, are standard in pharmacology. The given values for doses and concentrations are realistic for clinical practice in treating Bipolar I disorder. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information and explicit assumptions to allow for a unique, meaningful solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe fundamental principle of pharmacokinetics at steady state is that the rate of drug administration is equal to the rate of drug elimination.\n\nLet $R_{in}$ be the average rate of drug administration and $R_{out}$ be the average rate of drug elimination. At steady state, we have:\n$$R_{in} = R_{out}$$\n\nThe average rate of drug elimination, $R_{out}$, is the product of the total body clearance of the drug, $CL$, and the average steady-state plasma concentration, $C_{ss,avg}$.\n$$R_{out} = CL \\times C_{ss,avg}$$\n\nThe average rate of drug administration, $R_{in}$, is proportional to the total daily dose, $D$. Let's express this as $R_{in} = k_A \\cdot D$, where $k_A$ is a constant of proportionality that incorporates factors such as bioavailability ($F$) and the salt factor ($S$) of lithium carbonate. The problem states that bioavailability and the drug formulation are constant, so $k_A$ is constant between the two scenarios.\n\nCombining these gives the steady-state equation:\n$$k_A \\cdot D = CL \\times C_{ss,avg}$$\n\nThe problem provides trough concentrations ($C_{ss,trough}$) rather than average concentrations. A key assumption is that the proportionality between trough and average concentration is constant. This can be expressed as:\n$$C_{ss,trough} = k_p \\cdot C_{ss,avg}$$\nwhere $k_p$ is another constant of proportionality. This assumption is reasonable given that the dosing interval and formulation (immediate-release) are unchanged. From this, we can write $C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{C_{ss,trough}}{k_p}$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $C_{ss,avg}$ into the steady-state equation:\n$$k_A \\cdot D = CL \\times \\left(\\frac{C_{ss,trough}}{k_p}\\right)$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the trough concentration:\n$$C_{ss,trough} = \\frac{k_A \\cdot k_p}{CL} \\cdot D$$\n\nLet's define a combined constant $K = k_A \\cdot k_p$. Since $k_A$ and $k_p$ are constant for this patient under the specified conditions, $K$ is also a constant. The relationship simplifies to:\n$$C_{ss,trough} = K \\cdot \\frac{D}{CL}$$\nThis equation shows that the steady-state trough concentration is directly proportional to the daily dose and inversely proportional to the total body clearance.\n\n**Step 3: Application to the Specific Scenarios**\n\nWe can now apply this relationship to the two states described in the problem:\n1.  **Initial State (subscript 1):** Before the NSAID is started.\n    $$C_{ss,trough,1} = K \\cdot \\frac{D_1}{CL_1}$$\n2.  **Target State (subscript 2):** After the NSAID is started.\n    $$C_{ss,trough,2} = K \\cdot \\frac{D_2}{CL_2}$$\n\nHere, $D_1$ and $CL_1$ are the initial daily dose and clearance, and $D_2$ and $CL_2$ are the new daily dose and clearance, respectively. To find the new dose $D_2$, we can take the ratio of the equation for State $2$ to the equation for State $1$:\n$$\\frac{C_{ss,trough,2}}{C_{ss,trough,1}} = \\frac{K \\cdot \\frac{D_2}{CL_2}}{K \\cdot \\frac{D_1}{CL_1}}$$\n\nThe constant $K$ cancels out, yielding:\n$$\\frac{C_{ss,trough,2}}{C_{ss,trough,1}} = \\frac{D_2}{D_1} \\cdot \\frac{CL_1}{CL_2}$$\n\nWe are seeking the new dose, $D_2$. Rearranging the equation to solve for $D_2$:\n$$D_2 = D_1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{C_{ss,trough,2}}{C_{ss,trough,1}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{CL_2}{CL_1}\\right)$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculation of the New Dose**\n\nNow we substitute the given values into this equation.\n-   Initial dose, $D_1 = 900$ mg.\n-   Initial trough concentration, $C_{ss,trough,1} = 0.4$ mmol/L.\n-   Target trough concentration, $C_{ss,trough,2} = 0.8$ mmol/L.\n\nThe problem states that the patient's renal lithium clearance will decrease by $25\\%$ when the NSAID is started. Since lithium is cleared almost exclusively by the kidneys, we assume the total body clearance, $CL$, decreases by the same amount.\nThe new clearance, $CL_2$, is related to the initial clearance, $CL_1$, as follows:\n$$CL_2 = CL_1 - (0.25 \\times CL_1) = (1 - 0.25) \\times CL_1 = 0.75 \\times CL_1$$\n\nFrom this, the ratio of the clearances is:\n$$\\frac{CL_2}{CL_1} = 0.75$$\n\nSubstituting all values into the equation for $D_2$:\n$$D_2 = 900 \\text{ mg} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{0.8 \\text{ mmol/L}}{0.4 \\text{ mmol/L}}\\right) \\cdot (0.75)$$\n$$D_2 = 900 \\cdot (2) \\cdot (0.75)$$\n$$D_2 = 1800 \\cdot (0.75)$$\n$$D_2 = 1350 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nThe new total daily lithium dose required to achieve the target trough concentration of $0.8$ mmol/L is $1350$ mg.
