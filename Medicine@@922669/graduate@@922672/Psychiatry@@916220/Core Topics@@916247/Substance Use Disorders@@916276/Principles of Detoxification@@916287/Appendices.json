As foundational pharmacologic facts, use the following standardized equipotency data to convert to diazepam equivalents, reflecting equipotent Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) type A receptor modulation: clonazepam 0.50 mg is equipotent to diazepam 10.0 mg; lorazepam 1.00 mg is equipotent to diazepam 10.0 mg; oxazepam 30.0 mg is equipotent to diazepam 10.0 mg. To mitigate oversedation due to diazepam’s long elimination half-life and active metabolites, apply a conservative safety factor $s = 0.80$ to the computed diazepam-equivalent daily dose before initiating the unified taper. The detoxification plan is to reduce the adjusted daily diazepam dose linearly to $0$ over $9$ weeks with equal absolute weekly decrements.\n\nStarting from the definition of equipotency and the concept of linear tapering (constant absolute weekly decrease) derived from first principles of dose equivalence and linear scheduling, calculate the constant weekly absolute reduction in the daily diazepam dose.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is derived from the first principles of dose equivalence and linear functions.\n\nFirst, we establish the conversion factors for each benzodiazepine to its diazepam equivalent dose based on the principle of equipotency. The conversion factor, $C_{BZD \\to DZP}$, is the ratio of the equivalent diazepam dose to the given benzodiazepine dose.\n\nFor clonazepam (CLO):\n$$C_{CLO \\to DZP} = \\frac{10.0 \\text{ mg DZP}}{0.50 \\text{ mg CLO}} = 20.0 \\frac{\\text{mg DZP}}{\\text{mg CLO}}$$\n\nFor lorazepam (LOR):\n$$C_{LOR \\to DZP} = \\frac{10.0 \\text{ mg DZP}}{1.00 \\text{ mg LOR}} = 10.0 \\frac{\\text{mg DZP}}{\\text{mg LOR}}$$\n\nFor oxazepam (OXA):\n$$C_{OXA \\to DZP} = \\frac{10.0 \\text{ mg DZP}}{30.0 \\text{ mg OXA}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{\\text{mg DZP}}{\\text{mg OXA}}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total daily diazepam-equivalent dose, $D_{DZP,eq}$, by summing the equivalent doses of each medication the patient is taking.\n$$D_{DZP,eq} = (D_{CLO} \\times C_{CLO \\to DZP}) + (D_{LOR} \\times C_{LOR \\to DZP}) + (D_{OXA} \\times C_{OXA \\to DZP})$$\nSubstituting the patient's daily doses:\n$$D_{DZP,eq} = (1.25 \\text{ mg} \\times 20.0) + (1.50 \\text{ mg} \\times 10.0) + (37.50 \\text{ mg} \\times \\frac{1}{3})$$\n$$D_{DZP,eq} = 25.0 \\text{ mg} + 15.0 \\text{ mg} + 12.50 \\text{ mg}$$\n$$D_{DZP,eq} = 52.50 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nNow, we apply the conservative safety factor, $s = 0.80$, to determine the initial daily dose of diazepam for the taper, denoted as $D_{start}$. This is a standard clinical adjustment to mitigate risks like oversedation.\n$$D_{start} = D_{DZP,eq} \\times s$$\n$$D_{start} = 52.50 \\text{ mg} \\times 0.80$$\n$$D_{start} = 42.0 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires a linear taper to a dose of $0$ over a period of $T = 9$ weeks. A linear taper is defined by a constant absolute reduction in dose per unit of time. Let $\\Delta D$ represent this constant weekly absolute reduction. The total dose to be eliminated is $D_{start}$, and this must be accomplished over the total time $T$. Therefore, the weekly reduction is the total starting dose divided by the number of weeks.\n$$\\Delta D = \\frac{D_{start} - D_{final}}{T}$$\nGiven that the final dose is $D_{final} = 0$:\n$$\\Delta D = \\frac{D_{start}}{T}$$\nSubstituting the calculated starting dose and the given time period:\n$$\\Delta D = \\frac{42.0 \\text{ mg}}{9 \\text{ weeks}}$$\n$$\\Delta D = 4.666... \\text{ mg/week}$$\n\nThe final step is to round the result to four significant figures as requested.\n$$\\Delta D \\approx 4.667 \\text{ mg/week}$$\nThis value, $\\Delta D$, represents the constant weekly absolute reduction in the daily diazepam dose.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{4.667} $$", "id": "4743539"}, {"introduction": "Effective detoxification often involves adjunctive medications to manage symptoms, but their dosing must be tailored to the individual.
