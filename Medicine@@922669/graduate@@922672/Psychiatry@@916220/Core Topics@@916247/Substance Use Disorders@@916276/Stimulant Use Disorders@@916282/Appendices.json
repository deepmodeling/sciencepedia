The clinical effects of a stimulant, from therapeutic action to abuse liability, are largely dictated by its binding affinity for different monoamine transporters.

The use of inhibition constants ($K_i$) to characterize drug-target interactions is a standard method. The law of mass action is the fundamental basis for describing such binding equilibria. The values of the inhibition constants are given in nanomolar ($\\mathrm{nM}$) units, which are realistic for drug candidates targeting monoamine transporters. The concept of a selectivity index is a cornerstone of drug design, used to predict the relative biological effects of a compound. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and a clear, operational definition for the quantity to be calculated. The language is objective and free of non-scientific claims. There are no contradictions, missing information, or violations of scientific principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived from the stated foundational principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, of a transporter by a competitive ligand (the drug) is the fraction of the total transporter population that is bound by the ligand. For a single-site binding model that follows the law of mass action, the fractional occupancy is described by the Hill-Langmuir equation:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_i} $$\nwhere $[L]$ is the concentration of the unbound ligand and $K_i$ is the inhibition constant, which for a competitive inhibitor is equivalent to its dissociation constant ($K_d$) under the conditions of the assay.\n\nThe problem specifies that the analysis should be conducted in the \"low-occupancy regime\", where $[L] \\ll K_i$. Under this condition, the denominator of the occupancy equation can be simplified:\n$$ [L] + K_i \\approx K_i $$\nSubstituting this approximation back into the equation for fractional occupancy yields a simplified expression for occupancy in the low-concentration limit:\n$$ \\theta \\approx \\frac{[L]}{K_i} $$\nThis simplified expression, $\\theta \\approx [L]/K_i$, represents the \"propensity to occupy\" a transporter at a given low concentration $[L]$. It shows that, under these conditions, the likelihood of a transporter being occupied is directly proportional to the drug concentration and inversely proportional to the inhibition constant. A lower $K_i$ signifies higher affinity and thus a greater propensity for binding.\n\nThe problem defines the dopaminergic-versus-serotonergic selectivity index, which we denote as $S_{\\mathrm{DAT/SERT}}$, as the ratio of the propensity to occupy DAT to the propensity to occupy SERT. Using our derived expression for propensity, this ratio is:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{DAT/SERT}} = \\frac{\\theta_{\\mathrm{DAT}}}{\\theta_{\\mathrm{SERT}}} $$\nWe apply the low-occupancy approximation for both transporters:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{DAT/SERT}} \\approx \\frac{[L]/K_i^{\\mathrm{DAT}}}{[L]/K_i^{\\mathrm{SERT}}} $$\nThe problem specifies \"equal-free-concentration conditions\", meaning the concentration $[L]$ is identical for both transporter systems. Therefore, the term $[L]$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding the final expression for the selectivity index:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{DAT/SERT}} = \\frac{K_i^{\\mathrm{SERT}}}{K_i^{\\mathrm{DAT}}} $$\nThis result demonstrates that the selectivity of a drug between two targets in the low-concentration regime is given by the inverse ratio of their respective inhibition constants.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$K_i^{\\mathrm{DAT}} = 4.50 \\times 10^{1}\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 45.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_i^{\\mathrm{SERT}} = 2.70 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 2700\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the selectivity index:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{DAT/SERT}} = \\frac{2700\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{45.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}} $$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{nM}$ cancel, making the index a dimensionless quantity as required. Performing the division:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{DAT/SERT}} = 60.0 $$\nThe input values have three significant figures, so the result is appropriately reported to three significant figures.\n\n### Inference on Clinical Features\nThe calculated selectivity index of $S_{\\mathrm{DAT/SERT}} = 60.0$ indicates that, at any given low concentration, the drug has a $60.0$-fold greater propensity to occupy the dopamine transporter (DAT) than the serotonin transporter (SERT). The primary function of DAT is the reuptake of dopamine from the synapse; its inhibition leads to increased synaptic dopamine levels. The clinical effects of elevated dopamine are associated with the classic stimulant profile: euphoria, increased arousal and motivation, and psychomotor activation. In contrast, the serotonin transporter (SERT) clears serotonin from the synapse. While potent SERT inhibition can cause significant effects, the drug's action on SERT is minimal compared to its action on DAT. Therefore, based on the high selectivity for DAT over SERT, it is logical to infer that the clinical features of early intoxication will be predominantly dopaminergic. The observed symptomatology would be expected to closely resemble that of known DAT-preferring stimulants, such as cocaine or methylphenidate, rather than serotonergic agents. The effects on the norepinephrine transporter (NET), with $K_i^{\\mathrm{NET}} = 120\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, would also be significant (selectivity $S_{\\mathrm{DAT/NET}} = K_i^{\\mathrm{NET}}/K_i^{\\mathrm{DAT}} = 120/45.0 \\approx 2.67$), contributing sympathomimetic effects like increased heart rate and blood pressure, but the dopaminergic profile will dominate over the serotonergic one by a large margin.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{60.0}\n$$", "id": "4761759"}, {"introduction": "In the acute clinical setting, it is critical to distinguish between the transient state of stimulant intoxication and the longitudinal diagnosis of a Stimulant Use Disorder (StUD).

The reported history, signs (tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis, diaphoresis, agitation), symptoms (euphoria, chest tightness), and laboratory finding (positive urine screen) are all consistent with the known pharmacology and clinical effects of cocaine, a central nervous system stimulant. The diagnostic task—differentiating acute intoxication from a substance use disorder—is a fundamental and critical process in clinical psychiatry, based on well-established criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). The problem is factually and scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated and provides sufficient clinical data to formulate a differential diagnosis and determine the appropriate immediate diagnostic course. The question is specific and asks for the correct application of diagnostic principles in an acute setting. A unique, correct answer can be derived from the application of standard diagnostic criteria.\n3.  **Objective**: The description of the patient's presentation and history is factual and presented in objective clinical language. It is free of ambiguity, bias, or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-formed question that tests the application of established psychiatric diagnostic principles to a realistic clinical scenario.\n\n### Step 3: Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed to derive the solution and evaluate the options.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Diagnostic Approach\n\nThe problem requires the application of standard diagnostic criteria, as found in the DSM-5, to differentiate Stimulant Intoxication from Stimulant Use Disorder.\n\n**Analysis of Stimulant Intoxication:**\nThe DSM-5 criteria for Stimulant Intoxication are:\nA. Recent use of a stimulant (e.g., cocaine).\nB. Clinically significant problematic behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., euphoria, hypervigilance, agitation, impaired judgment) that developed during or shortly after use.\nC. Two or more physiological signs developing during or shortly after use (e.g., tachycardia, pupillary dilation, elevated blood pressure, perspiration, chest pain, psychomotor agitation).\nD. The symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition.\n\nLet's evaluate the patient against these criteria:\n-   **Criterion A**: Met. The patient reports using a \"white powder\" $2$ hours prior, and the urine drug screen is positive for cocaine metabolites.\n-   **Criterion B**: Met. The patient exhibits euphoria, hypervigilance, psychomotor agitation, and impaired judgment.\n-   **Criterion C**: Met. The patient displays tachycardia (HR $128$), pupillary dilation ($6$ mm), elevated blood pressure ($164/96$ mmHg), perspiration (diaphoresis), chest tightness (a form of chest pain), and psychomotor agitation. This far exceeds the requirement for two signs.\n-   **Criterion D**: Met. The presentation is classic for stimulant effects. Other immediate causes are less likely given the history, and some have been ruled out (e.g., normal glucose).\n\n**Conclusion**: The diagnosis of Stimulant Intoxication is unequivocally met and should be made at this time.\n\n**Analysis of Stimulant Use Disorder:**\nThe DSM-5 diagnosis of a Substance Use Disorder requires a problematic pattern of use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, manifested by at least two of eleven specific criteria occurring within a $12$-month period. The severity is graded by the number of criteria met: mild ($2$-$3$ criteria), moderate ($4$-$5$ criteria), or severe ($\\ge 6$ criteria).\n\nLet's evaluate the patient against the criteria based on the available history:\n1.  **Impaired Control (4 criteria)**: There is no evidence of use in larger amounts/longer than intended, unsuccessful efforts to cut down, excessive time spent on the substance, or craving (which the patient explicitly denies).\n2.  **Social Impairment (3 criteria)**: Collateral information explicitly refutes failure to fulfill major role obligations (job loss was unrelated), and there is no report of social/interpersonal problems or giving up activities due to use.\n3.  **Risky Use (2 criteria)**: Collateral information denies knowledge of hazardous use. While presenting to an ED with chest pain after use could constitute a \"physical problem,\" the criterion requires *continued use despite knowledge of having a problem*. This is the first such known event, so this criterion is not yet met.\n4.  **Pharmacological Criteria (2 criteria)**: Tolerance is not mentioned. Withdrawal is explicitly denied.\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on the extensive history provided, the patient meets $0$ of the $11$ criteria for Stimulant Use Disorder. Therefore, this diagnosis cannot be made at this time. Making this diagnosis requires a longitudinal history demonstrating a pathological pattern, which is absent here. The severity of an acute intoxication episode does not determine the presence or severity of a use disorder.\n\n**Synthesized Diagnostic Approach:**\nThe correct approach is to diagnose Stimulant Intoxication based on the acute presentation. The diagnosis of Stimulant Use Disorder should be deferred. A definitive assessment for a use disorder requires a more thorough longitudinal history, but the information currently available argues against the diagnosis. It is a common and critical error to conflate acute intoxication, even if severe, with a substance use disorder.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Diagnose stimulant intoxication now because there is recent use with characteristic behavioral and physiological effects emerging during or soon after ingestion; defer any stimulant use disorder diagnosis unless longitudinal data document at least $2$ of the defined criteria clustered within a $12$-month period causing clinically significant impairment or distress, with severity based on the number of criteria met rather than on acute intoxication signs.**\nThis option accurately reflects the diagnostic process derived above. It correctly identifies that the criteria for stimulant intoxication are met. It correctly states the requirements for a stimulant use disorder diagnosis (a longitudinal pattern over a $12$-month period with $\\ge 2$ criteria) and correctly notes that severity is based on the criterion count, not the signs of acute intoxication. It correctly advises deferring the use disorder diagnosis.\n**Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. Diagnose stimulant use disorder now because presentation with intoxication implies a maladaptive pattern; assign severity according to the number of current intoxication signs and vital sign abnormalities, as these reflect physiological dependence.**\nThis option contains several fundamental errors. First, a single episode of intoxication does not imply a use disorder. Second, the severity of a use disorder is not determined by the severity of intoxication. Third, acute sympathomimetic effects are not the same as physiological dependence (tolerance and withdrawal).\n**Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. Defer any diagnosis of stimulant intoxication until a confirmatory gas chromatography–mass spectrometry test returns; a positive screening immunoassay alone is insufficient, and without laboratory confirmation stimulant use disorder should be diagnosed based on the current emergency presentation.**\nThis option is incorrect. Stimulant intoxication is a clinical diagnosis based on history and physical exam; a lab test is confirmatory but not essential to make the diagnosis for immediate management. Deferring the diagnosis would be inappropriate. The second clause presents a false and illogical choice, incorrectly suggesting a use disorder diagnosis is a default if intoxication is not confirmed by a specific test.\n**Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. Diagnose stimulant-induced psychotic disorder rather than intoxication because severe agitation indicates a primary substance-induced psychiatric condition; stimulant use disorder can be ruled out in the absence of withdrawal, which is required for that diagnosis.**\nThis option is incorrect. The patient's symptoms (agitation, hypervigilance) are core features of intoxication, not necessarily psychosis. A diagnosis of stimulant-induced psychotic disorder requires prominent hallucinations or delusions, which are not described in the vignette. Furthermore, withdrawal is not a required criterion for a stimulant use disorder diagnosis; only two of eleven possible criteria are needed.\n**Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. Make a provisional dual diagnosis of stimulant intoxication and mild stimulant use disorder because any history of more than one intoxication episode within $12$ months satisfies the minimum time criterion for a use disorder regardless of functional consequences or persistent control problems.**\nThis option is incorrect because it misrepresents the criteria for a substance use disorder. Multiple episodes of intoxication within a $12$-month period do not, in themselves, constitute a use disorder. The diagnosis requires that the pattern of use leads to \"clinically significant impairment or distress\" as manifested by the specific DSM-5 criteria, which explicitly concern functional consequences and loss of control.

The relevant definitions for this problem are:\n\n1.  **Early Remission:** This specifier applies after full criteria for a substance use disorder were previously met, but none of the criteria for the substance use disorder have been met for at least $3$ months but for less than $12$ months. The exception is that Criterion A11, \"Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the substance,\" may be met.\n\n2.  **Sustained Remission:** This specifier applies after full criteria for a substance use disorder were previously met, but none of the criteria for the substance use disorder have been met at any time during a period of $12$ months or longer. The exception is that Criterion A11, \"Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use the substance,\" may be met.\n\n3.  **In a Controlled Environment:** This specifier is used if the individual is in an environment where access to the substance is restricted (e.g., a locked hospital unit, jail, or locked therapeutic community). This specifier is applied based on the individual's *current* situation.\n\n### Application to the Patient's Case\n\nThe task is to apply these definitions to the patient's clinical course over the last $12$ months to determine his status today ($t=0$).\n\n1.  **Identify the most recent time the patient met criteria for Stimulant Use Disorder.**\n    The patient has an established diagnosis of severe methamphetamine use disorder from $18$ months ago. We must examine the timeline to find the last point at which he met diagnostic criteria (other than craving).\n    - From $t=-12$ to $t=-10$ months, he was in jail and did not use. He met no criteria other than craving.\n    - At $t \\approx -9$ months, he had a single evening of use. The problem explicitly states that he did not meet other criteria: \"did not use in larger amounts or over a longer period than he intended\" (negating Criterion $1$), \"did not spend a great deal of time obtaining or recovering\" (negating Criterion $3$), \"did not miss work\" (negating Criterion $5$), and \"did not experience social or occupational impairment\" (negating Criteria $6$ and $7$). A single use episode, without other associated symptoms, does not constitute a relapse meeting diagnostic criteria. Craving was present, which is one criterion, but a diagnosis requires a pattern of at least two criteria.\n    - At $t \\approx -6.5$ months, he had a weekend binge spanning $2$ days. During this episode, he met several criteria:\n        - \"used more than intended\" (Criterion $1$: impaired control).\n        - \"missed work on Monday\" (Criterion $5$: failure to fulfill major role obligations).\n        - \"argued with his partner about his use\" (Criterion $6$: continued use despite social/interpersonal problems).\n        - \"spent substantial time obtaining and recovering from stimulants\" (Criterion $3$: time-consuming nature of use).\n    This episode at $t \\approx -6.5$ months is the most recent time the patient clearly met multiple criteria for stimulant use disorder.\n\n2.  **Calculate the duration of remission.**\n    Today is $t=0$. The last time criteria (other than craving) were met was at $t=-6.5$ months. The duration from that point until today is $6.5$ months. During this period (from $t=-6.5$ months to $t=0$), the patient has not met any criteria for stimulant use disorder, with the exception of occasional craving, which is explicitly permitted by the remission definitions.\n\n3.  **Apply the remission specifier.**\n    The duration of $6.5$ months is greater than or equal to $3$ months and less than $12$ months. This perfectly matches the definition of **Early Remission**. He does not qualify for Sustained Remission, which requires a minimum of $12$ months.\n\n4.  **Apply the \"in a controlled environment\" specifier.**\n    This specifier describes the patient's *current* environment. The problem states that from $t=-2$ months to today, the patient \"has lived at home in the community\". A private home in the community is not considered a controlled environment where access to substances is restricted. While he was in controlled environments in the past (jail from $t=-12$ to $-10$ months; locked residential treatment from $t=-5$ to $-2$ months), this specifier applies to his present circumstances. Therefore, the \"in a controlled environment\" specifier **does not** apply.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    Based on the DSM-5-TR definitions, the patient's current status is best described as \"In Early Remission.\" No other specifiers apply.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A. Early remission only**\n    This option aligns perfectly with our derivation. The patient has met no criteria (except craving) for $6.5$ months, fulfilling the $3-12$ month window for Early Remission. He is not currently in a controlled environment.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Sustained remission only**\n    Sustained remission requires a minimum of $12$ months of fulfilling remission criteria. The patient has only done so for $6.5$ months.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C.
