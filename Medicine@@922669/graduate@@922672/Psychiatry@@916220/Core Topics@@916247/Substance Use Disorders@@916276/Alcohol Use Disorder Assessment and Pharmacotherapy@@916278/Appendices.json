This practice challenges you to apply the principle of equipotent dosing to consolidate a patient's exposure to multiple agents into a single, clinically meaningful metric: the total diazepam-equivalent dose. Mastering this calculation is a fundamental skill for assessing treatment intensity, planning a smooth taper, and communicating clinical status clearly.

The principle of equipotent dosing, as defined by the provided conversion relationships and the assumption of linearity, allows us to convert the dose of each administered drug into an equivalent dose of a reference drug, in this case, diazepam. The total equivalent dose is the sum of these individual conversions.\n\nLet $D_L$, $D_C$, and $D_O$ be the total doses of lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and oxazepam administered over the past $24$ hours, respectively. The given values are:\n- $D_L = 7 \\text{ mg}$\n- $D_C = 90 \\text{ mg}$\n- $D_O = 50 \\text{ mg}$\n\nThe problem provides the following approximate dose equivalences:\n$$10 \\text{ mg diazepam} \\approx 2 \\text{ mg lorazepam} \\approx 25 \\text{ mg chlordiazepoxide} \\approx 30 \\text{ mg oxazepam}$$\n\nThe assumptions of proportionality and linearity allow us to establish conversion factors to transform a dose of a given benzodiazepine into its equipotent dose of diazepam. Let $E_{Diaz}$ denote a diazepam-equivalent dose.\n\nFirst, we define a conversion factor, $C_{X \\to Diaz}$, which converts a dose of drug $X$ to its diazepam equivalent. This factor is derived from the ratio of the equipotent doses of diazepam and drug $X$.\n\nFor lorazepam ($L$), the equivalence is $10 \\text{ mg diazepam} \\approx 2 \\text{ mg lorazepam}$. The conversion factor from lorazepam to diazepam is:\n$$C_{L \\to Diaz} = \\frac{10 \\text{ mg diazepam}}{2 \\text{ mg lorazepam}} = 5$$\nThe diazepam-equivalent dose for $D_L = 7 \\text{ mg}$ of lorazepam, denoted as $E_L$, is calculated as:\n$$E_L = D_L \\times C_{L \\to Diaz} = 7 \\text{ mg} \\times 5 = 35 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nFor chlordiazepoxide ($C$), the equivalence is $10 \\text{ mg diazepam} \\approx 25 \\text{ mg chlordiazepoxide}$. The conversion factor is:\n$$C_{C \\to Diaz} = \\frac{10 \\text{ mg diazepam}}{25 \\text{ mg chlordiazepoxide}} = 0.4$$\nThe diazepam-equivalent dose for $D_C = 90 \\text{ mg}$ of chlordiazepoxide, denoted as $E_C$, is:\n$$E_C = D_C \\times C_{C \\to Diaz} = 90 \\text{ mg} \\times 0.4 = 36 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nFor oxazepam ($O$), the equivalence is $10 \\text{ mg diazepam} \\approx 30 \\text{ mg oxazepam}$. The conversion factor is:\n$$C_{O \\to Diaz} = \\frac{10 \\text{ mg diazepam}}{30 \\text{ mg oxazepam}} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThe diazepam-equivalent dose for $D_O = 50 \\text{ mg}$ of oxazepam, denoted as $E_O$, is:\n$$E_O = D_O \\times C_{O \\to Diaz} = 50 \\text{ mg} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{50}{3} \\text{ mg}$$\n\nThe assumption of linearity implies that the total diazepam-equivalent dose, $E_{Total}$, is the arithmetic sum of the individual equivalent doses:\n$$E_{Total} = E_L + E_C + E_O$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$E_{Total} = 35 \\text{ mg} + 36 \\text{ mg} + \\frac{50}{3} \\text{ mg}$$\n$$E_{Total} = 71 \\text{ mg} + \\frac{50}{3} \\text{ mg}$$\nTo perform the addition, we use a common denominator:\n$$E_{Total} = \\frac{71 \\times 3}{3} \\text{ mg} + \\frac{50}{3} \\text{ mg} = \\frac{213}{3} \\text{ mg} + \\frac{50}{3} \\text{ mg} = \\frac{263}{3} \\text{ mg}$$\nAs a decimal, this is:\n$$E_{Total} = 87.666... \\text{ mg}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$E_{Total} \\approx 87.7 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nClinical Caveats:\nAlthough the numerical calculation is straightforward, applying such equivalences in a clinical setting requires significant caution. The concept of \"equipotency\" is an oversimplification that primarily considers peak pharmacodynamic effect (e.g., sedation, anxiolysis) but ignores crucial pharmacokinetic differences between agents.\n\n1.  **Pharmacokinetic Profiles**: The administered drugs have different pharmacokinetic properties. Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are long-acting benzodiazepines with long-acting active metabolites (e.g., nordiazepam), leading to half-lives that can exceed $100$ hours. This results in drug accumulation with repeated dosing, which, while beneficial for maintaining a stable level of sedation and preventing breakthrough withdrawal symptoms, increases the risk of over-sedation, respiratory depression, and cognitive impairment, particularly in later stages of treatment. In contrast, lorazepam has an intermediate half-life (approx. $10-20$ hours) and oxazepam has a short-to-intermediate half-life (approx. $4-15$ hours). Neither has significant active metabolites. Switching a patient from a regimen of shorter-acting agents to a calculated \"equivalent\" dose of a long-acting agent like diazepam will produce a very different clinical effect over time.\n\n2.  **Metabolism and Patient-Specific Factors**: Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide are metabolized via hepatic oxidation (cytochrome P450 system), a pathway that can be significantly impaired in patients with liver disease (common in alcohol use disorder) and in the elderly. Lorazepam and oxazepam are metabolized via glucuronidation, a process that is generally preserved in liver disease and less affected by age. Therefore, for a patient with compromised liver function, switching to an \"equivalent\" dose of diazepam based on these tables could be dangerous and lead to toxic accumulation.\n\n3.  **Onset of Action**: The onset of action differs among agents and routes of administration, which affects their utility in managing acute agitation. The conversion does not account for how these drugs were administered (e.g., intravenously vs. orally) or the temporal pattern of administration over the $24$-hour period.\n\nIn summary, dose-equivalence tables are useful as a preliminary guide for gauging the total benzodiazepine exposure or for initiating a switch between agents. However, they are not a substitute for clinical judgment. The choice of agent and dose must be individualized based on the patient’s clinical status, age, comorbidities (especially liver function), and the specific goals of treatment (e.g., rapid control of acute agitation vs. smooth, prolonged prevention of withdrawal). Symptom-triggered treatment protocols, where doses are administered based on validated withdrawal scales, are often preferred over fixed-dose schedules precisely because they allow for real-time titration to effect, mitigating the risks associated with pharmacokinetic variability and rigid dose conversions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{87.7}$$", "id": "4685826"}, {"introduction": "Transitioning a patient from acute withdrawal management to long-term relapse prevention requires careful medication selection and dosing.
