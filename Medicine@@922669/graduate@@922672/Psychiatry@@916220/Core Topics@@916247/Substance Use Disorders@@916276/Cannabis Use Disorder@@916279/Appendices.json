It introduces a standardized unit (SCU) for quantifying a substance, a common practice in health sciences (e.g., the concept of a standard drink of alcohol). The explicitly stated directive to ignore route-specific pharmacokinetics simplifies the problem to a deterministic calculation based on mass, which is a valid pedagogical approach for constructing a word problem. The values provided are realistic for commercial products.\n    - The problem is well-posed. All necessary information and definitions are provided for a unique solution to be determined.\n    - The problem is objective. The language is precise and free of bias or subjective claims.\n\n- **Verdict:** The problem is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe objective is to calculate the ratio $R$, defined as the number of Standard Cannabis Units (SCUs) in the joint divided by the number of SCUs in the edible.\n\nLet the variable $N_{joint}$ denote the number of SCUs in the joint and $N_{edible}$ denote the number of SCUs in the edible. The ratio is given by the expression:\n$$\nR = \\frac{N_{joint}}{N_{edible}}\n$$\n\nThe definition of an SCU is based on the mass of THC. Let the constant $M_{SCU}$ represent the mass of THC in one SCU, which is given as $5$ mg.\n$$\nM_{SCU} = 5 \\text{ mg}\n$$\nThe number of SCUs in any product, which we can denote by $N_{SCU}$, is the total mass of THC in that product, $M_{THC}$, divided by $M_{SCU}$:\n$$\nN_{SCU} = \\frac{M_{THC}}{M_{SCU}}\n$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of SCUs in the joint, $N_{joint}$. The mass of cannabis in the joint is given as $m_{joint} = 0.5$ g. The potency of THC is given as a mass fraction, $p_{THC}$, which is $20\\%$. For calculation, this percentage must be expressed as the decimal $0.20$.\nThe total mass of THC in the joint, $M_{THC, joint}$, is the product of the cannabis mass and the potency:\n$$\nM_{THC, joint} = m_{joint} \\times p_{THC} = 0.5 \\text{ g} \\times 0.20 = 0.1 \\text{ g}\n$$\nThe SCU definition is based on a mass in milligrams (mg), so we must convert the mass of THC from grams (g) to milligrams. Using the conversion factor $1 \\text{ g} = 1000 \\text{ mg}$:\n$$\nM_{THC, joint} = 0.1 \\text{ g} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ mg}}{1 \\text{ g}} = 100 \\text{ mg}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the number of SCUs in the joint by dividing the total THC mass by the mass per SCU:\n$$\nN_{joint} = \\frac{M_{THC, joint}}{M_{SCU}} = \\frac{100 \\text{ mg}}{5 \\text{ mg}} = 20\n$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the number of SCUs in the edible, $N_{edible}$. The problem states that the labeled THC content for the edible serving is given directly as $M_{THC, edible} = 10$ mg.\nThe number of SCUs in the edible is therefore:\n$$\nN_{edible} = \\frac{M_{THC, edible}}{M_{SCU}} = \\frac{10 \\text{ mg}}{5 \\text{ mg}} = 2\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the required ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{N_{joint}}{N_{edible}} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10\n$$\nThe ratio $R$ is an exact real number. This result indicates that, based on the defined SCU standard, the joint contains $10$ times the number of SCUs as the edible.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{10}\n$$", "id": "4696500"}, {"introduction": "The amount of THC administered is not the same as the amount that reaches the brain. This practice advances from simple content calculation to estimating systemic exposure by incorporating the crucial pharmacokinetic principle of bioavailability, which differs significantly by route of administration.

We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe primary objective is to derive an expression for the total weekly systemic load of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), denoted as $L_{\\text{sys,week}}$, and then to compute its numerical value based on the provided patient data. This total load is the sum of the systemic exposure from two routes of administration: inhalation and oral ingestion.\n\nLet us define the components of the total load. The weekly systemic load from inhalation, $L_{\\text{inh,sys,week}}$, and the weekly systemic load from oral ingestion, $L_{\\text{oral,sys,week}}$, are summed to find the total:\n$$L_{\\text{sys,week}} = L_{\\text{inh,sys,week}} + L_{\\text{oral,sys,week}}$$\n\nFirst, we address the inhaled component. The mass of THC administered daily via inhalation, $D_{\\text{inh,admin,day}}$, is determined by the mass of the flower consumed per day, $m_{\\text{flower,day}}$, and the mass fraction of THC in the flower, $w_{\\text{THC}}$. The problem states the flower has $18\\%$ total THC potential, which we interpret as a mass fraction $w_{\\text{THC}} = 0.18$.\nTherefore, the administered daily dose from inhalation is:\n$$D_{\\text{inh,admin,day}} = m_{\\text{flower,day}} \\times w_{\\text{THC}}$$\nThe systemic dose is the fraction of the administered dose that reaches systemic circulation, which is determined by the bioavailability, $F$. For the inhaled route, the systemic bioavailability is given as $F_{\\text{inh}} = 0.25$. The daily systemic dose from inhalation, $D_{\\text{inh,sys,day}}$, is:\n$$D_{\\text{inh,sys,day}} = D_{\\text{inh,admin,day}} \\times F_{\\text{inh}} = (m_{\\text{flower,day}} \\times w_{\\text{THC}}) \\times F_{\\text{inh}}$$\nThe patient uses cannabis daily, so the number of days of use per week is $N_{\\text{days,week}} = 7$. The total weekly systemic load from inhalation is:\n$$L_{\\text{inh,sys,week}} = D_{\\text{inh,sys,day}} \\times N_{\\text{days,week}} = (m_{\\text{flower,day}} \\times w_{\\text{THC}} \\times F_{\\text{inh}}) \\times N_{\\text{days,week}}$$\n\nSecond, we address the oral component. The patient consumes $N_{\\text{edibles,week}} = 2$ edibles per week, each with an administered dose of $D_{\\text{oral,admin}} = 10 \\text{ mg}$ of THC. The oral bioavailability is given as $F_{\\text{oral}} = 0.10$. The systemic dose from a single edible is:\n$$D_{\\text{oral,sys,edible}} = D_{\\text{oral,admin}} \\times F_{\\text{oral}}$$\nThe total weekly systemic load from oral ingestion is:\n$$L_{\\text{oral,sys,week}} = D_{\\text{oral,sys,edible}} \\times N_{\\text{edibles,week}} = (D_{\\text{oral,admin}} \\times F_{\\text{oral}}) \\times N_{\\text{edibles,week}}$$\n\nCombining these two components, the general expression for the total weekly systemic THC load is:\n$$L_{\\text{sys,week}} = (m_{\\text{flower,day}} \\times w_{\\text{THC}} \\times F_{\\text{inh}} \\times N_{\\text{days,week}}) + (D_{\\text{oral,admin}} \\times F_{\\text{oral}} \\times N_{\\text{edibles,week}})$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values. It is critical to ensure unit consistency. The final answer is requested in milligrams (mg). The daily flower mass is given as $m_{\\text{flower,day}} = 0.3 \\text{ g}$. We convert this to milligrams: $m_{\\text{flower,day}} = 0.3 \\text{ g} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ mg}}{1 \\text{ g}} = 300 \\text{ mg}$.\nThe other parameters are:\n$w_{\\text{THC}} = 0.18$\n$F_{\\text{inh}} = 0.25$\n$N_{\\text{days,week}} = 7$\n$D_{\\text{oral,admin}} = 10 \\text{ mg}$\n$F_{\\text{oral}} = 0.10$\n$N_{\\text{edibles,week}} = 2$\n\nFirst, calculate the weekly systemic load from inhalation:\n$$L_{\\text{inh,sys,week}} = (300 \\text{ mg} \\times 0.18 \\times 0.25) \\times 7 = (54 \\text{ mg} \\times 0.25) \\times 7 = 13.5 \\text{ mg} \\times 7 = 94.5 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nNext, calculate the weekly systemic load from oral ingestion:\n$$L_{\\text{oral,sys,week}} = (10 \\text{ mg} \\times 0.10) \\times 2 = 1 \\text{ mg} \\times 2 = 2 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nFinally, the total weekly systemic THC load is the sum of the two components:\n$$L_{\\text{sys,week}} = 94.5 \\text{ mg} + 2 \\text{ mg} = 96.5 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures. The calculated value $96.5$ already has three significant figures.\n\nQualitative Interpretation:\nA total weekly systemic THC load of $96.5 \\text{ mg}$, primarily driven by a consistent daily systemic exposure of approximately $13.5 \\text{ mg}$ from inhalation, has significant implications for neuroadaptation and the risk of developing Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD).\n\n1.  **Tolerance:** The cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor, the primary molecular target for THC's psychoactive effects, undergoes significant homeostatic changes in response to chronic agonism. Continuous exposure, as quantified by this daily systemic load, leads to receptor downregulation (a decrease in receptor density) and desensitization (a reduction in signaling efficacy). This neuroadaptation is the basis of pharmacological tolerance, where progressively higher doses are required to achieve the initial desired effects. The calculated exposure level is well above the threshold typically associated with the development of robust tolerance.\n\n2.  **Withdrawal Risk:** The same neuroadaptive processes that cause tolerance are responsible for the cannabis withdrawal syndrome upon cessation or significant reduction of use. The brain, having adapted to the constant presence of an exogenous agonist, exists in a new allostatic state. Removal of THC unmasks this state, leading to symptoms such as irritability, anxiety, insomnia, depressed mood, and decreased appetite. The patient's daily exposure pattern establishes a high probability of experiencing a clinically significant withdrawal syndrome, a key criterion for CUD in the DSM-5.\n\n3.  **Progression to Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD):** CUD is a psychiatric diagnosis characterized by a pattern of problematic cannabis use leading to impairment or distress. The DSM-5 criteria include tolerance (Criterion 10) and withdrawal (Criterion 11), both of which are highly probable given the calculated systemic load. The patient's daily use pattern may satisfy other criteria such as \"cannabis is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended\" (Criterion 1) and \"a great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain, use, or recover from cannabis effects\" (Criterion 3). This quantitative analysis provides an objective pharmacokinetic basis for the high risk of CUD, framing the patient's use not merely as a habit but as a level of physiological exposure sufficient to drive the core biological components of a substance use disorder. The substantial dominance of the inhaled route ($94.5 \\text{ mg}$ vs. $2 \\text{ mg}$) points to the daily inhalation as the principal driver of this risk.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{96.5}$$", "id": "4696536"}, {"introduction": "Screening instruments are fundamental to identifying individuals at risk for Cannabis Use Disorder in clinical settings, but their utility depends on selecting an appropriate cutoff score.

A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe evaluation of a diagnostic test's performance requires classifying outcomes into a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table. Let $D^+$ denote the event that an individual has the disease (cannabis use disorder) and $D^-$ denote the event that they do not. Let $T^+$ denote a positive test result (score $\\ge c$) and $T^-$ denote a negative test result (score < $c$). The counts of individuals in each category are:\n- $N_{TP}$: True Positives (correctly identified as having the disease, $D^+$ and $T^+$).\n- $N_{FN}$: False Negatives (incorrectly identified as not having the disease, $D^+$ and $T^-$).\n- $N_{FP}$: False Positives (incorrectly identified as having the disease, $D^-$ and $T^+$).\n- $N_{TN}$: True Negatives (correctly identified as not having the disease, $D^-$ and $T^-$).\n\nThe total number of diseased individuals is $N_{D^+} = N_{TP} + N_{FN}$, and the total number of non-diseased individuals is $N_{D^-} = N_{FP} + N_{TN}$.\n\n**Sensitivity** (or True Positive Rate, TPR) is the conditional probability of a positive test result given that the individual has the disease. It measures the test's ability to correctly identify those with the disease. Its formula is:\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = P(T^+ | D^+) = \\frac{N_{TP}}{N_{TP} + N_{FN}} = \\frac{N_{TP}}{N_{D^+}} $$\n\n**Specificity** (or True Negative Rate, TNR) is the conditional probability of a negative test result given that the individual does not have the disease. It measures the test's ability to correctly identify those without the disease. Its formula is:\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = P(T^- | D^-) = \\frac{N_{TN}}{N_{FP} + N_{TN}} = \\frac{N_{TN}}{N_{D^-}} $$\n\n**Youden's index ($J$)** is a single statistic that captures the performance of a dichotomous diagnostic test. It is the vertical distance from the chance line to the point on the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and is defined as:\n$$ J = \\text{Sensitivity} + \\text{Specificity} - 1 $$\nThe optimal cutoff is the one that maximizes $J$.\n\nWe now apply these definitions to the two specified cutoffs.\n\n### Analysis for Cutoff $c=8$\nThe given counts are:\n- $N_{D^+} = 60$, with $N_{TP,8} = 52$ and $N_{FN,8} = 8$.\n- $N_{D^-} = 90$, with $N_{FP,8} = 20$ and $N_{TN,8} = 70$.\n\nThe sensitivity at $c=8$ is:\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity}_8 = \\frac{N_{TP,8}}{N_{D^+}} = \\frac{52}{60} = \\frac{13}{15} \\approx 0.86666... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\text{Sensitivity}_8 = 0.8667$.\n\nThe specificity at $c=8$ is:\n$$ \\text{Specificity}_8 = \\frac{N_{TN,8}}{N_{D^-}} = \\frac{70}{90} = \\frac{7}{9} \\approx 0.77777... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\text{Specificity}_8 = 0.7778$.\n\nYouden's index at $c=8$ is calculated using the exact fractions to avoid premature rounding error:\n$$ J_8 = \\text{Sensitivity}_8 + \\text{Specificity}_8 - 1 = \\frac{13}{15} + \\frac{7}{9} - 1 = \\frac{39}{45} + \\frac{35}{45} - \\frac{45}{45} = \\frac{39+35-45}{45} = \\frac{29}{45} \\approx 0.64444... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $J_8 = 0.6444$.\n\n### Analysis for Cutoff $c=13$\nThe given counts are:\n- $N_{D^+} = 60$, with $N_{TP,13} = 40$ and $N_{FN,13} = 20$.\n- $N_{D^-} = 90$, with $N_{FP,13} = 8$ and $N_{TN,13} = 82$.\n\nThe sensitivity at $c=13$ is:\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity}_{13} = \\frac{N_{TP,13}}{N_{D^+}} = \\frac{40}{60} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.66666... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\text{Sensitivity}_{13} = 0.6667$.\n\nThe specificity at $c=13$ is:\n$$ \\text{Specificity}_{13} = \\frac{N_{TN,13}}{N_{D^-}} = \\frac{82}{90} = \\frac{41}{45} \\approx 0.91111... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\text{Specificity}_{13} = 0.9111$.\n\nYouden's index at $c=13$ is:\n$$ J_{13} = \\text{Sensitivity}_{13} + \\text{Specificity}_{13} - 1 = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{41}{45} - 1 = \\frac{30}{45} + \\frac{41}{45} - \\frac{45}{45} = \\frac{30+41-45}{45} = \\frac{26}{45} \\approx 0.57777... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $J_{13} = 0.5778$.\n\n### Selection of the Optimal Cutoff\nTo select the optimal cutoff, we compare the Youden's indices:\n- $J_8 = 0.6444$\n- $J_{13} = 0.5778$\n\nSince $J_8 > J_{13}$, the cutoff $c=8$ provides a better balance between sensitivity and specificity as measured by Youden's index.
