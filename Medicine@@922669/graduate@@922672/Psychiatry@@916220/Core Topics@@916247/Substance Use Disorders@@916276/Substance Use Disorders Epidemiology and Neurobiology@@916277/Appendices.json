Over the past $12$ months, he has drunk alcohol at home on most weeknights. He often plans to have $1$–$2$ drinks but finds himself finishing $6$–$7$ and staying up later than intended. Since January, he has made multiple attempts to restrict drinking to weekends and to limit to $2$ drinks, but each attempt has lasted less than $2$ weeks before returning to prior patterns. He reports strong urges to drink in the late afternoon near the end of the workday. One month ago, after a work dinner, he drove himself home after consuming approximately $5$ drinks. In the past $3$ months, he has missed two early-morning client meetings due to oversleeping after drinking and received a written warning from his supervisor. His partner has complained repeatedly over the past $6$ months that his drinking is causing arguments and tension at home, but he has continued to drink. Compared with two years ago, he now requires $5$–$6$ drinks to achieve the same buzz that $2$–$3$ drinks previously produced. He denies tremor, insomnia, nausea, anxiety, or other withdrawal symptoms in the past $12$ months; he recalls morning shakiness if he skipped drinking about $18$ months ago. He buys alcohol during routine grocery trips, keeps it at home, and typically drinks for about $45$ minutes on evenings when he drinks; aside from the two missed mornings, he denies spending a great deal of time recovering from alcohol’s effects.

The severity is graded as mild ($2$–$3$ criteria), moderate ($4$–$5$ criteria), or severe ($6$ or more criteria). We will evaluate each of the $11$ criteria based on the provided case information for the past $12$ months.\n\n1.  **Alcohol taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than intended:** The patient \"often plans to have $1$–$2$ drinks but finds himself finishing $6$–$7$ and staying up later than intended.\" This criterion is **MET**.\n\n2.  **Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use:** The patient \"has made multiple attempts to restrict drinking...but each attempt has lasted less than $2$ weeks before returning to prior patterns.\" This criterion is **MET**.\n\n3.  **A great deal of time is spent in activities to obtain, use, or recover from alcohol:** The text states, \"He buys alcohol during routine grocery trips...and typically drinks for about $45$ minutes on evenings when he drinks\". It also explicitly notes he \"denies spending a great deal of time recovering from alcohol’s effects.\" The evidence provided argues against meeting this criterion. This criterion is **NOT MET**.\n\n4.  **Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol:** The patient \"reports strong urges to drink in the late afternoon near the end of the workday.\" This criterion is **MET**.\n\n5.  **Recurrent use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations:** The patient \"has missed two early-morning client meetings due to oversleeping after drinking and received a written warning from his supervisor.\" This represents a clear failure in a major work role obligation. This criterion is **MET**.\n\n6.  **Continued use despite persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems:** The patient’s \"partner has complained repeatedly over the past 6 months that his drinking is causing arguments and tension at home, but he has continued to drink.\" This criterion is **MET**.\n\n7.  **Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced:** The patient \"continues his weekly recreational soccer league.\" No evidence is provided that any activities have been given up or reduced. This criterion is **NOT MET**.\n\n8.  **Recurrent use in situations in which it is physically hazardous:** The patient \"drove himself home after consuming approximately $5$ drinks.\" Driving while intoxicated is a classic example of physically hazardous use. This criterion is **MET**.\n\n9.  **Continued use despite knowledge of having a persistent physical or psychological problem caused or exacerbated by alcohol:** Liver enzymes were normal in the past year, so there is no known, persistent physical problem. The interpersonal problems are accounted for by criterion $6$. This criterion is **NOT MET**.\n\n10. **Tolerance:** The patient \"now requires $5$–$6$ drinks to achieve the same buzz that $2$–$3$ drinks previously produced.\" This is the definition of tolerance. This criterion is **MET**.\n\n11. **Withdrawal:** The patient \"denies tremor, insomnia, nausea, anxiety, or other withdrawal symptoms in the past $12$ months.\" The episode of shakiness was $18$ months ago and is outside the diagnostic window. This criterion is **NOT MET**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Criteria met: $1$, $2$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $8$, and $10$.\n- Total number of criteria met: $7$.\n- Since $7$ is greater than or equal to $6$, the DSM-5 severity classification is **Severe**.\n\nTherefore, the correct diagnosis is Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe, with $7$ criteria met.

Interpretation of the Association**\nAll three metrics ($RR=2.000 > 1$, $OR=2.429 > 1$, $RD=0.1500 > 0$) indicate a positive association, meaning low striatal $D2/3$ availability is a risk factor for developing stimulant use disorder.\n\n- **Relative Magnitude ($RR$ and $OR$):** The relative risk ($RR = 2.000$) indicates that individuals with low striatal $D2/3$ availability were $2$ times as likely to develop stimulant use disorder over the $3$-year period compared to those with normal/higher availability. The odds ratio ($OR = 2.429$) indicates that the odds of developing the disorder were approximately $2.43$ times higher in the exposed group.\n- **Absolute Magnitude ($RD$):** The risk difference ($RD = 0.1500$) signifies an excess risk of $0.15$, or $15$ percentage points, attributable to low $D2/3$ availability. This means that for every $100$ individuals with low $D2/3$ availability, there were $15$ additional cases of stimulant use disorder observed over $3$ years than would have been seen in a group of $100$ individuals with normal/higher availability.

Assume continuous-time dynamics with constant transition intensities and homogeneous mixing within the cohort. Let external inflow represent incident initiators entering the cohort per unit time and uniform background mortality represent exit from all states, reflecting population turnover while preserving scientific realism.\n\nStarting from the mass-balance principle and the Kolmogorov forward framework for continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs), construct the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the compartment sizes $I(t)$, $D(t)$, $R(t)$, and $L(t)$ under the following assumptions and parameters (all rates are per year):\n\n- External inflow into initiation: $\\nu = 1000$.\n- Transition rates: $I \\to D$ at rate $\\alpha = 0.2$; $I \\to R$ at rate $\\gamma = 0.5$; $D \\to R$ at rate $\\rho = 0.3$; $R \\to L$ at rate $\\lambda = 0.4$; $L \\to D$ at rate $\\beta = 0.6$; $L \\to R$ at rate $\\sigma = 0.5$.\n- Uniform mortality from each state: $\\mu = 0.01$.\n\nUse these modeling specifications to:\n\n1.

The closed-form solutions are algebraically complex, but the system can be readily solved with the given parameters.\n\n**3. Steady-State Total Cohort Size ($N^*$**)\n\nSumming the four ODEs, all internal transition terms (e.g., $\\alpha I, \\rho D$) cancel out, leaving:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = \\frac{dI}{dt} + \\frac{dD}{dt} + \\frac{dR}{dt} + \\frac{dL}{dt} = \\nu - \\mu I - \\mu D - \\mu R - \\mu L = \\nu - \\mu N $$\nAt steady state, $\\frac{dN}{dt} = 0$, which gives $0 = \\nu - \\mu N^*$.
