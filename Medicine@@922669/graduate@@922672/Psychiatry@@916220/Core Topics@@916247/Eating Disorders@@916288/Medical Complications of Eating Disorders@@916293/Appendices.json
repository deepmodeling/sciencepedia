The patient’s body weight is $41.3$ kilograms and, by consensus criteria, she meets “very high risk” features for refeeding syndrome (negligible intake for more than two weeks and marked weight loss). In refeeding syndrome, carbohydrate intake stimulates insulin secretion, driving intracellular shifts of phosphate, potassium, and magnesium; hypophosphatemia is a central complication that can precipitate cardiopulmonary failure.

The question is unambiguous.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using objective clinical data and standard medical terminology. It is free of subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. A definitive solution can be derived from the provided information.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe primary task is to calculate the corrected $QT$ interval ($QTc$) and use this value, in a clinical context, to make a decision regarding hospitalization.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the QTc Interval**\n\nFirst, the measurements given in \"small squares\" must be converted into units of time (seconds). Standard $ECG$ paper is calibrated such that at a speed of $25 \\ \\mathrm{mm/s}$, one small square ($1 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$) corresponds to a specific duration.\nThe time duration, $T_{sq}$, of one small square is calculated as:\n$$T_{sq} = \\frac{1 \\ \\mathrm{mm}}{25 \\ \\mathrm{mm/s}} = 0.04 \\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n\nNext, we use this conversion factor to find the duration of the $R$–$R$ interval and the $QT$ interval in seconds.\nThe $R$–$R$ interval is given as $27$ small squares:\n$$R\\text{-}R \\ \\text{interval} = 27 \\ \\text{squares} \\times 0.04 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{s}}{\\text{square}} = 1.08 \\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nThe $QT$ interval is given as $13$ small squares:\n$$QT \\ \\text{interval} = 13 \\ \\text{squares} \\times 0.04 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{s}}{\\text{square}} = 0.52 \\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n\nNow, we apply Bazett's formula to calculate the heart rate–corrected $QT$ interval, $QTc$. The formula is:\n$$QTc = \\frac{QT}{\\sqrt{R\\text{-}R}}$$\nwhere both $QT$ and $R\\text{-}R$ are in seconds. The resulting $QTc$ will also be in seconds.\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$QTc = \\frac{0.52}{\\sqrt{1.08}} \\approx \\frac{0.52}{1.03923} \\approx 0.500374 \\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in milliseconds ($ms$) and rounded to four significant figures.\n$$QTc \\ \\text{(in ms)} = 0.500374 \\ \\mathrm{s} \\times 1000 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{ms}}{\\mathrm{s}} = 500.374 \\ \\mathrm{ms}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$QTc \\approx 500.4 \\ \\mathrm{ms}$$\n\n**Part 2: Clinical Decision and Justification**\n\nThe decision to hospitalize for cardiac monitoring is based on the risk of torsades de pointes ($TdP$), a life-threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which is strongly associated with a prolonged $QTc$ interval.\n\n**Risk Stratification based on QTc:**\nFor women, the generally accepted thresholds for $QTc$ are:\n- Normal: $ 460 \\ \\mathrm{ms}$\n- Borderline: $460 \\ \\mathrm{ms}$ to $480 \\ \\mathrm{ms}$\n- Prolonged: $ 480 \\ \\mathrm{ms}$\n- High Risk for $TdP$: $ 500 \\ \\mathrm{ms}$\n\nThe calculated $QTc$ of $500.4 \\ \\mathrm{ms}$ unequivocally places this patient in the high-risk category for developing $TdP$.\n\n**Justification:**\nHospitalization for continuous cardiac monitoring is strongly indicated and an urgent necessity. The justification rests on the convergence of multiple, synergistic risk factors:\n1.  **Markedly Prolonged QTc:** The primary finding of $QTc = 500.4 \\ \\mathrm{ms}$ is, by itself, a high-risk feature that often warrants inpatient monitoring.\n2.  **Severe Hypokalemia:** The patient's serum potassium is $2.8 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$ (normal range is typically $3.5$–$5.2 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$). Hypokalemia is a potent and independent risk factor for $QT$ prolongation and $TdP$. It impairs the function of the rapid delayed-rectifier potassium current ($I_{Kr}$), which is crucial for ventricular repolarization. The combination of a prolonged baseline $QT$ and hypokalemia is particularly dangerous.\n3.  **Symptomatic Presentation:** The patient is experiencing palpitations and presyncope. These symptoms could be the clinical manifestation of a non-sustained or sustained ventricular arrhythmia, suggesting that the electrical instability is already causing hemodynamic consequences.\n4.  **Female Sex:** Women have a longer baseline $QTc$ and are known to be at a higher risk for drug-induced and congenital $TdP$ compared to men.\n5.  **Underlying Condition:** Severe anorexia nervosa itself is a risk factor for cardiac complications, including myocardial atrophy ('starvation heart') and electrolyte derangements, which create a vulnerable substrate for arrhythmias. The patient's signs of volume depletion (orthostatic hypotension, dry mucous membranes) suggest significant physiological stress that can exacerbate electrolyte imbalances.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of a $QTc$ interval exceeding the $500 \\ \\mathrm{ms}$ high-risk threshold with the presence of severe hypokalemia and alarming symptoms makes the risk of a fatal arrhythmia unacceptably high.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe task is to compute the gap-gap ratio, $r$, for a patient with a mixed acid-base disorder. This requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided laboratory data.\n\nFirst, we calculate the serum anion gap ($AG$). The anion gap is defined by the principle of electroneutrality and represents the difference between the primary measured cation ($[Na^{+}]$) and the primary measured anions ($[Cl^{-}]$ and $[HCO_{3}^{-}]$):\n$$AG = [Na^{+}] - ([Cl^{-}] + [HCO_{3}^{-}]) $$\nSubstituting the patient's values:\n$$ AG = 140 - (82 + 36) = 140 - 118 = 22~\\text{mEq/L} $$\n\nThe patient's serum albumin is $2.0~\\text{g/dL}$, which is below the normal level of $4.0~\\text{g/dL}$. since albumin is a negatively charged protein, a state of hypoalbuminemia will artifactually lower the anion gap.
