Mastering this distinction [@problem_id:4692076] is fundamental for appropriate treatment planning.", "problem": "A patient assigned female at birth, age $16$, presents with an $8$-month history of postprandial epigastric discomfort and bloating. Over this interval, she has progressively limited her diet to a narrow set of “safe” foods and markedly reduced portion sizes. She reports that she often avoids eating at school or with peers due to fear that eating will precipitate severe abdominal pain and vomiting. On many occasions after meals, she deliberately induces vomiting with her fingers to “empty the stomach” and preempt anticipated pain. She denies episodes of eating unusually large amounts of food accompanied by loss of control, and she denies fear of weight gain, drive for thinness, or body-image dissatisfaction. Body mass index (BMI) is $21.3 \\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$ (approximately $55$th percentile for age), and weight has been stable over the past $6$ months. Laboratory evaluation shows ferritin $9 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$ (low) with hemoglobin $11.2 \\ \\mathrm{g/dL}$ and mean corpuscular volume $78 \\ \\mathrm{fL}$, consistent with mild iron deficiency. Comprehensive metabolic panel, celiac serologies, Helicobacter pylori testing, abdominal ultrasound, and upper endoscopy with biopsies are unremarkable. She reports significant psychosocial interference: she skips family dinners, no longer participates in team lunches, and spends extensive time planning around meals. There is no history of trauma. She is not taking laxatives, diuretics, or stimulants. There is no substance use.\n\nUsing foundational diagnostic definitions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) and the Rome $\\mathrm{IV}$ criteria for disorders of gut–brain interaction, identify the single best-fitting diagnosis among the following and the deciding features that most critically support it in this case.\n\nA. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), aversive-consequence subtype; key features are avoidance and restriction driven by fear of aversive gastrointestinal consequences (pain/vomiting), absence of weight/shape overvaluation, restricted dietary variety with associated nutritional deficiency and marked psychosocial interference despite normal BMI.\n\nB. Rumination disorder; key features are recurrent regurgitation of food with normal gastrointestinal work-up, absence of weight/shape concerns, and postprandial expulsion of ingested material.\n\nC. Functional gastrointestinal disorder (functional dyspepsia); key features are chronic epigastric pain with normal evaluation, with eating behaviors secondary to visceral hypersensitivity, making a primary psychiatric eating diagnosis unwarranted.\n\nD. Bulimia nervosa, purging type; key features are recurrent self-induced vomiting after eating consistent with purging behaviors, irrespective of BMI and stated motives.\n\nE. Specific phobia (vomiting), primary; key features are intense fear of vomiting leading to avoidance of eating, where the phobic process—not an eating or feeding disturbance—is primary, and nutritional compromise does not direct the diagnosis.", "solution": "The analysis must be grounded in core definitions from DSM-5-TR for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), rumination disorder, and bulimia nervosa, and from Rome $\\mathrm{IV}$ for functional gastrointestinal disorders. The essential, widely accepted foundations are as follows:\n\n- DSM-5-TR defines ARFID as an eating or feeding disturbance (e.g., apparent lack of interest in eating, avoidance based on sensory characteristics of food, or concern about aversive consequences of eating) that is associated with persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energy needs, manifested by at least one of the following: significant weight loss or failure to achieve expected weight gain; significant nutritional deficiency; dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements; or marked interference with psychosocial functioning. The disturbance is not better explained by lack of available food, culturally sanctioned practice, and does not occur exclusively during anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, and there is no evidence of a disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or shape is experienced. ARFID can be specified by the maintaining mechanism, including avoidance due to fear of aversive consequences (e.g., choking, vomiting, abdominal pain).\n\n- DSM-5-TR defines rumination disorder as repeated regurgitation of food, which may be re-chewed, re-swallowed, or spit out, occurring over a period of at least $1$ month, not attributable to an associated gastrointestinal or other medical condition, not occurring exclusively during anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, and if occurring within the context of another mental disorder, severe enough to warrant additional clinical attention. Phenomenologically, the regurgitation is typically effortless, not preceded by nausea or retching, and often occurs within minutes of a meal.\n\n- DSM-5-TR defines bulimia nervosa as recurrent episodes of binge eating (eating, in a discrete period, an amount of food larger than what most would eat under similar circumstances, accompanied by a sense of lack of control) and recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors (e.g., self-induced vomiting), occurring on average at least once weekly for $3$ months, with self-evaluation unduly influenced by body shape and weight. BMI is often in the normal range, but the core features include overvaluation of shape/weight and binge eating.\n\n- Rome $\\mathrm{IV}$ functional gastrointestinal disorders (disorders of gut–brain interaction) such as functional dyspepsia require chronic symptom patterns (e.g., epigastric pain, early satiety, postprandial fullness) without structural disease explaining symptoms. These diagnoses are clinical and can coexist with psychiatric conditions; however, when a primary feeding/eating disturbance drives nutritional deficiency or psychosocial impairment independent of structural gastrointestinal pathology, an eating disorder diagnosis may better capture the primary syndrome.\n\nApply these principles to the case. The patient has:\n- Avoidance/restriction of intake with markedly reduced dietary variety and context avoidance (school meals, social eating) driven by fear that eating causes severe pain/vomiting.\n- Absence of weight/shape concerns, no binge eating, no drive for thinness.\n- Measurable consequences of undernutrition: iron deficiency (ferritin $9 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$, microcytosis, mild anemia), and marked psychosocial interference.\n- Normal BMI $21.3 \\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$ and stable weight, which does not exclude ARFID when nutritional deficiency or psychosocial interference criteria are met.\n- Self-induced vomiting is used as a safety behavior to preempt pain rather than as a weight-control method.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), aversive-consequence subtype. The decisive features align with DSM-5-TR: the feeding disturbance is driven by fear of aversive consequences of eating (anticipated pain/vomiting), there is no overvaluation of weight/shape, and there are clinically significant consequences in the form of a significant nutritional deficiency (iron deficiency) and marked psychosocial interference. Normal BMI does not negate ARFID, as the criteria can be met via nutritional deficiency or psychosocial impairment even without weight loss. The pattern of self-induced vomiting as a safety behavior to avoid perceived gastrointestinal pain is compatible with the aversive-consequence maintaining mechanism within ARFID. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. Rumination disorder. Although there is postprandial expulsion of gastric contents, the phenomenology here is self-induced vomiting using digital stimulation to proactively “empty the stomach,” not effortless regurgitation with re-chewing or re-swallowing. Moreover, DSM-5-TR requires that rumination disorder not be better explained by another eating disorder; in this case, the broader syndrome of avoidance/restriction with nutritional deficiency and psychosocial impairment, driven by fear of aversive consequences, is more parsimoniously explained by ARFID. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. Functional gastrointestinal disorder (functional dyspepsia). The patient does meet elements of functional dyspepsia (epigastric pain and normal evaluations), yet the core clinical problem extends beyond symptom perception to a feeding/eating disturbance producing nutritional deficiency and psychosocial impairment, with avoidance maintained by fear of aversive consequences. When a primary feeding disorder explains the behavioral pattern and consequences, DSM-5-TR ARFID is the superior primary diagnosis; functional gastrointestinal pathology may be a comorbidity or antecedent trigger but does not subsume the full syndrome. The deciding features in this option omit the central absence of weight/shape concerns and the diagnostic threshold reached via nutritional deficiency and psychosocial interference. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Bulimia nervosa, purging type. Self-induced vomiting occurs, but there are no binge-eating episodes with loss of control and no overvaluation of weight/shape, both of which are required for bulimia nervosa. The motive for vomiting is to avert pain, not to influence weight/shape. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. Specific phobia (vomiting), primary. Fear of vomiting (emetophobia) can drive avoidance; however, DSM-5-TR indicates that when the disturbance is characterized by avoidant/restrictive eating with nutritional and psychosocial consequences, ARFID provides a more accurate primary diagnosis, with a fear of aversive consequences being the maintaining mechanism. The presence of nutritional deficiency and a structured feeding disturbance favors ARFID over a primary specific phobia diagnosis. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best-fitting diagnosis and deciding features are captured by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4692076"}, {"introduction": "Nutritional rehabilitation in ARFID often involves a transition from enteral or supplemental feeding back to exclusive oral intake.

The described intervention—a stepwise increase in oral intake coupled with a corresponding reduction in enteral support—is a standard therapeutic strategy for rehabilitating patients with eating disorders like ARFID.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data to arrive at a unique solution. The phrasing \"the oral intake fraction increases by $\\Delta f = 0.10$\" is interpreted as an additive increase to the fraction, which is the most standard interpretation of such a statement in a quantitative context. The schedule for these increases is explicitly defined. There are no internal contradictions or missing pieces of information. The problem is objective and free from non-scientific or subjective language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe core of the problem lies in the principle of energy balance. The total daily energy requirement, $E$, must be met by the sum of energy from oral intake, $E_{oral}$, and energy from enteral feeding, $E_{enteral}$.\n$$E = E_{oral} + E_{enteral}$$\n\nThe oral intake is described as a fraction, $f$, of the total daily energy requirement.\n$$E_{oral} = f \\cdot E$$\n\nBy substituting this into the energy balance equation, we can solve for the required enteral energy intake.\n$$E_{enteral} = E - E_{oral} = E - (f \\cdot E) = (1 - f) \\cdot E$$\n\nThe problem requires the volume of the enteral formula, $V_{enteral}$. The caloric density, $D$, is defined as the energy per unit volume.\n$$D = \\frac{E_{enteral}}{V_{enteral}}$$\n\nRearranging this definition to solve for the volume gives:\n$$V_{enteral} = \\frac{E_{enteral}}{D}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $E_{enteral}$ yields the final symbolic formula for the required enteral volume:\n$$V_{enteral} = \\frac{(1 - f) \\cdot E}{D}$$\n\nThe next step is to determine the correct value of the oral intake fraction, $f$, for day $21$. The plan starts with a baseline fraction of $f_{initial} = 0.50$. Increases of $\\Delta f = 0.10$ are implemented at the start of specified weeks.\n- The initial state (prior to day $0$) has an oral fraction of $0.50$.\n- For the week starting on day $0$ (days $0$-$6$), the first increase is applied: $f_0 = 0.50 + 0.10 = 0.60$.\n- For the week starting on day $7$ (days $7$-$13$), the second increase is applied: $f_1 = 0.60 + 0.10 = 0.70$.\n- For the week starting on day $14$ (days $14$-$20$), the third increase is applied: $f_2 = 0.70 + 0.10 = 0.80$.\n- For the week starting on day $21$ (days $21$-$27$), the fourth increase is applied: $f_3 = 0.80 + 0.10 = 0.90$.\n\nThe question asks for the enteral volume on day $21$. This day falls within the week governed by the fraction $f_3$. Therefore, the oral intake fraction to be used in the calculation is $f = 0.90$. This value is equal to the specified cap of $0.90$, so it is a valid fraction for the plan.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into the derived formula:\n- $E = 1800 \\,\\mathrm{kcal/day}$\n- $D = 1.5 \\,\\mathrm{kcal}/\\mathrm{mL}$\n- $f = 0.90$\n\n$$V_{enteral} = \\frac{(1 - 0.90) \\cdot 1800}{1.5}$$\n$$V_{enteral} = \\frac{0.10 \\cdot 1800}{1.5}$$\n$$V_{enteral} = \\frac{180}{1.5}$$\n$$V_{enteral} = 120 \\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value of $120$ has two or three significant figures depending on context.

However, in nutritional rehabilitation of an underweight child, the goal is to restore both fat mass and, crucially, fat-free mass (muscle, bone, and organ tissue). Fat-free mass has a much lower energy density (approximately $1800 \\, \\mathrm{kcal/kg}$) due to its high water content. Therefore, the actual energy cost per kilogram of healthy weight gain is typically lower than $7700 \\, \\mathrm{kcal}$, as the gained weight is a composite of different tissues. Using this heuristic overestimates the required energy surplus for tissue deposition.\n\n2.  **Metabolic Adaptation**: Malnutrition leads to a downregulation of basal metabolic rate (BMR) as an energy-conserving mechanism. During refeeding, as nutritional status improves, the BMR increases. This means a portion of the increased energy intake is expended to fuel this rise in metabolism, rather than being stored as new tissue. The fixed heuristic does not account for this dynamic metabolic cost, which can be substantial during active rehabilitation.\n\n3.  **Energy Cost of Growth**: The patient is a $12$-year-old male, an age typically associated with the onset of the pubertal growth spurt. An energy surplus is required not only for \"catch-up\" weight gain but also to fuel normal linear growth and development. The problem simplifies this by assuming constant height, but in a real-world clinical scenario, the energy demands of growth are an essential component of total energy requirements and are not captured by a simple weight-gain heuristic.\n\nIn summary, while the $7700 \\, \\mathrm{kcal/kg}$ heuristic provides a rudimentary estimate, a precise clinical nutrition plan would require a more sophisticated approach that accounts for the composition of gained weight, metabolic changes, and the energy demands of normal growth.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2840}\n$$", "id": "4692129"}]}
