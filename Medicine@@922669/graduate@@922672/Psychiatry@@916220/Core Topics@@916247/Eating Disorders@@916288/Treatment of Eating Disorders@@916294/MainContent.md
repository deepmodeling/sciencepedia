## Introduction
The treatment of eating disorders represents one of the most complex challenges in modern psychiatry, demanding a sophisticated integration of medical acumen, nutritional science, and psychotherapeutic skill. These illnesses carry high rates of morbidity and mortality, stemming from both the severe physiological consequences of malnutrition and purging, and the deeply entrenched psychological pathology that drives them. A common knowledge gap for clinicians is the lack of a unified, sequential framework that guides when and how to apply different interventions—from managing a cardiac emergency to dismantling cognitive distortions. Without such a framework, treatment can become fragmented and ineffective, failing to address the foundational issues that perpetuate the disorder.

This article provides a comprehensive, evidence-based guide to navigating the treatment of eating disorders. It is structured to build knowledge from foundational principles to complex applications. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, establishes the non-negotiable hierarchy of care, detailing the pathophysiology of malnutrition and refeeding, the neurobiological basis for treatment sequencing, and the theoretical models of first-line psychotherapies. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, demonstrates how to translate these principles into clinical practice, addressing complex comorbidities, special populations, and the interface with other medical disciplines. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** offers interactive problems to solidify decision-making skills in critical areas like risk assessment and treatment planning. By following this structure, readers will gain a robust understanding of how to safely and effectively guide patients toward lasting recovery.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### A Phased, Risk-Stratified Framework for Treatment

The treatment of eating disorders is guided by a set of foundational principles that prioritize safety, address the physiological consequences of malnutrition and disordered eating behaviors, and finally target the core psychopathology that maintains the illness. This approach is structured as a phased, risk-stratified model that is adaptable across different diagnoses—including anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge-eating disorder (BED), and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID)—while remaining tailored to the specific needs of each condition.

The cornerstone of this framework is the hierarchical sequencing of interventions. First and foremost, **medical stabilization** is the immediate priority for any patient presenting with acute physiological instability. Imminent threats to life, such as severe electrolyte disturbances or cardiovascular compromise, must be addressed before any other therapeutic work can begin. Second, once life-threatening instability is controlled, **nutritional rehabilitation** becomes the central focus. This phase aims to reverse the systemic effects of starvation, normalize eating patterns, and restore the physiological and cognitive capacity necessary for psychological engagement. Only after a patient is medically stable and adequately nourished can the third phase, **psychotherapy**, be effectively delivered. This sequence is not arbitrary; it is grounded in the well-established fact that severe malnutrition compromises organ function and the higher-order cognitive processes required to benefit from therapy. [@problem_id:4770179]

This phased approach is implemented within a **stepped-care model**, which dictates that patients should be treated in the least restrictive setting that is both safe and effective. Treatment intensity can be escalated—from outpatient to an intensive outpatient program (IOP), a partial hospitalization program (PHP), a residential facility, or an inpatient medical or psychiatric unit—based on the level of medical or psychiatric risk, or a failure to respond to a lower level of care.

While the overarching framework is unified, the specific goals of treatment are diagnosis-specific:
-   In **anorexia nervosa**, the primary and non-negotiable goal is the restoration of weight to a medically safe range to reverse the sequelae of starvation.
-   In **bulimia nervosa**, the primary goal is the cessation of the binge-purge cycle and the establishment of a regular, structured pattern of eating.
-   In **binge-eating disorder**, the principal aim is the elimination of binge-eating episodes. Weight management may be a secondary, long-term goal, but it must be approached with caution so as not to undermine the primary goal by triggering restrictive eating patterns.
-   In **avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID)**, the goal is to achieve nutritional adequacy and expand the variety of foods consumed, addressing the underlying drivers such as sensory sensitivity, fear of aversive consequences, or lack of interest in food, without an emphasis on weight or shape concerns. [@problem_id:4770179]

### The Primacy of Medical and Nutritional Stabilization

A core principle in eating disorder treatment is that nutritional and medical restoration is a prerequisite for, not a byproduct of, psychological recovery. The proposal to defer nutritional rehabilitation in favor of medication-only strategies is based on a misunderstanding of the profound and systemic effects of starvation.

#### The Neurobiology of Starvation: Why Pharmacotherapy Fails in the Malnourished State

Severe malnutrition, such as that seen in a patient with a body mass index (BMI) of $14$, is not merely a behavioral state but a profound physiological crisis. The body initiates a series of adaptive responses to conserve energy, which manifest as many of the hallmark signs and symptoms of anorexia nervosa. These include a global downregulation of metabolism, leading to [bradycardia](@entry_id:152925), hypotension, and hypothermia, as well as the shutdown of non-essential functions like reproduction, resulting in amenorrhea. These changes are driven by a cascade of endocrine adaptations, including low levels of triiodothyronine ($T_3$), hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and elevated cortisol. Crucially, these physiological adaptations can only be reversed by the restoration of a positive energy balance through nutritional intake. Medications, which act as signaling molecules, cannot supply the energy or material substrates needed to correct this systemic catabolic state. [@problem_id:4770190]

Furthermore, the malnourished brain is unable to effectively respond to many psychotropic medications. This is particularly true for **selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)**. The synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin is entirely dependent on the availability of its dietary precursor, the essential amino acid **tryptophan**. In a state of starvation, tryptophan intake is severely limited. Moreover, the catabolism of [muscle tissue](@entry_id:145481) releases other large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) that compete with tryptophan for transport across the blood-brain barrier. The net result is a marked reduction in central serotonin synthesis. An SSRI like fluoxetine works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin from the synapse, thereby increasing its availability. However, if there is very little serotonin being synthesized and released in the first place, blocking its reuptake has a negligible effect. This substrate deficiency explains why numerous clinical trials have failed to show a significant antidepressant effect for SSRIs in acutely underweight patients with anorexia nervosa. Expecting a response by increasing the dose is futile; one cannot amplify a signal that is fundamentally absent. [@problem_id:4770188] [@problem_id:4770190]

Beyond inefficacy, administering medications to a severely malnourished patient is fraught with risk. The altered body composition, reduced serum albumin (which binds drugs), and electrolyte disturbances can dramatically alter drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, increasing the risk of life-threatening side effects such as cardiac conduction abnormalities (e.g., QTc interval prolongation). [@problem_id:4770190] The brain itself undergoes structural changes, including a reversible loss of gray matter volume, which requires metabolic substrates and energy—not just pharmacological signals—for recovery. [@problem_id:4770190] Therefore, nutritional rehabilitation is the foundational and non-negotiable first step of treatment.

#### Managing Acute Complications of Malnutrition and Refeeding

**Refeeding Syndrome**

The initiation of nutritional rehabilitation in a severely starved individual carries the risk of **refeeding syndrome**, a potentially fatal condition caused by rapid shifts in fluid and electrolytes. Its pathophysiology stems from the abrupt transition from a catabolic (low-insulin) to an anabolic (high-insulin) state.

During starvation, total body stores of key intracellular ions—phosphate ($PO_4^{3-}$), potassium ($K^+$), and magnesium ($Mg^{2+}$)—are severely depleted, though serum levels may be deceptively normal. When carbohydrate refeeding begins, the resulting hyperglycemia triggers a surge of insulin. This insulin drives glucose into cells, and along with it, the ions needed for metabolism.
-   **Hypophosphatemia**: Glucose phosphorylation and the synthesis of [adenosine triphosphate](@entry_id:144221) (ATP) consume large amounts of inorganic phosphate, causing a rapid influx of phosphate into cells and a precipitous drop in serum levels. Severe hypophosphatemia cripples ATP production, leading to widespread cellular energy failure, with devastating effects on high-energy-demand organs like the heart (impaired contractility) and diaphragm (respiratory failure).
-   **Hypokalemia**: Insulin directly stimulates the activity of the $\text{Na}^+/\text{K}^+$-ATPase pump, driving potassium into cells and leading to a rapid fall in serum potassium.
-   **Hypomagnesemia**: Magnesium, a crucial cofactor for all ATP-dependent reactions, is also driven into cells to support renewed anabolic activity.

Concurrent hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia dangerously destabilize the [electrical potential](@entry_id:272157) of cardiac myocytes, prolonging ventricular [repolarization](@entry_id:150957) (visible as a prolonged QTc interval on an ECG) and dramatically increasing the risk of malignant arrhythmias such as Torsades de Pointes and sudden cardiac death. Cautious refeeding with proactive electrolyte monitoring and repletion is therefore essential. [@problem_id:4770202]

**Gastrointestinal Complications**

Starvation also directly impacts the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic malnutrition causes atrophy of the smooth muscle of the gastric wall, impairing its contractile force. This leads to **delayed gastric emptying**, or **gastroparesis**, which manifests clinically as distressing symptoms of early satiety, postprandial fullness, and bloating. This can create a significant barrier to refeeding. The management strategy must accommodate this compromised gastric function. This includes:
-   **Small, frequent meals**: This approach provides adequate total energy while limiting the per-meal volume and mechanical workload on the weakened stomach.
-   **Temporary use of liquid nutrition**: Liquids empty from the stomach more easily than solids because they do not require extensive mechanical grinding (trituration). Liquid supplements can therefore be a critical tool for meeting caloric goals when solid food is poorly tolerated.
-   **Lowering insoluble fiber**: Indigestible fiber requires robust antral contractions to be broken down. In a gastroparetic stomach, it is poorly processed and can be retained, worsening symptoms and even posing a risk of forming a bezoar (a solid mass of indigestible material). [@problem_id:4770176]

#### Managing Complications of Purging Behaviors

**Pseudo-Bartter Syndrome and Rebound Edema**

Patients with bulimia nervosa who engage in chronic purging (e.g., self-induced vomiting, diuretic misuse) can develop a condition known as **pseudo-Bartter syndrome**. These behaviors cause chronic volume and salt depletion, which leads to a sustained, powerful activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) as a compensatory mechanism. High levels of aldosterone promote maximal sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys, while also causing potassium and hydrogen ion losses, leading to the characteristic hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

When purging behaviors abruptly cease, the RAAS does not immediately downregulate. For several days, the pathologically high aldosterone levels persist. In the face of a now-normal oral intake of salt and water, this leads to massive and rapid renal sodium and water retention. The resulting expansion of plasma volume increases capillary hydrostatic pressure ($P_c$), forcing fluid into the interstitial space and causing significant **rebound edema**. This rapid weight gain is often distressing and can trigger a relapse to purging.

The mechanism-based management is not fluid or sodium restriction, which would only prolong the volume depletion signal and perpetuate the hyperaldosteronism. Instead, the most effective approach is to administer a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, such as **spironolactone** (typically at $25$–$100$ mg/day). This directly blocks the effect of [aldosterone](@entry_id:150580) at the kidney, promoting sodium and water excretion and resolving the edema. As a potassium-sparing diuretic, it also helps to correct the underlying hypokalemia. This is combined with a careful, moderate sodium intake, which helps to normalize the effective arterial blood volume and provides the necessary negative feedback to finally shut down the overactive RAAS. [@problem_id:4770172]

**Seizure Risk and Pharmacotherapy Contraindications**

The electrolyte and acid-base disturbances caused by purging create a state of neuronal hyperexcitability, significantly lowering the [seizure threshold](@entry_id:185380). This occurs through at least two primary mechanisms. First, the combination of volume depletion-induced ADH secretion and excessive water intake can lead to **hyponatremia**. The resulting low extracellular osmolality drives water into brain cells, causing [cerebral edema](@entry_id:171059) and increasing seizure risk. Second, the **[metabolic alkalosis](@entry_id:172904)** from vomiting reduces the level of physiologically active ionized calcium in the blood, as more calcium binds to albumin. Because ionized calcium stabilizes neuronal membranes, its reduction leads to hyperexcitability.

This pro-convulsant physiological state has profound implications for pharmacotherapy. For example, **bupropion**, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, is known to lower the [seizure threshold](@entry_id:185380) in a dose-dependent manner. Administering this drug to a patient with active bulimia nervosa, whose brain is already in a hyperexcitable state, creates an unacceptably high risk of inducing a seizure. For this reason, bupropion is strictly contraindicated in patients with bulimia nervosa. The safer, evidence-based alternative for treating the mood and eating symptoms of bulimia nervosa is an SSRI, specifically **fluoxetine** at a target dose of approximately $60$ mg daily. [@problem_id:4770210] [@problem_id:4770179]

### Evidence-Based Psychotherapeutic Mechanisms

Once a patient is medically stable and nutritional rehabilitation is underway, psychotherapy can begin to effectively target the psychological factors that maintain the eating disorder. Several evidence-based models exist, each with a clear theoretical mechanism.

#### Family-Based Treatment (FBT) for Adolescents

For adolescents with anorexia nervosa, **Family-Based Treatment (FBT)** is the first-line intervention. FBT is agnostic about the cause of the illness and instead empowers parents to become an essential part of the solution. The treatment unfolds across three distinct phases:

-   **Phase 1: Weight Restoration Under Parental Control.** In this initial phase, parents are put in full charge of their adolescent’s nutrition. They decide what, when, and how much the adolescent eats to ensure weight restoration. This temporary removal of the adolescent's autonomy over eating is justified by two key principles. First is **safety**: malnutrition has compromised the adolescent's decision-making capacity, and parents, as legal guardians, have a duty to intervene to prevent serious harm. The second is **externalization**: the therapist helps the family to view the illness as an external force that has taken control, separating the illness from the adolescent’s identity. This reduces blame and allows the family to unite against the "anorexia" rather than fighting with their child. [@problem_id:4770200]

-   **Phase 2: Gradual Return of Control.** As the adolescent gains weight, becomes medically stable, and demonstrates more normalized eating behaviors, control over eating is gradually and systematically returned to them.

-   **Phase 3: Addressing Adolescent Developmental Issues.** Once weight is restored and the adolescent is eating independently, the focus of therapy shifts to broader adolescent developmental tasks, such as identity, autonomy, and peer relationships, and establishing a plan for relapse prevention. [@problem_id:4770200]

#### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Enhanced (CBT-E)

For adults and many older adolescents, **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Enhanced (CBT-E)** is a leading evidence-based treatment. It is a highly structured therapy that also proceeds in phases, with a clear rationale derived from cognitive and behavioral principles. The core premise is that eating disorder behaviors are maintained by a specific psychopathology, primarily the overvaluation of shape and weight.

-   **Stage 1: Starting Well.** The initial stage focuses on engagement, psychoeducation, and implementing key behavioral strategies. The central intervention is establishing a pattern of **regular eating** ($3$ meals and $2$-$3$ snacks per day). This behavioral change serves a critical function: it mechanically [interrupts](@entry_id:750773) the binge-purge cycle by reducing the physiological and psychological pressures that build up from dietary restraint. It directly targets the behavioral contingencies that maintain the disorder.

-   **Stage 2: Taking Stock.** This is a brief transitional phase to review progress and refine the treatment plan.

-   **Stage 3: Addressing Maintaining Mechanisms.** With the stabilizing effects of regular eating in place, the therapy moves to its core cognitive component: directly addressing the **overvaluation of weight and shape**. Techniques include cognitive restructuring and behavioral experiments designed to challenge the patient's belief that their self-worth is defined by their appearance. Other maintaining factors like body checking, avoidance, and dietary rules are also targeted.

-   **Stage 4: Ending Well.** The final stage is dedicated to **relapse prevention**. The patient develops a personalized plan for maintaining progress and anticipating and managing high-risk situations and potential setbacks.

The logic of CBT-E is to move from behavior to cognition. By first stabilizing the behavior of eating, the patient is in a much better position—physiologically and psychologically—to engage in the challenging cognitive work required for lasting recovery. [@problem_id:4770214]

### Defining and Navigating the Path to Recovery

Recovery from an eating disorder is a complex process that extends beyond simple weight restoration or the cessation of behaviors. A comprehensive understanding of remission is crucial for guiding clinical decisions.

#### Operationalizing Remission: Partial vs. Full Recovery

Recovery is best conceptualized across three domains: physical, behavioral, and cognitive. Full remission requires normalization across all three.
-   **Physical Recovery**: This includes the restoration of body weight to a healthy, individualized target range (e.g., a BMI of $19.0$ or higher) and the resumption of normal physiological functions, such as spontaneous menses in females.
-   **Behavioral Recovery**: This is defined by the sustained cessation of all eating disorder behaviors, including restriction, binge eating, purging, and driven exercise, and the establishment of a regular and flexible pattern of eating.
-   **Cognitive Recovery**: This involves a significant reduction in eating disorder-related thoughts, such that preoccupations with food, weight, and shape no longer dominate mental life, and critically, the **cessation of the overvaluation of weight and shape** as a primary determinant of self-worth.

A patient may achieve progress in some domains but not others. For instance, consider a patient with a history of AN who has successfully restored her weight to a healthy BMI of $19.2$ and has been free of all behavioral symptoms for over three months. By physical and behavioral criteria, she has made enormous progress. However, if she continues to endorse significant preoccupation with her shape and weight, engages in daily body checking, and her self-evaluation remains primarily dependent on her appearance, her cognitive symptoms persist. According to DSM-5 criteria, because the core cognitive disturbance (Criterion C) is still met, she is in **partial remission**, not full remission. This distinction is critical: discharging her from treatment would be premature and would leave the central driver of the illness unaddressed, creating a high risk of relapse. The appropriate clinical action is to continue active psychotherapy focused specifically on the remaining cognitive symptoms. [@problem_id:4770207]

#### Ethical Complexities: Autonomy and Involuntary Treatment in Severe Anorexia Nervosa

In cases of severe and life-threatening anorexia nervosa, clinicians may face a profound ethical conflict between the principle of **respect for autonomy** (honoring a patient's refusal of treatment) and the duties of **beneficence** (to act in the patient's best interest) and **nonmaleficence** (to do no harm).

A patient with a BMI of $13.2$, severe [bradycardia](@entry_id:152925), and critical electrolyte abnormalities is at imminent risk of death ($p \approx 0.20$ without intervention). If this patient refuses life-saving treatment, the ethical analysis hinges on an assessment of her **decisional capacity**. Respect for autonomy is predicated on the ability to make a capacitous choice. Capacity requires four elements: understanding information, appreciating its personal relevance, reasoning with it, and expressing a choice. While a patient with severe AN may be able to understand and state the risks, the illness itself can profoundly impair **appreciation** (the ability to believe the risk applies to oneself) and **reasoning** (the ability to weigh options in a way that is not distorted by the core psychopathology). A statement like "I do not think I will die" in the face of overwhelming medical evidence demonstrates a lack of appreciation.

When decisional capacity is thus compromised, the ethical obligation to honor the patient's refusal is weakened, and the duty of beneficence becomes paramount. In such cases, involuntary, time-limited medical treatment (e.g., nasogastric feeding) can be ethically justified under the legal doctrine of *parens patriae* (the state's duty to protect those who cannot protect themselves). This justification requires that the intervention be proportional—the benefits must clearly outweigh the risks (e.g., risk of death without treatment is far greater than risk of complications with treatment). Furthermore, the intervention must represent the least restrictive *effective* means to preserve life and create the possibility for future recovery and the restoration of true autonomy.
