## Introduction
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by profound physical, psychological, and social impairment, and it carries one of the highest mortality rates among all mental illnesses. Its complexity presents a significant challenge to clinicians, requiring a deep and integrated understanding that spans from molecular genetics to medical ethics. This article bridges the gap between foundational science and applied clinical practice, providing a comprehensive guide for trainees and practitioners navigating the multifaceted landscape of AN. It synthesizes current evidence to illuminate not only what AN is, but why it develops and persists, and how it can be effectively managed.

Over the following chapters, you will embark on a structured journey through the core aspects of this disorder. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, will lay the groundwork by dissecting the diagnostic criteria and exploring the intricate pathophysiology of starvation, the neurobiology of maladaptive behaviors, and the genetic underpinnings of the illness. Following this, the chapter on **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** will translate this foundational knowledge into practice, covering nuanced clinical assessment, evidence-based psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatments, and the critical legal and ethical dilemmas that arise in patient care. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section will offer opportunities to apply this knowledge to concrete clinical scenarios, solidifying the key concepts essential for competent and compassionate care.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delves into the fundamental principles and mechanisms that define anorexia nervosa (AN), progressing from its diagnostic formulation to the complex interplay of physiological, cognitive, and genetic factors that underpin its presentation and persistence. We will explore the "what" of the diagnosis and the "why" of its underlying pathophysiology, providing a framework for understanding this multifaceted disorder.

### The Diagnostic Construct of Anorexia Nervosa

The diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), is not merely a description of low weight but a specific psychiatric construct built upon three core criteria. Each criterion must be met for a diagnosis to be made.

**Criterion A: Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight.**
This criterion establishes the central behavioral feature of the disorder. **Significantly low body weight** is defined contextually, as a weight that is less than minimally normal for an individual's age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health. While no single threshold exists, a Body Mass Index (BMI), calculated as $BMI = \frac{\text{mass (kg)}}{\text{height (m)}^2}$, below $18.5 \, \text{kg/m}^2$ is considered underweight in adults, and values below $17.0 \, \text{kg/m}^2$ are common in clinical presentations of AN. For instance, a 22-year-old ballet student who is $1.66$ m tall and weighs $45$ kg has a BMI of approximately $16.3 \, \text{kg/m}^2$. This, combined with a history of significant weight loss from a stable premorbid weight of $58$ kg and physiological signs of starvation like irregular menses, clearly meets the "significantly low" threshold [@problem_id:4687065].

**Criterion B: Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight.**
This criterion captures the motivational driver of the restriction. Critically, it is a disjunctive ("or") statement. A patient may not verbally endorse a "fear" of gaining weight. However, the presence of persistent behaviors aimed at preventing weight gain is sufficient to meet this criterion. The aforementioned ballet student might deny fear but engage in meticulous food rituals, excessive exercise despite injury, and avoidance of calorie-dense foods to "avoid feeling heavy." These behaviors, which actively interfere with weight restoration, satisfy Criterion B even in the absence of an explicitly stated fear [@problem_id:4687065]. This distinction is vital for accurate diagnosis, as patients often lack insight or are ambivalent about their motivations.

**Criterion C: Disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight.**
This criterion describes the core psychopathology of body image disturbance. It can manifest in several ways:
1.  **Perceptual Disturbance:** Experiencing one's body as overweight despite objective evidence of emaciation.
2.  **Cognitive-Affective Disturbance:** The **overvaluation of weight and shape**, where self-worth is disproportionately or exclusively tied to body weight and shape. The patient who judges her self-worth by her stomach's "flatness" exemplifies this component [@problem_id:4687065].
3.  **Lack of Insight:** A persistent failure to recognize the medical gravity of the low body weight, often accompanied by the belief that the weight loss is normal or even healthy.

The inclusion of Criterion C as a necessary component of the diagnosis is supported by a robust body of evidence suggesting it is a causal and maintaining factor, not just a correlate. Evidence from prospective longitudinal studies shows that the overvaluation of weight and shape often temporally precedes the onset of restrictive behaviors. Furthermore, experimental evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrates that therapeutic interventions targeting this overvaluation lead to subsequent reductions in dietary restraint, independent of weight change itself. This suggests a causal link where the cognitive disturbance maintains the restrictive behavior. Finally, this criterion provides crucial **discriminant validity**, effectively distinguishing anorexia nervosa from conditions like Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID), where severe restriction and low weight occur in the absence of body image concerns [@problem_id:4687062].

### Subtypes and Severity Specification

Once the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa is established, it is further specified by subtype and severity, which has important implications for treatment and prognosis.

**Subtypes**
The two subtypes are based on the predominant behavioral presentation **during the last 3 months**:
*   **Restricting Type:** During the last 3 months, the individual has not engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, [diuretics](@entry_id:155404), or enemas). Weight loss is accomplished primarily through dieting, fasting, and/or excessive exercise. It is important to note that **excessive exercise** is classified as a restrictive behavior, not a purging one, for subtyping purposes.
*   **Binge-Eating/Purging Type:** During the last 3 months, the individual has engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating **or** purging behavior. This "or" is crucial; the presence of purging alone, even in the absence of objectively large binge-eating episodes, is sufficient for this subtype. For example, a patient with a BMI of $16.2 \, \text{kg/m}^2$ who engages in severe daily caloric restriction but has also self-induced vomiting on two occasions within the past three months would be classified as the binge-eating/purging type [@problem_id:4687070]. The term "recurrent" in this context does not have a strict frequency threshold like it does for bulimia nervosa.

**Severity Specifiers**
For adults, the DSM-5-TR provides severity specifiers based on BMI, which serve as a general indicator of medical risk.
*   **Mild:** $BMI \ge 17.0 \, \text{kg/m}^2$
*   **Moderate:** $BMI \, 16.0–16.99 \, \text{kg/m}^2$
*   **Severe:** $BMI \, 15.0–15.99 \, \text{kg/m}^2$
*   **Extreme:** $BMI  15.0 \, \text{kg/m}^2$

These thresholds partially align with the World Health Organization (WHO) categories of thinness but provide greater granularity at the lower end. While WHO defines all BMIs below $16.0 \, \text{kg/m}^2$ as "severe thinness," the DSM-5-TR subdivides this range into "severe" and "extreme." This distinction is clinically meaningful, as medical instability and mortality risk increase sharply as BMI drops below these thresholds. The specifiers are primarily a tool for stratifying somatic risk, as psychological symptom severity and functional impairment do not always correlate linearly with BMI [@problem_id:4687043].

### The Pathophysiology of Starvation and Refeeding

The state of prolonged energy deficit in anorexia nervosa triggers a cascade of profound physiological adaptations designed to conserve energy. These adaptations affect nearly every organ system and are the source of the disorder's high medical morbidity and mortality.

#### Endocrine Adaptations to Energy Deficit

The neuroendocrine system orchestrates a systemic shutdown of energy-expensive processes, most notably reproduction and high metabolic rates.

The suppression of the reproductive axis, leading to **amenorrhea** and low libido, is a hallmark of AN. This is a state of functional **hypogonadotropic hypogonadism**. The primary mechanism involves the hormone **[leptin](@entry_id:177998)**, which is secreted by adipose tissue and signals energy sufficiency to the brain. In starvation, low body fat leads to very low leptin levels. This reduces stimulatory input to hypothalamic neurons that produce **kisspeptin**, the principal activator of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. The resulting attenuation of pulsatile GnRH secretion leads to low production of pituitary gonadotropins—luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Without adequate gonadotropin stimulation, the ovaries cease [follicular development](@entry_id:272075) and estradiol production, resulting in amenorrhea. This process is further reinforced by the chronic stress of starvation, which activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to elevated cortisol levels that also suppress the reproductive axis [@problem_id:4687092].

The thyroid axis also adapts to conserve energy, producing the clinical symptom of **cold intolerance**. This state is not true [hypothyroidism](@entry_id:175606) but rather a functional adaptation known as **non-thyroidal illness syndrome** (or euthyroid sick syndrome). In starvation, the peripheral conversion of the precursor thyroid hormone thyroxine ($T_4$) to the highly active triiodothyronine ($T_3$) is reduced. This is accomplished by downregulation of type 1 [deiodinase](@entry_id:201988) enzyme activity and upregulation of type 3 [deiodinase](@entry_id:201988), which shunts $T_4$ toward the production of inactive **reverse $T_3$**. The resulting laboratory profile is characteristic: low $T_3$, high reverse $T_3$, and normal or low-normal $T_4$ and TSH. The low level of active $T_3$ induces a hypometabolic state, decreasing [basal metabolic rate](@entry_id:154634) and [thermogenesis](@entry_id:167810), which manifests as cold intolerance, [bradycardia](@entry_id:152925), and dry skin [@problem_id:4687092].

#### Cardiovascular Complications

The cardiovascular system is severely affected by anorexia nervosa, with complications representing a leading cause of death. **Sinus bradycardia** (a heart rate below 60 beats per minute) and **hypotension** are common, resulting from a combination of factors including increased parasympathetic (vagal) tone, decreased sympathetic tone, and reduced cardiac muscle mass. These are, in essence, energy-conserving adaptations [@problem_id:4687058].

More ominously, AN confers a high risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. A key substrate for these arrhythmias is **QTc prolongation** on the [electrocardiogram](@entry_id:153078) (ECG). The QT interval represents the time for ventricular depolarization and [repolarization](@entry_id:150957). Its prolongation reflects a delay in [repolarization](@entry_id:150957), which can trigger an [arrhythmia](@entry_id:155421) known as **torsades de pointes**. The primary drivers of QTc prolongation in AN are electrolyte disturbances, particularly **hypokalemia** (low potassium) and **hypomagnesemia** (low magnesium), often resulting from starvation or purging behaviors. From an electrophysiological standpoint, low extracellular potassium paradoxically reduces the function of the rapid delayed [rectifier](@entry_id:265678) potassium current ($I_{Kr}$), a critical outward current responsible for phase 3 [repolarization](@entry_id:150957) of the [cardiac action potential](@entry_id:148407). Impaired repolarization lengthens the action potential duration, manifesting as a prolonged QTc. Hypomagnesemia exacerbates this risk by further destabilizing repolarization. In patients who purge, co-occurring [metabolic alkalosis](@entry_id:172904) can reduce ionized calcium, which also contributes to QT prolongation [@problem_id:4687058].

#### The Pathophysiology of Refeeding Syndrome

Nutritional rehabilitation, while essential, carries its own grave risk: **refeeding syndrome**. This potentially fatal condition arises from the rapid metabolic shifts that occur when nutrition is reintroduced after a period of prolonged starvation.

In the starved state, total body stores of key intracellular electrolytes—primarily **phosphate**, **potassium**, and **magnesium**—and [vitamins](@entry_id:166919) like **thiamine** (vitamin B1) are severely depleted, even if serum levels appear normal. The reintroduction of nutrition, especially [carbohydrates](@entry_id:146417), triggers a surge in **insulin** secretion. This insulin surge is the catalyst for the syndrome. Insulin drives glucose, phosphate, potassium, and magnesium from the bloodstream into cells to fuel glycolysis and the synthesis of ATP and glycogen. This causes a massive and rapid intracellular shift of these ions, leading to acute and profound **hypophosphatemia**, **hypokalemia**, and **hypomagnesemia**.

The clinical consequences are dire. Severe hypophosphatemia impairs ATP production, leading to cellular dysfunction in high-energy tissues like the heart (cardiac failure), diaphragm (respiratory failure), and brain (delirium, seizures). Severe hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia precipitate cardiac arrhythmias. Concurrently, the sudden switch to carbohydrate metabolism massively increases the demand for the cofactor thiamine. The underlying deficiency is unmasked, impairing the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme and shunting pyruvate to lactate, causing **lactic acidosis**. The constellation of cardiac, pulmonary, and neurological collapse seen in a patient who develops dyspnea, edema, confusion, and arrhythmias 48 hours into refeeding is the classic presentation of this iatrogenic emergency [@problem_id:4687076].

### Neurobiological and Genetic Underpinnings

Research has begun to elucidate the brain-based mechanisms and genetic predispositions that contribute to the onset and maintenance of anorexia nervosa.

#### Cognitive and Neural Circuits of Maladaptive Behavior

A core feature of AN is a profound **cognitive rigidity** and difficulty with **set-shifting**—the ability to flexibly adapt to changing rules or circumstances. This manifests clinically as rigid adherence to eating rituals and an inability to deviate from routines. In neurocognitive terms, this is conceptualized as an abnormally high **cognitive switching cost** within **fronto-striatal circuits** that mediate executive functions. Individuals with AN may perceive their environment as overly stable and predictable (low perceived volatility), causing them to discount negative feedback (e.g., health warnings) as noise rather than a signal to change their strategy. This cognitive style is evident on laboratory tasks like the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), where individuals with AN typically show a significantly higher number of **perseverative errors**—inappropriately persisting with a previously correct rule after it has been changed. This deficit is considered a trait-like vulnerability, as it often persists even after weight restoration [@problem_id:4687049].

Modern [computational psychiatry](@entry_id:187590) provides a powerful model for how these behaviors are maintained at the circuit level. This model integrates reward learning, interoception, and cognitive control. According to [reinforcement learning](@entry_id:141144) theory, learning is driven by **reward prediction errors (RPEs)**, often encoded by dopamine in the **ventral striatum** (a key reward circuit). For healthy individuals, a palatable food like [sucrose](@entry_id:163013) has a positive utility, and its unexpected receipt generates a positive RPE that reinforces approach behavior. For individuals with AN, however, the conditioned fear of weight gain may imbue caloric food with a *negative* utility. Consequently, the unexpected receipt of sucrose generates a *negative* RPE, signaling an aversive outcome and deactivating the ventral striatum. Simultaneously, this creates an aversive interoceptive [prediction error](@entry_id:753692) in the **anterior insula**, a region critical for sensing internal bodily states and emotion, leading to anxiety and distress. This cycle is perpetuated by [top-down control](@entry_id:150596) from the **dorsolateral prefrontal cortex**, which rigidly enforces the aversive prior belief ("food is a threat") and down-weights the sensory evidence, thereby stabilizing food avoidance and preventing new learning [@problem_id:4687100].

#### Genetic Architecture and the Metabo-Psychiatric Model

Anorexia nervosa is a heritable disorder. Twin studies, which compare concordance rates between monozygotic (identical) and dizygotic (fraternal) twins, consistently demonstrate substantial genetic influence. Using methods like Falconer's formula ($h^2 = 2(r_{MZ} - r_{DZ})$), the narrow-sense **[heritability](@entry_id:151095) ($h^2$)** of liability for AN is estimated to be between $50\%$ and $60\%$. These studies also indicate that the contribution of the shared family environment is negligible, with the remaining variance attributable to non-shared environmental factors [@problem_id:4687083].

Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have further illuminated the genetic architecture of AN. These studies confirm that AN is highly **polygenic**, meaning its genetic risk is conferred by thousands of common genetic variants, each with a very small individual effect. A landmark finding from these studies is that the genetic loci associated with AN are enriched for genes involved not only in psychiatric pathways but also in metabolic pathways, particularly those related to lipid and [glucose metabolism](@entry_id:177881).

This has led to the conceptualization of AN as a **"metabo-psychiatric" disorder**. Analysis of genetic correlations ($r_g$) reveals a striking pattern: the genetic factors predisposing to AN are negatively correlated with genetic factors predisposing to high BMI, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Conversely, they are positively correlated with genetic factors for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. At the same time, the genetic risk for AN shows strong positive correlations with risk for other psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. This complex genetic architecture suggests that individuals who develop AN may carry a dual liability: a psychiatric predisposition to traits like anxiety and perfectionism, coupled with a metabolic predisposition that facilitates maintaining a low body weight in the face of starvation [@problem_id:4687083].
