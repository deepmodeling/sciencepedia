This is defined as the probability of a positive test given the presence of the disease, $P(\\text{positive test} \\mid \\text{UTI})$.\n- Specificity of the urine dip test, $Sp = 0.90$.

The concepts of pretest probability, sensitivity, and specificity are well-defined statistical measures.

The objective is clearly stated. The problem is self-contained and admints a unique, stable solution.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is precise, quantitative, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\nLet $D$ denote the event that the child has a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). Let $D^c$ denote the complementary event that the child does not have a UTI. Let $T^+$ denote the event that the urine dip test result is positive. We are tasked with finding the posterior probability $P(D \\mid T^+)$.\n\nThe givens can be formally stated as:\n- The pretest or prior probability of disease: $P(D) = 0.10$.\n- The probability of a true positive (sensitivity): $Se = P(T^+ \\mid D) = 0.85$.\n- The probability of a true negative (specificity): $Sp = P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 0.90$, where $T^-$ is the event of a negative test result.\n\nFrom these, we can deduce:\n- The prior probability of not having the disease: $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n- The probability of a false positive, which is the complement of specificity: $P(T^+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\nAccording to the definition of conditional probability, the posterior probability $P(D \\mid T^+)$ is given by:\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T^+)$, is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. Using the definition of conditional probability, it can be expressed as:\n$$P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D)$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, which marginalizes over the disease status:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(T^+ \\mid D^c) P(D^c)$$\nThis equation sums the probabilities of the two mutually exclusive ways a positive test can occur: a true positive (patient has the disease and tests positive) and a false positive (patient does not have the disease but tests positive).\n\nCombining these components yields Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(T^+ \\mid D^c) P(D^c)}$$\n\nSubstituting the symbolic representations of sensitivity and specificity:\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{Se \\cdot P(D)}{Se \\cdot P(D) + (1 - Sp) \\cdot P(D^c)}$$\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{Se \\cdot P(D)}{Se \\cdot P(D) + (1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P(D))}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression:\n- $P(D) = 0.10$\n- $Se = 0.85$\n- $Sp = 0.90$, hence $1 - Sp = 0.10$\n- $P(D^c) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$\n\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{0.85 \\times 0.10}{(0.85 \\times 0.10) + (0.10 \\times 0.90)}$$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\n- Numerator: $0.85 \\times 0.10 = 0.085$. This is the probability of a true positive result in the population.\n- Denominator, first term: $0.85 \\times 0.10 = 0.085$.\n- Denominator, second term: $0.10 \\times 0.90 = 0.090$. This is the probability of a false positive result in the population.\n\nNow, substitute these back into the fraction:\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{0.085}{0.085 + 0.090}$$\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{0.085}{0.175}$$\n\nTo perform the division:\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{85}{175} = \\frac{17 \\times 5}{35 \\times 5} = \\frac{17}{35}$$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) \\approx 0.48571428...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $4$, $8$, $5$, and $7$. The fifth significant figure is $1$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the fourth digit).\n$$P(\\text{UTI} \\mid \\text{positive test}) \\approx 0.4857$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4857}$$", "id": "4709743"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis is established, selecting an effective treatment requires the critical appraisal of clinical trial literature.
