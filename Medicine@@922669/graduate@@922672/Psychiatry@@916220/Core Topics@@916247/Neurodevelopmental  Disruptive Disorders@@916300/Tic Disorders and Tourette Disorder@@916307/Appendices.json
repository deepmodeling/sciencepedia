In a representative cohort of youth referrals aged $6$–$17$, the composite indicator has been empirically observed to have sensitivity $0.88$ and specificity $0.96$ for the gold-standard diagnosis of Tourette's disorder.

This is the posterior probability, also known as the positive predictive value (PPV), denoted as $P(D | S^+)$.\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem, which is stated as:\n$$ P(D | S^+) = \\frac{P(S^+ | D) P(D)}{P(S^+)} $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(S^+)$, is the total probability of a positive screen. We can calculate this using the law of total probability, which involves considering both true positives and false positives:\n$$ P(S^+) = P(S^+ \\cap D) + P(S^+ \\cap D^c) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can expand this to:\n$$ P(S^+) = P(S^+ | D) P(D) + P(S^+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\n\nWe need to determine the values for all terms in this expansion.\nWe are given $P(D) = 0.03$. The probability of not having the disorder is the complement:\n$$ P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.03 = 0.97 $$\n\nWe are given the sensitivity, $P(S^+ | D) = 0.88$.\nWe are not directly given $P(S^+ | D^c)$, which is the false positive rate. However, we are given the specificity, $P(S^- | D^c) = 0.96$. For a patient who does not have the disorder, the screen can only be positive or negative. Therefore, the probability of a positive screen is the complement of the probability of a negative screen:\n$$ P(S^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(S^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.96 = 0.04 $$\n\nNow we can calculate the total probability of a positive screen, $P(S^+)$:\n$$ P(S^+) = (0.88)(0.03) + (0.04)(0.97) $$\n$$ P(S^+) = 0.0264 + 0.0388 $$\n$$ P(S^+) = 0.0652 $$\n\nNow we have all the components to substitute into Bayes' theorem:\nThe numerator is the probability of a true positive result: $P(S^+ | D) P(D) = (0.88)(0.03) = 0.0264$.\nThe denominator is the total probability of a positive result, which we just calculated as $P(S^+) = 0.0652$.\n\nThus, the posterior probability is:\n$$ P(D | S^+) = \\frac{0.0264}{0.0652} $$\n$$ P(D | S^+) \\approx 0.404907975... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P(D | S^+) \\approx 0.4049 $$\n\nThis is the updated probability that the patient who screened positive actually meets the DSM-5 criteria for Tourette's disorder.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.4049}\n$$", "id": "4768108"}, {"introduction": "Determining that a treatment has an effect is only the first step; quantifying the magnitude of that effect is crucial for clinical interpretation.

This effect size, often denoted as $d_z$ or $d_{av}$, is a standardized measure of the mean difference, specifically using the standard deviation of the difference scores as the standardizer. This approach correctly accounts for the correlated nature of the pre-test and post-test measurements inherent in a within-subject design, as specified by the problem's requirement for a method \"grounded in variance algebra for correlated measurements\".\n\nLet $X_{pre}$ and $X_{post}$ be the random variables representing the YGTSS scores at pre-treatment and post-treatment, respectively. The givens are:\n- Pre-treatment mean: $\\mu_{pre} = 32.4$\n- Pre-treatment standard deviation: $\\sigma_{pre} = 7.2$\n- Post-treatment mean: $\\mu_{post} = 24.9$\n- Post-treatment standard deviation: $\\sigma_{post} = 6.8$\n- Within-subject Pearson correlation: $r = 0.75$\n\nThe change score for an individual is defined as $D = X_{post} - X_{pre}$. The mean of these change scores is the difference between the post-treatment and pre-treatment means:\n$$ \\mu_D = \\mu_{post} - \\mu_{pre} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\mu_D = 24.9 - 32.4 = -7.5 $$\nThe sign is negative, indicating a reduction in tic severity, which represents a therapeutic improvement. The problem requires the sign to reflect the direction of change.\n\nThe standardizer for the within-subject Cohen's $d$ is the standard deviation of the difference scores, $\\sigma_D$. Using the principles of variance algebra for two correlated variables, the variance of the difference, $\\sigma_D^2$, is given by:\n$$ \\sigma_D^2 = \\text{Var}(X_{post} - X_{pre}) = \\text{Var}(X_{post}) + \\text{Var}(X_{pre}) - 2 \\cdot \\text{Cov}(X_{post}, X_{pre}) $$\nThe variance is the square of the standard deviation, so $\\text{Var}(X) = \\sigma^2$. The covariance, $\\text{Cov}(X_{post}, X_{pre})$, can be expressed in terms of the correlation coefficient $r$ and the standard deviations $\\sigma_{pre}$ and $\\sigma_{post}$:\n$$ \\text{Cov}(X_{post}, X_{pre}) = r \\cdot \\sigma_{pre} \\cdot \\sigma_{post} $$\nSubstituting these into the variance formula gives:\n$$ \\sigma_D^2 = \\sigma_{post}^2 + \\sigma_{pre}^2 - 2 \\cdot r \\cdot \\sigma_{pre} \\cdot \\sigma_{post} $$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values:\n$$ \\sigma_D^2 = (6.8)^2 + (7.2)^2 - 2 \\cdot (0.75) \\cdot (7.2) \\cdot (6.8) $$\n$$ \\sigma_D^2 = 46.24 + 51.84 - 1.5 \\cdot 48.96 $$\n$$ \\sigma_D^2 = 98.08 - 73.44 $$\n$$ \\sigma_D^2 = 24.64 $$\nThe standard deviation of the difference scores is the square root of this variance:\n$$ \\sigma_D = \\sqrt{24.64} $$\nThe within-subject Cohen’s $d$ is the ratio of the mean difference to the standard deviation of the differences:\n$$ d_z = \\frac{\\mu_D}{\\sigma_D} = \\frac{-7.5}{\\sqrt{24.64}} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ d_z \\approx \\frac{-7.5}{4.96386945...} \\approx -1.5109204... $$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures. Thus, the final numerical answer is $-1.511$.\n\nThe problem also requires an interpretation of this result. The computed effect size, $d = -1.511$, is exceptionally large by conventional standards. According to Cohen's benchmarks, an effect size magnitude of $0.2$ is considered small, $0.5$ is medium, and $0.8$ is large. An effect size of $|d| = 1.511$ far exceeds the threshold for a large effect, indicating a very substantial treatment impact relative to the variability of the change in the sample.\n\nIn the context of clinical research on Tourette's disorder, the clinical relevance of a change in the YGTSS score is often evaluated against specific benchmarks. A common benchmark for a clinically meaningful or significant response is a reduction of at least $25\\%$ from the baseline score. With a pre-treatment mean of $\\mu_{pre} = 32.4$, a $25\\%$ reduction corresponds to a change of $0.25 \\times 32.4 = 8.1$ points. The observed mean change is $\\mu_D = -7.5$ points, which is very close to this benchmark. Other literature may use a fixed threshold, such as a $7$-point reduction on the YGTSS Total Tic Score, as being clinically significant. The observed effect of $7.5$ points meets and slightly exceeds this benchmark. The large standardized effect size ($d = -1.511$) thus reflects that a clinically meaningful change in symptoms was observed, and that this change was highly consistent across participants. The high consistency is evidenced by the small standard deviation of the difference scores ($\\sigma_D \\approx 4.96$), which was significantly reduced (from what would be expected with uncorrelated scores) by the strong within-subject correlation of $r=0.75$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1.511}$$", "id": "4768064"}, {"introduction": "Effective clinical decision-making requires a clear-eyed comparison of a treatment's benefits against its potential harms.
