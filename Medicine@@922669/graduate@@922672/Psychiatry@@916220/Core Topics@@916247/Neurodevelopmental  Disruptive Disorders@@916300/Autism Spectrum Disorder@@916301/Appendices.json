Parent and teacher reports converge on prominent auditory hyperreactivity: the child covers ears, becomes distressed, and leaves group activities when exposed to everyday sounds (e.g., vacuum, cafeteria noise) multiple times daily. There is no compelling history of insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or circumscribed interests. Motor stereotypies (e.g., hand flapping) are observed rarely (less than once per week) and are not reported to interfere with functioning.

I will first validate the problem statement and then proceed to a complete solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Patient:** A child, age $6$ years.\n- **Presenting Problem:** Evaluation for possible Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).\n- **Core Symptom:** Prominent auditory hyperreactivity (covers ears, distressed, leaves group activities) occurring multiple times daily in response to everyday sounds.\n- **Absent/Sub-threshold Symptoms:**\n    - No compelling history of insistence on sameness.\n    - No compelling history of inflexible adherence to routines.\n    - No compelling history of circumscribed interests.\n    - Motor stereotypies (hand flapping) are rare (<$1$ time per week) and not functionally interfering.\n- **Other Information:** Social communication concerns are present but are not the focus of the question.\n- **Diagnostic Framework:** Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).\n- **Explicit Rule 1:** DSM-5 Criterion B for ASD requires at least $2$ restricted and repetitive behavior (RRB) domains.\n- **Explicit Rule 2:** Sensory hyper- or hyporeactivity is one of the RRB domains.\n- **Explicit Rule 3:** Norm-referenced questionnaires use standardized scores (comparison of a raw score to a population distribution).\n- **Task:**\n    1.  Determine if DSM-5 Criterion B for ASD is met.\n    2.  Select an evidence-based strategy to quantify the severity of the auditory hyperreactivity using standardized sensory profiles.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement will be evaluated against the required criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in the established diagnostic framework of the DSM-5 for ASD and standard principles of psychometric assessment. The terms used (Criterion B, sensory hyperreactivity, standardized scores, ADOS-2, SPM) are all standard and well-defined within psychiatry and clinical psychology. The scenario is clinically realistic.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear clinical vignette and sufficient information, including explicit diagnostic rules, to answer the two-part question. A unique, logical conclusion can be derived.\n- **Objective:** The language is clinical and descriptive, free from subjective bias. The vignette presents facts about the child's behavior as reported by parents and teachers.\n\nThe problem statement has no identifiable flaws. It does not violate scientific principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, is not unrealistic, and is well-structured. It presents a standard, albeit nuanced, clinical reasoning task.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of DSM-5 Criterion B**\n\nThe DSM-5 defines Criterion B for Autism Spectrum Disorder as \"Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities,\" requiring at least **two** of the following four sub-domains:\n1.  Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech.\n2.  Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of behavior.\n3.  Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus.\n4.  Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment.\n\nLet us evaluate the patient's presentation against these four sub-domains based *only* on the information provided in the vignette:\n- **B1 (Stereotypies):** The vignette states motor stereotypies are \"rarely (less than once per week) and are not reported to interfere with functioning.\" For a symptom to be counted toward a psychiatric diagnosis, it must generally be persistent and cause clinically significant distress or impairment. Symptoms that are rare and non-interfering are typically considered sub-threshold. Therefore, this sub-domain is **not met**.\n- **B2 (Sameness/Routines):** The vignette explicitly states there is \"no compelling history of insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines.\" Therefore, this sub-domain is **not met**.\n- **B3 (Restricted Interests):** The vignette explicitly states there is \"no compelling history of... circumscribed interests.\" Therefore, this sub-domain is **not met**.\n- **B4 (Sensory Reactivity):** The vignette describes \"prominent auditory hyperreactivity\" that is frequent (\"multiple times daily\") and causes significant distress and functional impairment (\"becomes distressed, and leaves group activities\"). This clearly meets the threshold for this sub-domain. Therefore, this sub-domain is **met**.\n\n**Conclusion on Criterion B:** The child's presentation clearly meets the criteria for one sub-domain (B4, sensory hyperreactivity). However, the DSM-5 explicitly requires that at least $2$ of the $4$ sub-domains be met. Based on the information provided, the child exhibits only $1$ of the $4$ necessary types of behavior. Thus, DSM-5 Criterion B is **not met**.\n\n**Part 2: Strategy for Quantifying Sensory Reactivity Severity**\n\nThe task is to choose an \"evidence-based strategy to quantify the sensory reactivity severity using standardized sensory profiles.\" The provided principles emphasize the use of norm-referenced questionnaires and standardized scores. An appropriate strategy must adhere to these psychometric principles.\n\n- **Use of Standardized Sensory Profiles:** This is the core requirement. Tools like the Sensory Profile 2 (SP-2) or the Sensory Processing Measure, Second Edition (SPM-2) are questionnaires completed by parents and teachers, designed specifically for this purpose.\n- **Norm-Referencing:** These instruments are norm-referenced. A child's raw score (e.g., the sum of ratings on auditory-related items) is compared to the distribution of scores from a large, age-matched standardization sample.\n- **Quantification with Standardized Scores:** This comparison yields a standardized score, such as a T-score (mean $M=50$, standard deviation $SD=10$), a z-score ($M=0, SD=1$), or a percentile rank. These scores provide an objective measure of severity, indicating how far the child's sensory reactivity deviates from that of typical peers. For instance, a T-score of $70$ would be $2$ standard deviations above the mean, indicating a clinically significant issue.\n- **Convergent Validity:** Using multiple informants (e.g., parent and teacher) and multiple instruments (e.g., SPM-2 and SP-2) allows a clinician to check for consistency of the findings across different settings and measures, strengthening the validity of the conclusion.\n\nAn optimal strategy would therefore involve administering a tool like the SPM-2 Home Form to a parent and the SPM-2 School Form to the teacher. The raw scores on the Auditory Processing scale would be converted to T-scores. These T-scores would provide a quantitative index of the severity of the auditory hyperreactivity at home and at school, relative to peers.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Criterion B is met because severe sensory hyperreactivity alone satisfies the requirement; quantify severity using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2) total score and a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) severity rating without reference to sensory-specific norms.**\nThis option contains two errors.\n1.  It incorrectly states that Criterion B is met. As per the problem's own rules, one sub-domain is insufficient; DSM-5 requires at least $2$.\n2.  It proposes an incorrect quantification method. The ADOS-2 is a diagnostic observation, and its total score reflects overall ASD symptom severity, not the specific severity of auditory hyperreactivity. The CGI is a subjective clinician rating, not a standardized, norm-referenced measure.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Criterion B is not met on the information provided because only one restricted and repetitive behavior domain (sensory hyperreactivity) is clearly present; quantify severity using a norm-referenced sensory profile by converting raw auditory scores to standardized metrics, for example, the Sensory Processing Measure (SPM or SPM-2) Home and School T-scores (mean $50$, standard deviation $10$) via $z$-score transformation, and corroborate with the Sensory Profile 2 auditory processing percentile ranks for convergent validity across settings.**\nThis option is correct on both points.\n1.  It correctly concludes that Criterion B is not met based on the information provided, as only one sub-domain is present.\n2.  It describes the exact, psychometrically sound procedure for quantifying sensory severity: using norm-referenced questionnaires (SPM, Sensory Profile 2), converting raw scores to standardized scores (T-scores, percentiles), and using multiple informants/settings for corroboration. The details on T-scores ($M=50, SD=10$) are correct.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**C. Criterion B is indeterminate until nonverbal intelligence is assessed; quantify severity by relying on ADOS-2 calibrated severity scores because they are sufficient to capture sensory hyperreactivity.**\nThis option contains two errors.\n1.  It incorrectly claims that Criterion B status is indeterminate pending IQ testing. The determination of whether the behavioral criteria are met is based on observation and history, independent of cognitive ability.\n2.  It proposes an incorrect quantification method. ADOS-2 calibrated severity scores (CSS) are global measures of social affect and RRB severity, not specific measures for quantifying an isolated sensory symptom.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Criterion B is met because minimal stereotypies count when combined with one sensory symptom; quantify severity using therapist-estimated frequency counts (e.g., number of ear-covering episodes per day) without standardized comparison to age norms.**\nThis option contains two errors.\n1.  It makes a poor clinical judgment that \"minimal\" (rare, non-impairing) stereotypies are sufficient to meet a diagnostic criterion, leading to the incorrect conclusion that Criterion B is met.\n2.  It proposes a non-standardized quantification method. Simple frequency counts without comparison to norms do not provide a standardized measure of severity as required by evidence-based practice and the prompt's principles.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Criterion B requires at least three sensory modalities to be affected; quantify severity with the Sensory Integration and Praxis Tests (SIPT) as the sole instrument because it directly measures sensory processing anomalies relevant to Criterion B.**\nThis option contains two errors.\n1.  It invents a non-existent diagnostic rule. The DSM-5's sensory sub-domain (B4) can be met by a significant abnormality in a single sensory modality. There is no requirement for three affected modalities.\n2.  It proposes an inappropriate assessment strategy. The SIPT is a performance-based test, not a caregiver report measure, and is not the standard tool for quantifying the functional impairments described. Furthermore, reliance on a \"sole instrument\" is contrary to best practice, which favors a multi-method approach.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4690909"}, {"introduction": "Beyond diagnosis, a deep understanding of ASD involves appreciating its strong genetic underpinnings.

Assume a standard liability-threshold model for ASD with unit total variance and the classical twin design assumptions: the equal environments assumption, random mating with respect to liability, and that the MZ and DZ twin correlations approximate correlations of liability.

One can also derive the shared environmental component in the $ACE$ model using $C = r_{MZ} - A = r_{MZ} - 2(r_{MZ} - r_{DZ}) = 2r_{DZ} - r_{MZ}$. With the present values, $C = 2(0.31) - 0.77 = -0.15$, which is not admissible as a variance component. This pattern ($r_{MZ} > 2r_{DZ}$) is a diagnostic sign that the $ACE$ model is misspecified for these data and that a model allowing dominance genetic effects ($ADE$) may be more appropriate. Under an $ADE$ model, the broad-sense heritability equals $r_{MZ}$, which would be $0.77$, and shared environment would be negligible. Regardless of model choice, the non-shared environment ($E$) remains necessary to account for the residual variance and the observation that $r_{MZ} < 1$, indicating that environmental and idiosyncratic factors still contribute meaningfully to individual liability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.920}$$", "id": "4690919"}, {"introduction": "Current research aims to move from description to explanation, building computational models of the cognitive processes that may underlie ASD symptoms. This advanced exercise introduces you to the predictive processing framework, a leading theory in computational psychiatry, through a hypothetical modeling scenario. You will implement a simple Bayesian model to simulate how differences in sensory precision—a hypothesized feature of ASD—can lead to behaviors like insistence on sameness, providing a tangible link between a neurobiological theory and a clinical manifestation [@problem_id:4690957].", "problem": "You are tasked with building a minimal yet principled simulation of Bayesian perceptual inference that captures a core proposal in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): that increased sensory precision alters posterior beliefs and can drive insistence on sameness behaviors. Ground the model in first principles and well-tested facts, without invoking shortcuts. Use the following constraints.\n\nScientific context and foundational base: In predictive processing accounts of ASD, increased sensory precision is hypothesized to amplify the influence of sensory evidence relative to prior beliefs. You will formalize this by starting from Bayes theorem and a simple Gaussian generative model for a one-dimensional perception task. Two competing hypotheses are considered: the environment stimulus at a given moment is the same as a learned template, denoted as $H_s$ (\"same\"), or different, denoted as $H_d$ (\"different\"). The observation is a real-valued discrepancy $y$ between the current stimulus and the template, measured along a single perceptual dimension. The generative model must assume Gaussian likelihoods with known means and variance, and a Bernoulli prior over hypotheses with parameter $\\pi$ for $H_s$. To operationalize sensory precision, scale the influence of the likelihood function by a precision parameter $\\lambda$ through an exponentiation of the likelihood term before applying Bayes theorem. This weighting reflects a widely accepted approach to precision-weighted inference in Bayesian cognitive models.\n\nCore definitions and assumptions to use:\n- Use Bayes theorem and standard Gaussian probability density functions. Do not introduce any non-Gaussian forms.\n- The hypotheses have Gaussian likelihoods with the same variance $\\sigma^2$ but different means: $H_s$ has mean $\\mu_s$, and $H_d$ has mean $\\mu_d$.\n- The prior probability of $H_s$ is $\\pi$, hence the prior probability of $H_d$ is $1 - \\pi$.\n- Sensory precision is captured by scaling the likelihoods via exponentiation by $\\lambda$ before applying Bayes theorem, thereby increasing the relative impact of sensory evidence on the posterior when $\\lambda$ is larger.\n\nBehavioral prediction rule: Define \"insistence on sameness\" behavior as a thresholded decision on the posterior of $H_s$. If the posterior probability of $H_s$ falls strictly below a threshold $\\theta$, predict a behavior indicating insistence on sameness (boolean output $True$); otherwise predict no insistence behavior (boolean output $False$). This rule models corrective behavior when belief in sameness becomes too low.\n\nYour task:\n- Implement a program that, for each test case in the suite below, computes the posterior probability of $H_s$ using the precision-weighted Bayesian update described above and then applies the threshold rule to predict the boolean behavior.\n- There are no physical units involved in this task.\n- Angles are not involved in this task.\n- Percentages must not be used; all probabilities must be represented as decimals in $[0,1]$.\n\nGaussian components to use:\n- The Gaussian probability density function for a real observation $y$ with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$ is defined by\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}(y; \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\sigma} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(y - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right).\n$$\n\nPrecision-weighted update requirement:\n- Apply the precision-weighting by raising each hypothesis likelihood to the power $\\lambda$ before combining with the prior via Bayes theorem.

This posterior probability, $P(H_s|y)$, is then compared to a threshold $\\theta$ to determine a behavioral prediction.\n\nThe Bayesian model involves two mutually exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses: $H_s$ (stimulus is the same as a template) and $H_d$ (stimulus is different).\n\nThe prior probabilities are given as:\n$$ P(H_s) = \\pi $$\n$$ P(H_d) = 1 - \\pi $$\n\nThe likelihood of observing a discrepancy $y$ under each hypothesis is given by a Gaussian probability density function, $\\mathcal{N}(y; \\mu, \\sigma^2)$:\n$$ P(y|H_s) = \\mathcal{N}(y; \\mu_s, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\sigma} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(y - \\mu_s)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) $$\n$$ P(y|H_d) = \\mathcal{N}(y; \\mu_d, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\sigma} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(y - \\mu_d)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) $$\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of $H_s$ is:\n$$ P(H_s|y) = \\frac{P(y|H_s) P(H_s)}{P(y)} = \\frac{P(y|H_s) P(H_s)}{P(y|H_s) P(H_s) + P(y|H_d) P(H_d)} $$\n\nThe problem introduces a key modification to standard Bayesian inference: the influence of the likelihood is scaled by a sensory precision parameter $\\lambda$. This is implemented by raising the likelihood function to the power of $\\lambda$ before it is combined with the prior. Let us denote the precision-weighted posterior as $P(H_s|y, \\lambda)$. The formula becomes:\n$$ P(H_s|y, \\lambda) = \\frac{[P(y|H_s)]^\\lambda P(H_s)}{[P(y|H_s)]^\\lambda P(H_s) + [P(y|H_d)]^\\lambda P(H_d)} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the Gaussian forms for the likelihoods:\n$$ [P(y|H_s)]^\\lambda = \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\sigma} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(y - \\mu_s)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right]^\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\sigma}\\right)^{\\!\\lambda} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda(y - \\mu_s)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) $$\n$$ [P(y|H_d)]^\\lambda = \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\sigma} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(y - \\mu_d)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right]^\\lambda = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\sigma}\\right)^{\\!\\lambda} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda(y - \\mu_d)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) $$\nThe normalization constant of the Gaussian, $(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\sigma})^\\lambda$, is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator of the posterior probability expression. Thus, it cancels out, simplifying the calculation:\n$$ P(H_s|y, \\lambda) = \\frac{\\pi \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda(y - \\mu_s)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)}{\\pi \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda(y - \\mu_s)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) + (1-\\pi) \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda(y - \\mu_d)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)} $$\nThis form is correct but can be numerically unstable due to the properties of the exponential function. A more robust formulation can be derived by working with log-odds. The posterior odds of $H_s$ versus $H_d$ are given by the product of the likelihood ratio (raised to the power $\\lambda$) and the prior odds:\n$$ \\frac{P(H_s|y, \\lambda)}{P(H_d|y, \\lambda)} = \\left(\\frac{P(y|H_s)}{P(y|H_d)}\\right)^{\\!\\lambda} \\frac{P(H_s)}{P(H_d)} $$\nIt is often more convenient to work with the log-posterior-odds of $H_d$ versus $H_s$:\n$$ \\log\\left(\\frac{P(H_d|y, \\lambda)}{P(H_s|y, \\lambda)}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\frac{P(H_d)}{P(H_s)}\\right) + \\lambda \\log\\left(\\frac{P(y|H_d)}{P(y|H_s)}\\right) $$\nLet's call this term $A$. $A$ is the log posterior odds in favor of $H_d$.\nThe first term is the log prior odds: $\\log(\\frac{1-\\pi}{\\pi})$.\nThe second term is the precision-weighted log-likelihood ratio. The ratio of the likelihoods simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{P(y|H_d)}{P(y|H_s)} = \\frac{\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(y - \\mu_d)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)}{\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(y - \\mu_s)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{(y - \\mu_s)^2 - (y - \\mu_d)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) $$\nTaking the logarithm gives the log-likelihood ratio:\n$$ \\log\\left(\\frac{P(y|H_d)}{P(y|H_s)}\\right) = \\frac{(y - \\mu_s)^2 - (y - \\mu_d)^2}{2\\sigma^2} = \\frac{(y^2 - 2y\\mu_s + \\mu_s^2) - (y^2 - 2y\\mu_d + \\mu_d^2)}{2\\sigma^2} = \\frac{2y(\\mu_d - \\mu_s) + \\mu_s^2 - \\mu_d^2}{2\\sigma^2} $$\nTherefore, the full expression for $A$ is:\n$$ A = \\log\\left(\\frac{1-\\pi}{\\pi}\\right) + \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\sigma^2} \\left[ 2y(\\mu_d - \\mu_s) + \\mu_s^2 - \\mu_d^2 \\right] $$\nThe posterior probability $P(H_s|y, \\lambda)$ can be recovered from the log-odds $A$ using the logistic (sigmoid) function. Since $A = \\log(P(H_d|y, \\lambda)/P(H_s|y, \\lambda))$, we have $\\exp(A) = P(H_d|y, \\lambda)/P(H_s|y, \\lambda)$. Using the fact that $P(H_s|y, \\lambda) + P(H_d|y, \\lambda) = 1$, we can solve for $P(H_s|y, \\lambda)$:\n$$ P(H_s|y, \\lambda) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(A)} $$\nThis is a numerically stable expression for the desired posterior probability.\n\nThe final step is to apply the behavioral prediction rule: \"insistence on sameness\" behavior occurs if the posterior probability of $H_s$ is strictly less than the threshold $\\theta$. Thus, for each test case, we compute $P(H_s|y, \\lambda)$ and determine the boolean output as:\n$$ \\text{Behavior} = (P(H_s|y, \\lambda) < \\theta) $$\n\nAn important edge case is when $\\lambda=0$. In this scenario, the data has no influence on the posterior belief. The term multiplied by $\\lambda$ becomes zero, so $A = \\log(\\frac{1-\\pi}{\\pi})$. The posterior probability becomes $P(H_s|y, \\lambda=0) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(\\log(\\frac{1-\\pi}{\\pi}))} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1-\\pi}{\\pi}} = \\pi$. The posterior correctly reduces to the prior, as expected. Our derived formula naturally handles this case.\n\nThe algorithm for each test case $(\\pi, \\mu_s, \\mu_d, \\sigma, y, \\lambda, \\theta)$ is as follows:\n1. Calculate the log posterior odds $A$ using the formula derived above.\n2. Calculate the posterior probability $P_s = P(H_s|y, \\lambda) = 1 / (1 + \\exp(A))$.\n3. Compare $P_s$ with the threshold $\\theta$ to get the boolean decision: $P_s < \\theta$.\nThis procedure will be implemented for all provided test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the boolean behavior prediction for a series of test cases\n    based on a precision-weighted Bayesian inference model.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Test cases are provided as tuples of (pi, mu_s, mu_d, sigma, y, lambda, theta)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: Standard precision, evidence supports H_s\n        (0.7, 0.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.2, 1.0, 0.5),\n        # Case 2: High precision, ambiguous evidence drives posterior below threshold\n        (0.7, 0.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.2, 3.0, 0.5),\n        # Case 3: Zero precision, posterior equals prior\n        (0.7, 0.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.2, 0.0, 0.5),\n        # Case 4: Evidence strongly against H_s\n        (0.7, 0.0, 2.0, 1.0, 4.0, 1.0, 0.5),\n        # Case 5: High precision and strong evidence for H_s overcomes opposing prior\n        (0.4, 0.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.1, 5.0, 0.5),\n        # Case 6: Strong prior, ambiguous evidence, high threshold\n        (0.95, 0.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.2, 1.0, 0.9),\n        # Case 7: Same as Case 6, but high precision amplifies evidence, pushing posterior below threshold\n        (0.95, 0.0, 2.0, 1.0, 1.2, 3.0, 0.9),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        pi, mu_s, mu_d, sigma, y, lam, theta = case\n        \n        # Calculate the log posterior odds of H_d vs H_s, denoted as A.\n        # A = log( (1-pi)/pi ) + lambda * log( P(y|H_d) / P(y|H_s) )\n        \n        # Log prior odds term for H_d vs H_s\n        # Note: The problem givens ensure 0 < pi < 1, so np.log is safe.\n        log_prior_odds = np.log((1 - pi) / pi)\n\n        # Precision-weighted log likelihood ratio term for H_d vs H_s\n        # log_llr = (lambda / (2*sigma^2)) * [ 2*y*(mu_d - mu_s) + mu_s^2 - mu_d^2 ]\n        log_likelihood_ratio_term = (lam / (2 * sigma**2)) * \\\n                                    (2 * y * (mu_d - mu_s) + mu_s**2 - mu_d**2)\n\n        # Total log posterior odds A\n        A = log_prior_odds + log_likelihood_ratio_term\n\n        # Calculate the posterior probability of H_s using the logistic function\n        # P(H_s | y, lambda) = 1 / (1 + exp(A))\n        posterior_s = 1 / (1 + np.exp(A))\n        \n        # Apply the decision rule: predict insistence on sameness if P(H_s|y) < theta\n        decision = posterior_s < theta\n        results.append(decision)\n\n    # Format the final output as a comma-separated list of booleans in square brackets.\n    # The map(str, ...) converts Python booleans (True, False) to their string representations.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "id": "4690957"}]}
