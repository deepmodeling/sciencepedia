This approach is a cornerstone of evidence-based diagnosis.", "problem": "A child psychiatry intake clinic evaluates a referred child with recurrent school refusal. You must model diagnostic inference between Separation Anxiety Disorder (SAD) and Illness Anxiety Disorder (IAD) using first principles of probabilistic reasoning. Define the posterior odds as the ratio $O_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{P(\\text{SAD} \\mid E)}{P(\\text{IAD} \\mid E)}$, where $E$ denotes the totality of observed clinical evidence.\n\nVignette: A $\\;9\\;$-year-old presents with $\\;2\\;$ months of school refusal. He reports stomachaches predominantly on school mornings that abate on weekends and holidays, and he calls the school nurse to request to go home. He panics when his mother leaves the house, insists on sleeping in his parents’ bed, and during drop-off his distress lessens if his mother remains in the school lobby. Teachers report that at school he speaks only in whispers or is mute, whereas at home he speaks normally. Parents also report he has recently become convinced that bruises indicate leukemia, frequently searches online for serious diseases, and requires repeated medical reassurance despite normal examinations.\n\nAssume the following are the only two competing, mutually exclusive hypotheses in the diagnostic set for this calculation. In a comparable referred population, the pretest probabilities are $P(\\text{SAD}) = 0.40$ and $P(\\text{IAD}) = 0.15$. Treat the following five observed features as conditionally independent given diagnosis, and use the provided Bayes factors (likelihood ratios) in favor of SAD relative to IAD for each feature:\n\n- School-day morning somatic complaints that abate on weekends: Bayes factor $= 3.2$.\n- Marked nighttime refusal to sleep without a caregiver and panic with caregiver departures: Bayes factor $= 5.0$.\n- Symptom relief when the attachment figure remains in the school lobby at drop-off: Bayes factor $= 2.1$.\n- Context-bound mutism (speaks normally at home, markedly reduced speech at school for at least $\\;1\\;$ month): Bayes factor $= 1.9$.\n- Persistent conviction of having a serious illness with frequent health-related searches despite medical reassurance: Bayes factor $= 0.35$.\n\nUsing only well-established probabilistic principles that connect prior information, likelihoods, and posterior belief, compute the posterior odds $O_{\\text{post}}$ for SAD versus IAD implied by the vignette.

This is an application of Bayesian inference, specifically using Bayes' theorem in its odds form.\n\nLet $H_1$ represent the hypothesis that the child has SAD, and $H_2$ represent the hypothesis that the child has IAD. The problem asks for the posterior odds, $O_{\\text{post}}$, defined as the ratio of the posterior probabilities of these two hypotheses given the total evidence $E$:\n$$O_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{P(H_1 \\mid E)}{P(H_2 \\mid E)}$$\n\nBayes' theorem in odds form states that the posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the Bayes factor (or likelihood ratio):\n$$O_{\\text{post}} = O_{\\text{prior}} \\times BF(E)$$\nwhere the prior odds, $O_{\\text{prior}}$, represent the relative belief in the hypotheses before observing the evidence, and the Bayes factor, $BF(E)$, quantifies the strength of the evidence in favor of $H_1$ over $H_2$.\n\nThe prior odds are calculated from the given pretest probabilities:\n$$O_{\\text{prior}} = \\frac{P(H_1)}{P(H_2)} = \\frac{P(\\text{SAD})}{P(\\text{IAD})}$$\nThe Bayes factor for the total evidence $E$ is the ratio of the likelihoods of observing that evidence under each hypothesis:\n$$BF(E) = \\frac{P(E \\mid H_1)}{P(E \\mid H_2)} = \\frac{P(E \\mid \\text{SAD})}{P(E \\mid \\text{IAD})}$$\n\nThe total evidence $E$ consists of five distinct clinical features, which we can denote as $E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4,$ and $E_5$. The problem explicitly states that these features are to be treated as conditionally independent given the diagnosis. This assumption is critical, as it implies that the likelihood of observing the combined evidence is the product of the likelihoods of observing each individual feature:\n$$P(E \\mid H) = P(E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap \\dots \\cap E_5 \\mid H) = \\prod_{i=1}^{5} P(E_i \\mid H)$$\nConsequently, the overall Bayes factor for the total evidence $E$ is the product of the individual Bayes factors for each feature.

The schedule must align with therapeutic milestones and use appropriate informants.\n\n- **Baseline Assessment ($t_0$ or Week $0$):** Prior to the start of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), a comprehensive baseline is essential.\n  - **SCARED (Child- and Parent-report versions):** Administered to establish the initial severity of separation anxiety symptoms from both perspectives.\n  - **SMQ (Parent-report version):** Administered to establish the baseline severity and situational determinants of the child's selective mutism. For a $7$-year-old, the parent-report is the standard informant.\n\n- **In-Treatment Monitoring (Weeks $1$ through $12$):** The frequency of monitoring should be tailored to the specific measure and the expected pace of change.\n  - **SMQ (Parent-report):** The problem specifies higher-frequency early monitoring to capture rapid behavioral change, which is characteristic of behavioral interventions for selective mutism. A suitable schedule would be at **Week $2$**, **Week $4$**, and **Week $8$**. This front-loaded schedule allows the clinician to assess the initial response to behavioral techniques (e.g., stimulus fading, shaping) and to make timely adjustments.\n  - **SCARED (Child- and Parent-report):** Anxiety, particularly the cognitive components addressed in CBT, often changes more gradually than specific mute behaviors. To align with therapy milestones and minimize respondent fatigue, administrations at **Week $4$** (coinciding with the end of the initial psychoeducation/skill-building phase) and **Week $8$** (midway through the exposure/practice phase) are appropriate. This provides two interim data points to track progress without over-burdening the family.\n\n- **Post-Treatment Assessment ($t_{final}$ or Week $12$):** At the conclusion of the $12$-week therapy course, a final assessment is conducted to quantify the overall treatment effect.\n  - **SCARED (Child- and Parent-report):** Administered to provide the final post-treatment score for comparison against baseline.\n  - **SMQ (Parent-report):** Administered to provide the final post-treatment score.\n\n**Summary of Proposed Schedule:**\n- **Week $0$ (Baseline):** SCARED (Child & Parent), SMQ (Parent)\n- **Week $2$:** SMQ (Parent)\n- **Week $4$:** SCARED (Child & Parent), SMQ (Parent)\n- **Week $8$:** SCARED (Child & Parent), SMQ (Parent)\n- **Week $12$ (Post-Treatment):** SCARED (Child & Parent), SMQ (Parent)\n\n**Part 2: Derivation and Calculation of the Reliable Change Index (RCI)**\n\nThe Reliable Change Index (RCI) is a statistic used to determine if the magnitude of change in a score from one point in time to another is statistically significant, i.e., unlikely to be due to random measurement error. The derivation is rooted in Classical Test Theory (CTT).\n\n**Derivation from First Principles:**\n\n1.  According to CTT, an observed score, $X$, is the sum of a true score, $T$, and a random, independent error component, $E$.\n    $$ X = T + E $$\n2.  The RCI evaluates the change between two observed scores, a pre-treatment score $X_1$ and a post-treatment score $X_2$. The observed change is the difference score, $D = X_2 - X_1$.\n3.  The RCI is defined as the observed difference score divided by the standard error of this difference ($SE_{diff}$). The standard error of the difference quantifies the expected variability in the difference score due solely to measurement error.\n    $$ RCI = \\frac{X_2 - X_1}{SE_{diff}} $$\n4.  To derive $SE_{diff}$, we must first find its variance, $\\sigma_{diff_E}^2$. The error in the difference score is $E_2 - E_1$. Assuming the errors at the two measurement occasions are uncorrelated, the variance of their difference is the sum of their individual variances:\n    $$ \\sigma_{diff_E}^2 = \\text{Var}(E_2 - E_1) = \\text{Var}(E_2) + \\text{Var}(E_1) = \\sigma_{E_2}^2 + \\sigma_{E_1}^2 $$\n5.  Each error variance, $\\sigma_E^2$, is related to the reliability of the test, $r$, and the variance of the observed scores in the population, $\\sigma_X^2$. Reliability is the proportion of observed score variance that is attributable to true score variance: $r = \\frac{\\sigma_T^2}{\\sigma_X^2}$.\n6.  Since $\\sigma_X^2 = \\sigma_T^2 + \\sigma_E^2$, we can substitute $\\sigma_T^2 = r \\sigma_X^2$ to solve for the error variance:\n    $$ \\sigma_X^2 = r \\sigma_X^2 + \\sigma_E^2 $$\n    $$ \\sigma_E^2 = \\sigma_X^2 - r \\sigma_X^2 = \\sigma_X^2 (1 - r) $$\n7.  The square root of the error variance is the standard error of measurement ($SE_m$):\n    $$ SE_m = \\sigma_E = \\sqrt{\\sigma_X^2 (1 - r)} = \\sigma_X \\sqrt{1 - r} $$\n8.  Assuming the standard error of measurement is constant across the two measurement occasions (i.e., $\\sigma_{E_1}^2 = \\sigma_{E_2}^2 = \\sigma_E^2$), the variance of the difference score error becomes:\n    $$ \\sigma_{diff_E}^2 = \\sigma_E^2 + \\sigma_E^2 = 2 \\sigma_E^2 = 2 \\sigma_X^2 (1 - r) $$\n9.  The standard error of the difference, $SE_{diff}$, is the square root of this variance:\n    $$ SE_{diff} = \\sqrt{2 \\sigma_X^2 (1 - r)} = \\sigma_X \\sqrt{2(1 - r)} $$\n10. Substituting this expression for $SE_{diff}$ back into the RCI formula, we obtain the final form. The problem provides the standard deviation, $SD$, which is the sample estimate of $\\sigma_X$.\n    $$ RCI = \\frac{X_2 - X_1}{SD \\sqrt{2(1 - r)}} $$\n\n**Calculation:**\n\nWe are given the following parameters for the child-report SCARED:\n- Pre-treatment score: $X_1 = 42$\n- Post-treatment score: $X_2 = 28$\n- Normative standard deviation: $SD = 10.5$\n- Test-retest reliability: $r = 0.86$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived formula:\n\n1.  Calculate the change in score:\n    $$ X_2 - X_1 = 28 - 42 = -14 $$\n2.  Calculate the standard error of the difference ($SE_{diff}$):\n    $$ SE_{diff} = SD \\sqrt{2(1 - r)} = 10.5 \\sqrt{2(1 - 0.86)} $$\n    $$ SE_{diff} = 10.5 \\sqrt{2(0.14)} $$\n    $$ SE_{diff} = 10.5 \\sqrt{0.28} $$\n    The numerical value for $\\sqrt{0.28}$ is approximately $0.52915026$.\n    $$ SE_{diff} \\approx 10.5 \\times 0.52915026 \\approx 5.55607775 $$\n3.  Calculate the RCI:\n    $$ RCI = \\frac{-14}{SE_{diff}} \\approx \\frac{-14}{5.55607775} \\approx -2.519754 $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$ RCI \\approx -2.520 $$\n\nA negative RCI indicates a decrease in the score, which for a symptom measure like the SCARED represents clinical improvement. The magnitude $|-2.520| = 2.520$ exceeds the conventional threshold of $1.96$, which corresponds to a change that is statistically reliable at the $p < 0.05$ level. This suggests that the observed reduction in anxiety symptoms is unlikely to be attributable to measurement error alone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-2.520}$$", "id": "4758013"}]}
