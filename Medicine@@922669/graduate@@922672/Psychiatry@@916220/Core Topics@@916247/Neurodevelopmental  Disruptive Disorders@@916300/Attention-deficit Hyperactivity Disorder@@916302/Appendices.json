Normal sleep of $7$ to $8$ hours per night.\n- **Exclusionary Information**:\n    - Substance Use: Patient denies substance use preceding elevated mood episodes; urine toxicology was negative during one such episode.\n    - Developmental History: Patient denies persistent inattention or hyperactivity before age $12$. Average school performance, no teacher reports of behavioral issues.\n- **Treatment History**: A trial of methylphenidate ($20$ mg daily) was ineffective for presumed attentional issues and worsened irritability/restlessness during an elevated period.\n- **Family History**: Father treated with lithium for “mood swings.”\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Groundedness**: The problem is grounded in clinical psychiatry. The terminology used (e.g., racing thoughts, anhedonia, hypersomnia, methylphenidate, lithium) and the symptom clusters presented are standard in psychiatric nosology, consistent with diagnostic manuals such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5).\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem asks for the single best diagnosis based on a detailed clinical vignette. The provided information is specific and sufficient to perform a differential diagnosis and arrive at a unique, most probable answer among the given choices.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem statement is presented as a factual case history, using objective and clinical language. It is free from subjective claims or biases.\n- **Flaw Analysis**:\n    1.  **Scientific/Factual Unsoundness**: The presentation is a classic and realistic clinical scenario for a mood disorder. It does not violate any established scientific principles.\n    2.  **Incomplete/Contradictory Setup**: The vignette is comprehensive, providing positive and negative findings, family history, and treatment response, all of which are crucial for psychiatric diagnosis. There are no internal contradictions.\n    3.  **Unrealistic/Infeasible**: The described frequency, duration, and symptomatology of the mood episodes are entirely plausible and commonly encountered in clinical practice.\n    4.  **Ill-Posed/Poorly Structured**: The question is well-structured, requiring the application of standardized diagnostic criteria to a given set of facts, which leads to a single best conclusion.\n    5.  **Other Flaws**: The problem is neither trivial nor pseudo-profound; it requires specific knowledge to differentiate between related psychiatric conditions. It is not unverifiable, as it can be assessed against standard diagnostic criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective clinical vignette suitable for diagnostic assessment. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe solution requires a systematic application of diagnostic criteria to the patient's history and symptoms. The DSM-5 criteria serve as the guiding framework.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Elevated Mood Episodes**:\n    - **Duration**: The episodes last for $5$ to $6$ days. The minimum duration for a hypomanic episode is $4$ consecutive days, and the minimum for a manic episode is $1$ week (or any duration if hospitalization is required). The duration criterion for a hypomanic episode is met.\n    - **Symptoms**: The patient exhibits racing thoughts (Criterion B4), rapid speech (Criterion B3), increased goal-directed activity (Criterion B6), decreased need for sleep (Criterion B2), and impulsive spending (Criterion B7). This meets the requirement for $\\geq 3$ symptoms (or $\\geq 4$ if mood is only irritable).\n    - **Severity**: The problem explicitly states there is no psychotic content and the patient has never been hospitalized. It does not mention \"marked impairment\" in functioning, which is a key criterion for a manic episode. The absence of these features, combined with the episode duration, is definitional for a **hypomanic episode**.\n    - **Conclusion**: The patient experiences recurrent hypomanic episodes.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Depressed Mood Episodes**:\n    - **Criteria**: The text explicitly states that the patient experiences periods of depression with \"functional impairment meeting criteria for a **major depressive episode**\" (MDE). Symptoms listed (depressed mood, anhedonia, hypersomnia, diminished concentration, worthlessness) for a duration of $2$ to $3$ weeks are fully consistent with an MDE.\n    - **Conclusion**: The patient has a history of at least one MDE.\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Differential Diagnosis**:\n    - The core diagnostic feature is the presence of at least one hypomanic episode and at least one major depressive episode.\n    - Crucially, there has **never** been a full manic episode.\n    - These criteria (hypomania + MDE, no mania) are the specific definition of **Bipolar II Disorder**.\n    - The family history of a father treated with lithium (a first-line mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder) for \"mood swings\" provides strong genetic and clinical support for a bipolar spectrum diagnosis.\n    - The negative response to methylphenidate (worsened irritability/restlessness) is a known clinical phenomenon where stimulants can destabilize mood or induce/worsen manic/hypomanic symptoms in individuals with bipolar disorder.\n    - The absence of a persistent pattern of inattention/hyperactivity from childhood (before age $12$) definitively rules out ADHD as the primary diagnosis.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, combined presentation**\n- This diagnosis requires a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity with onset of several symptoms before age $12$. The patient explicitly denies this history. The symptoms are episodic and linked to mood states, not a persistent developmental trait.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**B. Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic**\n- Bipolar I Disorder is defined by the presence of at least one manic episode. A manic episode involves severe mood disturbance causing marked impairment, hospitalization, or psychotic features. This patient's elevated episodes do not meet this severity threshold and are thus classified as hypomanic.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. Bipolar II Disorder**\n- This diagnosis requires at least one hypomanic episode and at least one major depressive episode, with the absence of any history of a full manic episode. The patient's clinical presentation precisely matches these criteria. The course of illness, family history, and response to stimulant medication further corroborate this diagnosis.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**D. Cyclothymic Disorder**\n- Cyclothymic Disorder involves numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms that do **not** meet the full criteria for a hypomanic or major depressive episode, respectively, over at least a $2$-year period. This patient experiences full-criteria hypomanic episodes and full-criteria major depressive episodes, which excludes a diagnosis of cyclothymia and points towards Bipolar II Disorder.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. Substance/medication-induced bipolar-like disorder**\n- This diagnosis is ruled out by the explicit statement that substance use does not precede the episodes and a urine toxicology screen was negative. Furthermore, the mood disorder predates the trial of methylphenidate; the medication did not induce the disorder but rather exacerbated symptoms of a pre-existing episode.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4690613"}, {"introduction": "Moving from clinical description to cognitive neuroscience, we can objectively measure the core deficits of ADHD. Impaired inhibitory control, or the difficulty in stopping an already initiated action, is a central feature of the disorder. This exercise introduces the Stop-Signal Task and the influential \"horse-race model,\" allowing you to derive the Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT), a key quantitative biomarker of inhibitory control, from its theoretical foundation [@problem_id:4690631]. Mastering this concept provides insight into how experimental paradigms translate abstract clinical constructs into precise, testable metrics.", "problem": "A common laboratory measure of inhibitory control relevant to Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the Stop-Signal Task (SST). The independent horse-race model posits two stochastically independent processes: a Go process with finishing time random variable $T_{G}$, and a Stop process with finishing time random variable $T_{S}$. A response occurs on a stop-signal trial presented after a stop-signal delay (SSD) of $d$ if and only if the Go process finishes before the Stop process plus the delay, that is, when $T_{G}  T_{S} + d$. The Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) is defined as the central tendency (treated here as a constant for derivation) of the unobservable finishing time of the Stop process, while the Stop-Signal Delay (SSD) is the experimentally controlled delay $d$ between Go onset and Stop onset. Assume the following well-tested facts: the Go reaction time distribution has a cumulative distribution function $F_{G}(t)$; a staircase tracking procedure adjusts $d$ to maintain the probability of successful inhibition near $0.5$ across stop trials; and independence holds between the Go and Stop processes with no post-stop-signal slowing and stationary behavior across trials.\n\nStarting from the independent horse-race model event definition and the above facts, derive a closed-form expression for the Stop-Signal Reaction Time in terms of the Go finishing-time quantile and the Stop-Signal Delay that would be maintained by a staircase procedure targeting a $0.5$ inhibition rate.

It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. The problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem is solved in two parts as requested: first, a general derivation of the Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT), and second, a numerical calculation based on the provided empirical values.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the SSRT Expression**\n\nThe independent horse-race model states that on a stop-signal trial, a response is made if the Go process finishes before the Stop process. The Stop process is initiated with a delay $d$, the Stop-Signal Delay (SSD). The event of responding (i.e., unsuccessful inhibition) is therefore given by the inequality:\n$$\nT_{G}  T_{S} + d\n$$\nwhere $T_{G}$ is the random variable for the Go process finishing time and $T_{S}$ is the random variable for the Stop process finishing time.\n\nThe problem directs us to treat the SSRT as a constant representing the central tendency of the Stop process finishing time, $T_{S}$. We will denote this constant by the symbol $\\text{SSRT}$. The inequality for responding thus becomes:\n$$\nT_{G}  \\text{SSRT} + d\n$$\nThe probability of this event, $P(\\text{respond})$, is $P(T_{G}  \\text{SSRT} + d)$.\n\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Go reaction time, $F_{G}(t)$, is defined as $F_{G}(t) = P(T_{G} \\leq t)$. For a continuous random variable like reaction time, the probability at a single point is zero, so $P(T_{G} \\leq t) = P(T_{G}  t)$. Therefore, the probability of responding can be expressed in terms of the Go CDF:\n$$\nP(\\text{respond}) = P(T_{G}  \\text{SSRT} + d) = F_{G}(\\text{SSRT} + d)\n$$\nThe problem states that a staircase tracking procedure is used to adjust the delay $d$ such that the probability of successful inhibition is maintained near $0.5$. Successful inhibition is the event $T_G \\ge T_S + d$. Therefore, $P(\\text{successful inhibition}) = 1 - P(\\text{respond}) \\approx 0.5$. This directly implies that the probability of responding is also maintained near $0.5$:\n$$\nP(\\text{respond}) = F_{G}(\\text{SSRT} + d) \\approx 0.5\n$$\nThis equation indicates that the value $\\text{SSRT} + d$ corresponds to the point in the Go reaction time distribution where the cumulative probability is $0.5$. This point is, by definition, the median of the Go reaction time distribution. Let $Q_{G}(p)$ be the quantile function of the Go reaction time distribution, which is the inverse of the CDF, $Q_{G}(p) = F_{G}^{-1}(p)$. The median is the $p=0.5$ quantile, $Q_{G}(0.5)$.\n\nFrom the equation $F_{G}(\\text{SSRT} + d) = 0.5$, we can apply the inverse function $Q_{G}$ to both sides:\n$$\n\\text{SSRT} + d = Q_{G}(0.5)\n$$\nSolving for SSRT, we obtain the closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\text{SSRT} = Q_{G}(0.5) - d\n$$\nThis expression defines the SSRT in terms of the median (the $0.5$ quantile) of the Go finishing-time distribution and the mean Stop-Signal Delay $d$ that the staircase procedure converges to.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the SSRT**\n\nWe now use the derived expression and the provided empirical values to compute the SSRT.\nThe problem supplies the following:\n1.  The mean Go reaction time is $400$ milliseconds.\n2.  The mean Stop-Signal Delay is $200$ milliseconds. This corresponds to the value of $d$ in our formula, as it is the delay the staircase procedure stabilizes around. So, $d = 200$ ms.\n3.  An additional assumption is that the Go reaction time distribution is approximately symmetric. For any symmetric probability distribution, the mean is equal to the median.\n\nGiven the symmetry assumption, the median of the Go reaction time distribution is equal to its mean.\n$$\n\\text{Median Go RT} = Q_{G}(0.5) = \\text{Mean Go RT} = 400 \\text{ ms}\n$$\nWe can now substitute the values for the Go RT median and the mean SSD into our derived formula:\n$$\n\\text{SSRT} = Q_{G}(0.5) - d\n$$\n$$\n\\text{SSRT} = 400 \\text{ ms} - 200 \\text{ ms}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{SSRT} = 200 \\text{ ms}\n$$\nThe calculated Stop-Signal Reaction Time is $200$ milliseconds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{200}$$", "id": "4690631"}, {"introduction": "The principles of diagnosis and assessment must be adapted when scaling from the individual patient to population-level public health initiatives.

The problem is a formalizable application of probability theory to a realistic public health screening scenario.

Let $Y$ be the random variable representing this total number. The total population is $N = 1200$ children. We can define an indicator random variable $Y_i$ for each child $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$, where $Y_i=1$ if child $i$ receives a final positive diagnosis, and $Y_i=0$ otherwise. The total number is the sum of these indicators: $Y = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i$.\n\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected total number is the sum of the individual expectations:\n$$E[Y] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[Y_i]$$\nSince each child is subject to the same independent probabilistic process, the expectation $E[Y_i]$ is the same for all children. $E[Y_i]$ is the probability that child $i$ receives a final positive diagnosis.

A child receives a final positive diagnosis if they proceed through the entire sequence: consenting, screening positive at Stage $1$, attending the Stage $2$ assessment, and being classified as positive at Stage $2$.\n\nLet us define the relevant events for a single, randomly selected child:\n- $D$: The child has ADHD (true disease status is positive).\n- $D^c$: The child does not have ADHD (true disease status is negative).\n- $C$: The family consents to participate in screening.\n- $S_1^+$: The child screens positive at Stage $1$.\n- $A_2$: The child attends the Stage $2$ assessment.\n- $S_2^+$: The child is classified as positive at Stage $2$.\n\nThe probability $\\pi$ is the probability of the intersection of these events: $\\pi = P(C \\cap S_1^+ \\cap A_2 \\cap S_2^+)$.\n\nWe can calculate this probability by conditioning on the true disease status of the child using the Law of Total Probability:\n$$\\pi = P(C \\cap S_1^+ \\cap A_2 \\cap S_2^+ | D)P(D) + P(C \\cap S_1^+ \\cap A_2 \\cap S_2^+ | D^c)P(D^c)$$\n\nThe problem provides the following probabilities:\n- Prevalence: $P(D) = p = 0.07$, so $P(D^c) = 1-p = 0.93$.\n- Consent: $P(C) = r = 0.85$.\n- Stage $1$ Sensitivity: $P(S_1^+|D) = s_1 = 0.80$.\n- Stage $1$ Specificity: $P(S_1^-|D^c) = c_1 = 0.90$, which implies $P(S_1^+|D^c) = 1-c_1 = 0.10$.\n- Stage $2$ Attendance: $P(A_2|S_1^+) = a = 0.75$.\n- Stage $2$ Sensitivity: $P(S_2^+|D) = s_2 = 0.95$.\n- Stage $2$ Specificity: $P(S_2^-|D^c) = c_2 = 0.98$, which implies $P(S_2^+|D^c) = 1-c_2 = 0.02$.\n\nThe problem states several independence conditions. We expand the conditional probability terms using the chain rule for probabilities.\nFor a child with ADHD (event $D$):\n$$P(C \\cap S_1^+ \\cap A_2 \\cap S_2^+ | D) = P(C|D) \\cdot P(S_1^+|D, C) \\cdot P(A_2|D, C, S_1^+) \\cdot P(S_2^+|D, C, S_1^+, A_2)$$\nApplying the stated independence assumptions:\n- Consent is independent of ADHD status: $P(C|D) = P(C) = r$.\n- Stage $1$ screening depends only on disease status: $P(S_1^+|D, C) = P(S_1^+|D) = s_1$.\n- Stage $2$ attendance depends only on the Stage $1$ result: $P(A_2|D, C, S_1^+) = P(A_2|S_1^+) = a$.\n- Stage $2$ diagnosis depends only on disease status (given attendance): $P(S_2^+|D, C, S_1^+, A_2) = P(S_2^+|D) = s_2$.\nTherefore, for a child with ADHD, the probability of the full sequence is:\n$$P(C \\cap S_1^+ \\cap A_2 \\cap S_2^+ | D) = r \\cdot s_1 \\cdot a \\cdot s_2$$\n\nSimilarly, for a child without ADHD (event $D^c$):\n$$P(C \\cap S_1^+ \\cap A_2 \\cap S_2^+ | D^c) = P(C|D^c) \\cdot P(S_1^+|D^c, C) \\cdot P(A_2|D^c, C, S_1^+) \\cdot P(S_2^+|D^c, C, S_1^+, A_2)$$\nApplying the same independence logic:\n- $P(C|D^c) = P(C) = r$.\n- $P(S_1^+|D^c, C) = P(S_1^+|D^c) = 1-c_1$.\n- $P(A_2|D^c, C, S_1^+) = P(A_2|S_1^+) = a$.\n- $P(S_2^+|D^c, C, S_1^+, A_2) = P(S_2^+|D^c) = 1-c_2$.\nTherefore, for a child without ADHD, the probability is:\n$$P(C \\cap S_1^+ \\cap A_2 \\cap S_2^+ | D^c) = r \\cdot (1-c_1) \\cdot a \\cdot (1-c_2)$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions back into the Law of Total Probability for $\\pi$:\n$$\\pi = (r s_1 a s_2)p + (r(1-c_1)a(1-c_2))(1-p)$$\nWe can factor out the common terms $r$ and $a$:\n$$\\pi = ra [s_1 s_2 p + (1-c_1)(1-c_2)(1-p)]$$\n\nFinally, the expected total number of children with a final positive diagnosis is $E[Y] = N\\pi$:\n$$E[Y] = Nra [s_1 s_2 p + (1-c_1)(1-c_2)(1-p)]$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n- $N = 1200$\n- $p = 0.07$\n- $r = 0.85$\n- $s_1 = 0.80$\n- $c_1 = 0.90 \\implies 1-c_1 = 0.10$\n- $a = 0.75$\n- $s_2 = 0.95$\n- $c_2 = 0.98 \\implies 1-c_2 = 0.02$\n\n$$E[Y] = 1200 \\cdot 0.85 \\cdot 0.75 \\cdot [(0.80 \\cdot 0.95 \\cdot 0.07) + (0.10 \\cdot 0.02 \\cdot (1-0.07))]$$\n$$E[Y] = 765 \\cdot [(0.76 \\cdot 0.07) + (0.002 \\cdot 0.93)]$$\n$$E[Y] = 765 \\cdot [0.0532 + 0.00186]$$\n$$E[Y] = 765 \\cdot [0.05506]$$\n$$E[Y] = 42.1209$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$E[Y] \\approx 42.12$$\nThis result represents the expected number of children who are true positives and are correctly identified ($Npr s_1 a s_2 = 40.698$) plus the expected number of children who are true negatives but are incorrectly identified as positive ($N(1-p)r(1-c_1)a(1-c_2) = 1.4229$).
