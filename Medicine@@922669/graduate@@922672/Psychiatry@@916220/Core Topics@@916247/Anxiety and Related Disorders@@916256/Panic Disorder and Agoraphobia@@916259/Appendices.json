Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid and a full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nLet $D^+$ denote the event that an individual has panic disorder, and let $D^-$ denote the event that an individual does not have panic disorder. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result (PDSS score $\\ge 8$), and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result (PDSS score $< 8$).\n\nThe provided information can be expressed in terms of conditional probabilities:\n- Prevalence: $P(D^+) = P = 0.03$. Consequently, $P(D^-) = 1 - P(D^+) = 1 - 0.03 = 0.97$.\n- Sensitivity: $Se = P(T^+ | D^+)$, the probability of a positive test given the disease is present. $Se = 0.85$.\n- Specificity: $Sp = P(T^- | D^-)$, the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent. $Sp = 0.80$.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can also define the false negative rate and false positive rate:\n- False Negative Rate: $P(T^- | D^+) = 1 - P(T^+ | D^+) = 1 - Se$.\n- False Positive Rate: $P(T^+ | D^-) = 1 - P(T^- | D^-) = 1 - Sp$.\n\nThe quantities to be derived are:\n- Positive Predictive Value: $PPV = P(D^+ | T^+)$\n- Negative Predictive Value: $NPV = P(D^- | T^-)$\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem, which states for events $A$ and $B$: $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$. We also use the law of total probability, which states $P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c)$ for a complementary event $A^c$.\n\n**Derivation of PPV**\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the Positive Predictive Value is:\n$PPV = P(D^+ | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D^+) P(D^+)}{P(T^+)}$\n\nThe numerator is the product of sensitivity and prevalence: $P(T^+ | D^+) P(D^+) = Se \\cdot P$.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test. Using the law of total probability, we expand this term over the two states of disease (present or absent):\n$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D^+) P(D^+) + P(T^+ | D^-) P(D^-)$\nSubstituting the defined terms:\n$P(T^+) = (Se \\cdot P) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P))$\n\nCombining the numerator and denominator gives the expression for $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot P}{(Se \\cdot P) + (1 - Sp)(1 - P)}$$\n\n**Derivation of NPV**\nSimilarly, for the Negative Predictive Value, Bayes' theorem gives:\n$NPV = P(D^- | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^-) P(D^-)}{P(T^-)}$\n\nThe numerator is the product of specificity and the probability of not having the disease: $P(T^- | D^-) P(D^-) = Sp \\cdot (1 - P)$.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the overall probability of a negative test. Using the law of total probability:\n$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^-) P(D^-) + P(T^- | D^+) P(D^+)$\nSubstituting the defined terms:\n$P(T^-) = (Sp \\cdot (1 - P)) + ((1 - Se) \\cdot P)$\n\nCombining the numerator and denominator gives the expression for $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1 - P)}{(Sp \\cdot (1 - P)) + (1 - Se)P}$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are given:\n$Se = 0.85$\n$Sp = 0.80$\n$P = 0.03$\n\nWe also need:\n$1 - Se = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$\n$1 - Sp = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$\n$1 - P = 1 - 0.03 = 0.97$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived expressions.\n\nFor $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.85 \\times 0.03}{(0.85 \\times 0.03) + (0.20 \\times 0.97)} = \\frac{0.0255}{0.0255 + 0.194} = \\frac{0.0255}{0.2195} \\approx 0.11617312$$\nThis indicates that for a patient who screens positive, the probability of actually having panic disorder is approximately $11.6\\%$.\n\nFor $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.80 \\times 0.97}{(0.80 \\times 0.97) + (0.15 \\times 0.03)} = \\frac{0.776}{0.776 + 0.0045} = \\frac{0.776}{0.7805} \\approx 0.99423446$$\nThis indicates that for a patient who screens negative, the probability of not having panic disorder is approximately $99.4\\%$.\n\n**Calculation of D**\nThe problem asks for the quantity $D = \\text{NPV} - \\text{PPV}$.\n$$D = 0.99423446 - 0.11617312 = 0.87806134$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to four significant figures.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary parameters are provided for a unique solution.\n\nThe Rescorla-Wagner model describes the change in associative strength, $\\Delta V$, on a given trial $n$. The formula is:\n$$ \\Delta V_n = (\\alpha\\beta)(\\lambda - V_{n-1}) $$\nwhere $V_{n-1}$ is the associative strength at the beginning of trial $n$ (or at the end of trial $n-1$), $\\lambda$ is the asymptotic or maximum possible associative strength supported by the unconditioned stimulus (US), and the term $\\alpha\\beta$ represents the product of the salience of the conditioned stimulus (CS), $\\alpha$, and the learning rate parameter associated with the US, $\\beta$.\n\nThe associative strength at the end of trial $n$, denoted $V_n$, is the sum of the strength from the previous trial and the change during the current trial:\n$$ V_n = V_{n-1} + \\Delta V_n $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta V_n$, we get the iterative formula for associative strength:\n$$ V_n = V_{n-1} + (\\alpha\\beta)(\\lambda - V_{n-1}) $$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nInitial associative strength, $V_0 = 1.0$.\nThe learning rate product, $\\alpha\\beta = 0.20$.\nThe trials are nonreinforced (extinction trials), which means the US is absent.

We can express $V_n$ directly in terms of the initial strength $V_0$ and the number of trials $n$:\n$$ V_n = V_0 (1 - \\alpha\\beta)^n $$\n\nWe need to compute the associative strength after $n=4$ consecutive trials.

After $4$ trials, the associative strength has been reduced to $V_4 = 0.4096$. This represents a substantial reduction (a decrease of nearly $60\\%$) in the patient's conditioned threat expectancy. However, the residual associative strength is not zero. This value of $0.4096$ indicates that a significant level of threat expectancy remains. Clinically, this means the patient's fear is not fully extinguished, and they would likely still experience considerable anxiety in the situation, albeit less than before therapy. This residual strength underscores the principle that extinction is not an unlearning of the original fear memory but the formation of a new, competing safety memory.

This final practice moves to the level of clinical trial analysis, focusing on the Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$), a highly intuitive measure of intervention efficiency.

Remission is defined using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) threshold established in prior validation studies.

We will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) for three active interventions compared to a control group in a clinical trial for panic disorder with agoraphobia. The outcome is a beneficial one: remission.\n\nFirst, let us define the relevant quantities. Let $P_{\\text{treat}}$ represent the proportion of patients who achieve remission in a given active treatment arm, and let $P_{\\text{control}}$ be the proportion of patients who achieve remission in the control arm. These proportions are estimates of the true probabilities of remission.\n\nThe problem uses the term Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR). Conventionally, \"risk\" refers to the probability of an adverse outcome. Let us define the adverse outcome as \"failure to achieve remission.\" The risk of this adverse outcome in the control group is $R_{\\text{control}} = 1 - P_{\\text{control}}$. The risk in the treatment group is $R_{\\text{treat}} = 1 - P_{\\text{treat}}$.\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is the absolute difference in the risk of this adverse outcome between the control and treatment groups:\n$$ \\text{ARR} = R_{\\text{control}} - R_{\\text{treat}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of remission proportions:\n$$ \\text{ARR} = (1 - P_{\\text{control}}) - (1 - P_{\\text{treat}}) = P_{\\text{treat}} - P_{\\text{control}} $$\nThis demonstrates that for a beneficial outcome, the ARR (defined based on the complementary adverse event) is equivalent to the Absolute Benefit Increase (ABI), which is the simple difference in the proportions of the beneficial outcome. This justifies using the difference in remission rates as the ARR.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the NNT from first principles. The NNT is defined as the average number of patients who must be treated with the active intervention to achieve one additional beneficial outcome (remission, in this case) compared to what would have been achieved with the control intervention.\n\nConsider a cohort of $N$ patients.\nIf these $N$ patients are given the active treatment, the expected number of remissions is $N \\times P_{\\text{treat}}$.\nIf these same $N$ patients were instead given the control intervention, the expected number of remissions would be $N \\times P_{\\text{control}}$.\nThe number of *additional* remissions gained by using the active treatment over the control for this cohort of $N$ patients is the difference between these two expected values:\n$$ \\text{Additional Remissions} = (N \\times P_{\\text{treat}}) - (N \\times P_{\\text{control}}) = N \\times (P_{\\text{treat}} - P_{\\text{control}}) $$\nRecognizing that $P_{\\text{treat}} - P_{\\text{control}}$ is the ARR, we have:\n$$ \\text{Additional Remissions} = N \\times \\text{ARR} $$\nTo find the NNT, we set the number of additional remissions to $1$ and solve for $N$. This value of $N$ will be the NNT.\n$$ 1 = \\text{NNT} \\times \\text{ARR} $$\n$$ \\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{\\text{ARR}} = \\frac{1}{P_{\\text{treat}} - P_{\\text{control}}} $$\nThis rigorous derivation confirms the standard formula for NNT for a beneficial outcome.\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the data provided in the problem. The proportion of remission in the control group is $P_{\\text{control}} = 0.25$. The study duration of $12$ weeks is contextual information but not used in the calculation.\n\n1.  **Combined Treatment (CBT + SSRI):**\n    The proportion of remission is $P_{\\text{combined}} = 0.60$.\n    The ARR is $\\text{ARR}_{\\text{combined}} = P_{\\text{combined}} - P_{\\text{control}} = 0.60 - 0.25 = 0.35$.\n    The NNT is $\\text{NNT}_{\\text{combined}} = \\frac{1}{0.35} \\approx 2.85714$.\n    Rounding to three significant figures, we get $2.86$.\n\n2.  **CBT Alone:**\n    The proportion of remission is $P_{\\text{CBT}} = 0.45$.\n    The ARR is $\\text{ARR}_{\\text{CBT}} = P_{\\text{CBT}} - P_{\\text{control}} = 0.45 - 0.25 = 0.20$.\n    The NNT is $\\text{NNT}_{\\text{CBT}} = \\frac{1}{0.20} = 5$.\n    To express this with three significant figures, we write $5.00$.\n\n3.  **SSRI Alone:**\n    The proportion of remission is $P_{\\text{SSRI}} = 0.40$.\n    The ARR is $\\text{ARR}_{\\text{SSRI}} = P_{\\text{SSRI}} - P_{\\text{control}} = 0.40 - 0.25 = 0.15$.\n    The NNT is $\\text{NNT}_{\\text{SSRI}} = \\frac{1}{0.15} = \\frac{1}{15/100} = \\frac{100}{15} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.6666...$.\n    Rounding to three significant figures, we get $6.67$.\n\n**Interpretation and Comparative Efficiency:**\nThe NNT provides a measure of the clinical efficiency of an intervention. A lower NNT indicates a more efficient treatment, as fewer patients need to be treated to observe one additional positive outcome.\n\n-   For the combined treatment, $\\text{NNT}_{\\text{combined}} = 2.86$. This means one must treat approximately $3$ patients with the combined therapy (CBT + SSRI) to achieve one more remission than would have occurred if those same patients had been in the control group.\n-   For CBT alone, $\\text{NNT}_{\\text{CBT}} = 5.00$. One must treat $5$ patients with CBT alone to achieve one additional remission compared to control.\n-   For SSRI alone, $\\text{NNT}_{\\text{SSRI}} = 6.67$. One must treat approximately $7$ patients with an SSRI alone to achieve one additional remission compared to control.\n\nComparing the NNT values, we have $2.86 < 5.00 < 6.67$. This indicates that the combined therapy is the most efficient intervention, followed by CBT alone, with SSRI alone being the least efficient of the three active treatments in producing additional remissions over the control condition.\n\nThe final results are presented in a single row matrix in the specified order: $(\\text{combined}, \\text{CBT}, \\text{SSRI})$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 2.86 & 5.00 & 6.67 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4736898"}]}
