He reports that for the past $18$ months, any scheduled flight triggers marked anticipatory anxiety beginning approximately $10$–$14$ days prior, characterized by intrusive imagery of mid-air mechanical failures, heightened autonomic arousal (palpitations, sweating), and difficulty concentrating at work. On the day of travel, he experiences a surge of fear while boarding and during takeoff, which sometimes culminates in a panic-level episode with shortness of breath, trembling, and a sense of impending doom. He has flown only $3$ times in the past $18$ months, each time using multiple safety behaviors: taking a benzodiazepine, insisting on an aisle seat, monitoring turbulence forecasts, and repeatedly rehearsing emergency procedures. He acknowledges that commercial air travel is statistically safe and that his reactions are stronger than he believes warranted by the actual risk.\n\nTo avoid flying, he has driven $8$–$12$ hours to attend two work conferences that were accessible by a $1.5$-hour flight and turned down a promotion that would have involved approximately $20\\%$ domestic air travel, citing fear of flying. He missed a family wedding across the country because he could not tolerate the idea of a long flight, and he reports significant distress during weeks when travel may be required. He rides buses and trains without anxiety, does not fear crowded places, and does not avoid theaters or malls. He denies recurrent unexpected panic attacks outside the context of flying. There is no history suggestive of trauma related to flights, and he denies symptoms consistent with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). He does not have pervasive, excessive worry across multiple life domains; his anxiety is situationally circumscribed to flying. Medical evaluation is unremarkable. He drinks coffee daily but denies misuse of substances. He is not currently taking a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI).\n\nUsing the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) framework for anxiety disorders, which of the following is the most accurate diagnostic conclusion?\n\nA.

The symptoms, behaviors, and differential diagnostic information are clinically realistic and described using standard psychiatric terminology. The problem is firmly grounded in the scientific framework of clinical psychiatry.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The question asks for the most accurate diagnosis based on the provided data and the DSM-5-TR framework. The data are sufficient, specific, and internally consistent, allowing for a rigorous application of diagnostic criteria to arrive at a unique conclusion among the given options.\n- **Objectivity**: The description is factual and observational, detailing the patient's reported experiences and behaviors without subjective or prejudicial language.\n\n**Verdict**: The problem is valid. It is a well-constructed, clinically sound, and objective question that can be answered by applying formal diagnostic criteria. Proceeding to solution.\n\n**Derivation of Diagnosis**\n\nThe analysis will proceed by sequentially evaluating the patient's presentation against the DSM-5-TR criteria for the anxiety disorders presented in the options.\n\nThe core diagnostic criteria for **Specific Phobia (300.29)** are as follows:\n- **(A) Marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation**: The patient exhibits marked fear of \"airplane travel.\" This criterion is met.\n- **(B) The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear or anxiety**: The patient experiences a \"surge of fear while boarding and during takeoff.\" This criterion is met.\n- **(C) The phobic object or situation is actively avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety**: The patient demonstrates significant avoidance (declined promotion, missed wedding, drove long distances) and endures flights with intense fear, necessitating safety behaviors (benzodiazepine, rehearsal of procedures). This criterion is met.\n- **(D) The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger**: The patient explicitly \"acknowledges that commercial air travel is statistically safe and that his reactions are stronger than he believes warranted.\" This criterion is met.\n- **(E) The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for $6$ months or more**: The symptoms have persisted for \"$18$ months.\" This criterion is met.\n- **(F) The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment**: The patient reports \"significant distress\" and shows clear occupational (declined promotion) and social (missed wedding) impairment. This criterion is met.\n- **(G) The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder**:\n    - **Panic Disorder**: The patient \"denies recurrent unexpected panic attacks.\" The panic symptoms are expected and cued by the phobic stimulus.\n    - **Agoraphobia**: The fear is specific to airplanes; he \"rides buses and trains without anxiety\" and does not fear other classic agoraphobic situations.\n    - **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**: The worry is \"situationally circumscribed to flying\" and not pervasive across \"multiple life domains.\"\n    - **PTSD**: There is \"no history suggestive of trauma related to flights.\"\nThis criterion is met. The specifier is **Situational Type**.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, the patient's presentation precisely matches the DSM-5-TR criteria for Specific Phobia, situational type.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Specific Phobia, situational type (flying), diagnosis warranted; safety behaviors and infrequent exposure do not preclude diagnosis given persistence ($\\geq 6$ months) and clinically significant impairment**\nThis statement is factually and clinically correct. The diagnosis of Specific Phobia is strongly supported by the evidence. The explanatory clause is also correct: avoidance (leading to infrequent exposure) and reliance on safety behaviors are characteristic features that support, rather than preclude, the diagnosis. The duration ($\\geq 6$ months) and impairment criteria are unequivocally met.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Panic Disorder; recurrent unexpected panic attacks with persistent concern or maladaptive avoidance for $\\geq 1$ month, triggered by flights**\nThis diagnosis is incorrect. The cardinal feature of Panic Disorder is the recurrence of *unexpected* panic attacks. The problem explicitly states the patient \"denies recurrent unexpected panic attacks.\" The panic-level episodes he experiences are cued by a specific situation (flying), which is a specifier for other anxiety disorders (like Specific Phobia), but does not itself warrant a diagnosis of Panic Disorder.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Agoraphobia; fear of being trapped without easy escape justifies diagnosis even if limited to airplanes**\nThis diagnosis is incorrect. The DSM-5-TR criteria for Agoraphobia require fear or anxiety about two or more of five specific types of situations. The patient's fear is explicitly noted to be limited to a single situation (airplanes), while he is comfortable in other situations like buses, trains, and crowds. This monophobia is characteristic of a Specific Phobia, not Agoraphobia.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. No anxiety disorder diagnosis; infrequent flights and reliance on safety behaviors prevent meeting criteria for clinically significant impairment**\nThis statement is incorrect. The patient's condition causes profound and \"clinically significant impairment,\" as evidenced by turning down a job promotion and missing a major family event. This constitutes substantial occupational and social impairment. The infrequency of flying is a *symptom* of the disorder (avoidance), not a reason to deny the diagnosis. Likewise, safety behaviors are coping mechanisms that indicate the presence of significant underlying anxiety.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Generalized Anxiety Disorder; anticipatory anxiety about upcoming flights reflects excessive worry across multiple domains for $\\geq 6$ months**\nThis diagnosis is incorrect. The defining feature of GAD is that the anxiety and worry are excessive, difficult to control, and pertain to a \"number of events or activities\" (i.e., multiple domains). The problem text explicitly contradicts this, stating the patient's anxiety is \"situationally circumscribed to flying\" and that he \"does not have pervasive, excessive worry across multiple life domains.\" The anticipatory anxiety described is content-congruent with the specific phobia.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4689024"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the clinical interview, modern assessment relies on quantitative tools, but interpreting their results is a crucial skill.

The values provided are realistic for a clinical screening tool. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution. Let $D$ be the event that the patient has Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and let $D^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have the disorder. Let $+$ denote the event of a positive test result (GAD-7 score $\\geq 10$) and $-$ denote a negative test result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we can formalize the given information:\nThe pretest probability of the disorder is $P(D) = 0.20$.\nThe probability of not having the disorder is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n\nSensitivity is the probability of a positive test given that the person has the disorder (the true positive rate).\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = P(+\\mid D) = 0.89 $$\n\nSpecificity is the probability of a negative test given that the person does not have the disorder (the true negative rate).\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = P(-\\mid D^c) = 0.82 $$\n\nWe are asked to find the post-test probability $P(D \\mid +)$, which is the probability that the patient has the disorder given a positive test result.\n\nBayes' theorem states that for two events $A$ and $B$, the conditional probability of $A$ given $B$ is:\n$$ P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A) P(A)}{P(B)} $$\n\nApplying this theorem to our problem, we have:\n$$ P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(+)} $$\nThe numerator, $P(+ \\mid D) P(D)$, represents the probability of a true positive event.

We still need to find $P(+ \\mid D^c)$, the probability of a positive test given that the person does not have the disorder (the false positive rate). This can be derived from the specificity. For a person without the disorder, the test can only be positive or negative.
