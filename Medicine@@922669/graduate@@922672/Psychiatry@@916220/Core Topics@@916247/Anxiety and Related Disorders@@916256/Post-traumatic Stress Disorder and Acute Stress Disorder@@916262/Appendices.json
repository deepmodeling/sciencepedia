Do not include units. No rounding is necessary.", "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in standard epidemiological principles, well-posed, and objective. It provides a self-contained and consistent setup for a calculation based on fundamental definitions.\n\nThe problem asks for two parts: first, a clear definition of incidence and prevalence as they relate to Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and second, the calculation of the expected number of new PTSD cases in the described cohort.\n\nPart 1: Definitions of Incidence and Prevalence\n\nIn the context of psychiatric epidemiology and specifically for PTSD, the concepts of incidence and prevalence are defined as follows:\n\nIncidence measures the occurrence of new cases of a disorder in a population over a specified period of time. It is a measure of the risk or rate of developing the condition. The key components are:\n- Numerator: The number of individuals who develop PTSD for the first time during a defined time interval.\n- Denominator: The total number of individuals in the population who were *at risk* of developing PTSD at the beginning of the time interval. Being \"at risk\" means they did not have PTSD at the start of the observation period but were susceptible to developing it.\n- Time Reference: Incidence is always defined over a duration (e.g., $1$-year incidence, $12$-month incidence).\nFor example, the $12$-month incidence of PTSD in a trauma-exposed cohort would be the number of people who receive a new PTSD diagnosis during those $12$ months, divided by the number of people in the cohort who were free of PTSD at the start of the year.\n\nPrevalence measures the proportion of individuals in a population who have a disorder at a specific point in time (point prevalence) or over a period of time (period prevalence). It is a measure of the total burden of the disorder in the population. The key components are:\n- Numerator: The total number of individuals who have an existing diagnosis of PTSD. This includes both new cases and pre-existing cases.\n- Denominator: The total number of individuals in the population at that point in time (for point prevalence) or during that period (for period prevalence). The denominator includes everyone, whether they have the disorder, are at risk, or are not at risk.\n- Time Reference: Prevalence can be defined for a single point in time (\"on January $1$st\") or over a period (\"during the year $2023$\").\nFor example, the point prevalence of PTSD on a given day would be the total number of people with a PTSD diagnosis on that day, divided by the total population size on that same day.\n\nIn summary, the fundamental distinction is that incidence tracks the appearance of *new* cases among a population *at risk*, while prevalence provides a snapshot of *all existing* cases within the *total population*.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of New PTSD Cases\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n- The total size of the cohort, $N = 10{,}000$.\n- The cohort is followed for a period of $T = 12$ months.\n- At baseline, all individuals are free of PTSD. This means the entire cohort is at risk of developing PTSD. Therefore, the number of individuals at risk at the start of the follow-up period is $N_{\\text{at risk}} = 10{,}000$.\n- The $12$-month incidence is given as $8\\%$. The problem specifies that this should be treated as a cumulative incidence (CI), which is synonymous with risk. Thus, $\\text{CI} = 8\\% = 0.08$.\n\nCumulative incidence is defined by the formula:\n$$ \\text{CI} = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases during a specified period}}{\\text{Number of individuals at risk at the beginning of the period}} $$\n\nLet $N_{\\text{new}}$ represent the number of new PTSD cases that arise during the $12$-month follow-up. Using the variables defined:\n$$ \\text{CI} = \\frac{N_{\\text{new}}}{N_{\\text{at risk}}} $$\n\nWe are asked to find $N_{\\text{new}}$. We can rearrange the formula to solve for $N_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$ N_{\\text{new}} = \\text{CI} \\times N_{\\text{at risk}} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\n$$ N_{\\text{new}} = 0.08 \\times 10{,}000 $$\n\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$ N_{\\text{new}} = 800 $$\n\nTherefore, the expected number of new PTSD cases that will arise during the $12$-month follow-up period in this cohort is $800$. The problem states that there is complete follow-up, which simplifies the calculation as no individuals are lost to follow-up, and the denominator remains the initial number of people at risk. The final answer must be a single integer, and our calculation yields exactly that.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{800}$$", "id": "4742341"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the population to the individual, the cornerstone of effective psychiatric care is accurate diagnosis.

An assessment is conducted at $t=14$ days post-event using a structured binary symptom inventory aligned with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) criteria for Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). By definition, ASD requires the presence of at least $9$ symptoms drawn from five categories—intrusion, negative mood, dissociation, avoidance, and arousal—beginning or worsening after the traumatic event, with the disturbance occurring within the interval from $3$ to $30$ days post-event. Counting rules for this assessment are: each distinct symptom counts once; duplicate recordings of the same symptom do not increase the count; any recorded symptom that is more parsimoniously explained by a substance, a medical condition, or a pre-existing mental disorder without post-event worsening is excluded. The inventory captures symptom presence within the last $7$ days (days $7$ through $14$ post-event).\n\nWithin this framework, the following symptom data were recorded:\n\n- Intrusion category recordings:\n  - Recurrent, involuntary, intrusive distressing memories ($1$ recording).\n  - Recurrent distressing dreams related to the event ($1$ recording).\n  - Dissociative reactions (flashbacks) ($1$ recording).\n  - Intense or prolonged psychological distress at trauma-related cues ($1$ recording).\n  - Marked physiological reactions to trauma-related cues: tachycardia to sirens ($1$ recording) and tachycardia to diesel odor ($1$ recording). These two recordings represent the same DSM-5-TR intrusion symptom and must be collapsed to a single distinct symptom.\n\n- Negative mood category recordings:\n  - Persistent inability to experience positive emotions, present on $5$ of the last $7$ days.\n\n- Dissociation category recordings:\n  - Altered sense of reality of surroundings or oneself (e.g., derealization), recorded on $3$ separate days.\n  - Reduced awareness of surroundings (“in a daze”), recorded once; the rater notes that this was coded separately but represents the same DSM-5-TR dissociative phenomenon as the altered sense of reality item and should be collapsed with it.\n  - Inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event (dissociative amnesia), $1$ recording.\n\n- Avoidance category recordings:\n  - Efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about the event ($1$ recording).\n  - Efforts to avoid external reminders: the patient did not attend a scheduled training near the crash site; however, documentation shows the absence was due to a work scheduling conflict unrelated to trauma reminders, and the behavior was not volitional avoidance.\n\n- Arousal category recordings:\n  - Sleep disturbance: fragmented sleep nightly; chart review documents a rotating night-shift schedule initiated $2$ days prior to the collision, with identical sleep disruption documented pre-event; no post-event worsening attributable to trauma ($1$ recording).\n  - Irritable behavior or aggressive behavior: new onset post-event, no intoxication or withdrawal noted ($1$ recording).\n  - Hypervigilance ($1$ recording).\n  - Problems with concentration: longstanding attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosed $5$ years prior; no noted post-event worsening ($1$ recording).\n  - Exaggerated startle response ($1$ recording).\n\nUsing only the definitional base stated above and the provided data, compute the exact number of valid, distinct ASD symptoms to be counted toward the DSM-5-TR threshold.
