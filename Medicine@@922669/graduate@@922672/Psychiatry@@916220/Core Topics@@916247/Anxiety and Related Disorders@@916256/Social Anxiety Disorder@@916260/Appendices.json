The terminology used (randomized controlled trial, placebo, SSRI, NNT, LSAS) and the metrics to be calculated are standard in medical statistics.

There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution requires the computation of two distinct metrics based on the provided trial data.\n\n**Part 1: Pooled Response Rate**\n\nThe pooled response rate, $R_{\\text{pooled}}$, is the total number of responders across both arms divided by the total number of participants in the trial.\n\nFirst, we calculate the absolute number of responders in each arm by multiplying the sample size of the arm by its observed response rate.\nLet $N_{\\text{resp,SSRI}}$ be the number of responders in the SSRI arm and $N_{\\text{resp,placebo}}$ be the number of responders in the placebo arm.\n\nThe number of responders in the SSRI arm is:\n$$N_{\\text{resp,SSRI}} = n_{\\text{SSRI}} \\times r_{\\text{SSRI}} = 400 \\times 0.52 = 208$$\n\nThe number of responders in the placebo arm is:\n$$N_{\\text{resp,placebo}} = n_{\\text{placebo}} \\times r_{\\text{placebo}} = 400 \\times 0.34 = 136$$\n\nThe total number of responders, $N_{\\text{resp,total}}$, is the sum of responders from both arms:\n$$N_{\\text{resp,total}} = N_{\\text{resp,SSRI}} + N_{\\text{resp,placebo}} = 208 + 136 = 344$$\n\nThe total number of participants in the trial, $N_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of participants from both arms:\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = n_{\\text{SSRI}} + n_{\\text{placebo}} = 400 + 400 = 800$$\n\nThe pooled response rate is the ratio of total responders to total participants:\n$$R_{\\text{pooled}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{resp,total}}}{N_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{344}{800}$$\n\nTo express this as a terminating decimal, we simplify the fraction:\n$$R_{\\text{pooled}} = \\frac{344 \\div 8}{800 \\div 8} = \\frac{43}{100} = 0.43$$\n\n**Part 2: Number Needed to Treat (NNT)**\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is a measure of treatment effect, representing the average number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional bad outcome (or, equivalently, to achieve one additional good outcome). It is the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR).\n\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction is the difference between the event rate in the experimental group (here, the response rate in the SSRI arm, $r_{\\text{SSRI}}$) and the event rate in the control group (the response rate in the placebo arm, $r_{\\text{placebo}}$).\n\n$$ARR = r_{\\text{SSRI}} - r_{\\text{placebo}}$$\n\nUsing the given values:\n$$ARR = 0.52 - 0.34 = 0.18$$\n\nThe NNT is the reciprocal of the ARR:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} = \\frac{1}{0.18}$$\n\nThe problem requires an exact fraction or terminating decimal. To find the exact fraction, we can write $0.18$ as $\\frac{18}{100}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{9}{50}$.\n\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{\\frac{9}{50}} = \\frac{50}{9}$$\n\nThis fraction corresponds to a repeating decimal ($5.555...$), so it must be left in its exact fractional form as per the problem constraints. A common convention in clinical practice is to round NNT up to the next whole number (i.e., $6$), but the problem explicitly forbids rounding.\n\nThe two requested values are the pooled response rate ($0.43$) and the NNT ($\\frac{50}{9}$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.43 & \\frac{50}{9} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4759810"}, {"introduction": "The ethical and scientific integrity of a clinical trial hinges on its design, particularly its ability to detect a true effect if one exists.

Let $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ be the population mean changes from baseline to $12$ weeks on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) for the cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) groups, respectively. The common population standard deviation of the change scores is $\\sigma$. The sample sizes in the two arms are allocated equally, so $n_1 = n_2 = n$.\n\nThe null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the two-sided alternative hypothesis ($H_1$) are formulated in terms of the population means:\n$$H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0$$\n$$H_1: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 \\neq 0$$\n\nThe test is based on the difference in sample means, $\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2$. Based on the problem's stated assumptions (independence, equal variances, and normal approximation via the central limit theorem), the sampling distribution of this difference is normal. The mean of the distribution is $E[\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2] = \\mu_1 - \\mu_2$, and its standard error ($SE$) is given by:\n$$SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}} = \\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}$$\n\nThe test statistic is formulated as a Z-statistic, based on the normal approximation:\n$$Z = \\frac{(\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2) - (\\mu_1 - \\mu_2)}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}}$$\n\nA Type I error occurs when a true null hypothesis is rejected. The probability of such an error is the significance level, $\\alpha$. For a two-sided test, we reject $H_0$ if the absolute value of the observed Z-statistic, calculated under the assumption that $H_0$ is true (i.e., $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0$), exceeds a critical value. This rejection region is defined by $|Z_{obs}| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$, where $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the $(1-\\alpha/2)$-quantile of the standard normal distribution. The problem specifies $\\alpha=0.05$, so we use $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$, and the critical value is $z_{1-0.025} = z_{0.975}$.\n\nStatistical power, designated as $1-\\beta$, is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. To calculate power, we must assume a specific alternative hypothesis is true. The problem defines this alternative through the standardized mean difference, Cohen’s $d$:\n$$d = \\frac{|\\mu_1 - \\mu_2|}{\\sigma}$$\nWe are given $d=0.5$. Without loss of generality, we can assume $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 > 0$, which implies that under the specific alternative, the true difference is $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = d\\sigma$.\n\nPower is the probability that the test statistic falls into the rejection region, given that this specific alternative is true.\n$$\\text{Power} = 1 - \\beta = P\\left(\\left| \\frac{\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}} \\right| > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\;\\bigg|\\; \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = d\\sigma \\right)$$\nTo evaluate this probability, we standardize the difference $\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2$ under the alternative hypothesis. The variable $Z_1 = \\frac{(\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2) - d\\sigma}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}}$ follows a standard normal distribution. We can rewrite the sample mean difference as $\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2 = Z_1 \\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}} + d\\sigma$. Substituting this into the rejection condition $|(\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2) / (\\sigma\\sqrt{2/n})| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ gives two disjoint events:\n1. $\\frac{Z_1 \\sigma\\sqrt{2/n} + d\\sigma}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2/n}} > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\implies Z_1 + d\\sqrt{n/2} > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\implies Z_1 > z_{1-\\alpha/2} - d\\sqrt{n/2}$\n2. $\\frac{Z_1 \\sigma\\sqrt{2/n} + d\\sigma}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2/n}} < -z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\implies Z_1 < -z_{1-\\alpha/2} - d\\sqrt{n/2}$\n\nThe total power is the sum of the probabilities of these two events. For conventional parameters, the argument of the second event, $-z_{1-\\alpha/2} - d\\sqrt{n/2}$, is a large negative number, making the probability of this event negligible. Therefore, the power can be accurately approximated by the probability of the first event alone:\n$$1 - \\beta \\approx P(Z_1 > z_{1-\\alpha/2} - d\\sqrt{n/2}) = 1 - \\Phi(z_{1-\\alpha/2} - d\\sqrt{n/2})$$\nwhere $\\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. This leads to the approximation $\\beta \\approx \\Phi(z_{1-\\alpha/2} - d\\sqrt{n/2})$.\nLet $z_\\beta$ be the quantile such that $\\Phi(z_\\beta) = \\beta$. Due to the symmetry of the standard normal distribution, $z_\\beta = -z_{1-\\beta}$. We can now set the argument of $\\Phi$ equal to $z_\\beta$:\n$$z_{1-\\alpha/2} - d\\sqrt{n/2} \\approx z_\\beta = -z_{1-\\beta}$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the sample size $n$:\n$$d\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2}} \\approx z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta}$$\n$$\\sqrt{n} \\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})}{d}$$\n$$n \\approx \\frac{2(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{d^2}$$\nThis is the general formula for the sample size per group for a two-sample comparison of means.\n\nWe now substitute the specific values provided in the problem to compute $n$:\n- Significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$. For a two-sided test, the corresponding normal quantile is $z_{1-0.05/2} = z_{0.975} \\approx 1.95996$.\n- Power $1-\\beta = 0.80$, which means the Type II error rate is $\\beta = 0.20$. The corresponding normal quantile is $z_{1-0.20} = z_{0.80} \\approx 0.84162$.\n- The standardized effect size is Cohen's $d = 0.5$.\n\nPlugging these values into the derived formula:\n$$n = \\frac{2(z_{0.975} + z_{0.80})^2}{(0.5)^2} \\approx \\frac{2(1.95996 + 0.84162)^2}{(0.5)^2}$$\n$$n \\approx \\frac{2(2.80158)^2}{0.25} \\approx \\frac{2(7.84885)}{0.25} \\approx \\frac{15.6977}{0.25} \\approx 62.7908$$\n\nSince the number of participants must be an integer, and the calculated sample size is a minimum required to achieve the desired power, we must round this value up to the next whole number.\n$$n = \\lceil 62.7908 \\rceil = 63$$\nThus, a minimum of $63$ participants are required in each of the two groups.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{63}\n$$", "id": "4759801"}, {"introduction": "Modern psychiatry increasingly uses quantitative models to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying mental disorders, a field known as computational psychiatry.

The fundamental principles to be used are the definition of conditional probability and the law of total probability.\n\nThe definition of the conditional probability of an event $A$ given an event $B$ is:\n$$ P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} $$\nApplying this definition to the events $N$ and $F$, we have:\n$$ P(N \\mid F) = \\frac{P(N \\cap F)}{P(F)} $$\nThe term in the numerator, $P(N \\cap F)$, is the joint probability of both $N$ and $F$ occurring.

Therefore, the event $F$ can be decomposed into two mutually exclusive events: $F \\cap N$ (neutral feedback and negative evaluation) and $F \\cap N^c$ (neutral feedback and no negative evaluation).\nThe law of total probability states:\n$$ P(F) = P(F \\cap N) + P(F \\cap N^c) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term, we have:\n$$ P(F \\cap N) = P(F \\mid N) P(N) $$\n$$ P(F \\cap N^c) = P(F \\mid N^c) P(N^c) $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(F)$ yields:\n$$ P(F) = P(F \\mid N) P(N) + P(F \\mid N^c) P(N^c) $$\nFinally, by substituting this complete expression for $P(F)$ into the denominator of our equation for $P(N \\mid F)$, we arrive at the full expression for Bayes' theorem derived from first principles:\n$$ P(N \\mid F) = \\frac{P(F \\mid N) P(N)}{P(F \\mid N) P(N) + P(F \\mid N^c) P(N^c)} $$\nNow we can compute the numerical value using the given data.\nThe givens are:\n$P(N) = 0.6$\n$P(F \\mid N) = 0.7$\n$P(F \\mid N^c) = 0.4$\n\nWe also need the probability of the complement of $N$, which is $P(N^c)$.
