To be a discerning consumer of psychiatric research, it is essential to move beyond simply asking \"Does it work?\" to \"How well does it work?\" This practice will guide you through calculating and interpreting Cohen's $d$, a standard measure of effect size, using hypothetical data from a randomized controlled trial to quantify the clinical impact of IPT. [@problem_id:4721076]", "problem": "A randomized controlled trial in major depressive disorder compared Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) with a control condition. Depressive symptom severity was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HDRS-17). Change scores were defined as endpoint minus baseline, so negative values indicate symptom reduction. In the IPT arm, the sample mean change was $-10$ with sample standard deviation $SD=6$ and sample size $n=60$. In the control arm, the sample mean change was $-5$ with $SD=6$ and $n=60$. Assuming independent samples and homoscedasticity (equal population variances across groups), and using the standard definition of the standardized mean difference based on the pooled within-group standard deviation, compute Cohen’s $d$ for IPT relative to control, where the sign is defined as IPT mean minus control mean. Round your answer to four significant figures. Then, based on conventional benchmarks for standardized mean differences, briefly interpret the magnitude in terms of clinical relevance for Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) in the context of depressive symptom change measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HDRS-17).", "solution": "Let the Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) group be designated as group $1$ and the control group as group $2$. The given data are:\n-\nIPT group (group $1$):\n- Mean change score: $\\bar{x}_1 = -10$\n- Sample standard deviation: $s_1 = 6$\n- Sample size: $n_1 = 60$\n\nControl group (group $2$):\n- Mean change score: $\\bar{x}_2 = -5$\n- Sample standard deviation: $s_2 = 6$\n- Sample size: $n_2 = 60$\n\nThe problem requires the computation of Cohen’s $d$, a standardized mean difference, defined as the difference between the two group means divided by the pooled standard deviation. The sign is specified as the IPT mean minus the control mean. The formula is:\n$$\nd = \\frac{\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2}{s_p}\n$$\nwhere $s_p$ is the pooled within-group standard deviation.\n\nThe formula for the pooled standard deviation, assuming homoscedasticity (equal population variances), is:\n$$\ns_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}\n$$\nWe substitute the given values into this formula:\n$$\ns_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(60 - 1)6^2 + (60 - 1)6^2}{60 + 60 - 2}}\n$$\n$$\ns_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{59 \\cdot 36 + 59 \\cdot 36}{118}}\n$$\n$$\ns_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\cdot (59 \\cdot 36)}{118}}\n$$\n$$\ns_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{118 \\cdot 36}{118}}\n$$\n$$\ns_p = \\sqrt{36} = 6\n$$\nIt is worth noting that when sample sizes and standard deviations are equal across groups ($n_1 = n_2$ and $s_1 = s_2$), the pooled standard deviation simplifies to the common standard deviation, i.e., $s_p = s_1 = s_2$. In this case, $s_p = 6$.\n\nNow, we can compute Cohen's $d$ using the means and the calculated pooled standard deviation. The problem specifies the difference as IPT mean minus control mean ($\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2$).\n$$\nd = \\frac{-10 - (-5)}{6}\n$$\n$$\nd = \\frac{-10 + 5}{6}\n$$\n$$\nd = \\frac{-5}{6}\n$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives approximately $-0.833333...$. The problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\n$$\nd \\approx -0.8333\n$$\nThe interpretation of the result is as follows. The sign of Cohen's $d$ is negative, which indicates that the mean change score for the IPT group ($\\bar{x}_1 = -10$) was lower than that of the control group ($\\bar{x}_2 = -5$). Since the change scores were defined as endpoint minus baseline for depressive symptoms, a negative value signifies symptom reduction. A more negative value indicates a greater reduction. Therefore, the negative sign of $d$ indicates that IPT was more effective at reducing depressive symptoms than the control condition.\n\nRegarding the magnitude, conventional benchmarks for Cohen's $d$ are: $|d| \\approx 0.2$ for a small effect, $|d| \\approx 0.5$ for a medium effect, and $|d| \\approx 0.8$ for a large effect. The calculated value of $|d| \\approx 0.8333$ is greater than $0.8$, which is conventionally interpreted as a large effect size. This suggests that the difference in symptom reduction between Interpersonal Psychotherapy and the control condition is not only statistically significant but also of substantial clinical relevance.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.8333}\n$$", "id": "4721076"}, {"introduction": "A therapist's most powerful tool is their conceptual map of a patient's distress.

In this case, the patient's symptoms began within $2$ weeks of a promotion, a classic **role transition**. She is struggling with the loss of her old, familiar role and the demands of the new one. The therapeutic strategy in IPT would be to explicitly name the Role Transition as the primary problem.

In this case, the promotion has activated latent conflicts. The history of \"inconsistent caregiving\" suggests a relational template where she must appease others to maintain attachment.

In IPT, the role-play is a cornerstone technique for helping patients practice new communication skills in a safe environment before applying them to their lives. This problem asks you to design a detailed role-play protocol that operationalizes IPT's principles of communication analysis and leads to a concrete, planned homework assignment, demonstrating the direct link between therapeutic process and interpersonal change. [@problem_id:4721138]", "problem": "A psychiatrist is conducting Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) in the mid-phase with a patient who has Major Depressive Disorder and is working on a role dispute at work. The patient reports an impending conversation with a coworker to renegotiate task boundaries and reduce late-day handoffs that have been undermining the patient’s evening childcare responsibilities. The therapist wants to use role-play to prepare the patient for the conversation and ensure learning transfers to an in vivo attempt. The therapist’s stance is supportive and focused on current interpersonal functioning, consistent with IPT’s disease model and problem-area framework. The therapist aims to adhere to IPT’s use of communication analysis and decision analysis, maintain focus on the here-and-now interpersonal context, and employ in vivo homework to enact interpersonal changes.\n\nWhich protocol best operationalizes an IPT-consistent approach that integrates setup, coaching, feedback, and transfer to homework, maximizing fidelity to IPT principles and the likelihood of in vivo generalization?\n\nA. The therapist collaborates to specify the upcoming conversation with the coworker, clarifies the interpersonal goal in concrete, observable terms, and maps the immediate interpersonal context and roles. The therapist invites the patient to play the patient’s role while the therapist plays the coworker, frames the role-play as a behavioral experiment, and brackets time. Coaching uses communication analysis: the therapist slows the exchange, examines turn-taking, word choice, tone, facial expression, and felt affect, and guides the patient to practice clear, direct “I” statements, requests, and negotiation moves while keeping the focus on the current relationship. Feedback is descriptive and specific, linking observed communication behaviors to the patient’s goals and affect, eliciting the patient’s self-assessment, and iteratively refining the script. Transfer includes a graded in vivo homework: scheduling the real conversation, anticipating facilitators and barriers, identifying supports, articulating a concrete success criterion, and planning a post-conversation debrief; the therapist requests the patient to note key phrases used and the coworker’s responses to inform the next session.\n\nB. The therapist asks the patient to complete a thought record, identify automatic thoughts and cognitive distortions about the coworker, and generate rational alternatives. Role-play is used to rehearse the alternative thoughts without focusing on interpersonal dynamics. Feedback centers on accuracy of cognitive restructuring. Homework consists of daily thought records and reframing statements, with the actual conversation left as optional.\n\nC. The therapist interprets the impending conversation as a repetition of unconscious conflicts with a parental imago, invites the patient to role-play with the therapist as the parental figure, and explores transference feelings and historical narratives. Coaching emphasizes uncovering latent meanings rather than observable communication. Feedback focuses on insight into childhood dynamics, and homework is journaling dreams and memories with no planned in vivo interpersonal action.\n\nD. The therapist provides a generic assertiveness script and instructs the patient to deliver it verbatim to various people, regardless of relationship context. Role-play cycles through multiple hypothetical partners rapidly to build exposure to confrontation. Feedback rates assertiveness intensity and encourages pushing discomfort thresholds. Homework prescribes massed exposures to social situations without planning the specific conversation or tailoring to the coworker relationship.\n\nSelect the single best option.", "solution": "The task is to identify the protocol that most accurately implements the principles of Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) for a patient focusing on a role dispute. The core principles to evaluate against are: focus on current interpersonal functioning, communication analysis, decision analysis, here-and-now context, and in vivo homework.\n\n**A.** This option demonstrates exceptionally high fidelity to the IPT model. It begins by clarifying the specific interpersonal problem (role dispute) and goal, consistent with IPT's problem-focused nature. The role-play is a textbook example of IPT's communication analysis, breaking down the interaction and guiding the patient to practice more adaptive communication. The feedback is collaborative and specific. Crucially, the homework is a planned, \"in vivo\" task that directly targets the identified problem area, including a mechanism for review, which ensures learning and transfer. This protocol is a comprehensive and accurate operationalization of all specified IPT principles.\n\n**B.** This option describes techniques from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). The use of \"thought records,\" \"automatic thoughts,\" and \"cognitive distortions\" is central to CBT, not IPT. The focus is on challenging cognitive content rather than modifying interpersonal behaviors, which contradicts IPT's fundamental premise.\n\n**C.** This option describes techniques from Psychodynamic Psychotherapy. The focus on \"unconscious conflicts,\" \"parental imago,\" \"transference,\" and \"historical narratives\" is the hallmark of psychodynamic therapy. IPT is explicitly a \"here-and-now\" therapy that avoids exploration of the developmental past or unconscious motivations.\n\n**D.** This option describes a generic behavioral skills training or exposure-based approach. The use of a \"generic script\" applied \"regardless of relationship context\" is antithetical to IPT, which meticulously tailors interventions to specific, significant relationships.
