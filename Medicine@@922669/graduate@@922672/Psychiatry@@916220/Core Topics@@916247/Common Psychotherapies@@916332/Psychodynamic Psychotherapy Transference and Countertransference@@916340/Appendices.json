The problem is a formalizable and relevant application of quantitative analysis within the specified field of psychiatry. We may, therefore, proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first step is to organize the provided counts into a contingency table.

This problem transitions from reliability to impact assessment, using the common metric of Cohen's $d$ to calculate the effect size of a training program designed to reduce therapist countertransference distress.

In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), therapists were assigned to either a TI training group or an active control training group. After $12$ weeks, each therapist’s average session rating on a standardized Countertransference Distress Scale (CDS) was computed; lower CDS indicates less distress. The TI group had a mean CDS of $0.9$ with a standard deviation of $0.6$ across $n=50$ therapists, and the control group had a mean CDS of $1.2$ with a standard deviation of $0.6$ across $n=50$ therapists.\n\nStarting from the standard definition of a standardized mean difference and using the pooled standard deviation under the equal-variance assumption, derive and compute the effect size known as Cohen’s $d$ for the TI group relative to the control group. Then, based on conventional thresholds for standardized mean differences in the clinical literature, interpret whether the magnitude suggests clinically meaningful change in the domain of psychodynamic psychotherapy focused on transference and countertransference.\n\nRound your numerical answer for Cohen’s $d$ to three significant figures and express it as a pure number with no units.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in standard statistical practice within clinical research, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language. No scientific, logical, or factual contradictions are present. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the effect size, specifically Cohen’s $d$, for the difference in mean Countertransference Distress Scale (CDS) scores between a Transference Interpretation (TI) training group and an active control group. This metric quantifies the magnitude of the difference in standardized units.\n\nThe problem specifies that the calculation must use the pooled standard deviation, which is appropriate under the assumption of equal variances between the two groups. The data provided supports this assumption, as both groups have an identical sample standard deviation.\n\nLet the TI training group be designated as Group $1$ and the control group as Group $2$. The provided data are:\n- TI Group (Group $1$): Mean score $\\bar{x}_1 = 0.9$, standard deviation $s_1 = 0.6$, sample size $n_1 = 50$.\n- Control Group (Group $2$): Mean score $\\bar{x}_2 = 1.2$, standard deviation $s_2 = 0.6$, sample size $n_2 = 50$.\n\nCohen's $d$ is defined as the difference between the two group means, divided by the pooled standard deviation, $s_p$.\n$$ d = \\frac{\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2}{s_p} $$\nThe negative sign in the resulting value will indicate that the mean of Group $1$ is lower than the mean of Group $2$.\n\nFirst, we must derive the value of the pooled standard deviation, $s_p$. The formula for $s_p$ for two independent groups is:\n$$ s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}} $$\nSubstituting the given values into this formula:\n$$ s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(50 - 1)(0.6)^2 + (50 - 1)(0.6)^2}{50 + 50 - 2}} $$\n$$ s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{49(0.36) + 49(0.36)}{98}} $$\n$$ s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times (49 \\times 0.36)}{98}} $$\n$$ s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{98 \\times 0.36}{98}} $$\n$$ s_p = \\sqrt{0.36} $$\n$$ s_p = 0.6 $$\nAs a point of verification, when both sample sizes and standard deviations are equal (i.e., $n_1 = n_2 = n$ and $s_1 = s_2 = s$), the formula for the pooled standard deviation simplifies to $s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{2(n-1)s^2}{2(n-1)}} = \\sqrt{s^2} = s$. In this case, $s_p = s = 0.6$, which confirms our calculation.\n\nNow, we compute Cohen's $d$ using the calculated pooled standard deviation:\n$$ d = \\frac{\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2}{s_p} = \\frac{0.9 - 1.2}{0.6} $$\n$$ d = \\frac{-0.3}{0.6} $$\n$$ d = -0.5 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Thus, we express the result as $d = -0.500$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret this value. The computed Cohen's $d$ is $-0.500$. The magnitude of the effect is $|d| = 0.500$. In clinical and behavioral sciences, conventional thresholds for interpreting the magnitude of Cohen's $d$ are:\n- $|d| \\approx 0.2$: Small effect\n- $|d| \\approx 0.5$: Medium effect\n- $|d| \\approx 0.8$: Large effect\n\nThe calculated value of $|d| = 0.500$ corresponds exactly to the threshold for a medium effect size. The negative sign indicates that the TI training group experienced, on average, lower CDS scores than the control group. Since lower scores indicate less distress, this is a favorable outcome. Therefore, the TI training is associated with a reduction in self-reported countertransference strain of a magnitude considered to be a \"medium\" effect. This suggests that the observed difference is not only statistically detectable but also of a magnitude that is likely to be clinically meaningful within the context of psychodynamic psychotherapy and the study of transference and countertransference phenomena.

This final practice brings our focus from the research sample to the single case, introducing the Reliable Change Index (RCI) as a method to determine if a patient's observed change in symptoms is statistically meaningful or simply a product of measurement error.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of classical test theory (CTT) and psychometrics, providing a well-posed question with all necessary data for a unique and meaningful solution. The provided values for the SCL-90-R GSI scores, standard deviation, and reliability are plausible and consistent with published norms for this instrument. The task is an objective application of a standard statistical procedure, the Reliable Change Index (RCI), to assess therapeutic change.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in determining whether an observed change in a patient's score on a psychological test is greater than what would be expected from measurement error alone. Classical test theory provides the framework for this analysis. According to CTT, an observed score, $X$, is composed of a true score, $T$, and a random error component, $E$, such that $X = T + E$.\n\nThe reliability of a test, denoted $r_{XX'}$, is the proportion of observed score variance ($\\sigma_X^2$) that is attributable to true score variance ($\\sigma_T^2$). This relationship is given by $r_{XX'} = \\frac{\\sigma_T^2}{\\sigma_X^2}$.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the standard error of measurement (SEM), which is the standard deviation of the error scores. It quantifies the typical amount of error in an individual's score. The formula for the SEM is:\n$$ SEM = \\sigma_X \\sqrt{1 - r_{XX'}} $$\nUsing the provided values:\n- Observed-score standard deviation, $\\sigma_X = 0.5$\n- Test-retest reliability, $r_{XX'} = 0.90$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$ SEM = 0.5 \\sqrt{1 - 0.90} $$\n$$ SEM = 0.5 \\sqrt{0.10} $$\n\nTo assess the change between two scores, we need the standard error of the difference ($S_{diff}$), which quantifies the expected variability in the difference between two scores from the same individual due to measurement error. The variance of the difference between two scores is the sum of their error variances, assuming the errors are independent. Therefore, the standard error of the difference is given by:\n$$ S_{diff} = \\sqrt{SEM_1^2 + SEM_2^2} $$\nAssuming the SEM is the same at both measurement occasions (a standard assumption in CTT), the formula simplifies to:\n$$ S_{diff} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot (SEM)^2} = SEM \\sqrt{2} $$\nSubstituting the expression for SEM, we get:\n$$ S_{diff} = (\\sigma_X \\sqrt{1 - r_{XX'}}) \\sqrt{2} = \\sigma_X \\sqrt{2(1 - r_{XX'})} $$\nNow, we can calculate the numerical value for $S_{diff}$:\n$$ S_{diff} = 0.5 \\sqrt{2(1 - 0.90)} $$\n$$ S_{diff} = 0.5 \\sqrt{2(0.10)} $$\n$$ S_{diff} = 0.5 \\sqrt{0.20} $$\n$$ S_{diff} \\approx 0.5 \\times 0.4472135955... $$\n$$ S_{diff} \\approx 0.2236067977... $$\n\nThe Reliable Change Index (RCI) is then calculated by dividing the observed difference in scores by the standard error of the difference. The RCI is essentially a $z$-score for the change. The formula is:\n$$ RCI = \\frac{X_2 - X_1}{S_{diff}} $$\nThe given scores are:\n- Pre-treatment score, $X_1 = 1.8$\n- Post-treatment score, $X_2 = 1.1$\n\nSubstituting the values into the RCI formula:\n$$ RCI = \\frac{1.1 - 1.8}{0.2236067977...} $$\n$$ RCI = \\frac{-0.7}{0.2236067977...} $$\n$$ RCI \\approx -3.130495168... $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final RCI value to four significant figures.\n$$ RCI \\approx -3.130 $$\n\nThe final step is to determine if this change is statistically reliable. This is accomplished by comparing the absolute value of the RCI to the critical value from the standard normal distribution for a two-tailed test at the specified significance level, $\\alpha = 0.05$. The critical $z$-value for a two-tailed test at $\\alpha = 0.05$ is $z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025}$, which is approximately $\\pm 1.96$.\n\nThe decision rule is:\n- If $|RCI| > 1.96$, the change is statistically reliable.\n- If $|RCI| \\le 1.96$, the change is not statistically reliable and may be attributed to measurement error.\n\nIn this case, $|RCI| = |-3.130| = 3.130$.\nSince $3.130 > 1.96$, we conclude that the observed decrease in the patient's GSI score is statistically reliable at the $\\alpha=0.05$ significance level.
