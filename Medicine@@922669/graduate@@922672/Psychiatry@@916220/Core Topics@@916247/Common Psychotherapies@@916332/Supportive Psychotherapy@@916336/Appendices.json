She recently lost her sibling and is facing possible eviction after falling behind on rent. She denies hallucinations or current delusions, and there is no suicidal intent.

The problem pertains to selecting a patient for supportive psychotherapy based on clinical vignettes and defined principles of psychiatric care.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n\n**Core Task**: Choose the patient from a set of three who is best matched for a course of supportive psychotherapy at the present time.\n\n**Patient Profiles**:\n1.  **Patient X (Ms. J)**: A 68-year-old woman with chronic schizophrenia, stable on a long-acting antipsychotic. She exhibits long-standing blunted affect and concrete thinking. She is experiencing recent stressors: loss of a sibling and potential eviction. She denies current hallucinations, delusions, or suicidal intent. She expresses low interest in insight-oriented therapy (\"digging into my past\") but seeks practical help (\"getting through the week,\" \"figuring out how to handle things\"). She is willing to engage in weekly sessions if they are practical.\n2.  **Patient Y (Mr. R)**: A 28-year-old software engineer with recurrent major depressive disorder, currently in partial remission on a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI). He has stable work performance, strong abstract reasoning, and a sustained wish for insight (\"understand why he repeats certain interpersonal patterns\"). He tolerates emotionally evocative discussion, is curious about inner conflicts, and explicitly seeks \"deeper, insight-oriented work.\"\n3.  **Patient Z (Ms. T)**: A 40-year-old woman with Bipolar I disorder. She presents with symptoms of an acute manic episode lasting 5 days: markedly reduced sleep, pressured speech, elevated mood, distractibility, and increased goal-directed but risky spending. She has limited insight and resists medication changes. Her stated goal for therapy is to \"channel this energy\" and \"convince my family I’m fine.\"\n\n**Psychotherapy Modality Principles**:\n1.  **Supportive Psychotherapy**:\n    *   **Goals**: Symptom reduction, bolstering adaptation and coping, strengthening reality testing and defenses.\n    *   **Therapist Role**: Active, utilizing techniques such as advice, praise, reassurance, problem-solving, and limit-setting.\n    *   **Focus**: Not on deep interpretive techniques.\n2.  **Exploratory/Insight-Oriented Therapies**:\n    *   **Patient Requirements**: Higher motivation for insight, intact reality testing, and greater capacity for mentalization/abstraction.\n3.  **General Contraindication**:\n    *   Acute states that impair attention, impulse control, or reality testing limit the feasibility of any structured psychotherapy.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement will now be validated against the required criteria.\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of clinical psychiatry and psychotherapy. The patient descriptions represent classic clinical presentations of schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder (mania). The definitions of supportive and insight-oriented psychotherapy are standard in the field. The contraindication for therapy in acute states is a fundamental principle of clinical management. The problem is scientifically and factually sound.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The question asks for the \"best match\" based on a set of clearly defined principles and patient characteristics. The provided information is sufficient to perform a logical analysis and comparison of the three cases, leading to a unique and meaningful solution.\n*   **Objective**: The language used is clinical, descriptive, and free of subjective bias. The patient vignettes and therapeutic principles are presented as factual data for the analysis.\n*   **Flaw Check**:\n    1.  **Scientific/Factual Unsoundness**: None detected.\n    2.  **Non-Formalizable/Irrelevant**: The problem is highly relevant to the topic of psychotherapy selection in psychiatry and is structured for formal analysis.\n    3.  **Incomplete/Contradictory Setup**: The information is sufficient and internally consistent.\n    4.  **Unrealistic/Infeasible**: The clinical scenarios are highly realistic.\n    5.  **Ill-Posed/Poorly Structured**: The structure allows for a clear, deductive solution.\n    6.  **Pseudo-Profound/Trivial**: The problem requires a nuanced application of multiple criteria to different cases, representing a genuine clinical reasoning challenge.\n    7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The reasoning process is based on verifiable clinical principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived by applying the provided psychiatric principles to the patient profiles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to identify which of the three patients—X, Y, or Z—is the best candidate for supportive psychotherapy, based on the provided definitions. I will analyze each patient's case against the criteria for supportive psychotherapy.\n\n**Analysis of Patient X (Ms. J)**:\n*   **Primary Goals**: Ms. J explicitly requests help with current, practical life problems: \"getting through the week\" and \"figuring out how to handle things\" (dealing with grief and potential eviction). These goals perfectly align with the supportive therapy objectives of bolstering adaptation and coping.\n*   **Motivation for Insight**: She has \"low interest in 'digging into my past',\" which makes her a poor candidate for exploratory therapy but an ideal one for a supportive approach that does not rely on deep interpretation.\n*   **Cognitive Capacity**: Her \"concrete thinking\" limits her ability to engage in abstract, insight-oriented work. Supportive therapy, with its focus on practical problem-solving, advice, and reassurance, is well-suited to this cognitive style.\n*   **Clinical State**: She is described as \"stable\" on her medication, with no acute psychosis. While she has a severe and persistent mental illness (schizophrenia), her current state does not preclude structured outpatient therapy. The goal of strengthening reality testing, a tenet of supportive therapy, is also relevant for patients with a history of psychosis.\n*   **Conclusion**: Patient X is an excellent match for supportive psychotherapy. Her expressed goals, cognitive style, and clinical needs align precisely with the definition provided.\n\n**Analysis of Patient Y (Mr. R)**:\n*   **Primary Goals**: Mr. R \"explicitly seeks deeper, insight-oriented work\" to \"understand why he repeats certain interpersonal patterns.\" His goal is to gain self-understanding, not immediate symptom reduction or practical problem-solving.\n*   **Motivation for Insight**: His motivation is high, as evidenced by his \"sustained wish to understand\" and \"curiosity about his inner conflicts.\"\n*   **Cognitive Capacity**: He possesses \"strong abstract reasoning\" and can \"tolerate emotionally evocative discussion.\"\n*   **Conclusion**: Patient Y's profile is the textbook definition of a suitable candidate for exploratory/insight-oriented psychotherapy. His goals and capacities are directly contrary to the focus of supportive psychotherapy. Therefore, he is a poor match for supportive therapy.\n\n**Analysis of Patient Z (Ms. T)**:\n*   **Clinical State**: Ms. T is presenting in an acute manic episode. The problem explicitly states that \"acute states impairing attention, impulse control, or reality testing limit the feasibility of any structured psychotherapy.\" Her symptoms—distractibility, pressured speech, risky behavior, and limited insight—confirm she is in such a state.\n*   **Insight and Goals**: Her \"limited insight\" is demonstrated by her resistance to medication and her belief that she is \"fine.\" Her stated therapeutic goals (\"channel this energy,\" \"convince my family I'm fine\") are products of her manic state and are not compatible with a collaborative therapeutic process. Her impaired reality testing makes structured psychotherapy unsafe and ineffective at this time.\n*   **Conclusion**: Patient Z is not a suitable candidate for *any* form of structured psychotherapy at this moment. The clinical priority is acute stabilization, primarily pharmacological. Attempting supportive psychotherapy would be inappropriate and potentially counterproductive.\n\n**Synthesis**:\nComparing the three patients, Patient X is the only one whose current clinical needs, stated goals, and cognitive capacities are well-matched to supportive psychotherapy. Patient Y is a candidate for a different modality (insight-oriented therapy). Patient Z is currently not a candidate for any structured psychotherapy due to her acute manic state. Therefore, Patient X is the best-matched patient.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Patient X (Ms. J)**: This option identifies Ms. J. As determined by the analysis above, her desire for practical help, disinterest in deep interpretation, concrete thinking style, and need for coping support make her the ideal candidate for supportive psychotherapy among the choices. This verdict is **Correct**.\n*   **B. Patient Y (Mr. R)**: This option identifies Mr. R. My analysis shows Mr. R explicitly seeks and is well-suited for insight-oriented therapy, not supportive therapy. His goals and psychological capacities are a mismatch for the supportive modality. This verdict is **Incorrect**.\n*   **C. Patient Z (Ms. T)**: This option identifies Ms. T. My analysis concluded that due to her acute manic state, impaired insight, and poor reality testing, she is not a suitable candidate for any structured psychotherapy at this time. This verdict is **Incorrect**.\n*   **D. Both A and B**: This option suggests both Patient X and Patient Y are good matches.

Goals:\n- Identify the unconscious childhood source of anxiety and fully resolve transference by interpreting resistance.\n- Eliminate all defense mechanisms within 6 sessions.\nMonitoring:\n- Rely on therapist qualitative impressions documented monthly; avoid symptom scales to prevent “medicalizing” anxiety; review dreams each session without structured ratings.\n\nC. Goals:\n- Achieve complete elimination of anxiety (SUDS = 0) at all times within 2 weeks.\n- Complete daily 2-hour exposure exercises without breaks regardless of distress.\nMonitoring:\n- Single end-of-treatment assessment at week 12 with a non-specific “global improvement” rating; no interim measures to avoid “contaminating” the process; discourage alliance check-ins to prevent “dependence.”\n\nD. Goals:\n- Restore full occupational and interpersonal functioning to premorbid levels by the next session.\n- Completely eliminate frustration outbursts within 1 week.\nMonitoring:\n- Rely solely on partner report every other month; cancel sessions if symptoms worsen to encourage “self-reliance”; avoid written plans to prevent “crutches.”\n\nE.

The task is to identify which of the provided options correctly operationalizes these principles.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   **Patient Data:**\n    -   Age: 32 years\n    -   Occupation: Software engineer\n    -   History: 7-year history of generalized anxiety\n    -   Symptoms: Chronic worry, muscle tension, difficulty sleeping, irritability under stress, task abandonment, frequent reassurance-seeking from partner (approximately 15 texts per day).\n    -   Medication: Stable dose of sertraline with partial response.\n    -   Status: Denies suicidality, intact reality testing.\n    -   Patient's Stated Goals: \"to not fall apart when things go wrong\" and \"to stay on track.\"\n\n-   **Therapeutic Framework and Principles:**\n    1.  **Modality and Focus:** Supportive psychotherapy focusing on stabilization, affect regulation, and coping.\n    2.  **Therapeutic Stance:** Empathic, structured, and collaborative.\n    3.  **Aims of Supportive Psychotherapy:**\n        -   Bolster adaptive functioning.\n        -   Relieve distress.\n        -   Enhance affect regulation and frustration tolerance.\n        -   Improve problem-solving.\n        -   Maintain the therapeutic alliance.\n    4.  **Operational Framework:**\n        -   Measurement-based care.\n        -   Specific-Measurable-Achievable-Relevant-Time-bound (SMART) goal setting.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in established principles of psychiatry and psychotherapy. Supportive psychotherapy is a recognized modality. The described aims (e.g., bolstering adaptive functioning, enhancing affect regulation) are standard tenets of this therapy. Measurement-based care and SMART goal setting are evidence-based, mainstream practices in modern mental healthcare. The clinical vignette of a patient with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is realistic and internally consistent.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear set of 'first principles' (the aims of supportive therapy and the SMART framework) and asks the user to apply these principles to evaluate a set of options. This allows for a unique and logical determination of which option(s) correctly apply the given framework.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem statement is objective, presenting a clinical case and a set of established therapeutic principles without subjective or biased language.\n\n-   **Verdict on Problem Validity:** The problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and testable against the provided principles. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of a Solution from First Principles\n\nTo be a correct answer, an option must provide a set of goals and a monitoring plan that simultaneously satisfies all the given constraints:\n1.  **Goals must be SMART:** Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.\n2.  **Goals and interventions must align with the aims of supportive psychotherapy:** They should target stabilization, coping, affect regulation, problem-solving, and adaptive functioning.\n3.  **The monitoring plan must exemplify measurement-based care:** It must involve regular (e.g., weekly) use of objective, standardized scales (e.g., GAD-7, WAI-SR) and/or structured subjective ratings (e.g., SUDS, logs).\n4.  **The overall plan must reflect a collaborative, structured, and empathic stance:** This includes monitoring the therapeutic alliance and developing plans *with* the patient, not imposing unrealistic or punitive measures.\n\n### Step 4: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Goals & Monitoring:**\n-   **Goals Analysis:**\n    -   \"Reduce Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) score by $\\geq 5$ points within 4 weeks\": This is a classic SMART goal. It is Specific (GAD-7), Measurable ($\\geq 5$ points), Achievable (a 5-point drop is the threshold for a clinically significant response), Relevant (targets the core anxiety), and Time-bound (4 weeks). It aligns with the aim of relieving distress.\n    -   \"Increase adherence to a collaboratively written coping plan... to $\\geq 80\\%$ of workdays within 4 weeks\": This is a SMART goal targeting adaptive functioning and problem-solving.\n    -   \"Extend average delay between... urge to quit and... skill use from... 30 seconds to $\\geq 3$ minutes within 3 weeks\": This is a highly specific, measurable goal directly targeting affect regulation and frustration tolerance. It is achievable and time-bound.\n    -   \"Maintain session attendance at $>90\\%$... and reduce... reassurance texts... to $\\leq 7$ per day within 4 weeks\": These are SMART goals targeting the therapeutic alliance and adaptive functioning (reducing dependence).\n-   **Monitoring Analysis:** The plan includes weekly standardized scales (GAD-7), session-by-session subjective ratings (SUDS), behavioral logs, and regular alliance measurement (WAI-SR). This is a textbook example of comprehensive measurement-based care. The collaborative and structured nature is explicit.\n-   **Verdict:** This option perfectly aligns with all the principles enumerated in the problem statement. The goals are SMART, the aims are consistent with supportive psychotherapy, and the monitoring plan is a model of measurement-based care. **Correct.**\n\n**B. Goals & Monitoring:**\n-   **Goals Analysis:** The goals (\"Identify the unconscious childhood source,\" \"resolve transference,\" \"Eliminate all defense mechanisms\") are characteristic of psychoanalytic or psychodynamic psychotherapy, not supportive psychotherapy. Supportive psychotherapy aims to strengthen, not eliminate, adaptive defenses. The goals are also not specific or measurable in a practical sense (e.g., \"fully resolve transference\").\n-   **Monitoring Analysis:** The proposed monitoring (\"qualitative impressions,\" \"avoid symptom scales\") is the antithesis of measurement-based care. It is subjective, infrequent, and dismisses objective data.\n-   **Verdict:** This option describes a different therapeutic modality and explicitly rejects the required operational framework. **Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Goals & Monitoring:**\n-   **Goals Analysis:** The goals are not Achievable (from SMART). \"Complete elimination of anxiety (SUDS = 0) at all times within 2 weeks\" is a clinically impossible and unrealistic expectation. \"Complete daily 2-hour exposure exercises... regardless of distress\" is a misapplication of exposure therapy that violates the empathic and stabilizing principles of supportive psychotherapy.\n-   **Monitoring Analysis:** The monitoring plan (\"Single end-of-treatment assessment,\" \"no interim measures,\" \"discourage alliance check-ins\") directly contradicts the principles of measurement-based care and the importance of maintaining the therapeutic alliance.\n-   **Verdict:** The goals are unrealistic and the monitoring plan is therapeutically inappropriate and contrary to the problem's requirements. **Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Goals & Monitoring:**\n-   **Goals Analysis:** The goals (\"Restore full... functioning... by the next session,\" \"Completely eliminate frustration outbursts within 1 week\") are patently un-Achievable. The timescale is fantastical for a chronic condition.\n-   **Monitoring Analysis:** The monitoring plan is inadequate and destructive. \"Rely solely on partner report\" is not collaborative or reliable. \"Cancel sessions if symptoms worsen\" constitutes therapeutic abandonment and violates the core of a supportive alliance. Avoiding written plans contradicts the 'structured' element of the therapeutic frame.\n-   **Verdict:** The goals are impossible and the \"monitoring\" techniques are iatrogenic and unethical. **Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Goals & Monitoring:**\n-   **Goals Analysis:**\n    -   \"Improve average sleep duration from... 5 hours to 7 hours... within 2 weeks\": This is a SMART goal targeting a key physiological symptom of anxiety, aligning with relieving distress and bolstering functioning.\n    -   \"Reduce reassurance texting... to $\\leq 5$ per day within 3 weeks...\": This is a SMART behavioral goal that fosters adaptive functioning and affect regulation.\n    -   \"Demonstrate two instances per day of deliberate frustration tolerance...\": This is a specific, measurable skill-building goal that directly enhances affect regulation and frustration tolerance.\n    -   \"Use a brief reality-testing checklist...\": This is a SMART goal that improves problem-solving and adaptive coping.\n-   **Monitoring Analysis:** The plan is comprehensive and robust. It includes daily logs (sleep, texting, skills), session-by-session ratings (SUDS), weekly standardized scales (GAD-7), and frequent alliance checks (verbal check-ins and WAI-SR). This is an exemplary implementation of measurement-based care within a collaborative framework.\n-   **Verdict:** This option, like option A, provides an excellent set of SMART goals that flow directly from the aims of supportive psychotherapy. The monitoring plan is fully consistent with measurement-based care and a strong therapeutic alliance. **Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "4764058"}, {"introduction": "The therapeutic power of supportive psychotherapy often lies in the clinician's moment-to-moment interventions.

These defenses are noted to be currently adaptive (supporting function and emotion regulation) but also limiting (preventing contact with grief).\n*   **Required Therapeutic Approach:** The response must embody supportive psychotherapy principles.\n*   **Specific Criteria for the Response:**\n    1.  Respectfully acknowledge the adaptive function of the defense.\n    2.  Preserve the patient’s stability.\n    3.  Gently introduce a tolerable amount of affect.\n    4.  The approach must be graded and collaborative.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the established criteria for validity.\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** Yes. The problem is situated within the established medical field of psychiatry. The concepts presented—grief, defense mechanisms (intellectualization, rationalization), and supportive psychotherapy—are foundational and well-documented within clinical psychology and psychiatry. The patient's reference to mitochondrial aging is biologically plausible. The scenario is a clinically realistic representation of a patient's reaction to acute loss.\n*   **Well-Posed:** Yes. The problem provides a clear clinical scenario and a specific question. It asks to identify which of the given options *best* aligns with a defined set of therapeutic principles. This structure allows for a unique, correct answer to be determined through logical application of these principles.\n*   **Objective:** Yes. The patient's words are quoted directly, and the clinician's assessment is provided as a premise for the problem. The question itself is objective, requiring an evaluation of options against a defined standard, not a subjective opinion.\n\n**Flaw Checklist:**\n1.  **Scientific/Factual Unsoundness:** None. The premises are consistent with established psychiatric theory and clinical practice.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable/Irrelevant:** The problem is highly relevant to its stated topic and can be rigorously analyzed using the principles of supportive psychotherapy.\n3.  **Incomplete/Contradictory Setup:** None. The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information to answer the question.\n4.  **Unrealistic/Infeasible:** None. The clinical vignette is highly realistic.\n5.  **Ill-Posed/Poorly Structured:** None. The terminology is standard for the field, and the question is unambiguous.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound/Trivial:** No. The problem requires a nuanced understanding of therapeutic technique, specifically the balance between validation and gentle therapeutic intervention. It is not trivial.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability:** No. The principles of supportive psychotherapy and the relative efficacy of different interventions are subject to clinical research and are part of evidence-based practice.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-constructed, clinically relevant question that is scientifically grounded, objective, and well-posed. I will now proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core task is to identify the therapist's response that aligns with the principles of supportive psychotherapy in the context of acute grief. Supportive psychotherapy aims to strengthen the patient's coping mechanisms and restore emotional equilibrium, especially during a crisis. It contrasts with expressive or insight-oriented therapies that might challenge defenses to uncover unconscious material. The key principles to apply are: (1) validating the current, adaptive function of the patient's defenses (intellectualization), (2) preserving stability by not overwhelming the patient, and (3) gently and collaboratively titrating a small amount of affect into the session.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. “You are rationalizing to avoid pain. Unless you stop intellectualizing and face the grief directly, this therapy will not work.”**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This response is a direct, confrontational interpretation. It explicitly labels the patient's coping as \"rationalizing to avoid pain\" and issues an ultimatum. This directly challenges the defenses that are, as stated in the problem, currently supporting the patient's functioning. Such a confrontation is highly likely to increase anxiety, shame, and resistance, thereby destabilizing the patient and damaging the therapeutic alliance. It is the antithesis of a supportive and collaborative approach.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. “Put the spreadsheets away for now and let yourself really feel this—tell me everything about your father, and do not hold back the tears.”**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This response commands the patient to abandon their coping mechanism (\"Put the spreadsheets away\") and demands a full, unmitigated emotional experience (\"let yourself really feel this,\" \"do not hold back the tears\"). This technique, known as flooding, directly opposes the principle of introducing affect in a \"graded\" and \"tolerable\" way. For a patient in acute crisis who is relying heavily on intellectual defenses, this approach is likely to be overwhelming, leading to emotional dysregulation or a shutdown.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. “It sounds like making sense of the biology and keeping the logistics organized helps you stay steady during a painful time. As we talk, would it be okay to also check in with how this is affecting you right now—perhaps just noticing a small piece of what you feel in your body while we keep the facts close by?”**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This response is meticulously constructed to align with all the required principles.\n    1.  **Acknowledge Adaptive Function:** The phrase, \"It sounds like...helps you stay steady during a painful time,\" explicitly validates the patient's strategy and acknowledges its a-adaptive, stabilizing purpose.\n    2.  **Preserve Stability:** By validating the defenses and offering to \"keep the facts close by,\" the therapist assures the patient that their primary coping tool will not be taken away. This promotes safety and stability.\n    3.  **Gently Introduce Affect:** The intervention is gentle (\"check in\"), targeted at a manageable dose (\"a small piece\"), and aimed at somatic experience (\"what you feel in your body\"), which is often a less threatening entry point to emotion than direct labeling.\n    4.  **Graded and Collaborative:** The use of interrogative, permissive language (\"would it be okay to...\") and tentative suggestions (\"perhaps just noticing\") frames the intervention as a collaborative exploration, giving the patient full control to accept or decline.\n*   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**D. “Let us build a detailed task list for the funeral and estate and assign each item to a timeline. We can revisit feelings later once the plan is complete.”**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This response fully colludes with the patient's defenses. While it is supportive and preserves stability, it fails to perform the therapeutic work of introducing affect. By becoming a co-planner and explicitly deferring emotions (\"revisit feelings later\"), the therapist avoids the patient's grief entirely. This makes the therapy therapeutically inert, missing the crucial opportunity to help the patient begin to process their experience in a safe environment. It supports the defense but does not gently test its limits or foster greater emotional integration.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. “Your interest in mitochondria suggests an unconscious conflict tied to early developmental fixations; the spreadsheet likely symbolizes your mother, which is why grief is displaced.”**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This response is an example of psychoanalytic or psychodynamic interpretation. It makes vast, speculative leaps from the patient's manifest content (mitochondria, spreadsheets) to a supposed latent, unconscious meaning (developmental fixations, symbolic representations). This is entirely inappropriate for supportive psychotherapy, especially in an acute crisis. It does not validate the adaptive function of the defense but instead pathologizes it. It is likely to be confusing, alienating, and destabilizing for the patient.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4764054"}]}
