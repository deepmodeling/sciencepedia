The observed intake score is 18, and the observed post-treatment score is 10.

Using classical test theory as the fundamental base—specifically the decomposition of observed scores into true scores and error, the definition of reliability as the ratio of true-score variance to observed-score variance, and the assumption of independent measurement errors across occasions—derive the expression for the Reliable Change Index (RCI) as a standardized difference score that quantifies change relative to expected measurement error. Then, compute the RCI for this patient’s change from 18 to 10 and, using the conventional two-tailed criterion based on the standard normal distribution, indicate in your solution whether the observed change is greater than what would be expected from measurement error alone.

The RCI is a statistic used to determine if the change in a score from one point in time to another is statistically significant, or if it is likely to be due to measurement error alone. The derivation is rooted in the principles of Classical Test Theory (CTT).\n\nFirst, let us state the fundamental tenets of CTT as requested. Any observed score, $X$, is a composite of a true score, $T$, and a random error component, $E$.\n$$X = T + E$$\nThe errors, $E$, are assumed to have a mean of $0$ and be uncorrelated with true scores. From this, the variance of the observed scores, $\\sigma_X^2$, can be decomposed into the sum of the variance of the true scores, $\\sigma_T^2$, and the variance of the error scores, $\\sigma_E^2$, assuming the covariance between true score and error is zero.\n$$\\sigma_X^2 = \\sigma_T^2 + \\sigma_E^2$$\nThe reliability of a test, denoted by $r_{XX}$, is defined as the proportion of the observed score variance that is attributable to true score variance.\n$$r_{XX} = \\frac{\\sigma_T^2}{\\sigma_X^2}$$\n\nThe first step in deriving the RCI is to determine the Standard Error of Measurement (SEM), which is the standard deviation of the error scores, $\\sigma_E$. We can express the error variance, $\\sigma_E^2$, in terms of the observed score variance, $\\sigma_X^2$, and the reliability, $r_{XX}$.\nFrom the definition of reliability, we have $\\sigma_T^2 = r_{XX} \\sigma_X^2$. Substituting this into the variance decomposition equation:\n$$\\sigma_X^2 = r_{XX} \\sigma_X^2 + \\sigma_E^2$$\nSolving for the error variance, $\\sigma_E^2$:\n$$\\sigma_E^2 = \\sigma_X^2 - r_{XX} \\sigma_X^2 = \\sigma_X^2 (1 - r_{XX})$$\nThe Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) is the square root of the error variance:\n$$SEM = \\sigma_E = \\sqrt{\\sigma_X^2 (1 - r_{XX})} = \\sigma_X \\sqrt{1 - r_{XX}}$$\n\nThe RCI quantifies the change between two scores, an initial score $X_1$ and a later score $X_2$. The change or difference score is $D = X_2 - X_1$. To standardize this change, we must divide it by the standard error of this difference, denoted $S_{diff}$.\n$$RCI = \\frac{X_2 - X_1}{S_{diff}}$$\nThe standard error of the difference, $S_{diff}$, is derived from the errors associated with $X_1$ and $X_2$. Let $E_1$ and $E_2$ be the error components of $X_1$ and $X_2$, respectively. The error of the difference score is $E_2 - E_1$. CTT assumes that measurement errors on separate occasions are independent. Therefore, the variance of the error of the difference is the sum of their individual variances:\n$$Var(E_2 - E_1) = Var(E_2) + Var(E_1)$$\nThe variance of the error at any single measurement is, by definition, the squared SEM, i.e., $\\sigma_E^2 = SEM^2$. Assuming a constant SEM across both measurement occasions:\n$$Var(E_2 - E_1) = SEM^2 + SEM^2 = 2 \\cdot SEM^2$$\nThe standard error of the difference, $S_{diff}$, is the square root of this variance:\n$$S_{diff} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot SEM^2} = SEM \\sqrt{2}$$\nSubstituting the expression for SEM, we get:\n$$S_{diff} = \\left(\\sigma_X \\sqrt{1 - r_{XX}}\\right) \\sqrt{2} = \\sigma_X \\sqrt{2(1 - r_{XX})}$$\nFinally, we can write the complete expression for the RCI by substituting the formula for $S_{diff}$ into the RCI equation:\n$$RCI = \\frac{X_2 - X_1}{\\sigma_X \\sqrt{2(1 - r_{XX})}}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the Reliable Change Index.\n\nNow, we compute the RCI for the patient. The given values are:\nIntake score, $X_1 = 18$.\nPost-treatment score, $X_2 = 10$.\nPopulation standard deviation, $\\sigma_X = 5$.\nTest-retest reliability, $r = r_{XX} = 0.85$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the standard error of the difference, $S_{diff}$:\n$$S_{diff} = 5 \\sqrt{2(1 - 0.85)} = 5 \\sqrt{2(0.15)} = 5 \\sqrt{0.30}$$\nNow, we compute the RCI:\n$$RCI = \\frac{10 - 18}{5 \\sqrt{0.30}} = \\frac{-8}{5 \\sqrt{0.30}}$$\nTo obtain the numerical value:\n$$RCI \\approx \\frac{-8}{5 \\times 0.5477225575} \\approx \\frac{-8}{2.7386127875} \\approx -2.92116$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the RCI is $-2.921$.\n\nTo determine if this change is greater than what would be expected from measurement error, we compare the absolute value of the RCI to the critical value from the standard normal distribution. For a two-tailed test with a conventional significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$, the critical value is $z_{crit} = 1.96$. A change is considered reliable if $|RCI| > 1.96$.\nIn this case, $|RCI| = |-2.921| = 2.921$.\nSince $2.921 > 1.96$, the observed decrease in the patient's PHQ-$9$ score is statistically reliable. This means the change is unlikely to be merely a product of the measurement's inherent imprecision and likely reflects a genuine improvement in the patient's depressive symptoms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-2.921}$$", "id": "4701178"}, {"introduction": "Behavioral Activation (BA) is a powerful intervention for depression, founded on the principle that engaging in reinforcing activities can alleviate depressive symptoms.

Concretely, they assume the proportion of behavior allocated to an alternative equals that alternative’s share of the obtained reinforcement across alternatives when bias is absent and sensitivity is unity.

Assume no other constraints (for example, no satiation, no capacity limits, and stable schedules) and that context is stable enough for equilibrium allocation to be approximated by the matching relation described above.\n\nDefine the weekly behavior allocation shift as the change in the predicted proportion of total behavior time allocated to activity A, computed as the post-intervention proportion minus the baseline proportion.

The problem defines this relation as: \"the proportion of behavior allocated to an alternative equals that alternative’s share of the obtained reinforcement across alternatives\". Let $B_A$ and $B_B$ be the behavior (e.g., time) allocated to activities $A$ and $B$ respectively. Let $R_A$ and $R_B$ be the corresponding obtained rates of reinforcement. The proportion of behavior allocated to activity $A$, denoted $P_A$, is given by $\\frac{B_A}{B_A + B_B}$.
