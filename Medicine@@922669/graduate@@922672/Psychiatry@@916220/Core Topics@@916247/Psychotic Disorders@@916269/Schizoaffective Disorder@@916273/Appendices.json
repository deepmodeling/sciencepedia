[@problem_id:4755777]", "problem": "An uninterrupted $24$-month period of illness is observed and operationalized as $104$ consecutive weeks. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) defines schizoaffective disorder by the presence of a major mood episode concurrent with Criterion A of schizophrenia, the occurrence of delusions or hallucinations for at least $2$ weeks in the absence of a major mood episode, and that symptoms meeting criteria for a major mood episode are present for the majority of the total duration of the active and residual portions of the illness. Assume the following definitions hold: an active phase occurs when Criterion A for schizophrenia is met; a residual phase occurs when psychotic symptoms persist subthreshold after an active phase; a major depressive episode duration is at least $2$ weeks; and a manic episode duration is at least $1$ week.\n\nYou are provided the week-by-week segmentation of the $104$-week observation window into active and residual phases of psychosis and the concurrent presence of major mood episodes. All weeks listed below are part of either the active or residual portions; there are no interspersed symptom-free remission weeks.\n\n- Weeks $1$–$12$: active psychosis. Major manic episode present during weeks $1$–$8$; mood symptoms absent during weeks $9$–$12$.\n- Weeks $13$–$20$: residual phase.

Major depressive episode present during weeks $45$–$52$; mood symptoms absent during weeks $53$–$60$.\n- Weeks $61$–$68$: active psychosis.

Let this total duration be $T_{total} = 104$ weeks.\n- The entire $104$-week period consists of active and residual portions of an illness.\n- Diagnostic Criterion for Schizoaffective Disorder: Symptoms of a major mood episode are present for the majority of the total duration of the active and residual portions of the illness. \"Majority\" implies a proportion greater than $1/2$.\n- Task: Compute the proportion $R$ of the total active and residual time during which a major mood episode is present.\n- Symptom Timeline:\n    - Weeks $1$–$12$ (Active): Major manic episode present for weeks $1$–$8$.\n    - Weeks $13$–$20$ (Residual): Major depressive episode present for weeks $13$–$18$.\n    - Weeks $21$–$30$ (Active): Major depressive episode present for weeks $21$–$24$.\n    - Weeks $31$–$36$ (Residual): Mood symptoms absent.\n    - Weeks $37$–$44$ (Active): Major manic episode present for weeks $37$–$44$.\n    - Weeks $45$–$60$ (Residual): Major depressive episode present for weeks $45$–$52$.\n    - Weeks $61$–$68$ (Active): Mood symptoms absent.\n    - Weeks $69$–$80$ (Residual): Major manic episode present for weeks $69$–$72$.\n    - Weeks $81$–$92$ (Active): Major depressive episode present for weeks $81$–$92$.\n    - Weeks $93$–$104$ (Residual): Mood symptoms absent.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the required criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem uses terminology and criteria (e.g., active phase, residual phase, major mood episode, schizoaffective disorder) from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR), a standard reference in psychiatry. It operationalizes these criteria into a quantitative calculation. While this is a simplification of a complex clinical diagnosis, it is a valid formalization for the purpose of a mathematical problem. It does not violate scientific principles but rather applies them within a defined, hypothetical context.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (a complete timeline of symptoms over a fixed duration) and asks for a specific, calculable quantity ($R$). The definitions are explicit, leading to a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated with objective, quantitative data (weeks of symptoms) and asks for a numerical computation. It is free of subjective or opinion-based statements.\n- The problem is self-contained, with no missing or contradictory information. The sum of the durations of all specified periods ($12+8+10+6+8+16+8+12+12+12$) correctly equals $104$ weeks. The question is unambiguous.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a well-defined, self-contained quantitative problem grounded in operationalized clinical definitions. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to calculate the proportion $R$, which is the ratio of the total time a major mood episode is present to the total duration of the illness.\n\nLet $T_{mood}$ be the total number of weeks during which a major mood episode (manic or depressive) is present.\nLet $T_{total}$ be the total duration of the active and residual portions of the illness.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the total duration is given as $T_{total} = 104$ weeks.\n\nWe must now calculate $T_{mood}$ by summing the durations of all periods where a major mood episode was present. The duration of a period from week $a$ to week $b$ (inclusive) is calculated as $b - a + 1$.\n\n1.  Weeks $1$–$8$: A major manic episode is present.\n    Duration = $8 - 1 + 1 = 8$ weeks.\n2.  Weeks $13$–$18$: A major depressive episode is present.\n    Duration = $18 - 13 + 1 = 6$ weeks.\n3.  Weeks $21$–$24$: A major depressive episode is present.\n    Duration = $24 - 21 + 1 = 4$ weeks.\n4.  Weeks $31$–$36$: Mood symptoms are absent.\n    Duration = $0$ weeks.\n5.  Weeks $37$–$44$: A major manic episode is present.\n    Duration = $44 - 37 + 1 = 8$ weeks.\n6.  Weeks $45$–$52$: A major depressive episode is present.\n    Duration = $52 - 45 + 1 = 8$ weeks.\n7.  Weeks $61$–$68$: Mood symptoms are absent.\n    Duration = $0$ weeks.\n8.  Weeks $69$–$72$: A major manic episode is present.\n    Duration = $72 - 69 + 1 = 4$ weeks.\n9.  Weeks $81$–$92$: A major depressive episode is present.\n    Duration = $92 - 81 + 1 = 12$ weeks.\n10. Weeks $93$–$104$: Mood symptoms are absent.\n    Duration = $0$ weeks.\n\nNow, we sum these durations to find the total time with a major mood episode, $T_{mood}$:\n$$\nT_{mood} = 8 + 6 + 4 + 0 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 4 + 12 + 0\n$$\n$$\nT_{mood} = 50 \\text{ weeks}\n$$\n\nThe proportion $R$ is the ratio of $T_{mood}$ to $T_{total}$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{T_{mood}}{T_{total}} = \\frac{50}{104}\n$$\n\nTo express this proportion as a reduced fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and the denominator. Both $50$ and $104$ are even numbers, so they are divisible by $2$.\n$$\n50 = 2 \\times 25\n$$\n$$\n104 = 2 \\times 52\n$$\nSo, we can simplify the fraction:\n$$\nR = \\frac{2 \\times 25}{2 \\times 52} = \\frac{25}{52}\n$$\nThe prime factorization of the new numerator is $25 = 5^2$. The prime factorization of the new denominator is $52 = 2^2 \\times 13$.

All data, including the clinical scenario, drug, formulations, and pharmacokinetic parameters, are consistent with established medical and pharmacological science. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe first task is to select and justify the appropriate long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic. The patient is known to be clinically stable on oral extended-release paliperidone. The most rational and clinically sound strategy is to transition the patient to the LAI formulation of the same active medication, which is paliperidone palmitate. This approach minimizes the risk of treatment failure or the emergence of new adverse effects that could occur when switching to a different antipsychotic agent. Paliperidone palmitate is also approved for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder, making it the indicated choice.\n\nThe second task is to compute the maintenance dose of paliperidone palmitate for monthly administration.
