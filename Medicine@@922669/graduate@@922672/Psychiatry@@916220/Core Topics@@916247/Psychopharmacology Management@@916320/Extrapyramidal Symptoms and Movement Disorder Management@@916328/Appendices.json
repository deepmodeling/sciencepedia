We are given the drug's elimination half-life, $t_{1/2}$, and the target fraction, $\\alpha$.\n\nFirst, we must establish the mathematical model. The rate of change of the drug concentration, $C(t)$, in a single compartment is the difference between the rate of input and the rate of elimination.\nThe depot formulation is assumed to provide a constant input rate. Let's model this as a zero-order process, where the concentration increases at a constant rate, which we will denote as $k_0$.\nThe elimination is described as a first-order process, meaning the rate of elimination is proportional to the current concentration, $k C(t)$, where $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\nThe resulting differential equation governing the drug concentration $C(t)$ over time $t$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = k_0 - k C(t) $$\nThe patient is starting the medication, so the initial concentration is zero.
