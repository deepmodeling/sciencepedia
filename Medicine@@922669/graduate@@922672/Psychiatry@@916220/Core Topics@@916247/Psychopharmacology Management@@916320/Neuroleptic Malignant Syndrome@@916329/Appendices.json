Dopamine $\\mathrm{D}2$ receptor antagonism in the hypothalamus impairs thermoregulatory set-point control.\n    2. Dopamine blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway produces severe rigidity that increases metabolic heat production.\n    3. Sustained skeletal muscle contraction increases risk of rhabdomyolysis with renal injury via myoglobin release.\n- **Question:** Determine the most appropriate immediate management that addresses the primary pathophysiology and reduces morbidity.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is assessed for validity.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The presented clinical case is a textbook example of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a known, severe reaction to dopamine-blocking agents. The signs (hyperthermia, autonomic instability, rigidity, altered mental status), laboratory values (elevated CK, leukocytosis, acute kidney injury), and precipitating medication (haloperidol, a potent $\\mathrm{D}2$ antagonist) are all consistent with this diagnosis. The provided pathophysiological principles are accurate and fundamental to understanding NMS.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a detailed and coherent clinical scenario, including history, physical exam, and laboratory data, and asks for the best management step. The information is sufficient to arrive at a specific diagnosis and formulate a treatment plan based on established medical guidelines. A unique and correct course of action exists among the choices.\n- **Objective:** The description uses precise medical terminology and quantitative data. It is free from subjective or ambiguous language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The data are internally consistent. The high CK level corresponds to the \"lead-pipe\" rigidity and explains the myoglobinuria and subsequent acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine). The patient is on a high and recently escalated dose of a typical antipsychotic, providing a clear temporal and pharmacological cause. The mention of sertraline is relevant for the differential diagnosis of serotonin syndrome, but the clinical findings (especially lead-pipe rigidity and decreased reflexes) strongly favor NMS over serotonin syndrome (which typically involves hyperreflexia and clonus). The exclusion of anesthetic triggers correctly steers away from malignant hyperthermia. The problem is well-specified and non-contradictory.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It presents a scientifically accurate, well-posed, and objective clinical challenge. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe clinical picture is pathognomonic for Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a life-threatening idiosyncratic reaction to antipsychotic medications. The diagnosis is established by synthesizing the given information with the provided fundamental principles.\n\n1.  **Pathophysiological Synthesis:** The primary insult is the potent dopamine $\\mathrm{D}2$ receptor blockade caused by the high-dose haloperidol.\n    - As stated in Principle 1, $\\mathrm{D}2$ antagonism in the hypothalamus disrupts central thermoregulation, leading to the severe hyperthermia ($T = 40.3^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$).\n    - As per Principle 2, $\\mathrm{D}2$ blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway causes the characteristic severe, generalized \"lead-pipe\" rigidity. This intense, sustained muscle contraction is a major source of endogenous heat production, exacerbating the hyperthermia.\n    - Following Principle 3, the massive muscle rigidity leads to skeletal muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), evidenced by the extremely high creatine kinase (CK) level of $18{,}000$ U/L. The release of myoglobin from damaged muscle cells into the bloodstream and its subsequent filtration by the kidneys causes myoglobinuria (indicated by the positive \"blood\" on urinalysis with no red blood cells) and acute tubular necrosis, resulting in acute kidney injury (creatinine $2.2$ mg/dL).\n    - The autonomic instability (tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis) is also a consequence of central dopaminergic and autonomic dysregulation.\n\n2.  **Formulation of Management Strategy:** An effective management strategy must be immediate, comprehensive, and target both the underlying cause and the life-threatening complications.\n    - **Primary Intervention:** The immediate cessation of the offending agent, haloperidol, is the single most critical step.\n    - **Supportive Care:** This is a medical emergency requiring intensive care.\n        - **Aggressive Cooling:** The severe hyperthermia must be treated aggressively with external cooling measures (e.g., cooling blankets, ice packs to axillae and groin) to prevent central nervous system damage and reduce the hypermetabolic state.\n        - **Hemodynamic Support and Renal Protection:** Aggressive intravenous hydration with isotonic fluids (e.g., $0.9\\%$ normal saline) is crucial to correct dehydration (from diaphoresis and poor intake), support blood pressure, and, most importantly, maintain high urine output to flush myoglobin from the renal tubules and prevent further kidney damage.\n    - **Specific Pharmacotherapy:**\n        - **Reversal of Dopamine Blockade:** A dopamine agonist, such as bromocriptine, can be administered to counteract the central $\\mathrm{D}2$ blockade, directly addressing the root pathophysiological mechanism in the hypothalamus and basal ganglia.\n        - **Muscle Relaxation:** For severe rigidity and hypermetabolism, dantrolene, a direct-acting skeletal muscle relaxant that inhibits calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, is often used. It effectively reduces rigidity and heat production.\n    - **Level of Care:** Given the multi-system involvement (neurologic, renal, cardiovascular) and the need for intensive monitoring and interventions, the patient must be admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Discontinue haloperidol; initiate aggressive intravenous (IV) isotonic fluids and active external cooling; start bromocriptine; consider adding dantrolene if severe rigidity persists; admit to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).**\nThis option outlines the complete, standard-of-care management for severe NMS. It correctly identifies the need to (1) stop the causative agent, (2) provide aggressive supportive care (IV fluids, cooling), (3) administer specific pharmacological antidotes (bromocriptine and potentially dantrolene), and (4) place the patient in the appropriate high-acuity setting (ICU). Each component directly follows from the pathophysiological analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Administer cyproheptadine to reverse serotonin excess; continue haloperidol at a reduced dose; avoid dopamine agonists to prevent worsening psychosis.**\nThis option mistakes NMS for serotonin syndrome. Cyproheptadine is an antidote for serotonin syndrome, not NMS. The clinical signs of lead-pipe rigidity and decreased reflexes are characteristic of NMS, whereas serotonin syndrome typically presents with neuromuscular hyperactivity like clonus and hyperreflexia. Continuing the haloperidol, even at a reduced dose, would be catastrophic as it is the offending agent. Avoiding dopamine agonists ignores the primary treatment for NMS. This approach is based on a misdiagnosis and is dangerous.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Administer succinylcholine to rapidly reduce muscle activity and facilitate endotracheal intubation; provide inhaled anesthetics to promote heat loss.**\nThis approach is flawed and hazardous. Succinylcholine, a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker, is absolutely contraindicated in the setting of rhabdomyolysis because it can cause a massive efflux of potassium from damaged muscle cells, leading to life-threatening hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest. Furthermore, this management plan (succinylcholine and volatile anesthetics) is associated with the treatment of Malignant Hyperthermia (MH), a separate entity triggered by these specific agents, which the problem statement explicitly notes the patient has not received.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Administer high-dose acetaminophen and ibuprofen for antipyresis; observe on the psychiatric ward without medication changes; anticipate spontaneous resolution.**\nThis option represents gross mismanagement. The fever in NMS is due to central hypothalamic dysregulation and massive peripheral heat production, not an altered set-point that responds to conventional antipyretics like acetaminophen or NSAIDs. Observing on a psychiatric ward is inappropriate for a critically ill patient. Failing to stop the haloperidol and anticipating spontaneous resolution would lead to rapid deterioration and a high likelihood of mortality.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Diagnose malignant catatonia; give high-dose lorazepam and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) while continuing antipsychotics to prevent psychotic relapse.**\nWhile NMS and malignant catatonia have overlapping features, the clear precipitant here is the high-dose antipsychotic, making NMS the primary diagnosis. Although lorazepam and ECT can be effective treatments for NMS (particularly refractory cases), the critical flaw in this option is the instruction to *continue antipsychotics*. This would perpetuate the underlying pathophysiology and is strictly contraindicated. The primary directive in NMS management is to stop all dopamine-blocking agents.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4732475"}, {"introduction": "Once NMS is identified, quantifying its severity is essential for monitoring the patient's response to treatment and guiding ongoing clinical decisions.

NMS cardinal features are hyperthermia, generalized “lead-pipe” rigidity, and autonomic instability. They plan to combine measurements of rigidity and autonomic signs into a single composite score. From first principles in measurement, any composite that adds heterogeneous variables must address unit incommensurability and differential clinical impact. To formalize these issues, the team considers the following data from a single patient at two time points during an evolving episode:\n\n- Within-patient pre-episode baselines (mean and standard deviation over the prior week): temperature $36.8\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ with standard deviation $0.2\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$; heart rate $72\\,\\mathrm{beats/min}$ with standard deviation $6\\,\\mathrm{beats/min}$; systolic blood pressure variability $3\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ with standard deviation $1.5\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ (defined as the $60$-minute standard deviation).

Conclude that the composite is unchanged from hour $0$ to hour $12$.\n\nC. Equal-weight standardization: convert temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure variability at each time to within-patient $z$-scores using the patient’s baseline means and standard deviations; convert rigidity sum to a $z$-score using a reference distribution for the three-item SAS rigidity sum in antipsychotic-naïve psychiatric inpatients (assume reference mean $1.0$ and standard deviation $1.5$), treat diaphoresis as $0/1$, and add all components with equal weight. Conclude that the composite increases from hour $0$ to hour $12$.\n\nD. Clinically weighted standardization: same standardization as in option C, but assign higher weight to temperature and rigidity (core morbidity drivers) by doubling their contributions relative to heart rate and blood pressure variability; treat diaphoresis as $0/1$.

The features described (hyperthermia, rigidity, autonomic instability) and the measurements used are medically accurate. The data values are plausible for an evolving NMS episode.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data to evaluate each of the four proposed methods. The question is clear: determine which option most appropriately operationalizes measurement principles and correctly identifies the trend. It is well-posed.\n-   **Objective:** The problem statement is objective, relying on quantitative data and explicitly defined procedures for each option. The evaluation criteria (\"measurement principles\") are standard concepts in statistics and clinimetrics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed to derive the solution by analyzing each option.\n\nThe central challenge in constructing the composite score is to address two issues highlighted in the problem statement:\n1.  **Unit Incommensurability**: The variables are measured in different units ($^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, $\\mathrm{beats/min}$, $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, and ordinal scale points), making their direct addition scientifically meaningless.\n2.  **Differential Clinical Impact**: Not all signs contribute equally to the morbidity of NMS. A robust score should reflect the relative clinical importance of each component.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option against these principles.\n\n**Option A: Raw-unit addition**\n\nThis option proposes a composite score $S_A$ calculated as:\n$$S_A = R_{sum} + T + HR + SBPV + D$$\nwhere $D=1$ if diaphoresis is present and $D=0$ otherwise.\n\n-   **Calculations:**\n    -   At hour $0$: $S_{A,0} = 6 + 38.6 + 128 + 9 + 1 = 182.6$.\n    -   At hour $12$: $S_{A,12} = 9 + 39.4 + 116 + 14 + 1 = 179.4$.\n\n-   **Analysis:**\n    -   The calculation shows that $S_{A,12} < S_{A,0}$, so the conclusion that the composite decreases is arithmetically correct based on the proposed formula.\n    -   However, the method is fundamentally flawed. Adding values with different units is analogous to adding a distance in meters to a mass in kilograms; the resulting number has no physical or clinical interpretation. This method completely fails to address unit incommensurability. The score is dominated by heart rate due to the large numerical value of its measurements, which is an arbitrary artifact of the chosen units, not a reflection of clinical importance.\n\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The method is inappropriate from first principles of measurement, rendering its conclusion meaningless despite being arithmetically consistent with the flawed procedure.\n\n**Option B: Dichotomous threshold count**\n\nThis option proposes a score $S_B$ equal to the count of fulfilled criteria.\n\n-   **Calculations:**\n    The criteria are: $T \\geq 38.5\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, $HR \\geq 120\\,\\mathrm{beats/min}$, $SBPV \\geq 15\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, $R_{sum} \\geq 6$, Diaphoresis present.\n    -   **At hour $0$**:\n        1.  $T_0 = 38.6 \\geq 38.5$: Yes ($+1$)\n        2.  $HR_0 = 128 \\geq 120$: Yes ($+1$)\n        3.  $SBPV_0 = 9 < 15$: No ($+0$)\n        4.  $R_0 = 6 \\geq 6$: Yes ($+1$)\n        5.

The option's conclusion that the composite is \"unchanged\" is factually incorrect.\n    -   Methodologically, this approach discards significant quantitative information. For instance, it does not distinguish between a temperature of $38.5\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and a life-threatening $41.0\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. This loss of granularity makes the score insensitive to clinically significant changes, making it poorly suited for tracking severity over time.\n\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The method is methodologically poor for tracking severity, and its stated conclusion is contradicted by the results of its own procedure.\n\n**Option C: Equal-weight standardization**\n\nThis option proposes using $z$-scores to standardize the variables before summation. The score $S_C$ is:\n$$S_C = z_T + z_{HR} + z_{SBPV} + z_R + D$$\nThe $z$-score is calculated as $z = (x - \\mu) / \\sigma$.\n\n-   **Calculations:**\n    -   **At hour $0$**:\n        -   $z_{T,0} = (38.6 - 36.8) / 0.2 = 9.0$\n        -   $z_{HR,0} = (128 - 72) / 6 = 56 / 6 \\approx 9.33$\n        -   $z_{SBPV,0} = (9 - 3) / 1.5 = 4.0$\n        -   $z_{R,0} = (6 - 1.0) / 1.5 = 5.0 / 1.5 \\approx 3.33$\n        -   $S_{C,0} = 9.0 + 56/6 + 4.0 + 5.0/1.5 + 1 = 14 + 28/3 + 10/3 = 14 + 38/3 \\approx 26.67$.\n    -   **At hour $12$**:\n        -   $z_{T,12} = (39.4 - 36.8) / 0.2 = 13.0$\n        -   $z_{HR,12} = (116 - 72) / 6 = 44 / 6 \\approx 7.33$\n        -   $z_{SBPV,12} = (14 - 3) / 1.5 = 11 / 1.5 \\approx 7.33$\n        -   $z_{R,12} = (9 - 1.0) / 1.5 = 8.0 / 1.5 \\approx 5.33$\n        -   $S_{C,12} = 13.0 + 44/6 + 11/1.5 + 8.0/1.5 + 1 = 14 + 22/3 + 22/3 + 16/3 = 14 + 60/3 = 14 + 20 = 34.0$.\n\n-   **Analysis:**\n    -   The calculation shows that the score increases from $\\approx 26.67$ to $34.0$. The option's conclusion that the composite increases is correct.\n    -   This method correctly addresses unit incommensurability by converting all continuous measures to a common, dimensionless scale (standard deviation units). This is a standard and valid approach. However, it assumes equal clinical importance for each component by adding them with a weight of $1$, which may not be clinically optimal.\n\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct** in its general approach and conclusion, but potentially suboptimal. It is a valid method, but a better one may exist.\n\n**Option D: Clinically weighted standardization**\n\nThis option refines the method in C by assigning differential weights based on clinical importance. The score $S_D$ is:\n$$S_D = 2 \\cdot z_T + z_{HR} + z_{SBPV} + 2 \\cdot z_R + D$$\n\n-   **Calculations:**\n    Using the $z$-scores computed for option C:\n    -   **At hour $0$**:\n        -   $S_{D,0} = 2(9.0) + (56/6) + 4.0 + 2(5.0/1.5) + 1 = 18 + 28/3 + 4 + 20/3 + 1 = 23 + 48/3 = 23 + 16 = 39.0$.\n    -   **At hour $12$**:\n        -   $S_{D,12} = 2(13.0) + (44/6) + (11/1.5) + 2(8.0/1.5) + 1 = 26 + 22/3 + 22/3 + 32/3 + 1 = 27 + 76/3 \\approx 27 + 25.33 = 52.33$.\n\n-   **Analysis:**\n    -   The calculation shows that the score increases from $39.0$ to $\\approx 52.33$. The conclusion that the composite increases is correct.\n    -   This method represents the most sophisticated and appropriate approach among the choices. It correctly uses standardization to solve the unit problem, just as in Option C. Crucially, it goes a step further by explicitly addressing the second fundamental challenge: \"differential clinical impact.\" By assigning greater weight to hyperthermia and rigidity—the cardinal drivers of NMS morbidity—it creates a more clinically valid and sensitive index of severity. This directly implements the principles outlined in the problem setup. The worsening clinical picture (higher temperature and rigidity) is more pronounced in this score than in the unweighted score of Option C, reflecting its enhanced clinical validity.\n\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option employes the most appropriate methodology and yields a correct conclusion. It is superior to Option C because it addresses both unit incommensurability and differential clinical impact.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options, Option D provides the most methodologically sound and clinically relevant approach. It correctly applies standardization to resolve unit incommensurability and incorporates differential weighting to reflect the clinical importance of the component variables, precisely addressing the two key measurement challenges posed in the problem statement. Its conclusion regarding the direction of change is also supported by the calculations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "4732464"}, {"introduction": "The successful treatment of NMS often requires specific pharmacological interventions, and their efficacy depends on precise dosing tailored to the individual patient.

Assume a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order elimination for dantrolene over the first day of treatment, and the following well-tested properties: elimination half-life $t_{1/2}$ is defined by the relationship $k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$, and a rapid intravenous bolus produces an instantaneous concentration increment $\\Delta C = \\frac{D}{V_d}$, where $D$ is the dose and $V_d$ is the volume of distribution. Superposition applies: concentrations from separate boluses add linearly.\n\nA patient weighing $85\\ \\mathrm{kg}$ is treated with dantrolene as follows: an initial loading dose of $2.5\\ \\mathrm{mg/kg}$ at time $t=0$, followed by equal maintenance doses every $6\\ \\mathrm{h}$ at times $t=6\\ \\mathrm{h}$, $t=12\\ \\mathrm{h}$, and $t=18\\ \\mathrm{h}$. The clinical team aims to maintain the plasma dantrolene concentration at or above a therapeutic threshold $C_{\\mathrm{th}} = 2.4\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$ immediately prior to each maintenance dose in the first $24\\ \\mathrm{h}$.\n\nAssume the elimination half-life is $t_{1/2} = 8\\ \\mathrm{h}$ over this period, and the volume of distribution scales with body mass as $V_d = 0.6\\ \\mathrm{L/kg} \\times W$, where $W$ is body weight. Using only the definitions above and first principles of first-order elimination, determine the minimal maintenance dose per administration, $d_m$ (in $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$), that ensures the concentration just prior to $t=6\\ \\mathrm{h}$, $t=12\\ \\mathrm{h}$, and $t=18\\ \\mathrm{h}$ is at least $C_{\\mathrm{th}}$. Then, compute the total mass of dantrolene administered between $t=0$ and $t=18\\ \\mathrm{h}$ inclusive (four doses) for this patient, expressed in $\\mathrm{mg}$. Round your final total mass to three significant figures and express it in $\\mathrm{mg}$.", "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Step 1: Extracted Givens**\n- Model: One-compartment pharmacokinetic model, first-order elimination.\n- Elimination rate constant: $k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$.\n- Concentration increment: $\\Delta C = \\frac{D}{V_d}$ for a rapid intravenous bolus dose $D$.\n- Superposition: Concentrations from separate boluses add linearly.\n- Patient weight: $W = 85\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n- Dosing schedule:\n    - Initial loading dose $d_l = 2.5\\ \\mathrm{mg/kg}$ at $t=0\\ \\mathrm{h}$.\n    - Equal maintenance doses, $d_m$, at $t=6\\ \\mathrm{h}$, $t=12\\ \\mathrm{h}$, and $t=18\\ \\mathrm{h}$.\n- Therapeutic objective: Plasma concentration $\\ge C_{\\mathrm{th}} = 2.4\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$ immediately prior to each maintenance dose.\n- Elimination half-life: $t_{1/2} = 8\\ \\mathrm{h}$.\n- Volume of distribution: $V_d = 0.6\\ \\mathrm{L/kg} \\times W$.\n- Task: Determine the minimal maintenance dose per administration ($d_m$) and then compute the total mass of dantrolene administered from $t=0$ to $t=18\\ \\mathrm{h}$ inclusive, rounded to three significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validation**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem uses a standard one-compartment model with first-order elimination, a cornerstone of clinical pharmacokinetics. The values for dantrolene's half-life and volume of distribution are realistic. The clinical scenario is appropriate.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary parameters ($W$, $t_{1/2}$, $V_d$ scaling, $d_l$, dosing intervals, $C_{\\mathrm{th}}$) are provided to determine a unique solution for the requested quantities.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe concentration $C(t)$ of a drug following a single intravenous bolus dose that yields an initial concentration $C_0$ is described by the first-order elimination model:\n$$C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt)$$\nThe elimination rate constant, $k$, is related to the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, by:\n$$k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{8\\ \\mathrm{h}}$$\nThe patient-specific volume of distribution, $V_d$, is:\n$$V_d = (0.6\\ \\mathrm{L/kg}) \\times W = (0.6\\ \\mathrm{L/kg}) \\times (85\\ \\mathrm{kg}) = 51\\ \\mathrm{L}$$\nThe loading dose mass, $D_l$, is:\n$$D_l = d_l \\times W = (2.5\\ \\mathrm{mg/kg}) \\times (85\\ \\mathrm{kg}) = 212.5\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe initial concentration after the loading dose at $t=0$ is:\n$$C(0^+) = \\frac{D_l}{V_d} = \\frac{212.5\\ \\mathrm{mg}}{51\\ \\mathrm{L}}$$\nThe maintenance dose mass, $D_m$, is related to the dose per unit weight by $D_m = d_m \\times W$.\n\nUsing the principle of superposition, we can write the trough concentration just before each maintenance dose. The dosing interval is $\\Delta t = 6\\ \\mathrm{h}$.\n\n1.  Concentration at $t=6\\ \\mathrm{h}$ (before the first maintenance dose): This is the concentration remaining from the loading dose.\n    $$C(6^-) = \\frac{D_l}{V_d} \\exp(-k \\Delta t)$$\n\n2.  Concentration at $t=12\\ \\mathrm{h}$ (before the second maintenance dose): This is the sum of the remaining concentrations from the loading dose and the first maintenance dose.\n    $$C(12^-) = \\frac{D_l}{V_d} \\exp(-2k \\Delta t) + \\frac{D_m}{V_d} \\exp(-k \\Delta t)$$\n\n3.  Concentration at $t=18\\ \\mathrm{h}$ (before the third maintenance dose):\n    $$C(18^-) = \\frac{D_l}{V_d} \\exp(-3k \\Delta t) + \\frac{D_m}{V_d} \\exp(-2k \\Delta t) + \\frac{D_m}{V_d} \\exp(-k \\Delta t)$$\n\nThe clinical requirement is that each of these trough concentrations be at least $C_{\\mathrm{th}} = 2.4\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$. We must find the minimal $D_m$ that satisfies this for all three time points.\n\nLet's evaluate the decay factor for one dosing interval:\n$$\\exp(-k \\Delta t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{8\\ \\mathrm{h}} \\times 6\\ \\mathrm{h}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3 \\ln(2)}{4}\\right) = 2^{-3/4}$$\nFirst, we check the condition at $t=6\\ \\mathrm{h}$, which depends only on the loading dose:\n$$C(6^-) = \\frac{212.5\\ \\mathrm{mg}}{51\\ \\mathrm{L}} \\times 2^{-3/4} \\approx (4.1667\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}) \\times 0.5946 \\approx 2.478\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$$\nSince $C(6^-) \\approx 2.478\\ \\mathrm{mg/L} > C_{\\mathrm{th}} = 2.4\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$, this condition is met by the loading dose alone and places no lower-bound constraint on $D_m$.\n\nNext, we establish the constraints on $D_m$ from the other two time points.\nFor $t=12\\ \\mathrm{h}$:\n$$C(12^-) = \\frac{D_l}{V_d} \\exp(-2k \\Delta t) + \\frac{D_m}{V_d} \\exp(-k \\Delta t) \\ge C_{\\mathrm{th}}$$\n$$D_m \\ge \\frac{V_d C_{\\mathrm{th}} - D_l \\exp(-2k \\Delta t)}{\\exp(-k \\Delta t)}$$\nFor $t=18\\ \\mathrm{h}$:\n$$C(18^-) = \\frac{D_l}{V_d} \\exp(-3k \\Delta t) + \\frac{D_m}{V_d} (\\exp(-2k \\Delta t) + \\exp(-k \\Delta t)) \\ge C_{\\mathrm{th}}$$\n$$D_m \\ge \\frac{V_d C_{\\mathrm{th}} - D_l \\exp(-3k \\Delta t)}{\\exp(-2k \\Delta t) + \\exp(-k \\Delta t)}$$\nThe minimal required $D_m$ is the maximum of the lower bounds derived from these two inequalities. As time progresses, the contribution from the large initial loading dose diminishes, suggesting that later time points will impose a stricter requirement on the maintenance dose. Thus, we expect the condition at $t=18\\ \\mathrm{h}$ to be the limiting one. The minimal maintenance dose $D_m$ is therefore found by setting $C(18^-) = C_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n$$D_m = \\frac{V_d C_{\\mathrm{th}} - D_l \\exp(-3k \\Delta t)}{\\exp(-2k \\Delta t) + \\exp(-k \\Delta t)}$$\nLet's substitute the exponential terms with powers of $2$:\n- $\\exp(-k \\Delta t) = 2^{-3/4}$\n- $\\exp(-2k \\Delta t) = (2^{-3/4})^2 = 2^{-3/2}$\n- $\\exp(-3k \\Delta t) = (2^{-3/4})^3 = 2^{-9/4}$\n$$D_m = \\frac{V_d C_{\\mathrm{th}} - D_l (2^{-9/4})}{2^{-3/2} + 2^{-3/4}}$$\nNow, we substitute the specified numerical values:\n- $V_d C_{\\mathrm{th}} = (51\\ \\mathrm{L}) \\times (2.4\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}) = 122.4\\ \\mathrm{mg}$\n- $D_l = 212.5\\ \\mathrm{mg}$\n- $2^{-3/4} \\approx 0.59460356$\n- $2^{-3/2} \\approx 0.35355339$\n- $2^{-9/4} \\approx 0.21022379$\n\nPlugging these into the expression for $D_m$:\n$$D_m = \\frac{122.4\\ \\mathrm{mg} - (212.5\\ \\mathrm{mg}) \\times (0.21022379)}{0.35355339 + 0.59460356} = \\frac{122.4\\ \\mathrm{mg} - 44.6728\\ \\mathrm{mg}}{0.94815695} = \\frac{77.7272\\ \\mathrm{mg}}{0.94815695} \\approx 81.977\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe problem requires the total mass of dantrolene administered between $t=0$ and $t=18\\ \\mathrm{h}$ inclusive. This regimen consists of one loading dose and three maintenance doses.\n$$M_{\\mathrm{total}} = D_l + 3 \\times D_m$$\n$$M_{\\mathrm{total}} = 212.5\\ \\mathrm{mg} + 3 \\times (81.977\\ \\mathrm{mg})$$\n$$M_{\\mathrm{total}} = 212.5\\ \\mathrm{mg} + 245.931\\ \\mathrm{mg} = 458.431\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\nRounding the final total mass to three significant figures gives $458\\ \\mathrm{mg}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{458}$$", "id": "4732470"}]}
