In the pathogenesis framework, bacterial biofilm drives inflammation that is amplified by smoking-related vasoconstriction and immune modulation and by legacy susceptibility marked by periodontitis history. For decision-support on management, the team fit a multivariate risk model grounded in the canonical logistic link used for binary outcomes, where the log-odds is a linear predictor of exposures. The model parameters are: baseline intercept $\\beta_{0}=-4.0$, coefficient for smoking $\\beta_{\\text{smoke}}=0.8$ (indicator equals $1$ if currently smoking, otherwise $0$), coefficient for periodontitis history $\\beta_{\\text{perio}}=1.2$ (indicator equals $1$ if documented history present, otherwise $0$), and coefficient for plaque index $\\beta_{\\text{plaque}}=0.05$ per one percentage point of plaque index measured as the percentage of examined implant-surrounding surfaces with visible plaque.\n\nConsider a patient currently smoking ($x_{\\text{smoke}}=1$), with documented periodontitis history ($x_{\\text{perio}}=1$), and a baseline plaque index of $24$ percentage points ($x_{\\text{plaque}}=24$).

All necessary parameters for the geometric calculation are provided, and the assumptions are explicitly stated.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the volume of bone loss for a peri-implant defect. The problem specifies that the defect should be modeled as a coaxial annular cylindrical shell. The volume $V$ of such a prism-like solid is given by the product of its base area $A_{base}$ and its height $h$.\n\n$V = A_{base} \\times h$\n\nThe height $h$ of the cylindrical shell corresponds to the vertical depth of the bone defect, which is given as $h = 4$ millimeters.\n\nThe base of the shell is an annulus (a ring-shaped region). The area of an annulus is the difference between the area of the outer circle and the area of the inner circle. Let $r_{out}$ be the radius of the outer circle and $r_{in}$ be the radius of the inner circle.

A bone loss volume of approximately $63$ mm$^3$ is substantial and generally precludes successful management with non-surgical anti-infective therapy alone, as complete detoxification of the deep, complex implant surface is not feasible without surgical access. The defect is described as a \"contained circumferential crater-type,\" which implies the presence of multiple surrounding bony walls (e.g., a $3$- or $4$-wall defect). This containment is highly favorable for a regenerative surgical approach, such as Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR). The bony walls provide a scaffold to hold bone graft material, creating a stable environment for new bone to form and regenerate the lost tissue. In contrast, resective surgery, which aims to eliminate the defect by removing bone, would be highly destructive for a deep, circumferential defect and is typically reserved for non-contained defects where regeneration is less predictable. Therefore, the combination of a large yet contained defect strongly indicates that a surgical regenerative procedure is the evidence-based treatment of choice to restore function, structure, and long-term implant stability.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{62.83}$$", "id": "4746624"}]}
