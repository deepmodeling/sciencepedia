It uses a standard engineering and physics practice of simplifying a complex system (a threaded dental implant) into an idealized model (a smooth cylinder) to analyze its properties based on first principles of geometry and mechanics. The principles cited—area of a cylinder and friction being proportional to normal force—are fundamental and correctly stated.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant:** The problem is formalizable into mathematical and physical terms. It is directly relevant to the core concepts of primary stability in implant dentistry (stomatology), which is a key factor for successful osseointegration.\n3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The problem is self-contained and consistent. For the qualitative part, it provides the necessary principles. For the quantitative part, it provides all required numerical values ($L$, $D_1$, $D_2$) for the calculation. The mention of \"axial taper\" in the qualitative task does not contradict the use of a non-tapered cylinder in the quantitative task; the former is a general consideration, while the latter is a specific calculation.\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The specified dimensions for the implant ($L=10 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$, $D \\approx 4 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$) are clinically realistic.

It requires the correct application of fundamental principles to a specific biomedical scenario, testing conceptual understanding rather than rote memorization of empirical formulas.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability:** The problem is fully verifiable through standard mathematical calculation and application of established physical principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem is addressed in two parts: a qualitative analysis of geometric parameters on primary stability and a quantitative calculation of a change in surface area.\n\n**Part 1: Qualitative Analysis from First Principles**\n\nThe lateral surface area, $A$, of an idealized cylindrical implant of diameter $D$ and length $L$ is given by the formula for the lateral surface of a right circular cylinder:\n$$A = \\pi D L$$\nPrimary stability, in this model, arises from frictional resistance, $F_f$. The fundamental model for static friction states that the maximum frictional force is proportional to the total normal force, $N$, pressing the surfaces together: $F_f = \\mu N$, where $\\mu$ is the coefficient of static friction. The problem states that the contact pressure, $p$, is uniform. The total normal force is the pressure integrated over the contact area, which for uniform pressure is $N = p A$. Therefore, the primary stability (frictional resistance) can be expressed as:\n$$F_f = \\mu (p A) = \\mu p (\\pi D L)$$\nThis shows that primary stability is directly proportional to the lateral contact area $A$ for a given material interface (constant $\\mu$) and press-fit (constant $p$). We can now analyze the effect of each geometric parameter.\n\n1.  **Effect of Implant Diameter ($D$):**\n    - **Lateral Contact Area:** From the expression $A = \\pi D L$, for a fixed length $L$, the lateral area $A$ is directly proportional to the diameter $D$. Thus, increasing the diameter increases the lateral contact area.\n    - **Primary Stability:** Since primary stability ($F_f$) is proportional to the area $A$, increasing the diameter $D$ leads to a proportional increase in the contact area, which in turn provides a larger surface for the generation of frictional forces. Consequently, primary stability increases. The mechanism is the direct increase in the total surface area over which the normal force acts.\n\n2.  **Effect of Implant Length ($L$):**\n    - **Lateral Contact Area:** From the expression $A = \\pi D L$, for a fixed diameter $D$, the lateral area $A$ is directly proportional to the length $L$. Thus, increasing the length increases the lateral contact area.\n    - **Primary Stability:** As with diameter, since primary stability ($F_f$) is proportional to area $A$, increasing the length $L$ increases the contact area and therefore proportionally increases the frictional resistance. The mechanism is the same: a larger area for frictional engagement.\n\n3.  **Effect of Axial Taper:**\n    - A tapered implant is geometrically a frustum of a cone. Its lateral surface area is given by $A_{\\text{taper}} = \\pi \\left(\\frac{D_{\\text{major}} + D_{\\text{minor}}}{2}\\right)s$, where $D_{\\text{major}}$ and $D_{\\text{minor}}$ are the major (coronal) and minor (apical) diameters, and $s$ is the slant height. For small taper angles, $s \\approx L$. The area is proportional to the *average* diameter. For a given maximal diameter $D_{\\text{major}}$ and length $L$, introducing a taper (i.e., having $D_{\\text{minor}}  D_{\\text{major}}$) will always result in a smaller lateral surface area compared to a straight cylinder of diameter $D_{\\text{major}}$.\n    - **Primary Stability:** The effect on stability is more complex. While a taper may reduce the total surface area compared to a straight cylinder of the same maximum diameter, it introduces a \"wedge effect\". During insertion with a press-fit, the tapered geometry actively generates compressive radial forces in the surrounding bone. This can significantly increase the effective normal force $N$, and thus the contact pressure $p$, compared to a simple interference fit of a straight cylinder. This increase in normal force can often be the dominant factor, leading to a net increase in primary stability ($F_f = \\mu N$) despite the smaller contact area $A$. Hence, an axial taper primarily enhances stability by mechanically generating higher compressive stress and normal forces through wedging, which increases frictional resistance.\n\n**Part 2: Quantitative Calculation**\n\nThe task is to compute the change in lateral contact surface area, $\\Delta A$, when the diameter of a cylindrical implant is changed, while its length is held constant.\n\nThe initial lateral surface area, $A_1$, with diameter $D_1$ and length $L$ is:\n$$A_1 = \\pi D_1 L$$\nThe final lateral surface area, $A_2$, with the new diameter $D_2$ and the same length $L$ is:\n$$A_2 = \\pi D_2 L$$\nThe change in area, $\\Delta A$, is the difference between the final and initial areas:\n$$\\Delta A = A_2 - A_1$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $A_1$ and $A_2$:\n$$\\Delta A = \\pi D_2 L - \\pi D_1 L$$\nFactoring out the common terms $\\pi$ and $L$:\n$$\\Delta A = \\pi L (D_2 - D_1)$$\nThe given values are:\n- $L = 10 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n- $D_1 = 3.5 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n- $D_2 = 4.5 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $\\Delta A$:\n$$\\Delta A = \\pi (10 \\ \\mathrm{mm}) (4.5 \\ \\mathrm{mm} - 3.5 \\ \\mathrm{mm})$$\n$$\\Delta A = \\pi (10 \\ \\mathrm{mm}) (1.0 \\ \\mathrm{mm})$$\n$$\\Delta A = 10\\pi \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2$$\nTo obtain the numerical value, we use the value of $\\pi \\approx 3.14159265...$.\n$$\\Delta A \\approx 10 \\times 3.14159265... \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2$$\n$$\\Delta A \\approx 31.4159265... \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $3$, $1$, $4$, and $1$. The fifth digit is $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\\Delta A \\approx 31.42 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2$$\nThis is the computed change in the lateral contact surface area.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{31.42}$$", "id": "4760906"}, {"introduction": "Once an implant is placed, it exists in a dynamic mechanical environment where occlusal forces are transmitted to the bone-implant interface.

This relationship, often referred to as Hooke's Law, states that the force, $F$, required to produce a certain displacement, $\\delta$, is directly proportional to that displacement. The constant of proportionality is the stiffness, $k$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$F = k \\delta$$\nHere, the stiffness $k$ is the slope of the force-displacement relation, as described in the problem.\n\nThe problem states that the implant is subjected to a harmonic axial load with amplitude $F_{0}$ and angular frequency $\\omega$. A full dynamic analysis would involve the equation of motion $m\\ddot{\\delta} + c\\dot{\\delta} + k\\delta = F(t)$, where $m$ is the effective mass and $c$ is the damping coefficient of the system. However, a critical condition is provided: the system operates under quasi-static conditions, which implies that the excitation frequency $\\omega$ is significantly lower than the first resonant frequency of the implant-bone system. This allows for a major simplification. In the quasi-static limit, the inertial effects (represented by the $m\\ddot{\\delta}$ term) and damping effects (the $c\\dot{\\delta}$ term) are negligible compared to the elastic restoring force from the stiffness (the $k\\delta$ term). The equation of motion thus reduces to a simple algebraic relationship at any given instant in time:\n$$k \\delta(t) \\approx F(t)$$\nThis means that the displacement of the implant tracks the applied force directly and instantaneously. The peak displacement, which is the micromotion amplitude $\\delta_{amp}$, will therefore occur at the moment the force reaches its peak value, $F_{0}$. This leads to the static relationship:\n$$F_{0} = k \\delta_{amp}$$\nTo find the micromotion amplitude, we rearrange this equation:\n$$\\delta_{amp} = \\frac{F_{0}}{k}$$\nThe problem provides the necessary values:\nPeak chewing load amplitude: $F_{0} = 100 \\ \\mathrm{N}$.\nInterfacial stiffness: $k = 800 \\ \\mathrm{N/mm}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation yields:\n$$\\delta_{amp} = \\frac{100 \\ \\mathrm{N}}{800 \\ \\mathrm{N/mm}} = \\frac{1}{8} \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\nEvaluating this fraction gives:\n$$\\delta_{amp} = 0.125 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be in units of micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$).

The \"stability dip,\" the concept of a critical micromotion threshold ($u_{\\mathrm{crit}}$) for osseointegration, and the principles of mechanobiology (Wolff's Law, Frost's Mechanostat) are all textbook knowledge in this field.

Based on these, a logical and unique prediction of the outcome is possible.\n- **Objective:** The language is clinical, precise, and objective. It avoids subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws. It is scientifically sound, internally consistent, complete, and directly addressable using the provided principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution will be derived by applying the given principles to the specified conditions.\n\n### Derivation of the Predicted Outcome\n\nThe problem requires predicting the outcomes for the Test implant relative to the Control implant. The Control implant, being protected from significant load, represents the baseline for undisturbed healing. It is expected to undergo successful osseointegration, with a progressive increase in Bone-Implant Contact (BIC) and stable marginal bone levels.\n\nThe key to the problem lies in the consequences of the events occurring in the Test implant between weeks $2$ and $4$.\n\n1.  **Effect on Bone-Implant Contact (BIC):**\n    The problem explicitly states that for the Test implant, the micromotion $u$ intermittently exceeds the critical threshold $u_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. According to Principle 2, when micromotion is above $u_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the healing response is skewed away from bone formation and towards the formation of a fibrous tissue layer at the bone-implant interface. This fibrous encapsulation is the antithesis of osseointegration, which is defined as direct bone-to-implant contact. Therefore, the formation of this fibrous tissue layer will directly and significantly reduce the percentage of BIC. This is not a transient phenomenon that can self-correct within a few weeks; the establishment of a fibrous interface represents a long-term healing trajectory, often classified as clinical failure. Thus, the BIC of the Test implant at week $12$ is expected to be persistently and significantly lower than that of the successfully integrating Control implant.\n\n2.  **Effect on Marginal Bone Levels:**\n    The problem states that the Test implant is subjected to functional occlusal loads while its interfacial stability is compromised (the \"stability dip\" phase, further exacerbated by the micromotion issue). Principle 3 highlights two relevant consequences:\n    (a) Stress concentrations at the crestal region can precipitate marginal bone loss when stability is compromised.\n    (b) Sustained strains in the supraphysiologic range lead to resorption.\n    Functional loading on a posterior implant generates high stress, which is known to concentrate in the crestal bone region. When the interface is not rigid (i.e., stability is low, and a fibrous layer may be forming), the load is not effectively transferred and distributed. This leads to pathological, supraphysiologic strains in the surrounding crestal bone. According to the stated mechanobiologic principles, this pathological strain is a powerful signal for bone resorption. Therefore, the Test implant is expected to experience a greater degree of crestal (marginal) bone loss compared to the unloaded Control implant. This bone loss is a direct consequence of the biomechanical insult during the critical healing period.\n\n**Conclusion:** The combination of early functional loading on a mechanically unstable implant, causing micromotion to exceed the critical threshold, is predicted to result in both the failure to achieve osseointegration (leading to persistently low BIC) and the initiation of pathological bone resorption at the implant crest (leading to greater marginal bone loss).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The Test implant exhibits a transient reduction in BIC during weeks $2$ to $4$ but fully recovers to match the Control implant’s BIC by week $12$, and marginal bone levels are equivalent between groups because bone formation eventually compensates for early disturbances.**\n- **Analysis:** This option is incorrect. The formation of a fibrous tissue layer resulting from micromotion exceeding $u_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ is a significant biological event that is not typically \"transient\" or fully recoverable within this timeframe. It represents a different healing pathway. The claim of equivalent marginal bone levels also contradicts Principle 3, which predicts resorption under conditions of instability and overload.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. The Test implant demonstrates a persistently lower BIC at week $12$ compared to the Control implant, with greater crestal (marginal) bone loss over the first $12$ weeks due to stress concentrations and fibrous interposition resulting from micromotion above $u_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ during weeks $2$ to $4$.**\n- **Analysis:** This option perfectly aligns with the derivation above. Exceeding $u_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ leads to fibrous interposition, causing a \"persistently lower BIC.\" Loading an unstable interface leads to stress concentration and supraphysiologic strain at the crest, causing \"greater crestal (marginal) bone loss.\" The reasoning provided in the option is precisely the mechanism described by the problem's principles.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. The Test implant shows increased BIC in weeks $2$ to $4$ due to mechanotransduction and has reduced marginal bone loss by week $12$ compared to the Control implant, because early functional loading stimulates woven bone deposition at the interface.**\n- **Analysis:** This describes the ideal outcome of successful early loading, where micromotion is kept *below* the critical threshold and provides an anabolic (bone-forming) stimulus. However, the problem explicitly states the opposite condition: micromotion *exceeds* the critical threshold ($u  u_{\\mathrm{crit}}$). This places the bone in a catabolic (resorptive) strain environment, leading to fibrous tissue and bone loss, not enhanced bone formation.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. The Test implant has no meaningful change in BIC relative to the Control implant by week $12$, but develops bone loss predominantly at the mid-body and apex rather than crestally, because early loading redistributes stress away from the crestal region.**\n- **Analysis:** This option is incorrect for two main reasons. First, the premise of \"no meaningful change in BIC\" is a direct contradiction to the stated consequence of exceeding $u_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. Second, the claim that loading redistributes stress *away* from the crest is biomechanically false for typical implant designs under occlusal load; stress is characteristically concentrated at the crest. Therefore, any overload-induced bone loss would be expected to initiate at the crest, not predominantly at the mid-body or apex.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4760912"}]}
