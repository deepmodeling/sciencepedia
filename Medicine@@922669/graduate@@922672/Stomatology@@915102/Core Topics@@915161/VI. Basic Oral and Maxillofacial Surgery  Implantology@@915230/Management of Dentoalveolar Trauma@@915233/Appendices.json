This is a problem of dimensional analysis, grounded in the fundamental principles of pharmacology.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the information provided:\n- The mass of the child, $m_{child} = 20\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- The maximum safe dose of lidocaine per unit body mass, $D_{max,specific} = 4\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$.\n- The concentration of the lidocaine solution is given as $2\\%$. We must first formalize this concentration, $C$, in units of mass per unit volume. A $2\\%$ solution, by mass per volume convention in pharmacology, signifies $2$ grams of solute per $100$ milliliters of solvent. We convert grams to milligrams:\n$$C = \\frac{2\\,\\mathrm{g}}{100\\,\\mathrm{mL}} = \\frac{2 \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{100\\,\\mathrm{mL}} = \\frac{2000\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{100\\,\\mathrm{mL}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$$\nThis matches the value provided in the problem statement, which confirms the consistency of the givens.\n\nThe first objective is to determine the maximum total mass of lidocaine, denoted as $M_{max,total}$, that can be safely administered. This is calculated by multiplying the child's mass by the specific maximum safe dose.\n\n$$M_{max,total} = m_{child} \\times D_{max,specific}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n$$M_{max,total} = 20\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 4\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg}}$$\n\nThe unit of kilograms ($\\mathrm{kg}$) cancels, yielding the result in milligrams ($\\mathrm{mg}$):\n$$M_{max,total} = 80\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThe second objective is to determine the maximum total volume of the $2\\%$ lidocaine solution, denoted as $V_{max,total}$, that corresponds to this maximum mass of lidocaine. The relationship between mass of a solute ($M$), its concentration in a solution ($C$), and the volume of the solution ($V$) is given by:\n$$C = \\frac{M}{V}$$\n\nTo find the volume, we can rearrange this formula:\n$$V = \\frac{M}{C}$$\n\nIn this specific case, we are calculating the maximum volume corresponding to the maximum safe mass:\n$$V_{max,total} = \\frac{M_{max,total}}{C}$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated maximum mass and the given concentration:\n$$V_{max,total} = \\frac{80\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{20\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}}$$\n\nThe unit of milligrams ($\\mathrm{mg}$) cancels, yielding the result in milliliters ($\\mathrm{mL}$):\n$$V_{max,total} = 4\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThus, the maximum total mass of lidocaine that can be safely administered is $80\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, and this mass is contained within a volume of $4\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of the $2\\%$ solution.

To rationalize periodontal ligament (PDL) cell survival for decision-making in replantation and root surface handling, assume first-order cell death kinetics: the instantaneous rate of loss of viable fraction $P(t)$ is proportional to the current fraction, with proportionality constant (rate constant) $k$ measured in $\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.

This involves gentle handling, rinsing the root with a biocompatible isotonic solution (e.g., Hank's Balanced Salt Solution, saline, or milk) to remove debris without damaging the cells, and immediate replantation. Scraping the root or using cytotoxic chemicals would be strongly contraindicated as it would destroy the remaining viable cells needed for regeneration.\n-   If PDL cell viability is zero or near-zero (i.e., the PDL is necrotic), the clinical goal shifts. The necrotic tissue itself becomes a nidus for inflammation and root resorption upon replantation. The strategy is then to **remove** the necrotic tissue (e.g., by mechanical scraping) and treat the root surface (e.g., with fluoride) to make it more resistant to osteoclasts, accepting that the likely outcome is ankylosis (bony fusion of the root to the socket), which is preferable to losing the tooth from inflammatory resorption.\n\nA viable fraction of $P(30) \\approx 0.2231$ is low, indicating that a significant majority of the cells ($~77.69\\%$) are non-viable. However, it is a non-negligible fraction. The presence of any substantial number of viable cells offers a chance for true periodontal regeneration. Therefore, the resulting probability strongly dictates that clinical management should prioritize **preservation of the residual PDL**. The appropriate action is to gently rinse the root and replant immediately, in the hope of maximizing the regenerative potential of the surviving cell population, even if the overall prognosis is guarded due to the extensive cell loss.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2231}$$", "id": "4730015"}, {"introduction": "Diagnosing pulp vitality after trauma is fraught with uncertainty, and initial assessments must be updated as new clinical data emerges.
