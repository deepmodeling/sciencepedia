[@problem_id:4740954]", "problem": "An odontogenic periapical infection originating from a mandibular molar typically dissects along the path of least resistance through bone and enters the adjacent fascial space bounded by muscular attachments and fascial planes. The mylohyoid muscle originates from the mylohyoid line on the lingual aspect of the mandible and forms the principal barrier separating the sublingual space (above the mylohyoid) from the submandibular space (below the mylohyoid). Consider a sagittal schematic in which the mylohyoid line is depicted as sloping superiorly in the posterior direction. Assume the infection exits the lingual cortical plate near the level of the root apex. Use the following fundamental bases to reason which space is favored by pus from each tooth: (i) the path-of-least-resistance principle, (ii) the barrier function of the mylohyoid muscle, and (iii) the relative position of root apices to the mylohyoid attachment.\n\nLet the anteroposterior coordinate along the mandibular body be denoted by $x$, with $x$ increasing posteriorly. Let $h(x)$ represent the vertical height of the mylohyoid attachment from a fixed mandibular reference plane, with $h(x)$ increasing monotonically as $x$ increases (i.e., the attachment is higher posteriorly). Let $a_{1}$ be the vertical position of the lingual perforation point for the mandibular $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ molar at $x=x_{1}$, and let $a_{3}$ be the corresponding position for the mandibular $3^{\\mathrm{rd}}$ molar at $x=x_{3}$, with $x_{3}>x_{1}$. If $a_{i}>h(x_{i})$, pus exits above the mylohyoid attachment and favors the sublingual space; if $a_{i}<h(x_{i})$, pus exits below the mylohyoid attachment and favors the submandibular space.\n\nWhich option best describes the favored fascial space involvement for the mandibular $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ molar versus the mandibular $3^{\\mathrm{rd}}$ molar under these anatomical conditions?\n\nA. Mandibular $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ molar favors sublingual involvement; mandibular $3^{\\mathrm{rd}}$ molar favors submandibular involvement.\n\nB. Mandibular $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ molar favors submandibular involvement; mandibular $3^{\\mathrm{rd}}$ molar favors sublingual involvement.\n\nC. Both mandibular $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ and $3^{\\mathrm{rd}}$ molars favor sublingual involvement because the posteriorly higher mylohyoid increases the superior route for pus in all posterior regions.\n\nD. Both mandibular $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ and $3^{\\mathrm{rd}}$ molars favor submandibular involvement due to posterior slope directing pus inferiorly.\n\nE. The sagittal schematic does not permit any favored prediction; space involvement is indeterminate without cross-sectional imaging.", "solution": "The solution requires integrating the formal model provided in the problem with established anatomical facts about the mandible.
