Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) measurement in the planned osteotomy trajectory shows the vertical linear distance from the alveolar crest to the superior border of the mandibular canal (carrying the inferior alveolar nerve) is $14$ millimeters. For prosthetic-driven implant positioning, the surgical plan maintains an apical safety margin from the canal of $2$ millimeters to mitigate neurosensory injury risk, and a coronal countersink of $1$ millimeter to achieve platform positioning and crest management consistent with soft tissue stability.

The concepts described—alveolar crest height, mandibular canal, inferior alveolar nerve, surgical safety margins, and implant countersinking—are fundamental and accurately represented. The numerical values provided ($14$ mm bone height, $2$ mm safety margin, $1$ mm countersink) are clinically realistic.

It represents a a straightforward application of geometric principles to a clinical scenario. Therefore, a reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem requires the determination of the maximum permissible length of a dental implant based on anatomical and surgical constraints. We can model the situation as a one-dimensional linear problem, as justified by the problem statement.\n\nLet $D_{total}$ represent the total available vertical bone height, measured from the alveolar crest to the superior border of the mandibular canal.\nFrom the givens, $D_{total} = 14$ mm.\n\nThis total vertical dimension, $D_{total}$, must accommodate three distinct segments arranged sequentially along the axis of the implant:\n$1$. The vertical distance from the alveolar crest to the implant platform. The problem specifies a \"coronal countersink of $1$ millimeter to achieve platform positioning\". In surgical terms, this means the implant platform is placed $1$ millimeter apical to (below) the alveolar crest. Let this distance be $C_{coronal} = 1$ mm.\n$2$. The length of the implant body itself, from its platform to its apex. Let this be $L_{implant}$. We seek to find its maximum safe value, $L_{implant,max}$.\n$3$. The required apical safety margin, which is the buffer zone of bone between the implant's apex and the mandibular canal, necessary to prevent nerve injury. Let this distance be $S_{apical} = 2$ mm.\n\nSince these three lengths are collinear and contiguous, they must sum to the total available vertical distance. The governing equation is therefore:\n$$D_{total} = C_{coronal} + L_{implant} + S_{apical}$$\n\nTo find the maximum safe implant length, $L_{implant,max}$, we must use the full extent of the available space while respecting the defined constraints. We can solve the equation for $L_{implant}$:\n$$L_{implant} = D_{total} - C_{coronal} - S_{apical}$$\n\nThe maximum implant length corresponds to the case where the equality holds. Substituting the given numerical values:\n$$L_{implant,max} = 14 - 1 - 2$$\n\nPerforming the subtraction:\n$$L_{implant,max} = 11$$\n\nThus, the maximum safe implant body length that can be used without violating the specified apical safety margin is $11$ millimeters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11}$$", "id": "4727136"}, {"introduction": "The long-term stability of an implant restoration depends on sound biomechanical principles, particularly at the implant-abutment interface. This practice problem delves into the critical concept of preload, the clamping force that holds the prosthetic components together. By applying the fundamental engineering relationship between torque, friction, and preload, you will calculate the stability of the connection and learn why achieving adequate preload is essential for preventing the common clinical complication of screw loosening [@problem_id:4727146].", "problem": "A single implant-supported molar crown is restored on a titanium abutment secured by a threaded screw.

Using fundamental principles of threaded fastener mechanics and accepted implant biomechanics, calculate the abutment screw preload from the given torque, and then interpret whether the computed preload is adequate to maintain joint stability under the stated posterior single-unit loading. Express the preload in Newtons and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of mechanical engineering (threaded fastener mechanics) and its application to biomechanics (implant prosthodontics), is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, formal language.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the preload in an abutment screw and an assessment of its adequacy for maintaining joint stability. The relationship between the applied insertion torque ($T$), the resulting preload or clamping force ($F_p$), the nominal fastener diameter ($d$), and the friction characteristics of the joint is described by the short-form torque-preload equation:\n$$T = K F_p d$$\nwhere $K$ is the dimensionless nut factor, which consolidates the effects of thread friction and friction at the bearing surface under the screw head.\n\nFirst, we must rearrange this equation to solve for the preload, $F_p$:\n$$F_p = \\frac{T}{K d}$$\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Insertion torque, $T = 35\\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{cm}$\n- Nut factor, $K = 0.20$\n- Nominal thread diameter, $d = 2.0\\,\\text{mm}$\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency in the calculation, we must express the length units of torque and diameter in the same base. We will convert the torque from Newton-centimeters ($\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{cm}$) to Newton-millimeters ($\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{mm}$). Knowing that $1\\,\\text{cm} = 10\\,\\text{mm}$:\n$$T = 35\\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{cm} = 35\\,\\text{N} \\times (10\\,\\text{mm}) = 350\\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{mm}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the rearranged equation to calculate the preload $F_p$:\n$$F_p = \\frac{350\\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{mm}}{0.20 \\times 2.0\\,\\text{mm}}$$\nThe denominator simplifies to:\n$$K \\times d = 0.20 \\times 2.0\\,\\text{mm} = 0.40\\,\\text{mm}$$\nThus, the preload is:\n$$F_p = \\frac{350\\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{mm}}{0.40\\,\\text{mm}} = 875\\,\\text{N}$$\nThe result, $875\\,\\text{N}$, is already expressed with three significant figures as requested.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires an interpretation of whether this preload is adequate. Joint stability in a bolted connection, such as an implant-abutment interface, is maintained as long as the clamping force (preload) is greater than the external separating force. An opening of the joint, which can lead to micromotion, screw loosening, and eventual component failure, is prevented if the following condition is met:\n$$F_p  F_{\\text{load}}$$\nThe problem states that the peak instantaneous axial occlusal load, $F_{\\text{load}}$, is $300\\,\\text{N}$. We can now compare the calculated preload to this external load:\n$$875\\,\\text{N}  300\\,\\text{N}$$\nThe condition for joint stability is satisfied. The preload of $875\\,\\text{N}$ generated by the recommended torque is nearly three times greater than the peak functional load of $300\\,\\text{N}$. This provides a significant safety factor, ensuring that the abutment-implant joint remains securely clamped and stable during function, which is critical for the long-term biomechanical integrity and clinical success of the implant restoration. Therefore, the computed preload is adequate.\nThe final numerical answer required is the value of the preload.\n$$F_p = 875\\,\\text{N}$$\nThis can be expressed in standard scientific notation as $8.75 \\times 10^2\\,\\text{N}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{8.75 \\times 10^{2}}\n$$", "id": "4727146"}, {"introduction": "Once an implant is restored, vigilant long-term maintenance is key to its survival.

The clinical details are sufficient and consistent for a rigorous analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived based on the provided data.\n\n### Analysis and Derivation\n\nThe primary task is to classify the patient's peri-implant condition and determine the most appropriate initial therapy. This requires applying the accepted definitions for peri-implant health and diseases.\n\n**1. Classification of the Peri-Implant Condition:**\n\nAccording to the 2017 World Workshop Classification, the key diagnostic criteria are:\n- **Peri-implant Health:** Absence of inflammation (no BOP) and no evidence of progressive bone loss beyond initial healing/remodeling.\n- **Peri-implant Mucositis:** Presence of inflammation (BOP) without progressive bone loss beyond initial healing/remodeling.\n- **Peri-implantitis:** Presence of inflammation (BOP), typically increased probing depths compared to baseline, and radiographic evidence of bone loss beyond initial healing/remodeling.\n\nLet's apply these criteria to the case:\n- **Bleeding on Probing (BOP):** The patient has BOP at $2$ of $6$ sites. This finding confirms the presence of inflammation and rules out peri-implant health.\n- **Probing Depth (PD):** The PDs have increased from a baseline of $3$–$4$ millimeters to $5$–$6$ millimeters. This indicates a deepening of the peri-implant sulcus/pocket.\n- **Radiographic Bone Loss (RBL):** The patient exhibits an additional $1.2$ millimeters of crestal bone loss over the $12$-month follow-up period. This is a clear sign of progressive bone destruction beyond any initial, self-limiting physiologic remodeling that might have occurred in the first year.\n\nThe combination of BOP, increased PD, and documented progressive RBL definitively meets the diagnostic criteria for **peri-implantitis**. The other potential diagnoses are inconsistent with the findings: it cannot be peri-implant mucositis due to the RBL, and it cannot be physiologic remodeling due to the progressive nature of the bone loss accompanied by active inflammation (BOP and increased PD).\n\n**2. Selection of Initial Therapy:**\n\nThe diagnosis of peri-implantitis necessitates active therapeutic intervention to arrest disease progression. The standard of care begins with non-surgical therapy. The goals are to eliminate the inflammatory lesion and decontaminate the implant surface.\n\nKey considerations for this specific case:\n- **Cement-retained crown with subgingival margins:** This is a major risk factor. It is extremely difficult to perform adequate subgingival debridement with the crown in place. Furthermore, excess subgingival cement is a well-documented primary etiological factor for peri-implantitis.\n- **PD of $5$–$6$ mm:** These pocket depths make biofilm removal by conventional non-surgical means challenging.\n\nTherefore, an effective non-surgical protocol must include:\n- **Access:** Removal of the cement-retained crown is essential to gain direct access to the implant surface for thorough cleaning and to inspect for and remove any residual cement.\n- **Decontamination:** A combination of methods is typically employed, such as titanium or plastic curettes, and importantly, air-abrasive devices using low-abrasion powders (e.g., glycine, erythritol) which are shown to be effective and safe for cleaning implant surfaces.\n- **Etiological Factor Control:** Any identified excess cement must be removed. The contours of the prosthesis should be evaluated and modified if necessary to ensure it is cleansable for the patient.\n- **Re-evaluation:** After an appropriate healing interval (typically $6$–$8$ weeks), the site must be re-evaluated to assess the response to therapy (reduction in PD and BOP).\n- **Contingency Planning:** If non-surgical therapy fails to resolve the deep pockets and inflammation, surgical therapy is the next step.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Peri-implant mucositis; deliver professional supragingival plaque control and reinforce patient oral hygiene only; defer further imaging and no alteration to the prosthesis is needed.**\n- The diagnosis of peri-implant mucositis is incorrect. The patient has progressive radiographic bone loss, a hallmark of peri-implantitis.\n- The proposed therapy is for mucositis and is grossly inadequate for peri-implantitis. It fails to address the subgingival bacterial load on the implant surface within the $5$–$6$ millimeter pockets.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Physiologic crestal remodeling; observe with routine maintenance at $12$-month intervals without active intervention.**\n- The diagnosis of physiologic remodeling is incorrect. Physiologic remodeling is a self-limiting process establishing a biologic width and is not associated with concurrent inflammation (BOP) and progressive pocketing. The loss of $1.2$ mm of bone in one year with inflammation is pathological.\n- The recommendation to \"observe\" active disease is contrary to all established treatment principles, which mandate intervention to arrest progression.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Peri-implantitis; initiate non-surgical therapy including removal of the crown for access, thorough implant surface decontamination using appropriate instruments and air-abrasive glycine/erythritol powder, irrigation with antiseptic, elimination of any residual cement and prosthesis contour modifications to facilitate hygiene, risk factor control, and re-evaluation in $6$–$8$ weeks, with consideration of surgical therapy if residual PD $\\geq 5$–$6$ millimeters with BOP.**\n- The diagnosis of peri-implantitis is correct.\n- The proposed therapy is comprehensive and aligns perfectly with the current evidence-based, standard-of-care protocol for the initial non-surgical management of peri-implantitis, especially in the context of a cement-retained restoration. It correctly prioritizes access by crown removal, thorough decontamination, management of etiological factors, and includes the critical steps of re-evaluation and contingency for surgical therapy.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**D. Peri-implantitis; perform immediate implant removal and plan a two-stage re-implantation following site grafting.**\n- The diagnosis of peri-implantitis is correct.\n- The proposed therapy is excessively aggressive. Explantation is a treatment of last resort for hopeless implants with advanced bone loss (often defined as $50\\%$ bone loss or mobility) or those that have failed to respond to other therapies. The bone loss described ($1.2$ mm) is in the early-to-moderate stage, and the implant is a candidate for salvage therapy.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Occlusal overload–related bone loss; perform selective occlusal adjustment only and monitor soft tissue inflammation resolution over $3$ months.**\n- The diagnosis is not supported by the evidence. The problem states that the occlusion is favorable (\"light centric contacts and no excursive interferences\"). While occlusal factors can contribute to bone loss, the primary signs in this case (BOP, pocket deepening) point strongly to a plaque-induced inflammatory lesion.\n- The therapy is insufficient as it ignores the infectious component of the disease. While occlusal assessment is always important, solely adjusting the occlusion would not resolve the inflammation caused by the subgingival biofilm.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4727129"}]}
