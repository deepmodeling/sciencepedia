Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) measurements show site-dependent differences in cortical plate thickness and cancellous density. You plan a single implant of outer diameter $d$ (measured in mm). Use the concept of a peri-implant hard-tissue envelope, defined as the minimal circumferential hard tissue thickness around the implant required to preserve vascular supply, minimize crestal remodeling, and maintain long-term volume stability.\n\nAssume the following foundational facts and definitions:\n- The alveolar ridge width $W$ (measured crestally at the planned platform level) can be decomposed as $$W = d + t_b + t_l,$$ where $t_b$ and $t_l$ are the buccal and lingual hard-tissue thicknesses, respectively.\n- A peri-implant hard-tissue envelope of thickness $e$ is satisfied if and only if $$t_b \\geq e \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t_l \\geq e.$$ Minimizing hard-tissue requirements subject to maintaining the envelope means choosing $$t_b = e \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t_l = e.$$\n- In the anterior maxilla (thin facial plate, higher esthetic demand, greater susceptibility to recession), clinical stability is widely achieved when the envelope thickness is at least $e_a = 2$ mm.\n- In the posterior mandible (thicker cortical plates, denser bone, lower esthetic demand), long-term stability has been widely reported with a reduced envelope $e_p = 1.5$ mm, provided occlusal loads and emergence profiles are controlled.\n\nStarting only from these facts and definitions, derive the minimum required buccal and lingual hard-tissue thicknesses $t_b$ and $t_l$ for each site (anterior maxilla and posterior mandible).

The concepts of alveolar ridge width, implant diameter, and required buccal/lingual bone thickness are fundamental to diagnosis and treatment planning. The specific values provided, such as a minimum of $2$ mm of facial bone in the esthetic zone (anterior maxilla), are consistent with widely accepted clinical guidelines aimed at preventing gingival recession and esthetic complications. The model $W = d + t_b + t_l$ is a correct and standard geometric simplification.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary definitions and values to determine the requested quantities. The term \"minimum required\" thickness is explicitly defined as the case where the inequalities become equalities. This leads to a unique and stable solution directly from the givens.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language. The clinical justifications provided for the different envelope thicknesses ($e_a$ and $e_p$) serve as context but do not introduce subjectivity into the calculation itself.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. There is no missing information required for the derivation, nor are there any contradictory statements.\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem is not trivial in a way that invalidates it; rather, it is a straightforward application of provided definitions, testing logical deduction from a set of axioms. It is not pseudo-profound, ill-posed, or unrealistic.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. A solution can be derived directly from the provided definitions and facts.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to find the minimum required buccal thickness, $t_b$, and lingual thickness, $t_l$, for two distinct anatomical sites: the anterior maxilla and the posterior mandible.\n\nThe problem states that a peri-implant hard-tissue envelope of thickness $e$ is maintained if $t_b \\geq e$ and $t_l \\geq e$. It further defines that the minimum hard-tissue requirement is met when these inequalities become equalities. Therefore, the minimum required thicknesses for any site are given by:\n$$t_b = e$$\n$$t_l = e$$\n\nWe apply this rule to each specified site.\n\n**1. Anterior Maxilla**\n\nFor the anterior maxilla, the problem specifies a required envelope thickness of $e_a = 2$ mm.\nUsing the rule for minimum required thickness, we set $e = e_a$.\nThe minimum required buccal thickness is:\n$$t_b = e_a = 2 \\text{ mm}$$\nThe minimum required lingual thickness is:\n$$t_l = e_a = 2 \\text{ mm}$$\n\n**2. Posterior Mandible**\n\nFor the posterior mandible, the problem specifies a required envelope thickness of $e_p = 1.5$ mm.\nUsing the rule for minimum required thickness, we set $e = e_p$.\nThe minimum required buccal thickness is:\n$$t_b = e_p = 1.5 \\text{ mm}$$\nThe minimum required lingual thickness is:\n$$t_l = e_p = 1.5 \\text{ mm}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be a single row listing, in order: anterior maxilla $t_b$, anterior maxilla $t_l$, posterior mandible $t_b$, and posterior mandible $t_l$.\nBased on the derivations, these values are $2$ mm, $2$ mm, $1.5$ mm, and $1.5$ mm, respectively.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2  2  1.5  1.5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4712436"}, {"introduction": "A successful treatment plan must account not only for the biological foundation but also for the biomechanical forces the restoration will generate.

The problem is a formalizable engineering calculation and does not contain any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Bending Moment**\nThe implant-cantilever system is modeled as a cantilever beam. The fixed support is located at the crestal cortical ring, which must provide a reaction moment to maintain static equilibrium. A vertical force $F$ is applied at a distance $l$ from this support.\n\nBy the principles of statics, the sum of moments about any point must be zero for an object in equilibrium. We consider the moments about the buccal-lingual axis passing through the centroid of the cortical ring cross-section. The externally applied force $F$ creates a moment $M_{ext} = F \\cdot l$. The support at the cortical bone provides an internal reaction moment, $M$, that counteracts this external moment.\n$$ \\sum M_{support} = 0 $$\n$$ M - F \\cdot l = 0 $$\nThus, the magnitude of the bending moment at the fixed support is:\n$$ M = F \\cdot l $$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Maximum Normal Stress**\nThe maximum normal stress, $\\sigma_{max}$, due to bending is given by the flexure formula from Euler-Bernoulli beam theory:\n$$ \\sigma_{max} = \\frac{M \\cdot c}{I} $$\nwhere $M$ is the bending moment, $c$ is the perpendicular distance from the neutral axis to the outermost fiber of the cross-section, and $I$ is the second moment of area (area moment of inertia) of the cross-section about the neutral axis.\n\nFirst, we determine the geometric properties of the hollow circular cross-section of the cortical bone.\nThe inner radius $r$ is half the implant diameter:\n$$ r = \\frac{d_{implant}}{2} = \\frac{4.50\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{2} = 2.25\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nThe outer radius $R$ is the inner radius plus the cortical thickness $t$:\n$$ R = r + t = 2.25\\,\\mathrm{mm} + 2.00\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 4.25\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nFor a symmetric cross-section like a hollow circle, the neutral axis passes through the centroid. The maximum stress occurs at the outermost fiber, so the distance $c$ is equal to the outer radius $R$:\n$$ c = R = 4.25\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the second moment of area, $I$, for a hollow circular section about a centroidal axis. The formula is:\n$$ I = \\frac{\\pi}{4} (R^4 - r^4) $$\nSubstituting the values for $R$ and $r$:\n$$ I = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\left( (4.25\\,\\mathrm{mm})^4 - (2.25\\,\\mathrm{mm})^4 \\right) $$\n$$ I = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\left( 326.25390625\\,\\mathrm{mm}^4 - 25.62890625\\,\\mathrm{mm}^4 \\right) $$\n$$ I = \\frac{\\pi}{4} (300.625\\,\\mathrm{mm}^4) \\approx 236.1154\\,\\mathrm{mm}^4 $$\n\nNow, we calculate the bending moment, $M$:\n$$ M = F \\cdot l = (250\\,\\mathrm{N}) \\cdot (8.00\\,\\mathrm{mm}) = 2000\\,\\mathrm{N \\cdot mm} $$\n\nFinally, we substitute all values into the flexure formula to find the maximum normal stress $\\sigma_{max}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{max} = \\frac{M \\cdot c}{I} = \\frac{(2000\\,\\mathrm{N \\cdot mm}) \\cdot (4.25\\,\\mathrm{mm})}{236.1154\\,\\mathrm{mm}^4} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{max} = \\frac{8500\\,\\mathrm{N \\cdot mm^2}}{236.1154\\,\\mathrm{mm}^4} \\approx 36.0003\\,\\mathrm{N/mm^2} $$\nThe unit of stress is Newtons per square millimeter ($\\mathrm{N/mm^2}$).
