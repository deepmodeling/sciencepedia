The negative sign indicates that for a positive moment (causing the beam to bend concave up), the stress is compressive ($\\sigma  0$) for $y  0$ and tensile ($\\sigma  0$) for $y  0$. We are interested in the magnitude of the maximum stress.\n\nThe maximum normal bending stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{max}}$, occurs at the outermost fibers of the beam, where the distance from the neutral axis is maximized. For a solid circular cross-section of diameter $d$, the neutral axis passes through the center, and the maximum distance to the outer fiber is $c$:\n$$\nc = y_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{d}{2}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the maximum stress is therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{M c}{I}\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified by introducing the section modulus, $S$, which is defined as $S = I/c$. The formula for maximum bending stress then becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{M}{S}\n$$\nTo solve the problem, we must first determine the bending moment $M$ and the section modulus $S$ for the implant neck.\n\nThe implant is modeled as a cantilever, and the occlusal force $F$ is applied at a horizontal lever arm $L$. This force creates a bending moment $M$ at the implant neck. The maximum bending moment in a cantilever beam subjected to a point load at its free end occurs at the fixed support. In this model, this corresponds to the implant-bone interface. The magnitude of this moment is the product of the force and the lever arm:\n$$\nM = F \\cdot L\n$$\nNext, we determine the section modulus $S$ for the solid circular cross-section. The area moment of inertia, $I$, for a circular cross-section of diameter $d$ about a diametral axis is:\n$$\nI = \\frac{\\pi d^4}{64}\n$$\nUsing the definition of the section modulus $S = I/c$ with $c = d/2$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{I}{c} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi d^4}{64}}{\\frac{d}{2}} = \\frac{\\pi d^4}{64} \\cdot \\frac{2}{d} = \\frac{\\pi d^3}{32}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for $M$ and $S$ back into the formula for $\\sigma_{\\text{max}}$ to derive the final symbolic relationship:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{M}{S} = \\frac{F \\cdot L}{\\frac{\\pi d^3}{32}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{32 F L}{\\pi d^3}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the maximum normal bending stress at the outer fiber of the implant neck.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the given data.

This means that a small increase in implant diameter leads to a substantial reduction in bending stress. For example, doubling the diameter would decrease the stress by a factor of $2^3 = 8$. Increasing the implant diameter is therefore a very effective strategy to reduce the risk of mechanical failure (e.g., fatigue fracture) of the implant components and to lower the stress transferred to the surrounding bone, which can help prevent bone resorption (osteolysis) due to mechanical overload.\n- **Effect of lever arm ($L$)**: The stress $\\sigma_{\\text{max}}$ is directly proportional to the lever arm $L$. Reducing the lever arm, for instance by shaping the crown to move the occlusal contact point closer to the implant's central axis, results in a proportional decrease in stress.
