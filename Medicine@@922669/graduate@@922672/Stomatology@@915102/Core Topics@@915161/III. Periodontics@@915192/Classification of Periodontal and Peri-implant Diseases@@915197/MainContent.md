## Introduction
The diagnosis and management of periodontal and peri-implant diseases were fundamentally transformed by the 2017 World Workshop classification system. This evidence-based framework represents a paradigm shift, moving away from outdated labels like 'chronic' and 'aggressive' periodontitis towards a more precise, multidimensional approach. This new system addresses the limitations of previous classifications by providing a standardized method to assess not only disease severity but also management complexity and a patient's future risk of progression. This article will guide you through this modern classification, beginning with its core concepts. In the first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, we will dissect the diagnostic criteria for health, gingivitis, and periodontitis, and detail the staging and grading system. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, will illustrate the framework's use in real-world clinical scenarios and its crucial links to systemic health. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will offer case-based problems to sharpen your diagnostic skills, ensuring you can confidently apply this essential tool in clinical practice.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions, a joint consensus of the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) and the European Federation of Periodontology (EFP), represents a fundamental paradigm shift in the diagnosis and management of these conditions. Moving beyond historical labels, the framework establishes a multidimensional system that captures disease severity, complexity, and the individual patient's risk profile. This chapter elucidates the core principles and mechanisms underpinning this modern classification system.

### A Unified Framework for a Single Disease Entity

A significant conceptual advance of the current classification is the replacement of the former "chronic" versus "aggressive" periodontitis labels with a single diagnosis of "periodontitis," which is then characterized by a staging and grading system. This change was not merely semantic but was driven by extensive evidence suggesting that periodontitis is a single, complex disease entity, rather than two distinct pathologies. Epidemiologic, microbiological, and host-response data consistently show that key disease metrics, such as the rate of clinical attachment loss (CAL), are distributed unimodally across the population. While mean progression rates may differ between younger and older patient groups, the distributions of progression, as well as microbiological and inflammatory biomarker profiles, overlap substantially. This undermines the scientific validity of a categorical separation based on age of onset or perceived [rapidity](@entry_id:265131) of progression [@problem_id:4700566].

Consequently, the new framework is built on the understanding that periodontitis is a biofilm-induced, host-mediated inflammatory disease whose clinical expression and progression rate lie on a continuous spectrum. The staging and grading system is designed to locate an individual patient along this spectrum. It improves diagnostic and prognostic validity by focusing on quantifiable measures of disease extent and risk, rather than on subjective labels that have demonstrated poor predictive power when adjusted for key risk factors [@problem_id:4700566].

The classification system is organized into four major categories for conditions affecting the natural dentition, with a parallel taxonomy for peri-implant tissues [@problem_id:4700570]:
1.  **Periodontal Health, Gingival Diseases, and Conditions**: Encompasses the spectrum from pristine health to biofilm-induced and non-biofilm-induced gingivitis.
2.  **Periodontitis**: The primary destructive disease entity, characterized by a multidimensional staging and grading system.
3.  **Other Conditions Affecting the Periodontium**: Includes periodontal abscesses, endodontic-periodontal lesions, mucogingival deformities, and traumatic occlusal forces.
4.  **Peri-implant Diseases and Conditions**: A parallel classification system for tissues surrounding dental implants, comprising peri-implant health, peri-implant mucositis, peri-implantitis, and soft/hard tissue deficiencies.

### Defining Periodontal Health and Gingival Diseases

The entire classification system is anchored to a precise definition of health, from which all disease states are a deviation.

#### Periodontal Health

Periodontal health can be defined for both an intact periodontium (one with no history of attachment or bone loss) and a reduced periodontium (one with pre-existing loss, either from periodontitis or other causes).

For a patient with an **intact periodontium**, the formal definition of clinical health requires the absence of periodontitis-related attachment loss, characterized by [@problem_id:4700575]:
-   No interdental clinical attachment level (CAL) loss.
-   Probing depths (PD) $\leq 3$ mm at all sites.
-   Bleeding on probing (BOP) at $ 10\%$ of sites.

In this context, BOP serves as a clinical surrogate for gingival inflammation, reflecting microvascular fragility. A threshold of $ 10\%$ acknowledges minor measurement variability while establishing a clear boundary for clinically significant inflammation.

A more nuanced and clinically vital definition applies to a patient with a **reduced periodontium**, particularly one who has been successfully treated for periodontitis. For such a patient, "health" is synonymous with **stability**. Stability does not mean the regeneration of lost tissues but the arrest of disease progression. The criteria for a stable, reduced periodontium in a treated periodontitis patient are [@problem_id:4700541]:
-   Full-mouth BOP score $ 10\%$.
-   No probing depths of $4$ mm or greater that also exhibit BOP.

This definition allows for the presence of deeper, non-inflamed sulci (up to $4$ mm) that are a common sequela of successful therapy. However, the combination of a deeper pocket and inflammation (BOP) at the same site signifies a locus of instability and potential disease recurrence.

#### Plaque-Induced Gingivitis

Gingivitis is defined as biofilm-induced inflammation of the gingiva without the loss of periodontal attachment. It is a reversible condition. The diagnostic threshold separating health from gingivitis is based on the extent of inflammation. A patient is diagnosed with **plaque-induced gingivitis** when BOP is present at $\ge 10\%$ of sites, but the criteria for periodontitis are not met [@problem_id:4700543]. For instance, a patient with BOP at $18\%$ of sites, no probing depths greater than $3$ mm, and no detectable interdental CAL would be diagnosed with gingivitis on an intact periodontium. The presence of visible plaque biofilm confirms the etiology.

### Periodontitis: Diagnosis, Staging, and Grading

Periodontitis is an irreversible, inflammatory condition characterized by the loss of the tooth-supporting tissues, including the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. Its diagnosis and classification require a systematic, multi-step process.

#### The Case Definition of Periodontitis

The gateway to the periodontitis classification is a precise case definition. A patient is diagnosed as a "periodontitis case" if, after a full-mouth periodontal examination, at least one of the following criteria is met [@problem_id:4700615]:

1.  **Interdental CAL is detectable at $\ge 2$ non-adjacent teeth.**
2.  **Buccal or oral CAL of $\ge 3$ mm with probing depth $> 3$ mm is detectable at $\ge 2$ teeth.**

A critical component of this definition is the exclusion of CAL attributable to non-periodontitis causes. The clinician must rule out other sources of attachment loss, such as:
-   Gingival recession of traumatic origin (e.g., from toothbrushing).
-   Dental caries extending to or apical to the cementoenamel junction (CEJ).
-   CAL on the distal aspect of a second molar associated with malposition or extraction of a third molar.
-   An endodontic lesion draining through the marginal periodontium.
-   The presence of a vertical root fracture.

Failure to exclude these conditions can lead to a misdiagnosis of periodontitis [@problem_id:4700615].

#### Staging: Assessing Disease Severity and Complexity

Once a patient is identified as a periodontitis case, a **Stage** (I-IV) is assigned. Staging primarily describes the **severity** of past tissue destruction and the **complexity** of managing the case. Staging is determined by the most severe finding present [@problem_id:4700538].

-   **Stage I: Initial Periodontitis**
    -   **Severity**: Interdental CAL of $1-2$ mm; Radiographic Bone Loss (RBL) confined to the coronal third ($15\%$).
    -   **Complexity**: Maximum probing depth $\leq 4$ mm; primarily horizontal bone loss.
    -   **Tooth Loss**: No tooth loss due to periodontitis.

-   **Stage II: Moderate Periodontitis**
    -   **Severity**: Interdental CAL of $3-4$ mm; RBL in the coronal third ($15-33\%$).
    -   **Complexity**: Maximum probing depth $\leq 5$ mm; primarily horizontal bone loss.
    -   **Tooth Loss**: No tooth loss due to periodontitis.

-   **Stage III: Severe Periodontitis with Potential for Additional Tooth Loss**
    -   **Severity**: Interdental CAL $\ge 5$ mm; RBL extending to the middle third of the root or beyond.
    -   **Complexity**: Probing depths $\ge 6$ mm, vertical bone defects $\ge 3$ mm, and/or Class II or III furcation involvement.
    -   **Tooth Loss**: $\le 4$ teeth lost due to periodontitis.

-   **Stage IV: Advanced Periodontitis with Potential for Loss of the Dentition**
    -   **Severity**: All criteria for Stage III.
    -   **Complexity**: Includes all Stage III complexity factors plus additional issues such as masticatory dysfunction, secondary occlusal trauma, severe ridge defects, bite collapse, or $ 20$ remaining teeth.
    -   **Tooth Loss**: $\ge 5$ teeth lost due to periodontitis.

#### Grading: Assessing Risk of Future Progression

While staging describes the current extent of damage, **Grading** (A, B, or C) aims to estimate the future risk of disease progression and helps guide the intensity and frequency of therapy. The grade is determined by assessing direct or indirect evidence of progression and is then modified by the presence of major risk factors [@problem_id:4700629].

-   **Initial Grade Determination (Indirect Evidence)**: In the absence of longitudinal data, the ratio of radiographic bone loss to age ($\%\text{RBL}/\text{age}$) is used as a proxy for progression rate. The maximum percentage of RBL at any site is divided by the patient's age.
    -   **Grade A (Slow Progression)**: $\%\text{RBL}/\text{age}  0.25$.
    -   **Grade B (Moderate Progression)**: $\%\text{RBL}/\text{age}$ ratio between $0.25$ and $1.0$. This is the default initial grade.
    -   **Grade C (Rapid Progression)**: $\%\text{RBL}/\text{age} > 1.0$.

-   **Grade Modification (Risk Factors)**: The initial grade can be shifted based on well-established risk factors.
    -   **Smoking**: A patient who smokes $\ge 10$ cigarettes per day is upgraded to Grade C.
    -   **Diabetes Mellitus**: A patient with an HbA1c level of $\ge 7.0\%$ is upgraded to Grade C.

For example, a $50$-year-old patient with maximum RBL of $35\%$ would have a $\%\text{RBL}/\text{age}$ ratio of $35/50 = 0.70$, initially suggesting Grade B. However, if this patient smokes $12$ cigarettes per day, the grade is modified to Grade C, reflecting a higher risk of future progression despite the moderate rate of past progression [@problem_id:4700629].

### A Parallel Classification for Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions

Biofilm-induced inflammation can affect the tissues surrounding dental implants in a manner analogous to how it affects periodontal tissues. However, due to critical anatomical and biological differences—notably the absence of a periodontal ligament, a different collagen fiber orientation, and a distinct vascular supply—peri-implant conditions are classified using a parallel but separate taxonomy [@problem_id:4700570].

#### Peri-Implant Health

Peri-implant health is defined by the absence of clinical signs of soft tissue inflammation (no BOP or suppuration) and, most importantly, the absence of further bone loss beyond the initial phase of physiologic bone remodeling. This initial remodeling, which can be approximately $1-2$ mm during the first year after implant restoration, is considered a normal adaptive process and is not a sign of disease. Health is therefore characterized by **bone level stability** after this initial phase has completed [@problem_id:4700564]. Unlike in periodontics, absolute probing depth around an implant is a less reliable indicator of health, as deeper, non-inflamed sites can be healthy depending on mucosal thickness and restoration design.

#### Peri-Implant Mucositis

Peri-implant mucositis is the analog of gingivitis. It is a reversible, biofilm-induced inflammatory condition confined to the peri-implant soft tissues. The definitive diagnosis is based on the presence of **bleeding and/or suppuration on probing** in the **absence of progressive bone loss** beyond the initial remodeling. A clinical case presenting with BOP, erythema, and stable probing depths and radiographic bone levels compared to baseline is classified as peri-implant mucositis [@problem_id:4700550].

#### Peri-Implantitis

Peri-implantitis is a destructive inflammatory process affecting both the soft and hard tissues around an osseointegrated implant, leading to progressive loss of supporting bone. The key feature that distinguishes it from mucositis is **radiographic evidence of bone loss** in the presence of inflammation [@problem_id:4700550]. The specific diagnostic criteria depend on the availability of baseline records [@problem_id:4700583]:

-   **When baseline radiographs and probing depths are available**: Peri-implantitis is diagnosed in the presence of inflammation (BOP and/or suppuration), an increase in probing depth from baseline, and radiographic evidence of progressive bone loss compared to the post-remodeling baseline radiograph. For example, a $2$ mm increase in bone loss between year $1$ and year $5$ post-restoration, combined with BOP and increased PD, constitutes peri-implantitis.

-   **When baseline records are not available**: A presumptive diagnosis of peri-implantitis is made in the presence of inflammation (BOP and/or suppuration) and a radiographic bone level $\ge 3$ mm apical to the most coronal intraosseous part of the implant.

This systematic framework provides clinicians with a robust, evidence-based approach to diagnose disease, assess risk, and formulate predictable treatment plans for both periodontal and peri-implant conditions.
