The data points $(t_i, z_i)$ are $(0, 1.2)$, $(2, 2.0)$, and $(5, 4.5)$, where $z$ (RBL) is in $\\mathrm{mm}$. The time values and their sums are the same as above.\n- $\\sum z_i = 1.2 + 2.0 + 4.5 = 7.7$\n- $\\sum (t_i z_i) = (0)(1.2) + (2)(2.0) + (5)(4.5) = 0 + 4.0 + 22.5 = 26.5$\n\nSubstituting into the slope formula for $s_{\\mathrm{RBL}}$:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{RBL}} = \\frac{3 \\times 26.5 - 7 \\times 7.7}{3 \\times 29 - (7)^2} = \\frac{79.5 - 53.9}{87 - 49} = \\frac{25.6}{38} = \\frac{12.8}{19} \\, \\mathrm{mm} \\cdot \\mathrm{year}^{-1}$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Composite Progression Index ($G$)**\n\nThe index $G$ is a weighted sum of the two progression rates: $G = w_{\\mathrm{CAL}} \\, s_{\\mathrm{CAL}} + w_{\\mathrm{RBL}} \\, s_{\\mathrm{RBL}}$.\nGiven weights are $w_{\\mathrm{CAL}} = 0.60$ and $w_{\\mathrm{RBL}} = 0.40$.\n$$G = (0.60) \\left(\\frac{16.1}{19}\\right) + (0.40) \\left(\\frac{12.8}{19}\\right) = \\frac{0.60 \\times 16.1 + 0.40 \\times 12.8}{19}$$\n$$G = \\frac{9.66 + 5.12}{19} = \\frac{14.78}{19} \\, \\mathrm{mm} \\cdot \\mathrm{year}^{-1}$$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Steady-State IL-1β Concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{IL1}}$)**\n\nThe steady-state concentration is given by $C_{\\mathrm{IL1}} = r_{\\mathrm{IL1}} / k_{c}$, where the production rate is $r_{\\mathrm{IL1}} = k_{1} \\, G$.\nThe constants are $k_1 = 600 \\, \\mathrm{pg} \\cdot \\mathrm{mL}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{mm}^{-1}$ and $k_c = 3.0 \\, \\mathrm{year}^{-1}$.\nCombining the equations, we have $C_{\\mathrm{IL1}} = \\frac{k_1 G}{k_c}$.\n$$C_{\\mathrm{IL1}} = \\frac{(600 \\, \\mathrm{pg} \\cdot \\mathrm{mL}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{mm}^{-1}) \\left(\\frac{14.78}{19} \\, \\mathrm{mm} \\cdot \\mathrm{year}^{-1}\\right)}{3.0 \\, \\mathrm{year}^{-1}}$$\nNotice that the units combine correctly: $(\\mathrm{pg} \\cdot \\mathrm{mL}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{mm}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{mm} \\cdot \\mathrm{year}^{-1}) / (\\mathrm{year}^{-1}) = \\mathrm{pg} \\cdot \\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$.\n$$C_{\\mathrm{IL1}} = \\frac{600 \\times 14.78}{19 \\times 3} = \\frac{200 \\times 14.78}{19} = \\frac{2956}{19} \\, \\mathrm{pg} \\cdot \\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$$\n\n**Step 6: Compute the MMP-8 Activation Fraction ($A$)**\n\nThe fraction of active MMP-8 is given by the Hill equation:\n$$A = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{IL1}}^{n}}{K^{n} + C_{\\mathrm{IL1}}^{n}}$$\nWith Hill coefficient $n=2$ and half-activation constant $K = 100 \\, \\mathrm{pg} \\cdot \\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$. It is computationally simpler to rearrange this as:\n$$A = \\frac{(C_{\\mathrm{IL1}}/K)^n}{1 + (C_{\\mathrm{IL1}}/K)^n}$$\nFirst, we compute the ratio of the concentration to the half-activation constant:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{IL1}}}{K} = \\frac{2956/19 \\, \\mathrm{pg} \\cdot \\mathrm{mL}^{-1}}{100 \\, \\mathrm{pg} \\cdot \\mathrm{mL}^{-1}} = \\frac{2956}{1900} = \\frac{739}{475}$$\nNow, we substitute this ratio and $n=2$ into the equation for $A$:\n$$A = \\frac{(\\frac{739}{475})^2}{1 + (\\frac{739}{475})^2} = \\frac{739^2}{475^2 + 739^2}$$\nPerforming the calculations:\n- $739^2 = 546121$\n- $475^2 = 225625$\n- $475^2 + 739^2 = 225625 + 546121 = 771746$\n$$A = \\frac{546121}{771746} \\approx 0.7076403$$\n\n**Step 7: Final Answer Formulation**\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$A \\approx 0.7076$$\nThis is the predicted steady-state activation fraction of MMP-8 under the given model and conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7076}$$", "id": "4748216"}]}
