Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeting the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene estimates the total bacterial load as $10^7$ gene copies in health and $10^8$ gene copies in disease. Targeted absolute counting (e.g., digital polymerase chain reaction) for three sentinel taxa yields the following absolute counts (health to disease): Streptococcus spp. increases from $8 \\times 10^6$ to $1.6 \\times 10^7$, Porphyromonas gingivalis increases from $1 \\times 10^6$ to $4 \\times 10^7$, and Filifactor alocis increases from $1 \\times 10^6$ to $4.4 \\times 10^7$. Standard amplicon sequencing of the same aliquots produces relative abundances consistent with these totals: in health, Streptococcus spp. $0.80$, Porphyromonas gingivalis $0.10$, Filifactor alocis $0.10$; in disease, Streptococcus spp. $0.16$, Porphyromonas gingivalis $0.40$, Filifactor alocis $0.44$.\n\nA colleague, who only inspects the relative abundances, concludes that Streptococcus spp. “decreased” with disease.

The provided data is checked for internal consistency.\nThe relationship between absolute abundance ($A_i$), relative abundance ($r_i$), and total load ($N$) is $r_i = A_i / N$. The closure constraint is $\\sum_i r_i = 1$.\n\n- **Health Sample:**\n  - Sum of absolute counts: $(8 \\times 10^6) + (1 \\times 10^6) + (1 \\times 10^6) = 10 \\times 10^6 = 10^7$. This matches $N_H$.\n  - Calculated relative abundances:\n    - $r_{S,H} = (8 \\times 10^6) / (10^7) = 0.8$. Matches.\n    - $r_{P,H} = (1 \\times 10^6) / (10^7) = 0.1$.

The data is consistent.\n\n- **Disease Sample:**\n  - Sum of absolute counts: $(1.6 \\times 10^7) + (4 \\times 10^7) + (4.4 \\times 10^7) = 10.0 \\times 10^7 = 10^8$.

The data is consistent.\n\nThe problem is well-posed, internally consistent, scientifically sound, and objective. It presents a realistic, albeit idealized, scenario to test fundamental principles of compositional data analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Adjudication and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the distinction between absolute and relative quantities. The colleague's error is inferring a change in an absolute quantity ($A_{S}$) from a change in a relative quantity ($r_{S}$) without accounting for the change in the total quantity ($N$).\n\nThe absolute abundance of *Streptococcus* spp. changes from $A_{S,H} = 8 \\times 10^6$ to $A_{S,D} = 1.6 \\times 10^7$. This is an increase by a factor of $2$. The colleague's conclusion that it \"decreased\" is factually incorrect. The relative abundance decreased because the total bacterial load increased by a factor of $10$ (from $10^7$ to $10^8$), while the absolute abundance of *Streptococcus* spp. only increased by a factor of $2$. The other two taxa increased by much larger factors ($40$ and $44$), driving the disproportionate increase in total load.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement:\n\n**A. The apparent decline in the relative abundance of Streptococcus spp. from $0.80$ to $0.16$ implies its absolute abundance must have decreased.**\n\n**Analysis:** This statement is a direct claim that can be tested with the provided data. The relative abundance of *Streptococcus* spp. did decline: $r_{S,D} = 0.16 < r_{S,H} = 0.80$. However, the absolute abundance increased: $A_{S,D} = 1.6 \\times 10^7 > A_{S,H} = 8 \\times 10^6$. The statement claims the former implies the latter, which is demonstrably false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Because relative abundances satisfy the closure constraint $\\sum_i r_i = 1$, a component’s proportion can decline even when its absolute count increases, if co-occurring components increase by a larger multiplicative factor; therefore, interpreting a relative decline as an absolute decline is not justified without total load information.**\n\n**Analysis:** This statement provides a correct theoretical explanation for the observed phenomenon. Let $A_i(t_1)$ and $A_i(t_2)$ be the absolute abundances of component $i$ at two time points, and let $N(t_1)$ and $N(t_2)$ be the total loads. The relative abundances are $r_i(t_1) = A_i(t_1)/N(t_1)$ and $r_i(t_2) = A_i(t_2)/N(t_2)$. It is possible to have $A_i(t_2) > A_i(t_1)$ while simultaneously having $r_i(t_2) < r_i(t_1)$. This occurs if the ratio $N(t_2)/N(t_1)$ is greater than the ratio $A_i(t_2)/A_i(t_1)$. The increase in the total load $N = \\sum_j A_j$ is driven by the growth of all components. If other components ($j \\neq i$) grow by a much larger factor than component $i$, they can inflate $N$ to the point where the proportion of $i$ decreases. This is precisely what the data shows. The conclusion that one cannot interpret relative decline as absolute decline without total load information is a fundamental tenet of compositional data analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. A valid compositional data approach is to transform each sample by taking, for each component, the natural logarithm of its value divided by the geometric mean of all components in that sample, and then compare those transformed values across samples; this yields a representation that is invariant to multiplicative changes in total load and interprets changes relative to the community.**\n\n**Analysis:** This statement describes the centered log-ratio (CLR) transformation. For a composition with $D$ parts, $\\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_D]$, the geometric mean is $g(\\mathbf{x}) = (\\prod_{j=1}^D x_j)^{1/D}$. The CLR transformation of the $i$-th component is $\\text{clr}(x_i) = \\ln(x_i/g(\\mathbf{x}))$. A key property of this transformation is its scale invariance. If we scale the entire composition by a constant factor $c > 0$, we get a new composition $\\mathbf{x'} = c\\mathbf{x} = [cx_1, ..., cx_D]$. The new geometric mean is $g(\\mathbf{x'}) = (\\prod_{j=1}^D cx_j)^{1/D} = c(\\prod_{j=1}^D x_j)^{1/D} = c \\cdot g(\\mathbf{x})$. The new CLR value is $\\text{clr}(x'_i) = \\ln(cx_i / (c \\cdot g(\\mathbf{x}))) = \\ln(x_i / g(\\mathbf{x})) = \\text{clr}(x_i)$. The transformed values are unchanged. This means the analysis is robust to unknown changes in total load (or sampling efficiency) that affect all components multiplicatively. It is a standard and valid approach in compositional data analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Replacing the geometric mean with the arithmetic mean in the denominator of the log transformation is equivalent for compositional analysis and preserves the same invariance properties.**\n\n**Analysis:** Let the arithmetic mean be $a(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{D}\\sum_{j=1}^D x_j$. The proposed transformation is $\\ln(x_i / a(\\mathbf{x}))$. Let's test the scale invariance. For a scaled composition $\\mathbf{x'} = c\\mathbf{x}$, the new arithmetic mean is $a(\\mathbf{x'}) = \\frac{1}{D}\\sum_{j=1}^D cx_j = c \\cdot a(\\mathbf{x})$. The new transformed value is $\\ln(cx_i / (c \\cdot a(\\mathbf{x}))) = \\ln(x_i / a(\\mathbf{x}))$. The invariance property is indeed preserved. However, the statement claims this is \"equivalent for compositional analysis.\" This is false. The geometric mean is central to Aitchison geometry because the logarithms of ratios form a linear vector space. The CLR transformation results in a set of values whose sum is zero: $\\sum_i \\text{clr}(x_i) = \\sum_i (\\ln x_i - \\ln g(\\mathbf{x})) = (\\sum_i \\ln x_i) - D \\ln g(\\mathbf{x}) = (\\sum_i \\ln x_i) - D (\\frac{1}{D} \\sum_i \\ln x_i) = 0$. This property is crucial for subsequent multivariate analysis. The transformation using the arithmetic mean does not generally yield a zero sum: $\\sum_i \\ln(x_i/a(\\mathbf{x})) = (\\sum_i \\ln x_i) - D \\ln a(\\mathbf{x}) \\neq 0$. Because it lacks this and other desirable geometric properties, it is not considered an equivalent approach.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. When zeros occur in sequencing counts, leaving zeros unchanged and taking natural logarithms is acceptable because zeros encode absence; adding a small positive pseudocount should be avoided.**\n\n**Analysis:** This statement is mathematically flawed. The natural logarithm function, $\\ln(x)$, is defined only for $x > 0$. The value $\\ln(0)$ is undefined. Therefore, it is not \"acceptable\" to \"leave zeros unchanged and take natural logarithms\"; it is impossible. The presence of zeros in compositional data is a significant theoretical and practical problem. While adding a small \"pseudocount\" is a simplistic and sometimes criticized method, it is a necessary practical step to avoid the undefined logarithm if one is to use log-ratio methods. The statement that this should be avoided while offering an impossible alternative is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. If absolute load information (for example, $16$S rRNA gene copies by qPCR) is available, one can recover absolute counts and compare those directly; the centered log-ratio analysis by itself removes the effect of multiplicative scaling by total load but cannot, on its own, recover absolute changes in biomass without external load information.**\n\n**Analysis:** This statement consists of two parts. First, if one has relative abundances ($r_i$) from sequencing and total load ($N$) from qPCR, one can calculate a proxy for absolute abundance via $A_i = r_i \\times N$. This allows for direct comparison of absolute quantities, bypassing the limitations of relative data. This is correct. Second, as established in the analysis of option C, the CLR transformation is scale-invariant. This means it is designed to be insensitive to the total load $N$. A necessary consequence is that information about $N$ is lost. Therefore, CLR-transformed data, by itself, cannot be used to infer changes in $N$ or absolute abundances. It only describes the change in the *relative* structure of the community. External information, like qPCR data, is required to anchor the relative data and make statements about absolute changes. The entire statement is a correct and succinct summary of the interplay between relative and absolute data.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCF}$$", "id": "4735115"}, {"introduction": "A central goal in clinical microbiology is to establish a clear, quantitative link between the burden of specific pathogens and observable signs of disease, which allows for the validation of etiological hypotheses and the development of diagnostic markers.

It is scientifically grounded in the field of biostatistics as applied to periodontal microbiology, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. The data provided are plausible for the described measurement techniques. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to determine the most appropriate correlation coefficient (Pearson or Spearman) to measure the association between a continuous variable, the red complex load ($x_i$), and a binary variable, bleeding on probing ($y_i$), and then to compute it and test its significance.\n\nFirst, we must decide between the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient, $r$, measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two continuous variables. Its calculation assumes that the variables are approximately normally distributed and that their relationship is linear. In this problem, the variable $x_i$ (log-transformed bacterial load) is continuous. The variable $y_i$ (bleeding on probing) is binary, taking values of $0$ or $1$. A binary variable is not continuous and cannot be normally distributed. However, when the Pearson correlation formula is applied to a pair of variables where one is continuous and the other is dichotomous (binary), the resulting coefficient is known as the point-biserial correlation coefficient ($r_{pb}$). This is a valid and widely used measure of association, and it is mathematically equivalent to the Pearson $r$ calculated directly on the given data. Its square, $r_{pb}^2$, represents the proportion of variance in the continuous variable that is explained by the binary variable.\n\nThe Spearman rank correlation coefficient, $\\rho$ or $r_s$, is a non-parametric measure of association. It assesses the strength and direction of a monotonic relationship (whether linear or not) between two variables. It operates on the ranks of the data rather than the raw values, and thus does not require assumptions of normality or linearity. It is suitable for ordinal, interval, or ratio data. Since a binary variable can be treated as ordinal (e.g., $0 < 1$), Spearman correlation is also a possible choice.\n\nGiven the data, there are no extreme outliers in the $x_i$ values that would strongly favor a rank-based method. The relationship, upon inspection, appears to be monotonic. The use of Pearson's formula in this context yields the point-biserial correlation, which has a straightforward interpretation and is a standard method for this type of data pairing. Therefore, the Pearson correlation is an appropriate, if not the most conventional, choice.

Round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The objective is to compute the free $24$-hour area-under-the-curve to minimum inhibitory concentration ratio for metronidazole, denoted as $f\\mathrm{AUC}_{0-24}/\\mathrm{MIC}_{\\text{met}}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between dose, bioavailability, clearance, and the area under the concentration-time curve ($\\mathrm{AUC}$) from fundamental principles. At steady state, the rate of drug administration equals the rate of drug elimination. For an orally administered drug, the average rate of administration over a dosing interval, $\\tau$, is the amount of drug that reaches the systemic circulation per unit time. This is given by:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Administration} = \\frac{D \\times F}{\\tau} $$\nwhere $D$ is the dose, $F$ is the absolute oral bioavailability, and $\\tau$ is the dosing interval.\n\nThe average rate of elimination is defined by the product of total body clearance ($\\mathrm{CL}$) and the average steady-state plasma concentration ($C_{\\text{ss,avg}}$):\n$$ \\text{Rate of Elimination} = \\mathrm{CL} \\times C_{\\text{ss,avg}} $$\nThe average steady-state concentration is defined as the area under the curve over one dosing interval, $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau}$, divided by the length of that interval:\n$$ C_{\\text{ss,avg}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau}}{\\tau} $$\nSubstituting this into the rate of elimination equation gives:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Elimination} = \\mathrm{CL} \\times \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau}}{\\tau} $$\nAt steady state, equating the rate of administration and the rate of elimination:\n$$ \\frac{D \\times F}{\\tau} = \\mathrm{CL} \\times \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau}}{\\tau} $$\nMultiplying both sides by $\\tau$ yields the fundamental relationship for the area under the curve over a single dosing interval at steady state:\n$$ \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau} = \\frac{D \\cdot F}{\\mathrm{CL}} $$\nThis principle can be extended to any time interval at steady state. For the $24$-hour interval requested, we can use the total daily dose. The metronidazole regimen is $500$ mg every $8$ hours, which corresponds to $3$ doses in a $24$-hour period.\nThe total daily dose, $D_{24}$, for metronidazole is:\n$$ D_{24, \\text{met}} = 3 \\times 500 \\text{ mg} = 1500 \\text{ mg} $$\nThe total area under the curve over $24$ hours, $\\mathrm{AUC}_{0-24, \\text{met}}$, can now be calculated using the total daily dose and the provided pharmacokinetic parameters for metronidazole: $F_{\\text{met}} = 0.99$ and $\\mathrm{CL}_{\\text{met}} = 6.0$ L/h.\n$$ \\mathrm{AUC}_{0-24, \\text{met}} = \\frac{D_{24, \\text{met}} \\times F_{\\text{met}}}{\\mathrm{CL}_{\\text{met}}} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ \\mathrm{AUC}_{0-24, \\text{met}} = \\frac{1500 \\text{ mg} \\times 0.99}{6.0 \\text{ L/h}} = \\frac{1485}{6.0} \\frac{\\text{mg} \\cdot \\text{h}}{\\text{L}} = 247.5 \\frac{\\text{mg} \\cdot \\text{h}}{\\text{L}} $$\nThis is the $\\mathrm{AUC}$ for the total (bound and unbound) drug concentration. The PK/PD index requires the free or unbound $\\mathrm{AUC}$, denoted $f\\mathrm{AUC}$. This is calculated by multiplying the total $\\mathrm{AUC}$ by the unbound fraction in plasma, $f_{\\text{u,met}}$.\nThe unbound fraction for metronidazole, $f_{\\text{u,met}}$, is given as $0.80$.\n$$ f\\mathrm{AUC}_{0-24, \\text{met}} = f_{\\text{u,met}} \\times \\mathrm{AUC}_{0-24, \\text{met}} $$\n$$ f\\mathrm{AUC}_{0-24, \\text{met}} = 0.80 \\times 247.5 \\frac{\\text{mg} \\cdot \\text{h}}{\\text{L}} = 198 \\frac{\\text{mg} \\cdot \\text{h}}{\\text{L}} $$\nFinally, we compute the desired ratio by dividing the free $\\mathrm{AUC}_{0-24}$ by the minimum inhibitory concentration for metronidazole, $\\mathrm{MIC}_{\\text{met}}$, which is given as $0.50$ mg/L.\n$$ \\frac{f\\mathrm{AUC}_{0-24, \\text{met}}}{\\mathrm{MIC}_{\\text{met}}} = \\frac{198 \\frac{\\text{mg} \\cdot \\text{h}}{\\text{L}}}{0.50 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}}} $$\nThe units $\\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}}$ cancel, leaving the result with units of hours (h). However, the problem asks for a pure number, which is a common convention for this PK/PD index.\n$$ \\frac{f\\mathrm{AUC}_{0-24, \\text{met}}}{\\mathrm{MIC}_{\\text{met}}} = \\frac{198}{0.50} = 396 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $396$ is already expressed with three significant figures. Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{396}$$", "id": "4735074"}]}
