A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation**\n\nThe problem requires a derivation from first principles. We begin by defining the primary epidemiological measures.\n\nLet $R_U$ be the risk of developing new dentin caries in the untreated (control) cohort over the specified time period.\nLet $R_T$ be the risk of developing new dentin caries in the treated (intervention) cohort over the same time period.\n\nFrom the problem statement, risk is defined as the incidence proportion. We are given:\n- Risk in the untreated cohort, $R_U = 0.30$\n- Risk in the treated cohort, $R_T = 0.20$\nThe time horizon for these risks is $1$ year.\n\nThe absolute effect of the treatment is quantified by the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR). The problem defines the treatment effect as the difference in risks. The ARR is the arithmetic difference between the risk in the control group and the risk in the treatment group. It represents the proportion of individuals who are spared the outcome of interest (caries) due to the intervention.\n\nThe formula for ARR is derived directly from this definition:\n$$ARR = R_U - R_T$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ARR = 0.30 - 0.20 = 0.10$$\nThe problem requires this value to be reported to four significant figures. Therefore:\n$$ARR = 0.1000$$\n\nNext, we derive the Number Needed to Treat (NNT). The NNT represents the average number of patients who need to be treated with the specific intervention for a defined period of time to prevent one additional adverse outcome. It is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction.\n\nTo derive this from first principles, consider the meaning of ARR. An $ARR$ of $0.10$ means that for every $100$ people treated, we prevent $0.10 \\times 100 = 10$ cases of caries. If $10$ cases are prevented by treating $100$ people, then to prevent $1$ case of caries, the number of people we must treat is:\n$$ \\text{Number to treat} = \\frac{100 \\text{ people}}{10 \\text{ cases prevented}} = 10 \\text{ people per case prevented} $$\nThis logic generalizes to the formula:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nThis formula is valid for $ARR > 0$, which is true in this case since the treatment is effective ($R_U > R_T$).\n\nSubstituting the calculated value of $ARR$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.10} = 10$$\nThe problem requires this value to be reported to four significant figures. Therefore:\n$$NNT = 10.00$$\n\n**Interpretation of Clinical Significance**\n\nThe calculated Absolute Risk Reduction is $ARR = 0.1000$. This signifies that the application of biannual fluoride varnish reduces the absolute risk of developing new dentin caries over a $1$-year period by $10.0$ percentage points compared to standard hygiene instruction alone.\n\nThe calculated Number Needed to Treat is $NNT = 10.00$ for a $1$-year horizon. This means that, on average, for every $10$ schoolchildren in this population who receive biannual fluoride varnish for one year, one case of new dentin caries is prevented that would have otherwise occurred. In the context of public health and preventive medicine, an NNT of $10$ is generally considered to indicate a highly effective intervention. A lower NNT signifies a more potent treatment effect. For a non-invasive, low-cost preventive measure like fluoride varnish, this result demonstrates substantial clinical significance and provides strong evidence to support its implementation in a high-risk community setting.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.1000  10.00 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4756806"}, {"introduction": "While fluoride is a cornerstone of caries prevention, its safe use is paramount, especially in young children.

In preventive dentistry, the probable toxic dose (PTD) of fluoride is defined as $5$ mg of fluoride ion per kg of body mass. Starting from the core definitions that a dose in mg/kg scales linearly with body mass, and that a concentration in parts per million (ppm) denotes mg of solute per kg of product, derive the toddler-specific PTD of fluoride ion and, under a worst-case assumption of complete systemic availability of fluoride ion from the dentifrice and immediate ingestion without post-ingestion losses, calculate the mass of this toothpaste that would deliver the PTD.

A rigorous solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the mass of a specific dentifrice that corresponds to the Probable Toxic Dose (PTD) of fluoride for a toddler of a given body mass. It also asks for an outline of clinical management principles. We will first perform the quantitative derivation and then provide the requested qualitative explanation.\n\nThe givens are:\n- Toddler's body mass, $m_{body} = 12$ kg.\n- The Probable Toxic Dose of fluoride ion, expressed as a specific dose, $D_{PTD,spec} = 5$ mg F⁻/kg body mass.\n- The concentration of fluoride ion in the dentifrice, $C_{F, dentifrice}$, is $1450$ ppm.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total mass of fluoride ion that constitutes the PTD for this specific toddler. The problem states that the dose scales linearly with body mass. Therefore, the total toxic mass of fluoride, $M_{F, PTD}$, is the product of the specific dose and the toddler's body mass.\n$$M_{F, PTD} = D_{PTD,spec} \\times m_{body}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$M_{F, PTD} = \\left(5 \\frac{\\text{mg F}^-}{\\text{kg}}\\right) \\times (12 \\text{ kg}) = 60 \\text{ mg F}^-$$\nThis is the threshold mass of ingested fluoride ion that is considered potentially toxic for this child.\n\nNext, we must determine the mass of dentifrice that contains this amount of fluoride. The concentration is given as $1450$ ppm. The problem defines ppm as \"mg of solute per kg of product.\" Following the problem's direction to state any necessary chemical assumptions, we assume, as strongly implied by the label \"$1450$ ppm fluoride ion\", that the solute is the fluoride ion ($F^−$) itself, not the entire sodium fluoride ($NaF$) compound from which it is derived.\n\nTherefore, the concentration $C_{F, dentifrice}$ can be written as:\n$$C_{F, dentifrice} = 1450 \\text{ ppm} = 1450 \\frac{\\text{mg F}^-}{\\text{kg dentifrice}}$$\nTo facilitate the calculation, it is convenient to convert the units of this concentration from milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) to milligrams per gram (mg/g). Since $1$ kg = $1000$ g:\n$$C_{F, dentifrice} = 1450 \\frac{\\text{mg F}^-}{1000 \\text{ g dentifrice}} = 1.45 \\frac{\\text{mg F}^-}{\\text{g dentifrice}}$$\n\nThe total mass of fluoride ingested, $M_{F, ingested}$, is the product of the mass of the dentifrice swallowed, $m_{dentifrice}$, and the concentration of fluoride within it, $C_{F, dentifrice}$.\n$$M_{F, ingested} = m_{dentifrice} \\times C_{F, dentifrice}$$\nThe problem asks for the mass of dentifrice that delivers the PTD. Therefore, we set the ingested fluoride mass equal to the calculated PTD mass, $M_{F, PTD}$.\n$$M_{F, PTD} = m_{dentifrice} \\times C_{F, dentifrice}$$\nWe can now solve for the mass of the dentifrice, $m_{dentifrice}$:\n$$m_{dentifrice} = \\frac{M_{F, PTD}}{C_{F, dentifrice}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $M_{F, PTD}$ and $C_{F, dentifrice}$:\n$$m_{dentifrice} = \\frac{60 \\text{ mg F}^-}{1.45 \\frac{\\text{mg F}^-}{\\text{g dentifrice}}} \\approx 41.3793... \\text{ g dentifrice}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$m_{dentifrice} \\approx 41.4 \\text{ g}$$\n\nFinally, the problem asks for an outline of immediate first-aid and clinical management steps. Ingestion at or above the PTD ($5$ mg/kg) warrants emergency intervention.\nThe rationale for management is based on the pathophysiology of acute fluoride toxicity. In the acidic environment of the stomach, fluoride ions ($F^−$) combine with hydrogen ions ($H^+$) to form hydrofluoric acid ($HF$), which is a corrosive agent that damages the gastric mucosa, leading to symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Systemically, absorbed fluoride ions are potent binders of divalent cations, particularly calcium ($Ca^{2+}$). The resulting acute hypocalcemia can lead to neuromuscular effects (tetany) and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.\n\nThe management steps are as follows:\n1.  **Immediate First-Aid (Pre-hospital):** The primary goal is to bind the fluoride in the gastrointestinal tract to prevent its absorption. The caregiver should be instructed to give the child a calcium-containing liquid, such as milk. The calcium in milk ($Ca^{2+}$) will precipitate with the fluoride ions ($F^−$) to form insoluble calcium fluoride ($CaF_2$), a compound that is poorly absorbed. Vomiting should not be induced unless directed by a poison control center or medical professional, due to the risk of further esophageal injury from the reflux of hydrofluoric acid. Immediate contact with a poison control center and/or transport to an emergency facility is critical.\n\n2.  **Clinical Management (Hospital):**\n    - **Gastric Decontamination:** Gastric lavage may be considered if the ingestion is recent and massive, but this is done with caution. Administration of oral calcium (e.g., calcium gluconate or calcium carbonate) can continue to bind ingested fluoride.\n    - **Monitoring:** The patient must be placed on continuous cardiac monitoring (ECG) to detect QTc interval prolongation or arrhythmias indicative of hypocalcemia. Vital signs and electrolyte levels (serum calcium, magnesium, potassium) must be monitored frequently.\n    - **Systemic Correction:** If evidence of systemic toxicity (e.g., symptomatic hypocalcemia, ECG changes) is present, intravenous calcium gluconate is administered slowly to restore normal serum calcium levels and protect the heart.\n    - **Supportive Care:** Intravenous fluids are given to maintain hydration, correct electrolyte imbalances, and support renal excretion of fluoride. Acid-base status is also monitored and corrected as needed.
