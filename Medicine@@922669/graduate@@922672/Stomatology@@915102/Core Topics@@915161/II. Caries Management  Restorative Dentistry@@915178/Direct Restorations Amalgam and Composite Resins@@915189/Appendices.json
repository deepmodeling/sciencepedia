All necessary definitions, assumptions, and data are provided to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to first derive a symbolic expression for the residual stress, $\\sigma$, as a function of the configuration factor, $C$, and then compute the ratio of stresses for two given values of $C$.\n\nThe analysis starts with Hooke's law for a linear elastic solid. In its simplest, one-dimensional form, stress $\\sigma$ is proportional to strain $\\varepsilon$:\n$$ \\sigma = E \\cdot \\varepsilon $$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus. In this context, the relevant strain is the portion of the free polymerization shrinkage that is constrained by the bonded cavity walls, which we denote as $\\varepsilon_{\\text{constrained}}$. Therefore, the residual stress is given by:\n$$ \\sigma = E \\cdot \\varepsilon_{\\text{constrained}} $$\n\nThe problem provides a \"mean-field boundary-constraint model\" which postulates that the average constrained shrinkage strain, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{constrained}}$, scales linearly with the fraction of the total boundary area that is constrained. The total boundary area, $A_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the bonded area, $A_{\\text{bonded}}$, and the unbonded (free) area, $A_{\\text{free}}$.\n$$ A_{\\text{total}} = A_{\\text{bonded}} + A_{\\text{free}} $$\nThe fraction of constrained boundary area is therefore $\\frac{A_{\\text{bonded}}}{A_{\\text{bonded}} + A_{\\text{free}}}$.\n\nThe maximum possible strain that can be generated is the free polymerization shrinkage strain, $\\varepsilon_{0}$. The model states that $\\varepsilon_{\\text{constrained}}$ is proportional to this fraction. We can express this relationship as:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{constrained}} = k \\cdot \\varepsilon_{0} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{A_{\\text{bonded}}}{A_{\\text{bonded}} + A_{\\text{free}}} \\right) $$\nwhere $k$ is a dimensionless proportionality constant that accounts for geometric and other factors.\n\nThe problem defines the configuration factor, or C-factor, as $C = \\frac{A_{\\text{bonded}}}{A_{\\text{free}}}$. We must re-express the fraction of constrained area in terms of $C$. Assuming $A_{\\text{free}} > 0$ (which is true for any finite $C$), we can divide the numerator and denominator of the fraction by $A_{\\text{free}}$:\n$$ \\frac{A_{\\text{bonded}}}{A_{\\text{bonded}} + A_{\\text{free}}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{bonded}}/A_{\\text{free}}}{(A_{\\text{bonded}}/A_{\\text{free}}) + (A_{\\text{free}}/A_{\\text{free}})} = \\frac{C}{C + 1} $$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the constrained strain gives:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{constrained}} = k \\cdot \\varepsilon_{0} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{C}{C + 1} \\right) $$\n\nNow, we can find the expression for the residual stress $\\sigma$ by substituting this into Hooke's law:\n$$ \\sigma(C) = E \\cdot \\left( k \\cdot \\varepsilon_{0} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{C}{C + 1} \\right) \\right) = (k E \\varepsilon_{0}) \\left( \\frac{C}{C + 1} \\right) $$\nAs requested, this is a symbolic expression for the residual stress up to a common multiplicative constant. We can define this constant as $K = k E \\varepsilon_{0}$. Since $E$ and $\\varepsilon_{0}$ are the same for both restorations and $k$ is a general model constant, $K$ is the same for both cases.\n$$ \\sigma(C) = K \\left( \\frac{C}{C+1} \\right) $$\n\nThe next step is to compute the ratio of residual stresses between the two specified cavities.\nFor the Class I cavity, the C-factor is $C_{1} = 5$. The corresponding stress is $\\sigma_{1}$.\n$$ \\sigma_{1} = K \\left( \\frac{C_{1}}{C_{1}+1} \\right) = K \\left( \\frac{5}{5+1} \\right) = K \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right) $$\nFor the Class IV cavity, the C-factor is $C_{2} = 0.5$. The corresponding stress is $\\sigma_{2}$.\n$$ \\sigma_{2} = K \\left( \\frac{C_{2}}{C_{2}+1} \\right) = K \\left( \\frac{0.5}{0.5+1} \\right) = K \\left( \\frac{0.5}{1.5} \\right) $$\nSimplifying the fraction for $\\sigma_{2}$:\n$$ \\frac{0.5}{1.5} = \\frac{1/2}{3/2} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nSo, the stress is:\n$$ \\sigma_{2} = K \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right) $$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio of the residual stress in the Class I cavity to that in the Class IV cavity, $\\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{\\sigma_{2}}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{\\sigma_{2}} = \\frac{K \\left( \\frac{5}{6} \\right)}{K \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)} $$\nThe constant $K$ cancels out.\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{\\sigma_{2}} = \\frac{5/6}{1/3} = \\frac{5}{6} \\times \\frac{3}{1} = \\frac{15}{6} $$\nSimplifying the final fraction gives:\n$$ \\frac{15}{6} = \\frac{5 \\times 3}{2 \\times 3} = \\frac{5}{2} $$\nAs a decimal, this is $2.5$.

The analysis is predicated on a linear elastic model.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem. The problem is scientifically grounded in the established principles of material mechanics and the clinical phenomenon of polymerization shrinkage in dental restorations. It provides a set of quantitative parameters and clear definitions, making it well-posed and objective. The provided values are within realistic ranges for the described materials and clinical situation. A potential ambiguity exists regarding the mechanical model for the composite's shrinkage force. A fully rigorous model would account for the compliance of the composite itself, which would require the inter-cuspal distance—a parameter that is not provided. However, the problem's explicit guidance to use the fundamental definitions $\\sigma = E\\varepsilon$ and $F = \\sigma A$ suggests a simplified model where the composite acts as a pure force generator. In this model, the shrinkage force is calculated based on the properties of the composite as if it were bonded to an infinitely rigid structure, and this force is then applied to the compliant tooth structure. We will proceed with this interpretation, as it allows for a self-contained solution using only the provided data.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three main steps as requested.\n\nStep 1: Derivation and calculation of the cusp separation, $\\delta_c$.\n\nThe shrinkage of the composite generates an internal stress. Following the implied simplified model, we first calculate the theoretical stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{sh}}$, that would develop if the composite were perfectly constrained (i.e., bonded to infinitely rigid walls). This stress is given by the product of the effective shrinkage modulus, $E_{\\mathrm{sh}}$, and the constrained linear shrinkage strain, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{sh}}$.\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{sh}} = E_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{sh}} $$\nThis stress acts over the net bonded area, $A_b$, generating a total contraction force, $F_{\\mathrm{sh}}$, that pulls the cusps together.\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{sh}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{sh}} A_b = E_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{sh}} A_b $$\nThis force acts on the tooth cusps, which respond as a linear spring with a given stiffness, $k_t$. The resulting deflection of the cusps (i.e., the reduction in inter-cusp distance) is denoted by $\\delta_c$. According to the linear spring response equation, $\\delta = F/k$, we have:\n$$ \\delta_c = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{sh}}}{k_t} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $F_{\\mathrm{sh}}$ gives the final expression for the cusp separation in terms of the given parameters:\n$$ \\delta_c = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{sh}} A_b}{k_t} $$\n\nStep 2: Derivation and calculation of the marginal tensile strain, $\\varepsilon_m$.\n\nThe cusp separation, $\\delta_c$, is geometrically related to the opening displacement at the occlusal margin, $\\delta_m$, through the transfer factor, $g$.\n$$ \\delta_m = g \\delta_c $$\nThis marginal opening, $\\delta_m$, represents the amount the adhesive layer at the margin is stretched. The resulting tensile strain in the adhesive layer, $\\varepsilon_m$, is this displacement divided by the original thickness of the adhesive layer, $t$.\n$$ \\varepsilon_m = \\frac{\\delta_m}{t} $$\nBy substituting the expressions for $\\delta_m$ and $\\delta_c$, we can express $\\varepsilon_m$ directly in terms of the initial parameters:\n$$ \\varepsilon_m = \\frac{g \\delta_c}{t} = \\frac{g}{t} \\left( \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{sh}} A_b}{k_t} \\right) = \\frac{g E_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{sh}} A_b}{t k_t} $$\n\nStep 3: Calculation of the safety factor, $S$.\n\nThe safety factor, $S$, is defined as the ratio of the adhesive's ultimate tensile strain before failure, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{fail}}$, to the calculated marginal tensile strain, $\\varepsilon_m$.\n$$ S = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{fail}}}{\\varepsilon_m} $$\n\nNow, we will substitute the numerical values provided, ensuring all units are consistent.
