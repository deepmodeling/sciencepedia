Extraction of Givens:**\n-   **Reactors**: Two parallel flow-cell reactors, $S$ and $G$.\n-   **Substrate**: Bovine enamel slabs.\n-   **Conditions**: Identical hydrodynamics and buffer conditions.\n-   **Feeding Regimen**: Three carbohydrate pulses per day for $2$ days ($48$ hours).\n-   **Pulse Characteristics**: Duration of $10$ minutes, concentration of $1\\%$ (mass/volume).\n-   **Carbohydrates**: Reactor $S$ is pulsed with sucrose; Reactor $G$ is pulsed with glucose.\n-   **Biological Equivalence**: Viable counts and glycolytic capacity per unit biomass are comparable at $48$ hours.\n-   **Bulk Fluid**: Saliva analog at pH $7.0$ with bicarbonate at $5$ millimoles per liter.\n-   **Biofilm Structure**: Sucrose-grown biofilms ($S$) have a higher volume fraction of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and higher tortuosity than glucose-grown biofilms ($G$).\n-   **Transport Property**: The effective diffusion coefficient for small solutes satisfies $D_{\\mathrm{eff},S} \\ll D_{\\mathrm{eff},G}$.\n-   **Model**: One-dimensional diffusion-reaction layer normal to the enamel surface.\n-   **Reaction Term**: Local proton production rate density, $r_H$, is similar in both reactors for a given depth and time.\n-   **Transport Law**: Flux $J$ obeys Fick's law, $J = -D_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\frac{dC}{dx}$.\n-   **Dissolution Principle**: Hydroxyapatite dissolution increases as pH decreases below a critical pH of approximately $5.5$.\n-   **Damage Metric**: The extent of demineralization scales with the time-integral of undersaturation below the critical pH at the enamel interface.\n\n**2. Validation Analysis:**\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in the established principles of cariology and biofilm science. Sucrose metabolism by oral bacteria is known to produce not only acids but also voluminous extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), particularly insoluble glucans. This increased EPS content is a primary reason for the increased density and tortuosity of sucrose-grown biofilms, leading to diffusion limitation. The concepts of a critical pH for demineralization, reaction-diffusion models for biofilm activity (the \"Stephan Curve\" dynamics), and Fickian transport are all standard in the field. The premises are scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear set of conditions, identifies a single key difference between the two systems (the effective diffusivity $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$), and asks for a logical deduction about the consequences. The simplified assumption of similar local proton production rates ($r_H$) makes the problem tractable and focuses the analysis on the role of mass transport, which is the intended core of the question.\n-   **Objectivity**: The language is precise and quantitative, avoiding subjective or ambiguous phrasing.\n\n**3. Verdict:**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe central issue is the interplay between the rate of acid production and the rate of mass transport of both the acid products and the buffering species within the biofilm matrix. We can model the local pH at the enamel interface ($x=0$) by considering the mass balance of protons ($H^+$).\n\nLet $C_{H^+}$ be the proton concentration. At pseudo-steady state during a carbohydrate pulse, the governing equation for proton concentration in the one-dimensional biofilm is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( D_{\\mathrm{eff}, H^+} \\frac{dC_{H^+}}{dx} \\right) + R_{H^+} = 0 $$\nwhere $D_{\\mathrm{eff}, H^+}$ is the effective diffusivity of protons and $R_{H^+}$ is the net rate of proton production. The net rate $R_{H^+}$ includes production from glycolysis ($r_H$) and consumption by the buffer system (e.g., $H^+ + \\text{HCO}_3^- \\rightleftharpoons H_2CO_3$).\n\nThe buffering capacity of the system depends on the influx of the buffer base ($\\text{HCO}_3^-$) from the bulk fluid. The flux of bicarbonate is given by $J_{\\text{HCO}_3^-} = -D_{\\mathrm{eff}, \\text{HCO}_3^-} \\frac{dC_{\\text{HCO}_3^-}}{dx}$.\n\nThe problem states two key premises for comparison:\n1.  The local proton production rate density $r_H$ is similar in both reactors ($S$ and $G$) at a given depth.\n2.  The effective diffusivity is much lower in the sucrose-grown biofilm: $D_{\\mathrm{eff},S} \\ll D_{\\mathrm{eff},G}$. This applies to all small solutes, including $H^+$ and $\\text{HCO}_3^-$.\n\n**Analysis of Minimum Interfacial pH:**\n\nIn Reactor $S$ (sucrose), the effective diffusivity $D_{\\mathrm{eff},S}$ is very low. This has two major consequences:\n1.  **Slow Acid Efflux**: The protons ($H^+$) produced by the bacteria via glycolysis are unable to diffuse out of the biofilm and into the bulk fluid quickly. They become \"trapped\" within the biofilm matrix near their site of production.\n2.  **Slow Buffer Influx**: The bicarbonate buffer ($HCO_3^-$) from the bulk saliva analog is unable to diffuse into the biofilm quickly to neutralize the accumulating acid.\n\nThe combination of a similar production rate $r_H$ and severely restricted transport means that the local concentration of protons, $C_{H^+}$, at the enamel interface ($x=0$) will build up to a much higher level in Reactor $S$ compared to Reactor $G$.\n\nIn Reactor $G$ (glucose), the effective diffusivity $D_{\\mathrm{eff},G}$ is significantly higher. Therefore, protons can diffuse out more readily, and bicarbonate can diffuse in more readily. The acid is more effectively cleared and neutralized, leading to a smaller accumulation of $H^+$ at the enamel interface.\n\nSince $pH = -\\log_{10}(C_{H^+})$, a higher proton concentration $C_{H^+}$ corresponds to a lower pH. Thus, we predict that the minimum pH achieved at the enamel interface will be lower in Reactor $S$ than in Reactor $G$.\n$$ (pH_{\\text{min}})_S < (pH_{\\text{min}})_G $$\n\n**Analysis of Lesion Depth:**\n\nThe problem states that the extent of demineralization scales with the time-integral of undersaturation below the critical pH (given as $\\approx 5.5$). Undersaturation with respect to hydroxyapatite is a direct function of pH; the lower the pH, the greater the undersaturation and the faster the rate of mineral dissolution.\n\nBased on our pH analysis:\n1.  **Rate of Demineralization**: Since Reactor $S$ reaches a lower minimum pH, it will experience a higher degree of undersaturation during the carbohydrate pulses. This leads to a faster intrinsic rate of demineralization at the enamel interface compared to Reactor $G$.\n2.  **Duration of Demineralization**: The slow diffusion in an S-biofilm also means that after the carbohydrate pulse ends and acid production ceases, the clearance of the accumulated acid will be much slower than in a G-biofilm. This prolongs the period during which the interfacial pH remains below the critical value of $5.5$.\n\nTherefore, Reactor $S$ experiences both a greater magnitude of pH drop (higher rate of demineralization) and a longer duration of acidic conditions for each pulse. The time-integral of undersaturation will be significantly larger for Reactor $S$.\n$$ \\int (\\text{Undersaturation}) \\, dt \\bigg|_S > \\int (\\text{Undersaturation}) \\, dt \\bigg|_G $$\nThis leads to a greater extent of demineralization, and thus a greater lesion depth in Reactor $S$.\n\n**Conclusion**: Reactor $S$ is predicted to have a lower minimum interfacial pH and a greater lesion depth than Reactor $G$.\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Reactor $S$ reaches a lower minimum pH at the enamel interface and develops a greater lesion depth than Reactor $G$.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivation. The low diffusivity ($D_{\\mathrm{eff},S}$) in the sucrose-grown biofilm traps acid at the enamel interface, causing a more severe and prolonged pH drop, which in turn drives greater demineralization.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Reactor $S$ reaches a lower minimum pH at the enamel interface but develops a smaller lesion depth than Reactor $G$ because the denser EPS matrix impedes acid from reaching enamel.**\nThe first part of the statement is correct. However, the second part and its reasoning are flawed. The acid is produced by bacteria *within* the biofilm, many of which are at the enamel interface. The dense EPS matrix does not act as a barrier protecting the enamel; it acts as a cage, trapping the acid produced locally *against* the enamel, thereby exacerbating demineralization.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Reactor $G$ reaches a lower minimum pH at the enamel interface and develops a greater lesion depth than Reactor $S$ because glucose is taken up faster, while the EPS in Reactor $S$ dilutes acids.**\nThis is incorrect on multiple counts. Reactor $G$, with its higher diffusivity, will have better acid clearance and thus a *higher* minimum pH. The problem provides no basis to assume glucose is taken up faster; in fact, it states glycolytic capacity is comparable. The claim that EPS \"dilutes acids\" is physically incorrect; by impeding transport, it locally *concentrates* them.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Both reactors reach similar minimum interfacial pH values because acidogenicity per biomass is the same; lesion depths are also similar because demineralization is reaction-limited rather than transport-limited.**\nThis option incorrectly dismisses the role of mass transport. Even if the intrinsic rate of acid production per cell ($r_H$) is the same, the resulting pH is determined by the balance of production and transport. The problem explicitly gives $D_{\\mathrm{eff},S} \\ll D_{\\mathrm{eff},G}$, making it impossible for the interfacial pH values to be similar. This difference in transport properties is the central feature of the problem, so arguing the system is purely reaction-limited is a direct contradiction of the premises.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Reactor $S$ reaches a similar minimum interfacial pH as Reactor $G$ but develops a greater lesion depth because EPS stores chelators that drive demineralization independent of pH.**\nThis option incorrectly claims similar interfacial pH values, ignoring the given diffusion differences. Furthermore, it introduces a mechanism of chelation that is not mentioned in the problem premises. The solution must be derived *only* from the provided information, which points to an acid-mediated, pH-dependent process.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4717198"}, {"introduction": "The acidic microenvironments created by a mature biofilm do more than just dissolve enamel; they also act as a powerful selective pressure on the microbial community itself.

Based on the principle of fitness-proportional allocation, we can write:\n$$x_{m}^{*} \\propto f_{m}(pH)$$\n$$x_{s}^{*} \\propto f_{s}(pH)$$\nWe can introduce a single normalization constant, $k$, to convert these proportionalities into equalities:\n$$x_{m}^{*} = k \\cdot f_{m}(pH)$$\n$$x_{s}^{*} = k \\cdot f_{s}(pH)$$\nThe constraint that the total fraction is $1$ provides the equation needed to determine $k$:\n$$x_{m}^{*} + x_{s}^{*} = 1$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the steady-state fractions into this sum:\n$$k \\cdot f_{m}(pH) + k \\cdot f_{s}(pH) = 1$$\nFactoring out the constant $k$:\n$$k \\left( f_{m}(pH) + f_{s}(pH) \\right) = 1$$\nSolving for $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{1}{f_{m}(pH) + f_{s}(pH)}$$\nFinally, substituting this expression for $k$ back into the equation for $x_{m}^{*}$ gives the required analytic function for the steady-state fraction of *S. mutans* as a function of the fitness of both species:\n$$x_{m}^{*}(pH) = \\frac{f_{m}(pH)}{f_{m}(pH) + f_{s}(pH)}$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nThe second part requires the numerical calculation of $x_{m}^{*}$ at the new environmental condition of $pH = 5.50$. The fitness functions are given as:\n$$f_{m}(pH) \\;=\\; \\lambda_{m}\\,\\exp\\!\\big(-\\gamma_{m}\\,(pH-\\theta_{m})^{2}\\big)$$\n$$f_{s}(pH) \\;=\\; \\lambda_{s}\\,\\exp\\!\\big(-\\gamma_{s}\\,(pH-\\theta_{s})^{2}\\big)$$\nThe provided parameters are:\nFor *S. mutans* ($m$): $\\lambda_{m} = 0.65$, $\\gamma_{m} = 0.60$, and $\\theta_{m} = 5.20$.\nFor *S. sanguinis* ($s$): $\\lambda_{s} = 0.55$, $\\gamma_{s} = 0.25$, and $\\theta_{s} = 6.80$.\n\nWe evaluate each fitness function at $pH = 5.50$.\nFor *S. mutans*:\n$$f_{m}(5.50) = 0.65 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-0.60 \\cdot (5.50 - 5.20)^{2}\\right)$$\n$$f_{m}(5.50) = 0.65 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-0.60 \\cdot (0.30)^{2}\\right)$$\n$$f_{m}(5.50) = 0.65 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-0.60 \\cdot 0.09\\right)$$\n$$f_{m}(5.50) = 0.65 \\cdot \\exp(-0.054)$$\nFor *S. sanguinis*:\n$$f_{s}(5.50) = 0.55 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-0.25 \\cdot (5.50 - 6.80)^{2}\\right)$$\n$$f_{s}(5.50) = 0.55 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-0.25 \\cdot (-1.30)^{2}\\right)$$\n$$f_{s}(5.50) = 0.55 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-0.25 \\cdot 1.69\\right)$$\n$$f_{s}(5.50) = 0.55 \\cdot \\exp(-0.4225)$$\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the formula for $x_{m}^{*}$:\n$$x_{m}^{*}(5.50) = \\frac{0.65 \\cdot \\exp(-0.054)}{0.65 \\cdot \\exp(-0.054) + 0.55 \\cdot \\exp(-0.4225)}$$\nTo obtain a numerical value, we compute the exponentials:\n$$\\exp(-0.054) \\approx 0.9474261$$\n$$\\exp(-0.4225) \\approx 0.6554038$$\nSubstituting these numerical values:\n$$f_{m}(5.50) \\approx 0.65 \\times 0.9474261 = 0.6158270$$\n$$f_{s}(5.50) \\approx 0.55 \\times 0.6554038 = 0.3604721$$\nFinally, we compute the fraction $x_{m}^{*}$:\n$$x_{m}^{*} \\approx \\frac{0.6158270}{0.6158270 + 0.3604721} = \\frac{0.6158270}{0.9762991} \\approx 0.6307843$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested, we obtain $0.6308$. This dimensionless fraction represents the new steady-state abundance of *S. mutans* after the environmental $pH$ has decreased to $5.50$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6308}$$", "id": "4717200"}]}
