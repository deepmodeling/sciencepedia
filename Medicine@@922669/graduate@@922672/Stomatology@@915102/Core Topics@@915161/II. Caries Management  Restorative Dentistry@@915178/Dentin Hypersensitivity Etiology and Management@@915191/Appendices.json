A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts as requested: the derivation of the osmotic pressure equation, the numerical evaluation of the osmotic pressure for the given conditions, and a mechanistic explanation of the pain response.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the van 't Hoff Equation for Osmotic Pressure**\n\nThe osmotic pressure, $\\Pi$, is the excess pressure that must be applied to a solution to prevent the inward flow of a pure solvent across a semipermeable membrane. At equilibrium, the chemical potential of the solvent, $\\mu_{\\text{solvent}}$, must be equal on both sides of the membrane.\n\nLet side $\\alpha$ contain the pure solvent (pulpal fluid, approximated as pure water) at pressure $P$, and side $\\beta$ contain the solution (external sucrose solution) at pressure $P+\\Pi$. The condition for equilibrium is:\n$$ \\mu_{\\alpha}(\\text{solvent}, P, T) = \\mu_{\\beta}(\\text{solvent}, P+\\Pi, T) $$\nThe chemical potential of the solvent in the solution (side $\\beta$) is related to the chemical potential of the pure solvent at the same pressure by:\n$$ \\mu_{\\beta}(\\text{solvent}, P+\\Pi, T) = \\mu_{\\text{pure solvent}}^{*}(P+\\Pi, T) + RT \\ln(x_{\\text{solvent}}) $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $x_{\\text{solvent}}$ is the mole fraction of the solvent in the solution.\n\nAt equilibrium, we have:\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{pure solvent}}^{*}(P, T) = \\mu_{\\text{pure solvent}}^{*}(P+\\Pi, T) + RT \\ln(x_{\\text{solvent}}) $$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{pure solvent}}^{*}(P+\\Pi, T) - \\mu_{\\text{pure solvent}}^{*}(P, T) = -RT \\ln(x_{\\text{solvent}}) $$\nThe dependence of chemical potential on pressure at constant temperature is given by the thermodynamic relation $(\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial P})_T = V_m$, where $V_m$ is the molar volume of the substance (the solvent, in this case). Integrating this from pressure $P$ to $P+\\Pi$ yields:\n$$ \\int_{P}^{P+\\Pi} V_m dP' = \\mu_{\\text{pure solvent}}^{*}(P+\\Pi, T) - \\mu_{\\text{pure solvent}}^{*}(P, T) $$\nAssuming the solvent is incompressible (a valid approximation for liquids like water under these pressures), $V_m$ is constant. The integral becomes:\n$$ V_m \\Pi = \\mu_{\\text{pure solvent}}^{*}(P+\\Pi, T) - \\mu_{\\text{pure solvent}}^{*}(P, T) $$\nSubstituting this back into the equilibrium relation gives:\n$$ V_m \\Pi = -RT \\ln(x_{\\text{solvent}}) $$\nThe mole fraction of the solvent is $x_{\\text{solvent}} = 1 - x_{\\text{solute}}$, where $x_{\\text{solute}}$ is the mole fraction of the solute. For a dilute solution, $x_{\\text{solute}} \\ll 1$. We can use the Taylor series expansion for the natural logarithm, $\\ln(1 - z) \\approx -z$ for small $z$. Therefore:\n$$ \\ln(x_{\\text{solvent}}) = \\ln(1 - x_{\\text{solute}}) \\approx -x_{\\text{solute}} $$\nThe equation for osmotic pressure simplifies to:\n$$ V_m \\Pi \\approx RT x_{\\text{solute}} $$\nNext, we express the solute mole fraction, $x_{\\text{solute}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{solute}}}{n_{\\text{solute}} + n_{\\text{solvent}}}$, in terms of molar concentration, $C = \\frac{n_{\\text{solute}}}{V}$, where $V$ is the total volume of the solution. For a dilute solution, $n_{\\text{solute}} \\ll n_{\\text{solvent}}$, so $x_{\\text{solute}} \\approx \\frac{n_{\\text{solute}}}{n_{\\text{solvent}}}$. Also, the total volume of the solution is approximately the volume of the solvent, $V \\approx n_{\\text{solvent}} V_m$.\nSubstituting these approximations:\n$$ x_{\\text{solute}} \\approx \\frac{n_{\\text{solute}}}{V/V_m} = \\left(\\frac{n_{\\text{solute}}}{V}\\right)V_m = CV_m $$\nFinally, substituting this expression for $x_{\\text{solute}}$ into the osmotic pressure equation:\n$$ V_m \\Pi \\approx RT (CV_m) $$\n$$ \\Pi \\approx CRT $$\nThis expression is valid for non-dissociating solutes. To account for solutes that dissociate into multiple particles (ions), we introduce the dimensionless van 't Hoff factor, $i$, which is the number of moles of particles produced per mole of solute dissolved. The final, generalized form of the van 't Hoff equation is:\n$$ \\Pi = iCRT $$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation of Osmotic Pressure**\n\nWe are asked to calculate the osmotic pressure for a sucrose solution with the following parameters:\n- van 't Hoff factor, $i = 1$ (sucrose does not dissociate in water)\n- Molar concentration, $C = 1\\,\\mathrm{M} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$\n- Universal gas constant, $R = 0.0831\\,\\mathrm{L}\\cdot\\mathrm{bar}/(\\mathrm{mol}\\cdot\\mathrm{K})$\n- Absolute temperature, $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$ \\Pi = (1) \\times \\left(1\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}}\\right) \\times \\left(0.0831\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{L}\\cdot\\mathrm{bar}}{\\mathrm{mol}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}}\\right) \\times (310\\,\\mathrm{K}) $$\n$$ \\Pi = 1 \\times 1 \\times 0.0831 \\times 310\\,\\mathrm{bar} $$\n$$ \\Pi = 25.761\\,\\mathrm{bar} $$\nRounding the final answer to three significant figures as required:\n$$ \\Pi \\approx 25.8\\,\\mathrm{bar} $$\n\n**Part 3: Mechanistic Explanation of Pain Elicitation**\n\nThe elicitation of pain from a hypertonic sucrose solution, as described by the hydrodynamic theory, proceeds through a sequence of biophysical and physiological events:\n\n1.  **Establishment of an Osmotic Gradient**: When the hypertonic sucrose solution comes into contact with exposed dentin, an osmotic gradient is created across the fluid-filled dentinal tubules. The external solution has a high solute concentration (e.g., $1\\,\\mathrm{M}$ sucrose) and therefore a very low water potential. The fluid inside the dentinal tubules and pulp is isotonic with body fluids, having a much lower solute concentration and higher water potential.\n\n2.  **Hydrodynamic Fluid Flow**: As derived, the osmotic gradient generates a substantial osmotic pressure (calculated as approximately $25.8\\,\\mathrm{bar}$ or about $25.5$ atmospheres). This pressure difference drives a rapid outward flow of fluid from the pulpal tissue, through the dentinal tubules, towards the external environment. This phenomenon is the \"hydrodynamics\" central to the theory.\n\n3.  **Mechanical Deformation of Odontoblasts**: The odontoblast cells reside at the pulp-dentin border and have long cytoplasmic processes extending into the dentinal tubules. The rapid outward flux of tubular fluid exerts a viscous drag or shear force on these odontoblast processes. This force mechanically deforms the cell membrane of the odontoblast and any associated nerve endings.\n\n4.  **Activation of Mechanosensitive Nociceptors**: The membranes of the odontoblast processes and the afferent $A\\delta$ nerve fibers they are coupled with contain mechanosensitive ion channels, including members of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) family (e.g., TRPV4, TRPA1). The mechanical strain induced by the fluid flow causes these channels to open.\n\n5.  **Nerve Depolarization and Signal Transduction**: The opening of these non-selective cation channels allows an influx of ions (primarily $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$) into the nerve ending. This influx depolarizes the nerve membrane. If the depolarization reaches the threshold potential, it triggers the firing of an action potential.\n\n6.  **Pain Perception**: The action potential propagates along the trigeminal nerve pathway to the central nervous system (trigeminal nucleus, thalamus, and somatosensory cortex), where the signal is processed and perceived as the characteristic sharp, transient pain of dentin hypersensitivity. The transient nature of the pain corresponds to the rapid fluid shift, which subsides as the stimulus is removed or the gradient dissipates.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{25.8} $$", "id": "4710736"}, {"introduction": "Once a stimulus creates a pressure differential, the core of the hydrodynamic theory lies in the resulting fluid movement through dentinal tubules.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the volumetric flow rate through a cylindrical tubule and subsequent calculation of a dimensionless index.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Volumetric Flow Rate $Q$**\n\nWe begin with the Navier–Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates $(R, \\phi, z)$. The flow is assumed to be steady ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$), fully developed ($\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0$), axisymmetric ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} = 0$), and unidirectional along the $z$-axis. The velocity vector is therefore $\\mathbf{v} = v_z(R)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, which means the radial ($v_R$) and azimuthal ($v_\\phi$) velocity components are zero.\n\nThe continuity equation for an incompressible fluid is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0$. In cylindrical coordinates, this is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{R}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial R}(R v_R) + \\frac{1}{R}\\frac{\\partial v_\\phi}{\\partial \\phi} + \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\nWith $v_R = 0$ and $v_\\phi = 0$, this simplifies to $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0$, which is consistent with the fully developed flow assumption.\n\nNext, we consider the momentum equation. Due to the assumptions, the convective acceleration term, $(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{v}$, is identically zero. The $z$-component of the steady Navier-Stokes equation simplifies greatly. Neglecting gravitational body forces, we have:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} + \\mu \\left( \\frac{1}{R}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial R}\\left(R \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial R}\\right) + \\frac{1}{R^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial \\phi^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial z^2} \\right) $$\nApplying the assumptions that $v_z$ is a function of $R$ only, the terms $\\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial \\phi^2}$ and $\\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial z^2}$ are zero. The equation becomes an ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dz} = \\frac{\\mu}{R}\\frac{d}{dR}\\left(R \\frac{dv_z}{dR}\\right) $$\nThe left side can only be a function of $z$ and the right side only a function of $R$. For this equality to hold, both sides must be equal to a constant. The pressure gradient is constant along the tubule length $L$. We can write this constant as $\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$, where $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop from the inlet to the outlet.\n$$ \\frac{\\mu}{R}\\frac{d}{dR}\\left(R \\frac{dv_z}{dR}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{L} $$\nRearranging and integrating with respect to $R$:\n$$ R \\frac{dv_z}{dR} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\mu L} R^2 + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. For the velocity gradient $\\frac{dv_z}{dR}$ to be finite at the centerline of the tubule ($R=0$), we must have $C_1=0$.\n$$ \\frac{dv_z}{dR} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\mu L} R $$\nIntegrating again with respect to $R$:\n$$ v_z(R) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} R^2 + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second integration constant. We apply the no-slip boundary condition at the tubule wall, $v_z(R=r) = 0$:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} r^2 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{\\Delta P r^2}{4\\mu L} $$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back gives the parabolic velocity profile, characteristic of Hagen-Poiseuille flow:\n$$ v_z(R) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} (r^2 - R^2) $$\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is obtained by integrating the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area $A$ of the tubule:\n$$ Q = \\int_A v_z(R) dA = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^r v_z(R) R \\,dR \\,d\\phi $$\nSince the integrand is independent of $\\phi$, the integration over $\\phi$ yields a factor of $2\\pi$:\n$$ Q = 2\\pi \\int_0^r \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} (r^2 - R^2) R \\,dR $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\int_0^r (r^2 R - R^3) \\,dR $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left[ \\frac{r^2 R^2}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right]_0^r = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{r^4}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right) $$\nThis yields the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L} $$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of $Q$**\n\nWe are given the following values.

The initial potential $E_{K,1}$ is approximately $-95\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, while the final potential $E_{K,2}$ is approximately $-52\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Since the resting membrane potential of the pulpal afferent fiber is dominated by $E_K$, the resting potential also depolarizes, becoming significantly less negative.\n\nThis depolarization is the key to the therapeutic effect. While a transient depolarization normally moves a neuron closer to its firing threshold, making it more excitable, a *sustained* depolarization has the opposite effect. The prolonged elevation of the resting potential inactivates the voltage-gated sodium channels that are necessary for the rapid upstroke of an action potential. With these channels inactivated, the neuron cannot fire an action potential, even if a stimulus (like fluid movement in dentinal tubules) provides a further depolarizing trigger. This state of reduced excitability due to sustained depolarization is known as accommodation. Consequently, the transmission of pain signals from the pulp is blocked, leading to the desensitizing effect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{43.0}$$", "id": "4710755"}]}
