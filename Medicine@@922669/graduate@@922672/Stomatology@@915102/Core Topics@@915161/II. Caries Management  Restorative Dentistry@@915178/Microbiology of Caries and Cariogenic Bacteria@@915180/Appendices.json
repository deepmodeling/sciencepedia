Consider a single Streptococcus mutans cell in homolactic fermentation, where glucose is converted through the Embden–Meyerhof pathway to lactic acid with reoxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ($\\mathrm{NADH}$) by lactate dehydrogenase.

This process occurs in two phases: an energy investment phase and an energy payoff phase.\n    *   **Energy Investment Phase**: Two steps in this phase consume ATP. First, glucose is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate. Second, fructose-6-phosphate is phosphorylated to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Each of these reactions hydrolyzes one molecule of ATP. Thus, for each mole of glucose entering the pathway, $2$ moles of ATP are consumed.\n        $$\n        \\text{Glucose} + 2 \\, \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate} + 2 \\, \\text{ADP} + 2 \\, \\mathrm{H}^{+}\n        $$\n    *   **Energy Payoff Phase**: The fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (a $6$-carbon molecule) is cleaved into two $3$-carbon molecules. Each of these molecules proceeds through the remainder of the pathway to pyruvate. In this phase, there are two substrate-level phosphorylation steps that generate ATP. For each $3$-carbon molecule, one ATP is generated from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and another from phosphoenolpyruvate. Since one molecule of glucose yields two $3$-carbon intermediates, a total of $2 \\times 2 = 4$ moles of ATP are generated per mole of glucose.\n        $$\n        \\text{Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate} \\rightarrow 2 \\, \\text{Pyruvate} + 4 \\, \\text{ATP} + 2 \\, \\mathrm{NADH}\n        $$\n2.  **Net ATP from Glycolysis**: The net ATP yield from glycolysis is the total ATP produced minus the total ATP invested.\n    $$\n    N_{\\mathrm{ATP, gross}} = (\\text{ATP generated}) - (\\text{ATP invested}) = 4 \\, \\text{mol} - 2 \\, \\text{mol} = 2 \\, \\text{mol}\n    $$\n    Therefore, the net yield from glycolysis is $2$ moles of ATP per mole of glucose.\n\n3.  **Fermentation Step**: In homolactic fermentation, the two molecules of pyruvate generated from glycolysis are reduced to two molecules of lactate. This reaction, catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase, serves to reoxidize the $2$ moles of $\\mathrm{NADH}$ produced during glycolysis back to $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$.\n    $$\n    2 \\, \\text{Pyruvate} + 2 \\, \\mathrm{NADH} + 2 \\, \\mathrm{H}^{+} \\rightarrow 2 \\, \\text{Lactate} + 2 \\, \\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\n    $$\n    This step does not involve any ATP synthesis or consumption. Its purpose is to regenerate the $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ required for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction in glycolysis, allowing ATP production to continue under anaerobic conditions.\n\nThe gross net ATP yield per mole of glucose for homolactic fermentation is therefore $2$ moles of ATP.\n\n**Part 2: Net ATP Available after Pumping Costs**\n\nTo maintain a cytoplasmic $pH$ of $pH_{\\text{in}} = 7.2$ against an external $pH$ of $pH_{\\text{out}} = 4.2$, the cell must actively pump out protons.

The functional consequences are an increase in the biofilm matrix, which limits diffusion, and enhanced adherence.\n2.  **$atpD$**: This gene encodes a subunit of the proton-translocating $F_{1}F_{0}$-ATPase. This enzyme's function is to maintain intracellular $pH$ ($pH_i$) homeostasis by actively expelling protons ($H^+$) from the cytoplasm. This process consumes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and is crucial for allowing glycolysis to proceed under conditions of low extracellular $pH$ ($pH_e$). A direct consequence is an increase in the extracellular proton concentration.\n3.  **Biofilm EPS and pH**: The EPS matrix traps metabolites, including organic acids, and impedes the ingress of buffering agents. This leads to the formation of localized, steep $pH$ gradients, with significant $pH$ depressions at the biofilm-enamel interface.\n4.  **Critical pH**: Enamel demineralization is initiated when the $pH$ drops below a critical value, stated to be approximately $5.5$.\n\nWe will now integrate these facts to understand the phenotype of the acid-acclimated bacteria.\n\n**Analysis of the Adaptive Response:**\nThe pre-acclimation at a moderately low $pH$ of $5.0$ induces an acid tolerance response (ATR) in the streptococcus. The observed transcriptional changes are hallmarks of this response.\n\n-   **Upregulation of $atpD$ ($+3.7\\times$):** This is the most strongly upregulated transcript. A higher abundance of $F_{1}F_{0}$-ATPase protein allows the cell to more effectively pump protons out of the cytoplasm. This is a critical survival mechanism in acidic environments. By maintaining a more neutral $pH_i$, the cell protects its acid-sensitive enzymes, particularly those of the glycolytic pathway. A consequence of maintaining high glycolytic flux is sustained, high-rate production of metabolic acids (e.g., lactic acid). The ATPase-mediated proton-pumping itself also directly contributes to the acidification of the immediate extracellular space. Therefore, upregulated $atpD$ signifies an enhanced ability to both survive in acid and continue producing acid.\n\n-   **Upregulation of $gtfB$ and $gtfC$ ($+2.3\\times$ and $+1.8\\times$):** The increased expression of GTF-encoding genes means that upon exposure to sucrose, the acid-acclimated cells will synthesize EPS glucans more rapidly and/or in greater quantity than their neutral-acclimated counterparts. According to the provided principles, this will result in a thicker, denser biofilm matrix. This matrix acts as a diffusion barrier, trapping the acids produced by glycolysis and proton pumping close to the enamel surface and preventing their neutralization or diffusion away.\n\n**Integrated Prediction:**\nWhen the acid-acclimated biofilm is pulsed with sucrose:\n1.  High glycolytic activity is sustained despite the low $pH_e$ because the upregulated $F_{1}F_{0}$-ATPase maintains a viable $pH_i$. This leads to a high rate of acid production.\n2.  The upregulated $F_{1}F_{0}$-ATPase actively pumps protons into the extracellular space, adding to the acid load.\n3.  The concurrently synthesized, denser EPS matrix traps these acids at the biofilm-enamel interface.\n4.  The combination of high acid production and efficient acid trapping will cause the localized $pH$ at the enamel surface to drop more rapidly, reach a lower minimum (a deeper $pH$ drop), and remain low for a longer duration compared to the conditions created by neutral-acclimated cells.\n5.  Consequently, the $pH$ is more likely to fall below the critical $pH$ of $5.5$ and stay there for a longer period, resulting in a significantly increased potential for enamel demineralization.\n\nThis phenotype, characterized by the ability to continue producing acid in an already acidic environment (acidogenicity in aciduric conditions), is a key virulence factor of cariogenic bacteria. The acid pre-acclimation has selected for and induced a more virulent, more cariogenic state.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. Upregulated $atpD$ will import extracellular protons, neutralizing the biofilm microenvironment; despite higher $gtfB/gtfC$, localized $pH$ at the enamel surface will rise above $pH\\,6.0$, decreasing demineralization risk relative to neutral-acclimated cells.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The $F_{1}F_{0}$-ATPase in this context is a proton *pump* that *expels* protons to maintain $pH_i$. It does not import them. Importing protons would be metabolically detrimental, acidifying the cytoplasm and halting glycolysis. The premise is incorrect, and thus the conclusion of a rising $pH$ and decreased risk is also incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Upregulated $atpD$ will enhance proton extrusion and maintain intracellular $pH$, sustaining high glycolytic flux and acid production at low extracellular $pH$; concomitant increases in $gtfB/gtfC$ will thicken the EPS matrix and slow diffusion, causing deeper and more prolonged $pH$ minima at the enamel interface that more frequently fall below $pH\\,5.5$, thereby increasing demineralization potential relative to neutral-acclimated cells.**\nThis option correctly integrates all the provided information. It accurately describes the function of upregulated $atpD$ (proton extrusion, maintenance of $pH_i$, sustained glycolysis), the function of upregulated $gtfB/gtfC$ (thicker EPS, diffusion limitation), and the combined effect on the biofilm microenvironment (deeper, prolonged $pH$ drop below the critical $pH$). The final conclusion of increased demineralization potential is the logical outcome of this integrated analysis. **Correct**.\n\n**C. Although $gtfB/gtfC$ increase EPS, the energetic cost of $F_{1}F_{0}$-ATPase activity driven by upregulated $atpD$ will divert ATP away from glycolysis, reducing acidogenesis overall; thus localized $pH$ will remain around $pH\\,6.2$, lowering enamel demineralization risk while marginally affecting dentin.**\nThis option presents a plausible but incorrect interpretation of the energetic trade-off. While the ATPase does consume ATP, its primary biological role in this context is to *enable* glycolysis to continue under acid stress. The overall strategy of the cell is to maintain acid production, not to shut it down to save energy. A reduction in overall acidogenesis is contrary to the known phenotype of acid-tolerant streptococci. The prediction of the $pH$ remaining around $6.2$ is unsubstantiated and contradicts the expected outcome of enhanced acid production and trapping. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Increased $gtfB/gtfC$ expression promotes direct proton binding by glucans, chemically neutralizing acids irrespective of $atpD$; the enamel-surface $pH$ will be buffered upward during sucrose pulses, reducing demineralization risk compared to neutral-acclimated cells.**\nThis statement misrepresents the primary role of EPS in cariogenesis. While biopolymers may have some slight buffering capacity, the dominant effect of the dense, water-insoluble glucan matrix is to act as a diffusion barrier that *traps* acid, not neutralize it. The idea that this would buffer the $pH$ *upward* and reduce demineralization risk is the opposite of its well-established pathological function. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4733980"}]}
