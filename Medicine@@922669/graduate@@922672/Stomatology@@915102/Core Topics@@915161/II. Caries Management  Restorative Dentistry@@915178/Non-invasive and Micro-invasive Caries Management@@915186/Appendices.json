The surface concentration is clamped at $C_{s}$ by an external acid reservoir, and the lesion-base concentration is clamped at $C_{b}$ by internal buffering. Under these boundary conditions the concentration gradient $\\partial C/\\partial x$ across the slab is time-invariant during each challenge.

The physical process is modeled as one-dimensional, quasi-steady-state diffusion through a slab of thickness $L$.\n\nThe governing equation for the diffusive flux, $J$, is given by Fick’s first law. For a one-dimensional system, this is:\n$$\nJ = -D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the effective diffusivity, $C$ is the concentration of lactic acid, and $x$ is the spatial coordinate perpendicular to the slab surface.\n\nThe problem states that the process occurs under quasi-steady conditions, which implies that the flux $J$ does not change with time or position within the lesion body. Therefore, the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$ can be written as a total derivative $\\frac{dC}{dx}$, and it must be constant throughout the slab for a given set of conditions (i.e., before or after infiltration). Let this constant gradient be $K$.\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dx} = K\n$$\nWe can integrate this differential equation with respect to $x$ to find the concentration profile $C(x)$:\n$$\nC(x) = Kx + A\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the constant of integration. We use the given boundary conditions to determine the constants $K$ and $A$. Let $x=0$ be the surface of the lesion and $x=L$ be the base of the lesion.\nThe boundary conditions are:\n$1$. At the surface, $x=0$, the concentration is clamped at $C_s$: $C(0) = C_s$.\n$2$. At the base, $x=L$, the concentration is clamped at $C_b$: $C(L) = C_b$.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition:\n$$\nC(0) = K(0) + A = C_s \\implies A = C_s\n$$\nSo the concentration profile is $C(x) = Kx + C_s$. Applying the second boundary condition:\n$$\nC(L) = KL + C_s = C_b\n$$\nSolving for the constant gradient $K$:\n$$\nK = \\frac{C_b - C_s}{L}\n$$\nThe concentration gradient is indeed constant, as required by the steady-state assumption. Now, we substitute this expression for the gradient back into Fick's first law to obtain an expression for the flux $J$:\n$$\nJ = -D \\left( \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right) = -D \\left( \\frac{C_b - C_s}{L} \\right) = D \\frac{C_s - C_b}{L}\n$$\nThis fundamental relationship connects the flux $J$ to the diffusivity $D$ and the constant parameters $C_s$, $C_b$, and $L$. Physically, acid diffuses from a region of higher concentration to lower concentration, so we assume $C_s > C_b$, which makes $J$ a positive quantity. The magnitude of the flux is therefore $|J| = J$.\n\nLet $J_{\\text{before}}$ and $D_{\\text{before}}$ be the flux and diffusivity before infiltration, and let $J_{\\text{after}}$ and $D_{\\text{after}}$ be the values after infiltration. The parameters $C_s$, $C_b$, and $L$ are stated to be identical in both scenarios.\nThe flux before infiltration is:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{before}} = D_{\\text{before}} \\frac{C_s - C_b}{L}\n$$\nThe flux after infiltration is:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{after}} = D_{\\text{after}} \\frac{C_s - C_b}{L}\n$$\nThe fractional change in the magnitude of the acid flux, $f$, is defined as:\n$$\nf = \\frac{|J_{\\text{after}}| - |J_{\\text{before}}|}{|J_{\\text{before}}|}\n$$\nSince $C_s > C_b$, both $J_{\\text{before}}$ and $J_{\\text{after}}$ are positive, so we can remove the absolute value signs:\n$$\nf = \\frac{J_{\\text{after}} - J_{\\text{before}}}{J_{\\text{before}}} = \\frac{J_{\\text{after}}}{J_{\\text{before}}} - 1\n$$\nWe now substitute the expressions for $J_{\\text{before}}$ and $J_{\\text{after}}$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{D_{\\text{after}} \\frac{C_s - C_b}{L}}{D_{\\text{before}} \\frac{C_s - C_b}{L}} - 1\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{C_s - C_b}{L}$, representing the driving force scaled by the lesion thickness, is constant and non-zero. It cancels from the numerator and the denominator, yielding a simple relationship between the fractional change in flux and the diffusivities:\n$$\nf = \\frac{D_{\\text{after}}}{D_{\\text{before}}} - 1\n$$\nThe problem states that the effective diffusivity decreases by $80\\%$ after infiltration. This translates to the following mathematical relationship:\n$$\nD_{\\text{after}} = D_{\\text{before}} - 0.80 \\times D_{\\text{before}} = (1 - 0.80) D_{\\text{before}} = 0.20 D_{\\text{before}}\n$$\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the diffusivities:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{\\text{after}}}{D_{\\text{before}}} = 0.20\n$$\nSubstituting this ratio into the expression for $f$:\n$$\nf = 0.20 - 1 = -0.80\n$$\nThe fractional change in flux is $-0.80$.

The solution proceeds in two parts: first, a derivation of the time required for infiltration, and second, a numerical evaluation using the given parameters.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Infiltration Time\n\nThe infiltration of the resin into the porous enamel is driven by capillary action and resisted by viscous forces. We model a single pore as a straight cylindrical tube of radius $r$.\n\nThe driving force is the capillary pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{cap}}$, which arises from the surface tension of the liquid at the meniscus. For a cylindrical tube, this pressure is given by the Young-Laplace equation, simplified for this geometry:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{\\text{cap}} = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r}\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the surface tension of the infiltrant, $\\theta$ is the contact angle with the pore wall, and $r$ is the pore radius. Since $\\gamma$, $\\theta$, and $r$ are assumed to be constant, a constant pressure drives the flow.\n\nThe flow is resisted by viscous drag. For laminar, quasi-steady flow in a cylindrical tube, the relationship between the volumetric flow rate $Q$ and the pressure drop over a length $x$ of the fluid column, $\\Delta P_{\\text{visc}}$, is described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{8\\eta x} \\Delta P_{\\text-visc}\n$$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the infiltrant.\n\nThe quasi-steady state assumption implies that at any instant, the driving capillary pressure is balanced by the viscous pressure drop over the current length of the fluid column, $x(t)$. Therefore, we set $\\Delta P_{\\text{visc}} = \\Delta P_{\\text{cap}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{\\text{visc}} = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation gives:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{8\\eta x} \\left(\\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi r^3 \\gamma \\cos\\theta}{4\\eta x}\n$$\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ can also be expressed in terms of the velocity of the liquid-air interface, $v = \\frac{dx}{dt}$. The volume of the fluid in the pore is $V = \\pi r^2 x$. The flow rate is the rate of change of this volume:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\pi r^2 x) = \\pi r^2 \\frac{dx}{dt}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $Q$:\n$$\n\\pi r^2 \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{\\pi r^3 \\gamma \\cos\\theta}{4\\eta x}\n$$\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing by $\\pi r^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{r \\gamma \\cos\\theta}{4\\eta x}\n$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation that describes the motion of the liquid front. To find the time $t$ required to reach a depth $L$, we separate the variables and integrate. We integrate the position $x$ from $0$ to $L$ and the time $t$ from $0$ to $t$:\n$$\nx \\, dx = \\left(\\frac{r \\gamma \\cos\\theta}{4\\eta}\\right) dt\n$$\n$$\n\\int_0^L x \\, dx = \\int_0^t \\frac{r \\gamma \\cos\\theta}{4\\eta} \\, dt\n$$\nSince the term in the parentheses on the right-hand side is constant with respect to time, the integration is straightforward:\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_0^L = \\left(\\frac{r \\gamma \\cos\\theta}{4\\eta}\\right) [t]_0^t\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{L^2}{2} - 0 = \\left(\\frac{r \\gamma \\cos\\theta}{4\\eta}\\right) (t - 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{L^2}{2} = \\frac{r \\gamma \\cos\\theta}{4\\eta} t\n$$\nFinally, solving for the time $t$ gives the desired expression:\n$$\nt = \\frac{L^2}{2} \\left(\\frac{4\\eta}{r \\gamma \\cos\\theta}\\right) = \\frac{2 L^2 \\eta}{r \\gamma \\cos\\theta}\n$$\nThis result is a specific form of the Washburn equation.\n\nPart 2: Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are given the following values.
