Based on the provided information, we only need to consider the intake from community water, $M_{water}$, and from dentifrice, $M_{dentifrice}$, as other sources are negligible.\n\n$$\nM_{total} = M_{water} + M_{dentifrice}\n$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the daily intake from water, $M_{water}$. The problem defines intake from a continuous source as the time integral of the mass flow rate. The mass flow rate, $\\dot{m}(t)$, is the product of the concentration, $C_{water}$, and the volumetric flow rate, $q_{water}(t)$. The total mass ingested over a period of one day ($T=1$ day) is:\n\n$$\nM_{water} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\dot{m}(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{T} C_{water} \\cdot q_{water}(t) \\, dt\n$$\n\nSince the concentration $C_{water}$ is constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n\n$$\nM_{water} = C_{water} \\int_{0}^{T} q_{water}(t) \\, dt\n$$\n\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{T} q_{water}(t) \\, dt$ represents the total volume of water ingested in one day, which is given as $V_{water} = 2$ L.\nThus, the mass of fluoride from water is:\n\n$$\nM_{water} = C_{water} \\cdot V_{water}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$C_{water} = 0.7$ $\\mathrm{mg/L}$\n$V_{water} = 2$ $\\mathrm{L}$\n\n$$\nM_{water} = (0.7 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}}) \\times (2 \\, \\mathrm{L}) = 1.4 \\, \\mathrm{mg}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the daily intake from dentifrice, $M_{dentifrice}$. This intake occurs as discrete events. The total daily intake from this source is the product of the mass of fluoride swallowed per event, $m_{event}$, and the number of events per day, $n_{events}$.\n\n$$\nM_{dentifrice} = m_{event} \\times n_{events}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$m_{event} = 0.25$ $\\mathrm{mg/event}$\n$n_{events} = 2$ events/day\n\n$$\nM_{dentifrice} = (0.25 \\, \\mathrm{mg}) \\times 2 = 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{mg}\n$$\n\nFinally, we sum the intakes from both sources to find the total daily fluoride intake, $M_{total}$:\n\n$$\nM_{total} = M_{water} + M_{dentifrice} = 1.4 \\, \\mathrm{mg} + 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{mg} = 1.9 \\, \\mathrm{mg}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be expressed to three significant figures.

Let's denote the two conditions with subscripts $1$ and $2$:\nCondition $1$: urine $\\mathrm{pH}_{u1} = 5.0$\nCondition $2$: urine $\\mathrm{pH}_{u2} = 7.5$\n\nThe ratio $R$ is the ratio of the fractional excretions under these two conditions:\n$$\nR = \\frac{FE_{F,1}}{FE_{F,2}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{V}{GFR}\\right) \\frac{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH}_{u1} - \\mathrm{p}K_a}}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH}_p - \\mathrm{p}K_a}}}{\\left(\\frac{V}{GFR}\\right) \\frac{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH}_{u2} - \\mathrm{p}K_a}}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH}_p - \\mathrm{p}K_a}}}\n$$\nThe terms related to water handling ($V/GFR$) and plasma $\\mathrm{pH}$ ($1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH}_p - \\mathrm{p}K_a}$) are identical in the numerator and denominator, and thus cancel out. The derived expression for $R$ is:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH}_{u1} - \\mathrm{p}K_a}}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH}_{u2} - \\mathrm{p}K_a}}\n$$\nNow we compute the numerical value using the given data: $\\mathrm{p}K_a = 3.17$, $\\mathrm{pH}_{u1} = 5.0$, and $\\mathrm{pH}_{u2} = 7.5$. The plasma $\\mathrm{pH}$ of $7.40$ is not needed for the final calculation.\n\nFor the numerator (urine $\\mathrm{pH} = 5.0$):\nThe exponent is $\\mathrm{pH}_{u1} - \\mathrm{p}K_a = 5.0 - 3.17 = 1.83$.\nThe numerator is $1 + 10^{1.83}$.\n\nFor the denominator (urine $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.5$):\nThe exponent is $\\mathrm{pH}_{u2} - \\mathrm{p}K_a = 7.5 - 3.17 = 4.33$.\nThe denominator is $1 + 10^{4.33}$.\n\nNow we calculate the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1 + 10^{1.83}}{1 + 10^{4.33}} = \\frac{1 + 67.608297...}{1 + 21379.6208...} = \\frac{68.608297...}{21380.6208...} \\approx 0.00320888\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives $0.00321$. This value being much less than $1$ is consistent with the principle of ion trapping: the more alkaline urine ($\\mathrm{pH} = 7.5$) traps a much larger fraction of fluoride in its non-reabsorbable ionized form ($\\mathrm{F}^{-}$), leading to a significantly higher fractional excretion compared to the more acidic urine ($\\mathrm{pH} = 5.0$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.00321}$$", "id": "4719404"}]}
