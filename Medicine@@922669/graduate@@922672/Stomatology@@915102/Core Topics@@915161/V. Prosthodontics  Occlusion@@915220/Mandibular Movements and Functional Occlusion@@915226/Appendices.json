Mastering this basic calculation [@problem_id:4731801] is the first step toward planning and evaluating changes to a patient's occlusion.", "problem": "A patient undergoing occlusal rehabilitation is assessed with two stable cutaneous reference points chosen on the maxillary and mandibular faces for vertical dimension measurement. The Rest Vertical Dimension (RVD) is defined as the distance between these points when the mandible is in the physiologic rest position governed by tonic masticatory muscle equilibrium and gravitational balance; the Occlusal Vertical Dimension (OVD) is the corresponding distance with the mandible in maximal intercuspal contact. The interocclusal rest space (freeway space) is the clearance between opposing teeth at the physiologic rest position, measured along the same vertical line that defines these dimensions.\n\nAssume the following conditions consistent with neuromuscularly intact function: the physiologic rest position, and thus the RVD, is unaffected by a modest increase in occlusal support (no change in gonial angle posture or tongue-lip mandibular positioning reflexes), and the selected reference points are rigid and reproducible. Initially, the patient has $RVD = 70\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $OVD = 66\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, both measured between the same reference points.

The freeway space ($FWS$), also known as the interocclusal rest space, is defined as the difference between the Rest Vertical Dimension ($RVD$) and the Occlusal Vertical Dimension ($OVD$). This relationship is fundamental to the problem.\n\nThe governing equation, derived from the definitions provided, is:\n$$FWS = RVD - OVD$$\n\nFirst, we identify the initial conditions as stated in the problem.\nThe initial Rest Vertical Dimension is given as $RVD_{initial} = 70\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\nThe initial Occlusal Vertical Dimension is given as $OVD_{initial} = 66\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nThe problem describes a prosthodontic intervention and its consequences on these dimensions. We must determine the final values for $RVD$ and $OVD$, which we will denote with the subscript 'final'.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the physiologic rest position is unaffected by the intervention, and thus the $RVD$ is maintained constant. This is a critical assumption for solving the problem. Therefore, the final Rest Vertical Dimension is equal to the initial value:\n$$RVD_{final} = RVD_{initial} = 70\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThe intervention explicitly consists of increasing the $OVD$ by $3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. We calculate the final Occlusal Vertical Dimension by adding this increase to the initial value:\n$$OVD_{final} = OVD_{initial} + 3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nSubstituting the given initial value for $OVD$:\n$$OVD_{final} = 66\\,\\mathrm{mm} + 3\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 69\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the new freeway space, $FWS_{final}$, by applying the fundamental governing equation to these final dimensional values:\n$$FWS_{final} = RVD_{final} - OVD_{final}$$\nSubstituting the final values for $RVD_{final}$ and $OVD_{final}$ that we have determined:\n$$FWS_{final} = 70\\,\\mathrm{mm} - 69\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$FWS_{final} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThus, the new freeway space after the prosthodontic intervention is $1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "4731801"}, {"introduction": "Functional occlusion is not just about tooth contact; it is about managing the forces transmitted through the teeth to the supporting structures.

The problem provides the applied force and the area over which it is distributed, along with several simplifying assumptions.\n\nThe fundamental principle for this calculation is the definition of stress in mechanics. Normal stress, denoted by the symbol $\\sigma$, is defined as the magnitude of the force, $F$, acting perpendicular to a surface, divided by the area, $A$, over which that force is distributed. The problem specifies that the load is transmitted axially and that shear components are negligible, which confirms that the force is normal to the effective area. The assumption of uniform distribution allows us to calculate the average stress using the formula:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{F}{A}\n$$\n\nFirst, we identify the given quantities from the problem statement:\n- The occlusal force, $F = 150 \\ \\mathrm{N}$.\n- The effective root surface area, $A = 150 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2$.\n\nNext, we substitute these values into the stress formula:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{150 \\ \\mathrm{N}}{150 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2} = 1 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{mm}^2}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in megapascals (MPa). A pascal ($\\mathrm{Pa}$) is the standard International System of Units (SI) unit for pressure and stress, defined as one newton per square meter ($1 \\ \\mathrm{Pa} = 1 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{m}^2}$). A megapascal (MPa) is one million pascals ($1 \\ \\mathrm{MPa} = 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$).\n\nTo convert our result from units of $\\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{mm}^2}$ to MPa, we must establish the relationship between these units. We can do this by converting the area component from square millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}^2$) to square meters ($\\mathrm{m}^2$).\nWe know that $1 \\ \\mathrm{m} = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$, or $1 \\ \\mathrm{m} = 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\nSquaring both sides of this equality gives the conversion for area:\n$$\n(1 \\ \\mathrm{m})^2 = (10^3 \\ \\mathrm{mm})^2\n$$\n$$\n1 \\ \\mathrm{m}^2 = 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2\n$$\nTherefore, $1 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2 = 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}^2$.\n\nNow, we can substitute this into our calculated stress value:\n$$\n\\sigma = 1 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{mm}^2} = 1 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}^2} = 1 \\times 10^6 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{m}^2}\n$$\nSince $1 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{m}^2} = 1 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$, our stress is:\n$$\n\\sigma = 1 \\times 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nGiven that $1 \\ \\mathrm{MPa} = 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$, we find that:\n$$\n\\sigma = 1 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nThis demonstrates the convenient identity that $1 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}$ is exactly equal to $1 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{mm}^2}$, a common relationship used in mechanical and materials engineering.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
