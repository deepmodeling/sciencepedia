The foundational definitions are as follows:\n\n1. The clinical “crown” height for crown-root ratio assessment is the linear extent of tooth structure coronal to the alveolar crest, measured along the long axis. Given the available measurements, the crown height is the distance from the cusp tip to the alveolar crest.\n\n2. The “root in bone” is the linear extent of the root apical to the alveolar crest, measured along the long axis. Given the available measurements, this is the distance from the alveolar crest to the radiographic apex.\n\n3.

For any linear elastic beam with constant cross-section, the deflection is inversely proportional to the flexural rigidity, $EI$, where $E$ is the elastic modulus and $I$ is the second moment of area of the cross-section. This relationship can be expressed generally as:\n$$ \\delta = C \\frac{1}{EI} $$\nHere, the constant of proportionality, $C$, depends on the span length $L$, the boundary conditions (i.e., how the beam is supported at its ends), and the magnitude and distribution of the applied load.
