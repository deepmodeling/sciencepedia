The reduction is to be expressed as a unitless ratio, $R$.\n\nThe governing equation for the bending moment, $M$, at the fulcrum (the rest seat) is given as:\n$$M = F d$$\nwhere $F$ is the applied vertical force and $d$ is the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the force to the fulcrum.\n\nFor the distal rest configuration, the moment, $M_{\\text{distal}}$, is calculated using the distance $d_{\\text{distal}}$.\n$$M_{\\text{distal}} = F \\cdot d_{\\text{distal}}$$\n\nFor the mesial rest configuration, the moment, $M_{\\text{mesial}}$, is calculated using the distance $d_{\\text{mesial}}$.\n$$M_{\\text{mesial}} = F \\cdot d_{\\text{mesial}}$$\n\nThe reduction ratio, $R$, is defined as:\n$$R = \\frac{M_{\\text{distal}} - M_{\\text{mesial}}}{M_{\\text{distal}}}$$\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for $M_{\\text{distal}}$ and $M_{\\text{mesial}}$ into the equation for $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{(F \\cdot d_{\\text{distal}}) - (F \\cdot d_{\\text{mesial}})}{F \\cdot d_{\\text{distal}}}$$\n\nThe force, $F$, is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Optimal Design from First Principles\n\nBased on the provided givens and principles, an optimal design can be systematically derived.\n\n1.  **Major Connector Selection**: The patient's floor-of-mouth height is approximately $6\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. The provided principle states that a lingual bar requires $7$–$8\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ of vertical space. Since $6\\ \\mathrm{mm} < 7\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, a lingual bar is contraindicated. The same principle indicates that a lingual plate is the appropriate alternative. The lingual plate also offers the advantages of splinting the periodontally compromised anterior teeth (if any, though not specified, it's a general benefit) and conveniently incorporating indirect retainers.\n\n2.  **Management of Rotational Forces (Fulcrum Line Biomechanics)**: The case is a Kennedy Class I, a tooth-tissue supported distal extension. The primary biomechanical challenge is the rotation of the denture base into the tissue under occlusal load, which creates a torquing force on the terminal abutments (the second premolars). The abutments are periodontally compromised (CAL of $3$–$4\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, mobility grade $I$), making stress reduction paramount. The provided principle states that mesial rests on terminal abutments, as opposed to distal rests, can reduce this torque. Therefore, mesial occlusal rests on the second premolars are strongly indicated.\n\n3.  **Indirect Retention**: As a Kennedy Class I RPD, the design must incorporate indirect retention to resist the vertical lifting of the distal extension bases away from the tissues (e.g., from sticky foods). The provided principle explicitly defines this requirement. The fulcrum line passes through the rests on the two second premolars. Rests placed anterior to this line will serve as indirect retainers. The lingual plate major connector, chosen in step 1, is ideally suited to include cingulum rests on the canines or incisors for this purpose.\n\n4.  **Direct Retainer (Clasp) Selection**: Direct retainers must provide retention while minimizing stress on the compromised abutments. An RPI clasp is a stress-releasing design, but the provided principle states it requires approximately $3\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ of vertical clearance in the vestibule for the I-bar approach arm. The patient has a buccal vestibule depth of only $2.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. Since $2.5\\ \\mathrm{mm} < 3\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, an RPI clasp is contraindicated due to the risk of tissue impingement. The same principle suggests an RPA (Rest, Proximal plate, Akers) clasp or a wrought wire clasp as an alternative. An RPA clasp, which uses a cast circumferential arm originating from the mesial rest and engaging a mesiobuccal undercut, is a well-accepted stress-releasing design. Given the patient's high esthetic demands and high smile line, an RPA clasp is generally more esthetic than a traditional circumferential clasp engaging a distobuccal undercut.\n\n5.  **Impression Technique**: To maximize support from the edentulous ridge and thereby minimize the load transferred to the compromised abutments, the functional form of the supporting tissues must be accurately recorded. The provided principles state that the altered cast impression technique is designed specifically for this purpose in distal extension cases, as it \"improves tissue support and reduces torque to abutments.\" Therefore, an altered cast impression is indicated.\n\n**Synthesized Optimal Design Plan:**\n- **Major Connector**: Mandibular lingual plate.\n- **Indirect Retention**: Rests on anterior teeth (e.g., canines), integrated into the lingual plate.\n- **Rest/Clasp Assembly on Abutments**: Mesial occlusal rests on the second premolars. Distal proximal plates. RPA clasps engaging mesiobuccal undercuts.\n- **Impression Technique**: Altered cast impression for the distal extension bases.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Mandibular lingual bar major connector; distal occlusal rests on the second premolars; cast circumferential clasps engaging distobuccal undercuts on the second premolars; conventional one-step impression for both tooth and tissue segments; no indirect retainers.**\n\n- **Major Connector**: Incorrect. A lingual bar is contraindicated due to the shallow ($6\\ \\mathrm{mm}$) floor of mouth.\n- **Rests**: Incorrect. Distal rests create a Class I lever, increasing torque on the periodontally compromised abutments.\n- **Clasps**: Incorrect. A cast circumferential clasp engaging a distobuccal undercut is not a stress-releasing design and is biomechanically unfavorable for a distal extension RPD with compromised abutments.\n- **Impression**: Incorrect. A conventional impression does not capture the functional form of the ridge, failing to maximize tissue support and thus increasing abutment torque.\n- **Indirect Retention**: Incorrect. Omission of indirect retainers is a fundamental design violation for a Kennedy Class I RPD.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This design violates multiple fundamental principles and disregards all critical patient findings.\n\n**B.

A lingual plate is indicated by the $6\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ floor-of-mouth depth and correctly incorporates cingulum rests for indirect retention.\n- **Rests**: Correct. Mesial rests are indicated to reduce torque on the compromised abutments.\n- **Clasps**: Correct. An RPA clasp is a suitable stress-releasing alternative to the contraindicated RPI clasp (due to the shallow $2.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ vestibule) and is biomechanically sound.\n- **Impression**: Correct. The altered cast technique is indicated to maximize tissue support and reduce abutment load.\n- **Other Features**: The mention of guiding planes, proximal plates, limited flange height, and occlusal adjustments are all consistent with a well-conceived, comprehensive treatment plan.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.

A lingual bar is contraindicated.\n- **Clasps**: Incorrect. An RPI clasp is contraindicated by the shallow ($2.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$) vestibule.\n- **Impression**: Incorrect. A conventional impression is suboptimal for this case.\n- **Indirect Retention**: Incorrect. Omission is a fundamental flaw. Attempting to compensate with \"tighter clasp retention\" would be highly destructive to the periodontally compromised abutments.\n- **Occlusion**: The application of bilateral balanced occlusion is generally for complete dentures and is not the primary means to control rotation in a distal extension RPD.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option proposes a design that is anatomically impossible (RPI in a shallow vestibule), biomechanically unsound, and fundamentally flawed.\n\n**D. Extracoronal precision attachments in full-coverage surveyed crowns on the second premolars to eliminate visible clasps; distal occlusal rests on the attachments; mandibular labial bar auxiliary connector to permit additional retention; conventional impression; omit altered cast to avoid impression complexity.**\n\n- **Treatment Plan**: Incorrect. Placing full-coverage crowns and expensive precision attachments on teeth with Grade $I$ mobility and $3$–$4\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ of CAL is an overly aggressive and potentially high-risk treatment. A more conservative approach should be considered first.\n- **Rests**: Incorrect. Even with attachments, the biomechanics of a distal extension apply. A distal connection point still functions as a Class I lever, torquing the abutment.\n- **Auxiliary Connector**: Incorrect. A labial bar is indicated for severely retroclined teeth, a condition not stated in the case. Its use for \"additional retention\" is not its primary indication and is a questionable design choice here.\n- **Impression**: Incorrect. Omitting an altered cast impression, especially in a precision attachment case, would be a critical error, leading to a non-passive fit and destructive forces on the abutments.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option is overly invasive, biomechanically flawed, includes a misapplied component, and omits a critical procedural step.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4762171"}]}
