A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\nThe physical principle governing this problem is the inverse-square law. For a point source of radiation, in the absence of attenuation or scattering, the intensity of the radiation beam decreases with the square of the distance from the source. In this context, the radiation intensity at the detector is quantified by the detector air kerma, denoted by $K$. According to the inverse-square law:\n$$K \\propto \\frac{1}{d^2}$$\nwhere $d$ is the distance from the source. In this problem, the relevant distance is the source-to-image distance, $SID$. Thus,\n$$K \\propto \\frac{1}{SID^2}$$\n\nFurthermore, the problem states that for a fixed beam quality (constant $kVp$ and filtration), the air kerma is directly proportional to the total number of photons produced at the target, which is controlled by the tube current-time product, $mAs$.\n$$K \\propto mAs$$\n\nCombining these two proportionalities, we can write a single expression for the detector air kerma. Let $C$ be a constant of proportionality that accounts for all fixed parameters, such as the initial photon fluence rate, beam quality, and detector efficiency.\n$$K = C \\frac{mAs}{SID^2}$$\n\nThe problem requires that the detector air kerma remains constant between the initial and final configurations. Let the initial state be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final state by subscript $2$. The condition is:\n$$K_1 = K_2$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for kerma into this equality:\n$$C \\frac{mAs_1}{SID_1^2} = C \\frac{mAs_2}{SID_2^2}$$\n\nThe constant of proportionality, $C$, is the same for both conditions and cancels out, yielding:\n$$\\frac{mAs_1}{SID_1^2} = \\frac{mAs_2}{SID_2^2}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the new tube current-time product, $mAs_2$. Rearranging the equation to solve for $mAs_2$:\n$$mAs_2 = mAs_1 \\left( \\frac{SID_2^2}{SID_1^2} \\right) = mAs_1 \\left( \\frac{SID_2}{SID_1} \\right)^2$$\n\nThis relationship is often referred to as the exposure maintenance formula or direct square law in radiography. Now, we substitute the given numerical values into this equation:\n-   $mAs_1 = 1.20~\\mathrm{mAs}$\n-   $SID_1 = 200~\\mathrm{mm}$\n-   $SID_2 = 320~\\mathrm{mm}$\n\n$$mAs_2 = 1.20 \\times \\left( \\frac{320}{200} \\right)^2$$\n\nFirst, we evaluate the ratio of the distances:\n$$\\frac{320}{200} = \\frac{32}{20} = \\frac{8}{5} = 1.6$$\n\nNow, we square this ratio:\n$$(1.6)^2 = 2.56$$\n\nFinally, we multiply this factor by the initial $mAs$:\n$$mAs_2 = 1.20 \\times 2.56$$\n$$mAs_2 = 3.072~\\mathrm{mAs}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $3.072$ rounded to three significant figures is $3.07$.\nTherefore, the new tube current-time product required is $3.07~\\mathrm{mAs}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.07}$$", "id": "4710296"}, {"introduction": "Radiographic images are essentially shadowgrams, where contrast arises from the differential attenuation of X-rays by various tissues.

The problem states that the incident photon fluence is uniform across the open field. This means $\\Phi$ is a constant over the entire exposed area $A$.\n\nKinetic Energy Released per unit MAss (KERMA), denoted by $K$, is defined at a point in a medium. It is proportional to the energy fluence, $\\Psi$, at that point. Energy fluence is the product of the photon fluence and the mean photon energy, $E_{avg}$: $\\Psi = \\Phi \\cdot E_{avg}$. Thus, at any point $\\vec{r}$, KERMA is given by:\n$$K(\\vec{r}) = \\Psi(\\vec{r}) \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{tr}}{\\rho} \\right)(\\vec{r})$$\nwhere $\\mu_{tr}$ is the mass energy-transfer coefficient and $\\rho$ is the density of the medium.

This implies that the incident beam's spectral shape and mean energy $E_{avg}$ are constant. As the incident photon fluence $\\Phi$ is also uniform over the area of incidence, the incident energy fluence $\\Psi_0$ is constant for all points $(x, y)$ on the entrance surface.\n\nLet the direction of the beam be along the $z$-axis. The energy fluence at a depth $z$ within the slab, $\\Psi(z)$, will be attenuated relative to the incident energy fluence $\\Psi_0$. This can be written as $\\Psi(z) = \\Psi_0 \\cdot f(z)$, where $f(z)$ is an attenuation function that depends on the material and beam spectrum, but not on the lateral position $(x, y)$ because the incident beam is uniform.\nConsequently, the KERMA at depth $z$, $K(z)$, is also uniform across the irradiated area at that depth:\n$$K(z) = \\Psi(z) \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{tr}}{\\rho} \\right) = \\Psi_0 \\cdot f(z) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{tr}}{\\rho} \\right)$$\n\nAbsorbed dose, $D$, is the energy absorbed per unit mass.
