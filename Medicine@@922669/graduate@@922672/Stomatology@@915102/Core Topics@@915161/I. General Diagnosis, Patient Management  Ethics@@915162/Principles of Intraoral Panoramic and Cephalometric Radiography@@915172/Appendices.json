It describes a direct application of a fundamental principle of radiation physics, the inverse square law, using realistic parameters for dental radiography. All necessary data and simplifying assumptions are provided.\n\nThe problem asks for a statement of the inverse square law derived from first principles and its application to calculate a new entrance air kerma.\n\nThe source of X-rays in a radiographic unit can be approximated as a point source. For a point source emitting radiation, the energy is distributed over the surface of an expanding sphere. Let $\\Phi$ represent the total radiant power or photon flux (photons per unit time) emitted by the source into the solid angle defined by the collimator. Assuming no attenuation of the beam by the intervening medium (in this case, air, which is a valid assumption for the short distances and photon energies in diagnostic radiography), this power $\\Phi$ remains constant as it travels away from the source.\n\nThe intensity of the radiation, $I$, is defined as the power per unit area. At a distance $d$ from the source, the radiation is spread over a portion of a spherical surface. The surface area of a full sphere is $A = 4\\pi d^2$. Therefore, the intensity is given by:\n$$I = \\frac{\\Phi}{4\\pi d^2}$$\nThis equation shows that the intensity $I$ is inversely proportional to the square of the distance $d$ from the source. This is the inverse square law.\n$$I \\propto \\frac{1}{d^2}$$\nAir kerma, $K$, which stands for \"kinetic energy released per unit mass\" of air, is a measure of the concentration of radiation at a point. It is directly proportional to the radiation intensity, $I$. Consequently, the air kerma also adheres to the inverse square law:\n$$K \\propto \\frac{1}{d^2}$$\nTo compare the kerma at two different distances, $d_1$ and $d_2$, we can establish a ratio. Let $K_1$ be the air kerma at distance $d_1$, and $K_2$ be the air kerma at distance $d_2$. From the proportionality, we can write $K = \\frac{c}{d^2}$, where $c$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on the source's output (tube potential, current, time, filtration, etc.), which are stated to be constant in this problem.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n$$K_1 = \\frac{c}{d_1^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad K_2 = \\frac{c}{d_2^2}$$\nDividing the second equation by the first gives the formal mathematical statement of the inverse square law for this application:\n$$\\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \\frac{c/d_2^2}{c/d_1^2} = \\frac{d_1^2}{d_2^2}$$\nThis can be rearranged to solve for the unknown kerma, $K_2$:\n$$K_2 = K_1 \\left( \\frac{d_1}{d_2} \\right)^2$$\nNow, we can apply this law to the specific values provided in the problem.\n\nThe given parameters are:\nInitial entrance air kerma, $K_1 = 1.48\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$.\nInitial source-to-skin distance, $d_1 = 20\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\nFinal source-to-skin distance, $d_2 = 40\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$K_2 = (1.48\\,\\mathrm{mGy}) \\left( \\frac{20\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{40\\,\\mathrm{cm}} \\right)^2$$\nThe units of distance ($\\mathrm{cm}$) in the ratio cancel out, as required.\n$$K_2 = 1.48 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2$$\n$$K_2 = 1.48 \\times \\frac{1}{4}$$\n$$K_2 = 0.37\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed to three significant figures.

To express this result to three significant figures, we append a zero.\n$$K_2 = 0.370\\,\\mathrm{mGy}$$\nThis is the new entrance air kerma at the patient's skin surface when the distance is increased to $40\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.370}$$", "id": "4760563"}, {"introduction": "Beyond understanding radiation dose, creating a diagnostically useful image depends on precise geometric alignment. A 'cone-cut' is a common artifact resulting from misalignment, which can render an image useless and necessitate a retake, exposing the patient to additional radiation. This exercise challenges you to apply first principles of projection geometry to quantitatively predict and diagnose a cone-cut, translating abstract concepts into a practical clinical skill [@problem_id:4760611].", "problem": "A patient undergoes an intraoral periapical radiograph of the mandibular molars using the paralleling technique with a digital size $2$ receptor whose nominal active area is $31\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\times 41\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, i.e., width $w = 3.1\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and height $h = 4.1\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. The Position Indicating Device (PID) is fitted with a round collimator that produces a circular primary beam cross-section of diameter $d = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ at the receptor plane. The clinician reports that the PID face was miscentered mesially relative to the receptor center by an estimated $\\Delta_x = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ while vertical alignment was otherwise perpendicular to the receptor. The resulting image shows a sharply demarcated, semicircular white (unexposed) region along the mesial edge of the receptor.\n\nFrom first principles of x-ray projection geometry and beam-limiting collimation, consider the following base concepts:\n\n- The circular beam cross-section at the receptor plane can be idealized as a circle of radius $r = d/2$ centered on the PID axis, and the receptor as a rectangle of width $w$ and height $h$ centered on its own midline.\n- The collimator blocks primary photons outside the circle, so any receptor region lying outside the circle receives negligible primary exposure and appears white relative to exposed regions, independent of kilovoltage peak ($\\mathrm{kVp}$) or tube current-time product ($\\mathrm{mAs}$) settings.\n- Neglect scatter and heel effect for the purpose of determining the presence or absence of primary coverage; intensity variations according to the inverse square law $I \\propto 1/\\mathrm{SID}^2$ do not create sharply demarcated unexposed borders.\n\nUsing these base concepts, reason about whether the stated miscentering produces a cone-cut artifact.

Apply the given numerical values to decide if cone-cut should occur. Then, identify the artifact and provide a step-by-step correction that eliminates recurrence on subsequent exposures by addressing beam centering and alignment relative to the receptor.\n\nWhich option best identifies the artifact and provides the correct derivation and correction?\n\nA. The artifact is a cone-cut due to improper PID centering. By modeling the beam as a circle of radius $r$ and the receptor as a rectangle of width $w$, full horizontal coverage requires $|\\Delta_x| \\le r - w/2$. With $d = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, $r = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and $w = 3.1\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, $r - w/2 = 2.5 - 1.55 = 0.95\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. Because $\\Delta_x = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{cm} > 0.95\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, the mesial edge lies outside the primary field, producing a sharply demarcated unexposed arc. Correction: (i) seat the receptor fully and stabilize its holder so the receptor midline aligns with the tooth of interest, (ii) use the beam-aiming device’s ring to visually center the PID so the circular light field symmetrically covers all receptor borders, (iii) ensure the PID axis is perpendicular to the receptor (paralleling technique) in both horizontal and vertical planes, (iv) maintain a consistent source-to-image distance ($\\mathrm{SID}$) and verify collimator-to-receptor coupling, and (v) re-expose confirming that $|\\Delta_x|$ is less than $r - w/2$.\n\nB. The artifact is global underexposure from low $\\mathrm{kVp}$ and $\\mathrm{mAs}$. The sharply white region occurs because photon energy is insufficient to penetrate molar structures; increase $\\mathrm{kVp}$ by $+10\\,\\mathrm{kVp}$ and double $\\mathrm{mAs}$ to correct. Geometric centering is not relevant when exposure is low.\n\nC. The artifact is vertical angulation error causing elongation and cervical burnout. The white area at the mesial edge reflects reduced projection due to shallow vertical angulation. Correction: increase vertical angulation by $+10^\\circ$ and angle the PID toward the occlusal plane without changing centering.\n\nD. The artifact reflects panoramic positioning error where the patient’s mid-sagittal plane is rotated and the anterior teeth lie out of the focal trough, causing band-like voids. Correction: reposition on the panoramic unit’s bite block, align the mid-sagittal plane and Frankfort plane, and repeat the panoramic scan.\n\nE. The artifact is due to an excessively short source-to-image distance ($\\mathrm{SID}$) producing an intensity drop-off at the receptor margins per the inverse square law.

The beam is an ideal circle of radius $r = d/2$. The receptor is an ideal rectangle of width $w$ and height $h$.\n    2.  Regions outside the beam are unexposed (white) due to collimation.\n    3.  Scatter and heel effect are neglected for determining primary coverage.\n    4.  Inverse square law does not create sharply demarcated borders.\n*   **Task:** Identify the artifact, derive the geometric condition for full coverage, apply numerical values, and describe the correction.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n*   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is grounded in the established principles of projection radiography. The description of a \"cone-cut\" artifact—a sharply defined unexposed region caused by misalignment between the x-ray beam and the receptor—is scientifically accurate. The numerical values for a size $2$ receptor ($3.1\\,\\mathrm{cm} \\times 4.1\\,\\mathrm{cm}$) and a standard round collimator's beam diameter (typically between $6\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and $7\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ by regulation, but $5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ is a plausible value for this problem's setup, especially at the receptor plane with some divergence) are realistic. The geometric model proposed is the standard first-principles approach to analyzing this artifact.\n*   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary geometric parameters ($w$, $d$, $\\Delta_x$) to determine if the receptor is fully covered by the beam. A unique answer can be derived from the provided information and geometric model.\n*   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language common to medical physics and radiology.\n\n*   **Analysis of Potential Flaws:**\n    1.  **Scientific or Factual Unsoundness:** There is a minor inconsistency in the problem statement. It states the PID is \"miscentered mesially\" and that the resulting cone-cut is \"along the mesial edge\". In standard coordinate systems, a mesial shift of the beam's center relative to the receptor's center would better cover the mesial edge and potentially leave the *distal* edge uncovered. A cone-cut on the mesial edge would be caused by a *distal* misalignment. However, this is a minor error in directional description, not a violation of fundamental principles. The core of the problem lies in the magnitude of the offset causing a lack of coverage, which is a sound physical concept. The question can be answered based on the magnitude of the error, which is the central point.\n    2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant:** The problem is explicitly formalizable as a question of 2D geometry and is directly relevant to the principles of intraoral radiography.\n    3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** Besides the minor directional inconsistency noted above, the problem is self-contained and consistent. It provides a clear set of assumptions to work with.\n    4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The scenario and values are realistic and common in clinical practice.\n    5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured:** The problem structure is clear and leads to a unique solution regarding the presence and cause of the artifact.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. The minor directional inconsistency is an error in the narrative description but does not undermine the core physical and mathematical question being posed, which is whether the given magnitude of misalignment causes a cone-cut. Proceeding to solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem describes an artifact and asks for its identification, a quantitative justification, and the corrective procedure, based on first principles of projection geometry.\n\n1.  **Artifact Identification:** The description of a \"sharply demarcated, semicircular white (unexposed) region\" on an x-ray image is the pathognomonic sign of a **cone-cut**. This artifact occurs when the primary x-ray beam, shaped by the collimator (the \"cone\"), fails to irradiate the entire active area of the radiographic receptor. The unexposed portion of the receptor does not react and appears white on the final image. The cause is a misalignment of the central axis of the x-ray beam with the geometric center of the receptor.\n\n2.  **Geometric Condition for Full Coverage:**\n    *   We model the receptor as a rectangle centered at the origin $(0,0)$ of a Cartesian coordinate system. Its horizontal dimension extends from $x = -w/2$ to $x = +w/2$.\n    *   The circular x-ray beam has a radius $r = d/2$. Its center is displaced horizontally from the origin by an offset $\\Delta_x$. The beam's center is at $(\\Delta_x, 0)$.\n    *   For the entire width of the receptor to be exposed, every point on the receptor's horizontal midline must be inside or on the boundary of the circular beam. This requires that the extent of the beam covers the extent of the receptor.\n    *   The horizontal extent of the beam is $[\\Delta_x - r, \\Delta_x + r]$.\n    *   The horizontal extent of the receptor is $[-w/2, w/2]$.\n    *   For full coverage, we must satisfy two conditions:\n        1.  The left edge of the beam must be to the left of or at the left edge of the receptor: $\\Delta_x - r \\le -w/2$.\n        2.  The right edge of the beam must be to the right of or at the right edge of the receptor: $\\Delta_x + r \\ge +w/2$.\n    *   Rearranging these inequalities to solve for the acceptable range of the offset $\\Delta_x$:\n        1.  $\\Delta_x \\le r - w/2$\n        2.  $\\Delta_x \\ge -r + w/2 \\implies \\Delta_x \\ge -(r - w/2)$\n    *   Combining these two conditions, we find that for full coverage, the magnitude of the horizontal offset must be less than or equal to the difference between the beam radius and half the receptor width:\n        $$|\\Delta_x| \\le r - \\frac{w}{2}$$\n    *   If $|\\Delta_x| > r - w/2$, a portion of the receptor will not be exposed, resulting in a cone-cut.\n\n3.  **Application of Numerical Values:**\n    *   Given beam diameter $d = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, the beam radius is $r = d/2 = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n    *   Given receptor width $w = 3.1\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, half the width is $w/2 = 1.55\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n    *   Given horizontal offset $\\Delta_x = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n    *   First, we calculate the maximum allowable offset for full coverage:\n        $$r - \\frac{w}{2} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{cm} - 1.55\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 0.95\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\n    *   Next, we compare the actual offset to the maximum allowable offset:\n        $$|\\Delta_x| = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\n    *   Since $1.2\\,\\mathrm{cm} > 0.95\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, the condition $|\\Delta_x| \\le r - w/2$ is violated. Therefore, the stated misalignment is geometrically sufficient to cause a cone-cut artifact, which confirms the observation.\n\n4.  **Correction:** The fundamental error is the misalignment of the beam with the receptor. The correction must address this geometric error. For the paralleling technique, receptor-holding instruments with external beam-aiming devices (rings) are standard. The correction involves:\n    *   Ensuring the receptor is correctly placed in the holder and the holder is correctly positioned in the mouth to image the target teeth.\n    *   Bringing the PID up to the aiming ring so that the circular face of the PID is parallel to and concentric with the ring. This mechanical alignment ensures that the central ray of the x-ray beam is directed at the center of the receptor and is perpendicular to it, fulfilling the requirements of the paralleling technique and guaranteeing full receptor coverage.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. The artifact is a cone-cut due to improper PID centering. By modeling the beam as a circle of radius $r$ and the receptor as a rectangle of width $w$, full horizontal coverage requires $|\\Delta_x| \\le r - w/2$. With $d = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, $r = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and $w = 3.1\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, $r - w/2 = 2.5 - 1.55 = 0.95\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. Because $\\Delta_x = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{cm} > 0.95\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, the mesial edge lies outside the primary field, producing a sharply demarcated unexposed arc. Correction: (i) seat the receptor fully and stabilize its holder so the receptor midline aligns with the tooth of interest, (ii) use the beam-aiming device’s ring to visually center the PID so the circular light field symmetrically covers all receptor borders, (iii) ensure the PID axis is perpendicular to the receptor (paralleling technique) in both horizontal and vertical planes, (iv) maintain a consistent source-to-image distance ($\\mathrm{SID}$) and verify collimator-to-receptor coupling, and (v) re-expose confirming that $|\\Delta_x|$ is less than $r - w/2$.**\n    *   **Evaluation:** This option correctly identifies the artifact as a cone-cut. The derived geometric condition $|\\Delta_x| \\le r - w/2$ is correct. The numerical calculation ($r - w/2 = 0.95\\,\\mathrm{cm}$) and the comparison ($\\Delta_x = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{cm} > 0.95\\,\\mathrm{cm}$) are both correct and logically lead to the conclusion that a cone-cut will occur. The corrective steps are comprehensive and clinically accurate, with step (ii) being the most direct fix for the described error. While the statement \"the mesial edge lies outside the primary field\" perpetuates the minor directional inconsistency from the prompt, the entirety of the diagnosis, derivation, and correction is sound and based on correct principles.\n    *   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. The artifact is global underexposure from low $\\mathrm{kVp}$ and $\\mathrm{mAs}$. The sharply white region occurs because photon energy is insufficient to penetrate molar structures; increase $\\mathrm{kVp}$ by $+10\\,\\mathrm{kVp}$ and double $\\mathrm{mAs}$ to correct. Geometric centering is not relevant when exposure is low.**\n    *   **Evaluation:** This is incorrect. Underexposure affects the entire image, causing a universally light or \"thin\" appearance, not a sharp geometric cutoff at one edge. The claim that centering is irrelevant is fundamentally false in radiography.\n    *   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. The artifact is vertical angulation error causing elongation and cervical burnout. The white area at the mesial edge reflects reduced projection due to shallow vertical angulation. Correction: increase vertical angulation by $+10^\\circ$ and angle the PID toward the occlusal plane without changing centering.**\n    *   **Evaluation:** This is incorrect. An error in vertical angulation causes shape distortion (elongation or foreshortening), not a cone-cut. A completely unexposed region is due to a lack of photons, not projection geometry distortion. The problem states vertical alignment was correct.\n    *   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. The artifact reflects panoramic positioning error where the patient’s mid-sagittal plane is rotated and the anterior teeth lie out of the focal trough, causing band-like voids. Correction: reposition on the panoramic unit’s bite block, align the mid-sagittal plane and Frankfort plane, and repeat the panoramic scan.**\n    *   **Evaluation:** This describes errors related to a completely different imaging modality (panoramic radiography). The problem specifies an intraoral periapical radiograph.\n    *   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E. The artifact is due to an excessively short source-to-image distance ($\\mathrm{SID}$) producing an intensity drop-off at the receptor margins per the inverse square law. Correction: increase $\\mathrm{SID}$ to $40\\,\\mathrm{cm}$; centering is not required if $\\mathrm{SID}$ is adequate.**\n    *   **Evaluation:** This is incorrect. The inverse square law describes a gradual fall-off in intensity, which would appear as a subtle darkening towards the center of the film, not a \"sharply demarcated\" white region.

It is a well-posed, scientifically sound problem in medical imaging physics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is based on the principle of similar triangles in a point-source X-ray projection system. The geometric magnification, $M$, is the ratio of the size of the image projected on the detector to the true physical size of the object.\n\nLet $D_{obj}$ be the true physical diameter of an object.\nLet $d_{img}$ be the diameter of its\nimage projected on the detector plane.\nThe magnification is $M = \\frac{d_{img}}{D_{obj}}$.\n\nFrom the geometry of similar triangles, the magnification is also given by the ratio of the Source-to-Detector Distance ($SDD$) to the Source-to-Object Distance ($SOD$).\n$$M = \\frac{SDD}{SOD}$$\nThe problem provides the Object-to-Detector Distance ($ODD$). The relationship between these distances is:\n$$SOD = SDD - ODD$$\nTherefore, the magnification formula can be expressed in terms of the given quantities:\n$$M = \\frac{SDD}{SDD - ODD}$$\nCombining these, we can relate the true object size to its projected image size:\n$$\\frac{d_{img}}{D_{obj}} = \\frac{SDD}{SDD - ODD}$$\n$$D_{obj} = d_{img} \\times \\frac{SDD - ODD}{SDD}$$\n\nThis relationship holds for both the calibration ball and the lesion. However, since their $ODD$ values are different, their magnification factors will be different.\n\nLet $p$ be the physical size of a single pixel in millimeters per pixel (pixel pitch). The physical size of an image on the detector ($d_{img,mm}$) is the product of its size in pixels ($d_{img,px}$) and the pixel pitch ($p$).\n$d_{img,mm} = d_{img,px} \\times p$.\n\nFor the calibration ball:\n$D_{ball} = d_{ball,mm} \\times \\frac{SDD - ODD_{ball}}{SDD} = (d_{ball,px} \\times p) \\times \\frac{SDD - ODD_{ball}}{SDD}$.\n(Equation 1)\n\nFor the lesion:\n$D_{lesion} = d_{lesion,mm} \\times \\frac{SDD - ODD_{lesion}}{SDD} = (d_{lesion,px} \\times p) \\times \\frac{SDD - ODD_{lesion}}{SDD}$.\n(Equation 2)\n\nThe pixel pitch $p$ is an unknown constant of the detector. We can eliminate it by taking the ratio of Equation 2 to Equation 1.\n$$\\frac{D_{lesion}}{D_{ball}} = \\frac{(d_{lesion,px} \\times p) \\times \\frac{SDD - ODD_{lesion}}{SDD}}{(d_{ball,px} \\times p) \\times \\frac{SDD - ODD_{ball}}{SDD}}$$\nThe terms $p$ and $SDD$ cancel out, yielding a direct relationship between the known and unknown quantities:\n$$\\frac{D_{lesion}}{D_{ball}} = \\frac{d_{lesion,px}}{d_{ball,px}} \\times \\frac{SDD - ODD_{lesion}}{SDD - ODD_{ball}}$$\nWe can now solve for the true diameter of the lesion, $D_{lesion}$:\n$$D_{lesion} = D_{ball} \\times \\frac{d_{lesion,px}}{d_{ball,px}} \\times \\frac{SDD - ODD_{lesion}}{SDD - ODD_{ball}}$$\nThis formula correctly shows that the true lesion size is determined by scaling the known ball size by the ratio of their image sizes, corrected by a factor that accounts for their different positions relative to the source and detector.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n-   $D_{ball} = 10 \\text{ mm}$\n-   $d_{lesion,px} = 260$\n-   $d_{ball,px} = 420$\n-   $SDD = 300 \\text{ mm}$\n-   $ODD_{lesion} = 15 \\text{ mm}$\n-   $ODD_{ball} = 10 \\text{ mm}$\n\n$$D_{lesion} = 10 \\times \\frac{260}{420} \\times \\frac{300 - 15}{300 - 10}$$\n$$D_{lesion} = 10 \\times \\frac{260}{420} \\times \\frac{285}{290}$$\nWe can simplify the fractions:\n$$\\frac{260}{420} = \\frac{26}{42} = \\frac{13}{21}$$\n$$\\frac{285}{290} = \\frac{5 \\times 57}{5 \\times 58} = \\frac{57}{58}$$\nSubstituting back into the equation for $D_{lesion}$:\n$$D_{lesion} = 10 \\times \\frac{13}{21} \\times \\frac{57}{58}$$\nWe can perform further simplification noting that $21 = 3 \\times 7$ and $57 = 3 \\times 19$:\n$$D_{lesion} = 10 \\times \\frac{13}{3 \\times 7} \\times \\frac{3 \\times 19}{58} = 10 \\times \\frac{13}{7} \\times \\frac{19}{58}$$\nAlso, $58 = 2 \\times 29$:\n$$D_{lesion} = 10 \\times \\frac{13}{7} \\times \\frac{19}{2 \\times 29} = 5 \\times \\frac{13 \\times 19}{7 \\times 29}$$\n$$D_{lesion} = \\frac{5 \\times 247}{203} = \\frac{1235}{203}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$D_{lesion} \\approx 6.0837438 \\text{ mm}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $6$, $0$, and $8$. The next digit is $3$, so we round down.\n$$D_{lesion} \\approx 6.08 \\text{ mm}$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{6.08}\n$$", "id": "4760486"}]}
