A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the Fraction of Inspired Oxygen, $F_{\\text{iO}_2}$, for a gas mixture. By definition, $F_{\\text{iO}_2}$ is the fraction of oxygen in the gaseous mixture delivered to the patient. For a mixture of ideal gases, the fraction of a component gas can be equivalently expressed as its volume fraction, mole fraction, or partial pressure fraction.\n\nLet's begin by relating the given volumetric flow rates to molar quantities. The problem states that the volumetric flow rates, $Q_{\\text{O}_2}$ and $Q_{\\text{N}_2\\text{O}}$, are referenced to Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). According to Avogadro's law, under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of different ideal gases contain an equal number of molecules. This principle allows us to relate volumetric flow rates at a common reference state (STP) directly to molar flow rates.\n\nLet $\\dot{n}_{\\text{O}_2}$ be the molar flow rate of oxygen and $\\dot{n}_{\\text{N}_2\\text{O}}$ be the molar flow rate of nitrous oxide. The total molar flow rate is $\\dot{n}_{total} = \\dot{n}_{\\text{O}_2} + \\dot{n}_{\\text{N}_2\\text{O}}$.\nThe mole fraction of oxygen, $\\chi_{\\text{O}_2}$, is given by:\n$$ \\chi_{\\text{O}_2} = \\frac{\\dot{n}_{\\text{O}_2}}{\\dot{n}_{total}} = \\frac{\\dot{n}_{\\text{O}_2}}{\\dot{n}_{\\text{O}_2} + \\dot{n}_{\\text{N}_2\\text{O}}} $$\nFrom the ideal gas law, $PV = nRT$, the molar flow rate $\\dot{n}$ can be related to the volumetric flow rate $Q$ by $\\dot{n} = \\frac{P_{ref} Q}{R T_{ref}}$, where $P_{ref}$ and $T_{ref}$ are the reference pressure and temperature (STP in this case).\nSubstituting this into the mole fraction equation:\n$$ \\chi_{\\text{O}_2} = \\frac{\\frac{P_{STP} Q_{\\text{O}_2}}{R T_{STP}}}{\\frac{P_{STP} Q_{\\text{O}_2}}{R T_{STP}} + \\frac{P_{STP} Q_{\\text{N}_2\\text{O}}}{R T_{STP}}} = \\frac{Q_{\\text{O}_2}}{Q_{\\text{O}_2} + Q_{\\text{N}_2\\text{O}}} $$\nThe constant term $\\frac{P_{STP}}{R T_{STP}}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator. This rigorously justifies that the mole fraction is equal to the ratio of the STP-referenced volumetric flow rates.\n\nThe problem asks to ground the derivation in Dalton's law of partial pressures. Dalton's law states that the total pressure of a mixture of non-reacting gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases: $P_{total} = P_{\\text{O}_2} + P_{\\text{N}_2\\text{O}}$. The partial pressure of a component gas, $P_i$, in an ideal gas mixture is given by $P_i = \\chi_i P_{total}$, where $\\chi_i$ is the mole fraction of that component.\nThe Fraction of Inspired Oxygen, $F_{\\text{iO}_2}$, is defined as the fraction of oxygen, which, in terms of partial pressures, is:\n$$ F_{\\text{iO}_2} = \\frac{P_{\\text{O}_2}}{P_{total}} $$\nCombining this with the partial pressure equation, we see that $F_{\\text{iO}_2} = \\chi_{\\text{O}_2}$. Thus, the calculation of the mole fraction of oxygen is equivalent to calculating $F_{\\text{iO}_2}$.\n$$ F_{\\text{iO}_2} = \\chi_{\\text{O}_2} = \\frac{Q_{\\text{O}_2}}{Q_{\\text{O}_2} + Q_{\\text{N}_2\\text{O}}} $$\nThis derived expression for $F_{\\text{iO}_2}$ uses only the given volumetric flow rates, as required.\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into the derived formula.\nThe oxygen flow rate is $Q_{\\text{O}_2} = 4\\,\\mathrm{L/min}$.\nThe nitrous oxide flow rate is $Q_{\\text{N}_2\\text{O}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{L/min}$.\nThe total volumetric flow rate, $Q_{total}$, is the sum of the individual flow rates due to the conservation of volume in a steady-state, non-reacting mixture under isobaric conditions.\n$$ Q_{total} = Q_{\\text{O}_2} + Q_{\\text{N}_2\\text{O}} = 4\\,\\mathrm{L/min} + 2\\,\\mathrm{L/min} = 6\\,\\mathrm{L/min} $$\nThe Fraction of Inspired Oxygen is then calculated as:\n$$ F_{\\text{iO}_2} = \\frac{Q_{\\text{O}_2}}{Q_{total}} = \\frac{4\\,\\mathrm{L/min}}{6\\,\\mathrm{L/min}} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nTo express this as a decimal rounded to four significant figures:\n$$ F_{\\text{iO}_2} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.66666... \\approx 0.6667 $$\n\nThe final step is to assess this value against the specified safety target, which is $F_{\\text{iO}_2} \\geq 0.30$.\nWe compare the calculated value to the target value:\n$$ 0.6667 \\geq 0.30 $$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the delivered gas mixture with an $F_{\\text{iO}_2}$ of approximately $0.6667$ meets and exceeds the minimum safety target for oxygenation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6667}$$", "id": "4703038"}, {"introduction": "Moving from inhaled to intravenous agents, this practice focuses on the careful planning required for titrating drugs like midazolam.

We will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation of the elimination half-life, $t_{1/2}$, from first principles for a drug following a one-compartment model with first-order elimination.\n\nLet $A(t)$ be the amount of drug in the body at time $t$.\nLet $C(t)$ be the concentration of the drug in the plasma at time $t$.\nLet $V_d$ be the volume of distribution.\nLet $CL$ be the clearance.\n\nThe derivation is based on three core principles:\n$1$. The definition of clearance: Clearance, $CL$, is the proportionality constant that relates the rate of drug elimination, $R_{el}$, to the plasma concentration, $C(t)$.\n$$R_{el}(t) = CL \\cdot C(t)$$\nThis rate has units of amount per time (e.g., mg/h).\n\n$2$. The principle of conservation of mass: For an elimination process, the rate of change of the amount of drug in the body, $\\frac{dA(t)}{dt}$, is equal to the negative of the rate of elimination.\n$$\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -R_{el}(t)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{el}(t)$ gives:\n$$\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -CL \\cdot C(t)$$\n\n$3$. The definition of the volume of distribution: $V_d$ relates the total amount of drug in the body, $A(t)$, to the measured plasma concentration, $C(t)$.\n$$V_d = \\frac{A(t)}{C(t)}$$\nThis definition can be rearranged to express the concentration in terms of the amount:\n$$C(t) = \\frac{A(t)}{V_d}$$\n\nNow, we combine these principles. We substitute the expression for $C(t)$ from the definition of $V_d$ into the mass balance equation:\n$$\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -CL \\cdot \\frac{A(t)}{V_d}$$\nThis can be rearranged into the standard form of a first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -\\left(\\frac{CL}{V_d}\\right) A(t)$$\nThe term $\\frac{CL}{V_d}$ is the first-order elimination rate constant, denoted as $k_{el}$.\n$$k_{el} = \\frac{CL}{V_d}$$\nThe solution to the differential equation $\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -k_{el} A(t)$ is an exponential decay function:\n$$A(t) = A_0 \\exp(-k_{el} t)$$\nwhere $A_0$ is the initial amount of drug in the body at time $t=0$. Substituting the expression for $k_{el}$:\n$$A(t) = A_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V_d} t\\right)$$\nThe elimination half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time required for the amount of drug in the body to decrease to one-half of its initial value. At $t=t_{1/2}$, we have $A(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{A_0}{2}$.\nSetting this condition in the equation:\n$$\\frac{A_0}{2} = A_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V_d} t_{1/2}\\right)$$\nDividing both sides by $A_0$ (assuming $A_0 > 0$):\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V_d} t_{1/2}\\right)$$\nTo solve for $t_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V_d} t_{1/2}\\right)\\right)$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln(\\frac{1}{x}) = -\\ln(x)$ and $\\ln(\\exp(y))=y$:\n$$-\\ln(2) = -\\frac{CL}{V_d} t_{1/2}$$\nFinally, we solve for $t_{1/2}$:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{V_d \\ln(2)}{CL}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the elimination half-life in terms of the volume of distribution and clearance. Note that the patient's mass, $m = 70$ $\\text{kg}$, is not needed for this derivation, nor for the calculation, because the provided parameters $V_d$ and $CL$ are already normalized by body mass, and their ratio makes the mass unit cancel out.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for $t_{1/2}$ using the given parameters:\nVolume of distribution, $V_{d} = 1.5$ $\\text{L}/\\text{kg}$\nClearance, $CL = 0.6$ $\\text{L}/\\text{h}/\\text{kg}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{(1.5 \\, \\text{L}/\\text{kg}) \\cdot \\ln(2)}{0.6 \\, \\text{L}/\\text{h}/\\text{kg}}$$\nThe units $(\\text{L}/\\text{kg})$ cancel, leaving hours ($\\text{h}$) as the unit for time, as expected.\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{1.5}{0.6} \\ln(2) \\, \\text{h}$$\n$$t_{1/2} = 2.5 \\ln(2) \\, \\text{h}$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147...$:\n$$t_{1/2} \\approx 2.5 \\times 0.693147 \\, \\text{h} \\approx 1.7328675 \\, \\text{h}$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$t_{1/2} \\approx 1.73 \\, \\text{h}$$\n\n**Discussion**\n\nThe calculated elimination half-life ($t_{1/2}$) of midazolam for this patient model is approximately $1.73$ hours. This value is central to planning post-procedure care.\n\n$1$. **Recovery Time and Observation:** The clinical effects of an intravenous (IV) bolus of midazolam often subside faster than the elimination half-life would suggest. This initial rapid recovery is primarily due to the redistribution of the drug from the central nervous system to peripheral tissues, a process with a much shorter half-time than the elimination half-life. However, the $t_{1/2}$ of $1.73$ hours indicates that a significant amount of drug remains in the plasma for several hours. Complete elimination is considered to take approximately $4-5$ half-lives, which corresponds to $6.9$ to $8.7$ hours. During this period, the patient will continue to experience residual effects, including cognitive and psychomotor impairment, and anterograde amnesia. Therefore, post-procedure observation in the clinic is mandatory until the patient is stable. Furthermore, the patient must be discharged into the care of a responsible adult and strictly instructed not to drive, operate machinery, or make important legal or financial decisions for at least $24$ hours.\n\n$2$. **Patient Factors:** The calculation is based on parameters for a \"healthy adult.\" Clinical practice must account for individual patient variability. For example:\n- **Elderly patients** often exhibit reduced hepatic clearance ($CL$), which would increase $t_{1/2}$ and prolong sedation.\n- **Obese patients** may have an increased volume of distribution ($V_d$) for lipophilic drugs like midazolam, also potentially increasing $t_{1/2}$.\n- **Patients with hepatic impairment** will have a significantly reduced $CL$ as midazolam is metabolized by the liver, leading to a markedly prolonged half-life and increased risk of prolonged sedation.\n- **Drug interactions** with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme system (e.g., certain antibiotics, azole antifungals) will decrease $CL$ and increase $t_{1/2}$.\nThese factors necessitate careful dose titration and extended observation in at-risk populations.\n\n$3$. **Role of Flumazenil:** Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist used to reverse midazolam-induced sedation. It can be life-saving in cases of overdose or severe respiratory depression. However, its use requires caution due to a mismatch in pharmacokinetics. Flumazenil has a short half-life (approximately $1$ hour), which is significantly shorter than that of midazolam ($1.73$ hours). This disparity creates a risk of *resedation*—the patient may initially awaken after flumazenil administration, only to become sedated again as the flumazenil is eliminated while midazolam levels remain clinically significant. Consequently, any patient reversed with flumazenil requires prolonged monitoring until the risk of resedation has passed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.73}$$", "id": "4703040"}]}
