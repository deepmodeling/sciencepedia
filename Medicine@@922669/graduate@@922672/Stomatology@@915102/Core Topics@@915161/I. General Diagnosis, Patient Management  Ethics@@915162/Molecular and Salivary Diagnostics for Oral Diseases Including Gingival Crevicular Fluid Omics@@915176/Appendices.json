Calculation of LOD and LOQ**\n\nAccording to the ICH Q2(R1) guidance, the limit of detection ($LOD$) and limit of quantification ($LOQ$) can be calculated from the standard deviation of the response ($\\sigma$) and the slope of the calibration curve ($S$).\n\nThe $LOD$ is defined as the lowest concentration that can be reliably detected.

The formula is:\n$$LOQ = \\frac{10 \\sigma}{S}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$LOQ = \\frac{10 \\times (5.00 \\times 10^{-6})}{2.50 \\times 10^{-3}} \\, \\text{ng/mL}$$\n$$LOQ = \\frac{5.00 \\times 10^{-5}}{2.50 \\times 10^{-3}} \\, \\text{ng/mL}$$\n$$LOQ = 2.00 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\text{ng/mL}$$\nThis value is already expressed to three significant figures. Thus, the $LOQ$ is $0.0200\\,\\text{ng/mL}$.\n\n**2. Justification of Assay Reliability at the Clinical Threshold**\n\nTo justify whether the assay can reliably detect and quantify the biomarker at the clinical decision threshold ($C_{\\mathrm{thr}}$), we must compare $C_{\\mathrm{thr}}$ with the calculated $LOD$ and $LOQ$.\n\n- For reliable detection, the analyte concentration must be greater than the $LOD$.\n- For reliable quantification, the analyte concentration must be greater than the $LOQ$.\n\nThe clinical threshold is $C_{\\mathrm{thr}} = 2.00\\,\\text{ng/mL}$.\nThe calculated limits are:\n- $LOD = 6.60 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{ng/mL}$\n- $LOQ = 2.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{ng/mL}$\n\nComparing the threshold to the limits:\nThe ratio of the clinical threshold to the detection limit is:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{thr}}}{LOD} = \\frac{2.00}{6.60 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 303$$\nThe ratio of the clinical threshold to the quantification limit is:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{thr}}}{LOQ} = \\frac{2.00}{2.00 \\times 10^{-2}} = 100$$\n\nSince $C_{\\mathrm{thr}}$ is approximately $303$ times greater than the $LOD$ and exactly $100$ times greater than the $LOQ$, the concentration at the clinical decision threshold is well above both the detection and quantification limits. This large separation ensures that the assay can not only detect the presence of the biomarker but also measure its concentration with high confidence, precision, and accuracy at clinically relevant levels. Therefore, the assay is unequivocally reliable for its intended purpose.\n\n**3. Calculation of Margin Factor M**\n\nThe margin factor $M$ is defined as the ratio of the clinical decision threshold concentration to the limit of quantification:\n$$M = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{thr}}}{LOQ}$$\nUsing the values for $C_{\\mathrm{thr}}$ and the calculated $LOQ$:\n$$M = \\frac{2.00\\,\\text{ng/mL}}{2.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{ng/mL}}$$\n$$M = 100$$\nThe input values have three significant figures. The result of the calculation is exactly $100$. To express this to three significant figures, we write it in scientific notation as $1.00 \\times 10^2$.

The degradation of biological macromolecules such as microRNA (miRNA) is frequently modeled using first-order kinetics, and the concept of half-life is a standard measure in this context. The provided data are consistent and sufficient to derive a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation starting from the first-order rate law. Let $C(t)$ represent the concentration of the miRNA at a given time $t$. For a process following first-order kinetics, the rate of change of the concentration is directly proportional to the concentration itself. The differential rate law for the degradation process is:\n$$-\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = k C(t)$$\nwhere $k$ is the positive first-order rate constant. The negative sign indicates that the concentration decreases over time.\n\nTo find the concentration as a function of time, we must integrate this differential equation. We can rearrange the equation to separate the variables $C$ and $t$:\n$$\\frac{dC(t)}{C(t)} = -k \\, dt$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to a later time $t$. The concentration at $t=0$ is the initial concentration, denoted as $C_0$, and the concentration at time $t$ is $C(t)$.\n$$\\int_{C_0}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C} \\, dC = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt'$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$[\\ln(C)]_{C_0}^{C(t)} = -k[t']_{0}^{t}$$\n$$\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C_0) = -k(t - 0)$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can combine the terms on the left side:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right) = -kt$$\nTo solve for the ratio $\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}$, which represents the fraction of miRNA remaining at time $t$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\\frac{C(t)}{C_0} = \\exp(-kt)$$\nLet $f(t)$ be the fraction of miRNA remaining. Then, $f(t) = \\frac{C(t)}{C_0} = \\exp(-kt)$.\n\nThe problem provides the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, but not the rate constant $k$. We must relate these two quantities. The half-life is defined as the time required for the concentration to decrease to one-half of its initial value. By this definition, at $t = t_{1/2}$, we have $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C_0$.\nSubstituting this into our integrated rate law:\n$$\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}C_0}{C_0} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})$$\nTo solve for $k$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2}$$\n$$-\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2}$$\n$$k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\nThis equation provides the relationship between the first-order rate constant and the half-life.\n\nNow we substitute this expression for $k$ back into the equation for the fraction remaining, $f(t)$:\n$$f(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} t\\right)$$\nUsing the identity $a \\exp(b \\ln(c)) = a c^b$, we can simplify this expression. Here, $\\exp(-x \\ln(y)) = \\exp(\\ln(y^{-x}))=y^{-x}$.\n$$f(t) = \\exp\\left(\\ln(2^{-t/t_{1/2}})\\right) = 2^{-t/t_{1/2}}$$\nAlternatively, this can be written as $f(t) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{t/t_{1/2}}$. This is the general expression for the fraction of substance remaining after time $t$ for a first-order process, given its half-life $t_{1/2}$.\n\nThe problem provides $t_{1/2} = 90$ minutes and asks for the remaining fractions at three specific delay times: $t_1 = 45$ minutes, $t_2 = 90$ minutes, and $t_3 = 180$ minutes.\n\nFor $t = 45$ minutes:\nThe ratio of the delay time to the half-life is $\\frac{t}{t_{1/2}} = \\frac{45}{90} = 0.5$.\nThe fraction remaining is $f(45) = 2^{-0.5} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nNumerically, $f(45) \\approx 0.70710678...$.
