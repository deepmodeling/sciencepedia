Consider an X-ray tube operating at fixed tube potential and fixed milliampere-seconds (milliampere-seconds, $\\mathrm{mAs}$), so that the emitted photon fluence per unit solid angle is unchanged between acquisitions. Assume geometric propagation from a quasi-point source so that the irradiance at the image receptor scales inversely with the square of the source-to-image distance, and neglect attenuation in air and scatter changes between the two distances.

It presents a standard physics problem in the context of dental radiography. We shall proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of three quantities related to a change in the source-to-image distance in an intraoral radiography setup, from an initial distance $d_1 = 20\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ to a final distance $d_2 = 40\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. The tube output (characterized by fixed tube potential and milliampere-seconds, $\\mathrm{mAs}$) is held constant for the first two parts of the problem.\n\n**1. Factor of Exposure Change, $E(d_2)/E(d_1)$**\n\nThe problem states that for a quasi-point source, the irradiance at the image receptor scales inversely with the square of the source-to-image distance, $d$. This is the inverse square law. Let the irradiance be denoted by $I$. Then, its dependence on distance $d$ can be written as:\n$$I(d) \\propto \\frac{1}{d^2}$$\nReceptor exposure, $E$, is defined as being proportional to the incident photon fluence. For a fixed exposure time, which is implicit in the use of a fixed $\\mathrm{mAs}$ setting, the total fluence is proportional to the irradiance. Thus, the exposure $E$ also follows the inverse square law:\n$$E(d) \\propto \\frac{1}{d^2}$$\nWe can express this relationship using a constant of proportionality, $k$, which encapsulates all other factors that are held constant (source output, object attenuation):\n$$E(d) = \\frac{k}{d^2}$$\nTo find the factor by which the exposure changes, we compute the ratio of the exposure at distance $d_2$ to the exposure at distance $d_1$:\n$$\\frac{E(d_2)}{E(d_1)} = \\frac{k/d_2^2}{k/d_1^2} = \\frac{d_1^2}{d_2^2} = \\left(\\frac{d_1}{d_2}\\right)^2$$\nSubstituting the given values $d_1=20$ and $d_2=40$:\n$$\\frac{E(d_2)}{E(d_1)} = \\left(\\frac{20}{40}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThe exposure at the new distance is $1/4$ of the original exposure.\n\n**2. Factor of Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR) Change, $CNR(d_2)/CNR(d_1)$**\n\nThe contrast-to-noise ratio ($CNR$) is defined as $CNR = \\frac{|\\Delta S|}{\\sigma_n}$, where $\\Delta S$ is the signal difference and $\\sigma_n$ is the noise standard deviation.\nThe problem states that the system is quantum-noise limited and that the shot noise follows Poisson statistics. Under these conditions:\n- The signal difference, $\\Delta S$, scales linearly with the mean number of detected photons, $N$. So, $\\Delta S \\propto N$.\n- The noise standard deviation, $\\sigma_n$, scales with the square root of the mean number of detected photons. So, $\\sigma_n \\propto \\sqrt{N}$.\n\nSubstituting these dependencies into the definition of $CNR$:\n$$CNR \\propto \\frac{N}{\\sqrt{N}} = \\sqrt{N}$$\nThe mean number of detected photons, $N$, is directly proportional to the photon fluence incident on the detector, which in turn is proportional to the receptor exposure, $E$. Thus, $N \\propto E$.\nThis leads to the relationship between $CNR$ and exposure $E$:\n$$CNR \\propto \\sqrt{E}$$\nTo find the factor by which the $CNR$ changes, we compute the ratio of the $CNR$ at distance $d_2$ to the $CNR$ at distance $d_1$:\n$$\\frac{CNR(d_2)}{CNR(d_1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E(d_2)}}{\\sqrt{E(d_1)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E(d_2)}{E(d_1)}}$$\nUsing the result from the first part, where we found $\\frac{E(d_2)}{E(d_1)} = \\frac{1}{4}$:\n$$\\frac{CNR(d_2)}{CNR(d_1)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe $CNR$ at the new distance is $1/2$ of the original $CNR$.\n\n**3. Multiplicative Factor for $\\mathrm{mAs}$ to Restore Exposure**\n\nThe total number of X-ray photons emitted by the source is directly proportional to the milliampere-seconds ($\\mathrm{mAs}$) setting. As established in the first part, the exposure $E$ is also proportional to the incident photon fluence, which follows the inverse square law with distance $d$. Combining these dependencies, the exposure $E$ is proportional to the $\\mathrm{mAs}$ value and inversely proportional to the square of the distance:\n$$E \\propto \\frac{\\mathrm{mAs}}{d^2}$$\nLet the initial conditions be $(E_1, \\mathrm{mAs}_1, d_1)$ and the new conditions be $(E_2, \\mathrm{mAs}_2, d_2)$. We want to find the multiplicative factor $\\frac{\\mathrm{mAs}_2}{\\mathrm{mAs}_1}$ required to restore the exposure to its original value, i.e., to make $E_2 = E_1$.\nUsing a constant of proportionality $K$:\n$$E_1 = K \\frac{\\mathrm{mAs}_1}{d_1^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad E_2 = K \\frac{\\mathrm{mAs}_2}{d_2^2}$$\nSetting $E_2 = E_1$:\n$$K \\frac{\\mathrm{mAs}_2}{d_2^2} = K \\frac{\\mathrm{mAs}_1}{d_1^2}$$\nWe can solve for the required ratio of $\\mathrm{mAs}$ values:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{mAs}_2}{\\mathrm{mAs}_1} = \\frac{d_2^2}{d_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{d_2}{d_1}\\right)^2$$\nThis is the exposure maintenance formula. Substituting the given distances $d_1=20$ and $d_2=40$:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{mAs}_2}{\\mathrm{mAs}_1} = \\left(\\frac{40}{20}\\right)^2 = 2^2 = 4$$\nTo maintain the same exposure level when doubling the distance, the $\\mathrm{mAs}$ must be increased by a multiplicative factor of $4$.\n\nThe three requested quantities are $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, and $4$, respectively.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{1}{2} & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4765384"}, {"introduction": "While radiographs are two-dimensional projections, the oral and maxillofacial structures they represent are three-dimensional.

The analysis must rely on first principles of radiographic projection geometry and widely accepted localization rules.\n\nFundamental base:\n- In pinhole projection geometry, points in the object space are mapped to the image receptor along straight lines from the X‑ray source. Image position depends on source-object-receptor geometry and the orientation of the central ray relative to the receptor.\n- Magnification $M$ is approximated by $M \\approx \\dfrac{\\text{source-to-receptor distance}}{\\text{source-to-object distance}}$ for small fields and near-parallel receptor setups.\n- The Same Lingual Opposite Buccal (SLOB) principle states that when the tubehead is moved in a given direction, lingual objects shift on the image in the same direction, while buccal objects shift in the opposite direction. This rule follows from parallax due to differences in source-object distance: buccal objects are closer to the source and exhibit greater apparent motion opposite to tubehead movement.\n\nDefine the geometry and the change:\n- The receptor is fixed and parallel to the tooth long axis.\n- The initial central ray is perpendicular to the receptor.\n- Increasing vertical angulation by $10^\\circ$ means the tubehead is angulated more downward relative to the receptor. In clinical terms, this corresponds to a downward movement of the source (or a downward rotation of the beam) with the central ray still passing through the premolar region.\n\nDirection prediction using SLOB:\n- The tubehead movement associated with increasing positive vertical angulation is downward.\n- According to SLOB, buoyed by parallax, a buccal object (the mental foramen) will move in the opposite direction to the tubehead movement on the image. Therefore, with downward tubehead angulation, the buccal mental foramen will move upward on the image (i.e., superiorly, toward the crowns) relative to a more lingual reference such as the premolar apices. This establishes the correct qualitative direction.\n\nOrder-of-magnitude quantitative estimate using small-angle projection:\nWe estimate the relative superoinferior displacement of the buccal landmark versus the lingual apex due to the $10^\\circ$ change.\n\nAssumptions given:\n- Source-to-receptor distance (SID): $200\\,\\text{mm}$.\n- Source-to-lingual apex distance (SOD for reference): $150\\,\\text{mm}$.\n- Buccal mental foramen is $3\\,\\text{mm}$ closer to the source than the lingual apex. Denote this buccal-lingual depth difference as $d = 3\\,\\text{mm}$ (closer means reduced source-to-object distance by $d$ compared to the lingual apex).\n\nCompute magnification:\n- $M \\approx \\dfrac{200\\,\\text{mm}}{150\\,\\text{mm}} \\approx 1.333$.\n\nUse a small-angle approximation for incremental rotation:\n- When the beam is rotated downward by a small angle $\\Delta \\theta$, a point that is closer to the source by a distance $d$ will undergo an additional apparent vertical displacement on the receptor on the order of $M \\cdot d \\cdot \\Delta \\theta$. This follows from differentials of rigid rotation about a horizontal axis: a rotation by $\\Delta \\theta$ adds a vertical component $\\Delta y \\approx d\\,\\Delta \\theta$ at the object level, which is then scaled by magnification $M$ onto the receptor.\n- Convert $\\Delta \\theta = 10^\\circ$ to radians for computation: $\\Delta \\theta = 10^\\circ \\approx 0.1745\\,\\text{rad}$.\n\nNow compute the magnitude:\n- $\\Delta y \\approx M \\cdot d \\cdot \\Delta \\theta \\approx 1.333 \\times 3\\,\\text{mm} \\times 0.1745 \\approx 0.697\\,\\text{mm}$.\n\nSign:\n- Since the tubehead rotated downward (increasing positive vertical angulation), SLOB dictates the buccal landmark moves upward on the image. Thus the mental foramen shifts superiorly by approximately $0.7\\,\\text{mm}$ relative to the premolar apices.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- A: States a superior (toward crowns) shift of approximately $0.7\\,\\text{mm}$. This matches both the qualitative direction from SLOB (buccal moves opposite tubehead, hence upward) and the quantitative estimate ($\\approx 0.697\\,\\text{mm}$). Verdict: Correct.\n- B: States an inferior (toward apices) shift of approximately $0.7\\,\\text{mm}$. The magnitude is plausible but the direction contradicts SLOB for a buccal object under increased positive vertical angulation.
