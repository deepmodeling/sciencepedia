The provided values are physically realistic for a stomatological CBCT system.\n\nThe geometric relationship in a cone-beam system is governed by the principle of similar triangles. The system consists of a point X-ray source, an object plane, and a detector plane. We assume the detector plane is parallel to the object plane of interest, which in this case is the isocenter plane.\n\nLet the following variables be defined:\n- $SID$: Source-to-Isocenter Distance, the distance from the X-ray source to the center of rotation (isocenter).\n- $SDD$: Source-to-Detector Distance, the distance from the X-ray source to the detector plane.\n- $p_{det}$: The physical pixel pitch of the detector.\n- $FOV_{x}$ and $FOV_{y}$: The dimensions of the Field of View at the isocenter plane.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- $SID = 500~\\text{mm}$\n- $SDD = 800~\\text{mm}$\n- $p_{det} = 0.2~\\text{mm}$\n- $FOV_{x} = 16~\\text{cm} = 160~\\text{mm}$\n- $FOV_{y} = 10~\\text{cm} = 100~\\text{mm}$\n\nFirst, we derive the geometric magnification factor at the isocenter, $M_{iso}$. Magnification is defined as the ratio of the size of an object's projection on the detector to its actual size. Based on similar triangles with vertices at the source, the ratio of the projection size to the object size is equal to the ratio of the source-to-detector distance to the source-to-object distance. For an object located at the isocenter, the source-to-object distance is the $SID$.\n\nTherefore, the magnification at the isocenter is given by:\n$$M_{iso} = \\frac{SDD}{SID}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$M_{iso} = \\frac{800~\\text{mm}}{500~\\text{mm}} = \\frac{8}{5} = 1.6$$\nThis is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nNext, we determine the effective detector sampling projected to the isocenter, $p_{iso}$.

They have distinct effects on patient dose and image contrast.\n\n**Fundamental Concepts:**\n-   **Milliampere-second ($\\mathrm{mAs}$):** This value ($I \\cdot t$) is directly proportional to the total number of electrons accelerated across the X-ray tube. Consequently, it controls the total number of X-ray photons produced, i.e., the **quantity** of the beam.\n-   **Kilovolt peak ($kVp$):** This is the maximum potential difference applied across the tube, determining the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons striking the anode. It primarily controls the energy distribution (spectrum) and maximum energy of the resulting X-ray photons, i.e., the **quality** or penetrability of the beam. The efficiency of X-ray production (bremsstrahlung) is also strongly dependent on electron energy, with the total X-ray output being approximately proportional to $I \\cdot (kVp)^2$.\n-   **Photon Interactions:** In the diagnostic energy range relevant to CBCT ($30$-$90\\ \\mathrm{keV}$), two interactions dominate:\n    1.  **Photoelectric Effect:** An incident photon is completely absorbed, ejecting an inner-shell electron. Its probability is approximately proportional to $Z^3/E^3$, where $Z$ is the atomic number of the absorber and $E$ is the photon energy. This effect is the main source of subject contrast between materials with different $Z$, such as bone ($Z_{eff} \\approx 13.8$) and soft tissue ($Z_{eff} \\approx 7.4$).\n    2.  **Compton Scattering:** An incident photon scatters off a loosely bound outer-shell electron, losing some energy. Its probability has a weaker dependence on $Z$ and energy compared to the photoelectric effect. It contributes to overall attenuation and dose but provides poor subject contrast and degrades images by creating scattered radiation.\n\n**Case 1: Changing $\\mathrm{mAs}$ while Holding $kVp$ Constant**\n-   **Effect on Beam:** Changing the $\\mathrm{mAs}$ directly and proportionally changes the number of X-ray photons generated at all energies within the spectrum. For example, doubling the $\\mathrm{mAs}$ doubles the photon fluence. The shape of the energy spectrum, the average energy, and the maximum energy remain unchanged because $kVp$ is held constant. Thus, only beam **quantity** is altered.\n-   **(i) Effect on Patient Absorbed Dose:** Absorbed dose is the energy deposited per unit mass. Since the number of photons incident on the patient is directly proportional to the $\\mathrm{mAs}$, the absorbed dose is also, to a very good approximation, directly proportional to the $\\mathrm{mAs}$. Doubling the $\\mathrm{mAs}$ will double the patient dose.\n-   **(ii) Effect on Reconstructed Image Contrast:** Subject contrast arises from the difference in the linear attenuation coefficients ($\\mu$) of different tissues. Since the X-ray energy spectrum is unchanged, the values of $\\mu_{bone}(E)$ and $\\mu_{soft\\_tissue}(E)$ remain the same. Therefore, the intrinsic subject contrast, which depends on the difference $\\mu_{bone} - \\mu_{soft\\_tissue}$, does not change. However, increasing the $\\mathrm{mAs}$ increases the number of photons reaching the detector, which reduces quantum noise (mottle) in the reconstructed image. This improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) makes the existing contrast more conspicuous, improving overall image quality.\n\n**Case 2: Changing $kVp$ while Holding $\\mathrm{mAs}$ Constant**\n-   **Effect on Beam:** Increasing the $kVp$ has two major effects. First, it increases the maximum and average energy of the photons, making the beam \"harder\" and more penetrating. Second, because the efficiency of bremsstrahlung production increases roughly as $(kVp)^2$, the total number of photons produced increases substantially, even though the total charge ($\\mathrm{mAs}$) is constant. The shape of the spectrum shifts toward higher energies.\n-   **(i) Effect on Patient Absorbed Dose:** This is a complex interplay. A higher energy beam is more penetrating, meaning a smaller fraction of its energy is deposited per unit path length in tissue. However, this is strongly outweighed by two factors: (1) the significant increase in the total number of photons, and (2) the higher energy carried by each photon. The net result is a substantial increase in patient absorbed dose. An often-cited rule of thumb in radiography states that dose is proportional to $(kVp)^n$ where $n$ can be between $2$ and $5$, depending on filtration and other factors. Therefore, increasing $kVp$ at constant $\\mathrm{mAs}$ considerably increases patient dose.\n-   **(ii) Effect on Reconstructed Image Contrast:** The photoelectric effect, which is the primary source of contrast, is highly sensitive to photon energy ($P.E. \\propto E^{-3}$). As $kVp$ increases, the average beam energy increases. This causes a dramatic reduction in photoelectric interactions relative to Compton scattering across all tissues. Since the photoelectric effect's dependence on atomic number ($Z^3$) is what distinguishes bone from soft tissue, diminishing its role significantly reduces the difference in attenuation between these tissues. Consequently, increasing the $kVp$ results in a **decrease** in subject contrast.\n\n**Summary of Differential Effects:**\n-   **Increasing $\\mathrm{mAs}$ (at constant $kVp$):** Primarily increases beam quantity. This leads to a proportional increase in patient dose and a reduction in image noise (improved SNR), but no change in intrinsic subject contrast.\n-   **Increasing $kVp$ (at constant $\\mathrm{mAs}$):** Increases beam quantity and quality (hardness). This leads to a substantial increase in patient dose and a significant reduction in subject contrast, particularly between bone and soft tissue.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.000 \\times 10^{-2}}$$", "id": "4757228"}, {"introduction": "An ideal scan assumes a perfectly stationary patient, a condition often unmet in clinical practice.

According to the problem's assumptions, we can model the total system blur by calculating the total variance, $\\sigma_{total}^2$, of the system's point spread function ($PSF$) and then converting this variance to an equivalent Gaussian $FWHM$.\n\nThe total variance is the sum of the variances from all independent blur sources. These sources are the intrinsic system components (focal spot, detector, voxelization) and the patient motion.\n$$ \\sigma_{total}^2 = \\sigma_{intrinsic}^2 + \\sigma_{motion}^2 $$\nwhere $\\sigma_{intrinsic}^2$ is the variance of the blur from the stationary system, given by:\n$$ \\sigma_{intrinsic}^2 = \\sigma_{focal}^2 + \\sigma_{detector}^2 + \\sigma_{voxel}^2 $$\n\n**1. Calculation of Intrinsic Blurring Variances**\n\nFirst, we determine the effective width of each blur component in the object space (at the isocenter). The system's magnification at the isocenter is $M = \\frac{SDD}{SAD} = \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{500\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = 2$.\n\n- **Focal Spot Blur ($\\sigma_{focal}^2$)**: The geometric unsharpness from a focal spot of width $f$ creates a penumbra. The width of this blur, $w_{focal}$, at the object plane (isocenter) is determined by similar triangles:\n$$ w_{focal} = f \\left( \\frac{SDD - SAD}{SDD} \\right) = f \\left( 1 - \\frac{SAD}{SDD} \\right) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ w_{focal} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\left( 1 - \\frac{500}{1000} \\right) = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\times 0.5 = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nAssuming this blur has a rectangular profile of width $w_{focal}$, its variance is:\n$$ \\sigma_{focal}^2 = \\frac{w_{focal}^2}{12} = \\frac{(0.25\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2}{12} = \\frac{0.0625}{12}\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 $$\n\n- **Detector Aperture Blur ($\\sigma_{detector}^2$)**: The detector pixel pitch, $p_{det} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, is in the detector plane. Its effective width in the object plane, $w_{det}$, is found by scaling by the inverse of the magnification:\n$$ w_{det} = \\frac{p_{det}}{M} = \\frac{0.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{2} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nThe corresponding variance is:\n$$ \\sigma_{detector}^2 = \\frac{w_{det}^2}{12} = \\frac{(0.1\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2}{12} = \\frac{0.01}{12}\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 $$\n\n- **Voxel Aperture Blur ($\\sigma_{voxel}^2$)**: The reconstruction voxel side length, $v = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, is already defined in object space. So, $w_{voxel} = v = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The variance is:\n$$ \\sigma_{voxel}^2 = \\frac{w_{voxel}^2}{12} = \\frac{(0.2\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2}{12} = \\frac{0.04}{12}\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 $$\n\nNow, the total intrinsic variance is the sum of these components:\n$$ \\sigma_{intrinsic}^2 = \\sigma_{focal}^2 + \\sigma_{detector}^2 + \\sigma_{voxel}^2 = \\frac{1}{12} (0.0625 + 0.01 + 0.04)\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 = \\frac{0.1125}{12}\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 = 0.009375\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 $$\n\n**2. Calculation of Motion-Induced Variance ($\\sigma_{motion}^2$)**\n\nThe motion artifact is modeled as a symmetric two-component mixture, where the final $PSF$ is the average of two identical intrinsic $PSF$s displaced by distance $d$. The $PSF$ for the motion aspect alone can be represented as two delta functions:\n$$ PSF_{motion}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\delta\\left(x + \\frac{d}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\delta\\left(x - \\frac{d}{2}\\right) $$\nThe variance, $\\sigma_{motion}^2$, of this distribution is its second central moment. The mean is $0$ due to symmetry.\n$$ \\sigma_{motion}^2 = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 PSF_{motion}(x) \\,dx - 0^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{motion}^2 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\delta\\left(x + \\frac{d}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\delta\\left(x - \\frac{d}{2}\\right) \\right] \\,dx $$\n$$ \\sigma_{motion}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d^2}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d^2}{4} = \\frac{d^2}{4} $$\nGiven the motion magnitude $d = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{motion}^2 = \\frac{(1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2}{4} = \\frac{2.25}{4}\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 = 0.5625\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 $$\n\n**3. Calculation of Total Equivalent FWHM**\n\nThe total variance of the motion-corrupted system is:\n$$ \\sigma_{total}^2 = \\sigma_{intrinsic}^2 + \\sigma_{motion}^2 = 0.009375\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 + 0.5625\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 = 0.571875\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 $$\nThe problem states we can approximate the overall blur profile as a Gaussian with this total variance. The relationship between the $FWHM$ and the standard deviation $\\sigma$ for a Gaussian distribution is:\n$$ FWHM = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2} \\cdot \\sigma $$\nTherefore, the total equivalent $FWHM$ is:\n$$ FWHM_{total} = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\sigma_{total}^2} = \\sqrt{8\\ln 2 \\cdot \\sigma_{total}^2} $$\n$$ FWHM_{total} = \\sqrt{8\\ln 2 \\cdot 0.571875}\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\approx \\sqrt{5.545177 \\times 0.571875}\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\approx \\sqrt{3.170947}\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\approx 1.780715\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the pre-correction equivalent $FWHM$ is $1.781\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n**4. Qualitative Explanation of Motion Correction**\n\nThe uncorrected motion results in a severe degradation of spatial resolution. The intrinsic $FWHM$ (without motion) is $FWHM_{intrinsic} = \\sqrt{8\\ln 2 \\cdot \\sigma_{intrinsic}^2} \\approx \\sqrt{8\\ln 2 \\cdot 0.009375} \\approx 0.228\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The patient motion increases the effective $FWHM$ to $1.781\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, an almost $8$-fold increase. This extreme blurring would completely obscure fine anatomical structures like a root canal lumen, which might only be a few tenths of a millimeter wide.\n\nPerfect rigid motion correction involves digitally re-registering the projection data. The sudden patient shift of $d$ at mid-rotation displaces the object's representation in all subsequent projection images (from $180^\\circ$ to $360^\\circ$). Motion correction algorithms detect this shift and apply a counter-shift to the affected projection data, effectively translating them back to the positions they would have occupied if no motion had occurred.\n\nBy aligning the second half of the projections with the first half, the entire dataset becomes consistent with that of a single, stationary object. During tomographic reconstruction, the algorithm processes this corrected data as a single coherent set. The two-component mixture $PSF$ model, $PSF_{total}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}[PSF_{intrinsic}(x-d/2) + PSF_{intrinsic}(x+d/2)]$, is no longer applicable. Instead, the correction forces the two displaced components to perfectly overlap. The system's effective $PSF$ reverts to the single, intrinsic $PSF$ of the stationary system, $PSF_{intrinsic}(x)$.\n\nConsequently, the total system variance reduces from $\\sigma_{total}^2$ back to $\\sigma_{intrinsic}^2$. The spatial resolution, as quantified by the $FWHM$, is restored to its optimal intrinsic value of approximately $0.228\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. With this restored resolution, the imaging system is once again capable of resolving structures like the root canal lumen.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.781}$$", "id": "4757143"}]}
