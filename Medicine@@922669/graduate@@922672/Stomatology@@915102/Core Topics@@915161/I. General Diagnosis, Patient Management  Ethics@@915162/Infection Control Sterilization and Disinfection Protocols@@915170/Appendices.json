The available product is labeled as sodium hypochlorite with $5\\%$ available chlorine by mass per volume (that is, $5$ grams of available chlorine per $100$ milliliters), and the target bath concentration is $1{,}000$ parts per million (ppm) available chlorine. Assume aqueous solutions of hypochlorite behave ideally for dilute concentrations so that ppm by mass per volume is approximately milligrams per liter. In the clinic’s validation protocol, contact time is set to achieve a $6$-log reduction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Independent testing of the same product at $20\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ shows that at $C_{\\mathrm{ref}}=5{,}000$ ppm available chlorine a $6$-log reduction is achieved in $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}}=10$ minutes, and over the range $500$ to $5{,}000$ ppm the inactivation follows Chick–Watson kinetics with first-order dependence on concentration (reaction order $n=1$) for this organism–disinfectant pair at fixed temperature.

The steps are grounded in the following foundational elements:\n\n1. Definition of parts per million (ppm) in dilute aqueous solutions: for mass per volume, $1$ ppm $\\approx 1$ milligram per liter, so a concentration of $C$ ppm corresponds to $C$ milligrams per liter.\n2. Mass–volume relation for percent solutions: a label of $5\\%$ available chlorine by mass per volume means $5$ grams of available chlorine per $100$ milliliters, i.e., $50$ grams per liter, which is $50{,}000$ milligrams per liter, i.e., $50{,}000$ ppm.\n3. Dilution is governed by conservation of solute, $C_{1} V_{1} = C_{2} V_{2}$, where $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ are initial and final concentrations and $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ are the corresponding volumes.\n4. Chick–Watson kinetics for disinfection at fixed temperature and target log reduction: $\\ln\\!\\bigl(\\frac{N}{N_{0}}\\bigr) = -k C^{n} t$. For a fixed target $\\log_{10}\\!\\bigl(\\frac{N_{0}}{N}\\bigr)$ and $n=1$, it follows that $C t = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{k} \\log_{10}\\!\\bigl(\\frac{N_{0}}{N}\\bigr)$ is constant; equivalently, $CT = C \\times t$ is constant across conditions that maintain the same log reduction and temperature when $n=1$.\n\nProceed step by step.\n\nFirst, convert the stock to ppm. A $5\\%$ available chlorine solution has $5$ grams per $100$ milliliters. Per liter, this is\n$$\n50~\\mathrm{g/L} = 50{,}000~\\mathrm{mg/L} = 50{,}000~\\text{ppm}.\n$$\nThus, the stock concentration is $C_{\\mathrm{stock}} = 50{,}000$ ppm.\n\nSecond, compute the dilution factor required to achieve the target bath concentration $C_{\\mathrm{target}} = 1{,}000$ ppm. The dilution factor $D$ defined as the ratio of stock concentration to target concentration is\n$$\nD = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{stock}}}{C_{\\mathrm{target}}} = \\frac{50{,}000}{1{,}000} = 50.\n$$\nThis means the total volume is $50$ times the volume of stock. For a notional final volume $V_{2} = 1.000$ liters, the required stock volume is\n$$\nV_{1} = \\frac{V_{2}}{D} = \\frac{1.000~\\mathrm{L}}{50} = 0.02000~\\mathrm{L} = 20.00~\\mathrm{mL},\n$$\nwith the remainder made up by water to reach $1.000$ liters. This establishes the practical dilution but is not the requested final output.\n\nThird, infer the contact time at $1{,}000$ ppm using Chick–Watson kinetics with $n=1$. The reference claim provides $C_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 5{,}000$ ppm and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 10$ minutes for the same $6$-log reduction at $20\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. For $n=1$ and the same log reduction, the $CT$ product is constant:\n$$\nCT = C_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\times \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}}.\n$$\nCompute this reference $CT$:\n$$\nCT = 5{,}000~\\mathrm{mg/L} \\times 10~\\mathrm{min} = 50{,}000~\\mathrm{mg \\cdot min/L}.\n$$\nTherefore, the required contact time at $C_{\\mathrm{target}} = 1{,}000$ ppm is\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{target}} = \\frac{CT}{C_{\\mathrm{target}}} = \\frac{50{,}000~\\mathrm{mg \\cdot min/L}}{1{,}000~\\mathrm{mg/L}} = 50.0~\\mathrm{min},\n$$\nwhich is consistent with the inverse proportionality of time to concentration at fixed log reduction when $n=1$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the single numerical value of the $CT$ required to achieve the $6$-log reduction at $20\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. From the invariance of $CT$ under the stated conditions, the answer is\n$$\nCT = 50{,}000~\\mathrm{mg \\cdot min/L}.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures and expressed in scientific notation, this is\n$$\n5.000 \\times 10^{4}~\\mathrm{mg \\cdot min/L}.\n$$\nPer the instructions, the final boxed answer should be the numeric value without units.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.000 \\times 10^{4}}$$", "id": "4727843"}, {"introduction": "While disinfection reduces microbial load, sterilization aims for its complete elimination, a necessity for critical instruments.

The BD failed because the pack was placed above the drain rather than centered on the top shelf; steam distribution is better at the top.

This is a step-by-step analysis of the data and principles leading to this conclusion.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Bowie-Dick (BD) Test Result**\nThe BD indicator's appearance—a pale center with a dark periphery—is the classic sign of an air pocket trapped within the test pack. The dark periphery indicates that steam reached the required temperature, while the pale center indicates a failure to reach that temperature. This points to inadequate air removal or steam penetration, not insufficient time.\n\n**2. Quantitative Analysis of Chamber Conditions**\nWe must identify the source of the trapped air using the sterilizer log data.\n- **Vacuum Performance:** The minimum pre-vacuum pressure achieved was $p_{\\min} = 60\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$. This is an extremely poor vacuum level for a pre-vacuum sterilizer, which should achieve pressures below $10\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$. A residual pressure of $60\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$ signifies a large mass of air remaining in the chamber before steam admission.\n- **Vacuum Integrity:** The leak rate test revealed a pressure rise of $2\\,\\mathrm{kPa}/\\mathrm{min}$, which exceeds the typical limit (e.g., $1.3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}/\\mathrm{min}$). This confirms that a leak is present, allowing air to enter the chamber during the vacuum phase and contributing to the poor vacuum level.\n- **Effect on Temperature:** According to Dalton's Law, the total pressure in the chamber ($P_{\\mathrm{plateau}} = 304\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$) is the sum of the partial pressures of steam and air ($P_{\\mathrm{total}} = p_{\\mathrm{steam}} + p_{\\mathrm{air}}$). If the residual air ($p_{\\mathrm{air}} \\approx p_{\\min} = 60\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$) is trapped in the center of the pack, the steam's partial pressure there is only $p_{\\mathrm{steam}} = 304\\,\\mathrm{kPa} - 60\\,\\mathrm{kPa} = 244\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$.\n- **Temperature Calculation:** The temperature of saturated steam is determined by its partial pressure. Using linear interpolation between the reference points ($121^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ at $205\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$ and $134^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ at $304\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$), the temperature at $244\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$ is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{sat}} = 121^\\circ \\mathrm{C} + (244\\,\\mathrm{kPa} - 205\\,\\mathrm{kPa}) \\frac{134^\\circ \\mathrm{C} - 121^\\circ \\mathrm{C}}{304\\,\\mathrm{kPa} - 205\\,\\mathrm{kPa}}$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{sat}} = 121 + (39) \\frac{13}{99} \\approx 121 + 5.12 = 126.1\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$$\nThis temperature is significantly below the required $134\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, which explains the failed BD test.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Corrective Actions**\n- **Option A** correctly identifies the root cause as air evacuation failure due to poor vacuum performance and a vacuum leak. The proposed corrective actions—performing a leak test, inspecting seals, and servicing the vacuum system to achieve a proper vacuum level ($p_{\\min} \\leq 20\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$)—directly address these identified issues.\n- **Option B** is incorrect because the BD test is designed to be independent of exposure time. The issue is a failure to reach temperature, which more time cannot fix.\n- **Option C** is incorrect because the steam quality ($\\chi=0.96$) is within acceptable limits, whereas the vacuum data shows a gross failure.\n- **Option D** is incorrect because placing the pack above the drain is the standard, correct procedure for a robust test. Moving it would mask the problem.\n- **Option E** is incorrect because while NCGs in steam contribute to the problem, the amount of residual air from the failed evacuation ($60\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$) is far greater than the NCGs from the steam supply ($1.5\\%$). The primary fault is with the sterilizer's vacuum system.\n\nTherefore, the evidence overwhelmingly points to a failure in the sterilizer's vacuum system, making option A the only appropriate diagnosis and plan of action.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4727919"}]}
