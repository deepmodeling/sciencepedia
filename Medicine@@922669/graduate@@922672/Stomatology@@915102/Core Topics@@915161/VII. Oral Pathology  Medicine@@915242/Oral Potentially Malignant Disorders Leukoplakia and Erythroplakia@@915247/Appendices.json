Do not introduce or use any external shortcut formulas beyond what can be derived from the definition of point prevalence and standard probability rules, and do not round any intermediate quantities.", "solution": "### Derivation of the Expected Count\n\nThe expected count of cases is derived from the definition of point prevalence using first principles of probability theory.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of individuals in the closed population, where $N = 500,000$.\nLet $p$ be the point prevalence of leukoplakia, given as $p = 0.02$.\n\nBy its definition in the problem statement, point prevalence is \"the proportion of individuals in the population who have the condition\". This can be interpreted probabilistically. If we select a single individual at random from the population, the probability that this individual has leukoplakia is equal to the prevalence, $p$.\n\nTo formalize this, we can model the status of each individual in the population with a random variable. Let us define a set of independent and identically distributed random variables $X_i$ for each individual $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, N\\}$. Each $X_i$ is a Bernoulli random variable where:\n- $X_i = 1$ if individual $i$ has leukoplakia.\n- $X_i = 0$ if individual $i$ does not have leukoplakia.\n\nThe probability of \"success\" (an individual having leukoplakia) for each trial is given by the point prevalence, $p$. Thus, for any individual $i$:\n$$ P(X_i = 1) = p $$\n$$ P(X_i = 0) = 1 - p $$\n\nThe total number of individuals with leukoplakia in the population, which we denote as $C$, is the sum of these individual random variables:\n$$ C = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i $$\n\nThe problem asks for the *expected count* of cases. This is the expected value of the random variable $C$, denoted $E[C]$. Using the property of linearity of expectation, the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations:\n$$ E[C] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i] $$\n\nThe expected value of a single Bernoulli random variable $X_i$ with probability of success $p$ is, by definition:\n$$ E[X_i] = (1 \\cdot P(X_i = 1)) + (0 \\cdot P(X_i = 0)) = (1 \\cdot p) + (0 \\cdot (1-p)) = p $$\n\nSince all $X_i$ are identically distributed, $E[X_i] = p$ for all $i$. Substituting this result back into the expression for $E[C]$:\n$$ E[C] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p $$\n\nThis is a sum of the constant $p$ over $N$ terms, which simplifies to:\n$$ E[C] = N \\cdot p $$\n\nThis derivation rigorously establishes that the expected number of cases is the product of the total population size and the point prevalence. Now, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$ N = 500,000 $$\n$$ p = 0.02 $$\n\nThe expected count is:\n$$ E[C] = 500,000 \\times 0.02 $$\n$$ E[C] = 500,000 \\times \\frac{2}{100} $$\n$$ E[C] = 5,000 \\times 2 $$\n$$ E[C] = 10,000 $$\n\nThe expected count of leukoplakia cases in this population is $10,000$ persons. This is an exact integer as required.\n\n### Qualitative Explanation of Stratification\n\nThe problem asks for a qualitative explanation of how stratifying the population by risk habits would modulate the population-level prevalence estimate, based on the law of total probability.\n\nLet $L$ be the event that a randomly chosen individual has leukoplakia. The overall population prevalence is $p = P(L)$. Let us partition the entire population into $k$ mutually exclusive and exhaustive strata, $S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_k$, based on combinations of risk habits (e.g., non-smokers with no alcohol use, smokers with heavy alcohol use, etc.). The condition that these strata partition the population means that every individual belongs to exactly one stratum.\n\nThe law of total probability states that the probability of an event ($L$) can be calculated by summing the conditional probabilities of that event given each partition, weighted by the probability of each partition occurring. Formally:\n$$ P(L) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} P(L | S_j) P(S_j) $$\n\nLet's translate this formula into the terminology of epidemiology:\n- $P(S_j)$ is the proportion of the total population that belongs to stratum $S_j$. Let's call this the stratum weight, $w_j$.\n- $P(L | S_j)$ is the conditional probability of having leukoplakia given that an individual is in stratum $S_j$. This is, by definition, the stratum-specific prevalence, which we can denote as $p_j$.\n\nSubstituting these terms, the overall population prevalence $p$ is expressed as a weighted average of the stratum-specific prevalences:\n$$ p = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} p_j w_j $$\n\nThe significance of this relationship is that it \"modulates\" the population-level estimate by revealing its underlying composition. It is well-established that habits such as tobacco smoking and heavy alcohol use are major risk factors for leukoplakia. This means that the stratum-specific prevalences, $p_j$, will vary dramatically. A stratum of individuals with multiple risk factors (e.g., $S_{\\text{high_risk}}$) will have a much higher prevalence, $p_{\\text{high_risk}}$, than a stratum of individuals with no risk factors, $p_{\\text{low_risk}}$.\n\nThus, the overall prevalence $p$ is not a uniform risk applied to all individuals but is a composite figure. It is heavily influenced by two factors for each stratum: the prevalence within that stratum ($p_j$) and the relative size of that stratum within the total population ($w_j$). For example, if a population has a large proportion of individuals in high-risk strata (large $w_j$ for high $p_j$), the overall population prevalence $p$ will be higher than in a population with a smaller proportion of high-risk individuals, even if the stratum-specific prevalences were identical between the two populations. This formalizes how the distribution of risk factors within a population directly determines its overall disease burden.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10000}$$", "id": "4744641"}, {"introduction": "After establishing the prevalence of OPMDs, the next critical question is identifying the risk factors that contribute to their development.

An $\\mathrm{OR}  1$ indicates a positive association (increased odds of outcome with exposure), and an $\\mathrm{OR}  1$ indicates a negative or protective association.\n\nOur calculated odds ratio is $\\mathrm{OR} = 3.50$. This value is substantially greater than $1$. The interpretation is that the odds of being a current tobacco user are $3.5$ times higher for individuals with oral leukoplakia compared to those without the condition. Within the framework of causal inference, such as the Bradford Hill criteria, the \"strength of association\" is a key consideration. An odds ratio of $3.50$ is generally considered to represent a moderate to strong association. A strong association makes random error or confounding less likely, although not impossible, explanations for the finding.\n\nWhile a single case-control study cannot definitively prove causation (as it does not establish temporality and is susceptible to biases like selection and recall bias), a strong association significantly enhances the etiologic plausibility of tobacco as a causal factor for oral leukoplakia. It provides compelling evidence that supports the hypothesis that tobacco use contributes to the development of this oral potentially malignant disorder. This finding would justify further investigation through other study designs (e.g., cohort studies) and laboratory research to establish a full causal link.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.50}\n$$", "id": "4744612"}, {"introduction": "Bridging the gap from population-level data to the individual patient, this practice addresses a critical challenge in clinical diagnostics: sampling error.

Since the biopsy location is uniformly random over the entire lesion area, the probability of this event is equal to the fraction of the total area occupied by the dysplastic subregion.\n$$ P(S) = f $$\nConversely, let $S^c$ be the complementary event that a single biopsy *misses* the dysplastic subregion. The probability of this event is:\n$$ P(S^c) = 1 - P(S) = 1 - f $$\nWe are performing $k$ independent biopsies. Let $D$ be the event that severe dysplasia is detected. According to the problem statement, detection occurs if *at least one* of the $k$ biopsies samples from the dysplastic subregion.\n\nIt is more tractable to first calculate the probability of the complementary event, $D^c$, which is the event that severe dysplasia is *not* detected. This occurs if and only if *all* $k$ biopsies miss the dysplastic subregion. Let $S_i$ be the event that the $i$-th biopsy samples from the dysplastic region, for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, k$. Then the event $D^c$ is the intersection of the events where each biopsy misses:\n$$ D^c = S_1^c \\cap S_2^c \\cap \\dots \\cap S_k^c $$\nThe problem states that the biopsies are independent. By the definition of independence, the probability of the intersection of independent events is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$ P(D^c) = P(S_1^c) \\times P(S_2^c) \\times \\dots \\times P(S_k^c) $$\nSince $P(S_i^c) = 1 - f$ for all $i$, we have:\n$$ P(D^c) = (1 - f) \\times (1 - f) \\times \\dots \\times (1 - f) \\quad (k \\text{ times}) $$\n$$ P(D^c) = (1 - f)^k $$\nThe probability of detection, $P$, is the probability of the event $D$. Since $D$ and $D^c$ are complementary events, their probabilities sum to $1$:\n$$ P(D) + P(D^c) = 1 $$\nTherefore, the expression for the probability of detection is:\n$$ P = P(D) = 1 - P(D^c) = 1 - (1 - f)^k $$\nThis is the general expression for the probability of detection as a function of the dysplastic fraction $f$ and the number of biopsies $k$.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nNext, we compute the numeric value of $P$ for the given parameters $f = 0.25$ and $k = 4$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ P = 1 - (1 - 0.25)^4 $$\n$$ P = 1 - (0.75)^4 $$\nWe can express $0.75$ as the fraction $\\frac{3}{4}$:\n$$ P = 1 - \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^4 $$\n$$ P = 1 - \\frac{3^4}{4^4} $$\n$$ P = 1 - \\frac{81}{256} $$\n$$ P = \\frac{256}{256} - \\frac{81}{256} = \\frac{256 - 81}{256} = \\frac{175}{256} $$\nTo obtain the decimal value, we perform the division:\n$$ P = \\frac{175}{256} \\approx 0.68359375 $$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.
