It presents a clear, self-contained, and scientifically grounded question in the field of epidemiological modeling, requiring the application of a specified logistic regression model to calculate a patient's risk probability for oral submucous fibrosis based on their exposure history. All necessary parameters and definitions are provided.\n\nThe objective is to compute the cumulative areca exposure for a given patient, use this value in the provided log-odds model to determine the probability $p$ of clinically significant oral submucous fibrosis, and classify the patient's risk level.\n\nFirst, we calculate the patient's cumulative areca exposure in quid-years. The definition provided is the product of the average number of quids chewed per day and the total duration of the habit in years.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of quids chewed per day and $T$ be the duration in years. The cumulative exposure, $E$, is:\n$$E = N \\times T$$\nGiven $N=10$ quids/day and $T=8$ years, the cumulative exposure is:\n$$E = 10 \\times 8 = 80 \\text{ quid-years}$$\n\nNext, we must prepare this exposure value for the risk model. The model's independent variable, $x$, represents the cumulative exposure measured in tens of quid-years. Therefore, we must scale the calculated exposure $E$:\n$$x = \\frac{E}{10} = \\frac{80}{10} = 8$$\nSo, the input variable for the model is $x=8$.\n\nThe problem states that the log-odds of the disease, denoted $\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)$, increases linearly with $x$.
