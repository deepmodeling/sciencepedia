The staging will be performed according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition criteria for oral cavity carcinoma.\n\nThe given parameters for the tumor are:\n1.

Absence of invasion into advanced structures, which precludes an automatic classification of T4a or T4b based on local extension. Specifically, the problem states there is no invasion of cortical bone, maxillary sinus, skin, extrinsic tongue muscles, masticator space, pterygoid plates, skull base, or encasement of the internal carotid artery.\n\nFirst, for a consistent comparison against the AJCC thresholds, we must express both dimensions in the same units.

Thus, this clause is false.\n    2.  Clause 2: $20 \\, \\text{mm} < S \\le 40 \\, \\text{mm}$ AND $D \\le 10 \\, \\text{mm}$.\n        Let's check the first part of this AND statement: $20 \\, \\text{mm} < 32 \\, \\text{mm} \\le 40 \\, \\text{mm}$.

This is also true.\n        Since both parts of the second clause are true, the entire clause is true. As the T2 definition is a logical OR, and we have found one true clause, the tumor meets the criteria for T2.\n\nTherefore, the correct $T$ category for the primary tumor is T2.\n\nThe final step is to apply the given coding function $I(T)$ to this result.

This manual is the international standard for cancer staging. The concepts of greatest dimension and depth of invasion (DOI) are standard pathologic measurements, and the provided values are clinically realistic.

A unique, meaningful solution exists.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem statement is expressed in precise, objective medical language. The inputs are quantitative measurements, and the staging system is a formal, rule-based classification. The problem is free from subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be formulated based on the provided data and the AJCC 8th Edition staging criteria.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe T-category for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma in the AJCC 8th Edition is determined by the primary tumor's size (greatest dimension) and its depth of invasion (DOI). The problem states that there is no invasion into adjacent structures, which precludes a T4a or T4b classification. Therefore, we must distinguish between T1, T2, and T3 based on size and DOI.\n\nThe relevant definitions from the AJCC 8th Edition are as follows:\n-   **T1:** Tumor $\\le 2 \\text{ cm}$ in greatest dimension AND depth of invasion $\\le 5 \\text{ mm}$.\n-   **T2:** Tumor $> 2 \\text{ cm}$ but $\\le 4 \\text{ cm}$ in greatest dimension and depth of invasion $\\le 10 \\text{ mm}$, OR tumor $\\le 2 \\text{ cm}$ in greatest dimension and depth of invasion $> 5 \\text{ mm}$ but $\\le 10 \\text{ mm}$.\n-   **T3:** Tumor $> 4 \\text{ cm}$ in greatest dimension OR any tumor with depth of invasion $> 10 \\text{ mm}$.\n\nThe problem provides the following measurements for the tumor in question:\n-   Greatest surface dimension $= 2.0 \\text{ cm}$\n-   Depth of invasion (DOI) $= 5 \\text{ mm}$\n\nThis is a boundary case, requiring strict interpretation of the inequalities in the definitions.\n\n1.  **Evaluate for T1:**\n    The criteria for T1 are:\n    (a) greatest dimension $\\le 2 \\text{ cm}$\n    (b) DOI $\\le 5 \\text{ mm}$\n\n    The given tumor has a greatest dimension of $2.0 \\text{ cm}$. Since $2.0 \\le 2$, condition (a) is satisfied.\n    The given tumor has a DOI of $5 \\text{ mm}$. Since $5 \\le 5$, condition (b) is also satisfied.\n    Because both conditions are met, the tumor qualifies as T1.\n\n2.  **Evaluate for T2 (for completeness):**\n    The criteria for T2 are a logical disjunction (OR) of two conditions:\n    (a) (dimension $> 2 \\text{ cm}$ AND dimension $\\le 4 \\text{ cm}$) AND (DOI $\\le 10 \\text{ mm}$)\n    OR\n    (b) (dimension $\\le 2 \\text{ cm}$) AND (DOI $> 5 \\text{ mm}$ AND DOI $\\le 10 \\text{ mm}$)\n\n    Let's check condition (a). The tumor's dimension is $2.0 \\text{ cm}$. The statement \"$2.0 > 2$\" is false. Therefore, condition (a) is not met.\n    Let's check condition (b). The tumor's DOI is $5 \\text{ mm}$. The statement \"$5 > 5$\" is false. Therefore, condition (b) is not met.\n    Since neither of the conditions for T2 is met, the tumor is not T2.\n\n3.  **Evaluate for T3 (for completeness):**\n    The criteria for T3 are:\n    (a) dimension $> 4 \\text{ cm}$\n    OR\n    (b) DOI $> 10 \\text{ mm}$\n\n    The tumor's dimension is $2.0 \\text{ cm}$, which is not $> 4 \\text{ cm}$.\n    The tumor's DOI is $5 \\text{ mm}$, which is not $> 10 \\text{ mm}$.\n    Since neither condition is met, the tumor is not T3.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the tumor rigorously meets the criteria for T1 and fails to meet the criteria for T2 or T3. The crucial point is the interpretation of the \"less than or equal to\" ($\\le$) and \"greater than\" ($>$) operators. A measurement exactly on the boundary value (e.g., $5 \\text{ mm}$ DOI) falls into the category defined by \"$\\le 5 \\text{ mm}$\" (T1), not the one defined by \"$> 5 \\text{ mm}$\" (which would upstage to T2).\n\nTherefore, the correct primary tumor category is T1.\n\nThe problem asks to encode this result as an integer $c$, where $c=1$ corresponds to T1.

Do not round.", "solution": "We proceed from foundational and widely accepted definitions in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) eighth edition for oral cavity cancer. The tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system defines primary tumor category ($T$) by local extent of disease, including size, depth of invasion, and invasion into adjacent structures; nodal category ($N$) by number, laterality, size of involved cervical lymph nodes, and the presence or absence of extranodal extension (ENE); and metastasis category ($M$) by the presence or absence of distant metastasis.\n\nStep $1$: Determine $T$ from core definitions. For oral cavity primaries, per AJCC eighth edition, invasion through the cortical bone of the mandible or maxilla constitutes moderately advanced local disease and defines $T4a$ irrespective of the exact size threshold, provided the invasion includes cortical breakthrough (and typically medullary invasion). The given primary tumor is a mandibular gingival squamous cell carcinoma with documented cortical breakthrough and medullary invasion. Therefore, based strictly on the definition of $T4a$ as invasion through cortical bone of the mandible, the appropriate pathologic $T$ category is $T4a$. It is not $T4b$, which would require invasion of the masticator space, pterygoid plates, skull base, or encasement of the internal carotid artery, none of which are present in the scenario.\n\nThus, $T = T4a$.\n\nStep $2$: Determine $N$ from core definitions. The AJCC eighth edition differentiates nodal categories by size, number, laterality, and extranodal extension. For pathologic classification:\n- $pN1$ corresponds to a single ipsilateral lymph node $\\leq 3\\ \\text{cm}$ in greatest dimension without extranodal extension (ENE negative).\n- $pN2$ subcategories (such as $pN2a$, $pN2b$, $pN2c$) apply to multiple nodes or single nodes $> 3\\ \\text{cm}$ and $\\leq 6\\ \\text{cm}$, all without ENE.\n- $pN3a$ corresponds to a lymph node $> 6\\ \\text{cm}$ without ENE.\n- $pN3b$ corresponds to any nodal disease with pathologic extranodal extension (ENE positive), including a single ipsilateral node $\\leq 3\\ \\text{cm}$ with ENE, a single ipsilateral node $> 3\\ \\text{cm}$ and $\\leq 6\\ \\text{cm}$ with ENE, multiple ipsilateral nodes with ENE, or contralateral/bilateral nodes with ENE.\n\nIn the present case, there is a single ipsilateral level II node measuring $2.7\\ \\text{cm}$ with pathologic extranodal extension (pENE). Because the node has ENE, the correct pathologic nodal category is $pN3b$ even though the greatest dimension is $\\leq 3\\ \\text{cm}$, due to the rule that ENE positivity escalates to $N3b$ under pathologic criteria.\n\nThus, $N = N3b$ (pathologic).\n\nStep $3$: Determine $M$ from core definitions. The absence of distant metastasis clinically and radiographically corresponds to $M0$.\n\nThus, $M = M0$.\n\nStep $4$: Determine the AJCC stage group. For oral cavity cancers in the AJCC eighth edition, the stage grouping rules include:\n- Stage $\\text{IVA}$ includes $T4a$ with $N0$ to $N2$ and $M0$, as well as $T1$ to $T3$ with $N2$ and $M0$.\n- Stage $\\text{IVB}$ includes any $T$ with $N3$ and $M0$, or $T4b$ with any $N$ and $M0$.\n- Stage $\\text{IVC}$ includes any $T$, any $N$ with $M1$.\n\nGiven $T4a$, $N3b$, and $M0$, the presence of $N3$ places the disease into stage $\\text{IVB}$ regardless of the $T$ subcategory (as long as $M0$ holds).\n\nTherefore, the final AJCC stage group is stage $\\text{IVB}$.\n\nStep $5$: Encode the categories and compute the scalar $E$ using the provided mapping and formula.
