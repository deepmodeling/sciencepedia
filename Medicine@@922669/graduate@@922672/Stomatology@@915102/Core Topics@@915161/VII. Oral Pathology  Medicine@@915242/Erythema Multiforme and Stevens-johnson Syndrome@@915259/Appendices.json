Three days prior, the child had a febrile episode followed by grouped vesicles on the vermilion border, and polymerase chain reaction confirms Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) type $1$. Cutaneous examination reveals symmetrically distributed, acral, well-defined “typical target” lesions with three concentric zones and central dusky necrosis. There is no positive Nikolsky sign and no areas of epidermal detachment; the estimated detached body surface area is $p = 0\\%$. Two mucosal sites are involved, so $m = 2$ (oral and ocular). No new medications were started in the preceding $8$ weeks. \n\nUsing fundamental clinical classification principles for erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), determine which diagnosis best fits this presentation and justify it by explicitly analyzing how the threshold of epidermal detachment integrates with lesion morphology and mucosal involvement. In accepted classification systems, the role of detached body surface area $p$ is central to distinguishing SJS and TEN, with thresholds of $p  10\\%$ for SJS, $10\\% \\leq p \\leq 30\\%$ for SJS/TEN overlap, and $p > 30\\%$ for TEN. Erythema multiforme minor is characterized by typical target lesions with $m = 0$, while erythema multiforme major includes typical target lesions with $m \\geq 1$ and may have limited or no epidermal detachment. Choose the single best option.\n\nA. Classify as erythema multiforme (EM) major; the presence of typical target lesions, HSV association, $m = 2$, and $p = 0\\%$ supports EM major rather than SJS.\n\nB.

Classify as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN); ocular involvement implies TEN even with $p = 0\\%$.\n\nD. Classify as erythema multiforme (EM) minor; $p = 0\\%$ indicates minor disease despite $m = 2$.", "solution": "Begin from core definitions that separate erythema multiforme (EM) from Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN):\n\n1. Erythema Multiforme (EM) is a hypersensitivity reaction most commonly triggered by infection, classically Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV). EM is characterized by “typical target” lesions with at least three zones and an acral predominance. The distinction between EM minor and EM major is based on mucosal involvement: EM minor has $m = 0$, and EM major has $m \\geq 1$; epidermal detachment in EM is absent or limited and not used to grade severity by body surface area.\n\n2. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) are typically severe, medication-induced reactions with “flat atypical targets” or purpuric macules, widespread epidermal necrosis, positive Nikolsky sign, and the diagnostic classification hinges on the percentage of detached body surface area $p$: SJS has $p  10\\%$, SJS/TEN overlap has $10\\% \\leq p \\leq 30\\%$, and TEN has $p > 30\\%$. By definition, epidermal detachment is present in SJS/TEN and is not optional; it is a central diagnostic threshold.\n\nApply these principles to the vignette:\n\n- The patient has confirmed HSV type $1$ preceding the eruption, favoring EM rather than a drug reaction typical of SJS/TEN.\n- Lesion morphology is “typical target,” with three concentric zones and acral distribution, matching EM, not the flat atypical targets of SJS/TEN.\n- Mucosal involvement $m = 2$ (oral and ocular) supports EM major rather than EM minor.\n- The detached body surface area $p = 0\\%$ excludes SJS/TEN because those entities require epidermal detachment; a value of $p = 0\\%$ cannot satisfy $p  10\\%$ for SJS unless there is actual detachment. In other words, the threshold intervals for SJS/TEN presuppose nonzero detachment; $p = 0\\%$ indicates absence of detachment, which is incompatible with the defining pathology of SJS/TEN.\n\nTherefore, the constellation of HSV association, typical target morphology, $m = 2$, and $p = 0\\%$ supports EM major.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Classify as erythema multiforme (EM) major; the presence of typical target lesions, HSV association, $m = 2$, and $p = 0\\%$ supports EM major rather than SJS. This option correctly integrates etiology (HSV), morphology (typical targets), mucosal count $m \\geq 1$, and the role of $p$ (non-detachment), concluding EM major. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. Classify as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS); involvement of $m = 2$ mucosal sites defines SJS regardless of $p$. This reflects a common misconception. SJS is not defined by the number of mucosal sites alone; it requires epidermal detachment ($p > 0\\%$) and typically flat atypical targets or widespread purpura. With $p = 0\\%$ and typical targets, SJS is not supported. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. Classify as Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN); ocular involvement implies TEN even with $p = 0\\%$. TEN requires extensive epidermal detachment $p > 30\\%$. Ocular involvement can occur in EM major and SJS/TEN, but is not diagnostic of TEN. With $p = 0\\%$, TEN is excluded. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Classify as erythema multiforme (EM) minor; $p = 0\\%$ indicates minor disease despite $m = 2$. EM minor is defined by absence of mucosal involvement ($m = 0$). Here $m = 2$, so EM minor is excluded. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nConclude that EM major is the best-fit diagnosis by first principles of classification: etiology (HSV), morphology (typical targets), mucosal involvement ($m \\geq 1$), and detachment threshold ($p = 0\\%$ excludes SJS/TEN).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4716459"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis of a severe cutaneous adverse reaction like SJS is suspected, identifying the causative drug is a critical next step for immediate management and future prevention.
