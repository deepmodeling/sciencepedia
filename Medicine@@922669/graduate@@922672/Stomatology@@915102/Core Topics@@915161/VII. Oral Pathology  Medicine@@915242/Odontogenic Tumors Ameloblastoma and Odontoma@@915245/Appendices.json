For an initial probabilistic diagnostic model restricted to two mutually exclusive odontogenic tumor categories—ameloblastoma (denote the event by $A$) and odontoma (denote the event by $O$)—the clinic’s tumor registry provides prior probabilities $P(A)=0.30$ and $P(O)=0.70$ for referrals with mandibular lesions.

Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nLet the following events be defined:\n$A$: The patient has an ameloblastoma.\n$O$: The patient has an odontoma.\n$M$: The radiological findings include multilocular radiolucency.\n$R$: The radiological findings include root resorption.\n$B$: The conjunction of the two observed features, i.e., $B = M \\cap R$.\n\nThe problem provides the following prior probabilities for the two mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories within the model:\n$$P(A) = 0.30$$\n$$P(O) = 0.70$$\nNote that $P(A) + P(O) = 0.30 + 0.70 = 1.00$, which is consistent with the problem's constraint that these are the only two possibilities.\n\nThe problem also provides the conditional probabilities (likelihoods) of observing each feature, given the tumor type:\n$$P(M \\mid A) = 0.72$$\n$$P(R \\mid A) = 0.58$$\n$$P(M \\mid O) = 0.06$$\n$$P(R \\mid O) = 0.12$$\n\nA crucial piece of information is the assumption of conditional independence of the imaging features given the tumor category. This means that for a given tumor type, the probability of observing both features is the product of their individual probabilities. Mathematically:\n$$P(M \\cap R \\mid A) = P(M \\mid A) \\times P(R \\mid A)$$\n$$P(M \\cap R \\mid O) = P(M \\mid O) \\times P(R \\mid O)$$\n\nOur objective is to compute the posterior probability of the tumor being an ameloblastoma, given that both features have been observed. This is denoted by $P(A \\mid B)$, where $B = M \\cap R$.\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, $P(B \\mid A) P(A)$. The term $P(B \\mid A)$ is the likelihood of observing both features given that the tumor is an ameloblastoma. Using the conditional independence assumption:\n$$P(B \\mid A) = P(M \\cap R \\mid A) = P(M \\mid A) \\times P(R \\mid A) = 0.72 \\times 0.58 = 0.4176$$\nThe numerator is then:\n$$P(B \\mid A) P(A) = 0.4176 \\times 0.30 = 0.12528$$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, $P(B)$, which is the total probability of observing both features. This is calculated using the law of total probability, summing over all possible tumor types (in this case, $A$ and $O$):\n$$P(B) = P(B \\mid A) P(A) + P(B \\mid O) P(O)$$\nWe have already calculated the first term, $P(B \\mid A) P(A) = 0.12528$. We now calculate the second term. First, we find the likelihood $P(B \\mid O)$:\n$$P(B \\mid O) = P(M \\cap R \\mid O) = P(M \\mid O) \\times P(R \\mid O) = 0.06 \\times 0.12 = 0.0072$$\nThe second term is then:\n$$P(B \\mid O) P(O) = 0.0072 \\times 0.70 = 0.00504$$\nNow, we can find the total probability $P(B)$:\n$$P(B) = 0.12528 + 0.00504 = 0.13032$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerator and denominator back into Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability $P(A \\mid B)$:\n$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{0.12528}{0.13032} \\approx 0.9613267...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(A \\mid B) \\approx 0.9613$$\nThis is the posterior probability that the patient has an ameloblastoma, given the observation of both multilocular radiolucency and root resorption.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9613}$$", "id": "4741193"}, {"introduction": "After establishing a likely diagnosis of ameloblastoma, the focus shifts to surgical planning, where the goal is complete tumor removal with an adequate safety margin. This exercise translates abstract oncologic principles into tangible, three-dimensional consequences by using fundamental geometric principles to model the tumor and its resection margins.

It is a direct application of solid geometry to a realistic problem in surgical oncology.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the volume of bone resected as a surgical margin around a tumor approximated as a sphere. We are given the fundamental definition for the volume of a sphere and must proceed from first principles.\n\nLet the tumor be modeled as a sphere of radius $r$. The volume of a sphere is given by the fundamental formula $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (\\text{radius})^3$. Therefore, the volume of the tumor itself, denoted as $V_{lesion}$, is:\n$$V_{lesion} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$$\n\nThe surgical plan involves a segmental resection with a uniform bony margin of width $m$ in all directions. The primary geometric assumption required is to interpret this clinical directive mathematically. For a spherical lesion, adding a uniform margin $m$ in all directions results in a larger, concentric sphere. The radius of this total resection sphere, $R_{total}$, is the sum of the lesion's radius and the margin's width.\n$$R_{total} = r + m$$\n\nThe volume of this total resection sphere, $V_{total}$, which includes both the lesion and the margin, is therefore:\n$$V_{total} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (R_{total})^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (r+m)^3$$\n\nThe question asks for the expression for the added resection volume attributable *solely* to the margin. This volume, which we will denote as $V_{margin}$, is the volume of the spherical shell surrounding the tumor. It is calculated by subtracting the volume of the lesion from the total resected volume.\n$$V_{margin} = V_{total} - V_{lesion}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $V_{total}$ and $V_{lesion}$:\n$$V_{margin} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (r+m)^3 - \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$$\n\nThis is the general expression for the added resection volume. To elucidate the relationship, we can factor out the common term $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$:\n$$V_{margin} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left[ (r+m)^3 - r^3 \\right]$$\n\nTo further analyze, we can expand the cubic term $(r+m)^3 = r^3 + 3r^2m + 3rm^2 + m^3$. Substituting this into the expression for $V_{margin}$:\n$$V_{margin} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left[ (r^3 + 3r^2m + 3rm^2 + m^3) - r^3 \\right]$$\n$$V_{margin} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (3r^2m + 3rm^2 + m^3)$$\nThis final derived form explicitly shows how the added volume depends on the original lesion radius $r$ and the margin width $m$.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the specific case provided: a lesion with mean radius $r=2.2\\,\\text{cm}$ and a surgical margin $m=1.5\\,\\text{cm}$.\nFirst, calculate the radius of the total resection sphere:\n$$R_{total} = r + m = 2.2\\,\\text{cm} + 1.5\\,\\text{cm} = 3.7\\,\\text{cm}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the values of $r$ and $m$ (or $r$ and $R_{total}$) into the derived formula for $V_{margin}$:\n$$V_{margin} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left[ (3.7)^3 - (2.2)^3 \\right]$$\n\nWe compute the values of the cubic terms:\n$$(3.7)^3 = 50.653$$\n$$(2.2)^3 = 10.648$$\n\nThe units for these volumes are $\\text{cm}^3$. Now, we calculate the difference:\n$$V_{margin} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (50.653 - 10.648)\\,\\text{cm}^3$$\n$$V_{margin} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (40.005)\\,\\text{cm}^3$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value:\n$$V_{margin} \\approx 1.33333... \\times 3.14159... \\times 40.005\\,\\text{cm}^3$$\n$$V_{margin} \\approx 167.57317\\,\\text{cm}^3$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $7$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$V_{margin} \\approx 167.6\\,\\text{cm}^3$$\n\nRegarding the implications for reconstructive planning, the magnitude of this added volume is substantial. For comparison, the volume of the lesion itself is $V_{lesion} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (2.2)^3 \\approx 44.6\\,\\text{cm}^3$. The margin volume ($167.6\\,\\text{cm}^3$) is nearly four times the volume of the tumor itself. A total resected volume of $V_{total} = V_{lesion} + V_{margin} \\approx 44.6 + 167.6 = 212.2\\,\\text{cm}^3$ in the mandible represents a massive structural defect. Such a defect is considered a critical-sized defect, far exceeding the capacity of bone for spontaneous regeneration. Consequently, simple reconstruction with a passive plate or non-vascularized bone grafts would be insufficient and destined for failure (e.g., hardware fracture, infection, non-union). The large calculated volume necessitates a complex reconstruction using a vascularized composite free flap, most commonly a fibula free flap, which brings a new blood supply and sufficient bone stock to restore mandibular continuity, function, and aesthetics.

Starting from the first principles of surgical pathology reporting for lesions of the head and neck, the essential elements must capture diagnostic classification grounded in the World Health Organization (WHO) framework, features that influence local aggressiveness and risk of recurrence, and findings that can guide therapy. In head and neck pathology, core report elements are those that either anchor the diagnosis, stratify biological behavior, or carry therapeutic implications; these include classification and subtype, pattern-specific risk modifiers, route-of-spread indicators, completeness of excision, and clinically actionable biomarkers determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or molecular testing.

Ameloblastomas are not graded (low/high), TNM staging is not the primary framework, and *HER2* is not a relevant biomarker. The statement that margins are \"optional\" is dangerously false.\n\n*   **Option C:** This option is incorrect as it confuses ameloblastoma with odontoma, a hamartoma with completely different biological behavior and reporting standards. The elements listed, such as denticle count and *ETV6*–*NTRK3* fusion, are irrelevant to ameloblastoma.\n\n*   **Option D:** This option contains multiple factual errors. The microscopic patterns (follicular/plexiform) are less important than the WHO subtype. Ki-67 and *p53* are not primary prognosticators in routine practice. The claims that perineural invasion does not occur in benign tumors and that targeted therapy is not used for them are both false and outdated.\n\n*   **Option E:** This option describes an incomplete and outdated report. Omitting the WHO subtype is a major flaw. A vague statement about margins is insufficient. Dismissing molecular testing ignores its established role in guiding therapy for advanced ameloblastoma.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A is the only choice that accurately reflects the current, evidence-based standards for a comprehensive synoptic pathology report for ameloblastoma, incorporating all the essential elements for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic decision-making.
