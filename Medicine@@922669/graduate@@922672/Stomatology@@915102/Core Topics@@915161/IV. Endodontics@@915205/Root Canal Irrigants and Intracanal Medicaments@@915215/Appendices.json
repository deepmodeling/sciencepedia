It is free of subjective claims or bias.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary task is to calculate the mass of available chlorine delivered. The problem requires a derivation from foundational definitions.\n\nLet $m$ be the mass of the available chlorine, $C$ be its concentration, and $V$ be the volume of the solution.\nThe concentration is given as $C = 5\\%\\,w/v$. According to the provided definition (i), a concentration of $X\\%\\,w/v$ signifies $X$ grams of solute per $100\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of solution. Therefore, a $5\\%\\,w/v$ concentration corresponds to:\n$$\nC = \\frac{5\\,\\mathrm{g}}{100\\,\\mathrm{mL}}\n$$\nThe volume of the solution delivered is given as:\n$$\nV = 5\\,\\mathrm{mL}\n$$\nThe relationship between mass, concentration, and volume is provided as definition (ii):\n$$\nm = C \\times V\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $C$ and $V$ into this equation:\n$$\nm = \\left(\\frac{5\\,\\mathrm{g}}{100\\,\\mathrm{mL}}\\right) \\times 5\\,\\mathrm{mL}\n$$\nThe units of milliliters ($\\mathrm{mL}$) cancel out, yielding the mass in grams ($\\mathrm{g}$):\n$$\nm = \\frac{5 \\times 5}{100}\\,\\mathrm{g} = \\frac{25}{100}\\,\\mathrm{g} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{g}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be in milligrams ($\\mathrm{mg}$). The conversion factor between grams and milligrams is $1\\,\\mathrm{g} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n$$\nm = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{g} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{1\\,\\mathrm{g}} = 250\\,\\mathrm{mg}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the answer must be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $250$. To express this value with three significant figures unambiguously, it is best written in scientific notation.\n$$\nm = 2.50 \\times 10^2\\,\\mathrm{mg}\n$$\n\n### Qualitative Interpretation\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret the magnitude of this calculated mass, $250\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, in the context of the principles of chlorine demand within a root canal.\n\nThe mass of $250\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ of available chlorine is delivered in a small volume of $5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$. A root canal system has a very small internal volume, typically in the range of microliters to tens of microliters. The irrigation procedure involves delivering the solution, allowing it to act, and then aspirating it, often in a continuous or intermittent flushing motion.\n\nThe problem states that the chlorine demand—the consumption of hypochlorite through redox reactions with organic matter—is limited not by the total amount of available reagent but by other factors: local diffusion, reaction kinetics, and the quantity of accessible organic load.\n\nThe calculated quantity of $250\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ of available chlorine represents a vast chemical reservoir relative to the minute amount of organic substrate (necrotic pulp tissue, microbial biofilms, collagen in dentin) that is immediately accessible on the root canal walls at any given moment. This means that the concentration of the active irrigant remains high and nearly constant in the bulk solution within the canal during the procedure. The depletion of the irrigant occurs only locally at the solution-tissue interface.\n\nThis large excess of the oxidizing agent is clinically crucial. It ensures that the chemical potential driving the dissolution of organic tissue and the killing of microbes remains maximal. The high concentration gradient facilitates the diffusion of the active species (hypochlorous acid, $\\mathrm{HOCl}$, and hypochlorite ion, $\\mathrm{OCl}^−$) into poorly accessible areas like lateral canals, isthmuses, and dentinal tubules.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of $250\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ of available chlorine is not significant because it is expected to be fully consumed. Rather, its significance lies in the fact that it is a substantial surplus. This surplus guarantees that the efficacy of the irrigation is limited by the physical challenges of delivering the irrigant to all internal surfaces of the complex root canal anatomy, rather than by a premature exhaustion of the chemical's potency. The clinical strategy is thus one of overwhelming the system with a high concentration of the reagent to overcome physical and kinetic barriers to its action.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.50 \\times 10^{2}}$$", "id": "4768019"}, {"introduction": "Endodontic therapy often involves the sequential use of different irrigants to achieve multiple goals, such as disinfection and smear layer removal. This practice addresses the critical clinical issue of chemical incompatibility, specifically between sodium hypochlorite ($\\text{NaOCl}$) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). By modeling the redox reaction between these two agents, you will move beyond simply memorizing protocols and gain a fundamental chemical understanding of why their simultaneous use is contraindicated, quantifying the immediate and significant loss of disinfecting capacity [@problem_id:4768000].", "problem": "An endodontist inadvertently combines equal volumes of Sodium Hypochlorite ($\\text{NaOCl}$) and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solutions during root canal irrigation. Free Available Chlorine (FAC) is defined as the oxidant capacity attributable to species with chlorine in the $+1$ oxidation state (primarily hypochlorous acid, $\\text{HOCl}$, and hypochlorite, $\\text{OCl}^-$) and is conventionally quantified by its ability to oxidize iodide to iodine in iodometric titration.

Express the final result as a pure decimal with no unit, and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent.\n\nThe solution is approached in two parts: a qualitative mechanistic explanation followed by a quantitative calculation.\n\n**Part 1: Mechanistic Explanation**\n\nThe reduction in Free Available Chlorine (FAC) upon mixing Sodium Hypochlorite ($\\mathrm{NaOCl}$) and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solutions is due to a rapid redox reaction between the two primary solutes.\n\n1.  **Reactants and their Chemical Roles**:\n    *   **Sodium Hypochlorite ($\\mathrm{NaOCl}$)**: This salt dissociates in water to form sodium ions ($\\mathrm{Na^+}$) and hypochlorite ions ($\\mathrm{OCl^-}$). Hypochlorite exists in equilibrium with hypochlorous acid ($\\mathrm{HOCl}$), with the speciation depending on the pH. The chlorine atom in both $\\mathrm{OCl^-}$ and $\\mathrm{HOCl}$ is in the $+1$ oxidation state. These species are strong oxidizing agents, and their collective oxidizing capacity is defined as the Free Available Chlorine (FAC).\n    *   **Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)**: In endodontics, EDTA is primarily used as a chelating agent. Its chemical structure contains four carboxylate groups that can form stable complexes with metal ions, particularly the calcium ions ($\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$) in the dentinal smear layer. This process of complexation is key to its clinical function. However, the EDTA molecule, specifically the disodium salt form ($\\mathrm{Na_2EDTA}$), also contains two tertiary amine nitrogen atoms within its ethylenediamine backbone. These nitrogen atoms possess lone pairs of electrons, rendering them nucleophilic and susceptible to oxidation, thereby allowing EDTA to act as a reducing agent.\n\n2.  **The Redox Reaction**:\n    When the $\\mathrm{NaOCl}$ and EDTA solutions are mixed, the hypochlorite ion ($\\mathrm{OCl^-}$), being a strong oxidant, reacts with the tertiary amine sites of the EDTA molecule, which act as a reductant. The problem specifies the reaction stoichiometry as the oxidation of each tertiary amine to an amine $N$-oxide:\n    $$ \\mathrm{R_3N + OCl^- \\rightarrow R_3N\\to O + Cl^-} $$\n    In this reaction, the chlorine atom in hypochlorite ($\\mathrm{Cl^{+1}}$) is reduced to a chloride ion ($\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}$), where its oxidation state is $-1$. This represents a gain of two electrons. Concurrently, the tertiary amine nitrogen atom ($\\mathrm{R_3N}$) is oxidized to form the N-oxide. This consumption of the $\\mathrm{OCl^-}$ species, which is the source of FAC, directly and immediately leads to a quantitative drop in the measured FAC.\n\n3.  **Invoking Redox and Complexation**:\n    *   **Redox**: The core of the incompatibility is a redox reaction. The oxidant ($\\mathrm{OCl^-}$) and reductant (tertiary amines of EDTA) are consumed, leading to a loss of their respective chemical properties. The loss of FAC is a direct consequence of the consumption of the oxidizing agent.\n    *   **Complexation**: While EDTA's primary intended function is complexation, this property is distinct from the redox reaction it undergoes with $\\mathrm{NaOCl}$. The rapid loss of FAC is not due to chelation but due to the chemical structure of EDTA fortuitously containing reducing sites. Thus, the two clinically important properties of the individual solutions (the oxidizing power of $\\mathrm{NaOCl}$ and the chelating power of EDTA) are compromised upon mixing due to this destructive redox incompatibility.\n\n**Part 2: Quantitative Calculation**\n\nThe fraction of FAC lost is calculated based on the stoichiometry of the reaction and the initial concentrations of the reactants in the mixture.\n\n1.  **Initial Molar Concentrations**:\n    First, we calculate the molar concentrations of the stock solutions.\n    *   The concentration of the $\\mathrm{NaOCl}$ solution is $5.25\\,\\%$ $\\mathrm{w/v}$, which is $5.25\\,\\mathrm{g}$ per $100\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, or $52.5\\,\\mathrm{g\\,L^{-1}}$. With a molar mass $M_{\\mathrm{NaOCl}}=74.44\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$, the initial molarity is:\n        $$ C_{\\mathrm{NaOCl, init}} = \\frac{52.5\\,\\mathrm{g\\,L^{-1}}}{74.44\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}} $$\n    *   The concentration of the disodium EDTA dihydrate solution is $17\\,\\%$ $\\mathrm{w/v}$, which is $17\\,\\mathrm{g}$ per $100\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, or $170\\,\\mathrm{g\\,L^{-1}}$. With a molar mass $M_{\\mathrm{Na_2EDTA\\cdot 2H_2O}}=372.24\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}}$, the initial molarity is:\n        $$ C_{\\mathrm{EDTA, init}} = \\frac{170\\,\\mathrm{g\\,L^{-1}}}{372.24\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}} $$\n\n2.  **Concentrations in the Mixture**:\n    When equal volumes of the two solutions are mixed, the total volume doubles, and the concentration of each solute is halved.\n    *   Initial concentration of FAC in the mixture is equal to the concentration of $\\mathrm{NaOCl}$:\n        $$ [\\mathrm{FAC}]_0 = C_{\\mathrm{NaOCl, mix}} = \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\mathrm{NaOCl, init}} = \\frac{52.5}{2 \\times 74.44}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}} \\approx 0.35263\\,\\mathrm{M} $$\n    *   Initial concentration of EDTA in the mixture:\n        $$ [\\mathrm{EDTA}]_0 = C_{\\mathrm{EDTA, mix}} = \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\mathrm{EDTA, init}} = \\frac{170}{2 \\times 372.24}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}} \\approx 0.22835\\,\\mathrm{M} $$\n\n3.  **Stoichiometry and Limiting Reactant**:\n    According to the problem, each EDTA molecule contains two tertiary amine nitrogens, and each nitrogen reacts with one hypochlorite ion. Therefore, $1$ mole of EDTA reacts with $2$ moles of $\\mathrm{OCl^-}$ (FAC).\n    $$ \\mathrm{EDTA} + 2\\,\\mathrm{OCl^-} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{EDTA(N\\to O)_2} + 2\\,\\mathrm{Cl^-} $$\n    To determine the limiting reactant, we compare the initial concentration of FAC, $[\\mathrm{FAC}]_0$, with the amount of FAC required to completely react with the available EDTA. The required FAC concentration is $2 \\times [\\mathrm{EDTA}]_0$.\n    *   FAC available: $[\\mathrm{FAC}]_0 \\approx 0.35263\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n    *   FAC required to consume all EDTA: $2 \\times [\\mathrm{EDTA}]_0 \\approx 2 \\times 0.22835\\,\\mathrm{M} \\approx 0.45670\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n\n    Since $[\\mathrm{FAC}]_0 < 2 \\times [\\mathrm{EDTA}]_0$ ($0.35263\\,\\mathrm{M} < 0.45670\\,\\mathrm{M}$), the FAC ($\\mathrm{NaOCl}$) is the limiting reactant. EDTA is in excess.\n\n4.  **Fraction of FAC Lost**:\n    Because FAC is the limiting reactant, the instantaneous reaction will proceed until all the FAC is consumed.\n    The amount of FAC lost is equal to the initial amount of FAC in the mixture.\n    $$ [\\mathrm{FAC}]_{\\text{lost}} = [\\mathrm{FAC}]_0 $$\n    The fraction of FAC lost, $f$, is the ratio of the amount lost to the initial amount:\n    $$ f = \\frac{[\\mathrm{FAC}]_{\\text{lost}}}{[\\mathrm{FAC}]_0} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{FAC}]_0}{[\\mathrm{FAC}]_0} = 1 $$\n    The calculation shows that, under the given model and concentrations, all of the Free Available Chlorine is consumed instantaneously.\n\n    Expressed symbolically, the fraction lost is $f = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{2 \\times [\\mathrm{EDTA}]_0}{[\\mathrm{FAC}]_0}\\right)$.\n    The ratio is:\n    $$ \\frac{2 \\times [\\mathrm{EDTA}]_0}{[\\mathrm{FAC}]_0} = \\frac{2 \\times \\frac{170}{2 \\times 372.24}}{\\frac{52.5}{2 \\times 74.44}} = \\frac{170 \\times 2 \\times 74.44}{52.5 \\times 2 \\times 372.24} = \\frac{170 \\times 74.44}{52.5 \\times 372.24} \\approx \\frac{12654.8}{19542.6} \\approx 1.295 $$\n    Since this ratio is greater than $1$, the fraction lost is $f = \\min(1, 1.295) = 1$.\n\n    The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n## SOLUTION\n\nThe problem describes a fluidic circuit with two parallel branches originating from a common node at the needle tip, where the pressure is $p_{n}$. The total inflow $Q_{\\mathrm{in}}$ splits into a proximal outflow $Q_{\\mathrm{up}}$ and an apical outflow $Q_{\\mathrm{apex}}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the analytical expression for the apical pressure, $p_{\\mathrm{apex}}$. The pressure drop from the node at $x=d$ to the periapical tissue at pressure $p_{t}$ occurs across the series resistances $R_{\\mathrm{down}}$ and $R_{f}$. The apical flow is therefore $Q_{\\mathrm{apex}} = (p_{n} - p_{t}) / (R_{\\mathrm{down}} + R_{f})$. The pressure inside the canal at the apex ($x=0$), $p_{\\mathrm{apex}}$, is the pressure at the junction between the $R_{\\mathrm{down}}$ and $R_{f}$ resistances. Thus, the pressure drop across the foramen resistance $R_f$ is $p_{\\mathrm{apex}} - p_t$. This gives the relation:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{apex}} - p_t = Q_{\\mathrm{apex}} R_{f} \\implies p_{\\mathrm{apex}} = p_t + Q_{\\mathrm{apex}} R_{f}$$\nTo express $p_{\\mathrm{apex}}$ in terms of $Q_{\\mathrm{in}}$, we must first find $Q_{\\mathrm{apex}}$ as a function of $Q_{\\mathrm{in}}$. We have a system of three linear equations:\n1.  Mass conservation: $Q_{\\mathrm{in}} = Q_{\\mathrm{up}} + Q_{\\mathrm{apex}}$\n2.  Proximal flow: $Q_{\\mathrm{up}} = \\frac{p_{n} - p_{\\mathrm{mouth}}}{R_{\\mathrm{up}}}$\n3.  Apical flow: $Q_{\\mathrm{apex}} = \\frac{p_{n} - p_{t}}{R_{\\mathrm{down}} + R_{f}}$\n\nFrom (2) and (3), we express $p_{n}$ in two ways: $p_{n} = Q_{\\mathrm{up}} R_{\\mathrm{up}} + p_{\\mathrm{mouth}}$ and $p_{n} = Q_{\\mathrm{apex}}(R_{\\mathrm{down}} + R_{f}) + p_{t}$. Setting them equal:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{up}} R_{\\mathrm{up}} + p_{\\mathrm{mouth}} = Q_{\\mathrm{apex}}(R_{\\mathrm{down}} + R_{f}) + p_{t}$$\nSubstitute $Q_{\\mathrm{up}} = Q_{\\mathrm{in}} - Q_{\\mathrm{apex}}$ from (1) and set $p_{\\mathrm{mouth}}=0$:\n$$(Q_{\\mathrm{in}} - Q_{\\mathrm{apex}}) R_{\\mathrm{up}} = Q_{\\mathrm{apex}}(R_{\\mathrm{down}} + R_{f}) + p_{t}$$\nNow, we solve for $Q_{\\mathrm{apex}}$:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{in}} R_{\\mathrm{up}} - Q_{\\mathrm{apex}} R_{\\mathrm{up}} = Q_{\\mathrm{apex}} R_{\\mathrm{down}} + Q_{\\mathrm{apex}} R_{f} + p_{t}$$\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{in}} R_{\\mathrm{up}} - p_t = Q_{\\mathrm{apex}} (R_{\\mathrm{up}} + R_{\\mathrm{down}} + R_{f})$$\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{apex}} = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{in}} R_{\\mathrm{up}} - p_t}{R_{\\mathrm{up}} + R_{\\mathrm{down}} + R_{f}}$$\nFinally, substituting this expression for $Q_{\\mathrm{apex}}$ into the equation for $p_{\\mathrm{apex}}$:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{apex}} = p_t + R_{f} \\left( \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{in}} R_{\\mathrm{up}} - p_t}{R_{\\mathrm{up}} + R_{\\mathrm{down}} + R_{f}} \\right)$$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{apex}} = \\frac{p_t(R_{\\mathrm{up}} + R_{\\mathrm{down}} + R_f) + R_f(Q_{\\mathrm{in}} R_{\\mathrm{up}} - p_t)}{R_{\\mathrm{up}} + R_{\\mathrm{down}} + R_{f}} = \\frac{p_t(R_{\\mathrm{up}} + R_{\\mathrm{down}}) + Q_{\\mathrm{in}} R_{f} R_{\\mathrm{up}}}{R_{\\mathrm{up}} + R_{\\mathrm{down}} + R_{f}}$$\nThis is the desired analytical expression for $p_{\\mathrm{apex}}$. The resistances are functions of the geometric and fluid parameters. The integrals for $R_{\\mathrm{up}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{down}}$ are evaluated as follows:\n$\\int \\frac{dx}{(r_a + \\alpha x)^4} = -\\frac{1}{3\\alpha(r_a + \\alpha x)^3} + C$.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{down}} = \\frac{8\\mu}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{d} \\frac{dx}{[r(x)]^{4}} = \\frac{8\\mu}{3\\pi\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{1}{r_a^3} - \\frac{1}{(r_a + \\alpha d)^3} \\right)$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{up}} = \\frac{8\\mu}{\\pi} \\int_{d}^{L} \\frac{dx}{[r(x)]^{4}} = \\frac{8\\mu}{3\\pi\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{1}{(r_a + \\alpha d)^3} - \\frac{1}{(r_a + \\alpha L)^3} \\right)$$\n$R_f$ is given by $R_f = \\frac{8 \\mu l_{f}}{\\pi r_{f}^{4}}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the maximum inflow $Q_{\\mathrm{in,max}}$ that ensures $p_{\\mathrm{apex}}  p_{\\mathrm{apex,max}} = 1.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$. We set $p_{\\mathrm{apex}} = p_{\\mathrm{apex,max}}$ and solve our derived expression for $Q_{\\mathrm{in}}$, which will be $Q_{\\mathrm{in,max}}$.\n$$p_{\\mathrm{apex,max}} (R_{\\mathrm{up}} + R_{\\mathrm{down}} + R_{f}) = p_t(R_{\\mathrm{up}} + R_{\\mathrm{down}}) + Q_{\\mathrm{in,max}} R_{f} R_{\\mathrm{up}}$$\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{in,max}} R_{f} R_{\\mathrm{up}} = p_{\\mathrm{apex,max}}(R_{\\mathrm{up}} + R_{\\mathrm{down}} + R_{f}) - p_t(R_{\\mathrm{up}} + R_{\\mathrm{down}})$$\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{in,max}} = \\frac{(p_{\\mathrm{apex,max}} - p_{t})(R_{\\mathrm{up}} + R_{\\mathrm{down}}) + p_{\\mathrm{apex,max}}R_{f}}{R_{f} R_{\\mathrm{up}}}$$\nNow we compute the numerical values.\nThe taper is $\\alpha = \\frac{r(L)-r_{a}}{L} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m} - 1.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{0.018\\,\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{-4}}{1.8 \\times 10^{-2}} = 0.01$.\nThe radius at the needle tip is $r(d) = r_a + \\alpha d = 1.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m} + (0.01)(1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 1.3 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nWe calculate the resistances:\n$R_{\\mathrm{down}} = \\frac{8(1.2 \\times 10^{-3})}{3\\pi(0.01)} \\left( \\frac{1}{(1.2 \\times 10^{-4})^3} - \\frac{1}{(1.3 \\times 10^{-4})^3} \\right) \\approx 1.2585 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s / m^3}$.\n$R_{\\mathrm{up}} = \\frac{8(1.2 \\times 10^{-3})}{3\\pi(0.01)} \\left( \\frac{1}{(1.3 \\times 10^{-4})^3} - \\frac{1}{(3.0 \\times 10^{-4})^3} \\right) \\approx 4.2585 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s / m^3}$.\n$R_{f} = \\frac{8(1.2 \\times 10^{-3})(5.0 \\times 10^{-4})}{\\pi(8.0 \\times 10^{-5})^4} \\approx 3.7299 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s / m^3}$.\n\nUsing these values, with $p_{\\mathrm{apex,max}} = 1.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ and $p_{t} = 2.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{up}} + R_{\\mathrm{down}} \\approx (4.2585 + 1.2585) \\times 10^{10} = 5.517 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s / m^3}$$\n$$R_{f} R_{\\mathrm{up}} \\approx (3.7299 \\times 10^{10})(4.2585 \\times 10^{10}) \\approx 1.5885 \\times 10^{21}\\,(\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s / m^3})^2$$\nThe numerator of the expression for $Q_{\\mathrm{in,max}}$ becomes:\n$$(1.0 \\times 10^4 - 2.0 \\times 10^3)(5.517 \\times 10^{10}) + (1.0 \\times 10^4)(3.7299 \\times 10^{10})$$\n$$= (8.0 \\times 10^3)(5.517 \\times 10^{10}) + 3.7299 \\times 10^{14} = 4.4136 \\times 10^{14} + 3.7299 \\times 10^{14} = 8.1435 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{Pa^2 \\cdot s / m^3}$$\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{in,max}} = \\frac{8.1435 \\times 10^{14}}{1.5885 \\times 10^{21}} \\approx 5.1266 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m^3/s}$$\nTo convert to $\\mathrm{mL/min}$:\n$Q_{\\mathrm{in,max}} = (5.1266 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m^3/s}) \\times (10^6\\,\\mathrm{mL/m^3}) \\times (60\\,\\mathrm{s/min}) = 30.7596\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\nRounding to three significant figures, $Q_{\\mathrm{in,max}} = 30.8\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the extrusion fraction $f = Q_{\\mathrm{apex}}/Q_{\\mathrm{in}}$ at $Q_{\\mathrm{in}} = Q_{\\mathrm{in,max}}$. At this threshold, $p_{\\mathrm{apex}} = p_{\\mathrm{apex,max}}$. We can find $Q_{\\mathrm{apex}}$ from the simpler relation $p_{\\mathrm{apex}} = p_t + Q_{\\mathrm{apex}} R_{f}$:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{apex}} = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{apex,max}} - p_{t}}{R_{f}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{Pa} - 2.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Pa}}{3.7299 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s / m^3}} = \\frac{8000}{3.7299 \\times 10^{10}} \\approx 2.1448 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m^3/s}$$\nThe fraction $f$ is then:\n$$f = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{apex}}}{Q_{\\mathrm{in,max}}} = \\frac{2.1448 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m^3/s}}{5.1266 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m^3/s}} \\approx 0.41836$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $f = 0.418$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 30.8  0.418 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4768016"}]}
