Select an ISO $30$ cone with $0.04$ taper; seat to $20.5\\,\\text{mm}$ to reach the apical foramen for maximum sealing; rely on sealer to fill any remaining space at the constriction.**\n\nThis option is flawed on multiple grounds.\n-   **Cone Selection:** The cone ($D_0=0.30\\,\\text{mm}$, $k=0.04$) is too small and has a mismatched taper for the canal ($D_{apical}=0.35\\,\\text{mm}$, $k=0.05$). This results in a loose fit.\n-   **Seating Depth:** Targeting the apical foramen at $20.5\\,\\text{mm}$ violates the principle of stopping at the constriction ($20.0\\,\\text{mm}$) and constitutes extrusion.\n-   **Sealing:** Relying on a large volume of sealer to fill a significant gap is poor practice and violates the minimal sealer film principle.

This taper mismatch means the cone will only bind at the very tip, leading to a poor fit and absent tug-back, requiring excessive sealer.\n-   **Cutting the Tip:** This instruction is nonsensical. The goal is to fit a $0.35\\,\\text{mm}$ constriction.

Since the setup is at atmospheric pressure and the apical foramen is pressure-free, the primary driving force for flow into a microporous network is capillarity. The capillary pressure is given by the Young-Laplace equation, $\\Delta P = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r}$, where $r$ is the effective radius of the pore.\nThe resulting flow can be modeled using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for a single cylindrical pore: $Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{8 \\eta L} \\Delta P$.\nSubstituting the expression for capillary pressure, we get:\n$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{8 \\eta L} \\left( \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi r^3 \\gamma \\cos\\theta}{4 \\eta L}$.\nWe can use this equation to solve for the effective radius $r$ of a single pore (or an equivalent network) that would produce the observed flow rate $Q \\approx 1.74 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{m^3/s}$.\n$r^3 = \\frac{4 \\eta L Q}{\\pi \\gamma \\cos\\theta}$\nUsing the provided values: $\\eta \\approx 1.0\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$, $L = 8.0\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\gamma \\approx 0.072\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$, and $\\theta \\approx 25^\\circ$ ($\\cos\\theta \\approx 0.906$):\n$r^3 = \\frac{4 (1.0\\times 10^{-3}) (8.0 \\times 10^{-3}) (1.74 \\times 10^{-14})}{\\pi (0.072) (0.906)} \\approx \\frac{5.568 \\times 10^{-19}}{0.205} \\approx 2.71 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m^3}$.\n$r = (2.71 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m^3})^{1/3} \\approx 1.39 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 1.39\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThis calculation demonstrates that a continuous pathway with an effective radius of only $r \\approx 1.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is sufficient to explain the observed leakage.

Such \"sub-voxel\" features, like thin interfacial gaps or a network of micro-cracks, would not be resolved as a continuous path by the micro-CT analysis, which operates on a voxel-by-voxel basis.

The observed $V_{\\mathrm{leak}}$ is attributable to purely Fickian diffusion through the solid epoxy sealer matrix without any fluid-filled void connectivity; the required effective diffusion coefficient in the solid is consistent with $D_{e}$.**\nOur analysis showed that transport via diffusion through the solid epoxy matrix would result in a leakage volume approximately $10^5$ times smaller than what was measured. The mechanism is quantitatively insufficient.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The leakage most likely traversed the coronal restoration rather than the obturation, because a low $f_{\\mathrm{PFV}}$ on micro-CT implies an impermeable three-dimensional obturation.**\nThis interpretation is directly contradicted by the negative control experiment. The negative controls, which had identical coronal and external sealing, showed negligible leakage ($V_{\\mathrm{leak,neg}} < 0.01\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$). This isolates the leakage pathway to the root canal filling itself.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The discrepancy lies within ordinary experimental variability; no inference about micro-void connectivity can be made from these measurements.**\nThe measured leakage in the test group ($1.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$) is over $150$ times greater than the upper bound of the negative control ($< 0.01\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$) and significantly different from the positive control. This is a scientifically significant difference, not random noise.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4773237"}]}
