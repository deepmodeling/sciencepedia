I will first validate the problem statement according to the specified criteria.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Radiographic root length, $L_{\\text{root}} = 21\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Post length guideline (the “two-thirds rule”): $L_{\\text{post}} \\approx \\frac{2}{3} L_{\\text{root}}$.\n- Apical sealing segment of gutta-percha to be preserved, $L_{\\text{GP}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Safety margin beyond the apical seal, $L_{\\text{safety}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- The objective is to determine the minimal post length inside the root, $L_{\\text{post}}$, that satisfies the two-thirds rule while respecting the apical seal and safety margin constraints.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is set within the context of dental science (endodontics). The \"two-thirds rule\" for post length and the preservation of a $4\\text{–}5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ apical gutta-percha seal are well-established, evidence-based clinical guidelines for post-and-core restorations. The parameters and values given ($L_{\\text{root}} = 21\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ for a maxillary premolar, $L_{\\text{GP}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) are clinically realistic. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides sufficient data to determine a solution. The phrase \"approximately two-thirds\" is a clinical guideline, but the problem's request to find the length that \"satisfies the two-thirds rule\" formalizes this into a specific calculation for the purpose of the problem. We must calculate the value from this rule and then check its validity against the other constraints. This structure leads to a unique and stable solution.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem statement is objective and quantitative, free from subjective or opinion-based claims.\n4.  **Consistency:** The constraints must be checked for mutual consistency.\n    - The length dictated by the two-thirds rule must be calculated.\n    - The maximum permissible post length, limited by the apical seal and safety margin, must also be calculated.\n    - If the length from the two-thirds rule is less than or equal to the maximum permissible length, the constraints are consistent and a solution exists.\n    - Let's perform a preliminary check: The length from the two-thirds rule is $\\frac{2}{3} \\times 21\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 14\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The maximum allowed length is $21\\,\\mathrm{mm} - 5\\,\\mathrm{mm} - 1\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Since $14\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\le 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, the constraints are consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. I will proceed with a formal solution.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the determination of a post length, $L_{\\text{post}}$, that adheres to multiple clinical constraints simultaneously. Let us define the given parameters symbolically:\n- Total radiographic root length: $L_{\\text{root}} = 21\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Required length of apical gutta-percha seal: $L_{\\text{GP}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Required safety margin: $L_{\\text{safety}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n\nThe problem poses two primary conditions that $L_{\\text{post}}$ must meet.\n\n**Condition 1: The \"Two-Thirds Rule\" for Post Retention.**\nThis rule is a guideline for ensuring adequate post retention. The problem asks for the length that \"satisfies\" this rule, which we interpret as calculating the post length directly from this principle. Let this target length be $L_{\\text{rule}}$.\n$$L_{\\text{rule}} = \\frac{2}{3} L_{\\text{root}}$$\nSubstituting the given value for $L_{\\text{root}}$:\n$$L_{\\text{rule}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 21\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 14\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThus, the length that satisfies the two-thirds rule is $14\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n**Condition 2: Preservation of Apical Integrity.**\nTo maintain the integrity of the apical seal and avoid procedural errors like root perforation, a certain portion of the apical root structure must remain free of the post. This preserved length, $L_{\\text{apical}}$, is the sum of the gutta-percha seal and the safety margin.\n$$L_{\\text{apical}} = L_{\\text{GP}} + L_{\\text{safety}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$L_{\\text{apical}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm} + 1\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThis condition imposes an upper limit on the post length. The post cannot extend into this $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ apical zone. Therefore, the maximum allowable post length, $L_{\\text{max}}$, is the total root length minus this preserved apical length.\n$$L_{\\text{max}} = L_{\\text{root}} - L_{\\text{apical}}$$\n$$L_{\\text{max}} = 21\\,\\mathrm{mm} - 6\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nSo, any post placed in this root must satisfy the inequality $L_{\\text{post}} \\le 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n**Synthesizing the Conditions.**\nThe problem asks for the minimal post length that satisfies the two-thirds rule without violating the other requirements.\n- The length that satisfies the two-thirds rule is $L_{\\text{rule}} = 14\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- We must verify if this length violates the apical integrity constraint, which stipulates that $L_{\\text{post}} \\le 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nComparing the two values, we find that $14\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\le 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This indicates that a post of length $14\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is manufacturable and will not compromise the required $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ of apical structures.\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimal post length ... that satisfies the two-thirds rule\". The length that precisely satisfies this rule is $14\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Since this length is a valid one (it does not violate other constraints), it is the correct answer. The use of \"minimal\" in this context refers to the value specified by the rule itself, as opposed to a longer post which might also be biomechanically acceptable but would exceed the specific guideline.\n\nTherefore, the required post length is $14\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{14}$$", "id": "4755389"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the post itself, the long-term success of a restoration depends critically on the strength of the remaining coronal tooth structure.

It provides a self-contained set of assumptions and data required for a formal solution.\n\nThe probability of catastrophic fracture, $P_f$, is modeled using the two-parameter Weibull cumulative distribution function (CDF).

The relationship between ferrule height and fracture resistance is known to be non-linear. The benefit of increasing ferrule height typically shows diminishing returns, eventually plateauing. The model also inaccurately implies zero resistance ($\\lambda=0$) for a zero-height ferrule ($h=0$), whereas the post-and-core system itself provides some baseline resistance. A more realistic model might take the form $\\lambda(h) = \\lambda_0 + f(h)$, where $\\lambda_0$ is the baseline resistance and $f(h)$ is a non-linear, saturating function.\n\n2.  **Statistical Model and Load Conditions:** The Weibull model for static failure has several limitations in this context.\n    - **Static vs. Dynamic Loading:** The model considers a single, static overload. In a clinical setting, teeth fail more commonly due to fatigue from millions of cycles of lower magnitude chewing forces. A fatigue analysis would provide a more realistic prediction of long-term restoration survival.\n    - **Axial Loading:** The problem specifies an axial compressive load. This is a very favorable loading condition. Clinical forces are typically non-axial (eccentric), creating bending moments that generate much higher tensile stresses at the tooth's cervical region. The fracture-protective effect of a ferrule is most critical under these bending loads, a crucial aspect not captured by this simplified model.\n    - **Monolithic Material Assumption:** The two-parameter Weibull model is best suited for monolithic brittle materials. The restored tooth is a complex assembly of different materials (dentin, luting cement, post, crown) with distinct properties and interfaces. Failure can initiate in different components or at their interfaces, representing competing failure modes that are not adequately described by a single Weibull distribution.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6319}\n$$", "id": "4755443"}]}
