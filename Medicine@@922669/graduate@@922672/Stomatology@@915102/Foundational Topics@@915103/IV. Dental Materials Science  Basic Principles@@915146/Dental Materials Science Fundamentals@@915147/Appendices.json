This practice moves from quantifying shrinkage to modeling the resulting stress, a primary cause of bond failure and microleakage. You will use a simplified linear elastic model, $\\sigma = E \\epsilon$, to estimate the polymerization stress in a high C-factor restoration [@problem_id:4709528], providing a first-order approximation of this critical phenomenon and a basis for understanding the importance of stress-reducing clinical techniques.", "problem": "A resin-based composite is placed in a Class I cavity with a configuration factor (C-factor) of $C=5$. At the gel point, the material exhibits an instantaneous elastic modulus of $E=3\\,\\text{GPa}$. The polymerization induces a free (eigen) shrinkage strain of $\\epsilon_{s}=2.5\\%$ that, in the directions normal to the bonded walls, would occur in the absence of any constraint. Treat the composite, at this stage, as an isotropic, linear elastic solid and assume that the bonded cavity walls enforce zero total strain in the restrained directions due to the high $C$-factor.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of strain and the linear elastic constitutive law, derive a physically justified expression for the interfacial normal shrinkage stress generated by the restrained eigenstrain and compute its numerical value.

The total strain, $\\epsilon_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the elastic strain, $\\epsilon_{\\text{elastic}}$, and the polymerization shrinkage eigenstrain, $\\epsilon_{s}$. For a contraction, we can write $\\epsilon_{\\text{total}} = \\epsilon_{\\text{elastic}} - \\epsilon_{s}$.\nThe problem states that the rigid cavity walls enforce zero total strain, so $\\epsilon_{\\text{total}} = 0$. This implies that a tensile elastic strain must develop to counteract the shrinkage: $\\epsilon_{\\text{elastic}} = \\epsilon_{s}$.\nAccording to the one-dimensional linear elastic constitutive law (Hooke's Law), the resulting stress, $\\sigma$, is the product of the elastic modulus, $E$, and this elastic strain:\n$$ \\sigma = E \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\text{elastic}} = E \\cdot \\epsilon_{s} $$\nGiven an elastic modulus $E = 3\\,\\text{GPa} = 3 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{MPa}$ and a free shrinkage strain $\\epsilon_{s} = 2.5\\% = 0.025$, the stress is calculated as:\n$$ \\sigma = (3 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{MPa}) \\times 0.025 = 75\\,\\text{MPa} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the stress is $75.00\\,\\text{MPa}$.\n\nThis calculated value of $75.00\\,\\text{MPa}$ should be interpreted as a theoretical upper bound, not a definitive clinical value, due to several idealizations in the model. First, real composites are viscoelastic, not purely elastic, and exhibit stress relaxation that lowers the peak stress over time. Second, the tooth structure is compliant, not perfectly rigid, which allows for some strain relief. Lastly, the one-dimensional model is a simplification; a high C-factor creates a complex multi-axial stress state.
