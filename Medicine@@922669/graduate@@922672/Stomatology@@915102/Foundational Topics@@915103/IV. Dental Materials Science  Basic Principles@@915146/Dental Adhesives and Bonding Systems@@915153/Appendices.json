The problem has been validated and found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. I will now proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the infiltration depth $x(t)$ of a liquid into a cylindrical pore, followed by a numerical evaluation. The flow is driven by capillary pressure and resisted by viscous drag. The analysis is based on a balance between these two forces, under the assumption of a quasi-steady state where inertial effects are negligible.\n\nFirst, we determine the driving pressure, which is the capillary pressure $\\Delta P_{cap}$ at the advancing meniscus. According to the Young-Laplace equation for a cylindrical capillary of radius $r$, this pressure is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{cap} = \\frac{2\\gamma\\cos\\theta}{r}\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the surface tension of the liquid and $\\theta$ is the static contact angle between the liquid and the pore wall. This pressure is assumed to be constant throughout the infiltration process.\n\nNext, we establish the resistive pressure, which is the viscous pressure drop $\\Delta P_{visc}$ along the wetted length of the pore, $x(t)$. The problem specifies that the flow is laminar and obeys the Hagen–Poiseuille law. The volumetric flow rate $Q$ through a cylindrical pipe of radius $r$ and length $L$ is:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{8\\eta} \\frac{\\Delta P}{L}\n$$\nIn our case, the length of the liquid column is $L = x(t)$, and the pressure drop is $\\Delta P = \\Delta P_{visc}$. The dynamic viscosity of the fluid is $\\eta$. Rearranging for the viscous pressure drop, we have:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{visc} = \\frac{8\\eta x(t) Q}{\\pi r^4}\n$$\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is related to the velocity of the infiltration front, $\\frac{dx}{dt}$. The volume of the infiltrated liquid is $V(t) = \\pi r^2 x(t)$. Therefore, the flow rate is:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{dV}{dt} = \\pi r^2 \\frac{dx}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $Q$ into the equation for $\\Delta P_{visc}$:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{visc} = \\frac{8\\eta x(t)}{\\pi r^4} \\left(\\pi r^2 \\frac{dx}{dt}\\right) = \\frac{8\\eta x(t)}{r^2} \\frac{dx}{dt}\n$$\nUnder the assumption of capillarity-dominated flow with negligible inertia, the driving capillary pressure is balanced by the resisting viscous pressure drop at every instant in time:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{cap} = \\Delta P_{visc}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for both pressures:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\gamma\\cos\\theta}{r} = \\frac{8\\eta x(t)}{r^2} \\frac{dx}{dt}\n$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation for $x(t)$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid mechanics and dental materials science, is well-posed, and provides sufficient, consistent data for a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts: a definition and a calculation.\n\nFirst, we address the definition of microtensile bond strength testing.\nMicrotensile bond strength ($\\mu$TBS) testing is a destructive mechanical test used in stomatology to quantify the adhesive strength at an interface, typically between tooth structure (dentin or enamel) and a dental restorative material.\n-   **What is measured**: The test measures the ultimate tensile stress, which is the maximum tensile force per unit area that the bonded interface can withstand before fracture. This value is reported as the bond strength, usually in units of megapascals ($\\text{MPa}$).\n-   **Specimen configuration**: A bulk specimen, formed by bonding the two materials of interest, is sectioned into multiple small beams or \"sticks\". The bonded interface is oriented perpendicularly to the long axis of each beam. The cross-sectional area at the interface is deliberately kept small, typically around $1~\\text{mm}^{2}$, and is often trimmed to an \"hourglass\" or \"dumbbell\" shape. This configuration promotes a more uniform stress distribution and increases the likelihood that failure initiates at the interface rather than from extrinsic flaws in the bulk material.\n-   **Specimen loading**: Each micro-specimen is secured in a specialized jig attached to a universal testing machine. A uniaxial tensile load is applied at a constant rate of displacement, pulling the specimen apart along its long axis and perpendicular to the bonded interface, until fracture occurs. The maximum load sustained before fracture is recorded.\n\nSecond, we proceed with the calculation of the normal tensile stress at the bonded interface using first principles of mechanics.\nNormal stress, denoted by $\\sigma$, is defined as the force, $F$, acting perpendicular to a surface, divided by the cross-sectional area, $A$, over which the force is distributed. The problem states to assume a uniform stress distribution.
