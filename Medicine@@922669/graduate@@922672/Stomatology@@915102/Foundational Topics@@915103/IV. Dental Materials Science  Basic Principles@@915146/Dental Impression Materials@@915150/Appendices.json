In practice, sodium phosphate is used as a retarder because it preferentially reacts with calcium ions, forming insoluble calcium phosphate and thereby delaying the availability of free calcium ions for alginate crosslinking. Consider a well-mixed system in which calcium sulfate provides calcium ions at an approximately constant zero-order dissolution flux $r$ (in $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) over the relevant time window, and sodium phosphate (treated as a single phosphate species for stoichiometric accounting) is initially present at concentration $R_0$ (in $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$).

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Gelation Time, $T_{\\mathrm{gel}}$\nThe setting process can be divided into two sequential phases based on the problem's kinetic assumptions.\n\n**Phase 1: Retardation Period**\nDuring this initial phase, all calcium ions ($\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$) released from the calcium sulfate source are consumed by the phosphate ions. The problem states that this reaction is effectively instantaneous and that no significant alginate crosslinking occurs until all the phosphate is consumed. Let $T_{\\mathrm{retard}}$ be the duration of this phase.\n\nThe total molar concentration of phosphate to be consumed is $R_0$.\nAccording to the stoichiometry, $m$ moles of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ are required to precipitate one mole of phosphate. Therefore, the total molar concentration of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ needed to consume all the phosphate is $m R_0$.\n\nCalcium ions are supplied at a constant rate $r$. The total concentration of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ supplied over a time interval $T_{\\mathrm{retard}}$ is given by the product $r T_{\\mathrm{retard}}$.\n\nAt the end of the retardation period, the total amount of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ supplied must equal the total amount of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ required to deplete the phosphate.\n$$r T_{\\mathrm{retard}} = m R_0$$\nSolving for the retardation time, $T_{\\mathrm{retard}}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{retard}} = \\frac{m R_0}{r}$$\n\n**Phase 2: Alginate Crosslinking Period**\nThis phase begins at $t = T_{\\mathrm{retard}}$, once all the phosphate has been precipitated. From this point forward, any newly dissolved $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is available to crosslink the alginate carboxylate sites.\n\nThe gel point is reached when a fraction $f_c$ of the total available sites $S$ has been crosslinked. The concentration of sites that must be crosslinked to reach the gel point is $f_c S$.\n\nEach $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ion crosslinks $b$ sites. Therefore, the total concentration of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ required to reach the gel point, denoted as $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{gel}}$, is:\n$$[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{gel}} = \\frac{f_c S}{b}$$\n\nLet $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{gel}}$ be the duration of this second phase, i.e., the time elapsed from the end of the retardation period until the gel point is reached. During this time, $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions continue to be supplied at the constant rate $r$. The total concentration of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ supplied during this phase is $r \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{gel}}$.\n\nThis supplied $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ must equal the amount required to achieve the necessary crosslinking:\n$$r \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{gel}} = [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{gel}} = \\frac{f_c S}{b}$$\nSolving for the duration of the crosslinking phase, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{gel}}$:\n$$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{gel}} = \\frac{f_c S}{b r}$$\n\n**Total Gelation Time, $T_{\\mathrm{gel}}$**\nThe total gelation time, $T_{\\mathrm{gel}}$, is the sum of the durations of the two sequential phases:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{gel}} = T_{\\mathrm{retard}} + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{gel}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived for each phase:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{gel}} = \\frac{m R_0}{r} + \\frac{f_c S}{b r}$$\nThis expression can be factored to give the final analytical form for the gelation time:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{gel}} = \\frac{1}{r} \\left( m R_0 + \\frac{f_c S}{b} \\right)$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nThe problem provides the following numerical values:\n- $R_0 = 8\\,\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} = 8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n- $r = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.6 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $m = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$\n- $S = 50\\,\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} = 50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n- $f_c = 0.25$\n- $b = 2$\n\nSubstitute these values into the derived expression for $T_{\\mathrm{gel}}$.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem describes the squeeze flow of a viscous fluid between two parallel circular disks. We will use a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, z)$, with the origin at the center of the stationary lower plate (the tooth). The lower plate is at $z=0$ and the upper plate is at $z=h(t)$, moving downwards with speed $U = -\\frac{dh}{dt}$. Due to the geometry and motion, the flow is axisymmetric, so all quantities are independent of $\\theta$.\n\nThe flow is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. For a thin film ($h \\ll R$) and low Reynolds number, we can use the lubrication approximation. The continuity equation for an incompressible fluid is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial(r v_r)}{\\partial r} + \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\nThe radial component of the momentum equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} = \\mu \\frac{\\partial^2 v_r}{\\partial z^2} $$\nHere, $p$ is the pressure, $\\mu$ is the viscosity, and $v_r$ is the radial velocity. The pressure is assumed to be a function of $r$ only, $p=p(r)$.\n\nWe apply the no-slip boundary conditions:\n1. At the stationary plate ($z=0$): $v_r(r, 0) = 0$.\n2. At the moving plate ($z=h$): $v_r(r, h) = 0$.\n\nIntegrating the simplified momentum equation twice with respect to $z$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial v_r}{\\partial z} = \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\frac{dp}{dr} z + C_1 $$\n$$ v_r(r, z) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{dp}{dr} z^2 + C_1 z + C_2 $$\nApplying the boundary condition at $z=0$ gives $C_2 = 0$.\nApplying the boundary condition at $z=h$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{dp}{dr} h^2 + C_1 h \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{h}{2\\mu}\\frac{dp}{dr} $$\nSubstituting $C_1$ and $C_2$ back gives the parabolic radial velocity profile:\n$$ v_r(r, z) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{dp}{dr}(z^2 - hz) $$\n\nNext, we use the principle of mass conservation. Integrating the continuity equation across the gap from $z=0$ to $z=h$:\n$$ \\int_0^h \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial(r v_r)}{\\partial r}\\right) dz + \\int_0^h \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} dz = 0 $$\nUsing the Leibniz integral rule for the first term and evaluating the second term:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\int_0^h v_r dz \\right) + v_z(h) - v_z(0) = 0 $$\nThe vertical velocity boundary conditions are $v_z(0) = 0$ (stationary plate) and $v_z(h) = -U$ (moving plate).

This determines the constant $C_4$:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{3\\mu U}{h^3} R^2 + C_4 \\implies C_4 = \\frac{3\\mu U R^2}{h^3} $$\nThe pressure distribution is therefore:\n$$ p(r) = \\frac{3\\mu U R^2}{h^3} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2} \\right) $$\nThe maximum pressure occurs at the center ($r=0$):\n$$ p_{max} = p(0) = \\frac{3\\mu U R^2}{h^3} $$\nThis is the required governing relation connecting the maximum pressure to the system parameters. The critical condition occurs when the gap reaches its minimum value, $h_{\\star}$, at which point the maximum pressure must not exceed the critical pressure, $p_c$.\n$$ p_c = \\frac{3\\mu U R^2}{h_{\\star}^3} $$\nSolving for the smallest uniform spacer thickness, $h_{\\star}$:\n$$ h_{\\star}^3 = \\frac{3\\mu U R^2}{p_c} \\implies h_{\\star} = \\left( \\frac{3\\mu U R^2}{p_c} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $h_{\\star}$ using the provided parameters:\n$\\mu = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$, $U = 0.0020\\,\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $R = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and $p_{c} = 1.20\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n$$ h_{\\star} = \\left( \\frac{3(8.0)(0.0020)(0.020)^2}{1.20 \\times 10^4} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n$$ h_{\\star} = \\left( \\frac{24.0 \\times 2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 4.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{1.20 \\times 10^4} \\right)^{1/3} \\,\\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ h_{\\star} = \\left( \\frac{1.92 \\times 10^{-5}}{1.20 \\times 10^4} \\right)^{1/3} \\,\\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ h_{\\star} = (1.6 \\times 10^{-9})^{1/3} \\,\\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ h_{\\star} = (1.6)^{1/3} \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nCalculating the cube root of $1.6$: $(1.6)^{1/3} \\approx 1.169608$.\n$$ h_{\\star} \\approx 1.169608 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nThe problem asks for the answer in millimeters, which is $1.169608\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Rounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ h_{\\star} \\approx 1.17\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\n\nFinally, we use the governing relation $p_{max} = \\frac{3\\mu U R^2}{h^3}$ to explain the effect of a local negative deviation in spacer thickness. Let the intended thickness be $h_{nominal}$. A local negative deviation by a fractional amount $\\delta$ results in a reduced local thickness $h' = h_{nominal} - \\delta h_{nominal} = h_{nominal}(1-\\delta)$.\nThe peak pressure in this thinner region, $p'_{max}$, assuming the dynamics are locally governed by the same relation, is:\n$$ p'_{max} = \\frac{3\\mu U R^2}{(h')^3} = \\frac{3\\mu U R^2}{(h_{nominal}(1-\\delta))^3} = \\left( \\frac{3\\mu U R^2}{h_{nominal}^3} \\right) \\frac{1}{(1-\\delta)^3} $$\nRecognizing the term in parentheses as the nominal peak pressure, $p_{max,nominal}$, we find:\n$$ p'_{max} = \\frac{p_{max,nominal}}{(1-\\delta)^3} $$\nThis relation shows that the peak pressure is extremely sensitive to changes in thickness, scaling as the inverse cube of the gap height. Since $\\delta > 0$ for a reduction in thickness, the term $(1-\\delta)^3$ will be less than $1$, leading to a significant amplification of pressure. For the example $\\delta = 0.20$, the local pressure would be $p'_{max} = p_{max,nominal} / (1-0.20)^3 = p_{max,nominal} / (0.8)^3 \\approx 1.95 \\, p_{max,nominal}$. A $20\\%$ reduction in thickness nearly doubles the local pressure.

It is a standard, formalizable mechanics problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds by combining the fundamental equations of elasticity in cylindrical coordinates for a plane stress state.\n\nThe constitutive relations for linear-elastic, isotropic materials under plane stress ($\\sigma_z = 0$) relate strain components ($\\varepsilon_r$, $\\varepsilon_{\\theta}$) to stress components ($\\sigma_r$, $\\sigma_{\\theta}$):\n$$ \\varepsilon_{r} = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{r} - \\nu \\sigma_{\\theta}) $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_{\\theta} - \\nu \\sigma_{r}) $$\nSolving this system for the stresses yields:\n$$ \\sigma_{r} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\varepsilon_{r} + \\nu \\varepsilon_{\\theta}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\varepsilon_{\\theta} + \\nu \\varepsilon_{r}) $$\nUsing the given axisymmetric strain-displacement relations, $\\varepsilon_{r} = \\frac{du}{dr}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\theta} = \\frac{u}{r}$, we express the stresses in terms of the radial displacement $u(r)$:\n$$ \\sigma_{r}(r) = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{du}{dr} + \\nu \\frac{u}{r}\\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{u}{r} + \\nu \\frac{du}{dr}\\right) $$\nThese expressions are substituted into the radial equilibrium equation, $\\frac{d\\sigma_{r}}{dr} + \\frac{\\sigma_{r} - \\sigma_{\\theta}}{r} = 0$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr}\\left[\\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{du}{dr} + \\nu \\frac{u}{r}\\right)\\right] + \\frac{1}{r}\\left[\\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{du}{dr} + \\nu \\frac{u}{r}\\right) - \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\frac{u}{r} + \\nu \\frac{du}{dr}\\right)\\right] = 0 $$\nThe constant factor $\\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}$ cancels. Expanding the derivatives and simplifying the terms:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} + \\frac{\\nu}{r}\\frac{du}{dr} - \\frac{\\nu u}{r^2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{du}{dr}(1-\\nu) - \\frac{u}{r}(1-\\nu)\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{du}{dr} - \\frac{u}{r^2} = 0 $$\nMultiplying by $r^2$ gives a recognizable Cauchy-Euler equation:\n$$ r^2\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} + r\\frac{du}{dr} - u = 0 $$\nThe general solution to this differential equation is of the form $u(r) = C_1 r + C_2 r^{-1}$, where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration.\n\nTo determine $C_1$ and $C_2$, we apply the stress boundary conditions. First, we write the radial stress $\\sigma_r(r)$ in terms of $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dr} = C_1 - C_2 r^{-2} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{r}(r) = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left[(C_1 - C_2 r^{-2}) + \\nu(C_1 + C_2 r^{-2})\\right] = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left[C_1(1+\\nu) - C_2(1-\\nu)r^{-2}\\right] $$\nThe boundary conditions are $\\sigma_r(b) = 0$ and $\\sigma_r(a) = -p$:\n1.  At $r=b$: $C_1(1+\\nu) - C_2(1-\\nu)b^{-2} = 0 \\implies C_1(1+\\nu) = C_2(1-\\nu)b^{-2}$\n2.  At $r=a$: $\\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left[C_1(1+\\nu) - C_2(1-\\nu)a^{-2}\\right] = -p$\n\nSubstitute the result from (1) into (2):\n$$ \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left[C_2(1-\\nu)b^{-2} - C_2(1-\\nu)a^{-2}\\right] = -p $$\n$$ \\frac{E(1-\\nu)}{(1-\\nu)(1+\\nu)} C_2 \\left(b^{-2} - a^{-2}\\right) = -p $$\n$$ \\frac{E}{1+\\nu} C_2 \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2 b^2} = -p $$\nSolving for $C_2$:\n$$ C_2 = p \\frac{1+\\nu}{E} \\frac{a^2 b^2}{b^2 - a^2} $$\nSolving for $C_1$ using the relation from (1):\n$$ C_1 = C_2 \\frac{1-\\nu}{(1+\\nu)b^2} = \\left(p \\frac{1+\\nu}{E} \\frac{a^2 b^2}{b^2 - a^2}\\right) \\frac{1-\\nu}{(1+\\nu)b^2} = p \\frac{1-\\nu}{E} \\frac{a^2}{b^2 - a^2} $$\nThe problem requires a radial displacement $u(a) = sh$ at the inner boundary. We use the solution for $u(r)$ to relate $p$ to $h$:\n$$ u(a) = C_1 a + C_2 a^{-1} = \\left(p \\frac{1-\\nu}{E} \\frac{a^2}{b^2 - a^2}\\right)a + \\left(p \\frac{1+\\nu}{E} \\frac{a^2 b^2}{b^2 - a^2}\\right)a^{-1} $$\n$$ u(a) = \\frac{p a}{E(b^2-a^2)}\\left[(1-\\nu)a^2 + (1+\\nu)b^2\\right] $$\nSetting $u(a) = sh$ and solving for the pressure $p$:\n$$ p = \\frac{Esh(b^2-a^2)}{a\\left[a^2(1-\\nu) + b^2(1+\\nu)\\right]} $$\nThe failure criterion is based on the maximum circumferential stress, which occurs at the inner radius $r=a$. The circumferential stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}(r)$ is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta}(r) = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left[(C_1 + C_2 r^{-2}) + \\nu(C_1 - C_2 r^{-2})\\right] = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left[C_1(1+\\nu) + C_2(1-\\nu)r^{-2}\\right] $$\nAt $r=a$, using the expressions for $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta}(a) = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left[\\left(p \\frac{1-\\nu}{E} \\frac{a^2}{b^2-a^2}\\right)(1+\\nu) + \\left(p \\frac{1+\\nu}{E} \\frac{a^2 b^2}{b^2-a^2}\\right)(1-\\nu)a^{-2}\\right] $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta}(a) = \\frac{E(1-\\nu^2)}{E(1-\\nu^2)} \\frac{p}{b^2-a^2} \\left[a^2 + b^2\\right] = p \\frac{a^2+b^2}{b^2-a^2} $$\nThe maximum allowable hoop stress is $\\sigma_{\\text{allow}} = E \\varepsilon_b$. At the limit of safe operation ($h=h_{\\max}$), we have:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta, \\max} = \\sigma_{\\theta}(a) = E \\varepsilon_b $$\n$$ p \\frac{b^2+a^2}{b^2-a^2} = E \\varepsilon_b $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $p$ in terms of $h_{\\max}$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{E s h_{\\max} (b^2-a^2)}{a\\left[a^2(1-\\nu) + b^2(1+\\nu)\\right]}\\right) \\frac{b^2+a^2}{b^2-a^2} = E \\varepsilon_b $$\nThe terms $E$ and $(b^2-a^2)$ cancel out:\n$$ \\frac{s h_{\\max} (b^2+a^2)}{a\\left[a^2(1-\\nu) + b^2(1+\\nu)\\right]} = \\varepsilon_b $$\nFinally, we solve for $h_{\\max}$:\n$$ h_{\\max} = \\frac{a \\varepsilon_b}{s} \\frac{a^2(1-\\nu) + b^2(1+\\nu)}{a^2+b^2} $$\nThis expression can be rearranged for clarity:\n$$ h_{\\max} = \\frac{a \\varepsilon_b}{s} \\frac{(a^2+b^2) - \\nu(a^2-b^2)}{a^2+b^2} $$\n$$ h_{\\max} = \\frac{a \\varepsilon_b}{s} \\left(1 + \\nu \\frac{b^2-a^2}{a^2+b^2}\\right) $$\nThis is the final expression for the maximum safe undercut depth.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\frac{a \\varepsilon_{b}}{s} \\left( 1 + \\nu \\frac{b^2 - a^2}{a^2 + b^2} \\right) } $$", "id": "4707138"}]}
