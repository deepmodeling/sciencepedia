The polymerization proceeds via free-radical addition of methacrylate groups, consuming aliphatic carbon–carbon double bonds.

The validation of the problem confirms its scientific soundness, consistency, and well-posed nature. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the relationship between light absorbance and concentration is the Beer–Lambert law. For a given chemical species in a sample, its absorbance, $A$, at a specific wavenumber, $\\nu$, is directly proportional to its molar concentration, $c$, and the path length, $l$, of the light through the sample. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$A = \\epsilon \\cdot c \\cdot l$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the molar absorptivity (or extinction coefficient), a constant that is characteristic of the species at the given wavenumber. In FTIR spectroscopy, integrated peak area is used as the measure of absorbance, $A$, which is more robust than peak height.\n\nIn this problem, we are monitoring two specific absorption bands:\n1.  The aliphatic C=C double bond stretch near $1638\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, which is consumed during polymerization.\n2.  The aromatic C=C ring stretch near $1608\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, which is part of the Bis-GMA monomer backbone and remains unchanged during the reaction.\n\nLet $[M]$ be the concentration of the reactive aliphatic methacrylate C=C bonds, and let $[Ar]$ be the concentration of the non-reactive aromatic C=C bonds. Applying the Beer–Lambert law to each band, we have:\n$$A_{1638} = \\epsilon_{1638} [M] l$$\n$$A_{1608} = \\epsilon_{1608} [Ar] l$$\nwhere $A_{1638}$ and $A_{1608}$ are the integrated peak areas of the aliphatic and aromatic bands, respectively, and $\\epsilon_{1638}$ and $\\epsilon_{1608}$ are their respective molar absorptivities.\n\nThe use of the aromatic band as an internal reference is a critical aspect of this method. In ATR-FTIR, the effective path length, $l$, is not a fixed instrumental parameter. It depends on factors such as the refractive indices of the ATR crystal and the sample, and the quality of physical contact between them. These factors can vary between the pre-cure and post-cure measurements. To eliminate the influence of this variability, we take the ratio of the two absorbances from a single spectrum:\n$$\\frac{A_{1638}}{A_{1608}} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{1638} [M] l}{\\epsilon_{1608} [Ar] l}$$\nThe path length, $l$, being the same for both closely spaced wavenumbers within the same measurement, cancels out. This yields:\n$$\\frac{A_{1638}}{A_{1608}} = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_{1638}}{\\epsilon_{1608}}\\right) \\frac{[M]}{[Ar]}$$\nSince the concentration of the aromatic groups, $[Ar]$, is constant throughout the polymerization, and the molar absorptivities, $\\epsilon_{1638}$ and $\\epsilon_{1608}$, are also constants, the term $\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_{1638}}{\\epsilon_{1608} [Ar]}\\right)$ is a constant. Therefore, the ratio of the peak areas is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactive methacrylate groups, $[M]$:\n$$\\left( \\frac{A_{1638}}{A_{1608}} \\right) \\propto [M]$$\nThis proportionality is the basis for quantifying the change in monomer concentration.\n\nThe degree of conversion, $DC$, is defined as the fraction of the initial reactive groups that have polymerized. Let $[M]_0$ be the initial concentration of methacrylate groups (pre-cure) and $[M]_t$ be the concentration at some time $t$ during or after curing (post-cure). The $DC$ is given by:\n$$DC = \\frac{[M]_0 - [M]_t}{[M]_0} = 1 - \\frac{[M]_t}{[M]_0}$$\n\nUsing our established proportionality, we can relate the concentration ratio to the ratio of the absorbance ratios. Let $R$ be the absorbance ratio $A_{1638}/A_{1608}$. Then:\n$$[M]_0 \\propto R_0 = \\left( \\frac{A_{1638}^{(0)}}{A_{1608}^{(0)}} \\right)$$\n$$[M]_t \\propto R_t = \\left( \\frac{A_{1638}^{(t)}}{A_{1608}^{(t)}} \\right)$$\nwhere the superscripts $(0)$ and $(t)$ denote pre-cure and post-cure measurements, respectively.\n\nThe ratio of the concentrations is therefore equal to the ratio of these absorbance ratios:\n$$\\frac{[M]_t}{[M]_0} = \\frac{R_t}{R_0} = \\frac{\\left( A_{1638}^{(t)} / A_{1608}^{(t)} \\right)}{\\left( A_{1638}^{(0)} / A_{1608}^{(0)} \\right)}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression into the equation for $DC$, we obtain the final derived formula:\n$$DC = 1 - \\frac{\\left( A_{1638}^{(t)} / A_{1608}^{(t)} \\right)}{\\left( A_{1638}^{(0)} / A_{1608}^{(0)} \\right)}$$\n\nNow, we can evaluate this expression using the provided data:\n- Pre-cure aliphatic band area: $A_{1638}^{(0)} = 1.832$\n- Pre-cure aromatic band area: $A_{1608}^{(0)} = 0.914$\n- Post-cure aliphatic band area: $A_{1638}^{(t)} = 0.411$\n- Post-cure aromatic band area: $A_{1608}^{(t)} = 0.927$\n\nFirst, we calculate the pre-cure and post-cure absorbance ratios:\n$$R_0 = \\frac{A_{1638}^{(0)}}{A_{1608}^{(0)}} = \\frac{1.832}{0.914}$$\n$$R_t = \\frac{A_{1638}^{(t)}}{A_{1608}^{(t)}} = \\frac{0.411}{0.927}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these into the $DC$ formula:\n$$DC = 1 - \\frac{\\left( 0.411 / 0.927 \\right)}{\\left( 1.832 / 0.914 \\right)}$$\n$$DC = 1 - \\left( \\frac{0.411 \\times 0.914}{0.927 \\times 1.832} \\right)$$\n$$DC = 1 - \\left( \\frac{0.375654}{1.698024} \\right)$$\n$$DC = 1 - 0.221229...$$\n$$DC = 0.778770...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$DC \\approx 0.7788$$\nThis result represents a conversion of approximately $77.88\\%$ of the available methacrylate double bonds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7788}$$", "id": "4706547"}, {"introduction": "Polymerization shrinkage is an inherent and clinically significant consequence of converting discrete monomer molecules into a dense polymer network. This practice applies fundamental thermodynamic concepts, specifically the partial molar volume change associated with the reaction, to predict the macroscopic shrinkage of a composite material.

Express the final composite volumetric shrinkage as a decimal (dimensionless). Round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of volumetric shrinkage for a dental composite. The reasoning proceeds in two main steps: first, the shrinkage of the neat resin phase is determined, and second, this is used to calculate the shrinkage of the filler-containing composite.\n\n**Step 1: Volumetric Shrinkage of the Resin Phase**\n\nThe volumetric shrinkage originates from the conversion of monomer molecules into a polymer network. At constant temperature and pressure, the total volume change, $\\Delta V$, of a system is related to the change in the number of moles of a species, $\\Delta n$, and the partial molar volume change associated with that species' reaction, $\\Delta \\bar{v}$.\n\nThe problem provides the partial molar volume change for the conversion of one mole of methacrylate carbon-carbon double bonds ($\\mathrm{C=C}$) to single bonds ($\\mathrm{C-C}$): $\\Delta \\bar{v}_{\\mathrm{C=C}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{C-C}} = -23\\,\\mathrm{cm^3\\,mol^{-1}}$. This quantity represents the change in the total volume of the system per mole of reacted double bonds.\n\nThe initial concentration of these reactive double bonds in the pure resin phase is given as $c_{0} = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$. For dimensional consistency with the partial molar volume, this concentration must be converted to units of $\\mathrm{mol\\,cm^{-3}}$. Knowing that $1\\,\\mathrm{L} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{cm^3}$, the concentration is:\n$$c_{0} = 5.0\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{L}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{cm^3}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,cm^{-3}}$$\n\nThe degree of conversion, $\\alpha = 0.70$, is defined as the fraction of the initial double bonds that have reacted. For an arbitrary initial volume of resin, $V_{\\mathrm{resin},0}$, the initial number of moles of double bonds is $n_0 = c_0 V_{\\mathrm{resin},0}$. The number of moles that react is thus $\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{reacted}} = \\alpha n_0 = \\alpha c_0 V_{\\mathrm{resin},0}$.\n\nThe total volume change of the resin phase, $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{resin}}$, is the product of the number of moles reacted and the partial molar volume change per mole of reaction:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{resin}} = \\Delta n_{\\mathrm{reacted}} \\times \\Delta \\bar{v}_{\\mathrm{C=C}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{C-C}}$$\n$$\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{resin}} = (\\alpha c_0 V_{\\mathrm{resin},0}) \\times \\Delta \\bar{v}_{\\mathrm{C=C}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{C-C}}$$\n\nVolumetric shrinkage, $S$, is defined as the fractional decrease in volume, expressed as a positive number: $S = -\\frac{\\Delta V}{V_0}$. The volumetric shrinkage of the resin phase, $S_{\\mathrm{resin}}$, is therefore:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{resin}} = -\\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{resin}}}{V_{\\mathrm{resin},0}} = -\\frac{(\\alpha c_0 V_{\\mathrm{resin},0}) \\times \\Delta \\bar{v}_{\\mathrm{C=C}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{C-C}}}{V_{\\mathrm{resin},0}}$$\n\nThe initial volume $V_{\\mathrm{resin},0}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding a general expression for resin shrinkage that is independent of the absolute volume:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{resin}} = -\\alpha c_0 \\Delta \\bar{v}_{\\mathrm{C=C}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{C-C}}$$\n\nSubstituting the provided numerical values into this expression:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{resin}} = -(0.70) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,cm^{-3}}) \\times (-23\\,\\mathrm{cm^3\\,mol^{-1}})$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{resin}} = 0.70 \\times 5.0 \\times 23 \\times 10^{-3}$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{resin}} = 80.5 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.0805$$\nThis is the dimensionless volumetric shrinkage of the pure resin phase, corresponding to an $8.05\\%$ reduction in volume.\n\n**Step 2: Volumetric Shrinkage of the Composite**\n\nThe dental composite is a two-phase material, consisting of the polymerizing resin matrix and an inert inorganic filler. It is stated that the filler is non-reactive and non-shrinking. Consequently, the entire volume change of the composite is due to the shrinkage of the resin component alone.\n\nThe volume fraction of the filler is given as $\\phi_{\\mathrm{filler}} = 0.60$. The volume fraction of the resin, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{resin}}$, is the remaining fraction:\n$$\\phi_{\\mathrm{resin}} = 1 - \\phi_{\\mathrm{filler}} = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$$\n\nLet $V_{\\text{comp},0}$ be the initial total volume of the composite. The initial volume of the resin within the composite is $V_{\\mathrm{resin},0} = \\phi_{\\mathrm{resin}} V_{\\text{comp},0}$, and the volume of the filler is $V_{\\mathrm{filler}} = \\phi_{\\mathrm{filler}} V_{\\text{comp},0}$.\n\nUpon polymerization, only the resin volume changes. The change in the resin volume is $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{resin}} = -S_{\\mathrm{resin}} V_{\\mathrm{resin},0}$. Since the filler volume is constant, the total volume change of the composite, $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{comp}}$, is identical to the volume change of its resin component:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{comp}} = \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{resin}} = -S_{\\mathrm{resin}} V_{\\mathrm{resin},0}$$\n\nWe can express this in terms of the initial composite volume by substituting $V_{\\mathrm{resin},0} = \\phi_{\\mathrm{resin}} V_{\\text{comp},0}$:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{comp}} = -S_{\\mathrm{resin}} (\\phi_{\\mathrm{resin}} V_{\\text{comp},0})$$\n\nThe volumetric shrinkage of the composite, $S_{\\mathrm{comp}}$, is defined by the relation $S_{\\mathrm{comp}} = -\\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{comp}}}{V_{\\text{comp},0}}$. Substituting the expression for $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{comp}}$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{comp}} = -\\frac{-S_{\\mathrm{resin}} \\phi_{\\mathrm{resin}} V_{\\text{comp},0}}{V_{\\text{comp},0}}$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{comp}} = \\phi_{\\mathrm{resin}} S_{\\mathrm{resin}}$$\n\nThis result shows that the composite shrinkage is equal to the shrinkage of the pure resin scaled by the volume fraction of the resin.\n\nFinally, we substitute the calculated values for $\\phi_{\\mathrm{resin}}$ and $S_{\\mathrm{resin}}$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{comp}} = (0.40) \\times (0.0805)$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{comp}} = 0.0322$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The length of the remaining hardened cylinder is $L_{\\mathrm{res}} = 5.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This is the experimentally measured depth of gelation. This value is in reasonable agreement with our calculated $z_{\\mathrm{gel}} \\approx 4.99\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The test fundamentally measures the gel point. However, the standard reports a value $d_{\\mathrm{ISO}} = L_{\\mathrm{res}}/2 = 5.6\\,\\mathrm{mm} / 2 = 2.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Critically, the physical phenomenon being measured is gelation, which is not sufficient for mechanical performance under mastication. The test thus overestimates the depth of effective, load-bearing cure.\n\n*   **Vickers Microhardness Profile:** This test directly measures a mechanical property (hardness) that is strongly correlated to the degree of conversion, elastic modulus, and strength. The criterion for adequate performance is $\\mathrm{HV}(z)/\\mathrm{HV}(0) \\ge 0.80$. The required hardness is $0.80 \\times 80 = 64\\,\\mathrm{HV}$.\n    *   At $z = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $\\mathrm{HV} = 65$, which satisfies the criterion ($65/80 = 0.8125 \\ge 0.80$).\n    *   At $z = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $\\mathrm{HV} = 58$, which fails the criterion ($58/80 = 0.725  0.80$).\n    The depth of adequate mechanical performance, according to this direct mechanical measurement, is between $1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $2.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This experimental result is in excellent agreement with our calculated $z_{\\mathrm{mech}} \\approx 1.83\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nTherefore, the hardness profile provides a far more accurate and clinically relevant assessment of the material's fitness for purpose (withstanding masticatory loads) than the ISO scrape test.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The Vickers microhardness profile is more predictive: at $z = 2.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$, $H(2.8)$ is above $H_{\\mathrm{gel}}$ but below $H_{\\mathrm{mech}}$, and $\\mathrm{HV}(2.8)/\\mathrm{HV}(0) = 0.587  0.80$ indicates insufficient local conversion for mastication; the ISO 4049 depth reflects gelation and overestimates load-bearing performance.**\nLet's check the claims.\n*   Calculate $H(z=2.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm})$:\n    $H(2.8) = 24 \\exp(-0.60 \\times 2.8) = 24 \\exp(-1.68) \\approx 24 \\times 0.1864 = 4.47\\,\\mathrm{J/cm^2}$.\n    This value is indeed greater than $H_{\\mathrm{gel}} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{J/cm^2}$ and less than $H_{\\mathrm{mech}} = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{J/cm^2}$. The claim is correct.\n*   Calculate the hardness ratio at $z = 2.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$:\n    $\\mathrm{HV}(2.8)/\\mathrm{HV}(0) = 47/80 = 0.5875$. This matches the stated value of $0.587$ and is well below the $0.80$ threshold. The claim is correct.\n*   The conclusion that the microhardness profile is more predictive and that the ISO test measures gelation and overestimates performance is precisely what our analysis concluded.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The ISO 4049 scrape test is more predictive: resistance to scraping directly reflects bulk modulus under occlusal loading, whereas Vickers microhardness probes only a small surface volume and is not representative of mechanical performance at depth.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Resistance to scraping indicates the material has passed its gel point, which is a state of low mechanical integrity compared to a fully cured composite. It does not directly reflect the bulk modulus needed to withstand occlusal loads. A microhardness *profile*, with measurements taken at various depths, is an excellent method for characterizing the gradient of mechanical properties through the bulk of the material.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Both metrics are equivalent predictors because both increase monotonically with radiant exposure; as long as $I_0$ is high, either metric sufficiently characterizes performance.**\nThis is incorrect. While both phenomena depend on radiant exposure, they correspond to vastly different levels of it. The ISO test tracks the gelation threshold ($H_{\\mathrm{gel}} \\approx 1.2\\,\\mathrm{J/cm^2}$), while mechanical performance requires a much higher exposure ($H_{\\mathrm{mech}} = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{J/cm^2}$). The resulting depths are different ($z_{\\mathrm{gel}} \\approx 5.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ vs. $z_{\\mathrm{mech}} \\approx 1.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$). They are not equivalent predictors.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Vickers microhardness underestimates performance by sampling near-surface regions and failing to capture the bulk; ISO 4049 captures the entire cured length and is therefore the superior predictor.**\nThis statement misrepresents the situation. The Vickers microhardness *profile* successfully maps the decay of properties with depth, providing a conservative and realistic estimate of performance. The ISO 4049 test captures the entire *gelled* length ($L_{\\mathrm{res}} = 5.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), which is an *overestimation* of the *mechanically competent* length. Hence, the microhardness profile is the superior predictor, and the ISO test gives a dangerously optimistic result regarding load-bearing ability.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. For nanohybrids with sub-wavelength fillers, scattering is negligible, so Beer–Lambert attenuation does not limit cure; ISO 4049 depth is thus sufficient and microhardness adds no predictive value for masticatory performance.**\nThis statement is based on a false scientific premise. Fillers with sizes comparable to or on the order of the wavelength of light (submicron fillers for visible light) are strong Mie scatterers. Scattering is a primary contributor to light attenuation in filled composites, as explicitly noted in the problem statement itself (\"combined absorption and Mie scattering\"). The significant value of $\\mu = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{mm^{-1}}$ confirms that attenuation is not negligible; it is the central physical process limiting the depth of cure. The remainder of the statement is therefore invalid.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4706483"}]}
