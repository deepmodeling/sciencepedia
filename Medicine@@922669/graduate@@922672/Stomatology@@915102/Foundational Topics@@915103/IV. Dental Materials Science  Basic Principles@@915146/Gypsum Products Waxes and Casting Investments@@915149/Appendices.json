The assumptions of complete reaction, no entrapped air, and void formation from surplus water are standard idealizations used to construct a tractable model for calculating setting porosity. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and clear, objective definitions to derive a unique solution. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\nThe volumetric porosity fraction, $\\phi$, is defined as the ratio of the volume of the voids to the total volume of the dried cast.\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{V_{voids}}{V_{total}} $$\nThe voids are formed by the evaporation of surplus water, i.e., the water added in excess of the amount required for the chemical reaction. The total volume of the dried cast is the sum of the volume of the solid material (calcium sulfate dihydrate) and the volume of the voids.\n\nLet us establish a basis for our calculation by considering an arbitrary mass of calcium sulfate hemihydrate powder, denoted as $m_P$. The problem states the water-to-powder ratio, which we will denote as $R$.\n$$ R = \\frac{W}{P} = \\frac{m_W}{m_P} = 0.40 $$\nwhere $m_W$ is the total mass of water added. Thus, $m_W = R \\cdot m_P$.\n\nThe total mass of water, $m_W$, consists of two parts: the water that reacts stoichiometrically, $m_{W,stoi}$, and the surplus water that does not react, $m_{W,surplus}$.\n$$ m_W = m_{W,stoi} + m_{W,surplus} $$\nThe stoichiometric water requirement is given by the ratio $R_{stoi} = W/P_{stoi} = 0.186$.\n$$ R_{stoi} = \\frac{m_{W,stoi}}{m_P} = 0.186 $$\nTherefore, the mass of water that reacts is $m_{W,stoi} = R_{stoi} \\cdot m_P$.\n\nThe mass of the surplus water is the difference between the total water added and the stoichiometric water.\n$$ m_{W,surplus} = m_W - m_{W,stoi} = R \\cdot m_P - R_{stoi} \\cdot m_P = (R - R_{stoi}) \\cdot m_P $$\nAccording to the problem statement, this surplus water evaporates completely, leaving voids. The volume of these voids, $V_{voids}$, is equal to the volume occupied by the surplus water before evaporation. Using the definition of density, $\\rho = m/V$, we have:\n$$ V_{voids} = \\frac{m_{W,surplus}}{\\rho_w} = \\frac{(R - R_{stoi})m_P}{\\rho_w} $$\n\nNext, we determine the volume of the solid component of the final cast. The solid is formed by the complete reaction of the hemihydrate powder ($m_P$) with the stoichiometric amount of water ($m_{W,stoi}$). The product is calcium sulfate dihydrate, with mass $m_d$. By conservation of mass for the chemical reaction:\n$$ m_d = m_P + m_{W,stoi} = m_P + R_{stoi} \\cdot m_P = (1 + R_{stoi})m_P $$\nThe volume of this solid dihydrate, $V_d$, is:\n$$ V_d = \\frac{m_d}{\\rho_d} = \\frac{(1 + R_{stoi})m_P}{\\rho_d} $$\nwhere $\\rho_d$ is the true density of calcium sulfate dihydrate.\n\nThe total volume of the dried cast, $V_{total}$, is the sum of the volume of the solid dihydrate and the volume of the voids.\n$$ V_{total} = V_d + V_{voids} = \\frac{(1 + R_{stoi})m_P}{\\rho_d} + \\frac{(R - R_{stoi})m_P}{\\rho_w} $$\nNow we can write the expression for the porosity, $\\phi$.\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{V_{voids}}{V_{total}} = \\frac{\\frac{(R - R_{stoi})m_P}{\\rho_w}}{\\frac{(1 + R_{stoi})m_P}{\\rho_d} + \\frac{(R - R_{stoi})m_P}{\\rho_w}} $$\nThe term $m_P$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This correctly indicates that the porosity is an intrinsic property of the mixture composition and not dependent on the total amount of material used.\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{\\frac{R - R_{stoi}}{\\rho_w}}{\\frac{1 + R_{stoi}}{\\rho_d} + \\frac{R - R_{stoi}}{\\rho_w}} $$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$R = 0.40$\n$R_{stoi} = 0.186$\n$\\rho_d = 2.32\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$\n$\\rho_w = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator term:\n$$ \\frac{R - R_{stoi}}{\\rho_w} = \\frac{0.40 - 0.186}{1.00} = \\frac{0.214}{1.00} = 0.214 $$\nNext, calculate the terms in the denominator:\n$$ \\frac{1 + R_{stoi}}{\\rho_d} = \\frac{1 + 0.186}{2.32} = \\frac{1.186}{2.32} \\approx 0.5112069 $$\nThe second term in the denominator is identical to the numerator term.\n$$ \\frac{R - R_{stoi}}{\\rho_w} = 0.214 $$\nThe total denominator is the sum of these two terms:\n$$ V_{total}/m_P = 0.5112069 + 0.214 = 0.7252069 $$\nFinally, we compute the porosity $\\phi$:\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{0.214}{0.7252069} \\approx 0.2950882 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\phi \\approx 0.295 $$\nThis value represents the fraction of the total volume of the dried gypsum cast that is composed of pores resulting from the evaporation of excess water used for mixing.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.295}$$", "id": "4721842"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the porosity created by excess water, a second significant source of voids in a gypsum cast is entrained air.

For the same powder-liquid ratio and mixing protocol, vacuum mixing reduces the absolute air pressure above the slurry, thereby reducing the quantity of air that can be exsolved and retained as bubbles.\n\nAssume the following physically motivated model grounded in fundamental gas–liquid equilibrium and mass conservation:\n- The dissolved air concentration in the aqueous phase during mixing is proportional to the absolute air pressure by Henry’s law, so the moles of air available to exsolve scale linearly with the absolute pressure $P$.\n- For a fixed mixing time and hydrodynamic shear history, the entrained bubble volume fraction $\\phi_{\\mathrm{air}}(P)$ is proportional to the moles of air that exsolve.

This can be expressed mathematically as a linear relationship:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{air}}(P) = kP\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality. Physical consistency requires that at zero absolute pressure ($P=0$), no air can be entrained, so $\\phi_{\\mathrm{air}}(0)=0$, which is satisfied by this linear model.\n\nWe are given data for mixing at atmospheric pressure, which we denote as $P_0$.

The total porosity under vacuum, $\\phi_v$, is:\n$$\n\\phi_v = \\phi_0 - 0.03 = 0.18 - 0.03 = 0.15\n$$\nSo, the two porosity values we will use for the mechanical analysis are the initial porosity $\\phi_0 = 0.18$ and the vacuum-mixed porosity $\\phi_v = 0.15$.\n\nFinally, we are asked to apply an appropriate Gibson–Ashby relation to compute the change in compressive strength.

It provides a realistic scenario from the field of dental materials science (stomatology) and frames it with established principles from materials science and physics. The data provided are sufficient and physically plausible for the requested tasks. No flaws are identified. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires two distinct outputs: first, a concise explanation of the difference between wet and dry strength in set gypsum, and second, the calculation of the wet-to-dry strength ratio.\n\n### Part 1: Explanation of Wet Strength vs. Dry Strength\n\nThe strength of a set gypsum product, such as the dental stone described, is fundamentally determined by its microstructure. This microstructure consists of a network of interlocking, needle-like crystals of calcium sulfate dihydrate ($\\mathrm{CaSO}_{4}\\cdot 2\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$) that form during the setting reaction. The difference between wet strength and dry strength arises from the role of the water remaining in the pores of this crystalline network.\n\n**Wet Strength:**\nImmediately after the final set, the gypsum cast is in the \"wet\" state. Its microstructure contains a significant amount of \"excess\" water (water not consumed in the hydration reaction) that fills the micropores between the dihydrate crystals. The material's strength in this state, known as wet strength, derives from two principal sources:\n1.  **Crystal Interlocking:** The primary source of strength is the mechanical entanglement and interlocking of the newly formed $\\mathrm{CaSO}_{4}\\cdot 2\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$ crystals. This creates a rigid, three-dimensional framework.\n2.  **Capillary Forces:** As stated in the fundamental bases, the capillary water creates liquid bridges between crystals. This generates a negative capillary pressure, $p_{c} = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r}$, where $\\gamma$ is the surface tension of water, $\\theta$ is the contact angle, and $r$ is the pore radius. This pressure pulls the crystals together, inducing a state of effective compressive stress that adds to the material's apparent cohesion and resistance to tensile failure.\n\nHowever, the problem correctly notes that these capillary forces provide only \"short-range cohesive forces but do not create permanent solid-solid bonds.\" The presence of bulk water at the interfaces between many crystals prevents the formation of stronger, direct chemical or physical bonds. Furthermore, this water can act as a lubricant under shear stresses and may facilitate crack propagation through stress corrosion mechanisms, effectively limiting the overall strength.\n\n**Dry Strength:**\nAfter a period of drying, typically $24$ hours at ambient conditions as stated, the excess capillary water evaporates from the pores. This transition to the \"dry\" state leads to a significant increase in strength. The mechanism for this strengthening is not merely the removal of water but a fundamental change in the bonding between the crystals.\n1.  **Formation of Solid-Solid Bonds:** As the bulk water disappears, thin films of water remain at the contact points between adjacent crystals. This aqueous film is saturated with calcium and sulfate ions. As stated in the second fundamental basis, this environment facilitates \"dissolution-reprecipitation\" and \"secondary crystal growth.\" Smaller or highly stressed crystal features dissolve, and the ions reprecipitate in the lower-energy regions at the contact points, forming solid \"necks\" or sinter-like bonds of $\\mathrm{CaSO}_{4}\\cdot 2\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$.\n2.  **Improved Stress Transfer:** These newly formed solid-solid bonds dramatically increase the \"effective solid-solid bonded area per contact.\" A load applied to the dry cast is now transferred much more efficiently through these robust bonds, rather than being mediated by the weaker capillary forces or simple mechanical friction present in the wet state.\n\nAccording to the brittle failure criterion provided, macroscopic strength is elevated by increasing the stress required to propagate microcracks. The formation of larger, stronger bonded areas in the dry state achieves precisely this, arresting crack initiation and propagation more effectively than the microstructure of the wet state.\n\n**Conclusion of Explanation:**\nIn summary, wet strength is primarily a function of mechanical crystal interlocking, augmented by weak capillary forces. Dry strength is substantially higher because the evaporation of free water allows for secondary crystallization to occur at crystal-to-crystal contact points, creating strong, permanent solid-solid bonds. This transforms the microstructure from a weakly-cohered granular network into a more monolithic, bonded solid, greatly enhancing its load-bearing capacity and resistance to fracture.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of the Wet-to-Dry Strength Ratio\n\nThe problem provides the following values for the compressive strength of the specimen:\n- Wet compressive strength, $S_{\\mathrm{wet}} = 25\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n- Dry compressive strength, $S_{\\mathrm{dry}} = 75\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nThe wet-to-dry strength ratio is defined as the ratio of the wet strength to the dry strength, $\\frac{S_{\\mathrm{wet}}}{S_{\\mathrm{dry}}}$.\n\nWe substitute the given values into this definition:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{wet}}}{S_{\\mathrm{dry}}} = \\frac{25\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}{75\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}\n$$\nThe units of megapascals ($\\mathrm{MPa}$) in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving a dimensionless ratio.
