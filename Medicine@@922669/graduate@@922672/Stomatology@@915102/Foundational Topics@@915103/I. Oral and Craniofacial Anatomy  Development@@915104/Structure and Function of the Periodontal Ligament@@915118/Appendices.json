The final answer to be reported is the numerical value of $k$.\n\nFirst, we compute the apparent secant stiffness, $k$, defined as the ratio of the applied quasi-static load $F$ to the resulting axial displacement $\\delta$.\nThe given values are:\n$$F = 40\\ \\mathrm{N}$$\n$$\\delta = 80\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe problem requires the stiffness to be expressed in units of $\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.
