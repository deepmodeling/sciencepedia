The given functions for enamel thickness and secretion rate, as well as the concept of a moving front of cell differentiation, are standard in dental histology and anthropology. The numerical values are biologically plausible. The formulation of total formation time as the sum of initiation time and secretion duration is a fundamentally correct approach. The problem is sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for the maximum value of a function $f(x)$ on a closed, bounded interval $[0, 5.0]$. The function $f(x)$ is a sum and quotient of polynomials. The denominator of the rational term, $4.0 - 0.5x$, is zero only at $x=8.0$, which is outside the domain of interest $[0, 5.0]$. Therefore, $f(x)$ is continuous on this interval. By the Extreme Value Theorem, a maximum value must exist. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical language and provides all necessary quantitative information. It is free of subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\nThe total crown formation time for the secretory stage is given as the maximum of the function $f(x)$ over the domain $x \\in [0, 5.0]$. The function is:\n$$f(x) = \\frac{x}{v} + \\frac{1500 - 250x}{4.0 - 0.5x}$$\nThe constant $v$ is given as $0.0125 \\text{ mm day}^{-1}$. We can substitute this value into the function.\n$$v = 0.0125 = \\frac{1}{80} \\implies \\frac{1}{v} = 80$$\nThe units of $x/v$ are $(\\mathrm{mm}) / (\\mathrm{mm}/\\mathrm{day}) = \\mathrm{days}$.\nThe units of the second term are $(\\mu\\mathrm{m}) / (\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{day}) = \\mathrm{days}$. The function $f(x)$ correctly gives time in days.\n\nLet's simplify the fractional term:\n$$ \\frac{1500 - 250x}{4.0 - 0.5x} = \\frac{250(6-x)}{0.5(8-x)} = 500 \\frac{6-x}{8-x} $$\nSo, the function to be maximized is:\n$$ f(x) = 80x + 500 \\frac{6-x}{8-x} $$\ndefined on the closed interval $x \\in [0, 5.0]$.\n\nTo find the maximum, we must find the critical points of $f(x)$ by computing its derivative, $f'(x)$, and setting it to zero. We will then evaluate $f(x)$ at any critical points within the interval and at the endpoints of the interval, $x=0$ and $x=5.0$.\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$. We use the quotient rule for the second term:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{6-x}{8-x} \\right) = \\frac{(-1)(8-x) - (6-x)(-1)}{(8-x)^2} = \\frac{-8+x+6-x}{(8-x)^2} = \\frac{-2}{(8-x)^2} $$\nNow we can find $f'(x)$:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( 80x + 500 \\frac{6-x}{8-x} \\right) = 80 + 500 \\left( \\frac{-2}{(8-x)^2} \\right) $$\n$$ f'(x) = 80 - \\frac{1000}{(8-x)^2} $$\nTo find the critical points, we set $f'(x) = 0$:\n$$ 80 - \\frac{1000}{(8-x)^2} = 0 $$\n$$ 80 = \\frac{1000}{(8-x)^2} $$\n$$ (8-x)^2 = \\frac{1000}{80} = \\frac{100}{8} = \\frac{25}{2} $$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n$$ 8-x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{2}} = \\pm \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\pm \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} $$\nThis yields two possible values for $x$:\n$$ x = 8 - \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 8 + \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} $$\nWe must check which of these critical points lie within the domain $[0, 5.0]$.\nUsing the approximation $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.4142$:\n$$ \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx \\frac{5 \\times 1.4142}{2} = 3.5355 $$\nThe first critical point is $x_c = 8 - 3.5355 = 4.4645$. This value is in the interval $[0, 5.0]$.\nThe second critical point is $x = 8 + 3.5355 = 11.5355$. This value is outside the interval $[0, 5.0]$ and is not considered.\n\nThe only critical point in the domain is $x_c = 8 - \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. To determine if this corresponds to a maximum, we can examine the second derivative, $f''(x)$:\n$$ f''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( 80 - 1000(8-x)^{-2} \\right) = -1000(-2)(8-x)^{-3}(-1) = -\\frac{2000}{(8-x)^3} $$\nAt $x_c = 8 - \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, the term $8-x_c = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} > 0$. Thus, $(8-x_c)^3 > 0$, and $f''(x_c) < 0$. This confirms that $x_c$ is a local maximum.\n\nThe global maximum on the closed interval $[0, 5.0]$ must occur at either a critical point or at an endpoint. We compare the values of $f(x)$ at $x=0$, $x=5.0$, and $x_c$.\n\n1.  At $x=0$:\n    $$ f(0) = 80(0) + 500 \\frac{6-0}{8-0} = 500 \\times \\frac{6}{8} = 500 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 375 \\text{ days} $$\n\n2.  At $x=5.0$:\n    $$ f(5.0) = 80(5.0) + 500 \\frac{6-5.0}{8-5.0} = 400 + 500 \\frac{1}{3} = 400 + \\frac{500}{3} = \\frac{1200+500}{3} = \\frac{1700}{3} \\approx 566.67 \\text{ days} $$\n\n3.  At the critical point $x_c = 8 - \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}$:\n    We substitute this into the expression for $f(x)$. Note that $8-x_c = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $6-x_c = (8-x_c)-2 = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} - 2$.\n    $$ f(x_c) = 80 \\left( 8 - \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\right) + 500 \\frac{\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} - 2}{\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}} $$\n    $$ f(x_c) = 640 - 80\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2} + 500 \\left( 1 - \\frac{2}{\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}} \\right) $$\n    $$ f(x_c) = 640 - 200\\sqrt{2} + 500 - \\frac{2000}{5\\sqrt{2}} $$\n    $$ f(x_c) = 1140 - 200\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{400}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n    Since $\\frac{400}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{400\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 200\\sqrt{2}$, we have:\n    $$ f(x_c) = 1140 - 200\\sqrt{2} - 200\\sqrt{2} = 1140 - 400\\sqrt{2} $$\n    Numerically, this is:\n    $$ f(x_c) \\approx 1140 - 400(1.41421356) \\approx 1140 - 565.685424 = 574.314576 \\text{ days} $$\n\nComparing the three values:\n- $f(0) = 375$\n- $f(5.0) \\approx 566.67$\n- $f(x_c) \\approx 574.31$\n\nThe maximum value is $1140 - 400\\sqrt{2}$, which is approximately $574.314576$.\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe value $574.314576$ rounded to four significant figures is $574.3$.\n\nThe total crown formation time for the secretory stage is the maximum of $f(x)$, which is $574.3$ days.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{574.3}$$", "id": "4724100"}, {"introduction": "Enamel's exceptional hardness is a direct consequence of its high mineral content, but this composition is not uniform throughout the tissue.

Third, we will use this model to estimate the mineral volume fraction at the test site based on its calculated hardness.\n\nStep 1: Calculation of Vickers Hardness ($H_{test}$)\n\nThe Vickers hardness is defined as the applied force ($F$) divided by the surface area of the residual indentation ($A_s$).\n$$H_V = \\frac{F}{A_s}$$\nThe applied load is given in gram-force ($gf$) and must be converted to the SI unit of force, the Newton ($N$), using the provided conversion factor $1 \\, \\mathrm{gf} = 9.80665 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{N}$.\n$$F = 200 \\, \\mathrm{gf} \\times 9.80665 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{gf}} = 1.96133 \\, \\mathrm{N}$$\nThe indenter is an ideal Vickers pyramid with an angle of $\\theta = 136^{\\circ}$ between opposite faces.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires constructing a thermodynamically consistent argument for the dissolution or precipitation of enamel (hydroxyapatite) under conditions where $\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$ is the dominant phosphate species. This entails creating a net dissolution reaction involving $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and $\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$.\n\n**1. Derive the Overall Dissolution Reaction**\nWe start with the fundamental dissolution reaction and couple it with the relevant acid-base equilibria to eliminate product species ($\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$, $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$) in favor of the specified species ($\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$).\n\nThe primary equilibria are:\n(1) $\\mathrm{Ca}_{10}(\\mathrm{PO}_{4})_{6}(\\mathrm{OH})_{2}(\\mathrm{s}) \\rightleftharpoons 10\\,\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} + 6\\,\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-} + 2\\,\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$\n$K = K_{\\mathrm{sp}}$\n\n(2) $\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-} + \\mathrm{H}^{+} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$\nThis is the reverse of the third dissociation of phosphoric acid. Its equilibrium constant is $K = 1/K_{\\mathrm{a3}}$.\n\n(3) $\\mathrm{OH}^{-} + \\mathrm{H}^{+} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{l})$\nThis is the reverse of the autoionization of water. Its equilibrium constant is $K = 1/K_{\\mathrm{w}}$.\n\nTo obtain the desired overall reaction that produces $10\\,\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $6\\,\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$, we must consume the $6\\,\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ and $2\\,\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ produced in reaction (1). This is achieved by adding reaction (1), $6$ times reaction (2), and $2$ times reaction (3):\n\n$\\mathrm{Ca}_{10}(\\mathrm{PO}_{4})_{6}(\\mathrm{OH})_{2}(\\mathrm{s}) \\rightleftharpoons 10\\,\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} + 6\\,\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-} + 2\\,\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$\n$+ \\quad 6\\,(\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}) \\rightleftharpoons 6\\,\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$\n$+ \\quad 2\\,(\\mathrm{OH}^{-} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}) \\rightleftharpoons 2\\,\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{l})$\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSumming these reactions and canceling species that appear on both sides ($6\\,\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ and $2\\,\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$) yields the net reaction:\n$\\mathrm{Ca}_{10}(\\mathrm{PO}_{4})_{6}(\\mathrm{OH})_{2}(\\mathrm{s}) + 8\\,\\mathrm{H}^{+} \\rightleftharpoons 10\\,\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} + 6\\,\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-} + 2\\,\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{l})$\n\n**2. Derive the Equilibrium Constant ($K$) for the Overall Reaction**\nWhen chemical reactions are added, their equilibrium constants are multiplied. Let the equilibrium constant for the net reaction be $K_{\\text{net}}$.\n$$ K_{\\text{net}} = K_{\\mathrm{sp}} \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{K_{\\mathrm{a3}}}\\right)^6 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{K_{\\mathrm{w}}}\\right)^2 $$\nExpressing this in logarithmic form:\n$$ \\log_{10} K_{\\text{net}} = \\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{sp}} + 6 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{1}{K_{\\mathrm{a3}}}\\right) + 2 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{1}{K_{\\mathrm{w}}}\\right) $$\nUsing the definitions $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a3}} = -\\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{a3}}$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{w}} = -\\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{w}}$:\n$$ \\log_{10} K_{\\text{net}} = \\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{sp}} - 6 \\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{a3}} - 2 \\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{w}} $$\n$$ \\log_{10} K_{\\text{net}} = \\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{sp}} + 6\\,\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a3}} + 2\\,\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{w}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\log_{10} K_{\\text{net}} = -117.00 + 6(12.32) + 2(14.00) $$\n$$ \\log_{10} K_{\\text{net}} = -117.00 + 73.92 + 28.00 $$\n$$ \\log_{10} K_{\\text{net}} = -15.08 $$\n\n**3. Define the Reaction Quotient ($Q$) and Evaluate**\nFor the net reaction, the reaction quotient $Q$ is given by:\n$$ Q = \\frac{(a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}})^{10} (a_{\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}})^{6} (a_{\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}})^{2}}{(a_{\\mathrm{Ca}_{10}(\\mathrm{PO}_{4})_{6}(\\mathrm{OH})_{2}}) (a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}})^{8}} $$\nThe activities of the pure solid (hydroxyapatite) and the solvent (water in a dilute solution) are taken as $1$.\n$$ Q = \\frac{(a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}})^{10} (a_{\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}})^{6}}{(a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}})^{8}} $$\nUsing the given activities $a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}} = 10^{-3.8}$, $a_{\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}} = 10^{-3.5}$, and $a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}$:\n$$ Q = \\frac{(10^{-3.8})^{10} (10^{-3.5})^{6}}{(10^{-\\mathrm{pH}})^{8}} = \\frac{10^{-38} \\cdot 10^{-21}}{10^{-8\\,\\mathrm{pH}}} = \\frac{10^{-59}}{10^{-8\\,\\mathrm{pH}}} = 10^{-59 + 8\\,\\mathrm{pH}} $$\nIn logarithmic form:\n$$ \\log_{10} Q = -59 + 8\\,\\mathrm{pH} $$\n\n**4. Analyze Reaction Direction**\nThe direction of the reaction is determined by comparing $Q$ and $K_{\\text{net}}$ (or $\\log_{10} Q$ and $\\log_{10} K_{\\text{net}}$). The Gibbs free energy change is $\\Delta G = RT \\ln(Q/K_{\\text{net}})$.\n-   If $Q < K_{\\text{net}}$ ($\\log_{10} Q < \\log_{10} K_{\\text{net}}$), then $\\Delta G < 0$. The forward reaction (dissolution) is spontaneous.\n-   If $Q > K_{\\text{net}}$ ($\\log_{10} Q > \\log_{10} K_{\\text{net}}$), then $\\Delta G > 0$. The reverse reaction (precipitation) is spontaneous.\n-   If $Q = K_{\\text{net}}$ ($\\log_{10} Q = \\log_{10} K_{\\text{net}}$), then $\\Delta G = 0$. The system is at equilibrium.\n\nWe compare $\\log_{10} Q = -59 + 8\\,\\mathrm{pH}$ with $\\log_{10} K_{\\text{net}} = -15.08$.\n\n-   At $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.0$:\n    $\\log_{10} Q = -59 + 8(7.0) = -59 + 56 = -3.0$.\n    Since $-3.0 > -15.08$, we have $Q > K_{\\text{net}}$. The saliva is supersaturated, and there is a thermodynamic driving force for precipitation.\n\n-   At $\\mathrm{pH} = 5.5$:\n    $\\log_{10} Q = -59 + 8(5.5) = -59 + 44 = -15.0$.\n    Since $-15.0 \\approx -15.08$ (specifically, $-15.0 > -15.08$), we have $Q \\approx K_{\\text{net}}$. The system is very near equilibrium, slightly favoring precipitation.\n\n-   At $\\mathrm{pH} = 5.0$:\n    $\\log_{10} Q = -59 + 8(5.0) = -59 + 40 = -19.0$.\n    Since $-19.0 < -15.08$, we have $Q < K_{\\text{net}}$. The saliva is undersaturated, and there is a thermodynamic driving force for enamel dissolution.\n\n**5. Effect of changing $a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}$**\nThe reaction quotient is $Q = \\frac{(a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}})^{10} (a_{\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}})^{6}}{(a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}})^{8}}$. Increasing $a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}$ at a fixed pH (fixed $a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$) and fixed $a_{\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}}$ will increase the value of $Q$. An increase in $Q$ shifts the reaction to the left, favoring precipitation or reducing the tendency to dissolve. This is an application of Le Châtelier's principle.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Proposes the coupled dissolution reaction $\\mathrm{Ca}_{10}(\\mathrm{PO}_{4})_{6}(\\mathrm{OH})_{2}(\\mathrm{s}) + 8\\,\\mathrm{H}^{+} \\rightleftharpoons 10\\,\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} + 6\\,\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-} + 2\\,\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O}$; derives $\\log_{10} K = \\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{sp}} + 6\\,\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a3}} + 2\\,\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{w}}$, so $\\log_{10} K \\approx -15.08$ with the provided numbers; identifies $Q = \\dfrac{(a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}})^{10} (a_{\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}})^{6}}{(a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}})^{8}}$; and concludes that with $a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}} = 10^{-3.8}$ and $a_{\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}} = 10^{-3.5}$ one has $\\log_{10} Q = -59 + 8\\,\\mathrm{pH}$ so that at $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.0$ ($\\log_{10} Q = -3$) and $\\mathrm{pH} = 5.5$ ($\\log_{10} Q \\approx -15$) the system is at or above equilibrium for the forward (dissolution) reaction ($Q \\ge K$), favoring no net dissolution or net precipitation, whereas at $\\mathrm{pH} = 5.0$ ($\\log_{10} Q = -19$) one has $Q < K$ and $\\Delta G < 0$ for dissolution, so enamel dissolves; also correctly infers that increasing $a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}$ at fixed pH increases $Q$ and thus favors precipitation (or reduces the driving force for dissolution).**\n-   The proposed reaction is correct, as derived above.\n-   The derivation of $\\log_{10} K$ and its calculated value of $-15.08$ are correct.\n-   The expression for $Q$ and its evaluation as $\\log_{10} Q = -59 + 8\\,\\mathrm{pH}$ are correct.\n-   The calculated values of $\\log_{10} Q$ at $\\mathrm{pH} = \\{7.0, 5.5, 5.0\\}$ are correct.\n-   The conclusion for $\\mathrm{pH} = 5.0$ that enamel dissolves is correct.\n-   The conclusion that increasing $a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}$ favors precipitation is correct.\n-   The conclusion for $\\mathrm{pH} = 7.0$ and $\\mathrm{pH} = 5.5$ is that the system is \"at or above equilibrium ... favoring no net dissolution or net precipitation\". At $\\mathrm{pH} = 5.5$, the system is very near equilibrium, so this phrasing is reasonable. At $\\mathrm{pH}=7.0$, the system is strongly supersaturated ($\\log_{10} Q = -3.0$ vs $\\log_{10} K = -15.08$), strongly favoring precipitation. The phrase \"favoring no net ... net precipitation\" is inaccurate for this case. However, this is a minor flaw in the summary phrasing, whereas all the fundamental steps of the thermodynamic construction and calculation are perfectly executed. Compared to the other options, this one is overwhelmingly superior.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Proposes the reaction $\\mathrm{Ca}_{10}(\\mathrm{PO}_{4})_{6}(\\mathrm{OH})_{2}(\\mathrm{s}) + 6\\,\\mathrm{H}^{+} \\rightleftharpoons 10\\,\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} + 6\\,\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-} + 2\\,\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$; derives $\\log_{10} K = \\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{sp}} + 6\\,\\mathrm{p}K_{\\mathrm{a3}}$; takes $Q = \\dfrac{(a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}})^{10} (a_{\\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}})^{6}}{(a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}})^{6}}$; and concludes that lowering pH increases $Q$ so that lower pH promotes precipitation and higher pH promotes dissolution.**\n-   The proposed reaction is balanced but thermodynamically awkward as it mixes $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ as a reactant and product. The derivation of the overall reaction should eliminate linked species.\n-   The derivation of $K$ is incorrect because it fails to account for the protonation of the $2\\,\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ ions, which requires a term involving $K_{\\mathrm{w}}$.\n-   The expression for $Q$ is incorrect; it is missing the $(a_{\\mathrm{OH}^{-}})^2$ term in the numerator that corresponds to the proposed reaction.\n-   The final conclusion that lowering pH increases $Q$ is wrong based on their own (incorrect) formula for $Q$, where $Q \\propto 1/(a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}})^{6}$. Lowering pH increases $a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$, which would decrease $Q$, favoring dissolution, not precipitation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Uses only the neutral dissolution $\\mathrm{Ca}_{10}(\\mathrm{PO}_{4})_{6}(\\mathrm{OH})_{2}(\\mathrm{s}) \\rightleftharpoons 10\\,\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} + 6\\,\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-} + 2\\,\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ with $K_{\\mathrm{sp}}$; asserts that because $K_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ does not explicitly contain $a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$, pH has no thermodynamic effect on the dissolution/precipitation equilibrium and only $a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}$ matters.**\n-   This option makes a fundamental error in chemical principles. It fails to recognize that the activities of species in the $K_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ expression ($\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ and $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$) are themselves dependent on pH through coupled acid-base equilibria. Lowering pH consumes these product ions, shifting the dissolution equilibrium to the right (favoring dissolution) by Le Châtelier's principle.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Argues that because $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is a product of enamel dissolution, increasing $a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}$ at fixed pH increases the thermodynamic driving force for dissolution by Le Châtelier’s principle, hence higher $a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}$ promotes enamel loss even if all other activities are unchanged.**\n-   This option incorrectly applies Le Châtelier's principle. $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is a product of dissolution. Increasing the concentration (or activity) of a product shifts the equilibrium to the left, towards the reactants. This means it favors precipitation (the reverse of dissolution), not dissolution. The statement claims the opposite.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4724124"}]}
