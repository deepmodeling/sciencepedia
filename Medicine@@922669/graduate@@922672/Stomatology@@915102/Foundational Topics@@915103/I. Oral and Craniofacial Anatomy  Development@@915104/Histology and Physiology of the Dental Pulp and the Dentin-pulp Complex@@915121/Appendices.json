A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe fundamental principle governing the motion of a particle or a signal propagating at a constant velocity is the kinematic relation between distance, velocity, and time. The problem specifies starting from the differential form:\n$$v = \\frac{dx}{dt}$$\nwhere $v$ is the velocity, $x$ is the position, and $t$ is time. For a constant velocity $v$ over a path of length $L$, we can integrate this equation from the starting point ($x=0$ at $t=0$) to the endpoint ($x=L$ at time $t_{arrival}$):\n$$ \\int_0^{t_{arrival}} v \\, dt = \\int_0^L dx $$\n$$ v \\cdot t_{arrival} = L $$\nSolving for the arrival time, $t_{arrival}$, gives:\n$$ t_{arrival} = \\frac{L}{v} $$\nThis equation will be applied to both the A-delta ($\\text{A}\\delta$) fiber signal and the C fiber signal. Let $t_A$ and $t_C$ be the arrival times for the $\\text{A}\\delta$ and C fiber signals, respectively. The path length $L$ is common to both.\n\nThe arrival time for the $\\text{A}\\delta$ fiber signal, which propagates at velocity $v_A$, is:\n$$ t_A = \\frac{L}{v_A} $$\n\nThe arrival time for the C fiber signal, which propagates at velocity $v_C$, is:\n$$ t_C = \\frac{L}{v_C} $$\n\nThe difference in arrival times, or the latency difference $\\Delta t$, is the time difference between the slower signal (C fiber) and the faster signal ($\\text{A}\\delta$ fiber). Since $v_A > v_C$, it follows that $t_A  t_C$. Therefore, the latency difference is:\n$$ \\Delta t = t_C - t_A $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $t_C$ and $t_A$:\n$$ \\Delta t = \\frac{L}{v_C} - \\frac{L}{v_A} $$\nThis expression can be factored to provide the general relationship between latency difference, path length, and conduction velocities:\n$$ \\Delta t = L \\left( \\frac{1}{v_C} - \\frac{1}{v_A} \\right) $$\nThis is the required expression for the difference in arrival times.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for the given parameters. The parameters are:\n- $L = 30\\,\\text{mm}$\n- $v_A = 15\\,\\text{m/s}$\n- $v_C = 1\\,\\text{m/s}$\n\nFor dimensional consistency, all units must be converted to a standard system, such as the International System of Units (SI). The path length $L$ must be converted from millimeters ($\\text{mm}$) to meters ($\\text{m}$).\n$$ L = 30\\,\\text{mm} = 30 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m} = 0.030\\,\\text{m} $$\nThe velocities are already in SI units ($\\text{m/s}$).\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into the derived expression for $\\Delta t$:\n$$ \\Delta t = 0.030\\,\\text{m} \\left( \\frac{1}{1\\,\\text{m/s}} - \\frac{1}{15\\,\\text{m/s}} \\right) $$\nFirst, evaluate the term in the parentheses:\n$$ \\frac{1}{1} - \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{15}{15} - \\frac{1}{15} = \\frac{14}{15} $$\nThe units of this term are $\\text{s}/\\text{m}$.\nNow, multiply by the path length $L$:\n$$ \\Delta t = 0.030\\,\\text{m} \\times \\left( \\frac{14}{15} \\frac{\\text{s}}{\\text{m}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta t = \\frac{0.030 \\times 14}{15} \\,\\text{s} $$\n$$ \\Delta t = \\frac{0.42}{15} \\,\\text{s} $$\n$$ \\Delta t = 0.028\\,\\text{s} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in milliseconds ($\\text{ms}$). The conversion is $1\\,\\text{s} = 1000\\,\\text{ms}$.\n$$ \\Delta t = 0.028\\,\\text{s} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\text{ms}}{1\\,\\text{s}} = 28\\,\\text{ms} $$\nThe problem also requires the final answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The number $28$ has two significant figures (the digits $2$ and $8$). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe calculated latency difference is $28\\,\\text{ms}$, which represents the temporal separation between the arrival of the sharp, fast pain signal (carried by $\\text{A}\\delta$ fibers) and the dull, slow pain signal (carried by C fibers) at the central relay.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{28}\n$$", "id": "4724627"}, {"introduction": "The hydrodynamic theory is the leading explanation for dentin hypersensitivity, positing that fluid shifts within dentinal tubules stimulate nerve endings.

The biological context, the hydrodynamic theory of dentin sensitivity, is a well-established and dominant theory in stomatology. The problem provides all necessary information to derive the required relationship and calculate the ratio, and it contains no internal contradictions or scientifically unsound premises. The stated values for tubule radii are physiologically realistic. The problem is directly relevant to the histology and physiology of the dentin-pulp complex.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe problem describes a steady, fully developed, laminar flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid through a straight cylindrical tube. This is a classic fluid dynamics problem, the solution to which is the Hagen-Poiseuille flow profile. We will derive this from the fundamental governing equations.\n\nWe use a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, z)$, where the $z$-axis is aligned with the central axis of the tubule. The problem states the flow is steady and fully developed. This implies that the velocity vector $\\vec{v}$ has only a $z$-component, and this component depends only on the radial position $r$. Thus, $\\vec{v} = v_z(r) \\hat{k}$.\n\nThe governing equation for the motion of an incompressible Newtonian fluid is the Navier-Stokes equation. In cylindrical coordinates, the $z$-component of the momentum equation is:\n$$ \\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial t} + v_r \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r} + \\frac{v_\\theta}{r} \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial \\theta} + v_z \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} + \\mu \\left[ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial \\theta^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial z^2} \\right] $$\nGiven the assumptions:\n1.  **Steady flow**: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  **Axial flow**: $v_r = 0$ and $v_\\theta = 0$.\n3.  **Fully developed flow**: The velocity profile does not change along the $z$-axis, so $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0$.\n4.  **Axisymmetric flow**: The velocity does not depend on $\\theta$, so $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$.\n\nUnder these conditions, the left-hand side of the Navier-Stokes equation becomes zero. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{dP}{dz} + \\mu \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{d v_z}{dr}\\right) $$\nSince $v_z$ depends only on $r$ and $P$ depends only on $z$ (for a given $r$), the pressure gradient $\\frac{dP}{dz}$ must be a constant. The problem defines a constant pressure drop $\\Delta P$ over a length $L$. We can write this constant pressure gradient as $\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$. Substituting this into the simplified equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{d v_z}{dr}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{\\mu L} $$\nRearranging and integrating with respect to $r$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{d v_z}{dr}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{\\mu L} r $$\n$$ r\\frac{d v_z}{dr} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\mu L} r^2 + C_1 $$\nDividing by $r$ and integrating again:\n$$ \\frac{d v_z}{dr} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\mu L} r + \\frac{C_1}{r} $$\n$$ v_z(r) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} r^2 + C_1 \\ln(r) + C_2 $$\nWe apply the boundary conditions to determine the constants of integration, $C_1$ and $C_2$. Let the radius of the tubule be $R$.\n1.  The velocity must be finite at the centerline of the tubule ($r=0$). Since $\\ln(r) \\to -\\infty$ as $r \\to 0$, we must have $C_1 = 0$ for the velocity to remain physically meaningful.\n2.  The no-slip boundary condition states that the fluid velocity is zero at the tubule wall ($r=R$). So, $v_z(R) = 0$.\n\nApplying the second boundary condition with $C_1=0$:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} R^2 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{\\Delta P \\cdot R^2}{4\\mu L} $$\nSubstituting the constants back into the velocity profile equation yields the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$ v_z(r) = \\frac{\\Delta P \\cdot R^2}{4\\mu L} - \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} r^2 = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} (R^2 - r^2) $$\nThe volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is obtained by integrating the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the tubule. The differential area element in cylindrical coordinates is $dA = 2\\pi r dr$.\n$$ Q = \\int_A v_z(r) dA = \\int_0^R \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} (R^2 - r^2) (2\\pi r) dr $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{2\\pi \\Delta P}{4\\mu L} \\int_0^R (R^2 r - r^3) dr = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left[ \\frac{R^2 r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_0^R $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) $$\nThis gives the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi R^4}{8\\mu} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}\\right) $$\nFrom this equation, we see that the dependence of the volumetric flow rate $Q$ on the tubule radius $R$ is $Q \\propto R^4$, assuming the pressure gradient $\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$ and fluid viscosity $\\mu$ are constant.\n\nNow, we compute the ratio $Q_A / Q_B$ for the two surfaces. Using the problem's notation where the radius is denoted by $r$:\n$$ Q_A = \\frac{\\pi r_A^4}{8\\mu} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}\\right) $$\n$$ Q_B = \\frac{\\pi r_B^4}{8\\mu} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}\\right) $$\nThe problem states that $\\mu$, $L$, and $\\Delta P$ are identical for both tubules. Therefore, the ratio of the flow rates is:\n$$ \\frac{Q_A}{Q_B} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi r_A^4}{8\\mu} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}\\right)}{\\frac{\\pi r_B^4}{8\\mu} \\left(\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}\\right)} = \\left(\\frac{r_A}{r_B}\\right)^4 $$\nSubstituting the given values $r_A = 0.6\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ and $r_B = 0.3\\,\\mu\\text{m}$:\n$$ \\frac{Q_A}{Q_B} = \\left(\\frac{0.6}{0.3}\\right)^4 = (2)^4 = 16 $$\n\n## Discussion of Implications\n\nThe calculated ratio $Q_A/Q_B = 16$ demonstrates that the volumetric fluid flow through a dentinal tubule is exquisitely sensitive to its radius, scaling with the fourth power of the radius. A mere doubling of the tubule radius results in a sixteen-fold increase in fluid flow for a given pressure gradient. This has profound implications for dentin sensitivity, as explained by the hydrodynamic theory.\n\nThe hydrodynamic theory posits that dentin pain is initiated by the rapid movement of fluid within the dentinal tubules. External stimuli, such as thermal changes (causing expansion or contraction of the fluid), osmotic gradients (from sugary substances), or air blasts (causing evaporation and outward flow), create a pressure gradient across the length of the tubule, inducing fluid flow.\n\nThis fluid movement acts as a mechanical signal. The moving fluid exerts shear stress on and causes displacement of the odontoblast process, a cellular extension of the odontoblast that resides within the tubule. Odontoblasts are now recognized as sensory-receptor cells, not merely dentin-forming cells. Their membranes, as well as the membranes of closely associated afferent nerve terminals (A$\\delta$ fibers) in the pulp-dentin complex, are equipped with mechanosensitive ion channels, particularly from the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) family.\n\nThe result $Q_A > Q_B$ signifies that for the same stimulus, the fluid flow in the wider tubules of surface A is vastly greater than in the narrower tubules of surface B. This amplified fluid movement in wider tubules translates into a much stronger mechanical stimulation (higher shear stress and greater displacement) of the odontoblast process and nerve endings. This stronger stimulus is more likely to surpass the activation threshold of the TRP channels. Activation of these channels leads to an influx of ions (e.g., $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$), depolarization of the cell membrane, release of neurotransmitters such as adenosine triphosphate ($\\text{ATP}$) by the odontoblast, and ultimately the generation of an action potential in the associated A$\\delta$ nerve fiber. This signal is transmitted to the central nervous system and perceived as a sharp, well-localized pain.\n\nTherefore, dentin with wider, more patent tubules (like surface A) is predicted to be substantially more sensitive to hydrodynamic stimuli. This is consistent with clinical observations of dentin hypersensitivity, where the loss of protective enamel or cementum exposes dentin, and tubules are often pathologically widened. Conversely, treatments for hypersensitivity that aim to occlude or narrow the tubule orifices are effective precisely because they reduce the tubule radius, thereby drastically decreasing fluid flow according to the $Q \\propto r^4$ relationship, which diminishes the mechanical stimulus below the pain threshold.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16}$$", "id": "4724835"}, {"introduction": "Effective clinical practice relies on accurately interpreting diagnostic tests, which are rarely infallible.
