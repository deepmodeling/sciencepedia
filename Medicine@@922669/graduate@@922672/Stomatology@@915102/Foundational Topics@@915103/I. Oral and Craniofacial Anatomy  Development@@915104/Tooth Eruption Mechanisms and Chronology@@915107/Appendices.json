This problem explores the impact of a common endocrine disorder, hypothyroidism, on the local mechanism of tooth eruption. By applying a simplified linear model based on hypothetical clinical data, you will practice estimating the delay in tooth emergence, connecting a specific biomarker (free T$4$) to a predictable clinical outcome.

Normal reference intervals for this age are TSH $0.5$ to $4.5$ $\\text{mIU/L}$ and free T$_4$ $0.9$ to $1.7$ $\\text{ng/dL}$.

Epidemiologic data in untreated primary hypothyroidism show a mean delay of $6$ months in mandibular incisor eruption compared with euthyroid peers.\n\nAssume the following context-appropriate base: eruption proceeds along an alveolar pathway of approximately fixed distance, and near the physiologic range, the eruption velocity is proportional to an effective thyroid hormone activity index that can be approximated by the free T$_4$ level. Therefore, the expected time to eruption shifts approximately linearly with the deficit in free T$_4$ from the euthyroid mean in the same age group. For the euthyroid cohort mean, use free T$_4$ $=1.3$ $\\text{ng/dL}$, and for the hypothyroid cohort mean in the population study, use free T$_4$ $=0.7$ $\\text{ng/dL}$.
