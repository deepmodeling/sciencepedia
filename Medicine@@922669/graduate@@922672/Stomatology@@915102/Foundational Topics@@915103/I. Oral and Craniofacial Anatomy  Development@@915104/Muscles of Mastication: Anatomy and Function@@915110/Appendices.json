It is scientifically grounded in the principles of muscle biomechanics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and expressed in objective, formal language. The provided data are physically realistic for the anatomical structure in question.\n\nLet us proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires us to derive an expression for the axial force transmitted to the mandible, which we will denote as $F_{axial}$. We are given three key quantities: the physiological cross-sectional area ($\\text{PCSA}$), the specific tension ($\\sigma$), and the pennation angle ($\\theta$).\n\nFirst, we must determine the total force generated by the muscle fibers, which we will denote as $F_{fibers}$. The specific tension, $\\sigma$, is defined as the maximum isometric force per unit of fiber cross-sectional area. The physiological cross-sectional area, $\\text{PCSA}$, represents the total effective area of all muscle fibers. Therefore, the total force generated by the fibers, acting along their own orientation, is the product of the specific tension and the physiological cross-sectional area.\n\n$$F_{fibers} = \\sigma \\cdot \\text{PCSA}$$\n\nNext, we must consider the geometry of the pennate muscle. The fibers are oriented at a pennation angle, $\\theta$, relative to the axis of force transmission (the tendon, and in this case, the mandible). The force $F_{fibers}$ is a vector quantity directed along the fibers. The force transmitted to the mandible, $F_{axial}$, is the component of the total fiber force vector that is projected onto the mandible's axis.\n\nUsing standard vector resolution, the component of a force vector along an axis is found by multiplying the magnitude of the force by the cosine of the angle between the force vector and the axis. Here, the angle is the pennation angle, $\\theta$.\n\n$$F_{axial} = F_{fibers} \\cos(\\theta)$$\n\nBy substituting the expression for $F_{fibers}$ into this second equation, we arrive at the general analytic expression for the axial force in terms of the given parameters:\n\n$$F_{axial} = (\\sigma \\cdot \\text{PCSA}) \\cos(\\theta)$$\n\nThis is the required analytic expression.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values:\n- Physiological cross-sectional area, $\\text{PCSA} = 12 \\text{ cm}^{2}$\n- Specific tension, $\\sigma = 30 \\text{ N/cm}^{2}$\n- Pennation angle, $\\theta = 15^{\\circ}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$F_{axial} = (30 \\frac{\\text{N}}{\\text{cm}^{2}} \\cdot 12 \\text{ cm}^{2}) \\cos(15^{\\circ})$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the product within the parentheses, which represents the total force generated by the fibers, $F_{fibers}$:\n$$30 \\text{ N/cm}^{2} \\cdot 12 \\text{ cm}^{2} = 360 \\text{ N}$$\n\nSo, the expression simplifies to:\n$$F_{axial} = 360 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\cos(15^{\\circ})$$\n\nThe value of $\\cos(15^{\\circ})$ is approximately $0.9659258...$.\n$$F_{axial} \\approx 360 \\text{ N} \\cdot 0.9659258...$$\n$$F_{axial} \\approx 347.7333 \\text{ N}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

This exercise delves into the microscopic origins of this phenomenon—the sarcomere's length-tension relationship.
