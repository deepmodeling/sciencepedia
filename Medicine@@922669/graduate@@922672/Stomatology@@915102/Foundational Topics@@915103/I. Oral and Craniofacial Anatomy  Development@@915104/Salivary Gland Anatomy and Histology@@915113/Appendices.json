Correction for Tissue Shrinkage**\nThe problem states that histoprocessing introduces an isotropic linear shrinkage of $s = 0.13$. The relationship between the fresh (in vivo) linear dimension, $L_{\\text{fresh}}$, and the shrunken (section) linear dimension, $L_{\\text{sec}}$, is given by the principle:\n\n$$L_{\\text{sec}} = (1 - s) L_{\\text{fresh}}$$\n\nWe apply this principle to the diameter. The measured section diameter $D_{\\text{sec}}$ is the shrunken dimension. We need to find the true fresh diameter, $D_{\\text{fresh}}$.\n\n$$D_{\\text{sec}} = (1 - s) D_{\\text{fresh}}$$\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for $D_{\\text{fresh}}$:\n$$D_{\\text{fresh}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{sec}}}{1 - s}$$\n\nSubstituting the values for $D_{\\text{sec}}$ and $s$:\n$$D_{\\text{fresh}} = \\frac{1001 \\, \\mathrm{\\mu m}}{1 - 0.13} = \\frac{1001}{0.87} \\, \\mathrm{\\mu m}$$\n\n**3.

The volume $V$ of a sphere is a function of its radius $R$, given by $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$. The radius is half the diameter, so $R = \\frac{D}{2}$.

The ratio $Q/K_m$ has dimensions of (volume/time) / (moles/volume) = (volume)$^2$/(moles $\\cdot$ time). A dimensionless number ($1$) cannot be added to a quantity with physical dimensions. This violates the principle of dimensional homogeneity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. $C_{\\text{out}} = C_0 - \\dfrac{2 \\pi r L}{Q} \\, \\dfrac{J_{\\max} \\, C_0}{K_m + C_0}$**\nThis expression results from an invalid approximation. It assumes that the reabsorptive flux $J$ is constant along the entire length of the duct and is equal to its value at the entrance, $J(C_0) = J_{\\max} \\frac{C_0}{K_m + C_0}$. If this were true, the governing differential equation would be $\\frac{dC}{dx} = -\\frac{2 \\pi r}{Q} J(C_0)$. Integrating this would indeed yield the expression in option E. However, the flux $J(C)$ is a function of the local concentration $C(x)$, which decreases along the duct. Therefore, this approximation is only valid for a very short duct or very high flow rate, where $C_{\\text{out}} \\approx C_0$. It is not the general solution.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "5001854"}]}
