The language is precise and objective. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe net filtration pressure, denoted as $P_{net}$, across the capillary endothelium is determined by the balance of two opposing forces: the hydrostatic pressure gradient and the colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressure gradient. This relationship is quantified by the Starling equation.\n\nThe hydrostatic pressure gradient, $\\Delta P$, is the difference between the capillary hydrostatic pressure ($P_c$) and the interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure ($P_i$). This gradient drives fluid out of the capillary.\n$$\n\\Delta P = P_c - P_i\n$$\nThe colloid osmotic pressure gradient, $\\Delta \\pi$, is the difference between the capillary plasma oncotic pressure ($\\pi_c$) and the interstitial fluid oncotic pressure ($\\pi_i$). This gradient tends to draw fluid into the capillary.\n$$\n\\Delta \\pi = \\pi_c - \\pi_i\n$$\nHowever, the capillary wall is not perfectly impermeable to proteins. The reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$, accounts for this partial permeability. A value of $\\sigma = 1$ would represent a barrier completely impermeable to proteins, while $\\sigma = 0$ would represent a barrier freely permeable to them. The effective oncotic pressure gradient is therefore $\\sigma (\\pi_c - \\pi_i)$.\n\nThe net filtration pressure, $P_{net}$, is the difference between the hydrostatic pressure gradient pushing fluid out and the effective oncotic pressure gradient pulling fluid in. The problem specifies a sign convention where a positive $P_{net}$ indicates filtration (outward movement of fluid). This corresponds to the standard formulation of the Starling equation:\n$$\nP_{net} = (P_c - P_i) - \\sigma(\\pi_c - \\pi_i)\n$$\nWe now substitute the given values into this equation. All pressures are in units of mmHg.\n- $P_c = 25$\n- $P_i = 2$\n- $\\pi_c = 18$\n- $\\pi_i = 5$\n- $\\sigma = 0.9$\n\nSubstituting these values yields:\n$$\nP_{net} = (25 - 2) - 0.9 \\times (18 - 5)\n$$\nFirst, we compute the pressure differences inside the parentheses:\n$$\nP_{net} = (23) - 0.9 \\times (13)\n$$\nNext, we calculate the effective oncotic pressure term:\n$$\n0.9 \\times 13 = 11.7\n$$\nFinally, we compute the net pressure:\n$$\nP_{net} = 23 - 11.7 = 11.3\n$$\nThe resulting net filtration pressure is $11.3\\,\\text{mmHg}$. This positive value indicates that there is a net driving force favoring the movement of fluid from the capillary lumen into the gingival interstitium, a process known as filtration.
