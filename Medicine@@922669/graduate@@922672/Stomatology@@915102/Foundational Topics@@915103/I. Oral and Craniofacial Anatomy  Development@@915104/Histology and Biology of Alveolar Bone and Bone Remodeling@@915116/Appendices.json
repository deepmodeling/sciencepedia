Engineering strain is defined as the change in length, $\\Delta L$, divided by the original length, $L_0$.\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\Delta L}{L_0}\n$$\nIn the context of this problem, the system is modeled as a one-dimensional deformation across the interfacial woven bone layer.\n-   The \"change in length,\" $\\Delta L$, corresponds to the relative displacement between the implant surface and the surrounding mature bone. This is given as the peak amplitude of the axial micromotion, $A$. Thus, $\\Delta L = A$.\n-   The \"original length,\" $L_0$, over which this deformation occurs is the initial thickness of the interfacial woven bone layer, $t$. Thus, $L_0 = t$.\n\nThe problem states that the maximum principal strain amplitude is well-approximated by this engineering strain. Substituting the problem-specific variables into the general definition gives the relationship between micromotion amplitude and strain amplitude in the interfacial layer:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{A}{t}\n$$\nThe mechanobiological condition for lamellar bone maturation is that the strain amplitude must not exceed a critical value, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{crit}}$. The threshold case, which defines the boundary between maturation and non-maturation, occurs when the strain amplitude is exactly equal to this critical value. The micromotion amplitude that induces this critical strain is the critical micromotion amplitude, $A_{\\text{crit}}$.\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{crit}}}{t}\n$$\nThe problem asks for an expression for $A_{\\text{crit}}$. We can rearrange the equation by multiplying both sides by $t$:\n$$\nA_{\\text{crit}} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{crit}} \\cdot t\n$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the critical micromotion amplitude.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data.\nThe given values are:\n-   Interfacial thickness, $t = 150 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$.\n-   Critical strain amplitude, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{crit}} = 2000 \\text{ microstrain}$.\n\nThe unit 'microstrain' represents a strain value multiplied by $10^6$. Therefore, to obtain the dimensionless strain value, we must divide by $10^6$ (or multiply by $10^{-6}$).\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\text{crit}} = 2000 \\times 10^{-6} = 2 \\times 10^3 \\times 10^{-6} = 2 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nNow, substitute the numerical values for $\\varepsilon_{\\text{crit}}$ and $t$ into the derived expression for $A_{\\text{crit}}$:\n$$\nA_{\\text{crit}} = (2 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot (150 \\, \\mu\\text{m})\n$$\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$\nA_{\\text{crit}} = 300 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mu\\text{m}\n$$\n$$\nA_{\\text{crit}} = 0.3 \\, \\mu\\text{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
