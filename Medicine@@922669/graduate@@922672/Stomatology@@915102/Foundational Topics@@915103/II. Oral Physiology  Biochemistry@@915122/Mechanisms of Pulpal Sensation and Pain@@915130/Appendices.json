In an isothermal mammalian preparation at body temperature, this potential arises from selective permeability to ions and their concentration gradients. Consider a simplified bi-ionic membrane where chloride conductance is negligible at rest (assume $P_{\\mathrm{Cl}} \\approx 0$), and only potassium and sodium contribute. The intracellular and extracellular concentrations are $[K^{+}]_{i} = 140\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $[K^{+}]_{o} = 4\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $[Na^{+}]_{i} = 15\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, and $[Na^{+}]_{o} = 140\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.

The derivation begins from the fundamental principles of ion transport across a membrane under the influence of both concentration gradients and an electric field, as described by the Nernst-Planck equation.\n\nThe Nernst-Planck equation gives the flux density, $j_S$, of an ion species $S$ as a function of position $x$ across the membrane:\n$$j_S(x) = -D_S \\left( \\frac{dC_S(x)}{dx} + \\frac{z_S F}{RT} C_S(x) \\frac{d\\phi(x)}{dx} \\right)$$\nHere, $D_S$ is the diffusion coefficient of the ion in the membrane, $C_S(x)$ is its concentration at position $x$, $z_S$ is its valence, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\phi(x)$ is the electrical potential.\n\nThe Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) framework is based on the constant-field assumption, which posits that the electric field, $E = -d\\phi/dx$, is constant across the thickness of the membrane, $L$. Therefore, we can write $d\\phi/dx = -\\frac{V_m}{L}$, where $V_m = \\phi_{in} - \\phi_{out}$ is the total membrane potential difference. Under this assumption, and assuming a steady-state where the flux $j_S$ is constant for each ion, the Nernst-Planck equation can be integrated across the membrane (from $x=0$ at the outside to $x=L$ at the inside). This integration yields the GHK current equation for each ion species. For a generic cation with valence $z_S=+1$, the outward current $I_S$ is given by:\n$$I_S = P_S \\frac{F^2 V_m}{RT} \\frac{[S]_i - [S]_o \\exp(-F V_m/RT)}{1 - \\exp(-F V_m/RT)}$$\nwhere $P_S$ is the membrane permeability of ion $S$, and $[S]_i$ and $[S]_o$ are the intracellular and extracellular concentrations, respectively.\n\nThe problem states that at the resting potential, the net transmembrane ionic current is zero. Since we are considering only potassium ($K^+$) and sodium ($Na^+$) ions (with $z_K = +1$ and $z_{Na} = +1$), the zero-current condition is:\n$$I_{net} = I_K + I_{Na} = 0$$\nSubstituting the GHK current equation for each ion:\n$$P_K \\frac{F^2 V_m}{RT} \\frac{[K^{+}]_i - [K^{+}]_o \\exp(-F V_m/RT)}{1 - \\exp(-F V_m/RT)} + P_{Na} \\frac{F^2 V_m}{RT} \\frac{[Na^{+}]_i - [Na^{+}]_o \\exp(-F V_m/RT)}{1 - \\exp(-F V_m/RT)} = 0$$\nAssuming a non-zero resting potential ($V_m \\neq 0$), we can cancel the common factor $\\frac{F^2 V_m}{RT(1 - \\exp(-F V_m/RT))}$:\n$$P_K ([K^{+}]_i - [K^{+}]_o \\exp(-F V_m/RT)) + P_{Na} ([Na^{+}]_i - [Na^{+}]_o \\exp(-F V_m/RT)) = 0$$\nWe now rearrange this equation to solve for $V_m$.
