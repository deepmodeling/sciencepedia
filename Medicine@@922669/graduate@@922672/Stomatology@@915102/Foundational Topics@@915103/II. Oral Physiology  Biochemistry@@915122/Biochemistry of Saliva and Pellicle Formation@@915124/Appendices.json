It is given by the formula:\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i} c_i z_i^2$$\nwhere $c_i$ is the molar concentration of ion $i$ and $z_i$ is its charge number.\n\nThe artificial saliva contains three fully dissociated salts. We must first determine the molar concentrations of all individual ionic species present in the solution. The concentrations are given in millimolar ($\\mathrm{mM}$), which we convert to molar ($\\mathrm{M}$ or $\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$) for the calculation. $1\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$.\n\nThe given salt concentrations are:\n1.  Sodium chloride ($\\mathrm{NaCl}$): $c_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$\n2.

Sodium bicarbonate ($\\mathrm{NaHCO_3}$): $c_{\\mathrm{NaHCO_3}} = 15\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 0.015\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$\n\nSince the salts are fully dissociated, they contribute to the total ion concentrations as follows:\n- $\\mathrm{NaCl} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Na^+} + \\mathrm{Cl^-}$\n- $\\mathrm{KCl} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{K^+} + \\mathrm{Cl^-}$\n- $\\mathrm{NaHCO_3} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Na^+} + \\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$\n\nThe total molar concentration of each ion is the sum of its contributions from all sources:\n- Sodium ion ($\\mathrm{Na^+}$): $c_{\\mathrm{Na^+}} = c_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} + c_{\\mathrm{NaHCO_3}} = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}} + 0.015\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}} = 0.035\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$.

The charge is $z_{\\mathrm{K^+}} = +1$.\n- Chloride ion ($\\mathrm{Cl^-}$): $c_{\\mathrm{Cl^-}} = c_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} + c_{\\mathrm{KCl}} = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}} + 0.010\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}} = 0.030\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$.

The charge is $z_{\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}} = -1$.\n\nAs a check, we can verify the electroneutrality of the solution. The total concentration of positive charge is $c_{\\mathrm{Na^+}} \\cdot |z_{\\mathrm{Na^+}}| + c_{\\mathrm{K^+}} \\cdot |z_{\\mathrm{K^+}}| = (0.035 + 0.010)\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}} = 0.045\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$.

The solution is electroneutral, as required.\n\nNow, we calculate the ionic strength using the formula:\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ c_{\\mathrm{Na^+}} z_{\\mathrm{Na^+}}^2 + c_{\\mathrm{K^+}} z_{\\mathrm{K^+}}^2 + c_{\\mathrm{Cl^-}} z_{\\mathrm{Cl^-}}^2 + c_{\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}} z_{\\mathrm{HCO_3^-}}^2 \\right]$$\nSubstituting the concentrations and charges:\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (0.035\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}})(+1)^2 + (0.010\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}})(+1)^2 + (0.030\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}})(-1)^2 + (0.015\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}})(-1)^2 \\right]$$\nSince the square of the charge for all these monovalent ions is $1$, the calculation simplifies:\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 0.035 + 0.010 + 0.030 + 0.015 \\right)\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$$\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2} (0.090)\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$$\n$$I = 0.045\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$$\n\nThe second part of the problem concerns the Debye screening parameter, $\\kappa$, and the Debye length, $\\lambda_D$. Within the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann framework, the electrostatic potential $\\psi(r)$ at a distance $r$ from a point charge in an electrolyte is screened, decaying more rapidly than the simple Coulomb potential. The parameter $\\kappa$ characterizes this screening. It is related to the ionic strength $I$ by the expression:\n$$\\kappa^2 = \\frac{2 N_A e^2}{\\epsilon k_B T} I$$\nwhere $N_A$ is the Avogadro constant, $e$ is the elementary charge, $\\epsilon$ is the permittivity of the solvent (where $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0$, with $\\epsilon_r$ being the relative permittivity or dielectric constant and $\\epsilon_0$ being the permittivity of free space), $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe Debye length, $\\lambda_D$, is defined as the reciprocal of the Debye parameter, $\\lambda_D = 1/\\kappa$. It has units of length and represents the characteristic distance over which the electrostatic field of a charge is significantly screened by the surrounding mobile ions in the electrolyte. Using the expression for $\\kappa$, the Debye length is:\n$$\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon k_B T}{2 N_A e^2 I}}$$\nThis expression explicitly shows that the Debye length is inversely proportional to the square root of the ionic strength ($ \\lambda_D \\propto 1/\\sqrt{I} $).\n\nFinally, we reason about the influence of this screening on pellicle formation. The initial step in acquired enamel pellicle formation is the adsorption of salivary macromolecules (proteins, glycoproteins) onto the negatively charged hydroxyapatite surface of the enamel. This adsorption is primarily driven by electrostatic interactions between charged domains on the proteins and the charged surface.\n\nOur calculated ionic strength ($I = 0.045\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$) is physiologically significant. A higher ionic strength leads to a smaller Debye length $\\lambda_D$. For an aqueous solution at room temperature, a typical value of $\\lambda_D$ at this ionic strength is on the order of $1$ nanometer. This implies that the electrostatic forces between the enamel surface and approaching salivary proteins are strongly attenuated over distances greater than a few nanometers. The cloud of counter-ions (in this case, primarily $\\mathrm{Na^+}$ and $\\mathrm{K^+}$) effectively shields the negative charge of the hydroxyapatite surface. Consequently, long-range electrostatic attraction is weakened, and a protein must approach very close to the surface to form a stable electrostatic bond. This screening effect modulates the kinetics and thermodynamics of protein adsorption, influencing which proteins bind and how they are arranged, thereby governing the structure and function of the nascent pellicle.\n\nThe final required answer is the numerical value of the ionic strength in $\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$, rounded to three significant figures.\n$I = 0.045\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$. To three significant figures, this is $0.0450\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0450}$$", "id": "4695575"}, {"introduction": "With the electrostatic environment defined, we can now turn to the dynamics of pellicle assembly.
