A solution can be derived.\n\nStep 2: Derivation of the Expression for Salivary pH\n\nThe primary buffer system in saliva is the carbonic acid/bicarbonate system. The relevant equilibrium is:\n$$ \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + \\text{CO}_2 \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3 \\rightleftharpoons \\text{H}^{+} + \\text{HCO}_3^{-} $$\nIn physiological systems, the concentration of carbonic acid, $[\\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3]$, is much lower than that of dissolved carbon dioxide, $[\\text{CO}_2]_{\\text{aq}}$. Therefore, it is standard practice to combine them and use an apparent acid dissociation constant, $pK_1$, for the overall equilibrium from dissolved $\\text{CO}_2$ to bicarbonate.

Let the initial state be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final state by subscript $2$.\n\nThe initial $pH$ is:\n$$ \\text{pH}_1 = pK_1 + \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{[\\text{HCO}_3^{-}]_1}{\\alpha \\cdot p\\text{CO}_2} \\right) $$\nwhere $[\\text{HCO}_3^{-}]_1 = 20\\ \\text{mM}$.\n\nThe problem states that the bicarbonate concentration doubles, so $[\\text{HCO}_3^{-}]_2 = 2 \\cdot [\\text{HCO}_3^{-}]_1$. The partial pressure $p\\text{CO}_2$ and the constants $pK_1$ and $\\alpha$ remain unchanged.\n\nThe final $pH$ is:\n$$ \\text{pH}_2 = pK_1 + \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{[\\text{HCO}_3^{-}]_2}{\\alpha \\cdot p\\text{CO}_2} \\right) = pK_1 + \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{2 \\cdot [\\text{HCO}_3^{-}]_1}{\\alpha \\cdot p\\text{CO}_2} \\right) $$\nThe change in $pH$ is $\\Delta pH = \\text{pH}_2 - \\text{pH}_1$.\n$$ \\Delta pH = \\left[ pK_1 + \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{2 \\cdot [\\text{HCO}_3^{-}]_1}{\\alpha \\cdot p\\text{CO}_2} \\right) \\right] - \\left[ pK_1 + \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{[\\text{HCO}_3^{-}]_1}{\\alpha \\cdot p\\text{CO}_2} \\right) \\right] $$\nThe $pK_1$ terms cancel.
