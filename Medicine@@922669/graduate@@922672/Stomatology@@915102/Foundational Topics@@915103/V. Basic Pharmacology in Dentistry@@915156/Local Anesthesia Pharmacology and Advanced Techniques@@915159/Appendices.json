The solution involves two primary steps: first, converting the given percent concentrations into mass-per-volume units of milligrams-per-milliliter; and second, using this concentration to find the total mass of the solute in the specified volume.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\nA validation of the problem statement is conducted as a mandatory prerequisite.\n- **Extracted Givens**:\n    - The definition of weight per volume percent concentration is provided: a $c\\%$ solution contains $c$ grams of solute per $100$ milliliters of solution.\n    - The concentrations of four anesthetics are given: $2\\%$ lidocaine, $3\\%$ mepivacaine, $4\\%$ articaine, and $0.5\\%$ bupivacaine.\n    - The volume of a standard dental carpule is $V = 1.8$ milliliters.\n- **Validation Verdict**:\n    - The problem is **scientifically grounded**. The definition of percent concentration (w/v) is standard in pharmacology. The anesthetic concentrations and carpule volume are representative of those used in clinical dental practice.\n    - The problem is **well-posed**. It provides all necessary information and a clear objective, leading to a unique and stable solution.\n    - The problem is **objective** and free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\nBased on this analysis, the problem is deemed valid and a formal solution can be derived.\n\n**Derivation of a General Formula for Concentration in mg/mL**\n\nLet $c$ represent the numerical value of the percent concentration. According to the stated definition, a $c\\%$ solution has a concentration, which we will denote as $C_{\\%}$, given by:\n$$\nC_{\\%} = \\frac{c \\text{ grams}}{100 \\text{ milliliters}}\n$$\nThe task requires the concentration to be expressed in milligrams per milliliter ($\\text{mg}/\\text{mL}$). We use the conversion factor between grams and milligrams:\n$$\n1 \\text{ g} = 1000 \\text{ mg}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $C_{\\%}$, we perform a dimensional analysis to obtain the concentration in the desired units, which we denote $C_{\\text{mg/mL}}$:\n$$\nC_{\\text{mg/mL}} = \\frac{c \\text{ g}}{100 \\text{ mL}} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ mg}}{1 \\text{ g}}\n$$\nThe gram units ($g$) cancel, yielding:\n$$\nC_{\\text{mg/mL}} = \\frac{1000 \\cdot c}{100} \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}} = 10c \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}\n$$\nThis derived formula, $C_{\\text{mg/mL}} = 10c$, provides a direct method for converting any given percent concentration $c\\%$ into a concentration in milligrams per milliliter.\n\n**Application of the Formula to Specific Anesthetics**\n\nWe now apply this general formula to each of the four anesthetic solutions provided.\n\n- For **$2\\%$ lidocaine**, $c=2$. The concentration is:\n  $$C_{\\text{lido}} = 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}$$\n- For **$3\\%$ mepivacaine**, $c=3$. The concentration is:\n  $$C_{\\text{mepi}} = 10 \\times 3 = 30 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}$$\n- For **$4\\%$ articaine**, $c=4$. The concentration is:\n  $$C_{\\text{arti}} = 10 \\times 4 = 40 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}$$\n- For **$0.5\\%$ bupivacaine**, $c=0.5$.

We can express the concentration of the protonated form, $[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]$, in terms of the unprotonated form, $[\\mathrm{B}]$:\n$$[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{10^{pH - pK_{a}}} = [\\mathrm{B}] \\cdot 10^{-(pH - pK_{a})} = [\\mathrm{B}] \\cdot 10^{pK_{a} - pH}$$\nNow we substitute this expression for $[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]$ into the definition of the unionized fraction $f_{B}$:\n$$f_{B} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{B}] + [\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{B}] + [\\mathrm{B}] \\cdot 10^{pK_{a} - pH}}$$\nThe term $[\\mathrm{B}]$ is a common factor in the denominator and can be factored out:\n$$f_{B} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{B}] (1 + 10^{pK_{a} - pH})}$$\nCanceling the non-zero concentration $[\\mathrm{B}]$ from the numerator and denominator yields the desired expression for the unionized fraction:\n$$f_{B} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pK_{a} - pH}}$$\nThis expression gives $f_{B}$ solely in terms of the $pH$ of the medium and the $pK_{a}$ of the drug.\n\nNext, we evaluate $f_{B}$ for lidocaine, for which $pK_{a} = 7.9$, at the two specified $pH$ values.\n\nCase 1: Physiological tissue with $pH = 7.4$.\nThe difference in the exponent is $pK_{a} - pH = 7.9 - 7.4 = 0.5$.\nSubstituting this into our derived formula:\n$$f_{B}(pH=7.4) = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{0.5}}$$\nThe numerical value is:\n$$f_{B}(pH=7.4) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sqrt{10}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 3.16227766} = \\frac{1}{4.16227766} \\approx 0.24025307$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $0.2403$.\n\nCase 2: Inflamed tissue with $pH = 6.0$.\nThe difference in the exponent is $pK_{a} - pH = 7.9 - 6.0 = 1.9$.\nSubstituting this into our derived formula:\n$$f_{B}(pH=6.0) = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{1.9}}$$\nThe numerical value is:\n$$f_{B}(pH=6.0) \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 79.432823} = \\frac{1}{80.432823} \\approx 0.01243245$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $0.01243$.\n\nThe results demonstrate that the fraction of lidocaine in its lipid-soluble, unionized form is substantially diminished in the acidic environment of inflamed tissue ($f_{B} \\approx 1.24\\%$) compared to normal tissue ($f_{B} \\approx 24.0\\%$).

It describes a realistic and common clinical scenario in dentistry—failure to achieve profound pulpal anesthesia in a mandibular molar with irreversible pulpitis using a conventional inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB). The provided anatomical and pharmacological facts are scientifically sound and represent accepted knowledge in the field. The question asks for a rational, stepwise troubleshooting algorithm that adheres to principles of progressing from least to most invasive techniques while targeting the specific observed anesthetic deficits.\n\nThe clinical findings must be systematically analyzed to formulate a logical plan.\n1.  **Successful Anesthesia:** The patient reports lower lip numbness, and objective testing confirms buccal soft-tissue anesthesia. Lip numbness indicates that the anesthetic solution has reached the inferior alveolar nerve trunk, affecting its mental nerve branch. Successful anesthesia of the long buccal nerve is confirmed by buccal mucosal numbness.\n2.  **Failed Anesthesia:** The patient experiences tenderness on the lingual gingiva, which is innervated by the lingual nerve. This is an expected finding as the problem states no separate deposition was made for the lingual nerve. The primary failure is the sharp pain on dentin entry, which definitively confirms that the pulpal nerve fibers of tooth #30, supplied by the inferior alveolar nerve, are not adequately anesthetized. This is a classic presentation of a failed IANB, often complicated by the inflammatory state of irreversible pulpitis (a \"hot tooth\"), where local tissue acidosis and nerve sensitization make anesthesia more difficult.\n\nA scientifically grounded troubleshooting algorithm must address the identified deficits (lingual and pulpal) in a sequential manner that minimizes patient discomfort and risk, while maximizing the probability of success. The algorithm should prioritize targeted supplemental injections over repeating the initial block, per the problem's constraint to \"minimize unnecessary repeat IANBs\".\n\nThe logical progression is as follows:\n1.  **Address the failed pulpal anesthesia:** The most significant issue is the lack of pulpal anesthesia. Rather than repeating the entire IANB, which is invasive and may fail again for the same reason, a supplemental technique is indicated. The problem states that $4\\%$ articaine exhibits superior cortical penetration. Therefore, a buccal infiltration with $1.0\\text{–}1.7\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of $4\\%$ articaine with $1{:}100{,}000$ epinephrine adjacent to tooth #30 is the most rational first step. This technique delivers a high concentration of a highly lipid-soluble anesthetic directly to the periapical region, where it can diffuse through the relatively thin buccal cortical plate of the molar region to anesthetize the pulpal nerves. This is a well-established and effective method for supplementing a failed IANB.\n2.  **Address the failed lingual soft-tissue anesthesia:** The patient has confirmed sensitivity of the lingual gingiva. This must be addressed for procedural comfort (e.g., rubber dam clamp placement). A simple, low-volume ($0.3\\text{–}0.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$) lingual infiltration adjacent to the tooth is sufficient to block the terminal branches of the lingual nerve in that area. This is a minimally invasive and highly effective procedure for this specific deficit. It can be performed before or after the buccal infiltration.\n3.  **Address potential accessory innervation:** If pulpal anesthesia remains inadequate after the buccal infiltration, the next logical step is to consider accessory innervation, which is a known cause of IANB failure. The problem statement specifically mentions the nerve to mylohyoid. A targeted block of this nerve, by depositing a small volume of anesthetic ($0.3\\text{–}0.6\\,\\mathrm{mL}$) on the lingual aspect near the mylohyoid ridge, is the appropriate next step.\n4.  **Employ a rescue technique:** If all the preceding steps fail to achieve profound anesthesia, a final rescue technique is warranted. The problem statement identifies the intraligamentary (ILI) or periodontal ligament (PDL) injection as such a technique. This injection delivers a small amount of anesthetic ($0.2\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ per root) under pressure directly into the PDL space, forcing it towards the root apex. It is highly effective for single-tooth anesthesia but is considered more invasive and is reserved as a later step due to the high pressure required and potential for post-operative discomfort.\n\nBased on this derived algorithm, we can evaluate the provided options.\n\n**A. Perform a buccal infiltration adjacent to tooth #30 with $1.0\\text{–}1.7\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of $4\\%$ articaine with $1{:}100{,}000$ epinephrine; if lingual soft-tissue sensitivity persists, add a lingual infiltration of $0.3\\text{–}0.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of $2\\%$ lidocaine; if pulpal anesthesia remains inadequate, perform a mylohyoid nerve supplemental injection by depositing $0.3\\text{–}0.6\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ in the lingual sulcus at the level of the mylohyoid line adjacent to #30; if still inadequate, perform an intraligamentary injection of $0.2\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ per root at multiple sites around #30.**\nThis option perfectly matches the derived logical sequence. It begins with the most effective and appropriate supplemental injection for pulpal anesthesia (articaine buccal infiltration). It includes a necessary step to anesthetize the lingual tissues. It then proceeds to a targeted block for accessory innervation (mylohyoid) and concludes with a definitive rescue technique (ILI). This sequence adheres to the principles of being anatomically targeted, progressing from least to most invasive, and avoiding a repeat IANB. The specified anesthetics and volumes are clinically appropriate.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Begin with a lingual infiltration of $0.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of $2\\%$ lidocaine to address pulpal pain, then repeat the long buccal nerve block with $0.3\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, then repeat the IANB with another $1.8\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of $2\\%$ lidocaine, and finally use an intraligamentary injection of $0.2\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ per root if needed.**\nThis option contains several critical flaws. Firstly, a lingual infiltration does not primarily address pulpal pain; it anesthetizes the lingual soft tissues. Secondly, repeating the long buccal nerve block is redundant and illogical, as the problem states buccal anesthesia was already successfully achieved. Thirdly, it resorts to repeating the IANB, violating the instruction to minimize such repetitions, before attempting more conservative supplemental techniques.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Immediately perform intraligamentary injections around #30 delivering $0.2\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ per root, then follow with buccal infiltration of $1.0\\text{–}1.7\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of $4\\%$ articaine if pain persists, and omit mylohyoid or lingual supplemental injections because the intraligamentary technique should suffice.**\nThis option inverts the logical sequence by starting with the intraligamentary injection, a more invasive rescue technique, rather than a less invasive supplemental infiltration. Furthermore, it incorrectly suggests omitting the lingual infiltration, thereby failing to address the patient's confirmed lingual tenderness, which is necessary for procedural comfort.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Repeat the IANB using $3.6\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of $4\\%$ articaine with $1{:}100{,}000$ epinephrine to ensure higher concentration at the mandibular canal, omit buccal and lingual infiltrations, and proceed directly to intraligamentary injection only if the second block fails.**\nThis option's primary action is to repeat the IANB, which contradicts the problem's constraint to first attempt less invasive supplemental techniques. Using a double volume ($3.6\\,\\mathrm{mL}$) of anesthetic is aggressive and increases risk without guaranteed benefit over supplemental approaches. Critically, it omits the lingual infiltration, ignoring an observed clinical sign (lingual tenderness), and also omits the buccal infiltration, which is a primary evidence-based supplemental method.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nTherefore, option A provides the most rational, scientifically sound, and stepwise troubleshooting algorithm that addresses all clinical findings while adhering to the established principles and constraints.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4729655"}]}
