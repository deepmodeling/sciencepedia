By calculating the fractions of an acidic drug in its charged and uncharged forms in the stomach versus the intestine, you will discover that the site of maximal absorption is a trade-off between chemical favorability and physiological opportunity, specifically the vast difference in mucosal surface area.", "problem": "A Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) used in dental pain management is a weak acid with acid dissociation parameter $pK_a=4.5$. Consider oral absorption across two luminal environments: gastric fluid at $pH=2.0$ with an effective mucosal area $A_{\\mathrm{gas}}=0.25$ $\\mathrm{m}^2$, and intestinal fluid at $pH=6.5$ with an effective mucosal area $A_{\\mathrm{int}}=200$ $\\mathrm{m}^2$.

Express the final ratio as a dimensionless number (no units).", "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of acid-base chemistry and pharmacokinetics, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is formulated objectively.\n\nThe first step is to derive an expression for the unionized fraction of a weak acid as a function of $pH$ and $pK_a$. Let the weak acid be denoted by $HA$. In an aqueous solution, it dissociates according to the equilibrium:\n$$HA \\rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^-$$\nHere, $HA$ is the unionized form and $A^-$ is the ionized (conjugate base) form. The law of mass action for this equilibrium is described by the acid dissociation constant, $K_a$:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}$$\nwhere the square brackets denote molar concentrations.\n\nThe total concentration of the drug, $C_T$, is the sum of the concentrations of the unionized and ionized forms:\n$$C_T = [HA] + [A^-]$$\nThe concentration of the unionized form is $C_u = [HA]$ and the concentration of the ionized form is $C_i = [A^-]$.\n\nThe unionized fraction, $f_u$, is the ratio of the unionized concentration to the total concentration:\n$$f_u = \\frac{C_u}{C_T} = \\frac{[HA]}{[HA] + [A^-]}$$\nTo express $f_u$ in terms of $[H^+]$ and $K_a$, we first rearrange the $K_a$ expression to solve for $[A^-]$:\n$$[A^-] = K_a \\frac{[HA]}{[H^+]}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $f_u$:\n$$f_u = \\frac{[HA]}{[HA] + K_a \\frac{[HA]}{[H^+]}}$$\nDividing the numerator and the denominator by $[HA]$ (which is non-zero) yields:\n$$f_u = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{K_a}{[H^+]}}$$\nBy definition, $pH = -\\log_{10}([H^+])$ and $pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$. These can be rewritten as $[H^+] = 10^{-pH}$ and $K_a = 10^{-pK_a}$. Substituting these into the expression for $f_u$:\n$$f_u = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{10^{-pK_a}}{10^{-pH}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_a}}$$\nThis is the required expression for the unionized fraction.\n\nThe fraction ionized, $f_i$, is given by $f_i = 1 - f_u$.\n$$f_i = 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_a}} = \\frac{(1 + 10^{pH - pK_a}) - 1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_a}} = \\frac{10^{pH - pK_a}}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_a}}$$\n\nNext, we compute the fraction ionized in the two specified environments, using the given $pK_a = 4.5$.\n\nIn gastric fluid, $pH_{\\mathrm{gas}} = 2.0$. The exponent is $pH - pK_a = 2.0 - 4.5 = -2.5$.\nThe fraction ionized is:\n$$f_{i, \\mathrm{gas}} = \\frac{10^{-2.5}}{1 + 10^{-2.5}} \\approx \\frac{0.003162}{1 + 0.003162} \\approx 0.003152$$\nSo, approximately $0.3152\\%$ of the drug is ionized in the stomach.\n\nIn intestinal fluid, $pH_{\\mathrm{int}} = 6.5$. The exponent is $pH - pK_a = 6.5 - 4.5 = 2.0$.\nThe fraction ionized is:\n$$f_{i, \\mathrm{int}} = \\frac{10^{2.0}}{1 + 10^{2.0}} = \\frac{100}{101} \\approx 0.9901$$\nSo, approximately $99.01\\%$ of the drug is ionized in the intestine.\n\nNow, we determine the ratio of the absorption fluxes, $R = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{int}}}{J_{\\mathrm{gas}}}$. The diffusive flux $J$ is given by Fick's first law as $J = P \\, A \\, C_u$, where $P$ is the permeability coefficient, $A$ is the mucosal area, and $C_u$ is the unionized drug concentration. The problem states that only the unionized form is permeable, so using $C_u$ is correct.\n\nThe fluxes in the intestine and stomach are:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{int}} = P_{\\mathrm{int}} A_{\\mathrm{int}} C_{u, \\mathrm{int}}$$\n$$J_{\\mathrm{gas}} = P_{\\mathrm{gas}} A_{\\mathrm{gas}} C_{u, \\mathrm{gas}}$$\nThe ratio $R$ is:\n$$R = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{int}}}{J_{\\mathrm{gas}}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{int}} A_{\\mathrm{int}} C_{u, \\mathrm{int}}}{P_{\\mathrm{gas}} A_{\\mathrm{gas}} C_{u, \\mathrm{gas}}}$$\nThe problem states that $P$ is identical for both sites ($P_{\\mathrm{int}} = P_{\\mathrm{gas}} = P$). The unionized concentration can be expressed as $C_u = f_u C_T$, where $C_T$ is the total drug concentration, also stated to be the same in both compartments.\n$$R = \\frac{P A_{\\mathrm{int}} (f_{u, \\mathrm{int}} C_T)}{P A_{\\mathrm{gas}} (f_{u, \\mathrm{gas}} C_T)}$$\nThe terms $P$ and $C_T$ cancel, simplifying the ratio to:\n$$R = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{int}} f_{u, \\mathrm{int}}}{A_{\\mathrm{gas}} f_{u, \\mathrm{gas}}}$$\nWe need to calculate the unionized fractions, $f_u = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_a}}$.\n\nFor the gastric environment ($pH_{\\mathrm{gas}} = 2.0$):\n$$f_{u, \\mathrm{gas}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{2.0 - 4.5}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-2.5}}$$\nFor the intestinal environment ($pH_{\\mathrm{int}} = 6.5$):\n$$f_{u, \\mathrm{int}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{6.5 - 4.5}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{2.0}} = \\frac{1}{101}$$\nNow, substitute these fractions and the given areas ($A_{\\mathrm{int}} = 200 \\, \\mathrm{m}^2$ and $A_{\\mathrm{gas}} = 0.25 \\, \\mathrm{m}^2$) into the expression for $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{200}{0.25} \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{1}{101}}{\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-2.5}}}$$\nThe ratio of the areas is $\\frac{200}{0.25} = 800$.\n$$R = 800 \\cdot \\frac{1 + 10^{-2.5}}{101}$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$10^{-2.5} = 10^{-5/2} = 1/\\sqrt{10^5} \\approx 0.00316227766$\n$$R = 800 \\cdot \\frac{1 + 0.00316227766}{101} = 800 \\cdot \\frac{1.00316227766}{101}$$\n$$R \\approx 800 \\cdot 0.009932300$$\n$$R \\approx 7.9458398$$\nRounding the final value to $4$ significant figures, we get $R = 7.946$. This dimensionless ratio indicates that the absorption flux is nearly $8$ times greater in the intestine than in the stomach, despite the much lower fraction of unionized drug.

It presents a standard model of oral drug absorption and first-pass metabolism that is formalizable and solvable.\n\nWe begin by deriving the expression for oral bioavailability, $F$, from first principles of mass balance through a series of sequential processes. Let $D$ be the administered oral dose of the antimicrobial agent. The process of the drug reaching the systemic circulation can be modeled as a sequence of three steps, each with an associated fractional loss.\n\nFirst, the drug must be taken up from the gastrointestinal lumen into the enterocytes. The fraction of the administered dose that successfully completes this step is defined as $F_a$. Therefore, the mass of the drug, $M_1$, that enters the enterocytes is:\n$$M_1 = D \\times F_a$$\nThe mass lost due to incomplete uptake in the GI lumen is $D \\times (1 - F_a)$.\n\nSecond, the drug that has entered the enterocytes is subject to metabolism within these cells before it can pass into the portal circulation. The fraction of the drug entering the enterocytes that survives this \"gut-wall\" metabolism is defined as $F_g$. This is a conditional fraction. The mass of the drug, $M_2$, that reaches the portal vein is the mass that entered the enterocytes, $M_1$, multiplied by the fraction that escapes gut-wall metabolism, $F_g$:\n$$M_2 = M_1 \\times F_g = (D \\times F_a) \\times F_g$$\nThe mass lost to enterocytic metabolism, relative to the initial dose $D$, is $M_1 \\times (1 - F_g) = D \\times F_a \\times (1 - F_g)$.\n\nThird, the entire mass of the drug that reaches the portal vein, $M_2$, is presented to the liver. The liver removes a fraction of this incoming drug, a process quantified by the hepatic extraction ratio, $E_H$. The fraction of drug presented to the liver that is removed is $E_H$. Consequently, the fraction of drug that passes through the liver and enters the systemic circulation unchanged, often denoted as the hepatic availability $F_h$, is $(1 - E_H)$. The mass of the drug, $M_3$, that finally reaches the systemic circulation is the mass presented to the liver, $M_2$, multiplied by the fraction that escapes hepatic extraction:\n$$M_3 = M_2 \\times (1 - E_H) = (D \\times F_a \\times F_g) \\times (1 - E_H)$$\nThe mass lost to hepatic first-pass extraction, relative to the initial dose $D$, is $M_2 \\times E_H = D \\times F_a \\times F_g \\times E_H$.\n\nOral bioavailability, $F$, is defined as the fraction of the administered dose, $D$, that reaches the systemic circulation unchanged. Therefore, we have:\n$$F = \\frac{M_3}{D} = \\frac{D \\times F_a \\times F_g \\times (1 - E_H)}{D}$$\nThis simplifies to the fundamental equation for oral bioavailability under these assumptions:\n$$F = F_a \\times F_g \\times (1 - E_H)$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $F$ using the provided data: $F_a = 0.9$, $F_g = 0.8$, and $E_H = 0.5$.\n$$F = 0.9 \\times 0.8 \\times (1 - 0.5)$$\n$$F = 0.9 \\times 0.8 \\times 0.5$$\n$$F = 0.72 \\times 0.5$$\n$$F = 0.36$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures, so $F = 0.360$.\n\nNext, we determine which presystemic barrier is the dominant limiter of systemic exposure. To do this, we must partition the total lost fraction of the dose, which is $(1 - F)$, into contributions from each of the three barriers. The total lost fraction is $1 - 0.360 = 0.640$.\n\nLet $L_i$ be the fraction of the *administered dose* lost at barrier $i$.\n\n1.  **Barrier 1: Incomplete Gastrointestinal Uptake.** The fraction of the dose lost because it never enters the enterocytes is:\n    $$L_1 = 1 - F_a = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1$$\n\n2.  **Barrier 2: Enterocytic Metabolism.** This loss is conditional on the drug having been absorbed into the enterocytes. The fraction of the initial dose that is absorbed is $F_a$. Of this fraction, a portion $(1 - F_g)$ is metabolized. Thus, the fraction of the *administered dose* lost in the gut wall is:\n    $$L_2 = F_a \\times (1 - F_g) = 0.9 \\times (1 - 0.8) = 0.9 \\times 0.2 = 0.18$$\n\n3.  **Barrier 3: Hepatic First-Pass Extraction.** This loss is conditional on the drug surviving the first two barriers. The fraction of the initial dose that reaches the portal vein is $F_a \\times F_g$. The liver extracts a fraction $E_H$ of this amount. Thus, the fraction of the *administered dose* lost in the liver is:\n    $$L_3 = (F_a \\times F_g) \\times E_H = (0.9 \\times 0.8) \\times 0.5 = 0.72 \\times 0.5 = 0.36$$\n\nTo verify our partitioning, the sum of the lost fractions should equal the total lost fraction:\n$$L_{total} = L_1 + L_2 + L_3 = 0.1 + 0.18 + 0.36 = 0.64$$\nThis matches the previously calculated total loss of $1 - F = 0.640$.\n\nComparing the magnitudes of the fractional losses attributable to each barrier:\n-   Loss at GI uptake ($L_1$): $0.1$\n-   Loss at enterocytic metabolism ($L_2$): $0.18$\n-   Loss at hepatic extraction ($L_3$): $0.36$\n\nThe largest fraction of the dose is lost due to hepatic extraction ($0.36$).

Plasma samples are collected up to $72$ h post-dose for each period. Noncompartmental analysis yields the following observations, which are consistent across participants:\n\n- For IV dosing, the terminal half-life is approximately $18$ h.\n- For the immediate-release oral tablet, the observed terminal log-linear rate constant $λ_z$ is approximately $0.040$ h$^{-1}$, with a time to peak near $3$ h.\n- For the extended-release oral capsule, the observed terminal log-linear rate constant $λ_z$ is approximately $0.019$ h$^{-1}$, with a time to peak near $8$ h.\n- Across formulations, the dose-normalized area under the concentration–time curve ($\\mathrm{AUC}$/dose) differs by less than $10\\%$ on average.\n\nIn this context, “flip-flop kinetics” refers to the situation in which the apparent terminal decline after extravascular dosing is governed by absorption rather than elimination.

Select all that apply.\n\nA. The extended-release profile exhibits flip-flop kinetics because the absorption rate constant is smaller than the elimination rate constant, so the observed terminal rate $λ_z$ for the extended-release capsule reflects absorption; evidence includes $λ_z$ being smaller than the IV elimination rate and changing with formulation.\n\nB. Because the extended-release capsule shows a longer terminal half-life than IV dosing, doxycycline clearance is lower with the extended-release formulation than with IV dosing; therefore, the formulation changes systemic clearance.\n\nC.

The drug, dosages, formulations, study design, and observed parameters are realistic and scientifically plausible. The central concept, \"flip-flop kinetics,\" is a standard topic in PK. The field is correctly identified as stomatology, as doxycycline is used in periodontal disease management. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides sufficient quantitative and qualitative information to evaluate the statements. The data from the IV arm serves as the reference for the true elimination rate, which is essential for diagnosing flip-flop kinetics. The question is clear and answerable.\n- **Objectivity:** The language is technical and unbiased. All data are presented as experimental observations.\n- **Consistency and Completeness:** The data are internally consistent. The IV half-life of $18$ h corresponds to an elimination rate constant $k_e = \\ln(2)/18 \\approx 0.0385$ h$^{-1}$. The observed $λ_z$ for the IR tablet ($0.040$ h$^{-1}$) is consistent with this $k_e$, indicating a typical absorption-limited profile. The observed $λ_z$ for the ER capsule ($0.019$ h$^{-1}$) is significantly slower than $k_e$, suggesting a change in the rate-limiting process. The similar dose-normalized AUC across formulations indicates that clearance ($CL$) and bioavailability ($F$) are not significantly altered, which is a necessary condition for a straightforward interpretation of the rate constants. The problem is complete and consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Analysis**\n\nThe analysis is based on the one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. The plasma concentration $C(t)$ after an oral dose is described by:\n$$ C(t) = A (e^{-k_e t} - e^{-k_a t}) $$\nwhere $k_a$ is the first-order absorption rate constant and $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. The term $A$ is a hybrid constant. The terminal log-linear phase of the concentration-time profile is governed by the slower of the two processes. The observed terminal rate constant, $λ_z$, is therefore the minimum of $k_a$ and $k_e$:\n$$ λ_z = \\min(k_a, k_e) $$\n-   In **normal kinetics**, absorption is faster than elimination ($k_a > k_e$), so $λ_z = k_e$.\n-   In **flip-flop kinetics**, absorption is slower than elimination ($k_a < k_e$), so $λ_z = k_a$.\n\n**Analysis of Observations:**\n1.  **IV Data:** The intravenous administration allows for the direct determination of the elimination rate constant, $k_e$. A terminal half-life of $t_{1/2} = 18$ h gives:\n    $$ k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{18 \\text{ h}} \\approx 0.0385 \\text{ h}^{-1} $$\n    This is the true elimination rate constant for doxycycline in this population.\n\n2.  **IR Oral Data:** The observed terminal rate constant is $λ_z \\approx 0.040$ h$^{-1}$. Since $λ_{z,IR} \\approx k_e$, this represents a case of normal kinetics where $k_a > k_e$. The terminal slope reflects elimination.\n\n3.  **ER Oral Data:** The observed terminal rate constant is $λ_z \\approx 0.019$ h$^{-1}$. Here, we observe that $λ_{z,ER} < k_e$ (since $0.019 \\text{ h}^{-1} < 0.0385 \\text{ h}^{-1}$). This inequality can only be true if the terminal phase is governed by the absorption process. Thus, for the ER formulation, $λ_z = k_a \\approx 0.019$ h$^{-1}$. This is a classic case of flip-flop kinetics. The apparent half-life for the ER product is $t_{1/2,app} = \\ln(2)/λ_{z,ER} \\approx \\ln(2)/0.019 \\approx 36.5$ h, which is much longer than the true elimination half-life of $18$ h.\n\n4.  **AUC/dose Data:** The observation that $\\mathrm{AUC}$/dose is constant across formulations implies that $F/CL$ is constant. Since the IV route has a bioavailability $F=1$ by definition, we have $(\\mathrm{AUC}/\\text{Dose})_\\mathrm{IV} = 1/CL$. For the oral routes, $(\\mathrm{AUC}/\\text{Dose})_\\mathrm{oral} = F/CL$. The similarity in these values indicates that the oral bioavailability $F$ is high (close to $1$) and that the systemic clearance, $CL$, a physiological parameter, is not affected by the route of administration or the formulation. This supports the conclusion that the difference in terminal slopes is due to a change in the absorption rate ($k_a$), not the elimination rate ($k_e$) or clearance ($CL$).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The extended-release profile exhibits flip-flop kinetics because the absorption rate constant is smaller than the elimination rate constant, so the observed terminal rate $λ_z$ for the extended-release capsule reflects absorption; evidence includes $λ_z$ being smaller than the IV elimination rate and changing with formulation.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our analysis. The ER profile shows $λ_z \\approx 0.019$ h$^{-1}$, which is less than the true $k_e \\approx 0.0385$ h$^{-1}$ from IV data. This defines flip-flop kinetics, where $λ_z = k_a$. The evidence cited is also correct: $λ_z$ for ER is smaller than the IV elimination rate, and $λ_z$ itself changes from $\\approx 0.040$ h$^{-1}$ (for IR) to $\\approx 0.019$ h$^{-1}$ (for ER), while the true $k_e$ remains constant.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Because the extended-release capsule shows a longer terminal half-life than IV dosing, doxycycline clearance is lower with the extended-release formulation than with IV dosing; therefore, the formulation changes systemic clearance.**\nThis statement makes an incorrect inference. The ER capsule does show a longer *apparent* terminal half-life ($36.5$ h vs. $18$ h). However, in flip-flop kinetics, this half-life reflects absorption ($t_{1/2,app} = \\ln(2)/k_a$), not elimination. Systemic clearance ($CL$) is related to the true elimination rate constant ($CL = k_e \\cdot V$) and total exposure ($CL = F \\cdot \\text{Dose}/\\mathrm{AUC}$). The problem states that $\\mathrm{AUC}$/dose is nearly constant, implying that $CL$ is also constant. The formulation alters the input rate ($k_a$), not the physiological process of clearance.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. A definitive diagnostic for flip-flop is that the dose-normalized $\\mathrm{AUC}$/dose differs markedly between extended-release and IV dosing.**\nThis is false. The dose-normalized AUC, $\\mathrm{AUC}$/dose, is equal to $F/CL$. A marked difference would imply a difference in bioavailability ($F$) and/or clearance ($CL$). Flip-flop kinetics is a phenomenon related to the relative magnitudes of the rate constants $k_a$ and $k_e$. It is about the shape of the curve over time, not the total area under it. In this problem, the *lack* of difference in $\\mathrm{AUC}$/dose is a key piece of supporting evidence that allows for a clean diagnosis of flip-flop, as it rules out confounding changes in $F$ or $CL$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. If the extended-release formulation exhibits flip-flop, model-based deconvolution (for example, the Wagner–Nelson method) applied to the oral data will recover an absorption rate constant approximately equal to the observed terminal $λ_z$, and an elimination rate constant approximately equal to the IV elimination rate.**\nThis statement describes a valid analysis approach. Deconvolution methods like Wagner-Nelson are used to characterize the absorption process. These methods require an independent estimate of the true elimination rate constant, $k_e$, which is provided by the IV data ($k_e \\approx 0.0385$ h$^{-1}$). When this correct $k_e$ is used to deconvolve the ER oral data, the resulting absorption profile will be characterized by the absorption rate constant, $k_a$. Because the ER formulation exhibits flip-flop, we already established that its observed terminal rate is the absorption rate, i.e., $λ_{z,ER} = k_a$. Therefore, the $k_a$ recovered from deconvolution should indeed match the observed $λ_{z,ER}$. The second part of the statement is also correct in spirit: the overall modeling exercise relies on and is consistent with an elimination rate constant equal to the one found from the IV data. A comprehensive model fitting all data simultaneously would confirm a single $k_e$ across formulations and a $k_a$ for the ER formulation that equals its $λ_z$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. In flip-flop kinetics, computing the apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase as $V_z/F = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Dose}}{\\mathrm{AUC}}\\right)/λ_z$ will underestimate the true elimination-phase $V_z/F$.**\nThe apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase is given by the non-compartmental formula $V_z/F = (CL/F) / λ_z$. The \"true\" elimination-phase volume of distribution, which we can call $V/F$, is related to clearance by $CL/F = k_e \\cdot (V/F)$, so $V/F = (CL/F) / k_e$. In flip-flop kinetics, $λ_z = k_a$ and $k_a < k_e$. We compare the computed value $V_z/F = (CL/F) / k_a$ with the true value $V/F = (CL/F) / k_e$. Since $k_a < k_e$, the denominator $k_a$ is smaller, which makes the fraction $(CL/F)/k_a$ *larger* than $(CL/F)/k_e$. Therefore, $V_z/F > V/F$. The calculation overestimates, not underestimates, the true volume of distribution.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**F. A pragmatic clinical test for flip-flop with extended-release doxycycline is to coadminister a gastrointestinal prokinetic that accelerates absorption; if bioavailability is unchanged, an increase in the terminal $λ_z$ without a change in $\\mathrm{AUC}$/dose supports flip-flop behavior.**\nThis describes a valid experimental test. A GI prokinetic is expected to increase the rate of absorption, $k_a$.\n- If flip-flop kinetics is occurring, then $λ_z = k_a$. Increasing $k_a$ will cause a corresponding increase in the observed $λ_z$.\n- If normal kinetics were occurring, then $λ_z = k_e$. Increasing $k_a$ would have no effect on $λ_z$, as $k_e$ is a physiological property of the drug's elimination.\n- The condition that bioavailability is unchanged (confirmed by no change in $\\mathrm{AUC}$/dose) is crucial to ensure that the prokinetic is only affecting the rate, not the extent, of absorption, thus avoiding confounding factors.\nTherefore, observing an increase in $λ_z$ upon co-administration of a prokinetic is strong evidence for flip-flop kinetics.\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ADF}$$", "id": "4751270"}]}
