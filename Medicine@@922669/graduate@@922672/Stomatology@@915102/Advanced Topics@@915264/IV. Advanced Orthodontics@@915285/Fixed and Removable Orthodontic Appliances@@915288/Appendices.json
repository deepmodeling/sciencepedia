The problem states that the shear stress is uniformly distributed. Therefore, the shear stress at the adhesive-enamel interface is given by the equation:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{F}{A}\n$$\nwhere $F$ is the magnitude of the shear force and $A$ is the area of the bonded interface.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the given values are:\nThe applied horizontal force, $F = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\nThe nominal contact area, $A = 12\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$.\n\nTo maintain consistency with the SI units of stress, specifically Pascals ($\\mathrm{Pa}$, which are $\\mathrm{N/m^2}$), the area must be converted from square millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$) to square meters ($\\mathrm{m}^{2}$).

For such a system, an external force is divided equally among the components.\n\nThe force experienced by a single tooth, which we denote as $F_{tooth}$, is therefore:\n$$F_{tooth} = \\frac{F_{total}}{n}$$\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n$$F_{tooth} = \\frac{60 \\, \\text{gf}}{4} = 15 \\, \\text{gf}$$\nThe next step is to convert this force from the unit of gram-force ($\\text{gf}$) to the standard SI unit of force, the Newton ($\\text{N}$).

It is scientifically grounded in classical mechanics (Coulomb friction), well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and expressed in objective language. The scenario described is a standard, albeit simplified, representation of orthodontic tooth movement. We may now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities: the frictional force resisting the movement of an upper canine and the additional applied force required to overcome this friction to achieve a specified net force.\n\nFirst, let us define the variables based on the givens:\n- The normal contact force at the bracket–wire interface is $N = 5\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n- The kinetic coefficient of friction is $\\mu = 0.20$.\n- The target net distalization force is $F_{\\text{net,target}} = 150\\,\\text{grams-force}$.\n- The standard gravitational acceleration is $g = 9.80665\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$.\n\nThe motion is described as quasi-static sliding, where the resistance is governed by the Coulomb model for kinetic friction. The frictional force, $F_{\\mathrm{f}}$, opposes the motion and is given by the equation:\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{f}} = \\mu N $$\n\nThe total applied force, $F_{\\text{applied}}$, from the elastomeric chain is directed along the archwire. This force must overcome the opposing frictional force $F_{\\mathrm{f}}$ to produce a net force, $F_{\\text{net}}$, which is responsible for the biological response of tooth movement. The relationship between these forces is given by the force balance equation along the direction of motion:\n$$ F_{\\text{net}} = F_{\\text{applied}} - F_{\\mathrm{f}} $$\nor, rearranged for the applied force:\n$$ F_{\\text{applied}} = F_{\\text{net}} + F_{\\mathrm{f}} $$\n\n**1) Calculation of the Frictional Force ($F_{\\mathrm{f}}$)**\n\nUsing the provided formula and values for the frictional force:\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{f}} = \\mu N $$\nSubstituting the given values $\\mu = 0.20$ and $N = 5\\,\\mathrm{N}$:\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{f}} = (0.20) \\times (5\\,\\mathrm{N}) = 1\\,\\mathrm{N} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, we express the frictional force as:\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{f}} = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{N} $$\n\n**2) Calculation of the Additional Applied Force**\n\nThe second question asks for the \"additional applied force, beyond the $150$ grams-force net, required to maintain a net distalization of $150$ grams-force\". This quantity represents the portion of the total applied force that is \"lost\" to friction.\n\nFrom our force balance equation, $F_{\\text{applied}} = F_{\\text{net}} + F_{\\mathrm{f}}$, the total applied force is the sum of the desired net force and the force required to counteract friction. The \"additional\" force beyond the net force is the difference between the total applied force and the net force:\n$$ F_{\\text{additional}} = F_{\\text{applied}} - F_{\\text{net}} $$\nSubstituting $F_{\\text{applied}} = F_{\\text{net}} + F_{\\mathrm{f}}$ into this expression gives:\n$$ F_{\\text{additional}} = (F_{\\text{net}} + F_{\\mathrm{f}}) - F_{\\text{net}} = F_{\\mathrm{f}} $$\nThus, the additional applied force required to overcome friction is exactly equal to the frictional force itself. The target net force of $150$ grams-force, while defining the clinical goal, does not alter the magnitude of the frictional force that must be overcome. The conversion of grams-force to Newtons is not necessary to answer this part of the question.\n\nTherefore, the additional applied force is:\n$$ F_{\\text{additional}} = F_{\\mathrm{f}} = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{N} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as instructed:\n$$ F_{\\text{additional}} = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{N} $$\n\nBoth quantities are found to be $1.00\\,\\mathrm{N}$.
