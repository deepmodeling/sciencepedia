If the net moment is non-zero, the tooth will rotate.\n\nA single force $F$ applied to the crown of the tooth at a distance from the $C_{res}$ will generate a moment. The line of action of the retraction force $F$ is horizontal at the bracket level. The $C_{res}$ is located a perpendicular distance $d$ from this line of action. The distance is given as $d = 10\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nThis force $F$ creates a moment, $M_F$, about the $C_{res}$, with a magnitude given by:\n$$M_F = F \\cdot d$$\nThis moment would cause the tooth to rotate (in this case, the crown would tip in the direction of the force).\n\nTo counteract this rotational tendency and achieve pure translation, the clear aligner system must apply a counteracting couple of magnitude $M$. For the net moment about the $C_{res}$ to be zero, the magnitude of the applied couple $M$ must be equal to the magnitude of the moment generated by the force $F$.\n$$ \\sum M_{C_{res}} = 0 $$\n$$ M_F - M = 0 $$\n$$ M = M_F = F \\cdot d $$\nThis relationship is explicitly stated in the problem as the required moment-to-force ratio for translation: $M/F = d = 10\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nFirst, we must convert the force magnitude from grams-force to the standard SI unit of force, the Newton (N). The problem states the force magnitude is $150\\ \\mathrm{g}$ and provides the conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{g} = 9.80665\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n$$ F = 150 \\times (9.80665 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{N}) $$\n$$ F = 1.4709975\\,\\mathrm{N} $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the required couple magnitude $M$ using the distance $d=10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n$$ M = F \\cdot d $$\n$$ M = (1.4709975\\,\\mathrm{N}) \\times (10\\,\\mathrm{mm}) $$\n$$ M = 14.709975\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot mm} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ M \\approx 14.7\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot mm} $$\nThis is the magnitude of the couple that the clear aligner must generate to ensure the maxillary canine undergoes pure translational movement, without any rotation, under the specified retraction force.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{14.7}$$", "id": "4703519"}, {"introduction": "Effective orthodontic treatment requires not just applying forces, but precisely predicting the resulting tooth movement.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe analysis begins by determining the net force and net moment acting on the tooth at its Center of Resistance ($C_{res}$). The tooth is modeled as a rigid body.\n\n1.  **Net Force and Moment:**\n    A single horizontal force $F$ is applied at a distance $d$ coronal to the $C_{res}$. This force system is statically equivalent to a force $F$ acting at the $C_{res}$ and a moment (couple) about the $C_{res}$. Let's establish a sign convention. We define the distal direction as positive for forces. We define a moment that causes the crown to tip distally (a clockwise rotation) as positive. The force $F$ is applied at a distance $d$ from the $C_{res}$, creating a moment $M_F = F \\cdot d$. This moment is positive according to our convention. The aligner provides a counteracting couple $M$, which must therefore be in the opposite direction (counter-clockwise) and will be treated as negative in the sum.\n\n    The net force acting at the $C_{res}$ is simply the applied force $F$:\n    $$F_{\\mathrm{net}} = F$$\n    The net moment about the $C_{res}$, $M_{C_{res}}$, is the sum of the moment from the applied force and the couple from the aligner:\n    $$M_{C_{res}} = F \\cdot d - M$$\n\n2.  **Tooth Displacement (Kinematics):**\n    The PDL's response is modeled as linear elastic, described by the compliance constants $k_t$ and $k_r$.\n    The translational displacement $\\delta$ of the $C_{res}$ is proportional to the net force:\n    $$\\delta = k_t \\cdot F_{\\mathrm{net}} = k_t \\cdot F$$\n    The rotational displacement $\\theta$ about the $C_{res}$ is proportional to the net moment:\n    $$\\theta = k_r \\cdot M_{C_{res}} = k_r (F \\cdot d - M)$$\n\n3.  **Center of Rotation ($C_{rot}$):**\n    The Center of Rotation ($C_{rot}$) is the point in the body that has zero velocity at a given instant. For small displacements, it's the point with zero displacement. The horizontal displacement $u(y)$ of any point on the tooth's long axis at a signed distance $y$ from the $C_{res}$ (apical is positive) is the sum of the translation of the $C_{res}$ and the displacement due to rotation about the $C_{res}$. A positive (clockwise) rotation $\\theta$ will cause a point at a positive (apical) $y$ to move in the negative horizontal direction.\n    $$u(y) = \\delta - y \\cdot \\theta$$\n    The $C_{rot}$ is located at the position $y$ where $u(y) = 0$.\n    $$0 = \\delta - y \\cdot \\theta$$\n    Solving for $y$ gives the location of the $C_{rot}$:\n    $$y = \\frac{\\delta}{\\theta}$$\n\n4.  **Expression for y:**\n    Substituting the expressions for $\\delta$ and $\\theta$ into the equation for $y$:\n    $$y = \\frac{k_t \\cdot F}{k_r (F \\cdot d - M)}$$\n    This is the expression for $y$ in terms of the requested variables. To facilitate calculation, we can divide the numerator and denominator by $F$:\n    $$y = \\frac{k_t}{k_r (d - M/F)}$$\n\n5.  **Numerical Calculation:**\n    We substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression:\n    - $k_t = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{mm/N}$\n    - $k_r = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{rad/(N \\cdot mm)}$\n    - $d = 12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n    - $M/F = 7\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n\n    $$y = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\cdot (12 - 7)}$$\n    $$y = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\cdot 5}$$\n    $$y = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-3}}$$\n    $$y = 0.6 \\times 10^{(-2 - (-3))} = 0.6 \\times 10^1 = 6$$\n    The location of the $C_{rot}$ is $y = 6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Since the apical direction is positive, this means the $C_{rot}$ is $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ apical to the $C_{res}$. The problem requires rounding to four significant figures, so the result is $y = 6.000\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n6.  **Clinical Interpretation:**\n    The problem provides the distance from the $C_{res}$ to the root apex as $L_{\\mathrm{apex}} = 6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Our calculated $C_{rot}$ location is $y = 6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This means the center of rotation is located exactly at the root apex.\n    This type of tooth movement, where the root apex remains stationary while the crown moves, is defined as **controlled tipping**.\n\n    - If $y$ were between $0$ and the crown, it would be uncontrolled tipping.\n    - If $y$ were at infinity (which would happen if $\\theta=0$, i.e., $d = M/F$), it would be pure translation (bodily movement).\n    - If $y$ were located at the crown level or beyond, it would be root movement.\n\n    Our result $y = L_{\\mathrm{apex}}$ precisely matches the condition for controlled tipping.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{6.000}\n$$", "id": "4703432"}, {"introduction": "A perfectly designed orthodontic force system is only effective if it can be maintained over time.

The couple moment $M$ is given as constant. The force $F(t)$ is given by the first-order decay equation:\n$$F(t) = F_{0} e^{-kt}$$\nTherefore, the $M/F$ ratio at any time $t$ is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{M}{F}\\right)(t) = \\frac{M}{F(t)} = \\frac{M}{F_{0} e^{-kt}} = \\left(\\frac{M}{F_{0}}\\right) e^{kt} $$\n\nLet's evaluate the initial $M/F$ ratio at $t=0$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{M}{F}\\right)(0) = \\frac{M}{F_{0}} = \\frac{12.0\\,\\mathrm{N \\cdot mm}}{1.20\\,\\mathrm{N}} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nThis initial ratio is equal to the desired distance $d_{\\mathrm{CR}} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This confirms that the system is correctly configured for pure translation at the moment the elastics are placed ($t=0$).\n\nThe problem defines the threshold for significant loss of control as a $10 \\%$ deviation from the target value, $d_{\\mathrm{CR}}$. Since the force $F(t)$ decreases with time, the ratio $(M/F)(t)$ will increase with time. We are therefore interested in the upper boundary:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{M}{F}\\right)_{\\text{max}} = d_{\\mathrm{CR}} + 0.10 \\times d_{\\mathrm{CR}} = 1.10 \\times d_{\\mathrm{CR}} $$\nSubstituting the value of $d_{\\mathrm{CR}}$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{M}{F}\\right)_{\\text{max}} = 1.10 \\times 10.0\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 11.0\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\n\nWe must now find the time $t = t^{\\ast}$ at which the $M/F$ ratio reaches this value:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{M}{F}\\right)(t^{\\ast}) = 11.0\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nUsing our expression for the time-dependent $M/F$ ratio:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{M}{F_{0}}\\right) e^{kt^{\\ast}} = 11.0\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nSince we calculated $(M/F_0) = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, we can substitute this into the equation:\n$$ (10.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}) e^{kt^{\\ast}} = 11.0\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nDividing both sides by $10.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ gives:\n$$ e^{kt^{\\ast}} = \\frac{11.0}{10.0} = 1.10 $$\nTo solve for $t^{\\ast}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln(e^{kt^{\\ast}}) = \\ln(1.10) $$\n$$ kt^{\\ast} = \\ln(1.10) $$\nNow, we can isolate $t^{\\ast}$:\n$$ t^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\ln(1.10)}{k} $$\nSubstituting the given value for the rate constant, $k = 0.030\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$:\n$$ t^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\ln(1.10)}{0.030\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}} $$\nUsing the value $\\ln(1.10) \\approx 0.09531$:\n$$ t^{\\ast} \\approx \\frac{0.09531}{0.030\\,\\mathrm{h}} \\approx 3.177\\,\\mathrm{h} $$\nThe monitoring interval should be at or before this time to prevent significant loss of control.
