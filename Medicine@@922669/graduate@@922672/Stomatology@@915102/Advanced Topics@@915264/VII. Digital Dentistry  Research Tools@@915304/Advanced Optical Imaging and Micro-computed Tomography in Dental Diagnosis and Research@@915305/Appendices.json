The system consists of a point-like X-ray source, a planar detector, and an object placed between them. The derivation will be based on the principles of ray geometry and the properties of similar triangles.\n\nFirst, we establish the geometric configuration. Let the X-ray source be a point $S$. The central axis of the cone beam is a line passing through $S$ and oriented perpendicularly to the detector plane. The object is positioned along this axis. The source-object distance, denoted as $\\mathrm{SOD}$, is the perpendicular distance from the source $S$ to the plane of the object being imaged. The source-detector distance, denoted as $\\mathrm{SDD}$, is the perpendicular distance from the source $S$ to the detector plane. The detector consists of an array of pixels, each with a uniform lateral dimension, or pixel pitch, denoted by $p$.\n\nThe problem states that the reconstructed voxel size, $\\Delta x$, is determined by the detector sampling projected back onto the object plane. Consider a single detector pixel of width $p$. The boundaries of this pixel define two rays originating from the point source $S$. These two rays pass through the object plane. The lateral separation of these two rays at the object plane defines the corresponding object-space voxel edge length, $\\Delta x$.\n\nWe can model this situation using two similar triangles. Both triangles share a common vertex at the source $S$.\nThe first triangle is formed by the source $S$ and the voxel edge of length $\\Delta x$ in the object plane. The height of this triangle is the perpendicular distance from the vertex $S$ to its base, which is the source-object distance, $\\mathrm{SOD}$.\nThe second triangle is formed by the source $S$ and the corresponding pixel edge of length $p$ on the detector plane. The height of this triangle is the perpendicular distance from the vertex $S$ to its base, which is the source-detector distance, $\\mathrm{SDD}$.\n\nSince the object plane and the detector plane are parallel, the bases of these two triangles (of lengths $\\Delta x$ and $p$) are parallel. Therefore, the two triangles are similar.\n\nFrom the property of similar triangles, the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides is constant. Specifically, the ratio of the length of the base to the height is the same for both triangles.\nThis can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{base}_1}{\\text{height}_1} = \\frac{\\text{base}_2}{\\text{height}_2}\n$$\nSubstituting the parameters from our geometric setup:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\mathrm{SOD}} = \\frac{p}{\\mathrm{SDD}}\n$$\nOur goal is to find an analytic expression for the object-space voxel edge length, $\\Delta x$. We can rearrange the equation by multiplying both sides by $\\mathrm{SOD}$:\n$$\n\\Delta x = p \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{SOD}}{\\mathrm{SDD}} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the derived analytic expression for $\\Delta x$ in terms of $p$, $\\mathrm{SOD}$, and $\\mathrm{SDD}$. The term $\\frac{\\mathrm{SDD}}{\\mathrm{SOD}}$ is known as the geometric magnification, $M$. The derived expression can also be written as $\\Delta x = \\frac{p}{M}$, which shows that the voxel size in the object is the pixel size at the detector divided by the magnification.\n\nNext, we must evaluate this expression for the given numerical values:\nDetector pixel pitch, $p = 50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nSource-object distance, $\\mathrm{SOD} = 50\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\nSource-detector distance, $\\mathrm{SDD} = 200\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nBefore substituting these values, we must ensure unit consistency. The ratio $\\frac{\\mathrm{SOD}}{\\mathrm{SDD}}$ is dimensionless as long as both distances are in the same units.\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{SOD}}{\\mathrm{SDD}} = \\frac{50\\ \\mathrm{mm}}{200\\ \\mathrm{mm}} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\n$$\nNow, we can calculate $\\Delta x$.

Provide the final numerical results only. Angles, if any appear in your derivation, should be in radians.", "solution": "**1. Lateral Resolution ($\\Delta x$)**\n\nThe lateral resolution is determined by the size of the focused spot. The Rayleigh criterion provides a limit on the ability to distinguish two closely spaced point objects. For a circular aperture, two point sources are considered just resolved when the center of the diffraction pattern (Airy disk) of one source is directly over the first minimum of the diffraction pattern of the other. The angular separation for this condition is given by:\n$$ \\theta_{min} = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D} $$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of light in the medium and $D$ is the diameter of the circular aperture (pupil).\n\nThe lateral resolution, $\\Delta x$, is the minimum resolvable separation distance in the focal plane. For an objective with focal length $f$, this distance is:\n$$ \\Delta x = f \\tan(\\theta_{min}) $$\nUnder the paraxial approximation, $\\tan(\\theta_{min}) \\approx \\theta_{min}$, so:\n$$ \\Delta x \\approx f \\theta_{min} = f \\left(1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}\\right) = 1.22 \\lambda \\left(\\frac{f}{D}\\right) $$\nThe numerical aperture ($NA$) of an objective is defined as $NA = n \\sin(\\theta)$, where $n$ is the refractive index of the medium and $\\theta$ is the half-angle of the cone of light accepted by the lens. In our case, the objective operates in air, so $n \\approx 1$. The problem specifies using the small-angle approximation, so $NA = \\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\tan(\\theta)$. From the geometry of the focusing cone, $\\tan(\\theta)$ is the ratio of the aperture radius ($D/2$) to the focal length ($f$):\n$$ NA \\approx \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{D/2}{f} = \\frac{D}{2f} $$\nRearranging this gives the f-number, $\\frac{f}{D} = \\frac{1}{2 NA}$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $\\frac{f}{D}$ into the equation for $\\Delta x$:\n$$ \\Delta x = 1.22 \\lambda \\left(\\frac{1}{2 NA}\\right) = \\frac{0.61 \\lambda}{NA} $$\nThis is the derived expression for the lateral resolution based on the Rayleigh criterion.\n\n**2. Confocal Parameter ($b$)**\n\nThe confocal parameter must be derived using the Gaussian beam model. The confocal parameter, $b$, is defined as twice the Rayleigh range, $b = 2z_R$. The Rayleigh range, $z_R$, is the distance along the propagation axis from the beam waist to the point where the beam radius has increased by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$. The formula for the Rayleigh range is:\n$$ z_R = \\frac{\\pi w_0^2}{\\lambda} $$\nwhere $w_0$ is the beam radius at the waist (focus) and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength in the medium.\n\nTo relate this to $NA$, we use the expression for the far-field divergence half-angle $\\theta_{div}$ of a Gaussian beam:\n$$ \\theta_{div} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi w_0} $$\nFor a focused beam, this divergence angle corresponds to the half-angle of the focusing cone, $\\theta$. Thus, $\\theta_{div} = \\theta$. Using the small-angle approximation for the numerical aperture, $NA = n \\sin(\\theta) \\approx n \\theta$. Since $n=1$ for air, we have $NA \\approx \\theta$.\nTherefore, we can write:\n$$ NA \\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi w_0} $$\nFrom this, we solve for the beam waist radius $w_0$:\n$$ w_0 \\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi NA} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $w_0$ into the formula for the Rayleigh range $z_R$:\n$$ z_R = \\frac{\\pi}{\\lambda} \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi NA}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi}{\\lambda} \\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\pi^2 NA^2} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi NA^2} $$\nThe confocal parameter is $b = 2z_R$. Thus, the final expression is:\n$$ b = \\frac{2 \\lambda}{\\pi NA^2} $$\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe given values are $\\lambda = 1300 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 1.3 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$ and $NA = 0.05$.\n\n- **Lateral Resolution**:\n$$ \\Delta x = \\frac{0.61 \\lambda}{NA} = \\frac{0.61 \\times (1.3 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu m})}{0.05} = \\frac{0.793 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}}{0.05} = 15.86 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu m} $$\n\n- **Confocal Parameter**:\n$$ b = \\frac{2 \\lambda}{\\pi NA^2} = \\frac{2 \\times 1.3 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}}{\\pi \\times (0.05)^2} = \\frac{2.6 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}}{\\pi \\times 0.0025} = \\frac{2.6 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}}{0.00785398...} \\approx 331.042 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu m} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the confocal parameter is $331.0 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$.\n\n**4. Conceptual Explanation of Trade-off**\n\nThe derived expressions show the fundamental trade-off between lateral resolution and depth of focus in an imaging system:\n$$ \\Delta x \\propto \\frac{1}{NA} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b \\propto \\frac{1}{NA^2} $$\nAn increase in the numerical aperture ($NA$) results in a smaller focal spot size, thereby improving the lateral resolution ($\\Delta x$ decreases). However, this improvement comes at the cost of a quadratically decreasing confocal parameter ($b$), which represents the depth of focus. In physical terms, a high $NA$ corresponds to focusing light with a steeply angled cone, which converges to a very tight spot but diverges rapidly away from the focal plane. This yields high lateral resolution over a very shallow depth.\n\nConversely, a low $NA$ corresponds to a gently angled focusing cone, resulting in a larger focal spot (poorer lateral resolution) but a beam that remains collimated over a longer axial distance (greater depth of focus).\n\nWhen imaging thick structures, such as dental enamel which can be several millimetres thick, this trade-off is critical.\n- To achieve very high lateral resolution to visualize fine microstructural changes (e.g., initial caries lesions), a high $NA$ is required. This, however, provides a very shallow depth of focus (potentially only a few micrometres). To image the entire thickness of the enamel, the system must perform a \"z-stack\" acquisition, where multiple images are captured at different focal depths and computationally combined, which is the standard mode of operation for OCT.\n- For a survey scan or when imaging larger-scale features where ultra-high resolution is not the priority, a lower $NA$ (such as the $NA=0.05$ given in the problem) can be advantageous. The resulting larger depth of focus (here, $b \\approx 331 \\ \\mu m$) allows a significant portion of the tissue thickness to be in acceptable focus within a single axial scan line, simplifying the imaging process and potentially increasing acquisition speed. Even so, for a sample of a few millimetres, several focal shifts would still be necessary. The choice of $NA$ is therefore a strategic compromise based on the specific diagnostic or research goal: prioritizing lateral resolution for detailed analysis of a thin layer, or prioritizing depth of focus for rapid volumetric surveying of a thick structure.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 15.86 & 331.0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4691159"}, {"introduction": "A high-resolution image is only the beginning of scientific inquiry; for quantitative research, we must translate image pixel intensities into meaningful physical measurements.
