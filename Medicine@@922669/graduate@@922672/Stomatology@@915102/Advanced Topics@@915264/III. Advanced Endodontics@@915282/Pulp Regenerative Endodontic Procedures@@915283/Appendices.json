A solution will be developed as instructed.\n\n***\n\n### Solution Development\n\nThe problem requires a three-part derivation followed by a final calculation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the RCF Expression**\n\nWe are asked to derive an expression for the Relative Centrifugal Force, $\\text{RCF}$, in terms of rotor radius $r_{\\text{cm}}$ in centimeters and rotational speed $N$ in revolutions per minute ($\\text{rpm}$).\n\nThe angular velocity $\\omega$ in radians per second ($\\text{rad/s}$) is related to the rotational speed $N$ in $\\text{rpm}$ by:\n$$ \\omega \\, (\\text{rad/s}) = N \\, (\\text{rpm}) \\times \\frac{2\\pi \\, \\text{rad}}{1 \\, \\text{rev}} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{min}}{60 \\, \\text{s}} = \\frac{2\\pi N}{60} $$\nThe centripetal acceleration $a$ is given by $a = \\omega^2 r$. Substituting the expression for $\\omega$:\n$$ a = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi N}{60}\\right)^2 r = \\frac{4\\pi^2 N^2}{3600} r $$\nHere, $r$ must be in SI units (meters) for $a$ to be in $\\text{m/s}^2$. The problem specifies using the radius in centimeters, denoted $r_{\\text{cm}}$. The conversion is $r \\, (\\text{m}) = r_{\\text{cm}} \\times 10^{-2}$.\n$$ a = \\frac{4\\pi^2 N^2}{3600} (r_{\\text{cm}} \\times 10^{-2}) $$\nThe RCF is defined as the ratio of the centripetal acceleration to the standard gravitational acceleration, $g$:\n$$ \\text{RCF} = \\frac{a}{g} = \\frac{1}{g} \\left[ \\frac{4\\pi^2 N^2}{3600} (r_{\\text{cm}} \\times 10^{-2}) \\right] $$\nRearranging the terms to match the desired form, $C \\times r_{\\text{cm}} \\times (\\text{rpm})^2$:\n$$ \\text{RCF} = \\left( \\frac{4\\pi^2}{360000 g} \\right) r_{\\text{cm}} N^2 $$\nThe constant factor is $C = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{360000 g}$. Using the standard value for $g \\approx 9.80665 \\ \\text{m/s}^2$:\n$$ C = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{360000 \\times 9.80665} \\approx \\frac{39.4784176}{3530394} \\approx 1.11824 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nThus, the expression is $\\text{RCF} \\approx (1.118 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times r_{\\text{cm}} \\times N^2$.\n\n**Part 2: Platelet Yield Fraction Scaling**\n\nWe are asked to show that for the unsaturated regime, the platelet yield fraction $Y$ is linearly proportional to the product of $\\text{RCF}$ and time $t$.\n\nPlatelets are assumed to be initially uniformly distributed along a vertical column of fluid of height $H$. The terminal settling velocity $v$ of a platelet under centrifugation is given by Stokes' law:\n$$ v = \\frac{2}{9} \\frac{\\Delta \\rho \\, a_{p}^{2}}{\\mu} \\, g_{\\text{eff}} $$\nwhere $g_{\\text{eff}} = \\text{RCF} \\cdot g$ is the effective acceleration. Substituting for $g_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$ v = \\frac{2}{9} \\frac{\\Delta \\rho \\, a_{p}^{2}}{\\mu} (\\text{RCF} \\cdot g) $$\nThe total distance a platelet settles in time $t$ is $d = v \\cdot t$. The yield fraction $Y$ is the ratio of the volume of fluid cleared of platelets to the total fluid volume. For a tube of uniform cross-section, this is the ratio of the cleared height to the total height:\n$$ Y = \\frac{d}{H} = \\frac{v \\cdot t}{H} $$\nThis model is valid for the unsaturated regime, where $v \\cdot t \\leq H$. Substituting the expression for $v$:\n$$ Y = \\frac{t}{H} \\left( \\frac{2}{9} \\frac{\\Delta \\rho \\, a_{p}^{2}}{\\mu} (\\text{RCF} \\cdot g) \\right) $$\nRearranging the terms gives the form requested in the problem statement:\n$$ Y = \\left(\\frac{2}{9} \\frac{\\Delta \\rho \\, a_{p}^{2} g}{\\mu H}\\right) \\, (\\text{RCF} \\cdot t) $$\nThe term in the large parentheses is a constant, let's call it $K$, for a given specimen (constant $\\Delta \\rho$, $a_p$, $\\mu$) and tube geometry (constant $H$).\n$$ K = \\frac{2 \\Delta \\rho \\, a_{p}^{2} g}{9 \\mu H} $$\nThus, the yield is $Y = K \\cdot \\text{RCF} \\cdot t$, which confirms the linear scaling with the product $\\text{RCF} \\cdot t$.\n\n**Part 3: Condition for Equal Yield**\n\nFor two procedures (A and B) using identical tubes, fluids, and processing time $t$, the condition for equal platelet yield, $Y_A = Y_B$, can be established.\n$$ Y_A = K \\cdot \\text{RCF}_A \\cdot t $$\n$$ Y_B = K \\cdot \\text{RCF}_B \\cdot t $$\nSetting $Y_A = Y_B$:\n$$ K \\cdot \\text{RCF}_A \\cdot t = K \\cdot \\text{RCF}_B \\cdot t $$\nSince $K > 0$ and $t > 0$, we can divide by $K \\cdot t$ to obtain:\n$$ \\text{RCF}_A = \\text{RCF}_B $$\nFrom Part 1, we know that $\\text{RCF} = C \\cdot r \\cdot N^2$, where $C$ is a universal constant.\n$$ C \\cdot r_1 \\cdot N_1^2 = C \\cdot r_2 \\cdot N_2^2 $$\nDividing by the constant $C$ gives the condition for equal yield:\n$$ r_1 N_1^2 = r_2 N_2^2 $$\nThis demonstrates that for identical processing times, equal platelet yield is achieved when the product of the rotor radius and the square of the rotational speed is conserved. The units of radius do not matter as long as they are consistent on both sides of the equation.\n\n**Part 4: Calculation of Rotational Speed for Centrifuge B**\n\nWe are given the parameters for Centrifuge A and the radius for Centrifuge B, and we must find the rotational speed $N_2$ for Centrifuge B that produces the same yield.\n- Centrifuge A: $r_1 = 8.0 \\ \\text{cm}$, $N_1 = 3000 \\ \\text{rpm}$\n- Centrifuge B: $r_2 = 5.0 \\ \\text{cm}$, $N_2 = ?$\n\nUsing the relationship derived in Part 3:\n$$ r_1 N_1^2 = r_2 N_2^2 $$\nWe solve for $N_2$:\n$$ N_2^2 = \\frac{r_1}{r_2} N_1^2 $$\n$$ N_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_1}{r_2}} N_1 $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ N_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{8.0 \\ \\text{cm}}{5.0 \\ \\text{cm}}} \\times 3000 \\ \\text{rpm} $$\n$$ N_2 = \\sqrt{1.6} \\times 3000 \\ \\text{rpm} $$\n$$ N_2 \\approx 1.264911064 \\times 3000 \\ \\text{rpm} $$\n$$ N_2 \\approx 3794.733192 \\ \\text{rpm} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ N_2 = 3795 \\ \\text{rpm} $$\nThe additional parameters ($\\mu, a_p, \\Delta \\rho, H$) were necessary to validate the physical model and the unsaturated regime assumption, but are not required for the final calculation, which depends only on the scaling law.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3795}\n$$", "id": "4763123"}, {"introduction": "The success of a regenerative procedure depends on communication at the molecular level, where growth factors must travel through a scaffold to signal stem cells.

The negative sign indicates that diffusion occurs from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, i.e., down the concentration gradient.\n\nThe problem states that the concentration profile is linear and at steady state. A linear profile for a concentration $C(x)$ between $x=0$ and $x=L$ means that the gradient $\\frac{dC}{dx}$ is constant.

The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe fundamental principle governing this problem is that for any single radiographic acquisition, the ratio of an object's true physical length to its measured radiographic length (in pixels) is a constant for all objects located in the same geometric plane. This constant is a function of the imaging system's magnification and the detector's pixel pitch. Let $L_{true}$ denote the true length of an object and $L_{px}$ its corresponding length in pixels on the radiograph. For a given image, the relationship is:\n$$ \\frac{L_{true}}{L_{px}} = C $$\nwhere $C$ is the calibration factor for that image, with units of length per pixel (e.g., mm/pixel). This factor is constant within one image but may differ between images if the imaging geometry (source-to-object or object-to-detector distance) changes.\n\nThe problem provides a reference object of known true length, $L_{ref,true}$, allowing us to determine the calibration factor for each acquisition.\n\n**1. Baseline Measurement Analysis**\nLet $L_{root,base,true}$ be the true root length at baseline. The problem states that the reference strip and the tooth are co-planar, so they share the same calibration factor. We establish a proportionality:\n$$ \\frac{L_{root,base,true}}{L_{root,base,px}} = \\frac{L_{ref,true}}{L_{ref,base,px}} $$\nWe are given $L_{ref,true} = 10.00\\,\\text{mm}$, $L_{ref,base,px} = 400\\,\\text{pixels}$, and $L_{root,base,px} = 520\\,\\text{pixels}$. We can solve for the true root length at baseline:\n$$ L_{root,base,true} = L_{ref,true} \\times \\frac{L_{root,base,px}}{L_{ref,base,px}} $$\n$$ L_{root,base,true} = 10.00\\,\\text{mm} \\times \\frac{520}{400} = 10.00 \\times 1.30 = 13.00\\,\\text{mm} $$\n\n**2.

The radiographic length of the reference strip has changed to $L_{ref,fu,px} = 360\\,\\text{pixels}$, indicating a change in magnification. We must use the new data to calibrate this second image. The new proportionality is:\n$$ \\frac{L_{root,fu,true}}{L_{root,fu,px}} = \\frac{L_{ref,true}}{L_{ref,fu,px}} $$\nWe are given $L_{ref,true} = 10.00\\,\\text{mm}$, $L_{ref,fu,px} = 360\\,\\text{pixels}$, and $L_{root,fu,px} = 600\\,\\text{pixels}$. We solve for the true root length at follow-up:\n$$ L_{root,fu,true} = L_{ref,true} \\times \\frac{L_{root,fu,px}}{L_{ref,fu,px}} $$\n$$ L_{root,fu,true} = 10.00\\,\\text{mm} \\times \\frac{600}{360} = 10.00 \\times \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{50.00}{3}\\,\\text{mm} $$\nThis value is approximately $16.66\\overline{6}\\,\\text{mm}$.\n\n**3. Computation of the Growth Metric $R$**\nThe problem defines the dimensionless growth metric $R$ as the relative increase in true root length:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\text{change in true length}}{\\text{original true length}} = \\frac{L_{root,fu,true} - L_{root,base,true}}{L_{root,base,true}} $$\nSubstituting the computed true lengths:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\frac{50.00}{3}\\,\\text{mm} - 13.00\\,\\text{mm}}{13.00\\,\\text{mm}} $$\nTo perform the subtraction, we find a common denominator:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\frac{50.00}{3} - \\frac{3 \\times 13.00}{3}}{13.00} = \\frac{\\frac{50.00 - 39.00}{3}}{13.00} = \\frac{\\frac{11.00}{3}}{13.00} $$\n$$ R = \\frac{11.00}{3 \\times 13.00} = \\frac{11}{39} $$\nNow, we compute the decimal value of this fraction:\n$$ R = \\frac{11}{39} \\approx 0.28205128... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2$, $8$, $2$, and $0$. The fifth digit is $5$, which requires rounding up the fourth significant digit.\n$$ R \\approx 0.2821 $$\nThis represents a true root length increase of approximately $28.21\\%$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.2821}\n$$", "id": "4763090"}]}
