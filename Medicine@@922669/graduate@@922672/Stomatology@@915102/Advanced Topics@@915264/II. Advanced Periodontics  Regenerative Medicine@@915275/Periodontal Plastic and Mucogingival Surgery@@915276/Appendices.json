Cairo's RT classification is a standard, published system for prognosticating root coverage outcomes. The problem is scientifically grounded within its specific domain.\n- **Well-Posed**: All necessary information is provided. The values for buccal recession and interproximal CAL are given, as are the classification rules, the scoring system, and the predictive formula. The steps to follow are clearly delineated. A unique solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise clinical terminology and quantitative data. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n- **Verdict**: The problem is valid. It is a well-defined, self-contained problem based on established clinical science.\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Problem\nThe solution proceeds in a sequence of four steps as directed by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we determine the Recession Type (RT) class for the tooth.\nWe are given:\n- Buccal recession depth, $R_{buccal} = 3\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n- The worst-case interproximal clinical attachment level, $CAL_{interproximal} = 2\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nWe apply the provided RT classification definitions:\n- To be RT$1$, the interproximal CAL must be $0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. Here, $CAL_{interproximal} = 2\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, so the class is not RT$1$.\n- For RT$2$ and RT$3$, there must be interproximal attachment loss, meaning $CAL_{interproximal} > 0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. This condition is met since $2 > 0$.\n- To distinguish between RT$2$ and RT$3$, we compare the interproximal CAL to the buccal recession depth.\n$$CAL_{interproximal} = 2\\ \\text{mm}$$\n$$R_{buccal} = 3\\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe comparison is $2\\ \\mathrm{mm} \\le 3\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n- The definition of RT$2$ is that interproximal attachment loss is present and is less than or equal to the buccal recession depth. Since $CAL_{interproximal} \\le R_{buccal}$, the condition for RT$2$ is met.\n- The definition of RT$3$ is that interproximal attachment loss is present and is greater than the buccal recession depth. This condition is not met, as $2$ is not greater than $3$.\nTherefore, the tooth is classified as RT$2$.\n\nSecond, we assign an ordinal score to the determined RT class.\nThe problem provides the mapping: RT$1 \\mapsto 1$, RT$2 \\mapsto 2$, and RT$3 \\mapsto 3$.\nSince the class is RT$2$, the corresponding RT score is $2$.\n\nThird, we use the predictive model to calculate the expected mean root coverage, $E(\\%)$.\nThe model is given by:\n$$E(\\%) = 85 - 10 \\cdot (\\text{RT score})$$\nSubstituting the RT score of $2$ into the equation:\n$$E(\\%) = 85 - 10 \\cdot (2)$$\n$$E(\\%) = 85 - 20$$\n$$E(\\%) = 65$$\nThis means the expected mean root coverage is $65\\%$.\n\nFinally, we express this result as a unitless decimal fraction.\nTo convert a percentage to a decimal fraction (a proportion), we divide by $100$.\n$$\\text{Proportion} = \\frac{E(\\%)}{100} = \\frac{65}{100} = 0.65$$\nThe final answer is the unitless decimal fraction.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.65}\n$$", "id": "4750169"}, {"introduction": "Following diagnosis and prognosis, meticulous surgical planning is paramount to achieving the desired clinical outcome.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to determine the initial dimensions of the Free Gingival Graft (FGG), specifically its initial length, $L_i$, and initial width, $W_i$.\n\nFirst, we must establish the required final dimensions of the healed graft, $L_f$ and $W_f$, that will satisfy the clinical goals.\n\nThe problem states that the augmentation is required over a clinical span of $12\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. This represents the final, healed length that the graft must cover. Therefore, the required final length is:\n$$L_f = 12\\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nNext, we determine the required final width of the healed graft. The goal is to achieve a total keratinized tissue width of $3\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. The patient already has an existing width of $1\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, which is assumed to remain stable. The FGG must therefore provide the additional width needed to reach the target after healing. The required width contribution from the healed graft, $W_f$, is the difference between the target width and the existing width:\n$$W_f = (\\text{Target width}) - (\\text{Existing width})$$\n$$W_f = 3\\ \\mathrm{mm} - 1\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 2\\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nNow we use the provided shrinkage model to calculate the necessary initial dimensions, $L_i$ and $W_i$. The model relates final dimensions to initial dimensions via the shrinkage fraction $s = 0.20$:\n$$L_f = (1 - s) L_i$$\n$$W_f = (1 - s) W_i$$\n\nTo find the initial dimensions, we rearrange these equations:\n$$L_i = \\frac{L_f}{1 - s}$$\n$$W_i = \\frac{W_f}{1 - s}$$\n\nThe value of the shrinkage factor is $(1 - s)$:\n$$1 - s = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$$\n\nNow, we substitute the values for $L_f$, $W_f$, and $(1 - s)$ to find $L_i$ and $W_i$.\n\nFor the initial length, $L_i$:\n$$L_i = \\frac{12\\ \\mathrm{mm}}{0.80} = 15\\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nFor the initial width, $W_i$:\n$$W_i = \\frac{2\\ \\mathrm{mm}}{0.80} = 2.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in millimeters and rounded to four significant figures.\nThe calculated initial length is $15\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. To four significant figures, this is $15.00\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\nThe calculated initial width is $2.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. To four significant figures, this is $2.500\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nTherefore, to achieve the desired clinical outcome under the specified shrinkage model, the graft must be harvested with an initial length of $15.00\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and an initial width of $2.500\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 15.00 & 2.500 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4750184"}, {"introduction": "The clinical cycle concludes with a rigorous assessment of surgical outcomes.
