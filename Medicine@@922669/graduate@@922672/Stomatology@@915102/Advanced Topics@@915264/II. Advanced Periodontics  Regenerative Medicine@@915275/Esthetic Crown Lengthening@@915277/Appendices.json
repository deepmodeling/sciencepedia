For a single maxillary central incisor, you measure the clinical mesiodistal width as $8.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and the current clinical crown height (incisal edge to free gingival margin) as $9.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. The esthetic target is a width-to-height ratio of $0.78$, consistent with commonly observed anterior esthetic proportions. Assume the clinical crown height is altered only by apical or coronal repositioning of the free gingival margin via esthetic crown lengthening, with the incisal edge position kept fixed. Also assume that surgical planning must respect the supracrestal tissue attachment (STA), defined as the combined junctional epithelium and connective tissue attachment, such that the alveolar crest remains apical to the planned free gingival margin by a biologically typical distance.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition that the width-to-height ratio $r$ is the quotient of clinical width $w$ over clinical height $h$ for the visible crown ($r = w/h$), derive the target clinical crown height that satisfies the desired ratio for the given measured width, and then determine the signed vertical displacement $\\Delta$ of the free gingival margin required to achieve this target height.

While it mentions the STA, it correctly does not require its numerical value for the geometric calculation of gingival margin displacement, which is the sole focus of the question. The setup is internally consistent.\n5.  **Realism and Feasibility**: The scenario is a realistic representation of a common clinical calculation in esthetic dental treatment planning. The values are physically plausible.\n6.  **Structure and Logic**: The problem is logically structured and free from ambiguity or circular reasoning.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique, meaningful solution. A detailed derivation will now follow.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the necessary vertical displacement, $\\Delta$, of the free gingival margin to change the clinical crown height of a maxillary central incisor from its initial value, $h_{\\text{initial}}$, to a target value, $h_{\\text{target}}$, that satisfies a specific esthetic proportion.\n\nThe fundamental relationship provided is the width-to-height ratio, $r$, defined as:\n$$r = \\frac{w}{h}$$\nwhere $w$ is the mesiodistal width and $h$ is the clinical crown height.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Constant width: $w = 8.5 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n- Initial height: $h_{\\text{initial}} = 9.0 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n- Target ratio: $r_{\\text{target}} = 0.78$\n\nThe target clinical crown height, $h_{\\text{target}}$, is the height that will satisfy the target ratio, $r_{\\text{target}}$, for the given width, $w$. This can be calculated by rearranging the fundamental definition:\n$$r_{\\text{target}} = \\frac{w}{h_{\\text{target}}}$$\nSolving for $h_{\\text{target}}$ yields:\n$$h_{\\text{target}} = \\frac{w}{r_{\\text{target}}}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$h_{\\text{target}} = \\frac{8.5}{0.78} \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$h_{\\text{target}} \\approx 10.897435... \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThe problem defines the signed vertical displacement, $\\Delta$, as the change required to move the free gingival margin from its initial position to its target position. The incisal edge is a fixed reference point. The clinical crown height is the distance between the incisal edge and the free gingival margin.\n\nAn increase in clinical crown height (i.e., $h_{\\text{target}} > h_{\\text{initial}}$) requires the free gingival margin to move apically (away from the incisal edge, toward the root). The problem's sign convention states that such an apical repositioning corresponds to a positive displacement, $\\Delta > 0$. Therefore, the displacement $\\Delta$ can be directly calculated as the difference between the target height and the initial height:\n$$\\Delta = h_{\\text{target}} - h_{\\text{initial}}$$\n\nSubstituting the values for $h_{\\text{target}}$ and $h_{\\text{initial}}$:\n$$\\Delta = \\left( \\frac{8.5}{0.78} - 9.0 \\right) \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$\\Delta \\approx (10.897435... - 9.0) \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$\\Delta \\approx 1.897435... \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThe positive sign of $\\Delta$ correctly indicates that an apical repositioning of the gingival margin is required, which constitutes an esthetic crown lengthening procedure. This is consistent with the initial conditions, where the initial ratio $r_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{8.5}{9.0} \\approx 0.944$ is greater than the target ratio $r_{\\text{target}} = 0.78$. To decrease the ratio $w/h$ with a fixed $w$, the denominator $h$ must be increased.\n\nThe final step is to round the result for $\\Delta$ to three significant figures.\nThe calculated value is $\\Delta \\approx 1.897435...$.\nThe first three significant figures are $1$, $8$, and $9$. The fourth digit is $7$, which is $5$ or greater, so we round up the third significant figure ($9$) to $0$, carrying over to the previous digit. This results in $1.90$.\n\nTherefore, the required signed vertical displacement of the free gingival margin is $1.90 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.90}$$", "id": "4716835"}, {"introduction": "Once an esthetic target is set, the clinician must make a critical biological assessment to determine the appropriate surgical pathway.

The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is clinical and precise. It uses standard terminology (supracrestal tissue attachment, free gingival margin, alveolar crest). The problem relies on quantitative relationships and established biological principles, not on subjective opinion. The problem is objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, with no internal contradictions or missing information. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires a quantitative analysis of the spatial relationships between the free gingival margin (FGM), the base of the gingival sulcus, the supracrestal tissue attachment (STA), and the alveolar crest (AC). Let us define a vertical coordinate system where the initial FGM is at $z = 0$. Apical positions are negative.\n\n**1. Initial State Analysis**\n-   Initial FGM position: $z_{\\text{FGM}} = 0\\ \\text{mm}$.\n-   Initial AC position: $z_{\\text{AC}} = -3.5\\ \\text{mm}$.\n-   The total distance from the alveolar crest to the gingival margin is $D_{\\text{AC-FGM}} = z_{\\text{FGM}} - z_{\\text{AC}} = 0 - (-3.5\\ \\text{mm}) = 3.5\\ \\text{mm}$.\n-   This total distance is composed of the STA and the gingival sulcus depth (SD).\n-   Given STA $= 3.0\\ \\text{mm}$.\n-   Therefore, the initial sulcus depth is $SD_{\\text{initial}} = D_{\\text{AC-FGM}} - \\text{STA} = 3.5\\ \\text{mm} - 3.0\\ \\text{mm} = 0.5\\ \\text{mm}$. The base of the initial sulcus is at $z_{\\text{sulcus base}} = -0.5\\ \\text{mm}$.\n\n**2. Target State Definition**\n-   The FGM is to be moved apically by $1.5\\ \\text{mm}$.\n-   New FGM position: $z'_{\\text{FGM}} = 0\\ \\text{mm} - 1.5\\ \\text{mm} = -1.5\\ \\text{mm}$.\n-   The biological requirements for the new, stable state are:\n    -   STA $= 3.0\\ \\text{mm}$ (must be preserved).\n    -   Target sulcus depth: $SD' = 1.0\\ \\text{mm}$.\n-   Therefore, the required total distance from the new alveolar crest ($AC'$) to the new FGM ($FGM'$) must be the sum of the STA and the desired sulcus depth.\n-   Required crest-to-margin distance: $D'_{\\text{AC'-FGM'}} = \\text{STA} + SD' = 3.0\\ \\text{mm} + 1.0\\ \\text{mm} = 4.0\\ \\text{mm}$.\n\n**3. Evaluation of a Soft Tissue–Only Approach (Gingivectomy)**\n-   This procedure would reposition the FGM to $z'_{\\text{FGM}} = -1.5\\ \\text{mm}$, but leave the alveolar crest in its initial position at $z_{\\text{AC}} = -3.5\\ \\text{mm}$.\n-   The resulting distance between the crest and the new margin would be: $D_{\\text{AC-FGM'}} = z'_{\\text{FGM}} - z_{\\text{AC}} = (-1.5\\ \\text{mm}) - (-3.5\\ \\text{mm}) = 2.0\\ \\text{mm}$.\n-   This available supracrestal space of $2.0\\ \\text{mm}$ is insufficient to accommodate the patient's required STA of $3.0\\ \\text{mm}$, let alone the STA plus a $1.0\\ \\text{mm}$ sulcus (which requires $4.0\\ \\text{mm}$).\n-   This constitutes a violation of the supracrestal tissue attachment. Such a violation predictably leads to chronic inflammation and either gingival rebound (tissue growing back coronally) or loss of alveolar bone, defeating the esthetic and health objectives.\n-   Conclusion: A soft tissue–only approach is insufficient and biologically contraindicated.\n\n**4. Calculation of Required Osseous Modification**\n-   To achieve a stable outcome, the alveolar crest must be repositioned apically to provide the required $4.0\\ \\text{mm}$ distance for the STA and sulcus.\n-   The target FGM is at $z'_{\\text{FGM}} = -1.5\\ \\text{mm}$.\n-   The new alveolar crest ($AC'$) must be $4.0\\ \\text{mm}$ apical to this new margin.\n-   Target AC position: $z'_{\\text{AC}} = z'_{\\text{FGM}} - 4.0\\ \\text{mm} = -1.5\\ \\text{mm} - 4.0\\ \\text{mm} = -5.5\\ \\text{mm}$.\n-   The initial AC position was $z_{\\text{AC}} = -3.5\\ \\text{mm}$.\n-   The amount of osseous recontouring (bone removal) required is the difference between the target and initial crest positions:\n-   Bone Removal $= |z'_{\\text{AC}}| - |z_{\\text{AC}}| = |-5.5\\ \\text{mm}| - |-3.5\\ \\text{mm}| = 5.5\\ \\text{mm} - 3.5\\ \\text{mm} = 2.0\\ \\text{mm}$.\n-   Therefore, $2.0\\ \\text{mm}$ of alveolar bone must be removed in addition to the soft tissue resection to achieve the desired esthetic and biologic outcome.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Soft tissue–only resection is sufficient; after removing $1.5\\ \\text{mm}$ of gingiva, the new crest-to-margin distance of $2.0\\ \\text{mm}$ approximates a normal supracrestal tissue attachment, so stability is expected.**\n- The calculation that the new crest-to-margin distance is $2.0\\ \\text{mm}$ is correct. However, the problem explicitly states this patient's STA is $3.0\\ \\text{mm}$. A space of $2.0\\ \\text{mm}$ is biologically insufficient for a $3.0\\ \\text{mm}$ attachment, leading to instability, not stability.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Soft tissue–only resection is insufficient because it exceeds the sulcus depth by $1.0\\ \\text{mm}$; osseous recontouring of at least $1.0\\ \\text{mm}$ will re-establish the supracrestal tissue attachment and is therefore adequate to meet the stated goals.**\n- The first clause, \"Soft tissue–only resection is insufficient,\" is correct. The reasoning provided is awkwardly phrased but alludes to the invasion of the attached gingiva.\n- The proposed solution, removing $1.0\\ \\text{mm}$ of bone, would create a new crest-to-margin distance of $(-1.5\\ \\text{mm}) - (-3.5\\ \\text{mm} - 1.0\\ \\text{mm}) = 3.0\\ \\text{mm}$. This space must house the STA ($3.0\\ \\text{mm}$) and the sulcus ($1.0\\ \\text{mm}$), requiring a total of $4.0\\ \\text{mm}$. A $3.0\\ \\text{mm}$ space is inadequate as it leaves no room for a sulcus.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Soft tissue–only resection is insufficient; however, an apically positioned flap without osseous recontouring is adequate because the junctional epithelium can lengthen by $1.5\\ \\text{mm}$ to compensate without biologic cost.**\n- \"Soft tissue–only resection is insufficient\" is correct.\n- An apically positioned flap without osseous surgery results in the same final crest-to-margin distance of $2.0\\ \\text{mm}$, which is biologically inadequate.\n- The claim that the junctional epithelium can lengthen by such a large amount to compensate \"without biologic cost\" is contrary to established periodontal principles. The STA is a stable biological dimension, and attempting to force its alteration leads to pathological responses.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Soft tissue–only resection is insufficient; to preserve a $3.0\\ \\text{mm}$ supracrestal tissue attachment and create an approximately $1.0\\ \\text{mm}$ sulcus after a $1.5\\ \\text{mm}$ margin shift, osseous recontouring must apically reposition the alveolar crest so that the post-operative crest-to-margin distance is about $4.0\\ \\text{mm}$, which requires roughly $2.0\\ \\text{mm}$ of bone removal in this case.**\n- This option correctly identifies that a soft tissue–only approach is insufficient.\n- It correctly calculates the required postoperative crest-to-margin distance by summing the required STA ($3.0\\ \\text{mm}$) and target sulcus depth ($1.0\\ \\text{mm}$), yielding $4.0\\ \\text{mm}$.\n- It correctly deduces the necessary amount of bone removal ($2.0\\ \\text{mm}$) to establish this $4.0\\ \\text{mm}$ dimension, given the planned $1.5\\ \\text{mm}$ apical shift of the gingival margin. The calculation is precise: initial crest at $-3.5\\ \\text{mm}$; final margin at $-1.5\\ \\text{mm}$; final crest must be at $-1.5 - 4.0 = -5.5\\ \\text{mm}$; bone removal is $-3.5 - (-5.5) = 2.0\\ \\text{mm}$.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "4716864"}, {"introduction": "A truly esthetic outcome considers the entire gingival frame, not just the facial aspect of a single tooth.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and based on objective clinical data and principles. A solution can be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by evaluating the impact of the proposed surgical plan on the critical anatomical dimensions.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Interproximal Dimension and Papilla Risk:**\n- The initial distance from the interproximal contact point to the alveolar bone crest is given as $4.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- The research by Tarnow et al. demonstrated that when this distance is $\\le 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, the interproximal papilla fills the embrasure space completely in nearly $100\\%$ of cases. At the initial state of $4.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, the papilla is expected to be full and esthetically pleasing.\n- The proposed surgical plan includes a uniform ostectomy of $1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This means the interproximal alveolar crest will be moved apically by $1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- The new, post-surgical distance from the contact point to the bone crest will be the sum of the initial distance and the amount of bone reduction:\n$$ \\text{New Distance} = 4.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} + 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 5.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\n- According to Tarnow's findings, as this distance increases beyond $5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, the probability of complete papilla fill decreases dramatically. At $6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, the probability is only about $56\\%$. A distance of $5.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ lies between these two data points, representing a significant and unacceptable risk of incomplete papilla fill, which would result in an esthetic failure known as a \"black triangle.\" This is especially critical for a patient with a high smile line where the interproximal area is highly visible.\n- Therefore, the preliminary surgical plan poses a significant risk to the papilla height.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Facial Dimension and Restorative Goal:**\n- The restorative goal is to gain $1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ of clinical crown height.\n- To achieve this while maintaining periodontal health, a stable supracrestal tissue attachment must be re-established. The problem specifies a guideline of at least $3.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ from the future restorative margin to the alveolar crest.\n- The plan to perform a $1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ ostectomy on the facial aspect is appropriate. By lowering the bone by $1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, the gingival tissue will heal at a more apical position, exposing the desired $1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ of additional tooth structure. The new restorative margin can then be placed at this new gingival margin, which will be approximately $3.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ coronal to the new bone level, satisfying the biological requirement.\n\n**3. Synthesis and Proposed Modification:**\n- The facial ostectomy is necessary and appropriate, but the interproximal ostectomy is problematic. A uniform reduction of bone is therefore contraindicated.\n- The most appropriate modification is to alter the surgical plan to preserve the interproximal bone height. The surgeon should perform a scalloped ostectomy, removing bone primarily on the facial aspect and preserving the peak of bone in the interproximal region.\n- If some minor interproximal bone recontouring is unavoidable for a smooth transition, and the final contact-to-crest distance is predicted to be slightly over $5.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ (e.g., $5.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), a restorative solution can be employed. By lengthening the proximal contact area of the new crowns or veneers apically, the contact point itself is moved closer to the bone crest. For a final distance of $5.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, moving the contact point apically by $0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ would restore the critical distance to a safe $5.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The planned interproximal ostectomy would increase the contact–to–crest distance to $5.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, exceeding Tarnow’s threshold associated with near-certain papilla presence and increasing the risk of a black triangle; modify the plan to avoid or minimize interproximal ostectomy (maintain a scalloped, interproximal bone peak) and, if needed, apically extend the proximal contact by about $0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ via restorative contouring to keep the contact–to–crest distance at or below the threshold.**\n- This option correctly calculates the new distance as $5.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. It accurately assesses the risk based on Tarnow's principle. The proposed solution—a scalloped ostectomy to preserve interproximal bone combined with potential restorative lengthening of the contact—is the gold standard, state-of-the-art approach for this clinical scenario. It addresses both the biological constraints and the esthetic goals.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. There is no meaningful papilla risk because $5.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ remains below the level at which papilla loss is observed; proceed with the uniform ostectomy and, if any concern remains, increase interproximal ostectomy to create more biologic width.**\n- This statement is factually incorrect. A distance of $5.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ carries a very meaningful risk of papilla non-fill, which is a form of papilla loss. The recommendation to proceed with the flawed plan is poor clinical judgment. The suggestion to \"increase interproximal ostectomy\" is nonsensical and would further exacerbate the problem by increasing the contact-to-crest distance, guaranteeing a black triangle.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. There is significant papilla risk; the appropriate response is to perform orthodontic extrusion to move the contact point further incisally by approximately $0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ so the papilla has more room to regenerate.**\n- This option correctly identifies the risk. However, the proposed solution is flawed. Orthodontic extrusion moves the tooth coronally, which is the opposite of what is needed for crown lengthening. Furthermore, moving the contact point *incisally* (away from the bone) would *increase* the contact-to-crest distance, making the problem worse, not better.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. There is moderate papilla risk; the preferred alternative is orthodontic intrusion of both incisors by approximately $0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ to reduce the contact–to–crest distance to $4.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ without altering the interproximal bony crest.**\n- This option correctly identifies the risk. Orthodontic intrusion is a valid technique for some crown lengthening cases, as it moves the tooth apically, exposing more crown and reducing the contact-to-crest distance. However, it is a complex, time-consuming (months to years), and expensive alternative to a direct surgical modification. It is not the \"most appropriate modification\" of the proposed surgical plan. Furthermore, a $0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ intrusion would only achieve half of the desired $1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ of crown lengthening, making it an incomplete solution for the stated restorative goal. The surgical modification in option A is more direct, efficient, and addresses the problem completely.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4716900"}]}
