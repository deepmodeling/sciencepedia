The use of a Poisson distribution to model the distribution of rare events (the presence of a clonogenic cell) is a cornerstone of this method.

A solution will be derived based on the provided assumptions.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to derive an estimator for the clonogenic frequency, $f$, defined as the probability that a single cell is clonogenic. We are given that $N$ cells are seeded per well.\n\nAccording to the problem's assumptions, the distribution of clonogenic cells among the wells follows a Poisson process. Let $\\lambda$ be the average number of clonogenic cells per well. This parameter $\\lambda$ is the product of the total number of cells seeded per well, $N$, and the frequency of clonogenic cells, $f$.\n$$ \\lambda = N \\times f $$\nThe number of clonogenic cells, $K$, in any given well is a random variable that follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$. The probability of finding exactly $k$ clonogenic cells in a well is given by the Poisson probability mass function:\n$$ P(K=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!} $$\nwhere $k$ is a non-negative integer ($k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$).\n\nThe problem states that a colony is observed if and only if at least one clonogenic cell is present in the well (single-hit model). Conversely, a well contains no colonies if and only if it contains zero clonogenic cells. Let $P_0$ be the probability of a well having no colonies. This corresponds to the case where $k=0$.\n$$ P_0 = P(K=0) $$\nSubstituting $k=0$ into the Poisson probability mass function, we get:\n$$ P_0 = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!} $$\nUsing the mathematical facts that $\\lambda^0 = 1$ and $0! = 1$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ P_0 = \\exp(-\\lambda) $$\nThis equation connects the theoretically expected fraction of negative wells, $P_0$, to the average number of clonogenic cells per well, $\\lambda$. In practice, we use the observed fraction of negative wells as an estimate for the probability $P_0$.\n\nWe can now solve for $\\lambda$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln(P_0) = \\ln(\\exp(-\\lambda)) $$\n$$ \\ln(P_0) = -\\lambda $$\n$$ \\lambda = -\\ln(P_0) $$\nWe have two expressions for $\\lambda$: $\\lambda = N \\times f$ and $\\lambda = -\\ln(P_0)$. By equating these, we can establish a relationship to solve for $f$.\n$$ N \\times f = -\\ln(P_0) $$\nSolving for the clonogenic frequency $f$ gives the desired estimator:\n$$ f = -\\frac{\\ln(P_0)}{N} $$\nThis expression provides the estimator for the clonogenic frequency, $f$, in terms of the number of cells seeded per well, $N$, and the observed fraction of colony-negative wells, $P_0$.\n\nNow, we use the specific data provided in the problem to compute the numerical estimate of $f$.\nThe given values are:\n- $N = 100$\n- $P_0 = 0.22$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for $f$:\n$$ f = -\\frac{\\ln(0.22)}{100} $$\nFirst, we compute the natural logarithm of $0.22$:\n$$ \\ln(0.22) \\approx -1.5141275 $$\nNow, we substitute this value back into the equation for $f$:\n$$ f \\approx -\\frac{-1.5141275}{100} = 0.015141275 $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ f \\approx 0.01514 $$\nThus, the estimated clonogenic frequency of the mesenchymal stem cells in the primary culture is approximately $0.01514$, or about $1$ in every $66$ cells.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.01514}$$", "id": "4769319"}, {"introduction": "Once a cell population is known to contain clonogenic progenitors, it is essential to confirm their identity according to established standards.

This method is commonly known as the comparative $C_t$ method or the $\\Delta\\Delta C_t$ method.\n\nThe fundamental assumption of qPCR is that the amount of DNA amplicon, $N$, doubles with each cycle under ideal conditions.
