Assume purely diffusive transport with no bulk flow and negligible reaction or consumption, and consider one-dimensional transport across the thickness.

The biological processes mentioned—salivary gland branching morphogenesis and periodontal ligament fibroblast alignment—are complex events that occur over much longer time scales, typically requiring culture periods of several days to weeks.\n\nSince the time scale for diffusive relaxation of the FGF2 gradient ($\\sim$1.4 hours) is orders of magnitude shorter than the time scale of the biological response (days to weeks), an initially established gradient would become nearly uniform long before the cells could complete the complex processes of migration, proliferation, and organization. For a spatial cue to be effective, it must be stable and persistent.\n\nTherefore, immobilization strategies are essential to maintain a spatial FGF2 gradient over typical culture times. A system where FGF2 is free to diffuse is inadequate. To overcome this rapid dissipation, FGF2 can be tethered to the hydrogel matrix, for instance through covalent conjugation or affinity-based interactions (e.g., using heparin). Such strategies drastically reduce the effective mobility of FGF2, extending the gradient's lifetime to be commensurate with the biological time scale, thereby ensuring that cells receive a consistent directional signal.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{5.00 \\times 10^3}\n$$", "id": "4773923"}, {"introduction": "Functional tissues are not static; they exist in a dynamic mechanical environment.

The correct option must be accurate in all four aspects.\n\n**1. Derivation of Wall Shear Stress ($\\tau_w$)**\nFor steady, fully developed laminar flow in a pipe (Poiseuille flow), the velocity profile is parabolic: $u(r) = u_{max}(1 - r^2/R^2)$. The volumetric flow rate $Q$ is the integral of the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area, which yields $Q = \\frac{1}{2} u_{max} \\pi R^2$. The wall shear stress $\\tau_w$ is given by $\\tau_w = -\\mu \\frac{du}{dr}|_{r=R}$. The velocity gradient is $\\frac{du}{dr} = u_{max}(-2r/R^2)$. At the wall ($r=R$), this is $\\frac{du}{dr}|_{r=R} = -2u_{max}/R$. Thus, $\\tau_w = \\mu(2u_{max}/R)$. We can express $u_{max}$ in terms of $Q$ as $u_{max} = 2Q/(\\pi R^2)$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\tau_w$ gives:\n$$ \\tau_w = \\mu \\frac{2}{R} \\left( \\frac{2Q}{\\pi R^2} \\right) = \\frac{4\\mu Q}{\\pi R^3} $$\nThis matches the formula in options A, C, and D.\n\n**2. Numerical Calculation**\nWe use the derived formula with the given parameters in SI units:\n- $\\mu = 1\\,\\mathrm{mPa\\cdot s} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$\n- $R = 150\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $Q = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L/min} = 2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^3/min} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-9}}{60}\\,\\mathrm{m^3/s} = \\frac{1}{30} \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^3/s}$\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n$$ \\tau_w = \\frac{4 (1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}) (\\frac{1}{30} \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^3/s})}{\\pi (1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3} \\approx 0.012575\\,\\mathrm{Pa} \\approx 0.0126\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\nUsing the conversion $1\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 10\\,\\mathrm{dyn/cm^2}$, we get:\n$$ \\tau_w \\approx 0.0126\\,\\mathrm{Pa} \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{dyn/cm^2}/\\mathrm{Pa} = 0.126\\,\\mathrm{dyn/cm^2} $$\nThis calculation matches the values reported in Option A.\n\n**3.

Biological Justification**\nThe problem asks for a target range that promotes epithelial health. Ductal epithelial cells, unlike vascular endothelial cells, are adapted to low shear stress. Pathologically high shear ($>5-10\\,\\mathrm{dyn/cm^2}$) can be injurious, while near-zero shear can lead to loss of differentiated phenotype. A range of $0.1$–$2\\,\\mathrm{dyn/cm^2}$ is widely recognized in the literature as a physiological range that supports epithelial cell polarization, junctional integrity, and mechanosensing via cilia and other pathways without causing damage. The calculated shear stress of $\\approx 0.126\\,\\mathrm{dyn/cm^2}$ falls at the lower end of this healthy range.\n- Option A suggests a range of $0.1$–$2\\,\\mathrm{dyn/cm^2}$, which is appropriate.\n- Option B incorrectly suggests using the much higher range for endothelial cells.\n- Option C incorrectly suggests a near-zero range, which may be suboptimal.\n- Option D suggests a range exceeding $5\\,\\mathrm{dyn/cm^2}$, which would likely be injurious.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption A correctly provides the derived formula, the numerical calculation of wall shear stress and the Reynolds number, and the appropriate biological context and target range.
