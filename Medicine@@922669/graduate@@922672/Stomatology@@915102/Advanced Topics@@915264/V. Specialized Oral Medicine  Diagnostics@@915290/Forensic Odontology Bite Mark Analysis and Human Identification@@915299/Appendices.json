It is a well-posed problem in applied mechanics, specifically contact mechanics, grounded in established physical principles. The premises and data are internally consistent, and the questions posed are objective and formalizable.\n\nThe problem consists of two main parts: first, a numerical calculation of contact pressure, and second, a symbolic derivation and physical consistency discussion related to elastic half-space theory.\n\n### Part 1: Computation of Peak Nominal Contact Pressure\n\nThe problem asks for the peak nominal contact pressure, $p$, under the assumption that the normal stress is uniformly distributed over the contact area.\n\nThe definition of pressure (or normal stress) is the force, $F$, applied perpendicularly to a surface, divided by the area, $A$, over which the force is distributed.\n$$ p = \\frac{F}{A} $$\n\nThe givens are:\n- The net bite force, $F = 300\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n- The projected planform contact area, $A = 2\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the definition of pressure:\n$$ p = \\frac{300\\,\\mathrm{N}}{2\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2}} = 150\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{mm}^{2}} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in megapascal (MPa). The unit conversion is $1\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}$. Since $1\\,\\mathrm{m} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, it follows that $1\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 = (1000\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2 = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$.\nTherefore, $1\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 10^6\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{10^6\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2} = 1\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{mm}^2}$.\n\nThus, the calculated pressure is:\n$$ p = 150\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\n\nThe problem asks to round the answer to three significant figures. The calculated value of $150$ is an exact integer. Reporting it as $150$ is consistent with this requirement.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation and Discussion of Indentation Depth\n\nThis part requires deriving the relationship between indentation depth, $\\delta$, nominal pressure, $p$, punch radius, $a$, and effective modulus, $E^*$, for a rigid, flat-ended circular punch on an elastic half-space.\n\nThe derivation begins with the Boussinesq solution, which gives the vertical surface displacement, $dw$, at a distance $s$ from an applied point load, $dP$:\n$$ dw = \\frac{dP}{\\pi E^{*} s} $$\nwhere $E^{*} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}$ is the effective modulus for the plane strain condition, incorporating Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$.\n\nFor a distributed pressure $p(r')$ over a circular patch of radius $a$, the total displacement at a point is found by integrating the contributions from all infinitesimal loads $dP = p(r') dA'$. For a rigid flat-ended punch, the indentation depth $\\delta$ is uniform for all points $r \\le a$. We can calculate this displacement at the center of the punch ($r=0$).\n\nThe pressure distribution under a rigid flat-ended circular punch that produces a uniform displacement $\\delta$ is not uniform. It is singular at the edge and is given by:\n$$ p(r) = \\frac{F}{2\\pi a \\sqrt{a^2 - r^2}} $$\nwhere $F$ is the total applied force.\n\nTo find the displacement $\\delta$ at the center of the punch, we integrate the Boussinesq solution over the loaded area. An infinitesimal load $dP$ on an annular ring of radius $r'$ and width $dr'$ is $dP = p(r') (2\\pi r' dr')$. Every point on this ring is at a distance $s=r'$ from the center. The displacement $\\delta$ at the center due to this ring is:\n$$ d\\delta = \\frac{dP}{\\pi E^{*} r'} = \\frac{p(r') (2\\pi r' dr')}{\\pi E^{*} r'} = \\frac{2 p(r') dr'}{E^{*}} $$\n\nIntegrating from $r'=0$ to $r'=a$ gives the total indentation depth $\\delta$:\n$$ \\delta = \\int_{0}^{a} d\\delta = \\int_{0}^{a} \\frac{2}{E^{*}} p(r') dr' = \\frac{2}{E^{*}} \\int_{0}^{a} p(r') dr' $$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $p(r')$:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{2}{E^{*}} \\int_{0}^{a} \\frac{F}{2\\pi a \\sqrt{a^2 - r'^2}} dr' = \\frac{F}{\\pi a E^{*}} \\int_{0}^{a} \\frac{dr'}{\\sqrt{a^2 - r'^2}} $$\n\nThe integral is a standard form:\n$$ \\int \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{k^2 - x^2}} = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{x}{k}\\right) + C $$\nApplying this to our integral:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{a} \\frac{dr'}{\\sqrt{a^2 - r'^2}} = \\left[ \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{r'}{a}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{a} = \\arcsin(1) - \\arcsin(0) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 0 = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\n\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\delta$:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{F}{\\pi a E^{*}} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right) = \\frac{F}{2aE^{*}} $$\n\nThe problem asks for this relationship in terms of the nominal pressure, $p$. The nominal pressure is defined as the force $F$ divided by the total punch area $A = \\pi a^2$:\n$$ p = \\frac{F}{A} = \\frac{F}{\\pi a^2} \\implies F = p \\pi a^2 $$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $F$ into the equation for $\\delta$:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{(p \\pi a^2)}{2aE^{*}} = \\frac{\\pi p a}{2E^{*}} $$\nThis is the required symbolic relationship.\n\n### Part 3: Physical Consistency Discussion\n\nWe must now assess if the magnitude of $\\delta$ implied by this relation is physically consistent with a dermal thickness of approximately $2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ when $p \\gg E^{*}$.\n\nThe derived relation is $\\delta = \\frac{\\pi a}{2} \\left( \\frac{p}{E^{*}} \\right)$.\nThe condition $p \\gg E^{*}$ implies that the ratio $\\frac{p}{E^{*}}$ is a number significantly greater than $1$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the punch radius $a$. The contact area is $A = 2\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$. Assuming a circular patch, $A = \\pi a^2$.\n$$ a = \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\approx 0.798\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\n\nThe indentation depth is therefore:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{p}{E^{*}} \\right) \\mathrm{mm} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\left( \\frac{p}{E^{*}} \\right) \\mathrm{mm} \\approx 1.25\\,\\left( \\frac{p}{E^{*}} \\right) \\mathrm{mm} $$\n\nThe elastic half-space model is predicated on the assumption that the indented material is infinitely deep compared to the dimensions of the contact. This assumption becomes invalid when the indentation depth $\\delta$ becomes comparable to or exceeds the actual thickness of the material layer, which in this case is the dermis with a thickness $d_{\\mathrm{dermis}} \\approx 2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nIf $p \\gg E^{*}$, for example, if $\\frac{p}{E^{*}} = 10$, the model predicts an indentation depth of:\n$$ \\delta \\approx 1.25 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 12.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 1.25\\,\\mathrm{cm} $$\nThe problem context provides $p = 150\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ and notes that $E^{*}$ for dermis is in the MPa range (e.g., $1-10\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$). This means the ratio $p/E^*$ is in the range of $15$ to $150$. At the low end of this range ($\\frac{p}{E^{*}} = 15$), the predicted indentation is $\\delta \\approx 1.25 \\times 15\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\approx 19\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nAn indentation depth of $19\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is an order of magnitude larger than the dermal thickness of $2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Such a large deformation would press through the dermis and deep into the subcutaneous fat and muscle, and possibly be arrested by bone. Therefore, the geometric assumption of an elastic half-space is grossly violated.\n\nFurthermore, the model assumes linear elasticity. Strain can be approximated by $\\epsilon \\sim \\delta/a$. For $\\delta = 19\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $a \\approx 0.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, the strain would be $\\epsilon \\sim 24$. This represents a $2400\\%$ strain, which is physically impossible for skin. Biological tissues are highly non-linear and would fail (tear or be perforated) long before reaching such strains.\n\nIn conclusion, the magnitude of $\\delta$ implied by the linear elastic half-space model under the condition $p \\gg E^{*}$ is not physically consistent with the known properties and geometry of a human forearm. The model breaks down due to both geometric constraints (finite layer thickness) and material behavior (non-linearity and failure at large strains).", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{150} $$", "id": "4720217"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the concept of pressure, this practice delves into the diagnostic heart of bite mark analysis: linking specific dental characteristics to patterns left in the skin.

The suspected biter has a maxillary right central incisor with a labio-incisal chip producing a sharp V-shaped notch. The local apex radius of the chipped edge is $r$ and the radius of curvature of the intact incisal edge segments is $R$, with $r \\ll R$. The skin is modeled as a viscoelastic, nearly incompressible soft tissue that responds to normal loading by elastic deformation until a superficial abrasion threshold $p_a$ is exceeded, and exhibits subdermal contusion once a higher threshold $p_c$ is exceeded, with $p_c > p_a$. There is negligible shear and friction ($\\mu \\approx 0$), and there is no sliding during the bite. A light bite (total anterior force $F_{\\ell}$) and a heavy bite (total anterior force $F_{h}$, with $F_{h} \\gg F_{\\ell}$) are considered. The contact area $A$ increases with force because compliant tissue flattens and flows, and the local contact area is smaller at sharper features (near the chipped apex with radius $r$) than at blunter features (the intact edges with radius $R$). The incisal edges are the principal contacting morphology, and the arch form produces a near-elliptical anterior arc in plan view.\n\nFrom first principles, consider $p = F/A$ locally at the incisal edge and at the chipped apex. Under light pressure where $p$ remains below the contusion threshold $p_c$, the outline recorded is dominated by the incisal edges and any localized morphology that concentrates stress. Under heavy pressure where $p$ frequently exceeds $p_c$, viscoelastic creep and increased contact area can alter the apparent outline, including rounding of angular features and broadening of impressed arcs due to contusion halos.\n\nWhich option best predicts how the chipped incisor will alter the outline of the bite mark under light versus heavy pressure, given these constraints?\n\nA. Under light pressure, the chipped incisor produces a sharp, V-shaped notch interrupting the anterior arc, as local $p$ at the apex exceeds $p_a$ but remains below $p_c$.

The concepts of pressure ($p = F/A$), stress concentration at sharp geometric features (represented by $r \\ll R$), and the viscoelastic response of soft tissues are well-established. The injury thresholds ($p_a$ for abrasion, $p_c$ for contusion) provide a clear, formalizable basis for predicting the type of mark. The description of tissue response under heavy load (creep, contusion halos, rounding of features) is consistent with observed phenomena in soft tissue injury. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear initial state (chipped tooth, compliant skin), defines the governing principles, specifies two distinct loading conditions ($F_{\\ell}$ and $F_{h}$), and asks for a qualitative prediction of the outcome under each condition. The provided information is sufficient to deduce a unique qualitative outcome.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, scientific language. Terms are either standard in physics/engineering or explicitly defined within the context of the problem. There are no subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-constructed application of physical principles to a forensic science scenario. I will proceed with the solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis rests on the principle of stress concentration. The local pressure $p$ is inversely proportional to the local contact area $A$ for a given portion of the applied force. The geometry of the indenter dictates the contact area.\n\n1.  **Stress Concentration Analysis:** The chipped V-shaped notch is described as having a very small radius of curvature, $r$, while the intact incisal edge is much blunter, with a larger radius $R$. The condition $r \\ll R$ signifies that the chip is extremely sharp compared to the rest of the biting edge. According to principles of contact mechanics, for a given indentation depth into a compliant material, the contact area is much smaller for a sharper object. Therefore, the local pressure at the apex of the chip ($p_{\\text{chip}}$) will be significantly greater than the pressure along the intact edge ($p_{\\text{edge}}$), i.e., $p_{\\text{chip}} \\gg p_{\\text{edge}}$. The chip acts as a potent stress concentrator.\n\n2.  **Light Bite Scenario ($F_{\\ell}$):**\n    -   The total applied force $F_{\\ell}$ is low.\n    -   The pressure along the broad, intact edges, $p_{\\text{edge}}$, may be insufficient to leave a clear mark, or may only just exceed the abrasion threshold $p_a$.\n    -   However, due to stress concentration, the pressure at the sharp V-shaped notch, $p_{\\text{chip}}$, will be magnified. It is highly probable that $p_{\\text{chip}}$ will exceed the abrasion threshold $p_a$, even if $p_{\\text{edge}}$ does not.\n    -   The problem specifies that under light pressure, $p$ remains below the contusion threshold $p_c$. This means we expect a surface-level injury (abrasion) but no deep bruising.\n    -   Therefore, the bite mark outline will be primarily defined by the features that successfully created an injury. The sharp V-notch will produce a correspondingly sharp V-shaped abrasion that interrupts the otherwise faint or absent arc from the intact incisal edges. The mark's geometry will have high fidelity to the tool's (tooth's) geometry.\n\n3.  **Heavy Bite Scenario ($F_{h}$):**\n    -   The total applied force $F_{h}$ is much larger than $F_{\\ell}$.\n    -   The pressures everywhere, both $p_{\\text{chip}}$ and $p_{\\text{edge}}$, will be significantly elevated. They will now likely exceed the contusion threshold $p_c$.\n    -   As explicitly stated in the problem, this leads to several effects in the viscoelastic tissue:\n        -   **Contusion:** Subdermal hemorrhage (bruising) occurs. Unlike a surface abrasion, a contusion is a three-dimensional injury where blood diffuses into the surrounding tissue. This diffusion creates a \"contusion halo,\" a zone of discoloration larger than the actual contact area, blurring the edges of the mark.\n        -   **Viscoelastic Creep and Flow:** The compliant skin will deform significantly under the high load. Sharp features will be pushed deep into the tissue, which flows around them.\n        -   **Rounding of Features:** The combination of significant tissue flow and the diffuse nature of the resulting contusion means that sharp, angular features in the original tool will be registered as rounded, less distinct features in the final mark. The high-fidelity V-shape seen in the light bite will be \"smeared\" out.\n        -   **Broadening of Arcs:** The entire impression of the incisal edges will appear broader and more diffuse due to the widespread contusion.\n    -   The resulting mark will be dominated by contusions, making it larger, more diffuse, and less representative of the fine details of the dental anatomy compared to the light bite.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under light pressure, the chipped incisor produces a sharp, V-shaped notch interrupting the anterior arc, as local $p$ at the apex exceeds $p_a$ but remains below $p_c$. Under heavy pressure, increased contact area and viscoelastic deformation smooth the outline, broadening and partially obscuring the notch as surrounding tissue yields, with a contusion halo dominating the arc.**\n-   This option's description for the light bite scenario perfectly matches the derivation: stress concentration at the sharp chip causes a high-fidelity abrasion ($p > p_a$).\n-   The description for the heavy bite scenario also aligns perfectly with the derivation: exceeding $p_c$ leads to contusion, and the viscoelastic response of the tissue (creep, flow) causes rounding and broadening, obscuring the sharp details with a diffuse halo.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under light pressure, the chipped incisor has negligible effect and the arc remains continuous. Under heavy pressure, the chip generates a discrete slit-like tear that radiates away from the arc due purely to increased $F_{h}$, even without sliding or shear.**\n-   The light pressure claim is incorrect. The principle of stress concentration ($r \\ll R$) dictates that the sharp chip should have the *most* pronounced effect, not a negligible one.\n-   The heavy pressure claim is incorrect. A \"slit-like tear\" (laceration) is caused by shear failure. The problem explicitly states normal loading with negligible shear ($\\mu \\approx 0$) and no sliding. The expected injury from high compressive pressure is a contusion, not a laceration.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Under light pressure, the chipped incisor leaves only micro-abrasions. Under heavy pressure, the notch becomes sharper and more angular, because increasing $F_{h}$ increases $p$ at the apex without appreciably increasing local $A$, preserving the angularity of the outline.**\n-   The heavy pressure claim is physically incorrect and directly contradicts the problem statement. The prompt specifies that heavy pressure leads to \"rounding of angular features.\" Increasing force on a *compliant* material like skin must increase the contact area. The assertion that the notch becomes *sharper* is the opposite of the expected outcome due to tissue flow and the diffuse nature of bruising.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Under light pressure, the chipped incisor yields two punctate impressions at the chipped site due to dual-edge contact. Under heavy pressure, overall flattening makes the outline more symmetrical, eliminating asymmetries from the chip entirely regardless of force magnitude.**\n-   The light pressure claim misinterprets the geometry. A \"V-shaped notch\" has a single sharp apex (radius $r$) which would produce a single V-shaped mark, not two distinct punctate (dot-like) impressions.\n-   The heavy pressure claim is too absolute and physically implausible. While heavy force and contusion can obscure features, it is unlikely to \"eliminate asymmetries from the chip entirely.\" A significant morphological feature like a chip will leave some corresponding anomaly in the mark, even if it is diffuse and rounded.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4720141"}, {"introduction": "After analyzing the physical characteristics of a mark, a forensic expert must answer the crucial question: \"What does this evidence mean?\" This final practice shifts our focus from physics to the logic of inference, introducing the probabilistic framework essential for evaluating the strength of evidence.

Both $70$ and $115$ are divisible by $5$.\n\n$$70 = 14 \\times 5$$\n$$115 = 23 \\times 5$$\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is:\n\n$$P(H_1 \\mid E) = \\frac{14}{23}$$\n\nThe two requested values are the Likelihood Ratio, which is $14$, and the posterior probability, which is $\\frac{14}{23}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 14  \\frac{14}{23} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4720255"}]}
