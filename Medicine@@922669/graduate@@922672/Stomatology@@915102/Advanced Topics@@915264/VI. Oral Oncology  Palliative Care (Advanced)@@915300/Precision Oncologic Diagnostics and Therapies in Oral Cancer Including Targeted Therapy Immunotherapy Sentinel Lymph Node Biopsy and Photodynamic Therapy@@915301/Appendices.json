The test is a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) enhanced with cytokeratin immunohistochemistry (IHC). In the clinically node-negative population under consideration, the prevalence of occult nodal metastasis is $0.20$. Validation data for the SLNB protocol show a sensitivity of $0.90$ and a specificity of $0.95$.

We use Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D+|T+) = \\frac{P(T+|D+) P(D+)}{P(T+)}$$\nTo calculate this, we first need the total probability of a positive test, $P(T+)$, which is found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+|D+)P(D+) + P(T+|D-)P(D-)$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$P(T+) = (0.90)(0.20) + (0.05)(0.80) = 0.18 + 0.04 = 0.22$$\nNow, we can compute the PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.18}{0.22} = \\frac{18}{22} = \\frac{9}{11} \\approx 0.8182$$\nSo, the positive predictive value is exactly $\\frac{9}{11}$, or approximately $0.8182$.\n\nThe NPV is the probability that a patient with a negative test result is actually disease-free, denoted $P(D-|T-)$.

It contains all necessary information and is free from contradictions or fallacies. The described scenario aligns with established principles of medical physics and biophotonics for Photodynamic Therapy (PDT). Thus, a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of light fluence at the surface of oral mucosa and at a specified depth. We begin by establishing the relationship between the provided physical quantities.\n\nIrradiance, denoted by $I$, is defined as power $P$ per unit area $A$:\n$$I = \\frac{P}{A}$$\nThe units of irradiance provided are milliwatts per square centimeter ($\\text{mW}/\\text{cm}^2$).\n\nFluence, also known as light dose, denoted by $D$, is defined as the total energy $E$ delivered per unit area $A$:\n$$D = \\frac{E}{A}$$\nThe requested units for fluence are joules per square centimeter ($\\text{J}/\\text{cm}^2$).\n\nFor a continuous-wave light source delivering a constant power over a time interval $t$, the energy is related to power by $E = P \\times t$.
