Opioid rotation is a core strategy to improve analgesia and tolerability, but it requires precise calculation to be performed safely.

All necessary data and principles for a unique solution are provided. The scenario is a standard clinical calculation in palliative medicine, based on established pharmacological principles.\n\nThe derivation of the safe total daily oral hydromorphone dose involves three primary steps: calculating the patient's current total daily opioid intake, converting this to an equianalgesic dose of the new opioid, and applying a safety reduction to account for incomplete cross-tolerance.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Total Daily Dose (TDD) of Oral Morphine**\n\nThe patient's current opioid regimen consists of both sustained-release (SR) and immediate-release (IR) morphine. The total daily dose, which we denote as $D_{M, \\text{TDD}}$, is the sum of the daily amounts of each formulation.\n\nThe SR morphine dose is $70 \\, \\text{mg}$ administered every $12$ hours.

We can define a conversion factor, $C$, from morphine to hydromorphone.\n$$C = \\frac{7.5 \\, \\text{mg hydromorphone}}{30 \\, \\text{mg morphine}} = 0.25$$\n\nUsing this factor, we can calculate the equianalgesic total daily dose of hydromorphone, $D_{H, \\text{eq}}$, that corresponds to the patient's current morphine intake.\n$$D_{H, \\text{eq}} = D_{M, \\text{TDD}} \\times C = 170 \\, \\text{mg/day} \\times 0.25 = 42.5 \\, \\text{mg/day}$$\nThis dose, $42.5 \\, \\text{mg/day}$, represents the amount of oral hydromorphone expected to provide the same level of analgesia as the current morphine regimen, assuming complete cross-tolerance.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Dose Reduction for Incomplete Cross-Tolerance**\n\nWhen rotating between opioids, patients may have different sensitivities to the new drug. This phenomenon is known as incomplete cross-tolerance. To mitigate the risk of overdose, a standard safety practice is to reduce the calculated equianalgesic dose. The problem specifies a reduction of $33\\%$.\n\nLet the reduction percentage be $P_{\\text{red}} = 33\\% = 0.33$. The remaining dose fraction is therefore $1 - P_{\\text{red}}$.\n$$1 - 0.33 = 0.67$$\nThe safe target total daily dose of hydromorphone, $D_{H, \\text{safe}}$, is the equianalgesic dose multiplied by this remaining fraction.\n$$D_{H, \\text{safe}} = D_{H, \\text{eq}} \\times (1 - P_{\\text{red}}) = 42.5 \\, \\text{mg/day} \\times 0.67$$\n$$D_{H, \\text{safe}} = 28.475 \\, \\text{mg/day}$$\n\n**Step 4: Final Rounding**\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The calculated dose is $28.475 \\, \\text{mg/day}$. The first two significant figures are $2$ and $8$. The next digit is $4$. Since $4 < 5$, we round down.\n$$D_{H, \\text{final}} \\approx 28 \\, \\text{mg/day}$$\nTherefore, the mathematically justified safe total daily oral hydromorphone dose for this patient is $28 \\, \\text{mg/day}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{28}\n$$", "id": "4746001"}, {"introduction": "Holistic palliative care addresses both physical and psychological distress, including depression, which is common in patients with head and neck cancer.

The process involves several sequential calculations.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total Patient Health Questionnaire-$9$ (PHQ-$9$) score, denoted by $S$. The score $S$ is the sum of the scores for the $9$ individual items. The given item scores are:\nItem $1$: $2$\nItem $2$: $3$\nItem $3$: $2$\nItem $4$: $2$\nItem $5$: $1$\nItem $6$: $2$\nItem $7$: $1$\nItem $8$: $2$\nItem $9$: $0$\n\nThe total score $S$ is the summation of these values:\n$$S = 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 15$$\nAccording to the provided severity strata, a score of $S=15$ falls into the 'moderately severe' depression category ($S \\in [15,19]$).\n\nNext, we evaluate the four decision components: the severity gate $E$, the swallowing route factor $W$, the cardiac safety factor $Q$, and the interaction factor $M$.\n\nThe severity gate $E$ is defined by the Heaviside step function, $E = H(S-10)$, where $H(x)=1$ for $x \\ge 0$ and $H(x)=0$ for $x < 0$. The threshold for considering pharmacotherapy is $S \\ge 10$.

Therefore, the severity gate is:\n$$E = 1$$\n\nThe swallowing route factor $W$ is determined by the patient's ability to take oral pills. The problem states that $W=1$ if the mucositis grade is less than $3$. The patient's mucositis is graded as $2$. Since $2 < 3$, the condition is met. Thus, the swallowing route factor is:\n$$W = 1$$\n\nThe cardiac safety factor $Q$ depends on the corrected QT interval ($\\mathrm{QTc}$). The rule is that $Q=1$ if $\\mathrm{QTc} < 500$ $\\mathrm{ms}$. The patient's most recent electrocardiogram shows a $\\mathrm{QTc}$ of $465$ $\\mathrm{ms}$. Since $465 < 500$, the condition for cardiac safety is satisfied. Therefore, the cardiac safety factor is:\n$$Q = 1$$\n\nThe interaction factor $M$ accounts for contraindications with specific medications. The rule states $M=1$ if neither monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) nor linezolid are being used. The problem explicitly states \"no use of monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI)\" and \"no linezolid\". Both conditions are met.
