The area $A$ of a right triangle with base $b$ and height $h$ is given by the formula:\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2} b h$$\nSubstituting the expression for the area $A$ into the volume formula, we get the volume of the right triangular prism:\n$$V = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} b h\\right) L$$\nThe problem provides the dimensions in millimeters ($\\text{mm}$):\n-   $b = 20 \\text{ mm}$\n-   $h = 8 \\text{ mm}$\n-   $L = 12 \\text{ mm}$\n\nFirst, we will calculate the volume in cubic millimeters ($\\text{mm}^3$).\n$$V = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (20 \\text{ mm}) \\times (8 \\text{ mm}) \\times (12 \\text{ mm})$$\n$$V = (10 \\text{ mm}) \\times (8 \\text{ mm}) \\times (12 \\text{ mm})$$\n$$V = (80 \\text{ mm}^2) \\times (12 \\text{ mm})$$\n$$V = 960 \\text{ mm}^3$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in cubic centimeters ($\\text{cm}^3$). We use the conversion factor between millimeters and centimeters:\n$$1 \\text{ cm} = 10 \\text{ mm}$$\nTo convert a volume, we must cube the linear conversion factor:\n$$1 \\text{ cm}^3 = (10 \\text{ mm})^3 = 1000 \\text{ mm}^3$$\nTherefore, to convert the volume from $\\text{mm}^3$ to $\\text{cm}^3$, we must divide by $1000$.\n$$V_{\\text{cm}^3} = \\frac{V_{\\text{mm}^3}}{1000}$$\n$$V_{\\text{cm}^3} = \\frac{960}{1000} \\text{ cm}^3 = 0.96 \\text{ cm}^3$$\nAlternatively, we can convert the linear dimensions to centimeters before calculating the volume:\n-   $b = 20 \\text{ mm} = 2.0 \\text{ cm}$\n-   $h = 8 \\text{ mm} = 0.8 \\text{ cm}$\n-   $L = 12 \\text{ mm} = 1.2 \\text{ cm}$\nNow, we calculate the volume using these dimensions:\n$$V = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (2.0 \\text{ cm}) \\times (0.8 \\text{ cm}) \\times (1.2 \\text{ cm})$$\n$$V = (1.0 \\text{ cm}) \\times (0.8 \\text{ cm}) \\times (1.2 \\text{ cm})$$\n$$V = 0.8 \\text{ cm}^2 \\times 1.2 \\text{ cm}$$\n$$V = 0.96 \\text{ cm}^3$$\nThe problem states that the final answer must be rounded to four significant figures.
