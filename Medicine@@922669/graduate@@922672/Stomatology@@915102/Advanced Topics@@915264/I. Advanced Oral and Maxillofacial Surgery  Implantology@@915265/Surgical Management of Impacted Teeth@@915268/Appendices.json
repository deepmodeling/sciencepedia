The pretest probability of true inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) contact, based on population risk and cone-beam computed tomography availability constraints, is $0.10$. On the preoperative panoramic radiograph, a Rood sign (darkening of the root with canal diversion) is observed and considered as a binary diagnostic test, where its sensitivity is $0.80$ and its specificity is $0.70$ for detecting true IAN contact. Using the fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and conditional probability to update the probability after a positive test, determine the posttest probability of true IAN contact given the positive Rood sign. Express your final answer as a decimal and round to four significant figures.", "solution": "Let us define the following events:\n- $D$: The event that true inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) contact exists. This corresponds to the presence of the condition.\n- $\\neg D$: The event that there is no true IAN contact. This corresponds to the absence of the condition.\n- $T$: The event that the Rood sign is observed on the radiograph. This corresponds to a positive test result.\n- $\\neg T$: The event that the Rood sign is not observed. This corresponds to a negative test result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1. The pretest probability of true IAN contact, which is the prior probability of the condition, $P(D)$.\n$$ P(D) = 0.10 $$\nFrom this, the prior probability of no IAN contact is:\n$$ P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 $$\n\n2. The sensitivity of the Rood sign. Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test ($T$) given that the condition is present ($D$).\n$$ P(T|D) = 0.80 $$\n\n3. The specificity of the Rood sign. Specificity is the probability of a negative test ($\\neg T$) given that the condition is absent ($\\neg D$).\n$$ P(\\neg T|\\neg D) = 0.70 $$\n\nFrom the specificity, we can determine the probability of a positive test given that the condition is absent ($\\neg D$).

This is the posterior probability, denoted as $P(D|T)$. We use Bayes' theorem to calculate this value:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. It can be found using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|\\neg D)P(\\neg D) $$\nSubstituting this into Bayes' theorem gives the full expression:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|\\neg D)P(\\neg D)} $$\nNow, we substitute the known numerical values into this equation.\nThe numerator represents the probability of a true positive result:\n$$ P(T|D)P(D) = (0.80)(0.10) = 0.08 $$\nThe denominator's second term represents the probability of a false positive result:\n$$ P(T|\\neg D)P(\\neg D) = (0.30)(0.90) = 0.27 $$\nThe total probability of a positive test, $P(T)$, is the sum of the probabilities of true positives and false positives:\n$$ P(T) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 $$\nFinally, we can calculate the posttest probability $P(D|T)$:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{0.08}{0.35} \\approx 0.2285714... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$ P(D|T) \\approx 0.2286 $$\nThus, the posttest probability of true IAN contact, given the observation of a positive Rood sign, is approximately $0.2286$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2286}$$", "id": "4770356"}, {"introduction": "Following risk assessment, precise surgical planning is crucial for mitigating potential complications.

Let us define a coordinate system where the $x$-axis is normal to the buccal cortical plate, pointing towards the lingual side, and the origin ($x=0$) is set at the outer surface of the buccal cortex where the osteotomy begins.\n\nFirst, we determine the maximum permissible horizontal penetration distance, $x_{safe}$. The various anatomical boundaries are located along the $x$-axis based on the provided CBCT measurements:\n- Buccal cortical thickness: $t_b = 1.5\\,\\text{mm}$\n- Intervening cancellous span: $c_s = 6.2\\,\\text{mm}$\n- Safety clearance from the inner lingual cortex: $s_c = 1.0\\,\\text{mm}$\n\nThe inner surface of the lingual cortex is located at a horizontal distance of $t_b + c_s$ from the start point. The safety boundary is $s_c$ buccal to this point.

The depth $d$ is measured along the bur axis, which is angled at $\\alpha$ relative to the horizontal $x$-axis. The horizontal penetration of the bur tip, $x_{tip}$, is the side of a right-angled triangle adjacent to the angle $\\alpha$, where $d$ is the hypotenuse. The relationship is:\n$$x_{tip} = d \\cos(\\alpha)$$\nTo adhere to the safety clearance, the horizontal penetration must not exceed $x_{safe}$:\n$$d \\cos(\\alpha) \\le x_{safe}$$\nThis allows us to express the allowable depth $d$ as a function of the angle $\\alpha$:\n$$d(\\alpha) \\le \\frac{x_{safe}}{\\cos(\\alpha)}$$\nTo maximize the trough depth $d(\\alpha)$, we must maximize the expression $\\frac{x_{safe}}{\\cos(\\alpha)}$.
