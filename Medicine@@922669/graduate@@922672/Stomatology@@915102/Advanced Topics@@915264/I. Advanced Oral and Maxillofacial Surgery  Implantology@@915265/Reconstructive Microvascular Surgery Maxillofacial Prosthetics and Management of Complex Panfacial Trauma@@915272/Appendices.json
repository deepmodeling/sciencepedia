We will perform this calculation in conventional medical units ($\\text{mL O}_2/\\text{dL blood}$) first for clarity.\n\n Oxygen bound to hemoglobin ($O_{2,Hb}$):\n $$O_{2,Hb} = [\\text{Hb}] \\times S_{aO_2} \\times \\text{Binding Capacity}$$\n $$O_{2,Hb} = (13.5\\ \\text{g/dL}) \\times (0.97) \\times (1.34\\ \\text{mL O}_2/\\text{g Hb}) = 17.5347\\ \\text{mL O}_2/\\text{dL}$$\n\n Dissolved oxygen ($O_{2,dissolved}$):\n $$O_{2,dissolved} = P_{aO_2} \\times \\text{Solubility}$$\n $$O_{2,dissolved} = (90\\ \\text{mmHg}) \\times (0.003\\ \\text{mL O}_2/(\\text{dL}\\cdot\\text{mmHg})) = 0.27\\ \\text{mL O}_2/\\text{dL}$$\n\n Total arterial oxygen content ($C_{aO_2}$):\n $$C_{aO_2} = O_{2,Hb} + O_{2,dissolved} = 17.5347 + 0.27 = 17.8047\\ \\text{mL O}_2/\\text{dL}$$\n\n For subsequent calculations in SI units, we convert $C_{aO_2}$ into a dimensionless volume fraction (volume of oxygen per volume of blood):\n $$C_{aO_2} = \\frac{17.8047\\ \\text{mL}}{1\\ \\text{dL}} = \\frac{17.8047\\ \\text{mL}}{100\\ \\text{mL}} = 0.178047$$\n\n**Step 2: Determine Minimal Blood Flow ($Q_{\\min}$)**\nThe Fick principle relates oxygen consumption ($V_{O_2}$), blood flow ($Q$), and the arteriovenous oxygen content difference ($C_{aO_2} - C_{vO_2}$).\n$$V_{O_2} = Q \\times (C_{aO_2} - C_{vO_2})$$\nThe oxygen extraction ratio, $E$, is defined as $E = (C_{aO_2} - C_{vO_2}) / C_{aO_2}$. Substituting this into the Fick equation gives:\n$$V_{O_2} = Q \\times E \\times C_{aO_2}$$\nTo find the minimal flow, $Q_{\\min}$, required to sustain the flap, we use the maximal safe oxygen extraction ratio, $E_{\\max}$:\n$$Q_{\\min} = \\frac{V_{O_2}}{E_{\\max} \\times C_{aO_2}}$$\nUsing the values in SI units:\n$$Q_{\\min} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{m}^3/\\text{s}}{0.60 \\times 0.178047} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-8}}{0.1068282} \\approx 4.6803 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{m}^3/\\text{s}$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Total Hydraulic Resistance ($R_{\\text{total}}$)**\nThe hydraulic resistance of a single cylindrical vessel under laminar flow is given by Poiseuille's law:\n$$R = \\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r^4}$$\nA single microvascular unit consists of an arteriole, a capillary, and a venule in series, so their resistances add up:\n$$R_{\\text{unit}} = R_a + R_c + R_v$$\nLet's compute the resistance of each segment:\n$$R_a = \\frac{8 (3.0 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.40 \\times 10^{-3})}{\\pi (30 \\times 10^{-6})^4} = \\frac{9.6 \\times 10^{-6}}{\\pi (81 \\times 10^{-20})} \\approx 3.7725 \\times 10^{10}\\ \\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}/\\text{m}^3$$\n$$R_c = \\frac{8 (3.0 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.80 \\times 10^{-3})}{\\pi (5.0 \\times 10^{-6})^4} = \\frac{19.2 \\times 10^{-6}}{\\pi (625 \\times 10^{-24})} \\approx 9.7785 \\times 10^{15}\\ \\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}/\\text{m}^3$$\n$$R_v = \\frac{8 (3.0 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.40 \\times 10^{-3})}{\\pi (35 \\times 10^{-6})^4} = \\frac{9.6 \\times 10^{-6}}{\\pi (1.500625 \\times 10^{-18})} \\approx 2.0363 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}/\\text{m}^3$$\nThe total resistance of one unit is:\n$$R_{\\text{unit}} = (3.7725 \\times 10^{10}) + (9.7785 \\times 10^{15}) + (2.0363 \\times 10^{12}) \\approx 9.7806 \\times 10^{15}\\ \\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}/\\text{m}^3$$\nThe resistance is dominated by the capillary segment, as expected from the $r^4$ dependence.\n\nThe flap contains $N = 2.0 \\times 10^6$ total units, of which a fraction $f = 0.60$ are patent. The number of patent units is:\n$$N_{\\text{patent}} = N \\times f = (2.0 \\times 10^6) \\times 0.60 = 1.2 \\times 10^6$$\nThese patent units are arranged in parallel. The total resistance of parallel resistors is given by the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals. For identical units:\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{unit}}}{N_{\\text{patent}}}$$\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{9.7806 \\times 10^{15}\\ \\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}/\\text{m}^3}{1.2 \\times 10^6} \\approx 8.1505 \\times 10^9\\ \\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}/\\text{m}^3$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Minimal Perfusion Pressure Gradient ($\\Delta P$ )**\nThe pressure gradient is the product of flow and resistance:\n$$\\Delta P = Q_{\\min} \\times R_{\\text{total}}$$\n$$\\Delta P = (4.6803 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{m}^3/\\text{s}) \\times (8.1505 \\times 10^9\\ \\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}/\\text{m}^3) \\approx 3814.7\\ \\text{Pa}$$\n\nFinally, we convert the pressure from Pascals ($\\text{Pa}$) to millimeters of mercury ($\\text{mmHg}$) and round to three significant figures as requested.\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{mmHg}} = \\frac{3814.7\\ \\text{Pa}}{133.322\\ \\text{Pa/mmHg}} \\approx 28.613\\ \\text{mmHg}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the minimal mean perfusion pressure is $28.6\\ \\text{mmHg}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{28.6}$$", "id": "4765696"}]}
