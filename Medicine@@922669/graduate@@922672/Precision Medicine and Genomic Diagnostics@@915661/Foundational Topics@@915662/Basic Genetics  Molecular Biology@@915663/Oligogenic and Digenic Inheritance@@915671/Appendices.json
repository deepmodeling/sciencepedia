Do not round or attach units.", "solution": "The solution is developed in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Penetrance Table Construction**\n\nThe problem defines a digenic inheritance model where the phenotype is expressed if and only if an individual carries at least one pathogenic allele at each of two loci, locus A and locus B. The pathogenic alleles are denoted by $a$ and $b$, respectively. Complete penetrance implies that if the genetic condition is met, the phenotype is always expressed (penetrance $1$), and if the condition is not met, the phenotype is never expressed (penetrance $0$).\n\nThe joint genotypes are combinations of the genotypes at each locus: {$AA$, $Aa$, $aa$} for locus A and {$BB$, $Bb$, $bb$} for locus B.\n\nThe condition for phenotype expression (penetrance $= 1$) is:\n(Genotype at locus A is $Aa$ or $aa$) AND (Genotype at locus B is $Bb$ or $bb$).\n\nWe evaluate this condition for each of the $3 \\times 3 = 9$ possible joint genotypes:\n-   If the genotype at locus A is $AA$, the condition \"at least one $a$\" is not met. Thus, for any genotype at locus B ($BB$, $Bb$, or $bb$), the penetrance is $0$.\n-   If the genotype at locus B is $BB$, the condition \"at least one $b$\" is not met. Thus, for any genotype at locus A ($AA$, $Aa$, or $aa$), the penetrance is $0$.\n-   If the genotype at locus A is $Aa$ or $aa$ AND the genotype at locus B is $Bb$ or $bb$, both conditions are met, and the penetrance is $1$.\n\nThis logic leads to the following penetrance table, where rows represent the genotype at locus A and columns represent the genotype at locus B. The entries are the penetrance values ($0$ or $1$).\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\n\\text{Locus A} \\setminus \\text{Locus B}  BB  Bb  bb \\\\\n\\hline\nAA  0  0  0 \\\\\nAa  0  1  1 \\\\\naa  0  1  1 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Expected Population Frequency of the Phenotype**\n\nThe expected population frequency of the phenotype, which we denote $P(\\text{affected})$, is the sum of the frequencies of all genotypes that result in a penetrance of $1$. This corresponds to the probability that a randomly chosen individual from the population will possess a genotype that causes the phenotype.\n\nThe problem states that the population is large, randomly mating, in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) at each locus, and exhibits no linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the two loci.\n\nLet $q_{A}$ be the frequency of the pathogenic allele $a$, and $p_{A} = 1 - q_{A}$ be the frequency of the normal allele $A$.\nLet $q_{B}$ be the frequency of the pathogenic allele $b$, and $p_{B} = 1 - q_{B}$ be the frequency of the normal allele $B$.\n\nThe phenotype is expressed if and only if the individual has at least one $a$ allele AND at least one $b$ allele. Let $E_{A}$ be the event that an individual has at least one $a$ allele, and $E_{B}$ be the event that an individual has at least one $b$ allele. The frequency of the phenotype is the probability of the joint event $E_{A} \\cap E_{B}$.\n\nThe assumption of no linkage disequilibrium means that the genotypes at the two loci are statistically independent. Therefore, the events $E_{A}$ and $E_{B}$ are independent, and the joint probability is the product of the marginal probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{affected}) = P(E_{A} \\cap E_{B}) = P(E_{A}) \\times P(E_{B})$$\n\nWe now calculate $P(E_{A})$ and $P(E_{B})$.\nThe event $E_{A}$ corresponds to an individual having genotype $Aa$ or $aa$. It is simpler to calculate this probability using the complement event, \"not $E_{A}$\", which corresponds to having genotype $AA$.\nUnder HWE, the frequency of the $AA$ genotype is $P(AA) = p_{A}^{2} = (1 - q_{A})^{2}$.\nThe probability of event $E_{A}$ is therefore:\n$$P(E_{A}) = 1 - P(\\text{not } E_{A}) = 1 - P(AA) = 1 - (1 - q_{A})^{2}$$\nExpanding the squared term gives:\n$$P(E_{A}) = 1 - (1 - 2q_{A} + q_{A}^{2}) = 1 - 1 + 2q_{A} - q_{A}^{2} = 2q_{A} - q_{A}^{2}$$\n\nBy symmetry, for locus B, the probability of having at least one $b$ allele, $P(E_{B})$, is:\n$$P(E_{B}) = 1 - P(BB) = 1 - p_{B}^{2} = 1 - (1 - q_{B})^{2} = 2q_{B} - q_{B}^{2}$$\n\nFinally, we multiply these two probabilities to find the total frequency of the phenotype in the population:\n$$P(\\text{affected}) = P(E_{A}) \\times P(E_{B}) = (2q_{A} - q_{A}^{2})(2q_{B} - q_{B}^{2})$$\n\nThis is the simplified, closed-form expression for the expected population frequency of the phenotype in terms of the pathogenic allele frequencies $q_{A}$ and $q_{B}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(2q_{A} - q_{A}^{2})(2q_{B} - q_{B}^{2})}$$", "id": "4365057"}, {"introduction": "While many introductory problems assume independent assortment, genes located near each other on the same chromosome are often inherited together, a phenomenon known as genetic linkage. This exercise explores how linkage and the specific arrangement of alleles on parental chromosomes (haplotype phase) impact familial recurrence risk in digenic disease [@problem_id:4365061]. By calculating the risk difference between 'cis' and 'trans' configurations, you will gain insight into how recombination frequency ($r$) directly influences disease transmission, a critical concept in genetic counseling and linkage analysis.", "problem": "In digenic inheritance, disease occurs when an individual carries at least one deleterious allele at each of two loci, denoted by locus $A$ with alleles $A$ (deleterious) and $a$ (reference), and locus $B$ with alleles $B$ (deleterious) and $b$ (reference). Consider a nuclear family in which one parent is a double heterozygote and the other parent is a non-carrier. Specifically, the transmitting parent has two phased haplotypes and is either in the cis (coupling) phase $AB/ab$ or in the trans (repulsion) phase $Ab/aB$. The other parent is $ab/ab$. Assume the following fundamental bases:\n- Mendel’s law of segregation and the standard meiotic recombination model with recombination fraction $r$ between loci $A$ and $B$, where $0 \\leq r \\leq \\tfrac{1}{2}$.\n- No de novo mutation, no gene conversion, and no transmission distortion.\n- Penetrance $f$ is the probability of disease conditional on carrying at least one $A$ allele and at least one $B$ allele; all other genotypes have penetrance $0$.\n\nUsing these bases, derive from first principles the expected transmission probabilities that an offspring inherits both $A$ and $B$ alleles under the cis and trans configurations. Then, compute the disease risks for the offspring under each configuration as functions of $r$ and $f$, and finally provide a single simplified analytic expression for the risk difference\n$$\\Delta R(r,f) = R_{\\text{cis}}(r,f) - R_{\\text{trans}}(r,f).$$\nExpress your final answer as a closed-form expression in terms of $r$ and $f$ only. No rounding is required, and no units apply.", "solution": "The problem requires calculating the disease risk, $R$, for an offspring under two scenarios for the parental genotype configuration (cis and trans) and then finding the difference between these risks.\n\nThe mating is between a double heterozygote parent ($A/a; B/b$) and a non-carrier parent ($ab/ab$). The non-carrier parent can only produce gametes of type $ab$. Therefore, the genotype of the offspring is determined solely by the gamete inherited from the double heterozygote parent. According to the problem statement, a disease phenotype requires a genotype with at least one deleterious allele $A$ and at least one deleterious allele $B$. Given that the second parent is $ab/ab$, the only way for an offspring to meet this condition is to inherit an $AB$ gamete from the heterozygous parent, resulting in the genotype $AB/ab$. All other offspring genotypes ($Ab/ab$, $aB/ab$, $ab/ab$) will not have both deleterious alleles and thus will have a disease penetrance of 0.\n\nThe disease risk, $R$, is the probability that an offspring develops the disease. This is the probability of inheriting the disease-causing genotype multiplied by the penetrance, $f$:\n$$R = f \\times P(\\text{Offspring inherits an } AB \\text{ gamete})$$\n\nWe must now calculate the probability of the double heterozygote parent producing an $AB$ gamete for both the cis and trans configurations. This probability depends on the recombination fraction, $r$.\n\n**1. Cis (Coupling) Configuration: $AB/ab$**\nIn this configuration, the parental haplotypes are $AB$ and $ab$. Gametes carrying these haplotypes are non-recombinant. The probability of no recombination is $1-r$. This probability is split equally between the two non-recombinant gamete types ($AB$ and $ab$).\nTherefore, the probability of producing an $AB$ gamete is:\n$$P_{\\text{cis}}(\\text{gamete is } AB) = \\frac{1-r}{2}$$\nThe disease risk for the offspring in the cis case, $R_{\\text{cis}}(r,f)$, is:\n$$R_{\\text{cis}}(r,f) = f \\times P_{\\text{cis}}(\\text{gamete is } AB) = f \\left( \\frac{1-r}{2} \\right)$$\n\n**2. Trans (Repulsion) Configuration: $Ab/aB$**\nIn this configuration, the parental haplotypes are $Ab$ and $aB$. Gametes carrying haplotypes $AB$ and $ab$ are now the recombinant ones. The probability of recombination is $r$. This probability is split equally between the two recombinant gamete types ($AB$ and $ab$).\nTherefore, the probability of producing an $AB$ gamete is:\n$$P_{\\text{trans}}(\\text{gamete is } AB) = \\frac{r}{2}$$\nThe disease risk for the offspring in the trans case, $R_{\\text{trans}}(r,f)$, is:\n$$R_{\\text{trans}}(r,f) = f \\times P_{\\text{trans}}(\\text{gamete is } AB) = f \\left( \\frac{r}{2} \\right)$$\n\n**3. Risk Difference: $\\Delta R(r,f)$**\nFinally, we compute the risk difference by subtracting the trans risk from the cis risk:\n$$\\Delta R(r,f) = R_{\\text{cis}}(r,f) - R_{\\text{trans}}(r,f) = f \\left( \\frac{1-r}{2} \\right) - f \\left( \\frac{r}{2} \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta R(r,f) = \\frac{f}{2} ((1-r) - r) = \\frac{f}{2} (1 - 2r)$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression:\n$$\\Delta R(r,f) = f \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - r \\right)$$\nThis expression quantifies how haplotype phase and genetic linkage jointly determine familial disease risk.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{f \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - r \\right)}$$", "id": "4365061"}, {"introduction": "The advent of whole-exome sequencing (WES) has enabled the search for oligogenic disease patterns on an unprecedented scale, but it also presents a significant statistical challenge: separating true signals from random noise.

Derivation of the Expected Number of Spurious Pairs**\n\nThe derivation proceeds in four steps: (1) calculate the probability of an individual carrying a single rare variant, (2) calculate the probability of an individual co-carrying a pair of independent variants, (3) calculate the probability that a specific variant pair is flagged as a candidate based on its cohort frequency, and (4) calculate the total expected number of such pairs across the entire experiment.\n\n**Step 1: Probability of Carrying a Single Rare Variant**\nLet $f$ be the minor allele frequency (MAF) of a variant. Under Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), the probability for a single individual to carry at least one copy of the minor allele, $p_{\\text{carrier}}$, is 1 minus the probability of being homozygous for the major allele:\n$$p_{\\text{carrier}} = 1 - (1-f)^2 = 1 - (1 - 2f + f^2) = 2f - f^2$$\n\n**Step 2: Probability of Co-Carrying a Variant Pair**\nThe null model assumes the two loci are independent.
