Sequencing pipelines often produce Variant Call Format (VCF) files where deletions are \"left-normalized\" for computational consistency. This practice [@problem_id:4343240] requires you to convert such a VCF-based description into the correct HGVS format, which mandates shifting variants in repetitive sequences to the most 3' position possible. Mastering this 3'-normalization is essential for ensuring that variant descriptions are unambiguous and reflect the underlying biology consistently across different labs and databases.", "problem": "A human transcript, NM_TX001, is on the positive strand of Chromosome 1. By convention in Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) coding DNA (cDNA) nomenclature, the first coding nucleotide is numbered $c.1$. For NM_TX001, $c.1$ corresponds to genomic coordinate $g=2401$. Consider a local genomic reference segment from $g=2499$ through $g=2506$ with the sequence 5'-GAAAAAAT-3' (i.e., at $g=2499$ is G, at $g=2500$ through $g=2505$ are A, and at $g=2506$ is T). A Variant Call Format (VCF) record describes a left-normalized deletion using REF and ALT as follows: `CHROM=chr1`, `POS=2499`, `REF=\"GAA\"`, `ALT=\"G\"`. Assume standard VCF conventions (the POS coordinate refers to the leftmost reference base included in REF, and deletions are represented with an anchor base).\n\nUsing the fundamental definitions of HGVS variant representation on cDNA and the HGVS \"most 3' rule\" for repetitive sequences, and reconciling the difference between VCF left-normalization and HGVS 3'-normalization on a positive-strand transcript, determine the starting $c.$ coordinate (an integer) of the correct HGVS coding DNA deletion representation for this variant. Provide only the starting $c.$ coordinate as your final answer. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires a three-step process: first, interpreting the VCF record to understand the genomic variant; second, applying the HGVS 3'-normalization rule to this variant; and third, converting the resulting genomic coordinates to HGVS coding DNA ($c.$) coordinates.\n\n**Step 1: Interpretation of the VCF Record**\nThe VCF record is given as: `POS=2499`, `REF=\"GAA\"`, `ALT=\"G\"`. In VCF format for deletions, the `POS` field indicates the first reference base, and the `REF` allele contains this anchor base plus the sequence that is deleted. The `ALT` allele contains only the anchor base.\nBy comparing the `REF` and `ALT` alleles, we see that the sequence \"AA\" is deleted. The `REF` allele \"GAA\" corresponds to genomic positions $g=2499$, $g=2500$, and $g=2501$. The deleted portion, \"AA\", therefore corresponds to genomic positions $g=2500$ and $g=2501$. This variant, in its left-normalized VCF form, represents the deletion `g.2500_2501del`.\n\n**Step 2: Application of the HGVS 3'-Normalization Rule**\nThe HGVS nomenclature standards require that for variants in repetitive sequences, the description must be shifted to the most $3^\\prime$ (three-prime or rightmost) position possible.\nThe deleted sequence is \"AA\". The genomic reference sequence from $g=2499$ to $g=2506$ is `5'-GAAAAAAT-3'`, which contains a run of six 'A's from $g=2500$ to $g=2505$. We must shift the deletion `g.2500_2501del` as far to the right as possible within this repeat tract.\n-   Original (left-normalized): `g.2500_2501del`. Sequence: `G (AA) AAAA T` → `G AAAAT`\n-   Shift 1 right: `g.2501_2502del`. Sequence: `G A (AA) AAA T` → `G AAAAT` (Identical outcome)\n-   Shift 2 right: `g.2502_2503del`. Sequence: `G AA (AA) AA T` → `G AAAAT` (Identical outcome)\n-   Shift 3 right: `g.2503_2504del`. Sequence: `G AAA (AA) A T` → `G AAAAT` (Identical outcome)\n-   Shift 4 right: `g.2504_2505del`. Sequence: `G AAAA (AA) T` → `G AAAAT` (Identical outcome)\n\nA further shift to `g.2505_2506del` would involve deleting \"AT\", which is a different variant. Thus, the most 3'-shifted position for the deletion of \"AA\" is `g.2504_2505del`. This is the correct HGVS representation at the genomic level.\n\n**Step 3: Conversion to HGVS cDNA Coordinates**\nThe transcript is on the positive strand, so cDNA coordinates ($c.$) increase in the same direction as genomic coordinates ($g.$). The conversion is a linear transformation.\nWe are given the anchor point: $c.1$ corresponds to $g=2401$.\nThe conversion formula is $c = g - (\\text{offset})$.\nWe can find the offset: $1 = 2401 - \\text{offset} \\implies \\text{offset} = 2400$.\nThe final formula is $c = g - 2400$.\n\nWe need the starting $c.$ coordinate for the 3'-normalized deletion, `g.2504_2505del`. The starting genomic coordinate is $g_{\\text{start}} = 2504$.\nUsing the conversion formula:\n$c_{\\text{start}} = 2504 - 2400 = 104$.\n\nThe full HGVS description is `c.104_105del`. The problem asks only for the starting $c.$ coordinate.\nThe starting $c.$ coordinate is 104.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{104}\n$$", "id": "4343240"}, {"introduction": "Real genomic data is often messy, presenting as a series of small, adjacent changes rather than a single clean event.

Consider a coding DNA reference sequence around positions c.304–c.313 for a given RefSeq transcript (coding DNA numbering assumes c.1 at the A of the ATG start codon). The local reference, with positions indexed, is as follows:\n- c.304 T, c.305 T, c.306 A, c.307 G, c.308 T, c.309 A, c.310 C, c.311 G, c.312 C, c.313 A.\n\nA patient’s raw variant calls from a pipeline that does not perform HGVS-normalization report the following changes within this window:\n- c.307G>A\n- c.308T>C\n- c.309_310insAA\n- c.311del\n\nUsing only core definitions and principles of HGVS nomenclature, including how to represent single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), deletions, insertions, and deletion–insertions (delins), and the rule that contiguous changes without intervening reference-matching nucleotides must be represented as a single event, do the following:\n1.

Do not include units.", "solution": "This problem requires applying the HGVS rule that contiguous variants must be represented as a single event, typically a deletion-insertion (`delins`).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Affected Reference Sequence**\nThe raw calls affect positions `c.307`, `c.308`, the junction `c.309_310`, and `c.311`. Since these are all adjacent, they form a single contiguous block of change starting at `c.307` and ending at `c.311`. The reference sequence for this affected interval (`c.307` through `c.311`) is `GTACG`. In a `delins` description, this sequence is considered deleted. Therefore, the number of deleted nucleotides is $L = 5$.\n\n**Step 2: Construct the New (Observed) Sequence**\nTo find the inserted sequence for the `delins`, we must determine what sequence replaces the original `GTACG`. We can do this by reconstructing the patient's sequence based on the reference and the raw calls.\n- Reference sequence: `... T T A G T A C G C A ...` (from `c.304` to `c.313`)\n- Patient sequence construction:\n    - Sequence up to `c.306` is unchanged: `...TTA`\n    - At `c.307`, `G` is replaced by `A`.\n    - At `c.308`, `T` is replaced by `C`.\n    - The reference base at `c.309` (`A`) remains.\n    - An `AA` is inserted between `c.309` and `c.310`.\n    - The reference base at `c.310` (`C`) remains.\n    - The reference base at `c.311` (`G`) is deleted.\n    - The sequence from `c.312` onward is unchanged: `CA...`\n\nLet's assemble the new segment that replaces the original `c.307-c.311` block:\nNew sequence = (`A` from c.307G>A) + (`C` from c.308T>C) + (`A` from ref c.309) + (`AA` from ins) + (`C` from ref c.310) = `ACAAAC`.\n\n**Step 3: Align Reference and Patient Sequences**\n- Reference: `... TTA | GTACG | CA ...`\n- Patient:   `...

This exercise [@problem_id:4343304] presents a profound scenario: a deletion that removes the canonical translation initiation codon. By working from first principles, you will determine the correct HGVS protein-level annotation and, in doing so, explore how the nomenclature system formally handles profound uncertainty. This practice illuminates the critical distinction between a predictable outcome (like a frameshift) and a situation where the very existence of a protein product is in question, a vital concept for responsible variant curation.", "problem": "A protein-coding transcript used in clinical diagnostics follows the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) standard for coding DNA and protein variant nomenclature. The coding DNA numbering is defined such that `c.1` is the adenine nucleotide of the canonical start codon, and protein annotation begins at the methionine encoded by this start codon. Consider a secreted protein whose wild-type annotation includes a signal peptide at the $5'$ end of the open reading frame, with a curator-annotated length of $23$ amino acids based on standard signal peptide features. A variant is observed that is a single-nucleotide deletion at `c.1`, creating a non-triplet perturbation of the coding sequence at the first codon. Using only foundational principles—namely the Central Dogma of molecular biology (transcription and translation), the triplet nature of the genetic code, and the HGVS rules for coding DNA ($c.$) and protein ($p.$) descriptions—reason from first principles to determine the correct $c.$ and $p.$ descriptions and analyze the implications for signal peptide annotation.\n\nLet $N$ denote the number of amino acid residues for which a change in identity can be unambiguously asserted under HGVS rules given only this `c.1` single-base deletion and no additional experimental evidence about translation initiation, re-initiation, or alternative start sites.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "This problem requires the application of HGVS nomenclature rules to a variant that abolishes the canonical start codon.\n\n**1. DNA-Level Description**\nThe variant is a single-nucleotide deletion at the first position of the coding DNA. According to HGVS, this is described unambiguously as `c.1del`.\n\n**2. Effect on Translation Initiation**\nThe Central Dogma states that translation initiates at a start codon, which is canonically `ATG` in the DNA, corresponding to `AUG` on the mRNA. The `c.1del` variant destroys this `ATG` codon, changing it to `TG...`. By removing the canonical initiation signal, the process of translation is fundamentally disrupted at this site.\n\n**3. Protein-Level Description (HGVS Rules)**\nThe problem asks for a predicted protein consequence without any experimental data. HGVS has a specific rule for this scenario of profound uncertainty.\n- The wild-type protein starts with Methionine at position 1 (`p.Met1`).\n- The `c.1del` variant removes the codon for `p.Met1`.\n- Without a start codon, it is unknown if translation will occur at all. The ribosome might fail to initiate, or it might initiate at a downstream site. Because the outcome cannot be predicted from the sequence alone, it is formally described as \"unknown\".\n- The correct HGVS protein-level annotation is `p.0?` or `p.Met1?`. Both notations signify that the effect on the protein is unknown. `p.0?` is particularly apt as it indicates that the very existence of a protein product is uncertain.\n\n**4. Calculation of N**\nThe problem defines $N$ as the \"number of amino acid residues for which a change in identity can be unambiguously asserted\".\n- To \"assert\" a change for a residue, one must be able to state its new identity (e.g., `p.Ala5Gly`) or that it is the start of a new reading frame (`p.Ala5fs...`).\n- In this case, the HGVS description is `p.0?` (unknown). This is an explicit declaration of ignorance. We cannot assert that `p.Met1` has changed to a new amino acid, because we do not know if a protein is synthesized. We cannot assert a frameshift, because the reference point for the reading frame—the start codon—is gone.\n- Since we cannot predict the identity of any amino acid in the resulting polypeptide (or even if one exists), we cannot assert a change for any residue.\n- Therefore, the number of residues for which a change can be unambiguously asserted is 0.\n\nThe loss of the start codon also implies the loss of the N-terminal signal peptide, which would prevent the protein from being secreted and likely abrogate its function, reinforcing the severity of the \"unknown\" prediction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "4343304"}]}
