## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the fundamental principles and syntax of the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature, we now shift our focus from theory to practice. A standardized language for describing genetic variation is not merely an academic exercise; it is the bedrock upon which the entire edifice of modern genomic medicine is built. Without a precise, unambiguous, and universally understood system for documenting variants, the sharing of clinical data, the aggregation of evidence, and the implementation of precision medicine would be impossible.

This chapter explores the application of HGVS nomenclature in a wide array of real-world and interdisciplinary contexts. We will demonstrate how the core principles are utilized to describe complex biological events, navigate the intricacies of the human genome, and interface with other critical domains such as cytogenetics, pharmacogenomics, and clinical informatics. By examining these applications, we will illuminate the indispensable role of HGVS nomenclature as the *lingua franca* of human genetics.

### Application in Clinical Variant Curation

The primary application of HGVS nomenclature is in the clinical laboratory, where variants detected in patients must be described with absolute clarity to enable accurate interpretation and diagnosis. This requires the system to be robust enough to handle the full spectrum of genetic variation and its consequences.

#### Describing Complex Protein Consequences

A variant's ultimate impact often lies in its effect on the protein product. HGVS nomenclature provides a precise framework for predicting and describing these consequences, which is a critical first step in assessing pathogenicity.

A frequent challenge is the annotation of variants that affect messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing. Variants that disrupt the canonical splice donor (`GT`) and acceptor (`AG`) sites at [intron](@entry_id:152563)-exon boundaries are a common cause of genetic disease. HGVS provides a clear method for describing these intronic variants relative to the adjacent [coding sequence](@entry_id:204828). For an exon ending at coding position `c.1005` and the next beginning at `c.1006`, the first two nucleotides of the intervening [intron](@entry_id:152563) (the canonical donor site) are designated `c.1005+1` and `c.1005+2`. Correspondingly, the last two nucleotides of the intron (the canonical acceptor site) are designated `c.1006-2` and `c.1006-1`. A substitution at the first base of the donor site would thus be written as `c.1005+1G>T`, providing an unambiguous description of its location relative to the coding sequence. [@problem_id:4343286]

The nomenclature is equally adept at describing the consequences of insertions and deletions (indels) at the protein level. For in-frame indels that do not shift the reading frame, the `p.` notation specifies the exact amino acids affected. An in-frame deletion of the residues from Glutamate at position 5 through Serine at position 7 is concisely described as `p.Glu5_Ser7del`. The underscore denotes an inclusive range. Conversely, an insertion of a Proline-Glycine dipeptide between Glycine at position 12 and Alanine at position 13 is written as `p.Gly12_Ala13insProGly`, specifying the two flanking residues that form the insertion site. [@problem_id:4343289]

When an indel does cause a frameshift, the consequences are typically more severe, often leading to a completely altered C-terminal [amino acid sequence](@entry_id:163755) and a premature termination codon. HGVS captures this complex event in a single, informative string. For example, a single nucleotide deletion, `c.100delA`, occurring within the codon for Lysine at position 34, would be described at the protein level as `p.(Lys34SerfsTer9)`. This notation conveys that the [reading frame](@entry_id:260995) is altered starting at codon 34, the first new amino acid is a Serine, and a new termination codon (`Ter`) is encountered at the 9th position in the new reading frame. The use of parentheses indicates that this is a predicted consequence based on the DNA sequence. [@problem_id:4343305]

HGVS also provides specific rules for variants that affect the translation [start and stop codons](@entry_id:146944). A substitution that converts a termination codon into one that codes for an amino acid results in a "stop-loss" and translation of the $3'$ untranslated region (UTR). This is described using the `ext` (extension) descriptor. If a [stop codon](@entry_id:261223) at position 327 is changed to a Glutamine codon, and a new [stop codon](@entry_id:261223) is found 21 codons downstream, the variant is described as `p.(Ter327Glnext*21)`. If the location of the new stop codon cannot be determined (e.g., due to an incomplete reference sequence), the format `p.(Ter327Glnext*?)` is used to denote the uncertainty. Similarly, the creation of a new [start codon](@entry_id:263740) upstream of the canonical one, resulting in an N-terminal extension of, for example, 12 amino acids, is described as `p.Met1ext-12`. [@problem_id:4343328]

#### Handling Allelic Complexity and Phasing

For recessive diseases, it is often critical to determine if two heterozygous variants are located on the same parental chromosome (in *cis*) or on opposite chromosomes (in *trans*). Only variants in *trans* can result in a compound heterozygous state that causes disease. HGVS nomenclature provides a clear syntax for documenting this phasing information. Multiple variants found on a single allele (a haplotype) are enclosed within a single set of square brackets and separated by a semicolon. The two alleles of a diploid genotype are then listed.

Consider a proband with cystic fibrosis who has three variants in the *CFTR* gene. If family studies reveal that a pathogenic deletion (`c.1521_1523del`) and a synonymous variant (`c.2562T>G`) were inherited together from the father, while a splice-site variant (`c.1585-1G>A`) was inherited from the mother, the proband's genotype is described unambiguously as `NM_000492.4:c.[1521_1523del; 2562T>G];[1585-1G>A]`. This notation makes it immediately clear that the two disease-causing variants (the deletion and the splice-site variant) are in *trans*, confirming a compound heterozygous state. Without phasing, there would be multiple possible configurations, but this notation resolves the ambiguity entirely. [@problem_id:4343239]

#### Addressing Transcript Diversity and Reporting Standards

A significant challenge in variant annotation is the existence of multiple transcript isoforms for a single gene due to [alternative splicing](@entry_id:142813). A single genomic variant can have dramatically different effects depending on which transcript is used as the reference. For instance, a genomic variant in *TP53* might be described as a missense change, `p.(Met125Ile)`, on one transcript, but as a synonymous change, `p.(=)`, on another transcript that uses a different exon structure.

To standardize clinical reporting and resolve this ambiguity, the Matched Annotation from NCBI and EBI (MANE) initiative has established the MANE Select transcript as the single, default transcript for clinical use for most human genes. Best practice in clinical reporting is to provide the variant description on the MANE Select transcript as the primary annotation, while optionally including descriptions for other clinically relevant transcripts as secondary information. A complete report must always specify the versioned transcript [accession number](@entry_id:165652) (e.g., `NM_000546.6`) to which the `c.` and `p.` notations refer. [@problem_id:4343262]

### Interdisciplinary Connections: Bridging Scales and Domains

The utility of HGVS extends beyond standard variant curation, providing a crucial link between the sequence-level detail of molecular genetics and the broader contexts of cytogenomics, specialized disease areas, and pharmacogenomics.

#### Connecting Sequence-Level and Cytogenomic Nomenclature

Genomic [structural variation](@entry_id:173359) is described by two major nomenclature systems: HGVS for sequence-resolved changes and the International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature (ISCN) for karyotype- and band-level changes. The choice of system is dictated by the resolution of the assay used.

-   **ISCN** is the language of cytogenetics and is used for findings from low-resolution assays like karyotyping (e.g., describing a balanced translocation like `t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)`) or from [microarray](@entry_id:270888) analyses where breakpoints are not precisely known.
-   **HGVS** is the language of sequencing and is used when base-pair resolution is achieved.

For a sequence-resolved intragenic deletion, HGVS is mandatory to convey the precise effect (e.g., `NC_000017.11:g.29534512_29541234del`), whereas ISCN would provide only a low-resolution location. Conversely, for a band-level translocation seen on a [karyotype](@entry_id:138931), an HGVS description is impossible without breakpoint sequencing. A comprehensive clinical report uses the appropriate nomenclature for each finding based on the evidence. [@problem_id:4343287]

HGVS is flexible enough to handle uncertainty in [structural variant](@entry_id:164220) breakpoints. For example, a multi-exon duplication detected by Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) may have breakpoints that are known to lie within flanking [introns](@entry_id:144362) but have not been sequenced. If a duplication affects exons flanked by intron 10 (between `c.900` and `c.901`) and intron 13 (between `c.1325` and `c.1326`), the uncertain breakpoints are denoted with parentheses: `NM_012345.6:c.(900+1_901-1)_(1325+1_1326-1)dup`. This format precisely communicates what is known (the duplicated exons) and what is not (the exact breakpoints). [@problem_id:4343284]

Furthermore, HGVS provides a powerful syntax for describing interchromosomal rearrangements at sequence-level resolution. An insertion of a segment from chromosome 5 into chromosome 11 can be described on the recipient chromosome's reference sequence by nesting the donor reference sequence and coordinates within the `ins` descriptor. For example: `NC_000011.10:g.118500123_118500124ins(NC_000005.10:g.150123456_150123789)`. This single description unambiguously captures the identity of both the recipient and donor sequence, the insertion site, the content of the inserted DNA, and its orientation, providing a sequence-level complement to an ISCN description like `ins(11;5)`. [@problem_id:4343317]

#### Nomenclature for Specialized Genomic Contexts

The principles of HGVS are adapted for unique parts of the human genome. The mitochondrial genome, a small circular molecule, has its own dedicated nomenclature. Variants are described using the `m.` prefix relative to the Revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS, `NC_012920.1`). The coordinate system is a simple linear count from `1` to `16,569`. For example, a substitution at position `8993` is written as `m.8993T>G`. This standardized system avoids ambiguity that could arise from using nuclear genomic `g.` notation on different `chrM` sequences found in various genome builds. [@problem_id:4343258]

HGVS also provides a standard for describing repeat expansion disorders, such as Huntington's disease. The pathogenic expansion of a `CAG` trinucleotide repeat in the *HTT* gene can be described by specifying the coordinates of the first repeat unit and the number of repeats in a given allele. If the first `CAG` unit spans `c.52_54`, an allele with 45 repeats would be described at the DNA level as `c.52_54(CAG)45`. At the protein level, this corresponds to an expanded polyglutamine tract, which can be described as `p.(Gln18[45])`, indicating a stretch of 45 glutamine residues starting at position 18. [@problem_id:4343318]

#### Application in Pharmacogenomics

In pharmacogenomics, gene function is often categorized using "star allele" nomenclature (e.g., `DPYD*2A`). A star allele is a haplotype, defined by one or more variants that confer a specific functional status (e.g., poor metabolizer). HGVS nomenclature is the foundation for defining these alleles. The `DPYD*2A` loss-of-function allele, for instance, is defined by the presence of a single splice-site variant, `c.1905+1G>A`, which is also cataloged in dbSNP as `rs3918290`. The star allele name serves as a functional summary, but its unambiguous definition rests on the underlying HGVS description of its constituent variant(s) on a specified reference transcript. This mapping is essential for accurately translating a patient's genetic data into a predicted drug-metabolizer phenotype. [@problem_id:4386168]

### Application in the Genomics Data Ecosystem

Standardized nomenclature is the engine of the modern genomics data ecosystem, enabling data sharing, evidence aggregation, and the development of interoperable health information technology.

#### Standardization in Public Data Repositories

Public databases like ClinVar are essential for aggregating evidence on variant pathogenicity from laboratories and researchers worldwide. For this resource to be effective, submissions must be interpretable and re-evaluable. A complete and interpretable ClinVar submission requires a minimal set of data elements: an unambiguous **variant** description (using HGVS), the **disease** context (e.g., an OMIM identifier), the clinical **significance** (e.g., "Pathogenic"), the assertion **method** (e.g., ACMG/AMP 2015 guidelines), and the supporting **evidence** (e.g., case data, population frequencies, functional studies). The HGVS description serves as the unique key that allows evidence from different submitters for the same variant to be correctly aggregated. [@problem_id:4327284]

#### Integration into Clinical Reports and Health Information Technology

Ultimately, a variant analysis culminates in a clinical report. A well-structured report uses precise HGVS nomenclature to describe the primary findings while adhering to laboratory policies and professional guidelines (e.g., from ACMG/AMP) regarding which variants to include. For a patient with Marfan syndrome, a report would feature the identified pathogenic *FBN1* variant with its full HGVS description, zygosity, and quality metrics. It would appropriately exclude [variants of uncertain significance](@entry_id:269401) (VUS) and incidental findings in other genes, as well as low-quality calls below the validated limit of detection, to avoid clinical confusion. The report must also contain a comprehensive summary of the assay's limitations, such as its inability to detect certain types of structural variants. [@problem_id:5134541]

The final frontier for HGVS application is its integration into a fully digital and interoperable healthcare system. To enable automated clinical decision support (CDS), genetic data must be machine-readable. This is achieved by encoding variants using HGVS within structured data formats like Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR). A properly structured FHIR `Observation` resource can capture the HGVS string, gene, and zygosity using standard terminologies (e.g., LOINC, SNOMED CT). This allows a downstream system to computably map the variant to a diplotype (e.g., `CYP2C19 *1/*2`), then to a phenotype (e.g., "Intermediate Metabolizer"), and finally trigger a CDS alert based on a clinical guideline (e.g., from CPIC), such as recommending an alternative to the drug clopidogrel. This seamless, automated chain of inference from genotype to clinical action is only possible because of the rigorous, systematic foundation provided by HGVS nomenclature. [@problem_id:4325429]

### Conclusion

As we have seen, the application of HGVS nomenclature extends far beyond the simple annotation of a DNA change. It is a vital tool for predicting protein function, clarifying complex [inheritance patterns](@entry_id:137802), bridging the gap between molecular and cytogenetic findings, and enabling specialized fields like pharmacogenomics. Most importantly, it serves as the foundational standard for sharing data in public repositories and for building the interoperable health information systems that are bringing the promise of precision medicine to clinical reality. The rigor and precision of HGVS are not constraints but enablers, providing the clarity and consistency required to advance both the science of genomics and the practice of medicine.
