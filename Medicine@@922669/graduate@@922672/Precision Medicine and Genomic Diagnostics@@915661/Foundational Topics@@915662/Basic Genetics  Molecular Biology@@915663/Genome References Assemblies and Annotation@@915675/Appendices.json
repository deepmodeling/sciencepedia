Two draft assemblies are available for the locus: a pre-polishing assembly and a post-polishing assembly. In this context, contiguity metrics such as $N50$ and $L50$ are used to summarize assembly continuity based on scaffold lengths. Use the standard definitions grounded in assembly contiguity: sort scaffold lengths in non-increasing order, let the total assembled length be $T$, and let $T/2$ be the half-length threshold. The $L50$ is the smallest number of top-ranked scaffolds whose cumulative length is at least $T/2$, and the $N50$ is the length of the scaffold at that $L50$-th rank.

It provides all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution. The concepts of genome assembly, contiguity, $N50$, and $L50$ are standard in genomics and bioinformatics.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts: first, we calculate the $N50$ and $L50$ metrics for the pre-polishing assembly; second, we do the same for the post-polishing assembly; and third, we compare the metrics, interpret the results, and compute the contiguity improvement index $R$.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of the Pre-polishing Assembly**\n\nThe provided scaffold lengths for the pre-polishing assembly are (in kilobases, kb): $590$, $710$, $350$, $300$, $400$, $950$, $600$, $150$, $720$, $250$, $480$, $880$, $520$, $380$, $200$. There are $n_{\\text{pre}} = 15$ scaffolds.\n\nFirst, we sort these lengths in non-increasing (descending) order:\n$950, 880, 720, 710, 600, 590, 520, 480, 400, 380, 350, 300, 250, 200, 150$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total assembled length, $T_{\\text{pre}}$:\n$$ T_{\\text{pre}} = 950 + 880 + 720 + 710 + 600 + 590 + 520 + 480 + 400 + 380 + 350 + 300 + 250 + 200 + 150 = 7480 \\text{ kb} $$\nThe half-length threshold is $T_{\\text{pre}}/2$:\n$$ \\frac{T_{\\text{pre}}}{2} = \\frac{7480}{2} = 3740 \\text{ kb} $$\nNow, we find the smallest number of scaffolds whose cumulative length is at least $3740$ kb. We compute the cumulative sum of the sorted lengths:\n1. $950$\n2. $950 + 880 = 1830$\n3. $1830 + 720 = 2550$\n4. $2550 + 710 = 3260$\n5. $3260 + 600 = 3860$\n\nThe cumulative sum first exceeds the threshold of $3740$ kb with the inclusion of the 5th scaffold. Therefore, the $L50$ for the pre-polishing assembly is:\n$$ L50_{\\text{pre}} = 5 $$\nThe $N50$ is the length of this 5th scaffold in the sorted list.\n$$ N50_{\\text{pre}} = 600 \\text{ kb} $$\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of the Post-polishing Assembly**\n\nThe provided scaffold lengths for the post-polishing assembly are (in kb): $500$, $400$, $250$, $1400$, $600$, $1000$, $900$, $450$, $200$, $350$, $800$, $300$. There are $n_{\\text{post}} = 12$ scaffolds.\n\nWe sort these lengths in non-increasing order:\n$1400, 1000, 900, 800, 600, 500, 450, 400, 350, 300, 250, 200$.\n\nThe total assembled length, $T_{\\text{post}}$, is:\n$$ T_{\\text{post}} = 1400 + 1000 + 900 + 800 + 600 + 500 + 450 + 400 + 350 + 300 + 250 + 200 = 7150 \\text{ kb} $$\nThe half-length threshold is $T_{\\text{post}}/2$:\n$$ \\frac{T_{\\text{post}}}{2} = \\frac{7150}{2} = 3575 \\text{ kb} $$\nWe compute the cumulative sum of the sorted lengths to find the $L50$:\n1. $1400$\n2. $1400 + 1000 = 2400$\n3. $2400 + 900 = 3300$\n4. $3300 + 800 = 4100$\n\nThe cumulative sum first exceeds the threshold of $3575$ kb with the inclusion of the 4th scaffold. Thus, the $L50$ for the post-polishing assembly is:\n$$ L50_{\\text{post}} = 4 $$\nThe $N50$ is the length of this 4th scaffold.\n$$ N50_{\\text{post}} = 800 \\text{ kb} $$\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation and Calculation of $R$**\n\nWe summarize the computed metrics:\n- Pre-polishing: $L50_{\\text{pre}} = 5$, $N50_{\\text{pre}} = 600$ kb.\n- Post-polishing: $L50_{\\text{post}} = 4$, $N50_{\\text{post}} = 800$ kb.\n\nImprovement in assembly contiguity is indicated by a higher $N50$ value and a lower $L50$ value. The $N50$ increased from $600$ kb to $800$ kb, and the $L50$ decreased from $5$ to $4$. Both changes signify that the post-polishing assembly is more continuous (less fragmented) than the pre-polishing one. A higher $N50$ means that half of the assembly is contained in scaffolds of at least $800$ kb, a significant improvement. A lower $L50$ means fewer scaffolds are needed to cover that same half, indicating that the scaffolds are, on average, longer. This suggests the polishing process successfully joined previously separate scaffolds.\n\nHowever, for a clinical-grade assembly, contiguity is not the only measure of quality. The term \"polishing\" implies the correction of base-level errors (e.g., single nucleotide variants and small indels), which improves sequence accuracy. These contiguity metrics do not measure base accuracy. Furthermore, joining scaffolds might introduce new, larger-scale structural errors (misassemblies), which could be detrimental to variant interpretation in oncology. Also, the total assembly length decreased from $7480$ kb to $7150$ kb, which would require further investigation to ensure no critical genomic regions were lost. Therefore, while the metrics suggest an improvement in contiguity, a full validation of a clinical-grade assembly would require orthogonal methods to assess base accuracy, structural correctness, and completeness.\n\nFinally, we calculate the dimensionless contiguity improvement index $R$:\n$$ R \\equiv \\left(\\frac{N50_{\\text{post}}}{N50_{\\text{pre}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{L50_{\\text{pre}}}{L50_{\\text{post}}}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$ R = \\left(\\frac{800}{600}\\right)\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right) = \\frac{20}{12} = \\frac{5}{3} $$\nAs a decimal, $R = 1.6666...$.

This exercise simulates a real-world bioinformatics challenge: normalizing a variant description to a consistent, \"left-aligned\" representation and then mapping its coordinates from the transcript level ($c.$) to the genomic level ($g.$) [@problem_id:4346162]. Mastering this process is crucial for building robust variant annotation pipelines that can interpret data from different sources reliably.", "problem": "A clinical variant interpretation pipeline must interconvert transcript-level Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) coding DNA sequence (c.) descriptions and genome-level (g.) coordinates on the Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 38 (GRCh38). The pipeline uses a normalization policy that resolves insertions occurring within short tandem repeats to the leftmost equivalent representation on the transcript sequence and, when the inserted sequence is identical to adjacent reference sequence, prefers a duplication (“dup”) description over an insertion (“ins”). This policy is chosen to harmonize with left-aligned normalization used in certain variant catalogs, even though the canonical HGVS “most 3′” rule differs; you must follow the stated policy in this problem.\n\nConsider a gene located on chromosome $5$ in GRCh38 on the forward strand. Its coding sequence (CDS) starts at the first base of exon $1$, so that the HGVS coding position $c.1$ is the first nucleotide of exon $1$. The gene has three exons:\n\n- Exon $1$: genomic coordinates $g = 1{,}000{,}100$ to $1{,}000{,}199$ (inclusive), length $L_1 = 100$.\n- Exon $2$: genomic coordinates $g = 1{,}001{,}000$ to $1{,}001{,}149$ (inclusive), length $L_2 = 150$.\n- Exon $3$: genomic coordinates $g = 1{,}002{,}000$ to $1{,}002{,}199$ (inclusive), length $L_3 = 200$.\n\nSplicing is canonical: the transcript is the concatenation of the exons in order, with no intronic sequence. Because $c.1$ is the first base of exon $1$, the HGVS coding positions span exon $1$ as $c.1$ through $c.100$, exon $2$ as $c.101$ through $c.250$, and exon $3$ as $c.251$ through $c.450$.\n\nWithin exon $2$, the first $12$ nucleotides of the exon (which correspond to transcript positions $c.101$ through $c.112$) are a repeated trinucleotide motif:\n$$\n\\text{exon 2 bases 1--12} = \\texttt{ATCATCATCATC}\n$$\nwhere bases $1$–$3$ of exon $2$ (i.e., positions $c.101$–$c.103$) are $\\texttt{ATC}$, bases $4$–$6$ (positions $c.104$–$c.106$) are $\\texttt{ATC}$, bases $7$–$9$ (positions $c.107$–$c.109$) are $\\texttt{ATC}$, and bases $10$–$12$ (positions $c.110$–$c.112$) are $\\texttt{ATC}$.\n\nA variant is initially described on the transcript as:\n$$\nc.110\\_111\\text{ins}\\,\\texttt{ATC}.\n$$\n\nUsing only the following foundational bases and rules:\n- Definition of HGVS coding sequence positions: $c.1$ is the first nucleotide of the CDS on the transcript; coding positions increase by $1$ along the $5'$ to $3'$ direction of the transcript.\n- The transcript sequence is the ordered concatenation of exons, with introns removed.\n- On the forward strand, the mapping from a coding position $c.n$ that lies within exon $i$ to a genomic coordinate $g$ is computed by adding to the exon’s genomic start the zero-based offset of $c.n$ within that exon.\n- The normalization policy in this problem: when an insertion occurs within a repeated motif and the inserted sequence equals the repeat unit, represent it as a duplication of the leftmost equivalent repeat unit on the transcript (i.e., choose the smallest $c.$ coordinates consistent with equivalence).\n\nDerive, from first principles, the leftmost normalized HGVS coding description for this event and then compute the genome-level duplication coordinates on GRCh38.

Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) coding sequence positions are defined such that $c.1$ is the first nucleotide of the coding sequence (CDS) on the transcript, and positions increase along the $5'$ to $3'$ direction. For a gene on the forward strand, the transcript is formed by concatenating exons in genomic order, and there is a direct mapping from a coding position within an exon to a genomic coordinate by adding the position’s offset within that exon to the exon’s genomic start.\n\nGiven three exons with lengths $L_1 = 100$, $L_2 = 150$, and $L_3 = 200$, and with $c.1$ at the first base of exon $1$, the coding position ranges are:\n- Exon $1$: $c.1$ through $c.100$.\n- Exon $2$: $c.101$ through $c.250$.\n- Exon $3$: $c.251$ through $c.450$.\n\nThe first $12$ bases of exon $2$ are `ATCATCATCATC`, which can be partitioned into four consecutive `ATC` units:\n- Exon $2$ base $1$ ($c.101$) to base $3$ ($c.103$): `ATC`.\n- Exon $2$ base $4$ ($c.104$) to base $6$ ($c.106$): `ATC`.\n- Exon $2$ base $7$ ($c.107$) to base $9$ ($c.109$): `ATC`.\n- Exon $2$ base $10$ ($c.110$) to base $12$ ($c.112$): `ATC`.\n\nThe original variant description is `c.110_111insATC`, indicating insertion of the trinucleotide `ATC` between positions $c.110$ and $c.111$. Because the local sequence is a repeated motif of `ATC`, the inserted sequence equals the repeat unit that occurs immediately adjacent across multiple positions. Under the normalization policy specified for this problem, we must:\n1. Recognize that inserting `ATC` within a run of `ATC` repeats is equivalent to duplicating one of the existing `ATC` units.\n2. Choose the leftmost equivalent unit on the transcript to represent the event as a duplication (i.e., we should minimize the $c.$ interval).\n\nAmong the four `ATC` units spanning $c.101$–$c.103$, $c.104$–$c.106$, $c.107$–$c.109$, and $c.110$–$c.112$, the leftmost unit is the first one: $c.101$–$c.103$. Therefore, the normalized coding DNA description under the stated policy is:\n$$\nc.101\\_103\\text{dup}.\n$$\n\nWe now compute the genome-level (g.) coordinates of this duplication on GRCh38. The gene is on the forward strand, so mapping from $c.n$ to $g$ within an exon is a simple offset from the exon’s genomic start. Let the genomic start of exon $i$ be $G_i$ and its end be $H_i$, and let $c.n$ lie in exon $i$. Define the cumulative coding length before exon $i$ as $S_{i-1} = \\sum_{k=1}^{i-1} L_k$. The zero-based offset of $c.n$ within exon $i$ is $\\Delta = (n - S_{i-1}) - 1$. Then the genomic coordinate is $g = G_i + \\Delta$.\n\nFor our duplication interval $c.101$–$c.103$, both positions lie in exon $2$. We have $G_2 = 1{,}001{,}000$ and $S_{1} = L_1 = 100$. Compute offsets:\n- For $c.101$: $n = 101$, so $\\Delta = (101 - 100) - 1 = 0$. Hence $g = 1{,}001{,}000 + 0 = 1{,}001{,}000$.\n- For $c.103$: $n = 103$, so $\\Delta = (103 - 100) - 1 = 2$. Hence $g = 1{,}001{,}000 + 2 = 1{,}001{,}002$.\n\nThus, the genome-level duplication interval is `g.1001000_1001002dup`. The problem requests the genomic coordinate of the first base of the normalized duplication event (i.e., the lower genomic index).

We must determine their configuration (cis/trans) from both the truth and observed data and comment on the clinical impact.\n\nThe terms `in cis` and `in trans` refer to the relative positions of two alleles on homologous chromosomes.\n-   **In cis**: Both alleles are on the same chromosome copy (e.g., both on the paternal chromosome or both on the maternal chromosome).\n-   **In trans**: The alleles are on different chromosome copies (e.g., one on the paternal, one on the maternal).\n\n**Ground-Truth Configuration:**\n-   For variant $i=3$, the alternate allele is on the maternal haplotype: $T_3 = M$.\n-   For variant $i=8$, the alternate allele is on the paternal haplotype: $T_8 = P$.\nSince the two pathogenic alternate alleles are on different parental haplotypes ($M$ and $P$), they are, in reality, **in trans**.\n\n**Observed Configuration:**\n-   For variant $i=3$, the alternate allele is assigned to haplotype label $H_2$: $O_3 = H_2$.\n-   For variant $i=8$, the alternate allele is also assigned to haplotype label $H_2$: $O_8 = H_2$.\nSince the observed phasing places both pathogenic alternate alleles on the same haplotype label ($H_2$), they are observed to be **in cis**.\n\n**Clinical Impact:**\nThe discrepancy between the true `in trans` configuration and the observed `in cis` configuration represents a critical phasing error with significant clinical consequences.\n\nFor an autosomal recessive disorder, disease manifestation typically requires two defective copies of the gene.\n-   The true **in trans** configuration signifies compound heterozygosity. The patient has one pathogenic allele on the maternal chromosome and a second on the paternal chromosome. This means the patient lacks a fully functional copy of the gene, which is the genetic basis for the autosomal recessive disease. The correct clinical interpretation is that the patient is **affected** by the disorder.\n-   The incorrectly observed **in cis** configuration suggests that both pathogenic alleles reside on one chromosome copy (represented by label $H_2$), while the other chromosome copy (represented by label $H_1$) is, at these positions, wild-type. A clinician interpreting this result would likely conclude that the patient possesses one fully functional copy of the gene and is merely a **carrier** of two linked pathogenic variants. This would lead to a false-negative finding—a missed diagnosis—potentially withholding necessary treatment or genetic counseling. This highlights the absolute necessity of accurate haplotype phasing for correct interpretation in precision medicine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2222}$$", "id": "4346101"}]}
