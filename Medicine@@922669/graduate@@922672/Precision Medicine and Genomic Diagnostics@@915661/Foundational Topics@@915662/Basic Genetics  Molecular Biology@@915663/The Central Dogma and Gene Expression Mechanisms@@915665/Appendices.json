To quantify predicted protein-level consequences in a strand-aware, codon-degenerate framework, consider the following scientifically consistent setup based on the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) on the coding (sense) strand contains the triplet CAG, which is transcribed to Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) as CAG (with thymine replaced by uracil in RNA, but for this exercise use DNA alphabet to keep codon identities comparable), and translated according to the standard nuclear genetic code. Assume a single nucleotide variant is a substitution of exactly one base in the triplet to any of the other three canonical deoxyribonucleotides (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine). Variants may be reported on either the coding strand or the template (antisense) strand, but translation is determined by the mRNA derived from the coding strand. Treat translation termination (a stop codon) as a distinct outcome class alongside amino acids. Ignore all context effects beyond the triplet (for example, initiation context, splicing, RNA editing, and post-translational modification), and assume the reading frame is fixed.\n\nStarting from these fundamental principles (codon-to-amino acid mapping under the standard genetic code and Watson–Crick base pairing), derive the number of distinct translated outcomes reachable by any single-base substitution at the first, second, or third position of the codon CAG. Distinct outcomes are counted by unique amino acid identities or the stop signal, not by unique codons per se. Your final answer should be a row matrix with three entries $n_1$, $n_2$, and $n_3$, where $n_1$ is the number of distinct outcomes for variants at position $1$, $n_2$ for position $2$, and $n_3$ for position $3$ of the codon. Express the final answer as a row matrix and do not include units. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the number of distinct translated outcomes resulting from single nucleotide variants (SNVs) at each of the three positions of the codon `$\\text{CAG}$`. The analysis is based on the principles of the central dogma, including DNA complementarity, transcription, and translation according to the standard nuclear genetic code.\n\nFirst, we establish the initial state. The coding (sense) strand of DNA contains the triplet `5'-CAG-3'`. According to the standard genetic code, this codon is transcribed into the messenger RNA (mRNA) codon `5'-CAG-3'` (using the deoxyribonucleotide `$\\text{T}$` in place of `$\\text{U}$` for thymine and uracil, as permitted by the problem statement). This mRNA codon translates to the amino acid Glutamine, abbreviated as `$\\text{Gln}$` or `$\\text{Q}$`.\n\nThe template (antisense) strand is complementary to the coding strand. Following Watson-Crick base pairing rules (`$\\text{A}$` pairs with `$\\text{T}$`; `$\\text{C}$` pairs with `$\\text{G}$`), the template strand corresponding to `5'-CAG-3'` is `3'-GTC-5'`.\n\nThe problem specifies that variants may be reported on either the coding or the template strand. We must analyze the implications of this. A single nucleotide substitution at a given position in the DNA double helix can be viewed as a change in one of the two bases of a base pair. For example, at position $1$, the base pair is `$\\text{C:G}$` (coding:template). A substitution on the coding strand might be `$\\text{C} \\to \\text{A}$`. This changes the codon to `$\\text{AAG}$`. For this to be a stable change, the corresponding template base must change from `$\\text{G}$` to `$\\text{T}$`. This exact same outcome (`$\\text{AAG}$` codon) is achieved if the mutation is considered to have occurred on the template strand as `$\\text{G} \\to \\text{T}$`. In general, for any base `$\\text{N}$` on the coding strand, the set of three possible substitutions `$\\{\\text{N}_1, \\text{N}_2, \\text{N}_3\\}$` is equivalent to the set of substitutions on the complementary template base `$\\text{N'}$` that result in `$\\{\\text{N}_1, \\text{N}_2, \\text{N}_3\\}$` appearing on the coding strand. Thus, enumerating the three possible substitutions on the coding strand for each position is sufficient to account for all possible single-base substitution outcomes.\n\nLet $n_1$, $n_2$, and $n_3$ be the number of distinct translated outcomes for SNVs at position $1$, $2$, and $3$ of the codon `$\\text{CAG}$`, respectively. A distinct outcome is a unique amino acid or a stop signal.\n\n**Analysis for Position 1 ($n_1$):**\nThe original codon is `$\\text{CAG}$` (`$\\text{Gln}$`). The first base is `$\\text{C}$`. The three possible substitutions are to `$\\text{A}$`, `$\\text{G}$`, or `$\\text{T}$`.\n1.  Substitution `$\\text{C} \\to \\text{A}$`: The resulting codon is `$\\text{AAG}$`. `$\\text{AAG}$` translates to Lysine (`$\\text{Lys}$`).\n2.  Substitution `$\\text{C} \\to \\text{G}$`: The resulting codon is `$\\text{GAG}$`. `$\\text{GAG}$` translates to Glutamic Acid (`$\\text{Glu}$`).\n3.  Substitution `$\\text{C} \\to \\text{T}$`: The resulting codon is `$\\text{TAG}$`. `$\\text{TAG}$` is a stop codon (`$\\text{STOP}$`).\nThe set of distinct translated outcomes is `$\\{\\text{Lys}, \\text{Glu}, \\text{STOP}\\}$`. The number of distinct outcomes is $3$.\nTherefore, $n_1 = 3$.\n\n**Analysis for Position 2 ($n_2$):**\nThe original codon is `$\\text{CAG}$` (`$\\text{Gln}$`). The second base is `$\\text{A}$`. The three possible substitutions are to `$\\text{C}$`, `$\\text{G}$`, or `$\\text{T}$`.\n1.  Substitution `$\\text{A} \\to \\text{C}$`: The resulting codon is `$\\text{CCG}$`. `$\\text{CCG}$` translates to Proline (`$\\text{Pro}$`).\n2.  Substitution `$\\text{A} \\to \\text{G}$`: The resulting codon is `$\\text{CGG}$`. `$\\text{CGG}$` translates to Arginine (`$\\text{Arg}$`).\n3.  Substitution `$\\text{A} \\to \\text{T}$`: The resulting codon is `$\\text{CTG}$`. `$\\text{CTG}$` translates to Leucine (`$\\text{Leu}$`).\nThe set of distinct translated outcomes is `$\\{\\text{Pro}, \\text{Arg}, \\text{Leu}\\}$`. The number of distinct outcomes is $3$.\nTherefore, $n_2 = 3$.\n\n**Analysis for Position 3 ($n_3$):**\nThe original codon is `$\\text{CAG}$` (`$\\text{Gln}$`). The third base is `$\\text{G}$`. The three possible substitutions are to `$\\text{A}$`, `$\\text{C}$`, or `$\\text{T}$`.\n1.  Substitution `$\\text{G} \\to \\text{A}$`: The resulting codon is `$\\text{CAA}$`. `$\\text{CAA}$` translates to Glutamine (`$\\text{Gln}$`), which is a synonymous substitution.\n2.  Substitution `$\\text{G} \\to \\text{C}$`: The resulting codon is `$\\text{CAC}$`. `$\\text{CAC}$` translates to Histidine (`$\\text{His}$`).\n3.  Substitution `$\\text{G} \\to \\text{T}$`: The resulting codon is `$\\text{CAT}$`. `$\\text{CAT}$` also translates to Histidine (`$\\text{His}$`).\nThe set of distinct translated outcomes is `$\\{\\text{Gln}, \\text{His}\\}$`. The number of distinct outcomes is $2$.\nTherefore, $n_3 = 2$.\n\nCombining the results, the number of distinct translated outcomes for single-base substitutions at positions $1$, $2$, and $3$ are $3$, $3$, and $2$, respectively.
