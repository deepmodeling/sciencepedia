In principle, the number of reads mapping to a genomic region is directly proportional to the underlying copy number of that DNA segment. This exercise [@problem_id:4350932] guides you through deriving this core relationship from first principles, using a standard Poisson statistical model to connect observed read counts to copy number states like heterozygous deletions ($C=1$) and duplications ($C=3$).", "problem": "In copy-number variant (CNV) detection from whole-genome sequencing in precision medicine, read depth across genomic windows is commonly modeled using a homogeneous Poisson process after correcting for sample-specific and locus-specific biases (for example, library size and guanine-cytosine content). Consider a genome sequenced with total reads distributed uniformly across the reference. Let the number of mapped reads in a fixed window of size $w$ be modeled as a Poisson random variable under a homogeneous intensity per base. Assume the following:\n\n- Uniform random sampling of fragments across the genome and independent read placements, consistent with the Lander–Waterman framework.\n- The mapped read count in a window is approximately Poisson with mean proportional to the underlying template abundance, which scales linearly with germline copy number $C$.\n- All correction factors (for example, guanine-cytosine bias, mappability) have been applied so that the baseline intensity for a diploid region (copy number $C=2$) is homogeneous and identical across the genome.\n- Define the normalized depth in a window as the observed read count divided by the expected read count for a diploid copy number ($C=2$) in that same window.\n\nStarting from these principles, derive the relationship between the Poisson mean for read counts and copy number $C$, and then derive the expected normalized depth as a function of $C$. Finally, compute the expected normalized depth for $C=1$, $C=2$, and $C=3$ under a diploid baseline.

All necessary information is provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The premises are based on established statistical models used in genomic analysis. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages as requested: deriving the relationship between the Poisson mean and copy number $C$, deriving the expected normalized depth as a function of $C$, and computing this value for specific copy numbers.\n\nLet $N_C$ be the random variable representing the number of mapped reads in a fixed genomic window for a region with an underlying germline copy number $C$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, $N_C$ follows a Poisson distribution. The parameter of a Poisson distribution is its mean, denoted by $\\lambda_C$.\n$$N_C \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_C)$$\nwhere $\\lambda_C = E[N_C]$.\n\nThe problem states that the mean of the read count, $\\lambda_C$, is proportional to the copy number $C$. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$\\lambda_C \\propto C$$\nThis implies the existence of a constant of proportionality, $k$, such that:\n$$\\lambda_C = kC$$\nThe constant $k$ encapsulates all other factors that influence read depth, such as window size, sequencing library size, and sequencing efficiency, which are assumed to be constant across the genome after correction.\n\nNext, we use the provided baseline condition to determine the structure of this relationship. The problem specifies that for a normal diploid region, the copy number is $C=2$. Let the expected read count for this diploid state be $\\lambda_2$. Using our relationship:\n$$\\lambda_2 = k \\times 2$$\nWe can express the constant of proportionality $k$ in terms of the baseline diploid mean $\\lambda_2$:\n$$k = \\frac{\\lambda_2}{2}$$\nSubstituting this back into the general equation for $\\lambda_C$, we establish the explicit relationship between the Poisson mean for any copy number $C$ and the baseline diploid mean $\\lambda_2$:\n$$\\lambda_C = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_2}{2}\\right) C = \\lambda_2 \\frac{C}{2}$$\nThis is the required relationship between the Poisson mean for read counts and the copy number $C$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the derivation of the expected normalized depth. The normalized depth, let's call it $D_{norm}$, is defined as the observed read count divided by the expected read count for a diploid copy number ($C=2$).\nThe observed read count for a region with copy number $C$ is the random variable $N_C$.\nThe expected read count for a diploid copy number ($C=2$) is $E[N_2] = \\lambda_2$.\nTherefore, the normalized depth for a region of copy number $C$ is also a random variable, defined as:\n$$D_{norm} = \\frac{N_C}{\\lambda_2}$$\nWe are asked to find the expected normalized depth, $E[D_{norm}]$. We take the expectation of the expression above:\n$$E[D_{norm}] = E\\left[\\frac{N_C}{\\lambda_2}\\right]$$\nSince $\\lambda_2$ is a constant (the expected value for the reference state), it can be factored out of the expectation operator:\n$$E[D_{norm}] = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_2} E[N_C]$$\nThe expected value of the read count $N_C$ is, by definition, its Poisson mean $\\lambda_C$.

Substituting this into the equation for $E[D_{norm}]$:\n$$E[D_{norm}] = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_2} \\left(\\lambda_2 \\frac{C}{2}\\right)$$\nThe term $\\lambda_2$ cancels out, yielding the final relationship for the expected normalized depth as a function of copy number $C$:\n$$E[D_{norm}] = \\frac{C}{2}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the expected normalized depth for the specific cases of $C=1$, $C=2$, and $C=3$.\nFor a heterozygous deletion ($C=1$):\n$$E[D_{norm}] = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nFor a normal diploid region ($C=2$):\n$$E[D_{norm}] = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$$\nThis result is self-consistent, as the normalized depth for the baseline state is expected to be $1$.\nFor a single-copy duplication ($C=3$):\n$$E[D_{norm}] = \\frac{3}{2}$$\n\nThe final answer is the row vector of these three values, presented as exact fractions.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{2} & 1 & \\frac{3}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n} $$", "id": "4350932"}, {"introduction": "While read depth helps quantify large variants, the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) relies on the variant allele fraction (VAF).

It presents a standard, albeit simplified, model of biases in next-generation sequencing, which is a common task in genomic data analysis. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution will be derived from the stated principles.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Expected Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) under Ideal Conditions**\n\nThe problem states that for a heterozygous locus on a diploid autosome, the two alleles (reference and alternate) are present in equal copy number. The first principles given state that under unbiased sampling, a randomly sequenced DNA fragment originates from either allele with a probability of $0.5$.\n\nThe Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) is defined as the fraction of sequencing reads that support the alternate allele out of the total reads covering the locus. In an ideal, unbiased scenario, there are no systematic deviations. Therefore, the expected observed fraction of reads from an allele equals the underlying per-fragment probability for that allele.\n\nLet $P(A)$ be the probability of sampling a fragment containing the alternate allele, and $P(R)$ be the probability of sampling a fragment containing the reference allele. Based on the problem's principles:\n$$P(A) = 0.5$$\n$$P(R) = 0.5$$\nThe expected VAF, denoted $E[VAF]$, is the expected proportion of alternate allele reads. Under ideal conditions, this is simply $P(A)$.\n$$E[VAF]_{ideal} = P(A) = 0.5$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of VAF with Biases**\n\nWe now derive a closed-form expression for the expected observed VAF, $VAF_{obs}$, accounting for the specified multiplicative biases and a symmetric base-calling error. Let us model the process step-by-step, starting from the initial genomic proportions.\n\nThe initial proportion of reference ($p_R$) and alternate ($p_A$) alleles in the genomic DNA is $1:1$. Thus, the initial probabilities are $p_R = 0.5$ and $p_A = 0.5$.\n\nThe problem describes three sequential multiplicative biases that affect the relative abundance of reference and alternate reads prior to the base-calling step:\n1.  **Allelic Capture Bias:** Reference-allele molecules are weighted by a factor of $b$ relative to alternate-allele molecules (which have a weight of $1$).\n2.  **PCR Duplication Inflation:** The number of reads is scaled by factors $g_r$ and $g_a$ for reference and alternate alleles, respectively.\n3.  **Mapping Retention:** Reads are retained with probabilities $t_r$ and $t_a$ for reference and alternate alleles, respectively.\n\nSince all these biases are multiplicative, we can combine them into a single composite weight for each allele. Let $w_R$ be the composite weight for the reference allele and $w_A$ be the composite weight for the alternate allele.\n\nThe weight for the reference allele combines the initial proportion, capture bias, PCR inflation, and mapping retention:\n$$w_R \\propto p_R \\times b \\times g_r \\times t_r = 0.5 \\times b \\times g_r \\times t_r$$\nThe weight for the alternate allele is computed similarly:\n$$w_A \\propto p_A \\times 1 \\times g_a \\times t_a = 0.5 \\times 1 \\times g_a \\times t_a$$\n\nThe expected fraction of mapped reads that are truly from the alternate allele, which we shall call the true VAF ($VAF_{true}$), is the ratio of the alternate allele's composite weight to the sum of both weights. The common factor of $0.5$ cancels out.\n$$VAF_{true} = \\frac{w_A}{w_R + w_A} = \\frac{0.5 \\cdot g_a t_a}{0.5 \\cdot b g_r t_r + 0.5 \\cdot g_a t_a} = \\frac{g_a t_a}{b g_r t_r + g_a t_a}$$\nThe expected fraction of mapped reads that are truly from the reference allele is therefore:\n$$1 - VAF_{true} = \\frac{b g_r t_r}{b g_r t_r + g_a t_a}$$\n\nFinally, we introduce the symmetric base-calling error rate, $\\epsilon$. An observed alternate allele read can be either a true alternate read that was correctly called (with probability $1-\\epsilon$) or a true reference read that was incorrectly called as alternate (with probability $\\epsilon$).\n\nThe expected observed VAF, $VAF_{obs}$, is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events, weighted by the true allele fractions:\n$$VAF_{obs} = (VAF_{true} \\times P(\\text{call A}|\\text{true A})) + ((1 - VAF_{true}) \\times P(\\text{call A}|\\text{true R}))$$\nSubstituting the probabilities for the error model:\n$$VAF_{obs} = VAF_{true} \\cdot (1 - \\epsilon) + (1 - VAF_{true}) \\cdot \\epsilon$$\nThis expression can be simplified:\n$$VAF_{obs} = VAF_{true} - \\epsilon \\cdot VAF_{true} + \\epsilon - \\epsilon \\cdot VAF_{true}$$\n$$VAF_{obs} = VAF_{true} \\cdot (1 - 2\\epsilon) + \\epsilon$$\n\nSubstituting the derived expression for $VAF_{true}$ yields the final closed-form expression for the expected observed VAF:\n$$VAF_{obs} = \\left( \\frac{g_a t_a}{b g_r t_r + g_a t_a} \\right) (1 - 2\\epsilon) + \\epsilon$$\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation for Given Parameters**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the derived expression for the following parameter values:\n$b = 1.1$\n$g_r = 1.25$\n$g_a = 1.15$\n$t_r = 0.98$\n$t_a = 0.95$\n$\\epsilon = 0.005$\n\nFirst, we calculate the combined weight terms in the expression for $VAF_{true}$.\nThe numerator term (alternate allele path) is:\n$$g_a t_a = 1.15 \\times 0.95 = 1.0925$$\nThe reference allele path term in the denominator is:\n$$b g_r t_r = 1.1 \\times 1.25 \\times 0.98 = 1.3475$$\nNow, we calculate $VAF_{true}$:\n$$VAF_{true} = \\frac{1.0925}{1.3475 + 1.0925} = \\frac{1.0925}{2.44} \\approx 0.4477459$$\nNext, we calculate the term related to the sequencing error:\n$$1 - 2\\epsilon = 1 - 2(0.005) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$$\nFinally, we substitute these values into the expression for $VAF_{obs}$:\n$$VAF_{obs} = VAF_{true} \\cdot (1 - 2\\epsilon) + \\epsilon$$\n$$VAF_{obs} \\approx (0.4477459) \\times (0.99) + 0.005$$\n$$VAF_{obs} \\approx 0.44326844 + 0.005$$\n$$VAF_{obs} \\approx 0.44826844$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested, we obtain $0.4483$.\n\nThe final results for all three parts are:\n1.

The event carries a high risk of polymerase slippage artifact given the homopolymer context, strand bias, and the drop from raw VAF $0.20$ to deduplicated VAF $0.10$. Because the expected clonal VAF at $50\\%$ tumor purity is $\\approx 0.25$, the observed $0.10$ is inconsistent with a clonal heterozygous variant and may reflect subclonality or artifact. Sanger sequencing is near or below its detection sensitivity at $0.10$ and a negative result would be non-informative. Prefer orthogonal validation with a duplex Unique Molecular Identifier (true Duplex Sequencing) or an independent PCR-free capture-based assay with duplex error suppression; if confirmed, report as a subclonal indel, otherwise filter as likely artifact.\n\nB. The event is almost certainly a true somatic indel because $k = 120$ reads support it; accept and report without validation. The homopolymer context and strand bias do not meaningfully affect confidence once $k \\ge 100$.\n\nC. The observation is most consistent with a Copy Number Variation (CNV) rather than an indel; the appropriate orthogonal validation is array comparative genomic hybridization, because indels in homopolymers cannot be validated by sequence-based methods.\n\nD. The homopolymer context invalidates both short-read and Sanger sequencing; long-read single-molecule nanopore sequencing alone can confirm $-1$ base pair events in $A_8$ tracts at $0.10$ VAF, and Duplex Sequencing is not suitable for homopolymer-associated indels.\n\nE.

The provided data and principles are all standard in the field. It presents a classic, non-trivial case of variant calling that requires careful interpretation of multiple lines of evidence. It is a valid problem.\n\n3.  **Solution Derivation**:\n    *   I need to synthesize all the information to form a coherent interpretation.\n    *   **Interpretation of Evidence**:\n        *   **Homopolymer Context**: The $A_8$ tract is a major red flag. Homopolymers are notorious for polymerase slippage errors, which manifest as insertions or deletions. The longer the homopolymer, the higher the error rate.\n        *   **Read-Level vs. UMI-Level VAF**: The raw VAF is $0.20$. After UMI deduplication, the VAF drops to $0.10$. This drop is significant. The ratio of raw reads to unique molecules for the variant is $120/8 = 15$. For the reference, it's $(600-120)/(80-8) = 480/72 \\approx 6.67$. The disproportionately large \"family size\" for the variant molecules ($15$) compared to the reference molecules ($\\approx 6.67$) is a classic sign of PCR jackpotting, where an error in an early PCR cycle is amplified extensively. The problem statement explicitly mentions this possibility due to the two-step PCR design where UMIs are added late. This strongly suggests the variant signal is inflated by PCR artifact.\n        *   **Strand Bias**: A significant strand bias ($p \\approx 10^{-3}$), with $7$ out of $8$ supporting unique molecules on the same strand, is another major red flag for a systematic artifact. True biological variants are generally expected to be represented on both forward and reverse strands, although some biological and technical phenomena can cause bias. However, in combination with the homopolymer context and VAF drop, it heavily points towards a sequencing or library prep artifact.\n        *   **Comparison to Expected VAF**: The tumor purity is $50\\%$. For a clonal, heterozygous, diploid somatic variant, the expected VAF is $0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.25$. The observed deduplicated VAF is $0.10$. This is substantially lower. While this could mean the variant is subclonal (i.e., present in only a fraction of the tumor cells), it could also be consistent with a low-level artifact that appears to be at $10\\%$ VAF. The discrepancy between $0.10$ and $0.25$ further weakens the case for it being a simple clonal variant, but doesn't rule out subclonality.\n        *   **Matched Normal**: The absence of the variant in the matched normal ($k_N=0$ out of $n_N=500$ reads) confirms it is not a common germline variant. It is either a somatic variant or a recurring artifact specific to the tumor sample processing (which is unlikely to be perfectly absent in the normal if it's a pure sequencing chemistry artifact, but could be related to DNA quality or something specific to the tumor block).\n    *   **Summary of Interpretation**: Multiple lines of evidence (homopolymer context, VAF drop upon deduplication, large variant family size, significant strand bias) point towards this being a high-risk call, very likely an artifact. The deduplicated VAF of $0.10$ is at a level where it could be a true subclonal variant, but the artifactual evidence is overwhelming. Therefore, it requires stringent orthogonal validation.\n\n4.  **Option-by-Option Analysis**:\n    *   **Option A**:\n        *   \"The event carries a high risk of polymerase slippage artifact given the homopolymer context, strand bias, and the drop from raw VAF $0.20$ to deduplicated VAF $0.10$.\" - This is a correct assessment based on my analysis.\n        *   \"Because the expected clonal VAF at $50\\%$ tumor purity is $\\approx 0.25$, the observed $0.10$ is inconsistent with a clonal heterozygous variant and may reflect subclonality or artifact.\" - This is also a correct interpretation. The observed VAF is too low for a clonal event, but could be explained by either subclonality OR artifact.\n        *   \"Sanger sequencing is near or below its detection sensitivity at $0.10$ and a negative result would be non-informative.\" - The problem states Sanger's LOD is $\\approx 0.15 - 0.20$. A VAF of $0.10$ is below this limit. Therefore, if Sanger sequencing is negative, it could be because the variant is absent OR because it's present but below the detection limit. A negative result would indeed be non-informative, and a positive result would be surprising and perhaps itself an artifact. This statement is correct.\n        *   \"Prefer orthogonal validation with a duplex Unique Molecular Identifier (true Duplex Sequencing) or an independent PCR-free capture-based assay with duplex error suppression;\" - This is the gold standard for validating low-frequency, high-risk variants. Duplex Sequencing has an extremely low error rate (mentioned in the problem as $<10^{-7}$) because it requires confirmation from both strands of the original DNA molecule, effectively filtering out PCR and sequencing errors. A PCR-free method would eliminate the main source of the suspected artifact (PCR slippage). This is an excellent validation strategy.\n        *   \"if confirmed, report as a subclonal indel, otherwise filter as likely artifact.\" - This is the correct clinical action. If a high-sensitivity method confirms it, it's a true subclonal variant. If not, the weight of evidence points to it being an artifact that should be filtered.\n        *   **Verdict on A**: This option correctly synthesizes all the evidence, correctly assesses the limitations of standard validation methods like Sanger, proposes the most appropriate advanced validation methods, and outlines the correct subsequent action. It seems entirely correct.\n\n    *   **Option B**:\n        *   \"The event is almost certainly a true somatic indel because $k = 120$ reads support it; accept and report without validation.\" - This is dangerously incorrect. It completely ignores all the red flags. The raw read count ($k=120$) is misleading due to PCR amplification artifacts, which is the entire point of using UMIs. The drop to $k_u=8$ unique molecules shows this inflation clearly.\n        *   \"The homopolymer context and strand bias do not meaningfully affect confidence once $k \\ge 100$.\" - This is a false statement. These contextual flags are critical for assessing variant confidence, *especially* when raw read counts are high due to potential amplification artifacts. Ignoring them is a major error in variant interpretation.\n        *   **Verdict on B**: Incorrect. This represents a naive and flawed interpretation of NGS data.\n\n    *   **Option C**:\n        *   \"The observation is most consistent with a Copy Number Variation (CNV) rather than an indel\". A $-1$ bp deletion is an indel, not a CNV. CNVs are large-scale (>1kb) deletions or duplications. A single base deletion is a distinct class of variant. This premise is fundamentally wrong.\n        *   \"the appropriate orthogonal validation is array comparative genomic hybridization\". aCGH is a technology for detecting CNVs. It has a very low resolution and cannot detect single-base indels. This validation method is completely inappropriate for the variant in question.\n        *   \"indels in homopolymers cannot be validated by sequence-based methods.\" - This is false. While challenging, they can be validated, especially with high-fidelity methods like Duplex Sequencing, as mentioned in the problem description and option A.\n        *   **Verdict on C**: Incorrect. It mischaracterizes the variant type and proposes a completely irrelevant validation method based on a false premise.\n\n    *   **Option D**:\n        *   \"The homopolymer context invalidates both short-read and Sanger sequencing\". It doesn't invalidate them, but it makes them error-prone and requires careful analysis. The problem is one of high error rate, not complete invalidation. The current short-read data is informative enough to raise suspicion.\n        *   \"long-read single-molecule nanopore sequencing alone can confirm $-1$ base pair events in $A_8$ tracts at $0.10$ VAF\". Nanopore sequencing has its own challenges with homopolymers. While it can span these regions, its raw read accuracy for indels in homopolymers is notoriously poor, often worse than Illumina short-read sequencing. Specialized analysis is required, but it's not a simple \"silver bullet\" solution, especially for a $10\\%$ VAF variant that might be close to the technology's systematic error rate in that context. Stating it \"alone\" can confirm it is a strong and questionable claim.\n        *   \"and Duplex Sequencing is not suitable for homopolymer-associated indels.\" - This is factually incorrect. Duplex Sequencing is *extremely* well-suited for this problem. By requiring concordance from both strands of an original DNA duplex, it powerfully suppresses PCR and sequencing artifacts, including polymerase slippage in homopolymers. It is one of the best available technologies for this specific challenge.\n        *   **Verdict on D**: Incorrect. This option makes multiple false claims about the capabilities of different sequencing technologies. In particular, it incorrectly dismisses Duplex Sequencing, which is a prime candidate for validation.\n\n    *   **Option E**:\n        *   \"The observation is best explained by a substitution error modeled by base quality recalibration\". The observed variant is a deletion (indel), not a substitution. Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR) is primarily designed to correct systematic errors in base quality scores, which are associated with substitution errors. While there are indel-specific quality scores, the primary mechanism of BQSR is not sufficient to model and correct the high-rate, correlated errors from polymerase slippage.\n        *   \"recalibrating base qualities will remove the signal.\" This is highly unlikely. BQSR might adjust some quality metrics, but it won't typically eliminate a signal supported by $8$ unique molecules at $10\\%$ VAF, especially one resulting from polymerase slippage which is a physical process, not just a base-calling quality issue.\n        *   \"No orthogonal validation is needed once recalibration is applied, even in homopolymers\". This is false and dangerous practice. BQSR is a data processing step, not a validation method. Given the multiple red flags, skipping orthogonal validation would be incorrect.\n        *   \"because substitution error models generalize to indels.\" This is a gross oversimplification and generally untrue. The error profiles and generating mechanisms for substitutions and indels are very different, especially in homopolymer contexts.\n        *   **Verdict on E**: Incorrect. It misidentifies the error type (substitution vs. indel) and misrepresents the function and power of base quality recalibration.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion**: Option A provides the most accurate and comprehensive analysis of the situation. It correctly identifies the warning signs, understands the limitations of different technologies, and proposes the scientifically most rigorous path forward.\n\n6.  **Final Answer Formatting**: The only correct option is A. The final answer should be `$$\\boxed{A}$$`.\n\n7.  **Review and Refine**: I will now write the full solution, ensuring all mathematical entities are in LaTeX and adhering to the strict formatting rules.
