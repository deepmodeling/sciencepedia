A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to compute the squared correlation coefficient of alleles, $r^2$, between two SNP loci after $100$ generations. The evolution of $r^2$ is governed by the decay of linkage disequilibrium ($D$) due to recombination.\n\nFirst, we calculate the allele frequencies for each locus from the initial haplotype frequencies. The allele frequencies remain constant over time under the stated assumptions (no mutation, selection, or drift). Let $p_A$, $p_a$, $p_B$, and $p_b$ be the frequencies of alleles $A$, $a$, $B$, and $b$, respectively.\n\nThe frequency of allele $A$ is the sum of the frequencies of haplotypes containing it:\n$$p_A = f_{AB} + f_{Ab} = 0.25 + 0.35 = 0.60$$\nThe frequency of allele $a$ is:\n$$p_a = f_{aB} + f_{ab} = 0.05 + 0.35 = 0.40$$\nAs a check, $p_A + p_a = 0.60 + 0.40 = 1.0$.\n\nSimilarly, for the second locus:\nThe frequency of allele $B$ is:\n$$p_B = f_{AB} + f_{aB} = 0.25 + 0.05 = 0.30$$\nThe frequency of allele $b$ is:\n$$p_b = f_{Ab} + f_{ab} = 0.35 + 0.35 = 0.70$$\nAs a check, $p_B + p_b = 0.30 + 0.70 = 1.0$.\n\nNext, we calculate the initial coefficient of linkage disequilibrium, $D_0$, at generation $t=0$. $D$ is defined as the difference between the observed frequency of a haplotype (e.g., $AB$) and the frequency expected if the alleles at the two loci were independently associated.\n$$D = f_{AB} - p_A p_B$$\nUsing the initial values:\n$$D_0 = 0.25 - (0.60)(0.30) = 0.25 - 0.18 = 0.07$$\n\nIn the absence of forces other than recombination, linkage disequilibrium decays geometrically over generations. The value of $D$ at generation $t$, denoted $D_t$, is related to its initial value $D_0$ by the equation:\n$$D_t = D_0 (1-c)^t$$\nwhere $c$ is the recombination fraction per generation.

Genotype Frequencies and Conditional Phase Probability**\nA double heterozygote can have one of two genotypes:\n-   Coupling phase: $(ab)/(AB)$. An individual inherits an $ab$ haplotype from one parent and an $AB$ haplotype from the other.\n-   Repulsion (trans) phase: $(aB)/(Ab)$. An individual inherits an $aB$ haplotype from one parent and an $Ab$ haplotype from the other.\n\nUnder Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for a two-locus system, the frequencies of these genotypes in the population are:\n-   Frequency of coupling double heterozygotes: $f_{coup} = 2 \\times P(ab) \\times P(AB)$\n-   Frequency of trans double heterozygotes: $f_{trans} = 2 \\times P(aB) \\times P(Ab)$\n\nThe total frequency of double heterozygotes in the population is $f_{DH} = f_{coup} + f_{trans}$. The conditional probability of a double heterozygote being in the trans configuration is the ratio of the frequency of trans double heterozygotes to the total frequency of all double heterozygotes.\n$$P(\\text{trans} | DH) = \\frac{f_{trans}}{f_{coup} + f_{trans}} = \\frac{2 P(aB) P(Ab)}{2 P(ab) P(AB) + 2 P(aB) P(Ab)} = \\frac{P(aB) P(Ab)}{P(ab) P(AB) + P(aB) P(Ab)}$$\n\n**3. Numerical Calculation**\nFirst, we compute the haplotype frequencies using the given values:\n-   $p_a = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$\n-   $p_b = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}$\n-   $D = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}$\n\n$P(ab) = (1.0 \\times 10^{-4})(5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) + 1.0 \\times 10^{-8} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-9} + 1.0 \\times 10^{-8} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-8}$\n$P(aB) = p_a - P(ab) = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} - 1.5 \\times 10^{-8} = 100 \\times 10^{-6} - 0.015 \\times 10^{-6} = 99.985 \\times 10^{-6} = 9.9985 \\times 10^{-5}$\n$P(Ab) = p_b - P(ab) = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5} - 1.5 \\times 10^{-8} = 50 \\times 10^{-6} - 0.015 \\times 10^{-6} = 49.985 \\times 10^{-6} = 4.9985 \\times 10^{-5}$\n$P(AB) = 1 - p_a - p_b + P(ab) = 1 - 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} - 5.0 \\times 10^{-5} + 1.5 \\times 10^{-8} = 1 - 0.00015 + 0.000000015 = 0.999850015$\n\nNext, we compute the products of haplotype frequencies needed for the conditional probability formula.\nLet $R = P(aB)P(Ab)$ and $C = P(ab)P(AB)$.\n$R = (9.9985 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times (4.9985 \\times 10^{-5}) = 4.997750225 \\times 10^{-9}$\n$C = (1.5 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times (0.999850015) = 1.4997750225 \\times 10^{-8}$\n\nNow, we calculate $P(\\text{trans} | DH)$:\n$$P(\\text{trans} | DH) = \\frac{R}{C+R} = \\frac{4.997750225 \\times 10^{-9}}{1.4997750225 \\times 10^{-8} + 4.997750225 \\times 10^{-9}}$$\n$$P(\\text{trans} | DH) = \\frac{4.997750225 \\times 10^{-9}}{1.999550045 \\times 10^{-8}} = 0.24994624...$$\n\n**4. Final Probability Calculation**\nFinally, we assemble the components to find the required posterior probability $P_{causal}$:\n$$P_{causal} = P(\\text{trans} | DH) \\times q_a \\times q_b \\times \\pi$$\n$$P_{causal} = (0.24994624...) \\times (0.99) \\times (0.80) \\times (0.95)$$\nFirst, we compute the product of the given probabilities:\n$$q_a \\times q_b \\times \\pi = 0.99 \\times 0.80 \\times 0.95 = 0.7524$$\nThen, we multiply by the phase probability:\n$$P_{causal} = 0.24994624... \\times 0.7524 = 0.18805957...$$\n\n**5. Rounding**\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P_{causal} \\approx 0.1881$$\nThe posterior probability that the proband carries a causal compound heterozygous genotype is $0.1881$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1881}$$", "id": "4351771"}]}
