The current is $I = G V = (\\sigma A_{\\mathrm{eff}}/L)V$.\n\n- **Open-Pore Current ($I_0$)**:\nThe cross-sectional area is $A_0 = \\pi r_p^2$.\n$A_0 = \\pi (2.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2 \\approx 1.9635 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2$.\nThe conductance is $G_0 = \\sigma A_0 / L = (11\\ \\mathrm{S/m}) (1.9635 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2) / (10 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\approx 2.1598 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{S}$, or $21.60\\ \\mathrm{nS}$.\nThe open-pore current is $I_0 = G_0 V = (2.1598 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{S}) (0.2\\ \\mathrm{V}) \\approx 4.3196 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{A}$, or $4.32\\ \\mathrm{nA}$.\n\n- **Single-Strand Blockade Current ($I_{\\mathrm{ss}}$)**:\nThe effective area is $A_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\pi (r_p^2 - r_{\\mathrm{ss}}^2)$.\n$A_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\pi [(2.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2 - (0.6 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2] = \\pi(6.25 - 0.36) \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2 = 5.89 \\pi \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2 \\approx 1.8504 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2$.\nThe conductance is $G_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\sigma A_{\\mathrm{ss}} / L = (11\\ \\mathrm{S/m}) (1.8504 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2) / (10 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\approx 2.0354 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{S}$, or $20.35\\ \\mathrm{nS}$.\nThe current is $I_{\\mathrm{ss}} = G_{\\mathrm{ss}} V = (2.0354 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{S}) (0.2\\ \\mathrm{V}) \\approx 4.0708 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{A}$, or $4.07\\ \\mathrm{nA}$.\n\n- **Double-Strand Blockade Current ($I_{\\mathrm{ds}}$)**:\nThe effective area is $A_{\\mathrm{ds}} = \\pi (r_p^2 - r_{\\mathrm{ds}}^2)$.\n$A_{\\mathrm{ds}} = \\pi [(2.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2 - (1.3 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2] = \\pi(6.25 - 1.69) \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2 = 4.56 \\pi \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2 \\approx 1.4326 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2$.\nThe conductance is $G_{\\mathrm{ds}} = \\sigma A_{\\mathrm{ds}} / L = (11\\ \\mathrm{S/m}) (1.4326 \\times 10^{-17}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2) / (10 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\approx 1.5758 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{S}$, or $15.76\\ \\mathrm{nS}$.\nThe current is $I_{\\mathrm{ds}} = G_{\\mathrm{ds}} V = (1.5758 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{S}) (0.2\\ \\mathrm{V}) \\approx 3.1516 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{A}$, or $3.15\\ \\mathrm{nA}$.\n\nBased on these calculations, the passage of a hairpin, which involves both single-stranded and double-stranded regions, should show at least two distinct blockade levels. The ordering is $I_{\\mathrm{ds}} < I_{\\mathrm{ss}} < I_0$, meaning the thicker double-stranded stem produces a deeper current blockade.\n\n- **Non-Specific Particle Blockade Current ($I_{b}$)**:\nThe effective area is $A_{b} = \\pi (r_p^2 - r_{b}^2)$.\n$A_{b} = \\pi [(2.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2 - (2.4 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2] = \\pi(6.25 - 5.76) \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2 = 0.49 \\pi \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2 \\approx 1.539 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2$.\nThe conductance is $G_b = \\sigma A_b / L \\approx (11\\ \\mathrm{S/m}) (1.539 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2) / (10 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\approx 1.693 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{S}$, or $1.69\\ \\mathrm{nS}$.\nThe current is $I_b = G_b V = (1.693 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{S}) (0.2\\ \\mathrm{V}) \\approx 0.3386 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{A}$, or $0.34\\ \\mathrm{nA}$.\nThis represents a very deep, near-complete blockade, far different from the hairpin levels.\n\n**2. Analysis of Dwell Time and Kinetics**\n\nThe rate of hairpin unzipping is given by $k(V) \\propto \\exp\\!\\big(-[\\Delta G^\\ddagger - f x^\\ddagger]/(k_B T)\\big)$.\nThe force is $f = q_{\\mathrm{eff}} E$ and the field is $E=V/L$. Thus, $f \\propto V$.\nLet $f x^\\ddagger = c V$ where $c$ is a positive constant incorporating $q_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, $x^\\ddagger$, and $L$. The rate becomes:\n$k(V) \\propto \\exp\\!\\big(-[\\Delta G^\\ddagger - cV]/(k_B T)\\big) = \\exp(-\\Delta G^\\ddagger/k_B T) \\exp(cV/k_B T)$.\nThis shows that the rate of unzipping, $k(V)$, increases exponentially with the applied voltage $V$.\nThe mean dwell time, $\\tau$, in a state is inversely proportional to the rate of leaving that state, i.e., $\\tau \\approx 1/k(V)$.\nTherefore, the dwell time associated with the unzipping process is expected to *decrease* as the voltage $V$ is increased.\nThe stochastic switching between two states (e.g., zipped stem in the pore vs. unzipped strand translocating) is known as telegraph noise. The power spectral density (PSD) of such a process has a Lorentzian form: $P(f) \\propto \\frac{1}{f_c^2 + f^2}$, where $f_c$ is the corner frequency. The corner frequency is related to the sum of the forward and reverse transition rates. Since these rates, particularly the unzipping rate, are strongly dependent on voltage, the corner frequency $f_c$ will increase with increasing voltage $V$.\nIn contrast, a transient mechanical blockage by a non-specific particle is not an activated process with an internal free energy barrier like $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$. While its capture and release might be influenced by voltage (electrophoresis), its dwell time statistics would not necessarily follow the same strong exponential dependence on $V$ and are often treated as being relatively insensitive to voltage for differentiation purposes.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A two-level step-wise blockade is observed during hairpin passage, with an initial level near the single-strand occupancy and a deeper level when the double-stranded stem occupies the pore; numerically, the levels are approximately $I_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\approx 4.07\\ \\mathrm{nA}$ and $I_{\\mathrm{ds}} \\approx 3.15\\ \\mathrm{nA}$ given the device parameters, contrasted with the open-pore current $I_0 \\approx 4.32\\ \\mathrm{nA}$. Dwell times are approximately exponentially distributed and decrease with increasing $V$ (i.e., faster unzipping at higher field), and the two-state switching produces a telegraph-noise power spectral density (PSD) with a Lorentzian form whose corner frequency increases with $V$.**\n- **Analysis**: This option correctly describes a multi-level blockade corresponding to the different structures of the hairpin. The calculated current levels ($I_0 \\approx 4.32\\ \\mathrm{nA}$, $I_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\approx 4.07\\ \\mathrm{nA}$, $I_{\\mathrm{ds}} \\approx 3.15\\ \\mathrm{nA}$) match our derivation perfectly. It correctly states that the double-stranded stem produces a deeper blockade ($I_{\\mathrm{ds}} < I_{\\mathrm{ss}}$). It correctly predicts that dwell times decrease with increasing voltage $V$, as derived from the provided rate equation. The description of the signal as telegraph noise with a voltage-dependent Lorentzian PSD is also a correct biophysical consequence. This option comprehensively and accurately describes the expected signature of hairpin unzipping.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Events consistent with transient blockages show a near-complete current collapse toward $I \\approx 0.34\\ \\mathrm{nA}$ with no discernible sublevels, and dwell statistics are insensitive to $V$; therefore, such a feature set should be used to identify hairpin formation/unzipping.**\n- **Analysis**: The calculation of the blockage current $I_b \\approx 0.34\\ \\mathrm{nA}$ is correct. The description of a transient blockage having a single deep level and dwell statistics that are largely insensitive to voltage is a valid way to distinguish it from a hairpin event. However, the final clause \"therefore, such a feature set should be used to identify hairpin formation/unzipping\" contains a logical error. This feature set identifies a *transient blockage*, not a hairpin. It describes what a hairpin event is *not*. The question asks for the signature that *identifies* the hairpin.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Hairpin stems produce shallower blockade than single-stranded tails because double-stranded segments have lower linear charge density; therefore the expected level ordering is $I_{\\mathrm{ds}} > I_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, and dwell times increase with $V$ due to field-stabilization of the hairpin.**\n- **Analysis**: This option makes three incorrect claims. First, hairpin stems ($r_{\\mathrm{ds}} \\approx 1.3\\ \\mathrm{nm}$) are thicker than single strands ($r_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\approx 0.6\\ \\mathrm{nm}$), so they block more area and produce a *deeper* (lower current) blockade, not a shallower one. Our calculation confirms $I_{\\mathrm{ds}} < I_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. Second, the reasoning about linear charge density is a distractor and does not determine blockade depth in this model. Third, the claim that dwell times increase with $V$ is directly contrary to the provided model, which states the field helps overcome the unzipping barrier, thus *decreasing* dwell times.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Hairpin signatures are characterized by periodic current oscillations at kilohertz frequencies that do not change with $V$, and blockade amplitudes are independent of whether single-stranded or double-stranded segments occupy the pore.**\n- **Analysis**: This option is incorrect on multiple counts. Hairpin unzipping is a stochastic process leading to random telegraph noise, not periodic oscillations at a fixed frequency. The kinetics, and thus the characteristic frequency of this noise, are voltage-dependent, so the signature must change with $V$. Finally, the blockade amplitudes are explicitly dependent on the radius of the occupying segment ($r_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ vs $r_{\\mathrm{ds}}$), which are different.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A provides the only description that is fully consistent with the physical models and parameters given in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the current levels, correctly identifies their ordering, and correctly deduces the voltage-dependent kinetic signature.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4363236"}]}
