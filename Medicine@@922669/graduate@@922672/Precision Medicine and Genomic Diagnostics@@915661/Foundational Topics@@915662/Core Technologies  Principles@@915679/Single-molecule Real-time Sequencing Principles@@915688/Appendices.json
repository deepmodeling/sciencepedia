First, we derive the general expression for the consensus error probability and the corresponding quality score. Second, we apply this to a specific dataset to calculate a probability.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Basewise Consensus Error Probability ($p_{\\mathrm{err}}(N)$) and Quality Value ($\\mathrm{QV}(N)$)**\n\nLet us consider a single nucleotide position. Assume the true base at this position is $B_T$. The sequencing process involves $N$ independent passes. In each pass, a base is read.\n\nThe per-pass substitution error probability is given as $\\epsilon$. Thus, for a single pass:\n- The probability of reading the correct base $B_T$ is $P(\\text{correct}) = 1 - \\epsilon$.\n- The probability of reading any of the three incorrect bases is $\\epsilon$. Since all incorrect nucleotides are equally likely, the probability of reading a specific incorrect base (e.g., $B_{I1}$) is $P(\\text{specific incorrect}) = \\epsilon/3$.\n\nThe consensus calling rule is a strict majority vote. A base is assigned to the position if and only if it is observed in more than $N/2$ of the passes. The number of votes required for a majority is $k_{maj} = \\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor + 1$.\n\nA consensus error occurs if the assigned consensus base is not the true base $B_T$. This happens if one of the three incorrect bases, say $B_{I1}$, $B_{I2}$, or $B_{I3}$, achieves a majority of votes. Let $k_{I1}$, $k_{I2}$, and $k_{I3}$ be the number of times each of these incorrect bases is observed in $N$ passes. A miscall to $B_{I1}$ occurs if $k_{I1} \\geq k_{maj}$.\n\nThe events that $B_{I1}$ gets a majority, $B_{I2}$ gets a majority, or $B_{I3}$ gets a majority are mutually exclusive. For instance, if $k_{I1} > N/2$ and $k_{I2} > N/2$, then $k_{I1} + k_{I2} > N$, which is impossible as the total number of passes is $N$. Therefore, the total consensus error probability, $p_{\\mathrm{err}}(N)$, is the sum of the probabilities of each incorrect base being called:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{err}}(N) = P(k_{I1} \\geq k_{maj}) + P(k_{I2} \\geq k_{maj}) + P(k_{I3} \\geq k_{maj})$$\nDue to symmetry, the probability of any specific incorrect base achieving a majority is the same.
