It uses established concepts from molecular biology and biophysics, such as DNA hybridization, melting temperature ($T_m$), guanine-cytosine content ($f_{\\mathrm{GC}}$), and the Wallace approximation, which is a known empirical rule. The problem is well-posed. The provided information ($N$ and $f_{\\mathrm{GC}}$) is sufficient and consistent to determine the counts $(A+T)$ and $(G+C)$. The calculation of $(G+C) = f_{\\mathrm{GC}} \\times N = 0.60 \\times 25 = 15$ yields an integer, which is a necessary condition for a physically realistic nucleotide count, thereby avoiding a contradiction. The problem is objective, using precise-defined scientific terms. There are no violations of scientific principles, ambiguities, or missing information.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Part I: Calculation of Melting Temperature ($T_m$)**\n\nThe total number of nucleotides in the probe is given as $N = 25$. This total is the sum of all individual base counts:\n$$\nN = A + T + G + C = (A+T) + (G+C)\n$$\nwhere $A$, $T$, $G$, and $C$ represent the counts of adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, respectively.\n\nThe guanine-cytosine content fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{GC}}$, is defined as the ratio of the number of guanine and cytosine bases to the total number of nucleotides:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{GC}} = \\frac{G+C}{N}\n$$\nWe are given $f_{\\mathrm{GC}} = 0.60$ and $N=25$. We can calculate the total count of guanine and cytosine bases, $(G+C)$:\n$$\n(G+C) = f_{\\mathrm{GC}} \\times N = 0.60 \\times 25 = 15\n$$\nSince the total number of nucleotides is $N=25$, we can now find the total count of adenine and thymine bases, $(A+T)$:\n$$\n(A+T) = N - (G+C) = 25 - 15 = 10\n$$\nNow, we use the provided Wallace approximation formula for the melting temperature, $T_m$:\n$$\nT_{m} \\approx 2\\,(A+T) + 4\\,(G+C)\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated counts for $(A+T)$ and $(G+C)$:\n$$\nT_{m} \\approx 2\\,(10) + 4\\,(15)\n$$\n$$\nT_{m} \\approx 20 + 60\n$$\n$$\nT_{m} \\approx 80\n$$\nThe estimated melting temperature for this probe is $80\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\n**Solution Part II: Thermodynamic Justification**\n\nFrom first principles, the hybridization of two complementary DNA strands is a thermodynamic process characterized by changes in enthalpy ($\\Delta H$) and entropy ($\\Delta S$). The change in Gibbs free energy for duplex formation is given by $\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S$. The melting temperature, $T_m$, is defined as the temperature at which half of the duplexes have dissociated. At this equilibrium point, under specific standard conditions, the free energy change can be related to the enthalpy and entropy changes, yielding the fundamental relationship $T_m \\approx \\frac{\\Delta H}{\\Delta S}$. More accurately, $T_m$ depends on the total strand concentration, $C_T$, as $T_m = \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ}}{\\Delta S^{\\circ} + R \\ln(C_T)}$.\n\nThe Wallace approximation is a simple, composition-based empirical rule. It correctly captures the general observation that G-C pairs, having three hydrogen bonds, are more stable and contribute more to $T_m$ than A-T pairs, which have two hydrogen bonds. However, it oversimplifies the complex thermodynamics of DNA duplex stability and deviates from more comprehensive nearest-neighbor (NN) models for several reasons rooted in the true nature of $\\Delta H$ and $\\Delta S$.\n\nThe NN model posits that the overall stability of a DNA duplex ($\\Delta H$ and $\\Delta S$) is not just a sum of individual base pair contributions, but is dominated by the energetic contributions of adjacent, or \"nearest-neighbor,\" base pair stacks. For example, the thermodynamic parameters for a G-C pair in the sequence `...AGC...` are different from those for a G-C pair in `...GGC...`. This is because base stacking interactions, which involve favorable van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions between the planar aromatic rings of adjacent base pairs, are highly sequence-dependent and are a major source of duplex stability.\n\nThe Wallace approximation fails to account for at least three critical factors that are incorporated into nearest-neighbor models:\n\n1.  **Sequence-Dependent Base Stacking Interactions:** The Wallace rule treats every G-C pair and every A-T pair as thermodynamically identical, regardless of its neighbors. It is a purely composition-based rule. The NN model, by contrast, uses a library of distinct thermodynamic parameters ($\\Delta H^{\\circ}$ and $\\Delta S^{\\circ}$) for each of the $10$ unique nearest-neighbor steps (e.g., `AA/TT`, `AG/CT`, `GA/TC`, etc.), correctly reflecting that duplex stability is highly sequence-dependent due to these stacking effects.\n\n2.  **Salt Concentration:** The electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged phosphate backbones of the two DNA strands is a major destabilizing force. Cations in the buffer (e.g., $\\text{Na}^{+}$) shield these charges, stabilizing the duplex and increasing $T_m$. The Wallace rule is calibrated for a specific \"standard\" salt concentration (typically $0.9\\,\\text{M NaCl}$) and lacks a term to adjust for different ionic strengths. NN models include explicit salt correction terms that modify the $T_m$ based on the molar concentration of monovalent and divalent cations.\n\n3.  **Oligonucleotide Concentration:** DNA hybridization is a bimolecular reaction. According to Le Châtelier's principle, the equilibrium between single strands and duplex is concentration-dependent. Higher strand concentrations favor duplex formation, leading to a higher $T_m$. The thermodynamic equation for $T_m$ includes a logarithmic dependence on the total oligonucleotide concentration ($C_T$). The Wallace rule is an empirical fit that provides a single $T_m$ value, implicitly assuming a standard concentration range and ignoring this effect entirely.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{80}\n$$", "id": "4358903"}, {"introduction": "A well-designed microarray experiment is essential for generating statistically robust and reproducible findings.

Maximizing power is equivalent to minimizing the variance of the estimator of $\\Delta$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is well-grounded in biostatistics and genomics. The hierarchical model ($Y_{gij} = \\mu_g + b_{gi} + \\epsilon_{gij}$) is a standard linear mixed-effects model for analyzing data with nested sources of variation, such as biological and technical variability in microarray experiments.

It presents a clear objective function (minimizing the variance of the estimator for $\\Delta$) and a well-defined constraint (budget). The parameters are specified, and a unique integer solution for $(n,r)$ is expected, or at least a best choice among the given options.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. All terms are either standard in the field or explicitly defined.\n\nThe problem statement does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, complete, and non-trivial.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem has two parts: correctly identifying the definitions of biological and technical replicates, and finding the optimal experimental design $(n,r)$ that maximizes statistical power.\n\n**Part 1: Definitions of Replicates**\n\nIn biological experiments:\n-   **Biological replicates** are parallel measurements of biologically distinct samples. In this context, they are samples from distinct individuals (e.g., different patients). They are used to assess biological variability within a population.\n-   **Technical replicates** are repeated measurements of the same biological sample. In this context, this means taking the same extracted mRNA sample and running it on multiple microarrays (repeated hybridizations). They are used to assess the precision and reliability of the measurement technique itself (technical variability).\n\nBased on these standard definitions, the statement \"Biological replicates are distinct individuals; technical replicates are repeated hybridizations of the same extracted sample\" is correct. The alternative, \"Biological replicates are repeated hybridizations of the same extracted sample; technical replicates are distinct individuals,\" is incorrect as it reverses the definitions.\n\n**Part 2: Mathematical Optimization**\n\nThe goal is to maximize statistical power for testing $\\Delta \\neq 0$. For a test based on the estimator $\\hat{\\Delta}$, power is a monotonically decreasing function of $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta})$. Therefore, we must find the pair $(n,r)$ that minimizes $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta})$ subject to the budget constraint.\n\n**2.1. Derivation of the Estimator's Variance**\n\nFirst, we formalize the estimator for $\\mu_g$.\nThe average over technical replicates for biological sample $i$ in condition $g$ is:\n$$ \\bar{Y}_{gi\\cdot} = \\frac{1}{r} \\sum_{j=1}^{r} Y_{gij} = \\frac{1}{r} \\sum_{j=1}^{r} (\\mu_g + b_{gi} + \\epsilon_{gij}) = \\mu_g + b_{gi} + \\frac{1}{r}\\sum_{j=1}^{r} \\epsilon_{gij} = \\mu_g + b_{gi} + \\bar{\\epsilon}_{gi\\cdot} $$\nThe estimator for the condition mean $\\mu_g$ is the average of these values across the $n$ biological samples:\n$$ \\hat{\\mu}_g = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\bar{Y}_{gi\\cdot} $$\nThe variance of $\\hat{\\mu}_g$ is calculated as follows. First, the variance of $\\bar{Y}_{gi\\cdot}$:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{gi\\cdot}) = \\text{Var}(\\mu_g + b_{gi} + \\bar{\\epsilon}_{gi\\cdot}) $$\nSince $\\mu_g$ is a constant and $b_{gi}$ and $\\epsilon_{gij}$ (and thus $\\bar{\\epsilon}_{gi\\cdot}$) are independent:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{gi\\cdot}) = \\text{Var}(b_{gi}) + \\text{Var}(\\bar{\\epsilon}_{gi\\cdot}) = \\sigma_b^2 + \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\sum_{j=1}^{r} \\epsilon_{gij}\\right) $$\nBecause the $\\epsilon_{gij}$ are i.i.d., $\\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{r} \\epsilon_{gij}\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{r} \\text{Var}(\\epsilon_{gij}) = r\\sigma_t^2$.\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{gi\\cdot}) = \\sigma_b^2 + \\frac{1}{r^2} (r\\sigma_t^2) = \\sigma_b^2 + \\frac{\\sigma_t^2}{r} $$\nThe biological samples are independent, so the $\\bar{Y}_{gi\\cdot}$ are independent for $i=1,\\dots,n$. The variance of $\\hat{\\mu}_g$ is:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}_g) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\bar{Y}_{gi\\cdot}\\right) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{gi\\cdot}) = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\left(n \\left(\\sigma_b^2 + \\frac{\\sigma_t^2}{r}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_b^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma_t^2}{nr} $$\nThe estimator for the differential expression is $\\hat{\\Delta} = \\hat{\\mu}_1 - \\hat{\\mu}_0$. Since the two conditions are handled by independent sets of samples, $\\hat{\\mu}_1$ and $\\hat{\\mu}_0$ are independent.\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}_1) + \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}_0) = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_b^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma_t^2}{nr}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_b^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma_t^2}{nr}\\right) = 2 \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_b^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma_t^2}{nr} \\right) $$\n\n**2.2. The Optimization Problem**\n\nWe need to minimize the variance function $V(n,r) = \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta})$ subject to the budget constraint.\nSubstitute the given values: $\\sigma_b^2 = 1$, $\\sigma_t^2 = 4$, $c_b = 200$, $c_t = 100$, $B=4000$.\n\nObjective function to minimize:\n$$ V(n,r) = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{4}{nr} \\right) = \\frac{2}{n} + \\frac{8}{nr} $$\nBudget constraint:\n$$ 2n(c_b + r c_t) \\le B \\implies 2n(200 + r \\cdot 100) \\le 4000 $$\n$$ n(200 + 100r) \\le 2000 $$\n$$ n(2+r) \\le 20 $$\nWe are looking for integers $n \\ge 1$ and $r \\ge 1$ that minimize $V(n,r)$ under this constraint.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nWe now evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Biological replicates are repeated hybridizations of the same extracted sample; technical replicates are distinct individuals. Choose $n=6$ and $r=1$.**\n-   **Definition**: The definitions of biological and technical replicates are incorrect.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.

Since $20 \\le 20$, this allocation is valid and fully utilizes the budget. The cost is $2 \\cdot 5 (200 + 2 \\cdot 100) = 10(400) = 4000$ USD.\n-   **Variance calculation**: $V(5,2) = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{8}{5 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{10} + \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{12}{10} = 1.2$.\n-   **Verdict**: This option is a valid candidate. We must compare its variance to other valid options.\n\n**C. Biological replicates are distinct individuals; technical replicates are repeated hybridizations of the same extracted sample.

Since $20 \\le 20$, this allocation is valid and fully utilizes the budget. The cost is $2 \\cdot 4 (200 + 3 \\cdot 100) = 8(500) = 4000$ USD.\n-   **Variance calculation**: $V(4,3) = \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{8}{4 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{3}{6} + \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{7}{6} \\approx 1.167$.\n-   **Verdict**: This option is also a valid candidate. Comparing its variance to option B: $V(4,3) = 7/6 \\approx 1.167$ and $V(5,2) = 1.2$. Since $1.167  1.2$, the allocation $(n,r)=(4,3)$ yields a lower variance and thus higher statistical power than $(n,r)=(5,2)$. Therefore, option C is superior to option B.\n\n**D. Biological replicates are repeated hybridizations of the same extracted sample; technical replicates are distinct individuals. Choose $n=3$ and $r=4$.**\n-   **Definition**: The definitions of biological and technical replicates are incorrect.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The definitional part of this option is factually wrong.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n-   Options A and D are incorrect because they misstate the definitions of biological and technical replicates.\n-   Options B and C correctly state the definitions.\n-   We must choose between the allocations $(n,r)=(5,2)$ from option B and $(n,r)=(4,3)$ from option C.\n-   The variance for option B is $V(5,2) = 1.2$.\n-   The variance for option C is $V(4,3) = 7/6 \\approx 1.167$.\n-   Since a lower variance corresponds to higher statistical power, the allocation $(n,r)=(4,3)$ is the optimal choice between B and C.\n-   Thus, option C provides the allocation that maximizes statistical power among the choices with correct definitions. A more formal analysis confirms that $(n,r)=(4,3)$ is indeed the optimal integer solution, as the continuous optimum for $r$ is $\\sqrt{(\\sigma_t^2 c_b) / (\\sigma_b^2 c_t)} = \\sqrt{(4 \\cdot 200)/(1 \\cdot 100)} = \\sqrt{8} \\approx 2.83$, and checking integer neighbors $r=2$ and $r=3$ with full budget use confirms $(n,r)=(4,3)$ is better than $(n,r)=(5,2)$.\n\nTherefore, option C is the only one that is both definitionaly correct and provides the optimal allocation among the given choices.\nFinal check on calculations:\n$V(5,2) = 1.2 = 6/5$.\n$V(4,3) = 7/6$.\nCompare $6/5$ and $7/6$. Convert to common denominator $30$: $36/30$ vs $35/30$. Indeed, $7/6  6/5$. The calculation is correct.\n\n**Final Verdict on Options:**\n-   A: **Incorrect**. Incorrect definition.\n-   B: **Incorrect**. Correct definition, but suboptimal allocation compared to C.\n-   C: **Correct**.

Normal diploid cells: Contribute a fraction $(1 - \\alpha)$ to the sample, with a copy number of $2$.\n2.  Diploid tumor cells (without alteration): Contribute a fraction $\\alpha(1 - \\beta)$ to the sample, with a copy number of $2$.\n3.  Altered tumor cells (subclone): Contribute a fraction $\\alpha\\beta$ to the sample, with a copy number we will denote as $C_{alt}$.\n\nThe average copy number $C_{avg, T}$ is therefore:\n$$C_{avg, T} = (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot 2 + \\alpha(1 - \\beta) \\cdot 2 + \\alpha\\beta \\cdot C_{alt}$$\nLet's simplify this expression:\n$$C_{avg, T} = 2 - 2\\alpha + 2\\alpha(1 - \\beta) + \\alpha\\beta C_{alt}$$\n$$C_{avg, T} = 2 - 2\\alpha + 2\\alpha - 2\\alpha\\beta + \\alpha\\beta C_{alt}$$\n$$C_{avg, T} = 2 - 2\\alpha\\beta + \\alpha\\beta C_{alt}$$\nThis can be rewritten to highlight the deviation from the diploid state:\n$$C_{avg, T} = 2 + \\alpha\\beta(C_{alt} - 2)$$\nThis general formula for the average copy number in the tumor sample can now be applied to the two specific cases.\n\n(i) Single-copy gain in the tumor subclone:\nA single-copy gain means the altered cells have one extra copy of the DNA segment relative to the diploid state. Since diploid is copy number $2$, the altered copy number is $C_{alt} = 2 + 1 = 3$.\nSubstituting $C_{alt} = 3$ into the expression for $C_{avg, T}$:\n$$C_{avg, T}^{(gain)} = 2 + \\alpha\\beta(3 - 2) = 2 + \\alpha\\beta$$\nThe expected logarithmic ratio shift for a gain, $R_{gain}$, is:\n$$R_{gain} = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{C_{avg, T}^{(gain)}}{2}\\right) = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{2 + \\alpha\\beta}{2}\\right)$$\nSimplifying the argument of the logarithm gives the final expression:\n$$R_{gain} = \\log_2\\left(1 + \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{2}\\right)$$\n\n(ii) Single-copy loss in the tumor subclone:\nA single-copy loss means the altered cells have one fewer copy of the DNA segment relative to the diploid state. The altered copy number is $C_{alt} = 2 - 1 = 1$.\nSubstituting $C_{alt} = 1$ into the expression for $C_{avg, T}$:\n$$C_{avg, T}^{(loss)} = 2 + \\alpha\\beta(1 - 2) = 2 - \\alpha\\beta$$\nThe expected logarithmic ratio shift for a loss, $R_{loss}$, is:\n$$R_{loss} = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{C_{avg, T}^{(loss)}}{2}\\right) = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{2 - \\alpha\\beta}{2}\\right)$$\nSimplifying the argument of the logarithm gives the final expression:\n$$R_{loss} = \\log_2\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{2}\\right)$$\n\nThe two derived expressions provide the expected base-$2$ logarithmic ratio shifts for a single-copy gain and a single-copy loss, respectively, as functions of tumor purity $\\alpha$ and subclonal fraction $\\beta$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\log_2\\left(1 + \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{2}\\right)  \\log_2\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{2}\\right)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4358973"}]}
