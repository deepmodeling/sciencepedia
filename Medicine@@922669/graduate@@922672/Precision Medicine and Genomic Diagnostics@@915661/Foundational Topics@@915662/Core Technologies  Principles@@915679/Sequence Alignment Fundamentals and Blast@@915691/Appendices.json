Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Solution\n\n**Derivation of the Dynamic Programming Recurrence and Boundary Conditions**\n\nLet $F(i,j)$ be the score of the optimal global alignment between the prefix of sequence $X$ of length $i$, denoted $X[1 \\dots i]$, and the prefix of sequence $Y$ of length $j$, denoted $Y[1 \\dots j]$. We are tasked with finding $F(m,n)$.\n\nThe principle of optimal substructure states that an optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems. We seek to find the score $F(i,j)$ by considering the three possible ways an alignment of $X[1 \\dots i]$ and $Y[1 \\dots j]$ can end:\n\n1.  **Aligning $X[i]$ with $Y[j]$:** The alignment ends with the pair $(X[i], Y[j])$. The score of this operation is $s(X[i], Y[j])$, which is $s_{\\text{match}}$ if $X[i]=Y[j]$ and $s_{\\text{mismatch}}$ if $X[i] \\neq Y[j]$. The preceding part of the alignment must be an optimal alignment of the prefixes $X[1 \\dots i-1]$ and $Y[1 \\dots j-1]$, which has a score of $F(i-1, j-1)$. The total score from this case is $F(i-1, j-1) + s(X[i], Y[j])$.\n\n2.  **Aligning $X[i]$ with a gap:** The alignment ends with the pair $(X[i], -)$, where $-$ denotes a gap character. The score of this operation is the gap penalty, $g$. The preceding part of the alignment must be an optimal alignment of the prefixes $X[1 \\dots i-1]$ and $Y[1 \\dots j]$, which has a score of $F(i-1, j)$. The total score from this case is $F(i-1, j) + g$. This corresponds to a vertical move in the dynamic programming matrix.\n\n3.  **Aligning $Y[j]$ with a gap:** The alignment ends with the pair $(-, Y[j])$. The score of this operation is the gap penalty, $g$. The preceding part of the alignment must be an optimal alignment of the prefixes $X[1 \\dots i]$ and $Y[1 \\dots j-1]$, which has a score of $F(i, j-1)$. The total score from this case is $F(i, j-1) + g$. This corresponds to a horizontal move in the dynamic programming matrix.\n\nThe optimal score $F(i,j)$ is the maximum of the scores from these three cases. This defines the recurrence relation for $i>0$ and $j>0$:\n$$F(i, j) = \\max \\begin{cases} F(i-1, j-1) + s(X[i], Y[j]) & \\text{(Diagonal)} \\\\ F(i-1, j) + g & \\text{(Vertical)} \\\\ F(i, j-1) + g & \\text{(Horizontal)} \\end{cases}$$\n\nThe **boundary conditions** initialize the first row and column of the dynamic programming matrix:\n*   $F(0,0) = 0$: The score for aligning two empty strings is $0$.\n*   $F(i,0) = i \\times g$ for $i > 0$: The score for aligning the prefix $X[1..i]$ with an empty string requires $i$ gaps.\n*   $F(0,j) = j \\times g$ for $j > 0$: The score for aligning an empty string with the prefix $Y[1..j]$ requires $j$ gaps.\n\n**Construction of the Dynamic Programming Matrix**\n\nWe construct a $(m+1) \\times (n+1)$ or $6 \\times 5$ matrix for $X=\\text{ACGTT}$ and $Y=\\text{AGTT}$. The scoring parameters are $s_{\\text{match}}=+1$, $s_{\\text{mismatch}}=-1$, and $g=-2$.\n\nFirst, we initialize the boundary conditions:\n$F(i, 0) = i \\times (-2)$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n$F(0, j) = j \\times (-2)$ for $j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\n$F(0,0) = 0$\n$F(1,0) = -2, F(2,0) = -4, F(3,0) = -6, F(4,0) = -8, F(5,0) = -10$.\n$F(0,1) = -2, F(0,2) = -4, F(0,3) = -6, F(0,4) = -8$.\n\nNext, we fill the rest of the matrix using the recurrence relation:\n\nFor $F(1,1)$ ($A$ vs $A$, match): $F(1,1) = \\max(F(0,0)+1, F(0,1)-2, F(1,0)-2) = \\max(1, -4, -4) = 1$.\nFor $F(2,1)$ ($C$ vs $A$, mismatch): $F(2,1) = \\max(F(1,0)-1, F(1,1)-2, F(2,0)-2) = \\max(-3, -1, -6) = -1$.\n...and so on for all cells.\n\nThe complete dynamic programming matrix $F(i,j)$ is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\n& & \\text{_} & \\text{A} & \\text{G} & \\text{T} & \\text{T} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{_} & \\mathbf{0} &  -2 &  -4 &  -6 &  -8 \\\\\n\\text{A} &  -2 & \\mathbf{1} &  -1 &  -3 &  -5 \\\\\n\\text{C} &  -4 & \\mathbf{-1} &  0 &  -2 &  -4 \\\\\n\\text{G} &  -6 &  -3 & \\mathbf{0} &  -1 &  -3 \\\\\n\\text{T} &  -8 &  -5 &  -2 & \\mathbf{1} &  0 \\\\\n\\text{T} & -10 &  -7 &  -4 & -1 & \\mathbf{2} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe optimal global alignment score is the value in the bottom-right cell, $F(m,n) = F(5,4) = 2$.\n\n**Traceback for Optimal Alignment Path**\n\nWe start at the cell $(m,n)=(5,4)$ and trace back to $(0,0)$ by choosing the predecessor cell that yields the maximum score at each step, following the tie-breaking rule (diagonal > vertical > horizontal).\n\n1.  **At $(5,4)$:** $F(5,4)=2$. $X[5]=\\text{T}, Y[4]=\\text{T}$ (match).\n    *   Diagonal: $F(4,3) + s_{\\text{match}} = 1 + 1 = 2$.

Assume a standard dynamic programming alignment model used in algorithms such as the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), where gaps contribute additively to the overall alignment score according to an affine gap penalty scheme. The affine model imposes a single gap-opening penalty $g_o$ and a per-residue gap-extension penalty $g_e$ for each additional residue in the same gap. Suppose the scoring scheme uses $g_o = -5$ and $g_e = -1$, and ignore all substitution contributions so that only the gap contributions are compared across encodings.\n\nStarting from the definition of the affine gap penalty as a one-time gap-opening cost plus a per-residue cost for extending the same gap, derive expressions for the alignment-score contribution under two alternative encodings of the same biological event: (i) a single gap of length $10$ and (ii) ten distinct single-residue gaps separated such that each incurs a new opening.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, providing all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in applying the affine gap penalty model to calculate and compare alignment scores for two different representations of a deletion. The affine gap penalty for a single gap of length $k$ is defined as a one-time gap-opening penalty plus a per-residue penalty for extending the gap. Based on the phrasing \"a per-residue gap-extension penalty $g_e$ for each additional residue in the same gap,\" the score contribution $S_{\\text{gap}}(k)$ for a gap of length $k \\ge 1$ is most accurately modeled as:\n$$S_{\\text{gap}}(k) = g_o + (k-1)g_e$$\nThis formula captures the single opening cost $g_o$ for creating the gap, and the extension cost $g_e$ applied to the $k-1$ residues after the first one.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Gap-opening penalty: $g_o = -5$\n- Gap-extension penalty: $g_e = -1$\n- Deletion length: $10$ base pairs\n\nWe will now calculate the score contribution for the two specified encodings.\n\n(i) A single gap of length $10$:\nIn this case, we have one contiguous gap with length $k=10$. The score contribution, denoted as $S_{\\text{single}}$, is calculated using the affine gap penalty formula with $k=10$:\n$$S_{\\text{single}} = S_{\\text{gap}}(10) = g_o + (10-1)g_e = g_o + 9g_e$$\nSubstituting the given values for $g_o$ and $g_e$:\n$$S_{\\text{single}} = -5 + 9(-1) = -5 - 9 = -14$$\n\n(ii) Ten distinct single-residue gaps:\nIn this scenario, the $10$-base-pair deletion is represented as $10$ separate gaps, each of length $k=1$. First, we calculate the score for a single gap of length $k=1$:\n$$S_{\\text{gap}}(1) = g_o + (1-1)g_e = g_o + 0 \\cdot g_e = g_o$$\nSince there are ten such independent gaps, the total score contribution, denoted as $S_{\\text{multiple}}$, is the sum of the scores of these ten gaps:\n$$S_{\\text{multiple}} = 10 \\times S_{\\text{gap}}(1) = 10 \\times g_o$$\nSubstituting the given value for $g_o$:\n$$S_{\\text{multiple}} = 10 \\times (-5) = -50$$\n\nThe problem asks for the score difference $\\Delta$, defined as the score of the single $10$-residue gap minus the total score of the ten single-residue gaps.\n$$\\Delta = S_{\\text{single}} - S_{\\text{multiple}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated scores:\n$$\\Delta = -14 - (-50) = -14 + 50 = 36$$\n\nThe positive value of $\\Delta$ indicates that the score for the single, contiguous gap ($S_{\\text{single}} = -14$) is significantly higher (i.e., less penalized) than the score for ten separate single-base gaps ($S_{\\text{multiple}} = -50$). Alignment algorithms, such as those used in BLAST and other tools for genomic analysis, are designed to find the alignment with the maximum possible score. Therefore, the affine gap penalty model strongly favors the representation of the deletion as a single, contiguous event.\n\nThis preference is biologically appropriate for modeling insertion-deletion (indel) events. A multi-base-pair indel, such as the $10$-bp deletion described, is overwhelmingly more likely to arise from a single mutational event (e.g., slipped-strand mispairing during DNA replication or an error in DNA double-strand break repair) than from ten independent, single-base-pair deletion events occurring coincidentally at adjacent positions. The affine gap penalty model is specifically designed to reflect this biological reality by imposing a large penalty for initiating a new gap ($g_o$) but a smaller penalty for extending an existing one ($g_e$). This ensures that the alignment algorithm correctly identifies and scores a single large deletion as one event, which is crucial for the accurate characterization of clinically significant variants like frameshift mutations in cancer-related genes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{36}$$", "id": "4379482"}, {"introduction": "A raw alignment score is not universally comparable; its significance depends on the scoring system and database size.

Consider a local alignment between a query of length $m$ and a database of total length $n$, generating a raw alignment score $S$ under a standard substitution matrix and affine gap penalties.

It is scientifically grounded in the Karlin-Altschul statistics fundamental to sequence alignment analysis. It is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, variables ($m$, $n$, $S$, $E$, $K$, $\\lambda$), and constants for a complete derivation and calculation. The language is objective and the tasks are clearly specified. No flaws related to scientific soundness, formalizability, completeness, or objectivity were identified.\n\nThe derivation of the bit score begins with the foundational relationship for the expected number of alignments ($E$-value) with a score of at least $S$:\n$$E \\approx K m n \\exp(-\\lambda S)$$\nHere, $m$ is the query length, $n$ is the database length, $S$ is the raw alignment score, and $K$ and $\\lambda$ are statistical parameters of the scoring system.\n\nThe objective is to derive a normalized score, the bit score $S'$, that is independent of the search space size, which is proportional to the product $mn$. This new score should reflect the intrinsic strength of the alignment itself. The bit score is defined such that the $E$-value can be expressed in a base-$2$ framework, separating the search space size from the score-dependent term. Specifically, the relationship is defined as:\n$$E = m n \\cdot 2^{-S'}$$\nThis form shows that the expected number of hits is the size of the search space ($mn$) multiplied by the probability ($2^{-S'}$) of a hit of a certain quality, where the quality is now measured in \"bits\" by $S'$.\n\nTo find the expression for $S'$ in terms of the raw score $S$, we equate the two expressions for the $E$-value:\n$$K m n \\exp(-\\lambda S) = m n \\cdot 2^{-S'}$$\nThe terms $m$ and $n$ cancel from both sides, which is the key to isolating a quantity independent of the sequence lengths:\n$$K \\exp(-\\lambda S) = 2^{-S'}$$\nTo solve for $S'$, we can take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides of the equation:\n$$\\ln(K \\exp(-\\lambda S)) = \\ln(2^{-S'})$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln(ab) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$ and $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$, we get:\n$$\\ln(K) + \\ln(\\exp(-\\lambda S)) = -S' \\ln(2)$$\n$$\\ln(K) - \\lambda S = -S' \\ln(2)$$\nFinally, solving for the bit score $S'$ yields:\n$$S' = \\frac{-(\\ln(K) - \\lambda S)}{\\ln(2)} = \\frac{\\lambda S - \\ln(K)}{\\ln(2)}$$\nThis is the expression for the base-$2$ normalized bit score.\n\nExamining the derived expression, $S' = (\\lambda S - \\ln(K)) / \\ln(2)$, demonstrates that the bit score depends only on the raw score $S$ and the statistical parameters $\\lambda$ and $K$. Since $S$ is the score of a specific local alignment and $\\lambda$ and $K$ are constants for a given scoring matrix and background residue composition, the bit score $S'$ does not depend on the overall query length $m$ or the total database size $n$.\n\nNext, we compute the bit score for the given clinical alignment parameters: $\\lambda = 0.267$, $K = 0.041$, and a raw score $S = 70$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$S' = \\frac{(0.267)(70) - \\ln(0.041)}{\\ln(2)}$$\nFirst, calculate the terms in the numerator:\nThe product $\\lambda S$ is:\n$$(0.267)(70) = 18.69$$\nThe natural logarithm of $K$ is:\n$$\\ln(0.041) \\approx -3.1941824$$\nThe denominator is the natural logarithm of $2$:\n$$\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69314718$$\nNow, substitute these values back into the expression for $S'$:\n$$S' = \\frac{18.69 - (-3.1941824)}{0.69314718} = \\frac{18.69 + 3.1941824}{0.69314718} = \\frac{21.8841824}{0.69314718}$$\n$$S' \\approx 31.57134$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $31.57$.\n\nFinally, the interpretation of the bit score's utility is rooted in its independence from database size. The $E$-value, $E = mn \\cdot 2^{-S'}$, is directly proportional to the search space size ($mn$). This means that for a fixed raw score $S$ (and thus a fixed bit score $S'$), a search against a larger database (larger $n$) will result in a larger (less significant) $E$-value. The bit score, however, remains constant for that alignment. By factoring out the database size dependency, the bit score provides a standardized measure of alignment quality. This allows for the direct and fair comparison of alignment strengths from different searches, for example, an alignment found in a small, targeted gene panel versus one found by searching the entire human genome. A higher bit score consistently indicates a more statistically significant alignment, irrespective of the context of the search, making it an indispensable metric in genomics and precision medicine for prioritizing findings.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{31.57}$$", "id": "4379365"}]}
