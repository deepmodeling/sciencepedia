Disentangling these complex technical artifacts is a critical skill for ensuring the integrity and accuracy of clinical genomic tests.", "problem": "In a multiplexed Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) workflow for precision oncology, you are asked to investigate unexpected low-level variant signals appearing in samples that should not contain those variants. The facility uses patterned flow cells with exclusion amplification and performs sequencing-by-synthesis with index reads for sample demultiplexing. Multiplexing relies on synthetic index oligonucleotides attached during library preparation; each library is assigned one or more index sequences, and read assignment is performed by exact or near-exact index matching during demultiplexing. From first principles, note that sample identity in multiplexed NGS rests on the accurate association of sequence fragments to their intended index sequences, and that errors in this association can arise either from pre-sequencing mixing of molecules or from mis-assignment processes during cluster generation or instrument operation. Consider the following controlled study.\n\nA cohort of tumor and matched normal libraries is sequenced across $R=3$ runs on the same instrument. Run $1$ uses single indexing, Run $2$ uses Unique Dual Indexing (UDI), and Run $3$ uses UDI but is performed after an abbreviated instrument wash. Each run has $L=4$ lanes. Libraries are pooled at equimolar ratios and spiked with $1$ Population Reference In Error (PhiX) control for calibration. For simplicity, assume lane loading is balanced such that in some lanes, sample $B$ is present, and in other lanes, sample $B$ is absent. Variant $V_{B}$ is a private single-nucleotide variant (SNV) present only in sample $B$ at a true clonal fraction of $100\\%$ in $B$ and $0\\%$ in all other samples at the biological level. Observations:\n\n- In Run $1$ (single index), when samples $A$ and $B$ are co-loaded in a lane, sample $A$ shows $f_{1} \\approx 0.006$ of reads carrying $V_{B}$, but when $B$ is absent from a lane, $f_{1} \\approx 0.000$. Across different lanes in the same run, $f_{1}$ is nonzero only in lanes that contain $B$.\n- In Run $2$ (UDI), with the same pooling design, sample $A$ shows $f_{2} \\approx 0.0002$ of reads carrying $V_{B}$ in lanes containing $B$, and $f_{2} \\approx 0.000$ in lanes without $B$.\n- In Run $3$ (UDI, abbreviated wash), sample $C$—which was present only in Run $2$—produces reads with its distinctive index pair and multiple private variants appearing across all lanes despite sample $C$ not being loaded in Run $3$. The fraction is approximately $f_{3} \\approx 0.0005$ in each lane of Run $3$, independent of which samples are present in those lanes.\n- Separately, a particular library $D$ (prepared twice independently from the same biospecimen with fresh indexing oligos) shows variant $V_{X}$ at $f_{4} \\approx 0.05$ in both Run $2$ and Run $3$, on different instruments and lanes, with no dependence on which other samples are co-loaded.\n\nSuppose the probability that an index becomes reassigned within a lane due to free adapters during patterned flow cell clustering is $p$, and that in UDI the probability that both index reads jointly yield a valid index pair assigned to the wrong sample scales approximately as $p^{2}$ under independence, while physical mixing of molecules upstream of indexing induces a true mixture fraction that persists across instruments and runs. Using these premises and the observations above, choose the statement(s) that correctly define the phenomena and distinguish within-lane index hopping from cross-run carryover contamination in this study.\n\nA. The nonzero $f_{1}$ only in lanes containing sample $B$ and its strong reduction to $f_{2}$ with Unique Dual Indexing is characteristic of index cross-talk via within-lane index hopping; mitigation includes reducing free adapter concentration and using UDI, and the effect should not appear in lanes where $B$ is absent.\n\nB. The appearance of sample $C$’s reads in Run $3$ at approximately uniform $f_{3}$ across all lanes despite being absent from Run $3$ is characteristic of cross-run carryover contamination (instrument memory), which is distinguished from within-lane index hopping by persistence across runs and independence from lane co-loading; mitigation includes thorough instrument wash protocols and fluidics replacement.\n\nC. The persistent $f_{4} \\approx 0.05$ signal for variant $V_{X}$ in library $D$ across different runs, lanes, and instruments indicates sample contamination upstream of indexing (true molecular mixture), which will not be resolved by changing index design or instrument wash; mitigation requires re-extraction and stricter pre-PCR cleanroom practices.\n\nD. The Run $1$ pattern is more consistent with base-calling errors due to phasing and pre-phasing during sequencing-by-synthesis, because such errors selectively inject private variants from a specific co-loaded sample into another within the same lane; mitigation is to increase cycle-specific phasing correction rather than altering indexing strategy.\n\nE. The reduction of $f_{2}$ in Run $2$ proves that UDI eliminates cross-run carryover contamination and thus any signal like $f_{3}$ must be due solely to base-calling errors; therefore enhanced computational demultiplexing is sufficient to prevent such contamination without instrument wash.\n\nSelect all that apply.", "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of four distinct observations ($f_1$, $f_2$, $f_3$, $f_4$) to identify the underlying causes of anomalous variant signals in a multiplexed NGS study.\n\nThe signature of $f_1$ and $f_2$ is characteristic of **within-lane index hopping**. The signal appears only when the source sample ($B$) is co-loaded in the same lane, and it is dramatically reduced by switching from single indexing (SI) to Unique Dual Indexing (UDI). This points to a process occurring on the flow cell that is mitigated by a stricter indexing scheme.\n\nThe signature of $f_3$ is characteristic of **cross-run carryover contamination**. Reads from a sample in a previous run ($C$ in Run 2) appear in all lanes of the subsequent run (Run 3) despite not being loaded. This is independent of co-loading within Run 3 and is explained by the \"abbreviated instrument wash,\" which failed to clear residual molecules from the instrument's fluidics.\n\nThe signature of $f_4$ is characteristic of **pre-analytical sample contamination**. A signal appears at a relatively high and stable fraction ($\\approx 5\\%$) that is independent of all sequencing parameters (run, lane, instrument, co-loading). This indicates a true molecular mixture that existed in the source material before any sequencing libraries were prepared.\n\nBased on this analysis:\n-   **A is correct.** It accurately describes the signature and mitigation of within-lane index hopping observed for $f_1$ and $f_2$.\n-   **B is correct.** It accurately describes the signature and mitigation of cross-run carryover contamination observed for $f_3$.\n-   **C is correct.** It accurately describes the signature and mitigation for the pre-analytical contamination observed for $f_4$.\n-   **D is incorrect.** Phasing errors are not the primary cause of index mis-assignment and would not be fixed by switching to UDI.\n-   **E is incorrect.** It conflates index hopping with carryover and incorrectly suggests a computational fix for a physical contamination problem.\n\nThus, statements A, B, and C correctly define the phenomena.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "4353892"}]}
