The answer is unitless.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimum number of independent preclinical edits, $n$, that must be conducted without any observed severe off-target events ($k=0$) to satisfy a specific ethical safety criterion. This criterion is formulated within a Bayesian statistical framework.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Formulation and Model Specification\nThe problem defines the unknown probability of a severe off-target event as $p$. The data-generating process is a series of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial results in an off-target event with probability $p$. The number of observed events, $k$, in $n$ trials follows a Binomial distribution, with the likelihood function given by:\n$$ L(p \\mid k, n) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$\nThe prior belief about the parameter $p$ is modeled by a Beta distribution, $p \\sim \\text{Beta}(\\alpha_0, \\beta_0)$. The probability density function (PDF) of the prior is:\n$$ f(p; \\alpha_0, \\beta_0) = \\frac{p^{\\alpha_0-1}(1-p)^{\\beta_0-1}}{B(\\alpha_0, \\beta_0)} $$\nwhere $B(\\alpha_0, \\beta_0)$ is the Beta function. We are given the prior parameters $\\alpha_0=1$ and $\\beta_0=1$, which corresponds to a uniform distribution on the interval $[0,1]$, expressing maximal prior uncertainty about $p$.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Posterior Distribution\nThe Beta distribution is a conjugate prior for the Bernoulli/Binomial likelihood. This means that the posterior distribution of $p$, given the data $(k, n)$, is also a Beta distribution. The posterior PDF is proportional to the product of the prior PDF and the likelihood function:\n$$ f(p \\mid k, n) \\propto L(p \\mid k, n) \\times f(p; \\alpha_0, \\beta_0) $$\n$$ f(p \\mid k, n) \\propto p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\times p^{\\alpha_0-1}(1-p)^{\\beta_0-1} $$\n$$ f(p \\mid k, n) \\propto p^{\\alpha_0+k-1} (1-p)^{\\beta_0+n-k-1} $$\nThis is the kernel of a Beta distribution with updated parameters $\\alpha_{\\text{post}} = \\alpha_0 + k$ and $\\beta_{\\text{post}} = \\beta_0 + n - k$. Thus, the posterior distribution is:\n$$ p \\mid k,n \\sim \\text{Beta}(\\alpha_0 + k, \\beta_0 + n - k) $$\nThe problem specifies that no severe off-target events are observed, so $k=0$. Substituting the given values $\\alpha_0=1$, $\\beta_0=1$, and $k=0$, the posterior parameters become:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{post}} = 1 + 0 = 1 $$\n$$ \\beta_{\\text{post}} = 1 + n - 0 = n + 1 $$\nTherefore, the posterior distribution of $p$ is $p \\mid k=0, n \\sim \\text{Beta}(1, n+1)$.\n\n### Step 3: Application of the Ethical Policy Criterion\nThe ethical policy requires that the posterior probability of safety, defined as $p \\leq \\theta$, must be greater than $0.95$. The safety threshold is given as $\\theta = 0.01$. Mathematically, this condition is:\n$$ \\Pr(p \\leq \\theta \\mid k=0, n) > 0.95 $$\nThis probability is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the posterior distribution, $\\text{Beta}(1, n+1)$, evaluated at $p=\\theta$. The CDF of a Beta distribution $\\text{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta)$ is given by the integral:\n$$ F(x; \\alpha, \\beta) = \\int_0^x \\frac{t^{\\alpha-1}(1-t)^{\\beta-1}}{B(\\alpha, \\beta)} dt $$\nFor our posterior distribution $\\text{Beta}(1, n+1)$ and threshold $\\theta=0.01$, this becomes:\n$$ \\Pr(p \\leq 0.01 \\mid k=0, n) = \\int_0^{0.01} \\frac{t^{1-1}(1-t)^{(n+1)-1}}{B(1, n+1)} dt = \\frac{1}{B(1, n+1)} \\int_0^{0.01} (1-t)^n dt $$\nFirst, we evaluate the Beta function $B(1, n+1) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1)\\Gamma(n+1)}{\\Gamma(1+n+1)} = \\frac{0! \\cdot n!}{(n+1)!} = \\frac{1}{n+1}$, where $\\Gamma$ is the Gamma function.\nNext, we evaluate the integral:\n$$ \\int_0^{0.01} (1-t)^n dt = \\left[ -\\frac{(1-t)^{n+1}}{n+1} \\right]_0^{0.01} = \\left(-\\frac{(1-0.01)^{n+1}}{n+1}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{(1-0)^{n+1}}{n+1}\\right) = \\frac{1 - (0.99)^{n+1}}{n+1} $$\nCombining these results, the posterior probability is:\n$$ \\Pr(p \\leq 0.01 \\mid k=0, n) = (n+1) \\times \\left( \\frac{1 - (0.99)^{n+1}}{n+1} \\right) = 1 - (0.99)^{n+1} $$\n\n### Step 4: Solving for the Minimal Number of Edits, n\nWe must find the minimal integer $n$ that satisfies the inequality derived from the policy criterion:\n$$ 1 - (0.99)^{n+1} > 0.95 $$\nRearranging the inequality:\n$$ 0.05 > (0.99)^{n+1} $$\nTo solve for $n$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. Since the natural logarithm is a strictly increasing function, the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n$$ \\ln(0.05) > \\ln\\left((0.99)^{n+1}\\right) $$\n$$ \\ln(0.05) > (n+1) \\ln(0.99) $$\nThe value of $\\ln(0.99)$ is negative because its argument is less than $1$. Therefore, dividing by $\\ln(0.99)$ reverses the direction of the inequality:\n$$ \\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(0.99)} < n+1 $$\nSolving for $n$:\n$$ n > \\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(0.99)} - 1 $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the right-hand side:\n$$ \\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(0.99)} \\approx \\frac{-2.99573}{-0.01005} \\approx 298.08 $$\nSo the inequality becomes:\n$$ n > 298.08 - 1 $$\n$$ n > 297.08 $$\nSince $n$ must be an integer representing the number of edits, the minimal integer $n$ that satisfies this condition is $298$.\nThis means that a minimum of $298$ preclinical edits must be performed with zero observed severe off-target events to meet the consortium's ethical standard for proceeding to first-in-human trials.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{298}$$", "id": "4337748"}, {"introduction": "Once a technology is deemed ready for clinical consideration, each proposed intervention must be weighed on its own merits.

Do not round.", "solution": "The problem asks for two results: first, a general recurrence relation for the deleterious allele frequency, and second, the minimum intervention level $\\alpha$ required to meet a specific target under simplified conditions.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Recurrence Relation for $q_{t+1}$\n\nLet $q_t$ be the frequency of the deleterious allele (let's call it $A$) in the population at generation $t$, just before embryo screening. The frequency of the wild-type allele ($a$) is $p_t = 1 - q_t$. Assuming the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium due to random mating, the genotype frequencies at fertilization are:\n- Homozygous deleterious ($AA$): $f(AA) = q_t^2$\n- Heterozygous ($Aa$): $f(Aa) = 2p_t q_t$\n- Homozygous wild-type ($aa$): $f(aa) = p_t^2$\n\nThe intervention consists of editing a constant fraction $\\alpha$ of \"embryos that carry the allele\". These are the $AA$ and $Aa$ genotypes. We interpret this to mean that any specific carrier embryo has a probability $\\alpha$ of being selected for editing, and if selected, the editing process perfectly converts all its $A$ alleles to $a$ alleles.\n\nLet's calculate the genotype frequencies after this editing step.\nA fraction $\\alpha$ of $AA$ embryos are edited, becoming $aa$. The remaining fraction, $1-\\alpha$, stays as $AA$. The new frequency of $AA$, denoted $f'(AA)$, is:\n$$f'(AA) = (1-\\alpha) f(AA) = (1-\\alpha)q_t^2$$\nSimilarly, a fraction $\\alpha$ of $Aa$ embryos are edited. Since editing is perfect, they also become $aa$. The remaining fraction, $1-\\alpha$, stays as $Aa$. The new frequency of $Aa$, denoted $f'(Aa)$, is:\n$$f'(Aa) = (1-\\alpha) f(Aa) = (1-\\alpha)2p_t q_t$$\nThe original $aa$ embryos are untouched. The embryos converted from $AA$ and $Aa$ are added to this pool. The new frequency of $aa$, $f'(aa)$, is:\n$$f'(aa) = f(aa) + \\alpha f(AA) + \\alpha f(Aa) = p_t^2 + \\alpha q_t^2 + \\alpha 2p_t q_t$$\nThe sum of new frequencies is $f'(AA) + f'(Aa) + f'(aa) = (1-\\alpha)q_t^2 + (1-\\alpha)2p_t q_t + p_t^2 + \\alpha q_t^2 + \\alpha 2p_t q_t = q_t^2 + 2p_t q_t + p_t^2 = (q_t+p_t)^2 = 1^2 = 1$, which confirms the calculation is consistent.\n\nNow, we find the frequency of the deleterious allele $A$ immediately after editing, let's call it $q_t'$. This is calculated from the new genotype frequencies:\n$$q_t' = f'(AA) + \\frac{1}{2}f'(Aa)$$\n$$q_t' = (1-\\alpha)q_t^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\alpha)2p_t q_t$$\n$$q_t' = (1-\\alpha)q_t^2 + (1-\\alpha)p_t q_t$$\nFactoring out $(1-\\alpha)$ and $q_t$:\n$$q_t' = (1-\\alpha)q_t (q_t + p_t)$$\nSince $q_t + p_t = 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$q_t' = (1-\\alpha)q_t$$\nThis is a linear relationship, as suggested by the problem statement. The frequency of the wild-type allele after editing is $p_t' = 1 - q_t' = 1 - (1-\\alpha)q_t$.\n\nThe second process is de novo mutation, which occurs at a rate $\\mu$ from the wild-type allele $a$ to the deleterious allele $A$. This happens to the post-editing allele pool before the next generation's allele frequency is established. The frequency of allele $A$ in generation $t+1$, denoted $q_{t+1}$, is the sum of the deleterious alleles that survived editing plus the new deleterious alleles created by mutation from wild-type alleles.\n$$q_{t+1} = q_t' + \\mu p_t'$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $q_t'$ and $p_t'$:\n$$q_{t+1} = (1-\\alpha)q_t + \\mu (1 - (1-\\alpha)q_t)$$\n$$q_{t+1} = (1-\\alpha)q_t + \\mu - \\mu(1-\\alpha)q_t$$\nGrouping terms with $q_t$:\n$$q_{t+1} = [(1-\\alpha) - \\mu(1-\\alpha)]q_t + \\mu$$\n$$q_{t+1} = (1-\\alpha)(1-\\mu)q_t + \\mu$$\nThis is the required first-order linear recurrence relation for $q_{t+1}$.\n\n### Part 2: Determination of the Smallest Intervention Fraction $\\alpha$\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we are instructed to set the mutation rate to zero, i.e., $\\mu=0$. The recurrence relation simplifies considerably:\n$$q_{t+1} = (1-\\alpha)(1-0)q_t + 0$$\n$$q_{t+1} = (1-\\alpha)q_t$$\nThis is a standard geometric decay model. We can express the allele frequency at any generation $t$ in terms of the initial frequency $q_0$ by applying the recurrence iteratively:\n$$q_1 = (1-\\alpha)q_0$$\n$$q_2 = (1-\\alpha)q_1 = (1-\\alpha)^2 q_0$$\nBy induction, the frequency at generation $T$ is:\n$$q_T = (1-\\alpha)^T q_0$$\nThe public health target is to reduce the allele frequency from $q_0$ to at most $q_f$ within exactly $T$ generations. This translates to the mathematical condition:\n$$q_T \\leq q_f$$\nSubstituting our expression for $q_T$:\n$$(1-\\alpha)^T q_0 \\leq q_f$$\nWe must solve for $\\alpha$. Since $q_0 > 0$, we can divide by $q_0$:\n$$(1-\\alpha)^T \\leq \\frac{q_f}{q_0}$$\nGiven that $T \\in \\mathbb{N}$ ($T \\geq 1$), and that $0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq 1$ and $0 < q_f < q_0$, both sides of the inequality are positive. We can take the $T$-th root of both sides without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$1-\\alpha \\leq \\left(\\frac{q_f}{q_0}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{T}}$$\nNow, we isolate $\\alpha$:\n$$-\\alpha \\leq \\left(\\frac{q_f}{q_0}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{T}} - 1$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality:\n$$\\alpha \\geq 1 - \\left(\\frac{q_f}{q_0}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{T}}$$\nThe problem asks for the smallest constant fraction $\\alpha$ that will meet the target. This minimum value is achieved when the equality holds. Any smaller value of $\\alpha$ would result in $q_T > q_f$, failing to meet the goal. Therefore, the exact smallest value for $\\alpha$ is:\n$$\\alpha = 1 - \\left(\\frac{q_f}{q_0}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{T}}$$\nThis expression is in terms of the given parameters $q_0$, $q_f$, and $T$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1 - \\left(\\frac{q_f}{q_0}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{T}}}\n$$", "id": "4337737"}]}
