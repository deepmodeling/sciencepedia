This exercise focuses on the critical task of distinguishing between standard Protected Health Information (PHI) and the specially protected category of \"psychotherapy notes\" within a realistic genetic medicine context. Mastering this distinction is fundamental, as misclassification can lead to significant compliance failures and privacy violations [@problem_id:4349000].", "problem": "An academic precision medicine clinic integrates clinical genomics into oncology care and operates as a covered entity under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The clinic maintains distinct documentation artifacts arising from patient encounters that include pre-test and post-test genetic counseling as well as psychological adjustment support in response to inherited risk findings. The clinic’s governance committee seeks to standardize how each artifact is classified and handled.\n\nFoundational definitions known to the committee include: Protected Health Information (PHI) is individually identifiable health information; a Designated Record Set (DRS) includes medical and billing records used to make decisions about individuals; psychotherapy notes are the personal notes of a mental health professional documenting or analyzing the contents of a counseling session and maintained separate from the medical record; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) permits uses and disclosures without authorization for treatment, payment, and health care operations; the minimum necessary standard applies to most uses and disclosures except for treatment; genetic information includes genetic test results and family history; the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) is implemented under HIPAA to prohibit health plans from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting.\n\nThe clinic currently produces two distinct documentation artifacts for a patient enrolled in a tumor-normal sequencing protocol:\n- Psychological Adjustment Process Notes: recorded by a licensed clinical psychologist who provides psychotherapy focused on coping with hereditary cancer risk and the psychological response to uncertain genomic findings. These notes analyze the content of private psychotherapy sessions and are maintained in a separate repository, segregated from the Electronic Health Record (EHR).\n- Genetic Counseling Clinical Summary: recorded by a board-certified genetic counselor in the EHR, containing family pedigree, personal and family history, genetic test orders and results, risk assessments, start and stop times of encounters, modalities and frequencies of counseling sessions, clinical recommendations, and follow-up plans.\n\nConsider the following statements about how HIPAA applies to these artifacts and related uses:\n\nA. The Psychological Adjustment Process Notes qualify as psychotherapy notes under HIPAA; they generally require a separate, specific authorization for most uses and disclosures, are excluded from the individual’s right of access, and must be kept separate from the EHR to retain their status as psychotherapy notes.\n\nB. The Genetic Counseling Clinical Summary qualifies as psychotherapy notes because it analyzes counseling content; therefore, it cannot be used or disclosed for treatment, payment, or health care operations without the individual’s specific authorization.\n\nC. Genetic information in the Genetic Counseling Clinical Summary is PHI and therefore subject to the minimum necessary standard when disclosed for treatment among covered providers.\n\nD. A covered health plan is prohibited from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting purposes under HIPAA’s implementation of GINA, regardless of whether the genetic information is derived from sequencing or family history.\n\nE. A researcher within the same covered entity may use identifiable genetic information from the Genetic Counseling Clinical Summary for research without authorization if an Institutional Review Board (IRB) grants a waiver of authorization; however, psychotherapy notes cannot be accessed for research under such a waiver and still require the individual’s authorization unless a specific HIPAA exception applies.\n\nSelect all statements that are correct.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the legal and regulatory principles of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a realistic scenario in precision medicine that allows for a rigorous application of the provided definitions.\n\nThe task is to evaluate the correctness of five statements (A, B, C, D, E) concerning the handling of two types of clinical documentation under HIPAA rules. The two artifacts are:\n1.  Psychological Adjustment Process Notes.\n2.  Genetic Counseling Clinical Summary.\n\nThe evaluation will proceed by analyzing each statement against the foundational definitions provided.\n\n**Analysis of Statement A**\n\n**Evaluation:** This statement contains four distinct claims that must be validated against the provided definition of psychotherapy notes: \"the personal notes of a mental health professional documenting or analyzing the contents of a counseling session and maintained separate from the medical record.\"\n\n1.  **Qualification as Psychotherapy Notes:** The \"Psychological Adjustment Process Notes\" are recorded by a \"licensed clinical psychologist\" (a mental health professional), \"analyze the content of private psychotherapy sessions,\" and are \"maintained in a separate repository, segregated from the Electronic Health Record (EHR)\". These attributes perfectly match the definition of psychotherapy notes provided. This claim is correct.\n\n2.  **Requirement for Authorization:** HIPAA provides heightened protection for psychotherapy notes. Unlike general Protected Health Information (PHI), their use or disclosure, even for treatment, payment, or health care operations (TPO), requires a specific written authorization from the individual, with few exceptions. This claim is correct (per $45$ CFR $§164.508(a)(2)$).\n\n3.  **Exclusion from Right of Access:** The HIPAA Privacy Rule grants individuals a right to access and obtain copies of their PHI contained within a Designated Record Set (DRS). However, it explicitly excludes psychotherapy notes from this right of access. This claim is correct (per $45$ CFR $§164.524(a)(1)(i)$).\n\n4.  **Separation from the EHR:** The definition itself requires that psychotherapy notes be \"maintained separate from the medical record.\" If these notes were integrated into the main patient chart (the EHR), they would lose their special status and become part of the DRS, subject to the general rules for PHI. Therefore, keeping them separate is a condition for retaining their status. This claim is correct.\n\nSince all four claims within the statement are accurate, the entire statement is correct.\n\n**Verdict:** **Correct**\n\n**Analysis of Statement B**\n\n**Statement:** The Genetic Counseling Clinical Summary qualifies as psychotherapy notes because it analyzes counseling content; therefore, it cannot be used or disclosed for treatment, payment, or health care operations without the individual’s specific authorization.\n\n**Evaluation:** This statement's validity hinges on its initial premise: that the \"Genetic Counseling Clinical Summary\" qualifies as psychotherapy notes.\n\nLet's test this premise against the definition.\n- **Maintained Separate:** The problem states that the summary is \"recorded by a board-certified genetic counselor **in the EHR**.\" This directly violates the definitional requirement that psychotherapy notes be \"maintained separate from the medical record.\"\n- **Content:** The summary contains a wide range of clinical data, such as \"family pedigree... genetic test orders and results, risk assessments... clinical recommendations, and follow-up plans.\" This information is integral to the patient's medical record and is used to \"make decisions about individuals,\" making it part of the Designated Record Set, not private analysis notes.\n- **Provider Type:** While a genetic counselor provides counseling, they are not typically classified as a \"mental health professional\" in the same sense as a psychologist or psychiatrist under the narrow HIPAA definition.\n\nThe premise that the summary qualifies as psychotherapy notes is false, primarily because it is part of the EHR. Consequently, the conclusion that it cannot be used for TPO without authorization is also false. As part of the standard medical record, this PHI *can* be used and disclosed for TPO purposes without a separate patient authorization.\n\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**\n\n**Analysis of Statement C**\n\n**Statement:** Genetic information in the Genetic Counseling Clinical Summary is PHI and therefore subject to the minimum necessary standard when disclosed for treatment among covered providers.\n\n**Evaluation:** This statement has two parts.\n\n1.  **Genetic Information as PHI:** The summary contains individually identifiable information such as \"genetic test orders and results\" and \"family history.\" According to the provided definition, this is a form of PHI. This part of the statement is correct.\n\n2.  **Application of Minimum Necessary Standard to Treatment:** The statement claims this PHI is subject to the \"minimum necessary standard\" when disclosed for \"treatment.\" However, the provided foundational definitions explicitly state: \"the minimum necessary standard applies to most uses and disclosures **except for treatment**.\" Disclosures of PHI from one provider to another for treatment purposes are a specific and critical exception to the minimum necessary rule.\n\nBecause the second part of the statement misrepresents a fundamental rule of HIPAA, the entire statement is flawed.\n\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**\n\n**Analysis of Statement D**\n\n**Statement:** A covered health plan is prohibited from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting purposes under HIPAA’s implementation of GINA, regardless of whether the genetic information is derived from sequencing or family history.\n\n**Evaluation:** Let's break this down.\n\n1.  **Prohibition:** The foundational definitions state, \"the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) is implemented under HIPAA to prohibit health plans from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting.\" This directly supports the core of the statement. \"Underwriting\" includes using information to make decisions about eligibility, coverage, or premium setting.\n\n2.  **Scope of \"Genetic Information\":** The statement specifies the prohibition applies regardless of whether the source is \"sequencing or family history.\" The provided definition of \"genetic information\" explicitly \"includes genetic test results and family history.\"\n\nThe statement accurately describes the prohibition set forth by GINA Title I, which is enforced via the HIPAA Privacy Rule. It correctly identifies the regulated entity (health plan), the prohibited activity (use for underwriting), and the broad scope of protected information.\n\n**Verdict:** **Correct**\n\n**Analysis of Statement E**\n\n**Statement:** A researcher within the same covered entity may use identifiable genetic information from the Genetic Counseling Clinical Summary for research without authorization if an Institutional Review Board (IRB) grants a waiver of authorization; however, psychotherapy notes cannot be accessed for research under such a waiver and still require the individual’s authorization unless a specific HIPAA exception applies.\n\n**Evaluation:** This statement compares the rules for research use of general PHI versus psychotherapy notes.\n\n1.  **Research on General PHI:** The \"Genetic Counseling Clinical Summary\" is part of the medical record and contains PHI. The HIPAA Privacy Rule permits the use or disclosure of PHI for research without an individual's authorization if an IRB or Privacy Board grants a waiver of that authorization (per $45$ CFR $§164.512(i)$). The first part of the statement is correct. The fact that the researcher is \"within the same covered entity\" means this is a \"use\" of PHI, which is still governed by this rule.\n\n2.  **Research on Psychotherapy Notes:** The rule changes dramatically for psychotherapy notes. The specific provision allowing for an IRB waiver of authorization ($45$ CFR $§164.512(i)$) does **not** apply to psychotherapy notes. Any use or disclosure of psychotherapy notes for research purposes requires a specific, explicit authorization from the individual (per $45$ CFR $§164.508(a)(2)$). The extremely narrow exceptions to this authorization requirement do not generally cover research activities facilitated by an IRB waiver. Therefore, the second part of the statement, which contrasts this with the first part, is also correct.\n\nThe statement correctly differentiates the stringent requirements for using psychotherapy notes in research from the less stringent, though still regulated, requirements for using general PHI.\n\n**Verdict:** **Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ADE}$$", "id": "4349000"}, {"introduction": "When a data security incident occurs, a swift and systematic response is crucial. This practice problem simulates a data breach scenario, guiding you through the two core components of the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule: performing a quantitative risk assessment to determine if notification is required, and calculating the final deadline based on complex regulatory timelines. This exercise builds practical skills in translating abstract risk principles into concrete, time-sensitive compliance actions [@problem_id:4348989].", "problem": "A precision medicine clinic that is a Covered Entity (CE) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is conducting a whole-genome sequencing program. A misdirected email incident exposed a dataset containing Protected Health Information (PHI) for $1200$ participants, including full names, dates of birth, medical record numbers, and variant call files. The email contained a secure link to the dataset that expired after $48$ hours. The recipient was a genomics professor at a public university who is not a Business Associate (BA) of the CE. The recipient later provided a written attestation of deletion. The CE’s email gateway logged that the link was accessed, but not whether files were fully downloaded. A Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system flagged the incident for the CE’s compliance team.\n\nThe CE’s internal quantitative risk framework, aligned to the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule’s four-factor risk assessment (nature and extent of PHI, the unauthorized person, whether the PHI was actually acquired or viewed, and the extent to which the risk has been mitigated), models the “probability that PHI has been compromised” as the probability that all of the following hold: (i) acquisition or viewing by an unauthorized person occurs, (ii) the PHI is usable/identifiable to that person, and (iii) mitigation does not effectively prevent further use. Formally, if $A$ is “acquired/viewed,” $U$ is “usable/identifiable,” and $M$ is “effective mitigation,” then “compromise” $C$ occurs when $C = A \\cap U \\cap \\neg M$. The CE assumes conditional independence of $A$, $U$, and $M$ for modeling purposes, and uses the following empirically grounded inputs based on logs and recipient characteristics: $\\mathbb{P}(A) = 0.35$ (based on access logs with time-to-live expiration), $\\mathbb{P}(U) = 0.95$ (due to direct identifiers coupled with whole-genome data), and $\\mathbb{P}(M) = 0.60$ (based on attestation, recipient’s institutional policies, and technical controls). The CE’s documented policy defines “low probability” as $\\mathbb{P}(C) < 0.10$.\n\nThe incident timeline is as follows (all days measured from the impermissible disclosure, which occurs on day $0$):\n- Day $5$: The BA’s security monitoring system detects possible exfiltration related to the transmission but does not notify the CE until day $25$.\n- Day $10$: The CE’s DLP system flags the incident with sufficient detail such that, exercising reasonable diligence, the CE would have known of the impermissible disclosure.\n- Day $18$: A CE workforce member becomes actually aware of the misdirected transmission but does not escalate it until day $40$.\n- Day $15$: A Law Enforcement Official (LEO) issues a written request to delay notification for $20$ days on the basis that notification would impede an ongoing investigation.\n\nUnder the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, a breach is presumed unless the four-factor risk assessment demonstrates a low probability that PHI has been compromised, and a breach is treated as “discovered” on the first day it is known, or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to the CE. Notifications to individuals must be provided without unreasonable delay and in no case later than $60$ calendar days following discovery; however, a written LEO delay requires the CE to delay notification for the specified period.\n\nAssuming the CE strictly follows the definitions above and standard rules of probability, determine the last permissible day (counted from day $0$) by which the CE must provide individual notification under HIPAA. If the risk assessment demonstrates a low probability of compromise per the CE’s threshold, then no notification is required and you should return $0$. Otherwise, account for the written LEO delay when computing the latest permissible notification day. Express your final answer as a single real number of days from day $0$. No rounding is required, and the unit is days.", "solution": "The problem is determined to be valid as it is self-contained, internally consistent, and well-posed. It is grounded in the established legal framework of the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule and utilizes a standard quantitative risk assessment model based on probability theory. All necessary data and definitions are provided to derive a unique, verifiable solution.\n\nThe solution process involves two primary steps: first, conducting the risk assessment to determine if the incident qualifies as a reportable breach, and second, if it does, calculating the final notification deadline according to the specified timeline and regulatory constraints.\n\n**Step 1: Breach Risk Assessment**\n\nThe problem defines the event of a compromise of Protected Health Information (PHI), denoted by $C$, as the intersection of three events: the PHI was acquired or viewed ($A$), the PHI is usable or identifiable ($U$), and mitigation efforts were not effective ($\\neg M$). This is formally expressed as:\n$$C = A \\cap U \\cap \\neg M$$\n\nThe problem states that for modeling purposes, the events $A$, $U$, and $M$ are assumed to be conditionally independent. This allows for the calculation of the probability of compromise, $\\mathbb{P}(C)$, by multiplying the probabilities of the constituent events:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(C) = \\mathbb{P}(A) \\times \\mathbb{P}(U) \\times \\mathbb{P}(\\neg M)$$\n\nThe given probabilities are:\n- $\\mathbb{P}(A) = 0.35$\n- $\\mathbb{P}(U) = 0.95$\n- $\\mathbb{P}(M) = 0.60$\n\nThe probability of the complement event $\\neg M$ (ineffective mitigation) is calculated as:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(\\neg M) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(M) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula for $\\mathbb{P}(C)$:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(C) = 0.35 \\times 0.95 \\times 0.40$$\n$$\\mathbb{P}(C) = 0.3325 \\times 0.40$$\n$$\\mathbb{P}(C) = 0.133$$\n\nThe Covered Entity's (CE) policy defines a \"low probability\" of compromise as $\\mathbb{P}(C) < 0.10$. We must compare our calculated probability to this threshold.\nSince $0.133 \\ge 0.10$, the risk assessment does not demonstrate a low probability that the PHI has been compromised. Therefore, under the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, the incident is presumed to be a reportable breach, and notification to the affected individuals is required. The answer is not $0$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculation of the Notification Deadline**\n\nHaving established that notification is required, we must determine the latest permissible date for this notification.\n\nFirst, we identify the \"date of discovery\" of the breach. The rule states this is \"the first day [the breach] is known, or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to the CE\".\nThe timeline provides two relevant events for the CE:\n1.  On day $10$, the CE’s Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system flagged the incident with sufficient detail that the CE \"by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known\" of the disclosure. This represents the date of constructive knowledge.\n2.  On day $18$, a CE workforce member became \"actually aware\" of the disclosure. This represents the date of actual knowledge.\n\nThe date of discovery is the earlier of these two dates. Let $T_{discover}$ be the day of discovery, measured from day $0$.\n$$T_{discover} = \\min(10, 18) = 10$$\nThus, the breach was discovered on day $10$.\n\nNext, we calculate the standard notification deadline. The rule requires notification \"without unreasonable delay and in no case later than $60$ calendar days following discovery\". Let the standard notification period be $T_{period} = 60$ days. The baseline deadline would be:\n$$T_{baseline} = T_{discover} + T_{period} = 10 + 60 = 70 \\text{ days}$$\n\nFinally, we must account for the delay requested by a Law Enforcement Official (LEO). On day $15$, an LEO issued a written request to delay notification for a period of $20$ days. Let this delay period be $T_{delay} = 20$ days. The HIPAA rule mandates that the CE must delay notification for the specified time. This delay extends the final deadline.\n\nThe last permissible day for notification, $T_{final}$, is calculated by adding the LEO delay period to the baseline deadline:\n$$T_{final} = T_{discover} + T_{period} + T_{delay}$$\n$$T_{final} = 10 + 60 + 20$$\n$$T_{final} = 90$$\n\nTherefore, the last permissible day by which the CE must provide individual notification is day $90$, counted from the date of the impermissible disclosure (day $0$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{90}$$", "id": "4348989"}, {"introduction": "Balancing the scientific value of data sharing with the ethical mandate of privacy protection is a central challenge in modern genomics. This advanced practice explores how to achieve this balance by applying the formal guarantees of $\\varepsilon$-differential privacy to satisfy the HIPAA Expert Determination method for de-identification. By working through this problem, you will learn how to connect a rigorous mathematical privacy model to a legal standard, a key skill for responsibly disseminating sensitive data for research and public health [@problem_id:4349009].", "problem": "A precision oncology laboratory affiliated with a covered entity under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) seeks to publicly share the minor allele frequency (MAF) of a single clinically relevant variant, computed from a case cohort of size $n = 10000$. The laboratory will use the Expert Determination method of HIPAA de-identification, adopting as a formal privacy requirement that, for any named individual in the general population, the posterior probability of membership in the released cohort after observing the MAF output must not exceed a threshold $\\tau = 0.1$, given an adversary’s prior membership belief $p = 0.01$. The laboratory plans to release a noisy estimate $\\tilde{f}$ of the true frequency $f = c/n$ (where $c$ is the number of carriers in the cohort) using the Laplace mechanism $\\tilde{f} = f + Z$ with $Z \\sim \\mathrm{Laplace}(0,b)$.\n\nStarting from first principles—namely, the definition of $\\varepsilon$-differential privacy (DP) and Bayes’ theorem—derive the relationship between $\\varepsilon$, the adversary’s prior $p$, and the posterior bound $\\tau$ that enforces the Expert Determination criterion. Then, using the global sensitivity of the frequency function with respect to single-record changes, determine the minimum Laplace noise scale $b$ that satisfies the $\\varepsilon$ bound while preserving as much utility as possible. Provide the final numeric value of $b$ as a unitless quantity and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It poses a valid, solvable problem in the domain of data privacy and statistics. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part derivation. First, we must establish the relationship between the differential privacy parameter $\\varepsilon$, the adversary's prior belief $p$, and the maximum allowable posterior belief $\\tau$. Second, we will use this relationship to find the minimum required scale $b$ for the Laplace mechanism.\n\nLet $M$ be the event that a specific individual is a member of the case cohort. The adversary's prior probability for this event is given as $P(M) = p$. The complementary event, that the individual is not in the cohort, has probability $P(\\neg M) = 1 - p$. The laboratory releases a noisy minor allele frequency (MAF), $\\tilde{f}$, which is the observable evidence for the adversary. The adversary's goal is to compute the posterior probability $P(M | \\tilde{f})$ after observing the output $\\tilde{f}$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is given by:\n$$\nP(M | \\tilde{f}) = \\frac{P(\\tilde{f} | M) P(M)}{P(\\tilde{f})}\n$$\nThe total probability in the denominator can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(\\tilde{f}) = P(\\tilde{f} | M) P(M) + P(\\tilde{f} | \\neg M) P(\\neg M)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Bayes' formula, we get:\n$$\nP(M | \\tilde{f}) = \\frac{P(\\tilde{f} | M) p}{P(\\tilde{f} | M) p + P(\\tilde{f} | \\neg M)(1-p)}\n$$\nLet $D$ represent the cohort database including the individual, and $D'$ represent an adjacent database where the individual is not present (or rather, has been swapped with another individual to maintain the cohort size $n$, as is standard in bounded differential privacy). The terms $P(\\tilde{f} | M)$ and $P(\\tilde{f} | \\neg M)$ correspond to the probability densities of the mechanism's output given the database is $D$ and $D'$, respectively. Let the mechanism be $\\mathcal{A}$. Then $P(\\tilde{f} | M) = \\text{pdf}_{\\mathcal{A}(D)}(\\tilde{f})$ and $P(\\tilde{f} | \\neg M) = \\text{pdf}_{\\mathcal{A}(D')}(\\tilde{f})$.\n\nThe posterior can be rewritten by dividing the numerator and denominator by $\\text{pdf}_{\\mathcal{A}(D')}(\\tilde{f})$:\n$$\nP(M | \\tilde{f}) = \\frac{\\frac{\\text{pdf}_{\\mathcal{A}(D)}(\\tilde{f})}{\\text{pdf}_{\\mathcal{A}(D')}(\\tilde{f})} p}{\\frac{\\text{pdf}_{\\mathcal{A}(D)}(\\tilde{f})}{\\text{pdf}_{\\mathcal{A}(D')}(\\tilde{f})} p + (1-p)}\n$$\nThe mechanism $\\mathcal{A}$ is required to satisfy $\\varepsilon$-differential privacy (DP). The definition of $\\varepsilon$-DP for a randomized mechanism $\\mathcal{A}$ states that for any two adjacent databases $D$ and $D'$, and for any possible set of outputs $S$, the following inequality must hold:\n$$\nP(\\mathcal{A}(D) \\in S) \\le \\exp(\\varepsilon) \\cdot P(\\mathcal{A}(D') \\in S)\n$$\nFor continuous outputs, this guarantee extends to the probability density functions (PDFs), meaning that for any output value $\\tilde{f}$:\n$$\n\\text{pdf}_{\\mathcal{A}(D)}(\\tilde{f}) \\le \\exp(\\varepsilon) \\cdot \\text{pdf}_{\\mathcal{A}(D')}(\\tilde{f})\n$$\nThis implies that the likelihood ratio $\\frac{\\text{pdf}_{\\mathcal{A}(D)}(\\tilde{f})}{\\text{pdf}_{\\mathcal{A}(D')}(\\tilde{f})}$ is bounded above by $\\exp(\\varepsilon)$.\n\nThe adversary wishes to maximize their posterior belief. The posterior probability $P(M | \\tilde{f})$ is a monotonically increasing function of the likelihood ratio. Therefore, the maximum possible posterior probability occurs when the likelihood ratio reaches its upper bound:\n$$\n\\text{Posterior}_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\exp(\\varepsilon) p}{\\exp(\\varepsilon) p + (1-p)}\n$$\nThe Expert Determination criterion imposes the constraint that this maximum posterior probability must not exceed the threshold $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\exp(\\varepsilon) p}{\\exp(\\varepsilon) p + (1-p)} \\le \\tau\n$$\nWe now solve this inequality for $\\varepsilon$.\n$$\n\\exp(\\varepsilon) p \\le \\tau (\\exp(\\varepsilon) p + 1 - p)\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(\\varepsilon) p \\le \\tau \\exp(\\varepsilon) p + \\tau (1 - p)\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(\\varepsilon) p - \\tau \\exp(\\varepsilon) p \\le \\tau (1 - p)\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(\\varepsilon) p (1 - \\tau) \\le \\tau (1 - p)\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(\\varepsilon) \\le \\frac{\\tau (1 - p)}{p (1 - \\tau)}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives the derived relationship, which is the upper bound on $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon \\le \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau (1 - p)}{p (1 - \\tau)}\\right)\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we need to determine the minimum noise scale $b$ for the Laplace mechanism. The Laplace mechanism $\\mathcal{A}(D) = f(D) + Z$, where $Z \\sim \\mathrm{Laplace}(0,b)$, satisfies $\\varepsilon$-DP if the scale parameter $b$ is set to $b = \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\varepsilon}$, where $\\Delta f$ is the global sensitivity of the query function $f$.\n\nThe query function is the MAF, $f(D) = c/n$, where $c$ is the number of carriers in the cohort and $n$ is the fixed cohort size. The global sensitivity $\\Delta f$ is the maximum possible change in the function's output when a single individual's record is changed in the database. For a fixed cohort size $n$, changing one individual means swapping them for another. The maximum change in the number of carriers $c$ occurs when a carrier is swapped with a non-carrier (or vice-versa), which changes the count $c$ by exactly $1$.\nThus, the `$L_1$` sensitivity is:\n$$\n\\Delta f = \\max_{D, D'} |f(D) - f(D')| = \\max_{D, D'} \\left| \\frac{c_D}{n} - \\frac{c_{D'}}{n} \\right| = \\frac{1}{n} \\max |c_D - c_{D'}| = \\frac{1}{n}\n$$\nTo preserve as much utility as possible, the laboratory must add the minimum amount of noise. This is achieved by using the minimum valid value for the noise scale $b$. Since $b = \\Delta f/\\varepsilon$, minimizing $b$ requires maximizing $\\varepsilon$. From the privacy constraint derived above, the maximum permissible value for $\\varepsilon$ is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\text{max}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau (1 - p)}{p (1 - \\tau)}\\right)\n$$\nThe minimum required noise scale $b$ is therefore:\n$$\nb_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\varepsilon_{\\text{max}}} = \\frac{1/n}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau (1 - p)}{p (1 - \\tau)}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{n \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau (1 - p)}{p (1 - \\tau)}\\right)}\n$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values: $n = 10000$, $\\tau = 0.1$, and $p = 0.01$.\nFirst, we calculate $\\varepsilon_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\text{max}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.1 (1 - 0.01)}{0.01 (1 - 0.1)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.1 \\cdot 0.99}{0.01 \\cdot 0.9}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.099}{0.009}\\right) = \\ln(11)\n$$\nNow, we calculate the minimum scale $b$:\n$$\nb = \\frac{1}{10000 \\cdot \\ln(11)}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(11) \\approx 2.39789527...$:\n$$\nb \\approx \\frac{1}{10000 \\cdot 2.39789527} \\approx \\frac{1}{23978.9527} \\approx 0.0000417032\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures, we get $0.00004170$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.00004170}\n$$", "id": "4349009"}]}
