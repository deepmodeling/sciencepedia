It is not scientifically unsound, is formalizable and relevant, is complete, uses realistic parameters, is well-structured, and is not trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to calculate the posterior probability that the single observed positive test result in the biobank's aggregate data belongs to a specific target individual, given that we know this individual carries the variant $V$.\n\nLet $E$ be the event that the unique positive record corresponds to the target individual. This means the target individual enrolled and tested positive, while all other $N-1$ individuals did not contribute a positive result (either they did not enroll, or they enrolled and tested negative).\n\nLet $A$ be the event that the aggregate report shows exactly one positive call for variant $V$. This event $A$ can be decomposed into two mutually exclusive scenarios:\n1.  The event $E$ as defined above: the target is the source of the single positive call.\n2.  Let $F$ be the event that the target individual is *not* the source of the positive call, and exactly one individual from the other $N-1$ community members is the source.\n\nThe desired probability is the conditional probability of $E$ given $A$, which is $P(E|A)$. Using the definition of conditional probability, and since $E$ is a subset of $A$ (if $E$ occurs, $A$ must occur), we have:\n$$P(E|A) = \\frac{P(E \\cap A)}{P(A)} = \\frac{P(E)}{P(A)}$$\nSince $A$ is the union of the disjoint events $E$ and $F$, its probability is $P(A) = P(E) + P(F)$. Therefore, the desired probability is:\n$$P(E|A) = \\frac{P(E)}{P(E) + P(F)}$$\nThis is a form of Bayes' rule. We now compute $P(E)$ and $P(F)$.\n\nFirst, let's define two key probabilities:\n1.  The probability that the **target individual** contributes a positive result. This individual is a known carrier of variant $V$. They must be enrolled (probability $f$) and the assay must correctly detect the variant (probability $s$, the sensitivity). Let's call this probability $q_T$:\n    $$q_T = f \\cdot s$$\n\n2.  The probability that any **other individual** from the community contributes a positive result. Such an individual must enroll (probability $f$) and test positive. The probability of testing positive for a random individual is given by the law of total probability:\n    $$P(\\text{positive test}) = P(\\text{positive test} | \\text{carrier})P(\\text{carrier}) + P(\\text{positive test} | \\text{non-carrier})P(\\text{non-carrier})$$\n    Using the given parameters, this is $s \\cdot p + (1-t) \\cdot (1-p)$.\n    Let $q_O$ be the probability that a random \"other\" person contributes a positive result:\n    $$q_O = f \\cdot [s \\cdot p + (1-t) \\cdot (1-p)]$$\n\nNow, we can calculate $P(E)$ and $P(F)$.\n\n**Probability of event E:**\nEvent $E$ occurs if the target individual contributes a positive result (with probability $q_T$) AND all $N-1$ other individuals do not contribute a positive result (each with probability $1-q_O$). Due to the independence assumption, we have:\n$$P(E) = q_T \\cdot (1 - q_O)^{N-1}$$\n\n**Probability of event F:**\nEvent $F$ occurs if the target individual does *not* contribute a positive result (with probability $1-q_T$) AND exactly one of the $N-1$ other individuals contributes a positive result. The latter sub-event follows a binomial distribution with $N-1$ trials and success probability $q_O$. The probability of exactly one success is $\\binom{N-1}{1} q_O^1 (1-q_O)^{(N-1)-1}$.\n$$P(F) = (1 - q_T) \\cdot \\left[ (N-1) \\cdot q_O \\cdot (1-q_O)^{N-2} \\right]$$\n\n**Combining the probabilities:**\nWe substitute $P(E)$ and $P(F)$ into our formula for $P(E|A)$:\n$$P(E|A) = \\frac{q_T \\cdot (1 - q_O)^{N-1}}{q_T \\cdot (1 - q_O)^{N-1} + (1 - q_T) \\cdot (N-1) \\cdot q_O \\cdot (1-q_O)^{N-2}}$$\nWe can simplify this expression by dividing the numerator and denominator by $(1 - q_O)^{N-2}$:\n$$P(E|A) = \\frac{q_T \\cdot (1 - q_O)}{q_T \\cdot (1 - q_O) + (1 - q_T) \\cdot (N-1) \\cdot q_O}$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation:**\nWe substitute the given values:\n-   $N = 8000$\n-   $f = 0.03$\n-   $p = 0.004$\n-   $s = 0.98$\n-   $t = 0.995$\n\nFirst, calculate $q_T$ and $q_O$:\n$$q_T = f \\cdot s = 0.03 \\cdot 0.98 = 0.0294$$\n$$q_O = f \\cdot [s \\cdot p + (1-t) \\cdot (1-p)] = 0.03 \\cdot [0.98 \\cdot 0.004 + (1-0.995) \\cdot (1-0.004)]$$\n$$q_O = 0.03 \\cdot [0.00392 + 0.005 \\cdot 0.996] = 0.03 \\cdot [0.00392 + 0.00498]$$\n$$q_O = 0.03 \\cdot 0.0089 = 0.000267$$\n\nNow, substitute these into the simplified formula for $P(E|A)$:\n$$P(E|A) = \\frac{0.0294 \\cdot (1 - 0.000267)}{0.0294 \\cdot (1 - 0.000267) + (1 - 0.0294) \\cdot (8000-1) \\cdot 0.000267}$$\n$$P(E|A) = \\frac{0.0294 \\cdot 0.999733}{0.0294 \\cdot 0.999733 + 0.9706 \\cdot 7999 \\cdot 0.000267}$$\n$$P(E|A) = \\frac{0.0293921702}{0.0293921702 + 0.9706 \\cdot 2.135733}$$\n$$P(E|A) = \\frac{0.0293921702}{0.0293921702 + 2.0729707038}$$\n$$P(E|A) = \\frac{0.0293921702}{2.102362874} \\approx 0.0139803$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.01398$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.01398}$$", "id": "4330137"}, {"introduction": "Indigenous data sovereignty is fundamentally about control and self-determination in how data is used, which involves establishing clear governance rules that reflect a community's values.

In a recent pilot analysis, the observed carrier count was $c=28$, and a clinical decision threshold for initiating more intensive follow-up is specified at $\\tau=0.03$ for the prevalence.\n\nUse as fundamental base:\n- The definition of $\\epsilon$-Differential Privacy: for all neighboring datasets (differing in one individual) $\\mathcal{D}$ and $\\mathcal{D}'$, and all measurable outputs $S$, a randomized mechanism $\\mathcal{M}$ satisfies $\\epsilon$-DP if $\\Pr[\\mathcal{M}(\\mathcal{D}) \\in S] \\leq \\exp(\\epsilon)\\,\\Pr[\\mathcal{M}(\\mathcal{D}') \\in S]$.\n- The global sensitivity of a count query is $\\Delta=1$.\n- The Laplace mechanism adds noise $Z \\sim \\text{Laplace}(0,b)$ to the query output, where the probability density function is $f_{Z}(z) = \\frac{1}{2b}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{|z|}{b}\\right)$.\n- The basic composition property for Differential Privacy states that a sequence of $K$ mechanisms with privacy losses $\\epsilon_{1},\\ldots,\\epsilon_{K}$ has total privacy loss at most $\\sum_{i=1}^{K} \\epsilon_{i}$.\n\nStarting from these principles, derive the per-query privacy parameter $\\epsilon$ under basic composition and, from the definition of the Laplace mechanism, compute the corresponding scale parameter $b$ required for each count query.
