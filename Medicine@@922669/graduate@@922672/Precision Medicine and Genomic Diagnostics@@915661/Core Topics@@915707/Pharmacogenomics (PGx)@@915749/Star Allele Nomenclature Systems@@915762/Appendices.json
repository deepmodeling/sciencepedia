The use of star allele nomenclature, haplotypes, tag variants, and Bayesian inference for allele calling are all established principles in the field.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data ($\\pi_1, \\pi_2, s_t, c_t$, and the observation $t=1$) to compute the posterior probabilities. The question is clear and asks for a calculation and a decision based on a principled rubric.\n-   **Objective**: The language is precise and uses standard terminology from statistics and genetics. All quantities are defined, and no subjective claims are made.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a valid, formalizable problem.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Option Evaluation\n\nThe task requires the calculation of posterior probabilities $P(H_1 \\mid D)$ and $P(H_2 \\mid D)$, where $D$ is the observation $t=1$. We apply Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(H_i \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\mid H_i) P(H_i)}{\\sum_{j} P(D \\mid H_j) P(H_j)}$$\n\nFirst, we establish the likelihoods $P(D \\mid H_i)$, which means $P(t=1 \\mid H_i)$ for each haplotype.\n-   For $H_1$ (which lacks $v_3$): The probability of the tag being present ($t=1$) is a false positive. The specificity is $c_t = P(t=0 \\mid H_1) = 0.90$. Therefore, the likelihood is $P(t=1 \\mid H_1) = 1 - c_t = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n-   For $H_2$ (which has $v_3$): The probability of the tag being present ($t=1$) is a true positive. The sensitivity is $s_t = P(t=1 \\mid H_2) = 0.95$.\n\nNow, we can compute the terms in Bayes' formula using the priors $\\pi_1=0.60$ and $\\pi_2=0.40$.\nThe unnormalized posterior for $H_1$ is:\n$$P(t=1 \\mid H_1) \\pi_1 = (0.10) \\times (0.60) = 0.06$$\nThe unnormalized posterior for $H_2$ is:\n$$P(t=1 \\mid H_2) \\pi_2 = (0.95) \\times (0.40) = 0.38$$\n\nThe normalization constant (denominator) is the sum of these terms, which represents the total probability of observing $t=1$, $P(t=1)$:\n$$P(t=1) = (0.06) + (0.38) = 0.44$$\n\nNow, we compute the final posterior probabilities:\n$$P(H_1 \\mid t=1) = \\frac{0.06}{0.44} = \\frac{6}{44} = \\frac{3}{22} \\approx 0.1364$$\n$$P(H_2 \\mid t=1) = \\frac{0.38}{0.44} = \\frac{38}{44} = \\frac{19}{22} \\approx 0.8636$$\nAs a check, $0.1364 + 0.8636 = 1$. The calculations are correct.\n\nNext, we must apply the decision rule. The maximum posterior probability is $P_{\\max} = P(H_2 \\mid t=1) \\approx 0.8636$.\nThe problem states that $H_1 = \\ast 1$ is a reference haplotype (implying normal function) and $H_2 = \\ast 17$ is a gain-of-function haplotype. These imply divergent clinical recommendations for certain drugs. Therefore, the stricter resolution threshold applies: $T=0.95$.\n\nWe compare $P_{\\max}$ to $T$:\n$$0.8636 < 0.95$$\nSince the maximum posterior probability is less than the required threshold, the laboratory cannot resolve the ambiguity with sufficient confidence. The call must be reported as ambiguous (e.g., `CYP2C19 *1` or `*17`). Given the clinical significance, recommending a more definitive test, such as targeted sequencing of the $v_3$ variant, is the scientifically appropriate next step.\n\nNow, we evaluate the options based on this principled derivation.\n\n**A.** This option correctly states the application of Bayes' theorem, using $P(t=1 \\mid H_2) = s_t$ and $P(t=1 \\mid H_1) = 1 - c_t$. It proposes a decision rubric based on comparing the maximum posterior $P_{\\max}$ to a threshold $T$. It correctly identifies the need for follow-up testing (reflex testing for $v_3$ or long-read haplotyping) when the call is ambiguous and clinically significant. Finally, it correctly concludes that for this scenario, the call is ambiguous and follow-up is warranted, as our calculation showed $P_{\\max} \\approx 0.86 < 0.95$. This option perfectly aligns with the derived solution.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B.** This option suggests ignoring the experimental data from the tag and relying solely on the prior probabilities. This violates the fundamental principle of scientific inference, which is to update prior beliefs with new evidence. In this case, the evidence from the tag is substantial, increasing the belief in $H_2$ from a prior of $0.40$ to a posterior of $\\approx 0.86$. Discarding this information is incorrect.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.** This option proposes a rigid rule to always report ambiguity if a defining variant is not assayed, regardless of any other information, such as from tags. This is an overly conservative approach that fails to leverage probabilistic evidence. A tag with very high sensitivity and specificity could potentially resolve the ambiguity to a degree of certainty that exceeds the clinical threshold. Furthermore, it incorrectly advises against follow-up testing.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.** This option makes the mistake of treating a \"validated\" tag as a \"perfect\" one, setting $s_t=1$ and $c_t=1$ (which implies $P(t=1 \\mid H_1)=0$). This ignores the explicitly stated error rates ($s_t = 0.95$, $c_t = 0.90$) and leads to an overconfident, incorrect conclusion of $100\\%$ certainty. No measurement is perfect, and a principled framework must account for the known uncertainty.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nThe only option that describes a scientifically and statistically sound methodology and correctly applies it to the given scenario is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4386172"}]}
