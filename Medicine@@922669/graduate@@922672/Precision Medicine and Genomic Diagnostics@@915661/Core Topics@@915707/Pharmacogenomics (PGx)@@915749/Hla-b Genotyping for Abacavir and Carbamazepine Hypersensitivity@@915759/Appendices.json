Second, we apply these characteristics to a population of a given size and allele prevalence to calculate the expected number of SJS/TEN cases under two different scenarios: no testing versus a \"test-and-avoid\" strategy. The difference between these two outcomes will represent the number of cases avoided.\n\n**Part 1: Assay Sensitivity and Specificity**\n\nSensitivity ($\\text{Se}$) is the ability of the test to correctly identify those with the condition (in this case, the $HLA{\\text -}B^{\\ast}15{:}02$ allele). It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the total number of individuals with the allele.\nSpecificity ($\\text{Sp}$) is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the condition. It is calculated as the ratio of true negatives to the total number of individuals without the allele.\n\nGiven the validation counts: $TP = 156$, $FN = 4$, $TN = 1{,}828$, and $FP = 12$.\n\nThe total number of true carriers in the validation set is $TP + FN$.\nThe total number of true non-carriers in the validation set is $TN + FP$.\n\nSensitivity is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{Se} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} = \\frac{156}{156 + 4} = \\frac{156}{160} = 0.975 $$\n\nSpecificity is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{Sp} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP} = \\frac{1{,}828}{1{,}828 + 12} = \\frac{1{,}828}{1{,}840} $$\nThis fraction simplifies to $\\frac{457}{460}$, which is approximately $0.993478$. For accuracy, we will use the exact fraction in intermediate calculations.\n\n**Part 2: Expected SJS/TEN Cases in a Cohort of $100{,}000$ Initiators**\n\nWe analyze two scenarios for a cohort of $N = 100{,}000$ patients.\nThe prevalence of the $HLA{\\text -}B^{\\ast}15{:}02$ allele is $p = 0.08$.\nThe risk of SJS/TEN in carriers is $R_p = 0.05$.\nThe risk of SJS/TEN in non-carriers is $R_n = 0.0002$.\n\nIn the cohort of $N = 100{,}000$:\nNumber of true carriers: $N_p = N \\times p = 100{,}000 \\times 0.08 = 8{,}000$.\nNumber of true non-carriers: $N_n = N \\times (1 - p) = 100{,}000 \\times (1 - 0.08) = 100{,}000 \\times 0.92 = 92{,}000$.\n\n**Scenario A: No Testing**\nIn this scenario, all $100{,}000$ patients receive carbamazepine. The expected number of SJS/TEN cases is the sum of cases arising from the carrier and non-carrier groups.\n\nExpected cases from carriers: $E_A(\\text{carriers}) = N_p \\times R_p = 8{,}000 \\times 0.05 = 400$.\nExpected cases from non-carriers: $E_A(\\text{non-carriers}) = N_n \\times R_n = 92{,}000 \\times 0.0002 = 18.4$.\n\nTotal expected cases without testing:\n$$ E_{\\text{no test}} = E_A(\\text{carriers}) + E_A(\\text{non-carriers}) = 400 + 18.4 = 418.4 $$\n\n**Scenario B: Test-and-Avoid Strategy**\nIn this scenario, only patients who test negative receive carbamazepine. This group consists of two sub-groups: false negatives (carriers who incorrectly test negative) and true negatives (non-carriers who correctly test negative).\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of patients in each test outcome category:\n-   Number of false negatives ($FN_{\\text{pop}}$): These are carriers who test negative.\n    $$ FN_{\\text{pop}} = N_p \\times (1 - \\text{Se}) = 8{,}000 \\times (1 - 0.975) = 8{,}000 \\times 0.025 = 200 $$\n-   Number of true negatives ($TN_{\\text{pop}}$): These are non-carriers who test negative.\n    $$ TN_{\\text{pop}} = N_n \\times \\text{Sp} = 92{,}000 \\times \\frac{1{,}828}{1{,}840} = 91{,}400 $$\n-   The other groups, true positives ($TP_{\\text{pop}} = N_p \\times \\text{Se} = 8{,}000 \\times 0.975 = 7{,}800$) and false positives ($FP_{\\text{pop}} = N_n \\times (1 - \\text{Sp}) = 92{,}000 \\times (1 - \\frac{1{,}828}{1{,}840}) = 92{,}000 \\times \\frac{12}{1{,}840} = 600$), do not receive carbamazepine and thus contribute $0$ cases of carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN.\n\nNow, we calculate the expected number of SJS/TEN cases among those who receive the drug:\n-   Expected cases from false negatives (who are carriers and receive the drug):\n    $$ E_B(FN) = FN_{\\text{pop}} \\times R_p = 200 \\times 0.05 = 10 $$\n-   Expected cases from true negatives (who are non-carriers and receive the drug):\n    $$ E_B(TN) = TN_{\\text{pop}} \\times R_n = 91{,}400 \\times 0.0002 = 18.28 $$\n\nTotal expected cases with the test-and-avoid strategy:\n$$ E_{\\text{test}} = E_B(FN) + E_B(TN) = 10 + 18.28 = 28.28 $$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Cases Avoided**\n\nThe absolute number of SJS/TEN cases avoided is the difference between the expected cases in the \"no testing\" scenario and the \"test-and-avoid\" scenario.\n\n$$ \\text{Cases Avoided} = E_{\\text{no test}} - E_{\\text{test}} = 418.4 - 28.28 = 390.12 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$390.12$ rounded to four significant figures is $390.1$.

The concept of allele drop-out due to polymorphisms in primer binding sites is a well-documented and critical issue in clinical genetics and diagnostics. The specific context, HLA typing for pharmacogenomic safety (abacavir and carbamazepine hypersensitivity), is a standard-of-care clinical application.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem describes a specific technical failure (allele drop-out), provides its mechanistic basis ($3^{\\prime}$ primer mismatch), and presents quantitative parameters ($E_{\\text{match}}$, $E_{\\text{mis}}$, $q$). The question asks for an evaluation of strategies to detect and mitigate this specific, well-defined problem. It is structured to elicit a solution based on reasoning from the provided principles.\n- **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free of subjectivity. The provided data are plausible for the described scenario.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. Proceeding to solution derivation and option analysis.\n\nThe central challenge is to address allele drop-out (ADO) where a *HLA-B\\*57:01* allele fails to amplify due to a polymorphism at the primer's $3^{\\prime}$ terminus. This leads to a false-negative result, misclassifying a carrier as a non-carrier. A robust strategy must both detect when ADO occurs and, ideally, mitigate it proactively.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Lower the annealing temperature substantially to allow partially mismatched primers to bind and extend; include a no-template control and an extraction blank to check for contamination; accept homozygous calls when only a single clean sequence is observed on Sanger confirmation.**\nThis strategy is fundamentally flawed. Lowering the annealing temperature is a method to increase the tolerance for mismatches, but it does so at the cost of specificity. It promotes non-specific amplification from other *HLA-B* alleles and potentially other genomic loci, which would confound the results, likely leading to false positives or uninterpretable data. For a clinical assay, specificity is paramount. The included controls (no-template, extraction blank) are standard for monitoring contamination but are completely ineffective for detecting allele drop-out within a specific sample. Finally, accepting a homozygous call when a single sequence is observed is the precise error that this quality control system is supposed to prevent. This option codifies the failure mode rather than correcting it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Use two independent SSP or amplicon primer sets per target allele with non-overlapping $3^{\\prime}$ binding sites; include a co-amplified single-copy Internal Amplification Control (IAC) at a separate locus to monitor general PCR success; require heterozygote allele-fraction quality control on NGS with a threshold (for example, flag when the risk-allele fraction is below $0.2$); include a known heterozygous positive control in every run; perform in silico coverage analysis across the IPD-IMGT/HLA catalog to confirm that both primer sets avoid common $3^{\\prime}$-site variants on risk haplotypes.**\nThis represents a comprehensive, multi-layered quality control strategy that directly addresses the problem.\n- *Mitigation*: Using two independent primer sets provides redundancy. Given the polymorphism frequency $q = 0.08$, the probability of one set failing is $0.08$. The probability of two independent sets both failing is $q^2 = (0.08)^2 = 0.0064$, a significant reduction. Proactive *in silico* analysis to vet primers against the comprehensive IPD-IMGT/HLA database is a critical design step to minimize the risk of ADO from the outset.\n- *Detection*: A known heterozygous positive control in each run validates the entire workflow for its ability to detect both alleles. Failure to correctly genotype this control would invalidate the run. Allele-fraction analysis on the NGS data provides a powerful sample-specific check. In a heterozygote, an allele fraction significantly deviating from the expected $0.5$ (e.g., falling below a $0.2$ threshold) is a strong indicator of ADO or other amplification bias, flagging the sample for review. The IAC verifies general PCR competency, adding another layer of control. This bundle of strategies is robust and mechanistically sound.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Increase the number of PCR cycles to $50$ and raise polymerase concentration to rescue weakly amplifying templates; rely on DNA input quantification by spectrophotometry to ensure template sufficiency; accept homozygous calls if no secondary alleles are evident.**\nThis is a naive brute-force approach that would degrade assay quality. The problem states the mismatched primer leads to an efficiency of $E_{\\text{mis}} \\approx 1.0$, which implies no net amplification, only linear accumulation at best. Increasing cycles from $n=35$ to $n=50$ will not rescue a template that is not undergoing exponential amplification. For the matched allele, the amplification factor is approximately $E_{\\text{match}}^n = 1.9^{35}$. For the mismatched allele, the \"amplification\" is negligible. Increasing cycles will only exacerbate this difference and increase the risk of amplifying trace contaminants and non-specific products, destroying the signal-to-noise ratio. Raising polymerase concentration can also increase non-specific amplification. Spectrophotometry is an imprecise method for DNA quantification for PCR. Finally, accepting homozygous calls is the error to be avoided.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Replace multiplex with a single-amplicon Sanger sequencing of exon $2$ using one primer pair; call homozygosity when chromatograms show clean, single-allele peaks across polymorphic sites; use only a no-template control to rule out contamination.**\nThis strategy is a significant step backward. Firstly, `HLA` allele definitions often depend on polymorphisms across multiple exons (e.g., exons 2 and 3 for *HLA-B\\*57:01*); limiting analysis to exon 2 can lead to ambiguity and misclassification. Secondly, and more critically, Sanger sequencing is just as susceptible to ADO as the initial PCR step. If the allele with the polymorphism fails to amplify efficiently, the Sanger chromatogram will show clean, single peaks, giving a false appearance of homozygosity. This method lacks any mechanism to detect the ADO event. The proposed control (no-template) is insufficient.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Redesign primers to incorporate degenerate or universal bases at known variable positions within binding sites and add $5^{\\prime}$ universal tails to shift critical priming energy away from polymorphic $3^{\\prime}$ nucleotides; introduce a synthetic competitive spike-in template that shares the primer binding sites of the risk allele to serve as an allele-specific IAC, and pre-specify that failure of the spike-in to amplify triggers reflex testing with an alternative primer set targeting different binding sites; maintain confirmatory NGS with allelic balance thresholds.**\nThis is another highly sophisticated and effective strategy.\n- *Mitigation*: Redesigning primers with degenerate or universal bases at known polymorphic sites is a direct and elegant solution to prevent mismatches from inhibiting amplification. This mechanistically prevents the ADO from occurring in the first place for known variants.\n- *Detection*: The use of a competitive, allele-specific internal amplification control (IAC) is a state-of-the-art control. This synthetic template uses the exact same primers as the target *HLA-B\\*57:01* allele. If this spike-in fails to amplify, it proves that there is a problem with that specific amplification reaction (e.g., primer degradation, specific inhibitors), providing a direct quality check on the target amplification itself, which is far superior to a generic IAC at a different locus.\n- *Confirmation and Action*: Maintaining NGS with allelic balance checks provides a redundant layer of detection, and having a pre-specified reflex testing plan ensures proper handling of a control failure. This bundle of strategies is robust, proactive, and includes powerful, specific controls.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. Add an RNase P copy-number control qPCR on the extracted DNA to assess template integrity and quantity; if RNase P amplifies within expected cycle threshold, accept *HLA-B* genotyping results without additional locus-specific controls; call homozygous if only one allele is observed on amplicon sequencing.**\nThis strategy is insufficient. The `RNase P` gene is a common control to confirm the presence of amplifiable human genomic DNA. It serves as a check on DNA extraction success and the absence of general PCR inhibitors. However, successful amplification of `RNase P` provides no information about the performance of the locus-specific primers for *HLA-B*. The problem of ADO is caused by a polymorphism specific to the *HLA-B* locus. Therefore, a control at an unrelated locus like `RNase P` cannot detect this specific failure mode. Relying on this control alone and accepting homozygous calls is inadequate and will not prevent the false-negative errors described.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, both options B and E describe comprehensive and scientifically sound strategies that correctly identify the root cause of the problem and implement appropriate, multi-layered controls for both mitigation and detection of allele drop-out.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BE}$$", "id": "4350159"}]}
