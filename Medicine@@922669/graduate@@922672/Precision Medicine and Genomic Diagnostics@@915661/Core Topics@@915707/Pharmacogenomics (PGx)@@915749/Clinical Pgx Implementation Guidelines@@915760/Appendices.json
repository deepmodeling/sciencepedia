Start from the following foundational bases:\n\n- The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology asserts that gene copy number influences the amount of protein produced, and thus the maximum catalytic rate of an enzyme.\n- The Michaelis–Menten relation $v = \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_{m} + [S]}$ indicates that, for a fixed substrate concentration $[S]$, the reaction velocity $v$ scales with $V_{\\max}$, which is proportional to the active enzyme concentration.\n- For diploid genes with possible copy-number variation, the total $V_{\\max}$ is the sum of per-allele contributions to active enzyme, assuming additive contributions to enzyme quantity from each allele.\n- CPIC and DPWG standardization uses three allele function classes: normal function, decreased function, and no function. Adopt the well-tested quantitative assignments consistent with the standardized CYP2D6 Activity Score framework: normal function contributes a normalized per-copy activity of $1$, decreased function contributes $0.5$, and no function contributes $0$.\n\nConstruct, from these bases, an algorithm that maps a CYP2D6 genotype $g$ to a dimensionless activity score $A(g)$ by aggregating per-allele contributions with appropriate scaling by copy number.

This construction must be based on the provided foundational principles. Subsequently, this algorithm is to be applied to three specific genotypes.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the algorithm from the provided premises.\nThe problem states that for diploid genes, the total maximum reaction velocity, $V_{\\max}$, is the sum of per-allele contributions. The Michaelis-Menten relation, $v = \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_{m} + [S]}$, indicates that for a fixed substrate concentration $[S]$, the reaction velocity $v$ is directly proportional to $V_{\\max}$. The activity score is a quantitative measure of this enzymatic activity. Therefore, the total activity score for a given genotype must be the sum of the activity contributions from its constituent alleles.\n\nA genotype $g$ is composed of two haplotypes (one inherited from each parent), which we can denote as $h_1$ and $h_2$. The problem states that the total activity is an aggregation of per-allele contributions with scaling by copy number. This implies an additive model. Thus, the total activity score for genotype $g = h_1 / h_2$ is:\n$$A(g) = A(h_1) + A(h_2)$$\nwhere $A(h_1)$ and $A(h_2)$ are the activity scores of the individual haplotypes.\n\nThe activity score of a haplotype depends on the specific allele it contains and its copy number. Let $S(a)$ be the normalized per-copy activity value for an allele $a$. The problem provides the standardized quantitative assignments:\n- For a normal function allele, $S(a) = 1$.\n- For a decreased function allele, $S(a) = 0.5$.\n- For a no function allele, $S(a) = 0$.\n\nA haplotype may contain multiple copies of an allele, a phenomenon known as copy-number variation (CNV). If a haplotype $h$ consists of $n$ copies of an allele $a$ (denoted as $a\\text{x}n$), its contribution to the total activity score is the product of the copy number and the per-copy activity value:\n$$A(h) = n \\times S(a)$$\nIf a copy number is not explicitly specified for an allele on a haplotype, it is assumed to be $1$.\n\nCombining these, the general algorithm for calculating the activity score for a genotype $g$ composed of two haplotypes, $h_1 = a_1\\text{x}n_1$ and $h_2 = a_2\\text{x}n_2$, is:\n$$A(g) = (n_1 \\times S(a_1)) + (n_2 \\times S(a_2))$$\n\nNow, we apply this algorithm to the three specified genotypes using the provided allele function classifications:\n- `*1`: normal function, $S(*1) = 1$.\n- `*4`: no function, $S(*4) = 0$.\n- `*5` (gene deletion): no function, $S(*5) = 0$.\n- `*10`: decreased function, $S(*10) = 0.5$.\n- `*41`: decreased function, $S(*41) = 0.5$.\n\nCase 1: Genotype `*1/*4`\n- Haplotype 1 is `*1`. This is one copy ($n_1 = 1$) of a normal function allele. Its contribution is $1 \\times S(*1) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n- Haplotype 2 is `*4`. This is one copy ($n_2 = 1$) of a no function allele.

This represents two copies ($n_1 = 2$) of the `*4` allele, which is a no function allele. Its contribution is $2 \\times S(*4) = 2 \\times 0 = 0$.\n- Haplotype 2 is `*10`.

Encoding the assigned phenotype into the specified numerical value.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the baseline activity score ($AS_{\\text{base}}$)**\n\nThe CYP2D6 activity score is defined as the sum of the numerical values assigned to the two alleles in a patient's genotype. The problem provides the following value assignments:\n- Normal-function allele: $1$\n- Decreased-function allele: $0.5$\n- No-function allele: $0$\n\nThe patient's genotype is given as CYP2D6 $^{*}1/^{*}1$.

The inhibitor is stated to reduce the effective catalytic capacity of the enzyme by a fractional amount $I = 0.90$. This implies that the remaining fraction of active enzyme is $(1 - I)$.\n\nThe problem posits a crucial assumption: the effective activity score, $AS_{\\text{eff}}$, scales linearly with the fraction of active enzyme remaining. Based on this principle, the effective activity score can be calculated by multiplying the baseline activity score by the fraction of remaining enzyme activity.\n\nThe governing equation is:\n$$\nAS_{\\text{eff}} = AS_{\\text{base}} \\times (1 - I)\n$$\nSubstituting the known values for $AS_{\\text{base}}$ and $I$:\n$$\nAS_{\\text{base}} = 2\n$$\n$$\nI = 0.90\n$$\nThe calculation for $AS_{\\text{eff}}$ is:\n$$\nAS_{\\text{eff}} = 2 \\times (1 - 0.90) = 2 \\times 0.10 = 0.20\n$$\nThe problem requires the final value of $AS_{\\text{eff}}$ to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. Therefore:\n$$\nAS_{\\text{eff}} = 0.2000\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Assign the functional phenotype**\n\nThe functional phenotype is determined by comparing the calculated $AS_{\\text{eff}}$ to the specified activity score bins:\n- Poor metabolizer (PM): $AS_{\\text{eff}}  0.25$\n- Intermediate metabolizer (IM): $0.25 \\leq AS_{\\text{eff}}  1.25$\n- Normal metabolizer (NM): $1.25 \\leq AS_{\\text{eff}} \\leq 2.25$\n- Ultrarapid metabolizer (UM): $AS_{\\text{eff}} > 2.25$\n\nOur calculated value is $AS_{\\text{eff}} = 0.2000$.

The goal is to select an initial dose, $D_{0}$, for this patient such that their systemic exposure to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is approximately equal to the exposure of a typical patient with normal enzyme function (a normal metabolizer, NM) receiving the standard dose, $D_{\\text{std}}$.\n\nAccording to the provided principles, under steady-state linear pharmacokinetics, drug exposure is quantified by the area under the concentration-time curve, $AUC$, which is given by the relation:\n$$AUC = \\frac{D}{CL}$$\nwhere $D$ is the total dose administered over a time interval and $CL$ is the drug clearance over that same interval.\n\nLet us denote the parameters for a normal metabolizer with the subscript 'NM' and for the patient, who is an intermediate metabolizer (IM), with the subscript 'IM'.\n\nFor a normal metabolizer receiving the standard dose $D_{\\text{std}}$, the exposure is:\n$$AUC_{NM} = \\frac{D_{\\text{std}}}{CL_{NM}}$$\n\nFor the intermediate metabolizer patient receiving the initial adjusted dose $D_{0}$, the exposure is:\n$$AUC_{IM} = \\frac{D_{0}}{CL_{IM}}$$\n\nThe principle of exposure matching dictates that we set the initial dose $D_{0}$ such that the resulting exposure in the patient approximates the standard exposure:\n$$AUC_{IM} = AUC_{NM}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $AUC$ gives:\n$$\\frac{D_{0}}{CL_{IM}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{std}}}{CL_{NM}}$$\n\nThe problem states that the patient is an intermediate metabolizer with an expected fraction of normal DPYD-mediated clearance given by $f_{CL}$. Since 5-FU is predominantly eliminated by DPYD, we can approximate the total clearance of the patient as a fraction $f_{CL}$ of the normal clearance:\n$$CL_{IM} = f_{CL} \\cdot CL_{NM}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this relationship for $CL_{IM}$ into our exposure-matching equation:\n$$\\frac{D_{0}}{f_{CL} \\cdot CL_{NM}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{std}}}{CL_{NM}}$$\n\nWe can solve for the ratio of the adjusted dose to the standard dose, $\\frac{D_{0}}{D_{\\text{std}}}$.

The initial dose $D_{0}$ is based on a genotype-guided *prediction* of the patient's clearance. The parameter $f_{CL} = 0.5$ represents an average clearance reduction for individuals with a CPIC activity score of $1.0$; however, significant inter-individual variability exists. The patient's true, or phenotypic, clearance may be different from this population-level estimate.\n\nTDM involves measuring the actual 5-FU concentration in the patient's plasma after the first treatment cycle. From these measurements, a patient-specific $AUC_{\\text{actual}}$ can be calculated.

For subsequent dosing cycles, the dose (let's call it $D_{1}$) can be further adjusted to more precisely achieve the target exposure, $AUC_{NM}$. The new dose would be calculated as:\n$$D_{1} = AUC_{NM} \\cdot CL_{IM, \\text{actual}}$$\nThus, TDM serves as a feedback mechanism to refine the initial pharmacogenetically-guided dose, allowing for further personalization of therapy based on the patient's measured phenotypic response.
