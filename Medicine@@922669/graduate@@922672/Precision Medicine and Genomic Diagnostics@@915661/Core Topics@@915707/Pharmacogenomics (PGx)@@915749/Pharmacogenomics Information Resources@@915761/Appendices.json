The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, and all necessary information is provided.\n\nThe fundamental principle to be used is the Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium for a multi-allelic locus. For a locus with $n$ alleles $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$ with respective frequencies $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$ such that $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i = 1$, the expected genotype frequencies in a large, randomly mating population with no mutation, migration, or selection are given by the terms of the multinomial expansion of $(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i)^2$.

The nonfunctional allele $TPMT^{\\ast}3C$, with frequency $p_3$.\n\nThe total frequency of all alleles must be $1$, so $p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$. The problem states that $p_0 = 1 - (p_1 + p_2 + p_3)$, which is consistent with this constraint.\n\nA \"poor metabolizer\" phenotype is defined as an individual carrying $2$ nonfunctional $TPMT$ alleles. This can occur in two ways:\n- The individual is homozygous for one of the nonfunctional alleles.\n- The individual is a compound heterozygote, carrying two different nonfunctional alleles.\n\nWe can now list the genotypes corresponding to the poor metabolizer phenotype and their expected frequencies under HWE:\n- Homozygous for $TPMT^{\\ast}2$: genotype is $(TPMT^{\\ast}2 / TPMT^{\\ast}2)$, frequency is $p_1^2$.\n- Homozygous for $TPMT^{\\ast}3A$: genotype is $(TPMT^{\\ast}3A / TPMT^{\\ast}3A)$, frequency is $p_2^2$.\n- Homozygous for $TPMT^{\\ast}3C$: genotype is $(TPMT^{\\ast}3C / TPMT^{\\ast}3C)$, frequency is $p_3^2$.\n- Compound heterozygous for $TPMT^{\\ast}2$ and $TPMT^{\\ast}3A$: genotype is $(TPMT^{\\ast}2 / TPMT^{\\ast}3A)$, frequency is $2p_1p_2$.\n- Compound heterozygous for $TPMT^{\\ast}2$ and $TPMT^{\\ast}3C$: genotype is $(TPMT^{\\ast}2 / TPMT^{\\ast}3C)$, frequency is $2p_1p_3$.\n- Compound heterozygous for $TPMT^{\\ast}3A$ and $TPMT^{\\ast}3C$: genotype is $(TPMT^{\\ast}3A / TPMT^{\\ast}3C)$, frequency is $2p_2p_3$.\n\nThe total expected fraction of poor metabolizers, denoted as $F_{PM}$, is the sum of the frequencies of all these genotypes:\n$$F_{PM} = p_1^2 + p_2^2 + p_3^2 + 2p_1p_2 + 2p_1p_3 + 2p_2p_3$$\nThis expression is the complete derivation based on summing individual genotype frequencies. This expression is precisely the expansion of a trinomial squared. Let $P_{nonfunctional}$ be the total frequency of all nonfunctional alleles, such that $P_{nonfunctional} = p_1 + p_2 + p_3$. Then the expression for $F_{PM}$ can be written more compactly as:\n$$F_{PM} = (p_1 + p_2 + p_3)^2 = P_{nonfunctional}^2$$\nThis compact form can also be derived from first principles: the probability of inheriting any nonfunctional allele from a random gamete in the population pool is $P_{nonfunctional}$. Under random mating, the probability of an individual receiving a nonfunctional allele from both parents (and thus having a poor metabolizer genotype) is the product of these independent probabilities, which is $P_{nonfunctional} \\times P_{nonfunctional} = P_{nonfunctional}^2$.\n\nNext, we are asked to compute this fraction using the plausible frequencies for a specific population: $p_1 = 0.030$, $p_2 = 0.005$, and $p_3 = 0.010$.\nFirst, we calculate the total frequency of nonfunctional alleles, $P_{nonfunctional}$:\n$$P_{nonfunctional} = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 0.030 + 0.005 + 0.010 = 0.045$$\nNow, we calculate the expected fraction of poor metabolizers, $F_{PM}$:\n$$F_{PM} = (0.045)^2 = 0.002025$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The calculated value $0.002025$ has exactly four significant figures (the digits $2$, $0$, $2$, $5$), so no further rounding is necessary.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for a brief discussion on how directional selection against the poor metabolizer genotype would alter the observed fraction relative to the HWE expectation. The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium model assumes no selection, among other conditions. The calculated frequency $F_{PM} = 0.002025$ represents the expected frequency of poor metabolizers among zygotes (at conception). If there is directional selection against this genotype, characterized by a selection coefficient $s > 0$, it means that individuals with the poor metabolizer genotype have a lower probability of surviving to reproductive age (or a lower reproductive success) compared to individuals with other genotypes. Specifically, their relative fitness would be $1-s$ compared to a fitness of $1$ for other genotypes. This viability selection acts between the zygote stage and the adult stage when a population sample might be collected. Consequently, the observed frequency of poor metabolizers in the sampled adult population would be lower than the frequency predicted by the HWE model at the zygote stage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.002025}$$", "id": "4367543"}, {"introduction": "Real-world genetic analysis is often complicated by complex variants and ambiguous data, requiring careful interpretation.

The $CYP2D6$ locus is notoriously complex due to its high polymorphism, the presence of the adjacent pseudogene $CYP2D7$, and the frequent occurrence of structural variations like deletions, duplications, and hybrid alleles (gene conversions). The described findings—a hybrid allele, associated SNVs, copy number changes, and phasing ambiguity—are all well-documented and represent a realistic and challenging clinical case. The use of NGS, the reference to authoritative resources like PharmVar, PharmGKB, and CPIC, and the stated principles are all standard in the field.

The uncertainties (breakpoint, phase) are not flaws but are core components of the problem to be addressed by applying the principles, especially the principle of conservative interpretation. A logical and justifiable answer can be derived.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem statement is presented with objective, technical language, describing laboratory findings and analytical limitations. The principles are provided as axioms for solving the problem. There is no subjective or biased content.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-formulated, scientifically accurate, and objective problem in the domain of clinical molecular diagnostics and pharmacogenomics. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to determine the most appropriate way to report and functionally classify a complex $CYP2D6$ genotype characterized by a hybrid allele, a copy number of $3$, and unresolved phasing. The analysis must adhere to the five foundational principles provided.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Hybrid Allele's Identity**:\n    -   The problem states that short-read mapping ambiguity prevents assignment to a specific PharmVar star allele because the exact breakpoint is not resolved.\n    -   Principle (c) states that star alleles have *defined* breakpoints.\n    -   Therefore, it is incorrect and against standards to \"force-call\" a specific star allele (e.g., $CYP2D6*13$, $CYP2D6*36$). The allele must be described structurally and noted as not conforming to a standard definition. A description like “$CYP2D6$–$CYP2D7$ hybrid (undetermined subtype)” is accurate and transparent.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Hybrid Allele's Function**:\n    -   Finding (i) indicates that pseudogene ($CYP2D7$) sequence is present \"downstream of intron $8$ and into exon $9$.\"\n    -   Principle (a) states that coding sequence changes can abolish protein function. Principle (b) notes that pseudogene sequences often disrupt function.\n    -   In the specific context of $CYP2D6$, the sequence of $CYP2D7$ exon $9$ is known to differ from $CYP2D6$ exon $9$ in a way that introduces a frameshift mutation. This leads to a truncated, non-functional protein.\n    -   The phrase \"into exon $9$\" strongly implies that the coding sequence of exon $9$ is compromised. According to Principle (e), a conservative interpretation is required. The most conservative interpretation of a compromised exon $9$ is that the resulting protein is non-functional. Thus, the hybrid allele should be assigned \"no function.\" If there were any remote possibility that the disruption was minor and did not cause a frameshift (which is highly unlikely for a conversion \"into\" exon $9$), the next most conservative assignment would be \"uncertain function.\" Assigning \"decreased function\" would be an overestimation and violate Principle (e).\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Copy Number and Phasing**:\n    -   Finding (iii) reports a total locus copy number of $3$. This means there is one diploid pair of alleles plus one duplicated copy.\n    -   The alleles involved are the hybrid allele and \"an apparently non-hybrid $CYP2D6$ copy\" which carries SNVs associated with decreased function. Let's call these $H$ (hybrid) and $DF$ (decreased function), respectively.\n    -   Finding (iv) states the phasing is unresolved. This means we cannot distinguish between two scenarios:\n        -   Scenario 1: Duplication of the $DF$ allele. The genotype is $(H + DF)/DF$.\n        -   Scenario 2: Duplication of the $H$ allele. The genotype is $(H + DF)/H$.\n    -   The functional consequence of these two scenarios is vastly different. If $H$ is a no-function allele (value = $0$) and $DF$ is a decreased-function allele (value = $0.5$ in the standard activity score system), then:\n        -   Scenario 1 total activity score = $0 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0$ (Normal Metabolizer).\n        -   Scenario 2 total activity score = $0 + 0.5 + 0 = 0.5$ (Intermediate Metabolizer).\n    -   Principle (e) demands we avoid overestimating function. Concluding that the patient has \"increased function\" or is an \"ultrarapid metabolizer\" based on the copy number of $3$ would require assuming Scenario 1 is true, which is an unsupported overestimation. The correct approach is to state that the phase is unresolved and that a definitive phenotype prediction cannot be made. The report must not infer increased function.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

Decompose the event into separate “CYP2D6” and “CYP2D7” alleles, average the functional impact of the two genes to obtain an “intermediate” effect, and because the total copy number is $3$, classify the event as “ultrarapid metabolizer” due to higher gene dosage.**\n\n-   **Nomenclature**: Decomposing a single hybrid allele is biologically nonsensical. It is one genetic entity.\n-   **Functional Mapping**: \"Averaging\" the function of a gene and a pseudogene is not a valid biological or pharmacogenomic principle.\n-   **Overall Phenotype**: Classifying as \"ultrarapid metabolizer\" ignores the phasing uncertainty and massively overestimates function, violating Principle (e).\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.

PharmVar distinguishes these structural variant types. While the functional impact may be similar (\"no function\"), the genetic structure is different. Best practice is to describe what is observed.\n-   **Functional Mapping/Phenotype**: The reasoning contains a severe contradiction. It correctly maps the hybrid to \"no function\" but then assumes the \"extra copy\" (the duplicated one) is functional.
