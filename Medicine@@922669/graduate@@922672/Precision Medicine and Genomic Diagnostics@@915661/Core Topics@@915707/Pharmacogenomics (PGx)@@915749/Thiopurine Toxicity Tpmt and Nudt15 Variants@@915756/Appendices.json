It is scientifically grounded in the principles of population genetics, specifically the Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), and its application to pharmacogenomics. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of genotype frequencies from the first principles of HWE, which models the distribution of genotypes in a population that satisfies several key assumptions: a large population size, random mating, and the absence of evolutionary influences such as mutation, gene flow, and natural selection. The problem states that these conditions hold.\n\nWe are considering a single autosomal locus with two alleles, a major allele $\\text{C}$ with frequency $p$ and a minor allele $\\text{T}$ with frequency $q$. The total frequency of alleles at this locus must sum to $1$, so we have the relation $p + q = 1$.\n\nUnder HWE, the formation of a diploid genotype for an individual is equivalent to drawing two alleles independently from the population's gene pool. In this pool, the probability of selecting an allele $\\text{C}$ is $p$, and the probability of selecting an allele $\\text{T}$ is $q$.\n\nWe can derive the expected frequencies of the three possible genotypes ($\\text{CC}$, $\\text{CT}$, and $\\text{TT}$) as follows:\n\n1.  **Homozygous $\\text{CC}$ Genotype**: An individual with this genotype inherits a $\\text{C}$ allele from both parents. Since the allele draws are independent events, the probability of this combination is the product of their individual probabilities.\n    $$\n    f(\\text{CC}) = p \\times p = p^{2}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Homozygous $\\text{TT}$ Genotype**: Similarly, an individual with the $\\text{TT}$ genotype inherits a $\\text{T}$ allele from both parents. The probability is:\n    $$\n    f(\\text{TT}) = q \\times q = q^{2}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Heterozygous $\\text{CT}$ Genotype**: An individual can be heterozygous in two ways: by inheriting a $\\text{C}$ from the first parent and a $\\text{T}$ from the second, or by inheriting a $\\text{T}$ from the first and a $\\text{C}$ from the second. The probability of the first case is $p \\times q$, and the probability of the second case is $q \\times p$. Since these are mutually exclusive events, we sum their probabilities:\n    $$\n    f(\\text{CT}) = (p \\times q) + (q \\times p) = 2pq\n    $$\n\nThese three frequencies, $p^{2}$, $2pq$, and $q^{2}$, represent the terms of the binomial expansion of $(p+q)^{2}$. As required by the completeness of probabilities, their sum is $p^{2} + 2pq + q^{2} = (p+q)^{2} = 1^{2} = 1$.\n\nThe problem defines two categories based on genotype:\n-   \"Poor metabolizers\" correspond to the homozygous $\\text{TT}$ genotype.\n-   \"Heterozygotes\" correspond to the $\\text{CT}$ genotype.\n\nThe task is to express the proportions of these two categories purely in terms of $q$, the minor allele frequency of $\\text{T}$.\n\nThe proportion of poor metabolizers is the frequency of the $\\text{TT}$ genotype, which is:\n$$\n\\text{Proportion of poor metabolizers} = f(\\text{TT}) = q^{2}\n$$\nThis expression is already in terms of $q$.\n\nThe proportion of heterozygotes is the frequency of the $\\text{CT}$ genotype:\n$$\n\\text{Proportion of heterozygotes} = f(\\text{CT}) = 2pq\n$$\nTo express this solely in terms of $q$, we use the given relationship $p + q = 1$, which implies $p = 1 - q$. Substituting this into the expression for the heterozygote frequency gives:\n$$\n\\text{Proportion of heterozygotes} = 2(1-q)q = 2q - 2q^{2}\n$$\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix containing the proportion of poor metabolizers followed by the proportion of heterozygotes. These are $q^{2}$ and $2q - 2q^{2}$, respectively.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} q^{2}  2q - 2q^{2} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4392265"}, {"introduction": "Translating a patient's genotype into a quantitative, clinically relevant phenotype is a core task in precision medicine.

This practice bridges the gap between a genetic test report and a functional prediction, demonstrating how TPMT activity can be estimated and categorized to inform initial thiopurine dosing strategies.", "problem": "A clinical laboratory quantifies Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) catalytic activity in Red Blood Cells (RBCs) as enzyme units per milliliter of packed RBCs (U/mL). In population studies, the mean RBC TPMT activity for homozygous wild-type individuals is reported as $\\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/WT}} = 34.6$ U/mL packed RBCs, and the mean for homozygous functionally null individuals (complete TPMT deficiency) is reported as $\\mu_{\\mathrm{null/null}} = 0.8$ U/mL packed RBCs.

The calculation is to be based on the principle of additive gene dosage.\n\nLet $\\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/WT}}$ represent the mean enzyme activity in individuals homozygous for the wild-type allele, and let $\\mu_{\\mathrm{null/null}}$ represent the mean activity in individuals homozygous for a functionally null allele.

Let $A_{\\mathrm{WT}}$ be the activity contribution from a single wild-type allele and $A_{\\mathrm{null}}$ be the activity contribution from a single null allele.\n\nFor a homozygous wild-type individual ($\\mathrm{WT/WT}$), the total activity is the sum of contributions from two wild-type alleles:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/WT}} = A_{\\mathrm{WT}} + A_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 2 A_{\\mathrm{WT}} $$\nFrom this, we can derive the activity contribution of a single wild-type allele:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/WT}}}{2} $$\n\nFor a homozygous null individual ($\\mathrm{null/null}$), the total activity is the sum of contributions from two null alleles. The non-zero value for $\\mu_{\\mathrm{null/null}}$ reflects baseline assay noise or minimal residual activity, which is modeled as the contribution of the \"null\" allele.\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{null/null}} = A_{\\mathrm{null}} + A_{\\mathrm{null}} = 2 A_{\\mathrm{null}} $$\nThe activity contribution of a single null allele is:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{null}} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{null/null}}}{2} $$\n\nThe individual in question has a TPMT*3A/wild-type genotype. The problem states that for modeling purposes, the TPMT*3A allele is to be treated as functionally equivalent to a null allele. Therefore, we are calculating the expected activity for a $\\mathrm{WT/null}$ heterozygote, which we denote as $\\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/null}}$.\n\nBased on the additive model, the expected activity for the heterozygote is the sum of the contribution from one wild-type allele and one null allele:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/null}} = A_{\\mathrm{WT}} + A_{\\mathrm{null}} $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $A_{\\mathrm{WT}}$ and $A_{\\mathrm{null}}$ derived from the homozygote means:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/null}} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/WT}}}{2} + \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{null/null}}}{2} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/WT}} + \\mu_{\\mathrm{null/null}}}{2} $$\nThis result shows that under the additive gene dosage model, the expected activity of a heterozygote is the arithmetic mean of the two corresponding homozygote activities.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this derived formula:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/null}} = \\frac{34.6 + 0.8}{2} $$\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/null}} = \\frac{35.4}{2} $$\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/null}} = 17.7 \\, \\text{U/mL} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

This final practice [@problem_id:4392253] places you in the role of a clinical expert faced with an apparent contradiction: a patient's genotype predicts drug intolerance, yet standard metabolite monitoring does not seem to confirm it. To solve this puzzle, you must synthesize your knowledge of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and cell-specific biology, honing the critical reasoning skills necessary to navigate the nuances of personalized medicine.", "problem": "A clinician is evaluating a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia on daily 6-mercaptopurine at $50\\,\\mathrm{mg/m^2}$. Germline testing shows heterozygosity for the Nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) c.$415$C$$T (p.R139C) variant and normal thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) genotype. By day $10$, the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) has fallen to grade $3$ neutropenia, prompting a metabolite assessment on day $12$: red blood cell (RBC) thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs) are $120$ pmol per $8 \\times 10^8$ RBC and RBC 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP) is $600$ pmol per $8 \\times 10^8$ RBC. No pharmacokinetic sampling of parent drug has been done. The patient’s transfusion history in the past $4$ weeks is unclear.\n\nIn precision medicine and genomic diagnostics, reconcile this apparent discrepancy—NUDT15 genotype predicting intolerance but measured RBC TGNs being low—by reasoning from fundamental principles: the Central Dogma (DNA$\\to$RNA$\\to$protein), enzyme function in drug metabolism, and compartmental pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, including differences in cell turnover between erythroid and myeloid lineages. Based on that reasoning, choose the option(s) that both provide a mechanistically coherent hypothesis for the low RBC TGNs and specify tests that can adjudicate among competing explanations with high discriminative value.\n\nSelect all that apply.\n\nA. Low RBC TGNs reflect delayed accumulation in the erythrocyte compartment because RBCs turn over slowly relative to leukocyte precursors; early sampling underestimates steady-state RBC TGNs while NUDT15 deficiency elevates DNA-incorporated thioguanine in proliferating myeloid cells. Adjudication: repeat RBC TGN and 6-MMP after $\\ge 4$ weeks of stable dosing; concurrently quantify DNA-incorporated thioguanine (DNA-TG) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or granulocytes by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).\n\nB. Low RBC TGNs arise from high TPMT activity driving preferential methylation to 6-MMP, explaining neutropenia via 6-MMP–mediated myelotoxicity. Adjudication: measure erythrocyte TPMT enzyme activity and recheck RBC 6-MMP to confirm disproportionate 6-MMP formation.\n\nC. Low RBC TGNs are due to recent RBC transfusion and/or accelerated erythropoiesis after myelosuppression, diluting the patient’s endogenous RBC pool and resetting metabolite content, while NUDT15-associated intolerance is driven by DNA-TG in myeloid precursors. Adjudication: verify transfusion records; measure reticulocyte percentage and immature reticulocyte fraction; remeasure RBC TGNs $2$–$3$ weeks post-transfusion window; add leukocyte DNA-TG quantification.\n\nD. Low RBC TGNs primarily indicate non-adherence; neutropenia is unrelated to thiopurine exposure. Adjudication: obtain a single serum 6-mercaptopurine concentration $2$ hours post-dose to confirm adherence.\n\nE. Low RBC TGNs reflect compartment-specific effects of NUDT15 deficiency that increase thioguanosine triphosphate in cycling myeloid precursors, promoting DNA incorporation and cytotoxicity without necessarily elevating cytosolic RBC TGN pools in enucleated erythrocytes. Adjudication: perform targeted LC-MS/MS for DNA-TG in sorted granulocytes or bone marrow myeloid precursors; complement with functional NUDT15 activity assay in PBMC lysates to correlate genotype with enzymatic phenotype.", "solution": "The problem presents a classic clinical paradox in thiopurine pharmacogenomics: severe myelotoxicity in a patient with a known risk genotype (*NUDT15* heterozygosity), but with low levels of the standard biomarker, red blood cell (RBC) thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs). A valid hypothesis must reconcile all these findings mechanistically.\n\n**Analysis of the Scenario:**\n*   **Patient:** Diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, receiving 6-mercaptopurine.\n*   **Genotype:** Heterozygous for the *NUDT15* p.R139C variant (an intermediate metabolizer), and wild-type for *TPMT*. This genotype confers a known, significant risk for myelosuppression.\n*   **Clinical Outcome:** Severe (grade 3) neutropenia develops rapidly (by day 10), consistent with the genetic risk.\n*   **Biomarker Paradox:** On day 12, RBC TGN levels are low (120 pmol per 8x10⁸ RBCs), well below the typical therapeutic range (e.g., 235–450 pmol per 8x10⁸ RBCs). This appears to contradict the observed toxicity.\n\nThe core of the problem is to explain why RBC TGNs are low despite clear evidence of drug toxicity mediated by a known genetic variant.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A. Correct.** This hypothesis correctly identifies two key concepts. First, the pharmacokinetics in the surrogate compartment (RBCs) can lag behind the pharmacodynamics in the target compartment (bone marrow). Mature RBCs have a long lifespan (~120 days) and slowly accumulate TGNs. In contrast, toxicity occurs in rapidly dividing hematopoietic precursors. Second, it correctly identifies that the ultimate toxic mechanism for NUDT15 is the accumulation and incorporation of thioguanine into DNA (DNA-TG), which is a more direct measure of toxicity in the target cells. The proposed adjudication—repeating TGNs later to assess steady-state and directly measuring DNA-TG in leukocytes—is the correct way to test this hypothesis.\n\n*   **B. Incorrect.** This hypothesis posits high TPMT activity shunting the drug to 6-MMP, causing toxicity. This is inconsistent with the patient's normal *TPMT* genotype. Furthermore, the primary toxicity of 6-MMP is hepatotoxicity, not the severe myelosuppression observed. The measured 6-MMP level is also not exceptionally high.\n\n*   **C. Correct.** This hypothesis presents a critical confounding factor for any TDM based on RBC metabolites. A recent blood transfusion would introduce donor RBCs (with zero metabolites) into the patient's circulation, artificially diluting the measured TGN concentration. Similarly, accelerated erythropoiesis (the body's response to myelosuppression) would release a wave of new, metabolite-free RBCs. Both events would make the measured RBC TGN level an inaccurate reflection of the true drug exposure in target tissues. The proposed adjudication—verifying transfusion history, assessing RBC turnover with a reticulocyte count, and measuring DNA-TG—is a perfect clinical investigation strategy.\n\n*   **D. Incorrect.** The hypothesis of non-adherence is directly contradicted by the primary clinical finding: severe, grade 3 neutropenia. This level of myelosuppression is strong evidence that the patient has been taking the drug and is experiencing its cytotoxic effects.\n\n*   **E. Correct.** This hypothesis provides the most fundamental mechanistic explanation. NUDT15's role is to de-phosphorylate thiopurine *triphosphates* (like dTGTP), which are the immediate precursors for DNA incorporation. In enucleated, non-replicating mature RBCs, the full impact of NUDT15 deficiency may not be reflected in the total TGN pool. However, in rapidly cycling myeloid precursors, the failure to clear dTGTP leads to its massive accumulation and incorporation into DNA, triggering apoptosis and neutropenia. Therefore, toxicity is driven by events in the precursor compartment that are not captured by measuring total TGNs in the RBC compartment. The adjudication—measuring DNA-TG in sorted target cells and performing a functional NUDT15 assay—directly probes this mechanism.\n\nThus, options A, C, and E all present mechanistically sound and non-mutually exclusive explanations for the observed clinical and laboratory findings.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "4392253"}]}
