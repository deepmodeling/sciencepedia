Consider the Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter Family Member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) designated `c.521T>C`, which reduces the function of the hepatic transporter Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B1. Under the Central Dogma of molecular biology, changes in DNA sequence can alter messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein function, thereby modulating pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In a hospital-based case-control study of simvastatin-treated patients, genotyping for `c.521T>C` yielded the following counts:\n\n- Myopathy cases: $\\mathrm{TT} = 38$, $\\mathrm{TC} = 42$, $\\mathrm{CC} = 10$.\n- Non-myopathy controls: $\\mathrm{TT} = 210$, $\\mathrm{TC} = 70$, $\\mathrm{CC} = 5$.\n\nAssume a dominant genetic model for `c.521T>C` on transporter function, in which carriers of the minor allele ($\\mathrm{TC}$ or $\\mathrm{CC}$) are grouped together as exposed, and non-carriers ($\\mathrm{TT}$) are unexposed.

The `SLCO1B1` gene, the c.$521$T$>$C polymorphism, its effect on statin pharmacokinetics, and the association with myopathy are all well-documented in scientific literature. The use of a case-control study to calculate an odds ratio is a standard and fundamental epidemiological method.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (genotype counts for cases and controls) and a clear definition of exposure (dominant genetic model) required to calculate a unique odds ratio. The question is specific and unambiguous.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated objectively, presenting factual data and asking for a specific quantitative calculation. The contextual information about clinical guidelines is explicitly separated from the calculation task, which prevents subjective interpretation from influencing the required analysis.\n- **Other Flaws**: The problem is free of contradictions, incompleteness, unrealistic data, or any other listed flaws. The genotype counts are reasonable for such a study.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed by applying the standard formula for an odds ratio to the provided case-control data.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe odds ratio ($OR$) in a case-control study is a measure of association between an exposure and an outcome. It is defined as the ratio of the odds of exposure among the cases to the odds of exposure among the controls.\n\nLet the standard $2 \\times 2$ contingency table be structured as follows:\n- $A$: Number of cases who are exposed.\n- $B$: Number of controls who are exposed.\n- $C$: Number of cases who are unexposed.\n- $D$: Number of controls who are unexposed.\n\nThe odds of exposure among cases is given by the ratio $\\frac{A}{C}$.\nThe odds of exposure among controls is given by the ratio $\\frac{B}{D}$.\n\nThe odds ratio is therefore:\n$$\nOR = \\frac{\\text{Odds of exposure in cases}}{\\text{Odds of exposure in controls}} = \\frac{A/C}{B/D} = \\frac{A \\cdot D}{B \\cdot C}\n$$\n\nAccording to the problem statement, a dominant genetic model is assumed. This means:\n- \"Exposed\" individuals are carriers of at least one minor allele 'C', corresponding to genotypes $\\mathrm{TC}$ or $\\mathrm{CC}$.\n- \"Unexposed\" individuals are non-carriers, corresponding to genotype $\\mathrm{TT}$.\n\nWe can now categorize the given counts into the variables $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n\nFor the cases (myopathy group):\n- The number of exposed cases, $A$, is the sum of individuals with $\\mathrm{TC}$ and $\\mathrm{CC}$ genotypes:\n$$\nA = 42 + 10 = 52\n$$\n- The number of unexposed cases, $C$, is the number of individuals with the $\\mathrm{TT}$ genotype:\n$$\nC = 38\n$$\n\nFor the controls (non-myopathy group):\n- The number of exposed controls, $B$, is the sum of individuals with $\\mathrm{TC}$ and $\\mathrm{CC}$ genotypes:\n$$\nB = 70 + 5 = 75\n$$\n- The number of unexposed controls, $D$, is the number of individuals with the $\\mathrm{TT}$ genotype:\n$$\nD = 210\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the odds ratio formula:\n$$\nOR = \\frac{A \\cdot D}{B \\cdot C} = \\frac{52 \\cdot 210}{75 \\cdot 38}\n$$\nPerforming the multiplication for the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\nOR = \\frac{10920}{2850}\n$$\nNow, we perform the division to find the numerical value of the odds ratio:\n$$\nOR \\approx 3.8315789...\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $3$, $8$, $3$, and $1$. The fifth significant figure is $5$, which requires rounding up the fourth digit. Therefore, the value $3.831$ is rounded up to $3.832$.\n\nThe estimated odds ratio for statin-associated myopathy, comparing carriers of the c.$521$C allele to non-carriers, is $3.832$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.832}$$", "id": "4569576"}, {"introduction": "While well-studied common variants provide the basis for many pharmacogenomic guidelines, the modern era of sequencing frequently uncovers rare and novel variants whose clinical significance is unknown.

This is a missense variant.\n-   **Patient Phenotype**: Severe statin-associated myopathy.\n-   **Population Data (gnomAD)**: Global minor allele frequency (MAF) $= 2 \\times 10^{-5}$. Observed counts: $0$ homozygotes, $6$ heterozygotes. Total sampled alleles $\\approx 300,000$.\n-   **In Silico Predictions**: SIFT $=$ deleterious; PolyPhen-2 $=$ probably damaging; REVEL $=$ $0.86$; CADD $=$ $27$.\n-   **Functional Data (HEK293 cells)**:\n    -   Compared to wild-type, the variant shows a statistically significant ($p < 0.001$) reduction in maximal transport velocity ($V_{\\max}$) for two statin substrates, with no change in the Michaelis constant ($K_m$).\n    -   Rosuvastatin: Wild-type $V_{\\max} = 100$ $\\mathrm{pmol}\\cdot\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$, variant $V_{\\max} = 22$ $\\mathrm{pmol}\\cdot\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$ (a $78\\%$ reduction).\n    -   Pitavastatin: Wild-type $V_{\\max} = 100$ $\\mathrm{pmol}\\cdot\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$, variant $V_{\\max} = 30$ $\\mathrm{pmol}\\cdot\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$ (a $70\\%$ reduction).\n-   **Case-Control Data**: The variant was observed in $4$ out of $500$ cases ($0.8\\%$) and $0$ out of $3000$ controls ($0\\%$).

The experimental methods (heterologous expression systems, Michaelis-Menten kinetics), databases (gnomAD), and analytical frameworks (ACMG-AMP, Bayesian statistics) are standard in the field. All data are biologically and statistically plausible.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides a clear question and a complete set of data and rules (the adapted ACMG-AMP framework) required to derive a unique, quantitative answer.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem presents observational data and established context without subjective or biased language.\n\nNo flaws listed in the validation checklist are present. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of Solution\n\nThe task is to evaluate the evidence for the `p.Asp369Tyr` variant according to the ACMG-AMP criteria and then combine these criteria using the provided Bayesian framework to determine the variant's classification.\n\n1.  **Evaluation of Pathogenic Criteria**:\n\n    -   **PVS1 (Pathogenic, Very Strong)**: This criterion is for null variants (e.g., nonsense, frameshift) in a gene where loss-of-function is the known mechanism. The variant `p.Asp369Tyr` is a missense variant, not a null variant. The problem explicitly states not to assume a truncating or canonical splice effect. Therefore, **PVS1 is not applicable**.\n\n    -   **PS3 (Pathogenic, Strong)**: This criterion evaluates functional studies. The provided data show a severe reduction in transporter function ($V_{\\max}$ reduced by $70-78\\%$) for two different, clinically relevant substrates. The assays are performed in a well-established system, the results are statistically significant ($p < 0.001$), and the observed loss-of-function is consistent with the known disease mechanism. This is a clear-cut case for applying PS3. The magnitude of the effect justifies a strength of **Strong**. (LR = $18.7$)\n\n    -   **PS4 (Pathogenic, Strong)**: This criterion assesses case-control data. The variant is substantially enriched in cases ($4/500$) versus controls ($0/3000$), with a statistically significant Fisher's exact test ($p = 0.004$). However, the ACMG-AMP guidelines and subsequent expert specifications from groups like ClinGen advise caution when case numbers are small. For case counts below $7$, a strength of 'Strong' is generally not recommended, even with a significant p-value, due to the instability of the estimate. A strength of **Moderate** is a more rigorous and defensible assignment for this evidence. (LR = $4.33$)\n\n    -   **PM2 (Pathogenic, Moderate)**: This criterion addresses allele frequency. The variant's MAF in gnomAD is $2 \\times 10^{-5}$, which is extremely rare and well below any reasonable threshold for a benign allele for this condition. In modern practice, for a missense variant, PM2 is typically applied at a **Supporting** strength, especially when other evidence is present. (LR = $2.08$)\n\n    -   **PP3 (Pathogenic, Supporting)**: This criterion is for computational (in silico) predictions. There is a consensus among multiple reputable prediction algorithms (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, REVEL, CADD), all of which predict a damaging effect with high confidence scores (REVEL=$0.86$, CADD=$27$). This meets the criterion for PP3 at a **Supporting** strength. (LR = $2.08$)\n\n2.  **Evaluation of Benign Criteria**:\n\n    -   **BS1 (Benign, Stand-alone)**: This applies if an allele is too common in the general population. An MAF of $2 \\times 10^{-5}$ is far too rare to meet this criterion. **BS1 is not applicable**.\n    -   **BS3 (Benign, Stand-alone)**: This applies if functional studies show no adverse effect. The provided studies show a clear and significant adverse effect on function. **BS3 is not applicable**.\n\n3.  **Bayesian Calculation and Classification**:\n\n    We combine the likelihood ratios from the applicable pathogenic criteria: PS3_Strong, PS4_Moderate, PM2_Supporting, and PP3_Supporting.\n\n    The prior odds of pathogenicity are $O_0 = 1/9$.\n    The posterior odds ($O_{post}$) are calculated by multiplying the prior odds by the LRs of all independent pieces of evidence:\n    $$ O_{post} = O_0 \\times LR_{PS3\\_S} \\times LR_{PS4\\_M} \\times LR_{PM2\\_S} \\times LR_{PP3\\_S} $$\n    $$ O_{post} = \\frac{1}{9} \\times 18.7 \\times 4.33 \\times 2.08 \\times 2.08 $$\n    $$ O_{post} \\approx 0.1111 \\times 18.7 \\times 4.33 \\times 4.3264 $$\n    $$ O_{post} \\approx 0.1111 \\times 350.36 \\approx 38.92 $$\n\n    The posterior probability of pathogenicity ($P_{post}$) is derived from the posterior odds:\n    $$ P_{post} = \\frac{O_{post}}{1 + O_{post}} = \\frac{38.92}{1 + 38.92} = \\frac{38.92}{39.92} \\approx 0.975 $$\n\n    The standard ACMG-AMP classification thresholds based on posterior probability are:\n    -   Pathogenic: $P_{post} \\geq 0.99$\n    -   **Likely Pathogenic**: $\\mathbf{0.90 \\leq P_{post} < 0.99}$\n    -   Uncertain Significance: $0.10 \\leq P_{post} < 0.90$\n\n    Our calculated posterior probability of $\\approx 0.975$ falls firmly within the **Likely Pathogenic** range.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A. Classify as pathogenic, citing a “very strong” null-variant criterion (PVS1)...**\n    The use of PVS1 is incorrect as the variant is a missense change, not a null variant. This is a fundamental error in applying the ACMG-AMP framework.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **B. Classify as likely pathogenic, based on strong functional evidence (PS3 strong), moderate case–control enrichment (PS4 moderate), rare population frequency (PM2 supporting), and consistent in silico predictions (PP3 supporting), yielding a posterior probability between $0.90$ and $0.99$.**\n    This option correctly identifies all relevant criteria (PS3, PS4, PM2, PP3) and assigns them strengths consistent with rigorous, modern interpretations of the ACMG-AMP guidelines (Strong for robust functional data, Moderate for case-control data with small numbers, Supporting for rarity and in silico data). This combination of evidence leads to a posterior probability of $\\approx 0.975$, which is between $0.90$ and $0.99$, justifying a \"Likely Pathogenic\" classification. This analysis is fully consistent with our derivation.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **C. Classify as likely benign, invoking the benign stand-alone population criterion (BS1)... and benign functional evidence (BS3)...**\n    This option makes two critical errors. The allele frequency of $2 \\times 10^{-5}$ is extremely rare and does not meet criterion BS1. The functional data show a severe loss-of-function, which is evidence for pathogenicity (PS3), not benign impact (BS3). The argument that an unchanged $K_m$ is benign is a misunderstanding of enzyme kinetics.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. Classify as uncertain significance, citing conflicting evidence...**\n    The evidence is not conflicting; it is concordant. All available data (population, in silico, functional, and case-control) point toward a damaging, pathogenic effect. The argument that the kinetic profile is ambiguous is incorrect; it represents a clear loss-of-function. The argument to dismiss the case-control data entirely due to power is also too extreme; the correct approach is to downgrade its strength (to Moderate, as in option B), not to ignore it. A VUS classification is not justified when multiple lines of strong, concordant evidence are present.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **E. Classify as pathogenic, combining strong functional evidence (PS3 strong) and strong case–control evidence (PS4 strong)...**\n    This option overstates the strength of the case-control evidence. Assigning PS4 as 'Strong' based on only $4$ variant-positive cases is not consistent with current best practices for ACMG-AMP rule specification, which recommend a 'Moderate' strength for such small numbers. This aggressive interpretation leads to a 'Pathogenic' classification, which is less rigorously supported than the 'Likely Pathogenic' classification. Option B provides a more meticulous and defensible application of the standards.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5042841"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of pharmacogenomics is to move beyond qualitative risk labels toward quantitative predictions that can inform personalized dosing.

Using microsomal protein per gram of liver (MPPGL, mg/g), liver mass $M_{\\mathrm{liver}}$ in g, and a relative expression factor (REF) scaling genotype-dependent OATP1B1 abundance, the in vivo sinusoidal uptake intrinsic clearance is\n$$\nCL_{\\mathrm{int,uptake}}^{\\mathrm{in\\;vivo}} \\;=\\; CL_{\\mathrm{int,uptake}}^{\\mathrm{in\\;vitro}} \\times \\mathrm{MPPGL} \\times M_{\\mathrm{liver}} \\times \\mathrm{REF}.\n$$\nWith $CL_{\\mathrm{int,uptake}}^{\\mathrm{in\\;vitro}} = 40 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{min}/\\mathrm{mg} = 40\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{min}/\\mathrm{mg}$, $\\mathrm{MPPGL} = 45\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{g}$, and $M_{\\mathrm{liver}} = 1500\\,\\mathrm{g}$, the genotype-independent scaling factor is $2.7\\,\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{min}$, so $CL_{\\mathrm{int,uptake}}^{\\mathrm{in\\;vivo}} = 2.7\\times \\mathrm{REF}$ in L/min.\n\nStep 2: Composite intrinsic hepatic clearance for serial uptake and metabolism. For two irreversible, first-order processes in series with intrinsic clearances $PS_{\\mathrm{inf}}$ (sinusoidal uptake) and $CL_{\\mathrm{int,met}}$ (metabolism), steady-state flux equivalence and mass balance yield the harmonic-mean form for the net intrinsic hepatic clearance:\n$$\nCL_{\\mathrm{int,h}} \\;=\\; \\left( \\frac{1}{PS_{\\mathrm{inf}}} + \\frac{1}{CL_{\\mathrm{int,met}}} \\right)^{-1} \\;=\\; \\frac{PS_{\\mathrm{inf}} \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{int,met}}}{PS_{\\mathrm{inf}} + CL_{\\mathrm{int,met}}}.\n$$\nHere $PS_{\\mathrm{inf}} \\equiv CL_{\\mathrm{int,uptake}}^{\\mathrm{in\\;vivo}}$ and $CL_{\\mathrm{int,met}}$ is given as $3.5\\,\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{min}$.\n\nStep 3: Unbound, well-stirred liver model. The hepatic clearance $CL_h$ relates organ blood flow $Q_h$ (L/min), unbound fraction in blood $f_{u,b}$, and intrinsic hepatic clearance $CL_{\\mathrm{int,h}}$ as\n$$\nCL_h \\;=\\; \\frac{Q_h \\cdot f_{u,b} \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{int,h}}}{Q_h + f_{u,b} \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{int,h}}}.\n$$\nThe hepatic extraction ratio is $E_h = CL_h/Q_h$, and hepatic availability is $F_h = 1 - E_h$.\n\nStep 4: Systemic clearance and oral exposure. Systemic clearance combines hepatic and renal contributions under linear disposition:\n$$\nCL_{\\mathrm{sys}} \\;=\\; CL_h + CL_{\\mathrm{renal}}.\n$$\nLet gut availability be $F_g$. Then oral bioavailability is $F = F_g \\cdot F_h$. For an oral dose $D$ (mg) and linear kinetics, the oral AUC is\n$$\n\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{oral}} \\;=\\; \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL_{\\mathrm{sys}}}\n$$\nwith units mg·min/L when $CL_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ is in L/min. The AUC fold-change for a test case is the ratio of its $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{oral}}$ to that of the reference case (Case $1$).\n\nStep 5: QSP myopathy effect and high-risk flag. The average total steady-state plasma concentration over dosing interval $\\tau$ is\n$$\n\\overline{C}_{\\mathrm{avg}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{oral}}}{\\tau} \\quad (\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{L}).\n$$\nThe average unbound plasma concentration is $C_{u} = f_{u,p}\\,\\overline{C}_{\\mathrm{avg}}$. A simple partition to muscle gives $C_{\\mathrm{muscle}} = K_p \\cdot C_u$. A Hill function (Hill coefficient $n=1$) defines the continuous effect score\n$$\n\\mathrm{Effect} \\;=\\; \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{muscle}}}{EC_{50} + C_{\\mathrm{muscle}}}.\n$$\nThe high-risk flag is true if $\\mathrm{Effect} \\ge \\theta$.\n\nStep 6: Algorithmic implementation.\n- Precompute the IVIVE scaling constant $S = 40\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{min}/\\mathrm{mg} \\times 45\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{g} \\times 1500\\,\\mathrm{g} = 2.7\\,\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{min}$.\n- For each test case with $\\mathrm{REF}$, compute $PS_{\\mathrm{inf}} = S \\cdot \\mathrm{REF}$, then $CL_{\\mathrm{int,h}}$ via the harmonic mean with $CL_{\\mathrm{int,met}}$, then $CL_h$ via the well-stirred model, $F_h$, $CL_{\\mathrm{sys}}$, $F$, and $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{oral}}$ as above.\n- Compute the AUC fold-change relative to Case $1$ and round to three decimals.\n- Compute $\\overline{C}_{\\mathrm{avg}}$, $C_u$, $C_{\\mathrm{muscle}}$, $\\mathrm{Effect}$, and the boolean risk flag using $\\theta = 0.6$.\n- Output the results as a single bracketed, comma-separated list, interleaving fold-change and boolean per case.\n\nStep 7: Test suite coverage and edge conditions.\n- Case $1$ ($\\mathrm{REF}=1.0$) is the reference, establishing the baseline for fold-changes.\n- Case $2$ ($\\mathrm{REF}=0.5$) examines reduced uptake activity.\n- Case $3$ ($\\mathrm{REF}=0.1$) probes strong uptake deficiency producing uptake-limited clearance.\n- Case $4$ ($\\mathrm{REF}=0.0$) is the boundary condition of uptake-null, collapsing hepatic clearance to zero and leaving only renal clearance.\n- Case $5$ ($\\mathrm{REF}=2.0$) explores increased uptake activity approaching flow-limited behavior.\n\nThese steps coherently integrate IVIVE, PBPK organ clearance, and a parsimonious QSP effect model, all grounded in mass balance and standard pharmacokinetic principles.
