The enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), encoded by the *DPYD* gene, catalyzes the rate-limiting step of 5-fluorouracil catabolism. Interindividual variability in DPD activity is partly explained by genetic variation in *DPYD*.

Assign numeric values $1.0$ for normal function, $0.5$ for decreased function, and $0$ for no function.\n- The gene activity score $AS$ is computed by summing the allele-specific activity values across the two alleles: $AS = a_{1} + a_{2}$ for a diploid genotype.\n- Metabolizer phenotype categories are mapped to $AS$ as follows: normal metabolizer if $AS = 2.0$, intermediate metabolizer if $AS \\in \\{1.0, 1.5\\}$, and poor metabolizer if $AS \\in \\{0, 0.5\\}$.\n\nYou are provided the following genotype details:\n- One copy of $DPYD^{\\ast}2A$ (splice-site variant $c.1905+1G>A$), which is a no-function allele; therefore assign $a_{1} = 0$.\n- One copy of HapB3 (commonly tagged by $c.1236G>A$ in linkage with a structural haplotype), which is associated with decreased function in many clinical implementations; for this calculation, assume HapB3 is a decreased-function allele and assign $a_{2} = 0.5$.\n- No other *DPYD* variants of clinical relevance are present.\n\nUsing only the above additive model and assignments, compute the gene activity score $AS$ and predict the metabolizer status.

The formula is given as:\n$$\nAS = a_{1} + a_{2}\n$$\nwhere $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ are the numeric functional values assigned to the two alleles.\n\nThe problem provides the following assignments for allele function:\n- Normal function allele: value of $1.0$\n- Decreased function allele: value of $0.5$\n- No function allele: value of $0$\n\nThe patient's genotype is described as having two specific alleles:\n1.  One copy of $DPYD^{\\ast}2A$. This is explicitly defined as a no-function allele. Therefore, we assign its activity value, $a_{1}$, as:\n    $$\n    a_{1} = 0\n    $$\n2.  One copy of HapB3.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part response: first, the derivation of the relevant form of Bayes' theorem, and second, its application to compute a specific posterior probability.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Bayesian Expression\n\nWe are asked to derive the expression for the posterior probability $P(D \\mid U=u)$, where $D$ is a discrete binary state (deficiency) and $U$ is a continuous random variable representing a measurement (uracil concentration). We start from the fundamental definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nLet the event $A$ be the state $D$, and the event $B$ be the observation that the uracil concentration $U$ falls within an infinitesimally small interval $[u, u+du]$. We denote this event as $\\{u \\le U \\le u+du\\}$. The posterior probability is then the limit of $P(D \\mid u \\le U \\le u+du)$ as the interval width $du$ approaches $0$.\n\nApplying the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(D \\mid u \\le U \\le u+du) = \\frac{P(D \\cap \\{u \\le U \\le u+du\\})}{P(u \\le U \\le u+du)}$$\nThe joint probability in the numerator can be re-written using the definition of conditional probability again, $P(X \\cap Y) = P(X \\mid Y)P(Y)$:\n$$P(D \\cap \\{u \\le U \\le u+du\\}) = P(u \\le U \\le u+du \\mid D) P(D)$$\nThe probability that a continuous random variable $U$ falls into a small interval $[u, u+du]$ is related to its probability density function (PDF). Let $f_U(u)$ be the marginal PDF of $U$, and let $f(u \\mid D)$ and $f(u \\mid N)$ be the conditional PDFs of $U$ given the state is $D$ or its complement $N$, respectively. For a very small interval width $du$, we can make the following approximations:\n$$P(u \\le U \\le u+du) \\approx f_U(u) \\, du$$\n$$P(u \\le U \\le u+du \\mid D) \\approx f(u \\mid D) \\, du$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into our equation for the posterior probability:\n$$P(D \\mid u \\le U \\le u+du) \\approx \\frac{f(u \\mid D) \\, du \\cdot P(D)}{f_U(u) \\, du}$$\nThe term $du$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding:\n$$P(D \\mid U=u) = \\frac{f(u \\mid D) P(D)}{f_U(u)}$$\nThis is Bayes' theorem for a discrete state and a continuous observation. The term $f(u \\mid D)$ is the likelihood of observing the value $u$ given the state $D$. $P(D)$ is the prior probability of state $D$. The denominator $f_U(u)$ is the marginal PDF of the observation, often called the \"evidence\".\n\nTo make this expression fully operational, we expand the evidence term using the law of total probability. Since the states $D$ and $N$ are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (they form a partition of the event space), we can write the marginal PDF of $U$ as a weighted sum of the conditional PDFs:\n$$f_U(u) = f(u \\mid D) P(D) + f(u \\mid N) P(N)$$\nSubstituting this expansion into the denominator of Bayes' theorem gives the final form required for calculation:\n$$P(D \\mid U=u) = \\frac{f(u \\mid D) P(D)}{f(u \\mid D) P(D) + f(u \\mid N) P(N)}$$\nThis is the derived expression.\n\n### Part 2: Application and Calculation\n\nWe now apply this formula using the provided data.\nThe given information is:\n-   Prior probability of DPD deficiency: $P(D) = 0.72$\n-   Prior probability of not being deficient: $P(N) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.72 = 0.28$\n-   Observed uracil concentration: $u = 14 \\, \\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{mL}$\n-   The conditional distribution for $U$ given $D$ is Normal: $U \\mid D \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{D}, \\sigma_{D}^2)$ with $\\mu_{D} = 19$ and $\\sigma_{D} = 5$.\n-   The conditional distribution for $U$ given $N$ is Normal: $U \\mid N \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{N}, \\sigma_{N}^2)$ with $\\mu_{N} = 9$ and $\\sigma_{N} = 3$.\n\nThe PDF for a normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ is given by:\n$$f(x \\mid \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$$\nWe must calculate the likelihoods $f(u=14 \\mid D)$ and $f(u=14 \\mid N)$.\n\nLikelihood for the deficient state $D$:\n$$f(u=14 \\mid D) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_D\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(14 - \\mu_D)^2}{2\\sigma_D^2}\\right)$$\n$$f(u=14 \\mid D) = \\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(14 - 19)^2}{2 \\cdot 5^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(-5)^2}{50}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{25}{50}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp(-0.5)$$\nLikelihood for the non-deficient state $N$:\n$$f(u=14 \\mid N) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_N\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(14 - \\mu_N)^2}{2\\sigma_N^2}\\right)$$\n$$f(u=14 \\mid N) = \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(14 - 9)^2}{2 \\cdot 3^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{5^2}{18}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{25}{18}\\right)$$\nNow we substitute these likelihoods and the prior probabilities into the Bayesian formula:\n$$P(D \\mid U=14) = \\frac{f(14 \\mid D) P(D)}{f(14 \\mid D) P(D) + f(14 \\mid N) P(N)}$$\n$$P(D \\mid U=14) = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp(-0.5) \\right) (0.72)}{\\left( \\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp(-0.5) \\right) (0.72) + \\left( \\frac{1}{3\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{25}{18}\\right) \\right) (0.28)}$$\nThe constant factor $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}$ is present in all terms and can be cancelled:\n$$P(D \\mid U=14) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{5} \\exp(-0.5) \\cdot 0.72}{\\frac{1}{5} \\exp(-0.5) \\cdot 0.72 + \\frac{1}{3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{25}{18}\\right) \\cdot 0.28}$$\nWe proceed with the numerical calculation.\nLet the numerator be denoted by $\\mathcal{N'}$, and the two terms in the denominator be $\\mathcal{D'}_1$ and $\\mathcal{D'}_2$.\n$$\\mathcal{N'} = \\mathcal{D'}_1 = \\frac{0.72}{5} \\exp(-0.5) = 0.144 \\exp(-0.5)$$\n$$\\mathcal{D'}_2 = \\frac{0.28}{3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{25}{18}\\right)$$\nUsing the values $\\exp(-0.5) \\approx 0.60653066$ and $\\exp(-25/18) \\approx 0.24935240$:\n$$\\mathcal{N'} = 0.144 \\times 0.60653066 \\approx 0.087340416$$\n$$\\mathcal{D'}_2 = \\frac{0.28}{3} \\times 0.24935240 \\approx 0.09333333 \\times 0.24935240 \\approx 0.023272891$$\nThe posterior probability is:\n$$P(D \\mid U=14) = \\frac{\\mathcal{N'}}{\\mathcal{D'}_1 + \\mathcal{D'}_2} = \\frac{0.087340416}{0.087340416 + 0.023272891} = \\frac{0.087340416}{0.110613307} \\approx 0.7895999$$\nThe observed uracil value $u=14$ is between the two means $\\mu_N=9$ and $\\mu_D=19$.
