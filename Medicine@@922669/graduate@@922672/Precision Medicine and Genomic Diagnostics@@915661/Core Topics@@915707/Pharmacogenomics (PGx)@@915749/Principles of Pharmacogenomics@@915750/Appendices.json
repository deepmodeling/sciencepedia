A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe total CYP2D6 activity score, denoted $AS$, is calculated as the sum of the activity values of all alleles present in the patient's diplotype. The activity contribution of a set of identical alleles is the product of the number of copies of that allele and its assigned per-copy activity value.\n\nLet $v_N$, $v_D$, and $v_0$ be the per-copy activity values for normal, decreased, and no function alleles, respectively. From the givens, we have:\n-   $v_N = 1$\n-   $v_D = 0.5$\n-   $v_0 = 0$\n\nThe general formula for the activity score based on the number of copies of each allele type ($n_N$, $n_D$, $n_0$) is:\n$$AS = n_N \\cdot v_N + n_D \\cdot v_D + n_0 \\cdot v_0$$\n\nFrom the problem description of the patient's diplotype:\n-   There is \"one normal function allele (`*1`) present in a single copy\". This gives $n_N = 1$.\n-   There is \"one decreased function allele (`*41`) present in a duplicated state (two copies on one homologous chromosome, denoted `*41x2`)\". This means the total number of copies of the decreased function allele is $2$. This gives $n_D = 2$.\n-   There are no \"no function\" alleles mentioned in the diplotype. This gives $n_0 = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the activity score formula:\n$$AS = (1) \\cdot (1) + (2) \\cdot (0.5) + (0) \\cdot (0)$$\n$$AS = 1 + 1 + 0$$\n$$AS = 2$$\n\nThe calculated activity score is $AS = 2$.\n\nNext, we classify the metabolizer phenotype using the provided CPIC thresholds:\n-   Poor metabolizer: $AS = 0$\n-   Intermediate metabolizer: $0  AS \\le 1.25$\n-   Normal metabolizer: $1.25  AS \\le 2.25$\n-   Ultrarapid metabolizer: $AS > 2.25$\n\nSince our calculated score is $AS = 2$, and $2$ falls within the interval $(1.25, 2.25]$, the patient's predicted CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype is **Normal Metabolizer**.\n\nThe problem asks for the activity score $AS$ in the final answer.\nThe computed CYP2D6 activity score is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "4372948"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of an activity score, this next exercise demonstrates how this functional metric directly informs clinical decision-making.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to find a dose adjustment factor, which we will denote as $F_{dose}$, such that the Area Under the Curve (AUC) in the patient ($AUC_{pt}$) is equal to the AUC in the baseline extensive metabolizer ($AUC_{base}$). The dose for the patient is $D_{pt} = F_{dose} \\cdot D_{base}$, where $D_{base}$ is the original dose.\n\nFor an intravenous dose, the AUC is defined as the dose divided by the total body clearance ($CL$):\n$$AUC = \\frac{D}{CL}$$\nThe condition $AUC_{pt} = AUC_{base}$ can be written as:\n$$\\frac{D_{pt}}{CL_{pt}} = \\frac{D_{base}}{CL_{base}}$$\nSubstituting $D_{pt} = F_{dose} \\cdot D_{base}$:\n$$\\frac{F_{dose} \\cdot D_{base}}{CL_{pt}} = \\frac{D_{base}}{CL_{base}}$$\nSolving for the dose adjustment factor $F_{dose}$:\n$$F_{dose} = \\frac{CL_{pt}}{CL_{base}}$$\nThe problem now reduces to calculating the total clearance for the baseline case and the patient case. Since extrahepatic clearance is negligible, total clearance is equal to hepatic clearance, $CL = CL_h$.\n\nWe use the well-stirred model for hepatic clearance:\n$$CL_h = \\frac{Q_h \\cdot f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}$$\nwhere $Q_h$ is the hepatic blood flow, $f_u$ is the fraction unbound in blood, and $CL_{int}$ is the total intrinsic clearance.\n\n**1.

The fraction metabolized by CYP2C19 is $f_m = 0.70$.\n$$CL_{int,CYP2C19,base} = f_m \\cdot CL_{int,base} = 0.70 \\cdot 300~\\text{L/h} = 210~\\text{L/h}$$\nThe remaining intrinsic clearance is from other pathways:\n$$CL_{int,non-CYP} = (1 - f_m) \\cdot CL_{int,base} = (1 - 0.70) \\cdot 300~\\text{L/h} = 0.30 \\cdot 300~\\text{L/h} = 90~\\text{L/h}$$\nThe non-CYP2C19 pathways are unaffected in the patient.\n\nNext, we calculate the patient's CYP2C19 intrinsic clearance, $CL_{int,CYP2C19,pt}$. This is affected by both the genotype and the inhibitor.\n-   The loss-of-function genotype reduces the clearance to $10\\%$ of the baseline, which corresponds to a multiplicative factor of $0.10$.\n-   The competitive inhibitor reduces the clearance by a factor of $(1 + [I]_u/K_i)$. With $[I]_u/K_i = 9$, this factor is $1 + 9 = 10$. The resulting multiplicative factor is $\\frac{1}{10} = 0.10$.\nSince the effects are multiplicative:\n$$CL_{int,CYP2C19,pt} = CL_{int,CYP2C19,base} \\cdot (\\text{genotype factor}) \\cdot (\\text{inhibition factor})$$\n$$CL_{int,CYP2C19,pt} = 210~\\text{L/h} \\cdot 0.10 \\cdot \\frac{1}{1+9} = 210 \\cdot 0.10 \\cdot 0.10 = 2.1~\\text{L/h}$$\nThe total intrinsic clearance for the patient is the sum of the modified CYP2C19 clearance and the unchanged non-CYP clearance:\n$$CL_{int,pt} = CL_{int,CYP2C19,pt} + CL_{int,non-CYP} = 2.1~\\text{L/h} + 90~\\text{L/h} = 92.1~\\text{L/h}$$\n\n**3. Calculate Patient Clearance ($CL_{pt}$)**\nUsing the well-stirred model with the patient's intrinsic clearance, and noting that $Q_h$ and $f_u$ are unchanged:\n$$CL_{pt} = \\frac{Q_h \\cdot f_u \\cdot CL_{int,pt}}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int,pt}}$$\n$$CL_{pt} = \\frac{90 \\cdot 0.10 \\cdot 92.1}{90 + 0.10 \\cdot 92.1} = \\frac{9 \\cdot 92.1}{90 + 9.21} = \\frac{828.9}{99.21}~\\text{L/h}$$\n$$CL_{pt} \\approx 8.3550045~\\text{L/h}$$\n\n**4. Calculate the Dose Adjustment Factor ($F_{dose}$)**\nFinally, we compute the ratio of the clearances:\n$$F_{dose} = \\frac{CL_{pt}}{CL_{base}} = \\frac{828.9 / 99.21}{22.5} \\approx \\frac{8.3550045}{22.5} \\approx 0.3713335$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.3713$.
