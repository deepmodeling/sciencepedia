Mastering this practice is essential for planning studies that are both scientifically sound and resource-efficient.", "problem": "A sponsor is preparing a Premarket Approval (PMA) submission to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a companion diagnostic (CDx) in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay that detects an actionable genomic alteration to direct therapy selection. The clinical performance endpoint of interest is the sensitivity of the assay, defined as the probability that the test returns a positive result given that the reference standard confirms the presence of the target condition. In accordance with regulatory expectations for precision medicine and genomic diagnostics, the sponsor seeks to design the disease-positive cohort size to ensure that the two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval for sensitivity has a half-width strictly less than $0.025$. Assume sensitivity is estimated from $n$ independent, disease-positive subjects under a fixed but unknown true sensitivity parameter.\n\nUsing only first-principles reasoning grounded in the binomial model for diagnostic outcomes and large-sample approximations justified by the Central Limit Theorem, derive the condition on $n$ required to guarantee the stated confidence interval half-width for all possible true sensitivity values in the open interval $(0,1)$, and then compute the minimal integer $n$ that satisfies this guarantee. Clearly state and justify all modeling assumptions invoked, including independence, identically distributed outcomes, and the conservativeness of any bounding arguments used. Express your final numerical answer as the minimal integer count of disease-positive subjects required.

Under standard diagnostic accuracy study design, the number of true test-positive results among $n$ disease-positive subjects, $X$, follows a binomial distribution:\n$$\nX \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p).\n$$\nThe natural estimator of sensitivity is the sample proportion\n$$\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{X}{n}.\n$$\nBy the Central Limit Theorem for binomial proportions (a consequence of the Lindeberg–Feller conditions and the fact that $X$ is a sum of independent Bernoulli$(p)$ trials), for large $n$,\n$$\n\\frac{\\hat{p} - p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}} \\approx Z,\n$$\nwhere $Z$ is standard normal. This yields the familiar large-sample two-sided Wald-type confidence interval for $p$ centered at $\\hat{p}$ with half-width approximately\n$$\nH(p, n) \\approx z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}},\n$$\nwhere for a two-sided $95\\%$ confidence level we have $\\alpha = 0.05$ and thus $z_{1-\\alpha/2} = z_{0.975}$, the $0.975$ quantile of the standard normal distribution.\n\nThe regulatory design goal is to ensure the half-width is strictly less than a target $h = 0.025$ for all possible true sensitivity values $p \\in (0,1)$. Because $p$ is unknown at the design stage, we require a bound that guarantees\n$$\nH(p, n) < h \\quad \\text{for all } p \\in (0,1).\n$$\nObserve that $p(1-p)$ is maximized at $p = 0.5$, with\n$$\n\\max_{p \\in (0,1)} p(1-p) = \\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nTherefore, a sufficient condition that guarantees $H(p, n) < h$ for all $p \\in (0,1)$ is to impose\n$$\nz_{0.975} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{n}} < h,\n$$\nwhich simplifies to\n$$\nz_{0.975} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4n}} < h \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4n}} < \\frac{h}{z_{0.975}} \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\frac{1}{4n} < \\left(\\frac{h}{z_{0.975}}\\right)^{2}.\n$$\nRearranging yields the design inequality\n$$\nn > \\frac{z_{0.975}^{2}}{4 h^{2}}.\n$$\n\nAssumptions and justifications:\n- Independence and identically distributed outcomes: Each disease-positive subject contributes an independent Bernoulli$(p)$ outcome under a stable assay and reference standard, which is appropriate when specimens and testing conditions do not induce correlation and the sensitivity parameter $p$ is homogeneous across the enrolled population. This matches standard FDA expectations for primary performance estimation in a prespecified population.\n- Binomial model: With $n$ disease-positive subjects and independent test outcomes, $X$ is binomial, which is the canonical model for sensitivity estimation in IVD accuracy studies.\n- Large-sample normal approximation: The Central Limit Theorem justifies the normal approximation to $\\hat{p}$ for sufficiently large $n$. The planning step enforces large $n$ to achieve the desired precision, validating the approximation.\n- Conservativeness via worst-case variance: Because $p$ is unknown, using $\\max_{p} p(1-p) = 1/4$ ensures the half-width constraint holds uniformly over $p \\in (0,1)$. This yields a conservative design acceptable in regulatory contexts where guarantees independent of the realized $p$ are preferable.\n\nWe now compute the minimal integer $n$ satisfying the inequality using $h = 0.025$ and $z_{0.975} = 1.96$:\n$$\nn > \\frac{(1.96)^{2}}{4 \\times (0.025)^{2}}.\n$$\nCompute the numerator and denominator:\n$$\n(1.96)^{2} = 3.8416, \\quad (0.025)^{2} = 0.000625, \\quad 4 \\times (0.000625) = 0.0025.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\nn > \\frac{3.8416}{0.0025} = 1536.64.\n$$\nBecause $n$ must be an integer and must strictly exceed $1536.64$ to make the half-width strictly less than $0.025$, the minimal integer satisfying the guarantee is\n$$\nn = 1537.\n$$\n\nA quick check of the achieved half-width under the worst-case variance confirms the design:\n$$\nH_{\\max}(n) \\approx z_{0.975} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4n}} = 1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4 \\times 1537}} \\approx 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{6148}} \\approx 1.96 \\times 0.01275 \\approx 0.0250,\n$$\nwhich, with the strict inequality enforced by choosing $n = 1537$ (so the computed threshold $1536.64$ is exceeded), ensures $H_{\\max}(n) < 0.025$ under the continuous approximation.

Version control and configuration management: cryptographically hashed source control with immutable tags; containerized runtime images with content-addressable digests; complete Software Bill of Materials and infrastructure-as-code to reproduce the compute environment. Read alignment: a fixed, alt-aware aligner version pinned with identical scoring parameters across runs; reference genome build fixed to GRCh38 with decoy and alternate contigs; sample-specific Unique Molecular Identifier handling locked. Variant calling: separate, pinned versions for single-nucleotide variant and insertion–deletion callers; training and threshold selection performed on an independent training dataset stratified by variant class and genomic context; final validation on an independent validation set that includes Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) samples, cell-line admixtures spanning variant allele fraction from $1\\%$ to $50\\%$, and Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) samples to assess deamination artifacts; prespecified acceptance criteria per variant class and context. Filtering and quality modeling: calibration on the training set to choose a decision threshold that preserves measured $s = 0.98$ and achieves $\\text{PPV} \\ge 0.90$ at $p = 0.12$ by ensuring $\\text{specificity} \\ge 0.986$ (set to exceed the minimum by margin to account for uncertainty); no use of runtime internet resources at analysis time. Clinical annotation: all knowledge sources (for example, ClinVar and COSMIC) are frozen as time-stamped snapshots with archived checksums and documented curation rules; no live queries; reporting logic documented and locked. Performance monitoring and change control: statistical process control (SPC) with Shewhart $3\\sigma$ limits for key metrics (for example, mean on-target coverage, duplicate rate, and callable genome fraction), periodic proficiency testing, and field controls; predefined change classification (major versus minor) with triggers for regression testing and bridging studies; any pipeline component change (alignment parameters, caller version, reference build, or annotation snapshot) requires re-verification, impact assessment, and if applicable a PMA supplement.\n\nB. Version control and configuration management: branch-based versioning without immutable tags; dependencies float to latest patch versions; cloud-based alignment service is allowed to update transparently. Read alignment: alignment to GRCh38, but annotation uses GRCh37 transcript coordinates with liftover at runtime. Variant calling: thresholds tuned by maximizing the F1 score on a single GIAB sample used for both training and validation. Filtering and quality modeling: PPV requirements are not modeled against the intended use population prevalence; the same threshold is applied across all variant classes; runtime annotation calls out to current internet resources to fetch latest evidence. Clinical annotation: live queries to external knowledge bases are permitted to ensure most current labels. Performance monitoring and change control: rolling “agile” updates are deployed monthly without regression testing; deviations from expected quality metrics are inspected only if they exceed historical means by $2\\sigma$.\n\nC. Version control and configuration management: pipeline is containerized, but reference data and annotation sources are mounted from a shared network drive that updates nightly to the latest releases. Read alignment: reads are aligned to GRCh37 for historical comparability while annotation is performed on GRCh38, with coordinates remapped on the fly; alternative contigs are ignored. Variant calling: sensitivity is emphasized, validated solely on simulated reads and a single clinical specimen; no stratification by genomic context. Filtering and quality modeling: thresholds are tuned to maximize sensitivity and negative predictive value; PPV is not evaluated against the intended use population; in low-prevalence settings, specificity is allowed to be as low as $0.95$. Clinical annotation: the knowledge base is updated continuously; reports may differ when reissued because annotations change. Performance monitoring and change control: quality metrics are tracked, with alerts at $2\\sigma$; updates to the aligner are considered “minor” and do not trigger regression testing.\n\nD.

Read alignment: fixed aligner version and GRCh38 reference build. Variant calling: training and validation performed on independent datasets with stratification; acceptance criteria prespecified. Filtering and quality modeling: the sponsor derives a minimum specificity of approximately $0.95$ to achieve $\\text{PPV} \\ge 0.90$ at $p = 0.12$ given $s = 0.98$, and sets the filter accordingly; PPV is stated to be “largely insensitive” to prevalence in this range. Clinical annotation: a weekly synchronization to external databases is performed, with a monthly snapshot archived; reports are reissued if upstream annotations change.

All terminology (CDx, PMA, NGS, EGFR, GRCh38, GIAB, FFPE, PPV, etc.) is standard and used correctly. The scenario of developing and validating a bioinformatics pipeline for a CDx under FDA review is a realistic and common challenge in precision medicine.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary numerical data ($p$, $s$, and the target PPV) to calculate the minimum required specificity. It also provides a clear, objective standard for evaluation: \"FDA expectations for a locked, reproducible CDx bioinformatics pipeline.\" This standard is based on established regulatory principles.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language. The evaluation criteria are based on established regulatory and scientific best practices, not subjective preferences.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective, with a complete and consistent setup. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe first step is to calculate the minimum required specificity ($\\text{sp}$) to achieve the target Positive Predictive Value ($\\text{PPV}$). The standard formula for $\\text{PPV}$ as a function of prevalence ($p$), sensitivity ($s$), and specificity ($\\text{sp}$) is derived from Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet $D+$ be the event that a patient has the actionable variant, and $T+$ be the event that the assay returns a positive result.\n-   Prevalence: $P(D+) = p = 0.12$. Consequently, $P(D-) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88$.\n-   Sensitivity: $P(T+|D+) = s = 0.98$.\n-   Specificity: $P(T-|D-) = \\text{sp}$. Therefore, the false positive rate is $P(T+|D-) = 1 - \\text{sp}$.\n\nThe $\\text{PPV}$ is the probability that a patient truly has the variant given a positive test result, i.e., $P(D+|T+)$. Using the definition of conditional probability and the law of total probability:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D+|T+) = \\frac{P(T+|D+)P(D+)}{P(T+)} = \\frac{P(T+|D+)P(D+)}{P(T+|D+)P(D+) + P(T+|D-)P(D-)} $$\nSubstituting the variable names:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{s \\cdot p}{s \\cdot p + (1 - \\text{sp})(1 - p)} $$\n\nWe are given the constraint $\\text{PPV} \\geq 0.90$ and the values $s=0.98$ and $p=0.12$. We must solve for the minimum $\\text{sp}$.\n$$ 0.90 \\leq \\frac{(0.98)(0.12)}{(0.98)(0.12) + (1 - \\text{sp})(1 - 0.12)} $$\n$$ 0.90 \\leq \\frac{0.1176}{0.1176 + (1 - \\text{sp})(0.88)} $$\nTo solve for $\\text{sp}$, we can rearrange the inequality:\n$$ 0.90 \\cdot [0.1176 + 0.88(1 - \\text{sp})] \\leq 0.1176 $$\n$$ 0.10584 + 0.792(1 - \\text{sp}) \\leq 0.1176 $$\n$$ 0.792(1 - \\text{sp}) \\leq 0.1176 - 0.10584 $$\n$$ 0.792(1 - \\text{sp}) \\leq 0.01176 $$\n$$ 1 - \\text{sp} \\leq \\frac{0.01176}{0.792} $$\n$$ 1 - \\text{sp} \\leq 0.014848... $$\n$$ \\text{sp} \\geq 1 - 0.014848... $$\n$$ \\text{sp} \\geq 0.985151... $$\nTherefore, the minimum required specificity is approximately $0.9852$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nThe evaluation criterion is the satisfaction of FDA expectations for a locked, reproducible, and rigorously validated CDx bioinformatics pipeline, along with the correct application of performance metric constraints.\n\n**A. Version control and configuration management: ...**\n-   **Technical Soundness:** This option describes a state-of-the-art, regulatory-compliant V&V strategy. Key elements include:\n    -   **Locking and Reproducibility:** Cryptographic hashing, immutable tags, containerization with content-addressable digests, and infrastructure-as-code ensure that the entire pipeline (code, data, environment) is fixed and fully reproducible. This is the cornerstone of FDA expectations for software in a medical device.\n    -   **Rigorous Validation:** It correctly advocates for independent training and validation datasets, stratification by variant class, inclusion of challenging and representative sample types (GIAB, admixtures, FFPE), and prespecified acceptance criteria. This methodology counters overfitting and provides a robust estimate of real-world performance.\n    -   **Correct Filtering Threshold:** It states that the filtering threshold is chosen to ensure specificity $\\ge 0.986$. This value correctly exceeds the calculated minimum requirement of $0.9852$, demonstrating a correct derivation and the good practice of adding a safety margin.\n    -   **Annotation Control:** Freezing knowledge sources as time-stamped snapshots prevents a leading cause of non-reproducibility in variant interpretation.\n    -   **Change Control:** The plan for postmarket monitoring using SPC, predefined change classification, and mandatory re-verification for any component change represents a mature and compliant change control process.\n\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option holistically addresses all critical aspects of regulatory compliance for a CDx IVD bioinformatics pipeline and correctly applies the performance constraints.\n\n**B. Version control and configuration management: ...**\n-   **Technical Soundness:** This option details a series of practices that are antithetical to regulatory requirements.\n    -   **Locking and Reproducibility:** \"Floating\" dependencies, lack of immutable tags, and transparently updating services create a non-deterministic, non-reproducible pipeline. Liftover between reference builds at runtime is error-prone and introduces variability.\n    -   **Rigorous Validation:** Using a single sample for both training and validation is a critical methodological flaw that leads to invalid performance estimates.\n    -   **Correct Filtering Threshold:** Ignoring the intended use population prevalence when evaluating PPV is a fundamental statistical error. PPV is highly dependent on prevalence. Runtime calls to internet resources violate the \"locked\" principle.\n    -   **Change Control:** \"Agile\" updates without regression testing and weak alerts ($2\\sigma$ threshold) constitute a dangerously lax change control system.\n\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This strategy is fundamentally flawed and would be rejected by regulators.\n\n**C. Version control and configuration management: ...**\n-   **Technical Soundness:** This option contains multiple critical flaws.\n    -   **Locking and Reproducibility:** Mounting data from a nightly-updating network drive makes the pipeline non-reproducible by design. The results would change depending on the day the analysis is run. Mismatched reference builds with on-the-fly remapping is poor practice.\n    -   **Rigorous Validation:** Validation using only simulated reads and a single clinical specimen is insufficient for a CDx.\n    -   **Correct Filtering Threshold:** The claim that specificity can be as low as $0.95$ is demonstrably false. As shown in a supplemental calculation, a specificity of $0.95$ would yield a PPV of approximately $0.73$, far below the required $0.90$. Focusing on negative predictive value at the expense of PPV is inappropriate for a test designed to select patients *for* a therapy.\n    -   **Change Control:** Considering an aligner update \"minor\" is incorrect; such a change can have a profound impact on variant calls and requires major re-validation.\n\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This strategy is non-compliant, methodologically weak, and based on an incorrect calculation of the required specificity.\n\n**D. Version control and configuration management: ...**\n-   **Technical Soundness:** While some aspects appear sound initially (e.g., containerization), this option contains disqualifying errors.\n    -   **Correct Filtering Threshold:** The derivation of a minimum specificity of approximately $0.95$ is a critical calculation error. The correct value is $\\approx 0.9852$. Setting the filter based on this incorrect value would fail to meet the required PPV of $0.90$.\n    -   **Scientific Understanding:** The statement that \"PPV is largely insensitive to prevalence in this range\" is factually incorrect and demonstrates a dangerous misunderstanding of diagnostic test performance characteristics. PPV is strongly dependent on prevalence.\n    -   **Locking and Reproducibility:** Weekly synchronization of databases, even with monthly archives, creates a \"rolling\" definition of the test that is inconsistent with the locked-down nature of a PMA-approved device.\n    -   **Change Control:** The assertion that changes to annotation sources do not require re-verification is a major compliance failure. The annotation and interpretation of variants are integral parts of the diagnostic test; changing them alters the device's output and clinical meaning.\n\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The strategy is invalidated by a critical calculation error, a fundamental misunderstanding of test metrics, and an inadequate change control policy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4338891"}, {"introduction": "A technically flawless and rigorously validated diagnostic can still fail to meet regulatory compliance if its intended use is not properly managed.

It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, or ill-posed. It is a substantive problem requiring a nuanced application of regulatory principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A full analysis of the scenario and a subsequent evaluation of each option will be performed.\n\n### Solution and Option Analysis\n\nThe analysis proceeds by applying the provided regulatory principles to the facts of the scenario.\n\n1.  **Determination of \"Intended Use\" and Device Status:**\n    GenomicaX labels HaloSeq as RUO. However, according to 21 CFR 801.4, \"intended use\" is determined by objective evidence, not solely by the label. The actions of GenomicaX constitute strong evidence of an objective intent for clinical diagnostic use:\n    -   Providing application notes for \"therapy selection.\"\n    -   Hosting seminars with \"patient outcome\" case reports.\n    -   Providing support for \"reporting practices for patient specimens.\"\n    -   Having knowledge of the kit's use in \"treatment decisions.\"\n    These actions violate the restrictions on RUO products laid out in 21 CFR 809.10(c)(2)(i), which prohibit a manufacturer from representing or providing support that evidences an objective intent for clinical diagnostic use. Therefore, despite the RUO label, the FDA would regulate HaloSeq as an in vitro diagnostic device under FDCA Section 201(h) due to its intended use.\n\n2.  **Inapplicability of LDT Enforcement Discretion:**\n    While OncoCore operates as a CLIA lab, the test it performs is not a traditional LDT for which FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion. A key component, the HaloSeq kit, is commercially manufactured and distributed by an external entity, GenomicaX. Crucially, the principle provided states that FDA's LDT enforcement discretion \"does not extend to manufacturers promoting RUO products for clinical diagnostic use.\" GenomicaX's active promotion of HaloSeq for clinical applications disqualifies this arrangement from a claim to LDT status.\n\n3.  **Companion Diagnostic (CDx) Classification:**\n    The OncoCore report states the test \"supports use of Drug X in accordance with its approved labeling.\" According to the FDA's 2014 guidance, a device that is essential for the safe and effective use of a therapeutic is a CDx. By explicitly linking the test result to the use of a specific drug, the test is functioning as a CDx. This is further reinforced by GenomicaX's promotion for \"therapy selection\" and the drug sponsor's use of the test report. CDx devices are typically high-risk and require the most stringent form of FDA premarket review, a PMA, or at minimum a 510(k) clearance.\n\n4.  **Regulatory Violations:**\n    Because HaloSeq is a device with a clinical diagnostic (and CDx) intended use, it requires premarket review (PMA or 510(k)). GenomicaX has not obtained this. By introducing HaloSeq into interstate commerce, GenomicaX has violated the FDCA. Under Section 501(f)(1)(B), the device is **adulterated** because it is a Class III device (as most CDx are) without an approved PMA. It is also **misbranded** under Section 502(o) for failing to have the required premarket notification or approval.\n\n5.  **Enforcement Risks:**\n    GenomicaX, as the manufacturer, faces significant enforcement risk, including regulatory correspondence (e.g., Form FDA 483 inspectional observations, Warning Letters), and more severe actions like product seizure, injunctions, and civil or criminal penalties. OncoCore also faces risk for its role in using and promoting an unapproved device for clinical care, particularly in its collaboration with GenomicaX.\n\nBased on this derivation, each option is evaluated.\n\n**A. GenomicaX’s conduct evidences objective intent for clinical diagnostic use despite RUO labeling, so HaloSeq is an unapproved in vitro diagnostic device introduced into interstate commerce, rendering it adulterated under FDCA Section 501(f)(1)(B) and misbranded under FDCA Section 502(o). Enforcement risks include Warning Letters, product seizure, and injunction.**\nThis statement is a precise summary of the regulatory analysis. GenomicaX's actions establish objective intent for clinical use, overriding the RUO label. This makes HaloSeq an unapproved device. Shipping it in interstate commerce without approval constitutes adulteration and misbranding under the specified FDCA sections. The listed enforcement actions are standard remedies available to the FDA.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because OncoCore is CLIA-certified and performed internal validation, RUO labeling is sufficient to allow patient testing without FDA premarket review, and neither GenomicaX nor OncoCore faces FDA enforcement risk.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As explicitly stated in the provided principles, CLIA certification does not substitute for FDA premarket review of a device. The RUO label is invalidated by the manufacturer's promotional activities, and the test does not qualify for LDT enforcement discretion. Significant enforcement risk exists for both parties.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. RUO labeling categorically insulates the manufacturer from device regulation regardless of promotion or support activities, so GenomicaX’s marketing and technical assistance do not affect the regulatory status.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It directly contradicts the principle of objective intent (21 CFR 801.4) and the specific limitations on RUO products (21 CFR 809.10(c)(2)(i)). A manufacturer's actions, not just its label, determine the intended use and regulatory status of a product.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. By enabling therapy selection based on test results and referencing approved drug labeling, the test functions as an in vitro companion diagnostic under FDA’s framework; absent PMA or 510(k) clearance, GenomicaX has marketed a device that requires premarket review, creating misbranding and adulteration risks and exposure to enforcement actions such as Form FDA 483 observations, Warning Letters, and import detentions.**\nThis statement is also a precise summary of a key aspect of the analysis. The test's function in therapy selection and its link to \"Drug X\" squarely place it in the CDx category. As a CDx, it requires premarket review. Lacking this, its marketing leads to adulteration and misbranding. The listed enforcement actions are all appropriate and plausible consequences.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. The described conduct triggers only Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) requirements; because no investigational plan or Institutional Review Board (IRB) oversight was pursued, the sole violation is failure to comply with IDE regulations, and RUO labeling otherwise remains appropriate for patient testing.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The issue is not the failure to properly conduct a clinical investigation; the issue is the illicit commercialization and clinical use of an unapproved device. An IDE is for investigational use, not routine clinical use. Claiming this is the \"sole violation\" is a mischaracterization of the primary offenses, which are adulteration and misbranding due to a lack of premarket approval for a commercially distributed device.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBoth options A and D correctly describe the regulatory violations and risks based on the provided scenario and principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "4338845"}]}
