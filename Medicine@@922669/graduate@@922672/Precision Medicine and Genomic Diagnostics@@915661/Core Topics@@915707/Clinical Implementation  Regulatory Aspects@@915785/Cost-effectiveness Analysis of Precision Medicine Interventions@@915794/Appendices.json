In this framework:\n\n- The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) is defined conceptually as the additional cost per additional unit of health gained when moving from the comparator to the intervention. Formally, for strictly positive incremental effectiveness, this is represented by\n$$\nICER = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E}.\n$$\nThis follows directly from the notion of cost per unit of effectiveness, where the numerator is the incremental cost and the denominator is the incremental effectiveness.\n\n- The Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) is derived from monetizing health gains at the threshold $k$ and subtracting incremental costs. It embodies the decision-theoretic principle of maximizing expected net benefit, given linear trade-offs between money and health valued at $k$. The standard expression is\n$$\nNMB = k \\,\\Delta E - \\Delta C.\n$$\nThis arises from valuing the health gain $\\Delta E$ at $k$ monetary units per QALY and then deducting the incremental cost $\\Delta C$ to obtain the net benefit in monetary units.\n\nThe decision rule is to adopt the intervention if it increases expected net benefit at threshold $k$, i.e., if $NMB \\ge 0$. Under strictly positive $\\Delta E$, this is equivalent to $ICER \\le k$, since\n$$\nNMB \\ge 0 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad k \\,\\Delta E - \\Delta C \\ge 0 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} \\le k \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad ICER \\le k,\n$$\nprovided $\\Delta E  0$.\n\nWe now substitute the given values:\n- $\\Delta C = 15000$,\n- $\\Delta E = 0.2$,\n- $k = 100000$.\n\nCompute the ICER:\n$$\nICER = \\frac{15000}{0.2} = 75000.\n$$\n\nCompute the NMB:\n$$\nNMB = 100000 \\times 0.2 - 15000 = 20000 - 15000 = 5000.\n$$\n\nApply the decision rule.

Expected Discounted Costs**\n\nSimilarly, total expected discounted costs, $C$, are calculated. Let $c = [c_{\\text{PF}}, c_{\\text{P}}, c_{\\text{D}}]$ be the vector of monthly costs associated with each state. The expected cost in cycle $t$ is:\n$$E[c_t] = p_t \\cdot c^T = \\sum_{i \\in \\{\\text{PF, P, D}\\}} p_{t,i} \\cdot c_i$$\nThese costs are discounted using the annual cost discount rate $r_C$. The discount factor for cycle $t$ is $(1+r_C)^{-t/12}$. The discounted cost for cycle $t$ is:\n$$\\text{Cost}_t = (p_t \\cdot c^T) \\cdot (1+r_C)^{-t/12}$$\nThe total expected discounted cost is the sum of the discounted cycle costs plus any one-time costs at $t=0$, which are undiscounted. For the targeted therapy arm, there is a one-time genomic diagnostic cost, $C_{\\text{onetime}}$.\n$$C = C_{\\text{onetime}} + \\sum_{t=1}^{H} \\text{Cost}_t$$\nFor the standard care arm, $C_{\\text{onetime}} = 0$.\n\n**3. Incremental Net Monetary Benefit (NMB)**\n\nThe cost-effectiveness of the targeted therapy relative to standard care is assessed using the Incremental Net Monetary Benefit ($\\Delta\\text{NMB}$). The NMB for a given treatment is defined as the monetized value of its health benefits minus its costs. Given a willingness-to-pay threshold $k$ per QALY, the NMB is:\n$$\\text{NMB} = k \\cdot Q - C$$\nThe $\\Delta\\text{NMB}$ compares the NMB of the targeted therapy ($T$) to that of standard care ($S$):\n$$\\Delta\\text{NMB} = \\text{NMB}_T - \\text{NMB}_S = (k \\cdot Q_T - C_T) - (k \\cdot Q_S - C_S)$$\nA positive $\\Delta\\text{NMB}$ indicates that the additional benefits of the targeted therapy are worth its additional costs, making it the preferred strategy at the given willingness-to-pay threshold.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure is as follows:\nFor each treatment arm (Targeted and Standard):\n1.  Initialize total discounted QALYs to $0$ and total discounted costs to the value of any one-time costs at $t=0$.\n2.  Initialize the state probability vector $p_{\\text{current}} = p_0 = [1, 0, 0]$.\n3.  Loop for $t$ from $1$ to $60$:\n    a.  Update the state probability vector: $p_{\\text{current}} \\leftarrow p_{\\text{current}} M$.\n    b.  Calculate the expected utility for the cycle and accumulate the discounted QALYs to the total.\n    c.  Calculate the expected cost for the cycle and accumulate the discounted cost to the total.\n4.  After the loop, the final totals represent $Q_T, C_T$ or $Q_S, C_S$.\n5.  Use these values to calculate $\\Delta\\text{NMB}$ with the specified $k = 100000$.\nThis process is repeated for each of the four test cases provided.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2.909062  2.658252  2374.004920 \\\\ 2.658252  2.658252  -107119.559987 \\\\ 2.979051  2.709920  23513.064516 \\\\ 2.441110  2.127827  -50090.264184 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4328850"}]}
