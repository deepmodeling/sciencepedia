To manage such incidental or secondary findings, the laboratory must decide whether to report a positive result for this gene-disease association based on the expected benefit versus harm of acting on the result.\n\nAssume the following are known and have been validated in the relevant population:\n- The pre-test probability of truly having the actionable disease phenotype is $\\pi = 0.005$.\n- The assay calls “positive” when the pipeline classifies the gene-disease association as present, with sensitivity $Se = 0.9$ and specificity $Sp = 0.995$.\n- The cost of a false positive (FP), denoted $C_{FP}$, is $C_{FP} = 1$ in normalized utility units (dimensionless).\n- The cost of a false negative (FN), denoted $C_{FN}$, is $C_{FN} = 5$ in normalized utility units (dimensionless).\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and Bayes’ theorem for conditional probability, first derive the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of the positive assay result, $PPV = P(\\text{disease} \\mid \\text{positive})$.\n\nThen, using first principles of decision theory, define the reporting decision threshold as the point at which the expected loss of acting on a positive result equals the expected loss of not acting.

The concepts of pre-test probability (prevalence), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and utility/cost analysis are standard in the evaluation of diagnostic and screening tests. The numerical values provided are realistic for a genetic test for a rare condition.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a complete set of unambiguous data and clear objectives: first, to derive the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), and second, to calculate a net utility difference based on that PPV and given costs. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution can be determined from the provided information.\n- **Objective:** The problem is formulated using precise, objective, and standard terminology of the field. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, unambiguous, and complete. It is therefore deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nLet $D$ be the event that a person has the actionable disease phenotype, and let $D^c$ be the event that the person does not. The pre-test probability, or prevalence, is given as $P(D) = \\pi = 0.005$. The probability of not having the disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - \\pi = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995$.\n\nLet $T$ be the event of a positive assay result, and $T^c$ be the event of a negative result. The test characteristics are given as:\n- Sensitivity: $Se = P(T|D) = 0.9$. This is the probability of a positive test given the disease is present.\n- Specificity: $Sp = P(T^c|D^c) = 0.995$. This is the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent.\n\nFrom specificity, we can find the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given the disease is absent:\n$P(T|D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.995 = 0.005$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\nThe Positive Predictive Value, $PPV$, is the probability that a person has the disease given that they received a positive test result, i.e., $P(D|T)$. We use Bayes' theorem to find this value:\n$$PPV = P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T)}$$\nFirst, we must calculate the total probability of a positive test, $P(T)$, using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(T) = (Se \\times \\pi) + ((1 - Sp) \\times (1 - \\pi))$$\n$$P(T) = (0.9 \\times 0.005) + (0.005 \\times 0.995)$$\n$$P(T) = 0.0045 + 0.004975 = 0.009475$$\nNow we can compute the $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\times \\pi}{P(T)} = \\frac{0.9 \\times 0.005}{0.009475} = \\frac{0.0045}{0.009475}$$\nThe exact fractional value is $PPV = \\frac{4500}{9475} = \\frac{180}{379}$. The probability of a false positive, given a positive test, is $P(D^c|T) = 1 - P(D|T) = 1 - PPV$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Net Utility Difference (U)**\nThe decision to act or not act is made *after* a positive result is observed. Therefore, all calculations are conditional on the event $T$. Utility is the negative of loss ($U = -L$). The net utility difference, $U$, between acting and not acting is defined as $U = U_{\\text{act}} - U_{\\text{not act}} = (-L_{\\text{act}}) - (-L_{\\text{not act}}) = L_{\\text{not act}} - L_{\\text{act}}$, where $L$ denotes the expected loss.\n\n1.  **Expected Loss of Acting on the Positive Result ($L_{\\text{act}}$):**\n    If we act, we proceed as if the patient has the disease. A loss is incurred only if this is incorrect, i.e., if the positive test was a false positive. The probability of this is $P(D^c|T) = 1-PPV$.\n    The cost of a false positive is $C_{FP} = 1$.\n    The cost of a true positive (acting correctly) is assumed to be $0$.\n    $$L_{\\text{act}} = (C_{FP} \\times P(D^c|T)) + (0 \\times P(D|T)) = C_{FP} \\times (1 - PPV)$$\n\n2.  **Expected Loss of Not Acting on the Positive Result ($L_{\\text{not act}}$):**\n    If we do not act, we proceed as if the patient does not have the disease, effectively ignoring the positive test result. A loss is incurred only if the patient truly has the disease, which corresponds to a false negative *decision*. The probability of this is $P(D|T) = PPV$.\n    The cost of a false negative is $C_{FN} = 5$.\n    The cost of a true negative (not acting when the patient is disease-free) is assumed to be $0$.\n    $$L_{\\text{not act}} = (C_{FN} \\times P(D|T)) + (0 \\times P(D^c|T)) = C_{FN} \\times PPV$$\n\nThe net utility difference $U$ is:\n$$U = L_{\\text{not act}} - L_{\\text{act}} = (C_{FN} \\times PPV) - (C_{FP} \\times (1 - PPV))$$\nSubstituting the values and the expression for $PPV$:\n$$U = \\left(5 \\times \\frac{0.0045}{0.009475}\\right) - \\left(1 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{0.0045}{0.009475}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$U = \\frac{5 \\times 0.0045}{0.009475} - \\frac{0.009475 - 0.0045}{0.009475}$$\n$$U = \\frac{0.0225}{0.009475} - \\frac{0.004975}{0.009475}$$\n$$U = \\frac{0.0225 - 0.004975}{0.009475} = \\frac{0.017525}{0.009475}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$U \\approx 1.8496042216...$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$U \\approx 1.850$$\nSince $U > 0$, the utility of acting on the positive result is greater than the utility of not acting, indicating that the expected benefits outweigh the expected harms under this model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.850}$$", "id": "4356938"}, {"introduction": "The ACMG/AMP framework provides standardized criteria for variant classification, but applying these rules can feel subjective.

Consider a gene associated with a late-onset condition where return-of-results policies depend on accurate estimates of penetrance. Define penetrance as the probability that a carrier develops the condition by a specified age threshold, denoted $p = P(D \\mid G)$, where $D$ is disease occurrence by the threshold and $G$ is carrier status. In a clinic-based cohort of referred carriers identified through diagnostic sequencing, among $600$ referred carriers, $240$ have documented disease by the threshold.
