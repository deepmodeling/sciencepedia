Key concepts like QALYs, willingness-to-pay thresholds, and payer-perspective economic evaluation are used correctly and are fundamental to the field of health technology assessment.

It is free of subjective claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. It provides all variables and relationships needed for the calculation ($\\Delta Q$, $\\lambda$, $C_{savings}$) and contains no contradictory information. The assumptions (e.g., expected values, costs considered) are explicitly stated.\n- **Relatedness to Topic**: The problem is directly and correctly situated within the specified topic of *reimbursement policies and economic models for genomic testing* in the field of *precision medicine and genomic diagnostics*.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective application of a standard economic model.\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Valid Problem\nThe Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) is an approach to value health outcomes and costs in a common monetary unit. It is defined as the monetized value of the health gain minus the incremental net cost.\n\nThe monetized value of the health gain is the incremental health gain, $\\Delta Q$, multiplied by the societal or payer's willingness-to-pay for that gain, $\\lambda$.\n$$ \\text{Monetized Health Gain} = \\lambda \\times \\Delta Q $$\n\nThe incremental cost from the payer's perspective is the new cost incurred minus any cost savings. The new cost is the price of the test, $P$. The cost savings are given as $C_{savings}$.\n$$ \\text{Incremental Net Cost} = P - C_{savings} $$\n\nTherefore, the NMB equation is:\n$$ NMB = (\\lambda \\times \\Delta Q) - (P - C_{savings}) $$\n\nThe problem asks for the break-even unit price, $P^{\\ast}$, at which the Net Monetary Benefit is zero. We set $NMB = 0$ and solve for $P=P^{\\ast}$.\n$$ 0 = (\\lambda \\times \\Delta Q) - (P^{\\ast} - C_{savings}) $$\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for $P^{\\ast}$:\n$$ P^{\\ast} - C_{savings} = \\lambda \\times \\Delta Q $$\n$$ P^{\\ast} = (\\lambda \\times \\Delta Q) + C_{savings} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this equation:\n- $\\lambda = 100,000$ (in USD per QALY)\n- $\\Delta Q = 0.015$ (in QALYs)\n- $C_{savings} = 1,800$ (in USD)\n\nFirst, calculate the monetized health gain:\n$$ \\lambda \\times \\Delta Q = 100,000 \\times 0.015 = 1,500 $$\nThis result is in units of USD.\n\nNext, add the cost savings to find the break-even price $P^{\\ast}$:\n$$ P^{\\ast} = 1,500 + 1,800 $$\n$$ P^{\\ast} = 3,300 $$\n\nThus, the break-even unit price for the test, from the payer's perspective, is $\\$3,300$. At this price, the cost of the test is exactly offset by the sum of the monetized health benefits and the downstream cost savings, resulting in a Net Monetary Benefit of zero.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3300}\n$$", "id": "4377291"}, {"introduction": "Reimbursement decisions are almost always made with incomplete evidence, creating uncertainty about a test's true value.

The payer uses the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) framework at a fixed willingness-to-pay threshold, where the option implemented under uncertainty is the one that maximizes expected value. The standard of care without the genomic test is the baseline with $NMB$ equal to $0$. Based on current evidence synthesis, the clinical utility of the test is uncertain and takes one of two states: effective or ineffective. If the test is effective, the incremental $NMB$ of adopting the test versus not adopting it is $3{,}000$. If the test is ineffective, the incremental $NMB$ is $-1{,}000$.

It is calculated as the difference between the expected value of a decision made with perfect information and the expected value of the optimal decision made under uncertainty.\n\nLet the two states of nature be $S_{\\text{eff}}$, where the test is effective, and $S_{\\text{ineff}}$, where the test is ineffective.\nThe prior probabilities for these states are given as:\n$P(S_{\\text{eff}}) = 0.6$\n$P(S_{\\text{ineff}}) = 0.4$\n\nThe decision-maker has two possible actions: $A_{\\text{adopt}}$, to adopt and reimburse the test, and $A_{\\neg\\text{adopt}}$, to not adopt the test (maintain the standard of care).\n\nThe problem provides the incremental Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) for adopting the test compared to not adopting it for each state of nature. The incremental NMB of not adopting the test is, by definition, $0$.

This is the action that maximizes the Expected Net Monetary Benefit (ENMB).\n\nThe ENMB for adopting the test is:\n$$ENMB(A_{\\text{adopt}}) = P(S_{\\text{eff}}) \\times NMB(A_{\\text{adopt}}, S_{\\text{eff}}) + P(S_{\\text{ineff}}) \\times NMB(A_{\\text{adopt}}, S_{\\text{ineff}})$$\n$$ENMB(A_{\\text{adopt}}) = (0.6) \\times (3000) + (0.4) \\times (-1000)$$\n$$ENMB(A_{\\text{adopt}}) = 1800 - 400 = 1400 \\text{ USD}$$\n\nThe ENMB for not adopting the test is:\n$$ENMB(A_{\\neg\\text{adopt}}) = P(S_{\\text{eff}}) \\times NMB(A_{\\neg\\text{adopt}}, S_{\\text{eff}}) + P(S_{\\text{ineff}}) \\times NMB(A_{\\neg\\text{adopt}}, S_{\\text{ineff}})$$\n$$ENMB(A_{\\neg\\text{adopt}}) = (0.6) \\times (0) + (0.4) \\times (0) = 0 \\text{ USD}$$\n\nTo find the optimal decision under uncertainty, we compare the ENMB of the two actions:\n$$ENMB_{\\text{max}} = \\max(ENMB(A_{\\text{adopt}}), ENMB(A_{\\neg\\text{adopt}})) = \\max(1400, 0) = 1400 \\text{ USD}$$\nSince $1400  0$, the optimal decision under uncertainty is to adopt the test ($A_{\\text{adopt}}$). The expected value of this optimal decision is $1400$ USD.\n\nNext, we calculate the Expected Value with Perfect Information (EVwPI). With perfect information, the decision-maker would know the true state of nature before choosing an action. They would choose the action that maximizes the NMB for that specific state.\n\nIf the true state is $S_{\\text{eff}}$, the optimal action is the one that gives the higher NMB:\n$$\\max(NMB(A_{\\text{adopt}}, S_{\\text{eff}}), NMB(A_{\\neg\\text{adopt}}, S_{\\text{eff}})) = \\max(3000, 0) = 3000 \\text{ USD}$$\nSo, if the test is known to be effective, the decision-maker would adopt it.\n\nIf the true state is $S_{\\text{ineff}}$, the optimal action is:\n$$\\max(NMB(A_{\\text{adopt}}, S_{\\text{ineff}}), NMB(A_{\\neg\\text{adopt}}, S_{\\text{ineff}})) = \\max(-1000, 0) = 0 \\text{ USD}$$\nSo, if the test is known to be ineffective, the decision-maker would not adopt it.\n\nThe EVwPI is the expected value of these state-contingent optimal decisions, weighted by the prior probabilities of the states occurring:\n$$EVwPI = P(S_{\\text{eff}}) \\times \\max(3000, 0) + P(S_{\\text{ineff}}) \\times \\max(-1000, 0)$$\n$$EVwPI = (0.6) \\times (3000) + (0.4) \\times (0)$$\n$$EVwPI = 1800 + 0 = 1800 \\text{ USD}$$\n\nFinally, the EVPI is the difference between the Expected Value with Perfect Information and the maximum Expected Net Monetary Benefit under uncertainty:\n$$EVPI = EVwPI - ENMB_{\\text{max}}$$\n$$EVPI = 1800 - 1400 = 400 \\text{ USD}$$\n\nThe EVPI represents the expected gain from avoiding the consequences of making a suboptimal choice. The suboptimal choice occurs when adopting the test ($A_{\\text{adopt}}$) if the state is actually $S_{\\text{ineff}}$. The loss from this error, or \"opportunity loss,\" is the value of the best action in that state minus the value of the chosen action: $0 - (-1000) = 1000$. This error occurs with probability $P(S_{\\text{ineff}}) = 0.4$.

Derivation of the Mean of NMB ($\\mu_{NMB}$)**\n\nThe expectation operator is linear.

The covariance can be expressed in terms of the correlation coefficient $\\rho$: $\\text{Cov}(\\Delta Q, \\Delta C) = \\rho \\sigma_Q \\sigma_C$.

By the symmetry of the normal distribution, $\\mathbb{P}(Z  -z) = \\mathbb{P}(Z  z)$. Therefore:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(NMB  0) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z  \\frac{\\mu_{NMB}}{\\sigma_{NMB}}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{NMB}}{\\sigma_{NMB}}\\right) $$\nThis expression provides the exact probability assuming a non-degenerate distribution for $NMB$.\n\n**4. Handling the Degenerate Case ($\\sigma^2_{NMB} = 0$)**\n\nA degenerate case occurs if $\\sigma^2_{NMB} = 0$.
