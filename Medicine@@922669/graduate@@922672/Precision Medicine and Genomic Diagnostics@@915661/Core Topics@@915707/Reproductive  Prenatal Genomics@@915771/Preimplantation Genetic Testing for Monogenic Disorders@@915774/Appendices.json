Assume the following fundamental biological principles and conditions hold: Mendel’s law of segregation applies so that each heterozygous parent produces gametes carrying $A$ and $a$ with equal probability; inheritance is sex-independent because the locus is autosomal; the allele transmissions from the two parents are independent; and there are no de novo mutations, gene conversions, or gametic selection.\n\nUnder these assumptions, derive from first principles the probability that a randomly formed embryo (prior to any biopsy, amplification, or selection steps) is affected ($aa$), a carrier ($Aa$), or unaffected and non-carrier ($AA$).

It presents a classic scenario in Mendelian genetics, which is the foundation for understanding inheritance patterns, including those relevant to Preimplantation Genetic Testing for Monogenic disorders (PGT-M). The givens are complete and consistent, and the assumptions are standard simplifications used in such problems. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be derived from first principles.\n\nThe problem concerns an autosomal recessive disorder. The normal allele is denoted by $A$ and the pathogenic allele by $a$. Both parents are heterozygous carriers, meaning their genotype is $Aa$. The disorder manifests only in individuals with the homozygous recessive genotype, $aa$. We are tasked with determining the probabilities of an embryo having one of the three possible genotypes: $AA$ (unaffected, non-carrier), $Aa$ (unaffected, carrier), or $aa$ (affected).\n\nThe derivation is based on the following principles provided in the problem statement:\n$1$. Mendel's Law of Segregation: A heterozygous individual with genotype $Aa$ produces two types of gametes, one carrying the $A$ allele and one carrying the $a$ allele, with equal probability.\n$2$. Independence of Allele Transmission: The allele contributed by one parent is independent of the allele contributed by the other parent.\n\nLet us determine the gamete probabilities for each parent. Since both parents have the genotype $Aa$, each parent produces gametes with allele $A$ and allele $a$. According to the Law of Segregation, the probabilities are:\n- Probability of a gamete from a parent carrying allele $A$: $P(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Probability of a gamete from a parent carrying allele $a$: $P(a) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nAn embryo's genotype is formed by the fusion of one gamete from each parent. Due to the independence of allele transmission, the probability of a specific offspring genotype is the product of the probabilities of the constituent gametes. We can analyze the three possible genotypes for the embryo:\n\n$1$. **Unaffected and non-carrier (genotype $AA$)**:\nThis genotype results from the fusion of a gamete carrying $A$ from the father and a gamete carrying $A$ from the mother. The probability is:\n$$P(AA) = P(\\text{sperm}=A) \\times P(\\text{ovum}=A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\n$2$. **Affected (genotype $aa$)**:\nThis genotype results from the fusion of a gamete carrying $a$ from the father and a gamete carrying $a$ from the mother. The probability is:\n$$P(aa) = P(\\text{sperm}=a) \\times P(\\text{ovum}=a) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\n$3$. **Unaffected carrier (genotype $Aa$)**:\nThis heterozygous genotype can be formed in two mutually exclusive ways:\na) An $A$ allele from the father and an $a$ allele from the mother. The probability of this event is $P(\\text{sperm}=A) \\times P(\\text{ovum}=a) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nb) An $a$ allele from the father and an $A$ allele from the mother. The probability of this event is $P(\\text{sperm}=a) \\times P(\\text{ovum}=A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe total probability of the $Aa$ genotype is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n$$P(Aa) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThis can be systematically visualized using a Punnett square, where each cell represents an equally likely outcome with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n & \\mathbf{A} \\text{ (father)} & \\mathbf{a} \\text{ (father)} \\\\\n \\hline\n\\mathbf{A} \\text{ (mother)} & AA & Aa \\\\\n\\mathbf{a} \\text{ (mother)} & aA & aa\n\\end{array}\n$$\nSince the order of alleles does not matter ($aA$ is the same as $Aa$), the genotype probabilities are: $P(AA) = \\frac{1}{4}$, $P(Aa) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$, and $P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe sum of these probabilities is $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$, as expected.\n\nWe can now map these genotypic probabilities to the statuses requested:\n- Probability of being affected, $p_{\\text{affected}}$, corresponds to the genotype $aa$.\n$$p_{\\text{affected}} = P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n- Probability of being a carrier, $p_{\\text{carrier}}$, corresponds to the genotype $Aa$.\n$$p_{\\text{carrier}} = P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n- Probability of being unaffected and non-carrier, $p_{\\text{unaffected}}$, corresponds to the genotype $AA$.\n$$p_{\\text{unaffected}} = P(AA) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer as a single row matrix in the order $\\left(p_{\\text{affected}},\\,p_{\\text{carrier}},\\,p_{\\text{unaffected}}\\right)$.\nSubstituting the calculated values, we get:\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}\\right)$$\nThese are the well-established Mendelian ratios for a monohybrid cross between two heterozygous parents.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{4} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4372430"}, {"introduction": "The diagnostic accuracy of PGT-M hinges on reliably genotyping a few embryonic cells, a process fraught with technical challenges.
