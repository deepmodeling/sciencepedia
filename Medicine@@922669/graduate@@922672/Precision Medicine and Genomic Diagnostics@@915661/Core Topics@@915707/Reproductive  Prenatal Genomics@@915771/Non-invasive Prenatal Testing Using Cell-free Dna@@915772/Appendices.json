Consider a sample with a total of $30{,}000{,}000$ uniquely mapped autosomal reads, of which $1{,}050{,}000$ map to chromosome $21$. The euploid reference cohort yields a mean fraction for chromosome $21$ of $0.015$ and a between-sample standard deviation of $0.0005$ for the same normalization and counting scheme.\n\nStarting from the fundamental statistical notion of standardization—viewing the observed fraction as a realization from a distribution characterized by a reference mean and standard deviation under the null hypothesis of euploidy—and assuming that, due to the large number of reads, the standardized deviate is approximately standard normal, compute the standardized deviate (z-score) for chromosome $21$ in this sample.\n\nThen, interpret whether the result is consistent with overrepresentation of chromosome $21$ that would be used to flag a potential trisomy $21$ call in a research setting that uses a two-sided normal cutoff of $|z| \\ge 3$.\n\nReport only the z-score as a pure number, rounded to three significant figures, in your final numeric answer.

This score is used to assess whether the observed fraction is statistically deviant from a reference population of euploid samples, which would suggest a chromosomal aneuploidy like trisomy $21$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the observed fraction of reads for chromosome $21$ in the given sample. Let $N_{total}$ be the total number of uniquely mapped autosomal reads and $N_{21}$ be the number of those reads that map to chromosome $21$.\n\nThe given values are:\nTotal autosomal reads, $N_{total} = 30{,}000{,}000$.\nChromosome $21$ reads, $N_{21} = 1{,}050{,}000$.\n\nThe observed fraction of reads for chromosome $21$, denoted as $f_{obs}$, is the ratio of $N_{21}$ to $N_{total}$:\n$$f_{obs} = \\frac{N_{21}}{N_{total}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$f_{obs} = \\frac{1{,}050{,}000}{30{,}000{,}000} = \\frac{1.05}{30} = 0.035$$\n\nNext, we calculate the z-score. The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an observation is from the mean of a reference distribution. The problem specifies that the reference distribution is derived from a euploid cohort and provides its mean and standard deviation.\n\nLet $\\mu_{ref}$ be the mean fraction for chromosome $21$ in the reference euploid cohort, and let $\\sigma_{ref}$ be the between-sample standard deviation for this fraction. The problem provides:\nMean reference fraction, $\\mu_{ref} = 0.015$.\nStandard deviation of the reference fraction, $\\sigma_{ref} = 0.0005$.\n\nThe formula for the z-score is:\n$$z = \\frac{f_{obs} - \\mu_{ref}}{\\sigma_{ref}}$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated $f_{obs}$ and the given reference parameters:\n$$z = \\frac{0.035 - 0.015}{0.0005}$$\n$$z = \\frac{0.020}{0.0005}$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can express the numerator and denominator in scientific notation or as a ratio of integers:\n$$z = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 10^{-2 - (-4)} = 0.4 \\times 10^{2} = 40$$\n\nThe calculated z-score for chromosome $21$ in this sample is exactly $40$.\n\nThe problem also asks for an interpretation of this result in a research context where a potential trisomy $21$ is flagged if the absolute value of the z-score, $|z|$, is greater than or equal to $3$.\nIn our case, $|z| = |40| = 40$.\nSince $40 \\ge 3$, the observed fraction of chromosome $21$ reads is $40$ standard deviations above the mean of the euploid reference population. This is a very strong statistical signal indicating a significant overrepresentation of chromosome $21$. Such a result is highly consistent with the presence of an extra copy of chromosome $21$ in the fetal genome, and would be flagged as high-risk for trisomy $21$.\n\nThe final answer requires the z-score as a pure number rounded to three significant figures.

The actual probability that a positive screening result corresponds to a truly affected fetus is given by the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), a metric that depends not only on the test's sensitivity and specificity but also critically on the condition's prevalence in the population.

The PPV is the posterior probability that a fetus has the condition given a positive test result. This will be accomplished using Bayes' theorem and the provided epidemiological and test performance data.\n\nFirst, let us define the relevant events:\n- $D$: The event that a fetus has Trisomy $21$. This corresponds to the disease being present.\n- $D^c$: The event that a fetus does not have Trisomy $21$.\n- $T^+$: The event that the NIPT result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the NIPT result is negative.\n\nNext, we formalize the givens of the problem in terms of probabilities:\n1.  The prevalence of Trisomy $21$ is given as $1/700$. This is the prior probability of the condition, $P(D)$.\n    $$P(D) = \\frac{1}{700}$$\n    From this, the probability of not having the condition is:\n    $$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\frac{1}{700} = \\frac{699}{700}$$\n\n2.  The sensitivity of the test is $99\\%$. Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the condition is present. This is the true positive rate, $P(T^+ \\mid D)$.\n    $$P(T^+ \\mid D) = 99\\% = 0.99$$\n\n3.  The specificity of the test is $99.9\\%$. Specificity is the probability of a negative test result given that the condition is not present. This is the true negative rate, $P(T^- \\mid D^c)$.\n    $$P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 99.9\\% = 0.999$$\n\nThe quantity we need to calculate is the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is defined as $P(D \\mid T^+)$, the probability of having the disease given a positive test.\n\nWe begin with Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, summing over the two possible states (disease present or disease absent):\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A \\mid B)P(B)$, we can write:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(T^+ \\mid D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nThe term $P(T^+ \\mid D^c)$ is the false positive rate. It is the probability of a positive test result when the condition is absent. This can be derived from the specificity:\n$$P(T^+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 1 - 0.999 = 0.001$$\n\nNow we substitute the expression for $P(T^+)$ back into Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(T^+ \\mid D^c) P(D^c)}$$\n\nWe have all the necessary values to compute the PPV. Let's substitute them into the formula:\n- $P(D) = \\frac{1}{700}$\n- $P(D^c) = \\frac{699}{700}$\n- $P(T^+ \\mid D) = 0.99$\n- $P(T^+ \\mid D^c) = 0.001$\n\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{(0.99) \\left(\\frac{1}{700}\\right)}{(0.99) \\left(\\frac{1}{700}\\right) + (0.001) \\left(\\frac{699}{700}\\right)}$$\n\nWe can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $700$ to simplify the expression:\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{0.99}{0.99 + (0.001)(699)}$$\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{0.99}{0.99 + 0.699}$$\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{0.99}{1.689}$$\n\nNow, we perform the final division:\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) \\approx 0.586145648...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) \\approx 0.5861$$\n\nThe calculated Positive Predictive Value is approximately $0.5861$, or $58.61\\%$. This result has profound clinical implications. Despite the test having very high sensitivity ($99\\%$) and specificity ($99.9\\%$), a positive result only indicates a $58.61\\%$ chance that the fetus actually has Trisomy $21$. The remaining $41.39\\%$ chance represents a false positive. The relatively low prevalence of the condition in the population significantly influences the PPV. This calculation underscores the critical distinction between a screening test (like NIPT) and a diagnostic test. For patient counseling, it is imperative to explain that a positive NIPT result is not a diagnosis. It signals an increased risk and necessitates a recommendation for confirmatory diagnostic testing, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS), which carry a small risk of pregnancy loss but provide a definitive diagnosis.
