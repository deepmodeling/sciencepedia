The model described is a standard and fundamental approach used in bioinformatics and computational biology for NIPT data analysis.

The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information and data provided to derive the estimator and calculate a specific value. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. It is a formalizable, relevant, complete, and non-trivial problem in quantitative biology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a coverage-weighted estimator for the fetal fraction, $f$, and its application to a given dataset.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical model. For the specified paternal-informative SNP loci, the mother is homozygous for the reference allele (e.g., genotype AA) and the fetus is heterozygous (e.g., genotype Aa). Maternal plasma cfDNA is a mixture of maternal DNA (proportion $1-f$) and fetal DNA (proportion $f$). The minor allele, 'a', is present only in the fetal component of the cfDNA. Within the fetal DNA component, since the fetus is heterozygous, the proportion of the minor allele is exactly $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nLet $p$ be the expected proportion of minor allele reads in the total cfDNA pool at an informative locus. This proportion is the sum of contributions from the maternal and fetal fractions:\n$$ p = (1-f) \\times (\\text{proportion of minor allele in maternal DNA}) + f \\times (\\text{proportion of minor allele in fetal DNA}) $$\nGiven the maternal genotype is homozygous for the reference allele, her contribution of the minor allele is $0$. The fetal contribution is $f \\times \\frac{1}{2}$.\n$$ p = (1-f) \\times 0 + f \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{f}{2} $$\nThis gives a direct relationship between the fetal fraction $f$ and the expected minor allele proportion $p$. From this, we can write $f = 2p$.\n\nAt each locus $i$, we observe $m_i$ reads for the minor allele out of a total of $c_i$ sequencing reads. Under the assumption of independent and unbiased read sampling, the count $m_i$ can be modeled as a random draw from a binomial distribution:\n$$ m_i \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n=c_i, p) $$\nwhere $p = f/2$.\n\nAn unbiased estimator for the proportion $p$ at a single locus $i$ is the observed frequency, $\\hat{p}_i = \\frac{m_i}{c_i}$. Consequently, an estimator for $f$ from locus $i$ is:\n$$ \\hat{f}_i = 2\\hat{p}_i = 2 \\frac{m_i}{c_i} $$\n\nWe have $M$ such independent loci, giving $M$ independent estimates $\\hat{f}_1, \\hat{f}_2, \\ldots, \\hat{f}_M$. To obtain a single, more precise estimate, we can compute a weighted average:\n$$ \\hat{f} = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} w_i \\hat{f}_i $$\nwhere the weights $w_i$ are positive and sum to unity ($\\sum_{i=1}^{M} w_i = 1$) to ensure the combined estimator $\\hat{f}$ is unbiased, since each $\\hat{f}_i$ is an unbiased estimator of $f$.\n\nThe problem asks to justify the weights using a variance argument. The optimal weights that produce the minimum variance for the combined estimator are inversely proportional to the variance of each individual estimator. This is a standard result from statistical estimation theory.\n$$ w_i \\propto \\frac{1}{\\text{Var}(\\hat{f}_i)} $$\nLet us compute the variance of $\\hat{f}_i$:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{f}_i) = \\text{Var}\\left(2 \\frac{m_i}{c_i}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{c_i}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(m_i) = \\frac{4}{c_i^2} \\text{Var}(m_i) $$\nFor a binomial random variable $m_i \\sim \\text{Binomial}(c_i, p)$, the variance is $\\text{Var}(m_i) = c_i p (1-p)$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\text{Var}(\\hat{f}_i)$:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{f}_i) = \\frac{4}{c_i^2} [c_i p (1-p)] = \\frac{4p(1-p)}{c_i} $$\nSince the weights $w_i$ are inversely proportional to this variance, we have:\n$$ w_i \\propto \\frac{1}{ \\frac{4p(1-p)}{c_i} } = \\frac{c_i}{4p(1-p)} $$\nThe term $4p(1-p)$ is a constant for all loci (as $p=f/2$ is assumed to be constant). Therefore, the weights are directly proportional to the sequencing coverage at each locus:\n$$ w_i \\propto c_i $$\nThis provides the justification for a \"coverage-weighted\" estimator. To ensure the weights sum to $1$, we normalize them:\n$$ w_i = \\frac{c_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{M} c_j} $$\nNow we substitute these weights and the single-locus estimators $\\hat{f}_i$ back into the formula for the combined estimator $\\hat{f}$:\n$$ \\hat{f} = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} w_i \\hat{f}_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\left( \\frac{c_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{M} c_j} \\right) \\left( 2 \\frac{m_i}{c_i} \\right) $$\nThe $c_i$ terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out:\n$$ \\hat{f} = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\frac{2 m_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{M} c_j} = \\frac{2 \\sum_{i=1}^{M} m_i}{\\sum_{j=1}^{M} c_j} $$\nThis is the final derived coverage-weighted estimator. It is equivalent to pooling all reads across all informative loci and calculating the fetal fraction from the total minor allele counts and total coverages.\n\nNow, we evaluate this estimator on the provided dataset with $M=5$ loci.\nFirst, we compute the sum of all minor-allele read counts, $\\sum m_i$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{5} m_i = m_1 + m_2 + m_3 + m_4 + m_5 = 64 + 49 + 42 + 77 + 56 = 288 $$\nNext, we compute the sum of all total read coverages, $\\sum c_i$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{5} c_i = c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + c_4 + c_5 = 1023 + 850 + 765 + 1200 + 950 = 4788 $$\nFinally, we substitute these sums into the estimator formula for $\\hat{f}$:\n$$ \\hat{f} = \\frac{2 \\times 288}{4788} = \\frac{576}{4788} $$\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$$ \\hat{f} \\approx 0.1202999164578... $$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $2$, $0$, and $2$.

Thus, the parameters $V_0$ and $\\eta$ are not required for the calculation of $f$.\nAfter cancellation, the expression for $f(\\mathrm{BMI})$ simplifies to:\n$$\nf(\\mathrm{BMI}) = \\frac{\\frac{R_{\\text{placenta}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{placenta}}}}{\\frac{R_{\\text{placenta}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{placenta}}} + \\frac{R_{\\text{maternal}}(\\mathrm{BMI})}{\\lambda_{\\text{maternal}}}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given expression for the maternal production rate, $R_{\\text{maternal}}(\\mathrm{BMI}) = R_{\\text{maternal},0}\\left(1 + \\alpha\\left(\\mathrm{BMI} - \\mathrm{BMI}_{0}\\right)\\right)$:\n$$\nf(\\mathrm{BMI}) = \\frac{\\frac{R_{\\text{placenta}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{placenta}}}}{\\frac{R_{\\text{placenta}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{placenta}}} + \\frac{R_{\\text{maternal},0}\\left(1 + \\alpha\\left(\\mathrm{BMI} - \\mathrm{BMI}_{0}\\right)\\right)}{\\lambda_{\\text{maternal}}}}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $f(\\mathrm{BMI})$. To simplify the appearance of this fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $\\lambda_{\\text{placenta}} \\lambda_{\\text{maternal}}$:\n$$\nf(\\mathrm{BMI}) = \\frac{R_{\\text{placenta}}\\lambda_{\\text{maternal}}}{R_{\\text{placenta}}\\lambda_{\\text{maternal}} + R_{\\text{maternal},0}\\lambda_{\\text{placenta}}\\left(1 + \\alpha\\left(\\mathrm{BMI} - \\mathrm{BMI}_{0}\\right)\\right)}\n$$\nNext, we must evaluate this expression for $\\mathrm{BMI} = 35$ using the provided parameters:\n$R_{\\text{placenta}} = 10\\,\\text{ng}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$\n$R_{\\text{maternal},0} = 90\\,\\text{ng}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$\n$\\alpha = 0.03\\,(\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-2})^{-1}$\n$\\mathrm{BMI}_{0} = 22\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}$\n$\\lambda_{\\text{placenta}} = 1\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$\n$\\lambda_{\\text{maternal}} = 1\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$\n\nA specific simplification occurs because $\\lambda_{\\text{placenta}} = \\lambda_{\\text{maternal}} = 1\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$. In this case, the clearance rate constants cancel out from the expression for $f(\\mathrm{BMI})$:\n$$\nf(\\mathrm{BMI}) = \\frac{R_{\\text{placenta}}}{R_{\\text{placenta}} + R_{\\text{maternal},0}\\left(1 + \\alpha\\left(\\mathrm{BMI} - \\mathrm{BMI}_{0}\\right)\\right)}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the term dependent on $\\mathrm{BMI}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{BMI} - \\mathrm{BMI}_{0} = 35\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-2} - 22\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-2} = 13\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\n$$\nNow, compute the factor by which the baseline maternal production rate increases:\n$$\n1 + \\alpha\\left(\\mathrm{BMI} - \\mathrm{BMI}_{0}\\right) = 1 + (0.03 \\times 13) = 1 + 0.39 = 1.39\n$$\nThis factor is dimensionless, as the units of $\\alpha$ and $(\\mathrm{BMI} - \\mathrm{BMI}_{0})$ cancel.\nThe maternal production rate at $\\mathrm{BMI} = 35$ is:\n$$\nR_{\\text{maternal}}(35) = R_{\\text{maternal},0} \\times 1.39 = 90\\,\\text{ng}\\,\\text{h}^{-1} \\times 1.39 = 125.1\\,\\text{ng}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}\n$$\nFinally, we can calculate the fetal fraction:\n$$\nf(35) = \\frac{R_{\\text{placenta}}}{R_{\\text{placenta}} + R_{\\text{maternal}}(35)} = \\frac{10}{10 + 125.1} = \\frac{10}{135.1}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nf(35) \\approx 0.074019245\n$$\nRounding the result to 4 significant figures as requested gives $0.07402$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.07402}$$", "id": "4339618"}]}
