A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation\nLet $D$ be the event that a newborn has the disease, and $D^c$ be the event that the newborn does not have the disease. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe core parameters are defined as probabilities:\n-   Prevalence: $p = P(D)$, so $P(D^c) = 1 - p$.\n-   Sensitivity: $Se = P(T^+|D)$.\n-   Specificity: $Sp = P(T^-|D^c)$. From this, the false positive rate is $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - Sp$.\n-   Positive Predictive Value: $PPV = P(D|T^+)$.\n\nThe problem requires starting from Bayes' theorem to define the PPV:\n$$PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test. It can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence into this expansion gives:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se \\cdot p) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - p))$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $P(T^+)$ back into the formula for PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{(Se \\cdot p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}$$\nThe policy constraint is that the PPV must be at least $0.1$. We can write this as an inequality:\n$$PPV \\ge 0.1$$\nSubstituting the full expression for PPV, we have:\n$$\\frac{Se \\cdot p}{(Se \\cdot p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)} \\ge 0.1$$\nWe must now solve this inequality for the specificity, $Sp$. Since all terms in the denominator represent probabilities or products of probabilities, the denominator is non-negative. For a non-zero prevalence, it is strictly positive, so we can multiply both sides by the denominator without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$Se \\cdot p \\ge 0.1 \\left[ (Se \\cdot p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p) \\right]$$\nDistributing the $0.1$ on the right side:\n$$Se \\cdot p \\ge 0.1 \\cdot Se \\cdot p + 0.1(1 - Sp)(1 - p)$$\nTo isolate the term containing $Sp$, we first move the other terms to the left side:\n$$Se \\cdot p - 0.1 \\cdot Se \\cdot p \\ge 0.1(1 - Sp)(1 - p)$$\n$$Se \\cdot p (1 - 0.1) \\ge 0.1(1 - p) - 0.1 \\cdot Sp (1 - p)$$\nMove the term with $Sp$ to the left side:\n$$Se \\cdot p (0.9) + 0.1 \\cdot Sp (1 - p) \\ge 0.1(1 - p)$$\nIsolate the $Sp$ term:\n$$0.1 \\cdot Sp (1 - p) \\ge 0.1(1 - p) - 0.9 \\cdot Se \\cdot p$$\nSince $p \\in [10^{-6}, 10^{-3}]$, the term $(1 - p)$ is positive, and $0.1$ is positive. We can divide by $0.1(1 - p)$:\n$$Sp \\ge \\frac{0.1(1 - p) - 0.9 \\cdot Se \\cdot p}{0.1(1 - p)}$$\n$$Sp \\ge 1 - \\frac{0.9 \\cdot Se \\cdot p}{0.1(1 - p)}$$\nThis is the general condition on $Sp$. The minimal required specificity, which we denote as $Sp_{min}(p)$, is the value that makes this an equality:\n$$Sp_{min}(p) = 1 - \\frac{0.9 \\cdot Se \\cdot p}{0.1(1 - p)}$$\nThe problem provides the value for sensitivity, $Se = 0.95$. Substituting this value into the expression:\n$$Sp_{min}(p) = 1 - \\frac{0.9 \\cdot (0.95) \\cdot p}{0.1(1 - p)}$$\n$$Sp_{min}(p) = 1 - \\frac{0.855p}{0.1(1 - p)}$$\n$$Sp_{min}(p) = 1 - \\frac{8.55p}{1 - p}$$\nTo obtain a single fractional expression, we find a common denominator:\n$$Sp_{min}(p) = \\frac{1 - p}{1 - p} - \\frac{8.55p}{1 - p} = \\frac{(1 - p) - 8.55p}{1 - p}$$\n$$Sp_{min}(p) = \\frac{1 - 9.55p}{1 - p}$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the minimal required specificity as a function of the disease prevalence $p$.

The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All definitions and conditions are standard in the fields of epidemiology and medical genetics, and the provided data are self-contained and consistent.\n\nThe primary quantity to be derived is the Positive Predictive Value, $PPV = P(D \\mid T^{+})$, which is the probability that a child will manifest the disorder ($D$) given a positive assay result ($T^{+}$).\n\nFrom the definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^{+})}{P(T^{+})}$$\n\nTo find the numerator and denominator, we will use the law of total probability, conditioning on the presence ($V$) or absence ($\\neg V$) of the pathogenic genotype.\n\nFirst, let us establish the relationship between the disease prevalence, $p$, and the genotype prevalence, $P(V)$. The problem states $p = P(D)$. Using the law of total probability for $P(D)$:\n$$p = P(D) = P(D \\mid V)P(V) + P(D \\mid \\neg V)P(\\neg V)$$\nWe are given the penetrance $\\pi = P(D \\mid V)$ and the condition that the disorder is exclusively caused by the screened genotype, $P(D \\mid \\neg V) = 0$. Substituting these into the equation gives:\n$$p = \\pi \\cdot P(V) + 0 \\cdot P(\\neg V) = \\pi \\cdot P(V)$$\nFrom this, we can express the prevalence of the pathogenic genotype in terms of the disease prevalence and penetrance, provided $\\pi \\ne 0$:\n$$P(V) = \\frac{p}{\\pi}$$\nConsequently, the probability of not having the genotype is $P(\\neg V) = 1 - P(V) = 1 - \\frac{p}{\\pi}$.\n\nNow, we will derive the numerator of the PPV expression, $P(D \\cap T^{+})$. Using the law of total probability:\n$$P(D \\cap T^{+}) = P(D \\cap T^{+} \\mid V)P(V) + P(D \\cap T^{+} \\mid \\neg V)P(\\neg V)$$\nThe second term, $P(D \\cap T^{+} \\mid \\neg V)$, is the probability of having the disease and a positive test, given the absence of the causative genotype. Since $P(D \\mid \\neg V) = 0$, it is impossible to have the disease without the genotype, so $P(D \\cap T^{+} \\mid \\neg V) = 0$.\nThe expression for the numerator simplifies to:\n$$P(D \\cap T^{+}) = P(D \\cap T^{+} \\mid V)P(V)$$\nThe term $P(D \\cap T^{+} \\mid V)$ represents the probability of both disease manifestation and a positive test, given the genotype is present. The performance of the genomic assay ($T^{+}$) in detecting the genotype ($V$) is independent of the downstream biological process of disease manifestation ($D$), conditional on the genotype being present. Therefore, we can state conditional independence: $P(D \\cap T^{+} \\mid V) = P(D \\mid V) P(T^{+} \\mid V)$.\nUsing the given definitions for penetrance ($\\pi = P(D \\mid V)$) and sensitivity ($Se = P(T^{+} \\mid V)$), we have:\n$$P(D \\cap T^{+} \\mid V) = \\pi \\cdot Se$$\nSubstituting this back, the numerator becomes:\n$$P(D \\cap T^{+}) = (\\pi \\cdot Se) \\cdot P(V) = (\\pi \\cdot Se) \\cdot \\frac{p}{\\pi} = Se \\cdot p$$\n\nNext, we derive the denominator, $P(T^{+})$.

This implies that detection for this individual still occurs at time $T_c$, so there is no gain over the no-screening baseline.\n\nCombining these terms, the general formula for the expected incremental net benefit per newborn for a screening test is:\n$E_{\\text{inc}} = (s \\cdot p) \\cdot B(\\exp(-\\lambda T) - \\exp(-\\lambda T_c)) - (1-c)(1-p) \\cdot U_{\\text{fp}}$.\n\nNow, we apply this formula to each screening modality using the provided parameters:\n$p = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}$, $B = 0.8$, $\\lambda = 0.05$, $T_c = 30$, $U_{\\text{fp}} = 0.002$.\n\n**Biochemical Screening:**\nParameters: $s_b = 0.94$, $c_b = 0.995$, $T_b = 2$.\nThe expected incremental net benefit, $E_{\\text{inc, b}}$, is:\n$E_{\\text{inc, b}} = (s_b p) B(\\exp(-\\lambda T_b) - \\exp(-\\lambda T_c)) - (1-c_b)(1-p) U_{\\text{fp}}$\n$E_{\\text{inc, b}} = (0.94 \\cdot 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot 0.8 \\cdot (\\exp(-0.05 \\cdot 2) - \\exp(-0.05 \\cdot 30)) - (1-0.995)(1 - 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot 0.002$\n$E_{\\text{inc, b}} = (1.88 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot 0.8 \\cdot (\\exp(-0.1) - \\exp(-1.5)) - (0.005)(0.9998) \\cdot 0.002$\n$E_{\\text{inc, b}} = (1.504 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot (\\exp(-0.1) - \\exp(-1.5)) - 9.998 \\times 10^{-6}$\nUsing numerical values for the exponential terms:\n$\\exp(-0.1) \\approx 0.90483742$\n$\\exp(-1.5) \\approx 0.22313016$\n$E_{\\text{inc, b}} \\approx (1.504 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot (0.90483742 - 0.22313016) - 9.998 \\times 10^{-6}$\n$E_{\\text{inc, b}} \\approx (1.504 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot (0.68170726) - 9.998 \\times 10^{-6}$\n$E_{\\text{inc, b}} \\approx 1.0252887 \\times 10^{-4} - 9.998 \\times 10^{-6} = 1.0252887 \\times 10^{-4} - 0.09998 \\times 10^{-4}$\n$E_{\\text{inc, b}} \\approx 9.253087 \\times 10^{-5}$ QALYs per newborn.\n\n**Genomic Screening:**\nParameters: $s_g = 0.98$, $c_g = 0.999$, $T_g = 7$.\nThe expected incremental net benefit, $E_{\\text{inc, g}}$, is:\n$E_{\\text{inc, g}} = (s_g p) B(\\exp(-\\lambda T_g) - \\exp(-\\lambda T_c)) - (1-c_g)(1-p) U_{\\text{fp}}$\n$E_{\\text{inc, g}} = (0.98 \\cdot 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot 0.8 \\cdot (\\exp(-0.05 \\cdot 7) - \\exp(-0.05 \\cdot 30)) - (1-0.999)(1 - 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot 0.002$\n$E_{\\text{inc, g}} = (1.96 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot 0.8 \\cdot (\\exp(-0.35) - \\exp(-1.5)) - (0.001)(0.9998) \\cdot 0.002$\n$E_{\\text{inc, g}} = (1.568 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot (\\exp(-0.35) - \\exp(-1.5)) - 1.9996 \\times 10^{-6}$\nUsing the numerical value for the exponential term:\n$\\exp(-0.35) \\approx 0.70468809$\n$E_{\\text{inc, g}} \\approx (1.568 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot (0.70468809 - 0.22313016) - 1.9996 \\times 10^{-6}$\n$E_{\\text{inc, g}} \\approx (1.568 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot (0.48155793) - 1.9996 \\times 10^{-6}$\n$E_{\\text{inc, g}} \\approx 7.551028 \\times 10^{-5} - 1.9996 \\times 10^{-6} = 7.551028 \\times 10^{-5} - 0.19996 \\times 10^{-5}$\n$E_{\\text{inc, g}} \\approx 7.351068 \\times 10^{-5}$ QALYs per newborn.\n\n**Difference in Net Benefit:**\nThe problem asks for the difference $\\Delta$, defined as the net benefit of biochemical screening minus the net benefit of genomic screening.\n$\\Delta = E_{\\text{inc, b}} - E_{\\text{inc, g}}$\n$\\Delta \\approx (9.253087 \\times 10^{-5}) - (7.351068 \\times 10^{-5})$\n$\\Delta \\approx 1.902019 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$\\Delta \\approx 1.902 \\times 10^{-5}$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.902 \\times 10^{-5}}$$", "id": "4363940"}]}
