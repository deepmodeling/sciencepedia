We begin from the fundamental definitions provided.\n\nThe cumulative hazard function, $\\Lambda(t)$, is the integral of the hazard function $\\lambda(t)$ over time from $0$ to $t$:\n$$\n\\Lambda(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda(u)\\,du\n$$\nThe survival function, $S(t)$, is related to the cumulative hazard by:\n$$\nS(t) = \\exp(-\\Lambda(t))\n$$\nThe cumulative incidence or risk function, $F(t)$, is the complement of the survival function:\n$$\nF(t) = 1 - S(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\Lambda(t))\n$$\nWe can express the cumulative hazard in terms of the survival function:\n$$\n-\\Lambda(t) = \\ln(S(t)) \\implies \\Lambda(t) = -\\ln(S(t))\n$$\n\nThese relationships hold for both the general (baseline) population and the carrier population. For the baseline population, we have:\n- Hazard: $\\lambda_{0}(t)$\n- Cumulative hazard: $\\Lambda_{0}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda_{0}(u)\\,du$\n- Survival: $S_{0}(t) = \\exp(-\\Lambda_{0}(t))$\n- Cumulative risk: $F_{0}(t) = 1 - S_{0}(t)$\n\nFor the carrier population, we have:\n- Hazard: $\\lambda_{\\text{carrier}}(t)$\n- Cumulative hazard: $\\Lambda_{\\text{carrier}}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda_{\\text{carrier}}(u)\\,du$\n- Survival: $S_{\\text{carrier}}(t) = \\exp(-\\Lambda_{\\text{carrier}}(t))$\n- Cumulative risk: $F_{\\text{carrier}}(t) = 1 - S_{\\text{carrier}}(t)$\n\nThe crucial link between the two populations is the proportional hazards assumption: $\\lambda_{\\text{carrier}}(t) = RR \\times \\lambda_{0}(t)$. We can use this to relate their cumulative hazards:\n$$\n\\Lambda_{\\text{carrier}}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda_{\\text{carrier}}(u)\\,du = \\int_{0}^{t} (RR \\times \\lambda_{0}(u))\\,du\n$$\nSince $RR$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\n\\Lambda_{\\text{carrier}}(t) = RR \\times \\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda_{0}(u)\\,du = RR \\times \\Lambda_{0}(t)\n$$\nNow we can relate the survival functions of the two populations. We start with the definition for carrier survival and substitute the relationship for cumulative hazards:\n$$\nS_{\\text{carrier}}(t) = \\exp(-\\Lambda_{\\text{carrier}}(t)) = \\exp(-RR \\times \\Lambda_{0}(t))\n$$\nWe know that $\\Lambda_{0}(t) = -\\ln(S_{0}(t))$. Substituting this into the equation for $S_{\\text{carrier}}(t)$:\n$$\nS_{\\text{carrier}}(t) = \\exp(-RR \\times [-\\ln(S_{0}(t))]) = \\exp(RR \\times \\ln(S_{0}(t)))\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\exp(a \\ln b) = b^a$, we obtain the relationship between the two survival functions:\n$$\nS_{\\text{carrier}}(t) = [S_{0}(t)]^{RR}\n$$\nOur goal is to find the carrier's cumulative risk, $F_{\\text{carrier}}(t)$, in terms of the baseline risk, $F_{0}(t)$. We use the definitions $F(t)=1-S(t)$, which implies $S(t) = 1 - F(t)$.\n$$\n1 - F_{\\text{carrier}}(t) = [1 - F_{0}(t)]^{RR}\n$$\nSolving for $F_{\\text{carrier}}(t)$ gives the general formula:\n$$\nF_{\\text{carrier}}(t) = 1 - [1 - F_{0}(t)]^{RR}\n$$\nThis is the exact relationship for cumulative risk under the proportional hazards model.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical evaluation to age $t=80$ years, given $F_{0}(80) = 0.12$ and $RR = 5$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\nF_{\\text{carrier}}(80) = 1 - [1 - F_{0}(80)]^{RR} = 1 - (1 - 0.12)^{5}\n$$\n$$\nF_{\\text{carrier}}(80) = 1 - (0.88)^{5}\n$$\nWe calculate $(0.88)^{5}$:\n$$\n(0.88)^{5} = 0.5277319168\n$$\nNow, we find the carrier risk:\n$$\nF_{\\text{carrier}}(80) = 1 - 0.5277319168 = 0.4722680832\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $4$, $7$, $2$, $2$. The fifth digit is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$\nF_{\\text{carrier}}(80) \\approx 0.4723\n$$\n\nFor completeness, we identify the first-order small-hazard approximation. This approximation arises when the cumulative hazard $\\Lambda(t)$ is small. From the Taylor series expansion of the exponential function, $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1-x$ for small $x$.\nThus, the risk function $F(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\Lambda(t))$ can be approximated as:\n$$\nF(t) \\approx 1 - (1 - \\Lambda(t)) = \\Lambda(t)\n$$\nThis means for small risks, the cumulative risk is approximately equal to the cumulative hazard. Applying this to both populations:\n$$\nF_{0}(t) \\approx \\Lambda_{0}(t) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad F_{\\text{carrier}}(t) \\approx \\Lambda_{\\text{carrier}}(t)\n$$\nUsing the established relationship $\\Lambda_{\\text{carrier}}(t) = RR \\times \\Lambda_{0}(t)$, we can write the approximate relationship between the risks:\n$$\nF_{\\text{carrier}}(t) \\approx RR \\times F_{0}(t)\n$$\nThis is the first-order small-hazard approximation. For the given values, this would yield $F_{\\text{carrier}}(80) \\approx 5 \\times 0.12 = 0.60$. This value of $0.60$ is substantially different from the exact value of $0.4723$, indicating that the risks involved are too large for this linear approximation to be accurate.

These two hypotheses are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. The available evidence consists of data from a functional assay, denoted $D_{func}$, and data from a segregation analysis, denoted $D_{seg}$.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n1.  The prior probability of pathogenicity for a missense variant in *BRCA2* is $P(H_P) = 0.1$.\n2.  The prior probability of being benign is therefore $P(H_B) = 1 - P(H_P) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9$.\n3.
