The use of Poisson statistics to model the random partitioning of molecules is the fundamental principle of dPCR. The values for volumes, partition numbers, and positive counts are realistic for a typical dPCR experiment. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data to calculate the requested concentration through a clear, logical sequence of steps. The language is objective and precise. There are no contradictions; for instance, the total volume of analyzed droplets ($N \\times v_p = 20000 \\times 0.85\\,\\mathrm{nL} = 17\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L})$ is less than the reaction volume ($V_{\\mathrm{rxn}} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$), which is expected due to partitioning inefficiency and dead volume.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe goal is to calculate the concentration of mutant target molecules in the original plasma sample, in units of copies per $\\mathrm{mL}$. The solution proceeds in four main steps:\n1.  Estimate the average number of molecules per partition ($\\lambda$) from the fraction of positive partitions.\n2.  Calculate the measured concentration in the dPCR reaction ($C_{\\mathrm{meas}}$) and apply the calibration curve to find the corrected concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{true}}$).\n3.  Use the dilution and concentration factors from the sample processing steps to back-calculate the concentration in the original plasma sample.\n4.  Compute the final numerical result and round to the specified precision.\n\nFirst, we model the distribution of molecules into the $N$ partitions using the Poisson distribution. The probability that a partition contains exactly $k$ molecules is given by $P(k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$, where $\\lambda$ is the average number of molecules per partition. A partition is positive if it contains one or more molecules ($k \\ge 1$), and negative if it is empty ($k=0$). The probability of a partition being negative is:\n$$P(k=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nThe experimentally observed fraction of negative partitions is $\\frac{N - \\hat{n}}{N}$. Equating the theoretical probability with the observed fraction allows us to estimate $\\lambda$:\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda) = \\frac{N - \\hat{n}}{N} = 1 - \\frac{\\hat{n}}{N}$$\nSolving for $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{\\hat{n}}{N}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the given values $\\hat{n} = 150$ and $N = 20000$:\n$$\\lambda = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{150}{20000}\\right) = -\\ln(1 - 0.0075) = -\\ln(0.9925)$$\n\nNext, we calculate the measured concentration in the reaction mixture, $C_{\\mathrm{meas}}$. This concentration is the average number of molecules per partition, $\\lambda$, divided by the volume of a single partition, $v_p$. We must ensure consistent units.\nGiven $v_p = 0.85\\,\\mathrm{nL}$, we convert it to $\\mu\\mathrm{L}$:\n$$v_p = 0.85\\,\\mathrm{nL} = 0.85 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$$\nThe measured concentration in copies per $\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ is:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{meas}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{v_p} = \\frac{-\\ln(0.9925)}{0.85 \\times 10^{-3}}\\,\\frac{\\text{copies}}{\\mu\\mathrm{L}}$$\n\nNow, we apply the laboratory's linear calibration curve to correct for systematic bias:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\alpha + \\beta\\,C_{\\mathrm{meas}}$$\nWith $\\alpha = 0.10$ and $\\beta = 0.95$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.10 + 0.95 \\left( \\frac{-\\ln(0.9925)}{0.85 \\times 10^{-3}} \\right)$$\nThis $C_{\\mathrm{true}}$ represents the bias-corrected concentration of target molecules in the dPCR reaction mixture, in units of copies per $\\mu\\mathrm{L}$.\n\nFinally, we must relate this concentration back to the original plasma sample. Let $C_{\\mathrm{plasma}}$ be the target concentration in plasma. The total number of target molecules in the plasma sample is $N_{\\mathrm{total}} = C_{\\mathrm{plasma}} \\times V_{\\mathrm{plasma}}$. These molecules are assumed to be recovered in the total nucleic acid extract volume, $V_{\\mathrm{ext}}$. Thus, the concentration in the extract is $C_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{total}}}{V_{\\mathrm{ext}}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{plasma}} V_{\\mathrm{plasma}}}{V_{\\mathrm{ext}}}$.\nA volume $V_{\\mathrm{in}}$ of this extract is then used to prepare the final reaction mixture of volume $V_{\\mathrm{rxn}}$. The concentration in this reaction mixture, which corresponds to our corrected measurement $C_{\\mathrm{true}}$, is:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{true}} = C_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\times \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}}{V_{\\mathrm{rxn}}} = \\left(\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{plasma}} V_{\\mathrm{plasma}}}{V_{\\mathrm{ext}}}\\right) \\times \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}}{V_{\\mathrm{rxn}}}$$\nWe can now solve for the desired quantity, $C_{\\mathrm{plasma}}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{plasma}} = C_{\\mathrm{true}} \\times \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{rxn}}}{V_{\\mathrm{in}}} \\times \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{V_{\\mathrm{plasma}}}$$\nWe need all volumes in consistent units to calculate the final concentration. The target unit is copies per $\\mathrm{mL}$, so we convert $V_{\\mathrm{plasma}} = 3\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ and leave it as is. The other volumes are in $\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. We need a conversion factor.

The sample consists of a mixture of cell-free DNA, with a fraction $f$ derived from tumor cells and a fraction $1-f$ derived from normal (non-tumor) cells. The analysis assumes that the number of DNA fragments sequenced from any given genomic locus is proportional to the number of copies of that locus in the contributing cell population.\n\nLet us model the total number of alleles and mutant alleles in the plasma sample.

Normal cells carry $0$ mutant copies. Mutant alleles originate exclusively from the tumor cell fraction. The tumor population is subclonal, with a fraction $q$ of tumor cells carrying the mutation. Each of these mutation-bearing cells has $m$ mutant copies.\n\nThe average number of mutant alleles per tumor cell is the weighted average across the subclonal populations:\n$$(\\text{Average mutant copies per tumor cell}) = q \\cdot m + (1-q) \\cdot 0 = qm$$\nThe number of mutant alleles contributed by the tumor DNA fraction, $f$, is proportional to this fraction multiplied by the average number of mutant copies per tumor cell genome.\n$$N_{alleles, mutant} \\propto f \\cdot (qm)$$\n\nThe VAF, $V$, is the ratio of the number of mutant alleles to the total number of alleles. The proportionality constants cancel out.\n$$V = \\frac{N_{alleles, mutant}}{N_{alleles, total}} = \\frac{f q m}{(1-f)C_n + fC_t}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the expected VAF.

A Type I error, or a false positive, occurs when a true null hypothesis $H_{0i}$ is incorrectly rejected. The FDR is the expected value of the ratio of false positives to the total number of discoveries (rejected hypotheses). Let $V$ be the number of false positives and $R$ be the total number of rejected hypotheses. The FDR is defined as $E[Q]$, where $Q = V/R$ if $R > 0$ and $Q=0$ if $R=0$. We want to find a procedure such that $E[Q] \\le \\alpha$.\n\nThe most widely used and principled method for this, under the assumption of test independence, is the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure. We will derive its justification.\n\nLet the $N$ $p$-values be ordered from smallest to largest: $p_{(1)} \\le p_{(2)} \\le \\dots \\le p_{(N)}$.

If such a $k$ exists, let it be $k_{max}$. Reject all null hypotheses $H_{0(i)}$ for $i=1, 2, \\dots, k_{max}$.\n3. If no such $k$ exists, do not reject any null hypotheses.\n\nThe number of declared positive loci is $k_{max}$.\n\nTo understand why this is a principled rule, we can analyze the inequality $p_{(k)} \\le \\frac{k}{N}\\alpha$. It can be rewritten as $\\frac{N p_{(k)}}{k} \\le \\alpha$. Let us interpret the term on the left-hand side.\n\nSuppose we decide to reject the $k$ hypotheses with the smallest $p$-values. The threshold we implicitly set is $t = p_{(k)}$.\n- $k$: This is $R$, the number of discoveries (rejections) we have made.\n- $p_{(k)}$: This is the $p$-value threshold for our $k$ discoveries.\n- Under the null hypothesis, $p$-values are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. If there are $N_0$ true null hypotheses among the $N$ tests, the expected number of false positives (true nulls with a $p$-value $\\le t$) is $E[V] = N_0 t$.\n- Since $N_0$ is unknown, we can use a conservative bound $N_0 \\le N$. The expected number of false positives is then bounded: $E[V] \\le N t$.\n- For our procedure that rejects $k$ hypotheses, the threshold is $t=p_{(k)}$, so we can estimate the expected number of false positives as being bounded by $N p_{(k)}$.\n- The ratio of the estimated expected false positives to the number of discoveries is $\\frac{N p_{(k)}}{k}$.\n\nThis ratio, $\\frac{N p_{(k)}}{k}$, can be seen as an estimate of the FDR if we were to declare $k$ loci as positive. The BH procedure scans for the largest number of rejections, $k$, for which this estimated FDR is still controlled at or below the desired level $\\alpha$. By taking the largest $k$ (most lenient threshold) that satisfies the condition, the procedure maximizes the number of discoveries while provably maintaining $FDR \\le \\frac{N_0}{N}\\alpha \\le \\alpha$ under the independence of tests.
