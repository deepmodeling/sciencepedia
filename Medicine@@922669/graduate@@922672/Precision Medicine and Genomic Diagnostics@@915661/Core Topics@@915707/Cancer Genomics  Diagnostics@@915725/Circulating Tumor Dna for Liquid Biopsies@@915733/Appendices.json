When searching for Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), where tumor fractions ($f$) can be exceedingly low, detection becomes a statistical challenge of sampling.

Briefly discuss the implication of your result for MRD sampling depth in the context of ctDNA assays.", "solution": "The problem asks us to derive the detection probability for a ctDNA liquid biopsy assay modeled by a Poisson process and then to calculate the minimum number of input molecules required to achieve a specific detection probability.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement. The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular diagnostics and statistics. The use of a Poisson distribution to model the number of rare events (detection of mutant DNA fragments) over a large number of trials (input molecules) is a standard and appropriate approximation of the binomial distribution. The given parameters, a low tumor fraction $f$ and a capture efficiency $\\epsilon$, are well-defined and realistic for Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) scenarios. The problem is self-contained, well-posed, and requires a rigorous, formal solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nLet $n$ be the total number of independent input DNA molecules.\nLet $f$ be the probability that any given molecule is tumor-derived.\nLet $\\epsilon$ be the conditional probability that a tumor-derived molecule is successfully captured and sequenced.\n\nThe probability, $p$, that a single, randomly chosen input molecule is a successfully detected mutant molecule is the product of the probability of it being tumor-derived and the probability of it being captured, given that it is tumor-derived.\n$$p = f \\cdot \\epsilon$$\nThis is the per-trial success probability.\n\nThe problem states that the number of captured mutant molecules, let's denote this random variable as $X$, is to be modeled by a Poisson distribution, $X \\sim \\text{Pois}(\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the rate parameter. The problem also specifies that the expected number of captured molecules, $E[X]$, is the product of the number of trials, $n$, and the per-trial success probability, $p$. For a Poisson distribution, the expected value is equal to its rate parameter, $E[X] = \\lambda$.\nTherefore, we can establish the rate parameter as:\n$$\\lambda = n \\cdot p = n f \\epsilon$$\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of a Poisson-distributed random variable $X$ for observing exactly $k$ events is given by:\n$$P(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\lambda$, we get:\n$$P(X=k) = \\frac{(n f \\epsilon)^k \\exp(-n f \\epsilon)}{k!}$$\n\nThe \"detection probability\" is defined as the probability of observing at least one mutant molecule, which is $P(X \\ge 1)$. It is more convenient to calculate this using the complement event, which is observing zero mutant molecules, $P(X=0)$.\n$$P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0)$$\nUsing the Poisson PMF for $k=0$:\n$$P(X=0) = \\frac{(n f \\epsilon)^0 \\exp(-n f \\epsilon)}{0!} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\exp(-n f \\epsilon)}{1} = \\exp(-n f \\epsilon)$$\nThus, the detection probability, which we can denote as $P_D$, as a function of $n$, $f$, and $\\epsilon$ is:\n$$P_D(n, f, \\epsilon) = 1 - \\exp(-n f \\epsilon)$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we are given specific values for the MRD scenario:\n- Tumor-derived fraction, $f = 7.5 \\times 10^{-6}$\n- Capture efficiency, $\\epsilon = 0.32$\n- Desired minimum detection probability, $P_D \\ge 0.95$\n\nWe need to find the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies this condition. We set up the inequality:\n$$1 - \\exp(-n f \\epsilon) \\ge 0.95$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $n$:\n$$\\exp(-n f \\epsilon) \\le 1 - 0.95$$\n$$\\exp(-n f \\epsilon) \\le 0.05$$\nTo isolate the exponent, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. Since $\\ln(x)$ is a monotonically increasing function, the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n$$\\ln(\\exp(-n f \\epsilon)) \\le \\ln(0.05)$$\n$$-n f \\epsilon \\le \\ln(0.05)$$\nNow, we multiply by $-1$. This requires reversing the direction of the inequality:\n$$n f \\epsilon \\ge -\\ln(0.05)$$\nUsing the logarithm property $-\\ln(x) = \\ln(1/x)$:\n$$n f \\epsilon \\ge \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.05}\\right)$$\n$$n f \\epsilon \\ge \\ln(20)$$\nFinally, we solve for $n$:\n$$n \\ge \\frac{\\ln(20)}{f \\epsilon}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for $f$ and $\\epsilon$:\n$$n \\ge \\frac{\\ln(20)}{(7.5 \\times 10^{-6}) \\cdot (0.32)}$$\nFirst, calculate the product in the denominator:\n$$f \\epsilon = (7.5 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 0.32 = 2.4 \\times 10^{-6}$$\nNow, substitute this back into the inequality:\n$$n \\ge \\frac{\\ln(20)}{2.4 \\times 10^{-6}}$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(20) \\approx 2.99573227355$:\n$$n \\ge \\frac{2.99573227355}{2.4 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 1248221.78$$\nSince $n$ must represent an integer number of molecules, we must find the smallest integer that satisfies this condition. This is the ceiling of the calculated value.\n$$n = \\lceil 1248221.78 \\rceil = 1248222$$\nTherefore, a minimum of $1,248,222$ independent DNA molecules are required as input to the assay to achieve a detection probability of at least $95\\%$.\n\nThe implication of this result is profound for MRD testing. To reliably detect an extremely low disease burden (e.g., a tumor fraction of $f = 7.5 \\times 10^{-6}$), a very large number of DNA molecules must be sampled and analyzed. This translates to a requirement for high \"sampling depth.\" In practical terms, this means that a significant volume of blood must be drawn from the patient to obtain enough cell-free DNA, and the subsequent sequencing experiment must be designed for high depth (i.e., a large number of sequencing reads) to ensure the statistical power to detect the rare mutant fragments. This calculation underscores why MRD detection is a technically challenging and costly endeavor, as it pushes the limits of current sequencing technologies and requires careful consideration of pre-analytical variables (DNA extraction) and analytical variables (assay efficiency and sequencing depth). Failure to sample a sufficient number of molecules (i.e., having an insufficient $n$) would lead to an unacceptably high rate of false-negative results, where MRD is present but not detected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1248222}$$", "id": "4322290"}, {"introduction": "Beyond single-point detection, the true power of ctDNA lies in its ability to dynamically track tumor burden over time.
