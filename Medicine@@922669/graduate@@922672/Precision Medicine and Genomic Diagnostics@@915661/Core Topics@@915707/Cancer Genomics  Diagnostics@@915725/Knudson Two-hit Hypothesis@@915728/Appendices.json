The tumor arose by Knudson’s two-hit mechanism at the Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) locus: the first hit is a clonal truncating point mutation, and the second hit is clonal copy-neutral Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH), meaning one parental allele is lost and the remaining allele is duplicated without net change in total copy number.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, providing a clear basis for a formal derivation.\n\nThe goal is to derive the expected Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) of a truncating mutation at the Retinoblastoma 1 ($RB1$) locus as a function of tumor purity, $p$. The VAF is defined as the ratio of the number of allele copies carrying the variant to the total number of allele copies at that specific genomic locus within the sequenced sample.\n$$ \\text{VAF} = \\frac{\\text{Number of variant allele copies}}{\\text{Total number of allele copies}} $$\nLet $p$ be the tumor purity, which is the fraction of DNA in the sample originating from tumor cells. Consequently, the fraction of DNA originating from normal cells is $1-p$.\n\nWe are given the following information about the state of the $RB1$ locus in the two cell populations:\n1.  **Normal Cells**: These cells are diploid and contain two wild-type copies of the $RB1$ gene. Let's denote the wild-type allele as $W$. The genotype of a normal cell is therefore $W/W$. The total copy number at this locus is $2$.\n2.  **Tumor Cells**: These cells have undergone two clonal events. The first was a point mutation, creating a variant allele, $V$. The second was a copy-neutral Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH), where the remaining wild-type allele was lost and the variant allele was duplicated. This results in a genotype of $V/V$. The total copy number at this locus is also $2$, as the LOH was copy-neutral.\n\nThe problem assumes unbiased sequencing, meaning that every allele copy in the mixture has an equal probability of being sequenced. Therefore, the VAF can be calculated directly from the proportion of variant alleles in the total pool of alleles in the DNA sample.\n\nLet us determine the total number of variant alleles and the total number of alleles in the sample. We can express these quantities in terms of an arbitrary total number of alleles in the sample, $N_{total}$.\n\nSince both normal and tumor cells have a total copy number of $2$ at the $RB1$ locus, the fraction of total alleles contributed by each cell type is directly proportional to their DNA fraction in the sample.\n- The number of alleles contributed by tumor cells is $N_{tumor\\_alleles} = p \\cdot N_{total}$.\n- The number of alleles contributed by normal cells is $N_{normal\\_alleles} = (1-p) \\cdot N_{total}$.\n\nNext, we count the number of variant alleles ($V$) from each population:\n- In the tumor cell population (genotype $V/V$), both copies are the variant allele. Thus, the fraction of variant alleles is $1$. The number of variant alleles from tumor cells is $1 \\cdot N_{tumor\\_alleles} = 1 \\cdot (p \\cdot N_{total}) = p \\cdot N_{total}$.\n- In the normal cell population (genotype $W/W$), there are no variant alleles. The fraction of variant alleles is $0$. The number of variant alleles from normal cells is $0 \\cdot N_{normal\\_alleles} = 0$.\n\nThe total number of variant alleles in the sample, $N_{variant}$, is the sum of contributions from both populations:\n$$ N_{variant} = (\\text{variant alleles from tumor}) + (\\text{variant alleles from normal}) $$\n$$ N_{variant} = p \\cdot N_{total} + 0 = p \\cdot N_{total} $$\nThe total number of alleles at the locus, $N_{total}$, is the sum of alleles from the tumor and normal populations:\n$$ N_{total} = N_{tumor\\_alleles} + N_{normal\\_alleles} = p \\cdot N_{total} + (1-p) \\cdot N_{total} = (p + 1 - p) \\cdot N_{total} = N_{total} $$\nNow we can compute the VAF using its definition:\n$$ \\text{VAF} = \\frac{N_{variant}}{N_{total}} $$\nSubstituting the expression we derived for $N_{variant}$:\n$$ \\text{VAF} = \\frac{p \\cdot N_{total}}{N_{total}} $$\nThe term $N_{total}$ cancels out, yielding the relationship between VAF and purity $p$:\n$$ \\text{VAF} = p $$\nThus, for a clonal mutation in a region of copy-neutral LOH where the mutated allele is duplicated, the expected variant allele fraction is equal to the tumor purity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{p}$$", "id": "4354697"}, {"introduction": "Real tumor samples are rarely as simple as the idealized case, often comprising a heterogeneous mix of cells.

The sample is a mixture of three distinct cell populations:\n1.  Normal cells (N): These constitute a fraction $1-p$ of the total cells. They are diploid and heterozygous ($AB$), so their locus copy number is $CN_N = 2$, and their B-allele count is $B_N = 1$.\n2.  Unaltered tumor cells (T_U): These constitute a fraction $p(1-c)$ of the total cells.

Altered tumor cells (T_A): These constitute a fraction $pc$ of the total cells. Their copy number, $CN_{T_A}$, and B-allele count, $B_{T_A}$, depend on the specific somatic event.\n\nThe average locus copy number in the mixed sample, $\\langle CN \\rangle$, is the weighted average over these three populations:\n$$\n\\langle CN \\rangle = (1-p)CN_N + p(1-c)CN_{T_U} + pc \\cdot CN_{T_A}\n$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\n\\langle CN \\rangle = (1-p)(2) + p(1-c)(2) + pc \\cdot CN_{T_A}\n$$\n$$\n\\langle CN \\rangle = 2 - 2p + 2p - 2pc + pc \\cdot CN_{T_A} = 2 - 2pc + pc \\cdot CN_{T_A}\n$$\n$$\n\\langle CN \\rangle = 2 + pc(CN_{T_A} - 2)\n$$\nThe read depth ratio, $R$, is defined as the ratio of $\\langle CN \\rangle$ in the tumor sample to the average copy number in a pure normal sample.

A second hit by Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) would remove the remaining wild-type allele in some or all tumor cells. You interrogate a genomic segment spanning the locus using nearby heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to infer LOH from sequencing read counts. Consider the following foundational facts as the base for inference:\n- In a bulk sample, observed reads are a mixture of normal and tumor cells. Let tumor purity be $p \\in [0,1]$, the fraction of tumor DNA in the specimen; the normal fraction is then $1-p$.\n- A genomic event may be subclonal, present in only a fraction $f \\in [0,1]$ of tumor cells; $f=1$ denotes a fully clonal event within the tumor compartment.\n- At a diploid locus in normal cells, the total copy number is $C_n=2$, and for a heterozygous SNP the minor-allele copy count is $m_n=1$.\n- Within the tumor compartment at a genomic segment, the baseline (pre-event) total copy number is $C_t$ and minor-allele copy count is $m_t$. After an LOH event in a subclone, the post-event total copy number is $C_t'$ and post-event minor-allele copy count is $m_t'$ (for a deletion removing the minor allele, $C_t'=1$ and $m_t'=0$; for copy-neutral LOH, $C_t'=2$ and $m_t'=0$).\n- Sequencing reads from a heterozygous SNP are sampled in proportion to the underlying allele copy counts contributed by each mixture component, subject to binomial counting noise and potential overdispersion from technical factors, while total depth scales approximately with total copy number.\nYou wish to explain, from these first principles, why variable tumor purity and subclonality confound naive LOH inference from observed allele fractions, and to outline a joint generative model that accounts for copy number, purity, and clonal fraction to improve LOH accuracy. Which option below provides a correct explanation of the confounding and a coherent joint model specification that links the expected minor-allele fraction and total copy ratio to $(p,f,C_t,C_t',m_t,m_t')$, and uses an appropriate likelihood to estimate these quantities from SNP-level allele counts and segment-level depth?\n\nA. Purity and subclonality both dilute the deviation from balanced allelic sampling by averaging in normal cells and non-event tumor cells, respectively. The expected minor-allele fraction at a heterozygous SNP is the mixture of minor-allele copies over total copies across components, $$\\pi=\\frac{(1-p)m_n+p\\big((1-f)m_t+f\\,m_t'\\big)}{(1-p)C_n+p\\big((1-f)C_t+f\\,C_t'\\big)}$$ For a single-allele deletion removing the minor allele in the subclone ($C_n=2$, $m_n=1$, $C_t=2$, $m_t=1$, $C_t'=1$, $m_t'=0$), this reduces to $$\\pi=\\frac{1-pf}{2-pf},$$ showing how either lower $p$ or lower $f$ drives $\\pi$ toward the balanced value $1/2$ even when LOH is present. The expected segment copy ratio (relative to diploid) is $$r=\\frac{(1-p)C_n+p\\big((1-f)C_t+f\\,C_t'\\big)}{2},$$ with log-transformed depth modeled as Gaussian around $\\log_2 r$. Across $S$ SNPs with minor-allele counts $x_s$ out of $n_s$ reads, use a Beta-Binomial likelihood $x_s\\sim\\mathrm{BetaBinomial}(n_s,\\pi,\\rho)$ to absorb overdispersion, and combine with a Gaussian for segment depth to jointly estimate $(p,f)$ and allele-specific copy numbers by maximum likelihood or Expectation-Maximization (EM). This joint model disambiguates low purity from subclonality and copy-number state, improving LOH calls consistent with Knudson’s second hit.\n\nB. Subclonality determines the degree of allelic imbalance independently of purity, so the expected minor-allele fraction is $\\pi=\\tfrac{1}{2}(1-f)$. Copy number only affects read depth variance, not the expected ratio, so the expected copy ratio is $r=1$ regardless of $p$. LOH can thus be inferred from the median SNP minor-allele fraction alone using a fixed threshold, and purity is unnecessary.\n\nC. Purity reduces the minor-allele fraction by a fixed offset, giving $\\pi=\\frac{1-p}{2}+p(1-f)\\frac{1}{2}$ for all LOH types, since the denominator remains $2$. Copy number can be inferred from tumor-only data as $r=\\frac{C_t'}{2}$, and the normal contribution is negligible. LOH can be called by flagging segments where the median SNP minor-allele fraction is below $0.4$.\n\nD. Because LOH eliminates one allele, it suffices to ignore subclonality and set $\\pi=\\frac{(1-p)m_n+p\\,m_t}{(1-p)C_n+p\\,C_t}$, which collapses tumor into a single state. Joint modeling with copy number is unnecessary; allelic fractions alone, smoothed across SNPs, feed an EM algorithm to estimate $p$ and call LOH whenever $\\pi<0.45$.\n\nE. The normal compartment does not affect allele fractions, so $\\pi=\\frac{1-pf}{2}$, and the expected copy ratio is $r=\\frac{C_t'}{2}$ for any mixture. Because LOH is a qualitative event, depth data add no value once allele fractions are available; purity can be estimated after LOH calling by regressing $\\pi$ on $f$.", "solution": "The problem statement poses a valid and well-defined question in the field of computational cancer genomics. It is scientifically grounded, objective, and provides a complete set of first principles for deriving a solution. The core task is to formulate a mathematical model that describes how observed sequencing data (allele counts at heterozygous SNPs and read depth) depend on underlying biological parameters: tumor purity ($p$), the clonal fraction of a genomic event ($f$), and allele-specific copy numbers. This model should explain the confounding nature of purity and subclonality and form the basis for a robust statistical inference method.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nLet us derive the expected values for the two key observables: the minor-allele fraction ($\\pi$) and the total copy ratio ($r$). The bulk tumor sample is a mixture of three distinct cell populations, each contributing DNA to the sequencing library in proportion to its prevalence and copy number.\n\nThe three populations are:\n1.  Normal cells, with fraction $1-p$.\n2.  Tumor cells without the LOH event (non-event subclone), with fraction $p(1-f)$.\n3.  Tumor cells with the LOH event (event subclone), with fraction $pf$.\n\nThe given copy number states are:\n- Normal cells: Total copies $C_n=2$, minor-allele copies $m_n=1$.\n- Non-event tumor cells: Total copies $C_t$, minor-allele copies $m_t$.\n- Event tumor cells: Total copies $C_t'$, minor-allele copies $m_t'$.\n\n**1. Expected Minor-Allele Fraction ($\\pi$)**\n\nThe expected minor-allele fraction, $\\pi$, is the total number of minor-allele copies in the mixture divided by the total number of all allele copies in the mixture. We can express this as a weighted average, where the weights are the fractional contributions of each cell population.\n\nTotal contribution of minor-allele copies:\n$$ N_{\\text{minor}} \\propto (1-p) m_n + p(1-f) m_t + pf m_t' $$\n\nTotal contribution of all copies (major and minor):\n$$ N_{\\text{total}} \\propto (1-p) C_n + p(1-f) C_t + pf C_t' $$\n\nThe expected fraction $\\pi$ is the ratio of these quantities:\n$$ \\pi = \\frac{N_{\\text{minor}}}{N_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{(1-p) m_n + p\\big((1-f) m_t + f m_t'\\big)}{(1-p) C_n + p\\big((1-f) C_t + f C_t'\\big)} $$\n\n**2. Expected Total Copy Ratio ($r$)**\n\nThe total copy ratio, $r$, is defined as the average copy number of the bulk sample relative to the copy number of a normal diploid genome, which is $2$. The average copy number of the bulk sample, $C_{\\text{avg}}$, is the denominator we just calculated, $N_{\\text{total}}$, but let's re-state it for clarity:\n$$ C_{\\text{avg}} = (1-p) C_n + p\\big((1-f) C_t + f C_t'\\big) $$\n\nThe copy ratio is therefore:\n$$ r = \\frac{C_{\\text{avg}}}{2} = \\frac{(1-p) C_n + p\\big((1-f) C_t + f C_t'\\big)}{2} $$\n\n**3. Confounding Effects of Purity ($p$) and Subclonality ($f$)**\n\nLet's examine the common case of LOH occurring in a previously diploid region. The germline variant is heterozygous.\n- Normal cells: $C_n=2$, $m_n=1$.\n- Tumor cells (baseline): $C_t=2$, $m_t=1$.\n- Tumor cells with LOH through deletion of the minor allele: $C_t'=1$, $m_t'=0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for $\\pi$:\n$$ \\pi = \\frac{(1-p) \\cdot 1 + p\\big((1-f) \\cdot 1 + f \\cdot 0\\big)}{(1-p) \\cdot 2 + p\\big((1-f) \\cdot 2 + f \\cdot 1\\big)} = \\frac{1-p+p-pf}{2-2p+2p(1-f)+pf} = \\frac{1-pf}{2-2p+2p-2pf+pf} = \\frac{1-pf}{2-pf} $$\nIn a normal heterozygous state without LOH, the expected minor allele fraction is $0.5$. The LOH signal is the deviation of $\\pi$ from $0.5$. The expression $\\pi = (1-pf)/(2-pf)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of the product $pf$. If $p=1$ and $f=1$ (pure, clonal LOH), $\\pi = (1-1)/(2-1) = 0$, a very strong signal. However, if purity is low (e.g., $p=0.2, f=1$), then $\\pi = (1-0.2)/(2-0.2) = 0.8/1.8 \\approx 0.444$. Similarly, if the event is subclonal (e.g., $p=1, f=0.2$), $\\pi = (1-0.2)/(2-0.2) \\approx 0.444$. In both cases, the observed allele fraction is pushed closer to the balanced heterozygous value of $0.5$, confounding the detection of LOH. This demonstrates that low purity and low subclonality have similar effects on the observed allele fraction, making them difficult to distinguish with allelic-fraction data alone.\n\n**4. A Coherent Joint Model**\n\nTo disambiguate these effects, one must jointly model allele fractions and total copy number. The observables are SNP-level allele counts ($x_s$ minor alleles out of $n_s$ total reads at SNP $s$) and segment-level read depth.\n- The allele counts $x_s$ can be modeled using a likelihood function. The Binomial distribution, $x_s \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n_s, \\pi)$, is a first approximation. To account for technical variability and other sources of noise beyond simple counting statistics (overdispersion), the Beta-Binomial distribution, $x_s \\sim \\text{BetaBinomial}(n_s, \\pi, \\rho)$, is superior. Here $\\rho$ is an overdispersion parameter.\n- The read depth of the segment is proportional to the copy ratio $r$. It is standard to model the logarithm of the observed depth ratio as being normally distributed around the logarithm of the expected ratio $r$: $\\log_2(\\text{depth ratio}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\log_2(r), \\sigma^2)$.\n\nBy constructing a joint likelihood function that combines the Beta-Binomial likelihood for all SNPs in a segment and the Gaussian likelihood for the segment's depth, one can perform a joint estimation of the parameters $(p, f)$ and the integer copy numbers $(C_t, m_t, C_t', m_t')$ using techniques like Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) or Expectation-Maximization (EM). This joint approach leverages the distinct ways these parameters affect allele balance versus total copy number, allowing for their accurate deconvolution.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Purity and subclonality both dilute the deviation...** This option correctly states that both factors dilute the LOH signal. It presents the exact formula for the expected minor allele fraction $\\pi$ derived above. It correctly simplifies this formula for the specific case of a single-allele deletion and accurately interprets the confounding effect. It also presents the correct formula for the expected copy ratio $r$. Finally, it proposes a statistically sound joint model using a Beta-Binomial likelihood for allele counts to handle overdispersion and a Gaussian likelihood for log-transformed depth, with joint estimation via MLE or EM. This is a complete and accurate description of the problem and its solution.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Subclonality determines the degree of allelic imbalance independently of purity...** This statement is fundamentally incorrect. Purity is a critical parameter, as the normal cells contribute alleles and dilute the tumor signal. The provided formula for $\\pi$, $\\pi=\\tfrac{1}{2}(1-f)$, wrongly ignores both the normal cell contribution and the copy number changes in the denominator. The claim that $r=1$ is also false, as copy number events in the tumor clearly alter the average copy number of the bulk sample.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Purity reduces the minor-allele fraction by a fixed offset...** The formula presented, $\\pi=\\frac{1-p}{2}+p(1-f)\\frac{1}{2}$, is mathematically incorrect. It is an invalid attempt at averaging fractions and incorrectly assumes the total copy number in the denominator is always $2$. The formula for the copy ratio, $r=\\frac{C_t'}{2}$, is also wrong, as it neglects the contribution of normal cells and non-event tumor cells, which is only valid for the hypothetical case of $p=1$ and $f=1$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Because LOH eliminates one allele, it suffices to ignore subclonality...** This option's premise is flawed. Ignoring subclonality ($f$) is a gross oversimplification that fails to model a key aspect of tumor biology and a primary confounder in the data. The problem statement explicitly mentions subclonal events. Likewise, ignoring copy number information discards a crucial source of data for disambiguating purity, subclonality, and specific LOH mechanisms (e.g., deletion vs. copy-neutral LOH).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The normal compartment does not affect allele fractions...** This initial assertion is false. Normal cells are heterozygous and contribute a signal of $\\pi=0.5$, which is a major component of the mixture. The provided formula for $\\pi$, $\\pi=\\frac{1-pf}{2}$, incorrectly sets the denominator to a constant $2$, ignoring the copy number loss in the LOH subclone. The formula for $r$ is incorrect for a mixture, and the claim that depth data adds no value is contradicted by decades of work in cancer genomics.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4354753"}]}
