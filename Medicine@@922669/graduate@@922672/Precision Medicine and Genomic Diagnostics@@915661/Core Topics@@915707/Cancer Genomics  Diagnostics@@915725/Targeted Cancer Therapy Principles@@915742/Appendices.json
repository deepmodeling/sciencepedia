The framework presented is a standard and fundamental model used in cancer genomics to interpret sequencing data. All terms are clearly defined, and the assumptions, while idealizations, are appropriate for establishing a first-principles model. The problem is self-contained, with no missing information or contradictions. It is a formalizable and non-trivial problem directly relevant to the principles of targeted cancer therapy.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe variant allele fraction, `VAF`, is defined as the total number of mutant alleles divided by the total number of alleles (mutant and wild-type) at a specific locus within the entire cell population being sequenced. We are given the assumption that the number of sequenced alleles is large, allowing us to equate the `VAF` with its expected value based on the cellular composition of the sample.\n\nLet us consider a representative collection of cells from the specimen. By definition, a fraction `\\pi` of these cells are tumor cells, and the remaining fraction, `1-\\pi`, are normal cells.\n\nThe number of mutant alleles is contributed exclusively by the tumor cells, as the normal cells are stated to carry no mutant copies. In a population of tumor cells, each cell has `m` mutant alleles. Therefore, the contribution of mutant alleles from the tumor compartment is proportional to the number of tumor cells and the number of mutant alleles per tumor cell, which can be expressed as `\\pi \\times m`.\n\nThe total number of alleles at the locus is the sum of alleles from both the tumor and normal cell compartments.\nThe contribution of alleles from the tumor compartment is proportional to the fraction of tumor cells, `\\pi`, and the total copy number in each tumor cell, `C_t`. This contribution is `\\pi \\times C_t`.\nThe contribution of alleles from the normal compartment is proportional to the fraction of normal cells, `1-\\pi`, and the total copy number in each normal cell, `C_n`. This contribution is `(1-\\pi) \\times C_n`.\n\nThe total number of alleles in the sample is the sum of these contributions: `\\pi C_t + (1-\\pi) C_n`.\n\nThe expected `VAF` is the ratio of the total number of mutant alleles to the total number of all alleles. We can thus write the closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\text{VAF} = \\frac{\\text{Number of mutant alleles}}{\\text{Total number of alleles}} = \\frac{\\pi m}{\\pi C_t + (1-\\pi) C_n}\n$$\nThis equation provides the theoretical `VAF` as a function of tumor purity (`\\pi`), mutant allele copy number (`m`), and the total copy numbers in the tumor (`C_t`) and normal (`C_n`) cell populations.\n\nQualitatively, this expression reveals how copy number variations affect the expected `VAF`.\nIf a copy number gain occurs in the tumor such that the mutant allele is not duplicated, `C_t` increases while `m` remains constant. Examining the formula, an increase in `C_t` increases the denominator, `\\pi C_t + (1-\\pi) C_n`, while the numerator, `\\pi m`, remains unchanged. This leads to a decrease in the `VAF`. This phenomenon is often referred to as \"allelic dilution,\" where the newly gained wild-type copies dilute the proportional representation of the mutant allele within the tumor cell's genomic content, and consequently, in the overall sample.\n\nConversely, if a copy number amplification occurs that duplicates the mutant allele, both `m` and `C_t` increase. For example, if a chromosome arm containing the mutation is duplicated, `m` could increase from `1` to `2` and `C_t` from `2` to `4`. The increase in `m` directly increases the numerator `\\pi m`, which tends to raise the `VAF`. Although `C_t` also increases, tending to lower the `VAF`, the increase in `m` often has a dominant effect. For a clonal mutation, the `VAF` is amplified, potentially exceeding the canonical `0.5` value expected for a heterozygous mutation in a pure diploid sample. This is critical for interpreting clonality; a high `VAF` does not necessarily imply high purity but could instead indicate a copy number amplification of the mutant allele, a key feature in oncogenesis.\n\nWe now evaluate this expression for the two specific scenarios.\n\n**Scenario 1:** Heterozygous clonal SNV in a diploid tumor.\nThe given parameters are:\n-   Tumor purity, `\\pi = 0.6`\n-   Tumor copy number, `C_t = 2`\n-   Mutant allele copies in tumor, `m = 1`\n-   Normal copy number, `C_n = 2`\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\text{VAF}_1 = \\frac{(0.6)(1)}{(0.6)(2) + (1-0.6)(2)} = \\frac{0.6}{1.2 + (0.4)(2)} = \\frac{0.6}{1.2 + 0.8} = \\frac{0.6}{2.0} = 0.3\n$$\nExpressed to four significant figures, the `VAF` is `0.3000`.\n\n**Scenario 2:** The same SNV with a single-copy amplification in the tumor.\nThe given parameters are:\n-   Tumor purity, `\\pi = 0.6`\n-   Tumor copy number, `C_t = 3`\n-   Mutant allele copies in tumor, `m = 1`\n-   Normal copy number, `C_n = 2`\n\nHere, the copy number gain did not duplicate the mutant allele, exemplifying the dilution effect discussed earlier.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\n\\text{VAF}_2 = \\frac{(0.6)(1)}{(0.6)(3) + (1-0.6)(2)} = \\frac{0.6}{1.8 + (0.4)(2)} = \\frac{0.6}{1.8 + 0.8} = \\frac{0.6}{2.6}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{VAF}_2 = \\frac{6}{26} = \\frac{3}{13} \\approx 0.2307692...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the `VAF` is `0.2308`. As predicted by the qualitative analysis, the `VAF` is lower in this scenario compared to the diploid case, despite identical tumor purity, because the additional wild-type allele in the tumor cells dilutes the mutant allele's frequency.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.3000 & 0.2308 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4387935"}, {"introduction": "The efficacy of a targeted therapy is directly related to its ability to engage and occupy its molecular target.

The total receptor concentration, $[R]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the free receptor concentration, $[R]$, and the concentration of the ligand-receptor complex, $[RL]$.\n$$[R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [RL]$$\nThe occupancy is therefore:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$$\nThe problem provides the equilibrium expression for the dissociation constant, $K_{d}$:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[R]C}{[RL]}$$\nFrom this expression, we can solve for the free receptor concentration $[R]$ in terms of $[RL]$, $C$, and $K_{d}$:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_{d}[RL]}{C}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the occupancy equation:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\frac{K_{d}[RL]}{C} + [RL]}$$\nAssuming a non-zero drug concentration and binding, $[RL]$ is non-zero and can be factored out from the denominator:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL]\\left(\\frac{K_{d}}{C} + 1\\right)}$$\nCanceling the $[RL]$ term yields the occupancy as a function of the free drug concentration $C$ and the dissociation constant $K_{d}$:\n$$\\theta(C, K_{d}) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{d}}{C} + 1} = \\frac{C}{C + K_{d}}$$\nThis is the standard Hill-Langmuir isotherm for single-site binding.\n\n**Part 2: Compute the Change in Occupancy**\n\nThe wild-type (pre-mutation) system has a dissociation constant of $K_{d}$. At a free drug concentration $C$, the occupancy, $\\theta_{\\text{WT}}$, is:\n$$\\theta_{\\text{WT}} = \\frac{C}{C + K_{d}}$$\nThe resistant mutant has a dissociation constant of $10K_{d}$. At the same free drug concentration $C$, the occupancy, $\\theta_{\\text{mut}}$, is:\n$$\\theta_{\\text{mut}} = \\frac{C}{C + 10K_{d}}$$\nThe change in occupancy, $\\Delta\\theta$, is defined as $\\theta_{\\text{mut}} - \\theta_{\\text{WT}}$:\n$$\\Delta\\theta = \\frac{C}{C + 10K_{d}} - \\frac{C}{C + K_{d}}$$\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator, which is $(C + 10K_{d})(C + K_{d})$:\n$$\\Delta\\theta = \\frac{C(C + K_{d}) - C(C + 10K_{d})}{(C + 10K_{d})(C + K_{d})}$$\nExpanding the terms in the numerator:\n$$\\Delta\\theta = \\frac{(C^2 + CK_{d}) - (C^2 + 10CK_{d})}{(C + 10K_{d})(C + K_{d})}$$\n$$\\Delta\\theta = \\frac{C^2 + CK_{d} - C^2 - 10CK_{d}}{(C + 10K_{d})(C + K_{d})}$$\nSimplifying the numerator gives the final expression for the change in occupancy:\n$$\\Delta\\theta = \\frac{-9CK_{d}}{(C + 10K_{d})(C + K_{d})}$$\n\n**Part 3: Determine the Dose Increase Factor**\n\nThe goal is to find a new free drug concentration, let's call it $C'$, that restores the occupancy of the mutant receptor to the original level of the wild-type receptor, $\\theta_{\\text{WT}}$.\nThe target occupancy is $\\theta_{\\text{target}} = \\theta_{\\text{WT}} = \\frac{C}{C + K_{d}}$.\nThe new occupancy for the mutant at concentration $C'$ is $\\theta_{\\text{mut}}(C') = \\frac{C'}{C' + 10K_{d}}$.\nWe must set $\\theta_{\\text{mut}}(C') = \\theta_{\\text{target}}$:\n$$\\frac{C'}{C' + 10K_{d}} = \\frac{C}{C + K_{d}}$$\nTo solve for $C'$, we cross-multiply:\n$$C'(C + K_{d}) = C(C' + 10K_{d})$$\n$$C'C + C'K_{d} = CC' + 10CK_{d}$$\nThe term $C'C$ appears on both sides and cancels out:\n$$C'K_{d} = 10CK_{d}$$\nSince $K_{d}$ is a physical constant and thus non-zero, we can divide both sides by $K_{d}$:\n$$C' = 10C$$\nThis result indicates that to restore the original occupancy, the free drug concentration must be increased by a factor of $10$.\nThe problem states that pharmacokinetics are linear, meaning that the steady-state concentration $C$ is directly proportional to the administered dose. Therefore, to achieve a $10$-fold increase in concentration (from $C$ to $10C$), the dose must also be increased by a multiplicative factor of $10$.\n\nThe two results are the expression for $\\Delta\\theta$ and the numerical factor $10$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{-9CK_{d}}{(C + 10K_{d})(C + K_{d})} & 10 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4387985"}, {"introduction": "An effective targeted inhibitor is characterized not only by how tightly it binds to its target (affinity) but also by how long it remains bound (residence time).
