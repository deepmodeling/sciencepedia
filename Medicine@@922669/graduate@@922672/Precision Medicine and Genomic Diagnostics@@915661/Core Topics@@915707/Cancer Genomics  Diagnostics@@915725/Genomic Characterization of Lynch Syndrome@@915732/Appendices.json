MSI is a key biomarker for Lynch syndrome and for predicting response to immunotherapy in colorectal cancer. The use of a panel of markers, defining instability based on a statistical shift, and calculating a percentage of unstable markers to classify a tumor as MSI-High or MSS (Microsatellite Stable) is standard practice in genomic diagnostics. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary variables for the calculation ($N$, $U$, $\\theta$) are explicitly provided. The definitions of the MSI score $S$ and the indicator $\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{MSI-High}}$ are clear and unambiguous, leading to a unique solution. The value of $\\tau_z$ is mentioned but not required for the calculation, as the outcome of the per-locus test (the value of $U$) is given directly. This does not render the problem incomplete.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, technical language common in the field of genomics and bioinformatics. It is free from subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed for invalidation. It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, consistent, and well-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to compute the value of the classification indicator $\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{MSI-High}}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the MSI score, $S$, for the given tumor specimen. The formula for the MSI score is given as the empirical fraction of unstable loci:\n$$S = \\frac{U}{N}$$\nThe problem provides the specific values for the number of unstable loci, $U = 35$, and the total number of assessed loci, $N = 200$. Substituting these values into the formula gives:\n$$S = \\frac{35}{200}$$\nThis fraction can be simplified. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by $5$ yields:\n$$S = \\frac{7}{40}$$\nTo compare this score with the clinical cutoff $\\theta$, it is convenient to express $S$ as a decimal.\n$$S = 0.175$$\n\nNext, we apply the classification rule. A tumor is designated as MSI-High if its MSI score $S$ is greater than or equal to the clinical cutoff $\\theta$. The given cutoff is:\n$$\\theta = 0.20$$\nWe must compare the calculated score $S = 0.175$ with this cutoff value:\n$$0.175 \\ge 0.20$$\nThis inequality is false. Therefore, the condition $S \\ge \\theta$ is not met.\n\nFinally, we determine the value of the classification indicator, $\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{MSI-High}}$. The indicator is defined as:\n$$\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{MSI-High}} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } S \\ge \\theta \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } S < \\theta \\end{cases}$$\nSince our comparison showed that $S < \\theta$, the value of the indicator is $0$.\n$$\\mathbb{I}_{\\text{MSI-High}} = 0$$\nThe tumor specimen is classified as Microsatellite Stable (MSS), not MSI-High.
