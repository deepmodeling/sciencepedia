Histopathological assessment and computational deconvolution both concordantly estimate tumor purity to be $0.40$ (fraction of tumor cells), with the remainder being non-neoplastic tissue. At a locus of interest, copy-number profiling indicates copy-neutral diploidy and no allele-specific imbalance. A somatic Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) is assessed to be clonal (present in all tumor cells) and heterozygous (one mutated allele and one wild-type allele per tumor cell).

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular genetics and oncology, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is stated using objective, formal language. The problem is a direct application of fundamental definitions to a realistic, albeit simplified, scenario in genomic diagnostics.\n\nThe Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) is defined as the fraction of sequencing reads at a specific genomic locus that carry the variant allele, out of the total number of reads covering that locus. Under the stated assumption that sequencing is unbiased and the DNA from all cells is equally represented, the expected VAF is equivalent to the proportion of variant alleles in the total pool of DNA from the mixed cell population.\n\nWe are given the following variables and conditions:\n- Tumor purity, $p = 0.40$. This represents the fraction of tumor cells in the sample.\n- The fraction of normal, non-neoplastic cells is therefore $1 - p = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$.\n- The locus is in a state of copy-neutral diploidy. This means both tumor cells and normal cells have a copy number of $2$ at this locus. Let $CN_T$ be the copy number in tumor cells and $CN_N$ be the copy number in normal cells. Thus, $CN_T = 2$ and $CN_N = 2$.\n- The Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV) is clonal, meaning it is present in all tumor cells.\n- The SNV is heterozygous in the tumor cells. This means each tumor cell contains one mutated (variant) allele and one wild-type allele at this locus. Let $M_T$ be the number of mutated alleles per tumor cell. Therefore, $M_T = 1$.\n- As the mutation is somatic, the normal cells do not carry the variant. Let $M_N$ be the number of mutated alleles per normal cell. Thus, $M_N = 0$.\n\nTo derive the expected VAF, we calculate the total number of mutated alleles and the total number of all alleles (mutated and wild-type) in a representative sample. We can express these quantities in terms of the fractional contributions from the tumor ($p$) and normal ($1-p$) cell populations.\n\nThe number of mutated alleles in the sample is determined solely by the tumor compartment, as the normal cells are wild-type. The contribution to the mutated allele pool from the tumor fraction is proportional to the fraction of tumor cells multiplied by the number of mutated alleles per tumor cell.\nProportional number of mutated alleles = $p \\times M_T = 0.40 \\times 1 = 0.40$.\n\nThe total number of alleles at this locus in the sample is the sum of alleles from both the tumor and normal compartments.\n- Proportional number of alleles from the tumor fraction = $p \\times CN_T = 0.40 \\times 2 = 0.80$.\n- Proportional number of alleles from the normal fraction = $(1 - p) \\times CN_N = (1 - 0.40) \\times 2 = 0.60 \\times 2 = 1.20$.\n\nThe total proportional number of all alleles in the sample is the sum of these contributions:\nTotal proportional number of alleles = $(p \\times CN_T) + ((1 - p) \\times CN_N) = 0.80 + 1.20 = 2.00$.\nThis result is expected, as every cell in the sample (both tumor and normal) is diploid at this locus, so there are two alleles per cell on average.\n\nThe expected VAF is the ratio of the proportional number of mutated alleles to the total proportional number of all alleles.\n$$ VAF = \\frac{p \\times M_T}{p \\times CN_T + (1 - p) \\times CN_N} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ VAF = \\frac{0.40 \\times 1}{(0.40 \\times 2) + (0.60 \\times 2)} $$\n$$ VAF = \\frac{0.40}{0.80 + 1.20} $$\n$$ VAF = \\frac{0.40}{2.00} $$\n$$ VAF = 0.20 $$\nA simpler form of the equation for the specific case of a clonal heterozygous SNV in a diploid region (where $M_T=1$, $CN_T=2$, $CN_N=2$) is:\n$$ VAF = \\frac{p \\times 1}{p \\times 2 + (1 - p) \\times 2} = \\frac{p}{2p + 2 - 2p} = \\frac{p}{2} $$\nUsing this simplified formula:\n$$ VAF = \\frac{0.40}{2} = 0.20 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a unitless decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ VAF = 0.2000 $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.2000}\n$$", "id": "4362134"}, {"introduction": "Tumor Mutational Burden ($TMB$) has emerged as a key biomarker, but its calculation is more complex than simply counting mutations.

The solution requires a step-by-step derivation from first principles as laid out in the problem statement.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by addressing the three specified tasks in order.\n\n**1. Definition of Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB)**\n\nAs stated in the problem and consistent with standard practice in the field, Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) is a quantitative measure of genomic instability in a tumor. It is defined as the total number of somatic, coding, nonsynonymous mutations identified in a tumor specimen, normalized by the size of the genomic region that was effectively interrogated by the sequencing assay. The normalization accounts for the portion of the gene panel that is \"callable,\" meaning the region where mutations could have been reliably detected given the quality and depth of the sequencing data. The final value is typically expressed in units of mutations per megabase (mut/Mb).\n\n**2. Derivation of Callable Megabases**\n\nThe calculation of the callable genomic territory begins with the intended target size of the assay and sequentially applies filters for mappability, sequencing depth, and base quality.\n\nLet $S_{intended}$ be the intended coding target size of the panel, which is given as $1.92$ Mb.\n\nFirst, we account for regions that are excluded due to low mappability or presence on a blacklist. A fraction $f_{map\\_exclude} = 0.08$ of the intended target is removed. The remaining high-mappability territory, $S_{mappable}$, is:\n$$S_{mappable} = S_{intended} \\times (1 - f_{map\\_exclude})$$\n$$S_{mappable} = 1.92 \\, \\text{Mb} \\times (1 - 0.08) = 1.92 \\, \\text{Mb} \\times 0.92 = 1.7664 \\, \\text{Mb}$$\n\nNext, we apply the depth-of-coverage filter. The assay's callability definition requires a minimum deduplicated depth of $80 \\times$. The given depth distribution applies to the high-mappability territory, $S_{mappable}$. The fraction of bases meeting the depth requirement, $f_{depth\\_pass}$, is the sum of the fractions of bases at depth $\\geq 120 \\times$ and at depth in the range $[80, 119]$.\n$$f_{depth\\_pass} = f_{\\text{depth} \\geq 120} + f_{80 \\leq \\text{depth} \\leq 119}$$\n$$f_{depth\\_pass} = 0.55 + 0.30 = 0.85$$\nThe size of the territory that meets both mappability and depth criteria, $S_{depth\\_ok}$, is:\n$$S_{depth\\_ok} = S_{mappable} \\times f_{depth\\_pass}$$\n$$S_{depth\\_ok} = 1.7664 \\, \\text{Mb} \\times 0.85 = 1.50144 \\, \\text{Mb}$$\n\nFinally, a base-quality filter is applied. This filter removes a fraction $f_{bq\\_fail} = 0.02$ of the bases that would otherwise be considered callable (i.e., those within $S_{depth\\_ok}$). The final callable territory, $S_{callable}$, is therefore:\n$$S_{callable} = S_{depth\\_ok} \\times (1 - f_{bq\\_fail})$$\n$$S_{callable} = 1.50144 \\, \\text{Mb} \\times (1 - 0.02) = 1.50144 \\, \\text{Mb} \\times 0.98$$\n$$S_{callable} = 1.4714112 \\, \\text{Mb}$$\n\nSo, the total size of the callable region interrogated by the assay is $1.4714112$ Mb.\n\n**3. Computation of TMB**\n\nTo compute the TMB, we first need to determine the total number of somatic nonsynonymous coding mutations, which serves as the numerator. The problem provides a list of detected high-confidence somatic variants, all of which are nonsynonymous and alter the resulting protein product. These include single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (indels). We sum the counts for all listed categories:\n$$N_{mut} = N_{\\text{missense}} + N_{\\text{nonsense}} + N_{\\text{splice}} + N_{\\text{frameshift}} + N_{\\text{in-frame}}$$\n$$N_{mut} = 26 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 34$$\nThe total count of nonsynonymous mutations is $34$.\n\nNow, we can compute the TMB using the provided formula, dividing the total mutation count by the callable territory in megabases:\n$$TMB = \\frac{N_{mut}}{S_{callable}}$$\n$$TMB = \\frac{34}{1.4714112 \\, \\text{Mb}} \\approx 23.106509 \\, \\frac{\\text{mut}}{\\text{Mb}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$TMB \\approx 23.1 \\, \\frac{\\text{mut}}{\\text{Mb}}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{23.1}$$", "id": "4362124"}, {"introduction": "A common and critical challenge in tumor-only sequencing is determining whether a detected variant is somatic (acquired by the tumor) or germline (inherited), a distinction with profound clinical implications. This problem [@problem_id:4362117] moves beyond simple Variant Allele Fraction ($VAF$) estimation to a formal hypothesis test. It challenges you to use a statistical likelihood approach to rigorously assess which model—germline or somatic—is better supported by the sequencing data given the tumor purity and copy-number state.", "problem": "A molecular tumor board is reviewing a tumor-only targeted sequencing report for a frameshift variant in the BRCA1 gene. The observed Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) is $0.45$ at a total sequencing depth of $D=200$ reads, implying $k=90$ variant-supporting reads. Pathology estimates tumor purity to be $f=0.60$. Independent copy-number analysis shows a copy-neutral diploid state at the BRCA1 locus with no evidence of Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH). The board wants to assess whether the variant is more consistent with a germline heterozygous variant or a somatic clonal heterozygous variant present in all tumor cells, under the following assumptions: (i) copy-neutral diploid state in both tumor and normal compartments, (ii) no subclonality, (iii) independent read sampling such that variant reads are distributed according to a binomial model with success probability equal to the true underlying VAF.\n\nStarting from the definitions of tumor purity, allele copy number in diploid cells, and the binomial model for read sampling, derive the expected VAF under the germline model and under the somatic model.

State the final result without units.", "solution": "The problem requires an assessment of two competing hypotheses for a detected genetic variant: a germline heterozygous model and a somatic clonal heterozygous model. This assessment will be performed by calculating the base-$10$ logarithm of the likelihood ratio of the two models, given the sequencing data.\n\nFirst, we establish a mathematical framework to determine the expected variant allele fraction (VAF) for a sample that is a mixture of normal and tumor cells. Let $f$ be the tumor purity, representing the fraction of tumor cells in the sample. Consequently, the fraction of normal cells is $1-f$. The problem states that cells in both compartments are in a copy-neutral diploid state, meaning each cell has a total of $C=2$ copies of the gene locus in question.\n\nThe expected VAF, which we denote as $p$, is the ratio of the total number of variant alleles to the total number of alleles across all cells in the sample. Let $A_{v,T}$ be the number of variant alleles in a single tumor cell and $A_{v,N}$ be the number of variant alleles in a single normal cell. The total number of alleles in the tumor fraction is proportional to $f \\times C$ and in the normal fraction is proportional to $(1-f) \\times C$. Similarly, the number of variant alleles is proportional to $f \\times A_{v,T}$ and $(1-f) \\times A_{v,N}$.\n\nThus, the general formula for the expected VAF is:\n$$p = \\frac{f \\cdot A_{v,T} + (1-f) \\cdot A_{v,N}}{f \\cdot C + (1-f) \\cdot C}$$\nGiven that $C=2$ for a diploid state, this simplifies to:\n$$p = \\frac{f \\cdot A_{v,T} + (1-f) \\cdot A_{vN}}{2}$$\n\nWe now apply this framework to the two models.\n\nModel 1: Germline Heterozygous Variant ($H_g$)\nUnder this model, the variant is inherited and present in every cell of the body, both normal and tumor. A heterozygous state means there is $1$ variant allele and $1$ wild-type allele. Therefore, $A_{v,N} = 1$ and $A_{v,T} = 1$.\nThe expected VAF for the germline model, $p_g$, is:\n$$p_g = \\frac{f \\cdot 1 + (1-f) \\cdot 1}{2} = \\frac{f + 1 - f}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$\n\nModel 2: Somatic Clonal Heterozygous Variant ($H_s$)\nUnder this model, the variant is acquired somatically within the tumor lineage and is absent from normal cells. Thus, $A_{v,N} = 0$. The variant is clonal, meaning it is present in all tumor cells. It is heterozygous, and there is no LOH, so tumor cells have $1$ variant allele and $1$ wild-type allele, meaning $A_{v,T} = 1$.\nThe expected VAF for the somatic model, $p_s$, depends on the tumor purity $f$:\n$$p_s = \\frac{f \\cdot 1 + (1-f) \\cdot 0}{2} = \\frac{f}{2}$$\nUsing the given tumor purity $f=0.60$, we calculate the expected VAF for the somatic model:\n$$p_s = \\frac{0.60}{2} = 0.30$$\n\nThe problem provides the sequencing data: $k=90$ variant-supporting reads out of a total sequencing depth of $D=200$ reads.
