Consider a single-nucleotide variant classified as clonal and heterozygous, located in a copy-number-neutral diploid region with no copy number variation (CNV). The tumor purity is $p=0.70$ (i.e., $70\\%$ of nucleated cells in the specimen are tumor cells), and the remaining $1-p$ fraction are normal diploid cells without the variant. Using first principles of mixture contributions from tumor and normal compartments, derive the expected VAF for a clonal heterozygous mutation under these conditions.

All terms are well-defined, and the provided data are sufficient and consistent for deriving a unique solution. The scenario is a standard, albeit simplified, model used in clinical bioinformatics for interpreting sequencing data.\n\nThe solution proceeds by deriving the expected VAF from first principles. The specimen is a mixture of two cell populations: tumor cells and normal cells.\n\nLet $p$ be the tumor purity, which is the fraction of cells in the specimen that are tumor cells. We are given $p=0.70$.\nThe fraction of normal cells is therefore $1-p = 1-0.70 = 0.30$.\n\nWe analyze the allelic composition of each cell population at the locus of interest.\n1.  **Tumor Cell Population**: This population constitutes a fraction $p$ of the total cells. The cells are diploid, and the variant is clonal and heterozygous.\n    -   *Clonal* means every tumor cell contains the variant.\n    -   *Heterozygous* means each tumor cell has one mutant allele (M) and one wild-type allele (W).\n    -   Therefore, within the tumor cell compartment, the allele ratio of M to W is $1:1$.\n\n2.  **Normal Cell Population**: This population constitutes a fraction $1-p$ of the total cells. The cells are diploid and do not carry the variant.\n    -   Each normal cell has two wild-type alleles (W, W).\n    -   Therefore, within the normal cell compartment, the allele ratio of M to W is $0:2$.\n\nThe VAF is the proportion of mutant alleles among all alleles at that locus in the entire specimen. We assume that each cell contributes equally to the total pool of DNA that is sequenced. Let $C$ be the total number of cells in the sample.\n\nThe number of tumor cells is $p \\times C$.\nThe number of normal cells is $(1-p) \\times C$.\n\nSince all cells are diploid, each cell contains $2$ alleles at the locus.\n\nThe total number of mutant alleles in the specimen comes exclusively from the tumor cells.\n-   Number of mutant alleles from tumor cells = (Number of tumor cells) $\\times$ (Number of mutant alleles per tumor cell) = $(p \\times C) \\times 1 = pC$.\n\nThe total number of alleles (both mutant and wild-type) in the specimen is the sum of alleles from both tumor and normal cells.\n-   Total alleles from tumor cells = (Number of tumor cells) $\\times$ ($2$ alleles per cell) = $(p \\times C) \\times 2 = 2pC$.\n-   Total alleles from normal cells = (Number of normal cells) $\\times$ ($2$ alleles per cell) = $((1-p) \\times C) \\times 2 = 2(1-p)C$.\n-   Total alleles in the specimen = (Total alleles from tumor) + (Total alleles from normal) = $2pC + 2(1-p)C = 2C(p + 1 - p) = 2C$.\n\nThe expected VAF, $\\text{VAF}_{\\text{exp}}$, is the ratio of the total number of mutant alleles to the total number of alleles in the specimen.\n$$\n\\text{VAF}_{\\text{exp}} = \\frac{\\text{Total Mutant Alleles}}{\\text{Total Alleles}} = \\frac{pC}{2C}\n$$\nThe total cell count $C$ cancels, yielding the formula for the expected VAF of a clonal, heterozygous variant in a diploid, copy-neutral region:\n$$\n\\text{VAF}_{\\text{exp}} = \\frac{p}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the given tumor purity $p=0.70$:\n$$\n\\text{VAF}_{\\text{exp}} = \\frac{0.70}{2} = 0.35\n$$\n\nThe problem provides an observed VAF, $\\text{VAF}_{\\text{obs}} = 0.36$.\nWe are asked to compute the absolute deviation, $d$:\n$$\nd = |\\text{VAF}_{\\text{obs}} - \\text{VAF}_{\\text{exp}}|\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nd = |0.36 - 0.35| = 0.01\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

It is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The values are realistic. The problem is valid.\n\nThe derivation of the expression for the tumor cell copy number, $CN_{tumor}$, proceeds from the simple mixture model provided. The observed copy number, $CN_{obs}$, is the sum of the copy numbers from the tumor and normal cell populations, weighted by their respective fractions in the sample. The fraction of tumor cells is the purity, $p$, and the fraction of normal cells is $1-p$.\nThe model is thus expressed as:\n$$CN_{obs} = (p \\times CN_{tumor}) + ((1-p) \\times CN_{normal})$$\nThe problem states that the normal cell population is diploid, meaning its copy number is $2$. Therefore, $CN_{normal} = 2$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$CN_{obs} = p \\cdot CN_{tumor} + (1-p) \\cdot 2$$\nTo find the expression for $CN_{tumor}$, we rearrange this equation algebraically:\n$$p \\cdot CN_{tumor} = CN_{obs} - 2(1-p)$$\n$$CN_{tumor} = \\frac{CN_{obs} - 2(1-p)}{p}$$\nThis is the required expression for the tumor-specific copy number.\n\nNext, we compute the value of $CN_{tumor}$ using the provided data: $CN_{obs} = 10$ and $p = 0.60$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$CN_{tumor} = \\frac{10 - 2(1 - 0.60)}{0.60}$$\n$$CN_{tumor} = \\frac{10 - 2(0.40)}{0.60}$$\n$$CN_{tumor} = \\frac{10 - 0.80}{0.60}$$\n$$CN_{tumor} = \\frac{9.2}{0.60}$$\n$$CN_{tumor} = \\frac{46}{3} \\approx 15.3333...$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures as required gives $CN_{tumor} = 15.33$.\n\nFinally, we determine the actionability tier for this finding under the joint AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines for the interpretation of somatic variants in cancer. The guidelines classify variants into four tiers based on clinical significance.\n- Tier I: Strong clinical significance (variants that define a standard-of-care therapy for a given tumor type).\n- Tier II: Potential clinical significance.\n- Tier III: Uncertain clinical significance.\n- Tier IV: Benign or likely benign.\n\nThe finding is a high-level amplification of the $ERBB2$ ($HER2$) gene in a patient with metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma. Amplification of $ERBB2$ is a well-established, FDA-approved predictive biomarker for response to the targeted agent trastuzumab in this specific disease. Clinical guidelines universally recommend testing for $ERBB2$ status in metastatic gastric cancer to guide treatment decisions. The calculated tumor-specific copy number of approximately $15.33$ confirms a high-level amplification state. A variant that has a direct, guideline-endorsed therapeutic implication with an approved drug in a specific disease context is classified as having strong clinical significance.\nTherefore, this $ERBB2$ amplification is a Tier I variant. The problem requests this tier be encoded numerically as $1$.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix containing the calculated $CN_{tumor}$ (rounded to four significant figures) and the numeric tier code.\nThe first entry is $15.33$.\nThe second entry is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n15.33 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4385150"}, {"introduction": "This exercise moves from single-gene analysis to a broader genomic biomarker, Tumor Mutational Burden ($TMB$), which quantifies the overall mutation load of a tumor.
