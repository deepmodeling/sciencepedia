The specimen is a heterogeneous mixture of tumor cells and non-malignant normal cells. The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in the principles of cancer genomics.\n\nFirst, we establish a mathematical model based on the provided information. The sample consists of two cell populations: tumor cells, which constitute a fraction $p$ of the total cells, and normal cells, which constitute the remaining fraction $1-p$. The sequencing reads are assumed to be drawn from a pool of DNA fragments originating from both cell types.\n\nThe expected VAF is defined as the fraction of variant alleles relative to the total number of alleles at the specified locus in the DNA pool. Under the assumption of high sequencing depth and unbiased allele sampling, this is equivalent to the ratio of the total number of variant allele copies to the total number of all copies of the locus across the entire cell mixture.\n\nLet's derive the expressions for the total number of copies and the number of variant copies. The contribution of each cell type to the DNA pool is proportional to its cellular fraction and the copy number of the locus in that cell type.\n\nThe total number of copies of the locus, which we can denote as $\\mathcal{N}_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of copies from the tumor and normal cells.\nThe tumor cells are present at a fraction $p$ and have a total copy number of $C_t$ at the locus. Their contribution is proportional to $p \\cdot C_t$.\nThe normal cells are present at a fraction $1-p$ and have a total copy number of $C_n$. Their contribution is proportional to $(1-p) \\cdot C_n$.\nTherefore, the total number of copies is proportional to the sum of these contributions:\n$$ \\mathcal{N}_{\\text{total}} \\propto p \\cdot C_t + (1-p) \\cdot C_n $$\n\nNext, we determine the number of variant allele copies, denoted as $\\mathcal{N}_{\\text{variant}}$. The problem states the variant is somatic, meaning it is present in the tumor cells but absent from the normal (germline) cells. The normal cells thus contribute zero variant copies.\nIn the tumor cells, the variant is clonal and has a multiplicity of $q$, meaning it is present on $q$ of the $C_t$ total copies. The contribution of variant copies from the tumor cells is proportional to $p \\cdot q$.\nThus, the total number of variant copies is:\n$$ \\mathcal{N}_{\\text{variant}} \\propto p \\cdot q $$\n\nThe expected VAF is the ratio of the number of variant copies to the total number of copies:\n$$ E[\\text{VAF}] = \\frac{p \\cdot q}{p \\cdot C_t + (1-p) \\cdot C_n} $$\n\nThis is the general formula for the expected VAF of a clonal somatic mutation. Now, we use the specific values provided in the problem statement:\n- Tumor purity: $p = 0.68$\n- Total copy number in normal cells: $C_n = 2$\n- Total copy number in the tumor segment: $C_t = 3$\n- Multiplicity of the variant in tumor cells: $q = 1$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ E[\\text{VAF}] = \\frac{(0.68) \\cdot (1)}{(0.68) \\cdot (3) + (1 - 0.68) \\cdot (2)} $$\n\nWe calculate the numerator and the denominator separately.\nThe numerator is:\n$$ p \\cdot q = 0.68 \\times 1 = 0.68 $$\nThe denominator is:\n$$ p \\cdot C_t + (1-p) \\cdot C_n = (0.68)(3) + (0.32)(2) $$\n$$ = 2.04 + 0.64 $$\n$$ = 2.68 $$\nNow, we compute the final ratio:\n$$ E[\\text{VAF}] = \\frac{0.68}{2.68} $$\n$$ E[\\text{VAF}] \\approx 0.253731343... $$\n\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures.

The use of the $d_{N}/d_{S}$ ratio (also known as the $K_a/K_s$ or $\\omega$ ratio) is a fundamental and widely accepted method in molecular evolution and cancer genomics to detect selection. The distinction between driver and passenger mutations based on evidence of positive selection is a central concept in precision medicine.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data ($N$, $S$, $O_{N}$, $O_{S}$) to compute the required quantity. The request for a maximum likelihood estimate leads to a unique and meaningful solution.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The data are complete and internally consistent. The values for mutation counts and opportunities are plausible for a single gene aggregated over a cancer cohort.\n5.  **Realism**: The premise and data are realistic within the context of a modern cancer genomics study.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the ratio $d_{N}/d_{S}$. Let us formally define the substitution rates. The nonsynonymous substitution rate, $d_{N}$, is the number of nonsynonymous mutations per nonsynonymous site. Similarly, the synonymous substitution rate, $d_{S}$, is the number of synonymous mutations per synonymous site.\n\nThe observed counts of mutations, $N$ and $S$, can be modeled as outcomes of two independent Poisson processes.\nThe number of nonsynonymous mutations, $N$, is a Poisson random variable with rate parameter $\\lambda_{N} = d_{N} O_{N}$.\n$$N \\sim \\text{Poisson}(d_{N} O_{N})$$\nThe number of synonymous mutations, $S$, is a Poisson random variable with rate parameter $\\lambda_{S} = d_{S} O_{S}$.\n$$S \\sim \\text{Poisson}(d_{S} O_{S})$$\nThe likelihood function $L$ for the parameters $d_{N}$ and $d_{S}$ given the data $N$ and $S$ is the product of the two Poisson probability mass functions:\n$$L(d_{N}, d_{S} | N, S) = \\frac{\\exp(-d_{N} O_{N})(d_{N} O_{N})^{N}}{N!} \\cdot \\frac{\\exp(-d_{S} O_{S})(d_{S} O_{S})^{S}}{S!}$$\nTo find the MLEs, we maximize the log-likelihood function, $\\ln(L)$:\n$$\\ln(L) = -d_{N} O_{N} + N \\ln(d_{N} O_{N}) - \\ln(N!) - d_{S} O_{S} + S \\ln(d_{S} O_{S}) - \\ln(S!)$$\nTaking the partial derivatives with respect to $d_{N}$ and $d_{S}$ and setting them to zero gives:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\ln(L)}{\\partial d_{N}} = -O_{N} + \\frac{N}{d_{N}} = 0 \\implies \\hat{d}_{N, \\text{MLE}} = \\frac{N}{O_{N}}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\ln(L)}{\\partial d_{S}} = -O_{S} + \\frac{S}{d_{S}} = 0 \\implies \\hat{d}_{S, \\text{MLE}} = \\frac{S}{O_{S}}$$\nThese estimators, $\\hat{d}_{N, \\text{MLE}}$ and $\\hat{d}_{S, \\text{MLE}}$, represent the estimated rates as the observed number of mutations divided by the respective number of opportunities.\n\nBy the invariance property of maximum likelihood estimators, the MLE of a function of parameters is the function of the MLEs of those parameters. Therefore, the MLE for the ratio $\\omega = d_{N}/d_{S}$ is:\n$$\\hat{\\omega}_{\\text{MLE}} = \\frac{\\hat{d}_{N, \\text{MLE}}}{\\hat{d}_{S, \\text{MLE}}} = \\frac{N/O_{N}}{S/O_{S}} = \\frac{N \\cdot O_{S}}{S \\cdot O_{N}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given values into this formula:\n$N = 27$\n$S = 6$\n$O_{N} = 2400$\n$O_{S} = 800$\n\n$$\\frac{\\hat{d}_{N}}{\\hat{d}_{S}} = \\frac{27 \\cdot 800}{6 \\cdot 2400}$$\nWe can simplify this expression:\n$$\\frac{\\hat{d}_{N}}{\\hat{d}_{S}} = \\frac{27}{6} \\cdot \\frac{800}{2400} = \\frac{27}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}$$\n$$\\frac{\\hat{d}_{N}}{\\hat{d}_{S}} = \\frac{9}{6} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact value is $1.5$, which written to four significant figures is $1.500$.\n\n### Step 3: Assessment of the Result\n\nThe computed estimate for the $d_{N}/d_{S}$ ratio is $1.500$. According to the principles of molecular evolution provided in the problem statement, a ratio greater than $1$ ($d_{N}/d_{S}  1$) is indicative of positive selection. The neutral expectation, corresponding to mutations having no effect on fitness (i.e., passenger mutations), is $d_{N}/d_{S} = 1$.\n\nOur result of $1.500$ shows an excess of nonsynonymous substitutions relative to what would be expected under neutrality. In the context of cancer, positive selection implies that the nonsynonymous mutations are not random, neutral events. Instead, they confer a selective advantage to the cancer cells, such as increased proliferation, survival, or metastasis. Genes that accumulate such advantageous mutations are, by definition, \"driver genes\" because they actively contribute to the progression of the disease. Therefore, the observation that $\\hat{d}_{N}/\\hat{d}_{S} \\approx 1.5$ strongly supports the hypothesis that this receptor tyrosine kinase gene is acting as a driver gene in lung adenocarcinoma.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.500}$$", "id": "4335677"}, {"introduction": "Driver mutations do not act in isolation; they function within complex signaling pathways, where a single activating mutation is often sufficient.

By contrast, passenger mutations should not exhibit such structured exclusivity beyond what random chance would produce under the null of independent, randomly distributed mutations conditioned on observed totals. Consider a cohort of $N=30$ tumors profiled by targeted panel sequencing for the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway genes *KRAS*, *BRAF*, and *NRAS*. Let $m_{g}$ denote the number of tumors with at least one nonsynonymous mutation in gene $g$, and let $x_{g,h}$ denote the number of tumors that harbor mutations in both genes $g$ and $h$.

Specifically, for a pair $(g,h)$ with $K=m_{g}$, $n=m_{h}$, and observed overlap $x_{\\mathrm{obs}}=x_{g,h}$, the exclusivity $p$-value is defined as $p_{\\mathrm{excl}}=\\Pr[X \\le x_{\\mathrm{obs}}]$ where $X$ is the random overlap under sampling without replacement across $N$ tumors.\n\nThen, to construct a pathway-level mutual exclusivity test that controls the family-wise error rate across the three pairs, apply the Bonferroni correction with $m=3$ tests and report the corrected $p$-value based on the smallest pairwise exclusivity $p$-value.

The principle of mutual exclusivity posits that driver mutations in different genes of the same pathway are evolutionarily selected against co-occurring in the same tumor, as one such mutation is typically sufficient to dysregulate the pathway. Conversely, passenger mutations, which do not confer a selective growth advantage, are expected to co-occur at a rate predictable by random chance. The task is to quantify the statistical evidence for mutual exclusivity for each gene pair and then to derive a pathway-level significance score.\n\nThe null hypothesis ($H_0$) states that mutations in any two genes are independent events, conditioned on the observed total number of tumors mutated in each gene. This scenario is equivalent to sampling without replacement. We consider a population of $N$ tumors. Within this population, $K=m_g$ tumors are mutated in gene $g$. We then observe which of these tumors are also mutated in gene $h$; this is analogous to drawing a sample of size $n=m_h$ (the number of tumors mutated in gene $h$) and counting how many have the \"mutated in gene $g$\" property. The number of co-mutated tumors, denoted by the random variable $X$, follows a hypergeometric distribution.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of the hypergeometric distribution is given by:\n$$ \\Pr[X=k] = \\frac{\\binom{K}{k} \\binom{N-K}{n-k}}{\\binom{N}{n}} $$\nwhere $N$ is the total population size, $K$ is the number of successes in the population, $n$ is the sample size, and $k$ is the number of successes in the sample.
