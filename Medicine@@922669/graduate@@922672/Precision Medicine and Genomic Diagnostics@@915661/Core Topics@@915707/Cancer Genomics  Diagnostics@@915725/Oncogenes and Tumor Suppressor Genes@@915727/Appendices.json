By calculating the Variant Allele Frequency ($VAF$) for a homozygous tumor suppressor mutation, you will master the fundamental formula that connects tumor purity, copy number, and allelic state to the sequencing data we observe. This skill is essential for developing an intuition for what genomic data should look like and for identifying deviations from expectation.", "problem": "A precision oncology laboratory performs targeted sequencing on a tumor sample to assess the status of a tumor suppressor gene. The sample contains a mixture of tumor and normal cells, with tumor DNA fraction (tumor purity) $p=0.6$. At the locus of interest, single-nucleotide variant analysis reveals a pathogenic alteration that is homozygous in the tumor cells due to copy-neutral Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH). Copy-neutral Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) is defined as a state in which one parental homolog is lost and the remaining homolog is duplicated, restoring the total copy number to the baseline ploidy but eliminating heterozygosity. The total copy number of the locus in tumor cells is $c_{total}=2$, and normal cells are diploid with total copy number $2$. Variant Allele Frequency (VAF) is defined as the fraction of sequencing reads at the locus that carry the variant allele, which, under unbiased sampling, equals the fraction of variant allele copies among all allele copies present in the admixture of tumor and normal DNA.\n\nStarting from these definitions and the assumption that sequencing read sampling is proportional to allele copy number in the mixture, derive an expression for the expected VAF in terms of the relevant quantities and compute its value for this scenario. Then, interpret the result in the context of clonality and biallelic inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene under copy-neutral LOH.\n\nExpress the computed VAF as a decimal fraction. No rounding is necessary if the value is exact.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary parameters and definitions for a rigorous solution are provided. The scenario described—assessing Variant Allele Frequency (VAF) in a mixed tumor-normal sample with a homozygous mutation arising from copy-neutral Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)—is a standard and fundamental problem in cancer genomics. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be derived.\n\nThe primary objective is to derive an expression for the expected Variant Allele Frequency (VAF) and compute its value for the given scenario. The VAF is defined as the fraction of sequencing reads carrying the variant allele. Under the assumption of unbiased sampling, this is equivalent to the ratio of the total number of variant allele copies to the total number of all allele copies (variant and wild-type) in the entire cell mixture.\n\nLet us define the relevant parameters:\n- $p$: the tumor DNA fraction, or tumor purity.\n- $1-p$: the fraction of normal DNA in the sample.\n- $c_{t,v}$: the copy number of the variant allele in a tumor cell.\n- $c_{t,w}$: the copy number of the wild-type allele in a tumor cell.\n- $c_{t}$: the total copy number of the locus in a tumor cell, where $c_t = c_{t,v} + c_{t,w}$.\n- $c_{n,v}$: the copy number of the variant allele in a normal cell.\n- $c_{n,w}$: the copy number of the wild-type allele in a normal cell.\n- $c_{n}$: the total copy number of the locus in a normal cell, where $c_n = c_{n,v} + c_{n,w}$.\n\nThe total number of variant alleles in the sample is a weighted sum from the tumor and normal cell populations. The contribution from the tumor population is proportional to $p \\cdot c_{t,v}$, and the contribution from the normal population is proportional to $(1 - p) \\cdot c_{n,v}$.\n\nThe total number of all alleles at the locus in the sample is similarly a weighted sum of the total copy numbers in each cell type. The contribution from the tumor population is proportional to $p \\cdot c_{t}$, and from the normal population is proportional to $(1 - p) \\cdot c_{n}$.\n\nThus, the general formula for the VAF is:\n$$\n\\text{VAF} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of variant allele copies}}{\\text{Total number of all allele copies}} = \\frac{p \\cdot c_{t,v} + (1 - p) \\cdot c_{n,v}}{p \\cdot c_{t} + (1 - p) \\cdot c_{n}}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the specific values provided in the problem statement into this general expression.\nThe givens are:\n- Tumor purity, $p = 0.6$. The fraction of normal cells is therefore $1 - p = 0.4$.\n- The alteration in tumor cells is homozygous due to copy-neutral LOH. The total copy number in tumor cells is $c_{t} = 2$. Homozygosity for the pathogenic alteration means both alleles are the variant form. Therefore, the copy number of the variant allele in tumor cells is $c_{t,v} = 2$, and the copy number of the wild-type allele is $c_{t,w} = 0$. This is consistent with the total copy number, as $c_t = 2 + 0 = 2$.\n- Normal cells are diploid with a total copy number of $c_{n} = 2$. As the pathogenic alteration is a somatic event confined to the tumor, the normal (germline) cells are assumed to be homozygous wild-type. This means they do not carry the variant allele. Therefore, the copy number of the variant allele in normal cells is $c_{n,v} = 0$, and the copy number of the wild-type allele is $c_{n,w} = 2$. This is consistent with the total copy number, as $c_n = 0 + 2 = 2$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the VAF formula:\n$$\n\\text{VAF} = \\frac{(0.6) \\cdot (2) + (1 - 0.6) \\cdot (0)}{(0.6) \\cdot (2) + (1 - 0.6) \\cdot (2)}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{VAF} = \\frac{1.2 + 0}{1.2 + (0.4) \\cdot (2)}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{VAF} = \\frac{1.2}{1.2 + 0.8}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{VAF} = \\frac{1.2}{2.0}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{VAF} = 0.6\n$$\n\nThe computed expected VAF for this scenario is $0.6$.\n\nInterpretation of the result:\nThe calculated VAF of $0.6$ is exactly equal to the tumor purity, $p$. This outcome is characteristic of a specific genetic state within the tumor.\n1.  **Clonality**: A VAF that equals the tumor purity for a homozygous mutation in a diploid region is a strong indicator that the mutation is clonal. A clonal event is one that occurred early in the tumor's development and is consequently present in all tumor cells of the population being sampled. If the mutation were subclonal (i.e., present in only a fraction, $\\alpha < 1$, of the tumor cells), the expected VAF would be reduced to $\\text{VAF} = \\alpha \\cdot p = \\alpha \\cdot 0.6$, which would be less than $0.6$. The observation that $\\text{VAF} = p$ implies that the clonality fraction $\\alpha$ is equal to $1$.\n2.  **Biallelic Inactivation**: The problem describes a tumor suppressor gene. According to the Knudson two-hit hypothesis, tumor suppressor genes typically require the inactivation of both alleles (\"biallelic inactivation\") to lose their function and contribute to carcinogenesis. The finding of a homozygous mutation (achieved via copy-neutral LOH in this case) confirms that both alleles of the gene are altered in the tumor cells. The copy-neutral LOH event represents the \"second hit\" that eliminated the remaining functional wild-type allele, leaving the cell with two non-functional, mutated copies. The VAF of $0.6$ provides quantitative evidence from sequencing data that this clonal, biallelic inactivation event has occurred throughout the entire tumor cell population within the sample.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6}\n$$", "id": "4365289"}, {"introduction": "Building on the analysis of allele frequencies, this practice tackles the inverse problem for copy number alterations, a hallmark of many cancers. You will learn to 'deconvolve' a mixed signal from a tumor sample to determine the true copy number of a key oncogene within the cancer cells themselves [@problem_id:4365287].

Pathology review and computational deconvolution estimate tumor purity (the cancer cell fraction) to be $0.7$. Assume the following well-tested and standard principles for copy-number calling in mixed tumor-normal samples:\n- Local sequencing depth is proportional to local DNA copy number.\n- The observed signal in a mixed sample arises as a linear combination of tumor and normal cell contributions, weighted by tumor purity.\n- The log base two ratio reported by the segmentation is defined relative to a matched diploid normal control, so that a purely diploid locus has a log base two ratio of $0$.\n- The normal cell copy number at autosomal loci is $2$.\n\nUsing only these principles, derive an expression for the tumor absolute copy number at the ERBB2 locus, denoted $C_{t}$, in terms of the reported log base two ratio $L$ and tumor purity $p$, and then evaluate it at $L=1.5$ and $p=0.7$.
