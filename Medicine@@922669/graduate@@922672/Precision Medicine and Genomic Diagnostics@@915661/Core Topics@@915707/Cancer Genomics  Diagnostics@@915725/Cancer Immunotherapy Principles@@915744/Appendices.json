In a mixed sample of tumor and normal cells, we can model the expected $\\text{VAF}$ by considering the contributions from each cell population. We assume that the number of reads generated from a locus in a cell population is proportional to the fraction of that population in the sample and the total copy number of the locus in that population.\n\nLet $N_m$ be the expected contribution of mutated alleles to the read pool and $N_{Total}$ be the expected contribution of all alleles (mutated and wild-type) at that locus. The $\\text{VAF}$ is then given by:\n$$ \\text{VAF} = \\frac{N_m}{N_{Total}} $$\n\nThe numerator, $N_m$, represents the reads from the mutated allele. The mutation exists only in the cancer cells. The fraction of cancer cells in the sample is the purity, $p$. Among these cancer cells, only a fraction, $\\text{CCF}$, actually harbor the mutation. The number of copies of the mutated allele in these specific cancer cells is the multiplicity, $m$. Therefore, the contribution of mutated alleles is proportional to the product of these factors:\n$$ N_m \\propto p \\cdot \\text{CCF} \\cdot m $$\n\nThe denominator, $N_{Total}$, represents reads from all alleles at the locus, originating from both tumor and normal cells.\nThe contribution from the entire tumor cell population (fraction $p$) is proportional to $p \\cdot C$, where $C$ is the total copy number of the locus in tumor cells.\nThe contribution from the normal cell population (fraction $1-p$) is proportional to $(1-p) \\cdot n_N$, where $n_N$ is the total copy number in normal cells. The problem states that normal cells are diploid, so $n_N = 2$.\nThus, the total contribution is:\n$$ N_{Total} \\propto p \\cdot C + (1-p) \\cdot 2 $$\n\nCombining these, we get the expression for $\\text{VAF}$:\n$$ \\text{VAF}_i = \\frac{p \\cdot \\text{CCF}_i \\cdot m_i}{p \\cdot C_i + (1-p) \\cdot 2} $$\nwhere the index $i$ corresponds to a specific mutation $M_i$.\n\nTo find the $\\text{CCF}_i$, we rearrange this equation:\n$$ \\text{CCF}_i = \\frac{\\text{VAF}_i \\cdot (p \\cdot C_i + 2(1-p))}{p \\cdot m_i} $$\nThis is the general formula we will use for our calculations.\n\nThe problem provides the purity $p=0.7$.

A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the receptor occupancy fraction, $f$, and calculate its value. The occupancy fraction is defined as the ratio of the ligand-bound HLA complex to the total concentration of HLA molecules:\n\n$$f = \\frac{[HL]}{[H]_{T}}$$\n\nThe total HLA concentration, $[H]_{T}$, is the sum of the free HLA concentration, $[H]$, and the bound HLA concentration, $[HL]$:\n\n$$[H]_{T} = [H] + [HL]$$\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $f$ gives:\n\n$$f = \\frac{[HL]}{[H] + [HL]}$$\n\nTo express $f$ in terms of the measurable or known quantities $[L]$ and $K_{D}$, we must eliminate $[H]$ and $[HL]$ from the ratio. We can use the definition of the dissociation constant, $K_{D}$:\n\n$$K_{D} = \\frac{[H][L]}{[HL]}$$\n\nFrom this definition, we can express the concentration of free HLA, $[H]$, in terms of the other species:\n\n$$[H] = K_{D} \\frac{[HL]}{[L]}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[H]$ back into the equation for $f$:\n\n$$f = \\frac{[HL]}{ \\left( K_{D} \\frac{[HL]}{[L]} \\right) + [HL] }$$\n\nAssuming the peptide concentration $[L]$ is non-zero, the concentration of the complex $[HL]$ will also be non-zero. We can therefore factor $[HL]$ from the denominator and cancel it with the numerator:\n\n$$f = \\frac{[HL]}{ [HL] \\left( \\frac{K_{D}}{[L]} + 1 \\right) } = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{D}}{[L]} + 1}$$\n\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[L]$:\n\n$$f = \\frac{1 \\cdot [L]}{ \\left( \\frac{K_{D}}{[L]} + 1 \\right) \\cdot [L] } = \\frac{[L]}{K_{D} + [L]}$$\n\nThis expression, known as the Hill-Langmuir equation for a $1:1$ binding site model, gives the receptor occupancy fraction $f$ as a function of free ligand concentration $[L]$ and the dissociation constant $K_{D}$.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n-   Peptide concentration, which under the stated approximation is the free peptide concentration: $[L] = 100\\,\\text{nM}$.\n-   Dissociation constant: $K_{D} = 50\\,\\text{nM}$.\n\nWe can now compute the numerical value of $f$ by substituting these values into the derived equation. The units of concentration ($\\text{nM}$) will cancel, yielding a dimensionless fraction, as expected.\n\n$$f = \\frac{100\\,\\text{nM}}{50\\,\\text{nM} + 100\\,\\text{nM}} = \\frac{100\\,\\text{nM}}{150\\,\\text{nM}}$$\n\n$$f = \\frac{100}{150}$$\n\nReducing the fraction to its simplest form:\n\n$$f = \\frac{10}{15} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 5}{3 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nThus, the predicted receptor occupancy fraction for the given neoantigen peptide is $\\frac{2}{3}$.

The validation process confirms that the problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\nLet us begin from the fundamental principles provided. The activation propensity, denoted as $A$, is assumed to be directly proportional to the equilibrium number of receptor–ligand bonds, $[RL]$. We can write this as $A = k[RL]$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nThe formation of receptor-ligand complexes is governed by the law of mass action. The equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined as:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}\n$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptors, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligands, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of receptor-ligand complexes.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors on the T cell surface, $[R]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of free and bound receptors:\n$$\n[R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [RL]\n$$\nBy rearranging the definition of $K_D$, we can express the free receptor concentration as $[R] = \\frac{K_D [RL]}{[L]}$.

The fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is given by $\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}}$. From the Langmuir isotherm, this is $\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_D + [L]}$. The condition of low occupancy, $\\theta \\ll 1$, implies that the free ligand concentration is much smaller than the dissociation constant, i.e., $[L] \\ll K_D$.\n\nUnder this approximation, the denominator of the Langmuir isotherm can be simplified: $K_D + [L] \\approx K_D$.
