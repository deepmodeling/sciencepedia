We shall proceed by first deriving the general mathematical relationship between the observed variant allele fraction ($v$), tumor purity ($p$), mutation multiplicity ($m$), and cancer cell fraction ($\\text{CCF}$).\n\nLet the sample be a mixture of tumor cells and normal cells. The fraction of tumor cells is the purity, $p$, and the fraction of normal cells is $1-p$.\nLet us consider a specific genomic locus. The problem states that both normal cells and tumor cells are diploid at this locus, meaning each cell contains $2$ copies of the chromosome region.\n\nThe total number of alleles at this locus in a representative sample of cells is the sum of alleles from normal and tumor cells. For a sample of $N$ total cells, there are $p N$ tumor cells and $(1-p)N$ normal cells.\nTotal alleles from normal cells = $(1-p)N \\times 2$.\nTotal alleles from tumor cells = $p N \\times 2$.\nThe total number of alleles in the sample is the sum: $2(1-p)N + 2pN = 2N(1-p+p) = 2N$.\n\nThe number of mutant alleles is determined by the properties of the tumor cell population. Normal cells do not carry the somatic mutation. Within the tumor cell population, a fraction denoted by $\\text{CCF}$ carries the mutation. The number of mutated tumor cells is $\\text{CCF} \\times pN$.\nEach of these mutated tumor cells carries the mutation on $m$ chromosomal copies, where $m$ is the mutation multiplicity.\nThe total number of mutant alleles in the sample is therefore: $(\\text{CCF} \\cdot pN) \\times m$.\n\nThe variant allele fraction ($v$) is defined as the ratio of the number of mutant alleles to the total number of alleles.\n$$v = \\frac{\\text{Number of mutant alleles}}{\\text{Total number of alleles}} = \\frac{\\text{CCF} \\cdot p \\cdot N \\cdot m}{2N}$$\nThe total number of cells $N$ cancels, yielding the fundamental relationship:\n$$v = \\frac{\\text{CCF} \\cdot p \\cdot m}{2}$$\nTo estimate the cancer cell fraction, we rearrange this equation:\n$$\\text{CCF} = \\frac{2v}{p \\cdot m}$$\nThe problem provides the following values: tumor purity $p=0.60$, $v_{\\text{PIK3CA}}=0.20$, and $v_{\\text{EGFR}}=0.40$. The multiplicity $m$ must be the smallest integer from the set $\\{1, 2\\}$ that results in a biologically admissible cancer cell fraction, i.e., $\\text{CCF} \\in [0, 1]$.\n\n**Analysis of the PIK3CA E545K mutation:**\nThe observed VAF is $v_{\\text{PIK3CA}} = 0.20$. The purity is $p=0.60$.\nWe test the possible values for $m$ starting with the smallest.\n\nCase 1: $m=1$ (heterozygous mutation).\n$$\\text{CCF}_{\\text{PIK3CA}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot v_{\\text{PIK3CA}}}{p \\cdot m} = \\frac{2 \\cdot (0.20)}{0.60 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{0.40}{0.60} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nThe value $\\frac{2}{3}$ is within the admissible range $[0, 1]$. Since we must choose the smallest integer $m$ that provides an admissible $\\text{CCF}$, we select $m=1$.\nTherefore, the estimated cancer cell fraction for the PIK3CA mutation is $\\text{CCF}_{\\text{PIK3CA}} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nBecause $\\text{CCF}_{\\text{PIK3CA}} < 1$, the PIK3CA mutation is subclonal; it is present in approximately $67\\%$ of the tumor cells.\n\n**Analysis of the EGFR L858R mutation:**\nThe observed VAF is $v_{\\text{EGFR}} = 0.40$. The purity is $p=0.60$.\nWe again test the possible values for $m$ starting with the smallest.\n\nCase 1: $m=1$ (heterozygous mutation).\n$$\\text{CCF}_{\\text{EGFR}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot v_{\\text{EGFR}}}{p \\cdot m} = \\frac{2 \\cdot (0.40)}{0.60 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{0.80}{0.60} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\nThe value $\\frac{4}{3}$ is greater than $1$, which is biologically impossible. A cancer cell fraction cannot exceed $100\\%$. Thus, $m=1$ is not a valid multiplicity for this mutation under the given model.\n\nCase 2: $m=2$ (e.g., homozygous mutation or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity).\nWe proceed to test the next integer value for multiplicity, $m=2$.\n$$\\text{CCF}_{\\text{EGFR}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot v_{\\text{EGFR}}}{p \\cdot m} = \\frac{2 \\cdot (0.40)}{0.60 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{0.80}{1.20} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nThe value $\\frac{2}{3}$ is within the admissible range $[0, 1]$. As this is the smallest integer value for $m$ that yields a valid $\\text{CCF}$, we select $m=2$.\nTherefore, the estimated cancer cell fraction for the EGFR mutation is $\\text{CCF}_{\\text{EGFR}} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\nBecause $\\text{CCF}_{\\text{EGFR}} < 1$, the EGFR mutation is also subclonal, present in the same fraction of tumor cells as the PIK3CA mutation. The required multiplicity of $m=2$ implies that in the subclone harboring this mutation, the cells have two copies of the mutant allele at the EGFR locus.\n\nThe final answer requires the cancer cell fractions for PIK3CA and EGFR, in that order.\n$\\text{CCF}_{\\text{PIK3CA}} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n$\\text{CCF}_{\\text{EGFR}} = \\frac{2}{3}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{2}{3} & \\frac{2}{3}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4336272"}, {"introduction": "After identifying a therapeutic target, the next critical question is whether a drug can effectively engage it within the cell's complex molecular environment.
