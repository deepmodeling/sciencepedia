Let the actionability score be defined conceptually as the expected probability that a targeted intervention guided by the variant will produce a clinically meaningful benefit for this patient. Model the contributing components as follows: an evidence weight $W$ representing the posterior probability that the variant is a valid predictive biomarker for response in the relevant clinical context; a normalized effect size $E \\in [0,1]$ representing the probability that the therapeutic effect magnitude exceeds a minimal clinically important difference under the targeted intervention; and an assay reliability $R$ representing the probability that the laboratory result truly reflects the presence of the actionable alteration and is clinically concordant with the current disease state. Assume $W$, $E$, and $R$ are independent and interpret the actionability score $S$ as the joint probability that all three conditions obtain simultaneously.\n\nUse the following numerical inputs for a specific variant–therapy pairing evaluated in this patient: $W = 0.65$, $E = 0.55$, $R = 0.85$.\n\nDefine tier cut-offs by three boundaries $\\tau_{1} = 0.30$, $\\tau_{2} = 0.15$, and $\\tau_{3} = 0.05$.

This practice delves into the fundamental principles governing Variant Allele Fraction ($VAF$), a key metric in sequencing analysis [@problem_id:4317086]. You will derive the mathematical relationship between $VAF$, tumor purity, and copy number state, revealing why a naive interpretation of $VAF$ is insufficient and how a context-aware model is essential for robust clinical assessment.", "problem": "A bulk tissue specimen is sequenced to assess somatic variants relevant to precision oncology. The sample contains a mixture of tumor and normal cells, where the tumor cell fraction (tumor purity) is $p$. At a genomic locus with tumor copy number $CN_{t}$ and normal (diploid) copy number $CN_{n}$, a clonal heterozygous somatic variant is present on $m$ mutated copies in every tumor cell and absent in normal cells. Assume unbiased sequencing without allelic amplification bias, and that the expected read fraction equals the underlying allele fraction at the locus in the mixture.\n\nStarting from core definitions of allele counts contributed by tumor and normal compartments and the definition of variant allele fraction ($VAF$), derive the expected expression for the variant allele fraction as a function of $p$, $CN_{t}$, $CN_{n}$, and $m$. Then, compute the expected variant allele fraction for $p=0.4$, $CN_{t}=2$, $CN_{n}=2$, and $m=1$. Express the result as a decimal or a fraction (no percentage sign).\n\nFinally, reason about the implications of this expected value for actionability classification thresholds in clinical genomics pipelines that use a raw VAF threshold $\\theta$ to flag variants for potential clinical action, in light of the dependence of the expected VAF on $p$ and $CN_{t}$. No numerical result is required for this discussion. The numerical answer must be the expected variant allele fraction and must be a single real-valued number or a single closed-form expression.", "solution": "The variant allele fraction, denoted as $VAF$, is defined as the fraction of sequencing reads at a specific locus that carry the variant allele. Under the assumption that read fraction equals the underlying allele fraction, the $VAF$ can be calculated as the ratio of the total number of variant alleles to the total number of all alleles at that locus in the tissue sample.\n\nThe sample is a mixture of two populations: tumor cells, which constitute a fraction $p$ of the total cells, and normal cells, which constitute the remaining fraction $(1-p)$. We can model the total and variant allele counts by summing the contributions from each population.\n\nLet's calculate the numerator of the $VAF$ expression: the total number of variant alleles.\nThe variant is somatic, meaning it is present only in the tumor cells. Normal cells do not carry the variant. In each tumor cell, there are $m$ copies of the variant allele.\nThe contribution to variant alleles from the tumor cell fraction $p$ is proportional to $p \\cdot m$.\nThe contribution from the normal cell fraction $(1-p)$ is $0$.\nThus, the total number of variant alleles in the mixture is proportional to $p \\cdot m$.\n\nNext, let's calculate the denominator: the total number of alleles (both variant and wild-type) at the locus.\nEach tumor cell has a total copy number of $CN_{t}$ at this locus. The contribution to the total allele count from the tumor cell fraction $p$ is proportional to $p \\times CN_{t}$.\nEach normal cell is diploid, with a copy number of $CN_{n}$. The problem specifies $CN_{n}=2$. The contribution to the total allele count from the normal cell fraction $(1-p)$ is proportional to $(1-p) \\times CN_{n}$.\nThe total number of alleles in the mixture is the sum of contributions from both cell types, proportional to $p \\cdot CN_{t} + (1-p) \\cdot CN_{n}$.\n\nCombining the numerator and the denominator, we derive the general expression for the expected $VAF$:\n$$ VAF = \\frac{p \\cdot m}{p \\cdot CN_{t} + (1-p) \\cdot CN_{n}} $$\nThis is the required general formula.\n\nNow, we compute the expected $VAF$ for the specific case provided:\n-   Tumor purity $p = 0.4$\n-   Tumor copy number $CN_{t} = 2$\n-   Normal copy number $CN_{n} = 2$\n-   Mutated copies in tumor cells $m = 1$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$ VAF = \\frac{0.4 \\times 1}{(0.4 \\times 2) + (1 - 0.4) \\times 2} $$\n$$ VAF = \\frac{0.4}{0.8 + (0.6) \\times 2} $$\n$$ VAF = \\frac{0.4}{0.8 + 1.2} $$\n$$ VAF = \\frac{0.4}{2.0} $$\n$$ VAF = 0.2 $$\n\nThe expected variant allele fraction for this case is $0.2$, or $\\frac{1}{5}$.\n\nFinally, we reason about the implications of this model for clinical genomics pipelines. The derived formula, $VAF = \\frac{p \\cdot m}{p \\cdot CN_{t} + (1-p) \\cdot CN_{n}}$, demonstrates that the expected $VAF$ of a clonal somatic variant is not a fixed constant. Instead, it is a function of both the tumor purity ($p$) and the locus-specific copy number in the tumor ($CN_{t}$) and normal tissue ($CN_{n}$).\n\nA clinical genomics pipeline that uses a simple, fixed $VAF$ threshold, $\\theta$, to identify potentially actionable variants is fundamentally flawed.\n1.  **False Negatives**: A sample with low tumor purity ($p$) will exhibit a proportionally lower $VAF$ for a clonal variant. For instance, in a copy-neutral region ($CN_{t}=CN_{n}=2$), the expected $VAF$ for a clonal heterozygous mutation ($m=1$) simplifies to $VAF = p/2$. If a pipeline uses a threshold of $\\theta = 0.05$, a true clonal driver mutation in a sample with $p=0.08$ would have an expected $VAF$ of $0.04$ and would be missed. This is a critical issue as many clinical specimens have low to moderate purity.\n2.  **Misinterpretation of Clonality**: The $VAF$ is also modulated by copy number alterations. A copy number loss of the wild-type allele (loss of heterozygosity, LOH) in tumor cells can elevate the $VAF$. For example, if $p=0.4$, $CN_{n}=2$, but the tumor has LOH such that $CN_{t}=1$ and $m=1$, the expected $VAF$ becomes $VAF = \\frac{0.4 \\times 1}{(0.4 \\times 1) + (0.6 \\times 2)} = \\frac{0.4}{0.4 + 1.2} = \\frac{0.4}{1.6} = 0.25$. This value is significantly higher than the $0.2$ calculated for the copy-neutral state. Conversely, copy number gains can also alter the expected $VAF$.\n\nTherefore, interpreting an observed $VAF$ value in isolation is insufficient and can be misleading. A robust actionability assessment requires integrating information from multiple sources. An advanced pipeline should first estimate the global tumor purity $p$ (e.g., from the full distribution of somatic variant VAFs) and the locus-specific copy number $CN_{t}$ (from sequencing read depth). With these estimates, the pipeline can calculate the *expected* $VAF$ for a clonal variant at any given genomic locus. The observed $VAF$ can then be compared to this context-specific expectation to more accurately determine the variant's clonality (clonal vs. subclonal) and to avoid incorrectly filtering out true positive variants in low-purity or copy-altered samples. Reliance on a raw, fixed $VAF$ threshold $\\theta$ compromises the sensitivity and specificity of somatic variant detection and classification.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2}$$", "id": "4317086"}, {"introduction": "In clinical diagnostics, not all measurements are made with equal certainty, especially for variants detected at very low frequencies.
