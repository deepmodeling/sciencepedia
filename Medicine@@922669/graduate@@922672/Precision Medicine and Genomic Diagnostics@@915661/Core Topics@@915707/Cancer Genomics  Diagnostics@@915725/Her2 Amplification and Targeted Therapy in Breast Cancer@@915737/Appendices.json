It is based on established principles of genomic diagnostics and clinical oncology, specifically the use of Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) status assessment in breast cancer. The provided data are sufficient and plausible for a definitive analysis based on real-world clinical guidelines. Thus, the problem is valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe core principle of dual-probe FISH for gene amplification is to normalize the copy number of the gene of interest against a reference point on the same chromosome. This corrects for aneuploidy (an abnormal number of chromosomes), which is common in cancer cells. In this case, the `HER2` gene, located on chromosome $17$, is the gene of interest. The Centromere Enumeration Probe 17 (CEP17) targets the centromeric region of chromosome $17$ and serves as the reference, representing the chromosome's copy number.\n\nThe two key parameters provided are:\n1. The mean HER2 signal count per nucleus, which we will denote as $\\bar{N}_{HER2}$.\n2. The mean CEP17 signal count per nucleus, which we will denote as $\\bar{N}_{CEP17}$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the given values are:\n$$ \\bar{N}_{HER2} = 14 $$\n$$ \\bar{N}_{CEP17} = 5 $$\n\nThe HER2/CEP17 ratio, hereafter designated as $R$, is calculated by dividing the mean HER2 signal count by the mean CEP17 signal count. This ratio quantifies gene amplification relative to the chromosome copy number.\n\nThe formula for the ratio is:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\bar{N}_{HER2}}{\\bar{N}_{CEP17}} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$ R = \\frac{14}{5} $$\n$$ R = 2.8 $$\n\nThe problem requires the ratio to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. The exact value of the calculation is $2.8$. To express this with three significant figures, we include a trailing zero.\n$$ R_{rounded} = 2.80 $$\n\nTo determine the case's category (amplified vs. not amplified), we must apply the consensus interpretive criteria from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP). According to the 2018 ASCO/CAP guidelines for HER2 testing, a breast cancer case is considered positive for HER2 amplification (i.e., \"amplified\") if the following conditions are met from a dual-probe FISH assay:\nThe HER2/CEP17 ratio is $\\ge 2.0$, and the average HER2 copy number per cell is $\\ge 4.0$.\n\nLet's evaluate the current case against these criteria:\n1. The calculated HER2/CEP17 ratio is $R = 2.8$. This value satisfies the condition $R \\ge 2.0$.\n2. The provided mean HER2 signal count is $\\bar{N}_{HER2} = 14$. This value satisfies the condition $\\bar{N}_{HER2} \\ge 4.0$.\n\nSince both criteria are unequivocally met, the case is categorized as HER2 positive, meaning the HER2 gene is amplified.

The reaction can be written as:\n$$\nR + A \\rightleftharpoons RA\n$$\nAccording to the Law of Mass Action, at equilibrium, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal. The equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined as the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the free reactants to the concentration of the complex. Based on the problem's definition (\"the ratio of free species concentrations to complex concentration\"), we have:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{[R][A]}{[RA]}\n$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptor, $[A]$ is the concentration of free antibody, and $[RA]$ is the concentration of the receptor-antibody complex.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R_{\\text{total}}]$, is the sum of the free receptors and the bound receptors.
