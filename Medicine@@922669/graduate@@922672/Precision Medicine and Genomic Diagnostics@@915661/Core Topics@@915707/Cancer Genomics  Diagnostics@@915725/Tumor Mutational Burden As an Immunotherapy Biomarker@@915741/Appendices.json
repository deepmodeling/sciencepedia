This frequency depends on the mixture of tumor and normal cells in the sample.\n\nLet $p$ be the tumor purity, representing the fraction of cancer cells in the sample. The fraction of normal cells is then $1-p$. We assume all cells are diploid.\nA single cancer cell has $2$ alleles at any given locus. A single normal cell also has $2$ alleles. The total pool of alleles in the sample is derived from a fraction $p$ of tumor cells and $1-p$ of normal cells. Thus, the total number of alleles is proportional to $2p + 2(1-p) = 2$.\n\nThe somatic mutation is heterozygous and present in a subclonal fraction $c$ of the cancer cells. This means that a fraction $c$ of the tumor cells contains one mutant allele and one wild-type allele. The remaining fraction $1-c$ of tumor cells and all normal cells contain two wild-type alleles.\n\nThe number of mutant alleles is contributed only by the subclonal fraction of tumor cells. The number of mutant alleles is proportional to $p \\times c \\times 1$.\nThe total number of alleles is proportional to $2$.\n\nThe expected VAF, $v$, is the ratio of the number of mutant alleles to the total number of alleles:\n$$v(p,c) = \\frac{\\text{mutant alleles}}{\\text{total alleles}} = \\frac{p \\cdot c \\cdot 1}{p \\cdot 2 + (1-p) \\cdot 2} = \\frac{pc}{2}$$\nFor the given parameters, $p=0.30$, so the expected VAF for a mutation with subclonal fraction $c$ is $v(c) = \\frac{0.30c}{2} = 0.15c$.\n\n**Task 2: Derive the detection probability for a single mutation**\n\nA mutation is called if the number of alternate reads, $X$, is at least $k$, and the observed VAF is at least $t$.
