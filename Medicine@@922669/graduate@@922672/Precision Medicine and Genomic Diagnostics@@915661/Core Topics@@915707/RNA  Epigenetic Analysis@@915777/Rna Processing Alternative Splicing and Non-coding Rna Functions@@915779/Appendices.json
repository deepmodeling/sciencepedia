Consider a single binding site model in which U2AF65 ($L$) binds a polypyrimidine site ($S$) to form the complex ($SL$) at thermodynamic equilibrium governed by the law of mass action. The dissociation constant is defined as $K_{d} = \\frac{[S][L]}{[SL]}$, and the site conservation is $[S]_{\\text{tot}} = [S] + [SL]$. Under nuclear conditions where the ligand is in excess relative to sites, assume $[L]$ in the binding equation equals the measured nuclear free concentration.\n\nA clinically observed sequence variant in the polypyrimidine tract increases U2AF65 binding affinity, changing the dissociation constant from $K_{d} = 100$ nM (reference) to $K_{d} = 50$ nM (variant). The nuclear free concentration of U2AF65 is $[L] = 100$ nM in both cases, and all other assembly factors (for example, splicing factor $1$ (SF1), the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U2 snRNP), and the U2 auxiliary factor, $35$-kilodalton subunit (U2AF1, commonly U2AF35)) are non-limiting so that the probability (or steady-state rate) of A complex formation is directly proportional to the occupancy of U2AF65 on the polypyrimidine site.\n\nStarting only from the mass action definition of $K_{d}$ and site conservation, derive the expression for the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ as a function of $K_{d}$ and $[L]$, then evaluate $\\theta$ for the variant ($K_{d} = 50$ nM) and for the reference ($K_{d} = 100$ nM) at $[L] = 100$ nM.

This indicates a substantial reduction in the predicted strength of the $5^{\\prime}$ splice donor site due to the variant.\nIn the context of pre-mRNA splicing, the $5^{\\prime}$ splice site sequence is recognized and bound by the U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), a component of the U1 snRNP. The MaxEntScan score is a proxy for the information content of the site and is correlated with U1 binding affinity. A large decrease in the score strongly suggests that the variant significantly weakens the binding of the U1 snRNP to the donor site.\nThis impaired recognition by the splicing machinery can lead to several alternative splicing outcomes, such as:\n1. Exon skipping, where the exon upstream of the weakened site is excluded from the final mRNA.\n2. Use of a nearby cryptic splice site, leading to an altered mRNA sequence.\n3. Intron retention, where the intron is not removed.\nAny of these outcomes can result in a frameshift or the introduction of a premature termination codon, leading to the production of a truncated or non-functional protein, or degradation of the transcript via nonsense-mediated decay (NMD).\nIn a precision diagnostics context, a variant causing such a dramatic drop in a splice site score is considered strong evidence of pathogenicity. It provides a clear, quantitative mechanistic hypothesis for how the genetic change leads to disease, justifying its prioritization for functional studies and its potential use in clinical decision-making.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-5.070}\n$$", "id": "4378203"}]}
