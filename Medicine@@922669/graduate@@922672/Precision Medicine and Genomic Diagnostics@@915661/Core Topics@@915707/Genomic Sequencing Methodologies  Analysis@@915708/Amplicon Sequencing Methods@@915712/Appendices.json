To obtain a specific value for $\\mu$, we should choose the largest possible $\\mu$ that satisfies this condition, as a larger amplicon can provide more sequence information.

To work with this probability, we standardize the variable. Let $Z$ be a standard normal random variable, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. The standardization is $Z = \\frac{I - \\mu}{\\sigma}$.\nThe inequality $I \\leq 2R$ can be rewritten in terms of $Z$:\n$$ \\frac{I - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\leq \\frac{2R - \\mu}{\\sigma} $$\nSo, the probability statement becomes:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z \\leq \\frac{2R - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) = 0.99 $$\nThis is equivalent to stating that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, $\\Phi(\\cdot)$, evaluated at $\\frac{2R - \\mu}{\\sigma}$, is equal to $0.99$.\n$$ \\Phi\\left(\\frac{2R - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) = 0.99 $$\nLet $z_{0.99}$ be the $99^{th}$ percentile of the standard normal distribution, i.e., the value such that $\\Phi(z_{0.99}) = 0.99$.
