The normal compartment is diploid at the locus with total copy number $2$ and carries no mutated copies (that is, the SNV is absent from normal cells).

It presents a standard theoretical model used in cancer genomics to relate key biological and sample parameters to an observable sequencing metric. The givens are self-contained and sufficient for deriving a unique, meaningful solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe expected Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) is defined as the ratio of the expected number of sequencing reads carrying the variant allele to the expected total number of sequencing reads covering that specific genomic locus. Under the assumption that the expected number of reads from a particular DNA segment is directly proportional to the number of copies of that segment in the sample, we can express the VAF in terms of the number of DNA molecules.\n\nLet $N_{mut}$ be the total number of mutated alleles at the locus in the sample, and let $N_{total}$ be the total number of all alleles (mutated and wild-type) at the same locus. The expected VAF is then:\n$$ \\text{VAF} = \\frac{N_{mut}}{N_{total}} $$\n\nThe sample is a mixture of two cell populations: tumor cells and normal cells. Let's calculate the contribution of each population to $N_{mut}$ and $N_{total}$. We can consider a representative sample containing a total of $N$ cells.\n\nThe number of tumor cells in the sample is $p N$.\nThe number of normal cells in the sample is $(1-p) N$.\n\nContribution from tumor cells:\nThe problem states that each tumor cell has $C_{mut}$ copies of the mutated allele and a total copy number of $C_{tot}$ at the locus.\nThe total number of mutated alleles from the tumor cell population is:\n$$ N_{mut, tumor} = (\\text{Number of tumor cells}) \\times (\\text{Mutated copies per tumor cell}) = (p N) \\cdot C_{mut} $$\nThe total number of all alleles (mutated and wild-type) from the tumor cell population is:\n$$ N_{total, tumor} = (\\text{Number of tumor cells}) \\times (\\text{Total copies per tumor cell}) = (p N) \\cdot C_{tot} $$\n\nContribution from normal cells:\nThe problem states that normal cells are diploid at the locus, meaning they have a total copy number of $2$, and they carry no mutated copies (the variant is somatic).\nThe total number of mutated alleles from the normal cell population is:\n$$ N_{mut, normal} = (\\text{Number of normal cells}) \\times (\\text{Mutated copies per normal cell}) = ((1-p) N) \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\nThe total number of all alleles from the normal cell population is:\n$$ N_{total, normal} = (\\text{Number of normal cells}) \\times (\\text{Total copies per normal cell}) = ((1-p) N) \\cdot 2 $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of mutated alleles, $N_{mut}$, and the total number of all alleles, $N_{total}$, in the entire sample by summing the contributions from both populations.\n\nTotal number of mutated alleles in the sample:\n$$ N_{mut} = N_{mut, tumor} + N_{mut, normal} = p N C_{mut} + 0 = p N C_{mut} $$\n\nTotal number of all alleles in the sample:\n$$ N_{total} = N_{total, tumor} + N_{total, normal} = p N C_{tot} + 2 N (1-p) $$\n\nFinally, we can compute the expected VAF by taking the ratio of $N_{mut}$ to $N_{total}$:\n$$ \\text{VAF} = \\frac{N_{mut}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{p N C_{mut}}{p N C_{tot} + 2 N (1-p)} $$\nThe total number of cells, $N$, is a common factor in the numerator and denominator, and thus cancels out:\n$$ \\text{VAF} = \\frac{p C_{mut}}{p C_{tot} + 2(1-p)} $$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the expected VAF.\n\nFor this expression to be valid in practice within precision medicine and genomic diagnostics, several minimal assumptions must hold:\n$1$. **Clonality and Homogeneity**: The somatic variant must be clonal, meaning it is present in $100\\%$ of the tumor cells. Furthermore, the copy number state described by $C_{tot}$ and $C_{mut}$ must be homogeneous across the entire tumor cell population. The model does not account for subclonal heterogeneity.\n$2$. **Accurate Parameter Estimation**: The values for tumor purity ($p$), tumor-specific total copy number ($C_{tot}$), and the number of mutated copies in the tumor ($C_{mut}$) must be known with high accuracy. Errors in these input parameters will directly propagate to errors in the predicted VAF.\n$3$. **Diploid and Normal Germline**: The non-tumor cell compartment must be composed of diploid cells (copy number $2$) that do not carry the somatic mutation. This assumption can be violated in patients with constitutional copy number variants or germline mosaicism.\n$4$. **Absence of Systemic Bias**: The entire process, from sample collection to data analysis, must be free of systemic bias. This includes no preferential amplification of either the mutant or wild-type allele during library preparation (e.g., PCR bias) and no mapping bias where reads from one allele align to the reference genome more or less efficiently than reads from the other allele.

This is a direct application of the mixture model stated in the problem and respects the Binomial sampling process. As demonstrated by the calculation, incorporating $f$ prevents the model from incorrectly penalizing somatic variants with low-level alternate reads in the normal due to contamination, thereby reducing false negatives. Estimating $f$ jointly across many sites (for example, using clonal somatic SNVs, high-confidence tumor-specific markers, or through hierarchical Bayesian modeling) is principled and improves robustness. Verdict — Correct.\n\nOption B: This suggests raising a fixed normal alternate-read threshold while maintaining $q_N = 0$ under the somatic model. This is not principled because it does not model the data-generating process; it treats contamination-induced alternate reads as exempt up to an arbitrary constant regardless of depth $n_N$, which violates the Binomial sampling rationale where evidence scales with $n_N$. It can either let true germline variants pass at high coverage or still reject true somatic variants at low coverage, and does not provide calibrated likelihoods or posteriors. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption C: Inflating $p_T$ to absorb tumor-in-normal contamination conflates two distinct mixture processes: $p_T$ governs the tumor sample, while $f$ governs the normal sample. Changing $p_T$ cannot correct the normal sample likelihood because $q_N$ under the somatic hypothesis remains improperly set to $0$; as a result, any nonzero $k_N$ must be ascribed to error, leading to miscalibration. Moreover, misestimating $p_T$ biases the tumor-side likelihood and downstream variant allele fraction interpretation. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption D: Discarding the matched normal removes direct evidence of germline variation and of contamination structure, generally degrading both precision and recall in somatic calling, especially for private germline variants absent from population databases. It does not mitigate tumor-in-normal contamination; rather, it abandons the opportunity to model it. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the single best option is Option A, which matches the first-principles mixture and sampling framework and provides a calibrated, model-based mitigation strategy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4384658"}]}
