Using ROC analysis and first principles definitions of sensitivity and specificity, which threshold best balances sensitivity and specificity for the intended clinical use while meeting the pre-specified minima?\n\nA. Choose $\\tau=0.45$.\n\nB. Choose $\\tau=0.60$.\n\nC. Choose $\\tau=0.30$.\n\nD. Choose $\\tau=0.75$.", "solution": "To determine the optimal threshold, we must first calculate the analytical sensitivity and specificity for each candidate threshold and then assess which one meets the minimum performance criteria and provides the best balance.\n\n**Definitions:**\n-   **Analytical Sensitivity (True Positive Rate)**: The ability of the test to correctly identify true positives.\n    $$ \\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} $$\n-   **Analytical Specificity (True Negative Rate)**: The ability of the test to correctly identify true negatives.\n    $$ \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP} $$\n\nThe validation set contains $100$ true positives ($TP+FN=100$) and $100$ true negatives ($TN+FP=100$).\n\n**Performance Calculations for Each Threshold:**\n\n1.  **For $\\tau=0.30$**:\n    -   Sensitivity = $\\frac{96}{96+4} = \\frac{96}{100} = 0.96$\n    -   Specificity = $\\frac{78}{22+78} = \\frac{78}{100} = 0.78$\n\n2.  **For $\\tau=0.45$**:\n    -   Sensitivity = $\\frac{92}{92+8} = \\frac{92}{100} = 0.92$\n    -   Specificity = $\\frac{88}{12+88} = \\frac{88}{100} = 0.88$\n\n3.  **For $\\tau=0.60$**:\n    -   Sensitivity = $\\frac{86}{86+14} = \\frac{86}{100} = 0.86$\n    -   Specificity = $\\frac{93}{7+93} = \\frac{93}{100} = 0.93$\n\n4.  **For $\\tau=0.75$**:\n    -   Sensitivity = $\\frac{79}{79+21} = \\frac{79}{100} = 0.79$\n    -   Specificity = $\\frac{97}{3+97} = \\frac{97}{100} = 0.97$\n\n**Evaluation Against Criteria:**\n\nThe laboratory has pre-specified that both sensitivity and specificity must be at least $0.85$.\n\n-   **$\\tau=0.30$**: Fails because Specificity ($0.78$) is less than $0.85$.\n-   **$\\tau=0.45$**: Passes, as both Sensitivity ($0.92$) and Specificity ($0.88$) are greater than $0.85$.\n-   **$\\tau=0.60$**: Passes, as both Sensitivity ($0.86$) and Specificity ($0.93$) are greater than $0.85$.\n-   **$\\tau=0.75$**: Fails because Sensitivity ($0.79$) is less than $0.85$.\n\nWe are left with two valid candidates: $\\tau=0.45$ and $\\tau=0.60$. The question asks for the threshold that \"best balances\" sensitivity and specificity. We can assess this by looking at how close the two metrics are to each other, or by using a summary metric like Youden's J index ($J = \\text{Sensitivity} + \\text{Specificity} - 1$), which measures the vertical distance from the chance line in an ROC curve.\n\n-   **For $\\tau=0.45$**:\n    -   $J = 0.92 + 0.88 - 1 = 0.80$.\n    -   The absolute difference is $|0.92 - 0.88| = 0.04$.\n\n-   **For $\\tau=0.60$**:\n    -   $J = 0.86 + 0.93 - 1 = 0.79$.\n    -   The absolute difference is $|0.86 - 0.93| = 0.07$.\n\nComparing the two valid thresholds, $\\tau=0.45$ has a higher Youden's J index, indicating better overall diagnostic performance. The sensitivity and specificity values are also more closely balanced. Therefore, $\\tau=0.45$ is the best choice among the options that meet the minimum requirements.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4389453"}]}
