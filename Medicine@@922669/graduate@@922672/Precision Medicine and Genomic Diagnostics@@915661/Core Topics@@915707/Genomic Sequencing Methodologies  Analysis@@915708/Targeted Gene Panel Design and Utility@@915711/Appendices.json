A recurring challenge is avoiding cross-capture of highly similar pseudogenes. Consider a single bait sequence of length $k$ nucleotides that must hybridize uniquely to its intended locus in the human genome under conditions that effectively require an exact match over the $k$-mer for efficient capture.\n\nAssume the following foundational facts and use them to derive a conservative minimal $k$:\n- By definition, a $k$-mer is a contiguous sequence of $k$ nucleotides. A bait of length $k$ captures any genomic locus containing an exact match to its $k$-mer on either strand (forward or reverse complement).\n- Let the human genome length be $S = 3.1 \\times 10^9$ nucleotides. For a conservative bound on off-target matches anywhere in the genome (excluding the intended locus), assume the genome is a long sequence of independent draws from a stationary nucleotide distribution with frequencies $f_{\\mathrm{A}} = 0.30$, $f_{\\mathrm{T}} = 0.30$, $f_{\\mathrm{C}} = 0.20$, $f_{\\mathrm{G}} = 0.20$. For a worst-case bait composition, the per-base match probability is upper bounded by $f_{\\max} = \\max\\{f_{\\mathrm{A}}, f_{\\mathrm{T}}, f_{\\mathrm{C}}, f_{\\mathrm{G}}\\} = 0.30$, so the probability that a random position matches the bait $k$-mer exactly is at most $(f_{\\max})^{k}$. Because either strand can match, the effective number of independent locations to check is doubled.\n- The acceptable upper bound on the total probability of any off-target exact match (either anywhere in the genome or within known pseudogenes) is $\\alpha = 10^{-6}$. To guarantee this using the union bound, enforce separate bounds for genome-wide background and pseudogenes: the background off-target probability must be at most $\\alpha/2$, and the pseudogene off-target probability must be at most $\\alpha/2$.\n- From curated gene-pseudogene alignments near the intended bait locus, the longest contiguous run of full identity between the target gene and each of its $J = 4$ pseudogenes is observed to be $R_1 = 28$, $R_2 = 35$, $R_3 = 26$, and $R_4 = 31$ nucleotides.

This length must satisfy two distinct constraints simultaneously: one related to avoiding random off-target matches across the entire genome, and another related to avoiding matches with known pseudogenes.

It is well-posed, objective, and provides a complete and consistent set of data for a simplified but standard model of probe design. The problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution, addressing the tasks in order.\n\n1.  Minimal $k$ for the Genome-Wide Background Constraint\n\nThe problem defines a conservative model for genome-wide off-target matches. The probability of an exact match to a specific $k$-mer at any random position in the genome is at most $(f_{\\max})^k$. The human genome has a length of $S$. A $k$-mer can start at approximately $S$ positions on the forward strand and $S$ positions on the reverse complement strand, giving a total of $2S$ possible locations for an off-target match.\n\nLet $P_{\\text{bg}}$ be the total probability of having at least one off-target match anywhere in the background genome. Using the union bound, this probability is less than or equal to the sum of the probabilities of a match at each possible starting location. For rare events, this sum is a good approximation of the probability of at least one event and is equivalent to the expected number of off-target matches, $E_{\\text{bg}}$.\n\n$$E_{\\text{bg}} = (\\text{Number of locations}) \\times (\\text{Probability of match per location})$$\nThe number of locations is $2S$. The probability of match is bounded by $(f_{\\max})^k$.\n$$E_{\\text{bg}} \\le 2S (f_{\\max})^k$$\n\nThe problem requires that the background off-target probability be at most $\\alpha/2$. We enforce this constraint on our upper bound for the expected number of matches:\n$$2S (f_{\\max})^k \\le \\frac{\\alpha}{2}$$\n\nWe now solve this inequality for the minimal integer $k$. Let this value be $k_1$.\nSubstituting the given values: $S = 3.1 \\times 10^9$, $f_{\\max} = 0.30$, and $\\alpha = 10^{-6}$.\n$$2(3.1 \\times 10^9) (0.30)^k \\le \\frac{10^{-6}}{2}$$\n$$6.2 \\times 10^9 \\times (0.30)^k \\le 0.5 \\times 10^{-6}$$\n$$(0.30)^k \\le \\frac{0.5 \\times 10^{-6}}{6.2 \\times 10^9}$$\n$$(0.30)^k \\le \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-7}}{6.2 \\times 10^9} = \\frac{5}{6.2} \\times 10^{-16} \\approx 8.0645 \\times 10^{-17}$$\n\nTo solve for $k$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. Since $\\ln(0.30)$ is negative, applying it will reverse the inequality sign when we divide.\n$$k \\ln(0.30) \\le \\ln(8.0645 \\times 10^{-17})$$\n$$k \\ge \\frac{\\ln(8.0645 \\times 10^{-17})}{\\ln(0.30)}$$\nUsing numerical values for the logarithms: $\\ln(8.0645 \\times 10^{-17}) \\approx -37.056$ and $\\ln(0.30) \\approx -1.204$.\n$$k \\ge \\frac{-37.056}{-1.204} \\approx 30.778$$\nSince $k$ must be an integer, the minimal integer value satisfying this constraint is $k_1 = 31$.\n\n2.  Minimal $k$ for the Pseudogene Constraint\n\nThe problem states that there are $J=4$ pseudogenes with known regions of high identity to the target gene. The longest contiguous runs of full identity are given as $R_1=28$, $R_2=35$, $R_3=26$, and $R_4=31$. An off-target match to a pseudogene is guaranteed if the bait $k$-mer lies entirely within one of these runs.\n\nTo design a universally applicable bait length $k$ that guarantees no such match can occur, regardless of where the bait is placed in the target gene, $k$ must be larger than the longest possible run of identity. Let $R_{\\max}$ be the maximum of these run lengths.\n$$R_{\\max} = \\max\\{R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4\\} = \\max\\{28, 35, 26, 31\\} = 35$$\nIf we choose a bait length $k$ such that $k > R_{\\max}$, then it is impossible for a bait of this length to be fully contained within any of the specified identity runs. This is a deterministic condition. The bait (a contiguous sequence of length $k$) would be longer than any available contiguous block of perfect identity with the pseudogenes.\nTherefore, the constraint on $k$ is:\n$$k > R_{\\max}$$\n$$k > 35$$\n\nThe minimal integer value for $k$, which we denote $k_2$, that satisfies this condition is $k_2 = 36$. By choosing $k \\ge 36$, the probability of an off-target match arising from these documented identity runs becomes exactly $0$. This trivially satisfies the requirement that the pseudogene off-target probability be at most $\\alpha/2 = 0.5 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\n3.  Final Minimal Bait Length\n\nThe final bait length $k$ must simultaneously satisfy both the genome-wide background constraint and the pseudogene constraint.\nFrom Task 1, we require $k \\ge k_1$, which is $k \\ge 31$.\nFrom Task 2, we require $k \\ge k_2$, which is $k \\ge 36$.\n\nTo satisfy both conditions, $k$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum of the two individual minimal lengths:\n$$k \\ge \\max(k_1, k_2)$$\n$$k \\ge \\max(31, 36)$$\n$$k \\ge 36$$\n\nThe minimal integer bait length $k$ that satisfies all problem constraints is therefore $36$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{36}$$", "id": "4388237"}, {"introduction": "Once a specific gene panel is designed, a crucial next step is planning the sequencing experiment to ensure it has sufficient sensitivity, especially for challenging applications like liquid biopsy.

The VAF is the fraction of total alleles in the sample that carry the mutation.\n\nLet's consider a representative tissue sample. The sample is composed of a fraction $p$ of tumor cells and a fraction $(1-p)$ of normal cells. Both cell types are diploid, meaning each cell contains $2$ copies of each autosomal locus.\n\nThe total number of alleles at a given locus in the sample is proportional to $p \\cdot 2 + (1-p) \\cdot 2 = 2$.\n\nThe mutant alleles originate only from the tumor cells. Within the tumor cell population, a fraction $c$ (the cellular prevalence) harbors the mutation. The somatic mutation is heterozygous, meaning each mutated tumor cell has one mutant allele and one wild-type allele (mutant multiplicity $m=1$).\n\nThe number of mutant alleles in the sample is proportional to the fraction of cells that are mutated tumor cells ($p \\cdot c$) multiplied by the number of mutant alleles per mutated cell ($m$).\nThus, the contribution of mutant alleles is proportional to $p \\cdot c \\cdot m$.\n\nThe VAF is the ratio of the mutant allele contribution to the total allele contribution:\n$$\n\\text{VAF} = \\frac{p \\cdot c \\cdot m}{p \\cdot 2 + (1-p) \\cdot 2} = \\frac{p \\cdot c \\cdot m}{2(p + 1 - p)} = \\frac{p \\cdot c \\cdot m}{2}\n$$\nGiven that $m = 1$, the formula simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{VAF} = \\frac{p \\cdot c}{2}\n$$\n\nWe can now apply this formula to the two specified cases.\n\n**1.
