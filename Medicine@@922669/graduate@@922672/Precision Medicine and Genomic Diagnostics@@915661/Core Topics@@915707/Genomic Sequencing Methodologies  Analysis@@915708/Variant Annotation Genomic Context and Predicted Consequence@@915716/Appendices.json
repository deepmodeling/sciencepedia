This first practice provides a foundational exercise in applying the central dogma to a hypothetical in-frame deletion. By manually translating the original and altered sequences, you will see firsthand how a deletion of three base pairs removes amino acids without disrupting the downstream reading frame, a key distinction in variant classification [@problem_id:4394932].", "problem": "A clinical laboratory is annotating a small coding segment of a transcript in the context of precision medicine. The coding Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) sequence for a region spanning positions $1$ through $21$ (inclusive) is given below, with the reading frame known to initiate at position $1$ so that codons are contiguous triplets starting at positions $1$, $4$, $7$, $10$, $13$, $16$, and $19$:\n\nATG GCT GAA CCA TTT ACC GGT\n\nA constitutional variant is identified as a $3$ base pair deletion that begins at the second nucleotide of the third codon in this region.

The comparison is to be quantified using the Levenshtein distance, $d_L$.\n\nFirst, the original DNA sequence and its translation into a peptide sequence are determined. The given coding DNA sequence, arranged in codons as per the specified reading frame starting at position $1$, is:\n$\\text{ATG GCT GAA CCA TTT ACC GGT}$\n\nAccording to the Central Dogma of molecular biology, this DNA sequence is first transcribed into a messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) sequence. In this process, the DNA base Thymine (T) is replaced by Uracil (U). The resulting mRNA sequence is:\n$\\text{AUG GCU GAA CCA UUU ACC GGU}$\n\nThis mRNA sequence is then translated into a sequence of amino acids (a peptide). Using the standard genetic code, each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid:\n- $\\text{AUG} \\to$ Methionine ($\\text{Met}$, $\\text{M}$)\n- $\\text{GCU} \\to$ Alanine ($\\text{Ala}$, $\\text{A}$)\n- $\\text{GAA} \\to$ Glutamic Acid ($\\text{Glu}$, $\\text{E}$)\n- $\\text{CCA} \\to$ Proline ($\\text{Pro}$, $\\text{P}$)\n- $\\text{UUU} \\to$ Phenylalanine ($\\text{Phe}$, $\\text{F}$)\n- $\\text{ACC} \\to$ Threonine ($\\text{Thr}$, $\\text{T}$)\n- $\\text{GGU} \\to$ Glycine ($\\text{Gly}$, $\\text{G}$)\n\nThus, the original peptide sequence, which we denote as $S_1$, is:\n$S_1 = \\text{Met-Ala-Glu-Pro-Phe-Thr-Gly}$ (or $\\text{M-A-E-P-F-T-G}$)\nThis sequence has a length of $7$ amino acids.\n\nNext, we analyze the effect of the constitutional variant, which is a $3$ base pair (bp) deletion. The problem states the deletion begins at the second nucleotide of the third codon. Let us identify this location.\nThe original DNA sequence is $\\text{ATG GCT GAA CCA TTT ACC GGT}$.\n- The first codon is $\\text{ATG}$ (positions $1$-$3$).\n- The second codon is $\\text{GCT}$ (positions $4$-$6$).\n- The third codon is $\\text{GAA}$ (positions $7$-$9$).\n\nThe second nucleotide of the third codon is the base $\\text{A}$ at position $8$. The deletion is $3$ bp long, so it removes the nucleotides at positions $8$, $9$, and $10$.\nThe original sequence can be written contiguously: $\\text{ATGGCTGAACCATTTACCGGT}$.\n- Position $8$: $\\text{A}$\n- Position $9$: $\\text{A}$\n- Position $10$: $\\text{C}$ (from the start of the fourth codon, $\\text{CCA}$)\n\nThe deleted $3$ bp segment is $\\text{AAC}$. Removing this from the original sequence:\nOriginal: $\\text{ATG GCT G} \\vert \\text{AAC} \\vert \\text{CATTTACCGGT}$\nAltered: $\\text{ATGGCTGCATTTACCGGT}$\n\nThe total length is now $21 - 3 = 18$ bp. We now re-apply the reading frame (triplet codons starting from position $1$) to this altered DNA sequence:\n$\\text{ATG GCT GCA TTT ACC GGT}$\n\nThis altered DNA sequence is transcribed into its corresponding mRNA sequence:\n$\\text{AUG GCU GCA UUU ACC GGU}$\n\nTranslating this altered mRNA sequence using the standard genetic code:\n- $\\text{AUG} \\to$ Methionine ($\\text{Met}$, $\\text{M}$)\n- $\\text{GCU} \\to$ Alanine ($\\text{Ala}$, $\\text{A}$)\n- $\\text{GCA} \\to$ Alanine ($\\text{Ala}$, $\\text{A}$)\n- $\\text{UUU} \\to$ Phenylalanine ($\\text{Phe}$, $\\text{F}$)\n- $\\text{ACC} \\to$ Threonine ($\\text{Thr}$, $\\text{T}$)\n- $\\text{GGU} \\to$ Glycine ($\\text{Gly}$, $\\text{G}$)\n\nThe altered peptide sequence, denoted $S_2$, is:\n$S_2 = \\text{Met-Ala-Ala-Phe-Thr-Gly}$ (or $\\text{M-A-A-F-T-G}$)\nThis sequence has a length of $6$ amino acids.\n\nThe problem first asks whether the reading frame is preserved. A frameshift mutation occurs when the number of inserted or deleted bases is not a multiple of $3$. In this case, the deletion is exactly $3$ bp long. This constitutes an \"in-frame\" deletion. It removes the genetic information equivalent to one codon, which results in the loss of one or more amino acids and potentially the alteration of another at the mutation site. However, the reading frame for all codons downstream of the mutation remains intact. This is evident as the codons $\\text{TTT}$, $\\text{ACC}$, and $\\text{GGT}$ are present and in-frame in both the original and altered sequences.\n\nFinally, we must compute the Levenshtein distance, $d_L$, between the original peptide sequence $S_1$ and the altered peptide sequence $S_2$. The Levenshtein distance is the minimum number of single-unit edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one sequence into the other.\n\nOriginal sequence ($S_1$): $\\text{M-A-E-P-F-T-G}$\nAltered sequence ($S_2$): $\\text{M-A-A-F-T-G}$\n\nWe can find the minimum number of edits by aligning the two sequences:\n\nAlignment 1:\n$S_1$: $\\text{M A E P F T G}$\n$S_2$: $\\text{M A A - F T G}$\n\n- $\\text{M} \\to \\text{M}$: Match (cost $0$)\n- $\\text{A} \\to \\text{A}$: Match (cost $0$)\n- $\\text{E} \\to \\text{A}$: Substitution (cost $1$)\n- $\\text{P} \\to \\text{-}$: Deletion (cost $1$)\n- $\\text{F} \\to \\text{F}$: Match (cost $0$)\n- $\\text{T} \\to \\text{T}$: Match (cost $0$)\n- $\\text{G} \\to \\text{G}$: Match (cost $0$)\n\nThe total cost for this alignment is $1 + 1 = 2$. This alignment represents one substitution (Glutamic acid to Alanine) and one deletion (Proline). This is a direct consequence of the original codons $\\text{GAA}$ ($\\text{E}$) and $\\text{CCA}$ ($\\text{P}$) being replaced by the single new codon $\\text{GCA}$ ($\\text{A}$).\n\nNo other alignment can achieve a lower cost. For example, deleting $\\text{E}$ and substituting $\\text{P}$ with $\\text{A}$ also results in a cost of $2$. Therefore, the minimum number of operations is $2$.\n\nThe Levenshtein distance $d_L$ is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "4394932"}, {"introduction": "While small, in-frame events alter a protein locally, deletions or insertions whose length is not a multiple of three have far more drastic consequences.

All segments described below are fully coding sequence, and splice junctions are canonical such that the reading frame is preserved in the reference transcript. The lengths of the coding portions of these exons, measured in nucleotides, are as follows: exon $3$ has length $158$, exon $4$ has length $120$, exon $5$ has length $131$, exon $6$ has length $145$, exon $7$ has length $98$, exon $8$ has length $180$, exon $9$ has length $90$, and exon $10$ has length $220$. Consider a deletion variant that removes exons $i=5$ through $j=7$ inclusive from the mature messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) molecule, creating a novel junction directly connecting exon $4$ to exon $8$. Assume the start codon and the normal stop codon are outside the deleted region.\n\nUse only the following fundamental bases to derive the consequences: the Central Dogma of molecular biology (deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein), the fact that translation proceeds in triplet codons of three nucleotides, canonical splicing preserves reading frame across exon junctions, and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is typically triggered when a premature termination codon (PTC) lies more than $50$ to $55$ nucleotides upstream of the last exon–exon junction recognized by the Exon Junction Complex (EJC). Furthermore, for estimating the expected position of the first PTC in a shifted reading frame, assume uniform codon usage such that at each codon the probability of encountering a stop codon is $\\frac{3}{64}$, independently of previous codons.\n\nStarting from these bases and without invoking shortcut formulas, derive whether the deletion spanning exons $5$ through $7$ produces an in-frame or frameshift consequence on the transcript and explain the mechanistic implications for predicted loss-of-function, including whether NMD is expected if the last exon–exon junction lies exactly $120$ nucleotides downstream of the novel exon $4$–exon $8$ junction created by the deletion.\n\nFor your final numerical answer, report the remainder\n$$\\Delta = \\left(\\sum_{k=i}^{j} L_k\\right) \\bmod 3,$$\nwhere $L_k$ is the coding length (in nucleotides) of exon $k$, evaluated for $i=5$ and $j=7$.

If you compute any intermediate numeric quantities in your reasoning, express distances in nucleotides (nt).", "solution": "The Central Dogma of molecular biology states that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is transcribed into messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), which is translated into protein. Translation reads mRNA in triplet units called codons, each comprising $3$ nucleotides, thereby defining a reading frame. A frameshift occurs when an insertion or deletion changes the number of coding nucleotides by a non-multiple of $3$, altering the mapping of codons downstream. Canonical splicing preserves the reading frame across exon junctions in the reference transcript, meaning that without structural changes, the cumulative codon reading phase progresses consistently as exons are concatenated.\n\nTo determine the impact of a deletion that removes entire exons $i$ through $j$, we reason from the definition of codons and the cumulative phase. Let the coding length of exon $k$ be $L_k$ nucleotides. Define the cumulative phase at the end of exon $k$ as\n$$\\phi_k = \\left(\\sum_{m=3}^{k} L_m\\right) \\bmod 3,$$\nstarting with phase $0$ at the beginning of coding (without loss of generality). In canonical splicing, the reading frame continuity implies that the phase at the start of exon $k+1$ equals $\\phi_k$. If we delete exons $i$ through $j$, the novel junction connects exon $i-1$ to exon $j+1$. For this new junction to be in-frame relative to the upstream reading, the phase at the end of exon $i-1$ must equal the phase at the start of exon $j+1$ in the modified transcript. In the unmodified transcript, the start phase of exon $j+1$ equals $\\phi_j$, and the end phase of exon $i-1$ equals $\\phi_{i-1}$. After deletion, the upstream phase arriving at exon $j+1$ will be $\\phi_{i-1}$ rather than $\\phi_j$. Therefore, in-frame requires\n$$\\phi_{i-1} \\equiv \\phi_j \\pmod{3}.$$\nThis equivalence is equivalent to requiring\n$$\\left(\\sum_{k=i}^{j} L_k\\right) \\bmod 3 = 0,$$\nsince $\\phi_j - \\phi_{i-1} \\equiv \\left(\\sum_{k=i}^{j} L_k\\right) \\bmod 3$. Thus, the deletion is in-frame if and only if the total number of removed coding nucleotides is a multiple of $3$; otherwise, it is a frameshift.\n\nWe now evaluate this for the given exon coding lengths. The lengths are\n$$L_5 = 131,\\quad L_6 = 145,\\quad L_7 = 98.$$\nThe total removed coding nucleotides are\n$$\\sum_{k=5}^{7} L_k = 131 + 145 + 98 = 374.$$\nCompute the remainder modulo $3$:\n$$\\Delta = 374 \\bmod 3.$$\nWe can compute $374 \\bmod 3$ using the fact that $3$ divides $372$ exactly, so\n$$374 - 372 = 2,$$\nhence\n$$\\Delta = 2.$$\nBecause $\\Delta \\neq 0$, the deletion produces a frameshift at the novel exon $4$–exon $8$ junction.\n\nNext, we analyze the implications for predicted loss-of-function. A frameshift alters the downstream reading frame, commonly introducing a premature termination codon (PTC). Under the assumption of uniform codon usage, the probability that any codon is a stop codon is\n$$p = \\frac{3}{64}.$$\nIf we model the codon-by-codon occurrence of a stop as a geometric process with success probability $p$, the expected number of codons until the first stop codon is\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\text{codons to stop}] = \\frac{1}{p} = \\frac{64}{3}.$$\nConverting codons to nucleotides by multiplying by $3$ nucleotides per codon,\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\text{nucleotides to stop}] = \\frac{64}{3} \\times 3 = 64\\ \\text{nt}.$$\nTherefore, the expected distance from the frameshift junction to the first PTC is $64$ nucleotides.\n\nNonsense-mediated decay (NMD) typically occurs when a PTC is located more than $50$ to $55$ nucleotides upstream of the last exon–exon junction recognized by the Exon Junction Complex (EJC). The problem states that the last exon–exon junction lies exactly $120$ nucleotides downstream of the novel exon $4$–exon $8$ junction. If the expected PTC is $64$ nucleotides downstream of the junction, then its position relative to the last EJC is\n$$120 - 64 = 56\\ \\text{nt upstream of the last exon–exon junction}.$$\nBecause $56$ nucleotides upstream exceeds the $50$ to $55$ nucleotide threshold, NMD is expected under the canonical rule. Consequently, the frameshift is predicted to result in loss-of-function both via degradation of the transcript by NMD and, if any residual transcript escapes NMD, via production of a truncated protein.\n\nFinally, the requested numerical remainder is\n$$\\Delta = 2,$$\nindicating a frameshift.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "4394865"}, {"introduction": "Predicting a variant's biological impact is only half the battle; communicating that impact unambiguously is equally critical. This final practice moves from a purely biological prediction to a common challenge in clinical annotation: the dependency of a variant's name on the chosen reference transcript.

The principles invoked—the Central Dogma, the genetic code, and HGVS nomenclature—are foundational to the field of genomic diagnostics. The provided data for the two transcripts are internally consistent and represent a realistic scenario in clinical genomics.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in converting cDNA (complementary DNA) coordinates to protein-level (amino acid) coordinates. For a coding sequence (CDS) where translation initiates at the first codon, an amino acid at position $P$ in the protein sequence is encoded by the $P$-th codon. This codon consists of nucleotides at cDNA positions $3P-2$, $3P-1$, and $3P$. Consequently, for any given nucleotide at a cDNA coordinate $C$ within the CDS, the corresponding amino acid residue number, $P$, is determined by the ceiling of the division of $C$ by $3$. This relationship is expressed by the formula:\n$$P = \\left\\lceil \\frac{C}{3} \\right\\rceil$$\n\nWe will now apply this principle to each transcript.\n\n**1. Analysis of the RefSeq Transcript (NM_000001.3)**\n\nFor the RefSeq transcript, the variant is given as $c.253\\mathrm{GA}$. The cDNA coordinate of the substitution is $C_{\\text{RefSeq}} = 253$.\nThe corresponding amino acid residue number is calculated as:\n$$P_{\\text{RefSeq}} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{253}{3} \\right\\rceil = \\lceil 84.33\\overline{3} \\rceil = 85$$\nThe variant is at the $85$-th amino acid residue.\nThe problem states that the reference codon triplet spanning positions $c.253$ to $c.255$ is $\\mathrm{GGA}$. The variant $c.253\\mathrm{GA}$ occurs at the first position of this codon.\n- Reference codon: $\\mathrm{GGA}$, which codes for the amino acid Glycine (Gly).\n- Variant codon: $\\mathrm{AGA}$, which codes for the amino acid Arginine (Arg).\nThis is a missense variant. According to HGVS nomenclature, the protein-level consequence is denoted $p.(\\text{ReferenceAminoAcid})(\\text{Position})(\\text{AlternateAminoAcid})$.\nTherefore, for the RefSeq transcript, the consequence is $p.(\\text{Gly}85\\text{Arg})$.\n\n**2.

The variant is $c.343\\mathrm{GA}$.\n- Reference codon: $\\mathrm{GGA}$ (Glycine, Gly).\n- Variant codon: $\\mathrm{AGA}$ (Arginine, Arg).\nThe protein-level consequence for the Ensembl transcript is therefore $p.(\\text{Gly}115\\text{Arg})$.\n\n**3. Consistency Check and Calculation of the Difference**\n\nThe problem states that the Ensembl CDS begins $90$ nucleotides upstream of the RefSeq CDS. Since a codon is $3$ nucleotides long, this corresponds to an N-terminal extension of $90/3 = 30$ amino acids in the Ensembl protein relative to the RefSeq protein. Thus, an amino acid at position $P$ in the RefSeq protein should correspond to the amino acid at position $P+30$ in the Ensembl protein.\nOur calculations yield $P_{\\text{RefSeq}} = 85$ and $P_{\\text{Ensembl}} = 115$. Let's verify:\n$$P_{\\text{RefSeq}} + 30 = 85 + 30 = 115 = P_{\\text{Ensembl}}$$\nThe results are consistent with the provided transcript structures.\n\nThe problem requires the absolute difference in the amino acid residue numbers between the two consequence strings.\nLet this difference be $\\Delta P$.\n$$\\Delta P = |P_{\\text{Ensembl}} - P_{\\text{RefSeq}}| = |115 - 85| = 30$$\n\n**4. Clinical Reporting and Harmonization**\n\nIn a clinical context, ambiguity is unacceptable. Since a single genomic variant can have different HGVS descriptions depending on the reference transcript, it is mandatory to specify the transcript identifier for which the consequence is reported. The standard format is to include the transcript identifier followed by a colon and the full HGVS description.\n\nFor this case, the reporting would be:\n- For RefSeq: `NM_000001.3:c.253G>A(p.Gly85Arg)`\n- For Ensembl: `ENST000002.2:c.343G>A(p.Gly115Arg)`\n\nIn practice, a clinical laboratory must establish a clear policy for transcript selection. Often, a single \"canonical\" or \"principal\" transcript is chosen for reporting, typically based on criteria such as length, expression level, conservation, or designation by authoritative bodies like the Locus Reference Genomic (LRG) consortium. If no single transcript is clearly the most relevant, or if different isoforms have distinct clinical implications, it may be necessary to report the consequences for multiple transcripts to provide a complete picture to the clinician.
