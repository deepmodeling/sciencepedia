The use of a Bernoulli trial framework to model independent sequencing errors is a standard and fundamental approach in bioinformatics. The Phred score transformation $e = 10^{-Q/10}$ is the established definition used universally in sequencing data analysis. The scenario described is a simplified but conceptually sound model for analyzing sequencing data quality and calculating variant calling likelihoods.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is mathematically well-posed. It specifies a series of $n$ independent trials, a constant probability of a specific outcome ($e$), and asks for the probability of observing exactly $k$ such outcomes. This is a classic problem in probability theory with a unique, well-defined solution.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free of any subjectivity or ambiguity. All terms such as \"coverage depth,\" \"independent,\" and \"Bernoulli trial\" have clear, formal definitions in the context of statistics and genomics.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any invalidating flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, or unrealistic within the context of a foundational model. It is a well-structured problem that requires the application of first principles of probability theory to a relevant scientific context.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem asks for the probability of observing exactly $k$ erroneous base calls in a set of $n$ independent sequencing reads. This scenario can be modeled precisely using the framework of Bernoulli trials.\n\nA single sequencing read at the specified locus represents a single trial. We define the outcome of this trial as a \"success\" if the base call is erroneous, and a \"failure\" if the base call is correct (matches the reference).\n\nAccording to the problem statement:\n- The probability of a \"success\" (an erroneous base call) in any single trial is $p = e$.\n- The probability of a \"failure\" (a correct base call) is therefore $q = 1 - p = 1 - e$.\n\nWe have a total of $n$ such trials, corresponding to the $n$ independent reads. The trials are independent and the probability of success $e$ is the same for each trial. This is the classic definition of a binomial process. We want to find the probability of achieving exactly $k$ successes in these $n$ trials.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in two parts:\n1.  **Combinatorial Component**: We must determine the number of distinct ways in which $k$ errors can be distributed among the $n$ reads. This is a problem of choosing $k$ items from a set of $n$ without regard to order. The number of ways is given by the binomial coefficient, denoted as $\\binom{n}{k}$, which is calculated as:\n    $$\n    \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\n    $$\n    where $n!$ represents the factorial of $n$.\n\n2.  **Probability Component**: Consider one specific arrangement of $k$ errors and $n-k$ correct reads. For example, the first $k$ reads being erroneous and the remaining $n-k$ reads being correct. Since the reads are independent events, the probability of this specific sequence occurring is the product of the individual probabilities:\n    $$\n    \\underbrace{e \\times e \\times \\dots \\times e}_{k \\text{ times}} \\times \\underbrace{(1-e) \\times (1-e) \\times \\dots \\times (1-e)}_{n-k \\text{ times}} = e^k (1-e)^{n-k}\n    $$\n    Crucially, because the trials are i.i.d., any other specific arrangement of $k$ errors and $n-k$ correct reads has the exact same probability of occurrence, $e^k (1-e)^{n-k}$.\n\nTo find the total probability of observing exactly $k$ errors, we must sum the probabilities of all possible mutually exclusive arrangements. Since there are $\\binom{n}{k}$ such arrangements and each has a probability of $e^k (1-e)^{n-k}$, the total probability is the product of the combinatorial component and the probability component.\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the number of erroneous base calls. The probability mass function for $X=k$ is:\n$$\nP(X=k) = (\\text{Number of ways to get } k \\text{ errors}) \\times (\\text{Probability of any one specific way})\n$$\n$$\nP(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} e^k (1-e)^{n-k}\n$$\nThis is the probability mass function for a binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $e$. The expression is a closed-form function of $n$, $k$, and $e$, as required.

You are given a pileup summary of base calls and their Phred-scaled base qualities at the locus; all reads have mapping quality $\\mathrm{MQ} \\geq 30$. The pileup (counts by observed base and base quality) is:\n- $18$ reads call $G$ with base quality $Q=30$,\n- $4$ reads call $G$ with base quality $Q=20$,\n- $12$ reads call $A$ with base quality $Q=35$,\n- $2$ reads call $A$ with base quality $Q=25$,\n- $2$ reads call $T$ with base quality $Q=15$.\n\nFor variant calling, apply the following data curation and modeling assumptions grounded in standard practice:\n1. Only reads with base quality at the locus $\\geq Q_{\\min}=20$ and mapping quality $\\geq 30$ are considered for downstream calculations.\n2. For a biallelic site in the Variant Call Format (VCF), the allele depths (AD) field contains two integers: the number of passing reads supporting the reference allele and the number supporting the listed alternate allele. Reads with bases not matching either the reference $G$ or the alternate $A$ are excluded from AD.\n3. To estimate the allele fraction (AF), use a per-read probabilistic contribution under the following model:\n   - The per-read sequencing error probability at the locus is $\\epsilon = 10^{-Q/10}$ for base quality $Q$.\n   - Conditional on a sequencing error, miscalls are uniformly distributed among the other three nucleotides.\n   - The prior on the true allele carried by a randomly sampled DNA molecule at this locus is symmetric, with $\\Pr(\\text{alt}) = \\Pr(\\text{ref}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n   - Use only passing reads as defined in item $1$.\n\nStarting from these assumptions and first principles (Bayes rule and the Phred definition), compute the allele depths (AD) and the allele fraction (AF) to populate the corresponding fields for this biallelic SNP in a single-sample VCF record.

It describes a standard bioinformatics task of variant calling using realistic data and a simplified but valid probabilistic model. There are no identifiable flaws; therefore, a complete solution is warranted.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three steps as outlined in the problem:\n1. Identification of passing reads based on quality filters.\n2. Calculation of allele depths (AD) for the reference and alternate alleles.\n3. Estimation of the allele fraction (AF) using the specified Bayesian probabilistic model.\n\n**Step 1: Filtering Reads**\n\nThe problem specifies two quality filters for a read to be considered \"passing\" and included in downstream calculations:\n- Base quality at the locus, $Q$, must be greater than or equal to $Q_{\\min}=20$.\n- Mapping quality, $\\mathrm{MQ}$, must be greater than or equal to $30$.\n\nThe problem states that all reads have $\\mathrm{MQ} \\geq 30$, so only the base quality filter needs to be applied to the provided pileup summary:\n- $18$ reads with observed base $G$ and $Q=30$: Since $30 \\geq 20$, these reads pass.\n- $4$ reads with observed base $G$ and $Q=20$: Since $20 \\geq 20$, these reads pass.\n- $12$ reads with observed base $A$ and $Q=35$: Since $35 \\geq 20$, these reads pass.\n- $2$ reads with observed base $A$ and $Q=25$: Since $25 \\geq 20$, these reads pass.\n- $2$ reads with observed base $T$ and $Q=15$: Since $15 < 20$, these reads are filtered out and excluded from all further analysis.\n\nThe set of passing reads comprises $18+4+12+2 = 36$ reads. However, for calculating AD and AF for a biallelic $G$/$A$ site, only reads observed as $G$ or $A$ are relevant. The reads observed as $T$ failed the quality filter anyway. The total number of passing reads to be used in the AF calculation is $N_{\\text{passing}} = (18+4) + (12+2) = 22 + 14 = 36$.\n\n**Step 2: Allele Depths (AD)**\n\nThe allele depths (AD) field for a VCF record contains the counts of passing reads that support the reference and alternate alleles. The reference allele is $G$ and the alternate allele is $A$.\n- Number of passing reads supporting the reference allele ($G$): $18$ (with $Q=30$) + $4$ (with $Q=20$) = $22$.\n- Number of passing reads supporting the alternate allele ($A$): $12$ (with $Q=35$) + $2$ (with $Q=25$) = $14$.\n\nThe resulting allele depths are $\\mathrm{AD} = (22, 14)$.\n\n**Step 3: Allele Fraction (AF)**\n\nThe allele fraction (AF) is estimated as the average of the per-read posterior probabilities of the alternate allele ($A$), calculated over all $N_{\\text{passing}}=36$ passing reads. For each read $i$ with observed base $O_i$ and base quality $Q_i$, we must compute the posterior probability $\\Pr(T_i=A | O_i, Q_i)$, where $T_i$ is the true allele of the DNA molecule from which the read originated.\n\nWe use Bayes' rule:\n$$\n\\Pr(T=A | O, Q) = \\frac{\\Pr(O | T=A, Q) \\Pr(T=A)}{\\Pr(O | Q)}\n$$\nThe total probability in the denominator is $\\Pr(O|Q) = \\Pr(O|T=A,Q)\\Pr(T=A) + \\Pr(O|T=G,Q)\\Pr(T=G)$. The problem specifies a symmetric prior $\\Pr(T=A) = \\Pr(T=G) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Substituting this prior simplifies the expression:\n$$\n\\Pr(T=A | O, Q) = \\frac{\\Pr(O | T=A, Q)}{\\Pr(O | T=A, Q) + \\Pr(O | T=G, Q)}\n$$\nThe likelihoods, $\\Pr(O | T, Q)$, are determined by the Phred-scaled error probability $\\epsilon = 10^{-Q/10}$ and the uniform error model.\n- If the observed base $O$ matches the true allele $T$, the likelihood is the probability of no error: $\\Pr(O=T | T, Q) = 1 - \\epsilon$.\n- If $O$ does not match $T$, the likelihood is the probability of an error resulting in that specific base: $\\Pr(O \\neq T | T, Q) = \\epsilon/3$.\n\nWe now compute the posterior probability for two distinct cases:\nCase 1: The observed base is the alternate allele ($O=A$).\n$$\nP_1 = \\Pr(T=A | O=A, Q) = \\frac{\\Pr(O=A | T=A, Q)}{\\Pr(O=A | T=A, Q) + \\Pr(O=A | T=G, Q)} = \\frac{1 - 10^{-Q/10}}{(1 - 10^{-Q/10}) + (\\frac{1}{3} \\times 10^{-Q/10})} = \\frac{1 - 10^{-Q/10}}{1 - \\frac{2}{3} \\times 10^{-Q/10}}\n$$\nCase 2: The observed base is the reference allele ($O=G$).\n$$\nP_2 = \\Pr(T=A | O=G, Q) = \\frac{\\Pr(O=G | T=A, Q)}{\\Pr(O=G | T=A, Q) + \\Pr(O=G | T=G, Q)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\times 10^{-Q/10}}{(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 10^{-Q/10}) + (1 - 10^{-Q/10})} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\times 10^{-Q/10}}{1 - \\frac{2}{3} \\times 10^{-Q/10}}\n$$\nWe apply these formulas to the four groups of passing reads:\n1. For the $12$ reads with $(O=A, Q=35)$:\n   $P_{\\text{A,35}} = \\frac{1 - 10^{-3.5}}{1 - \\frac{2}{3} \\times 10^{-3.5}} \\approx \\frac{1 - 0.0003162}{1 - \\frac{2}{3} \\times 0.0003162} \\approx 0.99989456$\n2.

A simple count-based allele fraction would be $\\frac{14}{36} \\approx 0.3889$. Our probabilistic model yields a slightly higher value, $0.3893$. This reflects the fact that the reads supporting the alternate allele ($A$) have, on average, higher base quality ($Q=35$ and $Q=25$) than the reads supporting the reference allele ($G$) ($Q=30$ and $Q=20$), thus lending them slightly more weight in the posterior calculation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3893}$$", "id": "4395708"}, {"introduction": "The most sophisticated variant callers combine evidence from sequencing data with prior knowledge about population genetics to improve accuracy.
