Consistent normalization enables unambiguous mapping of submissions across resources. Use the following foundational bases:\n\n- The Variant Call Format (VCF) represents indels using an anchor base: the reference allele includes one left-flanking base at the variant position, and the alternate allele includes that same left-flanking base plus the inserted sequence for insertions or excludes the deleted sequence for deletions.\n- Left alignment moves an indel within a repetitive context to the smallest possible coordinate while preserving the same haplotype change under the reference genome, by sliding the variant left within identical repeat units.\n- Minimal representation trims all shared leading and trailing sequence between the reference and alternate alleles so that the $(\\text{REF}, \\text{ALT})$ pair is the shortest possible while still encoding the same change.\n\nAssume `1-based` genomic coordinates and the following reference substring spanning a homopolymer tract:\n\n- At coordinate $2000$ the base is $T$.\n- At coordinates $2001$ through $2009$ the bases are all $A$ (a homopolymer run of $A$).\n- Bases outside this window need not be used.\n\nThree observed indels, described in Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) notation relative to this reference, are:\n\n- $V_{1}$: $g.2005\\_2006insA$ (an insertion of $A$ between positions $2005$ and $2006$).\n- $V_{2}$: $g.2006\\_2007delAA$ (a deletion of $AA$ spanning positions $2006$ to $2007$).\n- $V_{3}$: $g.2003\\_2005delAAA$ (a deletion of $AAA$ spanning positions $2003$ to $2005$).\n\nApply left alignment and minimal representation under the VCF convention to derive the unique normalized $(\\text{POS}, \\text{REF}, \\text{ALT})$ triple for each $V_{i}$.

The goal is to find the normalized VCF position ($p_i$) for each variant and compute their sum, $S = p_1 + p_2 + p_3$.\n\nThe reference sequence provided is defined by:\n- A base $T$ at coordinate $2000$.\n- A homopolymer run of nine $A$ bases from coordinate $2001$ to $2009$.\nThe relevant portion of the reference sequence is:\nPosition: $... 2000 \\ 2001 \\ 2002 \\ 2003 \\ 2004 \\ 2005 \\ 2006 \\ 2007 \\ 2008 \\ 2009 ...$\nBase:     $... \\ \\ T \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\ ...$\n\nVariant normalization is a standard procedure in genomics to ensure that a given DNA sequence change has a single, canonical representation. The process involves two main steps: left alignment and minimal representation.\n\n1.  **Left Alignment**: An indel is shifted to the left-most possible position within a repetitive sequence context without changing the resulting haplotype. In VCF format, this corresponds to finding the representation $(\\text{POS}, \\text{REF}, \\text{ALT})$ with the smallest possible value for $\\text{POS}$.\n2.  **Minimal Representation**: The `REF` and `ALT` alleles are trimmed to be as short as possible. The combination of these steps yields a unique, canonical representation. For VCF, this involves representing an empty allele by padding it with an anchor base from the preceding position.\n\nWe will apply this procedure to each variant.\n\n### Variant $V_1$: $g.2005\\_2006insA$\nThis is an insertion of a single base, $A$, between positions $2005$ and $2006$. This insertion occurs within the described poly-$A$ tract.\n\n1.  **Haplotype Change**: The reference sequence has a run of nine consecutive $A$'s. $V_1$ introduces a tenth $A$, changing the run from $A_9$ to $A_{10}$.\n2.  **Left Alignment**: An insertion of an $A$ into a poly-$A$ tract can be shifted to any position within that tract without altering the final sequence. The principle of left alignment dictates that we shift it to the left-most possible position. The poly-$A$ tract starts at coordinate $2001$, immediately following a $T$ at coordinate $2000$. Therefore, the left-most position for the insertion is between coordinates $2000$ and $2001$.\n3.  **VCF Representation**: We need to find the canonical VCF triple for an insertion of $A$ between positions $2000$ and $2001$.\n    - According to VCF rules, this insertion is represented by using the anchor base at position $2000$, which is $T$.\n    - The alleles become $\\text{REF} = T$ and $\\text{ALT} = TA$.\n    - The position is the coordinate of the anchor base, so $\\text{POS} = 2000$.\n    - The final, normalized VCF representation for $V_1$ is $(\\text{POS}=2000, \\text{REF}=T, \\text{ALT}=TA)$.\n    - The normalized position is $p_1 = 2000$.\n\n### Variant $V_2$: $g.2006\\_2007delAA$\nThis is a deletion of two bases, $AA$, from positions $2006$ and $2007$. This deletion also occurs within the poly-$A$ tract.\n\n1.  **Haplotype Change**: The reference run of nine $A$'s is reduced by two, resulting in a run of seven $A$'s ($A_9 \\rightarrow A_7$).\n2.  **Left Alignment**: Similar to the insertion, a deletion of $A$'s from a poly-$A$ tract can be slid leftwards. The left-most position for a deletion of $AA$ corresponds to deleting the first two $A$'s in the run, which are at coordinates $2001$ and $2002$.\n3.  **VCF Representation**: We find the VCF triple for a deletion of the bases at positions $2001$ and $2002$.\n    - The anchor base is $\\text{Ref}[2000] = T$. The sequence to be deleted is `AA`.\n    - The alleles become $\\text{REF} = TAA$ and $\\text{ALT} = T$.\n    - The position is the coordinate of the anchor base: $\\text{POS} = 2000$.\n    - The final, normalized VCF representation for $V_2$ is $(\\text{POS}=2000, \\text{REF}=TAA, \\text{ALT}=T)$.\n    - The normalized position is $p_2 = 2000$.\n\n### Variant $V_3$: $g.2003\\_2005delAAA$\nThis is a deletion of three bases, $AAA$, from positions $2003$ through $2005$.\n\n1.  **Haplotype Change**: The reference run of nine $A$'s is reduced by three, resulting in a run of six $A$'s ($A_9 \\rightarrow A_6$).\n2.  **Left Alignment**: The deletion of $AAA$ is shifted left to the beginning of the poly-$A$ tract. The left-most position involves deleting the bases at coordinates $2001$, $2002$, and $2003$.\n3.  **VCF Representation**: We find the VCF triple for a deletion of bases at positions $2001$, $2002$, and $2003$.\n    - The anchor base is $\\text{Ref}[2000] = T$. The sequence to be deleted is `AAA`.\n    - The alleles become $\\text{REF} = TAAA$ and $\\text{ALT} = T$.\n    - The position is the coordinate of the anchor base: $\\text{POS} = 2000$.\n    - The final, normalized VCF representation for $V_3$ is $(\\text{POS}=2000, \\text{REF}=TAAA, \\text{ALT}=T)$.\n    - The normalized position is $p_3 = 2000$.\n\n### Calculation of the Sum\nAll three indels, when normalized, are anchored to the base at position $2000$, which immediately precedes the homopolymer tract. Thus, the normalized VCF position for all three variants is $2000$.\n\n$p_1 = 2000$\n$p_2 = 2000$\n$p_3 = 2000$\n\nThe sum $S$ is computed as:\n$$S = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 2000 + 2000 + 2000 = 6000$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6000}$$", "id": "4327261"}, {"introduction": "With a variant canonically defined, the next critical task is to evaluate its potential role in disease.

Transcript $\\mathrm{T1}$ initiates its coding DNA sequence (CDS) at genomic coordinate $7{:}1{,}000{,}000$, and transcript $\\mathrm{T2}$ initiates its CDS at genomic coordinate $7{:}999{,}970$. Both transcripts share the same downstream exons and coding sequence after the start, but their $5'$ coding segments differ because $\\mathrm{T2}$ has an upstream start codon.\n\nThe local reference coding DNA for transcript $\\mathrm{T1}$ in the region $c.$ positions $300$ to $312$ is as follows: the base at $c.300$ is the cytosine immediately preceding a homopolymeric tract of four consecutive codons encoding glutamate (\"GAA\"), i.e., $c.301\\text{–}c.303 = \\text{\"GAA\"}$, $c.304\\text{–}c.306 = \\text{\"GAA\"}$, $c.307\\text{–}c.309 = \\text{\"GAA\"}$, and $c.310\\text{–}c.312 = \\text{\"GAA\"}$.

The Coding DNA Sequence (CDS) starts at genomic position $g_1 = 1{,}000{,}000$. The genomic coordinate $g$ for a coding nucleotide at position $c_n$ on the positive strand is given by: $g = g_1 + c_n - 1$.\n\nThe VCF record is `chrom 7, pos 1,000,299, REF=CGAA, ALT=C`. This describes a deletion of the sequence \"GAA\" immediately following the reference base 'C' at position $1{,}000{,}299$. The deleted sequence \"GAA\" therefore spans genomic coordinates $1{,}000{,}300$ to $1{,}000{,}302$.\n\nTo find the corresponding `c.` coordinates for $\\mathrm{T1}$, we use the mapping: $c_n = g - g_1 + 1$.\nFor the start of the deletion at $g=1{,}000{,}300$: $c_{start} = 1{,}000{,}300 - 1{,}000{,}000 + 1 = 301$.\nFor the end of the deletion at $g=1{,}000{,}302$: $c_{end} = 1{,}000{,}302 - 1{,}000{,}000 + 1 = 303$.\nThe VCF record, which is left-aligned, corresponds to the HGVS notation `c.301_303del`.\n\nNext, we apply the HGVS 3'-rule. The problem states there is a homopolymeric tract of four \"GAA\" codons starting at `c.301`. The sequence is `(GAA)_4`, spanning nucleotides `c.301` through `c.312`. The rule requires shifting the description of the deletion to the most 3' position within this repeat. The last \"GAA\" unit in the repeat is at coordinates `c.310_c.312`. Therefore, the correct, normalized HGVS `c.` notation for the variant in transcript $\\mathrm{T1}$ is `c.310_c.312del`.\n\nTo determine the protein-level (`p.`) notation, we find the affected amino acid position. The amino acid position $p$ for a codon starting at nucleotide $c_{start}$ is given by $p = \\lceil \\frac{c_{start}}{3} \\rceil$.\nFor $\\mathrm{T1}$, the deletion is `c.310_c.312del`. The affected amino acid position is:\n$$p_1 = \\lceil \\frac{310}{3} \\rceil = \\lceil 103.33... \\rceil = 104$$\nThe codon \"GAA\" codes for Glutamate (Glu). Since an entire codon is deleted, the `p.` notation is `p.Glu104del`. The amino acid position for $\\mathrm{T1}$ is $p_1 = 104$.\n\n**Analysis for Transcript T2:**\nThe CDS for transcript $\\mathrm{T2}$ starts at genomic position $g_2 = 999{,}970$. This is $1{,}000{,}000 - 999{,}970 = 30$ base pairs upstream of the $\\mathrm{T1}$ start site. This means the CDS of $\\mathrm{T2}$ is $30$ nucleotides longer at its $5'$ end.\nConsequently, for any given genomic position, the `c.` coordinate in $\\mathrm{T2}$ will be $30$ greater than the corresponding `c.` coordinate in $\\mathrm{T1}$: $c_{\\mathrm{T2}} = c_{\\mathrm{T1}} + 30$.\n\nThe normalized deletion in $\\mathrm{T1}$ is `c.310_c.312del`. We translate these coordinates to the $\\mathrm{T2}$ system:\n$$c_{start, \\mathrm{T2}} = 310 + 30 = 340$$\n$$c_{end, \\mathrm{T2}} = 312 + 30 = 342$$\nThe correct, normalized HGVS `c.` notation for the variant in transcript $\\mathrm{T2}$ is `c.340_c.342del`.\n\nNow we determine the `p.` notation for $\\mathrm{T2}$. The affected amino acid position is:\n$$p_2 = \\lceil \\frac{c_{start, \\mathrm{T2}}}{3} \\rceil = \\lceil \\frac{340}{3} \\rceil = \\lceil 113.33... \\rceil = 114$$\nThe `p.` notation is `p.Glu114del`. The amino acid position for $\\mathrm{T2}$ is $p_2 = 114$. This is consistent with the fact that the protein encoded by $\\mathrm{T2}$ has an additional $30/3 = 10$ amino acids at its N-terminus compared to $\\mathrm{T1}$, so corresponding positions are shifted by $10$.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nThe problem asks for the absolute difference between the amino acid positions indicated by the two `p.` notations.\n- Amino acid position for $\\mathrm{T1}$: $p_1 = 104$.\n- Amino acid position for $\\mathrm{T2}$: $p_2 = 114$.\n\nThe absolute difference is:\n$$|p_2 - p_1| = |114 - 104| = 10$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "4327311"}]}
