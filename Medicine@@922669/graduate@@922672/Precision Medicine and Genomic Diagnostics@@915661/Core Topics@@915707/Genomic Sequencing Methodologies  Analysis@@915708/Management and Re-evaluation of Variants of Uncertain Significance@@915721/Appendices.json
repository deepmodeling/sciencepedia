This exercise provides direct practice in the core mechanics of this framework, demonstrating how to numerically update the probability of pathogenicity by combining a prior belief with new evidence expressed as likelihood ratios.

In this framework, the laboratory begins with a gene- and context-specific prior probability of pathogenicity $P_{\\text{prior}}$ and updates this belief using multiplicative likelihood ratios contributed by independent lines of evidence. The fundamental base includes: (i) Bayes’ theorem connecting prior and posterior beliefs via likelihood-based updating, (ii) the definition of odds $O$ as $O=\\frac{P}{1-P}$, and (iii) the conversion back from odds to probability as $P=\\frac{O}{1+O}$. The laboratory treats distinct evidence categories as conditionally independent for the purposes of aggregation.\n\nFor the VUS under review, the prior probability of pathogenicity is $P_{\\text{prior}}=0.10$. Newly acquired evidence comprises one strong pathogenic criterion (Pathogenic Strong, abbreviated as PS) with $LR_{PS}=18$, one moderate pathogenic criterion (Pathogenic Moderate, abbreviated as PM) with $LR_{PM}=4$, and one supporting benign criterion (Benign Supporting, abbreviated as BP) with $LR_{BP}=0.2$ acting to reduce the odds of pathogenicity. Assuming conditional independence of these evidence components, compute the posterior probability of pathogenicity $P_{\\text{post}}$ for this variant by appropriately converting between probability and odds, aggregating likelihood ratios, and then converting back to probability. Round your final numeric answer for $P_{\\text{post}}$ to $4$ significant figures and express it as a decimal (do not use a percentage sign).

The use of prior probabilities, likelihood ratios, and their multiplicative aggregation under the assumption of conditional independence is a cornerstone of this framework. The numerical values provided for the prior and likelihood ratios are plausible for their respective evidence categories.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary numerical values ($P_{\\text{prior}}$ and all relevant $LR$s) and a clear, unambiguous objective: to calculate the posterior probability of pathogenicity, $P_{\\text{post}}$. The steps for the calculation (conversion to odds, aggregation of evidence, conversion back to probability) are explicitly outlined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and objective language, free from subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. It explicitly states the simplifying assumption of conditional independence, which is necessary to perform the calculation as described. There are no contradictory constraints.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. A unique solution can be derived from the provided information and principles. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe solution involves a three-step process based on the Bayesian framework operating on odds rather than probabilities.\n\nFirst, we convert the given prior probability of pathogenicity, $P_{\\text{prior}}$, into prior odds, $O_{\\text{prior}}$. The relationship between probability $P$ and odds $O$ is given by $O = \\frac{P}{1-P}$.\nSubstituting the given value of $P_{\\text{prior}} = 0.10$:\n$$\nO_{\\text{prior}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{prior}}}{1 - P_{\\text{prior}}} = \\frac{0.10}{1 - 0.10} = \\frac{0.10}{0.90} = \\frac{1}{9}\n$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the combined likelihood ratio, $LR_{total}$, from the individual evidence components. The problem states that the evidence components are to be treated as conditionally independent. Therefore, the combined likelihood ratio is the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$\nLR_{total} = LR_{PS} \\times LR_{PM} \\times LR_{BP}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $LR_{PS} = 18$, $LR_{PM} = 4$, and $LR_{BP} = 0.2$:\n$$\nLR_{total} = 18 \\times 4 \\times 0.2 = 72 \\times 0.2 = 14.4\n$$\n\nThird, we update the prior odds to posterior odds, $O_{\\text{post}}$, by multiplying the prior odds by the combined likelihood ratio. This is the core of Bayesian updating in odds form.\n$$\nO_{\\text{post}} = O_{\\text{prior}} \\times LR_{total}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $O_{\\text{prior}}$ and $LR_{total}$:\n$$\nO_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{1}{9} \\times 14.4 = \\frac{14.4}{9} = 1.6\n$$\n\nFourth, we convert the posterior odds, $O_{\\text{post}}$, back into a posterior probability, $P_{\\text{post}}$. The relationship is given by $P = \\frac{O}{1+O}$.\n$$\nP_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{O_{\\text{post}}}{1 + O_{\\text{post}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated value for $O_{\\text{post}}$:\n$$\nP_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{1.6}{1 + 1.6} = \\frac{1.6}{2.6} = \\frac{16}{26} = \\frac{8}{13}\n$$\n\nTo provide the final numerical answer, we compute the decimal value of this fraction and round it to $4$ significant figures as requested.\n$$\nP_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{8}{13} \\approx 0.6153846...\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives $0.6154$.\n\nAs a final step for interpretation, we compare the computed $P_{\\text{post}}$ to the \"likely pathogenic\" threshold of $P_{\\text{post}} \\geq 0.90$. Our calculated value is $P_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.6154$. Since $0.6154  0.90$, the aggregated evidence is insufficient to classify this variant as \"likely pathogenic\". It strengthens the case for pathogenicity compared to the prior of $0.10$, but does not cross the required threshold. The variant would likely remain classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance, albeit with increased suspicion of pathogenicity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6154}\n$$", "id": "4356718"}, {"introduction": "Applying the ACMG/AMP criteria requires more than memorization; it demands a nuanced understanding of molecular biology and the evolving guidelines from expert groups like ClinGen. This practice focuses on the critical PVS1 (Pathogenic Very Strong 1) criterion for loss-of-function variants, challenging you to apply decision rules based on the variant's location and its predicted effect on nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). This scenario illustrates how re-evaluation based on refined, context-specific rules can lead to more accurate evidence weighting [@problem_id:4356742].", "problem": "A clinical laboratory is re-evaluating a truncating variant in a patient with a phenotype consistent with a disorder in which loss of function is a well-established disease mechanism for the implicated gene. The gene has a canonical protein-coding transcript of length $1{,}120$ amino acids. The variant is described as c.$3001$CT (p.Gln$1001$*), which lies in the last coding exon and introduces a premature termination codon at amino acid position $1{,}001$. Multiple lines of curated evidence support that this exon is constitutively included in the biologically relevant transcript and that loss of function is the primary mechanism for disease in this gene (for example, established haploinsufficiency in human disease and depletion of putative loss-of-function variants in population datasets).\n\nThe laboratory initially applied the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) criterion Pathogenic Very Strong $1$ (PVS$1$) at very strong strength because the variant is a nonsense change in a gene where loss of function is known to cause disease. However, the laboratory now applies gene- and exon-level decision rules as recommended by the Clinical Genome Resource Sequence Variant Interpretation working group.\n\nUse the following well-tested biological facts as the starting point:\n- By the Central Dogma, a premature termination codon can lead to either nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) or production of a truncated protein.\n- Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is generally expected when a premature termination codon occurs more than approximately $50$–$55$ nucleotides upstream of the final exon–exon junction; NMD is generally not expected for premature termination codons in the last coding exon or within approximately $50$ nucleotides of the penultimate exon–exon junction.\n- The strength level assigned to PVS$1$ depends on whether NMD is expected, whether the truncated region encompasses a critical functional domain, whether a substantial portion of the protein is removed, and whether alternative splicing or biological redundancy suggests tolerance to C-terminal truncation.\n\nAssume for this gene that:\n- The last coding exon contributes the C-terminal $120$ amino acids ($\\approx 10.7\\%$ of the protein) with no experimentally validated critical domain annotated in that region.\n- There is no evidence that C-terminal truncations in this gene are benign, but there is also no evidence of a specific essential motif in the last $120$ amino acids.\n- The exon is constitutive across disease-relevant transcripts; alternative splicing does not skip this exon.\n\nQuestion: Based on these facts and established PVS$1$ decision frameworks, which PVS$1$ strength is most appropriate for this variant upon re-evaluation, and why?\n\nChoose the single best option:\n\nA. Apply PVS$1$ at very strong strength because any nonsense variant in a loss-of-function disease gene warrants very strong evidence.\n\nB. Apply PVS$1$ at strong strength because the variant truncates a substantial portion of the protein even though NMD is not expected.\n\nC. Apply PVS$1$ at moderate strength because NMD is not expected for a last-exon truncation and, although approximately $10.7\\%$ of the protein is removed, there is no established critical domain in the truncated C-terminus.\n\nD. Do not apply PVS$1$ because last-exon truncating variants are generally benign.\n\nE. Apply PVS$1$ at supporting strength because any last-exon truncation should be minimally weighted regardless of the fraction of the protein removed.\n\nNote: Your reasoning should explicitly use the NMD rule-of-thumb and a quantitative assessment of the truncated proportion of the protein. Show how these first principles determine the downgrade from very strong to a lower strength level in an exon-level framework.", "solution": "The validity of the problem statement must first be established.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Gene's canonical protein length: $1{,}120$ amino acids.\n- Variant description: c.$3001$CT, leading to p.Gln$1001$*.\n- Variant type: Nonsense, introducing a premature termination codon (PTC) at residue $1{,}001$.\n- Variant location: Last coding exon.\n- Disease mechanism for the gene: Loss of function (LoF) is well-established.\n- Initial classification: Pathogenic Very Strong $1$ (PVS$1$) at very strong strength.\n- Re-evaluation framework: Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Sequence Variant Interpretation (SVI) working group recommendations.\n- NMD rule-of-thumb: NMD is generally not expected for PTCs in the last coding exon or within $\\approx 50$ nucleotides of the penultimate exon-exon junction.\n- PVS$1$ strength depends on: NMD expectation, critical domain truncation, proportion of protein removed, and other biological factors.\n- Gene-specific assumptions:\n    - The last coding exon encodes the C-terminal $120$ amino acids.\n    - No experimentally validated critical domain is in the C-terminal $120$ amino acids.\n    - No evidence exists that C-terminal truncations in this gene are benign.\n    - The exon is constitutive (not subject to alternative splicing in relevant transcripts).\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in established principles of molecular biology (nonsense-mediated decay), protein structure, and clinical genomics (ACMG/AMP/ClinGen variant interpretation guidelines). The PVS$1$ criterion and its decision-tree-based application are central to modern variant classification. The scenario is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a specific variant, a specific gene context, and a specific set of rules (the ClinGen PVS$1$ framework) to apply. All necessary information is provided to arrive at a single, logical conclusion within that framework.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in objective, technical language, free from subjectivity or bias.\n- **Consistency Check:** The length of the truncated portion can be calculated. The full-length protein has $1{,}120$ amino acids. The truncation occurs at position $1{,}001$, meaning residues $1{,}001$ through $1{,}120$ are lost. The number of lost amino acids is $1120 - 1001 + 1 = 120$. This perfectly matches the provided information that \"The last coding exon contributes the C-terminal $120$ amino acids\". The quantitative details are consistent. The description of the variant corresponds to a typical scenario encountered in diagnostic laboratories.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid, scientifically sound, internally consistent, and well-posed. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe task is to determine the appropriate strength for the PVS$1$ criterion for the variant p.Gln$1001$* in a gene of length $1{,}120$ amino acids, following modern ClinGen guidelines.\n\n1.  **Analyze NMD Expectation:** The problem states the variant, c.$3001$CT, lies in the last coding exon. The provided biological rule is: \"Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is generally not expected for premature termination codons in the last coding exon...\". Therefore, the mRNA transcript from the allele carrying this variant is predicted to escape NMD and be translated into a truncated protein. The primary mechanism of LoF via NMD is not operative here.\n\n2.  **Quantify the Truncation:** The full-length protein is $L_{total} = 1{,}120$ amino acids. The premature termination codon is at position $p_{PTC} = 1{,}001$. The resulting protein will have a length of $p_{PTC} - 1 = 1{,}000$ amino acids. The number of amino acids removed from the C-terminus is $L_{removed} = L_{total} - (p_{PTC} - 1) = 1120 - 1000 = 120$ amino acids. The fraction of the protein that is removed is:\n    $$\n    \\text{Fraction removed} = \\frac{L_{removed}}{L_{total}} = \\frac{120}{1120} \\approx 0.10714\n    $$\n    This corresponds to approximately $10.7\\%$ of the protein, which is consistent with the value provided in the problem statement.\n\n3.  **Apply the ClinGen PVS$1$ Decision Framework:** The strength of PVS$1$ is modulated based on several factors. The initial \"Very Strong\" level is the default for clear null variants in LoF genes, but it is adjusted based on specific conditions.\n    - **Condition 1 (NMD):** Since NMD is **not** expected, the PVS$1$ strength is immediately downgraded from \"Very Strong\". A \"Very Strong\" level is reserved for variants confidently predicted to undergo NMD (e.g., those upstream of the last exon-exon junction by more than $50$-$55$ nucleotides) that remove a significant portion ($10\\%$) of the protein.\n    - **Condition 2 (Impact of Truncation):** For variants that escape NMD, the impact of the resulting a truncated protein must be assessed. The ClinGen framework considers both the location/size of the truncation and the function of the removed region.\n        - If the truncation removes a known critical functional domain, PVS$1$ is typically applied at the \"Strong\" level. The problem states, \"...no experimentally validated critical domain annotated in that region.\" Thus, this condition for \"Strong\" is not met.\n        - If the truncation does not remove a known critical domain, the decision is based on the percentage of the protein that is removed. The framework often uses a threshold, typically around $10\\%$.\n            - Our calculation shows the truncation removes $\\approx 10.7\\%$ of the protein. This meets the condition for a substantial truncation ($\\ge 10\\%$).\n            - The ClinGen SVI guidelines specify that for a variant predicted to escape NMD that removes $\\ge 10\\%$ of the protein but does not impact a known critical functional domain, the appropriate strength for PVS$1$ is **Moderate**.\n            - If the truncation had removed $10\\%$ of the protein, the strength would be further downgraded to \"Supporting\".\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The variant p.Gln$1001$* is in the last coding exon, so NMD is not predicted. The resulting truncated protein is missing its C-terminal $120$ amino acids, which constitutes $\\approx 10.7\\%$ of the total length. This region does not contain a known critical functional domain. Based on the established, hierarchical PVS$1$ decision framework, these specific conditions warrant the application of PVS$1$ at the **Moderate** strength level.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Apply PVS$1$ at very strong strength because any nonsense variant in a loss-of-function disease gene warrants very strong evidence.**\nThis statement is an oversimplification and reflects an outdated application of the PVS$1$ rule. The entire premise of the re-evaluation using ClinGen guidelines is to introduce nuance. Specifically, a nonsense variant in the last exon that is predicted to escape NMD does not automatically qualify for \"Very Strong\" evidence.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Apply PVS$1$ at strong strength because the variant truncates a substantial portion of the protein even though NMD is not expected.**\nWhile the truncation is substantial ($\\approx 10.7\\%$), \"Strong\" evidence for a non-NMD-mediated truncation is typically justified only when the removed portion contains a known critical functional domain. The problem explicitly states this is not the case. Therefore, \"Strong\" is an overestimation of the evidence strength.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Apply PVS$1$ at moderate strength because NMD is not expected for a last-exon truncation and, although approximately $10.7\\%$ of the protein is removed, there is no established critical domain in the truncated C-terminus.**\nThis option correctly synthesizes all the key points from our derivation. It correctly identifies that NMD is not expected, correcly notes the percentage of protein removed ($\\approx 10.7\\%$, which is a significant portion), and correctly uses the fact that no critical domain is affected. This combination of factors is the precise rationale for applying PVS$1$ at the \"Moderate\" level according to the ClinGen framework.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**D. Do not apply PVS$1$ because last-exon truncating variants are generally benign.**\nThis is an incorrect generalization. While last-exon variants escape NMD, the resulting truncated protein can still be non-functional or unstable, representing a valid LoF mechanism. The PVS$1$ framework is designed to weigh this evidence, not discard it. The problem states there is no evidence of these truncations being benign for this gene. Therefore, PVS$1$ should be applied, albeit at a modulated strength.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Apply PVS$1$ at supporting strength because any last-exon truncation should be minimally weighted regardless of the fraction of the protein removed.**\nThis is incorrect. The ClinGen framework explicitly distinguishes between last-exon truncations based on the fraction of the protein removed. \"Supporting\" strength is generally reserved for truncations removing a smaller portion of the protein (e.g., $10\\%$). Since this variant removes $\\approx 10.7\\%$, \"Supporting\" is too weak. The weighting is modulated, not minimal.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4356742"}, {"introduction": "In clinical genomics, it is common to encounter conflicting evidence, particularly from computational prediction tools.

I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\n\nThe central task is to resolve a conflict between two computational predictors by evaluating the quality of evidence each provides. The laboratory's protocol explicitly allows for this evaluation based on two key criteria: predictor provenance and performance metrics.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Predictor Provenance**: Provenance refers to the origin and methodological rigor of the predictor's development and validation.\n    -   **MetaBenign-v$2$**: Its use of random $10$-fold cross-validation *without* gene-level stratification is a significant methodological flaw. This approach is known to cause data leakage, where variants from the same gene can be present in both training and testing sets, leading to optimistically inflated performance metrics. Furthermore, it is a \"general-purpose\" tool with \"no dominant-negative mechanism-specific calibration\". This lack of specialization is a major disadvantage when assessing a variant in a gene with a known, specific disease mechanism like dominant-negative effects.\n    -   **DN-Predictor**: Its provenance is far superior. It employed \"nested cross-validation with both time-splits ... and gene-level stratification\". This is a state-of-the-art methodology designed to prevent data leakage and provide a more realistic estimate of performance on novel data. Critically, it has been \"externally validated on an independent disease registry,\" which is the gold standard for assessing a model's generalizability. Finally, it is \"gene-mechanism specific,\" meaning it is explicitly designed to recognize the features relevant to the dominant-negative mechanism in question.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Predictor Performance**: The performance metrics provided allow for a direct quantitative comparison.\n    -   **Sensitivity ($Se$) and Specificity ($Sp$)**:\n        -   MetaBenign-v$2$: $Se_1=0.55$, $Sp_1=0.85$. The sensitivity is alarmingly low, indicating that this tool correctly identifies only $55\\%$ of true pathogenic variants in this context. It has a high false-negative rate of $1 - Se_1 = 0.45$.\n        -   DN-Predictor$: $Se_2=0.80$, $Sp_2=0.90$. Both sensitivity and specificity are substantially higher than those of MetaBenign-v$2$.\n    -   **Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC)**:\n        -   The AUROC is a summary measure of a classifier's performance across all possible classification thresholds. A value of $1.0$ is perfect, while $0.5$ is equivalent to random guessing.\n        -   In the relevant context, DN-Predictor achieves an AUROC of $0.92$ (\"excellent\" discrimination), while MetaBenign-v$2$ achieves an AUROC of $0.78$ (\"acceptable\" but clearly inferior discrimination). This confirms that DN-Predictor is fundamentally a more powerful and accurate classifier for this specific problem.\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Conclusion**:\n    The evidence is unequivocal. DN-Predictor is superior to MetaBenign-v$2$ on every relevant axis:\n    -   **Methodological Rigor (Provenance)**: DN-Predictor uses robust validation techniques (time-split, gene stratification, external validation) that prevent common pitfalls like data leakage. MetaBenign-v$2$ does not.\n    -   **Scientific Relevance (Mechanism Alignment)**: DN-Predictor is specifically tailored to the dominant-negative mechanism, while MetaBenign-v$2$ is not.\n    -   **Quantitative Performance**: DN-Predictor has higher sensitivity, higher specificity, and a much higher AUROC.\n\nGiven the laboratory's protocol, which prioritizes provenance and performance, the scientifically justified action is to trust the prediction from the superior tool (DN-Predictor) and discard the prediction from the inferior, methodologically flawed tool (MetaBenign-v$2$). Therefore, the pathogenic signal (PP3) from DN-Predictor should be applied, and the benign signal (BP4) from MetaBenign-v$2$ should be withheld.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Apply BP4 from MetaBenign-v$2$ and disregard PP3, because the meta-predictor provides a stronger “rule-out” due to its benign threshold, and the presence of any benign computational signal should supersede pathogenic computational signals in conflicts.**\nThis is incorrect. The assertion that a benign signal supersedes a pathogenic one is not a valid scientific principle; decisions must be based on evidence quality. MetaBenign-v$2$ does *not* provide a strong \"rule-out\" capability; its very low sensitivity of $Se_1=0.55$ means it fails to identify $45\\%$ of pathogenic variants, making it unreliable for ruling out pathogenicity. Trusting the demonstrably inferior tool is not a defensible strategy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. Apply PP3 from DN-Predictor and do not apply BP4, because the mechanism-aligned predictor has higher validated performance, better provenance (time-split and gene-level leakage control, external validation, mechanism-specific calibration), and its quantitative operating characteristics support pathogenic evidence at the supporting level.**\nThis option correctly synthesizes the analysis. It identifies the superior provenance (validation methodology, mechanism alignment) and performance (higher $Se$, $Sp$, and AUROC) of the DN-Predictor. Based on these objective criteria, it concludes that the evidence from DN-Predictor should be applied (PP3) and the conflicting, lower-quality evidence from MetaBenign-v$2$ should be disregarded (do not apply BP4). This approach aligns perfectly with the principles of evidence-based practice and the laboratory's stated protocol.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Apply neither PP3 nor BP4 and proceed with non-computational evidence only, because any conflict among computational tools requires zero-weighting computational codes by default under ACMG/AMP.**\nThis is an overly simplistic and outdated interpretation. While it might be a fallback position in the absence of further information, modern best practices and the lab's explicit protocol call for a critical evaluation of the conflicting evidence sources. Discarding a high-quality, validated piece of evidence (from DN-Predictor) simply because a low-quality tool gives a conflicting result is a failure to properly weigh evidence. It is not the most scientifically justified approach when a clear hierarchy of evidence quality exists.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Average the raw scores ($0.15$ and $0.87$) to obtain $0.51$, treat the result as borderline, and withhold both PP3 and BP4 while documenting the averaged score as part of the report.**\nThis is methodologically unsound. The output scores of different machine learning models are not on a commensurate scale and cannot be naively averaged. Doing so implicitly gives equal weight to a high-quality prediction and a low-quality prediction. This is analogous to averaging a measurement from a precise, calibrated instrument with one from a faulty, uncalibrated instrument. The result ($0.51$) is meaningless.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Apply both PP3 and BP4 to acknowledge the presence of mixed computational signals and let them cancel out in the overall classification without further scrutiny of provenance or performance.**\nThis is incorrect for the same reason as option C. It treats high-quality and low-quality evidence as equal. In the ACMG/AMP framework, applying one supporting pathogenic (PP3) and one supporting benign (BP4) code results in a net neutral impact on the final classification. This approach actively ignores the \"scrutiny of provenance or performance\" that is essential for a rigorous scientific process and explicitly sanctioned by the laboratory's protocol. It is an evasion of the critical thinking required by the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4356747"}]}
