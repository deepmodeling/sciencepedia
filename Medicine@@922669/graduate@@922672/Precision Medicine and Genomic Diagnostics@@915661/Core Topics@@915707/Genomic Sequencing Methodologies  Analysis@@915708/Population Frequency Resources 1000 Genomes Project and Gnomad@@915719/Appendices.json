The concepts of allele count ($AC$), allele number ($AN$), and allele frequency ($AF$) are standard, and their calculation from genotype counts is a routine and valid scientific procedure. The context of large-scale genomic databases like gnomAD is entirely appropriate.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (genotype counts) to compute the requested quantities. The instructions are unambiguous, leading to a single, unique, and meaningful solution.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and objective language. It is free from subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or infeasibility. It is a straightforward application of established principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be constructed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe allele frequency ($AF$) of a specific allele in a population is defined as the ratio of the total count of that allele (the Allele Count, $AC$) to the total number of all alleles at that locus in the population (the Allele Number, $AN$).\n\n$$\nAF_a = \\frac{AC_a}{AN}\n$$\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of individuals ($N$) in the cohort by summing the counts for each genotype:\n$$\nN = n_{AA} + n_{Aa} + n_{aa}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nN = 9328 + 660 + 12 = 10000\n$$\nThe cohort consists of $10000$ diploid individuals.\n\nNext, we calculate the Allele Number ($AN$). Since each diploid individual has two alleles at any given autosomal locus and all genotype calls are complete, the total number of alleles in the cohort is twice the number of individuals:\n$$\nAN = 2 \\times N = 2 \\times 10000 = 20000\n$$\n\nNow, we calculate the Allele Count ($AC_a$) for the alternate allele $a$. This is the sum of all copies of allele $a$ across all individuals.\n-   Individuals with genotype $AA$ contribute $0$ copies of allele $a$.\n-   Individuals with genotype $Aa$ contribute $1$ copy of allele $a$.\n-   Individuals with genotype $aa$ contribute $2$ copies of allele $a$.\n\nThe total count for allele $a$ is therefore:\n$$\nAC_a = (0 \\times n_{AA}) + (1 \\times n_{Aa}) + (2 \\times n_{aa})\n$$\n$$\nAC_a = n_{Aa} + 2 \\times n_{aa}\n$$\nSubstituting the given genotype counts:\n$$\nAC_a = 660 + (2 \\times 12) = 660 + 24 = 684\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the allele frequency for allele $a$ ($AF_a$):\n$$\nAF_a = \\frac{AC_a}{AN} = \\frac{684}{20000}\n$$\n$$\nAF_a = 0.0342\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be reported as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.

A primary application is testing whether a cohort's observed genotype frequencies match the predictions of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). This practice challenges you to apply the HWE principle to a realistic, admixed population by first calculating an ancestry-weighted allele frequency and then using a chi-square test to assess deviation, a key quality control step in variant analysis.", "problem": "A clinical genetics laboratory is assessing whether a rare single-nucleotide variant observed in a cohort is consistent with Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) under an allele frequency appropriate for the cohort’s ancestry composition. The variant has ancestry-stratified alternate-allele frequencies reported by the 1000 Genomes Project (1KG) as follows: African ancestry: $p_{\\mathrm{AFR}} = 0.0070$, European ancestry: $p_{\\mathrm{EUR}} = 0.0030$, and East Asian ancestry: $p_{\\mathrm{EAS}} = 0.0012$. The cohort’s ancestry proportions (estimated by principal components matched to 1KG reference panels) are: $w_{\\mathrm{AFR}} = 0.30$, $w_{\\mathrm{EUR}} = 0.50$, and $w_{\\mathrm{EAS}} = 0.20$. The global alternate-allele frequency in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) is $p_{\\mathrm{gnomAD}} = 0.0041$, but you should use the ancestry-weighted frequency derived from 1KG for the expectation in this cohort because the cohort’s ancestry composition differs from the gnomAD global composition.\n\nAssume a large, randomly mating population with no selection, mutation, migration, or genotyping error, and independence of alleles contributed by each parent. Under these assumptions, derive from first principles the expected genotype probabilities for a biallelic locus with alternate-allele frequency $p$ and reference-allele frequency $1-p$, and then obtain the expected genotype counts for a sample of $N$ unrelated individuals.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of population genetics, specifically Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), and uses realistic data and standard statistical methods. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary data and constraints provided consistently and without contradiction.\n\nThe first step is to derive the expected genotype probabilities under HWE from first principles, as requested. For a biallelic locus with an alternate allele, which we will denote as $A$, and a reference allele, $a$, let their frequencies in the population's gene pool be $p$ and $q$, respectively. As these are the only two alleles at this locus, their frequencies must sum to $1$:\n$$ p + q = 1 $$\nThis implies $q = 1 - p$. The Hardy-Weinberg principle assumes a large, randomly mating population where evolutionary forces such as selection, mutation, and migration are absent. Under these conditions, the genotype frequencies in the next generation are determined by the random union of gametes. The probability of an individual's genotype is the product of the frequencies of the alleles they inherit.\n\nThe probability of an individual being homozygous for the alternate allele ($AA$) is the probability of inheriting allele $A$ from both parents, which is:\n$$ P(AA) = p \\times p = p^2 $$\nThe probability of an individual being homozygous for the reference allele ($aa$) is the probability of inheriting allele $a$ from both parents:\n$$ P(aa) = q \\times q = q^2 = (1-p)^2 $$\nThe probability of an individual being heterozygous ($Aa$) can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: inheriting $A$ from the first parent and $a$ from the second ($p \\times q$), or inheriting $a$ from the first parent and $A$ from the second ($q \\times p$). Therefore, the total probability is:\n$$ P(Aa) = (p \\times q) + (q \\times p) = 2pq = 2p(1-p) $$\nThe sum of these three genotype probabilities must equal $1$, which serves as a consistency check: $P(AA) + P(Aa) + P(aa) = p^2 + 2p(1-p) + (1-p)^2 = (p + (1-p))^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n\nNext, we must calculate the appropriate alternate-allele frequency, $p$, for the cohort. This is an ancestry-weighted average of the frequencies from the 1000 Genomes Project reference populations, given by the formula $p = \\sum_{k} w_{k} p_{k}$. Using the provided ancestry proportions ($w_k$) and ancestry-specific allele frequencies ($p_k$):\n$$ p = w_{\\mathrm{AFR}} p_{\\mathrm{AFR}} + w_{\\mathrm{EUR}} p_{\\mathrm{EUR}} + w_{\\mathrm{EAS}} p_{\\mathrm{EAS}} $$\n$$ p = (0.30)(0.0070) + (0.50)(0.0030) + (0.20)(0.0012) $$\n$$ p = 0.0021 + 0.0015 + 0.00024 = 0.00384 $$\nThe corresponding frequency of the reference allele, $q$, is:\n$$ q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.00384 = 0.99616 $$\n\nWith the cohort-specific allele frequency established, we can calculate the expected genotype counts ($n_{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{exp}}$) for the sample of $N = 4000$ unrelated individuals. The expected count for each genotype is the total sample size multiplied by the genotype's HWE probability.\nExpected count of homozygous alternate ($AA$):\n$$ n_{AA}^{\\mathrm{exp}} = N \\times P(AA) = N \\times p^2 = 4000 \\times (0.00384)^2 = 4000 \\times 0.0000147456 = 0.0589824 $$\nExpected count of heterozygous ($Aa$):\n$$ n_{Aa}^{\\mathrm{exp}} = N \\times P(Aa) = N \\times 2pq = 4000 \\times 2 \\times 0.00384 \\times 0.99616 = 30.5981312 $$\nExpected count of homozygous reference ($aa$):\n$$ n_{aa}^{\\mathrm{exp}} = N \\times P(aa) = N \\times q^2 = 4000 \\times (0.99616)^2 = 3969.3428864 $$\nThe sum of the expected counts is $0.0589824 + 30.5981312 + 3969.3428864 = 4000$, which matches the total cohort size $N$.\n\nFinally, we compute the Pearson chi-square goodness-of-fit statistic, $X^2$, using the observed genotype counts ($n_{AA}^{\\mathrm{obs}} = 1$, $n_{Aa}^{\\mathrm{obs}} = 42$, $n_{aa}^{\\mathrm{obs}} = 3957$) and the expected counts just calculated.\n$$ X^{2} \\;=\\; \\sum_{\\gamma \\in \\{AA,\\,Aa,\\,aa\\}} \\frac{\\big(n_{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{obs}} - n_{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{exp}}\\big)^{2}}{n_{\\gamma}^{\\mathrm{exp}}} $$\nThe calculation proceeds term by term:\n$$ X^{2} = \\frac{(n_{AA}^{\\mathrm{obs}} - n_{AA}^{\\mathrm{exp}})^2}{n_{AA}^{\\mathrm{exp}}} + \\frac{(n_{Aa}^{\\mathrm{obs}} - n_{Aa}^{\\mathrm{exp}})^2}{n_{Aa}^{\\mathrm{exp}}} + \\frac{(n_{aa}^{\\mathrm{obs}} - n_{aa}^{\\mathrm{exp}})^2}{n_{aa}^{\\mathrm{exp}}} $$\n$$ X^{2} = \\frac{(1 - 0.0589824)^{2}}{0.0589824} + \\frac{(42 - 30.5981312)^{2}}{30.5981312} + \\frac{(3957 - 3969.3428864)^{2}}{3969.3428864} $$\n$$ X^{2} = \\frac{(0.9410176)^{2}}{0.0589824} + \\frac{(11.4018688)^{2}}{30.5981312} + \\frac{(-12.3428864)^{2}}{3969.3428864} $$\n$$ X^{2} = \\frac{0.8855139...}{0.0589824} + \\frac{130.00261...}{30.5981312} + \\frac{152.34680...}{3969.3428864} $$\n$$ X^{2} \\approx 15.013143 + 4.248744 + 0.038381 $$\n$$ X^{2} \\approx 19.300268 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested, yields $19.30$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{19.30}\n$$", "id": "4370211"}, {"introduction": "Population frequency databases aggregate data from different studies, often using different technologies like whole-exome versus whole-genome sequencing.

The analyst compares results from the One Thousand Genomes Project ($1000$G) and the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). The following scientifically plausible facts are observed:\n\n- The One Thousand Genomes Project ($1000$G) sequenced primarily whole genomes at low coverage (mean depth approximately $7\\times$) and includes globally diverse populations. In a cohort of $N_{1000G}=2504$ individuals, the variant has observed allele count $AC_{1000G}=300$, yielding allele frequency $f_{1000G}=\\frac{AC_{1000G}}{2N_{1000G}}=\\frac{300}{2\\times 2504}\\approx 0.060$.\n- The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) contains both exome and genome data, but the exome dataset is much larger. In the gnomAD exome dataset, the locus $L$ lies outside standard capture baits, and empirical coverage shows that only a fraction $p_{c}$ of samples have callable depth at $L$, with $p_{c}\\approx 0.08$. In $N_{e}=125000$ exome samples, only $p_{c}N_{e}=0.08\\times 125000=10000$ samples have callable data at $L$. The observed exome allele count is $AC_{e}=2$, giving $f_{e}=\\frac{AC_{e}}{2p_{c}N_{e}}=\\frac{2}{2\\times 10000}=0.0001$.\n- In the gnomAD genome subset, which is smaller ($N_{g}=15000$ individuals) and sequenced at higher depth (mean $\\sim 30\\times$), the variant is observed with $AC_{g}=1800$, giving $f_{g}=\\frac{1800}{2\\times 15000}=0.060$. The variant is labeled as high quality (filter status “PASS”) in both $1000$G and gnomAD genomes, and a coordinate check shows consistent mapping to Genome Reference Consortium Human build $37$ (GRCh$37$) and build $38$ (GRCh$38$) after liftover.\n- Population annotations indicate that the variant is enriched in an African subpopulation with per-population allele frequency $f_{\\mathrm{AFR}}\\approx 0.10$ and is near zero elsewhere. The African sample fractions are approximately $q_{1000G,\\mathrm{AFR}}\\approx 0.30$ in $1000$G and $q_{\\mathrm{gnomAD},\\mathrm{AFR}}\\approx 0.10$ in gnomAD.\n\nFundamental definitions and assumptions to use:\n- Allele frequency $f$ is defined as $f=\\frac{AC}{2N_{\\mathrm{callable}}}$, where $AC$ is allele count and $N_{\\mathrm{callable}}$ is the number of individuals with callable genotypes at the locus.\n- Under random sampling within a population with true frequency $f^{\\ast}$, the allele count $AC$ among $2N_{\\mathrm{callable}}$ chromosomes is well-approximated by a binomial distribution with parameters $n=2N_{\\mathrm{callable}}$ and success probability $f^{\\ast}$.\n- In an ancestry mixture, the expected overall frequency is the weighted sum $f_{\\mathrm{mix}}=\\sum_{k} q_{k} f_{k}$, where $q_{k}$ are ancestry proportions and $f_{k}$ are ancestry-specific frequencies.\n- Coverage and assay scope directly affect $N_{\\mathrm{callable}}$ and thus the ability to observe the variant.\n\nQuestion: Given the observations above, which explanation is most plausible for why the variant appears common in $1000$G but rare in gnomAD if an analyst naively consults gnomAD “overall” exome frequencies without checking the genome subset?\n\nA.

Coverage and assay scope differences (whole-genome versus exome capture) at locus $L$ are the primary cause of the discrepancy.\n\nC. Variant-calling pipeline differences (e.g., joint calling versus single-sample calling) between $1000$G and gnomAD are the primary cause of the discrepancy.\n\nD. Reference assembly mismatch (Genome Reference Consortium Human build $37$ versus build $38$) causing liftover errors is the primary cause of the discrepancy.\n\nSelect the single best answer based on first-principles reasoning using the definitions above and the provided data.", "solution": "The problem statement is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, well-posed, and objective. It presents a realistic scenario in genomic data analysis and provides sufficient, relevant information to arrive at a logical conclusion.\n\nThe core task is to determine the most plausible reason for a large discrepancy in the reported allele frequency of a single-nucleotide variant at locus $L$. The variant appears common in the $1000$ Genomes Project ($1000$G) dataset ($f_{1000G} \\approx 0.060$) but extremely rare in the gnomAD exome dataset ($f_{e} = 0.0001$). However, in the gnomAD whole-genome subset, its frequency is $f_{g} = 0.060$, consistent with the $1000$G data.\n\nLet us analyze the potential causes presented in the options.\n\nThe discrepancy to be explained is the difference between the frequency observed in $1000$G ($f_{1000G} \\approx 0.060$) and the frequency naively observed in the gnomAD exome dataset ($f_{e} = 0.0001$). The ratio of these frequencies is $\\frac{f_{1000G}}{f_{e}} \\approx \\frac{0.060}{0.0001} = 600$. This represents a $600$-fold difference that requires a strong explanatory factor.\n\nA key piece of information is that two independent whole-genome sequencing (WGS) datasets ($1000$G and gnomAD genomes) report a consistent allele frequency of approximately $0.060$.\n- In $1000$G (WGS): $f_{1000G} = \\frac{300}{2 \\times 2504} \\approx 0.0599$\n- In gnomAD genomes (WGS): $f_{g} = \\frac{1800}{2 \\times 15000} = 0.060$\nThis strongly suggests that the true allele frequency of the variant in a typical mixed population is around $6\\%$. The anomaly is therefore specific to the gnomAD exome dataset.\n\n**Option A: Sampling frame differences (ancestry composition)**\n\nThis option suggests that the difference in the proportion of various ancestries between the $1000$G and gnomAD cohorts explains the frequency discrepancy. We can test this hypothesis using the provided mixture model, $f_{\\mathrm{mix}}=\\sum_{k} q_{k} f_{k}$.\nThe problem states the variant is primarily found in an African subpopulation with frequency $f_{\\mathrm{AFR}}\\approx 0.10$ and is near zero in other populations. The African sample fractions are given as $q_{1000G,\\mathrm{AFR}}\\approx 0.30$ for $1000$G and $q_{\\mathrm{gnomAD},\\mathrm{AFR}}\\approx 0.10$ for gnomAD.\n\n- Expected frequency in $1000$G: $f_{\\mathrm{mix},1000G} \\approx q_{1000G,\\mathrm{AFR}} \\times f_{\\mathrm{AFR}} \\approx 0.30 \\times 0.10 = 0.03$.\n- Expected frequency in gnomAD: $f_{\\mathrm{mix},gnomAD} \\approx q_{\\mathrm{gnomAD},\\mathrm{AFR}} \\times f_{\\mathrm{AFR}} \\approx 0.10 \\times 0.10 = 0.01$.\n\nThe ratio of expected frequencies due to ancestry difference is $\\frac{f_{\\mathrm{mix},1000G}}{f_{\\mathrm{mix},gnomAD}} \\approx \\frac{0.03}{0.01} = 3$. While ancestry composition does contribute to a difference, it can only account for approximately a $3$-fold change in frequency. This is two orders of magnitude smaller than the observed $600$-fold discrepancy. Therefore, sampling frame differences are not sufficient to be the primary cause.\n\n*Verdict for A*: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option B: Coverage and assay scope differences (whole-genome versus exome capture)**\n\nThis option points to the difference in sequencing technology. The locus $L$ is in an intronic region. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) uses \"capture baits\" to selectively sequence exons (the protein-coding regions of genes), largely ignoring introns. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS), by contrast, sequences the entire genome, including introns.\n\nThe problem explicitly states:\n1.  The locus $L$ is intronic.\n2.  In the gnomAD exome dataset, $L$ \"lies outside standard capture baits\".\n3.  This results in a very low callable fraction of samples at this locus: $p_{c} \\approx 0.08$. This means that for $92\\%$ of the individuals in the gnomAD exome cohort, there is no reliable data at locus $L$.\n\nThe number of individuals with usable data at locus $L$ in the gnomAD exome dataset is only $N_{\\mathrm{callable}, e} = p_{c}N_{e} = 0.08 \\times 125000 = 10000$. Within this small fraction of the cohort, a very low allele count of $AC_{e}=2$ was observed, leading to the calculated frequency $f_{e} = \\frac{2}{2 \\times 10000} = 0.0001$.\n\nThe extremely low allele count ($AC_{e}=2$) despite having $10000$ \"callable\" individuals is itself a strong indicator of a technical artifact. If the true frequency were $0.06$, we would expect to see approximately $AC = f \\times 2N_{\\mathrm{callable}} = 0.06 \\times 2 \\times 10000 = 1200$ alleles. The observation of only $2$ alleles suggests that even in the \"callable\" samples, the data quality was likely very poor, leading to systematic miscalling of heterozygous individuals as homozygous reference.\n\nThe fact that the gnomAD *genome* dataset, which uses WGS and has uniform coverage over the intron, recovers the frequency $f_{g}=0.060$ confirms that the issue is not with the gnomAD project as a whole, but specifically with the gnomAD *exome* assay's ability to sequence this intronic locus. This is a direct consequence of the assay scope (WES) and its resulting poor coverage at the locus. This explanation fully accounts for the massive discrepancy.\n\n*Verdict for B*: **Correct**.\n\n**Option C: Variant-calling pipeline differences**\n\nThis option suggests that differences in the bioinformatics software used to identify variants are the primary cause. However, the problem states that the variant has a filter status of \"PASS\" (i.e., it is considered high quality) in both the $1000$G WGS data and the gnomAD WGS data. This indicates that when the underlying sequencing data is of good quality (as provided by WGS), the variant calling pipelines of both projects are capable of correctly identifying the variant. The failure to detect the variant properly is confined to the exome dataset, where the input data quality (coverage) is known to be poor at this specific locus. The behavior of the variant caller is secondary to the quality of the data it receives. Therefore, the root cause is the poor data quality resulting from the assay scope, not the pipeline itself.\n\n*Verdict for C*: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D: Reference assembly mismatch (GRCh$37$ versus GRCh$38$)**\n\nThis option suggests errors in converting genomic coordinates between different versions of the human reference genome. Such \"liftover\" errors can indeed be a source of discrepancy. However, the problem statement explicitly invalidates this explanation: \"a coordinate check shows consistent mapping to Genome Reference Consortium Human build $37$ (GRCh$37$) and build $38$ (GRCh$38$) after liftover.\" This confirms that the variant's location is correctly identified in both reference assemblies, ruling out liftover error as the cause.\n\n*Verdict for D*: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, the most plausible and primary explanation for the $600$-fold discrepancy in allele frequency is the fundamental difference in assay scope between whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing for an intronic variant. WES is not designed to cover introns, leading to extremely poor data quality and a drastically underestimated allele frequency. This is corroborated by the consistent, higher frequency found in two independent WGS datasets.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4370200"}]}
