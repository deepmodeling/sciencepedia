Generation I consists of two unrelated, non-inbred founders, a grandfather $G_f$ and a grandmother $G_m$. Generation II contains their two children, an uncle $U$ and a parent $P$. Generation III contains a niece $N$, who is the biological child of $P$ and an unrelated, non-inbred spouse $S$. Assume the following foundational rules: (i) Mendelian segregation in each meiosis transmits one of two alleles with probability $1/2$, (ii) founders’ homologous alleles are distinct lineages under the identity-by-descent framework, (iii) there is no selection, mutation, or linkage affecting transmission probabilities across the described paths, and (iv) all founders are mutually unrelated and non-inbred, making identity-by-descent contributions via distinct founders mutually exclusive.\n\nStarting from the definition that identity by descent (IBD) refers to two alleles being copies of the same ancestral allele and that the kinship coefficient $\\phi_{XY}$ is the probability that one allele sampled at random from individual $X$ and one allele sampled at random from individual $Y$ are IBD, derive the coefficient of relationship $r_{UN}$ between the uncle $U$ and niece $N$ by summing the path contributions through all shared ancestors in Generation I, using only the fundamental $1/2$ transmission rule and the requirement that both sampled alleles trace back to the same specific allele in the founder.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Mendelian genetics and quantitative genetics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and expressed in objective, formal language. The problem requires the derivation of the coefficient of relationship between an uncle and his niece from first principles.\n\nThe problem defines the kinship coefficient, $\\phi_{XY}$, as the probability that one allele sampled at random from individual $X$ and one allele sampled at random from individual $Y$ are identical by descent (IBD). The coefficient of relationship, $r_{XY}$, is defined for non-inbred individuals as twice the kinship coefficient: $r_{XY} = 2\\phi_{XY}$. We must first verify that the individuals in question, the uncle $U$ and the niece $N$, are non-inbred. The inbreeding coefficient of an individual is the kinship coefficient of their parents. The parents of $U$ are the founders $G_f$ and $G_m$, who are stated to be unrelated, so $\\phi_{G_f G_m} = 0$. Therefore, the inbreeding coefficient of $U$ is $F_U = 0$. The parents of $N$ are $P$ and $S$. $P$ is a child of $G_f$ and $G_m$, so $P$ is also non-inbred ($F_P = \\phi_{G_f G_m} = 0$). $S$ is stated to be an unrelated, non-inbred spouse. Since $P$ and $S$ are unrelated, their kinship coefficient is $\\phi_{PS} = 0$. Therefore, the inbreeding coefficient of $N$ is $F_N = \\phi_{PS} = 0$. Since both $U$ and $N$ are non-inbred, the relationship $r_{UN} = 2\\phi_{UN}$ holds.\n\nOur primary task is to calculate $\\phi_{UN}$ by summing the contributions from all paths through shared ancestors, using only fundamental transmission probabilities.\n\nThe shared ancestors of $U$ and $N$ are the grandfather $G_f$ and the grandmother $G_m$. An allele from $U$ and an allele from $N$ can be IBD only if they are copies of an allele from one of these common ancestors. Since $G_f$ and $G_m$ are unrelated, the events of two alleles being IBD via $G_f$ and being IBD via $G_m$ are mutually exclusive. Thus, we can write the total probability as the sum of probabilities for each ancestral path:\n$$\n\\phi_{UN} = P(A_U \\equiv A_N) = P(A_U \\equiv A_N \\text{ via } G_f) + P(A_U \\equiv A_N \\text{ via } G_m)\n$$\nwhere $A_U$ and $A_N$ are alleles sampled at random from $U$ and $N$, respectively, and $\\equiv$ denotes identity by descent.\n\nLet us first calculate the probability of IBD through the grandfather, $G_f$. Let the two homologous alleles of $G_f$ be $g_{f1}$ and $g_{f2}$. Since $G_f$ is non-inbred, $g_{f1}$ and $g_{f2}$ are not IBD. For $A_U$ and $A_N$ to be IBD via $G_f$, they must both be copies of $g_{f1}$ or both be copies of $g_{f2}$. These are mutually exclusive events.\n$$\nP(A_U \\equiv A_N \\text{ via } G_f) = P(A_U \\equiv g_{f1} \\text{ and } A_N \\equiv g_{f1}) + P(A_U \\equiv g_{f2} \\text{ and } A_N \\equiv g_{f2})\n$$\nSince the meiotic events leading to $U$ and $P$ (and subsequently $N$) are independent, we can separate the probabilities:\n$$\nP(A_U \\equiv A_N \\text{ via } G_f) = P(A_U \\equiv g_{f1})P(A_N \\equiv g_{f1}) + P(A_U \\equiv g_{f2})P(A_N \\equiv g_{f2})\n$$\n\nNow, we must find the probability that a random allele from a descendant is a copy of a specific allele from an ancestor.\n1.  For the uncle $U$: An allele is sampled at random from $U$. The probability of sampling the allele that $U$ inherited from $G_f$ is $1/2$. The probability that this inherited allele is a copy of the specific allele $g_{f1}$ is $1/2$, due to Mendelian segregation. These two steps are independent. Thus, the probability that a randomly sampled allele from $U$ is a copy of $g_{f1}$ is:\n    $$\n    P(A_U \\equiv g_{f1}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\n    $$\n2.  For the niece $N$: An allele is sampled at random from $N$. The probability it came from parent $P$ is $1/2$ (the other parent $S$ is not in the lineage from $G_f$). Given it came from $P$, the probability this allele is a copy of the one $P$ inherited from $G_f$ is $1/2$. Given that, the probability this allele is a copy of the specific allele $g_{f1}$ in $G_f$ is $1/2$. The path of transmission is $G_f \\to P \\to N$. The total probability is the product of probabilities at each independent step:\n    $$\n    P(A_N \\equiv g_{f1}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}\n    $$\n\nNow substitute these probabilities back. The probability for both alleles to be copies of $g_{f1}$ is:\n$$\nP(A_U \\equiv g_{f1})P(A_N \\equiv g_{f1}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{32}\n$$\nBy symmetry, the probability for both to be copies of the other allele, $g_{f2}$, is the same:\n$$\nP(A_U \\equiv g_{f2})P(A_N \\equiv g_{f2}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{32}\n$$\nThe total probability of IBD via $G_f$ is the sum of these two mutually exclusive possibilities:\n$$\nP(A_U \\equiv A_N \\text{ via } G_f) = \\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{1}{32} = \\frac{2}{32} = \\frac{1}{16}\n$$\n\nThe pedigree structure is symmetric with respect to the two founders, $G_f$ and $G_m$. Therefore, the calculation for the path through the grandmother $G_m$ is identical:\n$$\nP(A_U \\equiv A_N \\text{ via } G_m) = \\frac{1}{16}\n$$\n\nThe total kinship coefficient $\\phi_{UN}$ is the sum of the probabilities of IBD from all common ancestors:\n$$\n\\phi_{UN} = P(A_U \\equiv A_N \\text{ via } G_f) + P(A_U \\equiv A_N \\text{ via } G_m) = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the coefficient of relationship $r_{UN}$ using the established formula for non-inbred individuals:\n$$\nr_{UN} = 2\\phi_{UN} = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nThis derived value of $1/4$ is equal to $0.25$, which verifies the result as requested by the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}\n$$", "id": "4367046"}, {"introduction": "The concept of genetic relatedness has profound implications for predicting disease risk, especially in families with consanguineous unions.

The coefficient of inbreeding of an individual is defined as the probability that the two alleles at a given locus in that individual are identical by descent (IBD). A fundamental principle in pedigree analysis is that the coefficient of inbreeding of an individual is equal to the coefficient of kinship of their parents. The coefficient of kinship, $\\phi(I, J)$, between two individuals $I$ and $J$ is the probability that an allele chosen at random from $I$ and an allele chosen at random from $J$ at the same locus are IBD.\n\nTherefore, for the two scenarios, we must compute:\n1. $F_X = \\phi(C, D)$ for Scenario 1.\n2. $F_Y = \\phi(D, E)$ for Scenario 2.\n\nWe are given that the founders $P$, $Q$, $S_1$, and $S_2$ are non-inbred and mutually unrelated.
