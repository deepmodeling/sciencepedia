To estimate the baseline burden in an unselected newborn population under routine care (before genome sequencing is employed), the center wishes to compute the expected disease prevalence under the following assumptions: random mating, large population size, no selection, no mutation, no migration, and complete (full) penetrance for individuals with two pathogenic alleles. Let the pathogenic allele frequency be $q = 0.001$ in this population, and let $p$ denote the frequency of the reference (non-pathogenic) allele, where $p + q = 1$.

Under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, for a bi-allelic locus with reference allele frequency $p$ and pathogenic allele frequency $q$ satisfying $p + q = 1$, the genotype frequencies in a large, randomly mating population with no evolutionary forces are:\n$$\n\\text{Frequency of } \\text{homozygous reference} = p^{2}, \\quad\n\\text{Frequency of } \\text{heterozygotes} = 2pq, \\quad\n\\text{Frequency of } \\text{homozygous pathogenic} = q^{2}.\n$$\nFor an autosomal recessive disease with complete penetrance (that is, every individual with two pathogenic alleles is affected, while heterozygotes and homozygous reference individuals are unaffected), the disease prevalence in the population is equal to the frequency of the homozygous pathogenic genotype:\n$$\nP_{\\text{disease}} = q^{2}.\n$$\nThis result follows directly from the definition of an autosomal recessive trait and the Hardy–Weinberg genotype frequency distribution.

One candidate variant in a disease gene is evaluated under the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) clinical variant interpretation framework. The evidence codes applied are PM2 (Absent/Rare in population databases; considered Moderate pathogenic evidence), PP3 (Multiple computational lines of evidence support a deleterious effect; considered Supporting pathogenic evidence), and PS3 (Well-established functional studies show a damaging effect; considered Strong pathogenic evidence).

The provided values and assumptions are realistic and internally consistent. Therefore, we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of a posterior probability of pathogenicity, $p_1$, given a prior probability, $p_0$, and three independent pieces of evidence. This is a classic application of Bayesian updating. The most direct method is to work with odds rather than probabilities, as the evidence is provided in the form of odds multipliers, which are equivalent to likelihood ratios.\n\nLet $H$ be the hypothesis that the variant is pathogenic, and $\\neg H$ be the hypothesis that it is benign. The probability of pathogenicity is denoted by $P(H)$.\n\nThe prior probability of pathogenicity is given as $p_0$:\n$$p_0 = P(H) = 0.001$$\n\nThe odds in favor of a hypothesis are defined as the ratio of the probability of the hypothesis being true to the probability of it being false.

The problem states that these are conditionally independent given the pathogenicity status. This assumption allows us to calculate the total likelihood ratio for the combined evidence by multiplying the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$\\text{LR}_{total} = \\text{LR}(E_1) \\times \\text{LR}(E_2) \\times \\text{LR}(E_3)$$\n\nThe problem provides the odds multipliers for different evidence strengths, which we treat as the likelihood ratios:\n- For $E_1$ (PM2, Moderate strength): $\\text{LR}_1 = 4.3$\n- For $E_2$ (PP3, Supporting strength): $\\text-LR}_2 = 2.08$\n- For $E_3$ (PS3, Strong strength): $\\text{LR}_3 = 18.7$\n\nNow, we calculate the total likelihood ratio:\n$$\\text{LR}_{total} = 4.3 \\times 2.08 \\times 18.7$$\n$$\\text{LR}_{total} = 8.944 \\times 18.7$$\n$$\\text{LR}_{total} = 167.2528$$\n\nNext, we calculate the posterior odds, $O_{posterior}$, by updating the prior odds with the total likelihood ratio:\n$$O_{posterior} = O_{prior} \\times \\text{LR}_{total} = \\frac{0.001}{0.999} \\times 167.2528$$\n$$O_{posterior} \\approx 0.001001001... \\times 167.2528$$\n$$O_{posterior} \\approx 0.16742022$$\n\nFinally, we convert the posterior odds back to a posterior probability, $p_1$.
