The assay used has a detection rate (analytical sensitivity among true carriers for clinically reportable pathogenic variants) denoted by $r$ with $0 < r < 1$, and clinical specificity is approximately $1$ (i.e., the probability of a false positive is negligible).

It is a standard application of Bayesian probability theory to the domain of genetic diagnostics. All parameters are clearly defined, and the task is to derive and analyze a specific quantity, the residual risk.\n\nLet us define the relevant events:\n- $C$: The event that the individual is a heterozygous carrier.\n- $N$: The event that the individual is not a carrier (i.e., the complement of $C$).\n- $T^{-}$: The event that the individual receives a negative test result.\n- $T^{+}$: The event that the individual receives a positive test result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n- The prior probability of being a carrier is $P(C) = p$.\n- The prior probability of not being a carrier is $P(N) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - p$.\n- The detection rate, or analytical sensitivity, is the probability of a positive test given the individual is a carrier: $P(T^{+} | C) = r$.\n- The clinical specificity is the probability of a negative test given the individual is not a carrier. It is given as approximately $1$, so we set $P(T^{-} | N) = 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the residual risk, which is the posterior probability that the individual is a carrier given a negative test result, denoted by $P(C | T^{-})$. We can derive this using Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nP(C | T^{-}) = \\frac{P(T^{-} | C) P(C)}{P(T^{-})}\n$$\nTo use this formula, we first need to determine the two terms on the right-hand side, $P(T^{-} | C)$ and $P(T^{-})$.\n\n$P(T^{-} | C)$ is the probability of a negative test for a true carrier. This is the false-negative rate. Since a test result for a carrier can only be positive or negative, we have:\n$$\nP(T^{-} | C) = 1 - P(T^{+} | C) = 1 - r\n$$\n$P(T^{-})$ is the total probability of receiving a negative test result. We can calculate this using the law of total probability, marginalizing over the status of the individual (carrier or non-carrier):\n$$\nP(T^{-}) = P(T^{-} | C) P(C) + P(T^{-} | N) P(N)\n$$\nSubstituting the known values into this equation:\n$$\nP(T^{-}) = (1 - r) \\cdot p + (1) \\cdot (1 - p)\n$$\n$$\nP(T^{-}) = p - pr + 1 - p = 1 - pr\n$$\nNow we can substitute the expressions for $P(C)$, $P(T^{-} | C)$, and $P(T^{-})$ back into Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nP(C | T^{-}) = \\frac{(1 - r) \\cdot p}{1 - pr}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the residual risk, which we will denote as $R(p, r)$.\n\nNext, we analyze qualitatively how this residual risk $R(p, r)$ depends on the parameters $p$ and $r$. We can do this by examining the partial derivatives of $R(p, r)$ with respect to each parameter.\n\nDependence on $p$ (prior probability):\nTo determine if the residual risk increases or decreases with $p$, we compute the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial p}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left( \\frac{p(1 - r)}{1 - pr} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$, with $u = p(1 - r)$ and $v = 1 - pr$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial p} = \\frac{(1 - r)(1 - pr) - p(1 - r)(-r)}{(1 - pr)^2} = \\frac{(1 - r - pr + pr^2) - (-pr + pr^2)}{(1 - pr)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial p} = \\frac{1 - r - pr + pr^2 + pr - pr^2}{(1 - pr)^2} = \\frac{1 - r}{(1 - pr)^2}\n$$\nGiven the constraints $0 < p < 1$ and $0 < r < 1$, the numerator $(1 - r)$ is positive, and the denominator $(1 - pr)^2$ is also positive. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial p} > 0$. This means the residual risk is a monotonically increasing function of the prior probability $p$. Qualitatively, a higher initial risk of being a carrier results in a higher final risk, even after a negative test.\n\nDependence on $r$ (detection rate):\nTo determine the dependence on $r$, we compute the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial r}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( \\frac{p - pr}{1 - pr} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the quotient rule with $u = p - pr$ and $v = 1 - pr$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial r} = \\frac{(-p)(1 - pr) - (p - pr)(-p)}{(1 - pr)^2} = \\frac{(-p + p^2r) - (-p^2 + p^2r)}{(1 - pr)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial r} = \\frac{-p + p^2r + p^2 - p^2r}{(1 - pr)^2} = \\frac{p^2 - p}{(1 - pr)^2} = \\frac{p(p - 1)}{(1 - pr)^2}\n$$\nGiven $0 < p < 1$, the term $(p - 1)$ is negative, and $p$ is positive. So, the numerator $p(p - 1)$ is negative. The denominator $(1 - pr)^2$ is positive. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial r} < 0$. This means the residual risk is a monotonically decreasing function of the detection rate $r$. Qualitatively, a more sensitive test (higher $r$) provides stronger evidence against being a carrier when the result is negative, thereby lowering the residual risk.\n\nFinally, we are asked to find the linear approximation of the residual risk in the regime where the prior probability is small, i.e., $p \\ll 1$. We can obtain this using a first-order Taylor expansion of $R(p, r)$ around $p=0$:\n$$\nR(p, r) \\approx R(0, r) + p \\cdot \\left. \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial p} \\right|_{p=0}\n$$\nFirst, we evaluate $R(p, r)$ at $p=0$:\n$$\nR(0, r) = \\frac{0 \\cdot (1 - r)}{1 - 0 \\cdot r} = 0\n$$\nNext, we evaluate the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial p}$ at $p=0$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial p} \\right|_{p=0} = \\left. \\frac{1 - r}{(1 - pr)^2} \\right|_{p=0} = \\frac{1 - r}{(1 - 0)^2} = 1 - r\n$$\nSubstituting these into the Taylor expansion formula:\n$$\nR(p, r) \\approx 0 + p(1 - r) = p(1 - r)\n$$\nThus, for small prior probabilities, the residual risk is approximately the prior probability multiplied by the false-negative rate of the test. This approximation arises because when $p$ is very small, the total probability of a negative result $P(T^{-}) = 1 - pr$ is very close to $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{p(1 - r)}{1 - pr}}\n$$", "id": "4320838"}, {"introduction": "With the rise of next-generation sequencing, carrier screening often uncovers complex results that require sophisticated interpretation.

The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nLet $A$ be the event that the child is affected by the autosomal recessive disorder. For this to occur, the child must inherit a pathogenic haplotype from Partner 1 and a pathogenic haplotype from Partner 2. A pathogenic haplotype is any haplotype carrying at least one pathogenic variant ($v_1$ or $v_2$). These are the haplotypes denoted by subscripts containing a '$1$': $H_{10}$, $H_{01}$, and $H_{11}$. The non-pathogenic (wild-type) haplotype is $H_{00}$.\n\nLet $E_1$ be the event that Partner 1 transmits a pathogenic haplotype, and $E_2$ be the event that Partner 2 transmits a pathogenic haplotype. Since the partners are unrelated, the transmission events are independent. Therefore, the probability of an affected child is:\n$$ P(A) = P(E_1) \\times P(E_2) $$\n\n**1. Probability of Partner 2 Transmitting a Pathogenic Haplotype, $P(E_2)$**\n\nPartner 2 has a residual probability $c$ of being a carrier (heterozygous for a pathogenic allele). This means Partner 2 has a genotype of the form $H_{path}/H_{00}$ with probability $c$. If Partner 2 is a carrier, they will transmit the pathogenic haplotype $H_{path}$ with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ (Mendelian segregation). With probability $1-c$, Partner 2 is not a carrier, meaning their genotype is $H_{00}/H_{00}$, and the probability of transmitting a pathogenic haplotype is $0$.\nUsing the law of total probability:\n$$ P(E_2) = P(E_2 | \\text{Partner 2 is carrier}) \\times P(\\text{Partner 2 is carrier}) + P(E_2 | \\text{Partner 2 is not carrier}) \\times P(\\text{Partner 2 is not carrier}) $$\n$$ P(E_2) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times c + (0) \\times (1-c) = \\frac{c}{2} $$\n\n**2. Probability of Partner 1 Transmitting a Pathogenic Haplotype, $P(E_1)$**\n\nPartner 1 is known to be heterozygous at both variant sites. This means their unphased genotype has one copy of $v_1$ and one copy of $v_2$. There are two possible phased genotypes (diplotypes):\n- **Cis configuration:** The two variants are on the same chromosome. The diplotype is $H_{11}/H_{00}$.\n- **Trans configuration:** The two variants are on opposite chromosomes. The diplotype is $H_{10}/H_{01}$.\n\nWe must first determine the probability of each configuration, conditional on the observation that Partner 1 is a double heterozygote. Let $G_{het}$ be this observation. The population frequency of the cis diplotype is $2x_{11}x_{00}$, and the frequency of the trans diplotype is $2x_{10}x_{01}$. Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of each configuration is proportional to its population frequency:\n$$ P(\\text{cis} | G_{het}) = \\frac{2x_{11}x_{00}}{2x_{11}x_{00} + 2x_{10}x_{01}} = \\frac{x_{11}x_{00}}{x_{11}x_{00} + x_{10}x_{01}} $$\n$$ P(\\text{trans} | G_{het}) = \\frac{2x_{10}x_{01}}{2x_{11}x_{00} + 2x_{10}x_{01}} = \\frac{x_{10}x_{01}}{x_{11}x_{00} + x_{10}x_{01}} $$\nNow, we determine the probability of transmitting a pathogenic haplotype for each configuration, assuming no recombination:\n- If cis ($H_{11}/H_{00}$), Partner 1 produces gametes $H_{11}$ (pathogenic) and $H_{00}$ (non-pathogenic), each with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $P(E_1|\\text{cis}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- If trans ($H_{10}/H_{01}$), Partner 1 produces gametes $H_{10}$ (pathogenic) and $H_{01}$ (pathogenic), each with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $P(E_1|\\text{trans}) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$.\n\nUsing the law of total probability again for $P(E_1) = P(E_1 | G_{het})$:\n$$ P(E_1) = P(E_1|\\text{cis}) P(\\text{cis}|G_{het}) + P(E_1|\\text{trans}) P(\\text{trans}|G_{het}) $$\n$$ P(E_1) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\frac{x_{11}x_{00}}{x_{11}x_{00} + x_{10}x_{01}} + (1) \\frac{x_{10}x_{01}}{x_{11}x_{00} + x_{10}x_{01}} $$\n$$ P(E_1) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}x_{11}x_{00} + x_{10}x_{01}}{x_{11}x_{00} + x_{10}x_{01}} = \\frac{x_{11}x_{00} + 2x_{10}x_{01}}{2(x_{11}x_{00} + x_{10}x_{01})} $$\n\n**3. Combine Probabilities and Simplify**\n\nThe total probability of an affected child is:\n$$ P(A) = P(E_1) \\times P(E_2) = \\left( \\frac{x_{11}x_{00} + 2x_{10}x_{01}}{2(x_{11}x_{00} + x_{10}x_{01})} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{c}{2} \\right) = \\frac{c(x_{11}x_{00} + 2x_{10}x_{01})}{4(x_{11}x_{00} + x_{10}x_{01})} $$\nTo express this in terms of the given parameters, we use the fundamental identity for the LD coefficient: $D = x_{11}x_{00} - x_{10}x_{01}$. This identity can be verified by substituting the definitions of the haplotype frequencies.\nFrom this identity, we can write $x_{11}x_{00} = D + x_{10}x_{01}$. Substituting this into the expression for $P(A)$:\n- Numerator: $c(x_{11}x_{00} + 2x_{10}x_{01}) = c((D + x_{10}x_{01}) + 2x_{10}x_{01}) = c(D + 3x_{10}x_{01})$.\n- Denominator: $4(x_{11}x_{00} + x_{10}x_{01}) = 4((D + x_{10}x_{01}) + x_{10}x_{01}) = 4(D + 2x_{10}x_{01})$.\n\nSo, the probability is:\n$$ P(A) = \\frac{c(D + 3x_{10}x_{01})}{4(D + 2x_{10}x_{01})} $$\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for $x_{10}$ and $x_{01}$ in terms of $f_1, f_2$, and $D$:\n$$ x_{10}x_{01} = (f_{1}(1 - f_{2}) - D)(f_{2}(1 - f_{1}) - D) $$\nSubstituting this gives the final closed-form expression.\n$$ P(A) = \\frac{c(D + 3(f_{1}(1 - f_{2}) - D)(f_{2}(1 - f_{1}) - D))}{4(D + 2(f_{1}(1 - f_{2}) - D)(f_{2}(1 - f_{1}) - D))} $$\nThis expression represents the exact probability of the child being affected under the given model.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{c\\left(D + 3\\left(f_{1}(1 - f_{2}) - D\\right)\\left(f_{2}(1 - f_{1}) - D\\right)\\right)}{4\\left(D + 2\\left(f_{1}(1 - f_{2}) - D\\right)\\left(f_{2}(1 - f_{1}) - D\\right)\\right)}}\n$$", "id": "4320912"}]}
