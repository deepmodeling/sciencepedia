The in vitro functional assay for inferring pathogenicity returns a positive result (functional disruption) and has sensitivity $0.92$ and specificity $0.95$. Independent RWE components contribute multiplicative evidence, quantified as likelihood ratios (LRs): family co-segregation LR $5.5$, population prevalence evidence contradicting pathogenicity LR $0.4$, a computational meta-predictor LR $1.8$, and a therapy response registry signal LR $3.2$. Assume that all evidence sources are conditionally independent given the true state of pathogenicity and that each applies in the direction indicated.\n\nThree clinical cohorts exhibit differing pretest prevalences (prior probabilities) for the event that the variant is truly pathogenic prior to testing: $p_{\\mathrm{A}} = 0.02$ (general population screening), $p_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0.20$ (genetics referral), and $p_{\\mathrm{C}} = 0.50$ (high-risk clinic).

Let $P(D)$ denote the prior probability of the variant being pathogenic. Let $E$ represent the collection of all observed evidence.\n\nFirst, we determine the likelihood ratio for the positive result from the in vitro functional assay. A positive result in this context is one that suggests functional disruption, consistent with pathogenicity. The positive likelihood ratio, $LR_{+}$, is defined as the ratio of the probability of a positive test result in a pathogenic variant to the probability of a positive test result in a non-pathogenic variant. This is equivalent to the ratio of sensitivity ($S_n$) to the false positive rate ($1 - S_p$), where $S_p$ is specificity.\n\nThe given sensitivity is $S_n = 0.92$ and the specificity is $S_p = 0.95$.\nThe likelihood ratio for the positive functional assay, $LR_{\\text{assay}}$, is:\n$$\nLR_{\\text{assay}} = \\frac{S_n}{1 - S_p} = \\frac{0.92}{1 - 0.95} = \\frac{0.92}{0.05} = 18.4\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the composite likelihood ratio, $LR_{\\text{composite}}$, for the overall workflow. The problem states that all evidence sources are conditionally independent given the true state of pathogenicity. Therefore, the composite likelihood ratio is the product of the individual likelihood ratios.\nThe individual likelihood ratios are:\n- $LR_{\\text{assay}} = 18.4$\n- $LR_{\\text{seg}} = 5.5$ (family co-segregation)\n- $LR_{\\text{pop}} = 0.4$ (population prevalence)\n- $LR_{\\text{comp}} = 1.8$ (computational meta-predictor)\n- $LR_{\\text{ther}} = 3.2$ (therapy response registry)\n\nThe composite likelihood ratio is:\n$$\nLR_{\\text{composite}} = LR_{\\text{assay}} \\times LR_{\\text{seg}} \\times LR_{\\text{pop}} \\times LR_{\\text{comp}} \\times LR_{\\text{ther}}\n$$\n$$\nLR_{\\text{composite}} = 18.4 \\times 5.5 \\times 0.4 \\times 1.8 \\times 3.2 = 233.1648\n$$\n\nTo find the post-test probability of pathogenicity, $P(D|E)$, we use the odds form of Bayes' theorem. The prior odds of pathogenicity are given by $O_{\\text{prior}} = \\frac{P(D)}{1 - P(D)}$. The posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds by the composite likelihood ratio: $O_{\\text{posterior}} = O_{\\text{prior}} \\times LR_{\\text{composite}}$. Finally, the posterior probability is recovered from the posterior odds using the formula $P(D|E) = \\frac{O_{\\text{posterior}}}{1 + O_{\\text{posterior}}}$.\n\nWe now compute this for each of the three clinical cohorts.\n\n**Cohort A (General population screening):**\nThe pretest prevalence is $p_{\\mathrm{A}} = P(D)_{\\mathrm{A}} = 0.02$.\nThe prior odds are:\n$$\nO_{\\text{prior, A}} = \\frac{0.02}{1 - 0.02} = \\frac{0.02}{0.98} = \\frac{1}{49}\n$$\nThe posterior odds are:\n$$\nO_{\\text{posterior, A}} = O_{\\text{prior, A}} \\times LR_{\\text{composite}} = \\frac{1}{49} \\times 233.1648 \\approx 4.758465\n$$\nThe post-test probability is:\n$$\nP(D|E)_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{O_{\\text{posterior, A}}}{1 + O_{\\text{posterior, A}}} = \\frac{4.758465}{1 + 4.758465} \\approx 0.826343\n$$\n\n**Cohort B (Genetics referral):**\nThe pretest prevalence is $p_{\\mathrm{B}} = P(D)_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0.20$.\nThe prior odds are:\n$$\nO_{\\text{prior, B}} = \\frac{0.20}{1 - 0.20} = \\frac{0.20}{0.80} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nThe posterior odds are:\n$$\nO_{\\text{posterior, B}} = O_{\\text{prior, B}} \\times LR_{\\text{composite}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 233.1648 = 58.2912\n$$\nThe post-test probability is:\n$$\nP(D|E)_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{O_{\\text{posterior, B}}}{1 + O_{\\text{posterior, B}}} = \\frac{58.2912}{1 + 58.2912} \\approx 0.983134\n$$\n\n**Cohort C (High-risk clinic):**\nThe pretest prevalence is $p_{\\mathrm{C}} = P(D)_{\\mathrm{C}} = 0.50$.\nThe prior odds are:\n$$\nO_{\\text{prior, C}} = \\frac{0.50}{1 - 0.50} = \\frac{0.50}{0.50} = 1\n$$\nThe posterior odds are:\n$$\nO_{\\text{posterior, C}} = O_{\\text{prior, C}} \\times LR_{\\text{composite}} = 1 \\times 233.1648 = 233.1648\n$$\nThe post-test probability is:\n$$\nP(D|E)_{\\mathrm{C}} = \\frac{O_{\\text{posterior, C}}}{1 + O_{\\text{posterior, C}}} = \\frac{233.1648}{1 + 233.1648} \\approx 0.995730\n$$\n\nThe three post-test probabilities are approximately $0.8263$, $0.9831$, and $0.9957$. The smallest of these is the value for Cohort A, which is $0.826343$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $0.8263$.\n\nRegarding the relationship between these probabilities and clinical decision thresholds:\nProfessional guidelines, such as those from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), establish categories for variant classification like \"Pathogenic\", \"Likely Pathogenic\", and \"Variant of Uncertain Significance\" (VUS). These categories correspond to ranges of post-test probability. For example, a common framework maps \"Pathogenic\" to $P(D|E) > 0.99$, \"Likely Pathogenic\" to $0.90  P(D|E) \\leq 0.99$, and \"VUS\" to the range between \"Likely Pathogenic\" and \"Likely Benign\".\n\nThis problem illustrates a critical principle: the same set of new evidence (encapsulated by $LR_{\\text{composite}} = 233.1648$) can lead to different clinical classifications depending on the pretest probability, which is determined by the patient's clinical context.\n- For Cohort A (low prior, $p_A = 0.02$), the post-test probability is $P(D|E)_{\\mathrm{A}} \\approx 0.8263$. This value does not meet the typical threshold for \"Likely Pathogenic\" (e.g., $0.90$). The variant might be classified as a VUS, albeit with strong evidence for pathogenicity, warranting further investigation but perhaps not immediate clinical action.\n- For Cohort B (intermediate prior, $p_B = 0.20$), the post-test probability is $P(D|E)_{\\mathrm{B}} \\approx 0.9831$. This falls squarely within the \"Likely Pathogenic\" range ($0.90  P \\leq 0.99$). This classification typically triggers clinical management decisions.\n- For Cohort C (high prior, $p_C = 0.50$), the post-test probability is $P(D|E)_{\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.9957$. This exceeds the strict threshold for \"Pathogenic\" ($>0.99$), indicating very high confidence and providing a firm basis for definitive clinical action.\n\nThus, the pretest prevalence is not merely an input to a formula but a crucial component of evidence-based medicine, demonstrating that test results cannot be interpreted in a vacuum. A patient's personal and family history, which informs the prior probability, is indispensable for the final assessment of a genetic variant.\n\nThe smallest of the three post-test probabilities is $P(D|E)_{\\mathrm{A}} \\approx 0.826343$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8263}$$", "id": "4375695"}, {"introduction": "Evaluating the effectiveness of therapies using RWE is often complicated by time-varying confounding, where treatment decisions and a patient's health status influence each other over time. This practice tackles this challenge by introducing a powerful causal inference technique known as Marginal Structural Models (MSMs) with Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW). By calculating a stabilized weight for a patient undergoing a genotype-informed dosing regimen, you will gain hands-on experience in adjusting for treatment-confounder feedback, a critical skill for drawing valid causal conclusions from longitudinal observational data [@problem_id:4375632].", "problem": "A real-world evidence cohort study follows adults initiating a narrow-therapeutic-index drug with genotype-informed dosing over $T=2$ decision times, $t \\in \\{0,1\\}$, prior to outcome assessment at $t=2$.

You will construct stabilized inverse probability weights for treatment using time-varying propensity scores and then specify a Marginal Structural Model (MSM) for the causal effect of the high-dose regimen on $Y$.\n\nTreatment assignment models are estimated from the observational data as follows.
