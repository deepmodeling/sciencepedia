Assume that freeze-thaw–induced failure events are independent across cycles within an aliquot and that per-cycle failure probability is $p=0.001$. Over a $10$-year period, historical utilization indicates that each aliquot experiences, on average, $5$ freeze-thaw cycles. An aliquot is deemed lost if any of its freeze-thaw cycles causes failure, and each aliquot has equal volume.

(The term \"average\" is interpreted as the fixed number of cycles for a representative aliquot, a standard convention in such problems).\n- An aliquot is lost if any of its freeze-thaw cycles causes failure.\n- A sample has a total volume $V$ split evenly across $n$ aliquots.\n- Total planned retrieval events over $10$ years is $T$.\n- Retrievals are distributed evenly, so each aliquot experiences $T/n$ cycles.\n- The final answer should be the numerical value for the expected fraction of aliquots lost, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the validation criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on established principles of reliability and probability theory (specifically, Bernoulli trials). The context of sample degradation due to freeze-thaw cycles in biobanking is a real and significant issue. The assumptions of independence and constant failure probability are standard modeling choices for such phenomena. The problem is scientifically realistic.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined. The first part asks for an expected fraction, which is equivalent to a probability, given a specific number of trials ($k=5$) and a per-trial probability ($p=0.001$). The second part asks for the derivation of a function representing expected loss, $L(n)$, and its optimization. The parameters for this derivation ($V$, $T$, $p$, $n$) are defined, leading to a unique functional form and a clear optimization goal. The structure allows for a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language, free from subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem that can be formally solved using principles of probability and calculus. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Part 1: Expected Fraction of Aliquots Lost\n\nThe process of a single freeze-thaw cycle for an aliquot can be modeled as a Bernoulli trial. Let $S_i$ be the event that the aliquot survives the $i$-th cycle, and $F_i$ be the event that it fails.\n\nThe probability of failure in a single cycle is given as $p = 0.001$.\nThe probability of survival in a single cycle is therefore $P(S_i) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.001 = 0.999$.\n\nAn aliquot is considered \"lost\" if it fails in any of its freeze-thaw cycles. It is easier to first calculate the probability of the complementary event: the aliquot survives all of its cycles. Let $k=5$ be the number of cycles an aliquot experiences.\n\nThe problem states that failure events are independent. Therefore, the probability that an aliquot survives all $k$ cycles is the product of the probabilities of surviving each individual cycle:\n$$P(\\text{Survival}) = P(S_1 \\cap S_2 \\cap \\dots \\cap S_k)$$\nDue to independence, this becomes:\n$$P(\\text{Survival}) = P(S_1) \\times P(S_2) \\times \\dots \\times P(S_k) = (1-p)^k$$\n\nThe probability that an aliquot is lost, $P(\\text{Loss})$, is the complement of survival:\n$$P(\\text{Loss}) = 1 - P(\\text{Survival}) = 1 - (1-p)^k$$\n\nBy the law of large numbers, the expected fraction of aliquots lost from a large population is equal to this probability.\nSubstituting the given values $p=0.001$ and $k=5$:\n$$P(\\text{Loss}) = 1 - (1 - 0.001)^5 = 1 - (0.999)^5$$\n\nWe compute the numerical value:\n$$(0.999)^5 \\approx 0.99500999$$\nTherefore,\n$$P(\\text{Loss}) \\approx 1 - 0.99500999 = 0.00499001$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $4$, $9$, $9$, and $0$. The fifth significant figure is $0$, so we round down.\n$$P(\\text{Loss}) \\approx 0.004990$$\n\nThis is the expected fraction of aliquots lost.\n\n### Part 2: Mitigation Strategy Analysis\n\nThis part requires deriving the expected lost volume $L(n)$ and determining the optimal number of aliquots, $n$.\n\n- Total sample volume: $V$\n- Number of aliquots: $n$\n- Volume per aliquot: $V_a = \\frac{V}{n}$\n- Total retrievals: $T$\n- Cycles per aliquot: $k_n = \\frac{T}{n}$\n- Per-cycle failure probability: $p$\n\nThe probability of a single aliquot being lost, $P_{\\text{loss}}(n)$, now depends on $n$ through the number of cycles $k_n$:\n$$P_{\\text{loss}}(n) = 1 - (1-p)^{k_n} = 1 - (1-p)^{T/n}$$\n\nThe expected lost volume from a single aliquot is its volume multiplied by its probability of being lost:\n$$E[\\text{Lost volume per aliquot}] = V_a \\times P_{\\text{loss}}(n) = \\frac{V}{n} \\left(1 - (1-p)^{T/n}\\right)$$\n\nThe total expected lost volume, $L(n)$, for the entire sample (all $n$ aliquots) is the sum of the expected losses from each aliquot. Since they are identical, we multiply by $n$:\n$$L(n) = n \\times \\frac{V}{n} \\left(1 - (1-p)^{T/n}\\right)$$\n$$L(n) = V \\left(1 - (1-p)^{T/n}\\right)$$\n\nTo minimize the expected lost volume $L(n)$ with respect to $n$ (for fixed $V$, $T$, and $p$), we need to analyze the function $L(n)$. Minimizing $L(n)$ is equivalent to minimizing $V \\left(1 - (1-p)^{T/n}\\right)$. Since $V$ is a positive constant, this is equivalent to minimizing $1 - (1-p)^{T/n}$. This, in turn, is equivalent to maximizing the term $(1-p)^{T/n}$.\n\nLet the function to be maximized be $f(n) = (1-p)^{T/n}$.\nThe base of the exponential, $b = 1-p$, is a constant such that $0 < b < 1$.\nThe exponent is $x(n) = T/n$.\nFor a fixed base $b \\in (0,1)$, the function $b^x$ is a strictly decreasing function of its exponent $x$. Therefore, to maximize $f(n)$, we must minimize its exponent $x(n) = T/n$.\n\nTo minimize the positive quantity $T/n$, we must make the denominator $n$ as large as possible. Thus, $L(n)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $n$. The theoretical minimum is approached as $n \\to \\infty$:\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} L(n) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} V \\left(1 - (1-p)^{T/n}\\right) = V \\left(1 - (1-p)^{0}\\right) = V(1-1) = 0$$\n\nIn a practical biobanking context, this means that the risk of loss is minimized by using the largest possible number of aliquots. The most logical upper bound for $n$ is the total number of retrieval events, $T$. If we set $n=T$, then each aliquot is designated for a single retrieval, experiencing exactly one freeze-thaw cycle (since $k_n = T/T = 1$). This strategy, often called \"single-use aliquoting,\" minimizes freeze-thaw-induced damage across the entire sample. Any $n > T$ would imply some aliquots are never used, which does not further reduce risk for the used aliquots. Therefore, the optimal practical choice is $n=T$.\n\nThis choice aligns with ethical obligations of biobank governance. The principle of stewardship requires that donated biological specimens, which are a finite and precious resource, be managed to maximize their scientific value and minimize waste. By choosing $n=T$, the biobank minimizes the expected volume of lost sample material ($L(T) = Vp$, which is the minimum achievable non-zero loss). This demonstrates respect for the participant's contribution and ensures the long-term integrity and availability of the specimen for future research, fulfilling the ethical mandate to protect and preserve these valuable resources.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.004990}$$", "id": "4318618"}, {"introduction": "Participant consent is the ethical cornerstone of biobanking, but different consent models can have significant long-term operational consequences.

Definition of Post-Stratification Weights**\n\nPost-stratification aims to correct for the discrepancy between cohort proportions ($p_{s}^{\\text{coh}}$) and population proportions ($p_{s}^{\\text{pop}}$) for each stratum $s$. An unbiased estimator of the population mean is constructed by weighting the stratum sample means by the true population proportions:\n$$ \\hat{\\mu}_{\\text{w}} = p_{M}^{\\text{pop}} \\bar{Y}_{M} + p_{A}^{\\text{pop}} \\bar{Y}_{A} $$\nThis estimator can be represented as a weighted sum of individual observations, $\\sum_{k_s} w_s Y_{k_s}$, where $w_s$ is the weight for each individual in stratum $s$. To yield an unbiased estimator, these weights are typically defined to make the weighted sample size of each stratum proportional to its population size. The standard post-stratification weight for an individual in stratum $s$ is the ratio of the population proportion to the cohort proportion:\n$$ w_s = \\frac{p_s^{\\text{pop}}}{p_s^{\\text{coh}}} $$\nFor our two strata, the weights are:\n$$ w_{M} = \\frac{p_{M}^{\\text{pop}}}{p_{M}^{\\text{coh}}} = \\frac{0.10}{0.20} = 0.5 $$\n$$ w_{A} = \\frac{p_{A}^{\\text{pop}}}{p_{A}^{\\text{coh}}} = \\frac{0.90}{0.80} = \\frac{9}{8} = 1.125 $$\nThese weights ensure that the weighted estimator is unbiased. The correctly normalized estimator using these weights is $\\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{\\sum_k w_k Y_k}{\\sum_k w_k}$. The denominator is $\\sum_{i=1}^{n_M} w_M + \\sum_{j=1}^{n_A} w_A = n_M w_M + n_A w_A = n_M \\frac{p_M^{\\text{pop}}}{p_M^{\\text{coh}}} + n_A \\frac{p_A^{\\text{pop}}}{p_A^{\\text{coh}}}$. Since $p_s^{\\text{coh}} = n_s/N$, this is $n_M \\frac{p_M^{\\text{pop}}}{n_M/N} + n_A \\frac{p_A^{\\text{pop}}}{n_A/N} = N p_M^{\\text{pop}} + N p_A^{\\text{pop}} = N(p_M^{\\text{pop}} + p_A^{\\text{pop}}) = N$. The numerator is $\\sum w_k Y_k = w_M (n_M \\bar{Y}_M) + w_A (n_A \\bar{Y}_A) = p_M^{\\text{pop}} N \\bar{Y}_M + p_A^{\\text{pop}} N \\bar{Y}_A$.
