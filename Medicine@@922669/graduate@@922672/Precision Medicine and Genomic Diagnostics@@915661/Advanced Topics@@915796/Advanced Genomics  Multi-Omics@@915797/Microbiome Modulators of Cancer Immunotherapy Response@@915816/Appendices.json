Immunotherapy-treated mice are randomized to be colonized with microbiota from human responders or from non-responders. For each mouse indexed by $i$, longitudinal tumor volumes $V_{i}(t)$ are measured at regular intervals from day $t=0$ to $t=T$, with $T=28$. To obtain a single mouse-level measure of tumor control that respects within-mouse temporal correlation and avoids pseudo-replication, the investigators will summarize each trajectory by the area under the tumor volume curve normalized by baseline, $A_{i}=\\int_{0}^{T} \\frac{V_{i}(t)}{V_{i}(0)}\\,dt$.

The composition vectors are valid as their components sum to $1$ ($0.05+0.45+0.30+0.20=1.00$ and $0.20+0.35+0.25+0.20=1.00$). The outcomes for each group contain both responders and non-responders, allowing for the calculation of finite empirical logits.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language, free of any subjectivity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and free of any contradictions or ambiguities. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the odds ratio for response per $\\mathrm{IQR}$ increase in the Akkermansia CLR coordinate. Let's proceed step-by-step.\n\nFirst, we determine the values of the predictor variable, $z_{i,\\mathrm{Akk}}$, for all patients.\nThe patients are divided into two groups with distinct compositions. All patients within a group have identical compositions, hence they will have the same CLR coordinate for Akkermansia.\n\nLet $z_L$ be the CLR coordinate for the low Akkermansia group (patients $1$–$4$) and $z_H$ be the CLR coordinate for the high Akkermansia group (patients $5$–$8$).\nThe set of CLR coordinates for the entire cohort of $8$ patients is $\\{z_L, z_L, z_L, z_L, z_H, z_H, z_H, z_H\\}$.\nThe explicit calculation of $z_L$ and $z_H$ is not necessary to find the final answer, but we can verify they are distinct.\nFor the low group: $a_L = \\{0.05, 0.45, 0.30, 0.20\\}$. The log-geometric mean is $G_L = \\frac{1}{4}(\\ln(0.05) + \\ln(0.45) + \\ln(0.30) + \\ln(0.20))$. So, $z_L = \\ln(0.05) - G_L$.\nFor the high group: $a_H = \\{0.20, 0.35, 0.25, 0.20\\}$. The log-geometric mean is $G_H = \\frac{1}{4}(\\ln(0.20) + \\ln(0.35) + \\ln(0.25) + \\ln(0.20))$. So, $z_H = \\ln(0.20) - G_H$.\nWithout completing the calculation, it is clear that $z_L \\neq z_H$. Numerically, $z_L \\approx -1.3438$ and $z_H \\approx -0.1957$, so $z_L < z_H$.\n\nNext, we compute the interquartile range (IQR) of the set of $z_{i,\\mathrm{Akk}}$ values. The sorted data set is $\\{z_L, z_L, z_L, z_L, z_H, z_H, z_H, z_H\\}$.\nAccording to Tukey's definition, the first quartile ($Q_1$) is the median of the lower half of the data, and the third quartile ($Q_3$) is the median of the upper half.\nThe data set has $N=8$ points. The lower half is the first $4$ points $\\{z_L, z_L, z_L, z_L\\}$, and the upper half is the last $4$ points $\\{z_H, z_H, z_H, z_H\\}$.\nThe median of the lower half is $\\frac{z_L + z_L}{2} = z_L$. Thus, $Q_1 = z_L$.\nThe median of the upper half is $\\frac{z_H + z_H}{2} = z_H$. Thus, $Q_3 = z_H$.\nThe interquartile range is therefore $\\mathrm{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1 = z_H - z_L$.\n\nNow, we derive the parameter $\\beta$ from the logistic regression model by equating the fitted logits to the empirical logits for the two groups.\nThe empirical logit for a group is given by $\\ln(\\frac{k}{n-k})$, where $k$ is the number of responders and $n$ is the total number of patients in the group.\n\nFor the low Akkermansia group (predictor value $z_L$):\n- Number of patients $n_L=4$.\n- Outcomes are $\\{0,0,0,1\\}$.\n- Number of responders $k_L=1$.\n- The empirical logit is $\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{4-1}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -\\ln(3)$.\n\nFor the high Akkermansia group (predictor value $z_H$):\n- Number of patients $n_H=4$.\n- Outcomes are $\\{1,1,0,1\\}$.\n- Number of responders $k_H=3$.\n- The empirical logit is $\\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{4-3}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{1}\\right) = \\ln(3)$.\n\nThe logistic regression model is $\\ln\\left(\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}\\right) = \\alpha + \\beta z_{i,\\mathrm{Akk}}$. Equating the model's fitted logit to the empirical logit for each group gives a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n1. For the low group: $\\alpha + \\beta z_L = -\\ln(3)$\n2. For the high group: $\\alpha + \\beta z_H = \\ln(3)$\n\nTo find $\\beta$, we subtract the first equation from the second:\n$(\\alpha + \\beta z_H) - (\\alpha + \\beta z_L) = \\ln(3) - (-\\ln(3))$\n$\\beta(z_H - z_L) = 2\\ln(3)$\nSolving for $\\beta$:\n$\\beta = \\frac{2\\ln(3)}{z_H - z_L}$\n\nFinally, we compute the odds ratio for response per IQR increase in Akkermansia CLR, defined as $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\mathrm{IQR}} \\equiv \\exp(\\beta \\cdot \\mathrm{IQR})$.\nWe substitute our expressions for $\\beta$ and $\\mathrm{IQR}$:\n$\\mathrm{OR}_{\\mathrm{IQR}} = \\exp\\left( \\left(\\frac{2\\ln(3)}{z_H - z_L}\\right) \\cdot (z_H - z_L) \\right)$\n\nSince $z_H \\neq z_L$, the term $(z_H - z_L)$ cancels out:\n$\\mathrm{OR}_{\\mathrm{IQR}} = \\exp(2\\ln(3))$\n\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\exp(k\\ln x) = x^k$:\n$\\mathrm{OR}_{\\mathrm{IQR}} = 3^2 = 9$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
