Consider microRNA-223 (miR-223), which is highly enriched in platelets. Assume the following scientifically supported premises as your starting point: (i) platelets are anucleate cells that contain mature miRNAs; (ii) clotting activates platelets and promotes release of platelet cargo into the serum; (iii) in platelet-poor plasma, most platelets are removed, minimizing release of platelet-derived miRNAs; and (iv) absolute quantification assays (for example, digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (digital PCR)) report concentrations proportional to the total number of target molecules per unit volume.\n\nYou are given these plausible, self-consistent parameters for whole blood and processing:\n- The whole-blood platelet count is $2.5 \\times 10^{8}$ platelets per milliliter.\n- Each platelet contains $2.0 \\times 10^{3}$ copies of miR-223.\n- During coagulation to generate serum, an average fraction $0.30$ of platelet miR-223 is released into the serum supernatant before platelet removal by clot retraction.\n- Platelet-poor plasma is prepared such that a fraction $0.001$ of platelets remain.\n- In platelet-poor plasma (no clotting), a fraction $0.02$ of miR-223 from the residual platelets is released into the plasma during handling.\n- There is a non-platelet background of circulating cell-free miR-223 from other tissues equal to $1.0 \\times 10^{10}$ copies per milliliter, independent of clotting or platelet removal.\n\nAssume that measured concentration equals the sum of the non-platelet background plus any released platelet-derived miR-223 present in the matrix. Using only mass balance and these definitions, derive from first principles the expected fold increase in measured miR-223 concentration in serum relative to platelet-poor plasma that would arise solely from platelet activation artifacts during clotting.

The measured concentration in any given matrix is the sum of a constant non-platelet background and the concentration of miR-223 released from platelets.\n\nFirst, let us define the symbolic variables based on the given parameters:\n-   $P_{WB}$: The whole-blood platelet count, given as $2.5 \\times 10^{8}$ platelets per milliliter.\n-   $N_{miR}$: The number of copies of miR-223 per platelet, given as $2.0 \\times 10^{3}$ copies.\n-   $C_{bg}$: The non-platelet background concentration of circulating cell-free miR-223, given as $1.0 \\times 10^{10}$ copies per milliliter.\n-   $f_{S}$: The fraction of platelet miR-223 content released into serum during coagulation, given as $0.30$.\n-   $f_{P,rem}$: The fraction of platelets from whole blood that remain in platelet-poor plasma after processing, given as $0.001$.\n-   $f_{P,rel}$: The fraction of miR-223 from the residual platelets that is released into the plasma supernatant, given as $0.02$.\n\nThe total potential concentration of miR-223 from all platelets in the initial whole blood sample, which we shall denote as $C_{plt,total}$, is the product of the platelet count and the number of miR-223 copies per platelet:\n$$C_{plt,total} = P_{WB} \\times N_{miR}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$C_{plt,total} = (2.5 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ mL}^{-1}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{3}) = 5.0 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ mL}^{-1}$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the total measured concentration of miR-223 in serum, denoted as $C_{serum}$. This concentration is the sum of the background concentration $C_{bg}$ and the contribution from platelets released during clotting.\nThe platelet-derived contribution in serum, $C_{S,plt}$, is the total potential concentration from all platelets multiplied by the release fraction $f_{S}$.\n$$C_{S,plt} = C_{plt,total} \\times f_{S} = (P_{WB} \\times N_{miR}) \\times f_{S}$$\nThe total serum concentration is therefore:\n$$C_{serum} = C_{bg} + C_{S,plt} = C_{bg} + (P_{WB} \\times N_{miR} \\times f_{S})$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$C_{serum} = (1.0 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ mL}^{-1}) + (5.0 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ mL}^{-1} \\times 0.30)$$\n$$C_{serum} = (1.0 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ mL}^{-1}) + (1.5 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ mL}^{-1})$$\nTo sum these values, we express them with a common power of $10$:\n$$C_{serum} = (0.1 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ mL}^{-1}) + (1.5 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ mL}^{-1}) = 1.6 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ mL}^{-1}$$\n\nNow, we derive the expression for the total measured concentration of miR-223 in platelet-poor plasma, denoted as $C_{ppp}$.

The calculation will be performed using the comparative threshold quantification method, commonly known as the $\\Delta\\Delta C_t$ method, under the assumption of ideal amplification efficiency.\n\nThe fundamental principle of qPCR with ideal efficiency is that the quantity of amplified DNA, $N_n$, after $n$ cycles is given by the initial quantity of template, $N_0$, multiplied by $2^n$.\n$$N_n = N_0 \\times 2^n$$\nThe threshold cycle, $C_t$, is the cycle number at which the amount of amplified product reaches a fixed fluorescence threshold, corresponding to a constant amount of DNA, $N_T$. Thus, at the threshold cycle:\n$$N_T = N_0 \\times 2^{C_t}$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express the initial template quantity, $N_0$, as a function of the threshold cycle, $C_t$:\n$$N_0 = N_T \\times 2^{-C_t}$$\nSince $N_T$ is a constant for the experiment, the initial abundance of a template is inversely proportional to $2$ raised to the power of its $C_t$ value:\n$$N_0 \\propto 2^{-C_t}$$\n\nThe comparative $C_t$ method involves two main steps: normalization and comparison.\n\nFirst, within each sample (case and control), the abundance of the target miRNA is normalized to the abundance of an endogenous reference RNA.
