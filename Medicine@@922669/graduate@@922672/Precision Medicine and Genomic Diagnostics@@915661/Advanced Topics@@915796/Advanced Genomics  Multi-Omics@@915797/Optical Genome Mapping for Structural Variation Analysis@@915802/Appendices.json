Consider a labeling enzyme that recognizes the 6-base recognition sequence \"CACGAG\".

It presents a valid quantitative question based on an idealized but standard model in bioinformatics, combined with a qualitative question grounded in established biochemical principles. We may therefore proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two parts: first, to calculate the expected label density for a specific DNA motif under an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) model, and second, to qualitatively describe how CpG methylation would affect this density.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Expected Label Density**\n\nThe labeling enzyme recognizes the specific $6$-base sequence, or $6$-mer, $\\text{\"CACGAG\"}$. The length of this recognition motif is $L=6$.\nThe problem provides a simplified model of a genome where nucleotide bases are i.i.d. with the following probabilities:\n$P(\\text{A}) = 0.3$\n$P(\\text{T}) = 0.3$\n$P(\\text{C}) = 0.2$\n$P(\\text{G}) = 0.2$\nThe sum of probabilities is $0.3 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.2 = 1.0$, as required.\n\nUnder the i.i.d. assumption, the probability of a specific sequence of nucleotides appearing at a given position is the product of the probabilities of its constituent bases. The probability, $p$, of the motif $\\text{\"CACGAG\"}$ occurring at any given starting position is:\n$$p = P(\\text{C}) \\times P(\\text{A}) \\times P(\\text{C}) \\times P(\\text{G}) \\times P(\\text{A}) \\times P(\\text{G})$$\nThis can be grouped by base type:\n$$p = (P(\\text{A}))^{2} \\times (P(\\text{C}))^{2} \\times (P(\\text{G}))^{2}$$\nSubstituting the given probabilities:\n$$p = (0.3)^{2} \\times (0.2)^{2} \\times (0.2)^{2}$$\n$$p = (0.09) \\times (0.04) \\times (0.04)$$\n$$p = 0.0036 \\times 0.04 = 0.000144$$\nIn scientific notation, this probability is $p = 1.44 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n\nThis value $p$ represents the probability that the specific $6$-mer starts at any single position in the genome. To find the expected number of labels, we use the principle of linearity of expectation. Consider a very long genome segment of $N$ base pairs. There are $N-L+1$ possible starting positions for a motif of length $L$. Let us define an indicator random variable $X_i$ for each possible starting position $i$ (where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N-L+1$):\n$$ X_i = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if the motif starts at position } i \\\\ 0  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nThe expectation of this indicator variable is the probability that the motif starts at position $i$:\n$$E[X_i] = 1 \\times P(X_i=1) + 0 \\times P(X_i=0) = P(X_i=1) = p$$\nThe total number of labels (motifs) in the segment, $N_{labels}$, is the sum of these indicator variables: $N_{labels} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-L+1} X_i$.\nBy linearity of expectation, the expected total number of labels is:\n$$E[N_{labels}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N-L+1} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-L+1} E[X_i] = (N-L+1)p$$\nThe problem states that the genome segment is very long, so edge effects are negligible. This allows us to approximate $N-L+1 \\approx N$.\n$$E[N_{labels}] \\approx Np$$\nThe expected label density, $\\rho_{bp}$, is the expected number of labels per base pair, which is derived by dividing the expected number of labels by the length of the segment:\n$$\\rho_{bp} = \\frac{E[N_{labels}]}{N} \\approx \\frac{Np}{N} = p = 1.44 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ labels/bp}$$\nThe problem requires the final result to be expressed in labels per megabase (Mb), where $1 \\text{ Mb} = 10^6$ base pairs. We convert the density:\n$$\\rho_{Mb} = \\rho_{bp} \\times 10^6 \\text{ bp/Mb}$$\n$$\\rho_{Mb} = (1.44 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 10^6 = 144$$\nThe resulting expected label density is $144$ labels per megabase. This value is already stated to three significant figures.\n\n**Part 2: Qualitative Analysis of CpG Methylation Effects**\n\nThe second part of the problem requires a qualitative explanation of how CpG methylation affects the realized label density.\nThe recognition motif is $\\text{C-A-C-G-A-G}$. We must first inspect this sequence for the presence of a Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) dinucleotide. A CpG site is a cytosine base followed immediately by a guanine base in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction. The motif contains such a dinucleotide at positions $3$ and $4$: $\\text{CA}\\underline{\\text{CG}}\\text{AG}$.\n\nThe problem states that 5-methylcytosine in CpG dinucleotides can reduce or abolish recognition by the enzyme. In vertebrate genomes, a significant fraction of CpG dinucleotides are methylated at the cytosine base. This epigenetic modification serves as a key mechanism for gene regulation.\n\nBecause the enzyme's recognition site contains a CpG dinucleotide, its ability to bind and label the DNA is dependent on the methylation status of that specific CpG site. If the cytosine within the $\\text{CG}$ part of a $\\text{CACGAG}$ sequence is methylated, the enzyme will fail to recognize and label it.\n\nThe i.i.d. model used in Part 1 calculates the expected frequency of the raw sequence $\\text{\"CACGAG\"}$ based solely on base composition, inherently assuming all such sequences are recognizable. However, in a real biological context, only the subset of $\\text{CACGAG}$ sites that are *unmethylated* will be labeled. Therefore, the actual, experimentally observed (realized) label density will be lower than the theoretical density of $144$ labels/Mb calculated from the i.i.d. model. The magnitude of this reduction is proportional to the fraction of $\\text{CACGAG}$ sites that are methylated.\n\nThe deviation between the i.i.d.-based expectation and the observed label density would be most pronounced under circumstances where the simplifying assumptions of the model are most strongly violated. This occurs when:\n1.  **High Prevalence of CpG Methylation:** The genomic region being analyzed has a high overall level of CpG methylation. In many vertebrate genomes, CpG methylation is the default state for CpG sites located outside of specialized regions like CpG islands.\n2.  **Genomic Context of the Motif:** The $\\text{CACGAG}$ motifs are predominantly located in genomic regions that are subject to heavy methylation, such as intergenic regions, repetitive elements, or the bodies of transcriptionally repressed genes. If the motifs were, by contrast, concentrated in CpG islands (which are typically unmethylated and associated with active gene promoters), the observed density would be much closer to the i.i.d. prediction.\n\nThus, the strongest deviation from expectation would occur in a genome with high global CpG methylation where the enzyme's recognition sites are distributed across bulk chromatin, rather than being protected from methylation within CpG islands. This illustrates a fundamental limitation of the i.i.d. model: it fails to account for both local nucleotide correlations (e.g., CpG suppression) and epigenetic modifications, both of which are critical features of real genomes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{144}$$", "id": "4365696"}, {"introduction": "Aligning an experimentally measured molecule map to a reference genome requires a robust statistical framework to account for measurement noise.

The reference pattern on the interval $[7, 21]$, which includes labels at $\\{7, 13, 21\\}$, is repeated. The two copies are adjacent, in the same orientation, and the inter-label distances are preserved within the specified scaling tolerance ($0.95 \\le \\alpha \\le 1.05$). Therefore, $M_1$ represents a tandem duplication.\n\n2.  **Analyze Novel Insertion**: The definition specifies three key features:\n    *   **Novelty**: An inserted block of sequence/labels is not present anywhere in the reference genome.\n    *   **Pattern Mismatch**: The order and spacing of labels in the inserted block do not match any reference pattern.\n    *   **Adjacency Break**: The insertion disrupts the contiguity of the reference genome, appearing between two segments that are adjacent in the reference.\n    Molecule $M_2$ exhibits these features. Between the reference-anchored positions $p=21$ and $p=33$, there is a block of labels that cannot be matched to the reference. This block breaks the adjacency that should exist between the region ending at $21$ kb and the region starting after $21$ kb. Therefore, $M_2$ represents a novel insertion.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the General Rule**: A correct decision rule must accurately capture both definitions.\n    *   To identify a tandem duplication, one must look for a contiguous, adjacent repetition of a reference-matching label pattern, in the same orientation, with spacing preserved up to a scaling tolerance.\n    *   To identify a novel insertion, one must look for a block of labels, situated between two reference-anchored segments, whose pattern does not match the reference anywhere, thereby breaking the adjacency of the flanking reference segments.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Call tandem duplication when a contiguous, adjacent repeat of a reference-matching label pattern appears in the same orientation between the same flanking anchors, with inter-label spacing preserved up to uniform stretch scaling; call novel insertion when a block of labels between two reference-anchored segments does not match the reference label order-and-spacing pattern anywhere and disrupts the direct adjacency of those anchors.**\nThis option accurately and completely summarizes the definitions provided in the problem statement and the logic derived above. The description for tandem duplication matches the case of $M_1$, and the description for novel insertion matches the case of $M_2$.\n*Verdict: **Correct***\n\n**B. Call novel insertion when a contiguous, adjacent repeat of a reference-matching label pattern appears in the same orientation between the same flanking anchors; call tandem duplication when a block of labels between anchors does not match the reference anywhere and disrupts adjacency.**\nThis option incorrectly swaps the definitions. It assigns the term \"novel insertion\" to the event described for molecule $M_1$ (a tandem duplication) and the term \"tandem duplication\" to the event described for molecule $M_2$ (a novel insertion). This is a direct contradiction of the provided definitions.\n*Verdict: **Incorrect***\n\n**C. Call novel insertion whenever any duplicated pattern is observed in reverse orientation between anchors; call tandem duplication only if the duplicated pattern is reverse-oriented and separated by unmatched labels.**\nThis option introduces incorrect conditions. A tandem duplication, by the provided definition, occurs in the *same* orientation, not reverse. A duplicated pattern in reverse orientation would be classified as an inverted duplication, which is a different type of SV. Furthermore, it defines novel insertion in terms of a duplicated pattern, which contradicts the core concept of a novel insertion containing a pattern not found in the reference.\n*Verdict: **Incorrect***\n\n**D. Call tandem duplication only if the duplicated segment’s inter-label distances match the reference exactly with zero stretch variation; otherwise, any deviation (including small uniform scaling) implies a novel insertion.**\nThis option introduces an overly strict and unrealistic constraint. The problem explicitly states that tandem duplications preserve the pattern \"up to local stretch scaling\" and gives an example tolerance of $0.95 \\le \\alpha \\le 1.05$. Requiring an exact match with $\\alpha = 1.0$ ignores the physical realities of the OGM experiment and contradicts the premise of the problem. This rule would incorrectly classify many true tandem duplications.\n*Verdict: **Incorrect***\n\nBased on the rigorous application of the provided definitions and analysis of the sample cases, Option A is the only choice that correctly formulates the decision rule.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4365732"}]}
