Instead, they are first cleaved into smaller, more manageable peptides using a protease. This exercise focuses on the foundational skill of predicting the outcome of enzymatic digestion, the first crucial step in generating the data for a proteomics experiment. By applying the specific cleavage rules of trypsin, the workhorse enzyme of proteomics, you will perform an *in silico* digestion to determine the theoretical peptides that would be produced from a given protein sequence, a core competency for both designing experiments and interpreting the resulting data [@problem_id:4373830].", "problem": "In bottom-up proteomics for precision diagnostics, enzymatic digestion using trypsin is modeled by the rule that trypsin cleaves at the carboxyl side of lysine ($\\mathrm{K}$) or arginine ($\\mathrm{R}$) residues unless the $\\mathrm{K}/\\mathrm{R}$ is immediately followed by proline ($\\mathrm{P}$). Consider the amino acid sequence $\\mathrm{AKRPQK}$. A fully specific tryptic peptide is defined as a contiguous subsequence whose N-terminus is either the protein N-terminus or immediately after a permissible trypsin cleavage, and whose C-terminus is at a permissible trypsin cleavage or the protein C-terminus. A missed cleavage is defined as a permissible cleavage site that occurs internally within a peptide but is not cut. Assume at most $m=1$ missed cleavage is allowed in peptide generation.\n\nUsing only the stated specificity rule, determine from first principles the complete set of theoretical fully specific peptides produced from $\\mathrm{AKRPQK}$ with up to $m=1$ missed cleavage, and then compute the sum of their neutral monoisotopic masses by applying the well-tested convention that a peptide’s neutral monoisotopic mass equals the sum of its constituent residue monoisotopic masses plus the mass of water.

A unique solution can be determined by a systematic application of the given rules.\n\nThe solution process involves three primary steps: (1) identification of theoretical peptides based on the trypsin cleavage rule and the missed cleavage allowance, (2) calculation of the neutral monoisotopic mass for each identified peptide, and (3) summation of these masses followed by rounding to the specified precision.\n\n**Step 1: Identification of Theoretical Peptides**\n\nFirst, we must identify all permissible cleavage sites within the given amino acid sequence, $\\mathrm{AKRPQK}$. The sequence with residue positions is $\\mathrm{A(1)K(2)R(3)P(4)Q(5)K(6)}$.\n\nThe rule for tryptic cleavage is that it occurs at the carboxyl side (C-terminus) of lysine ($\\mathrm{K}$) or arginine ($\\mathrm{R}$), unless the residue is immediately followed by a proline ($\\mathrm{P}$).\n\nLet's inspect each potential cleavage site:\n1.  After $\\mathrm{K}$ at position $2$: The following residue is $\\mathrm{R}$ at position $3$. Since this is not a proline, cleavage is permissible.\n2.  After $\\mathrm{R}$ at position $3$: The following residue is $\\mathrm{P}$ at position $4$. According to the rule, the presence of proline inhibits cleavage. Therefore, no cleavage occurs here.\n3.  After $\\mathrm{K}$ at position $6$: This is the C-terminus of the entire protein sequence. By definition, this is a terminal cleavage point.\n\nThus, we have potential cleavage points at the N-terminus of the protein (by definition), after $\\mathrm{K(2)}$, and at the C-terminus of the protein (after $\\mathrm{K(6)}$). Let us denote these cleavage boundaries as $p_0$ (at the start), $p_1$ (after $\\mathrm{K(2)}$), and $p_2$ (at the end).\nThe sequence is segmented as follows:\n$\\mathrm{ [p_0] \\ A \\ K \\ [p_1] \\ R \\ P \\ Q \\ K \\ [p_2] }$\n\nA fully specific peptide is formed between two such boundaries, $p_i$ and $p_j$, where $j>i$. The number of missed cleavages ($n_{mc}$) within such a peptide is the number of permissible cleavage sites it contains internally, which is equal to $j - i - 1$. The problem states that at most $m=1$ missed cleavage is allowed, so we must find all peptides for which $n_{mc} \\le 1$, or $j - i - 1 \\le 1$, which simplifies to $j - i \\le 2$.\n\nWe enumerate all pairs $(i, j)$ satisfying $0 \\le i < j \\le 2$ and $j-i \\le 2$:\n\n-   **Case $n_{mc}=0$ (no missed cleavages):** This corresponds to $j-i-1=0$, or $j = i+1$.\n    -   For $i=0, j=1$: The peptide is formed between boundaries $p_0$ and $p_1$. This is the sequence from the N-terminus up to and including $\\mathrm{K(2)}$.\n        Peptide 1: $\\mathrm{AK}$\n    -   For $i=1, j=2$: The peptide is formed between boundaries $p_1$ and $p_2$. This is the sequence from $\\mathrm{R(3)}$ to the C-terminus.\n        Peptide 2: $\\mathrm{RPQK}$\n\n-   **Case $n_{mc}=1$ (one missed cleavage):** This corresponds to $j-i-1=1$, or $j = i+2$.\n    -   For $i=0, j=2$: The peptide is formed between boundaries $p_0$ and $p_2$.

The discussion does not alter the required numerical final answer.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fold-change in the site-specific occupancy of a glycoprotein in a case–control study. The solution requires a straightforward application of the provided definitions and relationships.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the given quantities.\nThe site-specific occupancy, denoted by $f$, is defined as the ratio of the molar abundance of the glycopeptide, $G$, to the molar abundance of the total protein, $P$.\n$$f = \\frac{G}{P}$$\nThe subscript $0$ will denote the control condition, and the subscript $1$ will denote the case condition.\nThus, the site-specific occupancy in the control group is:\n$$f_{0} = \\frac{G_{0}}{P_{0}}$$\nAnd the site-specific occupancy in the case group is:\n$$f_{1} = \\frac{G_{1}}{P_{1}}$$\nThe problem provides the relationships between the case and control abundances:\nThe total protein abundance in cases is $20\\%$ higher than in controls, which is mathematically stated as:\n$$P_{1} = P_{0} + 0.20 P_{0} = 1.2 P_{0}$$\nThe glycoform abundance in cases is $100\\%$ higher than in controls, which is stated as:\n$$G_{1} = G_{0} + 1.00 G_{0} = 2.0 G_{0}$$\nThe objective is to compute the fold-change, $F$, in site-specific occupancy, which is defined as the ratio of the case occupancy to the control occupancy:\n$$F = \\frac{f_{1}}{f_{0}}$$\nWe can now substitute the expressions for $f_{1}$ and $f_{0}$ into the equation for $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{G_{1}}{P_{1}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{G_{0}}{P_{0}}\\right)}$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to group the ratios of like-quantities:\n$$F = \\left(\\frac{G_{1}}{G_{0}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{P_{0}}{P_{1}}\\right)$$\nNow, we use the given relationships between case and control values.

While the total protein level ($P$) increases by a modest $20\\%$ (a $1.2$-fold change), the site-specific occupancy ($f$) increases by approximately $67\\%$ (a $\\frac{5}{3} \\approx 1.67$-fold change). This demonstrates that the process of glycosylation at this specific site is altered to a much greater extent than the overall production of the protein. The change in protein abundance and the change in its modification are \"decoupled.\" In a clinical diagnostic setting, a biomarker's utility depends on its ability to clearly distinguish between states (e.g., case vs. control). A large fold-change is generally more robust and provides better discriminatory power. In this scenario, the change in site-specific occupancy ($f$) is a more pronounced signal than the change in total protein abundance ($P$). Therefore, measuring $f$ (which requires quantifying both $G$ and $P$) provides a potentially more sensitive and specific biomarker for the disease. A patient stratification strategy based on occupancy could identify a subset of patients with highly dysregulated glycosylation pathways, which may correlate with disease severity, prognosis, or response to targeted therapies aimed at those pathways.
