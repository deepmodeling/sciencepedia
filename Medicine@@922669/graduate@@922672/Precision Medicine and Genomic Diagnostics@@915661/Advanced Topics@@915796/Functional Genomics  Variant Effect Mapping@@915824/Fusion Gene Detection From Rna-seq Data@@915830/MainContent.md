## Introduction
The detection of gene fusions—chimeric transcripts formed by the joining of two previously separate genes—is a pivotal task in modern genomic medicine, particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. These events can create potent oncogenic drivers, making their accurate identification a clinical imperative. However, gleaning true fusion events from a sea of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data is a significant bioinformatic challenge, fraught with technical artifacts and biological mimics that can lead to false discoveries. This article provides a comprehensive guide to navigating this complex landscape.

The journey begins in **Principles and Mechanisms**, where we will dissect the molecular origins of fusion transcripts and the two primary forms of evidence they leave in RNA-seq data: [split reads](@entry_id:175063) and spanning pairs. We will explore the computational algorithms designed to capture this evidence and the critical filters used to distinguish genuine fusions from a host of artifacts. Next, in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, we will transition from theory to practice, examining how high-confidence fusion calls are used in clinical workflows to guide targeted therapies, monitor disease, and even discover novel tumor-specific neoantigens for [immunotherapy](@entry_id:150458). Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section will offer practical problems to solidify your understanding of key bioinformatic challenges, from reconstructing a junction to assessing a fusion's functional impact. By the end, you will have a robust framework for detecting, validating, and interpreting gene fusions from RNA-seq data.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The detection of gene fusions from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data is a cornerstone of modern genomic diagnostics, particularly in oncology. It represents a complex bioinformatic challenge that requires a deep understanding of molecular biology, sequencing technology, and [statistical inference](@entry_id:172747). This chapter elucidates the core principles and mechanisms that govern the generation of fusion transcripts and their subsequent identification from sequence data. We will begin by establishing the fundamental types of evidence found in RNA-seq data, proceed to the computational strategies used to detect and characterize fusion events, address the critical task of distinguishing true fusions from a diverse array of artifacts, explore the functional consequences that make these events potent oncogenic drivers, and conclude by examining the impact of evolving sequencing technologies on this field.

### The Molecular Basis of Gene Fusions and Their Signatures in RNA-Seq Data

A gene fusion originates from a genomic [structural variant](@entry_id:164220) (SV)—such as a translocation, deletion, or inversion—that juxtaposes two previously separate genes. According to [the central dogma of molecular biology](@entry_id:194488), this rearranged DNA template is transcribed into a single precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). The cellular splicing machinery then processes this chimeric pre-mRNA, potentially removing [introns](@entry_id:144362) and ligating exons from both parent genes to create a mature, chimeric mRNA molecule. When this fusion transcript is sampled during RNA-seq library preparation, it gives rise to characteristic signatures in the sequencing data.

In the context of paired-end short-read sequencing, two primary forms of evidence are used to infer the presence of a fusion transcript: **[split reads](@entry_id:175063)** and **spanning pairs** [@problem_id:4342745]. Understanding their distinct origins and bioinformatic signatures is fundamental.

A **split read** is a single sequencing read that physically crosses the fusion breakpoint. One portion of the read sequence originates from the 5' partner gene, while the remaining portion originates from the 3' partner gene. When a splice-aware aligner attempts to map such a read to the [reference genome](@entry_id:269221), it cannot find a single, contiguous locus to place the entire sequence. Instead, the aligner reports the read's location in multiple pieces. Typically, this is represented in the Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format as a **primary alignment** for the longest mappable segment and one or more **supplementary alignments** for the other segments. The supplementary alignment information is stored in the `SA` tag of the SAM record. The CIGAR (Concise Idiosyncratic Gapped Alignment Report) string for the primary alignment will often show **soft-clipping**, where a portion of the read at one end is marked as unaligned (e.g., a CIGAR of `80M70S` indicates 80 bases matched and 70 bases at the end were clipped). The corresponding supplementary alignment for that same read would then map those 70 bases to the fusion partner gene, often with a CIGAR like `80S70M`. Critically, this signature is distinct from that of a canonical splice junction within a single gene. An intra-gene splice is represented as a single alignment record where the CIGAR string uses the `$N$` operator to signify a large gap corresponding to a skipped [intron](@entry_id:152563) (e.g., `75M10000N75M`). The use of supplementary alignments for fusions reflects the non-colinear nature of the event in the [reference genome](@entry_id:269221). Because a split read contains the exact nucleotide sequence of the junction, it provides the highest possible resolution, pinpointing the fusion breakpoint to the single-base level [@problem_id:4342725].

A **spanning pair**, also known as a discordant read pair, provides indirect but powerful evidence of a fusion. In this case, the cDNA fragment from which the read pair was sequenced spans the fusion breakpoint, but both of the reads themselves fall entirely within one of the two partner genes. For instance, the first read ($R_1$) maps perfectly to an exon in the 5' partner gene, and the second read ($R_2$) maps perfectly to an exon in the 3' partner gene. The individual alignments appear normal, but their relationship as a pair is anomalous. If the fusion is **interchromosomal**, the reads will map to different chromosomes, a clear discordant signal. If the fusion is **intrachromosomal**, the reads will map to the same chromosome but will be separated by a genomic distance far greater than expected from the library's insert size distribution. For a library with a mean insert size of $\mu=350$ bp and standard deviation $\sigma=50$ bp, a normal pair should have an inferred template length ($TLEN$) where $|TLEN| \approx 350$ bp. A spanning pair supporting an intragenic fusion might have a $|TLEN|$ of many thousands or millions of base pairs, far exceeding any reasonable threshold like $\mu + 3\sigma$. Furthermore, the relative orientation of the mapped reads (e.g., forward-forward instead of the expected forward-reverse) can also be discordant depending on the underlying [genomic rearrangement](@entry_id:184390). Spanning pairs constrain the breakpoint to the unsequenced region between the two mapped reads but do not, by themselves, resolve the exact junction sequence [@problem_id:4342745].

### Computational Strategies for Fusion Detection

Identifying fusions requires a sophisticated computational pipeline that moves from raw read alignments to high-confidence fusion calls. This process involves strategic alignment choices, precise breakpoint characterization, and robust statistical scoring.

#### Alignment and Evidence Gathering

The initial and most crucial step is the alignment of RNA-seq reads. This is performed by **splice-aware aligners** such as STAR or HISAT2. A key decision is whether to align reads to a [reference genome](@entry_id:269221) or a reference [transcriptome](@entry_id:274025) (a collection of all known transcript sequences) [@problem_id:4342728].

**Genome-based alignment** is the preferred strategy for discovering **novel fusions**. By mapping reads against the entire genome, the aligner is not constrained by existing gene annotations. It can identify [split reads](@entry_id:175063) that connect any two genomic loci, thereby enabling the detection of previously unknown exon-exon junctions or fusions involving intergenic or intronic regions. However, this flexibility comes at a cost. The vast search space of the genome increases the risk of spurious alignments, particularly due to repetitive sequences and gene paralogs. To mitigate this, robust fusion callers require a sufficiently long and unique "anchor" sequence on each side of a putative split read's breakpoint to ensure the alignment is not an artifact [@problem_id:4342728].

**Transcriptome-based alignment**, in contrast, is faster and can be effective for detecting fusions between known exons of known genes. However, it is fundamentally incapable of discovering novel fusions, as its reference space is limited to an existing catalog of transcripts. A common misconception is that this approach eliminates the problem of ambiguous mapping; however, paralogous genes that share identical exon sequences still cause multi-mapping issues even within the [transcriptome](@entry_id:274025) [@problem_id:4342728].

#### Breakpoint Characterization and Validation

Once split-read evidence identifies a candidate fusion, the next step is to precisely characterize the **transcript-level fusion breakpoint**: the exact nucleotide position where the sequence transitions from the 5' partner to the 3' partner. This process must also account for the possibility of **microinsertions** or **microdeletions** at the junction, which can arise from the DNA repair mechanisms that created the original [structural variant](@entry_id:164220).

A robust workflow for this task involves several steps [@problem_id:4342725]. First, all reads supporting the junction ([split reads](@entry_id:175063) and their soft-clipped portions) are collected. Second, to resolve the precise junction sequence including potential small insertions or deletions (indels), a sensitive gapped local alignment algorithm, such as **Smith-Waterman with affine [gap penalties](@entry_id:165662)**, is employed. This method finds the optimal alignment between the read sequence and a virtual reference constructed by concatenating the partner gene sequences, explicitly modeling the cost of opening a gap versus extending it. Third, to build a high-confidence [consensus sequence](@entry_id:167516) and overcome sequencing errors in any single read, **local [de novo assembly](@entry_id:172264)** is performed on the collection of junction-supporting reads. This reconstructs the junction sequence from its constituent [k-mers](@entry_id:166084) without reliance on the reference. Finally, in any clinical or high-impact research setting, the bioinformatically predicted fusion junction must be experimentally validated using an orthogonal method. The gold standard is targeted amplification of the junction from cDNA using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), followed by **Sanger sequencing** to confirm the exact nucleotide sequence [@problem_id:4342725].

#### Algorithmic Approaches of Fusion Callers

Moving from a collection of supporting reads to a final, confident fusion call requires an algorithm to score the evidence and filter out artifacts. Fusion-calling tools employ diverse algorithmic philosophies to achieve this balance between sensitivity and specificity [@problem_id:4342787].

1.  **Breakpoint-Centric Clustering and Filtering:** This is the most common approach, exemplified by tools like **STAR-Fusion** and **FusionCatcher**. These methods first identify candidate breakpoints from [split reads](@entry_id:175063) and [discordant pairs](@entry_id:166371). They then "cluster" all supporting evidence for each unique breakpoint, counting the number of supporting [split reads](@entry_id:175063) and spanning pairs. The decision to call a fusion is then based on applying a series of thresholds and rule-based filters. For example, a call might require a minimum number of [split reads](@entry_id:175063), a minimum number of spanning pairs, and must not match filters designed to remove known artifacts (e.g., fusions involving mitochondrial genes or immunoglobulin genes).

2.  **Probabilistic Modeling:** An alternative approach, pioneered by tools like **deFuse**, is to frame the problem in a [statistical classification](@entry_id:636082) framework. Instead of relying on a series of hard thresholds, this method extracts a wide range of features from the evidence for a candidate fusion. These features might include read counts, alignment scores, mapping qualities, [sequence complexity](@entry_id:175320) around the breakpoint, and fragment length distributions. A **probabilistic model**, such as a [logistic regression](@entry_id:136386) classifier, is then used to combine these features to compute a posterior probability, $P(\text{Fusion} | \text{Evidence})$, that the candidate represents a true event. This provides a single, unified score that statistically weighs all available evidence.

### Distinguishing True Fusions from Artifacts

A major challenge in fusion detection is the high frequency of false positives that arise from a variety of biological, technical, and bioinformatic sources. A proficient analyst must be able to recognize the signatures of these artifacts and distinguish them from genuine genomic rearrangements [@problem_id:4342712], [@problem_id:4342717].

#### Biological Mimics (Non-Rearrangement Events)

Some observed chimeric transcripts are real biological products but do not arise from a DNA-level [structural variant](@entry_id:164220).

*   **Read-through Transcription:** When two genes are located adjacently on the same chromosome and are transcribed in the same direction, the RNA polymerase may occasionally fail to terminate at the end of the first gene and continue transcribing into the second. The resulting long pre-mRNA can then be spliced by the canonical [spliceosome](@entry_id:138521) to join an exon from the upstream gene to one from the downstream gene. Signatures include: the genes are colinear and proximal (e.g.,  30 kb apart), the junction uses canonical splice sites, continuous RNA-seq read coverage is often visible in the intergenic region, and, most importantly, Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) shows no underlying SV [@problem_id:4342717].

*   **Circular RNAs (circRNAs):** These are generated by a "[back-splicing](@entry_id:187945)" event, where a splice donor at a downstream exon is joined to a splice acceptor at an upstream exon of the same gene. This creates a covalently closed RNA loop. The signature in RNA-seq is a split read that appears to connect a later exon back to an earlier one in a head-to-tail fashion. Like read-throughs, circRNAs are an RNA-level phenomenon and are not associated with a DNA SV [@problem_id:4342717].

*   **Trans-splicing:** In rare cases, the splicing machinery can join exons from two completely separate pre-mRNA transcripts. This can produce chimeric transcripts between genes on different chromosomes without a corresponding DNA translocation. Distinguishing features include the presence of canonical splice sites, the absence of a DNA SV in WGS, and sometimes the observation of the same event at low levels in normal tissues, suggesting a physiological process [@problem_id:4342712].

#### Technical and Bioinformatic Artifacts

These artifacts are not real biological molecules but are generated during library preparation or data analysis.

*   **PCR Chimeras:** During the PCR amplification step of library construction, an incompletely extended DNA strand can act as a primer on a different template, creating a chimeric molecule. This single artifact is then amplified exponentially. The key signature is that the fusion support is dominated by reads with identical start and end mapping coordinates, which are flagged as PCR duplicates. Removing these duplicates will cause the support for the fusion to collapse. The use of Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) can definitively identify and remove these artifacts [@problem_id:4342712].

*   **Reverse Transcriptase (RT) Template Switching:** During the initial [reverse transcription](@entry_id:141572) of RNA to cDNA, the RT enzyme can dissociate from one RNA template and re-initiate synthesis on another, creating a chimeric cDNA. These events are often mediated by short stretches of microhomology between the two templates. Their signatures include an enrichment for microhomology at the breakpoint and a disproportionate number of junctions near the 5' ends of transcripts, where the RT is more likely to fall off [@problem_id:4342712].

*   **Homologous Mapping Artifacts:** The genome is replete with repetitive sequences (e.g., LINEs, SINEs) and gene families with highly similar sequences (paralogs). Short reads originating from these regions can be ambiguously mapped. An aligner may incorrectly place a read from one gene onto a paralog, sometimes creating a spurious split-[read alignment](@entry_id:265329) that mimics a fusion. The primary indicator of this artifact is a low **Mapping Quality (MAPQ)** score, which is a Phred-scaled probability that the alignment is incorrect. For example, a MAPQ of 10 means there is a 1 in 10 chance the mapping is wrong. A [robust filtering](@entry_id:754387) strategy is essential to handle this. One can implement a weighted scoring system where the contribution of each supporting read is down-weighted by its ambiguity, for instance, by penalizing reads with low MAPQ or high "multiplicity" (the number of equally good mapping locations) [@problem_id:4342695].

Ultimately, the gold standard for confirming a true, somatic, cancer-driving fusion is to demonstrate that it is present only in the tumor sample (not matched normal), is supported by multiple unique, high-quality reads, and corresponds to a detectable [structural variant](@entry_id:164220) in the tumor's genomic DNA via WGS or targeted gDNA PCR [@problem_id:4342712].

### Functional Consequences and Oncogenic Mechanisms

Gene fusions are potent oncogenic drivers because they create novel proteins with deregulated activity or expression patterns. The two most well-characterized classes are fusions involving kinases and those involving transcription factors [@problem_id:4342767].

#### Constitutively Active Kinase Fusions

A canonical oncogenic kinase fusion joins a 5' partner gene that provides a **constitutive oligomerization domain** (e.g., a [coiled-coil domain](@entry_id:183301)) to a 3' partner that is a protein kinase, retaining its **intact catalytic domain**. Normal [receptor tyrosine kinases](@entry_id:137841) require binding to an external ligand to induce [dimerization](@entry_id:271116) or oligomerization, which brings their intracellular kinase domains into proximity, allowing them to phosphorylate and activate each other in *trans*. The [fusion protein](@entry_id:181766) bypasses this regulation. The fused oligomerization domain forces the kinase domains into a permanent state of close proximity, leading to constitutive [trans-autophosphorylation](@entry_id:172524) and unrelenting, ligand-independent downstream signaling that drives cell proliferation and survival [@problem_id:4342767].

#### Chimeric Transcription Factor Fusions

Transcription factor fusions create aberrant regulators of gene expression. A common mechanism involves fusing the **DNA-binding domain (DBD)** of one transcription factor to the potent **transactivation domain (TAD)** of another. The resulting chimeric protein is a powerful new transcription factor that binds to the target genes of the DBD partner but then uses the potent, hijacked TAD to abnormally activate (or repress) their expression. This rewires the cell's transcriptional program, leading to oncogenesis. This effect is often compounded by **promoter swapping**, where the fusion event places the new chimeric gene under the control of a strong, constitutively active promoter from the 5' partner gene, leading to its massive overexpression [@problem_id:4342767].

This phenomenon can be modeled quantitatively. The expression level of a gene can be described by its transcription rate, which is a function of activator and repressor concentrations, and its mRNA degradation rate. A fusion involving promoter swapping replaces the native regulatory landscape of the 3' partner's coding sequence with that of the 5' partner's promoter. If the 5' partner's promoter is highly active in a given tissue (i.e., high activator levels, low repressor levels) where the 3' partner is normally silent, the result is strong **ectopic expression**. By modeling [transcription factor binding](@entry_id:270185) with Hill-type functions, one can derive the precise conditions—in terms of activator concentrations and binding affinities—under which the fusion transcript's steady-state level will exceed that of the native gene by a given [fold-change](@entry_id:272598), thereby formalizing the concept of ectopic activation [@problem_id:4342769].

### The Role of Evolving Sequencing Technologies: Short vs. Long Reads

The choice of sequencing technology has profound implications for the sensitivity and specificity of fusion detection. The field has been dominated by short-read platforms (e.g., Illumina), but long-read technologies (e.g., PacBio, Oxford Nanopore) offer distinct advantages [@problem_id:4342700].

**Short-Read Sequencing (e.g., Illumina):** The primary strength of short-read RNA-seq is its immense throughput and low per-base error rate (typically 0.1%). The massive depth (e.g., >100 million read pairs) allows for sensitive detection of transcripts, even those expressed at low levels. For a moderately expressed fusion, deep short-read sequencing will likely generate more total supporting reads (both split and spanning) than a long-read experiment with lower throughput. However, its fundamental limitation is the short read length (typically 75-150 bp). This makes it extremely difficult to unambiguously resolve fusions whose breakpoints lie in repetitive or [low-complexity regions](@entry_id:176542). It also cannot, from a single read, determine the full-length isoform structure of a fusion transcript, making it hard to phase the breakpoint with distal exons.

**Long-Read Sequencing (e.g., PacBio Iso-Seq, ONT Direct RNA):** The transformative advantage of long-read technology is its ability to sequence entire mRNA molecules from end to end in a single read. This provides **full-length, isoform-resolved evidence**. For fusion detection, this means a single read can capture the 5' end of the first partner, the exact fusion breakpoint, and the 3' end of the second partner. This ability to "phase" the breakpoint with unique exons far upstream or downstream provides the contextual information needed to unambiguously map reads even when the breakpoint itself is in a repetitive region. This dramatically increases the positive predictive value (PPV) and reduces false positives from mapping ambiguity.

However, there are trade-offs. Long-read platforms historically have had lower throughput and higher per-base error rates. While PacBio HiFi reads have improved accuracy significantly (~99%), they are still less accurate than Illumina reads. ONT reads can have higher error rates (>1-5%), which poses a challenge for alignment, though this is mitigated by analyzing the consensus of multiple reads. Furthermore, methods based on cDNA (Illumina, PacBio) are susceptible to RT and PCR artifacts, while **direct RNA sequencing** (ONT) avoids these steps, leading to a lower rate of chimeric artifacts and a potentially higher PPV still.

In a direct comparison for a lowly expressed fusion in a repetitive context, a typical outcome might be [@problem_id:4342700]:
*   **Sensitivity:** Illumina may yield the highest number of raw supporting reads due to superior depth.
*   **Specificity (PPV):** Long-read methods will have a much higher PPV. ONT direct RNA may have the highest PPV of all due to both its full-length nature (solving mapping ambiguity) and its avoidance of cDNA-based artifacts.

The optimal strategy depends on the specific goals of the analysis, balancing the need for raw sensitivity against the critical importance of high-confidence, unambiguous fusion calls.
