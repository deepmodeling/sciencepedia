The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, values, and formulas to arrive at a unique conclusion. The terminology is precise and objective. There are no logical contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities in the problem statement. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation of the Solution**\n\nFirst, I will determine the SIFT classification for the given substitution.\nThe prediction rule states that a substitution is deleterious if $\\hat{p} \\le \\tau$.\nWe are given $\\hat{p} = 0.02$ and $\\tau = 0.05$.\nSince $0.02 \\le 0.05$, the substitution is classified as **deleterious**.\n\nNext, I will characterize the uncertainty of this classification. The uncertainty is related to the width of the confidence interval for the true probability $p$. A wider interval implies higher uncertainty. The confidence in the deleterious call is high if the entire $95\\%$ confidence interval for $p$ is below the threshold $\\tau$. Since $\\hat{p}  \\tau$, this is equivalent to the condition that the upper bound of the confidence interval is less than or equal to $\\tau$.\n\nThe upper $95\\%$ confidence bound for $p$ is given by:\n$$p_{\\text{upper}} = \\hat{p} + 1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n_{\\mathrm{eff}}}}$$\n\nFor the deleterious call to be considered high-confidence (at the $95\\%$ level), we require $p_{\\text{upper}} \\le \\tau$. Let's determine the condition on $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for this to hold.\nSubstituting the given values $\\hat{p} = 0.02$ and $\\tau = 0.05$:\n$$0.02 + 1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{0.02(1-0.02)}{n_{\\mathrm{eff}}}} \\le 0.05$$\n\nNow, I will solve this inequality for $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{0.02(0.98)}{n_{\\mathrm{eff}}}} \\le 0.05 - 0.02$$\n$$1.96 \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0196}{n_{\\mathrm{eff}}}} \\le 0.03$$\n$$\\sqrt{\\frac{0.0196}{n_{\\mathrm{eff}}}} \\le \\frac{0.03}{1.96}$$\n\nSquaring both sides of the inequality:\n$$\\frac{0.0196}{n_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\le \\left(\\frac{0.03}{1.96}\\right)^2$$\n\nTo solve for $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, we can invert the inequality (which reverses the inequality sign):\n$$\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{0.0196} \\ge \\left(\\frac{1.96}{0.03}\\right)^2$$\n$$n_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\ge 0.0196 \\times \\left(\\frac{1.96}{0.03}\\right)^2$$\n\nNow, I will calculate the numerical value:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\ge 0.0196 \\times (65.333...)^2$$\n$$n_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\ge 0.0196 \\times 4268.444...$$\n$$n_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\ge 83.6615...$$\n\nThis means that for the upper $95\\%$ confidence bound to be at or below the threshold of $0.05$, the effective number of sequences $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ must be at least approximately $84$. If $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is smaller than this value, the confidence interval for $p$ will contain the threshold $\\tau = 0.05$, indicating that we cannot be $95\\%$ confident that the true probability $p$ is less than $0.05$. In such a case, the deleterious prediction would be flagged as having low confidence.\n\nThe analysis shows that larger alignment depth ($n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) leads to a narrower confidence interval, which reduces uncertainty and increases confidence in the prediction, provided the point estimate is not too close to the threshold.\n\n**Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA.

This directly follows from the properties of confidence intervals.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. The substitution is predicted tolerated because $\\hat{p} = 0.02$ is smaller than $\\tau = 0.05$, and lower alignment depth reduces false negatives, increasing confidence in tolerance.\n- The classification as \"tolerated\" is incorrect. According to the rule $\\hat{p} \\le \\tau$, the prediction is \"deleterious\".\n- The statement that lower alignment depth increases confidence is incorrect. Lower alignment depth (smaller $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) increases the variance of the estimate, widens the confidence interval, and therefore *decreases* confidence.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. The substitution is predicted deleterious; uncertainty is minimized at low $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ because fewer sequences reduce sampling noise, so confidence increases as $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ decreases.\n- The classification as deleterious is correct.\n- The statement that uncertainty is minimized at low $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is fundamentally incorrect. From the formula for the variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{p}) \\approx p(1-p)/n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, it is clear that variance (a measure of uncertainty) is inversely proportional to $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. Thus, uncertainty increases as $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ decreases. The claim that fewer sequences reduce sampling noise is the opposite of a basic statistical principle.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. The result is inconclusive regardless of $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ because SIFT scores below $\\tau$ cannot be trusted without a functional assay; alignment depth does not inform uncertainty in any principled way.\n- The claim that the result is inconclusive is contrary to the problem statement, which provides a deterministic rule for classification based on the threshold $\\tau$.\n- The claim that alignment depth ($n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) does not inform uncertainty in a principled way is false. The problem explicitly provides a statistical model where the confidence interval width, and thus uncertainty, is a direct inverse function of $\\sqrt{n_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$. This is a standard and principled way to model uncertainty.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only option A is fully consistent with the problem statement and correct principles of statistics.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4371763"}, {"introduction": "In a real-world clinical setting, variant interpretation is rarely based on a single predictive score; instead, it involves synthesizing multiple, independent lines of evidence.
