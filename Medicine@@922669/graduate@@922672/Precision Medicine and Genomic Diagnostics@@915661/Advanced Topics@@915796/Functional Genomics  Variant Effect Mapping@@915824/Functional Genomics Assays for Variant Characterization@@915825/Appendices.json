Let $[S]_{\\text{total}}$ be the total concentration of binding sites. By conservation of mass for the sites:\n$$[S]_{\\text{total}} = [S] + [C]$$\nwhere $[S]$ is the concentration of free (unoccupied) sites and $[C]$ is the concentration of the transcription factor-DNA complex (occupied sites).\n\n$P_{\\text{bound}}$ is then defined as:\n$$P_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{[C]}{[S]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[C]}{[S] + [C]}$$\nThe dissociation constant $K_d$ is given by the law of mass action for the dissociation reaction $C \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{TF} + S$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[\\mathrm{TF}][S]}{[C]}$$\nWe can rearrange this expression to solve for the concentration of free sites, $[S]$:\n$$[S] = \\frac{K_d [C]}{[\\mathrm{TF}]}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[S]$ into the equation for $P_{\\text{bound}}$:\n$$P_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{[C]}{\\frac{K_d [C]}{[\\mathrm{TF}]} + [C]}$$\nThe term $[C]$ is present in the numerator and in both terms of the denominator, so it can be cancelled:\n$$P_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[\\mathrm{TF}]} + 1}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[\\mathrm{TF}]$ yields the standard form of the single-site binding isotherm (or Hill-Langmuir equation):\n$$P_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{TF}]}{[\\mathrm{TF}] + K_d}$$\nThe problem states that the free transcription factor is not appreciably depleted by binding, which validates treating $[\\mathrm{TF}]$ as a constant parameter equal to the supplied concentration.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the leading-order expression for the fold-change $\\frac{r^{\\text{var}}}{r^{\\text{ref}}}$**\n\nThe transcription rate $r$ is proportional to $P_{\\text{bound}}$, with a proportionality constant $k_{\\max}$:\n$$r = k_{\\max} P_{\\text{bound}} = k_{\\max} \\frac{[\\mathrm{TF}]}{[\\mathrm{TF}] + K_d}$$\nWe are comparing a reference allele and a variant allele of the same binding site.

Therefore, we assume $k_{\\max}$ is the same for both alleles: $k_{\\max}^{\\text{ref}} = k_{\\max}^{\\text{var}} = k_{\\max}$.\n\nThe transcription rates for the variant and reference alleles are:\n$$r^{\\text{var}} = k_{\\max} \\frac{[\\mathrm{TF}]}{[\\mathrm{TF}] + K_d^{\\text{var}}}$$\n$$r^{\\text{ref}} = k_{\\max} \\frac{[\\mathrm{TF}]}{[\\mathrm{TF}] + K_d^{\\text{ref}}}$$\nThe fold-change is the ratio of these two rates:\n$$\\frac{r^{\\text{var}}}{r^{\\text{ref}}} = \\frac{k_{\\max} \\frac{[\\mathrm{TF}]}{[\\mathrm{TF}] + K_d^{\\text{var}}}}{k_{\\max} \\frac{[\\mathrm{TF}]}{[\\mathrm{TF}] + K_d^{\\text{ref}}}}$$\nCanceling the common terms $k_{\\max}$ and $[\\mathrm{TF}]$ gives the exact expression for the fold-change:\n$$\\frac{r^{\\text{var}}}{r^{\\text{ref}}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{TF}] + K_d^{\\text{ref}}}{[\\mathrm{TF}] + K_d^{\\text{var}}}$$\nThe problem asks for the *leading-order expression* under the limiting concentration assumption $[\\mathrm{TF}] \\ll K_d$ for both alleles. In this limit, the binding probability simplifies.

Let the two alleles be denoted as allele $A$ and allele $B$.

It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective question that can be solved using the provided information. I will proceed with the derivation and evaluation.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe problem requires isolating the per-copy transcriptional difference, represented by the ratio of transcription rates $e_A / e_B$, from measurements confounded by DNA copy number differences, $c_A / c_B$.\n\n1.  **Modeling the DNA and RNA Ratios**:\n    Based on the problem statement, the observed read counts are estimators of the underlying molecular quantities.\n    *   The ratio of DNA copy numbers, $c_A / c_B$, is directly reflected in the DNA allelic read ratio. We can thus state the approximation:\n        $$ \\frac{c_A}{c_B} \\approx \\frac{d_A}{d_B} $$\n    *   The total transcriptional output of an allele is the product of its copy number and its per-copy transcription rate. Therefore, the ratio of RNA transcripts is:\n        $$ \\frac{\\text{RNA from A}}{\\text{RNA from B}} = \\frac{c_A \\cdot e_A}{c_B \\cdot e_B} $$\n    *   This true RNA ratio is estimated by the observed RNA read count ratio:\n        $$ \\frac{c_A \\cdot e_A}{c_B \\cdot e_B} \\approx \\frac{r_A}{r_B} $$\n\n2.  **Deriving the Normalization Formula**:\n    Our goal is to find the ratio of per-copy transcription rates, $e_A / e_B$. We can rearrange the RNA ratio equation:\n    $$ \\frac{r_A}{r_B} \\approx \\frac{c_A \\cdot e_A}{c_B \\cdot e_B} = \\left(\\frac{c_A}{c_B}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{e_A}{e_B}\\right) $$\n    To isolate the term of interest, $e_A / e_B$, we divide the observed RNA ratio by the DNA copy number ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{e_A}{e_B} \\approx \\frac{r_A / r_B}{c_A / c_B} $$\n    Substituting the estimator for the DNA copy number ratio, we get the formula for the normalized ASE, which represents the true per-copy transcriptional difference:\n    $$ \\text{Normalized ASE ratio} = \\frac{r_A / r_B}{d_A / d_B} $$\n    If this ratio equals $1$, it implies $e_A \\approx e_B$, indicating no per-copy allele-specific expression. If it deviates from $1$, it suggests a true regulatory difference between the alleles.\n\n3.  **Logarithmic Transformation**:\n    For statistical purposes and easier interpretation, ratios are often log-transformed. Using base-$2$ logarithm:\n    $$ \\Delta = \\log_2\\left(\\text{Normalized ASE ratio}\\right) = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{r_A / r_B}{d_A / d_B}\\right) $$\n    Using the property $\\log(x/y) = \\log(x) - \\log(y)$, this becomes:\n    $$ \\Delta = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{r_A}{r_B}\\right) - \\log_2\\left(\\frac{d_A}{d_B}\\right) $$\n    In this form, $\\Delta = 0$ signifies no per-copy ASE.\n\n4.  **Applying to Loci Data**:\n\n    *   **Locus $1$**:\n        *   DNA ratio: $d_A / d_B = 80 / 20 = 4$.\n        *   RNA ratio: $r_A / r_B = 240 / 60 = 4$.\n        *   Normalized ASE ratio: $\\frac{4}{4} = 1$.\n        *   Log-transformed value: $\\Delta = \\log_2(1) = 0$.\n        *   **Interpretation**: The observed $4:1$ imbalance in RNA reads is fully explained by the $4:1$ imbalance in DNA copy number. There is no evidence of a per-copy transcriptional difference ($e_A = e_B$).\n\n    *   **Locus $2$**:\n        *   DNA ratio: $d_A / d_B = 50 / 50 = 1$.\n        *   RNA ratio: $r_A / r_B = 180 / 120 = 1.5$.\n        *   Normalized ASE ratio: $\\frac{1.5}{1} = 1.5$.\n        *   Log-transformed value: $\\Delta = \\log_2(1.5) \\approx 0.585$.\n        *   **Interpretation**: Since the DNA copy number is balanced ($1:1$), the observed $1.5:1$ imbalance in RNA reads is entirely attributable to a per-copy transcriptional difference. The transcription rate of allele $A$ is $1.5$ times that of allele $B$ ($e_A = 1.5 \\cdot e_B$). This represents true regulatory ASE.\n\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **Option A**: This option states that CNV scales the RNA allelic ratio and proposes the normalization $\\frac{r_A / r_B}{d_A / d_B}$ or its log-equivalent $\\Delta = \\log_2(r_A/r_B) - \\log_2(d_A/d_B)$. This exactly matches our derivation. It then states that for locus $1$, the normalized ratio is $1$ ($\\Delta = 0$), indicating no per-copy ASE. This matches our calculation. It further states that for locus $2$, the normalized ratio is $1.5$ ($\\Delta \\approx 0.585$), indicating per-copy ASE favoring allele $A$. This also matches our calculation and interpretation.\n    **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n*   **Option B**: This option claims \"CNV affects only DNA counts but not RNA counts\". This premise is fundamentally incorrect, as established in the problem statement and our derivation; RNA abundance is a function of both copy number and transcription rate. The proposed subtraction of proportions, $\\frac{r_A}{r_A + r_B} - \\frac{d_A}{d_A + d_B}$, is a different mathematical approach that is inconsistent with the multiplicative model implied by the problem's principles. While its calculation for locus $1$ yields $0$, its conclusion of \"minimal ASE\" for locus $2$ is an arbitrary interpretation of the value $0.1$. The foundational premise is flawed.\n    **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C**: This option claims \"CNV can be ignored\". This directly contradicts the problem's objective, which is to correct for the confounding effect of CNV. The proposed test—comparing the RNA proportion $r_A / (r_A + r_B)$ to $0.5$—is the standard method for detecting ASE *without* accounting for CNV. This approach would incorrectly conclude that locus $1$ has strong ASE, when the effect is due to copy number. Therefore, the method is inappropriate for the stated goal.\n    **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option D**: This option proposes normalizing the RNA allelic ratio by the *total* DNA read count: $\\frac{r_A / r_B}{d_A + d_B}$. This formula is conceptually and dimensionally flawed. One cannot correct a ratio by dividing it by a sum (a raw count). The confounding effect of the DNA allelic *ratio* must be corrected by dividing by the DNA allelic *ratio*. The formula does not achieve the goal of isolating the per-copy expression difference. The resulting interpretations for the loci are based on this flawed calculation and are therefore invalid.\n    **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4342341"}, {"introduction": "To understand genome function at scale, we turn to high-throughput assays like pooled CRISPR screens, which generate vast amounts of data linking genetic perturbations to cellular phenotypes.

Weighted least squares yields\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} = \\left(\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{y},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{y}$ is the vector of $\\ell_i$, $\\mathbf{X}$ is the design matrix with a column of ones (intercept) and one-hot indicators for each gene excluding the baseline, and $\\mathbf{W}$ is diagonal with entries $w_i = 1/\\sigma_i^2$.\n\nTask:\nWrite a Python program to:\n1. For each provided test case, compute the library-size normalized base-$2$ log fold changes $\\ell_i$ for all gRNAs using the formula above.\n2. Compute the weights $w_i = 1/\\operatorname{Var}(\\ell_i)$ using the variance approximation above.\n3. Construct the design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ with an intercept and one-hot columns for each gene excluding the given baseline gene.\n4. Fit the weighted least squares model to estimate gene-level effects $\\beta_g$ relative to the baseline.\n5. For each test case, output the estimated gene effects in a list ordered lexicographically by gene label excluding the baseline gene. Round each estimated effect to six decimal places.\n\nAssumptions:\n- All counts $c_i(t)$ are nonnegative integers.\n- The pseudocount $s$ is strictly positive and provided.\n- The library sizes $L_{t_0}$ and $L_{t_1}$ are known positive constants for each test case.\n\nAngle units are not applicable. No physical units are used in the answer. All outputs must be floating-point numbers rounded to six decimal places.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$ (general case, multiple guides per gene, balanced library sizes):\n    - Counts at $t_0$: $[1000, 1200, 900, 1100, 800, 850]$\n    - Counts at $t_1$: $[980, 1180, 600, 700, 1200, 1300]$\n    - Gene labels: $[\\text{NTC}, \\text{NTC}, \\text{G1}, \\text{G1}, \\text{G2}, \\text{G2}]$\n    - Baseline gene: $\\text{NTC}$\n    - Library sizes: $(L_{t_0}, L_{t_1}) = (1000000, 1000000)$\n    - Pseudocount: $s = 1$\n- Case $2$ (edge case with zero counts and unequal library sizes):\n    - Counts at $t_0$: $[500, 600, 400, 450]$\n    - Counts at $t_1$: $[520, 590, 0, 10]$\n    - Gene labels: $[\\text{NTC}, \\text{NTC}, \\text{G3}, \\text{G3}]$\n    - Baseline gene: $\\text{NTC}$\n    - Library sizes: $(L_{t_0}, L_{t_1}) = (1000000, 800000)$\n    - Pseudocount: $s = 1$\n- Case $3$ (boundary case with only one guide for a gene):\n    - Counts at $t_0$: $[2000, 2100, 1500]$\n    - Counts at $t_1$: $[1990, 2050, 1600]$\n    - Gene labels: $[\\text{NTC}, \\text{NTC}, \\text{G4}]$\n    - Baseline gene: $\\text{NTC}$\n    - Library sizes: $(L_{t_0}, L_{t_1}) = (2000000, 2000000)$\n    - Pseudocount: $s = 1$\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list of lists enclosed in square brackets, where each inner list corresponds to one test case and contains the estimated gene effects (excluding the baseline) ordered lexicographically by gene label and rounded to six decimals. For example, the printed output must look like\n$$\n[[x_1,x_2],[y_1],[z_1]]\n$$\nwhere $x_i$, $y_i$, and $z_i$ are floats with six decimal places.", "solution": "The problem requires the estimation of gene-level effects from CRISPR pooled screen count data using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM). The provided framework is a standard and statistically sound approach for analyzing such data. The solution proceeds by implementing the specified analysis workflow, which involves data normalization, variance estimation, and fitting a weighted least squares (WLS) model.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in solving the matrix equation for WLS estimation:\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} = \\left(\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{y}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ is the vector of estimated coefficients (intercept and gene effects), $\\mathbf{X}$ is the design matrix, $\\mathbf{W}$ is the diagonal weight matrix, and $\\mathbf{y}$ is the vector of observed log-fold changes.\n\nThe procedure for each test case is as follows:\n\n1.  **Computation of Log-Fold Changes (LFCs)**: The response vector, denoted as $\\mathbf{y}$, consists of the library-size normalized log-base-$2$ fold changes, $\\ell_i$, for each gRNA $i$. Given the raw counts at time $t_0$ and $t_1$, $c_i(t_0)$ and $c_i(t_1)$, the total library sizes $L_{t_0}$ and $L_{t_1}$, and a pseudocount $s > 0$, the LFC for gRNA $i$ is calculated as:\n    $$\n    \\ell_i = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{c_i(t_1)+s}{c_i(t_0)+s}\\right) + \\log_2\\left(\\frac{L_{t_0}}{L_{t_1}}\\right)\n    $$\n    This vector of $\\ell_i$ values forms the response vector $\\mathbf{y}$ in the WLS model.\n\n2.  **Computation of Weights**: The precision of each LFC measurement, $\\ell_i$, depends on the raw read counts. The delta method provides an approximate variance for $\\ell_i$:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_i^2 = \\operatorname{Var}(\\ell_i) \\approx \\frac{1}{(\\ln 2)^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{c_i(t_1)+s} + \\frac{1}{c_i(t_0)+s}\\right)\n    $$\n    In weighted least squares, each observation is weighted by the inverse of its variance to give more influence to more precise measurements. The weight $w_i$ for observation $i$ is thus $w_i = 1/\\sigma_i^2$. These weights form the diagonal elements of the weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}$, where all off-diagonal elements are zero.\n    $$\n    w_i = \\frac{(\\ln 2)^2}{\\frac{1}{c_i(t_1)+s} + \\frac{1}{c_i(t_0)+s}}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Construction of the Design Matrix**: The design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ encodes the relationship between the gRNAs and the gene effects being estimated. The model is:\n    $$\n    \\ell_i = \\alpha + \\sum_{g \\in \\mathcal{G}\\setminus\\{g_{\\text{base}}\\}} \\beta_g \\cdot \\mathbf{1}\\{g_i = g\\} + \\varepsilon_i\n    $$\n    Here, $\\alpha$ is the intercept, which represents the effect of the baseline gene ($g_{\\text{base}}$), and $\\beta_g$ is the differential effect of gene $g$ relative to this baseline. To construct $\\mathbf{X}$, we first identify the unique set of non-baseline genes, which we order lexicographically. The first column of $\\mathbf{X}$ is a column of ones, corresponding to the intercept $\\alpha$. Subsequent columns are indicator variables (one-hot encoding) for each non-baseline gene. For a given gene $g$, its corresponding column will have a $1$ in row $i$ if gRNA $i$ targets gene $g$, and a $0$ otherwise. This formulation prevents perfect multicollinearity (the \"dummy variable trap\") and makes the model parameters identifiable.\n\n4.  **Solving the WLS System**: With $\\mathbf{y}$, $\\mathbf{W}$, and $\\mathbf{X}$ constructed, the coefficient vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} = [\\hat{\\alpha}, \\hat{\\beta}_{g_1}, \\hat{\\beta}_{g_2}, \\dots]^\\top$ is found by solving the \"normal equations\" for WLS. Instead of explicitly computing the matrix inverse $(\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1}$, which can be numerically unstable, we solve the equivalent and more stable linear system:\n    $$\n    \\left(\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X}\\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} = \\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{y}\n    $$\n    This is a standard linear algebra problem. The solution vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ contains the estimated intercept $\\hat{\\alpha}$ as its first element, followed by the estimated gene effects $\\hat{\\beta}_g$ in the same lexicographical order used to construct $\\mathbf{X}$.\n\n5.  **Output Generation**: The final step is to extract the gene effects $\\hat{\\beta}_g$ from the vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ (i.e., all elements except the first), round them to the specified six decimal places, and format them according to the output requirements for each test case.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to process all test cases and print the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"c0\": [1000, 1200, 900, 1100, 800, 850],\n            \"c1\": [980, 1180, 600, 700, 1200, 1300],\n            \"gene_labels\": [\"NTC\", \"NTC\", \"G1\", \"G1\", \"G2\", \"G2\"],\n            \"baseline_gene\": \"NTC\",\n            \"library_sizes\": (1000000, 1000000),\n            \"s\": 1\n        },\n        {\n            \"c0\": [500, 600, 400, 450],\n            \"c1\": [520, 590, 0, 10],\n            \"gene_labels\": [\"NTC\", \"NTC\", \"G3\", \"G3\"],\n            \"baseline_gene\": \"NTC\",\n            \"library_sizes\": (1000000, 800000),\n            \"s\": 1\n        },\n        {\n            \"c0\": [2000, 2100, 1500],\n            \"c1\": [1990, 2050, 1600],\n            \"gene_labels\": [\"NTC\", \"NTC\", \"G4\"],\n            \"baseline_gene\": \"NTC\",\n            \"library_sizes\": (2000000, 2000000),\n            \"s\": 1\n        }\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        betas = _estimate_gene_effects(**case)\n        all_results.append(betas)\n\n    # Format the final output string as specified.\n    case_strings = []\n    for result_list in all_results:\n        num_strings = [f\"{b:.6f}\" for b in result_list]\n        case_strings.append(f'[{\",\".join(num_strings)}]')\n    \n    final_output = f\"[{','.join(case_strings)}]\"\n    print(final_output)\n\ndef _estimate_gene_effects(c0, c1, gene_labels, baseline_gene, library_sizes, s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs CRISPR screen analysis for a single case.\n    Computes log-fold changes, weights, and fits a WLS model to get gene effects.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Ensure inputs are numpy arrays for vectorized operations\n    c0 = np.array(c0, dtype=float)\n    c1 = np.array(c1, dtype=float)\n    gene_labels = np.array(gene_labels)\n    L0, L1 = library_sizes\n\n    # 1.
