The method stipulated is the Bonferroni correction.\n\nFirst, we define the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER). For a family of $m$ hypothesis tests, the FWER is the probability of making at least one Type I error (a false positive) among all tests. Let $V$ be the random variable representing the number of true null hypotheses that are incorrectly rejected. The FWER is then defined as:\n$$\n\\text{FWER} = P(V \\ge 1)\n$$\n\nLet $H_{0_1}, H_{0_2}, \\dots, H_{0_m}$ be the null hypotheses for the $m$ tests, and let $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_m$ be the corresponding $p$-values. Let $I_0$ be the set of indices for which the null hypothesis is true. A Type I error occurs for test $i \\in I_0$ if we reject $H_{0_i}$. The decision rule is to reject $H_{0_i}$ if its $p$-value $p_i$ is less than or equal to some per-test significance threshold, which we denote as $\\alpha_{BT}$.\n\nThe event $\\{V \\ge 1\\}$ is the union of the events that a true null hypothesis $H_{0_i}$ (where $i \\in I_0$) is rejected. This can be written as:\n$$\n\\text{FWER} = P\\left( \\bigcup_{i \\in I_0} \\{p_i \\le \\alpha_{BT}\\} \\right)\n$$\n\nTo control this probability, we use Boole's inequality, also known as the union bound. This inequality states that for any collection of events, the probability of their union is less than or equal to the sum of their individual probabilities.\n$$\nP\\left( \\bigcup_{i \\in I_0} \\{p_i \\le \\alpha_{BT}\\} \\right) \\le \\sum_{i \\in I_0} P(p_i \\le \\alpha_{BT})\n$$\n\nUnder a true null hypothesis $H_{0_i}$, the $p$-value $p_i$ follows a uniform distribution on the interval $[0, 1]$. The problem states the $p$-values are \"super-uniform\", which means $P(p_i \\le x) \\le x$ for any $x \\in [0, 1]$. This condition is more conservative and strengthens the inequality. For the purpose of finding a general bound, we consider the worst-case scenario allowed, which is the uniform distribution, where $P(p_i \\le \\alpha_{BT}) = \\alpha_{BT}$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in I_0} P(p_i \\le \\alpha_{BT}) \\le \\sum_{i \\in I_0} \\alpha_{BT}\n$$\n\nLet $m_0$ be the number of true null hypotheses, so $m_0 = |I_0|$. The sum becomes $m_0 \\alpha_{BT}$. Combining the inequalities, we have:\n$$\n\\text{FWER} \\le m_0 \\alpha_{BT}\n$$\n\nIn a typical experimental setting, the number of true nulls $m_0$ is unknown. To ensure the FWER is controlled under any condition, we must take the most conservative (largest) possible value for $m_0$, which is the total number of tests, $m$. So, $m_0 \\le m$. This leads to the well-known Bonferroni bound:\n$$\n\\text{FWER} \\le m \\alpha_{BT}\n$$\n\nTo control the FWER at a desired level $\\alpha$, we enforce the condition that this upper bound is equal to $\\alpha$:\n$$\nm \\alpha_{BT} = \\alpha\n$$\nSolving for the per-test threshold $\\alpha_{BT}$ gives the Bonferroni correction formula:\n$$\n\\alpha_{BT} = \\frac{\\alpha}{m}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this formula.\nThe total number of hypothesis tests is $m = 200,000$.\nThe desired FWER level is $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\nThe Bonferroni-corrected per-test $p$-value threshold is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{BT} = \\frac{0.05}{200,000} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-2}}{2 \\times 10^5} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-7}\n$$\n\nThe Manhattan plot displays the results on a $-\\log_{10}$ scale. The horizontal line corresponding to this significance threshold will be at a $y$-value of $-\\log_{10}(\\alpha_{BT})$.\n$$\ny_{\\text{threshold}} = -\\log_{10}(\\alpha_{BT}) = -\\log_{10}(2.5 \\times 10^{-7})\n$$\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, specifically $\\log(ab) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)$ and $\\log(10^k) = k$:\n$$\ny_{\\text{threshold}} = -(\\log_{10}(2.5) + \\log_{10}(10^{-7}))\n$$\n$$\ny_{\\text{threshold}} = -(\\log_{10}(2.5) - 7)\n$$\n$$\ny_{\\text{threshold}} = 7 - \\log_{10}(2.5)\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\log_{10}(2.5) \\approx 0.39794000867...\n$$\n$$\ny_{\\text{threshold}} \\approx 7 - 0.39794000867 = 6.60205999133...\n$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final value to six significant figures.

The study reports a Manhattan plot with numerous sub-genome-wide peaks dispersed across the genome and a Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plot showing early deviation from the null line. The genomic inflation factor (genomic control), $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{GC}}$, computed at the median test statistic, is $1.20$.

The key is to correctly use both the genomic inflation factor ($\\lambda_{\\mathrm{GC}}$) and the Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) intercept.\n\n1.  **Interpreting the Metrics:**\n    *   The genomic inflation factor, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{GC}} = 1.20$, is significantly greater than the null expectation of $1.0$. This indicates systemic inflation of test statistics—the observed $p$-values are smaller across the board than expected by chance.\n    *   This inflation could be due to confounding (like population stratification, cryptic relatedness, or batch effects) or true, widespread polygenic signal (where many variants have real, small effects).\n    *   LD Score Regression is the standard tool to distinguish between these two sources. The LDSC intercept specifically quantifies inflation from confounding. Here, the intercept is $1.02$ (with a standard error of $0.01$), which is very close to the null value of $1.0$. This indicates that confounding bias has been well-controlled and is not the main source of inflation.\n    *   The positive LDSC slope, combined with the near-null intercept, means the observed inflation is almost entirely attributable to the true polygenic architecture of the trait, which is expected for a complex trait like warfarin dosing in a large study ($N=120,000$).\n\n2.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A. Incorrect.** The LDSC intercept of $1.02$ refutes the claim that residual population stratification is the *predominant* cause. Applying classical genomic control by dividing all test statistics by $1.20$ is an outdated and overly harsh correction that would erase true polygenic signal and severely reduce statistical power.\n    *   **B. Correct.** This option correctly concludes that the inflation is due to true polygenicity, based on the near-null LDSC intercept. It recommends the current best practices: do not use the crude $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{GC}}$ for correction, as it conflates signal and bias. Instead, rely on methods like linear mixed models that properly account for genetic structure during the analysis, or at most, apply a minor correction using the LDSC intercept ($1.02$) if working with summary statistics. Reporting all LDSC metrics is also essential for transparency.\n    *   **C. Incorrect.** Cryptic relatedness, a form of confounding, would inflate the LDSC intercept. Since the intercept is near $1.0$, this is not the primary issue. Removing individuals until $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{GC}}=1.0$ would wrongly remove true signal.\n    *   **D. Incorrect.** Uncorrected batch effects would also inflate the LDSC intercept. The proposed correction (\"quantile-normalizing $p$-values\") is not a valid statistical procedure for this context and would destroy the results.\n    *   **E. Incorrect.** This approach fails to use the LDSC results to understand the source of inflation. Simply making the significance threshold more stringent is a crude way to reduce hits but does not fix the inflated test statistics, which should be correctly modeled.\n\nTherefore, the evidence points overwhelmingly to true polygenicity as the source of inflation, making option B the only appropriate interpretation and course of action.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4353250"}]}
