The VAF is used as a proxy for the clonal prevalence and expression potential of the neoantigen source mutation. Consider a bulk tissue sample profiled by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), where the tumor purity is $p$, meaning a fraction $p$ of the cells are tumor and a fraction $1-p$ are normal. Assume the following scientifically realistic conditions: (i) the locus is somatically mutated only in tumor cells (the normal cells carry the reference alleles), (ii) the local tumor copy number is $c_t$ and the number of mutated copies per tumor cell at this locus is $m$, with $0 \\leq m \\leq c_t$, (iii) the normal compartment is diploid at the locus with copy number $c_n=2$, (iv) there is no subclonal heterogeneity within the tumor for this locus, and (v) sequencing reads sample alleles proportionally to their molecular abundance, with no allele-specific biases.\n\nStarting from first principles—namely, the definition of VAF as the fraction of mutant alleles among all alleles sampled in the mixture and the composition of the bulk sample as a mixture of tumor and normal compartments—derive an analytic expression for the expected VAF in terms of $p$, $c_t$, $m$, and $c_n$.

The model described is a standard and fundamental construct in cancer genomics for interpreting sequencing data. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the expected Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) from first principles. The VAF is defined as the fraction of sequencing reads that support the mutant allele. Given the assumption that sequencing reads sample alleles proportionally to their molecular abundance, the VAF is equivalent to the fraction of mutant alleles among the total pool of alleles at a specific locus in the bulk tissue sample.\nLet $VAF$ denote the Variant Allele Fraction.\n$$VAF = \\frac{\\text{Total number of mutant alleles in the sample}}{\\text{Total number of all alleles at the locus in the sample}}$$\n\nThe bulk tissue sample is a mixture of two cell populations: tumor cells and normal cells. Let $p$ be the tumor purity, which is the fraction of cells that are tumor. Consequently, the fraction of cells that are normal is $1-p$. Let's model the number of alleles contributed by each compartment. We can consider a representative sample containing an arbitrary total number of cells, $N$, which will cancel out, so for simplicity, we can reason in terms of the fractional contributions of each cell type.\n\nThe numerator of the $VAF$ expression is the total number of mutant alleles. According to the problem statement, the somatic mutation exists only in tumor cells.\n- The contribution from normal cells to the mutant allele count is $0$.\n- The contribution from tumor cells: A fraction $p$ of the cells are tumor cells, and each tumor cell contains $m$ copies of the mutant allele.\nThe total number of mutant alleles is therefore proportional to the product $p \\times m$.\n\nThe denominator of the $VAF$ expression is the total number of alleles at the locus, including both mutant and reference (wild-type) alleles. This total is the sum of alleles from the normal and tumor compartments.\n- The contribution from normal cells: A fraction $1-p$ of the cells are normal, and each normal cell has a copy number of $c_n$ at this locus. Their contribution to the total allele count is proportional to $(1-p) \\times c_n$.\n- The contribution from tumor cells: A fraction $p$ of the cells are tumor cells, and each tumor cell has a total local copy number of $c_t$. Their contribution to the total allele count is proportional to $p \\times c_t$.\nThe total number of alleles is therefore proportional to the sum of these contributions: $(1-p)c_n + pc_t$.\n\nCombining the numerator and denominator, we derive the general analytic expression for the expected $VAF$:\n$$VAF = \\frac{p \\times m}{(1-p)c_n + pc_t}$$\n\nThe problem requires us to evaluate this expression for the specific case where tumor purity is $p=0.6$, the tumor copy number is $c_t=3$, the number of mutated copies in a tumor cell is $m=1$, and the normal copy number is $c_n=2$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$VAF = \\frac{0.6 \\times 1}{(1-0.6) \\times 2 + 0.6 \\times 3}$$\n\nNow, we perform the arithmetic calculation.\nFirst, evaluate the terms in the denominator:\n$$VAF = \\frac{0.6}{0.4 \\times 2 + 1.8}$$\n$$VAF = \\frac{0.6}{0.8 + 1.8}$$\n$$VAF = \\frac{0.6}{2.6}$$\n\nTo express this as a simplified fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $10$ to remove the decimals:\n$$VAF = \\frac{6}{26}$$\n\nFinally, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $2$:\n$$VAF = \\frac{3}{13}$$\n\nThus, the expected Variant Allele Fraction for the given parameters is $\\frac{3}{13}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{13}}$$", "id": "4363668"}, {"introduction": "For a mutant peptide to be a viable neoantigen, it must bind effectively to a patient's Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules, and ideally, its binding should be stronger than its unmutated 'self' counterpart to evade central tolerance. This practice delves into the biophysical principles of peptide-MHC binding, using the common proxy of $IC_{50}$ values to quantify the change in binding affinity. You will develop a formal index to capture this 'self vs. non-self' difference, which is a cornerstone of immunogenicity prediction.

The half maximal inhibitory concentration ($IC_{50}$) is a widely used proxy for peptide–MHC binding affinity in genomic diagnostics; lower $IC_{50}$ indicates stronger binding. For MHC class I, a commonly used binder threshold is $500$ nanomolar (nM), grounded in extensive benchmarking of peptide–MHC predictions. Central tolerance in the thymus eliminates T cells with high-affinity T Cell Receptor (TCR) recognition of self-peptides presented by MHC; thus, a neoantigen that binds MHC when its wild-type counterpart does not is more likely to escape central tolerance.\n\nStarting from the thermodynamic relation for binding free energy $\\Delta G = -R T \\ln K_{d}$ and the empirical observation that $IC_{50}$ scales proportionally with the dissociation constant $K_{d}$ for a given assay context, derive a dimensionless index $A$ that quantifies the log-fold change in apparent binding affinity between wild-type and mutant peptide presentations.

We can write this relationship as:\n$$\nIC_{50} = c \\cdot K_{d}\n$$\nwhere $c$ is a constant of proportionality specific to the assay conditions. From this, we can express the dissociation constant in terms of $IC_{50}$:\n$$\nK_{d} = \\frac{IC_{50}}{c}\n$$\nThe binding affinity can then be expressed in terms of $IC_{50}$:\n$$\nK_{a} = \\frac{c}{IC_{50}}\n$$\nThis shows that binding affinity is inversely proportional to the $IC_{50}$ value. A lower $IC_{50}$ corresponds to a higher binding affinity.\n\nThe dimensionless index $A$ is defined as the log-fold change in apparent binding affinity between the mutant (${\\text{mut}}$) and wild-type (${\\text{wt}}$) peptides.

\\frac{\\mathrm{TPM} - 10}{110} $$\n\nThe composite score $S$ is given by:\n$$ S \\;=\\; 0.4\\,b \\;+\\; 0.3\\,t \\;+\\; 0.2\\,c \\;+\\; 0.1\\,n $$\nwhere $c$ is the clonality and $n = 1-s$.\n\nNow, we calculate the features and the score $S$ for each of the $12$ peptides.\n\n$P_1$: $(\\mathrm{IC}_{50}=5, \\mathrm{TPM}=120, c=1, s=0.1)$\n$b_1 = \\frac{\\log_{10}(5000/5)}{3} = 1$, $t_1 = \\frac{120-10}{110} = 1$, $c_1=1$, $n_1 = 1-0.1=0.9$.\n$S_1 = 0.4(1) + 0.3(1) + 0.2(1) + 0.1(0.9) = 0.99$.\n\n$P_2$: $(\\mathrm{IC}_{50}=5, \\mathrm{TPM}=110, c=1, s=0.2)$\n$b_2 = 1$, $t_2 = \\frac{110-10}{110} = \\frac{10}{11}$, $c_2=1$, $n_2 = 1-0.2=0.8$.\n$S_2 = 0.4(1) + 0.3(\\frac{10}{11}) + 0.2(1) + 0.1(0.8) = 0.68 + \\frac{3}{11} = \\frac{262}{275} \\approx 0.9527$.\n\n$P_3$: $(\\mathrm{IC}_{50}=5, \\mathrm{TPM}=90, c=0.5, s=0.3)$\n$b_3 = 1$, $t_3 = \\frac{90-10}{110} = \\frac{8}{11}$, $c_3=0.5$, $n_3 = 1-0.3=0.7$.\n$S_3 = 0.4(1) + 0.3(\\frac{8}{11}) + 0.2(0.5) + 0.1(0.7) = 0.57 + \\frac{2.4}{11} = \\frac{867}{1100} \\approx 0.7882$.\n\n$P_4$: $(\\mathrm{IC}_{50}=50, \\mathrm{TPM}=100, c=1, s=0.4)$\n$b_4 = \\frac{\\log_{10}(5000/50)}{3} = \\frac{\\log_{10}(100)}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$, $t_4 = \\frac{100-10}{110} = \\frac{9}{11}$, $c_4=1$, $n_4=1-0.4=0.6$.\n$S_4 = 0.4(\\frac{2}{3}) + 0.3(\\frac{9}{11}) + 0.2(1) + 0.1(0.6) = \\frac{0.8}{3} + \\frac{2.7}{11} + 0.26 = \\frac{637}{825} \\approx 0.7721$.\n\n$P_5$: $(\\mathrm{IC}_{50}=50, \\mathrm{TPM}=80, c=1, s=0.1)$\n$b_5 = \\frac{2}{3}$, $t_5 = \\frac{80-10}{110} = \\frac{7}{11}$, $c_5=1$, $n_5=1-0.1=0.9$.\n$S_5 = 0.4(\\frac{2}{3}) + 0.3(\\frac{7}{11}) + 0.2(1) + 0.1(0.9) = \\frac{0.8}{3} + \\frac{2.1}{11} + 0.29 = \\frac{2467}{3300} \\approx 0.7476$.\n\n$P_6$: $(\\mathrm{IC}_{50}=50, \\mathrm{TPM}=60, c=0.5, s=0.5)$\n$b_6 = \\frac{2}{3}$, $t_6 = \\frac{60-10}{110} = \\frac{5}{11}$, $c_6=0.5$, $n_6=1-0.5=0.5$.\n$S_6 = 0.4(\\frac{2}{3}) + 0.3(\\frac{5}{11}) + 0.2(0.5) + 0.1(0.5) = \\frac{0.8}{3} + \\frac{1.5}{11} + 0.15 = \\frac{73}{132} \\approx 0.5530$.\n\n$P_7$: $(\\mathrm{IC}_{50}=500, \\mathrm{TPM}=70, c=1, s=0.6)$\n$b_7 = \\frac{\\log_{10}(5000/500)}{3} = \\frac{\\log_{10}(10)}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$, $t_7 = \\frac{70-10}{110} = \\frac{6}{11}$, $c_7=1$, $n_7=1-0.6=0.4$.\n$S_7 = 0.4(\\frac{1}{3}) + 0.3(\\frac{6}{11}) + 0.2(1) + 0.1(0.4) = \\frac{0.4}{3} + \\frac{1.8}{11} + 0.24 = \\frac{443}{825} \\approx 0.5370$.\n\n$P_8$: $(\\mathrm{IC}_{50}=500, \\mathrm{TPM}=50, c=0.5, s=0.3)$\n$b_8 = \\frac{1}{3}$, $t_8 = \\frac{50-10}{110} = \\frac{4}{11}$, $c_8=0.5$, $n_8=1-0.3=0.7$.\n$S_8 = 0.4(\\frac{1}{3}) + 0.3(\\frac{4}{11}) + 0.2(0.5) + 0.1(0.7) = \\frac{0.4}{3} + \\frac{1.2}{11} + 0.17 = \\frac{1361}{3300} \\approx 0.4124$.\n\n$P_9$: $(\\mathrm{IC}_{50}=500, \\mathrm{TPM}=30, c=1, s=0.7)$\n$b_9 = \\frac{1}{3}$, $t_9 = \\frac{30-10}{110} = \\frac{2}{11}$, $c_9=1$, $n_9=1-0.7=0.3$.\n$S_9 = 0.4(\\frac{1}{3}) + 0.3(\\frac{2}{11}) + 0.2(1) + 0.1(0.3) = \\frac{0.4}{3} + \\frac{0.6}{11} + 0.23 = \\frac{1379}{3300} \\approx 0.4179$.\n\n$P_{10}$: $(\\mathrm{IC}_{50}=500, \\mathrm{TPM}=10, c=0.5, s=0.4)$\n$b_{10} = \\frac{1}{3}$, $t_{10} = \\frac{10-10}{110} = 0$, $c_{10}=0.5$, $n_{10}=1-0.4=0.6$.\n$S_{10} = 0.4(\\frac{1}{3}) + 0.3(0) + 0.2(0.5) + 0.1(0.6) = \\frac{0.4}{3} + 0.16 = \\frac{22}{75} \\approx 0.2933$.\n\n$P_{11}$: $(\\mathrm{IC}_{50}=5000, \\mathrm{TPM}=20, c=0.5, s=0.8)$\n$b_{11} = \\frac{\\log_{10}(5000/5000)}{3} = \\frac{\\log_{10}(1)}{3} = 0$, $t_{11} = \\frac{20-10}{110} = \\frac{1}{11}$, $c_{11}=0.5$, $n_{11}=1-0.8=0.2$.\n$S_{11} = 0.4(0) + 0.3(\\frac{1}{11}) + 0.2(0.5) + 0.1(0.2) = \\frac{0.3}{11} + 0.12 = \\frac{81}{550} \\approx 0.1473$.\n\n$P_{12}$: $(\\mathrm{IC}_{50}=5000, \\mathrm{TPM}=40, c=0.5, s=0.9)$\n$b_{12} = 0$, $t_{12} = \\frac{40-10}{110} = \\frac{3}{11}$, $c_{12}=0.5$, $n_{12}=1-0.9=0.1$.\n$S_{12} = 0.4(0) + 0.3(\\frac{3}{11}) + 0.2(0.5) + 0.1(0.1) = \\frac{0.9}{11} + 0.11 = \\frac{211}{1100} \\approx 0.1918$.\n\nNext, we rank the peptides by their composite score $S$ in descending order:\n1. $S_1 = 0.99$\n2. $S_2 \\approx 0.9527$\n3. $S_3 \\approx 0.7882$\n4. $S_4 \\approx 0.7721$\n5. $S_5 \\approx 0.7476$\n6. $S_6 \\approx 0.5530$\n7. $S_7 \\approx 0.5370$\n8. $S_9 \\approx 0.4179$\n9. $S_8 \\approx 0.4124$\n10. $S_{10} \\approx 0.2933$\n11. $S_{12} \\approx 0.1918$\n12. $S_{11} \\approx 0.1473$\n\nThe top $10$ peptides are $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5, P_6, P_7, P_9, P_8, P_{10}$.\nWe need to compute the arithmetic mean of their scores. It is more accurate to sum the exact fractional forms of the scores. The sum of all $12$ scores is $\\sum_{i=1}^{12} S_i = \\frac{2041}{300}$ and the sum of the two lowest scores is $S_{11} + S_{12} = \\frac{81}{550} + \\frac{211}{1100} = \\frac{162}{1100} + \\frac{211}{1100} = \\frac{373}{1100}$.\nThe sum of the top $10$ scores is:\n$$ \\sum_{top 10} S = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{12} S_i\\right) - (S_{11} + S_{12}) = \\frac{2041}{300} - \\frac{373}{1100} $$\nThe least common multiple of $300$ and $1100$ is $3300$.\n$$ \\sum_{top 10} S = \\frac{2041 \\cdot 11}{3300} - \\frac{373 \\cdot 3}{3300} = \\frac{22451 - 1119}{3300} = \\frac{21332}{3300} $$\nThe arithmetic mean $\\bar{S}$ is this sum divided by $10$:\n$$ \\bar{S} = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{21332}{3300} = \\frac{21332}{33000} = \\frac{5333}{8250} $$\nNow, we convert this exact fraction to a decimal and round to four significant figures.\n$$ \\bar{S} = \\frac{5333}{8250} \\approx 0.64642424... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.6464$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6464}$$", "id": "4363692"}]}
