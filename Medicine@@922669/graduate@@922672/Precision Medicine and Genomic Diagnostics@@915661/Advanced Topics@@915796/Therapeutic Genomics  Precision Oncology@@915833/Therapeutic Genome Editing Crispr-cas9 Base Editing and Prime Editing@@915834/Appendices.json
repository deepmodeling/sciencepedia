It is a valid problem that can be solved using principles of probability and combinatorics. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the expected number of genomic sites that match a given $20$-mer guide RNA with at most $2$ mismatches. Let $X$ be the random variable representing the total number of such matches in the genome. We are asked to compute the expectation of $X$, denoted as $E[X]$.\n\nThe total number of $20$-mer windows being scanned is given by $N = 2(L - 19)$. Let us define an indicator random variable $I_j$ for each window $j$, where $j$ ranges from $1$ to $N$. The variable $I_j$ is defined as:\n$$\nI_j = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if window } j \\text{ is a match} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe total number of matches is the sum of these indicator variables: $X = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} I_j$.\n\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected total number of matches is the sum of the expected values of the individual indicator variables:\n$$E[X] = E\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{N} I_j\\right] = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} E[I_j]$$\nThe expectation of an indicator variable is the probability of the event it indicates. Thus, $E[I_j] = P(I_j = 1)$. Let $p$ be the probability that a single, randomly selected genomic window is a match. Under the i.i.d. assumption for the genomic bases, this probability $p$ is the same for all windows. Therefore:\n$$E[X] = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} p = Np$$\nOur task reduces to calculating this probability $p$.\n\nA genomic window is a match if its Hamming distance to the $20$-mer guide is at most $2$. This means the number of mismatches, let's call this $M$, can be $0$, $1$, or $2$. The length of the sequence is $k=20$.\n\nFor any single position in the $k$-mer, the guide has a specific base. Since the genomic bases are i.i.d. with a probability of $1/4$ for each of the four bases, the probability of the genomic base matching the guide base is $p_{\\text{match}} = 1/4$. The probability of a mismatch is $p_{\\text{mismatch}} = 1 - p_{\\text{match}} = 3/4$.\n\nThe comparison of the $20$-mer guide to a genomic window can be modeled as a sequence of $k=20$ independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial corresponds to a position and a \"success\" is a mismatch. The total number of mismatches $M$ therefore follows a binomial distribution with parameters $k=20$ and $p_{\\text{mismatch}}=3/4$. The probability mass function is:\n$$P(M=m) = \\binom{k}{m} (p_{\\text{mismatch}})^m (p_{\\text{match}})^{k-m} = \\binom{20}{m} \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^m \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{20-m}$$\nThe probability $p$ of a match is the cumulative probability $P(M \\le 2)$:\n$$p = P(M=0) + P(M=1) + P(M=2)$$\nLet's calculate each term:\n1. Probability of $0$ mismatches (perfect match):\n$$P(M=0) = \\binom{20}{0} \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^0 \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{20} = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4^{20}} = \\frac{1}{4^{20}}$$\n2. Probability of exactly $1$ mismatch:\n$$P(M=1) = \\binom{20}{1} \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^1 \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{19} = 20 \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4^{19}} = \\frac{20 \\cdot 3}{4^{20}} = \\frac{60}{4^{20}}$$\n3. Probability of exactly $2$ mismatches:\n$$P(M=2) = \\binom{20}{2} \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{18} = \\frac{20 \\cdot 19}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3^2}{4^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4^{18}} = 190 \\cdot \\frac{9}{4^{20}} = \\frac{1710}{4^{20}}$$\nSumming these probabilities gives $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{1}{4^{20}} + \\frac{60}{4^{20}} + \\frac{1710}{4^{20}} = \\frac{1 + 60 + 1710}{4^{20}} = \\frac{1771}{4^{20}}$$\nNow we can calculate the expected number of matches, $E[X] = Np$:\n$$E[X] = 2(L - 19) \\cdot p = 2(L - 19) \\frac{1771}{4^{20}}$$\nSubstituting the given value for $L = 3.1 \\times 10^9$:\n$$E[X] = 2(3.1 \\times 10^9 - 19) \\frac{1771}{4^{20}}$$\nWe perform the numerical evaluation:\nThe number of windows is $N = 2(3,100,000,000 - 19) = 2(3,099,999,981) = 6,199,999,962$.\nThe denominator is $4^{20} = (2^2)^{20} = 2^{40} = (2^{10})^4 = 1024^4 = 1,099,511,627,776$.\nSo, the expected number of matches is:\n$$E[X] = 6,199,999,962 \\times \\frac{1771}{1,099,511,627,776}$$\n$$E[X] = \\frac{11,000,199,932,302}{1,099,511,627,776} \\approx 9.9864331$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$E[X] \\approx 9.986$$\nThis result represents the expected number of off-target sites in the human genome for a given guide RNA, under the specified idealized model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.986}$$", "id": "4391949"}, {"introduction": "Effective therapeutic editing requires not only that the editor finds its target, but that it performs the correct chemical modification without collateral damage.

Codon $1$ (positions $5$–$7$) must encode Leucine ($\\text{Leu}$).\n2. Codon $2$ (positions $8$–$10$) must not encode a stop codon.\n\nLet's analyze these two conditions separately.\n\n**Condition 1: Codon 1 Outcome**\nThe initial sequence for codon $1$ is $\\text{C}_5\\text{C}_6\\text{A}_7$. Edits can occur at positions $5$ and $6$. We analyze the four possible outcomes for this codon based on the edit events $E_5$ and $E_6$:\n- **No edits ($\\neg E_5 \\cap \\neg E_6$):** The codon remains $\\text{C}\\,\\text{C}\\,\\text{A}$, which encodes Proline.

This satisfies the condition.\n- **Edits at both positions 5 and 6 ($E_5 \\cap E_6$):** The codon becomes $\\text{T}\\,\\text{T}\\,\\text{A}$, which also encodes Leucine. This satisfies the condition.\n\nFor Codon $1$ to encode Leucine, an edit must occur at position $6$, regardless of whether an edit occurs at position $5$. Therefore, the event \"Codon $1$ encodes Leucine\" is equivalent to the event $E_6$.\nThe probability of this condition being met is $P(\\text{Codon 1 is Leu}) = P(E_6) = p_6$.\n\n**Condition 2: Codon 2 Outcome**\nThe initial sequence for codon $2$ is $\\text{C}_8\\text{A}_9\\text{G}_{10}$. An edit can occur at position $8$. We analyze the two possible outcomes for this codon based on the edit event $E_8$:\n- **No edit ($\\neg E_8$):** The codon remains $\\text{C}\\,\\text{A}\\,\\text{G}$, which encodes Glutamine. This is not a stop codon and satisfies the condition.\n- **Edit at position 8 ($E_8$):** The codon becomes $\\text{T}\\,\\text{A}\\,\\text{G}$, which is a stop codon. This does not satisfy the condition.\n\nFor Codon $2$ to not be a stop codon, no edit must occur at position $8$. Therefore, the event \"Codon $2$ is not a Stop Codon\" is equivalent to the event $\\neg E_8$.\nThe probability of this condition being met is $P(\\text{Codon 2 is not Stop}) = P(\\neg E_8) = 1 - p_8$.\n\n**Total Probability of a Functional Outcome**\nA functional outcome requires both conditions to be met simultaneously. Let $F$ be the event of a functional outcome.\n$F = (\\text{Codon 1 is Leu}) \\cap (\\text{Codon 2 is not Stop})$\nIn terms of the editing events, this is:\n$F = E_6 \\cap \\neg E_8$\n\nSince the editing events at different positions ($E_5$, $E_6$, $E_8$) are defined as independent, the events $E_6$ and $\\neg E_8$ are also independent. The probability of the intersection of independent events is the product of their individual probabilities.\n$P(F) = P(E_6) \\times P(\\neg E_8)$\n$P(F) = p_6 (1 - p_8)$\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$p_6 = 0.70$\n$p_8 = 0.10$\n\n$P(F) = 0.70 \\times (1 - 0.10)$\n$P(F) = 0.70 \\times 0.90$\n$P(F) = 0.63$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$P(F) = 0.6300$\nThis value represents the expected fraction of cells in the population that will have a functionally corrected protein, according to the specified criteria.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6300}\n$$", "id": "4391927"}, {"introduction": "Prime editing represents a significant advance, enabling precise insertions, deletions, and all 12 types of point mutations without requiring double-strand breaks.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe solution is structured to address the three tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\n**Task 1: pegRNA Design to Maximize $E_{\\mathrm{PE}}$**\n\nThe overall Prime Editing efficiency is given by the product:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{PE}} = m_{\\mathrm{nick}} P_{\\mathrm{bind}} P_{\\mathrm{init}} P_{\\mathrm{ext}} P_{\\mathrm{flap}}$$\nTo maximize $E_{\\mathrm{PE}}$, we must select the design parameters $L_{\\mathrm{PBS}}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{RT}}$ to maximize the terms that depend on them, subject to the given constraints.\n\nThe factors $m_{\\mathrm{nick}}$, $P_{\\mathrm{bind}}$, and $P_{\\mathrm{flap}}$ are independent of $L_{\\mathrm{PBS}}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{RT}}$. Their values are fixed by the provided parameters:\n- $m_{\\mathrm{nick}} = 1.30$ (constant).\n- $P_{\\mathrm{bind}}$ depends only on $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$, $C$, and $t$, which are fixed.\n- $P_{\\mathrm{flap}}$ depends only on $d$, $d_0$, and $\\alpha$, which are fixed.\n\nThus, maximizing $E_{\\mathrm{PE}}$ is equivalent to maximizing the product $P_{\\mathrm{init}} \\times P_{\\mathrm{ext}}$. Since $P_{\\mathrm{init}}$ depends only on $L_{\\mathrm{PBS}}$ and $P_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ depends only on $L_{\\mathrm{RT}}$, we can optimize them independently.\n\n**Optimization of $L_{\\mathrm{PBS}}$:**\nWe need to maximize $P_{\\mathrm{init}} = p_{\\mathrm{max}} \\exp(-\\beta (L_{\\mathrm{PBS}} - L_{\\mathrm{opt}})^{2})$ subject to the constraint $8 \\leq L_{\\mathrm{PBS}} \\leq 15$.\nThe function is a Gaussian centered at $L_{\\mathrm{opt}}$. Since $p_{\\mathrm{max}}$ and $\\beta$ are positive constants, $P_{\\mathrm{init}}$ is maximized when the term $(L_{\\mathrm{PBS}} - L_{\\mathrm{opt}})^{2}$ is minimized, which occurs when $L_{\\mathrm{PBS}}$ is as close as possible to $L_{\\mathrm{opt}}$.\nGiven $L_{\\mathrm{opt}} = 12$ nt, and the allowed range for $L_{\\mathrm{PBS}}$ is $[8, 15]$, the optimal value is $L_{\\mathrm{PBS}} = 12$ nt, as it falls within the allowed range.\nTherefore, the optimal PBS length is $L_{\\mathrm{PBS}} = 12$ nt.\n\n**Optimization of $L_{\\mathrm{RT}}$:**\nWe need to maximize $P_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\exp(-\\gamma L_{\\mathrm{RT}})$ subject to the constraint on $L_{\\mathrm{RT}}$.\nThe constraint is that the RT template must encode the $4$-nt insertion plus at least $10$ nt of downstream homology. The total length required is the sum of the lengths of the edit and the homology region.\n$L_{\\mathrm{RT}} \\ge (\\text{insertion length}) + (\\text{homology length}) = 4 \\ \\mathrm{nt} + 10 \\ \\mathrm{nt} = 14 \\ \\mathrm{nt}$.\nSo, the constraint is $L_{\\mathrm{RT}} \\ge 14$.\nThe function to maximize is $P_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\exp(-\\gamma L_{\\mathrm{RT}})$. Since $\\gamma = 0.050 \\ \\mathrm{nt}^{-1}$ is positive, the function $\\exp(-\\gamma x)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $x$. To maximize $P_{\\mathrm{ext}}$, we must choose the smallest possible value for $L_{\\mathrm{RT}}$.\nThe minimum allowed value is $L_{\\mathrm{RT}} = 14$ nt.\nTherefore, the optimal RT template length is $L_{\\mathrm{RT}} = 14$ nt.\n\nThe optimal pegRNA design parameters are $L_{\\mathrm{PBS}} = 12$ nt and $L_{\\mathrm{RT}} = 14$ nt.\n\n**Task 2: Computation of $E_{\\mathrm{PE}}$**\n\nUsing the optimal design parameters and the given constants, we compute each term in the efficiency formula.\n\n1.  **$P_{\\mathrm{bind}}$**:\n    The argument of the exponent is $k_{\\mathrm{on}} C t = (1.5 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\mathrm{M}) \\times (120 \\ \\mathrm{s}) = 5.4$.\n    $P_{\\mathrm{bind}} = 1 - \\exp(-5.4)$.\n\n2.  **$P_{\\mathrm{init}}$**:\n    With the optimal $L_{\\mathrm{PBS}} = 12$ nt and $L_{\\mathrm{opt}} = 12$ nt:\n    $P_{\\mathrm{init}} = p_{\\mathrm{max}} \\exp(-\\beta (12 - 12)^{2}) = p_{\\mathrm{max}} \\exp(0) = p_{\\mathrm{max}} = 0.80$.\n\n3.  **$P_{\\mathrm{ext}}$**:\n    With the optimal $L_{\\mathrm{RT}} = 14$ nt and $\\gamma = 0.050 \\ \\mathrm{nt}^{-1}$:\n    The argument of the exponent is $\\gamma L_{\\mathrm{RT}} = 0.050 \\times 14 = 0.7$.\n    $P_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\exp(-0.7)$.\n\n4.  **$P_{\\mathrm{flap}}$**:\n    With $d=2$ nt, $d_0=3$ nt, and $\\alpha=0.50 \\ \\mathrm{nt}^{-1}$:\n    The argument of the exponent is $\\alpha(d - d_0) = 0.50 \\times (2 - 3) = -0.5$.\n    $P_{\\mathrm{flap}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5)}$.\n\nNow, we assemble the full expression for $E_{\\mathrm{PE}}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{PE}} = m_{\\mathrm{nick}} \\times P_{\\mathrm{bind}} \\times P_{\\mathrm{init}} \\times P_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\times P_{\\mathrm{flap}}$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{PE}} = 1.30 \\times (1 - \\exp(-5.4)) \\times 0.80 \\times \\exp(-0.7) \\times \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.5)}$$\nWe compute the numerical value:\n$\\exp(-5.4) \\approx 0.00451658$\n$\\exp(-0.7) \\approx 0.49658530$\n$\\exp(-0.5) \\approx 0.60653066$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{bind}} \\approx 1 - 0.00451658 = 0.99548342$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{init}} = 0.80$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\approx 0.49658530$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{flap}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 0.60653066} = \\frac{1}{1.60653066} \\approx 0.62245933$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{PE}} \\approx 1.30 \\times 0.99548342 \\times 0.80 \\times 0.49658530 \\times 0.62245933$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{PE}} \\approx 0.3200025$$\n\n**Task 3: Computation of the Ratio $R$**\n\nThe ratio $R$ is defined as the efficiency of Prime Editing relative to Base Editing at the same locus.\n$$R = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{PE}}}{E_{\\mathrm{BE}}}$$\nUsing the calculated value of $E_{\\mathrm{PE}}$ and the given value $E_{\\mathrm{BE}} = 0.28$:\n$$R = \\frac{0.3200025}{0.28} \\approx 1.142866$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final ratio to four significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 1.143$$\nThis result indicates that, under the modeled conditions and with an optimized pegRNA design, Prime Editing is predicted to be approximately $14.3\\%$ more efficient than the corresponding Base Editor for modifying this specific genomic locus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.143}$$", "id": "4391913"}]}
