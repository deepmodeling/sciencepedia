A solution will be generated.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of the total length of a gene expression cassette, which is constructed by concatenating several non-overlapping DNA segments. The governing principle, as stated in the problem, is that the total length is the arithmetic sum of the lengths of the individual segments.\n\nLet $L_{total}$ represent the total size of the expression cassette in kilobases (kb). Let the lengths of the constituent modules be denoted as follows:\n- $L_{promoter}$: Length of the promoter\n- $L_{intron}$: Length of the intron\n- $L_{coding}$: Length of the protein-coding sequence\n- $L_{WPRE}$: Length of the WPRE\n- $L_{polyA}$: Length of the polyadenylation signal\n\nAccording to the provided principle for non-overlapping, concatenated segments, the total length is given by the sum:\n$$\nL_{total} = L_{promoter} + L_{intron} + L_{coding} + L_{WPRE} + L_{polyA}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- $L_{promoter} = 0.8 \\, \\mathrm{kb}$\n- $L_{intron} = 0.4 \\, \\mathrm{kb}$\n- $L_{coding} = 1.8 \\, \\mathrm{kb}$\n- $L_{WPRE} = 0.6 \\, \\mathrm{kb}$\n- $L_{polyA} = 0.2 \\, \\mathrm{kb}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$\nL_{total} = 0.8 + 0.4 + 1.8 + 0.6 + 0.2\n$$\n\nThe sum is calculated as follows:\n$$\nL_{total} = (0.8 + 0.4) + 1.8 + (0.6 + 0.2)\n$$\n$$\nL_{total} = 1.2 + 1.8 + 0.8\n$$\n$$\nL_{total} = 3.0 + 0.8\n$$\n$$\nL_{total} = 3.8\n$$\n\nThe total size of the expression cassette is $3.8 \\, \\mathrm{kb}$. This value is exact, as required. This calculation is a critical step in AAV vector design, as the total length of the DNA packaged between the ITRs must not exceed the virus's packaging capacity, which is approximately $4.7 \\, \\mathrm{kb}$.

A solution will be constructed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThis problem involves two independent calculations based on the principles of fluid dynamics in a porous medium and conservation of mass.\n\n**Part 1: Geometric Volume of Distribution ($V_d$)**\n\nFirst, we establish the total volume of fluid infused from the delivery system over the duration $T$. This volume, which we can call $V_{\\text{pumped}}$, is the product of the constant infusion rate $Q$ and the duration $T$.\n$$V_{\\text{pumped}} = Q T$$\n\nHowever, a fraction $b$ of this volume is lost to backflow along the cannula track and does not enter the target tissue parenchyma. The volume of fluid that effectively enters the tissue, $V_{\\text{fluid}}$, is therefore:\n$$V_{\\text{fluid}} = (1-b) V_{\\text{pumped}} = (1-b) Q T$$\n\nThe problem defines porosity, $\\phi$, as the ratio of the fluid-accessible volume to the total geometric volume. In this context, the fluid that has entered the tissue, $V_{\\text{fluid}}$, occupies the accessible pore space of a larger geometric volume, which is the volume of distribution, $V_d$.\n$$\\phi = \\frac{\\text{Fluid-accessible Volume}}{\\text{Geometric Volume}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{fluid}}}{V_d}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the geometric volume of distribution $V_d$.

Let $V_{\\text{infused}}$ be the total volume that needs to be pumped to achieve the delivery of $V_{\\text{fluid, target}}$ into the tissue. The relationship between these volumes is:\n$$V_{\\text{fluid, target}} = (1-b)V_{\\text{infused}}$$\n\nSolving for the total volume that must be infused:\n$$V_{\\text{infused}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{fluid, target}}}{1-b} = \\frac{\\phi V_{\\text{target}}}{1-b}$$\n\nThe total number of viral genomes required, $N_{\\text{req}}$, is this total infused volume multiplied by the concentration of the vector stock, $c$.\n$$N_{\\text{req}} = c \\times V_{\\text{infused}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{\\text{infused}}$, we get the final symbolic expression for $N_{\\text{req}}$:\n$$N_{\\text{req}} = \\frac{c \\phi V_{\\text{target}}}{1-b}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value.
