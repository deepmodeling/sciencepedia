The givens are: a total number of sequencing reads $N_{\\text{total}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{7}$, a number of reads uniquely mapping to the mouse genome $N_{\\text{mouse}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{6}$, the definition of mouse contamination fraction $f_{c} = \\frac{N_{\\text{mouse}}}{N_{\\text{total}}}$, a minimum required number of mutant-supporting reads $r_{\\min}$, and a minimum observed variant allele fraction (VAF) threshold $v_{\\min}$. The problem asks for a calculation of $f_{c}$ and a symbolic derivation for the minimal true VAF, $v_{\\text{true,min}}$, under simplifying assumptions. These concepts and parameters are standard in the bioinformatic analysis of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) sequencing data. The problem is well-defined, internally consistent, scientifically valid, and requires a solution based on established statistical principles (the binomial model). Therefore, proceeding with a solution is appropriate.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of the mouse contamination fraction, $f_{c}$.\nThe mouse contamination fraction is defined as the ratio of the number of reads uniquely mapping to the mouse genome, $N_{\\text{mouse}}$, to the total number of reads, $N_{\\text{total}}$.\n$$f_{c} = \\frac{N_{\\text{mouse}}}{N_{\\text{total}}}$$\nSubstituting the provided values:\n$$f_{c} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{6}}{1.0 \\times 10^{7}} = \\frac{2.0}{10.0} = 0.2$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the result is $0.2000$.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the minimal true VAF, $v_{\\text{true,min}}$.\nThe sensitivity of variant calling is affected by mouse contamination because contaminant reads reduce the effective sequencing depth available for the human tumor genome. First, we define the total number of reads that are available for alignment to the human genome. Given that the mouse-unique reads are excluded, the number of reads used for human variant calling, which we denote as the effective total depth $D$, is the total number of reads minus the mouse-contaminant reads.\n$$D = N_{\\text{total}} - N_{\\text{mouse}}$$\nUsing the definition of $f_{c}$, we can express $N_{\\text{mouse}}$ as $f_{c} N_{\\text{total}}$. Substituting this into the expression for $D$:\n$$D = N_{\\text{total}} - f_{c} N_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{total}}(1 - f_{c})$$\nThis equation shows that the effective depth of coverage $D$ for the human component is reduced by a factor of $(1 - f_{c})$ due to contamination.\n\nNext, we model the process of observing variant reads. The *true* variant allele fraction, $v_{\\text{true}}$, is the actual proportion of the variant allele in the tumor's DNA. Assuming no copy number alterations and diploid genetics, this represents the probability that a sequencing read sampled from a specific locus will support the variant allele. The number of reads, $r$, that support the variant out of a total depth $D$ at that locus is a random variable that can be modeled by a binomial distribution:\n$$r \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n=D, p=v_{\\text{true}})$$\nThe expected number of variant-supporting reads is given by $E[r] = n \\cdot p = D \\cdot v_{\\text{true}}$.\n\nA variant caller requires two conditions to be met to call a variant:\n1. The number of variant-supporting reads, $r$, must be at least $r_{\\min}$: $r \\ge r_{\\min}$.\n2. The observed VAF, $v_{\\text{obs}}$, which is calculated as $v_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{r}{D}$, must be at least $v_{\\min}$: $\\frac{r}{D} \\ge v_{\\min}$. This is equivalent to $r \\ge D \\cdot v_{\\min}$.\n\nFor a variant to be called, both conditions must be satisfied simultaneously. This means the number of supporting reads $r$ must meet the more stringent of the two requirements:\n$$r \\ge \\max(r_{\\min}, D \\cdot v_{\\min})$$\nTo determine the theoretical limit of sensitivity, we find the minimal true VAF, $v_{\\text{true,min}}$, such that the *expected* number of variant reads is equal to this required minimum. This establishes the threshold at which a variant becomes statistically likely to be detected.\n$$E[r] = D \\cdot v_{\\text{true,min}} = \\max(r_{\\min}, D \\cdot v_{\\min})$$\nSolving for $v_{\\text{true,min}}$ yields:\n$$v_{\\text{true,min}} = \\frac{\\max(r_{\\min}, D \\cdot v_{\\min})}{D}$$\nThis expression can be simplified by distributing the division across the $\\max$ function:\n$$v_{\\text{true,min}} = \\max\\left(\\frac{r_{\\min}}{D}, \\frac{D \\cdot v_{\\min}}{D}\\right) = \\max\\left(\\frac{r_{\\min}}{D}, v_{\\min}\\right)$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for the effective depth $D = N_{\\text{total}}(1 - f_{c})$ into this equation to obtain the final symbolic expression for the minimal true VAF as a function of the given parameters:\n$$v_{\\text{true,min}} = \\max\\left(\\frac{r_{\\min}}{N_{\\text{total}}(1 - f_c)}, v_{\\min}\\right)$$\nThis derived expression explains how mouse contamination $f_c$ affects sensitivity. As $f_c$ increases, the denominator of the first term, $N_{\\text{total}}(1 - f_c)$, decreases. This causes the term $\\frac{r_{\\min}}{N_{\\text{total}}(1 - f_c)}$ to increase. Consequently, the value of $v_{\\text{true,min}}$, which is the maximum of this term and $v_{\\min}$, will either increase or remain unchanged (if $v_{\\min}$ is the dominant term). An increase in $v_{\\text{true,min}}$ means that a higher fraction of variant alleles must be present in the tumor for it to be detected, which signifies a decrease in analytical sensitivity, especially for detecting low-frequency somatic mutations.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0.2000 & \\max\\left(\\frac{r_{\\min}}{N_{\\text{total}}(1 - f_c)}, v_{\\min}\\right) \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4366590"}, {"introduction": "Once sequencing data is filtered for human reads, interpreting the variant allele fraction (VAF) requires accounting for sample complexity, including tumor purity and local copy number. A raw VAF value is not directly equivalent to the fraction of cancer cells carrying a mutation.

You restrict analysis to human-aligned reads. From prior copy number profiling, the tumor segment has total tumor copy number $C_{t}=3$. The sample contains a mixture of tumor and normal cells: the tumor purity is $p=0.6$, and the normal compartment is assumed to be diploid with $C_{n}=2$. A single-nucleotide variant (SNV) is observed in this segment with variant allele fraction (VAF) $VAF=0.2$.

Use this to compute the corrected cancer cell fraction for the observed data. Express your final numerical answer as a single fraction in lowest terms.

The terminology and parameters ($p$, $C_t$, $C_n$, $VAF$, $m$, $f$) are standard in the field. The provided values are realistic. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and asks for a derivation and calculation that lead to a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe derivation begins by defining the expected variant allele fraction ($VAF$) as the ratio of the number of variant (mutated) alleles to the total number of alleles at the genomic locus of interest. The sample is a mixture of tumor and normal cells.\n\nLet's consider the composition of alleles in a representative population of cells from the sample. The total number of alleles at the locus is the sum of alleles from the normal cell component and the tumor cell component.\nThe fraction of normal cells in the sample is $(1-p)$. Each normal cell is diploid, having $C_n=2$ copies of the chromosome at this locus. The contribution of normal cells to the total allele count is proportional to $(1-p)C_n$.\nThe fraction of tumor cells is $p$. Each tumor cell has a total copy number of $C_t$ at this locus. The contribution of tumor cells to the total allele count is proportional to $p C_t$.\nThe total number of alleles in the mixture (the denominator of the $VAF$ equation) is therefore proportional to the weighted average of the copy numbers:\n$$\n\\text{Total Alleles} \\propto p C_t + (1-p) C_n\n$$\nNext, we consider the number of variant alleles (the numerator). The single-nucleotide variant (SNV) is a somatic mutation, assumed to be absent in the normal cells. The mutation is present only in a fraction $f$ of the tumor cells. The fraction of all cells in the sample that are mutated tumor cells is thus $p \\times f$.\nWithin each of these mutated tumor cells, the variant allele is present with a multiplicity of $m$. This means there are $m$ copies of the variant allele per mutated tumor cell.\nThe number of variant alleles is therefore proportional to the fraction of mutated tumor cells multiplied by the multiplicity of the variant allele in those cells:\n$$\n\\text{Variant Alleles} \\propto p \\cdot f \\cdot m\n$$\nThe expected variant allele fraction, $VAF$, is the ratio of the variant allele count to the total allele count:\n$$\nVAF = \\frac{p \\cdot f \\cdot m}{p \\cdot C_t + (1-p) \\cdot C_n}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the expected $VAF$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to solve for the corrected cancer cell fraction, $f$. We rearrange the expression algebraically:\n$$\nVAF \\cdot \\left( p \\cdot C_t + (1-p) \\cdot C_n \\right) = p \\cdot f \\cdot m\n$$\nIsolating $f$ gives:\n$$\nf = \\frac{VAF \\cdot \\left( p \\cdot C_t + (1-p) \\cdot C_n \\right)}{p \\cdot m}\n$$\nThis is the general formula for $f$. Now, we substitute the given values into this equation.\nGiven: $VAF = 0.2 = \\frac{1}{5}$, $p = 0.6 = \\frac{3}{5}$, $C_t = 3$, $C_n = 2$, and $m = 1$.\nThe fraction of normal cells is $1-p = 1 - \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\cdot 3 + \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot 2 \\right)}{\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot 1}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the term in the parenthesis:\n$$\n\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot 3 + \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot 2 = \\frac{9}{5} + \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{13}{5}\n$$\nNow we substitute this back into the expression for $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{\\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{13}{5}}{\\frac{3}{5}} = \\frac{\\frac{13}{25}}{\\frac{3}{5}}\n$$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator:\n$$\nf = \\frac{13}{25} \\cdot \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{13 \\cdot 5}{25 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{13}{5 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{13}{15}\n$$\nThe corrected cancer cell fraction is $f = \\frac{13}{15}$. This fraction is in its lowest terms as $13$ is a prime number and not a factor of $15$.\n\nThe final part of the task is to interpret this result. A mutation is considered **clonal** if it is present in all cancer cells, which corresponds to $f=1$. A mutation is considered **subclonal** if it is present in only a fraction of the cancer cells, meaning $f < 1$.\nOur calculated cancer cell fraction is $f = \\frac{13}{15}$. Since $\\frac{13}{15} < 1$, the mutation is not present in the entire tumor cell population. Specifically, it is present in approximately $86.7\\%$ of the tumor cells. By definition, an event that is not ubiquitous throughout the tumor population is a subclonal event. While the fraction is high, indicating that the mutation is present in a majority of the tumor cells (i.e., it defines a major subclone), it is still technically subclonal. Thus, the mutation is more consistent with a subclonal event.\n\nThe reasoning is direct: The cancer cell fraction $f$ represents the proportion of tumor cells carrying the mutation. A clonal mutation implies $f=1$. The calculated value $f=\\frac{13}{15}$ is strictly less than $1$. Therefore, the data are consistent with the mutation being subclonal.\nWe can cross-validate this by calculating the VAF expected for a truly clonal event ($f=1$) given the other parameters:\n$$\nVAF_{clonal} = \\frac{p \\cdot 1 \\cdot m}{p C_t + (1-p) C_n} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1}{\\frac{3}{5} \\cdot 3 + \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot 2} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{5}}{\\frac{9}{5} + \\frac{4}{5}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{5}}{\\frac{13}{5}} = \\frac{3}{13}\n$$\nThe expected VAF for a clonal mutation is $\\frac{3}{13} \\approx 0.231$. The observed VAF is $0.2$, which is lower than the expected clonal VAF. This confirms that the mutation's prevalence in the cancer cell population must be less than $100\\%$, reinforcing the conclusion that it is subclonal.\nThe proportion of the clonal VAF that is observed gives the CCF: $f = \\frac{VAF_{observed}}{VAF_{clonal}} = \\frac{0.2}{3/13} = \\frac{1/5}{3/13} = \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{13}{3} = \\frac{13}{15}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{13}{15}}\n$$", "id": "4366574"}, {"introduction": "A key objective of preclinical research is to translate effective therapies from animal models to the clinic.

The given values for the mass-to-surface-area conversion factors ($K_m$) are standard in the field.\n\nThe central task is to translate a mouse dose to a Human Equivalent Dose (HED) using body surface area (BSA) scaling. The fundamental principle of this method is that equivalent systemic exposure between species is achieved when the dose administered per unit of body surface area is the same.\n\nLet $D_{\\text{animal}}$ be the dose in units of mass per unit body weight (e.g., mg/kg) for an animal species, and let HED be the corresponding human equivalent dose, also in mg/kg. The conversion from a dose in mg/kg to a dose in mass per unit body surface area (e.g., mg/m$^2$) is accomplished using the species-specific $K_m$ factor.

Rather, it serves as the Maximum Recommended Starting Dose (MRSD) for a Phase 1 clinical trial, as per regulatory guidelines (e.g., from the U.S. FDA). It establishes a data-driven upper limit for the initial dose to ensure patient safety.\n\n2.  **Application of Safety Factors:** Standard practice involves applying a safety factor to the calculated HED to determine the actual starting dose in the trial. A typical safety factor is $10$, especially for novel therapeutic agents or those with steep dose-toxicity curves. Applying a factor of $10$ would suggest a starting dose of approximately $0.4054$ mg/kg. The choice of the safety factor is based on the novelty of the drug's mechanism, the preclinical toxicology profile, and the patient population (e.g., cancer patients versus healthy volunteers).\n\n3.  **Pharmacokinetic (PK) and Pharmacodynamic (PD) Variability:** BSA scaling is an empirical approximation that does not account for all interspecies differences.\n    - **PK Variability:** Differences in drug Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) between mice and humans can lead to different systemic exposures even at the HED. For instance, the expression and activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes (like cytochrome P450s) can vary significantly, potentially leading to much faster or slower clearance of the drug in humans compared to mice.\n    - **Protein Binding:** The fraction of drug bound to plasma proteins can differ between species. Only the unbound (free) drug is typically pharmacologically active. If plasma protein binding is higher in humans than in mice, the free drug concentration at the HED could be lower than predicted, affecting both efficacy and toxicity.\n    - **PD Variability:** The PDO-to-PDX model is a powerful tool, but the tumor microenvironment in a mouse host is not identical to that in a human patient. Furthermore, there might be subtle differences in the drug target or downstream signaling pathways between species.\n\n4.  **Translational Context (PDO-PDX-Human):** The use of PDOs and PDXs provides strong preclinical rationale for the drug's activity against a tumor with a specific genetic background. This strengthens confidence in the mechanism of action. The HED calculation is the next logical step, providing a bridge from the effective dose in a relevant *in vivo* model (the PDX) to a safe starting point for human trials. The clinical trial will then proceed with dose-escalation cohorts to determine the actual human safety, tolerability, PK profile, and ultimately the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.054}$$", "id": "4366599"}]}
