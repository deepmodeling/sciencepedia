## Introduction
In the pursuit of precision oncology, a critical challenge has been the development of preclinical models that accurately predict a patient's response to therapy. Traditional models, such as immortalized cancer cell lines, often fail to capture the complex genetic and [phenotypic heterogeneity](@entry_id:261639) of human tumors, contributing to the high failure rate of new drugs in clinical trials. Patient-derived [organoids](@entry_id:153002) (PDOs) and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) have emerged as powerful alternatives, offering a higher-fidelity platform for translational research by better preserving the characteristics of the original tumor. However, these models are not interchangeable and possess distinct biological properties, strengths, and limitations that must be carefully understood.

This article provides a graduate-level guide to the principles and applications of these advanced preclinical models. By navigating the complexities of their creation, validation, and use, researchers can more effectively bridge the gap between laboratory discovery and clinical impact. The first chapter, **"Principles and Mechanisms,"** delves into the fundamental biology of PDOs and PDXs, defining their key characteristics, outlining methods for their establishment and maintenance, and examining the critical concept of model fidelity. The second chapter, **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections,"** explores how these models are practically applied in drug development, [immuno-oncology](@entry_id:190846), and metastasis research, highlighting their integration with computational and systems biology. Finally, the **"Hands-On Practices"** section provides interactive exercises that cover essential bioinformatics and translational calculations, allowing you to apply these concepts to real-world research scenarios.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### Fundamental Distinctions Among Patient-Derived Models

Preclinical cancer research relies on models that faithfully recapitulate the biology of a patient's tumor. Among the most advanced are patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Understanding their fundamental principles, including their composition and the environments in which they are propagated, is critical for their proper use and the interpretation of experimental results.

#### Defining the Patient-Derived Organoid

A **patient-derived [organoid](@entry_id:163459) (PDO)** is more than a simple three-dimensional cluster of cells. To qualify as a bona fide [organoid](@entry_id:163459), a culture must satisfy a set of stringent criteria that reflect the architecture and function of the originating tissue. These criteria distinguish organoids from less complex models like two-dimensional monolayers or simple non-adherent spheroids. The three minimal properties of an epithelial organoid are **[epithelial polarity](@entry_id:176648)**, a **lineage hierarchy**, and **niche dependency** [@problem_id:4366578].

First, **[epithelial polarity](@entry_id:176648)** refers to the establishment of a distinct apical-basal axis. This is not a random arrangement of cells but a highly organized structure, typically forming a hollow sphere or a complex budding architecture with a central lumen. This organization is achieved through anisotropic adhesion: the basal surface of the epithelial cells engages with an extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold via integrin receptors, while the apical surface, facing the lumen, is sealed by [tight junctions](@entry_id:143539) (e.g., those containing Zonula Occludens-1, or ZO-1). This recapitulates the fundamental barrier function of [epithelial tissues](@entry_id:261324).

Second, a **lineage hierarchy** implies that the [organoid](@entry_id:163459) is not a static, monotypic collection of cells. It must contain a population of self-renewing stem or progenitor cells. These cells are responsible for the long-term maintenance of the [organoid](@entry_id:163459) and, upon receiving appropriate signals, can differentiate into two or more mature epithelial lineages characteristic of the tissue of origin. For example, a [colorectal cancer](@entry_id:264919) [organoid](@entry_id:163459) should contain not only stem cells but also be capable of generating absorptive enterocytes and secretory cell types.

Third, **niche dependency** is the requirement for specific, exogenously supplied factors to sustain growth and [self-renewal](@entry_id:156504). Unlike transformed cell lines that may proliferate uncontrollably, [organoid](@entry_id:163459) stem cells depend on signals that mimic their physiological niche. For many [epithelial tissues](@entry_id:261324), this includes factors that activate the Wnt signaling pathway, such as Wnt ligands and R-spondin, mitogens like Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), and inhibitors of differentiation pathways, such as the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) antagonist Noggin. The withdrawal of these essential niche factors leads to the cessation of growth and eventual collapse of the culture, demonstrating a reliance on physiological [homeostatic mechanisms](@entry_id:141716).

#### A Taxonomy of Preclinical Models: PDOs, PDXs, and CDXs

With a clear definition of an [organoid](@entry_id:163459), we can now place PDOs within the broader context of other preclinical models, including **patient-derived xenografts (PDXs)** and the older **cell line-derived xenografts (CDXs)**. These models are best distinguished by their origin, culture environment, and microenvironmental context [@problem_id:4366581].

*   **Patient-Derived Organoids (PDOs)**, as defined above, are three-dimensional ($3$D) *in vitro* cultures established directly from a patient's tumor tissue. They are typically initiated by embedding dissociated epithelial cells or small tissue fragments into an ECM scaffold (e.g., Matrigel) and supplying a defined liquid medium containing the necessary niche factors. Their key strength is the preservation of patient-specific, cell-autonomous features in a highly controlled and scalable *in vitro* setting. However, by default, PDOs lack the native [tumor microenvironment](@entry_id:152167) (TME); they are devoid of vasculature, immune cells, and a complex stromal architecture unless these components are intentionally reconstituted through co-culture techniques.

*   **Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDXs)** are *in vivo* models generated by transplanting fresh fragments of a patient's tumor or dissociated tumor cells into an immunodeficient mouse. The tumor grows within the mouse, forming a solid mass that can be serially passaged to other mice. In a PDX, the cancerous epithelial cells remain human, but the supporting stroma—including fibroblasts and the vascular network—is progressively replaced by cells of murine origin. This provides a systemic *in vivo* context for studying tumor growth and [drug response](@entry_id:182654), but introduces a chimeric microenvironment where human cancer cells interact with mouse stromal components.

*   **Cell Line-Derived Xenografts (CDXs)** are also *in vivo* mouse models, but they are established by implanting long-established, immortalized human cancer cell lines rather than fresh patient tissue. These cell lines have been adapted to grow indefinitely in $2$D culture, a process that often leads to the selection of homogenous, aggressive clones that have lost the genetic and [phenotypic heterogeneity](@entry_id:261639) of the original tumor. When grown as a CDX, these cells are supported by a murine stroma, similar to a PDX. While useful for their simplicity and [reproducibility](@entry_id:151299), CDXs are generally considered less representative of patient disease than PDOs or PDXs.

### Establishment and Maintenance: Engineering the Niche

The long-term success and biological relevance of PDOs and PDXs depend critically on the careful engineering of their respective niches—the *in vitro* matrix and medium for [organoids](@entry_id:153002), and the *in vivo* host environment for xenografts.

#### The PDO Niche: Matrix and Medium

The PDO niche is a synthetic ecosystem designed to provide both the physical and biochemical cues necessary for [self-organization](@entry_id:186805) and growth. This involves two key components: the extracellular matrix scaffold and the liquid culture medium.

##### The Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Scaffold

The ECM provides the physical support and adhesive cues for [organoid](@entry_id:163459) formation. Historically, the field has relied on **Matrigel**, a basement membrane extract derived from a mouse sarcoma. While effective, Matrigel suffers from an undefined composition and significant batch-to-batch variability, containing an unknown mix of ECM proteins and contaminating growth factors. This lack of definition is a major liability for precision medicine applications, where [reproducibility](@entry_id:151299) and control are paramount.

Consequently, there is a strong movement towards replacing Matrigel with fully defined, **synthetic hydrogels** [@problem_id:4366583]. Designing a successful synthetic matrix requires tuning three key physicochemical parameters: stiffness, ligand density, and porosity.

1.  **Stiffness (Young's Modulus, $E$)**: Cells sense and respond to the mechanical properties of their environment through a process called **mechanotransduction**. The stiffness of the ECM influences [cell shape](@entry_id:263285), proliferation, and differentiation, often through signaling pathways like the YAP/TAZ pathway. To maintain biological fidelity, the hydrogel's stiffness should be tuned to match that of the tissue of origin. For soft [epithelial tissues](@entry_id:261324) like the colon, this corresponds to a Young's modulus in the range of $E \approx 0.5$–$2\,\mathrm{kPa}$. A matrix that is too stiff can induce aberrant signaling and disrupt normal architecture.

2.  **Ligand Density**: Epithelial cells are anchorage-dependent and require specific adhesion ligands, such as the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide motif, to engage their integrin receptors. Synthetic [hydrogels](@entry_id:158652) can be functionalized with these ligands at a precise concentration, $c_L$. The goal is not to maximize adhesion but to achieve a moderate level of receptor occupancy ($\theta \approx 0.4$–$0.7$). Too little adhesion leads to cell death ([anoikis](@entry_id:262128)), while excessive, near-saturating adhesion can inhibit the dynamic cell movements required for [morphogenesis](@entry_id:154405).

3.  **Porosity and Mesh Size**: Organoids are avascular and rely on diffusion for all transport. The [hydrogel](@entry_id:198495) network must be permeable enough to allow nutrients, oxygen, and growth factors to reach the cells and waste products to diffuse away. This requires high porosity ($\varepsilon \gtrsim 0.7$) and a mesh size ($r_m$) large enough for key molecules to pass, typically in the range of $50$–$200\,\mathrm{nm}$. Failure to ensure adequate transport results in the formation of a necrotic core as the organoid grows.

##### The Biochemical Medium: A Symphony of Signals

The liquid medium provides the soluble factors that constitute the [stem cell niche](@entry_id:153620). For epithelial organoids, a "push-pull" model of signaling is often employed to maintain a balance between [stem cell self-renewal](@entry_id:264497) and differentiation [@problem_id:4366619]. The core pathways involved are Wnt, BMP, and EGF.

*   **The Wnt/$\beta$-catenin Pathway (Pro-Stemness)**: This is the primary driver of stemness in many epithelia. Activation of this pathway, typically via the Frizzled-LRP5/6 receptor complex, leads to the stabilization of $\beta$-catenin and transcription of stem cell-associated genes like $LGR5$. To achieve robust activation, the medium usually contains two key components:
    *   **$\mathrm{Wnt3a}$**: An exogenous Wnt ligand that directly activates the pathway.
    *   **R-spondin**: A potent Wnt agonist. R-spondin functions by binding to its receptors, LGR4/5/6, and inhibiting the E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF43 and ZNRF3. These ligases normally target Frizzled receptors for degradation. By inhibiting them, R-spondin increases the number of Wnt receptors on the cell surface, dramatically amplifying the cell's sensitivity to Wnt signals.

*   **The BMP/SMAD Pathway (Pro-Differentiation)**: Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) are potent drivers of differentiation, acting antagonistically to Wnt. BMPs signal through SMAD transcription factors to promote cell cycle exit and [lineage commitment](@entry_id:272776). To maintain a stem cell population, this pathway must be inhibited. This is achieved by adding:
    *   **Noggin**: A protein that acts as a BMP antagonist by directly binding to and sequestering BMP ligands, preventing them from engaging their receptors.

*   **The EGF/RTK Pathway (Pro-Proliferation)**: Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) is a mitogen that stimulates proliferation by activating [receptor tyrosine kinase](@entry_id:153267) (RTK) signaling cascades (e.g., RAS-MAPK, PI3K-AKT). EGF expands the overall cell population, including the transit-amplifying cells that lie between stem cells and fully differentiated cells, without directly dictating the stem-versus-differentiated fate decision.

Together, this combination of Wnt/R-spondin to "push" towards stemness, Noggin to block the "pull" towards differentiation, and EGF to drive proliferation creates a defined niche that supports the long-term culture of self-organizing [organoids](@entry_id:153002).

#### The PDX Niche: Host and Implantation Site

The niche for a PDX is the living organism of an immunodeficient mouse. The success and relevance of a PDX model depend on the choice of the host strain and the anatomical site of implantation.

##### The Immunodeficient Host

Human cells transplanted into a normal mouse would be rapidly rejected by the host immune system. Establishing a PDX therefore requires a host with severe immunodeficiencies. The degree of immunodeficiency directly impacts the probability of successful tumor engraftment, as key effectors of xenograft rejection must be absent [@problem_id:4366606]. Several strains are commonly used:

*   **NOD/SCID**: This strain combines the Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD) background with the Severe Combined Immunodeficiency ($Prkdc^{scid}$) mutation. The $Prkdc^{scid}$ mutation impairs V(D)J recombination, resulting in a lack of mature **T cells** and **B cells**. However, these mice still possess functional **Natural Killer (NK) cells**, which are potent mediators of xenograft rejection. The NOD background provides additional benefits, such as defects in complement and attenuated [macrophage phagocytosis](@entry_id:189514) of human cells, but the presence of NK cells limits engraftment efficiency for some tumor types.

*   **NSG (NOD scid gamma)**: This strain builds upon the NOD/SCID model by adding a null mutation in the [interleukin-2](@entry_id:193984) receptor [common gamma chain](@entry_id:204728) gene ($Il2rg^{null}$). The IL2rg subunit is essential for the function of receptors for several key cytokines, including IL-7 and IL-15, which are required for the development of NK cells. As a result, NSG mice lack not only T and B cells but also **NK cells**. This tripartite deficiency makes them one of the most profoundly immunodeficient strains available, leading to significantly higher engraftment rates for a wider variety of human tumors compared to NOD/SCID mice.

*   **NRG (NOD Rag gamma)**: This strain is functionally very similar to the NSG strain. It also features the NOD background and the $Il2rg^{null}$ mutation, resulting in the same innate immune defects. The key difference is the use of a $Rag1^{null}$ or $Rag2^{null}$ mutation instead of $Prkdc^{scid}$ to ablate [adaptive immunity](@entry_id:137519). Since RAG proteins are also essential for V(D)J recombination, NRG mice also lack mature T and B cells. For the purposes of tumor engraftment, the resulting immune phenotype ($T^{-}B^{-}NK^{-}$) is equivalent to that of NSG mice, and they exhibit similarly high engraftment efficiencies: Engraftment (NSG $\approx$ NRG) $>$ Engraftment (NOD/SCID).

##### Implantation Site: Orthotopic vs. Ectopic

The location where the tumor tissue is implanted has profound consequences for the model's biological fidelity [@problem_id:4366612].

*   **Ectopic Implantation**: The most common and technically simplest approach is subcutaneous implantation, typically in the flank of the mouse. This is an **ectopic** (non-native) site. While tumors grown here are easy to monitor and measure with calipers, the microenvironment of the subcutaneous space is not representative of most visceral organs. This can lead to altered gene expression, growth patterns, and drug responses.

*   **Orthotopic Implantation**: This approach involves implanting the tumor tissue into its corresponding organ of origin in the mouse (e.g., pancreatic tumor tissue into the mouse pancreas, or breast tumor tissue into the mouse mammary fat pad). Although technically more challenging, **orthotopic** implantation offers significantly higher fidelity. By placing the tumor in its native context, the model can recapitulate:
    *   **Organ-specific TME interactions**: The tumor interacts with the correct types of stromal cells and ECM, which provide critical paracrine signals that shape tumor behavior. This is crucial for studying therapies whose efficacy is limited by stromal barriers, such as in pancreatic cancer.
    *   **Clinically relevant metastatic patterns**: An orthotopically implanted tumor is integrated into the native organ's lymphatic and vascular drainage systems, allowing it to metastasize to clinically relevant secondary sites (e.g., from pancreas to liver). Ectopic tumors metastasize based on the drainage of the subcutaneous site, which is often not representative.
    *   **Organ-specific drug delivery**: Drug pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration differ greatly between organs. An orthotopic model provides a more accurate assessment of a drug's ability to reach its target within the relevant organ.
    *   **Endocrine signaling**: For hormone-dependent cancers like ER-positive breast cancer, the orthotopic site (the mammary fat pad) provides essential local endocrine signals (e.g., local estrogen synthesis by adipocytes) that are absent in ectopic sites, making it indispensable for testing endocrine therapies.

### Model Fidelity: Measuring and Understanding Divergence

A central question in the use of PDOs and PDXs is their **fidelity**: how well do they represent the original patient tumor from which they were derived? Fidelity is not a monolithic property; it must be assessed across multiple scales, from the genome to the microenvironment, and it is not static, as models evolve over time.

#### Assessing Genomic Fidelity

With the advent of affordable [whole-genome sequencing](@entry_id:169777) (WGS), it is now possible to quantify the genomic similarity between a patient tumor and its derived models. A rigorous fidelity assessment should be based on principled metrics across three key domains of somatic alterations: copy number variations (CNVs), mutational spectra, and structural variants (SVs) [@problem_id:4366618].

*   **Copy Number Variation (CNV) Fidelity**: CNVs are large-scale gains and losses of chromosomal segments. A robust metric should compare the continuous log2 copy number ratios across the genome, rather than coarse integer calls which can be skewed by differences in tumor purity. To account for the biological importance of large-scale events (e.g., arm-level changes), the comparison, typically a **Pearson correlation ($r_{\text{CNV}}$)**, should be weighted by the length of the genomic segments. A high, length-weighted correlation ($r_{\text{CNV}} \ge 0.85$) indicates that the large-scale architecture of the genome is well-preserved.

*   **Mutational Spectra Fidelity**: The pattern of single base substitutions (SBS) in a tumor reflects the mutational processes that have been active during its development (e.g., due to UV exposure or defective DNA repair). This is captured by the **mutational spectrum**, a 96-channel vector representing the frequency of each possible substitution within its 3'- and 5'-base trinucleotide context. A principled comparison requires normalizing these mutation counts by the frequency of each trinucleotide in the genome (the "opportunity") to yield a true mutational profile. The similarity of these profiles between tumor and model is then typically measured using **[cosine similarity](@entry_id:634957) ($S_{\text{mut}}$)**. Because mutational processes are a stable feature of a tumor's etiology, a very high similarity is expected in a faithful model ($S_{\text{mut}} \ge 0.90$).

*   **Structural Variant (SV) Fidelity**: SVs are complex rearrangements like deletions, duplications, and translocations. Their detection is noisier than for single-nucleotide variants, with inherent uncertainty in breakpoint locations. Therefore, a fidelity metric cannot demand exact breakpoint matches. Instead, a robust approach uses an **interval-based Jaccard index ($J_{\text{SV}}$)**. Here, a tolerance window (e.g., $\pm 200$ bp) is placed around each breakpoint, and the Jaccard index is calculated on the sets of these breakpoint intervals. This properly accounts for detection noise while penalizing both missing and spurious SV calls. Due to the technical challenges in SV detection, the expected concordance is lower than for other variant types ($J_{\text{SV}} \ge 0.50$).

A composite fidelity score, combining these metrics with appropriate weights and minimal floors for each, provides a comprehensive and scientifically defensible framework for declaring a model's genomic fidelity as acceptable.

#### Clonal Evolution in Patient-Derived Models

Genomic fidelity is not static. The process of establishing and passaging a PDO or PDX imposes new selection pressures, causing the clonal composition of the tumor to evolve. This means that the model can diverge from the patient's tumor over time. Understanding the principles of this evolution is key to interpreting experimental data [@problem_id:4366623].

The environments of a PDO and a PDX exert different selection pressures. PDO culture, with its [defined medium](@entry_id:185972), primarily selects for clones with the highest **epithelial-intrinsic fitness**—those that are best adapted to proliferate using the provided niche factors. In contrast, PDX growth *in vivo* selects for clones that are best able to co-opt the murine host environment, including interacting with mouse stroma, inducing [angiogenesis](@entry_id:149600), and evading residual innate immune surveillance. This means a tumor composed of multiple clones may evolve in different directions depending on the model system used. For instance, a clone that is dominant in the patient due to its interactions with the human TME might be outcompeted in PDO culture by a clone with a higher intrinsic proliferation rate. Conversely, that same intrinsically fast-growing clone might fare poorly in a PDX if it cannot effectively recruit a murine blood supply.

This divergence is particularly relevant when considering the fate of specific subclones, such as those that confer therapy resistance [@problem_id:4366562]. Often, a resistance mutation comes with a **fitness cost** in a drug-free environment. When a tumor from a treated patient is placed into drug-free culture, a resistant subclone may be less fit than the original truncal driver clone. Due to this [negative selection](@entry_id:175753), the resistant subclone's frequency will deterministically decrease over time.

Furthermore, the very process of initiating a culture introduces a **stochastic bottleneck**. Only a small number of cells from the biopsy (the "founders") will successfully establish the new PDO or PDX. If a subclone is present at a low frequency in the original tumor, or if its cells have a lower intrinsic ability to initiate a culture (e.g., lower stem cell properties), it can be lost purely by chance during this founding event. The combination of this initial stochastic loss and subsequent deterministic negative selection provides a powerful mechanistic explanation for why therapy-induced resistant subclones are often lost during the establishment of patient-derived models, while the more robust truncal driver clones are retained.

#### Fidelity of the Microenvironment: The Cross-Species Challenge

Perhaps the most significant difference between PDOs and PDXs lies in the composition of their microenvironment, specifically the stroma. While PDOs in monoculture are purely epithelial, they can be co-cultured with patient-derived [cancer-associated fibroblasts](@entry_id:187462) (CAFs) to create an all-human *in vitro* TME. In contrast, the stroma of a PDX is almost entirely replaced by mouse cells after engraftment.

This species difference is not a trivial detail; it can have profound functional consequences due to species-specific ligand-receptor interactions [@problem_id:4366611]. Paracrine signaling between fibroblasts and cancer cells is a major driver of [tumor progression](@entry_id:193488) and [drug resistance](@entry_id:261859). However, a growth factor secreted by a mouse fibroblast may not bind to its cognate receptor on a human cancer cell with the same affinity as its human counterpart.

Consider the HGF/MET signaling pathway, a known mediator of resistance to EGFR inhibitors. A hypothetical scenario illustrates the principle:
- In a **PDO co-culture** with human CAFs, human HGF is secreted and binds to human MET receptors on the cancer cells with high affinity (e.g., dissociation constant $K_D = 0.5\,\mathrm{nM}$). This leads to high receptor occupancy and strong pathway activation, conferring robust drug resistance.
- In a **PDX**, the murine CAFs secrete mouse HGF. If mouse HGF binds to human MET with a much lower affinity (e.g., a higher $K_D = 5.0\,\mathrm{nM}$), then even at the same ligand concentration, the fractional receptor occupancy will be significantly lower. This results in attenuated MET signaling and, consequently, a weaker [drug resistance](@entry_id:261859) phenotype compared to the all-human PDO co-culture.

This highlights a critical caveat of PDX models: they may underestimate resistance mechanisms that rely on specific human-human paracrine interactions. Conversely, it showcases the power of PDO co-culture systems to dissect these human-specific interactions in a controlled setting.

### Synthesis: Choosing the Right Model for the Right Question

Patient-derived organoids and xenografts are not interchangeable; they are complementary tools with distinct strengths and weaknesses rooted in the principles outlined above. The selection of a model must be guided by the specific biological question being asked.

*   **PDOs** are the model of choice for **[high-throughput screening](@entry_id:271166)** of drugs that target epithelial-intrinsic vulnerabilities. Their [scalability](@entry_id:636611), speed, and defined *in vitro* environment allow for the rapid testing of many compounds and concentrations, providing a clean readout of a drug's direct effect on the cancer cells [@problem_id:4366623]. Co-culture systems extend their utility to studying specific human stromal or immune interactions.

*   **PDXs** are indispensable when the biological question involves the complexity of a whole organism. They are required for studying **in vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD)**, evaluating therapies that target the tumor microenvironment (such as **anti-angiogenic agents**), and observing systemic processes like **spontaneous metastasis**. For questions involving the adaptive immune system, such as testing **immune checkpoint inhibitors**, PDX models must be established in even more advanced "humanized" mice that have been engrafted with a functional human immune system.

By understanding the fundamental principles and mechanisms governing their establishment, maintenance, and fidelity, researchers can leverage the unique advantages of each patient-derived model to accelerate the discovery and implementation of effective precision oncology strategies.
