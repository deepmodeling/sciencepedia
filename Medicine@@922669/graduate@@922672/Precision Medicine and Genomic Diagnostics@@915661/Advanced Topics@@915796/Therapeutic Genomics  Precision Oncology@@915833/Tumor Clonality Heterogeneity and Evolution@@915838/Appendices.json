This fundamental exercise [@problem_id:4394070] walks you through the first principles of this deconvolution, a cornerstone skill for any genomic diagnostician.", "problem": "A solid tumor biopsy is subjected to deep whole-genome sequencing and allele-specific copy-number analysis. At a locus of interest, the following are established by orthogonal analyses:\n\n- Tumor purity is $p = 0.70$; the remaining fraction $1 - p$ is normal diploid tissue.\n- Across all tumor cells, the total copy number at this locus is constant and equal to $C = 3$ with a major:minor configuration of $2:1$ (no loss of heterozygosity).\n- Sequencing is sufficiently deep that sampling variance of the variant allele fraction (VAF) estimates is negligible.\n- Three single-nucleotide variants are observed at this locus:\n  1. A truncal mutation $T$ present in all tumor cells with multiplicity $m_{T} = 1$ per tumor cell that carries it. Its measured VAF is $v_{T} = 0.25926$.\n  2.

No units are required.", "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of cancer genomics, is mathematically well-posed, and contains a complete and consistent set of data.\n\nThe central principle for solving this problem is the mathematical relationship between the measured variant allele fraction (VAF) of a mutation and the underlying biological parameters of the tissue sample. The VAF, denoted by $v$, is the ratio of the number of sequencing reads reporting the variant allele to the total number of reads covering that genomic position. In a mixed sample of tumor and normal cells, the expected VAF for a somatic mutation can be modeled as:\n$$ v = \\frac{\\text{variant allele copies}}{\\text{total allele copies}} $$\nThis can be expressed as a function of tumor purity ($p$), the fraction of tumor cells carrying the mutation (cancer cell fraction, $\\phi$), the number of copies of the mutation per cell that has it (multiplicity, $m$), the total copy number in tumor cells ($C$), and the total copy number in normal cells ($C_N$).\n\nThe total number of alleles in the sample is a weighted average of the alleles from the tumor and normal cell populations. Let $N_{avg}$ be the average total copy number at the locus across the entire sample. It is given by:\n$$ N_{avg} = p \\cdot C + (1-p) \\cdot C_N $$\nThe number of variant alleles is contributed only by the fraction $\\phi$ of tumor cells, as the mutations are somatic. The number of variant allele copies, normalized to the same population size, is $p \\cdot \\phi \\cdot m$.\nTherefore, the VAF formula is:\n$$ v = \\frac{p \\cdot \\phi \\cdot m}{N_{avg}} = \\frac{p \\cdot \\phi \\cdot m}{p \\cdot C + (1-p) \\cdot C_N} $$\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following givens:\n- Tumor purity: $p = 0.70$\n- Tumor cell copy number: $C = 3$\n- Normal cell copy number: $C_N = 2$ (diploid)\n\nFirst, we calculate the average copy number $N_{avg}$ for the sample:\n$$ N_{avg} = (0.70)(3) + (1-0.70)(2) = 2.1 + (0.30)(2) = 2.1 + 0.6 = 2.7 $$\nAs a check for consistency, we can calculate the expected VAF for the truncal mutation $T$. For this mutation, we are given $m_T=1$, and since it is truncal, it is present in all tumor cells, so its cancer cell fraction is $\\phi_T=1$.\n$$ v_T = \\frac{p \\cdot \\phi_T \\cdot m_T}{N_{avg}} = \\frac{(0.70)(1)(1)}{2.7} = \\frac{0.7}{2.7} = \\frac{7}{27} \\approx 0.259259... $$\nThis theoretical value matches the measured VAF, $v_T = 0.25926$, confirming the consistency of the provided parameters.\n\nOur goal is to find the fraction of tumor cells that are truncal-only. Let this fraction be $\\phi_0$. Let $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ be the fractions of tumor cells belonging to subclones $S_1$ and $S_2$, respectively. Since these subclones are mutually exclusive branches from the truncal population, the fractions must sum to one:\n$$ \\phi_0 + \\phi_1 + \\phi_2 = 1 $$\nTo find $\\phi_0$, we first need to determine $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$. We can rearrange the VAF formula to solve for the cancer cell fraction $\\phi$:\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{v \\cdot N_{avg}}{p \\cdot m} $$\nNow we apply this formula to each subclone.\n\nFor subclone $S_1$, we are given:\n- Measured VAF: $v_1 = 0.12963$\n- Multiplicity: $m_1 = 1$\nThe fraction of tumor cells in subclone $S_1$ is $\\phi_1$:\n$$ \\phi_1 = \\frac{v_1 \\cdot N_{avg}}{p \\cdot m_1} = \\frac{(0.12963)(2.7)}{(0.70)(1)} = \\frac{0.350001}{0.7} \\approx 0.5000014 $$\nThe value is clearly intended to be $\\phi_1 = 0.5$.

Let sources $s \\in \\{\\text{tumor}, \\text{leukocyte}, \\text{other}\\}$ with fractions $f_T$, $f_L$, and $f_O$, respectively, satisfying $f_T + f_L + f_O = 1$. For a heterozygous mutation in a diploid region ($P_s = 2$, $M_s = 1$), a clone fraction $c_s$ contributes a mutated allele fraction $c_s \\cdot (M_s / P_s) = c_s \\cdot (1/2)$ within source $s$.

Fragmentomics shows KRAS-mutant reads enriched in shorter fragments (modal length near $145$ base pairs), a well-supported hallmark of tumor-derived cfDNA. Taken together, first principles predict that KRAS $p.G12D$ is tumor-derived and likely clonal in the tumor-derived cfDNA.\n\nDNMT3A $p.R882H$:\n- DNMT3A is a canonical clonal hematopoiesis gene.

Assuming copy-number neutrality in leukocytes at DNMT3A and heterozygosity ($P_L = 2$, $M_L = 1$), the expected plasma DNMT3A VAF is\n$$\n\\mathrm{VAF}_{\\text{leukocyte, DNMT3A}} = f_L \\cdot c_L \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 0.78 \\cdot 0.020 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 0.78 \\cdot 0.010 = 0.0078 = 0.78\\%.\n$$\n- Any tumor contribution at DNMT3A would require the tumor to harbor the same variant; there is no evidence for DNMT3A mutation in the tumor tissue sequencing. The observed plasma DNMT3A VAF of $0.9\\%$ closely matches the predicted $0.78\\%$, within expected technical and biological variability. Fragmentomics shows enrichment in longer fragments (modal length near $166$ base pairs), consistent with hematopoietic origin. Thus, first principles predict that DNMT3A $p.R882H$ arises from clonal hematopoiesis.\n\nConsistency checks:\n- The sum of sources satisfies $f_T + f_L + f_O = 1$. With $f_T = 0.048$ and $f_L = 0.78$, the residual $f_O = 1 - 0.048 - 0.78 = 0.172$, which can contribute wild-type background at both loci but does not contribute mutated alleles in the absence of the mutation in those sources.\n- The fragment size distributions match expected tissue-of-origin patterns: shorter for tumor-derived KRAS and longer for leukocyte-derived DNMT3A.\n- The matched sample results align with the mixture-model expectations: KRAS absent in WBC, DNMT3A present in WBC at a level that, when propagated through the mixture model, recapitulates the plasma VAF.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- Option A: Asserts KRAS arises from clonal hematopoiesis and DNMT3A from the tumor, with the next step being increased plasma depth without matched samples. This contradicts multiple lines: KRAS is absent in WBC, present in tumor tissue, exhibits short-fragment enrichment, and its plasma VAF matches $f_T \\cdot (1/2)$ for a clonal tumor mutation. DNMT3A is detected in WBC, a hallmark of clonal hematopoiesis, and exhibits long-fragment enrichment. Furthermore, eschewing matched samples disregards the fundamental need to disambiguate tissue-of-origin in cfDNA mixtures. Incorrect.\n- Option B: Concludes KRAS is tumor-derived and largely clonal; DNMT3A arises from clonal hematopoiesis; and recommends integrating matched WBC and tumor data with mixture-model parameters ($f_T$, $f_L$) and fragmentomics. This aligns with the quantitative derivations: KRAS expected $\\approx 2.4\\%$ versus observed $2.6\\%$, DNMT3A expected $\\approx 0.78\\%$ versus observed $0.9\\%$, with tissue-of-origin fragment and methylation signals supporting these assignments. Correct.\n- Option C: Claims both variants are tumor-derived and recommends tumor-only sequencing while discounting fragment length and WBC findings. This violates the mixture-model inference and ignores the direct evidence of DNMT3A in WBC (and the absence of DNMT3A in tumor), as well as the fragmentomics and methylation data indicating distinct tissue origins. Incorrect.\n- Option D: Claims both variants are clonal hematopoiesis due to hematopoietic cfDNA dominance and recommends relying exclusively on WBC sequencing while ignoring tumor fraction. While hematopoietic cfDNA is the largest fraction, the KRAS plasma VAF quantitatively matches a tumor-derived heterozygous variant at $f_T = 0.048$, and KRAS is absent in WBC but present in tumor tissue with short-fragment enrichment, making a CHIP origin implausible.
