The problem specifies a linear relationship for the conventional outflow rate through the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal, given by the product of the outflow facility ($C$) and the pressure gradient driving the flow.

In the conventional (trabecular) outflow pathway, aqueous humor exits the anterior chamber through the trabecular meshwork into Schlemm’s canal, driven by the pressure gradient between the intraocular pressure and episcleral venous pressure. Consider the following scientifically established bases:\n- Muscarinic receptor activation in the ciliary muscle triggers contraction of its longitudinal fibers that insert into the scleral spur and trabecular meshwork, altering the meshwork’s configuration and the patency of Schlemm’s canal.\n- At steady state, aqueous humor inflow equals pressure-driven trabecular outflow.\n- Outflow facility, denoted by $C$, is defined as the proportionality constant relating trabecular outflow to the pressure gradient across the trabecular pathway.\n\nAssume a patient has a baseline aqueous humor inflow rate $F$ that remains unchanged during pilocarpine administration, and that under muscarinic stimulation the uveoscleral pathway becomes negligible so that all inflow exits via the trabecular route.

It is also given that muscarinic receptor activation in the ciliary muscle causes its longitudinal fibers to contract. These fibers insert into the scleral spur and trabecular meshwork. This contraction physically pulls on the trabecular meshwork, widening the intertrabecular spaces and expanding the lumen of Schlemm’s canal. This structural change reduces the hydraulic resistance to aqueous humor outflow. The outflow facility, $C$, is the inverse of resistance. Therefore, by reducing resistance, pilocarpine increases the outflow facility. This is consistent with the data provided, where $C$ increases from $C_{\\text{base}} = 0.2$ to $C_{\\text{drug}} = 0.28$ microliters per minute per millimeter of mercury.\n\n**Derivation of the Steady-State Relationship**\n\nThe problem provides two fundamental principles for the derivation:\n$1.$ At steady state, the rate of aqueous humor inflow, $F$, must equal the rate of aqueous humor outflow, $F_{\\text{out}}$.\n$$F = F_{\\text{out}}$$\n$2.$ The trabecular outflow rate, $F_{\\text{out}}$, is proportional to the pressure gradient between the intraocular pressure, $P_{0}$, and the episcleral venous pressure, $P_{v}$. The constant of proportionality is the outflow facility, $C$.\n$$F_{\\text{out}} = C (P_{0} - P_{v})$$\nBy substituting the first equation into the second, we obtain the steady-state relationship that links the four variables:\n$$F = C (P_{0} - P_{v})$$\nThis is the well-known Goldmann equation for aqueous humor dynamics, assuming total outflow occurs through the trabecular pathway. The problem asks for the relationship linking $P_0$ to the other variables, so we rearrange the equation to solve for $P_{0}$:\n$$P_{0} = \\frac{F}{C} + P_{v}$$\n\n**Calculation of the Change in Intraocular Pressure, $\\Delta P_{0}$**\n\nWe use the derived relationship to find the intraocular pressure before and after the administration of pilocarpine. The inflow rate $F$ and episcleral venous pressure $P_{v}$ are assumed to be constant.\n\nThe baseline intraocular pressure, $P_{0,\\text{base}}$, with facility $C_{\\text{base}}$ is:\n$$P_{0,\\text{base}} = \\frac{F}{C_{\\text{base}}} + P_{v}$$\nThe intraocular pressure after drug administration, $P_{0,\\text{drug}}$, with facility $C_{\\text{drug}}$ is:\n$$P_{0,\\text{drug}} = \\frac{F}{C_{\\text{drug}}} + P_{v}$$\nThe change in intraocular pressure, $\\Delta P_{0}$, is the difference between the drug-induced pressure and the baseline pressure:\n$$\\Delta P_{0} = P_{0,\\text{drug}} - P_{0,\\text{base}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for each pressure:\n$$\\Delta P_{0} = \\left(\\frac{F}{C_{\\text{drug}}} + P_{v}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{F}{C_{\\text{base}}} + P_{v}\\right)$$\nThe term $P_{v}$ cancels out, yielding:\n$$\\Delta P_{0} = \\frac{F}{C_{\\text{drug}}} - \\frac{F}{C_{\\text{base}}} = F \\left(\\frac{1}{C_{\\text{drug}}} - \\frac{1}{C_{\\text{base}}}\\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement:\n$F = 2.5$ microliters per minute.\n$C_{\\text{base}} = 0.2$ microliters per minute per millimeter of mercury.\n$C_{\\text{drug}} = 0.28$ microliters per minute per millimeter of mercury.\n\n$$\\Delta P_{0} = 2.5 \\left(\\frac{1}{0.28} - \\frac{1}{0.2}\\right)$$\nThe units are consistent, resulting in millimeters of mercury.

The relationship between the effect $E$ and the concentration $C$ is described by a model that combines equilibrium receptor occupancy and linear signal transduction.\n\nThe statement that \"fractional receptor occupancy is a rectangular-hyperbola function of concentration\" corresponds to the Hill-Langmuir equation with a Hill coefficient of $1$.

This can be expressed as $E(C) = k \\cdot \\theta(C)$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality. The maximal effect, $E_{\\max}$, is achieved as the concentration $C$ becomes very large, causing the occupancy $\\theta$ to approach its maximum value of $1$.
