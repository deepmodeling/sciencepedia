The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem is centered on the Friedenwald ocular rigidity framework, which empirically states that the fractional change in pressure per unit change in intraocular volume is a constant. This is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\ln P)}{dV} = \\text{constant}\n$$\nThe problem defines a parameter $\\alpha$ as the inverse of this constant:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{d(\\ln P)}{dV} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{dV}{d(\\ln P)}\n$$\nThis provides a direct relationship between an infinitesimal change in volume, $dV$, and an infinitesimal change in the natural logarithm of pressure, $d(\\ln P)$. We can rearrange this to form a differential equation:\n$$\ndV = \\alpha \\cdot d(\\ln P)\n$$\nUsing the chain rule for differentiation, we know that $d(\\ln P) = \\frac{1}{P} dP$. Substituting this into our equation gives:\n$$\ndV = \\alpha \\frac{dP}{P}\n$$\nThis equation relates the change in volume to the change in pressure. The instantaneous compliance, $C(P)$, is defined as the rate of change of volume with respect to pressure, $C(P) = \\frac{dV}{dP}$. From our derived relation, we can express the pressure-dependent compliance as:\n$$\nC(P) = \\frac{dV}{dP} = \\frac{\\alpha}{P}\n$$\nTo find the total infused volume, $\\Delta V$, required to raise the pressure from $P_1$ to $P_2$, we must integrate the differential equation for $dV$ between the corresponding pressure limits. Let the initial volume be $V_1$ at pressure $P_1$ and the final volume be $V_2$ at pressure $P_2$.\n$$\n\\int_{V_1}^{V_2} dV = \\int_{P_1}^{P_2} \\alpha \\frac{dP}{P}\n$$\nThe left side integrates to $\\Delta V = V_2 - V_1$. Since $\\alpha$ is a constant, we can take it out of the integral on the right side:\n$$\n\\Delta V = \\alpha \\int_{P_1}^{P_2} \\frac{1}{P} dP\n$$\nThe integral of $\\frac{1}{P}$ with respect to $P$ is $\\ln(|P|)$. Since pressure $P$ is always positive in this context, we can write $\\ln(P)$. Evaluating the definite integral yields:\n$$\n\\Delta V = \\alpha \\left[ \\ln(P) \\right]_{P_1}^{P_2} = \\alpha (\\ln(P_2) - \\ln(P_1))\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta V = \\alpha \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right)\n$$\nWe are given $P_1 = 15$ mmHg, $P_2 = 25$ mmHg, and $\\alpha = 0.03$ mL. Substituting these values:\n$$\n\\Delta V = 0.03 \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{25}{15}\\right) = 0.03 \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)\n$$\nNumerically, $\\ln(5/3) \\approx 0.5108256$.\n$$\n\\Delta V \\approx 0.03 \\times 0.5108256 \\approx 0.015324768 \\text{ mL}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the total infused volume is $\\Delta V = 0.0153$ mL.\n\nNext, we compute the average compliance, $\\bar{C}$, over the pressure range from $P_1$ to $P_2$. The most direct definition of average compliance over an interval is the total change in volume divided by the total change in pressure:\n$$\n\\bar{C} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta P} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{P_2 - P_1}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta V$ and $\\Delta P$:\n$$\n\\bar{C} = \\frac{\\alpha \\ln(P_2/P_1)}{P_2 - P_1}\n$$\nUsing the given numerical values:\n$$\n\\bar{C} = \\frac{0.015324768 \\text{ mL}}{(25 - 15) \\text{ mmHg}} = \\frac{0.015324768}{10} \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{mmHg}} \\approx 0.0015324768 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{mmHg}}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the average compliance is $\\bar{C} = 0.00153$ mL/mmHg.\n\n### Interpretation of Average Compliance\nThe average compliance, $\\bar{C} \\approx 0.00153$ mL/mmHg, quantifies the eye's volumetric distensibility over the pressure range of $15$ mmHg to $25$ mmHg. It signifies that, on average, an infusion of $0.00153$ mL of fluid is required to raise the intraocular pressure by $1$ mmHg within this range. The inverse of compliance is stiffness (or elastance). An average stiffness for the globe in this regime would be $1/\\bar{C} \\approx 1/0.00153 \\approx 654$ mmHg/mL. The low value of compliance (and correspondingly high value of stiffness) indicates that the ocular globe is quite rigid. This means the eye has a limited capacity to accommodate additional volume; even a small increase in volume (here, about $15$ microliters) leads to a substantial increase in intraocular pressure (a $10$ mmHg rise). This low distensibility is crucial for maintaining the eye's shape and optical integrity but also implies that conditions affecting fluid drainage (like in glaucoma) can rapidly lead to pathologically high pressures.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.0153 & 0.00153\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4716301"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the whole globe to the tissue level, we explore the fact that biological tissues like the cornea rarely exhibit simple linear elasticity.

The strain is specified to be in the small-strain regime, consistent with the evaluation point $\\varepsilon=0.05$, which satisfies $\\varepsilon \\ll 1$.\n\nThe tangent modulus, denoted here as $E_t$, is defined as the instantaneous incremental stiffness, which corresponds to the first derivative of the stress with respect to strain. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nE_t(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\varepsilon}\n$$\nTo find the expression for the tangent modulus, we differentiate the given constitutive relation with respect to $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\nE_t(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{d}{d\\varepsilon}(a\\varepsilon + b\\varepsilon^2)\n$$\nApplying the rules of differentiation, we obtain:\n$$\nE_t(\\varepsilon) = a + 2b\\varepsilon\n$$\nThis expression demonstrates that the tangent modulus is not a constant but a linear function of the strain $\\varepsilon$. This strain-dependent stiffness is a hallmark of non-linear elastic materials, such as many biological soft tissues. The initial stiffness at zero strain ($\\varepsilon=0$) is simply $E_t(0) = a$.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the tangent modulus at a specific strain of $\\varepsilon=0.05$.

The tangent modulus, $E_t$, quantifies the cornea's instantaneous stiffness or resistance to an infinitesimal incremental deformation at a given level of pre-strain. The calculated value, $E_t(0.05) \\approx 0.510\\,\\text{MPa}$, represents the stiffness of the corneal tissue when it is already stretched by $5\\%$.\n\nThis value is not the stiffness of the cornea in an unstressed state. The initial stiffness at zero strain is $E_t(0) = a = 0.3\\,\\text{MPa}$. The fact that $E_t(0.05) > E_t(0)$ reflects the strain-stiffening behavior of the cornea, as described by the positive quadratic term in the constitutive model. This stiffening is a critical biomechanical feature, attributed to the progressive uncrimping and recruitment of collagen fibrils within the corneal stroma. As the tissue is stretched, more collagen fibers align with the direction of tensile load and become taut, contributing to the overall stiffness.\n\nIn the physiological context, IOP is not static; it undergoes small fluctuations (e.g., diurnal variations, effects of pulse pressure, or external perturbations during an eye examination). These fluctuations impose small, additional strains on the cornea, superimposed on the baseline strain from the mean IOP. The tangent modulus at the operating strain level (determined by the mean IOP) dictates how much the cornea will deform in response to these pressure increments. A higher tangent modulus implies a stiffer cornea that will exhibit smaller deformations for a given change in IOP. This enhanced stiffness at higher strains is a crucial protective mechanism, ensuring the cornea maintains its precise optical shape and structural integrity under transient elevations in pressure, thereby preserving stable vision and preventing mechanical failure.
