This first practice focuses on achieving isotonicity, a critical property that ensures a topical drug is compatible with the tear film to maximize patient comfort and minimize corneal irritation. By working through this calculation, you will apply the concept of sodium chloride equivalents to adjust the tonicity of a drug solution, a core skill in ophthalmic pharmaceutical compounding [@problem_id:4729940].", "problem": "A compounding pharmacist is formulating an ophthalmic solution of a beta-adrenergic antagonist (therapeutic class: beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists) for topical administration. For ocular comfort and corneal safety, the solution should be isotonic with human tears. It is a widely accepted formulation standard that an isotonic sodium chloride reference solution contains $0.9$ grams of sodium chloride per $100$ milliliters. The pharmacist prepares the drug at a concentration of $0.5$ grams per $100$ milliliters. The sodium chloride equivalent, denoted by $E$, of the drug is defined as the mass of sodium chloride that produces the same colligative effect (for example, the same osmotic pressure via the van ’t Hoff relation $\\pi = i M R T$ in the dilute limit) as $1$ gram of the drug in the same volume under identical conditions. For this drug, $E = 0.22$.\n\nStarting from the principle that isotonicity requires equality of colligative effects (that is, the sum of the osmotic contributions of all solutes in the formulation must match that of $0.9$ grams of sodium chloride per $100$ milliliters), determine the mass of sodium chloride that must be added per $100$ milliliters of the $0.5$ grams per $100$ milliliters drug solution to render it isotonic with tears.

It presents a standard pharmaceutical calculation based on the principles of isotonicity and colligative properties, using the established method of sodium chloride equivalents. All necessary data are provided, and the problem is free of contradictions or ambiguities. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle for formulating an isotonic solution is that the total osmotic pressure of the formulation must be equal to the osmotic pressure of a reference biological fluid, in this case, human tears. This is equivalent to stating that the formulation must have the same colligative properties as the reference fluid. The problem specifies that a solution containing $0.9$ grams of sodium chloride ($\\text{NaCl}$) per $100$ milliliters ($\\text{mL}$) of solution is isotonic with tears. This serves as our reference standard.\n\nLet $m_{\\text{target, NaCl}}$ be the mass of $\\text{NaCl}$ in grams that would produce an isotonic solution in a volume of $100 \\text{ mL}$. From the problem statement, we are given:\n$$m_{\\text{target, NaCl}} = 0.9 \\text{ g}$$\n\nThe final formulation will contain two solutes: the beta-adrenergic antagonist drug and the added sodium chloride. For the solution to be isotonic, the sum of the osmotic contributions of these two solutes must equal the osmotic contribution of the reference $\\text{NaCl}$ solution. The concept of the sodium chloride equivalent, $E$, allows us to quantify the osmotic contribution of a given substance in terms of the mass of $\\text{NaCl}$ that would produce the same effect.\n\nThe sodium chloride equivalent of the drug, $E_{\\text{drug}}$, is given as $0.22$. This means that $1$ gram of the drug contributes to the osmotic pressure as much as $0.22$ grams of $\\text{NaCl}$.\nThe concentration of the drug in the solution is $0.5$ grams per $100 \\text{ mL}$. Let $m_{\\text{drug}}$ be the mass of the drug in this volume.\n$$m_{\\text{drug}} = 0.5 \\text{ g}$$\n\nThe osmotic contribution of the drug, expressed as an equivalent mass of $\\text{NaCl}$ ($m_{\\text{drug, eq}}$), can be calculated by multiplying the mass of the drug by its sodium chloride equivalent:\n$$m_{\\text{drug, eq}} = m_{\\text{drug}} \\times E_{\\text{drug}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$m_{\\text{drug, eq}} = 0.5 \\text{ g} \\times 0.22 = 0.11 \\text{ g}$$\nThis result signifies that the $0.5$ grams of the drug in $100 \\text{ mL}$ of solution contribute to the tonicity to the same extent as $0.11$ grams of $\\text{NaCl}$ would in the same volume.\n\nThe total required sodium chloride equivalent is $0.9$ grams. A portion of this, $0.11$ grams, is already provided by the drug. The remaining osmotic contribution must be supplied by adding an appropriate mass of $\\text{NaCl}$, which we will denote as $m_{\\text{added, NaCl}}$. The sodium chloride equivalent of $\\text{NaCl}$ itself is, by definition, $1$.\n\nThe total sodium chloride equivalent of the final solution is the sum of the equivalents of its components:\n$$m_{\\text{target, NaCl}} = m_{\\text{drug, eq}} + m_{\\text{added, NaCl}}$$\nWe can now solve for the mass of sodium chloride that must be added:\n$$m_{\\text{added, NaCl}} = m_{\\text{target, NaCl}} - m_{\\text{drug, eq}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated and given values:\n$$m_{\\text{added, NaCl}} = 0.9 \\text{ g} - 0.11 \\text{ g}$$\n$$m_{\\text{added, NaCl}} = 0.79 \\text{ g}$$\n\nThis is the mass of sodium chloride that must be added to $100 \\text{ mL}$ of the drug solution to render it isotonic. The problem requires the answer to be expressed in grams per $100$ milliliters and rounded to two significant figures. The calculated value, $0.79$, already has two significant figures.\n\nThus, the pharmacist must add $0.79$ grams of sodium chloride per $100$ milliliters of the solution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.79}$$", "id": "4729940"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the dynamics of aqueous humor is central to managing glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness.
