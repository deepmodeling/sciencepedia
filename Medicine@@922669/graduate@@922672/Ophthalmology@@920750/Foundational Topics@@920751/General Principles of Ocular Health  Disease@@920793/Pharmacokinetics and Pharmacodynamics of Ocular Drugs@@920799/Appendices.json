It is scientifically grounded in the principles of mass transfer, specifically Fickian diffusion, and represents a standard, well-posed problem in pharmacokinetics. All necessary data are provided, and the problem is free of contradictions, ambiguity, or factual errors.\n\nThe solution will be developed in two parts: first, a general derivation for the permeability of a composite membrane of $N$ layers, and second, the numerical calculation for the specific $3$-layer corneal system.\n\n**Part 1: General Derivation for an N-layer Membrane**\n\nConsider a composite membrane consisting of $N$ planar layers stacked in series along the $x$-axis. Layer $i$ has thickness $L_i$, diffusion coefficient $D_i$, and partition coefficient $K_i$. The transport is one-dimensional and at steady state.\n\nAccording to Fick's first law, the flux $J$ through any layer $i$ is given by:\n$$J = -D_i \\frac{dC_i}{dx}$$\nwhere $C_i(x)$ is the drug concentration within layer $i$. At steady state, the flux $J$ must be constant throughout all layers. Since $D_i$ is also constant within each layer, the concentration gradient $\\frac{dC_i}{dx}$ must be constant. This implies a linear concentration profile across each individual layer.\n\nIntegrating the above equation across layer $i$, from its starting boundary $x_{i-1}$ to its ending boundary $x_i$ (where $L_i = x_i - x_{i-1}$):\n$$J \\int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_i} dx = -D_i \\int_{C_i(x_{i-1})}^{C_i(x_i)} dC_i$$\n$$J L_i = -D_i (C_{i, \\text{end}} - C_{i, \\text{start}})$$\nwhere $C_{i, \\text{start}}$ and $C_{i, \\text{end}}$ are the concentrations at the start and end of layer $i$, respectively. This can be rewritten as:\n$$C_{i, \\text{start}} - C_{i, \\text{end}} = \\frac{J L_i}{D_i}$$\n\nThe problem states that the partition coefficient $K_i$ is defined as the ratio of the equilibrium tissue concentration to the adjacent aqueous concentration. This implies that at an interface between two tissue layers, say layer $i$ and layer $i+1$, there is a concentration discontinuity. If we imagine a \"notional\" aqueous phase of infinitesimal thickness with concentration $C_{\\text{aq},i}$ at the interface, the equilibrium conditions are:\n$$C_{i, \\text{end}} = K_i C_{\\text{aq},i}$$\n$$C_{i+1, \\text{start}} = K_{i+1} C_{\\text{aq},i}$$\nFrom this, we deduce the relationship between the concentrations on either side of the interface:\n$$\\frac{C_{i, \\text{end}}}{K_i} = \\frac{C_{i+1, \\text{start}}}{K_{i+1}}$$\nThis relationship shows that while the concentration $C(x)$ itself is discontinuous at the interfaces, the quantity $C(x)/K(x)$ is continuous. Let us define a new variable, the equivalent aqueous concentration, $C^*(x) = C(x)/K(x)$, where $K(x)$ is the partition coefficient of the layer at position $x$. This variable $C^*(x)$ is continuous throughout the entire composite membrane.\n\nWe can re-express Fick's law in terms of $C^*(x)$. In layer $i$, $C_i(x) = K_i C_i^*(x)$.\n$$J = -D_i \\frac{dC_i}{dx} = -D_i \\frac{d(K_i C_i^*)}{dx} = -D_i K_i \\frac{dC_i^*}{dx}$$\nIntegrating this form across layer $i$:\n$$\\Delta C_i^* = C_{i, \\text{end}}^* - C_{i, \\text{start}}^* = -\\frac{J L_i}{D_i K_i}$$\nThe total drop in the equivalent aqueous concentration across all $N$ layers is the sum of the drops in each layer:\n$$\\Delta C_{\\text{total}}^* = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\Delta C_i^* = -J \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{L_i}{D_i K_i}$$\nThe total drop can also be expressed in terms of the boundary conditions. At the donor side ($x<0$), the aqueous concentration is $C_{\\mathrm{d}}$. At the boundary $x=0$, the equivalent aqueous concentration inside the first layer is $C_{1, \\text{start}}^* = C_1(0)/K_1$. By the equilibrium condition, $C_1(0) = K_1 C_{\\mathrm{d}}$, so $C_{1, \\text{start}}^* = C_{\\mathrm{d}}$.\nAt the receptor side, the aqueous concentration is $0$. At the final boundary, the equivalent aqueous concentration inside the last layer is $C_{N, \\text{end}}^* = C_N(L_{\\text{total}})/K_N$. By equilibrium, $C_N(L_{\\text{total}}) = K_N \\times 0 = 0$, so $C_{N, \\text{end}}^* = 0$.\nThe total drop is therefore $\\Delta C_{\\text{total}}^* = C_{N, \\text{end}}^* - C_{1, \\text{start}}^* = 0 - C_{\\mathrm{d}} = -C_{\\mathrm{d}}$.\n\nEquating the two expressions for the total drop:\n$$-C_{\\mathrm{d}} = -J \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{L_i}{D_i K_i}$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{d}} = J \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{L_i}{D_i K_i}$$\nThe overall permeability coefficient $P$ is defined by the relation $J = P C_{\\mathrm{d}}$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{d}} = (P C_{\\mathrm{d}}) \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{L_i}{D_i K_i}$$\nAssuming $C_{\\mathrm{d}} \\neq 0$, we can divide by $C_{\\mathrm{d}}$ to find the expression for $P$:\n$$P = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{L_i}{D_i K_i} \\right)^{-1}$$\nThis expression shows that the total resistance to permeation, $1/P$, is the sum of the individual resistances of each layer, $R_i = L_i / (D_i K_i)$.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation for the Cornea**\n\nThe cornea is modeled as a $3$-layer system: epithelium (e), stroma (s), and endothelium (en).
