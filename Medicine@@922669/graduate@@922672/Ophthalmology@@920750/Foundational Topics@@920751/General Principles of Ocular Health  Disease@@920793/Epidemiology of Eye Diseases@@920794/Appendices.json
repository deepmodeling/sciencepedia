Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\nThe PPV is defined as the probability of having the disease given a positive test result, which is the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$. We use Bayes' theorem to derive the expression for PPV:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of receiving a positive test result. It can be found using the law of total probability, considering both true positives and false positives:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for PPV gives the full formula:\n$$\\text{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.90)(0.10) + (0.05)(0.90) = 0.090 + 0.045 = 0.135$$\n$$\\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.90)(0.10)}{0.135} = \\frac{0.09}{0.135} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.66666...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\text{PPV} \\approx 0.6667$.\n\n**2. Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\nThe NPV is defined as the probability of not having the disease given a negative test result, which is the conditional probability $P(D^c | T^-)$. Again, we use Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of receiving a negative test result. It can be found using the law of total probability, considering both true negatives and false negatives:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for NPV gives the full formula:\n$$\\text{NPV} = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$P(T^-) = (0.95)(0.90) + (0.10)(0.10) = 0.855 + 0.010 = 0.865$$\n(As a check, $P(T^+) + P(T^-) = 0.135 + 0.865 = 1.000$, as expected.)\n$$\\text{NPV} = \\frac{(0.95)(0.90)}{0.865} = \\frac{0.855}{0.865} \\approx 0.988439...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\text{NPV} \\approx 0.9884$.\n\n**Interpretation of the Results**\nThe Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of approximately $0.6667$ indicates that if a person in this population receives a positive screening result, there is a $66.67\\%$ probability that they actually have AMD. Conversely, this means there is a $33.33\\%$ chance ($1 - 0.6667$) that the positive result is a false positive. Therefore, a positive result from this screening test is not a definitive diagnosis. It suggests a heightened risk, but it must be followed by more accurate, confirmatory diagnostic testing to establish a certain diagnosis. A significant portion of individuals who test positive will not have the disease, which is an important consideration for managing patient anxiety and healthcare resources for follow-up.\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of approximately $0.9884$ is very high. This means that if a person receives a negative screening result, there is a $98.84\\%$ probability that they are truly free of AMD. The probability of having the disease despite a negative result (a false negative) is very low, only $1 - 0.9884 = 0.0116$ or about $1.16\\%$. This high NPV indicates that the screening test is extremely reliable for ruling out AMD. A negative result can provide strong reassurance to the individual and clinician that the disease is not present.\n\nIn summary, for this AMD screening program, the test is much more powerful at confirming the absence of disease than it is at confirming its presence. This is a common finding for screening tests applied in populations where the disease prevalence is relatively low. The program can be confident in its negative results but must be structured to handle a substantial rate of false positives requiring further investigation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.6667  0.9884\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4671658"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying risk and diagnosing cases, a key task in public health is to measure the total impact of a disease on a population's health.

You will synthesize information on incidence, disease severity, and treatment access to calculate the health burden from incident cataract, providing a tangible understanding of how epidemiologists quantify the impact of chronic conditions for policy and planning purposes.

Work from first principles, starting with the definitions of incidence, disability weight, and expected duration of disability, and derive and compute the incident-based YLD generated by the cohort of new cataract cases during the year.\n\nThe population is stratified by age group, with sizes $N_{1} = 300{,}000$ for ages $50$–$69$, $N_{2} = 120{,}000$ for ages $70$–$84$, and $N_{3} = 30{,}000$ for ages $\\geq 85$.

Among incident cases at onset, the distribution of visual impairment severity is: mild with probability $0.25$, moderate with probability $0.55$, and severe with probability $0.20$. The disability weights (dimensionless) for these severity levels are $DW_{\\text{mild}} = 0.012$, $DW_{\\text{moderate}} = 0.031$, and $DW_{\\text{severe}} = 0.184$.\n\nSurgical coverage and waiting times are age-dependent. For ages $50$–$69$, the probability of ultimately receiving cataract surgery is $0.85$ with a mean waiting time of $0.4$ years among those who receive surgery; for ages $70$–$84$, these are $0.80$ and $0.5$ years; for ages $\\geq 85$, these are $0.60$ and $0.6$ years. Assume surgery restores pre-cataract visual function immediately and completely, ending the disability at the time of surgery. Those who do not receive surgery experience persistent visual impairment until death. For those who do not receive surgery, use group-average remaining life expectancy approximations of $24$ years for ages $50$–$69$, $12$ years for ages $70$–$84$, and $5$ years for ages $\\geq 85$. Assume that, conditional on age group, the severity at onset is independent of whether surgery is obtained or not, the disability weight does not change over time until resolution, and mortality while awaiting surgery is negligible relative to the mean waiting time.\n\nUsing only these foundational definitions, derive an expression for the expected incident-based YLD generated in the year by each age stratum and the total population, and compute its numerical value. Express the final YLD in years, and round your final numeric answer to four significant figures.\n\nFinally, based on the epidemiological nature of cataract and chronic visual impairment, argue from first principles whether a prevalence-based YLD (which sums disability weights across all persons currently living with disability) is more appropriate than an incidence-based YLD for chronic visual impairment, and explain why.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and provides a complete and consistent set of data and assumptions for calculating the incident-based Years Lived with Disability (YLD).

The average duration for stratum $i$, $L_i$, is the weighted average of the duration for those who receive surgery (mean waiting time $T_{S,i}$) and those who do not (remaining life expectancy $T_{NS,i}$). The weights are the probability of receiving surgery, $S_i$, and the probability of not receiving surgery, $1-S_i$.\n$$\nL_i = S_i T_{S,i} + (1-S_i) T_{NS,i}\n$$\nFor each stratum:\n- Stratum 1 ($50$–$69$ years): $S_1 = 0.85$, $T_{S,1} = 0.4$ years, $T_{NS,1}=24$ years.\n$$\nL_1 = (0.85 \\times 0.4) + (1-0.85) \\times 24 = 0.34 + 0.15 \\times 24 = 0.34 + 3.6 = 3.94 \\text{ years}\n$$\n- Stratum 2 ($70$–$84$ years): $S_2 = 0.80$, $T_{S,2} = 0.5$ years, $T_{NS,2}=12$ years.\n$$\nL_2 = (0.80 \\times 0.5) + (1-0.80) \\times 12 = 0.4 + 0.20 \\times 12 = 0.4 + 2.4 = 2.8 \\text{ years}\n$$\n- Stratum 3 ($\\geq 85$ years): $S_3 = 0.60$, $T_{S,3} = 0.6$ years, $T_{NS,3}=5$ years.\n$$\nL_3 = (0.60 \\times 0.6) + (1-0.60) \\times 5 = 0.36 + 0.40 \\times 5 = 0.36 + 2.0 = 2.36 \\text{ years}\n$$\n\n**4.

It is a longitudinal, forward-looking measure. Its primary utility is in evaluating the long-term impact of interventions that prevent disease onset (primary prevention) or alter its course post-onset (e.g., improved surgical access). It answers the question: \"What is the lifetime burden caused by this year's new cases?\"\n\n- **Prevalence-based YLD** measures the total disability experienced by all individuals living with the condition during the reference period, regardless of when their condition began. It is a cross-sectional measure, a \"snapshot\" of the burden in the population at a point in time. It is calculated by summing the disability weights of all prevalent cases: $YLD_{\\text{prev}} = P \\times DW$, where $P$ is the number of prevalent cases and $DW$ is their average disability weight.\n\nFor a chronic condition like visually significant cataract, the impairment is long-lasting. At any given time, the population includes a large reservoir of individuals who developed cataracts in previous years and are still living with the associated disability. The **prevalence-based YLD** is therefore more appropriate for quantifying the *total, current burden* of the disease on the population and the healthcare system. It captures the health loss from both new and pre-existing cases within the reference year. This metric is essential for health policy, resource allocation, and planning services (e.g., estimating the number of surgeries needed to clear a backlog). An incidence-based YLD would substantially underestimate this current burden by only accounting for the lifetime disability of the newest cohort of patients, ignoring the ongoing disability of the much larger prevalent population. Therefore, for assessing the present public health problem posed by chronic visual impairment, the prevalence-based approach is more comprehensive and informative.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1782}\n$$", "id": "4671574"}]}
