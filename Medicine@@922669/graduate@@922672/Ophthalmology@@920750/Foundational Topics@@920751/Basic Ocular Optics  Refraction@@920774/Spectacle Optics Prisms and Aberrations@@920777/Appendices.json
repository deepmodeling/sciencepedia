There are no violations of fundamental principles, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\nThe objective is to derive an explicit expression for the largest symmetric allowable vertex-distance error magnitude, $|\\Delta s|$, and then to compute its numerical value.\n\nThe starting point is the set of fundamental principles provided. For an object at infinity, the light rays are parallel, so the vergence incident on the spectacle lens is $V_{\\text{in}} = 0$. According to the thin lens equation, the vergence of light immediately after exiting the lens is:\n$$ V_{\\text{out}} = V_{\\text{in}} + F = 0 + F = F $$\nThis vergence $F$ is at the back surface of the lens. To find the effective vergence at the corneal plane, we must account for the propagation of light over the vertex distance $s$. Using the given formula for vergence transformation in air ($n=1$) over a distance $z=s$, with initial vergence $V_0 = F$:\n$$ V(s) = \\frac{F}{1 - sF} $$\nThis expression gives the effective vergence at the corneal plane as a function of the vertex distance $s$.\n\nThe problem states that at the nominal vertex distance $s_0$, the lens provides the correct vergence $V(s_0)$. If the vertex distance changes to $s = s_0 + \\Delta s$, a new vergence $V(s_0 + \\Delta s)$ is delivered. The magnitude of the error in effective vergence at the corneal plane is $|V(s_0 + \\Delta s) - V(s_0)|$. This error must not exceed a maximum tolerated value, $\\Delta V_{\\max}$.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe task consists of two parts: first, to derive the general condition for preferring the reverse slab-off technique, and second, to calculate the specific corrective prism for the given prescription.\n\n### Part 1: General Condition for Reverse Slab-Off\nLet the prismatic effects induced at the near fixation point for the right and left eyes be $P_{\\text{R}}$ and $P_{\\text{L}}$, respectively. According to the provided formula, with the vertical drop $y$ expressed in centimeters:\n$$P_{\\text{R}} = -y F_{\\text{R}}$$\n$$P_{\\text{L}} = -y F_{\\text{L}}$$\n\nThe goal is to equalize the prism by adding a corrective prism, $P_{\\text{corr}}$, to one lens. The problem specifies that the modified lens, which we will call the \"affected lens,\" is the one that initially produces the smaller magnitude of vertical prism. Let the affected lens be denoted by the subscript $A$ and the unaffected (fellow) lens be denoted by the subscript $U$.\n\nThe condition for a lens to be the affected lens is that its induced prism has a smaller magnitude:\n$$|P_A| < |P_U|$$\nUsing the prism formula, and given that $y > 0$, this is equivalent to:\n$$|-y F_A| < |-y F_U| \\implies y|F_A| < y|F_U| \\implies |F_A| < |F_U|$$\nSo, the affected lens is the one with the smaller magnitude of power.\n\nThe corrective prism $P_{\\text{corr}}$ is added to the affected lens to match the prism of the unaffected lens:\n$$P_A + P_{\\text{corr}} = P_U$$\nSolving for the corrective prism:\n$$P_{\\text{corr}} = P_U - P_A$$\nSubstituting the expressions for prism:\n$$P_{\\text{corr}} = (-y F_U) - (-y F_A) = -y(F_U - F_A)$$\n\nThe problem states that the reverse slab-off technique produces base down (BD) prism. The sign convention defines BD prism as negative. Therefore, the reverse slab-off technique is preferred when the required corrective prism is negative:\n$$P_{\\text{corr}} < 0$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_{\\text{corr}}$:\n$$-y(F_U - F_A) < 0$$\nSince $y > 0$, we can divide the inequality by $-y$ and reverse the inequality sign:\n$$F_U - F_A > 0 \\implies F_U > F_A$$\n\nThus, the general condition under which the reverse slab-off technique is used is that the algebraic power of the unaffected lens ($F_U$) must be greater than the algebraic power of the affected lens ($F_A$). The affected lens is, by definition, the one with the smaller magnitude of power, $|F_A| < |F_U|$. In summary, reverse slab-off is indicated when the lens with the smaller magnitude of power is also the lens with the smaller algebraic power.\n\n### Part 2: Specific Calculation\n\nThe given values are:\n- Right lens power: $F_{\\text{R}} = +1.75$ D.\n- Left lens power: $F_{\\text{L}} = +4.25$ D.\n- Vertical drop: $y = 12$ mm.\n\nFirst, we must convert the vertical drop $y$ from millimeters to centimeters to be consistent with the units in Prentice's rule as given:\n$$y = 12 \\text{ mm} = 1.2 \\text{ cm}$$\n\nNext, we identify the affected lens by comparing the magnitudes of the lens powers:\n$$|F_{\\text{R}}| = |+1.75| = 1.75 \\text{ D}$$\n$$|F_{\\text{L}}| = |+4.25| = 4.25 \\text{ D}$$\nSince $|F_{\\text{R}}| < |F_{\\text{L}}|$, the right lens is the affected lens ($A=R$) and the left lens is the unaffected lens ($U=L$).\n\nNow, we calculate the initial prismatic effect at the near fixation point for each lens using the formula $P = -yF$:\n$$P_{\\text{R}} = -(1.2 \\text{ cm}) \\times (+1.75 \\text{ D}) = -2.1 \\text{ prism diopters}$$\n$$P_{\\text{L}} = -(1.2 \\text{ cm}) \\times (+4.25 \\text{ D}) = -5.1 \\text{ prism diopters}$$\nThe negative sign indicates base down (BD) prism for both lenses, as expected for positive powers. The right lens induces $2.1 \\Delta$ BD, and the left lens induces $5.1 \\Delta$ BD.\n\nThe required corrective prism, $P_{\\text{corr}}$, is added to the affected lens (right lens) to equalize its prismatic effect with the unaffected lens (left lens):\n$$P_{\\text{corr}} = P_L - P_R$$\n$$P_{\\text{corr}} = (-5.1 \\Delta) - (-2.1 \\Delta) = -5.1 \\Delta + 2.1 \\Delta = -3.0 \\Delta$$\n\nThe corrective prism required is $-3.0$ prism diopters. The negative sign signifies base down prism. This is consistent with our general condition, as $F_U = F_L = +4.25$ is algebraically greater than $F_A = F_R = +1.75$, indicating a reverse slab-off (BD prism) is needed.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $-3.0$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $-3.000$.\n\nThe required modification is to introduce $3.000$ prism diopters base down to the right lens. As a signed number, this is $-3.000$ prism diopters.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-3.000}\n$$", "id": "4726649"}, {"introduction": "The optimal performance of a spectacle lens is sensitive not only to its placement along the optical axis but also to its tilt within the frame.

Such standard approximations exist, making the problem self-contained under this interpretation. Therefore, the problem is not underspecified. The constraints are not contradictory.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires us to find the maximum allowable absolute pantoscopic tilt, $|\\tau|$, for a spectacle lens such that the magnitude of the obliquely induced astigmatic error remains below $0.50 \\ \\mathrm{D}$ over a specified range of vertical gaze angles.\n\nFirst, we determine the powers of the sphero-cylindrical lens in its principal meridians. The prescription is given as $S=-2.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$ and $C=-4.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$ at axis $180^{\\circ}$.\nThe power in the meridian of the cylinder axis ($180^{\\circ}$, horizontal) is the spherical power, $S$.\n$$P_{180} = S = -2.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$$\nThe power in the meridian perpendicular to the axis ($90^{\\circ}$, vertical) is the sum of the spherical and cylindrical powers, $S+C$.\n$$P_{90} = S + C = -2.00 \\ \\mathrm{D} + (-4.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}) = -6.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$$\n\nThe lens is subjected to a pantoscopic tilt, $\\tau$, which is a rotation about the horizontal ($180^{\\circ}$) axis. The eye also rotates vertically by a gaze angle, $\\varphi$. The total angle of incidence, $\\theta$, between the line of sight and the lens normal lies in the vertical plane. Assuming small angles and a consistent sign convention (e.g., positive for upward gaze and downward tilt), the total angle of incidence is the sum of the pantoscopic tilt and the gaze angle.\n$$\\theta(\\varphi, \\tau) = \\varphi + \\tau$$\n\nWe must model the obliquely induced astigmatism. For a thin lens tilted by an angle $\\theta$ about a principal meridian, a common paraxial approximation for the induced astigmatism, which is independent of the lens refractive index, is derived from the change in the tangential and sagittal powers.\nThe tilt occurs about the horizontal ($180^{\\circ}$) axis. Therefore, the horizontal meridian is the sagittal meridian for the tilt, and the vertical ($90^{\\circ}$) meridian is the tangential meridian.\nThe power of the lens in the sagittal meridian is $P_s = P_{180} = -2.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$.\nThe power of the lens in the tangential meridian is $P_t = P_{90} = -6.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$.\n\nIn the paraxial model, the sagittal power is approximately unchanged by the tilt, while the tangential power is modified. The new powers, $P'_s$ and $P'_t$, are:\n$$P'_s \\approx P_s$$\n$$P'_t \\approx \\frac{P_t}{\\cos^2\\theta}$$\nThe original astigmatism of the lens is $A = P_t - P_s$. The new astigmatism after tilting is $A' = P'_t - P'_s$. The obliquely induced astigmatic error, $\\Delta C_{induced}$, is the difference between the new and original astigmatism:\n$$\\Delta C_{induced} = A' - A = \\left(\\frac{P_t}{\\cos^2\\theta} - P_s\\right) - (P_t - P_s)$$\n$$\\Delta C_{induced} = \\frac{P_t}{\\cos^2\\theta} - P_t = P_t \\left( \\frac{1}{\\cos^2\\theta} - 1 \\right) = P_t (\\sec^2\\theta - 1)$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sec^2\\theta - 1 = \\tan^2\\theta$, we get:\n$$\\Delta C_{induced}(\\theta) = P_t \\tan^2\\theta$$\nSubstituting the value of the tangential power, $P_t = P_{90} = -6.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$:\n$$\\Delta C_{induced}(\\theta) = -6.00 \\tan^2\\theta$$\n\nThe problem requires the magnitude of this error to be strictly less than $0.50 \\ \\mathrm{D}$ for all gaze angles $\\varphi$ in the range $[-12^{\\circ}, +12^{\\circ}]$.\n$$|\\Delta C_{induced}| < 0.50 \\ \\mathrm{D}$$\n$$|-6.00 \\tan^2(\\varphi+\\tau)| < 0.50$$\n$$6.00 \\tan^2(\\varphi+\\tau) < 0.50$$\nTo satisfy this condition for the entire range of $\\varphi$, we must ensure it holds for the value of $\\varphi$ that maximizes the term $\\tan^2(\\varphi+\\tau)$. The function $\\tan^2(x)$ is an even function ($f(x) = f(-x)$) and increases as the magnitude of its argument, $|x|$, increases (for $|x| < 90^{\\circ}$). Therefore, we must find the maximum value of $|\\varphi+\\tau|$ for $\\varphi \\in [-12^{\\circ}, +12^{\\circ}]$.\nThe maximum value of $|\\varphi+\\tau|$ occurs at one of the endpoints of the $\\varphi$ interval:\n$$\\max_{\\varphi \\in [-12^{\\circ},+12^{\\circ}]} |\\varphi+\\tau| = \\max(|-12^{\\circ}+\\tau|, |12^{\\circ}+\\tau|) = 12^{\\circ} + |\\tau|$$\nThe condition on the maximum error thus becomes:\n$$6.00 \\tan^2(12^{\\circ} + |\\tau|) < 0.50$$\nWe now solve for the largest allowable value of $|\\tau|$.\n$$\\tan^2(12^{\\circ} + |\\tau|) < \\frac{0.50}{6.00} = \\frac{1}{12}$$\nTaking the square root of both sides (since the argument of tan will be in the first quadrant, its value is positive):\n$$\\tan(12^{\\circ} + |\\tau|) < \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{12}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{12}} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}$$\nNow, we take the inverse tangent of both sides:\n$$12^{\\circ} + |\\tau| < \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$$\n$$|\\tau| < \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\right) - 12^{\\circ}$$\nNow we compute the numerical value.\n$$\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\approx \\arctan(0.288675...) \\approx 16.1021^{\\circ}$$\nSubstituting this value back into the inequality for $|\\tau|$:\n$$|\\tau| < 16.1021^{\\circ} - 12^{\\circ}$$\n$$|\\tau| < 4.1021^{\\circ}$$\nThe problem asks for the largest allowable absolute pantoscopic tilt, which is the supremum of the set of allowed values for $|\\tau|$. We round this value to three significant figures as requested.\n$$|\\tau|_{max} \\approx 4.10^{\\circ}$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4.10}\n$$", "id": "4726646"}]}
