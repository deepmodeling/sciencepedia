During light adaptation, phototransduction activates phosphodiesterase, decreasing the intracellular free cGMP concentration and thereby reducing the macroscopic outer segment current. Assume the following foundational facts: (i) at a fixed membrane potential with constant single-channel conductance, macroscopic current through a population of identical channels is proportional to the fraction of channels that are open; (ii) the steady-state open probability of the CNG channels follows a cooperative binding relation parameterized by a Hill coefficient and a half-activation concentration; and (iii) all channels contribute equally and independently.\n\nLet the open probability be described by a Hill relation with Hill coefficient $n$ and half-activation concentration $K$ (in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$).
