The problem statement provides all necessary information and relies on established principles of geometric optics. The given values for the refractive indices of air ($n_1 = 1.000$) and cornea ($n_2 = 1.376$) are standard and physically realistic. The approximation of the cornea as a planar interface over a small region is a valid and common simplification in optical analysis. The task is to derive Snell's law from first principles and then apply it to a specific scenario, which is a standard and well-defined physics problem. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe first part of the task is to derive the law of refraction from Fermat’s principle of stationary optical path length. Let us consider a planar interface at $y=0$ separating two homogeneous, isotropic media. Medium 1, for $y0$, has a refractive index $n_1$. Medium 2, for $y0$, has a refractive index $n_2$. A light ray travels from a point $A=(x_A, y_A)$ in medium 1 to a point $B=(x_B, y_B)$ in medium 2, crossing the interface at an arbitrary point $P=(x, 0)$.\n\nThe optical path length (OPL), denoted by $L$, is the integral of the refractive index along the geometric path. For a path consisting of two straight-line segments in homogeneous media, the OPL is given by:\n$$ L = n_1 \\times (\\text{distance from A to P}) + n_2 \\times (\\text{distance from P to B}) $$\nUsing the distance formula in Cartesian coordinates, we can express the OPL as a function of the position $x$ where the ray crosses the interface:\n$$ L(x) = n_1 \\sqrt{(x - x_A)^2 + (y_A - 0)^2} + n_2 \\sqrt{(x_B - x)^2 + (y_B - 0)^2} $$\n$$ L(x) = n_1 \\sqrt{(x - x_A)^2 + y_A^2} + n_2 \\sqrt{(x_B - x)^2 + y_B^2} $$\nFermat's principle states that the actual path taken by light makes the optical path length stationary. To find the path that extremizes $L(x)$, we must set its derivative with respect to $x$ equal to zero: $\\frac{dL(x)}{dx} = 0$.\n\nLet's compute the derivative of $L(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{dL}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ n_1 \\left((x - x_A)^2 + y_A^2\\right)^{1/2} \\right] + \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ n_2 \\left((x_B - x)^2 + y_B^2\\right)^{1/2} \\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{dL}{dx} = n_1 \\frac{2(x - x_A)}{2\\sqrt{(x - x_A)^2 + y_A^2}} + n_2 \\frac{2(x_B - x)(-1)}{2\\sqrt{(x_B - x)^2 + y_B^2}} $$\n$$ \\frac{dL}{dx} = n_1 \\frac{x - x_A}{\\sqrt{(x - x_A)^2 + y_A^2}} - n_2 \\frac{x_B - x}{\\sqrt{(x_B - x)^2 + y_B^2}} $$\nThe angles of incidence, $\\theta_1$, and refraction, $\\theta_2$, are defined with respect to the normal to the surface (the $y$-axis). From the geometry of the path segments, we can identify the trigonometric sines of these angles:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta_1) = \\frac{|x - x_A|}{\\sqrt{(x - x_A)^2 + y_A^2}} $$\n$$ \\sin(\\theta_2) = \\frac{|x_B - x|}{\\sqrt{(x_B - x)^2 + y_B^2}} $$\nFor a typical configuration where the ray propagates in the positive x-direction, we can set $x_A=0$ and assume $x0$ and $x_B  x$, so that $|x-x_A|=x$ and $|x_B-x|=x_B-x$. The derivative expression becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dL}{dx} = n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) - n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2) $$\nApplying Fermat's principle, $\\frac{dL}{dx} = 0$:\n$$ n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) - n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2) = 0 $$\nThis yields Snell's Law of refraction:\n$$ n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2) $$\nThis result, derived from the stationarity of the optical path length, is fundamentally consistent with the requirement of phase continuity at the interface, which is the basis of the Huygens-Fresnel principle. The condition that wavefronts remain continuous across the boundary also leads directly to Snell's law.\n\nThe second part of the task is to apply this relationship to the given parameters.\nWe are given:\nThe refractive index of the first medium (air): $n_1 = 1.000$.\nThe refractive index of the second medium (cornea): $n_2 = 1.376$.\nThe angle of incidence in air: $\\theta_1 = 30^\\circ$.\n\nWe need to calculate the angle of refraction $\\theta_2$ in the cornea.

Round your result to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the effective power relation for relocating a spectacle lens to the corneal plane and the subsequent calculation of the equivalent contact lens power for a myopic correction. The solution will proceed by analyzing the vergence of light, first for the spectacle lens and then for the contact lens, and equating the required conditions at the corneal plane.\n\nThe fundamental principle for a thin refracting element is the Gaussian imaging relation, given as:\n$$ \\frac{n'}{s'} - \\frac{n}{s} = F $$\nwhere $n$ and $n'$ are the refractive indices of the object and image spaces, respectively, $s$ is the object distance, $s'$ is the image distance, and $F$ is the power of the lens. In this problem, the medium is air, so we can set $n = n' = 1$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{s'} - \\frac{1}{s} = F $$\nThis equation can be expressed in terms of vergence. The object vergence is $V = 1/s$ and the image vergence is $V' = 1/s'$. The relation becomes $V' - V = F$, or $V' = V + F$.\n\nFirst, consider the spectacle lens. The power of the spectacle lens is given as $F_{sp} = -12.00$ diopters (D). The object of regard is at optical infinity, which means the object distance is $s = -\\infty$. The vergence of light rays incident on the spectacle lens is therefore:\n$$ V_{in} = \\frac{1}{s} = \\frac{1}{-\\infty} = 0 \\, \\text{D} $$\nThe vergence of the light immediately after exiting the spectacle lens, $V_{out, sp}$, is:\n$$ V_{out, sp} = V_{in} + F_{sp} = 0 + F_{sp} = F_{sp} $$\n\nThis light then propagates from the spectacle plane to the corneal plane, which is a distance $d = 12\\,\\text{mm}$ away. The change in vergence during propagation through a distance $d$ in a medium of refractive index $n$ is given by the formula:\n$$ V_2 = \\frac{V_1}{1 - (d/n)V_1} $$\nwhere $V_1$ is the initial vergence and $V_2$ is the final vergence. In our case, the initial vergence is $V_1 = V_{out, sp} = F_{sp}$, the medium is air ($n=1$), and the distance is $d$. The vergence of the light as it becomes incident on the cornea, which we denote as $V_{cornea}$, is:\n$$ V_{cornea} = \\frac{F_{sp}}{1 - d \\cdot F_{sp}} $$\nThis is the pre-corneal vergence that the spectacle lens provides.\n\nNext, consider the contact lens. The contact lens is placed directly on the cornea, so its distance from the corneal plane is $d_{cl} = 0$. Let its power be $F_{cl}$. For the contact lens to provide the same correction, it must also correctly focus light from an object at infinity. The vergence of light incident on the contact lens is again $V_{in, cl} = 0$. The vergence of light immediately exiting the contact lens is:\n$$ V_{out, cl} = V_{in, cl} + F_{cl} = 0 + F_{cl} = F_{cl} $$\nSince the contact lens is at the corneal plane ($d_{cl}=0$), the pre-corneal vergence it produces is simply the vergence immediately after the lens.\n$$ V_{cl, at\\_cornea} = F_{cl} $$\n\nThe problem requires that the contact lens produces the same pre-corneal vergence as the spectacle lens. Therefore, we must equate the two expressions for the vergence at the cornea:\n$$ V_{cl, at\\_cornea} = V_{cornea} $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions, we get:\n$$ F_{cl} = \\frac{F_{sp}}{1 - d \\cdot F_{sp}} $$\nThis is the required effective power relation, also known as the vertex distance compensation formula.\n\nNow, we can compute the numerical value for the equivalent contact lens power.\nThe given values are:\nSpectacle power, $F_{sp} = -12.00 \\, \\text{D}$.\nVertex distance, $d = 12\\,\\text{mm}$.\nTo use these values in the formula, the distance $d$ must be converted from millimeters to meters, because $1\\,\\text{D} = 1\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$.\n$$ d = 12\\,\\text{mm} = 0.012\\,\\text{m} $$\nSubstituting the values into the derived relation:\n$$ F_{cl} = \\frac{-12.00}{1 - (0.012) \\times (-12.00)} $$\n$$ F_{cl} = \\frac{-12.00}{1 + (0.012 \\times 12.00)} $$\n$$ F_{cl} = \\frac{-12.00}{1 + 0.144} $$\n$$ F_{cl} = \\frac{-12.00}{1.144} $$\nCalculating the value:\n$$ F_{cl} \\approx -10.4895104895... \\, \\text{D} $$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to three significant figures.

The vergence of these rays just before striking the cornea is zero. Let's denote this as $L_0$.\n    $$ L_0 = 0 $$\n\n2.  **Refraction at the Cornea**: The cornea acts as a thin lens with power $K$. According to the thin lens formula, the vergence $L_1$ immediately after the cornea is:\n    $$ L_1 = L_0 + K = 0 + K = K $$\n    This vergence $L_1$ is at the corneal plane (vertex).\n\n3.  **Propagation from Cornea to IOL**: The light then propagates through the intraocular medium (refractive index $n$) over a distance equal to the Effective Lens Position, $t = \\mathrm{ELP}$.
