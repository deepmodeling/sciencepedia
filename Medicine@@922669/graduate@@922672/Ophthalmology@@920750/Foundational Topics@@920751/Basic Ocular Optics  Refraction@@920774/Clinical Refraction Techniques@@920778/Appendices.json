It describes a standard clinical scenario in ophthalmology (static retinoscopy) using established optical principles and realistic parameters. The problem is solvable as stated.\n\nThe solution proceeds from the first principles of vergence and the far point concept. In ocular optics, the far point of an eye is the point in space that is conjugate to the retina when accommodation is fully relaxed. The refractive error, denoted by $K$, is the dioptric power required at the corneal plane to move the far point to infinity. It is related to the far point distance, $fp$, from the cornea by the formula $K = -\\frac{1}{fp}$. The vergence of light from the far point as it reaches the cornea is therefore $U_{fp} = \\frac{1}{fp} = -K$.\n\nStatic retinoscopy is a technique to objectively determine refractive error. The procedure aims to find the lens power that makes the patient's far point conjugate to the retinoscope's peephole a procedure known as finding \"neutrality\". At neutrality, the light rays emerging from the patient's eye, which appear to originate from their far point, are focused exactly at the retinoscopist's observation plane.\n\nLet $L_{gross}$ be the power of the trial lens that achieves neutrality. In this problem, $L_{gross} = +2.25~\\mathrm{D}$. This lens is placed at the patient's corneal plane.\nLet $d$ be the working distance from the clinician's retinoscope to the patient's cornea, given as $d = 0.67~\\mathrm{m}$.\nWe can analyze the system using the vergence formula for a thin lens, $U + P = V$, where $U$ is the object vergence, $P$ is the lens power, and $V$ is the image vergence.\n\nFor the system composed of the eye and the trial lens, the light emerging from the retina appears to come from the eye's far point, $fp$. This far point acts as the object for the trial lens. The object vergence at the trial lens is $U = \\frac{1}{fp}$. As established, this vergence is equal to the negative of the refractive error, so $U = -K$.\n\nThe power of the trial lens is $P = L_{gross}$. The vergence of the light after passing through the trial lens is $V = U + P = -K + L_{gross}$.\n\nAt neutrality, this emergent light is focused at the retinoscope's peephole, a distance $d$ from the lens. Thus, the image is formed at a distance $v = d$. The image vergence is $V = \\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{1}{d}$.\n\nBy equating the two expressions for the image vergence $V$, we obtain the central equation for retinoscopy:\n$$ -K + L_{gross} = \\frac{1}{d} $$\nOur first goal is to find the net refractive error, $K$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $K$:\n$$ K = L_{gross} - \\frac{1}{d} $$\nThis equation shows that the patient's true refractive error ($K$) is the gross retinoscopy finding ($L_{gross}$) minus a correction factor for the working distance vergence, which we can call $W = \\frac{1}{d}$.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$L_{gross} = +2.25~\\mathrm{D}$\n$d = 0.67~\\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the working distance vergence $W$:\n$$ W = \\frac{1}{0.67~\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 1.492537~\\mathrm{D} $$\nNow, we calculate the net refractive error $K$:\n$$ K = 2.25~\\mathrm{D} - \\frac{1}{0.67}~\\mathrm{D} \\approx 2.25~\\mathrm{D} - 1.492537~\\mathrm{D} \\approx 0.757463~\\mathrm{D} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as required, the net refractive error is:\n$$ K \\approx +0.757~\\mathrm{D} $$\nThe positive sign indicates that the patient is hyperopic. This result is consistent with the observation of \"with\" motion with an initial $+1.50~\\mathrm{D}$ lens. The total power required for neutrality is $+2.25~\\mathrm{D}$. Since $+1.50~\\mathrm{D}$ is less than this value, the system was under-plussed, which correctly corresponds to \"with\" motion.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the additional lens power, $\\Delta L$, required to reach neutrality from the initial trial lens power, $L_{initial} = +1.50~\\mathrm{D}$.\nThis is the difference between the lens power at neutrality, $L_{gross}$, and the initial lens power, $L_{initial}$:\n$$ \\Delta L = L_{gross} - L_{initial} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\Delta L = 2.25~\\mathrm{D} - 1.50~\\mathrm{D} = 0.75~\\mathrm{D} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the additional power is:\n$$ \\Delta L = +0.750~\\mathrm{D} $$\nThe two required values are the net refractive error, $K \\approx +0.757~\\mathrm{D}$, and the additional lens power, $\\Delta L = +0.750~\\mathrm{D}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.757  0.750 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4661564"}, {"introduction": "A spectacle prescription's power is not absolute; its true effect on the eye depends critically on its distance from the cornea.

This involves a three-part process: transposing the initial prescription, calculating the vergence change over the vertex distance for each principal meridian, and re-compiling the prescription at the new reference plane. The analysis will be conducted using the principles of paraxial Gaussian optics.\n\nFirst, we define the core concepts. A spherocylindrical lens has two principal meridians, which are orthogonal axes with the maximum and minimum refractive powers. A spectacle prescription is typically written in the form $S/C \\times A$, where $S$ is the spherical power, $C$ is the cylindrical power, and $A$ is the axis of the cylinder in degrees.\n\nThe vergence, $V$, of light at a point on the optical axis is a measure of the curvature of its wavefront. It is defined as $V = n/d$, where $n$ is the refractive index of the medium and $d$ is the distance from the point to the corresponding focal point. For light propagating in air ($n \\approx 1$), $V = 1/d$. The power of a thin lens, $P$, in diopters (D), is the reciprocal of its focal length in meters, $P=1/f$. For an object at infinity, the incident light consists of plane waves with zero vergence ($V_{in} = 0$). After passing through a thin lens of power $P$, the vergence of the light immediately becomes $V_{out} = P$.\n\nWhen light propagates a distance $d$ in a medium of refractive index $n$ from a plane with vergence $V_1$ to a new plane with vergence $V_2$, the relationship is given by the vergence translation formula:\n$$\nV_2 = \\frac{V_1}{1 - \\frac{d}{n}V_1}\n$$\nIn this problem, the medium is air ($n=1$), and the distance is the vertex distance, which we define as the distance $v$ from the back surface of the spectacle lens to the anterior surface of the cornea. Thus, the formula becomes:\n$$\nV_{\\text{cornea}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{spectacle}}}{1 - v V_{\\text{spectacle}}}\n$$\nThis equation relates the power required at the spectacle plane, $P_s = V_{\\text{spectacle}}$, to the effective power required at the corneal plane, $P_c = V_{\\text{cornea}}$, to correct the eye's refractive error for an object at infinity.\n$$\nP_c = \\frac{P_s}{1 - v P_s}\n$$\n\n**1.

The power along the orthogonal meridian ($90^\\circ + 90^\\circ = 180^\\circ$) is the sum of the sphere and cylinder powers.\nLet $P_{s,90}$ and $P_{s,180}$ be the powers of the lens along the $90^\\circ$ and $180^\\circ$ meridians, respectively.\nPrincipal power along the axis meridian ($90^\\circ$):\n$$\nP_{s,90} = S = -3.00~\\mathrm{D}\n$$\nPrincipal power along the orthogonal meridian ($180^\\circ$):\n$$\nP_{s,180} = S + C = -3.00~\\mathrm{D} + 2.00~\\mathrm{D} = -1.00~\\mathrm{D}\n$$\nThe principal powers of the spectacle lens are therefore $-3.00~\\mathrm{D}$ at $90^\\circ$ and $-1.00~\\mathrm{D}$ at $180^\\circ$.\n\nTo transpose this into minus-cylinder notation ($S'/C' \\times A'$), we must represent the same lens physics. In minus-cylinder notation, the axis $A'$ corresponds to the meridian of maximum power (least negative or most positive). The power along this axis is the new sphere power $S'$.\nThe maximum power is $-1.00~\\mathrm{D}$, which occurs along the $180^\\circ$ meridian.\nThus, the new axis is $A' = 180^\\circ$.\nThe new sphere power is the power along this meridian: $S' = P_{s,180} = -1.00~\\mathrm{D}$.\n\nThe new cylinder power $C'$ is the difference in power between the two principal meridians.

The vertex distance is given as $v = 12~\\mathrm{mm} = 0.012~\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe spectacle-plane powers are $P_{s,90} = -3.00~\\mathrm{D}$ and $P_{s,180} = -1.00~\\mathrm{D}$.\n\nFor the $90^\\circ$ meridian:\nThe required corneal-plane power, $P_{c,90}$, is:\n$$\nP_{c,90} = \\frac{P_{s,90}}{1 - v P_{s,90}} = \\frac{-3.00}{1 - (0.012)(-3.00)} = \\frac{-3.00}{1 + 0.036} = \\frac{-3.00}{1.036} \\approx -2.8957528958~\\mathrm{D}\n$$\n\nFor the $180^\\circ$ meridian:\nThe required corneal-plane power, $P_{c,180}$, is:\n$$\nP_{c,180} = \\frac{P_{s,180}}{1 - v P_{s,180}} = \\frac{-1.00}{1 - (0.012)(-1.00)} = \\frac{-1.00}{1 + 0.012} = \\frac{-1.00}{1.012} \\approx -0.9881422925~\\mathrm{D}\n$$\nThese are the effective powers required at the cornea along each principal meridian.\n\n**3.

The concepts presented, namely the power-vector representation of refractive error, are standard and fundamental in modern ophthalmology and optometry. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe core of the problem requires an explanation of why averaging refractive errors in the power-vector space spanned by $\\left(M,J_{0},J_{45}\\right)$ is superior to averaging in the conventional sphero-cylindrical notation $\\left(S,C,\\text{axis}\\right)$, followed by a calculation of the mean refraction for the given cohort.\n\n**Part 1: Conceptual Explanation**\n\nThe first principle is that refractive power, for thin lenses in close proximity as is the case in clinical refraction, is an additive quantity. This suggests that statistical operations like averaging should be straightforward. However, the standard clinical notation for refractive error, $\\left(S, C, \\alpha\\right)$, where $S$ is the spherical power, $C$ is the cylindrical power, and $\\alpha$ is the cylinder axis, presents a significant challenge for such operations.\n\nThe primary difficulty lies with the axis, $\\alpha$. The axis is a cyclical quantity defined on the interval from $1^{\\circ}$ to $180^{\\circ}$, where an axis of $1^{\\circ}$ is physically adjacent to an axis of $180^{\\circ}$. This property, known as modulo 180 arithmetic, renders the standard arithmetic mean invalid for averaging axes. For example, consider two eyes with simple astigmatism: one with prescription $/ -1.00 \\times 180^{\\circ}$ and another with $/ -1.00 \\times 90^{\\circ}$. The arithmetic mean of the axes is $\\frac{180 + 90}{2} = 135^{\\circ}$. This result is ophthalmologically meaningless. These two astigmatic corrections are equal in magnitude but orthogonal in orientation. Their combination should result in a net spherical power, cancelling out the astigmatism entirely, not producing an intermediate oblique astigmatism at $135^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe power-vector representation $\\left(M, J_{0}, J_{45}\\right)$ resolves this issue by transforming the refractive error into a three-dimensional Euclidean vector space, $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, where standard vector algebra applies. This representation is derived from a Fourier decomposition of the dioptric power of the lens as a function of the meridian angle. The components are defined from the sphero-cylindrical parameters $\\left(S, C, \\alpha\\right)$ as follows:\n\n1.  $M = S + \\frac{C}{2}$: This is the mean spherical equivalent, representing the average refractive power over all meridians. It is a scalar quantity, corresponding to the zeroth-order Fourier term.\n2.  $J_{0} = -\\frac{C}{2} \\cos(2\\alpha)$: This is the power of a Jackson cross-cylinder (JCC) with axes at $90^{\\circ}$ and $180^{\\circ}$. It quantifies the amount of \"with-the-rule\" (when $J_0 > 0$) or \"against-the-rule\" (when $J_0  0$) astigmatism.\n3.  $J_{45} = -\\frac{C}{2} \\sin(2\\alpha)$: This is the power of a JCC with axes at $45^{\\circ}$ and $135^{\\circ}$. It quantifies the amount of oblique astigmatism.\n\nThe crucial element of this transformation is the use of twice the axis angle, $2\\alpha$. This operation maps the $180^{\\circ}$ physical space of the cylinder axis, with its problematic circularity, onto a complete $360^{\\circ}$ mathematical space. The astigmatism is now represented by a vector $\\left(J_{0}, J_{45}\\right)$ in a two-dimensional Cartesian plane. This linearizes the problem of axis representation.\n\nBecause the triplet $\\left(M, J_{0}, J_{45}\\right)$ defines a vector in a linear space, operations such as addition and scalar multiplication are well-defined and physically meaningful. The average of a cohort of $N$ refractive errors, represented by vectors $\\mathbf{v}_i = \\left(M_i, J_{0,i}, J_{45,i}\\right)$, is simply the component-wise arithmetic mean:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_{\\text{mean}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} M_i, \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} J_{0,i}, \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} J_{45,i} \\right) $$\nThis operation is both statistically and physically robust. To illustrate, Eye A $\\left(-3.00, 0.50, 0.00\\right)$ has with-the-rule astigmatism (axis $180^{\\circ}$) and Eye B $\\left(-3.00, -0.50, 0.00\\right)$ has against-the-rule astigmatism (axis $90^{\\circ}$), both with the same magnitude of cylinder. The vector average of their astigmatic components is $\\left(\\frac{0.50 - 0.50}{2}, \\frac{0.00 + 0.00}{2}\\right) = \\left(0.00, 0.00\\right)$, correctly indicating that the net astigmatism is zero, which aligns with the physical reality of combining two equal and orthogonal cylinders.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Cohort Mean Refraction**\n\nThe cohort consists of $N=3$ eyes with the following power-vector coordinates (in diopters):\n-   Eye A: $\\mathbf{v}_A = \\left(-3.00, 0.50, 0.00\\right)$\n-   Eye B: $\\mathbf{v}_B = \\left(-3.00, -0.50, 0.00\\right)$\n-   Eye C: $\\mathbf{v}_C = \\left(-3.00, 0.00, 0.50\\right)$\n\nThe cohort mean refraction, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{mean}} = \\left(M_{\\text{mean}}, J_{0,\\text{mean}}, J_{45,\\text{mean}}\\right)$, is the Euclidean vector average of these three points.
