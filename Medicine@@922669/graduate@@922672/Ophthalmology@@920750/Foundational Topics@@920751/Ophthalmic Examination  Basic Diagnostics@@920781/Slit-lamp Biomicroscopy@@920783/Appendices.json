A unique and meaningful solution is attainable.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of subjective claims.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** All necessary data ($\\lambda$, $\\mathrm{NA}$) for the calculation are provided. The mention of the pupil diameter is relevant for the interpretation part of the question. The refractive index $n=1.00$ for air is consistent with the standard context of slit-lamp use. There are no contradictions.\n5.  **Realism:** The given parameters ($\\mathrm{NA}=0.10$, $\\lambda=550\\,\\text{nm}$, pupil diameter of $3\\,\\text{mm}$) are all within realistic ranges for clinical ophthalmology.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of Lateral Resolution\n\nThe task is to derive the lateral diffraction-limited resolution, $R$, according to the Rayleigh criterion.\n\nThe Rayleigh criterion states that two point sources are just resolvable if the center of the diffraction pattern (Airy disk) of one source is directly over the first minimum of the diffraction pattern of the other. The resolution, $R$, is therefore the radius of the Airy disk as measured in the object plane.\n\nLet us start from image space and work back to object space. In the image space, a point object is imaged as an Airy disk. The angular position, $\\theta_i$, of the first minimum of the Airy pattern produced by a circular aperture is given by:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta_i) = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda_i}{D} $$\nwhere $\\lambda_i$ is the wavelength of light in the image space and $D$ is the diameter of the exit pupil of the objective lens.\n\nThe radius of the central Airy disk in the image plane, $R_i$, is related to this angle and the image-side focal length, $f_i$:\n$$ R_i = f_i \\tan(\\theta_i) $$\nFor small angles typical in microscopy, we can use the approximation $\\tan(\\theta_i) \\approx \\sin(\\theta_i)$, so:\n$$ R_i \\approx f_i \\sin(\\theta_i) = 1.22 \\frac{f_i \\lambda_i}{D} $$\nThe exit pupil diameter $D$ is related to the image-side convergence half-angle, $\\alpha_i$, by $D = 2 f_i \\tan(\\alpha_i)$. Substituting this into the expression for $R_i$:\n$$ R_i \\approx \\frac{1.22 f_i \\lambda_i}{2 f_i \\tan(\\alpha_i)} = \\frac{0.61 \\lambda_i}{\\tan(\\alpha_i)} $$\nAgain, for small angles, $\\tan(\\alpha_i) \\approx \\sin(\\alpha_i)$, which gives:\n$$ R_i \\approx \\frac{0.61 \\lambda_i}{\\sin(\\alpha_i)} $$\nTo find the resolution $R$ in the object space, we use the Abbe sine condition, which relates object-space quantities (denoted by no subscript) to image-space quantities (subscript $i$):\n$$ n R \\sin(\\alpha) = n_i R_i \\sin(\\alpha_i) $$\nHere, $n$ is the refractive index of the object-space medium, $\\alpha$ is the collection half-angle of the objective in object space, $n_i$ is the refractive index of the image space, and $R$ is the resolution (object separation).\n\nAssuming the image space is air, we have $n_i = 1$ and the wavelength $\\lambda_i$ is the vacuum wavelength $\\lambda$. Substituting our expression for $R_i$:\n$$ n R \\sin(\\alpha) = (1) \\left( \\frac{0.61 \\lambda}{\\sin(\\alpha_i)} \\right) \\sin(\\alpha_i) $$\n$$ n R \\sin(\\alpha) = 0.61 \\lambda $$\nSolving for the resolution $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{0.61 \\lambda}{n \\sin(\\alpha)} $$\nThe numerical aperture ($\\mathrm{NA}$) of the objective is defined as $\\mathrm{NA} = n \\sin(\\alpha)$. Substituting this definition into the equation for $R$, we arrive at the final expression for the lateral resolution:\n$$ R = \\frac{0.61 \\lambda}{\\mathrm{NA}} $$\n\n### Step 3: Numerical Evaluation of Resolution\n\nNext, I will evaluate this resolution for the given parameters.\n\n**Given:**\n- Vacuum wavelength: $\\lambda = 550\\,\\text{nm} = 550 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}$\n- Numerical Aperture: $\\mathrm{NA} = 0.10$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ R = \\frac{0.61 \\times (550 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m})}{0.10} $$\n$$ R = 0.61 \\times (5500 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}) $$\n$$ R = 3355 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m} $$\n$$ R = 3.355 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m} $$\nThe problem asks for the result to be expressed in micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$). Since $1\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}$:\n$$ R = 3.355\\,\\mu\\text{m} $$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, the resolution is:\n$$ R \\approx 3.36\\,\\mu\\text{m} $$\n\n### Step 4: Interpretation\n\nFinally, I will interpret this result in the practical context.\n\n1.  **Detection of Corneal Epithelial Microcysts:** Corneal epithelial microcysts are small, fluid-filled vesicles that typically range in diameter from about $10\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ to $50\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. The calculated theoretical diffraction-limited resolution of the slit-lamp is $R \\approx 3.36\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. Since this resolution limit is significantly smaller than the size of the microcysts, the microscope is theoretically capable of resolving individual microcysts as distinct structures. In practice, this means a clinician should be able to visualize the shape and boundary of a typical microcyst, rather than just seeing an undifferentiated, blurry patch.\n\n2.  **Role of the Patient's Pupil:** The question asks whether the patient's pupil diameter of $3\\,\\text{mm}$ is expected to limit the lateral resolution. The lateral resolution of an imaging system is determined by the numerical aperture of its objective lens, which quantifies the range of angles over which the system can accept light from the object. In slit-lamp biomicroscopy, the object being imaged is the patient's cornea. The light path for imaging is as follows: light scatters from the corneal epithelium, travels through the air, and is then collected by the microscope objective. The patient's pupil is located anatomically *posterior* to the cornea. Therefore, the cone of light collected by the objective from the cornea does not pass through the patient's pupil. The aperture that limits the collected light is the aperture of the objective lens itself, which is what defines its $\\mathrm{NA}$. Consequently, the patient's pupil diameter does not constrain the $\\mathrm{NA}$ of the imaging system and thus does not determine the diffraction-limited lateral resolution at the corneal plane. While the pupil size is critical for other examination techniques (e.g., viewing the fundus or crystalline lens) and can affect the characteristics of the *illumination* beam, it does not limit the resolving power for structures on the anterior corneal surface.\n\nIn conclusion, the slit-lamp's resolution is sufficient for the task, and this resolution is governed by the microscope's optics, not the patient's pupil.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.36}$$", "id": "4725959"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of optical resolution, this next practice moves into a common and critical diagnostic challenge: differentiating a sterile corneal infiltrate from an infectious epithelial defect.

The instrument is set first to diffuse white light and then to cobalt blue illumination with a yellow barrier filter following sodium fluorescein instillation. The clinician aims to apply first principles of optics and fluorescence to interpret the findings.\n\nUse the following fundamental base to reason from first principles:\n\n- Sodium fluorescein absorbs blue light around an excitation wavelength of approximately $485\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and emits green light around $520$–$530\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, a phenomenon explained by the Stokes shift. The yellow barrier filter (commonly a Wratten No. $12$-type) blocks reflected excitation light and passes emitted green fluorescence, thereby improving contrast by increasing the signal-to-background ratio.\n- The fluorescence emission intensity $I_f$ from a thin layer is approximately proportional to the product $I_f \\propto \\phi\\,\\epsilon\\,c\\,l\\,I_0$, where $\\phi$ is the fluorescence quantum yield, $\\epsilon$ is the molar absorptivity, $c$ is the dye concentration in the layer, $l$ is the optical path length (approximated by the thickness of the fluorescein-laden tear film over the region), and $I_0$ is the incident excitation irradiance. In regions where the epithelium is absent (an epithelial defect), fluorescein penetrates and pools, effectively increasing $c$ and $l$, producing brighter emission (positive staining). In regions where the corneal surface is elevated or where the epithelium is intact over a subepithelial lesion, the tear film is thinned or excluded, reducing $c$ and $l$, producing reduced emission (negative staining).\n- Under diffuse white light, epithelial integrity determines specular reflection at the air–tear interface, while subepithelial or stromal composition determines backscattered intensity. A corneal infiltrate consists of inflammatory cells and extracellular matrix changes in the anterior stroma or subepithelium, increasing backscatter via particle-induced scattering (qualitatively consistent with Mie scattering when particle sizes are on the order of the illumination wavelength), while the overlying epithelium often remains intact. An epithelial defect is a true discontinuity of the epithelial layer, producing a sharply demarcated surface break and loss of the continuous specular reflex at the defect margin.\n\nA patient presents with a $2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ paracentral lesion. The clinician observes, under diffuse white light, a focal gray opacity with indistinct borders and a preserved, continuous specular reflex over the lesion.

No fluorescein pooling is seen within the lesion.\n\nWhich composite set of slit-lamp criteria best differentiates a corneal infiltrate from an epithelial defect in this context, emphasizing the concept of negative staining?\n\nA. Infiltrate: Under white light, a focal anterior stromal haze with preserved overlying epithelial specular reflex; under cobalt blue with yellow barrier filter, a dark island due to reduced local fluorescein emission (negative staining) and no intra-lesional pooling. Epithelial defect: Under white light, a sharply demarcated surface break with interruption of the specular reflex; under cobalt blue with yellow barrier filter, bright fluorescence within the defect from pooling (positive staining).\n\nB.

This increases both concentration $c$ and path length $l$, resulting in brighter fluorescence.\n- **Negative Staining:** Occurs over elevated areas or areas with intact epithelium covering a subepithelial lesion. The tear film is thinned or excluded, reducing $c$ and $l$, which results in reduced fluorescence emission.\n- **Corneal Infiltrate (White Light):** An infiltrate consists of inflammatory cells in the anterior stroma/subepithelium, causing increased backscatter (appearing as a focal gray opacity with indistinct borders). The overlying epithelium is often intact, preserving the specular reflex.\n- **Epithelial Defect (White Light):** A discontinuity in the epithelial layer, appearing as a sharp surface break with an interrupted specular reflex.\n\n**Patient Presentation:**\n- **Lesion:** $2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ paracentral lesion.\n- **Observation (Diffuse White Light):** A focal gray opacity with indistinct borders and a preserved, continuous specular reflex over the lesion.\n- **Observation (Cobalt Blue with Yellow Filter after Fluorescein):** The lesion is a dark \"island\" against a bright background, with a thin bright rim at the periphery. No fluorescein pooling is observed within the lesion.\n\n**Question:**\n- To identify the composite set of slit-lamp criteria that best differentiates a corneal infiltrate from an epithelial defect, with an emphasis on negative staining.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The principles of fluorescence, Stokes shift, the Beer-Lambert law analogy for fluorescence intensity ($I_f \\propto c \\cdot l$), and the clinical descriptions of corneal infiltrates and epithelial defects are all standard and well-established in optics and ophthalmology. The description of positive and negative fluorescein staining is accurate.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear set of principles and a specific clinical case. It asks for the application of these principles to differentiate between two pathologies.

The observations are described using standard clinical terminology.\n\nThe problem statement has no identifiable flaws. It is not unsound, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or ill-posed. It requires substantive reasoning by applying provided first principles to a clinical scenario.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution will be derived by applying the given principles to the scenario and evaluating each option.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe task is to establish the definitive criteria for differentiating a corneal infiltrate from an epithelial defect, based on the provided principles and patient data.\n\n1.  **Analysis of a Corneal Infiltrate:**\n    - According to the base principles, an infiltrate is a subepithelial or stromal collection of cells. This causes increased light scattering, appearing as a \"focal gray opacity with indistinct borders\" under white light.\n    - Since the epithelium is often intact, the air-tear film interface remains smooth. This results in a \"preserved, continuous specular reflex\".\n    - The lesion may be slightly elevated. When fluorescein is instilled, the tear film over this elevated area becomes thinner than the surrounding tear film.\n    - Applying the fluorescence intensity formula, $I_f \\propto \\phi\\,\\epsilon\\,c\\,l\\,I_0$, the thinning of the tear film corresponds to a decrease in the path length $l$. This reduced path length leads to a decrease in fluorescence intensity $I_f$.\n    - Consequently, the area of the infiltrate appears as a \"dark 'island'\" against the more brightly fluorescing background of the normal tear film. This phenomenon is defined as \"negative staining\". The \"thin bright rim\" observed in the patient corresponds to the pooling of fluorescein in the trough or \"moat\" encircling the elevated lesion, where $l$ is locally increased. The absence of \"intra-lesional pooling\" confirms the epithelial integrity.\n    - The patient's presentation perfectly matches this description of a corneal infiltrate.\n\n2.  **Analysis of an Epithelial Defect:**\n    - An epithelial defect is a true absence of the epithelial layer. Under white light, this would be visible as a \"sharply demarcated surface break\". The loss of the smooth epithelial surface would cause an \"interruption of the specular reflex\".\n    - Upon fluorescein instillation, the dye penetrates the stroma and pools in the defect. This leads to a significant increase in both the effective concentration $c$ and the path length $l$ through which the excitation light travels.\n    - According to the formula $I_f \\propto \\phi\\,\\epsilon\\,c\\,l\\,I_0$, the large values of $c$ and $l$ result in a high fluorescence intensity $I_f$. The defect would therefore appear brightly fluorescent. This phenomenon is defined as \"positive staining\".\n\n3.  **Summary of Differentiating Criteria:**\n    - **Infiltrate:** Stromal haze/opacity, preserved specular reflex, negative fluorescein staining (dark area, no pooling).\n    - **Epithelial Defect:** Surface break, interrupted specular reflex, positive fluorescein staining (bright area from pooling).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Infiltrate: Under white light, a focal anterior stromal haze with preserved overlying epithelial specular reflex; under cobalt blue with yellow barrier filter, a dark island due to reduced local fluorescein emission (negative staining) and no intra-lesional pooling. Epithelial defect: Under white light, a sharply demarcated surface break with interruption of the specular reflex; under cobalt blue with yellow barrier filter, bright fluorescence within the defect from pooling (positive staining).**\n\n- This option correctly describes the signs of a corneal infiltrate: stromal haze, preserved reflex, and negative staining (dark island, no pooling). It also correctly describes the signs of an epithelial defect: surface break, interrupted reflex, and positive staining (bright pooling). This description is fully consistent with the provided first principles and the clinical case analysis.\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Infiltrate: Under white light, a sharply demarcated surface break with loss of specular reflex; under cobalt blue with yellow barrier filter, bright intra-lesional fluorescence from pooling (positive staining). Epithelial defect: Under white light, diffuse stromal haze with intact epithelium; under cobalt blue with yellow barrier filter, dark island from negative staining.**\n\n- This option incorrectly swaps the descriptions. The signs listed for \"Infiltrate\" (surface break, positive staining) are actually characteristic of an epithelial defect. The signs listed for \"Epithelial defect\" (stromal haze, negative staining) are characteristic of a corneal infiltrate.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Infiltrate and epithelial defect are indistinguishable with cobalt blue and a yellow barrier filter; only sclerotic scatter in white light can differentiate them because both show bright intra-lesional fluorescence.**\n\n- This statement is fundamentally false based on the provided principles. Fluorescein staining is a primary method for differentiating these two conditions. An infiltrate with intact epithelium shows negative staining (dark), while an epithelial defect shows positive staining (bright). The claim that \"both show bright intra-lesional fluorescence\" is incorrect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Infiltrate: Best identified without a yellow barrier filter, as the filter attenuates blue light and prevents visualization of subepithelial lesions; under cobalt blue without the filter, infiltrates show bright fluorescence. Epithelial defect: Requires the yellow barrier filter; otherwise, defects appear dark and cannot be distinguished from infiltrates.**\n\n- This option contains multiple errors regarding the function of the yellow barrier filter. The filter's purpose is to *enhance* fluorescence visualization by blocking overwhelming reflected blue excitation light, not to prevent visualization. Without the filter, the faint green fluorescence is difficult to see. The claim that infiltrates show \"bright fluorescence\" is also wrong; they show negative staining. The claim that epithelial defects appear \"dark\" without the filter is also misleading; they appear fluorescent but with very low contrast against the reflected blue light.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only one that provides a completely accurate and comprehensive set of criteria for differentiating a corneal infiltrate from an epithelial defect, consistent with the provided first principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4725997"}, {"introduction": "This final practice elevates your skills from observation and differentiation to high-stakes clinical decision-making.

On slit-lamp biomicroscopy using an obliquely incident, narrow, bright beam at approximately $60^\\circ$ to the temporal cornea in a dim room, you align the beam to form an optical section at the temporal limbus and estimate the peripheral anterior chamber depth as a fraction of the local corneal thickness.

This is a standard, universally accepted, and fundamental technique in ophthalmology and optometry. The patient's risk factors (age $> 40$, hyperopia), symptoms (halos, suggesting intermittent angle closure with transient corneal edema), and clinical signs (a very narrow angle on screening) are entirely consistent with established medical knowledge. The quoted principles are correct statements of the relationship between anterior segment anatomy and angle-closure risk. The IOP of $16$ mmHg is normal, which is expected for a primary angle-closure suspect who is not currently experiencing an acute attack. The setup is scientifically and medically sound.\n\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient data (patient profile, symptoms, specific quantitative screening result) to arrive at a logical clinical conclusion regarding risk and the next required action.

All data points are quantitative or objective observations.\n\nThe problem statement successfully passes all validation criteria. It is a well-formed, scientifically grounded clinical reasoning problem.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is **valid**.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires an interpretation of a clinical finding and a decision on the subsequent course of action. The described examination method is the Van Herick technique, a screening test to estimate the width of the iridocorneal angle.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Van Herick Finding:** The technique compares the peripheral anterior chamber depth (pACD) to the adjacent corneal thickness (CT) at the limbus. The result is a ratio, which is typically classified into a grading system. A ratio of pACD/CT of approximately $0.1$ is equivalent to the pACD being $10\\%$ of the local CT. The widely used Van Herick grading system is as follows:\n    *   Grade 4: pACD $\\ge$ CT (ratio $\\ge 1.0$). Angle is wide open ($\\approx 35-45^\\circ$).\n    *   Grade 3: pACD is between $1/4$ and $1/2$ CT (ratio $\\approx 0.25 - 0.5$). Angle is open ($\\approx 20-35^\\circ$).\n    *   Grade 2: pACD is approximately $1/4$ CT (ratio $\\approx 0.25$). Angle is narrow ($\\approx 20^\\circ$); closure is possible.\n    *   Grade 1: pACD is less than $1/4$ CT (ratio $< 0.25$). Angle is very narrow ($\\approx 10^\\circ$); high risk of closure.\n    *   Grade 0: No visible space; iris appears to be in contact with the cornea. Angle is likely closed.\n\n    The measured ratio of $0.1$ is significantly less than $0.25$. This corresponds to a **Van Herick Grade 1**, which indicates a critically narrow angle with a high risk of being occludable.\n\n2.  **Integration with Clinical Context:**\n    *   **Patient Profile:** A $62$-year-old woman is in the age range for increased risk of primary angle closure. Hyperopia is a major anatomical risk factor, as hyperopic eyes are typically smaller with a shorter axial length, leading to a crowded anterior segment.\n    *   **Symptoms:** \"Intermittent halos in dim light\" are classic symptoms of transient increases in IOP causing temporary corneal epithelial edema. This often occurs in dim lighting, which causes physiologic mydriasis (pupil dilation), further narrowing the angle in a predisposed individual and leading to intermittent appositional closure.\n    *   **IOP:** An IOP of $16$ mmHg is within the statistically normal range. This measurement is taken at a single point in time and does not rule out angle closure disease. It is typical for patients who are primary angle-closure suspects to have a normal IOP between episodes of closure.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Interpretation and Next Step:** The combination of a high-risk screening test result (Van Herick Grade 1), a high-risk patient profile (age, hyperopia), and suggestive symptoms (intermittent halos) points strongly to a high likelihood of having occludable angles. The Van Herick test, however, is a screening tool and not a definitive diagnostic test. The gold standard for diagnosing and classifying the configuration of the iridocorneal angle is **gonioscopy**. Gonioscopy allows for direct visualization of the angle structures (or their obstruction) and is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis, assess the extent of the narrow angle, and determine the underlying mechanism (e.g., pupillary block, plateau iris). This information is crucial for planning appropriate management, such as Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI) or other interventions. Therefore, the logical and required next step is to perform prompt diagnostic gonioscopy.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Low likelihood of angle closure; no gonioscopy indicated; schedule routine follow-up only**\nThis is incorrect. A pACD/CT ratio of $0.1$ (Van Herick Grade 1) signifies a *high*, not low, likelihood of angle closure. The patient's symptoms and risk factors corroborate this high risk. Failing to perform gonioscopy and simply scheduling a routine follow-up would constitute substandard care and place the patient at risk for an acute angle-closure attack and permanent vision loss.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. Borderline likelihood of angle closure; defer gonioscopy and recheck the ratio at a later date under identical conditions**\nThis is incorrect. The finding of a ratio of $0.1$ is not \"borderline\"; it is a clear high-risk finding (Grade 1). A borderline finding would be a Grade 2 (ratio of $\\approx 0.25$). Delaying gonioscopy in a symptomatic, high-risk patient is inappropriate. There is no reason to recheck the screening test when a definitive diagnostic test is indicated and readily available.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. High likelihood of occludable angles; perform prompt diagnostic gonioscopy to confirm angle configuration and plan management**\nThis is correct. As derived above, the Van Herick Grade 1 finding, together with the patient's risk profile and symptoms, indicates a high likelihood of occludable angles. The Van Herick test is a screening method, and the definitive diagnostic procedure is gonioscopy. Performing prompt gonioscopy is the essential next step to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate management plan.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Indeterminate result because the ratio is confounded by corneal thickness; rely on central anterior chamber depth alone and do not perform gonioscopy**\nThis is incorrect. The Van Herick technique is not confounded by corneal thickness; it uses the corneal thickness as an internal reference standard, which is a strength of the method. While central anterior chamber depth is another risk factor, it is less specific for peripheral angle crowding, which is the direct cause of primary angle closure. A deep central chamber can coexist with peripherally occludable angles (e.g., plateau iris configuration). Gonioscopy remains the definitive test and should not be omitted.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. High likelihood of occludable angles; proceed directly to Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI) without performing gonioscopy due to the risk of precipitating closure during examination**\nThis is incorrect. While the first part (\"High likelihood of occludable angles\") is correct, the second part is dangerously wrong. Gonioscopy is a mandatory diagnostic step before proceeding to a surgical or laser intervention like LPI. It is required to confirm that the angle is indeed occludable and to understand the mechanism of closure, which determines if LPI is the appropriate treatment. Performing LPI without a definitive diagnosis via gonioscopy is a violation of the standard of care. While there is a very small theoretical risk of inducing closure with gonioscopy, it is a routine procedure performed safely by trained clinicians, and the risk of misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment from omitting it is far greater.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4725945"}]}
