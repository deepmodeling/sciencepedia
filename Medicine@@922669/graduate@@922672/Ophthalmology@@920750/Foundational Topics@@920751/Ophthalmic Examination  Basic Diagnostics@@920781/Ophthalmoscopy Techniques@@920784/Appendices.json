It is based on fundamental principles of paraxial optics and contains sufficient, consistent information for a unique solution. We may proceed.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Definition of Optical Power and Diopter\n\nOptical power, denoted by the symbol $F$, is a measure of the degree to which a lens, mirror, or other optical system converges or diverges light. It is defined as the change in the vergence of a wavefront as it passes through the system. Vergence is the reciprocal of the distance from a reference plane to a point of convergence or divergence. For a beam of light originating from an object at a distance $s$ in a medium of refractive index $n$, the object vergence is $V = \\frac{n}{s}$. After passing through an optical system, the light forms an image at a distance $s'$ in a medium of refractive index $n'$, and the image vergence is $V' = \\frac{n'}{s'}$. The power of the system is then given by the relationship $F = V' - V$.\n\nFor a lens in air, the refractive index of the object and image space is approximately $n = n' \\approx 1$. The vergence relation simplifies to $\\frac{1}{s'} - \\frac{1}{s} = F$. By definition, the principal focal length $f$ is the image distance ($s' = f$) for an object at infinity ($s \\to \\infty$). Substituting these into the vergence relation gives $\\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{1}{\\infty} = F$, which simplifies to $F = \\frac{1}{f}$.\n\nDimensionally, focal length $f$ has the dimension of length, which we denote as $[L]$. Consequently, the optical power $F$ has the dimension of inverse length, $[L]^{-1}$.\n\nThe standard unit of optical power is the diopter, abbreviated as $\\mathrm{D}$. The diopter is defined in relation to the International System of Units (SI). If the focal length $f$ is measured in meters ($m$), the power $F$ is in diopters. The relationship is:\n$$1 \\ \\mathrm{D} = 1 \\ m^{-1}$$\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Functional Relationship between Focal Length and Power\n\nWe derive the relationship between the focal length $f$ and optical power $F$ for a thin lens in air from the given first principle: the paraxial refraction formula for a single spherical interface.\n$$\n\\frac{n'}{s'}-\\frac{n}{s}=\\frac{n'-n}{R}\n$$\nThis formula can be expressed in terms of vergence. The term $P = \\frac{n'-n}{R}$ represents the optical power of the single refracting surface. The equation becomes $V' - V = P$.\n\nConsider a thin lens of refractive index $n_L$ in air (refractive index $n_{air} \\approx 1$). The lens has two surfaces with radii of curvature $R_1$ (front surface) and $R_2$ (back surface). We use the Cartesian sign convention.\n\n**Refraction at the first surface (air to lens):**\nLight travels from air ($n=1$) to the lens ($n'=n_L$). An object is placed at distance $s_1$ from the first surface. An intermediate image is formed at distance $s'_1$.\nThe vergence equation for this surface is:\n$$\n\\frac{n_L}{s'_1} - \\frac{1}{s_1} = \\frac{n_L - 1}{R_1}\n$$\nThe power of the first surface is $P_1 = \\frac{n_L - 1}{R_1}$.\n\n**Refraction at the second surface (lens to air):**\nThe intermediate image at $s'_1$ serves as the object for the second surface. Due to the thin-lens approximation (the thickness of the lens is negligible), the object distance for the second surface is $s_2 = s'_1$. Light travels from the lens ($n=n_L$) back into air ($n'=1$). A final image is formed at distance $s'_2$.\nThe vergence equation for this surface is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{s'_2} - \\frac{n_L}{s_2} = \\frac{1 - n_L}{R_2}\n$$\nThe power of the second surface is $P_2 = \\frac{1 - n_L}{R_2}$.\n\n**Combining the surfaces:**\nWe substitute $s_2 = s'_1$ into the second equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{s'_2} - \\frac{n_L}{s'_1} = \\frac{1 - n_L}{R_2}\n$$\nNow, we add the equations for the two surfaces:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{n_L}{s'_1} - \\frac{1}{s_1} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{s'_2} - \\frac{n_L}{s'_1} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{n_L - 1}{R_1} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1 - n_L}{R_2} \\right)\n$$\nThe terms involving the intermediate image, $\\frac{n_L}{s'_1}$, cancel out. Let the initial object distance be $s=s_1$ and the final image distance be $s'=s'_2$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{s'} - \\frac{1}{s} = (n_L - 1) \\left( \\frac{1}{R_1} - \\frac{1}{R_2} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the thin-lens equation. The total optical power $F$ of the thin lens is the sum of the powers of its individual surfaces, as requested by the \"vergence addition\" principle.\n$$\nF = P_1 + P_2 = \\frac{n_L - 1}{R_1} + \\frac{1 - n_L}{R_2} = (n_L - 1) \\left( \\frac{1}{R_1} - \\frac{1}{R_2} \\right)\n$$\nComparing the thin-lens equation with the expression for total power, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{s'} - \\frac{1}{s} = F\n$$\nBy the definition of focal length $f$, when the object is at infinity ($s \\to \\infty$), the image is formed at the focal point ($s' = f$). Substituting this into the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{1}{\\infty} = F\n$$\nSince $\\frac{1}{\\infty} = 0$, we arrive at the functional relationship between the focal length $f$ of a thin lens in air and its optical power $F$:\n$$\nF = \\frac{1}{f}\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Calculation of Focal Length\n\nWe are given a condensing lens with an optical power $F = +20 \\ \\mathrm{D}$.\nUsing the definition of the diopter, we have $F = +20 \\ m^{-1}$.\nFrom the relationship derived in Part 2, the focal length $f$ is the reciprocal of the power $F$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{1}{F}\n$$\nSubstituting the given value of $F$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{1}{+20 \\ m^{-1}} = 0.05 \\ m\n$$\nThe problem requires the focal length to be expressed in millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$).

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be developed.\n\n### Derivation of Signed Lateral Magnification\n\nWe will adopt the Cartesian sign convention, where light travels from left to right. Heights above the optical axis are positive, and heights below are negative. The optical center of a lens is the origin for its respective object and image distances.\n\nThe overall magnification, $m$, is the ratio of the final aerial image height, $h_{\\text{image}}$, to the initial object height on the retina, $h_{\\text{object}}$.\n$$m = \\frac{h_{\\text{image}}}{h_{\\text{object}}}$$\nThe process can be analyzed in two stages:\n1.  Formation of a collimated beam by the patient's eye.\n2.  Formation of a real image by the condensing lens.\n\n**Stage 1: The Patient's Eye**\nAn object of height $h_{\\text{object}}$ is located on the retina. In an emmetropic reduced eye, the retina is situated at the posterior focal plane. Therefore, light rays originating from any point on the retina will emerge from the eye's optical system as a bundle of parallel rays.\nLet's consider a chief ray from the tip of the object (at height $h_{\\text{object}}$) that travels through the nodal point of the eye's optical system. This ray emerges undeviated. The angle, $\\theta_{\\text{eye}}$, this ray makes with the optical axis is given by the small-angle approximation:\n$$\\theta_{\\text{eye}} \\approx \\tan(\\theta_{\\text{eye}}) = \\frac{h_{\\text{object}}}{f'_{\\text{eye}}}$$\nwhere $f'_{\\text{eye}}$ is the posterior focal length of the eye. The power of the eye, $F_{\\text{eye}}$, is related to its focal length by $F_{\\text{eye}} = \\frac{1}{f'_{\\text{eye}}}$ (assuming the final medium is air, which is the standard convention for equivalent power in diopters, D). Thus, we can express the angle of the emergent collimated beam as:\n$$\\theta_{\\text{eye}} \\approx h_{\\text{object}} F_{\\text{eye}}$$\n\n**Stage 2: The Condensing Lens**\nThis bundle of parallel rays, traveling at an angle $\\theta_{\\text{eye}}$ with respect to the optical axis, is incident upon the condensing lens of power $F_{\\text{lens}}$. A thin lens focuses a parallel bundle of rays to a point in its back focal plane. The height of this image point, $h_{\\text{image}}$, is determined by the ray from the bundle that passes through the optical center of the lens undeviated.\n\nLet $f'_{\\text{lens}}$ be the focal length of the condensing lens, where $f'_{\\text{lens}} = \\frac{1}{F_{\\text{lens}}}$. The image is formed at a distance $f'_{\\text{lens}}$ from the lens. From the geometry, the image height $h_{\\text{image}}$ is related to the incident angle $\\theta_{\\text{eye}}$:\n$$h_{\\text{image}} = f'_{\\text{lens}} \\tan(-\\theta_{\\text{eye}}) \\approx -f'_{\\text{lens}} \\theta_{\\text{eye}}$$\nThe negative sign arises because an incoming beam with a positive angle (from an object above the axis) will focus to a point below the axis, resulting in an inverted image.\n\nSubstituting $f'_{\\text{lens}} = \\frac{1}{F_{\\text{lens}}}$, we get:\n$$h_{\\text{image}} \\approx -\\frac{\\theta_{\\text{eye}}}{F_{\\text{lens}}}$$\n\n**Overall Magnification**\nNow we combine the expressions. Substitute $\\theta_{\\text{eye}} \\approx h_{\\text{object}} F_{\\text{eye}}$ into the equation for $h_{\\text{image}}$:\n$$h_{\\text{image}} \\approx -\\frac{h_{\\text{object}} F_{\\text{eye}}}{F_{\\text{lens}}}$$\nThe signed lateral magnification $m$ is then:\n$$m = \\frac{h_{\\text{image}}}{h_{\\text{object}}} \\approx \\frac{-h_{\\text{object}} F_{\\text{eye}} / F_{\\text{lens}}}{h_{\\text{object}}}$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression:\n$$m = -\\frac{F_{\\text{eye}}}{F_{\\text{lens}}}$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nGiven $F_{\\text{eye}} = +60\\ \\text{D}$. We calculate the magnification $m$ for the three given condensing lens powers.\n\n1.  For $F_{\\text{lens}} = +14\\ \\text{D}$:\n    $$m_1 = -\\frac{60}{14} \\approx -4.2857...$$\n    Rounding to three significant figures, $m_1 = -4.29$.\n\n2.  For $F_{\\text{lens}} = +20\\ \\text{D}$:\n    $$m_2 = -\\frac{60}{20} = -3$$\n    Expressing to three significant figures, $m_2 = -3.00$.\n\n3.  For $F_{\\text{lens}} = +28\\ \\text{D}$:\n    $$m_3 = -\\frac{60}{28} \\approx -2.1428...$$\n    Rounding to three significant figures, $m_3 = -2.14$.\n\nThe final answer is the row vector of these three signed magnification values.\n\n### Interpretation of Results\n\nThe derived formula $m = -F_{\\text{eye}} / F_{\\text{lens}}$ and the calculated values provide insight into the clinical use of different condensing lenses.\n\n-   **Image Orientation (Sign):** The consistent negative sign of the magnification ($m = -4.29$, $m = -3.00$, $m = -2.14$) confirms that the aerial image formed is always inverted relative to the retinal object. This is a defining characteristic of indirect ophthalmoscopy; the examiner sees an upside-down and mirror-reversed view of the fundus and must be trained to mentally reorient the image.\n\n-   **Magnification and Field of View (Magnitude):** The magnitude of the magnification, $|m|$, is inversely proportional to the power of the condensing lens, $F_{\\text{lens}}$.\n    -   The low-power $+14\\ \\text{D}$ lens provides the highest magnification ($|m| = 4.29$). This is useful for detailed examination of specific structures like the optic nerve head or macula.\n    -   The high-power $+28\\ \\text{D}$ lens provides the lowest magnification ($|m| = 2.14$).\n    -   In optics, there is a fundamental trade-off between magnification and field of view. A lower magnification inherently provides a wider field of view. Therefore, the $+28\\ \\text{D}$ lens is ideal for general screening and surveying the peripheral retina, while the $+14\\ \\text{D}$ lens is a high-detail, narrow-field instrument. The $+20\\ \\text{D}$ lens offers a popular balance between these two extremes.\n\n-   **Working Distance:** The working distance for the examiner is related to the focal length of the condensing lens ($f'_{\\text{lens}} = 1/F_{\\text{lens}}$), as the aerial image is formed at this distance from the lens.\n    -   For the $+14\\ \\text{D}$ lens, $f'_{\\text{lens}} = 1/14 \\text{ m} \\approx 7.1 \\text{ cm}$.\n    -   For the $+28\\ \\text{D}$ lens, $f'_{\\text{lens}} = 1/28 \\text{ m} \\approx 3.6 \\text{ cm}$.\n    A higher-power lens has a shorter focal length, requiring the examiner to work closer to the patient, which can be less comfortable. A lower-power lens allows for a more comfortable, longer working distance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -4.29  -3.00  -2.14 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4703731"}, {"introduction": "A critical skill in clinical practice is confidently distinguishing a true pathological finding from a misleading artefact.

Protocol:\n- Focus bracketing: With direct ophthalmoscopy, sweep the diopter wheel from $+10\\ \\text{D}$ to $-10\\ \\text{D}$, then refine near $0\\ \\text{D}$ to find the retinal focus.

Apparent features that remain unchanged in sharpness and position across the entire sweep are considered instrumental artefacts.\n- Parallax test: With BIO and a $+20\\ \\text{D}$ condensing lens, translate the lens and observation axis laterally by $\\Delta x \\approx 5\\ \\text{mm}$ while maintaining alignment. Measure the relative displacement $\\Delta s$ of the feature against a nearby vessel. Decision: If $\\Delta s \\approx 0$ (i.e., the feature remains fixed relative to the vessel), classify as retinal. If the feature shifts opposite to the direction of translation (consistent with nearer-plane parallax) and by a magnitude larger than a clinically noticeable threshold (e.g., $ 0.1$ disc diameters), classify as pre-retinal/vitreous. If the feature moves with the instrument or disappears when alignment changes, suspect instrument reflection or dust.\n- Filter changes: Switch to red-free illumination. Decision: Increased contrast for blood-containing or nerve fiber layer retinal pathology supports a retinal origin; disappearance or inconsistent behavior with angle changes supports artefact.

I will proceed with the derivation of the correct approach and a detailed evaluation of each option.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe task is to find the protocol that correctly applies the given principles of focus, parallax, and filtration to differentiate a retinal lesion from other phenomena.\n\n**1. Focus Bracketing Principle Application:**\nIn direct ophthalmoscopy of an emmetropic patient, with the observer also being emmetropic and accommodation relaxed, the retinal plane is conjugate to infinity. This means the retinal details (e.g., blood vessels) should be in sharp focus when the ophthalmoscope's diopter wheel is set to $0\\ \\text{D}$.\n-   An object on the retina will be sharpest at or very near $0\\ \\text{D}$.\n-   An object anterior to the retina (e.g., a vitreous floater) is closer to the observer and requires more plus power (a setting of $0\\ \\text{D}$) to be brought into focus.\n-   An object posterior to the retina (e.g., in a deep excavation) would require minus power (a setting of $0\\ \\text{D}$) to be focused.\n-   An artefact on the instrument's optics (e.g., dust on the viewing lens) or the observer's spectacles will remain in sharp focus regardless of the diopter wheel setting, as it is not located within the patient's optical system that the wheel is designed to compensate for.\nTherefore, a valid focus bracketing test involves sweeping the diopter wheel and observing changes in sharpness. A retinal lesion must co-focus with the surrounding retinal vasculature.\n\n**2. Parallax Principle Application:**\nWith BIO, the observer and condensing lens are moved laterally to induce parallax. The retina serves as the reference plane (the \"background\").\n-   An object on the retina will move in tandem with other retinal structures. It will exhibit zero parallax relative to a nearby retinal blood vessel.\n-   According to Principle 3, a nearer object (anterior to the retina, e.g., a vitreous floater) will appear to move in the a direction *opposite* to the translation of the observer/lens, relative to the retinal background. This is \"against\" motion.\n-   An object posterior to the retina (e.g., a deep choroidal feature viewed through a transparent retina) is farther away and will appear to move in the *same* direction as the observer/lens. This is \"with\" motion.\nA valid parallax test correctly interprets these relative motions to determine the axial location of the feature.\n\n**3. Filter Principle Application:**\nAccording to Principle 4, red-free (green) light enhances the visibility of features containing hemoglobin because it is strongly absorbed.\n-   Vascular structures, hemorrhages, and microaneurysms will appear darker and more contrasted against the brighter, greenish retinal background.\n-   Pigmented lesions will remain dark.\n-   Artefacts like dust or reflections will not show this specific contrast enhancement and may change color or disappear based on viewing angle, but not in a way that mimics hemoglobin absorption.\nA valid filter test uses the appropriate filter and correctly interprets the resulting contrast changes based on the suspected nature of the lesion.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Protocol:**\n-   **Focus bracketing:** This description is correct. A true retinal lesion is only sharp at the retinal plane (near $0\\ \\text{D}$ for an emmetrope) and blurs outside this range (e.g., with a shift of $\\lvert \\Delta D \\rvert \\geq 2\\ \\text{D}$). An artefact that remains sharp across all diopter settings is correctly identified as instrumental.\n-   **Parallax test:** This description is correct. Zero relative displacement ($\\Delta s \\approx 0$) against a nearby retinal vessel correctly identifies the feature as being on the retinal plane. Apparent motion opposite to the direction of translation correctly identifies an object as pre-retinal. The mention of instrument reflections is also accurate.\n-   **Filter changes:** This description is correct. Red-free light is used appropriately to look for enhanced contrast of blood-containing structures. The behavior of artefacts is also correctly described.\n-   **Integration:** The requirement for at least two concordant findings is a robust and clinically sound decision-making strategy.\n-   **Verdict:** This option provides a scientifically and operationally correct protocol that matches all derived principles. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Protocol:**\n-   **Focus bracketing:** This is incorrect. Setting the focus to $+6\\ \\text{D}$ for an emmetropic eye focuses far anterior to the retina, in the vicinity of the crystalline lens or anterior vitreous. A retinal lesion would be completely out of focus at this setting.\n-   **Parallax test:** This is incorrect. A retinal feature shows zero relative motion. Motion in the same direction (\"with\" motion) indicates a *posterior* location, not retinal. Opposite motion indicates an *anterior* location (pre-retinal), not a generic artefact.\n-   **Filter changes:** This is incorrect. Cobalt blue light is primarily used with fluorescein dye for angiography or to observe autofluorescence (e.g., optic nerve drusen). It is not a standard filter for general lesion identification, and the criterion \"any feature that brightens is retinal\" is baseless.\n-   **Verdict:** This option is fundamentally flawed in its description of all three tests. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Protocol:**\n-   **Focus bracketing:** This is incorrect. It states that a retinal lesion remains sharp at all settings, which is the exact opposite of the truth. This describes an instrumental artefact, not a retinal lesion.\n-   **Parallax test:** This completely misunderstands the utility of parallax in BIO. Parallax is a cornerstone of depth localization with BIO. While the image is inverted, the principles of relative motion remain valid and are essential for clinical diagnosis. To disregard it is a major error.\n-   **Filter changes:** This is incorrect. Red-free (green) light makes pigmented (melanotic) lesions appear darker or more prominent against the green background due to absorption; it does not cause them to disappear.\n-   **Verdict:** This option contains egregious errors in its understanding of every principle. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Protocol:**\n-   **Focus bracketing:** This is incorrect. Failing to adjust focus is improper technique. One must actively focus the instrument on the plane of interest (the retina). Relying on a \"factory default\" is absurd, and this would make examination impossible for any non-emmetropic patient or if the observer is not emmetropic.\n-   **Parallax test:** This is incorrect. It states that *any* relative movement signifies a retinal lesion. The correct principle is that *no* relative movement signifies a retinal lesion. Any movement indicates a non-retinal location (anterior or posterior).\n-   **Filter changes:** This is incorrect. Infrared light is used for its deep penetration, making it useful for visualizing choroidal and deep retinal structures, not for identifying artefacts. The claim that any feature persisting in IR is an artefact is unfounded.\n-   **Verdict:** This option recommends improper procedures and uses incorrect reasoning for all tests. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption A is the only one that presents a protocol where every step—focus bracketing, parallax testing, and filter changes—is described correctly according to established optical principles and standard clinical practice. The integration of results reflects sound clinical judgment. The other options (B, C, D) contain multiple, disqualifying scientific and procedural errors.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4703839"}]}
