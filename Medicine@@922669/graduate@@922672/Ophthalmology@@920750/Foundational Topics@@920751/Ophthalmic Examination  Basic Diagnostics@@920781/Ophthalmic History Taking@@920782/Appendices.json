You are seeing a $58$-year-old woman with long-standing hyperopia who presents with sudden right eye pain and headache, nausea, blurred vision, and “rainbow halos around lights” worse in dim illumination for approximately $12$ hours. She denies trauma. Past ocular records note “narrow angles” from a prior optometrist visit. She reports starting an over-the-counter decongestant containing pseudoephedrine $2$ days ago. She reports a generalized rash with “sulfa” medications in the past. Family history is positive for her mother having an acute “high eye pressure” attack. On examination, the right eye (oculus dexter, OD) best-corrected visual acuity is $20/80$ and the left eye (oculus sinister, OS) is $20/25$. Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) measures intraocular pressure of $52$ mmHg OD and $18$ mmHg OS. Slit-lamp examination reveals corneal microcystic edema, a shallow anterior chamber, and a mid-dilated, sluggish pupil in the right eye.

Bayesian reasoning provides a formal mathematical framework to perform this crucial task, allowing you to quantify precisely how a new piece of information should alter your diagnostic suspicion. In this practice, you will use a likelihood ratio—a key concept in evidence-based medicine—to calculate the updated probability of a serious condition, a retinal tear, after a patient reports a specific symptom [@problem_id:4703361].", "problem": "An experienced ophthalmologist is designing a triage protocol for adult patients presenting to an eye emergency service. During ophthalmic history taking, the clinician records whether the patient reports new-onset floaters within the past $24$ hours. The target condition is a retinal tear. Let $D$ denote the presence of a retinal tear and $S$ denote the history feature “new-onset floaters.” The baseline (pre-test) probability of retinal tear among all adult non-trauma ophthalmic presentations in this service is $P(D) = 0.02$.

If you reference other history elements such as flashes or Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD), assume they are not being combined in the calculation for this question.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in the principles of Bayesian inference as applied to medical diagnostics. All necessary information is provided.\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the posterior probability $P(D \\mid S)$ given the prior probability $P(D)$ and the positive likelihood ratio $\\mathrm{LR}_{S}$, and then to compute its numerical value.\n\nWe begin with the definition of conditional probability, which leads to Bayes' theorem. The probability of event $A$ given event $B$ is defined as:\n$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nFrom this, we can write $P(A \\cap B) = P(A \\mid B) P(B)$. By symmetry, $P(A \\cap B) = P(B \\mid A) P(A)$. Equating these two expressions gives Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(A \\mid B) P(B) = P(B \\mid A) P(A) \\implies P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}$$\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has a retinal tear (the disease) and $S$ be the event that the patient reports new-onset floaters (the sign/symptom). We are interested in finding the posterior probability of a retinal tear given the report of floaters, which is $P(D \\mid S)$. Applying Bayes' theorem, we have:\n$$P(D \\mid S) = \\frac{P(S \\mid D) P(D)}{P(S)}$$\nThe term $P(D)$ is the prior probability of the disease. The term $P(S \\mid D)$ is the probability of the sign given the disease (sensitivity). The term $P(S)$ is the overall probability of observing the sign in the population. We can expand $P(S)$ using the law of total probability, considering the two mutually exclusive states: disease present ($D$) and disease absent ($\\neg D$):\n$$P(S) = P(S \\mid D) P(D) + P(S \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)$$\nSubstituting this into Bayes' theorem gives:\n$$P(D \\mid S) = \\frac{P(S \\mid D) P(D)}{P(S \\mid D) P(D) + P(S \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}$$\nThis equation expresses the posterior probability in terms of the prior probability and the conditional probabilities of the sign.\n\nTo use the likelihood ratio, we transition to the odds-based formulation. The odds of an event $A$ are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring:\n$$\\text{Odds}(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{P(\\neg A)} = \\frac{P(A)}{1 - P(A)}$$\nThe prior odds of disease are $\\text{Odds}(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{1-P(D)}$. The posterior odds of disease, given the sign $S$, are $\\text{Odds}(D \\mid S) = \\frac{P(D \\mid S)}{P(\\neg D \\mid S)}$.\n\nLet us derive an expression for the posterior odds. Using Bayes' theorem for both $P(D \\mid S)$ and $P(\\neg D \\mid S)$:\n$$P(D \\mid S) = \\frac{P(S \\mid D) P(D)}{P(S)}$$\n$$P(\\neg D \\mid S) = \\frac{P(S \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}{P(S)}$$\nDividing the first equation by the second, the common denominator $P(S)$ cancels:\n$$\\frac{P(D \\mid S)}{P(\\neg D \\mid S)} = \\frac{P(S \\mid D) P(D)}{P(S \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}$$\nWe can rearrange the terms on the right-hand side:\n$$\\frac{P(D \\mid S)}{P(\\neg D \\mid S)} = \\left(\\frac{P(S \\mid D)}{P(S \\mid \\neg D)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(D)}{P(\\neg D)}\\right)$$\nRecognizing the terms, this is:\n$$\\text{Odds}(D \\mid S) = \\mathrm{LR}_{S} \\times \\text{Odds}(D)$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{LR}_{S} = \\frac{P(S \\mid D)}{P(S \\mid \\neg D)}$ is the given positive likelihood ratio for the sign $S$. This elegant relationship states that the posterior odds are the prior odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio.\n\nFinally, we must convert the posterior odds back to a probability. If we let $O_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}(D \\mid S)$, then:\n$$O_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{P(D \\mid S)}{1 - P(D \\mid S)}$$\nSolving for $P(D \\mid S)$:\n$$O_{\\text{post}}(1 - P(D \\mid S)) = P(D \\mid S)$$\n$$O_{\\text{post}} - O_{\\text{post}}P(D \\mid S) = P(D \\mid S)$$\n$$O_{\\text{post}} = P(D \\mid S) (1 + O_{\\text{post}})$$\n$$P(D \\mid S) = \\frac{O_{\\text{post}}}{1 + O_{\\text{post}}}$$\nSubstituting our expressions for $O_{\\text{post}}$, $\\mathrm{LR}_S$, and $\\text{Odds}(D)$:\n$$P(D \\mid S) = \\frac{\\mathrm{LR}_{S} \\times \\text{Odds}(D)}{1 + \\mathrm{LR}_{S} \\times \\text{Odds}(D)} = \\frac{\\mathrm{LR}_{S} \\frac{P(D)}{1-P(D)}}{1 + \\mathrm{LR}_{S} \\frac{P(D)}{1-P(D)}}$$\nThis is the desired expression for the posterior probability $P(D \\mid S)$ in terms of the prior probability $P(D)$ and the likelihood ratio $\\mathrm{LR}_{S}$.\n\nA likelihood ratio is particularly appropriate for quantifying the diagnostic value of a history feature because it is a property of the test or sign itself, independent of the prevalence of the disease in the population being tested. It directly answers the clinically relevant question: \"How much does this finding change my suspicion of the disease?\". This separation of test characteristics ($\\mathrm{LR}_{S}$) from population characteristics ($P(D)$) makes it a robust and transportable measure for clinical decision-making.\n\nThe assumption of conditional independence is relevant when combining multiple, distinct pieces of evidence. For example, if we were considering both floaters ($S_1$) and flashes ($S_2$), we would need to assume that, given the presence of a retinal tear, the occurrence of floaters is independent of the occurrence of flashes (i.e., $P(S_1 \\cap S_2 \\mid D) = P(S_1 \\mid D)P(S_2 \\mid D)$). In this problem, however, we are updating the probability based on only a single feature, $S$. Therefore, the concept of conditional independence between different findings is not invoked or required.\n\nNow we compute the numerical value.\nGiven:\n- Prior probability, $P(D) = 0.02$.\n- Positive likelihood ratio, $\\mathrm{LR}_{S} = 6.5$.\n\nFirst, calculate the prior odds of having a retinal tear:\n$$\\text{Odds}(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{1 - P(D)} = \\frac{0.02}{1 - 0.02} = \\frac{0.02}{0.98} = \\frac{2}{98} = \\frac{1}{49}$$\nNext, calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:\n$$\\text{Odds}(D \\mid S) = \\mathrm{LR}_{S} \\times \\text{Odds}(D) = 6.5 \\times \\frac{1}{49} = \\frac{6.5}{49}$$\nFinally, convert the posterior odds back to a probability:\n$$P(D \\mid S) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(D \\mid S)}{1 + \\text{Odds}(D \\mid S)} = \\frac{\\frac{6.5}{49}}{1 + \\frac{6.5}{49}} = \\frac{\\frac{6.5}{49}}{\\frac{49}{49} + \\frac{6.5}{49}} = \\frac{\\frac{6.5}{49}}{\\frac{55.5}{49}}$$\n$$P(D \\mid S) = \\frac{6.5}{55.5} = \\frac{13}{111}$$\nTo obtain the decimal value, we perform the division:\n$$P(D \\mid S) = \\frac{13}{111} \\approx 0.117117117...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.1171$.\nThe presence of new-onset floaters increases the probability of a retinal tear from a baseline of $2\\%$ to approximately $11.7\\%$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1171}$$", "id": "4703361"}]}
