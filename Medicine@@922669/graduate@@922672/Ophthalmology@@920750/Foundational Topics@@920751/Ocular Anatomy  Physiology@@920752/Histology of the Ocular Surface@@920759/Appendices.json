It provides a standard biophysical model of an epithelial sheet and requires a derivation from first principles followed by a calculation. All necessary data are provided, and the context is consistent with established principles in cell physiology and biophysics.\n\nWe are tasked with deriving the expression for the total transepithelial electrical resistance, $R_T$, of the corneal epithelium. The epithelium is modeled as two concurrent electrical pathways: a paracellular route with resistance $R_p$ and a transcellular route with resistance $R_t$. The term \"concurrent pathways\" implies they are in parallel. This means that the transepithelial potential difference, let's call it $\\Delta V$, applied across the entire sheet is the same as the potential difference across each individual pathway.\n\nThe derivation must start from fundamental principles: Ohm's law and the conservation of current.\n\nLet $I_p$ be the current flowing through the paracellular pathway and $I_t$ be the current flowing through the transcellular pathway. According to Ohm's law, the current through each pathway is given by the potential difference across it divided by its resistance. Since the potential difference $\\Delta V$ is the same for both pathways, we can write:\n$$\nI_p = \\frac{\\Delta V}{R_p}\n$$\nand\n$$\nI_t = \\frac{\\Delta V}{R_t}\n$$\nThe problem is set in a steady-state condition where current is conserved. This is an application of Kirchhoff's Current Law to the node where the total current splits into the two pathways. The total current, $I_T$, flowing through the epithelial sheet must be the sum of the currents flowing through the individual parallel pathways:\n$$\nI_T = I_p + I_t\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $I_p$ and $I_t$ from Ohm's law into the current conservation equation:\n$$\nI_T = \\frac{\\Delta V}{R_p} + \\frac{\\Delta V}{R_t}\n$$\nWe can factor out the common term $\\Delta V$:\n$$\nI_T = \\Delta V \\left( \\frac{1}{R_p} + \\frac{1}{R_t} \\right)\n$$\nThe equivalent or total transepithelial resistance, $R_T$, is defined by applying Ohm's law to the entire system. It relates the total current $I_T$ to the total potential difference $\\Delta V$:\n$$\n\\Delta V = I_T R_T\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to express $I_T$ as:\n$$\nI_T = \\frac{\\Delta V}{R_T}\n$$\nWe now have two expressions for the total current $I_T$. Equating them yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta V}{R_T} = \\Delta V \\left( \\frac{1}{R_p} + \\frac{1}{R_t} \\right)\n$$\nSince a small potential difference is applied, $\\Delta V$ is non-zero, and we can divide both sides of the equation by $\\Delta V$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R_T} = \\frac{1}{R_p} + \\frac{1}{R_t}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the reciprocal of the total resistance is the sum of the reciprocals of the individual parallel resistances. To solve for $R_T$, we first find a common denominator for the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R_T} = \\frac{R_t}{R_p R_t} + \\frac{R_p}{R_p R_t} = \\frac{R_p + R_t}{R_p R_t}\n$$\nFinally, taking the reciprocal of both sides gives the desired expression for the equivalent transepithelial resistance $R_T$:\n$$\nR_T = \\frac{R_p R_t}{R_p + R_t}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to compute the numerical value of $R_T$ given the values $R_p = 2000\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}$ and $R_t = 10000\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}$.

Fundamentally, limbal stem cells in the basal layer of the limbal epithelium undergo divisions that either self-renew or generate differentiating progeny destined for corneal epithelial turnover. The histologically meaningful assumptions are: each stem cell produces divisions at a constant rate, divisions are memoryless, and differentiation removes cells from the stem cell compartment.\n\nStarting assumptions and definitions (fundamental base):\n- A single labeled limbal stem cell initiates a clone at time $t = 0$.\n- Each stem cell divides at rate $r$ divisions per day, with exponentially distributed inter-division times and independent behavior across cells, consistent with a continuous-time Markov process.\n- At each division, one of three outcomes occurs:\n  1.

All provided parameter sets are consistent with the constraint $p_{\\mathrm{sym\\_self}} + p_{\\mathrm{asym}} + p_{\\mathrm{sym\\_diff}} = 1$. The problem is therefore **valid**. I will proceed with deriving and implementing the solution.\n\n## Mathematical Derivation and Solution Design\n\nThe number of stem cells in a clone, $N(t)$, follows a linear birth-death process with per-capita birth rate $\\lambda$ and per-capita death rate $\\mu$, starting from an initial population of $N(0)=1$. We need to find the probability mass function $p_n(t) = P(N(t)=n | N(0)=1)$ for $n \\ge 0$. The solution differs depending on whether $\\lambda = \\mu$.\n\n### Case 1: Non-critical process ($\\lambda \\neq \\mu$)\nFor a linear birth-death process with $N(0)=1$ and $\\lambda \\neq \\mu$, the transient probabilities are given by a modified geometric distribution. The probability of the clone going extinct by time $t$, $p_0(t)$, is:\n$$p_0(t) = \\frac{\\mu(e^{(\\lambda-\\mu)t} - 1)}{\\lambda e^{(\\lambda-\\mu)t} - \\mu}$$\nFor a population size $n \\ge 1$, the probabilities are given by:\n$$p_n(t) = \\frac{(\\lambda-\\mu)^2 e^{(\\lambda-\\mu)t}}{(\\lambda e^{(\\lambda-\\mu)t}-\\mu)^2} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda(e^{(\\lambda-\\mu)t} - 1)}{\\lambda e^{(\\lambda-\\mu)t} - \\mu} \\right)^{n-1}$$\nThis can be expressed more compactly. Let us define a common ratio term $\\xi(t)$:\n$$\\xi(t) = \\frac{\\lambda(e^{(\\lambda-\\mu)t} - 1)}{\\lambda e^{(\\lambda-\\mu)t} - \\mu}$$\nThen, for $n \\ge 1$, the probabilities form a geometric series:\n$$p_n(t) = p_1(t) \\cdot [\\xi(t)]^{n-1}$$\nwhere $p_1(t)$ is given by:\n$$p_1(t) = \\frac{(\\lambda-\\mu)^2 e^{(\\lambda-\\mu)t}}{(\\lambda e^{(\\lambda-\\mu)t}-\\mu)^2}$$\nThese formulas are numerically stable and well-defined for all $\\lambda \\neq \\mu$ and $t  0$. They also correctly handle the pure birth ($\\mu=0$) and pure death ($\\lambda=0$) processes as special cases.\n\n### Case 2: Critical process ($\\lambda = \\mu$)\nWhen the birth and death rates are equal, the process is critical. The probabilities are found by taking the limit $\\lambda \\to \\mu$ in the expressions above. Let $\\lambda = \\mu$. The probability of extinction by time $t$ is:\n$$p_0(t) = \\frac{\\mu t}{1 + \\mu t}$$\nFor $n \\ge 1$, the probabilities are given by:\n$$p_n(t) = \\frac{1}{(1+\\mu t)^2} \\left( \\frac{\\mu t}{1+\\mu t} \\right)^{n-1}$$\nSimilar to the non-critical case, we can define a ratio term $\\xi(t)$:\n$$\\xi(t) = \\frac{\\mu t}{1 + \\mu t}$$\nand the probabilities for $n \\ge 1$ are:\n$$p_n(t) = p_1(t) \\cdot [\\xi(t)]^{n-1}$$\nwhere $p_1(t)$ is:\n$$p_1(t) = \\frac{1}{(1+\\mu t)^2}$$\nA special sub-case is $\\lambda = \\mu = 0$, which corresponds to the purely asymmetric division scenario. In this situation, the number of stem cells never changes. With $N(0)=1$, we must have $N(t)=1$ for all $t  0$. Thus, $p_1(t)=1$ and $p_n(t)=0$ for all $n \\neq 1$. The general formula for the critical case correctly reduces to this result when $\\mu=0$.\n\n### Algorithm for Implementation\nFor each test case, the algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1. Calculate the per-cell birth rate $\\lambda = r \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{sym\\_self}}$ and death rate $\\mu = r \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{sym\\_diff}}$ using the given parameters $r=0.05$, $p_{\\mathrm{sym\\_self}}$, and $p_{\\mathrm{sym\\_diff}}$.\n2. Determine if the process is critical by checking if $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are equal within a small numerical tolerance.\n3. Based on the case ($\\lambda = \\mu$ or $\\lambda \\neq \\mu$), use the corresponding set of formulas to compute $p_0(T)$ and the parameters for the geometric part of the distribution ($p_1(T)$ and $\\xi(T)$) at the time horizon $T=180$ days.\n4. Generate the probability distribution for $n = 0, 1, \\dots, K$ (where $K=50$). This is done by first storing $p_0(T)$, then calculating $p_1(T)$, and iteratively computing $p_n(T) = p_{n-1}(T) \\cdot \\xi(T)$ for $n = 2, \\dots, K$.\n5. Calculate the aggregated tail probability $P(N(T)  K)$ by summing the computed probabilities from $n=0$ to $K$ and subtracting the result from $1$.\n$$P(N(T)  K) = 1 - \\sum_{n=0}^{K} P(N(T)=n)$$\n6. Store the resulting vector of $K+2$ probabilities: $[p_0(T), p_1(T), \\dots, p_K(T), P(N(T)K)]$.\n7.
