A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Expression for Intraocular Pressure ($P$)**\n\nThe core principle for this problem is the conservation of mass at steady state. For an incompressible fluid like aqueous humor, this is equivalent to the conservation of volume flow rate. At steady state, the total rate of aqueous humor inflow must equal the total rate of aqueous humor outflow.\n\nThe total inflow rate is given as a constant, $F_{in}$.\n\nThe total outflow, $F_{out}$, is the sum of the outflow through the two specified pathways: the conventional (trabecular) pathway and the uveoscleral pathway.\n$$F_{out} = F_{conv} + F_{uveo}$$\nwhere $F_{conv}$ is the conventional outflow rate and $F_{uveo}$ is the uveoscleral outflow rate.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, each outflow pathway follows a linear conductance relation.\nThe conventional outflow, $F_{conv}$, is proportional to the pressure drop between the anterior chamber (at pressure $P$) and the episcleral veins (at pressure $P_{e}$), with the constant of proportionality being the conventional outflow facility, $C_{conv}$.\n$$F_{conv} = C_{conv}(P - P_{e})$$\n\nSimilarly, the uveoscleral outflow, $F_{uveo}$, is proportional to the pressure drop between the anterior chamber (at pressure $P$) and the supraciliary space (at pressure $P_{supra}$), with the constant of proportionality being the uveoscleral outflow facility, $C_{uveo}$.\n$$F_{uveo} = C_{uveo}(P - P_{supra})$$\n\nThe steady-state condition is $F_{in} = F_{out}$. Substituting the expressions for the outflow components, we get:\n$$F_{in} = F_{conv} + F_{uveo}$$\n$$F_{in} = C_{conv}(P - P_{e}) + C_{uveo}(P - P_{supra})$$\n\nOur goal is to derive an expression for the intraocular pressure, $P$. We must rearrange the equation to solve for $P$. First, we distribute the facility terms on the right-hand side:\n$$F_{in} = C_{conv}P - C_{conv}P_{e} + C_{uveo}P - C_{uveo}P_{supra}$$\n\nNext, we group terms containing $P$ and move all other terms to the other side of the equation:\n$$F_{in} + C_{conv}P_{e} + C_{uveo}P_{supra} = C_{conv}P + C_{uveo}P$$\n\nFactor out $P$ on the right-hand side:\n$$F_{in} + C_{conv}P_{e} + C_{uveo}P_{supra} = (C_{conv} + C_{uveo})P$$\n\nFinally, we isolate $P$ by dividing by the sum of the outflow facilities:\n$$P = \\frac{F_{in} + C_{conv}P_{e} + C_{uveo}P_{supra}}{C_{conv} + C_{uveo}}$$\nThis is the general expression for the intraocular pressure, $P$.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation of $P$**\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression:\n- $F_{in} = 2.6 \\mathrm{\\mu L/min}$\n- $C_{conv} = 0.18 \\mathrm{\\mu L/(min \\cdot mmHg)}$\n- $C_{uveo} = 0.06 \\mathrm{\\mu L/(min \\cdot mmHg)}$\n- $P_{e} = 9 \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $P_{supra} = 0 \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n\n$$P = \\frac{2.6 + (0.18)(9) + (0.06)(0)}{0.18 + 0.06}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator:\n$$Numerator = 2.6 + 1.62 + 0 = 4.22$$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator:\n$$Denominator = 0.18 + 0.06 = 0.24$$\n\nNow we perform the division:\n$$P = \\frac{4.22}{0.24} = 17.58333...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$P \\approx 17.6$$\nThe units are consistent, as $(\\mathrm{\\mu L/min}) / (\\mathrm{\\mu L/(min \\cdot mmHg)}) = \\mathrm{mmHg}$.
