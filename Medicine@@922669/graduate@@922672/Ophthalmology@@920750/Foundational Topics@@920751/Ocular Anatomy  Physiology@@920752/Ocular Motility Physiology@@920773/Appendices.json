To surmount plant viscosity and produce a fast displacement, the premotor system utilizes a phasic \"pulse\" of innervation whose width equals the saccade duration, followed by a tonic \"step\" to hold the new position.

This can be formalized by expressing the velocity profile as $v(t) = v_{peak} \\cdot f(t/T)$, where $v_{peak}$ is the characteristic peak velocity (assumed to be constant in this regime) and $f(\\tau)$ is a normalized, dimensionless function describing the shape of the velocity profile over the normalized time $\\tau = t/T$. The function $f(\\tau)$ is non-zero for $\\tau \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nSubstituting this form of $v(t)$ into the amplitude integral:\n$$\nA = \\int_{0}^{T} v_{peak} f\\left(\\frac{t}{T}\\right) \\,dt\n$$\nWe perform a change of variables with $\\tau = t/T$, which implies $dt = T\\,d\\tau$. The limits of integration change from $t=0$ and $t=T$ to $\\tau=0$ and $\\tau=1$:\n$$\nA = \\int_{0}^{1} v_{peak} f(\\tau) (T\\,d\\tau) = v_{peak} T \\int_{0}^{1} f(\\tau) \\,d\\tau\n$$\nThe term $\\int_{0}^{1} f(\\tau) \\,d\\tau$ is a dimensionless constant that depends only on the shape of the velocity profile. Let us denote this constant by $C_{shape}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\nA = v_{peak} \\cdot C_{shape} \\cdot T\n$$\nSince $v_{peak}$ and $C_{shape}$ are assumed to be constant for the saccades under consideration, this equation shows that the amplitude $A$ is directly proportional to the duration $T$, i.e., $A \\propto T$.\n\nThe problem states that the neural innervation for a saccade consists of a phasic \"pulse\" whose width, let's call it $w$, is equal to the saccade duration $T$. That is, $w(A) = T(A)$.\nTherefore, the neural pulse width $w$ must also be proportional to the amplitude $A$. This explains why the pulse width must be modulated to control saccade amplitude: to move the eye a larger distance under the constraint of a fixed-peak-velocity motor command, the command must be applied for a longer time.\n\nThe provided empirical model, $T(A) = T_0+k\\,A$, refines the simple proportionality. The term $kA$ represents the linear scaling between amplitude and duration that we derived. The term $T_0$ represents a baseline duration that is independent of amplitude, accounting for fixed latencies in the oculomotor system such as neural conduction delays and the time required for muscle force to build.\n\nGiven that the neural pulse width $w(A)$ is defined to be equal to the saccade duration $T(A)$, the analytical scaling relationship for the pulse width as a function of $A$, $T_0$, and $k$ must be identical to the relationship for the duration.\n$$\nw(A) = T(A) = T_0 + kA\n$$\nThis is the required analytical scaling relationship for the pulse width.\n\nThe final answer requires the three computed durations and this symbolic expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 31 & 42 & 86 & T_0 + kA \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4698737"}, {"introduction": "The oculomotor system is not static; it exhibits remarkable plasticity, constantly adapting to maintain accuracy in the face of injury, disease, or developmental changes.

The magnitude of this displacement is $sA$. Thus, the final target position is:\n$$\\text{Final Target Position} = A - sA = (1 - s)A$$\n\nThe executed saccade amplitude on trial $n$ is given as $g_n A$.
