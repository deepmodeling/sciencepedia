A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation\nThe transport of the tracer across the barrier is governed by Fick's first law of diffusion. For one-dimensional, steady-state diffusion, the mass flux $j$ (mass per unit area per unit time) is constant and is given by:\n$$j = -D \\frac{dC_b(x)}{dx}$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient within the barrier and $C_b(x)$ is the concentration of the tracer within the barrier at position $x$. We define the blood-side of the barrier as $x=0$ and the tissue-side as $x=\\Delta x$.\n\nSince $j$ and $D$ are constant under the given assumptions, we can integrate this equation across the thickness of the barrier, $\\Delta x$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\Delta x} j \\, dx = -\\int_{C_{b,1}}^{C_{b,2}} D \\, dC_b$$\n$$j \\Delta x = -D (C_{b,2} - C_{b,1})$$\n$$j = \\frac{D}{\\Delta x} (C_{b,1} - C_{b,2})$$\nHere, $C_{b,1}$ is the tracer concentration at the interface on the blood side ($x=0$) *within the barrier*, and $C_{b,2}$ is the concentration at the interface on the tissue side ($x=\\Delta x$) *within the barrier*.\n\nThese interface concentrations are related to the concentrations in the adjacent bulk fluids (blood and tissue) by the equilibrium partition coefficient, $K$. The problem defines $K$ as the ratio of the barrier concentration to the blood concentration. We assume this relationship holds at both interfaces.\nLet $C_{\\text{blood}}$ be the concentration in the blood and $C_{\\text{tissue}}$ be the concentration in the retinal tissue.\nAt the blood-barrier interface ($x=0$):\n$$C_{b,1} = K \\cdot C_{\\text{blood}}$$\nAt the barrier-tissue interface ($x=\\Delta x$):\n$$C_{b,2} = K \\cdot C_{\\text{tissue}}$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for flux:\n$$j = \\frac{D}{\\Delta x} (K \\cdot C_{\\text{blood}} - K \\cdot C_{\\text{tissue}})$$\n$$j = \\frac{KD}{\\Delta x} (C_{\\text{blood}} - C_{\\text{tissue}})$$\nThe problem defines the overall concentration difference as $\\Delta C = C_{\\text{blood}} - C_{\\text{tissue}}$. Therefore, the flux is:\n$$j = \\frac{KD}{\\Delta x} \\Delta C$$\n\nThe permeability, $P$, of a barrier is defined as the proportionality constant that relates the flux to the overall concentration difference across the barrier:\n$$j = P \\cdot \\Delta C$$\nBy comparing the two expressions for the flux $j$, we can identify the permeability $P$:\n$$P = \\frac{KD}{\\Delta x}$$\n\nThe total steady-state trans-barrier mass transfer rate, denoted as $J$ in the problem's numerical part, is the flux $j$ multiplied by the planar area $A$ of the barrier:\n$$J = j \\cdot A$$\nSubstituting the derived relations gives the expression for the mass transfer rate:\n$$J = P \\cdot A \\cdot \\Delta C = \\left(\\frac{KD}{\\Delta x}\\right) A \\cdot \\Delta C$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n- $D = 1 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$\n- $K = 0.5$\n- $\\Delta x = 5 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm}$\n- $A = 1~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$\n- $\\Delta C = 10~\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{cm}^{3}$\n\nFirst, we compute the permeability, $P$:\n$$P = \\frac{KD}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{(0.5) \\cdot (1 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s})}{5 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm}}$$\n$$P = \\frac{0.5 \\times 10^{-6}}{5 \\times 10^{-4}}~\\frac{\\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}}{\\mathrm{cm}} = 0.1 \\times 10^{-2}~\\mathrm{cm}/\\mathrm{s} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{cm}/\\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding to two significant figures, as requested:\n$$P = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{cm}/\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nNext, we compute the mass transfer rate, $J$:\n$$J = P \\cdot A \\cdot \\Delta C$$\nUsing the calculated value for $P$:\n$$J = (1 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{cm}/\\mathrm{s}) \\cdot (1~\\mathrm{cm}^{2}) \\cdot (10~\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{cm}^{3})$$\n$$J = 10 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{s} = 1 \\times 10^{-2}~\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding to two significant figures, as requested:\n$$J = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}~\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nThe final numerical values for the pair $(P, J)$ are $(1.0 \\times 10^{-3}, 1.0 \\times 10^{-2})$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} & 1.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4658863"}, {"introduction": "Beyond regulating solutes, the blood-ocular barriers are critical for controlling fluid balance within the eye.

Consider transcellular transport across an RPE monolayer of thickness $L$, with membrane diffusion coefficient $D_m$ and an aqueous-to-membrane partition coefficient $K$ (lipophilicity), defined as the ratio of membrane concentration to aqueous concentration at equilibrium. The apical side (subretinal space) is maintained at concentration $C_a$, and the basal side (choroidal side) behaves as a sink with $C_b \\approx 0$. Passive transcellular transport obeys Fick’s first law, and the permeability coefficient $P_m$ for the transcellular route depends on membrane properties. The apical membrane expresses an efflux transporter (for example, P-glycoprotein and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein), which removes drug from the cytosol back into the apical compartment according to a saturable Michaelis–Menten rate with maximum efflux flux per unit area $v_{max}$ and half-saturation constant $K_m$. At steady state, the intracellular concentration near the apical membrane may be approximated by the partitioning relation between the apical aqueous phase and the membrane/cytosolic compartment.\n\nUsing only these foundational facts and relationships—Fick’s first law of diffusion, the definition of $K$ as a partition coefficient, and saturable transporter kinetics—reason about how increasing $K$ affects net transcellular flux across the RPE when an efflux pump is present.

The setup is scientifically sound and provides a sufficient basis for a rigorous analysis. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe net flux across the RPE monolayer, $J_{net}$, can be expressed as the difference between the passive flux into the cell ($J_{passive}$) and the active efflux out of the cell back into the apical space ($J_{efflux}$) at the apical membrane. At steady state, this net flux must be constant throughout the cell layer.\n$$J_{net} = J_{passive} - J_{efflux}$$\n\n1.  **Passive Flux ($J_{passive}$)**: According to Fick's first law and the solubility-diffusion model, the permeability of a substance across a lipid membrane is proportional to its partition coefficient $K$. The flux is $J = P(C_{source} - C_{sink})$. Here, the driving concentration difference is $(C_a - C_b) \\approx C_a$. The overall transcellular permeability is proportional to $K$. The problem provides $P_m$ as a permeability coefficient that \"depends on membrane properties\" and $K$ as the partition coefficient. A consistent interpretation, supported by the phrasing in option A, is that the passive flux is given by:\n    $$J_{passive} = P_m K C_a$$\n    Here, $P_m$ represents the aspects of permeability independent of lipophilicity (e.g., related to $D_m$ and $L$), and the total passive permeation is correctly shown as proportional to $K$. This flux increases linearly with $K$.\n\n2.  **Efflux ($J_{efflux}$)**: The efflux is described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics:\n    $$J_{efflux} = \\frac{v_{max} \\cdot C_{substrate}}{K_m + C_{substrate}}$$\n    The problem directs us to approximate the substrate concentration, $C_{substrate}$, using the partitioning relation. The most reasonable interpretation, which views the transporter acting on the drug within the membrane leaflet, is that the relevant concentration is proportional to the external concentration $C_a$ via the partition coefficient $K$. Let's set $C_{substrate} = K C_a$. This is a strong assumption but is given by the problem.\n    $$J_{efflux}(K) = \\frac{v_{max} K C_a}{K_m + K C_a}$$\n\n3.  **Net Flux ($J_{net}$)**: Combining the two components gives the net flux as a function of $K$:\n    $$J_{net}(K) = P_m K C_a - \\frac{v_{max} K C_a}{K_m + K C_a}$$\n\nWe analyze the behavior of this function for different regimes of $K$:\n-   **Low $K$ regime ($K C_a \\ll K_m$)**: The denominator of the efflux term is approximately $K_m$.\n    $$J_{efflux} \\approx \\frac{v_{max} K C_a}{K_m}$$\n    The net flux is:\n    $$J_{net}(K) \\approx P_m K C_a - \\frac{v_{max}}{K_m} K C_a = \\left(P_m C_a - \\frac{v_{max} C_a}{K_m}\\right) K$$\n    In this regime, the net flux grows linearly with $K$. The slope can be positive, negative, or zero depending on the parameter values.\n\n-   **High $K$ regime ($K C_a \\gg K_m$)**: The efflux transporter is saturated. The denominator of the efflux term is approximately $K C_a$.\n    $$J_{efflux} \\approx \\frac{v_{max} K C_a}{K C_a} = v_{max}$$\n    The net flux is:\n    $$J_{net}(K) \\approx P_m K C_a - v_{max}$$\n    In this regime, the net flux grows asymptotically linearly with $K$, with a slope of $P_m C_a$ and a vertical intercept of $-v_{max}$.\n\nThe overall function $J_{net}(K)$ starts at $0$ for $K=0$ and transitions from one linear behavior (for small $K$) to another (for large $K$). The derivative $\\frac{dJ_{net}}{dK} = P_m C_a - \\frac{v_{max} K_m C_a}{(K_m + K C_a)^2}$ is an increasing function of $K$, which means the $J_{net}(K)$ curve is convex (concave up).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. As $K$ increases, the passive component of flux increases due to stronger membrane partitioning, but the intracellular concentration also rises, increasing the efflux rate. Consequently, the net flux initially grows sublinearly relative to purely passive expectations, and for sufficiently large $K$ (where the efflux saturates), the net flux approaches an asymptotically linear behavior described by $J_{net} \\approx P_m K C_a - v_{max}$.**\n-   The preliminary reasoning is correct: $J_{passive}$ increases with $K$, and $J_{efflux}$ also increases with $K$ (until saturation).\n-   The description of the asymptotic behavior for large $K$, $J_{net} \\approx P_m K C_a - v_{max}$, is precisely what our model predicts. This is a strong piece of evidence for the correctness of this option.\n-   The phrase \"initially grows sublinearly relative to purely passive expectations\" is linguistically imprecise. The initial growth is linear, $J_{net} \\approx C \\cdot K$, just with a smaller slope than the passive-only case. Mathematically, \"sublinear growth\" implies $f(x)=o(x)$, which is not the case here. However, in an applied science context, this phrase is likely used to mean that the growth rate is reduced compared to the passive case, and the function's graph lies below the line for purely passive transport. Given that the rest of the statement, particularly the asymptotic limit, is perfectly correct and captures the main physics, this imprecision can be seen as an unfortunate choice of words for an otherwise correct physical description.\n-   **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. The net flux is independent of $K$ because the efflux rate scales exactly linearly with $K$ for all $K$, perfectly canceling any increase in passive flux.**\n-   The premise that the efflux rate scales linearly with $K$ for all $K$ is false. The Michaelis-Menten expression shows that the efflux saturates at high $K$.\n-   The conclusion that the net flux is independent of $K$ is also false, as shown by our derived function $J_{net}(K)$.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. Increasing $K$ always decreases net flux, since lipophilic drugs are preferentially trapped in membranes and removed by efflux, making the passive component fall with increasing $K$.**\n-   The statement that the passive component falls with increasing $K$ contradicts the fundamental solubility-diffusion model, where permeability and passive flux increase with lipophilicity ($K$).\n-   The conclusion that net flux always decreases is also generally false. For large $K$, the net flux is dominated by the passive term and increases linearly with $K$.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. Increasing $K$ always causes net flux to increase without bound, and efflux pumps have no effect on neutral molecules because active transport requires ionization.**\n-   The first part, that net flux increases without bound as $K$ increases, is correct based on the asymptotic behavior $J_{net} \\approx P_m K C_a - v_{max}$.\n-   The second part, that efflux pumps have no effect on neutral molecules, is factually incorrect. Many important efflux transporters, including P-glycoprotein (P-gp), transport a wide variety of lipophilic neutral substrates. The problem explicitly sets up a scenario with a neutral drug and an active pump.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. If $v_{max} > P_m K C_a$ over a range of $K$, the efflux pump can overtake the passive component so that $J_{net} < 0$ (i.e., net movement is toward the apical side), but as $K$ increases further and the efflux saturates, the direction of net flux can switch to positive and grow approximately linearly with $K$ thereafter.**\n-   This option describes a specific scenario. Let's analyze if it is possible. Net flux is negative if $J_{passive} < J_{efflux}$:\n    $$P_m K C_a < \\frac{v_{max} K C_a}{K_m + K C_a}$$\n    Dividing by $P_m K C_a$ (for $K>0$):\n    $$1 < \\frac{v_{max} / P_m}{K_m + K C_a} \\implies K_m + K C_a < v_{max}/P_m$$\n    This inequality can hold for a range of small, positive $K$ values if the pump is sufficiently potent, specifically if $K_m < v_{max}/P_m$ or $v_{max} > P_m K_m$. This condition on the system parameters is physically plausible.\n-   If the flux is negative for small $K$, as $K$ increases, the passive term $P_m K C_a$ grows without bound, while the efflux term $J_{efflux}$ approaches a constant, $v_{max}$. Inevitably, the passive term will dominate, causing $J_{net}$ to cross zero and become positive.\n-   The subsequent growth will be \"approximately linearly with $K$,\" which matches our asymptotic analysis.\n-   Therefore, this statement correctly describes a valid and important potential behavior of the system.\n-   **Verdict**: Correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "4658868"}]}
