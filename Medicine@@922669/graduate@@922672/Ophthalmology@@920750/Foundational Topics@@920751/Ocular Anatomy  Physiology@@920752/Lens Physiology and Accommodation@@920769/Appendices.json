Accommodation increases the eye’s optical power via ciliary muscle contraction, making the crystalline lens more convex. In clinical and physiological optics, optical power is measured in diopters, where one diopter is defined as the reciprocal of focal length in meters. Treat the eye as a single thin optical system whose principal plane coincides with the corneal vertex, and use the vergence formulation in paraxial optics with air as the object space of refractive index $n = 1$.\n\nStarting from first principles (vergence addition and the condition for retinal conjugacy in an emmetropic eye), formally define the accommodative amplitude in diopters as a quantitative measure, and then derive the near point object distance (measured from the corneal vertex) for an eye whose distance refraction is emmetropia and whose accommodative amplitude equals $3\\,\\mathrm{D}$. Assume zero lag of accommodation and ignore depth-of-field and finite pupil size effects.\n\nRound your final distance to four significant figures and express it in centimeters. Your final numerical result must be a single real number.", "solution": "The analysis begins with the fundamental paraxial optics equation for a thin optical system, expressed in terms of vergence. The vergence-refraction equation, also known as the vergence form of the thin lens equation, is given by:\n$$L' = L + P$$\nHere, $L$ represents the object vergence, $P$ is the optical power of the system, and $L'$ is the image vergence. Vergence is defined as the ratio of the refractive index of the medium to the distance from a reference plane (in this case, the principal plane of the optical system). For an object in air with refractive index $n=1$ at a distance $l$ from the principal plane, the object vergence is $L = \\frac{1}{l}$. Similarly, for the image at a distance $l'$ in a medium of refractive index $n'$, the image vergence is $L' = \\frac{n'}{l'}$. All distances are measured in meters ($\\mathrm{m}$), and all vergences and powers are measured in diopters ($\\mathrm{D}$), where $1 \\, \\mathrm{D} = 1 \\, \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. By convention, distances for real objects to the left of the optical system are negative, and distances for real images to the right are positive.\n\nFor the human eye, the image must be focused on the retina. The distance from the principal plane to the retina, $l'_{retina}$, is fixed. The refractive index of the vitreous humor, $n'_{vit}$, is also constant. Therefore, the image vergence required for clear vision is a constant value for a given eye:\n$$L'_{retina} = \\frac{n'_{vit}}{l'_{retina}} = K$$\nwhere $K$ is a constant representing the ocular vergence requirement. The fundamental condition for the eye to be in focus is thus:\n$$K = L + P_{eye}$$\nwhere $P_{eye}$ is the total optical power of the eye, which can vary through accommodation.\n\nFirst, we analyze the unaccommodated (fully relaxed) emmetropic eye. An emmetropic eye is one that focuses parallel light from a distant object (at optical infinity) onto the retina without any accommodative effort.\nThe object distance for a distant object is $l \\to -\\infty$.\nThe corresponding object vergence is $L_{fp} = \\frac{1}{-\\infty} = 0 \\, \\mathrm{D}$. This defines the far point ($fp$) vergence.\nLet $P_{unacc}$ be the power of the unaccommodated eye. The focusing condition becomes:\n$$K = L_{fp} + P_{unacc} = 0 + P_{unacc}$$\nThus, for an emmetropic eye, its unaccommodated power is exactly equal to the required ocular vergence: $P_{unacc} = K$.\n\nNext, we analyze the fully accommodated eye. When the eye exerts its maximum accommodative effort, it is focused on its near point ($np$). Let the near point be at an object distance $l_{np}$ from the principal plane.\nThe object vergence for the near point is $L_{np} = \\frac{1}{l_{np}}$.\nLet $P_{acc}$ be the power of the fully accommodated eye. The focusing condition for the near point is:\n$$K = L_{np} + P_{acc}$$\n\nAccommodative amplitude, denoted by $A$, is formally defined as the maximum increase in the eye's optical power from the unaccommodated state to the fully accommodated state.\n$$A = P_{acc} - P_{unacc}$$\nWe can now substitute the expressions derived from the focusing conditions into this definition. From the near point condition, we have $P_{acc} = K - L_{np}$. From the far point condition for emmetropia, we have $P_{unacc} = K$.\nSubstituting these into the definition of $A$:\n$$A = (K - L_{np}) - K = -L_{np}$$\nThis is the formal definition of accommodative amplitude derived from first principles: the accommodative amplitude is equal to the negative of the object vergence of the near point.\n\nThe near point object *distance*, which we will denote as $d_{np}$, is the conventionally positive distance from the corneal vertex (our principal plane) to the near point. Following the sign convention, the object position is $l_{np} = -d_{np}$.\nThe near point vergence is therefore $L_{np} = \\frac{1}{l_{np}} = \\frac{1}{-d_{np}}$.\nSubstituting this into our definition of $A$:\n$$A = -L_{np} = -\\left(\\frac{1}{-d_{np}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{d_{np}}$$\nThis result shows that the accommodative amplitude in diopters is equal to the reciprocal of the near point distance measured in meters.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the near point object distance for an emmetropic eye with an accommodative amplitude of $A = 3 \\, \\mathrm{D}$.\nUsing the derived relationship:\n$$A = \\frac{1}{d_{np}}$$\nWe solve for the near point distance $d_{np}$:\n$$d_{np} = \\frac{1}{A}$$\nSubstituting the given value for $A$:\n$$d_{np} = \\frac{1}{3 \\, \\mathrm{D}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\, \\mathrm{m}$$\nThe problem asks for the distance to be expressed in centimeters ($\\mathrm{cm}$) and rounded to four significant figures.

Second, we apply this formula to the given numerical data for the two states of the lens and compute the change in power.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Thick Lens Power Formula**\n\nWe consider a centered optical system consisting of two spherical surfaces with radii of curvature $R_1$ and $R_2$, separated by a distance $t$ along the optical axis. The lens material has a refractive index $n_{\\ell}$, and it is immersed in a medium of refractive index $n_m$ on both sides. The equivalent power $F$ of an optical system is defined for a ray incident parallel to the optical axis at a height $y_1$. The ray emerges from the system with a final angle $\\alpha'$ relative to the axis. The power is then given by the relation $F = -\\frac{n_m \\alpha'}{y_1}$.\n\nLet's trace such a ray through the system.\n1.  **Refraction at the first surface (anterior, radius $R_1$)**:\n    An incident ray parallel to the axis ($\\alpha_1 = 0$) at height $y_1$ strikes the first surface. The paraxial refraction equation at an interface between media $n_a$ and $n_b$ is $n_b \\alpha_b = n_a \\alpha_a - y \\frac{n_b - n_a}{R}$.\n    Here, $n_a = n_m$, $n_b = n_{\\ell}$, $\\alpha_a = 0$, and the ray height is $y_1$. The angle of the ray inside the lens, $\\alpha_{\\ell}$, is given by:\n    $$n_{\\ell} \\alpha_{\\ell} = n_m (0) - y_1 \\frac{n_{\\ell} - n_m}{R_1}$$\n    The power of the first surface is $P_1 = \\frac{n_{\\ell} - n_m}{R_1}$. Thus:\n    $$n_{\\ell} \\alpha_{\\ell} = -y_1 P_1 \\implies \\alpha_{\\ell} = -\\frac{y_1 P_1}{n_{\\ell}}$$\n\n2.  **Propagation through the lens**:\n    The ray propagates a distance $t$ through the lens medium (refractive index $n_{\\ell}$). The height of the ray at the second surface, $y_2$, is given by the paraxial translation equation $y_{final} = y_{initial} + d \\cdot \\alpha$, where $d$ is the axial distance.\n    $$y_2 = y_1 + t \\alpha_{\\ell} = y_1 + t \\left(-\\frac{y_1 P_1}{n_{\\ell}}\\right) = y_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{t P_1}{n_{\\ell}}\\right)$$\n\n3.  **Refraction at the second surface (posterior, radius $R_2$)**:\n    The ray with angle $\\alpha_{\\ell}$ and height $y_2$ strikes the second surface. It refracts from the lens ($n_{\\ell}$) back into the surrounding medium ($n_m$). The final emergent angle is $\\alpha'$. The paraxial refraction equation is:\n    $$n_m \\alpha' = n_{\\ell} \\alpha_{\\ell} - y_2 \\frac{n_m - n_{\\ell}}{R_2}$$\n    The power of the second surface is $P_2 = \\frac{n_m - n_{\\ell}}{R_2}$. Substituting this, we get:\n    $$n_m \\alpha' = n_{\\ell} \\alpha_{\\ell} - y_2 P_2$$\n    Now, we substitute the expressions for $\\alpha_{\\ell}$ and $y_2$ from the previous steps:\n    $$n_m \\alpha' = n_{\\ell} \\left(-\\frac{y_1 P_1}{n_{\\ell}}\\right) - y_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{t P_1}{n_{\\ell}}\\right) P_2$$\n    $$n_m \\alpha' = -y_1 P_1 - y_1 P_2 + y_1 \\frac{t P_1 P_2}{n_{\\ell}}$$\n    $$n_m \\alpha' = -y_1 \\left(P_1 + P_2 - \\frac{t P_1 P_2}{n_{\\ell}}\\right)$$\n\n4.  **Equivalent Power**:\n    From the definition of equivalent power, $F = -\\frac{n_m \\alpha'}{y_1}$. Comparing this with the expression above, we find the formula for the equivalent power of the thick lens:\n    $$F = P_1 + P_2 - \\frac{t}{n_{\\ell}} P_1 P_2$$\n    This is Gullstrand's equation, which we have derived from first principles.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Change in Optical Power**\n\nWe are given the following parameters.
