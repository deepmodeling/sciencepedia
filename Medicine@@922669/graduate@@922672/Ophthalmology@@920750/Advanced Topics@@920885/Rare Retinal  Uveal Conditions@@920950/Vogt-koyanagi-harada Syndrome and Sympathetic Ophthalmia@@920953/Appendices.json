This exercise challenges you to act as the primary clinician, constructing a workup that maximizes diagnostic certainty while minimizing patient risk. You will apply principles of evidence-based medicine, implicitly using Bayesian reasoning to select tests with high diagnostic yield and strategically sequence them to confirm VKH while safely excluding critical mimics before initiating immunosuppressive therapy [@problem_id:4734806].", "problem": "A $32$-year-old woman presents with $3$ days of bilateral blurred vision, photophobia, and a diffuse headache with neck stiffness. Examination reveals bilateral granulomatous anterior uveitis, vitritis, and multifocal neurosensory retinal elevations consistent with serous (exudative) detachments. There is no history of ocular trauma or surgery. She reports transient tinnitus but denies rash; skin appears normal without vitiligo or alopecia. You suspect Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH), but you wish to achieve high diagnostic confidence while minimizing invasive procedures and simultaneously excluding common mimics such as sympathetic ophthalmia (SO), sarcoidosis, syphilitic uveitis, and tuberculosis.\n\nFundamental base for reasoning:\n- Diagnostic testing is governed by Bayes’ theorem, which updates a prior probability to a posterior probability through likelihood ratios. If a test has a positive likelihood ratio $LR_+$, the posterior odds equal prior odds multiplied by $LR_+$, where odds $= p/(1-p)$ for probability $p$.\n- Well-tested facts in uveitis imaging and laboratory medicine indicate that certain modalities are highly sensitive to choroidal inflammation in VKH: indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), fluorescein angiography (FA), enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT), and ocular ultrasonography (B-scan). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytic pleocytosis early in VKH is supportive but requires lumbar puncture, which is invasive.\n- Exclusion of mimics relies on noninvasive or minimally invasive tests, including serologic screening for syphilis and tuberculosis, and evaluation for sarcoidosis via chest imaging and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level.\n\nYou must select the testing bundle and sequence that, starting from a reasonable VKH pretest probability in this clinical context, is expected to produce the greatest increase in posterior probability for VKH while keeping invasiveness low and reasonably excluding major mimics. The bundle should justify sequencing by prioritizing high-yield, low-risk tests that are sensitive to choroidal inflammation and exudative detachments, then selectively adding tests that refine specificity or exclude alternatives. Consider the following plausible approximations for test characteristics in early VKH under typical clinical conditions (values are provided to anchor reasoning but are not exhaustive nor absolute): ICGA for hypocyanescent choroidal dark dots and patchy hypofluorescence $LR_+ \\approx 6$–$10$, FA for multiple pinpoint leaks with subretinal pooling $LR_+ \\approx 4$–$6$, EDI-OCT for diffuse choroidal thickening and subretinal fluid $LR_+ \\approx 3$–$5$, ocular B-scan for choroidal thickening $LR_+ \\approx 3$, CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis $LR_+ \\approx 4$–$6$ but with invasive risk, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain/orbits for meningeal enhancement $LR_+ \\approx 2$–$3$, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR4 association $LR_+ \\approx 1.5$–$2$ (limited diagnostic value).\n\nWhich of the following lab/imaging bundles with the proposed sequence best meets the goal?\n\nA. Same-day ocular imaging focused on choroid and RPE: enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT), fluorescein angiography (FA), and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), plus ocular B-scan if media are hazy; concurrently order noninvasive exclusion labs (treponemal and non-treponemal syphilis serologies, interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis, serum ACE and chest radiograph for sarcoidosis). Defer magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to patients with persistent neurologic signs; avoid lumbar puncture unless atypical course or low confidence after ocular imaging. Initiate high-dose corticosteroid therapy promptly once imaging supports VKH.\n\nB. Prioritize central nervous system work-up: immediate MRI of brain and orbits followed by lumbar puncture for CSF analysis; delay ocular angiographies until after CSF results; add HLA typing for DR4 and defer infectious screening. Begin corticosteroids only after CSF pleocytosis is confirmed.\n\nC. Minimize testing by relying on therapeutic response: initiate high-dose corticosteroids immediately and reassess after $48$–$72$ hours; order optical coherence tomography (OCT) without enhanced depth imaging; avoid angiography; add HLA typing and defer infectious work-up unless steroid response is poor.\n\nD. Aggressive tissue diagnosis: schedule early diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous cytology and microculture; obtain FA but omit ICGA; defer EDI-OCT; begin corticosteroids only after pathology excludes infectious etiologies.\n\nSelect the best option and be prepared to defend the proposed sequence using Bayes’ theorem, test likelihood ratios, and principles of minimizing invasiveness while maximizing diagnostic confidence for VKH and appropriately excluding mimics such as sympathetic ophthalmia.", "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It presents a realistic clinical scenario in ophthalmology, provides a sound theoretical framework for diagnostic reasoning based on Bayes' theorem and likelihood ratios, and offers plausible, albeit simplified, data for test characteristics. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, asking for the optimal diagnostic strategy by balancing diagnostic yield, invasiveness, and the need to exclude critical alternative diagnoses.\n\nThe goal is to select the testing bundle and sequence that maximizes the posterior probability of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH) while minimizing risk and excluding key mimics. The diagnostic process is guided by Bayes' theorem, where the post-test odds of a disease are the pre-test odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio ($LR$) of the test. A positive test with a high positive likelihood ratio ($LR_+$) significantly increases the probability of the disease.\n\nThe provided approximate $LR_+$ values for tests in early VKH are:\n- Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA): $LR_+ \\approx 6-10$\n- Fluorescein angiography (FA): $LR_+ \\approx 4-6$\n- Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytic pleocytosis: $LR_+ \\approx 4-6$\n- Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT): $LR_+ \\approx 3-5$\n- Ocular B-scan ultrasonography: $LR_+ \\approx 3$\n- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain/orbits: $LR_+ \\approx 2-3$\n- Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR4: $LR_+ \\approx 1.5-2$\n\nA rational diagnostic strategy must prioritize tests with high $LR_+$ values while considering their invasiveness. Non-invasive or minimally invasive tests should precede invasive ones. Furthermore, before initiating high-dose corticosteroid therapy, which is the standard of care for VKH, it is imperative to exclude infectious mimics like syphilis and tuberculosis, as immunosuppression can lead to devastating consequences in the presence of untreated infection. The patient's history of no ocular trauma or surgery makes sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) less likely, as it is classically post-traumatic or post-surgical, but the clinical and imaging findings can be identical to VKH, so a high degree of confidence in the VKH diagnosis is still required.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Same-day ocular imaging focused on choroid and RPE: enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT), fluorescein angiography (FA), and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), plus ocular B-scan if media are hazy; concurrently order noninvasive exclusion labs (treponemal and non-treponemal syphilis serologies, interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis, serum ACE and chest radiograph for sarcoidosis). Defer magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to patients with persistent neurologic signs; avoid lumbar puncture unless atypical course or low confidence after ocular imaging. Initiate high-dose corticosteroid therapy promptly once imaging supports VKH.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This option proposes a bundle of the most powerful and specific imaging tests for VKH. ICGA has the highest $LR_+$ ($6-10$), followed by FA ($4-6$), and EDI-OCT ($3-5$). Using these tests in combination provides a multiplicative effect on the likelihood ratio, dramatically increasing the posterior probability of VKH. For instance, assuming independent findings, the combined $LR_+$ could be in the range of $(6 \\times 4 \\times 3) = 72$ or higher, which would convert even a moderate pre-test probability into near certainty. These tests are minimally invasive (intravenous dye injection). Concurrently, it addresses the critical need to exclude mimics (syphilis, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis) using standard, low-risk tests (blood work, chest X-ray). This safety-conscious step is essential before starting immunosuppression. The strategy correctly defers invasive procedures like lumbar puncture (LP) and lower-yield imaging like MRI, reserving them for cases where the diagnosis remains uncertain after the initial, high-yield work-up. This approach allows for a rapid, confident diagnosis and prompt initiation of vision-saving therapy.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**. This strategy is clinically sound, logically sequenced, and aligns perfectly with the principles of maximizing diagnostic certainty while minimizing patient risk.\n\n**B. Prioritize central nervous system work-up: immediate MRI of brain and orbits followed by lumbar puncture for CSF analysis; delay ocular angiographies until after CSF results; add HLA typing for DR4 and defer infectious screening. Begin corticosteroids only after CSF pleocytosis is confirmed.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This approach is suboptimal and flawed for several reasons. First, it prioritizes tests with lower or equivalent diagnostic yield (MRI with $LR_+ \\approx 2-3$; CSF with $LR_+ \\approx 4-6$) over ocular imaging modalities that are more sensitive and specific for the choroiditis of VKH (ICGA with $LR_+ \\approx 6-10$). Second, it mandates an invasive lumbar puncture as a primary diagnostic step, which contradicts the goal of minimizing invasiveness, especially when less invasive tests are more powerful. Third, deferring infectious screening is dangerous, as it creates a risk of inappropriately treating an infection with corticosteroids. Fourth, adding HLA typing is of very limited clinical utility for diagnosis in an individual patient due to its low $LR_+$ ($1.5-2$). Finally, delaying treatment until CSF results are available unnecessarily postpones vision-saving therapy.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This sequence is illogical, unnecessarily invasive, and unsafe.\n\n**C. Minimize testing by relying on therapeutic response: initiate high-dose corticosteroids immediately and reassess after $48$–$72$ hours; order optical coherence tomography (OCT) without enhanced depth imaging; avoid angiography; add HLA typing and defer infectious work-up unless steroid response is poor.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This is a reckless and dangerous approach. Initiating high-dose corticosteroids without a confirmed diagnosis and without excluding infectious etiologies like syphilis or tuberculosis is a major violation of standard medical practice. Such a course of action could lead to fulminant infection and catastrophic outcomes. Relying on a \"therapeutic response\" is unreliable, as many inflammatory conditions respond to steroids, making it a non-specific diagnostic marker. Using standard OCT without EDI, and avoiding angiography, jettisons the most valuable diagnostic tools. This strategy fails to achieve high diagnostic confidence and puts the patient at significant risk.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This approach is diagnostically weak and clinically unsafe.\n\n**D. Aggressive tissue diagnosis: schedule early diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous cytology and microculture; obtain FA but omit ICGA; defer EDI-OCT; begin corticosteroids only after pathology excludes infectious etiologies.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This option recommends an extremely invasive procedure, a diagnostic vitrectomy, as a near-primary step. This is a major intraocular surgery with significant risks (e.g., cataract, retinal detachment, endophthalmitis) and is reserved for complex or atypical cases where less invasive methods have failed to yield a diagnosis. In a patient with a classic presentation of VKH, this is gross overtreatment. The primary pathology in VKH is a choroiditis, and a vitrectomy samples the vitreous, which may show non-specific inflammation but will miss the key choroidal findings. Omitting ICGA and EDI-OCT is a critical error, as these are the most sensitive tests for detecting the pathognomonic choroidal inflammation. Delaying treatment until culture results are available (which can take days to weeks) would result in an unacceptable delay and likely lead to permanent vision loss.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This strategy is excessively invasive, diagnostically misguided, and causes harmful delays in treatment.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A represents the most logical, effective, and safe pathway. It prioritizes high-yield, minimally invasive tests to confirm the diagnosis of VKH, while simultaneously and responsibly excluding critical mimics before initiating appropriate therapy.

This practice reinforces the link between a quantitative measurement from Enhanced Depth Imaging Optical Coherence Tomography (EDI-OCT) and the underlying pathophysiology of choroidal inflammation.

Using the fundamental definition of a relative (percent) increase, where the percent increase $p$ is defined as the ratio of the increment to the baseline, $p = \\dfrac{\\text{new} - \\text{baseline}}{\\text{baseline}}$, compute $p$ for this patient. Express the percent increase as a decimal fraction (for example, write $0.25$ to represent twenty-five percent), and give your answer exactly without rounding. Briefly interpret the magnitude of $p$ in terms of disease activity based on the well-established observation that acute VKH is characterized by diffuse choroidal thickening due to granulomatous inflammation, as assessed by EDI-OCT. The final numerical answer must be a single real-valued number without a percent sign.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation and interpretation of the relative increase in subfoveal choroidal thickness in a patient with suspected acute Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome.\n\nFirst, the given parameters are identified.\nThe baseline subfoveal choroidal thickness, corresponding to a healthy state, is given as $T_{\\text{baseline}} = 300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe measured subfoveal choroidal thickness in the patient with acute VKH is $T_{\\text{new}} = 720\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe problem provides the explicit formula for the relative increase, denoted by $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{T_{\\text{new}} - T_{\\text{baseline}}}{T_{\\text{baseline}}}$$\nThis formula defines the relative increase as the ratio of the absolute change in thickness to the original, baseline thickness.\n\nTo compute $p$, we substitute the given numerical values into the formula:\n$$p = \\frac{720\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} - 300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, which represents the absolute increase in thickness:\n$$T_{\\text{new}} - T_{\\text{baseline}} = 720\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} - 300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 420\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nNext, we divide this increment by the baseline thickness:\n$$p = \\frac{420\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}$$\nThe units of micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) in the numerator and denominator cancel, yielding a dimensionless quantity, as expected for a relative increase.\n$$p = \\frac{420}{300}$$\n\nThis fraction can be simplified.

We perform the division:\n$$p = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4$$\nThis value represents the relative increase. To express it as a percentage, one would multiply by $100$, resulting in a $140\\%$ increase. The problem, however, asks for the decimal fraction itself.\n\nFinally, an interpretation of the magnitude of $p$ is required. The value $p = 1.4$ signifies that the choroidal thickness has increased by $140\\%$ relative to the normal baseline. This is a very large increase, indicating that the choroid has more than doubled in thickness (specifically, its new thickness is $1 + 1.4 = 2.4$ times the baseline thickness). In the clinical context of VKH syndrome, choroidal thickness is a key biomarker for disease activity. The acute, exudative phase of VKH is characterized by a diffuse granulomatous inflammation of the choroid, leading to significant thickening from the inflammatory infiltrate and associated serous fluid accumulation. A measured increase of this magnitude ($140\\%$) is highly indicative of severe, active inflammation consistent with the acute stage of the disease.

The goal is to construct a monitoring protocol using serial Enhanced Depth Imaging Optical Coherence Tomography (EDI-OCT), which captures subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and macular status, to guide safe tapering of corticosteroids while minimizing relapse risk. The following fundamental bases apply: inflammation-driven choroidal expansion in VKH elevates SFCT; corticosteroids suppress inflammatory cytokine cascades, leading to progressive reduction of SFCT; EDI-OCT SFCT exhibits diurnal and measurement variability on the order of approximately $10$ to $30$ micrometers, which is relatively small compared with the pathologic thickening in acute VKH (commonly several hundred micrometers). Let baseline SFCT be $T_0$ at treatment initiation.

Inflammation-driven choroidal expansion elevates subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT).\n- **Treatment**: High-dose systemic corticosteroids.\n- **Treatment Effect**: Corticosteroids suppress inflammatory cytokine cascades, leading to progressive reduction of SFCT.\n- **Monitoring Method**: Enhanced Depth Imaging Optical Coherence Tomography (EDI-OCT) to measure SFCT and macular status.\n- **Monitoring Goal**: Guide safe tapering of corticosteroids while minimizing relapse risk.\n- **Measurement Characteristics**: EDI-OCT SFCT has diurnal and measurement variability of approximately $10$ to $30$ micrometers. This is noted to be small compared to the pathologic thickening in acute VKH (commonly several hundred micrometers).\n- **Mathematical/Conceptual Model**:\n    - Baseline SFCT at treatment initiation is $T_0$.\n    - SFCT evolution under effective therapy is approximated by a monotone decay, $T(t)$, with $dT/dt \\le 0$ in the early phase.\n    - A conceptual exponential model is given: $T(t) = T_0 e^{-k t}$ with $k > 0$.\n    - The decay curve transitions toward a plateau as inflammation remits.\n- **Key Decision-Making Principles**:\n    1.  Distinguish true biological change from noise.\n    2.  Require confirmation of changes across consecutive visits.\n    3.  Control for time-of-day effects.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement describes a realistic clinical scenario in ophthalmology.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The description of VKH, its pathophysiology (choroidal thickening), treatment with corticosteroids, and monitoring with EDI-OCT to measure SFCT are all standard and factual within contemporary ophthalmology. The concept of inflammation-driven choroidal thickening and its reduction with steroids is a cornerstone of managing this disease.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem asks to select the best protocol from a list of options based on a set of clearly defined principles. The principles (control for noise, confirm trends, logical tapering criteria) provide a solid framework for evaluation. The question is structured to have a single best answer among the choices.\n- **Objective**: The language is clinical and objective. The provided principles are based on established biostatistical and clinical reasoning (e.g., accounting for measurement error and biological variability).\n- **Consistency and Completeness**: The problem provides sufficient information to assess the options. The givens are internally consistent. The known measurement variability ($10$ to $30$ micrometers) is crucial context for evaluating the significance of measured changes and the need for confirmatory measurements. The conceptual model of decay and plateau provides a clear picture of the expected therapeutic response.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated, scientifically sound problem that requires the application of the provided principles to evaluate different clinical management strategies. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Optimal Protocol\nAn appropriate monitoring protocol must integrate all the given principles. Let's synthesize these into a set of requirements for an ideal protocol:\n1.  **Measurement Scheduling**: Measurements must be taken at consistent times to control for diurnal variation (a key principle stated in the problem). The frequency should be sufficient to capture the rapid initial response to high-dose steroids (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly), transitioning to less frequent as the condition stabilizes.\n2.  **Noise Robustness**: Decisions, especially to taper medication, must not be based on a single measurement. The protocol must require confirmation over at least two consecutive visits to ensure a change is real and not just measurement noise or a one-time fluctuation.\n3.  **Tapering Initiation Criteria**: Tapering should only begin when there is clear evidence of a controlled and stabilized inflammatory state. This requires a dual condition:\n    a.  A significant reduction in SFCT from the highly inflamed baseline ($T_0$).\n    b.  Evidence of quiescence, defined as the SFCT reaching a 'plateau' (i.e., minimal change between recent visits).\n4.  **Holistic Assessment**: The decision should not be based on SFCT alone. It must be integrated with other critical clinical signs, particularly the absence of exudative activity (e.g., no subretinal or intraretinal fluid) and stable or improving function (visual acuity).\n5.  **Relapse Detection**: The protocol must include sensitive criteria for detecting a relapse, which would manifest as a significant *increase* in SFCT from its lowest point (nadir) or the recurrence of fluid. To avoid over-reacting to noise, this detection should also ideally be confirmed.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Measure SFCT by EDI-OCT every $7$ days at variable clinic times; reduce corticosteroid dose by $25\\%$ whenever a single visit shows an SFCT decrease of at least $15\\%$ relative to $T_0$, provided there is no subretinal fluid on that visit.**\n- **Analysis**: This protocol has multiple flaws. Measuring at \"variable clinic times\" directly contradicts the principle of controlling for time-of-day effects. The decision to taper is based on a \"single visit\", which violates the principle of confirming changes to distinguish them from noise. Tapering based only on a decrease without waiting for a plateau represents a risk of reducing treatment while inflammation is still highly active, just responsive. The taper is aggressive ($25\\%$).\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**B. Measure SFCT by EDI-OCT every $7$ to $10$ days at a consistent morning time; initiate taper by $10$ to $20\\%$ only after two consecutive visits demonstrate (i) an SFCT decrease of at least $20\\%$ relative to $T_0$, and (ii) plateau behavior defined by a relative change of less than $5\\%$ between the two visits, with no intraretinal or subretinal fluid and stable or improved best-corrected visual acuity; pause taper and reassess if SFCT increases by $10\\%$ or more from the nadir on two consecutive visits or if new fluid appears.**\n- **Analysis**: This protocol systematically incorporates all the required principles.\n    1.  **Measurement Scheduling**: \"every $7$ to $10$ days at a consistent morning time\" is an ideal schedule for the acute phase, controlling for diurnal variation.\n    2.  **Noise Robustness**: Decisions to taper and to pause taper are based on findings from \"two consecutive visits\", which effectively filters out noise.\n    3.  **Tapering Initiation Criteria**: The criteria are comprehensive and safe. It requires both a significant initial response (at least $20\\%$ reduction from $T_0$) and stabilization (plateau with $<5\\%$ change). The taper is cautious ($10\\%$ to $20\\%$).\n    4.  **Holistic Assessment**: It correctly includes the anatomical requirement (\"no intraretinal or subretinal fluid\") and functional requirement (\"stable or improved best-corrected visual acuity\").\n    5.  **Relapse Detection**: The rule to pause taper (\"SFCT increases by $10\\%$ or more from the nadir on two consecutive visits or if new fluid appears\") is robust and sensitive, again using two visits to confirm the SFCT trend.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**C. Measure SFCT by EDI-OCT monthly; taper by $20\\%$ after any single monthly visit with an SFCT reduction of at least $5\\%$ from $T_0$, even if low-volume subretinal fluid persists, and reverse the taper only if visual acuity declines by at least $2$ lines.**\n- **Analysis**: This protocol is unsafe and violates multiple principles. \"monthly\" measurements are too infrequent to manage the acute phase of VKH. A \"$5\\%$ reduction\" could easily be measurement noise and is not a sufficient indicator of control. Tapering while subretinal fluid persists is a major clinical error, as it indicates ongoing active disease. Making decisions on a \"single monthly visit\" is unreliable. Reversing taper only after a significant decline in visual acuity is a dangerously late endpoint; the goal is to prevent such functional loss by responding to earlier, anatomical signs of relapse.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. Measure SFCT by EDI-OCT every $7$ days; taper by $30\\%$ when SFCT drops below an absolute threshold of $350$ micrometers at a single visit, regardless of the relative change from $T_0$, if no subretinal fluid is present; reverse taper if SFCT exceeds $350$ micrometers on the next visit.**\n- **Analysis**: This protocol's reliance on \"a single visit\" for both tapering and reversing the taper makes it highly susceptible to measurement variability, potentially leading to erratic treatment changes. An absolute threshold like \"$350$ micrometers\" is not individualized; a patient's normal, healthy SFCT can vary, so for some this value may still be highly pathological. It ignores the principle of waiting for a plateau, potentially leading to tapering during a rapid, but still incomplete, response. The taper of $30\\%$ is aggressive.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. Measure SFCT by EDI-OCT every $14$ days at consistent times; initiate taper when two consecutive visits show a relative change of less than $5\\%$ (plateau), regardless of absolute SFCT magnitude or percentage reduction from $T_0$, as long as subretinal fluid is absent; reverse taper only if SFCT increases by $25\\%$ from the nadir on one visit.**\n- **Analysis**: This protocol correctly identifies the need for a plateau confirmed over two visits and control of measurement time. However, its primary tapering criterion is critically flawed. Initiating a taper \"regardless of absolute SFCT magnitude or percentage reduction from $T_0$\" is dangerous. The choroid could plateau at a still very thick, pathological level (e.g., reducing from $900 \\mu m$ to a plateau at $700 \\mu m$), indicating a suboptimal response to the current dose. Tapering in this situation would be premature. Furthermore, the relapse criterion relies on a single visit (\"on one visit\"), which violates the noise-reduction principle.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4734838"}]}
