The core principle is that the power of a corrective lens changes when its distance from the eye changes. The effective power of a spectacle lens at the corneal plane is calculated using the vertex distance correction formula.\n\nThe formula for the effective power at the cornea, $P_{\\text{cornea}}$, of a spectacle lens with power $P_{\\text{spec}}$ at a vertex distance $d$ is:\n$$P_{\\text{cornea}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{spec}}}{1 - d \\cdot P_{\\text{spec}}}$$\nThis calculation must be performed separately for each principal meridian. The vertex distance must be in meters for consistency with diopters ($\\mathrm{D}$), which are inverse meters ($\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$).\n\n**Step 1: Determine the spectacle power in the principal meridians.**\nThe given manifest refraction is $-4.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$ sphere / $-2.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$ cylinder at axis $180^{\\circ}$.\nThe power along the axis meridian ($180^{\\circ}$) is the spherical power.\n$$P_{\\text{spec}, 180^{\\circ}} = -4.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$$\nThe power along the meridian perpendicular to the axis ($180^{\\circ} + 90^{\\circ} = 270^{\\circ}$, which is equivalent to $90^{\\circ}$) is the sum of the spherical and cylindrical powers.\n$$P_{\\text{spec}, 90^{\\circ}} = -4.00 \\ \\mathrm{D} + (-2.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}) = -6.00 \\ \\mathrm{D}$$\n\n**Step 2: Apply the vertex correction formula for each meridian.**\nThe vertex distance is $d = 12 \\ \\mathrm{mm} = 0.012 \\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nFor the $180^{\\circ}$ meridian:\n$$P_{\\text{cornea}, 180^{\\circ}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{spec}, 180^{\\circ}}}{1 - d \\cdot P_{\\text{spec}, 180^{\\circ}}} = \\frac{-4.00}{1 - (0.012)(-4.00)} = \\frac{-4.00}{1 + 0.048} = \\frac{-4.00}{1.048}$$\n$$P_{\\text{cornea}, 180^{\\circ}} \\approx -3.8167938... \\ \\mathrm{D}$$\nThis value represents the refractive error at the corneal plane in the horizontal meridian.\n\nFor the $90^{\\circ}$ meridian:\n$$P_{\\text{cornea}, 90^{\\circ}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{spec}, 90^{\\circ}}}{1 - d \\cdot P_{\\text{spec}, 90^{\\circ}}} = \\frac{-6.00}{1 - (0.012)(-6.00)} = \\frac{-6.00}{1 + 0.072} = \\frac{-6.00}{1.072}$$\n$$P_{\\text{cornea}, 90^{\\circ}} \\approx -5.5970149... \\ \\mathrm{D}$$\nThis value represents the refractive error at the corneal plane in the vertical meridian.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the required reduction in keratometric power.**\nTo neutralize the myopia (a condition where the eye's power is too strong), the corneal power must be reduced.
