It is a well-defined physics problem applied to a relevant clinical context.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe refractive power, $P$, of a single spherical surface separating two media with refractive indices $n_1$ and $n_2$ is given by the lensmaker's equation for a single surface:\n$$ P = \\frac{n_2 - n_1}{r} $$\nwhere $r$ is the radius of curvature of the surface. For the power $P$ to be in units of diopters ($D$), the radius $r$ must be expressed in meters ($m$), as $1\\,D = 1\\,m^{-1}$.\n\nIn this problem, the light travels from air ($n_1 = n_a$) into the cornea ($n_2 = n_c$). The power of the anterior corneal surface, $P_{cornea}$, is therefore:\n$$ P_{cornea} = \\frac{n_c - n_a}{r} $$\nWe are given the value for the difference in refractive indices, $n_c - n_a = 0.376$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial power of the corneal surface, $P_{initial}$, before the Orthokeratology treatment. The initial radius is $r_{initial} = 7.80\\,\\text{mm}$, which must be converted to meters:\n$$ r_{initial} = 7.80\\,\\text{mm} = 7.80 \\times 10^{-3}\\,m $$\nThe initial power is:\n$$ P_{initial} = \\frac{n_c - n_a}{r_{initial}} = \\frac{0.376}{7.80 \\times 10^{-3}\\,m} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the final power of the corneal surface, $P_{final}$, after the treatment. The treatment increases the radius of curvature (flattens the cornea) to $r_{final} = 8.00\\,\\text{mm}$:\n$$ r_{final} = 8.00\\,\\text{mm} = 8.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,m $$\nThe final power is:\n$$ P_{final} = \\frac{n_c - n_a}{r_{final}} = \\frac{0.376}{8.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,m} $$\n\nThe change in the anterior surface power, $\\Delta P$, is the difference between the final and initial powers:\n$$ \\Delta P = P_{final} - P_{initial} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for power:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{n_c - n_a}{r_{final}} - \\frac{n_c - n_a}{r_{initial}} $$\nFactoring out the common term $(n_c - n_a)$:\n$$ \\Delta P = (n_c - n_a) \\left( \\frac{1}{r_{final}} - \\frac{1}{r_{initial}} \\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$ \\Delta P = 0.376 \\left( \\frac{1}{8.00 \\times 10^{-3}} - \\frac{1}{7.80 \\times 10^{-3}} \\right) $$\nCalculating the terms inside the parentheses:\n$$ \\frac{1}{8.00 \\times 10^{-3}} = 125.0\\,m^{-1} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{7.80 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 128.205128\\,m^{-1} $$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $\\Delta P$:\n$$ \\Delta P \\approx 0.376 \\times (125.0 - 128.205128) $$\n$$ \\Delta P \\approx 0.376 \\times (-3.205128) $$\n$$ \\Delta P \\approx -1.205128\\,D $$\n\nThe problem states to neglect all other optical components of the eye. In this simplified model, the total refractive change of the eye is equal to the change in power of the anterior corneal surface. A myopic eye has excessive positive power. The calculated change in power, $\\Delta P$, is negative, which signifies a reduction in the eye's total power. This reduction in power corresponds to the reduction in myopia.\n\nThe question asks for the magnitude of the myopia reduction. This is the absolute value of the change in power:\n$$ \\text{Myopia Reduction} = |\\Delta P| \\approx |-1.205128\\,D| = 1.205128\\,D $$\nFinally, the answer must be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ 1.205128\\,D \\approx 1.21\\,D $$\nThe magnitude of the myopia reduction is $1.21$ diopters.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1.21} $$", "id": "4707259"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the optical changes, understanding the biomechanical response of the corneal epithelium is crucial for mastering orthokeratology.
