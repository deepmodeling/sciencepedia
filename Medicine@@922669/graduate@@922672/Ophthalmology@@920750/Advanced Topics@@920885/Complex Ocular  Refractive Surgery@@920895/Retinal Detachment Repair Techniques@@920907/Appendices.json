Consider the following physiologic and physical bases:\n\n- The intravitreal gas bubble behaves as an ideal gas so that, at fixed temperature, the bubble volume scales with the total number of moles via the ideal gas law $PV = nRT$.\n- At physiologic conditions, the surrounding ocular fluids are equilibrated with air such that the dominant poorly soluble inert component is nitrogen with a partial pressure approximating that of atmospheric air. Gas exchange across the gas–liquid interface is governed by Henry’s law, $C = k_{H} P$, where $C$ is the dissolved concentration, $P$ is the gas partial pressure above the solution, and $k_{H}$ is the Henry’s law constant for the gas–solvent pair.\n- Clinically validated gas expansion factors incorporate the coupled diffusion of nitrogen into the bubble and oxygen out of the bubble under normobaric conditions at body temperature. A mixture of $20\\%$ $SF_6$ in air is considered nonexpansile, that is, after equilibration at constant ambient pressure and temperature it maintains its initial volume (gas expansion factor of $1$).\n\nAssume the surgeon injects a bubble of total initial volume $V_{i} = 0.500~\\text{mL}$ composed of $20\\%$ $SF_6$ in air at $37^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ in a closed globe.

However, it also provides a critical piece of empirical, clinical information: \"A mixture of $20\\%$ $SF_6$ in air is considered nonexpansile, that is, after equilibration at constant ambient pressure and temperature it maintains its initial volume (gas expansion factor of $1$).\"\n\nThis statement provides a direct path to the solution for the first part. A nonexpansile gas mixture is, by definition, one where the net flux of gases across the bubble interface (primarily nitrogen diffusing in and the injected gas diffusing out) results in no net change in the bubble's volume at equilibrium. The complex interplay of partial pressures and solubilities, described conceptually by the ideal gas and Henry's laws, leads to this specific outcome for this particular mixture composition.\n\nThe initial volume of the injected bubble is given as $V_i = 0.500~\\text{mL}$.\nSince the gas mixture is defined as nonexpansile, its volume does not change upon reaching equilibrium with the surrounding physiological environment. Therefore, the final stabilized volume $V_f$ must be equal to the initial injected volume $V_i$.\n\n$$V_f = V_i$$\n$$V_f = 0.500~\\text{mL}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to three significant figures, which the given value $0.500~\\text{mL}$ already satisfies.\n\n**2) Determination of the Maximum Safe Injected Gas Volume, $\\Delta V_{\\text{safe}}$**\n\nThe second part of the problem requires us to calculate the maximum volume of gas that can be injected into a sealed globe without causing the intraocular pressure (IOP) to exceed a specified limit.\n\nThe problem provides a linear model for the globe's pressure-volume relationship:\n$$\\Delta V \\approx C \\, \\Delta P$$\nwhere $\\Delta V$ is the change in intraocular volume, $\\Delta P$ is the corresponding change in IOP, and $C$ is the ocular compliance.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Baseline IOP: $P_0 = 15~\\text{mmHg}$\n- Maximum allowable IOP: $P_{\\max} = 25~\\text{mmHg}$\n- Ocular compliance: $C = 0.005~\\text{mL}/\\text{mmHg}$\n\nThe maximum permissible change in IOP, $\\Delta P_{\\max}$, is the difference between the maximum allowable pressure and the baseline pressure:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\max} = P_{\\max} - P_0$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\max} = 25~\\text{mmHg} - 15~\\text{mmHg} = 10~\\text{mmHg}$$\n\nThe maximum safe injected volume, $\\Delta V_{\\text{safe}}$, is the volume change $\\Delta V$ that produces this maximum pressure change $\\Delta P_{\\max}$. Using the compliance relationship:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{safe}} = C \\cdot \\Delta P_{\\max}$$\nSubstituting the values for $C$ and $\\Delta P_{\\max}$:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{safe}} = (0.005~\\text{mL}/\\text{mmHg}) \\cdot (10~\\text{mmHg})$$\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{safe}} = 0.05~\\text{mL}$$\n\nThe problem requires this answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
