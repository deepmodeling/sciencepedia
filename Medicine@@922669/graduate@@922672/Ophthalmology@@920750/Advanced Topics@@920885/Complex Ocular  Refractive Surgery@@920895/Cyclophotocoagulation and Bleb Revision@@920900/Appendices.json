The analysis proceeds from fundamental principles of heat transfer.\n\nThe governing equation for heat conduction is derived from the principle of conservation of energy. In one dimension, the rate of change of thermal energy per unit volume is balanced by the net rate of heat flow into that volume. Let $T(x,t)$ be the temperature as a function of position $x$ and time $t$, $\\rho$ be the mass density, and $c$ be the specific heat capacity. The rate of change of internal energy density is $\\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$.\n\nThe heat flux, $q(x,t)$, is described by Fourier's law of heat conduction:\n$$q = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}$$\nwhere $k$ is the thermal conductivity. The negative sign indicates that heat flows from higher to lower temperatures.\n\nThe conservation of energy in a differential volume element requires that the rate of change of internal energy equals the negative divergence of the heat flux. In one dimension, this is:\n$$\\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x}$$\nSubstituting Fourier's law into the energy conservation equation yields:\n$$\\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right)$$\nAssuming the material properties $\\rho$, $c$, and $k$ are uniform, we obtain the one-dimensional heat equation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{k}{\\rho c} \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}$$\nWe define the thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha$, as $\\alpha = \\frac{k}{\\rho c}$. The heat equation is then:\n$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}$$\nThe problem states that the sclera is modeled as a slab of thickness $L$ with its faces at $x=0$ and $x=L$ held at a constant baseline temperature. We can define $T(x,t)$ as the temperature elevation above this baseline. Thus, the boundary conditions are:\n$$T(0, t) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad T(L, t) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } t > 0$$\nWe solve this partial differential equation using the method of separation of variables. We seek solutions of the form $T(x,t) = X(x)\\Theta(t)$. Substituting this into the heat equation gives:\n$$X(x)\\frac{d\\Theta(t)}{dt} = \\alpha \\Theta(t)\\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2}$$\nDividing by $\\alpha X(x)\\Theta(t)$ separates the variables:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\alpha \\Theta(t)}\\frac{d\\Theta(t)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2}$$\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both must equal a constant, which we denote as $-\\lambda^2$. This choice ensures a decaying solution in time and an oscillatory solution in space, as required by the physical situation.\n\nThe temporal part of the equation is:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\Theta(t)}\\frac{d\\Theta(t)}{dt} = -\\alpha \\lambda^2 \\implies \\frac{d\\Theta(t)}{dt} = -\\alpha \\lambda^2 \\Theta(t)$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation with the solution:\n$$\\Theta(t) = C \\exp(-\\alpha \\lambda^2 t)$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant.

The time constants $\\tau_n$ are inversely proportional to $n^2$. The longest time constant therefore corresponds to the smallest value of $n$, which is $n=1$. This is the fundamental mode of heat dissipation.\n$$\\tau_{relax} = \\tau_1 = \\frac{\\rho c L^2}{k \\pi^2}$$\nAfter an initial deposition of heat, any temperature profile can be expressed as a sum of these sinusoidal modes. The higher-order modes (large $n$) have small time constants and decay very rapidly. The long-term temperature evolution is dominated by the fundamental mode ($n=1$), which is the slowest to decay. The time constant $\\tau_{relax}$ is the time it takes for the amplitude of this dominant mode to decay to $1/e$ (approximately $37\\%$) of its initial value.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value for $\\tau_{relax}$ using the provided data:\nThermal conductivity, $k = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\nMass density, $\\rho = 1060\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\nSpecific heat capacity, $c = 3600\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\nScleral thickness, $L = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.60 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\tau_{relax}$:\n$$\\tau_{relax} = \\frac{(1060\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) (3600\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) (0.60 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{(0.50\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\pi^2}$$\n$$\\tau_{relax} = \\frac{(1060)(3600)(0.36 \\times 10^{-6})}{0.50 \\pi^2} \\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$\\tau_{relax} = \\frac{1.37376}{0.50 \\pi^2} \\,\\mathrm{s} \\approx \\frac{1.37376}{4.9348022} \\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$\\tau_{relax} \\approx 0.278468\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the thermal relaxation time is $0.278\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nIn the context of pulsed laser cyclophotocoagulation, this result is critical for preventing cumulative thermal damage. The value $\\tau_{relax} \\approx 0.278\\,\\mathrm{s}$ represents the characteristic time needed for heat to diffuse out of the treated tissue volume. If the inter-pulse off-time is significantly shorter than this value, the heat from one pulse will not have dissipated before the next pulse is delivered. This leads to heat accumulation, causing the peak temperature to rise with each successive pulse. Uncontrolled temperature elevation can result in excessive coagulation and damage to the sclera and adjacent structures, including the nearby filtering bleb. To ensure that each laser pulse has an independent and predictable thermal effect, the time between pulses must be long enough for the tissue to cool back to its baseline temperature.
