This pressure gradient is the difference between the intraocular pressure $P$ and the episcleral venous pressure $P_{evp}$. The constant of proportionality is the conventional outflow facility, $C$.\nThus, the conventional outflow rate is given by $C(P - P_{evp})$.\n\nThe conservation equation is:\n$$F = \\text{Conventional Outflow Rate} + \\text{Uveoscleral Outflow Rate}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the terms yields:\n$$F = C(P - P_{evp}) + U$$\nTo derive an expression for $P$, we rearrange the equation algebraically:\n$$F - U = C(P - P_{evp})$$\n$$\\frac{F - U}{C} = P - P_{evp}$$\n$$P = \\frac{F - U}{C} + P_{evp}$$\nThis is the required expression for $P$, known as the Goldmann equation.\n\nThe second task is to compute the change in IOP, defined as $\\Delta P = P_{\\text{pre}} - P_{\\text{post}}$, where $P_{\\text{pre}}$ is the preoperative IOP and $P_{\\text{post}}$ is the postoperative IOP.

Solution**\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the volumetric flow rate $Q$ for a steady, incompressible, laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid through a cylindrical tube of radius $r$ and length $L$, driven by a pressure drop $\\Delta P$. This is a classic problem in fluid dynamics, leading to the Hagen-Poiseuille equation.\n\nWe begin with the Navier–Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates $(R, \\theta, z)$, where $z$ is the axial direction. For this problem, we make the following standard assumptions for fully developed pipe flow:\n$1$. The flow is steady, so all time derivatives are zero ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$).\n$2$. The flow is axisymmetric, so there is no dependence on the angle $\\theta$ ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$), and the tangential velocity component is zero ($v_\\theta = 0$).\n$3$. The flow is fully developed, meaning the velocity profile does not change along the axial direction $z$. This implies that the radial velocity is zero ($v_R = 0$) and the axial velocity $v_z$ is only a function of the radial position $R$, i.e., $v_z = v_z(R)$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the axial component of the Navier–Stokes equation simplifies significantly. The inertial terms on the left-hand side become zero, and the equation reduces to a balance between pressure and viscous forces:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{dP}{dz} + \\mu \\left[ \\frac{1}{R}\\frac{d}{dR}\\left(R \\frac{dv_z}{dR}\\right) \\right] $$\nwhere $\\frac{dP}{dz}$ is the pressure gradient along the axis of the tube. Rearranging the equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dR}\\left(R \\frac{dv_z}{dR}\\right) = \\frac{R}{\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} $$\nSince the flow is fully developed, the pressure gradient $\\frac{dP}{dz}$ must be constant. We can integrate the equation with respect to $R$:\n$$ R \\frac{dv_z}{dR} = \\frac{R^2}{2\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} + C_1 $$\nDividing by $R$ and integrating again gives the velocity profile $v_z(R)$:\n$$ \\frac{dv_z}{dR} = \\frac{R}{2\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} + \\frac{C_1}{R} $$\n$$ v_z(R) = \\frac{R^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} + C_1 \\ln(R) + C_2 $$\nWe apply two boundary conditions to determine the integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$1$. The velocity must be finite at the centerline of the tube ($R=0$). Since $\\ln(R) \\to -\\infty$ as $R \\to 0$, we must have $C_1=0$.\n$2$. The no-slip condition at the tube wall ($R=r$) requires the fluid velocity to be zero: $v_z(r) = 0$.\nApplying the second condition with $C_1=0$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{r^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} + C_2 \\implies C_2 = -\\frac{r^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} $$\nSubstituting the constants back into the velocity equation yields the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$ v_z(R) = \\frac{1}{4\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} (R^2 - r^2) $$\nThe constant pressure gradient $\\frac{dP}{dz}$ can be expressed in terms of the total pressure drop $\\Delta P = P_{\\text{inlet}} - P_{\\text{outlet}}$ over the length $L$ of the tube. Since pressure decreases in the direction of flow, $\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$. Substituting this gives:\n$$ v_z(R) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} (r^2 - R^2) $$\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is found by integrating this velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the tube. The differential area element is $dA = 2\\pi R dR$.\n$$ Q = \\int_{A} v_z(R) dA = \\int_0^r \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} (r^2 - R^2) (2\\pi R) dR $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{2\\pi \\Delta P}{4\\mu L} \\int_0^r (r^2 R - R^3) dR $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left[ \\frac{r^2 R^2}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right]_0^r $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{r^4}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right) $$\nThis yields the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for the volumetric flow rate:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8\\mu L} $$\nNext, we evaluate $Q$ for the given parameters. First, we must convert all values to base SI units (meters, pascals, etc.).\nGiven:\n$r = 60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 60 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$L = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\mu = 0.001\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$\n$\\Delta P = 8\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n\nWe convert the pressure drop from $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ to $\\mathrm{Pa}$:\n$\\Delta P = 8\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} \\times \\frac{133.322\\,\\mathrm{Pa}}{1\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}} = 1066.576\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n\nNow, we substitute these SI values into the derived equation:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi (60 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^4 (1066.576\\,\\mathrm{Pa})}{8 (1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}) (1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})} $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi (1.296 \\times 10^{-17}\\,\\mathrm{m}^4) (1066.576\\,\\mathrm{Pa})}{8 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s\\cdot m}} $$\n$$ Q \\approx 5.4279256 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^3/s} $$\nAs a self-consistency check, we can calculate the Reynolds number $Re = \\frac{\\rho v_{avg} D}{\\mu}$, where $D=2r$ and $v_{avg} = Q/(\\pi r^2)$.
