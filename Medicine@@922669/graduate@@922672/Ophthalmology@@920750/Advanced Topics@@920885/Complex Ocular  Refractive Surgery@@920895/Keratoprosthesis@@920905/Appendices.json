The corneal rim adjacent to a keratoprosthesis is modeled as a thin spherical membrane with radius of curvature $r$ and thickness $t$. This membrane is subjected to a pressure differential $\\Delta P$ corresponding to the intraocular pressure (IOP) above atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the first principles of static equilibrium. Consider a hemispherical section of the spherical membrane. Two principal forces act on this section along any diametral plane.\nFirst, there is a force $F_P$ due to the internal pressure $\\Delta P$ acting on the projected circular area of the hemisphere. The projected area is a circle of radius $r$. The force is given by:\n$$F_P = \\Delta P \\cdot A_{\\text{projected}} = \\Delta P \\cdot (\\pi r^2)$$\n\nSecond, there is a resisting tensile force $F_{\\sigma}$ within the material of the membrane, acting along the cut edge (the circumference of the circle). This force is the product of the hoop stress $\\sigma$ and the cross-sectional area of the material, which is a thin ring. The area of this ring is the circumference $2\\pi r$ multiplied by the thickness $t$.\n$$F_{\\sigma} = \\sigma \\cdot A_{\\text{material}} = \\sigma \\cdot (2\\pi r t)$$\n\nFor the hemisphere to be in static equilibrium, these two opposing forces must be equal in magnitude:\n$$F_P = F_{\\sigma}$$\n$$\\Delta P \\cdot \\pi r^2 = \\sigma \\cdot 2\\pi r t$$\n\nWe can now solve for the hoop stress $\\sigma$:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{\\Delta P \\cdot \\pi r^2}{2\\pi r t}$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling common terms ($\\pi$ and one factor of $r$) yields the expression for the membrane stress:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{\\Delta P \\cdot r}{2t}$$\nThis is the well-known Young-Laplace equation for a thin-walled spherical pressure vessel. For a sphere, the stress is isotropic in the plane of the membrane, meaning the hoop stress and the meridional stress are equal.\n\nThe pressure differential $\\Delta P$ is the fundamental driver of this stress. In the absence of a pressure difference between the inside and outside of the cornea ($\\Delta P=0$), the tissue would be in a relaxed, unstressed state. The positive intraocular pressure (IOP) relative to the atmosphere creates an outward-directed force on every element of the cornea's inner surface. To maintain its shape and structural integrity, the corneal tissue must develop internal tensile stresses to counteract this outward pressure load. The equation $\\sigma = \\frac{\\Delta P \\cdot r}{2t}$ shows a direct linear proportionality between the stress $\\sigma$ and the pressure differential $\\Delta P$. At the junction with a rigid keratoprosthesis, the corneal rim bears this entire load, making the interface stress a critical parameter for the mechanical stability and long-term success of the implant.\n\nNext, we evaluate the stress $\\sigma$ using the given numerical values:\nRadius of curvature, $r = 7.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nThickness, $t = 7.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nPressure differential, $\\Delta P = 18\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\nTo maintain consistency in SI units, the pressure differential must be converted from millimeters of mercury ($\\mathrm{mmHg}$) to Pascals ($\\mathrm{Pa}$), where $1\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 1\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}$.

The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe problem asks for two things: an explanation for the irrelevance of preoperative corneal data and the calculation of the correct IOL power.\n\n**Part 1: Irrelevance of Preoperative Keratometry and Asphericity**\n\nThe KPro implantation involves a surgical procedure where the central part of the opaque native cornea is removed and replaced by the PMMA optic. This artificial optic, with a diameter of $3.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, becomes the new anterior refracting surface of the eye for light traveling along the visual axis. The preoperative keratometry ($K = 39.0\\ \\mathrm{D}$) and asphericity ($Q = -0.26$) are measurements of the patient's original corneal curvature and shape. Since this tissue is physically replaced, its optical properties are no longer part of the eye's imaging system. Any light forming an image on the macula must pass through the KPro. The residual native cornea, which lies outside the $3.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ KPro aperture, is optically irrelevant for on-axis vision as it is blocked by the iris. Therefore, the eye's new anterior power is determined solely by the manufactured KPro optic, given as $P_{\\mathrm{KPro}} = +43.0\\ \\mathrm{D}$, and not by the patient's preoperative corneal measurements.\n\n**Part 2: IOL Power Calculation for Emmetropia**\n\nWe model the eye as a system of two thin lenses separated in a medium of refractive index $n = 1.336$.\n*   Lens 1 (KPro): Power $P_1 = P_{\\mathrm{KPro}} = +43.0\\ \\mathrm{D}$, located at position $z=0$.\n*   Lens 2 (IOL): Power $P_2 = P_{\\mathrm{IOL}}$ (to be determined), located at position $z = d = 3.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n*   Retina: Located at position $z = L_{total} = 24.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nEmmetropia requires that parallel light from an object at infinity is focused onto the retina. We use the method of vergence transfer. Vergence is defined as $V = n/f$, where $f$ is the focal distance in a medium of index $n$.\n\n1.  **Light Incident on KPro**: For an object at infinity, the wavefronts are planar, and the incident vergence is $V_{in,1} = 0\\ \\mathrm{D}$.\n\n2.  **Light Exiting KPro**: The vergence immediately after the KPro is given by the lens-maker's formula for vergence:\n    $$V_{out,1} = V_{in,1} + P_1 = 0 + 43.0\\ \\mathrm{D} = +43.0\\ \\mathrm{D}$$\n\n3.  **Vergence Transfer to IOL**: The light propagates a distance $d = 3.5\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 0.0035\\ \\mathrm{m}$ through the aqueous humor ($n = 1.336$) to the IOL. The vergence changes during propagation. The vergence incident on the IOL, $V_{in,2}$, is:\n    $$V_{in,2} = \\frac{V_{out,1}}{1 - V_{out,1} \\frac{d}{n}}$$\n    Substituting the values:\n    $$V_{in,2} = \\frac{43.0}{1 - (43.0) \\frac{0.0035}{1.336}} = \\frac{43.0}{1 - 0.1126497} = \\frac{43.0}{0.8873503} \\approx +48.458\\ \\mathrm{D}$$\n\n4.  **Light Exiting IOL**: The vergence immediately after the IOL, $V_{out,2}$, is:\n    $$V_{out,2} = V_{in,2} + P_{\\mathrm{IOL}} = 48.458\\ \\mathrm{D} + P_{\\mathrm{IOL}}$$\n\n5.  **Focusing on the Retina**: For the light to focus on the retina, the final vergence $V_{out,2}$ must correspond to a focal point at the retinal plane. The distance from the IOL to the retina is $L' = L_{total} - d = 24.0\\ \\mathrm{mm} - 3.5\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 20.5\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 0.0205\\ \\mathrm{m}$. The required vergence is:\n    $$V_{out,2} = \\frac{n}{L'} = \\frac{1.336}{0.0205\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\approx +65.171\\ \\mathrm{D}$$\n\n6.  **Solving for IOL Power**: We equate the expressions for $V_{out,2}$ to find $P_{\\mathrm{IOL}}$:\n    $$48.458\\ \\mathrm{D} + P_{\\mathrm{IOL}} = 65.171\\ \\mathrm{D}$$\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{IOL}} = 65.171\\ \\mathrm{D} - 48.458\\ \\mathrm{D} = +16.713\\ \\mathrm{D}$$\nThe required IOL power is approximately $+16.7\\ \\mathrm{D}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Use preoperative keratometry $K$ and corneal asphericity $Q$... target IOL power approximately $+20\\ \\mathrm{D}$.**\nThis option's reasoning is fundamentally flawed. It incorrectly claims the \"KPro optic passively transmits the existing corneal shape.\" As established, the KPro *replaces* the central cornea, making preoperative measurements ($K$, $Q$) irrelevant. Standard IOL formulas rely on keratometry, so their use here is inappropriate. The resulting power is also incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Treat the KPro central optic as the eye’s fixed anterior thin lens... compute the IOL power by sequential vergence transfer... require post-IOL vergence to equal $n/L$ at the retina, where $L = 24.0\\ \\mathrm{mm} - 3.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. This gives an IOL power target of approximately $+16.7\\ \\mathrmD$.**\nThis option provides a physically correct justification: the KPro is a fixed anterior lens, and the original corneal tissue is no longer part of the optical path. The prescribed method, \"sequential vergence transfer through two separated thin lenses,\" is the correct first-principles approach. The final focusing condition is correctly stated as requiring vergence to be $n/L'$ (where the option uses $L$ to denote the IOL-retina distance $L' = 24.0\\ \\mathrm{mm} - 3.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$). The resulting calculated power of approximately $+16.7\\ \\mathrm{D}$ matches our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Since keratometry is unreliable after KPro, assume the anterior optical element contributes zero power... yielding an IOL power of approximately $+55.2\\ \\mathrm{D}$.**\nThis option correctly recognizes that keratometry is unreliable but draws an incorrect conclusion. Assuming the KPro contributes zero power ($P_{\\mathrm{KPro}} = 0$) is a major physical error, as it is explicitly given to have a power of $+43.0\\ \\mathrm{D}$. The subsequent calculation, $P_{\\mathrm{IOL}} = n/L = 1.336/0.024 \\approx +55.7\\ \\mathrm{D}$, models a single-lens aphakic eye, which is not the system described.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Use corneal asphericity $Q$ to estimate spherical aberration... because the KPro optic maintains the native corneal peripheral influence... target IOL power approximately $+18.0\\ \\mathrm{D}$.**\nThis option's reasoning is incorrect. The KPro does not maintain the \"native corneal peripheral influence\" on the central, focused image. Preoperative asphericity $Q$ is therefore irrelevant. Relying on an empirical offset is not a first-principles derivation. While the power of $+18.0\\ \\mathrm{D}$ is numerically closer to the correct answer than options A and C, it is based on fallacious reasoning.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4687374"}, {"introduction": "Long-term management of keratoprosthesis patients is dominated by the need for robust infection prophylaxis.

The relationship between mass and concentration is $C(t) = M(t) / V_t$.\n\nThe core principle for a system in periodic steady state is that over one complete dosing interval, $\\tau$, the total mass of the substance that enters the system must equal the total mass of the substance that is eliminated from the system.\n\nFirst, let us determine the mass of vancomycin added to the tear film with each dose.\nThe concentration of the vancomycin eyedrop is $C_{drop} = 14 \\ \\mathrm{mg/mL}$.\nThe volume of each drop is $V_{drop} = 30 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu L}$.\nA fraction $\\alpha = 0.70$ of the drop is lost, so the fraction that is retained and mixes with the tear film is $r = 1 - \\alpha = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30$.\nThe volume of the drop retained is $V_{retained} = r \\cdot V_{drop} = (1 - \\alpha) V_{drop}$.\nThe mass of vancomycin that enters the tear film with each dose, $M_{dose}$, is therefore:\n$$M_{dose} = C_{drop} \\cdot V_{retained} = C_{drop} (1 - \\alpha) V_{drop}$$\nSince one dose is administered every interval $\\tau$, the average rate of mass addition to the system, $\\text{Rate}_{in}$, is:\n$$\\text{Rate}_{in} = \\frac{M_{dose}}{\\tau} = \\frac{C_{drop} (1 - \\alpha) V_{drop}}{\\tau}$$\n\nNext, we determine the mass of vancomycin eliminated from the tear film. The problem states that the only elimination process is uniform tear outflow at a constant volumetric rate $F_t = 1.0 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu L/min}$.
