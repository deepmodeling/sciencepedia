The problem defines $ \\eta $ as the dimensionless ratio of output displacement to input displacement under the same driving command. In the context of a symmetric horizontal saccade task designed to elicit conjugate gaze, the neural command from the brainstem gaze centers is sent to the extraocular muscles of both eyes to produce symmetric movements. The movement of the healthy, contralateral natural eye serves as the reference or target motion, which we can define as the input displacement, $d_{\\text{input}}$. The resulting motion of the ocular prosthesis is the system's actual response, which we define as the output displacement, $d_{\\text{output}}$.\n\nBased on this systems definition, the expression for the motility transfer efficiency $ \\eta $ is:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{d_{\\text{output}}}{d_{\\text{input}}}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $ \\eta $ using the data provided.

Thus, the computed value for the motility transfer efficiency is $0.6429$.\n\nFinally, we must interpret the clinical significance of this result. An efficiency of $ \\eta = 0.6429 $ falls into a category that is generally considered clinically good to fair for an integrated ocular prosthesis. An ideal, though physically unachievable, outcome would be $ \\eta = 1 $, where the prosthesis perfectly mimics the movement of the natural eye. The observed deficit in motion, where the output is roughly two-thirds of the input, is a direct consequence of the biomechanical coupling between the orbital implant and the prosthesis.\n\nThe extraocular muscles, which are surgically attached to or have integrated with the porous orbital implant, generate the rotational force. This force rotates the implant within the orbit. The prosthesis, a separate component, rests in the socket anterior to the implant and is moved primarily through friction and conformity with the posterior surface of the implant and the surrounding conjunctival tissues. The transfer of motion is imperfect due to several factors:\n$1$. Mechanical compliance and energy dissipation within the soft tissues of the anophthalmic socket.\n$2$. Potential for microscopic slippage at the interface between the implant and the back surface of the prosthesis.\n$3$. The non-rigid nature of the entire dynamic system, where soft tissue deformation absorbs a fraction of the motive energy.\n\nIn terms of adequacy for daily fixation and cosmesis, an efficiency of this magnitude typically translates to a satisfactory cosmetic and functional result in the central field of gaze. During social interactions, which primarily involve small, subtle eye movements (microsaccades and small gaze shifts), the motion of the prosthesis will appear largely symmetric with the fellow eye, and any lag will be minimally perceptible to a casual observer. However, for larger saccades, such as the one measured in the test ($14\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ represents a significant gaze shift), the motility deficit will be more noticeable. The patient will likely develop adaptive strategies, such as using small head turns to accompany large gaze shifts, to maintain fixation and minimize the visible lag. In summary, while not perfect, a motility transfer efficiency of $0.6429$ represents a successful outcome for an integrated prosthesis, providing good cosmesis for most daily activities but with an expected and observable limitation in the extremes of gaze.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6429}\n$$", "id": "4700867"}]}
