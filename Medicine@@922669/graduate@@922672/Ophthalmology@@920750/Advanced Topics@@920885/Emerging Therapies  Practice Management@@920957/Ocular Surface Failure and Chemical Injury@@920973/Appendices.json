This is a classic single-compartment washout kinetics problem, which can be modeled using a mass balance equation.\n\nLet $N(t)$ be the amount of alkali (in $\\mathrm{mmol}$) in the ocular compartment at time $t$. The volume of the compartment is constant and is denoted by $V$. The concentration of alkali at time $t$ is $C(t) = \\frac{N(t)}{V}$. The irrigation fluid (Normal Saline, NS) flows into the compartment at a volumetric rate $Q$ and flows out at the same rate, maintaining the constant volume $V$.\n\nThe mass balance for the alkali in the compartment is described by the following differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of alkali mass in}) - (\\text{Rate of alkali mass out})\n$$\n\nThe inflow is alkali-free, so the concentration of alkali in the inflow, $C_{in}$, is $0$. Therefore, the rate of alkali mass in is $Q \\cdot C_{in} = 0$.\nThe compartment is assumed to be perfectly mixed, which means the concentration of alkali in the outflow, $C_{out}$, is equal to the uniform concentration within the compartment, $C(t)$.
