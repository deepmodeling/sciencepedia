Therefore, the flux is driven by the concentration gradient of the unionized species, $B$, within the epithelium.\n\nFirst, we determine the fraction of the drug that exists in the unionized form in the tear film. The drug is a weak base, and the relevant equilibrium is the dissociation of its conjugate acid, $BH^+$.\n$$\nBH^+ \\rightleftharpoons B + H^+\n$$\nThe Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for this equilibrium is:\n$$\npH = pK_a + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B]}{[BH^+]}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $[B]$ is the concentration of the unionized base and $[BH^+]$ is the concentration of the ionized conjugate acid.
