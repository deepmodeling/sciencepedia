## Introduction
The traditional application of eye drops is often inefficient, with the majority of the drug rapidly cleared from the ocular surface before it can reach its target. For diseases affecting the back of the eye, such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, anatomical barriers like the cornea and the blood-retinal barrier render topical treatments almost completely ineffective. Addressing these profound challenges requires moving beyond conventional dosing to more sophisticated approaches. Sustained-release and [targeted drug delivery](@entry_id:183919) represents a paradigm shift in ophthalmology, offering the potential to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations directly at the site of disease for extended periods, improving efficacy while reducing side effects and patient burden.

This article provides a comprehensive exploration of the science and engineering behind these advanced delivery systems. In the "Principles and Mechanisms" chapter, we will dissect the fundamental laws of [drug transport](@entry_id:170867) through ocular tissues, explore the kinetics of release from various platforms, and examine the critical issue of biocompatibility. Building on this foundation, the "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" chapter will illustrate how these principles are applied to solve real-world clinical problems, from selecting the right delivery strategy to designing "smart" [biomaterials](@entry_id:161584) and bridging into fields like gene therapy and health economics. Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" section will allow you to apply these concepts through practical, quantitative exercises that reinforce the core lessons in [drug delivery](@entry_id:268899) design.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The successful design of sustained-release and targeted ocular [drug delivery systems](@entry_id:161380) hinges on a deep understanding of the principles governing [molecular transport](@entry_id:195239) through complex biological tissues and the mechanisms by which delivery systems control drug release and interact with the host environment. This chapter elucidates these core principles, moving from fundamental transport laws to the design of advanced delivery platforms and their biological consequences.

### Fundamental Principles of Ocular Drug Transport

The eye is a compartmentalized organ protected by a series of formidable barriers that maintain its physiological integrity but also pose significant challenges to [drug delivery](@entry_id:268899). These barriers are both static, defined by anatomical structures, and dynamic, involving physiological clearance mechanisms. Understanding how to navigate these barriers is the first step in [rational drug design](@entry_id:163795).

#### Mass Transport Across Ocular Tissues

At its core, the passive movement of a drug molecule through a biological tissue is governed by **diffusion**, the net movement of a species from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. This process is quantitatively described by **Fick's first law of diffusion**. In one dimension, the flux $J$ (the [amount of substance](@entry_id:145418) passing through a unit area per unit time) is proportional to the concentration gradient $\frac{dC}{dx}$:

$J = -D \frac{dC}{dx}$

Here, $D$ is the **diffusion coefficient**, a measure of how quickly a molecule can move through a specific medium. For [steady-state diffusion](@entry_id:154663) across a simple planar tissue of thickness $L$ with a constant concentration difference $\Delta C$ maintained across it, the flux simplifies to:

$J = \frac{D}{L} \Delta C$

However, [biological transport](@entry_id:150000) is more complex. A drug molecule must first leave the aqueous vehicle and enter the tissue, a process governed by its affinity for the tissue relative to water. This is described by the **[partition coefficient](@entry_id:177413)**, $K$. The combination of these factors defines the **permeability**, $P$, of the barrier:

$P = \frac{D K}{L}$

The flux can then be expressed more generally as $J = P \Delta C$. This relationship highlights that a drug's ability to cross a barrier depends not only on its mobility within the tissue ($D$) but also on its ability to partition into it ($K$).

Consider a practical comparison between two key outer tissues of the eye: the corneal epithelium and the sclera. Hypothetical but physiologically plausible parameters for a small hydrophilic drug illustrate a crucial point [@problem_id:4728718]. The sclera, with a thickness of approximately $L_{\text{scl}} = 600 \ \mu\text{m}$, is over ten times thicker than the corneal epithelium ($L_{\text{epi}} \approx 50 \ \mu\text{m}$). Yet, its diffusion coefficient for a small hydrophilic molecule can be nearly two orders of magnitude greater ($D_{\text{scl}} \approx 2.0 \times 10^{-6}\ \text{cm}^{2}\ \text{s}^{-1}$) than that of the tight-junctioned epithelium ($D_{\text{epi}} \approx 3.0 \times 10^{-8}\ \text{cm}^{2}\ \text{s}^{-1}$). The ratio of their permeabilities (assuming $K \approx 1$ for a hydrophilic drug in these hydrated tissues) is $\frac{P_{\text{scl}}}{P_{\text{epi}}} = \frac{D_{\text{scl}}/L_{\text{scl}}}{D_{\text{epi}}/L_{\text{epi}}}$. Using these values, the sclera is found to be over five times more permeable than the epithelium, demonstrating that the diffusion coefficient is often a more dominant factor than thickness in determining overall permeability.

The diffusion coefficient itself is highly sensitive to the microstructure of the tissue. Tissues like the corneal stroma or the sclera are essentially [porous media](@entry_id:154591), composed of collagen fibrils and other [macromolecules](@entry_id:150543) forming a matrix filled with water. For a hydrophilic solute, diffusion occurs primarily through the aqueous pathways. An increase in the tissue's **hydration fraction** (porosity) directly increases the cross-sectional area available for diffusion and decreases the tortuosity of the diffusion path, both of which lead to a significant increase in the effective diffusion coefficient $D$ [@problem_id:4728718].

#### Navigating Ocular Barriers: A Tale of Two Molecules

The diverse physicochemical properties of ocular barriers mean that the optimal route of entry into the eye is highly dependent on the drug's own properties, particularly its size and lipophilicity. This can be effectively illustrated by considering two distinct drug candidates [@problem_id:4728716].

First, consider a small, moderately lipophilic molecule (e.g., molecular weight $\approx 350\ \text{Da}$, $\log P \approx 2.5$). For topical delivery, the primary path to the anterior chamber is **transcorneal**. The cornea is a stratified barrier: a lipophilic outer epithelium, a hydrophilic central stroma, and a thin, relatively leaky inner endothelium. A molecule with "biphasic" solubility—sufficiently lipophilic to partition into and cross the epithelium, yet sufficiently hydrophilic to dissolve in and diffuse through the stroma—will cross the cornea most efficiently. For such a molecule, the transcorneal route is dominant for accessing the aqueous humor, iris, and ciliary body.

Second, consider a large macromolecule, such as a [monoclonal antibody](@entry_id:192080) (e.g., molecular weight $\approx 150\ \text{kDa}$, hydrophilic, charged). Such a molecule is completely incapable of crossing the lipophilic corneal epithelium via topical administration. For posterior segment delivery, one might consider periocular (e.g., subconjunctival) or systemic administration. The **periocular route** aims for trans-scleral diffusion. The sclera, being a hydrated and porous tissue, is permeable to hydrophilic molecules. However, for a large macromolecule, the diffusion coefficient $D$ is extremely small (as per the Stokes-Einstein relation, $D \propto 1/r$, where $r$ is the [hydrodynamic radius](@entry_id:273011)). Thus, trans-scleral transport is very slow. Furthermore, the drug encounters the highly vascular choroid, leading to significant clearance before it can reach the retina.

The final hurdle is the **blood-retinal barrier (BRB)**, which isolates the retina from the systemic circulation. It consists of the inner BRB ([tight junctions](@entry_id:143539) between retinal capillary endothelial cells) and the outer BRB ([tight junctions](@entry_id:143539) between retinal pigment epithelium, or RPE, cells). For our large macromolecule, the BRB is virtually impermeable, making **systemic administration** ineffective for retinal targeting. Even for the small lipophilic molecule, while it has the potential to diffuse across cell membranes, it is often a substrate for active **efflux transporters** (like P-glycoprotein) embedded in the BRB, which pump the drug back into the bloodstream, severely limiting its retinal accumulation [@problem_id:4728716].

#### Cellular-Level Transport: Paracellular vs. Transcellular Pathways

The formidable nature of barriers like the corneal epithelium and the BRB lies in the **[tight junctions](@entry_id:143539)** that seal the space between adjacent cells. These junctions severely restrict the **paracellular pathway** (transport between cells). The effective pore radii of these junctions are on the sub-nanometer scale ($r_p \approx 0.5 - 1.0\ \text{nm}$), and the fractional area they occupy is minuscule (e.g., $\varepsilon \approx 10^{-4}$ for the BRB). Consequently, this route is only available to very small, hydrophilic ions and molecules, and it becomes rapidly occluded by [steric hindrance](@entry_id:156748) as the molecule's radius approaches the pore radius [@problem_id:4728712].

Given the limitations of the paracellular route, the **transcellular pathway** (transport through cells) becomes the primary focus for most drugs. For passive transcellular diffusion, a drug must cross at least two lipid cell membranes (apical and basolateral). This process is governed by the **pH-partition hypothesis**, which posits that only the neutral, unionized form of a drug is sufficiently lipid-soluble to partition into and diffuse across the cell membrane. The flux is therefore dependent on both the drug's intrinsic lipophilicity (measured by its partition coefficient, $\log P$) and the fraction of the molecule that is in the neutral state at physiological pH. The neutral fraction is determined by the drug's $pK_a$. A basic drug with a high $pK_a$ (e.g., $9.0$) will be almost fully protonated and charged at pH $7.4$, rendering its passive transcellular transport highly inefficient [@problem_id:4728712].

To overcome these challenges, advanced strategies are employed. One approach is the use of **prodrugs**, where the active molecule is temporarily modified (e.g., by adding a lipophilic ester group) to enhance its lipophilicity and optimize its ionization state for [membrane transport](@entry_id:156121). Once inside the target tissue, endogenous enzymes cleave the modification, releasing the active drug.

For macromolecules or for highly specific targeting across the BRB, one can hijack the cell's own transport machinery via **[receptor-mediated transcytosis](@entry_id:183878) (RMT)**. By decorating a drug or its nanocarrier with a ligand (e.g., an antibody against the transferrin receptor), the delivery system can bind to receptors on the endothelial cell surface, be internalized into a vesicle, transported across the cell, and released on the other side. This [active transport](@entry_id:145511) mechanism allows large molecules to bypass the tight junctions and the limitations of passive diffusion, representing a powerful strategy for targeted delivery to the retina [@problem_id:4728712].

### Mechanisms of Sustained Release

A primary goal of modern [drug delivery](@entry_id:268899) is to move beyond the fluctuating concentrations of conventional eye drops and injections. Sustained-release systems are designed to release a drug at a controlled rate over an extended period—days, months, or even years. This maintains the drug concentration within a desired therapeutic window, improving efficacy, reducing side effects associated with high peak concentrations, and increasing patient compliance by minimizing dosing frequency. The mechanism of release is determined by the physical and chemical properties of the delivery system.

#### Classifying Release Kinetics

The time course of drug release from a device can be described by several key mathematical models, each corresponding to a different underlying physical mechanism [@problem_id:4728757].

- **Zero-Order Release:** This is often the ideal profile, where the mass of drug released per unit time is constant ($dM/dt = k_0$). This results in stable, predictable drug levels. Zero-order kinetics are the hallmark of **reservoir systems**, where a drug core is enclosed by a non-degradable, rate-limiting membrane. As long as the drug concentration inside the reservoir is kept constant (e.g., by including excess solid drug) and the exterior is a "sink" (drug is rapidly cleared), the concentration gradient across the membrane remains constant, yielding a constant flux.

- **First-Order Release:** Here, the release rate is proportional to the mass of drug remaining in the device ($dM/dt = -k_1 M$). This leads to an exponential decay in the release rate over time. This profile is common in systems where the release is driven by a diminishing concentration gradient, such as the dissolution of drug from a population of microspheres into a [finite volume](@entry_id:749401) where the background drug concentration gradually increases.

- **Higuchi Model:** Many simple matrix systems, where the drug is uniformly dispersed within a non-swelling polymer, exhibit [release kinetics](@entry_id:188776) governed by diffusion. In the early stages of release, the cumulative amount of drug released ($M_t$) is proportional to the square root of time ($M_t \propto \sqrt{t}$). This is known as the Higuchi model. The release rate ($dM_t/dt \propto t^{-1/2}$) continuously decreases as the drug near the surface is depleted, forcing the remaining drug to diffuse through an ever-increasingly thick layer of depleted matrix.

- **Korsmeyer-Peppas Model:** Real-world polymeric systems often exhibit more complex behavior, especially when the polymer swells or erodes. The Korsmeyer-Peppas model is a semi-empirical power-law relationship, $\frac{M_t}{M_\infty} = k t^n$, that provides a more flexible description. The release exponent, $n$, gives insight into the mechanism. For a thin slab, $n \approx 0.5$ indicates Fickian diffusion (consistent with the Higuchi model), whereas $0.5 \lt n \lt 1.0$ suggests "anomalous" transport, where diffusion is coupled with [polymer swelling](@entry_id:190534) and relaxation.

#### Biodegradable Polymers: The Case of PLGA

Biodegradable implants, which gradually erode and are absorbed by the body after releasing their drug payload, represent a major class of sustained-release technologies, obviating the need for surgical removal. **Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)** is one of the most successful and widely used polymers for this purpose. The degradation of PLGA, and thus the drug release from it, is governed by the hydrolysis of its ester bonds. The rate of this process can be precisely tuned by manipulating the polymer's chemistry [@problem_id:4728744].

Several factors govern the hydrolysis rate:
1.  **Lactic:Glycolic Ratio:** Glycolic acid is less hydrophobic than lactic acid. Increasing the glycolic content (e.g., a $50:50$ ratio vs. an $85:15$ ratio) increases the polymer's hydrophilicity, allowing more water to penetrate the matrix and accelerate hydrolysis.
2.  **Molecular Weight:** Higher molecular weight polymers have a lower density of chain ends (which are more susceptible to hydrolysis) and form a more entangled, less permeable matrix, thus slowing down degradation.
3.  **End-Group Chemistry:** PLGA chains can be terminated with either a carboxylic acid or an ester "cap". Acid-terminated polymers are more hydrophilic and, critically, provide a source of acid catalyst for their own hydrolysis.

A crucial phenomenon in bulk-eroding polymers like PLGA is **[autocatalysis](@entry_id:148279)**. As hydrolysis proceeds, it generates acidic byproducts (lactic and glycolic acid). If these acids are generated faster than they can diffuse out of the polymer matrix, they accumulate, creating a highly acidic internal [microclimate](@entry_id:195467) (pH can drop to 2-3). This low pH then dramatically accelerates further hydrolysis.

This effect can be seen by comparing two PLGA formulations [@problem_id:4728744]. A PLGA with a $50:50$ ratio, lower molecular weight, and acid end-groups (Formulation X) will have a much faster intrinsic hydrolysis rate than a PLGA with an $85:15$ ratio, higher molecular weight, and an ester cap (Formulation Y). The faster acid generation in Formulation X leads to a significantly more acidic [microclimate](@entry_id:195467). For a drug whose release is controlled by polymer erosion, Formulation X will degrade rapidly, often leading to a faster, potentially burst-like release profile. In contrast, Formulation Y will erode more slowly and uniformly, providing a more prolonged, near-[zero-order release](@entry_id:159917). This tunability makes PLGA a versatile platform for ocular drug delivery.

### Ocular Drug Delivery Systems: Design and Application

Building on these fundamental principles, a wide array of delivery systems has been developed to meet specific clinical needs. These can be broadly categorized into nanometer-scale carriers and macroscopic devices.

#### Nanocarriers for Enhanced Delivery

Nanoparticles offer a versatile platform for improving [drug solubility](@entry_id:156547), protecting drugs from degradation, and facilitating transport across biological barriers. Three common types used in ophthalmology are [liposomes](@entry_id:170625), polymeric micelles, and solid [lipid nanoparticles](@entry_id:170308) (SLNs) [@problem_id:4728777].

- **Liposomes:** These are spherical vesicles composed of one or more [phospholipid](@entry_id:165385) bilayers surrounding an aqueous core. This structure allows them to encapsulate both hydrophilic drugs in the core and lipophilic drugs within the bilayer. For topical application, their primary advantage is overcoming the rapid **precorneal clearance** by tear turnover. By modifying their surface with mucoadhesive polymers, they can adhere to the ocular surface, extending their residence time and acting as a sustained-release reservoir. In the posterior segment, intravitreally injected [liposomes](@entry_id:170625) can act as a depot, slowly releasing their cargo to the retina and reducing injection frequency.

- **Polymeric Micelles:** Formed from the [self-assembly](@entry_id:143388) of amphiphilic [block copolymers](@entry_id:160725), these nanoparticles consist of a [hydrophobic core](@entry_id:193706) and a hydrophilic outer shell (corona). Their primary function is to solubilize poorly water-soluble (hydrophobic) drugs within their core. Their small size (typically $10-100\ \text{nm}$) and ability to be surface-functionalized make them particularly effective at enhancing **transcellular transport**. They can be taken up by corneal epithelial cells via [endocytosis](@entry_id:137762), thereby bypassing the tight junctions that block most other forms of transport.

- **Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLNs):** These are submicron particles with a solid lipid core stabilized by [surfactants](@entry_id:167769). They are ideal for loading lipophilic drugs. The solid nature of the core provides a significant barrier to drug diffusion, enabling a **diffusion-controlled sustained release**. When applied topically, this counters the rapid washout by tears. Their lipidic composition also promotes adhesion to the lipophilic corneal epithelium, potentially enhancing drug penetration.

#### Macroscopic Devices for Long-Term Therapy

For therapies requiring weeks to months of sustained delivery, larger devices that can be inserted or implanted are often preferred. These systems are engineered to achieve specific [release kinetics](@entry_id:188776) and can even modify the local pharmacokinetic environment [@problem_id:4728739].

- **Matrix Inserts:** These devices, such as a rod-shaped insert made of hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), consist of a drug dispersed within a polymer matrix. When placed in the conjunctival fornix, the hydrophilic polymer hydrates and swells, forming a gel. The drug is then released via diffusion through the gel and, in the case of erodible polymers like HPC, through the gradual dissolution of the matrix itself. The release rate is typically non-constant, decreasing over time. Such inserts may also be **mucoadhesive**, which helps retain the device and creates a localized drug reservoir in the mucus layer, further prolonging drug availability.

- **Reservoir Rings:** A drug-eluting ring, designed to sit in the conjunctival fornices, is often a reservoir system. It comprises a drug-loaded core encased in a rate-limiting polymeric membrane. As discussed previously, this design is capable of producing near **zero-order (constant-rate) release**, making it ideal for long-term, stable [drug delivery](@entry_id:268899) to the ocular surface.

- **Intracanalicular Plugs:** This innovative device offers a [dual function](@entry_id:169097). It is a small plug inserted into the punctum (the opening of the tear drainage duct) that contains a drug for sustained release. In addition to acting as a drug depot, it physically **occludes tear drainage**. The nasolacrimal drainage system accounts for the vast majority of tear clearance. By blocking this pathway, the plug dramatically increases the residence time of both the tears and the released drug on the ocular surface, significantly enhancing drug bioavailability from a given release rate.

#### Transport in the Posterior Segment: The Vitreous Challenge

Delivering drugs to the retina often involves placing a device or formulation directly into the vitreous humor. The vitreous is not a simple bag of water; it is a complex hydrogel primarily composed of water, collagen fibrils, and hyaluronic acid. Its physical state, and therefore its properties as a transport medium, changes significantly with age [@problem_id:4728721] [@problem_id:4728774].

The balance between [convective transport](@entry_id:149512) ([bulk flow](@entry_id:149773)) and [diffusive transport](@entry_id:150792) within the vitreous is quantified by the dimensionless **Péclet number**, $\mathrm{Pe} = \frac{uL}{D}$, where $u$ is the [fluid velocity](@entry_id:267320), $L$ is a characteristic distance, and $D$ is the drug's [effective diffusivity](@entry_id:183973).

In a **youthful, gel-like vitreous**, the viscosity is high, which dampens [fluid motion](@entry_id:182721) caused by eye movements (saccades), resulting in a very low bulk velocity ($u \approx 0$). The structured collagen-hyaluronan network also hinders diffusion, leading to a relatively low $D$. In this environment, $\mathrm{Pe} \ll 1$, and [drug transport](@entry_id:170867) is overwhelmingly dominated by slow **diffusion**.

With age, the vitreous undergoes **[liquefaction](@entry_id:184829)**, where the gel structure breaks down into liquid-filled lacunae. This process is often accompanied by **posterior vitreous detachment (PVD)**, where the vitreous body peels away from the retina. In this **aged, liquefied vitreous**, the viscosity is much lower (closer to that of water), and the hindrance to diffusion is reduced, leading to a higher $D$. Critically, saccadic eye movements can now induce significant convective flows, creating a non-negligible, anteriorly directed [bulk flow](@entry_id:149773) ($u > 0$). In this state, $\mathrm{Pe}$ can become much greater than 1, and **convection** becomes the dominant transport mechanism.

This age-related shift has profound implications for drug delivery. For an implant placed in the mid-vitreous to treat the macula (at the posterior pole), the onset of anteriorly directed convection is a major problem. The bulk flow acts to sweep the drug away from its target and towards the front of the eye. This compromises macular drug exposure and increases the risk of anterior segment side effects. The optimal strategy to counteract this is to place the implant as close to the target as possible, for instance, by using a dense, non-buoyant formulation that sediments and remains at the posterior pole. This minimizes the distance the drug must travel against the adverse convective current, ensuring robust delivery to the macula [@problem_id:4728774].

### Biocompatibility and the Foreign Body Response

No implanted device is truly inert. Upon insertion into tissue, its surface is immediately recognized by the host's immune system, initiating a cascade of events known as the **[foreign body response](@entry_id:204490) (FBR)**. The long-term success of any ocular implant depends on managing this response to avoid [chronic inflammation](@entry_id:152814) and [fibrotic encapsulation](@entry_id:184422) that can wall off the device and impede its function.

#### The Cascade of the Foreign Body Response

The FBR is a chronic, non-antigen-specific inflammatory reaction mediated by the [innate immune system](@entry_id:201771) [@problem_id:4728709]. The sequence begins within seconds of implantation:
1.  **Protein Adsorption:** Proteins from the surrounding biological fluid (e.g., vitreous humor) rapidly adsorb onto the material's surface. This process, known as **opsonization**, is driven by favorable thermodynamic changes ($\Delta G_{\text{ads}} \lt 0$). The composition and conformation of this adsorbed protein layer dictates the subsequent cellular response. Key opsonins include immunoglobulins and complement components like C3b.
2.  **Macrophage Recruitment and Activation:** Monocytes from the bloodstream are recruited to the site, where they differentiate into macrophages. These macrophages adhere to the adsorbed protein layer via integrin receptors.
3.  **Macrophage Fusion and Fibrosis:** Persistent inflammatory signals from the surface can cause macrophages to fuse into **foreign body giant cells (FBGCs)**. Activated macrophages and FBGCs release a cocktail of signaling molecules, including pro-inflammatory cytokines (like TNF-$\alpha$) and growth factors (like TGF-$\beta$). TGF-$\beta$ is a potent stimulator of fibroblasts, which are recruited to the site and begin depositing a dense collagen matrix.
4.  **Fibrotic Encapsulation:** Over time, this collagen deposition results in the formation of a thick, avascular fibrotic capsule around the implant, which can isolate it from the surrounding tissue, block drug release, and cause local tissue damage.

#### Engineering the Bio-interface

The key to controlling the FBR lies in controlling the initial [protein adsorption](@entry_id:202201) event. Surface chemistry is paramount. This can be illustrated by comparing a "stealth" surface with a pro-inflammatory one [@problem_id:4728709].

A **"stealth" surface** is designed to resist [protein adsorption](@entry_id:202201). A classic example is a surface grafted with a dense brush of **poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)**. PEG is a neutral, highly hydrophilic polymer that creates a sterically hindered and tightly bound water layer at the interface. This layer acts as a barrier that energetically repels proteins, minimizing opsonization and [complement activation](@entry_id:197846). With few inflammatory cues, macrophages that arrive at the surface are not strongly activated and tend to adopt a reparative, anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype. The result is minimal inflammation and a very thin or non-existent fibrotic capsule.

In contrast, a **hydrophobic and/or charged surface**, such as an amine-terminated cationic polymer, is highly "bioactive". Such surfaces avidly adsorb proteins from solution, often causing them to denature and expose cryptic sites that are potent triggers for [complement activation](@entry_id:197846) and macrophage recognition. The strong and persistent signaling from this surface drives a pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophage response, leading to [chronic inflammation](@entry_id:152814) and the formation of a thick fibrotic capsule.

Therefore, by rationally designing the surface chemistry of an implant, it is possible to modulate the body's reaction, ensuring the device remains functional and well-tolerated for its intended therapeutic lifetime. This bio-interfacial engineering is a critical component of modern ocular [drug delivery](@entry_id:268899) design.
