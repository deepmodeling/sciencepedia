To quantify eyelid laxity, the eyelid snap-back test is performed: the eyelid margin is displaced by a small distance and then released at time $t=0$, and the time to return sufficiently close to baseline is recorded. Assume the passive mechanical behavior of the eyelid–canthal tendon–tarsal plate composite can be modeled as a one-dimensional Kelvin–Voigt element, whose constitutive law for normal stress is $\\sigma(t) = E\\,\\varepsilon(t) + \\eta\\,\\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt}(t)$, where $E$ is the effective elastic modulus and $\\eta$ is the effective viscosity of the composite tissue.

The solution can proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Snap-Back Time $T$\nThe governing physics is described by the Kelvin–Voigt constitutive law:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = E\\,\\varepsilon(t) + \\eta\\,\\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt}(t)\n$$\nWe substitute the expressions for stress $\\sigma(t)$ and strain $\\varepsilon(t)$ in terms of force $F(t)$ and displacement $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\frac{F(t)}{A} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\varepsilon(t) = \\frac{x(t)}{L}\n$$\nThe derivative of strain is $\\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{x(t)}{L}\\right) = \\frac{1}{L}\\frac{dx}{dt}(t)$, since the length $L$ is constant. Substituting these into the constitutive equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{F(t)}{A} = E \\frac{x(t)}{L} + \\eta \\frac{1}{L}\\frac{dx}{dt}(t)\n$$\nThe problem states that for $t  0$, after the release of the eyelid, the system is stress-free, which implies the net external force is zero, $F(t) = 0$. The equation of motion for the relaxation process is therefore:\n$$\n0 = E \\frac{x(t)}{L} + \\frac{\\eta}{L}\\frac{dx}{dt}(t)\n$$\nMultiplying by $L$ simplifies this to:\n$$\n\\eta\\frac{dx}{dt}(t) + E\\,x(t) = 0\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{x} = -\\frac{E}{\\eta} dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial state $(x_0, 0)$ to a state $(x(t), t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{x_{0}}^{x(t)} \\frac{dx'}{x'} = -\\frac{E}{\\eta} \\int_{0}^{t} dt'\n$$\nThis gives:\n$$\n\\ln(x(t)) - \\ln(x_{0}) = -\\frac{E}{\\eta} t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{x(t)}{x_{0}}\\right) = -\\frac{E}{\\eta} t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the solution for the displacement as a function of time:\n$$\nx(t) = x_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta} t\\right)\n$$\nThis equation describes the exponential decay of the eyelid's displacement. The characteristic time constant of this decay is $\\tau = \\frac{\\eta}{E}$.\n\nThe snap-back time $T$ is defined as the time when the displacement reaches a fraction $\\alpha$ of its initial value, i.e., $x(T) = \\alpha\\,x_{0}$. Substituting this condition into the solution:\n$$\n\\alpha\\,x_{0} = x_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta} T\\right)\n$$\nThe initial displacement $x_{0}$ cancels out (as $x_{0} \\neq 0$):\n$$\n\\alpha = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta} T\\right)\n$$\nTo solve for $T$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(\\alpha) = -\\frac{E}{\\eta} T\n$$\nFinally, we isolate $T$:\n$$\nT = -\\frac{\\eta}{E} \\ln(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\eta}{E} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the snap-back time.\n\n### Calculation of $T$\nWe are given the following numerical values:\n$E = 1.4 \\times 10^{3}$ Pa\n$\\eta = 2.24 \\times 10^{2}$ Pa$\\cdot$s\n$\\alpha = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the time constant $\\tau = \\frac{\\eta}{E}$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{2.24 \\times 10^{2} \\, \\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}}{1.4 \\times 10^{3} \\, \\text{Pa}} = \\frac{2.24}{14} \\, \\text{s} = 0.16 \\, \\text{s}\n$$\nNow, we use the expression for $T$:\n$$\nT = \\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right) = (0.16 \\, \\text{s}) \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3.0 \\times 10^{-2}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nT = (0.16 \\, \\text{s}) \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.03}\\right) = (0.16 \\, \\text{s}) \\times \\ln(33.333...)\n$$\n$$\nT \\approx (0.16 \\, \\text{s}) \\times 3.5065579\n$$\n$$\nT \\approx 0.56104926 \\, \\text{s}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the snap-back time is $T = 0.5610$ s. Note that the values for $L$, $A$, and $x_0$ were not needed for this calculation, as the relaxation time depends only on the intrinsic material properties and the threshold criterion.\n\n### Explanation of Clinical Significance\nThe derived expression for the snap-back time is $T = \\frac{\\eta}{E} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right)$. This shows that $T$ is directly proportional to the effective viscosity $\\eta$ and inversely proportional to the effective elastic modulus $E$. The ratio $\\frac{\\eta}{E}$ is the characteristic relaxation time constant of the tissue.\n\nInvolutional laxity (age-related loosening) of eyelid tissue is primarily characterized by a loss of elastic fibers, which corresponds to a decrease in the elastic modulus $E$. A lower value of $E$ makes the tissue less stiff and less able to \"spring back\" to its original shape. According to the formula, a decrease in $E$ leads to an increase in the ratio $\\frac{\\eta}{E}$ and therefore an increase in the snap-back time $T$.\n\nThus, a longer snap-back time is a direct quantitative indicator of reduced elastic recoil, which is the physical basis of clinical laxity. This laxity can prevent the eyelid from maintaining proper apposition to the eyeball, leading to incomplete closure (lagophthalmos) and subsequent exposure of the ocular surface, which can cause dryness, irritation, and corneal damage (exposure keratopathy).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5610}\n$$", "id": "4732065"}, {"introduction": "Trichiasis, or the misdirection of eyelashes toward the globe, can cause significant corneal microtrauma.
