Let $n_{T}$ and $n_{C}$ be the sample sizes for each arm. The problem specifies equal allocation, so $n_{T} = n_{C} = n$. The population means are $\\mu_{T}$ and $\\mu_{C}$, and the common population standard deviation is $\\sigma$.\n\nThe endpoint of interest is the difference in sample means, $\\bar{D} = \\bar{X}_{T} - \\bar{X}_{C}$. Under the assumption that the sampling distribution of arm means is normal, and given that the participants are independent, the distribution of $\\bar{D}$ is also normal.\nThe expected value of $\\bar{D}$ is $E[\\bar{D}] = E[\\bar{X}_{T}] - E[\\bar{X}_{C}] = \\mu_{T} - \\mu_{C}$.\nThe variance of $\\bar{D}$ is $\\text{Var}(\\bar{D}) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_{T}) + \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_{C}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_{T}} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_{C}} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}$.\nThus, the sampling distribution of the difference in means is:\n$$ \\bar{D} \\sim N\\left(\\mu_{T} - \\mu_{C}, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}\\right) $$\nThe primary analysis involves testing the null hypothesis $H_{0}: \\mu_{T} - \\mu_{C} = 0$. The test statistic is formulated by standardizing $\\bar{D}$ under $H_0$. Let $SE(\\bar{D}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}$ be the standard error of the difference. The test statistic $Z$ is:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\bar{D} - 0}{SE(\\bar{D})} = \\frac{\\bar{X}_{T} - \\bar{X}_{C}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}} $$\nUnder $H_{0}$, this statistic follows a standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$.\n\nFor a two-sided test at a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$, we reject $H_{0}$ if the observed value of $|Z|$ exceeds the critical value $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$. Here, $1 - \\alpha/2 = 1 - 0.05/2 = 0.975$. The critical value is $z_{0.975}$. The rejection region is $|Z| > z_{0.975}$.\n\nThe power of the test is the probability of rejecting $H_{0}$ when the alternative hypothesis, $H_{A}$, is true. The problem specifies a clinically meaningful difference $\\Delta = \\mu_{T} - \\mu_{C} = 5$. We calculate power under the specific alternative $H_A: \\mu_{T} - \\mu_{C} = \\Delta$.\n\nUnder $H_A$, the test statistic $Z$ is not standard normal. Its distribution is:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\bar{D}}{SE(\\bar{D})} \\sim N\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{SE(\\bar{D})}, 1\\right) = N\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}}, 1\\right) $$\nPower, $1-\\beta$, is the probability of $Z$ falling into the rejection region, given $H_A$ is true.\n$$ 1-\\beta = P(|Z| > z_{1-\\alpha/2} | H_A) $$\nFor a positive difference $\\Delta > 0$, the mean of $Z$ under $H_A$ is positive. Thus, the probability of rejecting in the lower tail ($Z  -z_{1-\\alpha/2}$) is negligible compared to the probability of rejecting in the upper tail ($Z > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$). The power is therefore dominated by the upper tail probability:\n$$ 1-\\beta \\approx P(Z > z_{1-\\alpha/2} | H_A) $$\nTo evaluate this probability, we can standardize the random variable $Z$ under $H_A$. Let $\\mu_Z = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}}$ be the mean of $Z$ under $H_A$. Then $Z - \\mu_Z \\sim N(0, 1)$.\nThe power requirement can be written as:\n$$ P(Z - \\mu_Z > z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\mu_Z) = 1-\\beta $$\nSince $Z - \\mu_Z$ is a standard normal variable, the value $z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\mu_Z$ must correspond to the quantile $z_{\\beta}$ of the standard normal distribution, where $P(\\text{std. normal} > z_{\\beta}) = 1-\\beta$. Note that $z_{\\beta} = -z_{1-\\beta}$.\nSo, we have the equality:\n$$ z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\mu_Z = z_{\\beta} = -z_{1-\\beta} $$\nThis leads to the condition on the mean of the test statistic under the alternative:\n$$ \\mu_Z = z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mu_Z$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}} = z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta} $$\nTo achieve the desired power, the sample size $n$ must be large enough to satisfy this condition. Therefore, we establish the inequality:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}} \\ge z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta} $$\nWe now solve for the minimum per-arm sample size, $n$. Rearranging the inequality:\n$$ \\Delta \\ge (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta}) \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}} $$\nSquaring both sides:\n$$ \\Delta^2 \\ge (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2 \\left(\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}\\right) $$\nFinally, isolating $n$:\n$$ n \\ge \\frac{2\\sigma^2 (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{\\Delta^2} $$\nThe problem provides the following values: $\\sigma = 12$, $\\Delta = 5$, $\\alpha = 0.05$, and $1-\\beta = 0.9$. We find the corresponding quantiles of the standard normal distribution:\n$z_{1-\\alpha/2} = z_{1-0.025} = z_{0.975} \\approx 1.959964$.\n$z_{1-\\beta} = z_{1-0.1} = z_{0.9} \\approx 1.281552$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $n$:\n$$ n \\ge \\frac{2(12)^2 (1.959964 + 1.281552)^2}{5^2} $$\n$$ n \\ge \\frac{2(144) (3.241516)^2}{25} $$\n$$ n \\ge \\frac{288 (10.50741)}{25} $$\n$$ n \\ge \\frac{3026.134}{25} $$\n$$ n \\ge 121.04536 $$\nThe problem requires reporting the planned per-arm sample size as the smallest integer greater than or equal to this real-valued result.\n$$ n = \\lceil 121.04536 \\rceil = 122 $$\nTherefore, the minimum required sample size per arm is $122$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{122}\n$$", "id": "4703033"}, {"introduction": "Ophthalmic research frequently involves measurements from both eyes of the same individual, creating \"clustered\" data where observations are not fully independent.
