It is based on fundamental principles of electromagnetism and standard practice in biomedical engineering, specifically neural stimulation with microelectrodes. The provided data (electrode size, current amplitude, pulse duration, safety limit) are realistic for epiretinal prostheses. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary information provided for a unique solution. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the per-phase charge density on the surface of a microelectrode. This density, which we will denote as $\\sigma_Q$, is the total charge delivered during one phase of the stimulus pulse, $Q_{phase}$, divided by the geometric surface area of the electrode face, $A$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total charge, $Q_{phase}$, delivered during the cathodal phase. The problem states that electric current $I$ is the rate of charge flow, $I = dQ/dt$. For a rectangular current pulse, the amplitude $I$ is constant over the duration of the pulse, $\\Delta t$. Therefore, we can integrate this relationship to find the total charge:\n$$Q_{phase} = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} I \\, dt = I \\cdot \\Delta t$$\nThe given values are the current amplitude $I = 100~\\mu\\mathrm{A}$ and the phase duration $\\Delta t = 0.5~\\mathrm{ms}$. We convert these to base SI units (Amperes and seconds) for the calculation.\n$$I = 100~\\mu\\mathrm{A} = 100 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{A} = 1 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{A}$$\n$$\\Delta t = 0.5~\\mathrm{ms} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{s} = 5 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{s}$$\nNow, we can compute the charge:\n$$Q_{phase} = (1 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{A}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{s}) = 5 \\times 10^{-8}~\\mathrm{C}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the area of the electrode face, $A$. The electrode is a circular disk with a given radius of $r = 100~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The area of a disk is given by the formula $A = \\pi r^2$. First, we convert the radius to SI units (meters).\n$$r = 100~\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 100 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m} = 1 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe area is then:\n$$A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (1 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{m})^2 = \\pi \\times 10^{-8}~\\mathrm{m}^2$$\n\nThe problem requires the final charge density to be in units of millicoulombs per square centimeter ($\\mathrm{mC/cm}^2$). We must convert both our calculated charge and area to the appropriate units.\nConverting charge $Q_{phase}$ from Coulombs ($\\mathrm{C}$) to millicoulombs ($\\mathrm{mC}$):\n$$Q_{phase} = 5 \\times 10^{-8}~\\mathrm{C} \\times \\frac{10^3~\\mathrm{mC}}{1~\\mathrm{C}} = 5 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{mC}$$\nConverting area $A$ from square meters ($\\mathrm{m}^2$) to square centimeters ($\\mathrm{cm}^2$):\n$$A = \\pi \\times 10^{-8}~\\mathrm{m}^2 \\times \\frac{(100~\\mathrm{cm})^2}{(1~\\mathrm{m})^2} = \\pi \\times 10^{-8}~\\mathrm{m}^2 \\times \\frac{10^4~\\mathrm{cm}^2}{1~\\mathrm{m}^2} = \\pi \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm}^2$$\n\nNow we can compute the charge density $\\sigma_Q$:\n$$\\sigma_Q = \\frac{Q_{phase}}{A} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{mC}}{\\pi \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm}^2} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-1}}{\\pi}~\\mathrm{mC/cm}^2 = \\frac{0.5}{\\pi}~\\mathrm{mC/cm}^2$$\n\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we evaluate this expression:\n$$\\sigma_Q = \\frac{0.5}{\\pi} \\approx 0.159154943...~\\mathrm{mC/cm}^2$$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\n$$\\sigma_Q \\approx 0.1592~\\mathrm{mC/cm}^2$$\n\nFinally, we must assess whether this computed value is within the commonly cited safe per-phase charge-density limit for platinum, which is given as $0.35~\\mathrm{mC/cm}^2$.\nWe compare our calculated value to this limit:\n$$0.1592~\\mathrm{mC/cm}^2 < 0.35~\\mathrm{mC/cm}^2$$\nThe comparison shows that the calculated charge density is less than the specified safety limit.

Irradiance is defined as radiant power per unit area. The calculation proceeds in three main steps: determining the radiant power reaching the retina, determining the area of the illuminated spot on the retina, and then computing their ratio.\n\nFirst, we determine the radiant power incident on the retina, $P_{\\text{retina}}$.
