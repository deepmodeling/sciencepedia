By manipulating this model, you will gain insight into how to set strategic targets for surgical rates, moving from simply keeping up with new cases to actively eliminating the existing backlog of blindness.", "problem": "A national eye health program aims to plan Cataract Surgical Rate (CSR), defined as the number of cataract surgeries performed per million people per year. Let the stock of unmet need (the backlog of operable cataract cases) at the beginning of a year be denoted by $B$ (cases per million). Assume a stock-and-flow conservation model for the backlog where the annual change in backlog equals the incidence of new operable cataract cases minus the number of surgeries performed. Specifically, if $I$ is the incidence of operable cataract (cases per million per year) and $S$ is the CSR (surgeries per million per year), then the yearly stock update follows $B_{t+1} = B_{t} + I - S$.\n\nGiven an incidence $I = 3500$ and a current CSR $S = 3000$, both in cases per million per year, and ignoring any attrition of backlog other than surgical removal, determine the following:\n1.

Given value: $I = 3500$.\n-   $S$: Cataract Surgical Rate (CSR), surgeries per million per year. Given value: $S = 3000$.\n-   Question 1: Determine the annual change in backlog, $B_{t+1} - B_t$.\n-   Question 2: Determine the CSR required to achieve a $10\\%$ annual reduction in backlog, i.e., $B_{t+1} = 0.9 B_{t}$. This CSR should be expressed as a function of $B$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is analyzed for validity.\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem uses a standard stock-and-flow conservation model, which is a fundamental and widely-used tool in systems dynamics and epidemiology for modeling population-level health metrics. The equation $B_{t+1} = B_{t} + I - S$ represents a basic mass balance principle (change in stock = inflow - outflow). The concepts of incidence, backlog (prevalence), and intervention rate are standard in public health. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear mathematical model and sufficient data to answer both questions. Question 1 requires a direct calculation from the given constants. Question 2 requires algebraic manipulation to derive an expression for one variable in terms of another, based on a clearly defined target condition. Both questions lead to unique and meaningful solutions.\n-   **Objectivity**: The language is precise and quantitative. All terms are defined, and the model is stated explicitly. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n-   **Flaw Checklist**: The problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or ill-posed. The simplification of ignoring non-surgical attrition is explicitly stated, which is a common and acceptable practice in creating tractable models.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe analysis is based on the provided discrete-time stock-and-flow model for the backlog of operable cataract cases, $B$. The governing equation is given as:\n$$B_{t+1} = B_{t} + I - S$$\nwhere $B_{t}$ is the backlog at the beginning of year $t$, $I$ is the annual incidence of new cases, and $S$ is the number of surgeries performed during the year (the CSR). All quantities are measured in units of cases per million people.\n\n**Part 1: Annual change in backlog**\n\nThe annual change in backlog is the difference between the backlog at the end of a year ($t+1$) and the beginning of the year ($t$). This change, denoted as $\\Delta B$, is defined as:\n$$\\Delta B = B_{t+1} - B_{t}$$\nBy rearranging the governing equation, we can express $\\Delta B$ in terms of incidence $I$ and surgical rate $S$:\n$$B_{t+1} - B_{t} = I - S$$\n$$\\Delta B = I - S$$\nThe problem provides the values for the incidence and the current surgical rate:\n-   Incidence, $I = 3500$ cases per million per year.\n-   Current CSR, $S = 3000$ surgeries per million per year.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\Delta B$:\n$$\\Delta B = 3500 - 3000 = 500$$\nThe annual change in backlog is $500$ cases per million per year. A positive value indicates that the backlog is increasing.\n\n**Part 2: CSR required for a 10% reduction in backlog**\n\nThe objective is to determine the specific CSR, which we will denote as $S_{\\text{target}}$, that would result in a $10\\%$ annual reduction in the backlog. A $10\\%$ reduction means that the backlog at the end of the year, $B_{t+1}$, is $90\\%$ of the backlog at the beginning of the year, $B_{t}$. This target condition can be written as:\n$$B_{t+1} = (1 - 0.1) B_{t} = 0.9 B_{t}$$\nWe substitute this target condition into the left-hand side of the governing equation, replacing $S$ with $S_{\\text{target}}$:\n$$0.9 B_{t} = B_{t} + I - S_{\\text{target}}$$\nNow, we solve for $S_{\\text{target}}$ to find the required surgical rate as a function of the initial backlog $B_{t}$ and the incidence $I$:\n$$S_{\\text{target}} = B_{t} + I - 0.9 B_{t}$$\n$$S_{\\text{target}} = (1 - 0.9) B_{t} + I$$\n$$S_{\\text{target}} = 0.1 B_{t} + I$$\nThe problem asks for this as an analytic function of $B$. We can drop the time index $t$ for generality, representing the CSR needed for a given backlog level $B$. The incidence $I$ is given as $3500$:\n$$S_{\\text{target}} = 0.1 B + 3500$$\nThis expression gives the required Cataract Surgical Rate (in surgeries per million per year) to achieve a $10\\%$ reduction in a backlog of size $B$ (in cases per million).\n\nThe two results are the numerical value for the annual change in backlog under current conditions, and the analytical expression for the target CSR.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n500  0.1B + 3500\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4677310"}]}
