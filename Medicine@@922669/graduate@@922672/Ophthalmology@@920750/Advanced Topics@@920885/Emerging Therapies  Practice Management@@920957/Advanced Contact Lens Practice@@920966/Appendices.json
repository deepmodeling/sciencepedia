Oxygen transmissibility is defined by the ratio $Dk/t$ when $Dk$ and $t$ are expressed in compatible units. Consider a silicone hydrogel lens with $Dk = 100$ barrer and central thickness $t = 0.08$ mm. The foundational basis for oxygen transport is Fick’s first law of diffusion, which states that oxygen flux $J$ through a membrane is proportional to the gradient in oxygen partial pressure and inversely proportional to the total resistance to mass transfer. In this context, lens resistance is proportional to $t/Dk$, and the total resistance is the sum of the lens resistance and extra-lens resistances (such as tear film and boundary layers) under steady open-eye wear.\n\nAssume the following empirically validated relationships for silicone hydrogel lenses under open-eye conditions:\n1. The Equivalent Oxygen Percentage (EOP) fraction $f$ (dimensionless, between $0$ and $1$), defined as the fraction of the no-lens oxygen flux reaching the cornea, follows an empirical curve versus oxygen transmissibility:\n$$\nf(Dk/t) = \\frac{Dk/t}{Dk/t + K},\n$$\nwhere $K = 25$ is a positive constant expressed in the same transmissibility units as $Dk/t$ and represents the lumped extra-lens resistance in transmissibility coordinates.\n\n2.

The concepts of oxygen permeability ($Dk$), transmissibility ($Dk/t$), equivalent oxygen percentage (EOP), and resulting corneal swelling ($S$) are standard in the field of ophthalmology and vision science. The numerical values provided for $Dk$ ($100$ barrer) and $t$ ($0.08$ mm) are characteristic of modern silicone hydrogel contact lenses. The empirical models for $f$ and $S$ are well-established simplified representations used in the literature (related to the work of Hill, Brennan, and others). The constants $K=25$ and $\\alpha=0.12$ are plausible fitting parameters for such models.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary functions and constants to compute the required values. A potential ambiguity lies in the units of $K=25$. The problem states $K$ is \"expressed in the same transmissibility units as $Dk/t$\". The standard unit for transmissibility is often written as a multiple of $10^{-9} \\frac{(\\text{cm}^3 \\text{ O}_2) \\text{cm}^{-2}}{\\text{s} \\cdot \\text{mmHg}}$. The instruction to report $Dk/t$ relative to this $10^{-9}$ unit implies that the numerical value of $Dk/t$ to be used in the formula for $f$ should be this coefficient. For consistency, the value of $K=25$ must also be interpreted as the coefficient in these same units. This interpretation renders the problem fully specified and internally consistent, as the units in the fraction for $f$ will cancel, leaving a dimensionless result as required. The problem is objective and free of non-scientific claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to calculate the oxygen transmissibility ($Dk/t$) and the fractional corneal swelling ($S$) for the given silicone hydrogel contact lens.\n\nFirst, we calculate the oxygen transmissibility, $Dk/t$. The given oxygen permeability is $Dk = 100$ barrer. The standard definition of this unit in contact lens research is $1 \\text{ barrer} = 10^{-11} \\frac{(\\text{cm}^3 \\text{ O}_2) \\cdot \\text{cm}}{\\text{cm}^2 \\cdot \\text{s} \\cdot \\text{mmHg}}$. The central thickness is given as $t = 0.08$ mm. To ensure compatible units for the ratio $Dk/t$, the thickness must be converted to centimeters:\n$$t = 0.08 \\text{ mm} = 0.08 \\times 10^{-1} \\text{ cm} = 0.008 \\text{ cm}$$\nNow, the oxygen transmissibility can be computed:\n$$ \\frac{Dk}{t} = \\frac{100 \\text{ barrer}}{0.008 \\text{ cm}} = \\frac{100 \\times 10^{-11} \\frac{\\text{cm}^3 \\cdot \\text{cm}}{\\text{cm}^2 \\cdot \\text{s} \\cdot \\text{mmHg}}}{0.008 \\text{ cm}} = \\frac{100}{0.008} \\times 10^{-11} \\frac{\\text{cm}^3}{\\text{cm}^2 \\cdot \\text{s} \\cdot \\text{mmHg}} $$\nThe numerical coefficient is:\n$$ \\frac{100}{0.008} = \\frac{100}{8 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{10^2 \\times 10^3}{8} = \\frac{10^5}{8} = 12500 $$\nTherefore, the transmissibility is:\n$$ \\frac{Dk}{t} = 12500 \\times 10^{-11} \\frac{\\text{cm}^3}{\\text{cm}^2 \\cdot \\text{s} \\cdot \\text{mmHg}} $$\nThe problem requires this value to be expressed in standard $10^{-9}$ units. We perform a conversion of the scientific notation:\n$$ 12500 \\times 10^{-11} = 125 \\times 10^2 \\times 10^{-11} = 125 \\times 10^{-9} $$\nThe numerical value for $Dk/t$ to be reported is $125$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $125.0$.\n\nNext, we compute the EOP fraction, $f$, using the provided empirical formula. Let $X$ represent the numerical value of $Dk/t$ in the standard units, so $X = 125$. The constant $K$ is given as $25$ in the same units.\n$$ f = \\frac{X}{X + K} = \\frac{125}{125 + 25} = \\frac{125}{150} = \\frac{5 \\times 25}{6 \\times 25} = \\frac{5}{6} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the fractional corneal swelling, $S$, using its empirical relationship with $f$. The constant $\\alpha$ is given as $0.12$.\n$$ S = \\alpha (1 - f) = 0.12 \\left(1 - \\frac{5}{6}\\right) = 0.12 \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = \\frac{0.12}{6} = 0.02 $$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to four significant figures, which gives $0.02000$.\n\nThe predicted corneal swelling is $S = 0.02$. Comparing this to the threshold of $0.03$:\n$$ 0.02  0.03 $$\nThus, the predicted corneal swelling does not exceed $0.03$ (i.e., $3\\%$).\n\nThe final numerical results, rounded to four significant figures, are $125.0$ for the oxygen transmissibility coefficient and $0.02000$ for the fractional corneal swelling.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 125.0  0.02000 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4650135"}, {"introduction": "Correcting significant astigmatism with a Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP) lens requires a sophisticated understanding of optical principles beyond the lens itself.

A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe total astigmatism observed during an over-refraction is the linear superposition of all astigmatic components. Since all principal meridians are aligned, we can treat the cylinder powers as scalars. We adopt the standard minus cylinder notation.\n\n1.  **Define Known Cylinder Powers:**\n    - Corneal cylinder ($C_C$): The corneal toricity of $2.50$ D corresponds to a cylinder power of $C_C = -2.50$ D.\n    - Lens back surface cylinder ($C_{BSC}$): The trial lens's back surface toricity of $1.00$ D corresponds to a cylinder of $C_{BSC} = -1.00$ D.\n    - Measured residual astigmatism ($C_{Res}$): Given as $C_{Res} = -1.50$ D.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Tear Lens Cylinder ($C_{TL}$):**\n    The tear lens is the volume of tears between the RGP lens's back surface and the cornea's front surface. Its astigmatism is induced by the difference in toricity between these two surfaces. The standard formula is:\n    \n    $$C_{TL} = C_C - C_{BSC}$$\n    \n    Substituting the given values:\n    \n    $$C_{TL} = (-2.50 \\text{ D}) - (-1.00 \\text{ D}) = -1.50 \\text{ D}$$\n    \n    The tear lens contributes a cylinder of $-1.50$ D.\n\n3.  **Determine the Internal Astigmatism ($C_I$):**\n    The residual astigmatism measured during the over-refraction ($C_{Res}$) is the sum of the patient's internal (lenticular) astigmatism ($C_I$) and the astigmatism of the tear lens ($C_{TL}$). We assume the trial lens used for this measurement has a spherical front surface (no front surface cylinder).\n    \n    $$C_{Res} = C_I + C_{TL}$$\n    \n    We can solve for the internal astigmatism, $C_I$:\n    \n    $$C_I = C_{Res} - C_{TL}$$\n    \n    Substituting the known values:\n    \n    $$C_I = (-1.50 \\text{ D}) - (-1.50 \\text{ D}) = 0 \\text{ D}$$\n    \n    This indicates the patient has no clinically significant internal astigmatism.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Front Surface Cylinder ($C_{FSC}$):**\n    The final bitoric RGP lens must eliminate the residual astigmatism, so the final over-refraction must be zero. The final lens will have a front surface cylinder, $C_{FSC}$, which provides the necessary additional astigmatic correction. The total astigmatism of the final system must be zero.\n    \n    $$C_{Res, final} = C_I + C_{TL, final} + C_{FSC} = 0$$\n    \n    It is standard practice to maintain the back surface curvature that provided a good physical fit during the trial. Therefore, the final lens has the same back surface cylinder, and the tear lens cylinder remains unchanged: $C_{TL, final} = -1.50$ D. The internal astigmatism is also unchanged: $C_I = 0$ D.\n    \n    We set up the equation for the final lens:\n    \n    $$(0 \\text{ D}) + (-1.50 \\text{ D}) + C_{FSC} = 0$$\n    \n    Solving for $C_{FSC}$:\n    \n    $$C_{FSC} = 1.50 \\text{ D}$$\n    \n    This is the required cylinder power for the front surface of the final bitoric lens.
