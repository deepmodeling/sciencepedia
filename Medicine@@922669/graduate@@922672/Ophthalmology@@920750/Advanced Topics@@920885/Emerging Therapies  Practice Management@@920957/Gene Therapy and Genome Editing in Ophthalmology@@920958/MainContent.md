## Introduction
Gene therapy and [genome editing](@entry_id:153805) represent a paradigm shift in modern medicine, offering the potential to correct diseases at their most fundamental level. Within ophthalmology, these technologies have ushered in an era of unprecedented hope for patients with inherited retinal dystrophies, a diverse group of debilitating conditions that often lead to irreversible blindness and have historically lacked effective treatments. The challenge, however, lies in translating the powerful concepts of genetic correction into safe and efficacious therapies for the complex and immunologically unique environment of the [human eye](@entry_id:164523). This requires a deep, interdisciplinary understanding of molecular biology, ocular physiology, and clinical translation.

This article will guide you through this revolutionary field. The first chapter, **"Principles and Mechanisms,"** will lay the groundwork by dissecting the molecular tools of the trade, from the viral vectors used for delivery to the intricacies of CRISPR-based editors and the cell's own repair machinery. We will then transition from theory to practice in the **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections"** chapter, exploring how these tools are used to design treatments for specific diseases, navigate preclinical and clinical trials, and manage the host immune response. Finally, the **"Hands-On Practices"** section will provide you with the opportunity to apply these concepts to solve practical problems in vector design, delivery, and therapeutic prediction. This structured journey will equip you with a comprehensive understanding of the science, strategy, and application of genetic medicine in ophthalmology.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delineates the foundational principles and molecular mechanisms that underpin modern ocular gene and genome therapy. We will dissect the core components of this therapeutic paradigm, from the [viral vectors](@entry_id:265848) that serve as delivery vehicles to the diverse molecular payloads they carry. We will then explore the intricate interplay between these engineered tools and the unique biological landscape of the human retina, including its DNA repair machinery, anatomical barriers, and specialized immune environment.

### Viral Vectors for Retinal Gene Transfer

The success of any gene therapy is contingent upon the safe and efficient delivery of a genetic payload to the target cells. In ophthalmology, this is most commonly achieved using recombinant [viral vectors](@entry_id:265848), which have been engineered to be replication-incompetent while retaining their natural ability to transduce cells. The three most studied classes of vectors for retinal applications are Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV), Lentivirus (LV), and Adenovirus (Ad). Each possesses distinct biological properties that dictate its suitability for specific therapeutic goals [@problem_id:4676302].

**Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV)** is a small, non-pathogenic parvovirus that has become the leading platform for in vivo gene therapy, particularly in the retina. Its primary advantages are its excellent safety profile, low [immunogenicity](@entry_id:164807) compared to other vectors, and its ability to transduce a variety of retinal cell types, including post-mitotic photoreceptors and Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) cells. AAV [tropism](@entry_id:144651) is determined by its [capsid](@entry_id:146810) serotype; different serotypes bind to distinct [cell-surface receptors](@entry_id:154154), allowing for preferential targeting of certain cells. For instance, serotypes like AAV2, AAV5, and AAV8 are known to efficiently transduce [photoreceptors](@entry_id:151500) following subretinal delivery. The AAV genome, a single-stranded DNA molecule, is delivered to the nucleus where it is converted to double-stranded DNA and persists predominantly as a stable, non-integrating **episome**. In non-dividing cells like neurons, this episome is not diluted by cell division, providing a basis for durable, long-term transgene expression from a single administration [@problem_id:4676302].

**Lentiviral Vectors (LV)**, derived from [retroviruses](@entry_id:175375) such as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1), possess a key mechanistic difference from AAV. LVs are RNA viruses that, upon entering a cell, reverse-transcribe their genome into DNA. This DNA is then actively transported into the nucleus and **integrates** into the host cell's chromosomes, a process mediated by the viral [integrase](@entry_id:168515) enzyme. This integration offers the potential for truly permanent transgene expression that is passed on to all daughter cells, a useful feature for targeting dividing cell populations. Critically, LVs can transduce non-dividing cells like photoreceptors, a feature not shared by all [retroviruses](@entry_id:175375). However, the semi-random nature of this integration carries an intrinsic risk of **[insertional mutagenesis](@entry_id:266513)**, where the vector may disrupt an essential host gene or activate a proto-oncogene. While the development of **Self-Inactivating (SIN)** vectors, which contain deletions in their Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) to abolish promoter activity, has mitigated some of this risk, it remains a primary safety concern relative to AAV [@problem_id:4676299].

**Adenovirus (Ad)** vectors were among the first to be developed for [gene therapy](@entry_id:272679). They are highly efficient at transducing a broad range of cell types, including non-dividing cells, and their genome also persists as a non-integrating episome. However, their utility in the retina is severely limited by their **high immunogenicity**. The adenoviral capsid and genome trigger potent innate and adaptive immune responses, leading to significant inflammation and rapid clearance of transduced cells. This results in transient transgene expression and potential ocular toxicity, making Ad vectors generally unsuitable for therapies requiring long-term, stable [protein production](@entry_id:203882) in the delicate retinal environment [@problem_id:4676302].

### AAV Vectorology: Fine-Tuning the Workhorse

Given its dominance in ocular gene therapy, AAV vector design has undergone significant refinement. A critical distinction exists between the standard **single-stranded AAV (ssAAV)** and the more engineered **self-complementary AAV (scAAV)** format. This choice represents a fundamental trade-off between expression kinetics and packaging capacity [@problem_id:4676271].

The genome packaged into an ssAAV vector is a single strand of DNA. For transcription to begin, the host cell's DNA polymerase machinery must synthesize the complementary strand to form a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) template. This second-strand synthesis is a known rate-limiting step, particularly in post-mitotic cells like photoreceptors, leading to a delay in the onset of transgene expression.

To overcome this limitation, scAAV vectors were developed. An scAAV genome is engineered with a mutated Inverted Terminal Repeat (ITR) that allows it to package a dimeric, inverted-repeat DNA strand. Upon release into the nucleus, this single strand rapidly folds back on itself to form a dsDNA molecule, bypassing the need for host-mediated synthesis. This results in a much faster onset of transgene expression, which can be advantageous for certain disease models.

This speed, however, comes at a significant cost to packaging capacity. The AAV capsid has a strict size limit of approximately $4.7$ kilobases (kb). For a standard ssAAV, the space available for the therapeutic expression cassette (promoter, gene, etc.) is the total capacity minus the size of the two flanking ITRs (each about $0.145$ kb).

Maximum ssAAV cassette size $\approx 4.7 \text{ kb} - 2 \times 0.145 \text{ kb} = 4.41 \text{ kb}$

Because an scAAV packages a dimeric genome, the unique genetic information it can carry is effectively halved. The same physical space within the [capsid](@entry_id:146810) must contain both the sense and antisense sequences of the expression cassette.

Maximum scAAV cassette size $\approx \frac{4.7 \text{ kb} - 2 \times 0.145 \text{ kb}}{2} \approx 2.205 \text{ kb}$

This trade-off is a critical design constraint. For a therapy requiring rapid [protein production](@entry_id:203882) where the gene and its regulatory elements are small (e.g., under $2.2$ kb), scAAV is an excellent choice. However, for larger genes, the higher capacity of ssAAV is indispensable [@problem_id:4676271].

### Therapeutic Payloads: A Strategic Overview

The choice of payload is dictated by the underlying [molecular pathology](@entry_id:166727) of the disease. Several distinct strategies have been developed, each suited to a different type of genetic defect [@problem_id:4676335].

**Gene Augmentation** is the classical and most straightforward approach. It involves delivering a functional copy of a gene (as a complementary DNA, or cDNA) to compensate for a defective one. This strategy is ideal for **autosomal recessive loss-of-function** diseases, where the patient lacks a working protein product. By providing a correct gene copy, the cell can produce the missing protein and restore function. Its success hinges on the gene's size fitting within the vector's capacity. For example, a recessive dystrophy caused by mutations in a $2.0$ kb gene is a perfect candidate for AAV-mediated gene augmentation. However, this strategy is ineffective for dominant diseases and infeasible for genes that exceed the vector's packaging limit, such as an $8.5$ kb gene that cannot be delivered by a standard single AAV [@problem_id:4676335].

**Antisense Splicing Modulation** targets defects at the RNA level. Some mutations, particularly deep intronic ones, create aberrant splice sites that lead to the inclusion of "pseudoexons" in the final messenger RNA (mRNA). This disrupts the reading frame and results in a non-functional protein. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are short, synthetic nucleic acid sequences designed to bind to a specific pre-mRNA sequence. By masking the cryptic splice site, an ASO can block the spliceosome from recognizing it, thereby restoring the correct splicing pattern and enabling the production of a full-length, functional protein from the patient's own gene. This is a highly precise and elegant solution for specific splicing defects [@problem_id:4676335].

**RNA Replacement** is another RNA-level strategy that serves as a valuable alternative when DNA-based therapies are not feasible. This approach involves delivering exogenous mRNA encoding the correct protein directly to the target cells. The primary advantage of this method is that it completely bypasses the limitations of vector packaging capacity associated with large genes. For a recessive disease caused by a very large gene (e.g., $8.5$ kb), where AAV delivery is impossible, RNA replacement offers a viable path to restoring the missing protein. The main drawback is the transient nature of mRNA; because RNA molecules are naturally degraded by the cell, this therapy would likely require repeated administrations [@problem_id:4676335].

**Gene Editing** represents a paradigm shift from augmentation to correction. Instead of adding a new gene, genome editing tools aim to directly modify the patient's existing DNA. This is particularly powerful for **autosomal dominant gain-of-function** diseases, where a mutant allele produces a toxic protein. In this case, simply adding a normal gene copy (augmentation) would not solve the problem. Instead, a genome editing approach can be used to specifically disrupt or "knock out" the toxic allele, thereby eliminating the source of pathology. This is often accomplished using CRISPR-based nucleases to create a targeted DNA break, which is then repaired in a way that inactivates the gene [@problem_id:4676335].

### DNA Repair Pathways: The Cell's Endogenous Machinery

The outcomes of most genome editing strategies are fundamentally governed by the cell's own DNA repair machinery. When a double-strand break (DSB) is introduced into DNA, cells primarily employ two major pathways to repair it: Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) and Homology-Directed Repair (HDR) [@problem_id:4676288].

**Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ)** is the dominant and most active DSB repair pathway in mammalian cells. It works by directly ligating the broken DNA ends back together. This process is fast and efficient but often imprecise, frequently resulting in small random insertions or deletions (collectively termed **indels**) at the repair site. A key feature of NHEJ is that it is active throughout all phases of the cell cycle, including the quiescent $G_0$ and pre-replicative $G_1$ phases. This makes it the default repair mechanism in post-mitotic cells like [photoreceptors](@entry_id:151500).

**Homology-Directed Repair (HDR)** is a high-fidelity repair mechanism that uses a homologous DNA sequence as a template to accurately restore the original sequence at the break site. In nature, the cell uses the intact [sister chromatid](@entry_id:164903) as a template. For this reason, the cellular machinery for HDR is almost exclusively active during the $S$ (synthesis) and $G_2$ (gap 2) phases of the cell cycle, when a replicated [sister chromatid](@entry_id:164903) is available. While we can supply an exogenous DNA donor template to guide the repair process for therapeutic purposes, the core cellular machinery remains cell-cycle-dependent.

A third, less prominent pathway is **Microhomology-Mediated End Joining (MMEJ)**, an alternative end-joining mechanism that uses short stretches of [sequence homology](@entry_id:169068) (5-25 base pairs) to align the broken ends before ligation. It is also an error-prone pathway, always resulting in a deletion.

This cell-cycle dependency has profound implications for [genome editing](@entry_id:153805) in the retina. Mature [photoreceptors](@entry_id:151500) and RPE are terminally differentiated or quiescent, respectively, meaning the vast majority of cells reside in the $G_0$ phase. For instance, in a typical adult retina, the fraction of photoreceptors in $S/G_2$ is effectively zero, and for RPE it may be as low as $2\%$ [@problem_id:4676288]. Consequently, in these post-mitotic targets, NHEJ is the overwhelmingly dominant repair pathway, while HDR is extremely inefficient. This presents a major barrier to gene editing strategies that aim to precisely correct a mutation using an HDR-based donor template.

### Nuclease-Based Editors: The CRISPR-Cas Toolbox

The revolution in genome editing was catalyzed by the discovery and engineering of the CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and CRISPR-associated) system. These systems function as "molecular scissors," using a guide RNA (gRNA) to direct a Cas nuclease to a specific location in the genome to create a DSB. The choice of nuclease involves trade-offs between size, targeting specificity, and targeting range [@problem_id:4676268].

A critical requirement for any Cas nuclease is the presence of a short DNA sequence known as a **Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM)** immediately next to the target site. The nuclease will only bind and cut if this specific PAM sequence is present. Different nucleases recognize different PAMs.

**Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9)** is the most widely used nuclease. It recognizes a simple $5'\text{–}\mathrm{NGG}\text{–}3'$ PAM (where 'N' is any nucleotide). Its relatively simple PAM means it can target a high density of sites in the genome. However, its [coding sequence](@entry_id:204828) is large, approximately $4.2$ kb. When combined with a promoter ($~0.5$ kb) and a gRNA cassette ($~0.3$ kb), the total payload size of $~5.0$ kb exceeds the $4.7$ kb capacity of a single AAV vector. This often necessitates more complex dual-vector delivery strategies.

**Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9)** is a significantly smaller ortholog, with a [coding sequence](@entry_id:204828) of only about $3.2$ kb. This compact size allows it to be easily packaged into a single AAV vector along with its necessary regulatory elements ($3.2 + 0.5 + 0.3 = 4.0$ kb). This is a major practical advantage. The trade-off is that it recognizes a more complex PAM sequence, $5'\text{–}\mathrm{NNGRRT}\text{–}3'$ (where 'R' is a purine, A or G), which is less common in the genome, thus restricting its targeting range compared to SpCas9.

**Cas12a (formerly Cpf1)**, such as AsCas12a from *Acidaminococcus sp.*, represents another class of nuclease. It is intermediate in size ($~3.9$ kb) and recognizes a T-rich PAM, $5'\text{–}\mathrm{TTTV}\text{–}3'$ (where 'V' is A, C, or G). This provides an alternative targeting range, which is particularly useful in AT-rich genomic regions. Its size ($3.9 + 0.5 + 0.3 = 4.7$ kb) makes it borderline but feasible for single-AAV delivery.

The selection of a nuclease for a specific application requires careful consideration of these properties. For example, in a hypothetical $10$ kb gene segment with a specific base composition ($p_A=0.3, p_T=0.3, p_G=0.2, p_C=0.2$), one can estimate the number of available target sites. SpCas9 ($5'\text{–}\mathrm{NGG}\text{–}3'$) would have the highest density of sites ($~400$), but would not fit in one AAV. SaCas9 ($5'\text{–}\mathrm{NNGRRT}\text{–}3'$) would have fewer sites ($~150$), but would fit easily. Cas12a ($5'\text{–}\mathrm{TTTV}\text{–}3'$) would offer an intermediate number of sites ($~189$) and just barely fit in a single AAV [@problem_id:4676268].

### Advanced Editing Modalities: Precision Beyond the Double-Strand Break

The limitations of DSB-dependent editing—namely, the reliance on inefficient HDR for precise correction in post-mitotic cells and the generation of unwanted indels by NHEJ—have driven the development of more sophisticated editing technologies that do not require a DSB.

**Base Editors** are fusion proteins that combine a catalytically impaired Cas9 with a DNA deaminase enzyme, enabling the direct chemical conversion of one DNA base to another without creating a DSB.

*   **Cytosine Base Editors (CBEs)** fuse a Cas9 nickase (nCas9, which cuts only one DNA strand) to a cytidine [deaminase](@entry_id:201617) (e.g., APOBEC). The nCas9-gRNA complex unwinds the DNA at the target site, creating an "R-loop." The deaminase then converts a cytosine (C) to a uracil (U) on the exposed single strand of DNA. This U:G mismatch is then resolved by the cell's repair machinery, preferentially using the nicked strand as the template for repair, to become a T:A base pair. CBEs thus mediate C:G → T:A transition mutations. This activity is confined to an "editing window" of a few bases, typically around positions 4–8 of the protospacer (counting from the PAM-distal end) [@problem_id:4676331].

*   **Adenine Base Editors (ABEs)** operate on a similar principle, fusing nCas9 to an evolved adenosine deaminase (TadA) that acts on single-stranded DNA. It converts an adenine (A) to an inosine (I), which cellular machinery reads as guanine (G). This results in the conversion of an A:T base pair to a G:C base pair. ABEs also have a constrained editing window, often near positions 4–7 of the protospacer [@problem_id:4676331].

For both CBEs and ABEs, the orientation of the PAM is critical, as it determines which DNA strand is exposed for [deamination](@entry_id:170839) and therefore which specific bases fall within the editable window.

**Prime Editors (PEs)** represent a "search-and-replace" technology of even greater versatility. PEs are a fusion of a Cas9 nickase (which nicks the non-target strand) and a reverse transcriptase enzyme. They are directed by an engineered **[prime editing](@entry_id:152056) guide RNA (pegRNA)**, which not only targets a genomic site but also contains a primer binding site (PBS) and a reverse transcriptase template encoding the desired edit. After the nickase cuts one strand, the exposed 3' end of the DNA binds to the pegRNA's PBS and primes the [reverse transcriptase](@entry_id:137829) to synthesize a new stretch of DNA containing the edit, using the pegRNA's template. This newly synthesized "flap" is then integrated by the cell's repair machinery. Unlike base editors, which are limited to transition mutations, [prime editing](@entry_id:152056) can install all 12 types of single-base substitutions, as well as small insertions and deletions, all without creating a DSB [@problem_id:4676331].

These advanced, DSB-independent technologies are particularly well-suited for post-mitotic cells. Another strategy, **Homology-Independent Targeted Integration (HITI)**, cleverly co-opts the dominant NHEJ pathway. A HITI donor cassette is designed with CRISPR target sites flanking the payload. When Cas9 cuts both the genome and the donor, the cell's NHEJ machinery ligates the donor into the genomic break. By designing the target sites such that a mis-oriented integration recreates a cuttable configuration, the system can iteratively re-cleave until the donor is integrated in the correct, non-cuttable orientation.

By avoiding reliance on the inactive HDR pathway, HITI and [prime editing](@entry_id:152056) can achieve far greater efficiency for precise gene correction in post-mitotic [photoreceptors](@entry_id:151500). A quantitative model shows that while the expected yield of HDR might be on the order of $10^{-4}$ (due to the very small fraction of cells in $S/G_2$), the yield for HITI could be around $4.5 \times 10^{-2}$ and for [prime editing](@entry_id:152056) around $1 \times 10^{-1}$—several orders of magnitude higher [@problem_id:4676322].

### Delivery Routes and Anatomical Barriers

Developing an effective vector and payload is only half the battle; the therapeutic agent must successfully navigate the complex anatomy of the eye to reach its target cells. The choice of injection route is a critical determinant of efficacy and safety, governed by the principles of [mass transport](@entry_id:151908) across biological barriers [@problem_id:4676338].

The flux ($J$) of a vector across a barrier can be modeled by a simplified form of Fick's law: $J = P \cdot (C_1 - C_2)$, where $P$ is the permeability coefficient of the barrier and $C_1$ and $C_2$ are the concentrations on either side. The permeability itself is defined as $P = DK/\delta$, where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $K$ is the [partition coefficient](@entry_id:177413) (a measure of how readily the vector enters the barrier material), and $\delta$ is the barrier thickness.

**Intravitreal (IVT) Injection** places the vector into the vitreous cavity. To reach [photoreceptors](@entry_id:151500), the vector must traverse the entire neural retina, including the formidable **Inner Limiting Membrane (ILM)**. The ILM is a dense basement membrane that acts as a significant barrier to large molecules like AAV. For a typical AAV, its [partition coefficient](@entry_id:177413) across the ILM ($K_{\mathrm{ILM}}$) is very low (e.g., $10^{-3}$) due to steric and electrostatic hindrance. This results in a very low permeability, $P_{\mathrm{ILM}}$, severely limiting the flux of vector to the outer retina.

**Subretinal (SR) Injection** involves a surgical procedure to inject the vector directly into the space between the [photoreceptors](@entry_id:151500) and the RPE. This procedure creates a temporary, localized retinal detachment (a "bleb"). Its primary advantage is that it **bypasses the ILM** entirely, placing a high concentration of vector in immediate proximity to the target photoreceptor outer segments and the RPE apical surface. The resistance to transduction from this location is minimal, resulting in a very high effective permeability and efficient [transduction](@entry_id:139819) within the bleb. For a vector that is blocked by the ILM, SR delivery is therefore the preferred route for targeting outer retinal cells [@problem_id:4676338].

**Suprachoroidal (SC) Injection** is a less invasive alternative that places the vector into the space between the sclera and the choroid. From here, the vector must traverse the choroid, Bruch's membrane, and the RPE to reach the [photoreceptors](@entry_id:151500) from the "outside-in." This path is obstructed by the **outer blood-retinal barrier**, primarily the [tight junctions](@entry_id:143539) of the RPE. While the permeability of this barrier ($P_{\mathrm{RPE/BM}}$) is typically higher than that of the ILM for AAV ($K_{\mathrm{RPE/BM}}$ might be $10^{-2}$ vs $K_{\mathrm{ILM}}$ of $10^{-3}$), it still represents a significant hurdle. Suprachoroidal delivery could become a viable strategy for photoreceptor targeting under specific conditions, such as if the outer barrier is pathologically weakened (reducing effective $\delta$) or if AAV capsids are engineered with enhanced ability to cross the RPE (increasing $K_{\mathrm{RPE/BM}}$) [@problem_id:4676338].

### Ocular Immune Privilege and Vector Immunogenicity

The eye is not simply a passive container for these biological drugs; it possesses a unique and dynamic immunological environment. The concept of **ocular [immune privilege](@entry_id:186106)** refers to the eye's capacity to tolerate the presence of foreign antigens without eliciting a destructive inflammatory response, a mechanism evolved to protect the delicate neural tissue of the retina from bystander damage [@problem_id:4676307].

This privilege is not an absolute absence of immunity but rather a multi-layered system comprising:
1.  **Anatomical Barriers**: The blood-retinal barrier (BRB) physically isolates the retina from systemic [immune surveillance](@entry_id:153221).
2.  **Lack of Conventional Lymphatics**: The posterior segment lacks classical lymphatic vessels, which limits the drainage of antigens to lymph nodes where systemic immune responses are typically initiated.
3.  **Active Immunomodulation**: The ocular microenvironment is rich in immunosuppressive factors like Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-$\beta$). Cells like the RPE actively suppress immune responses by expressing cell-surface molecules such as Fas Ligand (FasL) and PD-L1, which can induce apoptosis or exhaustion in infiltrating T-cells [@problem_id:4676307].

Despite this privilege, innate and adaptive immune responses to [gene therapy vectors](@entry_id:198992) can and do occur. The innate immune system can be triggered by vector components. For instance, **Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9)**, expressed on retinal microglia and other cells, recognizes unmethylated CpG motifs present in the AAV genome, leading to inflammatory cytokine production. The [complement system](@entry_id:142643) can also be activated by the AAV capsid [@problem_id:4676307].

The choice of delivery route significantly influences the immunological risk profile. The subretinal space is considered more highly privileged than the vitreous. Subretinal delivery sequesters the vector behind the BRB, minimizing systemic exposure and antigen drainage. In contrast, intravitreal injection exposes the vector to greater communication with the systemic circulation via the ciliary body and aqueous outflow pathways. This makes pre-existing **neutralizing antibodies (NAbs)** against the AAV capsid—common in the human population due to natural exposure to wild-type AAV—a much more significant barrier for intravitreal delivery, as circulating antibodies can enter the vitreous and neutralize the vector before it reaches its target [@problem_id:4676307].

### Long-Term Safety Considerations: Integration and Mobilization

A paramount concern in gene therapy is long-term safety, particularly the risks of [insertional mutagenesis](@entry_id:266513) and vector mobilization [@problem_id:4676299].

**Insertional Mutagenesis** is the risk that the vector's genetic material integrates into the host genome and causes harm, for example, by disrupting a tumor suppressor gene. As discussed previously, this risk is fundamentally different for AAV and LV. SIN-LVs are designed to integrate, making [insertional mutagenesis](@entry_id:266513) an inherent, albeit minimized, risk. The integration is not entirely random; it is often biased towards transcriptionally active genes, which increases the chance of perturbing [gene function](@entry_id:274045). In contrast, recombinant AAV vectors are considered non-integrating, with the vast majority of genomes persisting as [episomes](@entry_id:182435). The rate of random integration is very low. However, this risk is not zero. Notably, the co-delivery of a DSB-inducing nuclease like Cas9 can significantly increase the rate of AAV integration at the site of the break via NHEJ, a factor that must be considered when designing [genome editing](@entry_id:153805) therapies [@problem_id:4676299].

**Vector Mobilization** refers to the risk that a replication-incompetent therapeutic vector could be "rescued" and packaged into new viral particles if a cell is subsequently infected with a wild-type "helper" virus. For AAV, this would require the cell to be co-infected with both a wild-type AAV (to provide the Rep and Cap proteins) and a helper virus (like adenovirus or [herpesvirus](@entry_id:171251)). The probability of this confluence of events occurring in a human retina is extremely low, making AAV mobilization a remote risk. Similarly, for LV, stringent manufacturing processes that use multiple [plasmids](@entry_id:139477) to produce the vector are designed to minimize the chance of generating a replication-competent [lentivirus](@entry_id:267285) (RCL). Both vectors are therefore considered to have a very low risk of mobilization in a clinical setting [@problem_id:4676299].
