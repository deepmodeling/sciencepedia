The Goldmann equation is a standard, albeit simplified, model used in ophthalmology. The premise that increased TGF-$\\beta$2 signaling leads to increased trabecular meshwork resistance is a central and well-documented mechanism in the pathophysiology of primary open-angle glaucoma. The numerical values provided are within accepted physiological ranges.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

The units are consistent throughout: $F_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $F_{u}$ are in $\\mu\\text{L/min}$, $P_{e}$ and $\\mathrm{IOP}$ are in mmHg, and $C$ is in $\\mu\\text{L/min/mmHg}$, satisfying the dimensional balance of the Goldmann equation.\n- **Realism**: The premise of resistance doubling is a plausible pathological change in the context of glaucoma progression.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. It is deemed **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the tasks outlined in the problem statement. All derivations begin from the provided fundamental equations.\n\nFirst, we derive the new outflow facility, $C_{1}$. The relationship between outflow facility $C$ and hydraulic resistance $R$ is given as $C = 1/R$.\nThe baseline resistance, $R_{0}$, is the inverse of the baseline facility, $C_{0}$:\n$$R_{0} = \\frac{1}{C_{0}}$$\nThe problem states that under sustained TGF-$\\beta$2 exposure, the resistance doubles. The new resistance, $R_{1}$, is therefore:\n$$R_{1} = 2R_{0} = \\frac{2}{C_{0}}$$\nThe new outflow facility, $C_{1}$, is the inverse of the new resistance, $R_{1}$:\n$$C_{1} = \\frac{1}{R_{1}} = \\frac{1}{2/C_{0}} = \\frac{C_{0}}{2}$$\nThis is the expression for the new outflow facility. Given $C_{0} = 0.3 \\ \\mu\\text{L/min/mmHg}$, the value of $C_1$ is:\n$$C_{1} = \\frac{0.3}{2} = 0.15 \\ \\mu\\text{L/min/mmHg}$$\n\nNext, we derive the general expression for intraocular pressure (IOP) by rearranging the Goldmann equation:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{in}} = C(\\mathrm{IOP} - P_{e}) + F_{u}$$\nThe flow through the conventional (trabecular) outflow pathway is $F_{\\mathrm{in}} - F_{u}$.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{in}} - F_{u} = C(\\mathrm{IOP} - P_{e})$$\nDividing by $C$ and isolating $\\mathrm{IOP}$ gives:\n$$\\frac{F_{\\mathrm{in}} - F_{u}}{C} = \\mathrm{IOP} - P_{e}$$\n$$\\mathrm{IOP} = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{in}} - F_{u}}{C} + P_{e}$$\nThis is the general expression for $\\mathrm{IOP}$.\n\nUsing this general expression, we can write the expressions for the baseline intraocular pressure, $\\mathrm{IOP}_{0}$, and the post-change intraocular pressure, $\\mathrm{IOP}_{1}$:\n$$\\mathrm{IOP}_{0} = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{in}} - F_{u}}{C_{0}} + P_{e}$$\n$$\\mathrm{IOP}_{1} = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{in}} - F_{u}}{C_{1}} + P_{e}$$\n\nNow, we compute the change in intraocular pressure, $\\Delta \\mathrm{IOP} = \\mathrm{IOP}_{1} - \\mathrm{IOP}_{0}$:\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{IOP} = \\left(\\frac{F_{\\mathrm{in}} - F_{u}}{C_{1}} + P_{e}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{F_{\\mathrm{in}} - F_{u}}{C_{0}} + P_{e}\\right)$$\nThe term $P_{e}$ cancels out:\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{IOP} = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{in}} - F_{u}}{C_{1}} - \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{in}} - F_{u}}{C_{0}}$$\nFactoring out the net conventional outflow term, $(F_{\\mathrm{in}} - F_{u})$:\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{IOP} = (F_{\\mathrm{in}} - F_{u})\\left(\\frac{1}{C_{1}} - \\frac{1}{C_{0}}\\right)$$\nWe can substitute our derived expression $C_{1} = C_{0}/2$ into this equation:\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{IOP} = (F_{\\mathrm{in}} - F_{u})\\left(\\frac{1}{C_{0}/2} - \\frac{1}{C_{0}}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{IOP} = (F_{\\mathrm{in}} - F_{u})\\left(\\frac{2}{C_{0}} - \\frac{1}{C_{0}}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{IOP} = (F_{\\mathrm{in}} - F_{u})\\left(\\frac{1}{C_{0}}\\right) = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{in}} - F_{u}}{C_{0}}$$\nThis elegant result gives the change in IOP purely in terms of the initial parameters.\n\nQualitatively, since aqueous humor must be produced and flow out of the eye for it to be a viable system, $F_{\\mathrm{in}} > F_{u}$. Also, the outflow facility $C_{0}$ must be positive. Therefore, the term $\\frac{F_{\\mathrm{in}} - F_{u}}{C_{0}}$ is positive, which means $\\Delta \\mathrm{IOP} > 0$. Qualitatively, the intraocular pressure **increases**. This is consistent with the pathology described, where increased resistance to outflow causes a buildup of pressure.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $\\Delta \\mathrm{IOP}$ using the provided values:\n$F_{\\mathrm{in}} = 2.5 \\ \\mu\\text{L/min}$\n$F_{u} = 0.5 \\ \\mu\\text{L/min}$\n$C_{0} = 0.3 \\ \\mu\\text{L/min/mmHg}$\n\nSubstituting these into our derived expression for $\\Delta \\mathrm{IOP}$:\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{IOP} = \\frac{2.5 - 0.5}{0.3} = \\frac{2.0}{0.3}$$\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{IOP} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.6666... \\ \\text{mmHg}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{IOP} \\approx 6.667 \\ \\text{mmHg}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.667}$$", "id": "4692759"}, {"introduction": "Before a gene can be studied as a biomarker, it must first be linked to the disease.

The TBK1 duplication is very rare in the general population, so no homozygotes are expected in this pedigree. All listed individuals are older than the age threshold at which $f_{1}$ applies. \n\nThe observed genotypes (presence or absence of the TBK1 duplication) and phenotypes (affected or unaffected with NTG) are:\n\n- Generation I:\n  - I-1: duplication carrier, affected.\n  - I-2: non-carrier, unaffected.\n- Generation II (children of I-1 and I-2):\n  - II-1: duplication carrier, affected.\n  - II-2: duplication carrier, unaffected.\n  - II-3: non-carrier, unaffected.\n- Generation II spouse and Generation III (children of II-1 with an unrelated unaffected non-carrier spouse II-4):\n  - II-4: non-carrier, unaffected.\n  - III-1: duplication carrier, affected.\n  - III-2: non-carrier, unaffected.\n\nAssume the coupling phase in I-1 is such that the NTG susceptibility allele (if present at a distinct disease locus) is on the same chromosomal homolog as the TBK1 duplication.

We denote the duplication allele as $M$ and the normal allele as $m$.\n- **Disease Locus**: A hypothetical susceptibility allele, denoted $D$, and a normal allele, $d$.\n- **Penetrance**: The probability of being affected for a carrier of the disease allele $D$ is $f_{1} = P(\\text{Affected} | D/d) = 0.6$. Consequently, the probability of being unaffected is $1 - f_{1} = 0.4$.\n- **Phenocopy Rate**: The probability of being affected for a non-carrier of the disease allele $D$ is $f_{0} = P(\\text{Affected} | d/d) = 0$. Consequently, the probability of being unaffected is $1 - f_{0} = 1$.\n- **Founder I-1**: Carrier of the duplication ($M/m$) and affected. His genotype is assumed to be $D/d$. The problem specifies a coupling phase, meaning his haplotypic constitution is $(DM)/(dm)$.\n- **Founder I-2**: Non-carrier of the duplication ($m/m$) and unaffected. Her genotype is $d/d$, and her haplotype is $(dm)/(dm)$.\n- **Spouse II-4**: Unrelated, unaffected non-carrier.

The association of TBK1 with glaucoma is a subject of scientific research. The setup is scientifically plausible.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary information (pedigree structure, genotypes, phenotypes, penetrance model, founder phase) to calculate the likelihood and, subsequently, the LOD score. The question is specific and has a unique answer.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language.\n\nThe potential ambiguity regarding the TBK1 duplication being a marker for a \"distinct disease locus\" versus being the causal mutation itself is a standard feature of linkage analysis. The LOD score framework is designed to test for linkage by modeling a marker and a hypothetical disease locus separated by a recombination fraction $\\theta$. The case $\\theta=0$ represents perfect linkage, which is functionally equivalent to the marker being the disease gene itself. Thus, there is no contradiction. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed to Solution\n\nTo compute $Z(0)$, we first need to derive the likelihood function $L(\\text{data}|\\theta)$, which is the probability of observing the phenotypes and genotypes of the five specified offspring, given the model parameters.\n\nThe total likelihood of the pedigree can be factored by sibships and independent branches. The offspring II-2 and II-3 are independent of the lineage descending from II-1. The likelihood is thus:\n$$L(\\text{data} | \\theta) = P(O_{II-2}) \\times P(O_{II-3}) \\times P(O_{II-1}, O_{III-1}, O_{III-2})$$\nwhere $O_i$ denotes the observation for individual $i$. The joint probability for the II-1 lineage must be computed by summing over the unobserved full genotypes of II-1, using the law of total probability, as formalized by the Elston-Stewart algorithm.\n\nThe mating I-1 ($(DM)/(dm)$) x I-2 ($(dm)/(dm)$) produces four types of gametes from I-1:\n- Non-recombinant gamete $(DM)$ with probability $\\frac{1-\\theta}{2}$.\n- Non-recombinant gamete $(dm)$ with probability $\\frac{1-\\theta}{2}$.\n- Recombinant gamete $(Dm)$ with probability $\\frac{\\theta}{2}$.\n- Recombinant gamete $(dM)$ with probability $\\frac{\\theta}{2}$.\nI-2 produces only $(dm)$ gametes.\n\nLet's calculate the probability (likelihood contribution) of observing each offspring type from such a mating.\n\n1.  **Carrier, Affected (e.g., II-1, III-1)**:\n    - Inherits $M$.

All necessary data, coefficients, and definitions are provided.\n\nThe objective is to compute a two-sided $p$-value for the difference in AUC between two models, $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}$, using DeLong's method.\n\nThe number of cases is $n_{1} = 3$ and the number of controls is $n_{0} = 3$.\n\n**Task 1: Compute model scores (linear predictors)**\n\nThe score for the clinical model, $\\mathcal{C}$, is given by the linear predictor $S_{\\mathcal{C}} = \\alpha_{\\mathcal{C}} + \\beta_{A,\\mathcal{C}} A + \\beta_{T,\\mathcal{C}} T$.\nUsing the provided coefficients $\\alpha_{\\mathcal{C}} = -14$, $\\beta_{A,\\mathcal{C}} = 0.03$, and $\\beta_{T,\\mathcal{C}} = 0.18$, we calculate the scores for each subject.\n\nThe score for the clinical-plus-PRS model, $\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}$, is $S_{\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}} = \\alpha_{\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}} + \\beta_{A,\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}} A + \\beta_{T,\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}} T + \\beta_{G} G$.\nUsing the coefficients $\\alpha_{\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}} = -14.2$, $\\beta_{A,\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}} = 0.03$, $\\beta_{T,\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}} = 0.17$, and $\\beta_{G} = 0.8$, we calculate the scores.\n\nFor example, for subject $\\mathrm{C1}$ ($A = 55, T = 18, G = -0.5$):\n$S_{\\mathcal{C}}(\\mathrm{C1}) = -14 + (0.03)(55) + (0.18)(18) = -14 + 1.65 + 3.24 = -9.11$\n$S_{\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}}(\\mathrm{C1}) = -14.2 + (0.03)(55) + (0.17)(18) + (0.8)(-0.5) = -14.2 + 1.65 + 3.06 - 0.4 = -9.89$\n\nThe scores for all subjects are:\nControls:\n- $\\mathrm{C1}$: $S_{\\mathcal{C}} = -9.11$, $S_{\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}} = -9.89$\n- $\\mathrm{C2}$: $S_{\\mathcal{C}} = -8.30$, $S_{\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}} = -8.86$\n- $\\mathrm{C3}$: $S_{\\mathcal{C}} = -9.08$, $S_{\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}} = -9.45$\n\nCases:\n- $\\mathrm{K4}$: $S_{\\mathcal{C}} = -7.73$, $S_{\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}} = -7.53$\n- $\\mathrm{K5}$: $S_{\\mathcal{C}} = -8.42$, $S_{\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}} = -8.43$\n- $\\mathrm{K6}$: $S_{\\mathcal{C}} = -8.84$, $S_{\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}} = -8.27$\n\n**Task 2: Compute AUCs and their difference**\n\nThe AUC is calculated as the probability that a randomly chosen case has a higher score than a randomly chosen control. With $n_1=3$ cases and $n_0=3$ controls, there are $n_1 n_0 = 9$ pairs.\n$\\mathrm{AUC} = \\frac{1}{n_{1}n_{0}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{1}} \\sum_{j=1}^{n_{0}} \\Psi(S(\\text{case}_i), S(\\text{control}_j))$, where $\\Psi(a,b)=1$ if $a>b$, $0.5$ if $a=b$, and $0$ if $a<b$.\n\nFor model $\\mathcal{C}$:\n- Case scores: $\\{-7.73, -8.42, -8.84\\}$.\n- Control scores: $\\{-9.11, -8.30, -9.08\\}$.\n- Case $\\mathrm{K4}$ ($-7.73$) > all $3$ controls.\n- Case $\\mathrm{K5}$ ($-8.42$) > controls $\\mathrm{C1}$ ($-9.11$) and $\\mathrm{C3}$ ($-9.08$), but < control $\\mathrm{C2}$ ($-8.30$). ($2$ wins).\n- Case $\\mathrm{K6}$ ($-8.84$) > controls $\\mathrm{C1}$ ($-9.11$) and $\\mathrm{C3}$ ($-9.08$), but < control $\\mathrm{C2}$ ($-8.30$). ($2$ wins).\nTotal wins = $3 + 2 + 2 = 7$.\n$\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathcal{C}} = \\frac{7}{9}$.\n\nFor model $\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}$:\n- Case scores: $\\{-7.53, -8.43, -8.27\\}$.\n- Control scores: $\\{-9.89, -8.86, -9.45\\}$.\nEach case score is greater than every control score.\nTotal wins = $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n$\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}} = \\frac{9}{9} = 1$.\n\nThe improvement in AUC is $\\Delta \\mathrm{AUC} = \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}} - \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathcal{C}} = 1 - \\frac{7}{9} = \\frac{2}{9}$.\n\n**Task 3: Apply DeLong’s method**\n\nLet model $\\mathcal{C}$ be model $1$ and $\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}$ be model $2$.\nFirst, we compute the placement values for each subject and each model.\nThe placement value for case $i$ is $V_i^{(k)} = \\frac{1}{n_0} \\sum_{j=1}^{n_0} \\Psi(S^{(k)}(\\text{case}_i), S^{(k)}(\\text{control}_j))$.\nThe placement value for control $j$ is $W_j^{(k)} = \\frac{1}{n_1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} \\Psi(S^{(k)}(\\text{case}_i), S^{(k)}(\\text{control}_j))$.\n\nFor model $1$ ($\\mathcal{C}$):\n- $V_{\\mathrm{K4}}^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{3}(1+1+1) = 1$\n- $V_{\\mathrm{K5}}^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{3}(1+0+1) = \\frac{2}{3}$\n- $V_{\\mathrm{K6}}^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{3}(1+0+1) = \\frac{2}{3}$\n- $W_{\\mathrm{C1}}^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{3}(1+1+1) = 1$\n- $W_{\\mathrm{C2}}^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{3}(1+0+0) = \\frac{1}{3}$\n- $W_{\\mathrm{C3}}^{(1)} = \\frac{1}{3}(1+1+1) = 1$\n\nFor model $2$ ($\\mathcal{C}+\\mathcal{G}$):\n- $V_{\\mathrm{K4}}^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{3}(1+1+1) = 1$\n- $V_{\\mathrm{K5}}^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{3}(1+1+1) = 1$\n- $V_{\\mathrm{K6}}^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{3}(1+1+1) = 1$\n- $W_{\\mathrm{C1}}^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{3}(1+1+1) = 1$\n- $W_{\\mathrm{C2}}^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{3}(1+1+1) = 1$\n- $W_{\\mathrm{C3}}^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{3}(1+1+1) = 1$\n\nNext, we compute the differences in placement values for each subject: $L_i = V_i^{(2)} - V_i^{(1)}$ for cases and $M_j = W_j^{(2)} - W_j^{(1)}$ for controls.\n- Case differences: $L = (V_{\\mathrm{K4}}^{(2)}-V_{\\mathrm{K4}}^{(1)}, V_{\\mathrm{K5}}^{(2)}-V_{\\mathrm{K5}}^{(1)}, V_{\\mathrm{K6}}^{(2)}-V_{\\mathrm{K6}}^{(1)}) = (1-1, 1-\\frac{2}{3}, 1-\\frac{2}{3}) = (0, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$.\n- Control differences: $M = (W_{\\mathrm{C1}}^{(2)}-W_{\\mathrm{C1}}^{(1)}, W_{\\mathrm{C2}}^{(2)}-W_{\\mathrm{C2}}^{(1)}, W_{\\mathrm{C3}}^{(2)}-W_{\\mathrm{C3}}^{(1)}) = (1-1, 1-\\frac{1}{3}, 1-1) = (0, \\frac{2}{3}, 0)$.\n\nThe mean of the case differences is $\\bar{L} = \\frac{1}{3}(0 + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}) = \\frac{2}{9}$, which equals $\\Delta \\mathrm{AUC}$.\nThe mean of the control differences is $\\bar{M} = \\frac{1}{3}(0 + \\frac{2}{3} + 0) = \\frac{2}{9}$, also equalling $\\Delta \\mathrm{AUC}$.\n\nThe variance of the AUC difference is estimated as $\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}(\\Delta \\mathrm{AUC}) = \\frac{S_L^2}{n_1} + \\frac{S_M^2}{n_0}$, where $S_L^2$ and $S_M^2$ are the sample variances of the placement value differences.\n$S_L^2 = \\frac{1}{n_1-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} (L_i - \\bar{L})^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (0-\\frac{2}{9})^2 + (\\frac{1}{3}-\\frac{2}{9})^2 + (\\frac{1}{3}-\\frac{2}{9})^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{4}{81} + (\\frac{1}{9})^2 + (\\frac{1}{9})^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{4}{81} + \\frac{1}{81} + \\frac{1}{81} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{6}{81} \\right) = \\frac{3}{81} = \\frac{1}{27}$.\n\n$S_M^2 = \\frac{1}{n_0-1} \\sum_{j=1}^{n_0} (M_j - \\bar{M})^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (0-\\frac{2}{9})^2 + (\\frac{2}{3}-\\frac{2}{9})^2 + (0-\\frac{2}{9})^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{4}{81} + (\\frac{4}{9})^2 + \\frac{4}{81} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{4}{81} + \\frac{16}{81} + \\frac{4}{81} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{24}{81} \\right) = \\frac{12}{81} = \\frac{4}{27}$.\n\n$\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}(\\Delta \\mathrm{AUC}) = \\frac{1/27}{3} + \\frac{4/27}{3} = \\frac{1}{81} + \\frac{4}{81} = \\frac{5}{81}$.\n\nThe $z$-statistic is given by $z = \\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{AUC}}{\\sqrt{\\widehat{\\operatorname{Var}}(\\Delta \\mathrm{AUC})}}$.\n$z = \\frac{2/9}{\\sqrt{5/81}} = \\frac{2/9}{\\sqrt{5}/9} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}$.\nNumerically, $z \\approx 0.894427$.\n\nThe two-sided $p$-value is $p = 2 \\times P(Z > |z|)$, where $Z$ is a standard normal random variable.\n$p = 2 \\times (1 - \\Phi(|2/\\sqrt{5}|))$, where $\\Phi$ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.\n$p \\approx 2 \\times (1 - \\Phi(0.894427)) \\approx 2 \\times (1 - 0.814546) \\approx 2 \\times 0.185454 \\approx 0.370908$.\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the $p$-value is $0.3711$.\nThis high $p$-value suggests that, despite the observed increase in AUC from $7/9$ to $1$, the evidence for a statistically significant improvement is weak, which is expected given the extremely small sample size ($n_1=3, n_0=3$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3711}\n$$", "id": "4692756"}]}
