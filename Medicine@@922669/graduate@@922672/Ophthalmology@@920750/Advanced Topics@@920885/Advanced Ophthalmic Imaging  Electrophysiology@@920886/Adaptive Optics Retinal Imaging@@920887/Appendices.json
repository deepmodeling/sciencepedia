The various pieces of information (diffraction theory, Rayleigh criterion, NA definition) are mutually consistent and lead to a single, coherent result. The simplification $n \\approx 1$ is stated explicitly and does not create a contradiction within the problem's framework.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the diffraction-limited spot size on the retina, which is defined as the radius of the point-spread function (PSF) to its first minimum. For a diffraction-limited optical system with a circular aperture, the PSF is described by the Airy pattern.\n\nAccording to scalar diffraction theory, for a plane wave of wavelength $\\lambda$ incident on a circular aperture of diameter $D$, the angular position $\\theta$ of the first minimum in the resulting Fraunhofer diffraction pattern (the Airy pattern) is given by the relation:\n$$\n\\sin(\\theta) = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}\n$$\nThis angle $\\theta$ represents the angular radius of the central bright disk, known as the Airy disk.\n\nThe problem states that we may use the paraxial small-angle approximation. For small angles, $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$, where $\\theta$ is measured in radians. Applying this approximation, we get the angular radius of the Airy disk as:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\text{min}} \\approx 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}\n$$\nThe eye is modeled as a thin lens of focal length $f$. A distant point source is focused by this lens onto the retinal plane, which is the focal plane. The relationship between an angular size $\\theta_{\\text{min}}$ in object space (or, equivalently, the angular size of the diffraction spread) and the corresponding lateral size $r_{\\text{spot}}$ on the focal plane is given by:\n$$\nr_{\\text{spot}} = f \\tan(\\theta_{\\text{min}})\n$$\nAgain, invoking the small-angle approximation, which is valid in the paraxial regime, we have $\\tan(\\theta_{\\text{min}}) \\approx \\theta_{\\text{min}}$. This simplifies the relation to:\n$$\nr_{\\text{spot}} \\approx f \\theta_{\\text{min}}\n$$\nThis lateral distance $r_{\\text{spot}}$ is the radius from the center of the focused spot to the point corresponding to the angular position of the first minimum. By the problem's definition, this is the \"spot size.\"\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\theta_{\\text{min}}$ into the equation for $r_{\\text{spot}}$, we obtain the expression for the spot size on the retina:\n$$\nr_{\\text{spot}} \\approx f \\left( 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D} \\right)\n$$\nRearranging the terms gives the final expression for the diffraction-limited spot size:\n$$\nr_{\\text{spot}} = 1.22 \\frac{f \\lambda}{D}\n$$\nThis quantity also represents the minimal lateral resolution on the retina according to the Rayleigh criterion, which states that two point sources are just resolvable if the center of the Airy disk of one source is located on the first minimum of the Airy pattern of the second source. The minimum separation is therefore equal to the radius of the Airy disk.\n\nWe can verify this result using the provided information on the Numerical Aperture (NA). The theoretical resolution limit $r_{\\text{res}}$ in the image plane of an objective lens is given by:\n$$\nr_{\\text{res}} = \\frac{0.61 \\lambda_{\\text{medium}}}{\\text{NA}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies to use the free-space wavelength $\\lambda$ and an ocular medium refractive index $n \\approx 1$, so $\\lambda_{\\text{medium}} = \\lambda/n \\approx \\lambda$. The resolution $r_{\\text{res}}$ is equivalent to the spot size $r_{\\text{spot}}$. The problem also provides a specific approximation for the NA of the eye:\n$$\n\\text{NA} \\approx \\frac{D}{2f}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the resolution formula:\n$$\nr_{\\text{spot}} = \\frac{0.61 \\lambda}{D/(2f)} = \\frac{2f \\cdot 0.61 \\lambda}{D} = 1.22 \\frac{f \\lambda}{D}\n$$\nThis confirms the result obtained from the more fundamental geometric optics approach. The expression is dimensionally correct: given $f$, $\\lambda$, and $D$ in meters, the resulting $r_{\\text{spot}}$ will be in meters.\n$$\n\\frac{[\\text{m}] \\cdot [\\text{m}]}{[\\text{m}]} = [\\text{m}]\n$$\nThe final expression for the spot size is a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of the required variables $D$, $f$, and $\\lambda$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.22 \\frac{f \\lambda}{D}}\n$$", "id": "4649360"}, {"introduction": "Achieving diffraction-limited optical performance is only half the battle; the resulting high-resolution image must be properly captured by a digital detector. This practice delves into the critical concept of Nyquist sampling, ensuring that your digital sensor has a fine enough pixel grid to resolve the cellular-scale detail provided by the AO-corrected optics. You will connect the biological spacing of photoreceptors to the required system magnification, a crucial step in designing any high-resolution retinal imaging system [@problem_id:4649380].", "problem": "In an adaptive optics (AO) flood-illumination retinal imaging system designed to visualize the cone photoreceptor mosaic, you seek to ensure that the digital sampling at the detector is sufficient to resolve cones with a characteristic center-to-center spacing of $s$ on the retina.

It is based on established principles of signal processing (Shannon-Nyquist theorem) and geometric optics (linear magnification). All necessary parameters are provided, and the values given ($s = 3.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ for cone spacing, $p_{\\mathrm{det}} = 6.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ for pixel pitch) are physically realistic for foveal cones and common scientific detectors, respectively. The problem is free of contradictions or ambiguities and can be formalized into a solvable mathematical problem. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages as requested by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we state the Nyquist sampling requirement in the object plane, which is the retina. The Shannon–Nyquist sampling theorem dictates that to perfectly reconstruct a band-limited signal, the sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest frequency component of the signal. In spatial terms, this means the sampling interval must be at most half the period of the highest spatial frequency to be resolved. The cone mosaic is characterized by a center-to-center spacing of $s$. To resolve this structure, we must be able to resolve features with a spatial period of $s$. The highest spatial frequency of interest in the object plane is therefore $f_{\\mathrm{obj,max}} = \\frac{1}{s}$.\nLet the sampling interval in the object plane (the retina) be denoted by $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{obj}}$. The corresponding sampling frequency is $f_{\\mathrm{sample,obj}} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{obj}}}$. The Nyquist criterion is:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{sample,obj}} \\ge 2 f_{\\mathrm{obj,max}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the frequencies, we get:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{obj}}} \\ge \\frac{2}{s}$$\nRearranging this inequality for the sampling interval gives the Nyquist requirement in the object plane:\n$$\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{obj}} \\le \\frac{s}{2}$$\nThis means the effective sampling distance on the retina must be no larger than half the cone spacing.\n\nSecond, we derive the inequality for the magnification $M$. The detector has a square pixel pitch of $p_{\\mathrm{det}}$, which is the sampling interval in the image plane. The transverse linear magnification $M$ relates a distance in the object plane, $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{obj}}$, to the corresponding distance in the image plane, $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{image}}$, by the formula $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{image}} = M \\cdot \\Delta x_{\\mathrm{obj}}$. In our system, the detector pixels are sampling the image. We can conceptualize this as projecting the detector pixels back onto the retina to find the effective sampling interval in the object plane. A single pixel of size $p_{\\mathrm{det}}$ in the image plane corresponds to an effective sampling interval of $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{obj}}$ in the object plane. From the magnification formula, this effective sampling interval is:\n$$\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{obj}} = \\frac{\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{image}}}{M} = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{det}}}{M}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{obj}}$ into the Nyquist sampling requirement derived in the first step:\n$$\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{det}}}{M} \\le \\frac{s}{2}$$\nSince $M$, $s$, and $p_{\\mathrm{det}}$ are all positive physical quantities, we can rearrange the inequality to solve for $M$ without changing the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$2 p_{\\mathrm{det}} \\le M s$$\n$$M \\ge \\frac{2 p_{\\mathrm{det}}}{s}$$\nThis is the required inequality that the magnification $M$ must satisfy to ensure Nyquist sampling of the cone mosaic.\n\nThird, we compute the minimum magnification, $M_{\\mathrm{min}}$, that satisfies this condition for the given numerical values. The minimum magnification corresponds to the equality in the derived inequality:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{2 p_{\\mathrm{det}}}{s}$$\nWe are given the detector pixel pitch $p_{\\mathrm{det}} = 6.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and the target cone spacing $s = 3.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Substituting these values into the expression for $M_{\\mathrm{min}}$:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{2 \\times 6.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{3.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}$$\n$$M_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{13.0}{3.1}$$\nThe units of micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) cancel, leaving a dimensionless magnification factor as expected.\nPerforming the division:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{min}} \\approx 4.193548387...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$M_{\\mathrm{min}} \\approx 4.194$$\nThus, the minimum magnification required for the system to meet the Nyquist sampling criterion for the specified cone spacing and detector is approximately $4.194$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.194}$$", "id": "4649380"}, {"introduction": "Real-world imaging systems often face challenges not present in idealized models, and chromatic aberration is a prime example.
