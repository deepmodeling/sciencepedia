Light travels from air into the cornea and then into the aqueous humor. Assume monochromatic paraxial rays and small-angle conditions. Use the following refractive indices: air $n_{a} = 1.000$, corneal stroma $n_{c} = 1.376$, and aqueous humor $n_{h} = 1.336$. The geometric parameters are anterior radius $R_{a} = 7.80~\\text{mm}$, posterior radius $R_{p} = 6.50~\\text{mm}$, and central corneal thickness $t = 0.55~\\text{mm}$. Adopt the sign convention that, at each refracting interface, the radius $R$ is positive when the center of curvature lies in the direction of light propagation as seen from the incident medium, and negative otherwise. For the cornea, with light incident on the anterior surface from air and on the posterior surface from stroma, both $R_{a}$ and $R_{p}$ are positive under this convention.\n\nStarting from Snell’s law at a spherical interface and the paraxial approximation, first derive the paraxial anterior-surface power $P_{a}$ in terms of $n_{a}$, $n_{c}$, and $R_{a}$, and compute its numerical value.

The power of a surface, $P$, is defined for incident parallel rays, meaning the object is at infinity ($s \\to \\infty$). In this case, $\\frac{n_1}{s} \\to 0$, and the equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{n_2}{s'} = \\frac{n_2 - n_1}{R} $$\nHere, $s'$ is the secondary focal length, $f'$. The power $P$ is given by the expression on the right-hand side.\n\nFor the anterior surface of the cornea, light travels from air ($n_1 = n_a$) to the corneal stroma ($n_2 = n_c$). The radius is $R_a$.

The provided data are self-contained, consistent, and well within realistic clinical parameters. The problem is well-posed, objective, and asks for a specific, calculable quantity based on the provided first principles and assumptions.\n\nThe objective is to compute the residual stromal bed thickness ($T_{RSB}$) after a myopic LASIK procedure. This is given by the preoperative central corneal thickness ($T_{CCT}$) minus the flap thickness ($T_{flap}$) and the central ablation depth ($d_{central}$).\n$$T_{RSB} = T_{CCT} - T_{flap} - d_{central}$$\n\nThe given values are:\n- Preoperative central corneal thickness, $T_{CCT} = 560$ micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$).\n- Lamellar flap thickness, $T_{flap} = 110 \\mu\\text{m}$.\n- Myopic correction, which represents the magnitude of the power change, $P_{\\text{corr}} = 5.50$ diopters (D).\n- Optical zone diameter, $D_{OZ} = 6.2$ millimeters (mm), so the radius is $r_{OZ} = \\frac{D_{OZ}}{2} = 3.1$ mm.\n- Corneal refractive index, $n = 1.376$.\n- Air refractive index, $n_{\\text{air}} = 1.000$.\n\nThe primary task is to derive the central ablation depth, $d_{central}$. The problem states that the ablation is designed such that the tissue removal is maximal at the center and zero at the edge of the optical zone. This implies that the central ablation depth, $d_{central}$, corresponds to the difference in the sagittal depth of the preoperative and postoperative surfaces, measured at the edge of the optical zone.\n\nLet $s_{pre}(r)$ and $s_{post}(r)$ be the sagittal heights of the preoperative and postoperative anterior corneal surfaces, respectively, at a radial coordinate $r$. Using the provided paraxial approximation, $s(r) = \\frac{r^2}{2R}$, where $R$ is the radius of curvature.\n\nThe central ablation depth is the difference in sagitta at the edge of the optical zone ($r=r_{OZ}$):\n$$d_{central} = s_{pre}(r_{OZ}) - s_{post}(r_{OZ})$$\nA myopic correction flattens the cornea, so the postoperative radius $R_{post}$ is greater than the preoperative radius $R_{pre}$. This results in a smaller postoperative sagittal height ($s_{post}  s_{pre}$), ensuring $d_{central}$ is positive.\n\nSubstituting the formula for sagittal height:\n$$d_{central} = \\frac{r_{OZ}^2}{2 R_{pre}} - \\frac{r_{OZ}^2}{2 R_{post}} = \\frac{r_{OZ}^2}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{R_{pre}} - \\frac{1}{R_{post}} \\right)$$\n\nNext, we relate the radii of curvature to the optical power of the anterior corneal surface using the provided formula for a single refracting surface, $P = \\frac{n_2 - n_1}{R}$. For the anterior cornea separating air ($n_1 = n_{\\text{air}}$) from the cornea ($n_2 = n$), this becomes:\n$$P = \\frac{n - n_{\\text{air}}}{R}$$\nThis can be rearranged to express the reciprocal of the radius in terms of power:\n$$\\frac{1}{R} = \\frac{P}{n - n_{\\text{air}}}$$\nSo, we have $\\frac{1}{R_{pre}} = \\frac{P_{pre}}{n - n_{\\text{air}}}$ and $\\frac{1}{R_{post}} = \\frac{P_{post}}{n - n_{\\text{air}}}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $d_{central}$:\n$$d_{central} = \\frac{r_{OZ}^2}{2} \\left( \\frac{P_{pre}}{n - n_{\\text{air}}} - \\frac{P_{post}}{n - n_{\\text{air}}} \\right) = \\frac{r_{OZ}^2}{2(n - n_{\\text{air}})} (P_{pre} - P_{post})$$\n\nThe change in power, $\\Delta P$, is defined as $\\Delta P = P_{post} - P_{pre}$. A myopic correction of $P_{\\text{corr}} = 5.50$ D means the power of the cornea is reduced by this amount. Therefore, the change in power is negative:\n$$\\Delta P = -P_{\\text{corr}} = -5.50 \\text{ D}$$\nNote that $P_{pre} - P_{post} = -(P_{post} - P_{pre}) = -\\Delta P$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for $d_{central}$:\n$$d_{central} = \\frac{r_{OZ}^2 (-\\Delta P)}{2(n - n_{\\text{air}})}$$\nSubstituting $\\Delta P = -P_{\\text{corr}}$ gives the well-known Munnerlyn formula for myopic ablation:\n$$d_{central} = \\frac{r_{OZ}^2 P_{\\text{corr}}}{2(n - n_{\\text{air}})}$$\nThis is an alternative path arriving at the same result.

At this point, the term $(r-r_c)$ is zero, which simplifies the derivatives significantly.\n$$\nz'(r_c) = Ar_c + \\frac{h(r_c-r_c)}{\\sigma^2} \\exp(0) = Ar_c\n$$\n$$\nz''(r_c) = A + \\frac{h}{\\sigma^2}\\left[1 - 0\\right] \\exp(0) = A + \\frac{h}{\\sigma^2}\n$$\n\nNow we can write the expressions for the curvatures at $r=r_c$:\n$$\n\\kappa_t(r_c) = \\frac{z''(r_c)}{\\left[1 + (z'(r_c))^2\\right]^{3/2}} = \\frac{A + h/\\sigma^2}{\\left[1 + (Ar_c)^2\\right]^{3/2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa_a(r_c) = \\frac{z'(r_c)}{r_c\\sqrt{1+(z'(r_c))^2}} = \\frac{Ar_c}{r_c\\sqrt{1+(Ar_c)^2}} = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{1+(Ar_c)^2}}\n$$\n\nWe can now compute the ratio $\\kappa_a(r_c)/\\kappa_t(r_c)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\kappa_a(r_c)}{\\kappa_t(r_c)} = \\frac{A/\\sqrt{1+(Ar_c)^2}}{(A+h/\\sigma^2)/[1+(Ar_c)^2]^{3/2}} = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{1+(Ar_c)^2}} \\cdot \\frac{[1+(Ar_c)^2]^{3/2}}{A+h/\\sigma^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\kappa_a(r_c)}{\\kappa_t(r_c)} = \\frac{A}{A+h/\\sigma^2} \\cdot \\frac{[1+(Ar_c)^2]^{3/2}}{[1+(Ar_c)^2]^{1/2}} = \\frac{A\\left(1+(Ar_c)^2\\right)}{A+h/\\sigma^2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$A = 1/R_0 = 1/7.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}$\n$r_c = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n$h = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n$\\sigma = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, so $\\sigma^2 = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$.\n\nLet's evaluate the components of the ratio expression:\n$$\nAr_c = \\frac{1}{7.8} \\times 3.0 = \\frac{3.0}{7.8} = \\frac{30}{78} = \\frac{5}{13}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{h}{\\sigma^2} = \\frac{0.05}{0.25} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}\n$$\nSubstitute these into the ratio formula:\n$$\n\\frac{\\kappa_a(r_c)}{\\kappa_t(r_c)} = \\frac{A\\left(1+(Ar_c)^2\\right)}{A+h/\\sigma^2} = \\frac{(1/7.8)\\left(1+(5/13)^2\\right)}{1/7.8 + 0.2}\n$$\nTo avoid rounding errors, we work with fractions. $A = 1/7.8 = 10/78 = 5/39$. $h/\\sigma^2 = 0.2 = 1/5$.\n$$\nA + \\frac{h}{\\sigma^2} = \\frac{5}{39} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{25+39}{195} = \\frac{64}{195}\n$$\n$$\n1 + (Ar_c)^2 = 1 + \\left(\\frac{5}{13}\\right)^2 = 1 + \\frac{25}{169} = \\frac{169+25}{169} = \\frac{194}{169}\n$$\nNow substitute these back into the ratio calculation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\kappa_a(r_c)}{\\kappa_t(r_c)} = \\frac{A(1+(Ar_c)^2)}{A+h/\\sigma^2} = \\frac{(5/39)(194/169)}{64/195} = \\frac{5}{39} \\cdot \\frac{194}{169} \\cdot \\frac{195}{64}\n$$\nSince $195 = 5 \\times 39$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\kappa_a(r_c)}{\\kappa_t(r_c)} = \\frac{5}{39} \\cdot \\frac{194}{169} \\cdot \\frac{5 \\times 39}{64} = \\frac{25 \\times 194}{169 \\times 64} = \\frac{25 \\times (2 \\times 97)}{169 \\times (2 \\times 32)} = \\frac{25 \\times 97}{169 \\times 32} = \\frac{2425}{5408}\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the fractional underestimation $U$:\n$$\nU = 1 - \\frac{\\kappa_a(r_c)}{\\kappa_t(r_c)} = 1 - \\frac{2425}{5408} = \\frac{5408 - 2425}{5408} = \\frac{2983}{5408}\n$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$$\nU = \\frac{2983}{5408} \\approx 0.5515902366...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $0.5516$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5516}\n$$", "id": "4667536"}]}
