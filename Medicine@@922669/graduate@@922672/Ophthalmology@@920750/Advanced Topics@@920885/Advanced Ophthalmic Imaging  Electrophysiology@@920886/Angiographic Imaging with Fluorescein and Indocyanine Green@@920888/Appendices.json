A complete, reasoned solution will now be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe task is to compute two values: the total mass of fluorescein delivered to the patient and the dose normalized by the patient's body mass.\n\nFirst, we establish the concentration of the fluorescein sodium solution. The problem specifies that a $10\\%$ solution is defined as $10~\\mathrm{g}$ of solute per $100~\\mathrm{mL}$ of solution. Let the concentration be denoted by the symbol $C$.\n$$C = \\frac{10~\\mathrm{g}}{100~\\mathrm{mL}}$$\nThis expression for concentration simplifies to:\n$$C = 0.1~\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{mL}}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total mass of fluorescein, which we denote as $m_{\\text{total}}$, that is administered in an intravenous bolus with a volume $V_{\\text{bolus}} = 5~\\mathrm{mL}$. The total mass is determined by the product of the solution's concentration and the volume of the bolus.\n$$m_{\\text{total}} = C \\times V_{\\text{bolus}}$$\nSubstituting the known values into this equation:\n$$m_{\\text{total}} = \\left(0.1~\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{mL}}\\right) \\times (5~\\mathrm{mL})$$\nThe unit of volume, $\\mathrm{mL}$, cancels, yielding the mass in grams:\n$$m_{\\text{total}} = 0.5~\\mathrm{g}$$\n\nThe problem requires this total dose to be expressed in the unit of milligrams ($\\mathrm{mg}$). We apply the standard conversion factor $1~\\mathrm{g} = 1000~\\mathrm{mg}$.\n$$m_{\\text{total}} = 0.5~\\mathrm{g} \\times \\frac{1000~\\mathrm{mg}}{1~\\mathrm{g}}$$\n$$m_{\\text{total}} = 500~\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe problem directs that this result be reported to three significant figures. The calculated value is the integer $500$. This value can be represented with three significant figures as $5.00 \\times 10^2$. Therefore, the value reported to three significant figures is $500$.\n\nSecond, we calculate the normalized dose, $D_{\\text{norm}}$. This quantity is defined as the total mass of the administered drug per unit of patient body mass. The patient's body mass, $m_{\\text{patient}}$, is given as $70~\\mathrm{kg}$.\n$$D_{\\text{norm}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{total}}}{m_{\\text{patient}}}$$\nSubstituting the value of $m_{\\text{total}}$ in $\\mathrm{mg}$ and $m_{\\text{patient}}$ in $\\mathrm{kg}$:\n$$D_{\\text{norm}} = \\frac{500~\\mathrm{mg}}{70~\\mathrm{kg}}$$\n$$D_{\\text{norm}} = \\frac{50}{7}~\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg}}$$\nEvaluating this fraction gives a repeating decimal:\n$$D_{\\text{norm}} \\approx 7.142857...~\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg}}$$\n\nAs per the problem's instruction, this value must be rounded to three significant figures. Examining the fourth significant digit, which is $2$, we round down.\n$$D_{\\text{norm}} \\approx 7.14~\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg}}$$\n\nIn summary, the final calculated values are:\n-   The total dose of fluorescein is $500~\\mathrm{mg}$.\n-   The normalized dose is $7.14~\\mathrm{mg/kg}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 500  7.14 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4654177"}, {"introduction": "Angiography is a dynamic study, where changes in fluorescence over time reveal the underlying pathology.

For each modality, a circular region of interest is defined over a focal lesion in the macula and a second region of interest is placed over adjacent, lesion-free retina to serve as background. The measured fluorescence intensity in arbitrary units, corrected for instrument gain, is recorded over time. For FFA, intensities are sampled at $t = 0, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 600$ seconds. The background curve $I_{B}^{\\mathrm{FFA}}(t)$ yields $0, 45, 80, 95, 100, 98, 92$, and the lesion curve $I_{L}^{\\mathrm{FFA}}(t)$ yields $0, 50, 95, 130, 170, 220, 270$.

After a bolus of sodium fluorescein, the plasma concentration peaks and then decreases with time due to distribution and clearance. Under an intact blood–retinal barrier, extravascular fluorescence is negligible, and the tissue signal predominantly reflects intravascular dye, which approaches a plateau and then declines. When the barrier is disrupted, there is net flux $J$ of dye into extravascular space driven by a concentration gradient, consistent with Fick’s law $J \\propto -\\nabla C$, and a nonzero permeability–surface area product. If the intravascular concentration remains above zero, net accumulation continues, so the lesion signal can rise over late phases even as background plateaus or declines. Staining is retention of dye in tissue with a plateauing curve and minimal growth in the lesion–background difference. Pooling implies compartmental collection with characteristic late filling.\n\nDefine discrete derivatives. For each interval, we compute discrete differences $\\Delta I(t_{i}) = I(t_{i+1}) - I(t_{i})$ to approximate the time derivative sign, and we compute the lesion–background difference $\\Delta I_{LB}(t_{i}) = I_{L}(t_{i}) - I_{B}(t_{i})$ to assess divergence and plateauing.\n\nFundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) analysis.\n\nBackground FFA intensities $I_{B}^{\\mathrm{FFA}}(t)$ at $t = 0, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 600$ seconds are $0, 45, 80, 95, 100, 98, 92$. The discrete differences for background are:\n- From $t = 0$ to $t = 20$: $\\Delta I_{B}^{\\mathrm{FFA}} = 45 - 0 = 45$ (positive).\n- From $t = 20$ to $t = 40$: $\\Delta I_{B}^{\\mathrm{FFA}} = 80 - 45 = 35$ (positive).\n- From $t = 40$ to $t = 80$: $\\Delta I_{B}^{\\mathrm{FFA}} = 95 - 80 = 15$ (positive).\n- From $t = 80$ to $t = 160$: $\\Delta I_{B}^{\\mathrm{FFA}} = 100 - 95 = 5$ (small positive, approaching plateau).\n- From $t = 160$ to $t = 320$: $\\Delta I_{B}^{\\mathrm{FFA}} = 98 - 100 = -2$ (negative, washout).\n- From $t = 320$ to $t = 600$: $\\Delta I_{B}^{\\mathrm{FFA}} = 92 - 98 = -6$ (negative, continued washout).\n\nLesion FFA intensities $I_{L}^{\\mathrm{FFA}}(t)$ are $0, 50, 95, 130, 170, 220, 270$. The discrete differences for the lesion are:\n- From $t = 0$ to $t = 20$: $\\Delta I_{L}^{\\mathrm{FFA}} = 50 - 0 = 50$ (positive).\n- From $t = 20$ to $t = 40$: $\\Delta I_{L}^{\\mathrm{FFA}} = 95 - 50 = 45$ (positive).\n- From $t = 40$ to $t = 80$: $\\Delta I_{L}^{\\mathrm{FFA}} = 130 - 95 = 35$ (positive).\n- From $t = 80$ to $t = 160$: $\\Delta I_{L}^{\\mathrm{FFA}} = 170 - 130 = 40$ (positive).\n- From $t = 160$ to $t = 320$: $\\Delta I_{L}^{\\mathrm{FFA}} = 220 - 170 = 50$ (positive).\n- From $t = 320$ to $t = 600$: $\\Delta I_{L}^{\\mathrm{FFA}} = 270 - 220 = 50$ (positive).\n\nThus, while background approaches a plateau and then declines in late phases, the lesion shows sustained positive increments across all intervals, including late phases. Now compute lesion–background differences at each time to assess divergence and plateauing:\n- At $t = 20$: $\\Delta I_{LB}^{\\mathrm{FFA}} = 50 - 45 = 5$.\n- At $t = 40$: $\\Delta I_{LB}^{\\mathrm{FFA}} = 95 - 80 = 15$.\n- At $t = 80$: $\\Delta I_{LB}^{\\mathrm{FFA}} = 130 - 95 = 35$.\n- At $t = 160$: $\\Delta I_{LB}^{\\mathrm{FFA}} = 170 - 100 = 70$.\n- At $t = 320$: $\\Delta I_{LB}^{\\mathrm{FFA}} = 220 - 98 = 122$.\n- At $t = 600$: $\\Delta I_{LB}^{\\mathrm{FFA}} = 270 - 92 = 178$.\n\nThe lesion–background difference increases monotonically and does not plateau; it accelerates in late phases because background washes out while lesion continues to accumulate. This is the kinetic signature of leakage in FFA, consistent with persistent extravascular accumulation due to barrier breakdown and a continuing concentration gradient between plasma and tissue dye compartments.\n\nIndocyanine green angiography (ICGA) analysis.\n\nBackground ICGA intensities $I_{B}^{\\mathrm{ICGA}}(t)$ are $0, 25, 50, 65, 70, 68, 62$ with differences:\n- $0 \\rightarrow 20$: $25 - 0 = 25$ (positive).\n- $20 \\rightarrow 40$: $50 - 25 = 25$ (positive).\n- $40 \\rightarrow 80$: $65 - 50 = 15$ (positive).\n- $80 \\rightarrow 160$: $70 - 65 = 5$ (small positive).\n- $160 \\rightarrow 320$: $68 - 70 = -2$ (negative).\n- $320 \\rightarrow 600$: $62 - 68 = -6$ (negative).\n\nLesion ICGA intensities $I_{L}^{\\mathrm{ICGA}}(t)$ are $0, 30, 60, 80, 95, 100, 98$ with differences:\n- $0 \\rightarrow 20$: $30 - 0 = 30$ (positive).\n- $20 \\rightarrow 40$: $60 - 30 = 30$ (positive).\n- $40 \\rightarrow 80$: $80 - 60 = 20$ (positive).\n- $80 \\rightarrow 160$: $95 - 80 = 15$ (positive).\n- $160 \\rightarrow 320$: $100 - 95 = 5$ (small positive, approaching plateau).\n- $320 \\rightarrow 600$: $98 - 100 = -2$ (negative, mild washout).\n\nLesion–background differences for ICGA:\n- $t = 20$: $30 - 25 = 5$.\n- $t = 40$: $60 - 50 = 10$.\n- $t = 80$: $80 - 65 = 15$.\n- $t = 160$: $95 - 70 = 25$.\n- $t = 320$: $100 - 68 = 32$.\n- $t = 600$: $98 - 62 = 36$.\n\nThe ICGA lesion–background difference increases early but begins to plateau by mid-to-late phases, and the lesion shows mild washout late. This is consistent with staining or slow clearance rather than frank leakage. Physiologically, indocyanine green is highly protein bound and predominantly intravascular in the retinal circulation, with deeper choroidal signal; absent high-permeability extravascular pathways in the retinal lesion, overt late-phase monotonic rise is less likely than in FFA. The pattern given (lesion approaching plateau and then slight decline) aligns with staining.\n\nOption-by-option analysis.\n\nA. Leakage on fundus fluorescein angiography, evidenced by sustained positive late-phase derivative and progressive divergence of lesion from background without plateau; the indocyanine green lesion shows staining with plateau and mild washout. This matches our computations: for FFA, $\\Delta I_{L}^{\\mathrm{FFA}}$ remains positive even in late intervals $160 \\rightarrow 320$ and $320 \\rightarrow 600$, and $\\Delta I_{LB}^{\\mathrm{FFA}}$ increases without plateau; for ICGA, the lesion approaches a plateau and slightly declines late, consistent with staining. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. Staining on fundus fluorescein angiography, evidenced by derivatives approaching zero in late phases and a stable plateau in the lesion–background difference; the indocyanine green lesion shows leakage. The FFA lesion does not plateau; its derivative remains strongly positive late and the lesion–background difference expands. The ICGA lesion does not show late monotonic increases typical of leakage; instead, it plateaus and mildly washes out. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. Pooling on fundus fluorescein angiography, evidenced by an early plateau followed by a delayed stepwise rise after $t = 320$ seconds; the indocyanine green lesion shows window defect. The FFA lesion curve rises steadily from early through late phases without a delayed step; background does not drop precipitously to unmask discrete pooling. There is no evidence of a compartment-filling “step” after $t = 320$ seconds. The ICGA lesion does not show the early high transmission typical of a window defect, and window defects are transmission phenomena on FFA rather than defining ICGA behavior here. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Retinal pigment epithelium window defect on fundus fluorescein angiography, evidenced by early high intensity proportional to background and a negative late-phase derivative with constant lesion–background offset; the indocyanine green lesion shows leakage. The FFA lesion has a growing offset relative to background that accelerates late, not a constant offset; its late derivative is positive, not negative.

The stated clearance mechanisms for fluorescein (renal) and indocyanine green (hepatic) are correct. Chronic kidney disease stage $4$ corresponds to an eGFR of $15-29$ mL/min/1.73 m$^2$, so the value of $25$ mL/min per $1.73$ m$^2$ is consistent. The pharmacokinetic equations are standard for first-order elimination. The problem is scientifically and factually sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear scenario and sufficient data to deduce the pharmacokinetic changes. The assumptions (clearance scales with eGFR, $V_d$ is constant) are explicitly stated, allowing for a quantitative estimation and a logical deduction of necessary procedural modifications.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, quantitative, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. All necessary information and assumptions are provided to derive a solution. I will now proceed with the derivation and evaluation of the options.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires analyzing the pharmacokinetics of both fluorescein and indocyanine green in the context of the patient's severe renal impairment.\n\n### Analysis of Fluorescein Pharmacokinetics\n\n1.  **Clearance ($CL$)**: The problem states that fluorescein clearance ($CL_{F}$) is predominantly renal and scales with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). We can compare the patient's clearance to that of a person with normal renal function.\n    - Normal eGFR: $eGFR_{normal} \\approx 100$ mL/min per $1.73$ m$^2$.\n    - Patient's eGFR: $eGFR_{patient} = 25$ mL/min per $1.73$ m$^2$.\n\n    The ratio of the patient's fluorescein clearance to normal clearance is:\n    $$ \\frac{CL_{F, patient}}{CL_{F, normal}} \\approx \\frac{eGFR_{patient}}{eGFR_{normal}} = \\frac{25 \\text{ mL/min per } 1.73 \\text{ m}^2}{100 \\text{ mL/min per } 1.73 \\text{ m}^2} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\n    Thus, the patient's fluorescein clearance is reduced to approximately $25\\%$ of the normal value, or a reduction by a factor of $4$.\n\n2.  **Half-Life ($t_{1/2}$)**: The half-life is inversely proportional to clearance, as given by the formula $t_{1/2} = \\dfrac{\\ln 2 \\cdot V_d}{CL}$. The problem states to assume the volume of distribution ($V_d$) remains unchanged.\n    - The ratio of the patient's fluorescein half-life to the normal half-life is:\n    $$ \\frac{t_{1/2, patient}}{t_{1/2, normal}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\ln 2 \\cdot V_d}{CL_{F, patient}}}{\\frac{\\ln 2 \\cdot V_d}{CL_{F, normal}}} = \\frac{CL_{F, normal}}{CL_{F, patient}} = 4 $$\n    Therefore, the half-life of fluorescein in the patient is expected to increase by a factor of $4$.\n\n3.  **Implications for Angiography Protocol**:\n    - **Dose**: A $4$-fold increase in half-life means the drug will be present in the systemic circulation at higher concentrations for a longer duration. This increases the total drug exposure (Area Under the Curve, AUC) and elevates the risk of adverse effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting, skin discoloration, and rare but serious anaphylactoid reactions). To mitigate this increased risk while still achieving diagnostically useful fluorescence, a reduction in the standard dose is a scientifically sound and prudent safety measure. A reduction of $25\\%$ to $50\\%$ is a reasonable clinical adjustment.\n    - **Imaging Timing**:\n        - **Early Phases** (arterial, arteriovenous, venous transit): These phases depend on the injection rate and the patient's circulatory status (e.g., cardiac output). They are not directly dependent on renal clearance. Therefore, the timing for early-phase images should remain largely unchanged.\n        - **Late Phases**: Late-phase images are crucial for detecting leakage from abnormal retinal or choroidal vessels. The quality of these images depends on the signal-to-background ratio (SBR), where the \"signal\" is the accumulated fluorescein in the leakage area and the \"background\" is the fluorescein remaining in the bloodstream. Because clearance is significantly reduced, the background plasma concentration will decrease much more slowly. At standard late-phase times (e.g., $5-10$ minutes), the background would be unusually high, obscuring the signal from leakage. To achieve an adequate SBR, one must wait longer for the background plasma concentration to fall. Therefore, delaying the late-phase images (e.g., to $20-30$ minutes or even later) is a necessary modification.\n\n### Analysis of Indocyanine Green (ICG) Pharmacokinetics\n\n- The problem states that ICG is cleared by the liver and is highly protein-bound. Its clearance pathway is independent of renal function.\n- The patient's diagnosis is chronic kidney disease, with no mention of hepatic impairment.\n- Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the pharmacokinetics of ICG are not significantly altered in this patient.\n- No modification to the ICG dosage or imaging protocol is necessary based on the provided information.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. With eGFR reduced to $25$ mL/min per $1.73$ m$^2$, fluorescein clearance drops by a factor of about $4$, so the half-life increases by about $4$-fold; consider reducing the fluorescein dose by $25$–$50$\\% and delaying late-phase images (for example, obtaining them at $20$–$30$ minutes rather than earlier), while early arterial imaging remains feasible at standard times; no indocyanine green dose change is required.**\n- **Fluorescein PK**: The prediction that clearance drops by a factor of $4$ and half-life increases by a factor of $4$ is correct based on our derivation.\n- **Fluorescein Protocol**: The proposed modifications—reducing the dose by $25-50\\%$ for safety and delaying late-phase images to improve SBR—are logical and clinically appropriate. The statement about early phase timing being feasible is also correct.\n- **ICG Protocol**: The statement that no ICG dose change is required is correct, as its clearance is hepatic.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option accurately describes the pharmacokinetic changes and proposes scientifically sound and clinically appropriate modifications.\n\n**B. Lower eGFR accelerates fluorescein elimination due to reduced renal reabsorption, so increase the fluorescein dose by $50$\\% and capture late-phase images earlier (for example, at $5$ minutes), and reduce indocyanine green dose by $50$\\% because hepatic clearance will be slower.**\n- **Fluorescein PK**: The claim that lower eGFR *accelerates* elimination is fundamentally incorrect. Glomerular filtration is the primary mechanism of elimination, so reduced filtration leads to reduced elimination.\n- **Fluorescein Protocol**: The proposals to increase the dose and capture images earlier are the opposite of the correct actions.\n- **ICG Protocol**: The claim that hepatic clearance will be slower is unsubstantiated by the problem statement.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option demonstrates multiple fundamental misunderstandings of the underlying physiology and pharmacology.\n\n**C. Fluorescein kinetics are minimally affected by eGFR because ocular compartmental distribution dominates imaging signal; therefore, keep fluorescein dose and timing unchanged; reduce indocyanine green dose by $25$\\% to avoid hepatic accumulation.**\n- **Fluorescein PK**: The claim that kinetics are \"minimally affected\" is false. A $75\\%$ reduction in clearance is a major change, not a minimal one. While ocular distribution is important, it is driven by the systemic plasma concentration profile, which is severely altered.\n- **Fluorescein Protocol**: Keeping the dose and timing unchanged would lead to poor image quality (low SBR in late phase) and increased safety risks.\n- **ICG Protocol**: Reducing the ICG dose is not justified.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option incorrectly dismisses the significant impact of renal failure on fluorescein kinetics.\n\n**D. Fluorescein is contraindicated in chronic kidney disease at eGFR $25$ mL/min per $1.73$ m$^2$; avoid fluorescein entirely and perform only indocyanine green angiography with a reduced dose.**\n- **Fluorescein Contraindication**: While severe renal impairment is a relative contraindication and necessitates a careful risk-benefit analysis, it is not an absolute contraindication. Fluorescein angiography is often performed in patients with CKD, including those on dialysis, with appropriate dose adjustments and precautions. The statement \"avoid... entirely\" is too strong and not universally applied.\n- **ICG Protocol**: Reducing the ICG dose is not justified.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option presents an overly rigid and not universally accepted clinical practice guideline and makes an incorrect recommendation for ICG.\n\n**E. To normalize fluorescein clearance, schedule imaging immediately before hemodialysis and increase fluorescein dose to overcome reduced filtration; capture all phases earlier than usual, and reduce indocyanine green dose due to reduced renal function.**\n- **Fluorescein Protocol**: Scheduling before hemodialysis is a strategy to *remove* the drug post-procedure, not to \"normalize clearance\" *during* the procedure. Increasing the dose is dangerous and illogical. Capturing phases earlier is incorrect for late-phase imaging.\n- **ICG Protocol**: The reason for reducing the ICG dose (\"due to reduced renal function\") is factually wrong, as ICG is not cleared by the kidneys.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option contains several logical and factual errors regarding dose, timing, and clearance mechanisms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4654247"}]}
