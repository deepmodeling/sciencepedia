Initial Vitreous Concentration ($C_0$)**\n\nConcentration is defined as the amount of solute per unit volume of solution. Immediately after injection (at $t=0$), the entire dose of the drug, $M$, is assumed to be uniformly distributed throughout the vitreous volume, $V$.\n\nThe initial concentration, $C_0$, is therefore given by the ratio of the total mass of the drug to the volume of distribution:\n$$C_0 = \\frac{M}{V}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n- Dose, $M = 2\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n- Vitreous volume, $V = 4\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n\n$$C_0 = \\frac{2\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{4\\,\\mathrm{mL}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$$\nTo express this to three significant figures as requested, we write:\n$$C_0 = 0.500\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$$\n\n**2. Vitreous Concentration at $t = 24\\,\\mathrm{h}$**\n\nThe problem states that drug elimination follows first-order kinetics. The differential equation for a first-order elimination process is:\n$$\\frac{dC}{dt} = -kC$$\nwhere $C$ is the concentration at time $t$ and $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. Integrating this equation from $t=0$ to $t$ gives the concentration as a function of time:\n$$C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt)$$\nThe elimination rate constant, $k$, is related to the half-life, $t_{1/2}$. By definition, the half-life is the time required for the concentration to decrease to half of its initial value. So, at $t = t_{1/2}$, $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{C_0}{2}$.\nSubstituting this into the integrated rate law:\n$$\\frac{C_0}{2} = C_0 \\exp(-kt_{1/2})$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-kt_{1/2})$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -kt_{1/2}$$\n$$-\\ln(2) = -kt_{1/2}$$\nSolving for $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\nSubstituting the given half-life, $t_{1/2} = 18\\,\\mathrm{h}$:\n$$k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{18}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\nNow we can calculate the concentration at $t = 24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ using the equation $C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt)$.\n$$C(24\\,\\mathrm{h}) = C_0 \\exp\\left(-k \\cdot 24\\,\\mathrm{h}\\right)$$\n$$C(24\\,\\mathrm{h}) = (0.5\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{18\\,\\mathrm{h}} \\cdot 24\\,\\mathrm{h}\\right)$$\nThe exponent simplifies to:\n$$-\\frac{24}{18}\\ln(2) = -\\frac{4}{3}\\ln(2) = \\ln\\left(2^{-4/3}\\right)$$\nSo, the expression becomes:\n$$C(24\\,\\mathrm{h}) = (0.5) \\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(2^{-4/3}\\right)\\right) = 0.5 \\cdot 2^{-4/3}$$\nThis result can also be obtained more directly from the definition of half-life. The number of half-lives that have passed in time $t$ is $n = \\frac{t}{t_{1/2}}$. The concentration is then $C(t) = C_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n = C_0 \\cdot 2^{-t/t_{1/2}}$. For $t=24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ and $t_{1/2}=18\\,\\mathrm{h}$, this gives:\n$$C(24\\,\\mathrm{h}) = (0.5\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}) \\cdot 2^{-24/18} = 0.5 \\cdot 2^{-4/3}\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$2^{4/3} \\approx 2.519842...$$\n$$C(24\\,\\mathrm{h}) \\approx 0.5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2.519842...} \\approx 0.198425... \\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$C(24\\,\\mathrm{h}) \\approx 0.198\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$$\n\nThe two requested values are the initial concentration, $C_0 = 0.500\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$, and the concentration at $t=24\\,\\mathrm{h}$, $C(24) = 0.198\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.500 & 0.198 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4731249"}, {"introduction": "While local therapy is crucial, systemic agents like oral valganciclovir are vital for managing CMV retinitis, particularly for preventing contralateral eye involvement and systemic disease.

Let $D+$ be the event that the patient has ocular toxoplasmosis, and $T-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe problem suggests using the odds-likelihood ratio formulation of Bayes' theorem.\nThe pre-test odds of disease are given by:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{pre} = \\frac{P(D+)}{1 - P(D+)} $$\nThe likelihood ratio of a negative test ($LR-$) is the probability of a negative test in a patient with the disease divided by the probability of a negative test in a patient without the disease:\n$$ LR- = \\frac{P(T-|D+)}{P(T-|D-)} $$\nThe probability of a negative test in a diseased patient is $(1 - Se)$. The probability of a negative test in a non-diseased patient is, by definition, the specificity, $Sp$.\n$$ LR- = \\frac{1 - Se}{Sp} $$\nThe posterior odds are the product of the pre-test odds and the likelihood ratio:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{post} = \\text{Odds}_{pre} \\times LR- $$\nFinally, the posterior probability ($P_{post}$) is converted from the posterior odds:\n$$ P_{post} = P(D+|T-) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{post}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{post}} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n- Pre-test probability, $p_0 = P(D+) = 0.70$.\n- Sensitivity, $Se = 0.55$.\n- Specificity, $Sp = 0.98$.\n\n1.  Calculate pre-test odds:\n    $$ \\text{Odds}_{pre} = \\frac{0.70}{1 - 0.70} = \\frac{0.70}{0.30} = \\frac{7}{3} \\approx 2.333 $$\n\n2.  Calculate the likelihood ratio for a negative test:\n    $$ LR- = \\frac{1 - 0.55}{0.98} = \\frac{0.45}{0.98} \\approx 0.45918 $$\n\n3.  Calculate the posterior odds:\n    $$ \\text{Odds}_{post} = \\left(\\frac{7}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{0.45}{0.98}\\right) = \\frac{3.15}{2.94} \\approx 1.0714 $$\n\n4.  Calculate the posterior probability:\n    $$ P_{post} = \\frac{1.0714}{1 + 1.0714} = \\frac{1.0714}{2.0714} \\approx 0.5172 $$\n\nThe calculated posterior probability of ocular toxoplasmosis is approximately $0.517$. We compare this to the treatment threshold, $T = 0.50$.\nSince $P_{post} \\approx 0.517 > T = 0.50$, the probability of disease remains above the clinician's threshold for initiating therapy. Therefore, despite the negative PCR result, empiric anti-toxoplasma therapy should be initiated. The low sensitivity ($55\\%$) of the test means a negative result does not strongly rule out the disease when the pre-test probability is high.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Defer all treatment and repeat the same aqueous PCR in $1$–$2$ weeks; the current negative result sufficiently lowers probability below any treatment threshold.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect based on our calculation. The posterior probability is $0.517$, which is *above*, not below, the treatment threshold of $0.50$. Furthermore, delaying treatment for $1$–$2$ weeks for a lesion that threatens the macula and optic nerve poses a high risk of permanent, severe vision loss. This action is clinically indefensible.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Initiate empiric anti-toxoplasma therapy immediately, and obtain a vitreous sample for multiplex PCR including Toxoplasma gondii, CMV, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), and Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV); order a Goldmann–Witmer coefficient (GWC) for intraocular antibody synthesis, serum Toxoplasma Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) with IgG avidity testing, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) testing with CD4 T-cell count and plasma CMV DNA quantification, and use response-to-therapy as an additional diagnostic discriminator.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with the quantitative analysis and standard of care.\n1.  **Initiate empiric therapy:** This is justified by $P_{post} > T$ and is crucial for preserving vision.\n2.  **Obtain a vitreous sample:** A vitreous biopsy (vitrectomy) has a higher diagnostic yield than aqueous paracentesis, especially in the presence of dense vitritis.\n3.  **Multiplex PCR:** Testing for *Toxoplasma* and its main mimics (CMV, HSV, VZV) is a comprehensive approach to establish a definitive diagnosis.\n4.  **GWC and Serologies:** The Goldmann-Witmer coefficient for local antibody production and supportive serum tests (IgG, IgM, avidity) provide complementary diagnostic evidence.\n5.  **Immunosuppression workup:** Testing for HIV and other causes of immunodeficiency is mandatory in cases of necrotizing retinitis, even if the patient is \"known\" to be healthy.\n6.  **Response-to-therapy:** This is a valid clinical principle used to retrospectively confirm a diagnosis.\nThis strategy is both therapeutically appropriate and diagnostically robust.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Begin high-dose systemic corticosteroids as monotherapy to rapidly quell vitritis; wait for imaging follow-up with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), which will provide definitive etiology without antimicrobial use.**\nThis is a dangerously incorrect approach. Administering corticosteroids as monotherapy in the setting of an active infection is contraindicated and can lead to a fulminant, uncontrolled proliferation of the pathogen, potentially resulting in catastrophic ocular damage. Corticosteroids are only used as an adjunct to effective antimicrobial therapy to control inflammation, typically after the antimicrobial has taken effect. Additionally, OCT is a tool for assessing retinal and vitreous structure, not for determining the infectious etiology.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Treat as CMV retinitis using intravitreal and systemic ganciclovir solely because aqueous Toxoplasma gondii PCR is negative; additional diagnostics are unnecessary given the PCR result.**\nThis represents a severe misinterpretation of the diagnostic test result. The negative *Toxoplasma* PCR is not definitive due to its low sensitivity ($Se = 0.55$). The posterior probability of toxoplasmosis remains high ($0.517$). Ignoring the classic clinical presentation (reactivation scar, dense vitritis in an immunocompetent host) and the high pre-test probability in favor of a single, non-conclusive test is poor reasoning. The clinical picture is much less typical for CMV. Declaring additional diagnostics unnecessary is also incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Perform fluorescein angiography and fundus autofluorescence only; imaging will definitively distinguish etiologies, so antimicrobial therapy can safely be delayed until imaging is completed.**\nThis option contains two critical errors. First, while ancillary imaging like fluorescein angiography (FA) and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) are useful for characterizing the lesion, they do not definitively distinguish between different causes of necrotizing retinitis (e.g., toxoplasmosis vs. herpetic retinopathies), as their features can overlap. Second, and more importantly, delaying sight-saving antimicrobial therapy for non-definitive testing is medically inappropriate. The first priority is to treat the probable infection.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4731297"}]}
