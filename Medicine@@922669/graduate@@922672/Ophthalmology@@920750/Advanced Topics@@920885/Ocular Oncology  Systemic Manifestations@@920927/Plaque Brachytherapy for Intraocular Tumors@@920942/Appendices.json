A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe first step is to derive the expression for $$r(\\theta)$$, the radial distance from the center to the edge of the elliptical tumor base. The Cartesian equation for the ellipse is given as:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{y}{b}\\right)^{2} = 1 $$\nWe convert to polar coordinates using the standard transformation: $$x = r\\cos(\\theta)$$ and $$y = r\\sin(\\theta)$$. Substituting these into the ellipse equation gives:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{r(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)}{a}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{r(\\theta)\\sin(\\theta)}{b}\\right)^{2} = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{r(\\theta)^{2}\\cos^{2}(\\theta)}{a^{2}} + \\frac{r(\\theta)^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\theta)}{b^{2}} = 1 $$\nFactoring out $$r(\\theta)^{2}$$:\n$$ r(\\theta)^{2} \\left( \\frac{\\cos^{2}(\\theta)}{a^{2}} + \\frac{\\sin^{2}(\\theta)}{b^{2}} \\right) = 1 $$\nSolving for $$r(\\theta)^{2}$$:\n$$ r(\\theta)^{2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\cos^{2}(\\theta)}{a^{2}} + \\frac{\\sin^{2}(\\theta)}{b^{2}}} $$\nTo simplify the denominator, we find a common denominator of $$a^{2}b^{2}$$:\n$$ r(\\theta)^{2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{b^{2}\\cos^{2}(\\theta) + a^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\theta)}{a^{2}b^{2}}} = \\frac{a^{2}b^{2}}{b^{2}\\cos^{2}(\\theta) + a^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\theta)} $$\nSince $$r(\\theta)$$ must be a positive distance, we take the positive square root:\n$$ r(\\theta) = \\frac{ab}{\\sqrt{b^{2}\\cos^{2}(\\theta) + a^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\theta)}} $$\nThis is the derived expression for $$r(\\theta)$$.\n\nNext, we must determine the minimum achieved margin, $$\\Delta_{\\min}$$. The margin is defined as $$\\Delta(\\theta) = r_{p} - r(\\theta)$$. The minimum margin, $$\\Delta_{\\min}$$, will occur when the radial extent of the tumor, $$r(\\theta)$$, is at its maximum, $$r_{\\max}$$.\n$$ \\Delta_{\\min} = r_{p} - r_{\\max} $$\nTo find $$r_{\\max}$$, we must find the minimum value of the denominator of the expression for $$r(\\theta)$$, which is $$\\sqrt{b^{2}\\cos^{2}(\\theta) + a^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\theta)}$$. This is equivalent to minimizing the term inside the square root, let's call it $$D(\\theta) = b^{2}\\cos^{2}(\\theta) + a^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\theta)$$.\nUsing the trigonometric identity $$\\cos^{2}(\\theta) = 1 - \\sin^{2}(\\theta)$$, we can write:\n$$ D(\\theta) = b^{2}(1 - \\sin^{2}(\\theta)) + a^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\theta) = b^{2} - b^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\theta) + a^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\theta) = b^{2} + (a^{2} - b^{2})\\sin^{2}(\\theta) $$\nWe are given $$a=5$$ and $$b=3.5$$. Since $$a > b$$, the term $$(a^{2} - b^{2})$$ is positive. Therefore, to minimize $$D(\\theta)$$, we must minimize $$\\sin^{2}(\\theta)$$. The minimum value of $$\\sin^{2}(\\theta)$$ is $$0$$, which occurs when $$\\theta = 0$$ and $$\\theta = \\pi$$.\nAt these angles, the minimum value of the denominator term is $$D_{\\min} = b^{2}$$.\nThis yields the maximum tumor radius:\n$$ r_{\\max} = \\frac{ab}{\\sqrt{D_{\\min}}} = \\frac{ab}{\\sqrt{b^{2}}} = \\frac{ab}{b} = a $$\nThis result is geometrically intuitive: the largest radial distance from the center of an ellipse is its semi-major axis, $$a$$.\nNow we can compute $$\\Delta_{\\min}$$ using the given values: $$r_{p} = 6 \\text{ mm}$$ and $$a = 5 \\text{ mm}$$.\n$$ \\Delta_{\\min} = r_{p} - a = 6 - 5 = 1 \\text{ mm} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the geometric coverage factor, $$c$$.\n$$ c = \\max\\!\\left(0, \\min\\!\\left(1, \\frac{\\Delta_{\\min}}{m}\\right)\\right) $$\nUsing $$\\Delta_{\\min} = 1 \\text{ mm}$$ and the required margin $$m = 2.0 \\text{ mm}$$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta_{\\min}}{m} = \\frac{1}{2.0} = 0.5 $$\nNow substitute this value into the expression for $$c$$:\n$$ c = \\max(0, \\min(1, 0.5)) $$\nFirst, evaluate the inner function:\n$$ \\min(1, 0.5) = 0.5 $$\nThen, evaluate the outer function:\n$$ c = \\max(0, 0.5) = 0.5 $$\nThe problem asks for the answer rounded to three significant figures, so $$c = 0.500$$.\n\nTo justify whether the plaque meets the requirement, we compare the minimum achieved margin, $$\\Delta_{\\min} = 1.0 \\text{ mm}$$, with the required margin, $$m = 2.0 \\text{ mm}$$. Since $$\\Delta_{\\min}  m$$, the chosen plaque does **not** meet the geometric margin requirement in all directions.\n\nThe potential underdosage, which corresponds to the region of insufficient margin, occurs where the margin is at its minimum. This happens when the tumor radius $$r(\\theta)$$ is at its maximum, $$r_{\\max} = a$$. This occurs at polar angles $$\\theta = 0$$ and $$\\theta = \\pi$$, which correspond to the endpoints of the major axis of the elliptical tumor. Therefore, the margin is smallest, and potential radiotherapy underdosage would occur, along the direction of the tumor's longest diameter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.500}$$", "id": "4713103"}, {"introduction": "A physical dose of radiation delivered continuously over several days, as in plaque brachytherapy, produces a different biological effect than the same total dose delivered in a few high-dose-rate fractions.

The seed that was at $x=1$ is now at $x=2$; this is the new \"nearest-to-fovea\" seed in the problem's simplified logic, $S'_n = (1+1, -1) = (2,-1)$.\n-   **New Parameters:** $A'_c = 1.06A$, $A'_n = 0.5A$, $F'_{\\text{fovea}} = 0.8$, $F'_{\\text{apex}} = 1.0$.\n-   **New Distances:**\n    $r'_{c \\to \\text{apex}} = \\sqrt{(3-2)^2 + (-1-3)^2} = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-4)^2} = \\sqrt{17}$ $\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    $r'_{n \\to \\text{fovea}} = \\sqrt{(2-0)^2 + (-1-0)^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{5}$ $\\mathrm{mm}$.\n-   **New Dose Rates:**\n    $\\dot{D}_{\\text{apex, B}} = k \\frac{1.06A \\cdot 1.0}{(\\sqrt{17})^2} = \\frac{1.06 k A}{17}$.\n    $\\dot{D}_{\\text{fovea, B}} = k \\frac{0.5A \\cdot 0.8}{(\\sqrt{5})^2} = \\frac{0.4 k A}{5} = \\frac{k A}{12.5}$.\n-   **Check Objectives:**\n    Apex Ratio: $\\frac{\\dot{D}_{\\text{apex, B}}}{\\dot{D}_{\\text{apex, base}}} = \\frac{1.06 k A / 17}{k A / 16} = \\frac{1.06 \\times 16}{17} = \\frac{16.96}{17} \\approx 0.9976$.\n    Since $0.95 \\le 0.9976 \\le 1.05$, objective 1 is met.\n    Foveal Ratio: $\\frac{\\dot{D}_{\\text{fovea, B}}}{\\dot{D}_{\\text{fovea, base}}} = \\frac{k A / 12.5}{k A / 2} = \\frac{2}{12.5} = \\frac{4}{25} = 0.16$.\n    Since $0.16 \\le 0.50$, objective 2 is met.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Shift the plaque $-1$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ nasally (toward the fovea), increase the central seed activity by $6\\%$ ($A_c = 1.06\\,A$), keep the nearest-to-fovea seed activity unchanged ($A_n = A$), and do not use anisotropic orientation ($F_{\\text{fovea}} = F_{\\text{apex}} = 1.0$).**\n-   **New Seed Locations:** Shift is $-1$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ in $x$. $S'_c = (2-1, -1) = (1,-1)$. The seed that was at $x=1$ is now at $x=0$, $S'_n = (1-1, -1) = (0,-1)$.\n-   **New Parameters:** $A'_c = 1.06A$, $A'_n = A$, $F'=1.0$.\n-   **New Distances:**\n    $r'_{c \\to \\text{apex}} = \\sqrt{(1-2)^2 + (-1-3)^2} = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + (-4)^2} = \\sqrt{17}$ $\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    $r'_{n \\to \\text{fovea}} = \\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (-1-0)^2} = \\sqrt{0^2 + (-1)^2} = 1$ $\\mathrm{mm}$.\n-   **New Dose Rates:**\n    $\\dot{D}_{\\text{apex, C}} = k \\frac{1.06A \\cdot 1.0}{(\\sqrt{17})^2} = \\frac{1.06 k A}{17}$.\n    $\\dot{D}_{\\text{fovea, C}} = k \\frac{A \\cdot 1.0}{1^2} = k A$.\n-   **Check Objectives:**\n    Apex Ratio: $\\frac{1.06 k A / 17}{k A / 16} \\approx 0.9976$. Objective 1 is met.\n    Foveal Ratio: $\\frac{k A}{k A / 2} = 2.0$.\n    Since $2.0 \\not\\le 0.50$, objective 2 is not met. Shifting the plaque toward the fovea dramatically increases its dose, which is counterproductive.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Keep the plaque centered, reduce the nearest-to-fovea seed activity to $25\\%$ ($A_n = 0.25\\,A$), increase the central seed activity by $10\\%$ ($A_c = 1.10\\,A$), and do not use anisotropic orientation ($F_{\\text{fovea}} = F_{\\text{apex}} = 1.0$).**\n-   **New Seed Locations:** Same as baseline. $S_c=(2,-1)$, $S_n=(1,-1)$.\n-   **New Parameters:** $A'_c = 1.10A$, $A'_n = 0.25A$, $F'=1.0$.\n-   **New Dose Rates:**\n    $\\dot{D}_{\\text{apex, D}} = k \\frac{1.10A \\cdot 1.0}{4^2} = \\frac{1.10 k A}{16}$.\n    $\\dot{D}_{\\text{fovea, D}} = k \\frac{0.25A \\cdot 1.0}{(\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\frac{0.25 k A}{2}$.\n-   **Check Objectives:**\n    Apex Ratio: $\\frac{1.10 k A / 16}{k A / 16} = 1.10$.\n    Since $1.10 > 1.05$, this violates the $\\pm 5\\%$ constraint of objective 1.\n    Foveal Ratio: $\\frac{0.25 k A / 2}{k A / 2} = 0.25$. This meets objective 2.\n    However, the strategy must meet both objectives.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Use a larger-diameter plaque centered over the tumor with uniform loading ($A_c = A_n = A$), thereby introducing additional seeds closer to the fovea.**\nThis is a qualitative description. A larger plaque, centered at $x=2$ $\\mathrm{mm}$, would have a wider seed distribution. Seeds would be placed at locations with $x1$ $\\mathrm{mm}$. For example, a seed might be placed at $x=0$ $\\mathrm{mm}$, directly external to the fovea. This new seed, being only $1$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ from the fovea (at $z=-1$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ vs. fovea at $z=0$), would deliver a very high dose, thus substantially increasing the total foveal dose. This is the opposite of the desired outcome.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, only option B successfully satisfies both clinical objectives.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4713107"}]}
