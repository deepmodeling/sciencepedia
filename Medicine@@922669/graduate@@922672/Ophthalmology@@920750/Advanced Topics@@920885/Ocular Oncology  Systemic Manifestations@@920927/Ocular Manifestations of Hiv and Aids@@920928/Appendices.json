The modeling of lesion expansion as a constant marginal advance is a standard and accepted simplification for untreated cases.

We model this using basic geometric principles under the given assumptions.\n\nLet $r(t)$ be the radius of the lesion at time $t$, and $A(t)$ be its area.\nThe initial radius at time $t=0$ is given as $r_0 = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nThe rate of marginal advance is the rate at which the radius increases, $\\frac{dr}{dt}$. This rate is given as a constant, $v = 750\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{week}$. To maintain consistent units with the initial radius, we convert this rate to $\\mathrm{mm}/\\mathrm{week}$.\n$$v = 750\\,\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{week}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 0.75\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mm}}{\\mathrm{week}}$$\n\nSince the rate of change of the radius is constant, the radius at any time $t$ is a linear function of time:\n$$r(t) = r_0 + v \\cdot t$$\n\nWe need to find the radius after $t = 4\\,\\mathrm{weeks}$.\n$$r(4\\,\\mathrm{weeks}) = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} + \\left(0.75\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mm}}{\\mathrm{week}}\\right) \\times (4\\,\\mathrm{weeks})$$\n$$r(4\\,\\mathrm{weeks}) = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} + 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 4.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThe area of the lesion is assumed to be circular. The area $A$ of a circle with radius $r$ is given by the formula:\n$$A = \\pi r^2$$\n\nThus, the area of the lesion at $t = 4\\,\\mathrm{weeks}$, denoted as $A(4)$, is:\n$$A(4) = \\pi [r(4\\,\\mathrm{weeks})]^2$$\nSubstituting the calculated radius:\n$$A(4) = \\pi (4.5\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2$$\n$$A(4) = \\pi (20.25\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2)$$\n\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we evaluate this expression and round to four significant figures as requested.\n$$A(4) = 20.25 \\times \\pi \\approx 63.617251235... \\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives:\n$$A(4) \\approx 63.62\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{63.62}$$", "id": "4697544"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis of CMV retinitis is suspected, clinicians must systematically integrate evidence from various sources to confirm or refute their hypothesis.

This is a classic application of Bayes' theorem for updating belief in a hypothesis given new evidence.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant events based on the problem statement:\n- Let $D$ be the event that the patient has CMV retinitis.\n- Let $\\neg D$ be the event that the patient does not have CMV retinitis.\n- Let $T_1$ be the event that the Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) test is positive.\n- Let $T_2$ be the event that the aqueous humor CMV Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay is positive.\n\nNext, we extract the probabilities and test characteristics provided in the problem:\n- The pre-test probability (prior probability) of having the disease is $P(D) = 0.25$.\n- The probability of not having the disease is the complement: $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n- For the OCT test ($T_1$):\n  - Sensitivity: $P(T_1 | D) = 0.75$. This is the probability of a positive test given the disease is present.\n  - Specificity: $P(\\neg T_1 | \\neg D) = 0.85$. This is the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent. From this, we can derive the false positive rate for OCT: $P(T_1 | \\neg D) = 1 - P(\\neg T_1 | \\neg D) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n- For the PCR test ($T_2$):\n  - Sensitivity: $P(T_2 | D) = 0.92$.\n  - Specificity: $P(\\neg T_2 | \\neg D) = 0.98$.

This critical assumption allows us to express the joint conditional probabilities as products of the individual conditional probabilities:\n- For a patient with the disease: $P(T_1 \\cap T_2 | D) = P(T_1 | D) \\times P(T_2 | D)$.\n- For a patient without the disease: $P(T_1 \\cap T_2 | \\neg D) = P(T_1 | \\neg D) \\times P(T_2 | \\neg D)$.\n\nNow, we can calculate these joint conditional probabilities using the given values:\n- $P(T_1 \\cap T_2 | D) = 0.75 \\times 0.92 = 0.69$.
