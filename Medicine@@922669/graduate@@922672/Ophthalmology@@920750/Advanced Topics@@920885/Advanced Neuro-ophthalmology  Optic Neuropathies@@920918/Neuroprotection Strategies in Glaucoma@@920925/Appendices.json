The model for pressure-dependent modulus represents a valid, albeit simplified, approach to modeling the non-linear behavior of collagenous tissues. The parameter values are within physiologically plausible ranges.

The task is specific and leads to a unique solution.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in objective, technical language, free of bias or subjective claims.\n-   **Consistency Check:** The model is self-consistent. The units are handled correctly: the product $\\alpha p$ is dimensionless as $\\alpha$ is in (mmHg)$^{-1}$ and $p$ is in mmHg. Since a ratio is calculated, the units of modulus (MPa) will cancel out, removing the need for conversion to base SI units. The extraneous parameters ($a$, $h$, $\\nu$) cancel during the ratio calculation, which is expected and does not constitute a flaw.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe central deflection of the lamina cribrosa, $w_0$, is given to be proportional to $\\dfrac{p}{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p)}$. Let $C$ be the constant of proportionality, which depends on the plate geometry and boundary conditions but is independent of pressure $p$ and material properties.\n$$w_{0}(p) = C \\dfrac{p}{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p)}$$\nWe are asked to compute the ratio of the central deflection at pressure $p_2 = 25$ mmHg to that at pressure $p_1 = 15$ mmHg.\n$$ \\frac{w_{0}(p_2)}{w_{0}(p_1)} = \\frac{C \\dfrac{p_2}{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p_2)}}{C \\dfrac{p_1}{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p_1)}} = \\frac{p_2}{p_1} \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p_1)}{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p_2)} $$\nThe effective bending rigidity is $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p) = \\dfrac{E_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p)\\,h^{3}}{12\\left(1-\\nu^{2}\\right)}$. Substituting this into the ratio expression:\n$$ \\frac{w_{0}(p_2)}{w_{0}(p_1)} = \\frac{p_2}{p_1} \\frac{\\dfrac{E_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p_1)\\,h^{3}}{12\\left(1-\\nu^{2}\\right)}}{\\dfrac{E_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p_2)\\,h^{3}}{12\\left(1-\\nu^{2}\\right)}} $$\nThe geometric and constant material property terms, $\\dfrac{h^{3}}{12\\left(1-\\nu^{2}\\right)}$, cancel out, simplifying the ratio to:\n$$ \\frac{w_{0}(p_2)}{w_{0}(p_1)} = \\frac{p_2}{p_1} \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p_1)}{E_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p_2)} $$\nThe pressure-dependent effective modulus is given by $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p) = E_{\\mathrm{LC},0}\\left(1+\\alpha\\,p\\right) + \\gamma\\,E_{\\mathrm{scl}}$. We first calculate $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p)$ for $p_1 = 15$ mmHg and $p_2 = 25$ mmHg using the provided parameters: $E_{\\mathrm{LC},0} = 1.0$ MPa, $E_{\\mathrm{scl}} = 2.5$ MPa, $\\gamma = 0.20$, and $\\alpha = 0.010$ (mmHg)$^{-1}$.\n\nFor $p_1 = 15$ mmHg:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p_1) = E_{\\mathrm{eff}}(15) = (1.0)\\left(1+(0.010)(15)\\right) + (0.20)(2.5) $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{eff}}(15) = (1.0)(1+0.15) + 0.50 $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{eff}}(15) = 1.15 + 0.50 = 1.65 \\text{ MPa} $$\n\nFor $p_2 = 25$ mmHg:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{eff}}(p_2) = E_{\\mathrm{eff}}(25) = (1.0)\\left(1+(0.010)(25)\\right) + (0.20)(2.5) $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{eff}}(25) = (1.0)(1+0.25) + 0.50 $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{eff}}(25) = 1.25 + 0.50 = 1.75 \\text{ MPa} $$\n\nNow, we substitute these values back into the simplified ratio expression:\n$$ \\frac{w_{0}(25)}{w_{0}(15)} = \\frac{25}{15} \\frac{1.65}{1.75} = \\frac{5}{3} \\frac{1.65}{1.75} $$\n$$ \\frac{w_{0}(25)}{w_{0}(15)} = \\frac{8.25}{5.25} \\approx 1.571428... $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $1.571$.\n\nFor the brief interpretation, had the material been strictly linear elastic, $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ would be constant, and the ratio of deflections would be simply the ratio of pressures: $\\dfrac{p_2}{p_1} = \\dfrac{25}{15} \\approx 1.667$. The calculated ratio of $1.571$ is less than this linear prediction. This demonstrates that the pressure-dependent stiffening (the effective modulus increases from $1.65$ MPa to $1.75$ MPa) causes the lamina cribrosa to become more rigid at higher pressures, which partially counteracts the increased load. This *decreases* the deformation sensitivity to pressure changes. For neuroprotection, this suggests that the LC possesses an intrinsic biomechanical protective mechanism. Strategies aimed at enhancing this stiffening effect (e.g., via pharmacological collagen cross-linking) could potentially increase the LC's resilience to IOP elevation, thereby reducing glaucomatous damage to retinal ganglion cell axons.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.571}$$", "id": "4694586"}, {"introduction": "A potent neuroprotective molecule is of little use if it cannot be delivered effectively to its target.
