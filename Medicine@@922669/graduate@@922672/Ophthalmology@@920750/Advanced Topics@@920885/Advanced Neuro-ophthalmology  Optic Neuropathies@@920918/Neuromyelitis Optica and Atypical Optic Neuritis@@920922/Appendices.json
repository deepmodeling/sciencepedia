A solution will now be formulated.\n\n**Solution Formulation**\n\nThe primary task is to compute the proportion of the optic nerve that shows signs of inflammatory involvement, as indicated by gadolinium enhancement on MRI. An interpretation based on this proportion is also required.\n\nLet $L_{\\text{involved}}$ represent the length of the optic nerve segment demonstrating enhancement, and let $L_{\\text{total}}$ represent the total length of the optic nerve segment under assessment.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the given values are:\n$$ L_{\\text{involved}} = 35 \\; \\text{mm} $$\n$$ L_{\\text{total}} = 45 \\; \\text{mm} $$\n\nThe proportion of involvement, denoted by $P$, is defined as the ratio of the involved length to the total length.\n$$ P = \\frac{L_{\\text{involved}}}{L_{\\text{total}}} $$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into the equation:\n$$ P = \\frac{35}{45} $$\n\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $5$.\n$$ P = \\frac{35 \\div 5}{45 \\div 5} = \\frac{7}{9} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a unitless decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures. We convert the exact fraction $\\frac{7}{9}$ to its decimal representation.\n$$ P = \\frac{7}{9} = 0.77777... $$\n\nTo round this value to four significant figures, we examine the fifth significant figure. The first four significant figures are $7$, $7$, $7$, and $7$. The fifth significant figure is also $7$. Since this is $5$ or greater, we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$ P \\approx 0.7778 $$\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for an interpretation of the severity category. The criterion provided is that \"longitudinally extensive involvement is characterized by enhancement over a majority of the optic nerve length.\" A \"majority\" corresponds to a proportion greater than one-half, or $P > 0.5$.\n\nOur calculated proportion is $P \\approx 0.7778$. We compare this value to the threshold of $0.5$.\n$$ 0.7778 > 0.5 $$\nSince the proportion of the involved optic nerve significantly exceeds $0.5$, the finding meets the criterion for longitudinally extensive involvement. This is a characteristic imaging feature often associated with NMOSD-related optic neuritis, distinguishing it from more typical optic neuritis (e.g., associated with multiple sclerosis) where lesions are often shorter. The calculated proportion of approximately $78\\%$ involvement strongly supports the classification of this presentation as longitudinally extensive optic neuritis (LEON).\n\nThe final numerical answer required is the proportion, rounded to four significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7778}$$", "id": "4694000"}, {"introduction": "The identification of Aquaporin-4 Immunoglobulin G (AQP4-IgG) is the serological hallmark of NMOSD, but interpreting a test result requires more than knowing its sensitivity and specificity.

Using only the core definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and conditional probability as embodied by Bayes’ theorem, derive the positive predictive value, defined as the posterior probability of NMOSD given a positive AQP4-IgG test result.

It is a well-posed application of Bayesian probability to a realistic clinical scenario in diagnostic medicine. All necessary data are provided, the terminology is precise, and the underlying principles are scientifically sound.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $D$: The event that the patient has Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD).\n- $D^c$: The event that the patient does not have NMOSD.\n- $T^+$: The event that the Aquaporin-4 Immunoglobulin G (AQP4-IgG) test is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the AQP4-IgG test is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1.  The pretest probability, or prior probability, of the patient having NMOSD is $P(D) = 0.20$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease, is $P(T^+ | D) = 0.80$.\n3.  The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease, is $P(T^- | D^c) = 0.98$.\n\nOur objective is to calculate the positive predictive value (PPV), which is the posterior probability of the patient having NMOSD given a positive test result. This is denoted by the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes’ theorem, the posterior probability is given by:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nTo use this formula, we must first calculate the total probability of a positive test result, $P(T^+)$. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: a true positive (the patient has the disease and tests positive) or a false positive (the patient does not have the disease and tests positive). Using the law of total probability, we can express $P(T^+)$ as:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can expand this to:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nWe have most of the values needed for this calculation, but we must first determine $P(D^c)$ and $P(T^+ | D^c)$.\n\nThe probability of not having the disease, $P(D^c)$, is the complement of having the disease:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$$\n\nThe term $P(T^+ | D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given the absence of disease, which is the false positive rate. This is the complement of the specificity, $P(T^- | D^c)$:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$$\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the expression for $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.80)(0.20) + (0.02)(0.80)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.16 + 0.016$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.176$$\n\nWe now have all the components to calculate the positive predictive value, $P(D | T^+)$, using Bayes' theorem. The numerator, $P(T^+ | D) P(D)$, is the probability of a true positive, which we already calculated as $0.16$. The denominator is the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+) = 0.176$.\n\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{0.16}{0.176}$$\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$P(D | T^+) \\approx 0.90909090...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(D | T^+) \\approx 0.9091$$\n\nThus, the positive predictive value of the AQP4-IgG test in this clinical context is approximately $0.9091$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9091}$$", "id": "4694031"}, {"introduction": "Beyond diagnosis, a central goal in managing optic neuritis is to understand and predict the functional consequences of neuronal damage.

Linear visual sensitivity, $S_L$, is proportional to the RNFL thickness, $T$. This can be expressed mathematically as $S_L = k \\cdot T$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n2.
