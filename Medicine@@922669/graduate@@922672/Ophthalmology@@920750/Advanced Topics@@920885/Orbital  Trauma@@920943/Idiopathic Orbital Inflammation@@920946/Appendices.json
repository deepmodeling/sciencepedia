It is scientifically grounded in probability theory and its application to medical diagnostics, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed in objective, formal language. There are no scientific or logical flaws. We shall proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has Idiopathic Orbital Inflammation (IOI).\nLet $D^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have IOI.\nLet $T$ be the event of a positive steroid response test.\n\nThe problem provides the following information in probabilistic terms:\nThe pre-test probability of IOI is the prior probability of the disease, $P(D) = p = 0.30$.\nThe probability of not having IOI is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\nThe sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease: $P(T|D) = s = 0.85$.\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease: $P(T^c|D^c) = t = 0.70$.\n\nWe are asked to derive an expression for the posterior probability of IOI given a positive test result, $P(D|T)$, and then compute its numerical value.\n\nThe derivation begins with the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nFrom this definition, we can write the joint probability of events $D$ and $T$ in two ways:\n$P(D \\cap T) = P(D|T)P(T)$\n$P(D \\cap T) = P(T|D)P(D)$\n\nEquating these two expressions for $P(D \\cap T)$ yields Bayes' theorem:\n$P(D|T)P(T) = P(T|D)P(D)$\nSolving for the desired posterior probability, $P(D|T)$, we get:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)}$$\n\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T)$, is the total probability of a positive test. We can expand this using the law of total probability over the partition of the sample space defined by the events $D$ and $D^c$:\n$P(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap D^c)$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability again, this can be written as:\n$P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$\n\nSubstituting this expansion for $P(T)$ into our expression for Bayes' theorem, we have:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)}$$\n\nNow, we must express all terms on the right-hand side using the given parameters $p$, $s$, and $t$.\nWe have:\n- $P(D) = p$\n- $P(D^c) = 1 - p$\n- $P(T|D) = s$\n\nThe term $P(T|D^c)$ represents the probability of a positive test given that the disease is absent. This is the false positive rate. Since specificity, $t = P(T^c|D^c)$, is the probability of a negative test in an individual without the disease, the events $T$ and $T^c$ are complementary. Thus:\n$P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - t$\n\nSubstituting these symbolic representations into the formula for $P(D|T)$ gives the final derived expression:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{s \\cdot p}{s \\cdot p + (1 - t)(1 - p)}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data: $p = 0.30$, $s = 0.85$, and $t = 0.70$.\nFirst, calculate the value of each component:\n- $p = 0.30$\n- $s = 0.85$\n- $1 - p = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$\n- $1 - t = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30$\n\nSubstitute these values into the expression:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{0.85 \\times 0.30}{(0.85 \\times 0.30) + (0.30 \\times 0.70)}$$\n\nCalculate the products:\n- Numerator: $0.85 \\times 0.30 = 0.255$\n- Denominator, first term: $0.85 \\times 0.30 = 0.255$\n- Denominator, second term: $0.30 \\times 0.70 = 0.210$\n\nSubstitute these intermediate results back into the equation:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{0.255}{0.255 + 0.210} = \\frac{0.255}{0.465}$$\n\nPerforming the final division gives the exact value:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{255}{465} = \\frac{17}{31} \\approx 0.548387096...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
