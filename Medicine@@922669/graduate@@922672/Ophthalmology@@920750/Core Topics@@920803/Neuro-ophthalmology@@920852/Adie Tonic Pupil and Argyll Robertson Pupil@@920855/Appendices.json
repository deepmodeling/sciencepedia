By definition, a constriction amplitude is the difference between the baseline diameter and the diameter under a stimulus. Let the baseline pupil diameter be $D_{0}$, the near fixation diameter be $D_{n}$, and the bright light diameter be $D_{\\ell}$. The near constriction amplitude is\n$$\nA_{n} = D_{0} - D_{n},\n$$\nand the light constriction amplitude is\n$$\nA_{\\ell} = D_{0} - D_{\\ell}.\n$$\nThe near-to-light amplitude ratio is defined as\n$$\nR = \\frac{A_{n}}{A_{\\ell}}.\n$$\n\n2. The pupillary light reflex pathway is retinal ganglion cells projecting via the optic nerve to the pretectal nuclei, bilaterally activating the Edinger–Westphal nucleus, with parasympathetic preganglionic fibers traveling in the oculomotor nerve to the ciliary ganglion, and postganglionic fibers via short ciliary nerves innervating the iris sphincter. The near response engages cortical inputs (including frontal eye fields and the supraoculomotor area), converging on the Edinger–Westphal nucleus, and similarly drives the iris sphincter, but without dependence on the pretectal relay.\n\n3. Adie’s tonic pupil classically reflects postganglionic parasympathetic dysfunction at or distal to the ciliary ganglion with aberrant reinnervation preferentially enhancing the near response, producing light–near dissociation and often a relatively large baseline pupil that constricts tonically to near.

In contrast, AR pupils are typically miotic and irregular; while they also demonstrate light–near dissociation, the absolute near amplitude is often limited by the small baseline diameter, and the light reflex may be nearly absent. The combination of a large baseline diameter with markedly greater near versus light amplitude aligns more strongly with Adie’s tonic pupil mechanisms than with Argyll Robertson pupil.\n\nTherefore, the exact near-to-light amplitude ratio is $R = 6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "4649746"}, {"introduction": "While light-near dissociation points toward certain diagnoses, confirming Adie's tonic pupil often requires pharmacologic testing.

The calculated value $\\Delta = \\frac{24}{49}$ is approximately $0.49$, which corresponds to a $49\\%$ reduction in pupillary area. This is a very significant constriction. The problem asks to relate this to the principle that \"pharmacologic supersensitivity increases the effect size of a fixed low agonist concentration.\"\n\nAdie's tonic pupil results from damage to the postganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers that innervate the iris sphincter muscle. This denervation leads to an upregulation of cholinergic receptors on the muscle cells, a phenomenon known as denervation supersensitivity. A dilute concentration of a cholinergic agonist, such as the $0.125\\%$ pilocarpine used in the test, is too weak to cause significant constriction in a normal, healthy pupil. However, in an eye with Adie's pupil, the supersensitive sphincter muscle constricts vigorously in response to this low concentration. The large calculated value of $\\Delta$ reflects a strong pharmacologic response, which is the defining characteristic of denervation supersensitivity and is therefore highly indicative of Adie's tonic pupil.\n\nIn contrast, the Argyll Robertson pupil is typically associated with neurosyphilis, and the lesion is located in the dorsal midbrain, disrupting the pupillary light reflex pathway but leaving the parasympathetic innervation to the iris (ciliary ganglion and postganglionic fibers) intact. Since there is no postganglionic denervation, there is no resulting supersensitivity of the iris sphincter. An Argyll Robertson pupil would not exhibit a significant constrictive response to dilute pilocarpine. If this test were performed on a patient with an Argyll Robertson pupil, $d_{\\text{after}}$ would be nearly equal to $d_{\\text{before}}$, and the value of $\\Delta$ would be close to $0$.\n\nThus, the substantial fractional reduction in area, $\\Delta = \\frac{24}{49}$, serves as a key diagnostic differentiator.

The data (e.g., pupil sizes, drug concentrations) are quantitative and unambiguous.\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It presents a classic neuro-ophthalmological puzzle that requires the integration of anatomical, physiological, and pharmacological knowledge for its solution.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe clinical presentation is that of a unilateral, fixed, dilated right pupil in an otherwise neurologically intact young adult. This localizes the lesion to the efferent parasympathetic pathway innervating the right iris sphincter muscle. The primary differential diagnoses for this presentation are:\n$1$. Oculomotor nerve (CN III) palsy (specifically, the superficial parasympathetic fibers).\n$2$. Adie's tonic pupil (damage to the ciliary ganglion or short ciliary nerves, i.e., postganglionic).\n$3$. Pharmacologic blockade of the iris sphincter's muscarinic receptors.\n\nThe pharmacologic testing with pilocarpine is designed to differentiate between these possibilities. Pilocarpine is a direct-acting cholinergic agonist that binds to and activates muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, causing the iris sphincter to contract and the pupil to constrict (miosis).\n\n*   **Analysis of the $0.125\\%$ Pilocarpine Test:** This is a dilute solution. In a case of postganglionic denervation (Adie's tonic pupil), the muscarinic receptors on the iris sphincter upregulate in number and sensitivity, a phenomenon known as denervation supersensitivity. Such a supersensitive pupil would constrict significantly to a dilute pilocarpine solution that has minimal effect on a normal pupil. In this case, the affected right pupil showed **no constriction**, while the normal left pupil showed mild constriction. This result is strong evidence **against** a diagnosis of Adie's tonic pupil.\n\n*   **Analysis of the $1\\%$ Pilocarpine Test:** This is a standard, full-strength miotic agent.\n    *   In a CN III palsy, the nerve signal fails to reach the neuromuscular junction, but the sphincter muscle and its receptors are intact. Therefore, a direct-acting agonist like $1\\%$ pilocarpine will bypass the nerve lesion and stimulate the receptors, causing the pupil to constrict.\n    *   In Adie's pupil, the receptors are not only intact but supersensitive, so constriction to $1\\%$ pilocarpine would be profound.\n    *   In the patient's case, the right pupil **remained fixed and dilated at $7$ mm, showing no response** to a strong, direct-acting miotic agent. The only logical explanation for this finding is that something is preventing pilocarpine from binding to and activating the muscarinic receptors on the iris sphincter muscle. This points unequivocally to a **pharmacologic blockade** by a competitive antagonist (an anticholinergic/antimuscarinic agent). Such an agent, like atropine or scopolamine (which are used in anesthesia), binds to the receptors and blocks them, preventing both endogenous acetylcholine and exogenous pilocarpine from causing constriction. The patient's occupation as an anesthesia resident provides a strong contextual clue for accidental exposure.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Pharmacologic mydriasis due to muscarinic receptor blockade of the iris sphincter; competitive antagonism prevents acetylcholine and pilocarpine from activating sphincter pupillae, eliminating light and near responses and preventing constriction even to $1\\%$ pilocarpine.**\n    This option correctly identifies the diagnosis as pharmacologic mydriasis. The proposed mechanism—muscarinic receptor blockade by a competitive antagonist—perfectly explains why the pupil is dilated and fixed (unresponsive to light and near) and, most critically, why it fails to constrict even to a full-strength ($1\\%$) solution of pilocarpine. This matches our derivation precisely.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Adie’s tonic pupil from postganglionic parasympathetic denervation at the ciliary ganglion; light–near dissociation is expected, with denervation supersensitivity causing constriction to $0.125\\%$ pilocarpine.**\n    This option is incorrect for two main reasons. First, the problem states the right pupil has no constriction with near effort, which is inconsistent with the classic light-near dissociation of Adie's pupil. Second, and more definitive, the hallmark of Adie's is denervation supersensitivity, which would cause the pupil to constrict to dilute ($0.125\\%$) pilocarpine. The patient's pupil showed no such constriction.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Argyll Robertson pupil from dorsal midbrain damage; small, irregular pupils that do not react to light but constrict to near, typically bilateral; pharmacologic testing with pilocarpine is not diagnostic.**\n    This option is incorrect. Argyll Robertson pupils are characteristically small (miotic) and bilateral, whereas the patient has a large ($7$ mm) unilateral pupil. Furthermore, Argyll Robertson pupils exhibit light-near dissociation (they constrict to near, but not light), while the patient's pupil is unreactive to both stimuli.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Oculomotor nerve (Third Cranial Nerve) palsy causing mydriasis; associated ptosis and ophthalmoplegia would be expected, and pilocarpine would typically cause constriction due to intact sphincter receptors.**\n    This option is incorrect. While a pupil-sparing CN III palsy is possible, the key refutation lies in the pilocarpine test. As the option itself correctly states, a pupil dilated due to a nerve palsy has intact receptors and would constrict with pilocarpine. The patient's pupil did not constrict, ruling out this diagnosis. The absence of ptosis and ophthalmoplegia also makes this diagnosis less likely.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Sympathomimetic mydriasis due to alpha-adrenergic agonist exposure; the near response should remain intact because the parasympathetic pathway is undisturbed, and pilocarpine would induce constriction.**\n    This option is incorrect. Sympathomimetic agents (like phenylephrine) stimulate the iris dilator muscle, but they do not paralyze the iris sphincter muscle. Therefore, the light and near responses, though potentially reduced in amplitude, would not be entirely absent. Critically, the parasympathetic pathway and sphincter receptors are unaffected, so pilocarpine would successfully constrict the pupil. The patient's pupil was completely unreactive to both near stimulus and pilocarpine.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4649749"}]}
