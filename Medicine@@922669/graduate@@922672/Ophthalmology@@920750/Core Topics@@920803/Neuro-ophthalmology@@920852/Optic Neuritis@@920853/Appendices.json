The numerical values are within a realistic range for the clinical context of optic neuritis. No flaws are identified.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the letter score $L$ and the RNFL thickness $T$.\nFrom the given proportionalities:\n1.  $N \\propto T \\implies N = c_1 T$ for some constant $c_1 > 0$.\n2.  $\\mathrm{SNR} \\propto \\sqrt{N} \\implies \\mathrm{SNR} = c_2 \\sqrt{N}$ for some constant $c_2 > 0$.\n3.  $s^{\\ast} \\propto 1/\\mathrm{SNR} \\implies s^{\\ast} = c_3 / \\mathrm{SNR}$ for some constant $c_3 > 0$.\n\nCombining these, we relate $s^{\\ast}$ to $T$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR} = c_2 \\sqrt{c_1 T} = (c_2 \\sqrt{c_1}) \\sqrt{T}\n$$\n$$\ns^{\\ast} = \\frac{c_3}{c_2 \\sqrt{c_1} \\sqrt{T}} = \\frac{c_4}{\\sqrt{T}}\n$$\nwhere $c_4 = c_3 / (c_2 \\sqrt{c_1})$ is a new positive constant.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $s^{\\ast}$ into the equation for the letter score $L$:\n$$\nL(T) = C - 50 \\log_{10}(s^{\\ast}) = C - 50 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{c_4}{\\sqrt{T}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\log_{10}(a/b) = \\log_{10}(a) - \\log_{10}(b)$ and $\\log_{10}(x^p) = p \\log_{10}(x)$:\n$$\nL(T) = C - 50 \\left( \\log_{10}(c_4) - \\log_{10}(T^{1/2}) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nL(T) = C - 50 \\log_{10}(c_4) + 50 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\log_{10}(T) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nL(T) = \\left( C - 50 \\log_{10}(c_4) \\right) + 25 \\log_{10}(T)\n$$\nLet $C' = C - 50 \\log_{10}(c_4)$ be a new constant. The relationship between letter score and RNFL thickness is:\n$$\nL(T) = C' + 25 \\log_{10}(T)\n$$\nThe letter score reduction, $R$, is defined as the difference between the baseline score $L_0 = L(T_0)$ and the post-event score $L_1 = L(T_1)$:\n$$\nR = L_0 - L_1 = (C' + 25 \\log_{10}(T_0)) - (C' + 25 \\log_{10}(T_1))\n$$\n$$\nR = 25 (\\log_{10}(T_0) - \\log_{10}(T_1)) = 25 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{T_0}{T_1}\\right)\n$$\nNext, we express $R$ as a function of the fractional change $\\delta = (T_0 - T_1)/T_0$.

To find the first-order linear approximation, $R_{\\text{lin}}(\\delta)$, we compute the Taylor series of $R(\\delta)$ around $\\delta = 0$ and keep terms up to the first order:\n$$\nR_{\\text{lin}}(\\delta) = R(0) + R'(0) \\delta\n$$\nFirst, $R(0) = -25 \\log_{10}(1 - 0) = -25 \\log_{10}(1) = 0$.\nTo find the derivative $R'(\\delta)$, we use the relationship $\\log_{10}(x) = \\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(10)}$ and the chain rule:\n$$\nR(\\delta) = -25 \\frac{\\ln(1 - \\delta)}{\\ln(10)}\n$$\n$$\nR'(\\delta) = \\frac{d}{d\\delta} \\left( -25 \\frac{\\ln(1 - \\delta)}{\\ln(10)} \\right) = \\frac{-25}{\\ln(10)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 - \\delta} \\cdot (-1) = \\frac{25}{(1 - \\delta)\\ln(10)}\n$$\nEvaluating the derivative at $\\delta = 0$:\n$$\nR'(0) = \\frac{25}{(1 - 0)\\ln(10)} = \\frac{25}{\\ln(10)}\n$$\nThus, the first-order linear approximation for the reduction is:\n$$\nR_{\\text{lin}}(\\delta) = 0 + \\left(\\frac{25}{\\ln(10)}\\right) \\delta = \\frac{25}{\\ln(10)} \\delta\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given values. The baseline thickness is $T_0 = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and the post-event thickness is $T_1 = 80\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The fractional change $\\delta$ is:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{T_0 - T_1}{T_0} = \\frac{100 - 80}{100} = \\frac{20}{100} = 0.2\n$$\nSubstituting this value into the linear approximation formula:\n$$\nR_{\\text{lin}} = \\frac{25}{\\ln(10)} \\times 0.2 = \\frac{5}{\\ln(10)}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.30258509...$:\n$$\nR_{\\text{lin}} \\approx \\frac{5}{2.30258509...} \\approx 2.1714724...\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested, we obtain:\n$$\nR_{\\text{lin}} \\approx 2.17\n$$\nThis represents an estimated loss of approximately $2.17$ letters on the low-contrast chart.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.17}\n$$", "id": "4704871"}, {"introduction": "The management of acute demyelinating optic neuritis often involves high-dose intravenous corticosteroids to hasten visual recovery.
