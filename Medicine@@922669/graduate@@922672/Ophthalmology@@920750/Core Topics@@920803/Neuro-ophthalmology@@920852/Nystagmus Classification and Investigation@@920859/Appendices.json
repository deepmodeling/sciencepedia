This is a standard and well-posed clinical reasoning task. The information provided is sufficient to distinguish between the major types of nystagmus listed in the options.\n-   **Objectivity**: The description is quantitative and objective (e.g., $2.5$ degrees, $3.5$ Hz, decelerating velocity from $18$ deg/s to $4$ deg/s). There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is free of the invalidating flaws listed in the instructions. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe task is to classify the patient's nystagmus based on the provided eye movement recordings and to identify the most appropriate confirmatory investigation. We will analyze the key features from the problem statement based on first principles of ocular motor control.\n\n1.  **Effect of Binocular Fusion**: Under binocular viewing, the nystagmus is of low amplitude ($2.5$ degrees) and frequency ($3.5$ Hz). When monocularly viewing (either eye), the nystagmus intensity markedly increases (amplitude to $5.0$ degrees, frequency to $4.0$ Hz). This demonstrates that binocular sensory fusion is damping or suppressing an underlying ocular motor instability. The disruption of fusion via occlusion reveals this instability. This is a key feature of nystagmus associated with maldevelopment of the binocular system.\n\n2.  **Nystagmus Characteristics under Monocular Viewing**: The nystagmus observed under occlusion is a jerk nystagmus, characterized by a slow drift and a corrective fast phase.\n    -   **Slow Phase Direction**: The slow phase is always a **nasalward drift** in the viewing eye. For the right eye, this is a leftward drift. For the left eye, this is a rightward drift.\n    -   **Fast Phase Direction (Beat Direction)**: The fast phase is corrective, moving the eye back toward the temporal direction. For the right eye viewing, the fast phase is \"toward the right,\" which is a rightward (temporal) beat. For the left eye viewing, the fast phase is \"toward the left,\" which is a leftward (temporal) beat. Therefore, the **nystagmus beat direction reverses** when the viewing eye is switched. This is a pathognomonic sign.\n    -   **Slow Phase Velocity Waveform**: The velocity is described as a **monotonic deceleration**, from a peak of $\\approx 18$ deg/s down to $\\approx 4$ deg/s. This is often referred to as a \"decreasing exponential\" waveform.\n\n3.  **Synthesis of Findings**: The combination of these features—(a) history of early-onset binocular vision disorder (strabismus), (b) nystagmus that is latent or minimal during binocular viewing but manifest and intense upon monocular occlusion, (c) a jerk nystagmus that reverses direction depending on the viewing eye (always beating temporally), and (d) a decreasing-velocity slow phase waveform—is the classic presentation of **Fusion Maldevelopment Nystagmus Syndrome (FMNS)**, formerly known as latent/manifest latent nystagmus.\n\n4.  **Associated Findings**: A key associated finding in FMNS, stemming from the same underlying sensorimotor deficit, is an **asymmetry in the monocular optokinetic nystagmus (OKN)**. The inherent tendency for the viewing eye to drift nasally makes it difficult for the pursuit system to track a target moving temporally (which would require a nasalward eye movement). Conversely, tracking a target moving nasally (which requires a temporalward eye movement) is relatively easy. This results in a higher OKN gain for nasally moving stimuli compared to temporally moving stimuli.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Fusion Maldevelopment Nystagmus Syndrome (FMNS). Monocular occlusion disrupts fusion and reveals a jerk nystagmus that increases in intensity with occlusion, with slow phases nasalward in the viewing eye and decelerating slow-phase velocity; confirm by demonstrating reversal of beat direction when switching the viewing eye and marked asymmetry of optokinetic gain favoring motion toward the viewing eye.**\n- **Analysis**: This option correctly identifies the syndrome as FMNS. The justification provided perfectly matches the findings derived from the problem description: increased intensity with occlusion, nasalward slow phases, and decelerating slow-phase velocity. The proposed confirmatory actions are also characteristic of FMNS. The reversal of beat direction is indeed a defining feature (though it was already described in the problem data). The marked asymmetry of optokinetic gain is the classic additional test used to confirm the diagnosis. The phrasing \"favoring motion toward the viewing eye\" is slightly ambiguous but is best interpreted in this context as referring to the known OKN asymmetry (i.e., favoring nasalward stimulus motion, which elicits temporalward eye tracking).\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Infantile Nystagmus Syndrome (INS). The increased intensity with occlusion reflects loss of foveation periods characteristic of INS; confirm by demonstrating accelerating slow-phase velocity and symmetric optokinetic gain with preserved foveation index under monocular viewing.**\n- **Analysis**: This diagnosis is incorrect. The defining slow-phase waveform for INS is **accelerating**, not decelerating as explicitly stated in the problem (velocity from $18$ deg/s to $4$ deg/s). Furthermore, INS does not typically reverse beat direction upon switching the viewing eye, and its monocular OKN responses are generally symmetric. The confirmatory tests proposed in this option (accelerating velocity, symmetric gain) are features of INS but are directly contradicted by the data given in the problem statement.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Peripheral vestibular nystagmus due to unilateral hypofunction. The nasalward drift in the viewing eye reflects an ipsilesional vestibular bias; confirm by caloric testing showing unilateral canal paresis and by Alexander’s law (increased amplitude with gaze toward the fast phase) regardless of occlusion.**\n- **Analysis**: This diagnosis is incorrect. Peripheral vestibular nystagmus has a **linear (constant velocity)** slow phase, which contradicts the described decelerating velocity. Most importantly, vestibular nystagmus has a fixed beat direction (e.g., always right-beating or left-beating) that does not reverse when the viewing eye is changed. The reversal of beat direction is a definitive sign that rules out a simple peripheral vestibular cause.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Spasmus nutans. The increase in intensity with occlusion is typical of spasmus nutans; confirm by showing high-frequency, small-amplitude pendular oscillations that resolve spontaneously and symmetric optokinetic responses under monocular viewing.**\n- **Analysis**: This diagnosis is incorrect. Spasmus nutans is characterized by **pendular** oscillations (sine-wave-like, without distinct slow/fast phases), in contrast to the **jerk** nystagmus described in the problem. Spasmus nutans is also a transient condition of infancy that typically resolves, whereas the patient's condition is presented as a persistent finding linked to a history of strabismus.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4695500"}]}
