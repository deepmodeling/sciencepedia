It is scientifically grounded in the principles of ophthalmic optics, is well-posed with a complete and consistent set of data and criteria, and is expressed objectively. A unique solution can be determined through logical derivation and systematic calculation.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution: first, the derivation of the formula for spherical equivalent ($SE$) from first principles, and second, the application of this formula and provided referral criteria to a given dataset to determine the number of children who require referral.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Spherical Equivalent Expression**\n\nA spherocylindrical lens, which models an astigmatic eye, has two principal meridians with different refractive powers. These meridians are mutually orthogonal. In the negative-cylinder convention, a refractive state is given by Sphere ($S$), Cylinder ($C$), and an axis.\n\nLet the two principal meridians be $M_1$ and $M_2$. The power along the meridian specified by the axis is simply the spherical component, $S$. Let's denote this power as $P_1$.\n$$P_1 = S$$\nThe power along the second principal meridian, $M_2$, which is located $90^\\circ$ away from the first meridian, is the sum of the spherical and cylindrical components. Let's denote this power as $P_2$.\n$$P_2 = S + C$$\nSince the problem uses the negative-cylinder convention, $C$ is always less than or equal to zero ($C \\le 0$), meaning $P_2 \\le P_1$.\n\nWhen parallel light rays pass through such a lens, they do not converge to a single point. Instead, they form two perpendicular focal lines, corresponding to the focal points of the two principal meridians. The distance between these two focal lines is known as the interval of Sturm.\n\nThe circle of least confusion (CLC) is the location along the optical axis within the interval of Sturm where the cross-section of the refracted light bundle is a circle. This point represents the best overall focus. The vergence at the circle of least confusion is defined as the spherical equivalent ($SE$). This vergence is the dioptric midpoint, or arithmetic mean, of the powers of the two principal meridians.\n\nTherefore, the spherical equivalent, $SE$, is given by:\n$$SE = \\frac{P_1 + P_2}{2}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $P_1$ and $P_2$ in terms of $S$ and $C$:\n$$SE = \\frac{S + (S + C)}{2}$$\n$$SE = \\frac{2S + C}{2}$$\n$$SE = S + \\frac{C}{2}$$\nThis is the analytic expression for the spherical equivalent in terms of sphere $S$ and cylinder $C$, derived from the fundamental principles of spherocylindrical optics.\n\n**Part 2: Application of Referral Criteria**\n\nThe uniform referral criteria are as follows, where OD denotes the right eye (oculus dexter) and OS denotes the left eye (oculus sinister):\n1.

Derivation of the Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$)**\n\nThe $NPV$ is defined as the conditional probability that a child does not have the disease given that the test result is negative, i.e., $P(D^c | T^-)$.\nFollowing the same logic as for $PPV$, we start with Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe numerator is expressed in our symbols as $Sp \\cdot (1 - P)$.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the overall probability of a negative test result. Using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D) P(D) + P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting our symbols:\n$$P(T^-) = ((1 - Se) \\cdot P) + (Sp \\cdot (1 - P))$$\nAssembling the expression for $NPV$:\n$$NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^- | D) P(D) + P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}$$\nThe final symbolic expression for $NPV$ is:\n$$NPV = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1-P)}{(1 - Se)P + Sp(1 - P)}$$\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given $P = 0.05$, $Se = 0.85$, and $Sp = 0.80$.\n\nFor $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.85)(0.05)}{(0.85)(0.05) + (1 - 0.80)(1 - 0.05)} = \\frac{0.0425}{0.0425 + (0.20)(0.95)} = \\frac{0.0425}{0.0425 + 0.19} = \\frac{0.0425}{0.2325}$$\n$$PPV \\approx 0.1827956989...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $PPV = 0.1828$.\n\nFor $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{(0.80)(1 - 0.05)}{(1 - 0.85)(0.05) + (0.80)(1 - 0.05)} = \\frac{(0.80)(0.95)}{(0.15)(0.05) + (0.80)(0.95)} = \\frac{0.76}{0.0075 + 0.76} = \\frac{0.76}{0.7675}$$\n$$NPV \\approx 0.9902279934...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $NPV = 0.9902$.\n\n**4. Interpretation of Clinical Implications**\n\nThe computed values have significant clinical implications for counseling families.\n\nA $PPV$ of $0.1828$ indicates that among children who receive a positive (fail) screening result, only about $18.3\\%$ actually have the underlying condition. The remaining $81.7\\%$ ($1 - 0.1828$) are false positives. This low $PPV$ is a common feature of screening tests applied to populations with low disease prevalence. In counseling, it is crucial to explain that a \"failed\" screening is not a diagnosis but rather an indicator of increased risk that warrants a referral for a definitive diagnostic examination by a pediatric ophthalmologist. This framing helps manage parental anxiety and underscores that the majority of children referred from screening will be found to be healthy upon full examination.\n\nAn $NPV$ of $0.9902$ is very high. This means that among children who receive a negative (pass) screening result, over $99\\%$ are truly free of the condition. The probability of having the condition despite a negative test (a false negative) is very low, at $1 - NPV \\approx 0.0098$, or less than $1\\%$. This high $NPV$ provides strong reassurance. When a child passes the screening, the family can be confidently informed that it is extremely unlikely their child has the targeted amblyopia risk factors. The test is highly effective at ruling out the condition.\n\nIn summary, the screener is an effective tool for identifying a population of children for further diagnostic workup while being highly reliable in reassuring the families of children who screen negative. The principal challenge highlighted by the low $PPV$ lies in communicating the meaning of a positive result to prevent undue alarm.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0.1828 & 0.9902 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4709891"}]}
