Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem is to derive the horizontal retinal disparity for a target viewed by a healthy observer. We will follow the instructions to derive the expression from first principles and then compute its value.\n\nLet's establish a 2D Cartesian coordinate system $(x, z)$. The eyes are located on the $x$-axis, and the objects are on the $z$-axis.\n-   Position of the left eye ($E_L$): $(x_L, z_L) = \\left(-\\frac{b}{2}, 0\\right)$\n-   Position of the right eye ($E_R$): $(x_R, z_R) = \\left(+\\frac{b}{2}, 0\\right)$\n-   Position of the fixation point ($F$): $(x_F, z_F) = \\left(0, Z_f\\right)$\n-   Position of the target ($T$): $(x_T, z_T) = \\left(0, Z_t\\right)$\n\nThe line of sight from an eye to an object forms an angle with the z-axis (the straight-ahead direction). For a point $(x_p, z_p)$ viewed from an eye at $(x_e, 0)$, the angle $\\theta$ of the line of sight relative to the z-axis is given by $\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{x_p - x_e}{z_p - 0}$. Thus, $\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{x_p - x_e}{z_p}\\right)$.\n\nThe foveal line of sight for each eye is directed at the fixation point $F$.\nFor the left eye, the angle of the foveal line of sight is:\n$$ \\theta_{L,f} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{x_F - x_L}{Z_f}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{0 - (-\\frac{b}{2})}{Z_f}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{2Z_f}\\right) $$\nFor the right eye, the angle of the foveal line of sight is:\n$$ \\theta_{R,f} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{x_F - x_R}{Z_f}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{0 - (+\\frac{b}{2})}{Z_f}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(-\\frac{b}{2Z_f}\\right) $$\n\nThe line of sight for each eye to the target $T$ is also defined by its angle.\nFor the left eye, the angle to the target is:\n$$ \\theta_{L,t} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{x_T - x_L}{Z_t}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{0 - (-\\frac{b}{2})}{Z_t}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{2Z_t}\\right) $$\nFor the right eye, the angle to the target is:\n$$ \\theta_{R,t} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{x_T - x_R}{Z_t}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{0 - (+\\frac{b}{2})}{Z_t}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(-\\frac{b}{2Z_t}\\right) $$\n\nThe horizontal angular deviation of the target from the fovea is the difference between the angle to the target and the angle to the fixation point.\nFor the left eye, this deviation is:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta_L = \\theta_{L,t} - \\theta_{L,f} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{2Z_t}\\right) - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{2Z_f}\\right) $$\nFor the right eye, this deviation is:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta_R = \\theta_{R,t} - \\theta_{R,f} = \\arctan\\left(-\\frac{b}{2Z_t}\\right) - \\arctan\\left(-\\frac{b}{2Z_f}\\right) $$\n\nHorizontal retinal disparity, $\\delta$, is defined as the difference between the left eye's deviation and the right eye's deviation: $\\delta = \\Delta\\theta_L - \\Delta\\theta_R$.\n$$ \\delta = \\left[ \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{2Z_t}\\right) - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{2Z_f}\\right) \\right] - \\left[ \\arctan\\left(-\\frac{b}{2Z_t}\\right) - \\arctan\\left(-\\frac{b}{2Z_f}\\right) \\right] $$\nUsing the property that $\\arctan(-x) = -\\arctan(x)$:\n$$ \\delta = \\left[ \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{2Z_t}\\right) - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{2Z_f}\\right) \\right] - \\left[ -\\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{2Z_t}\\right) + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{2Z_f}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\delta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{2Z_t}\\right) - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{2Z_f}\\right) + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{2Z_t}\\right) - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{2Z_f}\\right) $$\nThis simplifies to the exact expression for disparity based on the arctangent function:\n$$ \\delta = 2 \\left( \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{2Z_t}\\right) - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{b}{2Z_f}\\right) \\right) $$\nThis is the derived expression from first principles.\n\nNext, we apply the small-angle approximation as instructed. For a small angle $\\alpha$ (in radians), $\\arctan(\\alpha) \\approx \\alpha$. The arguments of the arctangent functions are small for typical viewing distances.\nThus, the expression for disparity becomes:\n$$ \\delta \\approx 2 \\left( \\frac{b}{2Z_t} - \\frac{b}{2Z_f} \\right) $$\n$$ \\delta \\approx b \\left( \\frac{1}{Z_t} - \\frac{1}{Z_f} \\right) $$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value.

Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the relationship between a small depth separation, $\\Delta Z$, and the corresponding difference in binocular disparity, $\\Delta \\delta$, for targets near a fixation distance $Z$. Subsequently, this relationship is to be used to compute $\\Delta Z$ for the given parameters.\n\nFirst, we establish the geometric model based on first principles. We model the two eyes as pinhole cameras separated by the interpupillary distance, which serves as the baseline $b$. Let's set up a coordinate system where the origin $(0,0)$ is at the midpoint of the baseline. The left eye's nodal point is at $L = (-b/2, 0)$ and the right eye's nodal point is at $R = (b/2, 0)$. The subject fixates a point $P_f$ on the midline, so its coordinates are $P_f = (0, Z)$.\n\nConsider a general point target $P$ also on the midline at a distance $z$ from the baseline, with coordinates $(0, z)$. The lines of sight from the left and right eyes to this point form angles with the midline (the z-axis). Let $\\phi_L$ and $\\phi_R$ be the angles that the lines of sight $LP$ and $RP$ make with a line parallel to the z-axis originating from each eye.\n\nFrom the geometry:\n$$\n\\tan(\\phi_L) = \\frac{x_P - x_L}{z_P - z_L} = \\frac{0 - (-b/2)}{z - 0} = \\frac{b}{2z}\n$$\n$$\n\\tan(\\phi_R) = \\frac{x_P - x_R}{z_P - z_R} = \\frac{0 - (b/2)}{z - 0} = -\\frac{b}{2z}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that we can use small-angle approximations. For a small angle $\\theta$ in radians, $\\tan(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$. This approximation is valid because the fixation distance $Z$ is much larger than the baseline $b$. Applying this approximation:\n$$\n\\phi_L \\approx \\frac{b}{2z}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_R \\approx -\\frac{b}{2z}\n$$\n\nThe horizontal disparity of a point is defined relative to the state of convergence of the eyes. For symmetric fixation on the midline, the binocular disparity $\\delta$ of the point $P$ at depth $z$ relative to the fixation point $P_f$ at depth $Z$ is the difference in the vergence angles required to foveate each point. The vergence angle for a point at depth $z$ is the total angle subtended by the baseline at that point, which is $\\gamma(z) = \\phi_L - \\phi_R$.\n$$\n\\gamma(z) \\approx \\frac{b}{2z} - \\left(-\\frac{b}{2z}\\right) = \\frac{b}{z}\n$$\nThe disparity $\\delta(z)$ of the point at depth $z$ relative to the fixation at $Z$ is:\n$$\n\\delta(z) = \\gamma(z) - \\gamma(Z) \\approx \\frac{b}{z} - \\frac{b}{Z}\n$$\n\nTo find the relationship between a small change in depth, $\\Delta Z$, and the resulting small change in disparity, $\\Delta \\delta$, we use a first-order linearization of the function $\\delta(z)$ around the fixation distance $z=Z$.

The variance of the fused estimate is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{fused}^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sigma_d^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_t^2} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{\\sigma_d^2 \\sigma_t^2}{\\sigma_d^2 + \\sigma_t^2}\n$$\nThe uncertainty (standard deviation) is the square root of the variance:\n$$\n\\sigma_{fused} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_d^2 \\sigma_t^2}{\\sigma_d^2 + \\sigma_t^2}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $Z_d=120\\,\\text{mm}$, $Z_t=90\\,\\text{mm}$, $\\sigma_d=10\\,\\text{mm}$, and $\\sigma_t=25\\,\\text{mm}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the fused estimate $\\hat{Z}_{fused}$:\nThe precisions are $1/\\sigma_d^2 = 1/10^2 = 1/100 = 0.01$ and $1/\\sigma_t^2 = 1/25^2 = 1/625 = 0.0016$.\n$$\n\\hat{Z}_{fused} = \\frac{Z_d \\cdot (1/\\sigma_d^2) + Z_t \\cdot (1/\\sigma_t^2)}{1/\\sigma_d^2 + 1/\\sigma_t^2} = \\frac{120 \\cdot (0.01) + 90 \\cdot (0.0016)}{0.01 + 0.0016}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{Z}_{fused} = \\frac{1.2 + 0.144}{0.0116} = \\frac{1.344}{0.0116} \\approx 115.8620689... \\,\\text{mm}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the uncertainty $\\sigma_{fused}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{fused}^2} = \\frac{1}{10^2} + \\frac{1}{25^2} = 0.01 + 0.0016 = 0.0116\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{fused}^2 = \\frac{1}{0.0116} \\approx 86.2068965... \\,\\text{mm}^2\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{fused} = \\sqrt{86.2068965...} \\approx 9.2847669... \\,\\text{mm}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the answers to four significant figures.\nThe fused estimate is $\\hat{Z}_{fused} \\approx 115.9\\,\\text{mm}$.\nThe uncertainty is $\\sigma_{fused} \\approx 9.285\\,\\text{mm}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n115.9 & 9.285\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4657488"}]}
