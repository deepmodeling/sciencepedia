It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient, consistent data for a rigorous analysis.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by first classifying the type of intermittent exotropia and then evaluating the patient's\ncompensatory mechanisms to predict symptom burden.\n\n1.  **Classification of Exotropia Subtype:**\n    The standard classification of horizontal strabismus subtypes is based on the difference between the deviation angle measured at distance and near fixation. The provided data are:\n    -   Distance exotropia: $\\Delta_{distance} = 10\\,\\Delta$\n    -   Near exotropia: $\\Delta_{near} = 25\\,\\Delta$\n\n    The primary subtypes are:\n    -   **Divergence Excess:** The distance exodeviation is significantly greater than the near exodeviation. A common clinical criterion is $\\Delta_{distance} - \\Delta_{near} \\ge 10\\,\\Delta$.\n    -   **Basic Exotropia:** The distance and near exodeviations are approximately equal. A common criterion is $|\\Delta_{distance} - \\Delta_{near}|  10\\,\\Delta$.\n    -   **Convergence Insufficiency:** The near exodeviation is significantly greater than the distance exodeviation. A common clinical criterion is $\\Delta_{near} - \\Delta_{distance} \\ge 10\\,\\Delta$.\n\n    In this case, the difference is $\\Delta_{near} - \\Delta_{distance} = 25\\,\\Delta - 10\\,\\Delta = 15\\,\\Delta$. Since this difference is $\\ge 10\\,\\Delta$, the patient's condition is classified as **Convergence Insufficiency (CI) intermittent exotropia**.\n\n2.  **Assessment of Compensatory Mechanisms and Symptom Burden:**\n    The patient's ability to maintain single binocular vision depends on their fusional convergence ability relative to the size of the exodeviation. The key parameters are the near point of convergence (NPC) and the positive fusional vergence (PFV).\n\n    -   **Near Point of Convergence (NPC):** The NPC is given as 12 cm. A normal NPC is typically less than 8 cm. An NPC of 12 cm is considered receded or remote, indicating a primary deficiency in convergence ability.\n\n    -   **Positive Fusional Vergence (PFV):** The PFV measures the fusional reserve available to overcome the exodeviation. At near, the demand on the vergence system is equal to the near deviation, which is $25\\,\\Delta$. The patient's measured PFV (break point) at near is 10 prism diopters, or $10\\,\\Delta$.\n\n    -   **Evaluation with Sheard's Criterion:** For comfortable binocular vision, Sheard's criterion states that the fusional reserve should be at least twice the demand (phoria/intermittent tropia).\n        -   Demand = $\\Delta_{near} = 25\\,\\Delta$.\n        -   Required Reserve (PFV) $\\ge 2 \\times 25\\,\\Delta = 50\\,\\Delta$.\n        -   Actual Reserve (PFV) = $10\\,\\Delta$.\n        The patient's reserve ($10\\,\\Delta$) is far below the required $50\\,\\Delta$. In fact, the reserve is less than the deviation itself ($10\\,\\Delta  25\\,\\Delta$), indicating that the patient is unable to fully compensate for the exotropia at near, even for brief periods. This represents a severely decompensated state.\n\n    -   **Symptom Prediction:** The combination of a large near exodeviation, a receded NPC, and grossly inadequate positive fusional reserves leads to a predictable clinical picture. During sustained near tasks (e.g., reading), the vergence system will be unable to maintain alignment. This will result in eyestrain (asthenopia), headaches, and intermittent double vision (diplopia) at near. The symptom burden is therefore expected to be high.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n**A. Convergence insufficiency intermittent exotropia, with high near symptom burden (asthenopia and intermittent near diplopia), particularly during sustained near work due to inadequate compensatory convergence.**\n- **Classification:** \"Convergence insufficiency intermittent exotropia\" is correct, as established by $\\Delta_{near} > \\Delta_{distance}$.\n- **Symptom Prediction:** \"high near symptom burden ... due to inadequate compensatory convergence\" is correct, as established by the analysis of NPC, PFV, and Sheard's criterion. The specific symptoms are characteristic of this condition.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Basic intermittent exotropia, with mild and roughly equal symptoms at distance and near because compensatory vergence is adequate.**\n- **Classification:** \"Basic intermittent exotropia\" is incorrect. The near and distance deviations are significantly different ($25\\,\\Delta$ vs. $10\\,\\Delta$).\n- **Symptom Prediction:** The prediction of \"mild\" symptoms and \"adequate\" vergence is incorrect. The compensatory vergence is severely inadequate at near.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Divergence excess intermittent exotropia, with predominant distance symptoms and minimal near complaints.**\n- **Classification:** \"Divergence excess intermittent exotropia\" is incorrect. Divergence excess requires $\\Delta_{distance} > \\Delta_{near}$, which is the opposite of the given data.\n- **Symptom Prediction:** The prediction of \"predominant distance symptoms\" is incorrect. The patient's primary challenge is at near.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Decompensated exophoria at near only (no tropia), with low symptom burden because compensatory vergence meets comfort criteria.**\n- **Diagnosis:** The problem describes an \"intermittent outward ocular deviation,\" which is by definition an intermittent tropia, not just a phoria. Thus, the \"no tropia\" claim is false.\n- **Symptom Prediction:** The prediction of \"low symptom burden\" and that \"compensatory vergence meets comfort criteria\" is patently false. The PFV of $10\\,\\Delta$ is grossly insufficient for a $25\\,\\Delta$ demand.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Convergence spasm, with near esotropia and miosis consistent with accommodative spasm, producing high near symptom burden but not explained by fusional convergence deficiency.**\n- **Diagnosis:** \"Convergence spasm, with near esotropia\" is incorrect. The patient has an *exotropia* (outward deviation), not an esotropia (inward deviation). Convergence spasm is a condition of excessive convergence.\n- **Explanation:** The \"not explained by fusional convergence deficiency\" clause is also incorrect; the patient's condition is a textbook example of being caused by fusional convergence deficiency.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4672797"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the different variants of exotropia, such as the convergence insufficiency type, requires a grasp of the underlying physiological mechanisms.

All necessary parameters are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe task is to calculate the resultant near deviation of a patient with exotropia after the introduction of spherical plus lenses.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe solution will be derived from the foundational principles provided in the problem statement.\n\nLet $C$ represent the surgical correction in units of prism diopters ($\\Delta$).\nLet $d$ represent the amount of muscle recession in millimeters ($\\text{mm}$).\nLet $k$ represent the dose-response constant, which is the correction in prism diopters per millimeter of recession ($\\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{mm}}$).\n\nThe first principle states a linear dose-response relationship for a single muscle. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$C_i = k \\cdot d_i$$\nwhere the subscript $i$ denotes a specific muscle.\n\nThe second principle states that for a surgery involving multiple muscles, the total correction, $C_{total}$, is the linear sum of the individual corrections:\n$$C_{total} = \\sum_i C_i$$\n\nThe problem describes a bilateral surgery, meaning two muscles are operated on: the left lateral rectus and the right lateral rectus. Let's denote them as muscle $1$ and muscle $2$. The total correction is therefore:\n$$C_{total} = C_1 + C_2$$\n\nThe surgery consists of equal recessions on both muscles. Let this recession amount be $d$. So, $d_1 = d_2 = d$. The dose-response constant $k$ is the same for both lateral rectus muscles. The expression for the total correction becomes:\n$$C_{total} = (k \\cdot d_1) + (k \\cdot d_2) = k \\cdot d + k \\cdot d = 2kd$$\nThis is the general expression for the total expected correction produced by operating on two muscles with equal recessions $d$ and the same dose-response constant $k$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for this specific case. The given values are:\n- Dose-response constant, $k = 2.5\\ \\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{mm}}$.\n- Recession amount for each muscle, $d = 7\\ \\text{mm}$.\n- Number of muscles, $N=2$.\n\nUsing the derived expression:\n$$C_{total} = 2 \\cdot \\left(2.5\\ \\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{mm}}\\right) \\cdot (7\\ \\text{mm})$$\nFirst, calculate the product of the numerical values:\n$$2 \\times 2.5 \\times 7 = 5 \\times 7 = 35$$\nThe units cancel as follows: $\\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{mm}} \\times \\text{mm} = \\Delta$.\nSo, the total expected correction is:\n$$C_{total} = 35\\ \\Delta$$\n\nAlternatively, one can calculate the correction for a single muscle first:\n$$C_{single} = k \\cdot d = 2.5\\ \\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{mm}} \\times 7\\ \\text{mm} = 17.5\\ \\Delta$$\nApplying the principle of linear additivity for the bilateral procedure:\n$$C_{total} = C_{left} + C_{right} = 17.5\\ \\Delta + 17.5\\ \\Delta = 35\\ \\Delta$$\n\nFinally, the problem asks to compare this expected correction to the preoperative deviation to assess the adequacy of the surgical plan.\n- Preoperative exotropia, $X_{preop} = 35\\ \\Delta$.\n- Expected surgical correction, $C_{total} = 35\\ \\Delta$.\n\nThe expected correction $C_{total}$ is exactly equal to the magnitude of the preoperative deviation $X_{preop}$.
