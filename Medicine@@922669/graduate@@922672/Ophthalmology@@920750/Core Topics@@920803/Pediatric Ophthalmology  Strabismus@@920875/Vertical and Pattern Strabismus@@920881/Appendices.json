In primary position, cover testing reveals a right hypertropia of $6$ prism diopters. Assume the deviation pattern is due to an isolated right superior oblique underaction, and that the fellow eye has negligible cyclotorsion.\n\nUse the following foundational facts and approximations:\n- By definition of the prism diopter and the small-angle approximation, a deviation of $1$ prism diopter corresponds to an angular misalignment of approximately $0.01$ radians, so a vertical deviation of $D$ prism diopters corresponds to an angular vertical misalignment of approximately $0.01 D$ radians.\n- In isolated unilateral superior oblique underaction in primary position, the torsional-to-vertical small-angle coupling ratio is empirically well established to be approximately $r = 1.3$ when both components are expressed in radians. That is, the torsional misalignment magnitude $T$ and the vertical misalignment magnitude $V$ satisfy $T \\approx r V$.\n\nAssuming the double Maddox rod test reports the interocular subjective cyclodeviation in degrees and that the fellow eye has negligible torsion, compute the expected subjective torsion reading in degrees attributable to the affected eye in primary position.
