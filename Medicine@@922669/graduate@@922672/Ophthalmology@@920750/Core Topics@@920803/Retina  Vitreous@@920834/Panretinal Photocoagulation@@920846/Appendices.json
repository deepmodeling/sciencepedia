It contains no logical contradictions, missing information, or unrealistic assumptions. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**, and a solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires a derivation starting from the fundamental definition of power. Power, which we may denote as a function of time $P(t')$, is defined as the time rate of energy transfer, $E(t')$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$P(t') = \\frac{dE(t')}{dt'}$$\nTo find the total energy, $\\Delta E$, transferred over a finite time interval from $t'_1$ to $t'_2$, we must integrate the power function over this interval:\n$$\\Delta E = \\int_{t'_1}^{t'_2} P(t') dt'$$\nThe problem specifies a \"square pulse\" of duration $t$. This implies that the power is constant during the pulse and zero otherwise. The console-measured power is given as a constant value $P$. Let the pulse start at time $t' = 0$ and end at time $t' = t$. The power delivered by the laser system at the corneal plane, $P_{\\text{console}}$, is thus:\n$$P_{\\text{console}}(t') = \\begin{cases} P & \\text{for } 0 \\le t' \\le t \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\nThe energy delivered at the corneal plane, $E_{\\text{console}}$, is the integral of this power over the pulse duration:\n$$E_{\\text{console}} = \\int_{0}^{t} P dt'$$\nSince $P$ is a constant, it can be taken out of the integral:\n$$E_{\\text{console}} = P \\int_{0}^{t} dt' = P [t']_{0}^{t} = P(t - 0) = P \\cdot t$$\nThis is the energy incident on the eye. However, we are interested in the energy delivered to the retina. The ocular media (cornea, lens, vitreous humor) absorb and scatter some of this energy. The transmission fraction, $T$, quantifies the portion of energy that successfully reaches the retina. It is the ratio of the power reaching the retina, $P_{\\text{retina}}$, to the power at the cornea, $P_{\\text{console}}$.\n$$T = \\frac{P_{\\text{retina}}}{P_{\\text{console}}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{retina}}}{P}$$\nTherefore, the power arriving at the retina is also a constant value during the pulse, given by:\n$$P_{\\text{retina}} = T \\cdot P$$\nThe energy delivered to the retina, $E_{\\text{retina}}$, is found by integrating this retinal power over the pulse duration $t$:\n$$E_{\\text{retina}} = \\int_{0}^{t} P_{\\text{retina}} dt' = \\int_{0}^{t} (T \\cdot P) dt'$$\nSince $T$ and $P$ are both constants, they can be factored out of the integral:\n$$E_{\\text{retina}} = T \\cdot P \\int_{0}^{t} dt' = T \\cdot P \\cdot [t']_{0}^{t}$$\nThis evaluates to the derived expression for the energy per pulse delivered to the retina:\n$$E_{\\text{retina}} = T \\cdot P \\cdot t$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided parameters.

Therefore, a full solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by calculating the fluence, which is defined as the energy delivered per unit area.\n\nFirst, the total energy, $E$, delivered in a single laser pulse is calculated.

Equalizing $F_{\\mathrm{del}}$ is not the target; equalizing $F_{\\mathrm{abs}}$ is. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. Reducing spot size while keeping $P$ and $t$ constant increases delivered fluence because $F_{\\mathrm{del}} = \\dfrac{P\\,t}{A}$ and $A$ decreases; consequently $F_{\\mathrm{abs}} = \\alpha\\,F_{\\mathrm{del}}$ increases. In darker quadrants with higher $\\alpha$, this worsens overtreatment risk rather than mitigating it. Verdict — Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4707610"}]}
