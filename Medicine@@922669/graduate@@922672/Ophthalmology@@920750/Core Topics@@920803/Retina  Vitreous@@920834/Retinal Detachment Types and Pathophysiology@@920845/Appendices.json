Assume the SRF has density $\\rho_{\\text{SRF}} \\approx \\rho_{\\text{vit}} \\approx 1000\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$ (approximately that of water), the gravitational acceleration is $g \\approx 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$, and the vertical separation between the superior break and the macula is $\\Delta h \\approx 0.01\\,\\mathrm{m}$.

The pathophysiology of RRD, the role of SRF, the effect of gravity, and the values provided ($\\rho_{\\text{SRF}}$, $g$, $\\Delta h$) are all scientifically sound and realistic. The clinical observation that superior detachments tend to progress more rapidly toward the macula than inferior ones is a well-known fact in ophthalmology.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for justifications based on a clearly defined physical model (hydrostatics and buoyancy) applied to a specific, simplified scenario. The givens are sufficient to evaluate the options based on these principles.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no identifiable flaws. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Principle-Based Derivation\nThe problem asks to explain the differential progression rate of superior versus inferior retinal detachments using principles of hydrostatics and buoyancy. The patient is assumed to be upright, meaning the gravitational vector points downwards.\n\n1.  **Buoyancy Analysis**: The buoyant force on a parcel of fluid is determined by the density of the surrounding fluid. The problem states that the density of the subretinal fluid (SRF), which is liquefied vitreous, is approximately equal to the density of the vitreous humor it came from: $\\rho_{\\text{SRF}} \\approx \\rho_{\\text{vit}}$. The net buoyant force on a parcel of SRF of volume $V$ within the vitreous humor is $F_{net} = (\\rho_{\\text{vit}} - \\rho_{\\text{SRF}})Vg$. Since $\\rho_{\\text{SRF}} \\approx \\rho_{\\text{vit}}$, this net force is approximately zero. This means that SRF is not intrinsically \"buoyant\" or \"heavy\" relative to the vitreous.\n\n2.  **Hydrostatic Analysis**: Although the net buoyant force is negligible, gravity still acts on the SRF itself. Once SRF enters the subretinal space, it forms a continuous body of fluid. Any fluid in a gravitational field will exhibit a hydrostatic pressure gradient and will flow to minimize its gravitational potential energy.\n    -   The gravitational potential energy of a fluid mass $m$ at a height $h$ is $U = mgh$. Fluid flows spontaneously from a region of higher potential energy to a region of lower potential energy, i.e., from a higher elevation to a lower elevation.\n    -   This is equivalent to stating that fluid flows down a pressure gradient. The hydrostatic pressure difference between two points in a fluid separated by a vertical distance $\\Delta h$ is given by $\\Delta p = \\rho g \\Delta h$.\n\n3.  **Application to the Eye (Upright Patient)**:\n    -   **Superior Break**: A break located superiorly is at a higher gravitational potential than the macula and the posterior pole. SRF that enters the subretinal space through this break can flow \"downhill\" under the influence of gravity, spreading inferiorly and covering the macula. This is a gravitationally favorable path.\n    -   **Inferior Break**: A break located inferiorly is at a lower gravitational potential than the macula. For SRF from this break to reach the macula, it would have to move \"uphill\" against the force of gravity. This is a gravitationally unfavorable path. The spread of SRF would be contained inferiorly by gravity, spreading much more slowly, if at all, towards the macula.\n\nTherefore, the differential progression rate is a direct consequence of gravity acting on the SRF in the subretinal space.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. When $\\rho_{\\text{SRF}} \\approx \\rho_{\\text{vit}}$, the net buoyant force on SRF is approximately zero, so gravity manifests predominantly as a hydrostatic pressure gradient along the eye; in an upright patient, this gradient drives SRF emerging from a superior break to descend toward the posterior pole, accelerating macular involvement compared with an inferior break.**\n-   **Analysis**: This statement correctly identifies that with $\\rho_{\\text{SRF}} \\approx \\rho_{\\text{vit}}$, a simple buoyancy argument (fluid rising or sinking within the vitreous) is not relevant. It correctly transitions to the dominant effect of gravity being the creation of a hydrostatic pressure gradient within the column of SRF itself. It accurately concludes that this gradient drives fluid from a superior break downwards (a gravitationally favorable path) towards the macula, explaining the faster progression. The reasoning is entirely consistent with our derivation.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Because SRF is significantly less dense than vitreous, buoyancy causes it to rise toward superior retina, making inferior retinal detachments progress faster than superior detachaments.**\n-   **Analysis**: This statement makes two false claims. First, it asserts that SRF is \"significantly less dense than vitreous,\" which directly contradicts the given information $\\rho_{\\text{SRF}} \\approx \\rho_{\\text{vit}}$. Second, it concludes that inferior detachments progress faster, which is the opposite of the established clinical phenomenon the problem is based on.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The hydrostatic head difference between a superior break located $\\Delta h$ above the macula and the macula is $\\Delta p = \\rho_{\\text{SRF}} g \\Delta h \\approx 98\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ for $\\rho_{\\text{SRF}} \\approx 1000\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$, $g \\approx 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$, and $\\Delta h \\approx 0.01\\,\\mathrm{m}$; this establishes a gravitationally favorable flow path for SRF toward the posterior pole, so macular involvement occurs sooner from superior breaks than from inferior breaks that would require SRF to move upward against this gradient.**\n-   **Analysis**: This statement provides a quantitative calculation of the hydrostatic pressure head. Let's verify the calculation: $\\Delta p = (1000\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (9.81\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}) \\times (0.01\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 98.1\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$. The value $\\approx 98\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ is correct. This pressure difference drives the flow. The statement correctly interprets this physical fact as creating a \"gravitationally favorable flow path\" for superior breaks and an unfavorable path for inferior breaks, thus correctly explaining the differential progression. This is a correct, quantitative application of the principles.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Changing posture to sustained supine positioning rotates the gravitational vector relative to the retinal curvature; under this orientation, SRF from inferior breaks can gain a more direct, gravity-assisted path toward the posterior pole, potentially reversing the progression speed—demonstrating that orientation mediates progression via hydrostatic effects.**\n-   **Analysis**: This statement presents a logical test of the hypothesis that gravity is the primary mediating factor. In the supine (lying on back) position, the posterior pole (including the macula) becomes the gravitationally lowest point of the retina. Therefore, gravity will pull SRF from *any* peripheral break towards the macula. This would allow an inferior detachment to progress towards the macula. The argument that this postural dependence demonstrates the role of hydrostatic effects is sound scientific reasoning. This is a crucial concept in the clinical management of retinal detachments (e.g., therapeutic positioning).\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**E. The faster progression of superior detachments is explained primarily by higher vitreous traction on the superior retina during saccades; hydrostatic and buoyancy effects are negligible and do not contribute meaningfully to differential progression.**\n-   **Analysis**: This statement proposes an alternative mechanism (vitreoretinal traction) and dismisses the hydrostatic effects that the question explicitly asks to be used for the justification. It also violates the problem's simplifying assumption that \"vitreoretinal traction at baseline is assumed symmetric\". While dynamic forces during eye movements (saccades) do play a role in reality, this option fails to answer the question as posed, which is to provide a justification *using* hydrostatic and buoyancy arguments. By claiming these effects are negligible, it directly contradicts the premise of the question.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "4721236"}, {"introduction": "Having understood how gravity influences the spread of subretinal fluid, we now explore how clinicians can harness buoyancy—a related principle—for treatment.

Terms like \"central projection\" are clearly defined for the purpose of the problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem can be simplified by considering a 2D cross-section containing the center of the globe $O$, the center of the bubble $C$, and the retinal break. This is justified by the axial symmetry of the setup with respect to the gravitational axis.\n\nLet the center of the globe $O$ be the origin $(0,0)$ of a Cartesian coordinate system. The inner globe is a circle of radius $R$ given by $x^2 + y^2 = R^2$. Let the superior pole be at $(0, R)$, so the gravitational axis is the y-axis.\n\nThe gas bubble of radius $r$ is tangent to the globe at the superior pole. Its center $C$ must lie on the y-axis. The distance from the origin $O$ to the center of the bubble $C$ is given as $|OC| = R - r$. Thus, the coordinates of $C$ are $(0, R-r)$.\n\nThe retinal break is a point on the inner surface of the globe at a polar angle $\\phi$ from the superior pole. In our coordinate system, the angle from the positive y-axis is $\\phi$. A point $P$ on the circular cross-section of the retina at this angle has coordinates $(R\\sin(\\phi), R\\cos(\\phi))$.\n\nThe condition for coverage is that the ray from the center $O$ to the point $P$ must intersect the bubble. The bubble is a solid sphere (a disk in our 2D cross-section). The boundary case, which defines the minimum required bubble size, occurs when the ray $OP$ is tangent to the surface of the bubble.\n\nLet's analyze the geometry of this tangency. Consider the triangle formed by the globe's center $O$, the bubble's center $C$, and the point of tangency $T$ on the bubble's surface. The line segment $CT$ is a radius of the bubble and is perpendicular to the tangent line $OT$. Therefore, the triangle $\\triangle OCT$ is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at $T$.\n\nThe lengths of the sides of $\\triangle OCT$ are:\n- Hypotenuse $OC$: The distance from the globe's center to the bubble's center, $|OC| = R - r$.\n- Side $CT$: The radius of the bubble, $|CT| = r$.\n\nThe angle $\\angle COT$ represents the maximum polar angle from the superior axis that is covered by the bubble. Let's call this angle $\\theta_{\\text{max}}$. From the right-angled triangle $\\triangle OCT$, we have the trigonometric relationship:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta_{\\text{max}}) = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{|CT|}{|OC|} = \\frac{r}{R-r} $$\n\nFor the bubble to cover the retinal break at polar angle $\\phi$, the angle $\\phi$ must be less than or equal to the maximum angle of coverage, i.e., $\\phi \\le \\theta_{\\text{max}}$. The minimum bubble radius required to cover the break at angle $\\phi$ is the radius for which $\\theta_{\\text{max}}$ is exactly equal to $\\phi$. Let this minimum radius be $r_{\\min}$ (substituting $r = r_{\\min}$).\n\nSetting $\\theta_{\\text{max}} = \\phi$, we get the equation:\n$$ \\sin(\\phi) = \\frac{r_{\\min}}{R - r_{\\min}} $$\n\nWe now solve this equation for $r_{\\min}$.\n$$ (R - r_{\\min}) \\sin(\\phi) = r_{\\min} $$\n$$ R \\sin(\\phi) - r_{\\min} \\sin(\\phi) = r_{\\min} $$\nMove all terms involving $r_{\\min}$ to one side:\n$$ R \\sin(\\phi) = r_{\\min} + r_{\\min} \\sin(\\phi) $$\nFactor out $r_{\\min}$:\n$$ R \\sin(\\phi) = r_{\\min} (1 + \\sin(\\phi)) $$\nFinally, isolate $r_{\\min}$ by dividing by $(1 + \\sin(\\phi))$. Since $\\phi \\in (0, \\pi/2)$, $\\sin(\\phi) > 0$, so $1 + \\sin(\\phi) \\neq 0$.\n$$ r_{\\min} = \\frac{R \\sin(\\phi)}{1 + \\sin(\\phi)} $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the minimum required bubble radius in terms of the globe's radius $R$ and the break's polar angle $\\phi$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{R \\sin(\\phi)}{1 + \\sin(\\phi)}}\n$$", "id": "4721303"}, {"introduction": "We now shift our focus to a different pathophysiological mechanism: tractional retinal detachment (TRD), where the retina is pulled off by fibrovascular membranes rather than pushed off by fluid through a break.

The Green's function for the operator $L = T \\nabla^2 - k$ satisfies:\n$$T \\nabla^2 G(\\mathbf{x}) - k G(\\mathbf{x}) = -\\delta(\\mathbf{x})$$\nDividing by $T$ and defining $\\kappa^2 = k/T$, we get the standard form of the modified Helmholtz equation in two dimensions:\n$$\\nabla^2 G(\\mathbf{x}) - \\kappa^2 G(\\mathbf{x}) = -\\frac{1}{T} \\delta(\\mathbf{x})$$\nThe fundamental solution to this equation that decays at infinity is given in terms of the modified Bessel function of the second kind, order zero ($K_0$):\n$$G(\\mathbf{x}) = G(r) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi T} K_0(\\kappa r)$$\nwhere $r = |\\mathbf{x}|$ is the radial distance from the source. The parameter $\\kappa = \\sqrt{k/T}$ has units of inverse length and defines the characteristic screening length $1/\\kappa$ of the system.\n\n**2. Displacement Field by Superposition**\nThe displacement field $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x})$ is a vector with components $(u_x(\\mathbf{x}), u_y(\\mathbf{x}))$. Since the governing equation is identical for each component, we can use the Green's function for each. For a single point traction $n$ at $\\mathbf{x}_n$ with force $P_n$ and direction $\\mathbf{e}_n = (e_{n,x}, e_{n,y})$, the displacement field is:\n$$\\mathbf{u}^{(n)}(\\mathbf{x}) = P_n G(|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}_n|) \\mathbf{e}_n$$\nBy the principle of linear superposition, the total displacement field due to $N$ tractions is the sum:\n$$\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{n=1}^N \\mathbf{u}^{(n)}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{n=1}^N P_n G(|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}_n|) \\mathbf{e}_n = \\frac{1}{2\\pi T} \\sum_{n=1}^N P_n K_0(\\kappa |\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{x}_n|) \\mathbf{e}_n$$\n\n**3. Strain Tensor Calculation**\nThe strain tensor requires the gradient of the displacement field, $\\nabla \\mathbf{u}$. We can compute this by taking the gradient of each term in the sum. Let $\\mathbf{r}_n = \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}_n$ and $r_n = |\\mathbf{r}_n|$.\nThe gradient of the scalar Green's function is:\n$$\\nabla G(r_n) = \\frac{dG}{dr_n} \\nabla r_n = \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\pi T} \\frac{d}{dr_n} K_0(\\kappa r_n)\\right) \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_n}{r_n}$$\nUsing the identity $K_0'(z) = -K_1(z)$, we have:\n$$\\nabla G(r_n) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi T} (-\\kappa K_1(\\kappa r_n)) \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_n}{r_n} = -\\frac{\\kappa}{2\\pi T} K_1(\\kappa r_n) \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_n$$\nThe gradient of the displacement vector field contributed by traction $n$ is the tensor product of $\\nabla G$ and the constant vector $P_n \\mathbf{e}_n$:\n$$\\nabla \\mathbf{u}^{(n)}(\\mathbf{x}) = P_n (\\nabla G(r_n)) \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_n = -\\frac{P_n \\kappa}{2\\pi T} K_1(\\kappa r_n) (\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_n \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_n)$$\nThe total gradient is the sum over all tractions:\n$$\\nabla \\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}) = -\\frac{\\kappa}{2\\pi T} \\sum_{n=1}^N P_n K_1(\\kappa r_n) (\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_n \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_n)$$\nThe strain tensor is the symmetric part of this gradient:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^\\top) = -\\frac{\\kappa}{4\\pi T} \\sum_{n=1}^N P_n K_1(\\kappa r_n) (\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_n \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_n + \\mathbf{e}_n \\otimes \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_n)$$\nWe need to evaluate this at the macula, $\\mathbf{x}_m = \\mathbf{0}$. At this point, $\\mathbf{r}_n = \\mathbf{0} - \\mathbf{x}_n = -\\mathbf{x}_n$, so $r_n = |\\mathbf{x}_n|$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_n = -\\mathbf{x}_n / |\\mathbf{x}_n|$. Substituting this simplifies the expression:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbf{0}) = \\frac{\\kappa}{4\\pi T} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\frac{P_n}{|\\mathbf{x}_n|} K_1(\\kappa |\\mathbf{x}_n|) (\\mathbf{x}_n \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_n + \\mathbf{e}_n \\otimes \\mathbf{x}_n)$$\nLet $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ be represented by the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_{xx}  \\varepsilon_{xy} \\\\ \\varepsilon_{yx}  \\varepsilon_{yy} \\end{pmatrix}$. With $\\mathbf{x}_n = (x_n, y_n)$ and $\\mathbf{e}_n = (e_{n,x}, e_{n,y})$, the components are:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\frac{\\kappa}{4\\pi T} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\frac{P_n K_1(\\kappa |\\mathbf{x}_n|)}{|\\mathbf{x}_n|} (2 x_n e_{n,x}) \\\\\n\\varepsilon_{yy} = \\frac{\\kappa}{4\\pi T} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\frac{P_n K_1(\\kappa |\\mathbf{x}_n|)}{|\\mathbf{x}_n|} (2 y_n e_{n,y}) \\\\\n\\varepsilon_{xy} = \\varepsilon_{yx} = \\frac{\\kappa}{4\\pi T} \\sum_{n=1}^N \\frac{P_n K_1(\\kappa |\\mathbf{x}_n|)}{|\\mathbf{x}_n|} (x_n e_{n,y} + y_n e_{n,x})\n$$\n\n**4. Maximum Principal Strain**\nThe principal strains are the eigenvalues of the $2 \\times 2$ strain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$. For a symmetric matrix, the eigenvalues $\\lambda_{1,2}$ are real and are given by:\n$$\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy}}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_{xx} - \\varepsilon_{yy}}{2}\\right)^2 + \\varepsilon_{xy}^2}$$\nThe macular distortion metric is the maximum principal strain, $\\varepsilon_{\\max} = \\max(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$, which corresponds to the 'plus' sign in the formula:\n$$\\varepsilon_{\\max} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\varepsilon_{yy}}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_{xx} - \\varepsilon_{yy}}{2}\\right)^2 + \\varepsilon_{xy}^2}$$\n\n**Algorithm**\nThe implementation will follow these derived formulas. For each test case:\n1.  Read the parameters $T$, $k$, and the list of tractions.\n2.  Calculate the constant $\\kappa = \\sqrt{k/T}$.\n3.  Initialize the strain tensor components $\\varepsilon_{xx}, \\varepsilon_{yy}, \\varepsilon_{xy}$ to $0$.\n4.  Iterate through each traction $(P_n, \\mathbf{x}_n, \\mathbf{e}_n)$ in the list.\n5.  For each traction, calculate its contribution to each component of the strain tensor using the formulas above. The value of $K_1(\\kappa |\\mathbf{x}_n|)$ will be computed using a scientific library function (`scipy.special.k1`).\n6.  Add these contributions to the total $\\varepsilon_{xx}, \\varepsilon_{yy}, \\varepsilon_{xy}$.\n7.  After iterating through all tractions, use the final tensor components to calculate $\\varepsilon_{\\max}$ using the eigenvalue formula.\n8.  Round the final result to $6$ decimal places and store it.\n9.  After processing all test cases, format the list of results into the specified output string.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import k1\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the maximum principal strain (macular distortion) at the origin\n    for a set of biomechanical test cases of tractional retinal detachment.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \"T\": 0.3, \"k\": 0.09, \"tractions\": [\n                {\"P\": 0.8, \"x_vec\": (1.5, 0.0), \"e_vec\": (-1.0, 0.0)},\n                {\"P\": 0.6, \"x_vec\": (-1.2, 1.0), \"e_vec\": (0.995037, -0.0995037)},\n                {\"P\": 0.7, \"x_vec\": (0.0, -2.0), \"e_vec\": (0.0, 1.0)}\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"T\": 0.3, \"k\": 0.09, \"tractions\": [\n                {\"P\": 1.0, \"x_vec\": (10.0, 0.0), \"e_vec\": (-1.0, 0.0)}\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"T\": 0.3, \"k\": 0.09, \"tractions\": [\n                {\"P\": 0.5, \"x_vec\": (0.25, 0.25), \"e_vec\": (-0.70710678, -0.70710678)},\n                {\"P\": 0.4, \"x_vec\": (-0.4, -0.2), \"e_vec\": (0.89442719, 0.4472136)}\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"T\": 0.3, \"k\": 0.09, \"tractions\": [\n                {\"P\": 0.5, \"x_vec\": (1.0, 0.0), \"e_vec\": (-1.0, 0.0)},\n                {\"P\": 0.5, \"x_vec\": (-1.0, 0.0), \"e_vec\": (1.0, 0.0)}\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            \"T\": 0.3, \"k\": 0.9, \"tractions\": [\n                {\"P\": 0.8, \"x_vec\": (1.5, 0.0), \"e_vec\": (-1.0, 0.0)},\n                {\"P\": 0.6, \"x_vec\": (-1.2, 1.0), \"e_vec\": (0.995037, -0.0995037)},\n                {\"P\": 0.7, \"x_vec\": (0.0, -2.0), \"e_vec\": (0.0, 1.0)}\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        T = case[\"T\"]\n        k = case[\"k\"]\n        tractions = case[\"tractions\"]\n\n        kappa = np.sqrt(k / T)\n        \n        eps_xx, eps_yy, eps_xy = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0\n\n        for traction in tractions:\n            P_n = traction[\"P\"]\n            x_n_vec = np.array(traction[\"x_vec\"])\n            e_n_vec = np.array(traction[\"e_vec\"])\n            \n            x_n, y_n = x_n_vec\n            e_nx, e_ny = e_n_vec\n\n            r_n = np.linalg.norm(x_n_vec)\n            \n            # If a traction is at the origin, its contribution is singular.\n            # The problem context implies tractions are not at the evaluation point.\n            if r_n == 0:\n                continue\n\n            k1_val = k1(kappa * r_n)\n            \n            # Common scalar coefficient for this traction's contribution to strain\n            common_coeff = (kappa / (4 * np.pi * T)) * (P_n / r_n) * k1_val\n\n            # Add this traction's contribution to the total strain components\n            eps_xx += common_coeff * (2 * x_n * e_nx)\n            eps_yy += common_coeff * (2 * y_n * e_ny)\n            eps_xy += common_coeff * (x_n * e_ny + y_n * e_nx)\n        \n        # Calculate the maximum principal strain (largest eigenvalue)\n        # lambda = ( (eps_xx + eps_yy)/2 ) +/- sqrt( ( (eps_xx - eps_yy)/2 )**2 + eps_xy**2 )\n        term1 = (eps_xx + eps_yy) / 2\n        term2 = np.sqrt(((eps_xx - eps_yy) / 2)**2 + eps_xy**2)\n        \n        max_principal_strain = term1 + term2\n        results.append(max_principal_strain)\n\n    # Format output as a comma-separated list in brackets, with 6 decimal places.\n    print(f\"[{','.join([f'{r:.6f}' for r in results])}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "4721275"}]}
