Validation and Verdict**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is based on fundamental principles of statistical mechanics and fluid dynamics, specifically the theory of Brownian motion and Stokes' law. The application to protein diffusion in the eye is a well-established area of biophysical research. The provided data for hydrodynamic radii are consistent with empirical values found in the literature for these types of proteins. The modeling of vitreous as a Newtonian fluid is a standard and valid simplification in this context. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed.

A unique solution can be determined.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem statement is objective and technical, free of ambiguity or subjective language.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Scaling Relationship\n\nThe problem requires deriving the relationship between the diffusion coefficient $D$ and the hydrodynamic radius $r$ from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.\n\nThe fluctuation-dissipation theorem connects the random fluctuations of a system in thermal equilibrium (e.g., the erratic movement of a particle due to thermal bombardment from fluid molecules) to the dissipative response of the system to an external perturbation (e.g., the frictional drag experienced by the particle when pulled through the fluid).\n\nFor a particle undergoing Brownian motion, this connection is formalized by the Einstein relation for the translational diffusion coefficient $D$:\n$$\nD = \\frac{k_B T}{\\zeta}\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\zeta$ is the frictional drag coefficient. The numerator, $k_B T$, represents the characteristic thermal energy scale driving the fluctuations. The denominator, $\\zeta$, quantifies the dissipation through friction.\n\nThe problem specifies that the particle is a rigid sphere of radius $r$ moving through a continuum Newtonian fluid of dynamic viscosity $\\eta$. The hydrodynamic drag force, $F_{\\mathrm{drag}}$, on such a sphere moving at a low, constant velocity $v$ is given by Stokes' law:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{drag}} = 6 \\pi \\eta r v\n$$\nThe frictional drag coefficient, $\\zeta$, is defined as the ratio of the drag force to the velocity:\n$$\n\\zeta = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{drag}}}{v} = \\frac{6 \\pi \\eta r v}{v} = 6 \\pi \\eta r\n$$\nThis expression for $\\zeta$ describes the dissipative aspect of the particle-fluid interaction.\n\nSubstituting this expression for the frictional coefficient into the Einstein relation yields the Stokes-Einstein equation:\n$$\nD = \\frac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta r}\n$$\nThis equation provides the diffusion coefficient for a spherical particle. To find how $D$ scales with $r$, we can group the constant terms. For a given fluid (constant $\\eta$) at a constant temperature $T$, the terms $k_B$, $T$, $6$, $\\pi$, and $\\eta$ are all constant. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\nD = C \\cdot \\frac{1}{r}\n$$\nwhere $C = \\frac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta}$ is a constant. This shows that the translational diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the hydrodynamic radius:\n$$\nD \\propto \\frac{1}{r}\n$$\nThis is the required scaling relationship.\n\n### Step 3: Comparison of Diffusivities and Calculation\n\nWe are asked to compare the diffusivities of a Fab fragment, $D_{\\mathrm{Fab}}$, and an IgG antibody, $D_{\\mathrm{IgG}}$, in the same vitreous environment (same $\\eta$) and at the same temperature ($T$).\n\nUsing the derived Stokes-Einstein equation for each molecule:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{Fab}} = \\frac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta r_{\\mathrm{Fab}}}\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{IgG}} = \\frac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta r_{\\mathrm{IgG}}}\n$$\nTo find the ratio $D_{\\mathrm{Fab}}/D_{\\mathrm{IgG}}$, we divide the first equation by the second:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{Fab}}}{D_{\\mathrm{IgG}}} = \\frac{\\frac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta r_{\\mathrm{Fab}}}}{\\frac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta r_{\\mathrm{IgG}}}}\n$$\nThe common factor $\\frac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta}$ cancels out, leaving:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{Fab}}}{D_{\\mathrm{IgG}}} = \\frac{1/r_{\\mathrm{Fab}}}{1/r_{\\mathrm{IgG}}} = \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{IgG}}}{r_{\\mathrm{Fab}}}\n$$\nThe ratio of the diffusion coefficients is equal to the inverse ratio of their hydrodynamic radii.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $r_{\\mathrm{Fab}} = 3.4\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $r_{\\mathrm{IgG}} = 5.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n$$\n\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{Fab}}}{D_{\\mathrm{IgG}}} = \\frac{5.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{3.4\\,\\mathrm{nm}}\n$$\nThe units of nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}$) cancel, resulting in a dimensionless ratio.\n$$\n\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{Fab}}}{D_{\\mathrm{IgG}}} = \\frac{5.5}{3.4} \\approx 1.61764705...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{Fab}}}{D_{\\mathrm{IgG}}} \\approx 1.618\n$$\nThus, the smaller Fab fragment is expected to diffuse approximately $1.618$ times faster than the larger full-length IgG antibody under the same conditions.

Family history and prior pressure measurements suggest a moderately elevated Intraocular Pressure (IOP) risk with corticosteroid exposure; suppose this is summarized by a glaucoma risk score $G = 0.6$ on a $0$ to $1$ scale (higher is worse).\n\nUsing fundamental pathophysiology and widely accepted clinical facts, construct a decision logic that selects between either switching the anti-VEGF agent or adding intravitreal corticosteroids. The fundamental base to rely on is:\n\n- VEGF-mediated vascular permeability and exudation predominantly drive subretinal fluid, and stronger or pathway-broader VEGF suppression reduces $V_{\\mathrm{SRF}}$.\n- Inflammatory cytokines (for example, IL-$6$ and MCP-$1$) contribute to endothelial dysfunction and capillary leakage that manifests as intraretinal fluid; corticosteroids reduce inflammatory-mediated leakage, thus preferentially reducing $V_{\\mathrm{IRF}}$.\n- Dual-pathway inhibition of VEGF and ANGPT$2$ can be advantageous when ANGPT$2$ is elevated, as ANGPT$2$ destabilizes endothelial junctions and amplifies VEGF effects.\n- Safety constraints such as IOP elevation risk with corticosteroids must be incorporated into the decision.\n\nAssume the clinical objective is to maximize expected visual function by preferentially reducing the compartment that most impairs photoreceptors, while not incurring disproportionate safety risk. Let $w_{\\mathrm{IRF}}$ and $w_{\\mathrm{SRF}}$ be conceptual weights for how much reduction in $V_{\\mathrm{IRF}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{SRF}}$ respectively contribute to visual improvement, with $w_{\\mathrm{IRF}} > w_{\\mathrm{SRF}}$ in diabetic macular edema.
