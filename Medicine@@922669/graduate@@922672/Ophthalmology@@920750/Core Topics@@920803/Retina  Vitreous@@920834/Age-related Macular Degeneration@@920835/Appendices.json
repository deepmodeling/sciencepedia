This practice allows you to apply the widely used Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) simplified scoring system, a fundamental tool for clinical decision-making and patient counseling. By converting clinical findings into a quantitative risk estimate, you will hone the essential skill of prognosticating disease course based on funduscopic examination [@problem_id:4650558].", "problem": "A patient is seen with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in both eyes. On dilated fundus examination of each eye, there are large drusen with diameter $\\geq 125 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ and definite pigmentary abnormalities in the macula. There are no signs of advanced age-related macular degeneration (geographic atrophy involving the foveal center or neovascular AMD) in either eye.\n\nUse the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) simplified severity scale, defined as follows: for each eye, assign $1$ point for the presence of large drusen and $1$ point for the presence of definite pigmentary abnormalities; if advanced age-related macular degeneration is present in an eye, that eye contributes $2$ points. The total AREDS simplified score is the sum across both eyes and ranges from $0$ to $4$.\n\nAssume the following risk model for $5$-year progression to advanced age-related macular degeneration: when the total AREDS simplified score is $s=0$, the baseline $5$-year absolute risk is $p_0=0.005$. For each one-point increase in the total score, the $5$-year odds of progression are multiplied by a constant factor $\\theta=4$.\n\nBased on these assumptions and the examination findings, compute the patient’s total AREDS simplified score $s$ and then compute the corresponding absolute $5$-year risk of progression. Round your answer to $4$ significant figures. Express the final risk as a decimal fraction with no percent sign.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary information to compute a unique solution.\n\nThe solution process consists of two main steps: first, determining the patient's total AREDS simplified score based on the provided clinical findings, and second, using the given risk model to calculate the $5$-year absolute risk of progression to advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\n\n**Step 1: Calculation of the Total AREDS Simplified Score ($s$)**\n\nThe AREDS simplified severity scale is defined by assigning points to each eye based on specific findings. The total score, $s$, is the sum of points from both eyes.\n\nFor the right eye:\n- The presence of large drusen with a diameter $\\geq 125 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ contributes $1$ point.\n- The presence of definite pigmentary abnormalities contributes $1$ point.\n- The problem explicitly states there are no signs of advanced AMD, so the rule for advanced AMD (which would assign $2$ points) does not apply.\nThe score for the right eye is therefore $1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nFor the left eye:\n- The problem states that the findings are present in \"both eyes\", so the condition of the left eye is identical to the right eye.\n- The presence of large drusen contributes $1$ point.\n- The presence of definite pigmentary abnormalities contributes $1$ point.\n- There are no signs of advanced AMD.\nThe score for the left eye is also $1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nThe total AREDS simplified score, $s$, is the sum of the scores from both eyes:\n$$s = (\\text{score for right eye}) + (\\text{score for left eye}) = 2 + 2 = 4$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculation of the 5-Year Absolute Risk of Progression**\n\nThe problem provides a risk model based on odds. The relationship between probability, $p$, and odds, $O$, is given by:\n$$O = \\frac{p}{1-p} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p = \\frac{O}{1+O}$$\n\nFirst, we determine the baseline odds of progression, $O_0$, corresponding to a total score of $s=0$. The baseline $5$-year absolute risk is given as $p_0 = 0.005$.\n$$O_0 = \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} = \\frac{0.005}{1-0.005} = \\frac{0.005}{0.995}$$\n\nThe model states that for each one-point increase in the total score, the $5$-year odds of progression are multiplied by a constant factor $\\theta = 4$. This implies an exponential relationship between the odds and the score:\n$$O_s = O_0 \\cdot \\theta^s$$\nwhere $O_s$ is the odds of progression for a patient with a total score of $s$.\n\nFor this patient, the total score is $s=4$. We can now calculate the corresponding odds of progression, $O_4$:\n$$O_4 = O_0 \\cdot \\theta^4 = \\left( \\frac{0.005}{0.995} \\right) \\cdot 4^4$$\nSince $4^4 = 256$, we have:\n$$O_4 = \\frac{0.005 \\times 256}{0.995} = \\frac{1.28}{0.995}$$\n\nNow, we convert these odds back to a probability (absolute risk), $p_4$:\n$$p_4 = \\frac{O_4}{1+O_4} = \\frac{\\frac{1.28}{0.995}}{1 + \\frac{1.28}{0.995}}$$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $0.995$:\n$$p_4 = \\frac{1.28}{0.995 + 1.28} = \\frac{1.28}{2.275}$$\n\nPerforming the final division:\n$$p_4 \\approx 0.56263736...$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to $4$ significant figures.\nThe first four significant figures are $5$, $6$, $2$, and $6$. The fifth significant figure is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the fourth digit).\n$$p_4 \\approx 0.5626$$\nThis is the patient's absolute $5$-year risk of progression to advanced AMD.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5626}\n$$", "id": "4650558"}, {"introduction": "Effective management of neovascular AMD requires quantitatively monitoring the response to therapies like anti-VEGF injections.
