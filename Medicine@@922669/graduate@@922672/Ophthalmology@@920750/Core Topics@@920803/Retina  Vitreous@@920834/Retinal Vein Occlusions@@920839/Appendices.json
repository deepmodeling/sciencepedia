It provides all necessary information: the relationship between the initial and final radii, and the constancy of length and viscosity. The objective is clearly defined as finding the ratio of resistances, which eliminates the need for the absolute values of $L$ and $\\eta$. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or infeasibility.

The problem provides a single pooled within-trial standard deviation of change, $s_i$, for each trial. The square of this, $s_i^2$, is the pooled variance, which is our best estimate for the population variance of the change scores in both arms of trial $i$.
