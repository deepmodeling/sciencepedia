The clinical findings are standard ophthalmologic measurements, and the values provided are plausible. A horizontal corneal diameter of $13.5 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$ in a $6$-month-old is significantly enlarged (normal is typically $12 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$). However, the other findings—normal IOP ($12\\text{–}13 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}$), normal axial length ($20.5 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$), clear corneas without Haab striae, normal ONH ($0.3$ C/D ratio), and lack of symptoms—are inconsistent with a diagnosis of active PCG. This constellation of findings does not represent a contradiction but rather defines a specific, recognized clinical entity distinct from PCG. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a differential diagnosis. It does not violate any scientific principles and is not ambiguous.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived based on the provided information and principles.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires a diagnosis and surveillance plan based on a set of clinical findings in a $6$-month-old infant, using the provided principles.\n\n1.  **Application of Principle (i) and (ii): Definition of PCG and Laplace's Law.**\n    Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is fundamentally a disease of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) due to abnormal development of the aqueous outflow pathway (trabeculodysgenesis). According to the biomechanical principle related to Laplace's law (wall stress is proportional to pressure and radius), this elevated IOP in a malleable infant eye leads to ocular distension (buphthalmos). This distension manifests as:\n    - Increased corneal diameter.\n    - Pathologic axial elongation.\n    - Damage to the optic nerve head (cupping) from pressure and stretching.\n    - Corneal edema and breaks in Descemet's membrane (Haab striae) due to pressure-induced endothelial dysfunction and mechanical stress.\n    - Clinical symptoms such as photophobia, tearing (epiphora), and blepharospasm.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Patient Findings against PCG Criteria.**\n    - **Corneal Diameter:** The patient's corneal diameter of $13.5 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$ is enlarged and is, in isolation, a sign consistent with buphthalmos.\n    - **Intraocular Pressure (IOP):** The IOP is $12\\text{–}13 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}$, which is within the normal range for an infant. This directly contradicts the primary pathogenic mechanism of PCG, which is elevated IOP.\n    - **Axial Length:** The axial length is $20.5 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$, stated to be normal for this age. This argues against generalized ocular distension (buphthalmos).\n    - **Corneal and ONH Status:** The corneas are clear without edema or Haab striae, and the ONH cup-to-disc ratio is $0.3$ and symmetric. These findings indicate an absence of the typical structural damage caused by elevated IOP.\n    - **Symptoms:** The absence of photophobia, tearing, and blepharospasm further argues against active PCG.\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Differential Diagnosis.**\n    The clinical picture is one of isolated corneal enlargement without the requisite associated findings of elevated IOP or its sequelae. This assemblage of signs and symptoms rules out active PCG. The most fitting diagnosis is **congenital megalocornea**. Megalocornea is a non-progressive congenital anomaly characterized by an enlarged corneal diameter (typically $>13 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$), a deep anterior chamber, and a clear cornea, but with normal IOP, normal optic nerve, and normal axial length. It is most commonly an X-linked recessive condition, which is consistent with the patient being male.\n\n4.  **Implications for Surveillance.**\n    While not a form of glaucoma itself, megalocornea is associated with an increased risk of future complications, including:\n    - **Late-onset glaucoma:** Often of a pigmentary or angle-recession type.\n    - **Lens instability (subluxation or dislocation):** Due to stretching of the ciliary body and zonular fibers.\n    - **Cataract formation.**\n    Therefore, a diagnosis of megalocornea necessitates a plan for long-term, periodic surveillance. This surveillance must include monitoring of IOP, ONH status, and biometry (including axial length) to detect any potential conversion to glaucoma or other complications. As there is no current pathology other than the anatomical variant, immediate surgical or medical intervention is not indicated.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Primary congenital glaucoma with atypically normal corneal clarity; perform urgent angle surgery and schedule intensive postoperative monitoring only.**\nThis option incorrectly diagnoses PCG, dismissing the normal IOP, normal axial length, and normal ONH. Proposing urgent surgery on an eye with normal IOP is a violation of fundamental medical principles and would be iatrogenic.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Megalocornea (likely X-linked) with normal IOP and axial length; institute periodic surveillance focused on IOP, ONH, and biometry to detect any late-onset glaucoma or axial elongation, and counsel regarding risks such as lens instability; surgery is not indicated.**\nThis option provides the correct diagnosis that perfectly aligns with all the clinical findings: isolated corneal enlargement with normal IOP, axial length, and ONH. The proposed management plan is entirely appropriate for megalocornea, focusing on surveillance for known associated risks (late-onset glaucoma, lens instability) without recommending unnecessary immediate intervention. The mention of likely X-linked inheritance is also accurate.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Physiologic corneal growth variant; no further follow-up is required because the corneal diameter will normalize as axial length increases with age.**\nThis option trivializes a significant finding. A corneal diameter of $13.5 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$ at $6$ months is pathological, not a physiologic variant. The assertion that it will normalize is incorrect; megalocornea is a permanent anatomical feature. Recommending no follow-up is negligent, as it ignores the well-documented long-term risks associated with the condition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Suspected PCG masked by transiently normal IOP; begin topical beta-blocker therapy and defer surgery unless corneal diameter enlarges beyond $14\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.**\nThis option invokes a \"masked\" disease without sufficient evidence. While IOP in PCG can fluctuate, it is highly improbable for it to be consistently normal while producing a $13.5 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$ cornea without any other signs (no axial elongation, no Haab striae, no optic cupping). Initiating medical therapy with a topical beta-blocker in an infant with normal IOP is not indicated and exposes the infant to unnecessary systemic side effects.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4709570"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the urgency of treating pediatric glaucoma requires moving beyond a simple recognition of high pressure to appreciating its biomechanical consequences.

The derived scaling $\\sigma \\propto r^3$ (for constant pressure with wall volume conservation) shows that modest increases in globe radius substantially amplify scleral wall stress. Here, a radius increase from $r_0$ to $r_1$ yields a stress factor of $\\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_0}\\right)^3 \\approx 1.45$, with an absolute increase of approximately $18 \\, \\mathrm{kPa}$. Elevated wall stress promotes further viscoelastic creep, axial elongation, corneal enlargement and Haab striae, and exacerbates strain transmission to the lamina cribrosa, accelerating optic nerve damage. Mechanical feedback thus favors rapid progression unless IOP is promptly lowered. Given the large, quantifiable stress escalation under persistently high IOP, urgent IOP-lowering surgery (for example, angle surgery such as goniotomy or trabeculotomy) is indicated to interrupt this biomechanical cascade and protect the optic nerve during the critical developmental window.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{18.20}$$", "id": "4709614"}, {"introduction": "The success of glaucoma surgery is ultimately measured by its ability to restore physiological function.

The relationship between intraocular pressure ($IOP$), aqueous humor production ($F$), outflow facility ($C$), and episcleral venous pressure ($P_v$) is described by the Goldmann equation. Under steady-state conditions, the rate of aqueous humor production must equal the rate of aqueous humor outflow.\n\nThe complete Goldmann equation is:\n$$F = C(IOP - P_v) + U$$\nwhere $U$ represents the uveoscleral outflow, which is a pressure-insensitive pathway.\n\nThe problem statement specifies to assume that, for a first-order estimate in a six-month-old infant, uveoscleral outflow is negligible relative to conventional (trabecular) outflow. This simplifies the governing equation by setting $U=0$.
