It describes a classic fluid mechanics scenario—laminar flow through a cylindrical pipe (Poiseuille flow)—which is a suitable model for the situation described. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or violations of physical principles.\n\nThe task is to derive the expression for volumetric flow rate, $Q$, for a Newtonian fluid in steady, laminar flow through a cylindrical tube of radius $r$ and length $L$, driven by a pressure drop $\\Delta P$. This result is known as the Hagen-Poiseuille equation.\n\nWe begin by applying the principle of linear momentum balance to an element of the fluid. We use a cylindrical coordinate system $(\\rho, \\phi, z)$, with the $z$-axis aligned with the lumen's central axis. Due to the assumption of axisymmetric, fully developed flow, the velocity vector has only an axial component, which varies only with the radial position, $v_z(\\rho)$.\n\nConsider a cylindrical fluid element of radius $\\rho$ (where $\\rho \\le r$) and length $L$. The flow is steady, so the net force on this fluid element is zero. The forces acting in the axial direction are the pressure forces on the two circular faces and the viscous shear force on the cylindrical surface.\nThe pressure force acting on the face at the inlet ($z=0$) is $P_{inlet} (\\pi \\rho^2)$, and on the face at the outlet ($z=L$) is $P_{outlet} (\\pi \\rho^2)$. The net pressure force in the direction of flow is $F_P = (P_{inlet} - P_{outlet}) \\pi \\rho^2 = \\Delta P \\pi \\rho^2$.\n\nThe viscous force, $F_V$, arises from shear stress, $\\tau_{\\rho z}$, exerted by the fluid at radial positions greater than $\\rho$ on the fluid within the cylinder of radius $\\rho$. This force acts over the cylindrical surface area $A = 2\\pi \\rho L$ and opposes the direction of net pressure force. The viscous force is $F_V = \\tau_{\\rho z} (2\\pi \\rho L)$.\n\nFor steady flow, the sum of forces is a zero:\n$$F_P + F_V = 0$$\n$$\\Delta P \\pi \\rho^2 + \\tau_{\\rho z} (2\\pi \\rho L) = 0$$\nSolving for the shear stress $\\tau_{\\rho z}$:\n$$\\tau_{\\rho z} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2L}\\rho$$\nFor a Newtonian fluid, the shear stress is proportional to the velocity gradient:\n$$\\tau_{\\rho z} = \\eta \\frac{dv_z}{d\\rho}$$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity.\n\nEquating the two expressions for $\\tau_{\\rho z}$ gives a first-order ordinary differential equation for the velocity $v_z$:\n$$\\eta \\frac{dv_z}{d\\rho} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2L}\\rho$$\n$$\\frac{dv_z}{d\\rho} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta L}\\rho$$\nWe integrate this equation with respect to $\\rho$ to find the velocity profile:\n$$v_z(\\rho) = \\int -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta L}\\rho \\,d\\rho = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L}\\rho^2 + C_1$$\nThe constant of integration $C_1$ is determined by the no-slip boundary condition at the lumen wall, which states that the fluid velocity is zero at the wall ($\\rho=r$).\n$$v_z(r) = 0 \\implies 0 = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L}r^2 + C_1$$\n$$C_1 = \\frac{\\Delta P r^2}{4\\eta L}$$\nSubstituting $C_1$ back into the velocity expression yields the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$v_z(\\rho) = \\frac{\\Delta P r^2}{4\\eta L} - \\frac{\\Delta P \\rho^2}{4\\eta L} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L}(r^2 - \\rho^2)$$\nTo find the total volumetric flow rate $Q$, we integrate this velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the lumen.

The relationship is given by:\n$$h(t|\\mathbf{X}) = h_0(t) \\exp(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^T \\mathbf{X})$$\nThe term $\\exp(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^T \\mathbf{X})$ is the total hazard ratio ($HR_{total}$) for the patient relative to a reference patient for whom all covariates are at their baseline levels. This total hazard ratio is the product of the individual hazard ratios for each covariate.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the $HR_{total}$ for the specific patient described. We compare the patient's characteristics to the reference patient's characteristics one by one.\n\n1.  **Age:** The patient's age is $70$ years, while the reference age is $50$ years. This is a difference of $+20$ years, which corresponds to two $+10$-year increments. The HR per $+10$ years is $1.12$. Thus, the HR for age is $(1.12)^2$.\n    $HR_{age} = (1.12)^2 = 1.2544$\n\n2.  **Preoperative IOP:** The patient's preoperative IOP is $30$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, while the reference is $20$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$. This is a difference of $+10$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, which corresponds to two $+5$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ increments. The HR per $+5$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ is $1.20$. Thus, the HR for IOP is $(1.20)^2$.\n    $HR_{IOP} = (1.20)^2 = 1.44$\n\n3.  **Diagnosis:** The patient has Neovascular Glaucoma (NVG), while the reference has Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG). The HR for NVG vs POAG is given directly as $1.80$.\n    $HR_{diagnosis} = 1.80$\n\n4.  **MMC use:** The patient used Mitomycin-C, while the reference did not. The HR for MMC use is given as $0.65$.\n    $HR_{MMC} = 0.65$\n\n5.  **Surgeon Volume:** The patient's surgeon has an annual volume of $100$ cases, while the reference surgeon has a volume of $50$ cases. This is a difference of $+50$ cases. The HR per $+50$ additional cases is given as $0.85$.\n    $HR_{volume} = 0.85$\n\n6.  **Prior Surgery:** The patient has no prior incisional glaucoma surgery, which is the same as the reference. Therefore, the HR for this covariate is $1.0$.\n    $HR_{prior\\_surg} = 1.0$\n\nThe total hazard ratio, $HR_{total}$, is the product of these individual HRs:\n$$HR_{total} = HR_{age} \\times HR_{IOP} \\times HR_{diagnosis} \\times HR_{MMC} \\times HR_{volume} \\times HR_{prior\\_surg}$$\n$$HR_{total} = (1.2544) \\times (1.44) \\times (1.80) \\times (0.65) \\times (0.85) \\times (1.0)$$\n$$HR_{total} \\approx 1.796401152$$\n\nNext, we determine the patient's cumulative hazard function, $H(t)$, by $t = 24$ months.
