Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios are fundamental concepts for evaluating the performance of diagnostic tests. The values provided for the ACE test in the context of sarcoidosis are clinically plausible.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all the necessary information to derive the formula and calculate the requested value. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, precise language, free of subjective claims or bias.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. The definitions of sensitivity and specificity are sufficient to derive the likelihood ratio.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has ocular sarcoidosis, and let $D^c$ be the complement event, that the patient does not have ocular sarcoidosis.\nLet $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result (elevated ACE), and let $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe problem provides the following test characteristics, which are defined as conditional probabilities:\n1.  **Sensitivity**: The probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present.\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = P(T^+ | D) = 0.60 $$\n2.  **Specificity**: The probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent.\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.85 $$\n\nThe **positive likelihood ratio ($\\text{LR}^+$)** is defined as the ratio of the probability of a positive test result in a person with the disease to the probability of a positive test result in a person without the disease. Formally, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\text{LR}^+ = \\frac{P(T^+ | D)}{P(T^+ | D^c)} $$\n\nThe numerator of this expression, $P(T^+ | D)$, is given directly as the sensitivity.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+ | D^c)$, is the probability of a false positive. This value can be derived from the specificity. The events of a positive test ($T^+$) and a negative test ($T^-$) are mutually exclusive and exhaustive for a given condition. Therefore, for the population without the disease ($D^c$), the sum of the probabilities of a positive test and a negative test must equal $1$.\n$$ P(T^+ | D^c) + P(T^- | D^c) = 1 $$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $P(T^+ | D^c)$:\n$$ P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) $$\n\nSubstituting the definition of specificity, $P(T^- | D^c) = \\text{Specificity}$, into this equation gives:\n$$ P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - \\text{Specificity} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into the definition of $\\text{LR}^+$. This provides the general formula for $\\text{LR}^+$ in terms of sensitivity and specificity, as derived from first principles:\n$$ \\text{LR}^+ = \\frac{\\text{Sensitivity}}{1 - \\text{Specificity}} $$\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for the given ACE test. We are given:\n- $\\text{Sensitivity} = 0.60$\n- $\\text{Specificity} = 0.85$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ \\text{LR}^+ = \\frac{0.60}{1 - 0.85} $$\n$$ \\text{LR}^+ = \\frac{0.60}{0.15} $$\n$$ \\text{LR}^+ = \\frac{60}{15} = 4 $$\n\nThe positive likelihood ratio for the ACE test in this population is exactly $4$.\n\nFinally, a brief interpretation of this result. The likelihood ratio is a multiplier for the odds of disease. The relationship is given by Bayes' theorem in odds form: $\\text{Post-test Odds} = \\text{Pre-test Odds} \\times \\text{LR}$. An $\\text{LR}^+$ of $4$ indicates that a positive ACE test result increases the odds of the patient having ocular sarcoidosis by a factor of $4$. For example, if the pre-test odds were $1:10$, a positive test would increase them to $4:10$. In clinical contexts, an $\\text{LR}^+$ between $2$ and $5$ is considered to generate a small but often useful change in post-test probability, strengthening the suspicion of disease but not being sufficient for a definitive diagnosis on its own.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "4724493"}, {"introduction": "Managing severe, sight-threatening uveitis often begins with high-dose systemic corticosteroids, but the true art of treatment lies in the subsequent taper. A well-designed taper is critical for balancing therapeutic efficacy against the significant risks of steroid toxicity and adrenal suppression. This practical exercise challenges you to construct a clinically sound prednisone tapering schedule based on established safety constraints, a core task in the longitudinal management of patients with sarcoidosis or Behçet uveitis [@problem_id:4724544].", "problem": "A patient with sight-threatening bilateral noninfectious uveitis consistent with systemic sarcoidosis versus Behçet disease requires induction with systemic corticosteroids, followed by a taper designed to suppress ocular inflammation while minimizing risk of flare and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Let the daily prednisone dose be constant within each week and denote the week-$k$ daily dose by $d_{k}$ for $k \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,8\\}$. The taper spans $8$ consecutive weeks, starting at $60$ mg/day in week $1$ and reaching $0$ mg/day immediately after the end of week $8$ (that is, the patient stops prednisone at the completion of week $8$). The schedule must satisfy both of the following design constraints grounded in standard clinical practice for these uveitides: \n- From the start ($60$ mg/day) down to $20$ mg/day, weekly decreases must not exceed $10$ mg/day. \n- Once at $20$ mg/day, subsequent weekly steps must be exactly $5$ mg/day.\n\nAssume each week consists of $7$ consecutive days at the stated daily dose, there is no alternate-day dosing, and dose changes occur at the boundary between weeks. Construct a feasible sequence $\\{d_{k}\\}_{k=1}^{8}$ that satisfies the above constraints and achieves cessation (i.e., $0$ mg/day) immediately after week $8$, and then compute the cumulative prednisone exposure over the $8$ weeks.

The taper consists of a sequence of daily doses $\\{d_{k}\\}_{k=1}^{8}$, where $d_k$ is the constant daily dose in mg for week $k$, and $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 8\\}$.\n2.  The starting dose for week $1$ is $d_1 = 60$ mg/day.\n3.  The taper duration is $8$ weeks, and the dose becomes $0$ mg/day immediately after the end of week $8$. This implies $d_8 > 0$ and the dose for a hypothetical week $9$, $d_9$, would be $0$.\n4.  Constraint 1: For doses from $60$ mg/day down to $20$ mg/day, weekly decreases must not exceed $10$ mg/day. This can be stated as: if $d_k > 20$, then $d_k - d_{k+1} \\le 10$.\n5.  Constraint 2: Once the dose is at $20$ mg/day, subsequent weekly steps must be exactly $5$ mg/day. This can be stated as: if $d_k = 20$, then for any week $j > k$, the decrease $d_{j-1} - d_j = 5$.\n6.  Each week consists of $7$ days.\n7.  The final result is the cumulative prednisone exposure over the $8$ weeks, expressed in mg.\n\n**Validation:**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is grounded in clinical pharmacology and rheumatology/ophthalmology. The dosage ($60$ mg/day prednisone), the concept of a taper, and the specific constraints on decrements are standard practice for managing systemic inflammatory conditions to balance efficacy and side effects like HPA axis suppression. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem requires finding a sequence that satisfies a set of clear, mathematical constraints. As will be shown, these constraints uniquely determine the sequence, leading to a single, well-defined solution for the cumulative dose.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective language and numerical constraints. There is no ambiguity or subjective component.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Constructing the Dose Sequence $\\{d_k\\}$\n\nThe problem can be solved by breaking it into two parts based on the constraints and working backwards from the end condition.\n\n**Part A: The Taper from $20$ mg/day downwards**\n\nConstraint 2 dictates the tail end of the taper. Once the dose reaches $20$ mg/day, all subsequent decrements are exactly $5$ mg/day per week. The taper must conclude at the end of week $8$, meaning $d_9=0$. We can reconstruct the sequence backwards from this point.\n- The dose in week $8$, $d_8$, must be the last non-zero dose. For the dose to become $0$ in the next step, according to the $5$ mg/day rule, $d_8$ must be $5$ mg/day. So, $d_8 = 5$.\n- The dose in week $7$, $d_7$, must be $d_8 + 5$. Therefore, $d_7 = 5 + 5 = 10$.\n- The dose in week $6$, $d_6$, must be $d_7 + 5$. Therefore, $d_6 = 10 + 5 = 15$.\n- The dose in week $5$, $d_5$, must be $d_6 + 5$. Therefore, $d_5 = 15 + 5 = 20$.\n\nThis establishes the latter half of the dose sequence. The first week where the dose is $\\le 20$ mg/day is week $5$, with $d_5 = 20$. The sequence for weeks $5$ through $8$ is $\\{20, 15, 10, 5\\}$.\n\n**Part B: The Taper from $60$ mg/day down to $20$ mg/day**\n\nNow, we must connect the starting dose $d_1 = 60$ to the dose $d_5 = 20$ over the first $4$ weeks. The doses $d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4$ are all greater than $20$ mg/day, so Constraint 1 applies. Let $\\Delta_k = d_k - d_{k+1}$ be the decrease in daily dose between week $k$ and week $k+1$.\n\nFor $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, since $d_k \\ge d_4 > d_5 = 20$, Constraint 1 implies that $\\Delta_k \\le 10$.\n\nThe total decrease from week $1$ to week $5$ is $d_1 - d_5 = 60 - 20 = 40$ mg/day. This total decrease is the sum of the four weekly decreases:\n$$ \\Delta_1 + \\Delta_2 + \\Delta_3 + \\Delta_4 = 40 $$\nWe have a system where four variables, $\\Delta_1, \\Delta_2, \\Delta_3, \\Delta_4$, must sum to $40$, with each variable being subject to the constraint $\\Delta_k \\le 10$.\n\nLet's analyze this system. The maximum possible value for the sum is $10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40$. Since the sum is required to be exactly $40$, each term must achieve its maximum possible value. If any $\\Delta_k < 10$, say $\\Delta_i = 10 - \\epsilon$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$, then the sum of the remaining three terms would need to be $30 + \\epsilon$. However, the maximum possible sum of the other three terms is $3 \\times 10 = 30$, leading to a contradiction. Thus, the only possible solution is that each decrease must be exactly $10$.\n$$ \\Delta_1 = \\Delta_2 = \\Delta_3 = \\Delta_4 = 10 $$\nUsing these decreases, we can determine the first four doses:\n- $d_1 = 60$ (given)\n- $d_2 = d_1 - \\Delta_1 = 60 - 10 = 50$\n- $d_3 = d_2 - \\Delta_2 = 50 - 10 = 40$\n- $d_4 = d_3 - \\Delta_3 = 40 - 10 = 30$\n- A check for $d_5$: $d_5 = d_4 - \\Delta_4 = 30 - 10 = 20$. This matches our result from Part A, confirming the consistency of the entire sequence.\n\n**The Complete Feasible Sequence:**\nThe unique feasible dose sequence is:\n$\\{d_k\\}_{k=1}^{8} = \\{60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 15, 10, 5\\}$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Cumulative Prednisone Exposure\n\nThe cumulative dose, $D_{total}$, is the sum of the total dose administered each week. Since each week $k$ has $7$ days with a daily dose of $d_k$, the total dose for that week is $7 \\cdot d_k$. The cumulative dose over $8$ weeks is:\n$$ D_{total} = \\sum_{k=1}^{8} (7 \\cdot d_k) = 7 \\cdot \\sum_{k=1}^{8} d_k $$\nWe compute the sum of the weekly daily doses:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{8} d_k = 60 + 50 + 40 + 30 + 20 + 15 + 10 + 5 $$\nThe sum can be calculated as:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{8} d_k = (60 + 50 + 40 + 30) + (20 + 15 + 10 + 5) $$\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{8} d_k = 180 + 50 = 230 $$\nNow, we calculate the total cumulative dose:\n$$ D_{total} = 7 \\cdot 230 $$\n$$ D_{total} = 1610 $$\nThe cumulative prednisone exposure over the $8$-week period is $1610$ mg.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1610}$$", "id": "4724544"}, {"introduction": "Modern uveitis management is increasingly moving towards quantitative, objective assessments of treatment success, especially in the context of clinical trials and biologic therapies.
