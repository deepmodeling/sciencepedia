No pain, photophobia, or redness. No history of cutaneous vesicular eruptions, systemic joint or skin disease, or pulmonary symptoms.\n-   **Visual Acuity (Best-Corrected):** Right Eye (OD): `$20/40$`. Left Eye (OS): `$20/20$`.\n-   **Intraocular Pressure (IOP):** OD: `$17$ mmHg. OS: `$16$ mmHg.\n-   **Right Eye Examination:**\n    -   **Anterior Segment:** Quiet conjunctiva; deep anterior chamber (AC) with trace cells (approx. `$5$ cells per high-power field`); numerous fine, stellate keratic precipitates (KPs) evenly distributed over the entire corneal endothelium; no posterior synechiae; diffuse iris stromal atrophy without nodules; subtle transillumination defects, no sectoral defects; posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC).\n    -   **Corneal Sensation:** Intact.\n    -   **Posterior Segment:** Mild vitreous cells without snowballs; retina is otherwise normal.\n-   **Left Eye Examination:** Normal.\n-   **Task:** Select the single diagnosis that best accounts for all observed features using a structured differential diagnosis based on core clinicopathologic principles.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem presents a clinical case vignette in ophthalmology. All symptoms, signs (e.g., KPs, iris atrophy, PSC), and measurements (visual acuity, IOP) are standard, well-defined clinical entities. The differential diagnoses (A-E) are all established causes of uveitis. The problem is based on established medical science.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a detailed and coherent set of clinical findings and asks for the most likely diagnosis from a list of options. This is a standard and well-posed problem in clinical reasoning. The information is sufficient to arrive at a single best answer through the process of differential diagnosis.\n-   **Objective:** The description of the clinical findings is objective, using standard ophthalmologic terminology (e.g., \"fine, stellate keratic precipitates\", \"diffuse stromal atrophy\", \"posterior subcapsular cataract\"). It is free of subjective or ambiguous language.\n-   **Consistency and Completeness:** The clinical findings are internally consistent. A chronic, low-grade, insidious inflammatory process is consistent with the lack of pain/redness, the presence of a PSC, and the mild cellular reaction over a `$6$-month` period. The set of findings forms a recognizable clinical syndrome.\n-   **Realism:** The patient's age, presentation, and specific constellation of signs are realistic and represent a classic presentation of a particular uveitic syndrome.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a scientifically sound, objective, and well-posed clinical reasoning problem. Proceeding to solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe task is to identify the single best diagnosis by systematically applying core clinicopathologic principles to the patient's presentation. We will analyze the key features of the case and then evaluate each diagnostic option.\n\n**Systematic Analysis of Clinical Features:**\n\n1.  **Onset and Course:** The presentation is chronic (progressive for `$6$ months`) and insidious (subtle blur, no acute symptoms like pain, redness, or photophobia). This immediately makes acute conditions less likely.\n2.  **Laterality:** The condition is unilateral, affecting only the right eye.\n3.  **Inflammation Type  Location:** This is a low-grade iridocyclitis (anterior uveitis involving the iris and ciliary body). The evidence includes:\n    -   Anterior chamber cells (\"trace cells\").\n    -   Keratic precipitates (KPs) on the endothelium.\n    -   Vitreous cells (\"mild vitreous cells\"), indicating inflammation extends to the anterior vitreous, which is common in iridocyclitis.\n    -   The inflammation is \"cold\" or nongranulomatous in appearance, given the quiet eye and fine KPs.\n4.  **Keratic Precipitates (KPs):** The morphology is described as \"numerous, fine, stellate\" and the distribution is \"evenly distributed over the entire corneal endothelium\". This \"starry sky\" appearance is a highly specific sign. It contrasts with large, greasy \"mutton-fat\" KPs seen in granulomatous uveitis, or KPs concentrated inferiorly in Arlt's triangle.\n5.  **Intraocular Pressure (IOP):** The IOP is normal and symmetric (`$17$ mmHg vs. `$16$ mmHg). This rules out conditions defined by acute, severe IOP spikes.\n6.  **Iris Changes:** The iris shows \"diffuse stromal atrophy\" and \"subtle transillumination defects\" but explicitly lacks \"nodules\" and \"sectoral defects\". Diffuse atrophy is a key finding, often leading to a lighter-colored iris (heterochromia), and its presence without sectoral defects is diagnostically crucial.\n7.  **Synechiae:** The absence of posterior synechiae is remarkable for a chronic uveitis and is a very strong diagnostic clue. Intense or prolonged inflammation typically causes the iris to adhere to the lens.\n8.  **Lens:** A posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC) is present. This is a known complication of chronic intraocular inflammation.\n9.  **Corneal Sensation:** \"Intact\" corneal sensation is a pivotal negative finding.\n10. **Systemic Context:** The patient is systemically well, with no history of skin rashes/vesicles, joint disease, or pulmonary symptoms. This makes primary systemic diseases less likely culprits.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Fuchs uveitis syndrome (Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis)**\n\nThis syndrome is a chronic, typically unilateral, low-grade iridocyclitis.\n-   **Clinical Fit:** The patient's presentation is a textbook example of Fuchs uveitis syndrome.\n    -   **Course:** Chronic, insidious, often presenting with blurred vision from cataract or floaters. Matches the patient.\n    -   **Inflammation:** Low-grade, quiet eye with few cells. Matches \"trace cells\" and \"quiet conjunctiva\".\n    -   **KPs:** Characteristically fine, stellate, and diffusely distributed. Matches the description perfectly.\n    -   **Iris:** Diffuse stromal atrophy is the pathognomonic feature, causing heterochromia (the \"heterochromic\" part of the name). Absence of nodules is typical. Matches perfectly.\n    -   **Synechiae:** Characteristically absent, despite the chronic nature of the inflammation. Matches perfectly.\n    -   **Lens  Vitreous:** PSC and mild vitritis are extremely common complications. Matches perfectly.\n    -   **IOP:** Can be normal or elevated (Fuchs-associated glaucoma). Normal IOP is consistent.\n-   **Verdict:** This diagnosis accounts for every single positive and negative finding in the case. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Herpetic anterior uveitis (Herpes simplex virus or Varicella zoster virus)**\n\nThis is uveitis caused by a herpesvirus infection.\n-   **Clinical Fit:** While it can be chronic and low-grade, it has several characteristic features that are absent in this patient.\n    -   **Corneal Sensation:** Herpes viruses are neurotropic and characteristically cause **reduced corneal sensation**. The finding of \"intact\" corneal sensation is strong evidence against this diagnosis.\n    -   **Iris Atrophy:** Herpetic uveitis classically causes **sectoral** or patchy iris atrophy, not diffuse atrophy. The problem explicitly states \"sectoral defects are absent\".\n    -   **IOP:** Is often significantly elevated.\n    -   **History:** Absence of a history of vesicular rash (shingles or cold sores) also makes it less likely, though not impossible.\n-   **Verdict:** The intact corneal sensation and the pattern of iris atrophy are major arguments against this diagnosis. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Posner–Schlossman syndrome (glaucomatocyclitic crisis)**\n\nThis syndrome is characterized by recurrent, acute attacks of very high IOP with minimal inflammation.\n-   **Clinical Fit:** The clinical picture is entirely inconsistent with the patient's presentation.\n    -   **Course:** Posner-Schlossman is acute and recurrent, not chronic and progressive.\n    -   **IOP:** The defining feature is a crisis of very high IOP (e.g., `$40-60$` mmHg). This patient's IOP is normal.\n    -   **Complications:** It does not typically cause the profound iris atrophy or cataracts seen in this patient.\n-   **Verdict:** The clinical course and IOP profile are completely wrong for this diagnosis. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Human Leukocyte Antigen B27 (HLA-B27)-associated acute anterior uveitis**\n\nThis is an immune-mediated uveitis strongly associated with the HLA-B27 gene.\n-   **Clinical Fit:** The presentation is the antithesis of this patient's case.\n    -   **Course:** It is characteristically an **acute**, sudden-onset, and highly symptomatic (severe pain, photophobia, redness) uveitis. This patient's course is chronic and insidious.\n    -   **Inflammation:** The inflammation is typically intense, often with fibrinous exudate in the anterior chamber. **Posterior synechiae** are a very common complication. This patient has low-grade inflammation and no synechiae.\n    -   **Systemic:** It is often linked to systemic spondyloarthropathies, which the patient does not have.\n-   **Verdict:** The chronicity, symptomatology, and clinical signs are all inconsistent with HLA-B27-associated uveitis. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Sarcoidosis-related anterior uveitis**\n\nSarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that can affect the eye.\n-   **Clinical Fit:** While sarcoidosis can cause chronic uveitis, the typical signs are different.\n    -   **KPs:** The classic KPs in sarcoidosis are large, greasy \"mutton-fat\" KPs, indicative of granulomatous inflammation. While other types can occur, the fine, stellate, diffuse pattern is not characteristic.\n    -   **Iris Nodules:** Koeppe nodules (at the pupillary margin) and Busacca nodules (on the iris stroma) are hallmarks of sarcoid-related uveitis. This patient has \"no nodules\".\n    -   **Posterior Segment:** Vitreous involvement can include dense inflammatory aggregates (\"snowballs,\" \"strings of pearls\"), which this patient lacks.\n    -   **Systemic:** Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease, and the patient's lack of any systemic symptoms (especially pulmonary) makes it a less likely diagnosis of exclusion.\n-   **Verdict:** The patient lacks the characteristic granulomatous features (mutton-fat KPs, iris nodules) of ocular sarcoidosis. **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe patient's constellation of findings—unilateral, chronic, asymptomatic, low-grade iridocyclitis with fine stellate KPs, diffuse iris atrophy without sectoral defects, absence of posterior synechiae, presence of PSC and vitritis, and intact corneal sensation—is pathognomonic for Fuchs uveitis syndrome.

The Goldmann-Witmer coefficient (GWC) is a cornerstone of infectious uveitis diagnostics, providing mathematical proof of intraocular antibody synthesis.

Then, based on well-established interpretive thresholds in uveitis diagnostics, briefly justify whether this result supports intraocular synthesis of anti-herpes simplex virus immunoglobulin G, consistent with herpetic anterior uveitis rather than Fuchs heterochromic uveitis.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of immunology and ophthalmology, specifically the use of the Goldmann-Witmer coefficient (GWC) for diagnosing infectious uveitis. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary quantitative data and a clear qualitative definition from which a formal expression can be derived. The data are dimensionally consistent and within a plausible physiological range. The task is objective and requires a calculation followed by an interpretation based on established clinical criteria.\n\nTo solve the problem, we must first formalize the definition of the Goldmann-Witmer coefficient. Let us define the following variables based on the provided data:\n$A_{spec}$ = Concentration of specific anti-herpes simplex virus type 1 IgG in the aqueous humor, given as $4.50$ IU/mL.\n$A_{total}$ = Concentration of total immunoglobulin G in the aqueous humor, given as $0.060$ mg/mL.\n$S_{spec}$ = Concentration of specific anti-herpes simplex virus type 1 IgG in the serum, given as $180$ IU/mL.\n$S_{total}$ = Concentration of total immunoglobulin G in the serum, given as $12.0$ mg/mL.\n\nThe problem defines the GWC as a measure that \"quantifies the relative enrichment of pathogen-specific immunoglobulin G in aqueous humor when normalized to total immunoglobulin G, compared with the corresponding relative measure in serum.\" We can translate this statement into a mathematical expression from first principles.\n\nFirst, \"the relative enrichment of pathogen-specific immunoglobulin G in aqueous humor when normalized to total immunoglobulin G\" is the ratio of the specific antibody concentration to the total antibody concentration in the aqueous humor. Let us call this term $R_{aqueous}$.\n$$\nR_{aqueous} = \\frac{A_{spec}}{A_{total}}\n$$\n\nSecond, \"the corresponding relative measure in serum\" is the analogous ratio in the serum. Let us call this term $R_{serum}$.\n$$\nR_{serum} = \\frac{S_{spec}}{S_{total}}\n$$\n\nFinally, the GWC \"compares\" the aqueous humor measure with the serum measure. In this context, \"compares\" signifies taking the ratio of the two previously derived quantities. Therefore, the Goldmann-Witmer coefficient (GWC) is defined as:\n$$\nGWC = \\frac{R_{aqueous}}{R_{serum}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $R_{aqueous}$ and $R_{serum}$, we obtain the complete formula for the GWC:\n$$\nGWC = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{A_{spec}}{A_{total}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{S_{spec}}{S_{total}} \\right)}\n$$\nThis expression can be rearranged for calculation as:\n$$\nGWC = \\frac{A_{spec}}{A_{total}} \\times \\frac{S_{total}}{S_{spec}}\n$$\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values into this expression. It is important to note that the units (IU/mL and mg/mL) will cancel out, yielding a dimensionless coefficient as required.\n\nLet's compute the value of $R_{aqueous}$:\n$$\nR_{aqueous} = \\frac{4.50 \\, \\text{IU/mL}}{0.060 \\, \\text{mg/mL}} = 75 \\, \\text{IU/mg}\n$$\n\nNext, let's compute the value of $R_{serum}$:\n$$\nR_{serum} = \\frac{180 \\, \\text{IU/mL}}{12.0 \\, \\text{mg/mL}} = 15 \\, \\text{IU/mg}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the GWC:\n$$\nGWC = \\frac{75 \\, \\text{IU/mg}}{15 \\, \\text{IU/mg}} = 5.0\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Thus, the computed value is $5.00$.\n\nThe final part of the task is to interpret this result. In uveitis diagnostics, the GWC is a key indicator of intraocular antibody synthesis. A GWC value of $1.0$ would indicate that the proportion of specific antibodies to total IgG in the aqueous humor is the same as in the blood, suggesting that all antibodies in the eye passively diffused from the circulation through the blood-aqueous barrier. A value greater than $1.0$ suggests local production of antibodies within the eye. Well-established clinical thresholds are used for interpretation. A GWC value $\\geq 3$ is generally considered definitive evidence for significant intraocular synthesis of the specific antibody in question.\n\nOur calculated GWC is $5.00$. Since $5.00 \\geq 3$, this result strongly supports the hypothesis of intraocular synthesis of anti-herpes simplex virus IgG. This finding is a hallmark of herpetic anterior uveitis, where the virus actively replicates within the eye, triggering a local immune response. Conversely, a high GWC for HSV would not be expected, as Fuchs heterochromic uveitis is not caused by an active HSV infection (it is most commonly associated with the rubella virus). Therefore, a high GWC for HSV would not be expected. The calculated GWC value powerfully points towards a diagnosis of herpetic anterior uveitis over Fuchs heterochromic uveitis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5.00}$$", "id": "4679114"}, {"introduction": "Expert clinical practice involves navigating diagnostic uncertainty, especially when laboratory results appear to conflict with strong clinical evidence.

Examination reveals intraocular pressure (IOP) of $36$ mmHg in the right eye versus $16$ mmHg in the left eye, $1+$ anterior chamber (AC) cells, and pigmented, granulomatous keratic precipitates (KPs) predominantly inferiorly. The corneal sensation, measured by Cochet–Bonnet esthesiometry, is reduced at $35$ mm in the right eye compared to $60$ mm in the left eye. There are subtle sectoral iris transillumination defects in the right eye. There is no epithelial dendrite, and the vitreous has no obvious cells. Gonioscopy is not yet performed. There is no heterochromia. \n\nFoundational base for reasoning:\n- Viral neurotropism of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) along ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve reduces corneal sensation by damaging corneal innervation; this clinical sign has high discriminative value when present.\n- Inflammatory trabeculitis reduces outflow facility, increasing IOP according to the aqueous humor dynamics principle that IOP rises when outflow resistance increases; conceptually, if aqueous production is $F$ and outflow facility is $C$, elevation of IOP reflects decreased $C$ relative to episcleral venous pressure $P_e$, with IOP behaving qualitatively like $P_e + F/C$ under steady-state conditions.\n- Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis (Fuchs uveitis syndrome) is a chronic, typically painless, unilateral anterior uveitis with diffuse, small, stellate KPs distributed across the endothelium, normal corneal sensation, frequent vitreous cells, and heterochromia that may be subtle; inflammation is low-grade and steroid-insensitive, and IOP elevation may occur but trabeculitis-type acute spikes are less typical.\n- Cytomegalovirus (CMV) anterior uveitis in immunocompetent adults may present with hypertensive uveitis and coin-shaped KPs or endotheliitis; diagnostic confirmation often relies on Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of aqueous humor.\n\nYou obtain an aqueous humor Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for HSV/VZV, which returns negative. Based on local validation data, the sensitivity of PCR for detecting HSV/VZV in acute anterior uveitis is $Se = 0.60$ and the specificity is $Sp = 0.97$.

Diagnose Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis on the basis of pigmented KPs and unilateral IOP elevation; avoid corticosteroids because Fuchs uveitis is steroid-insensitive; treat IOP with prostaglandin analog monotherapy and plan early cataract surgery; corneal sensation testing and gonioscopy are unnecessary; antivirals and PCR are not indicated.\n\nC. Presume cytomegalovirus endotheliitis; immediately obtain aqueous humor PCR and delay all treatment until PCR results are available; use miotics as first-line to lower IOP; if HSV/VZV PCR is negative, rule out viral etiologies and treat with high-dose topical steroids long-term.\n\nD.

It presents a detailed, self-contained, and scientifically grounded clinical scenario in ophthalmology, requiring the application of pathophysiology, clinical diagnostics, and probabilistic reasoning (Bayes' theorem) to determine the optimal management strategy. The provided data are consistent and realistic. The question is well-posed and objective.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\n**1. Clinical Phenotype Analysis**\nThe patient presents with a unilateral, acute anterior uveitis. Key features point towards a specific etiology:\n- **Hypertensive Uveitis**: The intraocular pressure (IOP) is significantly elevated at $36$ mmHg in the affected eye, compared to $16$ mmHg in the fellow eye. This suggests an inflammatory trabeculitis, obstructing aqueous humor outflow.\n- **Granulomatous Keratic Precipitates (KPs)**: These are large, \"mutton-fat\" inflammatory cell deposits on the corneal endothelium.\n- **Reduced Corneal Sensation**: Sensation is markedly decreased in the affected eye ($35$ mm) compared to the normal fellow eye ($60$ mm). As stated in the foundational principles, this is a strong indicator of herpetic viral neurotropism affecting the trigeminal nerve.\n- **Sectoral Iris Atrophy**: The subtle transillumination defects are classic for ischemic necrosis of the iris caused by herpetic viruses (HSV or VZV).\n\nThese signs, in combination (high IOP, reduced sensation, iris atrophy), create a clinical picture highly characteristic of herpetic anterior uveitis. The pre-test probability of $p_0 = 0.80$ is therefore well-justified.\n\nThe findings argue strongly against Fuchs uveitis, which is typically characterized by normal corneal sensation, diffuse stellate KPs, a chronic and painless course, and the frequent presence of heterochromia and vitritis, all of which are absent or contrary to the findings in this case.\n\n**2. Bayesian Interpretation of the PCR Result**\nThe core of the problem lies in correctly interpreting the negative HSV/VZV PCR result. A naive interpretation might be to rule out herpetic disease. However, a rigorous probabilistic approach using Bayes' theorem is required.\n\nLet $D$ be the event of having herpetic disease, and $T_{neg}$ be the event of a negative PCR test. We want to find the posterior probability $P(D|T_{neg})$.\n\nGiven:\n- Pre-test probability: $P(D) = p_0 = 0.80$\n- Sensitivity of the test: $S_e = P(T_{pos}|D) = 0.60$\n- Specificity of the test: $S_p = P(T_{neg}|D^c) = 0.97$\n\nFrom this, we derive related probabilities:\n- Prior probability of not having the disease: $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$\n- Probability of a negative test given disease (false negative rate): $P(T_{neg}|D) = 1 - S_e = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$\n\nUsing the law of total probability, the overall probability of a negative test, $P(T_{neg})$, is:\n$$ P(T_{neg}) = P(T_{neg}|D)P(D) + P(T_{neg}|D^c)P(D^c) $$\n$$ P(T_{neg}) = (0.40)(0.80) + (0.97)(0.20) $$\n$$ P(T_{neg}) = 0.32 + 0.194 = 0.514 $$\n\nNow, applying Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:\n$$ P(D|T_{neg}) = \\frac{P(T_{neg}|D)P(D)}{P(T_{neg})} $$\n$$ P(D|T_{neg}) = \\frac{0.32}{0.514} \\approx 0.6226 $$\n\nTherefore, even after a negative PCR result, the posterior probability of herpetic uveitis is approximately $62\\%$. This is a substantial probability and is more likely than not. The reason is the combination of a very high pre-test probability based on strong clinical signs and the modest sensitivity ($S_e = 0.60$) of the test, leading to a significant false negative rate.\n\n**3. Formulation of Initial Management Strategy**\nBased on the high post-test probability, management must proceed with the assumption that herpetic uveitis is the most likely diagnosis.\n- **Control Inflammation**: Topical corticosteroids are essential to treat the anterior chamber inflammation ($1+$ cells).\n- **Address Etiology**: Systemic antiviral therapy (e.g., oral valacyclovir) is mandatory to treat the underlying viral infection, given the high probability.\n- **Control IOP**: The dangerously high IOP of $36$ mmHg requires immediate treatment with aqueous suppressants (e.g., beta-blockers, alpha-agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors). Prostaglandin analogs and miotics (e.g., pilocarpine) are contraindicated in active uveitis; prostaglandins can be pro-inflammatory, and miotics can increase posterior synechiae formation and ciliary spasm.\n- **Supportive Care**: Cycloplegic drops (e.g., cyclopentolate) are needed to prevent posterior synechiae and provide comfort.\n- **Further Workup**: Gonioscopy should be performed to assess the iridocorneal angle once the clinical view allows.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A.** This option proposes a comprehensive evaluation (corneal sensation, KPs, iris atrophy, IOP, gonioscopy). It correctly recommends initiating topical corticosteroids, cycloplegia, systemic antivirals, and aqueous suppressants, while correctly avoiding prostaglandin analogs and miotics. Crucially, it correctly states that the posterior probability after a negative PCR remains substantial enough to justify antiviral therapy, which aligns perfectly with our Bayesian calculation. It also includes appropriate long-term planning (prophylaxis).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option incorrectly diagnoses Fuchs uveitis, ignoring multiple contradictory clinical signs. It recommends avoiding corticosteroids (dangerous), using a contraindicated prostaglandin analog, and omitting essential diagnostic tests like corneal sensation and gonioscopy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option incorrectly presumes CMV endotheliitis as the primary diagnosis, despite signs being more typical for HSV/VZV. It advocates for a dangerous delay in treatment pending PCR results, which could lead to irreversible optic nerve damage from high IOP. It incorrectly recommends miotics for IOP control and makes the critical error of \"ruling out\" viral causes based on a negative PCR, which our analysis has shown to be statistically invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option incorrectly dismisses the highly specific signs as \"nonspecific.\" It recommends withholding essential antiviral therapy. It dangerously recommends contraindicated medications (prostaglandin analogs, pilocarpine) for IOP and a contraindicated procedure (laser trabeculoplasty) during active inflammation. It provides an unscientific ad-hoc explanation for the reduced corneal sensation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4678966"}]}
