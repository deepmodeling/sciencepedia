Best-corrected visual acuity is $20/20$ in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination shows a quiet anterior chamber with $0$ cells and no keratic precipitates. The vitreous is optically clear without cells or haze. Fundus examination of the right eye reveals a solitary, well-circumscribed, approximately $1$-disc-diameter focus of retinal whitening in the inferotemporal arcade with subtle perilesional edema and no visible retinal vasculitis. Fluorescein Angiography (FA) demonstrates early hypofluorescence with late staining of the lesion; Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) shows a localized hyperreflective plaque involving the inner retina with mild adjacent intraretinal fluid but no subretinal fluid.

By the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) anatomic scheme, any inflammatory lesion whose primary site is the retina or choroid is classified as posterior uveitis, irrespective of the presence or absence of vitreous cells or haze.\n\nB. Absence of vitreous inflammation excludes posterior uveitis and mandates classification as anterior uveitis if the anterior chamber is quiet.\n\nC. The key discriminator for posterior uveitis is inflammation posterior to the posterior lens capsule; therefore, a focal retinitis without vitreous haze is intermediate uveitis.\n\nD. If the lesion does not involve the macula and visual acuity is $20/20$, the process cannot be posterior uveitis.\n\nE. A focal area of active retinal inflammation, evidenced by retinal whitening with corresponding late FA staining, qualifies as posterior uveitis even if there is no anterior or vitreous inflammation, provided the primary site is retinal.", "solution": "The anatomic classification of uveitis is fundamentally determined by the primary intraocular site of inflammation, as codified by the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) working group. The core definitions are as follows: anterior uveitis indicates primary inflammation of the iris and/or ciliary body; intermediate uveitis indicates primary inflammation of the vitreous (often with involvement of the pars plana and peripheral retina); posterior uveitis indicates primary inflammation of the retina or choroid; and panuveitis indicates inflammation primarily involving the anterior segment, vitreous, and posterior segment concurrently. These anatomic definitions are independent of severity, visual acuity, or the presence or absence of ancillary inflammatory signs in nonprimary sites. Therefore, a lesion with the primary site in the retina or choroid is posterior uveitis, even if the vitreous is optically quiet.\n\nIn the presented case, the clinical and imaging findings localize the active inflammatory process to the retina: a discrete focus of retinal whitening, inner retinal hyperreflectivity on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), and early hypofluorescence with late staining on Fluorescein Angiography (FA), all without evidence of primary vitreous inflammation. This places the primary site of inflammation in the retina and thus falls under the definition of posterior uveitis. The absence of vitreous cells or haze does not negate this classification because intermediate uveitis requires the vitreous to be the primary site of inflammation, which is not the case here. Similarly, visual acuity and macular involvement do not determine anatomic class.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This statement directly reflects the SUN anatomic principle: posterior uveitis is defined by the primary site being retina or choroid, and the presence or absence of vitreous inflammation does not alter the anatomic class if the retina or choroid is the primary site. This is consistent with first principles of anatomic classification. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. This asserts that the absence of vitreous inflammation excludes posterior uveitis and forces an anterior classification if the anterior chamber is quiet. This contradicts the core definition because classification is not based on the presence or absence of vitreous inflammation, but on where the primary pathology resides. In this case, the retina is the primary site; therefore, it is posterior uveitis regardless of vitreous status. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. This claims that a focal retinitis without vitreous haze is intermediate uveitis, using an incorrect discriminator. Intermediate uveitis requires the vitreous to be the primary site of inflammation, not simply any posterior segment location. A retinal lesion without vitreous inflammation is still posterior uveitis if the retina is the primary site. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. This posits that normal visual acuity and lack of macular involvement exclude posterior uveitis. Anatomic classification does not depend on visual acuity or macular involvement; these factors are related to severity and functional impact, not location of inflammation. A peripheral retinal lesion with preserved acuity can still be posterior uveitis. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. This statement correctly identifies that a focal area of active retinal inflammation, corroborated by FA and OCT, qualifies as posterior uveitis if the retina is the primary site, independent of anterior or vitreous inflammation. This is concordant with anatomic first principles. Verdict — Correct.\n\nThus, the correct choices are A and E, because they align with the fundamental, site-based anatomic definitions of uveitis and properly classify an isolated focal retinitis without vitritis as posterior uveitis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "4661198"}, {"introduction": "Beyond classification, quantifying inflammation is critical for assessing severity and monitoring treatment response.

The solution involves three steps: normalizing all cell counts to a standard area, calculating the average of these normalized counts, and mapping the resulting average to the corresponding SUN grade.\n\n**Step 1: Normalization of Raw Cell Counts**\nThe standard for SUN grading is the cell count per a standardized field of size $1 \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, which corresponds to a reference area of $A_{ref} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$. The problem states that counts from fields of other sizes must be normalized by dividing the raw count by the area factor, which is the ratio of the actual examined area to the reference area.\n\nTwo sets of measurements were performed.\n\nThe first set involved $N_1 = 4$ fields, each measured with a beam of size $2 \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.

To normalize these counts to the standard $1 \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ equivalent, each count is divided by the area factor of $2$:\n- Normalized count 1: $\\frac{24}{2} = 12$\n- Normalized count 2: $\\frac{30}{2} = 15$\n- Normalized count 3: $\\frac{40}{2} = 20$\n- Normalized count 4: $\\frac{20}{2} = 10$\nThe set of normalized counts from this first group is $\\{12, 15, 20, 10\\}$.\n\nThe second set involved $N_2 = 3$ fields, each measured with the standard beam size of $1 \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The area for these measurements is $A_2 = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$.

Since the area factor is $1$, the normalized counts are identical to the raw counts. The set of normalized counts from this second group is $\\{14, 18, 16\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Computation of the Average Normalized Count**\nTo find the overall average cell count $\\bar{n}$, we compute the arithmetic mean of all $N = N_1 + N_2 = 4 + 3 = 7$ normalized counts. The complete set of normalized counts is $\\{12, 15, 20, 10, 14, 18, 16\\}$.\n$$ \\bar{n} = \\frac{12 + 15 + 20 + 10 + 14 + 18 + 16}{7} $$\nThe sum of the counts is:\n$$ \\text{Sum} = 105 $$\nThe average normalized count is:\n$$ \\bar{n} = \\frac{105}{7} = 15 $$\n\n**Step 3: Mapping the Average Count to the SUN Grade**\nThe final step is to classify the average count $\\bar{n} = 15$ using the SUN grading scale provided:\n- Grade $0$ if $n < 1$\n- Grade $0.5$ if $1 \\leq n \\leq 5$\n- Grade $1$ if $6 \\leq n \\leq 15$\n- Grade $2$ if $16 \\leq n \\leq 25$\n- Grade $3$ if $26 \\leq n \\leq 50$\n- Grade $4$ if $n > 50$\n\nThe calculated average count $\\bar{n} = 15$ falls within the range defined for Grade $1$, which is $6 \\leq n \\leq 15$.

The use of AC cell and vitreous haze grading, pharmacologic agents (corticosteroids, cycloplegics), and temporal descriptions of disease activity are standard clinical practice. The Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group is a recognized international body that has established authoritative guidelines for the classification of uveitis. The clinical scenario is realistic.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides specific, quantitative data (e.g., duration of quiescent period is $4$ months, duration of treated episode is $6$ weeks) and asks for a classification based on a well-defined, existing framework (SUN criteria). This structure allows for a unique and meaningful solution.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is described using objective clinical metrics and terminology. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\nThe problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically sound, and well-posed. No flaws are identified.\n\n### Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived based on the provided information and the established SUN criteria.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group provides specific definitions to classify the course of uveitis. The key definitions relevant to this problem are:\n\n1.  **Onset:**\n    -   *Sudden:* An onset that is symptomatic to the patient.\n    -   *Insidious:* An onset that is asymptomatic and identified only on examination.\n2.  **Duration:**\n    -   *Limited:* An episode of uveitis with a duration of less than or equal to $3$ months.\n    -   *Persistent:* An episode of uveitis with a duration greater than $3$ months.\n3.  **Course of Disease:**\n    -   *Acute:* An episode characterized by sudden onset and limited duration.\n    -   *Recurrent:* Repeated episodes of uveitis separated by periods of inactivity without treatment of $\\geq 3$ months in duration.\n    -   *Chronic:* Persistent uveitis, or uveitis that relapses in $< 3$ months after discontinuing treatment.\n\nNow, we apply these formal definitions to the patient's clinical course as described in the problem statement.\n\n-   **Onset:** The problem states \"sudden symptomatic onset.\" This meets the SUN definition of a **sudden** onset.\n-   **Duration:** Each inflammatory episode resolves by week $6$. Since $6$ weeks is approximately $1.5$ months, and $1.5 < 3$, the duration of each episode is **limited**.\n-   **Classification of an individual episode:** An episode with a sudden onset and limited duration is defined as **acute**. Therefore, each of the patient's three episodes is an acute episode of uveitis.\n-   **Course of Disease:** The problem asks for the classification of the overall disease course, not a single episode. The patient experiences three such episodes. The period between episodes is characterized by quiescence (grade $0$ cells) for an uninterrupted period of $4$ months, during which the patient is off all anti-inflammatory treatment.\n    -   The SUN definition for **recurrent** uveitis is \"repeated episodes separated by periods of inactivity without treatment of $\\geq 3$ months in duration.\"\n    -   The patient has \"repeated episodes\" ($3$ of them).\n    -   These episodes are separated by periods of inactivity (\"quiescent\").\n    -   The duration of this inactivity without treatment is $4$ months.\n    -   Since $4$ months $\\geq 3$ months, the patient's clinical course precisely matches the definition of recurrent uveitis.\n\nLet's also evaluate why the course is not chronic.\n-   The SUN definition for **chronic** uveitis is either persistent disease (duration $> 3$ months) or relapse occurring in $< 3$ months after stopping therapy.\n-   The patient's episodes are not persistent; they last only $6$ weeks.\n-   The relapses do not occur within $< 3$ months of stopping therapy. Instead, they occur after a $4$-month treatment-free interval. Thus, the condition is not chronic.\n\nBased on this step-by-step application of the SUN criteria, the most appropriate designation for the course of disease is **recurrent uveitis**.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Acute uveitis**\nThis option describes the nature of each individual inflammatory episode (sudden onset, limited duration). However, the question asks for the designation of the overall *course of disease*, which involves multiple episodes over time. Describing the entire disease pattern simply as \"acute uveitis\" is incomplete as it fails to capture the repeating nature of the events. Therefore, this option is not the *most* appropriate designation for the course.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. Recurrent uveitis**\nThis option is defined by repeated episodes separated by treatment-free periods of inactivity lasting $\\geq 3$ months. The patient experiences exactly this pattern: multiple acute episodes, each followed by a $4$-month period of quiescence without treatment. Since $4 \\geq 3$, this designation is perfectly aligned with the SUN Working Group's definition and accurately describes the patient's disease course.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Chronic uveitis**\nThis option is defined as persistent uveitis (duration $> 3$ months) or uveitis that relapses within $< 3$ months of discontinuing therapy. The patient's episodes last only $6$ weeks, which is not persistent. The relapses occur after a $4$-month treatment-free interval, which is not within the $< 3$ month timeframe required for this classification. Therefore, this designation is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Relapsing chronic uveitis (relapse within $<3$ months after stopping therapy)**\nThis option is a more detailed description of one type of chronic uveitis, as indicated by the parenthetical definition. This definition requires relapse to occur within $< 3$ months after stopping therapy. The patient's relapses occur after a $4$-month quiescent period. This directly contradicts the patient's clinical course.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4661273"}]}
