The patient has oligoarticular JIA with age at onset $4$ years and is Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) positive. In early-onset oligoarticular JIA, ANA positivity is a dominant risk factor for chronic anterior uveitis, whereas Human Leukocyte Antigen B27 (HLA-B27) is more strongly associated with acute anterior uveitis in enthesitis-related arthritis rather than the oligoarticular subtype. Suppose the baseline probability of uveitis in early-onset oligoarticular JIA with ANA negativity is $p_{0} = 0.20$. A well-tested epidemiologic fact is that the Odds Ratio (OR) quantifies multiplicative change in odds for an exposure, defined as the ratio of odds among the exposed to odds among the unexposed, and that under a multiplicative odds model the post-exposure odds equal the product of the baseline odds and the odds ratio. The ANA positivity in this setting has an odds ratio of $\\mathrm{OR} = 2.5$ relative to ANA negativity.

The derivation begins with the fundamental definitions.\n\nThe odds of an event occurring is defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring. For an event with probability $p$, the odds, $O$, are given by:\n$$O = \\frac{p}{1 - p}$$\nThe baseline group (unexposed, ANA negative) has a probability of uveitis $p_{0}$. The corresponding baseline odds, $O_{0}$, are:\n$$O_{0} = \\frac{p_{0}}{1 - p_{0}}$$\nThe exposed group (ANA positive) has a probability of uveitis $p_{1}$. The corresponding post-exposure odds, $O_{1}$, are:\n$$O_{1} = \\frac{p_{1}}{1 - p_{1}}$$\nThe Odds Ratio ($\\mathrm{OR}$) is defined as the ratio of the odds in the exposed group to the odds in the unexposed group:\n$$\\mathrm{OR} = \\frac{O_{1}}{O_{0}}$$\nThe problem states that a multiplicative odds model applies, which is consistent with this definition. Thus, the post-exposure odds can be calculated as:\n$$O_{1} = O_{0} \\times \\mathrm{OR}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $O_{0}$ into this equation gives:\n$$O_{1} = \\left(\\frac{p_{0}}{1 - p_{0}}\\right) \\times \\mathrm{OR}$$\nTo find the post-exposure probability $p_{1}$, we must solve the equation $O_{1} = p_{1} / (1 - p_{1})$ for $p_{1}$.\n$$O_{1} (1 - p_{1}) = p_{1}$$\n$$O_{1} - O_{1} p_{1} = p_{1}$$\n$$O_{1} = p_{1} + O_{1} p_{1}$$\n$$O_{1} = p_{1} (1 + O_{1})$$\n$$p_{1} = \\frac{O_{1}}{1 + O_{1}}$$\nThis is the general formula to convert odds back to probability.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $O_{1}$ in terms of $p_{0}$ and $\\mathrm{OR}$ yields the derived formula for the post-exposure probability:\n$$p_{1} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{p_{0}}{1 - p_{0}}\\right) \\times \\mathrm{OR}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{p_{0}}{1 - p_{0}}\\right) \\times \\mathrm{OR}}$$\nThis completes the derivation part of the task.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value. The given parameters are $p_{0} = 0.20$ and $\\mathrm{OR} = 2.5$.\nFirst, calculate the baseline odds, $O_{0}$:\n$$O_{0} = \\frac{0.20}{1 - 0.20} = \\frac{0.20}{0.80} = 0.25$$\nNext, calculate the post-exposure odds, $O_{1}$, using the multiplicative model:\n$$O_{1} = O_{0} \\times \\mathrm{OR} = 0.25 \\times 2.5 = 0.625$$\nFinally, convert the post-exposure odds $O_{1}$ back to the post-exposure probability $p_{1}$:\n$$p_{1} = \\frac{O_{1}}{1 + O_{1}} = \\frac{0.625}{1 + 0.625} = \\frac{0.625}{1.625}$$\nTo compute the final value:\n$$p_{1} = \\frac{625}{1625} = \\frac{25 \\times 25}{65 \\times 25} = \\frac{25}{65} = \\frac{5 \\times 5}{13 \\times 5} = \\frac{5}{13}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $5 \\div 13 \\approx 0.38461538...$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe first four significant figures are $3$, $8$, $4$, and $6$. The fifth significant figure is $1$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\nThe resulting numerical value for the post-exposure probability is $0.3846$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3846}$$", "id": "4681353"}, {"introduction": "Designing an effective screening program requires balancing the benefits of early detection against the costs and resources involved.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information (prevalence, sensitivity, independence of trials) to calculate an expected value. The terminology is precise and objective. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific or mathematical principles. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\n\nLet us formally define the given parameters. The prevalence, $P_{uveitis}$, is the prior probability that a randomly selected patient from the defined subgroup has active anterior uveitis.\n$$ P_{uveitis} = \\Pr(\\text{Disease}) = 0.15 $$\nThe sensitivity, $S_n$, is the conditional probability that the slit-lamp examination yields a positive result, given that the patient has the disease.\n$$ S_n = \\Pr(\\text{Test Positive} | \\text{Disease}) = 0.90 $$\n\nThe problem requires us to find the expected number of screenings to obtain one \"true detection.\" A true detection is a true positive event, which occurs when a patient both has the disease and is correctly identified by the test. We need to calculate the probability of this joint event for a single patient screening. Let this probability be $p_{TP}$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$ \\Pr(\\text{Test Positive} | \\text{Disease}) = \\frac{\\Pr(\\text{Test Positive} \\cap \\text{Disease})}{\\Pr(\\text{Disease})} $$\nRearranging this expression allows us to find the probability of the joint event (the true positive):\n$$ \\Pr(\\text{Test Positive} \\cap \\text{Disease}) = \\Pr(\\text{Disease}) \\times \\Pr(\\text{Test Positive} | \\text{Disease}) $$\nSubstituting our defined symbols:\n$$ p_{TP} = P_{uveitis} \\times S_n $$\n\nEach patient screening is an independent trial, which can be modeled as a Bernoulli trial. A \"success\" for this trial is defined as obtaining a true positive result. The probability of success in any single trial is $p_{TP}$.\nWe are interested in the expected number of such trials required to achieve the first success. This is a classic problem described by the geometric distribution. If a random variable $N$ represents the number of trials needed to get the first success in a series of independent Bernoulli trials with success probability $p$, then the expected value of $N$ is given by:\n$$ E[N] = \\frac{1}{p} $$\n\nIn our context, the number of patients to be screened is the number of trials, and the probability of success is $p_{TP}$.

The anterior uvea exhibits infiltration of activated T lymphocytes and monocytes that secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-$\\alpha$ (TNF-$\\alpha$), interferon-$\\gamma$ (IFN-$\\gamma$), interleukin-$17$ (IL-$17$), and interleukin-$6$ (IL-$6$). Sustained cytokine signaling promotes breakdown of the blood–ocular barriers, recruitment of additional effector cells, and perpetuation of intraocular inflammation.\n\nMethotrexate’s mechanism can be derived from core biochemical pathways:\n\n1. Folate cycle and nucleotide synthesis. Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR) catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, which donates one-carbon units needed for thymidylate and purine synthesis. By competitively inhibiting DHFR, methotrexate decreases intracellular tetrahydrofolate pools, thereby impairing de novo synthesis of thymidylate and purines. This limits the capacity for DNA replication and RNA transcription, preferentially affecting rapidly proliferating lymphocytes. The result is reduced clonal expansion of autoreactive T cells in uveal tissue, blunting the cellular immune response that drives uveitis.\n\n2. Adenosine pathway and immunomodulation. At low-to-moderate anti-inflammatory doses, methotrexate inhibits 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) transformylase, leading to accumulation of AICAR and downstream inhibition of adenosine deaminase. This elevates intracellular and extracellular adenosine. Extracellular adenosine engages $A_{2A}$ and $A_{2B}$ G protein–coupled receptors on immune cells, which activates adenylate cyclase, increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate, and suppresses nuclear factor-$\\kappa$B (NF-$\\kappa$B)–dependent transcription of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-$\\alpha$, IFN-$\\gamma$, IL-$17$, and IL-$6$. In the eye, this adenosine-mediated signaling reduces leukocyte adhesion, chemotaxis, and effector function, complementing the antiproliferative effect to diminish uveal inflammation.\n\nTogether, these mechanisms explain how methotrexate reduces ocular inflammation in HLA-B27–associated JIA uveitis by limiting lymphocyte proliferation through folate antagonism and dampening cytokine production through adenosine signaling.\n\nWe now compute the dose normalized to Body Surface Area (BSA) in $\\mathrm{mg/m^2}$ from a weight-based weekly regimen.
