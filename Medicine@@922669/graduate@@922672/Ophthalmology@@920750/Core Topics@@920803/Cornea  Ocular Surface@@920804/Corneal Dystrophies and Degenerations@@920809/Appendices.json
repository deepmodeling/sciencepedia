There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nLet $D$ denote the pathogenic allele for Schnyder corneal lipid dystrophy, with frequency $p$. Let $d$ denote the normal allele, with frequency $q = 1-p$. The population is assumed to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The frequencies of the three possible genotypes in the population are:\n- Frequency of homozygous dominant ($DD$): $P(DD) = p^2$\n- Frequency of heterozygous ($Dd$): $P(Dd) = 2pq = 2p(1-p)$\n- Frequency of homozygous recessive ($dd$): $P(dd) = q^2 = (1-p)^2$\n\nGiven that the disease is autosomal dominant with full penetrance, individuals with genotypes $DD$ or $Dd$ are affected, while individuals with genotype $dd$ are unaffected. The total frequency of affected individuals in the population, $P(\\text{Affected})$, is the sum of the frequencies of the affected genotypes:\n$$P(\\text{Affected}) = P(DD) + P(Dd) = p^2 + 2p(1-p) = p^2 + 2p - 2p^2 = 2p - p^2 = p(2-p)$$\n\nThe first parent is an affected individual drawn at random from this population. We must find the probability of this parent's genotype being $DD$ or $Dd$, conditional on them being affected. Using the definition of conditional probability, $P(A|B) = P(A \\cap B) / P(B)$:\nThe probability that the affected parent is homozygous dominant ($DD$) is:\n$$P(\\text{Parent is } DD | \\text{Affected}) = \\frac{P(DD \\text{ and Affected})}{P(\\text{Affected})} = \\frac{P(DD)}{P(\\text{Affected})} = \\frac{p^2}{p(2-p)} = \\frac{p}{2-p}$$\nThe probability that the affected parent is heterozygous ($Dd$) is:\n$$P(\\text{Parent is } Dd | \\text{Affected}) = \\frac{P(Dd \\text{ and Affected})}{P(\\text{Affected})} = \\frac{P(Dd)}{P(\\text{Affected})} = \\frac{2p(1-p)}{p(2-p)} = \\frac{2(1-p)}{2-p}$$\nNote that these probabilities correctly sum to $1$: $\\frac{p}{2-p} + \\frac{2(1-p)}{2-p} = \\frac{p+2-2p}{2-p} = \\frac{2-p}{2-p} = 1$.\n\nThe second parent is clinically unaffected and confirmed to be a non-carrier. This means their genotype is definitively $dd$.\n\nA child of these two parents will be affected if the child's genotype is $Dd$. The child cannot have genotype $DD$, because the second parent ($dd$) can only pass on a $d$ allele. Thus, the child is affected if and only if they inherit a $D$ allele from the first (affected) parent.\n\nLet $A_{child}$ be the event that the child is affected. We calculate the probability of this event using the law of total probability, conditioned on the genotype of the affected parent:\n$$P(A_{child}) = P(\\text{Child gets } D \\text{ from Parent 1})$$\n$$P(A_{child}) = P(\\text{Child gets } D | \\text{Parent is } DD)P(\\text{Parent is } DD | \\text{Affected}) + P(\\text{Child gets } D | \\text{Parent is } Dd)P(\\text{Parent is } Dd | \\text{Affected})$$\n\nFrom the principles of Mendelian segregation:\n- The probability of a $DD$ parent passing on a $D$ allele is $1$.\n- The probability of a $Dd$ parent passing on a $D$ allele is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting these probabilities into the equation:\n$$P(A_{child}) = (1) \\left(\\frac{p}{2-p}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{2(1-p)}{2-p}\\right)$$\n$$P(A_{child}) = \\frac{p}{2-p} + \\frac{1-p}{2-p}$$\n$$P(A_{child}) = \\frac{p + 1 - p}{2-p} = \\frac{1}{2-p}$$\n\nThis is the exact analytical expression for the probability that the child will be affected.\n\nThe problem requires us to evaluate this probability for $p = 1 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n$$p = 0.00001$$\nSubstituting this value into the derived expression:\n$$P(A_{child}) = \\frac{1}{2 - 0.00001} = \\frac{1}{1.99999}$$\n\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division and round to $6$ significant figures:\n$$\\frac{1}{1.99999} \\approx 0.5000025000125...$$\nThe first $6$ significant figures are $5$, $0$, $0$, $0$, $0$, $2$.

The fluence $F(z)$ at a depth $z$ into the tissue is given by:\n$$ F(z) = F \\exp(-\\alpha z) $$\nHere, $F$ is the incident fluence at the surface ($z=0$), and $\\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient of the tissue. Ablation occurs in the region where the local fluence $F(z)$ is greater than the material's ablation threshold fluence, $F_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The depth of ablation for a single pulse, $d_{\\mathrm{pulse}}$, is the depth $z$ at which the fluence attenuates to exactly the threshold value.\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{th}} = F \\exp(-\\alpha d_{\\mathrm{pulse}}) $$\nWe can solve this equation for $d_{\\mathrm{pulse}}$:\n$$ \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{th}}}{F} = \\exp(-\\alpha d_{\\mathrm{pulse}}) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{F_{\\mathrm{th}}}{F}\\right) = -\\alpha d_{\\mathrm{pulse}} $$\n$$ d_{\\mathrm{pulse}} = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln\\left(\\frac{F_{\\mathrm{th}}}{F}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln\\left(\\frac{F}{F_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right) $$\nThis is the well-known formula for single-pulse ablation depth. The total ablation depth, $\\Delta$, after $N$ identical pulses is the sum of the depths from each pulse, assuming the ablation characteristics do not change with depth.\n$$ \\Delta = N \\times d_{\\mathrm{pulse}} = N \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln\\left(\\frac{F}{F_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right) $$\nOur goal is to find the required per-pulse fluence $F$.
