The calculation is based on the fundamental relationship between mass, concentration, and volume.\n\nThe cumulative daily exposure is the product of the solution's concentration and the total volume of the solution administered per day.\nLet $C$ be the concentration of BAK in the solution, $V_{drop}$ be the volume of a single drop, and $N$ be the number of instillations per day.\n\nFirst, we must determine the concentration $C$ in units that are convenient for calculation, specifically $\\mathrm{mg/mL}$. The labeled concentration is given as $0.01\\%$ weight by volume ($\\mathrm{w/v}$). The problem states that $1\\%~\\mathrm{w/v}$ corresponds to $1~\\mathrm{g}$ of solute per $100~\\mathrm{mL}$ of solution.\nTherefore, a concentration of $0.01\\%~\\mathrm{w/v}$ is equivalent to:\n$$ C = 0.01 \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{100~\\mathrm{mL}} $$\nTo convert this to $\\mathrm{mg/mL}$, we use the conversion factor $1~\\mathrm{g} = 1000~\\mathrm{mg}$:\n$$ C = \\frac{0.01~\\mathrm{g}}{100~\\mathrm{mL}} \\times \\frac{1000~\\mathrm{mg}}{1~\\mathrm{g}} = \\frac{10~\\mathrm{mg}}{100~\\mathrm{mL}} = 0.1~\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{mL}} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the total volume of the solution administered per day, $V_{daily}$.

A key tool in this process is the Likelihood Ratio, which measures how much a given test result or clinical sign should increase or decrease our confidence in a diagnosis [@problem_id:4650972]. This exercise demonstrates how to calculate the positive Likelihood Ratio for a follicular reaction in suspected toxic conjunctivitis, providing a quantitative measure of the sign's diagnostic weight, independent of the disease's prevalence.", "problem": "A $68$-year-old patient with primary open-angle glaucoma has been using a preserved topical $\\beta$-blocker twice daily for $6$ months. The preservative is benzalkonium chloride, and the patient develops burning, foreign-body sensation, and mild conjunctival hyperemia.

Consider the presence of a follicular reaction as an index sign for toxic conjunctivitis in the context of exposure to preserved glaucoma drops, and suppose that for this sign the sensitivity is $0.60$ and the specificity is $0.70$ for toxic conjunctivitis (relative to other causes of conjunctivitis in similar patients).\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of diagnostic test characteristics and without assuming any prevalence, derive the expression for the positive Likelihood Ratio (Likelihood Ratio, abbreviated as LR) of the follicular reaction for toxic conjunctivitis, and compute its value from the given sensitivity and specificity.
