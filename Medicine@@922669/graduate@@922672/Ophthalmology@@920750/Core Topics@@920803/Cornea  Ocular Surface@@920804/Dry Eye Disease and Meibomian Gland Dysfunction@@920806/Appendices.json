It is a scientifically sound, well-posed problem in biophysical fluid dynamics. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**2. Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe flow is described as steady, incompressible, and fully developed within a straight cylindrical tube. The governing equation is the steady-state, incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, which simplifies under these conditions. We use a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, z)$, with the $z$-axis aligned with the duct's central axis.\n\nThe velocity vector is given by $\\mathbf{u} = u_r \\mathbf{\\hat{r}} + u_\\theta \\mathbf{\\hat{\\theta}} + u_z \\mathbf{\\hat{z}}$.\nThe assumptions lead to significant simplifications:\n1.  **Steady flow:** $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  **Axisymmetric flow:** $u_\\theta = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$ for all quantities.\n3.  **Fully developed flow:** The velocity profile is constant along the duct, so $\\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial z} = 0$.\n\nThe continuity equation for an incompressible fluid in cylindrical coordinates is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial(r u_r)}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\nApplying the assumptions of axisymmetric and fully-developed flow, this reduces to $\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial(r u_r)}{\\partial r} = 0$. Integrating gives $r u_r = \\mathrm{constant}$. Since the velocity $u_r$ must be finite at the centerline ($r=0$), the constant must be zero, which implies $u_r=0$ everywhere.\nThus, the only non-zero velocity component is $u_z$, and it is only a function of the radial position, $u_z(r)$. The velocity vector is $\\mathbf{u} = u_z(r) \\mathbf{\\hat{z}}$.\n\nThe steady-state Navier-Stokes equation is:\n$$ \\rho (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla P + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} $$\nThe advection term, $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbfu$, is zero because $u_r=u_\\theta=0$ and $u_z$ does not depend on $z$. The equation simplifies to $\\nabla P = \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$.\n\nWe consider the components of this vector equation:\n-   $r$-component: $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial r} = 0$. Pressure does not vary with radial position.\n-   $\\theta$-component: $\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$. Pressure does not vary with azimuthal angle.\n-   $z$-component: $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} = \\eta \\left( \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r\\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial r}\\right) \\right)$.\n\nSince $P$ depends only on $z$ and $u_z$ depends only on $r$, both sides of the $z$-component equation must be equal to a constant. The pressure gradient $\\frac{dP}{dz}$ is constant along the duct. For a pressure drop $\\Delta P$ over a length $L$, we can write this constant as $\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$. The negative sign indicates that pressure decreases in the direction of positive flow.\nThe equation for the velocity profile becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{d u_z}{dr}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\eta} \\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{\\eta L} $$\nIntegrating once with respect to $r$:\n$$ r\\frac{d u_z}{dr} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta L} r^2 + C_1 $$\nDividing by $r$:\n$$ \\frac{d u_z}{dr} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta L} r + \\frac{C_1}{r} $$\nFor the velocity gradient to be finite at the center of the duct ($r=0$), the constant $C_1$ must be zero.\nIntegrating a second time:\n$$ u_z(r) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L} r^2 + C_2 $$\nWe apply the no-slip boundary condition at the duct wall: $u_z(R) = 0$.\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L} R^2 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{\\Delta P R^2}{4\\eta L} $$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back gives the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$ u_z(r) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L} (R^2 - r^2) $$\n\nNow, we derive the pressure–flow relationship. The volumetric flow rate $Q$ is the integral of the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area $A$ of the duct.\n$$ Q = \\int_A u_z(r)dA = \\int_0^R u_z(r) (2\\pi r dr) $$\n$$ Q = \\int_0^R \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L} (R^2 - r^2) (2\\pi r) dr $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{2\\pi \\Delta P}{4\\eta L} \\int_0^R (R^2 r - r^3) dr = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\eta L} \\left[ \\frac{R^2 r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_0^R $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\eta L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\eta L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) $$\nThis yields the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, which is the required pressure–flow relationship:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi R^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L} $$\nTo calculate the pressure drop $\\Delta P$, we rearrange this equation:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{8 \\eta L Q}{\\pi R^4} $$\n\nNext, we substitute the given values, ensuring all are in base SI units.\n-   $\\eta = 50\\,\\mathrm{mPa \\cdot s} = 50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$\n-   $L = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $R = 30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 30 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $Q = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L/min} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{L/min}$.

The final reported answer is only the summed meiboscore.\n\n**Part 1: Combined Gland Area Loss**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total tarsal plate area, $A_{total}$, by summing the areas of the upper and lower lids.\n$$A_{total} = A_{U} + A_{L} = 275\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2} + 150\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2} = 425\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total measured meibomian gland area, $G_{total}$, across both lids.\n$$G_{total} = G_{U} + G_{L} = 128\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2} + 63\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2} = 191\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$$\n\nThe combined gland area loss, $Loss_{total}$, is the difference between the total tarsal plate area and the total gland area.\n$$Loss_{total} = A_{total} - G_{total} = 425\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2} - 191\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2} = 234\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$$\n\nThe problem asks for this loss to be expressed as a fraction of the combined tarsal plate area. Let this fraction be $F_{loss}$.\n$$F_{loss} = \\frac{Loss_{total}}{A_{total}} = \\frac{234}{425}$$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal and rounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$F_{loss} \\approx 0.5505882... \\approx 0.5506$$\n\n**Part 2: Summed Meiboscore**\n\nTo determine the summed meiboscore, we must first calculate the meiboscore for each lid individually. The score is based on the fractional gland area loss, $L$, within that specific lid. The formula for $L$ for a single lid is $L = \\frac{A_{lid} - G_{lid}}{A_{lid}}$.\n\n**Upper-Lid Meiboscore:**\nThe fractional loss for the upper lid, $L_U$, is:\n$$L_{U} = \\frac{A_{U} - G_{U}}{A_{U}} = \\frac{275 - 128}{275} = \\frac{147}{275}$$\nTo classify this value according to the meiboscore scale, we compare it to the thresholds $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n$$L_{U} \\approx 0.5345$$\nThe thresholds are:\n$$\\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.3333$$\n$$\\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.6667$$\nSince $\\frac{1}{3} \\leq 0.5345 \\leq \\frac{2}{3}$, the fractional loss $L_U$ falls into the Grade $2$ category.\nThus, the upper-lid meiboscore is $2$.\n\n**Lower-Lid Meiboscore:**\nThe fractional loss for the lower lid, $L_L$, is:\n$$L_{L} = \\frac{A_{L} - G_{L}}{A_{L}} = \\frac{150 - 63}{150} = \\frac{87}{150} = \\frac{29}{50}$$\nConverting to a decimal:\n$$L_{L} = 0.58$$\nComparing this to the thresholds:\nSince $\\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.3333 \\leq 0.58 \\leq \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.6667$, the fractional loss $L_L$ also falls into the Grade $2$ category.\nThus, the lower-lid meiboscore is $2$.\n\n**Summed Meiboscore:**\nThe final step is to compute the summed meiboscore, which is the sum of the individual lid grades.\n$$Summed \\, Meiboscore = \\text{Upper-Lid Grade} + \\text{Lower-Lid Grade} = 2 + 2 = 4$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "4670173"}, {"introduction": "A primary consequence of MGD and resultant evaporative dry eye is an increase in tear film osmolarity, which drives ocular surface inflammation and patient symptoms.
