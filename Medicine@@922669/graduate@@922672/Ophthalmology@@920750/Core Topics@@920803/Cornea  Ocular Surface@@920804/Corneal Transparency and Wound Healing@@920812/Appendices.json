The assumptions of constant migration velocity and negligible cell division (mitosis) are standard for modeling the initial phase of healing for certain wound sizes. The given values for defect size and migration speed are within realistic biological ranges. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear initial state (initial diameter), a constant rate of change (migration speed), and a defined final state (complete closure), allowing for the calculation of a unique time interval.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms. There is a minor linguistic ambiguity in the phrase \"migrates tangentially with an approximately constant speed in the local normal direction.\" Physically, for a circular defect to close, the boundary must move radially inward, which is normal to the circular edge. The word \"tangentially\" is likely extraneous or used in a specific biological context not relevant to the kinematics, while \"in the local normal direction\" correctly specifies the direction of the velocity vector of the closing edge. This ambiguity does not invalidate the problem, as the physical mechanism is clear from the context and the explicit directional information.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem that can be solved using first principles of kinematics. The minor linguistic ambiguity is resolved by physical reasoning.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for the time required for a circular epithelial defect to close completely. The closure is driven by the migration of the leading edge of the epithelium.\n\nLet $R(t)$ be the radius of the circular defect at time $t$. The initial diameter is given as $D_0 = 3$ mm. The initial radius, $R_0$, is half of the initial diameter:\n$$R_0 = R(t=0) = \\frac{D_0}{2} = \\frac{3 \\text{ mm}}{2} = 1.5 \\text{ mm}$$\n\nThe problem states that the leading edge migrates with a constant speed, $v$, in the local normal direction. For a circular defect, the normal direction at any point on the edge is the radial direction. Since the defect is closing, the radius is decreasing. The speed $v$ is the magnitude of the rate of change of the radius. Therefore, we can write the relationship between the rate of change of the radius, $\\frac{dR}{dt}$, and the speed $v$ as:\n$$v = \\left| \\frac{dR}{dt} \\right|$$\nBecause the radius is decreasing, its derivative with respect to time must be negative. Thus, we have the following first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\\frac{dR}{dt} = -v$$\nwhere $v = 0.12$ mm/h is a constant.\n\nTo find the radius $R(t)$ as a function of time, we integrate this differential equation. We can separate variables and integrate from the initial time $t=0$ with radius $R_0$ to a general time $t$ with radius $R(t)$:\n$$\\int_{R_0}^{R(t)} dR' = \\int_{0}^{t} (-v) \\, dt'$$\nSolving the integrals gives:\n$$R(t) - R_0 = -v(t - 0)$$\n$$R(t) = R_0 - vt$$\nThis equation describes the radius of the defect at any time $t$ before closure is complete.\n\nComplete closure occurs when the radius of the defect becomes zero. Let $t_c$ be the time to complete closure. At this time, $R(t_c) = 0$. We can substitute this condition into our equation for $R(t)$:\n$$0 = R_0 - v t_c$$\nNow, we solve for the closure time $t_c$:\n$$v t_c = R_0$$\n$$t_c = \\frac{R_0}{v}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the time to closure from first principles.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into this expression. The initial radius is $R_0 = 1.5$ mm and the migration speed is $v = 0.12$ mm/h.\n$$t_c = \\frac{1.5 \\text{ mm}}{0.12 \\text{ mm/h}}$$\nThe units of mm cancel, leaving the time in hours, as required.\n$$t_c = \\frac{1.5}{0.12} \\text{ h} = \\frac{150}{12} \\text{ h} = \\frac{25}{2} \\text{ h}$$\n$$t_c = 12.5 \\text{ h}$$\nThe problem requests the answer rounded to $3$ significant figures.

The provided parameters and assumptions are standard for a first-order biophysical model of corneal hydration dynamics and are within a physiologically realistic range. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the conservation of mass for the two-phase mixture composing the corneal stroma: water and an incompressible solid matrix. The total volume of the corneal slab, $V(t)$, at any time $t$ is the sum of the volume of water, $V_w(t)$, and the volume of the solid matrix, $V_s(t)$.\n$$V(t) = V_w(t) + V_s(t)$$\nThe problem states that the stromal solids are incompressible and are not transported. This implies that the solid volume is constant over time:\n$$V_s(t) = V_s(0) = V_{s0}$$\nThe problem considers a planar slab of constant area $A$. The total volume at any time $t$ can thus be expressed in terms of its thickness $h(t)$:\n$$V(t) = A \\cdot h(t)$$\nThe rate of change of the total volume is given by the time derivative of this expression. Since $A$ is constant:\n$$\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} = A \\frac{dh(t)}{dt}$$\nTaking the time derivative of the first equation, we get:\n$$\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} = \\frac{dV_w(t)}{dt} + \\frac{dV_s(t)}{dt}$$\nSince the solid volume $V_s$ is constant, its time derivative is zero, $\\frac{dV_s(t)}{dt} = 0$. Therefore, the rate of change of the total volume is equal to the rate of change of the water volume:\n$$\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} = \\frac{dV_w(t)}{dt}$$\nThe problem states there is a spatially uniform, time-constant volumetric water efflux density $J_w$ across the area $A$. This efflux represents the rate of water volume removal from the stroma. The total rate of water volume change is therefore:\n$$\\frac{dV_w(t)}{dt} = -A \\cdot J_w$$\nThe negative sign indicates that water volume is decreasing.\n\nEquating the two expressions for $\\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$:\n$$A \\frac{dh(t)}{dt} = -A \\cdot J_w$$\nThe area $A$ cancels, yielding a simple differential equation for the corneal thickness:\n$$\\frac{dh(t)}{dt} = -J_w$$\nTo find the thickness $h(t)$ at time $t$, we integrate this equation from time $0$ to $t$, starting from the initial thickness $h(0) = h_0$.\n$$\\int_{h_0}^{h(t)} dh = \\int_{0}^{t} -J_w \\, d\\tau$$\nSince $J_w$ is constant:\n$$h(t) - h_0 = -J_w \\int_{0}^{t} d\\tau = -J_w t$$\nThe thinning of the cornea, $\\Delta h(t)$, is the reduction in thickness from the initial state, defined as $\\Delta h(t) = h_0 - h(t)$. Rearranging the previous equation gives:\n$$\\Delta h(t) = h_0 - h(t) = J_w t$$\nThis result shows that the total thinning is directly proportional to the efflux density and the elapsed time.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the given parameters.
