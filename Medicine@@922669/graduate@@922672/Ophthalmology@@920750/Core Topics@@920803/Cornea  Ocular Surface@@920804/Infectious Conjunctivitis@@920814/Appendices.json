Using only the fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prior probability, and conditional probability, derive an expression for the post-test probability that the patient truly has adenoviral conjunctivitis given a positive RAT result, and then compute its value. Round your final answer to four significant figures and express it as a unitless decimal.", "solution": "The task is to derive an expression for the post-test probability of a patient having adenoviral conjunctivitis given a positive rapid antigen test (RAT) result, and then to compute its numerical value. This post-test probability is also known as the positive predictive value (PPV). The derivation must be based on fundamental definitions.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has adenoviral conjunctivitis.\nLet $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have adenoviral conjunctivitis.\nLet $T$ be the event that the RAT result is positive.\nLet $T^c$ be the event that the RAT result is negative.\n\nThe information provided in the problem statement can be translated into probabilistic terms:\n1.  The pretest probability, or prevalence, is the probability of a patient having the disease before the test is performed: $P(D) = 0.30$.\n2.  The probability of a patient not having the disease is the complement: $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\n3.  The sensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease: $P(T|D) = 0.85$. This is the true positive rate.\n4.  The specificity is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease: $P(T^c|D^c) = 0.95$. This is the true negative rate.\n\nFrom the specificity, we can determine the probability of a positive test result given that the patient does not have the disease. This is the false positive rate, which is the complement of the specificity:\n$P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nThe quantity we need to find is the post-test probability of having the disease given a positive test result, which is the conditional probability $P(D|T)$.\n\nAccording to the fundamental definition of conditional probability, for any two events $A$ and $B$, $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$. Applying this to our problem:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(T)}$$\nwhere $P(D \\cap T)$ is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive, and $P(T)$ is the total probability of testing positive.\n\nWe must now express the numerator and the denominator in terms of the given quantities.\n\nFor the numerator, $P(D \\cap T)$:\nFrom the definition of conditional probability for $P(T|D)$, we have $P(T|D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(D)}$.\nRearranging this equation gives an expression for the joint probability:\n$$P(D \\cap T) = P(T|D)P(D)$$\nThese are the probabilities of true positives among the entire population.\n\nFor the denominator, $P(T)$:\nA positive test result can occur in two mutually exclusive ways:\n1.  The patient has the disease and tests positive (a true positive). The probability of this event is $P(D \\cap T)$.\n2.  The patient does not have the disease and tests positive (a false positive). The probability of this event is $P(D^c \\cap T)$.\n\nBy the law of total probability, $P(T)$ is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n$$P(T) = P(D \\cap T) + P(D^c \\cap T)$$\nWe already have an expression for $P(D \\cap T)$. We can derive a similar expression for $P(D^c \\cap T)$ by rearranging the definition of $P(T|D^c)$:\n$$P(D^c \\cap T) = P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(T)$:\n$$P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for the numerator and denominator back into the formula for $P(D|T)$:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the post-test probability, which is an instance of Bayes' theorem.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value by substituting the given probabilities:\n$P(D) = 0.30$\n$P(D^c) = 0.70$\n$P(T|D) = 0.85$\n$P(T|D^c) = 0.05$\n\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{(0.85)(0.30)}{(0.85)(0.30) + (0.05)(0.70)}$$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\nNumerator: $P(D \\cap T) = 0.85 \\times 0.30 = 0.255$. This is the probability of a true positive result in the population.\nDenominator term 1: Same as the numerator, $0.255$.\nDenominator term 2: $P(D^c \\cap T) = 0.05 \\times 0.70 = 0.035$. This is the probability of a false positive result in the population.\n\nNow, substitute these back into the fraction:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{0.255}{0.255 + 0.035} = \\frac{0.255}{0.290}$$\n\nFinally, perform the division and round to four significant figures:\n$$P(D|T) = 0.8793103448...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.8793$.

The total volume of this mixed fluid, $V_{mix}$, is the sum of the two volumes:\n$$V_{mix} = T + V$$\nThe total amount of drug in the system is $D$, which was contained entirely within the eye drop. According to assumption (ii), no drug is lost to absorption during this instantaneous mixing phase. Therefore, the total mass of the drug $D$ is now distributed uniformly throughout the volume $V_{mix}$.\n\nThe concentration of the drug in this mixed fluid, $C_{mix}$, is defined as the total mass of the drug divided by the total volume of the mixture:\n$$C_{mix} = \\frac{D}{V_{mix}} = \\frac{D}{T+V}$$\nNext, according to assumption (iii), reflex mechanisms rapidly restore the tear film volume to its baseline value, $T$. This is achieved by the loss of excess fluid volume via overflow. The volume of fluid lost is $V_{loss} = V_{mix} - T = (T+V) - T = V$.\n\nA critical consequence of the uniform mixing assumption is that the fluid lost to overflow has the exact same concentration, $C_{mix}$, as the fluid that remains in the eye. Therefore, the concentration of the drug in the final, reduced volume $T$ is not changed by the overflow process.

Consider a closed, well-mixed community in which an adenoviral conjunctivitis outbreak begins. Assume the following biological and epidemiological foundations: individuals are either susceptible, infectious, or removed (recovered and immune for the time scale of the outbreak); the number of potentially infectious contacts per infectious person per unit time is proportional to a per-capita contact rate; transmission occurs with a fixed probability per contact; and recovery occurs at a constant per-capita rate.

The dynamics of these compartments are described by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).\n\n1.  **Rate of change of Susceptibles, $\\frac{dS}{dt}$**:\n    Susceptible individuals become infectious upon contact with an infectious individual. The problem describes a \"mass-action\" transmission model in a well-mixed population. The rate of contacts between an infectious person and any other person is $c$. The fraction of these contacts that are with susceptible individuals is $\\frac{S}{N}$. The probability of transmission per contact is $p$. Thus, a single infectious individual creates new infections at a rate of $c \\cdot p \\cdot \\frac{S}{N}$. With $I$ infectious individuals, the total rate of new infections is $I \\cdot c \\cdot p \\cdot \\frac{S}{N}$. The problem defines the transmission parameter as $\\beta = c p$.

The problem states that recovery occurs at a constant per-capita rate. The mean infectious duration is given as $D$. This corresponds to an exponential distribution for the infectious period, with a rate parameter $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{D}$. The total rate of recovery for the entire infectious population is $\\gamma I(t)$.\n    $$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = \\gamma I(t) $$\n\n3.  **Rate of change of Infectious, $\\frac{dI}{dt}$**:\n    The number of infectious individuals increases by the rate of new infections and decreases by the rate of recovery.\n    $$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = \\beta \\frac{S(t)I(t)}{N} - \\gamma I(t) $$\n\nThe complete SIR model is the system of these three ODEs:\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = -\\frac{\\beta SI}{N} $$\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = \\frac{\\beta SI}{N} - \\gamma I $$\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = \\gamma I $$\nAs a check, the sum of the rates is $\\frac{dS}{dt} + \\frac{dI}{dt} + \\frac{dR}{dt} = (-\\frac{\\beta SI}{N}) + (\\frac{\\beta SI}{N} - \\gamma I) + (\\gamma I) = 0$, confirming that the total population $N$ is conserved.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Peak Infectious Number, $I_{\\text{peak}}$\n\nThe peak of the epidemic, $I_{\\text{peak}}$, corresponds to the maximum value of $I(t)$.
