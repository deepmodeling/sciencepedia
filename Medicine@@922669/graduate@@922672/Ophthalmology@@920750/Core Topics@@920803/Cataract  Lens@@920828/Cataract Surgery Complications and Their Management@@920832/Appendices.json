It presents a standard dilution calculation problem set in a realistic clinical context, providing all necessary information to derive a unique solution based on fundamental principles.\n\nThe task is to derive the relationship for a dilution calculation and then to compute a specific volume. The derivation must start from two fundamental principles: the definition of concentration and the conservation of solute mass.\n\nLet us define the variables for the initial (stock) solution and the final (diluted) solution.\nFor the stock solution:\nLet $C_1$ be the concentration of the stock cefuroxime solution.\nLet $V_1$ be the volume of the stock solution that must be withdrawn.\nLet $m_1$ be the mass of the solute (cefuroxime) in the volume $V_1$.\n\nFor the final diluted solution:\nLet $C_2$ be the concentration of the final cefuroxime solution.\nLet $V_2$ be the total volume of the final solution.\nLet $m_2$ be the mass of the solute (cefuroxime) in the volume $V_2$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the given values are:\n$C_1 = 100$ mg/mL\n$C_2 = 10$ mg/mL\n$V_2 = 5$ mL\n\nThe first principle is the definition of concentration ($C$) as the mass of solute ($m$) per unit volume of solution ($V$):\n$$C = \\frac{m}{V}$$\nFrom this definition, the mass of the solute can be expressed as the product of its concentration and volume:\n$$m = C \\cdot V$$\nApplying this to our specific case, we can write expressions for the mass of cefuroxime in the stock volume to be used and in the final prepared volume:\n$$m_1 = C_1 V_1$$\n$$m_2 = C_2 V_2$$\n\nThe second principle is the conservation of solute mass during dilution. When the stock solution is diluted with a sterile diluent, the amount (mass) of the solute (cefuroxime) remains unchanged. The mass of cefuroxime taken from the stock solution is the same mass that is present in the final diluted solution. Therefore, we can state:\n$$m_1 = m_2$$\n\nBy substituting the expressions for $m_1$ and $m_2$ into the conservation of mass equation, we derive the required relationship:\n$$C_1 V_1 = C_2 V_2$$\nThis equation is the general formula for dilution calculations, derived as requested from first principles.\n\nThe problem asks for the volume of the stock solution, $V_1$, that must be withdrawn. We can rearrange the derived relationship to solve for $V_1$:\n$$V_1 = \\frac{C_2 V_2}{C_1}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this equation to calculate the volume $V_1$.\nThe values are:\n$C_1 = 100$ mg/mL\n$C_2 = 10$ mg/mL\n$V_2 = 5$ mL\n\nSubstituting these values yields:\n$$V_1 = \\frac{(10 \\text{ mg/mL}) \\cdot (5 \\text{ mL})}{100 \\text{ mg/mL}}$$\nThe units of mg/mL in the numerator and denominator cancel, leaving the result in mL, which is dimensionally correct for a volume.\n$$V_1 = \\frac{50}{100} \\text{ mL}$$\n$$V_1 = 0.5 \\text{ mL}$$\n\nThus, the volume of the $100$ mg/mL stock solution that must be withdrawn is $0.5$ mL. This volume would then be mixed with a sterile diluent (such as sterile water for injection or balanced salt solution) to a total final volume of $5$ mL to achieve the desired concentration of $10$ mg/mL.

The problem states that the retained volume of the Ophthalmic Viscoelastic Device (OVD), $V(t)$, follows a first-order clearance process. This is described by the linear first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} V(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\tau$ is the effective clearance time constant.

An IOP of $20.07$ mmHg at $3$ hours postoperatively is moderately elevated above the baseline of $14$ mmHg, but it generally does not represent an immediate threat to a healthy optic nerve. The peak pressure, according to the model, occurred at $t=0$, with a value of $P(0) = 14 + \\frac{100}{10} = 24$ mmHg. Since the pressure is already on a downward trend and is below the typical threshold for intervention (often considered to be in the range of $28-30$ mmHg or higher), the appropriate management strategy would be watchful waiting.\nThe cohesive nature of the OVD, while facilitating its removal during surgery, can cause a significant IOP spike if a bolus is retained, as it can physically obstruct the trabecular meshwork. The time constant $\\tau = 6$ hours encapsulates the net effect of the eye's natural aqueous outflow facility and the clearance of this obstruction. A lower outflow facility (e.g., in an eye with pre-existing glaucoma) would result in a larger $\\tau$, leading to a more prolonged and potentially more dangerous pressure elevation. In this specific case, with a healthy baseline IOP and a clearance half-life of $\\tau \\ln(2) \\approx 4.16$ hours, the pressure is expected to return to near-baseline levels within approximately $24$ hours (i.e., $4$ time constants).
