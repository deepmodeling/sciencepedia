The assumption of paraxial optics and the placement of refractive error at the corneal plane are standard simplifications that define a solvable model.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be furnished.\n\n### Solution Formulation\nThe core principle of imaging by an optical system is described by the vergence equation:\n$$L' = L + P$$\nwhere $L$ is the object vergence at the entrance to the system, $P$ is the power of the system, and $L'$ is the image vergence at the exit of the system.\n\nIn the context of the eye, for an object to be seen in clear focus, the image must be formed on the retina. The state of the eye's optical system that achieves this is determined by its refractive state and any accommodation it exerts. Let us define the far point of the eye as the object point that is conjugate to the retina when the eye is unaccommodated (i.e., accommodation $A=0$). The vergence of the far point, denoted $L_{FP}$, is the vergence required *at the corneal plane* for light to be focused on the retina by the *unaccommodated* eye.\n\nThe clinical definition of ocular refraction, $R$, given in the problem, is the corrective power required at the corneal plane to focus an object at optical infinity ($u \\to \\infty$, so $L_{obj}=0$) onto the retina. A corrective lens of power $R$ placed at the cornea takes light from infinity and forms a virtual object at the eye's far point. Applying the lensmaker's equation to this corrective lens, with the object at infinity ($L=0$) and the corrective power being $R$, the image vergence is $L'_{lens} = 0 + R = R$. This image serves as the object for the eye, and since it is focused by the unaccommodated eye, its vergence must be the far point vergence. Therefore, we establish the crucial relationship:\n$$L_{FP} = R$$\nFor an emmetrope, $R=0$, so the far point is at infinity, and $L_{FP}=0$ D. For a hyperope, $R > 0$, so the far point is a virtual object behind the eye, and $L_{FP} > 0$ D. This is consistent with optical principles.\n\nNow, consider viewing a near object. The object is at a distance $u$, creating an object vergence $L = \\frac{n}{u}$ at the cornea. To bring this object into focus, the eye must adjust its total power. The problem defines accommodation, $A$, as the increment in ocular power. In the vergence framework, this accommodative power $A$ adds to the object vergence. For the final image to be focused on the retina, the combination of the object vergence and accommodation must equal the vergence of the far point. This gives the fundamental equation for accommodative demand:\n$$L + A = L_{FP}$$\nSubstituting $L_{FP} = R$, we get:\n$$L + A = R$$\nRearranging for the accommodative demand $A$ yields the general formula:\n$$A = R - L$$\nThis formula states that the accommodation required is the amount needed to overcome the eye's refractive error ($R$) and the divergence of the light from the near object (represented by $-L$).\n\nWe will now apply this formula to both patients.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Object Vergence, $L$**\nThe object is held at a distance $u = -0.4~\\text{m}$. The refractive index of the surrounding medium (air) is $n=1$. The object vergence at the corneal plane is:\n$$L = \\frac{n}{u} = \\frac{1}{-0.4~\\text{m}} = -2.5~\\text{m}^{-1} = -2.5~\\text{D}$$\nThis vergence is the same for both patients as it depends only on the object's location.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Accommodative Demand for Patient $\\mathcal{E}$ (Emmetrope)**\nFor an emmetropic patient, the ocular refraction is zero by definition.\n$$R_{\\mathcal{E}} = 0~\\text{D}$$\nUsing the derived formula for accommodative demand:\n$$A_{\\mathcal{E}} = R_{\\mathcal{E}} - L = 0~\\text{D} - (-2.5~\\text{D}) = 2.5~\\text{D}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the accommodative demand for the emmetropic patient is $A_{\\mathcal{E}} = 2.50~\\text{D}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Accommodative Demand for Patient $\\mathcal{H}$ (Hyperope)**\nFor the hyperopic patient, the uncorrected spherical refractive error at the corneal plane is given as:\n$$R_{\\mathcal{H}} = +1.50~\\text{D}$$\nUsing the same formula for accommodative demand:\n$$A_{\\mathcal{H}} = R_{\\mathcal{H}} - L = 1.50~\\text{D} - (-2.5~\\text{D}) = 1.50~\\text{D} + 2.5~\\text{D} = 4.0~\\text{D}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the accommodative demand for the hyperopic patient is $A_{\\mathcal{H}} = 4.00~\\text{D}$.\n\nThe hyperopic eye must accommodate not only to focus the divergent light from the near object (which requires $2.50~\\text{D}$ of accommodation, the same as the emmetrope) but must also accommodate an additional $1.50~\\text{D}$ to overcome its own refractive error (i.e., its inability to focus parallel light without accommodation). The total accommodative demand is therefore the sum of these two components.\n\nThe results for the accommodative demand are $A_{\\mathcal{E}} = 2.50~\\text{D}$ and $A_{\\mathcal{H}} = 4.00~\\text{D}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2.50 & 4.00 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4648854"}, {"introduction": "While demand quantifies the task, amplitude defines the eye's capacity.

We will proceed by applying the fundamental principles of Gaussian optics to a simplified model of the eye.\n\nThe relationship between object distance $u$, image distance $v$, and the optical power $P$ of a thin optical system is given by the vergence formula:\n$$ \\frac{n'}{v} - \\frac{n}{u} = P $$\nHere, $n$ is the refractive index of the object space and $n'$ is the refractive index of the image space. The problem specifies that the object is in a medium with $n=1$ (approximating air) and that a Gaussian sign convention is used, where real objects have a negative algebraic distance $u$. Substituting $n=1$, the formula becomes:\n$$ \\frac{n'}{v} - \\frac{1}{u} = P $$\n\nFirst, we consider the eye in its unaccommodated state, which is its state of rest when viewing distant objects. An emmetropic eye is, by definition, an eye that focuses parallel rays of light onto the retina without any accommodation. Parallel rays come from an object at optical infinity, so the object distance is $u \\to -\\infty$. The image is formed on the retina, which is at a fixed anatomical distance $v_{\\text{retina}}$ from the eye's principal plane. Let the power of the unaccommodated eye be $P_{\\text{unacc}}$. Applying the vergence formula to this state gives:\n$$ \\frac{n'}{v_{\\text{retina}}} - \\frac{1}{-\\infty} = P_{\\text{unacc}} $$\nAs $\\frac{1}{-\\infty} = 0$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{n'}{v_{\\text{retina}}} = P_{\\text{unacc}} \\quad (1) $$\nThis equation defines the baseline power of the emmetropic eye, determined by its fixed physical properties ($n'$ and $v_{\\text{retina}}$).\n\nNext, we consider the eye in its fully accommodated state, when it is focusing on an object at its near point. The near point is the closest possible distance at which an object can be held and still be seen in sharp focus. Let this algebraic distance be $u_{\\text{near}}$. The image is still formed on the retina at the same distance $v_{\\text{retina}}$. In this state, the eye's optical power is at its maximum, $P_{\\text{acc}}$. The vergence equation for the fully accommodated eye is:\n$$ \\frac{n'}{v_{\\text{retina}}} - \\frac{1}{u_{\\text{near}}} = P_{\\text{acc}} \\quad (2) $$\n\nThe problem defines the maximum accommodative amplitude, $A_{\\max}$, as the maximal increase in the eye's optical power over its unaccommodated state. This provides a direct relationship between $P_{\\text{acc}}$ and $P_{\\text{unacc}}$:\n$$ P_{\\text{acc}} = P_{\\text{unacc}} + A_{\\max} \\quad (3) $$\n\nTo find an expression for $u_{\\text{near}}$, we can now combine these three equations.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying the provided principles in logical sequence.\n\nFirst, we determine the total dioptric demand of the near task at the spectacle plane. According to Principle 1, the object vergence $L$ for an object at distance $u$ is given by $L = -\\frac{1}{u}$. The task demand, $D_{\\text{task}}$, is the magnitude of this vergence.\nGiven $u = -0.4~\\text{m}$, the vergence is:\n$$L = -\\frac{1}{-0.4~\\text{m}} = +2.5~\\text{m}^{-1}$$\nSince $1~\\text{diopter (D)} = 1~\\text{m}^{-1}$, the vergence is $L = +2.5~\\text{D}$.\nThe dioptric demand of the task is therefore:\n$$D_{\\text{task}} = |L| = |+2.5~\\text{D}| = 2.5~\\text{D}$$\n\nNext, we establish the relationship between the task demand, the patient's accommodative effort, and the prescribed reading addition. According to Principle 2, for the patient to see the near object clearly, the sum of the accommodative effort used ($A_{\\text{used}}$) and the power of the reading addition ($A_{\\text{add}}$) must equal the total task demand.\n$$D_{\\text{task}} = A_{\\text{used}} + A_{\\text{add}}$$\n\nNow, we apply the comfortable reserve criterion from Principle 3.
