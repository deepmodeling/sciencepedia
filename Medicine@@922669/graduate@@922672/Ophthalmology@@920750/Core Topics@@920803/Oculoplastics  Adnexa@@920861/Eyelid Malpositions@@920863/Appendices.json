The positions of the globe and corneal light reflex are fixed.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, using standard definitions and procedures from ophthalmology (e.g., $\\mathrm{MRD}$, $\\mathrm{PFH}$, Müller muscle resection). The definitions are precise and allow for the creation of a formal geometric model. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary information to establish the relationship between $\\mathrm{PFH}$, $\\mathrm{MRD}_1$, and $\\mathrm{MRD}_2$. The language is objective and quantitative. The predicted surgical outcomes are realistic. No violations of scientific principles, logical inconsistencies, or ambiguities are present. The interpretation of \"lowering $\\mathrm{MRD}_2$\" as a decrease in its numerical value is consistent with the goal of a lower eyelid retraction repair, which is to raise the lower eyelid, thereby reducing its distance from the corneal light reflex.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete and reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nTo determine the net change in the palpebral fissure height ($\\mathrm{PFH}$), we must first establish the mathematical relationship between $\\mathrm{PFH}$, the upper eyelid margin reflex distance ($\\mathrm{MRD}_1$), and the lower eyelid margin reflex distance ($\\mathrm{MRD}_2$).\n\nLet us establish a one-dimensional vertical coordinate system, $y$, with its origin ($y=0$) at the position of the corneal light reflex. By convention, positions above the reflex are positive, and positions below are negative.\nLet $y_{upper}$ be the coordinate of the upper eyelid margin and $y_{lower}$ be the coordinate of the lower eyelid margin.\n\nAccording to the problem's definition, $\\mathrm{MRD}_1$ is the linear distance from the corneal light reflex to the upper eyelid margin. Since the upper eyelid is above the reflex, its position $y_{upper}$ is positive. Distance is a non-negative quantity. Therefore:\n$$ \\mathrm{MRD}_1 = |y_{upper}| = y_{upper} $$\n\nSimilarly, $\\mathrm{MRD}_2$ is the linear distance from the corneal light reflex to the lower eyelid margin. The lower eyelid is typically below the reflex, so its position $y_{lower}$ is negative. Therefore:\n$$ \\mathrm{MRD}_2 = |y_{lower}| = -y_{lower} $$\n\nThe palpebral fissure height, $\\mathrm{PFH}$, is defined as the linear distance between the upper and lower eyelid margins. This is calculated as the higher coordinate minus the lower coordinate:\n$$ \\mathrm{PFH} = y_{upper} - y_{lower} $$\n\nWe can now express $\\mathrm{PFH}$ in terms of $\\mathrm{MRD}_1$ and $\\mathrm{MRD}_2$ by substituting the expressions for $y_{upper}$ and $y_{lower}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{PFH} = (\\mathrm{MRD}_1) - (-\\mathrm{MRD}_2) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{PFH} = \\mathrm{MRD}_1 + \\mathrm{MRD}_2 $$\n\nThis linear relationship allows us to determine the change in $\\mathrm{PFH}$ directly from the changes in $\\mathrm{MRD}_1$ and $\\mathrm{MRD}_2$. Let $\\Delta$ denote the change in a quantity after the surgical procedures. The change in the palpebral fissure height, $\\Delta\\mathrm{PFH}$, can be expressed as:\n$$ \\Delta\\mathrm{PFH} = \\Delta(\\mathrm{MRD}_1 + \\mathrm{MRD}_2) $$\nBecause the relationship is a simple sum, the change in the sum is the sum of the changes:\n$$ \\Delta\\mathrm{PFH} = \\Delta\\mathrm{MRD}_1 + \\Delta\\mathrm{MRD}_2 $$\n\nThe problem provides the values for $\\Delta\\mathrm{MRD}_1$ and $\\Delta\\mathrm{MRD}_2$.\nThe Müller muscle-conjunctival resection is predicted to increase $\\mathrm{MRD}_1$ by $2\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. Thus:\n$$ \\Delta\\mathrm{MRD}_1 = +2\\ \\mathrm{mm} $$\nThe lower eyelid retraction treatment is predicted to lower $\\mathrm{MRD}_2$ by $1\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. This corresponds to a decrease in the value of $\\mathrm{MRD}_2$. Thus:\n$$ \\Delta\\mathrm{MRD}_2 = -1\\ \\mathrm{mm} $$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $\\Delta\\mathrm{PFH}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\mathrm{PFH} = (2\\ \\mathrm{mm}) + (-1\\ \\mathrm{mm}) $$\n$$ \\Delta\\mathrm{PFH} = 1\\ \\mathrm{mm} $$\n\nThe net change in the palpebral fissure height is an increase of $1\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "4674336"}, {"introduction": "Transitioning from diagnosis to surgical planning requires a predictive framework that connects a surgical action to an expected outcome.

The observed change is $\\Delta Y = Y_2 - Y_1$.\nThe null hypothesis $H_0$ is that there is no true change, i.e., $m_1 = m_2$. Under $H_0$:\n$$ \\Delta Y = m_2 - m_1 + \\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_1 = 0 + \\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_1 = \\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_1 $$\nThe distribution of the observed change under the null hypothesis is therefore the distribution of the difference of two independent, identically distributed normal random variables.\n$$ E[\\Delta Y | H_0] = E[\\epsilon_2] - E[\\epsilon_1] = 0 - 0 = 0 $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\Delta Y | H_0) = \\text{Var}(\\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_1) = \\text{Var}(\\epsilon_2) + \\text{Var}(\\epsilon_1) = \\sigma^2 + \\sigma^2 = 2\\sigma^2 $$\nSo, under $H_0$, the observed change $\\Delta Y$ is normally distributed with mean $0$ and standard deviation $\\text{SD}(\\Delta Y) = \\sqrt{2\\sigma^2} = \\sigma\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nTo find $\\sigma$, we relate it to the quantity we calculated, $s_d$. The theoretical distribution of the interobserver differences $d_{i,k}$ is:\n$$ d_{i,k} = y_{i,A,k} - y_{i,B,k} = (m_i + \\epsilon_{i,A,k}) - (m_i + \\epsilon_{i,B,k}) = \\epsilon_{i,A,k} - \\epsilon_{i,B,k} $$\nThe variance of these differences is:\n$$ \\text{Var}(d_{i,k}) = \\text{Var}(\\epsilon_{i,A,k} - \\epsilon_{i,B,k}) = \\text{Var}(\\epsilon_{i,A,k}) + \\text{Var}(\\epsilon_{i,B,k}) = \\sigma^2 + \\sigma^2 = 2\\sigma^2 $$\nThe sample variance $s_d^2$ is an estimator for $\\text{Var}(d_{i,k})$. Thus, $s_d^2 \\approx 2\\sigma^2$. This implies that the standard deviation of a single measurement error, $\\sigma$, can be estimated as $\\sigma \\approx \\sqrt{s_d^2/2} = s_d/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe standard deviation of the change score $\\Delta Y$ is $\\sigma\\sqrt{2}$. We can estimate this directly: $\\text{SD}(\\Delta Y) \\approx (s_d/\\sqrt{2}) \\times \\sqrt{2} = s_d$.\nSo, $s_d$ is the empirical estimate for the standard deviation of an observed difference between two single measurements when no true change has occurred.\n\nThe MDC95 is defined as the critical value from the normal distribution for $95\\%$ confidence (two-tailed, $\\alpha=0.05$) multiplied by the standard deviation of the change under the null hypothesis.
