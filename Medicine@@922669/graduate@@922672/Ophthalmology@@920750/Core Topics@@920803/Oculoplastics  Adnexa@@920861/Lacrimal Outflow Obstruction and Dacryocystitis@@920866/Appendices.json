The application of the Hagen–Poiseuille law to model flow in a biological duct is a standard and valid approach in biophysics and physiological modeling. While the assumptions of a rigid tube and Newtonian fluid are simplifications—biological tissues are compliant and tear film has some non-Newtonian properties—they are reasonable for a first-order analysis to isolate the dominant effect of radius change.

It is scientifically sound, formally structured, complete, and internally consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\nThe problem requires the application of the Hagen–Poiseuille law, which describes the volumetric flow rate $Q$ of an incompressible, Newtonian fluid in laminar flow through a long cylindrical pipe of constant cross-section. The law is expressed as:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P r^{4}}{8 \\eta L} $$\nwhere $r$ is the radius of the pipe, $L$ is its length, $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop across the length, and $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nLet $Q_{1}$ be the volumetric flow rate in the baseline state (State A) with radius $r_{1}$, and $Q_{2}$ be the flow rate in the inflamed state (State B) with radius $r_{2}$. According to the problem statement, $\\Delta P$, $\\eta$, and $L$ are constant between these two states.\n\nApplying the Hagen–Poiseuille equation to each state:\n$$ Q_{1} = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P r_{1}^{4}}{8 \\eta L} $$\n$$ Q_{2} = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P r_{2}^{4}}{8 \\eta L} $$\n\nThe objective is to find the fractional decrease in the volumetric flow rate, which is defined as the change in flow rate divided by the original flow rate. Let this fractional decrease be denoted by $F_D$.\n$$ F_D = \\frac{Q_{1} - Q_{2}}{Q_{1}} $$\nThis expression can be simplified to:\n$$ F_D = 1 - \\frac{Q_{2}}{Q_{1}} $$\n\nTo find the ratio $\\frac{Q_{2}}{Q_{1}}$, we divide the equation for $Q_{2}$ by the equation for $Q_{1}$:\n$$ \\frac{Q_{2}}{Q_{1}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi \\Delta P r_{2}^{4}}{8 \\eta L}}{\\frac{\\pi \\Delta P r_{1}^{4}}{8 \\eta L}} $$\nThe constant term $\\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$ cancels, yielding a simple relationship based only on the radii:\n$$ \\frac{Q_{2}}{Q_{1}} = \\frac{r_{2}^{4}}{r_{1}^{4}} = \\left(\\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}}\\right)^{4} $$\n\nSubstituting this ratio back into the expression for the fractional decrease $F_D$, we arrive at the required analytic expression:\n$$ F_D = 1 - \\left(\\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}}\\right)^{4} $$\nThis expression is dimensionless, as required.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given values: $r_{1} = 0.30\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and $r_{2} = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\nThe ratio of the radii is:\n$$ \\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}} = \\frac{0.20\\ \\mathrm{mm}}{0.30\\ \\mathrm{mm}} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nThe units of millimeters cancel, which is dimensionally consistent.\n\nNow substitute this value into the expression for $F_D$:\n$$ F_D = 1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{4} $$\nCalculating the fourth power:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{4} = \\frac{2^{4}}{3^{4}} = \\frac{16}{81} $$\nTherefore, the fractional decrease is:\n$$ F_D = 1 - \\frac{16}{81} = \\frac{81}{81} - \\frac{16}{81} = \\frac{65}{81} $$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we compute the decimal value of this fraction and round to four significant figures:\n$$ F_D = \\frac{65}{81} \\approx 0.8024691... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$ F_D \\approx 0.8025 $$\n\nThis result indicates an $80.25\\%$ reduction in tear outflow. The fourth-power dependence of flow rate on radius ($Q \\propto r^{4}$) in the Hagen–Poiseuille equation signifies that even a small change in the radius of the canaliculus has a profoundly amplified effect on its drainage capacity. In this case, a reduction of the radius to two-thirds of its original value does not reduce flow by one-third, but rather reduces it by over $80\\%$. Clinically, such a drastic impairment of the lacrimal drainage system's ability to clear tears would overwhelm its capacity, leading to significant and persistent overflow of tears onto the cheek, a condition known as severe epiphora. This physically-based model thus provides a quantitative explanation for why anatomically small changes in the lacrimal pathways due to inflammation or stenosis can cause disproportionately severe clinical symptoms.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8025}$$", "id": "4687769"}, {"introduction": "Effective clinical practice hinges on correctly interpreting diagnostic tests to update our assessment of a patient's condition.

It presents a standard problem in clinical biostatistics that can be solved using fundamental principles of probability.\n\nTo compute the positive predictive value (PPV), we first define the relevant events and translate the given information into probabilistic terms.\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has true nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO).\nLet $D^c$ be the complementary event that a patient does not have NLDO.\nLet $T^+$ be the event of a positive Fluorescein Dye Disappearance Test (FDDT).\nLet $T^-$ be the event of a negative FDDT.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\nThe pretest probability of NLDO, which is the prevalence of the disease in the specified cohort:\n$$P(D) = 0.40$$\nThe probability of not having NLDO is therefore:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$$\nThe sensitivity of the FDDT, which is the probability of a positive test given the presence of the disease:\n$$\\text{Sensitivity} = P(T^+ | D) = 0.85$$\nThe specificity of the FDDT, which is the probability of a negative test given the absence of the disease:\n$$\\text{Specificity} = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.75$$\n\nWe are asked to compute the positive predictive value (PPV), which is the post-test probability of having NLDO given that the test result is positive. This is the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem to calculate the PPV:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, summing over the two possible disease states (present or absent):\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, this becomes:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nWe have most of the terms needed for this calculation, but we must first find $P(T^+ | D^c)$, the probability of a positive test in a patient without NLDO. This is the false positive rate. Since for any patient without the disease, the test can be either positive or negative, this probability is the complement of the specificity:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$$\n\nNow we can calculate the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.85)(0.40) + (0.25)(0.60)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.34 + 0.15$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.49$$\n\nWith $P(T^+)$ known, we can now substitute all the values into the Bayes' theorem formula to find the PPV:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{(0.85)(0.40)}{0.49}$$\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{0.34}{0.49} = \\frac{34}{49}$$\n\nPerforming the division gives the numerical value:\n$$P(D | T^+) \\approx 0.69387755...$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$\\text{PPV} \\approx 0.694$$\n\nThe clinical meaning of this PPV of approximately $0.694$ (or $69.4\\%$) is that for a patient from this cohort who tests positive on the FDDT, the probability that they truly have NLDO has increased from the pretest probability of $40\\%$ to an updated, post-test probability of $69.4\\%$. This substantial increase in certainty is clinically significant. It indicates that a positive FDDT is a strong, though not perfect, indicator of the disease. In the context of triaging patients, this result provides a quantitative justification for proceeding to more definitive and often more invasive or costly confirmatory investigations, such as dacryocystography (DCG). Furthermore, because NLDO is the primary predisposing factor for dacryocystitis, a high post-test probability heightens concern for this complication and strengthens the rationale for considering surgical intervention (e.g., dacryocystorhinostomy) to restore lacrimal drainage, alleviate symptoms, and prevent recurrent infections.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.694}$$", "id": "4687778"}, {"introduction": "Surgical decision-making is rarely one-size-fits-all; it requires tailoring evidence-based options to the individual patient.
