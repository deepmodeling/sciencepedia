A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for the expected postoperative margin reflex distance 1 ($MRD1$) of the contralateral eyelid following unilateral ptosis surgery. The physiological basis for the change is Hering's law of equal innervation. In a patient with unilateral ptosis, the central nervous system increases the neural output to both levator palpebrae superioris muscles in an attempt to elevate the ptotic eyelid. This increased innervation also affects the contralateral, non-ptotic eyelid, causing it to be held in a higher position than it would be at baseline innervation. This phenomenon is known as a Hering's dependency.\n\nSurgically correcting the ptosis on the affected side removes the stimulus for this excessive central drive. As the neural innervation to both eyelids returns to a normal baseline, the contralateral eyelid, which was previously artifactually retracted, will drop to a lower position.\n\nLet $MRD1_{\\text{contra, pre}}$ represent the preoperative $MRD1$ of the contralateral eyelid.\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n$$MRD1_{\\text{contra, pre}} = 5\\,\\text{mm}$$\n\nLet $\\Delta MRD1_{\\text{drop}}$ represent the magnitude of the drop in the contralateral eyelid's position. The problem states this drop is approximately $1\\,\\text{mm}$ to $2\\,\\text{mm}$. We are instructed to use the midpoint of this range as the point estimate.\nThe midpoint is calculated as the average of the lower and upper bounds of the range:\n$$\\Delta MRD1_{\\text{drop}} = \\frac{1\\,\\text{mm} + 2\\,\\text{mm}}{2} = \\frac{3\\,\\text{mm}}{2} = 1.5\\,\\text{mm}$$\n\nThe expected postoperative $MRD1$ of the contralateral eyelid, $MRD1_{\\text{contra, post}}$, is the preoperative $MRD1$ minus the drop in position.\n$$MRD1_{\\text{contra, post}} = MRD1_{\\text{contra, pre}} - \\Delta MRD1_{\\text{drop}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given and calculated values:\n$$MRD1_{\\text{contra, post}} = 5\\,\\text{mm} - 1.5\\,\\text{mm}$$\n$$MRD1_{\\text{contra, post}} = 3.5\\,\\text{mm}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $3.5$ has two significant figures. To express this with three significant figures, we add a trailing zero.\n$$MRD1_{\\text{contra, post}} = 3.50\\,\\text{mm}$$\nThe expected postoperative $MRD1$ of the contralateral eyelid is $3.50\\,\\text{mm}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.50}$$", "id": "4719097"}, {"introduction": "For patients with good levator function, a posterior approach like Müller’s muscle-conjunctival resection (Müllerectomy) can be highly effective.

The parameters—levator excursion ($E$), margin reflex distance (MRD1), lagophthalmos ($L$), Bell's phenomenon, and frontalis suspension—are standard concepts in ptosis evaluation and management. The provided numerical values ($E = 3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, preoperative MRD1 = $0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $h_m = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) are clinically realistic for the described scenario. The core principle of balancing lid elevation against corneal exposure risk is a fundamental challenge in ptosis surgery. The physical model is simplified (quasi-static, linear, inelastic), which is a common and acceptable practice for creating a solvable problem based on a complex biological system.\n\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It requests the determination of two specific quantities, $L_{\\text{tol}}$ and $S$, based on a set of clearly defined relationships and constraints.

However, interpreting $L$ as the final vertical position of the upper eyelid margin relative to a closure line at the pupil center ($y=0$) is a standard simplification in such models.

Determination of Lagophthalmos Tolerance, $L_{\\text{tol}}$**\n\nThe problem defines the acceptable postoperative lagophthalmos tolerance, $L_{\\text{tol}}$, as the largest value of lagophthalmos, $L$, that does not exceed the inferior tear meniscus height, $h_m$. The tear meniscus is stated to be able to bridge this gap, thus protecting the cornea.\n\nThis condition is expressed by the inequality:\n$$L \\leq h_m$$\nThe largest value of $L$ satisfying this condition is therefore equal to $h_m$.\n$$L_{\\text{tol}} = h_m$$\nGiven the value $h_m = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, the tolerance is:\n$$L_{\\text{tol}} = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\n**2. Determination of the Optimal Sling Setting, $S$**\n\nThe sling setting, $S$, is defined as the postoperative margin reflex distance one (MRD1) when the frontalis muscle is at rest. This is the static height of the upper eyelid margin above the pupil center in primary gaze.\n\nDuring sleep, the frontalis muscle is relaxed. The problem states that the upper eyelid descends from this resting position by an amount determined by the relaxation of the levator muscle, which is quantified by the preoperative levator excursion, $E$. The system is assumed to be inelastic, so the sling itself does not stretch.\n\nLet the vertical position of the upper eyelid margin relative to the pupillary center be $y_{UL}$. The sling sets this position to $S$ when the frontalis is at rest:\n$$y_{UL, \\text{rest}} = S$$\nDuring sleep, the lid descends by the amount $E$. The final position of the upper eyelid during sleep is:\n$$y_{UL, \\text{sleep}} = y_{UL, \\text{rest}} - E = S - E$$\nPostoperative lagophthalmos, $L$, is defined as the residual gap. As established in the validation, this is modeled as the final height of the upper eyelid margin above the designated line of full closure, which is the pupillary midline ($y=0$).\n$$L = y_{UL, \\text{sleep}} = S - E$$\nThe surgical goal is to maximize the postoperative elevation, $S$, subject to the constraint that lagophthalmos does not exceed the acceptable tolerance, $L_{\\text{tol}}$.\n$$L \\leq L_{\\text{tol}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $L$:\n$$S - E \\leq L_{\\text{tol}}$$\nTo maximize $S$, we solve for $S$ from the above inequality and select the upper bound:\n$$S \\leq L_{\\text{tol}} + E$$\nThe maximum value of $S$ that satisfies the corneal protection constraint is:\n$$S_{\\text{max}} = L_{\\text{tol}} + E$$\nWe now substitute the known values for $L_{\\text{tol}}$ and $E$.\n$$L_{\\text{tol}} = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$E = 3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$S = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{mm} + 3\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 3.3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe problem asks for the answers to be rounded to three significant figures.\nThe calculated value for $L_{\\text{tol}}$ is $0.30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.
