The terms sensitivity, specificity, true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative are standard, well-defined concepts in epidemiology and clinical research. The context is a realistic medical application in ophthalmology.\n\nThe data provided are internally consistent. The sum of the outcomes in the $2 \\times 2$ contingency table is $TP + FP + TN + FN = 45 + 5 + 40 + 10 = 100$, which matches the total cohort size given.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe performance of a binary classification test is evaluated using several key metrics, including sensitivity and specificity. These metrics quantify the test's accuracy with respect to a gold standard, which in this case is histopathology.\n\nThe condition of interest is \"cystic.\" Therefore:\n- The presence of the condition corresponds to a lesion being truly cystic.\n- The absence of the condition corresponds to a lesion being truly solid.\n\nThe total number of patients who actually have the condition (truly cystic lesions) is the sum of the true positives and false negatives. A true positive ($TP$) is a patient with a cystic lesion correctly identified by the ultrasound. A false negative ($FN$) is a patient with a cystic lesion incorrectly identified as solid by the ultrasound.\n$$ \\text{Total with condition} = TP + FN $$\nGiven the values, the number of patients with cystic lesions is:\n$$ TP + FN = 45 + 10 = 55 $$\n\nThe total number of patients who do not have the condition (truly solid lesions) is the sum of the true negatives and false positives. A true negative ($TN$) is a patient with a solid lesion correctly identified by the ultrasound. A false positive ($FP$) is a patient with a solid lesion incorrectly identified as cystic by the ultrasound.\n$$ \\text{Total without condition} = TN + FP $$\nGiven the values, the number of patients with solid lesions is:\n$$ TN + FP = 40 + 5 = 45 $$\nNote that the sum of these two groups is $(TP + FN) + (TN + FP) = 55 + 45 = 100$, which matches the total cohort size.\n\n**Sensitivity** is defined as the proportion of individuals with the condition who are correctly identified by the test. It is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual has the condition. The formula for sensitivity is:\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{45}{45 + 10} = \\frac{45}{55} = \\frac{9}{11} $$\nAs a decimal, this is $0.818181...$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $0.8182$.\n\n**Specificity** is defined as the proportion of individuals without the condition who are correctly identified by the test. It is the probability of a negative test result given that the individual does not have the condition. The formula for specificity is:\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{40}{40 + 5} = \\frac{40}{45} = \\frac{8}{9} $$\nAs a decimal, this is $0.888888...$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $0.8889$.\n\nThe final answer requires these two values, sensitivity and specificity, in a single row matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.8182 & 0.8889 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4657057"}, {"introduction": "While sensitivity and specificity describe a test's performance in isolation, clinical practice demands an answer to a different question: what is the probability that this patient has the condition, given their test result?

The rule returns a binary decision: “benign” or “suspicious for malignancy.” Consider the class of benign eyelid tumors, including lesions such as intradermal nevus, papilloma, seborrheic keratosis, and chalazion. Define “condition present” to mean that the lesion is benign and define a “positive test” to mean the decision rule outputs “benign.” The clinical decision rule is characterized by sensitivity and specificity with respect to the benign class. The sensitivity is the probability that the test is positive given the lesion is benign. The specificity is the probability that the test is negative given the lesion is malignant. Let the pretest probability that an eyelid lesion in this clinic is benign be $0.85$. For this clinical decision rule, the sensitivity is $0.92$ and the specificity is $0.80$. Using first principles of conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem, derive the expression for the post-test probability that a lesion is benign given that the decision rule outputs “benign,” and then compute its value for the given parameters.

The concepts of sensitivity, specificity, pretest probability (prevalence), and post-test probability (positive predictive value) are fundamental principles in biostatistics and evidence-based medicine.

All quantities are clearly defined, and there is no ambiguity or subjective language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to compute the post-test probability $P(B | T^+)$, which is the probability that a lesion is truly benign given that the decision rule has classified it as “benign.” This quantity is also known as the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test for the benign condition.\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$ P(B | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | B) P(B)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, by considering the two mutually exclusive scenarios in which a positive test can occur: the lesion is truly benign ($B$), or the lesion is malignant ($M$).\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | B) P(B) + P(T^+ | M) P(M) $$\nSubstituting this into Bayes' theorem gives the full expression for $P(B | T^+)$:\n$$ P(B | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | B) P(B)}{P(T^+ | B) P(B) + P(T^+ | M) P(M)} $$\nWe are given the following values:\n-   The pretest probability of a benign lesion, $P(B) = 0.85$.\n-   The sensitivity, $P(T^+ | B) = 0.92$.\n-   The specificity, $P(T^- | M) = 0.80$.\n\nFrom these givens, we can derive the remaining required probabilities.\nThe events $B$ (benign) and $M$ (malignant) are complementary. Therefore, the pretest probability of a malignant lesion is:\n$$ P(M) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15 $$\nThe specificity gives the probability of a negative test for a malignant lesion. The probability of a positive test for a malignant lesion, $P(T^+ | M)$, is the complement of the specificity, as for any given condition, the test must be either positive or negative. This is a false positive rate with respect to the benign class.\n$$ P(T^+ | M) = 1 - P(T^- | M) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 $$\nNow we have all the necessary components to compute $P(B | T^+)$. We substitute the numerical values into the derived expression:\n$$ P(B | T^+) = \\frac{(0.92) \\times (0.85)}{(0.92) \\times (0.85) + (0.20) \\times (0.15)} $$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, which represents the probability of a true positive result (the lesion is benign AND the test is positive):\n$$ P(T^+ \\cap B) = P(T^+ | B) P(B) = 0.92 \\times 0.85 = 0.782 $$\nNext, we calculate the probability of a false positive result (the lesion is malignant AND the test is positive):\n$$ P(T^+ \\cap M) = P(T^+ | M) P(M) = 0.20 \\times 0.15 = 0.030 $$\nThe total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$, is the sum of these two probabilities:\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.782 + 0.030 = 0.812 $$\nFinally, we compute the post-test probability $P(B | T^+)$:\n$$ P(B | T^+) = \\frac{0.782}{0.812} \\approx 0.963054187... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P(B | T^+) \\approx 0.9631 $$\nThis is the post-test probability that a lesion is benign given that the decision rule outputs “benign.”", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.9631} $$", "id": "4657077"}, {"introduction": "The management of benign eyelid tumors often involves a period of \"watchful waiting,\" which requires objective methods to monitor for change.
