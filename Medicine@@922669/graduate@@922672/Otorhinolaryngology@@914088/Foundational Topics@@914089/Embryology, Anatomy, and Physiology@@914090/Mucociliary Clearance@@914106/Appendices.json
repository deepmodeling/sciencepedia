In the standard two-layer mucus model of the respiratory epithelium, the overlying gel layer is transported tangentially by coordinated ciliary beating over a nearly stationary periciliary sol layer. Consider a micron-scale tracer particle embedded within the gel layer such that inertial effects are negligible and the particle motion is dominated by viscous coupling to the mucus. Under these conditions, assume that the particle is advected with the local mucus velocity along the epithelial surface.\n\nLet the transport occur along a smooth epithelial streamline parameterized by arc length coordinate $s$ with total path length $L$. The kinematic definition of speed is $v=ds/dt$. During the observation, the transport speed is experimentally found to be spatially uniform along the streamline and temporally steady with magnitude $v$.

This is a critical simplification, as it means $v$ can be treated as a constant throughout the particle's journey.\n\nTo determine the total time of flight $T$, we must solve this first-order ordinary differential equation. We can accomplish this by separating the variables $s$ and $t$:\n$$ds = v \\, dt$$\nNext, we integrate both sides of this equation over the defined path of the particle.

This corresponds to the regime of creeping flow, also known as Stokes flow, characterized by a very low Reynolds number ($Re \\ll 1$). In this regime, the dominant resisting force is viscous drag.\n\nThe net transport speed, $v$, is established by a balance between the propulsive force generated by the cilia, $F_c$, and the viscous drag force, $F_d$. At steady state, these forces are equal:\n$$F_c = F_d$$\nFor creeping flow, the governing Stokes equations are linear in velocity and pressure. A fundamental consequence of this linearity is that the drag force on an object moving through the fluid, or the drag exerted by a fluid moving over a surface, is directly proportional to both the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, $\\mu$, and a characteristic velocity, $v$. This relationship can be expressed generally as:\n$$F_d = C \\mu v$$\nThe coefficient $C$ is a geometric factor that depends on the shape and size of the flow domain but is independent of the fluid properties ($\\mu$) or the flow speed ($v$). In this problem, the geometry of the nasal epithelium and the mucus layer is assumed to be constant. Thus, $C$ is a constant.\n\nBy substituting the expression for $F_d$ into the force balance equation, we obtain:\n$$F_c = C \\mu v$$\nThe problem states that the propulsive force $F_c$ also remains constant during the short-term intervention. We can rearrange the equation to express the transport speed $v$ in terms of the other parameters:\n$$v = \\frac{F_c}{C \\mu}$$\nSince both $F_c$ and $C$ are constants, we can deduce the scaling relationship between speed and viscosity:\n$$v \\propto \\frac{1}{\\mu}$$\nThis shows that the mucociliary transport speed is inversely proportional to the dynamic viscosity of the mucus.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the scaling relationship to the given conditions.**\n\nLet the baseline (pre-irrigation) state be denoted by the subscript $0$ and the post-irrigation state by the subscript $1$.
