The VOR is a short-latency stabilizing reflex driven primarily by semicircular canal afferents.\n    2.  Gaze-holding requires a neural integrator to convert eye-velocity commands into sustained eye-position signals.\n    3.  Unilateral peripheral vestibular lesions typically produce unidirectional nystagmus that obeys Alexander’s Law.\n-   Question: Infer if the lesion is central or peripheral, and identify the plausibly implicated central pathway structures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a classic clinical presentation in neuro-otology. The described signs—direction-changing gaze-evoked nystagmus and normal VOR gain on video head impulse testing (vHIT)—are well-documented and form the basis for a standard diagnostic algorithm (e.g., the HINTS protocol). The physiological principles provided (VOR, neural integrator, Alexander's law) are fundamental, correct, and directly relevant to the problem. The definition of VOR gain $G$ is standard. The problem is scientifically sound.\n\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a specific and internally consistent set of clinical findings and asks for a neuroanatomical localization based on these findings. The combination of signs is not contradictory; in fact, the dissociation between the findings (impaired gaze-holding with intact high-frequency VOR) is the key to localization. A unique and meaningful solution is derivable.\n\n3.  **Objective:** The problem statement is composed of objective clinical descriptions (e.g., \"$15^{\\circ}$ left\") and established physiological facts. It is free from ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n\n4.  **Other Flaws:** The problem setup is complete, with no missing or contradictory information. The scenario is clinically realistic. The terminology is standard within the field.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-formed, scientifically grounded question requiring deductive reasoning from established principles of neurophysiology. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds in two steps as requested: first, differentiating between a central and peripheral lesion, and second, identifying the specific implicated structures.\n\n**1. Central vs. Peripheral Localization**\n\nA core principle of vestibular diagnosis is to distinguish peripheral lesions (involving the labyrinth or vestibular nerve) from central lesions (involving the brainstem or cerebellum).\n\n-   **Peripheral Lesion Hallmarks:** A unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction (e.g., vestibular neuritis) results in a static imbalance of tonic vestibular inputs. This typically causes a spontaneous nystagmus that is **unidirectional** (fast phase beats away from the lesion), obeys **Alexander's Law** (nystagmus intensity increases on gaze toward the fast phase direction and decreases on gaze away), and is suppressed by visual fixation. Crucially, such a lesion disrupts the VOR pathway, leading to an **abnormal head impulse test** (gain $G \\ll 1.0$ and corrective saccades) when the head is turned rapidly toward the affected side.\n\n-   **Patient's Presentation Analysis:**\n    -   The patient exhibits **direction-changing gaze-evoked nystagmus**. The fast phase is to the left on left gaze and to the right on right gaze. This violates the \"unidirectional\" and \"Alexander's Law\" characteristics of a typical peripheral lesion.\n    -   The patient has a **normal video head impulse test** ($G \\approx 1.0$, no corrective saccades). This indicates that the high-frequency function of the VOR arc—comprising the semicircular canals, vestibular nerve, vestibular nuclei relay neurons, and ocular motor neurons—is intact. This finding is a powerful argument against a significant peripheral vestibular lesion.\n\n-   **Inference:** The combination of direction-changing gaze-evoked nystagmus and a normal head impulse test is highly suggestive of a **central lesion**.\n\n**2. Identification of Implicated Central Structures**\n\nHaving established a central localization, we must identify the structures responsible for the specific signs. The problem is the concurrence of normal high-frequency VOR with impaired gaze-holding.\n\n-   **Gaze-Evoked Nystagmus (GEN):** Holding the eye in an eccentric position requires a \"position\" command to the extraocular muscles to counteract the elastic forces pulling the eye back to center. This position signal ($\\theta_{\\text{eye}}$) is generated by mathematically integrating an eye velocity signal ($\\dot{\\theta}_{\\text{eye}}$). This function is performed by a network called the **neural integrator**.\n    -   If the neural integrator is \"leaky,\" it cannot sustain the position command. The eye then drifts back towards the primary position (the slow phase of nystagmus). The central nervous system generates a corrective saccade to re-acquire the eccentric target (the fast phase). This cycle of drift-and-correction is GEN.\n    -   The patient's nystagmus is purely **horizontal**. Therefore, the lesion must affect the **horizontal neural integrator**.\n\n-   **Anatomy of the Horizontal Neural Integrator:** The primary structures responsible for horizontal gaze integration are the **nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (NPH)** and the **medial vestibular nucleus (MVN)** in the brainstem. This NPH-MVN complex receives crucial input and calibration from the **cerebellar flocculus and paraflocculus**. A lesion in any part of this network can lead to a leaky integrator and, consequently, horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus.\n\n-   **Reconciliation with Normal VOR Gain:** The VOR tested by vHIT is a short-latency reflex that directly converts head velocity signals from the canals into compensatory eye velocity signals. While the MVN is a key node in this reflex, its role as part of the neural integrator is a separate function. A lesion can selectively impair the integrator function within the NPH-MVN-floccular network without disrupting the high-frequency throughput of the direct VOR pathway. This explains the observed dissociation between abnormal gaze-holding and normal vHIT results.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:** The patient's clinical picture of horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus with a normal high-frequency VOR points specifically to a lesion within the horizontal neural integrator network, which comprises the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, the medial vestibular nucleus, and the cerebellar flocculus/paraflocculus.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Cerebellar flocculus–paraflocculus and the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi–medial vestibular nucleus horizontal neural integrator complex**\nThis option lists the precise anatomical structures that constitute the horizontal neural integrator. A dysfunction in this network is the established cause of horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus. A lesion here is fully consistent with the preservation of the high-frequency VOR as tested by vHIT.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Superior vestibular nerve and lateral semicircular canal ampulla on one side**\nThis describes a peripheral lesion. As detailed above, such a lesion would cause unidirectional nystagmus and an abnormal head impulse test, which contradicts the patient's findings.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Paramedian pontine reticular formation and abducens nucleus as the horizontal saccade generator**\nThe paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) generates the velocity command for horizontal saccades (\"burst generator\"), it does not hold gaze position. A lesion here would cause a slowing or absence of saccades (a saccadic palsy), not a failure of gaze-holding.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Interstitial nucleus of Cajal and rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus as the vertical–torsional neural integrator**\nThe interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC) is the neural integrator for vertical and torsional movements, and the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF) is the burst generator for vertical/torsional saccades. A lesion here would affect vertical/torsional eye movements, whereas the patient's signs are restricted to the horizontal plane.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Cerebellar nodulus and uvula mediating velocity storage of vestibular signals**\nThe nodulus and uvula are key for the velocity storage mechanism, which primarily affects low-frequency vestibular responses and the influence of gravity on the VOR. Lesions here cause different oculomotor signs, such as persistent downbeating nystagmus or periodic alternating nystagmus, not typically isolated gaze-evoked nystagmus as described. This mechanism is distinct from the gaze-holding neural integrator.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5011321"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of lesion localization, this practice delves deeper into the specific neuroanatomical pathways of the VOR. You are asked to predict and contrast the precise eye movement patterns observed during a head impulse test in two distinct conditions: a peripheral vestibular loss and a specific central brainstem lesion affecting the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). This exercise reinforces your understanding of how the brain orchestrates conjugate eye movements and how a disruption in the MLF leads to the characteristic disconjugate pattern of internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) [@problem_id:5011350].", "problem": "An examiner performs the bedside head impulse test in the plane of the horizontal semicircular canals on two different patients while recording each eye separately. Patient X has a clinically and radiologically confirmed right internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) due to a medial longitudinal fasciculus lesion. Patient Y has an acute, isolated right unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction consistent with vestibular neuritis. Assume the head impulses are small-amplitude, high-acceleration, unpredictable rotations about the vertical axis, and that the patient fixates a distant target to minimize vergence demands. The examiner applies equal numbers of rightward and leftward impulses.\n\nStarting from the following fundamental base: (i) semicircular canal afferents encode head angular velocity, (ii) the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) aims to minimize retinal slip by producing eye angular velocity approximately equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to head angular velocity, and (iii) the abducens nucleus contains motor neurons to the ipsilateral lateral rectus and internuclear neurons that project via the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus for medial rectus activation, reason through the central vestibular circuitry to predict how the patterns of VOR gain and catch-up saccades will differ between Patient X and Patient Y.\n\nFor the purposes of this question, define the instantaneous VOR gain for each eye as $g = \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye}} / \\omega_{\\mathrm{head}}$ with the conventional sign suppressed so that ideal compensation corresponds to $g \\approx 1$, and a deficit to $g  1$. A catch-up saccade that occurs after the head impulse is completed is termed an overt saccade; those occurring during the head motion are termed covert saccades. The examiner’s principal observations are whether the deficit is conjugate or disconjugate across the two eyes and whether it depends on the required adduction versus abduction of a given eye.\n\nWhich option best predicts the expected pattern for Patient X and Patient Y, and provides the correct mechanism?\n\nA. Patient X (right INO): On rightward head impulses (which require leftward eye rotation), the right (adducting) eye has $g  1$ with overt/covert catch-up saccades, while the left (abducting) eye shows $g \\approx 1$; on leftward impulses both eyes have $g \\approx 1$. Patient Y (right peripheral hypofunction): On rightward impulses both eyes show reduced $g  1$ with overt/covert catch-up saccades; on leftward impulses both eyes show $g \\approx 1$. Mechanism: INO selectively disrupts the internuclear pathway in the MLF to the contralateral medial rectus, sparing abducens motor output; peripheral loss reduces right horizontal canal afferent drive, lowering bilateral VOR output for impulses toward the lesioned side but preserving conjugacy.\n\nB. Patient X (right INO): Bilateral and symmetric reduction of $g$ with overt catch-up saccades for both rightward and leftward impulses due to a central lesion; Patient Y (right peripheral hypofunction): Disconjugate VOR with selective impairment of the right eye during rightward impulses because the labyrinth drives only the ipsilateral eye. Mechanism: Central lesions generalize VOR failure, whereas peripheral input is eye-specific.\n\nC. Patient X (right INO): Normal horizontal VOR for all impulses because the VOR is a reflex that bypasses central pathways; Patient Y (right peripheral hypofunction): Reduced $g$ for both directions due to bilateral commissural inhibition in the vestibular nuclei. Mechanism: The VOR does not require the MLF for horizontal responses but is globally suppressed by unilateral peripheral loss.\n\nD. Patient X (right INO): Predominantly vertical corrective saccades on rightward impulses due to otolith-ocular coupling, with normal horizontal gains; Patient Y (right peripheral hypofunction): Horizontal gains are normal due to central compensation, but torsional catch-up saccades appear toward the lesioned side. Mechanism: INO primarily affects vertical gaze coupling; peripheral hypofunction spares horizontal gains at high acceleration.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of neuro-otology, is well-posed with clearly defined conditions and patient pathologies, and is expressed in objective, formal language. The provided fundamental principles are accurate and sufficient to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks to predict the outcomes of the horizontal head impulse test (hHIT) for two patients based on fundamental principles of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR).\n\n**Fundamental Principles and Pathways**\n\nThe three-neuron arc for the horizontal VOR is the primary pathway to consider.\n1.  **Afferent Neuron:** The primary afferent neuron from the horizontal semicircular canal projects from the vestibular (Scarpa's) ganglion to the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei in the brainstem. Its firing rate encodes head angular velocity, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{head}}$. Excitation occurs for head rotation toward the ipsilateral side.\n2.  **Internuclear Neuron:** Excitatory neurons in the vestibular nucleus cross the midline to project to the contralateral abducens nucleus.\n3.  **Motor Neurons:** The abducens nucleus contains two key populations of neurons:\n    *   **Motor neurons** that project via the abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI) to innervate the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle, causing eye abduction.\n    *   **Internuclear neurons** that project via the contralateral medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) to the medial rectus subnucleus of the oculomotor nucleus (cranial nerve III). This activates the contralateral medial rectus muscle, causing eye adduction.\n\nThe goal of the VOR is to generate an eye angular velocity, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eye}}$, that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the head angular velocity, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{head}}$. The gain, $g = \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye}} / \\omega_{\\mathrm{head}}$ (with sign convention suppressed), should be approximately $1$. A gain less than $1$ ($g  1$) signifies a deficient VOR, causing the retinal image to slip and necessitating a corrective \"catch-up\" saccade to refoveate the target.\n\n**Analysis of Patient X: Right Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia (INO)**\n\nPatient X has a lesion of the **right MLF**. This lesion specifically disrupts the pathway from the **left abducens internuclear neurons** to the **right oculomotor nucleus**. This pathway is essential for activating the **right medial rectus** muscle for adduction.\n\n*   **Case 1: Rightward Head Impulse**\n    *   **Head Motion:** The head rotates to the right.\n    *   **VOR Goal:** The eyes must rotate to the left to maintain fixation. This requires contraction of the **left lateral rectus (LLR)** and the **right medial rectus (RMR)**.\n    *   **Neural Pathway:**\n        1.  The right horizontal canal is excited.\n        2.  The right vestibular nucleus projects excitatorily to the contralateral (left) abducens nucleus.\n        3.  The left abducens nucleus:\n            *   Activates its motor neurons, causing the LLR to contract (abduction of the left eye). This pathway is intact.\n            *   Activates its internuclear neurons, which send signals up the **right MLF** to the right oculomotor nucleus to activate the RMR.\n    *   **Effect of Lesion:** The right MLF is lesioned. The signal to the right medial rectus is blocked or severely attenuated.\n    *   **Predicted Outcome:**\n        *   **Left Eye (abducting):** The pathway to the LLR is intact. The left eye will abduct with a normal gain ($g \\approx 1$).\n        *   **Right Eye (adducting):** The pathway to the RMR is disrupted. The right eye will fail to adduct or will adduct very slowly. Its gain will be significantly less than $1$ ($g  1$). A catch-up saccade (overt or covert) of the right eye will be required to bring it to the target.\n        *   **Summary:** A disconjugate VOR deficit, with specific failure of the adducting right eye.\n\n*   **Case 2: Leftward Head Impulse**\n    *   **Head Motion:** The head rotates to the left.\n    *   **VOR Goal:** The eyes must rotate to the right. This requires contraction of the **right lateral rectus (RLR)** and the **left medial rectus (LMR)**.\n    *   **Neural Pathway:**\n        1.  The left horizontal canal is excited.\n        2.  The left vestibular nucleus projects to the contralateral (right) abducens nucleus.\n        3.  The right abducens nucleus:\n            *   Activates its motor neurons, causing the RLR to contract (abduction of the right eye).\n            *   Activates its internuclear neurons, which send signals up the **left MLF** to the left oculomotor nucleus to activate the LMR.\n    *   **Effect of Lesion:** The lesion is in the right MLF. This pathway uses the right abducens nucleus and the left MLF, both of which are intact.\n    *   **Predicted Outcome:** Both pathways are functional. Both eyes will rotate to the right conjugately and with normal gain ($g \\approx 1$). No catch-up saccades are expected.\n\n**Analysis of Patient Y: Acute Right Unilateral Peripheral Vestibular Hypofunction**\n\nPatient Y has a deficient afferent signal from the right vestibular labyrinth. Central pathways are assumed to be intact. The hHIT is a high-acceleration test, and the VOR response is primarily driven by excitation of the contralateral labyrinth (Ewald's second law).\n\n*   **Case 1: Rightward Head Impulse (toward the lesioned side)**\n    *   **Head Motion:** The head rotates to the right.\n    *   **VOR Goal:** Eyes rotate to the left.\n    *   **Neural Pathway:** This motion is supposed to excite the right horizontal canal.\n    *   **Effect of Lesion:** The right labyrinth has hypofunction. The excitatory afferent signal for this movement is weak or absent. The overall drive to the VOR circuitry is severely reduced.\n    *   **Predicted Outcome:**\n        *   The weak signal from the right vestibular nucleus is transmitted to the left abducens nucleus, which then drives both the left lateral rectus and (via the MLF) the right medial rectus.\n        *   Because the initial drive is deficient, the command to *both* muscles is insufficient.\n        *   Both eyes will lag the head turn. The VOR gain will be reduced bilaterally and conjugately ($g  1$ for both eyes).\n        *   This will necessitate conjugate, leftward catch-up saccades (overt or covert) to refixate the target.\n\n*   **Case 2: Leftward Head Impulse (away from the lesioned side)**\n    *   **Head Motion:** The head rotates to the left.\n    *   **VOR Goal:** Eyes rotate to the right.\n    *   **Neural Pathway:** This motion excites the healthy **left horizontal canal**. It also inhibits the right canal, but since the right canal is already dysfunctional, the loss of inhibition is negligible compared to the strong excitatory drive from the left.\n    *   **Effect of Lesion:** The primary driving signal for this VOR comes from the intact left labyrinth.\n    *   **Predicted Outcome:**\n        *   The strong signal from the left vestibular nucleus provides adequate drive to the right abducens nucleus, which in turn drives both the right lateral rectus and the left medial rectus correctly.\n        *   The VOR response will be robust and effective.\n        *   The gain for both eyes will be approximately normal ($g \\approx 1$). No catch-up saccades are expected.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Patient X (right INO): On rightward head impulses (which require leftward eye rotation), the right (adducting) eye has $g  1$ with overt/covert catch-up saccades, while the left (abducting) eye shows $g \\approx 1$; on leftward impulses both eyes have $g \\approx 1$. Patient Y (right peripheral hypofunction): On rightward impulses both eyes show reduced $g  1$ with overt/covert catch-up saccades; on leftward impulses both eyes show $g \\approx 1$. Mechanism: INO selectively disrupts the internuclear pathway in the MLF to the contralateral medial rectus, sparing abducens motor output; peripheral loss reduces right horizontal canal afferent drive, lowering bilateral VOR output for impulses toward the lesioned side but preserving conjugacy.**\n    *   This option perfectly matches the detailed predictions derived above for both patient X and patient Y. The described mechanism is precisely the correct neurophysiological explanation.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Patient X (right INO): Bilateral and symmetric reduction of $g$ with overt catch-up saccades for both rightward and leftward impulses due to a central lesion; Patient Y (right peripheral hypofunction): Disconjugate VOR with selective impairment of the right eye during rightward impulses because the labyrinth drives only the ipsilateral eye.**\n    *   The prediction for patient X is incorrect. The VOR deficit in INO is disconjugate and direction-specific, not bilateral and symmetric. The prediction for patient Y is also incorrect. Peripheral vestibular loss causes a conjugate deficit, and the labyrinthine input is distributed to muscles of both eyes, not just the ipsilateral eye. The mechanism is flawed.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Patient X (right INO): Normal horizontal VOR for all impulses because the VOR is a reflex that bypasses central pathways; Patient Y (right peripheral hypofunction): Reduced $g$ for both directions due to bilateral commissural inhibition in the vestibular nuclei.**\n    *   The premise that the VOR bypasses central pathways like the MLF is fundamentally incorrect. The MLF is essential for yoking the eyes. The prediction for patient Y is also wrong; the deficit is characteristically unilateral for high-frequency head turns.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Patient X (right INO): Predominantly vertical corrective saccades on rightward impulses due to otolith-ocular coupling, with normal horizontal gains; Patient Y (right peripheral hypofunction): Horizontal gains are normal due to central compensation, but torsional catch-up saccades appear toward the lesioned side.**\n    *   The prediction for patient X is incorrect. The hHIT would elicit a horizontal adduction deficit with horizontal catch-up saccades. The claim of normal horizontal gains is false for the adducting eye. The prediction for patient Y is incorrect. In an acute condition, central compensation has not occurred, and the HIT is specifically designed to reveal the low gain. The deficit is in the horizontal canal plane, so saccades should be horizontal.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5011350"}, {"introduction": "Beyond stabilizing gaze, central vestibular pathways are essential for maintaining posture. This problem shifts our focus from the semicircular canal-driven VOR to the otolith-driven vestibulospinal reflexes.

Use the following experimentally grounded modeling assumptions for small-to-moderate static roll tilts:\n1. The otolith organs transduce the component of gravitational acceleration along the utricular hair cell polarization axis, and the change in utricular afferent firing rate is proportional to this component. For a pure roll tilt about the naso-occipital axis, the relevant component scales as the sine of the roll angle when referenced to the gravitational vector.\n2.

The change in the firing rate of the LVST neurons, $\\Delta f_{\\text{LVST}}$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta f_{\\text{LVST}} = G_{\\text{v}} \\cdot \\Delta f_{\\text{ot}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta f_{\\text{ot}}$ from Step 1:\n$$\n\\Delta f_{\\text{LVST}} = G_{\\text{v}} S_{\\text{ot}} \\sin(\\theta)\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Activation of Ipsilateral Extensor Motoneurons**\n\nThe LVST projects to and excites ipsilateral extensor motoneurons. The increase in the normalized activation of these motoneurons, $\\Delta A_{\\text{m}}$, is linearly proportional to the change in the LVST firing rate, with a gain of $G_{\\text{m}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta A_{\\text{m}} = G_{\\text{m}} \\cdot \\Delta f_{\\text{LVST}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta f_{\\text{LVST}}$ from Step 2 gives the complete expression for the change in muscle activation in terms of the initial tilt angle and system gains:\n$$\n\\Delta A_{\\text{m}} = G_{\\text{m}} (G_{\\text{v}} S_{\\text{ot}} \\sin(\\theta)) = G_{\\text{m}} G_{\\text{v}} S_{\\text{ot}} \\sin(\\theta)\n$$\nThis final symbolic expression represents the total gain of the reflex pathway for a static roll tilt.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the values:\n-   $G_{\\text{m}} = 0.03\\,\\text{activation}/\\text{Hz}$\n-   $G_{\\text{v}} = 0.4$\n-   $S_{\\text{ot}} = 60\\,\\text{Hz}/g$\n-   $\\theta = 10^{\\circ}$\n\nThe problem requires that the angle be converted to radians for the trigonometric function calculation, which is standard practice. $\\sin(10^{\\circ})$ is equivalent to $\\sin(\\frac{10\\pi}{180}) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{18})$.\n\nSubstituting the numerical values into the derived equation:\n$$\n\\Delta A_{\\text{m}} = (0.03) \\cdot (0.4) \\cdot (60) \\cdot \\sin(10^{\\circ})\n$$\nFirst, calculate the product of the gains:\n$$\nG_{\\text{m}} \\cdot G_{\\text{v}} \\cdot S_{\\text{ot}} = 0.03 \\cdot 0.4 \\cdot 60 = 0.012 \\cdot 60 = 0.72\n$$\nThe units of this combined gain are $(\\text{activation}/\\text{Hz}) \\cdot (\\text{dimensionless}) \\cdot (\\text{Hz}/g) = \\text{activation}/g$. Since the stimulus is expressed as a dimensionless fraction of $g$ (i.e., $\\sin(\\theta)$), the final activation is also dimensionless, as required.\n\nNow, we complete the calculation:\n$$\n\\Delta A_{\\text{m}} = 0.72 \\cdot \\sin(10^{\\circ})\n$$\nThe value of $\\sin(10^{\\circ})$ is approximately $0.17364817766$.\n$$\n\\Delta A_{\\text{m}} \\approx 0.72 \\cdot 0.17364817766 \\approx 0.1250266879\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $2$, $5$, and $0$. The fifth digit is $2$, so we do not round up.\n$$\n\\Delta A_{\\text{m}} \\approx 0.1250\n$$\nThis is the expected increase in ipsilateral extensor muscle activation, expressed as a unitless fraction of baseline.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1250}\n$$", "id": "5011366"}]}
