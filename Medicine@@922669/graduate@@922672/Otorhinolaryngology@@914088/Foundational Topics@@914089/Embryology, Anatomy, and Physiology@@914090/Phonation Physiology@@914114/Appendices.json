The problem asks us to start from the definition that mechanical power is the time rate of work done by pressure forces on a control surface. Work ($W$) is defined as the product of force ($F$) and displacement ($s$), and power ($P$) is the time derivative of work, $P = \\frac{dW}{dt}$.\n\nIn a fluid system, the force exerted by a pressure $p$ on a surface of area $A$ is $F = pA$. For an infinitesimal displacement $ds$ of the fluid, the work done is $dW = F ds = (pA)ds$. The term $A \\cdot ds$ represents an infinitesimal volume of fluid, $dV$. Therefore, the work done can be expressed as $dW = p \\, dV$.\n\nPower is the rate at which this work is performed:\n$$ P = \\frac{dW}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(p \\, dV) $$\nAssuming the pressure $p$ is constant over the timescale of the volume change, we have:\n$$ P = p \\frac{dV}{dt} $$\nThe term $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ is, by definition, the volumetric flow rate of the fluid, which is denoted in the problem by $U$. Thus, the mechanical power associated with a fluid flow is given by the product of pressure and volumetric flow rate:\n$$ P = pU $$\nThe problem specifies that for the laryngeal system, the energy is supplied by the lungs in the form of subglottal pressure, $P_s$. We are instructed to consider the work done by this pressure over the glottal inlet and to neglect the contribution of supraglottal pressure. Under these approximations, the total aerodynamic power supplied to the glottis is the work done by the subglottal pressure to drive the airflow. For a sustained phonatory task under quasi-steady conditions, we consider the mean subglottal pressure and mean volumetric airflow. Therefore, the mean aerodynamic power delivered to the vocal folds is:\n$$ P_{aero} = P_s U $$\nwhere $P_s$ and $U$ represent the mean values of subglottal pressure and volumetric airflow, respectively. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we calculate the predicted change in Sound Pressure Level ($\\Delta \\text{SPL}$) between Condition A and Condition B. The given data are:\n- Condition A: $P_{s,A} = 7.5 \\text{ cm H}_2\\text{O}$ and $U_A = 0.10 \\text{ L/s}$.\n- Condition B: $P_{s,B} = 12.0 \\text{ cm H}_2\\text{O}$ and $U_B = 0.14 \\text{ L/s}$.\n\nThe problem states that the radiated acoustic power, $P_{ac}$, scales proportionally with the aerodynamic power, $P_{aero}$. We can write this relationship as $P_{ac} = \\eta P_{aero}$, where $\\eta$ is a constant of proportionality representing the glottal efficiency. It is assumed that $\\eta$ is the same for both conditions.\n\nThe change in SPL, measured in decibels (dB), is defined by the base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the acoustic powers:\n$$ \\Delta \\text{SPL} = \\text{SPL}_B - \\text{SPL}_A = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{P_{ac,B}}{P_{ac,A}}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the proportionality for acoustic power, we get:\n$$ \\Delta \\text{SPL} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\eta P_{aero,B}}{\\eta P_{aero,A}}\\right) = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{P_{aero,B}}{P_{aero,A}}\\right) $$\nNow, we use our derived expression for aerodynamic power, $P_{aero} = P_s U$:\n$$ \\Delta \\text{SPL} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{P_{s,B} U_B}{P_{s,A} U_A}\\right) $$\nWe can now substitute the numerical values. Note that since we are calculating a ratio, the specific units of pressure and flow do not matter as long as they are consistent between the two conditions. The conversion factors from cm H$_2$O to Pascals and from L/s to m$^3$/s would appear in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus cancel out.\n\nLet's compute the ratio of the products:\n$$ \\frac{P_{s,B} U_B}{P_{s,A} U_A} = \\frac{(12.0)(0.14)}{(7.5)(0.10)} = \\frac{1.68}{0.75} = 2.24 $$\nNow, we can calculate the change in SPL:\n$$ \\Delta \\text{SPL} = 10 \\log_{10}(2.24) $$\nUsing a calculator for the logarithm:\n$$ \\Delta \\text{SPL} \\approx 10 \\times 0.3502478 \\approx 3.502478 \\text{ dB} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta \\text{SPL} \\approx 3.502 \\text{ dB} $$\nThis value represents the predicted increase in sound pressure level from Condition A to Condition B based on the changes in aerodynamic parameters.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.502}\n$$", "id": "5061234"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models are powerful, but their parameters must be validated with real-world measurements, which present their own challenges.

The solution involves two main steps: first, relating the true intraoral pressure to the subglottal pressure based on the provided physiological assumptions, and second, modeling the measurement system to correct the recorded value and find the true pressure.\n\nFirst, we analyze the physiological context. The problem states that during the bilabial occlusion for the consonant /p/, the glottis is abducted. This means the vocal folds are open, creating a low-resistance pathway between the subglottal space (trachea) and the supraglottal space (oral cavity). The problem also specifies that supraglottal compliance and viscous losses are negligible, and that pressure equilibrates rapidly. Under these conditions, the entire closed airway system, from the trachea to the lips, will reach a single, uniform pressure. This pressure is the subglottal pressure, $P_{\\text{sub}}$, which drives phonation. Therefore, the true, instantaneous intraoral pressure, which we denote as $P_{io, \\text{true}}(t)$, is equal to the subglottal pressure during the lip closure: $P_{io, \\text{true}}(t) = P_{\\text{sub}}$.\n\nBefore the closure, at $t < 0$, the mouth is open for the vowel /i/ that would follow the /p/ (or more accurately, the vowel that precedes it in a sequence like /ipi/), and the intraoral pressure is atmospheric, which is taken as the reference pressure of $0~\\text{Pa}$. At $t=0$, the lips close, sealing the oral cavity. Due to the rapid equilibration, the true intraoral pressure can be modeled as an instantaneous step from $0~\\text{Pa}$ to $P_{\\text{sub}}$. This true pressure, $P_{io, \\text{true}}(t)$, serves as the input signal to the measurement system. We can write this as:\n$$P_{io, \\text{true}}(t) = \\begin{cases} 0~\\text{Pa} & t < 0 \\\\ P_{\\text{sub}} & t \\ge 0 \\end{cases}$$\n\nNext, we model the catheter-transducer system. It is described as a first-order low-pass system with a time constant $\\tau = 0.015~\\text{s}$. The relationship between the input pressure, $P_{io, \\text{true}}(t)$, and the system's output response before any bias, let's call it $P_{m}(t)$, is given by the linear first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\\tau \\frac{dP_{m}(t)}{dt} + P_{m}(t) = P_{io, \\text{true}}(t)$$\nThe initial condition is $P_{m}(0) = 0$, since the pressure was $0~\\text{Pa}$ before the step and the filter's output cannot change instantaneously.\n\nFor $t \\ge 0$, the input is a constant $P_{\\text{sub}}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\\tau \\frac{dP_{m}(t)}{dt} + P_{m}(t) = P_{\\text{sub}}$$\nThe solution to this differential equation for a step input is the standard first-order step response:\n$$P_{m}(t) = P_{\\text{sub}}(1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau))$$\n\nThe problem states that the system has a constant calibration bias of $+20~\\text{Pa}$ at its output. This means the recorded pressure, $P_{rec}(t)$, is the system's dynamic response plus this bias:\n$$P_{rec}(t) = P_{m}(t) + P_{bias}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_{m}(t)$ and the value $P_{bias} = 20~\\text{Pa}$, we get:\n$$P_{rec}(t) = P_{\\text{sub}}(1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau)) + 20$$\n\nWe are given a data point: at time $t = 0.040~\\text{s}$, the recorded pressure is $P_{rec}(0.040) = 930~\\text{Pa}$.
