The most important of these for low-frequency sounds is the Interaural Time Difference (ITD), the slight delay in a sound's arrival time at the far ear compared to the near ear. This foundational exercise guides you through calculating the maximum possible ITD using a simplified but powerful spherical head model, directly connecting the physics of sound to the physiological constraints of the neural circuits, such as those in the Medial Superior Olive (MSO), that have evolved to decode this information.", "problem": "A sound source in the horizontal plane is at azimuth angle $\\theta$ relative to the listener’s midline (front is $\\theta=0$, rightward is $\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$). Assume the head can be modeled as a rigid sphere of radius $r$ with the two ear canals located at antipodal points on the equator of the sphere. A far-field source produces a plane wave at speed of sound $c$ in air. The interaural time difference (ITD) is defined as the difference in acoustic propagation times from the source to the two ear canals.

For a far-field source producing a plane wave, propagation time equals path length divided by sound speed. Let the head be a rigid sphere of radius $r$ with ears at antipodal points on the equator. Consider the horizontal-plane azimuth $\\theta$ measured from the midline (front) toward the right.\n\nFundamental base:\n1. Plane-wave kinematics: For a wave traveling at speed $c$, time equals distance divided by speed, i.e., $t=\\frac{d}{c}$.\n2. Geometric occlusion by a rigid sphere: The farther ear lies in the acoustic shadow for $\\theta\\neq 0$, and the earliest-arriving wavefront at the far ear reaches it by wrapping around the sphere’s surface. The additional path length caused by occlusion can be accounted for via spherical geometry.\n\nWe construct the path-length difference between the far and near ears by decomposing it into two components:\n- A linear-projection component due to the relative positions of the ears with respect to the wave direction.\n- A diffraction wrap-around component due to the rigid spherical occlusion.\n\nFor a spherical head, the well-tested geometric result (Woodworth’s formula) for the path-length difference in the horizontal plane is\n$$\n\\Delta d(\\theta)=r\\big(\\theta+\\sin\\theta\\big),\n$$\nvalid for $0\\leq \\theta\\leq \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, where $\\theta$ is in radians. This expression can be reasoned from first principles as follows. The nearest ear sees the wavefront directly; for the far ear, the earliest wavefront that reaches it must traverse an extra arc along the sphere boundary of angular extent $\\theta$, adding an arc length $r\\theta$, and there is also a geometric projection difference between ears along the wave direction equal to $r\\sin\\theta$. Summing these yields $r(\\theta+\\sin\\theta)$.\n\nBy definition, the ITD is the path-length difference divided by the speed of sound:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ITD}(\\theta)=\\frac{\\Delta d(\\theta)}{c}=\\frac{r}{c}\\big(\\theta+\\sin\\theta\\big).\n$$\nTo find the maximum physiological ITD in the horizontal plane, we restrict $\\theta$ to $[0,\\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ (front to right), noting symmetry for leftward azimuths.

For continuous, low-frequency tones, neurons in the brainstem don't use a stopwatch; instead, they compare the phase of the sound wave arriving at each ear, a value known as the Interaural Phase Difference (IPD). This practice [@problem_id:5011037] demonstrates the conversion from ITD to IPD and introduces the critical concept of phase ambiguity, a computational challenge that arises when the time delay exceeds half of the sound wave's period, helping to explain the operational limits of the brain's timing-based localization system.", "problem": "A low-frequency binaural pure tone stimulus is processed in the brainstem by phase-locked inputs to the Medial Superior Olive (MSO), a key nucleus in the central auditory pathway. Consider a tone of frequency $500\\,\\text{Hz}$ that arrives at the two ears with an Interaural Time Difference (ITD) of $300\\,\\mu\\text{s}$, with the leading ear defined as positive delay. Starting from the fundamental representation of a pure tone as a sinusoid and the effect of a time shift on the phase of a sinusoidal signal, derive the general relationship between ITD and Interaural Phase Difference (IPD). Then use this relationship to compute the IPD for the given stimulus. Finally, assess whether phase ambiguity would arise at this frequency for the given ITD under the constraint that the brainstem comparator inherently treats phase differences periodically, and interpret your result in terms of the mapping between ITD and IPD within one half-cycle of the stimulus.\n\nExpress the interaural phase difference in radians as an exact multiple of $\\pi$. Do not round. Provide only the computed interaural phase difference as your final answer; your reasoning about ambiguity should appear in your working, not in the final answer.", "solution": "First, we establish the mathematical representation of the stimulus. A pure tone can be described by a sinusoidal function of time, $t$. Let the signal arriving at the first ear (the \"near\" ear) be represented as:\n$$S_{near}(t) = A \\sin(\\omega t)$$\nwhere $A$ is the amplitude and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. The angular frequency is related to the frequency $f$ by $\\omega = 2\\pi f$.\n\nThe signal arrives at the second ear (the \"far\" ear) after a delay equal to the Interaural Time Difference (ITD), which we denote as $\\Delta t$. Therefore, the signal at the far ear is a time-shifted version of the signal at the near ear:\n$$S_{far}(t) = A \\sin(\\omega (t - \\Delta t))$$\nTo determine the phase difference, we expand the argument of the sine function for the far ear's signal:\n$$S_{far}(t) = A \\sin(\\omega t - \\omega \\Delta t)$$\nThe phase of the signal at any given time $t$ is the argument of the sine function. Thus, the phase of the near ear's signal is $\\phi_{near}(t) = \\omega t$, and the phase of the far ear's signal is $\\phi_{far}(t) = \\omega t - \\omega \\Delta t$.\n\nThe Interaural Phase Difference (IPD), denoted as $\\Delta\\phi$, is the difference between the phases of the signals at the two ears. We define it as the phase of the leading signal (near ear) minus the phase of the lagging signal (far ear):\n$$\\Delta\\phi = \\phi_{near}(t) - \\phi_{far}(t) = (\\omega t) - (\\omega t - \\omega \\Delta t)$$\n$$\\Delta\\phi = \\omega \\Delta t$$\nSubstituting the relation $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, we arrive at the general relationship between IPD, frequency, and ITD:\n$$\\Delta\\phi = 2\\pi f \\Delta t$$\nThis is the required general relationship.\n\nNext, we compute the IPD for the given stimulus. The problem provides the following values:\n- Frequency, $f = 500\\,\\text{Hz}$\n- Interaural Time Difference, $\\Delta t = 300\\,\\mu\\text{s} = 300 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{s} = 3 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{s}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived relationship:\n$$\\Delta\\phi = 2\\pi (500) (3 \\times 10^{-4})$$\n$$\\Delta\\phi = 2\\pi (1500 \\times 10^{-4})$$\n$$\\Delta\\phi = 2\\pi (0.15)$$\n$$\\Delta\\phi = 0.3\\pi$$\nAs an exact fraction, this is $\\Delta\\phi = \\frac{3\\pi}{10}$ radians.\n\nFinally, we assess whether phase ambiguity arises. Phase ambiguity occurs when the magnitude of the ITD is large enough that the neural circuitry cannot distinguish the true phase difference from a phase difference shifted by an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. This corresponds to an ITD that is longer than one period of the stimulus tone. More critically for localization, ambiguity arises if the IPD falls outside the principal range of $[-\\pi, \\pi]$, which corresponds to an ITD magnitude greater than one half-period of the tone. This is because an ITD of $\\Delta t$ producing an IPD of $\\Delta\\phi > \\pi$ would be perceptually identical to a smaller (in magnitude) ITD of $\\Delta t' = \\Delta t - T$ producing an IPD of $\\Delta\\phi - 2\\pi$, where $T = 1/f$ is the period. This ambiguity threatens the unique mapping of IPD to a sound source location.\n\nThe critical ITD for the onset of this ambiguity is one half-period of the tone. The period $T$ of the stimulus is:\n$$T = \\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{500\\,\\text{Hz}} = 0.002\\,\\text{s} = 2000\\,\\mu\\text{s}$$\nThe ITD must be within one half-cycle for unambiguous mapping. The range for unambiguous ITD is therefore $|\\Delta t| < \\frac{T}{2}$:\n$$\\frac{T}{2} = \\frac{2000\\,\\mu\\text{s}}{2} = 1000\\,\\mu\\text{s}$$\nThe given ITD is $\\Delta t = 300\\,\\mu\\text{s}$. Since $300\\,\\mu\\text{s} < 1000\\,\\mu\\text{s}$, the ITD is well within the unambiguous range.\n\nOur calculated IPD, $\\Delta\\phi = 0.3\\pi$ radians, confirms this. The range of IPDs corresponding to one half-cycle is $[0, \\pi]$ (for a source moving from the center to the side). Our value of $0.3\\pi$ is within this range. In general, for a frequency of $500\\,\\text{Hz}$, the maximum physiologically possible ITD in humans (approximately $650\\,\\mu\\text{s}$) is less than the half-period of $1000\\,\\mu\\text{s}$. Therefore, at this frequency, no phase ambiguity arises for any possible location of a sound source in the horizontal plane.
