Empirical, site-specific probabilities of occult metastasis at presentation are estimated as follows: Level IA has probability $p_{\\mathrm{IA}} = 0.08$ and Level IB has probability $p_{\\mathrm{IB}} = 0.22$. Using only core definitions from epidemiology and decision analysis—namely that risk is a probability and that odds compare the probability of an event to its complement—start from first principles to express the odds ratio comparing the odds of occult nodal disease in Level IB to the odds in Level IA in terms of $p_{\\mathrm{IA}}$ and $p_{\\mathrm{IB}}$.

No units are required.", "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of epidemiology and medical decision analysis, well-posed with all necessary information, and presented in an objective, formal manner. I will therefore proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of an odds ratio from first principles, based on given probabilities of an event. Let the event of interest be the presence of occult nodal metastasis. We are given the probabilities of this event in two distinct lymphatic nodal basins, Level IA and Level IB.\n\nLet $p$ denote the probability of an event occurring. The problem states that risk is equivalent to probability. Therefore, the risk of occult metastasis in Level IA is $p_{\\mathrm{IA}}$, and in Level IB is $p_{\\mathrm{IB}}$.\nThe problem defines odds as the ratio of the probability of an event occurring, $p$, to the probability of the event not occurring (its complement), which is $1-p$.\nSo, the general formula for odds is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Odds} = \\frac{p}{1-p} $$\n\nWe can apply this definition to each nodal level.\nFor Level IA, the probability of occult metastasis is given as $p_{\\mathrm{IA}} = 0.08$. The odds of occult metastasis in Level IA, which we shall denote as $\\mathrm{Odds}_{\\mathrm{IA}}$, are therefore:\n$$ \\mathrm{Odds}_{\\mathrm{IA}} = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{IA}}}{1-p_{\\mathrm{IA}}} $$\n\nFor Level IB, the probability of occult metastasis is given as $p_{\\mathrm{IB}} = 0.22$. The odds of occult metastasis in Level IB, denoted as $\\mathrm{Odds}_{\\mathrm{IB}}$, are:\n$$ \\mathrm{Odds}_{\\mathrm{IB}} = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{IB}}}{1-p_{\\mathrm{IB}}} $$\n\nThe problem then asks for the odds ratio ($\\mathrm{OR}$) that compares the odds of occult disease in Level IB to the odds in Level IA. The odds ratio is the ratio of the odds in the group of interest (Level IB) to the odds in the reference or comparison group (Level IA).\nTherefore, the odds ratio, which we denote as $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\mathrm{IB\\;vs\\;IA}}$, is given by the expression:\n$$ \\mathrm{OR}_{\\mathrm{IB\\;vs\\;IA}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Odds}_{\\mathrm{IB}}}{\\mathrm{Odds}_{\\mathrm{IA}}} $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the individual odds, we derive the general formula for the odds ratio in terms of the probabilities $p_{\\mathrm{IA}}$ and $p_{\\mathrm{IB}}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{OR}_{\\mathrm{IB\\;vs\\;IA}} = \\frac{\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{IB}}}{1-p_{\\mathrm{IB}}}}{\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{IA}}}{1-p_{\\mathrm{IA}}}} = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{IB}}(1-p_{\\mathrm{IA}})}{p_{\\mathrm{IA}}(1-p_{\\mathrm{IB}})} $$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the odds ratio as required.\n\nNow, we must evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values: $p_{\\mathrm{IA}} = 0.08$ and $p_{\\mathrm{IB}} = 0.22$.\nFirst, we calculate the probabilities of the complementary events (no occult metastasis):\nFor Level IA: $1 - p_{\\mathrm{IA}} = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92$.\nFor Level IB: $1 - p_{\\mathrm{IB}} = 1 - 0.22 = 0.78$.\n\nNext, we calculate the odds for each level:\n$$ \\mathrm{Odds}_{\\mathrm{IA}} = \\frac{0.08}{0.92} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Odds}_{\\mathrm{IB}} = \\frac{0.22}{0.78} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the odds ratio by dividing $\\mathrm{Odds}_{\\mathrm{IB}}$ by $\\mathrm{Odds}_{\\mathrm{IA}}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{OR}_{\\mathrm{IB\\;vs\\;IA}} = \\frac{\\frac{0.22}{0.78}}{\\frac{0.08}{0.92}} = \\frac{0.22 \\times 0.92}{0.78 \\times 0.08} = \\frac{0.2024}{0.0624} $$\nPerforming the final division gives:\n$$ \\mathrm{OR}_{\\mathrm{IB\\;vs\\;IA}} \\approx 3.2435897... $$\nRounding this result to four significant figures, as instructed, yields $3.244$.\n\nIn the context of clinical decision-making for elective neck dissection, this odds ratio provides a quantitative comparison of the relative risk between the two nodal levels. An odds ratio significantly greater than $1$ indicates that the odds of the outcome (occult metastasis) are substantially higher in the intervention group (Level IB) compared to the reference group (Level IA). An $\\mathrm{OR}$ of $3.244$ signifies that the odds of finding occult cancer in Level IB are over $3$ times the odds of finding it in Level IA. In head and neck oncology, elective treatment of the neck is generally recommended when the probability of occult metastasis exceeds a threshold, often cited as $15-20\\%$. Here, $p_{\\mathrm{IB}} = 0.22$ is above this threshold, strongly supporting surgical treatment (dissection) of Level IB. In contrast, $p_{\\mathrm{IA}} = 0.08$ falls below this threshold. The large odds ratio reinforces this discrepancy in risk, guiding the surgeon to be aggressive in treating Level IB while potentially considering observation or a more limited procedure for Level IA, balancing oncologic safety with treatment-related morbidity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.244}$$", "id": "5038865"}, {"introduction": "Lymphatic metastasis is rarely a random event; it often follows predictable, sequential pathways. This practice [@problem_id:5038940] explores the concept of sequential risk, where the status of an upstream nodal basin directly influences the probability of involvement in downstream basins.

The description of lymphatic metastasis from an oropharyngeal primary tumor (sequential spread to levels II, III, and IV, with the possibility of \"skip\" metastases) is a cornerstone of modern head and neck surgical oncology. The given probabilities are empirically realistic for such a patient cohort. The problem is well-posed, as all necessary data for a unique solution are provided. The terminology is objective and clearly defined. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe objective is to compute the incremental risk, which is defined as the difference between the conditional probability of level IV involvement given level II involvement, $P(\\mathrm{IV}|\\mathrm{II})$, and the unconditional (or total) probability of level IV involvement, $P(\\mathrm{IV})$.\n$$ \\text{Incremental Risk} = P(\\mathrm{IV}|\\mathrm{II}) - P(\\mathrm{IV}) $$\nThe value for $P(\\mathrm{IV}|\\mathrm{II})$ is given as $0.35$. The central task is to calculate the unconditional probability $P(\\mathrm{IV})$.\n\nThe sample space of patients can be partitioned into two mutually exclusive and exhaustive sets: those with level II nodal involvement (event $\\mathrm{II}$) and those without (event $\\neg \\mathrm{II}$). The Law of Total Probability states that the total probability of an event can be found by summing the probabilities of its intersections with a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events. In this case, for event $\\mathrm{IV}$, the law is expressed as:\n$$P(\\mathrm{IV}) = P(\\mathrm{IV} \\cap \\mathrm{II}) + P(\\mathrm{IV} \\cap \\neg \\mathrm{II})$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can rewrite the expression as:\n$$P(\\mathrm{IV}) = P(\\mathrm{IV}|\\mathrm{II})P(\\mathrm{II}) + P(\\mathrm{IV}|\\neg \\mathrm{II})P(\\neg \\mathrm{II})$$\nWe are given the following values:\n$P(\\mathrm{IV}|\\mathrm{II}) = 0.35$\n$P(\\mathrm{II}) = 0.60$\n$P(\\mathrm{IV}|\\neg \\mathrm{II}) = 0.05$\n\nThe probability of the complementary event $\\neg \\mathrm{II}$ can be calculated directly from $P(\\mathrm{II})$:\n$$P(\\neg \\mathrm{II}) = 1 - P(\\mathrm{II}) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$$\nNow, we can substitute all known values into the equation for the total probability of event $\\mathrm{IV}$:\n$$P(\\mathrm{IV}) = (0.35)(0.60) + (0.05)(0.40)$$\nPerforming the multiplication for each term:\n$$P(\\mathrm{IV}) = 0.21 + 0.02$$\n$$P(\\mathrm{IV}) = 0.23$$\nThis value, $P(\\mathrm{IV})=0.23$, represents the unconditional baseline risk of level IV involvement for any patient in this cohort, irrespective of their level II status.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the incremental risk as defined in the problem statement:\n$$\\text{Incremental Risk} = P(\\mathrm{IV}|\\mathrm{II}) - P(\\mathrm{IV})$$\n$$\\text{Incremental Risk} = 0.35 - 0.23$$\n$$\\text{Incremental Risk} = 0.12$$\nThis result signifies that the presence of level II nodal disease increases the absolute probability of finding level IV disease by $12$ percentage points compared to the baseline probability in the overall cohort.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.12}$$", "id": "5038940"}, {"introduction": "In the era of precision medicine, decisions are increasingly guided by diagnostic tests, but no test is perfect.
