It involves the derivation and application of the Henderson-Hasselbalch relationship to a problem in olfactory physiology.\n\nFirst, we will derive the expression for the fraction of the odorant that is ionized, $f_{\\mathrm{ionized}}$. The problem provides the definition of the acid dissociation constant, $K_{a}$, for the equilibrium $HA \\rightleftharpoons H^{+} + A^{-}$:\n$$K_{a} = \\frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]}$$\nHere, $[HA]$ is the concentration of the un-ionized (protonated) acid, $[A^{-}]$ is the concentration of the ionized (deprotonated) conjugate base, and $[H^{+}]$ is the proton concentration.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to express the concentration of the un-ionized form, $[HA]$, in terms of the ionized form, $[A^{-}]$:\n$$[HA] = \\frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{K_{a}}$$\n\nThe fraction of the odorant that is ionized, $f_{\\mathrm{ionized}}$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the ionized form to the total concentration of the odorant (ionized plus un-ionized forms):\n$$f_{\\mathrm{ionized}} = \\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA] + [A^{-}]}$$\n\nWe now substitute the expression for $[HA]$ into the denominator of the equation for $f_{\\mathrm{ionized}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{ionized}} = \\frac{[A^{-}]}{\\left(\\frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{K_{a}}\\right) + [A^{-}]}$$\n\nWe can factor out $[A^{-}]$ from the terms in the denominator:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{ionized}} = \\frac{[A^{-}]}{[A^{-}] \\left(\\frac{[H^{+}]}{K_{a}} + 1\\right)}$$\n\nAssuming the total concentration of the odorant is non-zero, $[A^{-}] \\neq 0$ (unless the acid is extremely weak or the solution is extremely acidic, which is not the case here), we can cancel the $[A^{-}]$ term from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{ionized}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{[H^{+}]}{K_{a}} + 1}$$\n\nTo express this in terms of $pH$ and $pK_{a}$, we use the provided definitions: $pH = -\\log_{10}([H^{+}])$ and $pK_{a} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a})$. These can be rewritten in exponential form as $[H^{+}] = 10^{-pH}$ and $K_{a} = 10^{-pK_{a}}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the ratio $\\frac{[H^{+}]}{K_{a}}$:\n$$\\frac{[H^{+}]}{K_{a}} = \\frac{10^{-pH}}{10^{-pK_{a}}} = 10^{-pH - (-pK_{a})} = 10^{pK_{a} - pH}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this result back into the expression for $f_{\\mathrm{ionized}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{ionized}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pK_{a} - pH}}$$\nThis is a valid closed-form expression. An alternative, and often more convenient, form can be derived by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $10^{pH-pK_{a}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{ionized}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pK_{a} - pH}} \\times \\frac{10^{pH - pK_{a}}}{10^{pH - pK_{a}}} = \\frac{10^{pH - pK_{a}}}{10^{pH - pK_{a}} + 10^{pK_{a} - pH} \\cdot 10^{pH - pK_{a}}} = \\frac{10^{pH - pK_{a}}}{10^{pH - pK_{a}} + 1}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $f_{\\mathrm{ionized}}$ in terms of $pH$ and $pK_{a}$.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the given values: $pH = 6.5$ and $pK_{a} = 4.5$.\n$$f_{\\mathrm{ionized}} = \\frac{10^{6.5 - 4.5}}{1 + 10^{6.5 - 4.5}}$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{ionized}} = \\frac{10^{2}}{1 + 10^{2}} = \\frac{100}{1 + 100} = \\frac{100}{101}$$\n\nTo obtain the numerical value as a decimal rounded to six significant figures:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{ionized}} = \\frac{100}{101} \\approx 0.9900990099...$$\nRounding to six significant figures, we get $0.990099$.\n\nFinally, we provide a mechanistic explanation of how the degree of ionization affects the odorant’s interaction with the olfactory system.\n\nThe process of olfaction requires an odorant molecule to traverse the aqueous nasal mucus, partition into the lipid membrane of the olfactory cilia, and bind to an olfactory receptor (a GPCR) embedded within that membrane. The degree of ionization is a critical determinant of this process.\n\n1.  **Partitioning into the Olfactory Ciliary Membrane:** The ciliary membrane is a lipid bilayer, a fundamentally nonpolar (hydrophobic or lipophilic) environment. The ability of a molecule to pass through this membrane is governed by its polarity and charge.\n    *   The un-ionized form of the odorant, $HA$, is a neutral molecule. While it may have polar functional groups, it is significantly more nonpolar and lipid-soluble (lipophilic) than its ionized counterpart.\n    *   The ionized form, the conjugate base $A^{-}$, is a charged species. This charge makes it highly polar and hydrophilic (lipophobic). It is stabilized by ion-dipole interactions with polar water molecules in the mucus and is strongly repelled by the nonpolar lipid interior of the cell membrane.\n    *   Consequently, only the un-ionized form, $HA$, can efficiently partition from the aqueous mucus into the lipid membrane and diffuse across it. In this problem, the fraction of the un-ionized form, $1 - f_{\\mathrm{ionized}}$, is approximately $1 - 0.990099 = 0.009901$, which is less than $1\\%$. This means that over $99\\%$ of the odorant is \"trapped\" in the mucus as the membrane-impermeant $A^{-}$ ion. The concentration of the membrane-permeant $HA$ form is very low, creating a significant kinetic barrier to reaching the receptor.\n\n2.  **Access to and Binding with Olfactory Receptors (GPCRs):** Olfactory receptors are transmembrane proteins. Their odorant-binding sites are typically located within a pocket formed by the transmembrane helices, meaning the site is situated within the hydrophobic membrane environment.\n    *   **Access Pathway:** For the odorant to reach this binding site, it must first be present within the membrane. As established, this strongly favors the un-ionized $HA$ form. The $HA$ molecule acts as a shuttle, carrying the odorant across the aqueous-lipid interface.\n    *   **Binding Interaction:** Once an $HA$ molecule is near the receptor's binding pocket, the specific chemical nature of the binding event becomes paramount. The binding pocket itself has a microenvironment with various amino acid residues. While the $HA$ form gains access to the pocket, it is possible that the receptor has a higher affinity for the ionized $A^{-}$ form. For instance, a positively charged residue (e.g., lysine or arginine) in the binding pocket could form a strong electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged $A^{-}$ ion. A local equilibrium, $HA \\rightleftharpoons H^{+} + A^{-}$, may exist at the membrane surface or within the binding pocket, allowing the molecule that crossed the membrane as $HA$ to potentially bind as $A^{-}$.\n    *   **Overall Effect:** Regardless of which form ultimately binds with the highest affinity, the initial and rate-limiting step is partitioning into the membrane. A high degree of ionization in the bulk mucus, as seen in this case ($f_{\\mathrm{ionized}} \\approx 0.99$), drastically reduces the effective concentration of the membrane-permeant species ($HA$). This significantly limits the flux of odorant molecules to the receptors, which would be expected to result in a lower perceived odor intensity or a higher odor detection threshold compared to a similar odorant with a higher $pK_{a}$ (and thus a lower degree of ionization at the same $pH$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.990099}$$", "id": "5061700"}, {"introduction": "Once an odorant activates its receptor, the signal is amplified through a G-protein cascade that elevates intracellular cyclic AMP ($cAMP$).

It is scientifically grounded in the established biophysical principles of ion channel gating and cooperative ligand binding, described by the Hill equation. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and definitions ($[cAMP]$, $K_{1/2}$, $n$) to derive the open probability and compute a unique solution. The language is objective and precise, and the given values are physiologically plausible. The problem is self-contained and consistent.\n\nThe first step is to derive the functional dependence of the open probability, $P_o$, on the ligand concentration, which we denote as $[L]$. The problem describes a cooperative binding process characterized by a Hill coefficient, $n$. The relationship between the fractional saturation (or normalized response) and the ligand concentration in such a system is described by the Hill equation.\n\nLet us define $P_o$ as the fraction of channels that are in the open state. According to the problem's assumption of a concerted gating scheme, a channel is open only when all $n$ binding sites are occupied by the ligand (cAMP). This allows us to equate the open probability $P_o$ with the fraction of receptors that are fully bound.\n\nThe general form of the Hill equation for a normalized response $Y$ (which is $P_o$ in this case) is:\n$$\nP_o([L]) = \\frac{[L]^n}{K^n + [L]^n}\n$$\nHere, $K$ is a constant related to the ligand affinity, and $n$ is the Hill coefficient. The problem provides a specific definition for the half-activation concentration, $K_{1/2}$, as the free ligand concentration at which the open probability is $0.5$. We can use this definition to establish the identity of the constant $K$.\n\nBy definition, when $[L] = K_{1/2}$, $P_o = 0.5$. Substituting these into the equation:\n$$\n0.5 = \\frac{K_{1/2}^n}{K^n + K_{1/2}^n}\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by the denominator gives:\n$$\n0.5 (K^n + K_{1/2}^n) = K_{1/2}^n\n$$\n$$\n0.5 K^n + 0.5 K_{1/2}^n = K_{1/2}^n\n$$\n$$\n0.5 K^n = 0.5 K_{1/2}^n\n$$\nThis implies $K^n = K_{1/2}^n$, and since $K$ and $K_{1/2}$ are positive concentrations, we have $K = K_{1/2}$.\n\nThus, the functional dependence of the open probability on the ligand concentration $[L]$ that is consistent with the problem's definitions is:\n$$\nP_o([L]) = \\frac{[L]^n}{K_{1/2}^n + [L]^n}\n$$\nFor this specific problem, the ligand is cAMP, so we write $[L] = [cAMP]$.\n$$\nP_o([cAMP]) = \\frac{[cAMP]^n}{K_{1/2}^n + [cAMP]^n}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation part of the task.\n\nNext, we compute the open probability for the given values:\n- Ligand concentration: $[cAMP] = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- Half-activation concentration: $K_{1/2} = 3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- Hill coefficient: $n = 2$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$\nP_o = \\frac{(5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{2}}{(3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{2} + (5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^{2}}\n$$\nThe units of concentration ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) cancel out, leaving a dimensionless probability:\n$$\nP_o = \\frac{5^2}{3^2 + 5^2} = \\frac{25}{9 + 25} = \\frac{25}{34}\n$$\nTo obtain the numerical value, we perform the division:\n$$\nP_o = \\frac{25}{34} \\approx 0.7352941176...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get $P_o = 0.7353$.\n\nFinally, we must infer the fraction of the macroscopic current, $I$, relative to its maximal value, $I_{max}$. The macroscopic current through a population of $N$ identical channels is given by:\n$$\nI = N \\cdot P_o \\cdot i\n$$\nwhere $i$ is the current through a single open channel (the unitary current).
