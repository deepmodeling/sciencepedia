By exploring the parameter space of this system, you will gain insight into the fundamental logic cells use to make robust, all-or-none developmental decisions.", "problem": "You are to model a minimal Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) for otic placode commitment in the developing ear using a pair of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with positive feedback. A GRN (Gene Regulatory Network) comprises interacting genes and proteins whose concentrations change over time according to regulatory logic. In otic organogenesis, positive feedback loops can lock cells into an otic fate by producing bistability (two distinct, linearly stable steady states). Your task is to derive, implement, and analyze a dimensionless symmetric two-component GRN model for mutual activation and quantify parameter ranges that yield bistability.\n\nBegin from the following fundamental base: (i) the Central Dogma of molecular biology implies production and degradation of gene products over time, (ii) regulatory activation can be represented by a sigmoidal Hill function capturing cooperativity of binding, and (iii) linear degradation represents first-order loss. Let $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ denote dimensionless concentrations of two otic transcriptional determinants with mutual activation. The ODE system is\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = s + m \\, H(y) - d \\, x, \\quad \\frac{dy}{dt} = s + m \\, H(x) - d \\, y,\n$$\nwhere\n$$\nH(z) = \\frac{z^n}{K^n + z^n},\n$$\nand parameters are dimensionless: basal synthesis $s \\ge 0$, maximal feedback strength $m > 0$, degradation rate $d > 0$, activation half-saturation constant $K > 0$, and Hill cooperativity $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $n \\ge 1$. The model is symmetric and captures mutual positive feedback consistent with otic GRN motifs.\n\nDefine the symmetric steady state condition by setting $x = y = u$ and requiring\n$$\ng(u; s,m,d,K,n) = s + m \\frac{u^n}{K^n + u^n} - d \\, u = 0,\n$$\nwith $u \\ge 0$. A symmetric steady state $(u,u)$ is linearly stable if the Jacobian eigenvalues at $(u,u)$ are strictly negative. In this symmetric case, stability reduces to the inequality\n$$\na(u; m,K,n) = m \\, \\frac{n K^n \\, u^{n-1}}{(K^n + u^n)^2} < d.\n$$\nIn this problem, define \"bistability\" to mean the existence of at least two distinct, linearly stable symmetric steady states $(u_1,u_1)$ and $(u_2,u_2)$, $u_1 \\ne u_2$, in the model.\n\nYour program must:\n- For each specified test case, scan $m$ over a closed interval with a fixed step $\\Delta m$ and, for each $m$ in the scan, compute all nonnegative symmetric steady states $u$ solving $g(u)=0$. Determine stability of each symmetric steady state using the criterion $a(u) < d$. Count the number of distinct linearly stable symmetric steady states. Declare bistability for that $m$ if there are at least two such states.\n- Over the scan, detect contiguous sub-intervals of $m$ values that yield bistability. For the final answer per test case, return either the boolean value False if no $m$ in the scan yields bistability, or the longest contiguous closed sub-interval $[m_{\\min}, m_{\\max}]$ (inclusive of endpoints) where bistability is present.\n- Root finding must be performed on $g(u)$ over the interval $u \\in [0, U_{\\max}]$, where $U_{\\max}$ can be chosen using the bound $U_{\\max} = 2 \\, (s + m) / d$ to ensure coverage of all plausible symmetric steady states.\n\nAll parameters are dimensionless.

Return this interval (with values rounded to three decimal places) or `False` if no such interval exists.\n- **Test Cases**:\n  1. $(s, d, K, n, m_{\\text{low}}, m_{\\text{high}}, \\Delta m) = (0.01, 1.0, 0.5, 2, 0.1, 5.0, 0.01)$\n  2. $(s, d, K, n, m_{\\text{low}}, m_{\\text{high}}, \\Delta m) = (0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 3, 0.1, 10.0, 0.02)$\n  3. $(s, d, K, n, m_{\\text{low}}, m_{\\text{high}}, \\Delta m) = (0.2, 1.0, 0.5, 1, 0.1, 5.0, 0.01)$\n  4. $(s, d, K, n, m_{\\text{low}}, m_{\\text{high}}, \\Delta m) = (0.005, 1.0, 0.25, 4, 0.01, 2.0, 0.005)$\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The model is a classic representation of a genetic toggle switch, a fundamental motif in systems biology. The use of Hill functions to model cooperative transcriptional activation and first-order kinetics for degradation are standard and well-established principles. The model is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The objective is clearly stated, the mathematical framework is complete, and the criteria for success (bistability, output format) are unambiguously defined. The stability condition $a(u) < d$ is correctly derived from the linearization (Jacobian analysis) of the ODE system at a symmetric steady state $(u,u)$, ensuring that both eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix have negative real parts.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is entirely objective, based on the mathematical analysis of a deterministic model. It contains no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem statement is self-contained. All necessary equations, parameters, and constraints for the four test cases are provided. There are no contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-defined, scientifically grounded problem in computational systems biology. I will now proceed to devise and present the solution.\n\n### Solution Methodology\n\nThe program will solve the problem by implementing a numerical search and analysis routine for each test case. The core of the solution is to systematically determine, for each value of the feedback strength $m$ in a specified range, whether the GRN model exhibits bistability.\n\nThe overall algorithm is as follows:\n\n1.  **Iterate through Parameter Space**: For each test case, the program will iterate through the values of the maximal feedback strength $m$ from $m_{\\text{low}}$ to $m_{\\text{high}}$ with a step of $\\Delta m$. A list of these $m$ values is generated.\n\n2.  **Find Steady States**: For each value of $m$, the program must find all non-negative solutions $u$ to the steady-state equation $g(u) = 0$. Since $g(u)$ is a transcendental equation, this requires a numerical root-finding approach. A robust method is employed:\n    - The search domain for roots is defined as $[0, U_{\\max}]$, where $U_{\\max} = 2(s+m)/d$ is a safe upper bound.\n    - This domain is discretized into a fine grid of points.\n    - The function $g(u)$ is evaluated at each grid point. A sign change between two consecutive points indicates the presence of a root in that sub-interval.\n    - For each such sub-interval, a high-precision numerical solver (`scipy.optimize.brentq`) is used to find the exact location of the root. This ensures all roots are found.\n\n3.  **Assess Stability**: Once the set of steady states $\\{u_i\\}$ is found for a given $m$, each steady state is tested for linear stability. A steady state $u_i$ is stable if and only if the condition $a(u_i) < d$ is met. The program calculates $a(u_i)$ and performs this check.\n\n4.  **Identify Bistability**: After checking all steady states for a given $m$, the program counts the number of stable states. If this count is two or greater, the system is classified as bistable for that value of $m$. The result of this check (True/False) is stored for each $m$ in the scan.\n\n5.  **Determine Longest Bistable Interval**: After the scan over all $m$ values is complete, the program analyzes the sequence of bistability flags. It identifies all contiguous blocks of $m$ values for which the system was found to be bistable and determines which of these blocks is the longest.\n\n6.  **Format Output**: If no bistability was found for any $m$ in the scan (e.g., as expected for the case with Hill coefficient $n=1$), the output for that test case is the boolean `False`. Otherwise, the program returns the closed interval $[m_{\\min}, m_{\\max}]$ corresponding to the start and end of the longest contiguous bistable region. The endpoint values $m_{\\min}$ and $m_{\\max}$ are rounded to three decimal places as required. The final output is a single line containing a list of the results for all test cases.\n\nThis procedure provides a rigorous and computationally sound solution to the problem.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import optimize\n\ndef process_case(s, d, K, n, m_low, m_high, delta_m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes one set of parameters to find the longest contiguous interval of\n    bistability for the parameter m.\n\n    Args:\n        s (float): Basal synthesis rate.\n        d (float): Degradation rate.\n        K (float): Activation half-saturation constant.\n        n (int): Hill cooperativity.\n        m_low (float): Start of the scan range for m.\n        m_high (float): End of the scan range for m.\n        delta_m (float): Step size for the m scan.\n\n    Returns:\n        Union[bool, List[float]]: False if no bistability is found, otherwise\n                                  a list [m_min, m_max] for the longest\n                                  bistable interval.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def g(u, m_val, s_val, d_val, K_val, n_val):\n        # Steady-state equation g(u) = 0\n        return s_val + m_val * np.power(u, n_val) / (np.power(K_val, n_val) + np.power(u, n_val)) -

Model one palatal shelf as a homogenous rectangular plate of length $L$, width $w$, and thickness $t$, hinged along its medial edge. Assume that HA-driven hydration generates a uniform pressure $p$ acting normal to the shelf, producing a net elevating moment about the hinge equal to $p \\times A \\times r$, where $A$ is the shelf area and $r$ is the distance from the hinge to the centroid of the loaded area.

The condition for the initiation of elevation is given as the point where the elevating moment equals the sum of the resisting moments.\n\nThe elevating moment, $M_{\\mathrm{elev}}$, is generated by a uniform pressure $p$ acting over the shelf area $A$. The total force is $F_{\\mathrm{elev}} = p\\,A$. This force acts at the centroid of the area, which for a rectangular shelf is at a distance of $r = w/2$ from the hinge. Thus, the elevating moment is:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{elev}} = (p\\,A) \\times \\frac{w}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the area, $A = L\\,w$, we get:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{elev}} = p\\,(L\\,w)\\,\\frac{w}{2}\n$$\n\nThe resisting moments are due to the weight of the shelf (gravity) and the contact force from the tongue.\nThe gravitational moment, $M_g$, is the product of the shelf's weight, $m\\,g$, and the lever arm to its center of mass, which is at $w/2$ for a homogenous plate.\n$$\nM_{g} = (m\\,g)\\,\\frac{w}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the mass, $m = \\rho\\,L\\,w\\,t$:\n$$\nM_{g} = (\\rho\\,L\\,w\\,t\\,g)\\,\\frac{w}{2}\n$$\n\nThe resisting moment from the tongue, $M_t$, is due to the force $F_{\\mathrm{PRS}}$ applied at the distal edge of the shelf, at a lever arm of $r_t = w$:\n$$\nM_{t} = F_{\\mathrm{PRS}}\\,w\n$$\n\nThe threshold condition is the balance of moments:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{elev}} = M_{g} + M_{t}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the moments:\n$$\np\\,(L\\,w)\\,\\frac{w}{2} = (\\rho\\,L\\,w\\,t\\,g)\\,\\frac{w}{2} + F_{\\mathrm{PRS}}\\,w\n$$\nTo solve for the required pressure $p$, we can simplify this equation. We can divide every term by the shelf width $w$, which is non-zero:\n$$\np\\,L\\,\\frac{w}{2} = (\\rho\\,L\\,t\\,g)\\,\\frac{w}{2} + F_{\\mathrm{PRS}}\n$$\nNow, we solve for $p$:\n$$\np = \\frac{(\\rho\\,L\\,t\\,g)\\,\\frac{w}{2} + F_{\\mathrm{PRS}}}{L\\,\\frac{w}{2}} = \\frac{\\rho\\,L\\,t\\,g\\,w/2}{L\\,w/2} + \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{PRS}}}{L\\,w/2}\n$$\n$$\np = \\rho\\,t\\,g + \\frac{2\\,F_{\\mathrm{PRS}}}{L\\,w}\n$$\nThis pressure $p$ is the minimum pressure required to overcome the resisting moments.

From an embryologic standpoint, bilateral choanal atresia results from the persistence of the oronasal (bucconasal) membrane due to incomplete canalization during the posterior displacement of the primitive choanae as the secondary palate forms. Using this developmental base, first reason out what a transnasal endoscopic examination would reveal in bilateral choanal atresia in the immediate newborn period, explicitly relating the visualized structures to their embryologic origins.\n\nThen, idealize each choanal outlet as a rigid, circular cylindrical conduit representing the stenotic segment. Assume steady, incompressible, laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid with no slip at the wall, and that the two nasal passages function as parallel conduits with identical geometry. Starting from the balance of viscous and pressure forces under these assumptions (i.e., without invoking any pre-memorized shortcut formulas), derive the dependence of the hydrodynamic resistance on fluid viscosity, conduit length, and radius for one choanal conduit, and then obtain the effective resistance of the two choanae combined in parallel.\n\nFinally, evaluate the total nasal outlet resistance for air at body temperature with dynamic viscosity $\\mu = 1.9 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$ flowing through two identical stenotic choanal segments, each of length $L = 4.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$ and radius $r = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.

We will first validate the problem statement and then proceed with a structured solution.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid. Its clinical premise regarding bilateral choanal atresia, including the classic presentation of cyclical cyanosis relieved by crying in an obligate nasal breathing neonate, is factually correct. The embryologic basis provided—the persistence of the oronasal membrane—is the accepted scientific explanation. The problem's second and third parts formalize the physiological consequence of this developmental anomaly into a well-posed fluid dynamics problem based on standard, sound physical assumptions (steady, incompressible, laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid), and provides all necessary, physically plausible data for its solution. The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and free from ambiguity or contradiction.\n\nWe will address the three components of the problem in sequence. First, we will correlate the embryology with the expected clinical findings. Second, we will derive the hydrodynamic resistance from first principles. Third, we will calculate the specific resistance for the given parameters.\n\n**Part 1: Embryological Basis and Endoscopic Findings**\n\nThe organogenesis of the nasal passages involves the formation of the primitive choanae through the rupture of the oronasal (or bucconasal) membrane around the sixth week of gestation. This membrane initially separates the primitive nasal cavities from the stomodeum (primitive oral cavity). Subsequent development of the secondary palate displaces these openings posteriorly to their definitive position, forming the junction between the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx. Bilateral choanal atresia results from a failure of this canalization process, where the oronasal membrane persists, either partially (stenosis) or completely (atresia). This persistent tissue is typically bony ($90\\%$) or membranous ($10\\%$) due to the surrounding mesenchymal tissue's ossification.\n\nA transnasal endoscopic examination is the diagnostic standard. Upon introducing an endoscope through an anterior naris of the neonate, the nasal cavity anterior to the obstruction—including structures such as the nasal septum and turbinates—would appear generally normal, though often narrowed. As the endoscope is advanced posteriorly along the floor of the nasal cavity towards the nasopharynx, instead of visualizing an open posterior aperture (the choana) leading into the nasopharyngeal space, the examination would reveal a blind-ending cavity. A distinct, obstructing plate of tissue, which may be pale and firm if bony or translucent if membranous, would be visualized. This structure is the atretic plate itself. This finding directly corresponds to the embryologic failure: the visualized plate is the persistent oronasal membrane that failed to apoptose and canalize, physically blocking the posterior nasal passage at the location of the definitive choana.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Hydrodynamic Resistance**\n\nThe atretic plate or severe stenosis creates a segment of high hydrodynamic resistance. We model this stenotic segment as a rigid, circular cylindrical conduit of length $L$ and radius $r_c$. We assume the flow of air is steady, incompressible, laminar, and that the air behaves as a Newtonian fluid.\n\nTo derive the resistance, we begin from a balance of forces on a cylindrical element of fluid of radius $r$ (where $0 \\leq r \\leq r_c$) and length $L$, coaxial with the conduit. For steady flow, the net force on this fluid element is zero. The forces acting in the direction of flow (the $z$-axis) are the pressure force and the viscous shear force.\n\nThe net pressure force is the product of the pressure difference, $\\Delta P = P_{inlet} - P_{outlet}$, and the cross-sectional area of the element, $\\pi r^2$:\n$$F_{pressure} = \\Delta P \\cdot \\pi r^2$$\nThis force drives the flow in the positive $z$-direction.\n\nThe viscous force is exerted by the adjacent, slower-moving fluid layer (at radii greater than $r$) on the surface of our cylindrical element. This force opposes the motion. It is the product of the shear stress, $\\tau(r)$, at radius $r$, and the surface area of the cylinder, $2\\pi r L$:\n$$F_{viscous} = -\\tau(r) \\cdot 2\\pi r L$$\nFor steady flow, the sum of forces is zero:\n$$\\Delta P \\pi r^2 - \\tau(r) 2\\pi r L = 0$$\nSolving for the shear stress $\\tau(r)$ as a function of radius:\n$$\\tau(r) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2L} r$$\nFor a Newtonian fluid, the shear stress is proportional to the negative velocity gradient, $\\frac{dv_z}{dr}$, where $v_z$ is the axial velocity:\n$$\\tau(r) = -\\mu \\frac{dv_z}{dr}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that velocity decreases as the radius increases from the center. Equating the two expressions for $\\tau(r)$:\n$$-\\mu \\frac{dv_z}{dr} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{2L} r$$\n$$ \\frac{dv_z}{dr} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\mu L} r$$\nTo find the velocity profile $v_z(r)$, we integrate this expression with respect to $r$. We apply the no-slip boundary condition, which states that the fluid velocity is zero at the wall of the conduit, $v_z(r_c) = 0$.\n$$\\int_{v_z(r)}^{v_z(r_c)=0} dv'_z = \\int_{r}^{r_c} -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\mu L} r' dr'$$\n$$0 - v_z(r) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left[ \\frac{r'^2}{2} \\right]_r^{r_c}$$\n$$-v_z(r) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} (r_c^2 - r^2)$$\n$$v_z(r) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} (r_c^2 - r^2)$$\nThis is the characteristic parabolic velocity profile for laminar flow in a pipe.\n\nNext, we calculate the total volumetric flow rate, $Q$, by integrating the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the conduit:\n$$Q = \\int_{0}^{r_c} v_z(r) \\cdot 2\\pi r dr$$\n$$Q = \\int_{0}^{r_c} \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} (r_c^2 - r^2) \\cdot 2\\pi r dr$$\n$$Q = \\frac{2\\pi \\Delta P}{4\\mu L} \\int_{0}^{r_c} (r_c^2 r - r^3) dr$$\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left[ r_c^2 \\frac{r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_0^{r_c}$$\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{r_c^4}{2} - \\frac{r_c^4}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{r_c^4}{4} \\right)$$\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r_c^4}{8\\mu L} \\Delta P$$\nHydrodynamic resistance, $\\mathcal{R}$, is defined by the relation $\\Delta P = Q \\mathcal{R}$. Therefore, the resistance of a single conduit is:\n$$\\mathcal{R}_{single} = \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q} = \\frac{8\\mu L}{\\pi r_c^4}$$\nThis expression shows that the resistance is directly proportional to the fluid viscosity $\\mu$ and the conduit length $L$, and inversely proportional to the fourth power of the conduit radius $r_c$.\n\nThe problem states that the two nasal passages function as identical parallel conduits. For resistors in parallel, the total effective resistance, $\\mathcal{R}_{total}$, is given by:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{R}_{total}} = \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{R}_1} + \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{R}_2}$$\nSince the conduits are identical, $\\mathcal{R}_1 = \\mathcal{R}_2 = \\mathcal{R}_{single}$.\n$$\\frac{1}{\\mathcal{R}_{total}} = \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{R}_{single}} + \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{R}_{single}} = \\frac{2}{\\mathcal{R}_{single}}$$\n$$\\mathcal{R}_{total} = \\frac{\\mathcal{R}_{single}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{8\\mu L}{\\pi r_c^4} \\right) = \\frac{4\\mu L}{\\pi r_c^4}$$\nThis is the final expression for the total resistance of the bilateral stenotic outlets.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the total nasal outlet resistance, $\\mathcal{R}_{total}$, using the derived formula and the provided data. The problem statement uses the variable $r$ for the conduit radius, so we will substitute $r_c$ with $r$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Dynamic viscosity, $\\mu = 1.9 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$\n- Conduit length, $L = 4.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Conduit radius, $r = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nThe formula for the total resistance of the two parallel conduits is:\n$$\\mathcal{R}_{total} = \\frac{4\\mu L}{\\pi r^4}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\mathcal{R}_{total} = \\frac{4 (1.9 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}) (4.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m})}{\\pi (5.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m})^4}$$\nFirst, we evaluate the numerator:\n$$4 \\times (1.9 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{-3}) = 3.04 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s \\cdot m}$$\nNext, we evaluate the denominator:\n$$\\pi (5.0 \\times 10^{-4})^4 = \\pi (5.0^4 \\times 10^{-16}) = \\pi (625 \\times 10^{-16}) = 625\\pi \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\mathrm{m^4}$$\n$$625\\pi \\approx 1963.495...$$\nSo, the denominator is approximately $1.9635 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\mathrm{m^4}$.\n\nNow we compute the final value of the resistance:\n$$\\mathcal{R}_{total} = \\frac{3.04 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s \\cdot m}}{1.9635 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\mathrm{m^4}} \\approx 1.5482 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s \\cdot m^{-3}}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested:\n$$\\mathcal{R}_{total} \\approx 1.55 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s \\cdot m^{-3}}$$\nThis value quantifies the high resistance to airflow posed by the bilateral stenotic choanae, explaining the profound respiratory distress observed clinically.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.55 \\times 10^6}$$", "id": "5055408"}]}
