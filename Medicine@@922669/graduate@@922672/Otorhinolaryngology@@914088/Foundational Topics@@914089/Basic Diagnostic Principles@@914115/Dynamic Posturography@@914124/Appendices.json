This is achieved by calculating standardized sensory ratios, which are designed to isolate and quantify the patient's ability to use their somatosensory, visual, and vestibular systems for balance.

The SOT comprises six conditions that systematically remove or distort sensory inputs to standing balance: condition $1$ (eyes open, fixed support and fixed surround), condition $2$ (eyes closed, fixed support), condition $3$ (sway-referenced visual surround, eyes open), condition $4$ (sway-referenced support, eyes open), condition $5$ (sway-referenced support, eyes closed), and condition $6$ (sway-referenced support and sway-referenced visual surround, eyes open). Each condition is repeated three times, producing equilibrium scores on a $0$ to $100$ scale for each trial, where higher values indicate less sway.\n\nYou are provided with the raw equilibrium scores for the three trials in each condition, in the order of trials $1$ through $3$:\n\n- Condition $1$: $92$, $94$, $93$.\n- Condition $2$: $91$, $90$, $89$.\n- Condition $3$: $85$, $80$, $82$.\n- Condition $4$: $74$, $70$, $72$.\n- Condition $5$: $52$, $55$, $50$.\n- Condition $6$: $48$, $45$, $44$.\n\nStarting from the conceptual purpose of each condition and the principle that isolating a sensory contribution requires comparing performance when that sensory input is available versus removed or rendered inaccurate, derive expressions for the canonical sensory ratios used in sensory analysis of the SOT: somatosensory, visual, vestibular, and visual preference. Then compute these ratios from the data by first averaging the three trials within each condition to obtain a single equilibrium score per condition.\n\nUsing widely adopted adult normative criteria for ages $20$ through $59$ years, interpret the resulting ratios as normal or reduced capacity for each sensory modality. For definiteness, use the following empirically established cutoffs for normal performance in this age range: somatosensory ratio $\\geq 0.90$, visual ratio $\\geq 0.78$, vestibular ratio $\\geq 0.58$, and visual preference ratio $\\geq 0.75$.\n\nFinally, classify the patient’s sensory dependence profile in words based on which ratios are reduced versus normal.\n\nAnswer specification:\n- Report your final numeric answer as the vestibular ratio only, expressed as a dimensionless value, rounded to four significant figures.\n- Provide all intermediate derivations, ratios, and the classification in your solution, but only the vestibular ratio should be reported as the final numeric answer.", "solution": "The problem requires a thorough analysis of a patient's Sensory Organization Test (SOT) data, including the derivation of standard sensory ratios, their computation, and the clinical interpretation of the results based on provided normative data.\n\nThe first step is to formalize the problem by calculating the mean equilibrium score for each of the six conditions from the three trial scores provided. Let $\\bar{S}_i$ be the average score for Condition $i$.\n\nThe average score for Condition $1$ is:\n$$ \\bar{S}_1 = \\frac{92 + 94 + 93}{3} = \\frac{279}{3} = 93 $$\n\nThe average score for Condition $2$ is:\n$$ \\bar{S}_2 = \\frac{91 + 90 + 89}{3} = \\frac{270}{3} = 90 $$\n\nThe average score for Condition $3$ is:\n$$ \\bar{S}_3 = \\frac{85 + 80 + 82}{3} = \\frac{247}{3} \\approx 82.333 $$\n\nThe average score for Condition $4$ is:\n$$ \\bar{S}_4 = \\frac{74 + 70 + 72}{3} = \\frac{216}{3} = 72 $$\n\nThe average score for Condition $5$ is:\n$$ \\bar{S}_5 = \\frac{52 + 55 + 50}{3} = \\frac{157}{3} \\approx 52.333 $$\n\nThe average score for Condition $6$ is:\n$$ \\bar{S}_6 = \\frac{48 + 45 + 44}{3} = \\frac{137}{3} \\approx 45.667 $$\n\nNext, we derive the expressions for the four canonical sensory ratios. These ratios are designed to isolate the functional contribution of each sensory system (somatosensory, visual, vestibular) by comparing performance across conditions where specific sensory inputs are systematically altered. Condition $1$ ($\\bar{S}_1$), where all sensory inputs are accurate, serves as the optimal performance baseline for all comparisons.\n\n**1. Somatosensory (SOM) Ratio:**\nThis ratio assesses the patient's ability to use somatosensory information from the feet and joints to maintain balance. It compares performance with accurate somatosensory input but absent visual input (Condition $2$) to the baseline performance (Condition $1$).\n- In Condition $1$, the patient uses somatosensory, visual, and vestibular inputs.\n- In Condition $2$, the patient is denied visual input (eyes closed) and must rely on somatosensory and vestibular inputs.\nA high ratio indicates that the removal of vision does not significantly degrade performance, implying effective use of the somatosensory system.\nThe expression is:\n$$ \\text{SOM Ratio} = \\frac{\\bar{S}_2}{\\bar{S}_1} $$\n\n**2. Visual (VIS) Ratio:**\nThis ratio assesses the patient's ability to use visual information to maintain balance when somatosensory input is made unreliable. It compares performance with accurate visual input but inaccurate somatosensory input (Condition $4$) to the baseline (Condition $1$).\n- In Condition $1$, all inputs are accurate.\n- In Condition $4$, the support surface is sway-referenced, making somatosensory information unreliable. The patient must rely more heavily on visual and vestibular inputs.\nA high ratio suggests that vision is effectively used to compensate for the unreliable somatosensory information.\nThe expression is:\n$$ \\text{VIS Ratio} = \\frac{\\bar{S}_4}{\\bar{S}_1} $$\n\n**3. Vestibular (VEST) Ratio:**\nThis ratio quantifies the patient's ability to use vestibular information alone to maintain balance. It is the most direct measure of vestibular function in the SOT. It compares performance when both visual input is absent (eyes closed) and somatosensory input is unreliable (sway-referenced support), as in Condition $5$, to the baseline (Condition $1$).\n- In Condition $5$, the patient is essentially left with only the vestibular system as a reliable source of orientation information.\nA high ratio indicates a robust vestibular system capable of maintaining postural control independently.\nThe expression is:\n$$ \\text{VEST Ratio} = \\frac{\\bar{S}_5}{\\bar{S}_1} $$\n\n**4. Visual Preference (PREF) Ratio:**\nThis ratio, also known as the visual conflict ratio, assesses the degree to which a patient inappropriately relies on conflicting visual information. It compares performance in conditions with inaccurate visual input (Conditions $3$ and $6$) to performance in conditions with no visual input (Conditions $2$ and $5$).\n- Numerator: Performance with inaccurate vision (sway-referenced surround) under both stable ($\\bar{S}_3$) and unstable ($\\bar{S}_6$) support.\n- Denominator: Performance with no vision (eyes closed) under both stable ($\\bar{S}_2$) and unstable ($\\bar{S}_5$) support.\nA ratio close to $1$ indicates the patient successfully ignores the misleading visual information, performing as if their eyes were closed. A low ratio suggests a maladaptive preference for visual input, even when it is erroneous.\nThe expression is:\n$$ \\text{PREF Ratio} = \\frac{\\bar{S}_3 + \\bar{S}_6}{\\bar{S}_2 + \\bar{S}_5} $$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values for these ratios using the calculated average scores:\n\n$$ \\text{SOM Ratio} = \\frac{90}{93} \\approx 0.9677 $$\n$$ \\text{VIS Ratio} = \\frac{72}{93} \\approx 0.7742 $$\n$$ \\text{VEST Ratio} = \\frac{157/3}{93} = \\frac{157}{279} \\approx 0.5627 $$\n$$ \\text{PREF Ratio} = \\frac{247/3 + 137/3}{90 + 157/3} = \\frac{(247+137)/3}{(270+157)/3} = \\frac{384}{427} \\approx 0.8993 $$\n\nFinally, we interpret these results by comparing them to the provided normative cutoffs for the patient's age group ($20-59$ years).\n- Somatosensory Ratio: $0.9677 \\geq 0.90$. This is within the normal range.\n- Visual Ratio: $0.7742 < 0.78$. This is reduced, indicating difficulty using visual cues when somatosensory input is unreliable.\n- Vestibular Ratio: $0.5627 < 0.58$. This is reduced, indicating a vestibular deficit. The patient has difficulty maintaining balance when reliant solely on vestibular input.\n- Visual Preference Ratio: $0.8993 \\geq 0.75$. This is normal, indicating the patient can appropriately suppress conflicting visual information.\n\n**Classification of Sensory Dependence Profile:**\nThe patient demonstrates a normal ability to utilize somatosensory information and to suppress inaccurate visual information. However, the analysis reveals two key deficits:\n1.  A reduced vestibular ratio, which is the hallmark of a **vestibular system deficit**. The patient struggles to maintain balance when both visual and somatosensory cues are compromised, pointing to an impairment in the vestibular system's contribution to postural control.\n2.  A reduced visual ratio, which indicates difficulty in using vision to compensate for unreliable somatosensory feedback.\n\nThe combination of a reduced vestibular ratio and a reduced visual ratio with a normal somatosensory ratio points to a profile often classified as a **vestibular deficit pattern**. The primary dysfunction lies within the vestibular system, and the patient is also unable to effectively use their visual system to compensate for balance challenges involving somatosensory disruption.\n\nThe problem asks for the vestibular ratio as the final numerical answer, rounded to four significant figures.\nVestibular Ratio $\\approx 0.5627239...$\nRounded to four significant figures, the value is $0.5627$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5627}\n$$", "id": "5021655"}, {"introduction": "While sensory ratios provide a high-level functional summary, a graduate-level understanding of posturography requires grasping the underlying biomechanics.

It is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The provided data are physically plausible for human quiet stance. The required steps are clearly defined and lead to a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Governing Relation\nWe model the subject as a point mass $m$ at the COM, located at a height $h$ above the ankle pivot. The horizontal position of the COM is $x_{\\mathrm{COM}}(t)$. The external forces acting on the body are gravity and the ground reaction force (GRF). The GRF is applied at the COP, $x_{\\mathrm{COP}}(t)$, and can be decomposed into a horizontal (shear) component, $F_x$, and a vertical component, $F_z$.\n\nAccording to Newton's second law for the horizontal motion of the COM:\n$$ \\sum F_{\\mathrm{horizontal}} = F_x = m \\ddot{x}_{\\mathrm{COM}}(t) $$\nThe problem states that during quiet stance, the vertical GRF is approximately equal to body weight, i.e., $F_z \\approx mg$.\n\nTo find the relation between $x_{\\mathrm{COP}}$ and $x_{\\mathrm{COM}}$, we apply the principle of rotational dynamics. The most direct approach is to sum the torques about the COM. For a point mass, the moment of inertia about its own center of mass, $I_{\\mathrm{COM}}$, is zero. Therefore, the net torque about the COM must be zero.\n$$ \\sum \\tau_{\\mathrm{COM}} = 0 $$\nThe gravitational force, $\\vec{F}_g = -mg\\hat{j}$, acts at the COM, so it produces no torque about the COM. The only other external force is the GRF, $\\vec{F}_{\\mathrm{GRF}} = F_x \\hat{i} + F_z \\hat{j}$, which acts at the COP. The position vector from the COM to the COP is $\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{COP/COM}} = (x_{\\mathrm{COP}} - x_{\\mathrm{COM}})\\hat{i} - h\\hat{j}$.\n\nThe torque generated by the GRF about the COM is:\n$$ \\vec{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{GRF}} = \\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{COP/COM}} \\times \\vec{F}_{\\mathrm{GRF}} = \\left[(x_{\\mathrm{COP}} - x_{\\mathrm{COM}})\\hat{i} - h\\hat{j}\\right] \\times \\left[F_x \\hat{i} + F_z \\hat{j}\\right] $$\n$$ \\vec{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{GRF}} = (x_{\\mathrm{COP}} - x_{\\mathrm{COM}})F_z (\\hat{i}\\times\\hat{j}) - h F_x (\\hat{j}\\times\\hat{i}) $$\nUsing $\\hat{i}\\times\\hat{j} = \\hat{k}$ and $\\hat{j}\\times\\hat{i} = -\\hat{k}$:\n$$ \\vec{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{GRF}} = \\left[(x_{\\mathrm{COP}} - x_{\\mathrm{COM}})F_z + h F_x\\right]\\hat{k} $$\nSince $\\sum \\vec{\\tau}_{\\mathrm{COM}} = 0$, the scalar component must be zero:\n$$ (x_{\\mathrm{COP}} - x_{\\mathrm{COM}})F_z + h F_x = 0 $$\nSubstituting $F_z = mg$ and $F_x = m \\ddot{x}_{\\mathrm{COM}}$:\n$$ (x_{\\mathrm{COP}} - x_{\\mathrm{COM}})mg + h m \\ddot{x}_{\\mathrm{COM}} = 0 $$\nDividing by $mg$:\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{COP}} - x_{\\mathrm{COM}} + \\frac{h}{g}\\ddot{x}_{\\mathrm{COM}} = 0 $$\nRearranging gives the governing relation:\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{COP}}(t) = x_{\\mathrm{COM}}(t) - \\frac{h}{g}\\ddot{x}_{\\mathrm{COM}}(t) $$\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Estimated COM Trajectory\nWe are given $x_{\\mathrm{COP}}(t)$ and must find the model-based estimate $x_{\\mathrm{COM,est}}(t)$. This requires solving the second-order ordinary differential equation derived above for $x_{\\mathrm{COM}}(t)$:\n$$ \\ddot{x}_{\\mathrm{COM}}(t) - \\frac{g}{h}x_{\\mathrm{COM}}(t) = -\\frac{g}{h}x_{\\mathrm{COP}}(t) $$\nThe input is sinusoidal: $x_{\\mathrm{COP}}(t) = A_{\\mathrm{COP}} \\sin(\\omega t)$, where $\\omega=2\\pi f$. We seek a steady-state particular solution of the form $x_{\\mathrm{COM,est}}(t) = A_{\\mathrm{est}} \\sin(\\omega t)$. The derivatives are:\n$$ \\dot{x}_{\\mathrm{COM,est}}(t) = A_{\\mathrm{est}}\\omega \\cos(\\omega t) $$\n$$ \\ddot{x}_{\\mathrm{COM,est}}(t) = -A_{\\mathrm{est}}\\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega t) $$\nSubstituting into the differential equation:\n$$ -A_{\\mathrm{est}}\\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega t) - \\frac{g}{h}A_{\\mathrm{est}}\\sin(\\omega t) = -\\frac{g}{h}A_{\\mathrm{COP}}\\sin(\\omega t) $$\nThe term $\\sin(\\omega t)$ is common to all terms and can be cancelled:\n$$ -A_{\\mathrm{est}}\\omega^2 - \\frac{g}{h}A_{\\mathrm{est}} = -\\frac{g}{h}A_{\\mathrm{COP}} $$\nSolving for the estimated amplitude $A_{\\mathrm{est}}$:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{est}}\\left(\\omega^2 + \\frac{g}{h}\\right) = A_{\\mathrm{COP}}\\frac{g}{h} $$\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{est}} = A_{\\mathrm{COP}} \\frac{g/h}{\\omega^2 + g/h} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{COP}}}{1 + \\frac{h\\omega^2}{g}} $$\nThus, the model-based estimate of the COM trajectory is:\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{COM,est}}(t) = \\left(\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{COP}}}{1 + \\frac{h(2\\pi f)^2}{g}}\\right) \\sin(2\\pi f t) $$\n\n### Step 4: Calculation of the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE)\nThe RMSE is defined as $\\mathrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T}\\left(x_{\\mathrm{COM,est}}(t)-x_{\\mathrm{COM,mocap}}(t)\\right)^{2}\\,dt}$.\nThe difference between the estimated and measured COM trajectories is:\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{COM,est}}(t) - x_{\\mathrm{COM,mocap}}(t) = A_{\\mathrm{est}}\\sin(\\omega t) - A_{\\mathrm{mocap}}\\sin(\\omega t) = (A_{\\mathrm{est}} - A_{\\mathrm{mocap}})\\sin(\\omega t) $$\nThe squared error is $(A_{\\mathrm{est}} - A_{\\mathrm{mocap}})^2 \\sin^2(\\omega t)$. The integral of $\\sin^2(\\omega t)$ over one period $T=2\\pi/\\omega$ is $T/2$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T} \\sin^2(\\omega t) dt = \\int_{0}^{T} \\frac{1-\\cos(2\\omega t)}{2} dt = \\left[\\frac{t}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2\\omega t)}{4\\omega}\\right]_0^T = \\frac{T}{2} $$\nSubstituting this into the RMSE formula:\n$$ \\mathrm{RMSE}^2 = \\frac{1}{T} (A_{\\mathrm{est}} - A_{\\mathrm{mocap}})^2 \\int_{0}^{T} \\sin^2(\\omega t) dt = \\frac{1}{T} (A_{\\mathrm{est}} - A_{\\mathrm{mocap}})^2 \\frac{T}{2} = \\frac{(A_{\\mathrm{est}} - A_{\\mathrm{mocap}})^2}{2} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{RMSE} = \\frac{|A_{\\mathrm{est}} - A_{\\mathrm{mocap}}|}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\n### Step 5: Numerical Computation\nFirst, we compute the numerical value of $A_{\\mathrm{est}}$.

Derivation and Analysis**\n\n**Part 1: Computation of Equilibrium Scores**\n\nThe equilibrium score $E$ is calculated for each trial using the formula $E = 100 \\left( \\dfrac{12.5^\\circ - \\theta_{\\max}}{12.5^\\circ} \\right)$.\n\n*   **Condition 2 (C2):**\n    *   Trial $1$: $\\theta_{\\max} = 9.5^\\circ \\implies E_1 = 100 \\left( \\dfrac{12.5 - 9.5}{12.5} \\right) = 100 \\left( \\dfrac{3.0}{12.5} \\right) = 24.0$.\n    *   Trial $2$: Fall $\\implies E_2 = 0$.\n    *   Trial $3$: $\\theta_{\\max} = 10.2^\\circ \\implies E_3 = 100 \\left( \\dfrac{12.5 - 10.2}{12.5} \\right) = 100 \\left( \\dfrac{2.3}{12.5} \\right) = 18.4$.\n    *   Mean Score for C$2$: $\\bar{E}_{C2} = \\dfrac{24.0 + 0 + 18.4}{3} = \\dfrac{42.4}{3} \\approx 14.13$.\n\n*   **Condition 5 (C5):**\n    *   Trial $1$: $\\theta_{\\max} = 4.0^\\circ \\implies E_1 = 100 \\left( \\dfrac{12.5 - 4.0}{12.5} \\right) = 100 \\left( \\dfrac{8.5}{12.5} \\right) = 68.0$.\n    *   Trial $2$: $\\theta_{\\max} = 5.1^\\circ \\implies E_2 = 100 \\left( \\dfrac{12.5 - 5.1}{12.5} \\right) = 100 \\left( \\dfrac{7.4}{12.5} \\right) = 59.2$.\n    *   Trial $3$: $\\theta_{\\max} = 5.0^\\circ \\implies E_3 = 100 \\left( \\dfrac{12.5 - 5.0}{12.5} \\right) = 100 \\left( \\dfrac{7.5}{12.5} \\right) = 60.0$.\n    *   Mean Score for C$5$: $\\bar{E}_{C5} = \\dfrac{68.0 + 59.2 + 60.0}{3} = \\dfrac{187.2}{3} = 62.4$.\n\nThe calculations confirm the premise: the mean C$2$ score ($\\approx 14$) is substantially lower than the mean C$5$ score ($62.4$). This pattern is atypical because C$2$ provides reliable somatosensory information ($T_s \\approx 0.05\\,\\text{s}$), which is a faster and generally more precise sensory channel for controlling posture than the vestibular system ($T_v \\approx 0.10\\,\\text{s}$), which must be relied upon in C$5$.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of the Atypical Pattern**\n\nThe key to understanding the pattern lies in the additional observational data provided. A central piece of evidence is the \"foot-pressure mapping during Condition $2$\" which \"shows repeated heel lift\".\n\nLet's analyze the biomechanical consequences of this heel lift. The geometric limit of stability, $\\theta_{\\text{lim}}$, is the maximum sway angle before the center of mass (CoM) projects outside the base of support (BOS), leading to a fall. It is given by $\\theta_{\\text{lim}} \\approx \\arctan\\!\\left(\\dfrac{r}{h}\\right)$.\n\n*   **Stability Limit with Normal Stance (C5):**\n    The patient \"maintained heel contact throughout\" C$5$. The BOS half-length is $r \\approx 0.12\\,\\text{m}$ and CoM height is $h = 1.0\\,\\text{m}$.\n    $$ \\theta_{\\text{lim, normal}} \\approx \\arctan\\left(\\frac{0.12}{1.0}\\right) \\approx 0.1194\\,\\text{rad} \\approx 6.84^\\circ $$\n    In C$5$, the peak sway angles were $4.0^\\circ$, $5.1^\\circ$, and $5.0^\\circ$. These are all within the normal geometric stability limit of $\\approx 6.84^\\circ$. This is consistent with the observation of \"zero tension during Condition $5$\" in the harness, as the patient never swayed to the point of requiring external support.\n\n*   **Stability Limit with Heel Lift (C2):**\n    During C$2$, the patient exhibited heel lift, reducing the effective BOS half-length to that of the forefoot, $r' \\approx 0.06\\,\\text{m}$.\n    $$ \\theta_{\\text{lim, reduced}} \\approx \\arctan\\left(\\frac{0.06}{1.0}\\right) \\approx 0.0599\\,\\text{rad} \\approx 3.43^\\circ $$\n    This is a dramatic reduction in the stability margin. The measured peak sway angles in C$2$ were $9.5^\\circ$ and $10.2^\\circ$. Both of these values are far greater than the reduced stability limit of $\\approx 3.43^\\circ$. Swaying to these angles is mechanically unstable and would result in a fall unless arrested by an external force or a change in strategy (like taking a step). The observation of \"intermittent non-zero tension\" on the harness load cells during C$2$ provides direct evidence that the patient was indeed falling and being caught by the safety harness. The fall recorded in Trial $2$ is the ultimate consequence of exceeding this reduced stability limit.\n\nThis analysis shows that the patient adopted a maladaptive motor strategy (heel lift) specifically during C$2$. This self-induced mechanical instability, a form of test artifact, is the direct cause of the poor performance, large sway angles, and falls. Despite the more favorable sensory conditions in C$2$ (shorter delay), the patient's performance is crippled by a severely compromised biomechanical foundation. Conversely, in the sensorially more challenging C$5$, the patient uses a mechanically stable stance, allowing their intact vestibular system to maintain balance effectively, even with its longer processing delay. The observation that sway-referencing was nominal in C$5$ confirms that the equipment was not at fault and did not make the condition artificially easy.\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. A test artifact due to stance alteration (heel lift) during Condition 2 that reduced the base of support and geometric stability limits, producing disproportionately poor Condition 2 scores despite intact sway-referencing in Condition 5.**\n    This option aligns perfectly with our analysis. The \"stance alteration (heel lift)\" is a documented observation. Our calculations confirm it \"reduced the base of support and geometric stability limits\" significantly (from $\\approx 6.84^\\circ$ to $\\approx 3.43^\\circ$). This reduction is the direct cause of the \"disproportionately poor Condition 2 scores\". The phrase \"despite intact sway-referencing in Condition 5\" correctly rules out an alternative explanation involving equipment malfunction. This is a comprehensive and accurate explanation based on the provided data.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. A central vestibular preference that improves performance when vestibular cues dominate, making Condition 5 appropriately better than Condition 2 without any test artifact.**\n    This is inconsistent with control theory principles stated in the problem (\"larger delays increase closed-loop sway variance\"). Relying on the vestibular system with its longer delay ($T_v \\approx 0.10\\,\\text{s}$) should lead to more sway, not less, compared to a condition utilizing the faster somatosensory system ($T_s \\approx 0.05\\,\\text{s}$). Furthermore, this option explicitly denies the presence of a test artifact, directly contradicting the crucial evidence of heel lift in C$2$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Peripheral vestibular hypofunction, which paradoxically reduces sway when somatosensory cues are unreliable, explaining better performance in Condition 5.**\n    Peripheral vestibular hypofunction would mean the patient has a deficient vestibular system. In C$5$, where the vestibular system is the primary reliable sense for balance, this would lead to extremely poor performance and likely falls. The idea of a \"paradoxical\" reduction in sway is physiologically unfounded. The patient's good performance in C$5$ argues against vestibular hypofunction.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Visual dependence, which explains worse eyes-closed performance specifically in Condition 2 relative to Condition 5 and does not require any test artifact.**\n    Both C$2$ and C$5$ are eyes-closed conditions. Visual dependence causes poor performance when vision is removed, but it does not provide a reason for C$2$ to be worse than C$5$. If anything, a visually dependent person would be expected to perform even more poorly in C$5$, where both visual and reliable somatosensory inputs are unavailable. This option also incorrectly dismisses the documented test artifact.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Cerebellar ataxia, which would primarily and selectively depress Condition 2 while sparing Condition 5, consistent with the observed pattern.**\n    Cerebellar dysfunction typically impairs the ability to coordinate and process sensory information, leading to ataxia (uncoordinated movement and sway). This impairment would be expected to manifest in all challenging sensory conditions, and it is highly unlikely to \"selectively depress\" the easier C$2$ while \"sparing\" the more difficult C$5$. The observed pattern is not characteristic of cerebellar ataxia. The mechanical explanation is far more direct and parsimonious.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn conclusion, the most plausible interpretation is that the patient's poor performance in Condition $2$ is not due to a central processing failure or sensory deficit, but rather a maladaptive motor strategy—a test artifact—that makes the task mechanically untenable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5021648"}]}
