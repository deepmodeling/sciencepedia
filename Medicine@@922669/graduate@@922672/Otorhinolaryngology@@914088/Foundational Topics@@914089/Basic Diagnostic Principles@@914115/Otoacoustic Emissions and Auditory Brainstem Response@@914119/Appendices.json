For each single trial $i$, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$, the recorded waveform at the time of interest for wave V, denoted as $x_i$, is a superposition of a time-locked, deterministic signal component $s$ and an additive, random noise component $n_i$.\n$$x_i = s + n_i$$\nThe signal amplitude is given as $A_s$, which we can associate with the value of $s$. The noise $n_i$ is a random variable with the following properties:\n1.  Zero-mean: $E[n_i] = 0$.\n2.  Constant variance: $Var(n_i) = E[n_i^2] - (E[n_i])^2 = E[n_i^2] = \\sigma^2$. The standard deviation is $\\sqrt{\\sigma^2} = \\sigma$.\n3.  Independence across trials: $E[n_i n_j] = 0$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\nThe single-trial signal-to-noise ratio, which we will denote as $SNR_{\\text{single}}$, is defined as the ratio of the signal amplitude to the noise standard deviation.\n$$SNR_{\\text{single}} = \\frac{A_s}{\\sigma}$$\n\nThe system computes the arithmetic mean of $N$ such trials. Let $\\bar{x}$ be the resulting averaged waveform value.\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (s + n_i)$$\nWe can separate the signal and noise components in the averaged waveform:\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s + \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i$$\nSince the signal $s$ is deterministic and constant across all $N$ trials:\n$$\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s = \\frac{1}{N} (N \\cdot s) = s$$\nThe noise component of the averaged waveform is $\\bar{n} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i$.\nTherefore, the averaged waveform is $\\bar{x} = s + \\bar{n}$.\n\nTo find the $SNR$ of the averaged waveform, $SNR_{\\text{avg}}$, we need to determine its signal amplitude and its noise standard deviation.\nThe signal component of the averaged waveform is $s$, so its amplitude, $A_{s, \\text{avg}}$, is simply the original signal amplitude, $A_s$.\n$$A_{s, \\text{avg}} = A_s$$\n\nNext, we must find the standard deviation of the averaged noise, $\\bar{n}$.

This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we are given the following values:\n-   Single-trial $SNR$: $SNR_{\\text{single}} = 0.2$\n-   Detection criterion (required averaged $SNR$): $SNR_{\\text{avg}} \\ge 3$\n\nWe need to find the minimal integer $N$ that satisfies this condition.
