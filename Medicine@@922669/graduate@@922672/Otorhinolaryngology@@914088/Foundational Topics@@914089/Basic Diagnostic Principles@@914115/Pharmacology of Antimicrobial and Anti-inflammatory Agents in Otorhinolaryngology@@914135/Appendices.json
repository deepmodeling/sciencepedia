The drug is a monoprotic weak base, denoted as $\\mathrm{B}$.\n\nThe problem is approached from first principles, using the definitions of chemical equilibrium and mass balance.\n\nThe dissociation of the drug's conjugate acid, $\\mathrm{BH}^{+}$, in the aqueous fluid of the external auditory canal is described by the following equilibrium:\n$$ \\mathrm{BH}^{+} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{B} + \\mathrm{H}^{+} $$\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, for this reaction is defined by the activities of the species at equilibrium. Assuming the activity coefficients for the drug species are unity, we can use molar concentrations:\n$$ K_a = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}] a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]} $$\nwhere $[\\mathrm{B}]$ is the molar concentration of the unionized base, $[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]$ is the molar concentration of the protonated conjugate acid, and $a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$ is the activity of hydrogen ions. The definition of $\\mathrm{pH}$ is based on this activity: $\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}(a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}})$.\n\nThe total concentration of the drug in the solution, $C_{total}$, is the sum of the concentrations of both the unionized and ionized forms. This is the principle of mass balance:\n$$ C_{total} = [\\mathrm{B}] + [\\mathrm{BH}^{+}] $$\nThe quantity of interest is the fraction of the drug in its unionized base form, which we denote as $f_{\\mathrm{B}}$. This fraction is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the unionized base to the total drug concentration:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{C_{total}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{B}] + [\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]} $$\nTo express $f_{\\mathrm{B}}$ in terms of the given parameters, we first rearrange the expression for $K_a$ to solve for $[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{BH}^{+}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}] a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}}{K_a} $$\nNext, we substitute this expression for $[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]$ into the denominator of the equation for $f_{\\mathrm{B}}$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{B}] + \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}] a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}}{K_a}} $$\nFactoring out $[\\mathrm{B}]$ from the denominator yields:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{B}] \\left( 1 + \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}}{K_a} \\right)} $$\nAssuming a non-zero drug concentration ($[\\mathrm{B}] \\neq 0$), we can cancel the $[\\mathrm{B}]$ term from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}}{K_a}} $$\nThis expression gives the fraction of unionized base in terms of the hydrogen ion activity and the acid dissociation constant. We can convert this to a more convenient form using the definitions of $\\mathrm{pH}$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_a$:\n$$ a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}} $$\n$$ K_a = 10^{-\\mathrm{p}K_a} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $f_{\\mathrm{B}}$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}}{10^{-\\mathrm{p}K_a}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-\\mathrm{pH} + \\mathrm{p}K_a}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\mathrm{p}K_a - \\mathrm{pH}}} $$\nThis is the final derived expression for the fraction of unionized base.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given values: $\\mathrm{pH} = 4.50$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_a = 6.50$.\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{6.50 - 4.50}} $$\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{2.00}} $$\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 100} $$\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{1}{101} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{B}} \\approx 0.00990099... $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0.009901 $$\n\nThe final part of the problem asks for a justification of how this fraction informs drug penetration. Drug transport across biological membranes, such as the lipid-rich stratum corneum of the skin in the external ear canal, occurs primarily via passive diffusion for lipophilic molecules. According to the pH-partition hypothesis, only the unionized, uncharged form of a drug is sufficiently lipid-soluble (lipophilic) to readily cross these lipid barriers. The ionized, charged form ($\\mathrm{BH}^{+}$) is hydrophilic and has very poor membrane permeability. Therefore, the rate and extent of drug penetration through the stratum corneum are directly proportional to the concentration of the unionized species, $\\mathrm{B}$. The calculated fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{B}} \\approx 0.009901$ (or approximately $1\\%$), is very low. This indicates that at the therapeutically acidified $\\mathrm{pH}$ of $4.50$, over $99\\%$ of the imidazole antifungal exists in its protonated, ionized form ($\\mathrm{BH}^{+}$), which is largely unable to penetrate the tissue. Consequently, despite the acidic environment being hostile to the fungus, it severely limits the transdermal delivery of the drug, potentially reducing its efficacy at deeper sites of infection. A higher fraction of unionized base would be expected to lead to more effective drug penetration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.009901}$$", "id": "5060546"}, {"introduction": "Once a drug enters systemic circulation, its concentration must be maintained within a therapeutic range to be effective.

This peak concentration is the sum of the residual concentration from previous doses and the concentration increase from the new dose. It is given by:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{max,ss}} = \\frac{\\text{effective dose}}{V} \\times (\\text{accumulation factor}) = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{V} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)}$$\nHere, $F \\cdot D$ is the bioavailable dose that reaches the systemic circulation.\n\nThe free (unbound) drug concentration, $C_u(t)$, is the product of the total concentration and the unbound fraction, $f_u$:\n$$C_u(t) = f_u \\cdot C(t) = f_u \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{max,ss}} \\exp(-k_e t)$$\n\nThe pharmacodynamic target is $fT>MIC = 0.50$.
