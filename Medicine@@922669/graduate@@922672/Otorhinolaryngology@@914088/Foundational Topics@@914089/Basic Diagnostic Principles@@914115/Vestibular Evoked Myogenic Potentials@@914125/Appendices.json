Consider a cervical VEMP paradigm in which each accepted sweep is modeled at a fixed latency $t_{0}$ (corresponding to a known deterministic feature of the evoked response) as a scalar observation $x_{i}(t_{0}) = s(t_{0}) + n_{i}(t_{0})$, where $s(t_{0})$ is the stimulus-locked deterministic response amplitude at $t_{0}$ that is identical across sweeps, and $n_{i}(t_{0})$ is the random noise contribution at $t_{0}$ for sweep $i$.

The model is a standard and effective simplification used in biomedical engineering and neuroscience to describe the improvement of signal quality with averaging.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe first task is to determine the dependence of the ensemble-averaged Signal-to-Noise Ratio, $\\mathrm{SNR}_{N}$, on the number of sweeps, $N$. The definition is given as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR}_{N} = \\frac{|s(t_{0})|}{\\sigma_{\\bar{n},N}}\n$$\nThe signal component, $s(t_{0})$, is deterministic and constant. Therefore, its magnitude $|s(t_{0})|$ is also constant. The core of the derivation is to find the standard deviation of the averaged noise, $\\sigma_{\\bar{n},N}$, as a function of $N$.\n\nThe averaged noise, $\\bar{n}_{N}(t_{0})$, is defined as:\n$$\n\\bar{n}_{N}(t_{0}) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_{i}(t_{0})\n$$\nThe standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\bar{n},N}$ is the square root of the variance of this quantity, $\\mathrm{Var}[\\bar{n}_{N}(t_{0})]$. We compute the variance using the properties of the variance operator.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}[\\bar{n}_{N}(t_{0})] = \\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_{i}(t_{0})\\right]\n$$\nUsing the property $\\mathrm{Var}[cY] = c^2 \\mathrm{Var}[Y]$ for a constant $c$ and random variable $Y$, we can factor out the $\\frac{1}{N}$ term:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}[\\bar{n}_{N}(t_{0})] = \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_{i}(t_{0})\\right] = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_{i}(t_{0})\\right]\n$$\nThe problem states that the noise contributions $\\{n_{i}(t_{0})\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ are independent. For independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_{i}(t_{0})\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathrm{Var}[n_{i}(t_{0})]\n$$\nWe are given that the variance of the noise in any single sweep is constant, $\\mathrm{Var}[n_{i}(t_{0})] = \\sigma^2$. Therefore, the sum of variances is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathrm{Var}[n_{i}(t_{0})] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sigma^2 = N \\sigma^2\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the variance of the averaged noise:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}[\\bar{n}_{N}(t_{0})] = \\frac{1}{N^2} (N \\sigma^2) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{N}\n$$\nThe standard deviation of the averaged noise, $\\sigma_{\\bar{n},N}$, is the square root of this variance:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\bar{n},N} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{N}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}\n$$\nThis result shows that the standard deviation of the noise in the averaged waveform decreases by a factor of $\\sqrt{N}$. Now, we substitute this expression for $\\sigma_{\\bar{n},N}$ back into the definition of $\\mathrm{SNR}_{N}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR}_{N} = \\frac{|s(t_{0})|}{\\sigma_{\\bar{n},N}} = \\frac{|s(t_{0})|}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}} = \\sqrt{N} \\cdot \\frac{|s(t_{0})|}{\\sigma}\n$$\nBy recognizing the definition of the single-sweep SNR, $\\mathrm{SNR}_{1} = \\frac{|s(t_{0})|}{\\sigma}$, we can write the final relationship:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR}_{N} = \\sqrt{N} \\cdot \\mathrm{SNR}_{1}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the task. The Signal-to-Noise Ratio of the ensemble average improves as the square root of the number of accepted sweeps.\n\nThe second task is to compute the expected improvement factor in SNR when increasing the number of sweeps from $N_{1} = 100$ to $N_{2} = 400$. The improvement factor is the ratio of the final SNR to the initial SNR.\n$$\n\\text{Improvement Factor} = \\frac{\\mathrm{SNR}_{N_{2}}}{\\mathrm{SNR}_{N_{1}}}\n$$\nUsing the derived dependence on $N$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR}_{N_{1}} = \\mathrm{SNR}_{100} = \\sqrt{100} \\cdot \\mathrm{SNR}_{1} = 10 \\cdot \\mathrm{SNR}_{1}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR}_{N_{2}} = \\mathrm{SNR}_{400} = \\sqrt{400} \\cdot \\mathrm{SNR}_{1} = 20 \\cdot \\mathrm{SNR}_{1}\n$$\nNow, we compute the ratio:\n$$\n\\text{Improvement Factor} = \\frac{20 \\cdot \\mathrm{SNR}_{1}}{10 \\cdot \\mathrm{SNR}_{1}} = \\frac{20}{10} = 2\n$$\nAlternatively, using the general formula for the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{SNR}_{N_{2}}}{\\mathrm{SNR}_{N_{1}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_{2}} \\cdot \\mathrm{SNR}_{1}}{\\sqrt{N_{1}} \\cdot \\mathrm{SNR}_{1}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_{2}}}{\\sqrt{N_{1}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $N_{1} = 100$ and $N_{2} = 400$:\n$$\n\\text{Improvement Factor} = \\sqrt{\\frac{400}{100}} = \\sqrt{4} = 2\n$$\nThe expected improvement factor is a dimensionless quantity equal to $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "5082571"}, {"introduction": "Once clean cVEMP waveforms are obtained for both ears, the central clinical question often becomes: is there a significant difference between the two sides?

It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or ill-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe objective is to determine a justified conclusion regarding the function of the right inferior vestibular nerve, distinguishing true pathology from measurement artifact. This requires a systematic analysis of the provided latency and amplitude data, adhering to the stated principles.\n\n**1. Analysis of Latencies**\nThe latencies reflect the neural conduction time of the sacculo-collic reflex arc. A significant delay or absence would suggest a neural lesion.\n-   **Left Ear (Control):** The positive peak latencies ($t_p$) are $13.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and $13.2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. The negative peak latencies ($t_n$) are $23.1\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and $23.0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. These are consistent and normal.\n-   **Right Ear (Affected):** For the recordings where a response was obtained, $t_p$ values are $13.6\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and $13.4\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, and $t_n$ values are $23.4\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and $23.3\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n-   **Interaural Comparison:** The latencies for the right ear are nearly identical to those for the left ear. For instance, comparing the accepted recordings, left $t_p = 13.2-13.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ vs. right $t_p = 13.4\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. This symmetry in latencies strongly suggests that the neural conduction along the right inferior vestibular nerve and its central pathways is intact and not pathologically delayed.\n\n**2. Analysis of Amplitudes and SCM Activation**\nThe principles state that cVEMP amplitude ($A$) is proportional to background EMG ($E$) and that comparisons must account for $E$.\n-   **Right Ear, Initial Attempt:** A background EMG of $E = 12\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V}$ is very low, far below the lab's acceptance threshold of $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V}$. The resulting \"absence\" of a response ($A \\approx 0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V}$) is an expected consequence of inadequate SCM activation. This finding is a technical artifact and cannot be interpreted as evidence of pathology.\n-   **Amplitude Normalization:** To properly compare the ears, we must normalize the cVEMP amplitude by the background EMG. The normalized amplitude is a ratio, $A_{norm} = A/E$. We will use the recordings from each ear that are within the acceptance band and have the most comparable EMG levels for the most direct comparison.\n    -   **Left Ear (1st accepted recording):** $E_{L1} = 60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V}$, $A_{L1} = 120\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V}$.\n        $$A_{L,norm} = \\frac{120\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V}}{60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V}} = 2.0$$\n        (The second left ear recording gives $A_{L,norm} = 110/54 \\approx 2.04$, which is highly consistent).\n    -   **Right Ear (accepted recording):** $E_{R,acc} = 55\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V}$, $A_{R,acc} = 90\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V}$.\n        $$A_{R,norm} = \\frac{90\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V}}{55\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V}} \\approx 1.636$$\n-   **Interaural Asymmetry Calculation:** The clinically standard metric is the Asymmetry Ratio (AR), calculated from the normalized amplitudes.\n    $$AR = \\frac{|A_{L,norm} - A_{R,norm}|}{A_{L,norm} + A_{R,norm}}$$\n    $$AR = \\frac{|2.0 - 1.636|}{2.0 + 1.636} = \\frac{0.364}{3.636} \\approx 0.100$$\n-   **Interpretation of Asymmetry:** In clinical practice, an asymmetry ratio for cVEMP amplitudes is typically considered abnormal if it exceeds a threshold of around $35-45\\%$. An AR of approximately $10\\%$ is well within the normal range, indicating no significant asymmetry between the two ears once muscle activation levels are properly accounted for.\n\n**3. Synthesis of Conclusion**\n1.  The initial \"absent\" response on the right was due to insufficient muscle contraction, a technical artifact.\n2.  When adequate muscle contraction was achieved, a robust response was present on the right.\n3.  The latencies on the right are normal and symmetric with the left.\n4.  The amplitude on the right, when correctly normalized for background EMG, shows no clinically significant asymmetry compared to the left.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that the sacculo-collic reflex pathway, mediated by the inferior vestibular nerve, is functionally intact on the right side.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The right ear demonstrates true absence of cVEMP; the lack of peaks at low EMG and the smaller amplitude at higher EMG confirm inferior vestibular nerve hypofunction despite acceptable background contraction.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. It incorrectly interprets the lack of response at low EMG as a sign of \"true absence,\" when it is a known artifact. A clear response was obtained with proper technique. It also misinterprets the raw \"smaller amplitude\" without performing the necessary normalization, which shows the difference is not significant.\n\n**B. The initial apparent absence on the right is attributable to inadequate SCM activation; once background EMG is within the acceptance band, latencies are concordant and amplitude normalized to EMG shows interaural asymmetry within normal limits, indicating preserved right sacculo-collic function.**\nThis statement is **Correct**. It accurately identifies the cause of the initial absent response. It correctly notes the concordance (symmetry) of latencies. Most importantly, it draws the correct conclusion from the normalized amplitude data, which shows an asymmetry ratio within normal limits. This leads to the correct final interpretation of preserved function.\n\n**C. The left ear responses are falsely elevated because background EMG exceeded the recommended band; amplitude normalization will increase the interaural asymmetry and strengthen evidence of right hypofunction.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. The premise is factually false. The left ear recordings had background EMG of $60\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V}$ and $54\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V}$, both of which are squarely *within* the specified acceptance band of $[50, 150]\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V}$. Therefore, the conclusion based on this false premise is invalid.\n\n**D. Background EMG monitoring is not relevant to cVEMP amplitude interpretation; stimulus intensity alone governs cVEMP magnitude, so the right ear shows a true reduction independent of muscle activation.**\nThis statement is **Incorrect**. It makes a claim that is in direct contradiction to a fundamental principle of cVEMP physiology, which is explicitly stated in the problem setup: \"cVEMP peak-to-peak amplitude scales with the level of tonic SCM activation\". Ignoring EMG monitoring is a recipe for clinical error, and this entire problem is designed to illustrate that point.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5082551"}]}
