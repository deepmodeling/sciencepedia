Each epoch has a duration of $30$ seconds. Lights out occurs at clock time $22{:}45$ and lights on at $06{:}15$. The total number of epochs scored across the entire recording interval is $900$. The epoch counts by state are as follows: wake before sleep onset $60$ epochs; wake after sleep onset $90$ epochs; Stage N1 sleep $80$ epochs; Stage N2 sleep $440$ epochs; Stage N3 sleep $110$ epochs; Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep $120$ epochs.

It utilizes standard terminology, procedures (polysomnography), scoring criteria (AASM), and diagnostic metrics (AHI, TST, SE, SOL, WASO) from the field of sleep medicine. The values provided for sleep stage distribution and respiratory events are plausible for a patient with OSA.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient, non-contradictory data to calculate all requested quantities. The definitions are standard and lead to a unique solution.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms, free from subjective or pseudo-profound claims.\n4.  **Consistency Check**: A consistency check confirms the integrity of the provided data.\n    -   The total number of epochs based on the sum of individual state counts is $N_{\\text{wake\\_pre}} + N_{\\text{WASO\\_epochs}} + N_{N1} + N_{N2} + N_{N3} + N_{\\text{REM}} = 60 + 90 + 80 + 440 + 110 + 120 = 900$. This matches the given total scored epochs, $N_{\\text{total}} = 900$.\n    -   The Total Recording Time (TRT), also known as Time in Bed (TIB), is the interval from lights out ($22{:}45$) to lights on ($06{:}15$). The duration is $(24:00 - 22:45) + (06:15) = 1 \\text{ hr } 15 \\text{ min} + 6 \\text{ hr } 15 \\text{ min} = 7 \\text{ hr } 30 \\text{ min}$.\n    -   Converting TRT to seconds: $7.5 \\text{ hr} \\times 3600 \\text{ s/hr} = 27000 \\text{ s}$.\n    -   The number of epochs in TRT is $\\frac{27000 \\text{ s}}{30 \\text{ s/epoch}} = 900 \\text{ epochs}$. This also matches the given $N_{\\text{total}}$.\n    -   The data are internally consistent and consistent with the time-based parameters.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The solution will now be derived from first principles.\n\nThe derivation proceeds by first calculating fundamental sleep parameters: Total Sleep Time (TST), Sleep Efficiency (SE), Sleep Onset Latency (SOL), and Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO). These parameters facilitate an interpretation of the sleep architecture. Finally, the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) is computed.\n\nThe duration of a single epoch is $t_{\\text{epoch}} = 30 \\text{ s}$, which is equivalent to $0.5 \\text{ min}$.\n\n**1. Total Sleep Time (TST)**\nTST is the cumulative time spent in all sleep stages (N1, N2, N3, and REM). It is calculated by summing the number of epochs for each sleep stage and multiplying by the epoch duration.\nThe total number of sleep epochs, $N_{\\text{sleep}}$, is:\n$$N_{\\text{sleep}} = N_{N1} + N_{N2} + N_{N3} + N_{\\text{REM}} = 80 + 440 + 110 + 120 = 750 \\text{ epochs}$$\nThe TST in minutes is:\n$$TST = N_{\\text{sleep}} \\times (0.5 \\text{ min/epoch}) = 750 \\times 0.5 = 375 \\text{ min}$$\nThis is equivalent to $6.25$ hours.\n\n**2. Sleep Efficiency (SE)**\nSE is the ratio of TST to the Total Recording Time (TRT), expressed as a decimal fraction.\nThe TRT is $450$ minutes, as calculated during validation.\n$$SE = \\frac{TST}{TRT} = \\frac{375 \\text{ min}}{450 \\text{ min}} = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.833$$\nA normal SE is generally considered to be $\\ge 0.85$. The calculated value of approximately $0.833$ indicates reduced sleep efficiency.\n\n**3. Sleep Onset Latency (SOL)**\nSOL is the time from lights out to the first epoch of sleep. The problem provides the number of wake epochs before sleep onset, $N_{\\text{wake\\_pre}} = 60$.\n$$SOL = N_{\\text{wake\\_pre}} \\times (0.5 \\text{ min/epoch}) = 60 \\times 0.5 = 30 \\text{ min}$$\nA normal SOL is typically less than $30$ minutes. A value of $30$ minutes is at the upper limit of the normal range, suggesting a potential minor difficulty in initiating sleep.\n\n**4. Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO)**\nWASO is the total time spent awake after the initial onset of sleep. The problem provides the count of these epochs, $N_{\\text{WASO\\_epochs}} = 90$.\n$$WASO = N_{\\text{WASO\\_epochs}} \\times (0.5 \\text{ min/epoch}) = 90 \\times 0.5 = 45 \\text{ min}$$\nThis represents a significant amount of wakefulness during the sleep period, indicating fragmented sleep and difficulty in sleep maintenance.\n\n**5. Sleep Architecture Interpretation**\nThe sleep architecture is abnormal and characteristic of fragmented sleep, consistent with OSA.\n-   **Stage Distribution (% of TST)**: TST is $750$ epochs.\n    -   Stage N1: $\\frac{N_{N1}}{N_{\\text{sleep}}} = \\frac{80}{750} \\approx 10.7\\%$. (Normal: $5-10\\%$). This is at the high end of normal or slightly elevated, indicative of frequent arousals.\n    -   Stage N2: $\\frac{N_{N2}}{N_{\\text{sleep}}} = \\frac{440}{750} \\approx 58.7\\%$. (Normal: $45-55\\%$). This is elevated, suggesting a predominance of lighter sleep.\n    -   Stage N3: $\\frac{N_{N3}}{N_{\\text{sleep}}} = \\frac{110}{750} \\approx 14.7\\%$. (Normal: $15-25\\%$). This is reduced, consistent with respiratory events disrupting the progression to deep, restorative sleep.\n    -   Stage REM: $\\frac{N_{\\text{REM}}}{N_{\\text{sleep}}} = \\frac{120}{750} = 16.0\\%$. (Normal: $20-25\\%$). This is significantly reduced. REM sleep is often suppressed in OSA due to increased susceptibility to respiratory events in this stage.\nIn summary, the reduced SE, elevated WASO, and the sleep stage distribution (increased N1/N2, decreased N3/REM) collectively paint a clear picture of disrupted and poor-quality sleep, strongly supporting the initial suspicion of OSA.\n\n**6. Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)**\nThe AHI is the primary metric for quantifying OSA severity. It is defined as the total number of apneas and hypopneas divided by the TST in hours.\nFirst, the total number of respiratory events, $E_{\\text{total}}$, is calculated:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = E_{N1} + E_{N2} + E_{N3} + E_{\\text{REM}} = 30 + 180 + 25 + 90 = 325 \\text{ events}$$\nThe TST in hours, $TST_{\\text{hr}}$, is $6.25$ hours.\nThe AHI is then computed:\n$$AHI = \\frac{E_{\\text{total}}}{TST_{\\text{hr}}} = \\frac{325}{6.25} = 52 \\text{ events/hour}$$\nAccording to AASM guidelines, an AHI of $\\ge 30$ events/hour in an adult is classified as severe OSA. The calculated AHI of $52$ confirms a diagnosis of severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea.\nThe problem requires the final AHI to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$AHI = 52.0 \\text{ events/hour}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{52.0}$$", "id": "5061928"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of the Apnea-Hypopnea Index ($AHI$), this next practice explores a critical nuance in its calculation that can have significant diagnostic implications. You will mathematically derive and quantify the bias introduced when the $AHI$ is incorrectly calculated using Total Recording Time ($TRT$) instead of Total Sleep Time ($TST$) in the denominator.

Across sleep epochs, the scorer identifies a total of $198$ respiratory events (apneas plus hypopneas). In interpreting the severity of sleep-disordered breathing, the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) is conventionally defined as the number of respiratory events per hour of sleep, that is, events divided by total sleep time in hours.

The study was scored according to standard criteria: an oxygen desaturation event is defined as a transient decrease in oxygen saturation from the pre-event baseline of at least $\\Delta S$ lasting at least $10$ seconds, with consecutive events separated by at least $30$ seconds.
