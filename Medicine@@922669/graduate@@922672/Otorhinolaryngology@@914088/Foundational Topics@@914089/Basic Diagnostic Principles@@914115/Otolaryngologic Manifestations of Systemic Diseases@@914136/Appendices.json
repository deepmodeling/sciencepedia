The parameters $\\eta$ (viscosity of air) and $L$ (length of the affected segment) are assumed to be constant before and after the procedure.\n\nThe ratio of the post-stent resistance to the pre-stent resistance is therefore:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{post}}}{R_{\\text{pre}}} = \\frac{\\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r_{\\text{post}}^{4}}}{\\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r_{\\text{pre}}^{4}}}$$\n\nThe constant term $\\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi}$ cancels out, simplifying the expression to an inverse relationship with the fourth power of the radius:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{post}}}{R_{\\text{pre}}} = \\frac{r_{\\text{pre}}^{4}}{r_{\\text{post}}^{4}} = \\left(\\frac{r_{\\text{pre}}}{r_{\\text{post}}}\\right)^{4}$$\n\nThe problem provides the diameters. The radius $r$ is half the diameter $d$.\nThe pre-stent radius is $r_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{d_{\\text{pre}}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\text{ mm}}{2} = 3 \\text{ mm}$.\nThe post-stent radius is $r_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{d_{\\text{post}}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\text{ mm}}{2} = 4 \\text{ mm}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the ratio expression:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{post}}}{R_{\\text{pre}}} = \\left(\\frac{3 \\text{ mm}}{4 \\text{ mm}}\\right)^{4} = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{4}$$\nThe units of millimeters cancel, resulting in a dimensionless quantity as expected.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value:\n$$\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{4} = \\frac{3^{4}}{4^{4}} = \\frac{81}{256}$$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal value:\n$$\\frac{81}{256} = 0.31640625$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

It is scientifically grounded in established clinical pharmacology principles, well-posed with all necessary data and constraints, and presented objectively. A step-by-step derivation of the solution will now be presented.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the initial daily dose of levothyroxine for a patient based on a set of clinical parameters and dosing rules. The calculation proceeds in several sequential steps: determination of the appropriate body weight for dosing, calculation of the full-replacement dose, determination of the dose reduction factor based on risk, and finally, calculation of the initial starting dose.\n\nFirst, we must determine the patient's Ideal Body Weight (IBW) to ascertain whether it should be used as the basis for dosing instead of the actual body weight. The problem states that for overweight patients, the IBW should be used. A patient is considered overweight if their actual body weight exceeds their IBW.\n\nThe patient's height is given as $H = 160\\ \\mathrm{cm}$. The Devine formula for IBW requires height in inches. The conversion is $1\\ \\mathrm{inch} = 2.54\\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\nThe height in inches, $H_{\\text{in}}$, is:\n$$H_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{160\\ \\mathrm{cm}}{2.54\\ \\mathrm{cm/inch}}$$\nThe provided formula for the ideal body weight for females is:\n$$\\mathrm{IBW}_{\\text{female}} = 45.5\\ \\mathrm{kg} + 2.3\\ \\mathrm{kg} \\times (H_{\\text{in}} - 60)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $H_{\\text{in}}$:\n$$\\mathrm{IBW}_{\\text{female}} = 45.5 + 2.3 \\times \\left(\\frac{160}{2.54} - 60\\right)$$\nCalculating the value within the parentheses:\n$$\\frac{160}{2.54} - 60 \\approx 62.9921 - 60 = 2.9921\\ \\mathrm{inches}$$\nNow, we calculate the IBW:\n$$\\mathrm{IBW}_{\\text{female}} \\approx 45.5 + 2.3 \\times 2.9921 \\approx 45.5 + 6.8818 \\approx 52.3818\\ \\mathrm{kg}$$\nThe patient's actual body weight is $W_{\\text{actual}} = 82\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.

This is a classic application of Bayes' theorem in the context of medical diagnostics.\n\nFirst, we must validate the problem statement. The problem provides a clinically realistic scenario involving the diagnosis of a systemic autoimmune disease. All provided data—the pretest probability ($p = 0.30$), test sensitivity ($Se = 0.85$), and test specificity ($Sp = 0.95$)—are well-defined probabilistic quantities and fall within plausible ranges for the given clinical context. The problem is self-contained, mathematically sound, and free from scientific inaccuracies, subjectivity, or ambiguity. It asks for a derivation from first principles, which is a well-posed task. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the derivation. Let us define the following events:\n- $D$: The event that the patient has GPA.\n- $D^c$: The event that the patient does not have GPA.\n- $T^+$: The event that the PR3-ANCA test result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the PR3-ANCA test result is negative.\n\nThe information provided in the problem can be translated into the language of probability theory:\n- The pretest probability of disease is the prior probability of event $D$: $P(D) = p = 0.30$.\n- The probability of not having the disease is the complement: $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\n- The sensitivity is the conditional probability of a positive test given the presence of the disease: $Se = P(T^+ | D) = 0.85$.\n- The specificity is the conditional probability of a negative test given the absence of the disease: $Sp = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95$.\n\nWe are asked to find the probability of having GPA given a positive test result, which is the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nBy the definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\nHere, $P(D \\cap T^+)$ is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. $P(T^+)$ is the total probability of testing positive.\n\nLet's first analyze the numerator, $P(D \\cap T^+)$. Using the definition of conditional probability, $P(T^+ | D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(D)}$, we can rearrange it to express the joint probability:\n$$P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D)$$\nThis term represents the probability of a true positive result.\n\nNext, we analyze the denominator, $P(T^+)$. According to the law of total probability, the event $T^+$ can be partitioned into two mutually exclusive events: testing positive with the disease ($T^+ \\cap D$) and testing positive without the disease ($T^+ \\cap D^c$). Therefore, we can write:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nWe have already found an expression for the first term, $P(T^+ \\cap D) = P(T^+ | D) P(D)$.\nFor the second term, we can similarly write:\n$$P(T^+ \\cap D^c) = P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nThis term represents the probability of a false positive result.\n\nThe quantity $P(T^+ | D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test in a patient without the disease. This is not directly given. However, we are given the specificity, $Sp = P(T^- | D^c)$. For a patient without the disease, the test can only be positive ($T^+$) or negative ($T^-$). Thus, the probabilities of these two outcomes must sum to $1$:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) + P(T^- | D^c) = 1$$\nFrom this, we find:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp$$\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions back into the formula for $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + (1 - Sp) P(D^c)$$\n\nFinally, substituting the expanded forms of the numerator and denominator into our original expression for $P(D | T^+)$ yields Bayes' theorem for this problem:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + (1 - Sp) P(D^c)}$$\nIn terms of the provided symbolic constants, the derived expression is:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}$$\nThis is the general expression for the positive predictive value derived from first principles.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the given data:\n- Pretest probability: $p=0.30$\n- Sensitivity: $Se = 0.85$\n- Specificity: $Sp = 0.95$\n\nFirst, we calculate the components of the expression:\n- The probability of a true positive: $Se \\cdot p = 0.85 \\times 0.30 = 0.255$.\n- The probability of a false positive: $(1 - Sp)(1 - p) = (1 - 0.95)(1 - 0.30) = 0.05 \\times 0.70 = 0.035$.\n- The total probability of a positive test: $P(T^+) = 0.255 + 0.035 = 0.290$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $P(D | T^+)$:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{0.255}{0.290}$$\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{255}{290} = \\frac{51}{58}$$\nThe numerical value is approximately $0.87931034...$.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\nThe fifth significant figure is $1$, so we round down.\nThe final numerical value is $0.8793$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8793}$$", "id": "5056620"}]}
