The unstimulated whole salivary flow (UWS) is measured by passive drooling into a calibrated tube over a timed interval, and the stimulated whole salivary flow (SWS) is measured after gustatory stimulation. By definition, the flow rate $Q$ is the time derivative of collected volume, $Q = dV/dt$, and the multiplicative change with stimulation (the “fold increase”) is the ratio of stimulated to unstimulated flow.

It is scientifically grounded in established medical diagnostic criteria, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its language. The premises are factually correct, the data are physically plausible, and the task requires a direct application of the provided definitions, leading to a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of two quantities: the fold increase in salivary flow, $F$, and an indicator for hyposalivation, $H$. We are provided with the necessary definitions and measured values.\n\nFirst, we calculate the fold increase, $F$. The problem defines $F$ as the multiplicative change with stimulation, which is the ratio of the stimulated whole salivary flow, $Q_s$, to the unstimulated whole salivary flow, $Q_0$. The formula is given as:\n$$F = \\frac{Q_s}{Q_0}$$\nWe are provided with the measured values for these flows:\n- Unstimulated flow, $Q_0 = 0.1$ milliliters per minute.\n- Stimulated flow, $Q_s = 1.2$ milliliters per minute.\n\nSubstituting these values into the definition for $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{1.2}{0.1} = 12$$\nThe problem requires that the value of $F$ be reported to three significant figures. To express the integer $12$ with three significant figures, we write it as $12.0$. Thus, $F = 12.0$.\n\nNext, we determine the value of the hyposalivation indicator, $H$. The problem states that the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) Sjögren’s syndrome classification framework defines an objective hyposalivation criterion. This criterion is met when the unstimulated whole salivary flow (UWS), represented by $Q_0$, is at or below a threshold of $0.1$ milliliters per minute. This can be expressed as the following inequality:\n$$Q_0 \\le 0.1$$\nThe patient's measured UWS is given as $Q_0 = 0.1$ milliliters per minute. We evaluate the inequality with this value:\n$$0.1 \\le 0.1$$\nThis inequality is true, as the value $0.1$ is equal to itself, satisfying the \"at or below\" condition. Therefore, the hyposalivation criterion is met for this patient.\n\nThe indicator variable $H$ is defined to take the value $1$ if the hyposalivation criterion is met and $0$ otherwise. Since the criterion is met, we assign the value:\n$$H = 1$$\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the answer to be reported as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}F & H\\end{pmatrix}$.

Express the result as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n    3. Provide a brief pathophysiological interpretation.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the Hagen–Poiseuille law of fluid dynamics, a fundamental principle used to model flow in cylindrical tubes. The application of this law to salivary duct obstruction is a standard and valid simplification in biophysical modeling. The clinical scenario is realistic. The problem provides all necessary information and clear definitions to arrive at a unique solution. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or scientifically unsound premises.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem states that for a constant driving pressure difference $\\Delta P$, fluid viscosity $\\eta$, and duct length $L$, the volumetric flow rate $Q$ through a cylindrical duct is proportional to the fourth power of its radius $r$. This relationship is derived from the Hagen–Poiseuille equation:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L} r^{4}$$\nWe can write this as a proportionality:\n$Q = k r^{4}$\nwhere the constant of proportionality is $k = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$. According to the problem statement, $k$ is assumed to be the same for both the unobstructed and obstructed states.\n\nLet $Q_{0}$ be the flow rate in the unobstructed duct of radius $r_{0}$, and $Q_{1}$ be the flow rate in the obstructed duct of radius $r_{1}$. We can write:\n$Q_{0} = k r_{0}^{4}$\n$Q_{1} = k r_{1}^{4}$\n\nThe problem states that there is a $20\\%$ reduction in the duct radius in the obstructed segment. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$r_{1} = r_{0} - 0.20 r_{0} = (1 - 0.20) r_{0} = 0.80 r_{0}$\n\nWe are asked to compute the fractional reduction in volumetric salivary flow, $\\delta$, defined as:\n$\\delta = \\frac{Q_{0} - Q_{1}}{Q_{0}}$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$\\delta = 1 - \\frac{Q_{1}}{Q_{0}}$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $Q_{0}$ and $Q_{1}$ in terms of the radii:\n$\\delta = 1 - \\frac{k r_{1}^{4}}{k r_{0}^{4}} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{r_{1}}{r_{0}}\\right)^{4}$\nSubstitute the relationship between $r_{1}$ and $r_{0}$:\n$\\delta = 1 - \\left(\\frac{0.80 r_{0}}{r_{0}}\\right)^{4} = 1 - (0.80)^{4}$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$(0.80)^{2} = 0.64$\n$((0.80)^{2})^{2} = (0.64)^{2} = 0.4096$\nFinally, we compute $\\delta$:\n$\\delta = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.5904$ already has four significant figures.\n\n### Pathophysiological Interpretation\nThe calculated fractional reduction in flow is $\\delta = 0.5904$, which corresponds to a $59.04\\%$ decrease in salivary flow for a constant driving pressure. The relationship $Q \\propto r^{4}$ dictates that even a modest reduction in duct radius leads to a disproportionately large reduction in flow capacity. A $20\\%$ decrease in radius results in a nearly $60\\%$ decrease in flow.\n\nThis hydrodynamic principle directly explains the patient's symptoms. During meals (preprandial and prandial phases), the parasympathetic nervous system stimulates the parotid gland to significantly increase saliva production. The gland attempts to expel this large volume of fluid through the partially obstructed Stensen's duct. To overcome the dramatically increased resistance (as flow capacity is reduced by nearly $60\\%$), the intraglandular and intraductal pressure ($\\Delta P$) proximal to the obstruction must rise substantially. This sharp increase in pressure causes distention of the salivary ducts and the gland itself, which is perceived by the patient as severe pain. This pressure buildup also leads to the transient swelling of the gland.\n\nBetween meals, salivary flow is at a low basal rate. The gland does not need to generate high pressures to expel this small volume, so the pressure proximal to the stone decreases, and the pain and swelling subside. The stasis of saliva caused by the obstruction also increases the risk of retrograde bacterial infection, leading to sialadenitis (inflammation of the gland).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5904}\n$$", "id": "5027081"}, {"introduction": "Expert clinical practice involves navigating diagnostic uncertainty by systematically updating one's assessment as new evidence becomes available.

Therefore, we require the probability of a negative test given the disease is present, which is the false negative rate (FNR).\n$P(T^-|D) = 1 - P(T^+|D) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\nThe specificity, $Sp$, is the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent: $Sp = P(T^-|D^c) = 0.95$. This is also known as the true negative rate (TNR).\n\nThe objective is to find the posterior probability of sialolithiasis given the negative ultrasound result, which is denoted $P(D|T^-)$.\n\nWe begin from the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(D|T^-) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^-)}{P(T^-)}$$\n\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T^-)$, can be re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability, $P(T^-|D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^-)}{P(D)}$, which gives:\n$$P(D \\cap T^-) = P(T^-|D) P(D)$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, represents the total probability of a negative test. It can be expanded using the law of total probability by conditioning on the presence or absence of the disease:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- \\cap D) + P(T^- \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the re-expression from the previous step for each term, we get:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^-|D)P(D) + P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into the original formula for $P(D|T^-)$ yields Bayes' theorem for this case:\n$$P(D|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D) P(D)}{P(T^-|D)P(D) + P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)}$$\n\nThis is the exact expression for the posterior probability. We can express it in terms of sensitivity and specificity:\n$$P(D|T^-) = \\frac{(1 - Se) P(D)}{(1 - Se)P(D) + Sp \\cdot P(D^c)} = \\frac{(1 - Se) P(D)}{(1 - Se)P(D) + Sp(1 - P(D))}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression to compute the exact posterior probability:\n$$P(D|T^-) = \\frac{(1 - 0.90) \\times 0.6}{(1 - 0.90) \\times 0.6 + 0.95 \\times (1 - 0.6)}$$\n$$P(D|T^-) = \\frac{0.10 \\times 0.6}{0.10 \\times 0.6 + 0.95 \\times 0.4}$$\n$$P(D|T^-) = \\frac{0.06}{0.06 + 0.38}$$\n$$P(D|T^-) = \\frac{0.06}{0.44}$$\n\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we can write the decimal values as fractions and simplify:\n$$P(D|T^-) = \\frac{6/100}{44/100} = \\frac{6}{44} = \\frac{3}{22}$$\n\nThe posterior probability of sialolithiasis given the negative ultrasound is $\\frac{3}{22}$.\n\nFinally, we must justify whether immediate computed tomography (CT) is warranted. The action threshold for additional imaging is given as $0.2$. We must compare our calculated posterior probability to this threshold.\nThe posterior probability is $P(D|T^-) = \\frac{3}{22}$.\nTo compare this with the threshold, we can convert both to decimals or a common denominator.\n$\\frac{3}{22} \\approx 0.13636...$\nThe action threshold is $0.2$.\nSince $0.13636... < 0.2$, the posterior probability of disease is below the action threshold.\n\nThe justification, based on principled diagnostic threshold thinking, is as follows: The pretest probability of $0.6$ indicated a moderate-to-high suspicion of disease. The negative ultrasound, a test with high specificity ($0.95$), provided strong evidence against the disease, substantially lowering the probability from $0.6$ to approximately $0.136$. This revised probability is now below the clinically established threshold of $0.2$ at which the risks, costs, and potential benefits of further, more invasive or expensive testing (like a CT scan) are deemed to be justified. Therefore, based on this threshold, immediate CT is not warranted.
