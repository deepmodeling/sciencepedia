Let $V_s$ denote the angular velocity of the eye in space, which corresponds to the rate of change of the direction of gaze. According to the problem's sign convention, rightward rotation is positive.\n\nThe given values are:\n- Head angular velocity: $V_h = +120^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$\n- Eye-in-head angular velocity: $V_e = -90^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$\n\nThe first fundamental basis provided is the principle of superposition of angular velocities. This principle states that the angular velocity of the eye in space is the sum of the angular velocity of the head in space and the angular velocity of the eye relative to the head. This can be expressed as:\n$$V_s = V_h + V_e$$\n\nThe second fundamental basis defines retinal slip for a stationary visual target. Retinal slip, denoted by $R_s$, is the instantaneous angular velocity of the line of sight relative to the target. Since the target is stationary, its angular velocity in space is $0$. The line of sight's angular velocity in space is $V_s$. Therefore, the retinal slip is:\n$$R_s = V_s - 0 = V_s$$\n\nBy substituting the first equation into the second, we derive the expression for the instantaneous retinal slip in terms of the given variables, $V_h$ and $V_e$:\n$$R_s = V_h + V_e$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of the retinal slip using the provided data. We substitute $V_h = 120^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$ and $V_e = -90^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$ into the derived expression:\n$$R_s = (120^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}) + (-90^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}) = 120^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s} - 90^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s} = 30^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe retinal slip has a value of $30^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$. The positive sign indicates that the line of sight is moving to the right in space, failing to fully compensate for the rightward head rotation.\n\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of the retinal slip. The magnitude is the absolute value of $R_s$:\n$$|R_s| = |30^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}| = 30^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem requires this numerical answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $30$, which is already expressed with two significant figures.\n\nFinally, we must determine if visual acuity would be preserved. The third fundamental basis provided is the perceptual fact that high foveal visual acuity is preserved when the magnitude of retinal slip is less than approximately $4^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$. We compare our calculated magnitude to this threshold:\n$$|R_s| = 30^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$$\nSince $30^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$ is significantly greater than the $4^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$ tolerance, we conclude that visual acuity for the stationary target would be degraded at this instant. This is indicative of a deficient VOR, as the compensatory eye movement is insufficient to stabilize the gaze on the target. For perfect stabilization, the eye-in-head velocity would need to be $V_e = -V_h = -120^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$, which would result in a retinal slip of $R_s = 0^{\\circ}\\!/\\mathrm{s}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{30}$$", "id": "5085082"}, {"introduction": "Real-world vHIT analysis requires processing discrete time-series data of head and eye velocity, not just a single, clean gain value.

The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) acts to stabilize gaze by producing eye velocity opposite to head velocity. The VOR gain $g$ is defined pointwise by $g_k = -\\dfrac{v_e[k]}{v_h[k]}$ when $v_h[k] \\ne 0$, so that an ideal compensatory response has $g_k \\approx 1$. To compute a mean gain over a time window, we average the pointwise gains across the samples within the specified window. Saccades are rapid eye movements characterized by high acceleration; from sampled velocity data, eye acceleration can be estimated using the central difference $a_e[k] = \\dfrac{v_e[k+1] - v_e[k-1]}{2\\,\\Delta t}$, and saccades can be detected by $|a_e[k]|$ exceeding a threshold.\n\nGiven $f_s = 500\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, the sampling interval is $\\Delta t = \\dfrac{1}{f_s} = 0.002\\,\\mathrm{s}$.

At $k=56$, the central difference uses $v_e[57]$ and $v_e[55]$, which are both $-180 + 75 = -105$, yielding\n$$\na_e[56] = \\dfrac{v_e[57] - v_e[55]}{0.004} = \\dfrac{(-105) - (-105)}{0.004} = 0,\n$$\nso the peak accelerations are captured at the rising and falling edges ($k=55$ and $k=57$).

This property implies that the function $F$ must depend only on the ratio of its arguments. Let's choose the ratio $x = G_{L}/G_{R}$. Thus, $AI$ can be expressed as a function of this ratio alone, i.e., $AI = f(G_{L}/G_{R})$.\n\nWe now apply the other properties to determine the form of $f(x)$:\n1.

Thus, $G_L$ is the gain of the left canal's VOR, and $G_R$ is the gain of the right canal's VOR. A normal gain is close to $1.0$.\n\nThe calculated $AI$ is positive ($AI \\approx +0.2517$), which, by the definition we derived, signifies that $G_{L}  G_{R}$. The measured values confirm this ($0.92  0.55$). The left-sided gain, $G_L = 0.92$, is near the normal range, whereas the right-sided gain, $G_R = 0.55$, is substantially reduced. This pattern indicates a deficit in the function of the right horizontal semicircular canal.\n\nTherefore, the clinical interpretation is as follows: The positive sign of the asymmetry index indicates a relative hypofunction of the vestibulo-ocular reflex for head movements toward the right side. The magnitude of the index, $0.2517$ (or $25.17\\%$), quantifies this asymmetry.
