A complete solution will now be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe objective is to compute the area margin. This requires a sequential calculation of the total flap area, the usable flap area, and the defect area.\n\n1.  **Calculate the total area of the HBNF flap ($A_{\\text{flap}}$)**.\n    The flap is modeled as a trapezoid with height $L$ and parallel bases $b_1$ and $b_2$. The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula:\n    $$A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_{\\text{base1}} + b_{\\text{base2}}) \\times h$$\n    In this problem, the height $h$ corresponds to the anterior-posterior dimension $L$, and the bases are $b_1$ and $b_2$.\n    The given values are:\n    $$L = 5.0 \\text{ cm}, \\quad b_1 = 2.2 \\text{ cm}, \\quad b_2 = 3.0 \\text{ cm}$$\n    The total flap area is therefore:\n    $$A_{\\text{flap}} = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)L = \\frac{1}{2}(2.2 \\text{ cm} + 3.0 \\text{ cm})(5.0 \\text{ cm})$$\n    $$A_{\\text{flap}} = \\frac{1}{2}(5.2 \\text{ cm})(5.0 \\text{ cm}) = 13.0 \\text{ cm}^2$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the usable flap area ($A_{\\text{usable}}$)**.\n    The problem states that $15\\%$ of the total flap area must be reserved for overlap. This portion is not available for covering the defect. The usable area is the remaining fraction of the total area.\n    The fraction of the flap that is usable is $100\\% - 15\\% = 85\\%$.\n    $$A_{\\text{usable}} = (1 - 0.15) \\times A_{\\text{flap}} = 0.85 \\times A_{\\text{flap}}$$\n    Substituting the calculated total flap area:\n    $$A_{\\text{usable}} = 0.85 \\times 13.0 \\text{ cm}^2 = 11.05 \\text{ cm}^2$$\n\n3.  **Calculate the area of the dural defect ($A_{\\text{defect}}$)**.\n    The defect is rectangular with dimensions $3.5$ cm and $2.0$ cm. The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width.\n    $$A_{\\text{defect}} = (3.5 \\text{ cm}) \\times (2.0 \\text{ cm}) = 7.0 \\text{ cm}^2$$\n\n4.  **Calculate the area margin ($A_{\\text{margin}}$)**.\n    The area margin is defined as the usable flap area minus the defect area.\n    $$A_{\\text{margin}} = A_{\\text{usable}} - A_{\\text{defect}}$$\n    Substituting the calculated areas:\n    $$A_{\\text{margin}} = 11.05 \\text{ cm}^2 - 7.0 \\text{ cm}^2 = 4.05 \\text{ cm}^2$$\n\n5.  **Apply Final Rounding**.\n    The problem explicitly requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
