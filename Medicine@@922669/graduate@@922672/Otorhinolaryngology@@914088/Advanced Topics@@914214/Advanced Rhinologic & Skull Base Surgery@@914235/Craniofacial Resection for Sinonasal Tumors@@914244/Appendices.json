To ensure microscopically negative margins along a planned surgical plane, assume the one-dimensional microscopic extension distance beyond the visible tumor edge is a nonnegative random variable governed by an exponential distribution due to memoryless local infiltrative behavior. The mean microscopic extension distance differs by histology: for Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC), the mean is $3$ millimeters, and for Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC), the mean is $6$ millimeters, reflecting deeper perineural and submucosal spread in ACC. Let the exponential rate parameter be $\\lambda$ with mean $1/\\lambda$.

The model is based on an exponential distribution for microscopic tumor spread.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the provided information and define the mathematical framework. Let $X$ be the random variable representing the one-dimensional microscopic extension distance beyond the visible tumor edge. The problem states that $X$ follows an exponential distribution. The probability density function (PDF) of an exponential distribution with a rate parameter $\\lambda > 0$ is:\n$$f(x; \\lambda) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x), \\quad \\text{for } x \\ge 0$$\nThe corresponding cumulative distribution function (CDF), which gives the probability that the random variable $X$ is less than or equal to a specific value $x$, is:\n$$F(x; \\lambda) = P(X \\le x) = \\int_0^x \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\,dt = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda x), \\quad \\text{for } x \\ge 0$$\nThe mean of this distribution is related to the rate parameter by $E[X] = \\mu = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$.\n\nThe problem provides the following parameters:\n- Mean microscopic extension for SCC: $\\mu_{SCC} = 3$ mm.

The corresponding rate parameter is $\\lambda_{ACC} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{ACC}} = \\frac{1}{6}$ mm$^{-1}$.\n- A fixed loss at the cut surface due to saw kerf: $k = 1$ mm.\n\nThe gross margin width, $W$, is the planned distance from the visible tumor edge to the location of the surgical cut. The saw kerf reduces this planned margin, resulting in a net available margin, $W_{net}$, which is what protects against the microscopic spread $X$. The net margin is:\n$$W_{net} = W - k$$\nThe condition for an adequate resection is that the probability of the microscopic extension $X$ being contained within this net available margin is at least $0.95$.

Rearranging the terms:\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda (W - k)) = 1 - 0.95$$\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda (W - k)) = 0.05$$\nTo isolate the exponent, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\lambda (W - k) = \\ln(0.05)$$\nSolving for $(W - k)$:\n$$W - k = -\\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\lambda}$$\nSince $\\mu = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$, we can substitute this into the equation:\n$$W - k = -\\mu \\ln(0.05)$$\nThe natural logarithm can be simplified: $\\ln(0.05) = \\ln(\\frac{5}{100}) = \\ln(\\frac{1}{20}) = -\\ln(20)$.
