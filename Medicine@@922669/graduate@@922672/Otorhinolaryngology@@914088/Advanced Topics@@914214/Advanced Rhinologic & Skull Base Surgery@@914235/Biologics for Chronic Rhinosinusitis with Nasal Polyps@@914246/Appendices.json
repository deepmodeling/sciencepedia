You will work through the pharmacokinetic algorithm to determine the correct per-injection dose and frequency, translating patient data into a concrete therapeutic action [@problem_id:5010444].", "problem": "A patient with Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP) is evaluated for omalizumab therapy. The patient's baseline total Immunoglobulin E ($I$) is $420$ International Units per milliliter (IU/mL), and body weight ($W$) is $82$ kilograms. Omalizumab dosing for CRSwNP follows the same population-pharmacokinetic framework validated in asthma, which targets sustained suppression of free Immunoglobulin E by selecting a monthly dose proportional to baseline $I$ and $W$, using a clinically established proportionality constant $k$ for the four-week total dose.\n\nAssume the following well-tested facts and implementation constraints used in the regulatory dosing algorithm:\n- The four-week total dose is given by $D_{4w} = k \\, W \\, I$, with $k = 0.016$ milligrams per (IU/mL$\\cdot$kg).\n- The injection interval $\\tau$ is chosen from $\\{2, 4\\}$ weeks such that the per-injection dose $D_{\\text{inj}}$ does not exceed $300$ milligrams.\n- The per-injection dose is delivered in integer multiples of $75$ milligrams. To avoid undertreatment relative to the pharmacodynamic target, if $D_{\\text{inj}}$ falls between two adjacent $75$ milligram increments, round $D_{\\text{inj}}$ up to the next higher increment.\n\nUsing these principles and constraints, determine the per-injection omalizumab dose and the dosing interval for this patient.

Calculate the Theoretical Four-Week Total Dose ($D_{4w}$)**\n\nThe four-week total dose is calculated using the provided formula:\n$$D_{4w} = k \\, W \\, I$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n*   $k = 0.016 \\, \\text{mg/(IU/mL}\\cdot\\text{kg)}$\n*   $W = 82 \\, \\text{kg}$\n*   $I = 420 \\, \\text{IU/mL}$\n\n$$D_{4w} = (0.016) \\times (82) \\times (420) \\, \\text{mg}$$\n$$D_{4w} = (1.312) \\times (420) \\, \\text{mg}$$\n$$D_{4w} = 551.04 \\, \\text{mg}$$\nThis is the total dose required over a $4$-week period to achieve the target pharmacodynamic effect.\n\n**2. Determine the Dosing Interval ($\\tau$)**\n\nThe dosing interval $\\tau$ must be chosen from the set $\\{2, 4\\}$ weeks. The choice is governed by the constraint that the final per-injection dose, $D_{\\text{inj}}$, cannot exceed $300$ mg. We must evaluate the two possible intervals.\n\n*   **Case 1: Assume a $4$-week interval ($\\tau = 4$ weeks).**\n    If the dose is administered every $4$ weeks, the entire $4$-week dose is given in a single injection. The theoretical per-injection dose would be:\n    $$D_{\\text{inj, theoretical}} = D_{4w} = 551.04 \\, \\text{mg}$$\n    This theoretical dose of $551.04$ mg violates the constraint $D_{\\text{inj}} \\le 300$ mg. Therefore, an interval of $4$ weeks is not permissible for this patient.\n\n*   **Case 2: Assume a $2$-week interval ($\\tau = 2$ weeks).**\n    If the dose is administered every $2$ weeks, the total $4$-week dose is split into two equal injections. The theoretical per-injection dose would be:\n    $$D_{\\text{inj, theoretical}} = \\frac{D_{4w}}{2} = \\frac{551.04}{2} \\, \\text{mg} = 275.52 \\, \\text{mg}$$\n    This dose of $275.52$ mg does not violate the maximum dose constraint ($275.52 \\le 300$). Therefore, the only valid dosing interval is $\\tau = 2$ weeks.\n\n**3. Calculate the Final Per-Injection Dose ($D_{\\text{inj}}$)**\n\nThe final per-injection dose must be an integer multiple of $75$ mg. According to the rounding rule, if the theoretical dose is not an exact multiple, it must be rounded *up* to the next higher increment.\n\nOur theoretical per-injection dose is $275.52$ mg. We find the multiples of $75$ mg:\n*   $1 \\times 75 = 75$\n*   $2 \\times 75 = 150$\n*   $3 \\times 75 = 225$\n*   $4 \\times 75 = 300$\n\nThe theoretical dose $275.52$ mg falls between $225$ mg and $300$ mg. Applying the rule to round up to the next higher increment, we select $300$ mg.\n$$D_{\\text{inj}} = 300 \\, \\text{mg}$$\n\nThis final dose $D_{\\text{inj}} = 300$ mg also satisfies the maximum dose constraint ($300 \\le 300$).\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis determines that the patient requires a per-injection dose of $300$ mg administered every $2$ weeks.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   Per-injection dose, $D_{\\text{inj}} = 300$ mg.\n*   Dosing interval, $\\tau = 2$ weeks.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 300 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5010444"}]}
