The linear model is of the form:\n$$ Q = m P_{\\mathrm{us}} + b $$\nwhere $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the Q-intercept. We are given $n=5$ data pairs $(P_{\\mathrm{us},i}, Q_i)$. Let us denote $x_i = P_{\\mathrm{us},i}$ and $y_i = Q_i$.

This meets the definition of a **central apnea**.\n- $E_3$: Occurs during wake. As per the instructions, events during wake are not counted. Therefore, this event is **excluded**.\n- $E_4$: Occurs in $N3$ sleep for $10\\,\\mathrm{s}$ ($\\geq 10\\,\\mathrm{s}$). Airflow is flat with persistent paradoxical effort. This is an **obstructive apnea**.\n- $E_5$: Occurs in REM sleep for $16\\,\\mathrm{s}$ ($\\geq 10\\,\\mathrm{s}$). Airflow is flat. Respiratory effort is absent for the first $6\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and then resumes. This meets the definition of a **mixed apnea**.\n- $E_6$: Occurs in $N2$ sleep for $22\\,\\mathrm{s}$ ($\\geq 10\\,\\mathrm{s}$). Airflow is flat with persistent paradoxical effort. This is an **obstructive apnea**.\n- $E_7$: Occurs in $N2$ sleep for $12\\,\\mathrm{s}$ ($\\geq 10\\,\\mathrm{s}$). Airflow is flat with no respiratory effort. This is a **central apnea**.

Since the duration is less than the required $10\\,\\mathrm{s}$, this event does not qualify as an apnea. It is therefore **excluded**.\n- $E_{18}$: Occurs in $N3$ sleep for $11\\,\\mathrm{s}$ ($\\geq 10\\,\\mathrm{s}$). Airflow is flat with persistent paradoxical effort.
