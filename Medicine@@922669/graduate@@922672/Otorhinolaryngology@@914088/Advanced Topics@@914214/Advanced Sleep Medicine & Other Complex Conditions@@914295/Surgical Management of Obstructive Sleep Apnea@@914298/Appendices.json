Assume the following physiologically reasonable modeling assumptions for the retroglossal airway: (i) a fixed coupling efficiency so that only a fraction $\\eta = 0.40$ of the resected tongue base volume manifests as an increase in retroglossal airway volume, (ii) the retroglossal segment over which this volumetric gain is distributed has uniform geometry with effective length $L = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ so that any volume change is uniformly distributed along this length, and (iii) near the operating point, the retroglossal segment behaves as a collapsible segment with approximately linear area–pressure behavior characterized by an area–pressure compliance $C = 0.25\\,\\text{cm}^2/\\text{cmH}_2\\text{O}$.

This can be determined by calculating the change in $P_{\\text{crit}}$ resulting from the surgical procedure. The derivation proceeds in a series of logical steps.\n\nFirst, we calculate the volume of tongue base tissue that is resected. The initial volume is $V_{\\text{tongue, pre}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{cm^{3}}$ and the resection percentage is $R = 0.25$. The resected volume, $\\Delta V_{\\text{tongue}}$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\text{tongue}} = V_{\\text{tongue, pre}} \\times R = (30\\,\\mathrm{cm^{3}}) \\times 0.25 = 7.5\\,\\mathrm{cm^{3}}\n$$\n\nSecond, we determine the increase in the retroglossal airway volume, $\\Delta V_{\\text{airway}}$. The coupling efficiency, $\\eta = 0.40$, represents the fraction of the resected tissue volume that translates into an actual increase in airway volume.\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\text{airway}} = \\eta \\times \\Delta V_{\\text{tongue}} = 0.40 \\times 7.5\\,\\mathrm{cm^{3}} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm^{3}}\n$$\n\nThird, we calculate the corresponding increase in the cross-sectional area of the airway, $\\Delta A$. The problem states that this volumetric gain is uniformly distributed over a retroglossal segment of effective length $L = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. The volume of this segment is its cross-sectional area multiplied by its length. Therefore, the change in volume is related to the change in area by:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\text{airway}} = \\Delta A \\times L\n$$\nSolving for $\\Delta A$:\n$$\n\\Delta A = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{airway}}}{L} = \\frac{3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm^{3}}}{3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{cm^{2}}\n$$\n\nFourth, we use the definition of area–pressure compliance to find the change in pressure associated with this change in area. The compliance, $C$, is given as $C = 0.25\\,\\text{cm}^2/\\text{cmH}_2\\text{O}$. The problem specifies an approximately linear area–pressure relationship, which allows us to define compliance as the ratio of the change in area to the change in transmural pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{transmural}}$:\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta P_{\\text{transmural}}}\n$$\nThe critical closing pressure, $P_{\\text{crit}}$, is the external pressure at which the airway collapses under passive conditions (zero intraluminal pressure). An increase in the airway's intrinsic size (i.e., an increase in $\\Delta A$ at a given pressure) means that the airway is now less prone to collapse. Consequently, the external pressure required to cause collapse is lower. The change in $P_{\\text{crit}}$ is therefore equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the calculated change in transmural pressure required to effect the area change $\\Delta A$. The shift in the pressure-area curve, $\\Delta P$, represents this magnitude.\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\frac{\\Delta A}{C} = \\frac{1.0\\,\\text{cm}^2}{0.25\\,\\text{cm}^2/\\text{cmH}_2\\text{O}} = 4.0\\,\\text{cmH}_2\\text{O}\n$$\nA positive $\\Delta A$ (airway enlargement) leads to a decrease in $P_{\\text{crit}}$.
