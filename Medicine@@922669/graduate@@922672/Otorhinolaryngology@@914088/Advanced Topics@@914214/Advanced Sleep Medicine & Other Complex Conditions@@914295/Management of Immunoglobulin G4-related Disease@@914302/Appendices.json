He has no asthma, no known allergies, and denies constitutional symptoms. Nasal endoscopy reveals diffusely edematous, pale mucosa without frank polyps, and a firm, submucosal thickening of the posterior nasal septum. Computed tomography (CT) of the paranasal sinuses shows circumferential sinonasal mucosal thickening with focal homogeneous submucosal expansion along the nasal septum and nasopharyngeal wall, without bone erosion. Laboratory studies show a normal complete blood count except mild eosinophils of $0.6 \\times 10^9/\\mathrm{L}$, normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) of $0.7 \\ \\mathrm{g/L}$, within the laboratory reference range.

The plan should adhere to the following principles derived from accepted frameworks: systemic fibroinflammatory disorders can cause progressive tissue fibrosis if untreated; glucocorticoids induce remission in active IgG4-RD; B-cell depletion targets the pathogenic plasmablast axis; and sinonasal surgery addresses mechanical obstruction but does not treat the underlying immunopathology.

The triad of histopathological findings—(1) dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, (2) storiform fibrosis, and (3) obliterative phlebitis—is pathognomonic for IgG4-RD. The high count of IgG4-positive plasma cells ($50/\\mathrm{HPF}$) and an elevated IgG4/IgG ratio ($40\\%$) strongly confirm the diagnosis according to consensus diagnostic criteria. The problem correctly notes that serum IgG4 levels can be normal in up to $40\\%$ of patients with biopsy-proven disease, making histology the gold standard. The lack of necrotizing granulomas or vasculitis correctly distinguishes the entity from key mimics like granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). The provided principles of management (glucocorticoids for induction, rituximab as a steroid-sparing agent, systemic screening, and limited role for surgery) are all consistent with international consensus guidelines on the management of IgG4-RD. The entire premise is scientifically sound and factually correct.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a comprehensive dataset (history, exam, imaging, labs, and definitive pathology) and a set of established principles. The task is to select the management plan that best integrates these data and principles. This is a standard clinical reasoning problem that has a single best answer based on current evidence-based medicine. It is well-posed.\n*   **Objective:** The language is clinical, precise, and free from subjective or biased statements.\n\n**Conclusion of Validation:** The problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is free of the flaws listed in the instructions. It represents a valid and solvable clinical reasoning problem.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe patient's presentation is definitively diagnosed as Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) based on the comprehensive 2019 ACR/EULAR classification criteria, which are met by the histopathology findings (dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, storiform fibrosis, obliterative phlebitis, and high IgG4+ cell count with a high IgG4/IgG ratio). The normal serum IgG4 level does not refute the diagnosis, a key point explicitly mentioned in the problem's principles. The disease is active, as indicated by the progressive symptoms and inflammatory mass. The core management goals, derived from the provided principles, are to induce remission to halt the progressive fibroinflammatory process, screen for other organ involvement, and manage local symptoms.\n\n**1. Diagnosis Confirmation and Differential:** The primary diagnosis is IgG4-RD. The biopsy findings are classic. However, in any case involving a sinonasal mass, a differential diagnosis must be considered and ruled out. Key considerations include other inflammatory/granulomatous disorders (granulomatosis with polyangiitis, sarcoidosis), lymphoproliferative disorders (lymphoma), and other rare inflammatory conditions (eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis). The biopsy results, particularly the absence of necrotizing granulomas and true vasculitis, make GPA less likely. The absence of well-formed non-caseating granulomas argues against sarcoidosis. While a B-cell lymphoma can be in the differential, the overall pattern is more consistent with IgG4-RD.\n\n**2. Induction of Remission:** Consistent with the principle \"glucocorticoids induce remission in active IgG4-RD,\" systemic glucocorticoid therapy is the first-line treatment. The standard induction dose for non-life-threatening but organ-compromising disease is prednisone at $0.6$ to $1.0 \\ \\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$. This is followed by a slow taper over several months to minimize relapse and steroid-related toxicity.\n\n**3. Systemic Staging:** As per the principle that IgG4-RD is a systemic disorder, a comprehensive evaluation for multiorgan involvement is mandatory upon diagnosis. This includes a thorough history and physical examination, baseline laboratory tests (including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel for liver and kidney function), and urinalysis. Serum complement levels ($C3$, $C4$) can be low, particularly in cases with renal involvement (tubulointerstitial nephritis). Cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI of chest/abdomen/pelvis) or, more sensitively, whole-body Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT) is often employed to identify occult sites of inflammation.\n\n**4. Symptom Control and Adjunctive Therapy:** While systemic therapy addresses the root cause, local symptoms should be managed. For sinonasal disease, intranasal saline irrigations and intranasal corticosteroids can improve mucosal edema and obstruction.\n\n**5. Long-term Management and Steroid-Sparing:** Due to the high rate of relapse upon glucocorticoid tapering and the significant toxicity of long-term steroid use, a strategy for steroid-sparing therapy is essential. The principle regarding B-cell depletion points to rituximab, which targets CD20+ B cells, the precursors to the pathogenic plasmablasts/plasma cells. Rituximab is the most effective and widely used agent for relapsing/refractory disease or as a primary steroid-sparing agent.\n\n**6. Role of Surgery:** The principle provided correctly states that surgery is not curative. Its role is primarily for biopsy and, secondarily, for relief of severe mechanical obstruction that is refractory to medical therapy. Initial debulking is not the standard of care as the mass is expected to shrink with effective systemic treatment.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Prioritize chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis because serum Immunoglobulin G4 is normal; proceed to endoscopic sinus surgery and prolonged antibiotics, avoid immunosuppression, and treat obstruction with decongestants.**\nThis option makes a critical error by dismissing the definitive histopathology in favor of a single, non-definitive laboratory test (serum IgG4). This directly contradicts the provided principle that \"tissue features drive diagnosis.\" The proposed management is for standard chronic rhinosinusitis, not a systemic fibroinflammatory disease, and would lead to unchecked disease progression and potential irreversible fibrosis.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Recognize histology as diagnostic for Immunoglobulin G4-related disease despite normal serum Immunoglobulin G4; construct a differential that includes granulomatosis with polyangiitis, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis, and chronic rhinosinusitis. Initiate systemic glucocorticoids at $0.6 \\ \\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$ prednisone for $2$–$4$ weeks followed by a gradual taper over $2$–$3$ months; add intranasal corticosteroids and saline irrigation for symptom control; screen for multiorgan involvement with targeted history, examination, liver and kidney panels, complement levels ($C3$, $C4$), and imaging guided by symptoms (consider positron emission tomography-computed tomography if systemic involvement is suspected). Plan steroid-sparing with rituximab if relapse, refractoriness, or contraindications occur; reserve endoscopic sinus surgery for persistent mechanical obstruction after induction.**\nThis option correctly identifies IgG4-RD based on histology. It proposes a sound differential diagnosis. The management plan is fully aligned with all the provided principles and current international guidelines:\n*   Correct induction therapy (systemic glucocorticoids at an appropriate dose and taper).\n*   Appropriate adjunctive local therapy for symptoms.\n*   Mandatory and thorough screening for systemic disease.\n*   A clear and correct plan for steroid-sparing therapy (rituximab).\n*   The correct, limited role for surgery.\nThis represents a comprehensive, evidence-based, and integrated approach.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. Because sinonasal thickening suggests vasculitis, treat with cyclophosphamide induction and azathioprine maintenance without glucocorticoids; order antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing and schedule immediate endoscopic sinus surgery to debulk disease.**\nThis option incorrectly prioritizes vasculitis despite biopsy findings that explicitly rule it out (\"no vasculitis\"). The proposed treatment with cyclophosphamide without glucocorticoids is inappropriate for IgG4-RD and is a regimen typically used for ANCA-associated vasculitis. Immediate surgical debulking is also not indicated. This approach ignores the definitive biopsy a priori.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Observe conservatively with topical decongestants and re-biopsy in $6$ months because IgG4-related disease of the nose is self-limited; avoid systemic therapy to minimize steroid toxicity, and consider radiation therapy if the mass enlarges.**\nThis option is dangerously incorrect. It mischaracterizes IgG4-RD as self-limited, directly contradicting the principle that it causes \"progressive tissue fibrosis if untreated.\" Withholding systemic therapy for active, progressive disease would allow for irreversible organ damage. Observation is not the standard of care. Radiation therapy is a treatment of last resort, not an early consideration.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Administer pulse intravenous methylprednisolone $1 \\ \\mathrm{g/day}$ for $3$ days, obtain whole-body positron emission tomography-computed tomography to stage disease, and refer for external beam radiation therapy to the sinonasal lesion to prevent progression; avoid intranasal therapies as they may mask systemic activity.**\nThis approach is overly aggressive and inappropriate. Pulse IV steroids are reserved for acute, life- or organ-threatening emergencies (e.g., pancreatitis, rapidly progressive renal failure), which is not the case here. Referring for radiation therapy as an initial step is incorrect and exposes the patient to unnecessary risk. Avoiding intranasal therapies is illogical; they are helpful for local symptoms and do not interfere with the assessment or treatment of systemic disease.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5041450"}, {"introduction": "Glucocorticoids remain the first-line therapy for inducing remission in active IgG4-RD.

The three phases are: (A) the initial induction phase, (B) the tapering phase, and (C) the final maintenance phase.\n\n**Part 1: Initial Daily Dose Calculation**\nThe initial daily dose is based on the patient's weight and the recommended dose rate.\nThe patient's weight is $W = 80\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\nThe recommended dose rate is $d = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$.\nThe calculated initial daily dose is:\n$$D_{calc} = W \\times d = 80\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 0.6\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{day}} = 48\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$$\nThe problem states this dose must be rounded to the nearest $5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.

The final dose level in this phase is $15\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$, because the subsequent reduction brings the dose to $10\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$, which marks the beginning of the next phase.\n\nThe sequence of daily doses in the tapering phase is an arithmetic progression: ($45, 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15$).\nEach of these $k$ dose levels is maintained for a duration of $14$ days.\nThe number of dose levels, $k$, in this phase is:\n$$k = \\frac{(45 - 15)}{5} + 1 = \\frac{30}{5} + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7$$\nThe cumulative dose for the tapering phase, $C_B$, is the sum of the cumulative doses for each of the $7$ steps:\n$$C_B = (45 \\times 14) + (40 \\times 14) + (35 \\times 14) + (30 \\times 14) + (25 \\times 14) + (20 \\times 14) + (15 \\times 14)$$\nThis can be simplified by factoring out the duration, $14\\,\\text{days}$:\n$$C_B = (45 + 40 + 35 + 30 + 25 + 20 + 15) \\times 14$$\nThe sum of the arithmetic series is $S = \\frac{k}{2}(a_1 + a_k)$, where $a_1=45$ and $a_k=15$.\n$$S = \\frac{7}{2}(45 + 15) = \\frac{7}{2}(60) = 210$$\nNow, we calculate $C_B$:\n$$C_B = 210 \\times 14\\,\\text{days} = 2940\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\n**Phase C: Maintenance**\nAfter the tapering phase, the patient reaches a daily dose of $D_{maint} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$.

Rituximab at a dose of $375 \\ \\mathrm{mg/m^2}$ weekly for $4$ weeks is a recognized regimen for Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD), and the patient's body surface area is within a normal physiological range. The problem is a direct and formalizable application of clinical pharmacology principles.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as requested: the quantitative calculation of the total drug dose and a qualitative outline of a safe infusion plan.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Total Cumulative Rituximab Dose**\n\nThe calculation proceeds from the foundational principles provided.\n\nFirst, the dose for a single infusion ($D_{\\text{infusion}}$) is determined based on the principle that the dose is proportional to body surface area. This is computed by multiplying the prescribed dose per square meter ($D_{\\text{unit}}$) by the patient's body surface area ($A_{\\text{BSA}}$).\n\nThe given values are:\n-   Prescribed dose per square meter, $D_{\\text{unit}} = 375 \\ \\mathrm{mg/m^2}$.\n-   Patient's body surface area, $A_{\\text{BSA}} = 1.9 \\ \\mathrm{m^2}$.\n\nThe dose for a single infusion is therefore:\n$$D_{\\text{infusion}} = D_{\\text{unit}} \\times A_{\\text{BSA}}$$\n$$D_{\\text{infusion}} = 375 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{m}^2} \\times 1.9 \\ \\mathrm{m}^2$$\n$$D_{\\text{infusion}} = 712.5 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nSecond, the total cumulative dose for the full induction course ($D_{\\text{total}}$) is calculated based on the principle that the cumulative dose is the sum of per-infusion doses over the number of scheduled infusions. The regimen specifies a number of infusions, $N$, equal to $4$.\n\nThe total cumulative dose is the product of the single infusion dose and the number of infusions:\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = D_{\\text{infusion}} \\times N$$\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = 712.5 \\ \\mathrm{mg} \\times 4$$\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = 2850 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThus, the total cumulative mass of rituximab the patient will receive over the full $4$-week induction course is $2850 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$.\n\n**Part 2: Infusion Premedication and Monitoring Plan**\n\nAdministering rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody, requires a structured plan to mitigate the risk of infusion-related reactions (IRRs), which are common, particularly during the first exposure. The patient's specific head-and-neck involvement with IgG4-RD necessitates heightened vigilance for airway compromise.\n\n**A. Premedication Regimen**\n\nTo minimize the frequency and severity of IRRs, the following premedications should be administered approximately $30$ to $60$ minutes prior to the start of the rituximab infusion:\n1.  **Glucocorticoid:** Intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone ($100 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$) or an equivalent corticosteroid (e.g., hydrocortisone). This is crucial for blunting the cytokine release that underlies many systemic IRRs.\n2.  **Antihistamine (H1 Blocker):** IV or oral diphenhydramine ($25-50 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$) or a non-sedating alternative like cetirizine. This counteracts histamine-mediated symptoms such as pruritus, urticaria, and vasodilation.\n3.  **Antipyretic:** Oral acetaminophen ($650-1000 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$). This helps prevent fever and chills (rigors) associated with the infusion.\n\n**B. Monitoring and Escalation Plan**\n\nThe infusion must be conducted in a monitored setting with immediate access to resuscitation equipment, emergency medications (including epinephrine, bronchodilators, and additional corticosteroids), and trained medical personnel.\n\n**1. Baseline and Initial Infusion (First Dose):**\n-   **Baseline Vitals:** A full set of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and peripheral oxygen saturation) must be documented before administering premedications and again immediately before starting the rituximab infusion.\n-   **Initial Infusion Rate:** The first infusion should begin at a slow rate, typically $50 \\ \\mathrm{mg/hr}$.\n-   **Frequent Monitoring:** Vital signs must be monitored at a minimum of every $15$ minutes for the first hour of the infusion. The patient should be assessed for subjective and objective signs of an IRR, including rash, pruritus, dyspnea, chest tightness, back pain, anxiety, throat tightness, or rigors.\n-   **Rate Titration:** If no reaction occurs after the first hour, the infusion rate may be increased by increments of $50 \\ \\mathrm{mg/hr}$ every $30$ minutes, up to a maximum rate (e.g., $400 \\ \\mathrm{mg/hr}$). After each rate increase, the patient should be observed closely. Once the rate is stable, monitoring frequency can be reduced to every hour until the infusion is complete, followed by a post-infusion observation period of at least $1$ hour.\n\n**2. Escalation Criteria and Management for IRRs:**\n-   **Trigger:** Any new sign or symptom suggestive of an IRR (e.g., hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, bronchospasm, stridor, angioedema, new rash, fever, or rigors) is an immediate trigger for action.\n-   **Immediate Action:**\n    1.  **STOP the infusion immediately.**\n    2.  Perform a rapid assessment of the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC).\n    3.  Notify the supervising clinician and the rapid response team, if indicated.\n-   **Specific Interventions based on Severity:**\n    -   **Mild-to-Moderate (e.g., pruritus, mild rash, low-grade fever):** Administer supportive care. The infusion may be cautiously restarted at half the rate at which the reaction occurred once symptoms have fully resolved.\n    -   **Severe (e.g., hypotension, bronchospasm, hypoxia, angioedema):** This constitutes a medical emergency. Administer IV fluids, supplemental oxygen, and emergency medications as required (e.g., IV corticosteroids, bronchodilators, or intramuscular/IV epinephrine for anaphylaxis). The infusion for the day is typically terminated.\n-   **Heightened Airway Vigilance:** Given the patient's pre-existing nasopharyngeal and submandibular pathology, any symptom of oropharyngeal or laryngeal involvement (e.g., change in voice, sensation of throat swelling or tightness, stridor, drooling) must be treated as a sign of impending airway compromise. There should be a very low threshold to administer epinephrine and prepare for advanced airway management (e.g., intubation) in this specific clinical context.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2850}\n$$", "id": "5041456"}]}
