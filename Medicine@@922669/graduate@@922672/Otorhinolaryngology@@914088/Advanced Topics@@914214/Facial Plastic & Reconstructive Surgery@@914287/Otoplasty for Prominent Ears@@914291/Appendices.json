Intraoperatively, the right antihelix is difficult to bend and a brief “crack” is heard during suture tightening; postoperatively, the left ear shows early partial relapse of the fold with palpable suture tracks. Mustardé sutures act by imposing curvature on auricular cartilage via posterior mattress fixation, transmitting tension through the perichondrium-cartilage complex. Consider the following biomechanical facts: for elastic materials in the linear range, stress is given by Hooke’s law $\\sigma = E \\epsilon$, bending resistance is governed by the flexural rigidity $D = EI$ with $I$ the second moment of area, and contact pressure scales as $p \\propto F/A$, where $F$ is the suture force and $A$ the engaged tissue area. Stress concentration at free edges or notches is captured by a factor $K_t > 1$, amplifying local stress.

Reduces risk of \"cheese-wiring\" (suture cutting through tissue).\n    2.  Reduces risk of acute cartilage fracture.\n    3.  Maintains durable contour correction.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides established physical laws ($\\sigma = E \\epsilon$, $D=EI$, $p \\propto F/A$, stress concentration) and applies them to a realistic clinical situation. The terminology is precise, and the complications described (\"crack,\" \"relapse,\" \"palpable suture tracks\") are well-known phenomena that can be explained by these physical principles. The problem is self-contained and asks for the evaluation of proposed strategies based on the provided framework. No flaws are identified. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe problem requires a strategy that navigates a trade-off: sufficient force must be applied to bend the cartilage and overcome its springback for a durable result, but excessive or poorly applied force leads to material failure (fracture or cheese-wiring).\n\n- **To reduce fracture risk**: The stress $\\sigma$ in the cartilage must be kept below its ultimate strength. Stress arises from bending and suture contact. Strategies should aim to:\n    1.  Reduce the force $F$ required to achieve the bend. This can be done by decreasing the cartilage's flexural rigidity, $D=EI$.\n    2.  Avoid stress concentrations, i.e., minimize $K_t$ by avoiding suture placement near sharp edges.\n    3.  Apply force gradually and distribute it over a larger area.\n\n- **To reduce cheese-wiring risk**: The contact pressure $p$ at the suture-tissue interface must be minimized. Since $p \\propto F/A$, strategies should aim to:\n    1.  Decrease the force $F$ in each suture.\n    2.  Increase the area $A$ over which the force is applied.\n\n- **To ensure durable correction**: The corrective forces must be sufficient to overcome the cartilage's intrinsic springback and must be maintained over the long term until the cartilage permanently adopts the new shape.\n\nLet's evaluate each option against these requirements.\n\n**A. Decrease suture bite width and depth to minimize needle trauma, use a high-tension monofilament tightened to immediate maximal fold, and place fewer sutures to reduce cumulative foreign material load.**\n- *Decrease suture bite width and depth*: This decreases the engaged tissue area $A$. For a given force $F$, this dramatically increases the contact pressure $p$ ($p \\propto F/A$), directly increasing the risk of cheese-wiring. This is contrary to the stated goal.\n- *High-tension... tightened to immediate maximal fold*: This implies a large, rapidly applied force $F$. This high force increases contact pressure $p$ and overall stress $\\sigma$, elevating the risk of both cheese-wiring and fracture, especially in stiff cartilage as described.\n- *Fewer sutures*: This concentrates the total required bending force into fewer points, requiring a higher force $F$ per suture, further exacerbating the risks of fracture and cheese-wiring.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect. This strategy actively promotes the very complications it claims to prevent.\n\n**B. Prepare the anterior (convex) surface with controlled scoring to decrease local flexural rigidity by reducing the effective $I$, place multiple Mustardé sutures with wider posterior horizontal mattress bites that capture robust perichondrium on both sides of the cartilage, and tighten to a distributed, moderate tension rather than maximal single-suture load.**\n- *Anterior scoring*: This technique involves making partial-thickness incisions in the cartilage. A key principle of beam bending is that the outermost fibers experience the highest stress. Scoring the anterior (convex) surface disrupts these fibers, effectively reducing the second moment of area $I$. This lowers the flexural rigidity $D=EI$, making the cartilage easier to bend. A lower required bending moment means lower required suture tension $F$, reducing the risk of both fracture and cheese-wiring. It also helps counteract springback for a more durable fold.\n- *Wider... bites*: This increases the contact area $A$, thereby decreasing contact pressure $p$ ($p \\propto F/A$) and mitigating the risk of cheese-wiring.\n- *Multiple sutures... distributed, moderate tension*: This distributes the total necessary force among several points, lowering the force $F$ on any individual suture, which reduces both peak stress $\\sigma$ (fracture risk) and contact pressure $p$ (cheese-wiring risk).\n- **Verdict**: Correct. This option presents a cohesive and biomechanically sound strategy. Each component directly addresses the underlying physics to solve the stated problems: scoring reduces intrinsic resistance, while wider bites and distributed tension optimize force application.\n\n**C. Place Mustardé sutures as close as possible to the helical rim to shorten the lever arm so that the same suture tension produces a larger bending moment per unit force, thereby making folding more efficient even if local edge stresses rise.**\n- *Physical reasoning*: This statement contains a fundamental error in mechanics. The bending moment $M$ is the product of force and the lever arm distance ($M \\approx F \\cdot d$). To achieve a required moment $M$, shortening the lever arm $d$ would necessitate an *increase* in the applied force $F$, not make the process more efficient.\n- *Proximity to helical rim*: The helical rim is a free edge. As stated in the problem, stress concentration ($K_t > 1$) is significant at free edges. Placing sutures there would amplify local stress, substantially increasing the risk of cartilage fracture or tearing, a fact the option misguidedly dismisses.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect. The underlying physical premise is false, and the proposed action would increase fracture risk.\n\n**D. Use absorbable sutures to allow gradual loss of tension, thereby decreasing sustained contact pressure at the suture-tissue interface and reducing the chance of cheese-wiring over time.**\n- *Absorbable sutures*: Mustardé sutures are a cartilage-shaping technique that relies on permanent fixation. Auricular cartilage has significant elastic memory (\"springback\") and remodels very slowly. Absorbable sutures would lose their tension and dissolve long before the cartilage has permanently assumed its new shape.\n- *Outcome*: This would inevitably lead to a loss of correction and relapse of the prominent ear, as seen on the patient's left side. It fails the critical requirement of \"maintaining durable contour correction.\" While it might eventually eliminate cheese-wiring by eliminating the force, it does so at the cost of complete surgical failure.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect. This strategy sacrifices the primary surgical goal for a misguided approach to a secondary complication.\n\n**E. In ears with concomitant conchal bowl prominence, add concha–mastoid (Furnas) sutures to offload the antihelical fold demand, and distribute the Mustardé tension across more sutures with appropriately spaced, broad mattress bites that include perichondrium to increase engaged area, avoiding sharp bends and excessive edge proximity that increase $K_t$.**\n- *Add concha–mastoid sutures*: Prominence of the ear is often a compound deformity, involving both an under-developed antihelical fold and an oversized conchal bowl. By correcting the conchal component separately (e.g., with Furnas sutures), the surgeon reduces the overall amount of setback required from the antihelical fold alone. This \"offloads\" the system, meaning less force $F$ is needed in the Mustardé sutures to achieve a natural contour, thus reducing the risk of both fracture and cheese-wiring. This also improves long-term stability and prevents relapse.\n- *Distribute tension... broad mattress bites*: As in option B, this is a correct application of principles to reduce $F$ per suture and increase $A$, thereby minimizing $p$ and $\\sigma$.\n- *Avoiding ... edge proximity that increase $K_t$*: This is a direct and explicit application of the stress concentration principle provided in the problem statement to reduce fracture risk.\n- **Verdict**: Correct. This option describes a sophisticated, multi-component strategy that addresses the ear deformity holistically. It reduces the required forces by treating all components of the deformity and then applies those reduced forces in a biomechanically optimal way, explicitly considering force distribution, contact area, and stress concentration. This comprehensive approach is highly effective and reliable.\n\n### Conclusion on Correct Options\nBoth options B and E describe valid, effective, and biomechanically sound strategies. They are not mutually exclusive and represent two powerful approaches that can be used in combination.\n- **Option B** focuses on modifying the material properties ($I$) of the antihelix to make it more compliant.\n- **Option E** focuses on managing the forces across the entire auricular structure and applying them with optimal technique.\nThe question asks for the \"best option(s),\" with the plural form indicating that more than one answer may be correct. Since both B and E are excellent, non-contradictory strategies that directly and reliably address the problem's objectives based on the given principles, both are considered correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BE}$$", "id": "5056838"}, {"introduction": "A well-executed otoplasty can look perfect on the operating table, but its true success is measured by its long-term stability.
