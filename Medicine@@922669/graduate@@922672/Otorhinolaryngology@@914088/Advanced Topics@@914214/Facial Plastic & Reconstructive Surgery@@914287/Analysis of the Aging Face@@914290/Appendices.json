The midface is represented by the triangle formed by three cephalometric landmarks: nasion ($N$), subspinale ($A$), and prosthion ($Pr$). The sagittal axis is defined as the $x$-axis, with anterior direction taken as positive. Assume the cranial base is stable after skeletal maturity, so the nasion $N$ serves as the fixed origin at $x_{N}(t)=0$. The midface projection is quantified by the centroid’s sagittal position,\n$$\nx_{\\text{centroid}}(t)=\\frac{x_{N}(t)+x_{A}(t)+x_{Pr}(t)}{3}=\\frac{x_{A}(t)+x_{Pr}(t)}{3}.\n$$\nWith aging, bone resorption in the maxilla remodels the anterior facial skeleton, shifting $A$ and $Pr$ posteroinferiorly. The magnitude of resorption at a landmark produces a displacement vector whose anterior (sagittal) component equals the magnitude of resorption multiplied by the cosine of the angle made with the $x$-axis. Use the following scientifically plausible and self-consistent assumptions:\n\n1. The direction of the resorption vector at subspinale $A$ is constant at an angle $\\theta_{A}=25^{\\circ}$ to the $x$-axis. The age-specific magnitude of resorption at $A$ is piecewise-constant:\n   - For ages $40 \\leq t < 55$ years, $r_{A}(t)=0.06$ millimeters per year.\n   - For ages $55 \\leq t < 70$ years, $r_{A}(t)=0.09$ millimeters per year.\n   - For ages $70 \\leq t \\leq 80$ years, $r_{A}(t)=0.12$ millimeters per year.\n\n2. The direction of the resorption vector at prosthion $Pr$ is constant at an angle $\\theta_{Pr}=70^{\\circ}$ to the $x$-axis. The age-specific magnitude of resorption at $Pr$ is piecewise-constant:\n   - For ages $40 \\leq t < 60$ years, $r_{Pr}(t)=0.22$ millimeters per year.\n   - For ages $60 \\leq t \\leq 80$ years, $r_{Pr}(t)=0.28$ millimeters per year.\n\n3.

The data provided are self-consistent and complete, allowing for a unique solution. The model of midface aging, while simplified, is based on established concepts in cephalometric analysis.\n\nThe primary objective is to compute the total change in the sagittal position of the midface centroid, $\\Delta x_{\\text{centroid}}$, between the ages of $t=40$ and $t=80$ years. This is defined as $\\Delta x_{\\text{centroid}} = x_{\\text{centroid}}(80) - x_{\\text{centroid}}(40)$.\n\nThe position of the centroid at any time $t$ is given by\n$$\nx_{\\text{centroid}}(t) = \\frac{x_{A}(t) + x_{Pr}(t)}{3}\n$$\nwhere $x_A(t)$ and $x_{Pr}(t)$ are the sagittal positions of the subspinale ($A$) and prosthion ($Pr$) landmarks, respectively. The nasion landmark ($N$) is fixed at the origin, $x_N(t)=0$.\n\nThe velocity of the centroid in the sagittal direction is the time derivative of its position:\n$$\nv_{\\text{centroid}}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}x_{\\text{centroid}}(t) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{dx_A(t)}{dt} + \\frac{dx_{Pr}(t)}{dt} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( v_A(t) + v_{Pr}(t) \\right)\n$$\nwhere $v_A(t)$ and $v_{Pr}(t)$ are the sagittal velocities of landmarks $A$ and $Pr$.\n\nThe problem states that bone resorption causes a \"posteroinferior\" shift of the landmarks. Since the anterior direction is positive on the sagittal ($x$) axis, a posterior shift corresponds to a negative velocity. The sagittal component of the velocity is the projection of the resorption rate vector onto the $x$-axis. The instantaneous rate of change of the displacement magnitude is given by $r(t)$. Therefore, the sagittal velocity of a landmark is given by $v(t) = -r(t) \\cos(\\theta)$, where the negative sign accounts for the posterior direction of movement.\n\nFor landmark $A$, the velocity is:\n$$\nv_A(t) = -r_A(t) \\cos(\\theta_A)\n$$\nwith $\\theta_A = 25^{\\circ}$.

The clinical goal is to separate the contribution of brow descent from that of levator aponeurotic weakening to the change in eyelid position. The quantitative measurements obtained are: brow descent of $b = 6.32$ millimeters relative to the neutral brow at the level of the supraorbital rim, and levator function excursion of $L = 12.9$ millimeters measured from downgaze to upgaze. Use the following foundational definitions and linearized mechanical assumptions:\n\n1. Margin reflex distance $1$ (MRD1) is defined as the vertical distance from the corneal light reflex to the upper eyelid margin in primary gaze. Margin reflex distance $2$ (MRD2) is defined as the vertical distance from the corneal light reflex to the lower eyelid margin in primary gaze. Normative values for an adult without ptosis are $MRD1_{\\mathrm{N}} = 4.0$ millimeters and $MRD2_{\\mathrm{N}} = 5.0$ millimeters.\n\n2. For small displacements, the eyelid–brow–frontalis complex can be approximated as a linear system in quasi-static equilibrium. Denote the upward displacement of the upper lid margin (which increases MRD1) by $x_{u}$ and the upward displacement of the lower lid margin (which increases MRD2) by $x_{l}$.\n\n3. Under a Hooke-type linearization for soft tissue and aponeurotic compliance, the net upward displacement of the upper lid margin equals the superposition of an upward term proportional to levator function (relative to a normative value) and a downward loading term proportional to brow descent. Let $L_{\\mathrm{N}} = 15.0$ millimeters be the normative levator excursion. Introduce proportionality coefficients $\\lambda = 0.22$ millimeters per millimeter for the levator contribution and $\\kappa = 0.34$ millimeters per millimeter for the brow-loading contribution to the upper lid margin. Hence, when the brow is relaxed at descent $b$, the deviation of MRD1 from $MRD1_{\\mathrm{N}}$ is governed by these linear contributions.\n\n4.
