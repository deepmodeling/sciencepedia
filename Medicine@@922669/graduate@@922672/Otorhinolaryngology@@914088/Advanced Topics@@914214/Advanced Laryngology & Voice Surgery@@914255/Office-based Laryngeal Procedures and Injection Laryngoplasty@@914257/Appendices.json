Topical lidocaine on mucous membranes.\n  2. Infiltrative lidocaine with epinephrine at a ratio of $1:100{,}000$.\n- Safety Principle: Risk of Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST) is governed by *aggregate systemic exposure*.\n- Lidocaine dose limits:\n  - $D_{topical}$: maximum of $3.0\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}$ for topical application.\n  - $D_{infiltrative, no-epi}$: maximum of $4.5\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}$ for infiltrative administration without epinephrine.\n  - $D_{infiltrative, epi}$: maximum of $7.0\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}$ for infiltrative administration with epinephrine.\n- Requirement: Calculate the maximum total mass of lidocaine across both routes, expressed in $\\mathrm{mg}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of pharmacology and clinical anesthesiology. The provided dose limits for lidocaine are standard and reflect the known pharmacokinetic effects of different administration routes and the co-administration of a vasoconstrictor (epinephrine). The concept of \"aggregate systemic exposure\" is central to preventing LAST and correctly points to a single systemic limit rather than independent limits for each administration route. The problem provides all necessary data for a unique solution and contains no contradictions or ambiguities. It is a realistic clinical calculation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the maximum total mass of lidocaine that can be safely administered to a patient undergoing a procedure involving two different routes of administration: topical and infiltrative with epinephrine.\n\nThe central principle, as stated in the problem, is that the risk of Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST) is determined by the \"aggregate systemic exposure.\" This means that the total amount of drug absorbed into the bloodstream from all sources combined must be kept below the toxicity threshold. The provided dose limits are not independent allowances for each route; one cannot simply add the maximum dose for the topical route to the maximum dose for the infiltrative route. Such an action would be clinically dangerous and misinterprets the nature of systemic toxicity.\n\nThe different maximum dose recommendations ($3.0\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}$, $4.5\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}$, and $7.0\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}$) account for the different rates at which lidocaine is absorbed into the systemic circulation from different tissues and under different conditions.\n- Topical application to highly vascular mucous membranes results in rapid absorption, hence the most conservative limit of $3.0\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- Infiltration into tissues has a slower absorption profile.\n- The addition of epinephrine, a vasoconstrictor, significantly reduces local blood flow at the site of injection. This slows the rate of systemic absorption, which allows a larger total mass of the drug to be administered before the peak plasma concentration reaches a toxic level. This is why the limit is highest, at $7.0\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}$, when epinephrine is used.\n\nWhen combining administration routes, the total administered dose from all sources must not exceed the single most generous dose limit applicable to the methods being used. This is because the overall systemic capacity of the patient to metabolize and clear the drug is the ultimate limiting factor, and the $7.0\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}$ limit already accounts for this capacity under the favorable kinetic condition of slowed absorption from the infiltrated site. The rapid absorption from the topical site will contribute to the systemic load, but the total load must remain within the ceiling defined by the $7.0\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}$ guideline.\n\nLet $M_{max, total}$ represent the maximum total mass of lidocaine. Let $m_{patient}$ be the patient's mass, and let $D_{max, overall}$ be the governing maximum specific dose. In this case, since one of the methods involves lidocaine with epinephrine, the overall limit is the one associated with that method.\n\nThe governing maximum specific dose is $D_{max, overall} = D_{infiltrative, epi} = 7.0\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}$.\nThe patient's mass is $m_{patient} = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n\nThe maximum total mass of lidocaine is calculated by multiplying the patient's mass by the governing maximum specific dose:\n$$M_{max, total} = m_{patient} \\times D_{max, overall}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$M_{max, total} = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 7.0\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg}}$$\n$$M_{max, total} = 490\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value of $490$ must be expressed with this precision.\n$$490.0\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThis total mass of $490.0\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ represents the maximum combined amount of lidocaine that can be administered via both the topical and infiltrative routes during the single session without exceeding established safety limits for systemic toxicity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{490.0}\n$$", "id": "5054275"}, {"introduction": "Successful injection laryngoplasty hinges on achieving a precise anatomical correction.

The provided model simplifies the displacement volume to that of a right rectangular prism.\n\nThe volume $V$ of a right rectangular prism is given by the product of its length $L$, height $H$, and width $W$:\n$$V = L \\times H \\times W$$\n\nAccording to the problem statement, these dimensions correspond to:\n- The membranous length, $L = 12$ mm.\n- The superior–inferior contact height, $H = 5.0$ mm.\n- The desired medial shift, which is the width of the prism, $W = 0.64$ mm.\n\nThe principle of volume conservation states that the injected volume is equal to the volume of medial displacement. Therefore, we must calculate the volume of this prism.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the volume formula:\n$$V = (12 \\text{ mm}) \\times (5.0 \\text{ mm}) \\times (0.64 \\text{ mm})$$\n\nFirst, we compute the product of the dimensions:\n$$12 \\times 5.0 = 60.0$$\n$$60.0 \\times 0.64 = 38.4$$\n\nSo, the volume is:\n$$V = 38.4 \\text{ mm}^3$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in microliters ($\\mu$L).
