Consider two geometric outcomes that are often conflated in surgical descriptions: (i) simple area-doubling, meaning the cross-sectional area increases by a factor of $2$ (so $A_1=2A_0$), and (ii) diameter-doubling, meaning the diameter increases by a factor of $2$ (so $d_1=2d_0$).

The distinction between area-doubling and diameter-doubling is a key conceptual point that is valid and important in scaling analyses.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe hydraulic resistance $R$ is given by the Hagen–Poiseuille relationship, stated as a proportionality:\n$$ R \\propto \\frac{L}{r^4} $$\nThis can be written with a constant of proportionality, $k$:\n$$ R = k \\frac{L}{r^4} $$\nThe initial resistance, $R_0$, of the stenotic segment is:\n$$ R_0 = k \\frac{L_0}{r_0^4} $$\nThe final resistance, $R_1$, after the slide tracheoplasty is:\n$$ R_1 = k \\frac{L_1}{r_1^4} $$\nThe ratio of the final resistance to the initial resistance, $R_1/R_0$, is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{k L_1 / r_1^4}{k L_0 / r_0^4} = \\left(\\frac{L_1}{L_0}\\right) \\left(\\frac{r_0}{r_1}\\right)^4 $$\nThe problem states that the length is halved, so $L_1 = L_0/2$, or $L_1/L_0 = 1/2$. Substituting this into the ratio equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{r_0}{r_1}\\right)^4 $$\nWe now analyze the two specified geometric outcomes.\n\n**Scenario (i): Area-doubling**\nIn this case, the final cross-sectional area $A_1$ is twice the initial area $A_0$.\n$$ A_1 = 2 A_0 $$\nUsing the formula for the area of a circle, $A=\\pi r^2$:\n$$ \\pi r_1^2 = 2 (\\pi r_0^2) $$\n$$ r_1^2 = 2 r_0^2 $$\n$$ r_1 = \\sqrt{2} \\, r_0 $$\nNow, we substitute this relationship for $r_1$ into the resistance ratio equation:\n$$ \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{r_0}{\\sqrt{2} \\, r_0}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^4 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{(\\sqrt{2})^4} = \\frac{1}{(2^{1/2})^4} = \\frac{1}{2^2} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nTherefore, for area-doubling:\n$$ \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**Scenario (ii): Diameter-doubling**\nIn this case, the final diameter $d_1$ is twice the initial diameter $d_0$.\n$$ d_1 = 2 d_0 $$\nUsing the relationship between diameter and radius, $d=2r$:\n$$ 2 r_1 = 2 (2 r_0) $$\n$$ r_1 = 2 r_0 $$\nWe substitute this new relationship for $r_1$ into the resistance ratio equation:\n$$ \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{r_0}{2 r_0}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{16} $$\nTherefore, for diameter-doubling:\n$$ \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{32} $$\n\nThe analysis confirms that the two scenarios yield substantially different reductions in resistance because of the strong dependence of resistance on the radius ($R \\propto r^{-4}$).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. With $L_1=L_0/2$, area-doubling gives $R_1/R_0=1/8$ and diameter-doubling gives $R_1/R_0=1/32$; the distinction arises because $A\\propto r^2$ and $R\\propto L/r^4$, so doubling area implies $r_1=\\sqrt{2}\\,r_0$, while doubling diameter implies $r_1=2r_0$.**\nThis statement's calculated resistance ratios, $R_1/R_0 = 1/8$ for area-doubling and $R_1/R_0 = 1/32$ for diameter-doubling, exactly match our derivations. The reasoning provided is also correct: the distinction is rooted in the nonlinear relationship between area ($A \\propto r^2$) and resistance ($R \\propto r^{-4}$). It correctly identifies that area-doubling implies an increase in radius by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$, while diameter-doubling implies an increase in radius by a factor of a factor of $2$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. With $L_1=L_0/2$, area-doubling gives $R_1/R_0=1/4$ and diameter-doubling gives $R_1/R_0=1/8$, because resistance scales inversely with $r^2$ rather than $r^4$.**\nThe resistance ratios calculated here are incorrect. The reasoning provided, that $R \\propto r^{-2}$, explicitly contradicts the Hagen–Poiseuille relationship ($R \\propto r^{-4}$) given in the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. With $L_1=L_0/2$, both area-doubling and diameter-doubling yield $R_1/R_0=1/16$ because resistance depends only on cross-sectional area and not on length when flow is laminar.**\nThis statement makes two incorrect claims. First, as derived, the two scenarios yield different resistance ratios ($1/8$ and $1/32$). Second, the reasoning that resistance is independent of length contradicts the Hagen–Poiseuille relationship, where $R \\propto L$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. With $L_1=L_0/2$, the benefit of increasing radius is nullified by shortening, so area-doubling and diameter-doubling reduce resistance to the same ratio $R_1/R_0=1/2$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The resistance reduction from shortening the length to $L_1 = L_0/2$ would, by itself, result in $R_1/R_0=1/2$. Any increase in radius further reduces the resistance. The effects are multiplicative, not nullifying. The calculated ratio of $1/2$ ignores the significant benefit of lumen enlargement, and the claim that both scenarios result in the same ratio is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. With $L_1=L_0/2$, area-doubling yields $R_1/R_0=1/8$, but diameter-doubling triggers turbulent flow that negates any additional reduction beyond $R_1/R_0=1/8$ under clinical airflow conditions.**\nWhile the first part of the statement (area-doubling gives $R_1/R_0 = 1/8$) is correct, the second part introduces a physical phenomenon, turbulence, that is explicitly excluded by the problem's primary assumption to \"Assume steady, laminar airflow\". The task is to perform a calculation based *only* on the provided first principles and assumptions. This option violates this constraint by introducing an external, unstated complexity.

This fourth-power dependence means that any change in radius will have a much more pronounced effect on resistance than a proportional change in length. Therefore, the luminal radius $r$ is the dominant geometric factor determining resistance.\n\n### Analysis of Growth Scenarios\n\n**Scenario 1: Normal Proportional Growth**\nIn this scenario, the transformations over one year are $L \\to L_1 = gL_0$ and $r \\to r_1 = gr_0$.

The application to airflow in the trachea is a standard and valid biomechanical modeling approach. The given values for tracheal dimensions, respiratory parameters, and air viscosity are physiologically and physically realistic for a pediatric case. The assumption of laminar flow is a reasonable and explicitly stated simplification for modeling this scenario.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters and a clear set of instructions to derive a unique, deterministic solution. The method for handling the non-uniform pre-operative geometry (integration of the local resistance) is explicitly defined, removing ambiguity.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and objective terms, free from subjective or speculative content.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe primary task is to compute the ratio of the pressure drops required to achieve the same volumetric flow rate $Q$ before and after the tracheoplasty. First, we determine the required constant volumetric flow rate $Q$ from the given tidal volume $V_{T}$ and inspiratory time $t_{\\text{inspire}}$.\n\nThe given values are converted to SI units:\n$V_{T} = 80\\,\\text{mL} = 80 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{L} = 80 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}^3$\n$t_{\\text{inspire}} = 1.0\\,\\text{s}$\n\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is:\n$$Q = \\frac{V_{T}}{t_{\\text{inspire}}} = \\frac{80 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}^3}{1.0\\,\\text{s}} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}^3\\text{/s}$$\n\nNow we construct the expressions for the pressure drop pre- and post-operatively.\n\n**Post-operative Pressure Drop ($\\Delta P_{\\text{post}}$)**\nAfter the surgery, the trachea is modeled as a uniform cylinder of length $L_{\\text{post}}$ and radius $r_{\\text{post}}$.\n$L_{\\text{post}} = 10\\,\\text{mm} = 0.010\\,\\text{m}$\n$r_{\\text{post}} = 4.0\\,\\text{mm} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\nThe Hagen–Poiseuille equation directly gives the relationship between flow rate and pressure drop:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{post}} \\pi r_{\\text{post}}^{4}}{8 \\mu L_{\\text{post}}}$$\nSolving for $\\Delta P_{\\text{post}}$, we get:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{8 \\mu L_{\\text{post}} Q}{\\pi r_{\\text{post}}^4}$$\n\n**Pre-operative Pressure Drop ($\\Delta P_{\\text{pre}}$)**\nBefore the surgery, the stenotic segment is modeled as a tapered tube of length $L_{\\text{pre}}$. The radius $r(x)$ varies linearly with the axial position $x$ from $x=0$ to $x=L_{\\text{pre}}$.\n$L_{\\text{pre}} = 20\\,\\text{mm} = 0.020\\,\\text{m}$\n$r_a = 1.5\\,\\text{mm} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\n$r_b = 2.5\\,\\text{mm} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\n\nThe linear function for the radius is:\n$$r(x) = r_a + (r_b - r_a) \\frac{x}{L_{\\text{pre}}}$$\nTo find the total pressure drop, we consider a differential element of length $dx$ at position $x$. The local pressure drop $dP$ across this element is given by the differential form of the Hagen–Poiseuille law:\n$$Q = -\\frac{dP}{dx} \\frac{\\pi [r(x)]^4}{8 \\mu}$$\nThe total pressure drop $\\Delta P_{\\text{pre}} = P(0) - P(L_{\\text{pre}})$ is found by integrating $dP$ over the length of the tube:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{pre}} = \\int_{0}^{L_{\\text{pre}}} -\\frac{dP}{dx} dx = \\int_{0}^{L_{\\text{pre}}} \\frac{8 \\mu Q}{\\pi [r(x)]^4} dx$$\nSince $8$, $\\mu$, $Q$, and $\\pi$ are constants, we can pull them out of the integral:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{8 \\mu Q}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{L_{\\text{pre}}} \\frac{1}{\\left(r_a + \\frac{r_b - r_a}{L_{\\text{pre}}}x\\right)^4} dx$$\nTo solve the integral, we perform a change of variable. Let $u = r_a + \\frac{r_b - r_a}{L_{\\text{pre}}}x$. Then $du = \\frac{r_b - r_a}{L_{\\text{pre}}}dx$, which gives $dx = \\frac{L_{\\text{pre}}}{r_b - r_a}du$. The limits of integration become $u(0)=r_a$ and $u(L_{\\text{pre}})=r_b$.\n\\begin{align*} \\Delta P_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{8 \\mu Q}{\\pi} \\int_{r_a}^{r_b} u^{-4} \\left(\\frac{L_{\\text{pre}}}{r_b - r_a}\\right) du \\\\ = \\frac{8 \\mu Q L_{\\text{pre}}}{\\pi(r_b - r_a)} \\left[ \\frac{u^{-3}}{-3} \\right]_{r_a}^{r_b} \\\\ = \\frac{8 \\mu Q L_{\\text{pre}}}{-3\\pi(r_b - r_a)} (r_b^{-3} - r_a^{-3}) \\\\ = \\frac{8 \\mu Q L_{\\text{pre}}}{3\\pi(r_b - r_a)} (r_a^{-3} - r_b^{-3}) \\\\ = \\frac{8 \\mu Q L_{\\text{pre}}}{3\\pi(r_b - r_a)} \\left(\\frac{1}{r_a^3} - \\frac{1}{r_b^3}\\right)\\end{align*}\n\n**Ratio of Pressure Drops**\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $\\Delta P_{\\text{pre}} / \\Delta P_{\\text{post}}$.\n$$\\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{pre}}}{\\Delta P_{\\text{post}}} = \\frac{\\frac{8 \\mu Q L_{\\text{pre}}}{3\\pi(r_b - r_a)} \\left(\\frac{1}{r_a^3} - \\frac{1}{r_b^3}\\right)}{\\frac{8 \\mu L_{\\text{post}} Q}{\\pi r_{\\text{post}}^4}}$$\nThe terms $8$, $\\mu$, $Q$, and $\\pi$ cancel, simplifying the expression significantly.
