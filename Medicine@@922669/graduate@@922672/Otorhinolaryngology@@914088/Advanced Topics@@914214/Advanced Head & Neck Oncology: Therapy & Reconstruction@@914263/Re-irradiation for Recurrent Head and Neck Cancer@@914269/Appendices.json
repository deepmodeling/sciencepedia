The analysis is based on the linear-quadratic (LQ) model.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of BED and EQD2 Expressions**\n\nThe linear-quadratic model describes the fraction of cells, $S$, surviving a dose $d$ as:\n$$ S = \\exp(-(\\alpha d + \\beta d^2)) $$\nThe biological effect, $E$, is given by the natural logarithm of the total cell kill, which is $-\\ln(S)$. For a treatment course of $n$ fractions, each with a dose $d$, the total effect is:\n$$ E = n(\\alpha d + \\beta d^2) $$\nThis expression can be rewritten by factoring out $\\alpha$:\n$$ E = n\\alpha\\left(d + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}d^2\\right) = \\alpha \\cdot nd\\left(1 + \\frac{d}{\\alpha/\\beta}\\right) $$\n\n**Derivation of Biologically Effective Dose (BED):**\nThe BED is defined as a measure of the total biological damage from a radiation course, normalized by the linear component of cell kill, $\\alpha$. It represents the total dose that would be required to produce the same biological effect if given in an infinite number of infinitesimally small fractions (i.e., where the quadratic component of damage, $\\beta d^2$, vanishes). The effect $E$ can be expressed in terms of BED as:\n$$ E = \\alpha \\cdot BED $$\nBy equating the two expressions for the effect $E$, we have:\n$$ \\alpha \\cdot BED = \\alpha \\cdot nd\\left(1 + \\frac{d}{\\alpha/\\beta}\\right) $$\nDividing by $\\alpha$ (which is non-zero) yields the general formula for BED:\n$$ BED = nd\\left(1 + \\frac{d}{\\alpha/\\beta}\\right) $$\nHere, $D = nd$ is the total physical dose.\n\n**Derivation of Equivalent Dose in $2 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}$ fractions (EQD2):**\nThe EQD2 is the total physical dose that would provide the same biological effect as the schedule in question, if that dose were delivered in standard fractions of $d_{ref} = 2 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}$. This concept allows for the comparison of different fractionation schemes on an iso-effective basis.\n\nThe principle of iso-effect states that the BED of the schedule of interest must equal the BED of the equivalent reference schedule.\nLet the schedule of interest have $n$ fractions of dose $d$. Its BED is:\n$$ BED_{schedule} = nd\\left(1 + \\frac{d}{\\alpha/\\beta}\\right) $$\nLet the reference schedule have a total dose of EQD2, delivered in fractions of size $d_{ref} = 2 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}$. The number of fractions in this reference schedule, $n_{ref}$, would be $EQD2 / d_{ref}$. The BED of this reference schedule is:\n$$ BED_{ref} = n_{ref} d_{ref} \\left(1 + \\frac{d_{ref}}{\\alpha/\\beta}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{EQD2}{d_{ref}}\\right) d_{ref} \\left(1 + \\frac{d_{ref}}{\\alpha/\\beta}\\right) $$\n$$ BED_{ref} = EQD2\\left(1 + \\frac{d_{ref}}{\\alpha/\\beta}\\right) $$\nSetting $BED_{schedule} = BED_{ref}$:\n$$ nd\\left(1 + \\frac{d}{\\alpha/\\beta}\\right) = EQD2\\left(1 + \\frac{d_{ref}}{\\alpha/\\beta}\\right) $$\nSolving for EQD2, we get:\n$$ EQD2 = \\frac{nd\\left(1 + d/(\\alpha/\\beta)\\right)}{1 + d_{ref}/(\\alpha/\\beta)} = \\frac{BED}{1 + d_{ref}/(\\alpha/\\beta)} $$\nSubstituting the standard reference fraction size $d_{ref} = 2 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}$, the formula for EQD2 becomes:\n$$ EQD2 = \\frac{BED}{1 + 2/(\\alpha/\\beta)} $$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation for the Given Schedule**\n\nThe problem provides the following parameters for the SBRT re-irradiation schedule:\n- Total dose, $D = 40 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}$\n- Number of fractions, $n = 5$\n- Tumor $\\alpha/\\beta$ ratio, $(\\alpha/\\beta)_{tumor} = 10 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}$\n\nFrom these, we can calculate the dose per fraction, $d$:\n$$ d = \\frac{D}{n} = \\frac{40 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}}{5} = 8 \\, \\mathrm{Gy} $$\n\nNow, we calculate the tumor $BED_{10}$ (where the subscript $10$ denotes the $\\alpha/\\beta$ value of $10 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}$):\n$$ BED_{10} = nd\\left(1 + \\frac{d}{\\alpha/\\beta}\\right) = (5 \\times 8) \\left(1 + \\frac{8}{10}\\right) $$\n$$ BED_{10} = 40 \\left(1 + 0.8\\right) = 40 \\times 1.8 $$\n$$ BED_{10} = 72 \\, \\mathrm{Gy} $$\n\nNext, we use this $BED_{10}$ value to calculate the tumor EQD2:\n$$ EQD2 = \\frac{BED_{10}}{1 + 2/(\\alpha/\\beta)} = \\frac{72}{1 + 2/10} $$\n$$ EQD2 = \\frac{72}{1 + 0.2} = \\frac{72}{1.2} $$\n$$ EQD2 = 60 \\, \\mathrm{Gy} $$\n\n**Part 3: Radiobiological Assessment of Ablative Potential**\n\nThe term \"ablative\" in the context of SBRT implies a very high dose of radiation intended to eradicate the tumor with a high probability of local control (typically exceeding $85-90 \\%$). A widely cited radiobiological benchmark for an ablative dose for macroscopic tumors is a tumor $BED_{10}$ of at least $100 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}$.\n\nThe calculated tumor $BED_{10}$ for the given schedule of $40 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}$ in $5$ fractions is $72 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}$. This value is substantially lower than the commonly accepted ablative threshold of $100 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}_{10}$.\n\nSeveral factors reinforce the conclusion that this schedule is unlikely to be ablative:\n1.  **Re-irradiation Setting**: Tumors that recur after a high-dose course of radiotherapy (initial treatment was $70 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}$) may contain a higher proportion of radioresistant cells. Achieving control in this setting often requires an even higher biological dose than for a primary tumor of the same size. The initial treatment of $70 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}$ in $35$ fractions ($d=2 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}$) had a $BED_{10} = 70(1 + 2/10) = 84 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}$. The proposed re-irradiation schedule has a lower BED than the initial curative-intent treatment, which ultimately failed.\n2.  **Tumor Size**: The target is a $2 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$ nodal recurrence. This is not a small lesion and contains a significant number of clonogenic tumor cells (on the order of $10^8$ to $10^9$ cells). Larger tumor volumes generally require higher doses to achieve the same probability of control due to this greater cell burden and potential for radioresistant subpopulations (e.g., hypoxic cells).\n3.  **Comparison to Ablative Schedules**: Standard ablative SBRT schedules, such as $50 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}$ in $5$ fractions for lung cancer, deliver a $BED_{10} = 50(1+10/10) = 100 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}_{10}$. Another example, $54 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}$ in $3$ fractions, delivers a $BED_{10} = 54(1+18/10) = 151.2 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}_{10}$. The proposed schedule is clearly less potent.\n\nIn conclusion, based on fundamental radiobiological principles, the calculated $BED_{10}$ of $72 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}$ is well below the benchmark for ablative therapy. Therefore, the SBRT schedule of $40 \\, \\mathrm{Gy}$ in $5$ fractions is not likely to be ablative for a $2 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$ nodal recurrence in the re-irradiation setting. It would be more appropriately characterized as a high-dose, potentially tumor-debulking or 'palliative-plus' regimen, aimed at achieving a durable response and symptom control rather than guaranteed local eradication. The choice of this dose level in clinical practice would heavily factor in the tolerance of nearby critical normal tissues, which are more sensitive after previous irradiation and often limit the ability to deliver a truly ablative dose.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 72 & 60 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "5067041"}, {"introduction": "Re-irradiation planning is fundamentally constrained by the tolerance of normal tissues that have already received a significant radiation dose.
