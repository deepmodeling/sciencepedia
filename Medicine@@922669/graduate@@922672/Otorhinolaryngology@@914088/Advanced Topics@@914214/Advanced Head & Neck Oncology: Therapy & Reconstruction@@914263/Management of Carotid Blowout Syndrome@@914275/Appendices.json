The clinical team is concerned about Carotid Blowout Syndrome (CBS), specifically a carotid pseudoaneurysm that may herald impending rupture. Based on risk stratification incorporating sentinel bleeding, exposed vasculature, and necrotic wound bed, the pretest probability for a carotid pseudoaneurysm is estimated as $p_{0} = 0.35$. Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) is performed and is read as positive for pseudoaneurysm.

The clinical scenario (Carotid Blowout Syndrome in a post-radiation head and neck cancer patient) is realistic, and the use of sensitivity, specificity, and pretest probability to calculate a post-test probability is a standard and valid methodology in evidence-based medicine.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters ($p_0$, $S_{\\mathrm{ens}}$, $S_{\\mathrm{pec}}$) to calculate the desired quantity (a posterior probability). The question is clear and has a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, clinical, and mathematical language. It is free from subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that the patient has a carotid pseudoaneurysm.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) is positive.\nThe givens can be formally expressed in probabilistic terms:\nThe prior probability of having a pseudoaneurysm is $P(A) = p_{0} = 0.35$.\nThe sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the condition: $S_{\\mathrm{ens}} = P(T^+ \\mid A) = 0.92$.\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the condition. Let $A^c$ denote the event that the patient does not have a pseudoaneurysm. Then, $S_{\\mathrm{pec}} = P(T^- \\mid A^c) = 0.88$, where $T^-$ represents a negative test result.\n\nThe objective is to find the posterior probability $P(A \\mid T^+)$, which is the probability that the patient has a pseudoaneurysm given that the CTA is positive. We utilize Bayes' theorem for this purpose:\n$$P(A \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid A) P(A)}{P(T^+)}$$\nTo use this formula, we must first calculate the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$, using the Law of Total Probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid A) P(A) + P(T^+ \\mid A^c) P(A^c)$$\nWe are given $P(T^+ \\mid A)$ and $P(A)$. We need to determine the other two terms, $P(T^+ \\mid A^c)$ and $P(A^c)$.\n\nThe probability of not having a pseudoaneurysm, $P(A^c)$, is the complement of the prior probability $P(A)$:\n$$P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.35 = 0.65$$\nThe term $P(T^+ \\mid A^c)$ represents the probability of a positive test given the absence of the condition, which is the false positive rate. This is the complement of the specificity, $S_{\\mathrm{pec}}$, because for a patient without the condition, the test can only be negative (true negative) or positive (false positive).\n$$P(T^+ \\mid A^c) = 1 - P(T^- \\mid A^c) = 1 - S_{\\mathrm{pec}} = 1 - 0.88 = 0.12$$\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formula for the total probability $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.92)(0.35) + (0.12)(0.65)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.322 + 0.078 = 0.400$$\nHaving found $P(T^+)$, we can now compute the posterior probability $P(A \\mid T^+)$ using Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(A \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid A) P(A)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{(0.92)(0.35)}{0.400}$$\n$$P(A \\mid T^+) = \\frac{0.322}{0.400} = 0.805$$\nThe problem requires the final probability to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $0.805$, which, to four significant figures, is written as $0.8050$.\n\nThe derived analytical expression for the posterior probability, in terms of the given parameters, is:\n$$P(A \\mid T^+) = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{ens}} \\cdot p_{0}}{S_{\\mathrm{ens}} \\cdot p_{0} + (1 - S_{\\mathrm{pec}})(1 - p_{0})}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(\\mathrm{pseudoaneurysm}\\mid \\mathrm{CTA} +) = \\frac{(0.92)(0.35)}{(0.92)(0.35) + (1-0.88)(1-0.35)} = \\frac{0.322}{0.322 + (0.12)(0.65)} = \\frac{0.322}{0.322 + 0.078} = \\frac{0.322}{0.400} = 0.8050$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8050}$$", "id": "5039823"}, {"introduction": "In the face of active hemorrhage from CBS, rapid and effective resuscitation is paramount to survival.
