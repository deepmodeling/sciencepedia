Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) is defined as the number of nonsynonymous somatic mutations per megabase of coding DNA. Consider a tumor with TMB equal to $8$ nonsynonymous mutations per megabase and an exome capture size of $32$ megabases. Assume that each nonsynonymous mutation independently results in at least one Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I-presented epitope on the tumor cell surface with probability $p = 0.12$, reflecting the combined probability of expression, processing, transport, and binding sufficient for presentation.

No units are required.", "solution": "The problem statement will be validated before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Definition of Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB):** The number of nonsynonymous somatic mutations per megabase of coding DNA.\n-   **Value of TMB:** $8$ nonsynonymous mutations per megabase.\n-   **Exome capture size:** $32$ megabases.\n-   **Assumption of Independence:** Each nonsynonymous mutation independently results in a presented epitope.\n-   **Probability of Presentation ($p$):** The probability that a single nonsynonymous mutation results in at least one Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I-presented epitope is $p = 0.12$.\n-   **Objective:** Derive the expected number of presented neoepitopes for this tumor.\n-   **Required Output Format:** A single real-valued number, rounded to three significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the established criteria.\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is scientifically grounded. TMB, HLA presentation, and neoepitopes are fundamental concepts in immuno-oncology. The provided values for TMB ($8$ mut/Mb), exome size ($32$ Mb), and presentation probability ($0.12$) are within plausible biological ranges for modeling purposes. The definition of TMB is standard.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It requests the calculation of an expected value, a well-defined mathematical quantity. All necessary parameters (TMB, exome size, and probability) are provided to arrive at a unique solution.\n-   **Objective:** The language is precise and quantitative, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The setup is complete and internally consistent. There is no missing information required for the calculation, nor are there any contradictory constraints.\n-   **Realism:** The scenario is a simplified but realistic model used in computational immunology to estimate neoantigen load from genomic data. The assumption of independence is a common simplifying assumption in such first-order models.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity conditions. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and formalizable problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the expected number of presented neoepitopes. This can be achieved in two main steps: first, determining the total number of nonsynonymous mutations in the tumor, and second, applying the principles of probability to find the expected number that are successfully presented.\n\nLet $T_{MB}$ be the Tumor Mutation Burden, given as $8$ mutations per megabase.\nLet $S_{exome}$ be the size of the exome, given as $32$ megabases.\n\nThe total number of nonsynonymous somatic mutations, denoted by $N_{mut}$, is the product of the TMB and the exome size.\n$$\nN_{mut} = T_{MB} \\times S_{exome}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nN_{mut} = 8 \\frac{\\text{mutations}}{\\text{megabase}} \\times 32 \\text{ megabases} = 256 \\text{ mutations}\n$$\nSo, there are $256$ nonsynonymous mutations in total.\n\nLet $N_{p}$ be the random variable representing the number of presented neoepitopes. For each of the $N_{mut}$ mutations, we can define an indicator (Bernoulli) random variable, $X_i$, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N_{mut}\\}$.\nLet $X_i = 1$ if the $i$-th mutation is presented as a neoepitope on the cell surface, and $X_i = 0$ otherwise.\n\nThe problem states that the probability of a single mutation being successfully presented is $p = 0.12$. Thus, for each $i$:\n$$\nP(X_i = 1) = p = 0.12\n$$\n$$\nP(X_i = 0) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88\n$$\nThe expected value of each individual indicator variable $E[X_i]$ is:\n$$\nE[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i = 1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i = 0) = 1 \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = p\n$$\nThe total number of presented neoepitopes, $N_{p}$, is the sum of these individual indicator variables:\n$$\nN_p = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{mut}} X_i\n$$\nWe seek the expected value of $N_p$, which is $E[N_p]$. By the linearity of expectation, the expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expected values. This property holds regardless of whether the variables are independent, although the problem statement provides the condition of independence.\n$$\nE[N_p] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{mut}} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{mut}} E[X_i]\n$$\nSince $E[X_i] = p$ for all $i$, we have:\n$$\nE[N_p] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{mut}} p = N_{mut} \\times p\n$$\nNow, we substitute the calculated value for $N_{mut}$ and the given value for $p$:\n$$\nE[N_p] = 256 \\times 0.12\n$$\nCalculating this product:\n$$\nE[N_p] = 30.72\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The number $30.72$ has four significant figures. Rounding to three significant figures gives $30.7$.\n\nTherefore, the expected number of presented neoepitopes for this tumor is $30.7$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{30.7}$$", "id": "5034878"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the theoretical basis of immunogenicity to daily clinical practice, the most critical predictive biomarker for checkpoint inhibitors in HNSCC is the expression of Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1).

Initially, Nadir SLD = $SLD_{baseline}$.\n- **immune Partial Response (iPR):** At least a $30\\%$ decrease in SLD of target lesions relative to baseline.\n- **immune Unconfirmed Progressive Disease (iUPD):** The initial observation of progression, defined by RECIST $1.1$ criteria:\n    1.  At least a $20\\%$ increase in SLD relative to nadir (with an absolute increase of at least $5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$).\n    2.  OR unequivocal progression of non-target lesions.\n    3.  OR the appearance of one or more new lesions.\n- **immune Confirmed Progressive Disease (iCPD):** iUPD that is confirmed by further progression at a subsequent assessment (typically $4-8$ weeks later). Confirmation requires one of: further increase in SLD, increase in size of new lesion(s), or appearance of additional new lesions.\n- **immune Stable Disease (iSD):** Any case not qualifying for iPR or iUPD/iCPD.\n\n**Analysis at 8 Weeks:**\n\n1.  **Target Lesion Assessment:**\n    - Baseline SLD: $SLD_{baseline} = 60\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This is the initial nadir.\n    - SLD at $8$ weeks: $SLD_{8wk} = 76\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    - Percentage change from nadir:\n      $$ \\text{Change} = \\frac{SLD_{8wk} - SLD_{baseline}}{SLD_{baseline}} = \\frac{76 - 60}{60} = \\frac{16}{60} \\approx 0.267 = 26.7\\% $$\n    - The percentage increase ($26.7\\%$) is greater than the $20\\%$ threshold.\n    - The absolute increase is $76\\,\\mathrm{mm} - 60\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 16\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, which is greater than the $5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ threshold.\n    - Thus, based on target lesions alone, the criteria for progression are met.\n\n2.  **New Lesion Assessment:**\n    - Two new lesions are observed. For a lymph node to be considered a measurable lesion, its short axis must be $\\ge 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    - The new node with a short axis of $12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ qualifies as a new measurable lesion. The appearance of a new lesion is a criterion for progression.\n\n3.  **Overall Response Classification at 8 Weeks:**\n    - The patient meets progression criteria by both target lesion growth and the appearance of a new lesion.\n    - Since this is the first time progression is observed, the official iRECIST classification is **immune Unconfirmed Progressive Disease (iUPD)**.\n\n4.  **Management Decision at 8 Weeks:**\n    - The iRECIST guidelines recommend that for a patient with iUPD who is clinically stable (as stated in the problem), immunotherapy should be continued, and a confirmatory scan should be performed in $4-8$ weeks to assess for iCPD.\n\n**Analysis at 16 Weeks:**\n\n1.  **Re-assessment of Progression:**\n    - The scan at $16$ weeks serves to confirm or refute the iUPD from $8$ weeks. To confirm progression (iCPD), there must be evidence of further growth.\n    - Target Lesions: The SLD decreased from $76\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ at the iUPD time point to $54\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This does not confirm progression.\n    - New Lesions: The new lesions seen at $8$ weeks have either shrunk (from $12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ to $9\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) or resolved (the $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ node is gone). This does not confirm progression.\n    - No additional new lesions are reported.\n    - Conclusion: The progression is **not confirmed**. The iUPD status is reversed. The response must be re-categorized based on the current state.\n\n2.  **Overall Response Classification at 16 Weeks:**\n    - With iUPD unconfirmed, the response is determined by the overall tumor burden relative to baseline.\n    - Target Lesion Assessment vs. Baseline:\n      - $SLD_{baseline} = 60\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n      - $SLD_{16wk} = 54\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n      - Percentage change from baseline:\n        $$ \\text{Change} = \\frac{SLD_{16wk} - SLD_{baseline}}{SLD_{baseline}} = \\frac{54 - 60}{60} = \\frac{-6}{60} = -0.10 = -10\\% $$\n    - A $10\\%$ decrease in SLD does not meet the $\\ge 30\\%$ decrease required for iPR.\n    - Since the patient does not qualify for iPR and progression (iUPD) has been ruled out at this time point, the response is classified as **immune Stable Disease (iSD)**. The management would be to continue immunotherapy.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A. $8$ weeks: immune confirmed progressive disease (iCPD); stop immunotherapy. $16$ weeks: progressive disease persists.**\n  - **8 weeks:** The classification is incorrect. The first evidence of progression is iUPD, not iCPD. The management recommendation is also incorrect for a stable patient with iUPD.\n  - **16 weeks:** The classification is incorrect. The tumor burden decreased, which is the opposite of persistent progression.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **B. $8$ weeks: immune unconfirmed progressive disease (iUPD); continue immunotherapy if clinically stable. $16$ weeks: immune stable disease (iSD); continue immunotherapy.**\n  - **8 weeks:** This correctly identifies the response as iUPD and gives the appropriate management recommendation for a clinically stable patient.\n  - **16 weeks:** This correctly identifies the response as iSD, because progression was not confirmed and the criteria for iPR were not met. Continuing immunotherapy is the correct management.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **C. $8$ weeks: immune unconfirmed progressive disease (iUPD); continue immunotherapy. $16$ weeks: immune partial response (iPR); continue immunotherapy.**\n  - **8 weeks:** The classification and management are correct.\n  - **16 weeks:** The classification is incorrect. The $10\\%$ decrease in SLD from baseline is insufficient to meet the $\\ge 30\\%$ threshold for iPR.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. $8$ weeks: progressive disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version $1.1$ mandates discontinuation; do not continue immunotherapy beyond progression. $16$ weeks: not applicable.**\n  - **8 weeks:** This option fails to apply iRECIST, which is specifically designed for immunotherapy and was requested in the problem. While the patient has progressed by RECIST $1.1$, iRECIST modifies the management, allowing continuation of therapy pending confirmation. The statement that discontinuation is mandated is therefore incorrect in this context.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5034954"}]}
