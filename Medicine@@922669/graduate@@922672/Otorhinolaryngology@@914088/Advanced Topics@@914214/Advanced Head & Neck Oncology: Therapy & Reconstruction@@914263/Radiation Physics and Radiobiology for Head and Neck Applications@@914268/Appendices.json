It is a standard, well-posed problem in medical physics that requires the application of an established statistical margin recipe. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to calculate the isotropic Planning Target Volume (PTV) margin, $M$, required to compensate for geometric setup uncertainties. The PTV is a geometric expansion of the Clinical Target Volume (CTV) intended to ensure that the CTV receives the prescribed dose despite patient setup errors and organ motion.\n\nThe total uncertainty is modeled by two components:\n1.  A systematic error, constant for a given patient over the course of treatment but varying across the patient population, characterized by a standard deviation $\\Sigma$.\n2.  A random error, varying from one treatment fraction to the next, characterized by a standard deviation $\\sigma$.\n\nThe problem specifies a statistical criterion for treatment success and directs the use of a \"well-tested margin formulation\". The most widely adopted and appropriate formulation for this scenario is the van Herk margin recipe. This recipe is specifically designed to satisfy the clinical goal that for a high percentage of the patient population (e.g., $90\\%$), the minimum dose to the CTV is at least a high percentage of the prescribed dose (e.g., $95\\%$). The problem's criterion—\"$0.95$ of the CTV receives the prescribed dose in $0.90$ of patients\"—is a volumetric variant that, under the assumption of a steep dose gradient, is well-approximated by the principles underlying the van Herk formula.\n\nThe van Herk formula is an analytical expression that combines the effects of systematic and random errors:\n$$ M = \\alpha \\Sigma + \\beta \\sigma $$\nThe coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are derived from statistical and physical considerations. We derive them from first principles as requested.\n\n**1. The Systematic Error Component ($\\alpha \\Sigma$)**\nThis term ensures that the CTV is adequately positioned within the high-dose region for a large fraction of the patient population. A systematic error displaces the entire cumulative dose distribution for a patient. We model the systematic error vector $\\vec{S}$ as a three-dimensional random variable, where each component is drawn from a normal distribution with mean $0$ and standard deviation $\\Sigma$. The margin must be large enough to encompass the radial magnitude $|\\vec{S}|$ of this error for $90\\%$ of patients. The probability distribution of the radial error magnitude $r = |\\vec{S}|$ is a Chi distribution with $3$ degrees of freedom.\n\nThe requirement is to find a margin component $M_{\\Sigma}$ such that $P(|\\vec{S}| \\le M_{\\Sigma}) = 0.90$. Numerical evaluation of the cumulative distribution function for the 3D Chi distribution shows that this condition is met when:\n$$ M_{\\Sigma} \\approx 2.5 \\Sigma $$\nThus, the coefficient $\\alpha$ is approximately $2.5$. This accounts for the 3D nature of systematic setup errors and the $90\\%$ population coverage requirement.\n\n**2. The Random Error Component ($\\beta \\sigma$)**\nThis term accounts for the blurring of the cumulative dose distribution due to fraction-to-fraction random errors. Over a course of $N$ fractions, these random displacements do not average out to zero in their dosimetric effect. Instead, they cause the time-averaged dose distribution to be a convolution of the static dose distribution with a Gaussian function of standard deviation $\\sigma$. This convolution effectively widens the dose penumbra. The margin must include an additional component to compensate for this dose blurring, ensuring the prescribed dose level is achieved at the CTV edge.\n\nThrough analysis and extensive Monte Carlo simulations, it has been established that the required margin component to counteract this blurring effect and ensure adequate dose at the CTV boundary is approximately:\n$$ M_{\\sigma} \\approx 0.7 \\sigma $$\nThus, the coefficient $\\beta$ is approximately $0.7$. This value is largely independent of the number of fractions $N$, provided $N$ is sufficiently large (which $N=33$ is) for the statistical model to be valid.\n\n**3. The Complete Margin Formula**\nCombining these two components gives the well-established van Herk margin formula:\n$$ M = 2.5 \\Sigma + 0.7 \\sigma $$\n\n**Calculation**\nWe are given the following values:\n- Population standard deviation of systematic error: $\\Sigma = 2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Standard deviation of random error: $\\sigma = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$ M = 2.5 \\times (2\\,\\mathrm{mm}) + 0.7 \\times (1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}) $$\n$$ M = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm} + 1.05\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\n$$ M = 6.05\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
