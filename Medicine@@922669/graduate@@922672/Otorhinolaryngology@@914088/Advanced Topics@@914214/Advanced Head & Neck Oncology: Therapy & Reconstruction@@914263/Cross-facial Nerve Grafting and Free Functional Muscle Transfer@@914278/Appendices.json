It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe total time required for the first regenerating axons to traverse the nerve graft, which we denote as $T_{total}$, is the sum of two distinct periods: the initial latency time, $T_0$, and the time required for the axons to travel the length of the graft, $T_{travel}$. As an additional modeling assumption, we posit that these two time components are independent.\n\n$$T_{total} = T_0 + T_{travel}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the expected time to first arrival, which is the mathematical expectation of $T_{total}$, denoted $E[T_{total}]$. By the linearity of the expectation operator, we have:\n\n$$E[T_{total}] = E[T_0 + T_{travel}] = E[T_0] + E[T_{travel}]$$\n\nWe will now derive expressions for each term on the right-hand side.\n\nFirst, we consider the travel time, $T_{travel}$. The problem states that axons advance at a constant average rate $v$ over a distance $L$. Using the definition of constant-velocity motion (distance = rate $\\times$ time), we have:\n\n$$L = v \\cdot T_{travel}$$\n\nSolving for $T_{travel}$ gives:\n\n$$T_{travel} = \\frac{L}{v}$$\n\nSince $L$ and $v$ are given as constants, $T_{travel}$ is a deterministic value, not a random variable. The expectation of a constant is the constant itself:\n\n$$E[T_{travel}] = T_{travel} = \\frac{L}{v}$$\n\nNext, we consider the latency time, $T_0$. This is given as a continuous random variable that is uniformly distributed on the interval $[a, b]$, where $a = 14$ days and $b = 28$ days. The probability density function (PDF) for a uniform distribution on $[a, b]$ is:\n\n$$f_{T_0}(t) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{b-a} & \\text{if } a \\le t \\le b \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\n\nThe expected value (or mean) of a continuous random variable is defined as $E[T_0] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} t \\cdot f_{T_0}(t) \\, dt$. Applying this definition to our specific PDF:\n\n$$E[T_0] = \\int_{a}^{b} t \\cdot \\frac{1}{b-a} \\, dt$$\n\nWe can factor out the constant term $\\frac{1}{b-a}$ and perform the integration:\n\n$$E[T_0] = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\int_{a}^{b} t \\, dt = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\left[ \\frac{t^2}{2} \\right]_{a}^{b}$$\n\nEvaluating the integral at its limits:\n\n$$E[T_0] = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\left( \\frac{b^2}{2} - \\frac{a^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{b^2 - a^2}{2(b-a)}$$\n\nFactoring the numerator as a difference of squares, $(b^2 - a^2) = (b-a)(b+a)$:\n\n$$E[T_0] = \\frac{(b-a)(b+a)}{2(b-a)} = \\frac{a+b}{2}$$\n\nNow we combine the derived expressions for $E[T_0]$ and $E[T_{travel}]$ to find the expression for the expected total time:\n\n$$E[T_{total}] = \\frac{a+b}{2} + \\frac{L}{v}$$\n\nThis is the general symbolic expression for the expected reinnervation time under the given model.\n\nTo compute the numerical value, we substitute the given values:\n- Graft length, $L = 140 \\, \\text{mm}$\n- Growth rate, $v = 1.5 \\, \\text{mm/day}$\n- Latency interval, $[a, b] = [14, 28]$ days\n\nFirst, calculate the expected latency time, $E[T_0]$:\n$$E[T_0] = \\frac{14 + 28}{2} = \\frac{42}{2} = 21 \\text{ days}$$\n\nNext, calculate the travel time, $T_{travel}$:\n$$T_{travel} = \\frac{L}{v} = \\frac{140 \\text{ mm}}{1.5 \\text{ mm/day}} = \\frac{140}{3/2} = \\frac{280}{3} \\text{ days}$$\n\nThe exact value of the travel time is approximately $93.333...$ days.\n\nFinally, the expected total reinnervation time is the sum of these two values:\n$$E[T_{total}] = 21 + \\frac{280}{3} = \\frac{63}{3} + \\frac{280}{3} = \\frac{343}{3} \\text{ days}$$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$E[T_{total}] = 114.3333... \\text{ days}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $1$, $4$, and $3$. Therefore, the rounded value is $114.3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{114.3}$$", "id": "5017235"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the timing of reinnervation, the functional success of an FFMT is directly related to the *quantity* of motor axons that successfully traverse the nerve graft and reach the target muscle.

It is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe instantaneous axonal regeneration speed, $v$, is modeled as a linear function of the distance traversed, $x$. A general linear function has the form $v(x) = mx + c$.\n\nThe parameters $m$ (slope) and $c$ (y-intercept) are determined from the given conditions.\nAt the proximal end, $x=0$, the speed is $v_0$.\n$$v(0) = m(0) + c = v_0 \\implies c = v_0$$\nThe velocity function becomes $v(x) = mx + v_0$.\n\nAt the distal end, $x=L$, the speed is $v_L$.\n$$v(L) = mL + v_0 = v_L$$\nSolving for the slope $m$:\n$$mL = v_L - v_0 \\implies m = \\frac{v_L - v_0}{L}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $m$ and $c$, the complete velocity function is:\n$$v(x) = \\left(\\frac{v_L - v_0}{L}\\right)x + v_0$$\nThe fundamental definition of velocity is $v = \\frac{dx}{dt}$. To find the total time $t$ required to traverse the graft, we can rearrange this differential equation to separate variables:\n$$dt = \\frac{dx}{v(x)}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v(x)$:\n$$dt = \\frac{dx}{\\left(\\frac{v_L - v_0}{L}\\right)x + v_0}$$\nTo find the total time, $T$, we integrate this expression from the starting position $x=0$ to the final position $x=L$.\n$$T = \\int_{0}^{T} dt = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{v_L - v_0}{L}\\right)x + v_0} dx$$\nThis integral is of the form $\\int \\frac{1}{ax+b} dx$, which evaluates to $\\frac{1}{a}\\ln|ax+b|$. Here, $a = \\frac{v_L - v_0}{L}$ and $b = v_0$.\nPerforming the integration:\n$$T = \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{v_L - v_0}{L}\\right)} \\ln\\left| \\left(\\frac{v_L - v_0}{L}\\right)x + v_0 \\right| \\right]_{0}^{L}$$\n$$T = \\frac{L}{v_L - v_0} \\left( \\ln\\left| \\left(\\frac{v_L - v_0}{L}\\right)L + v_0 \\right| - \\ln\\left| \\left(\\frac{v_L - v_0}{L}\\right)0 + v_0 \\right| \\right)$$\nSimplifying the terms inside the logarithms:\n$$T = \\frac{L}{v_L - v_0} \\left( \\ln|v_L - v_0 + v_0| - \\ln|v_0| \\right)$$\n$$T = \\frac{L}{v_L - v_0} (\\ln|v_L| - \\ln|v_0|)$$\nSince speeds $v_L$ and $v_0$ are positive magnitudes, the absolute value signs can be dropped.

This is the time required for the fastest-growing axons to traverse the entire nerve graft and reach the distal end, making it \"live\" and ready for connection to the nerve of the transferred muscle.\n\n1.  **Staging of Surgery**: Surgeons must wait at least this long before performing the second stage. In practice, a longer waiting period of $6$ to $9$ months is common to allow for a greater density of regenerating axons to populate the distal end of the graft, increasing the chances of successful muscle reinnervation. The calculation provides a quantitative basis for this minimum waiting time.\n\n2.  **Motor Endplate Viability**: After the FFMT (Stage $2$), the transferred muscle is denervated and its motor endplates begin to degrade. There is a critical window, typically considered to be $12$ to $18$ months, within which the muscle must be reinnervated to restore function. The total time to reinnervation is the sum of the time to cross the CFNG ($T_{CFNG} \\approx 4$ months), plus the subsequent time for axons to cross the nerve of the transferred muscle and form functional neuromuscular junctions ($T_{NMJ}$). This model highlights that a longer or less efficient graft (lower $v_L$) consumes a significant portion of the viable window even before the target muscle is transferred, underscoring the importance of using the shortest possible graft and optimizing the biological environment for regeneration. The non-linear effect of length on time in this model (due to the logarithmic term) further emphasizes this clinical imperative.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{125.7}\n$$", "id": "5017318"}]}
