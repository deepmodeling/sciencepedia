For an inhibitor, the fractional effect (in this case, fractional inhibition of kinase activity) is given by the Hill equation for inhibition. Let $I(D)$ be the fraction of kinase activity that is inhibited at a drug concentration $D$. This is given by:\n$$\nI(D) = \\frac{D^n}{IC_{50}^n + D^n}\n$$\nHere, $D$ is the inhibitor concentration, $IC_{50}$ is the concentration that produces half-maximal inhibition, and $n$ is the Hill coefficient describing the steepness of the dose-response curve (cooperativity). This form correctly yields $I(D) = 1/2$ when $D=IC_{50}$.\n\nThe problem asks for $f_{\\mathrm{AKT}}(D)$, which is defined as the *fraction of pAKT activity relative to baseline*. This is the remaining, or uninhibited, fraction of activity. If the baseline activity (at $D=0$) is normalized to $1$, then the remaining activity fraction is:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{AKT}}(D) = 1 - I(D)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I(D)$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{AKT}}(D) = 1 - \\frac{D^n}{IC_{50}^n + D^n}\n$$\nTo combine the terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{AKT}}(D) = \\frac{(IC_{50}^n + D^n) - D^n}{IC_{50}^n + D^n} = \\frac{IC_{50}^n}{IC_{50}^n + D^n}\n$$\nThis is the explicit expression for the fraction of pAKT activity, $f_{\\mathrm{AKT}}(D)$, in terms of $D$, $IC_{50}$, and $n$. We can verify its properties:\n-   As $D \\to 0$, $f_{\\mathrm{AKT}}(D) \\to \\frac{IC_{50}^n}{IC_{50}^n + 0} = 1$, corresponding to full baseline activity.\n-   When $D = IC_{50}$, $f_{\\mathrm{AKT}}(D) = \\frac{IC_{50}^n}{IC_{50}^n + IC_{50}^n} = \\frac{1}{2}$, corresponding to half activity.\n-   As $D \\to \\infty$, $f_{\\mathrm{AKT}}(D) \\to 0$, corresponding to complete inhibition.\nThe derived expression is correct.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the net proliferation rate $r(D)$**\n\nThe net proliferation rate $r(D)$ is given by the relationship:\n$$\nr(D) = r_{0}\\left[f_{\\mathrm{AKT}}(D)\\right]^{\\beta}\n$$\nWe substitute the derived expression for $f_{\\mathrm{AKT}}(D)$ into this equation:\n$$\nr(D) = r_{0} \\left( \\frac{IC_{50}^n}{IC_{50}^n + D^n} \\right)^{\\beta}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values:\n-   $r_{0} = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n-   $\\beta = 1.5$\n-   $n = 2$\n-   $D = 0.30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n-   $IC_{50} = 0.10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the value of $f_{\\mathrm{AKT}}(D)$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{AKT}}(D) = \\frac{(0.10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^2}{(0.10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^2 + (0.30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})^2}\n$$\nThe units of concentration cancel out, as expected:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{AKT}}(D) = \\frac{(0.10)^2}{(0.10)^2 + (0.30)^2} = \\frac{0.01}{0.01 + 0.09} = \\frac{0.01}{0.10} = 0.1\n$$\nSo, the drug concentration $D=0.30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ reduces the pAKT activity to $10\\%$ of its baseline level.\n\nNext, we use this value to compute the net proliferation rate $r(D)$:\n$$\nr(D) = (0.050\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}) \\times (0.1)^{1.5}\n$$\nWe evaluate the power term $(0.1)^{1.5}$:\n$$\n(0.1)^{1.5} = (10^{-1})^{3/2} = 10^{-3/2} = 10^{-1} \\times 10^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{10\\sqrt{10}}\n$$\nNumerically, this is approximately $0.0316227766...$\n\nNow, we complete the calculation for $r(D)$:\n$$\nr(D) = 0.050 \\times 0.0316227766... \\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\approx 0.0015811388...\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final result to four significant figures.
