The first four significant figures of the number $0.566666...$ are $5$, $6$, $6$, and $6$. The fifth significant figure is a $6$. Since this digit is $5$ or greater, we must round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$\nR_G \\approx 0.5667\n$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to determine if this computed ratio falls within the target aesthetic range of $0.55$ to $0.60$.

This analysis [@problem_id:4999371] reveals why increasing the thickness of the L-strut is a powerful strategy to prevent postoperative warping and collapse, a key consideration for ensuring a lasting surgical result.", "problem": "In the context of advanced and revision rhinoplasty, the septal L-strut behaves mechanically as a beam whose resistance to bending is governed by flexural rigidity, defined as the product of Young’s modulus $E$ and the second moment of area $I$ about the neutral axis for the direction of bending. Consider a simplified model of the dorsal limb of the L-strut as a homogeneous, isotropic rectangular plate segment of constant width $b$ and variable thickness $t$, with bending occurring in the plane that places the thickness dimension perpendicular to the neutral axis. Assume small deflections and applicability of Euler–Bernoulli beam theory (plane sections remain plane), and assume that $E$ is the same between the two thickness conditions and that $b$ is unchanged.\n\nStarting from the definition of the second moment of area about the neutral axis for bending, $I = \\int y^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}A$, where $y$ is the perpendicular distance from the neutral axis and $\\mathrm{d}A$ is a differential area element of the rectangular cross-section, derive how $I$ scales with $t$ for a rectangle of width $b$ and thickness $t$.

The problem will be solved in three parts as requested: deriving the scaling of the second moment of area $I$ with thickness $t$, computing the ratio $R$ of flexural rigidities, and providing a qualitative interpretation of the result.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the second moment of area, $I$, for a rectangular cross-section of width $b$ and thickness $t$. The problem states that bending occurs in a plane that places the thickness dimension perpendicular to the neutral axis. For a symmetric rectangular cross-section, the neutral axis passes through the centroid. We can set up a coordinate system where the origin $(0,0)$ is at the centroid, the width $b$ is parallel to the z-axis, and the thickness $t$ is along the y-axis. Therefore, the y-coordinates of the rectangle range from $-\\frac{t}{2}$ to $+\\frac{t}{2}$.\n\nThe second moment of area is defined by the integral $I = \\int y^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}A$, where $y$ is the perpendicular distance from the neutral axis (the z-axis in this setup). The differential area element $\\mathrm{d}A$ is an infinitesimally thin horizontal strip of height $\\mathrm{d}y$ and constant width $b$. Thus, $\\mathrm{d}A = b\\,\\mathrm{d}y$.\n\nWe can now evaluate the integral over the entire area of the cross-section by integrating with respect to $y$ from $-\\frac{t}{2}$ to $+\\frac{t}{2}$:\n$$\nI = \\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} y^{2} (b\\,\\mathrm{d}y)\n$$\nSince $b$ is a constant, it can be taken outside the integral:\n$$\nI = b \\int_{-t/2}^{t/2} y^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}y\n$$\nThe antiderivative of $y^2$ is $\\frac{y^3}{3}$. Evaluating the definite integral gives:\n$$\nI = b \\left[ \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right]_{-t/2}^{t/2} = b \\left( \\frac{(t/2)^3}{3} - \\frac{(-t/2)^3}{3} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nI = b \\left( \\frac{t^3/8}{3} - \\frac{-t^3/8}{3} \\right) = b \\left( \\frac{t^3}{24} - \\left(-\\frac{t^3}{24}\\right) \\right) = b \\left( \\frac{t^3}{24} + \\frac{t^3}{24} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nI = b \\left( \\frac{2t^3}{24} \\right) = \\frac{bt^3}{12}\n$$\nThis derivation shows that for a given width $b$, the second moment of area $I$ scales with the cube of the thickness $t$, i.e., $I \\propto t^3$.\n\nNext, we compute the ratio $R$ of the flexural rigidities, $EI$, for two different thicknesses. The flexural rigidity is $EI = E \\frac{bt^3}{12}$. The ratio $R$ is defined as:\n$$\nR \\equiv \\frac{(EI)_{t=3.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}}}{(EI)_{t=1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}}}\n$$\nLet $t_2 = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $t_1 = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The problem states that Young's modulus $E$ and the width $b$ are the same in both cases. Substituting the derived expression for $I$ into the ratio:\n$$\nR = \\frac{E \\cdot \\frac{b t_2^3}{12}}{E \\cdot \\frac{b t_1^3}{12}}\n$$\nThe constants $E$, $b$, and $12$ cancel, simplifying the ratio to:\n$$\nR = \\frac{t_2^3}{t_1^3} = \\left(\\frac{t_2}{t_1}\\right)^3\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\nR = \\left(\\frac{3.0}{1.5}\\right)^3 = (2)^3 = 8\n$$\nThe ratio $R$ is a pure number, $8$. The given width $b=10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is consistent with the model but not required for the calculation of this ratio.\n\nFinally, we briefly explain the qualitative implication of this result for the risk of postoperative warp. Flexural rigidity, $EI$, is a measure of a beam's resistance to bending. A higher $EI$ value indicates a stiffer structure that is less likely to deform under a given bending moment or internal stress. Our calculation shows that $R=8$, meaning that doubling the thickness of the septal L-strut from $1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ to $3.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ increases its resistance to bending by a factor of $8$. Postoperative warp in cartilage grafts is a bending deformity driven by inherent residual stresses. Under identical residual stress conditions, the thicker strut ($t=3.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) is $8$ times more resistant to this deformation than the thinner strut ($t=1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$). Therefore, increasing the thickness of the L-strut is a powerful strategy to significantly reduce the risk of postoperative warp, a critical consideration in revision rhinoplasty where structural stability is paramount.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "4999371"}]}
