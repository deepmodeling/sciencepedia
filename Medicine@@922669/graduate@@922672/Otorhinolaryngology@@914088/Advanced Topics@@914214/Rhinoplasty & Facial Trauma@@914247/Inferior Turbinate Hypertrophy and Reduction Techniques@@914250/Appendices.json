For steady, laminar, incompressible flow, the relationship between pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, and volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is described by Poiseuille's law. From this, the hydraulic resistance, $R$, of a circular tube of length $L$ and radius $r$ is defined as $R = \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q}$, which yields the formula:\n$$R = \\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r^4}$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nThe nasal airway is modeled as a system of resistors. The left and right nasal passages are in parallel. Each passage consists of two resistors in series: the anterior nasal valve segment (subscript $v$) and the inferior meatus segment (subscript $i$).\n\nThe resistance of a single segment is given by $R_{segment} = \\frac{8 \\mu L_{segment}}{\\pi r_{segment}^4}$.
