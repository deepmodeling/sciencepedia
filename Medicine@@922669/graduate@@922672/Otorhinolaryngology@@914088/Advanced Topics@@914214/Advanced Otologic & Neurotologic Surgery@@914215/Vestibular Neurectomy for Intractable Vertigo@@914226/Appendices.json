The secondary task is to interpret this finding in a clinical context.\n\nThe Jongkees formula for canal paresis quantifies the asymmetry between the total vestibular responses of the right and left ears. The total response for each ear is the sum of the maximal Slow Phase Velocity (SPV) values from the warm and cold irrigations.

While specific classifications may vary, a weakness of this magnitude is typically categorized as moderate to severe unilateral peripheral hypofunction. For a patient suffering from intractable vertigo suspected to be of unilateral origin (as in Ménière's disease), identifying a significant, well-lateralized vestibular deficit is a critical prerequisite for considering ablative surgical procedures like vestibular neurectomy. Such a procedure aims to eliminate the dysfunctional vestibular signals from the affected ear.

It is well-posed, objective, complete, and internally consistent. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Construction of the Asymmetry Metric**\n\nWe need to construct a function $A(G_{\\text{contra}}, G_{\\text{ipsi}})$ that satisfies the four given properties. For notational simplicity, let $x = G_{\\text{contra}}$ and $y = G_{\\text{ipsi}}$. VOR gains are non-negative, so $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$.\n\n1.  The simplest mathematical expression that captures asymmetry is the difference, $x-y$. This expression is $0$ when $x=y$ and positive when $x>y$, satisfying properties 1 and 2. However, it is not scale-invariant, since $kx - ky = k(x-y)$, nor is it inherently bounded.\n\n2.  To achieve scale-invariance (property 3), the function must be a function of the ratio $x/y$, or more generally, a ratio of two homogeneous functions of $x$ and $y$ of the same degree. To make the difference $x-y$ scale-invariant, we must normalize it by a quantity that also scales linearly with the gains. The simplest symmetric choice for a normalization denominator is the sum, $x+y$.\n\nLet us propose the following metric, known as the normalized difference or asymmetry index:\n$$A(x, y) = \\frac{x - y}{x + y}$$\nWe must verify if this functional form satisfies all four required properties.\n\n- **Property 1 (Zero for symmetry):** If $x = y$, and assuming $x+y \\neq 0$:\n$$A(x, x) = \\frac{x - x}{x + x} = \\frac{0}{2x} = 0$$\nThis property is satisfied.\n\n- **Property 2 (Sign convention):** If $x > y$, then $x-y > 0$. Since VOR gains are non-negative, $x+y \\ge 0$. We assume not both gains are zero post-surgery, so $x+y > 0$. Thus, $A(x, y) = \\frac{x-y}{x+y} > 0$.\nThis property is satisfied.\n\n- **Property 3 (Scale-invariance):** For any positive scalar $k$:\n$$A(kx, ky) = \\frac{kx-ky}{kx+ky} = \\frac{k(x-y)}{k(x+y)} = \\frac{x-y}{x+y} = A(x,y)$$\nThis property is satisfied.\n\n- **Property 4 (Bounded magnitude):** We must show that $|A(x, y)| \\le 1$.\n$$ |A(x, y)| = \\left| \\frac{x-y}{x+y} \\right| = \\frac{|x-y|}{x+y} $$\nSince $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$, by the triangle inequality, $|x-y| \\le |x| + |y| = x+y$.\nTherefore,\n$$ \\frac{|x-y|}{x+y} \\le \\frac{x+y}{x+y} = 1 $$\nThis shows that $|A(x,y)| \\le 1$. The equality $|A|=1$ occurs if one gain is zero (e.g., if $y=0$, $A = x/x = 1$; if $x=0$, $A = -y/y = -1$).\nThis property is satisfied.\n\nThe constructed metric is:\n$$A(G_{\\text{contra}}, G_{\\text{ipsi}}) = \\frac{G_{\\text{contra}} - G_{\\text{ipsi}}}{G_{\\text{contra}} + G_{\\text{ipsi}}}$$\nThis form is analogous to the Jongkees formula used to calculate canal paresis in caloric testing.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the post-operative VOR gains:\n- Contralateral (unaffected) side: $G_{\\text{contra}} = 0.95$\n- Ipsilateral (operated) side: $G_{\\text{ipsi}} = 0.30$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived metric:\n$$A = \\frac{0.95 - 0.30}{0.95 + 0.30} = \\frac{0.65}{1.25}$$\nTo compute the decimal value:\n$$A = \\frac{65}{125} = \\frac{13 \\times 5}{25 \\times 5} = \\frac{13}{25} = \\frac{52}{100} = 0.52$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$A = 0.5200$$\n\n**Part 3: Clinical Interpretation**\n\nThe calculated asymmetry value is $A = 0.5200$. This indicates a substantial asymmetry between the two vestibular systems. A value of $A=0$ represents perfect symmetry, while a value of $|A|=1$ represents complete loss of function on one side with some function remaining on the other. The value of $0.5200$, which can be expressed as a $52\\%$ asymmetry, is a large deviation from symmetry.\n\nIn the context of vestibular neurectomy for unilateral Ménière disease, the goal of the surgery is to ablate the function of the diseased vestibular nerve (deafferentation). A successful procedure is expected to cause a significant drop in VOR gain on the operated (ipsilateral) side, while the contralateral gain remains normal. The pre-operative gains were symmetric at $0.95$, a normal value. Post-operatively, the contralateral gain remains normal ($0.95$), while the ipsilateral gain has dropped to $0.30$. This pattern is the hallmark of a successful unilateral vestibular ablation.\n\nThe resulting large asymmetry index, $A=0.5200$, quantitatively confirms this clinical picture. It reflects a severe unilateral vestibular hypofunction on the ipsilateral side. In clinical practice, such a marked reduction in ipsilateral gain and the corresponding high asymmetry value are considered evidence of an effective unilateral vestibular deafferentation. Therefore, this magnitude is entirely consistent with the expected outcome of the procedure.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5200}\n$$", "id": "5083387"}, {"introduction": "A successful vestibular neurectomy is followed by a crucial period of central nervous system adaptation, known as vestibular compensation.

A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe problem states that the instantaneous rate of reduction in the excess sway, $S(t)$, is mathematically expressed as $-\\frac{dS}{dt}$. This proportionality can be written as a differential equation:\n$$-\\frac{dS}{dt} = kS(t)$$\nwhere $k$ is a positive constant of proportionality, known as the rate constant. The negative sign indicates that $S(t)$ is a decreasing function of time, as expected for a recovery process. This equation can be rewritten in the standard form for first-order decay:\n$$\\frac{dS}{dt} = -kS(t)$$\nThe problem specifies that the process is characterized by a time constant $\\tau$.

We can solve it by separating variables:\n$$\\frac{dS}{S} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} dt$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to a general time $t$, and from the initial sway $S(0)=S_0$ to the sway $S(t)$:\n$$\\int_{S_0}^{S(t)} \\frac{dS'}{S'} = \\int_0^t -\\frac{1}{\\tau} dt'$$\n$$\\left[ \\ln|S'| \\right]_{S_0}^{S(t)} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} [t']_0^t$$\nSince $S(t)$ represents a physical quantity (sway path length), it is non-negative.
