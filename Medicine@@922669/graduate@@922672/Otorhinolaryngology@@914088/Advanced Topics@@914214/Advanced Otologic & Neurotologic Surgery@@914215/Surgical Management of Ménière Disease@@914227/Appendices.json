It is scientifically grounded in the principles of otolaryngology and audiology, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, clinical language.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts. The first requires a qualitative justification of the characteristic audiometric findings in early-to-mid stage Ménière's disease. The second requires a quantitative calculation of the pure-tone average (PTA) from a given set of hearing thresholds.\n\n**Part 1: Audiometric Profile in Ménière’s Disease**\n\nThe underlying pathophysiology of Ménière's disease is endolymphatic hydrops, which is a distension of the endolymphatic space within the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear. In the cochlea, the auditory portion of the inner ear, this distension is thought to most significantly affect the apical region in the early stages of the disease.\n\nThe cochlea is tonotopically organized. This means that different frequencies of sound are processed at different locations along its length. The base of the cochlea is responsible for processing high-frequency sounds, while the apex is responsible for processing low-frequency sounds.\n\nGiven that endolymphatic hydrops primarily impacts the cochlear apex initially, the first and most prominent functional deficit is a loss of hearing sensitivity for low-frequency sounds. This damage to the sensory hair cells in the apex leads to a hearing loss that is sensorineural in nature. A sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is defined by pathology located in the inner ear (cochlea) or the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII). On an audiogram, this is demonstrated by similarly elevated thresholds for both air conduction and bone conduction, resulting in no significant air-bone gap.\n\nTherefore, the standard description of the audiometric profile in early to mid-stage unilateral Ménière's disease is a **low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss**.\n\nThe configuration of this hearing loss on an audiogram is typically described as \"rising,\" where hearing thresholds are worse (i.e., higher in decibels Hearing Level, or dB HL) at the low frequencies and improve (i.e., become lower in dB HL) towards the higher frequencies. The problem statement posits that speech intelligibility depends predominantly on energy in the low-to-mid frequencies. A low-frequency SNHL preferentially degrades the perception of low-frequency speech components, such as vowel sounds and the fundamental frequencies of voiced consonants. This aligns with the subjective patient complaint of sound being \"muffled\" or \"distorted,\" and difficulty understanding speech, even when the overall volume is adequate. A hallmark of the condition, also mentioned in the problem, is the fluctuation of these low-frequency thresholds, which often worsen during acute vertiginous attacks and may recover partially or fully between episodes in the early stages.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Pure-Tone Average (PTA)**\n\nThe problem provides the following air-conduction hearing thresholds for the affected ear:\n- Threshold at $0.5$ kHz: $H_{0.5} = 40$ dB HL\n- Threshold at $1$ kHz: $H_{1} = 35$ dB HL\n- Threshold at $2$ kHz: $H_{2} = 50$ dB HL\n- Threshold at $3$ kHz: $H_{3} = 45$ dB HL\n\nThe pure-tone average (PTA) is defined as the central tendency (arithmetic mean) of the hearing thresholds over a specified set of frequencies. Although the most traditional PTA is a three-frequency average ($0.5$, $1$, and $2$ kHz), the problem provides four thresholds covering the principal speech frequencies and asks for the PTA to be computed from these data. The most direct and logical interpretation is to calculate the average using all four provided threshold values.\n\nThe formula for the PTA is:\n$$\nPTA = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} H(f_i)\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of frequencies being averaged, and $H(f_i)$ is the hearing threshold at frequency $f_i$.\n\nIn this case, $N=4$, and the frequencies are $0.5$ kHz, $1$ kHz, $2$ kHz, and $3$ kHz. We can substitute the given values into the formula:\n$$\nPTA = \\frac{H_{0.5} + H_{1} + H_{2} + H_{3}}{4}\n$$\n$$\nPTA = \\frac{40 + 35 + 50 + 45}{4}\n$$\nFirst, we sum the thresholds:\n$$\n\\sum H = 40 + 35 + 50 + 45 = 170\n$$\nNext, we divide the sum by the number of frequencies, $N=4$:\n$$\nPTA = \\frac{170}{4} = 42.5\n$$\nThe value is given in units of decibels Hearing Level (dB HL). The problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. The calculated value of $42.5$ already has three significant figures ($4$, $2$, and $5$). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.\nThe computed pure-tone average is $42.5$ dB HL.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{42.5}$$", "id": "5076296"}, {"introduction": "The decision between a function-preserving surgery and an ablative one hinges critically on the functional status of the vestibular system. By quantifying the degree of vestibular weakness in the affected ear, we can justify the choice of a destructive procedure like labyrinthectomy. This problem illustrates how to derive and interpret a caloric asymmetry index from first principles, a key piece of data in surgical planning for intractable vertigo [@problem_id:5076404].", "problem": "A patient with definitive unilateral Menière’s disease presents with disabling episodic vertigo refractory to medical therapy. As part of vestibular function testing, bithermal irrigations are deferred; instead, identical warm irrigations are delivered to each ear, and horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) slow-phase velocity (SPV) is measured using video-oculography.

Express the caloric asymmetry as a decimal fraction (no percentage sign), and round your numerical answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It describes a realistic clinical scenario in otorhinolaryngology, providing sufficient and consistent data to construct a relevant metric, compute its value, and perform the requested clinical reasoning. The problem is valid for solution.\n\nThe task is to construct a dimensionless scalar from first principles to quantify the asymmetry between the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) responses of the two ears, and then to interpret this value in the context of surgical decision-making for Menière's disease.\n\nFirst, we establish the principle for constructing such a scalar. When comparing two measured positive quantities, say $q_1$ and $q_2$, a standard method to define a dimensionless asymmetry index is to take the ratio of their difference to their sum. This normalization creates a scalar value that is independent of the absolute magnitudes of the quantities and is bounded between $0$ (for perfect symmetry) and $1$ (for complete asymmetry, where one value is zero). The magnitude of the asymmetry is given by the absolute value of this ratio.\n\nLet $v_R$ and $v_L$ be the slow-phase velocities (SPVs) measured for the right and left ears, respectively, under identical warm caloric stimulation. Based on the first principle described above, we define the caloric asymmetry index, denoted as $A_C$, as:\n$$A_C = \\frac{|v_L - v_R|}{v_L + v_R}$$\nThis formula yields a dimensionless scalar quantity representing the fractional asymmetry of the responses. It is analogous in form and purpose to the Unilateral Weakness (or Canal Paresis) formula widely used in clinical neurotology, which is calculated from the full bithermal caloric test battery. A positive value for the expression inside the absolute value, $(v_L - v_R)$, would indicate a relative weakness in the right ear, and a negative value would indicate a relative weakness in the left ear. The problem asks for a scalar that quantifies the magnitude of the asymmetry, for which the absolute value is appropriate.\n\nNext, we compute the value of this scalar using the given data. The problem states that the measured SPVs are:\n$v_R = 12$ $\\mathrm{deg/s}$\n$v_L = 24$ $\\mathrm{deg/s}$\n\nSubstituting these values into our constructed formula for $A_C$:\n$$A_C = \\frac{|24 \\, \\mathrm{deg/s} - 12 \\, \\mathrm{deg/s}|}{24 \\, \\mathrm{deg/s} + 12 \\, \\mathrm{deg/s}} = \\frac{12 \\, \\mathrm{deg/s}}{36 \\, \\mathrm{deg/s}}$$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{deg/s}$ cancel, confirming that the scalar is dimensionless.\n$$A_C = \\frac{12}{36} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nExpressing this as a decimal fraction, we get:\n$$A_C = 0.333333...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$A_C \\approx 0.3333$$\n\nFinally, we must reason whether this magnitude of asymmetry is consistent with the level of unilateral vestibular hypofunction that supports consideration of ablative surgery. The calculated asymmetry $A_C \\approx 0.3333$ is equivalent to a $33.33\\%$ unilateral weakness. In clinical practice, a unilateral weakness exceeding a threshold, typically in the range of $20\\%$ to $25\\%$, is considered a significant peripheral vestibular deficit.\n\nThe patient has disabling vertigo refractory to medical therapy, making surgical intervention a valid consideration. The main surgical options mentioned are endolymphatic sac surgery (a hearing- and function-preserving procedure) and labyrinthectomy (an ablative procedure).\n- **Endolymphatic sac surgery** is typically considered for patients who have serviceable hearing and less severe vestibular dysfunction. Its goal is to control vertigo while preserving the existing auditory and vestibular function.\n- **Labyrinthectomy** involves the surgical destruction of the vestibular end organ. It offers a very high rate of vertigo control but at the cost of sacrificing all residual hearing and vestibular function in the operated ear. This procedure is therefore reserved for patients with disabling vertigo who have poor or non-serviceable hearing in the affected ear, and in whom a significant vestibular deficit has been documented.\n\nThe calculated asymmetry of $33.33\\%$ clearly indicates a significant unilateral vestibular hypofunction in the right ear (since $v_R  v_L$). This level of dysfunction is substantial and well above the typical threshold for clinical significance. Such a finding demonstrates that the right labyrinth is already severely compromised. In a patient with disabling vertigo and poor hearing in the affected ear, demonstrating a significant pre-existing vestibular loss strengthens the rationale for an ablative procedure. The reasoning is that the dysfunctional labyrinth is the source of the vertigo, and its removal (labyrinthectomy) provides definitive treatment by eliminating the pathological signals, with the \"loss\" of function being more acceptable as that function is already significantly impaired. Therefore, an asymmetry of $33.33\\%$ is indeed consistent with a degree of vestibular pathology for which an ablative procedure like labyrinthectomy would be a primary consideration, contingent on the hearing status of the affected ear.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.3333}\n$$", "id": "5076404"}, {"introduction": "Choosing the optimal surgery requires a robust understanding of the evidence comparing different procedures.

The procedures and outcome are standard in the management of Ménière's disease. The provided probabilities, $p_1=0.70$ and $p_2=0.05$, are medically plausible, as labyrinthectomy is an ablative procedure designed to destroy vestibular function, which inherently sacrifices hearing, while ESS is a hearing-sparing procedure. The definitions for odds and odds ratio are standard and correct. The problem is self-contained, well-posed, and objective. It contains no scientific or factual unsoundness, no contradictions, and no ambiguities.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation of the odds ratio (OR) for hearing preservation, comparing endolymphatic sac surgery (ESS) to labyrinthectomy. Let $p_1$ be the probability (proportion) of hearing preservation in the ESS group and $p_2$ be the probability of hearing preservation in the labyrinthectomy group.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n$$ p_1 = 0.70 $$\n$$ p_2 = 0.05 $$\n\nThe odds of an event are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring. The odds of hearing preservation for the ESS group, denoted $\\text{Odds}_1$, are:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_1 = \\frac{p_1}{1 - p_1} $$\nSubstituting the value of $p_1$:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_1 = \\frac{0.70}{1 - 0.70} = \\frac{0.70}{0.30} $$\nTo work with exact fractions, we represent the decimals as fractions: $0.70 = \\frac{7}{10}$ and $0.30 = \\frac{3}{10}$.\n$$ \\text{Odds}_1 = \\frac{7/10}{3/10} = \\frac{7}{3} $$\n\nSimilarly, the odds of hearing preservation for the labyrinthectomy group, denoted $\\text{Odds}_2$, are:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_2 = \\frac{p_2}{1 - p_2} $$\nSubstituting the value of $p_2$:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_2 = \\frac{0.05}{1 - 0.05} = \\frac{0.05}{0.95} $$\nAgain, converting to fractions: $0.05 = \\frac{5}{100} = \\frac{1}{20}$ and $0.95 = \\frac{95}{100} = \\frac{19}{20}$.\n$$ \\text{Odds}_2 = \\frac{1/20}{19/20} = \\frac{1}{19} $$\n\nThe odds ratio (OR) is the ratio of the odds in the exposed group (ESS) to the odds in the comparison group (labyrinthectomy).\n$$ \\text{OR} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_1}{\\text{Odds}_2} $$\nSubstituting the calculated odds for each group:\n$$ \\text{OR} = \\frac{7/3}{1/19} = \\frac{7}{3} \\times \\frac{19}{1} = \\frac{133}{3} $$\nThis fraction is in its simplest form, as $133 = 7 \\times 19$ and $3$ is a prime number that is not a factor of $133$.\n\n### Interpretation\nThe numerical value of the odds ratio is $\\frac{133}{3}$, which is approximately $44.33$. This means that the odds of hearing preservation for a patient undergoing endolymphatic sac surgery are over $44$ times the odds of hearing preservation for a patient undergoing labyrinthectomy. This indicates a very strong association between the choice of surgery and the odds of preserving hearing.\n\n### Caution on Interpretation\nThe problem explicitly requests a note of caution regarding the interpretation of odds ratios when event probabilities are not rare. The odds ratio (OR) and the risk ratio (RR, or relative risk) are two different measures of association. The RR is the ratio of probabilities: $\\text{RR} = \\frac{p_1}{p_2}$. In this case, $\\text{RR} = \\frac{0.70}{0.05} = 14$.\n\nThe OR provides a good approximation of the RR only when the outcome is rare in the population, typically when $p  0.10$. In this problem, the probability of hearing preservation in the ESS group is $p_1 = 0.70$, which is a common event, not a rare one. When the outcome is common, the OR will always be further from $1.0$ than the RR, thus exaggerating the strength of the association. Here, the OR is $\\frac{133}{3} \\approx 44.33$, which is substantially larger than the RR of $14$. It is therefore incorrect to interpret the OR of $\\approx 44.33$ as \"patients are $44.33$ times *as likely* to preserve hearing.\" The correct, direct interpretation is that the *odds* are $44.33$ times higher, whereas the *risk* (or probability) is only $14$ times higher. This divergence between the OR and RR is a critical consideration when communicating results to avoid misinterpretation of the effect size.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{133}{3}}\n$$", "id": "5076393"}]}
