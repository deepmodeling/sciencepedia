We can proceed with a solution based on first principles.\n\nThe task is to determine the maximum allowable constant current amplitude ($I$) for a single phase of a biphasic pulse delivered by a disc-shaped electrode, given constraints on the per-phase charge density. This derivation relies on three core definitions: the area of a circle, the definition of surface charge density, and the definition of constant electrical current.\n\n1.  **Geometric Surface Area of the Electrode**\n    The stimulating contact is described as an ideal flat disk with a geometric diameter $d = 1.2\\,\\text{mm}$. The surface area $A$ of a circle is given by the formula:\n    $$A = \\pi r^2$$\n    where $r$ is the radius. Since the radius is half the diameter ($r = d/2$), we can express the area in terms of the diameter:\n    $$A = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}$$\n\n2.  **Maximum Charge per Phase**\n    Surface charge density, $\\sigma$, is defined as the total charge $Q$ distributed over a surface area $A$:\n    $$\\sigma = \\frac{Q}{A}$$\n    The problem states a safety limit for the per-phase charge density, $\\sigma_{max} = 40\\,\\mu\\text{C}/\\text{cm}^{2}$. This constraint determines the maximum charge, $Q_{max}$, that can be safely delivered during a single pulse phase.\n    $$Q_{max} = \\sigma_{max} \\times A$$\n\n3.  **Maximum Current Amplitude**\n    For a constant (DC) current, the electrical current $I$ is defined as the amount of charge $Q$ that flows per unit time $t$:\n    $$I = \\frac{Q}{t}$$\n    The problem specifies a constant current amplitude during a phase of duration $t = 200\\,\\mu\\text{s}$. To satisfy the safety limit, the current amplitude $I$ must not exceed a maximum value, $I_{max}$, corresponding to the delivery of the maximum safe charge $Q_{max}$ over the phase duration $t$:\n    $$I_{max} = \\frac{Q_{max}}{t}$$\n\nBy substituting the expressions for $A$ and $Q_{max}$ into the equation for $I_{max}$, we can derive a single expression for the maximum allowable current in terms of the given parameters:\n$$I_{max} = \\frac{\\sigma_{max} \\times A}{t} = \\frac{\\sigma_{max} \\left(\\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}\\right)}{t} = \\frac{\\pi \\sigma_{max} d^2}{4t}$$\n\nNow, we perform the calculation using the provided values. It is essential to maintain consistent units throughout. The charge density is given in units involving square centimeters ($\\text{cm}^2$), so we must convert the electrode diameter from millimeters ($\\text{mm}$) to centimeters ($\\text{cm}$).\n\nThe given diameter is $d = 1.2\\,\\text{mm}$. Using the conversion factor $1\\,\\text{cm} = 10\\,\\text{mm}$:\n$$d = 1.2\\,\\text{mm} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\text{cm}}{10\\,\\text{mm}} = 0.12\\,\\text{cm}$$\n\nThe other given values are:\n$$\\sigma_{max} = 40\\,\\frac{\\mu\\text{C}}{\\text{cm}^2}$$\n$$t = 200\\,\\mu\\text{s}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the area $A$ of the electrode:\n$$A = \\frac{\\pi (0.12\\,\\text{cm})^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi (0.0144\\,\\text{cm}^2)}{4} = 0.0036\\pi\\,\\text{cm}^2$$\n\nNext, we calculate the maximum charge per phase, $Q_{max}$:\n$$Q_{max} = \\sigma_{max} \\times A = 40\\,\\frac{\\mu\\text{C}}{\\text{cm}^2} \\times 0.0036\\pi\\,\\text{cm}^2 = 0.144\\pi\\,\\mu\\text{C}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the maximum current, $I_{max}$. A crucial point in the unit analysis is that dividing a charge in microcoulombs ($\\mu\\text{C}$) by a time in microseconds ($\\mu\\text{s}$) results in a current in Amperes ($\\text{A}$), because the prefix $\\mu = 10^{-6}$ cancels out:\n$$I_{max} = \\frac{Q_{max}}{t} = \\frac{0.144\\pi\\,\\mu\\text{C}}{200\\,\\mu\\text{s}} = \\frac{0.144\\pi \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{C}}{200 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}} = \\frac{0.144\\pi}{200}\\,\\text{A} = 0.00072\\pi\\,\\text{A}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer in milliamperes ($\\text{mA}$). We apply the conversion $1\\,\\text{A} = 1000\\,\\text{mA}$:\n$$I_{max} = 0.00072\\pi\\,\\text{A} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\text{mA}}{1\\,\\text{A}} = 0.72\\pi\\,\\text{mA}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round it to three significant figures as requested:\n$$I_{max} \\approx 0.72 \\times 3.14159265... \\,\\text{mA} \\approx 2.2619467...\\,\\text{mA}$$\nRounding to three significant figures yields:\n$$I_{max} \\approx 2.26\\,\\text{mA}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.26}$$", "id": "5007083"}, {"introduction": "A critical moment in ABI surgery is confirming the implant's function by eliciting an Electrically Evoked Auditory Brainstem Response (EABR).

To validate its internal consistency, we must first determine why no EABR is observed with the initial parameters.\n\nThe relationship between the threshold current ($I_{\\mathrm{th}}$) required to excite a neuron and the stimulus pulse width ($w$) is described by the Lapicque-Weiss strength-duration formula:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{th}}(w) = I_r \\left(1 + \\frac{t_c}{w}\\right)$$\nUsing the provided physiological parameters ($I_r = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mA}$, $t_c = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$) and the initial pulse width ($w = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$), we can calculate the threshold current:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{th}}(50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}) = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mA} \\left(1 + \\frac{100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}}{50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}}\\right) = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mA} \\times (1 + 2) = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mA}$$\nThe applied current is $I = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{mA}$. Since $I < I_{\\mathrm{th}}$, the stimulus is subthreshold, which consistently explains the absence of an EABR.\n\nNext, we must check if the initial parameters respect the device and safety limits.\n1.  **Voltage Compliance:** The voltage required is given by Ohm's Law, $V = I \\times Z$.\n    $$V = (0.8\\,\\mathrm{mA}) \\times (4\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega) = (0.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}) \\times (4 \\times 10^3\\,\\Omega) = 3.2\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n    Since $3.2\\,\\mathrm{V} < V_{\\mathrm{comp}} = 8\\,\\mathrm{V}$, the stimulator is operating within its compliance voltage.\n2.  **Charge Density Safety:** The charge per phase is $Q = I \\times w$, and the charge density is $D = Q/A$.\n    $$Q = (0.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}) \\times (50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 40 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{C} = 40\\,\\mathrm{nC}$$\n    $$D = \\frac{40\\,\\mathrm{nC}}{0.01\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2} = \\frac{40 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{C}}{0.01\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2} = 4 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{C}/\\mathrm{cm}^2 = 4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{C}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$$\n    Since $4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{C}/\\mathrm{cm}^2 < D_{\\max} = 30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{C}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$, the stimulus is within the safe charge density limit.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, self-consistent, and well-posed. The observation of no response is explained by a subthreshold stimulus, and the initial parameters are within all stated constraints. We can proceed to solve the problem.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary goal is to modify the stimulation parameters to make the stimulus suprathreshold ($I > I_{\\mathrm{th}}$) while adhering to all device and safety constraints. We will now evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Move from $C_5$ to adjacent contact $C_4$ with lower impedance $Z = 2\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega$, switch to cathodic-first biphasic pulses, increase per-phase pulse width to $w = 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$ while maintaining $I = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{mA}$, reduce stimulation rate to $10\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, and use alternating polarity averaging.**\n\n1.  **Neurophysiological Soundness**:\n    -   *Move to $C_4$ ($Z = 2\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega$)*: A lower impedance contact is often preferable, as it reduces the voltage required to deliver a given current and may indicate less current shunting by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\n    -   *Switch to cathodic-first*: For extracellular stimulation of myelinated axons, cathodic (negative) pulses are more efficient at causing depolarization than anodic (positive) pulses. This is a standard and effective change to lower the effective stimulation threshold.\n    -   *Increase pulse width to $w = 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$*: Let's calculate the new threshold current:\n        $$I_{\\mathrm{th}}(200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}) = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mA} \\left(1 + \\frac{100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}}{200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}}\\right) = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mA} \\times (1 + 0.5) = 0.75\\,\\mathrm{mA}$$\n        The applied current is $I = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{mA}$. Since $I > I_{\\mathrm{th}}$ ($0.8\\,\\mathrm{mA} > 0.75\\,\\mathrm{mA}$), the stimulus is now suprathreshold and should elicit a response.\n    -   *Reduce rate to $10\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ and use alternating polarity averaging*: These are standard best practices for robustly recording evoked potentials while minimizing neural adaptation and stimulus artifact.\n\n2.  **Constraint Validation**:\n    -   *Voltage Compliance*: With $Z = 2\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega$ and $I = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{mA}$:\n        $$V = (0.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}) \\times (2 \\times 10^3\\,\\Omega) = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n        This is well below $V_{\\mathrm{comp}} = 8\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n    -   *Charge Density Safety*: With $I = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ and $w = 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$:\n        $$Q = (0.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}) \\times (200 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 160\\,\\mathrm{nC}$$\n        $$D = \\frac{160\\,\\mathrm{nC}}{0.01\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2} = 16\\,\\mu\\mathrm{C}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$$\n        This is below $D_{\\max} = 30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{C}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.** This option describes a systematic, safe, and effective troubleshooting sequence that is highly likely to elicit an EABR. Every step is justified by first principles.\n\n**B. Keep contact $C_5$ ($Z = 4\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega$), maintain anodic-first polarity, increase current to $I = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ at $w = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$, and increase stimulation rate to $60\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.**\n\n1.  **Neurophysiological Soundness**:\n    -   The threshold at $w = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$ is $I_{\\mathrm{th}} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mA}$. Increasing the current to $I = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ would make the stimulus strongly suprathreshold. However, we must check if this is possible.\n\n2.  **Constraint Validation**:\n    -   *Voltage Compliance*: With $Z = 4\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega$ and $I = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{mA}$:\n        $$V = (3.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}) \\times (4 \\times 10^3\\,\\Omega) = 14\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n        This required voltage of $14\\,\\mathrm{V}$ **exceeds** the device's compliance voltage of $V_{\\mathrm{comp}} = 8\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The stimulator cannot deliver the requested $3.5\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ current into a $4\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega$ load. The actual current would be limited (clipped) to $I_{\\mathrm{actual}} = V_{\\mathrm{comp}} / Z = 8\\,\\mathrm{V} / 4\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega = 2\\,\\mathrm{mA}$. While this clipped current is still suprathreshold ($2\\,\\mathrm{mA} > 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mA}$), the parameter setting itself is invalid as it commands the device to operate outside its specifications.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** The proposed parameters violate the device's compliance voltage limit, making the action unachievable as specified.\n\n**C. Switch to anodic-first pulses explicitly, reduce pulse width further to $w = 25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$ while keeping $I = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{mA}$, retain contact $C_5$ ($Z = 4\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega$), and maintain stimulation rate at $30\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.**\n\n1.  **Neurophysiological Soundness**:\n    -   *Switch to anodic-first*: The stimulus is already anodic-first, so this is a redundant statement.\n    -   *Reduce pulse width to $w = 25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$*: Let's calculate the new threshold current:\n        $$I_{\\mathrm{th}}(25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}) = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mA} \\left(1 + \\frac{100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}}{25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}}\\right) = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mA} \\times (1 + 4) = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mA}$$\n        The applied current is still $I = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{mA}$. This action increases the threshold from $1.5\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ to $2.5\\,\\mathrm{mA}$, making the stimulus even more subthreshold. This strategy moves in the wrong direction and is fundamentally flawed.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** This option demonstrates a misunderstanding of the strength-duration relationship and would make eliciting a response less likely, not more.\n\n**D. Stimulate simultaneously on three adjacent contacts at $I = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ per contact, $w = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$, anodic-first polarity, and $30\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, to “sum” fields and increase the likelihood of neural recruitment without changing other parameters.**\n\n1.  **Neurophysiological Soundness**:\n    -   The idea of field summation is valid but complex. It is not a simple arithmetic addition of currents at the target neuron. The total injected current is $3 \\times 0.4\\,\\mathrm{mA} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{mA}$.\n    -   The threshold for a single stimulus point at $w=50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$ is $I_{\\mathrm{th}} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mA}$. Since the total current ($1.2\\,\\mathrm{mA}$) is less than the calculated point-source threshold ($1.5\\,\\mathrm{mA}$), it is highly uncertain whether this strategy would be successful. It is a much less direct and less certain method than simply ensuring the stimulus is suprathreshold on a single channel, as in Option A.\n\n2.  **Constraint Validation**:\n    -   The parameters are within voltage and safety limits for each individual electrode. For a single contact: $V = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{mA} \\times 4\\,\\mathrm{k}\\Omega = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{V}$ (compliant); $D = (0.4\\,\\mathrm{mA} \\times 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}) / 0.01\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2 = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{C}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$ (safe).\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** While not violating any hard constraints, this is a speculative strategy with a low probability of success compared to Option A. It does not guarantee a suprathreshold stimulus and is not the \"best\" or \"most likely\" path to success. The most robust troubleshooting path involves direct, verifiable changes that are known to increase stimulus efficacy, which this option does not provide.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption A is the only one that proposes a comprehensive, safe, and neurophysiologically sound sequence of actions that verifiably transforms the subthreshold stimulus into a suprathreshold one, while also employing best practices for electrode selection and signal recording.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5007181"}, {"introduction": "The long-term success of an ABI depends on meticulous postoperative programming, where the goal is to create a map that provides the richest possible sound without inducing non-auditory side effects.

The terminology ($T$, $C$, $S$, dynamic range, EABR) and the clinical challenges (nonauditory side effects, vagal activation) are standard and factually correct for ABI programming.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides a clear dataset (the electrode groups) and a set of explicit rules (the fundamental principles) to be applied. The question asks for the \"most defensible\" option, which implies a reasoned judgment based on the provided framework. A unique best answer can be determined.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, technical language. The principles provided serve as the axioms for solving the problem, removing subjectivity.\n-   **Consistency and Completeness**: The electrode counts sum correctly ($4+3+3+2 = 12$). The conditions for each group are mutually exclusive and the principles form a coherent, non-contradictory set of guidelines for making clinical decisions.\n-   **Realism**: The scenario is highly realistic, reflecting common challenges and outcomes in ABI centers.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is declared **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe core of the problem is to devise a channel deactivation strategy that maximizes safety and potential for speech understanding, based on the provided principles. This requires analyzing each electrode group to determine its utility and safety.\n\n**Analysis of Electrode Groups based on Principles:**\n\n1.  **Group A ($4$ electrodes)**: Have the condition $S < T$. The nonauditory sensation ($S$) occurs at a current level below the auditory threshold ($T$). The usable auditory window is $W = \\min(C, S) - T = S - T$, which is negative. There is no current range that can elicit an auditory percept without also causing a nonauditory sensation. According to Principle 8, these channels are unusable and should be deactivated. This is consistent with the lack of confirmed behavioral detection.\n    -   **Decision**: Deactivate all $4$ electrodes.\n\n2.  **Group B ($3$ electrodes)**:\n    -   One electrode evokes bradycardia and hypotension. Principle 6 is unequivocal: \"consistent autonomic signs... are a strict indication to avoid such stimulation\". This electrode is unsafe and must be deactivated.\n    -   The other two electrodes have $T < S < C$ and $S - T \\approx 0.10\\,(C - T)$. We calculate the normalized usable fraction $w$:\n        $$w = \\frac{W}{DR} = \\frac{\\min(C, S) - T}{C - T} = \\frac{S - T}{C - T} \\approx 0.10$$\n        A value of $w \\approx 0.10$ means that only $10\\%$ of the potential dynamic range is available before nonauditory side effects occur. Principle 4 states that channels require a \"nontrivial $w$\" and that channels with \"very small $w$\" are problematic. A $10\\%$ usable window is very small and would severely limit the ability to code loudness information. According to Principles 4 and 8, these channels are of very poor quality and are strong candidates for deactivation.\n    -   **Decision**: Deactivate the unsafe electrode. The other two are of extremely low quality and should also be deactivated to optimize overall performance. So, deactivate all $3$ electrodes in this group.\n\n3.  **Group C ($3$ electrodes)**: Have $T < S < C$ and $S - T \\approx 0.60\\,(C - T)$. The normalized usable fraction is:\n    $$w = \\frac{S - T}{C - T} \\approx 0.60$$\n    A value of $w \\approx 0.60$ represents a substantial usable auditory window. These channels can effectively code loudness over a significant range before any side effects are induced. Although one has an absent EABR, behavioral detection is present for all, confirming their status as auditory channels. The principles do not mandate deactivation for absent EABR if a behavioral percept exists.\n    -   **Decision**: Retain all $3$ electrodes. Their maximum stimulation level should be capped at or below $S$ to ensure comfort.\n\n4.  **Group D ($2$ electrodes)**: Have no nonauditory sensations up to $C$, meaning $S \\ge C$. The usable auditory window is $W = \\min(C, S) - T = C - T$. The normalized usable fraction is:\n    $$w = \\frac{W}{DR} = \\frac{C - T}{C - T} = 1.0$$\n    A value of $w=1.0$ indicates that the full dynamic range is usable without any nonauditory side effects. These are ideal channels.\n    -   **Decision**: Retain all $2$ electrodes.\n\n**Summary of Optimal Strategy**:\n-   Deactivate: Group A ($4$ channels), Group B ($3$ channels). Total deactivated: $7$.\n-   Retain: Group C ($3$ channels), Group D ($2$ channels). Total retained: $5$.\nThe resulting map would be built on $5$ high-quality, safe channels, which is expected to provide better overall performance than a map that includes problematic channels, consistent with Principle 8.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Deactivate only electrodes with $S < T$ and the electrode that produced bradycardia; retain all others and cap each at its $S$. Predict minimal loss of spectral coverage and improved comfort with little change in overall performance.**\nThis option deactivates Group A ($4$) and one from Group B ($1$), for a total of $5$ deactivated channels. It retains $7$ channels, including the two from Group B with $w \\approx 0.10$. Retaining these very poor quality channels violates the spirit of Principles 4 and 8. Such channels can constrain global loudness and may not contribute effectively. The prediction of \"minimal loss\" is an overstatement for deactivating $5/12$ channels, and \"little change in overall performance\" is optimistic given the retention of poor channels.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Deactivate any electrode that ever produces a nonauditory sensation (i.e., all with finite $S$), keeping only channels with no nonauditory sensations up to $C$. Predict improved speech performance due to removal of interfering channels despite a large reduction in channel count.**\nThis strategy deactivates Groups A, B, and C, as they all have a finite $S$. Only Group D ($2$ electrodes) would remain. While this prioritizes avoiding all side effects, reducing the map to only $2$ channels would severely compromise spectral resolution. Principle 7 notes that performance generally increases with the number of *usable* channels. The channels in Group C are very usable ($w \\approx 0.60$). Discarding them would almost certainly lead to a degradation, not an improvement, in speech performance.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Deactivate electrodes where nonauditory sensations occur at or below auditory threshold ($S \\le T$), any electrode eliciting autonomic signs, and electrodes with an extremely narrow usable auditory window, defined by $w < 0.20$; do not deactivate an electrode solely for absent EABR if behavioral detection is present. For remaining channels with $0.20 \\le w \\le 1.0$, cap levels at $S$ where applicable. Predict a moderate reduction in spectral coverage owing to fewer active channels, but a net improvement in overall performance because the retained channels provide adequate dynamic range without off-target activation.**\nThis option provides a set of criteria that perfectly aligns with our analysis based on the fundamental principles:\n-   Deactivates $S \\le T$ (Group A).\n-   Deactivates autonomic signs (the one electrode in Group B).\n-   Deactivates for extremely narrow window $w < 0.20$. For Group B, $w \\approx 0.10$, so the other two are deactivated. For Group C ($w \\approx 0.60$) and D ($w = 1.0$), the channels are retained as $w \\ge 0.20$.\n-   The EABR and capping rules are correctly stated and applied.\nThis results in retaining $5$ high-quality channels (Groups C and D). The prediction of a moderate reduction in channel count but a net improvement in performance is the most logical outcome, embodying the \"quality over quantity\" approach that is central to the provided principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Retain all electrodes but reduce the global stimulation level so that no channel exceeds the lowest $S$ observed among all electrodes. Predict the best performance because more channels always increase spectral coverage, even if globally quieter.**\nThis strategy is fundamentally flawed. The lowest $S$ values are in Group A, where $S < T$. Setting a global maximum current at such a low level could render the entire implant inaudible. It also explicitly retains the unsafe electrode from Group B, violating Principle 6. The premise that \"more channels always increase spectral coverage\" is a misinterpretation of Principle 7, which specifies *usable* channels. This strategy retains unusable and unsafe channels and would likely result in zero or very poor performance.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "5007183"}]}
