It is scientifically grounded in the principles of neurostimulation and electrochemistry, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data for the requested calculations under idealized assumptions, and is expressed in objective, technical language.\n\nThe problem asks for two components: a definition and a calculation.\n\nFirst, we define \"charge-balanced biphasic stimulation\" in the specified context. When an electrode is used to deliver electrical current to biological tissue, which functions as an electrolyte, there is a risk of inducing irreversible electrochemical reactions at the electrode-tissue interface. Such reactions, including water electrolysis (which alters local pH) and electrode material corrosion, can cause significant damage to both the electrode and the surrounding neural tissue. These deleterious effects are primarily caused by a net flow of direct current (DC) or a non-zero DC component in the stimulation waveform. To prevent this, neurostimulation protocols almost universally employ biphasic current pulses. A biphasic pulse consists of two phases of opposite polarity: a cathodic (negative) phase and an anodic (positive) phase.\n\nA biphasic stimulation waveform is defined as \"charge-balanced\" if the net electrical charge delivered to the tissue over one complete pulse cycle is zero. Electrical charge, $Q$, is the time integral of the electrical current, $I(t)$. Mathematically, for a single pulse cycle starting at time $t_0$ and ending at time $t_f$, the condition for charge balance is:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{net}} = \\int_{t_0}^{t_f} I(t) \\,dt = 0$$\nBy ensuring $Q_{\\mathrm{net}} = 0$, no net DC is transferred to the tissue over time, which minimizes the risk of electrochemical damage and ensures the long-term safety and stability of the neural implant.\n\nSecond, we compute the net injected charge per pulse, $Q_{\\mathrm{net}}$, for the given waveform. The problem provides idealized conditions of perfectly rectangular current pulses. For a rectangular pulse of constant current amplitude $I$ and duration $T$, the injected charge $Q$ is simply the product $Q = I \\times T$.\n\nThe total pulse is comprised of three segments:\n1.  A cathodic phase with amplitude $I_c$ and duration $T_c$.\n2.  An interphase gap with current $I_{gap}$ and duration $T_{gap}$.\n3.  An anodic phase with amplitude $I_a$ and duration $T_a$.\n\nBy convention, cathodic current (current flowing out of the electrode) is assigned a negative sign, and anodic current (current flowing into the electrode) is assigned a positive sign. The given values are:\n-   Cathodic phase: $I_c = -200\\ \\mu\\mathrm{A}$, $T_c = 100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$\n-   Anodic phase: $I_a = +200\\ \\mu\\mathrm{A}$, $T_a = 100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$\n-   Interphase gap: $I_{gap} = 0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{A}$, $T_{gap} = 50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$\n\nThe net charge per pulse, $Q_{\\mathrm{net}}$, is the algebraic sum of the charge injected during each segment:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{net}} = Q_c + Q_{gap} + Q_a$$\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{net}} = (I_c \\times T_c) + (I_{gap} \\times T_{gap}) + (I_a \\times T_a)$$\n\nWe now calculate the charge for each phase, converting units to base SI units (Amperes, seconds, Coulombs) for consistency.\n$1\\ \\mu\\mathrm{A} = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{A}$\n$1\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s} = 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n\nCharge of the cathodic phase, $Q_c$:\n$$Q_c = (-200 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{A}) \\times (100 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s}) = -20000 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{C} = -20 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{C}$$\n\nCharge during the interphase gap, $Q_{gap}$:\n$$Q_{gap} = (0\\ \\mathrm{A}) \\times (50 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s}) = 0\\ \\mathrm{C}$$\n\nCharge of the anodic phase, $Q_a$:\n$$Q_a = (+200 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{A}) \\times (100 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s}) = +20000 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{C} = +20 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{C}$$\n\nThe net charge per pulse is the sum:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{net}} = Q_c + Q_{gap} + Q_a = (-20 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{C}) + (0\\ \\mathrm{C}) + (+20 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{C}) = 0\\ \\mathrm{C}$$\n\nThe problem requests the answer in nanoCoulombs (nC), where $1\\ \\mathrm{nC} = 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{C}$.\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{net}} = 0\\ \\mathrm{nC}$$\nThe result is exactly zero, so no rounding is necessary.

It presents a standard bioengineering problem involving the linearization of a system's response curve, which is a fundamental technique in control theory and neural engineering. All provided data are consistent and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem states that the relationship between the afferent firing rate, $r$, and the stimulus pulse rate, $f$, is given by a function $r(f)$. Near a specific operating point $f_0$, this function is approximated by its first-order Taylor expansion, resulting in a local affine model:\n$$r(f) \\approx r(f_0) + r'(f_0) (f - f_0)$$\nwhere $r'(f_0)$ is the derivative of $r$ with respect to $f$ evaluated at $f_0$.\n\nThe problem provides this linear approximation in the form:\n$$r \\approx a f + b$$\nBy comparing the two forms, we can identify the parameters. The slope $a$ corresponds to the derivative at the operating point:\n$$a = r'(f_0)$$\nSubstituting this into the Taylor expansion gives:\n$$r(f) \\approx r(f_0) + a (f - f_0)$$\nRearranging this into the form $af+b$ yields:\n$$r(f) \\approx a f + (r(f_0) - a f_0)$$\nThis implies that the intercept $b$ is a constant term that ensures the approximation is correct at the operating point $f_0$:\n$$b = r(f_0) - a f_0$$\nThis confirms that at $f = f_0$, the model gives $r(f_0) = a f_0 + b$, which is consistent. The provided value of $b = 10$ is specific to the chosen operating point $f_0$ but is not needed to find the relationship between changes in $r$ and $f$.\n\nWe are asked to find the relationship between a small change in pulse rate, $\\Delta f$, and the resulting small change in firing rate, $\\Delta r$. Let us consider two points in the linear regime, $(f_1, r_1)$ and $(f_2, r_2)$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of vestibular physiology and bioengineering, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed in objective, formal language. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific principles.\n\nThe goal is to compute the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain, denoted as $G$, for a patient with a vestibular implant. The problem provides the necessary data and the definition of VOR gain.\n\nFirst, we establish a sign convention for angular velocity. Let rotation to the right be the positive direction. The head rotation is given as $\\dot{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{head}} = 150^\\circ/\\mathrm{s}$ to the right, which we can write as $\\dot{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{head}} = +150^\\circ/\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe compensatory eye movement is to the left. The measured eye angular velocity is $\\dot{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{eye}} = -120^\\circ/\\mathrm{s}$. The negative sign correctly indicates that the eye rotation is in the opposite direction to the head rotation, which is the definition of a compensatory movement.\n\nThe problem explicitly defines the VOR gain as \"the magnitude ratio of eye angular velocity to head angular velocity.\" We can express this definition mathematically as:\n$$G = \\frac{|\\dot{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{eye}}|}{|\\dot{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{head}}|}$$\nThe gain, $G$, is a dimensionless scalar quantity, as it is a ratio of two quantities with the same units.\n\nWe can now substitute the given values into this equation:\n$$G = \\frac{|-120^\\circ/\\mathrm{s}|}{|+150^\\circ/\\mathrm{s}|}$$\nThe absolute value operation removes the directional signs:\n$$G = \\frac{120^\\circ/\\mathrm{s}}{150^\\circ/\\mathrm{s}}$$\nThe units of angular velocity ($\\left.^\\circ\\right/\\mathrm{s}$) in the numerator and denominator cancel out, as expected for a dimensionless gain.\n$$G = \\frac{120}{150}$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$G = \\frac{12}{15} = \\frac{4}{5}$$\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$$G = 0.8$$\nThe problem requires the numerical answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The value $0.8$ is therefore expressed as $0.800$.\n\nThe fundamental requirement for stable gaze is that the angular velocity of the line of sight with respect to a world-fixed target is zero. This gaze velocity, $\\dot{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{gaze}}$, is the sum of the head velocity in space and the eye velocity relative to the head: $\\dot{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{gaze}} = \\dot{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{head}} + \\dot{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{eye}}$.

In that ideal case, $\\dot{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{gaze}} = \\dot{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{head}} + (-\\dot{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{head}}) = 0$.

Comparing our calculated value, $G = 0.800$, with the minimum threshold, we find that $0.800 > 0.75$.
