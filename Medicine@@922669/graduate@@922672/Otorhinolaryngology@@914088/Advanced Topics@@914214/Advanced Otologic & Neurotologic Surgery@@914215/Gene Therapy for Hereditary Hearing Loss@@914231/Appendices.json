Consider a consanguineous pedigree in which a single known founder OTOF mutation segregates as an autosomal recessive allele with complete penetrance and no effect on viability. Two first cousins plan to have children. Their shared grandparents are confirmed obligate heterozygous carriers for the same OTOF founder mutation, because they previously had at least one affected child with biallelic OTOF mutations. Each of the two first cousins is the child of a different unaffected child of these grandparents. Neither cousin has undergone molecular testing and both have normal hearing. Assume that the contribution of the same OTOF founder mutation from outside the shared lineage is negligible (that is, mating partners of the grandparents’ children are non-carriers for this specific founder allele), and that the only relevant locus is OTOF.\n\nStarting only from Mendel’s law of segregation, the definition of autosomal recessive inheritance, basic conditional probability, and Bayes’ theorem, derive the probability that the first child of these two first cousins will be homozygous for the founder OTOF mutation, and therefore eligible for a biallelic gene augmentation trial targeting this variant. Express the final probability as a decimal number and round your answer to four significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the probability that the first child of two first cousins will have an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a specific founder mutation. This is a classic problem in pedigree analysis that can be solved by applying Mendel’s law of segregation and the principles of conditional probability.\n\nLet us denote the normal (wild-type) allele as $A$ and the pathogenic founder OTOF mutation as $a$. Given that the inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive with complete penetrance, the genotypes correspond to the following phenotypes:\n- $AA$: Unaffected, non-carrier\n- $Aa$: Unaffected, heterozygous carrier\n- $aa$: Affected with otoferlin-related auditory neuropathy\n\nThe problem can be solved by systematically determining the probability of the relevant genotypes through the four generations of the pedigree.\n\n**Generation I: Shared Grandparents**\nThe shared grandparents are stated to be \"confirmed obligate heterozygous carriers\". This means both the grandfather and the grandmother have the genotype $Aa$.\n\n**Generation II: Parents of the Cousins**\nThe two first cousins are children of two different, unaffected siblings from Generation II. Let us determine the probability that one of these siblings (a \"lineage parent\" to a cousin) is a carrier.\nThe cross between the grandparents is $Aa \\times Aa$. According to Mendel's law of segregation, the probabilities for their offspring's genotypes are:\n- $P(AA) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $P(Aa) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- $P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nWe are given that these lineage parents are unaffected. Let $U$ be the event that an individual is unaffected. The probability of an offspring being unaffected is the sum of the probabilities of the genotypes that confer an unaffected phenotype:\n$$P(U) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nWe need to find the probability that an unaffected individual from this cross is a carrier, which is the conditional probability $P(Aa | U)$. Using the principles of conditional probability, which can be viewed as an application of Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(Aa | U) = \\frac{P(U | Aa) P(Aa)}{P(U)}$$\nHere, $P(U | Aa)$ is the probability of being unaffected given the genotype is $Aa$, which is $1$ due to the recessive nature of the allele. $P(Aa)$ is the prior probability of being a carrier, which is $\\frac{1}{2}$. $P(U)$ is the total probability of being unaffected, which we calculated as $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n$$P(Aa | U) = \\frac{1 \\times \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nTherefore, the probability that each lineage parent of the cousins is a carrier ($Aa$) is $\\frac{2}{3}$. The probability that they are a non-carrier homozygote ($AA$) is $1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Generation III: The First Cousins**\nEach cousin is the child of one such lineage parent and a partner from outside the family. The problem specifies that the contribution of the founder mutation from outside the lineage is negligible, meaning these outside partners have the genotype $AA$.\nLet's calculate the probability that one of the cousins is a carrier ($Aa$). A cousin can only be a carrier if their lineage parent is a carrier and passes on the $a$ allele.\nThe cross is either $(Aa \\text{ or } AA) \\times AA$.\nLet $C_{\\text{carrier}}$ be the event that a cousin is a carrier. Let $P_{\\text{carrier}}$ be the event that their lineage parent is a carrier.\n$$P(C_{\\text{carrier}}) = P(\\text{cousin is } Aa | P_{\\text{carrier}}) \\times P(P_{\\text{carrier}})$$\nIf the lineage parent is a carrier ($Aa$), the cross is $Aa \\times AA$. The probability of having a carrier child ($Aa$) from this cross is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe probability that the lineage parent is a carrier is $P(P_{\\text{carrier}}) = \\frac{2}{3}$ as determined above.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$P(C_{\\text{carrier}}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nNote that the problem statement that the cousins have normal hearing is consistent with this analysis, as a cross involving an $AA$ parent cannot produce an affected ($aa$) child. This information does not alter the calculated probabilities.\nSince the two cousins descend from different siblings in Generation II, their genotypes are independent events. Therefore, the probability that the other cousin is also a carrier is identically $\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\n**Generation IV: Child of the First Cousins**\nThe final step is to calculate the probability that the first child of these two cousins is homozygous for the mutation ($aa$). For this to occur, three independent events must happen:\n1. The first cousin must be a carrier ($Aa$). The probability is $P(C_1 = Aa) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n2. The second cousin must be a carrier ($Aa$). The probability is $P(C_2 = Aa) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n3. If both cousins are carriers, they must both pass the $a$ allele to their child. The cross is $Aa \\times Aa$, and the probability of having an affected child ($aa$) is $P(\\text{child is } aa | C_1 = Aa, C_2 = Aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe overall probability is the product of the probabilities of these independent events:\n$$P(\\text{child is } aa) = P(C_1 = Aa) \\times P(C_2 = Aa) \\times P(\\text{child is } aa | C_1=Aa, C_2=Aa)$$\n$$P(\\text{child is } aa) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{36}$$\n\n**Final Numerical Answer**\nThe problem requires the answer as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\frac{1}{36} = 0.027777...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.02778$.\nThis is the probability that the first child of the two cousins will be homozygous for the founder OTOF mutation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.02778}$$", "id": "5031086"}, {"introduction": "Once a therapeutic gene is identified, the next critical phase is the rational design of the delivery vector.
