A key property of this logarithmic scale is that a difference in decibel levels corresponds to a ratio of the underlying physical quantities (e.g., pressures). Gain, when expressed in decibels, is the difference between an output level and an input level.\n\nLet us define the relevant sound pressure levels at the test frequency of $2~\\mathrm{kHz}$:\n1.

Let $L_{\\text{aided}}$ be the SPL measured by the probe microphone near the tympanic membrane when the hearing aid is in place and turned on.\n\nFollowing the problem's directive, we define acoustic gain as the difference of levels measured under the same input stimulus.\n\nThe Real-Ear Unaided Gain (REUG) represents the natural amplification provided by the pinna and ear canal. It is the difference between the SPL at the eardrum and the SPL in the free field.\n$$\\text{REUG} = L_{\\text{unaided}} - L_{\\text{in}}$$\n\nThe Real-Ear Aided Gain (REAG) represents the total amplification provided by the hearing aid system combined with the ear's natural acoustics. It is the difference between the SPL at the eardrum with the aid on and the SPL in the free field.\n$$\\text{REAG} = L_{\\text{aided}} - L_{\\text{in}}$$\n\nThe Real-Ear Insertion Gain (REIG) is defined as the increase in SPL at the eardrum due to the insertion of the hearing aid. It is the difference between the aided SPL and the unaided SPL at the eardrum. It quantifies the net benefit provided by the hearing aid alone.\n$$\\text{REIG} = L_{\\text{aided}} - L_{\\text{unaided}}$$\n\nTo derive the expression for REIG in terms of the measured quantities REAG and REUG, we rearrange the first two equations:\n$$L_{\\text{aided}} = \\text{REAG} + L_{\\text{in}}$$\n$$L_{\\text{unaided}} = \\text{REUG} + L_{\\text{in}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the definition of REIG:\n$$\\text{REIG} = (\\text{REAG} + L_{\\text{in}}) - (\\text{REUG} + L_{\\text{in}})$$\nThe input level term, $L_{\\text{in}}$, cancels out:\n$$\\text{REIG} = \\text{REAG} - \\text{REUG}$$\nThis is the fundamental relationship between the three gain measures.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem requires analyzing the effects of doubling the vent diameter on low-frequency REIG and feedback risk.\n\n**1. Effect on Low-Frequency Real Ear Insertion Gain (REIG)**\n\nThe low-frequency REIG is related to the sound pressure, $P_e$, generated at the tympanic membrane by the hearing aid. The receiver is modeled as a volume velocity source, $U_s$, driving the parallel combination of the vent impedance, $Z_v$, and the ear canal impedance, $Z_e$.\n\nThe total volume velocity from the source splits between the two parallel paths: $U_s = U_v + U_e$.\nThe pressure, $P_e$, in the residual ear canal is the same across both parallel elements.\n$P_e = U_v Z_v = U_e Z_e$.\nFrom this, we can write the currents as $U_v = P_e / Z_v$ and $U_e = P_e / Z_e$.\nSubstituting back into the source equation:\n$$U_s = \\frac{P_e}{Z_v} + \\frac{P_e}{Z_e} = P_e \\left( \\frac{1}{Z_v} + \\frac{1}{Z_e} \\right)$$\nThe pressure at the eardrum is therefore:\n$$P_e = U_s \\left( \\frac{1}{Z_v} + \\frac{1}{Z_e} \\right)^{-1} = U_s \\frac{Z_v Z_e}{Z_v + Z_e}$$\nThis is the standard formula for the total impedance of two parallel elements, $Z_{total}$, so $P_e = U_s Z_{total}$.\n\nThe problem specifies low frequencies. At low frequencies, a vent is designed to have a low impedance to allow low-frequency sounds (like the user's own voice) to escape, thus reducing the occlusion effect. The ear canal, being a small enclosed volume, acts as a stiff spring (a compliance), presenting a high impedance.\nTherefore, at low frequencies, $|Z_v| \\ll |Z_e|$.\nThis implies that the admittance of the vent, $1/|Z_v|$, is much larger than the admittance of the ear canal, $1/|Z_e|$.\nThe sum of the admittances is thus dominated by the vent:\n$$\\frac{1}{Z_v} + \\frac{1}{Z_e} \\approx \\frac{1}{Z_v}$$\nThe pressure at the eardrum can then be approximated as:\n$$P_e \\approx U_s \\left( \\frac{1}{Z_v} \\right)^{-1} = U_s Z_v$$\nThis shows that at low frequencies, the pressure delivered to the eardrum is approximately proportional to the vent impedance, $Z_v$.\n\nNow, let's determine how $Z_v$ changes with the vent diameter, $d$.\nThe vent impedance is given by $Z_v = j \\omega M_v$.\nThe acoustic mass, $M_v$, scales as $M_v \\propto \\rho L / A$.\nThe length $L$ and air density $\\rho$ are constant. So, $M_v \\propto 1/A$.\nThe cross-sectional area of the circular vent is $A = \\pi (d/2)^2 = (\\pi/4) d^2$.\nSo, $A \\propto d^2$.\nCombining these, we get the dependence of acoustic mass on diameter: $M_v \\propto 1/d^2$.\nSince $Z_v \\propto M_v$, we have $Z_v \\propto 1/d^2$.\n\nThe vent diameter is changed from $d_1 = 1$ mm to $d_2 = 2$ mm, so $d_2 = 2 d_1$.\nLet $P_{e1}$ and $P_{e2}$ be the pressures before and after the change. The ratio of the new pressure to the old pressure is:\n$$\\frac{P_{e2}}{P_{e1}} \\approx \\frac{Z_{v2}}{Z_{v1}} = \\frac{1/d_2^2}{1/d_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{d_1}{d_2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThe pressure is reduced by a factor of $4$. The change in gain (or SPL) in decibels (dB) is calculated as:\n$$\\Delta \\text{Gain} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{P_{e2}}{P_{e1}} \\right) = 20 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = -20 \\log_{10}(4)$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\log_{10}(4) = \\log_{10}(2^2) = 2 \\log_{10}(2) \\approx 2 \\times 0.301 = 0.602$.\n$$\\Delta \\text{Gain} \\approx -20 \\times 0.602 = -12.04 \\text{ dB}$$\nThus, increasing the vent diameter from $1$ mm to $2$ mm decreases the low-frequency REIG by approximately $12$ dB.\n\n**2. Effect on Acoustic Feedback Risk**\n\nAcoustic feedback occurs when amplified sound from the receiver leaks from the ear canal and is picked up by the hearing aid's microphone, creating an unstable amplification loop (whistling). The main leakage path is the vent.\n\nA larger vent diameter creates a more open pathway between the ear canal (where the receiver outputs sound) and the outside environment (where the microphone is located). A more open path corresponds to a lower acoustic impedance, allowing more sound energy to leak out of the canal. This increases the acoustic coupling between the hearing aid's output and its input.\n\nIncreased acoustic coupling means that for a given amount of gain provided by the amplifier, the signal returning to the microphone is stronger. This makes the feedback loop a larger fraction of the amplified signal, bringing the system closer to the point of instability (where loop gain exceeds unity). Therefore, increasing the vent diameter increases the risk of acoustic feedback.\n\n**Summary of Effects:**\n- **Low-frequency REIG:** Decreases by approximately $12$ dB.\n- **Feedback Risk:** Increases.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Low-frequency REIG decreases by approximately $12$ dB; feedback risk increases due to higher acoustic coupling through the vent.**\n- The calculated decrease in REIG is approximately $12$ dB.

Low-frequency REIG increases by approximately $12$ dB; feedback risk decreases due to better seal.**\n- The low-frequency REIG decreases, not increases. This is incorrect.\n- A larger vent corresponds to a poorer (more open) seal, not a better one, and this increases feedback risk, not decreases it. This is incorrect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Low-frequency REIG is largely unchanged (less than $2$ dB); feedback risk unchanged.**\n- The calculated change in REIG is a significant decrease of $12$ dB, not a small change. This is incorrect.\n- The feedback risk is significantly affected (increased), not unchanged. This is incorrect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Low-frequency REIG decreases by approximately $6$ dB; feedback risk decreases because the larger vent interrupts the feedback path.**\n- A decrease of $6$ dB would correspond to the pressure being halved ($20 \\log_{10}(1/2) \\approx -6$ dB). This would imply $P_e \\propto 1/d$, but our derivation shows $P_e \\propto 1/d^2$. Thus, the magnitude of the decrease is incorrect.\n- The statement that a larger vent \"interrupts\" the feedback path is physically incorrect; it enhances it. This is incorrect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5032778"}, {"introduction": "All hearing aids must limit their maximum output to protect the user from uncomfortably or dangerously loud sounds.

From Parseval's theorem, the mean square ($MS$) of the signal is related to the Fourier coefficients by $MS = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_0^{2\\pi} p_{\\text{clip}}^2(\\theta)\\,d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n^2$.\nThis allows expressing THD as:\n$$\\mathrm{THD}^2 = \\frac{2 \\cdot MS - a_1^2}{a_1^2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot MS}{a_1^2} - 1$$\nWe first calculate the mean square, $MS$, using the symmetry $MS = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\pi} p_{\\text{clip}}^2(\\theta)\\,d\\theta$:\n$$MS = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[ \\int_0^{\\alpha} (P_m \\sin\\theta)^2 d\\theta + \\int_{\\alpha}^{\\pi-\\alpha} P_{\\text{lim}}^2 d\\theta + \\int_{\\pi-\\alpha}^{\\pi} (P_m \\sin\\theta)^2 d\\theta \\right]$$\nThe sum of the first and third integrals is $P_m^2(\\alpha - \\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha)$. The middle integral is $P_{\\text{lim}}^2(\\pi-2\\alpha)$.\n$$MS = \\frac{1}{\\pi} [ P_m^2(\\alpha - \\sin\\alpha\\cos\\alpha) + P_{\\text{lim}}^2(\\pi-2\\alpha) ]$$\nSubstituting $P_{\\text{lim}} = k P_m$, $\\sin\\alpha = k$, and $\\cos\\alpha = \\sqrt{1-k^2}$:\n$$MS = \\frac{P_m^2}{\\pi} [ \\alpha - k\\sqrt{1-k^2} + k^2(\\pi-2\\alpha) ] = \\frac{P_m^2}{\\pi} [ \\alpha(1-2k^2) - k\\sqrt{1-k^2} + \\pi k^2 ]$$\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculation for $k = 1/\\sqrt{10} \\approx 0.3162$:\n- $\\alpha = \\arcsin(1/\\sqrt{10}) \\approx 0.32175$ radians.\n- $a_1 = \\frac{2 P_m}{\\pi} [ 0.32175 + (1/\\sqrt{10})\\sqrt{1-1/10} ] = \\frac{2 P_m}{\\pi} [ 0.32175 + 0.3 ] = \\frac{2 P_m}{\\pi} (0.62175)$.\n- $a_1^2 = \\frac{4 P_m^2}{\\pi^2} (0.62175)^2 \\approx \\frac{4 P_m^2}{9.8696} (0.38657) \\approx 0.15668 P_m^2$.\n- $MS = \\frac{P_m^2}{\\pi} [ 0.32175(1-2/10) - 0.3 + \\pi/10 ] = \\frac{P_m^2}{\\pi} [ 0.32175(0.8) - 0.3 + 0.31416 ]$.\n- $MS = \\frac{P_m^2}{\\pi} [ 0.2574 - 0.3 + 0.31416 ] = \\frac{P_m^2}{\\pi} (0.27156) \\approx 0.08643 P_m^2$.\n- $\\mathrm{THD}^2 = \\frac{2 \\cdot (0.08643 P_m^2)}{0.15668 P_m^2} - 1 = \\frac{0.17286}{0.15668} - 1 \\approx 1.1032 - 1 = 0.1032$.\n- $\\mathrm{THD}_{\\text{clip}} = \\sqrt{0.1032} \\approx 0.3212$, or $32.12\\%$.\n\n**4. Analysis of Fast Compression Limiter**\n\nThe input signal is a steady $1$ kHz sinusoid. Its period is $T = 1 / (1000 \\text{ Hz}) = 1$ ms.\nThe compressor's envelope detector has an attack time $\\tau_a = 5$ ms and release time $\\tau_r = 50$ ms.\nFor a steady-state sinusoidal input, the envelope of the signal is constant. The compressor's control circuit, which operates on the time scale of $\\tau_a$ and $\\tau_r$, will detect this constant envelope and adjust the gain $g(t)$ to a constant value $g_{ss}$. The dynamics of attack and release only matter when the input signal's envelope changes.\nSince the control time constants ($\\tau_a, \\tau_r$) are significantly larger than the signal period $T$ ($5 \\text{ ms} > 1 \\text{ ms}$ and $50 \\text{ ms} > 1 \\text{ ms}$), the gain modulation cannot and does not follow the rapid oscillations of the $1$ kHz waveform itself.\nOnce in steady state, the compressor applies a constant gain reduction. The output remains a pure sinusoid, but with its amplitude reduced to match the ceiling of $110$ dB SPL. A pure sinusoid, by definition, has no harmonic components.\nTherefore, the THD of the compression-limited output is $\\mathrm{THD}_{\\text{comp}} = 0\\%$.\n\nThe difference in THD is $\\mathrm{THD}_{\\text{clip}} - \\mathrm{THD}_{\\text{comp}} \\approx 32.12\\% - 0\\% = 32.12\\%$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. Fast compression limiting uses envelope-based gain reduction with $\\tau_a$ sufficiently larger than the waveform period so that $g(t)$ is effectively constant over cycles in steady state, preserving the sinusoidal shape; the expected THD difference versus peak clipping for this $90$ decibels Sound Pressure Level input is approximately $32\\%$ (compression $\\approx 0\\%$, clipping $\\approx 32\\%$).**\n  - The mechanistic description is precise and accurate. The compressor gain $g(t)$ is constant in steady-state for a constant-envelope input because the time constants are much larger than the signal period. This preserves the sinusoidal waveform.\n  - The calculated THD values for compression ($\\approx 0\\%$) and peak clipping ($\\approx 32\\%$) are correct.\n  - The stated THD difference of $\\approx 32\\%$ is consistent with the derived values.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Peak clipping produces lower THD than fast compression limiting because instantaneous gain does not change; the expected THD difference is negative, approximately $-10\\%$.**\n  - The premise that peak clipping produces lower THD is false; it is a highly nonlinear process that generates significant harmonics. The reasoning (\"because instantaneous gain does not change\") is nonsensical in this context; the waveform isnon-linearly reshaped, which is the cause of distortion. The numerical value is incorrect.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Fast compression limiting eliminates distortion entirely and yields more than $50\\%$ lower THD than peak clipping for this input.**\n  - It is true that fast compression limiting eliminates distortion *for this specific steady-state sinusoidal input*. However, the claim that the THD is \"more than $50\\%$ lower\" is numerically false. The THD for clipping is $\\approx 32\\%$. The reduction is therefore $\\approx 32$ percentage points, not more than $50$.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Both methods yield similar THD (about $10\\%$) because the ceiling is the same; therefore, the difference is negligible.**\n  - The premise that both methods yield similar THD is false. The methods are fundamentally different in their effect on the waveform. The numerical value of $\\approx 10\\%$ is incorrect for both methods.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5032779"}]}
