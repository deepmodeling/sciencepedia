It provides all necessary definitions, constraints, and numerical values to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution for both the derivation and the calculation.\n    -   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and standard scientific terms.\n\nThe problem is determined to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Force Level Expression**\n\nThe fundamental definition of a level in decibels ($dB$) is based on the ratio of two powers, a measured power $P$ and a reference power $P_{\\text{ref}}$.\n$$L_P = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{P}{P_{\\text{ref}}}\\right)$$\nThe problem specifies that under the given conditions, the power $P$ is proportional to the square of the force amplitude $F$. This relationship can be expressed using a constant of proportionality, $k$:\n$$P = k F^2$$\nThe constant $k$ is determined by the physical properties of the load (the artificial mastoid). Since the reference level is established using the same physical system, the reference power $P_{\\text{ref}}$ is related to the reference force $F_{\\text{ref}}$ by the same constant $k$.\n$$P_{\\text{ref}} = k F_{\\text{ref}}^2$$\nSubstituting these expressions for $P$ and $P_{\\text{ref}}$ into the fundamental decibel equation yields:\n$$L_P = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k F^2}{k F_{\\text{ref}}^2}\\right)$$\nThe constant of proportionality $k$ is present in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus cancels out. This cancellation is key, as it demonstrates that the resulting level is independent of the specific load characteristics, provided they remain constant.\n$$L_P = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{F^2}{F_{\\text{ref}}^2}\\right)$$\nThe expression inside the logarithm can be written as a squared ratio:\n$$L_P = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\left(\\frac{F}{F_{\\text{ref}}}\\right)^2\\right)$$\nUsing the power rule for logarithms, $\\log_b(x^y) = y \\log_b(x)$, the exponent $2$ can be moved to multiply the term in front of the logarithm:\n$$L_P = (2) \\times 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{F}{F_{\\text{ref}}}\\right)$$\n$$L_P = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{F}{F_{\\text{ref}}}\\right)$$\nThis expression represents the level in decibels for a quantity whose square is proportional to power (often termed a \"field quantity\"). When this quantity is force, the level is specifically called the force level, denoted as $L_F$.\n$$L_F = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{F}{F_{\\text{ref}}}\\right)$$\nThis completes the required derivation from first principles.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Force Level**\n\nThe task is to compute the decibel force level (dB FL) using the derived formula for the given values.\nThe given values are:\n-   Measured force amplitude: $F = 1\\ \\text{mN} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{N}$.\n-   Reference force amplitude: $F_{\\text{ref}} = 1\\ \\mu\\text{N} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{N}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratio of the measured force amplitude to the reference force amplitude.\n$$\\frac{F}{F_{\\text{ref}}} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-3}}{1 \\times 10^{-6}} = 10^{-3 - (-6)} = 10^3$$\nNext, we substitute this ratio into the derived expression for the force level $L_F$:\n$$L_F = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(10^3\\right)$$\nThe base-10 logarithm of $10^3$ is, by definition, $3$.\n$$L_F = 20 \\times 3$$\n$$L_F = 60$$\nThus, the force level for a force of $1\\ \\text{mN}$ relative to a reference of $1\\ \\mu\\text{N}$ is $60$ dB FL.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{60}$$", "id": "5010750"}, {"introduction": "Once an implant delivers a known force, the next critical question is how the skull responds to that force.

For a general mechanical system subjected to an external driving force $F(t)$, the equation of motion can be formulated. In a linear, time-invariant (LTI) system, the internal reaction forces are proportional to the displacement $x(t)$ and its time derivatives. For a one-dimensional system with effective mass $m$, mechanical resistance $R_m$, and stiffness $k$, the governing differential equation is:\n$$m \\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2} + R_m \\frac{dx(t)}{dt} + k x(t) = F(t)$$\n\nThe problem specifies a sinusoidal driving force applied at a frequency of $f = 250\\,\\text{Hz}$. The angular frequency is $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. The force can be represented using complex exponential notation as $F(t) = \\text{Re}\\{\\mathbf{F} e^{i\\omega t}\\}$, where $\\mathbf{F}$ is the complex force amplitude, and its magnitude $|\\mathbf{F}|$ is the peak amplitude, given as $F_0 = 0.2\\,\\text{N}$.\n\nThe following assumptions are explicitly made, as requested:\n1.  **Linearity**: The system's parameters ($m$, $R_m$, $k$) are constant and do not depend on the amplitude of the force or displacement. This is justified by the problem statement that the actuator operates \"well within its linear range\".\n2.  **Steady-State**: It is assumed that the system has been driven for a sufficient duration to reach a steady state, where any initial transient behavior has decayed.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the response of the LTI system to a sinusoidal input is also a sinusoid at the same frequency $\\omega$, but with a different amplitude and phase. The displacement can be written as $x(t) = \\text{Re}\\{\\mathbf{X} e^{i\\omega t}\\}$, where $\\mathbf{X}$ is the complex displacement amplitude.\n\nSubstituting the complex forms of $x(t)$ and $F(t)$ into the equation of motion, the time derivatives become multiplications by $i\\omega$:\n$$ m(i\\omega)^2 \\mathbf{X} + R_m(i\\omega) \\mathbf{X} + k \\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{F} $$\n$$ (-m\\omega^2 + i\\omega R_m + k) \\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{F} $$\n\nThe core definition of dynamic mechanical compliance, $\\mathbf{C}_m(\\omega)$, is the frequency-dependent ratio of the complex displacement amplitude to the complex force amplitude:\n$$ \\mathbf{C}_m(\\omega) = \\frac{\\mathbf{X}}{\\mathbf{F}} $$\nFrom the equation of motion, we can see that the compliance is the inverse of the term in parentheses, which is the complex mechanical stiffness or dynamic stiffness:\n$$ \\mathbf{C}_m(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{k - m\\omega^2 + i\\omega R_m} $$\nThis expression connects the phenomenological concept of compliance to the fundamental physical properties of a model system. For a complex distributed system like the skull, $\\mathbf{C}_m(\\omega)$ is a transfer function that is measured experimentally.\n\nThe problem provides the *magnitude* of the dynamic mechanical compliance at the stimulus frequency, $C_m = |\\mathbf{C}_m(\\omega)| = 1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m/N}$. To find the displacement amplitude $X_0 = |\\mathbf{X}|$, we take the magnitude of the defining relationship $\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{C}_m(\\omega) \\mathbf{F}$:\n$$ |\\mathbf{X}| = |\\mathbf{C}_m(\\omega) \\mathbf{F}| = |\\mathbf{C}_m(\\omega)| |\\mathbf{F}| $$\n$$ X_0 = C_m F_0 $$\nThis provides a direct relationship between the force amplitude and the displacement amplitude via the compliance magnitude.\n\nWe are given:\n- Force amplitude: $F_0 = 0.2\\,\\text{N}$\n- Compliance magnitude: $C_m = 1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m/N}$\n\nWe can now calculate the displacement amplitude $X_0$:\n$$ X_0 = (1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m/N}) \\times (0.2\\,\\text{N}) = 0.2 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m} = 2 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{m} $$\nTo express this result in nanometers ($\\text{nm}$), we use the conversion $1\\,\\text{m} = 10^9\\,\\text{nm}$:\n$$ X_0 = (2 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{m}) \\times \\left(\\frac{10^9\\,\\text{nm}}{1\\,\\text{m}}\\right) = 20\\,\\text{nm} $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives $20.0\\,\\text{nm}$.\n\nFinally, we address how coupling loss would be incorporated. The provided compliance, $C_m$, is specified \"at the actuator-to-bone interface\" and represents the skull's response, which we can denote $\\mathbf{C}_{skull}(\\omega)$. Coupling loss occurs in the soft tissue and fixture between the actuator's internal motor and the bone. This coupling path can be modeled as another mechanical element with its own compliance, $\\mathbf{C}_{coupling}(\\omega)$. Since this element is mechanically in series with the skull, the total compliance, $\\mathbf{C}_{total}(\\omega)$, as seen by the actuator's motor would be the sum of the individual compliances:\n$$ \\mathbf{C}_{total}(\\omega) = \\mathbf{C}_{coupling}(\\omega) + \\mathbf{C}_{skull}(\\omega) $$\nThe term $\\mathbf{C}_{coupling}(\\omega)$ formally represents the coupling losses. Its real part would correspond to energy dissipated as heat in the soft tissue. This addition does not change the numerical estimate reported ($20.0\\,\\text{nm}$) because the problem provides the force ($F = 0.2\\,\\text{N}$) and compliance ($C_m$) *at the bone interface*. Our calculation determines the bone's displacement based on the force it actually experiences, downstream of any coupling losses.

We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part response: a definition of functional gain, a derivation of the speech-weighted equivalent functional gain from first principles, and the calculation of its value.\n\nFirst, we define the functional gain at a specific frequency. The functional gain, $G(f)$, at a frequency $f$ is the improvement in hearing threshold achieved with the hearing implant. It is calculated as the difference between the unaided threshold, $T_u(f)$, and the aided threshold, $T_a(f)$, both expressed in decibels Hearing Level ($\\mathrm{dB\\,HL}$).\n$$G(f) = T_u(f) - T_a(f)$$\nFor the given patient, the functional gains at the specified octave frequencies are:\n- At $f = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$: $G(0.5) = 55\\,\\mathrm{dB} - 30\\,\\mathrm{dB} = 25\\,\\mathrm{dB}$\n- At $f = 1\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$: $G(1) = 60\\,\\mathrm{dB} - 32\\,\\mathrm{dB} = 28\\,\\mathrm{dB}$\n- At $f = 2\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$: $G(2) = 65\\,\\mathrm{dB} - 35\\,\\mathrm{dB} = 30\\,\\mathrm{dB}$\n- At $f = 4\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$: $G(4) = 70\\,\\mathrm{dB} - 45\\,\\mathrm{dB} = 25\\,\\mathrm{dB}$\n\nNext, we derive the broadband speech-weighted equivalent functional gain, denoted $G_{eq}$. The problem mandates a derivation from first principles, based on the relationship between the decibel level $L$ and the corresponding acoustic power $P$. The assumption is that the required power to reach threshold is proportional to $10^{L/10}$, where $L$ is the threshold in $\\mathrm{dB\\,HL}$. Let this relationship be $P \\propto 10^{L/10}$. We can write this as $P = C \\cdot 10^{L/10}$, where $C$ is a constant of proportionality.

Instead, we must average the underlying linear quantities, which in this case are the powers, weighted by their importance for speech.
