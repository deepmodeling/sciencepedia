The description of adductor spasmodic dysphonia, including its characteristic phonatory breaks, particularly on vowel-initial words, is consistent with established medical and scientific literature. The method of calculating an event rate (in this case, breaks per $100$ words) is a standard and valid quantitative practice in clinical voice assessment.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary information to compute the requested rate. The definition of the rate is explicitly stated: \"the count of discrete phonatory interruptions...normalized to a base of $100$ words.\" This clearly indicates that the total number of words should be used as the denominator for the base rate calculation. The quantities are unambiguous.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective clinical terminology. It is free from subjective claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. The provided data are sufficient. The information about the number of vowel-initial words ($5$) serves as clinical context, explaining the phonatory environment in which the breaks occurred, but it does not create a contradiction. The primary instruction is to compute the break rate \"per $100$ words\", which refers to the total word count, not a subset thereof. Thus, the data are consistent.\n- **Realism:** The values given ($3$ breaks in a $13$-word sentence) represent a realistic scenario for an individual with spasmodic dysphonia.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to compute the voice break rate per $100$ words. This is a normalized frequency calculation. Let the desired rate be denoted by $R_{100}$. The rate is defined as the number of observed events (voice breaks) divided by the total sample size (total number of words), with the result multiplied by the normalization factor ($100$).\n\nThe formula for the rate is:\n$$R_{100} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of voice breaks}}{\\text{Total number of words}} \\right) \\times 100$$\n\nUsing the provided variables:\n$$R_{100} = \\left( \\frac{N_{breaks}}{N_{words}} \\right) \\times 100$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\n- Number of voice breaks, $N_{breaks} = 3$.\n- Total number of words, $N_{words} = 13$.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$R_{100} = \\left( \\frac{3}{13} \\right) \\times 100$$\n\nFirst, the ratio is calculated:\n$$\\frac{3}{13} \\approx 0.23076923...$$\n\nNext, this ratio is multiplied by $100$ to normalize it to the specified base:\n$$R_{100} \\approx 0.23076923... \\times 100 = 23.076923...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The digits of the unrounded number are $2$, $3$, $0$, $7$, $6$, $9$, ...\nThe first four significant figures are $2$, $3$, $0$, and $7$. The fifth significant figure is $6$. Since $6 \\ge 5$, the fourth significant figure must be rounded up.\nTherefore, the value $23.07$ is rounded up to $23.08$.\n\nThe calculated voice break rate is $23.08$ breaks per $100$ words.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{23.08} $$", "id": "5071787"}, {"introduction": "Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) injection into the laryngeal muscles is the cornerstone of treatment for Spasmodic Dysphonia.
