The resulting contingency counts are as follows: among histopathology-positive cases ($D+$), $68$ had an endoscopic impression of RRP present ($T+$) and $12$ had an endoscopic impression of RRP absent ($T-$); among histopathology-negative cases ($D-$), $30$ had an endoscopic impression of RRP present ($T+$) and $90$ had an endoscopic impression of RRP absent ($T-$).\n\nUsing the counting data and the core definitions of sensitivity and specificity grounded in conditional probability with respect to the reference standard, compute the sensitivity and the specificity of endoscopic impression for detecting RRP.

Substituting this into the previous equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{patient}}}{k \\times \\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}}} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{reference}}}{k \\times \\text{CrCl}_{\\text{reference}}}\n$$\nThe constant $k$ cancels on both sides, yielding the fundamental relationship for dose adjustment in this context:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{patient}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}}} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{reference}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{reference}}}\n$$\nRearranging to solve for the patient's adjusted dose, $\\text{Dose}_{\\text{patient}}$:\n$$\n\\text{Dose}_{\\text{patient}} = \\text{Dose}_{\\text{reference}} \\times \\frac{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{reference}}}\n$$\nThe first step is to calculate the patient's creatinine clearance, $\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}}$, using the Cockcroft-Gault equation for males:\n$$\n\\text{CrCl} (\\text{in mL/min}) = \\frac{({140} - \\text{Age in years}) \\times \\text{Weight in kg}}{\\text{Serum Creatinine in mg/dL} \\times {72}}\n$$\nSubstituting the patient's data: Age = $34$ years, Weight = $68$ kg, and Serum Creatinine (SCr) = $1.8$ mg/dL:\n$$\n\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{patient}} = \\frac{({140} - {34}) \\times {68}}{{1.8} \\times {72}} = \\frac{{106} \\times {68}}{{129.6}} = \\frac{{7208}}{{129.6}} \\approx {55.61728395}... \\, \\text{mL/min}\n$$\nNext, we determine the reference dose, $\\text{Dose}_{\\text{reference}}$. This is the dose that would be given to the patient if their renal function were normal, i.e., at the reference clearance level. The reference regimen is $5$ mg/kg.
