The result is mathematically derivable and verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be generated.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected number of malignancies in a group of $15$ patients, derived from foundational principles.\n\nLet $N=15$ be the number of patients. The outcome for each patient's biopsy is a random event. For the $i$-th patient (where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $15$), let us define a random variable $X_i$. This variable will represent the outcome of the biopsy. Since the outcome is binary (malignant or not malignant), this is a Bernoulli trial. We assign a numerical value to each outcome:\n-   $X_i = 1$ if the ulcer is malignant.\n-   $X_i = 0$ if the ulcer is not malignant.\n\nThe problem states that the probability of malignancy is $p = 0.20$. Therefore, for each patient $i$, the probability distribution of the Bernoulli random variable $X_i$ is:\n-   $P(X_i = 1) = p = 0.20$\n-   $P(X_i = 0) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$\n\nThe foundational definition of the expected value (or mean) of a discrete random variable $Y$ that can take values $y_k$ with probabilities $P(Y=y_k)$ is given by the sum:\n$$E[Y] = \\sum_k y_k P(Y=y_k)$$\n\nWe apply this definition to our Bernoulli random variable $X_i$ for a single patient. The possible values are $1$ and $0$.\n$$E[X_i] = (1 \\times P(X_i = 1)) + (0 \\times P(X_i = 0))$$\nSubstituting the probabilities:\n$$E[X_i] = (1 \\times p) + (0 \\times (1-p)) = p$$\nSo, the expected number of malignancies for a single patient is $E[X_i] = p = 0.20$.\n\nThe total number of malignancies detected in the sample of $N=15$ patients is the sum of the outcomes for each individual patient. Let us define a new random variable, $S$, as this total sum:\n$$S = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + \\dots + X_{15} = \\sum_{i=1}^{15} X_i$$\n\nWe are asked to find the expected value of $S$, denoted $E[S]$. A fundamental property of expectation is its linearity. The expected value of a sum of random variables is equal to the sum of their individual expected values. This property holds true regardless of whether the random variables are independent.\n$$E[S] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{15} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{15} E[X_i]$$\n\nAs established, each biopsy is an identical Bernoulli trial. Therefore, the expected value for each $X_i$ is the same:\n$$E[X_i] = p \\text{ for all } i = 1, 2, \\dots, 15$$\n\nSubstituting this into the sum:\n$$E[S] = \\sum_{i=1}^{15} p = E[X_1] + E[X_2] + \\dots + E[X_{15}]$$\n$$E[S] = p + p + \\dots + p \\quad (15 \\text{ times})$$\n$$E[S] = 15 \\times p$$\n\nThis derivation uses only the foundational definitions of a Bernoulli variable, the expected value of a discrete random variable, and the linearity of expectation, as required. It does not invoke the shortcut formula for the mean of a binomial distribution directly, but rather derives it for this specific context.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values, $N=15$ and $p=0.20$:\n$$E[S] = 15 \\times 0.20 = 3.0$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a unitless expected count rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $3$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $3.000$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.000}\n$$", "id": "5008349"}, {"introduction": "Beyond predicting event frequency, a clinician must critically evaluate the tools used for diagnosis.

We use Bayes' theorem to find this value:\n$$ PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$ P(T^+) = (0.85)(0.30) + (0.10)(0.70) $$\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.255 + 0.070 = 0.325 $$\nNow we can compute the $PPV$:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{0.255}{0.325} \\approx 0.78461538... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $PPV = 0.7846$.\n\nThe $NPV$ is the probability that a lesion does not have dysplasia given that the test is negative, i.e., $P(D^c | T^-)$. We again use Bayes' theorem:\n$$ NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test result. Using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D) $$\nAlternatively, since there are only two test outcomes (positive or negative), $P(T^-) = 1 - P(T^+)$.\n$$ P(T^-) = 1 - 0.325 = 0.675 $$\nLet's verify this using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^-) = (0.90)(0.70) + (0.15)(0.30) $$\n$$ P(T^-) = 0.630 + 0.045 = 0.675 $$\nThe results are consistent.

All necessary parameters and assumptions are provided, and there are no contradictions or scientific inaccuracies. I will proceed with the derivation of the required sample size.\n\nThe objective is to determine the sample size for a two-arm clinical trial designed to compare two proportions. Let $p_1$ be the malignant transformation probability in the control arm and $p_2$ be the probability in the intervention arm. The trial is designed to test the following hypotheses:\nNull hypothesis, $H_0: p_1 = p_2$ (or $p_1 - p_2 = 0$).\nAlternative hypothesis, $H_A: p_1 \\ne p_2$ (or $p_1 - p_2 \\ne 0$).\n\nThe design parameters are given as:\nExpected control arm probability, $p_1 = 0.12$.\nHypothesized intervention arm probability, $p_2 = 0.06$.\nType I error rate, $\\alpha = 0.05$.\nTarget power, $1 - \\beta = 0.80$.\n\nThe sample sizes in the two arms are equal, denoted by $n_1 = n_2 = n$.

The test is based on their difference, $\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2$. For a large-sample test, the test statistic under the null hypothesis is constructed. Under $H_0$, where $p_1=p_2=p$, the variance of the difference $\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2$ is $\\frac{p(1-p)}{n} + \\frac{p(1-p)}{n} = \\frac{2p(1-p)}{n}$. Since the common proportion $p$ is unknown, it is estimated using a pooled proportion from the sample data. For design purposes, we must model this behavior. The variance under $H_0$ is planned using an estimate for the common proportion, typically the average of the hypothesized proportions, $\\bar{p} = \\frac{p_1 + p_2}{2}$.\nThe standard error of the difference under $H_0$ is thus specified as:\n$$ SE_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n}} $$\n\nFor a two-sided test with significance level $\\alpha$, the null hypothesis is rejected if the observed difference is sufficiently far from zero.
