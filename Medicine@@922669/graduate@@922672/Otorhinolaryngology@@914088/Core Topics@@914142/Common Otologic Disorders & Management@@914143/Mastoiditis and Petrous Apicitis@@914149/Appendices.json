It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Bayesian inference as applied to medical diagnostics, a well-established and rigorous field. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary quantitative data—a pre-test probability, a positive likelihood ratio, and a decision threshold—to compute a unique and meaningful post-test probability and make a subsequent interpretation. The language is objective and the values provided ($LR^{+}=3$, $p=0.25$) are clinically plausible.\n\nThe task is to update a prior probability of a disease based on a new diagnostic finding. This is a classic application of Bayes' theorem. We are given the pre-test probability of coalescent mastoiditis, and we need to calculate the post-test probability after receiving a specific CT scan result.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has coalescent mastoiditis.\nLet $T$ be the event of a positive test result, which in this case is the CT finding of \"mastoid air cell opacification without visible bony erosion.\"\n\nThe given information is:\n1.  The pre-test probability of disease: $P(D) = p = 0.25$.\n2.  The positive likelihood ratio for the test finding: $LR^{+} = 3$.\n3.  The decision threshold for surgery: $p_{t} = 0.65$.\n\nWe seek to compute the post-test probability, $P(D|T)$, which is the probability of having the disease given the positive test result.\n\nThe relationship between pre-test probability, post-test probability, and the likelihood ratio can be expressed in several ways derived from Bayes' theorem. A convenient form uses odds. The pre-test odds of disease are defined as the ratio of the probability of having the disease to the probability of not having it:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(D)}{1 - P(D)}\n$$\nThe post-test odds are found by multiplying the pre-test odds by the likelihood ratio:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR^{+}\n$$\nFinally, the post-test probability can be recovered from the post-test odds:\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}\n$$\nAlternatively, a direct formula relating pre-test probability $P(D)$ and the likelihood ratio $LR^{+}$ to the post-test probability $P(D|T)$ can be derived. Bayes' theorem states:\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T)}\n$$\nUsing the law of total probability, the denominator $P(T)$ is $P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$, where $D^c$ is the event of not having the disease. The likelihood ratio is $LR^{+} = \\frac{P(T|D)}{P(T|D^c)}$. Substituting these into Bayes' theorem and rearranging gives:\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{LR^{+} \\cdot P(D)}{LR^{+} \\cdot P(D) + (1 - P(D))}\n$$\nThis formula is computationally direct. We will use it for the calculation.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$P(D) = 0.25$\n$LR^{+} = 3$\n\nThe probability of not having the disease before the test is:\n$1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n\nNow, we compute the post-test probability, $P(D|T)$:\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{3 \\times 0.25}{3 \\times 0.25 + (1 - 0.25)}\n$$\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{0.75}{0.75 + 0.75}\n$$\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{0.75}{1.5}\n$$\n$$\nP(D|T) = 0.5\n$$\nThe post-test probability of coalescent mastoiditis after the CT scan result is $0.5$.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires an interpretation of this result in the context of a decision threshold for surgery. The given threshold is $p_{t} = 0.65$. The calculated post-test probability is $P(D|T) = 0.5$.\nWe compare the two values:\n$$\n0.5 < 0.65\n$$\nSince the post-test probability $P(D|T)$ is less than the decision threshold $p_t$, the criterion for recommending urgent mastoidectomy is not met based on this analysis alone.

It is a well-formed exercise in applied mathematics and physics within a relevant medical context. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe primary objective is to compute the minimal distance between the surfaces of two spherical regions, defined by their centers and radii. This distance, $d_{\\text{surface}}$, is the distance between the centers of the spheres minus the sum of their radii.\n\nFirst, we calculate the distance between the centers of the two spheres, $d_{\\text{center}} = \\left\\|\\mathbf{r}(i_{m}, j_{m}, k_{m}) - \\mathbf{r}(i_{p}, j_{p}, k_{p})\\right\\|$.\nThe displacement vector between the two centers is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{m} - \\mathbf{r}_{p} = (\\mathbf{r}_{0} + \\Delta x \\, i_{m} \\, \\mathbf{u} + \\Delta y \\, j_{m} \\, \\mathbf{v} + \\Delta z \\, k_{m} \\, \\mathbf{w}) - (\\mathbf{r}_{0} + \\Delta x \\, i_{p} \\, \\mathbf{u} + \\Delta y \\, j_{p} \\, \\mathbf{v} + \\Delta z \\, k_{p} \\, \\mathbf{w})\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_{m} - \\mathbf{r}_{p} = \\Delta x (i_{m} - i_{p}) \\mathbf{u} + \\Delta y (j_{m} - j_{p}) \\mathbf{v} + \\Delta z (k_{m} - k_{p}) \\mathbf{w}\n$$\nLet $\\Delta i = i_{m} - i_{p}$, $\\Delta j = j_{m} - j_{p}$, and $\\Delta k = k_{m} - k_{p}$. The displacement vector is $\\Delta\\mathbf{r} = \\Delta x \\, \\Delta i \\, \\mathbf{u} + \\Delta y \\, \\Delta j \\, \\mathbf{v} + \\Delta z \\, \\Delta k \\, \\mathbf{w}$.\n\nThe distance $d_{\\text{center}}$ is the magnitude of this vector, $d_{\\text{center}} = \\|\\Delta\\mathbf{r}\\|$. The squared distance is the dot product of the vector with itself:\n$$\nd_{\\text{center}}^2 = (\\Delta x \\, \\Delta i \\, \\mathbf{u} + \\Delta y \\, \\Delta j \\, \\mathbf{v} + \\Delta z \\, \\Delta k \\, \\mathbf{w}) \\cdot (\\Delta x \\, \\Delta i \\, \\mathbf{u} + \\Delta y \\, \\Delta j \\, \\mathbf{v} + \\Delta z \\, \\Delta k \\, \\mathbf{w})\n$$\nExpanding the dot product:\n$$\nd_{\\text{center}}^2 = (\\Delta x \\Delta i)^2 (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) + (\\Delta y \\Delta j)^2 (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) + (\\Delta z \\Delta k)^2 (\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}) + 2(\\Delta x \\Delta i)(\\Delta y \\Delta j)(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) + 2(\\Delta x \\Delta i)(\\Delta z \\Delta k)(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}) + 2(\\Delta y \\Delta j)(\\Delta z \\Delta k)(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w})\n$$\nThe problem states that $\\{\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}\\}$ is an orthonormal basis because $\\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}$ and $\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}$ are themselves orthonormal.

This ganglion is the source of the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), which provides sensory innervation to the face. Petrous apicitis is an infection and inflammation of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, an anatomical structure in immediate proximity to Meckel's cave.\n2.  **Pathophysiology:** Inflammation of the petrous apex can easily spread to or exert mass effect upon adjacent structures. Irritation of the trigeminal ganglion by this inflammatory process is the direct cause of severe facial pain (trigeminal neuralgia), a hallmark symptom of Gradenigo's syndrome, which is a complication of petrous apicitis.\n3.  **Clinical Significance of the Calculated Distance:** The calculated surface-to-surface distance of approximately $1.348$ mm represents the shortest distance between the boundary of the inflammatory lesion and the boundary of the space containing the trigeminal ganglion. In macroscopic anatomical terms, this is a very small separation. Inflammatory processes involve the release of chemical mediators and the development of edema, which can readily affect tissues over a distance of several millimeters. Therefore, a geometric separation of this magnitude provides a strong quantitative basis for concluding that the inflammatory process at the petrous apex is highly likely to be irritating the trigeminal ganglion in Meckel's cave.
