It is a standard problem in occupational hygiene and audio engineering.\n\nThe core task is to derive an expression for the combined sound level from two independent sources and then compute its value. The derivation begins from the fundamental definition of sound intensity level. The sound level $L$, measured in decibels (dB), is defined as a logarithmic ratio of a sound intensity $I$ to a reference intensity $I_0$:\n$$L = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I}{I_0}\\right)$$\nIn this problem, we are given A-weighted sound levels, denoted as $\\mathrm{dB(A)}$. This implies that the intensities have been filtered according to the A-weighting curve. Let the A-weighted sound levels of the two independent sources be $L_{A,1}$ and $L_{A,2}$.\n$$L_{A,1} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_{A,1}}{I_0}\\right)$$\n$$L_{A,2} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_{A,2}}{I_0}\\right)$$\nHere, $I_{A,1}$ and $I_{A,2}$ are the respective A-weighted sound intensities of Source A and Source B. The problem statement provides $L_{A,1} = 88 \\ \\mathrm{dB(A)}$ and $L_{A,2} = 91 \\ \\mathrm{dB(A)}$.\n\nTo find the combined level, we first need to express the individual intensities $I_{A,1}$ and $I_{A,2}$ in terms of their corresponding levels $L_{A,1}$ and $L_{A,2}$. We can rearrange the definition of the level:\n$$\\frac{L_{A,1}}{10} = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_{A,1}}{I_0}\\right) \\implies 10^{L_{A,1}/10} = \\frac{I_{A,1}}{I_0}$$\nSolving for the intensity $I_{A,1}$ gives:\n$$I_{A,1} = I_0 \\cdot 10^{L_{A,1}/10}$$\nSimilarly, for the second source:\n$$I_{A,2} = I_0 \\cdot 10^{L_{A,2}/10}$$\n\nA key principle stated in the problem is that for independent (uncorrelated) noise sources, their intensities add linearly. Therefore, the total A-weighted intensity, $I_{A,total}$, when both sources are operating simultaneously is the sum of their individual intensities:\n$$I_{A,total} = I_{A,1} + I_{A,2}$$\nThe combined A-weighted sound level, $L_{A,total}$, is then found by substituting this total intensity back into the level definition:\n$$L_{A,total} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_{A,total}}{I_0}\\right) = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_{A,1} + I_{A,2}}{I_0}\\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $I_{A,1}$ and $I_{A,2}$ in terms of their levels:\n$$L_{A,total} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_0 \\cdot 10^{L_{A,1}/10} + I_0 \\cdot 10^{L_{A,2}/10}}{I_0}\\right)$$\nThe reference intensity $I_0$ is a common factor in the numerator and denominator, so it cancels out. This yields the general analytic expression for the combined sound level from two independent sources:\n$$L_{A,total} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(10^{L_{A,1}/10} + 10^{L_{A,2}/10}\\right)$$\nThis formula represents the logarithmic addition of sound levels and is valid for any number of uncorrelated sources by extending the sum inside the logarithm.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically for the given values $L_{A,1} = 88 \\ \\mathrm{dB(A)}$ and $L_{A,2} = 91 \\ \\mathrm{dB(A)}$.\n$$L_{A,total} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(10^{88/10} + 10^{91/10}\\right)$$\n$$L_{A,total} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(10^{8.8} + 10^{9.1}\\right)$$\nTo compute this, we can factor out one of the terms to simplify the calculation:\n$$L_{A,total} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(10^{8.8}(1 + 10^{9.1-8.8})\\right) = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(10^{8.8}(1 + 10^{0.3})\\right)$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\log(a \\cdot b) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)$:\n$$L_{A,total} = 10 \\left[ \\log_{10}(10^{8.8}) + \\log_{10}(1 + 10^{0.3}) \\right]$$\n$$L_{A,total} = 10 \\left[ 8.8 + \\log_{10}(1 + 10^{0.3}) \\right]$$\nWe compute the value of $10^{0.3} \\approx 1.99526$:\n$$L_{A,total} = 10 \\left[ 8.8 + \\log_{10}(1 + 1.99526) \\right] = 10 \\left[ 8.8 + \\log_{10}(2.99526) \\right]$$\n$$\\log_{10}(2.99526) \\approx 0.476435$$\n$$L_{A,total} \\approx 10 [ 8.8 + 0.476435 ] = 10 [ 9.276435 ] = 92.76435$$\nThe problem requires the final numeric result to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $92.76435...$, which rounds to $92.76$.\nSo, the combined A-weighted level is $92.76 \\ \\mathrm{dB(A)}$.\n\nFinally, for the interpretation: The combined level of $92.76 \\ \\mathrm{dB(A)}$ is only $1.76 \\ \\mathrm{dB}$ higher than the level of the louder source alone ($91 \\ \\mathrm{dB(A)}$). This demonstrates the logarithmic nature of the decibel scale, where the total sound level is dominated by the loudest source. However, this seemingly small increase in decibels represents a significant increase in acoustic energy. An increase of $1.76 \\ \\mathrm{dB}$ corresponds to the total sound intensity being $10^{1.76/10} = 10^{0.176} \\approx 1.5$ times the intensity of the louder source. Under the equal-energy criterion, where every $3 \\ \\mathrm{dB}$ increase in level requires halving the permissible exposure time (PET), this $1.76 \\ \\mathrm{dB}$ increase necessitates a substantial reduction in the allowable exposure duration. Specifically, the PET is reduced by a factor of $2^{(\\Delta L/3)} = 2^{(1.76/3)} \\approx 2^{0.587} \\approx 1.5$. This means the safe exposure time for a worker is reduced by approximately one-third compared to the exposure from the $91 \\ \\mathrm{dB(A)}$ source alone, highlighting the increased risk of Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{92.76}$$", "id": "5052801"}, {"introduction": "An accurate sound level measurement is only half of the risk assessment; the duration of exposure is equally critical.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe total daily noise dose, $D_{total}$, is the sum of the partial doses from each individual noise exposure segment. A partial dose, $D_i$, is the ratio of the actual exposure duration, $T_i$, to the maximum permissible exposure duration, $T_p$, at that specific noise level, $L_i$.\n$$D_{total} = \\sum_i D_i = \\sum_i \\frac{T_i}{T_p(L_i)}$$\n\nThe key is to determine the permissible duration $T_p(L)$ for any given noise level $L$. The problem states that for every increase of $E_R = 3\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ above the criterion level $L_c = 85\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$, the allowable duration is halved. The reference duration at $L_c$ is $T_0 = 8\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\nLet $\\Delta L$ be the difference between the exposure level $L$ and the criterion level $L_c$, so $\\Delta L = L - L_c$. The number of $3\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ increments in this difference is $n = \\frac{\\Delta L}{E_R} = \\frac{L - L_c}{3}$.\n\nFor each of these $n$ increments, the duration is halved. Therefore, the permissible exposure duration $T_p(L)$ is given by:\n$$T_p(L) = T_0 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n = T_0 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{(L - L_c) / E_R}$$\nThis can be written using powers of $2$ as:\n$$T_p(L) = T_0 \\times 2^{-(L - L_c) / E_R}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the partial dose for each of the worker's exposure segments.\n\n**Segment 1: Exposure at $L_1 = 95\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$ for $T_1 = 2\\,\\mathrm{h}$**\n\nFirst, we calculate the permissible exposure duration, $T_{p1}$, at $L_1 = 95\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$.\nUsing the formula with $L_1 = 95\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$, $L_c = 85\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$, $T_0 = 8\\,\\mathrm{h}$, and $E_R = 3\\,\\mathrm{dB}$:\n$$T_{p1} = 8\\,\\mathrm{h} \\times 2^{-(95 - 85) / 3} = 8 \\times 2^{-10/3}\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\nThe partial dose for this segment, $D_1$, is:\n$$D_1 = \\frac{T_1}{T_{p1}} = \\frac{2\\,\\mathrm{h}}{8 \\times 2^{-10/3}\\,\\mathrm{h}} = \\frac{2}{8} \\times \\frac{1}{2^{-10/3}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 2^{10/3}$$\nUsing the properties of exponents ($ \\frac{1}{4} = 2^{-2} $):\n$$D_1 = 2^{-2} \\times 2^{10/3} = 2^{(10/3 - 2)} = 2^{(10/3 - 6/3)} = 2^{4/3}$$\n\n**Segment 2: Exposure at $L_2 = 88\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$ for $T_2 = 4\\,\\mathrm{h}$**\n\nNext, we calculate the permissible exposure duration, $T_{p2}$, at $L_2 = 88\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$.\nUsing the formula with $L_2 = 88\\,\\mathrm{dBA}$:\n$$T_{p2} = 8\\,\\mathrm{h} \\times 2^{-(88 - 85) / 3} = 8 \\times 2^{-3/3} = 8 \\times 2^{-1} = 8 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 4\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\nThe partial dose for this segment, $D_2$, is:\n$$D_2 = \\frac{T_2}{T_{p2}} = \\frac{4\\,\\mathrm{h}}{4\\,\\mathrm{h}} = 1$$\n\n**Total Daily Dose**\n\nThe total daily dose is the sum of the partial doses:\n$$D_{total} = D_1 + D_2 = 2^{4/3} + 1$$\nTo provide a numerical answer, we evaluate this expression.\n$$2^{4/3} = \\sqrt[3]{2^4} = \\sqrt[3]{16}$$\nThe value is approximately:\n$$2^{4/3} \\approx 2.51984209979$$\nTherefore, the total dose is:\n$$D_{total} \\approx 2.51984209979 + 1 = 3.51984209979$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$D_{total} \\approx 3.520$$\nThis is the total daily dose expressed as a dimensionless fraction relative to the criterion dose.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.520}$$", "id": "5052778"}, {"introduction": "Effective hearing conservation programs rely on active surveillance to detect the earliest signs of noise-induced hearing damage.
