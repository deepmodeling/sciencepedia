This method estimates the mean of the tolerance distribution (which, for a symmetric distribution, is the $50\\%$ point, or SNR-50) from the observed proportions of correct responses at different stimulus levels.\n\nLet's organize the data with SNRs in ascending order for clarity.\nThe SNR levels are $x_i \\in \\{0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25\\}$ dB.\nThe number of correct words out of $m=5$ are $n_i \\in \\{0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5\\}$.\nThe proportion correct at each level is $p_i = n_i / m$.\n- At $x_1=0$ dB, $p_1 = 0/5 = 0.0$.\n- At $x_2=5$ dB, $p_2 = 2/5 = 0.4$.\n- At $x_3=10$ dB, $p_3 = 3/5 = 0.6$.\n- At $x_4=15$ dB, $p_4 = 4/5 = 0.8$.\n- At $x_5=20$ dB, $p_5 = 5/5 = 1.0$.\n- At $x_6=25$ dB, $p_6 = 5/5 = 1.0$.\n\nThe step size between SNR levels is constant, $d=5$ dB. The Spearman-Kärber estimator for the mean threshold, $\\hat{\\mu}$, can be calculated as the weighted sum of the midpoints of the stimulus intervals, where the weights are the changes in probability across those intervals.\n$$ \\hat{\\mu} = \\sum_{i} x_{i}^{*} (\\Delta p_i) = \\sum_{i} \\frac{x_i + x_{i-1}}{2} (p_i - p_{i-1}) $$\nThe sum is over the intervals where the probability changes. We assume that at some level $x_0$ below $0$ dB, the proportion correct is $p_0=0$.\n\nThe changes in proportion correct ($\\Delta p_i$) occur between the tested levels:\n- Interval 1 ($0$ to $5$ dB): Midpoint $x_1^* = \\frac{0+5}{2} = 2.5$ dB.

Change in proportion $\\Delta p_5 = p(25) - p(20) = 1.0 - 1.0 = 0.0$.\n\nNow, we compute the listener's unaided SNR-50:\n$$ \\text{SNR-50}_{\\text{unaided}} = \\hat{\\mu} = (2.5)(0.4) + (7.5)(0.2) + (12.5)(0.2) + (17.5)(0.2) + (22.5)(0.0) $$\n$$ \\text{SNR-50}_{\\text{unaided}} = 1.0 + 1.5 + 2.5 + 3.5 + 0 = 8.5 \\text{ dB} $$\n\nNext, we determine the target aided SNR-50 required to meet the clinical goal. The goal is an aided SNR loss no greater than $3.0$ dB. We use the minimum required improvement, which corresponds to achieving this goal exactly.\n$$ \\text{SNR Loss}_{\\text{aided}} = 3.0 \\text{ dB} $$\nUsing the definition of SNR loss:\n$$ \\text{SNR Loss}_{\\text{aided}} = \\text{SNR-50}_{\\text{aided}} - \\text{SNR-50}_{\\text{normal}} $$\nWe are given $\\text{SNR-50}_{\\text{normal}} = 2.0$ dB.\n$$ 3.0 = \\text{SNR-50}_{\\text{aided}} - 2.0 $$\nSolving for the target aided SNR-50:\n$$ \\text{SNR-50}_{\\text{aided}} = 3.0 + 2.0 = 5.0 \\text{ dB} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the minimum required improvement, $I_{\\min}$.

A general form for such a function, mapping a variable $S$ to a scale of $0$ to $L$, is:\n$$g(S) = \\frac{L}{1 + e^{-k(S - S_0)}}$$\nwhere $L$ is the maximum value, $k$ is a positive constant determining the steepness of the curve, and $S_0$ is the value of $S$ at the inflection point (the midpoint of the vertical range).\n\n1.  **Determine the Maximum Value $L$**: The range of the $HHIE$ score is $[0, 100]$. The upper asymptote is specified as $g(S) \\to 100$ as $S \\to +\\infty$. This directly sets the maximum value $L = 100$.\n    $$g(S) = \\frac{100}{1 + e^{-k(S - S_0)}}$$\n\n2.  **Determine the Inflection Point $S_0$**: The function is symmetric about its inflection point, which occurs at $S = S_0$. At this point, the value of the function is half its maximum, i.e., $g(S_0) = L/2 = 100/2 = 50$. The mid-severity anchor states that $g(2) = 50$. By equating these, we find the inflection point:\n    $$g(S_0) = 50 \\implies g(2) = 50$$\n    Therefore, $S_0 = 2$. Substituting this into the function gives:\n    $$g(S) = \\frac{100}{1 + e^{-k(S - 2)}}$$\n\n3.  **Determine the Steepness Parameter $k$**: We use the remaining calibration anchor, the baseline anchor $g(0) = 5$, to solve for $k$.\n    $$g(0) = 5 = \\frac{100}{1 + e^{-k(0 - 2)}}$$\n    $$5 = \\frac{100}{1 + e^{2k}}$$\n    We now solve for $k$:\n    $$1 + e^{2k} = \\frac{100}{5} = 20$$\n    $$e^{2k} = 19$$\n    $$2k = \\ln(19)$$\n    $$k = \\frac{\\ln(19)}{2}$$\n    Since $\\ln(19) > 0$, we have $k > 0$, which is consistent with $g(S)$ being a strictly increasing function.\n\n4.  **Final Explicit Function**: Substituting the value of $k$ back into our equation for $g(S)$ yields the final mapping function:\n    $$g(S) = \\frac{100}{1 + e^{-\\frac{\\ln(19)}{2}(S - 2)}}$$\n    This expression can be simplified by using the identity $e^{\\ln(x)} = x$:\n    $$g(S) = \\frac{100}{1 + (e^{\\ln(19)})^{-\\frac{1}{2}(S - 2)}} = \\frac{100}{1 + 19^{-\\frac{S-2}{2}}} = \\frac{100}{1 + 19^{\\frac{2-S}{2}}}$$\n    This is the explicit function that satisfies all given properties and calibration anchors.\n\n**Application to Test Suite Cases**\n\nWe will now apply this model to each case in the test suite. For each case $(PTA, SNR, MoCA)$, we first calculate the normalized deficits, then the latent severity $S$, and finally the predicted $HHIE$ score using $g(S)$.\n\n**Case 1**: $(PTA=55, SNR=8, MoCA=24)$\n*   $z_{\\mathrm{PTA}} = \\dfrac{55 - 25}{15} = \\dfrac{30}{15} = 2.0$\n*   $z_{\\mathrm{SNR}} = \\dfrac{8 - 2}{4} = \\dfrac{6}{4} = 1.5$\n*   $z_{\\mathrm{cog}} = \\dfrac{26 - 24}{3} = \\dfrac{2}{3}$\n*   $S = 2.0 + 1.5 - \\dfrac{2}{3} = 3.5 - \\dfrac{2}{3} = \\dfrac{7}{2} - \\dfrac{2}{3} = \\dfrac{21 - 4}{6} = \\dfrac{17}{6} \\approx 2.833$\n*   $HHIE = g(\\frac{17}{6}) = \\dfrac{100}{1 + 19^{\\frac{2 - 17/6}{2}}} = \\dfrac{100}{1 + 19^{\\frac{(12-17)/6}{2}}} = \\dfrac{100}{1 + 19^{-5/12}} \\approx \\dfrac{100}{1 + 0.3228} \\approx 75.597$\n*   Rounded result: $76$.\n\n**Case 2**: $(PTA=20, SNR=1, MoCA=29)$\n*   $z_{\\mathrm{PTA}} = \\dfrac{20 - 25}{15} = \\dfrac{-5}{15} = -\\dfrac{1}{3}$\n*   $z_{\\mathrm{SNR}} = \\dfrac{1 - 2}{4} = \\dfrac{-1}{4} = -0.25$\n*   $z_{\\mathrm{cog}} = \\dfrac{26 - 29}{3} = \\dfrac{-3}{3} = -1.0$\n*   $S = -\\dfrac{1}{3} - \\dfrac{1}{4} - (-1) = 1 - \\dfrac{1}{3} - \\dfrac{1}{4} = \\dfrac{12 - 4 - 3}{12} = \\dfrac{5}{12} \\approx 0.417$\n*   $HHIE = g(\\frac{5}{12}) = \\dfrac{100}{1 + 19^{\\frac{2 - 5/12}{2}}} = \\dfrac{100}{1 + 19^{\\frac{(24-5)/12}{2}}} = \\dfrac{100}{1 + 19^{19/24}} \\approx \\dfrac{100}{1 + 10.355} \\approx 8.806$\n*   Rounded result: $9$.\n\n**Case 3**: $(PTA=80, SNR=12, MoCA=20)$\n*   $z_{\\mathrm{PTA}} = \\dfrac{80 - 25}{15} = \\dfrac{55}{15} = \\dfrac{11}{3}$\n*   $z_{\\mathrm{SNR}} = \\dfrac{12 - 2}{4} = \\dfrac{10}{4} = 2.5$\n*   $z_{\\mathrm{cog}} = \\dfrac{26 - 20}{3} = \\dfrac{6}{3} = 2.0$\n*   $S = \\dfrac{11}{3} + 2.5 - 2.0 = \\dfrac{11}{3} + 0.5 = \\dfrac{11}{3} + \\dfrac{1}{2} = \\dfrac{22 + 3}{6} = \\dfrac{25}{6} \\approx 4.167$\n*   $HHIE = g(\\frac{25}{6}) = \\dfrac{100}{1 + 19^{\\frac{2 - 25/6}{2}}} = \\dfrac{100}{1 + 19^{\\frac{(12-25)/6}{2}}} = \\dfrac{100}{1 + 19^{-13/12}} \\approx \\dfrac{100}{1 + 0.0441} \\approx 95.776$\n*   Rounded result: $96$.\n\n**Case 4**: $(PTA=25, SNR=0, MoCA=26)$\n*   $z_{\\mathrm{PTA}} = \\dfrac{25 - 25}{15} = 0.0$\n*   $z_{\\mathrm{SNR}} = \\dfrac{0 - 2}{4} = -0.5$\n*   $z_{\\mathrm{cog}} = \\dfrac{26 - 26}{3} = 0.0$\n*   $S = 0.0 + (-0.5) - 0.0 = -0.5$\n*   $HHIE = g(-0.5) = \\dfrac{100}{1 + 19^{\\frac{2 - (-0.5)}{2}}} = \\dfrac{100}{1 + 19^{\\frac{2.5}{2}}} = \\dfrac{100}{1 + 19^{1.25}} \\approx \\dfrac{100}{1 + 39.667} \\approx 2.459$\n*   Rounded result: $2$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes predicted Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE)\n    scores based on a psychometric model incorporating PTA, SNR loss, and\n    MoCA cognitive scores.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test suite cases as tuples of (PTA, SNR, MoCA).\n    # PTA is in dB HL, SNR is in dB, and MoCA is in points.\n    test_cases = [\n        (55, 8, 24),   # Case 1\n        (20, 1, 29),   # Case 2\n        (80, 12, 20),  # Case 3\n        (25, 0, 26),   # Case 4\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # Memoize constants for clarity and efficiency\n    PTA_NORMAL = 25.0\n    PTA_SCALE = 15.0\n    SNR_NORMAL = 2.0\n    SNR_SCALE = 4.0\n    MOCA_NORMAL = 26.0\n    MOCA_SCALE = 3.0\n    \n    # Parameters for the derived mapping function g(S)\n    # g(S) = 100 / (1 + 19**((2-S)/2))\n    G_L = 100.0  # Maximum value (asymptote)\n    G_BASE = 19.0 # Base of the exponential term, from exp(2k) = 19\n    G_S0 = 2.0    # Inflection point\n    G_EXP_SCALE = 2.0 # Denominator in exponent\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        pta, snr, moca = case\n\n        # Step 1: Calculate normalized deficits\n        z_pta = (pta - PTA_NORMAL) / PTA_SCALE\n        z_snr = (snr - SNR_NORMAL) / SNR_SCALE\n        z_cog = (MOCA_NORMAL - moca) / MOCA_SCALE\n\n        # Step 2: Calculate composite latent severity S\n        S = z_pta + z_snr - z_cog\n\n        # Step 3: Map latent severity S to HHIE total score using the derived function g(S)\n        exponent = (G_S0 - S) / G_EXP_SCALE\n        hhie_predicted = G_L / (1.0 + G_BASE**exponent)\n\n        # Step 4: Round the result to the nearest integer and append to results list\n        results.append(int(np.round(hhie_predicted)))\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "5062651"}]}
