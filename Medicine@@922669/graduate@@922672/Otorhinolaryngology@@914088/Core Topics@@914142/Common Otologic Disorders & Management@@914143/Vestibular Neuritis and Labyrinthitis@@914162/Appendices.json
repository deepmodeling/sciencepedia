The provided foundational principle is that in an acute unilateral peripheral vestibulopathy, the fast-beating component of the nystagmus points away from the side of the pathological lesion. This is because the vestibular nuclei on the healthy side have a higher resting firing rate than the lesioned side, driving the eyes slowly toward the lesioned side (slow phase). The central nervous system generates a rapid corrective saccade, a \"fast phase,\" back toward the midline and past it, in the direction opposite to the slow phase.\n\n-   Observed fast phase direction: Right.\n-   Principle: Fast phase is directed *away* from the lesion.\n-   Therefore, the lesion must be on the **left** side.\n\nThe problem defines a sign variable $s$ to encode the lesion side:\n-   $s = +1$ for a right-sided lesion.\n-   $s = -1$ for a left-sided lesion.\n\nSince the lesion is on the left side, the value of the sign variable is:\n$$s = -1$$\n\n**3) Calculation of the Final Signed Scalar, $S$**\n\nThe final answer is the signed scalar $S$, defined as the product of the sign variable $s$ and the VOR gain $g$.\n$$S = s \\cdot g$$\nSubstituting the values we calculated:\n-   $s = -1$\n-   $g = 0.6$\n\n$$S = (-1) \\cdot (0.6) = -0.6$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

It provides all necessary data and definitions to compute a unique, meaningful solution according to established principles in clinical vestibular science. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of signed canal paresis based on slow-phase velocity (SPV) measurements from a bithermal caloric test. The provided definition states that canal paresis quantifies the interaural asymmetry in total caloric responsiveness, normalized by the overall response magnitude. This corresponds to the standard clinical formula, often referred to as Jongkees' formula.\n\nLet the magnitudes of the slow-phase velocities be denoted as follows:\n- $R_C$: Right ear, cold irrigation\n- $R_W$: Right ear, warm irrigation\n- $L_C$: Left ear, cold irrigation\n- $L_W$: Left ear, warm irrigation\n\nThe given values are:\n- $R_C = 2~^{\\circ}/\\mathrm{s}$\n- $R_W = 8~^{\\circ}/\\mathrm{s}$\n- $L_C = 20~^{\\circ}/\\mathrm{s}$\n- $L_W = 24~^{\\circ}/\\mathrm{s}$\n\nThe total caloric response for the right ear is the sum of the responses to cold and warm stimuli in that ear:\n$$ \\text{Total Right Response} = R_C + R_W $$\nThe total caloric response for the left ear is similarly defined:\n$$ \\text{Total Left Response} = L_C + L_W $$\nThe interaural asymmetry is the difference between the total responses of the two ears. The overall response magnitude is the sum of all four measured responses.\n\nThe formula for canal paresis, $CP$, is the ratio of the asymmetry to the total response. The problem specifies a sign convention where a positive value indicates relative hypofunction (paresis) of the right ear. A right ear paresis occurs when the total response of the right ear is less than that of the left ear.

The labyrinth and the left inferior vestibular nerve show no enhancement.\n*   **Diagnostic Tests:**\n    *   Video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) is performed, reporting canal-specific gains defined as the ratio $g = \\omega_{e}/\\omega_{h}$, where $\\omega_{e}$ is eye angular velocity and $\\omega_{h}$ is head angular velocity.

The division of the vestibular nerve, the specific sensory organs innervated by each branch, and the principles of diagnostic tests like vHIT and VEMP are all standard, scientifically-validated concepts. The clinical presentation described is a classic syndrome (superior vestibular neuritis). The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a precise localization of a lesion (the left superior vestibular nerve) and asks for the expected functional deficits as measured by specific, well-defined tests. This setup allows for a unique, stable, and meaningful solution based on known anatomical pathways.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is objective and clinical. The findings, such as \"enhancement confined to the left superior vestibular nerve,\" are described as factual data. The question requires a logical deduction from these facts, not a subjective opinion.\n4.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The problem is self-contained and consistent. The specified lesion is sufficient to derive the consequences. The clinical sign of right-beating nystagmus is consistent with a left-sided peripheral vestibular hypofunction, which aligns with the MRI finding. The normal audiometry correctly differentiates the condition from pathologies affecting the cochlea or the entire labyrinth (labyrinthitis).\n5.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The scenario is clinically realistic and represents a common presentation of vestibular neuritis.\n6.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured:** The terminology is standard and unambiguous within the field.\n7.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological:** The problem requires specific, non-trivial knowledge of neuroanatomy to solve correctly.\n8.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability:** The predictions can be, and are, routinely verified in clinical practice.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires applying knowledge of the vestibular system's neuroanatomy to predict the functional consequences of a lesion localized to the superior vestibular nerve.\n\n**1. Anatomical Innervation of the Vestibular Labyrinth:**\nThe vestibular portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve $VIII$) bifurcates into the superior and inferior vestibular nerves. Each nerve innervates specific sensory end-organs within the vestibular labyrinth.\n\n*   The **superior vestibular nerve** innervates:\n    *   The crista ampullaris of the **anterior semicircular canal**.\n    *   The crista ampullaris of the **horizontal (lateral) semicircular canal**.\n    *   The macula of the **utricle**.\n    *   A small portion of the saccular macula.\n\n*   The **inferior vestibular nerve** innervates:\n    *   The crista ampullaris of the **posterior semicircular canal**.\n    *   The macula of the **saccule**.\n\n**2. Pathophysiological Consequences of the Lesion:**\nThe problem states there is a lesion (inflammation, indicated by gadolinium enhancement) confined to the **left superior vestibular nerve**. The inferior vestibular nerve is spared. Therefore, we expect dysfunction of the sensory organs innervated by the left superior nerve, while those innervated by the left inferior nerve should function normally.\n\n**3. Predicted vHIT Findings:**\nThe vHIT measures the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain for each semicircular canal individually. The gain, $g = \\omega_{e}/\\omega_{h}$, quantifies how well eye velocity compensates for head velocity. A normal gain is approximately $1.0$. A lesion affecting the nerve from a canal will result in a reduced gain and corrective saccades when the head is impulsively rotated towards the side of that canal.\n\n*   **Left Horizontal Canal:** Innervated by the left superior vestibular nerve. A lesion here will disrupt the VOR pathway. Thus, the gain for the left horizontal canal, $g_{H}$, will be **reduced**.\n*   **Left Anterior Canal:** Innervated by the left superior vestibular nerve. A lesion here will disrupt the VOR pathway. Thus, the gain for the left anterior canal, $g_{A}$, will be **reduced**.\n*   **Left Posterior Canal:** Innervated by the left inferior vestibular nerve, which is spared. The VOR pathway for this canal should be intact. Thus, the gain for the left posterior canal, $g_{P}$, will be **normal**.\n\nIn summary, the vHIT will show reduced gains for the ipsilateral (left) horizontal and anterior canals.\n\n**4. Predicted VEMP Findings:**\nVEMPs are myogenic responses to auditory or vibratory stimuli, mediated by the otolith organs.\n\n*   **Cervical VEMP (cVEMP):** This test primarily assesses the integrity of the saccule and the inferior vestibular nerve. The pathway is: Saccule $\\rightarrow$ Inferior Vestibular Nerve $\\rightarrow$ Vestibular Nuclei $\\rightarrow$ Medial Vestibulospinal Tract $\\rightarrow$ Sternocleidomastoid Muscle. Since the lesion is in the superior nerve and the saccule/inferior nerve are spared, the cVEMP response should be present and normal. Therefore, the **cVEMP is spared**.\n*   **Ocular VEMP (oVEMP):** This test primarily assesses the integrity of the utricle and the superior vestibular nerve. The pathway is: Utricle $\\rightarrow$ Superior Vestibular Nerve $\\rightarrow$ Vestibular Nuclei $\\rightarrow$ Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus $\\rightarrow$ Contralateral Oculomotor Nucleus $\\rightarrow$ Inferior Oblique Muscle. Since the lesion affects the left superior vestibular nerve, which innervates the utricle, the oVEMP pathway is disrupted. The oVEMP response on the affected side will be reduced or absent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on a lesion of the left superior vestibular nerve, the predicted findings are:\n*   Reduced vHIT gains for the left horizontal ($g_{H}$) and left anterior ($g_{A}$) canals.\n*   Spared (normal) cVEMP response.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Reduced ipsilateral horizontal $g_{H}$ and anterior $g_{A}$ canal vHIT gains; cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) spared.**\n    *   This option correctly identifies that the superior vestibular nerve innervates the horizontal and anterior canals, leading to reduced gains ($g_{H}$ and $g_{A}$). It also correctly identifies that the cVEMP pathway, which relies on the saccule and the inferior vestibular nerve, would be intact. This perfectly matches the derived predictions.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Reduced ipsilateral posterior $g_{P}$ and horizontal $g_{H}$ canal vHIT gains; ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP) spared.**\n    *   The prediction of reduced posterior canal gain ($g_{P}$) is incorrect; the posterior canal is innervated by the spared inferior vestibular nerve. The prediction that the oVEMP would be spared is also incorrect; the oVEMP relies on the utricle and the superior vestibular nerve, which is the site of the lesion.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Reduced ipsilateral anterior $g_{A}$ canal vHIT gain only; ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP) spared.**\n    *   This prediction is incomplete. While the anterior canal gain ($g_{A}$) would be reduced, the horizontal canal gain ($g_{H}$) would also be reduced, as both are innervated by the superior vestibular nerve. The prediction that the oVEMP would be spared is also incorrect for the reason stated above.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Reduced all three canal vHIT gains; cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) spared.**\n    *   The prediction of reduced gain for all three canals is incorrect. This pattern would imply a total vestibular nerve lesion or labyrinthitis, not a lesion confined to the superior nerve. The posterior canal gain ($g_{P}$) should be normal.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Reduced ipsilateral posterior $g_{P}$ canal vHIT gain only; cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) spared.**\n    *   The prediction of reduced posterior canal gain ($g_{P}$) is incorrect. This finding would be characteristic of an inferior vestibular neuritis. Furthermore, in an inferior vestibular neuritis, the cVEMP (mediated by the inferior nerve) would be expected to be abnormal, not spared, making the option internally inconsistent with the pathophysiology it implies.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5084033"}]}
