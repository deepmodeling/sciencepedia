Constructing the Mathematical Definition of Pure-Tone Average (PTA)**\n\nWe begin from the first principles specified. A behavioral hearing threshold, $L$, is measured in decibels Hearing Level (dB HL). This is a logarithmic scale defined relative to the average threshold of a normal-hearing population. A higher dB HL value signifies a greater amount of sound intensity required for detection, and thus, a greater degree of hearing loss. Let the sound intensity required for a patient to reach threshold be $I_{patient}$ and the reference intensity for normal hearing be $I_{normal}$ at a given frequency. The hearing level $L$ is proportional to the logarithm of their ratio, specifically $L = 10 \\log_{10}(I_{patient}/I_{normal})$.\n\nThe problem states that the long-term average speech spectrum concentrates its acoustic power and key informational content (formants) within the approximate range of $0.5\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$ to $2\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$. The objective is to formulate a single, clinically practical metric that estimates a patient's functional hearing ability for speech, based on discrete frequency thresholds within this critical band.\n\nGiven that the hearing thresholds $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$ represent the patient's auditory sensitivity at three key frequencies for speech, a summary statistic is needed to represent the overall hearing status across this range. The most straightforward and clinically practical method to combine these values into a single representative number is the arithmetic mean.\n\nLet the PTA be the pure-tone average. The mathematical definition is constructed as the arithmetic mean of the hearing level values at the specified frequencies of $0.5\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$, $1\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$, and $2\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$:\n$$\nPTA = \\frac{L_{0.5\\mathrm{kHz}} + L_{1\\mathrm{kHz}} + L_{2\\mathrm{kHz}}}{3}\n$$\nIn our notation, this is:\n$$\nPTA = \\frac{L_1 + L_2 + L_3}{3}\n$$\nThis arithmetic average on a logarithmic (decibel) scale corresponds to the geometric mean of the underlying physical intensity ratios. This is a reasonable approach because perception of loudness is itself approximately logarithmic, meaning that equal steps on the dB scale correspond to roughly equal steps in perceived loudness change. Thus, the arithmetic mean of the dB HL values provides a perceptually relevant and simple-to-calculate index of overall speech audibility.\n\n**2. Explanation for the Choice of Frequencies ($0.5$, $1$, and $2\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$)**\n\nThe choice of these specific three frequencies—$0.5\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$, $1\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$, and $2\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$—is based on fundamental principles of acoustic phonetics and psychoacoustics:\n\n- **Energy Distribution in Speech**: The majority of the acoustic power in human speech is contained in the lower frequencies, particularly below $1\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$. The first formant (F1) of most vowels, which contains a great deal of the energy, typically lies in the $250\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ to $750\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ range. The $500\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ ($0.5\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$) frequency is therefore a crucial representative for the audibility of speech loudness and the fundamental quality of vowels.\n\n- **Speech Intelligibility**: While higher frequencies (above $2\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$) are critical for the perception of certain consonants (e.g., fricatives like /s/), the mid-frequency range from $1\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$ to $2\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$ is vital for speech intelligibility. This range contains the second formant (F2) for most vowels and provides critical cues for distinguishing between different vowels and consonants. The combination of the first two formants is the primary determinant of vowel identity. Therefore, hearing acuity at $1\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$ and $2\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$ is directly related to the ability to understand, not just detect, speech. The region on an audiogram containing the critical frequencies and intensities for speech sounds is often termed the \"speech banana,\" and these three frequencies lie in its heart.\n\n- **Cochlear Place-Frequency Mapping (Tonotopy)**: The cochlea processes sound by frequency along the length of the basilar membrane, from high frequencies at the base to low frequencies at the apex. The region that responds to the $0.5\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$ to $2\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$ band is a significant and central portion of the sensory organ. Elevated thresholds in this range indicate dysfunction of the hair cells in this critical region, directly correlating with an impaired ability to process the core components of the speech signal.\n\nIn summary, the $0.5$, $1$, and $2\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$ frequencies are chosen because they collectively represent the band that contains most of the energy and the most salient intelligibility cues (vowel formants) of typical spoken language.\n\n**3.

The unremarkable otoscopy and Type A tympanograms clearly rule out a conductive pathology, focusing the problem on the sensorineural auditory system. The combination of results from different tests presents a complex but solvable puzzle. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid** and can be solved as stated.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to determine the pathophysiology that best explains the comprehensive set of audiological findings in this case of SSNHL.\n\n1.  **Initial Assessment**: The patient has an acute, unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Normal otoscopy and Type $A$ tympanometry confirm that the pathology is not in the outer or middle ear; it is sensorineural (i.e., within the cochlea or auditory nerve/brainstem). The hearing loss is a sloping configuration, with near-normal hearing at low frequencies ($250\\text{–}500\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$) and severe loss at high frequencies ($1\\text{–}8\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$).\n\n2.  **Analysis of OAEs**: DPOAEs are absent from $1\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ to $8\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$. According to Principle 1, OAEs are generated by the electromotility of outer hair cells (OHCs). Their absence is a direct sign of significant OHC dysfunction or death in the middle and basal turns of the cochlea, which correspond to the mid-to-high frequency range. This finding is consistent with the audiometric thresholds showing moderate to severe hearing loss ($40\\text{–}85\\,\\mathrm{dB\\ HL}$) in this range, as OHCs provide the cochlear amplification necessary for sensitive hearing.\n\n3.  **Analysis of ABR**:\n    *   **Click ABR**: A click stimulus evokes a response dominated by the high-frequency ($2\\text{–}4\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$) region of the cochlea. Given the severe hearing loss in this region, a \"small wave $I$\" is expected due to reduced neural contribution. A \"preserved wave $V$\" relative to a diminished wave $I$ (implying an increased wave V/I amplitude ratio) points towards a cochlear source of the hearing loss with central gain compensation, rather than a retrocochlear lesion where wave $V$ is typically delayed or absent.\n    *   **Tone-Burst ABR at $500\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$**: This test is crucial as it probes a frequency region where the hearing threshold is near-normal ($20\\,\\mathrm{dB\\ HL}$). The stimulus is delivered at $80\\,\\mathrm{dB\\ nHL}$, a high suprathreshold level. Despite the near-normal threshold, the wave $I$ amplitude ($0.05\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V}$) is severely reduced, being only one-third of the amplitude in the healthy contralateral ear ($0.15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{V}$). According to Principles 2 and 3, wave $I$ reflects the synchronous firing of the auditory nerve. A disproportionately small wave $I$ at suprathreshold levels, in the presence of good thresholds, is the cardinal sign of **cochlear synaptopathy**—the loss or dysfunction of the ribbon synapses connecting IHCs to auditory nerve fibers. It indicates that while the IHCs may be healthy enough to detect sound (preserving thresholds), the transmission of this signal to the auditory nerve is degraded in terms of synchrony and/or the number of responding fibers.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Speech-in-Noise Testing**: The QuickSIN test reveals a large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss of $9\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. Normal-hearing young adults typically have an SNR loss of $0\\text{–}3\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. An elevated SNR loss, especially to this degree, is a well-established functional correlate of cochlear synaptopathy or neural degradation. The ability to understand speech in noisy backgrounds relies on precise temporal encoding by a full complement of auditory nerve fibers, particularly the high-threshold fibers, which are thought to be most vulnerable in synaptopathy. This result strongly corroborates the ABR finding.\n\n5.  **Synthesis**: The evidence points to a multi-component cochlear pathology. The absent DPOAEs and high-frequency hearing loss indicate widespread OHC damage. The disproportionately small ABR wave $I$ at $500\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ and the profound speech-in-noise deficit indicate cochlear synaptopathy. The viral prodrome (URTI) is a plausible trigger for an inflammatory process (cochleitis) that could damage both OHCs and IHC-nerve synapses.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Pure outer hair cell dysfunction confined to the basal turn due to ischemia, with no inner hair cell or synaptic involvement.**\n    This option is insufficient. While it explains the high-frequency hearing loss and absent high-frequency DPOAEs, it completely fails to account for the key findings of a disproportionately small ABR wave $I$ at $500\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ and the severe $9\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ speech-in-noise deficit, which are markers of synaptic/neural dysfunction (Principle 3). **Incorrect**.\n*   **B. Conductive hearing loss due to middle ear effusion, causing absent otoacoustic emissions and reduced ABR wave $I$ amplitude.**\n    This is definitively ruled out by the \"unremarkable\" otoscopy and \"Type $A$\" tympanometry, which indicate a normal middle ear. **Incorrect**.\n*   **C. Combined outer hair cell dysfunction (abolishing otoacoustic emissions) with cochlear synaptopathy at inner hair cell–auditory nerve ribbon synapses, producing disproportionately reduced ABR wave $I$ amplitude at low-frequency tone bursts and speech-in-noise deficits.**\n    This option provides a comprehensive explanation for all the presented data. The OHC dysfunction explains the absent DPOAEs and a significant portion of the hearing loss. The cochlear synaptopathy precisely explains the paradoxical combination of near-normal low-frequency thresholds with a severely reduced suprathreshold ABR wave $I$ amplitude and the poor speech-in-noise performance. This combined pathology is the most consistent and complete explanation. **Correct**.\n*   **D. Retrocochlear lesion at the superior olivary complex selectively attenuating ABR wave $I$ while preserving otoacoustic emissions.**\n    This option is factually incorrect on multiple accounts. First, a lesion at the superior olivary complex (SOC) would affect ABR waves III and later, not selectively wave $I$, which is generated by the distal auditory nerve. Second, the problem states that DPOAEs are *absent*, contradicting the \"preserving otoacoustic emissions\" claim. Third, this diagnosis is inconsistent with the ABR pattern of a small wave I and preserved wave V, which is characteristic of cochlear pathology. **Incorrect**.\n*   **E. Endolymphatic hydrops localized to the apical cochlea causing fluctuating low-frequency hearing loss, explaining absent otoacoustic emissions despite near-normal low-frequency thresholds and reduced ABR wave $I$ amplitude.**\n    This diagnosis is inconsistent with the clinical presentation. The patient has a *sudden*, non-fluctuating loss that is most severe in the *high* frequencies, with no vestibular symptoms. Apical hydrops would cause low-frequency fluctuating loss. Furthermore, apical hydrops does not explain the absent DPOAEs in the $1\\text{–}8\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ range, which originate from the non-apical regions of the cochlea. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "5073982"}]}
