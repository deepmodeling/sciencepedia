A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe task is to determine if a clinically significant ototoxic change has occurred by applying the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) criteria to the provided audiometric data. The decision is to be encoded in a binary variable $D$.\n\nLet the ordered set of test frequencies in $\\mathrm{kHz}$ be denoted by $F = \\{f_1, f_2, ..., f_9\\}$, where:\n$$ F = \\{0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12\\} $$\nThe corresponding baseline thresholds in dB HL are given by the vector $T_{base}$:\n$$ T_{base} = \\{10, 10, 15, 15, 15, 20, 20, 25, 30\\} $$\nThe post-third-cycle thresholds in dB HL are given by the vector $T_{post}$:\n$$ T_{post} = \\{10, 15, 25, 30, 20, 35, 45, 40, 55\\} $$\n\nThe ASHA (1994, reaffirmed 2009) criteria for a significant ototoxic change, confirmed by retest, are met if at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:\n1.  A worsening (increase) of $\\ge 20$ dB in the hearing threshold at any one test frequency.\n2.  A worsening (increase) of $\\ge 10$ dB in the hearing threshold at any two adjacent test frequencies.\n3.  Loss of response (no measurable threshold at the output limits of the audiometer) at three consecutive frequencies where responses were previously obtained.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the threshold shift, $\\Delta T_i$, for each frequency $f_i$. The shift is defined as the difference between the post-cycle threshold and the baseline threshold:\n$$ \\Delta T_i = T_{post,i} - T_{base,i} $$\nWe compute this for each of the $9$ frequencies:\n- At $f_1 = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$: $\\Delta T_1 = 10 - 10 = 0$ dB\n- At $f_2 = 1\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$: $\\Delta T_2 = 15 - 10 = 5$ dB\n- At $f_3 = 2\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$: $\\Delta T_3 = 25 - 15 = 10$ dB\n- At $f_4 = 3\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$: $\\Delta T_4 = 30 - 15 = 15$ dB\n- At $f_5 = 4\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$: $\\Delta T_5 = 20 - 15 = 5$ dB\n- At $f_6 = 6\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$: $\\Delta T_6 = 35 - 20 = 15$ dB\n- At $f_7 = 8\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$: $\\Delta T_7 = 45 - 20 = 25$ dB\n- At $f_8 = 10\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$: $\\Delta T_8 = 40 - 25 = 15$ dB\n- At $f_9 = 12\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$: $\\Delta T_9 = 55 - 30 = 25$ dB\n\nThe vector of threshold shifts is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta T = \\{0, 5, 10, 15, 5, 15, 25, 15, 25\\} $$\n\nNow, we evaluate the ASHA criteria using this set of shifts.\n\n**Evaluation of Criterion 1:** We check if any single shift $\\Delta T_i$ is greater than or equal to $20$ dB.\n$$ \\exists i \\in \\{1, ..., 9\\} \\text{ such that } \\Delta T_i \\ge 20 \\text{ dB?} $$\nUpon inspection of the $\\Delta T$ vector, we find:\n- $\\Delta T_7 = 25$ dB at $f_7 = 8\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$. Since $25 \\ge 20$, this criterion is met.\n- $\\Delta T_9 = 25$ dB at $f_9 = 12\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$. Since $25 \\ge 20$, this criterion is also met.\nThe presence of just one such shift is sufficient. Therefore, ASHA Criterion 1 is satisfied.\n\n**Evaluation of Criterion 2:** We check for any pair of adjacent frequencies $(f_i, f_{i+1})$ where the shifts at both frequencies are greater than or equal to $10$ dB. Adjacency is determined by the order in the given frequency set.\n$$ \\exists i \\in \\{1, ..., 8\\} \\text{ such that } (\\Delta T_i \\ge 10 \\text{ dB}) \\land (\\Delta T_{i+1} \\ge 10 \\text{ dB})? $$\nWe examine adjacent pairs in the $\\Delta T$ vector $\\{0, 5, 10, 15, 5, 15, 25, 15, 25\\}$:\n- Pair $(\\Delta T_3, \\Delta T_4) = (10, 15)$. At frequencies $f_3=2\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ and $f_4=3\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$, both shifts are $\\ge 10$ dB. This pair satisfies the criterion.\n- Pair $(\\Delta T_6, \\Delta T_7) = (15, 25)$. At frequencies $f_6=6\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ and $f_7=8\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$, both shifts are $\\ge 10$ dB. This pair also satisfies the criterion.\n- Pair $(\\Delta T_7, \\Delta T_8) = (25, 15)$. At frequencies $f_7=8\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ and $f_8=10\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$, both shifts are $\\ge 10$ dB. This pair also satisfies the criterion.\n- Pair $(\\Delta T_8, \\Delta T_9) = (15, 25)$. At frequencies $f_8=10\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ and $f_9=12\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$, both shifts are $\\ge 10$ dB. This pair also satisfies the criterion.\nTherefore, ASHA Criterion 2 is also satisfied.\n\n**Evaluation of Criterion 3:** We check for a loss of response. The problem data provides finite integer values for all post-cycle thresholds, which implies that a response was obtained at all test frequencies. There is no instance of \"no response\". Therefore, ASHA Criterion 3 is not met.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nA clinically significant ototoxic change is declared if at least one of the ASHA criteria is met. In this case, both Criterion 1 and Criterion 2 have been met. The satisfaction of even a single criterion is sufficient to confirm ototoxicity.\n- Criterion 1 was met due to a $\\ge 20$ dB shift at $8\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ and $12\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$.\n- Criterion 2 was met at multiple adjacent frequency pairs.\n\nTherefore, a clinically significant ototoxic change has occurred. The decision variable $D$, which is $1$ if a change is present and $0$ otherwise, must be set to $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "5058048"}, {"introduction": "Effective management of ototoxicity hinges on its detection at the earliest, subclinical stage, often before the patient notices a change or it appears on a standard audiogram.

The mechanism of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity, characterized by initial damage to outer hair cells in the basal (high-frequency) region of the cochlea, is a well-documented scientific fact. The use of DPOAEs and ultra-high-frequency audiometry for early detection of ototoxicity is standard clinical practice. The relationship between OHC function, DPOAEs, and PTA is described accurately.\n\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed.

The provided fundamental principles serve as the axioms for interpreting the data. A unique and logical conclusion regarding the patient's status and the appropriate course of action can be derived.\n\n- **Objective:** The language is clinical, precise, and objective. It avoids ambiguity and subjectivity.

It is a valid problem for which a solution can be derived.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe patient is receiving cisplatin, a known ototoxic agent. The core task is to interpret a set of audiological findings in this context.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Physiological Data:** The primary finding is an approximate $8$ $\\mathrm{dB}$ reduction in DPOAE amplitudes in the ultra-high-frequency range ($f_{2}$ from $10$ to $12$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$). According to Fundamental Basis 2, DPOAEs are generated by healthy outer hair cells (OHCs). A reduction in DPOAE amplitude directly signifies a reduction in OHC function, or OHC injury, at the cochlear location corresponding to the primary frequencies.\n\n2.  **Correlate with Cochlear Tonotopy:** According to Fundamental Basis 1, the basal region of the cochlea is responsible for processing high frequencies. The observed OHC dysfunction at $10$–$12$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$ thus localizes the injury to the basal turn of the cochlea.\n\n3.  **Integrate with Known Ototoxicity Patterns:** Fundamental Basis 3 states that platinum agents like cisplatin preferentially damage basal OHCs first. The observed pattern of OHC dysfunction located in the high-frequency (basal) region is the classic signature of early cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.\n\n4.  **Contrast Physiological and Behavioral Data:** While the physiological measure (DPOAE) shows a clear change, the behavioral measure (PTA) remains normal up to its tested limit of $8$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$. This discrepancy is explained by Fundamental Basis 3, which notes that objective physiologic changes (like DPOAE reduction) often precede behavioral threshold shifts on PTA. This means the damage is present but has not yet become severe enough to affect the patient's ability to hear pure tones at a clinical-threshold level within the standard audiometric range. This stage is defined as **subclinical** ototoxicity.\n\n5.  **Rule Out Confounding Factors:** The problem statement systematically excludes alternative explanations.\n    - Middle-ear dysfunction (conductive hearing loss) is ruled out by \"normal middle-ear pressure and compliance\" on tympanometry.\n    - Measurement error is ruled out by the statements that \"Middle-ear status and probe fit are verified\" and the \"Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) ... remains adequate for interpretation.\" A significant drop with good SNR confirms the change is physiological, not an artifact.\n\n6.  **Synthesize and Formulate Action Plan:** The collective evidence points unequivocally to early, subclinical ototoxic injury to the basal OHCs caused by cisplatin. This is a critical finding, as it is an early warning of potentially permanent and debilitating hearing loss. It is not benign variability, especially given the context of approaching a cumulative toxic dose. The appropriate clinical response is:\n    - **Acknowledge the finding:** Recognize this as a significant event.\n    - **Intensify monitoring:** To track the progression of damage, more frequent and targeted monitoring is required. This should include the tests that detected the change (DPOAEs) and behavioral tests in the affected frequency range (ultra-high-frequency audiometry, which tests above $8$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$).\n    - **Communicate with the care team:** The oncologist must be informed immediately. This allows for a collaborative discussion about the risks and benefits of continuing the current regimen versus modifying it (e.g., dose reduction, changing agents, adding otoprotective agents if applicable/available). This decision must balance cancer treatment efficacy against the quality-of-life impact of permanent hearing loss.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Early, subclinical basal outer hair cell dysfunction consistent with initial ototoxic injury; intensify monitoring with serial ultra-high-frequency audiometry and DPOAE, review cumulative dose and co-risk factors, and promptly discuss potential regimen modification with the oncology team.**\nThis option perfectly aligns with the derived conclusion. It correctly identifies the condition as early, subclinical OHC dysfunction localized to the basal cochlea, consistent with ototoxicity. The recommended actions—intensified monitoring with the most sensitive tools for the affected region (UHF audiometry and DPOAE), reviewing risk factors, and urgent interdisciplinary communication with oncology—represent the standard of care for managing ototoxicity.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Conductive hearing loss due to middle-ear effusion; proceed with tympanostomy tube placement and defer further ototoxicity monitoring.**\nThis option diagnoses a conductive hearing loss. This is directly contradicted by the given data that \"tympanometry shows normal middle-ear pressure and compliance,\" which rules out significant middle-ear effusion. The recommended action is therefore medically unwarranted.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Central auditory processing disorder; initiate auditory training and maintain the current chemotherapy plan without change.**\nThis option attributes the issue to the central auditory system. However, a reduction in DPOAE amplitude is a definitive sign of peripheral (cochlear) OHC dysfunction, not a central disorder. Maintaining the chemotherapy plan without change would ignore a significant sign of progressive, permanent cochlear damage.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Established clinical sensorineural hearing loss; fit immediate bilateral hearing aids and discontinue further physiologic monitoring.**\nThis option mischaracterizes the hearing loss as \"established clinical.\" It is subclinical, as the PTA in the standard frequency range ($0.25$ to $8$ $\\mathrm{kHz}$) is still normal. Hearing aids are not indicated at this stage. Discontinuing physiologic monitoring would be negligent, as it is the only way to track the progression of the subclinical damage.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Benign test-retest variability; no change in monitoring frequency and reassess only if PTA thresholds exceed $25$ $\\mathrm{dB}$ hearing level at two adjacent frequencies.**\nThis option dismisses a significant finding. An $8$ $\\mathrm{dB}$ drop in DPOAE amplitude is a large change, and in the context of cisplatin administration, it is highly indicative of ototoxicity, not random variability. Waiting for PTA thresholds to worsen would mean allowing significant, irreversible damage to occur before taking any action, which defeats the purpose of early monitoring.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5057982"}, {"introduction": "Ototoxic agents can damage not only the cochlea but also the vestibular system, leading to debilitating imbalance and oscillopsia.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe unilateral weakness (UW), also known as Jongkees' formula, quantifies the percentage difference in function between the right and left peripheral vestibular systems. It is calculated by taking the absolute difference between the sum of the responses from the right ear and the sum of the responses from the left ear, and normalizing this difference by the total response from all four irrigations.\n\nThe formula is given by:\n$$\nUW = \\frac{|(V_{\\text{RW}} + V_{\\text{RC}}) - (V_{\\text{LW}} + V_{\\text{LC}})|}{V_{\\text{RW}} + V_{\\text{RC}} + V_{\\text{LW}} + V_{\\text{LC}}}\n$$\nwhere the variables represent the maximal slow-phase velocities for the Right Warm ($V_{\\text{RW}}$), Right Cold ($V_{\\text{RC}}$), Left Warm ($V_{\\text{LW}}$), and Left Cold ($V_{\\text{LC}}$) caloric irrigations.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total response for the right ear, $R_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$\nR_{\\text{total}} = V_{\\text{RW}} + V_{\\text{RC}} = 8.2\\,\\text{deg/s} + 7.5\\,\\text{deg/s} = 15.7\\,\\text{deg/s}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the total response for the left ear, $L_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$\nL_{\\text{total}} = V_{\\text{LW}} + V_{\\text{LC}} = 3.6\\,\\text{deg/s} + 3.1\\,\\text{deg/s} = 6.7\\,\\text{deg/s}\n$$\nNow, we substitute these sums into the UW formula.

A normal total response is generally much higher, often exceeding $40\\,\\text{deg/s}$ or $50\\,\\text{deg/s}$. This finding alone is strongly indicative of significant bilateral vestibular hypofunction, a classic presentation of aminoglycoside vestibulotoxicity.\n\nWe now compute the UW as a dimensionless fraction:\n$$\nUW = \\frac{9.0}{22.4} \\approx 0.401785714...\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nUW \\approx 0.4018\n$$\nThis value is commonly expressed as a percentage in clinical reports (i.e., $40.18\\%$). A UW value exceeding $20\\%$ to $25\\%$ ($0.20$ to $0.25$) is typically considered clinically significant for a unilateral weakness or canal paresis.
