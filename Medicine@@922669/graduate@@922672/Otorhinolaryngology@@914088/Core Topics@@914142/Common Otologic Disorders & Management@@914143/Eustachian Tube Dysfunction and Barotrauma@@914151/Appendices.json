The primary governing relations are the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for laminar flow and the definition of the Reynolds number.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between volumetric flow rate $Q$, pressure drop $\\Delta P$, and the geometric and fluid properties for laminar flow in a cylindrical pipe. The Hagen-Poiseuille equation provides this relationship:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nwhere $r$ is the tube radius, $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop across the length $L$, and $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nSecond, we must verify that the flow regime is laminar. The flow regime is characterized by the dimensionless Reynolds number, $Re$, defined for a cylindrical pipe as:\n$$Re = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\eta}$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $v$ is the average flow velocity, and $D$ is the hydraulic diameter of the pipe, which is $D=2r$ for a circular cross-section.

Using a lumped-element model of the external ear canal (EC)–tympanic membrane (TM)–middle ear (ME) system at low frequency, where the static admittance $Y(0)$ approximates the compliance-dominated response and is inversely related to an effective stiffness $k_{\\text{eff}}$, reason from first principles about (i) the type of mechanical load change on the TM implied by the admittance reduction in the context of ET dysfunction with negative ME pressure, and (ii) the ear canal pressure change necessary to restore peak admittance by pressure equalization. Assume the following fundamentals: maximum admittance occurs when the trans-tympanic pressure difference is zero, that is, when $P_{\\text{EC}} = P_{\\text{ME}}$, and at low frequency $Y(0) \\propto \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{eff}}}$ for a stiffness-dominated system. Starting from these principles, derive the form of the mechanical load change and compute the signed change in ear canal pressure $\\Delta P_{\\text{EC}}$ (relative to ambient, with positive values denoting pressurization above ambient and negative values denoting depressurization below ambient) required to reach the pressure at which peak admittance occurs.

This relationship is given as an inverse proportionality:\n$$Y(0) \\propto \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{eff}}}$$\nAcoustic admittance is a measure of how easily sound energy is transmitted into the middle ear. In a stiffness-dominated system, higher stiffness impedes motion, thus reducing admittance.\n\nLet the diver's baseline static admittance be $Y_{\\text{baseline}}$ and the corresponding baseline effective stiffness be $k_{\\text{eff, baseline}}$. Let the newly measured peak admittance be $Y_{\\text{peak}}$ with its corresponding effective stiffness $k_{\\text{eff, peak}}$. According to the problem statement, the new peak admittance is reduced by $40\\%$ compared to the baseline. This can be expressed as:\n$$Y_{\\text{peak}} = (1 - 0.40) Y_{\\text{baseline}} = 0.60 Y_{\\text{baseline}}$$\nUsing the proportionality, we can write:\n$$Y_{\\text{peak}} = C \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{eff, peak}}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad Y_{\\text{baseline}} = C \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{eff, baseline}}}$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nTaking the ratio of the peak to baseline admittance gives:\n$$\\frac{Y_{\\text{peak}}}{Y_{\\text{baseline}}} = \\frac{C / k_{\\text{eff, peak}}}{C / k_{\\text{eff, baseline}}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{eff, baseline}}}{k_{\\text{eff, peak}}}$$\nSubstituting the known reduction in admittance:\n$$0.60 = \\frac{k_{\\text{eff, baseline}}}{k_{\\text{eff, peak}}}$$\nSolving for the new effective stiffness, $k_{\\text{eff, peak}}$, we find:\n$$k_{\\text{eff, peak}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{eff, baseline}}}{0.60} \\approx 1.67 k_{\\text{eff, baseline}}$$\nThis result shows that the effective stiffness of the middle ear system has increased by approximately $67\\%$. An increase in stiffness constitutes an increase in the mechanical load on the system, making it harder to move. This increased stiffness is a pathological finding consistent with the clinical history of barotrauma. Potential causes include middle ear effusion (fluid in the middle ear space), which adds mass and damping but primarily increases the stiffness of the air cushion, or stiffening of the TM and ossicular chain due to inflammation or structural changes. This stiffness increase is measured at the admittance peak (where trans-tympanic pressure is zero), indicating it is an intrinsic change in the middle ear system, not merely a result of the TM being tensed by a pressure differential.\n\n**(ii) Ear Canal Pressure Change**\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the signed change in ear canal pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{EC}}$, required to achieve the condition of peak admittance. The reference for this change is the ambient atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe fundamental principle for tympanometry is that the tympanic membrane-middle ear system has its maximum compliance (and thus maximum admittance at low frequency) when there is no pressure difference across the tympanic membrane. This condition is expressed as:\n$$P_{\\text{EC}} = P_{\\text{ME}}$$\nwhere $P_{\\text{EC}}$ is the pressure in the external ear canal and $P_{\\text{ME}}$ is the pressure in the middle ear. All pressures are measured relative to the ambient atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe problem states that the tympanogram peak is measured to occur at an ear canal pressure of $-150$ daPa. This is the value of $P_{\\text{EC}}$ at which the admittance is maximal for the current state of the ear. Let us denote this pressure as $P_{\\text{EC, peak}}$.\n$$P_{\\text{EC, peak}} = -150 \\text{ daPa}$$\nAccording to the principle of peak admittance, this ear canal pressure must be equal to the middle ear pressure. Therefore, the patient's middle ear pressure is:\n$$P_{\\text{ME}} = P_{\\text{EC, peak}} = -150 \\text{ daPa}$$\nThis significant negative middle ear pressure is a classic sign of Eustachian tube dysfunction.\n\nThe question asks for the change in ear canal pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{EC}}$, needed to reach this peak condition. The measurement starts with the ear canal at ambient pressure. We define the initial ear canal pressure, $P_{\\text{EC, initial}}$, as the ambient pressure, which is $0$ daPa relative to ambient.\n$$P_{\\text{EC, initial}} = 0 \\text{ daPa}$$\nThe final pressure, $P_{\\text{EC, final}}$, is the pressure at which the admittance peak is found.\n$$P_{\\text{EC, final}} = P_{\\text{EC, peak}} = -150 \\text{ daPa}$$\nThe change in pressure is the final pressure minus the initial pressure:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{EC}} = P_{\\text{EC, final}} - P_{\\text{EC, initial}}$$\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{EC}} = (-150 \\text{ daPa}) - (0 \\text{ daPa}) = -150 \\text{ daPa}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that a depressurization (creation of a partial vacuum) of the external ear canal relative to the ambient pressure is necessary to equalize the negative pressure in the middle ear and achieve peak admittance.
