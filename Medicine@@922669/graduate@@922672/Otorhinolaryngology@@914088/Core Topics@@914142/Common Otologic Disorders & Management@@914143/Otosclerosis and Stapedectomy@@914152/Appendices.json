The concepts of air conduction, bone conduction, air-bone gap (ABG), pure-tone average (PTA), and otosclerosis are fundamental and accurately described. The provided audiometric data are clinically plausible for a patient with conductive hearing loss due to stapes fixation.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly structured with defined tasks, given data, and explicit formulas or calculation rules. All required information is present, and the tasks lead to a single, unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem statement is based on quantitative data and standard clinical definitions. It is free from subjective, ambiguous, or opinion-based language.\nThe problem is deemed complete, consistent, and scientifically valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\n**Task 1: Definitions of Air-Bone Gap (ABG) and Pure-Tone Average (PTA)**\nThe auditory system can be stimulated through two primary pathways. Air conduction (AC) involves sound traveling through the outer ear (ear canal), middle ear (tympanic membrane and ossicles), and into the inner ear (cochlea). Bone conduction (BC) bypasses the outer and middle ear, transmitting sound vibrations directly through the bones of the skull to the cochlea.\n\n- The **Air-Bone Gap (ABG)** at a specific frequency is defined as the difference between the air-conduction hearing threshold and the bone-conduction hearing threshold, both measured in decibels hearing level (dB HL). Mathematically, if $AC_f$ and $BC_f$ are the thresholds at frequency $f$, the ABG is $\\Delta_{\\text{ABG}}(f) = AC_f - BC_f$. The ABG quantifies the loss of hearing sensitivity that is attributable to a dysfunction in the conductive pathway (i.e., the outer or middle ear). In otosclerosis, fixation of the stapes bone in the middle ear impedes sound transmission, creating a significant ABG.\n\n- The **Pure-Tone Average (PTA)** is a summary metric of hearing sensitivity, calculated as the arithmetic mean of hearing thresholds at a specified set of standard frequencies. It can be calculated for either air-conduction or bone-conduction thresholds. It provides a single value that is often used to classify the degree of hearing loss.\n\n**Task 2: Computation of Air-Bone Gaps and Average ABG**\nUsing the provided thresholds, we compute the ABG at each frequency:\n- At $f_1 = 500$ Hz: $\\Delta_{\\text{ABG}}(500) = AC_1 - BC_1 = 50 - 20 = 30$ dB.\n- At $f_2 = 1000$ Hz: $\\Delta_{\\text{ABG}}(1000) = AC_2 - BC_2 = 45 - 15 = 30$ dB.\n- At $f_3 = 2000$ Hz: $\\Delta_{\\text{ABG}}(2000) = AC_3 - BC_3 = 50 - 25 = 25$ dB.\n- At $f_4 = 3000$ Hz: $\\Delta_{\\text{ABG}}(3000) = AC_4 - BC_4 = 40 - 15 = 25$ dB.\n\nThe average ABG, denoted $\\overline{\\Delta}_{\\text{ABG}}$, across the specified frequencies ($500$, $1000$, $2000$, and $3000$ Hz) is the arithmetic mean of these values:\n$$\n\\overline{\\Delta}_{\\text{ABG}} = \\frac{\\Delta_{\\text{ABG}}(500) + \\Delta_{\\text{ABG}}(1000) + \\Delta_{\\text{ABG}}(2000) + \\Delta_{\\text{ABG}}(3000)}{4}\n$$\n$$\n\\overline{\\Delta}_{\\text{ABG}} = \\frac{30 + 30 + 25 + 25}{4} = \\frac{110}{4} = 27.5 \\text{ dB}\n$$\n\n**Task 3: Computation of the Bone-Conduction PTA**\nThe three-frequency bone-conduction PTA ($PTA_{BC}$) is calculated using the bone-conduction thresholds at frequencies of $0.5$, $1$, and $2$ kilohertz (i.e., $500$ Hz, $1000$ Hz, and $2000$ Hz).\n$$\nPTA_{BC} = \\frac{BC_{500} + BC_{1000} + BC_{2000}}{3}\n$$\nUsing the provided data, where $BC_{500}=20$, $BC_{1000}=15$, and $BC_{2000}=25$:\n$$\nPTA_{BC} = \\frac{20 + 15 + 25}{3} = \\frac{60}{3} = 20 \\text{ dB HL}\n$$\n\n**Task 4: Calculation of Candidacy Margin, $M$**\nFirst, we assess if the patient meets the criteria for stapes surgery.\n- Criterion $1$: Is the average ABG at least $20$ dB?\nOur calculated $\\overline{\\Delta}_{\\text{ABG}}$ is $27.5$ dB. Since $27.5 \\ge 20$, this criterion is met.\n- Criterion $2$: Is the bone-conduction PTA no worse than $30$ dB HL (i.e., $PTA_{BC} \\le 30$ dB HL)?\nOur calculated $PTA_{BC}$ is $20$ dB HL. Since $20 \\le 30$, this criterion is also met.\n\nThe patient is a candidate for surgery. The candidacy margin, $M$, is defined as $M = \\overline{\\Delta}_{\\text{ABG}} - 20$.\nSubstituting our calculated value for the average ABG:\n$$\nM = 27.5 - 20 = 7.5 \\text{ dB}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
