Histopathology demonstrates poor differentiation. There is no clinical or radiologic evidence of perineural invasion of a named nerve, no bone erosion, and no deep invasion beyond subcutaneous fat. Use the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Eighth Edition staging system for cutaneous carcinoma of the head and neck. The AJCC Eighth Edition considers the following high-risk features: location on the ear or non–hair-bearing lip, poor differentiation, perineural invasion, and deep invasion beyond subcutaneous fat (or thickness $>6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$).

The parameters given (baseline probability, odds ratios) are presented as being derived from meta-analytic summaries, which is a scientifically valid basis for such a model.

It is not ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Part 1: Determination of the T-Category\n\nThe primary tumor ($T$) category for cSCC of the head and neck in the AJCC 8th Edition is determined by a combination of tumor size and the presence of high-risk features or specific invasion patterns. The key definitions are:\n- **T1:** Tumor $\\leq 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ in greatest dimension and with fewer than 2 high-risk features.\n- **T2:** Tumor $> 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ but $\\leq 4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ in greatest dimension, OR a tumor of any size with 2 or more high-risk features (such as poor differentiation or ear location).\n- **T3:** Tumor $> 4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ in greatest dimension OR with minor bone erosion OR perineural invasion (PNI) of a named nerve OR deep invasion (defined as invasion beyond the subcutaneous fat or $>6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ thickness).\n- **T4:** Tumor with gross cortical bone/marrow invasion (T4a) or skull base invasion/foramen involvement (T4b).\n\nLet us apply these definitions to the given case:\n1.  **Tumor Size:** The greatest dimension is $2.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. This measurement satisfies the condition $>2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ but $\\leq 4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, which places the tumor in the $T2$ category based on size alone.\n2.  **High-Risk Features:** The tumor has two high-risk features: location on the ear and poor differentiation. These features are used to define a T2 tumor (e.g., they would upstage a 1cm tumor to T2). Here, they simply reinforce the T2 classification already established by size.\n3.  **Invasion Status:** The problem explicitly states there is no PNI of a named nerve, no bone erosion, and no deep invasion. Therefore, the criteria for a $T3$ or $T4$ tumor are not met.\n\nBased on its size, the tumor is classified as $T2$.\nThe specified numerical code for $T2$ is $2$.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of Nodal Metastasis Probability\n\nThe probability of regional nodal metastasis, $p$, is calculated using a multiplicative odds model.\n\n1.  **Convert Baseline Probability to Baseline Odds:**\nThe relationship between probability $p$ and odds is $\\text{Odds} = \\frac{p}{1-p}$.\nThe baseline probability is $p_0 = 0.02$. The baseline odds are:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_0 = \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} = \\frac{0.02}{1-0.02} = \\frac{0.02}{0.98} = \\frac{2}{98} = \\frac{1}{49}\n$$\n\n2.  **Identify Applicable Risk Factors and Calculate New Odds:**\nWe must check which of the given risk factors apply to this specific tumor:\n- **Ear location:** Yes, the tumor is on the auricle. We apply $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{ear}}=2.0$.\n- **Poor differentiation:** Yes, the histopathology confirms this. We apply $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{poor}}=2.5$.\n- **Size $>2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$:** Yes, the tumor is $2.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. We apply $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{size}}=1.8$.\n\nThe new odds, $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}}$, are found by multiplying the baseline odds by the odds ratios for all applicable risk factors:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}} = \\text{Odds}_0 \\times \\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{ear}} \\times \\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{poor}} \\times \\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{size}}\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1}{49} \\times 2.0 \\times 2.5 \\times 1.8\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1}{49} \\times (5.0 \\times 1.8) = \\frac{1}{49} \\times 9.0 = \\frac{9}{49}\n$$\n\n3.  **Convert New Odds to New Probability:**\nThe relationship to convert odds back to probability is $p = \\frac{\\text{Odds}}{1+\\text{Odds}}$.\nThe estimated probability $p$ of regional nodal metastasis is:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}}}{1+\\text{Odds}_{\\text{new}}} = \\frac{\\frac{9}{49}}{1+\\frac{9}{49}} = \\frac{\\frac{9}{49}}{\\frac{49}{49}+\\frac{9}{49}} = \\frac{\\frac{9}{49}}{\\frac{58}{49}} = \\frac{9}{58}\n$$\n\n4.  **Calculate Numerical Value and Round:**\nFinally, we compute the decimal value and round to three significant figures as requested.\n$$\np = \\frac{9}{58} \\approx 0.1551724...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $p \\approx 0.155$.\n\n### Summary of Results\n- T-category numerical code: $2$\n- Probability of nodal metastasis, $p$: $0.155$\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 0.155\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5070552"}, {"introduction": "Once risk is established, the clinician must often choose between multiple treatment options, each with its own profile of efficacy and burden.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical epidemiology, well-posed with all necessary data provided, and objective in its formulation. We can proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two fundamental metrics in evidence-based medicine: the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and the number needed to treat (NNT). These metrics are used to compare the effectiveness of two interventions.\n\nFirst, we identify the relevant quantities from the problem statement. The context is a comparison between two surgical strategies for infiltrative basal cell carcinoma of the nasal ala over a fixed time horizon of $T=5$ years.\n\nThe control group is an idealized cohort of patients undergoing standard excision with conventional margins. The risk or probability of the adverse event (tumor recurrence) in this group is given as $p_{\\mathrm{exc}}$.\nLet $p_{\\mathrm{control}} = p_{\\mathrm{exc}} = 0.12$.\n\nThe treatment or intervention group is a comparable cohort of patients undergoing Mohs micrographic surgery. The risk of recurrence in this group is given as $p_{\\mathrm{Mohs}}$.\nLet $p_{\\mathrm{treatment}} = p_{\\mathrm{Mohs}} = 0.07$.\n\nThe absolute risk reduction (ARR) is defined as the absolute difference in the event rates between the control group and the treatment group. It quantifies the reduction in risk attributable to the intervention. The formula for ARR is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ARR} = p_{\\mathrm{control}} - p_{\\mathrm{treatment}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ARR} = p_{\\mathrm{exc}} - p_{\\mathrm{Mohs}} = 0.12 - 0.07\n$$\nThe calculation yields:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ARR} = 0.05\n$$\nThis value represents an absolute reduction in recurrence risk of $5$ percentage points when choosing Mohs surgery over standard excision.\n\nNext, we compute the number needed to treat (NNT). The NNT is an interpretive measure defined as the average number of patients who must receive the specific intervention (Mohs surgery) instead of the control intervention (standard excision) for one additional patient to avoid the adverse event (recurrence) over the specified time period. Mathematically, the NNT is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NNT} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{ARR}}\n$$\nUsing the previously calculated value for ARR:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NNT} = \\frac{1}{0.05}\n$$\nTo perform the calculation, we can express the decimal as a fraction:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NNT} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{5}{100}} = \\frac{100}{5} = 20\n$$\nThe result is an integer, as is often the case in NNT calculations, although this is not a requirement. The interpretation is that, on average, for every $20$ patients with infiltrative BCC of the nasal ala treated with Mohs surgery instead of standard excision, one additional recurrence is prevented over a $5$-year period.\n\nThe problem asks for the absolute risk reduction as a decimal proportion and the number needed to treat as a patient count, presented in a single row matrix.\nThe calculated values are $\\mathrm{ARR} = 0.05$ and $\\mathrm{NNT} = 20$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.05 & 20 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5070428"}, {"introduction": "Effective clinical management extends beyond individual patient decisions to encompass strategies for high-risk populations.

You will apply core epidemiological concepts, including incidence rates and relative risk, to calculate the expected number of cancer cases that can be prevented within a large cohort by implementing a change in standard immunosuppressive therapy, thereby quantifying the public health benefit of a clinical intervention.", "problem": "A tertiary otorhinolaryngology skin oncology service follows a cohort of $800$ solid organ transplant recipients for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) of the head and neck. All patients are currently maintained on azathioprine-based immunosuppression. Local surveillance data show that the incidence rate of head-and-neck cSCC in this population while on azathioprine is $18$ per $1000$ person-years. A high-quality meta-analysis reports that switching to Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors is associated with a constant relative risk of cSCC of $0.45$ compared with azathioprine in comparable transplant populations.\n\nDue to clinical contraindications and patient preference, only a fraction $f=0.75$ of the cohort can be switched to mTOR inhibitors at this time.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, presenting a solvable scenario based on established epidemiological principles and plausible clinical data. All necessary information is provided, and there are no internal contradictions.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the expected reduction in the number of new head-and-neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) cases over a specified period if a portion of a high-risk patient cohort is switched to a different immunosuppressive regimen. We will first calculate the expected number of cases without the switch and then with the switch, and the difference will be the desired quantity.\n\nLet us define the given parameters:\n- The total number of patients in the cohort is $N = 800$.\n- The observation period is $T = 3$ years.\n- The incidence rate of cSCC for patients on azathioprine is $I_{AZA} = 18$ per $1000$ person-years, which is equivalent to $I_{AZA} = 0.018 \\text{ cases per person-year}$.\n- The relative risk of cSCC for patients on mTOR inhibitors compared to azathioprine is $RR = 0.45$.\n- The fraction of the cohort that can be switched to mTOR inhibitors is $f = 0.75$.\n\nThe problem states that the incidence rate (or hazard) is constant, which allows us to calculate the expected number of events, $E$, in a population as the product of the incidence rate, $I$, and the total person-time at risk, $PT$.\n$$E = I \\times PT$$\n\nFirst, we determine the incidence rate for the group switched to mTOR inhibitors, $I_{mTOR}$. The relative risk is defined as the ratio of incidence rates:\n$$RR = \\frac{I_{mTOR}}{I_{AZA}}$$\nTherefore, the incidence rate for the mTOR inhibitor group is:\n$$I_{mTOR} = RR \\times I_{AZA} = 0.45 \\times 0.018 \\text{ year}^{-1} = 0.0081 \\text{ year}^{-1}$$\n\nNow, we consider two scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: No intervention (status quo).\nThe entire cohort of $N=800$ patients remains on azathioprine for $T=3$ years. The total person-time at risk is:\n$$PT_{1} = N \\times T = 800 \\times 3 = 2400 \\text{ person-years}$$\nThe expected number of cSCC cases in this scenario, $E_1$, is:\n$$E_1 = I_{AZA} \\times PT_{1} = 0.018 \\text{ year}^{-1} \\times 2400 \\text{ years} = 43.2 \\text{ cases}$$\n\nScenario 2: Partial intervention (the switch).\nThe cohort is divided into two subgroups.\nSubgroup A (switched to mTOR inhibitors):\nThe number of patients in this subgroup is $N_{mTOR} = f \\times N = 0.75 \\times 800 = 600$ patients.\nThe person-time at risk for this subgroup is $PT_{mTOR} = N_{mTOR} \\times T = 600 \\times 3 = 1800$ person-years.\nThe expected number of cases in this subgroup is:\n$$E_{mTOR} = I_{mTOR} \\times PT_{mTOR} = 0.0081 \\text{ year}^{-1} \\times 1800 \\text{ years} = 14.58 \\text{ cases}$$\n\nSubgroup B (remaining on azathioprine):\nThe number of patients in this subgroup is $N_{AZA} = (1-f) \\times N = (1 - 0.75) \\times 800 = 0.25 \\times 800 = 200$ patients.\nThe person-time at risk for this subgroup is $PT_{AZA} = N_{AZA} \\times T = 200 \\times 3 = 600$ person-years.\nThe expected number of cases in this subgroup is:\n$$E_{AZA} = I_{AZA} \\times PT_{AZA} = 0.018 \\text{ year}^{-1} \\times 600 \\text{ years} = 10.8 \\text{ cases}$$\n\nThe total expected number of cases in Scenario 2, $E_2$, is the sum of the cases from both subgroups:\n$$E_2 = E_{mTOR} + E_{AZA} = 14.58 + 10.8 = 25.38 \\text{ cases}$$\n\nThe expected reduction in the number of cases, $\\Delta E$, is the difference between the expected cases in Scenario 1 and Scenario 2.\n$$\\Delta E = E_1 - E_2 = 43.2 - 25.38 = 17.82 \\text{ cases}$$\n\nAlternatively, the reduction can be calculated more directly by considering only the group that is switched. The reduction in cases only occurs within the $N_{mTOR} = 600$ patients who are switched. The reduction in the incidence rate for this group is the Absolute Risk Reduction per unit time, $ARR_{rate}$:\n$$ARR_{rate} = I_{AZA} - I_{mTOR} = I_{AZA} - (RR \\times I_{AZA}) = I_{AZA}(1-RR)$$\n$$ARR_{rate} = 0.018 \\text{ year}^{-1} \\times (1 - 0.45) = 0.018 \\text{ year}^{-1} \\times 0.55 = 0.0099 \\text{ year}^{-1}$$\nThe total expected reduction in cases is this rate reduction multiplied by the person-time of the switched group:\n$$\\Delta E = ARR_{rate} \\times PT_{mTOR} = 0.0099 \\text{ year}^{-1} \\times (600 \\times 3) \\text{ years} = 0.0099 \\times 1800 = 17.82 \\text{ cases}$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to three significant figures.\n$$\\Delta E \\approx 17.8$$\n\nRegarding the justification of the clinical decision, the calculation shows an expected prevention of approximately $17.8$ cases of head-and-neck cSCC over $3$ years in the cohort. To formalize this, we can use the foundational epidemiologic metric of the Number Needed to Treat (NNT). The NNT is the average number of patients who need to receive an intervention to prevent one additional adverse outcome over a specified time period.\n\nIn this context, the \"treatment\" is the switch to mTOR inhibitors, the \"adverse outcome\" is a new cSCC, and the time period is $T=3$ years. The NNT is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction ($ARR$) for the population undergoing treatment. The total number of patients switched is $N_{mTOR} = 600$. The total number of events prevented in this group is $\\Delta E = 17.82$. The absolute risk reduction over $3$ years for the group of patients who were switched is:\n$$ARR_{3yr} = \\frac{\\text{Events Prevented}}{\\text{Number Switched}} = \\frac{\\Delta E}{N_{mTOR}} = \\frac{17.82}{600} \\approx 0.0297$$\nThe NNT over $3$ years is then:\n$$NNT_{3yr} = \\frac{1}{ARR_{3yr}} = \\frac{N_{mTOR}}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{600}{17.82} \\approx 33.67$$\nThis means that for every $34$ patients (rounding up) switched from azathioprine to an mTOR inhibitor, one case of head-and-neck cSCC is expected to be prevented over a $3$-year period.\n\nGiven that cSCC in solid organ transplant recipients is often more aggressive and has a higher metastatic potential than in the general population, and that head-and-neck primary sites can lead to significant morbidity from the tumor itself or its surgical management (functional and cosmetic deficits), an NNT of $34$ is considered highly clinically significant. The expected reduction of nearly $18$ cases in this moderate-sized cohort represents a substantial public health benefit for this specific high-risk population. Thus, the calculated expected reduction provides strong quantitative support for the clinical decision to switch eligible patients to mTOR inhibitors.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{17.8}$$", "id": "5070455"}]}
