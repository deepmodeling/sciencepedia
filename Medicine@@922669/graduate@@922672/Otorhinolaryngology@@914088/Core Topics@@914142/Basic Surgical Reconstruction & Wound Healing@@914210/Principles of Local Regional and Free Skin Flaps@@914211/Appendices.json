Mastering this calculation provides a deep, intuitive understanding of how local tissue transposition can solve complex clinical problems by redistributing tissue forces. [@problem_id:5064800]", "problem": "A symmetric Z-plasty is a transposition flap technique used in Otorhinolaryngology to release linear contractures by redistributing local tissue. It consists of a central limb placed along the line of maximal tension and two equal lateral limbs incised at the ends of the central limb, each making an angle $\\theta$ with the central limb. After transposition, the triangular flaps exchange positions, reorienting the central limb and effectively increasing its length along the direction of the original contracture. Assume a symmetric design in which the lateral limbs have length equal to the original central limb length $c$, and assume idealized Euclidean planar behavior (rigid rotation of flaps without stretch or shear, and negligible thickness).\n\nUsing only first principles of Euclidean geometry (triangle similarity, right-triangle trigonometry, and angle bisection in isosceles triangles), derive an analytic expression $\\Lambda(\\theta)$ for the ratio of the new central limb length $c'$ to the original central limb length $c$ as a function of $\\theta$, and from it the fractional gain $G(\\theta) = \\Lambda(\\theta) - 1$.

We can therefore proceed with the derivation of a solution.\n\nLet the original central limb be represented by the line segment $AB$, with length $|AB| = c$. Let the two lateral limbs be $AC$ and $BD$. According to the problem statement, these limbs are incised at the ends of the central limb, $A$ and $B$, respectively. We are given that the lengths of the lateral limbs are equal to the length of the central limb, so $|AC| = |BD| = c$. The angle each lateral limb makes with the central limb is $\\theta$. We interpret this as $\\angle CAB = \\theta$ and $\\angle ABD = \\theta$. The problem describes a \"symmetric design\", which implies the limbs $AC$ and $BD$ lie on opposite sides of the line containing the central limb $AB$.\n\nThe incisions form a Z-shaped path denoted by the sequence of vertices $C-A-B-D$. The surgical procedure of transposition involves mobilizing the two triangular flaps of tissue and rotating them to new positions. In the idealized geometric model, this transposition results in the segment $CD$ becoming the new central limb, oriented transversely to the original limb $AB$. The length of this new central limb is $c'$. Our first goal is to find an expression for $c'$ in terms of $c$ and $\\theta$.\n\nTo determine the length of $CD$, we can analyze the geometry of the quadrilateral $ACBD$. Let us apply the Law of Cosines to $\\triangle CAB$ to find the length of the side $CB$. The triangle has sides $|AC|=c$, $|AB|=c$, and the angle between them is $\\angle CAB=\\theta$.\nAccording to the Law of Cosines:\n$$|CB|^2 = |AC|^2 + |AB|^2 - 2|AC||AB|\\cos(\\angle CAB)$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$|CB|^2 = c^2 + c^2 - 2(c)(c)\\cos(\\theta) = 2c^2 - 2c^2\\cos(\\theta) = 2c^2(1 - \\cos(\\theta))$$\n\nDue to the symmetric construction of the Z-plasty, $\\triangle DBA$ is congruent to $\\triangle CAB$. Specifically, $|BD|=c$, $|AB|=c$, and $\\angle DBA=\\theta$.

A quadrilateral with opposite sides of equal length is a parallelogram. Therefore, $ACBD$ is a parallelogram.\n\nA fundamental property of a parallelogram is that the sum of the squares of its four sides is equal to the sum of the squares of its two diagonals. The sides of parallelogram $ACBD$ are $AC$, $CB$, $BD$, and $DA$.
