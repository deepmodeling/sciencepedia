It applies a fundamental principle of fluid dynamics, the Hagen–Poiseuille relation, to a valid biophysical model of airflow through a sinus ostium. All necessary information is provided or can be resolved through the calculation of a ratio. Therefore, a rigorous solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the fold-increase in airflow resistance resulting from a narrowing of the maxillary sinus ostium. We begin with the Hagen–Poiseuille equation, which describes the volumetric flow rate $Q$ of a Newtonian fluid in steady, laminar flow through a cylindrical pipe of length $L$ and radius $r$, driven by a pressure difference $\\Delta P$:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$$\nHere, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nThe problem defines airflow resistance $R$ as the ratio of the pressure difference to the volumetric flow rate:\n$$R = \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q}$$\nBy rearranging the Hagen–Poiseuille equation to solve for this ratio, we can express the resistance in terms of the physical parameters of the ostium:\n$$R = \\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r^4}$$\nThis equation shows that resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius, $R \\propto r^{-4}$. This strong dependence is central to the problem.\n\nLet the initial, healthy state of the ostium be characterized by a baseline radius $r_1$ and a corresponding resistance $R_1$.\n$$R_1 = \\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r_1^4}$$\nDue to mucosal edema, the radius is reduced by twenty percent. The new, stenotic radius, $r_2$, can be expressed in terms of the initial radius $r_1$:\n$$r_2 = r_1 - 0.20 r_1 = (1 - 0.20) r_1 = 0.80 r_1 = \\frac{4}{5} r_1$$\nThe new resistance, $R_2$, corresponding to this reduced radius is:\n$$R_2 = \\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r_2^4}$$\nWe are asked to find the multiplicative fold-increase in resistance, which is the ratio $\\frac{R_2}{R_1}$.\n$$\\frac{R_2}{R_1} = \\frac{\\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r_2^4}}{\\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r_1^4}}$$\nThe constants $8$, $\\mu$, $L$, and $\\pi$ are identical for both states and thus cancel, simplifying the expression to a ratio of the radii:\n$$\\frac{R_2}{R_1} = \\frac{r_1^4}{r_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_2}\\right)^4$$\nNow, we substitute the relationship between $r_1$ and $r_2$:\n$$\\frac{r_1}{r_2} = \\frac{r_1}{\\frac{4}{5} r_1} = \\frac{5}{4}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the resistance ratio gives the final dimensionless fold-increase:\n$$\\frac{R_2}{R_1} = \\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^4 = \\frac{5^4}{4^4} = \\frac{625}{256}$$\nAs a decimal, this value is approximately $2.4414$. The exact fraction is $\\frac{625}{256}$.\n\nThe clinical consequence of this substantial increase in resistance can be inferred directly from its definition. Since $Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R}$, a $2.441$-fold increase in resistance implies that for a constant physiological pressure difference, the airflow (sinus ventilation) is reduced to $\\frac{1}{2.4414} \\approx 41\\%$ of its normal value. This severe impairment of ventilation leads to the retention of carbon dioxide and depletion of oxygen within the sinus cavity, creating an environment favorable for the proliferation of pathogenic, often anaerobic, bacteria. Furthermore, the principles of fluid dynamics also apply to the drainage of mucus. The dramatically increased resistance severely impedes mucociliary clearance, causing secretions to stagnate. This stasis of mucus provides a nutrient-rich medium for bacterial growth, further perpetuating the cycle of infection and inflammation characteristic of acute rhinosinusitis. The fourth-power relationship in the Hagen-Poiseuille law demonstrates why even a seemingly minor reduction in the ostial radius ($20\\%$) has profound and clinically significant consequences.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{625}{256}}$$", "id": "5059516"}, {"introduction": "While Computed Tomography (CT) imaging provides a detailed view of sinonasal inflammation, a standardized method is needed to quantify the disease burden for clinical and research purposes.

Chronic rhinosinusitis, CT imaging, the Lund-Mackay scoring system, and the SN-5 survey are all standard, well-documented tools and concepts in clinical medicine. The anatomical descriptions and pathological findings are realistic.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

The scoring rules are quantitative and free from subjective interpretation.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, complete, and feasible.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to compute the total Lund–Mackay score based on the provided Computed Tomography (CT) findings and scoring rules. The total score is the sum of scores for five sinuses and the ostiomeatal complex (OMC) on both the left and right sides. The maximum possible score is $12$ per side, for a total of $24$.\n\nWe will calculate the score for each side separately.\n\n**Left Side Score Calculation:**\n- Maxillary sinus (complete mucosal opacification): Score = $2$.\n- Anterior ethmoid cells (partial mucosal opacification): Score = $1$.\n- Posterior ethmoid cells (aerated and clear): Score = $0$.\n- Sphenoid sinus (partial mucosal opacification): Score = $1$.\n- Frontal sinus (present, aerated, and clear): Score = $0$.\n- Ostiomeatal Complex (obstructed): Score = $2$.\n\nThe total score for the left side, $S_L$, is the sum of these individual scores:\n$$S_L = 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 2 = 6$$\n\n**Right Side Score Calculation:**\n- Maxillary sinus (partial mucosal opacification): Score = $1$.\n- Anterior ethmoid cells (partial mucosal opacification): Score = $1$.\n- Posterior ethmoid cells (complete mucosal opacification): Score = $2$.\n- Sphenoid sinus (aerated and clear): Score = $0$.\n- Frontal sinus (aplastic): The rule explicitly states to assign a score of $0$ if a sinus is not present (aplasia). Therefore, Score = $0$.\n- Ostiomeatal Complex (patent): Score = $0$.\n\nThe total score for the right side, $S_R$, is the sum of these individual scores:\n$$S_R = 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 4$$\n\n**Total Lund–Mackay Score Calculation:**\nThe total Lund–Mackay score, $S_{Total}$, is the sum of the left and right side scores:\n$$S_{Total} = S_L + S_R = 6 + 4 = 10$$\n\nThe total Lund–Mackay score is $10$.\n\n**Interpretation:**\nThe problem also requires an interpretation of this score in the context of the patient's symptom severity. The calculated Lund-Mackay score is $10$ out of a maximum possible score of $24$. This represents a moderate level of radiographic disease burden. The caregiver-reported SN-5 score is $3.4$ on a $1$ to $7$ scale, which also indicates a moderate level of symptom severity. In this specific case, there is a concordance between the moderate radiographic findings and the moderate symptom score.\n\nHowever, it is a well-established principle in pediatric rhinosinusitis research that the correlation between the Lund-Mackay score (an objective measure of radiographic inflammation) and symptom severity scores like the SN-5 (a subjective measure of quality of life impact) is often weak and inconsistent. A high Lund-Mackay score does not always predict severe symptoms, and conversely, severe symptoms can be present with a low Lund-Mackay score. The finding in this case, where moderate radiographic disease corresponds to moderate symptoms, is a plausible clinical scenario but does not invalidate the general principle of poor correlation. This dissociation underscores the importance of considering both clinical symptoms and radiographic evidence in the management of pediatric chronic rhinosinusitis, as radiographic findings alone are not a sufficient proxy for patient suffering.\nThe final required answer is the numerical score.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "5059603"}, {"introduction": "Effective management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis requires not only a correct diagnosis but also precise, evidence-based pharmacotherapy.

The corresponding total daily mass of clavulanate is:\n$$M_{clav, total, high} = M_{amox, total, high} \\times R = (1980\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{day}) \\times 0.0715 = 141.57\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{day}$$\n\nTo express this as a dose rate per unit mass of the patient:\n$$D_{clav, high} = \\frac{M_{clav, total, high}}{m} = \\frac{141.57\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{day}}{22\\,\\mathrm{kg}} \\approx 6.435\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{day}$$\nSince $6.435\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{day}  10\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{day}$, the high-dose regimen is safe with respect to the clavulanate limit using this specific suspension.

Therefore, the selected regimen is the high-dose regimen ($90\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{day}$).\n\nThe per-dose volume for the high-dose regimen was calculated as $V_{per\\_dose, high} = 8.25\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.
