The fundamental genetic principles we use are:\n\n- In autosomal dominant inheritance, a heterozygous affected parent transmits the pathogenic allele to each offspring with probability $0.5$ under standard Mendelian segregation.\n- Penetrance $p$ is defined as the probability that an individual who carries the pathogenic allele expresses the phenotype. Therefore, if an offspring inherits the allele, the probability that the offspring manifests the craniosynostosis phenotype is $p$.\n\nLet $I$ denote the event that the offspring inherits the pathogenic allele, and let $E$ denote the event that the offspring expresses the craniosynostosis phenotype. We are asked for the recurrence risk, which is the probability that the offspring expresses craniosynostosis. Under the assumptions provided (no mosaicism, independence of expression conditional on carriage, and standard segregation), this is $\\Pr(E) = \\Pr(E \\mid I)\\Pr(I) + \\Pr(E \\mid I^{c})\\Pr(I^{c})$.\n\nBecause the craniosynostosis phenotype in this syndrome is attributable to the pathogenic variant and the father is confirmed negative for the variant, we take $\\Pr(E \\mid I^{c}) = 0$. By definition of penetrance, $\\Pr(E \\mid I) = p$, and for a heterozygous autosomal dominant parent, $\\Pr(I) = 0.5$.

Derivation of the Relationship**\n\nFirst, we establish the geometric framework from the provided definitions. All three angles, $\\angle SNA$, $\\angle SNB$, and $\\angle ANB$, share a common vertex at the Nasion ($N$). The angles $\\angle SNA$ and $\\angle SNB$ share a common reference ray, which originates at $N$ and passes through Sella ($S$). Let us denote the rays from $N$ to $S$, $A$, and $B$ as $\\vec{NS}$, $\\vec{NA}$, and $\\vec{NB}$, respectively.\n\nThe angle $\\angle SNA$ is the angle between the rays $\\vec{NS}$ and $\\vec{NA}$.\nThe angle $\\angle SNB$ is the angle between the rays $\\vec{NS}$ and $\\vec{NB}$.\nThe angle $\\angle ANB$ is the angle between the rays $\\vec{NA}$ and $\\vec{NB}$.\n\nIn the sagittal plane, these rays originate from a common point $N$. According to the angle addition postulate in Euclidean geometry, if a ray lies in the interior of an angle, it divides the angle into two smaller adjacent angles whose measures sum to the measure of the original angle. In the typical human craniofacial anatomy, Point A (Subspinale, representing the maxilla) is located anterior to Point B (Supramentale, representing the mandible) relative to the Nasion. This implies that for angles measured from the cranial base reference line SN, the ray $\\vec{NB}$ lies within the interior of the angle $\\angle SNA$.\n\nTherefore, we can express the larger angle $\\angle SNA$ as the sum of its constituent parts: $\\angle SNA = \\angle SNB + \\angle BNA$.\nThe angle $\\angle BNA$ is geometrically identical to the angle $\\angle ANB$ (the angle at vertex $N$ between segments $NA$ and $NB$). Thus, we can substitute $\\angle ANB$ for $\\angle BNA$: $\\angle SNA = \\angle SNB + \\angle ANB$.\nTo derive the relationship for $\\angle ANB$, we rearrange the equation: $\\angle ANB = \\angle SNA - \\angle SNB$.\nThis formula is the standard first-principles derivation for relating these three fundamental cephalometric angles.\n\n**2. Computation of the $\\angle ANB$ Value**\n\nThe problem provides the measured values:\n$\\angle SNA = 80^{\\circ}$\n$\\angle SNB = 75^{\\circ}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$\\angle ANB = 80^{\\circ} - 75^{\\circ} = 5^{\\circ}$.\n\n**3. Interpretation of the Sagittal Jaw Relationship**\n\nThe task is to articulate how this result is interpreted in the context of syndromic midface retrusion, using cephalometric reasoning.\n\nThe computed $\\angle ANB$ of $5^{\\circ}$ indicates the sagittal relationship *between* the maxilla and the mandible. With a normative value typically cited around $2^{\\circ}$, a value of $5^{\\circ}$ signifies a Class II skeletal pattern, where the maxilla is positioned significantly anterior to the mandible.\n\nAt first glance, this Class II finding may seem contradictory to the clinical diagnosis of \"midface retrusion,\" which suggests a posteriorly positioned maxilla (a Class III tendency). However, cephalometric reasoning requires examining the component angles, not just their difference.\n- The $\\angle SNA$ value of $80^{\\circ}$ (normative mean $\\approx 82^{\\circ}$) measures the position of the maxilla relative to the anterior cranial base (SN line). This value is at the lower limit of the normal range, indicating a mild maxillary retrusion. This measurement is consistent with the diagnosis of midface retrusion.\n- The $\\angle SNB$ value of $75^{\\circ}$ (normative mean $\\approx 80^{\\circ}$) measures the position of the mandible relative to the cranial base. This value is significantly below the norm, indicating a pronounced mandibular retrusion (retrognathia).\n\nSynthesizing these findings, the analysis reveals that although the patient presents with midface retrusion (quantified by the low-normal $\\angle SNA$), the mandible is even more severely retrusive (quantified by the low $\\angle SNB$). The resulting Class II jaw relationship ($\\angle ANB = 5^{\\circ}$) is therefore a \"relative\" one. It is not caused by a protrusive maxilla, but rather by the mandible being positioned further posterior than the already retrusive maxilla. This complex pattern of bimaxillary retrusion, with the mandible being more affected than the maxilla, is a recognized presentation in various syndromic craniosynostosis conditions affecting a child of $10$ years. The ANB angle, by itself, is insufficient for diagnosis and must be interpreted in the context of the SNA and SNB angles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "5077070"}, {"introduction": "Many syndromic craniofacial anomalies are associated with significant functional deficits, with hearing loss being one of the most common. This hands-on practice focuses on the fundamental principles of audiometric interpretation, specifically how to quantify the conductive component of hearing loss.

Air conduction testing assesses the entire auditory pathway. The measured threshold, $T_{AC}$, therefore quantifies the total hearing loss. This total loss can be conceptualized as the combination of loss occurring in the conductive pathway (outer and middle ear), which we can denote $L_C$, and loss occurring in the sensorineural pathway (inner ear and auditory nerve), which we can denote $L_{SN}$. The measured threshold $T_{AC}$ reflects the sound intensity required to overcome this total systemic loss.\n\n$2$. Bone conduction testing bypasses the conductive pathway and directly stimulates the inner ear (cochlea). The measured threshold, $T_{BC}$, therefore quantifies only the sensorineural component of hearing loss. Thus, $T_{BC}$ is a direct measure of the sensorineural loss, $L_{SN}$.\n\nThe air–bone gap ($ABG$) is defined as the component of hearing loss that is attributable exclusively to the conductive pathway. To isolate this component, we must subtract the sensorineural part of the hearing loss from the total hearing loss.\n\nUsing the thresholds as proxies for the hearing loss components:\n- Total Hearing Loss is represented by the measurement $T_{AC}$.\n- Sensorineural Hearing Loss is represented by the measurement $T_{BC}$.\n\nThe conductive hearing loss, which is the $ABG$, is therefore derived by the subtraction: $ABG = (\\text{Total Hearing Loss}) - (\\text{Sensorineural Hearing Loss})$.\nSubstituting the measurable quantities: $ABG = T_{AC} - T_{BC}$.\nThis equation provides the magnitude of the conductive hearing loss in $\\mathrm{dB}$.\n\nNext, we compute the $ABG$ magnitude at the specified frequency of $1\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ using the data provided in the problem statement:\n- Masked air conduction threshold: $T_{AC} = 60\\,\\mathrm{dB\\ HL}$\n- Masked bone conduction threshold: $T_{BC} = 25\\,\\mathrm{dB\\ HL}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula: $ABG = 60 - 25 = 35$.\nThe magnitude of the air–bone gap at $1\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ is $35\\,\\mathrm{dB\\ HL}$.\n\nFinally, we must infer the severity of the conductive component based on established audiologic interpretive principles.
