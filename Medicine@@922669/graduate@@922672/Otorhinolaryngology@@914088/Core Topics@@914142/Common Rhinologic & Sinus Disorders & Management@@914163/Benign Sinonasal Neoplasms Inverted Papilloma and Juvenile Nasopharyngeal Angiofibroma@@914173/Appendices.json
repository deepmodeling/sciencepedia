It contains no fatal flaws. Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the post-test probability, $P(D \\mid T^{+})$, from first principles and then calculate its value.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has the disease (JNA), and let $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have the disease.\nLet $T^{+}$ be the event of a positive test result (the specified MRI finding).\n\nThe pre-test probability of having the disease is given as $P(D) = 0.005$.\nThe probability of not having the disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995$.\n\nAccording to the definition of conditional probability, the post-test probability $P(D \\mid T^{+})$ is:\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^{+})}{P(T^{+})} $$\nwhere $P(D \\cap T^{+})$ is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive, and $P(T^{+})$ is the overall probability of testing positive.\n\nThe numerator can be rewritten using the product rule for probability:\n$$ P(D \\cap T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\mid D) P(D) $$\nwhere $P(T^{+} \\mid D)$ is the sensitivity of the test.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^{+})$, can be expanded using the law of total probability by conditioning on the disease status ($D$ or $D^c$):\n$$ P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\mid D) P(D) + P(T^{+} \\mid D^c) P(D^c) $$\nwhere $P(T^{+} \\mid D^c)$ is the false positive rate of the test.\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the formula for $P(D \\mid T^{+})$ gives Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^{+} \\mid D) P(D) + P(T^{+} \\mid D^c) P(D^c)} $$\n\nThe problem provides the positive likelihood ratio, $\\text{LR}_{+}$, which is defined as the ratio of the true positive rate (sensitivity) to the false positive rate:\n$$ \\text{LR}_{+} = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid D)}{P(T^{+} \\mid D^c)} = 20 $$\n\nTo derive the required expression in terms of $\\text{LR}_{+}$ and $P(D)$, we can divide the numerator and the denominator of the Bayes' theorem expression by $P(T^{+} \\mid D^c)$:\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{\\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid D)}{P(T^{+} \\mid D^c)} P(D)}{\\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid D)}{P(T^{+} \\mid D^c)} P(D) + \\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid D^c)}{P(T^{+} \\mid D^c)} P(D^c)} $$\n\nBy substituting the definition of $\\text{LR}_{+}$ and recalling that $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D)$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{\\text{LR}_{+} \\cdot P(D)}{\\text{LR}_{+} \\cdot P(D) + 1 \\cdot (1 - P(D))} $$\nThis is the formal expression for post-test probability derived from first principles using the likelihood ratio.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $P(D) = 0.005$ and $\\text{LR}_{+} = 20$.\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{20 \\cdot 0.005}{20 \\cdot 0.005 + (1 - 0.005)} $$\nFirst, we calculate the products and sums:\n- Numerator: $20 \\times 0.005 = 0.1$\n- Denominator: $(20 \\times 0.005) + (1 - 0.005) = 0.1 + 0.995 = 1.095$\n\nSo, the post-test probability is the ratio:\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{0.1}{1.095} $$\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}) \\approx 0.0913242009... $$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant digits are $9, 1, 3, 2$. The fifth significant digit is $4$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}) \\approx 0.09132 $$\nThus, a positive MRI finding increases the probability of JNA from $0.5\\%$ to approximately $9.132\\%$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.09132}$$", "id": "5010116"}, {"introduction": "Preoperative embolization is a crucial intervention for managing hypervascular tumors like JNA, aiming to minimize intraoperative blood loss.
