The solution will be derived using the odds-likelihood ratio form of Bayes' theorem.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant events and probabilities.\nLet $D$ represent the event that the patient has ABRS.\nLet $\\neg D$ represent the event that the patient does not have ABRS.\nThe given pretest probability of ABRS is $P(D) = 0.25$.\nFrom this, the probability of not having ABRS is $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n\nThe odds of an event are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring.

This means that $P(E_1 \\cap E_2 | D) = P(E_1|D)P(E_2|D)$ and $P(E_1 \\cap E_2 | \\neg D) = P(E_1|\\neg D)P(E_2|\\neg D)$. Therefore, the combined likelihood ratio for observing both positive findings, $LR_{\\text{comb},+}$, is the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$\nLR_{\\text{comb},+} = \\frac{P(E_1 \\cap E_2 | D)}{P(E_1 \\cap E_2 | \\neg D)} = \\frac{P(E_1|D)P(E_2|D)}{P(E_1|\\neg D)P(E_2|\\neg D)} = \\left(\\frac{P(E_1|D)}{P(E_1|\\neg D)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{P(E_2|D)}{P(E_2|\\neg D)}\\right) = LR_{1,+} \\times LR_{2,+}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nLR_{\\text{comb},+} = 3 \\times 2 = 6\n$$\n\nBayes' theorem in its odds-likelihood form states that the posterior odds are the product of the pretest odds and the likelihood ratio(s).
