The problem states that $C_{ij}$ is the expected value of this quantity. Thus, we have:\n$$\nE[N_{ij}] = C_{ij}\n$$\nThe problem also provides the effective per-contact spillover probability, $p = 4.2 \\times 10^{-7}$. This probability is constant and independent for each contact.\n\nLet $Z_{ij}$ be the random variable for the number of spillover events resulting from contacts between taxon $i$ and interface $j$ in one day. To find the expected value of $Z_{ij}$, we can use the law of total expectation (also known as the law of iterated expectations). We first condition on the number of contacts, $N_{ij}$.\nGiven that $N_{ij} = n_{ij}$ contacts have occurred, each contact independently leads to an infection with probability $p$. This scenario is a sequence of $n_{ij}$ Bernoulli trials. The number of spillovers, $Z_{ij}$, conditioned on $N_{ij}=n_{ij}$, follows a binomial distribution:\n$$\nZ_{ij} | (N_{ij} = n_{ij}) \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n_{ij}, p)\n$$\nThe expected value of a binomial distribution $\\text{Binomial}(n, p)$ is $np$. Therefore, the conditional expectation of $Z_{ij}$ is:\n$$\nE[Z_{ij} | N_{ij} = n_{ij}] = n_{ij} p\n$$\nThis relationship holds for any specific value $n_{ij}$ that the random variable $N_{ij}$ can take. We can thus write:\n$$\nE[Z_{ij} | N_{ij}] = N_{ij} p\n$$\nNow, using the law of total expectation, the unconditional expectation $E[Z_{ij}]$ is the expectation of the conditional expectation:\n$$\nE[Z_{ij}] = E[E[Z_{ij} | N_{ij}]]\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the conditional expectation, we get:\n$$\nE[Z_{ij}] = E[N_{ij} p]\n$$\nSince $p$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$\nE[Z_{ij}] = p E[N_{ij}]\n$$\nWe know that $E[N_{ij}] = C_{ij}$, so we find the expected number of spillovers from each source $(i,j)$ is:\n$$\nE[Z_{ij}] = p C_{ij}\n$$\nThe total number of spillover events per day, $Z$, is the sum of the spillover events from all disjoint sources. The problem specifies that contacts across distinct pairs $(i,j)$ are independent, which implies that the random variables $Z_{ij}$ are also independent. The expected total number of spillovers, $\\lambda_Z = E[Z]$, is the sum of the individual expectations due to the linearity of expectation:\n$$\n\\lambda_{Z} = E[Z] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{I} \\sum_{j=1}^{J} Z_{ij}\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{I} \\sum_{j=1}^{J} E[Z_{ij}]\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E[Z_{ij}]$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{Z} = \\sum_{i=1}^{I} \\sum_{j=1}^{J} p C_{ij}\n$$\nAgain, since $p$ is constant across all contact types, we can factor it out of the summation:\n$$\n\\lambda_{Z} = p \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{I} \\sum_{j=1}^{J} C_{ij}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the expected daily spillover event rate.

The Galton–Watson branching process is the canonical model for studying the initial phase of an epidemic. The assumption of a Poisson-distributed offspring number is a common and reasonable simplification. The concepts of $R_0$ and spillover force $\\lambda_Z$ are fundamental to the field of infectious disease dynamics.

It provides all necessary parameters ($R_{0,A}$, $R_{0,B}$) and a precise, quantitative definition of the \"emergence\" criterion. The question asks for a logical deduction based on these premises. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution can be derived from the theory of branching processes.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, mathematical language. The operational definition of \"emergence\" removes ambiguity and subjectivity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded question that can be answered rigorously from first principles. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## Derivation of Solution\n\nThe problem asks us to evaluate which pathogen meets a specific emergence criterion based on the theory of branching processes.\n\n1.  **Model Setup**: The number of secondary infections caused by a single infected individual is denoted by a random variable $X$. According to the problem statement, this variable follows a Poisson distribution with mean $R_0$.\n    $$P(X = k) = \\frac{e^{-R_0}R_0^k}{k!} \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$$\n\n2.  **Extinction Probability in a Galton–Watson Process**: A transmission chain starting from a single individual will eventually go extinct with a probability $\\pi_0$. This probability is the smallest non-negative root of the equation $s = G(s)$, where $G(s)$ is the probability generating function (PGF) of the offspring distribution $X$.\n\n3.  **Probability Generating Function for a Poisson Distribution**: The PGF for a Poisson-distributed random variable with mean $\\lambda$ is given by:\n    $$G(s) = E[s^X] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} s^k P(X=k) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} s^k \\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^k}{k!} = e^{-\\lambda} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(s\\lambda)^k}{k!} = e^{-\\lambda}e^{s\\lambda} = e^{\\lambda(s-1)}$$\n    In our case, the mean is $R_0$, so the PGF is:\n    $$G(s) = e^{R_0(s-1)}$$\n\n4.  **Equation for Extinction Probability**: The extinction probability $\\pi_0$ is the smallest non-negative solution to the equation $s = G(s)$:\n    $$\\pi_0 = e^{R_0(\\pi_0-1)}$$\n    It is a known result from branching process theory that if $R_0 \\le 1$, the only solution is $\\pi_0 = 1$ (extinction is certain). If $R_0  1$, there is a unique solution $\\pi_0 \\in [0, 1)$.\n\n5.  **Emergence Criterion**: The problem defines \"emergence\" as the case where the per-introduction probability of *non-extinction* exceeds $0.5$. The probability of non-extinction, let's call it $p_{sustain}$, is:\n    $$p_{sustain} = 1 - \\pi_0$$\n    The emergence criterion is therefore $p_{sustain}  0.5$, which is equivalent to:\n    $$1 - \\pi_0  0.5 \\implies \\pi_0  0.5$$\n\n6.  **Finding the Threshold Value of $R_0$**: We need to find the value of $R_0$ for which the emergence criterion is met. The boundary case occurs when $\\pi_0 = 0.5$. We can substitute this value into the equation for $\\pi_0$ to find the corresponding $R_0$:\n    $$0.5 = e^{R_0(0.5-1)}$$\n    $$0.5 = e^{-0.5 R_0}$$\n    Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n    $$\\ln(0.5) = -0.5 R_0$$\n    $$\\ln(2^{-1}) = -0.5 R_0$$\n    $$-\\ln(2) = -0.5 R_0$$\n    $$R_0 = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.5} = 2 \\ln(2)$$\n    Numerically, this threshold is $R_0 \\approx 2 \\times 0.6931 = 1.3862$.\n\n7.  **Interpreting the Threshold**: The extinction probability $\\pi_0$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $R_0$ for $R_0  1$. Therefore, the inequality $\\pi_0  0.5$ is satisfied if and only if $R_0  2 \\ln(2)$. So, the emergence criterion translates to $R_0  2 \\ln(2) \\approx 1.3862$.\n\n8.  **Evaluating Pathogens A and B**:\n    -   **Pathogen A**: $R_{0,A} = 1.2$. Since $1.2  2 \\ln(2)$, Pathogen A does *not* meet the emergence criterion. Its probability of sustained transmission per introduction is less than $0.5$.\n    -   **Pathogen B**: $R_{0,B} = 1.6$. Since $1.6  2 \\ln(2)$, Pathogen B *does* meet the emergence criterion. Its probability of sustained transmission per introduction is greater than $0.5$.\n\n9.  **Role of Spillover Force $\\lambda_Z$**: The emergence criterion is defined on a \"per-introduction\" basis ($p_{sustain}$). This probability depends only on $R_0$ and the offspring distribution shape. The spillover rate $\\lambda_Z$ determines how often these introduction 'trials' occur, but it does not influence the success probability of a single trial. The problem correctly isolates the effect of human-to-human transmission potential ($R_0$) by holding $\\lambda_Z$ constant.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

Our calculation for the threshold $R_0 = 2 \\ln(2) \\approx 1.3862$ explicitly proves that an $R_0$ value between $1$ and $1.3862$ (like $R_{0,A}=1.2$) will have $p_{sustain}  0.5$.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Neither Pathogen A nor Pathogen B meets the emergence criterion; without increasing $\\lambda_Z$ the probability per introduction cannot exceed $0.5$ regardless of $R_0$.**\n-   \"Neither Pathogen A nor Pathogen B meets the emergence criterion\": This is false, as Pathogen B does.\n-   The reasoning \"the probability per introduction cannot exceed $0.5$ regardless of $R_0$\" is false.

This means that $\\lambda(A)$ must be a monotonically increasing function of $A$. Mathematically, we are looking for the condition that ensures:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\lambda}{dA}  0\n$$\n\nThe relationship for the force of infection is given as a proportionality:\n$$\n\\lambda(A) \\propto \\beta \\, p(A) \\, D(A) \\, c_e(A)\n$$\nSince $\\beta$ is a constant, we can write this as an equality with a constant of proportionality $k$:\n$$\n\\lambda(A) = k \\beta \\, p(A) \\, D(A) \\, c_e(A)\n$$\nLet's define a new constant $K = k\\beta$.\n$$\n\\lambda(A) = K \\, p(A) \\, D(A) \\, c_e(A)\n$$\nTo analyze the derivative of this product, it is most convenient to work with logarithms.

These two conditions are not equivalent. The correct condition depends on the values of $D(A)$ and $c_e(A)$ themselves, not just their derivatives. The option incorrectly compares the raw magnitudes of the derivatives, which is dimensionally and conceptually flawed.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In a specific case where $ D(A) = D_0 A^{1/2} $ and $ c_e(A) = c_0 A^{-1/3} $ for positive constants $ D_0 $ and $ c_0 $, and $ p(A) $ is constant, habitat loss will reduce spillover risk.**\n\nWe must check if the condition for risk reduction is met for this specific case. For a power-law function $X(A) = C A^k$, the elasticity is $\\epsilon_X = \\frac{d\\ln(CA^k)}{d\\ln(A)} = k$.\nFor $D(A) = D_0 A^{1/2}$, the elasticity is $\\epsilon_D = 1/2$.\nFor $c_e(A) = c_0 A^{-1/3}$, the elasticity is $\\epsilon_{c_e} = -1/3$.\nSince $p(A)$ is constant, $\\epsilon_p = 0$.\n\nThe condition for risk to decrease with habitat loss is $\\epsilon_p + \\epsilon_D + \\epsilon_{c_e}  0$.\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\n0 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3}{6} - \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\nSince $\\frac{1}{6}  0$, the condition is satisfied. Therefore, in this specific case, habitat loss will reduce spillover risk.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Even if $ D(A) $ declines with habitat loss, spillover risk cannot decrease unless $ p(A) $ declines with habitat loss; therefore, habitat loss cannot reduce spillover risk if $ p(A) $ is constant.**\n\nThis statement claims that for spillover risk to decrease with habitat loss (i.e. for $\\epsilon_p + \\epsilon_D + \\epsilon_{c_e}  0$), it is necessary that $p(A)$ also declines with habitat loss (i.e. $\\frac{dp}{dA}  0$, or $\\epsilon_p  0$). The second part of the statement is a direct consequence: if $p(A)$ is constant, then $\\epsilon_p=0$, and according to the premise, the condition for risk reduction cannot be met.\n\nHowever, this is demonstrably false. As shown in the analysis of option A, if $p(A)$ is constant ($\\epsilon_p=0$), risk reduction with habitat loss is possible if and only if $\\epsilon_D + \\epsilon_{c_e}  0$. Since we know $\\epsilon_D  0$ and $\\epsilon_{c_e}  0$, this condition can be met if the positive elasticity of host density is larger in magnitude than the negative elasticity of the contact rate.\n\nOption C provides a concrete counterexample. In that case, $p(A)$ is constant ($\\epsilon_p = 0$), yet habitat loss reduces spillover risk because $\\epsilon_D + \\epsilon_{c_e} = 1/6  0$. Therefore, the statement in option D is false.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "4638889"}]}
