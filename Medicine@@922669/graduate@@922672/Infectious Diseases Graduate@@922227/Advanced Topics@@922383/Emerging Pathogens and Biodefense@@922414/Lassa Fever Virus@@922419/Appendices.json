The problem asks for a derivation of the net driving pressure and the resulting volumetric flux from first principles.\n\nThe net transvascular fluid movement is driven by the difference between two opposing forces: the hydrostatic pressure gradient, which tends to push fluid out of the capillary, and the effective oncotic pressure gradient, which tends to draw fluid into the capillary.\n\n$1$. The hydrostatic pressure gradient, $\\Delta P$, is the difference between the capillary hydrostatic pressure, $P_c$, and the interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure, $P_i$. This gradient favors filtration (movement out of the capillary).\n$$ \\Delta P = P_c - P_i $$\n\n$2$. The oncotic pressure gradient, $\\Delta \\pi$, is the difference between the capillary oncotic pressure, $\\pi_c$, and the interstitial fluid oncotic pressure, $\\pi_i$.\n$$ \\Delta \\pi = \\pi_c - \\pi_i $$\nSince the capillary wall is not perfectly impermeable to proteins (the solutes responsible for oncotic pressure), the effective oncotic pressure gradient is modulated by the protein reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$. The coefficient $\\sigma$ can range from $0$ (freely permeable) to $1$ (completely impermeable). The effective oncotic pressure gradient, which opposes filtration, is given by $\\sigma \\Delta \\pi$.\n\n$3$. The net driving pressure, $P_{net}$, is the algebraic sum of the hydrostatic pressure gradient and the effective oncotic pressure gradient.\n$$ P_{net} = \\Delta P - \\sigma \\Delta \\pi $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the gradients gives the full form:\n$$ P_{net} = (P_c - P_i) - \\sigma (\\pi_c - \\pi_i) $$\nA positive $P_{net}$ indicates net filtration, while a negative $P_{net}$ indicates net absorption.\n\n$4$. The volumetric flux, $J_v$, which represents the rate of fluid movement across the capillary wall, is directly proportional to the net driving pressure. The constant of proportionality is the filtration coefficient, $K_f$, which accounts for the hydraulic conductivity and surface area of the capillary bed.\n$$ J_v = K_f \\cdot P_{net} $$\n$$ J_v = K_f [(P_c - P_i) - \\sigma (\\pi_c - \\pi_i)] $$\n\nNow, we calculate the parameter values for the infected state, denoted by the subscript $1$.\n- New capillary hydrostatic pressure: $P_{c,1} = P_{c,0} + \\Delta P_c = 18 \\text{ mmHg} + 4 \\text{ mmHg} = 22 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- New interstitial hydrostatic pressure: $P_{i,1} = P_{i,0} + \\Delta P_i = -2 \\text{ mmHg} + 3 \\text{ mmHg} = 1 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- New capillary oncotic pressure: $\\pi_{c,1} = \\pi_{c,0} + \\Delta \\pi_c = 25 \\text{ mmHg} - 7 \\text{ mmHg} = 18 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- New interstitial oncotic pressure: $\\pi_{i,1} = \\pi_{i,0} + \\Delta \\pi_i = 2 \\text{ mmHg} + 4 \\text{ mmHg} = 6 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- New protein reflection coefficient: $\\sigma_{1} = 0.4$\n- New filtration coefficient: $K_{f,1} = 3.0 \\times K_{f,0} = 3.0 \\times (0.005 \\text{ mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{mmHg}^{-1}) = 0.015 \\text{ mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{mmHg}^{-1}$\n\nNext, we compute the net driving pressure under the infected condition, $P_{net,1}$.\n$$ P_{net,1} = (P_{c,1} - P_{i,1}) - \\sigma_{1} (\\pi_{c,1} - \\pi_{i,1}) $$\n$$ P_{net,1} = (22 \\text{ mmHg} - 1 \\text{ mmHg}) - 0.4 (18 \\text{ mmHg} - 6 \\text{ mmHg}) $$\n$$ P_{net,1} = 21 \\text{ mmHg} - 0.4 (12 \\text{ mmHg}) $$\n$$ P_{net,1} = 21 \\text{ mmHg} - 4.8 \\text{ mmHg} = 16.2 \\text{ mmHg} $$\n\nNow, we compute the corresponding volumetric flux, $J_{v,1}$.\n$$ J_{v,1} = K_{f,1} \\cdot P_{net,1} $$\n$$ J_{v,1} = (0.015 \\text{ mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{mmHg}^{-1}) \\times (16.2 \\text{ mmHg}) $$\n$$ J_{v,1} = 0.243 \\text{ mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the cumulative transvascular fluid volume, $V_{filtered}$, filtered over a period of $\\Delta t = 60 \\text{ minutes}$.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n***\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Definition of Risk and Relative Risk**\n\nLet $R_1$ be the true risk of in-hospital mortality in the pregnant group and $R_0$ be the true risk in the nonpregnant group. The risk is defined as the probability of the event. Based on the provided data, we can estimate these risks using the observed proportions.\n\nThe estimated risk in the exposed (pregnant) group is the proportion of deaths:\n$$ \\widehat{R}_1 = \\frac{a}{n_1} $$\nThe estimated risk in the unexposed (nonpregnant) group is:\n$$ \\widehat{R}_0 = \\frac{c}{n_0} $$\nThe relative risk ($RR$) is defined as the ratio of the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group. The estimated relative risk, $\\widehat{RR}$, is therefore:\n$$ \\widehat{RR} = \\frac{\\widehat{R}_1}{\\widehat{R}_0} = \\frac{a/n_1}{c/n_0} $$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Variance of the Log-Relative Risk**\n\nTo construct a confidence interval, we work with the natural logarithm of the relative risk, $\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$, because its sampling distribution is more closely approximated by a normal distribution, especially in smaller samples.\n$$ \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\widehat{R}_1}{\\widehat{R}_0}\\right) = \\ln(\\widehat{R}_1) - \\ln(\\widehat{R}_0) $$\nThe number of deaths, $a$, in the pregnant group is a random variable assumed to follow a binomial distribution, $a \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n_1, R_1)$. The variance of the estimated risk $\\widehat{R}_1 = a/n_1$ is:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\widehat{R}_1) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{a}{n_1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{n_1^2} \\text{Var}(a) = \\frac{1}{n_1^2} [n_1 R_1 (1-R_1)] = \\frac{R_1(1-R_1)}{n_1} $$\nSimilarly, for the nonpregnant group, $c \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n_0, R_0)$, and the variance of $\\widehat{R}_0 = c/n_0$ is:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\widehat{R}_0) = \\frac{R_0(1-R_0)}{n_0} $$\nWe use the delta method to find the approximate variance of $\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$. The function of interest is $g(\\widehat{R}_1, \\widehat{R}_0) = \\ln(\\widehat{R}_1) - \\ln(\\widehat{R}_0)$. For large samples, the variance of a function of independent random variables is approximated by:\n$$ \\text{Var}(g(\\widehat{R}_1, \\widehat{R}_0)) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial R_1}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(\\widehat{R}_1) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial R_0}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(\\widehat{R}_0) $$\nThe partial derivatives of $g$ are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial R_1} = \\frac{1}{R_1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial R_0} = -\\frac{1}{R_0} $$\nSubstituting these derivatives and the variances of $\\widehat{R}_1$ and $\\widehat{R}_0$ into the formula, we get the variance of the log-relative risk:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}\\right)^2 \\frac{R_1(1-R_1)}{n_1} + \\left(-\\frac{1}{R_0}\\right)^2 \\frac{R_0(1-R_0)}{n_0} $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) \\approx \\frac{1-R_1}{n_1 R_1} + \\frac{1-R_0}{n_0 R_0} $$\nIn practice, the true risks $R_1$ and $R_0$ are unknown. For large samples (asymptotic reasoning), we can substitute their consistent estimators $\\widehat{R}_1 = a/n_1$ and $\\widehat{R}_0 = c/n_0$ to obtain an estimated variance:\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\frac{1-\\widehat{R}_1}{n_1 \\widehat{R}_1} + \\frac{1-\\widehat{R}_0}{n_0 \\widehat{R}_0} = \\frac{1-a/n_1}{n_1(a/n_1)} + \\frac{1-c/n_0}{n_0(c/n_0)} $$\nThis expression simplifies nicely:\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\frac{(n_1-a)/n_1}{a} + \\frac{(n_0-c)/n_0}{c} = \\frac{n_1-a}{an_1} + \\frac{n_0-c}{cn_0} $$\nThis can be further rewritten as:\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\left(\\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{n_1}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{c} - \\frac{1}{n_0}\\right) $$\nThis is the desired large-sample variance of the logarithm of the estimated relative risk.
