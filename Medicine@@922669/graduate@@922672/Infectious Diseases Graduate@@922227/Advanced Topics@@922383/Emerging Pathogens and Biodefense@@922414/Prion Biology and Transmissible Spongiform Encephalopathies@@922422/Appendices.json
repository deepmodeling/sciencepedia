This fraction can be formally expressed as the conditional probability of an individual having the $MM$ genotype, given that they are an sCJD case, denoted $P(G_{MM}|C)$.\n\nLet $p_i$ be the frequency of the methionine ($M$) allele and $q_i$ be the frequency of the valine ($V$) allele in subpopulation $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. The problem states that each subpopulation is in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Therefore, the genotype frequencies for subpopulation $i$ are:\n- Frequency of $MM$ genotype: $f_{MM,i} = p_i^2$\n- Frequency of $MV$ genotype: $f_{MV,i} = 2 p_i q_i$\n- Frequency of $VV$ genotype: $f_{VV,i} = q_i^2$\n\nThe meta-population is a weighted composite of the two subpopulations, with weights $w_1 = 0.4$ and $w_2 = 0.6$. The overall frequency of each genotype in the meta-population, denoted $F_{genotype}$, is the weighted average of the frequencies in the subpopulations:\n$$F_{MM} = w_1 f_{MM,1} + w_2 f_{MM,2} = w_1 p_1^2 + w_2 p_2^2$$\n$$F_{MV} = w_1 f_{MV,1} + w_2 f_{MV,2} = w_1 (2 p_1 q_1) + w_2 (2 p_2 q_2)$$\n$$F_{VV} = w_1 f_{VV,1} + w_2 f_{VV,2} = w_1 q_1^2 + w_2 q_2^2$$\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\n- Subpopulation $1$: $w_1 = 0.4$, $p_1 = 0.58$.

In this case, the events $D$ (has disease) and $\\neg D$ (does not have disease) form such a partition of the sample space. Therefore, the total probability of a positive test, $P(T)$, can be expressed as:\n$$P(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap \\neg D)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability again for each term, we have $P(T \\cap D) = P(T \\mid D) P(D)$ and $P(T \\cap \\neg D) = P(T \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)$.
