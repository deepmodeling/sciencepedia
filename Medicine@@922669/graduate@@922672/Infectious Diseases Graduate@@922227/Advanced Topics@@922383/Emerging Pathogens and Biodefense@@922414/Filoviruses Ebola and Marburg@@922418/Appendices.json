A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nFirst-order decay kinetics state that the rate of decrease of the concentration of a substance is directly proportional to its current concentration. For the viable virus concentration $C(t)$, this is expressed by the following linear first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k C(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the positive decay constant.\n\nTo find the expression for $C(t)$, we solve this differential equation. This is a separable equation, which we can write as:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{C} = -k \\, dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides. The concentration goes from its initial value $C(0)$ at time $t=0$ to a value $C(t)$ at a later time $t$.\n$$\n\\int_{C(0)}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C'} \\, dC' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt'\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln|C'|]_{C(0)}^{C(t)} = [-kt']_{0}^{t}\n$$\nSince concentration cannot be negative, we can drop the absolute value.\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C(0)) = -kt\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can combine the terms on the left side:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C(0)}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nTo solve for $C(t)$, we exponentiate both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{C(t)}{C(0)} = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\n$$\nC(t) = C(0) \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis is the general solution for first-order decay.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the half-life, $t_{1/2}$. By definition, the half-life is the time at which the concentration has fallen to half of its initial value. Mathematically, at $t = t_{1/2}$, $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C(0)$.\n\nWe substitute this definition into the integrated rate law:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} C(0) = C(0) \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nAssuming the initial concentration $C(0)$ is non-zero, we can divide both sides by $C(0)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\ln(\\exp(-k t_{1/2}))\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$ and $\\ln(\\exp(x)) = x$, we get:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $t_{1/2}$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the half-life of a first-order decay process.\n\nNow we compute the numerical value for $t_{1/2}$ using the given decay constant $k = 0.10 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.10 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}}\n$$\nThe value of the natural logarithm of $2$ is approximately $0.693147...$.\n$$\nt_{1/2} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{0.10} \\ \\mathrm{h} = 6.93147 \\ \\mathrm{h}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested gives:\n$$\nt_{1/2} \\approx 6.93 \\ \\mathrm{h}\n$$\n\n### Qualitative Interpretation\nThe calculated half-life of $6.93$ hours indicates that the quantity of viable Ebola virus on the contaminated surface decreases by $50\\%$ approximately every $7$ hours. This represents a significant environmental persistence. To interpret this in the context of fomite transmission risk, we consider the provided scenario.\n\nThe dose $D(t)$ of virus transferred to a person's mucous membrane via a single touch at time $t$ is given by $D(t) = C(t) \\times A \\times f$.\nAt time $t=0$, the initial dose is:\n$$\nD(0) = C(0) A f = (1.0 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{PFU}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}) \\times (10 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) = 100 \\ \\mathrm{PFU}\n$$\nThe probability of infection from this dose, $P_{\\text{inf}}(0)$, using the exponential model $P_{\\text{inf}}(D) = 1 - \\exp(-\\alpha D)$, is:\n$$\nP_{\\text{inf}}(0) = 1 - \\exp(-(1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{PFU}^{-1}) \\times (100 \\ \\mathrm{PFU})) = 1 - \\exp(-0.1) \\approx 0.095\n$$\nSo, an immediate touch carries approximately a $9.5\\%$ risk of infection.\n\nAfter one half-life, at $t = t_{1/2} \\approx 6.93 \\ \\mathrm{h}$, the concentration is $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C(0)$. The dose transferred is halved:\n$$\nD(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} D(0) = 50 \\ \\mathrm{PFU}\n$$\nThe risk of infection after one half-life is:\n$$\nP_{\\text{inf}}(t_{1/2}) = 1 - \\exp(-(1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{PFU}^{-1}) \\times (50 \\ \\mathrm{PFU})) = 1 - \\exp(-0.05) \\approx 0.049\n$$\nAfter approximately $7$ hours, the risk from a single touch is still substantial, at nearly $5\\%$.\n\nAfter two half-lives ($t \\approx 13.9 \\ \\mathrm{h}$), the concentration is $\\frac{1}{4}C(0)$, the dose is $25 \\ \\mathrm{PFU}$, and the infection risk is $1 - \\exp(-0.025) \\approx 0.025$, or $2.5\\%$.\n\nThe half-life of nearly $7$ hours implies that a contaminated surface remains a potent source of infection for an extended period. Even after a time equivalent to a typical work shift (e.g., $8$ hours), the viral load has not quite halved, and the risk of transmission via a single touch remains significant. This slow decay rate underscores the critical importance of immediate and thorough decontamination protocols for any surfaces potentially contaminated with Ebola virus in a clinical or laboratory setting to mitigate the high risk of fomite-mediated transmission.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of molecular virology and immunology, well-posed with all necessary information for a unique solution, and presented in an objective, formal manner. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies in the setup.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts: first, a quantitative derivation of the change in glycoprotein stoichiometry, and second, an immunological interpretation of this change.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Stoichiometric Change**\n\nThe problem defines protein abundance as proportional to its messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance, translation efficiency, and trafficking probability. The mRNA abundance for each glycoprotein species is determined by the probability of the corresponding transcriptional editing event.\n\nLet $A_{sGP}$ be the relative abundance of secreted glycoprotein (sGP) and $A_{GP_{1,2}}$ be the relative abundance of membrane-bound glycoprotein ($GP_{1,2}$).\nThe unedited transcript (probability $\\pi_{0}$) yields sGP. The transcript with one adenosine insertion (probability $\\pi_{1}$) yields $GP_{1,2}$.\nTheir abundances can be expressed as:\n$$ A_{sGP} \\propto \\pi_{0} \\cdot k_{s} \\cdot r_{s} $$\n$$ A_{GP_{1,2}} \\propto \\pi_{1} \\cdot k_{m} \\cdot r_{m} $$\nwhere $k_{s}$ and $k_{m}$ are the translation efficiencies, and $r_{s}$ and $r_{m}$ are the trafficking probabilities for sGP and $GP_{1,2}$, respectively.\n\nThe stoichiometry of secreted versus membrane-bound glycoproteins is the ratio $R = \\frac{A_{sGP}}{A_{GP_{1,2}}}$. The proportionality constant cancels out in the ratio:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\pi_{0} \\cdot k_{s} \\cdot r_{s}}{\\pi_{1} \\cdot k_{m} \\cdot r_{m}} $$\n\nWe calculate this ratio for both the baseline and shifted conditions.\n\n**Baseline Condition:**\nThe given parameters are: $\\pi_{0} = 0.70$, $\\pi_{1} = 0.25$, $k_{s} = 1.00$, $k_{m} = 0.80$, $r_{s} = 1.00$, and $r_{m} = 1.00$.\nThe baseline stoichiometric ratio, $R_{base}$, is:\n$$ R_{base} = \\frac{0.70 \\times 1.00 \\times 1.00}{0.25 \\times 0.80 \\times 1.00} = \\frac{0.70}{0.20} = 3.5 $$\n\n**Shifted Condition:**\nThe new transcriptional probabilities are $\\pi_{0}' = 0.85$ and $\\pi_{1}' = 0.13$. All other parameters remain unchanged.\nThe shifted stoichiometric ratio, $R_{shift}$, is:\n$$ R_{shift} = \\frac{0.85 \\times 1.00 \\times 1.00}{0.13 \\times 0.80 \\times 1.00} = \\frac{0.85}{0.104} \\approx 8.173 $$\n\n**Change in Stoichiometry:**\nThe problem asks for the change from baseline to the shifted condition. We compute the fold change, which is the ratio of the new stoichiometry to the old stoichiometry:\n$$ \\text{Fold Change} = \\frac{R_{shift}}{R_{base}} = \\frac{8.173}{3.5} \\approx 2.335 $$\nThus, the stoichiometry of secreted sGP to membrane-bound $GP_{1,2}$ increases by a factor of approximately $2.3$. This is reasonably described as \"approximately $2$-fold\".\n\n**Part 2: Immunological Consequence**\n\nThe calculation shows a significant increase in the relative abundance of secreted sGP compared to the membrane-bound $GP_{1,2}$. The problem statement provides the necessary first principles for immunological interpretation:\n1.  Neutralizing antibodies predominantly target $GP_{1,2}$ on virions and infected cells. This is the protective target.\n2.  sGP is secreted and binds to glycoprotein-specific antibodies. This identifies sGP as a potential decoy or \"antigenic sponge.\"\n\nWith an increased sGP : $GP_{1,2}$ ratio, the immune system, upon producing glycoprotein-specific antibodies (such as immunoglobulin G, or IgG), will encounter a much larger concentration of soluble sGP decoys in the extracellular environment for every one $GP_{1,2}$ target on a cell or virion surface. These antibodies will bind to the abundant sGP, forming immune complexes in the plasma. This process effectively sequesters the antibodies, reducing the concentration of free antibodies available to bind to and neutralize virions or target infected cells for destruction. The consequence is a delay in, or impairment of, an effective neutralizing immune response.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The shift increases the secreted-to-membrane glycoprotein stoichiometry by approximately 2-fold and would be expected to sequester glycoprotein-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), delaying effective virion neutralization.**\n- Stoichiometry Calculation: The statement that the stoichiometry increases by approximately $2$-fold is consistent with our calculated fold increase of $2.335$.\n- Immunological Reasoning: The reasoning that this shift leads to the sequestration of antibodies (like IgG) by the decoy sGP, thereby delaying effective neutralization, is a direct and logical consequence of the derived stoichiometric change and the provided first principles.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The shift decreases the secreted-to-membrane glycoprotein stoichiometry by approximately 2-fold and would be expected to enhance neutralization by increasing virion antigen density.**\n- Stoichiometry Calculation: This is factually incorrect. The calculation shows an increase, not a decrease.\n- Immunological Reasoning: The conclusion is predicated on a false premise. An increase in a secreted decoy antigen would impair, not enhance, neutralization.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The shift increases the secreted-to-membrane glycoprotein stoichiometry by approximately 2-fold and would be expected to enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against infected cells via Fc receptor binding to secreted glycoprotein.**\n- Stoichiometry Calculation: The statement of a $\\approx 2$-fold increase is correct.\n- Immunological Reasoning: This reasoning is flawed. ADCC is triggered when immune cells (e.g., NK cells) use their Fc receptors to bind the Fc portion of antibodies that are themselves bound to antigens expressed on a *target cell's surface*. Antibodies binding to *secreted* sGP form immune complexes in the extracellular fluid; they are not bound to the infected cell and therefore cannot mediate ADCC against it. In fact, by sequestering antibodies, the increased sGP would inhibit ADCC against infected cells by reducing the number of antibodies available to bind to surface $GP_{1,2}$.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The shift has no effect on stoichiometry because the number of insertions does not change protein identity, and would be expected to have no immunological consequence.**\n- Stoichiometry Calculation: This statement is false. Our calculation explicitly shows a change in stoichiometry from $3.5$ to $\\approx 8.17$.\n- Immunological Reasoning: The premise \"the number of insertions does not change protein identity\" is directly contradicted by the problem statement, which specifies that $0$ and $1$ insertion lead to different proteins (sGP vs. $GP_{1,2}$). Consequently, the conclusion of no immunological effect is invalid.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4643349"}]}
