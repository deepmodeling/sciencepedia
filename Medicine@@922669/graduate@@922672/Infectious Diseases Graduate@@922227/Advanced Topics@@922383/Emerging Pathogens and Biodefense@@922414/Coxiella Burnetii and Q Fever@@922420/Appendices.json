It is based on the standard single-hit model of infection, a cornerstone of quantitative microbial risk assessment. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided to derive a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nLet $N$ be the random variable representing the number of viable *Coxiella burnetii* organisms deposited in the lower respiratory tract. According to the problem statement, $N$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $D$. The probability mass function (PMF) of $N$ is given by:\n$$P(N=n) = \\frac{D^n \\exp(-D)}{n!}, \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$$\nLet $k$ be the probability that a single deposited organism successfully establishes an infection. The establishments of infection by different organisms are independent events. Infection occurs if at least one organism establishes infection, which is denoted by the event $I$.\n\nIt is more tractable to first calculate the probability of the complementary event, that no infection occurs ($I^c$). No infection occurs if and only if all $N$ deposited organisms fail to establish infection.\n\nLet's condition on the number of deposited organisms being $n$. The probability that a single organism fails to establish infection is $(1-k)$. Since the events are independent for each of the $n$ organisms, the probability that all $n$ of them fail to establish infection is $(1-k)^n$.\n$$P(I^c | N=n) = (1-k)^n$$\nNote that if $n=0$, meaning no organisms are deposited, the probability of no infection is $(1-k)^0 = 1$, which is logically correct.\n\nTo find the total probability of no infection, $P(I^c)$, we use the law of total probability by summing over all possible values of $n$:\n$$P(I^c) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} P(I^c | N=n) P(N=n)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the conditional probability and the PMF of the Poisson distribution:\n$$P(I^c) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (1-k)^n \\frac{D^n \\exp(-D)}{n!}$$\nWe can rearrange the terms in the sum:\n$$P(I^c) = \\exp(-D) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{((1-k)D)^n}{n!}$$\nThe summation term is the Taylor series expansion for the exponential function, $\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^j}{j!} = \\exp(x)$. In this case, $x = (1-k)D$.\nTherefore, the summation evaluates to $\\exp((1-k)D)$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $P(I^c)$:\n$$P(I^c) = \\exp(-D) \\exp((1-k)D) = \\exp(-D + (1-k)D) = \\exp(-D + D - kD) = \\exp(-kD)$$\nThe probability of infection, $P(I)$, is the complement of the probability of no infection:\n$$P(I) = 1 - P(I^c)$$\nThis yields the analytical expression for the infection probability as a function of $k$ and $D$:\n$$P(I) = 1 - \\exp(-kD)$$\nThis is the exponential dose-response model.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given values $k=0.05$ and $D=10$.\n$$P(I) = 1 - \\exp(-(0.05)(10))$$\n$$P(I) = 1 - \\exp(-0.5)$$\nUsing a calculator for the value of the exponential term:\n$$\\exp(-0.5) \\approx 0.6065306597$$\n$$P(I) \\approx 1 - 0.6065306597 = 0.3934693403$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $0.3935$.\n\nThe substantial calculated infection probability of approximately $39\\%$ underscores the critical need for stringent enforcement of high-level respiratory protection to minimize aerosol inhalation and thereby reduce the effective dose $D$ and risk of Q fever.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3935}$$", "id": "4636418"}, {"introduction": "Once a patient presents with symptoms suggestive of Q fever, the challenge shifts to diagnosis.

The odds of an event $A$ are defined as $\\text{Odds}(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{1 - P(A)} = \\frac{P(A)}{P(A^c)}$.\nThe pre-test odds of disease are:\n$$\\text{Odds}(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)}$$\nThe post-test odds of disease, given a positive test, are:\n$$\\text{Odds}(D|T) = \\frac{P(D|T)}{P(D^c|T)}$$\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem for both the numerator and the denominator of the post-test odds expression:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T)}$$\n$$P(D^c|T) = \\frac{P(T|D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T)}$$\n\nDividing these two expressions gives:\n$$\\text{Odds}(D|T) = \\frac{P(D|T)}{P(D^c|T)} = \\frac{\\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T)}}{\\frac{P(T|D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T)}} = \\frac{P(T|D)}{P(T|D^c)} \\times \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)}$$\nRecognizing the terms on the right-hand side, we have:\n$$\\text{Odds}(D|T) = \\mathrm{LR}^{+} \\times \\text{Odds}(D)$$\nThis fundamental relationship states that the post-test odds are the pre-test odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio.\n\nNow, we can use the given values to calculate the solution.\nFirst, calculate the pre-test odds from the pre-test probability, $P(D) = 0.15$.\nThe probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$.\n$$\\text{Odds}(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} = \\frac{0.15}{0.85} = \\frac{15}{85} = \\frac{3}{17}$$\n\nNext, calculate the post-test odds using the given positive likelihood ratio, $\\mathrm{LR}^{+} = 8$.\n$$\\text{Odds}(D|T) = \\mathrm{LR}^{+} \\times \\text{Odds}(D) = 8 \\times \\frac{3}{17} = \\frac{24}{17}$$\n\nFinally, convert the post-test odds back to a probability.
