Consider a single infectious individual in a fully susceptible population. The basic reproduction number $R_0$ is defined as the expected number of secondary cases generated by a typical infectious individual in the absence of interventions. The infectious period $T$ is the total duration over which the individual can transmit infection. Assume that, in the absence of intervention, the expected transmission potential per day is constant across the infectious period. Let isolation effectiveness $e$ be the proportionate reduction in transmission achievable on days the individual is isolated (for example, $e=0.7$ means transmission is reduced by $70\\%$ on those days).

The validation confirms the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We can therefore proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nLet the given quantities be represented as follows:\n- $R_0$ is the basic reproduction number, the total expected number of secondary infections from a single case in a susceptible population without interventions.\n- $T$ is the total duration of the infectious period, in days.\n- $e$ is the isolation effectiveness, defined as the proportionate reduction in transmission on days of isolation.\n\nThe problem states a key assumption: the expected transmission potential per day is constant throughout the infectious period $T$. Let us denote this constant daily transmission potential (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated per day) by the symbol $\\beta$.\n\nAccording to its definition, $R_0$ is the sum of transmissions over the entire infectious period. With a constant daily rate $\\beta$ over a period of $T$ days, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$R_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{T} \\beta = \\beta \\cdot T$$\nFrom this equation, we can solve for the daily transmission potential $\\beta$ in terms of the fundamental parameters $R_0$ and $T$:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{R_0}{T}$$\nThis expression gives the expected number of new infections generated on any single day during the infectious period, assuming no control measures are in place.\n\nNext, we model the impact of isolation. The effectiveness $e$ represents the proportionate reduction in transmission. Thus, if a person is isolated on a given day, the number of new cases they generate on that day is reduced by a fraction $e$. The transmission that occurs on an isolated day is $\\beta \\cdot (1-e)$.\n\nThe quantity of interest is the \"expected number of secondary cases averted per isolation day.\" This is defined as the reduction in the expected number of secondary cases on a single day due to the implementation of isolation, compared to the baseline of no isolation. This can be calculated as the difference between the expected cases without isolation and the expected cases with isolation for a single day.\n\nLet $A$ represent the expected number of cases averted per day of isolation.\n$$A = (\\text{Expected cases on a day without isolation}) - (\\text{Expected cases on a day with isolation})$$\nSubstituting the expressions for daily transmission:\n$$A = \\beta - \\beta(1-e)$$\nWe can factor out $\\beta$ to simplify the expression:\n$$A = \\beta (1 - (1-e)) = \\beta (1 - 1 + e) = \\beta e$$\nThis shows that the number of cases averted per day is the daily transmission potential multiplied by the effectiveness of isolation.\n\nTo express $A$ in terms of the initial problem parameters ($R_0$, $T$, and $e$), we substitute the expression we derived for $\\beta$:\n$$A = \\left(\\frac{R_0}{T}\\right)e = \\frac{R_0 e}{T}$$\nThis is the general derived expression for the expected number of secondary cases averted per isolation day.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute the value of this metric for the specific case where $R_0 = 2.5$, $T = 7$ days, and $e = 0.7$. We substitute these numerical values into our derived formula:\n$$A = \\frac{2.5 \\times 0.7}{7}$$\nFirst, we evaluate the product in the numerator:\n$$2.5 \\times 0.7 = 1.75$$\nThen, we perform the division by $T$:\n$$A = \\frac{1.75}{7} = 0.25$$\nThe result is an exact decimal value.

Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe givens can be expressed in probabilistic terms:\n- Prevalence, the prior probability of having the disease, is $p = P(D) = 0.05$.

A regional health authority must allocate a limited stock of ventilators in real time and has publicly announced two candidate triage rules.

Let $N_{A} = 150$ and $N_{B} = 100$ denote the numbers of patients who need ventilation. The number of available ventilators is $V = 120$.\n\nClinical survival probabilities are as follows, conditional on a patient’s group and whether a ventilator is allocated:\n- For Group $A$, survival probability without a ventilator is $p_{0A} = 0.55$ and with a ventilator is $p_{1A} = 0.85$.\n- For Group $B$, survival probability without a ventilator is $p_{0B} = 0.35$ and with a ventilator is $p_{1B} = 0.95$.\n\nAssume each patient’s survival can be modeled as a Bernoulli random variable with the group- and treatment-specific survival probability described above, and assume that the expected number of survivors is the sum of individual survival probabilities. Define the expected lives saved by an allocation as the expected number of survivors under that allocation minus the expected number of survivors if no ventilators were used at all.\n\nConsider two triage rules:\n1.

The expected number of lives saved, $L(v_A, v_B)$, can be expressed as:\n$$L(v_A, v_B) = v_A (p_{1A} - p_{0A}) + v_B (p_{1B} - p_{0B})$$\nThis formula shows that to maximize lives saved, we should prioritize allocating ventilators to the group with the higher marginal survival benefit from receiving one.\n\nLet's calculate the marginal survival benefits ($\\Delta p$) for each group:\n-   Marginal benefit for Group A: $\\Delta p_A = p_{1A} - p_{0A} = 0.85 - 0.55 = 0.30$.\n-   Marginal benefit for Group B: $\\Delta p_B = p_{1B} - p_{0B} = 0.95 - 0.35 = 0.60$.\n\nSince $\\Delta p_B > \\Delta p_A$, each ventilator allocated to Group B saves more expected lives than one allocated to Group A.\n\n**Analysis of Rule $U$ (Utilitarian Maximization)**\nThis rule seeks to maximize $L = 0.30 v_A + 0.60 v_B$.

Rule $U$ is purely utilitarian, maximizing the aggregate health outcome (lives saved) by directing resources to where they are most clinically effective. However, this may result in a distribution that exacerbates existing social inequities, potentially damaging trust. Rule $F$ represents a form of constrained utilitarianism. It accepts a lower total number of lives saved ($\\Delta = 8.4$) as a trade-off to ensure a more equitable distribution and uphold a public commitment to fairness, which is crucial for maintaining the legitimacy of the health authority and ensuring long-term public cooperation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8.400}$$", "id": "4642292"}]}
