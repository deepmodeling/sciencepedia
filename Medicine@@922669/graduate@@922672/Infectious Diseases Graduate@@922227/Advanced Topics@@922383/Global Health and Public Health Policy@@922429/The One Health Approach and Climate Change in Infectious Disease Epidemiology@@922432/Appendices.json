A change in temperature can affect disease incidence directly, but it can also have indirect effects by altering the ecology of vectors or reservoirs. This exercise demonstrates a critical methodological pitfall known as omitted variable bias, showing mathematically how failing to account for an intermediate pathway—such as the effect of temperature on vector abundance—can lead to incorrect conclusions about the direct impact of climate drivers. By deriving the bias analytically, you will gain a deeper appreciation for why the comprehensive view offered by the One Health framework is essential for rigorous quantitative analysis. [@problem_id:4699264]", "problem": "A public-health team applying the One Health approach (integrating human, animal, and environmental health) seeks to quantify the effect of climate variability on infectious disease incidence. Let daily infectious disease incidence be the random variable $I$ (cases per day), ambient mean temperature be the random variable $T$ (degrees), and competent vector abundance be the random variable $V$ (counts). Consider the following scientifically grounded data generating process for a single region and season: the true linear epidemiological model is\n$$\nI \\;=\\; \\alpha \\;+\\; \\beta_{T}\\,T \\;+\\; \\beta_{V}\\,V \\;+\\; \\epsilon,\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is an intercept, $\\beta_{T}$ is the direct temperature effect on incidence (e.g., through host susceptibility or pathogen replication), $\\beta_{V}$ is the effect of vector abundance on incidence (e.g., through transmission potential), and $\\epsilon$ is an error term capturing unmodeled determinants of incidence. In keeping with ecological mechanisms under climate change, suppose vector abundance responds linearly to temperature via\n$$\nV \\;=\\; \\gamma\\,T \\;+\\; \\eta,\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ captures climate-driven changes in vector abundance per unit temperature and $\\eta$ captures other ecological drivers (e.g., land use, host animal populations) not linearly related to $T$.\n\nAssume the following conditions, consistent with standard regression exogeneity in epidemiology: $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon]=0$, $\\mathbb{E}[\\eta]=0$, $\\operatorname{Cov}(T,\\epsilon)=0$, and $\\operatorname{Cov}(T,\\eta)=0$, with $\\operatorname{Var}(T)0$.

Express your final answer as a single closed-form symbolic expression involving only $\\beta_{V}$ and $\\gamma$. No numerical approximation is required; do not include any units in your final expression.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the expected bias of a naïve Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator. The analyst performs a simple linear regression of infectious disease incidence ($I$) on temperature ($T$), omitting the mediating variable of vector abundance ($V$). The naïve estimator, which we will denote $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{naïve}}$, is the slope coefficient from this regression. We are asked to find the expected bias, defined as $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{naïve}}] - \\beta_{T}$, where $\\beta_{T}$ is the true direct effect of temperature on incidence.\n\nUnder the standard assumptions of OLS, the sample estimator $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{naïve}}$ is a consistent estimator of the population slope parameter. This population parameter is given by the ratio of the covariance of the two variables to the variance of the independent variable. Therefore, the expected value of the naïve estimator converges in probability to this population value. We can write:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{naïve}}] = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(T, I)}{\\operatorname{Var}(T)}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $\\operatorname{Var}(T)  0$, so this expression is well-defined.\n\nTo find the expected value, we must first express the covariance term, $\\operatorname{Cov}(T, I)$, using the true underlying data generating process. The problem provides the true linear epidemiological model for $I$:\n$$\nI = \\alpha + \\beta_{T}\\,T + \\beta_{V}\\,V + \\epsilon\n$$\nWe substitute this expression for $I$ into the covariance formula:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(T, I) = \\operatorname{Cov}(T, \\alpha + \\beta_{T}\\,T + \\beta_{V}\\,V + \\epsilon)\n$$\nUsing the properties of the covariance operator, specifically its linearity in the second argument, we can expand this expression:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(T, I) = \\operatorname{Cov}(T, \\alpha) + \\operatorname{Cov}(T, \\beta_{T}\\,T) + \\operatorname{Cov}(T, \\beta_{V}\\,V) + \\operatorname{Cov}(T, \\epsilon)\n$$\nThis can be simplified term by term. First, the covariance of a random variable with a constant ($\\alpha$) is $0$. Second, constants ($\\beta_T$ and $\\beta_V$) can be factored out of the covariance. This yields:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(T, I) = 0 + \\beta_{T}\\operatorname{Cov}(T, T) + \\beta_{V}\\operatorname{Cov}(T, V) + \\operatorname{Cov}(T, \\epsilon)\n$$\nBy definition, $\\operatorname{Cov}(T, T) = \\operatorname{Var}(T)$. The problem also provides the exogeneity assumption that $\\operatorname{Cov}(T, \\epsilon) = 0$. Applying these simplifications gives:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(T, I) = \\beta_{T}\\operatorname{Var}(T) + \\beta_{V}\\operatorname{Cov}(T, V)\n$$\nNow, we substitute this back into the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{naïve}}]$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{naïve}}] = \\frac{\\beta_{T}\\operatorname{Var}(T) + \\beta_{V}\\operatorname{Cov}(T, V)}{\\operatorname{Var}(T)}\n$$\nDistributing the denominator, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{naïve}}] = \\frac{\\beta_{T}\\operatorname{Var}(T)}{\\operatorname{Var}(T)} + \\frac{\\beta_{V}\\operatorname{Cov}(T, V)}{\\operatorname{Var}(T)} = \\beta_{T} + \\beta_{V}\\left(\\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(T, V)}{\\operatorname{Var}(T)}\\right)\n$$\nThis reveals that the expected value of the naïve estimator is the true direct effect $\\beta_T$ plus a bias term. This bias term is the product of the true coefficient of the omitted variable, $\\beta_V$, and the coefficient from an auxiliary regression of the omitted variable $V$ on the included variable $T$.\n\nTo finalize the expression, we must evaluate the term $\\operatorname{Cov}(T, V)$. The problem provides the relationship between vector abundance $V$ and temperature $T$:\n$$\nV = \\gamma\\,T + \\eta\n$$\nWe compute the covariance of $T$ with $V$ using this relationship:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(T, V) = \\operatorname{Cov}(T, \\gamma\\,T + \\eta)\n$$\nUsing the linearity of covariance again:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(T, V) = \\operatorname{Cov}(T, \\gamma\\,T) + \\operatorname{Cov}(T, \\eta) = \\gamma\\operatorname{Cov}(T, T) + \\operatorname{Cov}(T, \\eta)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\operatorname{Cov}(T, T) = \\operatorname{Var}(T)$ and using the given assumption $\\operatorname{Cov}(T, \\eta) = 0$, we find:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(T, V) = \\gamma\\operatorname{Var}(T) + 0 = \\gamma\\operatorname{Var}(T)\n$$\nNow, we can substitute this result into our expression for $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{naïve}}]$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{naïve}}] = \\beta_{T} + \\beta_{V}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma\\operatorname{Var}(T)}{\\operatorname{Var}(T)}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\operatorname{Var}(T)  0$, the $\\operatorname{Var}(T)$ terms cancel out:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{naïve}}] = \\beta_{T} + \\beta_{V}\\gamma\n$$\nThe problem asks for the expected bias of the naïve estimator relative to the true $\\beta_{T}$. The bias is defined as the difference between the expected value of the estimator and the true parameter value:\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{naïve}}] - \\beta_{T}\n$$\nSubstituting our result for $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{naïve}}]$:\n$$\n\\text{Bias} = (\\beta_{T} + \\beta_{V}\\gamma) - \\beta_{T} = \\beta_{V}\\gamma\n$$\nThis is the classic formula for omitted variable bias. In this context, the bias arises because the naïve regression of $I$ on $T$ fails to account for the indirect causal pathway where temperature affects vector abundance ($T \\to V$), which in turn affects disease incidence ($V \\to I$). The naïve estimator incorrectly absorbs this indirect effect ($\\beta_{V}\\gamma$) into the estimate of the direct effect ($\\beta_{T}$). The resulting bias is precisely the magnitude of this omitted indirect effect.

The transmission cycle involves two stages: human-to-mosquito and mosquito-to-human. We derive $R_0$ by modeling the expected number of transmissions at each stage, starting from a single primary human case.\n\nLet us define the following components:\n$N_{M \\leftarrow H}$: The expected number of mosquitoes infected by a single infectious human during their entire infectious period.\n$N_{H \\leftarrow M}$: The expected number of humans infected by a single newly infected mosquito during its entire lifespan.\n\nThe basic reproduction number is the product of these two quantities:\n$$R_0 = N_{M \\leftarrow H} \\times N_{H \\leftarrow M}$$\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of $N_{M \\leftarrow H}$ (Human-to-Mosquito Transmission)**\nAn infectious human remains infectious for an average duration of $1/\\gamma$ days, as the recovery rate is $\\gamma$.\nThe number of female mosquitoes per human is $m$.
