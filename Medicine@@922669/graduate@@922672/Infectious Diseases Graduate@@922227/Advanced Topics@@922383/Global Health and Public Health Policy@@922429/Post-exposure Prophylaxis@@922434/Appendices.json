I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary goal is to maintain the average steady-state drug concentration, $C_{\\text{ss,avg}}$, constant despite the change in renal function. The initial state is the reference state (healthy kidney function) and the new state is the one with impaired kidney function.\nThus, we must have:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,avg,new}} = C_{\\text{ss,avg,ref}}$$\nUsing the given formula, $C_{\\text{ss,avg}}=\\dfrac{F\\cdot D}{CL\\cdot \\tau}$, and applying it to the new and reference states:\n$$\\dfrac{F\\cdot D}{CL_{\\text{new}}\\cdot \\tau_{\\text{new}}} = \\dfrac{F\\cdot D}{CL_{\\text{ref}}\\cdot \\tau_{\\text{old}}}$$\nThe dose $D$ and bioavailability $F$ are assumed to be constant. Therefore, we can simplify the equation to:\n$$CL_{\\text{new}}\\cdot \\tau_{\\text{new}} = CL_{\\text{ref}}\\cdot \\tau_{\\text{old}}$$\nThe problem asks for the dosing interval adjustment factor, $\\phi$, defined as $\\phi = \\dfrac{\\tau_{\\text{new}}}{\\tau_{\\text{old}}}$. Rearranging the previous equation gives the expression for $\\phi$:\n$$\\phi = \\dfrac{\\tau_{\\text{new}}}{\\tau_{\\text{old}}} = \\dfrac{CL_{\\text{ref}}}{CL_{\\text{new}}}$$\nThis expression for $\\phi$ is the first part of the required derivation.\n\nNext, we must find an expression for $CL_{\\text{new}}$ in terms of $CL_{\\text{ref}}$, $f_R$, and the $eGFR$ values.\nTotal clearance is the sum of renal and non-renal clearance: $CL = CL_{\\text{renal}} + CL_{\\text{nonrenal}}$.\nAt the reference $eGFR_{\\text{ref}}$, we have $CL_{\\text{ref}} = CL_{\\text{renal,ref}} + CL_{\\text{nonrenal}}$.\nThe renal clearance fraction at reference conditions is $f_{R} = \\dfrac{CL_{\\text{renal,ref}}}{CL_{\\text{ref}}}$. From this, we can express the reference renal clearance as $CL_{\\text{renal,ref}} = f_{R} \\cdot CL_{\\text{ref}}$.\nThe non-renal clearance, $CL_{\\text{nonrenal}}$, is assumed to be independent of $eGFR$. We can express it in terms of reference values:\n$$CL_{\\text{nonrenal}} = CL_{\\text{ref}} - CL_{\\text{renal,ref}} = CL_{\\text{ref}} - f_{R} \\cdot CL_{\\text{ref}} = CL_{\\text{ref}}(1 - f_{R})$$\nRenal clearance, $CL_{\\text{renal}}$, is stated to scale linearly with $eGFR$. This implies a direct proportionality:\n$$\\frac{CL_{\\text{renal,new}}}{eGFR} = \\frac{CL_{\\text{renal,ref}}}{eGFR_{\\text{ref}}}$$\nSolving for the new renal clearance, $CL_{\\text{renal,new}}$:\n$$CL_{\\text{renal,new}} = CL_{\\text{renal,ref}} \\left(\\frac{eGFR}{eGFR_{\\text{ref}}}\\right) = (f_{R} \\cdot CL_{\\text{ref}}) \\left(\\frac{eGFR}{eGFR_{\\text{ref}}}\\right)$$\nNow we can write the expression for the new total clearance, $CL_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$CL_{\\text{new}} = CL_{\\text{renal,new}} + CL_{\\text{nonrenal}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived:\n$$CL_{\\text{new}} = \\left(f_{R} \\cdot CL_{\\text{ref}} \\cdot \\frac{eGFR}{eGFR_{\\text{ref}}}\\right) + \\left(CL_{\\text{ref}}(1 - f_{R})\\right)$$\nFactoring out $CL_{\\text{ref}}$:\n$$CL_{\\text{new}} = CL_{\\text{ref}} \\left[ f_{R} \\frac{eGFR}{eGFR_{\\text{ref}}} + 1 - f_{R} \\right] = CL_{\\text{ref}} \\left[ 1 - f_R \\left(1 - \\frac{eGFR}{eGFR_{\\text{ref}}}\\right) \\right]$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $CL_{\\text{new}}$ back into our formula for $\\phi$:\n$$\\phi = \\frac{CL_{\\text{ref}}}{CL_{\\text{new}}} = \\frac{CL_{\\text{ref}}}{CL_{\\text{ref}} \\left[ 1 - f_R \\left(1 - \\frac{eGFR}{eGFR_{\\text{ref}}}\\right) \\right]}$$\n$$\\phi = \\frac{1}{1 - f_R \\left(1 - \\frac{eGFR}{eGFR_{\\text{ref}}}\\right)}$$\nThis is the general derived expression for the dosing interval adjustment factor.\n\nNow, we evaluate this for the specific drugs and conditions given.\nThe eGFR values are $eGFR = 40$ mL/min and $eGFR_{\\text{ref}} = 100$ mL/min. The ratio is:\n$$\\frac{eGFR}{eGFR_{\\text{ref}}} = \\frac{40}{100} = 0.4$$\nSubstituting this value into the expression for $\\phi$:\n$$\\phi = \\frac{1}{1 - f_R (1 - 0.4)} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.6 \\cdot f_R}$$\nWe can now calculate $\\phi$ for TDF and TAF.\n\nFor TDF, the renal clearance fraction is $f_{R,\\text{TDF}} = 0.7$.\n$$\\phi_{\\text{TDF}} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.6 \\cdot (0.7)} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.42} = \\frac{1}{0.58}$$\n\nFor TAF, the renal clearance fraction is $f_{R,\\text{TAF}} = 0.3$.\n$$\\phi_{\\text{TAF}} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.6 \\cdot (0.3)} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.18} = \\frac{1}{0.82}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $r = \\dfrac{\\phi_{\\text{TDF}}}{\\phi_{\\text{TAF}}}$.\n$$r = \\frac{\\phi_{\\text{TDF}}}{\\phi_{\\text{TAF}}} = \\frac{1/0.58}{1/0.82} = \\frac{0.82}{0.58} = \\frac{82}{58} = \\frac{41}{29}$$\nNow we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures.\n$$r = \\frac{41}{29} \\approx 1.4137931...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$r \\approx 1.414$$\nThis ratio indicates that the dosing interval for TDF needs to be extended by a factor that is approximately $1.414$ times larger than the corresponding extension factor for TAF, under the same degree of renal impairment, to maintain the same average drug exposure.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is defined as the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction (ARR). The ARR is the difference between the probability of infection without the intervention and the probability of infection with the intervention.\nLet $R_0$ be the baseline probability of HIV infection per exposure without PEP, and let $R_{\\mathrm{PEP}}$ be the average probability of infection for an individual prescribed PEP.\nThe absolute risk reduction is then given by:\n$$ \\mathrm{ARR} = R_0 - R_{\\mathrm{PEP}} $$\nAnd the NNT is:\n$$ \\mathrm{NNT} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{ARR}} $$\n\nFirst, we must derive the expression for the baseline risk, $R_0$. Infection can only occur if a sequence of three conditions is met: (1) the source partner is HIV-positive, (2) the source partner is viremic (not virally suppressed), and (3) transmission occurs during the sexual act. The probabilities of these independent events are multiplied.\nThe probability of the partner being HIV-positive is $p_{\\mathrm{HIV}}$.\nGiven the partner is HIV-positive, the probability of them being viremic is $(1 - s)$.\nGiven the partner is HIV-positive and viremic, the probability of transmission is $r_{\\mathrm{act}}$.\nThus, the baseline risk $R_0$ is the product of these probabilities:\n$$ R_0 = P(\\text{Infection without PEP}) = p_{\\mathrm{HIV}} (1-s) r_{\\mathrm{act}} $$\n\nNext, we derive the average risk for an individual prescribed PEP, $R_{\\mathrm{PEP}}$. This risk is a weighted average across the different adherence categories, determined by the law of total probability. Let $I$ be the event of infection. Let $A_c$, $A_p$, and $A_n$ be the events of complete, partial, and no adherence, respectively.\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{PEP}} = P(I | A_c) P(A_c) + P(I | A_p) P(A_p) + P(I | A_n) P(A_n) $$\nThe probabilities of adherence are given as $P(A_c)=a_c$, $P(A_p)=a_p$, and $P(A_n)=a_n$.\nThe conditional probabilities of infection are based on the baseline risk $R_0$ and the corresponding risk reduction for each adherence category. A relative risk reduction of $E$ means the new risk is $R_0(1-E)$.\n-   For complete adherence, the risk reduction is $E$, so the probability of infection is $P(I | A_c) = R_0 (1-E)$.\n-   For partial adherence, the risk reduction is $f_p E$, so the probability of infection is $P(I | A_p) = R_0 (1 - f_p E)$.\n-   For no adherence, the risk reduction is $0$, so the probability of infection is $P(I | A_n) = R_0 (1-0) = R_0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $R_{\\mathrm{PEP}}$:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{PEP}} = [R_0 (1-E)] a_c + [R_0 (1 - f_p E)] a_p + [R_0] a_n $$\nFactoring out the common term $R_0$:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{PEP}} = R_0 [a_c(1-E) + a_p(1-f_p E) + a_n] $$\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{PEP}} = R_0 [a_c - a_c E + a_p - a_p f_p E + a_n] $$\nRecognizing that $a_c + a_p + a_n = 1$:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{PEP}} = R_0 [1 - a_c E - a_p f_p E] $$\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{PEP}} = R_0 [1 - (a_c + a_p f_p)E] $$\n\nNow we can calculate the absolute risk reduction, ARR:\n$$ \\mathrm{ARR} = R_0 - R_{\\mathrm{PEP}} = R_0 - R_0 [1 - (a_c + a_p f_p)E] $$\n$$ \\mathrm{ARR} = R_0 - R_0 + R_0 (a_c + a_p f_p)E $$\n$$ \\mathrm{ARR} = R_0 (a_c + a_p f_p)E $$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_0$:\n$$ \\mathrm{ARR} = p_{\\mathrm{HIV}} (1-s) r_{\\mathrm{act}} (a_c + a_p f_p)E $$\nThis expression represents the expected number of infections averted per PEP course prescribed.\n\nFinally, the NNT is the reciprocal of the ARR:\n$$ \\mathrm{NNT} = \\frac{1}{p_{\\mathrm{HIV}} (1-s) r_{\\mathrm{act}} (a_c + a_p f_p)E} $$\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\n-   $p_{\\mathrm{HIV}} = 0.15$\n-   $s = 0.70$\n-   $r_{\\mathrm{act}} = 0.0138$\n-   $a_c = 0.60$\n-   $a_p = 0.25$\n-   $f_p = 0.50$\n-   $E = 0.80$\n\nFirst, compute the terms in the denominator:\nThe baseline risk component: $p_{\\mathrm{HIV}} (1-s) r_{\\mathrm{act}} = 0.15 \\times (1 - 0.70) \\times 0.0138 = 0.15 \\times 0.30 \\times 0.0138 = 0.000621$.\nThe average efficacy component: $(a_c + a_p f_p)E = (0.60 + 0.25 \\times 0.50) \\times 0.80 = (0.60 + 0.125) \\times 0.80 = 0.725 \\times 0.80 = 0.58$.\n\nThe absolute risk reduction is the product of these two components:\n$$ \\mathrm{ARR} = 0.000621 \\times 0.58 = 0.00036018 $$\n\nThe NNT is the reciprocal of the ARR:\n$$ \\mathrm{NNT} = \\frac{1}{0.00036018} \\approx 2776.3895... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\mathrm{NNT} \\approx 2780 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2780}$$", "id": "4682958"}]}
