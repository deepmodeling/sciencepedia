It presents a standard scenario in clinical epidemiology and evidence-based medicine, requiring the application of Bayes' theorem to update a probability based on new evidence. The provided values for pretest probability, sensitivity, and specificity are realistic for a diagnostic test in a specific clinical setting. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data provided, and contains no internal contradictions or ambiguous terminology. The requirement to derive the result from core probability definitions is a standard pedagogical approach. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\nVerdict: The problem is valid.\n\nSolution Derivation\n\nThe task is to compute the post-test probability of disease given a positive test result, which is a conditional probability. Let us define the following events:\n- $D$: The event that the traveler has brucellosis.\n- $D^c$: The event that the traveler does not have brucellosis.\n- $T^+$: The event that the Rose Bengal test result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the Rose Bengal test result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n- The pretest probability of disease: $P(D) = 0.05$.\n- The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present: $P(T^+ | D) = 0.85$.\n- The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent: $P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95$.\n\nOur goal is to calculate the post-test probability of disease given a positive test result, which is denoted by $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nAccording to the definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T^+)$, is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. Using the definition of conditional probability again, this can be expressed as:\n$$P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D)$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. This can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: the person has the disease and tests positive, or the person does not have the disease and tests positive. Using the law of total probability, we can expand $P(T^+)$ as:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nWe need the values for $P(D^c)$ and $P(T^+ | D^c)$.\nThe probability of not having the disease is the complement of having the disease:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$$\n\nThe term $P(T^+ | D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given the absence of disease. This is also known as the false positive rate. It is the complement of the specificity, $P(T^- | D^c)$, because for a person without the disease, the test can only be positive or negative.\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nNow we can substitute these components back into the expression for $P(D | T^+)$, which is the formal statement of Bayes' theorem for this case:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}$$\n\nWe can now substitute the numerical values into this formula.\nNumerator:\n$$P(T^+ | D) P(D) = (0.85) \\times (0.05) = 0.0425$$\n\nDenominator:\n$$P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) = (0.85 \\times 0.05) + (0.05 \\times 0.95)$$\n$$= 0.0425 + 0.0475$$\n$$= 0.0900$$\n\nFinally, we compute the post-test probability:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{0.0425}{0.0900} = \\frac{425}{900} = \\frac{17}{36}$$\n\nTo provide the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\\frac{17}{36} \\approx 0.472222...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.4722$.\n\nThus, the post-test probability of the traveler having brucellosis after a positive Rose Bengal test is approximately $0.4722$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4722}$$", "id": "4701282"}, {"introduction": "Just as a positive test increases suspicion, a negative test should decrease it.

It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with a quantitative solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Derivation of Post-Test Probability\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has strongyloidiasis, and $D^c$ be the event that he does not.\nLet $T_{ELISA+}$ be a positive ELISA result, and $T_{Stool-}$ be a negative result from triplicate stool exams.\n\nWe are given:\n- Pretest probability: $P(D) = 0.30$. Therefore, $P(D^c) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\n- ELISA parameters: $P(T_{ELISA+}|D) = Se_{ELISA} = 0.90$ and $P(T_{ELISA-}|D^c) = Sp_{ELISA} = 0.95$.\n- Stool exam parameters: $P(T_{Stool+}|D) = Se_{Stool} = 0.70$ and $P(T_{Stool-}|D^c) = Sp_{Stool} = 0.99$.\n\nWe need to calculate the final probability $P(D|T_{ELISA+}, T_{Stool-})$. We will do this in two steps, assuming the tests are conditionally independent given the disease status.\n\n**Part 1: Update the probability with the positive ELISA result.**\n\nFirst, we calculate the posterior probability of disease given the positive ELISA, $P(D|T_{ELISA+})$.\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D|T_{ELISA+}) = \\frac{P(T_{ELISA+}|D)P(D)}{P(T_{ELISA+})}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T_{ELISA+})$, is the total probability of a positive test:\n$$P(T_{ELISA+}) = P(T_{ELISA+}|D)P(D) + P(T_{ELISA+}|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nWe need $P(T_{ELISA+}|D^c) = 1 - P(T_{ELISA-}|D^c) = 1 - Sp_{ELISA} = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n$$P(T_{ELISA+}) = (0.90)(0.30) + (0.05)(0.70) = 0.27 + 0.035 = 0.305$$\nNow we can calculate the posterior probability:\n$$P(D|T_{ELISA+}) = \\frac{0.27}{0.305} \\approx 0.8852$$\nSo, after the positive ELISA, the probability of infection has increased from $30\\%$ to approximately $88.5\\%$. This will be our new prior probability, let's call it $P'(D)$.\n$$P'(D) = 0.8852 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad P'(D^c) = 1 - 0.8852 = 0.1148$$\nAlternatively, the positive likelihood ratio for the ELISA is $LR+ = \\frac{Se_{ELISA}}{1-Sp_{ELISA}} = \\frac{0.90}{0.05} = 18$.\nPretest odds = $\\frac{0.30}{0.70} = \\frac{3}{7}$.\nPost-test odds = Pretest odds $\\times LR+ = \\frac{3}{7} \\times 18 = \\frac{54}{7}$.\nPost-test probability = $\\frac{\\text{Post-test odds}}{1 + \\text{Post-test odds}} = \\frac{54/7}{1 + 54/7} = \\frac{54/7}{61/7} = \\frac{54}{61} \\approx 0.8852$, or $88.5\\%$.\n\n**Part 2: Update the new probability with the negative stool exam result.**\n\nNow we use the result of the negative stool exam, $T_{Stool-}$, to update our new probability $P'(D)$. We want to find $P(D|T_{ELISA+}, T_{Stool-}) = P'(D|T_{Stool-})$.\nUsing Bayes' theorem again:\n$$P'(D|T_{Stool-}) = \\frac{P(T_{Stool-}|D)P'(D)}{P'(T_{Stool-})}$$\nWe need the probabilities of a negative stool exam given disease status:\n- $P(T_{Stool-}|D) = 1 - Se_{Stool} = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30$. (This is the false negative rate).\n- $P(T_{Stool-}|D^c) = Sp_{Stool} = 0.99$. (This is given).\n\nThe denominator is the total probability of a negative stool exam, given the new priors:\n$$P'(T_{Stool-}) = P(T_{Stool-}|D)P'(D) + P(T_{Stool-}|D^c)P'(D^c)$$\n$$P'(T_{Stool-}) = (0.30)(0.8852) + (0.99)(0.1148) \\approx 0.26556 + 0.113652 = 0.379212$$\nNow we can calculate the final posterior probability:\n$$P'(D|T_{Stool-}) = \\frac{0.26556}{0.379212} \\approx 0.7003$$\nTherefore, the final probability of the patient having strongyloidiasis, after considering both test results, is approximately $70\\%$.\n\n### Clinical Interpretation and Management\nA $70\\%$ probability of having chronic strongyloidiasis is very high. Given the established biological reality of autoinfection and the potential for a fatal hyperinfection syndrome if the patient receives corticosteroids, the risk of withholding treatment is unacceptably high. The standard of care is to treat empirically in such high-risk scenarios. The recommended treatment for *Strongyloides stercoralis* is ivermectin.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The positive ELISA has an approximate positive likelihood ratio of $18$, raising the probability from $30\\%$ to about $89\\%$. Three negative stool exams with sensitivity $70\\%$ reduce but do not exclude infection, leaving a probability near $70\\%$. Given autoinfection biology and hyperinfection risk with corticosteroids, empiric ivermectin is indicated despite negative stools.**\n- The calculation of the positive likelihood ratio ($LR+ = 18$) is correct.\n- The calculation of the post-ELISA probability (from $30\\%$ to approximately $89\\%$) is correct ($54/61 \\approx 88.5\\%$).\n- The calculation of the final post-stool exam probability (near $70\\%$) is correct ($70.03\\%$).\n- The clinical interpretation is correct: the negative stool exams do not rule out infection due to modest sensitivity, and the high final probability combined with the risk of hyperinfection mandates empiric treatment with ivermectin.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The ELISA is likely a false positive because its specificity is less than $50\\%$, and three negative stools rule out infection; no treatment is needed.**\n- The statement that the ELISA specificity is less than $50\\%$ is false. The problem explicitly gives the specificity as $0.95$, or $95\\%$.\n- The statement that three negative stools rule out infection is false. The sensitivity is given as $0.70$, meaning there is a $30\\%$ chance of a false negative result ($1 - 0.70 = 0.30$) in an infected person. Our calculation shows the final probability of infection remains high at $70\\%$.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The discordance indicates early acute infection before seroconversion; repeat serology in $2$ weeks and withhold therapy until a rising titer confirms infection.**\n- The patient's travel was $18$ months ago, which is the timeframe for chronic, not early acute, infection.\n- The ELISA result is already positive, so the claim \"before seroconversion\" is a contradiction.\n- The management advice to withhold therapy is dangerous, given the high probability of infection and the planned use of corticosteroids, which could trigger fatal hyperinfection.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The discordance reflects past resolved infection; autoinfection does not occur in humans, so stool negativity proves cure; advise no therapy.**\n- The statement \"autoinfection does not occur in humans\" is medically and biologically false and directly contradicts a premise given in the problem statement. Autoinfection is the key feature that allows *S. stercoralis* to persist for decades.\n- Because of autoinfection, a positive serology in a high-risk individual should not be dismissed as a \"past resolved infection\" without definitive proof of cure.\n- Stool negativity does not prove cure due to poor sensitivity from intermittent larval shedding.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Because ELISA frequently cross-reacts with other helminths, defer therapy and await additional serologies; without symptoms, the risk of hyperinfection is negligible even if Strongyloides is present.**\n- While cross-reactivity is a real phenomenon, the given specificity is high ($95\\%$). More importantly, the statement \"the risk of hyperinfection is negligible even if Strongyloides is present\" is dangerously false. Chronic strongyloidiasis is often asymptomatic, and the trigger for hyperinfection is immunosuppression (e.g., from corticosteroids), not the presence or absence of baseline symptoms. To suggest the risk is negligible is a grave medical error.\n- Deferring therapy in this high-risk situation would be inappropriate.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4701291"}]}
