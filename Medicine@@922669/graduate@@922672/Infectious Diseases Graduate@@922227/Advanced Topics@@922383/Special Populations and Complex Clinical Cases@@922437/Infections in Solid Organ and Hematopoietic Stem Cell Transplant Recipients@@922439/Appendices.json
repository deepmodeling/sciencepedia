Consider the adoption of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis across this cohort.

When fluoroquinolone prophylaxis is implemented, the relative risk for gram-negative bacteremia is $0.45$ and the relative risk for CDI is $1.8$.

The use of antibiotic prophylaxis, its intended benefits (prevention of bacterial infections), and known side effects (such as increased risk of CDI) represent a standard and realistic clinical trade-off. The provided incidence and relative risk values are plausible for an HSCT population.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data points (baseline risks, relative risks) and a clear definition for the final quantity to be calculated (net clinical benefit). The assumptions provided (independence, no competing risks) serve to create a mathematically tractable model. A unique, stable solution can be determined from the givens.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and quantitative language. It is free of subjective claims or bias.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet us denote the risk (cumulative incidence) of an event in the unexposed (no prophylaxis) group as $I_U$ and in the exposed (with prophylaxis) group as $I_E$. The subscripts $GNB$ and $CDI$ will denote gram-negative bacteremia and Clostridioides difficile infection, respectively.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following givens:\n-   Risk of GNB without prophylaxis: $I_{U,GNB} = 0.12$\n-   Risk of CDI without prophylaxis: $I_{U,CDI} = 0.05$\n-   Relative risk of GNB with prophylaxis: $RR_{GNB} = 0.45$\n-   Relative risk of CDI with prophylaxis: $RR_{CDI} = 1.8$\n\nThe relative risk ($RR$) is defined as the ratio of the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group:\n$$RR = \\frac{I_E}{I_U}$$\nTherefore, the risk in the exposed group can be calculated as $I_E = RR \\times I_U$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the risks of GNB and CDI in the group receiving fluoroquinolone prophylaxis.\nFor gram-negative bacteremia:\n$$I_{E,GNB} = RR_{GNB} \\times I_{U,GNB} = 0.45 \\times 0.12 = 0.054$$\nFor Clostridioides difficile infection:\n$$I_{E,CDI} = RR_{CDI} \\times I_{U,CDI} = 1.8 \\times 0.05 = 0.090$$\n\nNext, we calculate the absolute risk reduction ($ARR$) for GNB and the absolute risk increase ($ARI$) for CDI. The $ARR$ is the difference in risk for a beneficial outcome, whereas the $ARI$ is the difference in risk for a harmful outcome.\nThe absolute risk reduction for GNB is:\n$$ARR_{GNB} = I_{U,GNB} - I_{E,GNB} = 0.12 - 0.054 = 0.066$$\nThe absolute risk increase for CDI is:\n$$ARI_{CDI} = I_{E,CDI} - I_{U,CDI} = 0.090 - 0.05 = 0.040$$\n\nNow, we can derive the Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) and the Number Needed to Harm ($NNH$). The $NNT$ is the reciprocal of the $ARR$, and the $NNH$ is the reciprocal of the $ARI$.\nThe $NNT$ to prevent one case of GNB is:\n$$NNT_{GNB} = \\frac{1}{ARR_{GNB}} = \\frac{1}{0.066} \\approx 15.15$$\nConventionally, the $NNT$ is rounded up to the next whole number, as one cannot treat a fraction of a person. Thus, one would need to treat $16$ patients to prevent one GNB event.\n\nThe $NNH$ to cause one case of CDI is:\n$$NNH_{CDI} = \\frac{1}{ARI_{CDI}} = \\frac{1}{0.040} = 25$$\nThis means for every $25$ patients treated with prophylaxis, one additional case of CDI is expected to occur.\n\nFinally, we calculate the net clinical benefit per $1000$ recipients. The problem defines this as the number of GNB events prevented minus the number of CDI events caused in a cohort of $1000$ patients.\nNumber of GNB events prevented per $1000$ recipients:\n$$N_{GNB, \\text{prevented}} = ARR_{GNB} \\times 1000 = 0.066 \\times 1000 = 66$$\nNumber of CDI events caused per $1000$ recipients:\n$$N_{CDI, \\text{caused}} = ARI_{CDI} \\times 1000 = 0.040 \\times 1000 = 40$$\n\nThe net clinical benefit, $B_{net}$, is the difference between these two values:\n$$B_{net} = N_{GNB, \\text{prevented}} - N_{CDI, \\text{caused}} = 66 - 40 = 26$$\nThe problem requires this final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $26$ has two significant figures. To express it with three, we write it as $26.0$.\nThus, the net clinical benefit is $26.0$ events avoided per $1000$ recipients.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{26.0}$$", "id": "4655041"}, {"introduction": "Diagnosing life-threatening infections like invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients is a race against time, where clinical suspicion must be integrated with diagnostic data.

It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution consists of two parts: first, the calculation of the posterior probability of invasive aspergillosis, and second, the application of the decision rule to guide clinical action.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Posterior Probability**\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem in the odds-likelihood formulation, as specified. The relationship is:\n$$\n\\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Pretest Odds} \\times \\text{Likelihood Ratio}\n$$\nThe pretest probability of disease is given as $p = P(D) = 0.30$. The pretest probability of no disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the pretest odds:\n$$\n\\text{Pretest Odds} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} = \\frac{p}{1-p} = \\frac{0.30}{0.70} = \\frac{3}{7}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the likelihood ratio ($\\mathrm{LR}$) for the observed Galactomannan index, $G = 1.8$. The model is given by $\\mathrm{LR}(G) = \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta G)$. Substituting the given constants $\\alpha = -1.2$ and $\\beta = 1.6$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{LR}(G=1.8) = \\exp(-1.2 + (1.6)(1.8))\n$$\nWe calculate the exponent:\n$$\n-1.2 + (1.6)(1.8) = -1.2 + 2.88 = 1.68\n$$\nThus, the likelihood ratio is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{LR}(1.8) = \\exp(1.68)\n$$\nNow, we can compute the posterior odds:\n$$\n\\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Pretest Odds} \\times \\mathrm{LR}(1.8) = \\frac{3}{7} \\times \\exp(1.68)\n$$\nTo obtain the posterior probability, $P_{post} = P(D|G=1.8)$, we use the formula that converts odds to probability:\n$$\nP_{post} = \\frac{\\text{Posterior Odds}}{1 + \\text{Posterior Odds}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for posterior odds:\n$$\nP_{post} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{7} \\exp(1.68)}{1 + \\frac{3}{7} \\exp(1.68)}\n$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $7$:\n$$\nP_{post} = \\frac{3 \\exp(1.68)}{7 + 3 \\exp(1.68)}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\exp(1.68) \\approx 5.365555\n$$\n$$\nP_{post} \\approx \\frac{3 \\times 5.365555}{7 + 3 \\times 5.365555} = \\frac{16.096665}{7 + 16.096665} = \\frac{16.096665}{23.096665} \\approx 0.696923\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the posterior probability is:\n$$\nP_{post} \\approx 0.6969\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Application of the Decision Rule**\n\nThe decision to start empiric therapy is based on a threshold probability, $P_T$, at which the expected harm (or loss) of treating equals the expected harm of not treating (deferring).\n\nThe expected harm of deferring therapy is the harm of a false negative decision ($C_{FN}$) multiplied by the probability that the patient actually has the disease ($P_{post}$):\n$$\nE[\\text{Harm(Defer)}] = C_{FN} \\times P_{post}\n$$\nThe problem states that the expected harm of empiric therapy is a constant value $C_T$. This is a simplification, but we must adhere to the problem's formulation.\n$$\nE[\\text{Harm(Treat)}] = C_{T}\n$$\nThe decision threshold $P_T$ is the probability where these two expected harms are equal:\n$$\nC_{FN} \\times P_T = C_{T}\n$$\nSolving for $P_T$:\n$$\nP_T = \\frac{C_T}{C_{FN}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $C_T = 0.08$ and $C_{FN} = 0.60$:\n$$\nP_T = \\frac{0.08}{0.60} = \\frac{8}{60} = \\frac{2}{15} \\approx 0.1333\n$$\nThe decision rule is to initiate therapy if the posterior probability of disease, $P_{post}$, exceeds this threshold, as this indicates that the expected harm of deferring therapy is greater than the expected harm of treating.\n$$\n\\text{Treat if } P_{post} > P_T\n$$\nWe compare our calculated posterior probability to this threshold:\n$$\nP_{post} \\approx 0.6969\n$$\n$$\nP_T \\approx 0.1333\n$$\nClearly, $0.6969 > 0.1333$.\n\n**Justification:**\nThe calculated posterior probability of invasive aspergillosis, $P_{post} \\approx 0.6969$, is substantially greater than the decision threshold, $P_T \\approx 0.1333$. This means that the expected harm of deferring therapy ($C_{FN} \\times P_{post} \\approx 0.60 \\times 0.6969 \\approx 0.418$) is significantly higher than the expected harm of initiating empiric therapy ($C_T = 0.08$). Therefore, according to the specified Bayes decision rule which aims to minimize expected harm, the posterior probability crosses the decision threshold, and the correct action is to start empiric mold-active antifungal therapy.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6969}\n$$", "id": "4655102"}, {"introduction": "The principle of \"right drug, right dose, right patient\" is paramount in transplant infectious diseases, where many essential antimicrobials have a narrow therapeutic window.

A solution will be furnished.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe primary objective is to determine a valganciclovir prophylaxis regimen for a patient with impaired renal function that maintains a therapeutic exposure comparable to that of a patient with normal renal function. The problem stipulates that to maintain a constant $24$-hour area under the curve ($\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}$), the average daily dose ($\\text{Dose}_{24}$) should be scaled in proportion to the patient's clearance ($Cl$).\n\nThe provided model assumes that systemic clearance is directly proportional to creatinine clearance ($CrCl$). Therefore, to maintain the same $\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}$, the following relationship must hold:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{target},24}}{Cl_{\\text{patient}}} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{ref},24}}{Cl_{\\text{ref}}}\n$$\nGiven $Cl \\propto CrCl$, we can substitute $CrCl$ for $Cl$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{target},24}}{CrCl_{\\text{patient}}} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{ref},24}}{CrCl_{\\text{ref}}}\n$$\nWe can solve for the ideal target average daily dose, $\\text{Dose}_{\\text{target},24}$, for our patient. The given values are:\n- Reference average daily dose, $\\text{Dose}_{\\text{ref},24} = 900$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\n- Reference creatinine clearance, $CrCl_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 60$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n- Patient's creatinine clearance, $CrCl_{\\text{patient}} = 33$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$\n\\text{Dose}_{\\text{target},24} = \\text{Dose}_{\\text{ref},24} \\times \\left(\\frac{CrCl_{\\text{patient}}}{CrCl_{\\text{ref}}}\\right) = 900 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day} \\times \\left(\\frac{33 \\, \\mathrm{mL/min}}{60 \\, \\mathrm{mL/min}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Dose}_{\\text{target},24} = 900 \\times 0.55 = 495 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day}\n$$\nThis calculated target dose of $495$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$ is theoretical and based on the simplified linear scaling model. We must now evaluate the practical, constrained dosing options to find the best fit. The available regimens must use $450$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ tablets. Sensible options and their average daily doses are:\n1.  **Regimen 1**: $450$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ once daily ($\\tau=1$ day). Average daily dose = $450/1 = 450$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\n2.  **Regimen 2**: $450$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ every other day ($\\tau=2$ days). Average daily dose = $450/2 = 225$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\n3.  **Regimen 3**: $450$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ twice weekly. Average daily dose = $(450 \\times 2)/7 \\approx 128.6$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\n4.  **Regimen 4**: $900$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ ($2$ tablets) every other day. Average daily dose = $900/2 = 450$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\n5.  **Regimen 5**: $900$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ ($2$ tablets) twice weekly. Average daily dose = $(900 \\times 2)/7 \\approx 257.1$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\n\nThe calculated target of $495$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$ is closest to the average daily dose of $450$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$ provided by Regimen 1 or 4. However, the problem includes a critical, overriding instruction: \"choose the prophylaxis regimen that aligns with clinical practice for $CrCl$ in the range $25$–$39$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\" The patient's $CrCl$ of $33$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$ falls squarely within this range.\n\nStandard, evidence-based clinical guidelines for valganciclovir prophylaxis dosing recommend a regimen of **$450$ mg every other day** for patients with a $CrCl$ between $25$ and $39$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$. This corresponds to Regimen 2. The discrepancy between the simplified model's result (which points to $450$ mg daily) and the established clinical guideline arises because the model $Cl \\propto CrCl$ is an oversimplification. The true relationship between total ganciclovir clearance ($Cl$) and $CrCl$ includes a non-renal clearance component ($Cl_{\\text{nr}}$), following a linear affine model of the form $Cl = a \\cdot CrCl + Cl_{\\text{nr}}$. The simplified proportionality model ignores the non-zero intercept, leading to an overestimation of the required dose at lower levels of renal function. Clinical guidelines are based on more robust pharmacokinetic modeling and extensive clinical data, which account for this and prioritize patient safety by avoiding potential toxicity. Therefore, adherence to the explicit instruction to follow clinical practice is mandatory.\n\nThe chosen regimen is $450$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ every other day. We now compute the exact average daily administered dose for this regimen.\n$$\n\\text{Average Daily Dose} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}}{\\text{Dosing Interval}} = \\frac{450 \\, \\mathrm{mg}}{2 \\, \\text{days}} = 225 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day}\n$$\n\n### Discussion of Underdosing vs. Overdosing\nThe management of CMV prophylaxis in transplant recipients requires navigating the narrow therapeutic window of ganciclovir to balance efficacy and toxicity. Both underdosing and overdosing carry severe risks.\n\n**Underdosing (Subtherapeutic Exposure)**:\n- **Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Principle**: If the ganciclovir exposure (quantified by $\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}$) falls below the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) required to suppress viral replication, prophylaxis will fail. Ganciclovir's efficacy depends on its intracellular conversion to ganciclovir triphosphate, which competitively inhibits CMV DNA polymerase. Insufficient exposure leads to inadequate levels of the active triphosphate moiety.\n- **Clinical Consequences**: The primary risk of underdosing is **breakthrough CMV disease**. In an immunocompromised solid organ transplant (SOT) or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipient, this can be catastrophic, leading to CMV syndrome (fever, myelosuppression) or severe tissue-invasive disease such as pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, or retinitis, which are associated with high morbidity, graft loss, and mortality.\n- **Secondary Risk**: Subtherapeutic drug concentrations can also promote the development of **antiviral resistance**, as partial selective pressure favors the emergence of CMV strains with mutations in the $UL97$ (phosphotransferase) or $UL54$ (DNA polymerase) genes. Resistant CMV is significantly more difficult and costly to treat.\n\n**Overdosing (Supratherapeutic/Toxic Exposure)**:\n- **PK/PD Principle**: Ganciclovir clearance is predominantly renal. In a patient with reduced $CrCl$ like the one in this problem, a standard dose will lead to drug accumulation, a prolonged elimination half-life, and a dangerously high AUC.\n- **Clinical Consequences**: The dose-limiting toxicity of ganciclovir is **myelosuppression**, stemming from its inhibition of DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow. This manifests clinically as **neutropenia**, and also thrombocytopenia and anemia. Severe neutropenia (Absolute Neutrophil Count $ 500 \\text{ cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$) dramatically increases the patient's risk of life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections. This is particularly perilous in transplant recipients who may already be receiving other myelosuppressive agents (e.g., mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine).\n- **Other Risks**: While less common, overdosing can also contribute to nephrotoxicity and central nervous system side effects.\n\nIn summary, the goal of renal dose adjustment is to maintain the $\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}$ within the therapeutic window, ensuring sufficient exposure for viral suppression while mitigating the risk of dose-dependent toxicities, especially bone marrow suppression. The discrepancy noted between the simple scaling model and established clinical guidelines reflects a conservative approach in practice, which prioritizes the avoidance of severe, potentially fatal toxicity from overdosing.\n\nThe final answer is the average daily dose of the selected regimen.\nThe regimen is $450$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ every $2$ days.\nThe average daily dose is $225$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$. The problem requests four significant figures if rounding is necessary. Since $225$ is an exact integer, it is expressed as $225.0$ to meet this potential requirement.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{225.0}\n$$", "id": "4655039"}]}
