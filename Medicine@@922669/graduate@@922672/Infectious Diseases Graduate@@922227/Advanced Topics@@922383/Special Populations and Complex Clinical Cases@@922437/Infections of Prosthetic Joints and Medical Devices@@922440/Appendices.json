A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\nLet $N(t)$ be the quantity of attached biofilm biomass, measured in CFU, at time $t$ in hours. The rate of change of $N(t)$, $\\frac{dN}{dt}$, is determined by the balance between the rate of bacterial replication and the rate of detachment.\n\nThe growth is described by a constant specific growth rate $r$. This means the per-capita rate of growth is $r$. The total rate of growth for the entire population $N(t)$ is therefore the per-capita rate multiplied by the population size: Rate of Growth $= rN(t)$.\n\nThe detachment is described as a constant first-order process with rate constant $d$. This means the rate of loss is directly proportional to the population size: Rate of Detachment $= dN(t)$.\n\nThe net rate of change of the biofilm population is the rate of growth minus the rate of detachment. This allows us to construct the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN(t) - dN(t)\n$$\nFactoring out $N(t)$, we obtain a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = (r-d)N(t)\n$$\nThis equation is separable. We can rearrange it as:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N} dN = (r-d) dt\n$$\nTo solve for $N(t)$, we integrate both sides. We integrate from the initial state at time $t=0$ with population $N(0)$ to the state at an arbitrary time $t$ with population $N(t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{N(0)}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N'} dN' = \\int_{0}^{t} (r-d) dt'\n$$\nPerforming the integration gives:\n$$\n[\\ln(N')]_{N(0)}^{N(t)} = [(r-d)t']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N(0)) = (r-d)t - 0\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N(0)}\\right) = (r-d)t\n$$\nTo find $N(t)$, we exponentiate both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{N(t)}{N(0)} = \\exp((r-d)t)\n$$\n$$\nN(t) = N(0)\\exp((r-d)t)\n$$\nWe are given the initial condition $N(0) = 10^{3}$. Substituting this into the general solution:\n$$\nN(t) = 10^{3}\\exp((r-d)t)\n$$\nNext, we must find the time $T$ at which the population reaches the mature biofilm threshold, $N_{\\mathrm{m}} = 10^{8}$. We set $N(T) = 10^{8}$ and solve for $T$:\n$$\n10^{8} = 10^{3}\\exp((r-d)T)\n$$\nFirst, divide both sides by $10^{3}$ to isolate the exponential term:\n$$\n\\frac{10^{8}}{10^{3}} = 10^{5} = \\exp((r-d)T)\n$$\nNow, take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides to solve for the exponent:\n$$\n\\ln(10^{5}) = \\ln(\\exp((r-d)T))\n$$\n$$\n5\\ln(10) = (r-d)T\n$$\nIsolating $T$ gives the symbolic expression for the time required:\n$$\nT = \\frac{5\\ln(10)}{r-d}\n$$\nThe problem provides the numerical values for the parameters: $r = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ and $d = 0.005\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.

The total volume in the tube is $V_{tube} = V_{asp} + V_{EDTA}$. The number of cells in this tube originated from the initial volume of aspirate, $V_{asp}$. Let $C_{WBC,asp}$ and $C_{RBC,asp}$ be the cell concentrations in the aspirate *before* addition to the EDTA tube.\nBy conservation of cell number, the number of WBCs is constant:\n$$N_{WBC} = C_{WBC,asp} \\times V_{asp} = C_{WBC,an} \\times (V_{asp} + V_{EDTA})$$\nSolving for the concentration in the undiluted aspirate:\n$$C_{WBC,asp} = C_{WBC,an} \\times \\frac{V_{asp} + V_{EDTA}}{V_{asp}}$$\nSimilarly for RBCs:\n$$C_{RBC,asp} = C_{RBC,an} \\times \\frac{V_{asp} + V_{EDTA}}{V_{asp}}$$\nThe term $\\frac{V_{asp} + V_{EDTA}}{V_{asp}}$ is the dilution factor for the EDTA tube, let's call it $D_{EDTA}$.\n\n**Part (ii): Subtract WBCs attributable to blood contamination**\n\nThe problem states that RBCs in the sample are from blood contamination and introduce WBCs at the same ratio as in peripheral blood. The ratio of WBCs to RBCs in peripheral blood is:\n$$R_{p} = \\frac{C_{WBC,p}}{C_{RBC,p}}$$\nThe concentration of WBCs in the aspirate that is due to this blood contamination, $C_{WBC,contam}$, is proportional to the RBC concentration in the aspirate:\n$$C_{WBC,contam} = C_{RBC,asp} \\times R_{p}$$\nThe true concentration of WBCs from synovial fluid within the aspirate, $C_{WBC,asp,true}$, is the total aspirate WBC count minus the contamination component:\n$$C_{WBC,asp,true} = C_{WBC,asp} - C_{WBC,contam}$$\nSubstituting the expressions from Part (i) and the definitions above:\n$$C_{WBC,asp,true} = \\left(C_{WBC,an} \\times D_{EDTA}\\right) - \\left(C_{RBC,an} \\times D_{EDTA} \\times \\frac{C_{WBC,p}}{C_{RBC,p}}\\right)$$\n$$C_{WBC,asp,true} = D_{EDTA} \\left( C_{WBC,an} - C_{RBC,an} \\times \\frac{C_{WBC,p}}{C_{RBC,p}} \\right)$$\n\n**Part (iii): Correct for dilution by intraarticular saline instillation**\n\nThe concentration $C_{WBC,asp,true}$ exists within the mixed fluid in the joint, which has a total volume of $V_{joint} = V_{nat} + V_{sal}$. These WBCs originated from the native synovial fluid, which had an initial volume $V_{nat}$ and concentration $C_{WBC,nat}$.\nBy conservation of cell number, the total number of native WBCs is constant:\n$$N_{WBC,nat} = C_{WBC,nat} \\times V_{nat}$$\nThis number of cells, when diluted into the volume $V_{joint}$, gives the concentration $C_{WBC,asp,true}$:\n$$C_{WBC,asp,true} = \\frac{N_{WBC,nat}}{V_{joint}} = \\frac{C_{WBC,nat} \\times V_{nat}}{V_{nat} + V_{sal}}$$\nSolving for the original native concentration, $C_{WBC,nat}$:\n$$C_{WBC,nat} = C_{WBC,asp,true} \\times \\frac{V_{nat} + V_{sal}}{V_{nat}}$$\n\n**Combined Calculation**\n\nWe combine the equations from all parts to form a single expression for $C_{WBC,nat}$:\n$$C_{WBC,nat} = \\left( \\frac{V_{nat} + V_{sal}}{V_{nat}} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{V_{asp} + V_{EDTA}}{V_{asp}} \\right) \\times \\left( C_{WBC,an} - C_{RBC,an} \\times \\frac{C_{WBC,p}}{C_{RBC,p}} \\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$V_{nat} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mL}, V_{sal} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{mL}, V_{asp} = 2.80\\,\\mathrm{mL}, V_{EDTA} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n$$C_{WBC,an} = 3.90 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{cells}/\\mu L, C_{RBC,an} = 0.80 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{cells}/\\mu L$$\n$$C_{WBC,p} = 6.50 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{cells}/\\mu L, C_{RBC,p} = 4.70 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{cells}/\\mu L$$\n\n$$C_{WBC,nat} = \\left( \\frac{3.0 + 10.0}{3.0} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{2.80 + 0.20}{2.80} \\right) \\times \\left( 3.90 \\times 10^{3} - (0.80 \\times 10^{6}) \\times \\frac{6.50 \\times 10^{3}}{4.70 \\times 10^{6}} \\right)$$\nFirst, calculate the term for WBCs from blood contamination:\n$$(0.80 \\times 10^{6}) \\times \\frac{6.50 \\times 10^{3}}{4.70 \\times 10^{6}} = 800000 \\times \\frac{6500}{4700000} = 800000 \\times \\frac{6.5}{4700} = \\frac{5200000}{4700} = \\frac{52000}{47} \\approx 1106.383\\,\\mathrm{cells}/\\mu L$$\nNext, calculate the corrected concentration in the analyzer's sample:\n$$C_{WBC,an} - C_{WBC,contam} = 3900 - 1106.383 = 2793.617\\,\\mathrm{cells}/\\mu L$$\nNow, calculate the two dilution factors:\nSaline dilution factor: $D_{sal} = \\frac{13.0}{3.0} \\approx 4.3333$\nEDTA dilution factor: $D_{EDTA} = \\frac{3.00}{2.80} \\approx 1.0714$\nThe combined dilution factor is $D_{total} = D_{sal} \\times D_{EDTA} = \\frac{13.0}{3.0} \\times \\frac{3.00}{2.80} = \\frac{13.0}{2.80} \\approx 4.642857$\nFinally, calculate the native WBC concentration:\n$$C_{WBC,nat} = D_{total} \\times 2793.617 \\approx 4.642857 \\times 2793.617 \\approx 12970.3647\\,\\mathrm{cells}/\\mu L$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$C_{WBC,nat} \\approx 12970\\,\\mathrm{cells}/\\mu L$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12970}$$", "id": "4655462"}, {"introduction": "Successfully treating a biofilm-associated infection hinges on achieving adequate antibiotic exposure at the target site, a challenge given the high drug tolerance of these communities.
