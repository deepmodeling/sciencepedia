The decision rule will be based on a single plasma biomarker, interleukin-6 (IL-6), denoted by the random variable $X$ measured in $\\mathrm{pg}/\\mathrm{mL}$. Assume that, conditional on the true state, $X$ follows Gaussian distributions with equal variance: $X \\mid Y=1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{1}, \\sigma^{2})$ for patients who will develop CRS and $X \\mid Y=0 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{0}, \\sigma^{2})$ for those who will not, with $\\mu_{1} > \\mu_{0}$. Let $p = \\Pr(Y=1)$ be the CRS prevalence in the evaluated cohort. A threshold $t$ is used so that patients with $X \\geq t$ are classified as “high-risk for CRS” and those with $X  t$ as “low-risk.” The hospital quantifies decision harms using a false negative cost $C_{\\mathrm{FN}}$ (missing a future CRS patient) and a false positive cost $C_{\\mathrm{FP}}$ (unnecessary escalation in a non-CRS patient), both measured in the same arbitrary harm units.\n\nStarting strictly from first principles—definitions of sensitivity, specificity, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, and Bayes risk minimization—derive the decision condition that minimizes the expected misclassification harm over all thresholds.

The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Optimal Decision Threshold\n\nThe primary goal is to find the decision threshold $t$ that minimizes the expected total harm from misclassification. This expected harm is the Bayes risk, $R(t)$. The risk is the sum of the expected harm from false positives and false negatives.\n\nLet $\\hat{Y}(x)$ be the classification for a measurement $x$. We classify as \"high-risk\" ($\\hat{Y}=1$) if $x \\geq t$ and \"low-risk\" ($\\hat{Y}=0$) if $x  t$.\n\nA false positive (FP) occurs when a patient does not have the condition ($Y=0$) but is classified as high-risk ($X \\geq t$). The probability of a false positive for a given threshold $t$ is $\\Pr(\\text{FP}, t) = \\Pr(X \\geq t, Y=0) = \\Pr(X \\geq t \\mid Y=0)\\Pr(Y=0)$.\nA false negative (FN) occurs when a patient has the condition ($Y=1$) but is classified as low-risk ($X  t$). The probability of a false negative for a given threshold $t$ is $\\Pr(\\text{FN}, t) = \\Pr(X  t, Y=1) = \\Pr(X  t \\mid Y=1)\\Pr(Y=1)$.\n\nThe total expected harm, or Bayes risk $R(t)$, is the sum of the probabilities of each type of error, weighted by their respective costs:\n$$R(t) = C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\cdot \\Pr(\\text{FP}, t) + C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\cdot \\Pr(\\text{FN}, t)$$\n$$R(t) = C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\cdot \\Pr(X \\geq t \\mid Y=0)\\Pr(Y=0) + C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\cdot \\Pr(X  t \\mid Y=1)\\Pr(Y=1)$$\n\nLet $f_0(x)$ and $f_1(x)$ be the probability density functions (PDFs) for the random variable $X$ conditional on $Y=0$ and $Y=1$, respectively. Given the prevalence $p = \\Pr(Y=1)$, we have $\\Pr(Y=0) = 1-p$. The risk can be written in integral form:\n$$R(t) = C_{\\mathrm{FP}} (1-p) \\int_{t}^{\\infty} f_0(x) \\,dx + C_{\\mathrm{FN}} p \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} f_1(x) \\,dx$$\n\nTo find the threshold $t^{\\ast}$ that minimizes $R(t)$, we differentiate $R(t)$ with respect to $t$ and set the derivative to zero. Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (specifically, Leibniz integral rule):\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{t}^{\\infty} f(x) \\,dx = -f(t)$$\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} f(x) \\,dx = f(t)$$\n\nApplying this to $R(t)$:\n$$\\frac{dR(t)}{dt} = C_{\\mathrm{FP}} (1-p) [-f_0(t)] + C_{\\mathrm{FN}} p [f_1(t)]$$\n\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the optimal threshold $t^{\\ast}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{FN}} p f_1(t^{\\ast}) - C_{\\mathrm{FP}} (1-p) f_0(t^{\\ast}) = 0$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{FN}} p f_1(t^{\\ast}) = C_{\\mathrm{FP}} (1-p) f_0(t^{\\ast})$$\n\nThis can be rearranged into the **likelihood ratio condition**, which is the general decision condition that minimizes Bayes risk:\n$$\\frac{f_1(t^{\\ast})}{f_0(t^{\\ast})} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{FP}}(1-p)}{C_{\\mathrm{FN}}p}$$\nThis is the first required result: the decision condition that minimizes the expected misclassification harm.\n\n### Connection to the ROC Curve\n\nThe Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a plot of the True Positive Rate (TPR) versus the False Positive Rate (FPR) for all possible thresholds $t$.\n-   **True Positive Rate (Sensitivity):** $\\mathrm{TPR}(t) = \\Pr(X \\geq t \\mid Y=1) = \\int_{t}^{\\infty} f_1(x) \\,dx$\n-   **False Positive Rate (1 - Specificity):** $\\mathrm{FPR}(t) = \\Pr(X \\geq t \\mid Y=0) = \\int_{t}^{\\infty} f_0(x) \\,dx$\n\nThe slope of the ROC curve at a point corresponding to a threshold $t$ is given by $\\frac{d(\\mathrm{TPR})}{d(\\mathrm{FPR})}$. Using the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{d(\\mathrm{TPR})}{d(\\mathrm{FPR})} = \\frac{d(\\mathrm{TPR})/dt}{d(\\mathrm{FPR})/dt}$$\n\nWe compute the derivatives with respect to $t$:\n$$\\frac{d(\\mathrm{TPR})}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{t}^{\\infty} f_1(x) \\,dx = -f_1(t)$$\n$$\\frac{d(\\mathrm{FPR})}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{t}^{\\infty} f_0(x) \\,dx = -f_0(t)$$\n\nThus, the slope of the ROC curve at threshold $t$ is:\n$$\\frac{d(\\mathrm{TPR})}{d(\\mathrm{FPR})} = \\frac{-f_1(t)}{-f_0(t)} = \\frac{f_1(t)}{f_0(t)}$$\n\nComparing this with our optimal decision condition, we see that at the optimal threshold $t^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\text{Slope}_{\\text{ROC}}(t^{\\ast}) = \\frac{f_1(t^{\\ast})}{f_0(t^{\\ast})} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{FP}}(1-p)}{C_{\\mathrm{FN}}p}$$\nThis demonstrates that the Bayes-optimal operating point is the point on the ROC curve where the tangent line has a slope equal to the cost-prevalence ratio $\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{FP}}(1-p)}{C_{\\mathrm{FN}}p}$.\n\n### Closed-Form Solution for $t^{\\ast}$ under the Gaussian Model\n\nWe now substitute the Gaussian PDFs into the likelihood ratio condition. The PDFs are:\n$$f_0(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$$\n$$f_1(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu_1)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$$\n\nThe likelihood ratio becomes:\n$$\\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(t^{\\ast} - \\mu_1)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(t^{\\ast} - \\mu_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{FP}}(1-p)}{C_{\\mathrm{FN}}p}$$\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(t^{\\ast} - \\mu_1)^2}{2\\sigma^2} + \\frac{(t^{\\ast} - \\mu_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{FP}}(1-p)}{C_{\\mathrm{FN}}p}$$\n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\frac{(t^{\\ast} - \\mu_1)^2}{2\\sigma^2} + \\frac{(t^{\\ast} - \\mu_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{FP}}(1-p)}{C_{\\mathrm{FN}}p}\\right)$$\n\nMultiply by $2\\sigma^2$ and expand the squared terms:\n$$-( (t^{\\ast})^2 - 2t^{\\ast}\\mu_1 + \\mu_1^2 ) + ( (t^{\\ast})^2 - 2t^{\\ast}\\mu_0 + \\mu_0^2 ) = 2\\sigma^2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{FP}}(1-p)}{C_{\\mathrm{FN}}p}\\right)$$\n$$-(t^{\\ast})^2 + 2t^{\\ast}\\mu_1 - \\mu_1^2 + (t^{\\ast})^2 - 2t^{\\ast}\\mu_0 + \\mu_0^2 = 2\\sigma^2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{FP}}(1-p)}{C_{\\mathrm{FN}}p}\\right)$$\n\nThe $(t^{\\ast})^2$ terms cancel.

The objective is to find the minimum of a variable ($D$) subject to a set of inequalities. As will be shown, these constraints define a non-empty, closed interval for the dose, so a unique minimum exists.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical and pharmacological language. All parameters are given as objective numerical values.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum dose, $D_{\\min}$, that satisfies two pharmacodynamic constraints simultaneously. The dose $D$ is related to the steady-state plasma concentration $c$ by the pharmacokinetic equation:\n$$c(D) = \\frac{F D}{V_{d}}$$\nSince $F$ and $V_d$ are positive constants, the concentration $c$ is a monotonically increasing function of the dose $D$. We can first determine the range of concentrations $c$ that satisfy the therapeutic window constraints and then convert the minimum required concentration to the minimum dose.\n\nThe two constraints for the therapeutic window are:\n$1.$ $e(c) \\geq \\theta$ (beneficial effect)\n$2.$ $s(c) \\leq \\phi$ (adverse effect)\n\nLet's analyze each constraint separately to find the permissible range for the concentration $c$.\n\n**Constraint 1: Minimum Required Cytokine Suppression**\nThe beneficial effect must be at or above a target level $\\theta$:\n$$e(c) = E_{\\max,\\mathrm{cyt}} \\cdot \\frac{c}{K_{c} + c} \\geq \\theta$$\nSince $c \\ge 0$, we can manipulate the inequality.\n$$E_{\\max,\\mathrm{cyt}} \\cdot c \\geq \\theta (K_{c} + c)$$\n$$E_{\\max,\\mathrm{cyt}} \\cdot c \\geq \\theta K_{c} + \\theta c$$\n$$(E_{\\max,\\mathrm{cyt}} - \\theta) c \\geq \\theta K_{c}$$\nWe are given $E_{\\max,\\mathrm{cyt}} = 0.90$ and $\\theta = 0.60$, so $(E_{\\max,\\mathrm{cyt}} - \\theta) = 0.30 > 0$. We can divide by this term without changing the inequality direction.\n$$c \\geq \\frac{\\theta K_{c}}{E_{\\max,\\mathrm{cyt}} - \\theta}$$\nThis inequality defines a minimum required concentration, which we denote $c_{\\min}$:\n$$c_{\\min} = \\frac{\\theta K_{c}}{E_{\\max,\\mathrm{cyt}} - \\theta}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$c_{\\min} = \\frac{0.60 \\times 30\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}}{0.90 - 0.60} = \\frac{18}{0.30}\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} = 60\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\nThus, to achieve the desired therapeutic effect, the concentration must be at least $60\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n\n**Constraint 2: Maximum Tolerable Immune Suppression**\nThe adverse effect must be at or below a tolerable level $\\phi$:\n$$s(c) = E_{\\max,\\mathrm{imm}} \\cdot \\frac{c}{K_{s} + c} \\leq \\phi$$\nAgain, since $c \\ge 0$:\n$$E_{\\max,\\mathrm{imm}} \\cdot c \\leq \\phi (K_{s} + c)$$\n$$E_{\\max,\\mathrm{imm}} \\cdot c \\leq \\phi K_{s} + \\phi c$$\n$$(E_{\\max,\\mathrm{imm}} - \\phi) c \\leq \\phi K_{s}$$\nWe are given $E_{\\max,\\mathrm{imm}} = 0.70$ and $\\phi = 0.25$, so $(E_{\\max,\\mathrm{imm}} - \\phi) = 0.45 > 0$. We can divide by this term without changing the inequality direction.\n$$c \\leq \\frac{\\phi K_{s}}{E_{\\max,\\mathrm{imm}} - \\phi}$$\nThis inequality defines a maximum allowable concentration, which we denote $c_{\\max}$:\n$$c_{\\max} = \\frac{\\phi K_{s}}{E_{\\max,\\mathrm{imm}} - \\phi}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$c_{\\max} = \\frac{0.25 \\times 200\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}}{0.70 - 0.25} = \\frac{50}{0.45}\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} = \\frac{50}{9/20}\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} = \\frac{1000}{9}\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\nNumerically, $c_{\\max} \\approx 111.11\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. Thus, to avoid unacceptable toxicity, the concentration must not exceed approximately $111.11\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n\n**Determining the Minimum Dose**\nThe therapeutic window for the concentration $c$ requires satisfying both constraints, so $c$ must be in the interval $[c_{\\min}, c_{\\max}]$. A valid therapeutic window exists since $c_{\\min} = 60\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ is less than $c_{\\max} = \\frac{1000}{9}\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\nThe allowed concentration range is $c \\in [60, \\frac{1000}{9}]\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n\nWe need to find the minimum dose $D_{\\min}$ that satisfies these constraints. Since $c(D)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $D$, the minimum dose corresponds to the minimum effective concentration required. The minimum concentration that satisfies both conditions is the lower bound of the therapeutic interval, which is $c_{\\min}$.\nLet's call the minimum concentration required to satisfy all constraints $c_{\\text{req}}$.\n$$c_{\\text{req}} = c_{\\min} = 60\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\n\nNow, we convert this minimum required concentration back into a dose using the rearranged PK equation:\n$$D = \\frac{c V_{d}}{F}$$\nThe minimum dose $D_{\\min}$ is therefore:\n$$D_{\\min} = \\frac{c_{\\text{req}} V_{d}}{F}$$\nSubstituting the values for $c_{\\text{req}}$, $V_{d}$, and $F$:\n$$D_{\\min} = \\frac{(60\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1})(3\\,\\mathrm{L})}{1} = 180\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final result to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact result is $180\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. To express this with four significant figures of precision, we write it as $180.0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{180.0}$$", "id": "4653324"}]}
