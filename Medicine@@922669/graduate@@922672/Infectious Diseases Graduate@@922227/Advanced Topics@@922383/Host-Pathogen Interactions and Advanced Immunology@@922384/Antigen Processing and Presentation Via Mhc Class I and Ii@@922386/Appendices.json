The Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) is an ABC transporter composed of TAP1 and TAP2 that ferries cytosolic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, where Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules assemble with peptide and $\\beta_2$-microglobulin ($\\beta_2$m) before egress to the plasma membrane. The Walker A motif within an NBD coordinates ATP and is essential for the ATPase cycle that powers substrate movement.\n\nYou engineer a human cell line lacking endogenous TAP1 and complement it with either wild-type TAP1 or a TAP1 allele bearing a Walker A motif mutation that abrogates ATP hydrolysis while preserving TAP complex assembly with TAP2. From first principles about ABC transporter mechanics and MHC class I biogenesis, predict the effect of the TAP1 Walker A mutation on peptide translocation into the ER and on steady-state surface MHC class I abundance, and propose a specific experimental assay that can directly measure the predicted transport defect and the change in surface MHC class I.\n\nWhich single option best fits these constraints?\n\nA. ATP hydrolysis at the TAP1 NBD is required for the conformational cycling that drives peptide movement; thus, the Walker A mutation will reduce ER peptide translocation to near background and markedly lower surface MHC class I.

The validity of the problem must first be established.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters use cyclical ATP binding and hydrolysis at two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) to drive substrate translocation.\n- The Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP) is an ABC transporter composed of TAP$1$ and TAP$2$.\n- TAP ferries cytosolic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen.\n- In the ER, Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I molecules assemble with peptide and $\\beta_2$-microglobulin ($\\beta_2$m).\n- Assembled MHC class I complexes egress to the plasma membrane.\n- The Walker A motif within an NBD coordinates ATP and is essential for the ATPase cycle.\n- An engineered human cell line lacks endogenous TAP$1$.\n- This cell line is complemented with either wild-type TAP$1$ or a TAP$1$ allele with a Walker A motif mutation.\n- The mutation abrogates ATP hydrolysis but preserves TAP complex assembly with TAP$2$.\n- The task is to predict the effect of this mutation on peptide translocation into the ER and on steady-state surface MHC class I abundance, and to propose experimental assays to measure these effects.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The description of ABC transporters, the TAP-MHC class I pathway, and the function of the Walker A motif (a P-loop, GXXXXGKT/S) are all fundamental and well-established principles in biochemistry, cell biology, and immunology. The use of a dominant-negative mutation in a Walker A motif to \"trap\" an ABC transporter in an ATP-bound state is a standard and valid experimental approach.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear initial condition (a specific mutation in TAP$1$) and asks for specific, predictable outcomes (peptide transport, surface MHC I) and the methods to measure them. The system is well-defined, allowing for a unique solution based on first principles.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjectivity.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. The premises are factually correct, the question is formalizable and relevant to the fields of infectious diseases and immunology, the setup is complete and consistent, and the scenario is experimentally feasible. It requires a substantive understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nFrom first principles, the function of the TAP transporter and the biogenesis of MHC class I molecules can be analyzed.\n\n$1$. **ABC Transporter Mechanism and the Effect of the Mutation:** ABC transporters like TAP function through a series of conformational changes driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis at their two NBDs. The generally accepted model is as follows:\n    a. In the resting state, the transporter presents a substrate-binding site to the cytosol (inward-open conformation).\n    b. Substrate (peptide) and ATP binding induces a major conformational change, leading to the dimerization of the two NBDs.\n    c. NBD dimerization reorients the transmembrane domains (TMDs), occluding the cytosolic access and exposing the substrate-binding site to the ER lumen (outward-open conformation), releasing the peptide.\n    d. ATP hydrolysis at the NBDs, followed by release of ADP and inorganic phosphate ($P_i$), causes the NBDs to dissociate, resetting the transporter to its initial inward-open conformation. This reset is essential for a new cycle of transport.\n\nThe problem states that the Walker A mutation in TAP$1$ abrogates ATP hydrolysis. The Walker A motif is critical for binding and positioning the triphosphate group of ATP for nucleophilic attack. A non-functional Walker A motif typically allows ATP binding but prevents hydrolysis. Therefore, the TAP$1$/TAP$2$ heterodimer can bind ATP and likely undergo the initial conformational change to translocate a peptide. However, because the TAP$1$ NBD cannot hydrolyze its bound ATP, the NBD cannot dissociate from the TAP$2$ NBD. The transporter becomes trapped in a rigid, post-translocation (or ATP-bound occluded) state. It cannot reset to begin a new transport cycle. This effectively blocks continuous, efficient peptide transport. Thus, peptide translocation into the ER will be severely inhibited, reduced to near-background levels corresponding to at most a single stoichiometric turnover event per transporter molecule.\n\n$2$. **Consequences for MHC Class I Surface Expression:** The MHC class I antigen presentation pathway is critically dependent on a steady supply of peptides into the ER. In the ER, nascent MHC class I heavy chains associate with $\\beta_2$m and await peptide binding while part of the peptide-loading complex (PLC), which includes TAP. The binding of a high-affinity peptide is required to stabilize the tertiary structure of the MHC class I molecule. Only stable, peptide-loaded MHC class I complexes are released from the PLC and are competent for transport through the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface. In the absence of a sufficient peptide supply due to the non-functional TAP transporter, MHC class I molecules will fail to fold and stabilize correctly. They will be retained in the ER and ultimately be targeted for degradation via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Consequently, the flux of MHC class I complexes to the plasma membrane will be drastically reduced, leading to a markedly lower steady-state abundance of surface MHC class I molecules.\n\n$3$. **Proposed Experimental Assays:**\n    a. **To Measure Peptide Translocation:** A direct in vitro transport assay is required. A common method involves using semi-permeabilized cells (e.g., using streptolysin O or digitonin to permeabilize the plasma membrane but leave the ER membrane intact). A synthetic peptide substrate, specifically designed for detection, is added to the reaction along with ATP. Two detection strategies are standard:\n        i. Using a radiolabeled peptide (e.g., with $^{125}$I). After incubation, extracellular (untransported) components are digested with a protease. The protease cannot cross the ER membrane, so any transported peptide is protected. The amount of protected, radioactive peptide is quantified.\n        ii. Using a peptide that contains a consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation (Asn-X-Ser/Thr). If the peptide enters the ER lumen, the resident enzyme oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) will attach a glycan. This increases the peptide's molecular weight, which can be detected by a size shift on an SDS-PAGE gel and subsequent Western blotting.\n        A functional TAP will show robust, ATP-dependent accumulation of protected or glycosylated peptide. The mutant TAP will show near-background levels.\n    b. **To Measure Surface MHC Class I:** The most direct and quantitative method is flow cytometry. Intact, live cells are stained with a fluorescently-labeled antibody that recognizes surface MHC class I molecules. To specifically assess the abundance of *functional* complexes, it is crucial to use a conformation-dependent monoclonal antibody (e.g., W6/32 for pan-human HLA-A, -B, -C), which binds only to the correctly folded heterodimer of heavy chain, $\\beta_2$m, and peptide. Cells expressing the mutant TAP$1$ will show a significant decrease in fluorescence intensity compared to cells expressing wild-type TAP$1$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. ATP hydrolysis at the TAP1 NBD is required for the conformational cycling that drives peptide movement; thus, the Walker A mutation will reduce ER peptide translocation to near background and markedly lower surface MHC class I. Measure transport in semi-permeabilized cells by providing a radiolabeled or glycosylatable peptide and ATP, scoring luminal protease protection or acquisition of an N-linked glycan as the readout; quantify surface MHC class I by flow cytometry using a conformation-dependent antibody that selectively recognizes peptide-loaded complexes.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with the derivation from first principles. The predicted effects on peptide translocation (severely reduced) and surface MHC class I (markedly lower) are correct. The proposed experimental assays are the gold-standard, direct, and most appropriate methods to measure these specific effects.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. ATP is required for initial peptide binding but not for translocation; therefore, the Walker A mutation will not impair peptide translocation and surface MHC class I will remain unchanged. Assess the outcome by western blotting for TAP1 protein abundance alone.**\nThis option is fundamentally incorrect. The premise that ATP hydrolysis is not required for translocation is false; it is required for resetting the transporter to allow for catalytic cycling. The predictions that translocation and surface MHC I are unchanged are therefore incorrect. The proposed experiment, western blotting for TAP$1$ abundance, is irrelevant as it measures protein level, not function, and the problem states the mutant assembles normally.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Hydrolysis by TAP2 alone is sufficient for translocation; peptide import and surface MHC class I will be near normal. Evaluate the pathway by measuring cytosolic proteasome activity as a surrogate for peptide supply.**\nThis option is incorrect. While the two NBDs can have asymmetric roles, the efficient transport cycle of ABC transporters requires the coordinated action of both NBDs. Complete abrogation of hydrolysis at one site is known to be severely debilitating for transport, not resulting in \"near normal\" function. Furthermore, measuring proteasome activity is an inappropriate assay; it measures the production of peptides in the cytosol, not their transport into the ER, which is the process being investigated.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The mutation will decrease ER peptide translocation, but bulk surface MHC class I will be unchanged due to compensatory cross-presentation from endosomes. Monitor the compensation by assaying autophagy markers such as LC3 lipidation rather than direct peptide transport or MHC class I surface levels.**\nThis option is flawed. While it correctly states that peptide translocation will decrease, it incorrectly predicts that surface MHC class I will be unchanged. Compensatory pathways like cross-presentation or autophagy-mediated presentation are not generally efficient enough in most cell types to fully restore surface levels in the face of a complete TAP blockade. The claim \"unchanged\" is a significant overstatement. Moreover, the experimental proposal is poor; it suggests measuring an indirect, alternative pathway (autophagy) instead of directly measuring the primary predicted effects on transport and surface MHC I, which the question explicitly asks about.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4622252"}, {"introduction": "We now shift our focus from the cytosolic route to the endocytic environment of the MHC class II pathway, a complex factory for processing extracellular antigens.

It defines a simplified kinetic model ($X_{0} \\to X_{1} \\to X_{2}$), specifies a perturbation (inhibition of the $X_{0} \\to X_{1}$ step via reduction of $k_{s}$), and asks for the predictable consequences on the system's steady state. This structure allows for a unique, qualitative solution based on principles of chemical kinetics and cell biology.\n*   **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and devoid of subjectivity.

It is not scientifically unsound, is formalizable, is self-contained, depicts a realistic biological experiment, is well-posed, and requires substantive reasoning.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. Proceeding to the solution.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem describes the MHC class II antigen presentation pathway, which can be represented by the simplified sequential reaction scheme:\n$$ X_{0} \\xrightarrow{k_s} X_{1} \\xrightarrow{k_{dm}} X_{2} $$\nHere, $X_{0}$ represents the MHC II-$\\alpha\\beta$ complex bound to the full-length or partially processed invariant chain (Ii). $X_{1}$ represents the complex where Ii has been fully degraded to the CLIP peptide, which occupies the peptide-binding groove. $X_{2}$ represents the final, functional complex where CLIP has been exchanged for an antigenic peptide.\n\nThe experiment introduces an inhibitor that selectively and substantially reduces the rate constant $k_{s}$. This rate constant governs the conversion of $X_{0}$ to $X_{1}$, which is biologically accomplished by proteases, with Cathepsin S being dominant in the specified cells. According to the principles of chemical kinetics, inhibiting a step in a sequential pathway has two primary consequences:\n1.  **Accumulation of the substrate**: The concentration of the species immediately preceding the inhibited step will increase, as its consumption is blocked while its production continues. In this case, the concentration of $X_{0}$ will increase. Biologically, this corresponds to an accumulation of MHC II complexes bound to full-length Ii and its larger proteolytic fragments (e.g., Ii-p22, Ii-p10) within the MIIC, the cellular compartment where this processing occurs.\n2.  **Depletion of the products**: The rate of formation of all downstream species will decrease due to a lack of precursor supply. The rate of formation of $X_{1}$ is $v_{1} = k_{s} [X_0]$. Since $k_{s}$ is substantially reduced, $v_1$ will decrease dramatically, leading to a lower steady-state concentration of $X_{1}$ (MHC II-CLIP). Consequently, the rate of formation of $X_{2}$, $v_{2} = k_{dm} [X_1]$, will also decrease because its substrate, $X_{1}$, is depleted. This results in a decreased steady-state concentration of $X_{2}$ (peptide-MHC II).\n\nThe question asks for the effect on the surface population of these complexes. Since the final functional product, $X_{2}$, is produced in much smaller quantities, the pool of surface peptide-MHC II complexes available for recognition by CD$4^{+}$ T cells will be significantly reduced.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Accumulation of MHC II bound to Invariant chain fragments (e.g., Ii-p22/Ii-p10) within MIIC, increased proportion of surface MHC II carrying CLIP due to stalled editing, and a reduced pool of surface peptide–MHC II ($X_{2}$) complexes available for CD$4^{+}$ T cell recognition.**\n*   `Accumulation of MHC II bound to Invariant chain fragments ... within MIIC`: This is correct. Inhibiting Cathepsin S blocks the conversion of Ii-MHC II intermediates to CLIP-MHC II ($X_1$), causing the intermediates (part of the $X_0}$ pool) to accumulate in the MIIC.\n*   `reduced pool of surface peptide–MHC II (X2) complexes`: This is correct. The production of the final product $X_{2}$ is severely curtailed due to the upstream block, leading to its reduced expression on the cell surface.\n*   `increased proportion of surface MHC II carrying CLIP due to stalled editing`: This describes the state of the pathway. \"Editing\" refers to the HLA-DM-catalyzed exchange of CLIP for peptide ($X_1 \\to X_2$). This process is \"stalled\" due to the severely diminished supply of its substrate, $X_1$. While the *absolute number* of surface MHC II-CLIP complexes will likely decrease, their proportion relative to the final peptide-loaded complexes ($[X_1]_{surf} / [X_2]_{surf}$) will increase. The overall result is a failure to produce the properly edited $X_2$ complexes, meaning the processed complexes that do manage to escape to the surface are more likely to be in an unedited or incompletely processed state. This statement accurately captures the qualitative shift in the composition of processed MHC II.\nAll three parts of this option are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**B. Accelerated removal of CLIP because HLA-DM activity is increased by Cathepsin S inhibition, yielding an increased pool of surface peptide–MHC II and a decrease in CLIP–MHC II.**\n*   `HLA-DM activity is increased`: Incorrect. The problem explicitly states that $k_{dm}$ is unchanged. There is no known biological mechanism for Cathepsin S inhibition to activate HLA-DM.\n*   `increased pool of surface peptide–MHC II`: Incorrect. As derived above, the pool of the final product $X_{2}$ must decrease, not increase.\n\n**C. Formation of empty MHC II at the plasma membrane because Ii proteolysis is blocked, allowing extracellular peptides to bind directly at the cell surface and thereby increasing surface peptide–MHC II.**\n*   `Formation of empty MHC II at the plasma membrane`: Incorrect. The invariant chain (Ii) is essential for the proper folding and trafficking of MHC class II molecules. Without Ii or a peptide in the binding groove, MHC II molecules are unstable and are typically retained and degraded in the ER. They do not reach the plasma membrane as \"empty\" molecules. Blocking Ii *proteolysis* means MHC II remains bound to Ii fragments, not that it becomes empty.\n*   `allowing extracellular peptides to bind directly`: Incorrect. Peptide binding to MHC II is inefficient at the neutral pH of the cell surface and is optimally catalyzed by HLA-DM in the acidic environment of the MIIC.\n\n**D. Negligible changes in the MHC class II pathway, but a pronounced reduction in Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC I) peptide loading due to shared dependence on Cathepsin S in the cytosol.**\n*   `Negligible changes in the MHC class II pathway`: Incorrect. Cathepsin S is stated to be a *dominant* Ii-processing protease in these cells, so its inhibition will cause major changes.\n*   `pronounced reduction in Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC I) peptide loading`: Incorrect. The MHC class I pathway processes endogenous antigens from the cytosol. Peptides are generated by the proteasome and loaded in the ER. Cathepsin S is a lysosomal protease active in the endocytic pathway (MHC class II pathway) and has no established role in the cytosolic MHC class I pathway.\n\n**E. Decreased generation of CLIP such that CLIP–MHC II declines at the cell surface, coupled to a compensatory rise in empty MHC II and peptide–MHC II owing to prolonged residence time in MIIC.**\n*   `Decreased generation of CLIP such that CLIP–MHC II declines at the cell surface`: This part is correct in terms of absolute number.\n*   `compensatory rise in empty MHC II`: Incorrect. As explained for option C, empty MHC II molecules are not formed and trafficked to the surface under these conditions.\n*   `compensatory rise in ... peptide–MHC II`: Incorrect. No amount of \"prolonged residence time\" can compensate for the lack of substrate ($X_{1}$) for the formation of $X_{2}$. The overall flux is reduced, so a compensatory rise in the final product is impossible.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption A provides the most accurate and comprehensive prediction of the consequences of Cathepsin S inhibition.

Substituting this into the balance equation gives:\n$$\n0 = J - k_{\\text{off}}N_{\\text{ss}}\n$$\nwhere $N_{\\text{ss}}$ is the number of complexes at steady state. Solving for $N_{\\text{ss}}$, we find its functional dependence on the flux $J$ and the off-rate $k_{\\text{off}}$:\n$$\nN_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{J}{k_{\\text{off}}}\n$$\nThis expression indicates that the steady-state number of complexes is directly proportional to the rate of supply to the surface and inversely proportional to the dissociation rate constant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.925}$$", "id": "4622248"}]}
