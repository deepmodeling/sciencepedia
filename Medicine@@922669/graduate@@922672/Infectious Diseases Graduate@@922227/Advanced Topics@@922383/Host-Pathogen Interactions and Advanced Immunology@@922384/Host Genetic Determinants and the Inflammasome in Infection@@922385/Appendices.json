Bone marrow–derived macrophages are primed with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist lipopolysaccharide to induce pro–interleukin-1 beta (pro–IL-1β) transcription and translation. After priming, cells are transfected with synthetic dsDNA poly(dA:dT) to selectively engage Absent In Melanoma 2 (AIM2). Supernatants and cell lysates are collected and assayed for caspase-1 (CASP1) p20 by immunoblot, mature IL-1β by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage by immunoblot, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release as a measure of lytic cell death.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions that AIM2 is a cytosolic dsDNA sensor with a pyrin domain (PYD) but no caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), that PYCARD nucleates inflammasome assembly by PYD–PYD and CARD–CARD interactions to bridge sensors to procaspase-1, and that activated caspase-1 processes pro–IL-1β into mature IL-1β and cleaves GSDMD to drive pyroptosis, which of the following patterns best predicts the functional consequence of a loss-of-function mutation in PYCARD on AIM2-driven CASP1 activation and IL-1β release in these macrophages?\n\nA.

The bridging mechanism involves `PYD–PYD` and `CARD–CARD` interactions.\n    7.  Activated `caspase-1` processes `pro–IL-1β` into mature `IL-1β`.\n    8.  Activated `caspase-1` cleaves `GSDMD` to drive pyroptosis.\n- **Question:** Predict the functional consequence of a loss-of-function `PYCARD` mutation on `AIM2`-driven responses.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the required criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of innate immunology. The described experiment is a canonical method for studying the `AIM2` inflammasome. The roles of `LPS` as a priming signal via `TLR4`, `poly(dA:dT)` as an `AIM2` agonist, and the functions of `AIM2`, `PYCARD` (`ASC`), `caspase-1`, `IL-1β`, and `GSDMD` are all accurately represented according to current scientific consensus.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear set of initial conditions, a single well-defined perturbation (loss of `PYCARD` function), and asks for a predictable outcome based on a set of explicitly stated molecular rules. A unique, logical solution can be derived.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the invalidating flaws:\n1.  **Scientific/Factual Unsoundness:** None. The premises are factually correct.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant:** Not applicable.\n3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The setup is complete and internally consistent.\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The described experiment is standard and feasible.\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured:** The structure is logical and leads to a unique conclusion.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological:** The problem requires specific knowledge of inflammasome architecture and is not trivial.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability:** The predictions are experimentally verifiable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is derived by applying the provided fundamental definitions to the experimental setup.\n\n**1. Baseline Pathway (Wild-Type Macrophages):**\n- **Priming (Signal 1):** `LPS` engages `TLR4`, activating intracellular signaling pathways (e.g., `NF-κB`) that result in the transcription and translation of `pro–IL-1β`. At this stage, the inactive precursor `pro–IL-1β` accumulates in the cytosol.\n- **Activation (Signal 2):** Transfected `poly(dA:dT)` mimics `dsDNA` in the cytosol. According to the premises, `AIM2`, the cytosolic `dsDNA` sensor, binds to `poly(dA:dT)`.\n- **Inflammasome Assembly:** Upon binding `dsDNA`, `AIM2` molecules oligomerize. The exposed `PYD` domains on the `AIM2` oligomer serve as a scaffold. The adaptor protein `PYCARD` (`ASC`) is recruited via a homotypic `PYD-PYD` interaction between `AIM2` and `PYCARD`. This recruitment causes `PYCARD` to polymerize into a large helical filament, often visible as a \"speck\". `PYCARD` also has a `CARD` domain. This `CARD` domain recruits `procaspase-1` (which also contains a `CARD`) via a homotypic `CARD-CARD` interaction.\n- **Caspase-1 Activation:** The recruitment of multiple `procaspase-1` molecules into close proximity on the `PYCARD` filament facilitates their auto-proteolytic cleavage and activation. This generates the active `caspase-1` enzyme, which is a heterotetramer containing `p20` and `p10` subunits. The `p20` subunit is a common marker for `caspase-1` activation.\n- **Effector Functions:**\n    - Active `caspase-1` cleaves `pro–IL-1β` into its mature, biologically active `17` kDa form (`IL-1β`).\n    - Active `caspase-1` cleaves `GSDMD`. The resulting N-terminal fragment of `GSDMD` forms pores in the plasma membrane.\n    - These `GSDMD` pores mediate the lytic cell death known as pyroptosis, leading to the release of cellular contents, including mature `IL-1β` and cytosolic enzymes like `LDH`.\n\n**2. Effect of `PYCARD` Loss-of-Function:**\nThe problem asks for the outcome in macrophages with a loss-of-function mutation in `PYCARD`.\n- **Priming and Activation:** The priming step (`LPS` leading to `pro–IL-1β` production) and the initial activation step (`AIM2` binding to `poly(dA:dT)`) are upstream of `PYCARD` and will proceed normally. `Pro–IL-1β` will be present in the cell lysate.\n- **Inflammasome Assembly Failure:** The central premise is that `PYCARD` \"bridges sensors to `procaspase-1`\" via `PYD–PYD` and `CARD–CARD` interactions. It is stated that `AIM2` has a `PYD` but no `CARD`, and `procaspase-1` has a `CARD`. Without a functional `PYCARD` protein, there is no molecule to link the `AIM2-PYD` domain to the `procaspase-1-CARD` domain. The assembly of the inflammasome is therefore abrogated at this critical step. `Procaspase-1` will not be recruited and activated.\n- **Consequences of Assembly Failure:**\n    - **`CASP1` p20:** Since `procaspase-1` is not activated, no active `caspase-1` is generated. Therefore, the `CASP1` `p20` subunit will be absent.\n    - **Mature `IL-1β`:** Without active `caspase-1`, the accumulated `pro–IL-1β` cannot be cleaved. Mature `IL-1β` will not be produced and, consequently, will not be released or detected by `ELISA` in the supernatant. `Pro–IL-1β` will remain in the cell lysates.\n    - **`GSDMD` Cleavage and `LDH` Release:** Without active `caspase-1`, `GSDMD` will not be cleaved. No membrane pores will form, and pyroptosis will not occur. This results in a marked reduction or complete absence of `LDH` release into the supernatant.\n\nThis logical chain of events directly leads to the predictions outlined in one of the options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. CASP1 p20 and mature IL-1β in the supernatant are comparable to wild type because AIM2 directly recruits procaspase-1 via its own caspase activation and recruitment domain; LDH release and GSDMD cleavage are unchanged.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement is fundamentally incorrect. It contradicts a core premise of the problem, which explicitly states that `AIM2` has a `PYD` but **no** `CARD`. Direct recruitment of `procaspase-1` by `AIM2` is therefore impossible.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. CASP1 p20 is absent from the supernatant and mature IL-1β is not released; pro–IL-1β accumulates in lysates; GSDMD cleavage and LDH release are markedly reduced due to failure of inflammasome assembly.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement perfectly matches the deductions from our step-by-step analysis. The loss of the `PYCARD` adaptor protein prevents inflammasome assembly, which blocks `caspase-1` activation and all its downstream consequences: `IL-1β` maturation and release, `GSDMD` cleavage, and pyroptotic `LDH` release.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**C. Mature IL-1β release is moderately reduced, but CASP1 p20 and LDH release remain robust because cytosolic dsDNA activates the noncanonical caspase-11 pathway to compensate for loss of PYCARD.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement is incorrect for two primary reasons. First, the noncanonical inflammasome pathway is activated by cytosolic `LPS`, not cytosolic `dsDNA`. The agonist in this experiment is `poly(dA:dT)`. Second, `caspase-11` (murine) does not directly process `pro–IL-1β`. It primarily cleaves `GSDMD`, and the subsequent pyroptosis can lead to secondary activation of the `NLRP3` inflammasome, which itself would still require `PYCARD`. Therefore, this proposed compensatory mechanism is not relevant to the `AIM2` pathway and does not bypass the requirement for `PYCARD` for `IL-1β` processing.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Mature IL-1β release is increased and occurs earlier because PYCARD is a negative regulator of AIM2; CASP1 p20 and LDH release are enhanced relative to wild type.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement posits that `PYCARD` is a negative regulator. This is a direct contradiction of its established role and the premise provided in the problem: \"`PYCARD` nucleates inflammasome assembly ... to bridge sensors to `procaspase-1`.\" As an essential positive component (an adaptor), its loss-of-function cannot result in an enhanced response.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4650354"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying the components, a quantitative understanding of inflammasome signaling is crucial for predicting cellular behavior.

The rate of change of $P(t)$ is the sum of its production rate minus its degradation rate.\nThe production rate is given as a constant, $k_t$.\nThe degradation is a first-order process, meaning its rate is proportional to the current abundance, given by $k_d P(t)$.\nThus, the mass balance equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = k_t - k_d P(t)\n$$\nSteady state is defined as the condition where the abundance no longer changes with time. Mathematically, this corresponds to the time derivative being zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = 0\n$$\nLet $P^{\\ast}$ denote the steady-state abundance of pro-IL-1β.

However, we can estimate the probabilities of exposure conditional on disease status, such as $P(E|D)$. This allows us to calculate the exposure odds ratio ($\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{exposure}}$), which is the ratio of the odds of exposure among cases to the odds of exposure among controls.\n\nThe odds of exposure among cases is estimated by the ratio of exposed cases to unexposed cases:\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{Odds}}(E|D) = \\frac{a}{b} $$\nThe odds of exposure among controls is estimated by the ratio of exposed controls to unexposed controls:\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{Odds}}(E|\\neg D) = \\frac{c}{d} $$\nThe exposure odds ratio is the ratio of these two odds:\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}_{\\text{exposure}} = \\frac{\\widehat{\\mathrm{Odds}}(E|D)}{\\widehat{\\mathrm{Odds}}(E|\\neg D)} = \\frac{a/b}{c/d} = \\frac{ad}{bc} $$\nA fundamental property of the odds ratio is that the disease odds ratio is mathematically equivalent to the exposure odds ratio ($\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{disease}} = \\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{exposure}}$).

The variance of the logit-transformed proportion, $\\ln(\\hat{p}_1/(1-\\hat{p}_1)) = \\ln(a/b)$, is approximated by:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\ln(a/b)) \\approx \\frac{1}{n_1 p_1 (1-p_1)} \\approx \\frac{1}{(a+b) \\frac{a}{a+b} \\frac{b}{a+b}} = \\frac{a+b}{ab} = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} $$\nSimilarly, for the controls:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\ln(c/d)) \\approx \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d} $$\nSince the cases and controls are independent samples, the variance of the difference of the log-odds, which is $\\ln(\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}) = \\ln(a/b) - \\ln(c/d)$, is the sum of their individual variances:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\ln(\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}})) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d}\\right) = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d} $$\nThe standard error (SE) is the square root of the variance.\n$$ \\mathrm{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d}} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ \\mathrm{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{38} + \\frac{1}{90} + \\frac{1}{40} + \\frac{1}{216}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.026316 + 0.011111 + 0.025 + 0.004630} \\approx \\sqrt{0.067057} \\approx 0.25895 $$\nThe point estimate for the log-odds ratio is $\\ln(\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}) = \\ln(2.28) \\approx 0.82418$.\n\nAn approximate $0.95$ confidence interval for $\\ln(\\mathrm{OR})$ is given by $\\ln(\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}) \\pm Z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\mathrm{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{\\mathrm{OR}}))$. For a $0.95$ confidence level, $\\alpha=0.05$, and the critical value from the standard normal distribution is $Z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$.\n\nLower bound for $\\ln(\\mathrm{OR})$: $0.82418 - 1.96 \\times 0.25895 \\approx 0.82418 - 0.50754 = 0.31664$\nUpper bound for $\\ln(\\mathrm{OR})$: $0.82418 + 1.96 \\times 0.25895 \\approx 0.82418 + 0.50754 = 1.33172$\n\nTo obtain the confidence interval for the $\\mathrm{OR}$, we exponentiate the bounds of the interval for $\\ln(\\mathrm{OR})$:\nLower bound for $\\mathrm{OR}$: $\\exp(0.31664) \\approx 1.3725$\nUpper bound for $\\mathrm{OR}$: $\\exp(1.33172) \\approx 3.7874$\n\nRounding the bounds to three significant figures, the $0.95$ confidence interval for the odds ratio is $(1.37, 3.79)$.\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation of the Confidence Interval**\n\nThe $0.95$ confidence interval for the odds ratio is $(1.37, 3.79)$. This interval does not include the null value of $1$. An odds ratio of $1$ signifies no association between the exposure and the outcome. Since the entire interval lies above $1$, the observed association is statistically significant at the $\\alpha=0.05$ level.\n\nThe direction of the association is positive. The point estimate of the $\\mathrm{OR}$ is $2.28$, and the confidence interval ranges from $1.37$ to $3.79$. This indicates that carriers of the NLRP3 variant have significantly increased odds of developing severe pneumonia compared to noncarriers, within the context of influenza coinfection. Specifically, the odds of severe pneumonia are estimated to be $2.28$ times higher among carriers of the NLRP3 variant than among noncarriers.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2.28} $$", "id": "4650289"}]}
