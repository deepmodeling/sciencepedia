The processes (mass-action kinetics, first-order decay, constant source) are well-established for modeling such systems. The problem is well-posed; it asks for a specific quantity, $\\epsilon_c$, derived from a stability analysis of a well-defined system of ODEs. The language is objective and precise. The provided information is self-contained and sufficient to construct the model and perform the required analysis. The constraint $a + d_L > \\rho$ is crucial for ensuring the latent cell population does not grow exponentially on its own, which is a biologically reasonable assumption for a stable latent reservoir that requires replenishment from active infection. All parameters are stated to be nonnegative, which is physically consistent. The problem is neither trivial nor tautological and requires a standard but non-obvious application of stability theory for dynamical systems.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nBased on the processes described, we construct the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the populations $T(t)$, $I(t)$, and $L(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = s - d_T T - (1-\\epsilon)\\beta T I\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = (1-f)(1-\\epsilon)\\beta T I + aL - \\delta I\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dt} = f(1-\\epsilon)\\beta T I + \\rho L - a L - d_L L = f(1-\\epsilon)\\beta T I - (a+d_L-\\rho)L\n$$\n\nThe disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is the steady state where there is no infection, i.e., $I=0$ and $L=0$. At this equilibrium, the equation for $T$ becomes $\\frac{dT}{dt} = s - d_T T = 0$, which yields the equilibrium target cell count $T_0 = \\frac{s}{d_T}$. Thus, the DFE is $(T_0, I_0, L_0) = (\\frac{s}{d_T}, 0, 0)$.\n\nTo determine the condition under which the infection cannot persist, we analyze the local stability of the DFE. The infection will be cleared if small perturbations in the infected populations, $I$ and $L$, decay over time. This is equivalent to requiring that the basic reproduction number under therapy, $R_{0, \\text{ART}}$, is less than $1$. We use the next-generation matrix method to calculate $R_{0, \\text{ART}}$.\n\nThe infected subsystem is described by the equations for $\\frac{dI}{dt}$ and $\\frac{dL}{dt}$. Let $\\mathcal{F}$ be the vector of rates of new infections and $\\mathcal{V}$ be the vector of rates of transfer between infected compartments.\n$$\n\\mathcal{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} (1-f)(1-\\epsilon)\\beta T I \\\\ f(1-\\epsilon)\\beta T I \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{V} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\delta I - aL \\\\ (a+d_L-\\rho)L \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe linearize these systems by taking the Jacobian matrices with respect to $(I, L)$ and evaluating them at the DFE $(T_0, 0, 0)$.\nLet $F$ and $V$ be the Jacobians of $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{V}$ respectively, evaluated at the DFE:\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{F}}{\\partial(I, L)}\\bigg|_{(\\frac{s}{d_T}, 0, 0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} (1-f)(1-\\epsilon)\\beta \\frac{s}{d_T} & 0 \\\\ f(1-\\epsilon)\\beta \\frac{s}{d_T} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nV = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}}{\\partial(I, L)}\\bigg|_{(\\frac{s}{d_T}, 0, 0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\delta & -a \\\\ 0 & a+d_L-\\rho \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe next-generation matrix is given by $K = F V^{-1}$. First, we compute the inverse of $V$:\n$$\nV^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(V)} \\begin{pmatrix} a+d_L-\\rho & a \\\\ 0 & \\delta \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\delta(a+d_L-\\rho)} \\begin{pmatrix} a+d_L-\\rho & a \\\\ 0 & \\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem statement gives the condition $a+d_L-\\rho > 0$, so $V$ is invertible.\nNow, we compute the next-generation matrix $K$:\n$$\nK = F V^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} (1-f)(1-\\epsilon)\\beta \\frac{s}{d_T} & 0 \\\\ f(1-\\epsilon)\\beta \\frac{s}{d_T} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\delta(a+d_L-\\rho)} \\begin{pmatrix} a+d_L-\\rho & a \\\\ 0 & \\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nK = \\frac{(1-\\epsilon)\\beta s}{d_T \\delta(a+d_L-\\rho)} \\begin{pmatrix} (1-f) & 0 \\\\ f & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a+d_L-\\rho & a \\\\ 0 & \\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nK = \\frac{(1-\\epsilon)\\beta s}{d_T \\delta(a+d_L-\\rho)} \\begin{pmatrix} (1-f)(a+d_L-\\rho) & a(1-f) \\\\ f(a+d_L-\\rho) & af \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_{0, \\text{ART}}$, is the spectral radius (dominant eigenvalue) of $K$. For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ satisfy $\\lambda^2 - \\text{tr}(K)\\lambda + \\det(K) = 0$.\nThe determinant of $K$ is:\n$$\n\\det(K) = \\left(\\frac{(1-\\epsilon)\\beta s}{d_T \\delta(a+d_L-\\rho)}\\right)^2 \\left( (1-f)(a+d_L-\\rho)(af) - a(1-f)f(a+d_L-\\rho) \\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\det(K)=0$, one eigenvalue is $0$. The other eigenvalue is equal to the trace of $K$.\n$$\nR_{0, \\text{ART}} = \\rho(K) = \\text{tr}(K) = \\frac{(1-\\epsilon)\\beta s}{d_T \\delta(a+d_L-\\rho)} \\left( (1-f)(a+d_L-\\rho) + af \\right)\n$$\nWe can simplify the expression in the parenthesis:\n$$\n(1-f)(a+d_L-\\rho) + af = a+d_L-\\rho - fa-fd_L+f\\rho+af = a+(1-f)(d_L-\\rho)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $R_{0, \\text{ART}}$ gives:\n$$\nR_{0, \\text{ART}} = (1-\\epsilon) \\frac{\\beta s}{d_T \\delta} \\frac{a+(1-f)(d_L-\\rho)}{a+d_L-\\rho}\n$$\nThe infection-replenished cycle is not self-sustaining when the DFE is locally stable, which occurs when $R_{0, \\text{ART}} < 1$.

Investigators use two Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based assays on peripheral blood mononuclear cells: quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) for total HIV DNA and the digital droplet Polymerase Chain Reaction Intact Proviral DNA Assay (IPDA). Consider the following mechanistic starting points and definitions.\n\n- By definition, the clinically relevant reservoir is the number of cells harboring genetically intact, replication-competent provirus, denoted by $R^{\\ast}$. The total number of proviruses (intact plus defective) is denoted by $R_{\\text{tot}}$, with defective fraction $f_{d}$ so that $R^{\\ast} = \\left(1 - f_{d}\\right) R_{\\text{tot}}$.\n- For time-to-rebound predictions, assume the following fundamental model: each intact latent cell reactivates independently as a Poisson process with per-cell rate $h$, and virologic rebound occurs at the first reactivation that successfully seeds systemic infection. Under this model, the time to rebound $T$ is the minimum of $R^{\\ast}$ independent exponential waiting times with rate $h$.\n- Let $p_{\\text{tot}}$ and $p_{\\text{int}}$ denote the probability that a proviral template present in the input is detected by the total HIV DNA qPCR and by IPDA, respectively. These probabilities summarize primer–template match, amplicon integrity, and any other per-template detection effects. Let $c$ denote an additive background contamination level that contributes apparent positive copies independent of true input (e.g., low-level carryover).\n- Sampling a finite number of cells induces stochasticity that is well-modeled by Poisson or binomial sampling under limiting-input conditions when detection is perfect. In the absence of detection failure, such sampling is unbiased in expectation but increases variance.\n- Assume that qPCR readouts are susceptible to suboptimal amplification efficiency if uncalibrated, whereas digital droplet Polymerase Chain Reaction (ddPCR) readouts are less sensitive to amplification efficiency but remain sensitive to primer–template mismatches and amplicon dropout.\n\nUsing only the principles above, evaluate the following statements about sources of measurement error when estimating $R^{\\ast}$ with PCR-based assays and how these errors bias inference about cure strategies, including predicted time to rebound and perceived efficacy.

In qPCR, unrecognized PCR inhibition that reduces amplification efficiency below $100\\%$ causes undercounting of templates relative to a properly calibrated standard curve, which biases predicted time to rebound upward and overstates cure effect if not corrected.\n\nChoose all that apply.", "solution": "The problem asks us to evaluate several statements about measurement error in quantifying the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) latent reservoir and the resulting impact on predicting treatment outcomes. The validation of the problem statement finds it to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, based on established principles in virology and molecular diagnostics. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between the size of the intact, replication-competent reservoir, $R^{\\ast}$, and the predicted mean time to viral rebound, $\\mathbb{E}[T]$. According to the provided model, the time to rebound $T$ is the minimum of $R^{\\ast}$ independent exponential waiting times, each with a per-cell reactivation rate of $h$. This implies that the overall reactivation process is a Poisson process with a total rate of $R^{\\ast}h$. The time to the first event in such a process follows an exponential distribution with this rate.\n\nTherefore, $T \\sim \\text{Exponential}(R^{\\ast}h)$. The mean of this distribution is the expected time to rebound:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[T] = \\frac{1}{R^{\\ast}h} $$\nThis fundamental equation shows that the mean time to rebound is inversely proportional to the size of the intact reservoir $R^{\\ast}$. Any error in the measurement of $R^{\\ast}$ will propagate into a biased prediction of $\\mathbb{E}[T]$. Let $\\hat{R}^{\\ast}$ be the estimated reservoir size. The predicted mean time to rebound will be $\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}[T] = \\frac{1}{\\hat{R}^{\\ast}h}$.\n\nWe will now evaluate each statement based on this principle.\n\n**A. Primer–template mismatches in IPDA that reduce $p_{\\text{int}}$ below $1$ cause underestimation of $R^{\\ast}$. When this underestimated $R^{\\ast}$ is used in the Poisson reactivation model, the predicted mean time to rebound is biased upward, overstating cure efficacy.**\n\nThe Intact Proviral DNA Assay (IPDA) aims to measure $R^{\\ast}$. The problem states that $p_{\\text{int}}$ is the probability of detecting a proviral template. If primer–template mismatches occur, some intact proviruses will not be detected, causing $p_{\\text{int}} < 1$. The expected measured count will be an estimate $\\hat{R}^{\\ast}$ that is systematically lower than the true count $R^{\\ast}$ (i.e., $\\hat{R}^{\\ast} \\approx p_{\\text{int}} R^{\\ast} < R^{\\ast}$). This is an **underestimation** of the reservoir.\nUsing this underestimated value in the rebound model gives a predicted mean time $\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}[T] = \\frac{1}{\\hat{R}^{\\ast}h}$. Since $\\hat{R}^{\\ast} < R^{\\ast}$, it follows that $\\frac{1}{\\hat{R}^{\\ast}h} > \\frac{1}{R^{\\ast}h}$, which means $\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}[T] > \\mathbb{E}[T]$. The predicted time to rebound is biased **upward** (predicted to be longer than the true mean). A longer time to rebound is interpreted as a more successful therapeutic outcome, thus **overstating cure efficacy**. The logic is sound.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Using total HIV DNA qPCR as a proxy for $R^{\\ast}$ tends to overestimate the clinically relevant reservoir because $f_{d}$ is typically large. When total HIV DNA is plugged into the Poisson reactivation model as if it were $R^{\\ast}$, the predicted mean time to rebound is biased downward, making interventions appear less effective than they truly are.**\n\nThe problem defines the true intact reservoir as $R^{\\ast} = (1 - f_{d}) R_{\\text{tot}}$, where $R_{\\text{tot}}$ is the total HIV DNA and $f_{d}$ is the large fraction of defective proviruses. Using total HIV DNA as a proxy means we set our estimate $\\hat{R}^{\\ast} = R_{\\text{tot}}$. Since $f_{d}$ is large (e.g., studies show it can be $> 0.95$), $1 - f_{d}$ is small, and thus $R_{\\text{tot}} \\gg R^{\\ast}$. This is a significant **overestimation** of the clinically relevant reservoir.\nThe predicted mean time to rebound is $\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}[T] = \\frac{1}{\\hat{R}^{\\ast}h} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{tot}}h}$. Since $\\hat{R}^{\\ast} > R^{\\ast}$, it follows that $\\frac{1}{\\hat{R}^{\\ast}h} < \\frac{1}{R^{\\ast}h}$, meaning $\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}[T] < \\mathbb{E}[T]$. The predicted time to rebound is biased **downward** (predicted to be shorter than the true mean). A shorter rebound time implies the intervention was less effective at controlling the virus, leading to an unduly pessimistic assessment of its efficacy. The logic is sound.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Because finite-input sampling noise is well-described by Poisson statistics, it systematically biases low the measured IPDA count at small input volumes, thereby making cure strategies look falsely more effective on average.**\n\nThe problem statement explicitly mentions that finite-input sampling \"is unbiased in expectation but increases variance.\" This is a core property of Poisson and binomial sampling. If the true average number of targets in a given sample volume is $\\lambda$, the expected value of a measurement drawn from a Poisson($\\lambda$) distribution is precisely $\\lambda$. While any single measurement may be higher or lower than $\\lambda$, there is no systematic bias in the average measurement over many trials. The statement's claim of a systematic low bias is a direct contradiction of the provided premises and the properties of Poisson sampling. Increased variance can complicate statistical inference, but it does not cause a systematic bias in the mean estimate.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Low-level cross-contamination that contributes an additive background $c > 0$ to measured copy numbers causes a nonzero floor even when the true post-intervention reservoir is very small, biasing measured fold-reductions downward and leading to pessimistic assessments of cure efficacy, especially at low $R^{\\ast}$.**\n\nContamination introduces an additive error, so the measured value is $\\hat{R}^{\\ast} \\approx R^{\\ast}_{\\text{true}} + c$, where $c > 0$. Consider a pre-intervention measurement $\\hat{R}^{\\ast}_{\\text{pre}} = R^{\\ast}_{\\text{pre}} + c$ and a post-intervention measurement $\\hat{R}^{\\ast}_{\\text{post}} = R^{\\ast}_{\\text{post}} + c$. The true fold-reduction is $F_{\\text{true}} = R^{\\ast}_{\\text{pre}} / R^{\\ast}_{\\text{post}}$. The measured fold-reduction is $\\hat{F} = \\hat{R}^{\\ast}_{\\text{pre}} / \\hat{R}^{\\ast}_{\\text{post}} = (R^{\\ast}_{\\text{pre}} + c) / (R^{\\ast}_{\\text{post}} + c)$.\nAssuming an effective intervention, $R^{\\ast}_{\\text{pre}} > R^{\\ast}_{\\text{post}} > 0$. For any $c > 0$, it is a mathematical property that $\\frac{A+c}{B+c} < \\frac{A}{B}$ when $A > B > 0$. Thus, $\\hat{F} < F_{\\text{true}}$. The measured fold-reduction is biased **downward**. A smaller apparent reduction in the reservoir suggests the cure strategy is less effective than it truly is, leading to a **pessimistic assessment**. This effect is most pronounced when $R^{\\ast}_{\\text{post}}$ is small, as the denominator $(R^{\\ast}_{\\text{post}} + c)$ is then dominated by the constant $c$, limiting the maximum achievable fold-reduction measurement. The logic is sound.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. When sequence data are available, deduplicating expanded intact proviral clones to count only unique integration sites yields an unbiased estimate for rebound risk, because the time to first reactivation depends only on the number of unique clones, not on their cellular abundance.**\n\nThe model premise is that \"each intact latent cell reactivates independently as a Poisson process with per-cell rate $h$.\" This means that if a single clone has expanded into $N$ cells, there are $N$ independent sources of reactivation, each contributing a rate $h$ to the total reactivation rate. The total rate is therefore proportional to the total number of cells, $R^{\\ast}$, not the number of unique integration sites. The statement claims rebound risk depends only on the number of unique clones, which directly contradicts the model. Counting only unique clones would lead to an underestimation of the total reactivation rate $R^{\\ast}h$, and thus an overestimation of the time to rebound $\\mathbb{E}[T]$, creating a biased (overly optimistic) prediction.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. Digital droplet partitioning in IPDA eliminates the impact of primer mismatches and amplicon dropout across HIV subtypes, ensuring that IPDA-based predictions of rebound are unbiased regardless of viral diversity.**\n\nThe problem statement specifies that \"digital droplet Polymerase Chain Reaction (ddPCR) readouts ... remain sensitive to primer–template mismatches and amplicon dropout.\" Digital partitioning allows for absolute quantification without reliance on amplification efficiency by counting positive versus negative droplets. However, it cannot make a reaction occur if the primers do not bind to the template in the first place. Primer mismatches, which are more likely with higher viral diversity (i.e., across different subtypes), prevent amplification and lead to false-negative droplets. Therefore, ddPCR does not eliminate this problem; it remains a source of underestimation bias. The statement is factually incorrect based on the provided premises.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**G. In qPCR, unrecognized PCR inhibition that reduces amplification efficiency below $100\\%$ causes undercounting of templates relative to a properly calibrated standard curve, which biases predicted time to rebound upward and overstates cure effect if not corrected.**\n\nIn quantitative PCR (qPCR), the amount of template is inferred from the cycle number at which fluorescence crosses a threshold (Cq). This inference relies on a standard curve generated under ideal conditions (near $100\\%$ efficiency). If an unknown inhibitor in the sample reduces amplification efficiency, it will take more cycles to reach the threshold, resulting in a higher Cq value. When this higher Cq is mapped onto the standard curve, it is interpreted as a lower initial quantity of template. This is **undercounting**.\nIf this undercounted value is used as an estimate for the reservoir size ($\\hat{R}^{\\ast} < R^{\\ast}$), the predicted mean time to rebound $\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}[T] = \\frac{1}{\\hat{R}^{\\ast}h}$ will be greater than the true mean $\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\frac{1}{R^{\\ast}h}$. This is an **upward bias** in the predicted time to rebound, which **overstates the efficacy** of the cure strategy. The entire causal chain is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nIn summary, statements A, B, D, and G are correct descriptions of how measurement errors propagate to biased conclusions about HIV cure strategies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDG}$$", "id": "4705892"}, {"introduction": "Beyond modeling and measuring the system, a key goal of modern virology is to uncover the host mechanisms that control viral latency.

The investigator will expose cells to a submaximal dose of a latency-reversing agent (LRA) to increase sensitivity to subtle changes in host gene activity.\n\nFundamental base and well-tested facts to use:\n- The Central Dogma connects gene expression regulation to cellular phenotypes: transcriptional repression of a host gene reduces its messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein levels, whereas transcriptional activation increases mRNA and protein levels.\n- Viral latency reflects a stable or metastable transcriptionally silent state of the viral genome driven in part by host chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulatory networks.\n- CRISPRi uses dead Cas9 (dCas9) fused to a Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) repressor to reduce transcription near a targeted transcription start site, while CRISPRa uses dCas9 fused to transcriptional activators (for example, VP64-p65-Rta) to increase transcription near a targeted promoter.\n- In pooled genetic screens, low multiplicity of infection (MOI) ensures approximately a single perturbation per cell; fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) can separate phenotypic states, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of single guide ribonucleic acid (sgRNA) barcodes quantifies enrichment or depletion associated with those states.\n- Host genes that maintain latency act as repressive regulators of viral transcription; reducing their function should favor reactivation (more GFP-positive cells), whereas increasing their function should resist reactivation (fewer GFP-positive cells) under identical LRA exposure.\n\nThe investigator plans to sort cells into GFP-positive and GFP-negative fractions after each screen and to call candidate latency-maintaining genes by integrating sgRNA enrichment profiles. Consider the following constraints and definitions:\n- The library contains $10^6$ distinct sgRNAs targeting $2 \\times 10^4$ genes with $50$ sgRNAs per gene plus $10^4$ non-targeting controls. The MOI is set to $0.3$.\n- For each sgRNA $i$, let $C^{+}_{i}$ be the read count in the GFP-positive fraction and $C^{-}_{i}$ be the read count in the GFP-negative fraction. Define the log$_2$ enrichment score by\n$$\nE_{i} = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{C^{+}_{i} / \\sum_{j} C^{+}_{j}}{C^{-}_{i} / \\sum_{j} C^{-}_{j}}\\right).\n$$\n- Gene-level scores are estimated by aggregating sgRNAs per gene using a negative binomial model; false discovery rate (FDR) is controlled at $q \\leq 0.05$ using Benjamini–Hochberg.\n- A parallel viability drop-out screen without sorting estimates essentiality confounders.\n\nWhich option most accurately describes how the combined CRISPRi/CRISPRa screens can identify host factors that maintain latency and proposes scientifically rigorous validation steps for top hits, consistent with the fundamental base and constraints above?\n\nA. Perform both CRISPRi and CRISPRa genome-wide screens at MOI $0.3$ with three biological replicates per modality, include non-targeting and essential-gene controls, and sort under a submaximal LRA dose to yield both GFP-positive and GFP-negative fractions. For a given gene, call it a latency-maintaining factor if its CRISPRi sgRNAs show significantly positive gene-level $E$ scores (enriched in GFP-positive) while its CRISPRa sgRNAs show significantly negative gene-level $E$ scores (depleted in GFP-positive, enriched in GFP-negative), with $q \\leq 0.05$ and no significant drop-out in the viability screen. Validate top hits by orthogonal perturbations (short interfering RNA knockdown and small-molecule inhibition where available), rescue with a complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) refractory to sgRNA binding, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) at the HIV LTR to assess repressive marks (for example, histone $H3K9$ trimethylation) and RNA polymerase II occupancy, single-cell time-lapse microscopy to quantify transition rates between GFP-negative and GFP-positive states, testing generality in primary resting CD4$^+$ T cells from donors, and epistasis mapping with known latency pathways. Exclude hits with significant growth defects or global transcriptional collapse by integrating the viability screen and transcriptome profiling.\n\nB. Use high MOI $> 3$ to ensure multiple sgRNAs per cell and perform only a single CRISPRi screen without an LRA, sorting solely by forward scatter (cell size) to approximate activation state. Identify latency-maintaining genes as those with the greatest raw $C^{+}_{i}$ counts in the GFP-positive fraction. Validate by repeating the same screen once and discarding any hits that alter viability, because such changes necessarily reflect off-target effects.\n\nC. Run only a CRISPRa screen at MOI $0.3$ under a saturating LRA dose that yields nearly $100\\%$ GFP-positive cells. Call latency-maintaining genes as those whose CRISPRa sgRNAs are enriched in GFP-positive cells (large positive $E$) and validate by overexpressing each hit from a strong viral promoter; consider any gene whose overexpression increases GFP positivity as confirmed.\n\nD. Conduct CRISPRi and CRISPRa screens without sorting and infer latency-maintaining genes by measuring bulk transcriptome changes alone, selecting genes with the largest decreases in mRNA under CRISPRi and largest increases under CRISPRa. Validate by overexpressing each hit and measuring interferon-beta secretion as a surrogate for latency disruption, without rescue experiments or chromatin assays, and accept hits even if they show strong essentiality in drop-out.", "solution": "We begin from first principles relevant to viral latency and pooled genetic perturbation screens.\n\nBy the Central Dogma, altering transcription of a host gene changes its mRNA and protein abundance, which can in turn modify downstream regulatory networks. HIV latency is a transcriptionally silent state of the provirus maintained by host factors including chromatin remodelers and transcriptional repressors. If a host factor $G$ actively maintains latency by repressing the HIV LTR, then reducing the function of $G$ should remove repression and enable viral transcription, increasing the fraction of cells that are GFP-positive under a given latency-reversing agent (LRA). Conversely, increasing the function of $G$ should strengthen repression, reducing the GFP-positive fraction.\n\nClustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats interference (CRISPRi) uses a nuclease-inactive Cas9 (dCas9) tethered to a repressor domain (for example, KRAB) guided by an sgRNA to promoter-proximal sites, decreasing transcription near the target. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats activation (CRISPRa) uses dCas9 fused to activator domains (for example, VP64-p65-Rta) to increase transcription near the target promoter. In pooled screens, low multiplicity of infection (MOI) $0.3$ yields mostly single perturbations per cell (Poisson input with mean $0.3$ gives probability of $1$ integration approximately $0.3 e^{-0.3} \\approx 0.22$ and $>1$ integrations rare), minimizing combinatorial confounding.\n\nFluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) separates phenotypic states: GFP-positive indicates viral transcription/reactivation, while GFP-negative indicates continued latency. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of sgRNA barcodes provides counts $C^{+}_{i}$ and $C^{-}_{i}$ per sgRNA $i$ in the GFP-positive and GFP-negative fractions, respectively. The log$_2$ enrichment score\n$$\nE_{i} = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{C^{+}_{i} / \\sum_{j} C^{+}_{j}}{C^{-}_{i} / \\sum_{j} C^{-}_{j}}\\right)\n$$\nquantifies whether sgRNA $i$ is enriched in GFP-positive relative to GFP-negative. Aggregating across sgRNAs targeting the same gene with a negative binomial model and controlling false discovery rate at $q \\leq 0.05$ yields robust gene-level calls. A separate viability drop-out screen identifies essential genes and nonspecific growth effects.\n\nApplying this logic:\n- For a latency-maintaining factor $G$, CRISPRi should reduce $G$ expression, disinhibit the HIV LTR, and increase reactivation. Therefore, sgRNAs targeting $G$ should have $E_{i} > 0$ and the gene-level $E$ score significantly positive (enriched in GFP-positive).\n- Conversely, CRISPRa increasing $G$ expression should strengthen latency and resist LRA, decreasing reactivation. Thus, sgRNAs targeting $G$ should have $E_{i} < 0$ in the GFP-positive fraction (equivalently, enrichment in GFP-negative), and the gene-level $E$ score significantly negative.\n- Hits should be filtered to exclude genes with significant drop-out in the viability screen to avoid confounding by general cytotoxicity or growth defects.\n\nValidation requires orthogonal evidence linking the host gene to viral transcriptional control rather than off-target or global effects. Appropriate validation steps include:\n- Independent perturbations: short interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown and small-molecule inhibition if available, to reproduce the phenotype without CRISPR machinery.\n- cDNA rescue: re-expression of $G$ from a complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) lacking sgRNA target sequences to reverse the CRISPRi phenotype; rescue is a strong specificity control.\n- Chromatin assays at the HIV LTR: chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for repressive histone marks (for example, histone $H3K9$ trimethylation) and RNA polymerase II occupancy to demonstrate mechanistic changes in the viral promoter.\n- Single-cell dynamics: time-lapse microscopy to measure transition rates between GFP-negative and GFP-positive states, providing insight into how $G$ alters the stability of latency versus reactivation.\n- Generality and physiological relevance: testing in primary resting CD4$^+$ T cells from human donors and in additional latency model systems.\n- Pathway positioning: epistasis experiments with known latency regulators to determine whether $G$ acts upstream, downstream, or in parallel.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\nOption A: This describes parallel CRISPRi and CRISPRa screens at MOI $0.3$, with appropriate controls and sorting under a submaximal LRA dose to maintain dynamic range. The calling rule matches the first-principles logic: latency-maintaining genes have positive gene-level $E$ under CRISPRi (more GFP-positive upon repression) and negative gene-level $E$ under CRISPRa (fewer GFP-positive upon activation), with statistical rigor ($q \\leq 0.05$) and exclusion of viability confounders. The validation plan includes orthogonal perturbations, cDNA rescue, mechanistic chromatin assays, single-cell dynamics, testing in primary cells, and epistasis mapping, while integrating viability and transcriptome data to avoid global confounders. This is scientifically sound and consistent with the base principles. Verdict — Correct.\n\nOption B: High MOI $> 3$ introduces multiple sgRNAs per cell, confounding interpretation due to combinatorial effects. Sorting by forward scatter does not specifically measure viral reactivation; it is inappropriate to equate cell size with GFP positivity. Not using an LRA reduces sensitivity; identifying genes by raw $C^{+}_{i}$ counts without normalization or statistical modeling ignores library composition and sampling depth. Validating by repeating the same flawed screen and discarding viability-altering hits as off-target misunderstands that some genuine latency regulators may impact viability, and viability changes require careful integration, not automatic exclusion. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption C: Running only CRISPRa removes the complementary inference provided by CRISPRi. A saturating LRA that yields nearly $100\\%$ GFP-positive cells collapses the dynamic range, making enrichment analysis uninformative (the denominator $C^{-}_{i}$ approaches zero and phenotype differences are masked). Moreover, calling latency-maintaining genes as those enriched in GFP-positive under CRISPRa reverses the correct logic: activating a latency-maintaining gene should decrease GFP positivity, not increase it, hence $E$ should be negative, not positive. Validation by overexpression alone, using a strong viral promoter, can induce nonphysiologic levels and off-target effects and lacks rescue or mechanistic assays. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nOption D: Not sorting eliminates the direct linkage between genotype and the viral phenotype; bulk transcriptome changes alone cannot distinguish whether a gene affects HIV latency specifically versus general transcription. Validating by overexpression and measuring interferon-beta as a surrogate for latency disruption is mechanistically orthogonal and can reflect innate immune activation rather than LTR-specific repression. The lack of rescue and chromatin assays and the acceptance of hits with strong essentiality in drop-out further undermine specificity and robustness. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the option that best adheres to first-principles reasoning about gene regulation, CRISPRi/CRISPRa mechanisms, pooled screen design, and rigorous validation is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4705899"}]}
