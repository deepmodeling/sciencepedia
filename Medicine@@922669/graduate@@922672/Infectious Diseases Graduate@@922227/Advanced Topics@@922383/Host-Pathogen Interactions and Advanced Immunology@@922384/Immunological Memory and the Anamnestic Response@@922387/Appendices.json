The markers $CD45RO$, $CCR7$, and $CD27$ are standard for differentiating T-cell subsets (naive, central memory, effector memory, terminally differentiated). The chemokine receptor $CCR7$ and its ligands CCL19/CCL21 are the canonical system governing T-cell homing to SLOs. The concept of an anamnestic (memory) response involving differential homing and proliferation of T-cell subsets is a cornerstone of vaccinology and infectious disease immunology. All premises are factually sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary information to assign subset identities and predict their behavior. The specific marker combinations and chemokine environments allow for a unique and meaningful solution based on immunological first principles. The question is specific and answerable.\n- **Objective**: The problem uses precise, unbiased, and standard scientific terminology. The data are presented quantitatively. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. The percentages sum to $32 + 18 + 8 + 42 = 100\\%$, indicating a complete and consistent dataset.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## Derivation of Solution\n\nThe solution requires a three-part analysis: 1) identification of the T-cell subsets, 2) prediction of their homing based on chemokine biology, and 3) identification of the primary proliferating population during a recall response.\n\n### 1. T-Cell Subset Identification\n\nCanonical human $CD8^+$ T-cell subsets are defined by the expression of surface markers. We can assign identities to the four populations based on the provided phenotypes:\n\n- **Q1: $CD45RO^+ CCR7^+ CD27^+$**: This phenotype is the definitive signature of **central memory T cells (T$_{\\text{CM}}$)**. T$_{\\text{CM}}$ cells express the memory marker $CD45RO$ and the SLO-homing receptor $CCR7$. They also retain expression of the costimulatory molecule $CD27$.\n\n- **Q2: $CD45RO^+ CCR7^- CD27^+$**: This phenotype describes **effector memory T cells (T$_{\\text{EM}}$)**. Like T$_{\\text{CM}}$, they are memory cells and express $CD45RO$. However, they have lost $CCR7$, precluding them from efficiently entering SLOs, and are poised to migrate to inflamed peripheral tissues. The expression of $CD27$ suggests they are not yet terminally differentiated.\n\n- **Q3: $CD45RO^- CCR7^+ CD27^+$**: This phenotype is characteristic of **naive T cells (T$_{\\text{N}}$)**. These cells have not yet encountered their cognate antigen. They express the naive isoform of CD45, $CD45RA$ (hence, are $CD45RO^-$), and constitutively express $CCR7$ and $CD27$ to mediate recirculation through SLOs. While this phenotype also matches stem cell memory T cells (T$_{\\text{SCM}}$), T$_{\\text{N}}$ is the most common and direct interpretation, and its presence in an antigen-specific repertoire at this frequency is plausible.\n\n- **Q4: $CD45RO^- CCR7^- CD27^-$**: This phenotype represents **terminally differentiated effector memory cells that have re-expressed CD45RA (T$_{\\text{EMRA}}$)**. These cells arise after extensive proliferation, have lost $CCR7$ and $CD27$, and have reverted to expressing $CD45RA$ instead of $CD45RO$. They have potent effector functions but limited proliferative capacity.\n\n### 2. Homing Destinations during the Anamnestic Response ($t \\in [0,48]$ hours)\n\nT-cell trafficking is dictated by the expression of chemokine receptors and the location of their corresponding chemokine ligands.\n\n- **Secondary Lymphoid Organs (SLOs)**: The problem states that SLO T-cell zones express CCL19 and CCL21. The receptor for these chemokines is $CCR7$. Therefore, any cells expressing $CCR7$ will preferentially home to SLOs.\n    - **Q1 (T$_{\\text{CM}}$)** is $CCR7^+$, so it will home to SLOs.\n    - **Q3 (T$_{\\text{N}}$)** is $CCR7^+$, so it will recirculate through SLOs.\n\n- **Inflamed Peripheral Tissues (Respiratory Tract)**: The problem states these tissues have an \"inflammatory chemokine milieu\" but lack CCL19/CCL21. Effector cells (T$_{\\text{EM}}$ and T$_{\\text{EMRA}}$) downregulate $CCR7$ and upregulate receptors for inflammatory chemokines (e.g., $CXCR3$, $CCR5$). Thus, $CCR7^-$ cells are the primary populations that traffic to inflamed non-lymphoid tissues.\n    - **Q2 (T$_{\\text{EM}}$)** is $CCR7^-$, so it will home to the inflamed respiratory tract.\n    - **Q4 (T$_{\\text{EMRA}}$)** is $CCR7^-$, so it will also home to the inflamed respiratory tract.\n\n### 3. Proliferative Burst in Secondary Lymphoid Organs\n\nThe anamnestic response involves a rapid and massive clonal expansion of memory cells to generate a new wave of effector cells. This proliferation primarily occurs in the SLOs where T cells can receive sustained signaling from antigen-presenting cells.\n- **Q1 (T$_{\\text{CM}}$)**: These cells are defined by their ability to home to SLOs (via $CCR7$) and their high proliferative potential. They are the primary source of the proliferative burst that generates secondary effector cells, which then migrate to the site of infection.\n- **Q2 (T$_{\\text{EM}}$)**: These cells preferentially home to the periphery and have a lower proliferative capacity compared to T$_{\\text{CM}}$ cells. Their primary role is immediate effector function at the site of inflammation.\n- **Q3 (T$_{\\text{N}}$)**: These cells would undergo a primary response, which is slower and of lower magnitude than a memory response. They are not the main driver of the rapid anamnestic burst.\n- **Q4 (T$_{\\text{EMRA}}$)**: These cells are terminally differentiated and have very poor proliferative capacity. They contribute to effector function but not to the major proliferative burst.\n\nTherefore, the subset **Q1 (T$_{\\text{CM}}$)** is expected to undergo the major proliferative burst in SLOs that seeds secondary effectors into the lung by days $3$–$5$.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Q1 are central memory T cells, Q2 are effector memory T cells, Q3 are naive T cells, and Q4 are terminally differentiated effector memory cells that have re-expressed CD45RA. During $t \\in [0,48]$ hours, Q1 home predominantly to secondary lymphoid organ T-cell zones, Q2 and Q4 preferentially traffic to inflamed peripheral tissues (including the respiratory mucosa), and Q3 recirculate through lymph nodes. The major proliferative burst in lymph nodes that subsequently seeds secondary effectors to the lung by days $3$–$5$ is primarily driven by Q1.**\n- **Subset Identities**: Correct, as derived above.\n- **Homing**: Correct. Q1 ($CCR7^+$) and Q3 ($CCR7^+$) traffic to SLOs. Q2 ($CCR7^-$) and Q4 ($CCR7^-$) traffic to the inflamed periphery.\n- **Proliferative Burst**: Correct. The major proliferative burst is driven by Q1 (T$_{\\text{CM}}$).\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option aligns perfectly with all three parts of the analysis based on fundamental immunological principles.\n\n**B.

During $t \\in [0,48]$ hours, Q1 and Q2 both home to peripheral inflamed tissues because CD45RO expression is the key determinant of peripheral homing, while Q3 and Q4 are retained in blood. The major proliferative burst in lymph nodes by days $3$–$5$ is driven by Q2.**\n- **Subset Identities**: Incorrect. Q1 ($CCR7^+$) is T$_{\\text{CM}}$, not T$_{\\text{EM}}$. Q2 ($CCR7^-$) is T$_{\\text{EM}}$, not T$_{\\text{CM}}$. Q4 ($CD45RO^-CCR7^-...$) is T$_{\\text{EMRA}}$, not T$_{\\text{N}}$.\n- **Homing**: Incorrect. The reasoning that $CD45RO$ expression determines peripheral homing is false; chemokine receptors determine homing. Q1 (T$_{\\text{CM}}$) homes to SLOs, not the periphery.\n- **Proliferative Burst**: Incorrect. The proliferative burst is driven by T$_{\\text{CM}}$ (Q1), not Q2 (T$_{\\text{EM}}$).\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.

During $t \\in [0,48]$ hours, all CCR7$^{+}$ subsets (Q1 and Q3) are excluded from lymph nodes due to competition with effectors and instead enter the inflamed lung, whereas CCR7$^{-}$ subsets (Q2 and Q4) remain in circulation. The major proliferative burst in lymph nodes by days $3$–$5$ is driven by Q2.**\n- **Subset Identities**: Mostly plausible, although \"exhausted central memory\" is non-standard terminology for the Q4 phenotype.\n- **Homing**: Fundamentally incorrect. $CCR7^+$ cells are not excluded from lymph nodes; they are actively recruited to them. The claim that they enter the inflamed lung is also wrong, as the lung tissue lacks the $CCR7$ ligands CCL19/CCL21. The claim that $CCR7^-$ cells remain in circulation is also wrong; they are the ones that enter the inflamed lung.\n- **Proliferative Burst**: Incorrect. The burst is driven by T$_{\\text{CM}}$ (Q1), not T$_{\\text{EM}}$ (Q2).\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Q1 are central memory T cells, Q2 are effector memory T cells, Q3 are naive T cells, and Q4 are terminally differentiated effector memory cells that have re-expressed CD45RA. During $t \\in [0,48]$ hours, all CD27$^{+}$ subsets (Q1, Q2, and Q3) home to lymph nodes regardless of CCR7 status, whereas CD27$^{-}$ cells (Q4) preferentially home to lymph nodes due to high adhesion, making Q4 the principal driver of the proliferative burst that seeds secondary effectors by days $3$–$5$.**\n- **Subset Identities**: Correct, same as option A.\n- **Homing**: Incorrect.

Serum collected at $t=0$, day $7$, day $28$, and day $90$.\n- Pseudovirus $ID_{50}$ geometric mean titers (GMT):\n  - Wuhan-Hu-1: $400$ at $t=0$; $3{,}200$ at day $7$; $4{,}800$ at day $28$; $3{,}600$ at day $90$.\n  - BA.5: $100$ at $t=0$; $300$ at day $7$; $500$ at day $28$; $700$ at day $90$.\n- RBD competition epitope mapping (fraction of total RBD-binding serum activity assigned to each class):\n  - At $t=0$: class $1/2 = 0.58$, class $3 = 0.27$, class $4 = 0.15$.\n  - Day $28$: class $1/2 = 0.62$, class $3 = 0.24$, class $4 = 0.14$.\n  - Day $90$: class $1/2 = 0.60$, class $3 = 0.25$, class $4 = 0.15$.\n- Deep mutational scanning (DMS) escape profiling:\n  - Minimal gain in serum binding to BA.5-unique mutated residues relative to $t=0$; escape maps remain dominated by substitutions at ancestral class $1/2$ contact residues.\n- Single-cell memory B cell data at day $90$:\n  - Among spike-binding IgG clones, fraction previously observed post-second dose (recalled) $= 0.72$; de novo clones with Immunoglobulin Heavy Variable (IGHV) usage not previously detected $= 0.28$.\n  - Median IGHV somatic hypermutation $= 18$ nucleotide changes.\n  - Cross-reactivity to both Wuhan-Hu-1 and BA.5 detected in $85\\%$ of monoclonal antibodies tested.\n\nQuestion: Which interpretation is best supported by these longitudinal serologic and epitope-binding data?\n\nA. The variant booster elicited a recall dominated by pre-existing memory targeting ancestral class $1/2$ RBD epitopes, with limited recruitment of variant-unique specificities; this pattern is consistent with immune imprinting biasing the anamnestic response.\n\nB. The observed increases in BA.5 neutralization at all time points demonstrate a variant-focused response and therefore argue against immune imprinting.\n\nC. Persistence of class $1/2$ dominance reflects that these epitopes are fully conserved between Wuhan-Hu-1 and BA.5, so the data indicate optimal targeting rather than imprinting.\n\nD. The data support early imprinting at day $7$, but by day $90$ show substantial remodeling toward variant-unique epitopes, indicating that imprinting was overcome during maturation.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness, clarity, and completeness.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n- **Cohort and History:** A cohort of $n=36$ adults, primed with two doses of ancestral-strain mRNA vaccine at $t=-10$ and $t=-7$ months. They received an Omicron BA.4/5 variant-matched booster at $t=0$. Participants had no recent infection.\n- **Measurements and Time Points:** Serum was collected at $t=0$, day $7$, day $28$, and day $90$. Data include pseudovirus neutralization, receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitope competition mapping, deep mutational scanning (DMS), and single-cell B cell analysis.\n- **Fundamental Principles:** The problem provides a base for reasoning including:\n    1.  **Anamnestic Response:** Rapid response from memory cells (e.g., by day $7$) vs. delayed de novo response (e.g., >$14$ days).\n    2.  **Immune Imprinting (Original Antigenic Sin):** Prior exposure biases recall toward original epitopes, potentially limiting responses to new variant epitopes.\n    3.  **Neutralization Titers ($ID_{50}$):** Reflect functional antibody levels.\n    4.  **Epitope Mapping:** Infers which epitopes (e.g., class $1/2$, $3$, $4$) dominate the serum response.\n    5.  **Single-Cell Analysis:** Identifies recalled vs. de novo B cell clones.\n- **Experimental Results:**\n    - **Pseudovirus $ID_{50}$ Geometric Mean Titers (GMT):**\n        - Wuhan-Hu-1: $400$ ($t=0$), $3{,}200$ (day $7$), $4{,}800$ (day $28$), $3{,}600$ (day $90$).\n        - BA.5: $100$ ($t=0$), $300$ (day $7$), $500$ (day $28$), $700$ (day $90$).\n    - **RBD Competition Epitope Mapping (% total activity):**\n        - At $t=0$: class $1/2 = 0.58$, class $3 = 0.27$, class $4 = 0.15$.\n        - At day $28$: class $1/2 = 0.62$, class $3 = 0.24$, class $4 = 0.14$.\n        - At day $90$: class $1/2 = 0.60$, class $3 = 0.25$, class $4 = 0.15$.\n    - **Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) Escape Profiling:** Minimal gain in serum binding to BA.5-unique mutated residues. Escape maps are dominated by substitutions at ancestral class $1/2$ contact residues.\n    - **Single-Cell Memory B Cell Data (day $90$):**\n        - Fraction of spike-binding IgG clones that are recalled: $0.72$.\n        - Fraction of de novo clones: $0.28$.\n        - Median Immunoglobulin Heavy Variable (IGHV) somatic hypermutation: $18$ nucleotide changes.\n        - Fraction of monoclonal antibodies with cross-reactivity to both Wuhan-Hu-1 and BA.5: $0.85$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in contemporary immunology and virology, specifically concerning SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses. The experimental design (longitudinal analysis of neutralization, epitope specificity, and B cell repertoire) is standard methodology in the field. The concepts of anamnestic response, immune imprinting, neutralization, and epitope mapping are fundamental principles. The provided data are quantitatively and qualitatively consistent with published scientific literature on bivalent mRNA vaccine boosters.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a comprehensive set of complementary data and asks for the most plausible interpretation among a set of choices. The data are sufficient to logically deduce a conclusion.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is objective, presenting experimental data and established principles without subjective language or bias.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed to derive the solution and evaluate the options.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe question asks for the best interpretation of the provided data. A systematic analysis of each data type is required.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Neutralization Titers:**\n    - The response to the ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 strain is rapid and potent. The geometric mean titer (GMT) increases $8$-fold by day $7$ (from $400$ to $3{,}200$). This kinetic profile is the hallmark of an anamnestic (memory) response, as defined in the provided principles.\n    - The response to the booster-matched BA.5 variant is substantially weaker. The GMT increases only $3$-fold by day $7$ (from $100$ to $300$). At its peak (day $28$/$90$), the BA.5 titer ($500$-$700$) is nearly an order of magnitude lower than the peak Wuhan-Hu-1 titer ($4,800$).\n    - This large discrepancy, where a BA.5-matched booster elicits a much stronger response against an ancestral strain than against the variant it is designed to target, is strong evidence for immune imprinting. The immune system is preferentially recalling memory B cells that target the original (ancestral) antigen.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Epitope Mapping:**\n    - The epitope distribution of serum antibodies is remarkably stable over the $90$-day period. At all time points, the response is dominated by antibodies targeting class $1/2$ RBD epitopes (fraction of activity is $0.58$ at $t=0$, $0.62$ at day $28$, and $0.60$ at day $90$).\n    - If the booster had successfully elicited a strong de novo response against BA.5, one would expect a significant shift in the epitope landscape, likely with an increase in antibodies targeting epitopes that are conserved in BA.5 but less immunogenic or present in the ancestral strain, or new specificities altogether. The lack of such a shift indicates that the booster expanded the pre-existing pool of class $1/2$-directed antibodies.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS):**\n    - This result is definitive: \"minimal gain in serum binding to BA.5-unique mutated residues\" and \"escape maps remain dominated by substitutions at ancestral class $1/2$ contact residues.\" This directly states that the polyclonal antibody response after boosting is not effectively targeting the new mutations present in BA.5. Its functional profile remains focused on the original ancestral epitopes, reinforcing the conclusions from the neutralization and epitope mapping data.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Single-Cell B Cell Data:**\n    - At day $90$, a large majority ($72\\%$, or a fraction of $0.72$) of spike-binding B cell clones are \"recalled,\" meaning they were present in the memory compartment from the primary vaccination series. Only a minority ($28\\%$) are de novo. This provides direct molecular confirmation that the response is dominated by memory recall.\n    - The high level of somatic hypermutation ($18$ nucleotide changes) is characteristic of mature memory B cells that have undergone extensive affinity maturation in response to the ancestral antigen.\n    - The high degree of cross-reactivity ($85\\%$) explains the modest rise in BA.5 neutralization: the recalled, ancestrally-imprinted B cells produce antibodies that can still bind, albeit sub-optimally, to the BA.5 spike.\n\n**Conclusion from Integrated Data:** All four lines of evidence consistently point to a single conclusion: the BA.4/5 booster response is overwhelmingly dominated by the recall of pre-existing memory B cells generated against the ancestral vaccine. This recalled response remains focused on the original antigenic sites (class $1/2$ RBD epitopes), with limited induction of new B cell responses targeting variant-specific epitopes. This phenomenon is precisely defined as immune imprinting (or original antigenic sin).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The variant booster elicited a recall dominated by pre-existing memory targeting ancestral class $1/2$ RBD epitopes, with limited recruitment of variant-unique specificities; this pattern is consistent with immune imprinting biasing the anamnestic response.**\n- This statement accurately synthesizes all the data.\n    - \"recall dominated by pre-existing memory\": Confirmed by the rapid Wuhan-Hu-1 neutralization kinetics and the single-cell data showing $72\\%$ of clones are recalled.\n    - \"targeting ancestral class $1/2$ RBD epitopes\": Confirmed by the stable epitope mapping showing class $1/2$ dominance and the DMS data.\n    - \"limited recruitment of variant-unique specificities\": Confirmed by the weak BA.5 neutralization, the DMS data, and the low proportion ($28\\%$) of de novo B cell clones.\n    - \"consistent with immune imprinting\": This is the correct immunological term for this entire pattern.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The observed increases in BA.5 neutralization at all time points demonstrate a variant-focused response and therefore argue against immune imprinting.**\n- This statement is flawed. While BA.5 neutralization does increase, calling it a \"variant-focused response\" is a severe misinterpretation. The response is overwhelmingly focused on the ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, as shown by the much higher GMTs against it ($4,800$ vs. $500$ at day $28$). This large discrepancy is evidence *for*, not against, immune imprinting. The modest increase in BA.5 neutralization is a consequence of cross-reactive memory recall, not a new variant-focused response.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Persistence of class $1/2$ dominance reflects that these epitopes are fully conserved between Wuhan-Hu-1 and BA.5, so the data indicate optimal targeting rather than imprinting.**\n- This statement is based on a false premise. The class $1/2$ epitopes on the RBD are known to be sites of significant mutation in Omicron variants like BA.5 (e.g., L452R, F486V). The problem text itself implies this by referencing \"BA.5-unique mutated residues\". If the epitopes were \"fully conserved\" and targeting was \"optimal,\" the neutralization titers for Wuhan-Hu-1 and BA.5 should be comparable. The data show a nearly $10$-fold difference in peak titers, directly contradicting the idea of optimal targeting of conserved epitopes. The persistence of targeting these mutation-containing epitopes despite poor neutralization of the new variant is a key feature of imprinting.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The data support early imprinting at day 7, but by day 90 show substantial remodeling toward variant-unique epitopes, indicating that imprinting was overcome during maturation.**\n- The first part of the statement, \"data support early imprinting at day 7,\" is correct. The subsequent part, \"by day 90 show substantial remodeling toward variant-unique epitopes,\" is directly falsified by the evidence. The epitope mapping at day $90$ shows no remodeling, with class $1/2$ dominance preserved. The DMS data show minimal new specificity. The single-cell data at day $90$ still show a response dominated by recalled clones ($72\\%$). The BAL.5 neutralization titer remains low. There is no evidence that imprinting was \"overcome\".\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4654097"}]}
