To support decisions on library-scale High-Throughput Screening (HTS), you must quantify the plate-level assay quality using the screening $Z'$-factor, defined under the standard HTS framework as a measure of the separation between positive and negative control signal distributions. Assume that replicate control measurements are independent draws from approximately normal distributions and that the unbiased sample variances provided are appropriate estimators of the corresponding population variances.\n\nOn one plate, the negative control (vehicle only) and positive control (a bactericidal reference compound at a concentration sufficient to maximize kill) were each assayed in $n = 64$ wells.

The $Z'$-factor is a standard and widely accepted metric for quantifying the quality of HTS assays, first described by Zhang, Chung, and Oldenburg in 1999. The context of antimicrobial drug discovery is appropriate. The given values for means and variances are plausible for a luminescence-based biological assay. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data to calculate the defined metric. The language is objective and free of ambiguity. All assumptions are explicitly stated. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe $Z'$-factor is a statistical parameter used in HTS to evaluate the quality of an assay. It provides a dimensionless measure of the separation between the signal distributions of the positive and negative controls. A larger separation indicates a more robust and reliable assay. The definition, as alluded to in the problem statement by referencing \"three-standard-deviation decision bands,\" is based on the means and standard deviations of the two control populations.\n\nLet $\\mu_{\\mathrm{neg}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{neg}}$ be the population mean and standard deviation of the negative control, and let $\\mu_{\\mathrm{pos}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{pos}}$ be the population mean and standard deviation for the positive control. The $Z'$-factor is defined as:\n$$Z' = 1 - \\frac{3(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{pos}} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{neg}})}{|\\mu_{\\mathrm{neg}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{pos}}|}$$\nThe term $3(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{pos}} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{neg}})$ represents the sum of three standard deviations from the mean of each control, defining the dynamic range of the control signals. The term $|\\mu_{\\mathrm{neg}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{pos}}|$ is the separation between the means of the control populations.\n\nThe problem provides sample statistics, not population parameters. It is stated that the unbiased sample variances ($s^{2}$) are appropriate estimators of the population variances ($\\sigma^{2}$), and by extension, the sample means ($\\bar{x}$) are estimators of the population means ($\\mu$). Therefore, we can substitute the sample statistics into the formula:\n$$Z' = 1 - \\frac{3(s_{\\mathrm{pos}} + s_{\\mathrm{neg}})}{|\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{neg}} - \\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{pos}}|}$$\nwhere $s_{\\mathrm{pos}}$ and $s_{\\mathrm{neg}}$ are the sample standard deviations, which are the square roots of the given sample variances.\n\nThe provided statistics are:\n- $\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{neg}} = 1.050 \\times 10^{4}$\n- $s_{\\mathrm{neg}}^{2} = 5.625 \\times 10^{5}$\n- $\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{pos}} = 1.800 \\times 10^{3}$\n- $s_{\\mathrm{pos}}^{2} = 3.600 \\times 10^{5}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the sample standard deviations, $s_{\\mathrm{neg}}$ and $s_{\\mathrm{pos}}$.\nFor the negative control:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{neg}} = \\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{neg}}^{2}} = \\sqrt{5.625 \\times 10^{5}} = \\sqrt{562500} = 750$$\nFor the positive control:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{pos}} = \\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{pos}}^{2}} = \\sqrt{3.600 \\times 10^{5}} = \\sqrt{360000} = 600$$\n\nNext, we calculate the terms required for the $Z'$-factor formula.\nThe sum of the standard deviations is:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{pos}} + s_{\\mathrm{neg}} = 600 + 750 = 1350$$\nThe absolute difference of the sample means is:\n$$|\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{neg}} - \\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{pos}}| = |(1.050 \\times 10^{4}) - (1.800 \\times 10^{3})| = |10500 - 1800| = 8700$$\nNote that for a cell viability assay, the negative control (vehicle only) is expected to have a high signal (high viability) and the positive control (bactericidal compound) is expected to have a low signal (low viability), which is consistent with the provided data ($\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{neg}} > \\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{pos}}$).\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the $Z'$-factor equation:\n$$Z' = 1 - \\frac{3(1350)}{8700}$$\n$$Z' = 1 - \\frac{4050}{8700}$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$Z' = 1 - \\frac{405}{870} = 1 - \\frac{81}{174} = 1 - \\frac{27}{58}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$Z' \\approx 1 - 0.46551724...$$\n$$Z' \\approx 0.53448275...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The fourth significant digit is a $4$, so we round down.\n$$Z' \\approx 0.534$$\n\n### Assessment of Assay Suitability\nThe final step is to assess the assay's suitability for HTS based on the calculated $Z'$-factor. The widely used interpretive framework is as follows:\n- $Z' = 1$: An ideal assay with no variance.\n- $0.5 \\leq Z' < 1$: An excellent assay, suitable for HTS.\n- $0 < Z' < 0.5$: A marginal assay, which may require optimization or be used for focused screens.\n- $Z' \\leq 0$: An unusable assay, as there is no separation between the control distributions.\n\nOur calculated value is $Z' \\approx 0.534$. Since $0.534 \\geq 0.5$, the assay is classified as excellent. It demonstrates a sufficient separation window between the positive and negative controls to reliably distinguish between hits and non-hits.

Based on the problem's definition, the $\\mathrm{SI}$ is calculated as:\n$$ \\mathrm{SI} = \\frac{\\text{Toxicity Concentration}}{\\text{Efficacy Concentration}} = \\frac{HC_{10}}{\\mathrm{MIC}} $$\nFor this ratio to be a dimensionless quantity, both concentrations must be expressed in the same units. The given values are $\\mathrm{MIC} = 4.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ (a molar concentration) and $HC_{10} = 0.240\\ \\mathrm{mg/mL}$ (a mass concentration).
