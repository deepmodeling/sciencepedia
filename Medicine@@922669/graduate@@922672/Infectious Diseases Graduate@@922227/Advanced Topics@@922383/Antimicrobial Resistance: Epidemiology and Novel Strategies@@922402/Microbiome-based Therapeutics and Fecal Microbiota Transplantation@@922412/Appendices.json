To mitigate the risk of post-procedure bacteremia and transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms, the program screens candidates for rectal colonization with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales using a polymerase chain reaction assay. Let the true prevalence of colonization among this FMT candidate cohort be denoted by $p$, the assay sensitivity by $Se$ (the probability of a positive test given true colonization), and the assay specificity by $Sp$ (the probability of a negative test given no colonization). A particular candidate’s screening result is positive.

Do not perform any numerical substitutions or rounding, and do not include units.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of two quantities related to a diagnostic screening test: the posterior probability of true colonization given a positive test and the residual risk of a false positive. We will start from the fundamental principles of probability theory as requested.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $C$: The event that a candidate is truly colonized with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales.\n- $C^c$: The complementary event that a candidate is not colonized.\n- $T^+$: The event that the screening assay result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the screening assay result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n- The true prevalence of colonization, $P(C) = p$.\n- The assay sensitivity, the probability of a positive test given true colonization, $P(T^+ | C) = Se$.\n- The assay specificity, the probability of a negative test given no colonization, $P(T^- | C^c) = Sp$.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can derive other relevant probabilities. The probability of not being colonized is the complement of the prevalence:\n$$P(C^c) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - p$$\nThe probability of a positive test given no colonization (a false positive event) is the complement of the specificity:\n$$P(T^+ | C^c) = 1 - P(T^- | C^c) = 1 - Sp$$\n\nThe first objective is to derive a closed-form expression for the posterior probability of true colonization given a positive test. This quantity is denoted by $P(C | T^+)$. We will use Bayes' theorem, which is derived from the definition of conditional probability.\n\nThe definition of conditional probability states:\n$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nApplying this to our problem:\n$$P(C | T^+) = \\frac{P(C \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe numerator, $P(C \\cap T^+)$, is the joint probability of being truly colonized and testing positive. We can re-express this using the definition of conditional probability for $P(T^+ | C)$:\n$$P(T^+ | C) = \\frac{P(C \\cap T^+)}{P(C)}$$\nRearranging gives:\n$$P(C \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | C) \\cdot P(C)$$\nSubstituting the given symbols:\n$$P(C \\cap T^+) = Se \\cdot p$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test. We find this using the Law of Total Probability. The event space can be partitioned by the events $C$ and $C^c$. Therefore, the probability of a positive test $P(T^+)$ is the sum of the probabilities of a positive test in each partition:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap C) + P(T^+ \\cap C^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | C) \\cdot P(C) + P(T^+ | C^c) \\cdot P(C^c)$$\nSubstituting the known expressions:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se \\cdot p) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - p))$$\n\nNow we combine the numerator and the denominator to find the final expression for the posterior probability $P(C | T^+)$, also known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV):\n$$P(C | T^+) = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{(Se \\cdot p) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - p))}$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the probability of true colonization given a positive test.\n\nThe second objective is to define and derive an expression for the residual risk that a positive screening result represents a false positive.\nThis risk is defined as the probability that a candidate is not colonized, given that their test result was positive. In our notation, this is the conditional probability $P(C^c | T^+)$.\n\nWe can derive this expression in two ways. First, by recognizing that given a positive test result ($T^+$), a candidate is either truly colonized ($C$) or not colonized ($C^c$). These are mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes. Therefore:\n$$P(C | T^+) + P(C^c | T^+) = 1$$\nSolving for the desired quantity:\n$$P(C^c | T^+) = 1 - P(C | T^+)$$\nSubstituting the expression we derived for $P(C | T^+)$:\n$$P(C^c | T^+) = 1 - \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{(Se \\cdot p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator:\n$$P(C^c | T^+) = \\frac{((Se \\cdot p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)) - (Se \\cdot p)}{(Se \\cdot p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}$$\n$$P(C^c | T^+) = \\frac{(1 - Sp)(1 - p)}{(Se \\cdot p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the risk of a false positive. This quantity is also known as the False Discovery Rate.\n\nAlternatively, we could have derived $P(C^c | T^+)$ directly using Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(C^c | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | C^c) \\cdot P(C^c)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe numerator is $P(T^+|C^c) \\cdot P(C^c) = (1-Sp) \\cdot (1-p)$. The denominator $P(T^+)$ is the same as derived before. This yields the identical result, confirming our derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for two expressions: the posterior probability of true colonization given a positive test, and the residual risk of a false positive. These are $P(C|T^+)$ and $P(C^c|T^+)$ respectively.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{p \\cdot Se}{p \\cdot Se + (1-p)(1-Sp)}  \\frac{(1-p)(1-Sp)}{p \\cdot Se + (1-p)(1-Sp)} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4666237"}, {"introduction": "Once a patient is deemed a safe candidate for FMT, the next challenge is to maximize the likelihood of a successful therapeutic outcome.

The study is designed to detect an absolute difference $\\Delta = p_1 - p_0$.\n\nFirst, we define the statistical hypotheses. The null hypothesis, $H_0$, posits no difference between the arms, while the alternative hypothesis, $H_A$, posits a difference of $\\Delta$. For a two-sided test, these are:\n$$H_0: p_1 - p_0 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad p_1 = p_0$$\n$$H_A: p_1 - p_0 \\neq 0$$\nThe study is being powered to detect a specific alternative, $p_1 - p_0 = \\Delta$.\n\nLet $n_1$ and $n_0$ be the sample sizes in the FMT and standard-of-care arms.
