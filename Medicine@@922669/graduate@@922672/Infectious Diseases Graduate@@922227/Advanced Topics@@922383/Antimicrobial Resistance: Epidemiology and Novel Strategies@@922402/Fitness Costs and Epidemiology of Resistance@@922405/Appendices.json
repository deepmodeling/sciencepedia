The definition of the selection coefficient as a relative difference in Malthusian growth rates is a fundamental concept in evolutionary biology and population genetics. The provided growth rate values are realistic. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear definition of the quantity to be estimated ($s$), all necessary data ($r_r$ and $r_s$), and a clear set of tasks. A unique and meaningful solution can be derived directly from the provided information.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe problem defines the selection coefficient, $s$, of the resistant strain as the proportional difference in its Malthusian growth rate, $r_r$, compared to that of the susceptible strain, $r_s$, relative to the susceptible baseline, $r_s$. This verbal definition is formalized as a mathematical expression. The difference in growth rates is $r_r - r_s$. The proportional difference relative to the susceptible baseline $r_s$ is this difference divided by $r_s$.\n\nTherefore, the estimator for the selection coefficient $s$ is:\n$$s = \\frac{r_r - r_s}{r_s}$$\nThis expression can also be written as:\n$$s = \\frac{r_r}{r_s} - 1$$\nThis is the required estimator for $s$ expressed solely in terms of $r_r$ and $r_s$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $s$ using the provided observed growth rates: $r_s = 0.28 \\text{ day}^{-1}$ and $r_r = 0.238 \\text{ day}^{-1}$. Substituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$s = \\frac{0.238 - 0.28}{0.28}$$\n$$s = \\frac{-0.042}{0.28}$$\n$$s = -0.15$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact value is $-0.15$, which has two significant figures. To express this with four significant figures, we append two zeros.\n$$s = -0.1500$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the resistant strain has a lower Malthusian growth rate than the susceptible strain in the environment where these measurements were taken. This represents a selective disadvantage.\n\n### Minimal Epidemiological Conditions for Validity\n\nFor this estimator, $s = (r_r - r_s)/r_s$, to be a valid measure of a resistance-associated fitness cost, certain epidemiological conditions must be met, which stem directly from the model's assumptions.\n\n1.  **Low Disease Prevalence:** The exponential growth model $N_i(t) = N_i(0)\\exp(r_i t)$ is an accurate approximation only when the fraction of the host population that is susceptible is nearly constant. This condition holds during the early stages of an epidemic when prevalence is low, and thus susceptible depletion is negligible.\n\n2.  **Absence of Selective Pressure:** The term \"fitness cost\" of resistance specifically refers to a reduction in a pathogen's intrinsic fitness due to the resistance mechanism, measured in an environment *without* the selective agent (e.g., the drug). Therefore, for the calculated negative value of $s$ to represent a fitness *cost*, the growth rates $r_s$ and $r_r$ must have been measured in a host population that was not undergoing treatment with the drug to which the $r$ strain is resistant. If treatment were widespread, the resistant strain would likely have a selective *advantage* ($s > 0$), and $s$ would measure the benefit of resistance in the presence of the drug, not its intrinsic cost.\n\n3.  **Identical Epidemiological Context:** The estimator assumes that the only systematic difference influencing the per-capita growth rates of the two strains is the genetic locus conferring resistance. This requires that both strains be co-circulating within the same well-mixed population, subject to the same contact patterns, host immune responses, and other ecological factors. The problem's specification that the data were \"collected over the same calendar window\" from a \"well-mixed host population\" supports this condition.\n\nIn summary, the minimal conditions are: low disease prevalence, absence of the relevant drug treatment in the host population, and a shared, homogeneous epidemiological environment for both strains.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.1500}$$", "id": "4643675"}, {"introduction": "A fitness advantage does not guarantee survival for a new resistant mutant, especially when its population size is small and subject to random events.

In the absence of treatment, a drug-resistant genotype incurs a fitness cost relative to the wild type and has negative net growth. Under treatment, the wild type is suppressed and the resistant genotype experiences a slight advantage such that, while population density is still low and resource limitation is negligible, the early dynamics of the resistant lineage can be approximated by a continuous-time linear birth–death branching process: each resistant individual independently gives birth at per capita rate $b$ and dies at per capita rate $d$, with $bd$.

Express your final answer as an integer count (no units).

The dynamics of the resistant lineage are described by a continuous-time linear birth–death process with per capita birth rate $b$ and death rate $d$, where $b  d$. We are required to derive the solution from first principles.\n\nLet $N(t)$ be the number of resistant individuals at time $t$. The problem defines establishment as non-extinction. We begin by deriving the probability of ultimate extinction for a lineage starting with a single individual, $N(0)=1$. Let $P_{k}(t) = \\mathrm{Pr}(N(t)=k | N(0)=1)$. The probability of extinction by time $t$ is $P_0(t)$. We seek the ultimate probability of extinction, $\\pi_0 = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} P_0(t)$.\n\nWe can derive a differential equation for $P_0(t)$ using a first-principles argument. Consider a small time interval $\\Delta t$. A lineage starting with one individual at time $t=0$ will be extinct by time $t+\\Delta t$ in one of two ways:\n1. The initial individual dies in the interval $(0, \\Delta t]$. The probability of this is $d \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)$. The lineage is then extinct.\n2. The initial individual gives birth in $(0, \\Delta t]$. The probability of this is $b \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)$. The population size becomes $2$. For the entire lineage to go extinct by time $t+\\Delta t$, both resulting sub-lineages must go extinct in the remaining time, $t$. As the sub-lineages evolve independently, the probability of this is $(P_0(t))^2$.\n3. The initial individual neither gives birth nor dies in $(0, \\Delta t]$. The probability is $1 - (b+d)\\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)$. The lineage must then go extinct in the remaining time $t$, with probability $P_0(t)$.\n\nSumming these disjoint possibilities, the total probability of extinction by time $t+\\Delta t$ is:\n$$P_0(t+\\Delta t) = d \\Delta t + b \\Delta t [P_0(t)]^2 + [1 - (b+d)\\Delta t] P_0(t) + o(\\Delta t)$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\\frac{P_0(t+\\Delta t) - P_0(t)}{\\Delta t} = d + b [P_0(t)]^2 - (b+d) P_0(t) + \\frac{o(\\Delta t)}{\\Delta t}$$\nTaking the limit as $\\Delta t \\to 0$, we obtain the differential equation for the probability of extinction, which we denote $p_e(t) \\equiv P_0(t)$:\n$$\\frac{dp_e}{dt} = b p_e^2 - (b+d)p_e + d$$\nThe initial condition is $p_e(0) = 0$, since the population cannot be extinct at the very beginning if it starts with one individual. The ultimate probability of extinction, $\\pi_0$, is the steady-state solution of this equation as $t \\to \\infty$. This corresponds to a stable fixed point of the dynamics. The fixed points are found by setting $\\frac{dp_e}{dt} = 0$:\n$$b \\pi_0^2 - (b+d)\\pi_0 + d = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $\\pi_0$, which can be factored as:\n$$(b\\pi_0 - d)(\\pi_0 - 1) = 0$$\nThe two fixed points are $\\pi_0 = 1$ and $\\pi_0 = \\frac{d}{b}$.\n\nSince the problem states $b  d$, we have $0  \\frac{d}{b}  1$. To determine which fixed point is the correct one for the ultimate probability of extinction starting from $p_e(0)=0$, we analyze the sign of $\\frac{dp_e}{dt}$. The function $f(p_e) = (bp_e - d)(p_e - 1)$ is a parabola opening upwards. For $p_e \\in (0, d/b)$, we have $bp_e - d  0$ and $p_e - 1  0$, so $\\frac{dp_e}{dt} = f(p_e)  0$. This means that if the system starts at $p_e(0)=0$, the probability of extinction will increase over time, approaching the first fixed point it encounters, which is the stable fixed point at $\\pi_0 = d/b$. The fixed point $\\pi_0=1$ is unstable for initial conditions $p_e  1$. Thus, the ultimate probability of extinction for a lineage starting with one individual is:\n$$\\pi_0 = \\frac{d}{b}$$\n\nNow, we consider a starting population of $n_0$ resistant individuals. Since each individual's lineage evolves independently in a linear birth-death process, the entire population goes extinct if and only if all $n_0$ independent lineages go extinct. The probability of this event, $P_{ext}(n_0)$, is the product of the individual extinction probabilities:\n$$P_{ext}(n_0) = (\\pi_0)^{n_0} = \\left(\\frac{d}{b}\\right)^{n_0}$$\nThe probability of establishment, $P_{est}(n_0)$, is the complement of the probability of extinction:\n$$P_{est}(n_0) = 1 - P_{ext}(n_0) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{d}{b}\\right)^{n_0}$$\nWe are asked to find the minimal integer $n_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ such that the probability of establishment is at least $0.90$. This gives the inequality:\n$$P_{est}(n_{\\mathrm{crit}}) \\ge 0.90$$\n$$1 - \\left(\\frac{d}{b}\\right)^{n_{\\mathrm{crit}}} \\ge 0.90$$\nRearranging the inequality:\n$$\\left(\\frac{d}{b}\\right)^{n_{\\mathrm{crit}}} \\le 0.10$$\nTo solve for $n_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. Since $b  d$, we have $0  d/b  1$, which means $\\ln(d/b)$ is a negative number.
