We can verify this: $\\sum p_i^H = 0.28 + 0.22 + 0.18 + 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.08 = 1.00$. For the diseased state, $\\sum p_i^D = 0.55 + 0.10 + 0.09 + 0.08 + 0.10 + 0.08 = 1.00$.\n- The task is to derive the appropriate expression for community entropy for a discrete distribution from the foundational axioms of information theory: continuity, symmetry, expansibility, and the composition law.\n- The derivation must use the natural logarithm.\n- The task requires computation of the entropy for both distributions, $H(p^{H})$ and $H(p^{D})$, and their absolute difference $\\Delta H = H(p^{H}) - H(p^{D})$.\n- The final numerical answer for $\\Delta H$ must be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n- A brief interpretation of the results is required.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in microbiology and clinical infectious diseases. Using Shannon entropy to quantify ecological diversity, such as in the gut microbiome, is a standard and well-established method. The concept of dysbiosis in CDI characterized by reduced diversity is scientifically accurate.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined with all necessary data provided. The distributions are valid probability distributions. The axioms listed (continuity, symmetry, expansibility, composition) are the classical axioms used in information theory (e.g., by A. I. Khinchin) to uniquely derive the functional form of entropy. The tasks are specific and lead to a unique, meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated objectively using precise numerical data and mathematical tasks. It is free from subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be constructed.\n\n**Derivation of the Entropy Expression**\nThe objective is to find a function, $H$, that quantifies the uncertainty (or information content) associated with a discrete probability distribution $p = (p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n)$, where $p_i \\ge 0$ for all $i$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i = 1$. The function $H(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n)$ must satisfy the axioms provided:\n1.  **Continuity**: $H$ must be a continuous function of its arguments $p_i$. Small changes in probabilities should result in small changes in entropy.\n2.  **Symmetry**: $H$ must be invariant under any permutation of its arguments. For instance, $H(p_1, p_2) = H(p_2, p_1)$. This means the uncertainty depends only on the set of probabilities, not on which outcome is associated with which probability.\n3.  **Expansibility**: Adding an event with zero probability does not change the entropy: $H(p_1, \\ldots, p_n, 0) = H(p_1, \\ldots, p_n)$.\n4.  **Composition Law (Additivity/Grouping)**: The uncertainty of a joint event is the sum of the uncertainty of the primary event and the weighted average of the uncertainties of the subsequent conditional events. For a system with outcomes partitioned into groups, the total entropy is the entropy of the groups plus the weighted average of the entropies within the groups.\n\nThese axioms, along with a normalization condition, uniquely determine the form of the entropy function. The general solution that satisfies these axioms is:\n$$H(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n) = -k \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \\log_b(p_i)$$\nwhere $k$ is a positive constant and $b$ is the base of the logarithm. The problem specifies the use of the natural logarithm, so $b = e$. The standard convention in this context, which arises naturally from the axioms, is to set the constant of proportionality $k=1$. This yields the Shannon entropy, measured in \"nats\":\n$$H(p) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \\ln(p_i)$$\nBy convention, the term $p_i \\ln(p_i)$ is taken to be $0$ if $p_i = 0$, which is consistent with the limit $\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} x \\ln(x) = 0$. This expression represents the community entropy for a discrete distribution as required.\n\n**Interpretation of Entropy in Ecology**\nIn the context of community ecology and the human microbiome, this entropy is a measure of biological diversity. It takes into account both the number of distinct entities (richness, here fixed at $6$ guilds) and their relative abundances (evenness). Higher entropy values correspond to communities where abundance is more evenly distributed among the guilds, while lower entropy values indicate communities dominated by one or a few guilds. A healthy gut microbiome is generally characterized by high diversity (high evenness), which is associated with stability and resilience. Dysbiosis, as seen in CDI, is often marked by a loss of diversity and the overgrowth of specific taxa, leading to a less even and lower entropy distribution.\n\n**Computation of Entropies**\nWe now apply the derived formula to the given distributions.\n\nFor the healthy distribution $p^{H} = (0.28, 0.22, 0.18, 0.12, 0.12, 0.08)$:\n$$H(p^{H}) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{6} p_i^{H} \\ln(p_i^{H})$$\n$$H(p^{H}) = -[0.28 \\ln(0.28) + 0.22 \\ln(0.22) + 0.18 \\ln(0.18) + 2 \\times 0.12 \\ln(0.12) + 0.08 \\ln(0.08)]$$\nCalculating the terms:\n- $0.28 \\ln(0.28) \\approx 0.28 \\times (-1.272965) \\approx -0.356430$\n- $0.22 \\ln(0.22) \\approx 0.22 \\times (-1.514126) \\approx -0.333108$\n- $0.18 \\ln(0.18) \\approx 0.18 \\times (-1.714798) \\approx -0.308664$\n- $2 \\times 0.12 \\ln(0.12) \\approx 0.24 \\times (-2.120264) \\approx -0.508863$\n- $0.08 \\ln(0.08) \\approx 0.08 \\times (-2.525729) \\approx -0.202058$\nSumming these values:\n$$ \\sum p_i^{H} \\ln(p_i^{H}) \\approx -0.356430 - 0.333108 - 0.308664 - 0.508863 - 0.202058 = -1.709123 $$\n$$H(p^{H}) = -(-1.709123) \\text{ nats} \\approx 1.7091 \\text{ nats}$$\n\nFor the diseased distribution $p^{D} = (0.55, 0.10, 0.09, 0.08, 0.10, 0.08)$:\n$$H(p^{D}) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{6} p_i^{D} \\ln(p_i^{D})$$\n$$H(p^{D}) = -[0.55 \\ln(0.55) + 2 \\times 0.10 \\ln(0.10) + 0.09 \\ln(0.09) + 2 \\times 0.08 \\ln(0.08)]$$\nCalculating the terms:\n- $0.55 \\ln(0.55) \\approx 0.55 \\times (-0.597837) \\approx -0.328810$\n- $2 \\times 0.10 \\ln(0.10) \\approx 0.20 \\times (-2.302585) \\approx -0.460517$\n- $0.09 \\ln(0.09) \\approx 0.09 \\times (-2.407946) \\approx -0.216715$\n- $2 \\times 0.08 \\ln(0.08) \\approx 0.16 \\times (-2.525729) \\approx -0.404117$\nSumming these values:\n$$ \\sum p_i^{D} \\ln(p_i^{D}) \\approx -0.328810 - 0.460517 - 0.216715 - 0.404117 = -1.410159 $$\n$$H(p^{D}) = -(-1.410159) \\text{ nats} \\approx 1.4102 \\text{ nats}$$\n\nThe computed entropy for the healthy community ($H(p^{H}) \\approx 1.7091$) is higher than for the diseased community ($H(p^{D}) \\approx 1.4102$). This quantifies the observation that the healthy distribution is more even, whereas the diseased distribution is dominated by a single guild (at $55\\%$ abundance), indicative of dysbiosis. The higher entropy reflects greater diversity and a more balanced ecosystem, which is characteristic of health.\n\n**Computation of the Absolute Difference**\nThe absolute difference in entropy is $\\Delta H = H(p^{H}) - H(p^{D})$.\n$$\\Delta H \\approx 1.709123 - 1.410159 = 0.298964$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get:\n$$\\Delta H \\approx 0.2990$$\nThis positive value represents the loss of community diversity (specifically, evenness) in the diseased state compared to the healthy state.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2990}$$", "id": "4698853"}, {"introduction": "While diversity indices provide a summary snapshot, a deeper comparison between microbial communities requires methods that respect the compositional nature of sequencing data.

It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of compositional data analysis as applied to microbiome research, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of the Aitchison distance between two microbiome samples and an explanation of the method's scientific appropriateness. The provided data are the read count vectors for $5$ dominant genera from two samples: pre-antibiotic and post-FMT.\n\nLet the count vector for the pre-antibiotic sample be $C_1$ and for the post-FMT sample be $C_2$. The number of components (genera) is $D=5$.\nThe vectors are given as:\n$C_1 = \\big(3200, 800, 400, 1600, 1000\\big)$\n$C_2 = \\big(1600, 2400, 1200, 400, 800\\big)$\n\nThe problem statement outlines a three-step process:\n1. Convert counts to compositions (proportions).\n2. Apply the centered log-ratio (CLR) transformation.\n3. Compute the Aitchison distance as the Euclidean distance between the CLR-transformed vectors.\n\nA key property of the CLR transformation is its scale invariance. The CLR transform of a count vector $C = (c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_D)$ is identical to the CLR transform of its corresponding compositional vector $X = (x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_D)$, where $x_i = c_i / \\sum_j c_j$. This is because for any scaling factor $k > 0$:\n$$ \\text{clr}(kC)_i = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k c_i}{g(kC)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k c_i}{k \\cdot g(C)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_i}{g(C)}\\right) = \\text{clr}(C)_i $$\nwhere $g(C)$ is the geometric mean of the components of $C$. This property allows us to bypass the explicit conversion to proportions and apply the CLR transform directly to the raw count vectors, which simplifies the calculation.\n\nThe Aitchison distance $d_A$ between the two samples is defined as the Euclidean norm of the difference between their CLR-transformed vectors:\n$$ d_A(C_1, C_2) = \\left\\| \\text{clr}(C_1) - \\text{clr}(C_2) \\right\\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{D} \\left( \\text{clr}(C_1)_i - \\text{clr}(C_2)_i \\right)^2} $$\nThe $i$-th component of the difference vector is:\n$$ \\text{clr}(C_1)_i - \\text{clr}(C_2)_i = \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{1,i}}{g(C_1)}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{2,i}}{g(C_2)}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{1,i}}{c_{2,i}}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{g(C_1)}{g(C_2)}\\right) $$\nLet us define a vector of log-ratios of counts, $Z$, with components $z_i = \\ln(c_{1,i} / c_{2,i})$. The term $\\ln(g(C_1)/g(C_2))$ can be shown to be the arithmetic mean of the $z_i$ components:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{g(C_1)}{g(C_2)}\\right) = \\ln(g(C_1)) - \\ln(g(C_2)) = \\frac{1}{D}\\sum_{j=1}^{D}\\ln(c_{1,j}) - \\frac{1}{D}\\sum_{j=1}^{D}\\ln(c_{2,j}) = \\frac{1}{D}\\sum_{j=1}^{D}\\ln\\left(\\frac{c_{1,j}}{c_{2,j}}\\right) = \\bar{z} $$\nTherefore, the difference vector is simply $z_i - \\bar{z}$. The squared Aitchison distance is the sum of squares of these centered values:\n$$ d_A^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{D} (z_i - \\bar{z})^2 $$\nWe now compute this quantity. First, we find the ratios $r_i = c_{1,i} / c_{2,i}$:\n$r_1 = 3200 / 1600 = 2$\n$r_2 = 800 / 2400 = 1/3$\n$r_3 = 400 / 1200 = 1/3$\n$r_4 = 1600 / 400 = 4$\n$r_5 = 1000 / 800 = 1.25$\n\nNext, we take the natural logarithm of these ratios to obtain the components $z_i$:\n$z_1 = \\ln(2) \\approx 0.69315$\n$z_2 = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3) \\approx -1.09861$\n$z_3 = \\ln(1/3) = -\\ln(3) \\approx -1.09861$\n$z_4 = \\ln(4) = 2\\ln(2) \\approx 1.38629$\n$z_5 = \\ln(1.25) \\approx 0.22314$\n\nNow we compute the arithmetic mean, $\\bar{z}$:\n$$ \\bar{z} = \\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{i=1}^{5} z_i = \\frac{1}{5} (\\ln(2) - \\ln(3) - \\ln(3) + \\ln(4) + \\ln(1.25)) $$\n$$ \\bar{z} = \\frac{1}{5} \\ln\\left( \\frac{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 1.25}{3 \\cdot 3} \\right) = \\frac{1}{5} \\ln\\left( \\frac{10}{9} \\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{5}(0.10536) \\approx 0.02107 $$\nNow we compute the terms $(z_i - \\bar{z})$:\n$z_1 - \\bar{z} \\approx 0.69315 - 0.02107 = 0.67208$\n$z_2 - \\bar{z} \\approx -1.09861 - 0.02107 = -1.11968$\n$z_3 - \\bar{z} \\approx -1.09861 - 0.02107 = -1.11968$\n$z_4 - \\bar{z} \\approx 1.38629 - 0.02107 = 1.36522$\n$z_5 - \\bar{z} \\approx 0.22314 - 0.02107 = 0.20207$\n\nFinally, we compute the squared Aitchison distance by summing the squares of these values:\n$$ d_A^2 \\approx (0.67208)^2 + (-1.11968)^2 + (-1.11968)^2 + (1.36522)^2 + (0.20207)^2 $$\n$$ d_A^2 \\approx 0.45169 + 1.25368 + 1.25368 + 1.86383 + 0.04083 \\approx 4.86371 $$\nThe Aitchison distance is the square root of this value:\n$$ d_A = \\sqrt{4.86371} \\approx 2.20538 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the distance is $2.205$.\n\nThe explanation for the scientific appropriateness of this metric is as follows. Microbiome sequencing data are compositional, meaning the measurements for each taxon are relative abundances within a sample, not absolute counts. The total number of reads (sequencing depth) is a technical artifact of the sequencing process and does not reflect the total microbial load. A scientifically valid metric must therefore be invariant to this total sum, a property known as scale invariance. Naive Euclidean distance calculated on raw proportions ($x_i = c_i / \\sum c_j$) is not scale invariant in a meaningful way and suffers from statistical issues related to the `closure` property (the fact that proportions must sum to $1$). This unit-sum constraint induces spurious negative correlations between components, rendering the standard Euclidean geometry of real space inappropriate for the simplex on which compositions lie.\n\nThe Aitchison geometry resolves these issues. The foundational insight is that the relevant information in compositional data is contained in the log-ratios of the components (e.g., $x_i/x_j$). The centered log-ratio (CLR) transform `opens` the simplex by mapping the compositional data from the constrained simplex to an unconstrained real vector space. As demonstrated in the calculation, this transformation (and thus the resulting Aitchison distance) is inherently scale-invariant: it yields the same result whether applied to raw counts or to proportions. By analyzing log-ratios, the Aitchison framework properly handles the relative nature of the data and removes the artifacts of the closure constraint. The Aitchison distance is simply the standard Euclidean distance in this valid, transformed space. This makes it a robust and theoretically sound metric for quantifying the degree of change between microbial community structures, such as the shift from dysbiosis to a restored state post-FMT.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.205}$$", "id": "4698813"}, {"introduction": "Beyond describing and comparing microbiome states, a key goal is to understand the dynamic mechanisms that confer stability and resist infection.

We analyze the initial growth rate of the pathogen by evaluating its per capita growth rate, $\\frac{1}{P}\\frac{dP}{dt}$, in the limit where $P \\to 0$ and the commensal is at its equilibrium, $C = C^*$.\nThe pathogen dynamics are given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} \\;=\\; r_{P}\\,P\\left(1 - \\frac{P + \\alpha_{PC} C}{K_{P}}\\right) \\;-\\; \\delta\\,P\n$$\nThe per capita growth rate is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{P}\\frac{dP}{dt} \\;=\\; r_{P}\\left(1 - \\frac{P + \\alpha_{PC} C}{K_{P}}\\right) \\;-\\; \\delta\n$$\nThe initial per capita growth rate of the pathogen, or its invasion fitness $\\lambda_P$, is found by setting $P=0$ and $C=C^*$:\n$$\n\\lambda_P \\;=\\; \\left. \\frac{1}{P}\\frac{dP}{dt} \\right|_{P \\to 0, C=C^*} \\;=\\; r_{P}\\left(1 - \\frac{0 + \\alpha_{PC} C^*}{K_{P}}\\right) \\;-\\; \\delta\n$$\nSo, the invasion fitness is:\n$$\n\\lambda_P \\;=\\; r_{P}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{PC} C^*}{K_{P}}\\right) \\;-\\; \\delta\n$$\nThe pathogen can successfully invade if its initial net growth rate is positive, i.e., $\\lambda_P > 0$.\n$$\nr_{P}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{PC} C^*}{K_{P}}\\right) \\;-\\; \\delta \\; > \\; 0\n$$\n$$\nr_{P}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{PC} C^*}{K_{P}}\\right) \\; > \\; \\delta\n$$\nThe minimum intrinsic growth rate for invasion, $r_{P}^{\\min}$, is the value of $r_P$ for which the invasion fitness is exactly zero, representing the threshold between population decline and growth.\n$$\nr_{P}^{\\min}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{PC} C^*}{K_{P}}\\right) - \\delta \\;=\\; 0\n$$\nSolving for $r_{P}^{\\min}$ gives:\n$$\nr_{P}^{\\min} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\delta}{1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{PC} C^*}{K_{P}}}\n$$\nThis solution is valid provided that the denominator is positive, i.e., $1 - \\frac{\\alpha_{PC} C^*}{K_{P}} > 0$. If the denominator is negative or zero, it means that the competition from the resident commensal is so strong that the pathogen's effective carrying capacity is zero or negative, making invasion impossible regardless of the intrinsic growth rate $r_P$.\n\nLet's check this condition with the given values:\n- $C^* = 0.75$\n- $\\alpha_{PC} = 0.75$\n- $K_P = 0.8$\nThe term $\\frac{\\alpha_{PC} C^*}{K_{P}}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{0.75 \\times 0.75}{0.8} \\;=\\; \\frac{0.5625}{0.8} \\;=\\; 0.703125\n$$\nSince $0.703125 < 1$, the denominator is positive, and a finite $r_{P}^{\\min}$ exists.\n\nNow we can calculate $r_{P}^{\\min}$:\n$$\nr_{P}^{\\min} \\;=\\; \\frac{0.4}{1 - 0.703125} \\;=\\; \\frac{0.4}{0.296875}\n$$\n$$\nr_{P}^{\\min} \\approx 1.34736842...\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\nr_{P}^{\\min} \\approx 1.347\n$$\nThe units of $r_{P}^{\\min}$ are the same as $r_P$, which is per day.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.347}$$", "id": "4698835"}]}
