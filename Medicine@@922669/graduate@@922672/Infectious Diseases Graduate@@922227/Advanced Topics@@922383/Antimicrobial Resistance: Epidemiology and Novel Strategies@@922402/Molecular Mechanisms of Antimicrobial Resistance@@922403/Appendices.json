The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and assumptions (thermodynamic values, temperature, proportionality between MIC and $K_d$) to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and the data are physically realistic.\n\nThe solution proceeds by relating the macroscopic measure of antibiotic efficacy, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration ($MIC$), to the microscopic thermodynamics of drug-target binding, described by the standard Gibbs free energy of binding ($\\Delta G^{\\circ}$).\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relationship between the standard Gibbs free energy of a binding process and its equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is given by:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln(K_a) $$\nwhere $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $K_a$ is the association constant.

This time can be modeled as the sum of two distinct phases:\n1.  $T_{\\mathrm{wait}}$: The stochastic waiting time for the first successful compensatory mutation to arise and establish in the population (i.e., escape stochastic loss).\n2.  $T_{\\mathrm{sweep}}$: The deterministic time it takes for this single successful mutant to increase in frequency from $p_{0} = 1/N$ to the target frequency of $p_{f} = 0.5$.\n\n$$T_{\\mathrm{total}} = T_{\\mathrm{wait}} + T_{\\mathrm{sweep}}$$\n\nFirst, we must quantify the fitness effects of the mutations based on the provided exponential growth rates (Malthusian parameters).\n\n**1. Quantify Fitness and Selection Coefficients**\n\nThe problem asks to first quantify the relative fitness cost of the $rpoB$ resistance mutation. In a continuous-time model, the Malthusian parameter $m$ is the measure of fitness. The fitness of the resistant mutant ($r$) relative to the wild type ($WT$) is $w_{r} = m_{r}/m_{\\mathrm{WT}}$. The fitness cost, or selection coefficient against the resistant strain, is $s_{\\mathrm{cost}}$.\n\n$$s_{\\mathrm{cost}} = 1 - w_{r} = 1 - \\frac{m_{r}}{m_{\\mathrm{WT}}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{r}}{m_{\\mathrm{WT}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{cost}} = \\frac{0.92\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} - 0.73\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}}{0.92\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.19}{0.92} \\approx 0.2065$$\n\nNext, we determine the fitness of the compensated mutant ($comp$). The compensatory mutation alleviates a fraction $f$ of the fitness cost. The cost can be seen as the absolute reduction in growth rate, $\\Delta m = m_{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{r}$. The growth rate of the compensated mutant, $m_{\\mathrm{comp}}$, is therefore:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{comp}} = m_{r} + f \\cdot (m_{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{r})$$\nThe selective advantage of the compensated mutant relative to the resistant background is what drives its spread. We define two related selection coefficients:\n- The absolute selective advantage in growth rate, $s'$, which governs the deterministic frequency change:\n  $$s' = m_{\\mathrm{comp}} - m_{r} = f \\cdot (m_{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{r})$$\n- The relative selection coefficient, $s_{\\mathrm{comp}}$, which is used to calculate the fixation probability:\n  $$s_{\\mathrm{comp}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{comp}} - m_{r}}{m_{r}} = \\frac{s'}{m_{r}}$$\n\n**2. Calculate the Waiting Time ($T_{\\mathrm{wait}}$)**\n\nThe waiting time for the first successful mutation is the reciprocal of the rate of appearance of successful mutations, $\\lambda$.\n$$T_{\\mathrm{wait}} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$$\nThe rate $\\lambda$ is the product of three terms: the total number of births per unit time, the mutation rate per birth, and the probability that a new mutant fixes.\n$$\\lambda = (\\text{Total Birth Rate}) \\times (\\text{Mutation Rate}) \\times (\\text{Fixation Probability})$$\n- **Total Birth Rate**: In a chemostat with constant population size $N$, the per-capita birth rate must equal the per-capita death (dilution) rate. For the resistant population, this rate is $m_{r}$. The total number of births per hour is $N \\cdot m_{r}$.\n- **Mutation Rate**: The rate to a compensatory allele is given as $U_{c}$.\n- **Fixation Probability ($P_{\\mathrm{fix}}$)**: The problem specifies using the \"classic small-selection approximation for haploid, asexual populations,\" which is Haldane's result, $P_{\\mathrm{fix}} \\approx 2s$. The relevant selection coefficient here is the relative fitness advantage, $s_{\\mathrm{comp}}$.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{fix}} \\approx 2 s_{\\mathrm{comp}} = 2 \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{comp}} - m_{r}}{m_{r}}$$\nWe note that $s_{\\mathrm{comp}} = (0.70 \\cdot (0.92-0.73))/0.73 \\approx 0.182$, which is not infinitesimally small. However, we proceed as directed by the problem's explicit instruction.\n\nCombining these terms, the rate of successful mutations is:\n$$\\lambda = (N \\cdot m_{r}) \\cdot U_{c} \\cdot \\left(2 \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{comp}} - m_{r}}{m_{r}}\\right) = 2 N U_{c} (m_{\\mathrm{comp}} - m_{r})$$\nUsing the expression for $m_{\\mathrm{comp}} - m_{r}$:\n$$\\lambda = 2 N U_{c} f (m_{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{r})$$\nThe waiting time is then:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{wait}} = \\frac{1}{2 N U_{c} f (m_{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{r})}$$\n\n**3. Calculate the Sweep Time ($T_{\\mathrm{sweep}}$)**\n\nOnce a successful lineage is established, its frequency $p(t)$ increases deterministically. The dynamics of allele frequency under continuous-time selection in a constant-size population are described by the logistic equation:\n$$\\frac{dp}{dt} = (m_{\\mathrm{comp}} - m_{\\text{resident}}) p (1-p)$$\nIn the chemostat, the resident growth rate is effectively the mean population growth rate, which adjusts to maintain constant $N$. The differential growth advantage is $m_{\\mathrm{comp}} - m_{r} = s'$.\n$$\\frac{dp}{dt} = s' p (1-p)$$\nWe solve this differential equation by separating variables and integrating from the initial frequency $p_{0} = 1/N$ at $t=0$ to the final frequency $p_{f}=0.5$ at $t=T_{\\mathrm{sweep}}$:\n$$\\int_{p_{0}}^{p_{f}} \\frac{dp}{p(1-p)} = \\int_{0}^{T_{\\mathrm{sweep}}} s' dt$$\nThe integral on the left is $\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)$.\n$$\\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) \\right]_{p_{0}}^{p_{f}} = s' T_{\\mathrm{sweep}}$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{sweep}} = \\frac{1}{s'} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{f}}{1-p_{f}}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{0}}{1-p_{0}}\\right) \\right]$$\nSubstituting $s' = f(m_{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{r})$, $p_{0} = 1/N$, and $p_{f} = 0.5$:\n$$\\frac{p_{f}}{1-p_{f}} = \\frac{0.5}{1-0.5} = 1$$\n$$\\frac{p_{0}}{1-p_{0}} = \\frac{1/N}{1 - 1/N} = \\frac{1/N}{(N-1)/N} = \\frac{1}{N-1}$$\nThus,\n$$T_{\\mathrm{sweep}} = \\frac{1}{f(m_{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{r})} \\left[ \\ln(1) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{N-1}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{f(m_{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{r})} \\left[ 0 - (-\\ln(N-1)) \\right]$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{sweep}} = \\frac{\\ln(N-1)}{f(m_{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{r})}$$\n\n**4. Calculate Total Time ($T_{\\mathrm{total}}$)**\n\nWe sum the expressions for $T_{\\mathrm{wait}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{sweep}}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{1}{2 N U_{c} f (m_{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{r})} + \\frac{\\ln(N-1)}{f(m_{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{r})}$$\nFactoring out the common term gives the final analytical expression:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{1}{f(m_{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{r})} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2 N U_{c}} + \\ln(N-1) \\right]$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $m_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 0.92\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- $m_{r} = 0.73\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- $f = 0.70$\n- $U_{c} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-8}$\n- $N = 3.0 \\times 10^{7}$\n\nFirst, calculate the term $f(m_{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{r})$:\n$$f(m_{\\mathrm{WT}} - m_{r}) = 0.70 \\times (0.92 - 0.73) = 0.70 \\times 0.19 = 0.133\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\n\nNext, calculate the terms inside the brackets:\n$$\\frac{1}{2 N U_{c}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{7}) \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{-8})} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 1.2} = \\frac{1}{2.4}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2.4} \\approx 0.41667$$\n$$\\ln(N-1) = \\ln(3.0 \\times 10^{7} - 1) = \\ln(29999999) \\approx 17.21656$$\n\nNow, substitute these into the expression for $T_{\\mathrm{total}}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{total}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.133} [0.41667 + 17.21656] = \\frac{17.63323}{0.133} \\approx 132.58065\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{total}} \\approx 132.6\\,\\mathrm{h}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{132.6}$$", "id": "4668474"}]}
