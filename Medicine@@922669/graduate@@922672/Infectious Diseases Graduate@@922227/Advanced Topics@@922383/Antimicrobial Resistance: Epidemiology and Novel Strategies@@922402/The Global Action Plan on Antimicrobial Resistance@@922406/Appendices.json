Two core indicators aligned with the plan are to be computed for a recent one-year period of duration $365$ days: (i) the consumption intensity of a specific reserve-class antibiotic measured as Defined Daily Doses (DDD) per $1{,}000$ inhabitants per day, and (ii) the health impact of reduced mortality measured as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted. Use the following foundational epidemiological and burden-of-disease definitions as your starting point:\n\n- The Defined Daily Dose (DDD) is a standardized measure of drug consumption. A rate per person per unit time is, by definition, the total quantity over the period divided by the product of the population and the duration of observation. The DDD per $1{,}000$ inhabitants per day is the per-person-per-day rate scaled by $1{,}000$.\n- Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) combine Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature mortality and Years Lived with Disability (YLD), with the identity $\\text{DALY} = \\text{YLL} + \\text{YLD}$.

All provided information is based on established concepts such as Defined Daily Doses (DDD) and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) as used by the World Health Organization. The problem is a direct application of these definitions to a realistic, albeit hypothetical, scenario.\n\nThe task is to compute two indicators: (i) the consumption intensity of an antibiotic, denoted here as $X$, and (ii) the health impact from reduced mortality, denoted as $Y$. The final answer is to be presented as an ordered pair $(X, Y)$, with numerical results rounded to four significant figures.\n\nFirst, we compute the consumption intensity, $X$, defined as the number of Defined Daily Doses (DDD) per $1,000$ inhabitants per day.\n\nThe problem provides the following definition: the DDD per $1,000$ inhabitants per day is the per-person-per-day rate scaled by $1,000$. The per-person-per-day rate is defined as the total quantity consumed over the period divided by the product of the population and the duration of observation.\n\nLet $C_{total}$ be the total consumption in DDDs, $P$ be the population size, and $T$ be the duration of the observation period in days. The formula for $X$ is:\n$$X = \\left( \\frac{C_{total}}{P \\times T} \\right) \\times 1,000$$\n\nThe given values are:\n- Total consumption, $C_{total} = 1,000,000$ DDD\n- Population, $P = 10,000,000$ inhabitants\n- Duration, $T = 365$ days\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$X = \\left( \\frac{1,000,000}{10,000,000 \\times 365} \\right) \\times 1,000$$\nWe can simplify the expression:\n$$X = \\left( \\frac{1}{10 \\times 365} \\right) \\times 1,000 = \\frac{100}{365}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$X \\approx 0.2739726...$$\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to four significant figures. The fifth significant digit is $7$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$X \\approx 0.2740 \\text{ DDD per } 1,000 \\text{ inhabitants per day}$$\n\nNext, we compute the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted, $Y$.\n\nThe problem defines DALYs as the sum of Years of Life Lost (YLL) and Years Lived with Disability (YLD):\n$$\\text{DALY} = \\text{YLL} + \\text{YLD}$$\nConsequently, the DALYs averted, which we denote as $Y$, is the sum of YLL averted and YLD averted:\n$$Y = \\Delta \\text{YLL} + \\Delta \\text{YLD}$$\nThe problem states to assume no change in YLD, which means $\\Delta \\text{YLD} = 0$. Therefore, the DALYs averted are equal to the YLL averted:\n$$Y = \\Delta \\text{YLL}$$\nThe problem defines Years of Life Lost as $\\text{YLL} = N \\times L$, where $N$ is the number of deaths and $L$ is the standard life expectancy at the age of death (given as YLL per death).\n\nThe given values for this calculation are:\n- Number of averted deaths, $N_{averted} = 500$\n- YLL per averted death, $L = 20$ years\n\nThe total YLL averted is the product of the number of averted deaths and the YLL per death:\n$$\\Delta \\text{YLL} = N_{averted} \\times L$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$Y = 500 \\times 20 = 10,000$$\nThe result is $10,000$ DALYs averted, expressed in units of years. The problem requires the numerical answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $10,000$ is an exact integer. To express this value with four significant figures unambiguously, we can use scientific notation. A value of $10,000$ can be represented as $1.000 \\times 10^4$ to explicitly show four significant figures.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $(X, Y)$, where $X$ is the DDD per $1,000$ inhabitants per day and $Y$ is the DALYs averted.\n- $X = 0.2740$\n- $Y = 10,000$ (expressed as $1.000 \\times 10^4$ for four significant figures)\n\nThus, the ordered pair is $(0.2740, 1.000 \\times 10^4)$.

This exercise uses a foundational concept from mathematical epidemiology to model how improving hand hygiene—a core strategy for infection prevention and control—can reduce the transmission of resistant pathogens like MRSA. By working through this hypothetical scenario [@problem_id:4698586], you will see how simple models can be used to set quantitative targets for interventions and guide resource allocation in healthcare settings.", "problem": "A core objective of the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance is to strengthen infection prevention and control through hand hygiene to reduce transmission of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. Consider a hospital unit with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) transmission that can be represented by a mass-action infection process with compartments for susceptible individuals and infectious carriers. Let the per-contact transmission parameter be denoted by $\\beta_{0}$ in the absence of any intervention, the recovery (or decolonization) rate be $\\gamma$, and the population size be approximately constant. The basic reproduction number (commonly denoted $R_{0}$) is defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical primary case in a fully susceptible population, and in this setting satisfies $R_{0}=\\beta_{0}/\\gamma$ under standard assumptions.\n\nAssume that hand hygiene compliance is implemented at level $c \\in [0,1]$, where $c$ is the fraction of indicated hand-hygiene opportunities that are correctly performed. Assume further that, over a short time horizon during which the sizes of the susceptible and infectious compartments can be treated as approximately constant, the intervention scales the transmission parameter linearly as $\\beta(c)=\\left(1-c\\right)\\beta_{0}$, reflecting a proportional mitigation of hand-mediated transmission. The instantaneous incidence rate at time $t$ is proportional to the force of infection $\\lambda(t)=\\beta(c)\\,I(t)/N$, so that the incidence scales linearly with $\\beta(c)$ on this time horizon.\n\nIf the baseline basic reproduction number is $R_{0}=1.6$, determine the minimum compliance level $c^{\\ast}$ that achieves at least a one-half reduction in the instantaneous incidence relative to baseline. Express $c^{\\ast}$ as a decimal (do not use a percent sign). No rounding instruction is required if the value is exact.", "solution": "The problem is first subjected to a validation analysis.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Model: Mass-action infection process with susceptible and infectious compartments.\n- Baseline transmission parameter: $\\beta_{0}$.\n- Recovery rate: $\\gamma$.\n- Population size: $N$, approximately constant.\n- Hand hygiene compliance level: $c \\in [0,1]$.\n- Relationship between transmission parameter and compliance: $\\beta(c) = (1-c)\\beta_{0}$.\n- Baseline basic reproduction number: $R_{0} = \\beta_{0}/\\gamma = 1.6$.\n- Assumption: The analysis is over a short time horizon where the infectious compartment size, $I(t)$, is approximately constant.\n- Instantaneous incidence rate definition: The problem states it is proportional to the force of infection, $\\lambda(t) = \\beta(c)I(t)/N$.\n- Objective: Determine the minimum compliance level, denoted $c^{\\ast}$, that results in at least a one-half reduction in the instantaneous incidence relative to the baseline (no-intervention) case.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, employing a standard framework from mathematical epidemiology. The linear scaling of the transmission parameter with compliance, $\\beta(c)=(1-c)\\beta_0$, is a plausible simplifying assumption for modeling the effect of an intervention like hand hygiene. The definitions and relationships are mathematically precise. The provided data, including $R_0 = 1.6$ for MRSA, is realistic. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. The inclusion of the $R_0$ value, while not required for the specific calculation requested, does not create a contradiction and presents a realistic scenario where not all provided data may be necessary for every sub-problem. The problem is therefore well-posed and admits a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A reasoned solution follows.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nLet the instantaneous incidence rate be denoted by $J(c)$, where $c$ is the hand hygiene compliance level. The problem states that $J(c)$ is proportional to the force of infection, $\\lambda(t)$.\nThe force of infection is given as $\\lambda(t)=\\beta(c)I(t)/N$. Thus, for some proportionality constant $k0$:\n$$\nJ(c) = k \\cdot \\lambda(t) = k \\frac{\\beta(c) I(t)}{N}\n$$\nThe transmission parameter $\\beta(c)$ is given by the relation:\n$$\n\\beta(c) = (1-c)\\beta_{0}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $J(c)$:\n$$\nJ(c) = k \\frac{(1-c)\\beta_{0} I(t)}{N}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a short time horizon during which $I(t)$ and $N$ are considered constant. We can therefore consolidate all constant terms into a single positive constant $K$:\n$$\nK = k \\frac{\\beta_{0} I(t)}{N}\n$$\nThis simplifies the expression for the incidence rate to a linear function of $c$:\n$$\nJ(c) = K(1-c)\n$$\nThe baseline incidence, $J_{base}$, corresponds to the case with no intervention, where compliance $c=0$.\n$$\nJ_{base} = J(0) = K(1-0) = K\n$$\nThe objective is to find the minimum compliance level, $c^{\\ast}$, that achieves at least a one-half reduction in the instantaneous incidence relative to the baseline. This condition means the new incidence rate, $J(c^{\\ast})$, must be less than or equal to one-half of the baseline rate:\n$$\nJ(c^{\\ast}) \\le \\frac{1}{2} J_{base}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $J(c^{\\ast})$ and $J_{base}$:\n$$\nK(1-c^{\\ast}) \\le \\frac{1}{2} K\n$$\nAssuming transmission occurs, we must have $\\beta_0  0$ and $I(t)  0$, which implies that the combined constant $K$ is positive ($K  0$). We can therefore divide both sides of the inequality by $K$ without altering its direction:\n$$\n1-c^{\\ast} \\le \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nWe now solve for $c^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\le c^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\le c^{\\ast}\n$$\nThis inequality indicates that a compliance level of $\\frac{1}{2}$ or greater is required to achieve the desired reduction. The problem asks for the *minimum* compliance level, which is the lower bound of this range.\n$$\nc^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe problem requests the answer as a decimal.\n$$\nc^{\\ast} = 0.5\n$$\nThe given value for the baseline basic reproduction number, $R_0 = 1.6$, is extraneous to this particular calculation, which focuses on the instantaneous incidence under the specified short-term assumptions rather than on long-term epidemic dynamics or the threshold for epidemic control.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5}\n$$", "id": "4698586"}, {"introduction": "A critical challenge addressed by the Global Action Plan is the economic \"market failure\" that has stalled the development of new antibiotics.
