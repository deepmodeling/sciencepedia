Mutations to phage resistance occur during susceptible cell divisions with a per-division mutation probability $\\mu$, and resistant mutants, once formed, are unaffected by phage. An antivirulence agent that does not kill bacteria but slows their growth is administered prior to phage therapy; as a result, the net bacterial growth rate prior to phage therapy is reduced from a baseline of $1.0\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ to $r=0.70\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Probability of Resistance Emergence\n\nThe emergence of resistance is defined as the presence of at least one resistant bacterium. It is simpler to calculate the probability of the complementary event: no resistant bacteria emerging. Let this probability be $P(\\text{no res})$. The probability of resistance emergence, $P(\\text{res})$, is then $1 - P(\\text{no res})$.\n\nAccording to the Luria–Delbrück framework, the probability of zero mutation events is given by $P(0) = \\exp(-\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean number of mutation events. The total mean number of mutations, $\\lambda_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the mean mutations occurring during the pre-therapy growth phase ($\\lambda_{\\text{pre}}$) and the initial therapy phase ($\\lambda_{\\text{post}}$), as these are independent processes.\n$$P(\\text{no res}) = \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{total}}) = \\exp(-(\\lambda_{\\text{pre}} + \\lambda_{\\text{post}}))$$\n\n**1. Mutations during Pre-Therapy Growth (t < 0):**\nThe susceptible population grows exponentially from an initial size $N_i$ to $S_0$ at $t=0$, governed by $\\frac{dS}{dt} = rS$. The rate of cell divisions per unit time is $rS(t)$. The total number of divisions, $N_{\\text{div,pre}}$, over this growth period is the integral of the division rate over time. A simpler approach is to note that for every net increase in population size, one division must have occurred. Thus, the total number of new cells (and hence divisions) is the final population minus the initial population.\n$$N_{\\text{div,pre}} = S_0 - N_i$$\nThe mean number of mutation events in this phase is:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{pre}} = \\mu \\times N_{\\text{div,pre}} = \\mu (S_0 - N_i)$$\n\n**2. Mutations during Initial Therapy Phase (t ≥ 0):**\nAt $t=0$, phage therapy begins. The susceptible population dynamics is now $\\frac{dS}{dt} = (r-k_0)S$. For elimination to occur, phage pressure must be \"sufficiently strong,\" meaning the net rate of change is negative, i.e., $k_0 > r$. Let $\\delta = k_0 - r > 0$ be the net clearance rate.\nThe population size over time is $S(t) = S_0 \\exp(-\\delta t)$.\nDuring this phase, cells are being cleared, but they are also still attempting to divide at a per-capita rate $r$. The rate of cell divisions is $rS(t)$. The total number of divisions during the entire elimination phase ($t \\in [0, \\infty)$) is:\n$$N_{\\text{div,post}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} rS(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} rS_0 \\exp(-(k_0-r)t) dt$$\n$$N_{\\text{div,post}} = rS_0 \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-(k_0-r)t)}{-(k_0-r)} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = rS_0 \\left( 0 - \\frac{1}{-(k_0-r)} \\right) = \\frac{rS_0}{k_0-r}$$\nThe mean number of mutation events in this phase is:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{post}} = \\mu \\times N_{\\text{div,post}} = \\mu \\frac{rS_0}{k_0-r}$$\nThe phage killing rate $k_0$ is given by $k_0 = \\phi C_{P0} = \\phi(P_0/V)$. Substituting $P_0 = RS_0$, we get:\n$$k_0 = \\frac{\\phi R S_0}{V}$$\n\n**3. Analytic Expression for $P(\\text{res})$:**\nCombining the terms, the total mean number of mutations is:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{total}} = \\mu (S_0 - N_i) + \\mu \\frac{rS_0}{k_0-r} = \\mu \\left( (S_0 - N_i) + \\frac{rS_0}{\\frac{\\phi R S_0}{V} - r} \\right)$$\nThe probability of no resistance is $P(\\text{no res}) = \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{total}})$.\nTherefore, the probability of resistance emergence is:\n$$P(\\text{res}) = 1 - P(\\text{no res}) = 1 - \\exp\\left[-\\mu \\left( (S_0 - N_i) + \\frac{rS_0}{\\frac{\\phi R S_0}{V} - r} \\right)\\right]$$\nThis is the required analytic expression.\n\n### Calculation of the Minimum Phage-to-Bacteria Ratio R\n\nWe are tasked to find the minimum value of $R$ such that the probability of resistance emergence is strictly below $0.05$.\n$$P(\\text{res})  0.05$$\n$$1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{total}})  0.05$$\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{total}}) > 0.95$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\lambda_{\\text{total}} > \\ln(0.95)$$\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{total}}  -\\ln(0.95)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$\\mu \\left( (S_0 - N_i) + \\frac{rS_0}{\\frac{\\phi R S_0}{V} - r} \\right)  -\\ln(0.95)$$\nLet's solve for $R$.\n$$(S_0 - N_i) + \\frac{rS_0}{\\frac{\\phi R S_0}{V} - r}  \\frac{-\\ln(0.95)}{\\mu}$$\n$$\\frac{rS_0}{\\frac{\\phi R S_0}{V} - r}  \\frac{-\\ln(0.95)}{\\mu} - (S_0 - N_i)$$\nLet $X = \\frac{-\\ln(0.95)}{\\mu} - (S_0 - N_i)$. The inequality is $\\frac{rS_0}{\\frac{\\phi R S_0}{V} - r}  X$.\nFor this to hold, the denominator on the left must be positive and sufficiently large.\n$$\\frac{\\phi R S_0}{V} - r > \\frac{rS_0}{X}$$\n$$\\frac{\\phi R S_0}{V} > r + \\frac{rS_0}{X}$$\n$$R > \\frac{V}{\\phi S_0} \\left( r + \\frac{rS_0}{X} \\right)$$\n$$R > \\frac{V}{\\phi S_0} \\left( r + \\frac{rS_0}{\\frac{-\\ln(0.95)}{\\mu} - (S_0 - N_i)} \\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}$\n- $S_0 = 2.0 \\times 10^6$\n- $N_i = 1.0 \\times 10^3$\n- $r = 0.70 \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- $\\phi = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{PFU}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- $V = 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$\n\nFirst, calculate the term in the denominator of the nested fraction:\n$$\\frac{-\\ln(0.95)}{\\mu} = \\frac{-(-0.05129329...)}{1.0 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx 5.12933 \\times 10^6$$\n$$S_0 - N_i = 2.0 \\times 10^6 - 1.0 \\times 10^3 = 1.999 \\times 10^6$$\nSo, $X = 5.12933 \\times 10^6 - 1.999 \\times 10^6 = 3.13033 \\times 10^6$.\n\nNow calculate the terms in the parenthesis:\n$$r + \\frac{rS_0}{X} = 0.70 + \\frac{0.70 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^6)}{3.13033 \\times 10^6} \\approx 0.70 + 0.44723 = 1.14723 \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\n\nFinally, calculate the pre-factor:\n$$\\frac{V}{\\phi S_0} = \\frac{1.0 \\, \\mathrm{mL}}{(2.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{PFU}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^6 \\text{ cells})} = \\frac{1.0}{4.0 \\times 10^{-3}} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{PFU} \\cdot \\mathrm{h}}{\\text{cell}} = 250 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{PFU} \\cdot \\mathrm{h}}{\\text{cell}}$$\n\nCombining these results to find the lower bound for $R$:\n$$R > 250 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{PFU} \\cdot \\mathrm{h}}{\\text{cell}} \\times 1.14723 \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\approx 286.808 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{PFU}}{\\text{cell}}$$\n\nThe value of $R$ must be strictly greater than $286.808$.

The phage adsorbs to susceptible bacteria with a mass-action rate constant $\\phi$ (per unit time per unit biomass), has a natural decay rate $\\delta$ (per unit time), and is also removed by chemostat outflow at rate $m$ (per unit time). The phage life cycle produces a burst of $\\beta$ new virions per successful infection after a latent period that can be neglected for threshold analysis. An antivirulence intervention reduces host resource availability to the phage, which multiplicatively reduces the burst size to $\\beta(1-\\alpha)$, where $0 \\leq \\alpha  1$ is the antivirulence efficacy parameter.\n\nLet the refuge fraction be $f$, so that the susceptible biomass is $S = (1-f) B_{\\text{tot}}$. Using mass-action infection and a birth–death approximation for phage dynamics at low phage density, derive from first principles the minimal refuge fraction $f^{\\star}$ required to make the net per capita phage growth rate non-positive, thereby preventing phage-driven collapse of total bacterial biomass. Express $f^{\\star}$ in closed form as a function of $\\phi$, $\\beta$, $\\alpha$, $\\delta$, $m$, and $B_{\\text{tot}}$. Assume parameter values satisfy $\\phi B_{\\text{tot}} [\\beta(1-\\alpha) - 1]  \\delta + m$ so that phage would expand in the absence of a refuge (i.e., when $f = 0$), and that the derived $f^{\\star}$ lies strictly between $0$ and $1$. Provide your final answer as a single analytic expression. No units are required in the final expression, which should be a dimensionless fraction.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the minimal refuge fraction, $f^{\\star}$, that prevents the expansion of a lytic bacteriophage population in a chemostat. This is a threshold problem that can be solved by analyzing the net per capita growth rate of the phage population at low density. The phage population will be prevented from expanding if its net per capita growth rate is non-positive.\n\nLet $P$ denote the concentration or total number of free phage particles. The dynamics of the phage population are governed by a birth-death process. The rate of change of the phage population, $\\frac{dP}{dt}$, can be expressed as the difference between the rate of phage production (births) and the rate of phage removal (deaths).\n\nThe production of new phages occurs through the infection of susceptible bacteria. According to the problem statement, this process follows mass-action kinetics.\nThe rate of infection events is proportional to the product of the susceptible bacterial biomass, $S$, and the phage population size, $P$, with a rate constant $\\phi$. Thus, the rate of infections is $\\phi S P$.\nUpon successful infection, each bacterium lyses and releases a burst of new virions. The problem specifies that an antivirulence intervention reduces the burst size $\\beta$ to an effective burst size of $\\beta(1-\\alpha)$, where $\\alpha$ is the antivirulence efficacy.\nTherefore, the total rate of phage production is given by:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Production} = \\beta(1-\\alpha) \\phi S P $$\nIt is noted that the latent period is negligible, so production is effectively instantaneous upon infection.\n\nThe removal of phages from the free-virion population occurs through three distinct processes:\n1.  Adsorption to susceptible hosts: The act of infection itself removes a phage from the free population. The rate of this process is the same as the infection rate, $\\phi S P$.\n2.  Natural decay: Phages have a finite lifespan and decay at a constant per capita rate $\\delta$. The total rate of decay is $\\delta P$.\n3.  Chemostat outflow: The continuous flow of the chemostat washes out phages at a per capita rate $m$. The total rate of outflow is $m P$.\n\nSumming these terms gives the total rate of phage removal:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Removal} = \\phi S P + \\delta P + m P = (\\phi S + \\delta + m) P $$\n\nCombining the production and removal rates, we can write the first-principles differential equation for the phage population dynamics:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Production}) - (\\text{Rate of Removal}) $$\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = \\beta(1-\\alpha) \\phi S P - (\\phi S + \\delta + m) P $$\nThis equation can be simplified by factoring out the common term $P$:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = \\left[ \\beta(1-\\alpha) \\phi S - \\phi S - \\delta - m \\right] P $$\nFurther simplification by factoring out $\\phi S$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = \\left[ \\phi S (\\beta(1-\\alpha) - 1) - (\\delta + m) \\right] P $$\nThe term in the square brackets is the net per capita growth rate of the phage population, which we denote as $r_P$:\n$$ r_P = \\frac{1}{P}\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\phi S (\\beta(1-\\alpha) - 1) - (\\delta + m) $$\nThe condition for preventing phage population expansion is that this net per capita growth rate must be non-positive, i.e., $r_P \\le 0$. The minimal refuge fraction $f^{\\star}$ corresponds to the threshold case where the growth rate is exactly zero, as any larger fraction would make the growth rate negative. Setting $r_P = 0$:\n$$ \\phi S (\\beta(1-\\alpha) - 1) - (\\delta + m) = 0 $$\nThe problem states that the susceptible biomass, $S$, is a fraction $(1-f)$ of the constant total biomass, $B_{\\text{tot}}$. Thus, $S = (1-f) B_{\\text{tot}}$. We substitute this expression into the threshold equation. The minimal refuge fraction is denoted as $f^{\\star}$.\n$$ \\phi (1-f^{\\star}) B_{\\text{tot}} (\\beta(1-\\alpha) - 1) - (\\delta + m) = 0 $$\nWe now solve this equation for $f^{\\star}$.\nFirst, move the loss terms to the right-hand side:\n$$ \\phi (1-f^{\\star}) B_{\\text{tot}} (\\beta(1-\\alpha) - 1) = \\delta + m $$\nNext, isolate the term $(1-f^{\\star})$:\n$$ 1-f^{\\star} = \\frac{\\delta + m}{\\phi B_{\\text{tot}} (\\beta(1-\\alpha) - 1)} $$\nFinally, solve for $f^{\\star}$:\n$$ f^{\\star} = 1 - \\frac{\\delta + m}{\\phi B_{\\text{tot}} (\\beta(1-\\alpha) - 1)} $$\nThis expression gives the minimal refuge fraction required to halt the growth of the phage population. The problem provides an assumption, $\\phi B_{\\text{tot}} [\\beta(1-\\alpha) - 1]  \\delta + m$, which ensures that the denominator is positive and greater than the numerator, guaranteeing that $0  f^{\\star}  1$. This is consistent with a physically meaningful refuge fraction.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1 - \\frac{\\delta + m}{\\phi B_{\\text{tot}} (\\beta(1-\\alpha) - 1)}} $$", "id": "4678387"}]}
