## Introduction
Studying infectious diseases presents a profound challenge: how can we accurately model the complex interplay between a pathogen and its human host? Traditional two-dimensional cell cultures lack physiological relevance, while animal models often fail to recapitulate key aspects of human pathophysiology. This gap between simplified laboratory systems and the reality of human disease has created a bottleneck in our ability to understand pathogenesis and develop effective therapies. To bridge this divide, a new paradigm is emerging, built on the strategic integration of three transformative technologies: [organoids](@entry_id:153002), [single-cell genomics](@entry_id:274871), and [human challenge models](@entry_id:180175). Together, these platforms create a powerful research continuum, enabling an iterative cycle of discovery that flows from mechanistic investigation in a dish to causal validation in humans.

This article provides a comprehensive guide to this integrated approach. In the first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, we will explore the fundamental concepts behind each platform. You will learn how organoids self-organize to mimic human tissues, how [single-cell sequencing](@entry_id:198847) deconstructs this complexity at unparalleled resolution, and how human challenge studies are designed and conducted to provide the ultimate ground truth. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, will demonstrate how these tools are applied in concert to dissect pathogenesis, test antiviral therapies, and model [disease dynamics](@entry_id:166928) from the cell to the population. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will offer practical problems to solidify your quantitative understanding of the data generated by these powerful methods. By the end, you will have a robust conceptual framework for leveraging this synergistic toolkit to accelerate the fight against infectious diseases.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The previous chapter introduced the rationale for integrating advanced experimental models in infectious disease research. Here, we delve into the fundamental principles and mechanisms that govern these platforms: [organoids](@entry_id:153002), [single-cell genomics](@entry_id:274871), and human challenge studies. We will explore how tissues self-organize in a dish, how we deconstruct their complexity at single-cell resolution, and how we ethically and rigorously validate these findings in humans. Our goal is to build a conceptual toolkit for designing, executing, and interpreting studies that bridge the gap from in vitro mechanism to in vivo human pathophysiology.

### Modeling Tissues In Vitro: A Taxonomy of 3D Systems

The limitations of two-dimensional cell culture and the ethical and practical constraints of animal models have spurred the development of three-dimensional (3D) in vitro systems that better recapitulate human tissue architecture and function. These models exist on a spectrum of complexity and biological fidelity. To select the appropriate model, it is crucial to understand their defining characteristics.

Simple 3D systems include **spheroids**, which are typically aggregates of a single cell line (e.g., a cancer cell line) grown in non-adherent conditions. While they offer a 3D context that can enhance cell viability and function compared to monolayers, they lack the cellular diversity and [microarchitecture](@entry_id:751960) of a native organ. Another important model is the tissue **explant**, a small piece of tissue excised from an organism and maintained in short-term culture. Explants offer the highest initial fidelity, preserving the native cellular composition and architecture, but they are not generated de novo in vitro and have limited viability and expandability.

More sophisticated systems include **organs-on-chips**, which are microfluidic devices engineered to recreate specific functional units of an organ. These systems typically involve co-culturing multiple cell types on an artificial scaffold, often with integrated perfusion and mechanical forces (e.g., stretch or fluid shear). The architecture in an [organ-on-a-chip](@entry_id:274620) is externally imposed by the device's design, rather than emerging from intrinsic biological processes.

At the apex of this hierarchy lies the **organoid**, a model system defined by a unique set of properties derived from developmental biology. A rigorous definition distinguishes organoids by their fulfillment of several key criteria [@problem_id:4676483]:

-   **Self-Organization ($S$):** An [organoid](@entry_id:163459) arises from the process of **emergent morphogenesis**. Starting from a minimally patterned culture of stem or progenitor cells, it spontaneously forms complex, tissue-like structures through intrinsic cell-cell and [cell-matrix interactions](@entry_id:274209), recapitulating aspects of in vivo development. This is distinct from the externally imposed architecture of an [organ-on-a-chip](@entry_id:274620).

-   **Cellular Complexity ($C$):** An [organoid](@entry_id:163459) must contain multiple, organ-appropriate cell types ($C \ge 2$) that arise through lineage diversification from the starting stem cell population. For example, an intestinal [organoid](@entry_id:163459) will contain absorptive enterocytes, mucus-producing goblet cells, hormone-secreting enteroendocrine cells, and antimicrobial Paneth cells, all derived from a common intestinal stem cell.

-   **Functional Mimicry ($F$):** The structure must exhibit functions characteristic of the modeled organ. An intestinal [organoid](@entry_id:163459) should demonstrate polarized nutrient transport, and a lung organoid should exhibit [barrier function](@entry_id:168066) and [mucociliary clearance](@entry_id:192207). The functions should emerge from the correct composition and architecture.

-   **Developmental Origin ($O$):** True organoids are derived from either [pluripotent stem cells](@entry_id:148389) (PSCs), such as embryonic or [induced pluripotent stem cells](@entry_id:264991), or from tissue-resident [adult stem cells](@entry_id:142438) (ASCs). This origin from a progenitor population is what enables the de novo morphogenesis.

-   **Microarchitecture ($M$):** The self-organization process results in a [microarchitecture](@entry_id:751960) that mimics the native tissue, including features like lumen formation, crypt-villus-like domains in the intestine, or budded structures in the lung. Critically, this architecture is an intrinsic outcome of the [self-organization](@entry_id:186805) process, not an external constraint.

Understanding these distinctions is paramount. An experimental question about [developmental patterning](@entry_id:197542) is best addressed with an [organoid](@entry_id:163459), whereas a question about the effect of [fluid shear stress](@entry_id:172002) on endothelial cells might be better suited for an [organ-on-a-chip](@entry_id:274620).

### The Biophysics of Self-Organization: How Organoids Form

The capacity for [self-organization](@entry_id:186805) is the defining feature of an organoid. This remarkable process, where a disordered collection of cells spontaneously generates an ordered, functional tissue, is not magic; it is governed by a core set of biophysical and developmental principles. To engineer an [organoid](@entry_id:163459) that faithfully recapitulates an organ, one must provide a minimal set of ingredients that allow these principles to operate [@problem_id:4676545].

1.  **Cellular Diversity through Multistable Gene Networks:** To generate distinct cell types, the system must possess a mechanism for cells to adopt and maintain different fates. This is achieved through **cell-intrinsic [gene regulatory networks](@entry_id:150976)**. These networks are characterized by [nonlinear feedback](@entry_id:180335) loops that create **[multistability](@entry_id:180390)**—the capacity for the system to settle into one of several distinct, stable states of gene expression (attractors). A progenitor cell, upon receiving an external signal, can be pushed from an unstable state into one of these stable attractors, thereby committing to a specific lineage (e.g., enterocyte vs. goblet cell).

2.  **Positional Information through Morphogen Gradients:** For these diverse cell types to be arranged in a spatially organized manner, cells need to know their location within the developing tissue. This **[positional information](@entry_id:155141)** is typically provided by **morphogens**—diffusible signaling molecules that are produced in a localized source and form a concentration gradient across the tissue. Cells can "read" the local morphogen concentration and activate the appropriate fate-determining gene network. This process, often described by **reaction-diffusion** equations (e.g., $J = -D \Delta C / L$), allows for spontaneous symmetry breaking and the establishment of stable patterns from an initially homogeneous state.

3.  **Mechanical Stability and Morphogenesis through Physical Forces:** Genes and morphogens are not sufficient; the tissue must also take physical shape. This is governed by principles of **[soft matter physics](@entry_id:145473)** and **[mechanobiology](@entry_id:146250)**. Key forces include **[differential adhesion](@entry_id:276481)** between cell types, which drives [cell sorting](@entry_id:275467) and layer formation, and **active contractility** of the cellular cytoskeleton, which generates tension and drives changes in cell and tissue shape (e.g., the bending of an epithelial sheet). A stable structure, such as a hollow lumen, forms when these forces reach a [mechanical equilibrium](@entry_id:148830) that minimizes the system's total free energy. For example, a lumen can form if the apical (lumen-facing) surfaces of cells have a higher surface tension than their basolateral surfaces, making a hollow sphere an energetically favorable configuration.

These three axioms—multistable [gene networks](@entry_id:263400), [morphogen gradients](@entry_id:154137), and mechanical forces—constitute the minimal toolkit for [tissue self-organization](@entry_id:261293).

#### Epithelial Polarity: A Key Consequence of Self-Organization

A direct and critical outcome of self-organization in epithelial [organoids](@entry_id:153002) is the establishment of **[apical-basal polarity](@entry_id:148952)**. Epithelial cells partition their plasma membrane into an **apical domain**, which faces the external environment or a lumen, and a **basolateral domain**, which contacts the underlying basement membrane and neighboring cells. This polarization is maintained by **tight junctions**, [protein complexes](@entry_id:269238) that form a seal at the apical-lateral boundary, restricting the free diffusion of molecules between cells (the paracellular pathway) and between membrane domains.

The orientation of this polarity has profound experimental implications [@problem_id:4676541]. When grown embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM), [organoids](@entry_id:153002) typically form an **"apical-in"** configuration, where the apical surface faces an enclosed central lumen and the basolateral surface is exposed to the surrounding ECM and culture medium. Conversely, when grown in suspension without ECM, organoids can adopt an **"apical-out"** configuration. This orientation dictates how pathogens are introduced:
-   To infect an apical-in [organoid](@entry_id:163459) with a virus that uses an apical receptor (like influenza), one must deliver the inoculum to the lumen, typically via **microinjection**.
-   To infect the same [organoid](@entry_id:163459) with a bacterium that uses a basolateral receptor (e.g., Listeria monocytogenes binding E-cadherin), one can simply add the inoculum to the external culture medium (**bath application**).
-   Apical-out organoids conveniently expose the apical surface, allowing for easy bath application of apically tropic pathogens.

A third configuration, the **Transwell monolayer**, involves seeding [organoid](@entry_id:163459)-derived cells onto a permeable membrane, creating a 2D sheet that separates an upper (apical) and lower (basolateral) compartment. This system allows for precise, independent access to each domain and is the gold standard for quantifying [barrier function](@entry_id:168066).

#### Quantifying Emergent Function: Barrier Integrity

A primary function of many epithelia is to form a selective barrier. The integrity of this barrier, largely conferred by [tight junctions](@entry_id:143539), can be quantified. In Transwell systems, **Transepithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER)** is measured by passing a small current across the monolayer. Under Ohm's law, the resistance $R = \Delta V / I$ is inversely proportional to the ability of ions to flow through the [paracellular pathway](@entry_id:177091). A high TEER value (reported as area-normalized $R_{\mathrm{TEER}}$ in units of $\Omega \cdot \mathrm{cm}^{2}$) indicates a tight, well-formed barrier.

Alternatively, **paracellular flux assays** measure the passage of inert, fluorescently-labeled molecules (e.g., FITC-dextran) from the apical to the basolateral compartment. The flux $J$ is proportional to the permeability coefficient $P$, defined from Fick's law as $J = P \Delta C$. A low permeability indicates a tight barrier.

These macroscopic measurements can be linked to the microscopic state of the tight junctions using biophysical models [@problem_id:4676485]. If we assume transport is dominated by paracellular pores, both permeability and conductance are proportional to the open area fraction of the junctions, $\phi$. This fraction, in turn, can be modeled as dependent on the expression of sealing proteins like claudins. A simple binding-occupancy model might posit that the probability of a junctional pore being open is inversely related to the local protein expression $E_i$ of a cell, e.g., $p_i = K_d / (E_i + K_d)$. The macroscopic permeability would then be proportional to the average open probability across all cells:
$$ P \propto \mathbb{E}_{\mathrm{area}} \left[ \frac{1}{E_i + K_d} \right] $$
Similarly, TEER would be inversely proportional to this average:
$$ R_{\mathrm{TEER}} \propto \left( \mathbb{E}_{\mathrm{area}} \left[ \frac{1}{E_i + K_d} \right] \right)^{-1} $$
This model reveals a crucial insight: due to the nonlinear relationship, one cannot simply use the average protein expression ($\bar{E}$) to predict barrier function. By Jensen's inequality, $\mathbb{E}[1/(E+K_d)] \ge 1/(\mathbb{E}[E]+K_d)$. This means that [cellular heterogeneity](@entry_id:262569) in tight junction protein expression will result in a leakier barrier than would be predicted from the average expression level alone, highlighting the necessity of [single-cell analysis](@entry_id:274805).

### Engineering Organoids: Stem Cell Sources and Signaling

The properties of an [organoid](@entry_id:163459) are profoundly influenced by its cellular origin. The two primary sources are **[pluripotent stem cells](@entry_id:148389) (PSCs)**—including [embryonic stem cells](@entry_id:139110) (ESCs) and [induced pluripotent stem cells](@entry_id:264991) (iPSCs)—and **[adult stem cells](@entry_id:142438) (ASCs)**, which are tissue-resident multipotent progenitors (e.g., LGR5+ [intestinal stem cells](@entry_id:268270)).

-   **PSC-derived [organoids](@entry_id:153002)** are generated through a process of **[directed differentiation](@entry_id:204773)** that mimics [embryonic development](@entry_id:140647). They start from a pluripotent state and are guided through successive germ layer and organ field specifications. This developmental recapitulation means they have broader lineage potential and can generate complex tissues containing epithelial and mesenchymal components. However, this process is often incomplete, resulting in higher [cellular heterogeneity](@entry_id:262569), the presence of immature or off-target cell types, and greater variability between individual organoids. Pseudotime trajectories inferred from single-cell data of PSC-derived organoids are typically long and complex, reflecting the long developmental path from pluripotency [@problem_id:4676529].

-   **ASC-derived organoids** are generated from stem cells isolated directly from adult tissue. These cells are already committed to their respective [organ identity](@entry_id:192308). When placed in a suitable 3D culture environment, they self-organize to recreate their native niche and undergo homeostatic [self-renewal](@entry_id:156504) and differentiation. These [organoids](@entry_id:153002) are generally composed of a more restricted set of lineages (e.g., only the epithelium) and exhibit lower inter-[organoid](@entry_id:163459) variability, making them more reproducible for applications like drug screening. Their [pseudotime](@entry_id:262363) trajectories are shorter, representing the paths of normal tissue turnover [@problem_id:4676529, @problem_id:4676512].

The choice between PSC and ASC-derived [organoids](@entry_id:153002) depends on the research question. To study early development or congenital diseases, PSCs are essential. To model adult [tissue homeostasis](@entry_id:156191), disease, or drug response in a more reproducible manner, ASCs are often preferred.

Regardless of the source, organoid culture relies on the precise manipulation of key **signaling pathways** to guide cell fate. For [intestinal organoids](@entry_id:189834), these include [@problem_id:4676529]:
-   **Wnt/BMP Axis:** In the intestine, the crypt is the [stem cell niche](@entry_id:153620) and is characterized by high Wnt and low Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling. The villus is the site of differentiation and has the opposite profile: low Wnt and high BMP. In culture, we mimic the crypt by adding Wnt ligands (e.g., Wnt3a, R-spondin) and BMP inhibitors (e.g., Noggin) to maintain stemness. Removing Wnt and adding BMP drives differentiation into mature villus-like cells.
-   **Notch Signaling:** This pathway mediates **lateral inhibition**, a mechanism that diversifies cell fates among neighbors. In the gut epithelium, a cell stochastically destined to become a secretory cell will express a Notch ligand (like Delta), which activates Notch signaling in its neighbors. This Notch activation in the receiving cells *inhibits* them from adopting a secretory fate, forcing them into the default absorptive enterocyte lineage. Therefore, high Notch activity promotes the absorptive fate, while Notch inhibition (or low activity) is required for secretory fates (goblet, Paneth, enteroendocrine).

### Deconstructing Heterogeneity: Single-Cell RNA Sequencing

Organoids and tissues are not monolithic entities; they are complex ecosystems of heterogeneous cells. **Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)** is the revolutionary technology that allows us to deconstruct this complexity by profiling the transcriptome of thousands of individual cells simultaneously.

#### Principles of Droplet-Based scRNA-seq

A common scRNA-seq method is droplet-based partitioning [@problem_id:4676494]. In this approach, a suspension of single cells is co-encapsulated in microfluidic droplets with barcoded gel beads. The process is governed by Poisson statistics. To maximize the number of productive droplets—those containing exactly one cell and one bead—cells and beads are loaded at a low concentration (e.g., loading parameter $\lambda_c = \lambda_b = 0.05$). The probability of forming a valid singlet is $P_{\text{singlet}} = (\lambda_c e^{-\lambda_c}) (\lambda_b e^{-\lambda_b})$, which is typically less than $1\%$.

Inside the droplet, the cell is lysed, and its messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules are captured by primers on the bead. Each primer contains a **[cell barcode](@entry_id:171163)** (unique to the bead) and a **Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI)**—a short random sequence. The overall molecular capture efficiency is low, typically around $5-20\%$. A cell containing $T$ mRNA molecules will yield an expected $K = T \cdot p_{\text{cap}} \cdot p_{\text{RT}}$ distinct cDNA molecules for sequencing, where $p_{\text{cap}}$ and $p_{\text{RT}}$ are the capture and reverse transcription efficiencies.

After library preparation and sequencing, UMIs are critical for obtaining accurate digital gene counts. All reads that share the same [cell barcode](@entry_id:171163) and the same UMI and map to the same gene originated from a single initial mRNA molecule. By collapsing these reads into a single count, we correct for PCR amplification bias. The number of unique molecules detected per cell, $\mathbb{E}[U_{\text{cell}}]$, depends on both the [library complexity](@entry_id:200902) ($K$) and the sequencing depth ($r$), following the logic of an occupancy problem: $\mathbb{E}[U_{\text{cell}}] \approx K(1 - \exp(-r/K))$. At sufficient depth, the library approaches saturation, and $\mathbb{E}[U_{\text{cell}}]$ approaches $K$.

#### Dual Host-Pathogen Transcriptomics

Analyzing infected samples with scRNA-seq presents a unique computational challenge: reads can originate from either the host or the pathogen transcriptome [@problem_id:4676469]. A naive alignment strategy, such as mapping to the host genome first and then mapping the leftover reads to the pathogen genome, introduces a severe [reference bias](@entry_id:173084). A read with homology to both genomes might be incorrectly assigned to the host, even if its true origin is the pathogen.

The state-of-the-art method to avoid this is to align all reads against a **composite reference [transcriptome](@entry_id:274025)** that contains both host and pathogen sequences. This allows the aligner to evaluate the best possible alignment(s) in a species-agnostic manner. However, this often increases the number of reads that **multi-map** (align ambiguously to multiple locations). Simply discarding these reads leads to significant [information loss](@entry_id:271961). A superior approach is **probabilistic assignment**, where algorithms like the **Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm** use the alignment scores (as proxies for likelihood) to probabilistically distribute the contribution of each ambiguous read across its potential genes of origin. This "soft" assignment strategy generates the most probable and unbiased quantification. Finally, a rigorous analysis must also account for **ambient RNA**—background transcripts from lysed cells that contaminate droplets—which can cause uninfected cells to appear to contain viral reads.

### The Ground Truth: Human Challenge Models

While [organoids](@entry_id:153002) provide unparalleled mechanistic insight, their findings must ultimately be validated in humans. The **Human Challenge Model (HCM)**, or controlled human infection study, is a powerful paradigm for this purpose. In an HCM, healthy volunteers are intentionally exposed to a standardized dose of a pathogen under carefully controlled conditions.

#### The Ethical Framework for Human Challenge Studies

The intentional infection of healthy individuals carries significant ethical weight and is only permissible under a stringent set of conditions, guided by foundational bioethical principles like those in the Belmont Report and the Declaration of Helsinki [@problem_id:4676547]. Any proposed HCM must satisfy these jointly sufficient requirements:
1.  **High Social Value:** The study must address a critical public health question (e.g., accelerating [vaccine development](@entry_id:191769)) that cannot be answered by less risky means.
2.  **Scientific Validity:** The study must be rigorously designed to produce valuable, interpretable data. Exposing volunteers to risk in a flawed study is unethical.
3.  **Risk Minimization:** All possible measures must be taken to minimize risk. This includes selecting a low-risk population (e.g., young, healthy adults), using a carefully titrated inoculum dose, providing constant monitoring in a contained facility, and, crucially, having an effective **[rescue therapy](@entry_id:190955)** available to treat the infection if needed.
4.  **Favorable Risk-Benefit Balance:** The potential knowledge gained must clearly outweigh the residual risks to the participants.
5.  **Robust Informed Consent:** Participants must provide voluntary, uncoerced consent after a thorough process that ensures they comprehend all procedures, potential risks (including rare but severe outcomes and uncertainty), and benefits.
6.  **Fair Participant Selection:** Selection must be based on scientific and safety criteria, not on the vulnerability of a population. Compensation should not be so high as to be coercive.
7.  **Independent Review:** The study protocol must be reviewed and approved by multiple independent bodies, such as an Institutional Review Board (IRB), an Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), and a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).

#### Designing and Interpreting HCMs: Defining Endpoints

The success of an HCM depends on a well-defined hierarchy of endpoints [@problem_id:4676463].
-   **Primary Endpoints** are the most direct and clinically important measures used to answer the main study question. They must be objective and robust. For an acute respiratory virus, this might include **infection incidence** (defined by stringent criteria like two consecutive positive qPCR tests above the [limit of detection](@entry_id:182454)) and **disease severity** (measured by an integrated symptom score, e.g., Area Under the Curve, corroborated by objective physiological data like fever or oxygen desaturation).
-   **Secondary Endpoints** are supportive measures that provide additional context, such as **peak viral load**, duration of viral shedding, inflammatory biomarker levels (e.g., C-reactive protein), or the magnitude of the [adaptive immune response](@entry_id:193449) (e.g., neutralizing antibody titers).
-   **Exploratory Endpoints** are used for hypothesis generation and mechanistic discovery. This is the appropriate category for novel, high-dimensional readouts from organoids and scRNA-seq. For instance, an scRNA-seq-derived interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) module score might serve as an exploratory biomarker for early host response, or the infectivity of the challenge virus in a participant's own ex vivo organoids could be an exploratory correlate of their in vivo susceptibility.

### Bridging the Gap: Ensuring Validity and Reproducibility

The ultimate goal of this integrated research paradigm is to create a feedback loop where organoids inform human studies, and human studies validate [organoid](@entry_id:163459) findings. This requires a rigorous focus on both external validity and reproducibility.

#### External Validity: Translating Organoid Findings to Humans

**External validity** is the degree to which causal inferences from a model system can be generalized to a target population and context [@problem_id:4676512]. For organoid findings on viral infection to be credibly translated to the human airway, several criteria must be met. Using a simple model of infection probability, $P_i \approx 1 - \exp(-\int k_{\text{on}} [L(t)] R_i dt)$, we can identify the key parameters that must align:
-   **Susceptible Cell Population ($R_i$):** The [organoid](@entry_id:163459) and human tissue must have a comparable composition of susceptible cell types and a similar distribution of receptor expression levels on those cells. It is not enough for the mean receptor expression to match; the entire distribution matters due to the nonlinear nature of infection probability.
-   **Inoculum Dynamics ($[L(t)]$):** The temporal profile of pathogen exposure—the dose, route, and duration—must be comparable. A short, high-concentration bolus in vitro is biophysically different from a prolonged, low-concentration aerosol exposure in vivo.
-   **Microenvironment (modulators of $k_{\text{on}}$ and $[L(t)]$):** Critical microenvironmental factors present in vivo but absent in the [organoid](@entry_id:163459) must be accounted for. These include physical barriers and clearance mechanisms (e.g., mucus, airflow) that alter the effective local concentration of the pathogen, and the presence of resident immune cells that can modify the baseline susceptibility of the tissue.

#### Ensuring Rigor Across Platforms: Quality Control and Reproducibility

A cornerstone of translational science is **reproducibility**—the ability to obtain consistent results across repeated measurements. This requires a robust framework for quantitative Quality Control (QC) at every stage [@problem_id:4676520]. A dataset is only "analyzable" if it meets predefined acceptance criteria.
-   **General Metrics:** Reproducibility across replicates should be high, as quantified by an **Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)** $\ge 0.75$ or a Pearson correlation $r \ge 0.90$. Precision can be assessed by a **Coefficient of Variation (CV)** $\le 0.15$ for key readouts.
-   **Organoid Assay QC:** High-throughput screens should demonstrate good separation between [positive and negative controls](@entry_id:141398), quantified by a **Z-prime factor** $\ge 0.5$.
-   **scRNA-seq QC:** Data quality is assessed by metrics such as high numbers of UMIs ($\ge 10^4$) and genes ($\ge 2 \times 10^3$) per cell, low mitochondrial read fraction ($\le 0.20$), low estimated doublet rate ($\le 0.05$), and demonstrable mitigation of [batch effects](@entry_id:265859), as quantified by a metric like the **k-nearest neighbor Batch Effect Test (kBET)** [acceptance rate](@entry_id:636682) $\ge 0.70$.
-   **HCM QC:** The study's execution must be precise, with low CV for inoculum dosing (e.g., $\le 0.10$), high specificity of negative controls, high data completeness, and statistically sound evaluation of outcomes (e.g., ensuring the expected attack rate falls within the 95% confidence interval of the observed rate).

By adhering to these rigorous principles of design, execution, and analysis, the powerful synergy between [organoids](@entry_id:153002), [single-cell genomics](@entry_id:274871), and [human challenge models](@entry_id:180175) can be harnessed to accelerate our understanding and control of infectious diseases.
