Subsequently, this relationship must be used to calculate the value of $\\theta$ when $[L] = 9K_{D}$.\n\nFirst, we begin the validation process.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following definitions and conditions:\n- The reversible reaction at equilibrium: $M + L \\rightleftharpoons ML$.\n- The stoichiometry of binding is one-to-one ($1:1$).\n- The equilibrium dissociation constant is defined as $K_{D} \\equiv \\frac{[M][L]}{[ML]}$.\n- The total concentration of antibody binding sites is defined as $R_{T} \\equiv [M] + [ML]$.\n- The fractional occupancy is defined as $\\theta \\equiv \\frac{[ML]}{R_{T}}$.\n- The objective is to derive $\\theta = f([L], K_{D})$ and then evaluate $\\theta$ for the specific condition $[L] = 9K_{D}$.\n- The final numerical answer must be a decimal fraction rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it describes the standard model of monovalent ligand-receptor binding, governed by the law of mass action. This is a fundamental concept in pharmacology and biochemistry, often referred to as the Langmuir binding isotherm. The terms $K_D$, $R_T$, and $\\theta$ are defined in a standard, unambiguous manner. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and provides all necessary information to derive the requested relationship and perform the calculation. There are no contradictions, factual errors, or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The derivation and calculation will now proceed.\n\nThe goal is to express $\\theta$ solely in terms of $[L]$ and $K_{D}$. We start with the definition of fractional occupancy:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[ML]}{R_{T}} $$\nUsing the definition of the total concentration of antibody binding sites, $R_{T} = [M] + [ML]$, we can substitute this into the expression for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[ML]}{[M] + [ML]} $$\nTo eliminate the unknown concentrations $[M]$ and $[ML]$, we use the definition of the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_{D}$:\n$$ K_{D} = \\frac{[M][L]}{[ML]} $$\nFrom this equation, we can rearrange to express the concentration of free antibody binding sites, $[M]$, in terms of $[ML]$, $[L]$, and $K_{D}$:\n$$ [M] = \\frac{K_{D}[ML]}{[L]} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[M]$ back into our equation for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[ML]}{\\left(\\frac{K_{D}[ML]}{[L]}\\right) + [ML]} $$\nThe term $[ML]$ is a common factor in the denominator and also appears in the numerator. We can factor it out from the denominator:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[ML]}{[ML] \\left(\\frac{K_{D}}{[L]} + 1\\right)} $$\nAssuming the complex concentration $[ML]$ is non-zero (which is required for any binding to occur), we can cancel $[ML]$ from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{D}}{[L]} + 1} $$\nTo simplify this expression into a more conventional form, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[L]$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1 \\cdot [L]}{\\left(\\frac{K_{D}}{[L]} + 1\\right) \\cdot [L]} = \\frac{[L]}{K_{D} + [L]} $$\nThis gives the desired relationship for fractional occupancy as a function of free ligand concentration and the dissociation constant:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_{D}} $$\nThis is the well-known Hill-Langmuir equation for a system with a single class of independent binding sites (Hill coefficient of $1$).\n\nThe second part of the problem requires the evaluation of $\\theta$ for the specific case where the free ligand concentration is nine times the dissociation constant, i.e., $[L] = 9K_{D}$. We substitute this condition into our derived equation for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{9K_{D}}{9K_{D} + K_{D}} $$\nWe can factor $K_{D}$ from the denominator:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{9K_{D}}{K_{D}(9 + 1)} = \\frac{9K_{D}}{10K_{D}} $$\nSince $K_{D}$ is a non-zero constant, it cancels out from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{9}{10} $$\nThe numerical value is:\n$$ \\theta = 0.9 $$\nThe problem requires this value to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to $4$ significant figures. To express $0.9$ with four significant figures, we append trailing zeros:\n$$ \\theta = 0.9000 $$\nThis indicates that the precision of the value is known to four decimal places in this context.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9000}\n$$", "id": "4668994"}, {"introduction": "Moving from simple binding to a functional outcome, such as viral neutralization, often involves more complex biological rules than a simple one-to-one interaction.
