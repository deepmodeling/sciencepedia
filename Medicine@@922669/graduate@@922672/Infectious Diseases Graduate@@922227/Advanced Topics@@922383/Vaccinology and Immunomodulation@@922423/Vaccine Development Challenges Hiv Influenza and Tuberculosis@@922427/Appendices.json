This practice delves into the field of mathematical immunology, where systems of differential equations are used to model the dynamic interplay between a pathogen and the immune system. By constructing a simplified model of a *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* granuloma, you will explore how a vaccine's mechanistic effect—in this hypothetical case, enhancing IFN-$\\gamma$ production—can be simulated to predict its impact on controlling the bacterial load over time [@problem_id:4704277].", "problem": "A developer is asked to construct and analyze a minimal within-host dynamical model for Tuberculosis (TB) granuloma containment under vaccine-enhanced Interferon gamma (IFN-$\\gamma$) responses. The goal is to predict the effect of vaccine-boosted IFN-$\\gamma$ production on bacillary load trajectories and to compute an interpretable metric. The model must be derived from fundamental and well-tested principles of host-pathogen interactions, then implemented and integrated numerically.\n\nUse the following foundational base to derive the model:\n- Host-pathogen population dynamics: per-capita bacillary replication limited by resource constraints can be represented by a logistic term. If $B(t)$ denotes bacillary load in colony-forming units (CFU), then the intrinsic growth follows per-capita rate $r$ with carrying capacity $K$, implying a baseline net growth term consistent with logistic population dynamics.\n- Cytokine-modulated killing: the per-capita immune-mediated killing rate increases with IFN-$\\gamma$ concentration $I(t)$ and saturates at high $I(t)$. A standard saturating activation function from enzyme kinetics and receptor occupancy consistent with macrophage activation is a Hill function, for example $M(I) = \\dfrac{I^n}{I^n + \\theta^n}$, where $n$ is a Hill coefficient and $\\theta$ is a half-saturation parameter. The killing term is proportional to $M(I)$ and the bacillary load $B(t)$ with coefficient $k$.\n- Antigen-driven IFN-$\\gamma$ production and linear decay: IFN-$\\gamma$ is produced proportionally to antigen (bacillary) load with saturation due to limited T cell activation and antigen presentation. A common choice is $S(B) = \\dfrac{B}{B + h}$, where $h$ is a half-saturation constant. IFN-$\\gamma$ decays at a linear rate $\\delta_I$. A vaccine that enhances IFN-$\\gamma$ production scales the production rate by a factor $1 + \\eta$, where $\\eta$ is a decimal fraction (not a percentage).\n\nFrom these bases, derive coupled ordinary differential equations for $B(t)$ and $I(t)$ that capture:\n- Logistic bacillary growth with per-capita rate $r$ and carrying capacity $K$.\n- IFN-$\\gamma$-dependent killing proportional to $k M(I) B$.\n- IFN-$\\gamma$ production proportional to $S(B)$, scaled by a baseline rate $s$ and the vaccine effect factor $1 + \\eta$, and linear decay at rate $\\delta_I$.\n\nImplement the derived system and integrate from $t = 0$ to $t = T$ days. Use initial conditions $B(0) = B_0$ (in CFU) and $I(0) = I_0$ (arbitrary units, a.u.). The integration should yield $B(T)$ in CFU. Your program must produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets; the results for each test case must be a float equal to $B(T)$ in CFU, rounded to three significant figures.\n\nAngle units are not applicable. All physical units must be respected: $B(t)$ in CFU, $I(t)$ in arbitrary units (a.u.), and time $t$ in days.

The weights, $w_i$, for each stratum are the proportion of the total pooled population in that stratum.\nFirst, we find the total number of participants in each stratum, $N_i$:\n$$N_1 = N_{v1} + N_{u1} = 600 + 400 = 1000$$\n$$N_2 = N_{v2} + N_{u2} = 1800 + 1200 = 3000$$\n$$N_3 = N_{v3} + N_{u3} = 1600 + 800 = 2400$$\nThe total population across all strata, $N_{total}$, is:\n$$N_{total} = N_1 + N_2 + N_3 = 1000 + 3000 + 2400 = 6400$$\nThe standardization weights $w_i$ are then calculated as $w_i = N_i / N_{total}$:\n$$w_1 = \\frac{1000}{6400} = \\frac{10}{64} = \\frac{5}{32} = 0.15625$$\n$$w_2 = \\frac{3000}{6400} = \\frac{30}{64} = \\frac{15}{32} = 0.46875$$\n$$w_3 = \\frac{2400}{6400} = \\frac{24}{64} = \\frac{3}{8} = 0.375$$\nThe sum of the weights is $w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = \\frac{5}{32} + \\frac{15}{32} + \\frac{12}{32} = \\frac{32}{32} = 1$, as expected.\n\nThe standardized risk for a group $g$, denoted $R_g$, is the weighted average of its stratum-specific risks, where the weights are from the standard population:\n$$R_g = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i r_{gi}$$\nFor the vaccinated group, the standardized risk $R_v$ is:\n$$R_v = w_1 r_{v1} + w_2 r_{v2} + w_3 r_{v3} = (0.15625)(0.15) + (0.46875)(0.07) + (0.375)(0.06)$$\n$$R_v = 0.0234375 + 0.0328125 + 0.0225 = 0.07875$$\nFor the unvaccinated group, the standardized risk $R_u$ is:\n$$R_u = w_1 r_{u1} + w_2 r_{u2} + w_3 r_{u3} = (0.15625)(0.30) + (0.46875)(0.15) + (0.375)(0.15)$$\n$$R_u = 0.046875 + 0.0703125 + 0.05625 = 0.1734375$$\n\nVaccine efficacy ($VE$) is defined as the proportionate reduction in risk among the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated. When using standardized risks, this becomes the adjusted vaccine efficacy, $VE_{adj}$. It is calculated based on the adjusted risk ratio ($RR_{adj}$), which is the ratio of the standardized risks, $RR_{adj} = R_v / R_u$:\n$$VE_{adj} = 1 - RR_{adj} = 1 - \\frac{R_v}{R_u}$$\nThe derived expression for the adjusted vaccine efficacy, starting from the definitions, is:\n$$VE_{adj} = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i r_{vi}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i r_{ui}} = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\frac{N_{vi} + N_{ui}}{N_{total}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{C_{vi}}{N_{vi}} \\right)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\frac{N_{vi} + N_{ui}}{N_{total}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{C_{ui}}{N_{ui}} \\right)}$$\nThe $N_{total}$ term cancels, leading to:\n$$VE_{adj} = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} (N_{vi} + N_{ui}) \\frac{C_{vi}}{N_{vi}}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} (N_{vi} + N_{ui}) \\frac{C_{ui}}{N_{ui}}}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $VE_{adj}$ using the calculated standardized risks:\n$$VE_{adj} = 1 - \\frac{0.07875}{0.1734375}$$\nTo compute this precisely, we can use the fractional forms derived during the calculation of standardized risks:\n$R_v = \\frac{252}{3200} = \\frac{63}{800}$ and $R_u = \\frac{5.55}{32} = \\frac{555}{3200} = \\frac{111}{640}$.\n$$VE_{adj} = 1 - \\frac{63/800}{111/640} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{63}{800} \\cdot \\frac{640}{111}\\right) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{63}{111} \\cdot \\frac{640}{800}\\right) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{21 \\cdot 3}{37 \\cdot 3} \\cdot \\frac{4 \\cdot 160}{5 \\cdot 160}\\right) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{21}{37} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5}\\right)$$\n$$VE_{adj} = 1 - \\frac{84}{185} = \\frac{185 - 84}{185} = \\frac{101}{185}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$$VE_{adj} = \\frac{101}{185} \\approx 0.545945945...$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $5$, $4$, $5$, and $9$. The fifth significant figure is $4$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$VE_{adj} \\approx 0.5459$$\nThus, the adjusted vaccine efficacy, after controlling for confounding by baseline CD4 T-cell count, is approximately $0.5459$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5459}$$", "id": "4704294"}]}
