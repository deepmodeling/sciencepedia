This is described by the linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = -\\delta M(t)\n$$\nThis is a separable differential equation, which can be rearranged and integrated:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{M} dM = \\int -\\delta dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides yields:\n$$\n\\ln(M(t)) = -\\delta t + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.

The problem provides the initial condition $M(0)=D$. Substituting $t=0$ into the equation:\n$$\nM(0) = M_0 \\exp(-\\delta \\times 0) = M_0 \\exp(0) = M_0\n$$\nTherefore, $M_0 = D$. The explicit expression for the number of mRNA molecules per cell at time $t$ is:\n$$\nM(t) = D \\exp(-\\delta t)\n$$\nNext, the problem defines the instantaneous protein synthesis rate, $E(t)$, as being proportional to the instantaneous mRNA abundance, $M(t)$, with a constant of proportionality $\\alpha$, the translation efficiency.\n$$\nE(t) = \\alpha M(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $M(t)$ into this equation gives the explicit expression for $E(t)$ as a function of $D$, $\\delta$, and $t$:\n$$\nE(t) = \\alpha D \\exp(-\\delta t)\n$$\nThis is the first required result.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Cumulative Protein Production**\n\nThe total cumulative number of protein molecules produced per cell over the time interval $[0, T]$, which we denote as $P_{total}(T)$, is the definite integral of the synthesis rate $E(t)$ from $t=0$ to $t=T$.\n$$\nP_{total}(T) = \\int_{0}^{T} E(t) dt\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E(t)$ gives:\n$$\nP_{total}(T) = \\int_{0}^{T} \\alpha D \\exp(-\\delta t) dt\n$$\nSince $\\alpha$ and $D$ are constants with respect to time, they can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\nP_{total}(T) = \\alpha D \\int_{0}^{T} \\exp(-\\delta t) dt\n$$\nThe integral of the exponential function is $\\int \\exp(-\\delta t) dt = -\\frac{1}{\\delta} \\exp(-\\delta t)$.
