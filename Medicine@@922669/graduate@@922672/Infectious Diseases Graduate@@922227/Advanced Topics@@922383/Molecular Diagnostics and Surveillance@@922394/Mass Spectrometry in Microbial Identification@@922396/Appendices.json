It is free from contradictions, ambiguities, and scientific flaws. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid, and a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe core principle is the definition of mass error in ppm. For a mass spectrometer, the mass error is a measure of the difference between the experimentally measured mass and the theoretically calculated mass of an ion. Since the ions are specified as singly charged ($z=1$), the mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) is numerically equivalent to the mass ($m$) of the ion.\nLet $m_{obs}$ be the observed mass and $m_{theo}$ be the theoretical mass.\nFrom the problem statement:\n$m_{obs} = 4{,}562.345$\n$m_{theo} = 4{,}562.100$\n\nFirst, we calculate the absolute mass difference, denoted as $\\Delta m$. This is the absolute value of the difference between the observed mass and the theoretical mass.\n$$ \\Delta m = |m_{obs} - m_{theo}| $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\Delta m = |4{,}562.345 - 4{,}562.100| = 0.245 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the relative mass error. This is a dimensionless quantity obtained by dividing the absolute mass difference by the theoretical mass. This normalization allows for the comparison of mass accuracy across different mass ranges.\n$$ \\text{Relative Mass Error} = \\frac{\\Delta m}{m_{theo}} = \\frac{|m_{obs} - m_{theo}|}{m_{theo}} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\text{Relative Mass Error} = \\frac{0.245}{4{,}562.100} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the error to be expressed in parts per million (ppm).

A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe task is to compute two quantities: the resolving power $R$ at $m=4{,}000$ and a binary variable $B$ indicating whether the two specified peaks are baseline-resolved.\n\nFirst, we compute the resolving power $R$. The definition is provided as $R = \\frac{m}{\\Delta m}$.\nUsing the given values $m = 4{,}000$ and the instrument's FWHM $\\Delta m = 2$ in this mass range:\n$$\nR = \\frac{4{,}000}{2} = 2{,}000\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the value of $B$. This requires evaluating whether the two peaks at $m_{1} = 4{,}000$ and $m_{2} = 4{,}005$ are baseline-resolved. The criterion is that the intensity at the valley midpoint, $I_{\\text{valley}}$, must be less than $0.1$ times the maximum intensity of a single peak, $I_{0}$. The problem states to model the peaks with unit height, so we set $I_{0} = 1$. The condition for baseline resolution is therefore $I_{\\text{valley}} < 0.1$.\n\nThe total intensity profile, $I_{\\text{total}}(m')$, is the sum of two independent Gaussian peaks centered at $m_1$ and $m_2$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{total}}(m') = I_{1}(m') + I_{2}(m') = I_{0}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(m' - m_{1})^2}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) + I_{0}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(m' - m_{2})^2}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nWith $I_{0} = 1$, this becomes:\n$$\nI_{\\text{total}}(m') = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(m' - m_{1})^2}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(m' - m_{2})^2}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe valley is located at the midpoint between the two peaks, $m_{\\text{mid}} = \\frac{m_{1} + m_{2}}{2}$.\n$$\nm_{\\text{mid}} = \\frac{4{,}000 + 4{,}005}{2} = 4{,}002.5\n$$\nThe valley intensity $I_{\\text{valley}}$ is the total intensity evaluated at $m_{\\text{mid}}$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{valley}} = I_{\\text{total}}(m_{\\text{mid}}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(m_{\\text{mid}} - m_{1})^2}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(m_{\\text{mid}} - m_{2})^2}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe distance from the midpoint to the center of each peak is identical:\n$$\n|m_{\\text{mid}} - m_{1}| = |4{,}002.5 - 4{,}000| = 2.5\n$$\n$$\n|m_{\\text{mid}} - m_{2}| = |4{,}002.5 - 4{,}005| = |-2.5| = 2.5\n$$\nLet this distance be $x_{\\text{mid}} = 2.5$.

The condition for the peaks being resolved is $I_{\\text{valley}} < 0.1$, which is $2^{-5.25} < \\frac{1}{10}$.

The mass errors for Species B are significantly larger, ranging from approximately $3$ to $28\\,\\mathrm{Da}$.\n\n**2. Likelihood Calculation**\n\nFirst, we calculate the standard deviation $\\sigma_i$ for each observed peak $O_i$ using $\\sigma_i = \\frac{O_i/R}{2 \\sqrt{2 \\ln 2}}$. With $R = 20000$ and $2 \\sqrt{2 \\ln 2} \\approx 2.35482$:\n-   $\\sigma_1 = \\frac{4366.241}{20000 \\times 2.35482} \\approx 0.092708$\n-   $\\sigma_2 = \\frac{5408.405}{20000 \\times 2.35482} \\approx 0.114837$\n-   $\\sigma_3 = \\frac{6791.871}{20000 \\times 2.35482} \\approx 0.144212$\n-   $\\sigma_4 = \\frac{7345.103}{20000 \\times 2.35482} \\approx 0.155959$\n-   $\\sigma_5 = \\frac{8444.512}{20000 \\times 2.35482} \\approx 0.179304$\n\nThe likelihood ratio $\\frac{L_B}{L_A}$ is:\n$$\\frac{L_B}{L_A} = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{5} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon_{B,i}^2}{2\\sigma_i^2}\\right)}{\\prod_{i=1}^{5} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon_{A,i}^2}{2\\sigma_i^2}\\right)} = \\exp\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\frac{\\varepsilon_{A,i}^2 - \\varepsilon_{B,i}^2}{2\\sigma_i^2} \\right)$$\nLet $\\chi_S^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\frac{\\varepsilon_{S,i}^2}{2\\sigma_i^2}$. The ratio is $\\exp(\\chi_A^2 - \\chi_B^2)$.\n\nFor Species A:\n$\\chi_A^2 = \\frac{(-0.000276)^2}{2(0.092708)^2} + \\frac{(-0.000218)^2}{2(0.114837)^2} + \\frac{(-0.000158)^2}{2(0.144212)^2} + \\frac{(-0.000218)^2}{2(0.155959)^2} + \\frac{(-0.000276)^2}{2(0.179304)^2}$\n$\\chi_A^2 \\approx 4.430 \\times 10^{-6} + 1.802 \\times 10^{-6} + 0.600 \\times 10^{-6} + 0.976 \\times 10^{-6} + 1.184 \\times 10^{-6} \\approx 8.992 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\nFor Species B:\n$\\chi_B^2 = \\frac{(8.035724)^2}{2(0.092708)^2} + \\frac{(-2.979276)^2}{2(0.114837)^2} + \\frac{(23.447842)^2}{2(0.144212)^2} + \\frac{(7.024842)^2}{2(0.155959)^2} + \\frac{(-27.815276)^2}{2(0.179304)^2}$\n$\\chi_B^2 \\approx 3756.49 + 336.53 + 13217.93 + 1014.44 + 12032.47 \\approx 30357.86$\n\nThe likelihood ratio exponent is $\\chi_A^2 - \\chi_B^2 \\approx 8.992 \\times 10^{-6} - 30357.86 \\approx -30357.86$.\nSo, $\\frac{L_B}{L_A} = \\exp(-30357.86)$.\n\n**3. Posterior Probability Calculation**\n\nWe now compute the posterior probability for Species A:\n$$P(S_A|D) = \\frac{1}{1 + L_B/L_A} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-30357.86)}$$\nThe term $\\exp(-30357.86)$ is a number extraordinarily close to zero. For a very small positive value $x$, the expression $\\frac{1}{1+x}$ can be approximated by $1-x$.\n$$P(S_A|D) \\approx 1 - \\exp(-30357.86)$$\nThe value of $\\exp(-30357.86)$ is of the order $10^{-13185}$. This is computationally indistinguishable from $0$.\nTherefore, the posterior probability $P(S_A|D)$ is extremely close to $1$.\n\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $1.000$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.000}\n$$", "id": "4662233"}]}
