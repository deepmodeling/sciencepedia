To compare usage across different wards or time periods, raw consumption data must be normalized by patient volume.

The metrics \"days of therapy\" (DOT) and \"patient-days\" are standard, well-defined measures in the fields of infectious diseases, hospital epidemiology, and antimicrobial stewardship. The calculation of a normalized rate (e.g., per $1{,}000$ patient-days) is a fundamental and routine practice used to compare antimicrobial consumption across different institutions or time periods while adjusting for variations in patient volume. The provided numerical values are realistic for a large medical center over a three-month period.\n\nThe problem is well-posed and objective. It provides all necessary data and clear, unambiguous definitions for the terms used. The instructions are precise, leading to a unique and verifiable numerical solution. The problem does not contain any scientific falsehoods, contradictions, or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe core task is to compute a normalized rate. In epidemiology and public health, a rate is a measure of the frequency with which an event occurs in a defined population over a specified period of time. To allow for comparisons, a raw rate is often normalized by multiplying it by a standard factor, in this case $1{,}000$.\n\nThe raw rate of antipseudomonal beta-lactam use is the total days of therapy divided by the total patient-days. This represents the average number of DOT per single patient-day.\n\nLet $R_{raw}$ be the raw rate.\n$$ R_{raw} = \\frac{\\text{Total Days of Therapy}}{\\text{Total Patient-Days}} = \\frac{N_{DOT}}{N_{PD}} $$\n\nThe problem asks for this rate to be expressed per $1{,}000$ patient-days. Let this normalized rate be denoted by $R_{1000}$. To obtain this, we multiply the raw rate by the normalization factor of $1{,}000$.\n\n$$ R_{1000} = R_{raw} \\times 1000 = \\left( \\frac{N_{DOT}}{N_{PD}} \\right) \\times 1000 $$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $N_{DOT} = 3{,}400$\n- $N_{PD} = 25{,}000$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $R_{1000}$:\n$$ R_{1000} = \\left( \\frac{3400}{25000} \\right) \\times 1000 $$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$ R_{1000} = \\frac{3400 \\times 1000}{25000} = \\frac{3400000}{25000} = \\frac{3400}{25} $$\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $4$:\n$$ R_{1000} = \\frac{3400 \\times 4}{25 \\times 4} = \\frac{13600}{100} = 136 $$\n\nThe computed rate is exactly $136$ DOT per $1{,}000$ patient-days. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. The number $136$ consists of three digits ($1$, $3$, and $6$), all of which are significant. Therefore, the value $136$ is already expressed to $3$ significant figures, and no further rounding is necessary.\n\nAs required by the problem statement, a conceptual interpretation is now provided. The computed rate for the academic medical center is $136$ DOT per $1{,}000$ patient-days. This is compared to a peer benchmark of $150$ DOT per $1{,}000$ patient-days. The center's rate is lower than the benchmark. From an antimicrobial stewardship perspective, a lower rate of use for a specific class of antibiotics, particularly broad-spectrum agents like antipseudomonals, is often viewed as a positive indicator. It may suggest more judicious prescribing practices and successful stewardship interventions aimed at reducing unnecessary antibiotic exposure, which in turn can help mitigate the development of antimicrobial resistance and reduce side effects. However, this interpretation must be made with caution. The ultimate goal of antimicrobial therapy is to optimize patient outcomes. An unusually low rate of use could, in some circumstances, reflect under-treatment of infections, potentially leading to adverse clinical consequences. Therefore, while this institution's performance appears favorable relative to its peers, a comprehensive evaluation would require correlating this utilization data with clinical outcome metrics (e.g., mortality rates, length of stay, cure rates) and local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. The benchmark serves as a valuable external reference point, but the optimal rate for any institution is context-dependent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{136}$$", "id": "4624264"}, {"introduction": "Selecting an empiric antibiotic regimen involves a critical trade-off between ensuring adequate coverage for the likely pathogen and avoiding unnecessarily broad-spectrum agents. This decision can be guided by quantitative data derived from the local antibiogram, which summarizes pathogen prevalence and susceptibility patterns. This problem demonstrates how to apply the law of total probability to calculate the expected adequacy of different antibiotic choices, a core skill for developing evidence-based institutional treatment guidelines [@problem_id:4624180].", "problem": "A hospital intends to align empiric antibiotic choices for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) with Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) principles. The stewardship objective is to choose an empiric regimen that maximizes the probability of in-vitro coverage of the eventual causative pathogen on first dose while avoiding unnecessarily broad-spectrum therapy. The hospital antibiogram and case-mix for adult inpatient UTIs are summarized as follows: organism distribution is Escherichia coli at $0.68$, Klebsiella pneumoniae at $0.14$, Proteus mirabilis at $0.08$, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at $0.10$. Against these organisms, measured susceptibility proportions are: ceftriaxone has $0.75$ for Escherichia coli, $0.74$ for Klebsiella pneumoniae, $0.88$ for Proteus mirabilis, and $0.00$ for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; piperacillin-tazobactam has $0.92$ for Escherichia coli, $0.90$ for Klebsiella pneumoniae, $0.91$ for Proteus mirabilis, and $0.82$ for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Assume the organism identity and its susceptibility to a given drug are independent in the sense that the overall probability of coverage by a regimen equals the weighted sum over organisms of the organism’s prevalence multiplied by its susceptibility to that regimen. The hospital policy requires an empiric regimen to achieve an expected adequacy (coverage probability) of at least $0.85$ and to be as narrow in spectrum as possible subject to this threshold.\n\nUsing only the definitions above and scientifically standard probability rules, compute the expected adequacy of ceftriaxone and of piperacillin-tazobactam for this suspected UTI, determine which regimen should be selected under the AMS policy, and report the expected adequacy of the selected regimen. Express the final expected adequacy as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical microbiology and antimicrobial stewardship, well-posed with all necessary data and a clear objective, and free from internal contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe primary task is to calculate the expected adequacy of two empiric antibiotic regimens for urinary tract infection (UTI) and select one based on a defined antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) policy. The expected adequacy, or probability of coverage, is defined as the weighted sum of the susceptibilities of each potential pathogen, where the weights are the prevalences of those pathogens.\n\nLet $O_i$ denote the $i$-th organism. The prevalences, $P(O_i)$, are given as:\n$P(O_1) = P(\\text{Escherichia coli}) = 0.68$\n$P(O_2) = P(\\text{Klebsiella pneumoniae}) = 0.14$\n$P(O_3) = P(\\text{Proteus mirabilis}) = 0.08$\n$P(O_4) = P(\\text{Pseudomonas aeruginosa}) = 0.10$\n\nLet $D_1$ represent ceftriaxone and $D_2$ represent piperacillin-tazobactam. The susceptibility of organism $O_i$ to drug $D_j$ is given as a conditional probability, $S_{ij} = P(\\text{Susceptible}|O_i, D_j)$.\n\nThe expected adequacy of a drug regimen $D_j$, denoted $A_j$, is calculated using the law of total probability, as specified in the problem:\n$$A_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} P(\\text{Susceptible}|O_i, D_j) \\times P(O_i)$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the expected adequacy of ceftriaxone ($A_1$).

The provided susceptibilities are:\n$S_{12} = 0.92$ for E. coli\n$S_{22} = 0.90$ for K. pneumoniae\n$S_{32} = 0.91$ for P. mirabilis\n$S_{42} = 0.82$ for Ps. aeruginosa\n\nThe calculation for piperacillin-tazobactam is:\n$$A_2 = S_{12}P(O_1) + S_{22}P(O_2) + S_{32}P(O_3) + S_{42}P(O_4)$$\n$$A_2 = (0.92)(0.68) + (0.90)(0.14) + (0.91)(0.08) + (0.82)(0.10)$$\n$$A_2 = 0.6256 + 0.126 + 0.0728 + 0.082$$\n$$A_2 = 0.9064$$\n\nThe AMS policy has two components:\n1. The expected adequacy must be at least $0.85$.\n2. Subject to meeting the adequacy threshold, the narrowest spectrum agent should be chosen.\n\nWe apply this policy to our results:\n- For ceftriaxone, the expected adequacy is $A_1 = 0.6840$. This is less than the required threshold of $0.85$. Therefore, ceftriaxone is not an acceptable choice under this policy.\n- For piperacillin-tazobactam, the expected adequacy is $A_2 = 0.9064$. This is greater than the required threshold of $0.85$. Therefore, piperacillin-tazobactam is an acceptable choice.\n\nCeftriaxone is a narrower-spectrum agent than piperacillin-tazobactam, which has activity against Pseudomonas and a broader range of resistant organisms. The policy dictates choosing the narrowest agent that *meets the threshold*. Since ceftriaxone fails to meet the threshold, it is disqualified. Piperacillin-tazobactam is the only remaining option, and it satisfies the adequacy requirement. Thus, it must be the selected regimen.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected adequacy of the selected regimen, which is piperacillin-tazobactam. This value is $0.9064$.

This quantity is also known as the positive predictive value (PPV). The derivation will be based on first principles, as requested.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has a true infection with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.\nLet $D^c$ be the complement event, i.e., the patient does not have the infection.\nLet $T^{+}$ be the event that the PCR test result is positive.\nLet $T^{-}$ be the event that the PCR test result is negative.\n\nThe given information can be formally expressed as:\n-   Pretest probability (prevalence): $P(D) = 0.25$\n-   Sensitivity: $P(T^{+} \\mid D) = 0.90$\n-   Specificity: $P(T^{-} \\mid D^c) = 0.95$\n\nFrom the complement rule, the probability that a patient does not have the infection is:\n$$ P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 $$\n\nThe specificity gives the probability of a negative test in a non-diseased individual. We need the probability of a positive test in a non-diseased individual, which is the false positive rate. This is the complement of the specificity:\n$$ P(T^{+} \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(T^{-} \\mid D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\n\nThe post-test probability, $P(D \\mid T^{+})$, is defined by the formula for conditional probability:\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^{+})}{P(T^{+})} $$\n\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T^{+})$, is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. It can be expressed using the definition of conditional probability for sensitivity:\n$$ P(D \\cap T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\mid D) \\cdot P(D) $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^{+})$, is the overall probability of a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, by partitioning the event $T^{+}$ over the outcomes $D$ and $D^c$:\n$$ P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\cap D) + P(T^{+} \\cap D^c) $$\n$$ P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\mid D) \\cdot P(D) + P(T^{+} \\mid D^c) \\cdot P(D^c) $$\n\nCombining these expressions yields Bayes' theorem for this case:\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid D) \\cdot P(D)}{P(T^{+} \\mid D) \\cdot P(D) + P(T^{+} \\mid D^c) \\cdot P(D^c)} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula:\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{(0.90) \\cdot (0.25)}{(0.90) \\cdot (0.25) + (0.05) \\cdot (0.75)} $$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator (the probability of a true positive result in the population):\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = 0.90 \\times 0.25 = 0.225 $$\n\nNext, calculate the terms in the denominator:\n-   The probability of a true positive: $0.90 \\times 0.25 = 0.225$\n-   The probability of a false positive: $0.05 \\times 0.75 = 0.0375$\n\nThe total probability of a positive test is the sum of these two probabilities:\n$$ P(T^{+}) = 0.225 + 0.0375 = 0.2625 $$\n\nFinally, compute the post-test probability:\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{0.225}{0.2625} $$\n\nThis fraction can be simplified:\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{2250}{2625} = \\frac{90}{105} = \\frac{6}{7} $$\n\nConverting this exact fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$ \\frac{6}{7} \\approx 0.857142857... $$\n\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement, we get:\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}) \\approx 0.8571 $$\n\n### Antimicrobial Stewardship Justification\n\nThe problem asks for a justification regarding empiric anti-pseudomonal coverage based on antimicrobial stewardship principles. The institutional threshold for initiating such coverage is a posterior probability greater than $0.30$.\n\nThe calculated post-test probability of infection is $P(D \\mid T^{+}) \\approx 0.8571$.\nThe decision threshold is $0.30$.\n\nComparing the calculated probability to the threshold:\n$$ 0.8571 > 0.30 $$\n\nThe posterior probability of a *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infection, given the positive PCR result, is approximately $85.7_1\\%$. This value significantly exceeds the institutional decision threshold of $30\\%$.\n\nAntimicrobial stewardship aims to optimize antimicrobial use to improve patient outcomes while minimizing unintended consequences like toxicity and the emergence of resistance. In this case, the pretest probability was $0.25$, which is already substantial. The positive test result, with its high sensitivity and specificity, has refined this probability upward to $0.8571$. A probability of this magnitude indicates that the infection is highly likely. Withholding empiric anti-pseudomonal therapy in a critically ill ICU patient with suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia would pose a significant risk of increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, based on the high post-test probability that far surpasses the decision threshold, antimicrobial stewardship principles would strongly support the decision to initiate empiric anti-pseudomonal coverage. The benefit of treating a highly probable and serious infection outweighs the risks associated with antibiotic use in this context. The diagnostic test has provided a firm, evidence-based rationale for targeted therapy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8571}$$", "id": "4624219"}]}
