It is scientifically grounded in standard epidemiological principles for surveillance of healthcare-associated infections, is well-posed with all necessary information for a unique solution, and is stated using objective, precise terminology.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the incidence density of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). Incidence density, or incidence rate, is a measure of the rate at which new events occur over a specified period of population-time at risk. The general formula for incidence density ($IR$) is:\n$$IR = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases in a period}}{\\text{Total population-time at risk}}$$\nIn this specific problem, the 'new cases' are the observed CLABSIs, and the 'population-time at risk' is quantified by the total number of central line-days.\n\nThe givens extracted from the problem statement are:\nNumber of new CLABSIs, $I = 5$.\nTotal central line-days, $T = 2,500$.\nThe problem requires the rate to be expressed per $1,000$ device-days, which is a conventional scaling factor in infection prevention.\n\nThe CLABSI rate, denoted as $R_{CLABSI}$, is calculated by dividing the number of infections by the total central line-days and then multiplying by the scaling factor of $1,000$.\n$$R_{CLABSI} = \\left(\\frac{I}{T}\\right) \\times 1,000$$\nSubstituting the given values into this formula:\n$$R_{CLABSI} = \\left(\\frac{5}{2,500}\\right) \\times 1,000$$\nFirst, we calculate the raw rate (infections per line-day):\n$$\\frac{5}{2,500} = \\frac{1}{500} = 0.002$$\nNext, we scale this rate to be per $1,000$ line-days:\n$$R_{CLABSI} = 0.002 \\times 1,000 = 2$$\nThe calculated rate is exactly $2$ events per $1,000$ central line-days. The problem specifies that this result must be rounded to $3$ significant figures. To express the integer $2$ with three significant figures, we write it as $2.00$.\nTherefore, the observed rate is $R_{obs} = 2.00$ events per $1,000$ central line-days.\n\nThe second part of the task involves comparing this observed rate, $R_{obs}$, to two predefined thresholds:\n$1$. The median performance threshold, $\\theta_{m} = 1.0$ events per $1,000$ central line-days.\n$2$. The upper alert threshold, $\\theta_{u} = 2.0$ events per $1,000$ central line-days.\n\nFirst, we compare the observed rate with the median threshold:\n$$R_{obs} \\text{ vs. } \\theta_{m}$$\n$$2.00 \\text{ vs. } 1.0$$\nSince $2.00  1.0$, the observed CLABSI rate is **above** the median performance threshold.\n\nSecond, we compare the observed rate with the upper alert threshold:\n$$R_{obs} \\text{ vs. } \\theta_{u}$$\n$$2.00 \\text{ vs. } 2.0$$\nSince $2.00 = 2.0$, the observed CLABSI rate is **equal to** the upper alert threshold.\n\nThe question asks for the numerical value of the computed rate as the final answer, rounded to $3$ significant figures.

Using Bayes' rule:\n$$NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of obtaining a negative test result.
