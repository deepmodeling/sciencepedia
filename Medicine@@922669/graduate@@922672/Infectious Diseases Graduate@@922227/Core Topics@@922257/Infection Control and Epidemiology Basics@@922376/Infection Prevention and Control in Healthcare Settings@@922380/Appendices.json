The fundamental principle for microbial inactivation under constant conditions is that the rate of death is proportional to the number of viable organisms present at any given time, $t$. This is described by a first-order rate law.\n\nLet $N(t)$ be the number of viable spores at time $t$, and let $k$ be the specific death rate constant. The differential equation for first-order kinetics is:\n$$ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k N(t) $$\nTo find the number of survivors as a function of time, we solve this separable ordinary differential equation. We rearrange the equation to separate variables:\n$$ \\frac{dN(t)}{N(t)} = -k \\, dt $$\nWe integrate both sides. The integration is performed from time $t=0$, where the initial population is $N_0$, to a later time $t$, where the population is $N(t)$:\n$$ \\int_{N_0}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N} dN = \\int_0^t -k \\, d\\tau $$\nSolving the integrals gives:\n$$ [\\ln(N)]_{N_0}^{N(t)} = -k [\\tau]_0^t $$\n$$ \\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N_0) = -k(t - 0) $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we combine the terms on the left side:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = -kt $$\nThis equation relates the natural logarithm of the fractional survival to the exposure time. In sterilization science, it is conventional to work with base-10 logarithms. We convert from natural logarithm ($\\ln$) to common logarithm ($\\log_{10}$) using the change of base formula, $\\ln(x) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}(x)$:\n$$ \\ln(10) \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = -kt $$\n$$ \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = -\\frac{k}{\\ln(10)}t $$\nThe term on the left, $\\log_{10}(N(t)/N_0)$, represents the logarithmic reduction in the microbial population.\n\nNext, we incorporate the definition of the decimal reduction time, or D-value. The D-value is the time required to reduce the viable population by a factor of $10$. This means that when $t=D$, the survival fraction is $\\frac{N(D)}{N_0} = \\frac{1}{10} = 10^{-1}$. Substituting this definition into our base-10 logarithmic equation:\n$$ \\log_{10}\\left(10^{-1}\\right) = -\\frac{k}{\\ln(10)}D $$\n$$ -1 = -\\frac{k}{\\ln(10)}D $$\nThis allows us to express the rate constant in terms of the D-value:\n$$ \\frac{k}{\\ln(10)} = \\frac{1}{D} $$\nNow we substitute this expression back into the general inactivation equation:\n$$ \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = -\\frac{t}{D} $$\nThis is the fundamental working equation for first-order inactivation kinetics, directly linking the log reduction, processing time $t$, and the D-value.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the exposure time, $t$, needed to achieve a $6$-log reduction in the viable spore count. A $6$-log reduction means that the final population $N(t)$ is $10^{-6}$ times the initial population $N_0$. Therefore, the survival fraction is:\n$$ \\frac{N(t)}{N_0} = 10^{-6} $$\nThe logarithmic reduction is:\n$$ \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = \\log_{10}(10^{-6}) = -6 $$\nSubstituting this value into our working equation:\n$$ -6 = -\\frac{t}{D_{121}} $$\nWe can now solve for the required exposure time, $t$:\n$$ t = 6 \\times D_{121} $$\nThe problem provides the value $D_{121} = 1.83$ minutes. Substituting this value into the equation:\n$$ t = 6 \\times 1.83 \\, \\text{minutes} $$\n$$ t = 10.98 \\, \\text{minutes} $$\nThe integer $6$ is an exact number, so the number of significant figures in the result is determined by the given datum, $D_{121}$, which has three significant figures. The calculated value is $10.98$. The problem explicitly requests the result to be rounded to four significant figures. Since our calculation yields $10.98$, which already has four significant figures, no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe exposure time required to achieve a $6$-log reduction at $121\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is $10.98$ minutes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10.98}$$", "id": "4654665"}, {"introduction": "Effective infection control relies on accurate surveillance to identify and cohort colonized or infected patients.

Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\n\nThe PPV is defined as the probability that a patient is truly colonized with MRSA given a positive test result, i.e., $P(M \\mid T^+)$. We use Bayes's theorem to derive this:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(M \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid M) P(M)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result.

Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\n\nThe NPV is defined as the probability that a patient is truly not colonized with MRSA given a negative test result, i.e., $P(M^c \\mid T^-)$. Using Bayes's theorem:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = P(M^c \\mid T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- \\mid M^c) P(M^c)}{P(T^-)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test result.

Cohorting Accuracy (A)**\n\nThe cohorting accuracy is the probability that a patient is assigned to the correct cohort. A patient is correctly cohorted if they are MRSA-positive and test positive (a true positive), or if they are MRSA-negative and test negative (a true negative). These are mutually exclusive events. Let $A$ be the accuracy.\n$$ A = P(\\text{correct assignment}) = P((M \\cap T^+) \\cup (M^c \\cap T^-)) $$\nSince the events $(M \\cap T^+)$ and $(M^c \\cap T^-)$ are disjoint, the probability of their union is the sum of their probabilities:\n$$ A = P(M \\cap T^+) + P(M^c \\cap T^-) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(X \\cap Y) = P(X \\mid Y)P(Y)$, we can rewrite these terms:\n$$ P(M \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid M) P(M) = Se \\cdot p $$\n$$ P(M^c \\cap T^-) = P(T^- \\mid M^c) P(M^c) = Sp \\cdot (1 - p) $$\nTherefore, the analytic expression for cohorting accuracy is:\n$$ A = Se \\cdot p + Sp \\cdot (1 - p) $$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the values $Se = 0.83$, $Sp = 0.98$, and $p = 0.08$.\nFirst, let's compute the complementary probabilities:\n- $1 - p = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92$\n- $1 - Se = 1 - 0.83 = 0.17$\n- $1 - Sp = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$\n\nNow we substitute these values into the derived expressions.\n\nFor PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.83)(0.08)}{(0.83)(0.08) + (0.02)(0.92)} = \\frac{0.0664}{0.0664 + 0.0184} = \\frac{0.0664}{0.0848} \\approx 0.7830188... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\text{PPV} \\approx 0.7830$.\n\nFor NPV:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{(0.98)(0.92)}{(0.98)(0.92) + (0.17)(0.08)} = \\frac{0.9016}{0.9016 + 0.0136} = \\frac{0.9016}{0.9152} \\approx 0.98514... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\text{NPV} \\approx 0.9851$.\n\nFor Accuracy:\n$$ A = (0.83)(0.08) + (0.98)(0.92) = 0.0664 + 0.9016 = 0.968 $$\nExpressed to four significant figures, $A = 0.9680$.\nThe fact that the ward has $30$ beds is extraneous information not required for the calculation of these probabilities, which are properties of the test and the population prevalence.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0.7830 & 0.9851 & 0.9680 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4654686"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical protection offered by personal protective equipment (PPE) is often diminished by the realities of human behavior.
