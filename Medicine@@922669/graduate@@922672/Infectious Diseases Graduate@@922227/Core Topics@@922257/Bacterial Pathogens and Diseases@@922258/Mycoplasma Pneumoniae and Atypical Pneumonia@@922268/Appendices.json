Prior to testing, a clinician estimates the pretest probability of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection as $0.25$ based on epidemiology, clinical presentation (including dry cough and extrapulmonary findings), and seasonality. A nucleic acid amplification test using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for Mycoplasma pneumoniae returns a positive result. In the clinician’s practice setting, across similar patients, the positive likelihood ratio $LR^{+}$ for this PCR assay is $18$.\n\nStarting from Bayes’ theorem and the definition of likelihood ratios, use the odds formulation of evidence updating to derive the patient’s posttest probability of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection given the positive PCR.

Your final numeric answer should be only the computed posttest probability as instructed above.", "solution": "The objective is to compute the posttest probability of a *Mycoplasma pneumoniae* infection given a positive test result and to discuss this result in the context of clinical decision-making. The problem specifies using the odds formulation of Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has a *Mycoplasma pneumoniae* infection, and let $T^+$ be the event that the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test is positive.\n\nThe given information is:\nThe pretest probability of infection, $P(D) = 0.25$.\nThe positive likelihood ratio of the PCR test, $LR^{+} = 18$.\n\nThe problem requires starting from Bayes' theorem to derive the odds formulation. Bayes' theorem states the posterior probability $P(D|T^+)$ as:\n$$ P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\nSimilarly, the posterior probability of not having the disease given a positive test is:\n$$ P(D^c|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^+)} $$\nwhere $D^c$ is the complement of $D$.\n\nThe odds of an event $A$ are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring, $\\text{Odds}(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{1-P(A)}$.\nThe posttest odds of disease are the ratio of $P(D|T^+)$ to $P(D^c|T^+)$:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(D|T^+)}{P(D^c|T^+)} = \\frac{\\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}}{\\frac{P(T^+|D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^+)}} $$\nThe term $P(T^+)$ cancels, yielding:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D|T^+) = \\left(\\frac{P(T^+|D)}{P(T^+|D^c)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)}\\right) $$\nThe first term in the product is the definition of the positive likelihood ratio, $LR^{+} = \\frac{P(T^+|D)}{P(T^+|D^c)}$. The second term is the definition of the pretest odds, $\\text{Odds}(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)}$.\nThis yields the desired odds formulation for updating evidence:\n$$ \\text{Posttest Odds} = LR^{+} \\times \\text{Pretest Odds} $$\n\nNow, we apply this formula using the given values.\nFirst, we calculate the pretest odds from the pretest probability $P(D)=0.25$:\n$$ \\text{Pretest Odds} = \\frac{P(D)}{1-P(D)} = \\frac{0.25}{1-0.25} = \\frac{0.25}{0.75} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nNext, we calculate the posttest odds using the given $LR^{+} = 18$:\n$$ \\text{Posttest Odds} = LR^{+} \\times \\text{Pretest Odds} = 18 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 6 $$\nFinally, we convert the posttest odds back into a probability. The relationship between probability $P$ and odds is $P = \\frac{\\text{Odds}}{1+\\text{Odds}}$.\nThe posttest probability $P(D|T^+)$ is:\n$$ P(D|T^+) = \\frac{\\text{Posttest Odds}}{1+\\text{Posttest Odds}} = \\frac{6}{1+6} = \\frac{6}{7} $$\nTo express this as a decimal fraction rounded to $4$ significant figures:\n$$ P(D|T^+) = \\frac{6}{7} \\approx 0.857142857... \\approx 0.8571 $$\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a discussion on treatment decision thresholds.\nFrom first principles, a rational treatment threshold is the probability of disease, let's call it $P_t$, at which the expected utility of treating a patient is equal to the expected utility of not treating. A simplified but common model balances the expected harm of treating versus the expected harm of not treating. Let $B$ be the net benefit of treating a patient who has the disease, and let $H$ be the net harm of treating a patient who does not have the disease (i.e., harm from unnecessary treatment).\nAt the threshold probability $P_t$, the expected benefit of administering treatment must equal its expected harm.\nExpected benefit = $P_t \\times B$\nExpected harm = $(1-P_t) \\times H$\nSetting these equal defines the threshold:\n$$ P_t \\times B = (1-P_t) \\times H $$\n$$ P_t \\times B = H - P_t \\times H $$\n$$ P_t(B+H) = H $$\n$$ P_t = \\frac{H}{B+H} = \\frac{H/B}{1+H/B} $$\nThis equation shows that the treatment threshold is determined by the harm-to-benefit ratio, $\\frac{H}{B}$.\nIn the given scenario, the infection is *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*, for which there are \"clinically meaningful benefits\" to treatment (e.g., shorter duration of illness, prevention of complications). This implies a large value for $B$. Macrolide therapy has \"low-to-moderate treatment harms\" (e.g., side effects, cost, promotion of antibiotic resistance), which implies a relatively small value for $H$. Therefore, the harm-to-benefit ratio $\\frac{H}{B}$ is expected to be small. A small $\\frac{H}{B}$ ratio leads to a low treatment threshold $P_t$. For instance, if the harm of unnecessary antibiotics were considered $9$ times less significant than the benefit of treating pneumonia (i.e., $\\frac{H}{B} = \\frac{1}{9}$), the threshold would be $P_t = \\frac{1/9}{1+1/9} = 0.1$, or $10\\%$. More generally, for a condition like pneumonia, treatment thresholds are typically in the range of $0.1$ to $0.3$ ($10\\%$ to $30\\%$).\n\nOur computed posttest probability is $P(D|T^+) \\approx 0.8571$. Since $0.8571$ is substantially higher than any reasonable treatment threshold for this clinical situation (e.g., $0.8571 \\gg 0.3$), the positive PCR result provides a high degree of certainty. This would strongly support the clinical decision to initiate macrolide therapy.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.8571} $$", "id": "4671271"}, {"introduction": "Confirming a diagnosis is only the first step; ensuring the chosen therapy is effective is paramount.

Empirically, values near $10$ are associated with bacterial stasis, and values near $20$ are associated with approximately a $1$-log$_{10}$ reduction in bacterial burden in respiratory infection models.\n\nAssuming that free-drug concentrations in the ELF approximate the biophase concentration relevant for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, compute $f\\text{AUC}_{0-24}/\\text{MIC}$ from the given data, and then, drawing on the definitions above, discuss whether the exposure is likely to achieve the commonly cited pharmacodynamic target for clinical efficacy in atypical pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae.\n\nReport the ratio as an exact number (no rounding).

Subsequently, this calculated index must be interpreted in the context of empirically established efficacy targets for *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*.\n\nThe givens are explicitly stated as follows:\n1.  The free-drug area under the concentration–time curve in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) is $f\\text{AUC}_{0-24} = 5$ mg·h/L.\n2.  The minimum inhibitory concentration for the specific bacterial isolate is $\\text{MIC} = 0.25$ mg/L.\n\nThe pharmacodynamic index is the ratio $\\frac{f\\text{AUC}_{0-24}}{\\text{MIC}}$.

The physical interpretation of the value $20 \\text{ h}$ is the duration of time that the drug concentration would need to be held constant at the $\\text{MIC}$ value to achieve the same total exposure ($f\\text{AUC}_{0-24}$) observed in the patient. However, it is a well-established convention in pharmacology to treat the $f\\text{AUC}_{0-24}/\\text{MIC}$ ratio as a dimensionless quantity when comparing it to therapeutic targets, as the time interval ($24 \\text{ h}$) is a standardized component of its definition. The problem statement itself mandates that the final ratio be reported as a pure number, which we shall adhere to.\n\nThe calculated value of the ratio is precisely $20$.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires an interpretation of this result based on the provided empirical facts. The problem states that for macrolides against susceptible respiratory pathogens:\n- A ratio value near $10$ is associated with bacterial stasis (inhibition of growth).\n- A ratio value near $20$ is associated with approximately a $1$-log$_{10}$ reduction in bacterial burden (bactericidal activity).\n\nOur calculated value for the representative patient is $20$. This value aligns exactly with the second benchmark. Therefore, assuming that the free-drug concentration in the epithelial lining fluid is an appropriate surrogate for the drug concentration at the site of infection (the biophase), the azithromycin exposure in this patient is predicted to be sufficient to achieve a significant bactericidal effect against the infecting *Mycoplasma pneumoniae* isolate, corresponding to a $1$-log$_{10}$ (or $90\\%$) reduction in the bacterial population over the dosing interval.
