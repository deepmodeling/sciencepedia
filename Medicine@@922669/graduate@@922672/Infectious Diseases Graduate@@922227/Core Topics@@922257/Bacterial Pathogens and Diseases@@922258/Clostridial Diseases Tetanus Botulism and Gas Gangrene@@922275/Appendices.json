It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe inactivation of spores is stated to follow first-order kinetics. Let $N(t)$ be the number of viable spores at time $t$ and $N_0$ be the initial number. The rate of inactivation at a constant temperature $T$ is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = -k N\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the inactivation rate constant, which depends on temperature. Integrating this differential equation from $t=0$ to $t$ yields:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = -kt \\quad \\text{or} \\quad N(t) = N_0 \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThe D-value, denoted as $D_T$, is the time required at temperature $T$ for the spore population to be reduced by a factor of $10$, i.e., $N(D_T) = N_0/10$. Substituting this into the integrated rate law:\n$$\n\\frac{N_0}{10} = N_0 \\exp(-k D_T)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{10} = \\exp(-k D_T)\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right) = -k D_T \\implies -\\ln(10) = -k D_T\n$$\nThis gives the relationship between the D-value and the rate constant:\n$$\nD_T = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{k}\n$$\nNext, we derive the temperature dependence of the D-value using the definition of the z-value. The z-value, $z$, is the temperature change that causes a tenfold change in the D-value. Specifically, an increase in temperature by $z$ reduces the D-value by a factor of $10$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nD_{T+z} = \\frac{D_T}{10}\n$$\nTaking the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\log_{10}(D_{T+z}) = \\log_{10}(D_T) - 1\n$$\nThis relationship implies that a plot of $\\log_{10}(D_T)$ versus temperature $T$ is a straight line with a slope of $-1/z$. Using the point-slope form of a line with a reference point $(T_{ref}, D_{ref})$, we can write the equation:\n$$\n\\log_{10}(D_T) - \\log_{10}(D_{ref}) = -\\frac{1}{z}(T - T_{ref})\n$$\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{D_T}{D_{ref}}\\right) = -\\frac{T - T_{ref}}{z}\n$$\nSolving for $D_T$ by taking the antilogarithm (base $10$):\n$$\n\\frac{D_T}{D_{ref}} = 10^{-\\frac{T - T_{ref}}{z}}\n$$\nThis gives the general formula for the temperature dependence of the D-value:\n$$\nD_T = D_{ref} \\times 10^{\\frac{T_{ref} - T}{z}}\n$$\nThis expression fulfills the first task of the problem.\n\nNow, we compute the D-value at $T = 110^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$. The given reference values are $T_{ref} = 100^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$, $D_{ref} = D_{100} = 25$ minutes, and $z = 10^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$.\n$$\nD_{110} = D_{100} \\times 10^{\\frac{100 - 110}{10}} = 25 \\times 10^{\\frac{-10}{10}} = 25 \\times 10^{-1} = 2.5\\ \\text{minutes}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as required, the D-value at $110^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ is $2.50$ minutes.\n\nFinally, we infer the process lethality, which is the total holding time required to achieve a specified log reduction. A log reduction of $n$ means that the final population $N_f$ is related to the initial population $N_0$ by $N_f = N_0 \\times 10^{-n}$.\nFrom the first-order kinetics, we can express the number of survivors in terms of the D-value:\n$$\nN(t) = N_0 \\exp(-kt) = N_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(10)}{D_T}t\\right) = N_0 \\left(\\exp(\\ln(10))\\right)^{-\\frac{t}{D_T}} = N_0 \\times 10^{-\\frac{t}{D_T}}\n$$\nWe require a $12$-log reduction, so we set $n=12$. The required time, $t_{process}$, at $T = 110^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ must satisfy:\n$$\nN(t_{process}) = N_0 \\times 10^{-12}\n$$\nTherefore:\n$$\nN_0 \\times 10^{-\\frac{t_{process}}{D_{110}}} = N_0 \\times 10^{-12}\n$$\nEquating the exponents:\n$$\n-\\frac{t_{process}}{D_{110}} = -12\n$$\n$$\nt_{process} = 12 \\times D_{110}\n$$\nUsing the computed value $D_{110} = 2.5$ minutes:\n$$\nt_{process} = 12 \\times 2.5 = 30\\ \\text{minutes}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the required process lethality is $30.0$ minutes.\nThe two requested numerical results are the D-value at $110^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ and the total holding time for a $12$-log reduction.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2.50  30.0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4634138"}, {"introduction": "Antitoxin therapy is a critical intervention for toxigenic diseases like tetanus and botulism, but how does it work on a molecular level in the face of competition from the body's own cells?

The problem asks for a solution under the \"low-occupancy limit,\" which must be rigorously justified.
