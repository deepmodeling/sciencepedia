A blood sample for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is drawn at $t=2\\ \\mathrm{h}$. Consider the following widely accepted bases: PCR amplifies target deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) independent of organism viability; bactericidal antibiotics rapidly reduce viable colony forming units (CFU) but do not instantly eliminate genomic DNA, which is cleared or degraded over a finite time; and when sampling rare target molecules from a larger volume into a small reaction, the count of target molecules entering the reaction follows a distribution consistent with random sampling of independent events. Assume these experimentally supported parameters for Neisseria meningitidis in blood: initial total genome copies at $t=0$ are $10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{genome\\ copies/mL}$ and equal to the viable CFU per milliliter; the antibiotic kill rate for viable bacteria is approximately $1$ log$_{10}$ per hour (so viable CFU decline $10$-fold per hour); the half-life of free or cell-associated amplifiable genomic DNA in plasma is $t_{1/2}=3\\ \\mathrm{h}$ (first-order decay). The laboratory workflow for the meningococcal PCR assay is as follows: $1.0\\ \\mathrm{mL}$ of whole blood is extracted; the extraction recovery for amplifiable Neisseria meningitidis DNA is $50\\%$; the DNA is eluted in $100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{L}$; and $5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{L}$ of eluate is added to a single PCR reaction. Define the limit of detection (LOD) as the concentration in $\\mathrm{genome\\ copies/mL}$ that yields at least a $95\\%$ probability that a single PCR reaction contains at least one target genome.\n\nBased on these principles and parameters, which option best justifies why PCR remains sensitive even after antibiotic initiation and provides the most accurate estimate of the assay’s LOD under the stated workflow?\n\nA. PCR targets DNA and does not require viable cells; after $2\\ \\mathrm{h}$ of antibiotics, viability falls by about $10^{2}$-fold but amplifiable DNA declines only by a factor of approximately $2^{-2/3}\\approx 0.63$, so abundant target remains.

The problem statement will be validated prior to deriving the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe following data and principles are provided in the problem statement:\n- **Organism:** *Neisseria meningitidis*\n- **Clinical context:** Suspected meningococcal septicemia.\n- **Intervention:** Empiric intravenous antibiotics started at time $t=0$.\n- **Sampling:** Blood sample for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) drawn at $t=2\\ \\mathrm{h}$.\n- **Principle 1:** PCR amplifies target deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) independent of organism viability.\n- **Principle 2:** Bactericidal antibiotics reduce viable colony forming units (CFU), but genomic DNA is cleared or degraded over a finite time.\n- **Principle 3:** Sampling of rare target molecules from a larger volume into a small reaction follows a distribution consistent with random sampling of independent events (i.e., a Poisson distribution).\n- **Initial condition ($t=0$):** Total genome copies = $10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{genome\\ copies/mL}$; Viable CFU = $10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{CFU/mL}$.\n- **Antibiotic kill rate (viable bacteria):** $1$ log$_{10}$ per hour, which is a $10$-fold reduction per hour.\n- **DNA clearance kinetics:** First-order decay with a half-life of $t_{1/2}=3\\ \\mathrm{h}$.\n- **Laboratory workflow:**\n    - Input blood volume: $V_{blood} = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{mL}$.\n    - Extraction recovery efficiency: $\\eta_{ext} = 50\\% = 0.5$.\n    - Elution volume: $V_{eluate} = 100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{L}$.\n    - PCR template volume: $V_{template} = 5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{L}$.\n- **Definition of Limit of Detection (LOD):** The concentration in $\\mathrm{genome\\ copies/mL}$ that yields at least a $95\\%$ probability ($P \\ge 0.95$) that a single PCR reaction contains at least one target genome.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated for validity.\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The principles provided are fundamental to molecular diagnostics and infectious disease microbiology. The distinction between viability (measured by culture, CFU) and the presence of nucleic acids (measured by PCR) is a critical concept. The use of a first-order decay model for DNA clearance and a log-linear model for antibiotic killing are standard and valid approximations. The values given for bacterial load, DNA half-life, and antibiotic efficacy are plausible for the clinical scenario described.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear objective (evaluate the reasoning and calculate the LOD) and sufficient quantitative data to achieve it. All necessary parameters for the calculation are defined.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions or missing information. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. The solution will be derived by applying the given principles and parameters.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe solution requires two main parts: first, justifying why PCR remains sensitive after antibiotic administration, and second, calculating the assay's Limit of Detection (LOD).\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of DNA and Viable Bacteria Concentration at $t=2\\ \\mathrm{h}$**\n\nThe problem asks about the state of the sample taken at $t=2\\ \\mathrm{h}$. We must calculate the concentrations of both viable bacteria (CFU) and total amplifiable DNA at this time point.\n\n- **Viable Bacteria (CFU) Concentration:**\nThe initial concentration is $C_{CFU}(0) = 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{CFU/mL}$. The kill rate is $1$ log$_{10}$ per hour, meaning the concentration is multiplied by $10^{-1}$ each hour. After $t=2\\ \\mathrm{h}$, the concentration will be:\n$$C_{CFU}(2\\ \\mathrm{h}) = C_{CFU}(0) \\times 10^{-1\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\times 2\\ \\mathrm{h}} = 10^{4} \\times 10^{-2} = 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{CFU/mL}$$\nThus, the viable bacteria count has decreased by a factor of $10^{2}$ (or $100$-fold).\n\n- **Amplifiable DNA Concentration:**\nThe initial concentration is $C_{DNA}(0) = 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{genome\\ copies/mL}$. The DNA follows first-order decay with a half-life $t_{1/2} = 3\\ \\mathrm{h}$. The equation for first-order decay is:\n$$C_{DNA}(t) = C_{DNA}(0) \\cdot 2^{-t/t_{1/2}}$$\nAt $t=2\\ \\mathrm{h}$, the concentration is:\n$$C_{DNA}(2\\ \\mathrm{h}) = 10^{4} \\cdot 2^{-2/3}\\ \\mathrm{genome\\ copies/mL}$$\nThe factor of decline for DNA is $2^{-2/3}$. Let's approximate this value:\n$$2^{-2/3} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{4}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1.587} \\approx 0.63$$\nSo, $C_{DNA}(2\\ \\mathrm{h}) \\approx 10^{4} \\times 0.63 = 6300\\ \\mathrm{genome\\ copies/mL}$.\n\nComparing the two, after $2$ hours of treatment, the viable bacteria have dropped to $100\\ \\mathrm{CFU/mL}$, but the target for PCR, the genomic DNA, is still abundant at approximately $6300\\ \\mathrm{copies/mL}$. This directly explains why PCR remains a sensitive detection method even after antibiotic initiation.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Limit of Detection (LOD)**\n\nThe LOD is defined based on the probability of detecting at least one target genome in a single PCR reaction. This is a classic application of the Poisson distribution.\n\n- **Poisson Statistics for Detection:**\nLet $\\lambda$ be the average number of target genomes per PCR reaction. The number of genomes found in any given reaction, $k$, follows a Poisson distribution: $P(X=k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^k}{k!}$.\nThe probability of finding at least one genome is $P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0)$.\n$$P(X=0) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^0}{0!} = e^{-\\lambda}$$\nThe LOD requires $P(X \\ge 1) \\ge 0.95$.\n$$1 - e^{-\\lambda} \\ge 0.95 \\implies e^{-\\lambda} \\le 0.05$$\nSolving for $\\lambda$:\n$$-\\lambda \\le \\ln(0.05) \\implies \\lambda \\ge -\\ln(0.05) = \\ln(20)$$\n$$\\lambda \\ge 2.9957 \\approx 3.0$$\nSo, to achieve $95\\%$ detection probability, the PCR reaction must contain, on average, approximately $3$ genome copies.\n\n- **Relating $\\lambda$ to Blood Concentration:**\nNow, we must determine the blood concentration, $C_{LOD}$ (in copies/mL), that results in $\\lambda=3$ after the specified laboratory workflow.\n1.  **Initial Sample:** A volume $V_{blood} = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{mL}$ is taken from blood with concentration $C_{LOD}$.\n    Total genomes in sample = $C_{LOD} \\times 1.0\\ \\mathrm{mL}$.\n2.  **Extraction:** The recovery is $\\eta_{ext} = 0.5$.\n    Total genomes recovered = $C_{LOD} \\times 1.0 \\times 0.5$.\n3.  **Elution:** The recovered genomes are eluted in $V_{eluate} = 100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{L}$.\n4.  **PCR Aliquoting:** A volume $V_{template} = 5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{L}$ is taken from the eluate and added to the PCR.\nThe fraction of the eluate that goes into the PCR is $\\frac{V_{template}}{V_{eluate}} = \\frac{5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{L}}{100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{L}} = 0.05$.\n\nThe average number of genomes in the final PCR reaction, $\\lambda$, is the initial number of genomes from the blood sample multiplied by all the fractional losses/transfers:\n$$\\lambda = (C_{LOD} \\times V_{blood}) \\times \\eta_{ext} \\times \\frac{V_{template}}{V_{eluate}}$$\nLet's define a processing factor, $F$, that relates the initial concentration in copies/mL to the average number of copies in the final reaction. Here, $V_{blood}$ is $1.0\\ \\mathrm{mL}$, so the factor is a volume in mL.\n$$F = V_{blood} \\times \\eta_{ext} \\times \\frac{V_{template}}{V_{eluate}} = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{mL} \\times 0.5 \\times \\frac{5}{100} = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{mL} \\times 0.5 \\times 0.05 = 0.025\\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\nSo, $\\lambda = C_{LOD} \\times F = C_{LOD} \\times 0.025$.\n\n- **Final LOD Calculation:**\nWe need $\\lambda \\ge 3.0$. Therefore:\n$$C_{LOD} \\times 0.025 \\ge 3.0$$\n$$C_{LOD} \\ge \\frac{3.0}{0.025} = \\frac{3.0}{1/40} = 3.0 \\times 40 = 120\\ \\mathrm{genome\\ copies/mL}$$\nThe LOD of the assay is approximately $120\\ \\mathrm{genome\\ copies/mL}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. PCR targets DNA and does not require viable cells; after $2\\ \\mathrm{h}$ of antibiotics, viability falls by about $10^{2}$-fold but amplifiable DNA declines only by a factor of approximately $2^{-2/3}\\approx 0.63$, so abundant target remains. With $1.0\\ \\mathrm{mL}$ input, $50\\%$ recovery, and a $5/100$ template fraction, the expected genomes per reaction are $0.025$ times the concentration in $\\mathrm{genome\\ copies/mL}$, and achieving a $95\\%$ chance of at least one target requires a mean of about $3$ genomes per reaction, giving an LOD near $120\\ \\mathrm{genome\\ copies/mL}$.**\nThis option correctly states that PCR targets DNA, independent of viability. It correctly calculates the decline in viability ($10^2$-fold) and the decline in DNA ($2^{-2/3}$). It correctly deduces that ample target remains. It correctly calculates the processing factor ($0.025$), the required mean genomes per reaction ($\\lambda \\approx 3$), and the resulting LOD ($120\\ \\mathrm{genome\\ copies/mL}$). Every statement and calculation is accurate based on the provided data.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. PCR requires viable bacteria to replicate the template; antibiotics prevent growth, so sensitivity drops sharply and the LOD increases to about $10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{genome\\ copies/mL}$.**\nThis option's central premise, \"PCR requires viable bacteria\", is fundamentally false and directly contradicts Principle 1 given in the problem statement. Therefore, all conclusions drawn from this premise are invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Antibiotics lyse bacteria and thereby transiently increase free DNA, making the assay effectively perfect; the LOD improves to about $1\\ \\mathrm{genome\\ copy/mL}$ regardless of extraction and aliquoting.**\nThis option makes several unsupported claims. While lysis might release DNA, the problem states the *total* amplifiable DNA decays with a $3$-hour half-life, so there is no basis for assuming a net increase or a \"perfect\" assay. The claim that the LOD is independent of \"extraction and aliquoting\" is physically impossible; these steps inevitably introduce sample loss and dilution, which define the assay's analytical sensitivity. An LOD of $1\\ \\mathrm{copy/mL}$ would yield a $\\lambda = 1 \\times 0.025 = 0.025$, giving a detection probability of $1-e^{-0.025} \\approx 2.5\\%$, far below the required $95\\%$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. PCR primarily reflects ribonucleic acid (RNA) transcripts, which decay rapidly after antibiotics; thus PCR becomes insensitive and the LOD is on the order of $10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{genome\\ copies/mL}$.**\nThis option is incorrect because the problem explicitly refers to \"Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)\" amplifying \"deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)\". Standard PCR does not detect RNA; that requires Reverse Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR).

For a drug administered intravenously in a one-compartment model, the plasma concentration ($C_p$) as a function of time ($t$) after a single dose ($D$) is given by:\n$$C_p(t) = C_{p,0} \\exp(-k_e t)$$\nwhere $C_{p,0}$ is the initial concentration and $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\nThe elimination rate constant, $k_e$, is related to the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, by:\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\nUsing the given value $t_{1/2} = 8$ hours:\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{8} \\text{ h}^{-1}$$\n\nThe total volume of distribution, $V$, is calculated from the mass-specific value $v_d$ and the patient's body mass $m$:\n$$V = v_d \\times m = 0.12 \\text{ L/kg} \\times 70 \\text{ kg} = 8.4 \\text{ L}$$\n\nFor a multiple-dosing regimen at steady state, the concentration profile within a single dosing interval $\\tau$ (from $t=0$ to $t=\\tau$) is described by:\n$$C_{p,ss}(t) = C_{p,max,ss} \\exp(-k_e t)$$\nwhere $C_{p,max,ss}$ is the peak plasma concentration at steady state, occurring at $t=0$ immediately after the IV dose. It is calculated by summing the geometric series of remaining drug from all previous doses:\n$$C_{p,max,ss} = \\frac{D/V}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)}$$\n\nWe can now substitute the known values:\n$$C_{p,max,ss} = \\frac{2000 \\text{ mg} / 8.4 \\text{ L}}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{8} \\text{ h}^{-1} \\times 12 \\text{ h}\\right)} = \\frac{2000/8.4}{1 - \\exp(-1.5 \\ln(2))} = \\frac{2000/8.4}{1 - 2^{-1.5}}$$\n$$C_{p,max,ss} = \\frac{2000/8.4}{1 - \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}} \\approx \\frac{238.1}{1 - 0.35355} \\approx 368.3 \\text{ mg/L}$$\n\nThe free drug concentration in plasma is $C_{p,free}(t) = f_u \\times C_p(t)$.

This means that a vaccinated individual's susceptibility is reduced from $1$ to $1-e$.\n\nThe average susceptibility of the population, $\\bar{s}$, is the weighted average of the susceptibilities of the vaccinated and unvaccinated subpopulations, with the weights being their respective proportions in the total population.\n\n$$\\bar{s} = (\\text{susceptibility of unvaccinated}) \\times (\\text{fraction unvaccinated}) + (\\text{susceptibility of vaccinated}) \\times (\\text{fraction vaccinated})$$\n\nSubstituting the defined values into this expression:\n\n$$\\bar{s} = (1) \\times (1-v) + (1-e) \\times (v)$$\n\nSimplifying this expression gives the average susceptibility as a function of vaccination coverage $v$ and vaccine efficacy $e$:\n\n$$\\bar{s} = 1 - v + v - ev = 1 - ev$$\n\nNow, we can express the Effective Reproduction Number, $R_e$, in terms of $R_0$, $v$, and $e$:\n\n$$R_e = R_0 \\bar{s} = R_0 (1 - ev)$$\n\nFor the epidemic to decline and no longer be self-sustaining, the number of new infections generated by each existing infection must be, on average, less than one. This corresponds to the condition $R_e < 1$. The critical vaccination coverage, $v_c^{\\star}$, is the minimum value of $v$ that satisfies this condition. We find this threshold by setting $R_e = 1$:\n\n$$1 = R_0 (1 - ev_c^{\\star})$$\n\nTo solve for $v_c^{\\star}$, we rearrange the equation. We can divide by $R_0$, assuming $R_0 > 1$, which is a necessary condition for a sustained epidemic to exist in the first place.\n\n$$\\frac{1}{R_0} = 1 - ev_c^{\\star}$$\n\nNext, we isolate the term containing $v_c^{\\star}$:\n\n$$ev_c^{\\star} = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n\nCombining the terms on the right-hand side yields:\n\n$$ev_c^{\\star} = \\frac{R_0 - 1}{R_0}$$\n\nFinally, dividing by the vaccine efficacy parameter $e$ gives the expression for the minimal vaccination coverage threshold, $v_c^{\\star}$:\n\n$$v_c^{\\star} = \\frac{R_0 - 1}{eR_0}$$\n\nThis expression represents the minimum fraction of the population that must be vaccinated with a leaky vaccine of efficacy $e$ to bring the Effective Reproduction Number to $1$, thereby halting the sustained transmission of the pathogen.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{R_0 - 1}{e R_0}}$$", "id": "4672644"}]}
