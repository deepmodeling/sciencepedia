Based on regional epidemiology and clinical presentation, the clinician estimates a pretest probability of infection of $0.20$ for a rickettsial pathogen in this complex (for example, Ehrlichia chaffeensis or Anaplasma phagocytophilum).

It is a standard, well-posed problem in applied probability theory. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nLet us define the events:\n-   $D$: The event that the patient has the rickettsial disease.\n-   $D^c$: The event that the patient does not have the rickettsial disease.\n-   $T^+$: The event that the PCR test result is positive.\n-   $T^-$: The event that the PCR test result is negative.\n\nThe givens can be formally expressed as probabilities:\n-   Pretest probability (prevalence): $P(D) = 0.20$.\n-   Sensitivity: $P(T^+ | D) = 0.90$.\n-   Specificity: $P(T^- | D^c) = 0.97$.\n\nFrom these, we can deduce other necessary probabilities:\n-   The probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n-   The probability of a negative test given the disease (false negative rate) is $P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n-   The probability of a positive test given no disease (false positive rate) is $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.97 = 0.03$.\n\nThe task is to derive and compute the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV).\n\n**Derivation and Calculation of Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\n\nThe PPV is the probability that a patient has the disease given a positive test result, which is denoted by $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nWe start with Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test. It can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting this into the Bayes' theorem expression gives the full formula for PPV in terms of the initial parameters:\n$$\\text{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}$$\nThis is the derived expression for PPV.

It can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)$$\nSubstituting this into the Bayes' theorem expression gives the full formula for NPV:\n$$\\text{NPV} = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)}$$\nThis is the derived expression for NPV.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part calculation: the specific dose for the child and the resulting steady-state average plasma concentration. The solution will proceed by addressing each part in order, based on fundamental pharmacokinetic principles.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the per-dose amount**\n\nThe dose is specified on a per-kilogram basis.
