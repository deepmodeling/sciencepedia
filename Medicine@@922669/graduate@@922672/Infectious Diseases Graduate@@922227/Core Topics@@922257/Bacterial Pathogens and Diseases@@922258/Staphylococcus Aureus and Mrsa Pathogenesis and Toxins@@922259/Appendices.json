Increased expression of cytolytic exoproteins such as alpha-hemolysin and phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs), enhanced tissue necrosis with a propensity for acute toxin-mediated syndromes (for example, necrotizing pneumonia), reduced biofilm formation, and improved efficacy of glycopeptide therapy due to greater bacterial metabolic activity.\n\nB. Decreased expression of cytolytic toxins and exoproteases, increased expression of surface adhesins (for example, clumping factors, fibronectin-binding proteins, and protein A), enhanced biofilm stability with reduced dispersal, a clinical tendency toward persistent device-associated infection and bacteremia, and an association with reduced responsiveness to vancomycin linked to intermediate glycopeptide phenotypes.\n\nC. Upregulation of protein A and coagulase drives more aggressive abscess formation by accelerating neutrophil lysis through increased phenol-soluble modulins, thereby shifting toward acute toxin-mediated disease rather than chronic device-associated infection.\n\nD. agr-defective strains experience paradoxical hyperactivation of quorum sensing at low cell density, increasing superantigen production (for example, toxic shock syndrome toxin 1), and predisposing to toxic shock syndrome during asymptomatic nasal colonization.\n\nE.
