The problem is scientifically grounded and well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nLet $R$ represent the free DbpA binding sites on the bacterial surface, $L$ represent the free decorin molecules in the microenvironment, and $RL$ represent the DbpA-decorin complex. The interaction is described as a single-site, reversible binding process at equilibrium:\n$$ R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL $$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action at equilibrium:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]} $$\nwhere $[R]$, $[L]$, and $[RL]$ are the molar concentrations of the free receptor, free ligand, and the receptor-ligand complex, respectively.\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is the fraction of total DbpA binding sites that are occupied by decorin. It is defined as:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{\\text{Concentration of occupied sites}}{\\text{Total concentration of sites}} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T} $$\nwhere $[R]_T$ is the total concentration of DbpA binding sites.\n\nAccording to the principle of mass conservation for the receptor, the total concentration of DbpA sites is the sum of the free sites and the occupied sites:\n$$ [R]_T = [R] + [RL] $$\n\nTo derive an expression for $\\theta$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_d$, we can rearrange the dissociation constant equation to express $[R]$ in terms of the other species:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the mass conservation equation for the receptor gives:\n$$ [R]_T = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} + [RL] $$\nFactoring out $[RL]$ on the right-hand side yields:\n$$ [R]_T = [RL] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1 \\right) $$\nTo find the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, we rearrange this equation to solve for the ratio $\\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T}$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1} $$\nSimplifying this complex fraction by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the main fraction by $[L]$ gives the standard form of the binding isotherm equation (sometimes known as the Langmuir isotherm or Hill-Langmuir equation for non-cooperative binding):\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]} $$\nThis is the required expression for fractional occupancy. The problem states that decorin is in large excess, meaning ligand depletion is negligible. This validates the use of the given free decorin concentration, $[L]$, directly in our derived formula without needing to account for the amount of ligand bound to DbpA.\n\nNow, we can evaluate $\\theta$ using the given parameter values:\nThe dissociation constant is $K_d = 50\\,\\text{nM}$.\nThe free decorin concentration is $[L] = 200\\,\\text{nM}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{200\\,\\text{nM}}{50\\,\\text{nM} + 200\\,\\text{nM}} = \\frac{200\\,\\text{nM}}{250\\,\\text{nM}} $$\nThe units of concentration (nM) cancel out, resulting in a unitless fraction:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{200}{250} = \\frac{20}{25} = \\frac{4}{5} $$\nAs a decimal, this is:\n$$ \\theta = 0.8 $$\n\nFinally, we explain the biological significance of this result. A fractional occupancy of $\\theta = 0.8$ means that at equilibrium, $80\\%$ of the DbpA adhesins on the surface of *Borrelia burgdorferi* are bound to decorin. Since DbpA is an adhesin that mediates attachment to the host's extracellular matrix (ECM), and decorin is a key component of the ECM in synovial joints, this high level of occupancy indicates a very strong and stable attachment of the bacteria to the joint tissue. This attachment is a critical step for bacterial colonization and persistence within the host. A high likelihood of attachment directly translates to a high likelihood of successful colonization, which can lead to the chronic inflammation and tissue damage characteristic of Lyme arthritis. Therefore, the high calculated occupancy of $0.8$ strongly supports the role of the DbpA-decorin interaction in the pathogenesis of joint-related Lyme disease.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.8}\n$$", "id": "4631556"}, {"introduction": "Interpreting diagnostic tests for Lyme disease is a core clinical skill that extends beyond knowing a test's sensitivity and specificity.

The use of CSF and serum antibody and total protein levels to construct a normalized index (often associated with the Reibergram) is a fundamental diagnostic tool for central nervous system infections and inflammatory diseases. The analyte (*Borrelia burgdorferi* IgG) and clinical context (meningoradiculitis) are appropriate. The provided values are within a realistic clinical range.

The instruction for rounding is unambiguous. A unique, stable solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in objective, clinical language, free of bias or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the antibody index (AI) for *Borrelia burgdorferi* specific IgG. This index is designed to distinguish between specific antibodies that have crossed the blood–brain barrier (BBB) passively from the blood and those that have been actively synthesized within the central nervous system (intrathecal synthesis). It achieves this by normalizing the specific antibody ratio against the total antibody ratio, which serves as a marker for general BBB permeability and systemic IgG levels.\n\nThe formula for the antibody index, as described in the problem, is:\n$$ AI = \\frac{Q_{spec}}{Q_{total}} $$\nwhere $Q_{spec}$ is the quotient of the specific anti-Borrelia IgG concentrations in CSF and serum, and $Q_{total}$ is the quotient of the total IgG concentrations in CSF and serum.\n\nLet us define the given variables formally:\n- $C_{spec, CSF} = 1.5\\ \\mathrm{AU/mL}$ (Specific IgG concentration in CSF)\n- $C_{spec, S} = 150\\ \\mathrm{AU/mL}$ (Specific IgG concentration in serum)\n- $C_{total, CSF} = 30\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$ (Total IgG concentration in CSF)\n- $C_{total, S} = 10\\ \\mathrm{g/L}$ (Total IgG concentration in serum)\n\nThe quotients are:\n$$ Q_{spec} = \\frac{C_{spec, CSF}}{C_{spec, S}} $$\n$$ Q_{total} = \\frac{C_{total, CSF}}{C_{total, S}} $$\n\nSubstituting these into the AI formula gives:\n$$ AI = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{C_{spec, CSF}}{C_{spec, S}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{C_{total, CSF}}{C_{total, S}} \\right)} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the quotient for the specific anti-Borrelia IgG, $Q_{spec}$. The units are arbitrary units per milliliter ($\\mathrm{AU/mL}$) for both measurements, so they are consistent and will cancel.\n$$ Q_{spec} = \\frac{1.5\\ \\mathrm{AU/mL}}{150\\ \\mathrm{AU/mL}} = \\frac{1.5}{150} = 0.01 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the quotient for the total IgG, $Q_{total}$. The units are inconsistent: milligrams per liter ($\\mathrm{mg/L}$) for CSF and grams per liter ($\\mathrm{g/L}$) for serum. We must convert them to a common unit before calculating the ratio. We will convert grams to milligrams, using the conversion factor $1\\ \\mathrm{g} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{mg}$.\n\n$$ C_{total, S} = 10\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{1000\\ \\mathrm{mg}}{1\\ \\mathrm{g}} = 10000\\ \\mathrm{mg/L} $$\n\nNow we can calculate $Q_{total}$, which will also be a dimensionless quantity.\n$$ Q_{total} = \\frac{30\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}}{10000\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}} = \\frac{30}{10000} = 0.003 $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the antibody index by taking the ratio of the two quotients.\n$$ AI = \\frac{Q_{spec}}{Q_{total}} = \\frac{0.01}{0.003} = \\frac{1/100}{3/1000} = \\frac{1}{100} \\times \\frac{1000}{3} = \\frac{10}{3} $$\n$$ AI = 3.333... $$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ AI \\approx 3.33 $$\n\n**Interpretation of the Result:**\nThe antibody index corrects for the passive transfer of serum IgG into the CSF. If the specific antibodies in the CSF are present only due to transfer from the blood, the ratio of specific antibody concentrations ($Q_{spec}$) should be approximately equal to the ratio of total IgG concentrations ($Q_{total}$), resulting in an $AI$ value of approximately $1.0$.\n\nAn $AI$ value significantly greater than $1.0$ indicates that the proportion of specific antibody is higher in the CSF than in the serum, which is evidence of local, intrathecal synthesis of that specific antibody. In the clinical context of neuroborreliosis, a positive finding for intrathecal synthesis is a key diagnostic criterion. The diagnostic cutoff for a positive result is typically set at an $AI$ value of $1.5$ or greater, though this can vary slightly between laboratories (e.g., $1.3$ to $1.5$).\n\nThe calculated antibody index of $3.33$ is substantially greater than the common diagnostic threshold of $1.5$. This result provides strong evidence for the intrathecal production of anti-Borrelia IgG antibodies and, in conjunction with the patient's clinical signs of meningoradiculitis, strongly supports the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.33}$$", "id": "4614731"}]}
