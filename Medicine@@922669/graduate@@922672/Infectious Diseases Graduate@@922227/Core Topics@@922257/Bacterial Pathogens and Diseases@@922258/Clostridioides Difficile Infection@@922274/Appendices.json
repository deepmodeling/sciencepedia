After multivariable adjustment for relevant confounders, the association between prior clindamycin exposure and CDI yields an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of $3.0$. The prevalence of clindamycin exposure in the source population during the relevant risk window is $0.20$. Assume the following: (i) Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) incidence is sufficiently low in the source population over the study interval that the odds ratio (OR) approximates the relative risk (RR), (ii) removal of exposure would reduce risk in the exposed to the risk observed in the unexposed without compensatory changes in other risks, and (iii) confounding has been adequately controlled so that the estimated association is causal.

Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\text{PAF} = \\frac{R_{pop} - R'_{pop}}{R_{pop}}\n$$\nwhere $R'_{pop}$ is the new, counterfactual risk in the population after the complete removal of the exposure.\n\nThe overall risk in the population, $R_{pop}$, is a weighted average of the risks in the exposed and unexposed subgroups, weighted by their respective prevalences:\n$$\nR_{pop} = (R_{exp} \\times P_e) + (R_{unexp} \\times P_{ne})\n$$\nSubstituting $P_{ne} = 1 - P_e$, we have:\n$$\nR_{pop} = (R_{exp} \\times P_e) + (R_{unexp} \\times (1 - P_e))\n$$\nAccording to assumption (ii), if the exposure were eliminated, those individuals who were previously exposed would now experience the risk of the unexposed. Therefore, the entire population would have a risk equal to $R_{unexp}$. The new population risk, $R'_{pop}$, is thus:\n$$\nR'_{pop} = R_{unexp}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of PAF:\n$$\n\\text{PAF} = \\frac{R_{pop} - R_{unexp}}{R_{pop}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $R_{pop}$:\n$$\n\\text{PAF} = \\frac{[(R_{exp} \\times P_e) + (R_{unexp} \\times (1 - P_e))] - R_{unexp}}{(R_{exp} \\times P_e) + (R_{unexp} \\times (1 - P_e))}\n$$\nLet's simplify the numerator:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = R_{exp} P_e + R_{unexp} - R_{unexp} P_e - R_{unexp} = R_{exp} P_e - R_{unexp} P_e = P_e (R_{exp} - R_{unexp})\n$$\nSo the expression for PAF becomes:\n$$\n\\text{PAF} = \\frac{P_e (R_{exp} - R_{unexp})}{R_{pop}} = \\frac{P_e (R_{exp} - R_{unexp})}{(R_{exp} \\times P_e) + (R_{unexp} \\times (1 - P_e))}\n$$\nTo express this in terms of $RR$ and $P_e$, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by $R_{unexp}$ (assuming $R_{unexp} > 0$):\n$$\n\\text{PAF} = \\frac{P_e \\left(\\frac{R_{exp}}{R_{unexp}} - \\frac{R_{unexp}}{R_{unexp}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{R_{exp}}{R_{unexp}} \\times P_e\\right) + \\left(\\frac{R_{unexp}}{R_{unexp}} \\times (1 - P_e)\\right)}\n$$\nSubstituting $RR = \\frac{R_{exp}}{R_{unexp}}$ into this equation, we get:\n$$\n\\text{PAF} = \\frac{P_e (RR - 1)}{(RR \\times P_e) + (1 \\times (1 - P_e))}\n$$\nSimplifying the denominator:\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = P_e \\cdot RR + 1 - P_e = 1 + P_e \\cdot RR - P_e = 1 + P_e(RR - 1)\n$$\nThus, the derived expression for PAF in terms of exposure prevalence ($P_e$) and relative risk ($RR$) is:\n$$\n\\text{PAF} = \\frac{P_e(RR - 1)}{1 + P_e(RR - 1)}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must compute the numerical value of the PAF. The problem provides the following parameters:\n- The prevalence of clindamycin exposure in the source population, $P_e = 0.20$.\n- The adjusted odds ratio (OR) is $3.0$.\n- Assumption (i) states that the odds ratio approximates the relative risk, so we can set $RR \\approx 3.0$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for PAF:\n$$\n\\text{PAF} = \\frac{0.20(3.0 - 1)}{1 + 0.20(3.0 - 1)}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the term $(RR - 1)$:\n$$\n3.0 - 1 = 2.0\n$$\nNow, substitute this back into the equation:\n$$\n\\text{PAF} = \\frac{0.20(2.0)}{1 + 0.20(2.0)}\n$$\nCalculate the numerator and the term in the denominator:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = 0.20 \\times 2.0 = 0.40\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = 1 + (0.20 \\times 2.0) = 1 + 0.40 = 1.40\n$$\nSo, the PAF is:\n$$\n\\text{PAF} = \\frac{0.40}{1.40} = \\frac{4}{14} = \\frac{2}{7}\n$$\nTo express this as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\n\\text{PAF} = \\frac{2}{7} \\approx 0.28571428...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\n\\text{PAF} \\approx 0.2857\n$$\nThis value indicates that approximately $28.57\\%$ of *Clostridioides difficile* infections in this inpatient population are attributable to clindamycin exposure, under the specified assumptions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2857}$$", "id": "4816270"}, {"introduction": "A frequent challenge in diagnosing CDI is navigating ambiguous or discordant laboratory results, such as a positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) but a negative toxin assay.

Toxin EIA detects free toxin and correlates more closely with clinically significant toxin-mediated disease but has imperfect sensitivity.\n- Broad-spectrum oral anti–Clostridioides difficile antibiotics disrupt the gut microbiome to varying degrees; oral vancomycin markedly perturbs the microbiome and increases risk of future Clostridioides difficile acquisition/recurrence relative to no treatment, whereas fidaxomicin is more microbiota-sparing but still exerts selective pressure.\n- In diagnostic decision-making, the post-test probability can be estimated via Bayes’ theorem from a clinically estimated pretest probability and test characteristics, and a rational treatment threshold can be set by comparing expected benefit and harm.\n\nFor this patient, your institution’s infectious diseases service has published the following parameters derived from local data for clinically significant toxin-mediated CDI among patients with low pretest probability features (fewer than $3$ unformed stools in $24$ hours and recent laxative use), which you may assume are applicable here:\n- Estimated pretest probability of toxin-mediated CDI: $P(D)=0.10$.\n- NAAT sensitivity $P(\\text{NAAT}+\\mid D)=0.95$ and specificity $P(\\text{NAAT}-\\mid \\neg D)=0.90$ for toxin-mediated CDI.\n- Toxin EIA sensitivity $P(\\text{Toxin}+\\mid D)=0.60$ and specificity $P(\\text{Toxin}-\\mid \\neg D)=0.95$ for toxin-mediated CDI.\n- For the purpose of this calculation, assume conditional independence of NAAT and toxin EIA given the true disease state.\n- If toxin-mediated CDI is present and immediate therapy is initiated in non-severe cases, the absolute risk reduction in serious clinical deterioration (composite of progression to severe colitis, need for intensive care, colectomy, or death) is approximately $B=0.05$ relative to careful observation with supportive care over the next $48$ hours.\n- If toxin-mediated CDI is absent and oral vancomycin is given unnecessarily, the absolute risk increase for subsequent clinically significant CDI within $60$ days due to microbiome disruption is approximately $H=0.05$ compared with withholding therapy.

The decision must be derived from first principles, including Bayesian reasoning and a treatment threshold analysis based on provided data.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe core task is to calculate the post-test probability of toxin-mediated CDI given the patient's test results and compare this to a rationally derived treatment threshold.\n\n**A. Calculation of Post-Test Probability of Disease**\nWe need to find the probability of disease ($D$) given the evidence ($E$), which consists of a positive NAAT ($\\text{NAAT}+$) and a negative Toxin EIA ($\\text{Toxin}-$). The post-test probability is $P(D \\mid \\text{NAAT}+, \\text{Toxin}-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(D \\mid E) = \\frac{P(E \\mid D) P(D)}{P(E \\mid D) P(D) + P(E \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)} $$\nDue to conditional independence of the tests:\n$P(E \\mid D) = P(\\text{NAAT}+ \\mid D) \\times P(\\text{Toxin}- \\mid D)$\n$P(E \\mid \\neg D) = P(\\text{NAAT}+ \\mid \\neg D) \\times P(\\text{Toxin}- \\mid \\neg D)$\n\nFirst, we compile the necessary probabilities from the givens:\n-   $P(D) = 0.10$\n-   $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$\n-   $P(\\text{NAAT}+ \\mid D) = 0.95$\n-   $P(\\text{Toxin}- \\mid D) = 1 - P(\\text{Toxin}+ \\mid D) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$\n-   $P(\\text{NAAT}+ \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - P(\\text{NAAT}- \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$\n-   $P(\\text{Toxin}- \\mid \\neg D) = 0.95$\n\nNow, we calculate the joint likelihoods:\n-   Likelihood of the evidence if disease is present: $P(E \\mid D) = 0.95 \\times 0.40 = 0.38$\n-   Likelihood of the evidence if disease is absent: $P(E \\mid \\neg D) = 0.10 \\times 0.95 = 0.095$\n\nNext, we substitute these into Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(D \\mid \\text{NAAT}+, \\text{Toxin}-) = \\frac{(0.38)(0.10)}{(0.38)(0.10) + (0.095)(0.90)} $$\n$$ P(D \\mid \\text{NAAT}+, \\text{Toxin}-) = \\frac{0.038}{0.038 + 0.0855} = \\frac{0.038}{0.1235} \\approx 0.3077 $$\nThe post-test probability that this patient has clinically significant, toxin-mediated CDI is approximately $30.8\\%$.\n\n**B. Calculation of the Treatment Threshold**\nThe decision to treat is rational if the expected benefit of treatment exceeds the expected harm. The treatment threshold probability, $p_T$, is the point of equipoise where the expected benefit of treating equals the expected harm of treating. This occurs when the net expected utility of treatment is zero.\n$$ p_T \\times B = (1 - p_T) \\times H $$\nwhere $B$ is the benefit of treating a true positive and $H$ is the harm of treating a false positive.\nRearranging for $p_T$:\n$$ p_T = \\frac{H}{B + H} $$\nUsing the provided values $B=0.05$ and $H=0.05$:\n$$ p_T = \\frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.05} = \\frac{0.05}{0.10} = 0.50 $$\nThe treatment threshold is $50\\%$. Treatment should be initiated only if the post-test probability of disease is greater than $50\\%$.\n\n**C. Decision Synthesis**\nThe calculated post-test probability of CDI is $p \\approx 30.8\\%$. The calculated treatment threshold is $p_T = 50\\%$.\nSince $p < p_T$ ($30.8\\% < 50\\%$), the quantitative analysis indicates that withholding anti-CDI therapy is the most appropriate action. The expected harm of unnecessary treatment outweighs the expected benefit of treatment at this level of diagnostic certainty.\n\nThis conclusion is strongly supported by the qualitative clinical data: the patient is stable, has mild symptoms that may be attributable to a laxative, and did not meet standard criteria for testing in the first place. The NAAT+/toxin- result is most consistent with asymptomatic colonization, which should not be treated. The appropriate management is therefore to withhold specific CDI therapy, address other contributing factors (laxatives, other antibiotics), implement infection control measures (as the patient is colonized and can be a source of transmission), and monitor for any clinical worsening that would prompt reassessment.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Withhold anti–Clostridioides difficile therapy now; stop laxatives and de-escalate non–Clostridioides difficile antibiotics if possible, maintain enteric isolation, and reassess in $24$–$48$ hours; initiate therapy only if symptoms persist or worsen or if severe features develop.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option aligns perfectly with our derived conclusion. The decision to withhold therapy is justified by the post-test probability ($30.8\\%$) being below the treatment threshold ($50\\%$). The additional management steps (stopping laxatives, antibiotic stewardship, isolation, and watchful waiting) represent a comprehensive and correct clinical plan for managing a patient with probable *C. difficile* colonization and mild, non-specific symptoms.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Initiate oral vancomycin now because NAAT positivity indicates the presence of a toxigenic strain and recent systemic antibiotics increase risk.**\n-   **Analysis**: This approach ignores the high probability of colonization, the negative toxin EIA result, the mild clinical picture, and the explicit results of the Bayesian analysis. Treating based on NAAT positivity alone leads to significant overtreatment of colonization, which carries the harm of microbiome disruption and increased future CDI risk, quantified here as $H=0.05$. The formal analysis proves this course of action is not optimal.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Initiate fidaxomicin now to minimize microbiome disruption despite a negative toxin EIA, because early therapy reduces complications even in mild cases.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option is incorrect for two main reasons. First, the analysis shows that *any* anti-CDI therapy is not currently indicated. Second, the problem statement specifies that oral vancomycin is the only readily available first-line agent, making the suggestion of fidaxomicin contrary to the scenario's constraints. The argument for \"early therapy\" is fallacious when the probability of the disease being present is low and below the calculated treatment threshold.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Administer bezlotoxumab alone to prevent recurrence while withholding antibiotics, given the negative toxin EIA.**\n-   **Analysis**: This represents a misunderstanding of the indication for bezlotoxumab. Bezlotoxumab is an adjunctive therapy used alongside standard-of-care antibiotics to prevent *recurrence* in high-risk patients. It is not a monotherapy for active CDI, nor is it used for patients who are merely colonized and not receiving CDI treatment. This action is not evidence-based.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Repeat NAAT immediately on a new stool specimen; if still positive, treat for CDI.**\n-   **Analysis**: This is a clinically unhelpful strategy. The patient is already known to be NAAT-positive, indicating colonization with a toxigenic strain. A repeat NAAT will almost certainly be positive and will not resolve the diagnostic uncertainty of infection versus colonization. The proposed treatment trigger (\"if still positive, treat\") is the same flawed logic as in option B, which our analysis has shown to be inappropriate.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4634778"}, {"introduction": "Effective management of CDI extends beyond initial treatment to the prevention of recurrence, which often involves advanced pharmacologic strategies.

Oral vancomycin is then administered as a pulse-taper, motivated by Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD): after each oral pulse at time $t_{i}$, the colonic luminal concentration $c(t)$ is approximated by a monoexponential decay $c(t) = C_{\\text{peak}} \\exp\\!\\big(-k (t - t_{i})\\big)$ for $t \\ge t_{i}$ and $c(t) = 0$ for $t < t_{i}$, where $k$ (per hour) is the effective first-order elimination rate and $C_{\\text{peak}}$ is the effective peak luminal concentration achieved by each pulse.

The minimum value of $J(\\tau)$ in this region is attained at the highest possible value of $\\tau$, which is $\\tau = A$.\n\nCase 2: $\\tau > A$.\nIn this case, the protected intervals are disjoint, as the protection from pulse $i$ ends at $i\\tau + A$, before the next pulse at $(i+1)\\tau$. This creates gaps between the pulses.\nThe gap set is $\\mathcal{G}(\\tau) = \\left( \\bigcup_{i=0}^{N-2} (i\\tau+A, (i+1)\\tau) \\right) \\cup ((N-1)\\tau+A, T]$.\nThe integral to minimize is:\n$$J(\\tau) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2} \\int_{i\\tau+A}^{(i+1)\\tau} \\exp(-\\lambda t) dt + \\int_{(N-1)\\tau+A}^{T} \\exp(-\\lambda t) dt$$\nWe compute the derivative with respect to $\\tau$ using the Leibniz integral rule:\n$$\\frac{d}{d\\tau} \\int_{a(\\tau)}^{b(\\tau)} f(t) dt = f(b(\\tau))b'(\\tau) - f(a(\\tau))a'(\\tau)$$\nFor the terms in the sum:\n$$\\frac{d}{d\\tau} \\int_{i\\tau+A}^{(i+1)\\tau} \\exp(-\\lambda t) dt = \\exp(-\\lambda(i+1)\\tau) \\cdot (i+1) - \\exp(-\\lambda(i\\tau+A)) \\cdot i$$\nFor the last term:\n$$\\frac{d}{d\\tau} \\int_{(N-1)\\tau+A}^{T} \\exp(-\\lambda t) dt = 0 - \\exp(-\\lambda((N-1)\\tau+A)) \\cdot (N-1)$$\nSumming these gives the total derivative $\\frac{dJ}{d\\tau}$:\n$$\\frac{dJ}{d\\tau} = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2} \\left[ (i+1)\\exp(-\\lambda(i+1)\\tau) - i\\exp(-\\lambda(i\\tau+A)) \\right] - (N-1)\\exp(-\\lambda((N-1)\\tau+A))$$\nLet's re-index the sum by letting $j = i+1$:\n$$\\frac{dJ}{d\\tau} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} j\\exp(-\\lambda j\\tau) - \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2} i\\exp(-\\lambda(i\\tau+A)) - (N-1)\\exp(-\\lambda((N-1)\\tau+A))$$\nThe $i=0$ term in the second sum is zero. So we can start it from $i=1$.\n$$\\frac{dJ}{d\\tau} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} i\\exp(-\\lambda i\\tau) - \\sum_{i=1}^{N-2} i\\exp(-\\lambda(i\\tau+A)) - (N-1)\\exp(-\\lambda((N-1)\\tau+A))$$\nSeparating the $i=N-1$ term from the first sum:\n$$\\frac{dJ}{d\\tau} = (N-1)\\exp(-\\lambda(N-1)\\tau) + \\sum_{i=1}^{N-2} i\\exp(-\\lambda i\\tau) - \\sum_{i=1}^{N-2} i\\exp(-\\lambda(i\\tau+A)) - (N-1)\\exp(-\\lambda((N-1)\\tau+A))$$\nGrouping terms by index $i$:\n$$\\frac{dJ}{d\\tau} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-2} i\\left[\\exp(-\\lambda i\\tau) - \\exp(-\\lambda(i\\tau+A))\\right] + (N-1)\\left[\\exp(-\\lambda(N-1)\\tau) - \\exp(-\\lambda((N-1)\\tau+A))\\right]$$\nThis can be written compactly as:\n$$\\frac{dJ}{d\\tau} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} i\\left[\\exp(-\\lambda i\\tau) - \\exp(-\\lambda(i\\tau+A))\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} i \\exp(-\\lambda i\\tau) (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda A))$$\nFor $\\tau > A$, all terms in this expression are positive for $N \\ge 2$:\n$i \\ge 1$ is positive.\n$\\exp(-\\lambda i\\tau)$ is positive.\nSince $A = \\Delta t_{\\text{prot}} > 0$ and $\\lambda > 0$, we have $\\exp(-\\lambda A) < 1$, so $(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda A))$ is positive.\nTherefore, $\\frac{dJ}{dtau} > 0$ for all $\\tau > A$. This shows that $J(\\tau)$ is a strictly increasing function in this region. The minimum value would be approached as $\\tau$ approaches $A$ from above.\n\nCombining the analyses of both cases, the function $J(\\tau)$ representing the core of the regrowth probability is decreasing for $\\tau \\le A$ and increasing for $\\tau > A$. The global minimum of $J(\\tau)$ therefore occurs at $\\tau = A$.\n\nThe optimal inter-pulse interval $\\tau^*$ is thus equal to the duration of protection from a single pulse.\n$$\\tau^* = \\Delta t_{\\text{prot}} = \\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{\\text{peak}}}{C_{\\text{thr}}}\\right)$$\nThis optimal interval ensures that the concentration never drops below $C_{\\text{thr}}$ between pulses, providing continuous protection for the longest possible duration for a given number of pulses, thereby minimizing the probability of germination in an unprotected gap. The result is independent of $S_0$, $N$, $T$, and $\\lambda$, as required by the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{\\text{peak}}}{C_{\\text{thr}}}\\right)}$$", "id": "4634792"}]}
