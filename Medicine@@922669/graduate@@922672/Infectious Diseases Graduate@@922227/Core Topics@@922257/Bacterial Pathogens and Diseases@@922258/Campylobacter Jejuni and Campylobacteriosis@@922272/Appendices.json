It is scientifically grounded in the principles of microbial kinetics, specifically the exponential growth model for bacteria under non-limiting conditions. The parameters provided for *Campylobacter jejuni* are realistic. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information ($N_0$, $\\tau$, $t$) to derive a unique solution, and is free from ambiguity or contradiction.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in two parts as requested: first, deriving a general expression for the population size $N(t)$, and second, applying it to the given numerical values.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Closed-Form Expression for $N(t)$**\n\nThe problem is founded on the principle of a constant doubling time, $\\tau$, which is characteristic of exponential growth during the logarithmic phase. This implies that for any time interval of duration $\\tau$, the population of cells doubles. Let $N(t)$ be the number of cells at time $t$, with an initial population $N(0) = N_0$.\n\nWe can describe the population size at discrete time intervals that are integer multiples of the doubling time $\\tau$.\nAt time $t=0$, the population is $N(0) = N_0$.\nAfter one doubling time, at $t=\\tau$, the population has doubled once:\n$$N(\\tau) = N_0 \\times 2 = N_0 \\times 2^1$$\nAfter two doubling times, at $t=2\\tau$, the population has doubled twice:\n$$N(2\\tau) = N(\\tau) \\times 2 = (N_0 \\times 2) \\times 2 = N_0 \\times 2^2$$\nFollowing this pattern, after $k$ doubling times, where $k$ is a non-negative integer, the time is $t=k\\tau$ and the population is:\n$$N(k\\tau) = N_0 \\times 2^k$$\nTo generalize this expression for any time $t \\ge 0$, we consider the number of doubling periods that have elapsed by time $t$. This quantity is given by the ratio of the total time $t$ to the doubling time $\\tau$. We can therefore substitute $k = \\frac{t}{\\tau}$ into the previous expression. This holds for non-integer values of $t/\\tau$ as well, representing the continuous nature of population growth.\n\nThis substitution yields the general closed-form expression for $N(t)$:\n$$N(t) = N_0 \\cdot 2^{t/\\tau}$$\nThis equation describes the number of viable cells at any time $t$, given the initial number of cells $N_0$ and the constant doubling time $\\tau$.\n\n**Part 2: Application to Estimate the Colony Count**\n\nThe problem provides the following specific values:\nInitial colony count, $N_0 = 10^3$.\nTotal incubation time, $t = 48$ hours.\nDoubling time, $\\tau = 2$ hours.\n\nWe apply these values to the derived expression for $N(t)$.\n$$N(48) = 10^3 \\cdot 2^{48/2}$$\nFirst, we calculate the exponent, which represents the number of doubling events in the given time period:\n$$\\frac{t}{\\tau} = \\frac{48}{2} = 24$$\nSo, the population will undergo $24$ doublings. The expression becomes:\n$$N(48) = 10^3 \\cdot 2^{24}$$\nNext, we must compute the value of $2^{24}$. This can be calculated as follows:\n$2^{10} = 1024$.\n$2^{24} = 2^{10} \\times 2^{10} \\times 2^4 = (1024) \\times (1024) \\times 16$.\n$(1024)^2 = 1,048,576$.\n$N(48) = 10^3 \\times (1,048,576 \\times 16)$.\n$1,048,576 \\times 16 = 16,777,216$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total colony count:\n$$N(48) = 10^3 \\times 16,777,216 = 16,777,216,000$$\nThe problem asks for the final colony count as an exact integer.

The overall population risk, $I_p$, is the weighted average of the risks in these two groups:\n$$\nI_p = (I_1 \\times p_e) + (I_0 \\times (1 - p_e))\n$$\nwhere $I_1$ is the risk in the exposed group.\n\nThe relative risk, $RR$, is defined as the ratio of the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group:\n$$\nRR = \\frac{I_1}{I_0}\n$$\nFrom this definition, we can express the risk in the exposed group, $I_1$, in terms of $RR$ and $I_0$:\n$$\nI_1 = RR \\times I_0\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $I_1$ into the equation for the population risk $I_p$:\n$$\nI_p = (RR \\times I_0 \\times p_e) + (I_0 \\times (1 - p_e))\n$$\nFactor out the common term $I_0$ from the right-hand side of the equation:\n$$\nI_p = I_0 \\left( (RR \\times p_e) + (1 - p_e) \\right)\n$$\nRearranging the terms inside the parenthesis gives:\n$$\nI_p = I_0 \\left( 1 + RR \\times p_e - p_e \\right)\n$$\n$$\nI_p = I_0 \\left( 1 + p_e(RR - 1) \\right)\n$$\nTo find the expression for PARP, we need the ratio $\\frac{I_0}{I_p}$. From the equation above, we can solve for this ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{I_p}{I_0} = 1 + p_e(RR - 1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{I_0}{I_p} = \\frac{1}{1 + p_e(RR - 1)}\n$$\nFinally, substitute this result back into the expression for PARP:\n$$\n\\text{PARP} = 1 - \\frac{I_0}{I_p} = 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + p_e(RR - 1)}\n$$\nTo combine this into a single fraction, find a common denominator:\n$$\n\\text{PARP} = \\frac{1 + p_e(RR - 1)}{1 + p_e(RR - 1)} - \\frac{1}{1 + p_e(RR - 1)}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{PARP} = \\frac{1 + p_e(RR - 1) - 1}{1 + p_e(RR - 1)}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{PARP} = \\frac{p_e(RR - 1)}{1 + p_e(RR - 1)}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the population-attributable risk proportion in terms of $p_e$ and $RR$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data: $RR = 75$ and $p_e = 0.004$.\nFirst, calculate the term $p_e(RR - 1)$:\n$$\np_e(RR - 1) = 0.004 \\times (75 - 1) = 0.004 \\times 74 = 0.296\n$$\nNext, substitute this value into the derived formula for PARP:\n$$\n\\text{PARP} = \\frac{0.296}{1 + 0.296} = \\frac{0.296}{1.296}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\n\\text{PARP} \\approx 0.2283950617...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $0.2284$. This means that approximately $22.84\\%$ of GBS cases in this population over the six-week window are attributable to recent *Campylobacter jejuni* infection.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.2284}\n$$", "id": "4632455"}]}
