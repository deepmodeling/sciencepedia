Culture-based enumeration reports a concentration of $50$ colony-forming units per liter (CFU L$^{-1}$). PMA–qPCR targeting a single-copy chromosomal gene (for example, the macrophage infectivity potentiator gene) reports $5000$ genome copies per liter (genome copies L$^{-1}$). Assume that the PMA treatment excludes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from non-viable cells, the gene target is present in $c_{g} = 1$ copy per genome, and that viable Legionella pneumophila cells in this environmental matrix carry on average $n_{g} = 2$ genome equivalents per cell due to polyploidy and growth-phase effects.

According to the problem's definition, this is calculated from the measured genome copy concentration, $C_{\\text{GC}}$, the number of gene copies per genome, $c_g$, and the average number of genome equivalents per cell, $n_g$. The formula is:\n$$C_{\\text{PMA-cell}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{GC}}}{c_g \\cdot n_g}$$\n\nThe given values are:\n- $C_{\\text{GC}} = 5000 \\text{ L}^{-1}$\n- $c_g = 1$\n- $n_g = 2$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $C_{\\text{PMA-cell}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{PMA-cell}} = \\frac{5000}{1 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{5000}{2} = 2500 \\text{ L}^{-1}$$\nThis value represents the concentration of viable cells as estimated by the molecular method.\n\nThe order-of-magnitude discrepancy, $D$, is defined as the base-$10$ logarithm of the ratio of $C_{\\text{PMA-cell}}$ to $C_{\\text{CFU}}$.\n$$D = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{C_{\\text{PMA-cell}}}{C_{\\text{CFU}}}\\right)$$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values for the concentrations:\n$$D = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{2500}{50}\\right)$$\n\nFirst, we simplify the ratio inside the logarithm:\n$$\\frac{2500}{50} = \\frac{250}{5} = 50$$\n\nSo, the discrepancy $D$ is:\n$$D = \\log_{10}(50)$$\n\nTo compute the numerical value, we can use the properties of logarithms:\n$$D = \\log_{10}(5 \\times 10) = \\log_{10}(5) + \\log_{10}(10) = \\log_{10}(5) + 1$$\nUsing a standard calculator, the value of $\\log_{10}(50)$ is approximately $1.698970004...$.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe number is $1.698970004...$. The first four significant figures are $1$, $6$, $9$, and $8$. The fifth significant figure is $9$. Since $9 \\ge 5$, we must round up the fourth significant figure.

Specificity: $\\mathbb{P}(T- \\mid \\neg D) = 0.95$.

In this specific cohort, if a patient tests positive, there is a $64.00\\%$ chance they actually have the disease. This illustrates that even with good sensitivity and specificity, a positive test result is not definitive, as $100\\% - 64.00\\% = 36.00\\%$ of positive results in this population are false positives. The test significantly increases the probability of disease from the baseline prevalence of $10\\%$ to a posterior probability of $64\\%$, but clinical judgment and potentially confirmatory testing are still required.\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of $0.9771$ is the posterior probability that a patient does not have Legionnaires' disease given a negative test result. If a patient tests negative, there is a $97.71\\%$ chance they are indeed free of the disease. The probability of having the disease despite a negative test is very low ($1 - 0.9771 = 0.0229$, or $2.29\\%$). A high NPV makes the test very useful for ruling out the disease.

This factor is defined as the ratio of the achieved free-drug pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index to a given therapeutic target value for that index.\n\nFirst, let us define the relevant quantities based on the problem statement.\nLet $AUC_{24}$ be the total plasma $24$-hour area under the concentration–time curve.\nLet $f_u$ be the unbound (free) fraction of the drug in plasma.\nLet $MIC$ be the minimal inhibitory concentration of the organism.\nLet $T$ be the conventional target value for the PK/PD index.\n\nThe fundamental principle of antimicrobial pharmacology is that only the free, unbound fraction of a drug is available to exert its effect at the site of infection. Therefore, PK/PD indices must be calculated using the free-drug concentration, not the total concentration.
