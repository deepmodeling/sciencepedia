It provides all necessary information (sensitivity, specificity, prevalence) to uniquely determine the positive predictive value.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual has multibacillary leprosy, and let $D^c$ be the event that an individual does not have the disease.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the assay returns a positive result, and let $T^-$ be the event that the assay returns a negative result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we can formalize the given information using conditional probabilities.\n\nThe prevalence of the disease is the prior probability of having the disease, $P(D)$.\n$$P(D) = 1\\% = 0.01$$\nThe probability of not having the disease is its complement.\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$$\n\nSensitivity is the probability of a positive test given that the individual has the disease. This is the true positive rate.\n$$P(T^+ | D) = 70\\% = 0.70$$\n\nSpecificity is the probability of a negative test given that the individual does not have the disease. This is the true negative rate.\n$$P(T^- | D^c) = 95\\% = 0.95$$\n\nFrom specificity, we can determine the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given that the individual does not have the disease.\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nThe problem asks for the positive predictive value (PPV), which is defined as the probability that an individual truly has the disease given a positive test result, i.e., $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T^+)$, is the probability of a true positive event (having the disease and testing positive). It can be expressed as:\n$$P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D)$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. We can expand this using the law of total probability, which states that the probability of an event can be found by summing its probabilities over a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events (in this case, $D$ and $D^c$).\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability again:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nCombining these expressions yields the formula for PPV, an application of Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this expression:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.70)(0.01)}{(0.70)(0.01) + (0.05)(0.99)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.007}{0.007 + 0.0495}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.007}{0.0565}$$\n$$PPV \\approx 0.1238938...$$\n\nRounding the result to $4$ significant figures, we get:\n$$PPV \\approx 0.1239$$\n\n**Inference on Efficiency as a Stand-Alone Screening Tool**\n\nThe calculated positive predictive value of approximately $0.1239$ means that when an individual receives a positive test result in this screening program, there is only a $12.39\\%$ probability that they actually have multibacillary leprosy. Conversely, there is an $1 - 0.1239 = 0.8761$ or $87.61\\%$ probability that the positive result is a false positive.\n\nFrom first principles, a screening tool's purpose is to efficiently and accurately identify individuals in a large, often asymptomatic population who are likely to have a disease, thereby warranting further, more definitive diagnostic assessment. For a test to be considered efficient as a *stand-alone* tool, a positive result should carry a high probability of being correct.\n\nIn this case, for every $100$ individuals who test positive, approximately $88$ will be disease-free ($P(D^c | T^+) = 1 - PPV$). Using this test as a stand-alone tool would lead to the misclassification of a very large number of healthy people as potentially diseased. This has several major negative consequences:\n$1$. It leads to immense resource inefficiency. The vast majority of resources allocated for follow-up (confirmatory tests, clinical consultations) would be spent on individuals who do not have the disease.\n$2$. It causes significant unnecessary anxiety, psychological distress, and social stigma for the large number of individuals receiving false positive results.\n$3$. It erodes trust in the public health system.\n\nTherefore, because the probability of a positive test being a true positive is very low ($12.39\\%$), this assay is highly inefficient as a stand-alone community screening tool in a population with a $1\\%$ prevalence. The low PPV is a direct mathematical consequence of applying a test with imperfect specificity to a population with low disease prevalence. Even a high specificity like $95\\%$ yields a substantial number of false positives when the number of non-diseased individuals ($99\\%$ of the population) is much larger than the number of diseased individuals ($1\\%$ of the population). The test would be more appropriately used as part of a multi-stage screening or diagnostic algorithm, not as a stand-alone determinant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1239}$$", "id": "4655789"}, {"introduction": "Once a patient is suspected of having leprosy, the next step is to confirm the diagnosis and classify the disease to guide therapy.

Classification is based on the number of skin lesions, with patients classified as multibacillary if they have more than a threshold number of lesions. This operational classifier has known performance characteristics: sensitivity is the probability that a truly multibacillary patient is correctly identified as multibacillary, and specificity is the probability that a truly paucibacillary patient is correctly identified as paucibacillary. Paucibacillary and multibacillary forms receive different multidrug therapy (MDT) regimens, with longer duration and an additional drug for multibacillary disease. Misclassification induces undertreatment of multibacillary patients and overtreatment of paucibacillary patients, with distinct effects on relapse and adverse events.\n\nConsider a cohort of $N=1000$ newly diagnosed, previously untreated patients in a district where the prevalence of multibacillary disease among new cases is $p_{\\mathrm{MB}}=0.4$.
