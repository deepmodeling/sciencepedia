It provides a standard scenario in medical statistics, and all required data and definitions are present and consistent. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has a true dermatophyte infection, and let $D^c$ be the complement event, where the patient does not have the infection. Let $p$ be the prevalence of the infection, which is defined as the prior probability of having the disease, $p = P(D)$. Consequently, the probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - p$.\n\nLet $T^+$ denote a positive test result and $T^-$ denote a negative test result. The core operating characteristics of a diagnostic test are its sensitivity ($Se$) and specificity ($Sp$), defined as follows:\nSensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present: $Se = P(T^+ | D)$.\nSpecificity is the probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent: $Sp = P(T^- | D^c)$.\n\nA test result is correct under two mutually exclusive conditions:\n1.  A **true positive**, where the patient has the disease and the test is positive. The joint probability of this event is $P(T^+ \\cap D)$.\n2.  A **true negative**, where the patient does not have the disease and the test is negative. The joint probability of this event is $P(T^- \\cap D^c)$.\n\nThe expected probability that a test result is correct, denoted as $P(\\text{Correct})$, is the sum of the probabilities of these two events. This is an application of the law of total probability, partitioning the event \"Correct\" by the disease status of the patient.\n$$P(\\text{Correct}) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^- \\cap D^c)$$\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can express these joint probabilities in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence.\nThe probability of a true positive is:\n$$P(T^+ \\cap D) = P(T^+ | D) \\cdot P(D) = Se \\cdot p$$\nThe probability of a true negative is:\n$$P(T^- \\cap D^c) = P(T^- | D^c) \\cdot P(D^c) = Sp \\cdot (1 - p)$$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(\\text{Correct})$ yields the general formula for the expected probability of a correct classification:\n$$P(\\text{Correct}) = p \\cdot Se + (1 - p) \\cdot Sp$$\n\nThis expression is the first part of the required derivation. Now, we apply this formula to the two diagnostic tests: KOH microscopy and fungal culture.

Assume contacts occur as a time-homogeneous process with independent transmission events and that the expectation of secondary cases equals the sum of per-contact risks across the infectious period in a fully susceptible population.\n\nIn this setting, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ (the expected number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual introduced into a fully susceptible population) can be derived from first principles using these assumptions.

A solution will be formulated.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem asks for the derivation and calculation of the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and the critical control threshold, $f_c$.\n\n**1. Derivation of $R_0$**\n\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. The problem specifies a simple mechanistic model for its derivation.\n\n- The mean number of contacts an infectious individual makes per day is $c$.\n- The probability of transmission upon any given contact with a susceptible person is $\\beta$.\n- Since the population is assumed to be fully susceptible, every contact is with a susceptible person.\n- Therefore, the expected number of new infections generated per day by one infectious individual is the product of the contact rate and the transmission probability per contact: $\\beta c$.\n- The infectious period lasts for $T$ days, and the process is assumed to be time-homogeneous (the rate of generating new infections is constant over this period).\n- The total expected number of secondary infections over the entire infectious period is the rate of infection per day multiplied by the duration of the infectious period.\n\nThis leads to the expression for the basic reproduction number:\n$$R_0 = \\beta c T$$\n\n**2. Numerical Evaluation of $R_0$**\n\nThe problem provides the following values: $\\beta = 0.05$, $c = 20$, and $T = 30$. Substituting these into the expression for $R_0$:\n$$R_0 = (0.05) \\times (20) \\times (30)$$\n$$R_0 = 1 \\times 30 = 30$$\nThe basic reproduction number is $30$. This means that, on average, one infected wrestler is expected to infect $30$ other wrestlers in this fully susceptible, uncontrolled setting.\n\n**3. Derivation of $f_c$**\n\nThe controlled reproduction number, $R_c$, is given by $R_c = (1-f)R_0$, where $f$ is the fraction of transmission events blocked by control measures. For an epidemic to be controlled and eventually die out, the reproduction number must be brought down to a value less than or equal to $1$.\n\nThe critical control threshold, $f_c$, is the minimum fraction of transmission that must be blocked to achieve $R_c \\le 1$. We find this minimum by setting $R_c$ to its threshold value of $1$:\n$$R_c = (1-f_c)R_0 = 1$$\nWe now solve this equation for $f_c$:\n$$1 - f_c = \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n$$f_c = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\nThis expression gives the critical control threshold in terms of the basic reproduction number.\n\n**4. Numerical Evaluation of $f_c$**\n\nUsing the previously calculated value $R_0 = 30$:\n$$f_c = 1 - \\frac{1}{30}$$\n$$f_c = \\frac{30}{30} - \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{29}{30}$$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we convert this fraction to a decimal:\n$$f_c = 0.966666...$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$f_c \\approx 0.9667$$\nThis means that at least $96.67\\%$ of transmission events must be blocked to control the outbreak.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9667}$$", "id": "4637879"}]}
