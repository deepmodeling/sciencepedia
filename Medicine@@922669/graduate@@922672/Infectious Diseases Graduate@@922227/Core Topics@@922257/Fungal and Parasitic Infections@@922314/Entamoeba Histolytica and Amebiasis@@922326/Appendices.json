This exercise challenges you to evaluate a stool antigen test for *Entamoeba histolytica* by deriving and calculating its positive predictive value ($PPV$). This practice is crucial for understanding how a test's performance in the real world is critically dependent not only on its intrinsic sensitivity and specificity but also on the prevalence of the disease in the population being tested.", "problem": "A referral center in an endemic region is validating a stool antigen enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for detection of Entamoeba histolytica in adults presenting with acute dysentery. In this clinically enriched cohort, epidemiologic surveillance estimates the point prevalence of invasive Entamoeba histolytica infection to be $p=0.15$. Against a composite reference standard, the assay’s sensitivity is $Se=0.92$ and specificity is $Sp=0.95$. Using only the core definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, the law of total probability, and Bayes’ theorem, derive the expression for the positive predictive value (PPV) as $P(D \\mid T^{+})$, where $D$ denotes true infection and $T^{+}$ denotes a positive antigen test, and then compute its numerical value for this subpopulation. Express your final answer as an exact fraction. Do not use a percentage sign. No units are required.", "solution": "The task is to derive the expression for the positive predictive value, $PPV$, and compute its numerical value. The positive predictive value is the probability that a subject has the disease given a positive test result. This is denoted by the conditional probability $P(D \\mid T^{+})$, where $D$ represents the event of having the disease (true infection) and $T^{+}$ represents the event of a positive test result.\n\nThe given quantities are:\n1.  The prevalence of the disease, $P(D) = p = 0.15$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test, $Se = P(T^{+} \\mid D) = 0.92$. This is the probability of a positive test given the subject has the disease.\n3.  The specificity of the test, $Sp = P(T^{-} \\mid D^{c}) = 0.95$. This is the probability of a negative test given the subject does not have the disease, where $D^{c}$ is the complement of $D$ (no disease) and $T^{-}$ is the event of a negative test.\n\nThe derivation begins with Bayes' theorem, which defines the posterior probability $P(D \\mid T^{+})$:\n$$P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^{+})}$$\nIn this expression, we are given $P(T^{+} \\mid D)$ (the sensitivity, $Se$) and $P(D)$ (the prevalence, $p$). The term in the denominator, $P(T^{+})$, is the overall probability of a positive test in the population. This probability must be calculated using the law of total probability. The population can be partitioned into two disjoint sets: subjects with the disease ($D$) and subjects without the disease ($D^{c}$).\n\nAccording to the law of total probability, $P(T^{+})$ can be expressed as:\n$$P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\mid D) P(D) + P(T^{+} \\mid D^{c}) P(D^{c})$$\nWe need to determine the terms on the right-hand side.\n- $P(T^{+} \\mid D)$ is the sensitivity, $Se$.\n- $P(D)$ is the prevalence, $p$.\n- $P(D^{c})$ is the probability of not having the disease, which is $1 - P(D) = 1 - p$.\n- $P(T^{+} \\mid D^{c})$ is the probability of a positive test in a subject without the disease, also known as the false positive rate. This can be derived from the specificity, $Sp$. Since a test result can only be positive ($T^{+}$) or negative ($T^{-}$), for a subject without the disease, the sum of probabilities is $1$:\n$$P(T^{+} \\mid D^{c}) + P(T^{-} \\mid D^{c}) = 1$$\nThus, $P(T^{+} \\mid D^{c}) = 1 - P(T^{-} \\mid D^{c}) = 1 - Sp$.\n\nSubstituting these definitions into the expression for $P(T^{+})$:\n$$P(T^{+}) = (Se \\cdot p) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - p))$$\n\nNow we substitute this expanded form of $P(T^{+})$ back into the Bayes' theorem formula for $P(D \\mid T^{+})$:\n$$P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid D) P(D)}{(Se \\cdot p) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - p))}$$\nUsing the symbolic representations, we arrive at the final derived expression for the positive predictive value:\n$$PPV = P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}$$\nThis completes the derivation as requested.\n\nThe next step is to compute the numerical value using the provided data: $p = 0.15$, $Se = 0.92$, and $Sp = 0.95$.\n- $1 - p = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$\n- $1 - Sp = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$\n\nSubstitute these values into the derived formula:\n$$P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{0.92 \\cdot 0.15}{0.92 \\cdot 0.15 + (0.05) \\cdot (0.85)}$$\nCalculate the products:\n- Numerator: $0.92 \\cdot 0.15 = 0.138$\n- Denominator, second term: $0.05 \\cdot 0.85 = 0.0425$\n\nSubstitute these intermediate results back into the equation:\n$$P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{0.138}{0.138 + 0.0425} = \\frac{0.138}{0.1805}$$\n\nTo express this result as an exact fraction, we can remove the decimals by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by $10000$:\n$$P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{0.138 \\times 10000}{0.1805 \\times 10000} = \\frac{1380}{1805}$$\n\nNow, we simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor. Both numbers are divisible by $5$:\n$$1380 \\div 5 = 276$$\n$$1805 \\div 5 = 361$$\nSo the fraction simplifies to:\n$$P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{276}{361}$$\nTo check if this fraction can be simplified further, we can find the prime factors of the numerator and denominator. The denominator is $361 = 19^2$. We check if the numerator, $276$, is divisible by $19$.\n$$276 \\div 19 = 14.526...$$\nSince $276$ is not divisible by $19$, the fraction $\\frac{276}{361}$ is in its simplest form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{276}{361}}$$", "id": "4641480"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of diagnostic accuracy, this problem addresses a common challenge in epidemiology: estimating the true incidence of a disease from surveillance data collected with imperfect tests. You will derive a formula to correct the observed incidence of amebic colitis for misclassification errors, a method essential for accurate public health monitoring and resource allocation. This practice demonstrates how to move from interpreting an individual test result to assessing disease burden at the population level.", "problem": "A rural clinic conducts surveillance for amebic colitis caused by Entamoeba histolytica using a stool antigen capture assay. Microscopic examination cannot reliably distinguish Entamoeba histolytica from Entamoeba dispar, and cross-reactivity can produce false positives in individuals colonized with Entamoeba dispar. The antigen capture assay has constant sensitivity $Se$ and specificity $Sp$ for detecting true amebic colitis due to Entamoeba histolytica, as validated against a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reference.\n\nIn a closed cohort monitored over a fixed surveillance interval, everyone is tested once during the interval, and the crude test-positive proportion is recorded. Let $r_{\\text{obs}}$ denote the observed fraction testing positive during the interval.

Let $T^+$ be the event that this individual tests positive with the antigen capture assay. The complementary events are $D^c$ (no disease) and $T^-$ (negative test).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we define the given quantities in terms of probabilities:\n- The true incidence proportion is the probability of having the disease: $I_{\\text{true}} = P(D)$.\n- The observed fraction testing positive is the probability of a positive test: $r_{\\text{obs}} = P(T^+)$.\n- The sensitivity ($Se$) is the conditional probability of a positive test given the presence of disease: $Se = P(T^+ | D)$.\n- The specificity ($Sp$) is the conditional probability of a negative test given the absence of disease: $Sp = P(T^- | D^c)$.\n\nOur derivation will use the law of total probability, which is a fundamental component of Bayes' theorem. The overall probability of an event (in this case, a positive test) can be found by summing its probabilities conditioned on a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events (in this case, having the disease or not having the disease).\n\nThe probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$, can be expressed as:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D)P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c)P(D^c)$$\n\nWe can now substitute the defined terms into this equation. We have $P(T^+) = r_{\\text{obs}}$, $P(D) = I_{\\text{true}}$, and $P(T^+ | D) = Se$. We must also express the terms $P(D^c)$ and $P(T^+ | D^c)$ using the given information.\n\nThe probability of not having the disease is the complement of having the disease:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - I_{\\text{true}}$$\n\nThe term $P(T^+ | D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given the absence of disease, which is the false positive rate. It can be derived from the specificity, $Sp$. Since a non-diseased individual must either test positive or negative, the probabilities must sum to $1$:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) + P(T^- | D^c) = 1$$\nSubstituting $Sp = P(T^- | D^c)$, we get:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - Sp$$\n\nNow, we substitute all these expressions back into the law of total probability equation:\n$$r_{\\text{obs}} = (Se)(I_{\\text{true}}) + (1 - Sp)(1 - I_{\\text{true}})$$\n\nThis equation provides a relationship between the observed quantity $r_{\\text{obs}}$ and the quantity of interest $I_{\\text{true}}$. The next step is to algebraically solve for $I_{\\text{true}}$.\nFirst, we expand the right-hand side of the equation:\n$$r_{\\text{obs}} = Se \\cdot I_{\\text{true}} + 1 - Sp - (1 - Sp) \\cdot I_{\\text{true}}$$\n\nNext, we collect all terms involving $I_{\\text{true}}$ on one side of the equation:\n$$r_{\\text{obs}} - (1 - Sp) = Se \\cdot I_{\\text{true}} - (1 - Sp) \\cdot I_{\\text{true}}$$\n$$r_{\\text{obs}} - 1 + Sp = I_{\\text{true}} (Se - (1 - Sp))$$\n$$r_{\\text{obs}} + Sp - 1 = I_{\\text{true}} (Se + Sp - 1)$$\n\nFinally, we isolate $I_{\\text{true}}$ by dividing by its coefficient:\n$$I_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{r_{\\text{obs}} + Sp - 1}{Se + Sp - 1}$$\n\nThis is the desired closed-form expression for the true incidence proportion. This formula is commonly known in epidemiology as the Rogan-Gladen estimator.\n\nThe primary assumption required for this expression to be valid and meaningful is that the denominator is non-zero, i.e., $Se + Sp - 1 \\neq 0$. If $Se + Sp = 1$, the test is non-informative (its positive likelihood ratio is $1$), meaning it performs no better than random chance, and thus the true incidence cannot be determined from the observed test results.
