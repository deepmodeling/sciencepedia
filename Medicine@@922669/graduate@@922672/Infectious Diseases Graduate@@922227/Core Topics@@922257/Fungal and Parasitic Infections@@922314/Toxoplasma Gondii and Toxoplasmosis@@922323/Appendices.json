The single-hit model, which leads to the exponential dose-response function, is a fundamental and widely used model for pathogen infectivity. It is scientifically sound.\n    -   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters ($D$, $r$), a clear distributional assumption (Poisson), and a precise definition of the event of interest (infection). This allows for the derivation of a unique, meaningful solution.\n    -   **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, formal language, free of bias or subjective claims.\n\n3.  **Verdict**: The problem is valid. It is a standard application of probability theory to infectious disease modeling.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the number of initiating events that occur within the host following the exposure. According to the problem statement, $X$ follows a Poisson distribution, which we can write as $X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean number of initiating events.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for a Poisson-distributed random variable $X$ is given by:\n$$P(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nfor $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n\nThe problem states that the mean number of initiating events, $\\lambda$, is proportional to the ingested dose $D$ via the per-oocyst initiating rate parameter $r$. Therefore, the mean of the distribution is:\n$$\\lambda = rD$$\n\nSubstituting this into the PMF, we get:\n$$P(X=k) = \\frac{(rD)^k \\exp(-rD)}{k!}$$\n\nInfection is defined as the occurrence of at least one initiating event. This corresponds to the event $X \\ge 1$. The probability of infection, denoted as $P_{\\text{inf}}$, is therefore $P(X \\ge 1)$. It is more straightforward to calculate this probability by considering the complement event, which is the occurrence of zero initiating events, $X=0$.\n$$P_{\\text{inf}} = P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X < 1) = 1 - P(X=0)$$\nThe equality $P(X < 1) = P(X = 0)$ holds because the number of events $X$ must be a non-negative integer.\n\nWe calculate $P(X=0)$ by setting $k=0$ in the PMF:\n$$P(X=0) = \\frac{(rD)^0 \\exp(-rD)}{0!}$$\nBy definition, any non-zero number raised to the power of $0$ is $1$, and factorial of $0$ is $1$ (i.e., $(rD)^0=1$ for $rD \\neq 0$, and $0!=1$). Thus, the expression simplifies to:\n$$P(X=0) = \\exp(-rD)$$\n\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the infection probability, we obtain the general closed-form expression for the infection probability as a function of $r$ and $D$:\n$$P_{\\text{inf}}(r, D) = 1 - \\exp(-rD)$$\nThis is known as the exponential dose-response model.\n\nNow, we compute the specific infection probability for the given values:\n- Dose $D = 100$ oocysts\n- Rate parameter $r = 0.02$\n\nFirst, we calculate the mean number of initiating events, $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = rD = 0.02 \\times 100 = 2$$\n\nNext, we substitute this value into the probability formula:\n$$P_{\\text{inf}} = 1 - \\exp(-2)$$\n\nTo obtain the numerical value, we calculate $\\exp(-2)$:\n$$\\exp(-2) \\approx 0.13533528...$$\nThen, the probability of infection is:\n$$P_{\\text{inf}} \\approx 1 - 0.13533528 = 0.86466472...$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures as requested gives:\n$$P_{\\text{inf}} \\approx 0.8647$$\n\n**Biological Interpretation**\n\nThe computed probability of approximately $0.8647$ signifies a high risk of infection. It implies that a single oral exposure to $100$ *Toxoplasma gondii* oocysts is expected to result in infection in approximately $86.5\\%$ of such cases, according to this model. This demonstrates that while the probability of any single oocyst initiating infection is low (given by $r=0.02$), the cumulative risk from a dose of $100$ oocysts becomes substantial. The non-linear nature of the dose-response relationship means that the probability of at least one success among many independent trials can be high, even if the individual success probability is small. This result underscores the high infectivity potential of *T. gondii* and the public health importance of avoiding exposure to contaminated materials.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8647}$$", "id": "4700389"}, {"introduction": "Clinical decision-making for diseases like toxoplasmosis is rarely black and white; it is an exercise in managing uncertainty.
