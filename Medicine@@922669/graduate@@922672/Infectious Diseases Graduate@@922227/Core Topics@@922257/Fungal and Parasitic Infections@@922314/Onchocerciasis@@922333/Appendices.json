The Annual Biting Rate (ABR) is defined as the expected total number of bites a single person receives over a calendar year. Consider a human landing catch (HLC) protocol in which a single trained collector samples bites from sunrise to sunset on selected calendar days by aspirating every blackfly that lands on his or her exposed lower legs. Assume the following foundational facts are valid for this system: (i) blackfly biting activity occurs during daylight with negligible nocturnal biting, (ii) the calendar has $365$ days, and (iii) the total bites recorded in an HLC day equal the total bites that would have been received by one person during that daylight period.\n\nSuppose $n$ calendar days are selected uniformly at random without replacement across the year, and the HLC procedure is performed on each selected day from sunrise to sunset. Let $B_{d}$ denote the random number of bites that one person would receive on calendar day $d$ during daylight, and let $D$ be a day selected uniformly at random from $\\{1,2,\\ldots,365\\}$. You may assume that the HLC measurement for a sampled day is an unbiased observation of $B_{d}$.\n\nStarting only from the definition of the Annual Biting Rate as the expected cumulative bites over a year and standard rules of expectation, derive an estimator for the Annual Biting Rate using $n$ independent HLC daily counts drawn uniformly over the calendar and justify the sampling assumptions under which your estimator is unbiased and consistent. Then, for $n=20$ sampled days, use the following observed HLC daily bite counts (in bites per person per day): $50, 62, 41, 55, 43, 60, 49, 58, 47, 52, 57, 63, 46, 51, 54, 59, 48, 53, 56, 45$ to compute the Annual Biting Rate. Express your final answer in bites per person per year, and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an estimator for the Annual Biting Rate (ABR), justification of its statistical properties, and its application to a given dataset.\n\nFirst, we formalize the quantity to be estimated. The Annual Biting Rate (ABR) is defined as the total number of bites a single person receives over a calendar year. Let the year consist of $N=365$ days, indexed by $d \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 365\\}$. Let $b_d$ be the true, fixed number of bites a person receives on day $d$. The ABR for the specific year in question is the total sum of these daily counts:\n$$\n\\mathcal{B} = \\sum_{d=1}^{365} b_d\n$$\nThis is the parameter we wish to estimate.\n\nWe can express $\\mathcal{B}$ in terms of the mean daily bite count for the year, $\\mu_B$. The population mean $\\mu_B$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\mu_B = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{d=1}^{N} b_d = \\frac{1}{365} \\sum_{d=1}^{365} b_d\n$$\nThus, the ABR can be written as $\\mathcal{B} = 365 \\mu_B$. Estimating the ABR is equivalent to estimating the mean daily bite rate $\\mu_B$ and scaling it by $365$.\n\nThe problem states that $n$ calendar days are selected uniformly at random without replacement. Let the observed HLC daily bite counts for these $n$ days be denoted by the set of measurements $\\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\}$. Each $x_i$ corresponds to the bite count $b_{d_i}$ on a sampled day $d_i$. The problem states that the HLC measurement is an unbiased observation; we interpret this in the simplest form, that the measurement is exact, so $x_i = b_{d_i}$.\n\nA natural estimator for the population mean $\\mu_B$ is the sample mean, $\\hat{\\mu}_B$, calculated from the $n$ observations:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mu}_B = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\n$$\nFollowing this, the estimator for the Annual Biting Rate, which we denote as $\\widehat{\\mathcal{B}}$, is:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathcal{B}} = 365 \\times \\hat{\\mu}_B = 365 \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\right)\n$$\n\nWe must now justify the sampling assumptions under which this estimator is unbiased and consistent.\n\n**Unbiasedness**\nAn estimator is unbiased if its expected value is equal to the true parameter value. The key assumption for unbiasedness is that the sample is a simple random sample from the population. In this case, the $n$ days are selected uniformly at random without replacement from the $N=365$ days of the year. Let $X_i$ be the random variable representing the bite count from the $i$-th draw. Due to the nature of simple random sampling, the marginal probability distribution of $X_i$ for any $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ is identical to the distribution of a single draw from the entire population. Therefore, the expectation of any single observation is the population mean:\n$$\nE[X_i] = \\mu_B = \\frac{1}{365} \\sum_{d=1}^{365} b_d\n$$\nNow, let us find the expectation of our estimator $\\widehat{\\mathcal{B}}$:\n$$\nE[\\widehat{\\mathcal{B}}] = E\\left[ 365 \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \\right) \\right]\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation:\n$$\nE[\\widehat{\\mathcal{B}}] = \\frac{365}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i] = \\frac{365}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mu_B = \\frac{365}{n} (n \\mu_B) = 365 \\mu_B\n$$\nSince $\\mathcal{B} = 365 \\mu_B$, we have shown that $E[\\widehat{\\mathcal{B}}] = \\mathcal{B}$. The estimator is unbiased under the assumption of simple random sampling and accurate HLC measurements.\n\n**Consistency**\nAn estimator is consistent if it converges in probability to the true parameter value as the sample size increases. For a finite population of size $N$, this means the estimator approaches the true value as $n \\to N$. This property is established by showing that the variance of the estimator approaches $0$ as $n \\to N$.\n\nThe variance of the sample mean $\\hat{\\mu}_B$ for a simple random sample of size $n$ drawn without replacement from a finite population of size $N$ is given by:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}_B) = \\frac{S^2}{n} \\left( 1 - \\frac{n}{N} \\right) = \\frac{S^2}{n} \\left( \\frac{N-n}{N} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $S^2 = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{d=1}^{N} (b_d - \\mu_B)^2$ is the (unbiased) population variance. The term $\\left(1 - \\frac{n}{N}\\right)$ is the finite population correction factor.\n\nThe variance of our ABR estimator $\\widehat{\\mathcal{B}} = 365 \\hat{\\mu}_B = N \\hat{\\mu}_B$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\widehat{\\mathcal{B}}) = \\text{Var}(N \\hat{\\mu}_B) = N^2 \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}_B) = N^2 \\frac{S^2}{n} \\left( \\frac{N-n}{N} \\right) = N S^2 \\frac{N-n}{n}\n$$\nIn our specific case, $N=365$. So,\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\widehat{\\mathcal{B}}) = 365 S^2 \\frac{365-n}{n}\n$$\nAs the sample size $n$ approaches the population size $N=365$, the numerator $(365-n)$ approaches $0$. Consequently, $\\text{Var}(\\widehat{\\mathcal{B}}) \\to 0$. When $n=365$, the variance is $0$, and our estimate is exact. By Chebyshev's inequality, since the variance converges to $0$, the estimator $\\widehat{\\mathcal{B}}$ converges in probability to its mean, which we have shown to be the true ABR, $\\mathcal{B}$. Therefore, the estimator is consistent.\n\nThe problem text mentions \"$n$ independent HLC daily counts\". Observations drawn without replacement from a finite population are not strictly independent. However, this phrasing is often used when the sample size $n$ is much smaller than the population size $N$, in which case the dependence is weak and the observations can be approximated as independent and identically distributed. Our derivation using the finite population sampling framework is more rigorous and directly accounts for the \"without replacement\" sampling scheme.\n\n**Calculation**\nWe are given $n=20$ HLC daily bite counts: $50, 62, 41, 55, 43, 60, 49, 58, 47, 52, 57, 63, 46, 51, 54, 59, 48, 53, 56, 45$.\n\nFirst, we compute the sum of these observations:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{20} x_i = 50 + 62 + 41 + 55 + 43 + 60 + 49 + 58 + 47 + 52 + 57 + 63 + 46 + 51 + 54 + 59 + 48 + 53 + 56 + 45 = 1049\n$$\nNext, we compute the sample mean daily bite rate, $\\hat{\\mu}_B$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mu}_B = \\frac{1}{20} \\sum_{i=1}^{20} x_i = \\frac{1049}{20} = 52.45 \\text{ bites/day}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the estimate for the Annual Biting Rate, $\\widehat{\\mathcal{B}}$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathcal{B}} = 365 \\times \\hat{\\mu}_B = 365 \\times 52.45 = 19144.25\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $19144.25$ has leading digits $1, 9, 1, 4$. The fifth digit is $4$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathcal{B}} \\approx 19140\n$$\nTo express this value unambiguously with four significant figures, we use scientific notation: $1.914 \\times 10^4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.914 \\times 10^{4}}\n$$", "id": "4675411"}, {"introduction": "With a reliable measure of transmission intensity, we can then set a clear target for control efforts.

The basic reproduction number ($R_0$) is defined as the expected number of secondary infections generated by a single infection in a fully susceptible population, and elimination is ensured when $R_0 < 1$. Under fixed entomological and parasitological conditions (for example, constant vector competence, parasite establishment probability, and no change in human microfilarial density due to recent interventions), well-tested transmission theory for vector-borne infections supports that $R_0$ scales proportionally with $ABR$, i.e., $R_0$ is linear in $ABR$.\n\nSuppose a hyperendemic focus has a measured Annual Biting Rate $ABR_0 = 37{,}500$ bites per person per year and a current basic reproduction number $R_0$ equal to $2.7$.

This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$R_0 = k \\cdot ABR$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality. This constant amalgamates all other factors affecting transmission, which are assumed to be fixed.\n\nWe are given a specific state for a hyperendemic focus: an initial $R_0$ of $2.7$ corresponding to an initial $ABR_0$ of $37{,}500$ bites per person per year. We can use this data point to determine the value of the proportionality constant $k$:\n$$2.7 = k \\cdot 37{,}500$$\n$$k = \\frac{2.7}{37{,}500} \\, \\text{year} \\cdot \\text{person} \\cdot \\text{bite}^{-1}$$\nThe problem asks for the critical Annual Biting Rate, $ABR_{\\text{crit}}$, which is the threshold ABR at which elimination is ensured. This threshold corresponds to the point where the basic reproduction number is equal to $1$. Setting $R_0 = 1$ in our proportionality equation:\n$$1 = k \\cdot ABR_{\\text{crit}}$$\nWe can solve for $ABR_{\\text{crit}}$ by substituting the expression for $k$ we found, or more directly by setting up a ratio. From the proportionality, we have:\n$$\\frac{R_0}{ABR} = k = \\text{constant}$$\nTherefore, the ratio must be the same for the initial state and the critical threshold state:\n$$\\frac{2.7}{ABR_0} = \\frac{1}{ABR_{\\text{crit}}}$$\nSubstituting the value $ABR_0 = 37{,}500$:\n$$\\frac{2.7}{37{,}500} = \\frac{1}{ABR_{\\text{crit}}}$$\nSolving for $ABR_{\\text{crit}}$:\n$$ABR_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{37{,}500}{2.7} \\approx 13888.88... \\, \\text{bites per person per year}$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ABR_{\\text{crit}} \\approx 13890 \\, \\text{bites per person per year}$$\nTo express this with four significant figures unambiguously, scientific notation is appropriate: $1.389 \\times 10^4$.\n\n### Robustness Analysis of the Linear Scaling Assumption\n\nWe now evaluate the effect of a small nonlinearity. The proposed alternative model is $R_0(ABR) = \\beta \\, ABR^{1+\\epsilon}$, where $|\\epsilon| \\ll 1$.\n\nFirst, we calibrate the constant $\\beta$ using the initial condition, which we denote as $(ABR_0, R_{0,0})$ where $ABR_0 = 37,500$ and $R_{0,0} = 2.7$:\n$$R_{0,0} = \\beta \\cdot (ABR_0)^{1+\\epsilon}$$\nNext, we define the new critical biting rate, $ABR'_{\\text{crit}}$, as the rate where $R_0=1$ under this nonlinear model:\n$$1 = \\beta \\cdot (ABR'_{\\text{crit}})^{1+\\epsilon}$$\nTo find $ABR'_{\\text{crit}}$, we can eliminate the unknown constant $\\beta$ by dividing the first equation by the second:\n$$\\frac{R_{0,0}}{1} = \\frac{\\beta \\cdot (ABR_0)^{1+\\epsilon}}{\\beta \\cdot (ABR'_{\\text{crit}})^{1+\\epsilon}} = \\left(\\frac{ABR_0}{ABR'_{\\text{crit}}}\\right)^{1+\\epsilon}$$\nSolving for $ABR'_{\\text{crit}}$:\n$$ABR'_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{ABR_0}{(R_{0,0})^{\\frac{1}{1+\\epsilon}}}$$\nWe wish to find the multiplicative correction to the linear-case result, $ABR_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{ABR_0}{R_{0,0}}$. Let's rewrite the expression for $ABR'_{\\text{crit}}$ in terms of $ABR_{\\text{crit}}$:\n$$ABR'_{\\text{crit}} = \\left(\\frac{ABR_0}{R_{0,0}}\\right) \\cdot R_{0,0} \\cdot (R_{0,0})^{-\\frac{1}{1+\\epsilon}} = ABR_{\\text{crit}} \\cdot (R_{0,0})^{1 - \\frac{1}{1+\\epsilon}}$$\nThe multiplicative correction factor is $(R_{0,0})^{1 - \\frac{1}{1+\\epsilon}}$. We need to approximate this to first order in $\\epsilon$. We use the Taylor expansion for the exponent. For small $|\\epsilon|$, the geometric series approximation gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{1+\\epsilon} \\approx 1 - \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$$\nSubstituting this into the exponent of the correction factor:\n$$1 - \\frac{1}{1+\\epsilon} \\approx 1 - (1 - \\epsilon) = \\epsilon$$\nSo, the correction factor is approximately $(R_{0,0})^{\\epsilon}$.\nNow, we perform another first-order Taylor expansion, this time for the exponential function $a^x = \\exp(x\\ln a) \\approx 1 + x\\ln a$ for small $x$. Here, $x=\\epsilon$ and $a=R_{0,0}$.\n$$(R_{0,0})^{\\epsilon} \\approx 1 + \\epsilon \\ln(R_{0,0})$$\nTherefore, the relationship between the nonlinear and linear critical values is, to first order in $\\epsilon$:\n$$ABR'_{\\text{crit}} \\approx ABR_{\\text{crit}} \\, (1 + \\epsilon \\ln(R_{0,0}))$$\nSubstituting $R_{0,0} = 2.7$:\n$$ABR'_{\\text{crit}} \\approx ABR_{\\text{crit}} \\, (1 + \\epsilon \\ln(2.7))$$\nThe multiplicative correction to $ABR_{\\text{crit}}$ is the factor $(1 + \\epsilon \\ln(2.7))$. This shows that if the true relationship is slightly super-linear ($\\epsilon>0$), the required critical ABR is higher than predicted by the linear model. Conversely, if it is sub-linear ($\\epsilon<0$), the required critical ABR is lower.\n\nThe final numerical answer requested, however, is solely the value derived from the primary linear model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.389 \\times 10^4}$$", "id": "4675350"}, {"introduction": "Effective interventions like mass drug administration (MDA) are not without risks, especially in complex epidemiological settings.
