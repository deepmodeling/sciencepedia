It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique, meaningful solution. The provided parameters for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence are plausible for an epidemiological study of hydatid disease.\n\nThe task is to derive the expression for the positive predictive value (PPV) and calculate its numerical value based on the provided data. The PPV is the probability that an individual with a positive test result truly has the disease. We will use the foundational definitions from probability theory and epidemiology.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $D$: The event that a randomly selected individual from the population has active hydatid disease.\n- $D^c$: The event that a randomly selected individual does not have active hydatid disease.\n- $T^+$: The event that the ELISA test result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the ELISA test result is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following probabilities:\n1.  The prevalence of the disease, $\\pi$, is the prior probability of having the disease:\n    $$P(D) = \\pi = 0.10$$\n    Consequently, the probability of not having the disease is:\n    $$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\pi = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$$\n\n2.  The sensitivity of the test, $\\mathrm{Se}$, is the conditional probability of a positive test result given that the individual has the disease. This is the true positive rate.\n    $$\\mathrm{Se} = P(T^+ | D) = 0.85$$\n\n3.  The specificity of the test, $\\mathrm{Sp}$, is the conditional probability of a negative test result given that the individual does not have the disease. This is the true negative rate.\n    $$\\mathrm{Sp} = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.90$$\n\nFrom the definition of specificity, we can determine the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual does not have the disease.\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - \\mathrm{Sp} = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\n\nThe quantity we are required to find is the positive predictive value, $\\mathrm{PPV}$. The $\\mathrm{PPV}$ is the posterior probability that an individual has the disease given that their test result is positive. This is expressed as the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem to derive the expression for $\\mathrm{PPV}$:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result, which can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: a true positive (the person has the disease and tests positive) or a false positive (the person does not have the disease but tests positive). Using the law of total probability, we can express $P(T^+)$ as:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, this becomes:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expanded expression for $P(T^+)$ back into the Bayes' theorem formula for $P(D | T^+)$:\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}$$\n\nThis is the general derivation of the $\\mathrm{PPV}$ from first principles. We can now express this formula using the standard epidemiological terms provided in the problem statement: $\\mathrm{Se}$, $\\mathrm{Sp}$, and $\\pi$.\n- $P(D) = \\pi$\n- $P(D^c) = 1 - \\pi$\n- $P(T^+|D) = \\mathrm{Se}$\n- $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - \\mathrm{Sp}$\n\nSubstituting these into the derived expression gives the formula for $\\mathrm{PPV}$ in terms of the given parameters:\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi}{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp}) \\cdot (1 - \\pi)}$$\n\nThis is the required analytical expression. The final step is to compute the numerical value by substituting the given values: $\\mathrm{Se} = 0.85$, $\\mathrm{Sp} = 0.90$, and $\\pi = 0.10$.\n\nThe numerator is the probability of a true positive result in the population:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = \\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi = 0.85 \\times 0.10 = 0.085$$\n\nThe first term in the denominator is the same as the numerator:\n$$P(\\text{True Positive}) = 0.085$$\n\nThe second term in the denominator is the probability of a false positive result in the population:\n$$P(\\text{False Positive}) = (1 - \\mathrm{Sp}) \\cdot (1 - \\pi) = (1 - 0.90) \\times (1 - 0.10) = 0.10 \\times 0.90 = 0.090$$\n\nThe denominator is the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$:\n$$\\text{Denominator} = 0.085 + 0.090 = 0.175$$\n\nFinally, we compute the $\\mathrm{PPV}$:\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{0.085}{0.175}$$\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} \\approx 0.48571428...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\mathrm{PPV} \\approx 0.4857$$\nThis result indicates that for any individual in this population who tests positive, there is a $48.57\\%$ probability that they actually have hydatid disease.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4857}$$", "id": "4640023"}, {"introduction": "Once cystic echinococcosis is diagnosed, clinical management hinges on assessing the biological activity and burden of the cystic lesions.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part calculation: first, determining the appropriate daily dose of albendazole based on a set of clinical and pharmaceutical constraints, and second, calculating the total cumulative dose administered over a specified cyclic therapy regimen.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the Daily Dose**\n\nThe patient's mass is given as $m = 70$ kg.\nThe recommended therapeutic dosing range for albendazole is from $d_{min} = 10$ mg/kg/day to $d_{max} = 15$ mg/kg/day.\nFirst, we calculate the absolute daily dose range for this specific patient by multiplying the patient's mass by the lower and upper bounds of the recommended dosing range.\n\nThe minimum recommended daily dose, $D_{min}$, is:\n$$D_{min} = m \\times d_{min} = 70\\,\\text{kg} \\times 10\\,\\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} = 700\\,\\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}}$$\n\nThe maximum recommended daily dose, $D_{max}$, is:\n$$D_{max} = m \\times d_{max} = 70\\,\\text{kg} \\times 15\\,\\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} = 1050\\,\\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}}$$\n\nTherefore, the target total daily dose, $D_{daily}$, must be within the interval $[700\\,\\text{mg}, 1050\\,\\text{mg}]$.\n$$700\\,\\text{mg/day} \\le D_{daily} \\le 1050\\,\\text{mg/day}$$\n\nNext, we must consider the pharmaceutical and administration constraints.
