Instead, White Blood Cell (WBC) counts serve as an internal calibrator because WBCs remain intact and their absolute concentration in whole blood is measurable independently. A laboratory technologist examines a thick blood smear and observes $60$ asexual malaria parasites while counting $200$ White Blood Cells (WBC) across the same examined area. The patient’s absolute WBC count from a complete blood count is $8{,}000$ WBC per $\\mu$L. Using first principles of proportional sampling and concentrations, derive an expression for the parasite concentration per $\\mu$L in the original blood and compute its value.

No rounding is required if the value is exact.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and computation of malaria parasite concentration in whole blood, based on counts from a thick blood smear and an absolute white blood cell (WBC) count. It also asks for a qualitative clinical interpretation of the resulting parasite density.\n\nThe validation steps are as follows.\n\nFirst, the given data are extracted verbatim:\n- A technologist observes $60$ asexual malaria parasites.\n- This observation occurs while counting $200$ White Blood Cells (WBCs).\n- The patient’s absolute WBC count is $8{,}000$ WBC per $\\mu$L.\n- The fundamental principle is that the count of a species in a sampled area of a thick smear is proportional to its concentration in the original blood.\n\nSecond, the problem is validated for scientific soundness, clarity, and completeness.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The methodology described is the standard, WHO-endorsed technique for quantifying parasitemia from a thick blood smear. Using the patient's own WBC count as an internal standard is a fundamental and widely accepted practice in clinical parasitology. The premises are factually correct.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary numerical data ($60$ parasites, $200$ WBCs, $8000$ WBCs/$\\mu$L) to establish a ratio and solve for the unknown concentration. The question is unambiguous and leads to a single, stable solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and objective language, free of any subjective or speculative elements.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core principle is proportionality. The ratio of the number of parasites to the number of WBCs counted in a representative area of the thick smear is assumed to be equal to the ratio of their respective concentrations in the original whole blood sample.\n\nLet us define the following variables:\n- $N_p$: the number of parasites counted in the thick smear.\n- $N_{WBC}$: the number of WBCs counted in the same area of the smear.\n- $C_p$: the concentration of parasites in the blood, in units of parasites per microliter ($\\text{parasites}/\\mu\\text{L}$). This is the quantity to be determined.\n- $C_{WBC}$: the absolute concentration of WBCs in the blood, in units of WBCs per microliter ($\\text{WBCs}/\\mu\\text{L}$).\n\nBased on the principle of proportional sampling, we can set up the following relationship:\n$$\n\\frac{N_p}{N_{WBC}} = \\frac{C_p}{C_{WBC}}\n$$\n\nThis equation states that the ratio of counts in the smear is a direct reflection of the ratio of concentrations in the blood volume from which the smear was made.\n\nTo find the parasite concentration, $C_p$, we rearrange this expression:\n$$\nC_p = \\frac{N_p}{N_{WBC}} \\times C_{WBC}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this derived formula:\n- $N_p = 60$\n- $N_{WBC} = 200$\n- $C_{WBC} = 8000 \\, \\text{WBCs}/\\mu\\text{L}$\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n$$\nC_p = \\frac{60}{200} \\times 8000 \\, \\frac{\\text{parasites}}{\\mu\\text{L}}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the ratio of parasites to WBCs in the smear:\n$$\n\\frac{60}{200} = \\frac{6}{20} = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.3\n$$\nNext, we multiply this dimensionless ratio by the absolute WBC concentration:\n$$\nC_p = 0.3 \\times 8000 \\, \\frac{\\text{parasites}}{\\mu\\text{L}} = 2400 \\, \\frac{\\text{parasites}}{\\mu\\text{L}}\n$$\nThus, the calculated parasite concentration is $2400$ parasites per microliter of blood.\n\nFor the qualitative interpretation, we compare this value to established clinical thresholds for malaria severity. Severe malaria, particularly due to *Plasmodium falciparum*, is often associated with hyperparasitemia. While the exact threshold can vary by region and patient immunity, hyperparasitemia is frequently defined as a parasite density exceeding $100,000$ or even $250,000$ parasites/$\\mu$L. A density of $2400$ parasites/$\\mu$L is considered a low to moderate parasite burden. In the absence of other specific signs of severity (e.g., impaired consciousness, respiratory distress, severe anemia, organ dysfunction), this parasite density by itself would suggest **uncomplicated malaria**.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2400}\n$$", "id": "4680022"}, {"introduction": "While microscopy remains a gold standard, Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) are indispensable for malaria control in many settings.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary information is provided. Proceeding with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we derive the general condition for parasite clearance, and second, we use the provided empirical data to estimate the kill fraction $k$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Clearance Condition**\n\nThe dynamics of the total parasitemia $N_t$ under drug treatment are described by the linear difference equation:\n$$N_{t+1} = r(1-k)N_t$$\nLet the factor $\\lambda = r(1-k)$. The equation is $N_{t+1} = \\lambda N_t$. This is a geometric progression. Let $N_0$ be the initial parasitemia at cycle $t=0$. The solution to this difference equation can be written by inspection as:\n$$N_t = N_0 \\lambda^t$$\nFor the parasite population to be cleared, the parasitemia must approach zero as the number of cycles tends to infinity. Mathematically, this is expressed as the limit:\n$$\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} N_t = 0$$\nSubstituting the solution for $N_t$, we get:\n$$\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} N_0 \\lambda^t = 0$$\nAssuming a non-zero initial infection, $N_0 > 0$, this limit condition is satisfied if and only if the absolute value of the base $\\lambda$ is less than $1$:\n$$|\\lambda| < 1$$\nFrom the problem statement, the multiplication factor $r$ is greater than $1$ ($r>1$) and the kill fraction $k$ is in the interval $[0,1]$ ($k \\in [0,1]$). This implies that $1-k$ is also in the interval $[0,1]$. Therefore, the product $\\lambda = r(1-k)$ must be non-negative.\n$$\\lambda = r(1-k) \\geq 0$$\nWith this constraint, the condition $|\\lambda| < 1$ simplifies to:\n$$r(1-k) < 1$$\nThis is the clearance condition on the net per-cycle multiplication factor $r(1-k)$. For the parasite population to decline, the net multiplication factor per cycle must be less than one.\n\n**Part 2: Estimation of the Kill Fraction, $k$**\n\nThe Parasite Reduction Ratio ($\\text{PRR}$) is defined as the fold reduction in parasitemia per cycle:\n$$\\text{PRR} = \\frac{N_t}{N_{t+1}}$$\nFrom the model equation under drug therapy, we have the ratio:\n$$\\frac{N_{t+1}}{N_t} = r(1-k)$$\nBy substituting this into the definition of $\\text{PRR}$, we can relate $\\text{PRR}$ to the model parameters $r$ and $k$:\n$$\\text{PRR} = \\frac{1}{r(1-k)}$$\nWe are given the empirical values for an artemisinin-sensitive infection:\n$$\\text{PRR}_{48\\ \\mathrm{h}} = 10^4$$\n$$r = 12$$\nWe can now substitute these values into the expression for $\\text{PRR}$ and solve for the kill fraction $k$.\n$$10^4 = \\frac{1}{12(1-k)}$$\nRearranging the equation to solve for $k$:\n$$12(1-k) = \\frac{1}{10^4} = 10^{-4}$$\n$$1-k = \\frac{10^{-4}}{12}$$\n$$k = 1 - \\frac{10^{-4}}{12}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $k$.\n$$k = 1 - \\frac{0.0001}{12}$$\nThe fraction is:\n$$\\frac{0.0001}{12} \\approx 0.000008333333...$$\nSo, $k$ is:\n$$k = 1 - 0.000008333333... = 0.999991666666...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to six significant figures. The first five significant figures are $9$, $9$, $9$, $9$, and $9$. The sixth significant figure is $1$. The digit following it is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we must round up the sixth digit.\n$$k \\approx 0.999992$$\nThis value indicates that artemisinin eliminates approximately $99.9992\\%$ of the parasite population in each $48$-hour cycle.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.999992}\n$$", "id": "4680027"}]}
