A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe first objective is to derive the functional form of the growth rate $G$ in terms of the free iron concentration $[I]$ and the constants $G_{\\max}$ and $K_{I}$.\n\nThe fraction of occupied transporters, $\\theta$, is defined as the concentration of iron-bound transporters, $[TI]$, divided by the total transporter concentration, $[T_{\\text{tot}}]$.\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[TI]}{[T_{\\text{tot}}]}\n$$\nThe problem states that the growth rate $G$ is linearly proportional to this fraction, reaching a maximum $G_{\\max}$ when $\\theta=1$. Therefore, the relationship is:\n$$\nG = G_{\\max} \\cdot \\theta = G_{\\max} \\frac{[TI]}{[T_{\\text{tot}}]}\n$$\nTo express $G$ in terms of $[I]$ and $K_{I}$, we must first express the fraction $\\theta$ in these terms. We use the two provided constraints:\n1. The definition of the dissociation constant: $K_{I} = \\frac{[T][I]}{[TI]}$\n2. The conservation of transporters: $[T_{\\text{tot}}] = [T] + [TI]$\n\nFrom the conservation equation (2), we can express the concentration of free transporters, $[T]$, as:\n$$\n[T] = [T_{\\text{tot}}] - [TI]\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[T]$ into the dissociation constant equation (1):\n$$\nK_{I} = \\frac{([T_{\\text{tot}}] - [TI])[I]}{[TI]}\n$$\nNow, we must solve this equation for the fraction $\\frac{[TI]}{[T_{\\text{tot}}]}$. We rearrange the terms:\n$$\nK_{I} [TI] = ([T_{\\text{tot}}] - [TI])[I]\n$$\n$$\nK_{I} [TI] = [T_{\\text{tot}}][I] - [TI][I]\n$$\n$$\nK_{I} [TI] + [TI][I] = [T_{\\text{tot}}][I]\n$$\nFactor out $[TI]$ on the left-hand side:\n$$\n[TI] (K_{I} + [I]) = [T_{\\text{tot}}][I]\n$$\nTo obtain the desired fraction $\\theta = \\frac{[TI]}{[T_{\\text{tot}}]}$, we divide both sides by $[T_{\\text{tot}}]$ and by $(K_{I} + [I])$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[TI]}{[T_{\\text{tot}}]} = \\frac{[I]}{K_{I} + [I]}\n$$\nThis is the functional form for the occupied fraction of transporters. Substituting this back into the equation for the growth rate $G$:\n$$\nG([I]) = G_{\\max} \\frac{[I]}{K_{I} + [I]}\n$$\nThis equation, which has the form of a rectangular hyperbola, is the well-known Hill-Langmuir equation (or Michaelis-Menten equation in the context of enzyme kinetics). This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nThe second objective is to calculate the increase in hyphal growth rate, $\\Delta G$, when the free iron concentration changes from $[I]_1 = 1$ $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to $[I]_2 = 5$ $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, given $G_{\\max} = 1$ mm/day and $K_{I} = 2$ $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the growth rate $G_1$ at $[I]_1 = 1$ $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$:\n$$\nG_1 = G([I]_1) = G_{\\max} \\frac{[I]_1}{K_{I} + [I]_1} = (1 \\text{ mm/day}) \\cdot \\frac{1 \\text{ } \\mu\\mathrm{M}}{2 \\text{ } \\mu\\mathrm{M} + 1 \\text{ } \\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ mm/day}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the growth rate $G_2$ at $[I]_2 = 5$ $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$:\n$$\nG_2 = G([I]_2) = G_{\\max} \\frac{[I]_2}{K_{I} + [I]_2} = (1 \\text{ mm/day}) \\cdot \\frac{5 \\text{ } \\mu\\mathrm{M}}{2 \\text{ } \\mu\\mathrm{M} + 5 \\text{ } \\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{5}{7} \\text{ mm/day}\n$$\nThe increase in growth rate is the difference $\\Delta G = G_2 - G_1$:\n$$\n\\Delta G = \\frac{5}{7} - \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nTo subtract the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $7 \\times 3 = 21$:\n$$\n\\Delta G = \\frac{5 \\cdot 3}{7 \\cdot 3} - \\frac{1 \\cdot 7}{3 \\cdot 7} = \\frac{15}{21} - \\frac{7}{21} = \\frac{15 - 7}{21} = \\frac{8}{21}\n$$\nThe resulting increase in growth rate is $\\frac{8}{21}$ mm/day.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{8}{21}}\n$$", "id": "4669542"}, {"introduction": "Interpreting the results of diagnostic tests is a cornerstone of clinical practice, requiring a nuanced understanding of probability.

It presents a standard pharmacological calculation within a clinically realistic context—the treatment of invasive mucormycosis with amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC). All data required for the calculation are provided and are consistent with established medical practice.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part response: first, the calculation of the cumulative drug exposure, and second, a justification for two specific renal monitoring thresholds.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Cumulative Amphotericin B Exposure**\n\nThe calculation proceeds from the first principles stated in the problem.\nLet $BW$ represent the patient's body weight, $D_{norm}$ be the weight-normalized daily dose, and $T$ be the duration of therapy in days.\nThe given values are:\n- $BW = 70$ kg\n- $D_{norm} = 5$ mg/kg/day\n- $T = 14$ days\n\nFirst, we determine the absolute daily dose, denoted as $D_{daily}$.

Since the dose is administered daily for $14$ consecutive days without adjustment, the cumulative dose is the product of the absolute daily dose and the number of days of therapy:\n$$D_{cumul} = D_{daily} \\times T$$\nSubstituting the calculated daily dose and the given duration:\n$$D_{cumul} = (350 \\text{ mg/day}) \\times (14 \\text{ days}) = 4900 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $4900$ mg. To express this value unambiguously with three significant figures, we represent it in scientific notation as $4.90 \\times 10^3$ mg.\n\n**Part 2: Justification of Renal Monitoring Thresholds**\n\nThe use of any amphotericin B formulation mandates rigorous monitoring for nephrotoxicity. While lipid formulations like ABLC are less nephrotoxic than the conventional deoxycholate form, the risk remains significant. Intervention thresholds are based on detecting clinically meaningful changes in renal function. Two widely accepted quantitative thresholds that would prompt intervention are:\n\n1.  **An increase in serum creatinine (SCr) to a level more than double ($>100\\%$) the baseline value.**\n    *   **Justification:** Serum creatinine is a standard marker for glomerular filtration rate (GFR). A doubling of the baseline SCr corresponds to Stage $2$ Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. This signifies a substantial and acute reduction in renal function (an approximate $50\\%$ loss of GFR). Reaching this threshold is a critical safety signal for drug-induced nephrotoxicity, warranting immediate intervention. Interventions may include intensified hydration, dose reduction of the ABLC, extending the dosing interval, or, if the clinical situation permits, switching to a non-nephrotoxic antifungal agent (e.g., an azole or echinocandin). This action is necessary to prevent progression to more severe, potentially irreversible kidney damage.\n\n2.  **A decrease in serum potassium to a level below $2.5$ mEq/L (or $2.5$ mmol/L).**\n    *   **Justification:** Amphotericin B induces nephrotoxicity through two primary mechanisms: afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction (reducing GFR) and direct toxicity to renal tubular epithelial cells. The latter mechanism leads to impaired reabsorption of electrolytes, most notably potassium and magnesium. Hypokalemia is therefore a frequent complication. While mild hypokalemia (e.g., K$^+$ between $3.0$ and $3.5$ mEq/L) can be managed with electrolyte supplementation, a serum potassium concentration below $2.5$ mEq/L is defined as severe hypokalemia. This condition carries a high risk of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias (such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation) and profound muscle weakness, including paralysis of respiratory muscles. It is a medical emergency that requires immediate, aggressive potassium repletion, typically via the intravenous route. From a therapeutic standpoint, it signals severe tubular toxicity and is a strong indication to re-evaluate the amphotericin B regimen, as continued administration without modification poses an unacceptable risk to the patient.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.90 \\times 10^3}$$", "id": "4669549"}]}
