The ELISA has sensitivity $Se=0.995$ and specificity $Sp=0.997$ when applied to whole blood donations. A fraction $f_{e}=0.05$ of donors were born in endemic areas for Trypanosoma cruzi, where the donor infection prevalence is $p_{e}=0.02$. The remaining fraction $f_{n}=0.95$ of donors were born in non-endemic areas, where the donor infection prevalence is $p_{n}=2\\times 10^{-5}$. The service transfuses $N=450000$ whole-blood units per year. All units that are reactive on screening are discarded; only nonreactive units are transfused. Assume that any transfused unit originating from an infected donor results in recipient infection and that infection status, test outcomes, and donor subpopulation membership are independent in the sense required by the standard definitions of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity. Ignore African trypanosomiasis (Trypanosoma brucei), as its donor prevalence in this setting is negligible and there is no routine screening for it.\n\nUsing only core definitions of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity, compute the expected number of transfusion-transmitted Chagas disease cases per year in this region under these assumptions. Round your final answer to three significant figures. Express your answer as a real number with no units.", "solution": "The objective is to calculate the expected number of transfusion-transmitted Chagas disease cases per year. A case of transfusion-transmitted infection occurs if a unit of donated blood is from an infected donor and it yields a false-negative screening result, leading to it being transfused. The problem assumes a $100\\%$ transmission rate from such a unit. Therefore, the expected number of cases is the total number of transfused units per year, $N$, multiplied by the probability that a randomly selected unit is from an infected donor and tests negative.\n\nLet us define the relevant events and probabilities based on the givens:\n- $I$: The event that a donor is infected with *Trypanosoma cruzi*.\n- $I^c$: The event that a donor is not infected.\n- $T^{+}$: The event that a blood unit tests positive (reactive).\n- $T^{-}$: The event that a blood unit tests negative (nonreactive).\n- $E$: The event that a donor is from an endemic region.\n- $N_{E}$: The event that a donor is from a non-endemic region.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Sensitivity of the test, $Se = P(T^{+} | I) = 0.995$.\n- Specificity of the test, $Sp = P(T^{-} | I^c) = 0.997$.\n- Fraction of donors from endemic areas, $P(E) = f_{e} = 0.05$.\n- Prevalence of infection in donors from endemic areas, $P(I | E) = p_{e} = 0.02$.\n- Fraction of donors from non-endemic areas, $P(N_E) = f_{n} = 0.95$.\n- Prevalence of infection in donors from non-endemic areas, $P(I | N_E) = p_{n} = 2 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n- Total blood units transfused per year, $N = 450000$.\n\nAn infected unit is transfused only if it tests negative.

The design must respect the following foundational facts: (i) the Central Dogma (DNA is transcribed to RNA and translated to protein) implies that complete loss of a gene’s product should abolish its function; (ii) T. cruzi is diploid (has $2$ genomic copies of most loci), lacks endogenous RNA interference, and repairs Cas9-induced double-strand breaks primarily via homology-directed repair (HDR) when donor templates with flanking homology are provided; and (iii) to validate essentiality without killing the parasite during construction, a functional complement must be provided under conditional control, so that protein levels can be turned off acutely and reversibly to test phenotypes and pharmacologic interactions.\n\nYou have plasmids to express Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 and a guide RNA (gRNA) targeting the open reading frame of the candidate enzyme, and you can assemble donor DNA cassettes carrying antibiotic resistance genes with homology arms for HDR. You also have a tetracycline-regulated expression system to place a complement copy of the enzyme under an inducible promoter at a “safe harbor” locus, and you can tag the complement with a small epitope for detection. Available positive selection markers in T. cruzi include neomycin (G$418$), hygromycin, puromycin, blasticidin, and phleomycin. Assume that HDR integrations into the two endogenous alleles occur independently with probabilities $p$ and $q$ when donor cassettes carrying distinct resistance markers are co-transfected. Cells are plated after transfection, selected with antibiotics, cloned by limiting dilution, and genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) across junctions and immunoblotting for the tagged complement.\n\nWhich option most correctly describes a CRISPR/Cas9-based strategy to generate a conditionally null mutant of the candidate enzyme and a scientifically sound selection scheme to isolate edited clones that have both endogenous alleles replaced and a conditional complement in place, while minimizing lethality during construction and maximizing the expected yield of correctly edited parasites?\n\nA. Introduce the tetracycline-inducible complement at a safe harbor locus first, confirm its expression under tetracycline, then perform CRISPR/Cas9 with two HDR donor cassettes replacing each endogenous allele with distinct resistance markers (e.g., hygromycin and neomycin). Apply triple selection (G$418$ for Cas9 or the complement backbone if needed, plus hygromycin and neomycin) immediately after transfection to enrich for cells with the complement and both allelic replacements, then clone and confirm edits by PCR and immunoblot. After construction, remove tetracycline to shut off the complement, producing a conditional null; the expected fraction of surviving cells under dual allelic selection is $pq$, and triple selection ensures retention of the complement, mitigating lethality during editing.\n\nB. Use RNA interference driven by a T. cruzi U$6$ promoter to knock down the candidate enzyme without any CRISPR editing, selecting transfectants with puromycin; then assess essentiality by measuring growth arrest. If knockdown is lethal, infer drug target validity. No complementary copy is needed, because RNA interference is reversible.\n\nC. Co-transfect a cytidine base editor (dCas9 fused to cytidine deaminase) with a gRNA to mutate an active-site codon in one endogenous allele, selecting only with blasticidin for the editor plasmid; isolate fluorescent clones by sorting based on a reporter co-expressed with the base editor. Do not introduce a complement to avoid overexpression artifacts. Validate essentiality by comparing growth with and without a small-molecule inhibitor; if the mutated enzyme resists inhibition, infer on-target drug action.\n\nD. Flox the candidate enzyme with loxP sites in one endogenous allele using CRISPR/Cas9 HDR and express dimerizable Cre recombinase (DiCre) under a constitutive promoter; select with one antibiotic for the loxP integration. Excise the floxed allele with rapamycin to test essentiality.

First, it establishes a \"safety net\" by introducing a tetracycline-inducible rescue copy (complement) of the gene at a neutral \"safe harbor\" locus. This ensures the parasite remains viable throughout the subsequent gene knockout steps by keeping the complement expressed with tetracycline. Second, it uses CRISPR/Cas9 to replace both endogenous alleles with two distinct antibiotic resistance markers. Selecting with both antibiotics ensures that only clones with both alleles successfully deleted will survive. Finally, the conditional nature is demonstrated by removing tetracycline, which shuts down the rescue copy and reveals the essential phenotype (e.g., growth arrest). This sequence minimizes lethality during construction and maximizes the yield of correctly edited parasites.\n\n- **Option B** is incorrect because it proposes using RNA interference (RNAi), but the problem statement correctly notes that *T. cruzi* lacks a functional endogenous RNAi pathway.\n\n- **Option C** is incorrect because it proposes mutating only one of the two alleles using a base editor.
