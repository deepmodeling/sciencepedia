The described mechanism—*Leishmania* parasites expressing arginase to compete with host iNOS for L-arginine, thereby reducing cytotoxic NO production—is a known and well-documented virulence strategy. The use of Michaelis-Menten kinetics to model enzyme activity and an exponential decay model for inhibition are standard and appropriate formalisms in quantitative biology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is self-contained.

Each sandfly bites at rate $a$ bites per sandfly per day. With $m$ sandflies per human, the total biting rate on this infectious human is $a m$ bites per day. Each bite infects the sandfly with probability $c$, so the rate at which sandflies become infected due to this human is $a m c$ per day.
