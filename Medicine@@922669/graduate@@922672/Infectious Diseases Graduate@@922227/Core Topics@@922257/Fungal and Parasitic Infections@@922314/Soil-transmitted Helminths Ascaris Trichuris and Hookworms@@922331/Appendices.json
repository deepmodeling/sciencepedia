The derivation will be based on the provided definition of concentration and the principle of mass conservation.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between mass, volume, and concentration. The concentration of iron in the blood, $c_{\\mathrm{Fe}}$, is given as the mass of iron, $m_{\\mathrm{Fe}}$, per unit volume of blood, $V$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{Fe}}}{V}$$\nThis equation can be algebraically rearranged to find the mass of iron contained in a specific volume of blood:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = c_{\\mathrm{Fe}} \\cdot V$$\nThe principle of mass conservation dictates that the mass of iron lost per day must equal the mass of iron contained in the total volume of blood lost per day, given the assumption of negligible iron recovery.\n\nThe total daily blood loss is a function of the number of worms (worm burden), $n$, and the average volume of blood lost per worm per day, $\\ell$. If there are $n$ worms and each is responsible for a blood loss of $\\ell$, the total volume of blood lost per day, which we shall denote $V_{\\text{daily}}$, is the product of these two quantities:\n$$V_{\\text{daily}} = n \\cdot \\ell$$\nThe daily iron loss, $I$, is the mass of iron contained in this volume $V_{\\text{daily}}$. Using the rearranged concentration formula, we can express $I$ as:\n$$I = c_{\\mathrm{Fe}} \\cdot V_{\\text{daily}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{\\text{daily}}$ into this equation, we arrive at the final analytic expression for daily iron loss as a function of the given parameters:\n$$I = n \\cdot \\ell \\cdot c_{\\mathrm{Fe}}$$\nThis is the required analytic expression. We can verify the dimensional consistency of this formula. The units for $n$ are dimensionless (worms), for $\\ell$ are $\\mathrm{mL/day}$, and for $c_{\\mathrm{Fe}}$ are $\\mathrm{mg/mL}$. The product of the units is:\n$$(\\text{dimensionless}) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{day}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{mL}}\\right) = \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{day}}$$\nThis result has the correct units for a daily mass loss, confirming the validity of the derived expression.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression using the numerical values provided in the problem statement:\nWorm burden, $n = 200$.\nPer-worm daily blood loss, $\\ell = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{mL/day}$.\nBlood iron concentration, $c_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation for $I$:\n$$I = (200) \\cdot (0.03\\,\\mathrm{mL/day}) \\cdot (0.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL})$$\nWe can now perform the arithmetic calculation:\n$$I = (200 \\cdot 0.03 \\cdot 0.5) \\, \\mathrm{mg/day}$$\n$$I = (6 \\cdot 0.5) \\, \\mathrm{mg/day}$$\n$$I = 3 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed to three significant figures.
