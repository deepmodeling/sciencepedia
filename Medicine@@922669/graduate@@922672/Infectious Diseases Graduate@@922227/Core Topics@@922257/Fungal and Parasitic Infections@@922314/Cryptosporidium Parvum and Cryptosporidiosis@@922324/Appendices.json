This indicates that the risk of developing cryptosporidiosis was $3.5$ times higher for diapered toddlers who participated in the wading-pool water-play compared to those who did not. This is a strong association. For the toilet-trained preschoolers, the risk ratio is $RR_{TP, WP} = \\frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2.0$, also indicating an elevated risk. The combination of a strong statistical association ($RR = 3.5$) in the most susceptible population (diapered toddlers) and the known biological plausibility—that *Cryptosporidium* oocysts are resistant to chlorination and frequently transmitted via recreational water—points to the wading pool as the most likely predominant route of transmission in this outbreak. The cases among non-exposed individuals likely represent secondary person-to-person transmission, which is also common with this pathogen.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of the risk ratio for diapered toddlers, rounded to $4$ significant figures.\nThe calculated value is exactly $3.5$.

The solution will proceed by first deriving the theoretical relationship governing the qPCR assay, then calibrating this model using provided standards, and finally using this calibration along with an internal control to quantify the unknown sample after correcting for matrix inhibition.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the linear relationship between $C_t$ and $\\log_{10}(N_0)$**\n\nThe fundamental principle of exponential amplification in PCR is given by the equation:\n$$N(c) = N_0 (1+E)^{c}$$\nwhere $N(c)$ is the number of amplicon copies after $c$ cycles, $N_0$ is the initial template copy number, and $E$ is the constant per-cycle amplification efficiency.\n\nThe cycle threshold, $C_t$, is defined as the cycle number at which the amplicon copy number reaches a fixed detection threshold, $N_T$. At this point, $c = C_t$ and $N(C_t) = N_T$. Substituting these into the amplification equation gives:\n$$N_T = N_0 (1+E)^{C_t}$$\nTo derive the relationship between $C_t$ and $\\log_{10}(N_0)$, we first isolate the term containing the exponent $C_t$:\n$$\\frac{N_T}{N_0} = (1+E)^{C_t}$$\nNext, we take the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides of the equation. This choice of base is motivated by the desire to obtain an expression linear in $\\log_{10}(N_0)$.\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_T}{N_0}\\right) = \\log_{10}\\left((1+E)^{C_t}\\right)$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\log(x/y) = \\log(x) - \\log(y)$ and $\\log(x^p) = p \\log(x)$, we can expand both sides:\n$$\\log_{10}(N_T) - \\log_{10}(N_0) = C_t \\log_{10}(1+E)$$\nTo express $C_t$ as a function of $\\log_{10}(N_0)$, we rearrange the equation to solve for $C_t$:\n$$C_t = \\frac{\\log_{10}(N_T) - \\log_{10}(N_0)}{\\log_{10}(1+E)}$$\nSeparating the terms gives the linear form $C_t = a + b \\cdot \\log_{10}(N_0)$:\n$$C_t = \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(1+E)}\\right) \\log_{10}(N_0) + \\frac{\\log_{10}(N_T)}{\\log_{10}(1+E)}$$\nFrom this derived equation, we can identify the slope and intercept of the linear relationship.\nThe slope, $b$, is the coefficient of the $\\log_{10}(N_0)$ term:\n$$b = -\\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(1+E)}$$\nThe intercept, $a$, is the constant term:\n$$a = \\frac{\\log_{10}(N_T)}{\\log_{10}(1+E)}$$\nSince $N_T$ and $E$ are assumed to be constant for a given assay run, both the slope $b$ and the intercept $a$ are constants, confirming the linear relationship between $C_t$ and $\\log_{10}(N_0)$.\n\n**Task 2: Determination of the best-fit line from standards data**\n\nThe problem provides data from a set of standards with known initial copy numbers, $N_0$, and their measured cycle thresholds, $C_t$. We first transform the $N_0$ values into their base-$10$ logarithmic form, which we denote as $x = \\log_{10}(N_0)$. Let $y = C_t$.\n\nThe provided data pairs $(N_0, C_t)$ are:\n$(10^7, 15.30)$, $(10^6, 18.60)$, $(10^5, 21.90)$, $(10^4, 25.20)$, $(10^3, 28.50)$.\n\nThe corresponding pairs $(x, y) = (\\log_{10}(N_0), C_t)$ are:\n$(7, 15.30)$, $(6, 18.60)$, $(5, 21.90)$, $(4, 25.20)$, $(3, 28.50)$.\n\nTo find the best-fit line $C_t = a + b \\log_{10}(N_0)$, we can perform a linear regression. However, a preliminary check reveals that the data points are perfectly collinear. We can calculate the slope $b$ between any two consecutive points:\n$$b = \\frac{\\Delta C_t}{\\Delta \\log_{10}(N_0)} = \\frac{18.60 - 15.30}{6 - 7} = \\frac{3.30}{-1} = -3.30$$\n$$b = \\frac{21.90 - 18.60}{5 - 6} = \\frac{3.30}{-1} = -3.30$$\nThe slope is constant for all intervals, confirming perfect linearity. Thus, the slope of the best-fit line is $b = -3.30$.\nThe justification for this linearity is the theoretical model derived in Task 1, which predicts a linear relationship under the assumption of constant amplification efficiency $E$. The perfect linearity of the standard data indicates that it was idealized to perfectly match this model.\n\nNow we determine the intercept $a$ by substituting the slope $b$ and any one of the data points into the linear equation. Using the first point $(x,y) = (7, 15.30)$:\n$$15.30 = a + (-3.30)(7)$$\n$$15.30 = a - 23.10$$\n$$a = 15.30 + 23.10 = 38.40$$\nTherefore, the equation for the standard curve is:\n$$C_t = 38.40 - 3.30 \\log_{10}(N_0)$$\nThe parameters for the best-fit line are $a = 38.40$ and $b = -3.30$.\n\n**Task 3: Estimation of $\\Delta$, correction of $C_t$, and calculation of $N_{0,\\mathrm{unknown}}$**\n\nThe effect of matrix inhibitors is modeled as a constant positive shift $\\Delta$ in the cycle threshold, such that $C_{t, \\text{inhibited}} = C_{t, \\text{ideal}} + \\Delta$. We can estimate $\\Delta$ using the internal amplification control (IAC).\n\nThe IAC has an initial copy number of $S_0 = 10^4$. First, we determine its ideal $C_t$ (the value expected in a non-inhibitory matrix like nuclease-free water) using the standard curve equation derived in Task 2.\n$$\\log_{10}(S_0) = \\log_{10}(10^4) = 4$$\n$$C_{t, \\text{ideal, IAC}} = 38.40 - 3.30 \\times 4 = 38.40 - 13.20 = 25.20$$\nThis ideal $C_t$ value matches the one given in the standards data for $N_0 = 10^4$, serving as a consistency check.\n\nThe measured $C_t$ for the IAC in the stool extract matrix is given as $C_{t, \\text{inhibited, IAC}} = 26.70$. The shift $\\Delta$ is the difference between the inhibited and ideal $C_t$ values:\n$$\\Delta = C_{t, \\text{inhibited, IAC}} - C_{t, \\text{ideal, IAC}} = 26.70 - 25.20 = 1.50$$\nThus, the stool matrix introduces an amplification delay of $1.50$ cycles.\n\nNext, we correct the measured $C_t$ of the unknown sample. The problem states that the unknown was in the same stool extract matrix and that $\\Delta$ is independent of the initial copy number.\nThe measured $C_t$ for the unknown is $C_{t, \\text{measured, unknown}} = 32.80$. We find the corrected (ideal) $C_t$ by subtracting the inhibitory shift $\\Delta$:\n$$C_{t, \\text{corrected, unknown}} = C_{t, \\text{measured, unknown}} - \\Delta = 32.80 - 1.50 = 31.30$$\n\nFinally, we use this corrected $C_t$ value to compute the initial copy number of the unknown sample, $N_{0,\\mathrm{unknown}}$, by inverting the standard curve equation:\n$$C_t = 38.40 - 3.30 \\log_{10}(N_0) \\implies \\log_{10}(N_0) = \\frac{38.40 - C_t}{3.30}$$\nSubstituting $C_{t, \\text{corrected, unknown}} = 31.30$:\n$$\\log_{10}(N_{0,\\mathrm{unknown}}) = \\frac{38.40 - 31.30}{3.30} = \\frac{7.10}{3.30}$$\nNow, we solve for $N_{0,\\mathrm{unknown}}$:\n$$N_{0,\\mathrm{unknown}} = 10^{(7.10/3.30)} \\approx 10^{2.151515...} \\approx 141.763...$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to three significant figures.\n$$N_{0,\\mathrm{unknown}} \\approx 142$$\nThe initial copy number for the unknown sample is approximately $142$ gene copies per reaction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{142}$$", "id": "4637006"}, {"introduction": "A defining feature of *Cryptosporidium parvum* is the remarkable resistance of its oocysts to standard chemical disinfectants like chlorine, a cornerstone of public water safety.

The rate of change of viable oocysts with time, $t$, is therefore described by the following second-order rate law:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = -k C N $$\nwhere $k$ is the second-order rate constant.\n\nIn a typical disinfection scenario within a contact chamber, the disinfectant concentration $C$ is maintained at a constant value.

The base-$10$ log inactivation is defined as:\n$$ L = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_0}{N_t}\\right) = -\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_t}{N_0}\\right) $$\nTo relate the natural logarithm to the base-$10$ logarithm, we use the change of base formula: $\\ln(x) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}(x)$. Applying this to our integrated rate law:\n$$ \\ln(10) \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_t}{N_0}\\right) = -k (Ct) $$\nSubstituting the definition of $L$:\n$$ \\ln(10) (-L) = -k (Ct) $$\n$$ L \\ln(10) = k (Ct) $$\nThe problem asks for an expression that links the rate constant $k$ to a known $Ct$ value and a specified base-$10$ log inactivation $L$.

Since $k$ depends on these conditions, we can assume $k$ is the same for the reference case and the plant's operational case.\n\nFrom the relationship $L \\ln(10) = k (Ct)$, it is clear that for a constant $k$, the log inactivation $L$ is directly proportional to the $Ct$ product. We can write this as a ratio:\n$$ \\frac{L_{plant}}{(Ct)_{plant}} = \\frac{k}{\\ln(10)} = \\frac{L_{ref}}{(Ct)_{ref}} $$\nRearranging to solve for the log inactivation at the plant, $L_{plant}$:\n$$ L_{plant} = L_{ref} \\frac{(Ct)_{plant}}{(Ct)_{ref}} $$\nThis relationship shows that we do not need to explicitly calculate the value of $k$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the $Ct$ product for the plant's operating conditions:\n-   Chlorine concentration $C_{plant} = 1.0 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, L^{-1}}$\n-   Contact time $t_{plant} = 30 \\ \\mathrm{min}$\n$$ (Ct)_{plant} = C_{plant} \\times t_{plant} = (1.0 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, L^{-1}}) \\times (30 \\ \\mathrm{min}) = 30 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, min \\, L^{-1}} $$\nNow, we can calculate the expected log inactivation $L_{plant}$ using the reference values:\n-   Reference log inactivation $L_{ref} = 2.0$\n-   Reference $Ct$ product $(Ct)_{ref} = 7200 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, min \\, L^{-1}}$\n$$ L_{plant} = 2.0 \\times \\frac{30 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, min \\, L^{-1}}}{7200 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, min \\, L^{-1}}} $$\n$$ L_{plant} = 2.0 \\times \\frac{30}{7200} = 2.0 \\times \\frac{1}{240} = \\frac{2}{240} = \\frac{1}{120} $$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal and rounding to three significant figures:\n$$ L_{plant} = \\frac{1}{120} \\approx 0.0083333... $$\n$$ L_{plant} \\approx 0.00833 $$\n\n**Part 3: Mechanistic Justification for Chlorine Resistance**\n\nThe limited efficacy of free chlorine against *Cryptosporidium parvum* oocysts, as demonstrated by the very high required $Ct$ value of $7200 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, min \\, L^{-1}}$ for a mere $2.0$-log kill, is primarily due to the unique structure of the oocyst wall. This wall is a robust, multi-layered barrier that protects the infective sporozoites inside.\n\nMechanistically, free chlorine (predominantly as hypochlorous acid, $HOCl$, at $pH=7$) acts by oxidizing vital cellular components. However, to be effective, the disinfectant must first penetrate the oocyst wall to reach these targets. The *C. parvum* oocyst wall is exceptionally impermeable to chemical oxidants. It is composed of a tough outer layer and a thick inner layer containing highly cross-linked proteins, including cysteine-rich proteins. This structure serves as a formidable physical and chemical barrier, consuming large amounts of the disinfectant before any significant damage can be inflicted upon the internal sporozoites. Consequently, the rate of penetration and reaction with critical internal sites is extremely slow, necessitating either very high chlorine concentrations or very long contact times to achieve effective inactivation, resulting in the observed high $Ct$ values.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.00833}$$", "id": "4625234"}]}
