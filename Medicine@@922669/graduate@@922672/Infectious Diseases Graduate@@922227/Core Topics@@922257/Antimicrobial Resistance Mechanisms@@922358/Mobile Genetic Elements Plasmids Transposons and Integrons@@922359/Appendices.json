By calculating the probability of plasmid loss per generation [@problem_id:4666682], you will gain a quantitative appreciation for why low-copy-number plasmids are inherently unstable and why active partitioning or strong selective pressure is critical for their long-term maintenance.", "problem": "In a bacterial pathogen relevant to infectious diseases, consider a circular plasmid that carries a class 1 integron embedded within a transposon and confers multidrug resistance, where the plasmid lacks any active partitioning system (for example, no ParA-ParB-parS partitioning locus, often collectively referred to as ParABS). In the absence of active partitioning, individual plasmid copies segregate stochastically at cell division. Assume the following fundamental base grounded in well-tested facts and definitions:\n\n- Plasmids are mobile genetic elements that replicate autonomously and are segregated to daughter cells at division. Without active partitioning, each plasmid copy independently chooses one of the two daughter cells with equal probability.\n- The segregation of copies to a particular daughter cell can be modeled as independent Bernoulli trials with success probability $p=\\frac{1}{2}$, and the number of copies received by that daughter follows a binomial distribution.\n- A plasmid-free daughter cell arises when the number of copies received by that daughter is zero.\n\nStarting from these principles, derive an analytic expression for the per-generation probability that a randomly chosen daughter cell is plasmid-free as a function of the plasmid copy number $n$ at division. Then evaluate this probability for a plasmid with copy number $n=3$. Provide the exact value of the probability as your final answer. Finally, briefly interpret the implications of this result for the maintenance of integron- and transposon-bearing plasmids in pathogen populations under conditions of no antibiotic selection, connecting to the expected influence of selection and genetic drift on mobile genetic element persistence. Do not round; report the exact value.", "solution": "The problem asks for the probability that a randomly chosen daughter cell is plasmid-free. This event occurs when a specific daughter cell receives zero plasmid copies during segregation.\n\nLet $n$ be the total number of plasmid copies in the parent bacterium just before cell division. The problem states that each of the $n$ copies segregates to one of the two daughter cells independently and with equal probability. Let us designate one specific daughter cell as the cell of interest.\n\nFor each of the $n$ plasmid copies, the segregation process can be modeled as a Bernoulli trial. Let a \"success\" be the event that a single plasmid copy segregates to our chosen daughter cell. The probability of success for any single plasmid copy is $p = \\frac{1}{2}$. The probability of \"failure\" (the copy segregating to the other daughter cell) is $1 - p = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSince the $n$ plasmid copies segregate independently, the total number of copies, $X$, received by our chosen daughter cell follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n$ (the number of trials) and $p = \\frac{1}{2}$ (the probability of success). We denote this as $X \\sim B(n, p)$.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for a binomial distribution gives the probability of obtaining exactly $k$ successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials, and is given by the formula:\n$$P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\nwhere $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ is the binomial coefficient.\n\nA daughter cell is plasmid-free if it receives $k=0$ copies. We therefore need to calculate the probability $P(X=0)$. Substituting $k=0$ and $p=\\frac{1}{2}$ into the binomial PMF, we get:\n$$P(X=0) = \\binom{n}{0} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^0 \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{n-0}$$\n\nWe evaluate each term in this expression:\n1.  The binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{0}$ is defined as $\\frac{n!}{0!(n-0)!} = \\frac{n!}{1 \\cdot n!} = 1$. This signifies that there is only one way to choose zero copies from a set of $n$.\n2.  Any non-zero number raised to the power of $0$ is $1$. Thus, $(\\frac{1}{2})^0 = 1$.\n3.  The remaining term is $(1-\\frac{1}{2})^{n} = (\\frac{1}{2})^n = \\frac{1}{2^n}$.\n\nMultiplying these terms together gives the analytic expression for the per-generation probability of a daughter cell being plasmid-free:\n$$P(\\text{plasmid-free}) = P(X=0) = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n$$\nThis is the general expression as a function of the plasmid copy number $n$.\n\nNext, we evaluate this probability for a plasmid with copy number $n=3$:\n$$P(\\text{plasmid-free for } n=3) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1^3}{2^3} = \\frac{1}{8}$$\nThe exact value of the probability is $\\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nFinally, we interpret the implications of this result. A per-generation loss probability of $\\frac{1}{8}$, or $12.5\\%$, is very high. In the absence of selective pressure (i.e., no antibiotics in the environment), the multidrug resistance conferred by the plasmid provides no fitness advantage to the host bacterium. In fact, maintaining the plasmid, replicating its DNA, and expressing its genes (including those in the integron and transposon) incurs a metabolic cost, which typically results in a slight fitness disadvantage compared to plasmid-free cells.\n\nThe two main forces governing the plasmid's prevalence in the population are genetic drift (stochastic loss at division) and selection. Without positive selection for the plasmid, the high rate of stochastic loss ($12.5\\%$ per generation) combined with the metabolic burden will cause plasmid-free cells to rapidly outcompete plasmid-bearing cells. Consequently, the plasmid, along with the mobile genetic elements it carries (the transposon and integron), would be expected to be quickly purged from the pathogen population. This theoretical result underscores the critical importance of two factors for plasmid persistence in nature: first, the evolution of active partitioning systems (like ParABS) that ensure stable, non-stochastic inheritance, especially for low-copy-number plasmids; and second, the powerful role of selection (such as the widespread use of antibiotics) in maintaining otherwise unstable resistance plasmids in bacterial populations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$$", "id": "4666682"}, {"introduction": "Beyond stable inheritance, the fate of a plasmid is governed by its effect on host fitness. Carrying extra genetic material like a plasmid, transposon, or integron often imposes a metabolic burden, which can lead to its elimination in the absence of selection. This practice provides a method to quantify this effect by calculating the selection coefficient ($s$) from a simulated competition experiment [@problem_id:4666670]. Mastering this calculation is essential for predicting the population dynamics of mobile resistance elements under different environmental conditions, such as varying levels of antibiotic exposure.", "problem": "A hospital-associated isolate of Enterobacteriaceae causing bloodstream infections carries a conjugative multidrug resistance plasmid harboring a class 1 integron that encodes an aminoglycoside acetyltransferase gene cassette. A transposon insertion within the plasmid backbone is known to impose a metabolic burden on the host. To quantify the net effect of plasmid carriage on fitness under sub-inhibitory antibiotic exposure, a head-to-head competition was performed between an isogenic plasmid-bearing lineage and its plasmid-free counterpart in well-mixed batch culture. Lineages were distinguished using chromosomal barcodes, and plasmid carriage at the sampling time was verified by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR).\n\nAssume well-mixed exponential growth for both lineages in the assay environment, with per-hour Malthusian parameters $r_P$ for the plasmid-bearing founder lineage and $r_F$ for the plasmid-free founder lineage. The selection coefficient is defined as $s = r_P - r_F$. Plasmid loss in the plasmid-bearing lineage occurs as a first-order process with constant hazard $\\lambda$ per hour, such that the retention fraction at time $t$ is $f_{\\mathrm{ret}}(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$. The barcode design ensures that counts attributed to the plasmid-free lineage at time $t$ trace only to its founder lineage and do not include descendants of plasmid-bearing cells that shed the plasmid during the assay.

Both lineages are assumed to grow exponentially.\n\nFor the plasmid-free founder lineage, the growth is described by a simple exponential model with a Malthusian parameter $r_F$. The number of cells at time $t$, denoted as $N_F^{\\mathrm{obs}}(t)$, is given by:\n$$N_F^{\\mathrm{obs}}(t) = N_F(0) \\exp(r_F t)$$\nwhere $N_F(0)$ is the initial cell count at $t=0$.\n\nFor the plasmid-bearing founder lineage, the population dynamics are more complex. The cells grow with an intrinsic Malthusian parameter $r_P$. However, they also lose the plasmid at a constant hazard rate $\\lambda$. This loss process removes cells from the plasmid-bearing population. The rate of change of the plasmid-bearing population, $N_P(t)$, is therefore the rate of growth minus the rate of loss:\n$$\\frac{dN_P(t)}{dt} = r_P N_P(t) - \\lambda N_P(t) = (r_P - \\lambda) N_P(t)$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. Its solution, with the initial condition $N_P(0)$, gives the number of cells that originated from the plasmid-bearing founder and still carry the plasmid at time $t$. The problem specifies that the observed count for this lineage, $N_P^{\\mathrm{obs}}(t)$, corresponds to this quantity. Thus:\n$$N_P^{\\mathrm{obs}}(t) = N_P(0) \\exp((r_P - \\lambda)t)$$\nThe problem statement's definition of barcode-resolved counts ensures that cells from the $P$ lineage that lose their plasmid are not counted in $N_F^{\\mathrm{obs}}(t)$, justifying this separated modeling approach.\n\nThe selection coefficient is defined as $s = r_P - r_F$.

The antibiotic is removed by the $\\beta$-lactamase enzyme at a rate $J_{deg}$.\n\nThe Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) is the external concentration, $[A]_{out} = MIC$, at which the internal concentration, $[A]_{in}$, reaches a critical threshold, $[A]_{crit}$, sufficient to inhibit growth.
