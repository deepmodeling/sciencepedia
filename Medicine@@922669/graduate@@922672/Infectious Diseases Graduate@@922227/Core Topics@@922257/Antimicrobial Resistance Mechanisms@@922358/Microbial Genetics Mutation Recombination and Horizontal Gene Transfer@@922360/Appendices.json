Other repair pathways do not act on these specific polymerase-generated mismatches.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is assessed against the validation criteria:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on fundamental and well-established principles of molecular biology, specifically DNA replication fidelity, the function of DNA polymerase proofreading, and the Mismatch Repair (MMR) system. The role of MutS as an initiator of MMR is accurate.

The assumptions of independence and stationarity are explicitly stated, which is necessary for the probabilistic model. There are no contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the fold-increase in mutation rate in a MutS knockout strain relative to a wild-type strain. This can be expressed as the ratio of their respective mutation rates, $\\frac{\\mu_{MutS^-}}{\\mu_{WT}}$. We will model these two rates based on the provided information, treating the process as a sequence of probabilistic events.\n\nLet $P_{mismatch}$ be the probability that a mismatch exists after DNA polymerase has completed replication and its own intrinsic proofreading. From the givens, we have:\n$$P_{mismatch} = 1 \\times 10^{-7}$$\n\nLet $E_{MMR}$ be the efficiency of the Mismatch Repair (MMR) system in the wild-type strain. This is the probability that MMR successfully corrects a mismatch it encounters. From the givens:\n$$E_{MMR} = 99.9\\% = 0.999$$\n\nThe probability that the MMR system *fails* to correct a mismatch, denoted $P_{fail, MMR}$, is therefore:\n$$P_{fail, MMR} = 1 - E_{MMR} = 1 - 0.999 = 0.001 = 1 \\times 10^{-3}$$\n\n**1. Mutation Rate in the Wild-Type (WT) Strain ($\\mu_{WT}$)**\n\nIn the wild-type strain, a permanent mutation occurs if and only if two sequential, independent events happen:\n1.  A mismatch is generated and persists after polymerase proofreading (with probability $P_{mismatch}$).\n2.  The MMR system fails to repair this residual mismatch (with probability $P_{fail, MMR}$).\n\nGiven the assumption of independence, the ultimate mutation rate in the wild-type strain, $\\mu_{WT}$, is the product of these probabilities:\n$$\\mu_{WT} = P_{mismatch} \\times P_{fail, MMR}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_{fail, MMR}$:\n$$\\mu_{WT} = P_{mismatch} \\times (1 - E_{MMR})$$\n\n**2. Mutation Rate in the MutS Knockout (MutS⁻) Strain ($\\mu_{MutS^-}$)**\n\nIn the MutS knockout strain, the MMR system is non-functional because the MutS protein, which is required for mismatch recognition, is absent. As stated, \"MMR recognition is abolished and no MMR-mediated correction occurs.\" This means the efficiency of MMR is effectively zero, and thus the probability of MMR failure is one.\n\nConsequently, any mismatch that remains after polymerase proofreading is not subject to this repair pathway and will become a fixed mutation. The ultimate mutation rate in the knockout strain, $\\mu_{MutS^-}$, is therefore equal to the probability of a mismatch persisting after polymerase proofreading:\n$$\\mu_{MutS^-} = P_{mismatch}$$\n\n**3. Fold-Increase in Mutation Rate**\n\nThe fold-increase is the ratio of the mutation rate in the MutS knockout strain to that in the wild-type strain:\n$$\\text{Fold-increase} = \\frac{\\mu_{MutS^-}}{\\mu_{WT}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\mu_{MutS^-}$ and $\\mu_{WT}$:\n$$\\text{Fold-increase} = \\frac{P_{mismatch}}{P_{mismatch} \\times (1 - E_{MMR})}$$\n\nThe term $P_{mismatch}$ cancels out from the numerator and the denominator, demonstrating that the fold-increase is independent of the initial mismatch rate:\n$$\\text{Fold-increase} = \\frac{1}{1 - E_{MMR}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical value for $E_{MMR}$:\n$$\\text{Fold-increase} = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.999} = \\frac{1}{0.001} = \\frac{1}{1 \\times 10^{-3}} = 10^3$$\n\nThus, the fold-increase in the ultimate mutation rate is $1000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1000}$$", "id": "4664945"}, {"introduction": "Horizontal gene transfer via natural transformation is a cornerstone of bacterial evolution, yet it is fundamentally a probabilistic process.

The description of natural transformation, the role of RecA, the distinction between transformants and spontaneous mutants, and the mechanism of action of DNase are all factually correct and fundamental to the field. *Acinetobacter baumannii* is a known naturally competent bacterium, and rifampicin resistance via *rpoB* mutations is a classic model system.

It is calculated as the number of true transformation events (transformants) divided by the total number of viable recipient cells.\n    $$ \\text{Transformation Frequency} = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Transformants}}{\\text{Total Viable Recipient Cells (CFU)}} $$\n2.  **Quantifying True Transformants:** The colonies observed on the selective (rifampicin) plates in the primary experiment ($+DNA$) arise from two sources: true transformants that acquired resistance from the donor DNA, and spontaneous mutants that developed resistance independently. To find the number of true transformants, one must subtract the background of spontaneous mutants.\n3.  **The Role of Controls:**\n    *   **No-DNA Control:** This control measures the frequency of spontaneous mutation to rifampicin resistance under the same experimental conditions (minus the donor DNA). The number of colonies, $12$, is the best estimate for the number of spontaneous mutants present in the main ($+DNA$) experiment.\n    *   **Total Viable Cells (CFU):** Plating on nonselective medium is necessary to determine the size of the total recipient population ($1.2 \\times 10^{8}$ CFU), which is the denominator for the frequency calculation.\n    *   **DNase Controls:** These controls are essential to prove that the observed phenotype is due to the uptake of extracellular DNA (i.e., natural transformation).\n        *   **DNase Pre-Uptake ($t=0$):** Adding DNase at the start of the experiment should degrade the donor DNA before it can be taken up. A successful control will reduce the number of resistant colonies to the background level of spontaneous mutation. Here, the count is $10$, which is very close to the no-DNA control's $12$, confirming the process is DNA-dependent.\n        *   **DNase Post-Uptake ($t=15$ min):** Adding DNase after a sufficient uptake period ($15$ minutes) should not significantly affect the outcome, because the DNA is now inside the cells and protected. The count is $290$, which is very close to the $+DNA$ count of $300$, confirming that uptake and protection occur.\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Number of True Transformants:**\n    $$ \\text{True Transformants} = (\\text{Colonies on Rif with DNA}) - (\\text{Colonies on Rif without DNA}) $$\n    $$ \\text{True Transformants} = 300 - 12 = 288 $$\n    The DNase controls ($10$ and $290$) validate this subtraction by confirming the identity of the two populations.\n\n2.  **Transformation Frequency (per cell):**\n    $$ \\text{Frequency} = \\frac{288}{1.2 \\times 10^{8}} = 2.4 \\times 10^{-6} $$\n\n3.  **Transformation Efficiency (per microgram of DNA):** This is an alternative, but related, metric.\n    $$ \\text{Efficiency} = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Transformants}}{\\text{Mass of DNA}} = \\frac{288}{0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{g}} = 576~\\text{transformants}/\\mu\\mathrm{g} $$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

DNase can be added after plating to eliminate extracellular DNA. Calculate frequency as $300/12$.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option is fundamentally flawed. The ratio $300/12$ is a signal-to-background ratio, not a transformation frequency per cell. Normalizing by antibiotic concentration is incorrect; the concentration is a selective parameter, not a normalization factor. Stating that DNase can be added after plating is incorrect; by then, the transformation process is complete and cells are separated, making the enzyme's action irrelevant.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Define transformation frequency as the number of DNA-dependent rifampicin-resistant colonies per viable recipient cell, computed as the difference between rifampicin colonies with DNA and without DNA, divided by total CFU on nonselective plates; optionally also report per microgram DNA. Include DNase added before DNA exposure to abolish transformation, and DNase added after an uptake interval ($t=15$ minutes) to demonstrate that post-uptake DNase does not affect true transformants; include no-DNA control to measure spontaneous mutants, and nonselective plating to measure CFU. Calculate frequency per cell as $(300-12)/(1.2\\times 10^{8})$, and per microgram DNA as $(300-12)/(0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{g})$.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option is perfectly aligned with the first-principles derivation.\n    *   It correctly defines transformation frequency (transformants per recipient cell).\n    *   It correctly prescribes the calculation: subtract the no-DNA control count ($12$) from the total resistant count ($300$) to find true transformants, then divide by the total CFU ($1.2 \\times 10^{8}$).\n    *   It correctly describes the purpose of all essential controls: the no-DNA control, the nonselective CFU count, the pre-uptake DNase block, and the post-uptake DNase protection.\n    *   It presents the correct mathematical expressions for both frequency per cell and the optional efficiency per microgram of DNA.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**C. Define transformation efficiency solely as transformants per microgram DNA without normalization to recipient CFU, with the only control being heat-denatured DNA. DNase is unnecessary because competence protects DNA immediately. Calculate efficiency as $300/(0.5~\\mu\\mathrm{g})$.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option contains multiple errors. Firstly, it fails to subtract the background of spontaneous mutants in the calculation ($300$ is used instead of $300 - 12$). Secondly, it falsely claims DNase is unnecessary, directly contradicting the experimental data showing DNase at $t=0$ reduces colonies from $300$ to $10$. Competence does not grant immediate protection. Finally, relying solely on a heat-denatured DNA control is insufficient as it doesn't account for spontaneous mutants.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Define transformation frequency as the proportion of colonies that survive rifampicin among those plated on rifampicin alone, with a single DNase addition at $t=50$ minutes to verify DNA degradation. Subtract DNase plate counts from DNA plate counts to obtain frequency: $(300-290)/300$.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option is nonsensical. The definition of frequency is circular and meaningless. The control set is incomplete (missing no-DNA and pre-uptake DNase controls). The calculation $(300-290)/300 = 10/300$ does not represent transformation frequency; it is an uninterpretable ratio derived from a post-uptake control, likely representing the small variability between plating two samples from nearly identical conditions.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4665004"}]}
