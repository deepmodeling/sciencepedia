The institution’s most recent local antibiogram reports that across the prior $12$ months, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was identified as the causative pathogen in a proportion $p$ of HAP cases requiring ICU care, where $p = 0.18$. The ICU routinely performs a nasal Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus polymerase chain reaction (MRSA PCR) as a rapid screening test. For predicting MRSA involvement in HAP, this nasal MRSA PCR has sensitivity $Se = 0.87$ and specificity $Sp = 0.92$ in this setting.\n\nAssume that the antibiogram proportion $p$ is an appropriate estimate of the pretest probability of MRSA involvement for this patient’s HAP episode, that the nasal MRSA PCR performance characteristics ($Se$, $Sp$) are applicable to the target condition of MRSA involvement in HAP, and that observations are representative of the current patient population.
