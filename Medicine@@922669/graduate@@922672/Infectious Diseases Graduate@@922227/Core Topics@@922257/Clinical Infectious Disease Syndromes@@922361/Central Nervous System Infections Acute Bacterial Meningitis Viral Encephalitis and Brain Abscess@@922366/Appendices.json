It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in mathematical biology. Proceeding with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires us to derive an expression for the impact on mortality, $I$, and then calculate its numerical value.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the bacterial growth model. The problem states that the bacterial burden, $B(t)$, expands by binary fission with a constant doubling time, $\\tau_d$. This is the definition of exponential growth. Let $B_0$ be the initial bacterial burden at time $t=0$, so $B(0) = B_0$. The number of doubling periods that have elapsed by time $t$ is given by the ratio $\\frac{t}{\\tau_d}$. Therefore, the bacterial burden at any time $t$ before the administration of antibiotics can be expressed as:\n$$B(t) = B_0 \\cdot 2^{t/\\tau_d}$$\n\nNext, we use the given model for the instantaneous mortality hazard, $h(t)$. It is stated to be proportional to the contemporaneous bacterial burden:\n$$h(t) = \\kappa B(t)$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is a constant of proportionality. This implies that the risk of death at any instant is directly related to the number of bacteria present at that instant.\n\nThe impact on mortality, $I$, is defined as the ratio of the mortality hazard at the time of antibiotic administration, $T$, to the hazard at the initial time, $t=0$:\n$$I \\equiv \\frac{h(T)}{h(0)}$$\n\nWe can substitute the expression for $h(t)$ into this definition. The hazard at time $T$ is $h(T) = \\kappa B(T)$, and the hazard at time $0$ is $h(0) = \\kappa B(0)$. This gives:\n$$I = \\frac{\\kappa B(T)}{\\kappa B(0)}$$\n\nAssuming $\\kappa \\neq 0$ and $B(0) > 0$ (which must be true for a patient with an active infection), the constant of proportionality $\\kappa$ cancels out:\n$$I = \\frac{B(T)}{B(0)}$$\n\nThis result shows that the fold-increase in mortality hazard is equivalent to the fold-increase in the bacterial burden over the delay period $T$.\n\nNow, we substitute the exponential growth formula for $B(t)$ into this expression for $I$:\n$$I = \\frac{B_0 \\cdot 2^{T/\\tau_d}}{B_0}$$\n\nThe initial bacterial burden $B_0$ cancels out, yielding the closed-form expression for $I$ in terms of the delay time $T$ and the doubling time $\\tau_d$:\n$$I = 2^{T/\\tau_d}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $I$ using the given parameters: $T = 2$ hours and $\\tau_d = 40$ minutes. It is critical to ensure the units for $T$ and $\\tau_d$ are consistent before calculating the ratio. We convert $T$ from hours to minutes:\n$$T = 2 \\text{ hours} \\times \\frac{60 \\text{ minutes}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = 120 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nNow we can compute the exponent:\n$$\\frac{T}{\\tau_d} = \\frac{120 \\text{ minutes}}{40 \\text{ minutes}} = 3$$\n\nSubstituting this value into the expression for $I$:\n$$I = 2^3 = 8$$\n\nThus, a $2$-hour delay in antibiotic administration for a meningococcal infection with a $40$-minute doubling time results in an $8$-fold increase in the instantaneous mortality hazard at the moment treatment is initiated, according to this model.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{8}\n$$", "id": "4633297"}]}
