It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, missing information, or violations of physical principles. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to compute the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) using the provided formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ANC} = W \\times \\frac{N\\% + B\\%}{100}\n$$\nThe givens are the percentage of segmented neutrophils, $N\\% = 26$, and the percentage of band forms, $B\\% = 4$.\n\nThe variable $W$ represents the total white blood cell (WBC) count in units of cells per microliter ($\\text{cells}/\\mu\n\\text{L}$). The problem provides the WBC count in units of cells per liter ($\\text{cells}/\\text{L}$). A unit conversion is therefore necessary.\n\nGiven WBC count: $0.42 \\times 10^{9} \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\text{L}}$.\nGiven conversion factor: $1 \\text{ L} = 10^{6} \\mu\\text{L}$.\n\nWe can express this conversion factor as a ratio equal to $1$:\n$$\n\\frac{1 \\text{ L}}{10^{6} \\mu\\text{L}} = 1\n$$\nTo convert the WBC count from $\\text{cells}/\\text{L}$ to $\\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$, we multiply by this ratio to cancel the unit of liters:\n$$\nW = \\left( 0.42 \\times 10^{9} \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\text{L}} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1 \\text{ L}}{10^{6} \\mu\\text{L}} \\right)\n$$\nThe unit 'L' in the numerator and denominator cancels, yielding:\n$$\nW = \\frac{0.42 \\times 10^{9}}{10^{6}} \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\mu\\text{L}}\n$$\nUsing the laws of exponents, $\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$:\n$$\nW = 0.42 \\times 10^{9-6} \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\mu\\text{L}} = 0.42 \\times 10^{3} \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\mu\\text{L}}\n$$\nExpressing this in standard decimal form:\n$$\nW = 420 \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\mu\\text{L}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the values of $W$, $N\\%$, and $B\\%$ into the ANC formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ANC} = 420 \\times \\frac{26 + 4}{100}\n$$\nFirst, we sum the percentages in the numerator:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ANC} = 420 \\times \\frac{30}{100}\n$$\nNext, we perform the division:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ANC} = 420 \\times 0.30\n$$\nFinally, we complete the multiplication:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ANC} = 126\n$$\nThe units for the ANC are cells per microliter. The calculated value is $126$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The number $126$ is composed of the digits $1$, $2$, and $6$, all of which are significant, so it already has exactly three significant figures. No further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe patient's ANC is $126 \\text{ cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$.

It presents a clear, self-contained clinical scenario that is scientifically grounded in the medical fields of oncology and infectious diseases. It asks for the application of a well-established and objective clinical scoring tool, the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) risk index. The provided data are sufficient, consistent, and plausible, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the MASCC risk index score for a specific patient and the subsequent determination of the appropriate care setting (outpatient vs. inpatient).

The score is calculated by summing points assigned based on the presence or absence of seven key clinical features at the time of presentation. A higher score indicates a lower risk.\n\nThe standard MASCC scoring system assigns points as follows:\n*   **Burden of illness:**\n    *   No or mild symptoms: 5 points\n    *   Moderate symptoms: 3 points\n    *   Severe symptoms: 0 points\n*   **No hypotension** (defined as systolic blood pressure $> 90\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$): 5 points\n*   **No Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**: 4 points\n*   **Solid tumor** OR **hematologic malignancy with no previous fungal infection**: 4 points\n*   **No dehydration** requiring parenteral fluids: 3 points\n*   **Outpatient status** at the onset of fever: 3 points\n*   **Age $ 60$ years**: 2 points\n\nWe now evaluate the patient based on the information provided in the problem statement and assign points accordingly.\n1.  **Burden of Illness:** The patient is described as having \"no or mild symptoms\". This attribute corresponds to an award of 5 points.\n2.  **Hypotension:** The patient's systolic blood pressure is $110\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$. Since $110 > 90$, the patient is not hypotensive. This corresponds to an award of 5 points.\n3.  **COPD:** The patient has \"no Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)\". This corresponds to an award of 4 points.\n4.  **Tumor Type/Fungal History:** The patient has a \"solid tumor malignancy\". This condition satisfies the criterion, corresponding to an award of 4 points.\n5.  **Dehydration:** The patient's dehydration is mild and \"does not require parenteral hydration\". This corresponds to an award of 3 points.\n6.  **Outpatient Status:** The patient was an \"outpatient at the onset of fever\". This corresponds to an award of 3 points.\n7.  **Age:** The patient is 54 years old.

The established threshold for the MASCC score is 21. A score of $\\ge 21$ categorizes a patient as low-risk for serious complications from febrile neutropenia. A score of $ 21$ categorizes a patient as high-risk.\n\nThis patient's score is 26, which is $\\ge 21$. Therefore, the patient is classified as low-risk. According to clinical practice guidelines, low-risk patients are often considered eligible for outpatient management with oral antibiotics, assuming appropriate patient monitoring and access to healthcare facilities are available. High-risk patients typically require hospitalization for intravenous antibiotic therapy. Based on the MASCC score, the appropriate management recommendation for this patient would be outpatient care.\n\nThe problem asks for the final MASCC score as an integer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{26}$$", "id": "4642663"}, {"introduction": "Effective management of high-risk febrile neutropenia demands antibiotic therapy optimized through pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) principles. For pathogens like Methicillin-Resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA), vancomycin efficacy is driven by the ratio of the $24$-hour area under the concentration-time curve to the minimum inhibitory concentration ($AUC/MIC$). This advanced problem challenges you to calculate a patient-specific vancomycin dose to achieve a therapeutic target, integrating the critical relationship between drug clearance and renal function to personalize therapy [@problem_id:4642706].", "problem": "A hospitalized adult with high-risk febrile neutropenia presents with persistent fever and hypotension on day one of empiric antipseudomonal therapy. Absolute neutrophil count is $200$ per microliter and an indwelling tunneled central venous catheter is present. The patient is at high risk for Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) due to prior colonization, prompting addition of vancomycin. The MRSA epidemiologic minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distribution at this center has a modal value of $1$ milligram per liter for vancomycin, and the index case’s isolate, when available, is expected to have MIC $= 1$ milligram per liter by broth microdilution. The patient is a $62$-year-old male, body weight $70$ kilograms, with a measured creatinine clearance of $40$ milliliters per minute by timed urine collection.\n\nAssume linear, time-invariant, one-compartment kinetics at steady state. Use an empirically validated renal model for vancomycin in adults whereby total body clearance is proportional to renal function: after unit conversion, total body clearance equals a fraction $\\phi$ of creatinine clearance, with $\\phi = 0.75$. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic driver of efficacy for vancomycin in serious MRSA infections is the $24$-hour area under the concentration–time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration ratio (AUC/MIC), with a target range of $400$ to $600$.\n\nUsing the midpoint of the target AUC/MIC range and MIC $= 1$ milligram per liter, compute the vancomycin total daily maintenance dose that would be expected to achieve the midpoint target at steady state for this patient.

(Note: The monitoring justification will not be part of the final numeric answer.)", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a total daily maintenance dose of vancomycin for a specific patient and a justification for a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) strategy. The solution will proceed in two parts: first, the dose calculation based on pharmacokinetic principles, and second, the clinical-pharmacological reasoning for an appropriate monitoring strategy.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing drug concentration at steady state in a one-compartment model is that the rate of drug administration equals the rate of drug elimination. This leads to the relationship between the total daily dose ($D_{24}$), the total body clearance of the drug (CL), and the area under the concentration-time curve over $24$ hours (AUC$_{24}$):\n$$D_{24} = \\text{CL} \\times \\text{AUC}_{24}$$\n\nThe problem provides the necessary components to solve for $D_{24}$. We must first determine the target AUC$_{24}$ and the patient's specific CL.\n\n**1. Determine the Target AUC$_{24}$**\n\nThe pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index for vancomycin efficacy is the ratio of the $24$-hour area under the curve to the minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC). The target range is given as $400$ to $600$. The problem specifies using the midpoint of this range.\n$$ \\text{Target (AUC/MIC)}_{\\text{midpoint}} = \\frac{400 + 600}{2} = 500 $$\nThe units for this ratio are conventionally treated as dimensionless, but are derived from AUC (units of mass·time/volume, e.g., mg·h/L) and MIC (units of mass/volume, e.g., mg/L), resulting in units of time (h).\n\nThe patient's pathogen is expected to have a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of $1$ milligram per liter.\n$$ \\text{MIC} = 1 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}} $$\nThe target AUC$_{24}$ can now be calculated:\n$$ \\text{Target AUC}_{24} = \\text{Target (AUC/MIC)}_{\\text{midpoint}} \\times \\text{MIC} $$\n$$ \\text{Target AUC}_{24} = 500 \\, \\text{h} \\times 1 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}} = 500 \\frac{\\text{mg} \\cdot \\text{h}}{\\text{L}} $$\n\n**2. Calculate Total Body Clearance (CL)**\n\nThe problem provides a model where vancomycin total body clearance is a fraction, $\\phi = 0.75$, of the patient's creatinine clearance (CrCl).\nThe patient's measured CrCl is $40$ milliliters per minute.\n$$ \\text{CrCl} = 40 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} $$\nFirst, we calculate the clearance in units of mL/min:\n$$ \\text{CL} = \\phi \\times \\text{CrCl} = 0.75 \\times 40 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} = 30 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} $$\nFor consistency with the units of AUC$_{24}$ (mg·h/L), we must convert the units of CL to liters per hour (L/h).\n$$ \\text{CL} = 30 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} \\times \\frac{60 \\, \\text{min}}{1 \\, \\text{h}} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{L}}{1000 \\, \\text{mL}} = 1.8 \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{h}} $$\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Daily Dose ($D_{24}$)**\n\nUsing the steady-state equation, we can now compute the required total daily dose.\n$$ D_{24} = \\text{CL} \\times \\text{AUC}_{24} $$\n$$ D_{24} = \\left( 1.8 \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{h}} \\right) \\times \\left( 500 \\frac{\\text{mg} \\cdot \\text{h}}{\\text{L}} \\right) = 900 \\, \\text{mg} $$\nThis result represents the total dose to be administered over a $24$-hour period, i.e., $900$ mg/day. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures. Expressing $900$ with two significant figures yields $9.0 \\times 10^2$.\n\n**4. Justification for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) Strategy**\n\nThe second part of the problem requires a justification for an appropriate TDM strategy within $48$ hours. This is crucial given the patient's clinical state.\n\n**Necessity of TDM:**\n- **Patient Criticality:** The patient is critically ill with febrile neutropenia and hypotension. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, particularly acute kidney injury (AKI), is common and can cause rapid fluctuations in renal function.\n- **Unstable Renal Function:** The problem explicitly notes \"evolving renal function\". Vancomycin clearance is predominantly dependent on renal function, as described by the model CL $\\propto$ CrCl. Any change in CrCl will directly and proportionally alter drug clearance, making a priori dose calculations based on a single CrCl value unreliable over time.\n- **Narrow Therapeutic Index:** Vancomycin has a narrow therapeutic window.\n    - **Efficacy:** Sub-therapeutic exposure ($\\text{AUC/MIC}  400$) is associated with clinical failure, prolonged infection, and the emergence of microbial resistance. This is unacceptable in a life-threatening infection in an immunocompromised host.\n    - **Toxicity:** Supra-therapeutic exposure (e.g., $\\text{AUC}_{24} > 600-700 \\text{ mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}$) is associated with an increased risk of nephrotoxicity. In a patient with pre-existing renal impairment (CrCl = $40$ mL/min) and hemodynamic instability, further kidney injury is a major concern.\n\n**Proposed TDM Strategy:**\nGiven these factors, waiting for steady state (which would take approximately $4-5$ half-lives, or $>3$ days in this patient) to assess drug exposure is inappropriate and potentially dangerous. An early and sophisticated TDM strategy is warranted.\n\n- **Target Parameter:** The goal is to ensure the AUC$_{24}$ is within the therapeutic range of $400-600$ mg·h/L. Therefore, monitoring should directly estimate the AUC, not rely on trough concentrations alone, as the trough-to-AUC correlation is poor, especially in patients with non-standard pharmacokinetics.\n- **Methodology:** The preferred method for AUC estimation is through **Bayesian pharmacokinetic modeling**. This approach uses population-derived models and integrates patient-specific data (such as age, weight, renal function, and one or more measured drug concentrations) to generate an individualized posterior estimate of the patient's pharmacokinetic parameters (CL and volume of distribution, $V_d$). This allows for an accurate calculation of the true AUC.\n- **Sampling Schedule:** To support a robust Bayesian analysis, two drug concentrations should be obtained within a single dosing interval after the maintenance regimen has begun. An optimal strategy is to collect a post-infusion level ($1-2$ hours after the end of an infusion) and a pre-dose (trough) level.\n- **Timing:** Monitoring should be performed **early**, within $24$ to $48$ hours of initiating therapy. This allows for timely dose adjustment before significant over- or under-exposure occurs. It balances the need for some drug accumulation with the urgency of dose optimization in a critically ill patient with unstable clearance.\n\n**Summary of Strategy:**\n1. Initiate vancomycin with a loading dose (standard of care, though not calculated here) followed by the calculated maintenance regimen (e.g., based on the $900$ mg/day calculation).\n2. Within $24-48$ hours, obtain two vancomycin concentrations (e.g., a post-dose peak and a pre-dose trough).\n3. Use a Bayesian software program to input these levels and other patient data to calculate the patient-specific AUC$_{24}$.\n4. Adjust the vancomycin dose and/or frequency based on the calculated AUC to achieve the target of $400-600$ mg·h/L.\n5. Continue to monitor renal function daily and repeat TDM if there is a significant change in serum creatinine, indicating a change in vancomycin clearance.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{9.0 \\times 10^{2}}\n$$", "id": "4642706"}]}
