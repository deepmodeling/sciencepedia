During a defined outbreak period dominated by primary maternal Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, epidemiologists estimate three parameters aggregated over the full gestational window: the probability of maternal infection during pregnancy is $0.05$, the conditional probability of vertical transmission given maternal infection is $0.4$, and the conditional probability that a vertically infected neonate is symptomatic at birth is $0.1$.

Express your final answer as a single real number representing the count of affected neonates. Do not use a percentage sign. No rounding is required if the exact value is obtained.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in epidemiology and probability theory, well-posed with a unique and stable solution, and expressed in objective, formal language. The data provided are self-contained and consistent, and the required derivation is based on fundamental mathematical principles. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the expected number of neonates born with symptomatic congenital Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in a cohort of $N$ pregnancies. The problem requires the derivation to start from fundamental definitions.\n\nLet $N = 20{,}000$ be the total number of completed pregnancies in the cohort. The problem assumes that the outcomes of the pregnancies are independent and identically distributed events.\n\nFor a single pregnancy, we define the following sequence of events:\n1.  Let $M$ be the event that the mother acquires a primary CMV infection during pregnancy.\n2.  Let $T$ be the event that vertical transmission of the virus from mother to fetus occurs.\n3.  Let $S$ be the event that the neonate is born with symptomatic congenital CMV.\n\nThe problem provides the following probabilities:\n- The probability of maternal infection: $P(M) = 0.05$.\n- The conditional probability of vertical transmission, given maternal infection: $P(T|M) = 0.4$.\n- The conditional probability that a vertically infected neonate is symptomatic at birth. A \"vertically infected neonate\" is one for whom event $T$ has occurred. Thus, this is the conditional probability of $S$ given $T$: $P(S|T) = 0.1$.\n\nFor a neonate to be born with symptomatic congenital CMV (event $S$), vertical transmission must have occurred (event $T$), which in turn requires that the mother was infected during pregnancy (event $M$). This establishes a logical chain of necessary conditions: $S \\implies T \\implies M$. In the language of set theory, this means the event sets are nested: $S \\subseteq T \\subseteq M$.\n\nOur first goal is to calculate the probability, $p_{symptomatic}$, that a single randomly selected neonate from this cohort is born with symptomatic congenital CMV. This is the probability of event $S$, i.e., $p_{symptomatic} = P(S)$.\n\nWe use the chain rule for probabilities, which is derived from the fundamental definition of conditional probability, $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$.\nThe joint probability of the three events is $P(S \\cap T \\cap M)$. Because $S \\subseteq T \\subseteq M$, the intersection of these three events is simply the most specific event, $S$. Therefore, $P(S \\cap T \\cap M) = P(S)$.\n\nUsing the chain rule, we can express this joint probability as:\n$$P(S \\cap T \\cap M) = P(S | T \\cap M) P(T | M) P(M)$$\nSince $T \\subseteq M$, the intersection $T \\cap M$ is identical to the event $T$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$P(S) = P(S | T) P(T | M) P(M)$$\nThis expression gives the overall probability of a neonate being born with symptomatic congenital CMV. We can now substitute the given values:\n$$p_{symptomatic} = P(S) = (0.1) \\times (0.4) \\times (0.05)$$\n$$p_{symptomatic} = 0.04 \\times 0.05 = 0.002$$\nSo, the probability for any single neonate to be symptomatic is $0.002$.\n\nNext, we find the expected total number of symptomatic neonates in the cohort of $N = 20{,}000$ pregnancies. Let $X$ be the random variable representing this total count. To do this, as per the problem instructions, we define an indicator random variable for each pregnancy.\n\nFor each pregnancy $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$, let $X_i$ be an indicator variable such that:\n$$\nX_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if the } i\\text{-th neonate is born with symptomatic congenital CMV} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe total number of symptomatic neonates, $X$, is the sum of these indicator variables:\n$$X = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\nTo find the expected number, we compute the expectation of $X$, $E[X]$. By the linearity of expectation, the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations:\n$$E[X] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\nThe expectation of an indicator variable $X_i$ is, by definition, the probability of the event it indicates:\n$$E[X_i] = (1 \\times P(X_i=1)) + (0 \\times P(X_i=0)) = P(X_i=1)$$\nThe event $X_i=1$ is that the $i$-th neonate is symptomatic. Since the risks are assumed to be identical for all pregnancies, this probability is the same for all $i$ and is equal to the value we calculated earlier:\n$$P(X_i=1) = p_{symptomatic} = 0.002$$\nTherefore, $E[X_i] = 0.002$ for all $i=1, \\dots, N$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the sum for $E[X]$:\n$$E[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_{symptomatic} = N \\times p_{symptomatic}$$\nFinally, we compute the numerical value:\n$$E[X] = 20{,}000 \\times 0.002$$\n$$E[X] = 20{,}000 \\times \\frac{2}{1000} = 20 \\times 2 = 40$$\nThus, the expected number of neonates born with symptomatic congenital CMV in this cohort is $40$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{40}$$", "id": "4635079"}, {"introduction": "Clinical management often involves using multiple interventions simultaneously to reduce risk.

The problem states these are defined as relative risk reduction (RRR).\nWe are given $E_A = 0.5$ and $E_C = 0.85$.\n\nThe relative risk (RR) of an event under a given intervention is the ratio of the probability of the event occurring with the intervention to the probability of it occurring without the intervention (baseline). The effectiveness, or RRR, is related to the relative risk by the formula:\n$$E = RRR = 1 - RR$$\nFrom this, the relative risk can be expressed as:\n$$RR = 1 - E$$\n\nLet $RR_A$ be the relative risk for a patient receiving acyclovir, and $RR_C$ be the relative risk for a patient undergoing a cesarean section.
