The calculation is based on fundamental principles of respiratory physiology, namely Dalton's law of partial pressures and the alveolar gas equation.\n\nFirst, we determine the partial pressure of inspired oxygen ($P_{iO_2}$). As dry atmospheric air is inhaled, it becomes saturated with water vapor at body temperature. According to Dalton's law, the total pressure of this humidified gas mixture is equal to the atmospheric pressure, $P_{atm}$. The pressure exerted by the dry gases (oxygen, nitrogen, etc.) is therefore the atmospheric pressure minus the saturated water vapor partial pressure, $P_{H_2O}$. The partial pressure of inspired oxygen is then the fraction of inspired oxygen, $F_{iO_2}$, multiplied by this corrected pressure.\n\nThe formula for $P_{iO_2}$ is:\n$$P_{iO_2} = F_{iO_2} \\times (P_{atm} - P_{H_2O})$$\n\nThe given values are:\n-   Atmospheric pressure, $P_{atm} = 760 \\text{ mmHg}$\n-   Saturated water vapor pressure at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$, $P_{H_2O} = 47 \\text{ mmHg}$\n-   Fraction of inspired oxygen, $F_{iO_2} = 0.21$\n\nSubstituting these values, we calculate $P_{iO_2}$:\n$$P_{iO_2} = 0.21 \\times (760 \\text{ mmHg} - 47 \\text{ mmHg})$$\n$$P_{iO_2} = 0.21 \\times 713 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n$$P_{iO_2} = 149.73 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen, $P_{A O_2}$, using the alveolar gas equation. This equation describes the balance of oxygen in the alveoli, accounting for the oxygen brought in by inspiration and the oxygen removed by uptake into the blood, which is related to carbon dioxide excretion. A clinically used form of the alveolar gas equation is:\n$$P_{A O_2} = P_{iO_2} - \\frac{P_{A CO_2}}{RQ}$$\nwhere $P_{A CO_2}$ is the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide and $RQ$ is the respiratory quotient, defined as the ratio of carbon dioxide produced to oxygen consumed.\n\nIn clinical practice, it is a valid and standard assumption that the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide ($P_{A CO_2}$) is approximately equal to the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide ($P_{a CO_2}$), because carbon dioxide is a highly diffusible gas. Thus, we can write $P_{A CO_2} \\approx P_{a CO_2}$.\n\nThe problem provides:\n-   Arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, $P_{a CO_2} = 30 \\text{ mmHg}$\n-   Respiratory quotient, $RQ = 0.8$\n\nSubstituting our calculated $P_{iO_2}$ and the given values into the alveolar gas equation:\n$$P_{A O_2} = 149.73 \\text{ mmHg} - \\frac{30 \\text{ mmHg}}{0.8}$$\n$$P_{A O_2} = 149.73 \\text{ mmHg} - 37.5 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n$$P_{A O_2} = 112.23 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the alveolar-arterial ($A\\!-\\!a$) oxygen gradient, which is the difference between the alveolar oxygen partial pressure and the arterial oxygen partial pressure ($P_{a O_2}$). This gradient is a measure of the efficiency of oxygen transfer across the alveolar-capillary membrane. The formula is:\n$$A\\!-\\!a \\text{ gradient} = P_{A O_2} - P_{a O_2}$$\n\nThe problem provides the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, $P_{a O_2} = 55 \\text{ mmHg}$.\n\nSubstituting the values for $P_{A O_2}$ and $P_{a O_2}$:\n$$A\\!-\\!a \\text{ gradient} = 112.23 \\text{ mmHg} - 55 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n$$A\\!-\\!a \\text{ gradient} = 57.23 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$A\\!-\\!a \\text{ gradient} \\approx 57.2 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\nThe clinical scenario mentions a threshold of $A\\!-\\!a > 35 \\text{ mmHg}$ for considering adjunctive systemic corticosteroids in PJP. Our calculated value of $57.2 \\text{ mmHg}$ significantly exceeds this threshold, indicating a severe impairment in gas exchange, which is consistent with the clinical presentation.
