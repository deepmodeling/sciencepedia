I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to correctly classify the patient's condition and determine the appropriate next steps. This requires understanding the formal definition of Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO) and applying principles of good clinical practice.\n\n**1. Definition of Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO)**\n\nThe classical definition of FUO, established by Petersdorf and Beeson in $1961$ and subsequently modified, requires three criteria:\n-   A temperature of $\\geq 38.3^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ ($\\approx 101^\\circ \\mathrm{F}$) on several occasions.\n-   A duration of fever for at least $3$ weeks.\n-   No diagnosis established after a defined period of investigation (e.g., $3$ days in the hospital or $3$ outpatient visits).\n\nThe patient has a fever of $39.2^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$, meeting the temperature criterion. However, the duration of the illness is only $5$ days. This is far short of the required $3$ weeks. Therefore, this case does **not** meet the criteria for classical FUO.\n\nOther subtypes of FUO also do not apply:\n-   **Nosocomial (Healthcare-Associated) FUO**: Requires hospitalization, which this patient has not had.\n-   **Neutropenic FUO**: Requires a neutrophil count $< 500/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. The patient is explicitly stated not to be neutropenic.\n-   **HIV-associated FUO**: Requires a known HIV diagnosis, which this patient does not have.\n\nThe correct classification for this patient's presentation is **acute undifferentiated fever** or **fever without a source**. This term describes a febrile illness of short duration (typically less than $1$ to $2$ weeks) for which a preliminary workup has not revealed a cause. Most such cases are due to self-limiting viral infections.\n\n**2. Management Principles**\n\n-   **Risk Stratification**: The patient is young, previously healthy, immunocompetent, hemodynamically stable, and has a non-focal exam. This places him in a low-risk category.\n-   **Diagnostic and Antimicrobial Stewardship**: For low-risk patients with acute undifferentiated fever, the guiding principles are to avoid both premature, extensive, low-yield testing (\"shotgun\" approach) and the unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The latter can cause side effects, select for resistant organisms, and obscure the diagnostic picture.\n-   **Watchful Waiting**: The appropriate strategy is often \"watchful waiting,\" which involves serial clinical re-evaluation, patient education on warning signs, and targeted, stepwise investigations guided by any new anamnestic clues or physical findings.\n\n**3. Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A. The case meets criteria for classical Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO); initiate broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics and obtain whole-body computed tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography immediately.**\n    -   **FUO Classification**: This is factually incorrect. The illness duration of $5$ days does not meet the $\\geq 3$-week criterion for classical FUO.\n    -   **Management**: Initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics in a stable, immunocompetent patient without evidence of a bacterial source is inappropriate and violates antimicrobial stewardship. Immediate, aggressive imaging with whole-body CT and PET/CT is not indicated for a $5$-day undifferentiated fever in a low-risk patient; this represents poor diagnostic stewardship and is reserved for true, protracted FUO cases.\n    -   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **B. The case does not meet criteria for FUO and is best classified as acute undifferentiated fever (fever without source); perform serial focused re-examinations, repeat basic laboratories in $24$–$48$ hours, and pursue targeted testing guided by epidemiologic risk (for example, Human Immunodeficiency Virus antigen/antibody, repeat blood cultures if fevers persist), while deferring extensive imaging and avoiding empiric antibiotics unless clinical instability or new localizing features emerge.**\n    -   **Classification**: This is correct. The case does not meet FUO criteria and is properly labeled as acute undifferentiated fever.\n    -   **Management**: The proposed strategy is the standard of care. Serial re-examinations and repeating labs constitute \"watchful waiting.\" Pursuing targeted testing (like HIV screening, which is a broad public health recommendation, or repeating cultures) is logical if the fever persists. Deferring imaging and antibiotics in a stable patient is the cornerstone of diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship in this context. This entire approach is medically sound and appropriate.\n    -   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n-   **C. Because the initial workup is negative, noninfectious inflammatory disease such as adult-onset Still disease is most likely; start high-dose glucocorticoids and order ferritin, antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor immediately.**\n    -   **Diagnosis**: Jumping to a diagnosis of a relatively rare noninfectious inflammatory disease (NIID) like Adult-Onset Still Disease (AOSD) after only $5$ days is a significant logical leap. Common self-limited viral illnesses are vastly more probable.\n    -   **Management**: Initiating high-dose glucocorticoids is a high-risk intervention that should not be done without a firm diagnosis or until occult infection has been more thoroughly excluded. Administering steroids could worsen an untreated infection. While ordering a ferritin level may be reasonable if the fever persists for longer, precipitous steroid initiation is dangerous.\n    -   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. Label the case as healthcare-associated Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO) given negative blood cultures; proceed directly to bone marrow biopsy to evaluate for occult hematologic malignancy.**\n    -   **Classification**: This is incorrect. Healthcare-associated (or nosocomial) FUO by definition occurs in a hospitalized patient. This patient is an outpatient.\n    -   **Management**: A bone marrow biopsy is a highly invasive procedure. Recommending it at this very early stage for a stable patient with a near-normal complete blood count is extremely inappropriate and represents a severe deviation from standard practice.\n    -   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **E. The case meets criteria for nosocomial Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO); begin empiric vancomycin plus piperacillin–tazobactam while awaiting further results.**\n    -   **Classification**: This is incorrect for the same reason as option D. The patient is not hospitalized.\n    -   **Management**: This powerful, broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen is indicated for severe infections, often in the hospital setting (e.g., sepsis, neutropenic fever). Its use in this stable, community-dwelling patient would be a gross example of antimicrobial overuse.\n    -   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4626317"}, {"introduction": "In the face of diagnostic uncertainty, a common impulse is to order a broad panel of tests, hoping one will be positive. This practice illuminates the statistical danger of such a \"shotgun\" approach.

Using only the axioms of probability, the definition of independence, and the complement rule, derive the expression for the cumulative false positive risk that at least one of the three independent tests returns a false positive in this disease-free patient. Compute the numerical value and express it as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. Then, briefly justify from first principles how such cumulative risk informs an evidence-based approach to FUO test ordering without invoking any shortcut formulas beyond core probability definitions.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in probability theory and biostatistics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively formulated.\n\nLet $T_i$ be the event that test $i$ returns a positive result, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The patient is known to not have the disease, which we can denote as the condition $D^c$. The problem provides the false positive rate for each test, which is the conditional probability of a positive test given no disease:\n$$\n\\Pr(T_i \\mid D^c) = 0.05 \\quad \\text{for } i=1, 2, 3\n$$\nThe problem states that the tests are conditionally independent given the disease state. We are asked to derive the expression for the cumulative false positive risk, which is the probability that at least one of the three tests returns a positive result. This corresponds to the probability of the union of the events $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$, conditioned on $D^c$. We seek to find $\\Pr(T_1 \\cup T_2 \\cup T_3 \\mid D^c)$.\n\nAs stipulated, we will use only the axioms of probability, the definition of independence, and the complement rule. The most direct path is to calculate the probability of the complementary event and subtract it from $1$. The complement of \"at least one positive test\" is \"no positive tests,\" which means all three tests are negative.\n\nLet $A = T_1 \\cup T_2 \\cup T_3$. The complement rule states:\n$$\n\\Pr(A \\mid D^c) = 1 - \\Pr(A^c \\mid D^c)\n$$\nBy De Morgan's laws, the complement of the union of events is the intersection of their complements:\n$$\nA^c = (T_1 \\cup T_2 \\cup T_3)^c = T_1^c \\cap T_2^c \\cap T_3^c\n$$\nHere, $T_i^c$ is the event that test $i$ returns a negative result. So, we need to calculate the probability that all three tests are negative, given no disease.\n$$\n\\Pr(A \\mid D^c) = 1 - \\Pr(T_1^c \\cap T_2^c \\cap T_3^c \\mid D^c)\n$$\nBecause the tests are conditionally independent given $D^c$, the probability of the intersection of these events is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$\n\\Pr(T_1^c \\cap T_2^c \\cap T_3^c \\mid D^c) = \\Pr(T_1^c \\mid D^c) \\cdot \\Pr(T_2^c \\mid D^c) \\cdot \\Pr(T_3^c \\mid D^c)\n$$\nFor any single test $i$, the probability of a negative result, $\\Pr(T_i^c \\mid D^c)$, can be found using the complement rule on the given false positive rate:\n$$\n\\Pr(T_i^c \\mid D^c) = 1 - \\Pr(T_i \\mid D^c) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95\n$$\nSince this probability is the same for all three tests, we can substitute it into the product expression:\n$$\n\\Pr(T_1^c \\cap T_2^c \\cap T_3^c \\mid D^c) = (0.95) \\cdot (0.95) \\cdot (0.95) = (0.95)^3\n$$\nFinally, substituting this back into our primary expression gives the formula for the cumulative false positive risk:\n$$\n\\Pr(T_1 \\cup T_2 \\cup T_3 \\mid D^c) = 1 - (0.95)^3\n$$\nThis is the derived expression. Now, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n(0.95)^3 = 0.95 \\times 0.95 \\times 0.95 = 0.9025 \\times 0.95 = 0.857375\n$$\nThe cumulative false positive risk is therefore:\n$$\n1 - 0.857375 = 0.142625\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the value is $0.1426$.\n\nThe justification for how this informs an evidence-based approach to FUO test ordering proceeds from these same first principles. An individual test has a false positive rate of $p_{FP} = 0.05$, which may seem acceptably low. This means the probability of a correct negative result for a single test is high, at $1 - p_{FP} = 0.95$. However, when multiple independent tests are ordered simultaneously (a \"shotgun\" approach), the probability that they are *all* correctly negative declines. As derived from the axiom of independence, the probability of three tests all being correctly negative is $(1 - p_{FP})^3 = (0.95)^3 \\approx 0.857$.\n\nThe cumulative risk of at least one false positive is the complement of this event, $1 - (1 - p_{FP})^3 \\approx 0.143$. This risk is nearly three times the risk of a single test. This shows that the probability of a false alarm, which might trigger a cascade of further expensive and potentially invasive procedures on a healthy patient, increases substantially with each additional test ordered. An evidence-based approach, therefore, prioritizes sequential, targeted testing based on evolving clinical evidence and pre-test probabilities, rather than a broad, initial panel. This minimizes the cumulative false positive risk, thereby reducing iatrogenic harm and resource waste. This principle is a direct consequence of the multiplicative nature of probabilities for independent events.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1426}\n$$", "id": "4626364"}, {"introduction": "The goal of a thoughtful FUO investigation is not just to run tests, but to use their results to intelligently narrow the diagnostic possibilities.

A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is performed and shows a mobile oscillating intracardiac mass consistent with a vegetation. For this TEE finding, the positive likelihood ratio ($LR^{+}$) is $9$.\n\nUsing first principles of Bayesian diagnostic reasoning applied to FUO (i.e., starting from the definition of probability, odds, and how likelihood ratios update odds), derive the post-test probability of IE given the positive TEE. Then, using a principled decision framework for FUO that distinguishes the roles of diagnostic tests versus management assessments, briefly justify whether broad further diagnostic testing for alternative FUO etiologies is warranted, or whether the focus should shift to targeted evaluations related to IE. Round your final post-test probability to four significant figures and express it as a decimal (no percentage sign).", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in Bayesian diagnostic reasoning, is well-posed with sufficient data for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, precise clinical language.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part answer: first, the calculation of the post-test probability of infective endocarditis (IE) using first principles; second, a justification for the subsequent diagnostic strategy based on this result.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Post-Test Probability\n\nLet $D$ represent the event that the patient has the disease, in this case, infective endocarditis. Let $D^c$ represent the event that the patient does not have the disease. Let $T$ represent a positive test result, which is the finding of a vegetation on the transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).\n\nThe problem provides the pre-test probability of the disease:\n$$P(D) = 0.20$$\nFrom the axioms of probability, the pre-test probability of not having the disease is:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$$\n\nBayesian reasoning is most elegantly applied using odds rather than probabilities. The odds of an event $A$ are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring:\n$$\\text{Odds}(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{1 - P(A)} = \\frac{P(A)}{P(A^c)}$$\n\nUsing this definition, we can calculate the pre-test odds of having IE:\n$$\\text{Pre-test Odds} = \\text{Odds}(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} = \\frac{0.20}{0.80} = 0.25$$\n\nThe problem provides the positive likelihood ratio ($LR^+$) for the TEE finding, which is a measure of the test's power to increase the certainty of a diagnosis. It is defined as the ratio of the probability of a positive test in a person with the disease (sensitivity) to the probability of a positive test in a person without the disease ($1$ - specificity):\n$$LR^{+} = \\frac{P(T|D)}{P(T|D^c)} = 9$$\n\nWe are asked to find the post-test probability of IE, which is $P(D|T)$, the probability of disease given the positive test result. To do this, we first calculate the post-test odds, $\\text{Odds}(D|T)$.\n\nThe post-test odds are defined as:\n$$\\text{Post-test Odds} = \\text{Odds}(D|T) = \\frac{P(D|T)}{P(D^c|T)}$$\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability (Bayes' theorem), we can express the terms in the numerator and denominator:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)}$$\n$$P(D^c|T) = \\frac{P(T|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T)}$$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for post-test odds:\n$$\\text{Post-test Odds} = \\frac{\\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)}}{\\frac{P(T|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T)}} = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T|D^c)P(D^c)}$$\n\nThis expression can be rearranged to show the fundamental relationship between pre-test odds, post-test odds, and the likelihood ratio:\n$$\\text{Post-test Odds} = \\left(\\frac{P(T|D)}{P(T|D^c)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)}\\right) = LR^{+} \\times \\text{Pre-test Odds}$$\n\nNow we can substitute the given values:\n$$\\text{Post-test Odds} = 9 \\times 0.25 = 2.25$$\n\nFinally, we must convert the post-test odds back into a probability. The relationship between probability $P(A)$ and odds $\\text{Odds}(A)$ is given by:\n$$P(A) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(A)}{1 + \\text{Odds}(A)}$$\n\nApplying this to our post-test odds:\n$$\\text{Post-test Probability} = P(D|T) = \\frac{\\text{Post-test Odds}}{1 + \\text{Post-test Odds}} = \\frac{2.25}{1 + 2.25} = \\frac{2.25}{3.25}$$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{2.25}{3.25} \\approx 0.69230769...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the post-test probability is $0.6923$.\n\nPart 2: Justification of Subsequent Diagnostic Strategy\n\nThe diagnostic process has successfully increased the probability of IE from a pre-test value of $P(D) = 0.20$ (a reasonable possibility) to a post-test value of $P(D|T) \\approx 0.69$ (a high probability). This substantial increase, driven by a powerful diagnostic test (TEE with $LR^+=9$), fundamentally alters the clinical situation.\n\nA principled decision framework for fever of unknown origin (FUO) involves an initial phase of broad investigation when the differential diagnosis is wide and no single etiology is highly probable. The goal is to identify a lead diagnosis. In this case, that phase is now complete. The positive TEE has established IE as the clear leading diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, continuing a broad, unfocused search for alternative FUO etiologies is no longer warranted. Such an approach would be of low yield, resource-intensive, and, most critically, could dangerously delay the management of a life-threatening condition.\n\nThe focus must now pivot from a *broad diagnostic search* to a *targeted evaluation and management plan for IE*. This involves:\n1.  **Confirmation and Characterization:** The pending blood cultures are now of paramount importance. Their results will serve to confirm the diagnosis (by satisfying Duke criteria, for instance) and, crucially, to identify the causative microorganism, which is essential for guiding specific antimicrobial therapy.\n2.  **Assessment of Complications:** IE is a systemic disease. The high probability of its presence mandates a focused search for its sequelae. This includes further imaging to detect embolic events (e.g., to the brain, spleen, or kidneys) and detailed cardiac assessment to quantify valvular destruction and its hemodynamic consequences.\n3.  **Initiation of Management:** Given the high probability ($0.69$) and the seriousness of IE, it is appropriate to consider initiating empiric antibiotic therapy even before blood culture results are finalized. A consultation with cardiothoracic surgery should also be considered early to assess the potential need for surgical intervention.\n\nIn summary, the post-test probability is sufficiently high to declare IE as the working diagnosis. The principles of diagnostic parsimony and effective resource allocation dictate that the broad FUO workup should cease, and all efforts should be redirected to the specific confirmation, characterization, and management of infective endocarditis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6923}$$", "id": "4626375"}]}
