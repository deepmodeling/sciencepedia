Consider a $10\\ \\mathrm{kg}$ toddler assessed to have $0.08$ dehydration.

Ignore ongoing losses and insensible variation beyond the Holliday-Segar estimate, and assume isotonic crystalloid is used for deficit replacement. Express both volumes in $\\mathrm{mL}$ and round each to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of two distinct fluid volumes for a pediatric patient with acute gastroenteritis: the maintenance fluid volume over a $4$-hour period and the fluid deficit volume to be replaced over the same period. We will address each calculation separately based on the provided data and clinical standards.\n\nFirst, we calculate the fluid deficit volume. The patient is a toddler with a current body mass of $W = 10 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$. The clinical assessment indicates a dehydration level of $d = 0.08$, which represents $8\\%$. The problem statement specifies that \"percent dehydration quantifies the fraction of baseline body mass lost as water\". However, in a clinical setting where the pre-illness (baseline) weight is typically unknown, the fluid deficit is pragmatically estimated based on the current (dehydrated) weight. We will follow this standard clinical interpretation.\n\nThe mass of the fluid deficit, $M_{deficit}$, is calculated as the product of the dehydration fraction $d$ and the current body mass $W$:\n$$M_{deficit} = d \\times W = 0.08 \\times 10 \\ \\mathrm{kg} = 0.8 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$$\nThe problem states that the density of water, $\\rho_{water}$, can be approximated as $1 \\ \\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{L}$. The volume of the fluid deficit, $V_{deficit}$, is the deficit mass divided by this density:\n$$V_{deficit} = \\frac{M_{deficit}}{\\rho_{water}} = \\frac{0.8 \\ \\mathrm{kg}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{L}} = 0.8 \\ \\mathrm{L}$$\nTo express this volume in milliliters ($\\mathrm{mL}$), we use the conversion factor $1 \\ \\mathrm{L} = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$:\n$$V_{deficit} = 0.8 \\ \\mathrm{L} \\times 1000 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{L}} = 800 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\nThe problem specifies that this entire deficit is to be replaced over a $4 \\ \\mathrm{h}$ period. Thus, the deficit fluid volume to be administered over $4 \\ \\mathrm{h}$ is $800 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$. Rounding this value to four significant figures gives $800.0 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$.\n\nSecond, we calculate the maintenance fluid volume using the Holliday-Segar method. This method provides the total daily ($24 \\ \\mathrm{h}$) physiological fluid requirement based on body mass. The formula is applied in tiers:\n- For the first $10 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$ of body mass: $100 \\ \\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{day}$.\n- For the next $10 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$ (from $10.1$ to $20 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$): $50 \\ \\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{day}$.\n- For each kilogram above $20 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$: $20 \\ \\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{day}$.\n\nThe patient's mass is $W = 10 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$, which falls entirely within the first tier of the formula. The daily maintenance fluid volume, $V_{maint, 24h}$, is therefore:\n$$V_{maint, 24h} = 100 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{day}} \\times 10 \\ \\mathrm{kg} = 1000 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{day}}$$\nThe problem asks for the maintenance volume required over a time period of $t = 4 \\ \\mathrm{h}$. To find this, we calculate the volume for this fraction of a day. The fraction is $\\frac{4 \\ \\mathrm{h}}{24 \\ \\mathrm{h}} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\nThe maintenance volume over $4 \\ \\mathrm{h}$, $V_{maint, 4h}$, is:\n$$V_{maint, 4h} = V_{maint, 24h} \\times \\frac{t}{24 \\ \\mathrm{h}} = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{mL} \\times \\frac{4}{24} = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{mL} \\times \\frac{1}{6}$$\n$$V_{maint, 4h} = \\frac{500}{3} \\ \\mathrm{mL} \\approx 166.666... \\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures yields $166.7 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$.\n\nThe two required volumes are the $4$-hour maintenance volume and the $4$-hour deficit replacement volume.\nMaintenance volume over $4 \\ \\mathrm{h}$: $166.7 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$.\nDeficit volume over $4 \\ \\mathrm{h}$: $800.0 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 166.7  800.0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4688710"}, {"introduction": "Moving from individual patient care to population health requires tools to measure the impact of interventions like vaccination.

Derivation of the expression for Vaccine Effectiveness (VE).\n\nThe risk, or attack rate ($AR$), is the probability of developing a disease over a specified period.

Consider transmission predominantly within the under-five population, assumed to mix homogeneously. Let the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) of rotavirus in this age stratum be defined as the expected number of secondary infections generated by a single typical index case in a fully susceptible, otherwise identical population, denoted by $R_0$. Let the effective reproduction number ($R_e$) be defined as the expected number of secondary infections generated by a typical case in the current, partially immune population, denoted by $R_e$.\n\nSuppose the vaccine has two independent, multiplicative effects at the individual level under a leaky model: it reduces susceptibility to infection by a factor $\\mathrm{VE}_s$ (so vaccinated individuals have susceptibility multiplied by $1 - \\mathrm{VE}_s$), and it reduces the infectiousness of vaccine-breakthrough infections by a factor $\\mathrm{VE}_i$ (so vaccinated individuals who become infected have infectiousness multiplied by $1 - \\mathrm{VE}_i$).
