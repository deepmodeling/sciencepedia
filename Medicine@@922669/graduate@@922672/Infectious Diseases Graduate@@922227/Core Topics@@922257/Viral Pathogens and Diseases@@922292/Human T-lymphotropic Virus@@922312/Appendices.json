The problem requires the derivation and calculation of a posterior probability using fundamental principles of statistics, specifically Bayes' theorem, applied to a realistic scenario in medical diagnostics.\n\nWe begin by formally defining the events of interest:\nLet $D$ be the event that a randomly selected donor from the specified population is truly infected with HTLV-1.\nLet $D^c$ be the complementary event that the donor is not infected.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the donor's ELISA test result is positive.\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the donor's ELISA test result is negative.\n\nThe information provided in the problem statement can be translated into probabilistic terms as follows:\nThe baseline prevalence of the disease is given as $P(D) = P = 3.5 \\times 10^{-4}$.\nThe probability that a donor is not infected is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - P$.\nThe sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive result given that the donor has the disease: $Se = P(T^+ | D) = 0.996$.\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of a negative result given that the donor does not have the disease: $Sp = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.9993$.\n\nThe quantity to be determined is the posterior probability of a true infection given a positive screening result, which is denoted as $P(D | T^+)$. This is also known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of the test.\n\nWe employ Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T^+)$, represents the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, which allows us to sum over the mutually exclusive and exhaustive events $D$ and $D^c$:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can expand this expression:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nWe have been given $P(T^+ | D) = Se$ and $P(D) = P$. We also have $P(D^c) = 1 - P$. The term $P(T^+ | D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given the donor is not infected (a false positive). This can be derived from the specificity, $Sp$. Since a test result can only be positive or negative for a non-infected individual, we have:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) + P(T^- | D^c) = 1$$\nThus, the false positive rate is:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp$$\nSubstituting these terms back into the expression for $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se \\cdot P) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P))$$\nNow, we substitute this full expression for $P(T^+)$ into the denominator of Bayes' theorem to obtain the required analytical expression for the posterior probability $P(D | T^+)$:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}$$\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{Se \\cdot P}{Se \\cdot P + (1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P)}$$\nThis is the derived analytic expression for the posterior probability of true infection given a positive result.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided parameter values:\n$P = 3.5 \\times 10^{-4}$\n$Se = 0.996$\n$Sp = 0.9993$\n\nFirst, we calculate the components of the formula:\nThe term $1 - Sp$ is $1 - 0.9993 = 0.0007$.\nThe term $1 - P$ is $1 - 3.5 \\times 10^{-4} = 1 - 0.00035 = 0.99965$.\n\nNow, we calculate the numerator and denominator:\nNumerator = $Se \\cdot P = 0.996 \\times (3.5 \\times 10^{-4}) = 0.0003486$.\nDenominator = $(Se \\cdot P) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P))$\nDenominator = $0.0003486 + (0.0007 \\times 0.99965)$\nDenominator = $0.0003486 + 0.000699755$\nDenominator = $0.001048355$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{0.0003486}{0.001048355} \\approx 0.332517808$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

We may proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe objective is twofold: first, to derive from first principles an expression for the HTLV-1 proviral load per $100$ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and second, to apply this expression to a given set of data.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the quantities measured by digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR):\n- Let $N_{HTLV}$ be the absolute number of HTLV-1 proviral gene copies detected.\n- Let $N_{REF}$ be the absolute number of reference gene copies (in this case, $\\beta$-globin) detected.\n\nThe first task is to define \"cell equivalents\" in terms of the measured reference gene copies. The problem states that PBMC are diploid and that the reference gene is an autosomal single-copy locus. By definition, a diploid cell contains two full sets of autosomes. Therefore, a single diploid cell contains exactly $2$ copies of any single-copy autosomal gene.\n\nLet $N_{CE}$ denote the number of cell equivalents in the sample. A cell equivalent is defined as the count of diploid genomes. Since each diploid genome, and thus each cell, contains $2$ copies of the reference gene, the total number of measured reference gene copies, $N_{REF}$, is related to the number of cell equivalents by the equation:\n$$N_{REF} = 2 \\times N_{CE}$$\nFrom this relationship, we can express the number of cell equivalents as a function of the measured reference gene copies:\n$$N_{CE} = \\frac{N_{REF}}{2}$$\nThis equation provides the formal definition of cell equivalents based on the ddPCR measurement of the reference gene.\n\nThe second task is to derive an expression for the HTLV-1 proviral load per $100$ PBMC. The proviral load is a measure of the average number of viral copies per cell. We can first calculate the load per single cell, which we denote as $L_{cell}$. This is the ratio of the total number of viral copies to the total number of cell equivalents:\n$$L_{cell} = \\frac{N_{HTLV}}{N_{CE}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{CE}$ that we derived above:\n$$L_{cell} = \\frac{N_{HTLV}}{\\frac{N_{REF}}{2}} = 2 \\frac{N_{HTLV}}{N_{REF}}$$\nThis expression gives the average number of HTLV-1 proviral copies per single cell. Clinical reporting standards often require this value to be expressed per $100$ cells. Let us denote the proviral load per $100$ PBMC as $L_{100}$. This is simply $100$ times the load per cell:\n$$L_{100} = 100 \\times L_{cell}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $L_{cell}$:\n$$L_{100} = 100 \\times \\left( 2 \\frac{N_{HTLV}}{N_{REF}} \\right) = 200 \\frac{N_{HTLV}}{N_{REF}}$$\nThis is the final derived expression for the HTLV-1 proviral load per $100$ PBMC as a function of the measured copies of the HTLV-1 target and the autosomal reference gene.\n\nNow, we apply this expression to the provided data:\n- Measured HTLV-1 target copies, $N_{HTLV} = 1,780$.\n- Measured $\\beta$-globin copies, $N_{REF} = 42,500$.\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula for $L_{100}$:\n$$L_{100} = 200 \\times \\frac{1,780}{42,500}$$\nWe can simplify the expression before performing the division:\n$$L_{100} = \\frac{200 \\times 1,780}{42,500} = \\frac{2 \\times 17,800}{4,250} = \\frac{2 \\times 1,780}{425}$$\n$$L_{100} = \\frac{3,560}{425}$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$L_{100} \\approx 8.376470588...$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
