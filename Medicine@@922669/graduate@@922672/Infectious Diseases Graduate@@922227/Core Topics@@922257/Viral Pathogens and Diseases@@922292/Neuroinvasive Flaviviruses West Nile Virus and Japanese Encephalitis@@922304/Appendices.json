This practice [@problem_id:4673402] challenges you to deconstruct the classic Ross-Macdonald model for $R_0$, forcing a mechanistic interpretation of each parameter and clarifying why the primary transmission cycle is enzootic.", "problem": "A West Nile virus (WNV) or Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission system can be idealized using the Ross–Macdonald framework, in which mosquitoes act as vectors and vertebrate amplifying hosts sustain the infection cycle. West Nile virus (WNV) primarily amplifies in birds, and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) primarily amplifies in pigs; in both systems, humans are generally dead-end hosts because human viremia is insufficient to infect vectors. The basic reproduction number (BRN), denoted as $R_0$, is defined as the expected number of secondary amplifying-host infections generated by a single infectious amplifying host introduced into a fully susceptible system.\n\nUse the following foundational, well-tested facts to reason about the structure of $R_0$ and the interpretation of its parameters in the WNV/JEV contexts:\n- A mosquito that survives each day with probability $p$ has probability $p^n$ to survive an extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of $n$ days, and its per-day instantaneous mortality rate is $\\mu$ satisfying $p = e^{-\\mu}$, so $\\mu = -\\ln p$.\n- A mosquito bites at rate $a$ bites per mosquito per day, and there are $m$ mosquitoes per amplifying host on average.\n- The probability that an infectious mosquito transmits infection to a susceptible amplifying host per bite is $b$ (vector-to-host), and the probability that an infectious amplifying host transmits infection to a susceptible mosquito per bite is $c$ (host-to-vector).\n- An amplifying host clears viremia or otherwise ceases to be infectious at rate $r$ per day, with mean infectious period $1/r$.\n\nUnder the Ross–Macdonald modeling assumptions and the definition of $R_0$ given above, choose the option that correctly provides the expression for $R_0$ and correctly interprets each parameter in the specific transmission contexts of WNV and JEV.\n\nA. $R_0 = \\dfrac{m a^2 b c p^n}{r(-\\ln p)}$.

This $R_0$ applies to both the enzootic cycle and sustained human transmission.", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in mathematical epidemiology. It provides a clear definition of the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) in the context of a vector-borne disease and supplies all necessary parameters and relationships based on the standard Ross-Macdonald framework. The biological context for West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is factually correct. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no internal contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe derivation of the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, proceeds by tracking the full transmission cycle from a single primary infectious amplifying host to subsequent secondary amplifying hosts. $R_0$ is defined as the expected number of secondary amplifying-host infections generated by a single ($1$) infectious amplifying host introduced into a fully susceptible system. We can calculate this by determining the product of (i) the total number of mosquitoes that become infected from a single infectious host, and (ii) the expected number of new host infections caused by each of those newly infected mosquitoes.\n\n**Step 1: Number of mosquitoes infected by a single infectious host.**\n- An amplifying host is infectious for an average period of $1/r$ days.\n- There are, on average, $m$ mosquitoes per host.\n- Each mosquito bites at a rate of $a$ bites per day. Thus, the host is bitten at a total rate of $m \\cdot a$ bites per day.\n- The probability of transmission from the infectious host to a susceptible mosquito during a bite is $c$.\n- The rate at which a single infectious host infects new mosquitoes is the product of these terms: $m \\cdot a \\cdot c$ new mosquito infections per day.\n- To find the total number of mosquitoes infected by this host over its entire infectious period, we multiply this rate by the average duration of the infectious period:\n  $$ \\text{Total mosquitoes infected per host} = (m \\cdot a \\cdot c) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) = \\frac{mac}{r} $$\n\n**Step 2: Expected number of secondary host infections caused by a single newly infected mosquito.**\n- Once a mosquito is infected, it is not immediately infectious. The virus must undergo an extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of $n$ days.\n- The mosquito must survive this period. Given a daily survival probability of $p$, the probability of surviving for $n$ days is $p^n$.\n- If the mosquito survives the EIP, it becomes infectious for the remainder of its life.\n- The problem states the mosquito's daily survival probability is $p = e^{-\\mu}$, where $\\mu$ is the instantaneous mortality rate. Therefore, $\\mu = -\\ln p$. This rate is assumed constant.\n- The life expectancy of an infectious mosquito is the reciprocal of its mortality rate, which is $1/\\mu = 1/(-\\ln p)$ days.\n- During its infectious lifespan, the mosquito bites susceptible hosts at a rate of $a$ bites per day.\n- The probability of transmission from the infectious mosquito to a susceptible host per bite is $b$.\n- The rate at which an infectious mosquito infects new hosts is $a \\cdot b$.\n- The total number of new hosts an infectious mosquito is expected to infect during its remaining lifetime is the product of this rate and its infectious lifespan:\n  $$ \\text{Hosts infected per infectious mosquito} = (a \\cdot b) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{-\\ln p}\\right) = \\frac{ab}{-\\ln p} $$\n- The quantity above is conditional on the mosquito having survived the EIP. To find the unconditional expected number of secondary infections from any single newly infected mosquito, we must multiply by the probability of surviving the EIP:\n  $$ \\text{Expected hosts infected per newly infected mosquito} = p^n \\times \\frac{ab}{-\\ln p} $$\n\n**Step 3: Calculating $R_0$.**\n$R_0$ is the total number of secondary host infections originating from the single primary host. We multiply the total number of mosquitoes it infects (from Step 1) by the expected number of secondary hosts each of those mosquitoes goes on to infect (from Step 2).\n$$ R_0 = \\left( \\frac{mac}{r} \\right) \\times \\left( p^n \\frac{ab}{-\\ln p} \\right) $$\nCombining terms gives the final expression for the basic reproduction number:\n$$ R_0 = \\frac{m a^2 b c p^n}{r(-\\ln p)} $$\n\nNow, we evaluate each of the given options based on this derived formula and the problem statement.\n\n**A. $R_0 = \\dfrac{m a^2 b c p^n}{r(-\\ln p)}$. Here, $m$ is the mosquito density per amplifying host (birds for WNV; pigs for JEV), $a$ is bites per mosquito per day, $b$ is the probability that an infectious mosquito infects a susceptible amplifying host per bite, $c$ is the probability that an infectious amplifying host infects a susceptible mosquito per bite (near zero for humans), $p$ is the daily survival probability of the mosquito, $n$ is the extrinsic incubation period in days, $r$ is the recovery or viral clearance rate in amplifying hosts, and $-\\ln p$ is the mosquito’s per-day instantaneous mortality rate. The $R_0$ so defined pertains to the enzootic/amplifying cycle and does not imply sustained human-to-mosquito transmission.**\n\n- **Formula**: The expression $\\dfrac{m a^2 b c p^n}{r(-\\ln p)}$ matches our derivation exactly.\n- **Parameter Interpretation**:\n  - $m$, $a$, $b$, $c$, $p$, $n$, and $r$ are all interpreted correctly according to the standard Ross-Macdonald model and the specifics of WNV/JEV biology.\n  - The interpretation of $-\\ln p$ as the mosquito's mortality rate $\\mu$ is correct as per the problem statement ($p=e^{-\\mu}$).\n  - The final statement clarifying that this $R_0$ pertains to the enzootic cycle (in birds or pigs) and not sustained human transmission is also correct. Humans are dead-end hosts, meaning the value of $c$ for humans, $c_{human}$, is approximately $0$. An $R_0$ for a human-mosquito-human cycle would contain $c_{human}$ and thus be near $0$, precluding sustained transmission.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $R_0 = \\dfrac{m a^2 b c p^n}{r(1-p)}$. Here, $1-p$ is taken as the mosquito’s per-day mortality rate, $n$ is the extrinsic incubation period, and $r$ is the mosquito’s recovery rate; the remaining parameters are as in Option A. This $R_0$ applies equally to human outbreaks for WNV and JEV.**\n\n- **Formula**: This expression uses $1-p$ in the denominator instead of $-\\ln p$. While $1-p$ can be an approximation for $\\mu$ when $\\mu$ is small (since $-\\ln p = -\\ln(1-(1-p)) \\approx 1-p$), the problem explicitly defines the relationship as $p = e^{-\\mu}$, which makes $\\mu = -\\ln p$ the exact expression. Using the approximation is incorrect given the provided definitions.\n- **Parameter Interpretation**: It incorrectly identifies $r$ as the mosquito's recovery rate. The problem defines $r$ as the host's recovery rate. Mosquitoes, once infectious with an arbovirus, are generally considered infectious for life and do not recover.\n- **Context**: The claim that this $R_0$ applies equally to human outbreaks is false, as humans are dead-end hosts.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $R_0 = \\dfrac{m a^2 b c p^{n}}{r(-\\ln p)}$. The symbol $c$ denotes overall mosquito species “vector competence,” $r$ is the mosquito’s recovery rate, and $m$ is mosquitoes per human; the remaining parameters are as in Option A. This $R_0$ directly characterizes sustained human transmission for WNV and JEV.**\n\n- **Formula**: The mathematical expression is correct.\n- **Parameter Interpretation**: The interpretation of the parameters is flawed.\n  - $c$ is specifically the host-to-vector transmission probability per bite, not the overall \"vector competence\". Vector competence is a broader term, often represented by the composite term $bc$ (the ability to acquire and then transmit an infection).\n  - $r$ is incorrectly identified as the mosquito's recovery rate, when it is the host's recovery rate.\n  - $m$ is incorrectly defined as mosquitoes per human. For the main transmission cycle, $m$ must be the density of mosquitoes relative to the amplifying hosts (birds/pigs).\n- **Context**: The statement that this $R_0$ characterizes sustained human transmission is false.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $R_0 = \\dfrac{m a b c p^n}{r(-\\ln p)}$. Here, only a single factor of $a$ is included, $n$ is the intrinsic incubation period in the amplifying host, and $m$ is defined per human; the remaining parameters are as in Option A. This $R_0$ pertains to the enzootic cycle.**\n\n- **Formula**: The formula is missing a factor of $a$; it should be $a^2$. One factor of $a$ comes from the host being bitten, and the second comes from the infected mosquito biting new hosts.\n- **Parameter Interpretation**:\n  - It incorrectly identifies $n$ as the *intrinsic* incubation period (in the host). The model uses $n$ as the *extrinsic* incubation period (in the mosquito).\n  - It incorrectly defines $m$ per human.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. $R_0 = \\dfrac{m a^2 b c e^{-n/r}}{r(-\\ln p)}$. Here, $e^{-n/r}$ is used for survival through the extrinsic incubation period, $r$ is the amplifying host recovery rate, and the remaining parameters are as in Option A. This $R_0$ applies to both the enzootic cycle and sustained human transmission.**\n\n- **Formula**: The term for mosquito survival through the EIP is given as $e^{-n/r}$, which is incorrect. The correct term is $p^n = (e^{-\\mu})^n = e^{-n\\mu}$. The expression $e^{-n/r}$ incorrectly uses the host recovery rate $r$ in the mosquito survival probability.\n- **Context**: The claim that this $R_0$ applies to sustained human transmission is false.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only option A provides both the correct formula and the correct interpretation of all its components in the specified biological context.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4673402"}, {"introduction": "While understanding the enzootic cycle is key, the primary public health concern is the spillover of flaviviruses into human populations.

All necessary data are provided, and the requested calculation is a standard application of fundamental principles in probability theory and epidemiology. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nLet $N$ be the size of the closed community, with $N = 100{,}000$.\nLet $p_{inf}$ be the probability that a randomly selected individual in the community becomes infected with West Nile virus (WNV) during the transmission season. The problem states a community-wide seroconversion rate of $0.05$ and specifies that seroconversion corresponds to incident infection. Therefore, we have:\n$$p_{inf} = 0.05 = \\frac{5}{100} = \\frac{1}{20}$$\n\nLet $p_{WNND|inf}$ be the conditional probability that an infected individual develops West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND). The problem provides this value as:\n$$p_{WNND|inf} = \\frac{1}{150}$$\n\nOur goal is to find the expected number of WNND cases in the community. To do this, we first calculate the unconditional probability, $p_{WNND}$, that any given individual in the community develops WNND. An individual develops WNND if and only if they are first infected and then, conditional on being infected, they progress to neuroinvasive disease. As per the problem's constraint, we use the multiplication rule for probabilities, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, where event $B$ is \"being infected\" and event $A$ is \"developing WNDD\".\nThe probability $p_{WNND}$ is thus the product of the probability of infection and the conditional probability of developing WNND given infection:\n$$p_{WNND} = p_{WNND|inf} \\times p_{inf}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$p_{WNND} = \\frac{1}{150} \\times \\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{1}{3000}$$\n\nNow, we must compute the expected number of WNND cases in the total population of size $N$.

Therefore, the expected value of $X_i$ is:\n$$E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i=0) = P(X_i=1) = p_{WNND}$$\n\nThe total number of WNND cases in the community, which we can denote as $X_{total}$, is the sum of these individual indicator variables:\n$$X_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\nTo find the expected total number of cases, $E[X_{total}]$, we use the property of linearity of expectation, as specified in the problem statement. The expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations. This holds true regardless of whether the random variables are independent.\n$$E[X_{total}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\nSince $E[X_i] = p_{WNND}$ for all $i$ from $1$ to $N$, the sum becomes:\n$$E[X_{total}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_{WNND} = N \\times p_{WNND}$$\nWe can now substitute the given values for $N$ and the calculated value for $p_{WNND}$ to find the final answer.\n$$E[X_{total}] = 100{,}000 \\times \\frac{1}{3000}$$\n$$E[X_{total}] = \\frac{100{,}000}{3000} = \\frac{100}{3}$$\nThe expected number of WNND cases is $\\frac{100}{3}$.
