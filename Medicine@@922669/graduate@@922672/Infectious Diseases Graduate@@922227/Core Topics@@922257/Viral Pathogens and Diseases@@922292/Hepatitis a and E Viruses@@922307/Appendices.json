Understanding this principle is fundamental to interpreting test results correctly, especially in low-prevalence settings for viruses like HEV where false positives can be surprisingly common.

This is denoted as $\\mathbb{P}(D \\mid T^{+})$.\n\nWe begin with the definition of conditional probability, which can be rearranged into the form known as Bayes’ theorem:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(D \\cap T^{+})}{\\mathbb{P}(T^{+})}\n$$\nThe numerator, $\\mathbb{P}(D \\cap T^{+})$, is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. Using the definition of conditional probability again, we can express this term as:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(D \\cap T^{+}) = \\mathbb{P}(T^{+} \\mid D) \\mathbb{P}(D)\n$$\nThe problem provides the following definitions:\n1.  Sensitivity: $Se = \\mathbb{P}(T^{+} \\mid D)$\n2.  Prevalence: $\\pi = \\mathbb{P}(D)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for the numerator gives:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(D \\cap T^{+}) = Se \\cdot \\pi\n$$\nNext, we must evaluate the denominator, $\\mathbb{P}(T^{+})$, which is the overall probability of a positive test result in the screened population. To do this, we apply the law of total probability. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: a patient has the disease and tests positive (a true positive), or a patient does not have the disease and tests positive (a false positive). We can write this as:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(T^{+}) = \\mathbb{P}(T^{+} \\cap D) + \\mathbb{P}(T^{+} \\cap \\neg D)\n$$\nwhere $\\neg D$ represents the absence of the disease. Using the definition of conditional probability for each term:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(T^{+}) = \\mathbb{P}(T^{+} \\mid D)\\mathbb{P}(D) + \\mathbb{P}(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D)\\mathbb{P}(\\neg D)\n$$\nWe can substitute the given variables into this expression. We already have $\\mathbb{P}(T^{+} \\mid D) = Se$ and $\\mathbb{P}(D) = \\pi$. The probability of not having the disease is $\\mathbb{P}(\\neg D) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(D) = 1 - \\pi$.\n\nThe remaining term is $\\mathbb{P}(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D)$, the probability of a positive test in an uninfected individual (the false positive rate). The problem provides the specificity, $Sp = \\mathbb{P}(T^{-} \\mid \\neg D)$, which is the probability of a negative test ($T^{-}$) in an uninfected individual. Since for any given condition, the test result must be either positive or negative, the probabilities sum to $1$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D) + \\mathbb{P}(T^{-} \\mid \\neg D) = 1\n$$\nSolving for the false positive rate gives:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(T^{-} \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - Sp\n$$\nNow we can substitute all the components back into the expression for $\\mathbb{P}(T^{+})$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(T^{+}) = (Se)(\\pi) + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for the numerator, $\\mathbb{P}(D \\cap T^{+})$, and the denominator, $\\mathbb{P}(T^{+})$, back into the original Bayes' theorem formula for the PPV:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{Se \\cdot \\pi}{Se \\cdot \\pi + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the Positive Predictive Value in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence.\n\nRegarding the implications for confirmatory testing, this formula demonstrates a critical principle of diagnostic screening in low-prevalence settings ($\\pi \\ll 1$). In such a scenario, the prevalence $\\pi$ is a very small number, which makes the numerator, $Se \\cdot \\pi$ (the proportion of true positives), also very small. The denominator consists of the true positives ($Se \\cdot \\pi$) and the false positives ($(1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)$). As $\\pi \\to 0$, the term $(1 - \\pi) \\to 1$. Thus, the denominator is dominated by the false positive term $(1 - Sp)$. Even for an assay with high specificity (e.g., $Sp = 0.99$), the false positive rate ($1 - Sp = 0.01$) is a non-zero value. When this rate is applied to the very large population of individuals without the disease ($1 - \\pi$), the absolute number of false positives can be comparable to, or even much larger than, the absolute number of true positives. Consequently, the ratio, which is the PPV, can be surprisingly low. This means that a single positive test result has a low probability of representing a true infection. Therefore, it is standard practice in such contexts to implement a confirmatory testing strategy. A positive result from a first-line screening assay (like an IgM test) must be followed by a second, typically more specific, test (such as a nucleic acid amplification test, NAAT) to rule out false positives and confirm the diagnosis of an active infection.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{Se \\, \\pi}{Se \\, \\pi + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)}}\n$$", "id": "4648325"}, {"introduction": "Quantifying the effectiveness of an antiviral therapy is a cornerstone of clinical virology.
