Cells are inoculated with each virus at an identical multiplicity of infection (MOI; mean virions per cell) of $0.2$ for a single replication cycle. The lysosomotropic agent is a weak base that accumulates in and neutralizes acidic endosomes and lysosomes by raising their $pH$ without altering the plasma membrane $pH$; at the concentration used, cell viability and the per-cell infectious yield are unaffected.\n\nAssume the following experimentally established and widely accepted base facts:\n\n- Paramyxoviruses (MeV, MuV) execute receptor-triggered membrane fusion at the plasma membrane at approximately neutral $pH$ and do not require endosomal acidification to trigger their fusion protein.\n- Rubella virus (RuV) is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and its class II fusion protein (E1) requires low endosomal $pH$ to undergo the fusogenic conformational change that drives endosomal escape.\n- Lysosomotropic weak bases raise endosomal $pH$ by dissipating the vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase)-generated gradient and thereby block $pH$-dependent viral fusion steps in endosomes, while not directly affecting neutral $pH$ plasma membrane fusion.\n- At a given $MOI$, if each virion has an independent probability $f$ of executing the minimal sequence of early events to establish infection (attachment, entry, and uncoating), then the number of virions entering a given cell follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda'=\\lambda f$, where $\\lambda$ is the applied $MOI$.

RuV total PFU decreases by approximately $37$-fold, whereas MeV and MuV PFU are essentially unchanged (less than $1.1$-fold difference), because RuV requires low endosomal $pH$ to trigger E1-mediated fusion and endosomal escape, while MeV and MuV fuse at the plasma membrane at neutral $pH$ via a $pH$-independent fusion mechanism.\n\nB. All three viruses show a similar multi-log decrease in PFU because all enveloped viruses require endosomal acidification to fuse and uncoat; the lysosomotropic agent neutralizes endosomes for all three.\n\nC.

The described entry mechanisms for Paramyxoviridae (measles, mumps) and Matonaviridae (rubella) are factually correct and represent canonical examples of pH-independent plasma membrane fusion and pH-dependent endosomal fusion, respectively.

The Poisson model is the standard mathematical description for such infection processes. The given probabilities ($f$) and their response to the drug are plausible.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution can be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe total PFU yield is stated to be proportional to the number of infected cells multiplied by the per-infected-cell yield, $Y$. The number of infected cells is the total number of cells, $N$, multiplied by the fraction of infected cells, $\\phi$.\n$$\n\\text{Total PFU} = k \\cdot N \\cdot \\phi \\cdot Y\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a proportionality constant. Since $k$, $N$, and $Y$ are stated to be constant across the experimental conditions (control vs. drug), the fold change in total PFU upon addition of the drug is determined solely by the ratio of the fraction of infected cells, $\\phi$.\n\n$$\n\\text{Fold Change} = \\frac{\\text{Total PFU}_{\\text{drug}}}{\\text{Total PFU}_{\\text{no\\_drug}}} = \\frac{k \\cdot N \\cdot \\phi_{\\text{drug}} \\cdot Y}{k \\cdot N \\cdot \\phi_{\\text{no\\_drug}} \\cdot Y} = \\frac{\\phi_{\\text{drug}}}{\\phi_{\\text{no\\_drug}}}\n$$\n\nThe fraction of infected cells, $\\phi$, is given by the formula $\\phi = 1 - e^{-\\lambda f}$, where $\\lambda$ is the MOI and $f$ is the entry-success probability. We can now calculate the fold change for each virus.\n\n**1. Rubella Virus (RuV)**\n- MOI: $\\lambda = 0.2$\n- Success probability without drug: $f_{\\mathrm{RuV, no\\_drug}} = 0.80$\n- Success probability with drug: $f_{\\mathrm{RuV, drug}} = 0.02$\n\nThe effective MOI for successful infection is $\\lambda' = \\lambda f$.\n- Without drug: $\\lambda'_{\\text{no\\_drug}} = 0.2 \\times 0.80 = 0.16$\n- With drug: $\\lambda'_{\\text{drug}} = 0.2 \\times 0.02 = 0.004$\n\nNow, we calculate the fraction of infected cells in each condition:\n- $\\phi_{\\text{no\\_drug}} = 1 - e^{-\\lambda'_{\\text{no\\_drug}}} = 1 - e^{-0.16} \\approx 1 - 0.85214 = 0.14786$\n- $\\phi_{\\text{drug}} = 1 - e^{-\\lambda'_{\\text{drug}}} = 1 - e^{-0.004} \\approx 1 - 0.996008 = 0.003992$\n\nThe fold change for RuV is:\n$$\n\\text{Fold Change}_{\\text{RuV}} = \\frac{\\phi_{\\text{drug}}}{\\phi_{\\text{no\\_drug}}} \\approx \\frac{0.003992}{0.14786} \\approx 0.0270\n$$\nThe question asks for the fold **decrease**, which is the reciprocal of the fold change:\n$$\n\\text{Fold Decrease}_{\\text{RuV}} = \\frac{1}{0.0270} \\approx 37.0\n$$\nThus, the total PFU for RuV is expected to decrease by approximately $37$-fold.\n\n**2. Measles Virus (MeV)**\n- MOI: $\\lambda = 0.2$\n- Success probability without drug: $f_{\\mathrm{MeV, no\\_drug}} = 0.90$\n- Success probability with drug: $f_{\\mathrm{MeV, drug}} = 0.90$\nSince $f_{\\text{drug}} = f_{\\text{no\\_drug}}$, it is immediately obvious that $\\phi_{\\text{drug}} = \\phi_{\\text{no\\_drug}}$.\n$$\n\\text{Fold Change}_{\\text{MeV}} = \\frac{\\phi_{\\text{drug}}}{\\phi_{\\text{no\\_drug}}} = 1\n$$\nThere is no change in PFU for MeV. A $1$-fold change represents no difference, which is well within \"less than $1.1$-fold difference\".\n\n**3. Mumps Virus (MuV)**\n- MOI: $\\lambda = 0.2$\n- Success probability without drug: $f_{\\mathrm{MuV, no\\_drug}} = 0.85$\n- Success probability with drug: $f_{\\mathrm{MuV, drug}} = 0.85$\nSimilar to MeV, $f_{\\text{drug}} = f_{\\text{no\\_drug}}$, so $\\phi_{\\text{drug}} = \\phi_{\\text{no\\_drug}}$.\n$$\n\\text{Fold Change}_{\\text{MuV}} = \\frac{\\phi_{\\text{drug}}}{\\phi_{\\text{no\\_drug}}} = 1\n$$\nThere is no change in PFU for MuV, which is also \"less than $1.1$-fold difference\".\n\n**Mechanistic Justification**\nThe differential effect of the drug is explained by the distinct entry mechanisms of the viruses.\n- RuV requires entry into the endosomal pathway and subsequent exposure to low $pH$ to trigger the fusogenic conformational change of its E1 glycoprotein, allowing its genome to enter the cytoplasm. The lysosomotropic agent raises endosomal pH, thereby blocking this critical step. This is reflected in the drastic reduction of $f_{\\mathrm{RuV}}$ from $0.80$ to $0.02$.\n- MeV and MuV, being paramyxoviruses, possess fusion proteins that are triggered by receptor binding at the cell surface at neutral $pH$. They fuse directly with the plasma membrane. Their entry pathway is independent of endosomal acidification. Consequently, the lysosomotropic weak base has no effect on their entry, which is reflected in the unchanged values of $f_{\\mathrm{MeV}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{MuV}}$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n- **A. RuV total PFU decreases by approximately $37$-fold, whereas MeV and MuV PFU are essentially unchanged (less than $1.1$-fold difference), because RuV requires low endosomal $pH$ to trigger E1-mediated fusion and endosomal escape, while MeV and MuV fuse at the plasma membrane at neutral $pH$ via a $pH$-independent fusion mechanism.**\n    - The quantitative part of this statement ($37$-fold decrease for RuV, essentially no change for MeV/MuV) is precisely what was calculated.\n    - The mechanistic explanation is scientifically correct and perfectly aligns with the provided base facts and the calculated results.\n    - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. All three viruses show a similar multi-log decrease in PFU because all enveloped viruses require endosomal acidification to fuse and uncoat; the lysosomotropic agent neutralizes endosomes for all three.**\n    - The quantitative assertion is false; our calculations show no decrease for MeV and MuV.\n    - The mechanistic premise that \"all enveloped viruses require endosomal acidification\" is a gross oversimplification and is factually incorrect. The problem itself provides MeV and MuV as counterexamples.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. MeV and MuV show a greater than $30$-fold decrease in PFU due to inhibition of their $pH$-dependent fusion, whereas RuV PFU is unchanged because it fuses at the plasma membrane.**\n    - The quantitative part is the inverse of the correct result.\n    - The mechanistic part swaps the established entry pathways of the viruses. RuV is the virus that uses the low-pH endosomal pathway, not MeV and MuV.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. RuV PFU decreases by approximately $5$-fold due to partial endosomal neutralization, and MeV PFU increases modestly due to enhanced receptor recycling at the plasma membrane; MuV is unchanged.**\n    - The quantitative part is incorrect. The calculated decrease for RuV is $\\approx 37$-fold, not $5$-fold. It also incorrectly claims an increase for MeV, whereas the provided data ($f$ is constant) dictates no change is possible.\n    - The mechanistic part introduces a hypothesis (\"enhanced receptor recycling\") that is not supported by the problem statement or the given data.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4662952"}, {"introduction": "The success of the MMR vaccine program relies on a two-dose schedule to achieve high rates of seroprotection in the population.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in probability theory applied to epidemiology. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to find the expected proportion of the cohort that is seroprotected to MMR after the $2$-dose campaign. By the law of large numbers in a well-mixed cohort, this proportion is equivalent to the probability that a single, randomly chosen individual from the cohort becomes seroprotected to MMR.\n\nLet $S_i$ be the event that an individual is seroprotected to antigen $i$ after the $2$-dose campaign. The problem defines \"seroprotected to MMR\" as being seroprotected to all three antigens. Let $P_{\\text{MMR}}$ be the probability of this outcome. This can be written as:\n$$P_{\\text{MMR}} = P(S_1 \\cap S_2 \\cap S_3)$$\n\nThe problem states that seroconversion events are independent across antigens. Therefore, the probability of being protected against all three is the product of the individual probabilities of being protected against each one:\n$$P_{\\text{MMR}} = P(S_1) P(S_2) P(S_3) = \\prod_{i=1}^{3} P(S_i)$$\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the probability, $P(S_i)$, that an individual seroconverts to a single antigen $i$ over the course of the two-dose schedule. It is most straightforward to first calculate the probability of the complementary event, $\\neg S_i$, which is the event that the individual *fails* to seroconvert to antigen $i$ after both doses.\n$$P(S_i) = 1 - P(\\neg S_i)$$\n\nAn individual fails to seroconvert to antigen $i$ if and only if they fail to seroconvert on dose $1$ AND they fail to seroconvert on dose $2$. Let $C_{i,j}$ be the event of seroconversion to antigen $i$ on dose $j$. Then $\\neg S_i$ is the event $\\neg C_{i,1} \\cap \\neg C_{i,2}$. The probability of this joint event is given by:\n$$P(\\neg S_i) = P(\\neg C_{i,1} \\cap \\neg C_{i,2}) = P(\\neg C_{i,1}) P(\\neg C_{i,2} | \\neg C_{i,1})$$\n\nThe cohort is initially seronegative. The probability of seroconverting on dose $1$ for antigen $i$ is $p_{i,1}$. Thus, the probability of *failing* to seroconvert on dose $1$ is:\n$$P(\\neg C_{i,1}) = 1 - p_{i,1}$$\n\nAn individual who failed to seroconvert on dose $1$ remains seronegative. According to the problem statement, the probability that such a seronegative individual seroconverts on dose $2$ is $p_{i,2}$. This is precisely the conditional probability $P(C_{i,2} | \\neg C_{i,1}) = p_{i,2}$. Consequently, the conditional probability of *failing* to seroconvert on dose $2$, given failure on dose $1$, is:\n$$P(\\neg C_{i,2} | \\neg C_{i,1}) = 1 - p_{i,2}$$\n\nThe \"independence of seroconversion events across doses\" assumption reinforces that the probability of success on the second dose for a seronegative person is simply $p_{i,2}$, irrespective of the history of a prior failure.\n\nNow we can calculate the probability of total failure, $P(\\neg S_i)$:\n$$P(\\neg S_i) = (1 - p_{i,1})(1 - p_{i,2})$$\n\nThe probability of success, $P(S_i)$, is therefore:\n$$P(S_i) = 1 - P(\\neg S_i) = 1 - (1 - p_{i,1})(1 - p_{i,2})$$\nThis can be expanded for verification: $P(S_i) = 1 - (1 - p_{i,1} - p_{i,2} + p_{i,1}p_{i,2}) = p_{i,1} + p_{i,2} - p_{i,1}p_{i,2}$. This corresponds to the probability of seroconverting on dose $1$ OR (failing on dose $1$ AND seroconverting on dose $2$).\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $P(S_i)$ back into the product formula for $P_{\\text{MMR}}$:\n$$P_{\\text{MMR}} = \\prod_{i=1}^{3} [1 - (1 - p_{i,1})(1 - p_{i,2})]$$\n\nThis closed-form expression represents the expected proportion of the cohort that is seroprotected to measles, mumps, and rubella after the $2$-dose campaign, based on the given parameters and assumptions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\prod_{i=1}^{3} \\left[1 - (1 - p_{i,1})(1 - p_{i,2})\\right]}$$", "id": "4662979"}, {"introduction": "The concept of herd immunity provides the mathematical foundation for population-level infectious disease control through vaccination.
