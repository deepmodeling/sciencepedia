It provides all necessary parameters ($L_{\\mathrm{finger}}$, $L_{\\mathrm{face}}$) and the complete probability distribution for the transport speed $V$. The task is to calculate expected values, which is a standard procedure in probability theory. A unique solution exists and can be determined from the given information.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and objective language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe time $T$ required for the virus to travel a distance $L$ at a constant speed $V$ is given by the fundamental kinematic relation:\n$$\nT = \\frac{L}{V}\n$$\nIn this model, the transport speed $V$ is not a constant but a random variable, described by a uniform probability distribution over the interval $[a, b]$, where $a=50$ $\\mathrm{mm/day}$ and $b=100$ $\\mathrm{mm/day}$. The probability density function (PDF) of $V$, denoted $f_V(v)$, is:\n$$\nf_V(v) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{b-a}  \\text{for } a \\le v \\le b \\\\ 0  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, we have:\n$$\nf_V(v) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{100-50} = \\frac{1}{50}  \\text{for } 50 \\le v \\le 100 \\\\ 0  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nSince $T$ is a function of the random variable $V$, $T$ itself is a random variable. The problem asks for the expected time to CNS involvement, $E[T]$. For a continuous random variable, the expected value of a function $g(V)$ is given by $E[g(V)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(v) f_V(v) \\, dv$. Here, our function is $g(V) = T = L/V$.\n\nThe expected time, $E[T]$, can be calculated as:\n$$\nE[T] = E\\left[\\frac{L}{V}\\right]\n$$\nSince $L$ is a constant for a given exposure site, we can write:\n$$\nE[T] = L \\cdot E\\left[\\frac{1}{V}\\right]\n$$\nWe must first compute $E[1/V]$:\n$$\nE\\left[\\frac{1}{V}\\right] = \\int_{50}^{100} \\frac{1}{v} f_V(v) \\, dv = \\int_{50}^{100} \\frac{1}{v} \\left(\\frac{1}{50}\\right) \\, dv = \\frac{1}{50} \\int_{50}^{100} \\frac{1}{v} \\, dv\n$$\nThe integral of $1/v$ is $\\ln|v|$.

For this uniform distribution, $E[V] = (a+b)/2 = (50+100)/2 = 75$, so $1/E[V] = 1/75$. However, $E[1/V] = \\ln(2)/50 \\approx 0.6931/50 \\approx 0.01386$, which is different from $1/75 \\approx 0.01333$. Using the incorrect assumption $E[1/V] = 1/E[V]$ would yield an erroneous result.\n\nNow, we can derive the expected time for each exposure.\nFor the finger exposure, $L_{\\mathrm{finger}} = 800$ $\\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$\nE[T_{\\mathrm{finger}}] = L_{\\mathrm{finger}} \\cdot E\\left[\\frac{1}{V}\\right] = 800 \\, \\mathrm{mm} \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(2)}{50 \\, \\mathrm{mm/day}} = 16 \\ln(2) \\, \\mathrm{days}\n$$\nFor the face exposure, $L_{\\mathrm{face}} = 120$ $\\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$\nE[T_{\\mathrm{face}}] = L_{\\mathrm{face}} \\cdot E\\left[\\frac{1}{V}\\right] = 120 \\, \\mathrm{mm} \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(2)}{50 \\, \\mathrm{mm/day}} = \\frac{12}{5} \\ln(2) \\, \\mathrm{days} = 2.4 \\ln(2) \\, \\mathrm{days}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the expected difference in time to CNS involvement, which we denote as $E[\\Delta T]$. Due to the linearity of the expectation operator, we have:\n$$\nE[\\Delta T] = E[T_{\\mathrm{finger}} - T_{\\mathrm{face}}] = E[T_{\\mathrm{finger}}] - E[T_{\\mathrm{face}}]\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$\nE[\\Delta T] = 16 \\ln(2) - 2.4 \\ln(2) = (16 - 2.4) \\ln(2) = 13.6 \\ln(2) \\, \\mathrm{days}\n$$\nAlternatively, we can first define the difference in time $\\Delta T$ as a function of $V$:\n$$\n\\Delta T = T_{\\mathrm{finger}} - T_{\\mathrm{face}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{finger}}}{V} - \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{face}}}{V} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{finger}} - L_{\\mathrm{face}}}{V}\n$$\nThen, we compute its expectation:\n$$\nE[\\Delta T] = E\\left[ \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{finger}} - L_{\\mathrm{face}}}{V} \\right] = (L_{\\mathrm{finger}} - L_{\\mathrm{face}}) E\\left[\\frac{1}{V}\\right]\n$$\nWith $L_{\\mathrm{finger}} - L_{\\mathrm{face}} = 800 \\, \\mathrm{mm} - 120 \\, \\mathrm{mm} = 680 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$\nE[\\Delta T] = 680 \\, \\mathrm{mm} \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(2)}{50 \\, \\mathrm{mm/day}} = \\frac{68}{5} \\ln(2) \\, \\mathrm{days} = 13.6 \\ln(2) \\, \\mathrm{days}\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same analytical result. Now, we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures.\n$$\nE[\\Delta T] = 13.6 \\times \\ln(2) \\approx 13.6 \\times 0.69314718 \\approx 9.42679965...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $9.427$.

Do not exceed the total of $1240$ $\\mathrm{IU}$.**\n-   The calculations for total dose, undiluted volume, and required infiltration volume are all correct.\n-   The calculation of the $\\approx 1.33$-fold minimal dilution is correct.\n-   The plan to infiltrate the specific volumes into the corresponding wounds is correct.\n-   The principle of injecting any residual amount into a distant IM site (anterolateral thigh) and avoiding the vaccine limb is correct.\n-   The adherence to the maximum total dose of $1240$ $\\mathrm{IU}$ is correct.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Divide the calculated HRIG dose equally by the $9$ wounds to assign an immunoglobulin amount per wound, and if the per-wound volume is insufficient, add more undiluted HRIG until each wound receives at least $0.50$ $\\mathrm{mL}$, even if this exceeds the total IU calculated, because local neutralization is paramount in small wounds.**\n-   Dividing the dose equally per wound is clinically incorrect.

Dilute the HRIG $1:3$ (threefold) in normal saline regardless of need, infiltrate generously into all wounds, and inject any remaining dose subcutaneously into the same deltoid receiving the vaccine to maximize local immune synergy.**\n-   A fixed dilution \"regardless of need\" is not the correct principle. Dilution should be calculated based on the required volume. A $1:3$ dilution (one part HRIG to two parts saline) would create a total volume of $4.133 \\, \\mathrm{mL} \\times 3 = 12.4 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$, which is excessive, not minimal.\n-   Injecting RIG into the same site as the vaccine is a major contraindication. The passive antibodies will neutralize the vaccine antigens, potentially leading to PEP failure. The concept of \"local immune synergy\" is non-existent and scientifically false in this context.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Avoid dilution and limit infiltration into digits to less than $0.10$ $\\mathrm{mL}$ per puncture to prevent pressure complications, inject the majority of HRIG intramuscularly, and accept that systemic neutralization will suffice given concurrent vaccine.**\n-   Avoiding dilution is incorrect, as the undiluted volume is insufficient to cover all wounds.\n-   Arbitrarily limiting infiltration to $0.10$ $\\mathrm{mL}$ contradicts the problem's stated minimum requirement of $0.20$ $\\mathrm{mL}$ and violates the principle of infiltrating as much as is anatomically feasible.\n-   Prioritizing IM injection over local infiltration is a direct violation of the primary goal of RIG administration. The dogma is \"the most important drops of RIG are the first ones into the wound.\"\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Calculate the dose volume using $150$ $\\mathrm{IU/mL}$ as the product concentration and use Equine Rabies Immunoglobulin (ERIG) dosing at $40$ $\\mathrm{IU/kg}$ to ensure adequate coverage for numerous wounds, infiltrating the calculated larger volume locally and injecting any remainder intramuscularly.**\n-   Using a concentration of $150$ $\\mathrm{IU/mL}$ contradicts the given information that the available product is $300$ $\\mathrm{IU/mL}$.\n-   Substituting ERIG and its dosing schedule ($40$ $\\mathrm{IU/kg}$) is incorrect. The problem specifies HRIG, and different immunoglobulin products are not interchangeable without clinical justification (e.g., availability), and their dosing is distinct.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4686340"}]}
