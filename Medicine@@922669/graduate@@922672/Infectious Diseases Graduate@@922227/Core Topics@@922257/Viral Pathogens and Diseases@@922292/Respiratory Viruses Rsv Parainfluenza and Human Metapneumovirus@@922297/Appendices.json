The RdRP initiates at the $3'$ leader and transcribes the genome as a series of monocistronic messenger RNAs (mRNAs), encountering a boundary between each successive gene where it may terminate and disengage. Assume the following scientifically grounded features, consistent with these viruses:\n- At each gene boundary, the RdRP independently terminates with probability $p$ and continues with probability $\\left(1-p\\right)$.\n- On each successful pass through a gene, the RdRP produces exactly $1$ mRNA for that gene before encountering the next boundary.\n- Polymerase initiation events at the $3'$ leader occur at a constant rate $J$ per genome per unit time.\n- All viral mRNAs share the same first-order degradation rate constant $k_{d}$, and the system is at steady state.\n- Gene positions are indexed by $i \\in \\{1,2,\\dots\\}$ in the order encountered by the RdRP from the $3'$ end, so gene $1$ is most proximal to $3'$.\n\nUsing only fundamental probabilistic reasoning and the steady-state balance from first-order birth–death processes for mRNA, derive a closed-form expression for the steady-state ratio of expected mRNA abundance of gene $i$ relative to gene $1$, namely $M_{i}/M_{1}$, as a function of $p$ and $i$. Your final expression must not contain $J$ or $k_{d}$.\n\nIn addition, briefly explain, in words, how this transcription mechanism shapes the gradient of protein expression across the gene order, assuming gene-specific translation rates and protein degradation rates are approximately similar.\n\nProvide your final result for $M_{i}/M_{1}$ as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $p$ and $i$ only. No numerical evaluation is required, and no units are to be reported in the final answer.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. It describes a standard model of transcriptional polarity in non-segmented negative-sense RNA viruses, which is a known biological phenomenon. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided to derive a unique solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the ratio of steady-state mRNA abundance of gene $i$ to gene $1$, denoted $M_{i}/M_{1}$. We will model this using probabilistic reasoning for transcription and a first-order birth-death process for mRNA kinetics.\n\nLet us first determine the probability that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) successfully transcribes gene $i$. The genes are ordered $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$ from the $3'$ end.\nFor the RdRP to transcribe gene $1$, it only needs to initiate at the $3'$ leader. This occurs for every initiation event.\nFor the RdRP to transcribe gene $2$, it must first transcribe gene $1$ and then successfully pass the intergenic boundary between gene $1$ and gene $2$. The probability of continuing (i.e., not terminating) at a boundary is given as $(1-p)$. Thus, the probability of reaching and transcribing gene $2$, given an initiation event, is $(1-p)$.\nFor the RdRP to transcribe gene $3$, it must pass the boundary after gene $1$ and then also pass the boundary after gene $2$. As the termination events at each boundary are independent, the probability of successfully passing two consecutive boundaries is $(1-p) \\times (1-p) = (1-p)^{2}$.\nGeneralizing this pattern, for the RdRP to reach and transcribe gene $i$, it must successfully pass the $i-1$ intergenic boundaries that precede it. The probability of this cascade of successful events, $P_{i}$, is:\n$$ P_{i} = (1-p)^{i-1} $$\nThis expression gives the probability that any given polymerase that initiates transcription will proceed to synthesize an mRNA for gene $i$.\n\nNext, let us establish the kinetic model for the abundance of mRNA molecules for gene $i$, which we denote as $M_{i}$. The problem describes a birth-death process where the change in $M_{i}$ over time can be written as:\n$$ \\frac{dM_{i}}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Synthesis}) - (\\text{Rate of Degradation}) $$\nThe rate of synthesis of mRNA for gene $i$ is the rate of polymerase initiation, $J$, multiplied by the probability, $P_{i}$, that an initiated polymerase successfully transcribes gene $i$. The problem states that exactly $1$ mRNA is produced on a successful pass. Thus, the synthesis rate is:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Synthesis} = J \\cdot P_{i} = J(1-p)^{i-1} $$\nThe degradation of mRNA is a first-order process with rate constant $k_{d}$. The rate of degradation is therefore proportional to the current abundance $M_{i}$:\n$$ \\text{Rate of Degradation} = k_{d} M_{i} $$\nCombining these terms, the differential equation governing the abundance of mRNA for gene $i$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dM_{i}}{dt} = J(1-p)^{i-1} - k_{d}M_{i} $$\nThe problem specifies that the system is at steady state. At steady state, the net rate of change of abundance is zero, i.e., $\\frac{dM_{i}}{dt} = 0$. We can therefore solve for the steady-state abundance $M_{i}$:\n$$ 0 = J(1-p)^{i-1} - k_{d}M_{i} $$\n$$ k_{d}M_{i} = J(1-p)^{i-1} $$\n$$ M_{i} = \\frac{J}{k_{d}}(1-p)^{i-1} $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the steady-state abundance of mRNA for gene $i$.\n\nOur final goal is to find the ratio of the abundance of mRNA for gene $i$ relative to gene $1$, which is $M_{i}/M_{1}$. We first find the expression for $M_{1}$ by setting $i=1$ in the general formula:\n$$ M_{1} = \\frac{J}{k_{d}}(1-p)^{1-1} = \\frac{J}{k_{d}}(1-p)^{0} = \\frac{J}{k_{d}} $$\nNow, we can compute the ratio $M_{i}/M_{1}$:\n$$ \\frac{M_{i}}{M_{1}} = \\frac{\\frac{J}{k_{d}}(1-p)^{i-1}}{\\frac{J}{k_{d}}} $$\nThe terms $J$ and $k_{d}$ cancel out, yielding the final expression which depends only on the termination probability $p$ and the gene index $i$:\n$$ \\frac{M_{i}}{M_{1}} = (1-p)^{i-1} $$\nThis result demonstrates that the relative abundance of mRNA transcripts decreases exponentially as a function of the gene's distance from the $3'$ promoter.\n\nRegarding the second part of the question, this transcriptional mechanism directly shapes the gradient of protein expression. The quantity of a specific protein synthesized is, to a first approximation, proportional to the abundance of its corresponding mRNA, assuming similar translation rates and protein stabilities across the different genes. Since the mRNA abundance follows the relationship $M_1 > M_2 > M_3 > \\dots$, the protein abundance will exhibit the same gradient. Proteins encoded by genes near the $3'$ end of the genome will be produced in large quantities, while proteins encoded by genes progressively further towards the $5'$ end will be produced in smaller and smaller quantities. This allows the virus to economically regulate the stoichiometry of its proteins. For instance, structural proteins like the nucleocapsid protein (N), which are needed in large numbers to encapsidate the viral genome, are typically encoded by the first gene. Conversely, the enzymatic protein, RdRP (or L protein), which is only needed in catalytic amounts, is typically encoded by the last or one of the last genes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(1-p)^{i-1}}$$", "id": "4687222"}, {"introduction": "A key question in pediatric infectious disease is why viruses like RSV cause severe bronchiolitis in infants but often only a mild cold in adults.
