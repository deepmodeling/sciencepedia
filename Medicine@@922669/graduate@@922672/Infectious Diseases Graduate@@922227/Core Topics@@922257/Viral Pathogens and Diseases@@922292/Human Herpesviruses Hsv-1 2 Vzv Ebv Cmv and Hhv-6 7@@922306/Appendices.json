This exercise delves into the mechanism of acyclovir, a cornerstone drug against Herpes Simplex Virus, by modeling its competition with the natural substrate dGTP for the viral DNA polymerase. By applying the principles of Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics, you will quantitatively assess the degree of inhibition at clinically relevant drug concentrations and determine how much of the enzyme is bound by the drug, providing a tangible link between biochemical parameters and therapeutic effect [@problem_id:4651550].", "problem": "Acyclovir requires activation to acyclovir triphosphate to inhibit Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1) DNA polymerase. Consider HSV-1 DNA polymerase that binds either the natural substrate deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) or the competitive analog acyclovir triphosphate at the same active site. Assume the standard quasi-steady-state Michaelis–Menten framework for a single binding site with mutually exclusive ligands and that the rapid-equilibrium approximation holds such that the Michaelis constant approximates the dissociation constant for active-site binding. The following kinetic parameters have been measured under identical conditions for the HSV-1 polymerase: for dGTP, $K_{m,\\mathrm{dGTP}} = 6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{dGTP}} = 120\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$; for acyclovir triphosphate, $K_{m,\\mathrm{ACV\\text{-}TP}} = 0.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. In an HSV-1 infected cell on acyclovir therapy, intracellular concentrations are $[\\mathrm{dGTP}] = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $[\\mathrm{ACV\\text{-}TP}] = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of enzyme–substrate binding and the Michaelis–Menten description of competitive inhibition for a single active site, first compute the fold change in the dGTP incorporation rate due to competitive inhibition by acyclovir triphosphate at the stated intracellular concentrations, expressed as the ratio $v_{\\mathrm{inh}}/v_{0}$ where $v_{0}$ is the rate in the absence of acyclovir triphosphate and $v_{\\mathrm{inh}}$ is the rate in its presence. Then, estimate the fractional occupancy of the polymerase active site by acyclovir triphosphate under the same conditions.\n\nRound both quantities to four significant figures. Express the fold change and the fractional occupancy as decimal fractions without percent signs. No units are required in the final numerical values; however, use and show units in intermediate steps as appropriate.", "solution": "The goal is to determine two quantities grounded in enzyme kinetics for a single-site system with competing ligands: the fold change in the incorporation rate for deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) in the presence of acyclovir triphosphate, and the fractional occupancy of the polymerase active site by acyclovir triphosphate (ACV-TP).\n\nWe begin from the core definitions of enzyme kinetics. For a single-substrate reaction under the Michaelis–Menten framework, the velocity as a function of substrate concentration $[\\mathrm{S}]$ is\n$$\nv = \\frac{V_{\\max}[\\mathrm{S}]}{K_{m} + [\\mathrm{S}]},\n$$\nwhere $K_{m}$ is the Michaelis constant and $V_{\\max}$ is the maximal velocity. In the presence of a competitive inhibitor that binds to the same active site, the effect is to increase the apparent $K_{m}$ for the substrate by a factor $\\alpha$ without changing $V_{\\max}$. Specifically, for a competitive inhibitor concentration $[\\mathrm{I}]$ and inhibition constant $K_{i}$,\n$$\n\\alpha = 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{I}]}{K_{i}}, \\quad K_{m,\\mathrm{app}} = \\alpha K_{m}.\n$$\nIn our case, acyclovir triphosphate competes at the same active site where dGTP binds. Under the rapid-equilibrium approximation and identical binding site for both ligands, the inhibition constant $K_{i}$ for competitive binding by acyclovir triphosphate is well-approximated by its Michaelis constant $K_{m,\\mathrm{ACV\\text{-}TP}}$, because $K_{m}$ approximates the dissociation constant when $k_{\\mathrm{cat}} \\ll k_{-1}$ and we consider binding competition at the active site.\n\nTherefore, for dGTP incorporation we have the uninhibited velocity\n$$\nv_{0} = \\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{dGTP}}[\\mathrm{dGTP}]}{K_{m,\\mathrm{dGTP}} + [\\mathrm{dGTP}]},\n$$\nand the inhibited velocity in the presence of acyclovir triphosphate\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{inh}} = \\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{dGTP}}[\\mathrm{dGTP}]}{\\alpha K_{m,\\mathrm{dGTP}} + [\\mathrm{dGTP}]}, \\quad \\alpha = 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{ACV\\text{-}TP}]}{K_{i}}, \\quad K_{i} \\approx K_{m,\\mathrm{ACV\\text{-}TP}}.\n$$\nThe fold change is then\n$$\n\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{inh}}}{v_{0}} = \\frac{K_{m,\\mathrm{dGTP}} + [\\mathrm{dGTP}]}{\\alpha K_{m,\\mathrm{dGTP}} + [\\mathrm{dGTP}]}.\n$$\n\nNext, we estimate the fractional occupancy of the enzyme active site by acyclovir triphosphate. For a single binding site with mutually exclusive ligands under rapid equilibrium, the probability that the site is occupied by ligand $i$ is proportional to $[\\mathrm{L}_{i}]/K_{d,i}$, where $K_{d,i}$ is the dissociation constant of ligand $i$. Normalizing over the possibilities of being unbound or bound by any of the ligands, the fractional occupancy by ligand $i$ is\n$$\nf_{i} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{L}_{i}]/K_{d,i}}{1 + \\sum_{j} [\\mathrm{L}_{j}]/K_{d,j}}.\n$$\nUnder the same rapid-equilibrium assumption and for polymerase substrates at the active site, we use $K_{m}$ as a proxy for $K_{d}$ for both dGTP and acyclovir triphosphate.
