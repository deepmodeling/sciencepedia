{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The molecular signature of antigenic drift is imprinted in the genome of the influenza virus. By comparing the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions ($dN$), which alter the resulting protein, to the rate of synonymous substitutions ($dS$), which are silent, we can infer the selective pressures acting on a gene. This practice ([@problem_id:4657325]) guides you through implementing a codon-based substitution model to calculate the $dN/dS$ ratio ($\\omega$), allowing you to identify the hallmark of positive selection ($\\omega \\gt 1$) in the hemagglutinin gene and test for its enrichment in antigenic regions.", "problem": "You are tasked with implementing a site-wise inference of the nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratio, denoted by $dN/dS$ (conventionally called $\\omega$), for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein-coding sequence using a continuous-time Markov chain on codons and interpreting elevated values at antigenic sites as evidence of positive selection, consistent with antigenic drift. Your program must build a codon substitution model, compute site-specific maximum likelihood estimates of $\\omega$ on a small fixed star phylogeny, and then summarize whether antigenic sites show elevated $\\omega$ relative to non-antigenic sites.\n\nFundamental base:\n- The genetic code maps each sense codon to one amino acid, with three stop codons that do not code for amino acids.\n- A continuous-time Markov chain on codons with state space restricted to sense codons can model codon substitutions, where instantaneous rates reflect single-nucleotide changes, transition versus transversion mutation bias, and a scaling factor on nonsynonymous changes.\n- For a rate matrix $Q$, the time-$t$ transition probability matrix is $P(t) = \\exp(Qt)$, and the likelihood of observed tip states on a star phylogeny marginalizes over the unobserved ancestral state with stationary distribution $\\pi$.\n- The nonsynonymous to synonymous rate ratio $\\omega = dN/dS$ captures the relative fixation rates of nonsynonymous to synonymous changes under selection; $\\omega > 1$ indicates positive selection, $\\omega \\approx 1$ neutrality, and $\\omega < 1$ purifying selection.\n\nModel assumptions to implement:\n- State space consists of all sense codons under the standard genetic code (exclude stop codons).\n- Instantaneous rate $q_{ij}$ is nonzero only if codons $i$ and $j$ differ by a single nucleotide. Let the nucleotide mutation bias be controlled by a transition-versus-transversion ratio parameter $\\kappa$. For a single-nucleotide change, use a base mutation rate that is proportional to $\\kappa$ if the change is a transition and proportional to $1$ if it is a transversion. Multiply this base rate by $\\omega$ if the change is nonsynonymous, and by $1$ if it is synonymous. Set $q_{ii}$ so that each row sums to zero.\n- Use uniform stationary codon frequencies over sense codons, $\\pi_i = 1/N$ where $N$ is the number of sense codons.\n- Scale $Q$ so that the mean substitution rate is $1$ per unit time under $\\pi$, i.e., $-\\sum_i \\pi_i q_{ii} = 1$. With this scaling, branch length $t$ is measured in expected substitutions per codon.\n\nPhylogeny and likelihood:\n- Use a star phylogeny with three leaves with equal branch lengths. For each site, the observed codons at the three leaves are denoted $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$. For a given $\\omega$, the site likelihood under branch length $t$ is\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\omega) \\;=\\; \\sum_{a} \\pi_a \\prod_{\\ell=1}^{3} P_{a,x_\\ell}(t),\n$$\nwhere $P(t) = \\exp(Qt)$ is the transition probability matrix. The site-specific maximum likelihood estimate $\\widehat{\\omega}$ is the value of $\\omega$ on a specified grid that maximizes $\\mathcal{L}(\\omega)$.\n- Use a fixed transition/transversion bias $\\kappa = 3.0$ (dimensionless) and branch length $t = 0.5$ (in expected substitutions per codon).\n\nAntigenic drift and interpretation:\n- Antigenic regions of HA are subject to immune pressure and are expected to exhibit elevated $\\omega$ under positive selection. You will compute the mean of $\\widehat{\\omega}$ over a set of antigenic sites and over a set of non-antigenic sites, then report the difference.\n\nComputational task:\n1. Construct the codon alphabet of size $N$ by excluding stop codons under the standard genetic code.\n2. For a grid of $\\omega$ values $\\Omega = \\{0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0\\}$, build $Q(\\omega)$ as above, scale it to unit mean rate, and compute $P_\\omega(t) = \\exp(Q(\\omega) t)$ for the given $t$.\n3. For each site and each dataset, compute the site likelihood $\\mathcal{L}(\\omega)$ by summing over all ancestral codon states and taking the product across the three leaves. Select $\\widehat{\\omega}$ as the grid value maximizing $\\mathcal{L}(\\omega)$ for that site.\n4. For each dataset, compute the mean of $\\widehat{\\omega}$ across antigenic sites and the mean across non-antigenic sites, then compute the difference $\\Delta = \\overline{\\omega}_{\\text{antigenic}} - \\overline{\\omega}_{\\text{non-antigenic}}$.\n\nInput data are fixed within the program; no user input is required.\n\nUse the following three datasets (each with three sequences labeled $A$, $B$, $C$ and six codon positions). Codons are written with nucleotides from the set $\\{A,C,G,T\\}$:\n\n- Dataset 1 (antigenic sites predominantly synonymous or conserved):\n  - Antigenic site indices: $\\{2,5\\}$ (one-based indexing).\n  - $A$: [GCT, GAA, TTT, ATG, CTA, CGT]\n  - $B$: [GCT, GAG, TTC, ATG, TTA, CGC]\n  - $C$: [GCT, GAA, TTT, ATA, CTA, AGT]\n\n- Dataset 2 (antigenic sites with multiple nonsynonymous differences):\n  - Antigenic site indices: $\\{2,5\\}$.\n  - $A$: [GCT, GAA, TTT, ATG, CTA, CGT]\n  - $B$: [GCT, AAA, TTC, ATG, GTA, CGC]\n  - $C$: [GCT, GCA, TTT, ATG, TCA, CGT]\n\n- Dataset 3 (ambiguous signal with mixed synonymous and nonsynonymous changes):\n  - Antigenic site indices: $\\{2,5\\}$.\n  - $A$: [GCT, GAA, TTT, ATG, CTA, CGT]\n  - $B$: [GCT, GAG, TTC, ATA, CTT, CGT]\n  - $C$: [GCT, AAA, TTT, ATG, CTA, CGC]\n\nAngle units are not applicable. No physical units are involved. All results are dimensionless.\n\nTest suite and required output:\n- Implement the above for the three datasets with $\\kappa = 3.0$, $t = 0.5$, and the specified $\\Omega$.\n- For each dataset, compute $\\Delta$ as defined. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results for the three datasets as a comma-separated list of three floats rounded to three decimals, enclosed in square brackets, in the order of Dataset 1, Dataset 2, Dataset 3 (e.g., \"[0.123,0.456,-0.789]\").", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular evolution, well-posed with a clear and complete set of instructions, and objective in its formulation. The task is to implement a site-specific codon substitution model to infer the nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution rate ratio, $\\omega$, and to ascertain if antigenic sites in the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein show evidence of positive selection.\n\nThe solution proceeds in four main stages:\n1.  Definition of the codon model and state space.\n2.  Construction of the instantaneous rate matrix, $Q$.\n3.  Calculation of site likelihoods on a star phylogeny.\n4.  Maximum likelihood estimation of $\\omega$ for each site and analysis of the results.\n\n**1. Codon Model State Space**\n\nThe model operates on codons, which are triplets of nucleotides. The standard genetic code maps $64$ possible codons to $20$ amino acids and $3$ stop signals. The state space of our continuous-time Markov chain is restricted to the $N=61$ sense codons, excluding the three stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`). A definitive list of these $61$ codons is established, and a mapping is created from each codon string to a unique integer index from $0$ to $60$ for matrix operations. The stationary distribution, $\\pi$, is assumed to be uniform over this state space, such that the frequency of any sense codon $i$ is $\\pi_i = 1/N = 1/61$.\n\n**2. Instantaneous Rate Matrix, $Q(\\omega, \\kappa)$**\n\nThe instantaneous rate of substitution from codon $i$ to codon $j$, denoted by $q_{ij}$ for $i \\neq j$, is defined based on a mechanistic model of nucleotide mutation and selection. The matrix $Q$ is of size $N \\times N$, i.e., $61 \\times 61$.\n\nThe rate $q_{ij}$ is non-zero only if codons $i$ and $j$ differ by a single nucleotide. For such pairs, the rate is given by:\n$$\nq_{ij} =\n\\begin{cases}\n    \\kappa             & \\text{if synonymous transition} \\\\\n    1                  & \\text{if synonymous transversion} \\\\\n    \\omega \\cdot \\kappa  & \\text{if nonsynonymous transition} \\\\\n    \\omega \\cdot 1       & \\text{if nonsynonymous transversion}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n- A **transition** is a substitution between purines (A $\\leftrightarrow$ G) or between pyrimidines (C $\\leftrightarrow$ T). A **transversion** is any other substitution (purine $\\leftrightarrow$ pyrimidine). The transition/transversion rate ratio is fixed at $\\kappa = 3.0$.\n- A substitution is **synonymous** if it does not change the amino acid encoded by the codon. The rate of such changes is scaled by a factor of $1$.\n- A substitution is **nonsynonymous** if it results in a different amino acid. The rate of such changes is scaled by the parameter $\\omega = dN/dS$, which represents the selective pressure.\n\nThe diagonal elements of the rate matrix are defined to ensure that the rows sum to zero:\n$$\nq_{ii} = - \\sum_{j \\neq i} q_{ij}\n$$\nFinally, the entire matrix $Q$ is scaled to ensure the average substitution rate is $1$ per unit time. With a uniform stationary distribution $\\pi_i = 1/N$, this condition is $-\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\pi_i q_{ii} = 1$, which simplifies to:\n$$\nS = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} q_{ii} = 1\n$$\nThus, an initial unscaled matrix is constructed, and then every element is divided by the scaling factor $S = -\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i q_{ii}^{\\text{unscaled}}$. A separate rate matrix is constructed for each value of $\\omega$ in the specified grid $\\Omega = \\{0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0\\}$.\n\n**3. Phylogenetic Likelihood Calculation**\n\nThe problem specifies a star phylogeny with three tips (sequences $A, B, C$) and a common ancestor. All three branches leading from the ancestor to the tips have an equal length of $t = 0.5$, measured in expected substitutions per codon.\n\nThe probability of codon $i$ changing to codon $j$ over a branch of length $t$ is given by the matrix of transition probabilities, $P(t) = \\exp(Q t)$, where $Q$ is the scaled rate matrix. This matrix exponential is computed for each $Q(\\omega)$ matrix.\n\nFor a single site in the alignment, let the observed codons at the three tips be $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$. The likelihood of observing this data given a value of $\\omega$ is calculated by marginalizing over all possible ancestral codons, $a$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\omega) = \\sum_{a=0}^{N-1} \\pi_a \\prod_{\\ell=1}^{3} P_{a,x_\\ell}(t)\n$$\nGiven our assumption of uniform stationary frequencies, $\\pi_a = 1/N$, the formula becomes:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{a=0}^{N-1} P_{a,x_1}(t) \\cdot P_{a,x_2}(t) \\cdot P_{a,x_3}(t)\n$$\nThis likelihood is computed for each site and for every $\\omega$ in the grid $\\Omega$.\n\n**4. Estimation and Analysis**\n\nFor each site, the maximum likelihood estimate of omega, $\\widehat{\\omega}$, is determined by finding the value in the grid $\\Omega$ that maximizes the site likelihood $\\mathcal{L}(\\omega)$.\n\nAfter computing $\\widehat{\\omega}$ for all six sites in a dataset, the sites are partitioned into two groups: antigenic and non-antigenic, based on the provided indices (sites $2$ and $5$ are antigenic). The mean $\\widehat{\\omega}$ is calculated for each group:\n$$\n\\overline{\\omega}_{\\text{antigenic}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i \\in \\{2,5\\}} \\widehat{\\omega}_i \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\overline{\\omega}_{\\text{non-antigenic}} = \\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{i \\in \\{1,3,4,6\\}} \\widehat{\\omega}_i\n$$\nThe final result for each dataset is the difference between these means, $\\Delta = \\overline{\\omega}_{\\text{antigenic}} - \\overline{\\omega}_{\\text{non-antigenic}}$. A positive $\\Delta$ indicates that, on average, antigenic sites are under stronger positive selection than non-antigenic sites, consistent with the theory of antigenic drift.

The use of a logarithmic scale (specifically base-$2$) to quantify antigenic distance from titer data is a well-established convention, notably used in antigenic cartography.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear set of definitions and relationships that uniquely determine the quantity to be derived. The information is sufficient and self-contained.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal and quantitative, free from subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Complete and Consistent:** The provided definitions and conditions are not contradictory and are sufficient for deriving the required expression.\n- **Realistic:** While the assumption of a unity proportionality constant is a simplification, it is a standard approach for constructing a basic theoretical model to establish a fundamental relationship between variables.\n- **Verdict:** The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous derivation.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Expression\nThe solution proceeds by translating the given definitions into mathematical equations and combining them to find the desired relationship between the selection coefficient $s$ and the titer reduction factor $k$.\n\nFirst, we formalize the relationship between the antigenic distance, $d$, and the fold-change in neutralization titer, $k$. The problem explicitly states that \"antigenic distance $d$ is given by the base-$2$ logarithm of the fold-change in neutralization titer.\" The fold-change is given as $k$. Therefore, we can write the equation for antigenic distance as:\n$$\nd = \\log_{2}(k)\n$$\nThis definition is consistent with the provided information that a $2$-fold change ($k=2$) corresponds to one antigenic unit ($d=\\log_{2}(2)=1$).\n\nNext, we formalize the relationship between the selection coefficient, $s$, and the antigenic distance, $d$. The problem states that \"the selective advantage of an antigenic escape mutation is proportional to the antigenic distance implied by the titer fold-change.\" The selection coefficient, $s$, quantifies this selective advantage. The proportionality can be expressed as:\n$$\ns \\propto d\n$$\nIntroducing a proportionality constant, let's call it $C$, we can write this as an equation:\n$$\ns = C \\cdot d\n$$\nThe problem further specifies that \"the mapping is calibrated so that the proportionality constant is unity.\" This means that the value of the constant $C$ is $1$.\n$$\nC = 1\n$$\nSubstituting this value into the equation for $s$ gives a direct equality between the selection coefficient and the antigenic distance:\n$$\ns = d\n$$\nFinally, to express $s$ as a function of $k$, we substitute the expression for $d$ from the first step into this final equation.\nWe have $s=d$ and $d=\\log_{2}(k)$. Therefore, by substitution, we obtain the expression for the selection coefficient $s$ in terms of the titer reduction factor $k$:\n$$\ns(k) = \\log_{2}(k)\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the selection coefficient as a function of $k$ under the simple mapping described in the problem. The expression is dimensionless, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\log_{2}(k)}\n$$", "id": "4657332"}, {"introduction": "The continuous accumulation of antigenic mutations at the molecular level has profound consequences for disease dynamics at the population level. By allowing the virus to evade pre-existing immunity, antigenic drift creates a perennial supply of susceptible hosts, driving recurrent epidemics. This practice ([@problem_id:4657414]) delves into this connection by analyzing a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model modified to include an immune escape pathway, allowing you to mathematically explore how the rate of antigenic change can induce sustained oscillations in disease incidence.", "problem": "You are given a compartmental model for influenza transmission with antigenic drift, formulated as a Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered (SIR) model with demographic turnover and immune escape. Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered (SIR) denotes the standard epidemiological compartments: susceptible individuals $S$, infectious individuals $I$, and recovered (immune) individuals $R$. Demographic turnover is represented by a per capita birth and death rate $\\nu$, and antigenic drift-driven immune escape is represented by a rate $\\mu_a$ moving individuals from $R$ back to $S$. Transmission follows mass-action incidence with rate $\\beta$, and recovery occurs at rate $\\gamma$. The total population size $N$ is constant because births and deaths balance. The model is\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\nu N - \\frac{\\beta S I}{N} + \\mu_a R - \\nu S,\\quad\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\frac{\\beta S I}{N} - \\gamma I - \\nu I,\\quad\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\gamma I - \\mu_a R - \\nu R,\n$$\nwith $N = S + I + R$ constant.\n\nStarting only from these definitions and the model structure, determine whether small perturbations around the endemic equilibrium produce damped oscillations in incidence (that is, in $I$). When oscillations exist, compute the oscillation period in years implied by the local linear dynamics; when oscillations do not exist, define the period to be $0.0$ years. Your approach must be principled: derive the endemic equilibrium for $I>0$ under the condition $\\mathcal{R}_0 > 1$, where the basic reproduction number $\\mathcal{R}_0$ satisfies $\\mathcal{R}_0 = \\beta / (\\gamma + \\nu)$, then construct the Jacobian of the reduced system in $(S,I)$, analyze its eigenvalues, and extract the period from the imaginary part when the eigenvalues are complex. Express the final period in years as a real number rounded to $3$ decimal places.\n\nPhysical units: all rates $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $\\nu$, and $\\mu_a$ are per year, and the output period must be expressed in years.

The task is to determine the period of damped oscillations around the endemic equilibrium of a specified Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered (SIR) model. The solution requires a principled derivation based on linear stability analysis.\n\nThe model is described by the following system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\nu N - \\frac{\\beta S I}{N} + \\mu_a R - \\nu S\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\frac{\\beta S I}{N} - (\\gamma + \\nu) I\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\gamma I - \\mu_a R - \\nu R\n$$\nThe total population $N = S + I + R$ is constant, as the sum of the derivatives is zero: $\\frac{d(S+I+R)}{dt} = \\nu N - \\nu(S+I+R) = \\nu N - \\nu N = 0$. This allows us to reduce the system's dimensionality by substituting $R = N - S - I$.

From $\\frac{dI}{dt} = 0$, we have:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\beta S^*}{N} - (\\gamma + \\nu) \\right) I^* = 0\n$$\nSince $I^* > 0$, we must have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\beta S^*}{N} - (\\gamma + \\nu) = 0 \\implies S^* = \\frac{N(\\gamma + \\nu)}{\\beta}\n$$\nFor an endemic state to be meaningful ($S^* < N$), we must have $\\beta > \\gamma+\\nu$, which is equivalent to the basic reproduction number $\\mathcal{R}_0 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma+\\nu} > 1$.

This ensures that the real parts of the eigenvalues are negative, meaning the equilibrium is locally stable (perturbations are damped).\n\nOscillations occur if the eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair. This happens when the discriminant of the characteristic equation, $\\Delta = \\text{Tr}(J)^2 - 4\\det(J)$, is negative.\n$$\n\\Delta = \\left(-(\\nu+\\mu_a) - \\frac{\\beta I^*}{N}\\right)^2 - 4\\left(\\frac{\\beta I^*}{N}\\right)(\\gamma+\\nu+\\mu_a) < 0\n$$\nIf $\\Delta \\ge 0$, the eigenvalues are real, there are no oscillations, and the period $T$ is $0.0$.\nIf $\\Delta < 0$, the eigenvalues are $\\lambda = \\frac{\\text{Tr}(J)}{2} \\pm i\\omega$, where the angular frequency of oscillation $\\omega$ is:\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{\\sqrt{-\\Delta}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{4\\det(J) - \\text{Tr}(J)^2}}{2}\n$$\nThe period of oscillation $T$ is given by $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$.\n\nThe computational algorithm is as follows:\n1. For each parameter set $(N, \\beta, \\gamma, \\nu, \\mu_a)$, calculate $\\mathcal{R}_0 = \\beta / (\\gamma+\\nu)$.\n2. If $\\mathcal{R}_0 \\le 1$, the period $T = 0.0$.\n3. If $\\mathcal{R}_0 > 1$, proceed to calculate the equilibrium and stability properties.\n4. Calculate $I^* = \\frac{(\\nu + \\mu_a) N (1 - 1/\\mathcal{R}_0)}{\\gamma + \\nu + \\mu_a}$.\n5. Define a helper variable $X = \\frac{\\beta I^*}{N}$.\n6. Calculate the trace $\\text{Tr}(J) = -(\\nu+\\mu_a) - X$ and determinant $\\det(J) = X(\\gamma+\\nu+\\mu_a)$.\n7. Calculate the discriminant $\\Delta = \\text{Tr}(J)^2 - 4\\det(J)$.\n8. If $\\Delta \\ge 0$, the period $T=0.0$.\n9. If $\\Delta < 0$, calculate the angular frequency $\\omega = \\frac{\\sqrt{-\\Delta}}{2}$ and the period $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$.\n10. Round the final period $T$ to $3$ decimal places.\n\nThis procedure is robust and directly follows from the problem statement.
