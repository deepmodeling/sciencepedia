It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, providing all necessary information for a rigorous solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the fractional occupancy of lipid A binding sites by a polymyxin antibiotic. Let $P$ represent the free polymyxin antibiotic (the ligand) and $S$ represent the free lipid A binding site. The binding reaction forms a complex $PS$. The process is assumed to be a reversible bimolecular reaction at equilibrium:\n$$ P + S \\rightleftharpoons PS $$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action at equilibrium:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[P][S]}{[PS]} $$\nwhere $[P]$ is the molar concentration of free polymyxin, $[S]$ is the molar concentration of free binding sites, and $[PS]$ is the molar concentration of the bound complex.\n\nThe problem states that the extracellular free drug concentration is $C$.

Thus, the fractional occupancy is $0.800$.\n\nFinally, we address the qualitative question regarding outer membrane permeability. The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is stabilized by electrostatic interactions. Specifically, the negatively charged phosphate groups of lipid A are cross-linked by divalent cations, primarily $\\text{Mg}^{2+}$ and $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$. This ionic network is critical for maintaining the low permeability and structural integrity of the outer membrane. Polymyxins are cationic molecules that have a high affinity for the anionic phosphate groups on lipid A. The binding of polymyxin displaces the stabilizing divalent cations. This neutralization of charge and steric disruption weakens the electrostatic interactions holding the lipopolysaccharide molecules together. Consequently, the local structure of the outer membrane is destabilized, leading to an increase in its permeability. A high fractional occupancy, such as the calculated $\\theta = 0.800$, indicates substantial binding and charge neutralization, and would therefore be expected to significantly **increase** outer membrane permeability, which is the key mechanism of polymyxin's bactericidal action against Gram-negative bacteria.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.800}$$", "id": "4682575"}, {"introduction": "A crucial aspect of antibiotic pharmacology is understanding how bacteria evolve resistance.
