## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The principles governing the mechanism, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of polymyxins, as detailed in the preceding chapters, find their ultimate expression in the complex and diverse ways these agents are utilized, studied, and managed across a range of scientific and medical disciplines. As last-resort antibiotics, their application is fraught with challenges that demand a sophisticated, interdisciplinary understanding. This chapter explores these applications, moving from the foundational pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic complexities that dictate their behavior to their use in nuanced clinical scenarios, and finally to the global public health challenges of resistance and the future of their development. The central theme is one of a continuous balance: achieving sufficient antimicrobial effect against highly resistant pathogens while navigating a narrow therapeutic window defined by significant toxicity and complex pharmacology.

### Foundational Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Challenges

The unique physicochemical structure of the polymyxins as cationic, amphipathic lipopeptides is the origin of not only their antimicrobial activity but also several profound practical challenges in their delivery and laboratory assessment.

#### Physicochemical Properties and Drug Delivery

A significant and often underappreciated challenge in the clinical administration of polymyxins is their propensity to adsorb to surfaces. Due to their cationic and hydrophobic nature, polymyxins readily bind to many materials used in standard infusion equipment, particularly plastics like polyvinyl chloride (PVC). This "stickiness" can lead to substantial drug loss from the solution before it ever reaches the patient. Quantitative models, though simplified, reveal the magnitude of this effect. During a prolonged infusion, a significant fraction of the initial dose can be inreversibly adsorbed onto the inner surfaces of PVC bags and tubing. This loss is not uniform over time; rather, it is most pronounced at the beginning of the infusion as the drug rapidly saturates the available binding sites on the material. In contrast, materials like [borosilicate glass](@entry_id:152086) exhibit much lower adsorption capacity. This phenomenon underscores the critical importance of materials science in clinical pharmacology; the choice of infusion apparatus can significantly alter the delivered dose, potentially leading to sub-therapeutic exposure, especially during the crucial initial phase of treatment [@problem_id:4682514].

#### The Challenge of Susceptibility Testing

The same physicochemical properties that cause polymyxins to adsorb to infusion sets also complicate their *in vitro* susceptibility testing, a cornerstone of [clinical microbiology](@entry_id:164677). Achieving accurate and reproducible Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values requires a highly standardized protocol that specifically accounts for the drug's behavior. International standards bodies, such as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), have established a reference method for colistin broth microdilution that directly addresses these challenges.

This protocol mandates the use of specific materials and reagents to ensure the nominal drug concentration in the test well reflects the true concentration available to the bacteria. Key components include: (1) using colistin sulfate, the active form of the drug, for preparing dilutions, rather than the inactive prodrug colistimethate sodium (CMS); (2) employing cation-adjusted Mueller–Hinton broth (CAMHB) to standardize the concentration of divalent cations ($Ca^{2+}$ and $Mg^{2+}$), which are known competitive antagonists of polymyxin binding to [lipopolysaccharide](@entry_id:188695) (LPS); and (3) utilizing non-adsorptive, untreated polystyrene microplates to minimize drug loss to the vessel walls. The use of [surfactants](@entry_id:167769) like polysorbate 80, which might seem like a logical way to prevent adsorption, is explicitly contraindicated as they can interfere with the polymyxin's mechanism at the [bacterial membrane](@entry_id:192857), leading to falsely low MICs. These rigorous specifications highlight how a drug's fundamental chemistry directly dictates the laboratory methods required for its reliable clinical use [@problem_id:4682529].

#### The Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Index: Quantifying Exposure and Effect

To rationally dose polymyxins and predict their efficacy, clinicians and researchers rely on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) indices that relate drug exposure to antimicrobial effect. For polymyxins, the killing action is concentration-dependent but also saturable. A simple mathematical model of bacterial growth and kill, where the kill rate $k$ is a saturable function of the free drug concentration $C_f(t)$, demonstrates that the total bacterial kill over a dosing interval is determined by the integral of this kill rate over time, $\int k(C_f(t)) dt$. Because the kill rate saturates at higher concentrations, simply achieving a high peak concentration ($C_{\max}$) may not be the best predictor of overall effect, as it ignores the duration of exposure.

Instead, the most reliable PK/PD index for polymyxins has been established as the ratio of the 24-hour free-drug Area Under the Curve to the MIC, denoted as $f\text{AUC}_{0-24}/\text{MIC}$. The AUC integrates the free drug concentration over the entire dosing interval, thus capturing both the magnitude and duration of exposure. By normalizing this total exposure to the pathogen's susceptibility (MIC), the index provides a robust measure that correlates with efficacy across different dosing regimens, drug formulations (e.g., polymyxin B vs. colistin from its prodrug), and pathogens. This index serves as the primary target for dose optimization in clinical practice [@problem_id:4682528].

### Clinical Applications and Therapeutic Strategies

The clinical utility of polymyxins has evolved dramatically. Initially confined to topical use due to systemic toxicity, they have been resurrected as essential systemic agents for treating multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections. This section explores their application across this spectrum, from localized therapy to complex systemic use in critically ill patients.

#### The Principle of Selective Toxicity and Its Limits

The fundamental reason for the historical restriction of polymyxins to topical applications lies in their limited [selective toxicity](@entry_id:139535). Their mechanism of action—the detergent-like disruption of phospholipid membranes—is not exclusively specific to bacteria. While initial binding is favored by the anionic LPS on Gram-negative bacteria, at the concentrations achieved during systemic administration, polymyxins can also bind to and disrupt the membranes of eukaryotic host cells. This non-specific membrane activity is the basis for their two major dose-dependent toxicities: nephrotoxicity, resulting from damage to renal tubular epithelial cells, and [neurotoxicity](@entry_id:170532). This inherent risk of host cell damage has always been the primary barrier to their systemic use and remains the central challenge in modern therapy [@problem_id:2051732].

#### Topical and Localized Therapy

Given the risks of systemic administration, polymyxins have long been mainstays in topical preparations where high local concentrations can be achieved with minimal systemic absorption.

In ophthalmology, a combination of polymyxin B and trimethoprim is a standard treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis. This combination leverages complementary spectra: polymyxin B provides bactericidal activity against many Gram-negative organisms, including *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, while [trimethoprim](@entry_id:164069), an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, covers common Gram-positive cocci and *Haemophilus* species. A critical clinical consideration arises in patients who wear contact lenses, as they are at a significantly heightened risk for developing sight-threatening keratitis caused by *P. aeruginosa*. In this high-risk scenario, even if only conjunctivitis is present, clinicians often add or switch to a topical fluoroquinolone. This is justified by the superior corneal penetration and robust, concentration-dependent killing of *P. aeruginosa* by fluoroquinolones, which provides a more reliable means of preventing progression to a corneal ulcer [@problem_id:4729896].

Similarly, in otolaryngology, combination otic drops containing polymyxin B are used for external otitis, often caused by *P. aeruginosa* or *Staphylococcus aureus*. The binding of cationic polymyxin B to the anionic lipid A of LPS is a competitive process, antagonized by divalent cations like $Mg^{2+}$ that normally stabilize the outer membrane. This principle is demonstrable in vitro, where the binding affinity of polymyxin B decreases in the presence of $Mg^{2+}$. Clinically, polymyxin B is often combined with neomycin (to broaden Gram-positive coverage) and hydrocortisone (to reduce inflammation). Such combinations can exhibit additive or synergistic effects against pathogens like *P. aeruginosa*. However, these preparations carry risks, including allergic [contact dermatitis](@entry_id:191008) from neomycin and ototoxicity if the tympanic membrane is perforated, a scenario in which safer alternatives like fluoroquinolone drops are preferred [@problem_id:4474018].

#### Systemic Therapy in the Era of Multidrug Resistance

The rise of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens has forced the reintroduction of systemic polymyxins as last-resort therapies. This use is defined by formidable pharmacokinetic and clinical challenges.

##### Dosing Complexities

Administering polymyxins systemically is far from straightforward. For colistin, the challenge is compounded by its administration as an inactive prodrug, colistimethate sodium (CMS). A common clinical task is to administer a loading dose to rapidly achieve a therapeutic concentration. While a simple one-compartment model can be used to calculate the theoretical amount of active colistin base activity (CBA) required to reach a target concentration (e.g., $LD = C_{\text{target}} \times V_d$), the actual administered dose of CMS must be vastly larger. This is because only a fraction of the CMS dose is converted *in vivo* to active colistin; the rest is eliminated, primarily by the kidneys, before conversion can occur. This slow, inefficient conversion and competing clearance pathway means a much larger loading dose of the prodrug is needed to generate the required amount of active drug in a timely manner [@problem_id:4682548].

The complexity escalates in critically ill patients requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The clearance of both the prodrug (CMS) and the active drug (colistin) by the CRRT circuit must be considered. CMS, being a smaller and less protein-bound molecule, is cleared much more efficiently by CRRT than the larger, more protein-bound colistin. This high rate of prodrug removal means that, for a given CMS dose, less is available for conversion to active colistin. Consequently, to achieve a therapeutic colistin concentration, the CMS maintenance dose in a patient on CRRT must be substantially higher than in an anuric patient not on CRRT, often approaching the dose used in patients with normal renal function. Further complexities include drug adsorption to the filter membrane, which may necessitate a supplemental dose when a new circuit is started, and the modality of CRRT (e.g., predilution vs. postdilution), which can alter clearance rates [@problem_id:4682569].

##### Optimizing Therapy in Severe Infections

Achieving adequate drug concentrations at the site of infection is paramount. In ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), polymyxins face the additional hurdle of poor penetration into the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of the lungs. Even at systemic doses that approach the threshold for nephrotoxicity, the free drug concentration in the ELF may remain below the MIC of the causative pathogen. This therapeutic dilemma often necessitates a combination of intravenous and inhaled therapy. Intravenous administration provides systemic drug levels, while direct nebulization of polymyxins into the lungs can achieve very high local concentrations in the ELF—well above the MIC—with minimal contribution to systemic exposure and toxicity. This dual-route strategy is a key example of leveraging formulation and delivery to decouple local efficacy from systemic toxicity [@problem_id:4682499].

In contrast, for deep-seated biofilm-associated infections, such as a chronic prosthetic joint infection (PJI), polymyxins are generally poor choices. Biofilms confer profound [antibiotic tolerance](@entry_id:186945), reflected in minimal biofilm eradication concentrations (MBEC) that can be orders of magnitude higher than planktonic MICs. The combination of poor penetration into bone and joint tissues and the extremely high concentrations required to act on biofilms makes eradication with systemic polymyxins virtually impossible. In such cases, the cornerstone of management is surgical source control—removal of the infected hardware—coupled with a systemic antibiotic regimen chosen for its ability to suppress residual planktonic bacteria, for which other agents like cefiderocol may be better suited [@problem_id:4655449].

##### Combination Therapy and Synergy

Given the limitations of polymyxin monotherapy, combination therapy is a standard of practice. The rationale for many combinations stems directly from the polymyxin's membrane-disrupting mechanism. By permeabilizing the Gram-negative outer membrane, polymyxins can act as adjuvants, facilitating the entry of other antibiotics that are normally excluded. This is the basis for synergy with drugs like [rifampin](@entry_id:176949) and tetracyclines, whose targets are intracellular (RNA polymerase and the ribosome, respectively). For carbapenem-resistant organisms where resistance is due to porin loss, polymyxins can create an alternative entry pathway for carbapenems to reach their periplasmic PBP targets. Furthermore, by partially depolarizing the cytoplasmic membrane and dissipating the proton motive force, polymyxins can also inhibit the action of proton-dependent [efflux pumps](@entry_id:142499), another common resistance mechanism. These synergistic interactions can restore the activity of older antibiotics and, by creating a "two-hit" paradigm against distinct targets, can also help suppress the emergence of resistance [@problem_id:4682530].

#### Rational Empiric Therapy and Antimicrobial Stewardship

While polymyxins are powerful tools, their toxicity and the availability of newer, safer agents demand careful stewardship. The decision to use a polymyxin empirically in a critically ill patient with a suspected MDR infection should be guided by local epidemiological data. For instance, in a patient with suspected CRE bacteremia, the optimal empiric regimen is one that maximizes the probability of activity against the locally prevalent carbapenemase types. By analyzing the local antibiogram, one might find that a combination of newer β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors (e.g., ceftazidime-avibactam plus aztreonam) provides a very high probability of coverage (>90%). In such a scenario, even if a polymyxin-containing regimen offers a slightly higher calculated probability of coverage, the guiding principles of antimicrobial stewardship—to use the safest effective agent—would favor the β-lactam-based regimen, reserving the polymyxin for situations where no safer alternative is viable [@problem_id:4871856].

### The Global Challenge of Polymyxin Resistance and Future Directions

The resurgence of polymyxins has been shadowed by the emergence and global spread of resistance, a problem that transcends the clinic and engages public health, agriculture, and drug development.

#### The One Health Perspective: Agricultural Use and Resistance Mobilization

For decades, colistin was widely used in animal agriculture at subtherapeutic doses as a growth promoter. This practice created a vast reservoir of selective pressure. The principle of the minimal selective concentration (MSC)—the lowest antibiotic concentration at which a resistant strain has a fitness advantage over a susceptible one—is key to understanding this phenomenon. Continuous low-dose exposure in animal guts created conditions where concentrations were often below the MIC of susceptible bacteria but above the MSC, providing a sustained selective advantage for any bacteria that acquired resistance. This environment was the crucible for the emergence and amplification of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance genes, most notably *mcr-1* [@problem_id:4682545].

The discovery of *mcr-1* on a mobile plasmid in 2015 was a landmark event in public health. It signified that resistance to a last-resort human antibiotic was no longer confined to slow-spreading [chromosomal mutations](@entry_id:170879) but had become "mobilized," capable of rapid horizontal gene transfer between bacteria. The subsequent identification of *mcr-1* in bacteria from food animals, retail meat, and human patients provided definitive evidence of a One Health crisis, where antibiotic use in one sector (agriculture) directly threatened human health in another (medicine). This discovery prompted a global policy response, leading many countries to ban or severely restrict the use of polymyxins in food animals, a critical step in preserving their efficacy for human medicine [@problem_id:4738599].

#### The Future: Engineering Better Polymyxins

The clinical need for agents active against MDR Gram-negative bacteria remains acute, driving efforts to engineer next-generation polymyxins with an improved therapeutic index. The goal of this [medicinal chemistry](@entry_id:178806) research is to decouple the antibacterial activity from the host toxicity. The design strategies are directly informed by the mechanistic principles of action and toxicity.

One major approach is to tune the molecule's hydrophobicity. By modifying the N-terminal fatty acyl tail to be less hydrophobic, it is possible to reduce non-specific insertion into mammalian cell membranes while preserving the positive charge necessary for initial binding to bacterial LPS. Another sophisticated strategy is to introduce steric bulk or polar groups near the sites responsible for uptake by kidney cells (e.g., via the megalin/cubilin receptors), thereby blocking a key pathway of nephrotoxicity. A third innovative direction is to re-purpose the polymyxin scaffold to function primarily as an outer membrane permeabilizer. Such an analog would be designed to retain high-affinity LPS binding but have minimal intrinsic bactericidal activity, effectively acting as a safe adjuvant that allows other antibiotics to enter and kill the pathogen. These strategies represent a rational, mechanism-based approach to [drug design](@entry_id:140420), aiming to create safer, more effective polymyxin-class agents for the future [@problem_id:4682554].
