Consider a small-molecule competitive inhibitor of neuraminidase, where the enzyme follows Michaelis–Menten kinetics under initial-rate conditions, and competitive inhibition increases the apparent Michaelis constant such that the initial velocity in the presence of inhibitor concentration $[I]$ is given by $v = \\dfrac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_{m}\\left(1 + \\dfrac{[I]}{K_{i}}\\right) + [S]}$, while the uninhibited initial velocity is $v_{0} = \\dfrac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_{m} + [S]}$.

The problem describes competitive enzyme inhibition using the standard Michaelis–Menten kinetic model. The provided equations for the initial velocity in the absence ($v_{0}$) and presence ($v$) of a competitive inhibitor are correct. The definition of the $IC_{50}$ is standard. The provided numerical values for the substrate concentration $[S]$, the Michaelis constant $K_m$, and the $IC_{50}$ are physically realistic for a potent enzyme inhibitor system, such as a neuraminidase inhibitor. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and asks for a standard derivation and calculation based on fundamental principles of enzyme kinetics. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe derivation of the inhibition constant, $K_i$, begins with the definition of $IC_{50}$. The $IC_{50}$ is the inhibitor concentration, $[I]$, that reduces the initial reaction velocity, $v$, to $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the uninhibited velocity, $v_0$, at a fixed substrate concentration, $[S]$.\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ v = \\frac{1}{2} v_{0} \\quad \\text{when} \\quad [I] = IC_{50} $$\nThe problem provides the expressions for the inhibited and uninhibited velocities:\n$$ v = \\dfrac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_{m}\\left(1 + \\dfrac{[I]}{K_{i}}\\right) + [S]} $$\n$$ v_{0} = \\dfrac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_{m} + [S]} $$\nSubstituting these expressions into the definition of $IC_{50}$ (with $[I]$ set to $IC_{50}$):\n$$ \\dfrac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_{m}\\left(1 + \\dfrac{IC_{50}}{K_{i}}\\right) + [S]} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\dfrac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_{m} + [S]} \\right) $$\nThe term $V_{\\max}[S]$ is present in the numerator on both sides and can be canceled, as it is non-$0$:\n$$ \\dfrac{1}{K_{m}\\left(1 + \\dfrac{IC_{50}}{K_{i}}\\right) + [S]} = \\dfrac{1}{2(K_{m} + [S])} $$\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides of the equation yields:\n$$ K_{m}\\left(1 + \\dfrac{IC_{50}}{K_{i}}\\right) + [S] = 2(K_{m} + [S]) $$\nWe can now expand and rearrange the equation to solve for $K_i$.\n$$ K_{m} + K_{m}\\left(\\dfrac{IC_{50}}{K_{i}}\\right) + [S] = 2K_{m} + 2[S] $$\nIsolating the term containing $K_i$:\n$$ K_{m}\\left(\\dfrac{IC_{50}}{K_{i}}\\right) = (2K_{m} - K_{m}) + (2[S] - [S]) $$\n$$ K_{m}\\left(\\dfrac{IC_{50}}{K_{i}}\\right) = K_{m} + [S] $$\nTo solve for $K_i$, we first isolate the fraction $\\dfrac{IC_{50}}{K_{i}}$:\n$$ \\dfrac{IC_{50}}{K_{i}} = \\dfrac{K_{m} + [S]}{K_{m}} = 1 + \\dfrac{[S]}{K_{m}} $$\nFinally, we solve for $K_i$:\n$$ K_{i} = \\dfrac{IC_{50}}{1 + \\dfrac{[S]}{K_{m}}} $$\nThis expression, known as the Cheng-Prusoff equation for competitive inhibitors, gives the inhibition constant $K_i$ in terms of the experimentally determined $IC_{50}$, the substrate concentration $[S]$, and the Michaelis constant $K_m$.\n\nNext, we evaluate $K_i$ using the provided numerical values:\nSubstrate concentration: $[S] = 50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$\nMichaelis constant: $K_{m} = 25\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$\nInhibitory concentration $IC_{50}$: $IC_{50} = 2\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nBefore substituting the values, we note that the units for $[S]$ and $K_m$ are identical ($\\mathrm{\\mu M}$), so their ratio will be a dimensionless quantity, as required. The resulting unit for $K_i$ will be the same as the unit for $IC_{50}$, which is $\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the dimensionless ratio $\\dfrac{[S]}{K_{m}}$:\n$$ \\dfrac{[S]}{K_{m}} = \\dfrac{50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}}{25\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}} = 2 $$\nNow substitute this ratio and the value of $IC_{50}$ into the derived expression for $K_i$:\n$$ K_{i} = \\dfrac{2\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{1 + 2} = \\dfrac{2}{3}\\,\\mathrm{nM} $$\nThe problem requires the final numerical value to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$ K_{i} = 0.66666... \\,\\mathrm{nM} \\approx 0.6667\\,\\mathrm{nM} $$\n\nThe inhibition constant $K_i$ represents the dissociation constant of the enzyme-inhibitor complex.

The standard binding free energy, $\\Delta G^\\circ$, is a direct measure of binding favorability; a more negative $\\Delta G^\\circ$ signifies a more favorable (stronger) interaction.\n\nThe mutation H275Y causes the $K_d$ to increase from $1\\,\\text{nM}$ to $50\\,\\text{nM}$. This indicates a $50$-fold reduction in the binding affinity of the inhibitor for the neuraminidase enzyme. Our calculation yielded a positive value for $\\Delta\\Delta G = \\Delta G^{\\text{H275Y}} - \\Delta G^{\\text{wt}} \\approx +10.1\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$. This positive value quantitatively shows that the binding of the inhibitor to the mutant enzyme is thermodynamically less favorable by $10.1\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$ compared to the wild-type. This loss of favorable binding energy is the direct thermodynamic cause of drug resistance. To achieve the same level of enzymatic inhibition in the mutant, a significantly higher concentration of the inhibitor drug would be required to overcome the weaker binding, which is the clinical definition of resistance.\n\n**Fitness Cost of H275Y in the Absence of Drug:**\nFrom first principles, an enzyme's active site is the product of evolutionary optimization to efficiently bind its natural substrate and catalyze its transformation. The active site of neuraminidase is optimized to bind and cleave sialic acid from host cell glycoproteins, a crucial step for the release of progeny virions. The competitive inhibitor used as a drug is designed to be a substrate analog, mimicking the structure of sialic acid to bind tightly to the active site.\n\nA mutation like H275Y, which occurs in the active site and significantly alters the affinity for a substrate analog (the inhibitor), is highly likely to also affect the enzyme's interaction with its natural substrate, sialic acid. The substitution of histidine with tyrosine changes key properties of the active site microenvironment, including steric bulk, charge distribution, and hydrogen-bonding potential.\n\nFrom a thermodynamic and kinetic perspective, this perturbation will likely impact the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, as described by the Michaelis-Menten parameters, $K_M$ and $k_{\\text{cat}}$:\n1.  **Substrate Binding ($K_M$):** The mutation might disrupt the optimal interactions required for binding sialic acid, leading to weaker substrate binding. This would be observed as an increase in the Michaelis constant, $K_M$.\n2.  **Catalytic Rate ($k_{\\text{cat}}$):** The specific geometry and electronic configuration of the active site are critical for stabilizing the transition state of the reaction. The H275Y substitution may destabilize this transition state, thereby reducing the catalytic turnover number, $k_{\\text{cat}}$.\n\nThe overall catalytic efficiency is given by the ratio $k_{\\text{cat}}/K_M$. A decrease in this ratio indicates a less efficient enzyme. For the influenza virus, reduced neuraminidase efficiency translates to a slower rate of virion budding and release from infected cells. This impairment of the viral replication cycle in the absence of drug pressure is known as a \"fitness cost\". Therefore, while the H275Y mutation confers a significant survival advantage in the presence of the neuraminidase inhibitor, it is likely to be deleterious to the virus in a drug-free environment, leading to reduced viral fitness compared to the wild-type strain. This fitness cost explains why such resistance mutations often remain at low frequencies in the viral population until selective pressure from drug treatment is applied.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{10.1}\n$$", "id": "4673079"}]}
