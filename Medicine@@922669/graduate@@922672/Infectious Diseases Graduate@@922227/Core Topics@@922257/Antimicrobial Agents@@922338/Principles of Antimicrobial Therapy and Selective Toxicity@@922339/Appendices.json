No rounding is necessary. No units should be included in the final answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the construction and calculation of a selectivity index ($SI$) for a new antimicrobial candidate and an evaluation of its adequacy for systemic use based on a stated pharmacological principle.\n\nFirst, we must construct the simplest dimensionless ratio that quantifies selective toxicity. The principle of selective toxicity dictates that an ideal antimicrobial agent should be highly effective against the target pathogen at concentrations that are not harmful to the host. The problem provides two metrics: the half maximal effective concentration ($EC_{50}$), which represents the concentration for antimicrobial effect, and the fifty percent cytotoxic concentration ($CC_{50}$), which represents the concentration for host cytotoxicity.\n\nA high degree of selectivity implies that the concentration required to harm host cells ($CC_{50}$) is much greater than the concentration required to inhibit the pathogen ($EC_{50}$). To create a selectivity index ($SI$) where a higher value corresponds to greater (i.e., more favorable) selectivity, the characteristic concentration for host cytotoxicity must be in the numerator, and the characteristic concentration for antimicrobial effect must be in the denominator. This yields the simplest dimensionless ratio:\n$$SI = \\frac{CC_{50}}{EC_{50}}$$\nThe problem states that both concentrations are measured in units of milligrams per liter ($\\mathrm{mg/L}$). Since the units in the numerator and denominator are identical, they cancel, rendering the $SI$ dimensionless as required.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of the $SI$ using the provided data. The given values are:\n$$EC_{50} = 2\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$$\n$$CC_{50} = 40\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$$\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the selectivity index:\n$$SI = \\frac{40\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}}{2\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}} = 20$$\nThe numerical value of the selectivity index is $20$.\n\nFinally, we must determine if this level of selectivity is adequate for systemic use. The problem provides the guiding principle that safe systemic therapy requires at least an order-of-magnitude separation between host-cytotoxic and antimicrobial-effective concentrations. An order of magnitude corresponds to a factor of $10$. Therefore, for a drug candidate to be considered to have adequate selectivity for systemic use, its selectivity index must be at least $10$.\nThe required condition is:\n$$SI \\geq 10$$\nOur calculated value is $SI = 20$. Comparing our calculated value to the required threshold:\n$$20 \\geq 10$$\nThis inequality is true. The calculated selectivity index of $20$ exceeds the minimum threshold of $10$. This means the concentration of the drug needed to cause $50\\%$ cytotoxicity in human cells is $20$ times higher than the concentration needed to achieve half of its maximal effect against the pathogen. This separation is greater than one order of magnitude, thus satisfying the stated criterion for adequate therapeutic selectivity. Therefore, based on this in vitro assessment and the provided principle, the drug candidate demonstrates sufficient selective toxicity to warrant further investigation for systemic use.\nThe final answer required is only the numerical value of the selectivity index.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$", "id": "4684107"}, {"introduction": "While a high Selectivity Index is desirable, its origin lies in the molecular interactions between a drug and its targets. This practice delves into this molecular basis by modeling how differential binding affinity for a bacterial enzyme versus a homologous human enzyme dictates the therapeutic window.

Substituting this into the equation for $TI^{*}$:\n$$TI^{*} = \\frac{0.25 (100 K_{i,B})}{9 K_{i,B}}$$\nThe term $K_{i,B}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding a pure, dimensionless number that depends only on the selectivity of the inhibitor and the chosen thresholds for efficacy and toxicity.\n$$TI^{*} = \\frac{25}{9}$$\nTo provide a numerical answer rounded to four significant figures:\n$$TI^{*} = 2.7777... \\approx 2.778$$\n\nRegarding the implication of this value for the risk of off-target effects, a $TI^{*}$ of approximately $2.778$ signifies a narrow therapeutic window. It means that the drug concentration required to induce the defined toxic effect ($C_{\\mathrm{TD}^{*}}$) is only about $2.78$ times greater than the concentration required for the desired therapeutic effect ($C_{\\mathrm{ED}^{*}}$). Within this simplified model, this implies a high risk of off-target toxicity, especially at high doses. A small overdose, or any patient-specific factors that increase the effective drug concentration by a factor of less than $3$, could push the off-target inhibition past the toxic threshold of $f^{*}_{H} = 0.20$. The concentration-response curves for efficacy and toxicity are very close. Specifically, at the minimally effective dose $C = C_{\\mathrm{ED}^{*}} = 9 K_{i,B}$, the off-target fractional inhibition is $f_{H} = \\frac{9 K_{i,B}}{9 K_{i,B} + K_{i,H}} = \\frac{9 K_{i,B}}{9 K_{i,B} + 100 K_{i,B}} = \\frac{9}{109} \\approx 0.0826$, or $8.26\\%$. This is already a substantial fraction of the $20\\%$ toxic threshold, indicating that even at the therapeutic dose, there is significant engagement with the off-target enzyme. Therefore, the margin of safety is small, and dose escalation would rapidly increase the risk of toxicity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2.778}\n$$", "id": "4684129"}, {"introduction": "An effective antimicrobial strategy can be undermined by the evolution of resistance within the target pathogen population. In this exercise, you will model one of the most common resistance mechanisms: active efflux pumps, which expel the drug from the bacterial cell. By deriving the steady-state intracellular drug concentration, you will quantify how increased efflux activity can confer resistance and determine the necessary dose adjustment to overcome it [@problem_id:4684150].", "problem": "A bacterium is exposed to an antimicrobial agent whose intracellular activity requires maintaining the intracellular free concentration above a threshold that yields target engagement sufficient for inhibition. Consider a single well-mixed bacterial cell with extracellular concentration $C_{e}$ and intracellular concentration $C_{i}$. Assume the following are valid in the concentration range of interest: the membrane-mediated passive bidirectional transport can be approximated by Fick’s law across a thin barrier, and the active efflux is operating in the low-saturation regime such that it can be approximated by first-order kinetics with respect to $C_{i}$. Let the effective rate constant that maps passive flux into an intracellular concentration change be $k_{d}$ (arising from permeability times area divided by intracellular volume), and let the first-order efflux rate constant be $k_{e}$.\n\nStarting from the mass balance, derive the steady-state relationship between $C_{i}$ and $C_{e}$ in the presence of passive diffusion and active efflux. Use that to provide a mechanistic rationalization of how increased efflux shifts $C_{i}$ below the therapeutic level required for target inhibition.

Round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the steady-state intracellular drug concentration, a mechanistic rationalization of efflux-mediated resistance, and the calculation of the fold increase in dose required to overcome a specific increase in efflux capacity.\n\nFirst, we establish the mass balance for the intracellular drug concentration, $C_i$. The rate of change of $C_i$ with respect to time, $t$, is determined by the sum of fluxes into and out of the cell.\nLet the intracellular volume be $V$. The rate of change of the number of moles of the drug inside the cell, $n_i$, is given by:\n$$ \\frac{dn_i}{dt} = \\text{Influx Rate} - \\text{Efflux Rate} $$\nSince $n_i = C_i V$, and assuming constant volume $V$, we have $\\frac{dn_i}{dt} = V \\frac{dC_i}{dt}$.\nThe problem specifies two transport mechanisms:\n$1$. Passive bidirectional transport, which follows Fick's law. The net flux is proportional to the concentration difference $(C_e - C_i)$. The problem provides an effective rate constant $k_d$ that maps this flux into a concentration change. Thus, the rate of change of $C_i$ due to passive transport is $k_d(C_e - C_i)$. This term accounts for passive influx ($k_d C_e$) and passive efflux ($-k_d C_i$).\n$2$. Active efflux, which is approximated by first-order kinetics with respect to $C_i$. The rate constant is given as $k_e$. This contributes a term $-k_e C_i$ to the rate of change of the intracellular concentration.\n\nCombining these terms, the differential equation governing the intracellular concentration $C_i$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dC_i}{dt} = k_d (C_e - C_i) - k_e C_i $$\nThis equation represents the mass balance within the well-mixed cell. To find the steady-state relationship, we set the rate of change of $C_i$ to zero, i.e., $\\frac{dC_i}{dt} = 0$.\n$$ 0 = k_d (C_e - C_i) - k_e C_i $$\nWe now solve for the steady-state intracellular concentration, $C_i$, as a function of the extracellular concentration, $C_e$:\n$$ k_d C_e - k_d C_i - k_e C_i = 0 $$\n$$ k_d C_e = (k_d + k_e) C_i $$\n$$ C_i = \\left(\\frac{k_d}{k_d + k_e}\\right) C_e $$\nThis is the steady-state relationship between the intracellular and extracellular concentrations.\n\nNext, we provide a mechanistic rationalization for how increased efflux leads to resistance. The derived relationship shows that $C_i$ is proportional to $C_e$, with the constant of proportionality being the accumulation ratio $R = \\frac{k_d}{k_d + k_e}$. This ratio is always less than $1$ for non-zero efflux ($k_e > 0$). The active efflux rate constant $k_e$ appears in the denominator. If a bacterial mutation leads to an increase in efflux capacity (e.g., through upregulation or mutation of efflux pumps), the value of $k_e$ increases. As $k_e$ increases, the denominator $(k_d + k_e)$ increases, and consequently, the accumulation ratio $R$ decreases. For a fixed extracellular concentration $C_e$, a smaller accumulation ratio results in a lower steady-state intracellular concentration $C_i$. If this reduced $C_i$ falls below the minimum therapeutic threshold $C_i^{\\ast}$ required for target engagement and inhibition, the antimicrobial agent becomes ineffective, and the bacterium exhibits resistance.\n\nNow, we proceed with the quantitative part of the problem. We are given the relationship between the extracellular concentration and the systemic dose $D$ as $C_e = \\alpha D$, where $\\alpha$ is a proportionality constant.
