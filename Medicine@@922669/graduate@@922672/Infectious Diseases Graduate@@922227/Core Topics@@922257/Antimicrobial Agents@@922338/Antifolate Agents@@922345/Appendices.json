The modified Michaelis-Menten equation for the initial velocity in the presence of a competitive inhibitor, $v_i$, is:\n$$v_i = \\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m' + [S]}$$\nThe apparent Michaelis constant, $K_m'$, is related to the true Michaelis constant, $K_m$, by the factor $(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i})$:\n$$K_m' = K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this expression for $K_m'$ into the equation for $v_i$ gives:\n$$v_i = \\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]}$$\nThe problem asks for the fractional activity, $\\alpha$, which is defined as the ratio $\\frac{v_i}{v_0}$ at the same substrate concentration $[S]$.\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{v_i}{v_0} = \\frac{\\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]}}{\\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m + [S]}}$$\nThe term $V_{max}[S]$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator, yielding the final expression for fractional activity under competitive inhibition:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{K_m + [S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]}$$\nThis is the derived expression for $\\alpha$.\n\n### Numerical Computation\nNow, we substitute the provided values into this expression:\n- $[S] = 100~\\mu\\text{M}$\n- $[I] = 50~\\mu\\text{M}$\n- $K_m = 5~\\mu\\text{M}$\n- $K_i = 2~\\mu\\text{M}$\n\nThe units ($\\mu\\text{M}$) are consistent and will cancel out, so we can work with the numerical values.\nFirst, compute the inhibitory term:\n$$1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i} = 1 + \\frac{50}{2} = 1 + 25 = 26$$\nNow, substitute all values into the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{5 + 100}{5(26) + 100}$$\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{105}{130 + 100}$$\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{105}{230}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\\alpha \\approx 0.456521739...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\\alpha \\approx 0.4565$$\nThis value represents that at the given concentrations of substrate and inhibitor, the enzyme DHPS is operating at approximately $45.65\\%$ of the activity it would have without the sulfonamide present.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4565}$$", "id": "4621724"}, {"introduction": "Acquired drug resistance is a primary cause of treatment failure, and for antifolates, this often involves mutations in the target enzyme.

The reasoning proceeds as follows.\n\nThe system describes the competitive inhibition of an enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), by an inhibitor (I), pyrimethamine, in the presence of its substrate (S), dihydrofolate. At steady state, the enzyme exists in three forms: free enzyme ($E$), enzyme-substrate complex ($ES$), and enzyme-inhibitor complex ($EI$). The total enzyme concentration, $[E]_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is conserved:\n$$ [E]_{\\mathrm{total}} = [E] + [ES] + [EI] $$\nThe problem is based on the concept of \"inhibitor target occupancy,\" which is defined as the fraction of the total enzyme population that is bound by the inhibitor. Let this occupancy be denoted by $\\theta_{I}$.\n$$ \\theta_{I} = \\frac{[EI]}{[E]_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{[EI]}{[E] + [ES] + [EI]} $$\nThe problem requires using mass-action equilibrium definitions. The dissociation constants for the substrate ($K_{m}$) and the inhibitor ($K_{i}$) are given by:\n$$ K_{m} = \\frac{[E][S]}{[ES]} \\implies [ES] = \\frac{[E][S]}{K_{m}} $$\n$$ K_{i} = \\frac{[E][I]}{[EI]} \\implies [EI] = \\frac{[E][I]}{K_{i}} $$\nSubstituting these expressions for $[ES]$ and $[EI]$ into the equation for $\\theta_{I}$ allows us to express the occupancy in terms of free ligand concentrations and dissociation constants:\n$$ \\theta_{I} = \\frac{\\frac{[E][I]}{K_{i}}}{[E] + \\frac{[E][S]}{K_{m}} + \\frac{[E][I]}{K_{i}}} $$\nThe concentration of free enzyme, $[E]$, appears in every term and can be cancelled out:\n$$ \\theta_{I} = \\frac{\\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}}{1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_{m}} + \\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}} $$\nThis equation provides a general expression for inhibitor target occupancy in a single-site competitive binding system at equilibrium.\n\nThe central condition of the problem is that the inhibitor target occupancy must be maintained at an equivalent level for both the wild-type (wt) and mutant (mut) enzymes. Therefore, $\\theta_{I, \\mathrm{wt}} = \\theta_{I, \\mathrm{mut}}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{wt}}}{K_{i,\\mathrm{wt}}}}{1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_{m}} + \\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{wt}}}{K_{i,\\mathrm{wt}}}} = \\frac{\\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_{i,\\mathrm{mut}}}}{1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_{m}} + \\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_{i,\\mathrm{mut}}}} $$\nThe problem states that the substrate concentration $[S]$ and the Michaelis constant $K_{m}$ are the same for both wild-type and mutant conditions. Consequently, the term $1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_{m}}$ is a constant for both sides of the equation. Let us represent this constant denominator term as $C = 1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_{m}}$.\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{\\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{wt}}}{K_{i,\\mathrm{wt}}}}{C + \\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{wt}}}{K_{i,\\mathrm{wt}}}} = \\frac{\\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_{i,\\mathrm{mut}}}}{C + \\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_{i,\\mathrm{mut}}}} $$\nLet $x = \\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{wt}}}{K_{i,\\mathrm{wt}}}$ and $y = \\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_{i,\\mathrm{mut}}}$. The equation becomes $\\frac{x}{C+x} = \\frac{y}{C+y}$. This is a simple algebraic relationship. Cross-multiplying gives:\n$$ x(C + y) = y(C + x) $$\n$$ xC + xy = yC + yx $$\nThe $xy$ terms on both sides cancel, leaving:\n$$ xC = yC $$\nSince $C = 1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_{m}}$ must be a positive value (as $[S] \\ge 0$ and $K_{m} > 0$), we can divide both sides by $C$. This yields $x = y$.\nSubstituting back the original expressions for $x$ and $y$, we arrive at the general relationship between the inhibitor concentrations and their respective inhibition constants to achieve the same target occupancy:\n$$ \\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{wt}}}{K_{i,\\mathrm{wt}}} = \\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_{i,\\mathrm{mut}}} $$\nThis elegant result demonstrates that to maintain a constant level of target occupancy against enzymes with different inhibitor affinities, the ratio of the inhibitor concentration $[I]$ to its inhibition constant $K_{i}$ must be held constant. This ratio, $\\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}$, can be interpreted as a dimensionless measure of effective inhibitory pressure.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the fold-increase in dose required to maintain this occupancy when treating an infection with the mutant enzyme compared to the wild-type. The problem states that the free inhibitor concentration $[I]$ scales linearly with the administered dose. Therefore, the fold-increase in dose is equivalent to the fold-increase in concentration, which is the ratio $\\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{mut}}}{[I]_{\\mathrm{wt}}}$.\nRearranging the derived relationship gives:\n$$ \\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{mut}}}{[I]_{\\mathrm{wt}}} = \\frac{K_{i,\\mathrm{mut}}}{K_{i,\\mathrm{wt}}} $$\nWe are given the values $K_{i,\\mathrm{wt}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $K_{i,\\mathrm{mut}} = 200\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. Substituting these values:\n$$ \\text{Fold-increase} = \\frac{200\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{10\\,\\mathrm{nM}} = 20 $$\nThus, a $20$-fold increase in inhibitor concentration (and therefore dose) is required to overcome the resistance conferred by the double mutation.\n\nRegarding the pharmacological feasibility, a $20$-fold increase in the dose of a drug is exceptionally large and generally considered infeasible. Antifolate agents like pyrimethamine achieve their therapeutic effect by selectively inhibiting the parasite's DHFR over the human homolog. However, this selectivity is not absolute. A $20$-fold increase in systemic drug concentration would drastically increase the drug's effect on the human DHFR enzyme, almost certainly leading to severe dose-limiting toxicities. For antifolates, this typically manifests as bone marrow suppression (leading to megaloblastic anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia) due to the disruption of folate metabolism in rapidly dividing human cells. Such a high level of resistance would render the drug clinically ineffective because the dose required for efficacy would be toxic to the patient.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{20}\n$$", "id": "4621738"}]}
