Consider a one-compartment intravenous dosing scenario with instantaneous distribution, negligible protein binding, and negligible elimination during the brief infusion such that the end-of-infusion peak concentration is determined by mass balance. A clinician wishes to dose an aminoglycoside for an adult patient with an infection due to an aerobic Gram-negative bacillus and an isolate minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of $1.7\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,L^{-1}}$. The goal is to achieve a ratio of peak concentration to MIC, $C_{\\max}/\\mathrm{MIC}$, of at least $8$ on the first dose.

Round your final dose to three significant figures and express it in milligrams (mg).", "solution": "The validity of the problem statement has been confirmed. The premises are scientifically sound, the data are consistent and sufficient, and the question is well-posed within the domain of clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.\n\nThe solution is partitioned into two components as requested: a concise justification for the pharmacodynamic parameter of interest, followed by the derivation and calculation of the required dose.\n\nFirst, we address why the peak concentration to minimum inhibitory concentration ratio, denoted as $C_{\\max}/\\mathrm{MIC}$, is the principal driver of aminoglycoside efficacy, rather than the time the concentration remains above the MIC, denoted as $T > \\mathrm{MIC}$. This justification hinges on the specific mechanism of action and resulting pharmacodynamic properties of this class of antibiotics.\n\nThe **Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)** is defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial agent that prevents the visible in vitro growth of a microorganism. While a fundamental measure of an antibiotic's potency against a specific pathogen, the MIC itself does not describe the rate or manner of bacterial killing.\n\nAntibiotics are broadly classified by their killing kinetics. **Bacteriostatic** agents inhibit bacterial growth and replication, whereas **bactericidal** agents actively kill bacteria. Furthermore, bactericidal drugs can exhibit either **time-dependent killing** or **concentration-dependent killing**. For time-dependent agents, the killing effect saturates at concentrations just a few multiples above the MIC. Thus, the primary goal is to maintain the drug concentration above the MIC for a significant portion of the dosing interval ($T > \\mathrm{MIC}$).\n\nAminoglycosides, in contrast, are characterized by two key properties stated in the problem: they exhibit **concentration-dependent bactericidal activity** and possess a **prolonged post-antibiotic effect (PAE)**.\n1.  **Concentration-Dependent Killing**: For aminoglycosides, increasing the concentration well above the MIC leads to a more rapid and extensive rate of bacterial killing. A higher peak concentration therefore results in a more profound initial reduction in the bacterial load.\n2.  **Post-Antibiotic Effect (PAE)**: This is the persistent suppression of bacterial growth that continues even after the antibiotic concentration has fallen below the MIC. Aminoglycosides have a significant PAE, especially against Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nThe combination of these two properties makes the initial peak concentration the most critical factor for clinical success. A high $C_{\\max}$ relative to the MIC ensures a rapid and extensive bactericidal effect at the onset of therapy. The subsequent PAE then prevents bacterial regrowth during the period when drug concentrations are low or sub-therapeutic. This allows for extended-interval dosing (e.g., once daily), where a single large dose is given to maximize the peak, followed by a long drug-free period. The efficacy is driven by the magnitude of this peak ($C_{\\max}$) relative to the pathogen's susceptibility (MIC). Therefore, the pharmacodynamic index that best correlates with aminoglycoside efficacy is the $C_{\\max}/\\mathrm{MIC}$ ratio, not $T > \\mathrm{MIC}$.\n\nNext, we derive and compute the required dose. The problem specifies a one-compartment model for an intravenous administration with instantaneous distribution. Under these assumptions, the peak plasma concentration, $C_{\\max}$, immediately after the dose is given by the mass balance equation:\n$$C_{\\max} = \\frac{D}{V_d}$$\nwhere $D$ is the dose administered and $V_d$ is the apparent volume of distribution.\n\nThe clinical objective is to achieve a peak-to-MIC ratio of at least $8$:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\max}}{\\mathrm{MIC}} \\ge 8$$\nThis implies that the target peak concentration must satisfy:\n$$C_{\\max} \\ge 8 \\times \\mathrm{MIC}$$\n\nThe total volume of distribution, $V_d$, for the patient is calculated from the patient's body weight, $W$, and the specific volume of distribution, $v_d$:\n$$V_d = W \\times v_d$$\n\nWe can rearrange the mass balance equation to solve for the dose $D$:\n$$D = C_{\\max} \\times V_d$$\nTo meet the therapeutic target, the minimum required dose, $D_{\\min}$, is calculated using the minimum target $C_{\\max}$ and the patient's $V_d$:\n$$D_{\\min} = (8 \\times \\mathrm{MIC}) \\times (W \\times v_d)$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Patient weight, $W = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Specific volume of distribution, $v_d = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{L\\,kg^{-1}}$\n- Minimum Inhibitory Concentration, $\\mathrm{MIC} = 1.7\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,L^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the patient's total volume of distribution:\n$$V_d = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 0.25\\,\\mathrm{L\\,kg^{-1}} = 17.5\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\nNext, we determine the target peak concentration:\n$$C_{\\max, \\text{target}} = 8 \\times 1.7\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,L^{-1}} = 13.6\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,L^{-1}}$$\nFinally, we compute the required dose:\n$$D = C_{\\max, \\text{target}} \\times V_d = 13.6\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,L^{-1}} \\times 17.5\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\n$$D = 238\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

Second, time-kill assay data must be used to determine if the observed synergy in growth inhibition translates to enhanced bactericidal activity, explained in a mechanistic context.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (FIC) Index**\n\nThe FIC index is a quantitative measure of the interaction between two antimicrobial agents. It is the sum of the fractional inhibitory concentrations of each drug in the combination. The FIC for a single drug is the ratio of its concentration in an inhibitory combination to its Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) when used alone.\n\nThe formula for the FIC index is:\n$$ \\text{FIC index} = \\text{FIC}_A + \\text{FIC}_B $$\nwhere for drug A and drug B:\n$$ \\text{FIC}_A = \\frac{\\text{Concentration of drug A in combination that is inhibitory}}{\\text{MIC of drug A alone}} $$\n$$ \\text{FIC}_B = \\frac{\\text{Concentration of drug B in combination that is inhibitory}}{\\text{MIC of drug B alone}} $$\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- Drug A is vancomycin (Vanc).\n- Drug B is rifampin (Rif).\n- MIC of vancomycin alone, $MIC_{Vanc} = 1.0$ mg/L.\n- MIC of rifampin alone, $MIC_{Rif} = 0.50$ mg/L.\n- Inhibitory concentration of vancomycin in combination, $C_{Vanc, combo} = 0.30$ mg/L.\n- Inhibitory concentration of rifampin in combination, $C_{Rif, combo} = 0.10$ mg/L.\n\nFirst, we calculate the FIC for each drug.\nFor vancomycin:\n$$ \\text{FIC}_{Vanc} = \\frac{C_{Vanc, combo}}{MIC_{Vanc}} = \\frac{0.30 \\text{ mg/L}}{1.0 \\text{ mg/L}} = 0.30 $$\nFor rifampin:\n$$ \\text{FIC}_{Rif} = \\frac{C_{Rif, combo}}{MIC_{Rif}} = \\frac{0.10 \\text{ mg/L}}{0.50 \\text{ mg/L}} = 0.20 $$\n\nNext, we sum the individual FICs to obtain the FIC index:\n$$ \\text{FIC index} = \\text{FIC}_{Vanc} + \\text{FIC}_{Rif} = 0.30 + 0.20 = 0.50 $$\n\nThe interpretation of the FIC index is conventionally as follows:\n- Synergy: $\\text{FIC index} \\le 0.5$\n- Additive/Indifference: $0.5 < \\text{FIC index} \\le 4.0$\n- Antagonism: $\\text{FIC index} > 4.0$\n\nBased on our calculated value of $0.50$, the combination of vancomycin and rifampin demonstrates synergy in inhibiting the growth of this MRSA isolate. Rounding to three significant figures as requested, the FIC index is $0.500$.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of Bactericidal Activity from Time-Kill Data**\n\nThe second part of the problem asks whether the synergy observed in the static checkerboard assay (an inhibition-based endpoint) translates to enhanced bactericidal activity. This is assessed using the provided time-kill experiment data.\n\nThe fundamental definitions are:\n- **Bactericidal action:** A reduction in the initial bacterial inoculum by at least $3$ $\\log_{10}$ colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL), which corresponds to a $99.9\\%$ kill, over a $24$-hour period.\n- **Bacteriostatic action:** A reduction of less than $3$ $\\log_{10}$ CFU/mL over a $24$-hour period. This includes cases where the bacterial count remains stable or decreases by less than $99.9\\%$.\n\nThe initial inoculum is given as $N_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{7}$ CFU/mL. This corresponds to a starting log count of $\\log_{10}(1.0 \\times 10^{7}) = 7.0$. We will calculate the change in $\\log_{10}$ CFU/mL for each condition. The log reduction is calculated as $\\log_{10}(N_0) - \\log_{10}(N_{24})$, where $N_{24}$ is the count after $24$ hours.\n\n1.  **Vancomycin alone (at MIC of $1.0$ mg/L):**\n    The final count is $N_{Vanc} = 1.6 \\times 10^{6}$ CFU/mL.\n    The final log count is $\\log_{10}(N_{Vanc}) = \\log_{10}(1.6 \\times 10^{6}) = \\log_{10}(1.6) + 6 \\approx 6.204$.\n    The log reduction is $\\Delta_{\\log} = 7.0 - 6.204 = 0.796$.\n    Since $0.796 < 3$, vancomycin alone at its MIC is **bacteriostatic** against this isolate under these conditions.\n\n2.  **Rifampin alone (at MIC of $0.50$ mg/L):**\n    The final count is $N_{Rif} = 5.0 \\times 10^{5}$ CFU/mL.\n    The final log count is $\\log_{10}(N_{Rif}) = \\log_{10}(5.0 \\times 10^{5}) = \\log_{10}(5.0) + 5 \\approx 5.699$.\n    The log reduction is $\\Delta_{\\log} = 7.0 - 5.699 = 1.301$.\n    Since $1.301 < 3$, rifampin alone at its MIC is also **bacteriostatic**.\n\n3.  **Vancomycin-Rifampin Combination ($0.30$ mg/L and $0.10$ mg/L):**\n    The final count is $N_{combo} = 5.0 \\times 10^{3}$ CFU/mL.\n    The final log count is $\\log_{10}(N_{combo}) = \\log_{10}(5.0 \\times 10^{3}) = \\log_{10}(5.0) + 3 \\approx 3.699$.\n    The log reduction is $\\Delta_{\\log} = 7.0 - 3.699 = 3.301$.\n    Since $3.301 \\ge 3$, the combination is **bactericidal**.\n\n**Conclusion and Mechanistic Interpretation**\n\nThe analysis of the time-kill data explicitly demonstrates that the synergy observed in the checkerboard assay does indeed translate to enhanced bactericidal activity. While both vancomycin and rifampin are individually bacteriostatic at their respective MICs, their combination at sub-MIC concentrations results in a bactericidal effect. This phenomenon, where two bacteriostatic agents become bactericidal in combination, is a well-documented form of synergy.\n\nFrom a mechanistic standpoint, this can be explained by the drugs' distinct modes of action. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the D-Ala-D-Ala terminus of peptidoglycan precursors. This action primarily affects Gram-positive bacteria like *Staphylococcus aureus* and can weaken the cell envelope. Rifampin is a rifamycin that inhibits bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thereby blocking transcription and essential protein synthesis. For rifampin to be effective, it must penetrate the bacterial cell to reach its intracellular target.\n\nThe synergistic bactericidal effect likely arises because the cell wall damage caused by vancomycin facilitates increased intracellular penetration of rifampin. With greater access to RNA polymerase, rifampin can more effectively shut down the cell's transcriptional machinery. The combined assault—a compromised cell wall and a halt to vital protein production—is more catastrophic to the cell than either insult alone, leading to cell death (bactericidal action) rather than just the inhibition of growth (bacteriostatic action).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.500}$$", "id": "4629956"}]}
