This model is a standard and widely used simplification for calculating loading doses for drugs like aminoglycosides, which primarily distribute into the extracellular fluid. The provided values for volume of distribution ($0.25$ $\\text{L}/\\text{kg}$) and target concentration ($8$ $\\text{mg}/\\text{L}$) for gentamicin are clinically realistic.

The objective is clearly stated.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language common to pharmacology and medicine. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, missing information, or logical flaws. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the loading dose, $D_{L}$, that achieves a target peak concentration, $C_{\\max}$, immediately following IV administration and distribution.\n\n1.  The volume of distribution, $V_{d}$, is given as a specific volume per unit of body weight. The total volume of distribution for the patient, which we will denote as $V_{d, \\text{total}}$, is calculated by multiplying the specific volume by the patient's weight $W$.\n    $$V_{d, \\text{total}} = V_{d} \\times W$$\n\n2.  The problem provides the definition of the volume of distribution as the ratio of the amount of drug in the body, $A$, to the concentration in the plasma, $C$, at distribution equilibrium.\n    $$V_{d, \\text{total}} = \\frac{A}{C}$$\n\n3.  The clinical goal is to achieve a peak concentration $C_{\\max}$ at distribution equilibrium. At this specific point in time, the concentration $C$ is equal to $C_{\\max}$, and the amount of drug in the body is $A$. The relationship is:\n    $$C_{\\max} = \\frac{A}{V_{d, \\text{total}}}$$\n\n4.  The problem states that for an IV dose, we can assume that the amount of drug in the body, $A$, immediately after administration and distribution is approximately equal to the administered loading dose, $D_{L}$. This is a key assumption based on the idea that distribution is rapid and elimination is negligible over this short period.\n    $$A \\approx D_{L}$$\n\n5.  By substituting $D_{L}$ for $A$ in the concentration equation, we can relate the loading dose directly to the target peak concentration.\n    $$C_{\\max} \\approx \\frac{D_{L}}{V_{d, \\text{total}}}$$\n\n6.  To find the expression for the loading dose, we rearrange the equation:\n    $$D_{L} \\approx C_{\\max} \\times V_{d, \\text{total}}$$\n\n7.  Finally, substituting the expression for $V_{d, \\text{total}}$ from step 1 gives the complete derived expression for the loading dose:\n    $$D_{L} \\approx C_{\\max} \\times V_{d} \\times W$$\n\n### Statement of Assumptions\nAs required by the problem, the derivation relies on the following key pharmacokinetic assumptions:\n1.  **Single-Compartment Model**: The drug is assumed to distribute instantaneously and uniformly throughout a single, well-mixed volume (the volume of distribution). This implies that the drug concentration is the same throughout this conceptual compartment once distribution is complete.\n2.  **Negligible Elimination During Distribution**: It is assumed that no significant amount of the drug is eliminated (by metabolism or excretion) from the body during the administration and immediate post-administration distribution phase. This allows the amount of drug in the body at peak concentration to be equated to the total dose administered. This assumption is most valid for a rapid IV bolus injection.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nThe derived expression is now used to compute the numerical value of the loading dose using the given parameters.\n\n-   $C_{\\max} = 8$ $\\text{mg}/\\text{L}$\n-   $V_{d} = 0.25$ $\\text{L}/\\text{kg}$\n-   $W = 70$ $\\text{kg}$\n\n$$D_{L} = (8 \\text{ mg}/\\text{L}) \\times (0.25 \\text{ L}/\\text{kg}) \\times (70 \\text{ kg})$$\nThe units are consistent: $(\\text{mg}/\\text{L}) \\times (\\text{L}/\\text{kg}) \\times \\text{kg} = \\text{mg}$.\n\n$$D_{L} = (8 \\times 0.25 \\times 70) \\text{ mg}$$\n$$D_{L} = (2 \\times 70) \\text{ mg}$$\n$$D_{L} = 140 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact calculated value is $140$. To express this value unambiguously with three significant figures, it is written in scientific notation as $1.40 \\times 10^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.40 \\times 10^{2}}$$", "id": "4620861"}, {"introduction": "Once a therapeutic level is achieved, the focus shifts to maintaining it, which requires understanding how the body eliminates the drug. For aminoglycosides, elimination is almost entirely dependent on renal function, making it a critical factor in preventing toxicity.

The problem is well-posed, as all necessary data and relationships are provided to calculate a unique solution. The language is objective and quantitative. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. We will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Half-Life Expression\n\nWe begin with the governing differential equation for first-order elimination:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = -k\\,A(t) $$\nThis is a separable first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables and integrating:\n$$ \\int_{A(0)}^{A(t)} \\frac{dA}{A} = \\int_{0}^{t} -k\\,dt' $$\n$$ \\ln(A(t)) - \\ln(A(0)) = -kt $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{A(t)}{A(0)}\\right) = -kt $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the solution for $A(t)$:\n$$ A(t) = A(0) \\exp(-kt) $$\nBy definition, the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is the time it takes for the amount of drug to be reduced to half of its initial value, $A(0)$. We set $t = t_{1/2}$ and $A(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{A(0)}{2}$:\n$$ \\frac{A(0)}{2} = A(0) \\exp(-k t_{1/2}) $$\nDividing by $A(0)$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2}) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2} $$\n$$ -\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2} $$\nSolving for $t_{1/2}$, we obtain the standard expression for first-order half-life:\n$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k} $$\nThe problem provides the pharmacokinetic identity $CL = k\\,V_{d}$. We can rearrange this to express the elimination rate constant $k$ in terms of clearance $CL$ and volume of distribution $V_{d}$:\n$$ k = \\frac{CL}{V_{d}} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $k$ into our equation for $t_{1/2}$ yields the desired expression in terms of the clinically relevant parameters $CL$ and $V_{d}$:\n$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{CL/V_{d}} = \\frac{V_{d} \\ln(2)}{CL} $$\n\n### Numerical Computation for the Patient\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $t_{1/2}$ for the given patient.\n\nFirst, we calculate the patient's total volume of distribution, $V_{d, \\text{total}}$. The problem states the volume of distribution per unit mass is $0.25$ $\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{kg}$ and the patient's mass is $60$ $\\mathrm{kg}$.\n$$ V_{d, \\text{total}} = (0.25 \\, \\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{kg}) \\times (60 \\, \\mathrm{kg}) = 15 \\, \\mathrm{L} $$\n\nSecond, we calculate the patient's gentamicin systemic clearance, $CL$, using the clinical approximation $CL \\approx f \\cdot CL_{\\text{Cr}}$. The given values are $f = 0.8$ and $CL_{\\text{Cr}} = 40$ $\\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{min}$.\n$$ CL = f \\cdot CL_{\\text{Cr}} = 0.8 \\times 40 \\, \\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{min} = 32 \\, \\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{min} $$\n\nThe final answer for $t_{1/2}$ is required in hours. We must ensure consistent units before performing the final calculation. The volume of distribution is in liters ($L$), and the clearance is in milliliters per minute ($\\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{min}$). We will convert the clearance to liters per hour ($\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{hr}$).\n$$ 1 \\, \\mathrm{L} = 1000 \\, \\mathrm{mL} $$\n$$ 1 \\, \\mathrm{hr} = 60 \\, \\mathrm{min} $$\nSo, we convert $CL$:\n$$ CL = 32 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{min}} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\mathrm{L}}{1000 \\, \\mathrm{mL}} \\times \\frac{60 \\, \\mathrm{min}}{1 \\, \\mathrm{hr}} = \\frac{32 \\times 60}{1000} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{hr}} = 1.92 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{hr}} $$\n\nNow we have $V_{d, \\text{total}} = 15$ $\\mathrm{L}$ and $CL = 1.92$ $\\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{hr}$. We can substitute these values into our derived expression for $t_{1/2}$:\n$$ t_{1/2} = \\frac{V_{d, \\text{total}} \\ln(2)}{CL} = \\frac{15 \\, \\mathrm{L} \\times \\ln(2)}{1.92 \\, \\mathrm{L}/\\mathrm{hr}} $$\nThe units $\\mathrm{L}$ cancel, leaving hours, as required.

The predicted pre-dose trough concentration, $C'_{\\text{trough}}$, is the concentration at time $t = \\tau - T_{\\text{inf}}$ after the end of the infusion, where $\\tau = 24$ hours is the dosing interval.\n$$\nC'_{\\text{trough}} = C'_{\\text{0,end}} \\exp(-k (\\tau - T_{\\text{inf}}))\n$$\n$$\nC'_{\\text{trough}} = 18.0554 \\times \\exp(-0.2417206 \\times (24 - 0.5)) = 18.0554 \\times \\exp(-0.2417206 \\times 23.5)\n$$\n$$\nC'_{\\text{trough}} = 18.0554 \\times \\exp(-5.6804) \\approx 18.0554 \\times 0.00341 \\approx 0.0616 \\, \\mathrm{mg/L}\n$$\nThe maximum acceptable trough concentration is $C_{\\text{trough,max}} = 0.5$ mg/L. Since our predicted trough $C'_{\\text{trough}} \\approx 0.0616$ mg/L is less than $0.5$ mg/L, the trough constraint is satisfied. The calculated dose of $345$ mg is therefore appropriate to meet the specified peak target while respecting the trough limit.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{345}$$", "id": "4620901"}]}
