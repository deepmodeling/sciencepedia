It provides a complete set of fundamental principles and numerical values required for a unique solution. The scenario is based on standard, accepted models in clinical pharmacokinetics. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the foundational principles provided.\n\nFirst, we apply the principle of conservation of mass. This principle states that the total amount of drug that is absorbed into the systemic circulation must equal the total amount of drug that is eliminated from the body over an infinite time horizon.\n\nFor an orally administered dose, the amount of drug that reaches the systemic circulation, denoted as $A_{sys}$, is the product of the administered dose, $\\mathrm{Dose}$, and the oral bioavailability, $F$. The bioavailability $F$ represents the fraction of the drug that is absorbed and bypasses first-pass metabolism to enter the systemic circulation.\n$$A_{sys} = F \\cdot \\mathrm{Dose}$$\n\nNext, we formulate an expression for the total amount of drug eliminated from the body, denoted as $A_{elim}$. The instantaneous rate of elimination at any time $t$ is given by the definition of clearance, $CL$, as the product of the clearance and the plasma concentration at that time, $C(t)$.\n$$\\text{Rate of elimination}(t) = CL \\cdot C(t)$$\nTo find the total amount of drug eliminated over an infinite time period, we must integrate this rate from time $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$.\n$$A_{elim} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (\\text{Rate of elimination}(t))\\,dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} CL \\cdot C(t)\\,dt$$\nThe problem specifies that the pharmacokinetics are linear, which implies that the clearance, $CL$, is a constant that does not change with concentration or time. Therefore, we can move $CL$ outside the integral.\n$$A_{elim} = CL \\cdot \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t)\\,dt$$\nThe problem provides the definition for the Area Under the plasma concentration-time Curve from time zero to infinity, $AUC$.\n$$AUC = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t)\\,dt$$\nSubstituting this definition into the expression for the total amount eliminated, we get:\n$$A_{elim} = CL \\cdot AUC$$\n\nNow, we apply the conservation of mass by equating the amount absorbed into the systemic circulation, $A_{sys}$, with the total amount eliminated, $A_{elim}$.\n$$A_{sys} = A_{elim}$$\n$$F \\cdot \\mathrm{Dose} = CL \\cdot AUC$$\nThis equation establishes the fundamental relationship between dose, bioavailability, clearance, and drug exposure (AUC). To find the expression for the oral AUC, we rearrange this equation algebraically.\n$$AUC = \\frac{F \\cdot \\mathrm{Dose}}{CL}$$\nThis completes the derivation of the required expression.\n\nNow, we proceed to compute the numerical value for the AUC using the provided data for ciprofloxacin:\n- Administered dose, $\\mathrm{Dose} = 500\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n- Oral bioavailability, $F = 0.7$ (dimensionless)\n- Clearance, $CL = 20\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$AUC = \\frac{0.7 \\cdot 500\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{20\\,\\mathrm{L/h}}$$\nFirst, calculate the numerator, which represents the total amount of drug entering the systemic circulation:\n$$F \\cdot \\mathrm{Dose} = 0.7 \\cdot 500\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 350\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nNow, divide this amount by the clearance to find the AUC:\n$$AUC = \\frac{350\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{20\\,\\mathrm{L/h}} = 17.5\\,\\mathrm{mg\\cdot h/L}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
