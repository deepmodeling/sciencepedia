The number of mutants that successfully establish, $N_{est}$, also follows a Poisson distribution with a new mean, $\\lambda_{est}$:\n$$\\lambda_{est} = \\lambda \\times P_{est} = (u B_0 f) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{\\delta}{\\beta}\\right)$$\nThe probability that at least one resistant lineage establishes is $P(N_{est} \\geq 1)$. This is complementary to the probability that no lineages establish, $P(N_{est} = 0)$. For a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda_{est}$, this is:\n$$P(N_{est} = 0) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_{est}) (\\lambda_{est})^{0}}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda_{est})$$\nTherefore, the total probability of at least one resistant lineage arising and establishing, $P_{total}$, is:\n$$P_{total} = 1 - P(N_{est} = 0) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{est})$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\lambda_{est}$ gives the general formula:\n$$P_{total} = 1 - \\exp\\left(-u B_0 f \\left(1 - \\frac{\\delta}{\\beta}\\right)\\right)$$\nThis formula is valid for $\\beta  \\delta$; otherwise, $P_{total} = 0$.\n\nNow, we apply this framework to the two specified scenarios.\n\n**Scenario 1: Atovaquone Monotherapy**\nThe parameters are:\n$u = 1.0 \\times 10^{-10}$\n$B_0 = 5 \\times 10^{10}$\n$f = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}$\n$\\beta = \\beta_R = 4.5 \\times 10^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{day}^{-1}$\n$\\delta = 3.5 \\times 10^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{day}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the mean number of mutants generated, $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = u B_0 f = (1.0 \\times 10^{-10}) (5 \\times 10^{10}) (2.0 \\times 10^{-2}) = 10 \\times 10^{-2} = 0.1$$\nNext, we check the condition for establishment: $\\beta_R  \\delta$.\n$4.5 \\times 10^{-1}  3.5 \\times 10^{-1}$, which is true.\nThe establishment probability for a single resistant lineage is:\n$$P_{est, mono} = 1 - \\frac{\\delta}{\\beta_R} = 1 - \\frac{3.5 \\times 10^{-1}}{4.5 \\times 10^{-1}} = 1 - \\frac{7}{9} = \\frac{2}{9}$$\nThe mean number of established lineages is:\n$$\\lambda_{est, mono} = \\lambda \\times P_{est, mono} = 0.1 \\times \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{2}{9} = \\frac{1}{45}$$\nThe probability of at least one establishment is:\n$$P_{total, mono} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{est, mono}) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{45}\\right)$$\nNumerically, this is $1 - \\exp(-0.0222...) \\approx 1 - 0.9780219... \\approx 0.021978...$.\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $0.0220$.\n\n**Scenario 2: Atovaquone–Proguanil Combination**\nThe combination therapy reduces the resistant clone's birth rate by a factor $\\sigma = 9.0 \\times 10^{-1}$. The new birth rate, $\\beta_{R, combo}$, is:\n$$\\beta_{R, combo} = \\beta_R \\times \\sigma = (4.5 \\times 10^{-1}) \\times (9.0 \\times 10^{-1}) = 4.05 \\times 10^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{day}^{-1}$$\nAll other relevant parameters ($\\lambda$, $\\delta$) are unchanged.\nFirst, we check the condition for establishment: $\\beta_{R, combo}  \\delta$.\n$4.05 \\times 10^{-1}  3.5 \\times 10^{-1}$, which is true.\nThe establishment probability under combination therapy is:\n$$P_{est, combo} = 1 - \\frac{\\delta}{\\beta_{R, combo}} = 1 - \\frac{3.5 \\times 10^{-1}}{4.05 \\times 10^{-1}} = 1 - \\frac{350}{405} = 1 - \\frac{70}{81} = \\frac{11}{81}$$\nThe mean number of established lineages is:\n$$\\lambda_{est, combo} = \\lambda \\times P_{est, combo} = 0.1 \\times \\frac{11}{81} = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{11}{81} = \\frac{11}{810}$$\nThe probability of at least one establishment is:\n$$P_{total, combo} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{est, combo}) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{11}{810}\\right)$$\nNumerically, this is $1 - \\exp(-0.01358...) \\approx 1 - 0.986519... \\approx 0.013480...$.\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $0.0135$.\n\nThe two probabilities are approximately $0.0220$ for monotherapy and $0.0135$ for combination therapy.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.0220  0.0135\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4622770"}]}
