It provides a standard pharmacokinetic calculation scenario with all necessary, consistent, and realistic data.\n\nThe central principle for solving this problem is the definition of the apparent volume of distribution, denoted as $V_d$. In a one-compartment model where the drug is assumed to distribute instantaneously and homogeneously, $V_d$ is a proportionality constant that relates the total amount of drug in the body, $A$, to the drug's concentration in plasma, $C_p$. The relationship is defined as:\n$$ V_d = \\frac{A}{C_p} $$\nFrom this fundamental equation, we can determine the amount of drug that must be administered to achieve a desired plasma concentration. The problem asks for the \"total loading amount\", which we will denote as $A_L$. This is the initial dose required to promptly achieve the \"target initial plasma concentration\", which we denote as $C_{p, \\text{target}}$.

It presents a standard clinical scenario for therapeutic drug monitoring and dose adjustment.\n\nThe solution to this problem is based on the principle of linear pharmacokinetics, which is explicitly stated as an assumption. Under linear kinetics, at a constant dosing interval ($\\tau$), the steady-state plasma concentration of a drug is directly proportional to the dosing rate. The dosing rate is the dose ($D$) divided by the dosing interval ($\\tau$).

We convert hours to days by dividing by $24\\,\\text{h}\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$:\n$$t_{95\\%} (\\text{days}) = \\frac{157.276\\,\\text{h}}{24\\,\\text{h}\\,\\text{day}^{-1}} \\approx 6.553\\,\\text{days}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $6.55\\,\\text{days}$.\n\n**Monitoring Plan Justification**\nTacrolimus has a narrow therapeutic index, meaning the difference between effective and toxic concentrations is small. The interaction with voriconazole is clinically significant because it drastically reduces tacrolimus clearance, prolonging its half-life from approximately $18.2\\,\\text{h}$ ($t_{1/2,0} = \\ln(2) \\cdot 105 / 4.0$) to $36.4\\,\\text{h}$ ($t_{1/2,1}$). Without a dose reduction, tacrolimus would accumulate to toxic levels. By reducing the dose to $3\\,\\text{mg}\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$, the new target steady state is designed to be the same as the pre-voriconazole state. A trough level measurement is used to assess if the target is achieved. Obtaining this level requires waiting for the new steady state to be established. The calculation shows that it takes approximately $6.55$ days to reach $95\\%$ of this new equilibrium. Therefore, a trough level should be measured at the earliest on day $7$ after initiating voriconazole and the new tacrolimus dose. Measuring earlier would reflect a concentration that is still rising and not representative of the new steady state, potentially leading to an erroneous and dangerous clinical decision (e.g., a premature dose increase).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3.00 & 6.55 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4682309"}]}
