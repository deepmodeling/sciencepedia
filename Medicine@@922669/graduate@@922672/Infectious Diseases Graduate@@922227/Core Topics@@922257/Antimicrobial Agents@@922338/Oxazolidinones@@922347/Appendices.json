All necessary data and assumptions are provided to solve for the absolute oral bioavailability of linezolid and to make a qualitative inference regarding clinical interchangeability. The problem is based on fundamental principles of pharmacokinetics.\n\nThe absolute oral bioavailability, $F$, is defined as the fraction of an orally administered dose that reaches the systemic circulation unchanged, compared to a reference intravenous dose. It is calculated by comparing the dose-normalized area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for the oral route to that for the intravenous route.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between systemic drug exposure (AUC), the systemically available dose, and clearance ($CL$) is given by:\n$$\nAUC = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_{\\text{systemic}}}{CL}\n$$\nFor a given drug, assuming its clearance is independent of the route of administration (a key assumption provided), we can write separate equations for the intravenous (IV) and oral (per os, PO) routes.\n\nFor the intravenous route, the bioavailability is complete by definition, so $F_{\\mathrm{iv}} = 1$. The entire dose $D_{\\mathrm{iv}}$ reaches the systemic circulation.\n$$\nAUC_{\\mathrm{iv}} = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{iv}} \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{iv}}}{CL} = \\frac{1 \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{iv}}}{CL}\n$$\n\nFor the oral route, only a fraction $F$ of the dose $D_{\\mathrm{po}}$ reaches the systemic circulation.\n$$\nAUC_{\\mathrm{po}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{po}}}{CL}\n$$\n\nTo find $F$, we can form a ratio of the two equations, which has the advantage of eliminating the clearance term, $CL$:\n$$\n\\frac{AUC_{\\mathrm{po}}}{AUC_{\\mathrm{iv}}} = \\frac{\\frac{F \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{po}}}{CL}}{\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{iv}}}{CL}}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling the common $CL$ term yields:\n$$\n\\frac{AUC_{\\mathrm{po}}}{AUC_{\\mathrm{iv}}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{po}}}{D_{\\mathrm{iv}}}\n$$\nWe can now rearrange this equation to solve for the absolute bioavailability, $F$:\n$$\nF = \\frac{AUC_{\\mathrm{po}}}{AUC_{\\mathrm{iv}}} \\cdot \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{iv}}}{D_{\\mathrm{po}}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\nOral dose, $D_{\\mathrm{po}} = 600\\,\\text{mg}$\nIntravenous dose, $D_{\\mathrm{iv}} = 600\\,\\text{mg}$\nAUC for oral administration, $AUC_{\\mathrm{po}} = 120\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{h}/\\text{L}$\nAUC for intravenous administration, $AUC_{\\mathrm{iv}} = 130\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{h}/\\text{L}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $F$:\n$$\nF = \\frac{120\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{h}/\\text{L}}{130\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{h}/\\text{L}} \\cdot \\frac{600\\,\\text{mg}}{600\\,\\text{mg}}\n$$\nSince the oral and intravenous doses are equal ($D_{\\mathrm{po}} = D_{\\mathrm{iv}}$), the dose ratio $\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{iv}}}{D_{\\mathrm{po}}}$ is equal to $1$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\nF = \\frac{120}{130} = \\frac{12}{13}\n$$\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$$\nF \\approx 0.9230769...\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nF \\approx 0.923\n$$\nThis means that approximately $92.3\\%$ of the orally administered linezolid dose reaches the systemic circulation.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks to infer whether the oral and intravenous routes are clinically interchangeable for achieving comparable exposure. The calculated absolute bioavailability of $F \\approx 0.923$ is very high. A bioavailability value close to $1$ indicates that the oral route is nearly as efficient as the intravenous route at delivering the drug to the bloodstream. The ratio of exposures for the same dose ($600\\,\\text{mg}$) is directly given by the ratio of the AUCs, which is $\\frac{AUC_{\\mathrm{po}}}{AUC_{\\mathrm{iv}}} = \\frac{120}{130} \\approx 0.923$. This ratio falls squarely within the conventional bioequivalence interval of $0.80$ to $1.25$ used by regulatory agencies for determining if two formulations provide comparable systemic exposure. Although this problem does not provide the statistical data (e.g., confidence intervals) required for a formal bioequivalence assessment, the point estimate of the exposure ratio is very close to $1.0$. Therefore, based on the high bioavailability and the resulting comparable drug exposure, it is reasonable to conclude that the oral and intravenous routes are clinically interchangeable. This property allows for a straightforward \"IV-to-PO switch\" in clinical practice, often without needing to adjust the dose, which is a significant advantage for patient care and healthcare economics.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.923}\n$$", "id": "4960682"}, {"introduction": "Effective antibiotic therapy aims not only to treat the current infection but also to prevent the emergence of resistance. The Mutant Selection Window (MSW) hypothesis provides a powerful framework for this, defining the drug concentration range where resistant mutants are most likely to be enriched. By calculating the width of this window from the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Mutant Prevention Concentration (MPC), we can begin to reason about dosing regimens that suppress both susceptible bacteria and emerging resistant subpopulations [@problem_id:4960647].", "problem": "A patient is being treated with the oxazolidinone antibiotic linezolid for a serious Gram-positive infection.

The mutant selection window (MSW) is the concentration interval in which the antibiotic suppresses susceptible bacteria but permits enrichment of less susceptible mutants; it is bounded below by the MIC and above by the MPC.

No numerical pharmacokinetic parameters are required for the justification. \n\nProvide the final fold-width as a single number without units. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem has two parts: a quantitative calculation and a qualitative justification of a dosing strategy.\n\n**Part 1: Computation of the Fold-Width**\n\nThe problem defines the Mutant Selection Window (MSW) as the concentration interval bounded below by the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration ($\\text{MIC}$) and above by the Mutant Prevention Concentration ($\\text{MPC}$).\nThe lower boundary of the window is $\\text{MIC} = 1\\,\\text{mg/L}$.\nThe upper boundary of the window is $\\text{MPC} = 4\\,\\text{mg/L}$.\n\nThe dimensionless fold-width is defined as the factor by which the upper boundary exceeds the lower boundary.

The $\\text{MSW}$ is the concentration range, $[\\text{MIC}, \\text{MPC}]$, where susceptible bacteria are inhibited but pre-existing, less-susceptible mutants can selectively amplify.\n\nLet $C(t)$ be the time-varying concentration of the antibiotic in the patient. The goal is to design a dosing regimen (dose size and dosing interval) that minimizes the total time spent in the state $\\text{MIC} \\le C(t) \\le \\text{MPC}$ over the course of therapy.\n\nFrom first principles, there are three primary concentration ranges relative to the pathogen:\n1.  $C(t) < \\text{MIC}$: The concentration is sub-therapeutic. Both susceptible and resistant bacteria can grow. There is no effective antimicrobial pressure. This range must be avoided to ensure efficacy.\n2.  $\\text{MIC} \\le C(t) \\le \\text{MPC}$: This is the $\\text{MSW}$. The concentration is sufficient to kill or inhibit the bulk susceptible population but insufficient to inhibit the growth of less-susceptible, first-step resistant mutants. This is the danger zone for the selection of resistance.\n3.  $C(t) > \\text{MPC}$: The concentration is high enough to inhibit both the susceptible population and the least-susceptible, first-step resistant mutants. This is the resistance-suppressive range.\n\nTo maintain efficacy, the concentration $C(t)$ must be kept above the $\\text{MIC}$ for a sufficient duration. To minimize resistance selection, the time $C(t)$ spends in the $\\text{MSW}$ must be minimized. The only logical strategy that satisfies both conditions is to maintain the drug concentration in the range $C(t) > \\text{MPC}$ for the longest possible duration of the dosing interval.\n\nIn a typical pharmacokinetic profile, the drug concentration oscillates between a peak ($C_{max}$) and a trough ($C_{min}$). The ideal dosing strategy would be to ensure that the trough concentration remains above the $\\text{MPC}$:\n$$C_{min} > \\text{MPC}$$\nIf this condition is met, then $C(t)$ is always greater than the $\\text{MPC}$ for the entire dosing interval, meaning the time spent within the $\\text{MSW}$ is zero. This is the most robust strategy for preventing resistance.\n\nThis is achieved through aggressive dosing regimens, such as using sufficiently high doses and/or appropriate dosing frequencies (e.g., more frequent administration) to raise the $C_{min}$ above the $\\text{MPC}$ threshold. The primary constraint on this strategy is safety; the peak concentration, $C_{max}$, must remain below levels associated with toxicity. Therefore, the optimal dosing strategy seeks to maintain the antibiotic concentration profile entirely above the $\\text{MPC}$ but below the toxic threshold. This maximizes efficacy, prevents the selection of resistance, and maintains patient safety.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "4960647"}, {"introduction": "Beyond efficacy, ensuring patient safety is paramount, which requires a deep understanding of potential drug-drug interactions. Oxazolidinones are known for their reversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO), creating a risk for serotonin syndrome when co-administered with other serotonergic agents.

At therapeutic unbound concentrations, the ratio of inhibitor concentration to inhibition constant for monoamine oxidase A is much smaller for tedizolid than for linezolid, leading to negligible reversible monoamine oxidase A occupancy and inhibition by tedizolid compared with linezolid; this accounts for the lower serotonergic interaction risk despite both being oxazolidinones.\n\nB. Tedizolid’s lower serotonergic risk is due to selective, irreversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase B with sparing of monoamine oxidase A, preventing serotonin accumulation even at therapeutic concentrations.\n\nC.

All necessary data and principles for a quantitative analysis are provided, and the premises are consistent with established pharmacological principles. The problem is valid.\n\nThe central task is to explain the difference in serotonergic interaction risk between linezolid and tedizolid by reasoning from the principles of reversible enzyme inhibition, using the provided in vitro inhibition constants ($K_i$) and in vivo therapeutic unbound plasma concentrations ($C_{u,ss}$). The primary concern is the inhibition of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), as it is the main enzyme responsible for metabolizing serotonin.\n\nLet $E$ represent the enzyme MAO-A, $I$ represent the inhibitor drug (linezolid or tedizolid), and $EI$ represent the enzyme-inhibitor complex. The reversible binding process is described by the equilibrium:\n$$ E + I \\rightleftharpoons EI $$\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the dissociation constant, $K_i$, is defined as:\n$$ K_i = \\frac{[E][I]}{[EI]} $$\nwhere $[E]$ is the concentration of free enzyme, $[I]$ is the concentration of the free inhibitor, and $[EI]$ is the concentration of the enzyme-inhibitor complex.\n\nThe degree of enzyme inhibition, and thus the risk of a pharmacodynamic interaction like serotonin syndrome, is determined by the fraction of the total enzyme population that is occupied by the inhibitor. This is the fractional occupancy, denoted by $\\theta$. The total enzyme concentration, $[E]_T$, is the sum of free and bound enzyme:\n$$ [E]_T = [E] + [EI] $$\nThe fractional occupancy is the ratio of the concentration of the enzyme-inhibitor complex to the total enzyme concentration:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[EI]}{[E]_T} = \\frac{[EI]}{[E] + [EI]} $$\n\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of measurable quantities, we first rearrange the definition of $K_i$ to solve for $[E]$:\n$$ [E] = \\frac{K_i [EI]}{[I]} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $[E]$ into the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[EI]}{\\frac{K_i [EI]}{[I]} + [EI]} $$\nBy factoring out $[EI]$ from the denominator, we get:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[EI]}{[EI] \\left( \\frac{K_i}{[I]} + 1 \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_i}{[I]} + 1} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[I]$ yields the final expression for fractional occupancy:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[I]}{K_i + [I]} $$\n\nIn a clinical context, the effective concentration of the inhibitor, $[I]$, is the average steady-state unbound plasma concentration, $C_{u,ss}$. Therefore, the fractional occupancy of MAO-A at therapeutic drug levels is:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{C_{u,ss}}{K_i^A + C_{u,ss}} $$\nwhere $K_i^A$ is the inhibition constant for MAO-A. This equation demonstrates that the fractional occupancy is governed by the ratio of the unbound drug concentration to the inhibition constant.\n\nNow, we can calculate the fractional occupancy for both drugs using the provided data.\n\nFor linezolid:\n- $C_{u,ss} \\approx 10 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_i^A = 35 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$\n\nThe ratio of concentration to inhibition constant is $\\frac{C_{u,ss}}{K_i^A} = \\frac{10}{35} \\approx 0.286$.\nThe fractional occupancy of MAO-A by linezolid is:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{linezolid}} = \\frac{10 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}}{35 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M} + 10 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{10}{45} \\approx 0.222 $$\nThis means that at therapeutic concentrations, approximately $22.2\\%$ of MAO-A enzymes are occupied by linezolid. This is a substantial level of enzyme inhibition, sufficient to precipitate a clinically significant drug interaction.\n\nFor tedizolid:\n- $C_{u,ss} \\approx 1 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_i^A = 350 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$\n\nThe ratio of concentration to inhibition constant is $\\frac{C_{u,ss}}{K_i^A} = \\frac{1}{350} \\approx 0.00286$.\nThe fractional occupancy of MAO-A by tedizolid is:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{tedizolid}} = \\frac{1 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}}{350 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M} + 1 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{1}{351} \\approx 0.00285 $$\nAt therapeutic concentrations, only about $0.285\\%$ of MAO-A enzymes are occupied by tedizolid. This level of occupancy is negligible and is very unlikely to cause a clinically significant reduction in serotonin metabolism.\n\nThe comparison clearly shows that the combination of a lower therapeutic unbound concentration ($10$-fold lower) and weaker affinity for MAO-A (a $10$-fold higher $K_i$) results in a dramatically lower fractional occupancy for tedizolid compared to linezolid ($\\approx 0.3\\%$ vs. $\\approx 22\\%$). The key determining factor is the ratio $\\frac{C_{u,ss}}{K_i^A}$, which is approximately $100$ times smaller for tedizolid than for linezolid ($0.00286$ vs. $0.286$).\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. At therapeutic unbound concentrations, the ratio of inhibitor concentration to inhibition constant for monoamine oxidase A is much smaller for tedizolid than for linezolid, leading to negligible reversible monoamine oxidase A occupancy and inhibition by tedizolid compared with linezolid; this accounts for the lower serotonergic interaction risk despite both being oxazolidinones.\nThis statement is a perfect summary of the derivation above. It correctly identifies the critical parameter as the ratio of concentration to inhibition constant ($\\frac{C_{u,ss}}{K_i^A}$), correctly states that this ratio is much smaller for tedizolid, and correctly links this to negligible MAO-A occupancy and thus a lower risk of serotonin syndrome.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Tedizolid’s lower serotonergic risk is due to selective, irreversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase B with sparing of monoamine oxidase A, preventing serotonin accumulation even at therapeutic concentrations.\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, the problem states the inhibition is reversible, not irreversible. Second, the primary target for serotonin metabolism is MAO-A, so sparing MAO-A is what reduces risk, not inhibiting MAO-B. Third, the data shows tedizolid is not selective for MAO-B; its affinity for MAO-A ($K_i^A=350 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$) is approximately $3$-fold stronger than its affinity for MAO-B ($K_i^B=1000 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$).\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Tedizolid reduces serotonergic interaction risk primarily by stronger inhibition of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the gastrointestinal tract, which decreases the absorption of concomitant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and thereby prevents serotonin syndrome.\nThis option introduces a mechanism (P-gp inhibition) that is not supported by or derivable from the information provided in the problem statement. The question explicitly asks for reasoning based on the given $K_i$ and $C_{u,ss}$ data for MAO inhibition. Proposing an unrelated pharmacokinetic interaction mechanism contradicts the premise of the question.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Tedizolid’s antibacterial mechanism targets the mitochondrial ribosome more strongly than linezolid, reducing monoamine oxidase synthesis and therefore lowering the potential for serotonergic interactions in vivo.\nThis option incorrectly conflates two distinct mechanisms. The risk of acute serotonin syndrome is due to the direct, reversible inhibition of existing MAO-A enzyme activity, which is a rapid pharmacodynamic effect. The potential effect on mitochondrial ribosome protein synthesis is a chronic toxicity mechanism that would affect the *synthesis* of new enzyme over a longer period, not the activity of existing enzyme relevant to acute drug interactions. The premise of the question is about reversible binding, not changes in enzyme concentration.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4960642"}]}
