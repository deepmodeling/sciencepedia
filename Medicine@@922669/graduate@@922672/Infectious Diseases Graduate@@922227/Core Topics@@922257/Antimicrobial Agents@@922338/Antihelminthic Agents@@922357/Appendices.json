The governing equation, $dC/dt = -k\\,C$, is the correct mathematical representation for such a process. The definition of half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is also standard.

The problem is self-contained, well-posed, and scientifically grounded. Therefore, it is deemed valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe first objective is to derive the functional form of the plasma concentration, $C(t)$, from the given ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = -k\\,C\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients.

The half-life is defined as the time at which the concentration drops to half of its initial value, i.e., $C(t_{1/2}) = C_{0}/2$.

The activation functions with $n=1$ are:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{cat}}([{\\mathrm{Pyr}}]) = g_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{\\max} \\frac{[{\\mathrm{Pyr}}]}{EC_{50,{\\mathrm{Pyr}}} + [{\\mathrm{Pyr}}]} = 4 \\frac{[{\\mathrm{Pyr}}]}{1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + [{\\mathrm{Pyr}}]}$$\n$$g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}([{\\mathrm{Pip}}]) = g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^{\\max} \\frac{[{\\mathrm{Pip}}]}{EC_{50,{\\mathrm{Pip}}} + [{\\mathrm{Pip}}]} = 6 \\frac{[{\\mathrm{Pip}}]}{10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + [{\\mathrm{Pip}}]}$$\nThe leak conductance is constant: $g_{\\mathrm{leak}} = 1$.\n\n**Condition 1: Pyrantel alone** ($[{\\mathrm{Pyr}}] = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $[{\\mathrm{Pip}}] = 0$)\n*   $g_{\\mathrm{cat}} = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{1 + 1} = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 2$\n*   $g_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = 6 \\times \\frac{0}{10 + 0} = 0$\n*   $g_{\\mathrm{leak}} = 1$\nNow, we calculate $V_m$ for this condition, which we denote $V_{m, \\mathrm{Pyr}}$:\n$$V_{m, \\mathrm{Pyr}} = \\frac{(2)(0\\,\\mathrm{mV}) + (0)(-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}) + (1)(-60\\,\\mathrm{mV})}{2 + 0 + 1} = \\frac{-60\\,\\mathrm{mV}}{3} = -20\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nSince $V_{m, \\mathrm{Pyr}} = -20\\,\\mathrm{mV} \\ge -40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, pyrantel alone causes **spastic paralysis**.\n\n**Condition 2: Piperazine alone** ($[{\\mathrm{Pyr}}] = 0$, $[{\\mathrm{Pip}}] = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$)\n*   $g_{\\mathrm{cat}} = 4 \\times \\frac{0}{1 + 0} = 0$\n*   $g_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = 6 \\times \\frac{10}{10 + 10} = 6 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 3$\n*   $g_{\\mathrm{leak}} = 1$\nNow, we calculate $V_m$ for this condition, which we denote $V_{m, \\mathrm{Pip}}$:\n$$V_{m, \\mathrm{Pip}} = \\frac{(0)(0\\,\\mathrm{mV}) + (3)(-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}) + (1)(-60\\,\\mathrm{mV})}{0 + 3 + 1} = \\frac{-210\\,\\mathrm{mV} - 60\\,\\mathrm{mV}}{4} = \\frac{-270\\,\\mathrm{mV}}{4} = -67.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nSince $V_{m, \\mathrm{Pip}} = -67.5\\,\\mathrm{mV} \\le -62\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, piperazine alone causes **flaccid paralysis**.\n\n**Condition 3: Coadministration** ($[{\\mathrm{Pyr}}] = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $[{\\mathrm{Pip}}] = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$)\n*   $g_{\\mathrm{cat}} = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{1 + 1} = 2$\n*   $g_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = 6 \\times \\frac{10}{10 + 10} = 3$\n*   $g_{\\mathrm{leak}} = 1$\nNow, we calculate $V_m$ for coadministration, denoted $V_{m, \\mathrm{Co}}$:\n$$V_{m, \\mathrm{Co}} = \\frac{(2)(0\\,\\mathrm{mV}) + (3)(-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}) + (1)(-60\\,\\mathrm{mV})}{2 + 3 + 1} = \\frac{-210\\,\\mathrm{mV} - 60\\,\\mathrm{mV}}{6} = \\frac{-270\\,\\mathrm{mV}}{6} = -45\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nFor coadministration, the resulting membrane potential is $V_{m, \\mathrm{Co}} = -45\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Comparing this to the thresholds:\n*   $V_{m, \\mathrm{Co}} = -45\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is not $\\ge -40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, so it does not cause spastic paralysis.\n*   $V_{m, \\mathrm{Co}} = -45\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is not $\\le -62\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, so it does not cause flaccid paralysis.\n\n**Interaction Analysis:**\nPyrantel causes depolarization, pushing $V_m$ towards $E_{\\mathrm{cat}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Piperazine causes hyperpolarization, pushing $V_m$ towards $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. These are opposing physiological effects. When administered together, they partly counteract each other. The resulting potential, $V_{m, \\mathrm{Co}} = -45\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, is intermediate between the potentials achieved by either drug alone and, crucially, falls into the range between the two paralysis thresholds. In this state ($-62\\,\\mathrm{mV} < V_m < -40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), the muscle is not paralyzed. This is a classic example of **pharmacodynamic antagonism**, where the combined effect of two drugs is less than the effect of each drug administered alone. Since both drugs rely on causing paralysis (either spastic or flaccid) to be effective as antihelminthics (leading to expulsion of the worm), their coadministration, by canceling out the paralytic effect, is expected to reduce the overall therapeutic efficacy.\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Pharmacodynamic antagonism with reduced net paralysis; coadministration should diminish expulsion efficacy compared with either drug alone.**\nThis option correctly identifies the interaction as pharmacodynamic antagonism, as the depolarizing effect of pyrantel and hyperpolarizing effect of piperazine oppose each other. Our calculation showing $V_m = -45\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ (a non-paralytic potential) confirms this leads to reduced net paralysis. Logically, reduced paralysis would diminish the ability to expel the worm.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Pharmacodynamic synergy yielding stronger paralysis; coadministration should enhance expulsion efficacy beyond either drug alone.**\nThis option suggests synergy. Our calculation demonstrates the opposite: antagonism. The combined effect ($V_m = -45\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) is weaker (i.e., less paralytic) than either drug alone ($V_m = -20\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ or $V_m = -67.5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Pharmacokinetic antagonism via metabolic induction; coadministration should lower worm-site concentrations and thereby reduce efficacy.**\nThis option introduces a pharmacokinetic mechanism that is not part of the problem's scope. The problem provides fixed concentrations at the site of action and asks for an analysis based on the given biophysical (pharmacodynamic) model.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. No meaningful interaction; coadministration should be effectively additive with unchanged expulsion efficacy relative to the sum of individual effects.**\nThere is a very clear and meaningful interaction, which is antagonistic. The effects are not additive in a way that preserves or enhances efficacy; they cancel each other out at the physiological level, leading to a loss of efficacy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Host neurotoxicity predominates via additive GABAergic effects; coadministration should greatly increase central nervous system toxicity in the human host relative to either drug alone.**\nThis option shifts the focus to the human host, for which no data is provided. The entire problem is formulated around the nematode muscle fiber.

Both components are well-defined and fall within the expected scope of a STEM professional's expertise. The solution will proceed by first completing the calculation and then providing the requested evaluation as part of the reasoning.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary task is to calculate the total dose of ivermectin for the pediatric patient. The total dose, $D_{total}$, is the product of the patient's body mass, $m$, and the specified dose intensity, $D_{intensity}$.\n\nThe formula is:\n$$D_{total} = m \\times D_{intensity}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\n$$D_{total} = 15\\ \\text{kg} \\times 200\\ \\frac{\\mu\\text{g}}{\\text{kg}}$$\n$$D_{total} = 3000\\ \\mu\\text{g}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in milligrams (mg). The given conversion factor is $1\\ \\text{mg} = 10^3\\ \\mu\\text{g}$, or $1\\ \\text{mg} = 1000\\ \\mu\\text{g}$. To convert the dose from micrograms to milligrams, we divide by $1000$.\n\nLet $D_{\\text{mg}}$ be the dose in milligrams.\n$$D_{\\text{mg}} = \\frac{D_{total}}{1000\\ \\frac{\\mu\\text{g}}{\\text{mg}}}$$\n$$D_{\\text{mg}} = \\frac{3000\\ \\mu\\text{g}}{1000\\ \\frac{\\mu\\text{g}}{\\text{mg}}}$$\n$$D_{\\text{mg}} = 3\\ \\text{mg}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the final answer must be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value of $3$ has only one significant figure. To express this value with four significant figures, it must be written as $3.000$.\n\n### Evaluation of Formulation and Administration Challenges\n\nThe problem also requires an evaluation of the practical challenges in administering this calculated dose, which is a critical component of translating a theoretical calculation into effective clinical practice.\n\n1.  **Constraints Imposed by Available Solid Oral Dosage Strengths:** Ivermectin is most commonly manufactured in solid oral dosage forms (tablets) of $3\\ \\text{mg}$ and $6\\ \\text{mg}$ strengths. For this patient, the calculated dose of $3.000\\ \\text{mg}$ fortuitously matches the lowest available tablet strength. This simplifies administration, as one whole $3\\ \\text{mg}$ tablet provides the exact required dose, eliminating the need for tablet splitting or complex compounding, which are major sources of dosing error.\n\n2.  **Unit-Dose Accuracy for Extemporaneous Compounding:** For a pediatric patient weighing $15\\ \\text{kg}$ (typically around $3$-$4$ years of age), swallowing a whole tablet may not be feasible. Therefore, extemporaneous preparation is often necessary. The tablet must be crushed.\n    -   **Crushing a Whole Tablet:** For the $3.000\\ \\text{mg}$ dose, the entire $3\\ \\text{mg}$ tablet would be crushed using a mortar and pestle. While this avoids errors from dividing powder, it is still subject to physical loss of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) during transfer from the mortar to the administration vehicle (e.g., applesauce) and from the vehicle to the patient.\n    -   **Tablet Splitting (Hypothetical):** If the patient's weight had necessitated a dose not corresponding to a full tablet (e.g., a $10\\ \\text{kg}$ child needing $2\\ \\text{mg}$), a practitioner might be forced to split tablets. Ivermectin tablets are typically not scored, and even if they were, splitting does not guarantee that the API is uniformly distributed throughout the tablet's matrix. Crushing a larger tablet (e.g., $3\\ \\text{mg}$ or $6\\ \\text{mg}$) and attempting to volumetrically or gravimetrically partition the resulting powder without precision equipment is highly inaccurate and not recommended.\n\n3.  **Solubility and Stability for Aqueous Suspensions:** Ivermectin is a lipophilic compound, classified by the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) as Class II (low solubility, high permeability). It is practically insoluble in water. Attempting to create a simple aqueous suspension by crushing a tablet in water with a mortar and pestle would result in a mixture where the drug particles sediment rapidly and do not remain uniformly suspended. Drawing a specific volume with an oral syringe from such a mixture would lead to gross dosing inaccuracies, with a high probability of under- or over-dosing. Commercially available compounding vehicles (e.g., Ora-Plus®) are required to create a stable, uniform suspension, but the problem specifies such specialized equipment is not available. Furthermore, the stability of such extemporaneously prepared suspensions is often short and not well-characterized.\n\n4.  **Pharmacokinetics (Fed vs. Fasted State):** Systemic exposure to ivermectin is significantly affected by co-administration with food. Studies have demonstrated that administration with a high-fat meal can increase the area under the curve (AUC), a measure of total drug exposure, by a factor of $2$ to $2.5$. For treating strongyloidiasis, which involves tissue-migrating larvae, higher systemic concentrations are desirable for improved efficacy. Therefore, clinical guidelines often recommend taking ivermectin with food. However, this introduces variability, as the magnitude of the food effect depends on the meal's fat content. The clinical decision must weigh the potential for enhanced efficacy against the potential for increased dose-dependent adverse effects, which is particularly relevant given the patient's exclusion criteria (no CNS disorders, as ivermectin can have neurotoxic effects, especially if the blood-brain barrier is compromised).\n\n5.  **Palatability and Adherence:** Ivermectin has a bitter taste. Crushing the tablet and mixing it with a small volume of a palatable vehicle like juice, yogurt, or applesauce is a common strategy to mask the taste and facilitate administration to a child. However, this strategy risks incomplete dosing if the child does not consume the entire volume of the vehicle. Careful counseling of the caregiver is essential to ensure the entire dose is administered.\n\nIn summary, while the dose calculation is straightforward, its practical and safe administration to a $15\\ \\text{kg}$ child involves significant pharmaceutical and clinical considerations. The ideal scenario for this patient is the administration of a crushed, whole $3\\ \\text{mg}$ tablet mixed in a small amount of palatable food, with advice to consume with a meal to enhance absorption.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.000}\n$$", "id": "4622527"}]}
