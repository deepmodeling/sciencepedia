The rate of change of the amount of drug in the body, $A(t)$, is equal to the rate of drug input, $R_{\\text{in}}(t)$, minus the rate of drug elimination, $R_{\\text{out}}(t)$. This is expressed by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = R_{\\text{in}}(t) - R_{\\text{out}}(t)\n$$\nFor a linear pharmacokinetic model, the elimination rate is directly proportional to the plasma concentration, $C(t)$. The constant of proportionality is the systemic clearance, $CL$.\n$$\nR_{\\text{out}}(t) = CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the mass balance equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = R_{\\text{in}}(t) - CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nTo analyze the system over a 24-hour period, we integrate this equation from $t=0$ to $t=24$ hours.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{24} \\frac{dA(t)}{dt} \\,dt = \\int_{0}^{24} R_{\\text{in}}(t) \\,dt - \\int_{0}^{24} CL \\cdot C(t) \\,dt\n$$\nWe evaluate each term separately.\n\nThe left-hand side is the definite integral of the derivative of $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{24} \\frac{dA(t)}{dt} \\,dt = A(24) - A(0)\n$$\nThe problem states that the system is at steady state under periodic dosing. At steady state, the amount of drug in the body at the end of a full cycle is the same as the amount at the beginning. Considering a 24-hour period as one such cycle, we have $A(24) = A(0)$. Therefore, the net change is zero:\n$$\nA(24) - A(0) = 0\n$$\nThe first term on the right-hand side is the integral of the input rate over 24 hours. This represents the total amount of drug that enters the systemic circulation during that period.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{24} R_{\\text{in}}(t) \\,dt\n$$\nFor intravenous administration, the bioavailability is given as $1$, meaning the entire administered dose reaches the systemic circulation. This integral is therefore equal to the total daily dose, denoted as $D_{24}$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{24} R_{\\text{in}}(t) \\,dt = D_{24}\n$$\nThe second term on the right-hand side is the integral of the elimination rate. Since the model is time-invariant, the clearance $CL$ is a constant and can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{24} CL \\cdot C(t) \\,dt = CL \\cdot \\int_{0}^{24} C(t) \\,dt\n$$\nThe problem defines the 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve as $AUC_{24} = \\int_{0}^{24} C(t) \\,dt$.
