The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for the relationship between $\\text{EC}_{50}$ and $[dNTP]$, and the consequent change in the selectivity index, $\\text{SI}$.\n\n1.  **Condition for $50\\%$ Inhibition:** The problem defines $50\\%$ inhibition as the state where the rate of incorporation of the antiviral analog ($v_A$) is equal to the rate of incorporation of the natural substrate ($v_N$).\n    $$v_A = v_N$$\n2.  **Rate Laws:** The instantaneous rates for concentrations well below saturation are given as:\n    $$v_A = \\sigma_A [A\\text{-}TP]$$\n    $$v_N = \\sigma_N [dNTP]$$\n3.  **Required Intracellular Analog Concentration:** By substituting the rate laws into the inhibition condition, we can find the intracellular concentration of the analog triphosphate, $[A\\text{-}TP]$, required to achieve $50\\%$ inhibition. Let's call this concentration $[A\\text{-}TP]_{50}$.\n    $$\\sigma_A [A\\text{-}TP]_{50} = \\sigma_N [dNTP]$$\n    Solving for $[A\\text{-}TP]_{50}$:\n    $$[A\\text{-}TP]_{50} = \\frac{\\sigma_N}{\\sigma_A} [dNTP]$$\n4.  **Apply Empirical Data:** The problem states that the polymerase has equal catalytic efficiency for both substrates, meaning $\\sigma_A = \\sigma_N$.\n    $$[A\\text{-}TP]_{50} = \\frac{\\sigma_N}{\\sigma_N} [dNTP] = [dNTP]$$\n    This result is fundamental: to achieve a $1:1$ incorporation ratio ($50\\%$ inhibition) when the enzyme's specificities are equal, the concentrations of the two competing substrates must also be equal.\n5.  **Relate to $\\text{EC}_{50}$:** The $\\text{EC}_{50}$ is defined as the extracellular drug concentration that produces the required intracellular $[A\\text{-}TP]_{50}$. For conceptual problems of this nature where the focus is on the competitive dynamics, it is standard to assume a direct, often $1:1$, relationship between the measured $\\text{EC}_{50}$ and the required active intracellular concentration. This is implicitly confirmed by the structure of Option A. Therefore, we can set $\\text{EC}_{50} = [A\\text{-}TP]_{50}$.\n    $$\\text{EC}_{50} = [dNTP]$$\n    This shows that $\\text{EC}_{50}$ is directly and linearly proportional to the intracellular concentration of the natural substrate, $[dNTP]$.\n6.  **Calculate $\\text{EC}_{50}$ in a Resting vs. Activated State:**\n    *   For the resting-state pool: $[dNTP] = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, so $\\text{EC}_{50,\\text{resting}} = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n    *   For the activated-state pool: $[dNTP] = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, so $\\text{EC}_{50,\\text{activated}} = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n    As the cell transitions from a resting to an activated state, the $\\text{EC}_{50}$ of the drug increases tenfold.\n7.  **Calculate Selectivity Index ($\\text{SI}$):** The selectivity index is defined as $\\text{SI} = \\text{CC}_{50} / \\text{EC}_{50}$. The cytotoxicity, $\\text{CC}_{50}$, is given as a constant $500\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n    *   For the resting-state pool:\n        $$\\text{SI}_{\\text{resting}} = \\frac{\\text{CC}_{50}}{\\text{EC}_{50,\\text{resting}}} = \\frac{500\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 100$$\n    *   For the activated-state pool:\n        $$\\text{SI}_{\\text{activated}} = \\frac{\\text{CC}_{50}}{\\text{EC}_{50,\\text{activated}}} = \\frac{500\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 10$$\n8.  **Conclusion:** As the intracellular $[dNTP]$ pool increases from $5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, the $\\text{EC}_{50}$ increases from $5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. Consequently, the selectivity index $\\text{SI}$ decreases from $100$ to $10$. A lower $\\text{SI}$ indicates a narrower therapeutic window, as the effective concentration is closer to the toxic concentration.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The selectivity index is $\\text{SI} = \\text{CC}_{50}/\\text{EC}_{50}$. Under competitive incorporation with $\\sigma_A = \\sigma_N$, $\\text{EC}_{50}$ scales linearly with $[dNTP]$ such that $\\text{EC}_{50} = [dNTP]$. Therefore, $\\text{EC}_{50}$ increases from $5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ as $[dNTP]$ increases, and with $\\text{CC}_{50} = 500\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $\\text{SI}$ falls from $100$ to $10$, indicating a narrower therapeutic window in the activated-state pool.**\nThis option correctly states the definition of $\\text{SI}$. It correctly derives the relationship $\\text{EC}_{50} = [dNTP]$ under the given conditions. It correctly calculates the values for $\\text{EC}_{50}$ in both states ($5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$). It correctly calculates the resulting $\\text{SI}$ values ($100$ and $10$). Finally, it correctly interprets a falling $\\text{SI}$ as a narrowing therapeutic window. Every part of this statement is consistent with the derivation from first principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The selectivity index is $\\text{SI} = \\text{EC}_{50}/\\text{CC}_{50}$. Because higher $[dNTP]$ increases competition, $\\text{EC}_{50}$ decreases, so $\\text{SI}$ decreases and the therapeutic window narrows as $[dNTP]$ rises from $5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.**\nThis option incorrectly defines the selectivity index as $\\text{SI} = \\text{EC}_{50}/\\text{CC}_{50}$. The standard definition, also provided in the problem, is $\\text{SI} = \\text{CC}_{50} / \\text{EC}_{50}$ to ensure a value greater than $1$ indicates selective action. Furthermore, it incorrectly states that $\\text{EC}_{50}$ decreases. Increased competition from $[dNTP]$ necessitates a higher concentration of the analog to be effective, thus $\\text{EC}_{50}$ must increase.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The selectivity index does not change with $[dNTP]$ because $\\text{CC}_{50}$ is constant across conditions; changes in $[dNTP]$ influence only efficacy, not the therapeutic window.**\nThis option presents flawed logic. The selectivity index is a ratio, $\\text{SI} = \\text{CC}_{50} / \\text{EC}_{50}$. While $\\text{CC}_{50}$ is constant, $\\text{EC}_{50}$ changes as a function of $[dNTP]$. Therefore, $\\text{SI}$ must also change. The therapeutic window, which is quantified by $\\text{SI}$, is directly affected by changes in efficacy ($\\text{EC}_{50}$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Higher $[dNTP]$ reduces the probability of analog incorporation, so a lower $\\text{EC}_{50}$ is needed to maintain $50\\%$ inhibition; with $\\text{CC}_{50} = 500\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $\\text{SI}$ increases and the therapeutic window widens as $[dNTP]$ rises from $5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.**\nThis option starts with a correct premise (higher $[dNTP]$ reduces a fixed analog's incorporation probability) but draws an incorrect conclusion. To overcome the increased competition and restore the $50\\%$ inhibition level, a *higher*, not lower, concentration of the analog is required. Therefore, $\\text{EC}_{50}$ must increase. This fundamental error invalidates the subsequent conclusions that $\\text{SI}$ increases and the therapeutic window widens.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4625595"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of antiviral therapy is to control infection within the host, a process we can model using pharmacodynamics.

At pretreatment steady-state, net virion production equals clearance.\n    2. $EC_{50}$ is the drug concentration for half-maximal effect.\n    3. The circulating virion pool relaxes exponentially toward a new steady-state under constant fractional suppression of viral production.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, employing a standard and widely accepted first-phase viral kinetic model. The parameters provided ($V_0$, $C$, $EC_{50}$, $h$, $c$) are realistic for chronic HBV infection treated with entecavir. The mathematical framework is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation, which is well-posed. The problem is stated objectively, with clear, unambiguous terminology and sufficient data to derive a unique solution. It does not violate any fundamental principles of virology, pharmacology, or mathematics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution is warranted.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe dynamics of the viral load $V(t)$ are described by the differential equation that balances viral production $P(t)$ and clearance:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = P(t) - cV(t)\n$$\nHere, $c = 0.60$ day$^{-1}$ is the first-order rate constant for virion clearance.\n\nAt the pretreatment steady-state ($t < 0$), the viral load is constant at $V_0$. Thus, $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$. The production rate is at its baseline level, $P_0$. The steady-state condition implies that production equals clearance:\n$$\nP_0 - cV_0 = 0 \\implies P_0 = cV_0\n$$\n\nFor $t \\geq 0$, antiviral therapy with entecavir is initiated. The drug suppresses viral production. The efficacy of the drug, $\\epsilon$, which is the fractional reduction in viral production, is determined by the drug concentration $C$ according to the sigmoidal Hill equation for inhibition:\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{C^h}{EC_{50}^h + C^h}\n$$\nThe problem states that the drug concentration $C = 5.0$ ng/mL is constant. Therefore, the efficacy $\\epsilon$ is also constant for the duration of the analysis. The new, suppressed viral production rate, $P_{\\text{new}}$, is given by:\n$$\nP_{\\text{new}} = (1 - \\epsilon)P_0\n$$\nSubstituting $P_0 = cV_0$, we get:\n$$\nP_{\\text{new}} = (1 - \\epsilon)cV_0\n$$\nThe differential equation for $V(t)$ for $t \\geq 0$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = (1 - \\epsilon)cV_0 - cV(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation with the initial condition $V(0) = V_0$. We can rearrange it as:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} + cV(t) = (1 - \\epsilon)cV_0\n$$\nThe solution to this equation with the specified initial condition is:\n$$\nV(t) = (1-\\epsilon)V_0 + (V_0 - (1-\\epsilon)V_0)e^{-ct}\n$$\n$$\nV(t) = (1-\\epsilon)V_0 + \\epsilon V_0 e^{-ct}\n$$\n$$\nV(t) = V_0 \\left[ (1-\\epsilon) + \\epsilon e^{-ct} \\right]\n$$\nThis equation describes the expected time course of the serum HBV DNA load, $V(t)$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the magnitude of the base-$10$ logarithmic reduction in HBV DNA at $t = 84$ days. This quantity, $\\Delta \\log_{10} V$, is defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta \\log_{10} V = \\log_{10}(V_0) - \\log_{10}(V(t)) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{V_0}{V(t)}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{V_0}{V(t)} = \\frac{V_0}{V_0 \\left[ (1-\\epsilon) + \\epsilon e^{-ct} \\right]} = \\frac{1}{(1-\\epsilon) + \\epsilon e^{-ct}}\n$$\nThus, the log reduction is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\log_{10} V = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{1}{(1-\\epsilon) + \\epsilon e^{-ct}}\\right) = -\\log_{10}\\left((1-\\epsilon) + \\epsilon e^{-ct}\\right)\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the efficacy $\\epsilon$ using the given parameters: $C = 5.0$ ng/mL, $EC_{50} = 0.80$ ng/mL, and $h=2$.\n$$\n\\frac{C}{EC_{50}} = \\frac{5.0}{0.80} = 6.25\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{(6.25)^2}{1 + (6.25)^2} = \\frac{39.0625}{1 + 39.0625} = \\frac{39.0625}{40.0625}\n$$\nThe fraction of remaining production is $(1-\\epsilon)$:\n$$\n1-\\epsilon = 1 - \\frac{39.0625}{40.0625} = \\frac{1}{40.0625}\n$$\nNow we evaluate the argument of the logarithm at $t = 84$ days, with $c = 0.60$ day$^{-1}$:\n$$\n(1-\\epsilon) + \\epsilon e^{-ct} = \\frac{1}{40.0625} + \\frac{39.0625}{40.0625} \\exp(-(0.60)(84))\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{40.0625} + \\frac{39.0625}{40.0625} \\exp(-50.4)\n$$\nThe term $\\exp(-50.4)$ is exceedingly small, approximately $1.43 \\times 10^{-22}$. Its contribution to the sum is therefore negligible for the required precision. The expression is dominated by the first term, which represents the new steady state.\n$$\n(1-\\epsilon) + \\epsilon e^{-ct} \\approx \\frac{1}{40.0625}\n$$\nThe log reduction is then:\n$$\n\\Delta \\log_{10} V \\approx -\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{1}{40.0625}\\right) = \\log_{10}(40.0625)\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\log_{10}(40.0625) \\approx 1.60274029\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $1.603$.\n\nThe problem also asks for a comment on the clinical benchmark of a decline of at least $1.0$ $\\log_{10}$ at week $12$. Since the calculated reduction is $1.603$ $\\log_{10}$, and $1.603 > 1.0$, this benchmark for an adequate early virologic response is met and exceeded.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.603}\n$$", "id": "4625625"}]}
