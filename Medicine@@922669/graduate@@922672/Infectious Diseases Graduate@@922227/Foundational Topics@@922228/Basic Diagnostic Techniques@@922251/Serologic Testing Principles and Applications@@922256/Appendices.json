The assay reports a dimensionless raw signal, called an index, that is proportional to the concentration of binding antibodies under validated operating conditions. The laboratory has aligned its assay to the World Health Organization (WHO) International Standard for antibodies, which defines Binding Antibody Units per milliliter (BAU/mL) as the standardized concentration unit. Calibration against the WHO International Standard yielded a lot-specific linear mapping from index to BAU/mL with slope $k$ and a statistically negligible intercept across the validated analytical measuring interval. For the current reagent lot, the slope is $k = 0.142$ BAU/mL per index.\n\nThree patient samples produced raw index values $I_{1} = 12$, $I_{2} = 35$, and $I_{3} = 80$, all within the assay’s validated linear range.

It presents a standard calibration problem in analytical chemistry and clinical diagnostics, free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe problem states that the concentration of binding antibodies, $C$, measured in Binding Antibody Units per milliliter (BAU/mL), is related to a dimensionless raw signal, the index $I$, by a lot-specific linear mapping. The general form of a linear relationship is:\n$$\nC(I) = mI + b\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, this linear mapping has a slope $k$ and a \"statistically negligible intercept.\" This is a formal instruction to model the relationship with an intercept of zero. Therefore, we set $m = k$ and $b = 0$. The governing equation simplifies to a direct proportionality:\n$$\nC = kI\n$$\nThe value of the slope for the current reagent lot is provided as:\n$$\nk = 0.142 \\text{ BAU/mL per index}\n$$\nThe problem requires the conversion of three raw index values, $I_{1} = 12$, $I_{2} = 35$, and $I_{3} = 80$, into their corresponding concentrations in BAU/mL.

This exercise [@problem_id:4691012] challenges you to apply Bayes' theorem to calculate a test's positive and negative predictive values ($PPV$ and $NPV$). By working through this classic scenario, you will gain a crucial understanding of how pre-test probability can dramatically alter the reliability of a positive result, a foundational concept for designing and interpreting screening programs.", "problem": "An academic public health team is evaluating a serologic screening program for an emerging viral infection using an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Assume a closed population in which the infection status at the time of testing is static, and let the pre-test probability of infection equal the population prevalence. The assay has sensitivity $Se$ and specificity $Sp$. By definition, sensitivity is the probability of a positive result given true infection, and specificity is the probability of a negative result given true non-infection.

Let $P(D)$ be the prevalence of the infection, which is also the pre-test probability.\n- Prevalence: $P(D) = 0.02$.\n- The probability of not being infected is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98$.\n- Sensitivity ($Se$): The probability of a positive test given infection, $Se = P(T^+ | D) = 0.95$.\n- Specificity ($Sp$): The probability of a negative test given non-infection, $Sp = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.98$.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can derive the probabilities of the complementary events:\n- The probability of a false negative is $P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n- The probability of a false positive is $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$.\n\nThe task is to derive expressions for $PPV$ and $NPV$ from first principles and compute their values.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation of Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\n\nThe $PPV$ is the probability of being infected given a positive test result, which is the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$. We use Bayes' theorem to find this value:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. It can be found by applying the law of total probability, summing over the two possible states of infection:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nThis expression represents the sum of the probabilities of true positives and false positives. Substituting the symbols for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se \\cdot P(D)) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot P(D^c))$$\n$$P(T^+) = (Se \\cdot P(D)) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P(D)))$$\nNow, we substitute this back into the formula for $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot P(D)}{Se \\cdot P(D) + (1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P(D))}$$\nThis is the derived expression for $PPV$ from first principles.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the given data: $Se = 0.95$, $Sp = 0.98$, and $P(D) = 0.02$.\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.95 \\cdot 0.02}{0.95 \\cdot 0.02 + (1 - 0.98) \\cdot (1 - 0.02)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.019}{0.019 + (0.02 \\cdot 0.98)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.019}{0.019 + 0.0196}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.019}{0.0386} \\approx 0.492227979...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $PPV = 0.4922$.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation of Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\n\nThe $NPV$ is the probability of not being infected given a negative test result, which is the conditional probability $P(D^c | T^-)$. Again, we use Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of obtaining a negative test result. Using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)$$\nThis represents the sum of the probabilities of true negatives and false negatives. Substituting the symbols:\n$$P(T^-) = (Sp \\cdot P(D^c)) + ((1 - Se) \\cdot P(D))$$\n$$P(T^-) = (Sp \\cdot (1 - P(D))) + ((1 - Se) \\cdot P(D))$$\nSubstituting this back into the formula for $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1 - P(D))}{Sp \\cdot (1 - P(D)) + (1 - Se) \\cdot P(D)}$$\nThis is the derived expression for $NPV$ from first principles.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.98 \\cdot (1 - 0.02)}{0.98 \\cdot (1 - 0.02) + (1 - 0.95) \\cdot 0.02}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.98 \\cdot 0.98}{0.98 \\cdot 0.98 + 0.05 \\cdot 0.02}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.9604}{0.9604 + 0.001}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.9604}{0.9614} \\approx 0.998959850...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $NPV = 0.9990$.\n\n**Interpretation of Results**\n\nThe computed $PPV$ is $0.4922$ and the $NPV$ is $0.9990$.\nThe very high $NPV$ ($99.90\\%$) implies that a negative test result is extremely reliable. If a person tests negative, it is almost certain that they do not have the infection. This makes the test very effective for ruling out the disease.\n\nIn stark contrast, the $PPV$ is low at $0.4922$ ($49.22\\%$). This signifies that a positive test result is highly unreliable for confirming the infection. For an individual who tests positive, the probability of them actually being infected is less than $50\\%$. The chance of a false positive is slightly greater than the chance of a true positive.\n\nThis discrepancy is a classic illustration of the effect of prevalence (the pre-test probability) on predictive values. Even with a high specificity of $98\\%$, the low prevalence of $2\\%$ means that the absolute number of healthy individuals is very large compared to the number of infected individuals. Consequently, the small fraction of false positives from the large healthy population ($98,000$ out of $100,000$, yielding $1,960$ false positives) becomes comparable in number to the true positives from the small infected population ($2,000$ out of $100,000$, yielding $1,900$ true positives). This makes a positive result ambiguous.\n\nThe implication for population screening is that this ELISA is an excellent tool for ruling out the infection but is a poor tool for confirmation in a low-prevalence setting. A positive screening result should not be considered definitive and must be followed up with a more specific, confirmatory test to minimize misdiagnosis and unnecessary anxiety or treatment. The reliability of a positive result heavily depends on the pre-test probability, whereas the reliability of a negative result is less affected under these conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.4922 & 0.9990 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4691012"}, {"introduction": "Real-world diagnostic decisions rarely hinge on a single test; instead, they rely on carefully constructed testing algorithms that combine multiple assays to maximize accuracy and efficiency.
