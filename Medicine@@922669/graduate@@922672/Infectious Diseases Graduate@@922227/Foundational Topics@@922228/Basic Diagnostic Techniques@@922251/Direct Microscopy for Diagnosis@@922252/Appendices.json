For the diseased group, $N(T^{+} \\cap D) + N(T^{-} \\cap D) = 80 + 20 = 100$, which equals $N(D)$. For the non-diseased group, the number of $T^{-}$ individuals is implicitly defined and calculable.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe performance of a diagnostic test is characterized by its ability to correctly identify individuals with and without the disease. These characteristics are formally defined using conditional probabilities, which are estimated from sample counts. The sample space is partitioned by the disease state, $\\{D, \\bar{D}\\}$, and the test outcome, $\\{T^{+}, T^{-}\\}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy based on the principles of conditional probability. The probability of an event $A$ given an event $B$ is $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$. In this frequentist context, we estimate these probabilities using the number of individuals, $N$, in each category.\n\n1.  **Sensitivity**: Sensitivity is the probability that the test is positive, given that the individual is truly infected. It measures the test's ability to correctly identify those with the disease.\n    $$\n    \\text{Sensitivity} = P(T^{+} | D) = \\frac{N(T^{+} \\cap D)}{N(D)}\n    $$\n    The term $N(T^{+} \\cap D)$ represents the number of true positives ($TP$), and $N(D)$ is the total number of infected individuals, which is the sum of true positives ($TP$) and false negatives ($FN$), where $FN = N(T^{-} \\cap D)$. Thus,\n    $$\n    \\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Specificity**: Specificity is the probability that the test is negative, given that the individual is truly uninfected. It measures the test's ability to correctly identify those without the disease.\n    $$\n    \\text{Specificity} = P(T^{-} | \\bar{D}) = \\frac{N(T^{-} \\cap \\bar{D})}{N(\\bar{D})}\n    $$\n    The term $N(T^{-} \\cap \\bar{D})$ represents the number of true negatives ($TN$), and $N(\\bar{D})$ is the total number of uninfected individuals, which is the sum of true negatives ($TN$) and false positives ($FP$), where $FP = N(T^{+} \\cap \\bar{D})$. Thus,\n    $$\n    \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Accuracy**: Accuracy is the overall probability that the test gives a correct result for any randomly chosen individual from the population. A correct result is either a true positive or a true negative.\n    $$\n    \\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{N(\\text{Correct Results})}{N(\\text{Total Population})} = \\frac{N(T^{+} \\cap D) + N(T^{-} \\cap \\bar{D})}{N(D) + N(\\bar{D})}\n    $$\n    In terms of $TP$, $TN$, $FP$, and $FN$, this is:\n    $$\n    \\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}\n    $$\n\nNext, we calculate these metrics using the provided data. We first organize the data into a contingency table.\n\nFrom the givens:\n-   True Positives ($TP$): $N(T^{+} \\cap D) = 80$.\n-   False Negatives ($FN$): $N(T^{-} \\cap D) = 20$.\n-   Total Infected: $N(D) = TP + FN = 80 + 20 = 100$.
