The full series is $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^k = (1+x)^n$.\nTherefore, $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} x^k = (1+x)^n - 1$.\nThe final derived form for the apparent association constant is:\n$$\nK_{A}^{\\mathrm{app}} = \\frac{(1 + K_A C_{\\mathrm{eff}})^n - 1}{C_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\n$$\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the avidity advantage ratio $R$.\nFirst, we calculate the intrinsic affinity $K_A$ from the given $K_D$:\n$$\nK_A = \\frac{1}{K_D} = \\frac{1}{5.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{M}} = 2.0 \\times 10^5 \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\n$$\nFor monomeric IgG, the effective valency is $n = n_{\\mathrm{g}} = 1$.\n$$\nK_{A}^{\\mathrm{app,IgG}} = \\frac{(1 + K_A C_{\\mathrm{eff}})^{1} - 1}{C_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{K_A C_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{C_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = K_A\n$$\nThus, $K_{A}^{\\mathrm{app,IgG}} = 2.0 \\times 10^5 \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1}$. This is expected, as a monovalent interaction has no avidity gain.\n\nFor pentameric IgM, the effective valency is given as $n = n_{\\mathrm{m}} = 3$. We first compute the dimensionless product $K_A C_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\nK_A C_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (2.0 \\times 10^5 \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{M}) = 400\n$$\nNow we compute $K_{A}^{\\mathrm{app,IgM}}$:\n$$\nK_{A}^{\\mathrm{app,IgM}} = \\frac{(1 + 400)^{3} - 1}{2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{401^{3} - 1}{2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{M}}\n$$\nCalculating the numerator: $401^{3} - 1 = 64481201 - 1 = 64481200$.\n$$\nK_{A}^{\\mathrm{app,IgM}} = \\frac{64481200}{2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{M}} = 32240600000 \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1} = 3.22406 \\times 10^{10} \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\n$$\nThe avidity advantage ratio $R$ is:\n$$\nR = \\frac{K_{A}^{\\mathrm{app,IgM}}}{K_{A}^{\\mathrm{app,IgG}}} = \\frac{3.22406 \\times 10^{10} \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1}}{2.0 \\times 10^5 \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1}} = 1.61203 \\times 10^5\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $R = 1.612 \\times 10^5$.\n\nPart 3: Interpretation of binding outcome.\nWe compare the fraction of bound antigenic patches, $f = \\frac{K_{A}^{\\mathrm{app}} [\\mathrm{Ab}]}{1 + K_{A}^{\\mathrm{app}} [\\mathrm{Ab}]}$, at an antibody concentration of $[\\mathrm{Ab}] = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\mathrm{M}$.\n\nFor IgG:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{IgG}} = \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^5 \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1})(1.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\mathrm{M})}{1 + (2.0 \\times 10^5 \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1})(1.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\mathrm{M})} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{1 + 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{0.002}{1.002} \\approx 0.001996\n$$\nThis corresponds to approximately $0.2\\%$ of patches being bound, which is negligible.\n\nFor IgM:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{IgM}} = \\frac{(3.22406 \\times 10^{10} \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1})(1.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\mathrm{M})}{1 + (3.22406 \\times 10^{10} \\, \\mathrm{M}^{-1})(1.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\mathrm{M})} = \\frac{322.406}{1 + 322.406} = \\frac{322.406}{323.406} \\approx 0.9969\n$$\nThis corresponds to approximately $99.7\\%$ of patches being bound, indicating near-complete saturation.\nThe interpretation is clear: despite having the same intrinsic per-site affinity, the multivalent nature of IgM confers a massive avidity advantage (over $160,000$-fold) compared to the functionally monovalent IgG in this scenario. This allows IgM to bind pathogens with extreme effectiveness even at low concentrations where IgG binding is negligible.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.612 \\times 10^{5}}\n$$", "id": "4627673"}]}
