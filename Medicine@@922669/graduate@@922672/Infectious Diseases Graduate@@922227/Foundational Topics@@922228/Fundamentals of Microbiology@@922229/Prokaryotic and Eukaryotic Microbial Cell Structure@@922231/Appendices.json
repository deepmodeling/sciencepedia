The application of this mechanical model to a biological structure like a bacterium is a standard and accepted practice in biophysics. The problem parameters are biologically plausible.\n\nThe derivation for the minimum wall thickness, $t_{\\min}$, proceeds from a force balance on a free-body diagram of the cylindrical cell. We consider a transverse cut through the cylinder, perpendicular to its axis. The forces acting along the axial direction must sum to zero for static equilibrium.\n\nThere are two primary forces to consider:\n1.  The force exerted by the internal turgor pressure, $P$, on the circular cross-sectional area of the cylinder's interior. This force, $F_{P}$, acts to push the two halves of the cylinder apart. The internal area is $A_{c} = \\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius.\n    $$F_{P} = P \\cdot A_{c} = P \\pi r^2$$\n\n2.  The resistive force in the material of the cell wall, $F_{\\text{wall}}$, which arises from the axial (or longitudinal) tensile stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{axial}}$. This stress is distributed over the cross-sectional area of the wall material. Since the wall is assumed to be thin ($t \\ll r$), its cross-sectional area, $A_{\\text{wall}}$, can be accurately approximated as the product of the cylinder's circumference and the wall thickness, $t$.\n    $$A_{\\text{wall}} \\approx 2\\pi r t$$\n    The total resistive force is then:\n    $$F_{\\text{wall}} = \\sigma_{\\text{axial}} \\cdot A_{\\text{wall}} = \\sigma_{\\text{axial}} (2\\pi r t)$$\n\nFor the cell to be in equilibrium, these two opposing forces must be equal in magnitude:\n$$F_{P} = F_{\\text{wall}}$$\n$$P \\pi r^2 = \\sigma_{\\text{axial}} (2\\pi r t)$$\n\nWe can now solve for the axial stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{axial}}$, in the cylinder wall:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{axial}} = \\frac{P \\pi r^2}{2\\pi r t} = \\frac{Pr}{2t}$$\n\nThe problem states that fracture is avoided if the axial stress does not exceed the allowable stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{allow}}$. The allowable stress is defined in terms of the ultimate tensile strength, $\\sigma_{u}$, and a safety factor, $n$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{allow}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{u}}{n}$$\nTherefore, the condition for structural integrity is:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{axial}} \\le \\sigma_{\\text{allow}}$$\n$$\\frac{Pr}{2t} \\le \\frac{\\sigma_{u}}{n}$$\n\nThe minimum required thickness, $t_{\\min}$, is the thickness for which the axial stress is exactly equal to the allowable stress.

This practice challenges you to move beyond a generic view of the lipid bilayer and consider how specific molecules—ergosterol in eukaryotes, hopanoids in bacteria, and unique tetraether lipids in archaea—profoundly shape membrane properties. By reasoning from first principles of thermodynamics and molecular packing, you will predict how these compositional differences translate into varying susceptibilities to membrane-disrupting agents, illustrating a core principle of microbial diversity and pharmacology [@problem_id:4685688].", "problem": "A laboratory of infectious disease biology prepares large unilamellar vesicles from three microbial pathogens to isolate the role of membrane lipid composition in susceptibility to membrane-disrupting agents. Vesicles are prepared from: (i) a pathogenic yeast that has a plasma membrane with approximately $25\\%$ ergosterol; (ii) a Gram-negative bacterium whose inner membrane contains approximately $8\\%$ hopanoids; and (iii) a hyperthermophilic archaeon whose membrane is a glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) monolayer with multiple cyclopentane rings per biphytanyl chain.

They lack specific sterol-binding.\n4.  **Question:** Predict the relative susceptibility of the vesicles (yeast, bacterium, archaeon) to the polyene antifungal and the non-ionic detergent.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of membrane biophysics and microbiology. The descriptions of ergosterol, hopanoids, and archaeal GDGT lipids and their effects on membrane order and fluidity are factually correct. The mechanisms of action for polyene antifungals (specific ergosterol binding) and non-ionic detergents (non-specific partitioning) are accurately represented. The experimental design using large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) is a standard method in the field.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a complete set of premises (membrane compositions, agent mechanisms, physical principles) required to deduce a relative ranking of susceptibility. The question is unambiguous and asks for a qualitative comparison, which is directly derivable from the given information. A unique, logical conclusion exists.\n*   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or opinion-based statements. All terms are either defined within the problem or have standard, unambiguous meanings in a scientific context.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## Derivation of Solution\n\nThe solution requires determining the relative susceptibility of the three types of vesicles to two different agents: a polyene antifungal and a non-ionic detergent. Susceptibility is proportional to the extent an agent perturbs the membrane, which is primarily driven by how readily the agent partitions into the membrane. This is governed by the free energy of insertion, $\\Delta G$. A more negative $\\Delta G$ implies a higher partition coefficient $K$ and thus higher susceptibility.\n\nLet the susceptibility of a vesicle type to an agent be denoted as $S$. The three vesicle types are denoted Yeast, Bacterium, and Archaeon.\n\n### 1. Susceptibility to Polyene Antifungal\n\nThe mechanism of polyene antifungals is based on **specific, exergonic binding to ergosterol**. This specific interaction provides a large, negative contribution to $\\Delta G$, making insertion highly favorable. The problem states that binding to hopanoids and archaeal lipids is poor or negligible.\n\n*   **Yeast Vesicles:** These membranes contain approximately $25\\%$ ergosterol. The polyene will specifically bind to the abundant ergosterol, leading to a very negative $\\Delta G_{insertion}$. This results in a high partition coefficient $K$, efficient pore formation, and thus very high susceptibility.\n    $S_{polyene}^{Yeast}$ is very high.\n*   **Bacterium Vesicles:** These membranes contain hopanoids. The problem explicitly states that polyenes bind hopanoids *poorly or negligibly*. Therefore, the specific binding interaction that dramatically lowers $\\Delta G$ is absent. The only interaction is nonspecific partitioning, which is disfavored by the membrane ordering effect of the hopanoids. Thus, susceptibility will be very low.\n    $S_{polyene}^{Bacterium}$ is very low.\n*   **Archaeon Vesicles:** These are GDGT monolayers. The problem states that polyenes bind these structures *poorly or negligibly*. Furthermore, these membranes possess the highest intrinsic order and rigidity, making them highly resistant to penetration by any agent. Thus, nonspecific partitioning is extremely unfavorable.\n    $S_{polyene}^{Archaeon}$ is very low, likely the lowest of all three.\n\n**Ranking for Polyene Antifungal:** The yeast vesicle is uniquely susceptible due to its high ergosterol content. The bacterium and archaeon vesicles are both highly resistant due to the lack of a specific target. Their susceptibilities are both very low and can be considered approximately equal in comparison to the yeast.\nTherefore, the relative susceptibility is: $S_{polyene}^{Yeast} > S_{polyene}^{Bacterium} \\approx S_{polyene}^{Archaeon}$.\n\n### 2. Susceptibility to Non-ionic Detergent\n\nThe mechanism of non-ionic detergents is based on **nonspecific partitioning**, which is favored by *lower membrane order and packing density*. Resistance to these detergents is therefore directly proportional to membrane order and rigidity.\n\nWe must first rank the three membranes by their physical order and rigidity, from most ordered to least ordered.\n\n1.  **Archaeon Vesicles:** The GDGT monolayer with cyclopentane rings is described as conferring *even higher order and rigidity* and forming *chemically stable monolayers that strongly resist penetration*. This is the most ordered and most resistant membrane.\n2.  **Yeast Vesicles:** With $25\\%$ ergosterol, these membranes are significantly ordered and condensed. The problem states ergosterol increases order ($S$) and the bending modulus ($k_c$). This high degree of order will confer significant resistance to nonspecific partitioning.\n3.  **Bacterium Vesicles:** With $8\\%$ hopanoids, these membranes also experience an ordering effect. However, the concentration of the ordering agent ($8\\%$) is substantially lower than in the yeast membranes ($25\\%$). Additionally, a bacterial inner membrane is generally less packed than a sterol-rich eukaryotic plasma membrane. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the bacterial vesicle membrane is less ordered than the yeast vesicle membrane.\n\nThe rank order of membrane rigidity/order is: Archaeon $>$ Yeast $>$ Bacterium.\n\nSince susceptibility to non-ionic detergents is inversely proportional to membrane order, the susceptibility ranking is the reverse of the order ranking.\n\n**Ranking for Non-ionic Detergent:** The least ordered membrane (bacterium) will be the most susceptible. The most ordered membrane (archaeon) will be the least susceptible.\nTherefore, the relative susceptibility is: $S_{detergent}^{Bacterium} > S_{detergent}^{Yeast} > S_{detergent}^{Archaeon}$.\n\n### 3. Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nCombining the two derived rankings:\n*   **Polyene antifungal susceptibility:** Yeast $>$ bacterium $\\approx$ archaeon\n*   **Non-ionic detergent susceptibility:** Bacterium $>$ yeast $>$ archaeon\n\nNow we evaluate the given options against this derived result.\n\n**A. Polyene antifungal: yeast $>$ bacterium $\\approx$ archaeon; non-ionic detergent: bacterium $>$ yeast $>$ archaeon.**\nThis option perfectly matches both of our derived rankings. The polyene ranking correctly identifies the unique susceptibility of the ergosterol-containing yeast membrane. The detergent ranking correctly identifies susceptibility as being inversely proportional to membrane order (Archaeon $>$ Yeast $>$ Bacterium).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Polyene antifungal: bacterium $>$ yeast $>$ archaeon; non-ionic detergent: yeast $>$ bacterium $>$ archaeon.**\nThe polyene ranking is incorrect. It fails to recognize that specific binding to ergosterol makes the yeast membrane the most susceptible. The detergent ranking is also incorrect, as it implies the yeast membrane is less ordered than the bacterial membrane, contrary to the effects of a high ($25\\%$) concentration of an ordering agent (ergosterol) versus a lower ($8\\%$) concentration (hopanoids).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Polyene antifungal: archaeon $>$ bacterium $>$ yeast; non-ionic detergent: archaeon $>$ yeast $>$ bacterium.**\nThis option presents rankings that are the reverse of the correct ones. It incorrectly suggests that the most ordered and rigid membranes are the most susceptible to both agents, which contradicts the stated mechanisms of action.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Polyene antifungal: yeast $\\approx$ bacterium $>$ archaeon; non-ionic detergent: yeast $\\approx$ bacterium $\\approx$ archaeon.**\nThe polyene ranking is incorrect because the susceptibility of yeast vesicles is substantially greater than that of bacterial vesicles ($S_{polyene}^{Yeast} \\gg S_{polyene}^{Bacterium}$) due to specific ergosterol binding. The detergent ranking is incorrect because it ignores the significant, stated differences in membrane order and composition among the three vesicle types.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4685688"}, {"introduction": "Gram-negative bacteria possess an additional protective layer, the outer membrane, which acts as a selective barrier against many environmental threats, including antibiotics.

There are no subjective elements.\n\n**Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a complete solution.\n\n**Derivation of Total Influx Rate**\n\nThe derivation begins with Fick's first law of diffusion in one dimension. This law states that the molar flux density, $j$ (moles per unit area per unit time), is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient.\n$$\nj = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}\n$$\nHere, $x$ is the position along the axis of the cylindrical pore, and $C(x)$ is the concentration of the antibiotic at position $x$. The pore extends from $x=0$ (external side) to $x=L$ (periplasmic side).\n\nThe problem states that the concentration profile within the pore is linear at steady state. This implies that the concentration gradient $\\frac{dC}{dx}$ is constant along the pore's length. We can calculate this constant gradient using the boundary conditions:\n-   At $x=0$, the concentration is $C(0) = C_{\\text{out}}$.\n-   At $x=L$, the concentration is $C(L) = C_{\\text{in}}$.\n\nThe gradient is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{C(L) - C(0)}{L - 0} = \\frac{C_{\\text{in}} - C_{\\text{out}}}{L}\n$$\nSubstituting this into Fick's first law:\n$$\nj = -D \\left( \\frac{C_{\\text{in}} - C_{\\text{out}}}{L} \\right) = D \\frac{C_{\\text{out}} - C_{\\text{in}}}{L}\n$$\nSince $C_{\\text{out}} > C_{\\text{in}}$, the flux density $j$ is positive, correctly indicating a net flow from the outside to the inside. The units of $j$ depend on the units of $D$, $C$, and $L$. For SI units, if $C$ is in mol m$^{-3}$, $D$ is in m$^2$ s$^{-1}$, and $L$ is in m, then $j$ is in mol m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$.\n\nThe molar influx rate for a single pore, $J_{\\text{pore}}$ (moles per unit time), is the product of the flux density $j$ and the cross-sectional area of the pore, $A$. The assumption connecting the one-dimensional model to the three-dimensional geometry is that the concentration is uniform across any given cross-section of the pore.\n$$\nJ_{\\text{pore}} = j \\cdot A\n$$\nThe pore is a cylinder with diameter $d$, so its cross-sectional area is:\n$$\nA = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $j$ and $A$:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{pore}} = \\left( D \\frac{C_{\\text{out}} - C_{\\text{in}}}{L} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} \\right)\n$$\nThe total influx rate for the entire bacterium, $J_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the rates through all $N$ identical and non-interacting pores.\n$$\nJ_{\\text{total}} = N \\cdot J_{\\text{pore}}\n$$\nThus, the final derived expression for the total influx rate is:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{total}} = N D \\left( \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} \\right) \\frac{C_{\\text{out}} - C_{\\text{in}}}{L} = \\frac{\\pi N D d^2 (C_{\\text{out}} - C_{\\text{in}})}{4L}\n$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nFirst, all parameters must be in consistent SI units. The concentrations are given in mol L$^{-1}$ and must be converted to mol m$^{-3}$.\nThe conversion factor is $1 \\text{ L} = 10^{-3} \\text{ m}^3$, so $1 \\text{ mol L}^{-1} = 10^3 \\text{ mol m}^{-3}$.\n-   $C_{\\text{out}} = 10 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mol L}^{-1} = (10 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 10^3 \\text{ mol m}^{-3} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ mol m}^{-3}$\n-   $C_{\\text{in}} = 1 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mol L}^{-1} = (1 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 10^3 \\text{ mol m}^{-3} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mol m}^{-3}$\nThe concentration difference is $\\Delta C = C_{\\text{out}} - C_{\\text{in}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-2} - 0.1 \\times 10^{-2}) \\text{ mol m}^{-3} = 0.9 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ mol m}^{-3} = 9.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mol m}^{-3}$.\n\nThe other parameters in SI units are:\n-   $N = 1.5 \\times 10^{5}$\n-   $D = 2.0 \\times 10^{-10}$ m$^2$ s$^{-1}$\n-   $d = 1.2 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n-   $L = 5.0 \\times 10^{-9}$ m\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived expression for $J_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{\\pi (1.5 \\times 10^{5}) (2.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}^2 \\text{ s}^{-1}) (1.2 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m})^{2} (9.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mol m}^{-3})}{4 (5.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m})}\n$$\n$$\nJ_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{\\pi (1.5 \\times 10^{5}) (2.0 \\times 10^{-10}) (1.44 \\times 10^{-18}) (9.0 \\times 10^{-3})}{20 \\times 10^{-9}} \\text{ mol s}^{-1}\n$$\nLet's group the numerical coefficients and the powers of $10$:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{\\pi \\times 1.5 \\times 2.0 \\times 1.44 \\times 9.0}{20} \\times \\frac{10^{5} \\times 10^{-10} \\times 10^{-18} \\times 10^{-3}}{10^{-9}} \\text{ mol s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe coefficient is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi \\times 3.0 \\times 1.44 \\times 9.0}{20} = \\frac{38.88 \\pi}{20} = 1.944 \\pi\n$$\nThe exponent of $10$ is:\n$$\n(5 - 10 - 18 - 3) - (-9) = -26 + 9 = -17\n$$\nSo, the total influx rate is:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{total}} = 1.944 \\pi \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol s}^{-1}\n$$\nUsing the value of $\\pi \\approx 3.14159...$:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{total}} \\approx 1.944 \\times 3.14159 \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol s}^{-1} \\approx 6.1072776 \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol s}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{total}} \\approx 6.11 \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ mol s}^{-1}\n$$\n\n**Sensitivity Analysis**\n\nTo identify which parameters most strongly influence the total influx rate, we evaluate the logarithmic sensitivity, $S_P^{J_{\\text{total}}}$, for each parameter $P$. This quantity is defined as $S_P^{J_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{\\partial(\\ln J_{\\text{total}})}{\\partial(\\ln P)}$. For a function of the form $F = k \\cdot P_1^{a_1} P_2^{a_2} \\dots$, the sensitivity to parameter $P_i$ is simply its exponent, $a_i$.\n\nOur expression for the total influx is:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{total}} = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) N^1 D^1 d^2 L^{-1} (\\Delta C)^1\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln(J_{\\text{total}}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) + \\ln(N) + \\ln(D) + 2\\ln(d) - \\ln(L) + \\ln(\\Delta C)\n$$\nThe sensitivities are the exponents of each parameter in the expression for $J_{\\text{total}}$:\n-   Sensitivity to the number of pores, $N$: $S_N^{J_{\\text{total}}} = 1$. A $1\\%$ change in $N$ results in a $1\\%$ change in $J_{\\text{total}}$.\n-   Sensitivity to the diffusion coefficient, $D$: $S_D^{J_{\\text{total}}} = 1$. A $1\\%$ change in $D$ results in a $1\\%$ change in $J_{\\text{total}}$.\n-   Sensitivity to the pore diameter, $d$: $S_d^{J_{\\text{total}}} = 2$. A $1\\%$ change in $d$ results in a $2\\%$ change in $J_{\\text{total}}$.\n-   Sensitivity to the pore length, $L$: $S_L^{J_{\\text{total}}} = -1$. A $1\\%$ change in $L$ results in a $-1\\%$ change in $J_{\\text{total}}$.\n-   Sensitivity to the concentration difference, $\\Delta C$: $S_{\\Delta C}^{J_{\\text{total}}} = 1$. A $1\\%$ change in $\\Delta C$ results in a $1\\%$ change in $J_{\\text{total}}$.\n\nComparing the absolute values of these sensitivities, $|S_d^{J_{\\text{total}}}| = 2$ is the largest. Therefore, the total influx rate is most strongly influenced by the pore diameter, $d$. This is a direct consequence of the influx rate being proportional to the cross-sectional area, which depends on the square of the diameter ($A \\propto d^2$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{6.11 \\times 10^{-17}}\n$$", "id": "4685721"}]}
