Assume that over the interval of interest there is negligible cell death, no nutrient depletion, and no change in cell cycle regulation, so that each cell divides into exactly two daughter cells after every generation time and cell numbers add linearly across lineages.\n\nStarting only from the definition of binary fission with a fixed generation time and the interpretation of growth as successive, synchronous generations, derive an expression for the time $t$ required for the population size to increase by a factor $F$ relative to its initial size. Then, evaluate this time for $F = 10^{6}$ and a doubling time $\\tau_{d} = 30$ minutes, expressing the final time in hours. Round your numerical answer to four significant figures.

While carbon oxidation to $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ differs between respiration and fermentation, the dominant constraint here is ATP availability; with a much lower ATP yield per substrate, more substrate is consumed per unit biomass formed, reducing $Y_{x/s}$.

This problem presents a thought experiment where the division machinery is selectively inhibited, forcing you to deduce the resulting phenotype. By considering the distinct roles of the key cytoskeletal proteins FtsZ and MreB, you can predict how a single molecular intervention leads to a dramatic and specific change in cell shape [@problem_id:4628719].", "problem": "A rod-shaped Gram-negative bacterium growing in rich medium at steady state is abruptly exposed at time $t=0$ to a small-molecule that selectively inhibits polymerization of Filamenting temperature-sensitive protein Z (FtsZ) without affecting the actin homolog MreB or enzymes of the sidewall peptidoglycan (PG) synthetic machinery. Prior to treatment, the cells maintain a constant mean width $W_0$ and mean length $L_0$ with division occurring symmetrically at midcell, forming new poles via septal PG synthesis. After treatment, the elongation (sidewall) machinery continues to insert PG along the cylindrical sidewall at its pre-treatment rate, whereas septal PG synthesis is abolished because the divisome cannot assemble without an FtsZ ring.\n\nUse the following foundational facts and definitions:\n\n- The bacterial cell wall is expanded by insertion of peptidoglycan units and crosslinking. In rod-shaped bacteria, elongation is driven by the elongasome, a complex guided by MreB that directs distributed sidewall insertion, while division requires a Z-ring formed by FtsZ, which recruits the divisome to catalyze septal PG synthesis at midcell and generate new poles.\n- MreB dynamically localizes in bands or short filaments that track regions of defined curvature on the inner membrane and coordinates RodA–Penicillin-Binding Protein 2 (PBP2) and associated enzymes, thereby maintaining a preferred diameter through feedback between envelope mechanics and sidewall growth.\n- In the absence of an FtsZ ring, midcell constriction does not initiate, divisome components cannot function, and septal PG synthesis is not activated.\n- Under nutrient-rich conditions, biomass accumulation continues if envelope integrity is maintained; Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication initiation and segregation can proceed without cytokinesis, resulting in multiple nucleoids distributed along an elongating rod.\n\nAssume that, immediately after FtsZ inhibition, the sidewall elongation rate is unchanged. Let the cell’s cylindrical radius be $R_0 = W_0/2$ and the instantaneous length be $L(t)$ for $t>0$. The sidewall surface area is $S_{\\mathrm{side}}(t)=2\\pi R_0 L(t)$, and new poles are only generated by septation, which is absent when FtsZ polymerization is inhibited. If the rate of sidewall area increase is a constant $k_s$ per unit time, then $dS_{\\mathrm{side}}/dt = k_s$ implies $dL/dt = k_s/(2\\pi R_0)$ and $W(t)\\approx W_0$ because MreB-mediated width control remains intact.\n\nWhich of the following composite phenotypes is most consistent with these constraints after a short time interval $t>0$ that is long enough for measurable elongation but not so long that lysis or secondary stress responses dominate?\n\nA. Predominantly spherical cells with increased diameter and loss of rod-like width control; septal rings still form at midcell due to MreB compensation; frequent minicell production at the poles.\n\nB. Long, nonseptate filaments that maintain wild-type diameter; multiple segregated nucleoids aligned along the filament; absence of visible midcell constrictions; no generation of new poles until FtsZ function is restored.\n\nC. Shortened rods with multiple ectopic septa leading to chains of minicells; width unchanged; septal PG synthesis becomes hyperactivated through MreB-dependent recruitment in the absence of FtsZ.\n\nD. Branched or Y-shaped cells due to mislocalized sidewall insertion tracks; division proceeds at near-normal frequency but cell shape becomes aberrant because FtsZ inhibition is compensated by remodeling of MreB structures.", "solution": "The problem describes the selective inhibition of FtsZ, a protein essential for cell division, while leaving the MreB-dependent elongation machinery intact. We can deduce the resulting phenotype by considering the distinct roles of these cytoskeletal elements.\n\n1.  **Effect on Cell Division**: FtsZ polymerizes to form the Z-ring, which is the foundational scaffold for the divisome (the cell division machinery). The problem states that FtsZ polymerization is inhibited. Consequently, the Z-ring cannot form, the divisome cannot assemble, and septal peptidoglycan synthesis is abolished. This means cell division (cytokinesis) is completely blocked.\n\n2.  **Effect on Cell Elongation and Width**: The problem specifies that the MreB-guided elongation machinery remains fully functional. MreB directs the synthesis of the peptidoglycan sidewall, causing the cell to increase in length while maintaining a constant diameter. Therefore, the cell will continue to elongate at its normal rate, but its width will remain unchanged (approximately $W_0$).\n\n3.  **Overall Phenotype**: A cell that continues to elongate but cannot divide will necessarily become a long, thread-like filament. Since division is blocked, no new septa will form (the filament is nonseptate), and no new poles will be generated. As biomass and DNA continue to be synthesized, the elongated cell will contain multiple, segregated nucleoids distributed along its length.\n\nEvaluating the options based on this deduction:\n-   **A. Spherical cells**: This is incorrect. This phenotype results from MreB inhibition, but MreB is active.\n-   **B. Long, nonseptate filaments that maintain wild-type diameter; multiple segregated nucleoids...**: This perfectly matches the derived phenotype. Continuous elongation without division leads to filamentation, constant width is maintained by MreB, and DNA replication continues.\n-   **C. Shortened rods with multiple septa**: This is incorrect. Elongation continues, making the cells longer, and septation is blocked, not hyperactivated.\n-   **D. Branched cells with normal division**: This is incorrect. Branching suggests a defect in MreB-guided elongation, which is stated to be normal. Division is blocked, not proceeding.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent phenotype is the formation of long, nonseptate filaments with a constant wild-type diameter.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4628719"}]}
