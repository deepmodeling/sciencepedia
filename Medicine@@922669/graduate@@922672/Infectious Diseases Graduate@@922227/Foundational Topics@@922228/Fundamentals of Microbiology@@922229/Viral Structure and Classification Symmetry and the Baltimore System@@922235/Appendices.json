No rounding is needed.", "solution": "The solution is derived from the fundamental principles governing the construction of icosahedral viral capsids.\n\n1.  **Determination of the Triangulation Number ($T$)**\n    An icosahedron is a platonic solid defined by $20$ triangular faces, $30$ edges, and $12$ vertices. It possesses a high degree of rotational symmetry, described by the icosahedral point group, which has $60$ distinct rotational symmetry operations. These operations map an asymmetric unit onto $59$ other identical positions to form the complete icosahedron.\n\n    In the context of Caspar-Klug theory, a viral capsid is constructed from $60$ identical asymmetric units. The triangulation number, $T$, is defined as the number of protein subunits contained within each of these asymmetric units. Therefore, the total number of protein subunits, $N$, in the entire capsid is given by the product of the number of asymmetric units and the number of subunits per unit:\n    $$N = 60 \\times T$$\n    The problem states that the total number of subunits is $N=720$. We can use this information to solve for $T$:\n    $$720 = 60 T$$\n    $$T = \\frac{720}{60} = 12$$\n    Thus, the triangulation number is $T=12$.\n\n2.  **Determination of the Number of Pentameric Capsomers**\n    Euler's theorem for polyhedra states that for any simple polyhedron with $V$ vertices, $E$ edges, and $F$ faces, $V - E + F = 2$. For a closed shell constructed from pentagons and hexagons (which correspond to pentameric and hexameric capsomers), a direct topological consequence of this theorem is that exactly $12$ pentagons are required to achieve closure.\n\n    In an icosahedral virus capsid, the $12$ vertices of the underlying icosahedron are positions of $5$-fold rotational symmetry. These positions must be occupied by pentameric capsomers. Therefore, for any icosahedral capsid described by the Caspar-Klug theory (with $T \\ge 1$), the number of pentameric capsomers is invariably $12$.\n    $$N_{\\text{pentamers}} = 12$$\n\n3.  **Determination of the Number of Hexameric Capsomers**\n    The total number of subunits, $N=720$, are organized into pentamers and hexamers. We have already established that there are $12$ pentamers. The number of subunits that constitute these pentamers is:\n    $$N_{\\text{subunits in pentamers}} = 12 \\times 5 = 60$$\n    The remaining subunits must form hexameric capsomers. The number of subunits available for hexamers is:\n    $$N_{\\text{subunits in hexamers}} = N - N_{\\text{subunits in pentamers}} = 720 - 60 = 660$$\n    Since each hexameric capsomer is composed of $6$ subunits, the number of hexamers is:\n    $$N_{\\text{hexamers}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{subunits in hexamers}}}{6} = \\frac{660}{6} = 110$$\n    Alternatively, a general formula for the number of hexamers in a capsid with triangulation number $T$ is given by $10(T-1)$. Using our calculated value of $T=12$:\n    $$N_{\\text{hexamers}} = 10(12-1) = 10 \\times 11 = 110$$\n    This confirms our result.\n\n4.  **Requirement of Quasi-Equivalence**\n    **Strict equivalence** describes a situation where all subunits in a structure are in geometrically identical environments. For an icosahedral capsid, this is only possible if the capsid is composed of exactly $60$ subunits, corresponding to a triangulation number of $T=1$. In a $T=1$ capsid, the $60$ subunits assemble into $12$ pentamers, and there are no hexamers. Each of the $60$ subunits is related to every other subunit by one of the icosahedral symmetry operations.\n\n    **Quasi-equivalence** is a principle invoked to explain how capsids with more than $60$ subunits can be built from identical protein monomers. When $T > 1$, the subunits cannot all occupy strictly equivalent positions. For example, a subunit may be part of a pentamer or a hexamer, which are different local environments. Furthermore, even within the set of hexamers, subunits may occupy different positions relative to the global symmetry axes of the icosahedron. These slightly different, non-identical environments are termed quasi-equivalent.\n\n    In this problem, we found that $T=12$. Since $T > 1$, the capsid is composed of $720$ subunits, which is far greater than the $60$ allowed for strict equivalence. Therefore, the subunits must occupy quasi-equivalent positions to form the closed capsid. The existence of both pentamers and hexamers is a direct consequence of this. Thus, quasi-equivalence is required. This corresponds to a value of $q=1$.\n\nThe final results are: $T=12$, $N_{\\text{pentamers}}=12$, $N_{\\text{hexamers}}=110$, and $q=1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n12 & 12 & 110 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4706456"}, {"introduction": "A viral capsid is more than just a protective shell; for many viruses, it is a high-pressure vessel that stores the enormous energy required for genome ejection.
