Consider a single-compartment thermoregulatory model grounded in energy conservation and linear negative feedback: the body is a well-mixed thermal mass with heat capacity $C$, and thermoregulatory effectors implement proportional control that generates a net heat loss power proportional to the error $e = T_{\\text{core}} - T_{\\text{set}}$ with proportionality constant $\\alpha$. Assume the following foundational facts:\n1) In a local linearization around a steady operating point with all non-thermoregulatory heat fluxes balanced and unchanged, energy balance implies that changes in core temperature $T_{\\text{core}}$ are driven by the effector power alone.\n2) Antipyretic ibuprofen lowers the hypothalamic set-point $T_{\\text{set}}$ by $1\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ when fever is mediated by PGE2, but does not alter $T_{\\text{set}}$ in EHS.\n3) Ibuprofen has no direct effect on heat production, environmental heat exchange parameters, or the feedback gain $\\alpha$.\n\nAt time $t=0$, ibuprofen is administered.

The body is modeled as a single compartment with heat capacity $C$. The principle of energy conservation states that the rate of change of the body's internal energy, $U$, equals the net power, $P_{\\text{net}}$, supplied to it. The internal energy is given by $U = C T_{\\text{core}}$. Therefore, its rate of change is $\\frac{dU}{dt} = C \\frac{dT_{\\text{core}}}{dt}$.\n\nThe problemi specifies that the thermoregulatory effector response generates a net heat loss power, $P_{\\text{loss}}$, proportional to the error $e = T_{\\text{core}} - T_{\\text{set}}$. The proportionality constant is the feedback gain $\\alpha$.\n$$P_{\\text{loss}} = \\alpha (T_{\\text{core}} - T_{\\text{set}})$$\nThis represents power leaving the system. The net power input to the system due to this regulatory action is thus $P_{\\text{reg}} = -P_{\\text{loss}}$.\n$$P_{\\text{reg}} = -\\alpha (T_{\\text{core}} - T_{\\text{set}})$$\nThe problem states that \"changes in core temperature $T_{\\text{core}}$ are driven by the effector power alone,\" which implies we consider only this power term in the energy balance for temperature *changes*. Equating the rate of change of internal energy with this net power yields the governing equation:\n$$C \\frac{dT_{\\text{core}}}{dt} = -\\alpha (T_{\\text{core}} - T_{\\text{set}})$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. It can be rewritten in standard form as:\n$$\\frac{dT_{\\text{core}}}{dt} + \\frac{\\alpha}{C} T_{\\text{core}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{C} T_{\\text{set}}$$\nThis is the required governing equation for $T_{\\text{core}}(t)$.\n\nNext, we solve this equation for the fever scenario. Ibuprofen is administered at $t=0$.\nThe initial condition at $t=0^{-}$ is a steady state where the core temperature equals the elevated set-point, $T_{\\text{core}}(0^{-}) = T_{\\text{set,old}}$.

The particular solution is the new steady-state temperature, $T_{\\text{core}} = T_{\\text{set,new}}$. The homogeneous equation, $\\frac{dT_{h}}{dt} + \\frac{\\alpha}{C} T_{h} = 0$, has the solution $T_{h}(t) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{C}t\\right)$, where $A$ is a constant of integration.\nThe full solution is:\n$$T_{\\text{core}}(t) = T_{\\text{set,new}} + A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{C}t\\right)$$\nWe determine $A$ using the initial condition $T_{\\text{core}}(0) = T_{\\text{set,old}}$:\n$$T_{\\text{set,old}} = T_{\\text{set,new}} + A \\exp(0) \\implies A = T_{\\text{set,old}} - T_{\\text{set,new}}$$\nSo, the temperature evolution in the febrile patient is:\n$$T_{\\text{core,fever}}(t) = T_{\\text{set,new}} + (T_{\\text{set,old}} - T_{\\text{set,new}}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{C}t\\right)$$\nThe core temperature reduction attributable to ibuprofen is defined as $\\Delta T_{\\text{reduction}}(t) = T_{\\text{core}}(0) - T_{\\text{core}}(t)$.
