Consider a single mosquito bite that occurs after the mosquito has fed on an infected bird. Assume the following biologically grounded chain for the delivered dose: the mosquito acquires virions from the bird’s bloodmeal; some fraction of these virions survive within the vector until the next bite; a fraction of the surviving virions are inoculated into the human dermis at the moment of biting. Let the expected number of virions delivered to the human (the dose) be denoted by $D$.\n\nStart from the following foundational assumptions, which are widely used in quantitative microbial risk assessment and vector-borne transmission modeling:\n- The count of virions acquired during blood feeding and the subsequent count inoculated into the human are well-approximated by Poisson processes due to stochastic partitioning at microscale and independence of individual virions.\n- Infection follows a “single-hit” mechanism: each inoculated virion independently has a constant probability to initiate infection upon arrival, and infection occurs if at least one virion successfully initiates infection.\n\nUsing these assumptions, derive the functional form for the probability of infection in terms of a per-virion infectivity parameter $k$ and the expected dose $D$.

The underlying assumptions—Poisson statistics for virion counts and an independent single-hit mechanism for infection—are standard and rigorously defined models in quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) and virology. All necessary parameters are provided with plausible values, and the required calculations are clearly specified. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe solution process consists of two main parts: first, deriving the general functional form for the probability of infection based on the given assumptions, and second, calculating a specific numerical value for this probability using the provided parameters.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Infection Probability Model**\n\nLet $N$ be the random variable representing the number of virions inoculated into the human during the mosquito bite. The problem states that $N$ can be modeled as a Poisson process. The expected number of inoculated virions is the dose, denoted by $D$. Therefore, $N$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $D$. The probability mass function (PMF) of $N$ is given by:\n$$\nP(N=n) = \\frac{D^n \\exp(-D)}{n!} \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\n$$\n\nThe problem assumes a \"single-hit\" infection mechanism. This implies that each of the $n$ inoculated virions acts independently to cause infection. Let $k$ be the probability that a single virion successfully initiates an infection. The probability that a single virion *fails* to initiate an infection is therefore $(1-k)$.\n\nGiven that $N=n$ virions have been inoculated, the probability that *none* of them initiate an infection is the product of their individual probabilities of failure, due to their independence. This probability is $(1-k)^n$. Infection occurs if at least one virion is successful. Thus, the probability of infection, conditional on $n$ virions being inoculated, is:\n$$\nP(\\text{Infection} | N=n) = 1 - P(\\text{No Infection} | N=n) = 1 - (1-k)^n\n$$\nThis formula holds for any $n \\ge 0$. If $n=0$, $P(\\text{Infection} | N=0) = 1 - (1-k)^0 = 1 - 1 = 0$, which is correct.\n\nTo find the total probability of infection, $P(\\text{Inf})$, we must sum the conditional probabilities over all possible values of $n$, weighted by the probability of each $n$ occurring. This is an application of the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(\\text{Inf}) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} P(\\text{Infection} | N=n) P(N=n)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the conditional probability and the PMF of $N$:\n$$\nP(\\text{Inf}) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} [1 - (1-k)^n] \\frac{D^n \\exp(-D)}{n!}\n$$\nWe can separate the summation into two parts:\n$$\nP(\\text{Inf}) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{D^n \\exp(-D)}{n!} - \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (1-k)^n \\frac{D^n \\exp(-D)}{n!}\n$$\nThe first term is the sum of all probabilities in a Poisson distribution with mean $D$, which is equal to $1$:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{D^n \\exp(-D)}{n!} = \\exp(-D) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{D^n}{n!} = \\exp(-D) \\exp(D) = 1\n$$\nFor the second term, we can factor out $\\exp(-D)$ and combine the powers of $n$:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (1-k)^n \\frac{D^n \\exp(-D)}{n!} = \\exp(-D) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{[D(1-k)]^n}{n!}\n$$\nThe summation is the Taylor series expansion for the exponential function $\\exp(x)$ with $x=D(1-k)$. Therefore, the second term simplifies to:\n$$\n\\exp(-D) \\exp[D(1-k)] = \\exp[-D + D(1-k)] = \\exp(-D + D - Dk) = \\exp(-kD)\n$$\nCombining the two simplified terms, we arrive at the functional form for the probability of infection, which is the well-known exponential dose-response model:\n$$\nP(\\text{Inf}) = 1 - \\exp(-kD)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Specific Infection Probability**\n\nFirst, we must calculate the expected dose, $D$, using the provided parameters and formula: $D = C_{r} \\times V_{m} \\times \\alpha \\times s \\times \\beta$.\nThe parameters are:\n- Reservoir viremia: $C_{r} = 2.0 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\text{virions/mL}$\n- Mosquito bloodmeal volume: $V_{m} = 3.5 \\, \\mu\\text{L}$\n- Acquisition efficiency: $\\alpha = 0.15$\n- In-vector survival: $s = 0.50$\n- Inoculation efficiency: $\\beta = 0.25$\n\nWe must first ensure the units are consistent.

If it survives, it becomes infectious for its remaining lifespan, which is on average $1/\\mu$ days. During this time, it bites at a rate of $a$, delivering a total of $a/\\mu$ bites. A fraction $f_i$ of these bites land on host species $i$, and each bite has a probability $b_i$ of causing an infection. Thus, one infectious vector produces a total of $\\frac{a f_i b_i}{\\mu}$ new infections in host species $i$.\n\nCombining these steps, the number of secondary infections in host species $i$ produced by one primary infection in host species $j$ is:\n$$ K_{ij} = \\left( \\frac{a N_v f_j c_j}{N_j r_j} \\right) \\times \\exp(-\\mu n) \\times \\left( \\frac{a f_i b_i}{\\mu} \\right) $$\n$$ K_{ij} = \\frac{a^2 N_v \\exp(-\\mu n)}{\\mu} \\frac{f_i b_i f_j c_j}{N_j r_j} $$\nThis matrix has the form of an outer product $K = \\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{v}^T$, where the vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ have elements:\n$$ u_i = f_i b_i \\quad \\text{and} \\quad v_j = \\frac{a^2 N_v \\exp(-\\mu n)}{\\mu} \\frac{f_j c_j}{N_j r_j} $$\nThe spectral radius of such a rank-one matrix is given by the inner product $\\mathbf{v}^T \\mathbf{u} = \\sum_k v_k u_k$. Therefore, $R_0$ is:\n$$ R_0 = \\rho(K) = \\sum_{k} v_k u_k = \\sum_{k} \\left( \\frac{a^2 N_v \\exp(-\\mu n)}{\\mu} \\frac{f_k c_k}{N_k r_k} \\right) (f_k b_k) $$\n$$ R_0 = \\frac{a^2 N_v \\exp(-\\mu n)}{\\mu} \\sum_k \\frac{f_k^2 b_k c_k}{N_k r_k} $$\nLet's first calculate the constant pre-factor:\n$$ P = \\frac{a^2 N_v \\exp(-\\mu n)}{\\mu} = \\frac{(0.5)^2 (1.0 \\times 10^{5}) \\exp(-(0.1)(10))}{0.1} = \\frac{0.25 \\times 10^5 \\exp(-1)}{0.1} = 2.5 \\times 10^5 \\exp(-1) $$\n\n**Calculation of $R_0^{\\text{before}}$**\nFor the two-host system ($k \\in \\{1, 2\\}$):\nThe denominator for the biting fractions is $\\sum_{k=1}^2 w_k N_k = (1.0)(2.0 \\times 10^5) + (0.5)(1.0 \\times 10^5) = 2.5 \\times 10^5$.\nThe biting fractions are:\n$$ f_1 = \\frac{1.0 \\times 2.0 \\times 10^5}{2.5 \\times 10^5} = 0.8 $$\n$$ f_2 = \\frac{0.5 \\times 1.0 \\times 10^5}{2.5 \\times 10^5} = 0.2 $$\nNow we compute the sum:\n$$ S_{\\text{before}} = \\frac{f_1^2 b_1 c_1}{N_1 r_1} + \\frac{f_2^2 b_2 c_2}{N_2 r_2} $$\n$$ S_{\\text{before}} = \\frac{(0.8)^2 (0.2) (0.05)}{(2.0 \\times 10^5)(0.1)} + \\frac{(0.2)^2 (0.3) (0.1)}{(1.0 \\times 10^5)(0.2)} $$\n$$ S_{\\text{before}} = \\frac{0.64 \\times 0.01}{2.0 \\times 10^4} + \\frac{0.04 \\times 0.03}{2.0 \\times 10^4} = \\frac{0.0064}{20000} + \\frac{0.0012}{20000} $$\n$$ S_{\\text{before}} = 3.2 \\times 10^{-7} + 0.6 \\times 10^{-7} = 3.8 \\times 10^{-7} $$\nSo, $R_0^{\\text{before}}$ is:\n$$ R_0^{\\text{before}} = P \\times S_{\\text{before}} = (2.5 \\times 10^5 \\exp(-1)) \\times (3.8 \\times 10^{-7}) = 9.5 \\times 10^{-2} \\exp(-1) = 0.095 \\exp(-1) $$\n\n**Calculation of $R_0^{\\text{after}}$**\nFor the three-host system ($k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$), we introduce host $H_3$.\nThe new denominator for the biting fractions is $\\sum_{k=1}^3 w_k N_k = (2.5 \\times 10^5) + (5.0)(2.0 \\times 10^4) = 2.5 \\times 10^5 + 1.0 \\times 10^5 = 3.5 \\times 10^5$.\nThe new biting fractions are:\n$$ f_1 = \\frac{1.0 \\times 2.0 \\times 10^5}{3.5 \\times 10^5} = \\frac{2.0}{3.5} = \\frac{4}{7} $$\n$$ f_2 = \\frac{0.5 \\times 1.0 \\times 10^5}{3.5 \\times 10^5} = \\frac{0.5}{3.5} = \\frac{1}{7} $$\n$$ f_3 = \\frac{5.0 \\times 2.0 \\times 10^4}{3.5 \\times 10^5} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^5}{3.5 \\times 10^5} = \\frac{1.0}{3.5} = \\frac{2}{7} $$\nNow we compute the new sum:\n$$ S_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{f_1^2 b_1 c_1}{N_1 r_1} + \\frac{f_2^2 b_2 c_2}{N_2 r_2} + \\frac{f_3^2 b_3 c_3}{N_3 r_3} $$\n$$ S_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{(4/7)^2 (0.2)(0.05)}{(2.0 \\times 10^5)(0.1)} + \\frac{(1/7)^2 (0.3)(0.1)}{(1.0 \\times 10^5)(0.2)} + \\frac{(2/7)^2 (0.7)(0.9)}{(2.0 \\times 10^4)(0.05)} $$\n$$ S_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{16/49 \\times 0.01}{2.0 \\times 10^4} + \\frac{1/49 \\times 0.03}{2.0 \\times 10^4} + \\frac{4/49 \\times 0.63}{1.0 \\times 10^3} $$\n$$ S_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{16}{49} \\frac{10^{-2}}{2 \\times 10^4} + \\frac{1}{49} \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-2}}{2 \\times 10^4} + \\frac{4}{49} \\frac{6.3 \\times 10^{-1}}{10^3} $$\n$$ S_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{8}{49} \\times 10^{-6} + \\frac{1.5}{49} \\times 10^{-6} + \\frac{2.52}{49} \\times 10^{-3} = \\frac{1}{49} \\left( 8 \\times 10^{-6} + 1.5 \\times 10^{-6} + 2520 \\times 10^{-6} \\right) $$\n$$ S_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{2529.5}{49} \\times 10^{-6} \\approx 51.6224489... \\times 10^{-6} $$\nSo, $R_0^{\\text{after}}$ is:\n$$ R_0^{\\text{after}} = P \\times S_{\\text{after}} = (2.5 \\times 10^5 \\exp(-1)) \\times (5.16224489... \\times 10^{-5}) $$\n$$ R_0^{\\text{after}} = (2.5 \\times 5.16224489...) \\exp(-1) = 12.905612... \\exp(-1) $$\n\n**Calculation of $\\Delta R_0$**\nThe change in the basic reproduction number is:\n$$ \\Delta R_0 = R_0^{\\text{after}} - R_0^{\\text{before}} $$\n$$ \\Delta R_0 = 12.905612... \\exp(-1) - 0.095 \\exp(-1) $$\n$$ \\Delta R_0 = (12.905612... - 0.095) \\exp(-1) = 12.810612... \\exp(-1) $$\n$$ \\Delta R_0 \\approx \\frac{12.810612...}{2.7182818...} \\approx 4.712780... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $4.713$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.713}$$", "id": "4686788"}]}
