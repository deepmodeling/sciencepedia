In this model, define the survival fraction of bioactivity as $S(t) = A(t)/A_{0}$, where $A(t)$ is activity at time $t$ and $A_{0}$ is the initial activity. The decimal reduction time (D-value) at temperature $T$, denoted $D_{T}$, is the time required to produce a one-order-of-magnitude reduction in activity, that is $S(D_{T}) = 10^{-1}$.
