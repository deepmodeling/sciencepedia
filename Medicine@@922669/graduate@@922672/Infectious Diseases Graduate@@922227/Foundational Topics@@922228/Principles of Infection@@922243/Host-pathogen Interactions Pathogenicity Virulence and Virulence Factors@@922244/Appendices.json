The parameters $\\gamma$ and $\\mu_{D}$ represent decay and resolution rates, respectively, and are therefore positive, so $\\lambda_2 < 0$ and $\\lambda_3 < 0$. The stability of the pathogen-free state thus depends solely on the sign of $\\lambda_1$.\n\nThe condition for pathogen clearance is $\\lambda_1 < 0$:\n$$ r - \\mu_{P} - \\eta \\frac{\\sigma}{\\gamma} < 0 $$\nThis inequality specifies the requirement on the immune killing efficacy $\\eta$ to ensure clearance. The minimal or critical efficacy, $\\eta_c$, is the value of $\\eta$ for which $\\lambda_1 = 0$, representing the boundary between pathogen growth and clearance.\n$$ r - \\mu_{P} - \\eta_c \\frac{\\sigma}{\\gamma} = 0 $$\nSolving for $\\eta_c$:\n$$ \\eta_c \\frac{\\sigma}{\\gamma} = r - \\mu_{P} $$\n$$ \\eta_c = \\frac{\\gamma(r - \\mu_{P})}{\\sigma} $$\nThis expression represents the minimum immune killing efficacy required for the basal immune response to control the initial growth of the pathogen. For an infection that can establish, we assume the intrinsic growth rate $r$ is greater than the baseline clearance rate $\\mu_P$, making $r - \\mu_P > 0$ and consequently $\\eta_c > 0$. The parameters $K, \\phi, h, \\theta, \\xi, \\mu_D$, and $\\kappa$ do not influence the local stability at the pathogen-free state as their effects are of higher order in $P$ or operate in uncoupled subsystems in the linearized dynamics.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\gamma(r - \\mu_{P})}{\\sigma}}$$", "id": "4650641"}]}
