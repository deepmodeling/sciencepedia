It is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution will now be derived from first principles.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Infection Probability $P$\n\nThe derivation begins by modeling the concentration of infectious quanta in the seminar room air. Under the specified steady-state, well-mixed conditions, the concentration of quanta is constant over time. This steady state is achieved when the rate of quanta generation equals the rate of quanta removal.\n\nThe total rate of quanta generation, $G$, from $I$ infectious individuals each emitting at a rate $q$ is:\n$$G = Iq$$\nThe units are $\\text{quanta}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$.\n\nThe rate of quanta removal, $R$, is due to ventilation. In a well-mixed room with a uniform concentration of quanta, $C$ (in $\\text{quanta}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$), the removal rate is the product of this concentration and the outdoor air ventilation flow rate, $Q$:\n$$R = CQ$$\nThe units are $(\\text{quanta}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}) \\times (\\text{m}^{3}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}) = \\text{quanta}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$.\n\nAt steady state, the generation rate must equal the removal rate, $G=R$:\n$$Iq = CQ$$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration $C$ yields:\n$$C = \\frac{Iq}{Q}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of quanta inhaled by the susceptible person. This quantity, known as the dose $D$, is the product of the concentration of quanta in the air, the person's breathing rate $p$, and the duration of exposure $t$:\n$$D = C \\times p \\times t$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C$:\n$$D = \\left(\\frac{Iq}{Q}\\right)pt = \\frac{Iqpt}{Q}$$\nThis expression represents the mean number of quanta inhaled by the susceptible person during the exposure time $t$. The quantity $D$ is dimensionless.\n\nThe problem states that infection follows a Poisson process. Let $N$ be the random variable representing the number of quanta inhaled. $N$ follows a Poisson distribution with a mean equal to the expected dose, $\\lambda = D$. The probability of inhaling exactly $k$ quanta is given by:\n$$P(N=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!} = \\frac{D^k \\exp(-D)}{k!}$$\nInfection is defined as occurring if at least one quantum is inhaled, i.e., if $N \\ge 1$. The probability of this event, $P$, is complementary to the probability of inhaling zero quanta, $N=0$:\n$$P = P(N \\ge 1) = 1 - P(N=0)$$\nThe probability of inhaling zero quanta is:\n$$P(N=0) = \\frac{D^0 \\exp(-D)}{0!} = \\exp(-D)$$\n(recalling that $0!=1$ and $D^0=1$).\n\nTherefore, the infection probability $P$ is:\n$$P = 1 - \\exp(-D)$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for the dose $D$, we obtain the final expression for the infection probability as a function of the given parameters:\n$$P(I, q, p, t, Q) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Iqpt}{Q}\\right)$$\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Evaluation of $P$\n\nUsing the baseline scenario values:\n- $I = 1$\n- $q = 50\\,\\text{quanta}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$\n- $p = 0.6\\,\\text{m}^{3}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$\n- $t = 2\\,\\text{h}$\n- $Q = 300\\,\\text{m}^{3}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dose $D$:\n$$D = \\frac{Iqpt}{Q} = \\frac{(1)(50)(0.6)(2)}{300} = \\frac{60}{300} = 0.2$$\nNow, we calculate the infection probability $P$:\n$$P = 1 - \\exp(-D) = 1 - \\exp(-0.2)$$\nNumerically:\n$$P \\approx 1 - 0.81873075... = 0.18126924...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$P \\approx 0.1813$$\n\n### Part 3: Sensitivity Analysis\n\nTo interpret how $P$ responds to small changes in each parameter, we first determine the direction of change by examining the sign of the partial derivatives. Then, we use the dimensionless local elasticity to compare the relative influence. The elasticity of $P$ with respect to a parameter $x$ is defined as $E_x(P) = \\frac{x}{P} \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x}$.\n\nLet $D = \\frac{Iqpt}{Q}$. Then $P = 1 - \\exp(-D)$.\nThe partial derivative of $P$ with respect to any parameter $x$ is found using the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x} = \\frac{d P}{d D} \\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial x} = \\exp(-D) \\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial x}$$\n\n**Qualitative Interpretation (Direction of Change):**\n\n1.  **With respect to $I$**: $\\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial I} = \\frac{qpt}{Q}  0$. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial I}  0$. $P$ increases as $I$ increases.\n2.  **With respect to $q$**: $\\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial q} = \\frac{Ipt}{Q}  0$. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial q}  0$. $P$ increases as $q$ increases.\n3.  **With respect to $p$**: $\\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial p} = \\frac{Iqt}{Q}  0$. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial p}  0$. $P$ increases as $p$ increases.\n4.  **With respect to $t$**: $\\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial t} = \\frac{Iqp}{Q}  0$. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial t}  0$. $P$ increases as $t$ increases.\n5.  **With respect to $Q$**: $\\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial Q} = -\\frac{Iqpt}{Q^2}  0$. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial Q}  0$. $P$ decreases as $Q$ increases.\n\nThese results are physically intuitive: increasing the number of sources ($I$), their emission strength ($q$), the susceptible's inhalation rate ($p$), or the exposure duration ($t$) all increase infection probability. Conversely, increasing the removal rate via ventilation ($Q$) decreases the probability.\n\n**Quantitative Comparison (Elasticity):**\n\nLet's compute the elasticity for each parameter.\nFor any parameter $x \\in \\{I, q, p, t\\}$, which appear linearly in the numerator of $D$, we can write $\\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial x} = \\frac{D}{x}$.\nThe elasticity for these parameters is:\n$$E_x(P) = \\frac{x}{P} \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x} = \\frac{x}{1 - \\exp(-D)} \\left( \\exp(-D) \\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial x} \\right) = \\frac{x}{1 - \\exp(-D)} \\left( \\exp(-D) \\frac{D}{x} \\right) = \\frac{D \\exp(-D)}{1 - \\exp(-D)}$$\nFor the parameter $Q$, which appears in the denominator of $D$, we have $\\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial Q} = -\\frac{D}{Q}$.\nThe elasticity for $Q$ is:\n$$E_Q(P) = \\frac{Q}{P} \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial Q} = \\frac{Q}{1 - \\exp(-D)} \\left( \\exp(-D) \\frac{\\partial D}{\\partial Q} \\right) = \\frac{Q}{1 - \\exp(-D)} \\left( \\exp(-D) \\left(-\\frac{D}{Q}\\right) \\right) = -\\frac{D \\exp(-D)}{1 - \\exp(-D)}$$\n\nA notable result is that the magnitudes of the elasticities for all five parameters are identical:\n$$|E_I(P)| = |E_q(P)| = |E_p(P)| = |E_t(P)| = |E_Q(P)| = \\frac{D \\exp(-D)}{1 - \\exp(-D)}$$\n\nThis means that, at the baseline point, a small percentage change (e.g., $1\\%$) in any of the parameters ($I, q, p, t,$ or $Q$) will have the same relative magnitude of impact on the infection probability $P$.\n\nLet's calculate this common elasticity value at the baseline where $D=0.2$:\n$$E = \\frac{0.2 \\exp(-0.2)}{1 - \\exp(-0.2)} \\approx \\frac{0.2 \\times 0.81873}{0.18127} \\approx \\frac{0.16375}{0.18127} \\approx 0.9033$$\n\n**Interpretation:**\nAt the specified baseline conditions, the infection probability $P$ responds to small changes in any of the input parameters with the same relative sensitivity. Specifically, a $1\\%$ increase in the number of infectors ($I$), emission rate ($q$), breathing rate ($p$), or exposure time ($t$) each results in approximately a $0.9033\\%$ increase in the infection probability. A $1\\%$ increase in the ventilation rate ($Q$) results in approximately a $0.9033\\%$ decrease in the infection probability.

Assume the initial air is free of infectious quanta at $t = 0$, the emission $q$ is constant in time, and the susceptible individual resides entirely within either the near-field or the far-field zone for the entire exposure.\n\nFormulate the two-zone mass balance and, under the condition that the exposure duration $T$ is sufficiently long for both zones to reach steady state, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the ratio of infection risks between a susceptible resident in the near-field and a susceptible resident in the far-field as a function of $q$, $p$, $T$, $d$, $\\alpha$, $\\gamma$, $\\lambda_{n}$, $\\lambda_{f}$, and $V$. Your final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression for the ratio $R_{n}/R_{f}$, expressed without units. No numerical evaluation is required; do not round.", "solution": "The derivation begins from two core bases: conservation of mass for airborne infectious quanta and the infection probability representation from the Wells-Riley framework. Conservation of mass at the zone scale gives coupled linear ordinary differential equations for the concentrations $C_{n}(t)$ in the near-field and $C_{f}(t)$ in the far-field. The Wells-Riley framework provides that the infection risk $R$ in a zone is $R = 1 - \\exp(-D)$, where $D$ is the inhaled dose $D = p \\int_{0}^{T} C(t) \\, dt$.\n\nWe define the model parameters:\n- Source emission rate $q$ (quanta per unit time),\n- Near-field volume $V_{n}(d) = \\alpha d^{3}$,\n- Far-field volume $V_{f}(d) = V - \\alpha d^{3}$,\n- Interzonal volumetric exchange $m(d) = \\gamma d^{2}$,\n- Effective loss rates $\\lambda_{n}$ and $\\lambda_{f}$ (per unit time),\n- Breathing rate $p$ (volume per unit time),\n- Exposure duration $T$ (time).\n\nThe near-field mass balance (rate of change of $C_{n}$) is driven by the source and losses within near-field, plus exchange with the far-field. The far-field balance includes exchange from the near-field and its own losses.
