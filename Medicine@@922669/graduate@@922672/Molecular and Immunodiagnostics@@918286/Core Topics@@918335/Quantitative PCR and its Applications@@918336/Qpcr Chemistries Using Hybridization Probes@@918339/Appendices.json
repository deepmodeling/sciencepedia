The validation process confirms that the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The provided thermodynamic parameters and concentrations, while resulting in a practically low melting temperature for a typical qPCR application, are not physically impossible and do not invalidate the problem itself. The calculation is a valid exercise in applying thermodynamic principles to nucleic acid duplex stability.\n\nThe derivation begins with the fundamental principles of chemical thermodynamics. The formation of the probe-target duplex ($D$) from the single-stranded probe ($P$) and its target ($T$) is a reversible bimolecular reaction:\n$$ P + T \\rightleftharpoons D $$\nThe equilibrium constant, $K$, for this reaction is given by the ratio of the molar concentration of the product to the product of the molar concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium:\n$$ K = \\frac{[D]}{[P][T]} $$\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, is related to the standard enthalpy change, $\\Delta H^{\\circ}$, and the standard entropy change, $\\Delta S^{\\circ}$, by the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ}(T) = \\Delta H^{\\circ} - T\\Delta S^{\\circ} $$\nFurthermore, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ is related to the equilibrium constant $K$ at temperature $T$:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ}(T) = -R\\,T\\ln K $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant.\n\nThe melting temperature, $T_m$, is defined as the temperature at which half of the probe molecules are in the duplex form. For a non-self-complementary duplex with equimolar initial concentrations of probe and target, this condition implies that the concentrations of the free single strands are equal to the concentration of the duplex. The problem provides a specific definition: the effective duplex concentration at the melting point is $C$. That is, at $T = T_m$, $[D] = C$. For the non-self-complementary case, at $T_m$, we have $[P] = [T] = [D]$. Therefore, at the melting temperature, $[P] = [T] = [D] = C$.\n\nSubstituting these concentrations into the expression for the equilibrium constant at $T_m$, denoted as $K_m$:\n$$ K_m = \\frac{C}{C \\cdot C} = \\frac{1}{C} $$\nNow, we can derive the expression for $T_m$.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe excited state of a donor fluorophore (D) can decay through several pathways. In the absence of an acceptor (A), the excited donor, $D^*$, decays via fluorescence (radiative process) with a rate constant $k_F$ and via other non-radiative processes (e.g., internal conversion, intersystem crossing) with a combined rate constant $k_{NR}$. The total decay rate for the donor alone is the sum of these rates, and the fluorescence lifetime of the donor alone, $\\tau_D$, is the inverse of this total rate:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_D} = k_F + k_{NR}\n$$\n\nWhen an acceptor is in proximity, an additional non-radiative decay pathway is introduced: Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to the acceptor, with a rate constant $k_T$. The total decay rate for the donor in the presence of the acceptor is then:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{DA}} = k_F + k_{NR} + k_T\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_{DA}$ is the donor lifetime in the presence of the acceptor.\n\nThe efficiency of energy transfer, $E$, is defined as the fraction of donor de-excitations that occur via FRET. It is the ratio of the FRET rate to the total decay rate of the donor in the presence of the acceptor:\n$$\nE = \\frac{k_T}{k_F + k_{NR} + k_T}\n$$\nWe can substitute the expression for $\\tau_D$ into this equation:\n$$\nE = \\frac{k_T}{1/\\tau_D + k_T}\n$$\nAccording to Förster's theory, the rate of energy transfer $k_T$ is related to the donor-acceptor separation distance $r$ by:\n$$\nk_T = \\frac{1}{\\tau_D} \\left( \\frac{R_0}{r} \\right)^6\n$$\nwhere $R_0$ is the Förster radius, the critical distance at which the energy transfer efficiency is $50\\%$. The assumption of an isotropic orientation factor is implicitly incorporated into the empirical value of $R_0$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $k_T$ into the equation for efficiency $E$:\n$$\nE = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\tau_D} \\left( \\frac{R_0}{r} \\right)^6}{\\frac{1}{\\tau_D} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_D} \\left( \\frac{R_0}{r} \\right)^6}\n$$\nThe term $1/\\tau_D$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding the energy transfer efficiency as a function of $r$ and $R_0$:\n$$\nE = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{R_0}{r} \\right)^6}{1 + \\left( \\frac{R_0}{r} \\right)^6}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten in a more common form:\n$$\nE = \\frac{R_0^6}{r^6 + R_0^6}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nThe second part is to compute the residual background fluorescence fraction of the intact probe relative to the fully cleaved probe. The fluorescence intensity of the donor, $F$, is proportional to its fluorescence quantum yield, $\\Phi_F$.\nThe quantum yield of the donor in the absence of the acceptor (cleaved probe, where $r \\to \\infty$ and thus $k_T = 0$) is:\n$$\n\\Phi_{D} = \\frac{k_F}{k_F + k_{NR}}\n$$\nThe quantum yield of the donor in the presence of the acceptor (intact probe) is:\n$$\n\\Phi_{DA} = \\frac{k_F}{k_F + k_{NR} + k_T}\n$$\nThe residual background fluorescence fraction, which we denote as $f_{res}$, is the ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the intact probe ($F_{intact}$) to that of the cleaved probe ($F_{cleaved}$), under identical excitation conditions. This is equivalent to the ratio of their respective quantum yields:\n$$\nf_{res} = \\frac{F_{intact}}{F_{cleaved}} = \\frac{\\Phi_{DA}}{\\Phi_{D}} = \\frac{\\frac{k_F}{k_F + k_{NR} + k_T}}{\\frac{k_F}{k_F + k_{NR}}} = \\frac{k_F + k_{NR}}{k_F + k_{NR} + k_T}\n$$\nUsing the relationship $k_F + k_{NR} = 1/\\tau_D$ and $k_F + k_{NR} + k_T = 1/\\tau_{DA}$, we can express this fraction as:\n$$\nf_{res} = \\frac{1/\\tau_D}{1/\\tau_{DA}} = \\frac{\\tau_{DA}}{\\tau_D}\n$$\nWe can relate this fraction to the FRET efficiency, $E$. Starting with the definition of $E$:\n$$\nE = \\frac{k_T}{k_F + k_{NR} + k_T} = \\frac{(k_F + k_{NR} + k_T) - (k_F + k_{NR})}{k_F + k_{NR} + k_T} = 1 - \\frac{k_F + k_{NR}}{k_F + k_{NR} + k_T}\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nE = 1 - f_{res} \\quad \\implies \\quad f_{res} = 1 - E\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E$ in terms of $r$ and $R_0$:\n$$\nf_{res} = 1 - \\frac{R_0^6}{r^6 + R_0^6} = \\frac{r^6 + R_0^6 - R_0^6}{r^6 + R_0^6} = \\frac{r^6}{r^6 + R_0^6}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the numerical value using the given data: $r = 2\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $R_0 = 4.5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n$$\nf_{res} = \\frac{(2)^6}{(2)^6 + (4.5)^6}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the powers:\n$$\n2^6 = 64\n$$\n$$\n(4.5)^6 = \\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right)^6 = \\frac{9^6}{2^6} = \\frac{531441}{64} = 8303.765625\n$$\nNow substitute these values into the expression for $f_{res}$:\n$$\nf_{res} = \\frac{64}{64 + 8303.765625} = \\frac{64}{8367.765625}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nf_{res} \\approx 0.007648439...\n$$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nf_{res} \\approx 0.007648\n$$\nThis value represents the fraction of fluorescence that remains (is not quenched) when the probe is intact, compared to the maximum possible fluorescence after cleavage.

In the exponential phase, this is modeled by setting $F_{\\mathrm{Cq}} = F_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\nUsing the exponential phase approximation $F_n \\approx \\alpha N_n = \\alpha N_0(1+E)^n$ and the definition $F_{\\mathrm{th}}=\\alpha N_{\\mathrm{th}}$, we have:\n$$\n\\alpha N_0 (1+E)^{\\mathrm{Cq}} = \\alpha N_{\\mathrm{th}}\n$$\nDividing by $\\alpha$ (which is non-zero), we get:\n$$\nN_0 (1+E)^{\\mathrm{Cq}} = N_{\\mathrm{th}}\n$$\nTo solve for Cq, we first isolate the exponential term:\n$$\n(1+E)^{\\mathrm{Cq}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{th}}}{N_0}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left((1+E)^{\\mathrm{Cq}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{th}}}{N_0}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cq} \\ln(1+E) = \\ln(N_{\\mathrm{th}}) - \\ln(N_0)\n$$\nIsolating Cq gives the expression as a function of $E$, $N_{\\mathrm{th}}$, and $N_0$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cq} = \\frac{\\ln(N_{\\mathrm{th}}) - \\ln(N_0)}{\\ln(1+E)} = \\frac{\\ln(N_{\\mathrm{th}}/N_0)}{\\ln(1+E)}\n$$\nNow, we derive the expression for the Cq difference, $\\Delta \\mathrm{Cq}$, between two reactions with efficiencies $E_1$ and $E_2$ but the same $N_0$ and $N_{\\mathrm{th}}$. Let $\\mathrm{Cq}_1$ and $\\mathrm{Cq}_2$ be the Cq values for efficiencies $E_1$ and $E_2$, respectively.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cq}_1 = \\frac{\\ln(N_{\\mathrm{th}}/N_0)}{\\ln(1+E_1)}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cq}_2 = \\frac{\\ln(N_{\\mathrm{th}}/N_0)}{\\ln(1+E_2)}\n$$\nThe difference $\\Delta \\mathrm{Cq}$ is $\\mathrm{Cq}_2 - \\mathrm{Cq}_1$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{Cq} = \\frac{\\ln(N_{\\mathrm{th}}/N_0)}{\\ln(1+E_2)} - \\frac{\\ln(N_{\\mathrm{th}}/N_0)}{\\ln(1+E_1)}\n$$\nFactoring out the common logarithmic term:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{Cq} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{th}}}{N_0}\\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\ln(1+E_2)} - \\frac{1}{\\ln(1+E_1)} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the required analytical expression for the Cq difference.\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Calculation\n\nWe are asked to compute $\\Delta \\mathrm{Cq}$ for a reaction where efficiency decreases from $E_1=0.95$ to $E_2=0.85$.\nThe given parameters are:\n-   $N_0 = 2.0 \\times 10^2$\n-   $N_{\\mathrm{th}} = 2.0 \\times 10^9$\n-   $E_1 = 0.95$\n-   $E_2 = 0.85$\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratio $N_{\\mathrm{th}}/N_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{th}}}{N_0} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^9}{2.0 \\times 10^2} = 10^7\n$$\nNow we can use the expression for $\\Delta \\mathrm{Cq}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{Cq} = \\ln(10^7) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\ln(1+0.85)} - \\frac{1}{\\ln(1+0.95)} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{Cq} = 7\\ln(10) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\ln(1.85)} - \\frac{1}{\\ln(1.95)} \\right)\n$$\nWe now substitute the numerical values for the natural logarithms and compute the result.\nUsing $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$, $\\ln(1.85) \\approx 0.615186$, and $\\ln(1.95) \\approx 0.667829$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{Cq} \\approx 7 \\times 2.302585 \\left( \\frac{1}{0.615186} - \\frac{1}{0.667829} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{Cq} \\approx 16.118095 \\left( 1.625523 - 1.497380 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{Cq} \\approx 16.118095 \\times 0.128143\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{Cq} \\approx 2.06533\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{Cq} \\approx 2.065\n$$\nThe unit is cycles.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2.065} $$", "id": "5151328"}]}
