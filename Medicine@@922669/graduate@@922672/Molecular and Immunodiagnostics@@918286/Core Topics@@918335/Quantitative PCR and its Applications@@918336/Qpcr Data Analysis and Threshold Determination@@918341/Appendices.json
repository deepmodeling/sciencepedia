The optical readout follows an ideal proportional fluorescence model in which fluorescence $F(c)$ at cycle $c$ is directly proportional to the amplicon count $N(c)$, and the instrument declares detection when the fluorescence crosses a fixed threshold.

It describes a standard, albeit idealized, model of quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) and requests the derivation and calculation of the quantification cycle ($C_q$). All provided information is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle of qPCR in its exponential phase is that the amount of target DNA (amplicon) increases by a constant factor with each thermal cycle. Let $N(c)$ be the number of amplicon copies at the end of cycle $c$. The initial number of copies is given as $N_0$. The per-cycle amplification efficiency, $E$, is the fraction of templates that are successfully replicated in a single cycle. Therefore, the number of new copies generated in cycle $c$ is $E \\times N(c-1)$. The total number of copies at the end of cycle $c$ is the sum of the copies from the previous cycle and the newly synthesized copies:\n$$N(c) = N(c-1) + E \\cdot N(c-1) = N(c-1)(1+E)$$\nThis recurrence relation describes the geometric growth of the amplicon population. By unrolling the recurrence from cycle $c$ down to cycle $0$, we obtain the explicit formula for the number of copies at any cycle $c$:\n$$N(c) = N_0 (1+E)^c$$\nThis equation models the exponential amplification phase of the reaction.\n\nThe problem states that the instrument's detection is based on fluorescence, $F(c)$, which is directly proportional to the amplicon count, $N(c)$. This can be written as $F(c) = k \\cdot N(c)$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality. The detection threshold is a fixed fluorescence level, which, under this proportional model, corresponds to a fixed number of amplicon copies, denoted as $T$.\n\nThe quantification cycle, $C_q$, is defined as the real-valued (i.e., fractional) cycle number at which the amplicon count reaches this threshold, $T$. We can find $C_q$ by setting $N(c) = T$ and $c = C_q$ in the amplification equation:\n$$T = N_0 (1+E)^{C_q}$$\nThis is the equation we must solve to find the expression for $C_q$.\n\nTo solve for the exponent $C_q$, we first isolate the exponential term by dividing both sides by the initial copy number, $N_0$:\n$$\\frac{T}{N_0} = (1+E)^{C_q}$$\nNext, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides of the equation. This allows us to bring the exponent $C_q$ down as a multiplicative factor, based on the logarithmic identity $\\ln(x^y) = y \\ln(x)$:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{N_0}\\right) = \\ln\\left((1+E)^{C_q}\\right)$$\n$$\\ln(T) - \\ln(N_0) = C_q \\ln(1+E)$$\nFinally, we isolate $C_q$ by dividing by $\\ln(1+E)$:\n$$C_q = \\frac{\\ln(T) - \\ln(N_0)}{\\ln(1+E)}$$\nThis is the derived general expression for the real-valued quantification cycle under the ideal proportional fluorescence model with constant efficiency. It can also be written as $C_q = \\frac{\\ln(T/N_0)}{\\ln(1+E)}$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $C_q$ using the data provided in the problem statement:\n- Initial template copy number: $N_0 = 100 = 10^2$\n- Threshold template copy number: $T = 10^7$\n- Per-cycle amplification efficiency: $E = 0.95$\n\nThe amplification factor per cycle is $(1+E) = 1 + 0.95 = 1.95$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $C_q$:\n$$C_q = \\frac{\\ln(10^7) - \\ln(10^2)}{\\ln(1.95)}$$\nUsing the logarithm properties $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$ and $\\ln(a)-\\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, the numerator simplifies:\n$$\\ln(10^7) - \\ln(10^2) = 7 \\ln(10) - 2 \\ln(10) = 5 \\ln(10)$$\nSo, the expression for $C_q$ becomes:\n$$C_q = \\frac{5 \\ln(10)}{\\ln(1.95)}$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$C_q = \\frac{5 \\times \\ln(10)}{\\ln(1.95)} \\approx \\frac{5 \\times 2.302585}{0.667829} \\approx \\frac{11.512925}{0.667829} \\approx 17.239361...$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
