To obtain an absolute count, they spike the sample with monodisperse counting beads of known concentration and acquire events on a calibrated instrument. The acquisition is set so that the bead and cell events are recorded from the same well-mixed tube under identical fluidics and detection settings, and debris, doublets, and dead cells are excluded by appropriate gating. The following quantities are measured: the number of live cell events counted is $N_{\\text{cells}} = 18{,}500$; the number of bead events counted is $N_{\\text{beads}} = 9{,}250$; the counting bead concentration is $C_{\\text{beads}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{mL}^{-1}$.

Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe fundamental principle of absolute counting using reference beads is that for a well-mixed sample containing cells and beads, the ratio of the number of events counted for each population is equal to the ratio of their concentrations in the sample being analyzed.\n\nLet $C'_{\\text{cells}}$ be the concentration of live cells in the acquisition tube (the diluted sample) and $C_{\\text{beads}}$ be the known concentration of the counting beads in the same tube.

For a Newtonian fluid, the shear stress $\\tau$ is defined by the relationship $\\tau = \\mu \\left| \\frac{du}{dr} \\right|$, where $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity and $\\frac{du}{dr}$ is the velocity gradient in the radial direction $r$.\n\nFor steady, fully developed laminar flow in a circular pipe of radius $R$ (Hagen-Poiseuille flow), the velocity profile is parabolic:\n$$u(r) = u_{max} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2} \\right)$$\nwhere $u_{max}$ is the maximum velocity at the centerline ($r=0$).\n\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is given by the integral of the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area $A = \\pi R^2$. The average velocity $\\bar{u}$ is related to the maximum velocity by $\\bar{u} = \\frac{1}{2} u_{max}$. The flow rate is also defined by the total volume $V$ dispensed over time $t$:\n$$Q = A \\bar{u} = (\\pi R^2) \\left(\\frac{1}{2} u_{max}\\right) = \\frac{V}{t}$$\nFrom this, we can express the maximum velocity in terms of the experimental parameters:\n$$u_{max} = \\frac{2Q}{\\pi R^2} = \\frac{2V}{\\pi R^2 t}$$\nNext, we find the velocity gradient by differentiating the velocity profile $u(r)$ with respect to $r$:\n$$\\frac{du}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ u_{max} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2} \\right) \\right] = u_{max} \\left( -\\frac{2r}{R^2} \\right)$$\nThe shear stress $\\tau(r)$ at any radial position $r$ is then:\n$$\\tau(r) = \\mu \\left| \\frac{du}{dr} \\right| = \\mu u_{max} \\frac{2r}{R^2}$$\nCell damage is primarily caused by the maximum shear stress, which occurs at the wall of the pipette tip, where $r=R$. The wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$, is:\n$$\\tau_w = \\tau(R) = \\mu u_{max} \\frac{2R}{R^2} = \\frac{2 \\mu u_{max}}{R}$$\nSubstituting our expression for $u_{max}$:\n$$\\tau_w = \\frac{2\\mu}{R} \\left( \\frac{2V}{\\pi R^2 t} \\right) = \\frac{4\\mu V}{\\pi R^3 t}$$\nThis final expression shows that the wall shear stress is inversely proportional to the cube of the radius ($R^3$) and inversely proportional to the dispense time ($t$).\n\n**Part 2: Prediction of PI-Positive Fraction Ordering**\nWe assume that the fraction of PI-positive (non-viable) cells increases with the magnitude of the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$. We need to rank $\\tau_w$ for the four conditions:\n1.  Small-bore fast ($R_1,t_f$): $\\tau_{w,1f} \\propto \\frac{1}{R_1^3 t_f}$\n2.  Small-bore slow ($R_1,t_s$): $\\tau_{w,1s} \\propto \\frac{1}{R_1^3 t_s}$\n3.  Large-bore fast ($R_2,t_f$): $\\tau_{w,2f} \\propto \\frac{1}{R_2^3 t_f}$\n4.  Large-bore slow ($R_2,t_s$): $\\tau_{w,2s} \\propto \\frac{1}{R_2^3 t_s}$\n\nGiven data: $R_1 = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $R_2 = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 2R_1$, $t_f = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and $t_s = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{s} = 4t_f$.\nLet's find the relative magnitudes. Let the relative shear for the lowest-stress condition ($R_2, t_s$) be $1$.\n- $\\tau_{w,2s} \\propto \\frac{1}{(2R_1)^3 (4t_f)} = \\frac{1}{32 R_1^3 t_f}$.\n- $\\tau_{w,2f} \\propto \\frac{1}{(2R_1)^3 t_f} = \\frac{1}{8 R_1^3 t_f} = 4 \\times \\tau_{w,2s}$.\n- $\\tau_{w,1s} \\propto \\frac{1}{R_1^3 (4t_f)} = \\frac{1}{4 R_1^3 t_f} = 8 \\times \\tau_{w,2s}$.\n- $\\tau_{w,1f} \\propto \\frac{1}{R_1^3 t_f} = 32 \\times \\tau_{w,2s}$.\n\nThus, the ordering of wall shear stress from highest to lowest is:\n$\\tau_{w,1f} > \\tau_{w,1s} > \\tau_{w,2f} > \\tau_{w,2s}$.\nThe predicted order of PI-positive fractions is therefore: small-bore fast > small-bore slow > large-bore fast > large-bore slow.\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation of Options**\n\n**Option A**\n(i) **Experimental Design**: Proposes comparing $R_1, t_f$ versus $R_2, t_f$. This comparison is performed at a fixed residence (dispense) time $t_f$. The contrast in shear stress is the ratio $\\tau_{w,1f}/\\tau_{w,2f} = (R_2/R_1)^3 = 2^3 = 8$. A comparison at fixed radius (e.g., $R_1, t_f$ vs $R_1, t_s$) would yield a contrast of $t_s/t_f = 4$. Therefore, comparing different radii at a fixed time maximizes the shear contrast. This criterion is satisfied.\n(ii) **Analysis Plan**: The plan is excellent. It specifies a sufficient number of events ($N=20{,}000$), use of counting beads for absolute normalization, essential gating steps (debris exclusion via FSC/SSC, singlets), and the use of proper live/dead controls to set PI gates. Furthermore, it suggests advanced quantification methods (medians, IQRs, mixture modeling) that are appropriate for analyzing fluorescence distributions. This plan is scientifically rigorous. This criterion is satisfied.\n(iii) **Prediction**: The predicted order of PI-positive fractions is $R_1,t_f > R_1,t_s > R_2,t_f > R_2,t_s$. This exactly matches the order derived from first principles. This criterion is satisfied.\n**Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B**\n(i) **Experimental Design**: Proposes comparing $R_1, t_f$ versus $R_1, t_s$. As shown above, this yields a shear contrast of $4$, which is not maximal. The maximal contrast is $8$. This criterion is not satisfied.\n(ii) **Analysis Plan**: The plan is deeply flawed. It suggests assessing viability by mean Forward Scatter (FSC), which is a measure of cell size, not membrane integrity. Dying cells can either shrink or swell, making FSC an unreliable and indirect marker for viability compared to PI. It also advises skipping doublet discrimination, a critical step for accurate flow cytometry analysis. This criterion is not satisfied.\n(iii) **Prediction**: The predicted ordering is $R_2,t_f > R_1,t_f > R_1,t_s > R_2,t_s$. This incorrectly suggests that the large-bore fast condition is more damaging than the small-bore fast condition, contradicting the $\\tau_w \\propto 1/R^3$ relationship. This criterion is not satisfied.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C**\n(i) **Experimental Design**: Proposes comparing $R_1, t_s$ against $R_2, t_f$ with the claim of holding shear \"approximately constant\". As calculated from our ratios, $\\tau_{w,1s}$ is twice as large as $\\tau_{w,2f}$ ($8$ vs $4$ relative units). A factor of $2$ is not \"approximately constant\". Furthermore, the goal is to maximize contrast, not hold it constant. This criterion is not satisfied.\n(ii) **Analysis Plan**: The plan is poor. It omits essential live/dead controls for setting gates and relies on an arbitrary \"manufacturer-recommended threshold\", which ignores instrument variability and cell autofluorescence. This is not a robust method. This criterion is not satisfied.\n(iii) **Prediction**: The predicted ordering is $R_1,t_s > R_2,t_f > R_1,t_f > R_2,t_s$. This is incorrect; for example, it claims the small-bore slow condition is more damaging than the small-bore fast condition, contradicting the $\\tau_w \\propto 1/t$ relationship. This criterion is not satisfied.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D**\n(i) **Experimental Design**: Proposes comparing $R_2, t_f$ versus $R_2, t_s$. This yields a shear contrast of $4$, which is not maximal. This criterion is not satisfied.\n(ii) **Analysis Plan**: The plan is flawed. It substitutes PI with Calcein-AM, which measures a different aspect of cell health (esterase activity in live cells) and was not the specified assay. It also advises omitting debris gating, which will contaminate the analysis with non-cellular events and lead to incorrect quantification. This criterion is not satisfied.\n(iii) **Prediction**: The predicted ordering is $R_1,t_f > R_2,t_f > R_1,t_s > R_2,t_s$. This incorrectly swaps the order of the small-bore slow ($R_1,t_s$) and large-bore fast ($R_2,t_f$) conditions. As calculated, $\\tau_{w,1s} = 2 \\tau_{w,2f}$, so the small-bore slow condition has higher shear. This criterion is not satisfied.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, only Option A correctly satisfies all three criteria: it proposes an experimental design that maximizes shear stress contrast, outlines a scientifically rigorous analysis protocol, and correctly predicts the ordering of cell damage based on a first-principles physical model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5097252"}]}
