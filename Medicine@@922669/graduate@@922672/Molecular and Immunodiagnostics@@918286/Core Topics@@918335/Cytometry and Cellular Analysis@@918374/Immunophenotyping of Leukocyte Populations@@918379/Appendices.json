Assuming non-cooperative monovalent binding under homogeneous conditions, the fractional occupancy of antigen sites on target cells by an antibody at concentration $C$ is given by the Langmuir isotherm $f(C) = \\frac{C}{C + K_{d}}$, where $K_{d}$ is the equilibrium dissociation constant. The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the antigen-positive population is proportional to occupancy up to an instrument-limited saturation, while the negative population exhibits background autofluorescence and a saturable non-specific binding component.

However, the resulting expression is an algebraically intractable high-degree polynomial. A more practical approach is to analyze the behavior of the function $SI(C)$.\n\nFor a constrained optimization problem on an interval, the maximum must occur either at a critical point within the interval or at one of the boundaries. We need to determine if the unconstrained maximum of $SI(C)$ lies inside or outside the feasible region $[0, 0.7]$.\n\nNumerical evaluation or plotting of the function $SI(C)$ for $C \\ge 0$ reveals that it is a monotonically increasing function for small values of $C$, eventually reaching a broad maximum at a concentration significantly greater than $0.7$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of analytical cytometry, well-posed, objective, and contains a complete and consistent set of information required for a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an analytic expression for the absolute concentration of leukocytes, $C_{\\text{cells}}$, based on first principles provided in the statement.

The goal is to determine $C_{\\text{cells}}$ from the known quantities $N_{\\text{cells}}$, $N_{\\text{beads}}$, and $C_{\\text{beads}}$. The volume $V_{a}$ is an unknown nuisance parameter that must be eliminated. We can achieve this by isolating $V_{a}$ in one equation and substituting it into the other.\n\nFrom equation (2), we can solve for the analyzed volume $V_{a}$:\n$$ V_{a} = \\frac{N_{\\text{beads}}}{C_{\\text{beads}}} $$\nThis expression represents the volume of sample that must have been analyzed to yield $N_{\\text{beads}}$ counts, given a bead concentration of $C_{\\text{beads}}$.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $V_{a}$ into equation (1):\n$$ N_{\\text{cells}} = C_{\\text{cells}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{N_{\\text{beads}}}{C_{\\text{beads}}}\\right) $$\n\nFinally, we rearrange this equation to solve for the desired quantity, the absolute leukocyte concentration $C_{\\text{cells}}$:\n$$ C_{\\text{cells}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{cells}}}{N_{\\text{beads}}} \\cdot C_{\\text{beads}} $$\nThis is the required analytic expression. It demonstrates that the unknown cell concentration can be determined by scaling the known bead concentration by the ratio of cell counts to bead counts.

All necessary data and definitions are provided to compute a unique, meaningful answer. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe primary task is to calculate the gating threshold, $I_{\\text{gate}}$, on the linear fluorescence intensity scale.

The choice of a threshold inherently involves a trade-off between false positives (Type I error) and false negatives (Type II error).\n\nA **false positive** occurs when a cell that is truly negative (i.e., its fluorescence belongs to the background FMO distribution) is classified as positive because its intensity falls above the gate, $I > I_{\\text{gate}}$. Since the log-transformed FMO data is modeled as a Gaussian-distributed random variable $L \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\text{FMO}}, \\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}^2)$, the probability of a false positive is the probability that $L > L_{\\text{gate}}$. We set $L_{\\text{gate}} = \\mu_{\\text{FMO}} + 3\\,\\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}$. The false-positive rate is therefore the area in the upper tail of the Gaussian distribution beyond three standard deviations from the mean.\nFor a standard normal distribution $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, this probability is:\n$$P(\\text{False Positive}) = P(L > \\mu_{\\text{FMO}} + 3\\,\\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}) = P(Z > 3) \\approx 0.00135$$\nThis corresponds to a false-positive rate of approximately $0.135\\%$. By setting the gate at $3\\,\\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}$, the experimenter chooses to maintain a very low rate of incorrectly classifying background events as positive. This prioritizes high specificity.\n\nA **false negative** occurs when a cell that is truly positive (i.e., expressing the marker of interest) is classified as negative because its intensity falls at or below the gate, $I \\le I_{\\text{gate}}$. The rate of false negatives depends on the fluorescence distribution of the *positive* population. Let's assume the positive population also has a log-normal distribution, characterized by parameters $\\mu_{\\text{pos}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{pos}}$. A false negative occurs if a cell from this population has a log-intensity $L_{\\text{pos}} \\le L_{\\text{gate}}$.\nThe problem states the marker is \"dimly expressed,\" which implies that the positive population's distribution is not well-separated from the negative (FMO) distribution; i.e., $\\mu_{\\text{pos}}$ is only slightly greater than $\\mu_{\\text{FMO}}$. By setting a stringent (high) threshold like $L_{\\text{gate}} = \\mu_{\\text{FMO}} + 3\\,\\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}$ to minimize false positives, a substantial portion of the dim positive population may fall below this threshold. This results in a high false-negative rate and, consequently, low sensitivity (low power to detect true positives).\n\nIn summary, the trade-off is as follows:\n- A more stringent (higher) gate, e.g., at $4\\,\\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}$, would further decrease the false-positive rate but increase the false-negative rate, making it even harder to detect dim signals.\n- A more lenient (lower) gate, e.g., at $2\\,\\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}$, would increase the false-positive rate (to about $2.28\\%$) but decrease the false-negative rate, improving the detection of a dim positive population.\n\nThe choice of $3\\,\\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}$ is a conventional compromise that heavily favors specificity over sensitivity. The monotonic nature of the exponential function, $I = \\exp(L)$, ensures that the gating decision and all associated error probabilities are equivalent on both the log and linear scales. If A > B on the log scale, then exp(A) > exp(B) on the linear scale.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{665.1}\n$$", "id": "5124163"}]}
