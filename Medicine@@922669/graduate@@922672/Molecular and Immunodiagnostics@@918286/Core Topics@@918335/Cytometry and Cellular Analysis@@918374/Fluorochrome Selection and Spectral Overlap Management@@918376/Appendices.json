The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe measured brightness, $B$, of a fluorochrome in a flow cytometry experiment is proportional to the rate of detected fluorescence photons. This rate is the product of several factors: the rate of incident excitation photons, the probability of photon absorption, the fluorescence quantum yield, and the efficiencies of light collection, filtering, and detection.\n\nLet $N_{inc}$ be the number of incident photons per unit time. The number of absorbed photons per unit time, $N_{abs}$, is given by $N_{abs} = N_{inc} \\times P_{abs}$, where $P_{abs}$ is the absorption probability. The number of emitted fluorescence photons per unit time, $N_{em}$, is $N_{em} = N_{abs} \\times \\phi = N_{inc} \\times P_{abs} \\times \\phi$, where $\\phi$ is the fluorescence quantum yield.\n\nThe detected signal, or brightness $B$, is proportional to the number of emitted photons that are successfully collected, transmitted through the optical filter, and detected. This can be expressed as:\n$$B = k \\cdot N_{inc} \\cdot P_{abs} \\cdot \\phi \\cdot \\eta_{\\mathrm{opt}}$$\nwhere $\\eta_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ is the transmission of the bandpass filter and $k$ is a proportionality constant that includes the instrumental collection and detector efficiencies, which are stated to be identical for measurements of $A$ and $B$.\n\nThe absorption probability, $P_{abs}$, is related to the absorbance, $A$, from the Beer-Lambert law. The absorbance is defined as $A = \\epsilon c l$, where $\\epsilon$ is the molar extinction coefficient (in units of $\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$), $c$ is the molar concentration, and $l$ is the optical path length. The Beer-Lambert law relates the incident intensity, $I_{inc}$, to the transmitted intensity, $I_{trans}$:\n$$\\frac{I_{trans}}{I_{inc}} = 10^{-A} = 10^{-\\epsilon c l}$$\nThe fraction of light absorbed is $\\frac{I_{inc} - I_{trans}}{I_{inc}} = 1 - \\frac{I_{trans}}{I_{inc}}$. Since the number of photons is proportional to intensity, this is equivalent to the absorption probability $P_{abs}$:\n$$P_{abs} = 1 - 10^{-\\epsilon c l}$$\nThe problem specifies the low-absorbance regime, where $A = \\epsilon c l \\ll 1$. In this limit, we can linearize the expression for $P_{abs}$ using the Taylor series expansion for the exponential function $a^x \\approx 1 + x \\ln(a)$ for small $x$. Setting $a=10$ and $x = -\\epsilon c l$:\n$$10^{-\\epsilon c l} \\approx 1 - (\\epsilon c l) \\ln(10)$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the expression for $P_{abs}$:\n$$P_{abs} \\approx 1 - (1 - \\epsilon c l \\ln(10)) = \\epsilon c l \\ln(10)$$\nThus, in the low-absorbance limit, the absorption probability is directly proportional to the product $\\epsilon c l$.\n\nNow we substitute this linearized expression for $P_{abs}$ back into the equation for brightness $B$:\n$$B \\approx k \\cdot N_{inc} \\cdot (\\epsilon c l \\ln(10)) \\cdot \\phi \\cdot \\eta_{\\mathrm{opt}}$$\nThe problem states that $k$, $N_{inc}$ (from identical photon flux), $c$, and $l$ are the same for both fluorochromes $A$ and $B$. Therefore, we can write the brightness for each dye as:\n$$B_A \\propto \\epsilon_A \\phi_A \\eta_{\\mathrm{opt},A}$$\n$$B_B \\propto \\epsilon_B \\phi_B \\eta_{\\mathrm{opt},B}$$\nThe ratio of the brightnesses is then:\n$$\\frac{B_A}{B_B} = \\frac{\\epsilon_A \\phi_A \\eta_{\\mathrm{opt},A}}{\\epsilon_B \\phi_B \\eta_{\\mathrm{opt},B}}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the ratio of measured brightnesses. The product $\\epsilon \\phi$ is the intrinsic molecular brightness of the dye, and the measured brightness in a specific channel is this value modulated by the filter's efficiency $\\eta_{\\mathrm{opt}}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this ratio using the provided numerical values:\n-   $\\epsilon_A = 1.0 \\times 10^5$\n-   $\\phi_A = 0.6$\n-   $\\eta_{\\mathrm{opt},A} = 0.8$\n-   $\\epsilon_B = 0.5 \\times 10^5$\n-   $\\phi_B = 0.95$\n-   $\\eta_{\\mathrm{opt},B} = 0.6$\n\nSubstituting these values into the ratio expression:\n$$\\frac{B_A}{B_B} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^5) \\cdot (0.6) \\cdot (0.8)}{(0.5 \\times 10^5) \\cdot (0.95) \\cdot (0.6)}$$\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling common factors. The factor of $10^5$ in the numerator and denominator cancels. The factor of $0.6$ also cancels.\n$$\\frac{B_A}{B_B} = \\frac{1.0 \\cdot 0.8}{0.5 \\cdot 0.95}$$\nThe numerator is $0.8$. The denominator is $0.5 \\times 0.95 = 0.475$.\n$$\\frac{B_A}{B_B} = \\frac{0.8}{0.475}$$\nTo express this as a simplified exact fraction, we can write the decimals as fractions or multiply the numerator and denominator by $1000$:\n$$\\frac{B_A}{B_B} = \\frac{800}{475}$$\nBoth the numerator and the denominator are divisible by $25$.\n$800 \\div 25 = 32$.\n$475 \\div 25 = 19$.\nTherefore, the simplified exact ratio is:\n$$\\frac{B_A}{B_B} = \\frac{32}{19}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{32}{19}}$$", "id": "5117184"}, {"introduction": "In multiparameter flow cytometry, fluorochromes are not used in isolation, leading to the central challenge of spectral overlap.

A second antigen is measured in channel $Y$.\n-   Photon detection is a Poisson process: for mean $\\lambda$, variance is $\\lambda$.\n-   Compensated signal in channel $X$ is $X_{c} = X_{m} - s\\,Y_{m}$, where $s$ is the spillover coefficient, $X_{m}$ is the measured $X$ intensity, and $Y_{m}$ is the measured $Y$ intensity.\n-   Assumption (stipulation): The mean of $X_{c}$ for $X$-negative events is the $X$ baseline (autofluorescence).\n-   Assumption (stipulation): The variance of $X_{c}$ for $X$-negative events is $\\operatorname{var}(X_{c}) = \\operatorname{var}(X_{m}) + s^{2}\\operatorname{var}(Y_{m})$.\n-   A Fluorescence-Minus-One (FMO) control is used to characterize the distribution of $X_{c}$ for $X$-negative events.\n-   Spillover Spreading Error (SSE) is the variance inflation from compensation.\n-   Gating objective: Set a threshold $t$ on $X_{c}$ to achieve a type I error rate (false positives) of $\\alpha = 0.01$ and minimize the type II error rate (false negatives).\n-   Candidate $Y_{a}$: spillover $s_{a} = 0.30$, mean brightness $\\lambda_{Y,a} = 2000$.\n-   Candidate $Y_{b}$: spillover $s_{b} = 0.10$, mean brightness $\\lambda_{Y,b} = 500$.\n-   $X$ channel baseline (autofluorescence) for negatives: Poisson with mean $\\lambda_{X,0} = 200$.\n-   $X$-positive signal: an independent Poisson signal with mean $\\lambda_{S} = 80$ is added to the baseline.\n-   The distribution of $X_c$ is approximated as Gaussian.\n-   $z_{1-\\alpha}$ is the $(1-\\alpha)$ standard normal quantile.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is well-grounded in the principles of flow cytometry and immunodiagnostics. The concepts of spectral overlap, linear compensation, spillover spreading error (SSE), FMO controls, and statistical gating are standard in the field. The modeling of photon counting as a Poisson process and the use of a Gaussian approximation for large counts are standard and valid statistical approaches. The formula for variance propagation, $\\operatorname{var}(A - B) = \\operatorname{var}(A) + \\operatorname{var}(B)$ for independent $A$ and $B$, is correctly applied to derive the expression for $\\operatorname{var}(X_{c})$.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides two distinct candidates ($Y_a$, $Y_b$) and a clear, quantitative criterion for choosing between them: minimize type II error for a fixed type I error rate of $\\alpha=0.01$. All necessary parameters ($\\lambda_{X,0}$, $\\lambda_S$, $s_a$, $\\lambda_{Y,a}$, $s_b$, $\\lambda_{Y,b}$, $\\alpha$) are provided to perform the required calculations.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, formal language. It uses standard terminology from the field of flow cytometry and statistics. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. The premises are consistent and realistic within the context of a simplified biophysical model. The problem is **valid**. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine which fluorochrome for channel $Y$ results in better separation between $X$-negative and $X$-positive populations, thereby minimizing the false-negative rate for a fixed false-positive rate. This requires modeling the distributions of the compensated signal $X_c$ for both populations and for each candidate fluorochrome.\n\n**1. Model the Negative Population (FMO Control)**\nThe FMO control represents the $X$-negative population. The fluorochrome for channel $X$ is absent, so the signal in this channel arises only from autofluorescence.\n-   The mean of the compensated signal for negatives is stipulated to be the baseline: $\\mu_{\\text{FMO}} = \\mathbb{E}[X_{c, \\text{neg}}] = \\lambda_{X,0} = 200$.\n-   The variance of the compensated signal is derived from the propagation of variance from independent Poisson sources:\n    $\\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}^{2} = \\operatorname{var}(X_{c, \\text{neg}}) = \\operatorname{var}(X_m) + s^2 \\operatorname{var}(Y_m)$.\n    Given $X_m \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_{X,0})$ and $Y_m \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_Y)$, we have $\\operatorname{var}(X_m) = \\lambda_{X,0}$ and $\\operatorname{var}(Y_m) = \\lambda_Y$.\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}^{2} = \\lambda_{X,0} + s^2 \\lambda_Y $$\n    The quantity $s^2 \\lambda_Y$ is the Spillover Spreading Error (SSE), representing the variance added to the $X$ channel due to spillover from the $Y$ channel.\n-   The distribution is approximated as Gaussian: $X_{c, \\text{neg}} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\text{FMO}}, \\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}^2)$.\n\n**2. Gate Setting Procedure**\nThe gate threshold $t$ must be set to ensure the type I error (false-positive rate) is $\\alpha = 0.01$.\n-   A false positive occurs when an $X$-negative event has a signal $X_c > t$.\n-   $P(X_{c, \\text{neg}} > t) = \\alpha = 0.01$.\n-   For a Gaussian distribution, this condition is met when $t$ is located at a specific number of standard deviations above the mean. Standardizing the variable:\n    $$ P\\left(\\frac{X_{c, \\text{neg}} - \\mu_{\\text{FMO}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}} > \\frac{t - \\mu_{\\text{FMO}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}}\\right) = \\alpha $$\n    This implies $\\frac{t - \\mu_{\\text{FMO}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}} = z_{1-\\alpha}$.\n-   Therefore, the threshold $t$ is:\n    $$ t = \\mu_{\\text{FMO}} + z_{1-\\alpha} \\sigma_{\\text{FMO}} $$\n-   For $\\alpha = 0.01$, the required quantile is $z_{0.99} \\approx 2.326$.\n\n**3. Model the Positive Population**\nFor $X$-positive events, a specific signal is added.\n-   The mean of the uncompensated signal in channel $X$ is $\\lambda_{X,0} + \\lambda_S$. Following the problem's framework where compensation correctly centers the mean, the mean of the compensated positive signal is:\n    $\\mu_{+} = \\mathbb{E}[X_{c, \\text{pos}}] = \\lambda_{X,0} + \\lambda_S = 200 + 80 = 280$.\n-   The variance of the positive signal is:\n    $\\sigma_{+}^{2} = \\operatorname{var}(X_{c, \\text{pos}}) = \\operatorname{var}(X_{m, \\text{pos}}) + s^2 \\operatorname{var}(Y_m)$.\n    For positives, $X_{m, \\text{pos}} \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_{X,0} + \\lambda_S)$, so $\\operatorname{var}(X_{m, \\text{pos}}) = \\lambda_{X,0} + \\lambda_S$.\n    $$ \\sigma_{+}^{2} = (\\lambda_{X,0} + \\lambda_S) + s^2 \\lambda_Y $$\n-   The distribution is approximated as Gaussian: $X_{c, \\text{pos}} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{+}, \\sigma_{+}^2)$.\n\n**4. Calculations for Candidate $Y_a$**\n($s_a = 0.30$, $\\lambda_{Y,a} = 2000$)\n-   **Negative Distribution**:\n    $\\mu_{\\text{FMO},a} = 200$.\n    $\\sigma_{\\text{FMO},a}^2 = 200 + (0.30)^2 \\times 2000 = 200 + 0.09 \\times 2000 = 200 + 180 = 380$.\n    $\\sigma_{\\text{FMO},a} = \\sqrt{380} \\approx 19.494$.\n-   **Threshold**:\n    $t_a = 200 + z_{0.99} \\sigma_{\\text{FMO},a} \\approx 200 + 2.326 \\times 19.494 \\approx 200 + 45.344 \\approx 245.34$.\n-   **Positive Distribution**:\n    $\\mu_{+,a} = 280$.\n    $\\sigma_{+,a}^2 = (200 + 80) + (0.30)^2 \\times 2000 = 280 + 180 = 460$.\n    $\\sigma_{+,a} = \\sqrt{460} \\approx 21.448$.\n-   **Type II Error ($\\beta_a$)**: Probability that a positive event falls below the threshold.\n    $\\beta_a = P(X_{c, \\text{pos}} < t_a)$.\n    Standardizing: $Z_{a} = \\frac{t_a - \\mu_{+,a}}{\\sigma_{+,a}} \\approx \\frac{245.34 - 280}{21.448} \\approx \\frac{-34.66}{21.448} \\approx -1.616$.\n    $\\beta_a = \\Phi(Z_{a}) = \\Phi(-1.616) \\approx 0.053$.\n\n**5. Calculations for Candidate $Y_b$**\n($s_b = 0.10$, $\\lambda_{Y,b} = 500$)\n-   **Negative Distribution**:\n    $\\mu_{\\text{FMO},b} = 200$.\n    $\\sigma_{\\text{FMO},b}^2 = 200 + (0.10)^2 \\times 500 = 200 + 0.01 \\times 500 = 200 + 5 = 205$.\n    $\\sigma_{\\text{FMO},b} = \\sqrt{205} \\approx 14.318$.\n-   **Threshold**:\n    $t_b = 200 + z_{0.99} \\sigma_{\\text{FMO},b} \\approx 200 + 2.326 \\times 14.318 \\approx 200 + 33.309 \\approx 233.31$.\n-   **Positive Distribution**:\n    $\\mu_{+,b} = 280$.\n    $\\sigma_{+,b}^2 = (200 + 80) + (0.10)^2 \\times 500 = 280 + 5 = 285$.\n    $\\sigma_{+,b} = \\sqrt{285} \\approx 16.882$.\n-   **Type II Error ($\\beta_b$)**:\n    $\\beta_b = P(X_{c, \\text{pos}} < t_b)$.\n    Standardizing: $Z_{b} = \\frac{t_b - \\mu_{+,b}}{\\sigma_{+,b}} \\approx \\frac{233.31 - 280}{16.882} \\approx \\frac{-46.69}{16.882} \\approx -2.766$.\n    $\\beta_b = \\Phi(Z_{b}) = \\Phi(-2.766) \\approx 0.0028$.\n\n**6. Comparison and Conclusion**\n-   The type II error for candidate $Y_a$ is $\\beta_a \\approx 0.053$ (or $5.3\\%$).\n-   The type II error for candidate $Y_b$ is $\\beta_b \\approx 0.003$ (or $0.3\\%$).\n-   To minimize the type II error, candidate $Y_b$ is the superior choice. The much smaller spillover spreading error ($SSE_b = 5$ vs. $SSE_a = 180$) leads to a tighter negative distribution, allowing a lower gate threshold, which in turn significantly reduces the probability of misclassifying true positives.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Compute $\\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}^{2}$ for each $Y$ choice as $\\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}^{2} = \\lambda_{X,0} + s^{2}\\lambda_{Y}$, so SSE is quantified by $\\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}^{2} - \\lambda_{X,0} = s^{2}\\lambda_{Y}$. Set the gate at $t = \\mu_{\\text{FMO}} + z_{1-\\alpha}\\,\\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}$ with $\\mu_{\\text{FMO}} = \\lambda_{X,0}$ to bound type I error at $\\alpha$. Then compute type II error for positives using the positive Gaussian approximation with mean $\\mu_{+} = \\lambda_{X,0} + \\lambda_{S}$ and variance $\\sigma_{+}^{2} = \\lambda_{X,0} + \\lambda_{S} + s^{2}\\lambda_{Y}$. For $Y_{a}$, $t \\approx 245.4$ and type II error $\\approx 0.053$; for $Y_{b}$, $t \\approx 233.3$ and type II error $\\approx 0.003$. Choose $Y_{b}$ to minimize type II error under the $\\alpha$ constraint.**\nThis option correctly states the formulas for the means and variances of both negative and positive populations based on the problem's premises. It correctly formulates the gate-setting procedure to control type I error. The numerical calculations for thresholds ($t_a \\approx 245.34$, $t_b \\approx 233.31$) and type II errors ($\\beta_a \\approx 0.053$, $\\beta_b \\approx 0.0028$) are accurate. The final choice of $Y_b$ is correct based on the objective to minimize type II error.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Quantify SSE using the FMO mean shift as $s\\,\\lambda_{Y}$ and set the gate at $t = \\mu_{\\text{FMO}} + 3\\,\\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}$ to be conservative, accepting a larger $\\alpha$ for fewer false negatives. Prefer $Y_{a}$ because the higher $Y$ brightness reduces total noise and therefore decreases false negatives.**\nThis option contains multiple errors. First, SSE is \"Spillover Spreading Error\", fundamentally a measure of variance inflation ($s^2\\lambda_Y$), not a mean shift. Second, setting a gate at $+3\\sigma$ corresponds to $\\alpha \\approx 0.0013$, which violates the requirement $\\alpha = 0.01$. Third, a higher gate threshold increases, not decreases, the false-negative rate. Fourth, the preference for $Y_a$ is incorrect; its high brightness and spillover *increase* the noise in channel $X$, harming sensitivity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Use single-stained controls for $X$ instead of FMO to estimate spillover and set the gate at $t = 2\\,\\mu_{\\text{FMO}}$, because doubling the mean separates negatives from positives without needing variance estimates. Prefer $Y_{a}$, as the higher brightness in $Y$ improves separation from $X$.**\nThis option is methodologically flawed. An FMO control is the correct tool to measure the spread of the negative population in a multicolor context, not a single-stain control. The gate-setting rule $t = 2\\mu_{\\text{FMO}}$ is arbitrary and not based on the statistical constraints given. The claim that separation can be achieved \"without needing variance estimates\" is a fundamental misunderstanding of statistical decision theory; separation is determined by both means and variances. The preference for $Y_a$ is also incorrect, as established previously.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Treat both negatives and positives as Gaussians with equal variance and set $t = (\\mu_{+} + \\mu_{\\text{FMO}})/2$ to minimize total misclassification error for equal priors, without regard to $\\alpha$. Prefer $Y_{a}$ because its higher median separation outweighs variance considerations.**\nThis option makes incorrect assumptions and disregards the problem's constraints. The variances of the negative and positive populations are not equal, as derived from the Poisson model ($\\sigma_+^2 = \\sigma_{\\text{FMO}}^2 + \\lambda_S$). The objective is *not* to minimize total misclassification error, but to fix type I error at $\\alpha=0.01$. The threshold $t = (\\mu_{+} + \\mu_{\\text{FMO}})/2$ is therefore inappropriate. The preference for $Y_a$ is again incorrect, and the reasoning about \"median separation\" is baseless, as the variance increase due to $Y_a$ is the dominant factor that degrades resolution.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5116990"}]}
