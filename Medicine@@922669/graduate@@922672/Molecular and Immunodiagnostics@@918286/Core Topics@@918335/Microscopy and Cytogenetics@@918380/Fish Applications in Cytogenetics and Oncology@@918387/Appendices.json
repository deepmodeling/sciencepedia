The laboratory defines a detection event as observing at least one nucleus carrying the abnormality among the counted nuclei.

It represents a standard application of statistical modeling in clinical cytogenetics. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution is provided below.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of nuclei counted, and let $p$ be the true fraction of the tumor cell population that carries the chromosomal abnormality (the subclone). Each nucleus is scored, and we assume this constitutes an independent Bernoulli trial. A \"success\" is defined as observing a nucleus with the abnormality, which occurs with probability $p$. A \"failure\" is observing a normal nucleus, which occurs with probability $1-p$. The assumption of perfect classification by the FISH technique means that there are no false positives or false negatives in the scoring of individual nuclei.\n\nLet the random variable $X$ represent the number of nuclei with the abnormality found among the $N$ nuclei counted. Under the stated assumptions, $X$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $N$ and $p$, which we denote as $X \\sim B(N, p)$.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for the binomial distribution gives the probability of observing exactly $k$ abnormal nuclei in a sample of size $N$:\n$$P(X=k) = \\binom{N}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N-k}$$\nwhere $k$ can be any integer from $0$ to $N$, and $\\binom{N}{k} = \\frac{N!}{k!(N-k)!}$ is the binomial coefficient.\n\nThe problem defines a \"detection event\" as observing at least one nucleus carrying the abnormality. This corresponds to the event $\\{X \\geq 1\\}$. The probability of this event, which we can call the detection probability $P_D$, is given by $P(X \\geq 1)$. It is more convenient to calculate this probability using the complement rule. The complement of observing at least one abnormal nucleus is observing zero abnormal nuclei, which is the event $\\{X=0\\}$.\n$$P_D = P(X \\geq 1) = 1 - P(X=0)$$\nUsing the binomial PMF for $k=0$, we find the probability of observing no abnormal nuclei:\n$$P(X=0) = \\binom{N}{0} p^0 (1-p)^{N-0} = \\frac{N!}{0!(N-0)!} \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1-p)^N = 1 \\cdot (1-p)^N = (1-p)^N$$\nSubstituting this back, we obtain the expression for the detection probability as a function of $N$ and $p$:\n$$P_D(N, p) = 1 - (1-p)^N$$\nThis is the required expression for the detection probability.\n\nThe next task is to determine the minimum whole number of nuclei, $N_{\\text{min}}$, required to achieve a detection probability of at least $0.95$ when the subclone fraction is $p = 0.10$. We set up the following inequality:\n$$P_D(N, 0.10) \\geq 0.95$$\n$$1 - (1-0.10)^N \\geq 0.95$$\n$$1 - (0.90)^N \\geq 0.95$$\nTo solve for $N$, we rearrange the inequality:\n$$- (0.90)^N \\geq 0.95 - 1$$\n$$- (0.90)^N \\geq -0.05$$\nMultiplying both sides by $-1$ reverses the inequality sign:\n$$(0.90)^N \\leq 0.05$$\nTo isolate the exponent $N$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. Since the natural logarithm function, $\\ln(x)$, is monotonically increasing for $x > 0$, the direction of the inequality is preserved:\n$$\\ln((0.90)^N) \\leq \\ln(0.05)$$\nUsing the logarithm power rule, $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$:\n$$N \\ln(0.90) \\leq \\ln(0.05)$$\nNow, we must solve for $N$. The value of $\\ln(0.90)$ is negative because its argument, $0.90$, is less than $1$. Therefore, dividing both sides of the inequality by $\\ln(0.90)$ requires reversing the inequality sign again:\n$$N \\geq \\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(0.90)}$$\nNow, we can compute the numerical value of the right-hand side:\n$$N \\geq \\frac{-2.99573227...}{-0.10536051...}$$\n$$N \\geq 28.4331...$$\nSince the number of nuclei counted, $N$, must be a whole number (an integer), the minimum integer value of $N$ that satisfies this condition is the next integer greater than $28.4331...$.\n$$N_{\\text{min}} = 29$$\nThus, a minimum of $29$ nuclei must be scored to ensure a detection probability of at least $95\\%$.\n\nFinally, we must justify from first principles why increasing $N$ increases the statistical power of detection. The statistical power in this context is the probability of detection, $P_D(N, p) = 1 - (1-p)^N$. To show that this power increases with $N$, we need to demonstrate that $P_D(N, p)$ is an increasing function of $N$ for a fixed $p \\in (0, 1)$.\n\nConsider the term $(1-p)^N$. Since $p$ is a fraction between $0$ and $1$, the base of the exponent, $(1-p)$, is also a number strictly between $0$ and $1$. For any such base $b \\in (0, 1)$, the function $f(N) = b^N$ is a strictly decreasing function of $N$. As $N$ increases, $b^N$ approaches $0$.\nIn our case, the term $(1-p)^N$ is a strictly decreasing function of $N$.\nThe detection probability is $P_D(N) = 1 - (1-p)^N$. As $N$ increases, $(1-p)^N$ decreases. Subtracting a smaller positive quantity from $1$ results in a larger value. Therefore, $P_D(N)$ is a strictly increasing function of $N$. As $N$ approaches infinity, $(1-p)^N$ approaches $0$, and the detection probability $P_D(N)$ approaches $1$, which is the maximum possible power. This demonstrates that increasing the sample size $N$ necessarily increases the statistical power to detect the subclonal abnormality.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{29}$$", "id": "5114991"}, {"introduction": "Once signals are counted, the raw data must be converted into a clinically meaningful metric. A common task in oncologic FISH is to assess gene amplification, but simply counting signals from the gene of interest is insufficient due to variations in chromosome number (aneuploidy).

Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) uses fluorescently labeled deoxyribonucleic acid probes that hybridize to their complementary genomic loci, and the discrete fluorescent signals counted per nucleus are interpreted as proxies for the underlying genomic copy number. To control for whole-chromosome changes (such as aneuploidy), a centromere enumeration probe (CEP) targeting the centromeric alpha-satellite of the chromosome harboring the locus is used in parallel. In a ploidy-normalization strategy, the locus-specific probe signals quantify the target’s copy number, and the centromeric control probe signals quantify the reference chromosome’s copy number; their ratio is interpreted as the locus’s relative amplification with respect to chromosome copy.\n\nUsing only these foundational principles and treating per-nucleus signal counts as realizations of random variables whose expectations represent underlying copy numbers, define a mathematically explicit copy number amplification assay readout as a dimensionless ratio based on per-nucleus counts across a batch of nuclei.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The problem accurately describes the principles of Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) for copy number analysis in cytogenetics and oncology and requests a formal mathematical definition and subsequent calculation based on provided data.\n\nThe task requires two parts: first, to define a mathematically explicit copy number amplification assay readout based on the provided principles; second, to compute this value for a specific tumor sample.\n\nLet us begin by formalizing the definition. The problem states that per-nucleus signal counts are treated as realizations of random variables. Let $L$ be the random variable representing the number of signals from the locus-specific probe in a single nucleus, and let $C$ be the random variable for the number of signals from the centromeric control probe (CEP). The problem specifies that their expectations, $E[L]$ and $E[C]$, represent the true underlying copy numbers of the locus and the reference chromosome, respectively.\n\nThe \"locus's relative amplification with respect to chromosome copy\" is defined as the ratio of these copy numbers. Thus, the true amplification ratio, which we denote as $R_{true}$, is given by:\n$$R_{true} = \\frac{E[L]}{E[C]}$$\nIn a clinical assay, we do not know the true expectations. Instead, we estimate them from a sample of cells. A batch of $N$ nuclei is scored. For each nucleus $i$, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$, we observe a locus-specific signal count, $l_i$, and a centromeric signal count, $c_i$. The sets of observations are $\\{l_1, l_2, \\dots, l_N\\}$ and $\\{c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_N\\}$.\n\nThe \"mean locus-specific probe signal count\" and \"mean centromeric control probe signal count\" are the sample means calculated from these observations. Let us denote them by $\\bar{l}$ and $\\bar{c}$, respectively.\n$$\\bar{l} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} l_i$$\n$$\\bar{c} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i$$\nThese sample means, $\\bar{l}$ and $\\bar{c}$, are unbiased estimators for the true expectations, $E[L]$ and $E[C]$. Therefore, the \"mathematically explicit copy number amplification assay readout,\" which we will denote as $R_A$, is the ratio of these sample means. This ratio serves as the empirical estimate of $R_{true}$.\n$$R_A = \\frac{\\bar{l}}{\\bar{c}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the sample means, we can also express this ratio in terms of the total counts:\n$$R_A = \\frac{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} l_i}{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} l_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i}$$\nThis definition shows that the amplification ratio is equivalent to the ratio of the total number of locus-specific signals to the total number of centromeric signals counted across all scored nuclei. This is the explicit definition requested.\n\nNow, we proceed to the second part of the task: computing the amplification ratio for the given tumor sample. The provided data are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Mean locus-specific probe signal count, $\\bar{l} = 8$.\n    \\item Mean centromeric control probe signal count, $\\bar{c} = 2$.\n    \\item Number of scored nuclei, $N = 50$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe value of $N=50$ confirms the statistical basis over which the means were calculated but is not directly needed for the final computation since the means are already provided.\n\nUsing our defined formula for the amplification ratio, $R_A$:\n$$R_A = \\frac{\\bar{l}}{\\bar{c}}$$\nWe substitute the given numerical values:\n$$R_A = \\frac{8}{2}$$\n$$R_A = 4$$\nThe resulting amplification ratio is $4$.

This high PPV demonstrates the clinical utility of the assay, particularly when applied to a population with an enriched pretest probability of $20\\%$.\n\n- **Confirmatory Testing Strategy:** While a PPV of $92.23\\%$ is high, it also implies that approximately $1 - 0.9223 = 0.0777$, or about $7.8\\%$, of positive results are false positives. Given that ALK-targeted therapies are costly and associated with potential toxicities, exposing a patient without the target mutation to such treatments is undesirable. Depending on institutional guidelines and clinical context, this level of uncertainty may or may not be acceptable. In many centers, a PPV greater than $90\\%$ would be considered sufficient to act upon. However, for a definitive diagnosis, especially in cases where other clinical or pathological features are equivocal, a confirmatory test using an orthogonal method (such as next-generation sequencing or a different immunohistochemistry clone) might be considered to resolve the small residual uncertainty.\n\n- **Targeted Therapy Initiation:** The high PPV provides strong evidence to support the initiation of ALK-targeted inhibitors (e.g., alectinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib). The assay effectively identifies a patient population highly likely to benefit from this specific class of therapy. For the majority of patients testing positive, immediate initiation of targeted therapy based on this FISH result would be a reasonable and evidence-based clinical decision, maximizing the chance of therapeutic benefit while accepting a small, quantifiable risk of a false positive result.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9223}\n$$", "id": "5115004"}]}
