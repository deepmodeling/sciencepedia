The observed isotope envelope has peaks at $m/z=699.0$, $m/z=699.5$, $m/z=700.0$, $m/z=700.5$, and $m/z=701.0$.

Report both the inferred integer charge state and the rounded neutral monoisotopic mass.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, allowing for a direct calculation based on fundamental principles of mass spectrometry.\n\nThe first step is to determine the charge state, $z$, of the peptide ion. In mass spectrometry, an isotopic cluster arises from the natural abundance of heavier isotopes, primarily Carbon-$13$ ($^{13}\\text{C}$). The mass difference between a molecule containing one $^{12}\\text{C}$ and an otherwise identical molecule containing one $^{13}\\text{C}$ is approximately $1.00335$ Daltons (Da). For practical purposes in interpreting peptide spectra, this mass difference, $\\Delta m_{\\text{isotope}}$, is approximated as $1 \\text{ Da}$.\n\nThe mass spectrometer measures the mass-to-charge ratio, $m/z$. When an ion has a charge of $z$, the separation between adjacent isotopic peaks in the $m/z$ spectrum, $\\Delta(m/z)$, is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta(m/z) = \\frac{\\Delta m_{\\text{isotope}}}{z}\n$$\nThe problem states that the observed spacing between adjacent peaks in the isotope cluster is $\\Delta(m/z) = 0.5$. Using the approximation $\\Delta m_{\\text{isotope}} \\approx 1 \\text{ Da}$, we can solve for the charge state $z$:\n$$\nz = \\frac{\\Delta m_{\\text{isotope}}}{\\Delta(m/z)} \\approx \\frac{1 \\text{ Da}}{0.5} = 2\n$$\nSince the charge state must be an integer, we can confidently infer that $z=2$. This means the peptide is in a doubly charged state, i.e., $[M+2H]^{2+}$.\n\nThe second step is to calculate the neutral monoisotopic mass, $M$, of the peptide. The mass-to-charge ratio for an ion formed by protonation is defined as:\n$$\n\\frac{m}{z} = \\frac{M + z \\cdot m_p}{z}\n$$\nwhere $M$ is the neutral monoisotopic mass of the peptide and $m_p$ is the mass of a proton.\n\nThe problem provides the $m/z$ value for the monoisotopic peak, which is the peak with the lowest mass in the cluster. This peak corresponds to the molecule containing no heavy isotopes. The value is given as $(\\frac{m}{z})_{\\text{mono}} = 699.0$. We are also given $m_p = 1.007276 \\text{ Da}$ and have determined that $z=2$.\n\nWe can substitute these values into the equation and solve for $M$:\n$$\n699.0 = \\frac{M + 2 \\cdot (1.007276)}{2}\n$$\nTo solve for $M$, we first multiply both sides by $z=2$:\n$$\n2 \\cdot 699.0 = M + 2 \\cdot (1.007276)\n$$\n$$\n1398.0 = M + 2.014552\n$$\nNow, we isolate $M$ by subtracting the mass of the two protons:\n$$\nM = 1398.0 - 2.014552\n$$\n$$\nM = 1395.985448 \\text{ Da}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final neutral monoisotopic mass to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $1395.985448$ has its first four significant figures as $1$, $3$, $9$, and $5$. The fifth significant figure is $9$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\nM \\approx 1396 \\text{ Da}\n$$\nTherefore, the inferred charge state is $z=2$, and the estimated neutral monoisotopic mass is $1396 \\text{ Da}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 1396\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5150342"}, {"introduction": "After a database search engine matches thousands of tandem mass spectra to peptide sequences, a critical question arises: how many of these identifications are correct?

Do not report a percentage and do not include any units.", "solution": "The problem requires a three-part answer: the derivation of a False Discovery Rate (FDR) estimator, the calculation of this FDR for a given dataset, and a qualitative explanation of the effects of changing the score cutoff on sensitivity and specificity.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the FDR Estimator\n\nThe False Discovery Rate (FDR) is defined as the expected proportion of false discoveries (false positives) among all accepted discoveries. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\text{FDR} = E\\left[\\frac{V}{R}\\right]\n$$\nwhere $V$ is the number of false discoveries (false positives) and $R$ is the total number of accepted discoveries. In the context of shotgun proteomics and a target-decoy database search, the \"discoveries\" are the set of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) from the target database that are accepted based on a score cutoff.\n\nLet $T$ be the number of accepted target PSMs at a given score cutoff. This is the total number of reported discoveries, so $R = T$.\nThe number of accepted target PSMs, $T$, is composed of true positive target matches ($TP_T$) and false positive target matches ($FP_T$):\n$$\nT = TP_T + FP_T\n$$\nThe number of false discoveries, $V$, is the number of false positive target matches, $FP_T$. The core challenge is to estimate $FP_T$ without knowing the ground truth.\n\nThe problem states that a concatenated target-decoy database is used, with equal-sized target and decoy spaces. It also provides the central assumption of the target-decoy approach: \"decoy acceptances model the behavior of false target acceptances due to the symmetry of incorrect matches across target and decoy sequences.\" This means that the number of incorrect PSMs matched to the decoy database is a good estimator for the number of incorrect PSMs matched to the target database.\n\nLet $D$ be the number of accepted decoy PSMs at the same score cutoff. Since all decoy sequences are, by definition, not present in the sample, any match to a decoy sequence is a false positive. Therefore, the number of accepted decoy PSMs, $D$, provides a direct estimate for the number of false positives we would expect from a database of incorrect sequences of that size.\n\nGiven that the target and decoy databases are of equal size, the number of false positives in the target set, $FP_T$, is estimated to be equal to the number of false positives in the decoy set, which is simply $D$.\n$$\n\\widehat{FP_T} = D\n$$\nAn estimator for the FDR, denoted as $\\widehat{\\text{FDR}}$, can be constructed by replacing the terms in the definition with their observed counts or estimates:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{FDR}} = \\frac{\\widehat{V}}{\\widehat{R}} = \\frac{\\widehat{FP_T}}{T}\n$$\nSubstituting our estimate for $FP_T$, we arrive at the estimator for peptide-level FDR in terms of the number of accepted target PSMs ($T$) and accepted decoy PSMs ($D$):\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{FDR}} = \\frac{D}{T}\n$$\nThis is the simple target-decoy FDR estimator, which adheres to all the assumptions given in the problem statement.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of the Estimated FDR\n\nThe problem provides the following observed values at a particular score cutoff:\n- Number of accepted target PSMs, $T = 1000$.\n- Number of accepted decoy PSMs, $D = 20$.\n\nUsing the derived estimator:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{FDR}} = \\frac{D}{T} = \\frac{20}{1000} = 0.02\n$$\nThe problem requires this result to be expressed in scientific notation rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n0.02 = 2.00 \\times 10^{-2}\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Qualitative Explanation of Sensitivity and Specificity\n\nIn the context of PSM identification, sensitivity and specificity are defined as follows:\n- A \"Positive\" is a peptide that is truly present in the sample and generated the spectrum. A \"Negative\" is an incorrect peptide assignment for a spectrum.\n- **Sensitivity** (or True Positive Rate) is the proportion of truly present peptides that are correctly identified (i.e., accepted with a score above the cutoff). It is calculated as $\\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$, where $TP$ are True Positives and $FN$ are False Negatives (correct peptide matches that are rejected for having a score below the cutoff). High sensitivity means a high fraction of correct peptides are found.\n- **Specificity** (or True Negative Rate) is the proportion of incorrect peptide assignments that are correctly rejected (i.e., have a score below the cutoff). It is calculated as $\\frac{TN}{TN + FP}$, where $TN$ are True Negatives (incorrect matches that are correctly rejected) and $FP$ are False Positives (incorrect matches that are accepted). High specificity means a low fraction of incorrect peptides are accepted.\n\nThe score cutoff creates a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity:\n\n- **Making the score cutoff more stringent (increasing the threshold):**\n  - Fewer PSMs (both target and decoy) will be accepted. This reduces the number of False Positives ($FP$), as more low-scoring, incorrect matches are correctly rejected. The number of True Negatives ($TN$) increases. Consequently, **specificity increases**.\n  - However, some correct PSMs with scores that are now below the new, higher threshold will be rejected. This increases the number of False Negatives ($FN$). The number of True Positives ($TP$) decreases. Consequently, **sensitivity decreases**.\n  - This leads to a lower $\\widehat{\\text{FDR}}$ but fewer overall identifications.\n\n- **Making the score cutoff more permissive (decreasing the threshold):**\n  - More PSMs (both target and decoy) will be accepted. This increases the number of False Positives ($FP$), as more low-scoring, incorrect matches are now accepted. The number of True Negatives ($TN$) decreases. Consequently, **specificity decreases**.\n  - More correct PSMs with lower scores will now be accepted, reducing the number of False Negatives ($FN$). The number of True Positives ($TP$) increases. Consequently, **sensitivity increases**.\n  - This leads to a higher $\\widehat{\\text{FDR}}$ but more overall identifications, including recovery of weaker but correct signals.\n\nIn summary, a more stringent cutoff favors high confidence and high specificity at the cost of lower sensitivity (fewer discoveries). A more permissive cutoff favors high sensitivity (more discoveries) at the cost of lower specificity and a higher rate of false discoveries.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.00 \\times 10^{-2}}$$", "id": "5150289"}, {"introduction": "Quantitative proteomics aims to accurately measure changes in protein abundance, but instrumental artifacts can distort the true biological ratios.

In a standard tandem mass spectrometry experiment (MS2), a precursor ion isolation window is selected in the first mass analyzer. This window contains the target peptide ions and, due to finite resolution, co-isolated interfering ions. All ions within this window are fragmented simultaneously, and the low-mass reporter ions are measured. The signal from the contaminants' reporter ions mixes with the signal from the target's reporter ions, introducing the ratio distortion calculated above.\n\nThe SPS-MS3 method adds a third stage of mass analysis to purify the signal. The workflow is as follows:\n1.  **MS1:** Precursor ions are scanned, and a target precursor is selected for fragmentation.\n2.  **MS2:** The selected precursor window (containing the target peptide and contaminants) is fragmented. Instead of measuring reporter ions, the instrument identifies several high-mass, characteristic fragment ions (e.g., b- or y-ions) that are unique to the target peptide's sequence.\n3.  **MS3:** These specific fragment ions from the target peptide are co-isolated together using the Synchronous Precursor Selection technique. All other ions, including fragments from the co-isolated contaminants, are discarded.\n4.  **Fragmentation and Detection:** The isolated pool of target-specific fragment ions is then subjected to a final round of fragmentation. This fragmentation releases the TMT reporter ions. Because the precursors for this final fragmentation stage originated exclusively from the target peptide, the resulting reporter ion intensities are free from the interference of the initially co-isolated contaminants.\n\nThe limiting ratio that would be observed if contaminant contributions were completely eliminated, as is the ideal goal of SPS-MS3, corresponds to the case where the fraction of contaminants $f = 0$. In this scenario, the observed ratio $R_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ becomes:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{obs}} (f=0) = \\frac{(1-0) \\frac{4}{5} + \\frac{0}{2}}{(1-0) \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{0}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{5}}{\\frac{1}{5}} = 4\n$$\nThus, by completely eliminating contaminant contributions, the SPS-MS3 method recovers the true biological ratio of $4:1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{71}{29}}\n$$", "id": "5150272"}]}
