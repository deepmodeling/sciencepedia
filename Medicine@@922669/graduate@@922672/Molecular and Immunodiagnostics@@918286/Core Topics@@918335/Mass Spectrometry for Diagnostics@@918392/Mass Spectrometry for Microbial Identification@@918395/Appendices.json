I will proceed with the detailed solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested: first, the derivation of the flight time as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio, and second, the calculation of the flight time difference.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Flight Time**\n\nAn ion of mass $m$ and charge $q$ is accelerated from rest (since initial kinetic energy is negligible) through an electric potential difference $V$. According to the principle of conservation of energy, the potential energy lost by the ion is converted into kinetic energy.\n\nThe potential energy lost is $qV$. The kinetic energy gained is $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $v$ is the final velocity of the ion after acceleration.\n$$qV = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$\nWe can solve this equation for the velocity $v$:\n$$v^2 = \\frac{2qV}{m}$$\n$$v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2qV}{m}}$$\nAfter acceleration, the ion enters a field-free drift region of length $L$. In this region, its velocity $v$ is constant. The time $t$ it takes to traverse this region, known as the time of flight, is given by:\n$$t = \\frac{L}{v}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v$ into the equation for $t$:\n$$t = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2qV}{m}}} = L\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2qV}}$$\nThe mass-to-charge ratio is defined as $\\rho = m/q$. We can express the flight time $t$ as a function of $\\rho$:\n$$t = L\\sqrt{\\frac{m/q}{2V}} = L\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho}{2V}}$$\nThis can be rewritten to show the functional dependency more clearly:\n$$t = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2V}}\\sqrt{\\rho}$$\nThis is the desired derivation, showing that the flight time $t$ is proportional to the square root of the mass-to-charge ratio $\\rho = m/q$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Flight Time Difference**\n\nWe are given two populations of singly charged ions. Let's denote their properties with subscripts $1$ and $2$.\n- For both populations, the charge is the elementary charge: $q_1 = q_2 = e$.\n- The mass-to-charge ratios are given in Thomson (Th). Let $\\mu_1 = 5{,}000$ and $\\mu_2 = 5{,}100$ be the numerical values of the $m/z$ ratios.\n- The unit definition $1\\,\\mathrm{Th} = 1\\,\\mathrm{Da}/e$ means the physical mass-to-charge ratio $\\rho$ is given by $\\rho = \\mu \\times (1\\,\\mathrm{Da}/e)$. Let $u$ represent the mass of $1\\,\\mathrm{Da}$ in kilograms. So, $\\rho = \\mu \\frac{u}{e}$.\n\nThe flight times for the two ion populations are:\n$$t_1 = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2V}}\\sqrt{\\rho_1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t_2 = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2V}}\\sqrt{\\rho_2}$$\nThe difference in flight times, $\\Delta t$, is:\n$$\\Delta t = t_2 - t_1 = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2V}}(\\sqrt{\\rho_2} - \\sqrt{\\rho_1})$$\nSince $\\rho = \\mu \\frac{u}{e}$, we can substitute this into the expression for $\\Delta t$:\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2V}}\\left(\\sqrt{\\mu_2 \\frac{u}{e}} - \\sqrt{\\mu_1 \\frac{u}{e}}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2V}}\\sqrt{\\frac{u}{e}}(\\sqrt{\\mu_2} - \\sqrt{\\mu_1})$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n- $L=1.5\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $V=20 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $\\mu_1=5{,}000$\n- $\\mu_2=5{,}100$\n- $u = 1.66053906660\\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $e = 1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n\nLet's calculate the terms:\nThe constant factor:\n$$\\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2V}}\\sqrt{\\frac{u}{e}} = \\frac{1.5}{\\sqrt{2 \\times 20 \\times 10^3}} \\sqrt{\\frac{1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27}}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}}}$$\n$$\\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2V}}\\sqrt{\\frac{u}{e}} = \\frac{1.5}{\\sqrt{4 \\times 10^4}} \\sqrt{1.03642699 \\times 10^{-8}} = \\frac{1.5}{200} \\times (1.01805058 \\times 10^{-4})$$\n$$= (7.5 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (1.01805058 \\times 10^{-4}) \\approx 7.63537937 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe mass-dependent term:\n$$\\sqrt{\\mu_2} - \\sqrt{\\mu_1} = \\sqrt{5100} - \\sqrt{5000} \\approx 71.414284 - 70.710678 = 0.703606$$\nNow, we compute the product:\n$$\\Delta t \\approx (7.63537937 \\times 10^{-7}) \\times (0.703606) \\approx 5.372302 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in nanoseconds ($1\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}$).\n$$\\Delta t \\approx (5.372302 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\times \\frac{10^9\\,\\mathrm{ns}}{1\\,\\mathrm{s}} \\approx 537.2302\\,\\mathrm{ns}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $537.2\\,\\mathrm{ns}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{537.2}$$", "id": "4662206"}, {"introduction": "Following the separation of ions, the next critical task is to assess the quality of the measurement.
