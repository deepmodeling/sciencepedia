From $\\mathrm{C1}$ to $\\mathrm{C2}$, the distribution shifts to lower charge states (for example, from predominantly $+3/+2$ to $+2/+1$) with a concomitant increase in $m/z$, because higher $\\mathrm{pH}$ reduces the fraction of protonated sites on peptides and higher ACN reduces solution surface tension, lowering the droplet charge capacity.\n\nB. From $\\mathrm{C1}$ to $\\mathrm{C2}$, the distribution shifts to higher charge states (for example, from predominantly $+2$ to $+3/+4$) with a concomitant decrease in $m/z$, because increased organic content enhances desolvation and exposes basic residues, increasing the number of acquired protons.\n\nC. There is no significant shift in charge states or $m/z$ between $\\mathrm{C1}$ and $\\mathrm{C2}$, because tryptic peptides have an intrinsic charge determined by sequence and are unaffected by $\\mathrm{pH}$ or organic content under positive-ion ESI.\n\nD.

Glutamic acid similarly is neutral at $\\mathrm{pH}\\,\\,2.7$ and negatively charged at $\\mathrm{pH}\\,\\,8.0$.\n\nConsequently, moving from $\\mathrm{C1}$ $\\left(\\mathrm{pH}\\,\\,2.7\\right)$ to $\\mathrm{C2}$ $\\left(\\mathrm{pH}\\,\\,8.0\\right)$, the net positive charge capacity of tryptic peptides decreases: histidines lose protonation, the N-terminus is partly deprotonated, and acidic residues become negatively charged, which offsets positive charges. Even though lysine and arginine remain protonated, the total number of positive charges a peptide can stably carry in solution decreases on average.\n\nSecond, consider electrospray charging governed by the Rayleigh limit for a droplet of radius $r$ and surface tension $\\gamma$, with vacuum permittivity $\\varepsilon_0$. The maximum stable droplet charge is\n$$\nq_R=8\\pi\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_0\\gamma r^3}.\n$$\nThus, $q_R\\propto \\sqrt{\\gamma}$. Increasing ACN fraction from $5\\%$ to $50\\%$ reduces the solution surface tension from approximately that of water $\\left(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{water}}\\approx 72\\,\\mathrm{mN\\,m^{-1}}\\right)$ to a lower value characteristic of water/ACN mixtures $\\left(\\gamma_{50\\%\\,\\mathrm{ACN}}\\approx 30\\text{ to }40\\,\\mathrm{mN\\,m^{-1}}\\right)$. Taking a representative comparison $\\gamma_{50\\%\\,\\mathrm{ACN}}\\approx 30\\,\\mathrm{mN\\,m^{-1}}$ gives\n$$\n\\frac{q_{R,\\,50\\%\\,\\mathrm{ACN}}}{q_{R,\\,5\\%\\,\\mathrm{ACN}}}\\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{30}{72}}\\approx \\sqrt{0.4167}\\approx 0.646.\n$$\nTherefore, the maximum droplet charge prior to Coulombic fission decreases as ACN increases. Because the average analyte charge $z$ scales with the available excess charge in progenitor droplets during the charged residue or ion evaporation process, a decrease in $\\gamma$ tends to lower the observed analyte charge states.\n\nCombining these two principles: higher $\\mathrm{pH}$ reduces the number of protonated sites and introduces negatively charged acidic residues, while higher ACN reduces droplet charge capacity. Both effects drive the precursor charge-state distribution toward lower $z$ values, which shifts $m/z$ peaks to higher values because\n$$\n\\frac{m}{z}=\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{neutral}}+z\\,m_p}{z},\n$$\nwith $m_{\\mathrm{neutral}}$ the neutral mass and $m_p$ the proton mass. For illustration, take a peptide with $m_{\\mathrm{neutral}}=2000\\,\\mathrm{Da}$. At $z=3$, \n$$\n\\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_{z=3}=\\frac{2000+3\\times 1}{3}\\approx 667\\,\\mathrm{Th},\n$$\nwhile at $z=2$,\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_{z=2}=\\frac{2000+2\\times 1}{2}\\approx 1001\\,\\mathrm{Th}.\n$$\nA decrease in charge thus increases $m/z$.\n\nWe now evaluate each option:\n\nA. This states that from $\\mathrm{C1}$ to $\\mathrm{C2}$ there is a shift to lower charge states with increased $m/z$, attributed to fewer protonated sites at higher $\\mathrm{pH}$ and reduced surface tension at higher ACN. This is consistent with the acid-base analysis (loss of histidine protonation, partial deprotonation of the N-terminus, deprotonation of acidic residues) and with the Rayleigh limit scaling $q_R\\propto \\sqrt{\\gamma}$ leading to fewer available charges for transfer to analytes. This option correctly predicts both direction and rationale. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. This claims a shift to higher charge states due to better desolvation and exposure of basic sites at higher organic. While increased organic content can enhance desolvation, for peptides the dominating effects are the reduced surface tension lowering the droplet charge capacity and the higher $\\mathrm{pH}$ reducing net protonation. Furthermore, short tryptic peptides do not undergo significant conformational unfolding analogous to intact proteins; the “supercharging by unfolding” argument does not generally apply to digests without specific supercharging additives. The net effect is not an increase in charge. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. This asserts no significant shift, implying invariance to $\\mathrm{pH}$ and organic content. This contradicts both acid-base equilibria, which directly alter site protonation and net charge, and electrospray physics, where surface tension modulates the Rayleigh limit and, consequently, charge transfer. Empirically and mechanistically, charge states and $m/z$ do shift under these conditions. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This suggests a broader distribution with unchanged mean due to cancellation of opposing effects. However, the two effects do not cancel in sign; both higher $\\mathrm{pH}$ and higher ACN act in the same direction to lower charge. Therefore, the mean charge state is expected to decrease, not remain unchanged, and $m/z$ should increase on average. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best prediction is a shift to lower charge states and higher $m/z$ in $\\mathrm{C2}$ relative to $\\mathrm{C1}$ for a monoclonal antibody digest under the stated conditions, for the stated first-principles reasons.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5111962"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative analysis to robust quantification requires careful optimization of instrument parameters, especially in complex multiplexed assays.
