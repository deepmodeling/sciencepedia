The Beer–Lambert law states that $A=\\varepsilon c \\ell$, where $A$ is absorbance, $\\varepsilon$ is the molar absorptivity, $c$ is the molar concentration, and $\\ell$ is the optical pathlength.

Do not compute a numerical uncertainty; state the first-order relationship symbolically.", "solution": "The problem asks for the concentration of oxidized TMB in a microplate well, based on a spectrophotometric measurement. The governing principle is the Beer–Lambert law, which relates absorbance to concentration.\n\nFirst, the validity of the problem statement is established.\nThe givens are:\n- The Beer–Lambert law: $A=\\varepsilon c \\ell$\n- Measured absorbance: $A=0.35$\n- Molar absorptivity of oxidized TMB at the measurement wavelength: $\\varepsilon=59,000\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n- Effective optical pathlength: $\\ell = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it is based on the fundamental Beer–Lambert law and standard practices in immunodiagnostics (ELISA). The provided values for absorbance, pathlength, and molar absorptivity are physically realistic for such an assay. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to calculate the unknown concentration. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe first step is to derive the expression for the molar concentration, $c$, from the Beer–Lambert law. Starting with the given equation:\n$$A = \\varepsilon c \\ell$$\nTo solve for $c$, we divide both sides of the equation by the product of the molar absorptivity, $\\varepsilon$, and the optical pathlength, $\\ell$:\n$$\\frac{A}{\\varepsilon \\ell} = \\frac{\\varepsilon c \\ell}{\\varepsilon \\ell}$$\nThis simplifies to the desired expression for concentration:\n$$c = \\frac{A}{\\varepsilon \\ell}$$\nNext, we substitute the provided numerical values into this derived expression. The given values are $A=0.35$ (dimensionless), $\\varepsilon=59,000\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and $\\ell=0.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n$$c = \\frac{0.35}{(59,000\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) (0.5\\,\\mathrm{cm})}$$\nEvaluating the denominator first:\n$$(59,000\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) (0.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}) = 29,500\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}$$\nNow, we compute the concentration:\n$$c = \\frac{0.35}{29,500\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}} \\approx 1.18644 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe units are consistent, as $\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{M}^{-1}} = \\mathrm{M}$ (moles per liter). The problem requires the concentration to be expressed in micromolar ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$). The conversion factor is $1\\,\\mathrm{M} = 10^6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n$$c = (1.18644 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}) \\times \\left(\\frac{10^6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{1\\,\\mathrm{M}}\\right) = 11.8644\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe final step in this calculation is to round the answer to three significant figures, as specified. The given values $A=0.35$ and $\\ell=0.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ have two significant figures, and $\\varepsilon=59,000\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ also has two. However, the problem explicitly requests rounding to three significant figures. Adhering to this instruction:\n$$c \\approx 11.9\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nFinally, the problem asks for a justification of how uncertainties in the effective pathlength, $\\ell$, propagate to the inferred concentration, $c$. We are to treat $A$ and $\\varepsilon$ as exact constants for this analysis. The relationship between $c$ and $\\ell$ is $c = \\frac{A}{\\varepsilon \\ell} = \\left(\\frac{A}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\\ell^{-1}$.\n\nTo determine the first-order propagation of uncertainty, we use differential calculus. The uncertainty in $c$, denoted $\\delta c$, resulting from a small uncertainty in $\\ell$, denoted $\\delta\\ell$, is approximated by:\n$$\\delta c \\approx \\left| \\frac{dc}{d\\ell} \\right| \\delta\\ell$$\nWe compute the derivative of $c$ with respect to $\\ell$:\n$$\\frac{dc}{d\\ell} = \\frac{d}{d\\ell} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{A}{\\varepsilon} \\right) \\ell^{-1} \\right] = \\left( \\frac{A}{\\varepsilon} \\right) (-1)\\ell^{-2} = -\\frac{A}{\\varepsilon \\ell^2}$$\nSubstituting this into the uncertainty propagation formula:\n$$\\delta c \\approx \\left| -\\frac{A}{\\varepsilon \\ell^2} \\right| \\delta\\ell = \\frac{A}{\\varepsilon \\ell^2} \\delta\\ell$$\nThis expression shows the relationship for the absolute uncertainty. It is often more insightful to examine the relative (or fractional) uncertainty, $\\frac{\\delta c}{c}$. Dividing the expression for $\\delta c$ by the expression for $c$:\n$$\\frac{\\delta c}{c} \\approx \\frac{\\frac{A}{\\varepsilon \\ell^2} \\delta\\ell}{\\frac{A}{\\varepsilon \\ell}}$$\nSimplifying this fraction gives the symbolic relationship:\n$$\\frac{\\delta c}{c} \\approx \\frac{\\delta\\ell}{\\ell}$$\nThis relationship symbolically justifies how uncertainty in $\\ell$ propagates to $c$. It states that, to a first-order approximation, the relative uncertainty in the calculated concentration is equal to the relative uncertainty in the effective pathlength. Therefore, factors that affect $\\ell$, such as meniscus curvature, well-to-well variations, and plate tilt, will introduce a directly proportional relative error in the final calculated concentration. For instance, a $2\\%$ uncertainty in the pathlength would lead to a $2\\%$ uncertainty in the concentration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11.9}$$", "id": "5121757"}, {"introduction": "While colorimetric assays are robust, detecting analytes at very low concentrations often requires the superior sensitivity of chemiluminescence.
