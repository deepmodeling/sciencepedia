It is a well-defined problem in applied mathematics relevant to its specified domain.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nLet $N_{u,k}$ be the number of unbound reporters remaining in the well after the $k$-th wash cycle. The initial number of unbound reporters, before any washes, is $N_{u,0}$.\nLet $f_r$ be the fraction of unbound reporters removed in a single wash cycle. The problem states $f_r = 0.9$.\nTherefore, the fraction of unbound reporters that *remains* after a single wash is $f_k = 1 - f_r = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1$.\n\nThe number of unbound reporters after the first wash ($k=1$) is:\n$$N_{u,1} = N_{u,0} \\times (1 - f_r) = N_{u,0} \\times 0.1$$\nThe number of unbound reporters after the second wash ($k=2$) is found by applying the same fractional removal to the reporters present after the first wash:\n$$N_{u,2} = N_{u,1} \\times (1 - f_r) = (N_{u,0} \\times 0.1) \\times 0.1 = N_{u,0} \\times (0.1)^2$$\nThis establishes a geometric progression. Following this logic, the number of unbound reporters remaining after $n$ identical wash cycles, $N_{u,n}$, is given by:\n$$N_{u,n} = N_{u,0} \\times (1 - f_r)^n = N_{u,0} \\times (0.1)^n$$\n\n**1. Residual Unbound Reporter Fraction**\nThe first required expression is the residual fraction of unbound reporters relative to the initial amount $N_{u,0}$ after $n$ washes. This fraction, which we can denote as $F_u$, is the ratio of $N_{u,n}$ to $N_{u,0}$.\n$$F_u(n) = \\frac{N_{u,n}}{N_{u,0}} = \\frac{N_{u,0} \\times (0.1)^n}{N_{u,0}}$$\n$$F_u(n) = (0.1)^n$$\nThis is the expression for the residual unbound reporter fraction after $n$ washes.\n\n**2. Fraction of Total Signal from Residual Unbound Reporters**\nThe problem states that the signal is proportional to the total number of labeled reporters present in the well at the time of measurement. Let the proportionality constant be $ S_p $, representing the signal per reporter.\n\nAfter $n$ washes, the number of bound reporters remains $N_b$, as they are stably bound. The number of unbound reporters is $N_{u,n}$.\nThe total number of reporters in the well is $N_{total,n} = N_b + N_{u,n}$.\nThe total signal is $S_{total,n} = S_p \\times N_{total,n} = S_p (N_b + N_{u,n})$.\nThe signal generated by the residual unbound reporters is $S_{unbound,n} = S_p \\times N_{u,n}$.\n\nThe fraction of the total signal attributable to residual unbound reporters, which we denote as $F_s$, is the ratio of $S_{unbound,n}$ to $S_{total,n}$:\n$$F_s(n, r) = \\frac{S_{unbound,n}}{S_{total,n}} = \\frac{S_p \\times N_{u,n}}{S_p (N_b + N_{u,n})} = \\frac{N_{u,n}}{N_b + N_{u,n}}$$\nTo express this in terms of $n$ and $r \\equiv N_{u,0}/N_{b}$, we first substitute the expression for $N_{u,n}$:\n$$F_s(n, r) = \\frac{N_{u,0} (0.1)^n}{N_b + N_{u,0} (0.1)^n}$$\nNow, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by $N_b$ to introduce the ratio $r$:\n$$F_s(n, r) = \\frac{\\frac{N_{u,0}}{N_b} (0.1)^n}{\\frac{N_b}{N_b} + \\frac{N_{u,0}}{N_b} (0.1)^n} = \\frac{r (0.1)^n}{1 + r (0.1)^n}$$\nThis is the expression for the fraction of total signal from unbound reporters.\n\n**Evaluation for $n=3$ and $r=100$**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate both derived expressions for the specific case where $n=3$ and $r=100$.\n\n1.  **Residual Unbound Reporter Fraction:**\n    $$F_u(n=3) = (0.1)^3 = \\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{1000}$$\n\n2.  **Fraction of Total Signal from Unbound Reporters:**\n    $$F_s(n=3, r=100) = \\frac{100 \\times (0.1)^3}{1 + 100 \\times (0.1)^3}$$\n    First, we evaluate the term $100 \\times (0.1)^3$:\n    $$100 \\times (0.1)^3 = 100 \\times \\frac{1}{1000} = \\frac{100}{1000} = \\frac{1}{10}$$\n    Now, substitute this back into the expression for $F_s$:\n    $$F_s(n=3, r=100) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{10}}{1 + \\frac{1}{10}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{10}}{\\frac{11}{10}} = \\frac{1}{11}$$\n\nThe two values, expressed as exact fractions, are $\\frac{1}{1000}$ and $\\frac{1}{11}$.\nThe final answer must be reported as a row matrix containing these two entries in the specified order.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{1000} & \\frac{1}{11}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5102958"}, {"introduction": "Beyond physical separation, the accuracy of an immunoassay hinges on its chemical specificity—the ability to bind only the intended target analyte.
