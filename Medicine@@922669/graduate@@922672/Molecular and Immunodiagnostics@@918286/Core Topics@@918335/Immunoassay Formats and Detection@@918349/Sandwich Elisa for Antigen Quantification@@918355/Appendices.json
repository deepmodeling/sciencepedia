It describes a standard and routine quality control procedure for a widely used immunodiagnostic assay (ELISA). The use of mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation to assess replicate precision is fundamental in analytical chemistry and biochemistry. The stated OD values are within a typical linear range for such an assay, and the $10\\%$ CV threshold is a common, realistic acceptance limit.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (the three OD values) and explicitly states the statistical definitions to be used (arithmetic mean and unbiased sample standard deviation). The instructions are clear and lead to a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, technical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nLet the set of triplicate OD measurements be denoted by $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$, where $x_1 = 0.52$, $x_2 = 0.48$, and $x_3 = 0.50$. The number of replicates is $n=3$.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the arithmetic mean ($\\bar{x}$) of the OD values. The formula for the arithmetic mean is:\n$$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{3} (0.52 + 0.48 + 0.50) = \\frac{1.50}{3} = 0.50 $$\nThe mean OD is $0.50$.\n\nThe second step is to calculate the unbiased sample standard deviation ($s$). The formula for the unbiased sample standard deviation uses a denominator of $n-1$ to correct for the bias inherent in using the sample mean:\n$$ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} $$\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the squared differences from the mean:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = (0.52 - 0.50)^2 + (0.48 - 0.50)^2 + (0.50 - 0.50)^2 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = (0.02)^2 + (-0.02)^2 + (0)^2 = 0.0004 + 0.0004 + 0 = 0.0008 $$\nNow, we calculate the sample variance ($s^2$):\n$$ s^2 = \\frac{0.0008}{n-1} = \\frac{0.0008}{3-1} = \\frac{0.0008}{2} = 0.0004 $$\nThe sample standard deviation ($s$) is the square root of the variance:\n$$ s = \\sqrt{0.0004} = 0.02 $$\nThe standard deviation of the triplicates is $0.02$.\n\nThe third step is to calculate the Coefficient of Variation (CV). The CV is a standardized measure of dispersion, defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the absolute value of the mean. It is typically expressed as a percentage, but the problem requests a decimal fraction.\n$$ \\text{CV} = \\frac{s}{|\\bar{x}|} $$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $s$ and $\\bar{x}$:\n$$ \\text{CV} = \\frac{0.02}{|0.50|} = \\frac{0.02}{0.50} = 0.04 $$\n\nThe final step is to compare the calculated CV with the acceptance criterion. The criterion is $\\text{CV} \\le 10\\%$, which is equivalent to $\\text{CV} \\le 0.10$.\nOur calculated value is $\\text{CV} = 0.04$.\nSince $0.04 \\le 0.10$, the replicate variability meets the stated acceptance criterion.\n\nThe problem asks for the CV as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $0.04$. To express this with four significant figures, we add trailing zeros. The first significant figure is the $4$. Therefore, we write the number as $0.04000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.04000}$$", "id": "5159227"}, {"introduction": "Beyond precision, an assay must be accurate, especially when measuring analytes in complex biological matrices like serum.

In the low-occupancy, non-saturating regime of antigen binding to the capture and detection antibodies, the measured signal is empirically observed to be proportional to antigen concentration, and thus concentration estimates derived from the calibration curve are expected to be additive under spiking when matrix effects are negligible. To assess matrix effects, a spike-recovery experiment is performed: an aliquot of serum with an endogenous antigen level is split into two portions, one unspiked and one spiked with a known concentration. Concentrations are estimated by applying the same calibration and assay conditions to both aliquots. The spiked aliquot is reported after subtracting the baseline endogenous concentration of the unspiked aliquot. Let the known spike be $C_{\\text{spike}}$ and the baseline-subtracted recovered concentration be $C_{\\text{rec}}$.

The provided values are realistic for such an assay. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided and no contradictory statements. The terminology is precise and objective. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe goal is to compute the \"percent recovery as a unitless decimal,\" which is equivalent to the fractional recovery, denoted here as $R$. The fractional recovery quantifies how much of the known added analyte (the spike) is successfully measured (recovered) by the assay in the presence of the sample matrix (serum). It is calculated as the ratio of the measured concentration of the spike to the known concentration of the spike.\n\nThe problem states that $C_{\\text{rec}}$ is the \"baseline-subtracted measured concentration in the spiked aliquot.\" This means that the endogenous antigen concentration originally present in the unspiked serum has already been subtracted from the total concentration measured in the spiked sample. Thus, $C_{\\text{rec}}$ represents the measured concentration attributable solely to the added spike.\n\nThe formula for the fractional recovery $R$ is therefore:\n$$R = \\frac{C_{\\text{rec}}}{C_{\\text{spike}}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n$$C_{\\text{rec}} = 1.6\\ \\mathrm{ng/mL}$$\n$$C_{\\text{spike}} = 2\\ \\mathrm{ng/mL}$$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$R = \\frac{1.6\\ \\mathrm{ng/mL}}{2\\ \\mathrm{ng/mL}} = 0.8$$\n\nThe problem requires the numerical answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.8$ has one significant figure. To express this value with four significant figures, we must add trailing zeros after the decimal point.\n$$R = 0.8000$$\n\nNext, we must determine if this recovery is acceptable. The stated criterion for an acceptable recovery is a fractional recovery that lies within the range $0.80$ to $1.20$. In mathematical notation, the recovery $R$ is acceptable if:\n$$0.80 \\le R \\le 1.20$$\n\nOur calculated fractional recovery is $R = 0.8000$. Comparing this value to the acceptance range:\n$$0.80 \\le 0.8000 \\le 1.20$$\nThis inequality is true. The calculated recovery of $0.8000$ falls at the lower boundary of the acceptable range. Therefore, based on the provided criterion, the result is considered acceptable.\n\nThe final answer is the unitless decimal value for the fractional recovery, rounded to four significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8000}$$", "id": "5159231"}, {"introduction": "After confirming data precision and assay accuracy, the final step is to convert the measured signal into a meaningful concentration. This problem delves into the mathematical heart of ELISA data analysis by focusing on the four-parameter logistic (4PL) model [@problem_id:5159242]. By deriving the inverse formula to solve for concentration $x$ from a given signal $y$, you will gain a deeper understanding of how calibration curves are used to quantify unknown samples, moving beyond the \"black box\" of analysis software.", "problem": "In a quantitative Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for antigen measurement using a sandwich format, the calibration curve relating antigen concentration $x$ to the mean optical density signal $y$ is empirically modeled by the four-parameter logistic (4PL) function, a well-tested sigmoidal relation widely used in immunoassay calibration.

In a valid sandwich assay operated within its non-hook dynamic range, assume $A  B$, $C  0$, and $D \\neq 0$, and that the mapping from $x$ to $y$ is strictly monotone on the intended quantification interval so that each admissible $y$ corresponds to a unique $x$.\n\nStarting only from the stated 4PL definition and the monotonicity and domain assumptions above, derive an explicit algebraic expression for the inverse mapping $x(y)$ that expresses the concentration $x$ as a function of the observed signal $y$ and the fitted parameters $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. Justify the admissible domain of $y$ under which the inverse is real and unique in this model. Finally, briefly explain, at a methodological level, why numerical root-finding would be required to obtain $x$ from $y$ in practical extensions where a closed-form inversion is not attainable (for example, when the calibration model is modified by additive cross-reactivity terms or when the dynamic range exhibits non-monotonicity due to a high-dose hook effect).\n\nReport only the algebraic inverse expression for $x$ as your final boxed answer. Do not include units in your boxed answer. If you introduce any auxiliary constants in your derivation, clearly define them in terms of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $y$.

The model is given by:\n$$\ny(x) = A + \\frac{B - A}{1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{D}}\n$$\nThe parameters $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are constants, with the constraints $A  B$, $C  0$, and $D \\neq 0$. The mapping from $x$ to $y$ is assumed to be strictly monotone, ensuring a unique inverse exists.\n\nTo find the inverse function $x(y)$, we must algebraically rearrange the equation to express $x$ in terms of $y$, $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n\nFirst, we isolate the fractional term by subtracting $A$ from both sides of the equation:\n$$\ny - A = \\frac{B - A}{1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{D}}\n$$\nFor this step to be meaningful, $y$ must differ from $A$. As we will see, the valid domain for $y$ is the open interval $(A, B)$, so this condition is met.\n\nNext, we isolate the denominator containing $x$. We can achieve this by multiplying both sides by $1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{D}$ and dividing by $(y - A)$:\n$$\n1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{D} = \\frac{B - A}{y - A}\n$$\nThis step is valid provided $y - A \\neq 0$.\n\nNow, we isolate the term involving the power of $x$ by subtracting $1$ from both sides:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{D} = \\frac{B - A}{y - A} - 1\n$$\nTo simplify the right-hand side, we find a common denominator, which is $(y - A)$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{D} = \\frac{B - A}{y - A} - \\frac{y - A}{y - A} = \\frac{(B - A) - (y - A)}{y - A}\n$$\nSimplifying the numerator gives:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{D} = \\frac{B - A - y + A}{y - A} = \\frac{B - y}{y - A}\n$$\nTo isolate the base $\\frac{x}{C}$, we raise both sides of the equation to the power of $\\frac{1}{D}$.

For the concentration $x$ to be a real, non-negative physical quantity, certain conditions must hold. Since $x$ is a concentration, $x \\ge 0$. Given that $C  0$, the term $\\left(\\frac{B - y}{y - A}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{D}}$ must be real and non-negative. For an arbitrary real exponent $D$, this requires the base of the power to be non-negative:\n$$\n\\frac{B - y}{y - A} \\ge 0\n$$\nSince $A  B$ is given, this inequality holds if and only if the numerator and denominator are both positive (or the numerator is zero and the denominator is positive), as they cannot both be negative.\n$1$. $B - y \\ge 0 \\implies y \\le B$.\n$2$. $y - A  0 \\implies y  A$.\nCombining these, we get $A  y \\le B$.\nHowever, the range of the original function $y(x)$ for $x \\in (0, \\infty)$ is the open interval $(A, B)$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $y \\to B$ (for $D0$) or $y \\to A$ (for $D0$). As $x \\to 0^+$, $y \\to A$ (for $D0$) or $y \\to B$ (for $D0$). The asymptotes are approached but never reached for finite, positive $x$. Therefore, a measured signal $y$ for which a finite, positive concentration $x$ can be calculated must lie strictly within the open interval $(A, B)$. The strict monotonicity of $y(x)$, guaranteed by $D \\neq 0$, ensures that for each $y$ in this interval, the corresponding $x$ is unique.\n\nRegarding the need for numerical root-finding in more complex models, a closed-form inverse as derived here is only possible when the variable to be solved for, $x$, can be isolated using a finite sequence of algebraic operations. If the calibration model is modified, this often becomes impossible.\nFor example, with an additive cross-reactivity term like $y(x)_{\\text{mod}} = \\left(A + \\frac{B - A}{1 + (x/C)^D}\\right) + kx$, the resulting equation $y_{obs} = \\left(A + \\frac{B - A}{1 + (x/C)^D}\\right) + kx$ is a transcendental equation. There is no general algebraic method to isolate $x$. One must define a function $f(x) = y(x)_{\\text{mod}} - y_{obs}$ and use numerical algorithms (e.g., Newton-Raphson method, bisection method) to find the root $x$ for which $f(x) = 0$.\nSimilarly, if the model accounts for a high-dose hook effect, the function $y(x)$ becomes non-monotonic. A single value of $y$ could correspond to two different concentrations $x$. A simple inverse function does not exist over the entire domain. Numerical methods would be needed to find the potential solutions, and additional information (such as sample dilution) would be required to select the correct one from the multiple roots.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{C \\left(\\frac{B - y}{y - A}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{D}}}\n$$", "id": "5159242"}]}
