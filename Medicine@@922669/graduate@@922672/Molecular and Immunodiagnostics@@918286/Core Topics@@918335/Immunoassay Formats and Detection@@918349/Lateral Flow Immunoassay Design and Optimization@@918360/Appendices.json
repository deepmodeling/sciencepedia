The provided parameters and conditions are self-contained, consistent, and physically realistic. The problem is well-posed and objective, allowing for a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe superficial velocity, $u$, of a fluid driven through a porous medium by a pressure gradient is described by Darcy's Law. In one dimension, this is expressed as:\n$$ u = -\\frac{K}{\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dx} $$\nwhere $K$ is the permeability of the porous medium, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and $\\frac{dP}{dx}$ is the pressure gradient. For capillarity-driven flow in a horizontal strip, the driving force is the capillary pressure, $P_c$, generated by the meniscus in the pores. The pressure gradient is therefore proportional to this capillary pressure. The velocity can thus be expressed as being proportional to the factors that constitute the driving force and a term for viscous resistance:\n$$ u \\propto \\frac{K}{\\mu} P_c $$\nThe problem states that the buffer viscosity, $\\mu$, is constant. Thus, the velocity's dependence on the membrane's physical properties is given by:\n$$ u \\propto K P_c $$\nWe must now relate both permeability $K$ and capillary pressure $P_c$ to the nominal pore radius, $r$.\n\nThe permeability, $K$, of a porous medium can be described by the Kozeny-Carman model (or a simplified form thereof), which relates it to the porosity, $\\epsilon$, and a characteristic dimension of the pores, such as the radius $r$. A common simplified form of this relationship is:\n$$ K = \\frac{\\epsilon r^2}{k_K} $$\nwhere $k_K$ is the Kozeny constant, which depends on the tortuosity and shape of the pores. The problem specifies that the porosity $\\epsilon$ and the Kozeny constant $k_K$ are identical for both membranes. Therefore, the permeability is directly proportional to the square of the pore radius:\n$$ K \\propto r^2 $$\n\nThe capillary pressure, $P_c$, is described by the Young-Laplace equation. For a cylindrical pore, this is:\n$$ P_c = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r} $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the surface tension of the liquid-air interface and $\\theta$ is the contact angle between the liquid and the solid matrix. The problem states that due to identical surface chemistry, both $\\gamma$ and $\\theta$ are constant. Consequently, the capillary pressure is inversely proportional to the pore radius:\n$$ P_c \\propto \\frac{1}{r} $$\n\nCombining these proportionalities, we can determine the relationship between the superficial velocity $u$ and the pore radius $r$:\n$$ u \\propto K P_c \\propto (r^2) \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) $$\n$$ u \\propto r $$\nThis demonstrates that the superficial velocity is directly proportional to the nominal pore radius, assuming all other relevant physical parameters are held constant.\n\nWe can now use this relationship to find the new superficial velocity, $u_2$, for the membrane with a pore radius of $r_2 = 8\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, based on the known velocity, $u_1 = 3.00\\,\\text{mm s}^{-1}$, for the membrane with a pore radius of $r_1 = 15\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.
