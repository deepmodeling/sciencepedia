Assume that the stochastic fluctuations of the blank signal are well modeled by a normal distribution and that the calibration is locally linear in the vicinity of zero analyte concentration. Using the decision-theoretic convention of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), define the limit of detection (LOD) as the analyte concentration that produces an expected signal equal to the blank mean plus $3$ times the blank standard deviation, and define the limit of quantitation (LOQ) analogously with a factor of $10$.

The problem states that the calibration response is linear. The general form of a linear calibration curve is:\n$$S(C) = mC + S_{int}$$\nwhere $m$ is the slope (sensitivity) and $S_{int}$ is the y-intercept.\n\nThe problem provides the following parameters:\n- The slope, $m = 120 \\, \\text{counts}/(\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{mL})$.\n- The intercept, $S_{int}$, is equal to the blank mean signal, $S_b$. We are given $S_b = 50 \\, \\text{counts}$.\n- The standard deviation of the blank signal is $\\sigma_b = 8 \\, \\text{counts}$.\n\nThus, the specific calibration equation for this platform is:\n$$S(C) = mC + S_b$$\n\n**General Expression for Limit of Detection (LOD)**\nThe LOD is defined as the concentration, which we denote as $C_{LOD}$, that produces an expected signal, $S_{LOD}$, equal to the mean blank signal plus $3$ times the standard deviation of the blank signal.\n$$S_{LOD} = S_b + 3\\sigma_b$$\nTo find the concentration $C_{LOD}$ corresponding to this signal, we set the calibration response equal to $S_{LOD}$:\n$$S(C_{LOD}) = m \\cdot C_{LOD} + S_b = S_{LOD}$$\nSubstituting the definition of $S_{LOD}$:\n$$m \\cdot C_{LOD} + S_b = S_b + 3\\sigma_b$$\nThe term $S_b$ cancels from both sides of the equation:\n$$m \\cdot C_{LOD} = 3\\sigma_b$$\nSolving for $C_{LOD}$ yields the general expression for the limit of detection:\n$$C_{LOD} = \\frac{3\\sigma_b}{m}$$\n\n**General Expression for Limit of Quantitation (LOQ)**\nAnalogously, the LOQ is defined as the concentration, $C_{LOQ}$, that produces an expected signal, $S_{LOQ}$, equal to the mean blank signal plus $10$ times the standard deviation of the blank signal.\n$$S_{LOQ} = S_b + 10\\sigma_b$$\nWe set the calibration response at $C_{LOQ}$ equal to $S_{LOQ}$:\n$$S(C_{LOQ}) = m \\cdot C_{LOQ} + S_b = S_{LOQ}$$\nSubstituting the definition of $S_{LOQ}$:\n$$m \\cdot C_{LOQ} + S_b = S_b + 10\\sigma_b$$\nAgain, the term $S_b$ cancels:\n$$m \\cdot C_{LOQ} = 10\\sigma_b$$\nSolving for $C_{LOQ}$ yields the general expression for the limit of quantitation:\n$$C_{LOQ} = \\frac{10\\sigma_b}{m}$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the derived general expressions:\n- $\\sigma_b = 8 \\, \\text{counts}$\n- $m = 120 \\, \\text{counts}/(\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{mL})$\n\nFor the LOD:\n$$C_{LOD} = \\frac{3 \\times 8}{120} = \\frac{24}{120} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \\, \\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{mL}$$\nFor the LOQ:\n$$C_{LOQ} = \\frac{10 \\times 8}{120} = \\frac{80}{120} = \\frac{8}{12} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.66666... \\, \\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\n- $C_{LOD} = 0.2000 \\, \\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{mL}$\n- $C_{LOQ} \\approx 0.6667 \\, \\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{mL}$\n\n**Interpretation**\nThe limit of detection (LOD) represents the lowest concentration of analyte that can be reliably distinguished from a true absence of analyte (the blank). For this platform, a concentration of $0.2000 \\, \\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{mL}$ is the minimum threshold for detection. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) is the lowest concentration that can be measured with an acceptable level of precision and accuracy. At $0.6667 \\, \\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{mL}$, this platform can begin to provide reliable quantitative results. The difference between the LOD and LOQ highlights a critical region of concentration where an analyte may be qualitatively detected but cannot be confidently quantified.
