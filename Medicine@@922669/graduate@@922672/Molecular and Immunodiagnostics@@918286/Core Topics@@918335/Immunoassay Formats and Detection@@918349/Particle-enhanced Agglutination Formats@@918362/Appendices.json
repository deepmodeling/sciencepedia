In such assays, latex particles coated with anti-CRP antibodies form aggregates in the presence of multivalent CRP, increasing light scatter.

In such assays, the observed agglutination signal is only monotonic and calibratable within a validated dynamic range whose upper measuring limit is specified by the manufacturer for the concentration presented to the optical readout. To protect against antigen excess (the high-dose hook effect) and nonlinearity at high concentrations, the instrument performs an on-board predilution before the agglutination readout.\n\nConsider the following scientifically realistic scenario. A patient's sample is expected to have an analyte concentration of $c_{\\mathrm{s}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{IU}\\,\\text{mL}^{-1}$. The instrument performs an automatic predilution by a fold factor of $D_{\\mathrm{auto}} = 5$.

Then compute the minimal nominal manual fold-dilution factor $D_{\\mathrm{nom}}$ that meets this guarantee for the numerical values given.\n\nExpress your final answer as a fold dilution (unitless) and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the minimum nominal manual dilution factor, $D_{\\mathrm{nom}}$, needed to ensure that the final analyte concentration presented to an instrument's readout does not exceed a specified upper limit, $c_U$, even under worst-case pipetting biases.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental principles. The concentration $c$ of a solute is the amount of substance (moles) $n$ per unit volume $V$, i.e., $c = n/V$. During a dilution, a sample volume $V_s$ containing an initial concentration $c_s$ is mixed with a diluent volume $V_d$. Assuming the diluent contains no analyte, the amount of analyte $n_s = c_s V_s$ is conserved. The final volume is $V_f = V_s + V_d$, and the final concentration is $c_f = n_s / V_f = c_s V_s / (V_s + V_d)$.\n\nThe fold-dilution factor, $D$, is defined as the ratio of the final volume to the initial sample volume:\n$$D = \\frac{V_f}{V_s} = \\frac{V_s + V_d}{V_s} = 1 + \\frac{V_d}{V_s}$$\nFrom this, the relationship between initial and final concentration is $c_f = c_s / D$.\n\nThe problem involves a two-step dilution process: a manual dilution followed by an automatic on-board dilution. We must account for systematic biases in the manual pipetting steps. Let $V_{s, \\text{nom}}$ and $V_{d, \\text{nom}}$ be the nominal volumes of the sample and diluent, respectively, for the manual dilution. The nominal manual dilution factor is defined as:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{nom}} = \\frac{V_{s, \\text{nom}} + V_{d, \\text{nom}}}{V_{s, \\text{nom}}}$$\nThis implies the ratio of nominal volumes is $\\frac{V_{d, \\text{nom}}}{V_{s, \\text{nom}}} = D_{\\mathrm{nom}} - 1$.\n\nThe actual pipetted volumes, $V_{s, \\text{act}}$ and $V_{d, \\text{act}}$, can deviate from their nominal values due to biases, $\\epsilon_s$ and $\\epsilon_d$:\n$$V_{s, \\text{act}} = V_{s, \\text{nom}} (1 + \\epsilon_s)$$\n$$V_{d, \\text{act}} = V_{d, \\text{nom}} (1 + \\epsilon_d)$$\nThe actual manual dilution factor, $D_{\\text{act}}$, is therefore:\n$$D_{\\text{act}} = \\frac{V_{s, \\text{act}} + V_{d, \\text{act}}}{V_{s, \\text{act}}} = 1 + \\frac{V_{d, \\text{act}}}{V_{s, \\text{act}}}$$\nThe concentration after the manual dilution is $c_{\\text{manual}} = c_s / D_{\\text{act}}$, where $c_s$ is the original sample concentration.\n\nTo guarantee that the final concentration does not exceed the upper limit $c_U$, we must consider the worst-case scenario. The final concentration will be maximal when the manual dilution is least effective, i.e., when the actual dilution factor $D_{\\text{act}}$ is at its minimum. This occurs when the numerator of the ratio $V_{d, \\text{act}} / V_{s, \\text{act}}$ is minimized and its denominator is maximized. This corresponds to pipetting the minimum possible diluent volume and the maximum possible sample volume. The worst-case biases are given as $\\epsilon_{s, \\text{max}} = +0.01$ and $\\epsilon_{d, \\text{max}} = -0.01$.\n\nThe minimal actual dilution factor, $D_{\\text{act, min}}$, is:\n$$D_{\\text{act, min}} = 1 + \\frac{V_{d, \\text{nom}}(1 + \\epsilon_{d, \\text{max}})}{V_{s, \\text{nom}}(1 + \\epsilon_{s, \\text{max}})}$$\nSubstituting $\\frac{V_{d, \\text{nom}}}{V_{s, \\text{nom}}} = D_{\\mathrm{nom}} - 1$, we express $D_{\\text{act, min}}$ in terms of $D_{\\mathrm{nom}}$:\n$$D_{\\text{act, min}} = 1 + (D_{\\mathrm{nom}} - 1) \\frac{1 + \\epsilon_{d, \\text{max}}}{1 + \\epsilon_{s, \\text{max}}}$$\nThe worst-case (highest) concentration after the manual dilution is $c_{\\text{manual, max}} = c_s / D_{\\text{act, min}}$.\n\nThis manually diluted sample is then subjected to the instrument's automatic dilution by a factor of $D_{\\mathrm{auto}}$. The final concentration presented to the readout in the worst case, $c_{\\text{final, max}}$, is:\n$$c_{\\text{final, max}} = \\frac{c_{\\text{manual, max}}}{D_{\\mathrm{auto}}} = \\frac{c_s}{D_{\\text{act, min}} D_{\\mathrm{auto}}}$$\nThe problem demands that this concentration does not exceed the upper measuring limit, $c_U$:\n$$c_{\\text{final, max}} \\leq c_U \\implies \\frac{c_s}{D_{\\text{act, min}} D_{\\mathrm{auto}}} \\leq c_U$$\nThis can be rearranged to find the minimum required value for $D_{\\text{act, min}}$:\n$$D_{\\text{act, min}} \\geq \\frac{c_s}{c_U D_{\\mathrm{auto}}}$$\nSubstituting our expression for $D_{\\text{act, min}}$ gives the inequality that $D_{\\mathrm{nom}}$ must satisfy:\n$$1 + (D_{\\mathrm{nom}} - 1) \\frac{1 + \\epsilon_{d, \\text{max}}}{1 + \\epsilon_{s, \\text{max}}} \\geq \\frac{c_s}{c_U D_{\\mathrm{auto}}}$$\nTo find the minimal $D_{\\mathrm{nom}}$, we solve for $D_{\\mathrm{nom}}$:\n$$(D_{\\mathrm{nom}} - 1) \\frac{1 + \\epsilon_{d, \\text{max}}}{1 + \\epsilon_{s, \\text{max}}} \\geq \\frac{c_s}{c_U D_{\\mathrm{auto}}} - 1$$\nSince $1 + \\epsilon_{d, \\text{max}} = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99 > 0$, we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of the fraction without changing the inequality direction:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{nom}} - 1 \\geq \\left( \\frac{c_s}{c_U D_{\\mathrm{auto}}} - 1 \\right) \\frac{1 + \\epsilon_{s, \\text{max}}}{1 + \\epsilon_{d, \\text{max}}}$$\n$$D_{\\mathrm{nom}} \\geq 1 + \\left( \\frac{c_s}{c_U D_{\\mathrm{auto}}} - 1 \\right) \\frac{1 + \\epsilon_{s, \\text{max}}}{1 + \\epsilon_{d, \\text{max}}}$$\nThis is the required inequality.
