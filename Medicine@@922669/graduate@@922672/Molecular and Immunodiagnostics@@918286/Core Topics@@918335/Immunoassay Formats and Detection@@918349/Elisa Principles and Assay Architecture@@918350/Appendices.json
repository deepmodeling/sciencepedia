Formulation of the Objective Function**\nThe net objective is the difference between target-mediated signal and off-target background signal. Let the objective function for the pair $(A_i, A_j)$ be denoted $Z(i,j)$.\nThe signal for an antigen $X \\in \\{T, O\\}$ is proportional to the concentration of the sandwich complex $A_i-X-A_j$. The formation of this complex requires the antigen to be present at concentration $[X]$, and for both antibodies $A_i$ and $A_j$ to be bound. The probability of $A_k$ binding to $X$ is given by the fractional occupancy $\\theta_k^X$. The joint probability of forming a sandwich is modulated by the non-overlap factor $s_{ij}$. The signal is further scaled by the detection antibody's label efficiency $\\eta_j$.\nThus, the signal contribution from antigen $X$ can be modeled as:\n$$ S_X(i,j) = k \\cdot [X] \\cdot \\theta_i^X \\cdot \\theta_j^X \\cdot s_{ij} \\cdot \\eta_j $$\nwhere $k$ is an instrument-specific proportionality constant.\n\nThe net objective function is $Z(i,j) = S_T(i,j) - S_O(i,j)$.\n$$ Z(i,j) = k \\cdot \\eta_j \\cdot s_{ij} \\cdot ([T] \\theta_i^T \\theta_j^T - [O] \\theta_i^O \\theta_j^O) $$\nSince we are maximizing this function, the constant $k$ can be disregarded. We define the objective function to maximize as $Z'(i,j)$:\n$$ Z'(i,j) = \\eta_j \\cdot s_{ij} \\cdot ([T] \\theta_i^T \\theta_j^T - [O] \\theta_i^O \\theta_j^O) $$\n\n**2. Calculation of Non-Overlap Factors, $s_{ij}$**\nUsing the definition $s_{ij} = 1 - \\max(c_{ij}, c_{ji})$ for $i \\neq j$ and $s_{ii}=0$:\n-   $s_{12} = s_{21} = 1 - \\max(c_{12}, c_{21}) = 1 - \\max(0.60, 0.40) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$\n-   $s_{13} = s_{31} = 1 - \\max(c_{13}, c_{31}) = 1 - \\max(0.10, 0.05) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$\n-   $s_{23} = s_{32} = 1 - \\max(c_{23}, c_{32}) = 1 - \\max(0.70, 0.65) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30$\n\nThe epitope compatibility matrix $S = [s_{ij}]$ is:\n$$ S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0.40 & 0.90 \\\\ 0.40 & 0 & 0.30 \\\\ 0.90 & 0.30 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**3.
