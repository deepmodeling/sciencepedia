Condition Number $\\kappa_{2}(M)$ and Justification of the $2$-Norm\n\nThe $2$-norm condition number of an invertible matrix $M$ is defined as $\\kappa_{2}(M) = \\|M\\|_2 \\|M^{-1}\\|_2$. The matrix $2$-norm $\\|M\\|_2$ is its largest singular value, $\\sigma_{\\max}(M)$. The condition number can be expressed as the ratio of the largest to the smallest singular value:\n$$ \\kappa_{2}(M) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max}(M)}{\\sigma_{\\min}(M)} $$\nThe singular values of $M$, denoted $\\sigma_i(M)$, are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix $M^T M$. Since $M = Q D$ and $Q$ is an orthogonal matrix ($Q^T Q = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix), we find:\n$$ M^T M = (Q D)^T (Q D) = D^T Q^T Q D = D^T I D = D^T D $$\nAs $D$ is a diagonal matrix, $D^T = D$, which gives $M^T M = D^2$.\n$$ D^2 = \\operatorname{diag}\\left(1.20^2, 0.90^2, 1.10^2, 0.80^2\\right) = \\operatorname{diag}(1.44, 0.81, 1.21, 0.64) $$\nThe eigenvalues of this diagonal matrix are its diagonal entries: $\\{1.44, 0.81, 1.21, 0.64\\}$. The singular values of $M$ are the square roots of these eigenvalues:\n$$ \\{\\sqrt{1.44}, \\sqrt{0.81}, \\sqrt{1.21}, \\sqrt{0.64}\\} = \\{1.20, 0.90, 1.10, 0.80\\} $$\nThe largest and smallest singular values are therefore:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\max}(M) = \\max\\{1.20, 0.90, 1.10, 0.80\\} = 1.20 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\min}(M) = \\min\\{1.20, 0.90, 1.10, 0.80\\} = 0.80 $$\nThe condition number is the ratio of these values:\n$$ \\kappa_{2}(M) = \\frac{1.20}{0.80} = \\frac{12}{8} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 $$\n\nThe use of the $2$-norm, and by extension the singular value decomposition, is physically motivated. The squared Euclidean norm of the intensity vector, $\\|\\mathbf{I}\\|_2^2 = \\sum_i I_i^2$, is proportional to the total signal energy. An orthogonal transformation, such as the spectral mixing modeled by $Q$, is an isometry with respect to the $2$-norm; it preserves the length of vectors and thus the signal energy: $\\|Q\\mathbf{x}\\|_2^2 = \\mathbf{x}^T Q^T Q \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{x}^T \\mathbf{x} = \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_2^2$. Because the mixing part of the measurement process is energy-preserving, the $2$-norm is the natural metric for quantifying signal magnitude. The matrix $2$-norm $\\|M\\|_2$ measures the maximal amplification of the signal's Euclidean magnitude (square root of energy). Consequently, $\\kappa_{2}(M)$ provides a direct, physically meaningful measure of the system's numerical stability, indicating how much the relative error in the input data (raw intensities) can be amplified in the output (corrected intensities), specifically in terms of signal energy. In this case, the SVD demonstrates that the system instability is due entirely to the differing gains in the diagonal matrix $D$, not the mixing process $Q$.\n\n3.

Both are far greater than $3$, so this condition is met. This indicates that both an adenine and a guanine signal are present with very high confidence.\n3.  **Intensity Ratio Test ($\\le 1.5$)**: The demixed intensities are $\\hat{x}_A \\approx 880.86$ (top) and $\\hat{x}_G \\approx 794.30$ (second). The ratio is $\\frac{880.86}{794.30} \\approx 1.11$. This value is less than or equal to $1.5$. This condition is also met.\nThe combination of these criteria (both signals significant and their intensities are not drastically different) is a standard and robust heuristic for calling a heterozygous base (IUPAC code \"R\" for A or G). The procedure and conclusion are fully supported by the data.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Declare a single-base adenine call using maximum likelihood demixing, requiring only that the demixed adenine intensity exceed $3 \\sigma$; ignore the demixed guanine component if adenine passes threshold.**\nThis option correctly advocates for demixing. However, its decision logic is flawed. The rule to \"ignore the demixed guanine component\" is scientifically unsound. The purpose of demixing is to obtain the best estimates for *all* components. Our analysis showed that the demixed guanine signal $\\hat{x}_G$ is extremely strong ($z_G \\approx 11.06$). To willfully ignore this strong evidence for guanine is incorrect and would lead to a misinterpretation of the data. The data strongly support the presence of both bases.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Declare a single-base guanine call using the raw observed intensities only (no cross-talk correction), because $y_{\\text{guanine}}$ is large and the adenine and guanine peaks overlap.**\nThis option is incorrect for two primary reasons. First, it advocates using raw intensities and ignoring the known cross-talk. This is a flawed methodology, as it fails to correct for a known systematic error. The principle of linear superposition provided in the problem statement explicitly justifies cross-talk correction. Second, even with this flawed methodology, the conclusion is wrong. The raw intensity for adenine is $y_A = 1000$ and for guanine is $y_G = 900$. Based on raw peak height, adenine has the stronger signal, not guanine. The option incorrectly suggests a guanine call.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Declare “no call” because the overlapping peaks indicate poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and neither demixed component can be significantly distinguished from baseline at $4 \\sigma$.**\nThis option presents two factually incorrect claims. First, \"overlapping peaks indicate poor signal-to-noise ratio\" is a false premise. Overlapping peaks are caused by spectral overlap or heterozygosity and are independent of SNR. In this case, the raw signals ($1000$ and $900$) are very large compared to the noise standard deviation ($\\sigma=70$), indicating excellent SNR ($y_A/\\sigma_A \\approx 14.3$). Second, the claim that \"neither demixed component can be significantly distinguished from baseline at $4 \\sigma$\" is false. Our calculated $z$-scores ($z_A \\approx 12.22$ and $z_G \\approx 11.06$) are both substantially larger than $4$. Therefore, both components are highly significant.

Which option correctly captures both the indexing relation that encodes the one-base phase shift between the alleles and the expected fraction of indices $x$ that will display double peaks in the electropherogram far downstream of the insertion?\n\nA. Beyond the insertion, the heterozygous trace at index $x$ is the superposition of bases $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x$ and $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1}$ (via $S^{(\\mathrm{B})}_x$), so double peaks occur whenever $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x \\neq S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1}$; under $p_{\\mathrm{A}} = p_{\\mathrm{C}} = p_{\\mathrm{G}} = p_{\\mathrm{T}} = 1/4$, the expected fraction of double peaks is $3/4$.\n\nB. Beyond the insertion, the heterozygous trace at index $x$ is the superposition of bases $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x$ and $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x+1}$ (via $S^{(\\mathrm{B})}_x$), and under $p_{\\mathrm{A}} = p_{\\mathrm{C}} = p_{\\mathrm{G}} = p_{\\mathrm{T}} = 1/4$, the expected fraction of double peaks is $3/4$.\n\nC. The insertion produces an exact alternation of single and double peaks strictly at every other index $x$ beyond the indel, yielding an expected double-peak fraction of $1/2$, because capillary mobility differences cause alternate peaks to merge.\n\nD. The base-calling algorithm eliminates phase differences beyond the indel so that peaks are single except at the indel itself; the expected double-peak fraction downstream is $0$.", "solution": "## PROBLEM VALIDATION\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The analysis concerns a heterozygous single-nucleotide insertion in an exon.\n- Sanger sequencing with fluorescently labeled dideoxynucleotide triphosphates (ddNTPs) is used.\n- Fragment separation is by capillary electrophoresis.\n- The electropherogram axis is indexed by $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the number of incorporated nucleotides from a forward primer.\n- Allele $\\mathrm{A}$ is the reference sequence: $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_1, S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_2, \\dots$.\n- Allele $\\mathrm{B}$ has one extra nucleotide $b$ inserted between positions $i_0-1$ and $i_0$ of allele $\\mathrm{A}$.\n- $i_0 \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is the index of the first base of allele $\\mathrm{A}$ downstream of the insertion.\n- The electropherogram peak at index $x$ is the combined signal from the terminating base of allele $\\mathrm{A}$ at position $x$ and allele $\\mathrm{B}$ at position $x$.\n- Downstream of the insertion, nucleotide identities along allele $\\mathrm{A}$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with marginal probabilities $p_{\\mathrm{A}} = p_{\\mathrm{C}} = p_{\\mathrm{G}} = p_{\\mathrm{T}} = 1/4$.\n- The question asks for the indexing relation encoding the phase shift and the expected fraction of double peaks far downstream of the insertion.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, describing the standard model of Sanger sequencing for a heterozygous indel. The language is objective and precise. The setup is well-posed, providing all necessary information to establish the relationship between the two allele sequences and to perform the requested probability calculation.\n\n-   **Scientific and Factual Soundness**: The description of Sanger sequencing, fragment analysis, and heterozygous electropherogram traces is accurate. The scenario of a single-base insertion is a common and analyzable mutation.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem defines the sequences, the insertion point, the composition of the signal at any given index $x$, and the statistical properties of the sequence downstream. This is sufficient to derive a unique answer.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in formal, technical terms without subjective bias.\n\nNo flaws are identified. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe problem asks for two things: the relationship between the bases from the two alleles that contribute to the signal at a given electropherogram index $x$ downstream of the insertion, and the resulting expected fraction of double peaks.\n\n### 1. Indexing and Phase Shift Analysis\nLet the sequence of allele $\\mathrm{A}$ be $S^{(\\mathrm{A})} = (S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_1, S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_2, \\dots, S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{i_0-1}, S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{i_0}, S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{i_0+1}, \\dots)$.\nAllele $\\mathrm{B}$ has an extra nucleotide $b$ inserted between positions $i_0-1$ and $i_0$ of allele $\\mathrm{A}$. This means the sequence of allele $\\mathrm{B}$, denoted $S^{(\\mathrm{B})}$, is constructed as follows:\n-   The first $i_0-1$ bases are identical to allele $\\mathrm{A}$: $S^{(\\mathrm{B})}_j = S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_j$ for $j < i_0$.\n-   The base at the new position $i_0$ is the inserted base: $S^{(\\mathrm{B})}_{i_0} = b$.\n-   The subsequent bases in allele $\\mathrm{B}$ are the shifted bases from allele $\\mathrm{A}$. The base at position $i_0+1$ in allele $\\mathrm{B}$ is $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{i_0}$, the base at $i_0+2$ in $\\mathrm{B}$ is $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{i_0+1}$, and so on. In general, for any index $j > i_0$, the base is $S^{(\\mathrm{B})}_j = S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{j-1}$.\n\nThe electropherogram is indexed by $x$, the fragment length. The problem states that the signal at index $x$ is the superposition of the terminating bases from both alleles for fragments of length $x$.\n-   A fragment of length $x$ from allele $\\mathrm{A}$ is terminated by base $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x$.\n-   A fragment of length $x$ from allele $\\mathrm{B}$ is terminated by base $S^{(\\mathrm{B})}_x$.\n\nWe are interested in the region \"far downstream of the insertion\", which corresponds to indices $x \\gg i_0$. For any such $x$, we have $x > i_0$.\nIn this region, the set of bases contributing to the signal at electropherogram index $x$ is $\\{S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x, S^{(\\mathrm{B})}_x\\}$.\nUsing our derived relationship for $x > i_0$, we can substitute for $S^{(\\mathrm{B})}_x$:\nSet of bases at index $x$: $\\{S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x, S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1}\\}$.\n\nThis establishes the indexing relation: the signal at index $x$ is a superposition of the signals from base $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x$ and base $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1}$. This represents a one-base phase shift between the two sequences as they are read out on the electropherogram.\n\n### 2. Expected Fraction of Double Peaks\nA \"double peak\" occurs at index $x$ if the two contributing bases are different. Based on the relationship derived above, for $x > i_0$, a double peak occurs if and only if $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x \\neq S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1}$.\n\nWe are given that, downstream of the insertion, the nucleotides in allele $\\mathrm{A}$ are independent and identically distributed with probabilities $p_{\\mathrm{A}} = p_{\\mathrm{C}} = p_{\\mathrm{G}} = p_{\\mathrm{T}} = 1/4$.\nThe expected fraction of double peaks is equal to the probability that $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x \\neq S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1}$ for any given $x > i_0$.\nIt is simpler to first calculate the complementary probability: the probability that the bases are the same, $P(S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x = S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1})$.\n\n$P(S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x = S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1}) = \\sum_{N \\in \\{\\mathrm{A, C, G, T}\\}} P(S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x = N \\text{ and } S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1} = N)$\n\nBecause the bases are independent, the joint probability is the product of the marginal probabilities:\n$P(S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x = S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1}) = \\sum_{N \\in \\{\\mathrm{A, C, G, T}\\}} P(S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x = N) \\times P(S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1} = N)$\n\nSubstituting the given probabilities:\n$P(S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x = S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1}) = (1/4 \\times 1/4)_{\\mathrm{A}} + (1/4 \\times 1/4)_{\\mathrm{C}} + (1/4 \\times 1/4)_{\\mathrm{G}} + (1/4 \\times 1/4)_{\\mathrm{T}}$\n$P(S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x = S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1}) = 4 \\times (1/16) = 4/16 = 1/4$.\n\nThe probability of a double peak is therefore:\n$P(S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x \\neq S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1}) = 1 - P(S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x = S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1}) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4$.\n\nBy the law of large numbers, this probability is equal to the expected fraction of indices far downstream that will display double peaks.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. Beyond the insertion, the heterozygous trace at index $x$ is the superposition of bases $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x$ and $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1}$ (via $S^{(\\mathrm{B})}_x$), so double peaks occur whenever $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x \\neq S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1}$; under $p_{\\mathrm{A}} = p_{\\mathrm{C}} = p_{\\mathrm{G}} = p_{\\mathrm{T}} = 1/4$, the expected fraction of double peaks is $3/4$.**\n- The indexing relation stating the superposition is of $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x$ and $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1}$ is correct, as derived above.\n- The condition for a double peak, $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x \\neq S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x-1}$, is correct.\n- The calculated expected fraction of $3/4$ is correct.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Beyond the insertion, the heterozygous trace at index $x$ is the superposition of bases $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_x$ and $S^{(\\mathrm{A})}_{x+1}$ (via $S^{(\\mathrm{B})}_x$), and under $p_{\\mathrm{A}} = p_{\\mathrm{C}} = p_{\\mathrm{G}} = p_{\\mathrm{T}} = 1/4$, the expected fraction of double peaks is $3/4$.**\n- The indexing relation is incorrect. An insertion in allele $\\mathrm{B}$ causes its sequence to lag behind allele $\\mathrm{A}$ relative to the original sequence positions. Therefore, for a fragment of length $x$, the base from allele $\\mathrm{B}$ corresponds to the base at position $x-1$ in allele $\\mathrm{A}$, not $x+1$. This would correspond to a deletion, not an insertion.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The insertion produces an exact alternation of single and double peaks strictly at every other index $x$ beyond the indel, yielding an expected double-peak fraction of $1/2$, because capillary mobility differences cause alternate peaks to merge.**\n- The claim of an \"exact alternation\" implies a deterministic sequence pattern, which contradicts the i.i.d. random sequence model given in the problem.\n- The resulting fraction of $1/2$ is incorrect; the calculated value is $3/4$.\n- The invocation of \"capillary mobility differences\" is a distractor; the problem as stated is about sequence superposition, not electrophoretic artifacts like compression, which while real, are not the fundamental cause of the phase shift.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The base-calling algorithm eliminates phase differences beyond the indel so that peaks are single except at the indel itself; the expected double-peak fraction downstream is $0$.**\n- This option confuses the raw electropherogram data with the processed output of a sophisticated base-calling algorithm. The question asks about the \"expected prevalence of double peaks\" in the electropherogram trace itself, which is the physical signal showing the superposition. The raw trace will undeniably show double peaks.\n- The claim that the expected fraction of double peaks is $0$ is incorrect. It is $3/4$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5111637"}]}
