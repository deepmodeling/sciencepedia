In sandwich assays that use biotin-streptavidin coupling, excess biotin in the sample causes negative bias (for example, competitive inhibition of the binding of biotinylated detection reagents to streptavidin), which may be relieved by dilution, but that mechanism does not produce the computed bell-shaped $S(\\alpha)$ for $\\mathsf{S1}$ tied to $[A]/(K + [A])^2$, nor does adding excess biotin mitigate biotin interference (it typically exacerbates it). Mitigation for biotin interference involves avoiding biotin-streptavidin architectures or waiting for biotin washout, not adding biotin. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. This option claims no interference and blames calibration drift for nonparallel dilution series. The computed $S(\\alpha)$ for $\\mathsf{S1}$ is nonmonotonic with a peak at $[A] \\approx K$, characteristic of the hook effect, and the monotonic inverse dependence for $\\mathsf{S2}$ is characteristic of heterophile dilution behavior. These are not explained by calibration drift. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.\n\nMitigation rationale, tied to first principles: For the hook effect, the derived $[CAD] = \\dfrac{[C]_T [D]_T [A]}{(K + [A])^2}$ shows the adverse role of high $[A]$ in sequestering $C$ and $D$ into monovalent complexes, reducing the available $[D]$ and $[C]$ for forming $[CAD]$. Two-step formats that allow $A$ to bind $C$ and wash away excess $A$ before adding $D$ increase the effective $[D]$ available to $CA$, thereby increasing $[CAD]$. Predilution moves the sample closer to $[A] \\approx K$, maximizing $[CAD]$. For heterophile interference, $[CHD] \\propto [H]$ under the weak-bridging approximation, so dilution reduces $[CHD]$ and blocking reagents that occupy the heterophile binding sites or remove Fc interactions lower $K_b$ and thus $[CHD]$ directly, restoring assay specificity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5118846"}]}
