Analysis of Normal Conditions ($1\\times$ Buffer)**\n\nUnder normal conditions, the gel resistance $R_g$ and the buffer resistance $R_{b, 1\\times}$ are in series.\nThe total resistance of the circuit is:\n$$R_{total, 1\\times} = R_g + R_{b, 1\\times} = 2000\\,\\Omega + 1000\\,\\Omega = 3000\\,\\Omega$$\nThe power supply is at a constant voltage $V = 200\\,\\mathrm{V}$. Using Ohm's Law ($V=IR$), the total current is:\n$$I_{total, 1\\times} = \\frac{V}{R_{total, 1\\times}} = \\frac{200\\,\\mathrm{V}}{3000\\,\\Omega} = \\frac{2}{30}\\,\\mathrm{A} \\approx 0.0667\\,\\mathrm{A} = 66.7\\,\\mathrm{mA}$$\n\n**2. Analysis of Error Conditions ($10\\times$ Buffer)**\n\nIn the error condition, the tank buffer is $10\\times$ more concentrated. The problem states that the buffer resistance $R_b$ scales inversely with the concentration. Therefore, the new buffer resistance $R_{b, 10\\times}$ is:\n$$R_{b, 10\\times} = \\frac{R_{b, 1\\times}}{10} = \\frac{1000\\,\\Omega}{10} = 100\\,\\Omega$$\nThe gel resistance $R_g$ is initially unchanged, so $R_g = 2000\\,\\Omega$. The new total resistance is:\n$$R_{total, 10\\times} = R_g + R_{b, 10\\times} = 2000\\,\\Omega + 100\\,\\Omega = 2100\\,\\Omega$$\nThe new total current is:\n$$I_{total, 10\\times} = \\frac{V}{R_{total, 10\\times}} = \\frac{200\\,\\mathrm{V}}{2100\\,\\Omega} = \\frac{2}{21}\\,\\mathrm{A} \\approx 0.0952\\,\\mathrm{A} = 95.2\\,\\mathrm{mA}$$\nThe ratio of the new current to the old current is:\n$$\\frac{I_{total, 10\\times}}{I_{total, 1\\times}} = \\frac{95.2\\,\\mathrm{mA}}{66.7\\,\\mathrm{mA}} \\approx 1.43$$\nSo, the total current increases by a factor of approximately $1.4\\times$.\n\n**3. Analysis of Power Dissipation and Heat Generation**\n\nWe must analyze the power dissipated as heat ($P=I^2R$) specifically *within the gel*, as this is where the separation occurs and where overheating causes the most damage.\n\nPower dissipation in the gel under normal conditions:\n$$P_{g, 1\\times} = (I_{total, 1\\times})^2 R_g = \\left(\\frac{2}{30}\\,\\mathrm{A}\\right)^2 \\times 2000\\,\\Omega = \\frac{4}{900} \\times 2000\\,\\mathrm{W} = \\frac{80}{9}\\,\\mathrm{W} \\approx 8.9\\,\\mathrm{W}$$\nPower dissipation in the gel under error conditions:\n$$P_{g, 10\\times} = (I_{total, 10\\times})^2 R_g = \\left(\\frac{2}{21}\\,\\mathrm{A}\\right)^2 \\times 2000\\,\\Omega = \\frac{4}{441} \\times 2000\\,\\mathrm{W} = \\frac{8000}{441}\\,\\mathrm{W} \\approx 18.1\\,\\mathrm{W}$$\nThe ratio of power dissipation in the gel is:\n$$\\frac{P_{g, 10\\times}}{P_{g, 1\\times}} = \\frac{18.1\\,\\mathrm{W}}{8.9\\,\\mathrm{W}} \\approx 2.03$$\nThe power dissipated in the gel, and thus the rate of Joule heating within the gel, approximately doubles.\n\n**4. Analysis of Biochemical Consequences**\n\n- **Temperature Rise and pH Change**: A doubling of power dissipation in the gel, coupled with passive cooling, will cause a substantial increase in the gel's temperature. The buffer in the gel is a Tris-based buffer. The $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ of Tris is known to be temperature-dependent, decreasing by approximately $0.028$ units per degree Celsius increase ($\\Delta \\mathrm{p}K_a / \\Delta T \\approx -0.028\\,\\mathrm{^\\circ C^{-1}}$). A significant temperature rise of $30-40\\,\\mathrm{^\\circ C}$ is plausible, which would lead to a pH drop in the gel buffer of $30 \\times 0.028 \\approx 0.84$ or more. A drop of $0.8$–$1.0$ units is a reasonable estimate.\n\n- **Disruption of the Discontinuous Buffer System**: The Tris-Glycine system relies on a moving boundary between a highly mobile leading ion (Chloride, $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$) and a less mobile trailing ion (glycinate). The mobility of glycine is a strong function of pH. Glycine is a zwitterion with a net charge near zero at neutral pH, but it becomes negatively charged (glycinate) at the alkaline pH of the resolving gel (typically $\\mathrm{pH}\\ 8.8$). This ionization is what allows it to function as the trailing ion. If the gel overheats and the pH drops significantly (e.g., towards $8.0$ or below), the equilibrium for glycine deprotonation shifts, and a larger fraction of it reverts to the zwitterionic form. This dramatically reduces its net negative charge and electrophoretic mobility.\n\n- **Effect on Gel Run**: The trailing ion can no longer keep pace with the leading ion, disrupting the \"stacking\" effect and the formation of the sharp moving boundary. This leads to poor resolution, diffuse bands, and incorrect relative migration of proteins.\n\n- **Physical Effects of Overheating**: The temperature is not uniform across the gel; the center is typically hotter than the edges. This temperature gradient creates a corresponding pH and mobility gradient, causing proteins in the center to migrate faster than at the edges. This results in curved, U-shaped bands, a phenomenon known as \"smiling\". In extreme cases, the polyacrylamide gel matrix itself can soften, deform, or even melt, causing gross distortion of the lanes.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The total current increases from approximately $66\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ to approximately $95\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ (about $1.4\\times$); the power dissipated in the gel approximately doubles, producing substantial Joule heating. The resulting temperature rise lowers the Tris buffer $\\mathrm{pH}$ by roughly $0.8$–$1.0$ units during overheating, shifting glycine toward its zwitterionic form, disrupting the moving boundary and causing distorted, “smiling” bands and possible gel softening or melting.**\n- **Quantitative Electrical Analysis**: The calculated current increase from $66.7\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ to $95.2\\,\\mathrm{mA}$ (a $1.43\\times$ increase) and the doubling of power dissipation in the gel are consistent with the values in this option.\n- **Qualitative Biochemical Analysis**: The predicted consequences—Joule heating, pH drop in Tris buffer, shift in glycine ionization, disruption of the moving boundary, and physical distortions like \"smiling\" and softening—are all correct and follow logically from the electrical changes.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The total current decreases because the higher ionic strength reduces the electric field in the gel; heat generation drops accordingly, improving band sharpness by enhancing stacking, and the gel remains mechanically intact without distortion.**\n- The total resistance of the circuit decreases, so at constant voltage, the current must increase. The primary premise is false. Heat generation in the gel increases, it does not drop. The consequences described are the opposite of what would occur.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The total current increases by roughly $10\\times$ and the total power increases by roughly $10\\times$, but the buffer pH remains essentially constant; proteins simply migrate faster with unchanged band shape, and the gel integrity is unaffected.**\n- The quantitative claim of a $10\\times$ increase in current is a gross overestimation; our calculation shows a $1.43\\times$ increase. The claim that pH remains constant is biochemically false for a Tris buffer under significant heating. The prediction of unchanged band shape is incorrect.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The total current changes by less than $5\\%$, but most of the voltage shifts to the buffer reservoirs, keeping field strength low in the gel; proteins remain trapped in the stacking gel and do not enter the resolving gel, and any overheating is confined to the buffer rather than the gel itself.**\n- The current change is approximately $43\\%$, not less than $5\\%$. The voltage drop across the gel *increases* because its resistance constitutes a larger fraction of the new, smaller total resistance (from $2000/3000 = 67\\%$ to $2000/2100 = 95\\%$). The field strength in the gel increases. Power dissipation in the buffer actually *decreases* from $P_{b, 1\\times} \\approx 4.4\\,\\mathrm{W}$ to $P_{b, 10\\times} = (2/21)^2(100) \\approx 0.9\\,\\mathrm{W}$, while power in the gel doubles. Every claim in this option is factually wrong.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5170778"}]}
