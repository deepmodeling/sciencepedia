This initial practice focuses on a critical quality control step: assessing the purity of an extracted DNA sample. By applying the Beer-Lambert law and understanding the distinct ultraviolet absorbance properties of nucleic acids and proteins, one can use the $A_{260}/A_{280}$ ratio to diagnose common contaminants and predict their potential to impair subsequent enzymatic reactions and physical transfer steps [@problem_id:5163500].", "problem": "A laboratory performing Southern blotting for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) detection evaluates the purity of an extracted genomic DNA sample by ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy using a $1~\\mathrm{cm}$ pathlength cuvette. The measured absorbances are $A_{260} = 0.25$ and $A_{280} = 0.12$. Starting from the Beer–Lambert law, $A = \\varepsilon b c$, and the well-established spectroscopic fact that nucleic acid bases absorb maximally near $260~\\mathrm{nm}$ whereas aromatic amino acid residues in proteins absorb maximally near $280~\\mathrm{nm}$, compute the purity index $A_{260}/A_{280}$ and, based on first principles, reason whether protein contamination is likely to impair restriction endonuclease digestion and capillary transfer during Southern blotting of this sample.\n\nReport the numerical value of $A_{260}/A_{280}$ rounded to four significant figures. The purity index is dimensionless.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed, and therefore is deemed valid. The solution requires a two-part response: a quantitative calculation of a purity index and a qualitative-reasoning based on established biophysical principles.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Purity Index**\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of the purity index, which is defined as the dimensionless ratio of the absorbance of the sample at a wavelength of $260~\\mathrm{nm}$ to the absorbance at $280~\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nThe provided data are:\n- Absorbance at $260~\\mathrm{nm}$: $A_{260} = 0.25$\n- Absorbance at $280~\\mathrm{nm}$: $A_{280} = 0.12$\n\nThe purity index, denoted here as $R$, is calculated as follows:\n$$ R = \\frac{A_{260}}{A_{280}} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values into the expression:\n$$ R = \\frac{0.25}{0.12} \\approx 2.08333... $$\nThe problem explicitly requests that this value be reported rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ R \\approx 2.083 $$\n\n**Part 2: Reasoning on the Impact of Protein Contamination**\n\nThe evaluation of the sample's suitability for downstream enzymatic and physical processes is based on the interpretation of this purity index, rooted in the principles of spectrophotometry as described by the Beer–Lambert law, $A = \\varepsilon b c$. Here, $A$ is absorbance, $\\varepsilon$ is the molar extinction coefficient, $b$ is the pathlength (given as $1~\\mathrm{cm}$), and $c$ is the concentration of the absorbing species.\n\nFor a mixed sample containing both deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and protein (P), the total absorbance at a given wavelength ($\\lambda$) is the sum of the contributions from each component:\n$$ A_{\\lambda} = A_{\\lambda, \\text{DNA}} + A_{\\lambda, \\text{P}} $$\nUsing the Beer–Lambert law, this can be written as:\n$$ A_{\\lambda} = (\\varepsilon_{\\lambda, \\text{DNA}} c_{\\text{DNA}} + \\varepsilon_{\\lambda, \\text{P}} c_{\\text{P}}) b $$\nThe utility of the $A_{260}/A_{280}$ ratio stems from the differing spectral properties of nucleic acids and proteins:\n1.  Nucleic acids exhibit a strong absorbance maximum around $260~\\mathrm{nm}$ due to the electronic structure of their purine and pyrimidine bases.\n2.  Proteins exhibit an absorbance maximum around $280~\\mathrm{nm}$ due to the presence of aromatic amino acid residues (primarily tryptophan and tyrosine).\n\nBased on these properties, the following benchmark ratios are established:\n- For pure double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), the accepted theoretical ratio is $\\frac{A_{260}}{A_{280}} \\approx 1.8$.\n- For pure protein, the ratio is typically in the range of $\\frac{A_{260}}{A_{280}} \\approx 0.57$.\n\nIf a DNA sample is contaminated with protein, the protein's absorbance contribution is greater at $280~\\mathrm{nm}$ than at $260~\\mathrm{nm}$. This disproportionately increases the denominator of the $A_{260}/A_{280}$ ratio, causing the value to decrease below the ideal of $1.8$. Therefore, a ratio significantly less than $1.8$ is a robust indicator of protein contamination.\n\nThe calculated purity index for the sample is $\\approx 2.083$. This value is substantially *higher* than $1.8$. This indicates that there is no significant protein contamination in the sample. A ratio of approximately $2.0$ is characteristic of pure ribonucleic acid (RNA), so the high value may suggest some RNA is present, but it effectively rules out protein as a major contaminant.\n\nGiven this conclusion, we can address the question of whether protein contamination is likely to impair subsequent steps in the Southern blotting protocol:\n\n- **Restriction Endonuclease Digestion:** This is an enzymatic process where restriction enzymes cleave DNA at specific recognition sites. If significant protein contamination were present (which it is not), it could inhibit this process. Potential inhibitory proteins include co-purified nucleases that degrade the DNA sample or other DNA-binding proteins that sterically block the restriction sites, preventing enzyme access. Since the spectrophotometric data indicate high purity from protein, such inhibition is not expected.\n\n- **Capillary Transfer:** This is the physical process of transferring DNA fragments from the electrophoresis gel to a solid support membrane. A high concentration of precipitated protein contaminants could clog the pores of the gel and/or the membrane, leading to inefficient and non-uniform transfer. The high purity index of the sample indicates that this is not a concern.\n\nIn conclusion, the spectrophotometric analysis yields a purity index of $\\approx 2.083$. This value is greater than the benchmark of $1.8$ for pure dsDNA, which signifies that the sample is substantially free from protein contamination. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that protein contamination will impair the critical steps of restriction endonuclease digestion and capillary transfer during the Southern blotting procedure for this sample.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.083}$$", "id": "5163500"}, {"introduction": "Following sample verification, the next crucial phase is the restriction digest, which must be both complete and specific.

The mass of genomic DNA to be digested is given as $m = 10 \\, \\mu\\text{g}$.\n\nThe first step is to calibrate the kinetic model parameters using the information provided in the enzyme unit definition. The fraction of undigested restriction sites, $f(t)$, is modeled by a pseudo-first-order decay process:\n$$\nf(t) = \\exp(-k t)\n$$\nThe effective rate constant $k$ is proportional to the enzyme-to-DNA ratio:\n$$\nk = \\gamma \\frac{U}{m}\n$$\nHere, $U$ is the amount of enzyme in units (U), $m$ is the mass of DNA in $\\mu\\text{g}$, and $\\gamma$ is a proportionality constant.

The rate constant $k$ is therefore:\n$$\nk = \\gamma \\frac{U}{m} = (2 \\ln(10)) \\frac{U}{10} \\, \\text{h}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe next step is to formulate the optimization problem. We need to minimize the star activity risk index $R(U,t)$, defined as:\n$$\nR(U,t) = \\alpha \\, t + \\beta \\, \\frac{U}{m}\n$$\nWith the given parameters $\\alpha=1$, $\\beta=1$, and $m=10 \\, \\mu\\text{g}$:\n$$\nR(U,t) = t + \\frac{U}{10}\n$$\nThis minimization is subject to the constraint that the digestion is at least $0.99$ complete, meaning the fraction of undigested sites $f(t)$ must be less than or equal to $0.01$:\n$$\nf(t) = \\exp(-k t) \\le 0.01\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $k$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left( -\\left( (2 \\ln(10)) \\frac{U}{10} \\right) t \\right) \\le 0.01\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides of the inequality:\n$$\n-\\left( (2 \\ln(10)) \\frac{U}{10} \\right) t \\le \\ln(0.01) = -2 \\ln(10)\n$$\nWe can divide both sides by $-2 \\ln(10)$. Since this is a negative quantity, we must reverse the inequality sign:\n$$\n\\frac{U t}{10} \\ge 1\n$$\n$$\nU t \\ge 10\n$$\nThe problem is now to minimize the function $R(U,t) = t + \\frac{U}{10}$ subject to the constraint $U t \\ge 10$, where $U > 0$ and $t > 0$.\n\nThe objective function $R(U,t)$ is an increasing function of both $U$ and $t$. Therefore, to find its minimum value, we must operate at the boundary of the feasible region defined by the constraint. This means the inequality constraint becomes an equality:\n$$\nU t = 10\n$$\nWe can use this equation to express one variable in terms of the other. Let us express $U$ as a function of $t$:\n$$\nU = \\frac{10}{t}\n$$\nSubstitute this into the objective function $R(U,t)$ to obtain a function of a single variable, $t$:\n$$\nR(t) = t + \\frac{1}{10} \\left(\\frac{10}{t}\\right) = t + \\frac{1}{t}\n$$\nTo find the value of $t$ that minimizes $R(t)$ for $t > 0$, we use differential calculus. We compute the first derivative of $R(t)$ with respect to $t$ and set it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(t + t^{-1}\\right) = 1 - t^{-2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{t^2}\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find critical points:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{1}{t^2} = 0 \\implies t^2 = 1\n$$\nSince time $t$ must be positive, the only solution is $t = 1 \\, \\text{h}$.\nTo confirm this is a minimum, we evaluate the second derivative of $R(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2R}{dt^2} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(1 - t^{-2}\\right) = 2 t^{-3} = \\frac{2}{t^3}\n$$\nAt $t=1$, the second derivative is $\\frac{d^2R}{dt^2}\\Big|_{t=1} = \\frac{2}{1^3} = 2$. Since the second derivative is positive, the critical point corresponds to a local minimum. As this is the only critical point for $t0$, it is the global minimum.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding enzyme amount $U$ using the constraint equation $U t = 10$:\n$$\nU(1) = 10 \\implies U = 10 \\, \\text{U}\n$$\nThus, the optimal conditions to achieve the desired digestion completeness while minimizing the risk of star activity are an incubation time of $t=1$ hour and an enzyme amount of $U=10$ units.
