The formula is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TMB} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{somatic}}}{L_{\\mathrm{callable}}}\n$$\n\n**1. Baseline TMB Calculation**\n\nWe are given $N_{\\mathrm{somatic}} = 120$ and the baseline callable length $L_{\\mathrm{callable}} = 1.2 \\ \\mathrm{Mb}$. The baseline TMB, denoted as $\\mathrm{TMB}_{\\mathrm{baseline}}$, is calculated as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TMB}_{\\mathrm{baseline}} = \\frac{120}{1.2} = 100 \\ \\text{mutations/Mb}\n$$\nFollowing the instruction to round to four significant figures, we express this as $100.0$ mutations/Mb.\n\n**2. Sensitivity Analysis**\n\nThe problem asks to analyze the effect of a $10\\%$ reduction in the callable region. Let the new callable length be $L'_{\\mathrm{callable}}$. This reduction of $10\\%$, or a factor of $0.10$, is calculated as:\n$$\nL'_{\\mathrm{callable}} = L_{\\mathrm{callable}} - (0.10 \\times L_{\\mathrm{callable}}) = (1 - 0.10) \\times L_{\\mathrm{callable}} = 0.90 \\times L_{\\mathrm{callable}}\n$$\nSubstituting the value of $L_{\\mathrm{callable}}$:\n$$\nL'_{\\mathrm{callable}} = 0.90 \\times 1.2 \\ \\mathrm{Mb} = 1.08 \\ \\mathrm{Mb}\n$$\nThe problem explicitly states to assume that $N_{\\mathrm{somatic}}$ is unchanged, so for this calculation, we still use $N_{\\mathrm{somatic}} = 120$. This assumption isolates the mathematical consequence of altering the denominator, which is central to understanding the stability of the TMB metric. The new TMB, denoted as $\\mathrm{TMB}_{\\mathrm{new}}$, is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TMB}_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\frac{120}{1.08} = \\frac{12000}{108} = \\frac{1000}{9} \\approx 111.111... \\ \\text{mutations/Mb}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the new TMB is $111.1$ mutations/Mb.\n\n**3. Multiplicative Factor Calculation**\n\nThe multiplicative factor, $F$, by which the TMB changes is the ratio of the new TMB to the baseline TMB:\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\mathrm{TMB}_{\\mathrm{new}}}{\\mathrm{TMB}_{\\mathrm{baseline}}}\n$$\nWe can substitute the symbolic expressions to derive a general relationship:\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{somatic}}}{L'_{\\mathrm{callable}}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{somatic}}}{L_{\\mathrm{callable}}}\\right)} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{somatic}}}{0.90 \\times L_{\\mathrm{callable}}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{somatic}}}{L_{\\mathrm{callable}}}\\right)}\n$$\nThe terms $N_{\\mathrm{somatic}}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{callable}}$ cancel out, leaving:\n$$\nF = \\frac{1}{0.90}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates the inverse proportionality between TMB and the callable length, as stated in the problem. To express this factor as a simplified exact fraction, we convert the decimal to a fraction:\n$$\n0.90 = \\frac{90}{100} = \\frac{9}{10}\n$$\nTherefore, the multiplicative factor is:\n$$\nF = \\frac{1}{\\frac{9}{10}} = \\frac{10}{9}\n$$\nThis is the final required answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{10}{9}}$$", "id": "5169530"}, {"introduction": "A TMB value is not a deterministic quantity but a statistical estimate subject to sampling error, especially when derived from a small number of observed mutations.

The tasks are sequential and logically connected, concerning the estimation of Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) from sequencing data. We will address each task in order.\n\nLet $\\lambda$ be the true TMB, defined as the mean number of somatic mutations per megabase (Mb). The somatic mutation process is modeled as a Poisson process. For a sequenced region of length $L$ in megabases, the number of observed somatic mutations, $N$, follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu = \\lambda L$. That is, $N \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda L)$.\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\n-   Length of the targeted sequencing panel: $L_1 = 0.5$ Mb.\n-   Observed number of nonsynonymous somatic mutations: $N_1 = 15$.\n-   Confidence level for interval estimation: $95\\%$, which corresponds to $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n-   Length of the whole-exome sequencing (WES) territory: $L_2 = 30$ Mb.\n\n**Task 1: Point Estimate of TMB**\n\nThe parameter of interest is the mutation rate $\\lambda$. The observed data is $N_1 = 15$ mutations in a region of length $L_1 = 0.5$ Mb. The expected number of mutations in this region is $\\mu_1 = \\lambda L_1$.\nThe maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the mean of a Poisson distribution is the observed count. Therefore, the point estimate for $\\mu_1$ is $\\hat{\\mu}_1 = N_1 = 15$.\n\nFrom the relationship $\\mu_1 = \\lambda L_1$, we can derive the point estimate for $\\lambda$, denoted $\\hat{\\lambda}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\hat{\\mu}_1}{L_1} = \\frac{N_1}{L_1}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\hat{\\lambda} = \\frac{15}{0.5} = 30 \\text{ mutations/Mb}\n$$\nThe problem asks for this result to be rounded to three significant figures. The point estimate of TMB is $30.0$ mutations/Mb.\n\n**Task 2: 95% Confidence Interval for TMB**\n\nTo find the confidence interval for TMB ($\\lambda$), we first construct an exact $95\\%$ confidence interval for the Poisson mean $\\mu_1$ based on the observation $N_1 = 15$. The standard exact method, known as the Clopper-Pearson interval, is based on the relationship between the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Poisson distribution and the CDF of the chi-squared ($\\chi^2$) distribution.\n\nFor an observed count of $k$, the exact $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$ confidence interval for the mean $\\mu$ is given by $[\\mu_L, \\mu_U]$, where:\n$$\n\\mu_L = \\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{\\alpha/2, 2k} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mu_U = \\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{1-\\alpha/2, 2(k+1)}\n$$\nHere, $\\chi^2_{p, \\nu}$ is the $p$-th percentile of the chi-squared distribution with $\\nu$ degrees of freedom.\n\nIn our case, $k = N_1 = 15$ and $\\alpha = 0.05$. Thus, $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$ and $1-\\alpha/2 = 0.975$.\nThe degrees of freedom for the lower bound are $2k = 2(15) = 30$.\nThe degrees of freedom for the upper bound are $2(k+1) = 2(15+1) = 32$.\n\nThe interval for $\\mu_1$ is:\n$$\n\\mu_{1,L} = \\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{0.025, 30}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{1,U} = \\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{0.975, 32}\n$$\nUsing standard statistical tables or software for the chi-squared critical values:\n$$\n\\chi^2_{0.025, 30} \\approx 16.791\n$$\n$$\n\\chi^2_{0.975, 32} \\approx 49.480\n$$\nSubstituting these values to find the interval for $\\mu_1$:\n$$\n\\mu_{1,L} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(16.791) = 8.3955\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{1,U} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(49.480) = 24.740\n$$\nSo, the $95\\%$ confidence interval for the expected number of mutations in the $0.5$ Mb region is approximately $[8.3955, 24.740]$.\n\nTo obtain the confidence interval for the TMB, $\\lambda = \\mu_1/L_1$, we divide the endpoints of the interval for $\\mu_1$ by the region length $L_1 = 0.5$ Mb:\n$$\n\\text{CI}_{\\lambda} = \\left[ \\frac{\\mu_{1,L}}{L_1}, \\frac{\\mu_{1,U}}{L_1} \\right] = \\left[ \\frac{8.3955}{0.5}, \\frac{24.740}{0.5} \\right] = [16.791, 49.480]\n$$\nRounding each endpoint to three significant figures, the $95\\%$ confidence interval for TMB is $[16.8, 49.5]$ mutations/Mb.\n\n**Task 3: Fold-Reduction in Confidence Interval Half-Width**\n\nThis task requires deriving the expected fold-reduction in the CI half-width when moving from the panel of length $L_1 = 0.5$ Mb to an exome-scale assay of length $L_2 = 30$ Mb.

This matches the problem's formulation to compute $\\mathbb{P}(X \\leq \\lfloor v_c D \\rfloor)$, as $\\lfloor 1.5 \\rfloor = 1$.\n\nWe need to calculate $\\mathbb{P}(X \\leq 1)$ for $X \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(30, 0.18)$.\nThe probability is the sum of the probabilities of observing $0$ or $1$ alternate reads:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(X \\leq 1) = \\mathbb{P}(X=0) + \\mathbb{P}(X=1)$$\nThe probability mass function for a binomial distribution is $\\mathbb{P}(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p_{binom}^k (1-p_{binom})^{n-k}$, where $n=D=30$ and $p_{binom}=\\mu=0.18$.\n\nFor $k=0$:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(X=0) = \\binom{30}{0} (0.18)^0 (1-0.18)^{30-0} = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (0.82)^{30}$$\nFor $k=1$:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(X=1) = \\binom{30}{1} (0.18)^1 (1-0.18)^{30-1} = 30 \\cdot (0.18) \\cdot (0.82)^{29}$$\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculation:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(X \\leq 1) = (0.82)^{30} + 30 \\cdot (0.18) \\cdot (0.82)^{29}$$\n$$\\mathbb{P}(X \\leq 1) = (0.82)^{30} + 5.4 \\cdot (0.82)^{29}$$\nWe can factor out $(0.82)^{29}$:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(X \\leq 1) = (0.82)^{29} (0.82 + 5.4) = (0.82)^{29} (6.22)$$\n\nCalculating the values:\n$$(0.82)^{30} \\approx 0.0025971$$\n$$30 \\cdot (0.18) \\cdot (0.82)^{29} \\approx 5.4 \\cdot (0.0031672) \\approx 0.0171029$$\n$$\\mathbb{P}(X \\leq 1) \\approx 0.0025971 + 0.0171029 = 0.0197000$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $0.01970$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.01970}$$", "id": "5169461"}]}
