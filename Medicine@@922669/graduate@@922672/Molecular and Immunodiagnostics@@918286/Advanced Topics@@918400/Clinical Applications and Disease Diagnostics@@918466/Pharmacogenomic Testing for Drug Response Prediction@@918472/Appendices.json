This is specified to mean \"two copies of the *1 allele on one chromosome and a single *4 allele on the other chromosome.\"\n-   **Allele Activity Values**: The normalized functional contribution for the *1 allele is $1.0$. The normalized functional contribution for the *4 allele is $0.0$.\n-   **Fundamental Principles**:\n    1.  **Gene Dosage**: Genetic copy number proportionally scales messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and enzyme abundance.\n    2.  **Additivity**: Independent allele contributions to catalytic capacity are additive.\n    3.  **Duplication Rule**: The contribution of a duplicated allele is its base activity value multiplied by its copy number.\n-   **Objective**: Compute the *CYP2D6* activity score for the specified diplotype.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is firmly rooted in the established clinical field of pharmacogenomics. The use of star allele nomenclature (* alleles) for the *CYP2D6* gene, the concept of copy number variation (CNV), and the calculation of an activity score to predict metabolic phenotype are standard practices in molecular diagnostics. The activity values assigned to the *1 (normal function) and *4 (no function) alleles are correct and widely accepted. The principles of gene dosage and additivity are the foundational assumptions for this scoring system. The problem is scientifically sound and factually correct.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides an unambiguous diplotype, specific activity values for each allele type, and a clear, deterministic algorithm for combining these values (summation of contributions from each chromosome, with multiplication for copy number). This structure leads to a unique and meaningful numerical solution.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe total *CYP2D6* activity score, which we denote as $S_{\\text{activity}}$, is calculated by summing the contributions from each of the two haplotypes (the set of alleles on each chromosome). The patient's diplotype is given as *1x2/*4. This represents two haplotypes: Haplotype A, which is *1x2, and Haplotype B, which is *4.\n\nLet $S_A$ be the activity score contribution from Haplotype A and $S_B$ be the contribution from Haplotype B. The total activity score is given by the principle of additivity:\n$$S_{\\text{activity}} = S_A + S_B$$\n\nWe must first calculate the contribution of each haplotype.\n\n**1. Contribution of Haplotype A (*1x2)**\nThis notation signifies that the *1 allele is present in two copies on this chromosome due to a gene duplication event. According to the stated duplication rule, the contribution of this haplotype is the activity score of the base allele multiplied by its copy number.\nLet $v(*1)$ be the activity value of the *1 allele, and let $n_A$ be its copy number on this haplotype.\n-   The activity value for the *1 allele is given as $v(*1) = 1.0$.\n-   The copy number is given as $n_A = 2$.\n\nThe contribution from Haplotype A is:\n$$S_A = v(*1) \\times n_A = 1.0 \\times 2 = 2.0$$\n\n**2. Contribution of Haplotype B (*4)**\nThis haplotype consists of a single copy of the *4 allele.\nLet $v(*4)$ be the activity value of the *4 allele. The copy number is implicitly $n_B = 1$.\n-   The activity value for the *4 allele is given as $v(*4) = 0.0$.\n-   The copy number is $n_B = 1$.\n\nThe contribution from Haplotype B is:\n$$S_B = v(*4) \\times n_B = 0.0 \\times 1 = 0.0$$\n\n**3. Total Activity Score**\nFinally, we sum the contributions from both haplotypes to find the total activity score for the diplotype.\n$$S_{\\text{activity}} = S_A + S_B = 2.0 + 0.0 = 2.0$$\n\nThe resulting *CYP2D6* activity score is a dimensionless real number, as required. This score is commonly used to classify the patient's metabolic phenotype. In this case, a score of $2.0$ typically corresponds to a normal metabolizer, despite the presence of a non-functional allele, because the duplication of the functional allele compensates for it.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.0}$$", "id": "5146988"}, {"introduction": "A patient's genetically-predicted phenotype is not an immutable trait; it can be significantly altered by external factors, most notably co-administered drugs.

The solution must be derived from the fundamental principles of carrier-mediated transport kinetics.\n\nFirst, we establish the kinetic model. The process of transporter-mediated influx is described by the mass-action scheme, where a substrate ($S$) binds reversibly to a transporter ($T$) to form a transporter-substrate complex ($TS$), which then facilitates the translocation of the substrate across the membrane, releasing the substrate on the interior and regenerating the free transporter. This can be represented as:\n$$ T + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} TS \\stackrel{k_2}{\\longrightarrow} T + S_{\\text{internal}} $$\nHere, $k_1$ is the rate constant for association, $k_{-1}$ is the rate constant for dissociation, and $k_2$ is the rate constant for the translocation and substrate release step, also known as the turnover number.\n\nThe influx rate, $J$, is the rate of appearance of the substrate inside the cell, which is determined by the rate of the translocation step:\n$$ J = k_2 [TS] $$\nwhere $[TS]$ is the concentration of the transporter-substrate complex.\n\nUnder the steady-state assumption, the concentration of the $[TS]$ complex is constant, meaning its rate of formation equals its rate of breakdown:\n$$ \\text{Rate of formation} = k_1 [T] [S] $$\n$$ \\text{Rate of breakdown} = k_{-1} [TS] + k_2 [TS] = (k_{-1} + k_2) [TS] $$\nEquating these gives:\n$$ k_1 [T] [S] = (k_{-1} + k_2) [TS] $$\nThe total concentration of the transporter, $[T]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the free transporter $[T]$ and the bound transporter $[TS]$:\n$$ [T]_{\\text{total}} = [T] + [TS] \\implies [T] = [T]_{\\text{total}} - [TS] $$\nSubstituting the expression for $[T]$ into the steady-state equation:\n$$ k_1 ([T]_{\\text{total}} - [TS]) [S] = (k_{-1} + k_2) [TS] $$\nRearranging to solve for $[TS]$:\n$$ k_1 [T]_{\\text{total}} [S] - k_1 [TS] [S] = (k_{-1} + k_2) [TS] $$\n$$ k_1 [T]_{\\text{total}} [S] = (k_{-1} + k_2 + k_1 [S]) [TS] $$\nDividing by $k_1$ on the right side:\n$$ [T]_{\\text{total}} [S] = \\left( \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} + [S] \\right) [TS] $$\nThe Michaelis constant, $K_m$, is defined as the ratio of rate constants $K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}$. It represents the substrate concentration at which the transport rate is half of its maximum.
