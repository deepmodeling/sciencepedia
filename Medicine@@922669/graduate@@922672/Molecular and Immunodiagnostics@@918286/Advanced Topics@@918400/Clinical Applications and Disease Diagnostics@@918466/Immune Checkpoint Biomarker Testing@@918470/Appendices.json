It provides all necessary data for the calculation of standard, clinically relevant biomarkers in immuno-oncology and asks for a standard interpretation of the results. All provided values are plausible within a clinical diagnostic context.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two distinct biomarker scores, the Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) and the Combined Positive Score (CPS), based on cell counts from an Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of a gastric adenocarcinoma specimen.\n\nFirst, we define the variables from the provided data:\n- Number of PD-L1–positive tumor cells, $N_{TC+} = 312$.\n- Number of PD-L1–positive lymphocytes, $N_{L+} = 480$.\n- Number of PD-L1–positive macrophages, $N_{M+} = 160$.\n- Total number of viable tumor cells, $N_{TC,total} = 1250$.\n\nThe Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) is defined as the ratio of the number of PD-L1–positive tumor cells to the total number of viable tumor cells. Conventionally, this is expressed as a percentage, but the problem requests a decimal value. The formula is:\n$$\n\\text{TPS} = \\frac{N_{TC+}}{N_{TC,total}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\text{TPS} = \\frac{312}{1250} = 0.2496\n$$\nThis value has exactly four significant figures, so no rounding is necessary.\n\nThe Combined Positive Score (CPS) is defined as the ratio of the number of all PD-L1–positive cells (including tumor cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages) to the total number of viable tumor cells. Note that the denominator for CPS is still the total number of viable tumor cells, not the total of all cell types. The formula is:\n$$\n\\text{CPS} = \\frac{N_{TC+} + N_{L+} + N_{M+}}{N_{TC,total}}\n$$\nFirst, we sum the number of all PD-L1–positive cells in the numerator:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator (CPS)} = 312 + 480 + 160 = 952\n$$\nNow, we calculate the CPS:\n$$\n\\text{CPS} = \\frac{952}{1250} = 0.7616\n$$\nThis value also has exactly four significant figures, so no rounding is required.\n\nThe computed values are a TPS of $0.2496$ and a CPS of $0.7616$.\n\nThe interpretation of the discordance between these two values is rooted in the biological compartments they measure. The TPS of $0.2496$ signifies that approximately $25\\%$ of the tumor cells express PD-L1. In contrast, the much higher CPS of $0.7616$ indicates that when PD-L1-expressing immune cells (lymphocytes and macrophages) are included in the numerator, the score increases substantially. The discordance—where CPS is significantly greater than TPS—arises because the majority of the PD-L1 expression in this tumor microenvironment originates from the immune cell infiltrate, not from the cancer cells themselves. The number of PD-L1-positive immune cells ($480 + 160 = 640$) is more than double the number of PD-L1-positive tumor cells ($312$).\n\nDiagnostically and biologically, this finding is critical. A high TPS indicates that the tumor may be using an intrinsic mechanism of immune evasion by upregulating PD-L1 on its own surface. A high CPS, particularly when discordant with a lower TPS, points towards an \"inflamed\" or \"immune-hot\" tumor microenvironment where infiltrating immune cells are the primary source of the PD-L1 checkpoint protein. This expression on immune cells can still lead to the suppression of cytotoxic T-cell activity. For certain cancers, such as gastric adenocarcinoma, CPS is the preferred biomarker for predicting response to immunotherapy. This is because therapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis can be effective by blocking these interactions, regardless of whether the PD-L1 is on a tumor cell or an immune cell. The discordance observed here highlights that focusing solely on tumor cell PD-L1 expression (TPS) would fail to capture the full extent of checkpoint-mediated immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment, potentially misclassifying a patient who could benefit from immunotherapy.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.2496 & 0.7616 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5120518"}, {"introduction": "The development and adoption of new diagnostic assays require rigorous validation against existing standards to ensure consistent patient classification.

It is scientifically grounded in the field of clinical immunodiagnostics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objective in its formulation.

The formula is:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{p_o - p_e}{1 - p_e}\n$$\nHere, $p_o$ is the observed proportional agreement, and $p_e$ is the expected probability of chance agreement.\n\nFirst, we calculate the observed agreement, $p_o$.

Derivation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and its Sampling Variance**\n\nLet the true Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) be denoted by the rate parameter $\\lambda$, representing the number of mutations per megabase (Mb). The genomic territory assayed by the panel has a length of $L$ megabases. The problem states to assume that mutations arise from a homogeneous Poisson process. Under this assumption, the total number of mutations, $N$, observed within the assayed length $L$ follows a Poisson distribution with a mean parameter $\\mu = \\lambda L$. The Probability Mass Function (PMF) for observing $n$ mutations is given by:\n$$\nP(N=n | \\mu) = \\frac{e^{-\\mu} \\mu^{n}}{n!}\n$$\nGiven an observed mutation count $N$, the likelihood function for the parameter $\\mu$ is the PMF viewed as a function of the parameter:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\mu | N) = \\frac{e^{-\\mu} \\mu^{N}}{N!}\n$$\nSince the parameter of interest is $\\lambda$, and $\\mu = \\lambda L$, we express the likelihood in terms of $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\lambda | N, L) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda L} (\\lambda L)^{N}}{N!}\n$$\nTo find the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) for $\\lambda$, which we denote as $\\hat{\\lambda}_{MLE}$, we maximize this likelihood function. It is mathematically more convenient to maximize the natural logarithm of the likelihood, known as the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(\\lambda)$.\n$$\n\\ell(\\lambda) = \\ln(\\mathcal{L}(\\lambda | N, L)) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{e^{-\\lambda L} (\\lambda L)^{N}}{N!} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\ell(\\lambda) = -\\lambda L + N \\ln(\\lambda L) - \\ln(N!)\n$$\n$$\n\\ell(\\lambda) = -\\lambda L + N(\\ln \\lambda + \\ln L) - \\ln(N!)\n$$\nTo find the maximum, we take the first derivative of $\\ell(\\lambda)$ with respect to $\\lambda$ and set it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ell}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\left( -\\lambda L + N\\ln\\lambda + N\\ln L - \\ln(N!) \\right) = -L + \\frac{N}{\\lambda}\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero provides the critical point:\n$$\n-L + \\frac{N}{\\hat{\\lambda}_{MLE}} = 0 \\implies \\frac{N}{\\hat{\\lambda}_{MLE}} = L\n$$\nSolving for $\\hat{\\lambda}_{MLE}$ yields the maximum likelihood estimator for the TMB:\n$$\n\\hat{\\lambda}_{MLE} = \\frac{N}{L}\n$$\nNext, we derive the sampling variance of this estimator. The variance of $\\hat{\\lambda}_{MLE}$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda}_{MLE}) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{N}{L}\\right)\n$$\nSince $L$ is a fixed constant representing the panel size, we use the property $\\text{Var}(cX) = c^2\\text{Var}(X)$:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda}_{MLE}) = \\frac{1}{L^2} \\text{Var}(N)\n$$\nA fundamental property of the Poisson distribution is that its variance is equal to its mean.

Substituting this into the variance expression for the estimator gives the true sampling variance:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda}_{MLE}) = \\frac{1}{L^2} (\\lambda L) = \\frac{\\lambda}{L}\n$$\nIn practice, the true rate $\\lambda$ is unknown. Therefore, we estimate the sampling variance by substituting the MLE, $\\hat{\\lambda}_{MLE}$, for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\lambda}_{MLE}) = \\frac{\\hat{\\lambda}_{MLE}}{L} = \\frac{N/L}{L} = \\frac{N}{L^2}\n$$\nThe standard error (SE) is the square root of the estimated sampling variance:\n$$\nSE(\\hat{\\lambda}_{MLE}) = \\sqrt{\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\lambda}_{MLE})} = \\sqrt{\\frac{N}{L^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N}}{L}\n$$\n\n**2.

A two-sided confidence interval with level $1-\\alpha$ is given by $\\hat{\\lambda} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\times SE(\\hat{\\lambda})$.\nFor a $95\\%$ confidence level, $\\alpha = 0.05$, so $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$. The corresponding critical value from the standard normal distribution is $z_{0.025} \\approx 1.96$.\nThe margin of error ($ME$) is:\n$$\nME = z_{0.025} \\times SE(\\hat{\\lambda}) \\approx 1.96 \\times 3.53553 \\approx 6.92964\n$$\nThe confidence interval is calculated as:\n$$\nCI_{0.95} = [\\hat{\\lambda} - ME, \\hat{\\lambda} + ME]\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Lower Bound} = 15 - 6.92964 = 8.07036\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Upper Bound} = 15 + 6.92964 = 21.92964\n$$\nRounding the lower and upper bounds to three significant figures as requested:\n$$\nCI_{0.95} = [8.07, 21.9] \\text{ mutations/Mb}\n$$\n\n**3. Discussion on Panel Design, Bias, and Variance**\n\nThe validity of the TMB estimate $\\hat{\\lambda} = N/L$ depends critically on the assumptions of the Poisson model, particularly the assumption of a *homogeneous* mutation rate across the genome. Panel size and gene selection can introduce complexities that violate this assumption, affecting both the variance and potential bias of the estimate.\n\n**Effect of Panel Size ($L$)**:\nFrom our derivation, the sampling variance of the TMB estimate is $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda}) = \\lambda/L$. This expression shows that the variance of the estimator is inversely proportional to the assayed panel size $L$. A larger panel provides a larger sample of the genome, which reduces the statistical uncertainty (sampling error) of the estimate, leading to a smaller variance and a narrower confidence interval. This increases the precision of the TMB measurement. Under the homogeneity assumption, the estimator is unbiased regardless of panel size, since $E[\\hat{\\lambda}] = E[N/L] = (1/L)E[N] = (1/L)(\\lambda L) = \\lambda$.\n\n**Effect of Gene Selection (Non-Uniformity and Bias)**:\nThe assumption of a uniform mutation rate $\\lambda$ across the genome is a significant simplification. True mutation rates vary widely between genomic regions due to factors like chromatin state, replication timing, sequence context, and DNA repair efficiency. Targeted sequencing panels are not random samples; they are deliberately enriched for genes of clinical or biological interest (e.g., oncogenes, tumor suppressors). This non-random selection can introduce bias if the average mutation rate of the genes on the panel differs from the true average rate of the broader genomic region of interest (e.g., the whole exome).\n\nTo formalize this, consider a scenario where the assayed region $L$ is composed of $k$ distinct sub-regions (e.g., genes) with lengths $L_i$ and true, non-uniform mutation rates $\\lambda_i$, such that $L = \\sum_{i=1}^k L_i$. The total expected number of mutations is $E[N] = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_i L_i$. The expected value of our estimator $\\hat{\\lambda} = N/L$ is:\n$$\nE[\\hat{\\lambda}] = \\frac{E[N]}{L} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_i L_i}{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_i \\frac{L_i}{L}\n$$\nThis quantity is the length-weighted average of mutation rates across the panel, let's call it $\\bar{\\lambda}_p$. If the clinical goal is to estimate a global TMB, for instance, the whole-exome TMB $\\lambda_{global}$, then the bias $B$ of the panel-based estimate is:\n$$\nB = E[\\hat{\\lambda}] - \\lambda_{global} = \\bar{\\lambda}_p - \\lambda_{global} = \\left( \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_i L_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^k L_i} \\right) - \\lambda_{global}\n$$\nThis symbolic expression shows that bias arises if the panel's gene content is not representative of the genomic region for which TMB is being generalized. For example, if the panel over-represents mutational hotspots (genes where $\\lambda_i > \\lambda_{global}$), the TMB estimate will be systematically inflated ($B > 0$). Conversely, a panel focusing on highly conserved genes might underestimate the global TMB ($B  0$). This demonstrates a violation of the Poisson model's independence and constant rate assumptions in a practical setting, where gene-to-gene mutation rates are not independent draws from a single distribution. The variance is also affected. Assuming independence between regions, $\\text{Var}(N) = \\sum \\text{Var}(N_i) = \\sum \\lambda_i L_i$, so $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda}) = (\\sum \\lambda_i L_i) / L^2 = \\bar{\\lambda}_p / L$. Therefore, a panel enriched for hypermutated genes will not only produce a biased estimate but also one with higher variance compared to a panel of the same size targeting regions with lower average mutation rates.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 15.00  3.54  8.07  21.9 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5120522"}]}
