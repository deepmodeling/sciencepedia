This exercise not only reinforces the core calculations but also introduces a critical layer of analysis: assessing whether a low-level signal is statistically robust enough to be considered quantifiable, a crucial step in avoiding the over-interpretation of noise.", "problem": "A laboratory is performing Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) monitoring using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) for a leukemia-specific target normalized to a control gene. The following experimentally supported foundations apply:\n- In Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), if the per-cycle amplification efficiency is $E$, then the number of target molecules after $c$ cycles is $N(c) = N_{0} E^{c}$, where $N_{0}$ is the initial number of target molecules.\n- In qPCR, detection occurs when the amplified product reaches a fixed fluorescence threshold $N_{\\mathrm{T}}$ at the quantification cycle $C_q$, satisfying $N_{0} E^{C_q} = N_{\\mathrm{T}}$, which implies $C_q = \\frac{\\ln(N_{\\mathrm{T}}/N_{0})}{\\ln(E)}$.\n- Therefore, plotting $C_q$ versus $\\log_{10}(N_{0})$ yields a linear standard curve with slope $m = -\\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(E)}$. For $E \\approx 2$, $m \\approx -3.3$, consistent with efficient amplification.\n\nAn assay is calibrated such that a sample with $C_q = 36$ corresponds to $N_{t} = 3$ initial target copies.

The problem requires this decimal to be rounded to two significant figures. The first significant figure is $3$. To represent two significant figures, we must add a trailing zero, which gives $0.000030$. In scientific notation, this is expressed as $3.0 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\n**2. Computation of the Quantifiability Indicator**\n\nThe quantifiability of the measurement is assessed based on the relative Poisson standard uncertainty, $r$. This metric is derived from treating the initial target copy count, $N_{t}$, as a Poisson random variable.\n\nThe standard deviation, $\\sigma$, of a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$ (here, the best estimate is the measured value $N_{t}$) is $\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\lambda} = \\sqrt{N_{t}}$.\nThe relative Poisson standard uncertainty, $r$, is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\sigma}{N_{t}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{N_{t}}}{N_{t}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N_{t}}}\n$$\nThe problem states that a measurement is \"quantifiable\" if $r \\le 0.30$ and \"not quantifiable\" otherwise.

The solution is formally expressed using quantiles of the Beta distribution, as the binomial CDF is related to the regularized incomplete beta function. The upper bound $U$ is the $1-\\alpha/2$ quantile of a Beta distribution with parameters $K+1$ and $N-K$.\n$$U = \\text{Beta.Inv}(1-\\alpha/2; K+1, N-K)$$\nFor cases like this where $N$ is very large and $K$ is small, the Binomial($N,p$) distribution is accurately approximated by the Poisson($\\lambda$) distribution, where $\\lambda = Np$.

It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of a specific ratio of posterior probabilities. Let the event of detecting the DNMT3A R882H mutation be denoted by $D$. The problem defines this as observing at least $k=5$ mutated Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs). Let $C$ be the event that the patient has DNMT3A R882H-driven CHIP, and $L$ be the event that the patient has residual leukemia.\n\nThe quantity to be calculated is given by:\n$$ \\frac{P(C \\wedge \\neg L \\mid D)}{P(C \\wedge \\neg L \\mid D) + P(\\neg C \\wedge L \\mid D)} $$\nThis expression represents the probability that the signal is from CHIP alone, conditioned on the fact that it must originate from one of two mutually exclusive sources: either CHIP alone ($C \\wedge \\neg L$) or leukemia alone ($\\neg C \\wedge L$).\n\nThe event $L$ in the context of a DNMT3A R882H detection ($D$) must implicitly mean a leukemia clone that carries this specific mutation, as a clone without it could not generate the signal. Let us denote the event of residual leukemia carrying the DNMT3A R882H mutation as $L_{mut}$. The problem states that the probability of a leukemia clone acquiring this mutation is $q=0.02$. Thus, we interpret the event \"$\\neg C \\wedge L$\" in the problem's formula as \"$\\neg C \\wedge L_{mut}$\".\n\nLet us define two mutually exclusive hypotheses to explain the origin of the detected signal:\n- $H_{1}$: The patient has CHIP but no leukemia. The signal is from CHIP. This corresponds to the event $C \\wedge \\neg L$.\n- $H_{2}$: The patient does not have CHIP but has residual leukemia carrying the DNMT3A R882H mutation. The signal is from leukemia. This corresponds to the event $\\neg C \\wedge L_{mut}$.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of a hypothesis $H_i$ given evidence $D$ is $P(H_i \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\mid H_i)P(H_i)}{P(D)}$.\nThe target expression can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\frac{P(H_1 \\mid D)}{P(H_1 \\mid D) + P(H_2 \\mid D)} = \\frac{\\frac{P(D \\mid H_1)P(H_1)}{P(D)}}{\\frac{P(D \\mid H_1)P(H_1)}{P(D)} + \\frac{P(D \\mid H_2)P(H_2)}{P(D)}} = \\frac{P(D \\mid H_1)P(H_1)}{P(D \\mid H_1)P(H_1) + P(D \\mid H_2)P(H_2)} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the prior probabilities of these two hypotheses, $P(H_1)$ and $P(H_2)$.\nThe prior probability of the patient having DNMT3A R882H-driven CHIP is given as $p_C$:\n$$ p_C = P(C) = 0.20 \\times 0.15 = 0.03 $$\nThe prior probability of the patient having residual leukemia is $p_L$:\n$$ p_L = P(L) = 0.10 $$\nThe problem states that $C$ and $L$ are independent events.\nThe prior probability of hypothesis $H_1$ is:\n$$ P(H_1) = P(C \\wedge \\neg L) = P(C)P(\\neg L) = p_C(1 - p_L) = 0.03 \\times (1 - 0.10) = 0.03 \\times 0.90 = 0.027 $$\n\nFor hypothesis $H_2$, we need the prior probability of having leukemia with the mutation, $P(L_{mut})$.\n$$ P(L_{mut}) = P(L_{mut} \\mid L)P(L) = q \\times p_L = 0.02 \\times 0.10 = 0.002 $$\nThe prior probability of hypothesis $H_2$ is:\n$$ P(H_2) = P(\\neg C \\wedge L_{mut}) = P(\\neg C)P(L_{mut}) = (1 - p_C)P(L_{mut}) = (1 - 0.03) \\times 0.002 = 0.97 \\times 0.002 = 0.00194 $$\n\nNext, we evaluate the likelihoods, $P(D \\mid H_1)$ and $P(D \\mid H_2)$. The event $D$ is the detection of the variant, which occurs if the number of mutated UMIs, $X$, is at least $k=5$. The number of mutated UMIs is modeled as a Poisson random variable, $X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$.\n\nThe problem states that the signal is detected at a VAF of $2 \\times 10^{-3}$. We assume this VAF is characteristic of the clone causing the signal, regardless of whether its origin is CHIP ($H_1$) or leukemia ($H_2$). The mean of the Poisson distribution, $\\lambda$, is the sum of the expected counts from the true clone and from background sequencing error.\nThe mean due to the biological signal is $N \\times \\text{VAF} = (5.0 \\times 10^3) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-3}) = 10$.\nThe mean due to background error is $N \\times \\epsilon = (5.0 \\times 10^3) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}) = 0.05$.\nSo, for both hypotheses, the total mean $\\lambda$ is:\n$$ \\lambda = 10 + 0.05 = 10.05 $$\nThe likelihood of detection under either hypothesis is the probability of observing $X \\ge 5$ from a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda=10.05$:\n$$ P(D \\mid H_1) = P(D \\mid H_2) = P(X \\ge 5 \\mid X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(10.05)) = 1 - \\sum_{i=0}^{4} \\frac{e^{-10.05} (10.05)^i}{i!} $$\nSince the likelihood term $P(D \\mid H_1)$ is equal to $P(D \\mid H_2)$, let's call it $L_D$. The expression for the desired probability simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{L_D \\times P(H_1)}{L_D \\times P(H_1) + L_D \\times P(H_2)} = \\frac{P(H_1)}{P(H_1) + P(H_2)} $$\nThe result depends only on the ratio of the prior probabilities. Substituting the calculated values for the priors:\n$$ \\frac{0.027}{0.027 + 0.00194} = \\frac{0.027}{0.02894} $$\nCalculating the final value:\n$$ \\frac{0.027}{0.02894} \\approx 0.93296475... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.9330$.\nThis result indicates that, given the pre-test probabilities and the observation, it is much more likely that the detected DNMT3A R882H mutation originates from CHIP than from an evolved leukemic subclone.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9330}$$", "id": "5133636"}]}
