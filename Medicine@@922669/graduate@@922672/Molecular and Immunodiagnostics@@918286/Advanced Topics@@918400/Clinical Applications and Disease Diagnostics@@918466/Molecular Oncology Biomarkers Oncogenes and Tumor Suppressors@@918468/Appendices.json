By working through a scenario with a diploid, copy-neutral locus, you will develop the core skill of using VAF to infer whether a mutation is clonal (present in all cancer cells) or subclonal, a critical distinction for understanding tumor evolution and therapeutic response.

It describes a standard calculation in cancer genomics based on established principles. All necessary information is provided, and the premises are consistent and realistic. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to derive the relationship between Variant Allele Frequency ($VAF$), tumor purity ($P$), and cellular prevalence ($f$) for a heterozygous mutation in a diploid locus, and then use this relationship to calculate $f$ from given values of $VAF$ and $P$.\n\nLet $P$ be the tumor purity, defined as the fraction of tumor cells in the specimen. The fraction of normal, non-cancerous cells is therefore $(1-P)$.\nLet $f$ be the cellular prevalence, also known as the Cancer Cell Fraction ($CCF$), defined as the fraction of tumor cells that harbor the specific genetic variant.\n\nWe are given the following assumptions:\n1.  The *KRAS* locus is diploid in both tumor and normal cell compartments. This means every cell contains exactly two alleles of the *KRAS* gene.\n2.  The mutation is a heterozygous substitution. This means that in a mutated cell, one allele is the variant (mutant) and one is the wild-type.\n3.  Normal cells do not carry the somatic mutation; they are homozygous wild-type.\n4.  There is no copy-number alteration at the locus, no allele-specific amplification, and equal sampling probability of all alleles.\n\nThe $VAF$ is the fraction of sequencing reads carrying the variant allele. Under the assumption of equal sampling, the $VAF$ is equal to the proportion of variant alleles out of the total number of alleles at that locus in the sequenced cell population.\n\nLet us model the allele content of the sample. We consider the contribution of alleles from the tumor compartment and the normal compartment separately.\n\nThe total pool of alleles at the *KRAS* locus is a mixture from two populations:\n1.  **Normal cells**: Constitute a fraction $(1-P)$ of the total cells. All cells are diploid and homozygous wild-type. Thus, they contribute zero variant alleles.\n2.  **Tumor cells**: Constitute a fraction $P$ of the total cells. This population is itself a mixture:\n    - A fraction $f$ of tumor cells are mutated. Since the mutation is heterozygous and the locus is diploid, each of these cells has one variant allele and one wild-type allele. The proportion of variant alleles in this sub-population is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n    - A fraction $(1-f)$ of tumor cells are not mutated (wild-type). These cells have two wild-type alleles and contribute zero variant alleles.\n\nThe total number of variant alleles in the sample is proportional to the number of mutated tumor cells. The number of mutated tumor cells is proportional to $P \\times f$. Each of these cells contributes one variant allele.\n\nThe total number of alleles at the locus in the sample is proportional to the total number of cells, with each cell contributing two alleles (due to diploidy).\n\nLet's formalize this. Consider a representative sample of $N$ total cells.\n-   Number of tumor cells = $P \\times N$.\n-   Number of normal cells = $(1-P) \\times N$.\n-   Number of tumor cells with the variant = $f \\times (P \\times N) = fPN$.\n-   Number of variant alleles contributed by mutated tumor cells = $1 \\times (fPN) = fPN$.\n-   Number of variant alleles contributed by normal cells = $0$.\n-   Total number of variant alleles in the sample = $fPN$.\n-   Total number of alleles at the locus from all cells = $2 \\times N$ (since all cells are diploid).\n\nThe $VAF$ is the ratio of the total number of variant alleles to the total number of all alleles:\n$$VAF = \\frac{\\text{Total variant alleles}}{\\text{Total alleles}} = \\frac{fPN}{2N}$$\nBy cancelling the variable $N$, we arrive at the general formula relating these quantities:\n$$VAF = \\frac{f \\times P}{2}$$\n\nThe first part of the problem asks for the expected $VAF$ under clonal heterozygosity. Clonal heterozygosity is defined as the variant being present in $100\\%$ of tumor cells. This corresponds to a cellular prevalence of $f=1$.\nSubstituting $f=1$ into our derived formula gives:\n$$VAF_{\\text{clonal}} = \\frac{1 \\times P}{2} = \\frac{P}{2}$$\nGiven the tumor purity $P = 0.60$, the expected $VAF$ for a clonal heterozygous mutation would be:\n$$VAF_{\\text{clonal}} = \\frac{0.60}{2} = 0.30$$\n\nThe second part of the problem asks to derive the cellular prevalence $f$ that is consistent with an observed $VAF$. We can rearrange our general formula to solve for $f$:\n$$VAF = \\frac{f \\times P}{2}$$\n$$2 \\times VAF = f \\times P$$\n$$f = \\frac{2 \\times VAF}{P}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the cellular prevalence $f$.\n\nWe are given an observed $VAF$ of $0.18$ and a tumor purity $P$ of $0.60$. We substitute these values into the expression for $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{2 \\times 0.18}{0.60}$$\n$$f = \\frac{0.36}{0.60}$$\n$$f = \\frac{36}{60} = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe Variant Allele Fraction, $v$, is defined as the ratio of the total number of variant allele copies to the total number of all allele copies at the specific locus within the entire sample. We can formulate this relationship by considering a representative sample composed of a mixture of tumor and normal cells. The total proportion of cells is $1$.\n\nFirst, we express the total number of variant allele copies in the sample. These copies exist only within a subpopulation of the tumor cells.\n- The proportion of tumor cells in the sample is $p$.\n- Within this tumor cell population, the proportion that harbors the variant is $f$.\n- In each of these variant-harboring tumor cells, there are $m$ copies of the variant allele.\n- Normal cells, which constitute a proportion $(1-p)$ of the sample, do not carry the variant.\nTherefore, the total expected number of variant allele copies, per cell in the composite sample, is given by the product of these factors:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator (variant copies)} = p \\cdot f \\cdot m\n$$\n\nNext, we express the total number of all allele copies (both variant and wild-type) at the locus across the entire sample. This is the sum of copies from the tumor cell population and the normal cell population.\n- The proportion of tumor cells is $p$, and each has a total copy number of $C_t$. Their contribution to the total allele count is $p \\cdot C_t$.\n- The proportion of normal cells is $(1-p)$, and each has a total copy number of $C_n$. Their contribution to the total allele count is $(1-p) \\cdot C_n$.\nThe total expected number of allele copies at the locus, per cell in the composite sample, is the sum:\n$$\n\\text{Denominator (total copies)} = p \\cdot C_t + (1-p) \\cdot C_n\n$$\n\nThe VAF, $v$, is the ratio of the numerator to the denominator:\n$$\nv = \\frac{p \\cdot f \\cdot m}{p \\cdot C_t + (1-p) \\cdot C_n}\n$$\nThe problem requires us to solve this equation for the cancer cell fraction, $f$. To do this, we perform an algebraic rearrangement.

The general formula is:\n$$ \\mathrm{VAF} = \\frac{N_{\\text{mutant}}}{N_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{p \\cdot m_t + (1-p) \\cdot m_n}{p \\cdot C_t + (1-p) \\cdot C_n} $$\nwhere:\n- $p = 0.60$ is the tumor purity.\n- $1-p = 0.40$ is the normal cell fraction.\n- $m_t$ is the number of mutant alleles in a tumor cell at the locus.\n- $m_n$ is the number of mutant alleles in a normal cell at the locus.\n- $C_t$ is the total copy number of the locus in a tumor cell.\n- $C_n$ is the total copy number of the locus in a normal cell, assumed to be diploid ($C_n = 2$).\n\nWe will calculate the expected VAF for a heterozygous germline variant ($m_n = 1$) and a clonal heterozygous somatic variant ($m_n = 0$, $m_t$ is typically $1$ initially) for each copy number state.\n\n### Case 1: Copy-Neutral Diploid, No LOH ($C_t = 2$)\nThe denominator is $p \\cdot C_t + (1-p) \\cdot C_n = (0.60 \\cdot 2) + (0.40 \\cdot 2) = 1.2 + 0.8 = 2.0$.\n- **Germline (het)**: The variant is present in all cells. Normal cells have one mutant allele ($m_n=1$). Tumor cells also retain the heterozygous state ($m_t=1$).\n  $$ \\mathrm{VAF}_{\\text{germ}} = \\frac{0.60 \\cdot 1 + 0.40 \\cdot 1}{2.0} = \\frac{1.0}{2.0} = 0.50 $$\n- **Somatic (het)**: The variant is only in tumor cells ($m_n=0$), with one mutant allele ($m_t=1$).\n  $$ \\mathrm{VAF}_{\\text{som}} = \\frac{0.60 \\cdot 1 + 0.40 \\cdot 0}{2.0} = \\frac{0.60}{2.0} = 0.30 \\quad (= p/2) $$\n\n### Case 2: Hemizygous Deletion with LOH ($C_t = 1$)\nThe denominator is $p \\cdot C_t + (1-p) \\cdot C_n = (0.60 \\cdot 1) + (0.40 \\cdot 2) = 0.6 + 0.8 = 1.4$.\n- **Germline (het) with LOH**: The patient is heterozygous ($m_n=1$). In the tumor, the wild-type allele is lost, leaving only the mutant allele ($m_t=1, C_t=1$).\n  $$ \\mathrm{VAF}_{\\text{germ+LOH}} = \\frac{0.60 \\cdot 1 + 0.40 \\cdot 1}{1.4} = \\frac{1.0}{1.4} \\approx 0.714 \\quad (= 1/(2-p)) $$\n- **Somatic (het) with LOH**: A somatic mutation occurs, then the wild-type allele is lost.

In tumor cells, one of the original alleles is duplicated. This results in either one mutant and two wild-type alleles ($m_t=1$) or two mutant and one wild-type allele ($m_t=2$). We must consider both.\n- **Somatic (het)**: A somatic mutation creates a heterozygous state in the tumor progenitor ($m_n=0$). Then a copy-gain occurs. For an activating oncogene (like *PIK3CA*), amplification of the mutant allele is possible ($m_t=2, C_t=3$). However, a simple gain of one chromosome copy could also duplicate the wild-type allele ($m_t=1, C_t=3$). For variant S4 (VAF=$0.19$), we will test the simplest model where one mutant allele is present in tumor cells.\n  $$ \\mathrm{VAF}_{\\text{som, } m_t=1} = \\frac{0.60 \\cdot 1 + 0.40 \\cdot 0}{2.6} = \\frac{0.60}{2.6} \\approx 0.231 $$\nThis expected VAF of $0.231$ is close to the observed VAF of $0.19$ for S4, so we will proceed with the assumption that $m_t=1$ for somatic events in this copy number state.\n\n### Summary of Theoretical VAFs and Variant Analysis\n- **S1 (*BRCA1*, CN=2)**: VAF=$0.49$. This is very close to the expected germline VAF of $0.50$. Goal: Germline.\n- **S2 (*KRAS*, CN=2)**: VAF=$0.31$. This is very close to the expected somatic VAF of $0.30$. Goal: Somatic.\n- **S3 (*TP53*, CN=1)**: VAF=$0.74$. This is very close to the expected germline+LOH VAF of $0.714$. Goal: Germline.\n- **S4 (*PIK3CA*, CN=3)**: VAF=$0.19$. This is close to the expected somatic VAF ($m_t=1$) of $0.231$. Goal: Somatic.\n- **S5 (*PMS2*, CN=1)**: VAF=$0.66$. This is closer to the expected germline+LOH VAF of $0.714$ than the somatic+LOH VAF of $0.429$. Goal: Germline.\n\nThe theoretical calculations corroborate the desired classifications. Now, we evaluate each policy.\n\n---\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Policy A**\n- **Population rule**: \"likely germline\" if MAF $\\ge 10^{-3}$.\n  - No variants meet this threshold (S1 MAF$=2 \\times 10^{-5}$, S5 MAF$=5 \\times 10^{-5}$, others are $0$). All variants proceed to VAF rules.\n- **S1 (Goal: Germline)**: CN-neutral, VAF=$0.49$. Rule: $\\lvert \\mathrm{VAF} - 0.50 \\rvert \\le 0.10$.\n  - Calculation: $\\lvert 0.49 - 0.50 \\rvert = 0.01$, which is $\\le 0.10$.\n  - Classification: **Likely Germline**. Correct.\n- **S2 (Goal: Somatic)**: CN-neutral, VAF=$0.31$. Rule: $\\lvert \\mathrm{VAF} - (p/2) \\rvert \\le 0.10$.\n  - Calculation: $p/2=0.30$. $\\lvert 0.31 - 0.30 \\rvert = 0.01$, which is $\\le 0.10$.\n  - Classification: **Likely Somatic**. Correct.\n- **S3 (Goal: Germline)**: Hemizygous LOH, VAF=$0.74$. Rule: $\\mathrm{VAF} \\ge \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2 - p}\\right) - 0.07$.\n  - Calculation: Threshold is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2 - 0.60}\\right) - 0.07 = \\dfrac{1}{1.4} - 0.07 \\approx 0.714 - 0.07 = 0.644$. VAF $0.74 \\ge 0.644$.\n  - Classification: **Likely Germline**. Correct.\n- **S4 (Goal: Somatic)**: Balanced gain, VAF=$0.19$. Rule: $\\mathrm{VAF} \\le \\dfrac{p \\cdot 1}{p \\cdot 3 + (1 - p)\\cdot 2} + 0.10$.\n  - Calculation: Threshold is $\\dfrac{0.60}{0.60 \\cdot 3 + 0.40 \\cdot 2} + 0.10 = \\dfrac{0.60}{2.6} + 0.10 \\approx 0.231 + 0.10 = 0.331$. VAF $0.19 \\le 0.331$.\n  - Classification: **Likely Somatic**. Correct.\n- **S5 (Goal: Germline)**: Hemizygous LOH, VAF=$0.66$. Rule: $\\mathrm{VAF} \\ge \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2 - p}\\right) - 0.07$.\n  - Calculation: Threshold is $0.644$. VAF $0.66 \\ge 0.644$.\n  - Classification: **Likely Germline**. Correct.\n\nAll five variants are classified correctly according to the problem requirements, and no uncertain classifications are produced. The formulas used in the policy are directly derived from the first-principles mixture model.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n---\n**B. Policy B**\n- **Population rule**: \"likely germline\" if MAF $\\ge 10^{-2}$. None qualify.\n- **CN-neutral diploid rules**:\n  - `“likely germline” if VAF in [0.25, 0.35]`\n  - `“likely somatic” if VAF in [0.45, 0.55]`\n  These rules are the reverse of the correct theoretical expectations. A VAF near $0.50$ is characteristic of a germline variant, while a VAF near $p/2=0.30$ is characteristic of a somatic variant.\n- **S1 (Goal: Germline)**: CN-neutral, VAF=$0.49$. The policy classifies this as \"likely somatic\" because $0.49$ is in the range $[0.45, 0.55]$. This is incorrect.\nThe fundamental logic of this policy is flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n---\n**C. Policy C**\n- **Population rule**: \"likely germline\" if MAF $\\ge 10^{-4}$. None qualify.\n- **S2 (Goal: Somatic)**: CN-neutral, VAF=$0.31$. Rule: `“likely somatic” if |VAF - p| ≤ 0.05`.\n  - Calculation: $p=0.60$. $\\lvert 0.31 - 0.60 \\rvert = 0.29$, which is not $\\le 0.05$.\n  - This rule is based on an incorrect theoretical VAF for a heterozygous somatic mutation, which should be $p/2$, not $p$. The policy fails to classify S2 as somatic. Since it also doesn't fit the germline rule ($\\lvert 0.31 - 0.50 \\rvert = 0.19 > 0.05$), S2 is left uncertain. The problem requires no uncertain classifications.\nThe somatic VAF rule for the copy-neutral case is theoretically incorrect and leads to an uncertain classification.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n---\n**D. Policy D**\n- **Population rule**: Not used.\n- **S5 (Goal: Germline)**: Hemizygous LOH, VAF=$0.66$. Rule: `“likely germline” if VAF ≥ 0.72` or `“likely somatic” if VAF ≤ 0.50`.\n  - Calculation: The VAF of $0.66$ does not satisfy either condition. $0.66 < 0.72$ and $0.66 > 0.50$.\n  - Therefore, this policy fails to classify S5. The problem requires that no variants are left uncertain.\nThe rules for the hemizygous deletion case leave a gap where S5 falls, resulting in an uncertain classification.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n---\n**Conclusion**\nOnly Policy A correctly applies theoretically sound VAF mixture models to classify all five variants as specified in the problem statement, without producing any uncertain results.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5135415"}]}
