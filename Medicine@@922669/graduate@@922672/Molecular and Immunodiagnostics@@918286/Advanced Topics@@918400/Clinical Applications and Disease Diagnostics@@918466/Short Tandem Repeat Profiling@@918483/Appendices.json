As your final reported result, compute the sum $S$ of the two integer repeat counts. State $S$ as an integer with no units. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular genetics, specifically Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and a clear, formalizable definition to arrive at a unique solution. The data provided are consistent and realistic.\n\nThe fundamental relationship governing the length of a PCR amplicon for an STR locus is given as:\n$$L = L_f + n \\cdot L_m$$\nwhere $L$ is the total length of the amplicon in base pairs (bp), $L_f$ is the constant length of the non-repetitive flanking sequences, $n$ is the integer number of tandem repeats, and $L_m$ is the length of the repeat motif.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nThe lengths of the two observed amplicons are $L_1 = 254$ bp and $L_2 = 262$ bp.\nThe length of the repeat motif is $L_m = 4$ bp.\nThe length of the constant flanking sequence is $L_f = 150$ bp.\n\nOur objective is to determine the integer repeat counts, $n_1$ and $n_2$, for the two respective alleles. We can rearrange the fundamental equation to solve for $n$:\n$$n \\cdot L_m = L - L_f$$\n$$n = \\frac{L - L_f}{L_m}$$\n\nFor the first allele with amplicon length $L_1 = 254$ bp, the number of repeats, $n_1$, is:\n$$n_1 = \\frac{L_1 - L_f}{L_m} = \\frac{254 - 150}{4}$$\n$$n_1 = \\frac{104}{4} = 26$$\nSince $n_1=26$ is an integer, this is a valid repeat count.\n\nFor the second allele with amplicon length $L_2 = 262$ bp, the number of repeats, $n_2$, is:\n$$n_2 = \\frac{L_2 - L_f}{L_m} = \\frac{262 - 150}{4}$$\n$$n_2 = \\frac{112}{4} = 28$$\nSince $n_2=28$ is an integer, this is also a valid repeat count.\n\nThe integer repeat counts for the two alleles are $26$ and $28$.\n\nAccording to standard STR nomenclature, alleles are named by their integer number of repeat units. Therefore, the allele with $26$ repeats is designated as allele \"$26$\", and the allele with $28$ repeats is designated as allele \"$28$\". A heterozygous individual with these two alleles would have the genotype $(26, 28)$.\n\nThe problem also asks for an explanation of how non-integer microvariants are denoted. Microvariants are alleles that contain incomplete repeat units. Their nomenclature uses a decimal point. The integer part of the designation represents the number of full repeats, and the number after the decimal point indicates the number of base pairs in the partial repeat. For example, if an allele at this locus (with a $4$-bp motif) consisted of $25$ full repeats and an additional partial repeat of $2$ bp, its total length would be $L_f + 25 \\cdot L_m + 2 = 150 + 25 \\cdot 4 + 2 = 150 + 100 + 2 = 252$ bp. This allele would be designated as allele \"$25.2$\". The number \"$2$\" after the decimal signifies the $2$ bp of the incomplete repeat, not a fractional part of the repeat unit itself (e.g., not $0.2 \\cdot 4$).\n\nFinally, the problem requires the computation of the sum $S$ of the two integer repeat counts determined for the observed alleles.\n$$S = n_1 + n_2$$\n$$S = 26 + 28 = 54$$\nThe sum of the two integer repeat counts is $54$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{54}$$", "id": "5161291"}, {"introduction": "A reliable STR profile interpretation requires distinguishing true allelic signals from background noise and accounting for the randomness inherent in amplifying low-template DNA.

This implies that $T_a$ must be greater than or equal to the $(1-\\alpha)$-quantile of the distribution of noise peak heights. The $(1-\\alpha)$-quantile is the value that is exceeded by only a fraction $\\alpha$ of the noise peaks.\n    Given $\\alpha = 10^{-3} = 0.001$, we require the $(1 - 0.001) = 0.999$ or $99.9\\%$ quantile of baseline noise. The problem provides this value: $Q_{1-\\alpha}(N) = 28$ RFU. Therefore, to meet this condition, we must have $T_a \\ge 28$ RFU.\n\n2.  **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) Constraint**: At the analytical threshold, the SNR must be at least $S_{\\min} = 3$. The SNR for a peak of height $H$ is defined as $SNR = H/N$, where $N$ is the local baseline noise height. For a peak at the threshold, this means $T_a / N \\ge S_{\\min} = 3$. The problem provides statistics for noise *peak heights*, not the underlying local baseline noise $N$. A conservative approach would be to ensure this condition holds even for high estimates of local noise.\n\nNow, we must evaluate how the options combine these principles. A straightforward approach would be to set $T_a = 28$ RFU, which satisfies the $\\alpha$ constraint directly, and then verify the SNR constraint. Assuming the local baseline noise $N$ is approximated by the median noise peak height ($8$ RFU), the SNR at $T_a=28$ RFU would be $28/8 = 3.5$, which is greater than $S_{\\min}=3$. While this value of $T_a=28$ RFU seems appropriate, it is not presented in any option.\n\nWe are tasked to select the option that *correctly defines* the thresholds. Let's analyze the logic presented in the options.\nOption A proposes the definition $T_a = S_{\\min} \\cdot Q_{1-\\alpha}(N)$. This can be interpreted as an extremely conservative application of the SNR rule, where a signal at the threshold ($T_a$) must have an SNR of at least $S_{\\min}$ relative to the highest plausible noise peak height, $Q_{1-\\alpha}(N)$. This yields $T_a = 3 \\times 28 \\text{ RFU} = 84 \\text{ RFU}$. While this is not a standard definition, it is a formal construction based entirely on the quantities provided ($S_{\\min}$ and $Q_{1-\\alpha}(N)$). The other options (B, C, D) introduce arbitrary multipliers or use incorrect statistical parameters, making their definitions for $T_a$ ad-hoc or incorrect.\n\n### Stochastic Threshold ($T_s$) Derivation\n\nThe stochastic threshold, $T_s$, is the minimum peak height for a major allele ($H_{\\max}$) of a heterozygote pair, above which the minor allele ($H_{\\min}$) is expected to be detected above the analytical threshold ($T_a$) with a controlled dropout risk of $\\beta = 0.05$.\n\nAllelic dropout of a minor allele occurs if $H_{\\min} < T_a$.\nThe relationship between the heterozygous peak heights is given by the ratio $R = H_{\\min} / H_{\\max}$. Thus, $H_{\\min} = H_{\\max} \\cdot R$.\nThe dropout condition can be written as $H_{\\max} \\cdot R < T_a$.\n\nWe want to find a threshold $T_s$ for $H_{\\max}$ such that if $H_{\\max} > T_s$, the probability of dropout is acceptably low. We set the limit at $H_{\\max} = T_s$, requiring the dropout probability to be no more than $\\beta$.\n$$P(H_{\\min} < T_a \\mid H_{\\max} = T_s) \\le \\beta$$\nSubstituting the expression for $H_{\\min}$:\n$$P(T_s \\cdot R < T_a) \\le \\beta$$\n$$P(R < T_a / T_s) \\le \\beta$$\nFrom the provided empirical data, we know the distribution of $R$. The $\\beta$-quantile of $R$, denoted $Q_{\\beta}(R)$, is the value for which $P(R < Q_{\\beta}(R)) = \\beta$.\nTo satisfy the inequality $P(R < T_a / T_s) \\le \\beta$, we must ensure that the argument $T_a / T_s$ is less than or equal to $Q_{\\beta}(R)$:\n$$T_a / T_s \\le Q_{\\beta}(R)$$\nTo find the minimum value of $T_s$ that guarantees this, we solve the equality:\n$$T_a / T_s = Q_{\\beta}(R)$$\nRearranging for $T_s$:\n$$T_s = \\frac{T_a}{Q_{\\beta}(R)}$$\nWith the specified dropout tolerance $\\beta = 0.05$, we must use the $5\\%$ quantile of the ratio $R$. The problem states that the empirical $5\\%$ quantile of $R$ is $Q_{0.05}(R) = 0.45$.\nThus, the correct formula for the stochastic threshold is $T_s = T_a / 0.45$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Define the analytical threshold $T_a$ as $T_a = S_{\\min} \\cdot Q_{1-\\alpha}(N)$, where $Q_{1-\\alpha}(N)$ is the $(1-\\alpha)$ quantile of baseline noise.

Define the stochastic threshold $T_s$ by requiring $H_{\\max} \\cdot Q_{\\beta}(R) \\ge T_a$ with probability at least $1-\\beta$, so $T_s = T_a / Q_{\\beta}(R)$.

The calculation $T_a = 3 \\times 28 = 84$ RFU is correct.\n*   **$T_s$ justification**: The reasoning \"requiring $H_{\\max} \\cdot Q_{\\beta}(R) \\ge T_a$\" leads to $T_s = T_a / Q_{\\beta}(R)$, which is fully consistent with our rigorous derivation.\n*   **$T_s$ calculation**: Using $T_a=84$ RFU and the correct quantile $Q_{0.05}(R) = 0.45$ (for $\\beta=0.05$), the calculation $T_s = 84 / 0.45 \\approx 186.67$, which is correctly rounded to $187$ RFU.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.

Define the stochastic threshold $T_s$ as $T_s = 2 \\cdot T_a = 48$ RFU, on the reasoning that doubling the analytical threshold suffices to avoid dropout.**\n*   **$T_a$ justification**: This uses the median noise ($8$ RFU) as a proxy for the mean. The resulting threshold $T_a \\approx 24$ RFU is less than the $99.9\\%$ quantile of noise ($28$ RFU), meaning it fails to meet the false positive rate target of $\\alpha = 10^{-3}$.\n*   **$T_s$ justification**: The definition $T_s = 2 \\cdot T_a$ is an arbitrary rule of thumb and is not derived from the specified dropout tolerance $\\beta$ and heterozygote balance distribution $R$.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Define the analytical threshold $T_a$ as $T_a = 2 \\cdot Q_{0.95}(N)$, where $Q_{0.95}(N)$ is the $95\\%$ quantile of noise, yielding $T_a = 2 \\times 18 = 36$ RFU, and set the SNR requirement implicitly satisfied by the doubling. Define the stochastic threshold $T_s$ using the median heterozygote ratio $R_{\\text{med}} = 0.80$ as $T_s = T_a / R_{\\text{med}} = 36 / 0.80 = 45$ RFU.**\n*   **$T_a$ justification**: Using a multiplier of $2$ is arbitrary. Using the $95\\%$ quantile ($Q_{0.95}(N)$) is inconsistent with the specified false positive target $\\alpha = 10^{-3}$, which points to the $99.9\\%$ quantile.\n*   **$T_s$ justification**: Using the median ratio $R_{\\text{med}}$ corresponds to a dropout tolerance of $50\\%$ ($\\beta = 0.50$), not the required $\\beta = 0.05$.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.

It accurately frames a complex but realistic scenario in forensic diagnostics, providing sufficient and consistent information to evaluate the proposed solutions.\n\n**Solution Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\nA robust set of criteria for interpreting heterozygote balance must account for three key phenomena described in the problem:\n1.  **Stochastic Imbalance**: The inherent randomness of PCR amplification from a small number of template molecules ($n$) predicts greater peak height imbalance for low-signal profiles. Therefore, any threshold for imbalance should be dynamic, becoming more tolerant (e.g., allowing a lower Peak Height Ratio) as the total signal ($H_A + H_B$), and thus $n$, decreases.\n2.  **Stutter Artifacts**: A true minor allele peak must be reliably distinguished from the stutter artifact of the major allele. This requires that the minor allele's peak height ($H_{\\min}$) be significantly greater than the expected stutter peak height ($s \\, H_{\\max}$).\n3.  **Analytical Threshold**: Any reported peak must exceed the laboratory's analytical threshold ($T_a$), which is set to distinguish signal from background instrument noise. Allelic dropout is the failure of an allele to produce a peak that meets these criteria for detection.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option against these principles.\n\n**Option A Analysis:** This option defines heterozygote balance as $HB = \\dfrac{H_A - H_B}{H_A + H_B}$ and uses a fixed threshold $\\lvert HB \\rvert \\leq 0.2$. A fixed threshold is fundamentally inconsistent with the principle that stochastic imbalance is dependent on the total number of template molecules ($n$). This rule would be overly stringent for low-template samples and potentially too lenient for high-template samples. Furthermore, it states to \"not incorporate stutter in the decision because baseline noise already covers artifacts.\" This is a critical scientific error. Baseline noise and stutter are distinct phenomena; noise is generally signal-independent, while stutter is signal-dependent. Ignoring stutter is a major flaw in STR profile interpretation. Therefore, this option is inconsistent with the provided principles.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**Option B Analysis:** This option defines the Peak Height Ratio (PHR) as $\\mathrm{PHR} = \\dfrac{\\min(H_A, H_B)}{\\max(H_A, H_B)}$. It correctly proposes using a **dynamic imbalance threshold**, $r_{95}(n)$, which is derived from the binomial sampling model and is dependent on the estimated molecule count $n$. This directly and correctly addresses the issue of stochastic imbalance. It proposes to flag preferential amplification if the PHR falls below this dynamic threshold, but only if the minor peak is unambiguously a true allele. The criteria for an unambiguous minor allele are $H_{\\min} \\geq T_a$ (above analytical threshold) and $H_{\\min} \\geq s \\, H_{\\max} + 3 \\, \\sigma_n$. This second condition is a statistically robust method for ensuring the minor peak is not a stutter artifact, as it must exceed the expected stutter height by a margin of $3$ standard deviations of the noise. Finally, it flags potential dropout if the minor peak fails to meet a composite threshold, $H_{\\min} < \\max\\!\\big(T_a, s \\, H_{\\max}\\big) + 3 \\, \\sigma_n$, which correctly combines the requirements of clearing both the analytical threshold and the stutter-plus-noise threshold. This entire framework is internally consistent and correctly formalizes all the key principles laid out in the problem statement. The qualitative summary accurately reflects this sophisticated approach.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Option C Analysis:** This option uses the standard PHR metric but applies a **fixed cutoff** of $\\mathrm{PHR} \\geq 0.8$. Like option A, this fails to account for the signal-dependent nature of stochastic imbalance. It also contains internally inconsistent logic for flagging dropout: the rule applies only when $(H_A + H_B) > 500$ RFU, ignoring the low-signal regime where dropout is most probable. The claim that \"stutter need not be considered separately because the $2:1$ rule is conservative\" is false. For a major peak of $H_{\\max} = 1000$ RFU, the stutter would be around $100$ RFU. A minor allele at $H_{\\min} = 120$ RFU would be a real peak distinguishable from stutter, but the profile would be flagged as dropout under a simple $2:1$ rule ($\\mathrm{PHR} = 0.12 < 0.5$) when it is not. This option's rules are simplistic and scientifically unsound.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**Option D Analysis:** This option introduces a non-standard metric, $\\mathrm{SCB} = \\dfrac{H_{\\min} - s \\, H_{\\max}}{H_{\\max}}$, which simplifies to $\\mathrm{PHR} - s$. It then requires $\\mathrm{SCB} \\geq 0.8$, which, with $s=0.10$, is equivalent to $\\mathrm{PHR} \\geq 0.9$. This is an extremely stringent, **fixed threshold** that is inappropriate for the reasons already discussed. While its rule for distinguishing an allele from stutter ($H_{\\min} < 2 \\, s \\, H_{\\max}$) is a plausible heuristic, the overall framework is built upon an flawed metric and a fixed balance criterion that ignores the fundamental role of stochastic variation at different template levels.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5161305"}]}
