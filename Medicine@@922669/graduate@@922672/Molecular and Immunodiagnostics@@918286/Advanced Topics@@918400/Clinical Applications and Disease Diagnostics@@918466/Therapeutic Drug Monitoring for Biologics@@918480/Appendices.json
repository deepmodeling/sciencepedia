Doses of magnitude $\\mathrm{Dose}$ are administered at a fixed dosing interval $\\tau$. Assume steady state has been reached and ignore any nonlinear elimination or target-mediated drug disposition.\n\nStarting from fundamental linear pharmacokinetic principles (first-order elimination with superposition of dose contributions), derive the analytic expression for the steady-state trough concentration $C_{\\text{trough}}$ immediately prior to the next dose, as a function of $\\mathrm{Dose}$, $\\mathrm{CL}$, $V$, and $\\tau$.

It is based on the fundamental principles of linear pharmacokinetics.\n\nWe are tasked with deriving the expression for the steady-state trough concentration, $C_{\\text{trough}}$, for a drug administered via intravenous (IV) bolus doses in a one-compartment model with first-order elimination.\n\nFirst, consider the concentration of the drug in the body following a single IV bolus dose. The concentration, $C(t)$, at a time $t$ after the dose is given by the equation for first-order exponential decay:\n$$C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt)$$\nwhere $C_0$ is the initial concentration at $t=0$, and $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. The initial concentration is the dose administered, $\\mathrm{Dose}$, divided by the volume of distribution, $V$:\n$$C_0 = \\frac{\\mathrm{Dose}}{V}$$\nThus, for a single dose:\n$$C(t) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Dose}}{V} \\exp(-kt)$$\n\nFor a multiple-dosing regimen where a dose is administered every $\\tau$ time units, the principle of superposition applies due to the linearity of the system. The total concentration at any time is the sum of the concentrations remaining from all previous doses.\n\nAt steady state, the concentration profile is periodic. Let $C_{\\text{ss,trough}}$ be the trough concentration immediately before a dose is administered, and let $C_{\\text{ss,peak}}$ be the peak concentration immediately after the dose. The relationship between the peak and trough within one dosing interval $\\tau$ is one of simple decay:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,trough}} = C_{\\text{ss,peak}} \\exp(-k\\tau)$$\nThe peak concentration at steady state is the sum of the preceding trough concentration and the instantaneous increase in concentration from the new dose:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,peak}} = C_{\\text{ss,trough}} + \\frac{\\mathrm{Dose}}{V}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{\\text{ss,peak}}$ into the decay equation gives:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,trough}} = \\left( C_{\\text{ss,trough}} + \\frac{\\mathrm{Dose}}{V} \\right) \\exp(-k\\tau)$$\nWe can now solve for $C_{\\text{ss,trough}}$, which the problem denotes as $C_{\\text{trough}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{trough}} = C_{\\text{trough}} \\exp(-k\\tau) + \\frac{\\mathrm{Dose}}{V} \\exp(-k\\tau)$$\n$$C_{\\text{trough}} - C_{\\text{trough}} \\exp(-k\\tau) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Dose}}{V} \\exp(-k\\tau)$$\n$$C_{\\text{trough}} (1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Dose}}{V} \\exp(-k\\tau)$$\n$$C_{\\text{trough}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Dose}}{V} \\frac{\\exp(-k\\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)}$$\nThis expression can be algebraically manipulated for computational convenience by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(k\\tau)$:\n$$C_{\\text{trough}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Dose}}{V} \\frac{1}{\\exp(k\\tau) - 1}$$\nThe problem requires the expression as a function of $\\mathrm{Dose}$, $\\mathrm{CL}$, $V$, and $\\tau$. We substitute the definition of the elimination rate constant, $k = \\mathrm{CL}/V$:\n$$C_{\\text{trough}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Dose}}{V} \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{CL}}{V}\\tau\\right) - 1}$$\nThis is the required analytical expression for the steady-state trough concentration.\n\nThe problem also asks for an interpretation of how $C_{\\text{trough}}$ depends on $\\mathrm{CL}$ and $V$.\n1.  Dependence on Clearance ($\\mathrm{CL}$): The clearance, $\\mathrm{CL}$, appears in the exponent in the denominator. As $\\mathrm{CL}$ increases, the argument of the exponential function, $(\\mathrm{CL}/V)\\tau$, increases. This causes the value of the exponential term, $\\exp((\\mathrm{CL}/V)\\tau)$, to increase, which in turn increases the denominator. A larger denominator leads to a smaller value for the overall fraction. Therefore, $C_{\\text{trough}}$ is inversely related to $\\mathrm{CL}$. This is physiologically consistent, as higher clearance implies more rapid drug elimination from the body, resulting in lower drug concentrations at any given time, including the trough.\n\n2.  Dependence on Volume of Distribution ($V$): The volume of distribution, $V$, appears in both the pre-factor ($1/V$) and the exponent ($1/V$). An increase in $V$ decreases the pre-factor, which tends to decrease $C_{\\text{trough}}$. However, an increase in $V$ also decreases the magnitude of the exponent, which decreases the denominator and thus tends to increase $C_{\\text{trough}}$. To resolve these opposing effects, we analyze the function. Let $x = (\\mathrm{CL}/V)\\tau$. Then $C_{\\text{trough}}(x) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Dose}}{\\mathrm{CL}\\tau} \\frac{x}{\\exp(x) - 1}$. The derivative of $g(x) = x/(\\exp(x) - 1)$ with respect to $x$ is negative for $x > 0$. Since an increase in $V$ leads to a decrease in $x$, and $g(x)$ is a decreasing function of $x$, it follows that $C_{\\text{trough}}$ increases as $V$ increases (for a fixed $\\mathrm{CL}$). This is because a larger $V$ reduces the elimination rate constant $k = \\mathrm{CL}/V$ more significantly than it dilutes the initial concentration. The slower elimination rate allows for more drug accumulation, leading to a higher steady-state trough level.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $C_{\\text{trough}}$ using the given parameters:\n$\\mathrm{Dose} = 50$ mg\n$V = 5$ L\n$\\mathrm{CL} = 0.25$ L/day\n$\\tau = 14$ days\n\nFirst, we check that the units are consistent. The units for $\\mathrm{CL}$ and $\\tau$ are L/day and days, respectively, which is appropriate. The resulting concentration will be in mg/L.\n\nNext, we calculate the elimination rate constant, $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{\\mathrm{CL}}{V} = \\frac{0.25 \\, \\mathrm{L/day}}{5 \\, \\mathrm{L}} = 0.05 \\, \\mathrm{day}^{-1}$$\nThen, we compute the dimensionless product $k\\tau$:\n$$k\\tau = (0.05 \\, \\mathrm{day}^{-1}) \\times (14 \\, \\mathrm{days}) = 0.7$$\nNow we can substitute these values into the derived formula for $C_{\\text{trough}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{trough}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Dose}}{V} \\frac{1}{\\exp(k\\tau) - 1} = \\frac{50 \\, \\mathrm{mg}}{5 \\, \\mathrm{L}} \\frac{1}{\\exp(0.7) - 1}$$\n$$C_{\\text{trough}} = 10 \\, \\mathrm{mg/L} \\times \\frac{1}{\\exp(0.7) - 1}$$\nUsing a calculator for the exponential term:\n$$\\exp(0.7) \\approx 2.0137527$$\n$$C_{\\text{trough}} \\approx 10 \\, \\mathrm{mg/L} \\times \\frac{1}{2.0137527 - 1} = 10 \\, \\mathrm{mg/L} \\times \\frac{1}{1.0137527}$$\n$$C_{\\text{trough}} \\approx 9.864345 \\, \\mathrm{mg/L}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$C_{\\text{trough}} \\approx 9.864 \\, \\mathrm{mg/L}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.864}$$", "id": "5168198"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical framework of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics is only as useful as the data fed into it.
