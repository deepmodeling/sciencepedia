In limiting dilution, target molecules are randomly and independently distributed across partitions. Consider a dPCR assay designed to detect a rare point mutation in a background of wild-type DNA. You observe a fraction of partitions that are negative for the mutation target, denoted by $f_0$.

The problem statement is scientifically valid and well-posed, providing a standard model for quantitative analysis in digital PCR based on Poisson statistics.\n\nFirst, we will derive the expression for $\\lambda$ in terms of the fraction of negative partitions, $f_0$.\nLet $k$ be the random variable representing the number of target molecules within a single partition. According to the problem statement, the distribution of these molecules is governed by a Poisson process. The probability of finding exactly $k$ molecules in a partition is given by the Poisson probability mass function (PMF):\n$$P(k; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the mean number of molecules per partition, and $k$ can take non-negative integer values ($k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$).\n\nA partition is observed as \"negative\" if and only if it contains zero target molecules. This corresponds to the case where $k=0$. The theoretical probability of a partition being negative is therefore $P(k=0; \\lambda)$. We can calculate this probability from the PMF:\n$$P(k=0; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!}$$\nUsing the standard mathematical definitions that $\\lambda^0 = 1$ for any $\\lambda$ and $0! = 1$, we get:\n$$P(k=0; \\lambda) = \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nThe problem provides $f_0$ as the observed fraction of negative partitions from the experiment. For a large number of partitions $n$, the law of large numbers states that this experimentally observed fraction is a robust estimator for the true probability $P(k=0; \\lambda)$. We can therefore set:\n$$f_0 \\approx P(k=0; \\lambda)$$\nThis gives the equation:\n$$f_0 = \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nTo solve for $\\lambda$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$\\ln(f_0) = \\ln(\\exp(-\\lambda))$$\n$$\\ln(f_0) = -\\lambda$$\nThis yields the expression for the mean occupancy $\\lambda$ in terms of the negative fraction $f_0$:\n$$\\lambda = -\\ln(f_0)$$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation.\n\nNext, we are asked to estimate the absolute number of mutant target copies, which we will denote as $N_{total}$, present in the entire partitioned reaction volume. This volume contains $n$ partitions.\nThe parameter $\\lambda$ represents the average (or expected) number of target copies per partition. Since there are $n$ independent and identically distributed partitions, the total expected number of copies is the sum of the expected values for each partition. The best estimate for the total number of copies is thus the product of the number of partitions and the average number of copies per partition:\n$$N_{total} = n \\times \\lambda$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$N_{total} = -n \\ln(f_0)$$\nThe partition volume $v$ is part of the experimental description and necessary for calculating concentration (copies per unit volume), but it is not required for calculating the absolute number of copies, which is the quantity requested.\n\nFinally, we must compute the numerical value for $N_{total}$ using the provided data:\nNumber of accepted partitions, $n = 19600$.\nObserved negative fraction, $f_0 = 0.9985$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $N_{total}$:\n$$N_{total} = -19600 \\times \\ln(0.9985)$$\nUsing a calculator, we find the value of the natural logarithm:\n$$\\ln(0.9985) \\approx -0.00150112594$$\nNow, we calculate $N_{total}$:\n$$N_{total} \\approx -19600 \\times (-0.00150112594)$$\n$$N_{total} \\approx 29.4220684$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to three significant figures.

This mean is calculated using the estimated rate $\\hat{r}_b$:\n$$\\mu_b = M_s \\hat{r}_b$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\\mu_b = 20000 \\times (4 \\times 10^{-5}) = 0.8$$\nSo, under the null hypothesis, $X \\sim \\text{Pois}(0.8)$.\n\nStep 3: Derivation and Calculation of the p-value\n\nThe $p$-value is the probability of observing a result at least as extreme as the one actually observed ($x_s = 6$), assuming the null hypothesis is true. For a Poisson distribution, a more extreme result corresponds to a higher count. Thus, the $p$-value is $\\mathsf{p} = \\mathbb{P}(X \\geq x_s)$.\n$$\\mathsf{p} = \\mathbb{P}(X \\geq 6 \\mid \\mu_b = 0.8)$$\nThis probability is calculated as an infinite sum:\n$$\\mathsf{p} = \\sum_{k=x_s}^{\\infty} \\mathbb{P}(X=k) = \\sum_{k=6}^{\\infty} \\frac{e^{-\\mu_b} \\mu_b^k}{k!}$$\nComputationally, it is more efficient to calculate this using the complement, which is the cumulative probability of observing fewer than $x_s$ events:\n$$\\mathsf{p} = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(X < 6) = 1 - \\sum_{k=0}^{5} \\mathbb{P}(X=k) = 1 - \\sum_{k=0}^{5} \\frac{e^{-\\mu_b} \\mu_b^k}{k!}$$\nSubstituting the value of $\\mu_b = 0.8$:\n$$\\mathsf{p} = 1 - e^{-0.8} \\left( \\frac{0.8^0}{0!} + \\frac{0.8^1}{1!} + \\frac{0.8^2}{2!} + \\frac{0.8^3}{3!} + \\frac{0.8^4}{4!} + \\frac{0.8^5}{5!} \\right)$$\nLet's evaluate the terms in the summation:\n\\begin{align*} \\sum_{k=0}^{5} \\frac{0.8^k}{k!} &= 1 + 0.8 + \\frac{0.64}{2} + \\frac{0.512}{6} + \\frac{0.4096}{24} + \\frac{0.32768}{120} \\\\ &= 1 + 0.8 + 0.32 + 0.085333... + 0.017066... + 0.002730... \\\\ &\\approx 2.22513067 \\end{align*}\nThe value of $e^{-0.8}$ is approximately $0.44932896$.\nThe cumulative probability is:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(X < 6) = e^{-0.8} \\sum_{k=0}^{5} \\frac{0.8^k}{k!} \\approx 0.44932896 \\times 2.22513067 \\approx 0.99981566$$\nFinally, the $p$-value is:\n$$\\mathsf{p} = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(X < 6) \\approx 1 - 0.99981566 = 0.00018434$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get $0.0001843$.\n\nComparing this $p$-value to the given significance threshold $\\alpha = 0.05$, we find that $\\mathsf{p} \\approx 0.0001843 < 0.05$. Therefore, we would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the observation of $x_s=6$ positive partitions is statistically significant, providing strong evidence for the presence of true mutant DNA in the sample. The final answer is the numerical value of the $p$-value.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0001843}$$", "id": "5106118"}]}
