The derivation will be based sequentially on the principles and process steps provided.\n\n1.  **Initial number of target molecules**: The initial sample has a volume $V$ and a target concentration of $c_0$. Based on the principle that the expected number of molecules is the product of concentration and volume, the initial number of target molecules, $N_0$, is:\n    $$N_0 = c_0 V$$\n\n2.  **Molecules recovered after extraction**: The extraction process has an overall efficiency $\\eta$, which is the fraction of input molecules recovered.

First, a first-order loss process with rate constant $k$ over time $t$ results in a survival fraction of $\\exp(-kt)$. Second, a volumetric retention fraction $r$ means that a fraction $(1-r)$ of the liquid and the molecules suspended within it successfully reaches the reaction.

Consider a minimal, well-mixed system with the following species: inactive effector $E$, target $T$, active effector–target complex $A$, uncleaved reporter $R$, and cleaved reporter $P$. Activation occurs by reversible binding $E + T \\rightleftharpoons A$ governed by the law of mass action with association and dissociation rate constants $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, respectively. While active, $A$ catalyzes reporter cleavage following Michaelis–Menten kinetics with catalytic constant $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ and Michaelis constant $K_M$.

This is assumed to be in rapid pre-equilibrium, characterized by the dissociation constant $K_d = k_{\\text{off}}/k_{\\text{on}}$.\n$2.$ Trans-cleavage of reporter: The active complex $A$ catalytically cleaves $R$ into $P$.

Under the assumption that the reporter concentration $[R]$ is approximately constant at its initial value $R_0$ on the timescale of a single target's lifetime, this rate becomes a constant:\n$$\nv_{\\text{cat}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}R_0}{K_M + R_0}\n$$\nThis quantity, $v_{\\text{cat}}$, has units of $\\text{s}^{-1}$ and represents the number of reporter molecules cleaved per second by a single active complex $A$.\n\nThe cis-cleavage process, $A \\xrightarrow{k_{\\text{cis}}} \\dots$, is a first-order decay of the active complex with rate constant $k_{\\text{cis}}$. This means that cis-cleavage is a random event with a constant probability per unit time. The average lifetime of the complex $A$ before it undergoes cis-cleavage is $\\tau_A = 1/k_{\\text{cis}}$.\n\nThe problem states that the binding and unbinding of the target are fast compared to catalysis and cis-cleavage. This establishes a rapid pre-equilibrium. A single target molecule switches rapidly between the free state $T$ and the bound, active state $A$. Both trans-cleavage of reporter and cis-cleavage of the target can *only* occur when the target is in the active state $A$. The time spent in the free state $T$ effectively pauses the \"clocks\" for both catalytic processes.\n\nThe total number of reporter molecules cleaved per target is the product of the rate of cleavage (when active) and the total time the target spends in the active state before being destroyed. The total integrated time a target must spend in the active state $A$ for the cis-cleavage event to occur is, on average, exactly $\\tau_{\\text{active}} = 1/k_{\\text{cis}}$. While the rapid unbinding and rebinding ($E+T \\rightleftharpoons A$) affects the overall real time it takes for this to happen, it does not change the total *active* time.\n\nTherefore, the expected total number of reporter molecules cleaved per target, $N_{\\text{cleaved}}$, is the product of the cleavage rate per active complex and the total active lifetime:\n$$\nN_{\\text{cleaved}} = v_{\\text{cat}} \\times \\tau_{\\text{active}} = \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}R_0}{K_M + R_0} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{cis}}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\text{cleaved}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}R_0}{k_{\\text{cis}}(K_M + R_0)}\n$$\nThe dissociation constant $K_d$ does not appear in this expression. The reason for its absence is that the rapid pre-equilibrium assumption means that the competition between trans-cleavage and cis-cleavage occurs only during the periods when the complex is in state $A$. The fraction of time the target spends in the active state, $p_A$, depends on $K_d$ and the effector concentration $[E]$. The average rate of trans-cleavage for a target molecule is $p_A v_{\\text{cat}}$, and the average rate of its destruction is $p_A k_{\\text{cis}}$. The total number of events is the ratio of these rates, $\\frac{p_A v_{\\text{cat}}}{p_A k_{\\text{cis}}} = \\frac{v_{\\text{cat}}}{k_{\\text{cis}}}$. The factor $p_A$ cancels, rendering the final yield independent of the binding equilibrium ($K_d$) and effector concentration.\n\n**2) Asymptotic plateau concentration $P_{\\infty}$**\n\nIn a closed batch reaction with initial target concentration $T_0$ and initial reporter concentration $R_0$, the reaction proceeds until a limiting reagent is consumed.\nThe two possibilities for reaction termination are:\na) **Target depletion**: All target molecules are eventually destroyed by cis-cleavage.\nb) **Reporter depletion**: All reporter molecules are cleaved into product $P$.\n\nIf the reaction is target-limited, the total concentration of cleaved reporter will be the number of cleavage events per target ($N_{\\text{cleaved}}$) multiplied by the initial target concentration ($T_0$):\n$$\n[P]_{\\text{T-limited}} = N_{\\text{cleaved}} \\times T_0 = \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}R_0}{k_{\\text{cis}}(K_M + R_0)} \\right) T_0\n$$\nIf the reaction is reporter-limited, the total concentration of cleaved reporter will simply be the initial reporter concentration, as all of it is converted to product:\n$$\n[P]_{\\text{R-limited}} = R_0\n$$\nThe actual asymptotic plateau concentration, $P_{\\infty}$, will be the lesser of these two values, as the reaction stops at the first limit it reaches:\n$$\nP_{\\infty} = \\min \\left( R_0, \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}R_0}{k_{\\text{cis}}(K_M + R_0)} \\right) T_0 \\right)\n$$\nReporter depletion, rather than target depletion, determines the plateau when the potentially generatable product concentration exceeds the available reporter.
