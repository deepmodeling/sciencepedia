It is therefore deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe first task is to find the general solution for the amplicon copy number $N(t)$ by solving the given differential equation. The equation is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients, which can be solved by separation of variables.\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = k\\,N $$\nSeparating the variables $N$ and $t$, we obtain:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{N} = k\\,dt $$\nNext, we integrate both sides of the equation. We integrate the left side from the initial copy number $N_0$ at time $t=0$ to the copy number $N(t)$ at a general time $t$. The right side is integrated from $t'=0$ to $t'=t$.\n$$ \\int_{N_0}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N'} dN' = \\int_{0}^{t} k\\,dt' $$\nEvaluating the definite integrals yields:\n$$ \\left[ \\ln|N'| \\right]_{N_0}^{N(t)} = \\left[ k\\,t' \\right]_{0}^{t} $$\nSince the number of molecules $N$ is always positive, the absolute value is redundant.\n$$ \\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N_0) = k\\,t - 0 $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = k\\,t $$\nTo solve for $N(t)$, we exponentiate both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\frac{N(t)}{N_0} = \\exp(k\\,t) $$\n$$ N(t) = N_0 \\exp(k\\,t) $$\nThis equation describes the exponential growth of the amplicon copy number over time.\n\nThe second task is to derive an expression for the detection time $t^{*}$. By definition, $t^{*}$ is the time at which the copy number $N(t)$ reaches the threshold value $N_{\\text{th}}$. We set $t = t^{*}$ and $N(t^{*}) = N_{\\text{th}}$ in the solution we just derived:\n$$ N_{\\text{th}} = N_0 \\exp(k\\,t^{*}) $$\nTo solve for $t^{*}$, we first isolate the exponential term by dividing by $N_0$:\n$$ \\frac{N_{\\text{th}}}{N_0} = \\exp(k\\,t^{*}) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{\\text{th}}}{N_0}\\right) = k\\,t^{*} $$\nFinally, we solve for $t^{*}$ by dividing by the rate constant $k$:\n$$ t^{*} = \\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{\\text{th}}}{N_0}\\right) $$\nThis is the required analytic expression for $t^{*}$ in terms of $k$, $N_{\\text{th}}$, and $N_0$.\n\nThe third task is to evaluate $t^{*}$ using the provided numerical values: $N_0 = 10$, $N_{\\text{th}} = 10^{9}$, and $k = 0.35\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$.\nWe substitute these values into the derived expression for $t^{*}$:\n$$ t^{*} = \\frac{1}{0.35\\,\\text{min}^{-1}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{10^{9}}{10}\\right) $$\nFirst, we compute the ratio inside the logarithm:\n$$ \\frac{N_{\\text{th}}}{N_0} = \\frac{10^{9}}{10} = 10^8 $$\nNow, the expression for $t^{*}$ becomes:\n$$ t^{*} = \\frac{1}{0.35} \\ln(10^8) $$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$, we can simplify this to:\n$$ t^{*} = \\frac{8 \\ln(10)}{0.35} $$\nThe value of $\\ln(10)$ is approximately $2.302585$.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires us to derive the relative probability of polymerase extension for a primer with a $3^{\\prime}$-terminal mismatch compared to a perfectly matched primer. The system is described by a two-state model at thermal equilibrium. Let the two states be an extension-incompetent state, $I$, and an extension-competent state, $C$. The free energies of these states are $G_I$ and $G_C$, respectively.\n\nAccording to the principles of statistical mechanics, the probability of the system occupying any given state is determined by its Boltzmann factor. For a two-state system, the probability of being in the competent state, $P_C$, is given by:\n$$ P_C = \\frac{\\exp(-G_C / RT)}{\\exp(-G_I / RT) + \\exp(-G_C / RT)} $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. This expression can be rewritten in terms of the free energy difference, $\\Delta G = G_C - G_I$:\n$$ P_C = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(\\Delta G / RT)} $$\nThe problem states that polymerase extension proceeds only from the competent state $C$. Therefore, the per-encounter extension probability, $p_{ext}$, is directly proportional to the equilibrium occupancy of this state:\n$$ p_{ext} \\propto P_C $$\nTo solve the problem, we must make a key assumption that is physically well-justified. The extension-competent state, where the $3^{\\prime}$ end of the primer is perfectly annealed and docked in the polymerase active site, represents a highly ordered, specific conformation. In contrast, the incompetent state represents a broad ensemble of conformations where the $3^{\\prime}$ end is frayed or otherwise misaligned. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the competent state is a high-energy, low-probability state relative to the incompetent state. Mathematically, this assumption is expressed as $G_C \\gg G_I$, which implies $\\Delta G \\gg RT$ and thus $\\exp(\\Delta G / RT) \\gg 1$.\n\nUnder this assumption, the denominator in the expression for $P_C$ can be simplified:\n$$ 1 + \\exp(\\Delta G / RT) \\approx \\exp(\\Delta G / RT) $$\nThus, the probability of the competent state is well-approximated by:\n$$ P_C \\approx \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\Delta G / RT)} = \\exp(-\\Delta G / RT) = \\exp(-(G_C - G_I)/RT) $$\nNow, we apply this to the two cases: the perfectly matched (pm) primer and the mismatched (mm) primer.\n\nFor the perfectly matched case:\n$$ p_{ext,pm} \\propto P_{C,pm} \\approx \\exp(-(G_{C,pm} - G_{I,pm})/RT) $$\nFor the mismatched case, the problem states that the free energy of the competent state is raised by $\\Delta \\Delta G$. We assume the free energy of the disorganized, incompetent state is unaffected by the single mismatch. Therefore:\n$$ G_{C,mm} = G_{C,pm} + \\Delta \\Delta G $$\n$$ G_{I,mm} = G_{I,pm} $$\nThe free energy difference for the mismatched case is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{mm} = G_{C,mm} - G_{I,mm} = (G_{C,pm} + \\Delta \\Delta G) - G_{I,pm} = (G_{C,pm} - G_{I,pm}) + \\Delta \\Delta G $$\nThe extension probability for the mismatched case is then:\n$$ p_{ext,mm} \\propto P_{C,mm} \\approx \\exp(-((G_{C,pm} - G_{I,pm}) + \\Delta \\Delta G)/RT) $$\nThe relative per-encounter extension probability (mismatch versus perfect match) is the ratio of their respective probabilities:\n$$ \\frac{p_{ext,mm}}{p_{ext,pm}} = \\frac{P_{C,mm}}{P_{C,pm}} \\approx \\frac{\\exp(-((G_{C,pm} - G_{I,pm}) + \\Delta \\Delta G)/RT)}{\\exp(-(G_{C,pm} - G_{I,pm})/RT)} $$\nThe term $\\exp(-(G_{C,pm} - G_{I,pm})/RT)$ cancels out, yielding the final expression for the relative probability:\n$$ \\frac{p_{ext,mm}}{p_{ext,pm}} \\approx \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta \\Delta G}{RT}\\right) $$\nWe now evaluate this expression numerically using the provided values. First, all quantities must be in consistent SI units. We convert $\\Delta \\Delta G$ from $\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ to $\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n$$ \\Delta \\Delta G = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{kcal}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\times 4184\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{kcal}^{-1} = 14644\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} $$\nNext, we compute the argument of the exponential function:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta \\Delta G}{RT} = \\frac{14644\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}}{(8.314\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1})(338\\,\\mathrm{K})} = \\frac{14644}{2810.132} \\approx 5.2111 $$\nThe relative extension probability is then:\n$$ \\frac{p_{ext,mm}}{p_{ext,pm}} \\approx \\exp(-5.2111) \\approx 0.005456 $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives $0.00546$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.00546}$$", "id": "5127219"}, {"introduction": "A successful diagnostic assay must perform reliably not just under ideal laboratory conditions, but also within the constraints of real-world instruments.
