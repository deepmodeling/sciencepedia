A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to model the detection of a genetic variant using a sequencing assay as a probabilistic process. Let $X$ be the random variable representing the number of reads that support the variant allele out of a total of $n$ independent reads. According to the problem statement, each read is an independent Bernoulli trial with a probability $p$ of observing the variant allele, where $p$ is the effective variant allele fraction in the bulk sample. Therefore, $X$ follows a binomial distribution:\n$$X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$$\nThe probability of success $p$ is given by $p = \\pi f_{t}$, where $\\pi$ is the tumor purity and $f_{t}$ is the variant allele fraction within the tumor cells.\n\nThe assay calls the variant if the observed variant allele fraction, $\\hat{p} = X/n$, meets or exceeds the detection threshold $\\tau$. This condition can be expressed in terms of the number of variant reads $X$:\n$$\\frac{X}{n} \\ge \\tau \\implies X \\ge n\\tau$$\nGiven $n=500$ and $\\tau=0.05$, the minimum number of variant reads required for a positive call is:\n$$k_{min} = n\\tau = 500 \\times 0.05 = 25$$\nSince $X$ must be an integer, the variant is called if $X \\ge 25$.\n\nSensitivity, $S(\\pi)$, is defined as the probability of the assay calling the variant. Thus, we can express sensitivity as the cumulative probability of observing at least $k_{min}$ variant reads:\n$$S(\\pi) = P(X \\ge 25)$$\nwhere the distribution of $X$ depends on $\\pi$ through the probability parameter $p = \\pi f_{t}$. We must now calculate this sensitivity for the two given tumor purities, $\\pi_1$ and $\\pi_2$.\n\n**Case 1: Tumor Purity $\\pi_{1} = 0.40$**\nFirst, we calculate the effective variant allele fraction, $p_1$:\n$$p_1 = \\pi_{1} f_{t} = 0.40 \\times 0.20 = 0.08$$\nThe number of variant reads, $X_1$, follows the distribution $X_1 \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n=500, p=0.08)$. The sensitivity at this purity is $S(\\pi_1) = P(X_1 \\ge 25)$.\n\nCalculating this sum directly from the binomial probability mass function is computationally intensive. Since $n$ is large, and the conditions $np_1 = 500 \\times 0.08 = 40 > 5$ and $n(1-p_1) = 500 \\times 0.92 = 460 > 5$ are met, we can use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution with high accuracy. We include a continuity correction for improved precision.\n\nThe mean and standard deviation of the approximating normal distribution are:\n$$\\mu_1 = np_1 = 40$$\n$$\\sigma_1 = \\sqrt{np_1(1-p_1)} = \\sqrt{500 \\times 0.08 \\times 0.92} = \\sqrt{36.8}$$\nThe probability $P(X_1 \\ge 25)$ is approximated by $P(Y \\ge 24.5)$, where $Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1, \\sigma_1^2)$. We standardize this to a standard normal variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$:\n$$Z_1 = \\frac{24.5 - \\mu_1}{\\sigma_1} = \\frac{24.5 - 40}{\\sqrt{36.8}} = \\frac{-15.5}{\\sqrt{36.8}} \\approx -2.55507$$\nThe sensitivity is then:\n$$S(\\pi_1) = P(Z > -2.55507) = 1 - P(Z \\le -2.55507) = P(Z \\le 2.55507) = \\Phi(2.55507)$$\nwhere $\\Phi(z)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. Using standard tables or a calculator, this value is approximately $0.99468$.\n\n**Case 2: Tumor Purity $\\pi_{2} = 0.10$**\nSimilarly, we calculate the effective variant allele fraction, $p_2$:\n$$p_2 = \\pi_{2} f_{t} = 0.10 \\times 0.20 = 0.02$$\nThe number of variant reads, $X_2$, follows the distribution $X_2 \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n=500, p=0.02)$. The sensitivity is $S(\\pi_2) = P(X_2 \\ge 25)$.\n\nWe again use the normal approximation. The conditions $np_2 = 500 \\times 0.02 = 10 > 5$ and $n(1-p_2) = 500 \\times 0.98 = 490 > 5$ are met. The parameters are:\n$$\\mu_2 = np_2 = 10$$\n$$\\sigma_2 = \\sqrt{np_2(1-p_2)} = \\sqrt{500 \\times 0.02 \\times 0.98} = \\sqrt{9.8}$$\nApplying the continuity correction, we calculate the Z-score:\n$$Z_2 = \\frac{24.5 - \\mu_2}{\\sigma_2} = \\frac{24.5 - 10}{\\sqrt{9.8}} = \\frac{14.5}{\\sqrt{9.8}} \\approx 4.63183$$\nThe sensitivity is:\n$$S(\\pi_2) = P(Z > 4.63183) = 1 - \\Phi(4.63183)$$\nThe value of $\\Phi(z)$ for $z=4.63183$ is extremely close to $1$. The probability in the upper tail is minuscule, approximately $1.797 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\n**Calculation of Sensitivity Loss, $L$**\nFinally, we compute the sensitivity loss $L$, defined as the absolute decrease in sensitivity:\n$$L = S(\\pi_1) - S(\\pi_2)$$\n$$L \\approx 0.99468 - (1.797 \\times 10^{-6}) = 0.99468 - 0.000001797 \\approx 0.994678$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$L \\approx 0.9947$$\nThis result quantifies the substantial drop in the assay's ability to detect the variant as tumor purity decreases from $40\\%$ to $10\\%$, falling from near-certainty to virtually zero.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9947}$$", "id": "5102547"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate purpose of a companion diagnostic is to guide therapy by identifying the specific patient population that will benefit from a targeted treatment.

The log-odds of response, or logit($p$), is given by a linear model including a treatment indicator $T$, a biomarker indicator $B$, and their interaction term. The general form of this model is:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 T + \\beta_2 B + \\beta_3 (T \\cdot B)\n$$\nHere, $T=1$ for patients receiving the therapy and $T=0$ for the control group.

The model simplifies to:\n$$\n\\ln(\\text{odds})|_{B=0} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 T\n$$\nThe log-odds for a treated patient ($T=1, B=0$) is $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1$.\nThe log-odds for a control patient ($T=0, B=0$) is $\\beta_0$.\nThe log-odds ratio for treatment in this stratum is the difference: $(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1) - \\beta_0 = \\beta_1$.\nThe odds ratio is therefore $OR_{-} = \\exp(\\beta_1)$.

This positive, non-zero interaction term signifies that the effect of the therapy is not uniform across the patient population but is dependent on the biomarker status. This is the statistical definition of a predictive biomarker.\n\nSpecifically, the treatment shows a substantial beneficial effect in the biomarker-positive population, increasing the odds of response by a factor of $3.0$. Conversely, in the biomarker-negative population, the treatment has no effect, as the odds ratio is $1.0$. This stark difference has profound implications for the co-approval strategy.\n\n**Implications for Drug Labeling and Indication Restriction:**\nBased on these findings, the drug's indication should be strictly restricted to the biomarker-positive patient population. The drug label, which is the legal document guiding clinical use, must explicitly state this. For example, the \"Indications and Usage\" section would specify that the drug is for the treatment of the particular cancer in patients who are biomarker-positive as determined by an approved companion diagnostic test.\n\nThis restriction is mandated by fundamental principles of medical ethics and benefit-risk assessment. Administering the drug to biomarker-negative patients would expose them to the drug's toxicity profile and financial costs without any prospect of clinical benefit. This would result in an unacceptable benefit-risk balance for this subgroup. Regulatory authorities like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) would require such a targeted indication to ensure patient safety and the appropriate use of the medicine. The data strongly support a co-approval pathway, where the drug and the specific CDx used in the trial are approved simultaneously, inextricably linking the therapy to the diagnostic test.\n\n**Additional Evidence Required for Regulatory Approval:**\nWhile the observed odds ratios of $3.0$ and $1.0$ provide a clear signal, regulatory approval requires a more comprehensive and robust body of evidence. Key additional requirements would include:\n\n$1$. **Statistical Rigor:** The point estimates of the odds ratios are insufficient. The submission must include the $95\\%$ confidence intervals (CIs) for $OR_{+}$ and $OR_{-}$. To be compelling, the CI for $OR_{+}$ must be entirely above $1.0$ (e.g., $[1.8, 4.9]$), demonstrating a statistically significant benefit. The CI for $OR_{-}$ should be narrow and centered around $1.0$ (e.g., $[0.8, 1.25]$), confirming the lack of effect. Furthermore, a formal statistical test of the interaction null hypothesis ($H_0: \\beta_3 = 0$) must be presented and should yield a statistically significant p-value. Ideally, the trial should have been prospectively designed and powered to detect such an interaction.\n\n$2$. **Analytical Validation of the Companion Diagnostic (CDx):** The diagnostic test used to classify patients as biomarker-positive or -negative must undergo rigorous analytical validation. This involves establishing the assay's performance characteristics, including its accuracy (e.g., versus a gold standard), precision (repeatability and reproducibility across different sites, operators, and reagent lots), analytical sensitivity and specificity, and the establishment of a well-defined and validated cutoff for determining positivity.\n\n$3$. **Clinical Validation and Utility:** The clinical trial itself serves to demonstrate the clinical validity of the biomarker, i.e., its ability to stratify patients based on their likelihood of response to the therapy. The trial design, often an \"all-comers\" design with biomarker stratification or an enrichment design, must be scientifically sound. The process for determining the biomarker cutoff value must be pre-specified and justified before the analysis to avoid an introduction of bias.\n\n$4$. **Consistency of Effect:** Regulators will scrutinize subgroup analyses to ensure the biomarker's predictive value is consistent across different demographic and clinical subgroups (e.g., age, gender, geographic region, disease stage). This confirms that the interaction is a robust biological phenomenon and not an artifact of a particular subgroup.\n\nIn summary, the observed data point strongly towards a classic case for a targeted therapy co-approved with a companion diagnostic. The indication would be restricted to biomarker-positive patients, a decision that must be supported by a comprehensive submission package that provides statistical, analytical, and clinical validation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.099}\n$$", "id": "5102570"}]}
