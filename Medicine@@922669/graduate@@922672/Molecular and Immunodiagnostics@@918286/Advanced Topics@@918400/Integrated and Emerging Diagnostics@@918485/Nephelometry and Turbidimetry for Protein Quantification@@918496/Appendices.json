A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires deriving an expression for the transmitted intensity $I$ and then calculating its value. This is approached by first determining the turbidity of the medium and then applying the law governing light attenuation.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for turbidity, $\\tau$, which in this context is equivalent to the scattering attenuation coefficient, $\\mu_s$. The attenuation coefficient is defined as the probability per unit path length that a photon is scattered out of the collimated beam. Consider a thin slab of the scattering medium with a cross-sectional area $A$ and an infinitesimal thickness $dx$. The volume of this slab is $dV = A \\cdot dx$.\n\nThe number of scattering particles within this volume is given by the product of the number concentration $N$ and the volume $dV$:\n$$ \\text{Number of scatterers} = N \\cdot dV = N \\cdot A \\cdot dx $$\n\nEach scatterer presents an elastic scattering cross-section $\\sigma_s$. Under the independent-scatterer approximation, the total scattering area presented by all particles in the slab is the number of scatterers multiplied by the cross-section of one scatterer:\n$$ \\text{Total scattering area} = (N \\cdot A \\cdot dx) \\cdot \\sigma_s $$\n\nThe probability that a photon traversing this slab is scattered is the ratio of the total scattering area to the total incident area $A$:\n$$ P(\\text{scatter in } dx) = \\frac{(N \\cdot A \\cdot dx) \\cdot \\sigma_s}{A} = N \\sigma_s dx $$\n\nThe probability of scattering per unit path length is this expression divided by the path length $dx$. This gives the scattering attenuation coefficient $\\mu_s$:\n$$ \\mu_s = \\frac{P(\\text{scatter in } dx)}{dx} = N \\sigma_s $$\n\nThe problem identifies turbidity $\\tau$ with this scattering coefficient. Therefore, the first part of the derivation is complete:\n$$ \\tau = N \\sigma_s $$\n\nNext, we use the basic form of the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) to find the transmitted intensity. For a collimated beam of intensity $I$ propagating along the direction $s$ in a medium that only scatters light out of the beam (no absorption, no emission, no in-scattering into the beam direction), the change in intensity $dI$ over a path length $ds$ is a loss proportional to the intensity itself and the scattering coefficient $\\mu_s$:\n$$ \\frac{dI}{ds} = -\\mu_s I $$\n\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables and integrating over the path length $l$ of the cuvette. The intensity decreases from $I_0$ at the entrance ($s=0$) to $I$ at the exit ($s=l$):\n$$ \\int_{I_0}^{I} \\frac{dI'}{I'} = -\\int_{0}^{l} \\mu_s ds' $$\n\nAssuming the medium is homogeneous, the scattering coefficient $\\mu_s$ (and thus the turbidity $\\tau$) is constant along the path. The integration yields:\n$$ \\ln(I) - \\ln(I_0) = -\\mu_s (l - 0) $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{I}{I_0}\\right) = -\\mu_s l $$\n\nExponentiating both sides gives the Beer-Lambert law for scattering:\n$$ \\frac{I}{I_0} = \\exp(-\\mu_s l) $$\n$$ I = I_0 \\exp(-\\mu_s l) $$\n\nSubstituting $\\tau = \\mu_s = N \\sigma_s$ into this equation, we obtain the final expression for the transmitted intensity in terms of the given microscopic parameters:\n$$ I = I_0 \\exp(-N \\sigma_s l) $$\n\nNow, we proceed with the numerical calculation using the provided values:\n- $N = 2.0 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n- $\\sigma_s = 5.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$\n- $l = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- $I_0 = 2.50\\,\\mathrm{mW}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the turbidity $\\tau$:\n$$ \\tau = N \\sigma_s = (2.0 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}) $$\n$$ \\tau = 10.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the dimensionless quantity in the exponent, which is the optical depth:\n$$ \\tau l = (1.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) \\times (1.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}) = 1.0 $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the transmitted intensity $I$:\n$$ I = I_0 \\exp(-1.0) = (2.50\\,\\mathrm{mW}) \\times \\exp(-1.0) $$\nUsing the value for Euler's number $e \\approx 2.71828...$, we find:\n$$ I \\approx \\frac{2.50}{2.71828...} \\,\\mathrm{mW} \\approx 0.9196986... \\,\\mathrm{mW} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ I \\approx 0.9197\\,\\mathrm{mW} $$\nThe final answer is the numerical value of the transmitted intensity in units of $\\mathrm{mW}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9197}\n$$", "id": "5139255"}, {"introduction": "Once we understand how a signal is generated, the next critical step is to convert that signal into a meaningful analyte concentration.
