The device has a well-mixed effective perfusate volume $V$ through which a constant volumetric flow rate $Q$ of fresh medium (with biomarker concentration $0$ at the inlet) is maintained. The tissue secretes the biomarker into the perfusate at a constant molar production rate $R$ (in $ \\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $). The biomarker is subject to first-order degradation in the perfusate with half-life $t_{1/2}$ due to proteolysis and adsorption to matrix components.

The model described is a standard continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) model with a first-order decay term, which is a fundamental concept in chemical engineering and biotransport phenomena. The derivation proceeds by formalizing the provided mass balance statement into a solvable ordinary differential equation.\n\nLet $C(t)$ be the concentration of the biomarker in the well-mixed volume $V$ at time $t$. The problem states that the outlet concentration is equal to the chamber concentration, so $C_{\\text{out}}(t) = C(t)$. The number of moles of the biomarker in the volume is $n(t) = V C(t)$. The mass conservation principle is stated as: rate of accumulation = rate of inflow - rate of outflow + rate of generation - rate of degradation. We will formulate each term for the number of moles of the biomarker.\n\n1.  **Rate of Accumulation**: This is the rate of change of the number of moles in the volume $V$. Since $V$ is a constant, the accumulation rate is $\\frac{dn}{dt} = \\frac{d(VC)}{dt} = V\\frac{dC}{dt}$.\n\n2.  **Rate of Inflow**: The volumetric flow rate is $Q$ and the biomarker concentration in the inflow is $0$. The molar inflow rate is $Q \\times C_{\\text{in}} = Q \\times 0 = 0$.\n\n3.  **Rate of Outflow**: The perfusate leaves at a flow rate $Q$ with the chamber concentration $C(t)$. The molar outflow rate is $Q C(t)$.\n\n4.  **Rate of Generation**: The tissue secretes the biomarker at a constant rate $R$, given in units of $ \\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $.\n\n5.  **Rate of Degradation**: The degradation is a first-order process, meaning its rate is proportional to the number of moles present, $n(t)$. The degradation rate is $k n(t) = k V C(t)$, where $k$ is the first-order rate constant in units of $ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $. The problem provides the half-life $t_{1/2}$. The relationship between the rate constant $k$ and the half-life $t_{1/2}$ for a first-order process is derived from the decay equation $C(t) = C(0)\\exp(-kt)$. By definition, at $t=t_{1/2}$, $C(t_{1/2}) = C(0)/2$. Substituting this gives $\\frac{C(0)}{2} = C(0)\\exp(-kt_{1/2})$, which simplifies to $\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-kt_{1/2})$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields $\\ln(\\frac{1}{2}) = -kt_{1/2}$, or $-\\ln(2) = -kt_{1/2}$. Thus, the rate constant is $k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$. The degradation rate is therefore $\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} V C(t)$.\n\nAssembling these terms into the mass balance equation:\n$$V\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0 - Q C(t) + R - \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} V C(t)$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem will be solved by first establishing the mass balance equations, then finding the steady-state solution, deriving the expression for `f`, and finally calculating `F`.\n\n**Construction of Governing Mass Balance Equations**\n\nThe total amount of cytokine in the bulk fluid is `V C(t)`. The rate of change of this amount is due to the net flux to the surface walls. The net rate of mass transfer from the bulk to the surface is given by the flux multiplied by the area `A`.\nThe mass balance for the bulk concentration `C(t)` is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} (V C(t)) = - A \\, (k_{a} C(t) - k_{d} q(t)) $$\nSince `V` is constant, this becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = - \\frac{A}{V} (k_{a} C(t) - k_{d} q(t)) $$\n\nThe total amount of adsorbed cytokine on the surface is `A q(t)`. The rate of change of this amount is equal to the net rate of mass transfer from the bulk.\nThe mass balance for the surface density `q(t)` is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} (A q(t)) = A \\, (k_{a} C(t) - k_{d} q(t)) $$\nSince `A` is constant, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{dq}{dt} = k_{a} C(t) - k_{d} q(t) $$\nThese two coupled ordinary differential equations form the governing mass balance for the system.\n\n**Derivation of the Steady-State Fraction `f`**\n\nAt steady state, the system concentrations no longer change with time, which means `dC/dt = 0` and `dq/dt = 0`. Let `C_{ss}` and `q_{ss}` denote the steady-state bulk concentration and surface density, respectively.\nSetting `dq/dt = 0` in the second mass balance equation gives:\n$$ k_{a} C_{ss} - k_{d} q_{ss} = 0 $$\n$$ q_{ss} = \\frac{k_{a}}{k_{d}} C_{ss} $$\nUsing the definition of the equilibrium surface partition coefficient, $ K = k_{a}/k_{d} $, we get the relationship at equilibrium:\n$$ q_{ss} = K C_{ss} $$\nThis indicates that at steady state, the surface density is directly proportional to the bulk concentration.\n\nThe total amount of cytokine in the system, `M_{total}`, is conserved. It is the sum of the amount in the bulk and the amount on the surface:\n$$ M_{total} = V C(t) + A q(t) $$\nAt steady state, this relation holds:\n$$ M_{total} = V C_{ss} + A q_{ss} $$\nSubstituting the equilibrium relationship `q_{ss} = K C_{ss}` into the conservation equation:\n$$ M_{total} = V C_{ss} + A (K C_{ss}) $$\n$$ M_{total} = C_{ss} (V + A K) $$\nThe steady-state fraction of cytokine remaining in the bulk, `f`, is defined as the ratio of the amount of cytokine in the bulk at steady state to the total amount of cytokine in the system.\n$$ f = \\frac{\\text{Amount in bulk at steady state}}{\\text{Total amount}} = \\frac{V C_{ss}}{M_{total}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for `M_{total}`:\n$$ f = \\frac{V C_{ss}}{C_{ss} (V + A K)} = \\frac{V}{V + A K} $$\nTo express `f` in terms of the surface area-to-volume ratio `A/V`, we divide the numerator and the denominator by `V`:\n$$ f = \\frac{V/V}{(V + A K)/V} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{A}{V} K} $$\nThis is the required expression for `f` in terms of `K` and `A/V`.\n\n**Calculation of the LOD Inflation Factor `F`**\n\nThe LOD inflation factor `F` is defined as `F = 1/f`. Using the derived expression for `f`:\n$$ F = \\frac{1}{f} = 1 + \\frac{A}{V} K $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $ A/V = 8.0 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1} $ and $ K = 2.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m} $.\n$$ F = 1 + (8.0 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}) $$\n$$ F = 1 + (8.0 \\times 2.5) \\times (10^{3} \\times 10^{-4}) $$\n$$ F = 1 + 20.0 \\times 10^{-1} $$\n$$ F = 1 + 2.0 $$\n$$ F = 3.0 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, `F = 3.00`.\n\nThis result signifies that due to adsorption onto the wetted walls of the microfluidic device, the steady-state bulk concentration is only `1/3` of what it would be without adsorption.
