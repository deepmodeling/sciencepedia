It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid mechanics (capillary action and viscous flow), well-posed with sufficient information and clear objectives, and expressed in objective, formal language. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or unrealistic conditions.\n\nThe movement of the liquid front in the nitrocellulose membrane is modeled as capillary-driven flow through a bundle of straight, cylindrical pores. The driving force is the capillary pressure, $\\Delta P_{cap}$, generated at the concave meniscus of the advancing liquid. According to the Young-Laplace equation for a cylindrical pore of radius $r$, this pressure is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{cap} = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)}{r}\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the surface tension of the liquid, and $\\theta$ is the contact angle between the liquid and the pore wall. This pressure is assumed to be constant throughout the process.\n\nThe flow is resisted by viscous forces. For laminar, incompressible, Newtonian flow through a cylindrical conduit of length $x(t)$, the relationship between the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, and the pressure drop due to viscosity, $\\Delta P_{visc}$, is described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{8 \\eta x(t)} \\Delta P_{visc}\n$$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the liquid.\n\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ can also be expressed in terms of the velocity of the liquid front, $v(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt}$.

Differentiating with respect to time gives the flow rate:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{dV}{dt} = \\pi r^2 \\frac{dx}{dt}\n$$\n\nBy equating the two expressions for the flow rate $Q$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\pi r^2 \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{\\pi r^4}{8 \\eta x(t)} \\Delta P_{visc}\n$$\n\nIn this system, the driving capillary pressure is balanced by the viscous pressure drop.

Consequently, the probability of not having the disease is $P(D^-) = 1 - P = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$.\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) is the conditional probability of having the disease given a positive test result, $P(D^+|T^+)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nPPV = P(D^+|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D^+) P(D^+)}{P(T^+)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test, found using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(T^+) = P(T^+|D^+) P(D^+) + P(T^+|D^-) P(D^-)\n$$\nWe identify the terms: $P(T^+|D^+) = Se$, $P(D^+) = P$, and $P(T^+|D^-) = 1 - P(T^-|D^-) = 1 - Sp$.\nThus, the $PPV$ formula is:\n$$\nPPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot P}{(Se \\cdot P) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P))}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values $Se=0.9$, $Sp=0.95$, and the given prevalence $P=0.2$:\n$$\nPPV = \\frac{0.9 \\cdot 0.2}{(0.9 \\cdot 0.2) + ((1 - 0.95) \\cdot (1 - 0.2))} = \\frac{0.18}{0.18 + (0.05 \\cdot 0.8)} = \\frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.04} = \\frac{0.18}{0.22} = \\frac{9}{11} \\approx 0.818181...\n$$\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$) is the conditional probability of not having the disease given a negative test result, $P(D^-|T^-)$.

As prevalence $P$ increases, the numerator ($Se \\cdot P$) increases, and the denominator, which is the total probability of a positive test, also changes such that the overall fraction increases. Therefore, in a point-of-care setting, a positive test result is more likely to indicate a true infection ($PPV$ is higher) when the disease is more common in the community.\nConversely, the $NPV$ formula shows that $NPV$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $P$. As prevalence $P$ increases, the term $(1-P)$ decreases, causing the numerator ($Sp \\cdot (1-P)$) to decrease. The overall fraction thus decreases. Therefore, a negative test result is more likely to correctly rule out infection ($NPV$ is higher) when the disease is rare.
