This can be accomplished by strictly applying the definitions of concentration and fraction.\n\nLet $V$ represent a specific volume of plasma.\nConcentration is defined as mass per unit volume. Therefore, we can express the total cfDNA concentration and the dd-cfDNA concentration as:\n$$C_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{M_{\\text{total}}}{V}$$\n$$C_{\\text{dd}} = \\frac{M_{\\text{dd}}}{V}$$\nwhere $M_{\\text{total}}$ is the total mass of cfDNA in volume $V$, and $M_{\\text{dd}}$ is the mass of donor-derived cfDNA in the same volume $V$.\n\nA fraction is defined as the ratio of a part to its whole. The problem states that the measured donor fraction $f$ can be treated as a mass fraction. Thus, $f$ is the ratio of the mass of the donor-derived portion to the total mass:\n$$f = \\frac{M_{\\text{dd}}}{M_{\\text{total}}}$$\n\nOur goal is to find $C_{\\text{dd}}$. We can rearrange the fraction definition to solve for $M_{\\text{dd}}$:\n$$M_{\\text{dd}} = f \\cdot M_{\\text{total}}$$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $M_{\\text{dd}}$ into the equation for $C_{\\text{dd}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{dd}} = \\frac{f \\cdot M_{\\text{total}}}{V}$$\n\nBy factoring out the fraction $f$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n$$C_{\\text{dd}} = f \\cdot \\left(\\frac{M_{\\text{total}}}{V}\\right)$$\n\nRecognizing that the term in the parentheses is the definition of the total concentration, $C_{\\text{total}}$, we arrive at the final relationship:\n$$C_{\\text{dd}} = f \\cdot C_{\\text{total}}$$\n\nThe given values are:\n- $C_{\\text{total}} = 12\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$\n- $f = 0.8\\%$\n\nFirst, the percentage must be converted into a dimensionless fraction for calculation:\n$$f = 0.8\\% = \\frac{0.8}{100} = 0.008$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values into our derived formula:\n$$C_{\\text{dd}} = 0.008 \\cdot 12\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$$\n$$C_{\\text{dd}} = 0.096\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The calculated value, $0.096$, has two significant figures (the digits $9$ and $6$). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.

Consider a single, well-mixed plasma compartment per millilitre, in which cfDNA fragments (both donor-derived and recipient-derived) are cleared by first-order kinetics with the same clearance rate constant for donor and recipient cfDNA, reflecting their similar fragment biology and plasma handling.
