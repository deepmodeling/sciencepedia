In dPCR, a sample is partitioned into many microreactors (e.g., droplets), and each partition is scored as positive if at least one target molecule is present and amplified, and negative otherwise. Assume partitions are independent, molecules are randomly distributed into partitions, and the number of target molecules per partition follows a Poisson distribution, consistent with the physical model of random molecular occupancy. The assay reports the fraction of positive partitions $\\hat{p}$ from a total of $N$ partitions, and the partition volume is known.\n\nA plasma sample of volume $V_{\\mathrm{plasma}} = 3.0$ mL is processed to extract cfDNA with extraction efficiency $\\epsilon = 0.65$, yielding an eluate of volume $V_{\\mathrm{elute}} = 50$ $\\mu$L. From this eluate, $V_{\\mathrm{input}} = 5$ $\\mu$L is combined with master mix to make a dPCR reaction of volume $V_{\\mathrm{reaction}} = 20$ $\\mu$L. The reaction is partitioned into $N = 20000$ droplets, each of volume $v_{\\mathrm{droplet}} = 0.85$ nL, and the observed count of positive droplets is $k = 6400$, so $\\hat{p} = k/N$.\n\nStarting from the defining properties of the Poisson distribution and the independence of partitions in dPCR, derive an estimator for the mean occupancy $\\lambda$ per partition in terms of the true positive probability $p$.

We can therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe solution is approached in two main parts as instructed: first, deriving the relationship between the observed data and the biomolecular concentration in the dPCR reaction, and second, relating this reaction-level concentration back to the original sample concentration through mass balance.\n\nPart 1: dPCR Quantification Model\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the number of target molecules in a single partition (droplet). The problem states that the distribution of molecules follows a Poisson process. Therefore, $X$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$, a parameter representing the average number of molecules per partition. The probability mass function of $X$ is given by:\n$$P(X=m) = \\frac{\\lambda^m \\exp(-\\lambda)}{m!}$$\nwhere $m$ is a non-negative integer representing the number of molecules.\n\nA partition is scored as negative if it contains zero target molecules ($m=0$). The probability of a partition being negative is:\n$$P(\\text{negative}) = P(X=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nusing the facts that $\\lambda^0=1$ and $0!=1$.\n\nA partition is scored as positive if it contains at least one target molecule ($m \\ge 1$). Let $p$ be the true probability of a partition being positive. This is the complement of a partition being negative:\n$$p = P(\\text{positive}) = P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nThis equation establishes the fundamental relationship between the true positive probability $p$ and the mean occupancy $\\lambda$. To derive an estimator for $\\lambda$, we can solve this equation for $\\lambda$:\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda) = 1 - p$$\n$$-\\lambda = \\ln(1 - p)$$\n$$\\lambda = -\\ln(1 - p)$$\nIn a real experiment, we do not know the true probability $p$. Instead, we observe the fraction of positive partitions, $\\hat{p}$, from a total of $N$ partitions. The observed number of positive partitions is $k$. Thus, the empirical estimate for $p$ is $\\hat{p} = \\frac{k}{N}$. By the invariance property of maximum likelihood estimation, the estimator for $\\lambda$, denoted $\\hat{\\lambda}$, is:\n$$\\hat{\\lambda} = -\\ln(1 - \\hat{p}) = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{k}{N}\\right)$$\n\nPart 2: Mass Balance and Concentration Calculation\n\nNext, we relate the concentration of target molecules in the dPCR reaction, $C_{\\mathrm{reaction}}$, to the original concentration in the plasma, $C_{\\mathrm{plasma}}$. The units for concentration will be copies per unit volume.\n\n1.  The total number of target molecules in the initial plasma sample is $M_{\\mathrm{plasma}} = C_{\\mathrm{plasma}} V_{\\mathrm{plasma}}$.\n2.  During cfDNA extraction, a fraction $\\epsilon$ of these molecules is recovered. The total number of molecules in the eluate is $M_{\\mathrm{elute}} = \\epsilon M_{\\mathrm{plasma}} = \\epsilon C_{\\mathrm{plasma}} V_{\\mathrm{plasma}}$.\n3.  These molecules are contained in the elution volume $V_{\\mathrm{elute}}$, so the concentration in the eluate is $C_{\\mathrm{elute}} = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{elute}}}{V_{\\mathrm{elute}}} = \\frac{\\epsilon C_{\\mathrm{plasma}} V_{\\mathrm{plasma}}}{V_{\\mathrm{elute}}}$.\n4.  A volume $V_{\\mathrm{input}}$ is taken from the eluate and added to the dPCR master mix. The number of molecules transferred is $M_{\\mathrm{input}} = C_{\\mathrm{elute}} V_{\\mathrm{input}} = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon C_{\\mathrm{plasma}} V_{\\mathrm{plasma}}}{V_{\\mathrm{elute}}}\\right) V_{\\mathrm{input}}$.\n5.  This quantity of molecules is then diluted into the final reaction volume $V_{\\mathrm{reaction}}$. The concentration in this final reaction mix is $C_{\\mathrm{reaction}} = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{input}}}{V_{\\mathrm{reaction}}} = \\frac{\\epsilon C_{\\mathrm{plasma}} V_{\\mathrm{plasma}} V_{\\mathrm{input}}}{V_{\\mathrm{elute}} V_{\\mathrm{reaction}}}$.\n\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the unknown plasma concentration:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{plasma}} = C_{\\mathrm{reaction}} \\left( \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{elute}} V_{\\mathrm{reaction}}}{\\epsilon V_{\\mathrm{plasma}} V_{\\mathrm{input}}} \\right)$$\nThe reaction concentration $C_{\\mathrm{reaction}}$ is directly related to the mean occupancy $\\lambda$ and the volume of a single droplet $v_{\\mathrm{droplet}}$. Specifically, $\\lambda$ is the average number of molecules in a volume $v_{\\mathrm{droplet}}$, so $\\lambda = C_{\\mathrm{reaction}} v_{\\mathrm{droplet}}$. This implies $C_{\\mathrm{reaction}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{v_{\\mathrm{droplet}}}$.\n\nSubstituting the estimator $\\hat{\\lambda}$ for $\\lambda$, we obtain an estimate for $C_{\\mathrm{reaction}}$ as $\\hat{C}_{\\mathrm{reaction}} = \\frac{\\hat{\\lambda}}{v_{\\mathrm{droplet}}}$. Plugging this into the equation for $C_{\\mathrm{plasma}}$ gives the final estimator:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{plasma}} = \\frac{\\hat{\\lambda}}{v_{\\mathrm{droplet}}} \\left( \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{elute}} V_{\\mathrm{reaction}}}{\\epsilon V_{\\mathrm{plasma}} V_{\\mathrm{input}}} \\right) = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - k/N)}{v_{\\mathrm{droplet}}} \\left( \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{elute}} V_{\\mathrm{reaction}}}{\\epsilon V_{\\mathrm{plasma}} V_{\\mathrm{input}}} \\right)$$\n\nPart 3: Numerical Calculation\n\nNow we substitute the given values, ensuring consistent units.

Deep targeted Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is used to quantify the Variant Allele Frequency (VAF), defined as the fraction of sequencing reads carrying a specific somatic variant at a locus. Consider a clonal somatic variant that is heterozygous in the tumor and absent from the normal genome.

The derivation proceeds from the fundamental definition of VAF as a ratio of allele counts in a mixed population of molecules.\n\nLet us define the components contributing to the cfDNA pool. The pool is a mixture composed of a fraction $\\tau$ of DNA from tumor tissue and a fraction $(1 - \\tau)$ from normal tissue. We assume random fragmentation and equal sequencing probability, which implies that the proportion of reads for a given allele at a locus reflects the proportion of that allele's copies in the cfDNA pool.\n\nThe normal tissue is diploid at the locus, meaning each normal cell contributes $2$ copies of the gene.
