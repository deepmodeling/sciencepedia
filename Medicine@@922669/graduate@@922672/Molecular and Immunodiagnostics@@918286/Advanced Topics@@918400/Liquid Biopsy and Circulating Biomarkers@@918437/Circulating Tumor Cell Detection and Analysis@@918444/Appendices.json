The derivation begins with the definition of conditional probability, which is the foundation of Bayes' theorem.\n\nThe PPV is defined as the probability of a subject having the disease ($D$) given that they have a positive test result ($T^{+}$):\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\mathbb{P}(D \\mid T^{+})\n$$\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, this can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(T^{+} \\mid D) \\mathbb{P}(D)}{\\mathbb{P}(T^{+})}\n$$\nThe terms in the numerator are given in the problem statement:\n- The sensitivity, $Se = \\mathbb{P}(T^{+} \\mid D)$.\n- The prevalence, $p = \\mathbb{P}(D)$.\n\nThe denominator, $\\mathbb{P}(T^{+})$, is the overall probability of a positive test result in the population.

Despite the high sensitivity ($85\\%$) and extremely high specificity ($99.5\\%$) of the assay, the very low prevalence of the disease ($0.2\\%$) in the screening population means that the vast majority of positive test results are incorrect. This would lead to a large number of healthy individuals undergoing unnecessary, expensive, and potentially invasive follow-up diagnostic procedures (e.g., biopsies, advanced imaging), causing significant patient anxiety and a substantial burden on the healthcare system.

This option is a valid candidate.\n\n### Conclusion and Option Analysis\n\nWe summarize the calculated sensitivities ($S$) and leukocyte false positive rates ($FPR_L$) for all logics. All logics satisfy the condition $FPR_L  0.01$.\n\n| Logic | Sensitivity ($S$) | Leukocyte FPR ($FPR_L$) |\n|---|---|---|\n| A | $0.4855$ | $5 \\times 10^{-7}$ |\n| B | $0.7918$ | $1.495 \\times 10^{-4}$ |\n| C | $0.9495$ | $0.00803$ |\n| D | $0.8078$ | $0.00800$ |\n| E | $0.4547$ | $0.008$ |\n\nThe task is to find the logic that maximizes sensitivity. Comparing the sensitivities:\n$S_C (0.9495) > S_D (0.8078) > S_B (0.7918) > S_A (0.4855) > S_E (0.4547)$.\n\nLogic C provides the highest sensitivity.\n\n-   **Option A**: Logic A has a sensitivity of $S_A \\approx 0.485$. This is not the maximum. **Incorrect**.\n-   **Option B**: Logic B has a sensitivity of $S_B \\approx 0.792$. This is not the maximum. **Incorrect**.\n-   **Option C**: Logic C has a sensitivity of $S_C \\approx 0.949$, which is the highest among all candidates, and its $FPR_L \\approx 0.00803$ is strictly below $0.01$. This is the optimal choice. **Correct**.\n-   **Option D**: Logic D has a sensitivity of $S_D \\approx 0.808$. This is not the maximum. **Incorrect**.\n-   **Option E**: Logic E has a sensitivity of $S_E \\approx 0.455$. This is not the maximum. **Incorrect**.\n\nThe single candidate logic that maximizes expected sensitivity while keeping the leukocyte false positive rate strictly below $0.01$ is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "5100047"}]}
