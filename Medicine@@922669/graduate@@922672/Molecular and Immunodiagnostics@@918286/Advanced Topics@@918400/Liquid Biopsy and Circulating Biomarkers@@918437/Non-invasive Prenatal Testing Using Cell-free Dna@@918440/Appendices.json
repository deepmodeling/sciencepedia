Consider a sample with a total of $30{,}000{,}000$ uniquely mapped autosomal reads, of which $1{,}050{,}000$ map to chromosome $21$. The euploid reference cohort yields a mean fraction for chromosome $21$ of $0.015$ and a between-sample standard deviation of $0.0005$ for the same normalization and counting scheme.\n\nStarting from the fundamental statistical notion of standardization—viewing the observed fraction as a realization from a distribution characterized by a reference mean and standard deviation under the null hypothesis of euploidy—and assuming that, due to the large number of reads, the standardized deviate is approximately standard normal, compute the standardized deviate (z-score) for chromosome $21$ in this sample.\n\nThen, interpret whether the result is consistent with overrepresentation of chromosome $21$ that would be used to flag a potential trisomy $21$ call in a research setting that uses a two-sided normal cutoff of $|z| \\ge 3$.\n\nReport only the z-score as a pure number, rounded to three significant figures, in your final numeric answer. No units are required.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a standardized deviate, or z-score, for the fraction of sequencing reads corresponding to chromosome $21$ in a non-invasive prenatal test. This score is used to assess whether the observed fraction is statistically deviant from a reference population of euploid samples, which would suggest a chromosomal aneuploidy like trisomy $21$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the observed fraction of reads for chromosome $21$ in the given sample. Let $N_{\\text{total}}$ be the total number of uniquely mapped autosomal reads and $N_{21}$ be the number of those reads that map to chromosome $21$.\n\nThe given values are:\nTotal autosomal reads, $N_{\\text{total}} = 30{,}000{,}000$.\nChromosome $21$ reads, $N_{21} = 1{,}050{,}000$.\n\nThe observed fraction of reads for chromosome $21$, denoted as $f_{\\text{obs}}$, is the ratio of $N_{21}$ to $N_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$f_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{N_{21}}{N_{\\text{total}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$f_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{1{,}050{,}000}{30{,}000{,}000} = \\frac{1.05}{30} = 0.035$$\n\nNext, we calculate the z-score. The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an observation is from the mean of a reference distribution. The problem specifies that the reference distribution is derived from a euploid cohort and provides its mean and standard deviation.\n\nLet $\\mu_{\\text{ref}}$ be the mean fraction for chromosome $21$ in the reference euploid cohort, and let $\\sigma_{\\text{ref}}$ be the between-sample standard deviation for this fraction. The problem provides:\nMean reference fraction, $\\mu_{\\text{ref}} = 0.015$.\nStandard deviation of the reference fraction, $\\sigma_{\\text{ref}} = 0.0005$.\n\nThe formula for the z-score is:\n$$z = \\frac{f_{\\text{obs}} - \\mu_{\\text{ref}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{ref}}}$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated $f_{\\text{obs}}$ and the given reference parameters:\n$$z = \\frac{0.035 - 0.015}{0.0005}$$\n$$z = \\frac{0.020}{0.0005}$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can express the numerator and denominator in scientific notation or as a ratio of integers:\n$$z = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{5 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 10^{-2 - (-4)} = 0.4 \\times 10^{2} = 40$$\n\nThe calculated z-score for chromosome $21$ in this sample is exactly $40$.\n\nThe problem also asks for an interpretation of this result in a research context where a potential trisomy $21$ is flagged if the absolute value of the z-score, $|z|$, is greater than or equal to $3$.\nIn our case, $|z| = |40| = 40$.\nSince $40 \\ge 3$, the observed fraction of chromosome $21$ reads is $40$ standard deviations above the mean of the euploid reference population. This is a very strong statistical signal indicating a significant overrepresentation of chromosome $21$. Such a result is highly consistent with the presence of an extra copy of chromosome $21$ in the fetal genome, and would be flagged as high-risk for trisomy $21$.\n\nThe final answer requires the z-score as a pure number rounded to three significant figures.

This quantity is also known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of the test.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability $P(D|T^+)$ is given by:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, considering the two mutually exclusive scenarios in which a positive test can occur: a true positive (the fetus has trisomy 21 and the test is positive) and a false positive (the fetus does not have trisomy 21 but the test is positive).\n\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\n\nThe term $P(T^+|D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given that the condition is absent.

We assume the fetus is the subject of testing for monosomy X as before.\n\nThe presence of maternal mosaicism alters the average copy number of the X chromosome contributed by the mother to the cfDNA pool. The maternal autosomal copy number remains $2$. The average maternal X-chromosome copy number, $CN_{X,m, \\text{mosaic}}$, becomes:\n$$CN_{X,m, \\text{mosaic}} = m \\cdot (1) + (1-m) \\cdot (2) = m + 2 - 2m = 2 - m$$\n\nLet us re-calculate the effective X-chromosome copy number, $CN_{X, \\text{eff, mosaic}}$, in the plasma mixture, still assuming a $45,\\mathrm{X}$ fetus ($CN_{X,f} = 1$):\n$$CN_{X, \\text{eff, mosaic}} = (1 - f) \\cdot CN_{X,m, \\text{mosaic}} + f \\cdot CN_{X,f}$$\n$$CN_{X, \\text{eff, mosaic}} = (1 - f)(2 - m) + f(1)$$\n$$CN_{X, \\text{eff, mosaic}} = 2 - m - 2f + mf + f = 2 - f - m(1-f)$$\n\nThe effective autosomal copy number is still $2$.

A term from the fetal monosomy X: $-\\frac{f}{2}$.\n2.  A term from the maternal mosaicism: $-\\frac{m(1-f)}{2}$.\n\n**Explanation of Confounding:**\n\nThe NIPT model assumes the mother is constitutionally euploid ($46,\\mathrm{XX}$), so any deviation from the baseline is attributed to the fetus. Maternal mosaicism violates this assumption and confounds the interpretation in a critical way.\n\nThe maternal mosaicism introduces a negative bias in the X-chromosome measurement that is independent of the fetal status. From the expression $\\Delta_{X, \\text{obs}} = -\\frac{f}{2} - \\frac{m(1-f)}{2}$, we can see that the observed negative shift is of a greater magnitude than would be expected from the fetal aneuploidy alone.\n\nThe primary confounding effect is the risk of a **false positive** result. Let's consider a scenario where the fetus is actually euploid (e.g., $46,\\mathrm{XX}$ or $46,\\mathrm{XY}$), but the mother has undetected $45,\\mathrm{X}$ mosaicism.\nIf the fetus is a euploid female ($46,\\mathrm{XX}$), then $CN_{X,f} = 2$. The observed shift would be:\n$$\\Delta_{X, \\text{euploid-fetus}} = \\frac{(1 - f)(2-m) + f(2)}{2} - 1 = \\frac{2 - m - 2f + mf + 2f}{2} - 1$$\n$$= \\frac{2 - m + mf}{2} - 1 = 1 - \\frac{m(1-f)}{2} - 1 = -\\frac{m(1-f)}{2}$$\nIf the fetus is a euploid male ($46,\\mathrm{XY}$), then $CN_{X,f} = 1$, and the observed shift would be identical to the expression derived for the $45,\\mathrm{X}$ fetus with a mosaic mother, $\\Delta_{X, \\text{obs}} = -\\frac{f}{2} - \\frac{m(1-f)}{2}$.\n\nIn both euploid fetal cases, the maternal mosaicism induces a negative shift in $\\Delta_X$. A testing algorithm, unaware of the maternal condition, would interpret this negative shift ($-\\frac{m(1-f)}{2}$) as evidence for fetal monosomy X. For instance, if $m=0.1$ and $f=0.1$, the shift would be $-\\frac{0.1(1-0.1)}{2} = -0.045$. This value is nearly identical to the $-0.05$ shift expected for a true fetal monosomy X at the same fetal fraction. Thus, the test would very likely produce a false positive result, incorrectly flagging a healthy fetus for a chromosomal abnormality that is actually present in the mother. This demonstrates that maternal sex chromosome aneuploidy is a significant biological confounder for fetal sex chromosome aneuploidy screening via NIPT.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.05}\n$$", "id": "4364764"}]}
