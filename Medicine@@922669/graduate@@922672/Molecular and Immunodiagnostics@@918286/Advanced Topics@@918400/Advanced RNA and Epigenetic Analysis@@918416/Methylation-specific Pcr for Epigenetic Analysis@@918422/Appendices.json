This first exercise applies basic probability to demonstrate how even a small, per-site failure rate can accumulate across a locus, creating templates that mimic methylation. By calculating the fraction of unmethylated molecules that remain partially unconverted, you will gain a quantitative appreciation for the primary source of false-positive signals in MSP assays [@problem_id:5132654].", "problem": "In a bisulfite-based epigenetic assay, unmethylated cytosine residues are deaminated to uracil with a per-site conversion probability $p$ during sodium bisulfite treatment, while methylated cytosines remain as cytosines. Consider an unmethylated locus comprising $20$ CpG dinucleotide sites. Assume that conversion events at distinct CpG cytosines are independent and identically distributed, and that downstream polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification accurately copies the bisulfite-converted template (i.e., no additional sequence errors are introduced during copying that affect cytosine identity). Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) primer specificity relies on the expectation that all unmethylated CpG cytosines within the primer-binding region are converted; any residual unconverted cytosine can mimic methylation and promote mis-priming.\n\nStarting from the Bernoulli-trial model for independent chemical conversions and the complement rule for probabilities, derive an expression for the expected fraction of bisulfite-treated DNA molecules that retain at least one unconverted cytosine across these $20$ CpG sites as a function of $p$ and the number of sites. Then evaluate this expression at $p = 0.99$ for the given locus of $20$ CpGs. Round your final numerical result to four significant figures and report it as a pure decimal (no units). After computing the number, briefly explain how this fraction affects MSP primer specificity in terms of potential false-positive priming on truly unmethylated templates.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of an expression for the expected fraction of bisulfite-treated DNA molecules that retain at least one unconverted cytosine, followed by a numerical evaluation and a conceptual explanation regarding Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP) specificity.\n\nThe process of bisulfite conversion at each of the $N$ CpG sites can be modeled as a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. Let $N$ be the number of CpG sites, which is given as $N=20$. Let $p$ be the per-site probability of a successful conversion of an unmethylated cytosine to a uracil. The problem states this probability is $p=0.99$.\n\nFor a single unmethylated CpG site, the outcome is binary:\n1. The cytosine is successfully converted to uracil, with probability $p$.\n2. The cytosine fails to convert and remains a cytosine, with probability $1-p$.\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction of molecules that retain *at least one* unconverted cytosine. Let $A$ be the event that a DNA molecule has at least one unconverted cytosine across the $N=20$ sites. It is more straightforward to first calculate the probability of the complement event, $A^c$, which is the event that *no* cytosines remain unconverted. This is equivalent to the event that *all* $N$ cytosines are successfully converted to uracil.\n\nSince the conversion events at each of the $N$ sites are assumed to be independent and identically distributed, the probability of all $N$ sites being converted is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(A^c) = P(\\text{site 1 converted AND site 2 converted AND ... AND site N converted})$$\n$$P(A^c) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} P(\\text{site i converted}) = p \\times p \\times \\dots \\times p = p^N$$\nThe desired probability, $P(A)$, is the probability of the complement of $A^c$. Using the complement rule for probabilities, we have:\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(A^c)$, we arrive at the general expression for the fraction of molecules with at least one unconverted cytosine as a function of $p$ and the number of sites $N$:\n$$P(A) = 1 - p^N$$\nThis is the required derived expression.\n\nNext, we must evaluate this expression for the given values: $N=20$ CpG sites and a conversion probability of $p=0.99$.\n$$P(A) = 1 - (0.99)^{20}$$\nCalculating the value of $(0.99)^{20}$:\n$$(0.99)^{20} \\approx 0.817906939...$$\nNow, we find the final probability:\n$$P(A) = 1 - 0.817906939... \\approx 0.182093061...$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $8$, $2$, and $0$. The fifth digit is $9$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$P(A) \\approx 0.1821$$\nThis is the expected fraction of molecules from a completely unmethylated locus that will be incompletely converted.\n\nFinally, the explanation of how this fraction affects MSP primer specificity:\nMethylation-Specific PCR (MSP) uses two pairs of primers: one pair (M-primers) is designed to anneal to DNA sequences where CpG cytosines were methylated and thus remained as cytosines after bisulfite treatment, and another pair (U-primers) is designed for sequences where CpGs were unmethylated and thus converted to uracils (which are then read as thymines by the polymerase). The specificity of the M-primer pair relies on mismatches with converted (uracil/thymine) sites in unmethylated templates, which should prevent annealing and amplification.\n\nThe calculated fraction, approximately $0.1821$ or $18.21\\%$, represents the proportion of DNA molecules originating from a completely unmethylated locus that, due to incomplete conversion, retain at least one cytosine at a CpG position. These molecules now possess a sequence that can be recognized by the M-primer, mimicking a truly methylated template. When the M-primer anneals to such an incompletely converted unmethylated template, it can initiate amplification, leading to a PCR product in the \"methylated\" reaction. This phenomenon constitutes a false-positive result for methylation, as it indicates the presence of methylation where none existed. A value of $0.1821$ suggests that a substantial fraction of the unmethylated template population can serve as a substrate for false-positive priming, thereby significantly reducing the specificity of the MSP assay and its ability to accurately discriminate between methylated and unmethylated states.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1821}$$", "id": "5132654"}, {"introduction": "Since perfect bisulfite conversion is unattainable, measuring its efficiency is a critical quality control step.

Sodium bisulfite deaminates unmethylated cytosine to uracil, which is read as thymine after PCR and Sanger sequencing, while methylated cytosine remains as cytosine. In Sanger sequencing, fluorescent chromatogram peak heights are used to infer base composition at each position. Because dye channels have differing sensitivities and there is baseline signal, peak heights must be corrected before quantification.\n\nConsider an amplicon containing a control locus with $6$ non-CpG cytosine positions known to be completely unmethylated in the input DNA.

The parameters $s_T$, $s_C$, $b_T$, and $b_C$ are known, while the $k_i$ values are unknown and vary between sites. The core task is to find an estimator for $p$ that is independent of the unknown $k_i$.\n\nFirst, we must correct the raw peak heights for baseline offset and differential dye sensitivity to recover a signal that is directly proportional to the amount of DNA product. Let us define the baseline-corrected peak heights, $H_T'^{(i)}$ and $H_C'^{(i)}$, as:\n$$H_T'^{(i)} \\;=\\; H_T^{(i)} - b_T \\;=\\; s_T\\,k_i\\,p$$\n$$H_C'^{(i)} \\;=\\; H_C^{(i)} - b_C \\;=\\; s_C\\,k_i\\,(1-p)$$\n\nThese corrected heights are now proportional to the product amounts, but still scaled by the dye sensitivities. To obtain quantities that are directly proportional to the molar amounts of thymine and cytosine amplicons, we must divide by the respective dye sensitivity factors.

From the equation $h_T^{(i)} = k_i\\,p$, we can write $p = h_T^{(i)}/k_i$. Substituting the expression for $k_i$:\n$$p_i = \\frac{h_T^{(i)}}{h_T^{(i)} + h_C^{(i)}}$$\nThis provides an estimate of $p$ from a single site, $p_i$, which is independent of $k_i$.\n\nTo obtain a single, robust estimate of $p$ from all $N=6$ control sites, we can pool the data.
