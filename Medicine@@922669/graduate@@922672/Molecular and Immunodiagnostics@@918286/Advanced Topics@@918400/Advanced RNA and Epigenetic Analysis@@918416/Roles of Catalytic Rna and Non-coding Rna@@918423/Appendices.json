A solution can be derived from the provided information.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe goal is to derive the normalized dose–response curve $A([L])$ and then find the concentration $[L]_{1/2}$ corresponding to half-maximal activation.\n\nAccording to definition (ii), the normalized activation $A([L])$ is the fraction of riboswitches in the ligand-bound state. Let $[R]_T$ be the total concentration of the riboswitch aptamer. The total concentration is the sum of the concentrations of the unbound aptamer, $[R]$, and the ligand-bound aptamer-ligand complex, $[RL]$. This conservation of mass is expressed as:\n$$[R]_T = [R] + [RL]$$\nThe fraction of bound riboswitches is therefore $\\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T}$. We can write the activation function as:\n$$A([L]) = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T}$$\nOur goal is to express this fraction as a function of the free ligand concentration, $[L]$. We start with the given equilibrium expression for the dissociation constant, $K_D$:\n$$K_D = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nFrom the conservation of mass equation, we can express the concentration of unbound aptamer, $[R]$, in terms of the total and bound concentrations:\n$$[R] = [R]_T - [RL]$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $K_D$:\n$$K_D = \\frac{([R]_T - [RL])[L]}{[RL]}$$\nWe now solve this equation for the fraction $\\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T}$. First, we rearrange to isolate terms involving $[RL]$:\n$$K_D [RL] = ([R]_T - [RL])[L]$$\n$$K_D [RL] = [R]_T [L] - [RL][L]$$\n$$K_D [RL] + [RL][L] = [R]_T [L]$$\nFactor out $[RL]$ from the left-hand side:\n$$[RL](K_D + [L]) = [R]_T [L]$$\nFinally, divide both sides by $[R]_T$ and by $(K_D + [L])$ to obtain the desired fraction:\n$$\\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T} = \\frac{[L]}{K_D + [L]}$$\nThis provides the derived expression for the normalized dose–response curve:\n$$A([L]) = \\frac{[L]}{K_D + [L]}$$\nThis equation is a form of the Hill-Langmuir equation for the case where the Hill coefficient, $n$, is equal to $1$, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n\nNext, we must compute the ligand concentration $[L]_{1/2}$ at which the activation is half-maximal. By definition, this occurs when $A([L]_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$. We set our derived expression equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{[L]_{1/2}}{K_D + [L]_{1/2}}$$\nTo solve for $[L]_{1/2}$, we cross-multiply:\n$$1 \\cdot (K_D + [L]_{1/2}) = 2 \\cdot [L]_{1/2}$$\n$$K_D + [L]_{1/2} = 2[L]_{1/2}$$\nSubtracting $[L]_{1/2}$ from both sides yields:\n$$K_D = [L]_{1/2}$$\nThis result confirms a fundamental property of single-site binding equilibria: the ligand concentration required to achieve half-maximal binding is numerically equal to the dissociation constant, $K_D$.\n\nThe problem provides the value $K_D = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. Therefore:\n$$[L]_{1/2} = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe problem requests the final answer to be expressed in micromolar and rounded to three significant figures.\n$$[L]_{1/2} = 1.00\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe numerical value for the final answer is $1.00$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.00}$$", "id": "5158190"}, {"introduction": "While some RNAs regulate through binding alone, others act as catalysts.

Let the general base group be denoted by $B$ and its protonated form by $BH^+$. The relevant acid dissociation equilibrium is:\n$$\nBH^+ \\rightleftharpoons B + H^+\n$$\nThe acid dissociation constant is $K_{a,\\text{B}}^{\\text{HH}} = \\frac{[B][H^+]}{[BH^+]}$. The catalytically active species is $B$. The fraction of the enzyme in this active state is:\n$$\nf_{\\text{active}}^{\\text{HH}} = \\frac{[B]}{[B] + [BH^+]}\n$$\nUsing the definition of $K_{a,\\text{B}}^{\\text{HH}}$, we can express $[BH^+]$ in terms of $[B]$: $[BH^+] = \\frac{[B][H^+]}{K_{a,\\text{B}}^{\\text{HH}}}$. Substituting this into the expression for the fraction:\n$$\nf_{\\text{active}}^{\\text{HH}} = \\frac{[B]}{[B] + \\frac{[B][H^+]}{K_{a,\\text{B}}^{\\text{HH}}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[H^+]}{K_{a,\\text{B}}^{\\text{HH}}}}\n$$\nUsing the definitions $\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}([H^+])$ and $\\mathrm{p}K_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$, the ratio becomes $\\frac{[H^+]}{K_{a,\\text{B}}^{\\text{HH}}} = \\frac{10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}}{10^{-\\mathrm{p}K_{a,\\text{B}}^{\\text{HH}}}} = 10^{\\mathrm{p}K_{a,\\text{B}}^{\\text{HH}} - \\mathrm{pH}}$.
