Let $N_P$ be the total number of positive specimens and $N_N$ be the total number of negative specimens. From the givens, $N_P=5$ and $N_N=5$. For a given threshold $\\tau$, let $TP(\\tau)$ be the number of true positives (positives with score $\\ge \\tau$) and $FP(\\tau)$ be the number of false positives (negatives with score $\\ge \\tau$).\n\nThe definitions are:\n- True Positive Rate (Sensitivity): $TPR(\\tau) = \\frac{TP(\\tau)}{N_P}$\n- False Positive Rate: $FPR(\\tau) = \\frac{FP(\\tau)}{N_N}$\n\nThe ROC curve is constructed by systematically varying the threshold $\\tau$.

The pre-test probability of disease is denoted by $p$, so $P(D) = p$. Consequently, the probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - p$.\n\nThe first step is to derive an expression for the post-test probability of disease given a positive test, $P(D \\mid T^{+})$, in terms of $p$ and the positive likelihood ratio, $LR^{+}$. We start from the odds formulation of Bayes' theorem.\n\nThe pre-test odds of disease are defined as the ratio of the probability of having the disease to the probability of not having it:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} = \\frac{p}{1-p} $$\nThe post-test odds of disease, after receiving a positive test result, are similarly defined:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{P(D \\mid T^{+})}{P(D^c \\mid T^{+})} $$\nBayes' theorem can be expressed in terms of odds and the likelihood ratio. The post-test odds are equal to the pre-test odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio. For a positive test, this is:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR^{+} $$\nThe positive likelihood ratio, $LR^{+}$, is defined as the ratio of the true positive rate (sensitivity) to the false positive rate:\n$$ LR^{+} = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid D)}{P(T^{+} \\mid D^c)} $$\nSubstituting the expression for pre-test odds, we have:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{p}{1-p} \\times LR^{+} $$\nTo find the post-test probability, $P(D \\mid T^{+})$, we must convert the post-test odds back to a probability. For any event $A$ with probability $P(A)$, the odds are $O(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{1-P(A)}$. Solving for $P(A)$ yields the relationship:\n$$ P(A) = \\frac{O(A)}{1 + O(A)} $$\nApplying this conversion to the post-test odds gives the post-test probability:\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}$:\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{\\frac{p}{1-p} \\times LR^{+}}{1 + \\frac{p}{1-p} \\times LR^{+}} $$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $(1-p)$:\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{p \\cdot LR^{+}}{(1-p) + p \\cdot LR^{+}} $$\nThis is the required expression for the post-test probability of disease in terms of the pre-test probability $p$ and the positive likelihood ratio $LR^{+}$.\n\nThe second step is to use this formula to calculate the post-test probabilities for the two specified populations and find their absolute difference, $\\Delta$.\nThe given values are:\nPositive likelihood ratio: $LR^{+} = 6.5$.\nPre-test probability in the high-risk population: $p_{\\mathrm{H}} = 0.20$.\nPre-test probability in the general population: $p_{\\mathrm{G}} = 0.02$.\n\nFor the high-risk hepatology clinic population ($p_{\\mathrm{H}} = 0.20$):\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}; p_{\\mathrm{H}}) = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{H}} \\cdot LR^{+}}{1 - p_{\\mathrm{H}} + p_{\\mathrm{H}} \\cdot LR^{+}} = \\frac{0.20 \\times 6.5}{1 - 0.20 + (0.20 \\times 6.5)} $$\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}; p_{\\mathrm{H}}) = \\frac{1.3}{0.80 + 1.3} = \\frac{1.3}{2.1} \\approx 0.6190476... $$\nFor the general screening population ($p_{\\mathrm{G}} = 0.02$):\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}; p_{\\mathrm{G}}) = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{G}} \\cdot LR^{+}}{1 - p_{\\mathrm{G}} + p_{\\mathrm{G}} \\cdot LR^{+}} = \\frac{0.02 \\times 6.5}{1 - 0.02 + (0.02 \\times 6.5)} $$\n$$ P(D \\mid T^{+}; p_{\\mathrm{G}}) = \\frac{0.13}{0.98 + 0.13} = \\frac{0.13}{1.11} \\approx 0.1171171... $$\nThe absolute change in post-test probability, $\\Delta$, is the difference between these two values:\n$$ \\Delta = P(D \\mid T^{+}; p_{\\mathrm{H}}) - P(D \\mid T^{+}; p_{\\mathrm{G}}) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\approx 0.6190476 - 0.1171171 = 0.5019305... $$\nThe problem requires the final numerical value to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $5$, $0$, $1$, and $9$. The fifth significant figure is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$ \\Delta \\approx 0.5019 $$\nThis result demonstrates the profound impact of pre-test probability on the predictive value of a diagnostic test. Even with an unchanged likelihood ratio, the same positive test result confers a much higher probability of disease in a high-risk population compared to a low-risk one.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5019}$$", "id": "5133319"}]}
