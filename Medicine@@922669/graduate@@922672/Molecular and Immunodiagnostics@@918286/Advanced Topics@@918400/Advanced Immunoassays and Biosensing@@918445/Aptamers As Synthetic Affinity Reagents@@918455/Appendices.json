The solution comprises two main parts: first, determining the dissociation rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, from the dissociation half-life, $t_{1/2}$; second, using this result and the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$, to determine the association rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of the Dissociation Rate Constant ($k_{\\mathrm{off}}$)**\n\nThe problem specifies that during the dissociation phase, the system is under \"sink conditions,\" where the concentration of the free target, $T$, is effectively zero. This prevents any significant re-binding of the aptamer, $A$, to the target. Therefore, the dissociation of the aptamer-target complex, $AT$, can be modeled as an irreversible, unimolecular decay process:\n$$AT \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{off}}} A + T$$\nThe rate of this reaction is described by a first-order differential equation, as stipulated in the problem statement. The rate of change of the concentration of the complex, $[AT]$, is proportional to its current concentration:\n$$\\frac{d[AT]}{dt} = -k_{\\mathrm{off}}[AT]$$\nTo find the concentration of the complex as a function of time, we solve this differential equation by separation of variables. Let $[AT]_0$ be the concentration of the complex at the beginning of the dissociation phase ($t=0$).\n$$\\int_{[AT]_0}^{[AT](t)} \\frac{d[AT]}{[AT]} = \\int_{0}^{t} -k_{\\mathrm{off}} dt$$\nIntegrating both sides yields:\n$$\\ln([AT](t)) - \\ln([AT]_0) = -k_{\\mathrm{off}} t$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{[AT](t)}{[AT]_0}\\right) = -k_{\\mathrm{off}} t$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the equation for mono-exponential decay, which is consistent with the problem description:\n$$[AT](t) = [AT]_0 \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{off}} t)$$\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time required for the concentration of the complex to decrease to half of its initial value. At $t=t_{1/2}$, we have $[AT](t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}[AT]_0$. Substituting this into the decay equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}[AT]_0 = [AT]_0 \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{off}} t_{1/2})$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{off}} t_{1/2})$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_{\\mathrm{off}} t_{1/2}$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$, we get:\n$$-\\ln(2) = -k_{\\mathrm{off}} t_{1/2}$$\nSolving for $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, we arrive at the required expression:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{off}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\nNow, we can calculate the numerical value of $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$. The given half-life is $t_{1/2} = 5$ minutes. To express $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ in units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, we must first convert $t_{1/2}$ to seconds:\n$$t_{1/2} = 5 \\text{ min} \\times \\frac{60 \\text{ s}}{1 \\text{ min}} = 300 \\text{ s}$$\nSubstituting this value into our expression for $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{off}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{300 \\text{ s}} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{300 \\text{ s}} \\approx 0.00231049 \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\approx 2.31 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation and Calculation of the Association Rate Constant ($k_{\\mathrm{on}}$)**\n\nThe second part of the problem is to determine the association rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$, using the calculated $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ and the given equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$. We start from the law of mass action for the reversible $1:1$ binding reaction at equilibrium:\n$$A + T \\underset{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{\\stackrel{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} AT$$\nThe rate of the forward (association) reaction is $v_{\\mathrm{fwd}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}}[A][T]$, and the rate of the reverse (dissociation) reaction is $v_{\\mathrm{rev}} = k_{\\mathrm{off}}[AT]$. At chemical equilibrium, the net rate of reaction is zero, which means the forward and reverse rates are equal:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{fwd}} = v_{\\mathrm{rev}}$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{on}}[A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}[T]_{\\mathrm{eq}} = k_{\\mathrm{off}}[AT]_{\\mathrm{eq}}$$\nwhere the subscript 'eq' denotes equilibrium concentrations. The equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined by the ratio of concentrations at equilibrium:\n$$K_D = \\frac{[A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}[T]_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{[AT]_{\\mathrm{eq}}}$$\nBy rearranging the rate equality, we can express the ratio of rate constants:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}} = \\frac{[A]_{\\mathrm{eq}}[T]_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{[AT]_{\\mathrm{eq}}}$$\nThis establishes the fundamental relationship between the kinetic rate constants and the thermodynamic equilibrium constant:\n$$K_D = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}$$\nTo find $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$, we rearrange this equation:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{K_D}$$\nNow, we can calculate the numerical value of $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$. We are given $K_D = 2$ nM. To ensure unit consistency for $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ in $\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, we must convert $K_D$ from nanomolar (nM) to molar (M):\n$$K_D = 2 \\text{ nM} = 2 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ M}$$\nUsing the unrounded value of $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ for better precision in the intermediate calculation ($k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\approx 0.00231049 \\text{ s}^{-1}$):\n$$k_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\frac{0.00231049 \\text{ s}^{-1}}{2 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ M}} \\approx 1155245 \\text{ M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{on}} \\approx 1.16 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\nThe final numerical results are $k_{\\mathrm{off}} = 2.31 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ s}^{-1}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{on}} = 1.16 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2.31 \\times 10^{-3} & 1.16 \\times 10^{6} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5093770"}, {"introduction": "After characterizing an aptamer's intrinsic binding, the next step is to evaluate its performance within a diagnostic assay.
