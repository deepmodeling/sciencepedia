To define the decision rule for detection near the lower end of the dynamic range, the laboratory adopts the following standard approach rooted in parametric statistical decision theory. For blank spots, replicate signals are modeled as draws from a Normal distribution with mean background $\\mu_{b}$ and variance $\\sigma_{b}^{2}$; the Limit of Blank (LoB) is set as the decision threshold equal to the upper tail quantile of the blank distribution so that the probability that a blank generates a value above LoB is $0.05$. For low-concentration samples near the detection boundary, replicate signals are modeled as draws from a Normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ that depends on concentration and variance $\\sigma_{\\text{low}}^{2}$ estimated from low-level replicates.\n\nDefine the Limit of Detection (LoD) as the smallest mean signal $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$ such that, when using the decision threshold equal to LoB, the probability that a low-level sample yields a measured signal exceeding LoB is $0.95$.

If it's valid, I must provide a full, reasoned solution. If invalid, I must explain the flaws.\n3.  **Core Concepts:** The problem involves statistical decision theory, specifically the definitions of Limit of Blank (LoB) and Limit of Detection (LoD) based on Normal distribution properties. These are standard concepts in analytical chemistry and immunodiagnostics.\n4.  **Validation:**\n    *   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is well-grounded. The definitions of LoB and LoD based on Type I ($\\alpha$) and Type II ($\\beta$) error rates are standard (here, $\\alpha=0.05$ for LoB and $\\beta=0.05$ for LoD). Using a Normal distribution is a common, valid statistical model for this purpose. The linear calibration model is also appropriate for a local range.\n    *   **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides clear definitions and all necessary numerical values ($\\text{LoB}$, $\\sigma_{\\text{low}}$, $S_0$, $\\alpha$) to calculate a unique LoD. It is self-contained and not contradictory.\n    *   **Objectivity:** The language is formal, quantitative, and free of subjective elements.\n    *   **All other validation criteria are met.** The problem is not trivial, unrealistic, or ill-structured. There are no signs of invalidity.\n5.  **Solution Path (since the problem is valid):**\n    *   **Derive $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$:** I will start from the probabilistic definition of LoD: the probability that a sample with mean signal $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$ exceeds the $\\text{LoB}$ threshold is $0.95$. Assuming a Normal distribution for the low-level signal, $X_{\\text{low}} \\sim N(\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}, \\sigma_{\\text{low}}^2)$, this can be written as $P(X_{\\text{low}}  \\text{LoB}) = 0.95$. By standardizing the variable, I can express $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$ in terms of $\\text{LoB}$, $\\sigma_{\\text{low}}$, and a standard normal quantile ($z$-score).\n    *   **Derive Concentration LoD ($C_{\\text{LoD}}$):** Using the provided linear calibration model, $S(C) = S_0 + \\alpha C$, I will relate the mean signal at LoD, $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$, to its corresponding concentration, $C_{\\text{LoD}}$. This will yield a final symbolic expression for $C_{\\text{LoD}}$.\n    *   **Numerical Calculation:** I will substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula for $C_{\\text{LoD}}$ and calculate the result, rounding to four significant figures as requested. I will use the standard value for the relevant normal quantile, $z_{0.95} \\approx 1.645$.\n    *   **Robustness Analysis:** Finally, I will address the last part of the problem. I will discuss how the derived formulas, which are based on the Normal distribution, would be affected if the underlying data distribution were not Normal (e.g., skewed or heavy-tailed). I will also discuss the impact of heteroscedasticity (variance changing with the mean), which challenges the assumption of a single $\\sigma_{\\text{low}}$ value.\n6.  **Formatting:** I will adhere strictly to the LaTeX mandate for all mathematical entities (including numbers) and the overall XML structure.

The use of Normal distributions and a linear calibration model are standard assumptions for this type of analysis. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides clear, unambiguous definitions and a complete set of numerical values required to derive a unique solution. The setup is mathematically consistent and sufficient.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the analytical expressions from the statistical definitions provided, and then substituting the given numerical values.\n\nLet $X_{\\text{low}}$ be the random variable representing the signal from a low-concentration sample. According to the problem, its distribution is Normal with a mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma_{\\text{low}}^2$, denoted as $X_{\\text{low}} \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma_{\\text{low}}^2)$. The Limit of Detection ($\\text{LoD}$) is defined as the smallest mean signal, which we will call $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$, such that the probability of a measurement from this sample exceeding the Limit of Blank ($\\text{LoB}$) is $0.95$. This condition defines the Type II error rate (rate of false negatives) to be $\\beta = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nMathematically, with the mean set to $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$, this is:\n$$ P(X_{\\text{low}}  \\text{LoB}) = 0.95 $$\nwhere $X_{\\text{low}} \\sim N(\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}, \\sigma_{\\text{low}}^2)$.\n\nTo analyze this probability, we standardize the random variable $X_{\\text{low}}$. Let $Z$ be a standard Normal random variable, $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$. The standardization is $Z = \\frac{X_{\\text{low}} - \\mu_{\\text{LoD}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{low}}}$. Applying this to the inequality:\n$$ P\\left(\\frac{X_{\\text{low}} - \\mu_{\\text{LoD}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{low}}}  \\frac{\\text{LoB} - \\mu_{\\text{LoD}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{low}}}\\right) = 0.95 $$\n$$ P\\left(Z  \\frac{\\text{LoB} - \\mu_{\\text{LoD}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{low}}}\\right) = 0.95 $$\n\nThis is an upper-tail probability. Let $\\Phi(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard Normal distribution. The relation between the upper-tail probability and the CDF is $P(Z  z) = 1 - \\Phi(z)$.\n$$ 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\text{LoB} - \\mu_{\\text{LoD}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{low}}}\\right) = 0.95 $$\n$$ \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\text{LoB} - \\mu_{\\text{LoD}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{low}}}\\right) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\n\nThis equation states that the argument of the CDF is the quantile of the standard Normal distribution corresponding to a cumulative probability of $0.05$. Let this quantile be denoted as $z_{0.05}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\text{LoB} - \\mu_{\\text{LoD}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{low}}} = z_{0.05} $$\n\nBy the symmetry of the Normal distribution, $z_{p} = -z_{1-p}$. Therefore, $z_{0.05} = -z_{0.95}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\text{LoB} - \\mu_{\\text{LoD}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{low}}} = -z_{0.95} $$\n\nWe now solve for $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$, which is the first required part of the derivation.\n$$ \\text{LoB} - \\mu_{\\text{LoD}} = -z_{0.95} \\sigma_{\\text{low}} $$\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{LoD}} = \\text{LoB} + z_{0.95} \\sigma_{\\text{low}} $$\nThis is the analytic expression for the mean signal at the Limit of Detection, $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$, in terms of $\\text{LoB}$, $\\sigma_{\\text{low}}$, and the standard Normal quantile $z_{0.95}$.\n\nNext, we compute the $\\text{LoD}$ in terms of concentration. The problem provides a linear relationship between the mean signal $S(C)$ and concentration $C$: $S(C) = S_{0} + \\alpha C$. At the LoD, the mean signal is $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$ and the concentration is $C_{\\text{LoD}}$.\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{LoD}} = S_0 + \\alpha C_{\\text{LoD}} $$\n\nSolving for $C_{\\text{LoD}}$ gives:\n$$ C_{\\text{LoD}} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\text{LoD}} - S_0}{\\alpha} $$\n\nSubstituting the derived expression for $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$:\n$$ C_{\\text{LoD}} = \\frac{(\\text{LoB} + z_{0.95} \\sigma_{\\text{low}}) - S_0}{\\alpha} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n-   $\\text{LoB} = 420$\n-   $\\sigma_{\\text{low}} = 45$\n-   $S_{0} = 350$\n-   $\\alpha = 12$\n-   The standard Normal quantile for a cumulative probability of $0.95$ is $z_{0.95} \\approx 1.64485...$, which is commonly rounded to $1.645$ in this context. We will use $z_{0.95} = 1.645$.\n\n$$ C_{\\text{LoD}} = \\frac{(420 + 1.645 \\times 45) - 350}{12} $$\n$$ C_{\\text{LoD}} = \\frac{(420 + 74.025) - 350}{12} $$\n$$ C_{\\text{LoD}} = \\frac{494.025 - 350}{12} $$\n$$ C_{\\text{LoD}} = \\frac{144.025}{12} \\approx 12.0020833... $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final concentration to four significant figures.\n$$ C_{\\text{LoD}} \\approx 12.00 \\, \\text{pg}\\,\\text{mL}^{-1} $$\n\nFinally, we evaluate the robustness of the derived expression $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}} = \\text{LoB} + z_{0.95} \\sigma_{\\text{low}}$ to deviations from the underlying assumptions.\n\n**Robustness to Deviations from Normality:**\nThe entire derivation relies on the properties of the Normal distribution, specifically the use of the quantile $z_{0.95}$ (the \"decision constant\") to relate the mean, standard deviation, and tail probability.\n-   **Skewness:** Biological and chemical measurements, such as fluorescence intensity, are often right-skewed (e.g., following a Lognormal distribution). If the distribution of low-level signals is right-skewed, its lower tail is compressed and its upper tail is extended. To achieve a state where $95\\%$ of the signal mass is above the $\\text{LoB}$, the mean $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$ would need to be substantially higher than predicted by the symmetric Normal model. The derived formula would thus underestimate the true $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$, leading to an optimistically low (i.e., seemingly better but incorrect) calculated $\\text{LoD}$.\n-   **Heavy Tails (Leptokurtosis):** If the signal distribution has heavier tails than a Normal distribution, there is more probability mass in the extremes. A heavier lower tail means that to ensure only $5\\%$ of the distribution falls below $\\text{LoB}$, the mean $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$ must be shifted further away from $\\text{LoB}$ than the $z_{0.95}\\sigma_{\\text{low}}$ term suggests. Again, the formula based on Normality would underestimate the true required mean signal and thus report an overly optimistic $\\text{LoD}$.\nIn both cases, the \"decision constant\" $z_{0.95}$ is incorrect, and non-parametric methods (based on empirical quantiles) or data transformations (e.g., logarithmic) would be more appropriate.\n\n**Robustness to Heteroscedasticity:**\nHeteroscedasticity, where the variance of the signal is not constant but depends on the mean, is a common feature of immunoassays. The variance typically increases with the signal level.\n-   The derived expression uses a single value, $\\sigma_{\\text{low}}$, for the standard deviation. This implicitly assumes that $\\sigma_{\\text{low}}$ is the correct standard deviation at the specific mean level of $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$.\n-   However, $\\sigma_{\\text{low}}$ is an *estimate* from low-level replicates, which may not have a mean of exactly $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$. If variance increases with the mean, and $\\sigma_{\\text{low}}$ was estimated from samples with a mean lower than the true $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$, then the true standard deviation at $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$ would be larger than the value used. This would cause the calculated $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}}$ to be underestimated.\n-   The conceptual impact is that the formula $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}} = \\text{LoB} + z_{0.95} \\sigma_{\\text{low}}$ becomes an implicit equation if variance is a function of the mean, i.e., $\\mu_{\\text{LoD}} = \\text{LoB} + z_{0.95} \\sigma(\\mu_{\\text{LoD}})$, which may require an iterative solution. The simple additive expression is not robust to strong heteroscedasticity, and the accuracy of the resulting $\\text{LoD}$ becomes highly sensitive to how and where $\\sigma_{\\text{low}}$ was estimated.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{12.00}\n$$", "id": "5149938"}, {"introduction": "While the LoD defines the lower boundary of an assay's performance, the upper limit of the dynamic range can be compromised by artifacts such as the Hook effect.

A one-step sandwich assay is performed by incubating the spot with a premixed solution of antigen and fluorescently labeled detection antibody. Let the antigen carry one capture epitope and one detection epitope (valency $v=1$ for each). Assume classical law-of-mass-action equilibria with the following definitions and assumptions:\n- The capture step at the surface follows a Langmuir isotherm with dissociation constant $K_{d,C}$ for the capture epitope binding to the immobilized capture antibody. The effective capture-competent antigen concentration in bulk is the total antigen concentration $A_{t}$ because both free antigen and antigen–detection antibody complex can bind the capture antibody.\n- In the bulk, antigen ($A$) and detection antibody ($D$) bind in a $1:1$ stoichiometry with dissociation constant $K_{d,D}$ according to $A + D \\rightleftharpoons AD$.

All necessary information is provided. We can proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is organized into the four tasks specified in the problem, followed by the qualitative justification.\n\n**Task 1: Derive the expression for $S(A_t)$**\n\nThe signal, $S(A_t)$, is given to be proportional to the product of the Langmuir occupancy of capture sites, $\\theta_{C}(A_{t})$, and the fraction of antigen molecules bearing a bound detection antibody in the bulk solution, $\\theta_{D}(A_{t})$. We can write this as $S(A_t) \\propto \\theta_{C}(A_{t}) \\theta_{D}(A_{t})$, where the proportionality constant is independent of the antigen concentration $A_t$.\n\nThe capture-site occupancy is given by the Langmuir isotherm, where the effective antigen concentration is the total antigen concentration $A_t$:\n$$ \\theta_{C}(A_{t}) = \\frac{A_{t}}{K_{d,C} + A_{t}} $$\nThe fraction of antigen with bound detection antibody is the ratio of the concentration of the antigen-detection antibody complex, $[AD]$, to the total antigen concentration, $A_t$:\n$$ \\theta_{D}(A_{t}) = \\frac{[AD]}{A_t} $$\nSubstituting these into the signal expression, we find that the $A_t$ terms cancel:\n$$ S(A_t) \\propto \\left( \\frac{A_t}{K_{d,C} + A_t} \\right) \\left( \\frac{[AD]}{A_t} \\right) = \\frac{[AD]}{K_{d,C} + A_t} $$\nTo obtain the final expression, we must find an explicit form for $[AD]$ in terms of $A_t$, $D_t$, and $K_{d,D}$. We start with the mass balance equations and the equilibrium condition for the bulk reaction $A + D \\rightleftharpoons AD$.\nLet $x = [AD]$.\nThe mass balances are:\n$$ A_t = [A] + [AD] \\implies [A] = A_t - x $$\n$$ D_t = [D] + [AD] \\implies [D] = D_t - x $$\nThe dissociation constant for the bulk reaction is:\n$$ K_{d,D} = \\frac{[A][D]}{[AD]} = \\frac{(A_t - x)(D_t - x)}{x} $$\nRearranging this equation gives a quadratic equation for $x$:\n$$ K_{d,D} x = A_t D_t - A_t x - D_t x + x^2 $$\n$$ x^2 - (A_t + D_t + K_{d,D})x + A_t D_t = 0 $$\nWe solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b = -(A_t + D_t + K_{d,D})$, and $c = A_t D_t$:\n$$ x = \\frac{(A_t + D_t + K_{d,D}) \\pm \\sqrt{(A_t + D_t + K_{d,D})^2 - 4A_t D_t}}{2} $$\nThe concentration of the complex, $x$, cannot exceed the total concentrations of its constituents, $A_t$ and $D_t$. The positive root would lead to a physically unrealistic solution where $x$ could be larger than $A_t$ or $D_t$. Therefore, we must choose the negative root.\n$$ [AD] = x = \\frac{(A_t + D_t + K_{d,D}) - \\sqrt{(A_t + D_t + K_{d,D})^2 - 4A_t D_t}}{2} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $[AD]$ into the signal's proportionality relation gives the final expression for $S(A_t)$:\n$$ S(A_t) \\propto \\frac{(A_t + D_t + K_{d,D}) - \\sqrt{(A_t + D_t + K_{d,D})^2 - 4A_t D_t}}{2(K_{d,C} + A_t)} $$\n\n**Task 2: Derive the expression for $A_{\\mathrm{hook}}$**\n\nTo find the antigen concentration $A_{\\mathrm{hook}}$ that maximizes $S(A_t)$, we must find the value of $A_t$ for which the derivative of $S(A_t)$ with respect to $A_t$ is zero. Let's work with the simpler form $S(A_t) \\propto f(A_t) = \\frac{[AD]}{K_{d,C} + A_t}$.\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation, we set $\\frac{df}{dA_t} = 0$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dA_t}\\left( \\frac{[AD]}{K_{d,C} + A_t} \\right) = \\frac{(K_{d,C} + A_t)\\frac{d[AD]}{dA_t} - [AD]\\frac{d}{dA_t}(K_{d,C} + A_t)}{(K_{d,C} + A_t)^2} = 0 $$\nThis simplifies to the condition (for $A_t  0$):\n$$ (K_{d,C} + A_t)\\frac{d[AD]}{dA_t} - [AD] = 0 $$\nTo find $\\frac{d[AD]}{dA_t}$, we differentiate the equilibrium relation $K_{d,D} [AD] = [A][D]$ implicitly with respect to $A_t$. Recalling $[A] = A_t - [AD]$ and $[D] = D_t - [AD]$, we have $d[A] = dA_t - d[AD]$ and $d[D] = -d[AD]$ since $D_t$ is constant.\n$$ K_{d,D} d[AD] = [A]d[D] + [D]d[A] $$\n$$ K_{d,D} d[AD] = [A](-d[AD]) + [D](dA_t - d[AD]) $$\n$$ (K_{d,D} + [A] + [D])d[AD] = [D]dA_t $$\n$$ \\frac{d[AD]}{dA_t} = \\frac{[D]}{[A] + [D] + K_{d,D}} $$\nSubstituting this into our maximization condition:\n$$ (K_{d,C} + A_t)\\left(\\frac{[D]}{[A] + [D] + K_{d,D}}\\right) - [AD] = 0 $$\n$$ (K_{d,C} + A_t)[D] = [AD]([A] + [D] + K_{d,D}) $$\nLet $A_t=A_{\\mathrm{hook}}$ and $x=[AD]$ at this point.

A more direct path is to combine the maximization condition with the equilibrium condition in a simplified form. The maximization condition and the equilibrium condition must hold simultaneously. This leads to a simplified system of two quadratic equations for $x$ and $A_{\\mathrm{hook}}$:\n1. $x^2 - (A_{\\mathrm{hook}} + K_{d,C})x + K_{d,C}D_t = 0$\n2. $x^2 - (A_{\\mathrm{hook}} + D_t + K_{d,D})x + A_{\\mathrm{hook}} D_t = 0$\nSubtracting the first equation from the second yields:\n$$ x(-D_t - K_{d,D} + K_{d,C}) + A_{\\mathrm{hook}} D_t - K_{d,C}D_t = 0 $$\n$$ x(K_{d,C} - D_t - K_{d,D}) = -D_t(A_{\\mathrm{hook}} - K_{d,C}) \\implies x = \\frac{D_t(A_{\\mathrm{hook}} - K_{d,C})}{D_t + K_{d,D} - K_{d,C}} $$\nSubstituting this $x$ into the first equation, $x^2 - (A_{\\mathrm{hook}}+K_{d,C})x + K_{d,C}D_t = 0$, and solving for $A_{\\mathrm{hook}}$ is algebraically intensive. A more streamlined approach is to solve for $x$ in terms of the system parameters. From the two-equation system, we can eliminate $A_{\\mathrm{hook}}$ to obtain a quadratic equation for $x$:\n$$ (K_{d,D} - K_{d,C})x^2 + 2K_{d,C}D_t x - K_{d,C}D_t^2 = 0 $$\nSolving for $x$ (and taking the physically meaningful positive root) yields:\n$$ x = \\frac{D_t \\sqrt{K_{d,C}}}{\\sqrt{K_{d,C}} + \\sqrt{K_{d,D}}} $$\nThis is the concentration of the complex $[AD]$ when the signal is maximal.

The signal decrease at high antigen concentrations (the Hook effect) is caused by the depletion of the fluorescently labeled detection antibody $D$ in the bulk solution. At extremely high $A_t$, most detection antibody molecules form $AD$ complexes, but only a small fraction of the total antigen can bind to the limited surface capture sites. The fraction of antigen molecules that carry a label, $\\theta_D = [AD]/A_t$, decreases as approximately $D_t/A_t$ for $A_t \\gg D_t$, causing the overall signal to fall.\n\nIn a two-step assay, the process is separated. First, the surface is incubated with the antigen-containing sample. The surface captures antigen in a quantity proportional to $\\theta_C(A_t) = \\frac{A_t}{K_{d,C} + A_t}$. Unbound antigen is then washed away. Subsequently, the surface is incubated with a fresh solution of detection antibody at concentration $D_t$. The detection antibody binds to the already-captured antigen. The signal is proportional to the amount of captured antigen multiplied by a constant factor related to the detection antibody binding, which does not depend on the initial $A_t$. The signal is therefore $S_{2-step} \\propto \\theta_C(A_t)$. This function, $\\theta_C(A_t)$, is monotonically increasing with $A_t$ and saturates at high concentrations. It does not exhibit a peak or subsequent decrease. Thus, the two-step format eliminates the solution-phase competition that causes the Hook effect in the one-step format.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{229} $$", "id": "5149976"}, {"introduction": "The integrity of microarray data depends not only on the assay chemistry but also on correcting for technical artifacts inherent to the physical slide format.

Given the target coordinate $(x_0,y_0) = (0,0)$, the objective function is:\n$$\nQ(a,b,c) = \\sum_{i} w_i \\left(L_i - a - b x_i - c y_i\\right)^2\n$$\nTo minimize $Q$, we take the partial derivatives with respect to $a$, $b$, and $c$, and set them to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial a} = \\sum_{i} 2 w_i (L_i - a - b x_i - c y_i)(-1) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial b} = \\sum_{i} 2 w_i (L_i - a - b x_i - c y_i)(-x_i) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial c} = \\sum_{i} 2 w_i (L_i - a - b x_i - c y_i)(-y_i) = 0\n$$\nDividing by $-2$ and rearranging the terms, we obtain the normal equations:\n1.  $a\\left(\\sum_i w_i\\right) + b\\left(\\sum_i w_i x_i\\right) + c\\left(\\sum_i w_i y_i\\right) = \\sum_i w_i L_i$\n2.  $a\\left(\\sum_i w_i x_i\\right) + b\\left(\\sum_i w_i x_i^2\\right) + c\\left(\\sum_i w_i x_i y_i\\right) = \\sum_i w_i x_i L_i$\n3.  $a\\left(\\sum_i w_i y_i\\right) + b\\left(\\sum_i w_i x_i y_i\\right) + c\\left(\\sum_i w_i y_i^2\\right) = \\sum_i w_i y_i L_i$\n\nThe given neighborhood of points is symmetric about the origin $(0,0)$. The coordinates are $(0,0)$, $(\\pm 1, 0)$, $(0, \\pm 1)$, and $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1)$. The Euclidean distance $d_i = \\sqrt{x_i^2 + y_i^2}$ depends only on the magnitudes of $x_i$ and $y_i$. Consequently, the weights $w_i = K(d_i/h)$ are also symmetric, i.e., $w(x_i, y_i) = w(-x_i, y_i) = w(x_i, -y_i) = w(-x_i, -y_i)$.\n\nDue to this symmetry, several sums in the normal equations vanish:\n- $\\sum_i w_i x_i = 0$: For every point $(x,y)$ with weight $w$, there is a point $(-x,y)$ with the same weight, so their contributions $wx$ and $w(-x)$ cancel. The sum over all pairs is zero.\n- $\\sum_i w_i y_i = 0$: By the same logic for the $y$-coordinate.\n- $\\sum_i w_i x_i y_i = 0$: For every group of four points $(\\pm x, \\pm y)$ with the same weight $w$, the sum of their contributions is $w(xy) + w(-xy) + w(x(-y)) + w((-x)(-y)) = w(xy - xy - xy + xy) = 0$. The sum over the entire symmetric set is zero.\n\nSubstituting these zero-valued sums into the normal equations simplifies the system significantly:\n1.  $a\\left(\\sum_i w_i\\right) + b(0) + c(0) = \\sum_i w_i L_i$\n2.  $a(0) + b\\left(\\sum_i w_i x_i^2\\right) + c(0) = \\sum_i w_i x_i L_i$\n3.  $a(0) + b(0) + c\\left(\\sum_i w_i y_i^2\\right) = \\sum_i w_i y_i L_i$\n\nFrom the first simplified equation, we can directly solve for $\\widehat{a}$:\n$$\n\\widehat{a} = \\frac{\\sum_i w_i L_i}{\\sum_i w_i}\n$$\nThe estimated bias at the origin, $\\widehat{B}(0,0) = \\widehat{a}$, is simply the weighted average of the observed log-intensities $L_i$ in the neighborhood.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of the Normalized Log-Intensity\nWe compute the weights $w_i$ for each of the nine points using $h=2$ and $w_i = 1 - (d_i/h)^2$.\nThe points can be grouped by their distance from the origin $(0,0)$.\n\n- **Group 1**: Point $(0,0)$\n  - $d_0 = \\sqrt{0^2+0^2} = 0$.\n  - $u_0 = d_0/h = 0/2 = 0$.\n  - $w_0 = 1 - 0^2 = 1$.\n\n- **Group 2**: Points $(\\pm 1, 0)$ and $(0, \\pm 1)$ ($4$ points total).\n  - $d = \\sqrt{1^2+0^2} = 1$.\n  - $u = d/h = 1/2 = 0.5$.\n  - $w = 1 - (0.5)^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n\n- **Group 3**: Points $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1)$ ($4$ points total).\n  - $d = \\sqrt{1^2+1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\n  - $u = d/h = \\sqrt{2}/2$. Since $u^2 = 2/4 = 0.5  1$, these points are within the kernel's support.\n  - $w = 1 - (\\sqrt{2}/2)^2 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$.\n\nNow we calculate the terms required for $\\widehat{a}$.\nThe sum of weights is:\n$$\n\\sum_i w_i = w_0 + 4 \\times w_{\\text{Group 2}} + 4 \\times w_{\\text{Group 3}} = 1 + 4(0.75) + 4(0.5) = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6\n$$\nThe weighted sum of log-intensities is:\n$$\n\\sum_i w_i L_i = w_0 L_0 + w_{\\text{Group 2}} \\sum_{i \\in \\text{Group 2}} L_i + w_{\\text{Group 3}} \\sum_{i \\in \\text{Group 3}} L_i\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_i w_i L_i = 1(12.40) + 0.75(12.80 + 12.90 + 12.60 + 12.70) + 0.5(13.00 + 12.95 + 12.85 + 12.90)\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_i w_i L_i = 12.40 + 0.75(51.0) + 0.5(51.7)\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_i w_i L_i = 12.40 + 38.25 + 25.85 = 76.5\n$$\nThe estimated bias at the origin is:\n$$\n\\widehat{B}(0,0) = \\widehat{a} = \\frac{\\sum_i w_i L_i}{\\sum_i w_i} = \\frac{76.5}{6} = 12.75\n$$\nFinally, we compute the normalized log-intensity for the target spot at $(0,0)$:\n$$\nL_0^{\\mathrm{norm}} = L_0 - \\widehat{B}(0,0) = 12.40 - 12.75 = -0.35\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $-0.3500$.\n\n### Part 3: Assumptions of a Local Regression-Based Spatial Normalization\nThe effectiveness of this normalization method relies on several key assumptions:\n\n1.  **Smoothness of the Bias Field**: The primary assumption is that the spatial bias field $B(x,y)$ is a smooth, low-frequency function of the spatial coordinates. This means that $B(x,y)$ does not change abruptly between neighboring spots and can be accurately approximated by a low-order polynomial (in this case, a plane) within a local neighborhood defined by the bandwidth $h$. Technical artifacts like print-tip effects or hybridization gradients generally satisfy this condition.\n\n2.  **Stochastic Independence of True Signal and Position**: It is critically assumed that the true biological log-signals $S_i$ are not systematically correlated with spatial position in a manner that would be confounded with the bias field. In this local context, it is assumed that the `S_i` values within the neighborhood behave like random variables with a constant mean. If the true signals themselves exhibited a linear trend within the neighborhood, the local regression would incorrectly identify this trend as part of the bias $B(x,y)$ and remove it, thereby distorting the biological data. This assumption is often justified by the (presumed) random spatial assignment of different biological probes across the microarray surface.\n\n3.  **Correctness of the Additive Model**: The method assumes that after a base-$2$ logarithmic transformation, the observed intensity is a sum of the true signal, the spatial bias, and a noise term: $L_i = S_i + B(x,y) + \\varepsilon_i$. This implies that in the original intensity scale, the bias was multiplicative ($I_{\\text{obs}} = I_{\\text{true}} \\cdot I_{\\text{bias}} \\cdot \\exp(\\varepsilon)$), which is a widely accepted model for many sources of systematic variation in microarray experiments. It also assumes the noise term $\\varepsilon_i$ has a mean of zero and is independent of the signal and bias.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the local weighted least-squares fit effectively captures the low-frequency trend attributable to the spatial bias $B(x,y)$, while averaging over the high-frequency, \"random\" variations of the true signals $S_i$ and noise $\\varepsilon_i$. Subtracting the estimated bias $\\widehat{B}(x_0, y_0)$ from the observed value $L_0$ thus removes the technical artifact without systematically altering the underlying biological signal.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.3500}\n$$", "id": "5149926"}]}
