It is a standard, formalizable problem in the field of optical biosensors.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the decadic absorbance, $A$, using the Beer–Lambert law:\n$$A = \\epsilon c l$$\nThe concentration must be converted to the standard unit of Molarity ($\\mathrm{M}$).\n$c = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 10 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M} = 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$A = (5 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) \\times (10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{M}) \\times (0.1\\,\\mathrm{cm})$$\n$$A = 5 \\times 10^{4} \\times 10^{-8} \\times 10^{-1} = 5 \\times 10^{4-8-1} = 5 \\times 10^{-5}$$\nThe absorbance is a dimensionless quantity. $A = 5 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nNext, we determine the fraction of incident photons that are absorbed. The decadic absorbance $A$ is defined in terms of the incident intensity, $I_0$, and the transmitted intensity, $I_t$, as:\n$$A = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I_t}\\right)$$\nRearranging this definition gives the transmittance, $T$, which is the fraction of photons transmitted:\n$$T = \\frac{I_t}{I_0} = 10^{-A}$$\nThe fraction of photons absorbed, $F_{abs}$, is the remainder:\n$$F_{abs, exact} = 1 - T = 1 - 10^{-A}$$\nThis is the exact expression for the fraction of absorbed photons.\n\nFor the first-order linearization, we consider the case where absorbance is very small ($A \\ll 1$). We can express the function $f(A) = 10^{-A}$ as $f(A) = \\exp(-A \\ln(10))$. The Taylor series expansion of $\\exp(-x)$ around $x=0$ is $1 - x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\dots$.\nFor a first-order approximation, we take the first two terms with $x = A \\ln(10)$:\n$$10^{-A} = \\exp(-A \\ln(10)) \\approx 1 - A \\ln(10)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the absorbed fraction gives the linearized version, $F_{abs, lin}$:\n$$F_{abs, lin} = 1 - (1 - A \\ln(10)) = A \\ln(10)$$\n\nThe problem states that the detected fluorescence signal is proportional to the number of absorbed photons multiplied by the fluorescence quantum yield, $\\Phi$. If we normalize this signal to the incident photon flux, the proportional fluorescence signal, $S$, is simply the fraction of absorbed photons multiplied by the quantum yield.\nThe exact proportional fluorescence signal, $S_{exact}$, is:\n$$S_{exact} = F_{abs, exact} \\times \\Phi = (1 - 10^{-A}) \\Phi$$\nThe first-order linearized proportional fluorescence signal, $S_{lin}$, is:\n$$S_{lin} = F_{abs, lin} \\times \\Phi = (A \\ln(10)) \\Phi$$\n\nTo discuss whether the linearization is justified, we can compute the relative error introduced by the approximation. The relative error is given by $\\frac{|S_{lin} - S_{exact}|}{S_{exact}}$. A simpler way to assess the justification is to look at the magnitude of the next term in the Taylor expansion relative to the first-order term. The approximation error is dominated by the second-order term of the expansion of $1-\\exp(-A\\ln(10))$, which is $-\\frac{(A\\ln(10))^2}{2}$. The first-order term is $A\\ln(10)$. The fractional error is approximately:\n$$\\text{Error} \\approx \\frac{\\left|-\\frac{(A\\ln(10))^2}{2}\\right|}{A\\ln(10)} = \\frac{A\\ln(10)}{2}$$\nWith $A = 5 \\times 10^{-5}$, the approximate relative error is:\n$$\\text{Error} \\approx \\frac{(5 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times \\ln(10)}{2} \\approx \\frac{(5 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 2.3026}{2} \\approx 5.756 \\times 10^{-5}$$\nThis corresponds to an error of approximately $0.0058\\%$. Such a small deviation is negligible for almost all practical measurement purposes, thus the linearization is highly justified for the given parameters.\n\nFinally, we must compute the ratio of the exact proportional fluorescence signal to its first-order linearized counterpart, $\\frac{S_{exact}}{S_{lin}}$. The quantum yield $\\Phi$ cancels out.\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{S_{exact}}{S_{lin}} = \\frac{(1 - 10^{-A})\\Phi}{(A \\ln(10))\\Phi} = \\frac{1 - 10^{-A}}{A \\ln(10)}$$\nSubstituting $A = 5 \\times 10^{-5}$:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{1 - 10^{-5 \\times 10^{-5}}}{(5 \\times 10^{-5}) \\ln(10)}$$\nUsing a high-precision calculator:\nThe denominator is $(5 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times \\ln(10) \\approx 5 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 2.30258509299 \\approx 0.00011512925465$.\nThe numerator is $1 - 10^{-0.00005} \\approx 1 - 0.999884877372 \\approx 0.000115122628$.\n$$\\text{Ratio} \\approx \\frac{0.000115122628}{0.00011512925465} \\approx 0.9999424853$$\nRounding to six significant figures, the ratio is $0.999942$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.999942}\n$$", "id": "5144576"}, {"introduction": "Beyond signal generation, a key task in diagnostics is to rigorously define a sensor's performance limits.

I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the derivation of the Damköhler number ($\\text{Da}$) by comparing the capacities of surface reaction and mass transport, followed by a numerical calculation.\n\n**1. Mass Transport Flux and Coefficient**\n\nAccording to Fick's first law, the diffusive flux of the analyte, $J_{\\text{transport}}$, towards the surface (in the $z$-direction, normal to the surface) is given by:\n$$J_{\\text{transport}} = -D \\frac{dc}{dz}$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $\\frac{dc}{dz}$ is the concentration gradient.\n\nThe film theory approximates this gradient as linear across a stagnant boundary layer of thickness $\\delta$. The concentration changes from the bulk concentration $c_b$ at $z=\\delta$ to the surface concentration $c_s$ at $z=0$. The gradient is thus:\n$$\\frac{dc}{dz} \\approx \\frac{c_s - c_b}{\\delta}$$\nThe flux *towards* the surface is therefore:\n$$J_{\\text{transport}} = -D \\left( \\frac{c_s - c_b}{\\delta} \\right) = \\frac{D}{\\delta} (c_b - c_s)$$\nThe mass transport flux is also defined in terms of a mass transfer coefficient, $k_m$, as:\n$$J_{\\text{transport}} = k_m (c_b - c_s)$$\nBy comparing the two expressions for $J_{\\text{transport}}$, we identify the mass transfer coefficient as:\n$$k_m = \\frac{D}{\\delta}$$\nThis completes the first part of the task. The term $k_m$ has units of velocity (e.g., m s$^{-1}$) and represents the characteristic speed of mass transport.\n\n**2. Surface Reaction Flux**\n\nThe rate of binding at the surface is described by the law of mass action. The rate of change of the surface concentration of bound analyte, $\\Gamma$ (in mol m$^{-2}$), is the net result of association and dissociation.\n$$\\frac{d\\Gamma}{dt} = k_a c_s (R - \\Gamma) - k_d \\Gamma$$\nHere, $R$ is the total areal density of binding sites, $\\Gamma$ is the density of occupied sites, $(R-\\Gamma)$ is the density of available sites, $c_s$ is the analyte concentration at the surface, $k_a$ is the association rate constant, and $k_d$ is the dissociation rate constant. The term $\\frac{d\\Gamma}{dt}$ represents the net reaction flux, $J_{\\text{reaction}}$.\n\nThe problem specifies early-time conditions, where the fractional occupancy $\\frac{\\Gamma}{R}$ is small. This implies that $\\Gamma \\ll R$, so $(R - \\Gamma) \\approx R$. Furthermore, for initial rate analysis, the dissociation term $k_d \\Gamma$ is negligible compared to the association term. The reaction flux simplifies to:\n$$J_{\\text{reaction}} \\approx k_a c_s R$$\n\n**3. Damköhler Number ($\\text{Da}$)**\n\nThe Damköhler number is a dimensionless quantity that compares the rate of reaction to the rate of transport. As per the problem description, we form a ratio of the \"intrinsic surface reaction capacity\" to the \"mass transport capacity\".\n\n- The **mass transport capacity** can be characterized by the mass transfer coefficient $k_m$, which has units of velocity (m s$^{-1}$).\n- The **intrinsic surface reaction capacity** can be characterized by the term $k_a R$. Let's check its units. Converting $k_a$ to SI base units requires using $1$ M $= 10^3$ mol m$^{-3}$. So, the units of $k_a$ are (m$^3$ mol$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$). The units of $R$ are (mol m$^{-2}$). The product $k_a R$ has units of (m$^3$ mol$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$) $\\times$ (mol m$^{-2}$) = m s$^{-1}$.\n\nSince both $k_m$ and $k_a R$ have units of velocity, their ratio is a dimensionless number that directly compares the characteristic speed of the reaction process to the characteristic speed of the transport process. This ratio is the Damköhler number for this system:\n$$\\text{Da} = \\frac{\\text{Intrinsic Surface Reaction Capacity}}{\\text{Mass Transport Capacity}} = \\frac{k_a R}{k_m}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $k_m$:\n$$\\text{Da} = \\frac{k_a R}{D / \\delta} = \\frac{k_a R \\delta}{D}$$\nThis expression for $\\text{Da}$ is in terms of the required parameters $k_a$, $R$, $\\delta$, and $D$.\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe must first convert all parameters to a coherent system of SI units (meters, kilograms, seconds, moles).\n- $k_a = 10^5 \\text{ M}^{-1} \\text{ s}^{-1} = 10^5 \\text{ (mol L}^{-1})^{-1} \\text{ s}^{-1} = 10^5 \\text{ L mol}^{-1} \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n  Using $1$ L $= 10^{-3}$ m$^3$:\n  $k_a = 10^5 \\times (10^{-3} \\text{ m}^3) \\text{ mol}^{-1} \\text{ s}^{-1} = 100 \\text{ m}^3 \\text{ mol}^{-1} \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n- $R = 1 \\text{ pmol m}^{-2}$.\n  Using $1$ pmol $= 10^{-12}$ mol:\n  $R = 1 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ mol m}^{-2}$.\n- $\\delta = 100 \\text{ } \\mu \\text{m}$.\n  Using $1 \\text{ } \\mu \\text{m} = 10^{-6}$ m:\n  $\\delta = 100 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m} = 10^{-4} \\text{ m}$.\n- $D = 10^{-10} \\text{ m}^2 \\text{ s}^{-1}$ (already in SI units).\n\nNow, substitute these values into the expression for $\\text{Da}$:\n$$\\text{Da} = \\frac{k_a R \\delta}{D} = \\frac{(100 \\text{ m}^3 \\text{ mol}^{-1} \\text{ s}^{-1}) \\times (10^{-12} \\text{ mol m}^{-2}) \\times (10^{-4} \\text{ m})}{10^{-10} \\text{ m}^2 \\text{ s}^{-1}}$$\n$$\\text{Da} = \\frac{10^2 \\times 10^{-12} \\times 10^{-4}}{10^{-10}} = \\frac{10^{2-12-4}}{10^{-10}} = \\frac{10^{-14}}{10^{-10}} = 10^{-14 - (-10)} = 10^{-4}$$\nThe value of the Damköhler number is $10^{-4}$, or $0.0001$. Rounded to four significant figures, this is $1.000 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n\n**5. Interpretation of the Result**\n\nThe Damköhler number, $\\text{Da} = \\frac{k_a R}{k_m}$, compares the rate of reaction to the rate of mass transport.\n- If $\\text{Da} \\gg 1$, the reaction is much faster than transport. The overall rate is limited by how quickly the analyte can be transported to the surface. This is a **transport-limited** regime.\n- If $\\text{Da} \\ll 1$, the transport is much faster than the reaction. Analyte is readily available at the surface, but the reaction itself is slow. The overall rate is limited by the intrinsic kinetics of the binding reaction. This is a **reaction-limited** regime.\n\nIn this case, $\\text{Da} = 1.000 \\times 10^{-4}$. Since $\\text{Da} \\ll 1$, the biosensor response dynamics are strongly **reaction-limited** under the given conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.000 \\times 10^{-4}}$$", "id": "5144590"}]}
