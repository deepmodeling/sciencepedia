The readout is the fraction of cells that become infected after a single round of infection. The assay is designed such that the number of infectious virions attaching/entering any given cell is an independent random variable, and the multiplicity of infection (MOI) is controlled by the inoculum. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) is defined as the average number of infectious virions delivered per target cell and is denoted by $\\mu$. Assume independent virion entry events with no cooperativity, such that the number of virions infecting a given cell is well approximated by a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu$. Let $p$ denote the probability that any given virion is rendered non-infectious by the antibody during the incubation step, and assume that neutralization acts independently on each virion and that surviving virions retain full infectivity.\n\nDefine the percent neutralization $N$ as $100$ times one minus the ratio of the infected fraction with antibody to the infected fraction without antibody, using the same $\\mu$ in both conditions. From first principles, starting with the Poisson model of infection and the independence of neutralization events, derive the expected functional dependence of $N$ on $\\mu$ and $p$, and analyze how varying $\\mu$ affects the dynamic range and interpretability of $N$ across the full span $p \\in [0, 1]$.

It provides a standard framework for modeling a viral neutralization assay using a Poisson distribution for infection events, which is a common and valid approach in virology. All necessary parameters and assumptions are clearly defined. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nWe begin by deriving the functional form of the percent neutralization, $N$, from first principles.\n\nLet $k$ be the number of virions infecting a single cell. The problem states that $k$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu$, the multiplicity of infection (MOI). The probability mass function is $P(k; \\mu) = \\frac{e^{-\\mu}\\mu^k}{k!}$.\n\nA cell is considered infected if it is infected by one or more virions, i.e., $k \\geq 1$. It is easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event: a cell is *not* infected, which corresponds to $k=0$.\n$$ P(k=0; \\mu) = \\frac{e^{-\\mu}\\mu^0}{0!} = e^{-\\mu} $$\nThe fraction of infected cells, denoted by $I$, is the probability that a cell is infected by at least one virion:\n$$ I = P(k \\geq 1; \\mu) = 1 - P(k=0; \\mu) = 1 - e^{-\\mu} $$\n\nFirst, consider the case without antibody. The fraction of infected cells, $I_{no-ab}$, is directly given by the above formula with the specified MOI, $\\mu$:\n$$ I_{no-ab} = 1 - e^{-\\mu} $$\n\nNext, consider the case with antibody. The antibody renders any given virion non-infectious with probability $p$. This means a virion remains infectious with probability $(1-p)$. Since neutralization acts independently on each virion, the effect on the overall population of virions is to reduce the average number of infectious virions per cell. The new, effective MOI, which we denote as $\\mu'$, is the original MOI scaled by the probability of a virion surviving neutralization:\n$$ \\mu' = \\mu (1-p) $$\nThe fraction of infected cells in the presence of the antibody, $I_{ab}$, is therefore given by the same infection formula but using the effective MOI, $\\mu'$:\n$$ I_{ab} = 1 - e^{-\\mu'} = 1 - e^{-\\mu(1-p)} $$\n\nThe percent neutralization $N$ is defined as $100$ times one minus the ratio of the infected fraction with antibody to the infected fraction without antibody:\n$$ N = 100 \\left( 1 - \\frac{I_{ab}}{I_{no-ab}} \\right) $$\nSubstituting our derived expressions for $I_{ab}$ and $I_{no-ab}$:\n$$ N(\\mu, p) = 100 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1 - e^{-\\mu(1-p)}}{1 - e^{-\\mu}} \\right) $$\nThis is the expected functional dependence of $N$ on $\\mu$ and $p$.\n\nNow, we analyze the behavior of $N$ in limiting regimes of $\\mu$.\n\nLimit for low MOI ($\\mu \\to 0$):\nFor small $x$, the Taylor expansion of $e^{-x}$ is $e^{-x} \\approx 1 - x$. Applying this to the numerator and denominator of the fraction within the formula for $N$:\n$$ 1 - e^{-\\mu(1-p)} \\approx 1 - (1 - \\mu(1-p)) = \\mu(1-p) $$\n$$ 1 - e^{-\\mu} \\approx 1 - (1 - \\mu) = \\mu $$\nSubstituting these approximations into the expression for $N$:\n$$ N \\approx 100 \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\mu(1-p)}{\\mu} \\right) = 100 \\left( 1 - (1-p) \\right) = 100p $$\nIn the low-$\\mu$ limit, the measured percent neutralization $N$ becomes a direct, linear measure of the underlying probability of virion neutralization $p$. This provides a full dynamic range ($p \\in [0, 1] \\implies N \\in [0, 100]$) and straightforward interpretability.\n\nLimit for high MOI ($\\mu \\to \\infty$):\nAs $\\mu \\to \\infty$, $e^{-\\mu} \\to 0$. Therefore, the denominator $1 - e^{-\\mu} \\to 1$.\nFor the numerator, if $p < 1$, then $(1-p) > 0$, and the exponent $-\\mu(1-p) \\to -\\infty$. Thus, $e^{-\\mu(1-p)} \\to 0$, and the numerator $1 - e^{-\\mu(1-p)} \\to 1$.\nThe ratio inside the parentheses approaches $\\frac{1}{1} = 1$.\n$$ N \\to 100 (1 - 1) = 0 \\quad (\\text{for } p < 1) $$\nIn the high-$\\mu$ limit, nearly all cells are infected regardless of the presence of a partially neutralizing antibody. The readout $N$ approaches $0$, meaning the assay loses its ability to distinguish different levels of neutralization (e.g., $p=0.5$ vs $p=0.9$). The dynamic range collapses.\n\nFinally, we compute the expected $N$ for $p = 0.5$ at $\\mu = 0.1$, $\\mu = 1$, and $\\mu = 10$.\nThe formula is $N = 100 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1 - e^{-0.5\\mu}}{1 - e^{-\\mu}} \\right)$.\n\nFor $\\mu = 0.1$:\n$N = 100 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1 - e^{-0.05}}{1 - e^{-0.1}} \\right) = 100 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1 - 0.951229}{1 - 0.904837} \\right) = 100 \\left( 1 - \\frac{0.048771}{0.095163} \\right) \\approx 100(1 - 0.5125) = 48.75\\%$.\n\nFor $\\mu = 1$:\n$N = 100 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1 - e^{-0.5}}{1 - e^{-1}} \\right) = 100 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1 - 0.606531}{1 - 0.367879} \\right) = 100 \\left( 1 - \\frac{0.393469}{0.632121} \\right) \\approx 100(1 - 0.6225) = 37.75\\%$.\n\nFor $\\mu = 10$:\n$N = 100 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1 - e^{-5}}{1 - e^{-10}} \\right) = 100 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1 - 0.006738}{1 - 0.000045} \\right) = 100 \\left( 1 - \\frac{0.993262}{0.999955} \\right) \\approx 100(1 - 0.9933) = 0.67\\%$.\n\nThese calculations confirm that for a fixed level of neutralization $p$, the measured percent neutralization $N$ decreases as $\\mu$ increases. The assay's sensitivity and dynamic range are highest at low $\\mu$ and collapse at high $\\mu$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\nA. Under the independent-action Poisson model, the infected fraction without antibody is $1 - e^{-\\mu}$ and with antibody is $1 - e^{-\\mu(1 - p)}$, giving $N = 100 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1 - e^{-\\mu(1 - p)}}{1 - e^{-\\mu}} \\right)$. In the low-$\\mu$ limit, $N \\approx 100 p$. As $\\mu$ increases, sensitivity collapses; for $p = 0.5$, $N$ is approximately $49\\%$ at $\\mu = 0.1$, $38\\%$ at $\\mu = 1$, and $0.67\\%$ at $\\mu = 10$. Therefore, dynamic range and interpretability are maximized at low-to-moderate $\\mu$, not at very high $\\mu$.\nThis option correctly states the derived formula for $N$. It correctly identifies the low-$\\mu$ limit. Its numerical calculations ($49\\%$, $38\\%$, $0.67\\%$) are accurate roundings of my derived values ($48.75\\%$, $37.75\\%$, $0.67\\%$). Its conclusion that sensitivity collapses and that dynamic range is maximized at low-to-moderate $\\mu$ is fully supported by the analysis.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Percent neutralization equals $100 p$ for all $\\mu$ because neutralization rescales the infection rate linearly, so dynamic range is independent of $\\mu$.\nThis is incorrect. The relationship $N = 100p$ is an approximation valid only for $\\mu \\to 0$. Our derived formula for $N$ clearly shows a dependence on $\\mu$. The numerical calculations for $p=0.5$ give different values of $N$ for different $\\mu$, disproving the claim. Dynamic range is strongly dependent on $\\mu$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Increasing $\\mu$ monotonically increases the sensitivity of percent neutralization to changes in $p$ (i.e., increases $\\frac{dN}{dp}$), because more infection events per cell provide a stronger signal, expanding dynamic range.\nThis is incorrect. The analysis of the limits showed that sensitivity to $p$ (and thus dynamic range) is greatest at low $\\mu$ and collapses at high $\\mu$. The intuitive reason is that at high $\\mu$, the system saturates: almost all cells are infected even with a partially effective antibody, making it hard to measure the antibody's effect. The derivative $\\frac{dN}{dp} = \\frac{100 \\mu e^{-\\mu(1-p)}}{1 - e^{-\\mu}}$ approaches $100$ as $\\mu \\to 0$ and approaches $0$ as $\\mu \\to \\infty$. Thus, sensitivity decreases with increasing $\\mu$ (for large $\\mu$).\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. In the high-$\\mu$ limit, percent neutralization approaches $100 p$ since the denominator approaches $1$, thus large $\\mu$ expands dynamic range and simplifies interpretability.\nThis is incorrect. The premise that the denominator $1-e^{-\\mu}$ approaches $1$ is correct, but it ignores that the numerator $1-e^{-\\mu(1-p)}$ also approaches $1$ (for $p<1$), causing the ratio to approach $1$ and $N$ to approach $0$. Our limit analysis for $\\mu \\to \\infty$ shows $N \\to 0$, not $100p$. Consequently, dynamic range collapses, it does not expand.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5091378"}, {"introduction": "Once an assay protocol is designed, its robustness and suitability for screening must be rigorously validated.

Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation and calculation of a dimensionless statistic that quantifies assay quality. This statistic is known in HTS as the Z'-factor (pronounced Z-prime factor). Its derivation begins with the concept of separating the signal distributions of the positive and negative controls.\n\nLet the negative control (NC) population be described by a normal distribution with mean $\\mu_{NC}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{NC}$. Let the positive control (PC) population be described by a normal distribution with mean $\\mu_{PC}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{PC}$.

The separation between the two distributions is critically defined by the gap between the lower edge of the NC distribution and the upper edge of the PC distribution.

It asks the user to follow a specified, simplified data analysis procedure, which is a common pedagogical exercise.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will now be derived according to the specified procedure.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\n**1. Calculate Mean Neutralization and Identify Bracketing Dilutions**\n\nWe first calculate the mean percent neutralization for each dilution to find the pair that brackets the target of $y=50\\%$.\n\n-   Dilution $1{:}360$: $\\bar{y}_1 = \\frac{61 + 58 + 63}{3} = \\frac{182}{3} \\approx 60.67\\%$.\n-   Dilution $1{:}1080$: $\\bar{y}_2 = \\frac{42 + 45 + 39}{3} = \\frac{126}{3} = 42.00\\%$.\n\nSince $\\bar{y}_1 > 50\\%$ and $\\bar{y}_2 < 50\\%$, the bracketing dilutions are $1{:}360$ and $1{:}1080$.\n\n**2. Define Coordinates for Linear Interpolation**\n\nThe interpolation is performed in semilog space. Let $d$ be the reciprocal dilution. The coordinates are $(x, y) = (\\log_{10}(d), \\text{percent neutralization})$.\n\n-   Point 1: $d_1 = 360$, $x_1 = \\log_{10}(360)$, $\\bar{y}_1 = 182/3$.\n-   Point 2: $d_2 = 1080$, $x_2 = \\log_{10}(1080)$, $\\bar{y}_2 = 42$.\n\nNote that $x_2 - x_1 = \\log_{10}(1080) - \\log_{10}(360) = \\log_{10}(1080/360) = \\log_{10}(3)$.\n\n**3. Interpolate to Find the NT50 Point Estimate**\n\nWe seek $x_{50}$ such that $y=50$. Using the formula for linear interpolation:\n$$ x_{50} = x_1 + (y_{\\text{target}} - \\bar{y}_1) \\frac{x_2 - x_1}{\\bar{y}_2 - \\bar{y}_1} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ x_{50} = \\log_{10}(360) + (50 - \\frac{182}{3}) \\frac{\\log_{10}(3)}{42 - \\frac{182}{3}} $$\n$$ x_{50} = \\log_{10}(360) + \\left(\\frac{150-182}{3}\\right) \\frac{\\log_{10}(3)}{\\frac{126-182}{3}} = \\log_{10}(360) + \\left(\\frac{-32/3}{-56/3}\\right) \\log_{10}(3) $$\n$$ x_{50} = \\log_{10}(360) + \\frac{32}{56} \\log_{10}(3) = \\log_{10}(360) + \\frac{4}{7} \\log_{10}(3) $$\nNumerically:\n$$ x_{50} \\approx 2.556303 + \\frac{4}{7} (0.477121) \\approx 2.556303 + 0.272641 \\approx 2.828944 $$\nThis value is $\\log_{10}(\\text{NT50})$. The NT50 is the reciprocal dilution:\n$$ \\text{NT50} = 10^{x_{50}} = 10^{2.828944} \\approx 674.43 $$\nThis point estimate is approximately $6.7 \\times 10^2$.\n\n**4. Quantify Uncertainty via Error Propagation**\n\nThe uncertainty in $x_{50}$ depends on the uncertainties in $\\bar{y}_1$ and $\\bar{y}_2$. The variance of $x_{50}$, denoted $\\sigma^2_{x_{50}}$, is given by first-order error propagation:\n$$ \\sigma^2_{x_{50}} \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial x_{50}}{\\partial \\bar{y}_1}\\right)^2 \\sigma^2_{\\bar{y}_1} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial x_{50}}{\\partial \\bar{y}_2}\\right)^2 \\sigma^2_{\\bar{y}_2} $$\nThe terms $\\sigma^2_{\\bar{y}_1}$ and $\\sigma^2_{\\bar{y}_2}$ are the squared standard errors of the mean (SEM).\n\nFirst, calculate the sample variances ($s^2$) and SEMs for the two bracketing dilutions ($n=3$):\n-   For $d_1 = 360$, data $\\{61, 58, 63\\}$, $\\bar{y}_1=182/3$:\n    $s_1^2 = \\frac{1}{3-1}\\left[(61-\\frac{182}{3})^2 + (58-\\frac{182}{3})^2 + (63-\\frac{182}{3})^2\\right] = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[(\\frac{1}{3})^2 + (-\\frac{8}{3})^2 + (\\frac{7}{3})^2\\right] = \\frac{1}{18}[1+64+49] = \\frac{114}{18} = \\frac{19}{3}$.\n    $\\sigma^2_{\\bar{y}_1} = \\frac{s_1^2}{n} = \\frac{19/3}{3} = \\frac{19}{9} \\approx 2.111$.\n-   For $d_2 = 1080$, data $\\{42, 45, 39\\}$, $\\bar{y}_2=42$:\n    $s_2^2 = \\frac{1}{3-1}\\left[(42-42)^2 + (45-42)^2 + (39-42)^2\\right] = \\frac{1}{2}[0+9+9] = 9$.\n    $\\sigma^2_{\\bar{y}_2} = \\frac{s_2^2}{n} = \\frac{9}{3} = 3$.\n\nNext, calculate the partial derivatives of $x_{50} = x_1 + (50 - \\bar{y}_1) \\frac{x_2 - x_1}{\\bar{y}_2 - \\bar{y}_1}$:\n-   $\\frac{\\partial x_{50}}{\\partial \\bar{y}_1} = \\frac{x_2-x_1}{(\\bar{y}_2-\\bar{y}_1)^2}(50-\\bar{y}_2) = \\frac{\\log_{10}(3)}{(-56/3)^2}(50-42) = \\frac{8 \\log_{10}(3)}{3136/9} = \\frac{72 \\log_{10}(3)}{3136} = \\frac{9 \\log_{10}(3)}{392} \\approx 0.010955$.\n-   $\\frac{\\partial x_{50}}{\\partial \\bar{y}_2} = \\frac{x_2-x_1}{(\\bar{y}_2-\\bar{y}_1)^2}(\\bar{y}_1-50) = \\frac{\\log_{10}(3)}{(-56/3)^2}(\\frac{182}{3}-50) = \\frac{\\log_{10}(3)(32/3)}{3136/9} = \\frac{96 \\log_{10}(3)}{3136} = \\frac{3 \\log_{10}(3)}{98} \\approx 0.014606$.\n\nNow, calculate $\\sigma^2_{x_{50}}$:\n$$ \\sigma^2_{x_{50}} \\approx (0.010955)^2 (\\frac{19}{9}) + (0.014606)^2 (3) \\approx (0.0001200)(2.111) + (0.0002133)(3) $$\n$$ \\sigma^2_{x_{50}} \\approx 0.0002533 + 0.0006400 = 0.0008933 $$\nThe standard error of $x_{50}$ is $\\sigma_{x_{50}} = \\sqrt{0.0008933} \\approx 0.029888$.\n\n**5. Construct the 95% Confidence Interval**\n\nThe $95\\%$ CI for $x_{50}$ is constructed using a z-score of $1.96$ for the normal approximation.\n$$ \\text{CI for } x_{50} = x_{50} \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\sigma_{x_{50}} $$\n$$ \\text{CI for } x_{50} = 2.828944 \\pm 1.96 \\cdot 0.029888 = 2.828944 \\pm 0.05858 $$\n$$ \\text{CI for } x_{50} = [2.770364, 2.887524] $$\nFinally, back-transform the CI to the reciprocal dilution scale:\n-   Lower bound: $10^{2.770364} \\approx 589.3$.\n-   Upper bound: $10^{2.887524} \\approx 771.8$.\n\nThe $95\\%$ CI for the NT50 is approximately $[5.9 \\times 10^2, 7.7 \\times 10^2]$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Interpolate linearly on the semilog plot between $1{:}360$ and $1{:}1080$ using their replicate means to estimate NT50, then propagate the replicate standard errors at those two dilutions via first-order error propagation on the $\\log_{10}$ scale and back-transform. This yields NT50 $\\approx 6.7\\times 10^{2}$ with a $95\\%$ confidence interval of approximately $[5.9\\times 10^{2},\\,7.7\\times 10^{2}]$.**\nThis option correctly describes the procedure mandated by the problem's assumptions. Our derived point estimate of $\\approx 6.74 \\times 10^2$ and $95\\%$ CI of $[5.9 \\times 10^2, 7.7 \\times 10^2]$ match the reported values.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Interpolate linearly on the arithmetic dilution axis between $1{:}360$ and $1{:}1080$ using their replicate means to estimate NT50, then compute a symmetric $95\\%$ confidence interval in dilution space by standard error propagation. This yields NT50 $\\approx 7.7\\times 10^{2}$ with a $95\\%$ confidence interval of approximately $[7.0\\times 10^{2},\\,8.4\\times 10^{2}]$.**\nThis procedure violates the problem's explicit assumption to use a semilog plot (i.e., interpolate on the $\\log_{10}$ axis). Linear interpolation on the arithmetic axis is a different model.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Fit a four-parameter logistic to all dilution means and derive NT50 from the fitted curve; quantify uncertainty by plugging the mean squared error of the fit into the NT50 formula. This yields NT50 $\\approx 6.7\\times 10^{2}$ with a $95\\%$ confidence interval of approximately $[6.5\\times 10^{2},\\,6.9\\times 10^{2}]$.**\nThis procedure violates the problem's explicit assumption to \"interpolate NT50 using **only the two bracketing dilutions'** replicate means.\" While 4PL regression is a common and robust method, it is not the method specified for this particular problem.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. For each replicate, interpolate NT50 on the semilog plot between $1{:}360$ and $1{:}1080$ using that replicate’s two points, then average the three replicate NT50 values and compute a $t$-based $95\\%$ confidence interval across replicates. This yields NT50 $\\approx 6.8\\times 10^{2}$ with a $95\\%$ confidence interval of approximately $[6.13\\times 10^{2},\\,7.47\\times 10^{2}]$.**\nThis procedure violates the problem's explicit assumption to \"interpolate NT50 using only the two bracketing dilutions' **replicate means**.\" It instead requires calculating an NT50 for each replicate line and then finding the statistics of those NT50 values. This is a different statistical approach.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5091328"}]}
