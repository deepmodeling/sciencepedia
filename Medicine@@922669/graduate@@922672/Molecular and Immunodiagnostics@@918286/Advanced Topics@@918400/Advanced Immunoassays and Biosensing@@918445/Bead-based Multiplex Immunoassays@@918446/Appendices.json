I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the mean fluorescence signal per bead, which we denote as $S$. This signal is directly proportional to the number of phycoerythrin (PE) molecules attached to each bead. The signal is given by the product of the average number of PE molecules per bead, $N_{\\mathrm{PE,bead}}$, and the instrument's signal gain per PE molecule, $g_{\\mathrm{PE}}$:\n\n$$S = N_{\\mathrm{PE,bead}} \\times g_{\\mathrm{PE}}$$\n\nThe number of PE molecules per bead is determined by the average number of detection antibodies bound to each bead, $N_{D,\\text{bead}}$, and the labeling stoichiometry, which is the number of PE molecules per detection antibody, $m_{\\mathrm{PE}}$:\n\n$$N_{\\mathrm{PE,bead}} = N_{D,\\text{bead}} \\times m_{\\mathrm{PE}}$$\n\nThe number of detection antibodies bound per bead is, in turn, the product of the average number of captured analyte molecules per bead, $N_{A,\\text{bead}}$, and the fraction, $\\theta$, of those analyte molecules that are bound by a detection antibody:\n\n$$N_{D,\\text{bead}} = N_{A,\\text{bead}} \\times \\theta$$\n\nWe will now calculate each of these components based on the given parameters.\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of analyte molecules, $N_A$, present in the reaction volume $V = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{L}$. The analyte concentration is $[A] = 100\\,\\mathrm{pM} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$. Using Avogadro's constant, $\\mathcal{N}_{\\mathrm{A}} = 6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, we have:\n\n$$N_A = [A] \\times V \\times \\mathcal{N}_{\\mathrm{A}}$$\n$$N_A = (1.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\, \\mathrm{mol/L}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\, \\mathrm{L}) \\times (6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\, \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) = 6.022 \\times 10^{9} \\text{ molecules}$$\n\nThe problem states the assumption that capture is not capacity-limited. This implies that essentially all analyte molecules in the solution are captured by the beads. The total number of beads is $N_b = 5.0 \\times 10^{4}$. The average number of analyte molecules captured per bead, $N_{A,\\text{bead}}$, is therefore:\n\n$$N_{A,\\text{bead}} = \\frac{N_A}{N_b} = \\frac{6.022 \\times 10^{9}}{5.0 \\times 10^{4}} = 1.2044 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ molecules/bead}$$\n\nNext, we determine the fraction, $\\theta$, of captured analyte molecules that bind to a detection antibody. The binding of the detection antibody to the analyte's second epitope, $E_2$, is a reversible bimolecular interaction at equilibrium. The fraction of bound sites is described by the single-site binding isotherm (Hill-Langmuir equation):\n\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[D]}{K_{d,D} + [D]}$$\n\nHere, $[D]$ is the concentration of the free detection antibody, and $K_{d,D}$ is the dissociation constant for this interaction. We are given the total detection antibody concentration $[D]_{\\text{total}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and $K_{d,D} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. As verified during the validation phase, the detection antibody is in vast excess compared to the analyte. Thus, the concentration of free detection antibody, $[D]$, can be accurately approximated by the total concentration, $[D]_{\\text{total}}$.\n\n$$\\theta \\approx \\frac{[D]_{\\text{total}}}{K_{d,D} + [D]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{10\\, \\mathrm{nM}}{1.0\\, \\mathrm{nM} + 10\\, \\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{10}{11}$$\n\nNow we can assemble the complete expression for the mean per-bead fluorescence signal, $S$:\n\n$$S = N_{A,\\text{bead}} \\times \\theta \\times m_{\\mathrm{PE}} \\times g_{\\mathrm{PE}}$$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$N_{A,\\text{bead}} = 1.2044 \\times 10^{5}$\n$\\theta = \\frac{10}{11}$\n$m_{\\mathrm{PE}} = 3$\n$g_{\\mathrm{PE}} = 1.0$ RFU/PE\n\n$$S = (1.2044 \\times 10^{5}) \\times \\left(\\frac{10}{11}\\right) \\times 3 \\times 1.0$$\n$$S \\approx (1.2044 \\times 10^{5}) \\times (0.909090...) \\times 3 \\approx 328472.727... \\text{ RFU}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n\n$$S \\approx 3.285 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ RFU}$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.285 \\times 10^{5}}\n$$", "id": "5095078"}, {"introduction": "While ideal assays exhibit a monotonic dose-response curve, real-world immunoassays can suffer from artifacts like the high-dose hook effect, where the signal paradoxically decreases at very high analyte concentrations.

Derivation of the Signal Function $S(A)$**\n\nThe signal, MFI, is stated to be proportional to the fraction of bead-bound sandwich complexes. Let this concentration be $[CAD]$, where $C$ represents the bead-bound capture antibody, $A$ is the analyte, and $D$ is the detection antibody.\n$$ S(A) \\propto [CAD] $$\nThe formation of the sandwich complex $[CAD]$ is the result of two sequential equilibrium binding events.\n\nFirst, the analyte $A$ in solution binds to the capture antibody sites on the bead, which we denote as $C_{site}$.\n$$ A + C_{site} \\rightleftharpoons AC_{site} $$\nThe dissociation constant for this equilibrium is $K_1$.\n$$ K_1 = \\frac{[A][C_{site}]}{[AC_{site}]} $$\nThe fraction of occupied capture sites, $\\theta_{capture}$, is given by the Langmuir isotherm model:\n$$ \\theta_{capture} = \\frac{[AC_{site}]}{[C_{site}] + [AC_{site}]} = \\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_1} $$\nThe concentration of captured analyte, $[AC_{site}]$, is therefore proportional to this fraction.\n$$ [AC_{site}] \\propto \\frac{A}{A + K_1} $$\nFor simplicity, we use $A$ to represent the analyte concentration $[A]$, assuming it is not significantly depleted by binding.\n\nSecond, the detection antibody, $D$, which is free in solution, binds to the captured analyte to form the final sandwich complex, $AC_{site}D$.\n$$ AC_{site} + D \\rightleftharpoons AC_{site}D $$\nThe concentration of this final complex, which we have called $[CAD]$, is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants, $[AC_{site}]$ and the free detection antibody $[D]$.\n$$ [CAD] \\propto [AC_{site}] \\cdot [D] $$\nA crucial feature of the hook effect is the sequestration of the free detection antibody $D$ by excess free analyte $A$ in the solution phase.\n$$ A + D \\rightleftharpoons AD $$\nThis equilibrium is characterized by the dissociation constant $K_h$.\n$$ K_h = \\frac{[A][D]}{[AD]} $$\nLet the total concentration of detection antibody be $[D]_{\\text{tot}}$. It is distributed between its free form $[D]$, the analyte-sequestered form $[AD]$, and the form bound in sandwich complexes on the bead, $[CAD]$.\n$$ [D]_{\\text{tot}} = [D] + [AD] + [CAD] $$\nIn a typical high-dose hook effect scenario, the concentration of analyte is high, and the amount of detection antibody bound on the beads is negligible compared to the total amount in solution, i.e., $[CAD] \\ll ([D] + [AD])$. We can therefore approximate the mass balance as:\n$$ [D]_{\\text{tot}} \\approx [D] + [AD] $$\nFrom the definition of $K_h$, we have $[AD] = \\frac{[A][D]}{K_h}$. Substituting this into the mass balance equation:\n$$ [D]_{\\text{tot}} \\approx [D] + \\frac{A[D]}{K_h} = [D]\\left(1 + \\frac{A}{K_h}\\right) $$\nSolving for the free detection antibody concentration $[D]$:\n$$ [D] \\approx \\frac{[D]_{\\text{tot}}}{1 + A/K_h} = \\frac{[D]_{\\text{tot}}K_h}{A + K_h} $$\nSince $[D]_{\\text{tot}}$ and $K_h$ are constants, the concentration of free detection antibody available for binding is inversely proportional to $(A + K_h)$.\n$$ [D] \\propto \\frac{1}{A + K_h} $$\nCombining the proportionalities, the signal $S(A)$ is given by:\n$$ S(A) \\propto [AC_{site}] \\cdot [D] \\propto \\left(\\frac{A}{A + K_1}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{A + K_h}\\right) $$\nIntroducing a proportionality constant $k$, the expression for the signal is:\n$$ S(A) = k \\frac{A}{(A + K_1)(A + K_h)} $$\n\n**2. Determination of the Inversion Onset $A^{\\ast}$**\n\nThe onset of inversion (hooking), $A^{\\ast}$, is the analyte concentration at which the signal $S(A)$ reaches its maximum value. This corresponds to the point where the slope of the signal curve, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}S}{\\mathrm{d}A}$, is zero. We find this by differentiating $S(A)$ with respect to $A$ and setting the result to zero.\nLet $S(A) = k \\frac{u(A)}{v(A)}$, where $u(A) = A$ and $v(A) = (A + K_1)(A + K_h) = A^2 + (K_1 + K_h)A + K_1K_h$.\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}A}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$:\n$$ u'(A) = 1 $$\n$$ v'(A) = 2A + K_1 + K_h $$\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}S}{\\mathrm{d}A} = k \\frac{1 \\cdot (A^2 + (K_1 + K_h)A + K_1K_h) - A \\cdot (2A + K_1 + K_h)}{((A + K_1)(A + K_h))^2} $$\nSetting the numerator to zero to find the extremum:\n$$ A^2 + (K_1 + K_h)A + K_1K_h - 2A^2 - (K_1 + K_h)A = 0 $$\n$$ -A^2 + K_1K_h = 0 $$\n$$ A^2 = K_1K_h $$\nSince concentration must be a positive quantity, we take the positive square root:\n$$ A^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{K_1 K_h} $$\nFor $A < A^{\\ast}$, the numerator is positive, so $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}S}{\\mathrm{d}A} > 0$. For $A > A^{\\ast}$, the numerator is negative, so $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}S}{\\mathrm{d}A} < 0$. Thus, the slope changes from positive to negative at $A^{\\ast}$, confirming it is the inversion onset.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Inversion Interval**\n\nWe are given the parameter values $K_1 = 5.00\\,\\text{ng/mL}$ and $K_h = 2.00 \\times 10^2\\,\\text{ng/mL}$. First, we calculate $A^{\\ast}$:\n$$ A^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{(5.00)(2.00 \\times 10^2)} = \\sqrt{1000} \\approx 31.62277... \\text{ ng/mL} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $A^{\\ast} = 31.62\\,\\text{ng/mL}$.\nThe calibrated measurement window is $A \\in [A_{\\min}, A_{\\max}]$, where $A_{\\min} = 0.10\\,\\text{ng/mL}$ and $A_{\\max} = 1.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{ng/mL}$.\nThe inversion region is where the slope is negative, which is for all concentrations $A > A^{\\ast}$. The inversion interval within the measurement window is the intersection of the set $(A^{\\ast}, \\infty)$ and the interval $[A_{\\min}, A_{\\max}]$.\nSince $A_{\\min} = 0.10 < A^{\\ast} \\approx 31.62 < A_{\\max} = 1000$, the inversion interval within the window is $[A^{\\ast}, A_{\\max}]$.\nThe lower bound of this interval is $A^{\\ast} = 31.62\\,\\text{ng/mL}$.\nThe upper bound of this interval is $A_{\\max} = 1.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{ng/mL}$.\n\n**4. Calculation of the Minimum Dilution Factor $F_{\\min}$**\n\nWe need to find the smallest uniform dilution factor $F_{\\min}$ that ensures the effective concentration of any sample, $A_{diluted}$, is below the inversion onset $A^{\\ast}$. The maximum possible concentration of an undiluted sample is given as $A_{\\text{unk,max}} = 2.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{ng/mL}$.\nThe condition to be met for any sample concentration $A_{unk} \\le A_{\\text{unk,max}}$ is:\n$$ A_{diluted} = \\frac{A_{unk}}{F_{\\min}} \\le A^{\\ast} $$\nTo ensure this for all samples, we must satisfy the condition for the worst-case scenario, which is the sample with the highest concentration, $A_{\\text{unk,max}}$.\n$$ \\frac{A_{\\text{unk,max}}}{F_{\\min}} \\le A^{\\ast} $$\nTo find the smallest possible $F_{\\min}$ that satisfies this inequality, we set it as an equality:\n$$ \\frac{A_{\\text{unk,max}}}{F_{\\min}} = A^{\\ast} $$\nSolving for $F_{\\min}$:\n$$ F_{\\min} = \\frac{A_{\\text{unk,max}}}{A^{\\ast}} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ F_{\\min} = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^3}{\\sqrt{1000}} \\approx \\frac{2000}{31.62277...} \\approx 63.24555... $$\nRounding this unitless ratio to four significant figures, we get $F_{\\min} = 63.25$.\n\nThe final answer requires a row vector containing the lower bound of the inversion interval, the upper bound of the inversion interval, and $F_{\\min}$.\nLower bound = $31.62\\,\\text{ng/mL}$.\nUpper bound = $1.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{ng/mL}$.\n$F_{\\min} = 63.25$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n31.62 & 1.00 \\times 10^3 & 63.25\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5095093"}, {"introduction": "The power of multiplexing comes from measuring many analytes simultaneously, but this introduces the challenge of spectral spillover, where the signal from one fluorophore 'leaks' into another's detection channel.

Therefore, the estimator is unbiased:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{t}] = t$$\nThe deviation of the estimate from its mean is:\n$$\\hat{t} - \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{t}] = (t + S^{-1}n) - t = S^{-1}n$$\nThe squared Euclidean norm of this deviation is:\n$$\\|\\hat{t} - \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{t}]\\|^2 = \\|S^{-1}n\\|^2 = (S^{-1}n)^T(S^{-1}n) = n^T(S^{-1})^T S^{-1}n$$\nWe need to find the expectation of this quantity. This is the expectation of a quadratic form of the random vector $n$. For a random vector $x$ with mean $\\mu_x$ and covariance matrix $\\Sigma_x$, the expectation of a quadratic form $x^T A x$ is given by $\\mathbb{E}[x^T A x] = \\mathrm{Tr}(A\\Sigma_x) + \\mu_x^T A \\mu_x$. In our case, the vector is $n$, its mean is $\\mu_n=0$, its covariance matrix is $\\Sigma$, and the matrix of the quadratic form is $A = (S^{-1})^T S^{-1}$. The expectation simplifies to:\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\|\\hat{t} - \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{t}]\\|^2\\right] = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left( (S^{-1})^T S^{-1} \\Sigma \\right)$$\nThis quantity is the mean squared error of the estimate. The RMS error is its square root:\n$$\\text{RMS Error} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Tr}\\left( (S^{-1})^T S^{-1} \\Sigma \\right)}$$\nAlternatively, one can recognize that the covariance matrix of the estimate $\\hat{t}$ is $\\Sigma_{\\hat{t}} = S^{-1}\\Sigma (S^{-1})^T$. The quantity $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\hat{t} - \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{t}]\\|^2]$ is the trace of this covariance matrix, $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\Sigma_{\\hat{t}})$. The trace property $\\mathrm{Tr}(AB) = \\mathrm{Tr}(BA)$ shows the equivalence: $\\mathrm{Tr}(S^{-1}\\Sigma (S^{-1})^T) = \\mathrm{Tr}((S^{-1})^T S^{-1}\\Sigma)$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value. The given parameters are:\n$s_{12} = 0.17$, $s_{21} = 0.09$\n$\\sigma_{1} = 300$, $\\sigma_{2} = 250$, $\\rho = 0.33$\n\nThe spillover matrix is $$S = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.17 \\\\ 0.09 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$.\nThe noise covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ is:\n$$\\Sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1}^{2} & \\rho \\sigma_{1} \\sigma_{2} \\\\ \\rho \\sigma_{1} \\sigma_{2} & \\sigma_{2}^{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 300^2 & 0.33 \\times 300 \\times 250 \\\\ 0.33 \\times 300 \\times 250 & 250^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 90000 & 24750 \\\\ 24750 & 62500 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe term to be calculated is the mean squared error (MSE):\n$$\\text{MSE} = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\Sigma_{\\hat{t}}) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left( S^{-1} \\Sigma (S^{-1})^T \\right)$$\nThe diagonal elements of $\\Sigma_{\\hat{t}}$ are the variances of the estimated signals $\\hat{t}_1$ and $\\hat{t}_2$. Let $C = S^{-1}$.\n$$C = \\frac{1}{1-s_{12}s_{21}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -s_{12} \\\\ -s_{21} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{0.9847} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -0.17 \\\\ -0.09 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe trace is the sum of the diagonal elements of $\\Sigma_{\\hat{t}} = C\\Sigma C^T$.\n$$(\\Sigma_{\\hat{t}})_{11} = \\frac{1}{(\\det S)^2} (\\sigma_1^2 - 2 s_{12} \\rho\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 + s_{12}^2 \\sigma_2^2)$$\n$$(\\Sigma_{\\hat{t}})_{22} = \\frac{1}{(\\det S)^2} (s_{21}^2 \\sigma_1^2 - 2 s_{21} \\rho\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 + \\sigma_2^2)$$\n$$\\text{MSE} = \\mathrm{Tr}(\\Sigma_{\\hat{t}}) = (\\Sigma_{\\hat{t}})_{11} + (\\Sigma_{\\hat{t}})_{22} = \\frac{1}{(\\det S)^2} \\left[ (1+s_{21}^2)\\sigma_1^2 + (1+s_{12}^2)\\sigma_2^2 - 2(s_{12}+s_{21})\\rho\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 \\right]$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$\\det S = 0.9847$\n$\\sigma_1^2 = 90000$\n$\\sigma_2^2 = 62500$\n$s_{12}^2 = 0.17^2 = 0.0289$\n$s_{21}^2 = 0.09^2 = 0.0081$\n$s_{12}+s_{21} = 0.17+0.09 = 0.26$\n$\\rho\\sigma_1\\sigma_2 = 24750$\n\n$$\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{0.9847^2} \\left[ (1+0.0081)(90000) + (1+0.0289)(62500) - 2(0.26)(24750) \\right]$$\n$$\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{0.96963209} \\left[ (1.0081)(90000) + (1.0289)(62500) - (0.52)(24750) \\right]$$\n$$\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{0.96963209} \\left[ 90729 + 64306.25 - 12870 \\right]$$\n$$\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{0.96963209} \\left[ 142165.25 \\right] \\approx 146617.5$$\nThe RMS error is the square root of the MSE:\n$$\\text{RMS Error} = \\sqrt{146617.5} \\approx 382.9066$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $382.9$.
