Using the points for $C=1.00$ fM and $C=10.0$ fM:\n$$m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{32.000 - 36.000}{\\log_{10}(10.0) - \\log_{10}(1.00)} = \\frac{-4.0}{1-0} = -4.0$$\nThe intercept $b$ is the value of $C_t$ when $\\log_{10}(C) = 0$, which corresponds to $C=1.00$ fM. From the data, $b = 36.000$.\nThus, the linear calibration model is:\n$$C_t = -4.0 \\cdot \\log_{10}(C) + 36.0$$\n\nThird, we calculate the LoD. The LoD is determined from the $C_t$ value that corresponds to the mean of the blank measurements plus $3$ times their standard deviation ($3s$).\nThe five blank $C_t$ measurements are: $39.20$, $39.54$, $39.35$, $39.62$, $39.43$.\nThe mean ($\\bar{x}_{blank}$) of these measurements is:\n$$\\bar{x}_{blank} = \\frac{39.20 + 39.54 + 39.35 + 39.62 + 39.43}{5} = \\frac{196.14}{5} = 39.428$$\nNext, we calculate the sample standard deviation ($s$):\n$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x}_{blank})^2}$$\nThe sum of squared deviations from the mean is:\n$$\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x}_{blank})^2 = (39.20-39.428)^2 + (39.54-39.428)^2 + (39.35-39.428)^2 + (39.62-39.428)^2 + (39.43-39.428)^2$$\n$$\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x}_{blank})^2 = (-0.228)^2 + (0.112)^2 + (-0.078)^2 + (0.192)^2 + (0.002)^2$$\n$$\\sum(x_i - \\bar{x}_{blank})^2 = 0.051984 + 0.012544 + 0.006084 + 0.036864 + 0.000004 = 0.10748$$\nThe sample variance $s^2$ is:\n$$s^2 = \\frac{0.10748}{5-1} = \\frac{0.10748}{4} = 0.02687$$\nThe sample standard deviation $s$ is:\n$$s = \\sqrt{0.02687} \\approx 0.1639207$$\nThe $C_t$ value for the LoD, denoted $C_{t,LoD}$, is given by the mean plus $3s$ criterion:\n$$C_{t,LoD} = \\bar{x}_{blank} + 3s = 39.428 + 3 \\times 0.1639207 \\approx 39.428 + 0.4917621 \\approx 39.9197621$$\nFinally, we use the inverse of our calibration model to find the concentration $C_{LoD}$ corresponding to $C_{t,LoD}$.\nFirst, we rearrange the model to solve for $C$:\n$$C_t = -4.0 \\log_{10}(C) + 36.0$$\n$$C_t - 36.0 = -4.0 \\log_{10}(C)$$\n$$\\log_{10}(C) = \\frac{36.0 - C_t}{4.0}$$\n$$C = 10^{\\frac{36.0 - C_t}{4.0}}$$\nNow, we substitute $C_{t,LoD}$ into this equation:\n$$C_{LoD} = 10^{\\frac{36.0 - 39.9197621}{4.0}} = 10^{\\frac{-3.9197621}{4.0}} = 10^{-0.979940525}$$\n$$C_{LoD} \\approx 0.10472739 \\text{ fM}$$\nThe problem requires the concentration to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$C_{LoD} \\approx 0.1047 \\text{ fM}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1047}$$", "id": "5150825"}]}
