The assumptions (non-overlapping footprints, monolayer, void-free tiling) are standard idealizations for calculating a theoretical maximum. The problem is well-posed, as it provides all necessary definitions, constants, and values to arrive at a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n### Derivation of the Maximum Molar Surface Density, $\\Gamma_{\\max}$\nLet $\\sigma$ be the surface number density, defined as the number of molecules, $N$, adsorbed on a surface of area $S$:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{N}{S}\n$$\nThe units of $\\sigma$ are molecules per unit area (e.g., $\\mathrm{molecules}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$).\n\nThe problem states that at maximum packing, the entire surface is tiled by the footprints of the immobilized ligands. This implies that the total surface area $S$ is equal to the sum of the areas of all the individual molecular footprints. If there are $N$ molecules, each with a footprint area $A_f$, then the total area they occupy is:\n$$\nS = N \\times A_f\n$$\nThe maximum surface number density, $\\sigma_{\\max}$, is therefore achieved under this condition. By substituting the expression for $S$ into the definition of $\\sigma$, we find:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\max} = \\frac{N}{N \\times A_f} = \\frac{1}{A_f}\n$$\nNext, we relate the surface number density ($\\sigma$) to the molar surface density ($\\Gamma$). The molar surface density is defined as the number of moles, $n$, per unit area $S$:\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\frac{n}{S}\n$$\nThe number of molecules $N$ is related to the number of moles $n$ through Avogadro's number, $N_A$, by the relation $N = n \\times N_A$.

The uncertainty in the transformed dependent variable $y_i = I_i (V_0 + V_{a,i,\\text{cum}})$ is found by error propagation, assuming volumes are exact:\n$$\\sigma_{y_i}^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\partial y_i}{\\partial I_i} \\right)^2 \\sigma_I^2 = (V_0 + V_{a,i,\\text{cum}})^2 \\sigma_I^2$$\nSince $\\sigma_{y_i}^2$ depends on $i$, the noise in the transformed $y_i$ is heteroscedastic. A Weighted Least Squares (WLS) fit is necessary for a statistically efficient estimation. The weights $w_i$ are the inverse of the variances:\n$$w_i = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{y_i}^2} = \\frac{1}{(V_0 + V_{a,i,\\text{cum}})^2 \\sigma_I^2}$$\n\nFirst, we compile the data points $(x_i, y_i)$ for the regression.\nGiven values: $V_0 = 500.0~\\mu\\text{L}$, $C_s = 1.00~\\mu\\text{M} = 1000.0~\\text{nM}$, $\\sigma_I = 0.200~\\text{nA}$.\nThe cumulative added volumes are $V_{a,0,\\text{cum}}=0~\\mu\\text{L}$, $V_{a,1,\\text{cum}}=2.00~\\mu\\text{L}$, and $V_{a,2,\\text{cum}}=6.00~\\mu\\text{L}$.\n-   Point $i=0$: $x_0 = 0~\\mu\\text{L}$, $I_0 = 42.000~\\text{nA}$\n    $y_0 = I_0(V_0+x_0) = 42.000 \\times (500.0 + 0) = 21000.0~\\text{nA}\\cdot\\mu\\text{L}$\n-   Point $i=1$: $x_1 = 2.00~\\mu\\text{L}$, $I_1 = 44.620~\\text{nA}$\n    $y_1 = I_1(V_0+x_1) = 44.620 \\times (500.0 + 2.00) = 22399.24~\\text{nA}\\cdot\\mu\\text{L}$\n-   Point $i=2$: $x_2 = 6.00~\\mu\\text{L}$, $I_2 = 49.801~\\text{nA}$\n    $y_2 = I_2(V_0+x_2) = 49.801 \\times (500.0 + 6.00) = 25199.306~\\text{nA}\\cdot\\mu\\text{L}$\n\nThe WLS estimates for $b$ and $m$ are found by solving the normal equations, which can be expressed in matrix form as $\\mathbf{p} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{y}$, where $\\mathbf{p} = (b, m)^T$.\nLet's define the required weighted sums, using relative weights $w'_i = 1/(V_0+V_{a,i,cum})^2$ for simplicity, as any constant factor in the weights cancels out when solving for $b$ and $m$.\n$w'_0 = 1/500^2 = 4.00000 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mu\\text{L}^{-2}$\n$w'_1 = 1/502^2 = 3.96819 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mu\\text{L}^{-2}$\n$w'_2 = 1/506^2 = 3.90489 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mu\\text{L}^{-2}$\n\n$S_w = \\sum w'_i = 1.187308 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mu\\text{L}^{-2}$\n$S_{wx} = \\sum w'_i x_i = 3.136572 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mu\\text{L}^{-1}$\n$S_{wy} = \\sum w'_i y_i = 0.271285~\\text{nA}\\cdot\\mu\\text{L}^{-1}$\n$S_{wxx} = \\sum w'_i x_i^2 = 1.564488 \\times 10^{-4}$\n$S_{wxy} = \\sum w'_i x_i y_i = 0.768169~\\text{nA}$\n\nThe determinant of the WLS matrix is $\\Delta' = S_w S_{wxx} - (S_{wx})^2 = 8.73832 \\times 10^{-10}~\\mu\\text{L}^{-2}$.\nThe slope $m$ and intercept $b$ are given by:\n$$m = \\frac{S_w S_{wxy} - S_{wx} S_{wy}}{\\Delta'} = 700.08~\\text{nA}$$\n$$b = \\frac{S_{wxx} S_{wy} - S_{wx} S_{wxy}}{\\Delta'} = 20989.5~\\text{nA}\\cdot\\mu\\text{L}$$\nNow, we calculate the unknown concentration $C_x$:\n$$C_x = \\frac{b}{m} \\frac{C_s}{V_0} = \\frac{20989.5~\\text{nA}\\cdot\\mu\\text{L}}{700.08~\\text{nA}} \\frac{1000.0~\\text{nM}}{500.0~\\mu\\text{L}} = 29.981~\\mu\\text{L} \\times 2.000~\\frac{\\text{nM}}{\\mu\\text{L}} = 59.962~\\text{nM}$$\n\n### Part 3: Uncertainty Propagation for $C_x$\n\nThe uncertainty in $C_x$ depends on the uncertainties in the fitted parameters $b$ and $m$ and their covariance. The function is $C_x(b, m) = K (b/m)$, where $K=C_s/V_0$ is a constant. The variance $\\sigma_{C_x}^2$ is given by first-order uncertainty propagation:\n$$\\sigma_{C_x}^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial C_x}{\\partial b}\\right)^2 \\sigma_b^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial C_x}{\\partial m}\\right)^2 \\sigma_m^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{\\partial C_x}{\\partial b}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial C_x}{\\partial m}\\right)\\text{Cov}(b,m)$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial C_x}{\\partial b} = \\frac{K}{m}$ and $\\frac{\\partial C_x}{\\partial m} = -\\frac{Kb}{m^2}$.\nSubstituting these gives:\n$$\\sigma_{C_x}^2 = \\frac{K^2}{m^4} \\left(m^2 \\sigma_b^2 + b^2 \\sigma_m^2 - 2mb \\, \\text{Cov}(b,m)\\right)$$\nThe covariance matrix of the-fitted parameters $(b, m)$ is $\\text{Cov}(\\mathbf{p}) = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} = \\sigma_I^2 (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{W'} \\mathbf{X})^{-1}$, where $\\mathbf{W}$ is the matrix of true weights $w_i = w'_i/\\sigma_I^2$.\nThe elements of the covariance matrix are:\n$$\\sigma_b^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_I^2 S_{wxx}}{\\Delta'} \\quad, \\quad \\sigma_m^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_I^2 S_w}{\\Delta'} \\quad, \\quad \\text{Cov}(b,m) = -\\frac{\\sigma_I^2 S_{wx}}{\\Delta'}$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\sigma_{C_x}^2$ yields:\n$$\\sigma_{C_x}^2 = \\frac{K^2 \\sigma_I^2}{m^4 \\Delta'} \\left( m^2 S_{wxx} + b^2 S_w + 2mb S_{wx} \\right)$$\nUsing $\\sigma_I^2 = (0.200)^2 = 0.0400~\\text{nA}^2$ and the values for $m, b,$ and the weighted sums calculated previously:\n$\\sigma_b^2 = \\frac{0.0400 \\times 1.564488 \\times 10^{-4}}{8.73832 \\times 10^{-10}} = 7161.4~(\\text{nA}\\cdot\\mu\\text{L})^2$\n$\\sigma_m^2 = \\frac{0.0400 \\times 1.187308 \\times 10^{-5}}{8.73832 \\times 10^{-10}} = 543.50~(\\text{nA})^2$\n$\\text{Cov}(b,m) = -\\frac{0.0400 \\times 3.136572 \\times 10^{-5}}{8.73832 \\times 10^{-10}} = -1435.8~(\\text{nA})^2\\cdot\\mu\\text{L}$\n\nWe can now compute the total variance $\\sigma_{C_x}^2$. Let's calculate the value of the term in brackets:\n$m^2 \\sigma_b^2 = (700.08)^2(7161.4) = 3.510 \\times 10^9$\n$b^2 \\sigma_m^2 = (20989.5)^2(543.50) = 2.394 \\times 10^{11}$\n$-2mb\\,\\text{Cov}(b,m) = -2(700.08)(20989.5)(-1435.8) = 4.219 \\times 10^{10}$\n\nThe sum of these terms is $(3.510 \\times 10^9 + 2.394 \\times 10^{11} + 4.219 \\times 10^{10}) = 2.851 \\times 10^{11}$.\nPlugging this into the full expression for $\\sigma_{C_x}^2$:\n$$\\sigma_{C_x}^2 = \\frac{(2.000~\\text{nM}/\\mu\\text{L})^2}{(700.08~\\text{nA})^4} \\left(m^2 \\sigma_b^2 + b^2 \\sigma_m^2 - 2mb \\, \\text{Cov}(b,m)\\right)$$\n$$\\sigma_{C_x}^2 = \\frac{4.000}{(700.08)^4} \\left( 2.851 \\times 10^{11} \\right) = \\frac{4.000}{2.402 \\times 10^{11}} \\left( 2.851 \\times 10^{11} \\right) = 4.748~(\\text{nM})^2$$\nThe standard uncertainty is the square root of the variance:\n$$\\sigma_{C_x} = \\sqrt{4.748} = 2.179~\\text{nM}$$\nRounding the concentration and its uncertainty to three significant figures, as requested:\n$C_x = 60.0~\\text{nM}$\n$\\sigma_{C_x} = 2.18~\\text{nM}$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 60.0  2.18 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "5111246"}]}
