The question asks for a derivable quantity (an expectation) based on these parameters. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not violate any scientific principles or contain ambiguities. It is a formalizable problem directly relevant to error-corrected sequencing.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe goal is to find the expected number of reads that erroneously report a specific alternate base at a locus where the true base is the reference. Such reads are, by definition, false positives.\n\nLet us begin by considering a single read. We need to determine the probability that this single read is a false positive variant-supporting read. Let this probability be denoted by $q$.\n\nThe problem states that for a read to be counted as variant-supporting, it must report a *specific* pre-specified alternate base. Since the true base at the locus is the reference base, this can only happen if a sequencing error occurs.\n\nThe overall probability of a per-base substitution error at the locus for any given read is given as $p$.\n\nThe substitution error model is symmetric. This means that if a substitution error occurs, the machine will report one of the three possible non-reference bases with equal probability. Let the set of bases be $\\{A, C, G, T\\}$. If the reference base is, for instance, $A$, then the three non-reference bases are $\\{C, G, T\\}$. The SNV of interest corresponds to exactly one of these, say $G$.\n\nTherefore, for a single read to be a false positive supporting this specific SNV, two conditions must be met:\n1.  A substitution error must occur. The probability of this event is $P(\\text{error}) = p$.\n2.  Given that a substitution error has occurred, the error must be to the specific alternate base of interest. Since there are three possible non-reference bases, and each is equally likely upon an error, the conditional probability of this event is $P(\\text{specific alternate} | \\text{error}) = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThe probability $q$ that a single read is a false positive supporting the specific variant is the joint probability of these two events. Since the type of error is independent of the occurrence of the error, we can multiply their probabilities:\n$$q = P(\\text{error} \\cap \\text{specific alternate}) = P(\\text{error}) \\times P(\\text{specific alternate} | \\text{error})$$\n$$q = p \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{p}{3}$$\n\nNow, we must consider the total of $D$ independent reads at the locus. Let $X_i$ be an indicator random variable for the $i$-th read, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $D$. The variable $X_i$ is defined as:\n$$\nX_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if read } i \\text{ is a false positive variant-supporting read} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe probability that $X_i=1$ is $q = \\frac{p}{3}$, and the probability that $X_i=0$ is $1-q = 1-\\frac{p}{3}$.\n\nThe total number of false positive variant-supporting reads in the set of $D$ reads is the random variable $X = \\sum_{i=1}^{D} X_i$. We are asked to find the expected value of $X$, denoted $E[X]$.\n\nA fundamental property of expectation is its linearity. The expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations, regardless of whether they are independent.\n$$E[X] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{D} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{D} E[X_i]$$\n\nThe expectation of an indicator random variable $X_i$ is simply the probability of the event it indicates:\n$$E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i=0) = P(X_i=1) = q = \\frac{p}{3}$$\n\nSince each read is subject to the same error process, the expectation is the same for all $i$.\n$$E[X_i] = \\frac{p}{3} \\quad \\text{for all } i=1, \\dots, D$$\n\nSubstituting this back into the sum:\n$$E[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{D} \\frac{p}{3}$$\n\nThis is a sum of $D$ identical terms. Therefore, the expected number of false positive variant-supporting reads is:\n$$E[X] = D \\times \\frac{p}{3} = \\frac{Dp}{3}$$\n\nThis result is derived from first principles, using the definition of the event, the chain rule for probability, and the linearity of expectation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{Dp}{3}}$$", "id": "5113749"}, {"introduction": "Having established the challenge of raw sequencing errors, we now explore the foundational strategy for mitigating them: consensus calling from a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) family.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all necessary information is provided. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Analytical Expression\n\nLet us model the state of each of the $k$ reads as a Bernoulli trial. For a given read, let the outcome be an \"error\" if the read reports a base different from the true template base, and \"correct\" otherwise. The problem states that the probability of a base-substitution error is $p$. Therefore, for a single trial:\n- The probability of an \"error\" is $p$.\n- The probability of being \"correct\" is $1-p$.\n\nWe have $k$ such reads, which are stipulated to be independent and identical. Let $X$ be the random variable representing the total number of errors (incorrect reads) among the $k$ reads. Since the trials are independent and have the same error probability, $X$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $k$ (number of trials) and $p$ (probability of success, i.e., an error). We write this as $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(k, p)$.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of the binomial distribution gives the probability of observing exactly $i$ errors in $k$ trials:\n$$\nP(X=i) = \\binom{k}{i} p^i (1-p)^{k-i}\n$$\nwhere $\\binom{k}{i} = \\frac{k!}{i!(k-i)!}$ is the binomial coefficient, representing the number of ways to choose $i$ error-containing reads from a total of $k$ reads. This formula is valid for $i = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, k$.\n\nA consensus base for the UMI family is determined by a simple majority vote. An incorrect consensus will be called if the number of reads with an error is greater than the number of correct reads. Let $i$ be the number of reads with an error. The number of correct reads is then $k-i$. The condition for an incorrect consensus is:\n$$\ni > k-i\n$$\n$$\n2i > k\n$$\n$$\ni > \\frac{k}{2}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $k$ is an odd integer. Let $k = 2m+1$ for some non-negative integer $m$. The condition for an incorrect consensus becomes $i > \\frac{2m+1}{2} = m + \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $i$ must be an integer, this is equivalent to $i \\ge m+1$. Noting that $m = \\frac{k-1}{2}$, the minimum number of errors required for an incorrect call is $i_{min} = m+1 = \\frac{k-1}{2} + 1 = \\frac{k+1}{2}$.\n\nThe probability of an incorrect consensus, denoted $P_{\\text{error}}$, is the probability that the number of errors $X$ is greater than $k/2$. This is the sum of the probabilities of all possible numbers of errors that satisfy this condition, which are $i = \\frac{k+1}{2}, \\frac{k+1}{2}+1, \\dots, k$.\nTherefore, the analytical expression for the consensus error probability is:\n$$\nP_{\\text{error}} = P\\left(X \\ge \\frac{k+1}{2}\\right) = \\sum_{i=\\frac{k+1}{2}}^{k} P(X=i)\n$$\nSubstituting the binomial PMF, we obtain the final expression:\n$$\nP_{\\text{error}}(k, p) = \\sum_{i=\\frac{k+1}{2}}^{k} \\binom{k}{i} p^i (1-p)^{k-i}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\n### Evaluation for Specific Parameters\n\nWe are asked to evaluate this probability for a UMI family size of $k=7$ and a per-read error probability of $p=0.01$.\nFor $k=7$, the minimum number of errors for an incorrect consensus is $\\frac{7+1}{2} = 4$. Thus, an incorrect consensus occurs if there are $4$, $5$, $6$, or $7$ errors. We must calculate $P(X \\ge 4)$.\n\nThe probability is given by the sum:\n$$\nP_{\\text{error}} = P(X=4) + P(X=5) + P(X=6) + P(X=7)\n$$\nUsing the derived formula with $k=7$, $p=0.01$, and $1-p=0.99$:\n$$\nP_{\\text{error}} = \\sum_{i=4}^{7} \\binom{7}{i} (0.01)^i (0.99)^{7-i}\n$$\nWe calculate each term:\n- For $i=4$: $\\binom{7}{4} (0.01)^4 (0.99)^3 = \\frac{7!}{4!3!} (10^{-2})^4 (0.99)^3 = 35 \\times 10^{-8} \\times (0.970299) \\approx 3.3960465 \\times 10^{-7}$\n- For $i=5$: $\\binom{7}{5} (0.01)^5 (0.99)^2 = \\frac{7!}{5!2!} (10^{-2})^5 (0.99)^2 = 21 \\times 10^{-10} \\times (0.9801) \\approx 2.05821 \\times 10^{-9}$\n- For $i=6$: $\\binom{7}{6} (0.01)^6 (0.99)^1 = \\frac{7!}{6!1!} (10^{-2})^6 (0.99)^1 = 7 \\times 10^{-12} \\times (0.99) \\approx 6.93 \\times 10^{-12}$\n- For $i=7$: $\\binom{7}{7} (0.01)^7 (0.99)^0 = \\frac{7!}{7!0!} (10^{-2})^7 (1) = 1 \\times 10^{-14}$\n\nSumming these terms:\n$$\nP_{\\text{error}} \\approx 3.3960465 \\times 10^{-7} + 2.05821 \\times 10^{-9} + 6.93 \\times 10^{-12} + 1 \\times 10^{-14}\n$$\n$$\nP_{\\text{error}} \\approx 3.3960465 \\times 10^{-7} + 0.0205821 \\times 10^{-7} + 0.0000693 \\times 10^{-7} + 0.0000001 \\times 10^{-7}\n$$\n$$\nP_{\\text{error}} \\approx 3.4166979 \\times 10^{-7}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $3.417 \\times 10^{-7}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.417 \\times 10^{-7}}$$", "id": "5113757"}, {"introduction": "For the most demanding applications, such as detecting ultra-rare mutations in circulating tumor DNA, even a simple UMI consensus may not be sufficient.
