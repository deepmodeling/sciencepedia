It is not tautological.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the expected fraction of wells containing exactly one bead. This is a two-part process: first, deriving the probability distribution for the number of beads in a single well, and second, relating this single-well probability to the multiwell fraction.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Single-Well Bead Count Distribution**\n\nLet $X_n$ be the random variable representing the number of beads that have arrived in a single well after $n$ discrete time subintervals. According to the problem statement, each subinterval is an independent Bernoulli trial with a success probability of $p_n$ (where success is defined as a bead arrival). The total number of arrivals in $n$ trials, $X_n$, therefore follows a binomial distribution:\n$$\nX_n \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p_n)\n$$\nThe probability mass function for $X_n$ is given by:\n$$\nP(X_n = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p_n^k (1-p_n)^{n-k}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of bead arrivals, $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nThe problem states that the continuous-time process is modeled by taking the limit as $n \\to \\infty$. We are given the condition that $n p_n \\to \\mu$ in this limit. Let $X$ be the random variable for the number of bead arrivals over the total duration $T$ in this limiting case. We find the probability mass function of $X$ by evaluating the limit of $P(X_n = k)$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\n$$\nP(X = k) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} P(X_n = k) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\binom{n}{k} p_n^k (1-p_n)^{n-k}\n$$\nWe analyze the components of this expression. First, expand the binomial coefficient:\n$$\n\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!}\n$$\nThe expression for the probability becomes:\n$$\nP(X_n = k) = \\frac{n(n-1)\\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!} p_n^k (1-p_n)^{n-k}\n$$\nWe can rewrite this by associating factors of $n$ with $p_n$:\n$$\nP(X_n = k) = \\frac{1}{k!} \\left[ \\frac{n}{n} \\cdot \\frac{n-1}{n} \\cdots \\frac{n-k+1}{n} \\right] (np_n)^k (1-p_n)^{n-k}\n$$\nNow, we take the limit as $n \\to \\infty$. We evaluate the limit of each term separately:\n1.  The term in square brackets is a product of $k$ factors:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\frac{n}{n} \\cdot \\frac{n-1}{n} \\cdots \\frac{n-k+1}{n} \\right] = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left[ 1 \\cdot \\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\cdots \\left(1-\\frac{k-1}{n}\\right) \\right]\n    $$\n    Since $k$ is a fixed integer, as $n \\to \\infty$, each term in the product approaches $1$. Thus, the limit of the entire product is $1$.\n\n2.  The $(np_n)^k$ term, based on the given condition, approaches:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (np_n)^k = \\mu^k\n    $$\n\n3.  The term $(1-p_n)^{n-k}$ is handled by substituting $p_n = \\frac{np_n}{n}$. In the limit, we can substitute $\\mu$ for $np_n$:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (1-p_n)^{n-k} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{np_n}{n}\\right)^{n-k} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mu}{n}\\right)^{n-k}\n    $$\n    We can split this into two parts:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mu}{n}\\right)^n \\cdot \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mu}{n}\\right)^{-k}\n    $$\n    The first part is a standard definition of the exponential function, $\\exp(-\\mu)$:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mu}{n}\\right)^n = \\exp(-\\mu)\n    $$\n    For the second part, since $k$ is fixed, as $n \\to \\infty$, $\\frac{\\mu}{n} \\to 0$, and thus $(1 - \\frac{\\mu}{n}) \\to 1$. Therefore:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mu}{n}\\right)^{-k} = 1^{-k} = 1\n    $$\n    So, the limit of the third term is $\\exp(-\\mu)$.\n\nCombining these results, we obtain the probability mass function for $X$:\n$$\nP(X=k) = \\frac{1}{k!} \\cdot (1) \\cdot (\\mu^k) \\cdot (\\exp(-\\mu)) = \\frac{\\mu^k \\exp(-\\mu)}{k!}\n$$\nThis is the probability mass function of a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\mu$. The problem asks for the probability that a well contains *exactly one* bead, which corresponds to $k=1$.\n$$\nP(X=1) = \\frac{\\mu^1 \\exp(-\\mu)}{1!} = \\mu \\exp(-\\mu)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Justification for the Multiwell Fraction**\n\nThe quantity $p = P(X=1) = \\mu \\exp(-\\mu)$ is the probability that a *single, specific* well contains exactly one bead. The problem asks for the *expected fraction* of all $W$ wells that contain exactly one bead.\n\nLet $Y_i$ be an indicator random variable for the $i$-th well, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, W\\}$. We define $Y_i$ as:\n$$\nY_i = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if well } i \\text{ contains exactly one bead} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe bead loading process is independent for each well, so the random variables $Y_1, Y_2, \\dots, Y_W$ are independent and identically distributed. The probability of success for each is $p = P(Y_i=1) = \\mu \\exp(-\\mu)$.\n\nThe total number of wells with exactly one bead is the sum of these indicator variables: $N_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{W} Y_i$.\nThe fraction of wells with one bead is $F_1 = \\frac{N_1}{W} = \\frac{1}{W} \\sum_{i=1}^{W} Y_i$.\n\nThe problem asks for the *expected* fraction. By the linearity of expectation:\n$$\nE[F_1] = E\\left[\\frac{1}{W} \\sum_{i=1}^{W} Y_i\\right] = \\frac{1}{W} \\sum_{i=1}^{W} E[Y_i]\n$$\nThe expected value of an indicator random variable is the probability of the event it indicates:\n$$\nE[Y_i] = 1 \\cdot P(Y_i=1) + 0 \\cdot P(Y_i=0) = P(Y_i=1) = p = \\mu \\exp(-\\mu)\n$$\nSince this is true for all $i$, the sum becomes:\n$$\nE[F_1] = \\frac{1}{W} \\sum_{i=1}^{W} p = \\frac{1}{W} (Wp) = p\n$$\nTherefore, the expected fraction of wells containing exactly one bead is $p = \\mu \\exp(-\\mu)$.\n\nThe problem also requires justification using a law of large numbers. For a large number of wells $W$ (as is typical for a CMOS semiconductor sequencing chip), the (Weak) Law of Large Numbers states that the sample average $F_1 = \\frac{1}{W} \\sum_{i=1}^{W} Y_i$ converges in probability to the true expectation $E[Y_i] = p$. This means that for a large $W$, the observed fraction of singly-occupied wells will be very close to its expected value, $p$. Thus, $p = \\mu \\exp(-\\mu)$ is the theoretically predicted and experimentally expected fraction.\n\nThe final analytical expression for the expected fraction is solely a function of $\\mu$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\mu \\exp(-\\mu)}\n$$", "id": "5160012"}, {"introduction": "Once a bead is successfully loaded, the sequencing reaction begins.

The problem states that $N$ incorporations occur, with each incorporation releasing exactly one proton ($H^+$). The total number of protons released is therefore $N$.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Analysis of the Model and Underlying Principles\n\nThe problem asks to assess the origin of nonlinearity and the plausibility of the model $V(n) = a(1 - e^{-bn})$. The sources of nonlinearity are all saturation effects. A simple conceptual model for such effects is that the incremental change in signal is proportional to the remaining capacity. Let $V(n)$ be the voltage signal for a homopolymer of length $n$. Let $a$ be the maximum possible voltage signal (asymptotic saturation). The \"remaining capacity\" is $a - V(n)$. If the voltage increase for the $(n+1)$-th incorporation is proportional to this remaining capacity, we can write a difference equation:\n$$ V(n+1) - V(n) = k(a - V(n)) $$\nwhere $k$ is a proportionality constant. This is a linear first-order difference equation, $V(n+1) = (1-k)V(n) + ka$. With the initial condition $V(0)=0$, the solution is:\n$$ V(n) = a(1 - (1-k)^n) $$\nBy defining $e^{-b} = 1-k$, where $b = -\\ln(1-k)$, the model becomes:\n$$ V(n) = a(1 - (e^{-b})^n) = a(1 - e^{-bn}) $$\nThis demonstrates that the proposed exponential saturation model is a direct and plausible consequence of a first-order saturation hypothesis, which serves as a reasonable abstraction for the combined effects of finite buffering, transport limitations, and other saturation phenomena described.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The nonlinearity in $V(n)$ arises from first-order saturation effects spanning buffering, transport, and ISFET interface dynamics; modeling the incremental captured proton signal per incorporation as a constant fraction of the remaining capacity leads to a discrete first-order difference equation with solution of the form $V(n)=a(1-e^{-bn})$, in which $a$ is the asymptotic maximum voltage and $b$ aggregates effective sensitivity and capacity.**\n\nAs derived above, the model $V(n)=a(1-e^{-bn})$ is precisely the solution to a first-order difference equation describing a process where the incremental gain is proportional to the remaining capacity. This is a classic model for saturation phenomena. The parameter $a$ represents the limit of $V(n)$ as $n \\to \\infty$, so it is the asymptotic maximum voltage. The parameter $b$ is related to the constant of proportionality $k$, which dictates how quickly the signal approaches saturation; it acts as an effective parameter lumping together all the complex underlying rate-limiting and capacity-limiting factors. This statement is a correct and insightful description of the model's origin and interpretation.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because proton release increases linearly with $n$, the output must remain linear for large $n$; the appropriate calibration near $n\\to\\infty$ is $V(n)=c\\,n$ with constant $c$, and any saturation model such as $V(n)=a(1-e^{-bn})$ will under-correct high-$n$ measurements.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. While it is true that the number of protons released is linear with $n$, the problem statement explicitly details multiple physical reasons (finite buffer capacity, diffusion limits, enzyme saturation) why the *measured voltage signal* is *not* linear with $n$. These effects cause the system to saturate. Claiming that the output \"must remain linear for large $n$\" directly contradicts the provided physical description and the observed data, which clearly show diminishing returns. A saturation model is required to accurately model the response, whereas a linear model $V(n)=c n$ would fail catastrophically for large $n$ by predicting unbounded voltage.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Linearizing the model by plotting $-\\ln\\left(1-\\frac{V(n)}{a}\\right)$ against $n$ yields a line of slope $b$. With the dataset $V(1)=0.12$, $V(2)=0.22$, $V(4)=0.35$, $V(8)=0.48$, a consistent fit is obtained for approximately $a\\approx 0.55$ volts and $b\\approx 0.25$ per base.**\n\nFirst, we verify the linearization. Rearranging the model $V = a(1 - e^{-bn})$ gives $\\frac{V}{a} = 1 - e^{-bn}$, then $1 - \\frac{V}{a} = e^{-bn}$, and taking the natural logarithm gives $\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{V}{a}\\right) = -bn$. Finally, multiplying by $-1$ gives $-\\ln\\left(1-\\frac{V}{a}\\right) = bn$. This confirms that a plot of $Y = -\\ln\\left(1-\\frac{V}{a}\\right)$ versus $X = n$ should be a straight line through the origin with slope $b$.\n\nNext, we test the proposed parameter values $a = 0.55$ and $b = 0.25$ with the given data. We calculate the value of $b$ for each data point using $b = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - V(n)/a)}{n}$.\n- For $n=1, V(1)=0.12$: $b_1 = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - 0.12/0.55)}{1} = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - 0.2182)}{1} \\approx \\frac{-\\ln(0.7818)}{1} \\approx 0.246$.\n- For $n=2, V(2)=0.22$: $b_2 = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - 0.22/0.55)}{2} = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - 0.4)}{2} = \\frac{-\\ln(0.6)}{2} \\approx \\frac{0.5108}{2} \\approx 0.255$.\n- For $n=4, V(4)=0.35$: $b_4 = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - 0.35/0.55)}{4} = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - 0.6364)}{4} \\approx \\frac{-\\ln(0.3636)}{4} \\approx \\frac{1.0116}{4} \\approx 0.253$.\n- For $n=8, V(8)=0.48$: $b_8 = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - 0.48/0.55)}{8} = \\frac{-\\ln(1 - 0.8727)}{8} \\approx \\frac{-\\ln(0.1273)}{8} \\approx \\frac{2.0614}{8} \\approx 0.258$.\n\nThe calculated values for $b$ are $\\{0.246, 0.255, 0.253, 0.258\\}$, all of which are very close to the proposed value of $b \\approx 0.25$. This shows a consistent fit of the model with the given parameters to the experimental data.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. For the model $V(n)=a(1-e^{-bn})$, the derivative $\\frac{dV}{dn}=ab\\,e^{-bn}$ is constant with respect to $n$, implying a linear response; therefore this model cannot capture saturation in homopolymer detection.**\n\nThe derivative calculation is correct:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dn} = \\frac{d}{dn} \\left( a - ae^{-bn} \\right) = -a(-b)e^{-bn} = ab\\,e^{-bn} $$\nHowever, the statement asserts that this derivative is \"constant with respect to $n$\". This is false. The derivative contains the term $e^{-bn}$, which is a function of $n$. Since $b > 0$, as $n$ increases, the exponential term $e^{-bn}$ decreases towards $0$. This means the derivative $\\frac{dV}{dn}$ (the local sensitivity or slope) decreases as $n$ increases. A decreasing slope is the mathematical definition of saturation or diminishing returns. A linear response would have a constant derivative. Therefore, the model is not only capable of capturing saturation but is specifically designed to do so. The conclusion of the statement is based on a false premise.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. To correct the nonlinearity, the inverse mapping $n(V)=-\\frac{1}{b}\\,\\ln\\left(1-\\frac{V}{a}\\right)$ is used to estimate $n$ from a measured voltage. With $a=0.55$ volts and $b=0.25$ per base, a measured voltage of $V=0.35$ volts corresponds to $n\\approx 4.0$.**\n\nFirst, we check the derivation of the inverse mapping. Starting from $V = a(1-e^{-bn})$, we solve for $n$. As shown in the analysis for option C, this leads to $bn = -\\ln(1 - V/a)$. Dividing by $b$ gives the inverse function:\n$$ n(V) = -\\frac{1}{b} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{V}{a}\\right) $$\nThe formula is correct. Now we apply it to the given values: $V = 0.35$ V, $a = 0.55$ V, and $b = 0.25$ per base.\n$$ n(0.35) = -\\frac{1}{0.25} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{0.35}{0.55}\\right) $$\n$$ n(0.35) = -4 \\times \\ln\\left(1 - 0.63636...\\right) $$\n$$ n(0.35) = -4 \\times \\ln(0.36363...) $$\nUsing a calculator, $\\ln(0.36363...) \\approx -1.0116$.\n$$ n(0.35) \\approx -4 \\times (-1.0116) \\approx 4.0464 $$\nThe calculated value $n \\approx 4.0464$ is indeed approximately $4.0$. This is expected, as the input data point was $V(4) = 0.35$. The calculation confirms the validity of the inverse function and the parameters.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "5160007"}]}
