At any given cycle, a molecule that is currently in-phase will remain in-phase for the next cycle only if it neither phases (with probability $p$) nor prephases (with probability $q$). The probability of an in-phase molecule remaining in-phase is therefore $(1 - p - q)$.\n\nThis leads to a first-order linear recurrence relation for $F_n$:\n$$F_{n+1} = F_n (1 - p - q)$$\nGiven the initial condition $F_0 = 1$, we can solve this geometric progression by induction:\n$F_1 = F_0(1 - p - q) = (1 - p - q)$\n$F_2 = F_1(1 - p - q) = (1 - p - q)^2$\n...\nThe general solution for cycle $n$ is:\n$$F_n = (1 - p - q)^n$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for $P(n)$, the fraction of total intensity observed in the correct channel. The total signal is the sum of contributions from the in-phase and off-phase populations of molecules.\n\n1.  **In-phase contribution:** The fraction of molecules in-phase is $F_n$. These molecules correctly incorporate the nucleotide for cycle $n$, so their entire signal intensity contributes to the correct channel. This contribution is $F_n$.\n\n2.  **Off-phase contribution:** The fraction of molecules that are off-phase is $(1 - F_n)$.

Therefore, on average, a fraction $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the signal from the off-phase population will appear in the correct channel for cycle $n$. This contribution is $\\frac{1}{4}(1 - F_n)$.\n\nThe total fraction of intensity in the correct channel, $P(n)$, is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$P(n) = F_n + \\frac{1}{4}(1 - F_n)$$\nSimplifying this expression:\n$$P(n) = F_n + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4}F_n = \\frac{3}{4}F_n + \\frac{1}{4}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $F_n$ yields the final analytical expression for $P(n)$:\n$$P(n) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}(1 - p - q)^n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must find the smallest integer $n_{\\ast}$ such that $P(n_{\\ast}) < P_{\\text{thr}}$. We are given the values $p = 0.005$, $q = 0.003$, and $P_{\\text{thr}} = 0.6$.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the base of the exponent:\n$1 - p - q = 1 - 0.005 - 0.003 = 0.992$\n\nNow, we set up the inequality:\n$$P(n_{\\ast}) < 0.6$$\n$$\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}(0.992)^{n_{\\ast}} < 0.6$$\nLet's convert the fractions to decimals for calculation:\n$$0.25 + 0.75(0.992)^{n_{\\ast}} < 0.6$$\nNow, we solve for $n_{\\ast}$:\n$$0.75(0.992)^{n_{\\ast}} < 0.6 - 0.25$$\n$$0.75(0.992)^{n_{\\ast}} < 0.35$$\n$$(0.992)^{n_{\\ast}} < \\frac{0.35}{0.75}$$\n$$(0.992)^{n_{\\ast}} < \\frac{35}{75} = \\frac{7}{15}$$\nTo solve for $n_{\\ast}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides.

The standard workflow involves several key steps: first, a library of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) fragments is attached to a glass slide known as a flow cell. These fragments are then amplified in place to form dense clusters of identical DNA molecules. The sequencing process then proceeds in cycles. In each cycle, a mixture of four types of nucleotides (A, C, G, T), each labeled with a unique fluorescent dye and a reversible terminator group, is introduced. A DNA polymerase incorporates exactly one nucleotide into each strand within a cluster. The flow cell is then imaged by a laser-based system that excites the fluorescent dyes. The color of the emission from a cluster identifies which base was incorporated. Finally, a chemical step removes the fluorescent dye and the terminator group, preparing the strands for the next cycle.\n\nDue to a mistake in a synthetic biology experiment, the team accidentally prepared a DNA library composed almost exclusively of long, identical fragments, each consisting of a 150-base-pair poly-adenine sequence (a homopolymer of 150 'A's). They proceed to load this library onto the sequencer and initiate the run. The run quickly fails, yielding unusable data.\n\nWhich of the following options describes the most immediate and fundamental technical reason for the sequencing failure in this specific scenario?\n\nA. The DNA polymerase utilized in the SBS reaction has an intrinsically high error rate for homopolymer regions and rapidly dissociates from the template.\n\nB. The image analysis software, which requires signal diversity across all four fluorescent channels in the early cycles to define the coordinates of each cluster, cannot accurately register the cluster locations.\n\nC. The chemical reaction that cleaves the fluorescent dye and terminator group from the newly added nucleotide becomes progressively less efficient with each consecutive adenine addition, halting the synthesis process.\n\nD. The signal from the single active fluorophore (corresponding to adenine) is so intense that it saturates the optical detector, making it impossible to distinguish any signal from background noise.\n\nE. After approximately 10-15 cycles, the instrument can no longer accurately count the number of incorporated adenines because of signal de-synchronization (phasing) within the clusters.", "solution": "Illumina sequencing-by-synthesis uses reversible terminators so that, in each cycle, at most one nucleotide is incorporated per strand per cluster, followed by imaging in four fluorescent channels and then cleavage of the dye and terminator. Consequently, unlike chemistries that infer homopolymer length from signal amplitude, Illumina is not intrinsically confounded by homopolymers at the enzymatic incorporation step; each cycle yields exactly one base call per cluster.\n\nIn the described scenario, the library consists almost entirely of identical 150-base poly-adenine fragments. Therefore, in the initial cycles, every cluster incorporates the same base (A) and emits fluorescence only in the A channel, cycle after cycle. This produces a complete lack of base diversity across clusters in the early cycles.\n\nIllumina image analysis and base-calling pipelines depend critically on early-cycle base diversity to:\n1) Identify and register cluster coordinates (template generation) by leveraging spatial and spectral variation across channels and cycles to distinguish true cluster spots from background and from each other.\n2) Estimate and correct the color cross-talk matrix and normalize intensities across channels.\n3) Estimate phasing and prephasing parameters.\n\nWhen all clusters emit in only one channel for the early cycles, the software cannot properly perform template generation and calibration steps because there is no multi-channel diversity to resolve cluster positions, compute the color matrix, or robustly track clusters across cycles. This leads to immediate failure of cluster registration and base calling, yielding unusable data at the outset.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: the Illumina SBS polymerase with reversible terminators does not have a uniquely high error rate for homopolymers nor does it rapidly dissociate in this context.\n- B is correct: lack of early-cycle base diversity prevents accurate cluster registration and calibration, causing the run to fail.\n- C is incorrect: the cleavage step does not specifically degrade with consecutive adenines in a way that would immediately halt synthesis.\n- D is incorrect: detector saturation due to a single channel being active is not the limiting factor; per-cluster intensities remain within expected ranges.\n- E is incorrect for Illumina SBS: counting homopolymer length via signal amplitude is not how Illumina works, and while phasing occurs generally, it is not the immediate, fundamental cause of failure here.\n\nTherefore, the most immediate and fundamental technical reason for failure is the inability of the software to register clusters due to the absence of early-cycle base diversity across channels.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2045441"}]}
