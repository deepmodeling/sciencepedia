It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem from the field of biophysical chemistry. The solution will now be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation of the Melting Temperature ($T_m$)\n\nThe formation of the DNA duplex from two non-self-complementary strands, $A$ and $B$, is described by the equilibrium reaction:\n$$A + B \\rightleftharpoons AB$$\nThe equilibrium constant, $K$, for this reaction is given by the ratio of the concentrations at equilibrium:\n$$K = \\frac{[AB]}{[A][B]}$$\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^\\circ$, is related to the equilibrium constant by the fundamental thermodynamic equation:\n$$\\Delta G^\\circ = -RT \\ln K$$\nwhere $R$ is the molar gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature in kelvin. The standard Gibbs free energy change is also related to the standard enthalpy change, $\\Delta H^\\circ$, and the standard entropy change, $\\Delta S^\\circ$, by:\n$$\\Delta G^\\circ = \\Delta H^\\circ - T \\Delta S^\\circ$$\nBy equating these two expressions for $\\Delta G^\\circ$, we obtain:\n$$-RT \\ln K = \\Delta H^\\circ - T \\Delta S^\\circ$$\nSolving for $\\ln K$ yields:\n$$\\ln K = -\\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{RT} + \\frac{\\Delta S^\\circ}{R}$$\nThis equation connects the equilibrium constant to the thermodynamic parameters at a given temperature $T$.\n\nNow, we must evaluate the concentrations at the melting temperature, $T_m$. The problem defines $T_m$ as the temperature at which half of the total strands are in duplex form. The total strand concentration, $C$, is given as the sum of the concentrations of both single strands if no duplexes were formed. Since the strands are mixed equimolarly, the initial total concentrations of strand $A$ and strand $B$ are equal, let's call them $[A]_{total}$ and $[B]_{total}$.\n$$[A]_{total} = [B]_{total} = \\frac{C}{2}$$\nThe total concentration of strands in the system is $[A] + [B] + 2[AB]$, which must equal the initial total strand concentration $C$. At $T_m$, half of these strands are in duplex. The concentration of strands incorporated into the duplex is $2[AB]$. Therefore, at $T = T_m$:\n$$2[AB] = \\frac{1}{2}C \\implies [AB] = \\frac{C}{4}$$\nThe remaining half of the strands are single-stranded, so $[A] + [B] = \\frac{1}{2}C$. Because the strands were added equimolarly and are consumed in a $1:1$ ratio to form the duplex, their free concentrations must be equal at equilibrium: $[A] = [B]$.\nTherefore, at $T=T_m$:\n$$[A] + [A] = \\frac{1}{2}C \\implies 2[A] = \\frac{C}{2} \\implies [A] = \\frac{C}{4}$$\nAnd consequently, $[B] = C/4$.\n\nWe can now substitute these concentrations into the expression for the equilibrium constant at $T=T_m$:\n$$K = \\frac{[AB]}{[A][B]} = \\frac{C/4}{(C/4)(C/4)} = \\frac{4}{C}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $K$ into the thermodynamic relation at $T = T_m$:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{C}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{RT_m} + \\frac{\\Delta S^\\circ}{R}$$\nWe now must solve for $T_m$:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{RT_m} = \\frac{\\Delta S^\\circ}{R} - \\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{C}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{RT_m} = \\frac{\\Delta S^\\circ}{R} + \\ln\\left(\\frac{C}{4}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{1}{T_m} = \\frac{R}{\\Delta H^\\circ} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta S^\\circ}{R} + \\ln\\left(\\frac{C}{4}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta S^\\circ + R \\ln(C/4)}{\\Delta H^\\circ}$$\nFinally, the expression for the melting temperature is:\n$$T_m = \\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{\\Delta S^\\circ + R \\ln(C/4)}$$\nThis is the derived expression for $T_m$ from first principles.\n\nThe main assumption made in this derivation, beyond ideal solution behavior, is that the standard enthalpy ($\\Delta H^\\circ$) and entropy ($\\Delta S^\\circ$) are constant and do not change with temperature over the range considered. This is a standard and reasonable approximation in biophysical chemistry. The problem specifies that the provided thermodynamic parameters are valid for the given ionic conditions, which forms the basis for their direct use in the calculation.\n\n### Numerical Calculation of $T_m$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $\\Delta H^\\circ = -98.2 \\text{ kcal/mol} = -98200 \\text{ cal/mol}$\n- $\\Delta S^\\circ = -270 \\text{ cal/(K·mol)}$\n- $C = 0.25 \\text{ µM} = 0.25 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ M}$\n- $R = 1.987 \\text{ cal/(K·mol)}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the term $R \\ln(C/4)$:\n$$\\frac{C}{4} = \\frac{0.25 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ M}}{4} = 6.25 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ M}$$\n$$R \\ln\\left(\\frac{C}{4}\\right) = (1.987 \\text{ cal/(K·mol)}) \\times \\ln(6.25 \\times 10^{-8})$$\n$$R \\ln\\left(\\frac{C}{4}\\right) \\approx (1.987) \\times (-16.5882) \\text{ cal/(K·mol)} \\approx -32.9624 \\text{ cal/(K·mol)}$$\nNow, we calculate the denominator of the $T_m$ expression:\n$$\\Delta S^\\circ + R \\ln(C/4) = -270 \\text{ cal/(K·mol)} - 32.9624 \\text{ cal/(K·mol)} = -302.9624 \\text{ cal/(K·mol)}$$\nNow, we can calculate $T_m$ in Kelvin:\n$$T_m = \\frac{-98200 \\text{ cal/mol}}{-302.9624 \\text{ cal/(K·mol)}} \\approx 324.134 \\text{ K}$$\nFinally, we convert the temperature to degrees Celsius ($T_{^\\circ C} = T_K - 273.15$):\n$$T_m(^\\circ C) = 324.134 - 273.15 = 50.984 \\,^\\circ\\text{C}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $T_m = 50.98 \\,^\\circ\\text{C}$.\n\n### Discussion of $Mg^{2+}$ Effects\n\nFrom a **polyelectrolyte perspective**, a DNA duplex is a highly charged macromolecule. The sugar-phosphate backbone of each strand carries a periodic arrangement of negative charges from the phosphate groups ($\\text{PO}_4^{-}$). When two strands come together to form a duplex, these negative charges are brought into close proximity, resulting in strong electrostatic repulsion. This repulsion is a major destabilizing force that opposes duplex formation.\n\nCations in the solution, such as the monovalent sodium ion ($Na^+$), act as counterions. They form a diffuse ionic \"cloud\" around the DNA backbone, which shields the negative charges from each other. This **counterion shielding** reduces the electrostatic repulsion between the strands, thus stabilizing the duplex.\n\nWhen replacing monovalent $Na^+$ with divalent magnesium ions ($Mg^{2+}$), the stabilizing effect is significantly enhanced. There are two primary reasons for this:\n1.  **Higher Charge:** A single $Mg^{2+}$ ion carries twice the positive charge of a $Na^+$ ion, making it much more effective at neutralizing the negative charge of the phosphate backbone.\n2.  **Higher Charge Density:** $Mg^{2+}$ generally has a smaller effective ionic radius than $Na^+$, leading to a higher charge density. This allows it to interact more strongly and closely with the phosphate groups. It has been shown that $Mg^{2+}$ can form both outer-sphere (hydrated) and inner-sphere (direct) coordination complexes with the phosphate oxygens, leading to exceptionally efficient charge neutralization.\n\nFrom a **thermodynamic perspective**, this enhanced stabilization means that the free energy of duplex formation, $\\Delta G^\\circ$, becomes more negative (more favorable) in the presence of $Mg^{2+}$ compared to an equimolar concentration of $Na^+$. Since $\\Delta G^\\circ = \\Delta H^\\circ - T\\Delta S^\\circ$, a more stable duplex requires more thermal energy to dissociate. The melting temperature, $T_m$, is the point where the duplex dissociates. Therefore, due to the superior electrostatic shielding provided by $Mg^{2+}$, the $T_m$ of the DNA duplex will **increase**. A higher temperature will be required to provide sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the combined forces of hydrogen bonding and the now more effectively shielded electrostatic interactions holding the duplex together.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{50.98}$$", "id": "5088962"}, {"introduction": "Once individual primer pairs are designed, the next challenge is to strategically arrange amplicons to ensure complete and redundant coverage of all target regions.

This is true by our assumption, so $N=1$ is the minimal solution if $L \\le A$.\n\nIf $L > A$, we need more than one amplicon.

The parameter $\\lambda$ of the Poisson distribution is given by the mean of the binomial distribution, $\\lambda = np$.\n- Under the null: $K_{\\text{null}} \\approx \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_0)$, where $\\lambda_0 = np_0 = \\frac{n}{3000}$.\n- Under the alternative: $K_{\\text{alt}} \\approx \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_1)$, where $\\lambda_1 = np_1 = n \\frac{799}{150000}$.\n\nThis approximation is justified because $n$ is expected to be large (in the thousands), while $p_0 \\approx 3.33 \\times 10^{-4}$ and $p_1 \\approx 5.33 \\times 10^{-3}$ are small, making the conditions for the Poisson approximation ideal.\n\n**3. Formulating the Constraints**\nThe two constraints on the threshold $T$ can be written using the Poisson approximation. Let $F(k; \\lambda)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$, i.e., $F(k; \\lambda) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda)\\lambda^i}{i!}$. The survival function (SF) is $\\Pr(K \\ge T) = 1 - F(T-1; \\lambda)$.\n\n-   **Constraint 1 (Specificity):** $\\Pr(K \\geq T \\mid \\text{null}) < 10^{-4}$\n    $$1 - F(T-1; \\lambda_0) < 10^{-4} \\implies F(T-1; \\lambda_0) > 0.9999$$\n-   **Constraint 2 (Sensitivity):** $\\Pr(K \\geq T \\mid \\text{alternative}) \\geq 0.95$\n    $$1 - F(T-1; \\lambda_1) \\geq 0.95 \\implies F(T-1; \\lambda_1) \\leq 0.05$$\n\nFor a given depth $n$, we must find if there exists an integer $T$ that satisfies both inequalities. This means the set of allowed integers $T$ for each constraint must have a non-empty intersection.\nLet $T_1$ be the minimum integer threshold satisfying Constraint 1.\nLet $T_2$ be the maximum integer threshold satisfying Constraint 2.\nAn integer threshold $T$ can be chosen if and only if $T_1 \\le T_2$. Our goal is to find the minimum integer $n$ for which this condition holds.\n\n**4. Numerical Search for Minimum $n$**\nWe need to find the smallest integer $n$ such that there exists an integer $T$ satisfying both conditions. We can systematically search for this minimum $n$.\n\nLet's test $n=1973$:\n- $\\lambda_0 = np_0 = 1973 \\times \\frac{1}{3000} \\approx 0.65767$\n- $\\lambda_1 = np_1 = 1973 \\times \\frac{799}{150000} \\approx 10.5073$\n\nFor Constraint 1: We need to find the smallest integer $T$ such that $\\Pr(K \\ge T | \\lambda_0) < 10^{-4}$.\n- For $T=5$: $\\Pr(K \\ge 5 | \\lambda_0) \\approx 1.77 \\times 10^{-4}$, which is not less than $10^{-4}$.\n- For $T=6$: $\\Pr(K \\ge 6 | \\lambda_0) \\approx 2.14 \\times 10^{-5}$, which is less than $10^{-4}$.\nSo, the minimum threshold allowed by Constraint 1 is $T_1 = 6$.\n\nFor Constraint 2: We need to find the largest integer $T$ such that $\\Pr(K \\ge T | \\lambda_1) \\ge 0.95$.\n- For $T=5$: $\\Pr(K \\ge 5 | \\lambda_1) \\approx 0.9768 \\ge 0.95$. This is a valid choice.\n- For $T=6$: $\\Pr(K \\ge 6 | \\lambda_1) \\approx 0.94998 < 0.95$. This is not a valid choice.\nSo, the maximum threshold allowed by Constraint 2 is $T_2 = 5$.\n\nFor $n=1973$, we require a threshold $T$ such that $T \\ge T_1 = 6$ and $T \\le T_2 = 5$. This is impossible. Thus, $n=1973$ is not sufficient.\n\nNow let's analyze $n=1974$:\n- $\\lambda_0 = np_0 = 1974 \\times \\frac{1}{3000} = 0.658$\n- $\\lambda_1 = np_1 = 1974 \\times \\frac{799}{150000} \\approx 10.5126$\n\nFor Constraint 1: We seek the smallest $T$ with $\\Pr(K \\ge T | \\lambda_0) < 10^{-4}$.\n- For $T=5$: $\\Pr(K \\ge 5 | \\lambda_0) \\approx 1.79 \\times 10^{-4} > 10^{-4}$.\n- For $T=6$: $\\Pr(K \\ge 6 | \\lambda_0) \\approx 2.15 \\times 10^{-5} < 10^{-4}$.\nThe minimum threshold allowed is $T_1 = 6$.\n\nFor Constraint 2: We seek the largest $T$ with $\\Pr(K \\ge T | \\lambda_1) \\ge 0.95$.\n- For $T=6$: $\\Pr(K \\ge 6 | \\lambda_1) \\approx 0.9501 \\ge 0.95$. This is a valid choice.\n- For $T=7$: $\\Pr(K \\ge 7 | \\lambda_1) \\approx 0.8996 < 0.95$. This is not a valid choice.\nThe maximum threshold allowed is $T_2 = 6$.\n\nFor $n=1974$, we require a threshold $T$ such that $T \\ge T_1 = 6$ and $T \\le T_2 = 6$. A valid threshold exists, namely $T=6$.\n\nSince $n=1973$ is insufficient and $n=1974$ is sufficient, the minimum integer sequencing depth required is $1974$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1974}$$", "id": "5088999"}]}
