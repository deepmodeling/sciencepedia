The formation of droplets from a liquid jet is a real physical phenomenon, and using a piezoelectric transducer to control the breakup frequency is the standard operating principle for droplet-based microfluidic devices like FACS instruments. The specified unstable wavelength, $\\lambda^{\\ast} \\approx 4.508\\,D$, corresponds to the theoretical result for an inviscid liquid jet, which is a common and valid approximation in this context. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data and relationships to derive the required expressions and compute the numerical values. The givens ($D$, $v$, and the relation for $\\lambda^{\\ast}$) are sufficient to uniquely determine the droplet volume $V_d$ and the generation rate $f$. The task is clearly defined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It is free from subjective or opinion-based assertions.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The provided definitions for $Q$, $A$, and $V_d$ are mutually consistent and sufficient for the required derivations. There are no contradictions.\n- **Realism**: The given parameters, $D = 70\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $v = 10\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, are realistic values for a high-speed cell sorter.\n- **Structure**: The problem is well-structured, requesting derivations first, followed by numerical calculations and a verification step. This logical flow admits a unique and meaningful solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe task is to derive expressions for droplet volume $V_d$ and droplet generation rate $f$, compute their numerical values, and verify mass conservation.\n\n**1. Derivation of Droplet Volume ($V_d$)**\nThe problem states that one droplet is formed per wavelength $\\lambda^{\\ast}$, and the volume of this droplet is equal to the volume of the cylindrical segment of the jet with length $\\lambda^{\\ast}$. The cross-sectional area of the jet is given as $A = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}$.\n\nThe droplet volume $V_d$ is therefore:\n$$V_d = A \\lambda^{\\ast}$$\nGiven the relation for the most unstable wavelength, $\\lambda^{\\ast} \\approx 4.508\\,D$, we substitute this and the expression for $A$ into the volume equation:\n$$V_d = \\left(\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\right) (4.508\\,D)$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the droplet volume in terms of the jet diameter $D$:\n$$V_d = \\frac{4.508\\,\\pi D^3}{4} \\approx 1.127\\,\\pi D^3$$\nNote that the droplet volume $V_d$ is a function of the jet diameter $D$ only and is independent of the jet speed $v$.\n\n**2. Derivation of Droplet Generation Rate ($f$)**\nThe droplet generation rate, or frequency $f$, is the number of droplets produced per unit time. Since one droplet is formed from a segment of jet of length $\\lambda^{\\ast}$ traveling at a uniform speed $v$, the time period $T$ for the formation of one droplet is the time it takes for this length of jet to pass a fixed point.\n$$T = \\frac{\\lambda^{\\ast}}{v}$$\nThe frequency $f$ is the reciprocal of the period $T$:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{v}{\\lambda^{\\ast}}$$\nSubstituting $\\lambda^{\\ast} \\approx 4.508\\,D$, we obtain the expression for the frequency in terms of $v$ and $D$:\n$$f = \\frac{v}{4.508\\,D}$$\n\n**3. Numerical Computations**\nWe are given the values $D = 70\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $v = 10\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$. We must use consistent SI units for calculations.\n$D = 70 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$v = 10\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n\nFirst, we compute the droplet volume $V_d$:\n$$V_d = \\frac{4.508\\,\\pi (70 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}{4} = \\frac{4.508\\,\\pi (343000 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3)}{4}$$\n$$V_d = \\frac{4.508\\,\\pi (3.43 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3)}{4} \\approx 1.2142 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3$$\n\nNext, we compute the droplet generation rate $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}{4.508 \\times (70 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{10}{315.56 \\times 10^{-6}}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n$$f \\approx 31689.69\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\n\n**4. Verification of Mass Conservation**\nThe problem asks to verify that the volumetric flow rate $Q$ is equal to the product of the droplet volume $V_d$ and the generation frequency $f$. This is equivalent to checking if $Q = V_d f$. We perform this verification symbolically using the derived expressions, which is more rigorous than using rounded numerical values.\n\nThe volumetric flow rate is defined as $Q = A v$.\nFrom our derivations, we have $V_d = A \\lambda^{\\ast}$ and $f = \\frac{v}{\\lambda^{\\ast}}$.\nTheir product is:\n$$V_d f = (A \\lambda^{\\ast}) \\left(\\frac{v}{\\lambda^{\\ast}}\\right)$$\nThe term $\\lambda^{\\ast}$ cancels out:\n$$V_d f = A v$$\nSince $Q = A v$ by definition, we have proven that $Q = V_d f$. This confirms that the volume of fluid flowing through the nozzle per unit time is equal to the total volume of droplets generated per unit time, thus satisfying the principle of mass (or volume, for an incompressible fluid) conservation.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\nThe problem requests the vibration frequency $f$ in $\\mathrm{Hz}$, rounded to four significant figures.\nThe calculated value is $f \\approx 31689.69\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $31690\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nIn standard scientific notation, this is $3.169 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.169 \\times 10^4}$$", "id": "5116628"}, {"introduction": "While a sorter can generate droplets at an astonishing rate, the ultimate throughput is limited by a fundamental statistical challenge: ensuring that each droplet contains at most one cell.
