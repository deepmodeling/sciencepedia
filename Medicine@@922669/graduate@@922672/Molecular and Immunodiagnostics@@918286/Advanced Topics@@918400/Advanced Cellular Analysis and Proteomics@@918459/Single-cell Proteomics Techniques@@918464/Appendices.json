The analysis will be performed on the natural logarithm scale.\n\nLet $X_{1,i}$ and $X_{2,i}$ be the log-transformed protein abundances for cell $i$ in group $1$ and group $2$, respectively. Based on the problem statement, these are modeled as independent random variables from normal distributions:\n$$X_{1,i} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1, \\sigma^2) \\quad \\text{for } i = 1, \\dots, n$$\n$$X_{2,i} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_2, \\sigma^2) \\quad \\text{for } i = 1, \\dots, n$$\nThe null hypothesis $H_0$ is that there is no difference in mean abundance, while the alternative hypothesis $H_1$ is that there is a difference. On the log scale, this is a test on the means:\n$$H_0: \\mu_2 - \\mu_1 = 0$$\n$$H_1: \\mu_2 - \\mu_1 \\neq 0$$\n\nThe effect size is the difference in means under the alternative hypothesis, $\\delta = \\mu_2 - \\mu_1$. A $1.5$-fold change on the linear scale corresponds to a difference of $\\delta = \\ln(1.5)$ on the log scale.\n\nThe variance, $\\sigma^2$, is determined by the linear-scale coefficient of variation $c = 0.30$:\n$$\\sigma^2 = \\ln(1 + c^2) = \\ln(1 + 0.30^2) = \\ln(1.09)$$\n\nLet $\\bar{X}_1$ and $\\bar{X}_2$ be the sample means for each group. The test statistic is based on the difference in sample means, $\\bar{D} = \\bar{X}_2 - \\bar{X}_1$. The variance of this difference is:\n$$\\text{Var}(\\bar{D}) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_2) + \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_1) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}$$\nUsing the normal approximation, the test statistic is a Z-statistic:\n$$Z = \\frac{\\bar{D} - (\\mu_2 - \\mu_1)}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}}$$\nUnder $H_0$, $\\mu_2 - \\mu_1 = 0$, so $Z = \\frac{\\bar{D}}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\nUnder $H_1$, the mean of $\\bar{D}$ is $\\delta$, so $Z = \\frac{\\bar{D}}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}}$ follows a shifted normal distribution:\n$$Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}}, 1\\right)$$\n\nThe per-test significance level for a two-sided test is $\\alpha_{\\text{per-test}} = q/m = 0.05 / 3000$. We reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ if the absolute value of the observed test statistic exceeds the critical value $z_{\\alpha_{\\text{per-test}}/2}$, where $z_{\\alpha_{\\text{per-test}}/2}$ is the upper $(\\alpha_{\\text{per-test}}/2)$-quantile of the standard normal distribution.\n\nStatistical power, $1-\\beta$, is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when $H_1$ is true.\n$$1 - \\beta = P(|Z| > z_{\\alpha_{\\text{per-test}}/2} \\mid H_1)$$\nGiven $\\delta = \\ln(1.5) > 0$, the mean of the test statistic under $H_1$ is positive. Consequently, the probability of rejection is dominated by the upper tail of the distribution, and the term $P(Z  -z_{\\alpha_{\\text{per-test}}/2} \\mid H_1)$ is negligible. Thus, we can approximate the power as:\n$$1 - \\beta \\approx P(Z  z_{\\alpha_{\\text{per-test}}/2} \\mid H_1)$$\nLet $Z_{std} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. Under $H_1$, the test statistic $Z$ can be written as $Z = Z_{std} + \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}}$. Substituting this into the power expression:\n$$1 - \\beta \\approx P\\left(Z_{std} + \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}}  z_{\\alpha_{\\text{per-test}}/2}\\right) = P\\left(Z_{std}  z_{\\alpha_{\\text{per-test}}/2} - \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}}\\right)$$\nBy definition of the standard normal quantile $z_p$, $P(Z_{std} > z_p) = 1-p$. So, we require the argument of the probability function to be equal to $z_{\\beta}$, where $P(Z_{std} > z_{\\beta})=1-\\beta$.\n$$z_{\\beta} = z_{\\alpha_{\\text{per-test}}/2} - \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}}$$\nUsing the symmetry of the normal distribution, $z_{\\beta} = -z_{1-\\beta}$.\n$$-z_{1-\\beta} = z_{\\alpha_{\\text{per-test}}/2} - \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}}$$\nRearranging for the effect size term (and using $|\\delta|$ for generality) yields the standard power equation:\n$$\\frac{|\\delta|}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2/n}} = z_{\\alpha_{\\text{per-test}}/2} + z_{1-\\beta}$$\nSolving for $n$:\n$$\\sqrt{n} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2}}{|\\delta|} (z_{\\alpha_{\\text{per-test}}/2} + z_{1-\\beta})$$\n$$n = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{\\delta^2} (z_{\\alpha_{\\text{per-test}}/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n- $\\delta = \\ln(1.5)$\n- $\\sigma^2 = \\ln(1.09)$\n- $\\alpha_{\\text{per-test}} = 0.05 / 3000$, so the critical value corresponds to a tail probability of $\\alpha_{\\text{per-test}}/2 = 0.05 / 6000$.\n- $1 - \\beta = 0.80$, so we need the quantile $z_{1-0.20} = z_{0.80}$.\n\nWe find the required quantiles (z-scores) from the standard normal distribution:\n- $z_{1-\\beta} = z_{0.80} \\approx 0.84162$\n- The critical value $z_{\\alpha_{\\text{per-test}}/2}$ corresponds to the quantile $1 - \\alpha_{\\text{per-test}}/2 = 1 - (0.05/6000)$.\n$z_{1 - 0.05/6000} \\approx z_{0.99999167} \\approx 4.30703$\n\nNow we compute $n$:\n$$n = \\frac{2 \\ln(1.09)}{(\\ln(1.5))^2} (4.30703 + 0.84162)^2$$\n$$n = \\frac{2 \\ln(1.09)}{(\\ln(1.5))^2} (5.14865)^2$$\nCalculating the terms:\n- $2 \\ln(1.09) \\approx 2 \\times 0.086178 \\approx 0.172356$\n- $(\\ln(1.5))^2 \\approx (0.405465)^2 \\approx 0.164402$\n- $(5.14865)^2 \\approx 26.5086$\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $n$:\n$$n \\approx \\frac{0.172356}{0.164402} \\times 26.5086$$\n$$n \\approx 1.04838 \\times 26.5086 \\approx 27.7919$$\nSince the number of cells, $n$, must be an integer, we round up to the next integer to ensure the power is at least the target level of $0.80$.\n$$n = \\lceil 27.7919 \\rceil = 28$$\nTherefore, a minimum of $28$ single cells per group is required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{28}$$", "id": "5162388"}, {"introduction": "A primary challenge in single-cell proteomics is the minute amount of starting material, where every molecule counts.

The intensity values and number of peptide identifications are within a plausible range for such experiments.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is therefore **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to distinguish between a global instrument effect and a sample preparation effect. The bridge/reference channel is the key diagnostic tool for this purpose. By design, the amount of sample in the bridge channel is constant across runs. Therefore, any change in its measured intensity, $I_B$, must be attributable to a change in overall instrument sensitivity.\n\nFirst, let's quantify the change in intensity for the bridge/reference channel from Run X to Run Y. We calculate the ratio of the median intensities:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{B,Y}}{I_{B,X}} = \\frac{6.2 \\times 10^{4}}{1.0 \\times 10^{5}} = 0.62\n$$\nThis result indicates that the intensity measured for the constant-load bridge channel in Run Y was $62\\%$ of that in Run X. According to principle #4, this suggests a global instrument sensitivity loss of approximately $38\\%$ ($1 - 0.62 = 0.38$).\n\nIf this is a global instrument effect, it should affect all channels proportionally. We should therefore expect a similar reduction in the intensity of the single-cell channels. Let's calculate the ratio of the median intensities for the single-cell channels:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{S,Y}}{I_{S,X}} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{4}}{3.2 \\times 10^{4}} = \\frac{2.0}{3.2} = 0.625\n$$\nThe intensity of the single-cell channels in Run Y is $62.5\\%$ of that in Run X. This value is nearly identical to the $62\\%$ observed for the bridge channel. The fact that both channel types experienced the same proportional decrease in signal intensity is strong evidence for a common-mode cause that scales all signals, which is the definition of a change in instrument sensitivity.\n\nFinally, let's examine the effect on peptide identifications. According to principle #2, $\\mathrm{SNR} \\propto \\sqrt{I}$. Therefore, the ratio of SNRs between the runs should be:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{SNR}_Y}{\\mathrm{SNR}_X} \\propto \\frac{\\sqrt{I_Y}}{\\sqrt{I_X}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{I_Y}{I_X}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.625} \\approx 0.79\n$$\nSo, the SNR in Run Y is approximately $79\\%$ of the SNR in Run X. According to principle #3, a decrease in SNR is expected to lead to a decrease in the number of peptide identifications. The observed ratio of identifications is:\n$$\n\\frac{N_Y}{N_X} = \\frac{3600}{5000} = 0.72\n$$\nThe number of identifications dropped to $72\\%$ of the original value. This significant drop is directionally consistent with the calculated drop in SNR, further corroborating the hypothesis of a global sensitivity loss.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. Instrument sensitivity loss between runs caused a global decrease in reporter ion intensities and identifications.**\nThis explanation posits a global effect that should impact both the bridge and single-cell channels proportionally. As calculated above, the intensity ratio for the bridge channel ($0.62$) and the single-cell channels ($0.625$) are almost identical. This matches the expectation for a global sensitivity loss. The concurrent drop in peptide identifications is also consistent with the resulting lower SNR. This option aligns perfectly with all the provided data and principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Single-cell sample preparation variance reduced peptide yield only in single-cell channels while the instrument sensitivity remained constant.**\nThis hypothesis states that the effect is specific to single-cell sample preparation and that instrument sensitivity was constant. If true, the bridge channel intensity should have remained constant ($I_{B,Y} \\approx I_{B,X}$). However, the data show a substantial decrease in the bridge channel intensity from $I_{B,X} = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}$ to $I_{B,Y} = 6.2 \\times 10^{4}$. This directly contradicts the premise that instrument sensitivity was constant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Isobaric reporter crosstalk redistributed reporter ion signal among tags without changing total reporter ion signal or identifications.**\nThis option is incorrect on two counts. First, it claims that total reporter ion signal does not change. The data clearly show that the median intensities for *both* channel types decreased significantly. Second, it claims that the number of identifications does not change. The data show a drop from $N_{X} = 5000$ to $N_{Y} = 3600$. This explanation is inconsistent with the primary observations from the data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Incorrect isolation of monoisotopic peaks led to ratio compression exclusively in single-cell channels, leaving the bridge/reference channel unchanged.**\nThis option claims the effect is exclusive to single-cell channels and that the bridge channel is unchanged. Similar to option B, this is directly refuted by the data, which shows a significant drop in the bridge channel's signal intensity. Ratio compression is an effect on relative quantification between channels, and does not in itself explain a global drop in absolute intensities and total peptide identifications.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis of the provided data in the context of the given principles, the only explanation that is fully consistent with the observations is a loss of instrument sensitivity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5162342"}]}
