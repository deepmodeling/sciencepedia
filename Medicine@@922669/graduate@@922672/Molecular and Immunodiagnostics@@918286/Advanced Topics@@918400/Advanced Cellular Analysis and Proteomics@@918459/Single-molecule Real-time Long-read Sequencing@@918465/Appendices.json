This exercise guides you through the fundamental calculation of sequencing coverage, which is the average number of times each base in a target region is sequenced. By deriving and applying the classic formula, $C = \\frac{NL}{G}$, you will connect the number of reads ($N$), mean read length ($L$), and target region size ($G$) to the expected coverage ($C$), providing a quantitative basis for experimental design [@problem_id:5163228].", "problem": "A clinical immunogenomics laboratory plans to use Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) long-read sequencing to characterize the extended Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) region. Let the target region length be $G$ base pairs. Define the expected coverage $C$ at a randomly chosen base as the expected number of sequenced bases overlapping that base, under the standard assumptions that read starts are uniformly distributed over the region and that edge effects can be neglected because $G \\gg L$, where $L$ is the mean read length.

Express your answer in hours.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The parameters provided are realistic for the described application in immunogenomics. I will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we must derive an expression for the expected coverage $C$ as a function of the number of reads $N$, the mean read length $L$, and the target region length $G$. Second, we must use this expression to calculate the required instrument runtime to achieve a specific target coverage $C^{\\star}$.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Expected Coverage Formula\n\nLet the target region be represented by the interval $[0, G]$. Consider an arbitrary base at a position $x$ within this region. We are asked to find the expected number of reads that cover this position $x$. This is the definition of expected coverage, $C$.\n\nLet there be $N$ total reads. Let's consider a single read, indexed by $i$, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., N\\}$. This read has a length $L_i$. The problem states that the mean read length is $L$, which means $L = E[L_i] = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} L_i$.\n\nThe starting position of read $i$, denoted by $s_i$, is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the target region. Given the assumption that edge effects are negligible ($G \\gg L$), we can model the start positions as being uniformly distributed over the interval $[0, G]$.\n\nFor read $i$ to cover the base at position $x$, its start position $s_i$ must fall within the interval $[x - L_i + 1, x]$. The length of this interval of valid starting positions is $L_i$. The probability, $p_i$, that a randomly chosen start position $s_i$ falls within this interval is the ratio of the length of the valid interval to the length of the total possible interval for start positions.\n$$p_i = P(\\text{read } i \\text{ covers } x) = \\frac{L_i}{G}$$\n\nLet us define an indicator random variable $I_i$ for each read:\n$$I_i = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if read } i \\text{ covers position } x \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\nThe expected value of this indicator variable is the probability that the event occurs:\n$$E[I_i] = 1 \\cdot P(I_i=1) + 0 \\cdot P(I_i=0) = P(I_i=1) = p_i = \\frac{L_i}{G}$$\n\nThe total coverage at position $x$, denoted $C_x$, is the sum of the indicator variables for all $N$ reads:\n$$C_x = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} I_i$$\nThe expected coverage, $C$, is the expectation of $C_x$. Using the linearity of expectation, which allows us to write the expectation of a sum as the sum of expectations, we have:\n$$C = E[C_x] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} I_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[I_i]$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E[I_i]$:\n$$C = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{L_i}{G} = \\frac{1}{G} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} L_i$$\nWe know that the total number of sequenced bases is $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} L_i$. This sum can be expressed in terms of the mean read length $L$ and the total number of reads $N$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} L_i = N \\cdot L$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $C$, we arrive at the required formula:\n$$C = \\frac{N L}{G}$$\nThis expression relates the expected coverage $C$ to the number of reads $N$, the mean read length $L$, and the genome or region length $G$.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Required Runtime\n\nThe goal is to achieve a target expected coverage of $C^{\\star} = 47$ on a region of length $G = 3.9 \\times 10^{6}$ base pairs. The sequencing process yields a mean read length of $L = 1.8 \\times 10^{4}$ base pairs.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of *usable, on-target* reads, let's call this $N_{\\text{usable}}$, required to achieve the coverage $C^{\\star}$. Using the formula we just derived:\n$$C^{\\star} = \\frac{N_{\\text{usable}} L}{G}$$\nRearranging to solve for $N_{\\text{usable}}$:\n$$N_{\\text{usable}} = \\frac{C^{\\star} G}{L}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$N_{\\text{usable}} = \\frac{47 \\cdot (3.9 \\times 10^{6})}{(1.8 \\times 10^{4})} = \\frac{183.3 \\times 10^{6}}{1.8 \\times 10^{4}} = 101.833... \\times 10^{2} = 10183.33...$$\nSo, approximately $10183$ usable reads are required.\n\nNext, we must determine the rate at which these usable reads are generated. The instrument produces a total of $r_{N} = 2.5 \\times 10^{4}$ polymerase reads per hour. However, only a fraction $f_{u} = 0.51$ of these are usable and on-target. The effective rate of usable read generation, $r_{\\text{usable}}$, is therefore:\n$$r_{\\text{usable}} = r_{N} \\cdot f_{u} = (2.5 \\times 10^{4} \\text{ reads/hour}) \\cdot 0.51 = 12750 \\text{ reads/hour}$$\n\nThe total runtime, $T$, is the total number of usable reads required divided by the rate at which they are generated:\n$$T = \\frac{N_{\\text{usable}}}{r_{\\text{usable}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N_{\\text{usable}}$ and $r_{\\text{usable}}$:\n$$T = \\frac{C^{\\star} G / L}{r_{N} f_{u}} = \\frac{C^{\\star} G}{L r_{N} f_{u}}$$\nNow, we plug in all the numerical values:\n$$T = \\frac{47 \\cdot (3.9 \\times 10^{6})}{(1.8 \\times 10^{4}) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{4}) \\cdot 0.51}$$\n$$T = \\frac{1.833 \\times 10^{8}}{(1.8 \\times 10^{4}) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{4}) \\cdot 0.51} = \\frac{1.833 \\times 10^{8}}{(4.5 \\times 10^{8}) \\cdot 0.51} = \\frac{1.833 \\times 10^{8}}{2.295 \\times 10^{8}}$$\n$$T = \\frac{1.833}{2.295} \\approx 0.7986928... \\text{ hours}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final runtime to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant digit is $9$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$T \\approx 0.7987 \\text{ hours}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7987}$$", "id": "5163228"}, {"introduction": "A key innovation of SMRT sequencing is the ability to generate highly accurate long reads, known as HiFi reads, from an inherently noisy single-molecule process.

First, the derivation of an analytic expression for the consensus error rate, $p_c$. Second, the calculation of the minimal number of passes, $n$, to meet a specified quality threshold.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the analytic expression for $p_c$.\n\nThe process of determining the base at a single genomic position across $n$ independent passes can be modeled as a sequence of $n$ Bernoulli trials. For each trial (pass), there are two outcomes: an incorrect base call (an \"error\") or a correct base call (a \"success\" in terms of getting the right base).\n\nLet $p$ be the probability of an incorrect base call for any single pass. This is given as $0 < p < \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe probability of a correct base call is consequently $1-p$.\n\nLet $K$ be the random variable representing the total number of incorrect base calls over the $n$ independent passes. As the passes are independent and the probability of error $p$ is constant for each, $K$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n$ (the number of trials) and $p$ (the probability of an error on each trial). This is denoted as $K \\sim B(n, p)$.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) of $K$ is given by the binomial formula:\n$$P(K=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\nwhere $k$ is an integer representing the number of incorrect calls, $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nA consensus error occurs if the majority of the passes report an incorrect base. The number of incorrect calls is $k$ and the number of correct calls is $n-k$. A majority of incorrect calls means that $k > n-k$, which simplifies to $2k > n$, or $k > \\frac{n}{2}$.\n\nThe problem specifies that $n$ is an odd integer. Let $n = 2m+1$ for some non-negative integer $m$. The condition for an error becomes $k > \\frac{2m+1}{2} = m + \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $k$ must be an integer, the smallest integer value of $k$ that satisfies this inequality is $m+1$. Substituting $m = \\frac{n-1}{2}$, the condition for a consensus error is $k \\ge \\frac{n-1}{2} + 1 = \\frac{n+1}{2}$.\n\nThe consensus error rate, $p_c$, is the total probability of all outcomes where the consensus is incorrect. This is the probability that $K$ is greater than or equal to $\\frac{n+1}{2}$. We can express this by summing the probabilities for all relevant values of $k$:\n$$p_c(n, p) = P(K \\ge \\frac{n+1}{2}) = \\sum_{k=\\frac{n+1}{2}}^{n} P(K=k)$$\nSubstituting the PMF of the binomial distribution, we arrive at the final analytic expression for $p_c$:\n$$p_c(n, p) = \\sum_{k=\\frac{n+1}{2}}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\n\nPart 2: Determination of the minimal odd integer $n$.\n\nWe are given the per-pass error rate $p = 0.15$ and a target Phred Quality Value $QV^{\\ast} = 30$. The quality value is defined as $QV = -10\\log_{10}(p_c)$. The laboratory requires the consensus quality to be at least this target value, so we must have $QV \\ge QV^{\\ast}$.\n$$-10\\log_{10}(p_c) \\ge 30$$\nDividing by $-10$ reverses the inequality:\n$$\\log_{10}(p_c) \\le -3$$\nApplying the exponential function to both sides (base $10$):\n$$p_c \\le 10^{-3}$$\nSo, we must find the minimal odd integer $n$ such that the consensus error rate is no more than $0.001$. With $p=0.15$, the probability of a correct pass is $1-p = 0.85$. The inequality to solve is:\n$$p_c(n) = \\sum_{k=\\frac{n+1}{2}}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} (0.15)^k (0.85)^{n-k} \\le 0.001$$\nSince $p=0.15 < 0.5$, increasing the number of passes $n$ will decrease the probability of a majority error. Thus, $p_c(n)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $n$. We can find the minimal $n$ by testing successive odd integers.\n\nFor $n=1$, $p_c(1) = 0.15$, which is greater than $0.001$.\nFor $n=3$, $p_c(3) \\approx 0.06075$, which is greater than $0.001$.\nWe continue testing for $n=5, 7, 9, 11, \\dots$.

A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the expressions for the error probabilities and expected error counts, and then applying them to the specific run-length distribution provided.\n\n**1. Deletion Probability and Expected Deletion Errors**\n\nA deletion error occurs when two successive incorporation pulses are not resolved, which happens if the time between them is less than or equal to the resolution threshold $\\Delta$. The waiting time $T$ between incorporations is exponentially distributed with rate $\\kappa$. The probability density function is $f(t) = \\kappa \\exp(-\\kappa t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThe probability that a single inter-pulse interval is unresolved, which we denote as $p$, is the probability that the waiting time $T$ is less than or equal to $\\Delta$:\n$$p = P(T \\le \\Delta) = \\int_0^{\\Delta} \\kappa \\exp(-\\kappa t) \\, dt = [-\\exp(-\\kappa t)]_0^{\\Delta} = 1 - \\exp(-\\kappa \\Delta)$$\n\nA homopolymer of length $h$ consists of $h$ identical base incorporations. For $h \\ge 2$, there are $h-1$ inter-pulse intervals between these $h$ incorporations. The waiting times for each interval are independent.\n\nThe deletion probability $p_d(h)$ is the probability of at least one unresolved interval among the $h-1$ intervals. It is simpler to calculate the complement: the probability that all $h-1$ intervals are resolved. The probability of a single interval being resolved is $1-p = \\exp(-\\kappa\\Delta)$. Since the intervals are independent, the probability that all $h-1$ intervals are resolved is $(1-p)^{h-1} = (\\exp(-\\kappa\\Delta))^{h-1} = \\exp(-\\kappa\\Delta(h-1))$.\n\nTherefore, the deletion probability for a homopolymer of length $h \\ge 2$ is:\n$$p_d(h) = 1 - (1-p)^{h-1} = 1 - \\exp(-\\kappa\\Delta(h-1))$$\nFor a homopolymer of length $h=1$, there are no inter-pulse intervals, so no deletion error of this type can occur. Thus, $p_d(1) = 0$. Note that the formula correctly yields $p_d(1) = 1-\\exp(0) = 0$.\n\nNext, we derive the expected number of deletion errors, $E_d(h)$, for a homopolymer of length $h$. Let $X_j$ be an indicator variable for the $j$-th interval (where $j=1, \\dots, h-1$), such that $X_j=1$ if the interval is unresolved and $X_j=0$ otherwise. The total number of deletion errors is $D_h = \\sum_{j=1}^{h-1} X_j$.\nBy linearity of expectation, the expected number of deletions is:\n$$E_d(h) = E[D_h] = E\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{h-1} X_j\\right] = \\sum_{j=1}^{h-1} E[X_j]$$\nThe expectation of an indicator variable is the probability of the event it indicates: $E[X_j] = P(X_j=1) = p = 1-\\exp(-\\kappa\\Delta)$.\nThus, for $h \\ge 1$:\n$$E_d(h) = (h-1)p = (h-1)(1 - \\exp(-\\kappa\\Delta))$$\nThis formula correctly gives $E_d(1)=0$.\n\n**2. Expected Insertion Errors**\n\nInsertion errors arise from spurious pulses, which are modeled as a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $\\lambda_s$. The expected number of spurious pulses in a given time period $\\tau$ is $\\lambda_s \\tau$.\nThe synthesis of a homopolymer of length $h$ takes a total time $T_h = \\sum_{j=1}^{h} T_j$, where each $T_j$ is an independent exponential random variable with rate $\\kappa$. The total time $T_h$ is a random variable. The expected total time is:\n$$E[T_h] = E\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{h} T_j\\right] = \\sum_{j=1}^{h} E[T_j] = \\sum_{j=1}^{h} \\frac{1}{\\kappa} = \\frac{h}{\\kappa}$$\nThe expected number of insertion errors, $E_i(h)$, during the synthesis of a homopolymer of length $h$ is the expected number of spurious pulses occurring during the random time interval $T_h$. Using the law of total expectation:\n$$E_i(h) = E[\\text{Number of spurious pulses in time } T_h] = E[E[\\text{Number of pulses}|T_h]] = E[\\lambda_s T_h]$$\nBy linearity of expectation, this becomes:\n$$E_i(h) = \\lambda_s E[T_h] = \\frac{h \\lambda_s}{\\kappa}$$\n\n**3. Total Expected Indel Errors**\n\nThe total expected number of indel errors in the $L=1000$-base region is the sum of the expected errors from all homopolymer runs in that region. The run-length spectrum is given by the counts $\\{N(h)\\}$.\nThe total expected number of indels, $E_{indel}$, is the sum of total expected deletions, $E_{d,total}$, and total expected insertions, $E_{i,total}$.\n$$E_{indel} = E_{d,total} + E_{i,total}$$\n$$E_{d,total} = \\sum_{h \\ge 1} N(h) E_d(h) = \\sum_{h \\ge 1} N(h) (h-1) (1 - \\exp(-\\kappa\\Delta))$$\n$$E_{i,total} = \\sum_{h \\ge 1} N(h) E_i(h) = \\sum_{h \\ge 1} N(h) \\frac{h \\lambda_s}{\\kappa}$$\nWe can factor out the constant terms:\n$$E_{d,total} = (1 - \\exp(-\\kappa\\Delta)) \\sum_{h \\ge 1} (h-1)N(h)$$\n$$E_{i,total} = \\frac{\\lambda_s}{\\kappa} \\sum_{h \\ge 1} h N(h)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values.\nParameters: $\\kappa = 8\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $\\Delta = 0.015\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $\\lambda_{s} = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nCounts: $N(1)=350$, $N(2)=230$, $N(3)=50$, $N(4)=10$.\n\nFirst, calculate the summations:\n$$\\sum_{h \\ge 1} (h-1)N(h) = (1-1)N(1) + (2-1)N(2) + (3-1)N(3) + (4-1)N(4)$$\n$$= 0 \\cdot 350 + 1 \\cdot 230 + 2 \\cdot 50 + 3 \\cdot 10 = 0 + 230 + 100 + 30 = 360$$\nThe second sum is given by the total length of the region:\n$$\\sum_{h \\ge 1} h N(h) = 1000$$\n\nNow, calculate the constant coefficients:\n$$1 - \\exp(-\\kappa\\Delta) = 1 - \\exp(-8 \\times 0.015) = 1 - \\exp(-0.12)$$\n$$\\frac{\\lambda_s}{\\kappa} = \\frac{0.12}{8} = 0.015$$\n\nSubstitute these into the expressions for total expected errors:\n$$E_{d,total} = (1 - \\exp(-0.12)) \\times 360$$\n$$E_{i,total} = 0.015 \\times 1000 = 15$$\n\nThe total expected number of indel errors is:\n$$E_{indel} = 360(1 - \\exp(-0.12)) + 15$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$E_{indel} \\approx 360 \\times (1 - 0.8869204) + 15$$\n$$E_{indel} \\approx 360 \\times 0.1130796 + 15$$\n$$E_{indel} \\approx 40.708656 + 15 = 55.708656$$\n\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$E_{indel} \\approx 55.71$$\nThis result is the expected number of indel errors in a $1000$-base (1 kb) region, so it is the expected indel error count per kilobase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{55.71}$$", "id": "5163281"}]}
