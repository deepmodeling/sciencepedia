## Introduction
The adaptive immune system's remarkable ability to recognize and eliminate specific threats, from virus-infected cells to malignant tumors, depends on a sophisticated surveillance system. At the heart of this system is the process of [antigen processing and presentation](@entry_id:178409), where cellular proteins are broken down and their fragments are displayed on the cell surface by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules. This allows T cells to 'see' inside other cells and assess their health. A central challenge for the immune system is to differentiate between intracellular threats, which require cytotoxic responses, and extracellular dangers, which need a different mode of attack. This article addresses how the immune system solves this problem through two distinct, highly regulated pathways.

First, in "Principles and Mechanisms," we will dissect the molecular machinery of the MHC class I and class II pathways, from protein degradation to peptide loading. Next, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will explore the profound consequences of this system, examining how genetic defects cause immunodeficiencies, how viruses subvert it, and how we can harness it for groundbreaking cancer immunotherapies. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" provides an opportunity to apply these core principles through quantitative and experimental design challenges, cementing your understanding of this cornerstone of immunology.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The [adaptive immune system](@entry_id:191714)'s capacity to recognize and eliminate pathogens and malignant cells hinges on the ability of T lymphocytes to survey the protein content of other cells. This surveillance is not direct; rather, T cells recognize short peptide fragments derived from foreign or aberrant proteins. These peptides are captured and displayed on the cell surface by specialized molecules known as **Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)** proteins. The process by which proteins are degraded, and their constituent peptides are loaded onto MHC molecules for cell-surface display, is termed **[antigen processing and presentation](@entry_id:178409)**.

The immune system has evolved two distinct, though occasionally intersecting, pathways of antigen presentation, each tailored to the origin of the antigen. This segregation is fundamental to directing the appropriate type of immune response. The **MHC class I pathway** primarily displays peptides from **endogenous** antigens—proteins synthesized within the cell's cytosol, such as viral proteins or mutated self-proteins. In contrast, the **MHC class II pathway** is specialized for presenting peptides from **exogenous** antigens—proteins acquired from the extracellular environment, such as bacteria or their toxins. This chapter will dissect the principles and molecular machinery governing these two canonical pathways, as well as specialized adaptations like [cross-presentation](@entry_id:152512).

### The MHC Class I Pathway: Surveillance of the Cytosol

The MHC class I pathway serves as a cellular alarm system, reporting on the health and integrity of the cell's interior. By displaying peptides from virtually all proteins being synthesized, it allows cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to identify and eliminate cells harboring intracellular pathogens or those that have undergone malignant transformation. The journey of an endogenous antigen from a full-length protein to a peptide displayed on an MHC class I molecule is a multi-step process involving distinct subcellular compartments and specialized molecular machinery [@problem_id:4622284].

#### Protein Degradation: The Proteasome and Immunoproteasome

The primary source of peptides for the MHC class I pathway is the degradation of cytosolic proteins. The principal engine of this proteolysis is the **proteasome**, a large, multi-catalytic protease complex. Proteins are typically marked for degradation by the covalent attachment of a polyubiquitin chain. The 26S proteasome recognizes these ubiquitinated proteins, unfolds them, and threads them into its 20S core particle, where they are cleaved into short peptides.

While the **constitutive proteasome** is present in all cells, its proteolytic activity can be modulated to enhance antigen presentation. In response to inflammatory cytokines like [interferon-gamma](@entry_id:203536) (IFN-$\gamma$), cells can express alternative catalytic subunits, replacing the standard $\beta1$, $\beta2$, and $\beta5$ subunits with their inducible counterparts: $\beta1\mathrm{i}$ (**LMP2**/**PSMB9**), $\beta2\mathrm{i}$ (**MECL-1**/**PSMB10**), and $\beta5\mathrm{i}$ (**LMP7**/**PSMB8**), respectively. This forms the **[immunoproteasome](@entry_id:181772)**. The [catalytic mechanism](@entry_id:169680), which involves an N-terminal threonine residue acting as the nucleophile, remains the same. However, the altered substrate-binding pockets of the immuno-subunits shift the cleavage preferences. Specifically, the [immunoproteasome](@entry_id:181772) enhances cleavage after hydrophobic and basic residues and reduces cleavage after acidic residues. This is significant because many MHC class I molecules have binding pockets that preferentially anchor peptides with hydrophobic or basic C-terminal residues [@problem_id:5092265]. Thus, the [immunoproteasome](@entry_id:181772) enriches the pool of cytosolic peptides for species that are more likely to become stable MHC class I epitopes.

#### Peptide Transport: The TAP Transporter

The peptides generated by the proteasome are in the cytosol, but MHC class I molecules are assembled in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These two compartments are topologically distinct and separated by the ER membrane. To bridge this gap, the cell employs a dedicated peptide pump: the **Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP)**.

TAP is a heterodimer composed of TAP1 and TAP2 subunits, both of which are members of the **Adenosine Triphosphate-Binding Cassette (ABC)** transporter superfamily. It resides in the ER membrane and functions as an ATP-dependent importer, actively moving peptides from the cytosol into the ER lumen. Each subunit contains a [transmembrane domain](@entry_id:162637) (TMD), which contributes to the formation of the peptide translocation pore, and a cytosolic nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) that binds and hydrolyzes ATP to power the transport cycle.

TAP is not a passive conduit; it exhibits [substrate specificity](@entry_id:136373) that further shapes the peptide repertoire. It preferentially transports peptides that are approximately $8$ to $16$ amino acids in length. Crucially, its binding preference aligns with the output of the [immunoproteasome](@entry_id:181772), showing a bias for peptides with hydrophobic or basic residues at the C-terminus. This functional coupling between the [immunoproteasome](@entry_id:181772) and TAP ensures an efficient supply of suitable peptide precursors to the ER lumen. TAP is mechanistically distinct from other ABC transporters; for instance, unlike drug exporters such as P-glycoprotein, it is an importer into an organelle, and unlike channel-like proteins such as CFTR, it is a bona fide stoichiometric transporter [@problem_id:5092272].

#### Assembly and Peptide Loading in the Endoplasmic Reticulum

Within the ER lumen, nascent MHC class I molecules are assembled and await peptide cargo. A complete MHC class I molecule is a heterodimer consisting of a polymorphic, membrane-anchored **heavy chain** and a smaller, non-covalently associated soluble protein, **$\beta_2$**-microglobulin ($\beta_2$m). The heavy chain's extracellular portion is composed of three domains: $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, and $\alpha_3$. The $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ domains fold together to form the peptide-binding platform. This platform features a floor composed of an eight-stranded antiparallel $\beta$-sheet and is flanked by two long $\alpha$-helical walls. A defining feature of the MHC class I groove is that it is **closed at both ends**, with conserved residues forming pockets that securely bind the N- and C-termini of the peptide. This structural constraint limits the length of bound peptides to a narrow range, typically $8$ to $10$ amino acids [@problem_id:5092273]. The membrane-proximal $\alpha_3$ domain and $\beta_2$m both adopt an immunoglobulin-like fold and are crucial for the overall stability and conformation of the complex [@problem_id:5092227].

The efficient loading of a high-affinity peptide onto an MHC class I molecule is a highly chaperoned process orchestrated by the **peptide-loading complex (PLC)**. This large, multi-[protein assembly](@entry_id:173563) ensures quality control, preventing unstable, empty, or sub-optimally loaded MHC molecules from reaching the cell surface. Key components of the PLC include:
- **Calreticulin**: A lectin chaperone that binds to N-linked glycans on the nascent MHC class I heavy chain, retaining it in the ER to ensure proper folding.
- **ERp57**: A thiol oxidoreductase that associates with [calreticulin](@entry_id:203302) and catalyzes the formation and isomerization of disulfide bonds within the heavy chain's $\alpha_2$ and $\alpha_3$ domains.
- **TAP**: The peptide transporter, which serves as the central hub of the PLC, delivering the peptide cargo.
- **Tapasin**: A crucial bridging molecule that links the MHC class I heterodimer to TAP. Tapasin's function extends beyond simple tethering; it acts as a **peptide editor**. It stabilizes the MHC class I molecule in a peptide-receptive conformation and is thought to proofread the loaded peptide. It promotes the dissociation of low-affinity peptides, keeping the binding groove open for sampling until a peptide that confers high [thermal stability](@entry_id:157474) to the complex is bound. The absence of [tapasin](@entry_id:192386) leads to the surface expression of a higher proportion of unstable, sub-optimally loaded MHC class I molecules [@problem_id:5092257].

Once a stable peptide–MHC class I (pMHC-I) complex is formed, it is released from the PLC and traffics through the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane for presentation to T cells [@problem_id:4622284].

#### T-Cell Recognition of the pMHC-I Complex

On the cell surface, the pMHC-I complex is scanned by the T-[cell receptors](@entry_id:147810) (TCRs) of $CD8^+$ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The TCR engages a composite surface created by both the peptide nestled in the groove and residues on the flanking $\alpha$-helices of the $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ domains. Recognition is stabilized by the interaction of the T cell's **CD8** co-receptor, which binds to a conserved, largely peptide-independent site on the $\alpha_3$ domain of the MHC class I heavy chain [@problem_id:5092227]. This dual recognition ensures that T-cell activation is both specific to the antigen and restricted to the appropriate MHC class.

### The MHC Class II Pathway: Sampling the Extracellular Environment

The MHC class II pathway is the domain of [professional antigen-presenting cells](@entry_id:201215) (APCs), such as [dendritic cells](@entry_id:172287), macrophages, and B cells. Its function is to capture antigens from the extracellular space, process them, and present the resulting peptides to $CD4^+$ helper T cells. This initiates an [adaptive immune response](@entry_id:193449) tailored to extracellular pathogens and is essential for coordinating the activities of other immune cells, like B cells and macrophages.

#### Antigen Uptake: Gateways to the Endosomal System

Unlike the class I pathway, which samples the cytosol, the class II pathway begins with the internalization of extracellular material into the endocytic system. APCs employ several distinct mechanisms for antigen capture:
- **Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis**: This is a highly efficient process for concentrating specific soluble antigens. Receptors, such as the B-cell receptor or Fc receptors, bind their ligands, triggering the formation of [clathrin-coated vesicles](@entry_id:155964) that internalize the antigen.
- **Phagocytosis**: This mechanism is used for the engulfment of large particulate matter ($>0.5\,\mu\mathrm{m}$), such as whole bacteria or apoptotic cells. It is an actin-driven process mediated by receptors that recognize pathogen-associated patterns or opsonins.
- **Macropinocytosis**: This is a non-selective, bulk uptake of extracellular fluid and solutes. It is induced by membrane "ruffling" and forms large vesicles called macropinosomes, providing a broad sampling of the soluble proteins in the immediate environment [@problem_id:5092238].

Regardless of the entry route, the internalized antigen is enclosed within a membrane-bound vesicle that embarks on a maturation journey through the endo-lysosomal pathway, characterized by progressive acidification and fusion with lysosomes.

#### The MHC Class II Molecule and its Chaperone, the Invariant Chain

The MHC class II molecule is a heterodimer composed of two polymorphic, non-covalently linked transmembrane chains, an **$\alpha$ chain** and a **$\beta$ chain**. Similar to class I, the membrane-distal domains ($\alpha_1$ and $\beta_1$) form the peptide-binding platform. However, there is a profound structural difference: the peptide-binding groove of MHC class II is **open at both ends**. This architecture does not constrain the termini of the peptide, allowing it to extend out of the groove. Consequently, MHC class II molecules can accommodate a broader and more variable range of peptide lengths, typically from $13$ to $25$ amino acids, although a core region of about nine residues makes the primary contact with the groove [@problem_id:5092273].

This structural feature presents a challenge: how do MHC class II molecules, synthesized in the peptide-rich ER, avoid binding endogenous peptides destined for MHC class I? The solution is a dedicated chaperone protein, the **[invariant chain](@entry_id:181395) (Ii, CD74)**. The [invariant chain](@entry_id:181395) has two indispensable functions, which are mediated by distinct domains of the protein.
1.  **Groove Blocking**: A segment of the [invariant chain](@entry_id:181395)'s luminal domain, which later becomes the **Class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP)**, physically occupies the [peptide-binding groove](@entry_id:198529) of the nascent MHC class II molecule. This sterically prevents the binding of peptides and misfolded proteins present in the ER.
2.  **Endosomal Targeting**: The cytosolic tail of the [invariant chain](@entry_id:181395) contains sorting motifs (e.g., dileucine-based motifs) that are recognized by adaptor protein complexes (AP-1/AP-2). This interaction ensures that the MHC-II-Ii complex is packaged into [clathrin-coated vesicles](@entry_id:155964) at the trans-Golgi network and directed away from the default [secretory pathway](@entry_id:146813), towards the endo-lysosomal compartments where exogenous [antigen processing](@entry_id:196979) occurs [@problem_id:5092239].

#### Peptide Generation and Loading in the MHC Class II Compartment (MIIC)

The MHC-II-Ii complexes are delivered to a specialized late endosomal/lysosomal compartment, often termed the **MHC class II compartment (MIIC)**. Here, the acidic environment (pH $\sim4.5-5.0$) and the presence of active proteases, such as cathepsins, create the ideal conditions for the final steps of [antigen presentation](@entry_id:138578) [@problem_id:4622284].

Within the MIIC, the [invariant chain](@entry_id:181395) is sequentially degraded by proteases, eventually leaving only the CLIP fragment lodged in the peptide-binding groove. CLIP itself binds with moderate affinity, acting as a placeholder. The crucial final step is the exchange of CLIP for a high-affinity antigenic peptide, a process catalyzed by a non-classical MHC molecule, **HLA-DM** (or H2-DM in mice).

HLA-DM is not a peptide-presenting molecule itself but rather a **peptide editor** or **catalyst**. It binds to the MHC class II molecule, induces a conformational change, and facilitates the dissociation of CLIP and other low-affinity peptides. This opens the groove for sampling by the pool of peptides generated from the degradation of [exogenous antigens](@entry_id:204790). HLA-DM's catalytic action is not uniform; it is a kinetic proofreader. It has a much stronger destabilizing effect on low-stability complexes (like MHC-II-CLIP) than on high-stability complexes. For instance, in an experimental setting, the presence of HLA-DM might increase the dissociation rate ($k_{\text{off}}$) of CLIP by 10-fold, while only increasing the $k_{\text{off}}$ of a high-affinity antigenic peptide by 1.5-fold. This differential catalysis ensures that once a high-affinity peptide is bound, it is kinetically "locked in," while the groove is continually cleared of low-affinity binders. This editing mechanism selects for the most stable peptide-MHC complexes, which are then trafficked to the cell surface for presentation to $CD4^+$ helper T cells [@problem_id:4622291].

### A Special Case: Cross-Presentation

While the segregation of endogenous and exogenous pathways is a central tenet of immunology, a critical exception exists: **[cross-presentation](@entry_id:152512)**. This process allows professional APCs, particularly certain [dendritic cell](@entry_id:191381) subsets, to present peptides from [exogenous antigens](@entry_id:204790) on MHC class I molecules. This is vital for generating cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against viruses that do not infect APCs or against tumor cells that are phagocytosed by APCs. There are two main proposed mechanisms for cross-presentation.

1.  **The Cytosolic Pathway**: In this route, exogenous protein antigens are internalized into a [phagosome](@entry_id:192839) but are then retro-translocated across the phagosomal membrane into the cytosol. This "escape" is thought to be mediated by machinery co-opted from the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) system, such as the **Sec61 translocon** and the ATPase **p97/VCP**. Once in the cytosol, the antigen follows the canonical MHC class I pathway: it is ubiquitinated, degraded by the [proteasome](@entry_id:172113), and the resulting peptides are transported by TAP (which may be recruited to the phagosome membrane) into the lumen of the ER or the [phagosome](@entry_id:192839) for loading onto MHC class I. This pathway is therefore sensitive to inhibitors of the [proteasome](@entry_id:172113) and TAP. The efficiency of this route is also modulated by factors like the **NOX2** oxidase, which delays [phagosome acidification](@entry_id:185656), thereby limiting proteolytic destruction of the antigen and preserving it for translocation [@problem_id:5092213].

2.  **The Vacuolar Pathway**: In this alternative route, the antigen remains within the phagosome/endosome. It is degraded by endosomal proteases like cathepsins, and the resulting peptides are loaded directly onto MHC class I molecules that have been trafficked to this compartment. This pathway bypasses the need for cytosolic escape, proteasomal degradation, and TAP transport. Final peptide trimming to fit the MHC class I groove is performed by endosomal aminopeptidases, such as **Insulin-Regulated Aminopeptidase (IRAP)**, rather than the ER-resident ERAP1/2 peptidases used in the canonical pathway [@problem_id:5092213].

These parallel pathways of antigen presentation, with their intricate machinery for sorting, degradation, editing, and quality control, ensure that the T-cell repertoire can effectively survey both the intracellular and extracellular environments, mounting tailored responses to an immense diversity of threats.
