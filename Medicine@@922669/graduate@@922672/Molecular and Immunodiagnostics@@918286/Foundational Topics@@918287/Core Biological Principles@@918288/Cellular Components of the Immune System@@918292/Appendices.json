It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. I will proceed to solve it.\n\nThe solution is derived from first principles as follows.\n\nLet $A$ represent the monovalent antibody fragment (Fab) and $E$ represent a single epitope on the viral surface. The reversible binding reaction is:\n$$\nA + E \\rightleftharpoons AE\n$$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined by the law of mass action at equilibrium:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{[A][E]}{[AE]}\n$$\nwhere $[A]$, $[E]$, and $[AE]$ are the molar concentrations of the free antibody, free epitope, and the antibody-epitope complex, respectively.\n\nThe problem states that the antibody is in vast excess, so the concentration of free antibody, $[A]$, can be approximated as the total antibody concentration. Let $\\theta$ be the fraction of epitopes that are occupied by an antibody. This is also the probability that any single epitope is occupied.\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[AE]}{[E]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[AE]}{[E] + [AE]}\n$$\nFrom the definition of $K_D$, we can express $[AE]$ as $[AE] = \\frac{[A][E]}{K_D}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{\\frac{[A][E]}{K_D}}{[E] + \\frac{[A][E]}{K_D}} = \\frac{\\frac{[A]}{K_D}}{1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_D}} = \\frac{[A]}{K_D + [A]}\n$$\nThis expression gives the fractional occupancy of epitopes as a function of antibody concentration $[A]$ and the dissociation constant $K_D$.\n\nA virion is defined as neutralized if at least one of its $m$ epitopes is occupied. It is computationally simpler to first calculate the probability that a virion is *not* neutralized. A virion is not neutralized if and only if all $m$ of its epitopes are unoccupied.\n\nThe probability that a single epitope is unoccupied is $1 - \\theta$. Since the epitopes are stated to bind independently, the probability that all $m$ epitopes are simultaneously unoccupied is $(1 - \\theta)^m$.\n\nThe fraction of neutralized virions, $N$, is therefore $1$ minus the fraction of unneutralized virions:\n$$\nN = 1 - (1 - \\theta)^m\n$$\nWe require a specific neutralized fraction, $N^{\\ast} = 0.95$. Let $\\theta^{\\ast}$ be the fractional occupancy required to achieve this neutralization level.\n$$\nN^{\\ast} = 1 - (1 - \\theta^{\\ast})^m\n$$\nSolving for $\\theta^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n1 - N^{\\ast} = (1 - \\theta^{\\ast})^m\n$$\n$$\n(1 - N^{\\ast})^{1/m} = 1 - \\theta^{\\ast}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta^{\\ast} = 1 - (1 - N^{\\ast})^{1/m}\n$$\nNow, we must find the antibody concentration, $[A]^{\\ast}$, that produces this required occupancy $\\theta^{\\ast}$. We rearrange the occupancy equation to solve for $[A]$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[A]}{K_D + [A]} \\implies \\theta(K_D + [A]) = [A] \\implies \\theta K_D = [A](1 - \\theta) \\implies [A] = K_D \\frac{\\theta}{1 - \\theta}\n$$\nSo, the required antibody concentration $[A]^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$\n[A]^{\\ast} = K_D \\frac{\\theta^{\\ast}}{1 - \\theta^{\\ast}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\theta^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n[A]^{\\ast} = K_D \\frac{1 - (1 - N^{\\ast})^{1/m}}{1 - (1 - (1 - N^{\\ast})^{1/m})} = K_D \\frac{1 - (1 - N^{\\ast})^{1/m}}{(1 - N^{\\ast})^{1/m}} = K_D \\left( \\frac{1}{(1 - N^{\\ast})^{1/m}} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the antibody concentration required to achieve a neutralized fraction $N^{\\ast}$ on a virion with $m$ independent sites, characterized by a monovalent dissociation constant $K_D$.\n\nWe can now define the concentrations required before and after affinity maturation:\n$$\n[A]^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{pre}} = K_{D,\\mathrm{pre}} \\left( (1 - N^{\\ast})^{-1/m} - 1 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n[A]^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{post}} = K_{D,\\mathrm{post}} \\left( (1 - N^{\\ast})^{-1/m} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the fold-increase in neutralization potency, $\\Phi$, defined as the ratio of these concentrations:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\frac{[A]^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{pre}}}{[A]^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{post}}} = \\frac{K_{D,\\mathrm{pre}} \\left( (1 - N^{\\ast})^{-1/m} - 1 \\right)}{K_{D,\\mathrm{post}} \\left( (1 - N^{\\ast})^{-1/m} - 1 \\right)}\n$$\nThe term $\\left( (1 - N^{\\ast})^{-1/m} - 1 \\right)$ is a constant factor that depends on the viral properties ($m$) and the desired efficacy ($N^{\\ast}$) but not on the antibody's affinity. This term cancels out, leading to a remarkably simple result:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\frac{K_{D,\\mathrm{pre}}}{K_{D,\\mathrm{post}}}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that, under the model of independent, non-cooperative binding, the fold-increase in neutralization potency (defined as the reduction in antibody concentration needed for a fixed level of neutralization) is identical to the fold-increase in binding affinity. The binding affinity, $K_A$, is the inverse of the dissociation constant, $K_D$. Thus, the fold-increase in affinity from the pre-maturation to the post-maturation state is $K_{A,\\mathrm{post}}/K_{A,\\mathrm{pre}} = (1/K_{D,\\mathrm{post}})/(1/K_{D,\\mathrm{pre}}) = K_{D,\\mathrm{pre}}/K_{D,\\mathrm{post}}$, which is exactly $\\Phi$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $\\Phi$ using the given data:\n$K_{D,\\mathrm{pre}} = 23.7\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_{D,\\mathrm{post}} = 0.79\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$$\n\\Phi = \\frac{23.7}{0.79} = 30\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Phi = 30.00\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{30.00}\n$$", "id": "5097689"}, {"introduction": "A critical function of the adaptive immune system is the elimination of infected or malignant cells by Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs).
