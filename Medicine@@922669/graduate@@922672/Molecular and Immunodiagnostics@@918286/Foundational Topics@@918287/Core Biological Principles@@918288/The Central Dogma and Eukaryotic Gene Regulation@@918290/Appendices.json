The terms are well-defined ($K_d$, $\\omega$), and the assumptions (constant $[TF]$, equilibrium) are standard for simplifying such models. The problem is self-contained, objective, and well-posed, asking for a specific quantity based on the provided parameters. There are no contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation for a Single Binding Site**\nFor a single binding site, there are two possible states: unbound ($S$) and bound ($TF{:}S$). The probability of occupancy, $P_{\\text{occ,1}}$, is the fraction of total sites in the bound state:\n$$P_{\\text{occ,1}} = \\frac{[TF{:}S]}{[S] + [TF{:}S]}$$\nFrom the definition of the dissociation constant, $K_d = \\frac{[TF][S]}{[TF{:}S]}$, we can express the concentration of free sites $[S]$ in terms of the bound sites $[TF{:}S]$:\n$$[S] = K_d \\frac{[TF{:}S]}{[TF]}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[S]$ into the equation for $P_{\\text{occ,1}}$:\n$$P_{\\text{occ,1}} = \\frac{[TF{:}S]}{K_d \\frac{[TF{:}S]}{[TF]} + [TF{:}S]}$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $[TF{:}S]$ (which must be non-zero for the question to be meaningful):\n$$P_{\\text{occ,1}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[TF]} + 1}$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the occupancy probability for a single site, a result formally known as the Langmuir isotherm:\n$$P_{\\text{occ,1}} = \\frac{[TF]}{K_d + [TF]}$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\n**Derivation for Two Cooperative Binding Sites**\nFor the system with two identical sites, we use the statistical mechanics framework. The probability of the system being in a specific state is the ratio of that state's statistical weight to the sum of all possible statistical weights (the partition function, $Z$).\n\nLet the two sites be $S_1$ and $S_2$. There are four possible microstates for the system:\n1.  Both sites unbound ($S_1, S_2$).\n2.  Site $1$ bound, site $2$ unbound ($TF{:}S_1, S_2$).\n3.

If the binding events were independent ($\\omega=1$), the weight would be the product of the individual weights, i.e., $(\\frac{[TF]}{K_d}) \\times (\\frac{[TF]}{K_d})$. The problem introduces the cooperativity factor $\\omega$ which multiplies this independent weight.\n-   Statistical weight $W_{11}$ for state ($TF{:}S_1, TF{:}S_2$): $W_{11} = \\omega \\left(\\frac{[TF]}{K_d}\\right)^2 = \\omega \\frac{[TF]^2}{K_d^2}$.\n\nThe partition function, $Z$, is the sum of the statistical weights of all possible states:\n$$Z = W_{00} + W_{10} + W_{01} + W_{11}$$\n$$Z = 1 + \\frac{[TF]}{K_d} + \\frac{[TF]}{K_d} + \\omega \\frac{[TF]^2}{K_d^2}$$\n$$Z = 1 + 2 \\frac{[TF]}{K_d} + \\omega \\frac{[TF]^2}{K_d^2}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the equilibrium probability that both sites are simultaneously occupied. This corresponds to the probability of being in state ($TF{:}S_1, TF{:}S_2$), which we denote as $P_{11}$. This probability is the statistical weight of the double-occupied state, $W_{11}$, divided by the partition function, $Z$.\n$$P_{11} = \\frac{W_{11}}{Z} = \\frac{\\omega \\frac{[TF]^2}{K_d^2}}{1 + 2 \\frac{[TF]}{K_d} + \\omega \\frac{[TF]^2}{K_d^2}}$$\nTo obtain a simplified closed-form expression, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $K_d^2$:\n$$P_{11} = \\frac{K_d^2 \\left(\\omega \\frac{[TF]^2}{K_d^2}\\right)}{K_d^2 \\left(1 + 2 \\frac{[TF]}{K_d} + \\omega \\frac{[TF]^2}{K_d^2}\\right)}$$\n$$P_{11} = \\frac{\\omega [TF]^2}{K_d^2 + 2 K_d [TF] + \\omega [TF]^2}$$\nThis is the final expression for the probability of double occupancy as a function of $[TF]$, $K_d$, and $\\omega$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\omega [TF]^2}{K_d^2 + 2 K_d [TF] + \\omega [TF]^2}}$$", "id": "5167750"}, {"introduction": "While understanding binding equilibrium is crucial, the functional output of gene regulation is often a rate—the rate of transcription.
