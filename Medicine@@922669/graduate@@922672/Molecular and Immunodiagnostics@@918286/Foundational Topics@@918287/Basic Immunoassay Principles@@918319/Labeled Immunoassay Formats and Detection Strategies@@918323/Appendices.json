Consider a single-site reversible binding interaction between an antibody and antigen with dissociation constant $K_{d}$ defined by the law of mass action, $K_{d} = \\dfrac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$, where $[R]$ is free antibody, $[L]$ is free antigen, and $[RL]$ is the antibody–antigen complex.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical equilibrium (the law of mass action) and conservation of mass. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique and meaningful solution. It represents a standard, non-trivial problem in biophysical chemistry and molecular diagnostics.\n\nThe solution is developed in four parts: First, the exact expression for the fractional saturation $f$ is derived. Second, this expression is evaluated for the given numerical parameters. Third, the condition justifying a common approximation is derived. Finally, this condition is assessed for the given parameters.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Exact Expression for Fractional Saturation, $f$**\n\nWe begin with the provided definitions. The system is governed by the reversible binding equilibrium between an antibody receptor ($R$) and an antigen ligand ($L$) to form a complex ($RL$):\n$$\nR + L \\rightleftharpoons RL\n$$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action at equilibrium:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}\n$$\nwhere $[R]$, $[L]$, and $[RL]$ are the molar concentrations of free antibody, free antigen, and the antibody-antigen complex, respectively.\n\nThe total concentrations of antibody, $[R]_0$, and antigen, $[L]_0$, are conserved. Assuming no nonspecific binding, the conservation of mass equations are:\n$$\n[R]_0 = [R] + [RL] \\implies [R] = [R]_0 - [RL]\n$$\n$$\n[L]_0 = [L] + [RL] \\implies [L] = [L]_0 - [RL]\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions for the free concentrations, $[R]$ and $[L]$, into the definition of $K_d$ yields an equation solely in terms of the complex concentration $[RL]$ and the known total concentrations:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{([R]_0 - [RL])([L]_0 - [RL])}{[RL]}\n$$\nTo solve for $[RL]$, we rearrange this equation into a standard quadratic form, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $x = [RL]$.\n$$\nK_d [RL] = ([R]_0 - [RL])([L]_0 - [RL])\n$$\n$$\nK_d [RL] = [R]_0 [L]_0 - [R]_0 [RL] - [L]_0 [RL] + [RL]^2\n$$\n$$\n[RL]^2 - ([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d)[RL] + [R]_0 [L]_0 = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $[RL]$ with coefficients $a = 1$, $b = -([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d)$, and $c = [R]_0 [L]_0$. The solution is given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\n[RL] = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n$$\n$$\n[RL] = \\frac{([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d) \\pm \\sqrt{(-([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d))^2 - 4(1)([R]_0 [L]_0)}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n[RL] = \\frac{([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d) \\pm \\sqrt{([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d)^2 - 4[R]_0 [L]_0}}{2}\n$$\nWe must select the physically valid root. The concentration of the complex, $[RL]$, cannot exceed the total concentration of either reactant, i.e., $[RL] \\le [R]_0$ and $[RL] \\le [L]_0$. Let us examine the case with the 'plus' sign. The magnitude of the numerator would be $([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d) + \\sqrt{...}$. This value is strictly greater than $[R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d$. Consequently, the resulting $[RL]$ would be greater than $\\frac{[R]_0 + [L]_0}{2}$, which can violate the physical constraints. For instance, in the limiting case where $[L]_0 = 0$, we must have $[RL] = 0$. The equation becomes $[RL]^2 - ([R]_0+K_d)[RL] = 0$, with solutions $[RL]=0$ and $[RL]=[R]_0+K_d$. The latter is unphysical. The quadratic formula for $[L]_0=0$ gives $[RL] = \\frac{([R]_0+K_d) \\pm \\sqrt{([R]_0+K_d)^2}}{2} = \\frac{([R]_0+K_d) \\pm ([R]_0+K_d)}{2}$. The 'plus' root yields $[RL]=[R]_0+K_d$, while the 'minus' root correctly yields $[RL]=0$. Therefore, we must choose the minus sign.\n$$\n[RL] = \\frac{([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d) - \\sqrt{([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d)^2 - 4[R]_0 [L]_0}}{2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the fraction of occupied antibody binding sites, $f = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_0}$. Dividing the expression for $[RL]$ by $[R]_0$ gives the final exact closed-form expression for $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d) - \\sqrt{([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d)^2 - 4[R]_0 [L]_0}}{2[R]_0}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation of $f$**\n\nWe are given the following values: $K_d = 1$ nM, $[L]_0 = 5$ nM, and $[R]_0 = 1$ nM. Since all concentrations and the dissociation constant are in the same units (nM), we can substitute the numerical values directly into the expression for $f$.\n\nFirst, calculate the terms inside the expression:\n$$\n[R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d = 1 + 5 + 1 = 7\n$$\n$$\n4[R]_0 [L]_0 = 4(1)(5) = 20\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{7^2 - 20}}{2(1)} = \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{49 - 20}}{2} = \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{29}}{2}\n$$\nTo obtain the numerical value, we compute the square root of $29$ and complete the calculation:\n$$\n\\sqrt{29} \\approx 5.3851648\n$$\n$$\nf \\approx \\frac{7 - 5.3851648}{2} = \\frac{1.6148352}{2} = 0.8074176\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$\nf \\approx 0.8074\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of the Condition for the Approximation**\n\nThe simpler expression is given as $f \\approx \\frac{[L]_{0}}{K_{d} + [L]_{0}}$. This functional form is known as the Langmuir isotherm. It can be derived from the exact relationship $f = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$ (obtained by rearranging $K_d [RL] = ([R]_0 - [RL])[L]$) under the assumption that the free ligand concentration $[L]$ is not significantly depleted by binding. That is, the concentration of free antigen is approximately equal to the total concentration of antigen:\n$$\n[L] \\approx [L]_0\n$$\nFrom the mass conservation law, $[L] = [L]_0 - [RL]$. The approximation is therefore justified if and only if the concentration of the bound complex is negligible compared to the total antigen concentration:\n$$\n[RL] \\ll [L]_0\n$$\nTo establish a mathematically controlled condition, we can use the approximate expression itself to estimate the magnitude of $[RL]$. From $f \\approx \\frac{[L]_0}{K_d + [L]_0}$ and $f = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_0}$, we have:\n$$\n[RL] = f[R]_0 \\approx \\frac{[R]_0 [L]_0}{K_d + [L]_0}\n$$\nSubstituting this estimate for $[RL]$ back into our condition $[RL] \\ll [L]_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{[R]_0 [L]_0}{K_d + [L]_0} \\ll [L]_0\n$$\nAssuming $[L]_0 > 0$, we can divide both sides by $[L]_0$ to obtain the general condition for the validity of the approximation:\n$$\n\\frac{[R]_0}{K_d + [L]_0} \\ll 1\n$$\nThis condition is often referred to as the non-depleting ligand (or antigen-in-excess) regime. It requires the total antibody concentration to be much smaller than the sum of the dissociation constant and the total antigen concentration.\n\n**Part 4: Numerical Assessment of the Condition**\n\nWe now assess whether this condition is satisfied for the given parameters: $K_d = 1$ nM, $[L]_0 = 5$ nM, and $[R]_0 = 1$ nM.\nWe calculate the value of the dimensionless parameter derived in Part 3:\n$$\n\\frac{[R]_0}{K_d + [L]_0} = \\frac{1}{1 + 5} = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\nThe value of this parameter is approximately $0.167$. The notation \"$\\ll 1$\" typically implies that the quantity is smaller than $1$ by at least an order of magnitude (i.e., less than or equal to $0.1$). A value of $1/6$ is not significantly smaller than $1$. Therefore, the condition is not well satisfied.\n\nWe can see the consequence of this by comparing the approximate value of $f$ with the exact value.\nThe approximate value is:\n$$\nf_{approx} = \\frac{[L]_0}{K_d + [L]_0} = \\frac{5}{1 + 5} = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.8333\n$$\nThe exact value is $f_{exact} \\approx 0.8074$. The relative error is:\n$$\n\\text{Error} = \\frac{|f_{approx} - f_{exact}|}{f_{exact}} = \\frac{|0.8333 - 0.8074|}{0.8074} \\approx \\frac{0.0259}{0.8074} \\approx 0.0321\n$$\nThis corresponds to an error of approximately $3.2\\%$. While this error might be acceptable for some purposes, it confirms that the approximation is not highly accurate because the condition for its validity is not strongly met.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8074}$$", "id": "5127735"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of binding equilibrium, we now apply them to a ubiquitous challenge in assay development: nonspecific binding (NSB), which generates unwanted background signal.

The process involves two sequential adsorption steps, each assumed to follow a one-site Langmuir isotherm model derived from the law of mass action and site conservation.\n\nLet $S$ represent a nonspecific adsorption site on the surface. The total areal density of these sites is given as $N_s$. The total number of sites in the well of area $A$ is $N_{total} = N_s A$.\n\n**Step 1: Blocking Step**\nIn the first step, a blocking agent, $B$, at a concentration $C_B$ is incubated in the well until equilibrium is reached. The reversible binding reaction is:\n$$ S + B \\rightleftharpoons SB $$\nwhere $SB$ is a site occupied by a blocker molecule. At equilibrium, the law of mass action gives the dissociation constant $K_{d,B}$:\n$$ K_{d,B} = \\frac{[S_{free}][B]}{[SB]} $$\nHere, $[S_{free}]$ is the areal density of unoccupied sites, $[SB]$ is the areal density of occupied sites, and $[B]$ is the molar concentration of the blocker in solution, given as $C_B$.\n\nThe conservation of sites requires that the total site density $N_s$ equals the sum of free and occupied site densities:\n$$ N_s = [S_{free}] + [SB] $$\nFrom the mass action law, we have $[SB] = \\frac{[S_{free}]C_B}{K_{d,B}}$.

This wash step leaves the surface with a fixed density of available sites, $[S_{free}]$, for the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Detection Reagent Binding**\nSubsequently, the labeled detection reagent, $D$, is added at a concentration $C_D$ and allowed to equilibrate. The detection reagent binds to the sites that were not occupied by the blocker. Let's denote these available sites as $S_{avail}$. The total density of these available sites is $[S_{avail}]_{total} = [S_{free}]$ from the previous step. The binding reaction is:\n$$ S_{avail} + D \\rightleftharpoons S_{avail}D $$\nThe dissociation constant for this reaction is $K_{d,D}$:\n$$ K_{d,D} = \\frac{[S_{avail, free}][D]}{[S_{avail}D]} $$\nwhere $[S_{avail, free}]$ is the density of available sites that remain unoccupied by the detector, $[D]$ is the concentration $C_D$, and $[S_{avail}D]$ is the density of available sites that become occupied by the detector. This is the quantity we need to find, as it corresponds to the density of nonspecifically bound detection reagent, which we denote as $N_{D,surf}$. So, $[S_{avail}D] = N_{D,surf}$.\n\nSite conservation for this second step is:\n$$ [S_{avail}]_{total} = [S_{avail, free}] + N_{D,surf} $$\nSubstituting $[S_{avail, free}] = [S_{avail}]_{total} - N_{D,surf}$ into the mass action equation:\n$$ K_{d,D} = \\frac{([S_{avail}]_{total} - N_{D,surf})C_D}{N_{D,surf}} $$\nRearranging to solve for $N_{D,surf}$:\n$$ K_{d,D} N_{D,surf} = ([S_{avail}]_{total})C_D - N_{D,surf}C_D $$\n$$ N_{D,surf}(K_{d,D} + C_D) = [S_{avail}]_{total}C_D $$\n$$ N_{D,surf} = [S_{avail}]_{total} \\left( \\frac{C_D}{K_{d,D} + C_D} \\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $[S_{avail}]_{total} = [S_{free}]$ from Step 1:\n$$ N_{D,surf} = \\left( N_s \\frac{K_{d,B}}{K_{d,B} + C_B} \\right) \\left( \\frac{C_D}{K_{d,D} + C_D} \\right) $$\n\n**Step 3: Background Signal Calculation**\nThe total number of bound detection molecules, $N_{bound,D}$, is the areal density $N_{D,surf}$ multiplied by the well area $A$:\n$$ N_{bound,D} = N_{D,surf} \\times A = N_s A \\left( \\frac{K_{d,B}}{K_{d,B} + C_B} \\right) \\left( \\frac{C_D}{K_{d,D} + C_D} \\right) $$\nThe background signal, $S_{bg}$, is proportional to this number, with a proportionality constant $\\gamma$:\n$$ S_{bg} = \\gamma N_{bound,D} $$\nThus, the derived expression for the background signal is:\n$$ S_{bg} = \\gamma N_s A \\left( \\frac{K_{d,B}}{K_{d,B} + C_B} \\right) \\left( \\frac{C_D}{K_{d,D} + C_D} \\right) $$\n\n**Numerical Computation**\nWe are given the following values:\n- $A = 0.32\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$\n- $N_s = 5.0 \\times 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{sites}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n- $C_B = 50\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n- $K_{d,B} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n- $C_D = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n- $K_{d,D} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n- $\\gamma = 1.2 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{RFU}/\\mathrm{molecule}$\n\nFirst, we must ensure consistent units.

The equilibrium is $A + D \\rightleftharpoons AD$, governed by the association constant $K_D = k_{\\mathrm{on},D}/k_{\\mathrm{off},D}$.\n    $$ [AD] = K_D [A] [D] $$\n    The total concentration of the detection antibody, $[D]_T$, is conserved:\n    $$ [D]_T = [D] + [AD] = [D] + K_D [A] [D] = [D](1 + K_D [A]) $$\n    Solving for the free detection antibody concentration $[D]$ gives:\n    $$ [D] = \\frac{[D]_T}{1 + K_D [A]} $$\n    This expression shows that as the analyte concentration $[A]$ increases, the free detection antibody concentration $[D]$ decreases due to sequestration in the bulk solution. This is the origin of the high-dose hook effect.\n\n3.  **Sandwich Formation on the Surface**: The captured analyte, represented by the density $N_{A,bound}$, can then bind a free detection antibody from the solution. This is another independent Langmuir-type binding process. The fraction of captured analyte sites that are bound by a detection antibody, $f_D$, is given by:\n    $$ f_D = \\frac{K_D [D]}{1 + K_D [D]} $$\n    Substituting the expression for $[D]$:\n    $$ f_D = \\frac{K_D \\frac{[D]_T}{1 + K_D [A]}}{1 + K_D \\frac{[D]_T}{1 + K_D [A]}} = \\frac{K_D [D]_T}{1 + K_D [A] + K_D [D]_T} $$\n\n4.  **Signal Expression**: The density of the signal-generating complex, $N_{CAD}$, is the total density of captured analyte multiplied by the fraction of those that are also bound by a detection antibody.\n    $$ N_{CAD} = N_{A,bound} \\times f_D = \\left( N_{C}^{T} \\frac{K_A [A]}{1 + K_A [A]} \\right) \\left( \\frac{K_D [D]_T}{1 + K_D [A] + K_D [D]_T} \\right) $$\n    The signal $S$ is proportional to $N_{CAD}$. Since $N_{C}^{T}$ and $K_D [D]_T$ are constants, the dependence of the signal on $[A]$ is:\n    $$ S([A]) \\propto \\frac{K_A [A]}{(1 + K_A [A])(1 + K_D [D]_T + K_D [A])} $$\n\n5.  **Finding the Peak Signal**: To find the analyte concentration $[A]_p$ that gives the maximum signal, we differentiate the expression for $S([A])$ with respect to $[A]$ and set the derivative to zero. Let $f([A]) = \\frac{[A]}{(1 + K_A [A])(C + K_D [A])}$, where $C = 1 + K_D [D]_T$ is a constant. We need to solve $\\frac{df}{d[A]} = 0$.\n    $$ \\frac{d}{d[A]} \\left(\\frac{[A]}{(1 + K_A [A])(C + K_D [A])}\\right) = 0 $$\n    Using the quotient rule, the numerator of the derivative is:\n    $$ (1 + K_A [A])(C + K_D [A]) - [A] \\frac{d}{d[A]}((1 + K_A [A])(C + K_D [A])) = 0 $$\n    $$ (1 + K_A [A])(C + K_D [A]) - [A] (K_A(C + K_D [A]) + K_D(1 + K_A [A])) = 0 $$\n    $$ C + K_D [A] + C K_A [A] + K_A K_D [A]^2 - C K_A [A] - K_A K_D [A]^2 - K_D [A] - K_A K_D [A]^2 = 0 $$\n    $$ C - K_A K_D [A]^2 = 0 $$\n    Solving for $[A]$, we get the peak concentration $[A]_p$:\n    $$ [A]_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{C}{K_A K_D}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + K_D [D]_T}{K_A K_D}} $$\n\n6.  **Solving for the Target Concentration**: We need to find the concentration $[A]$ on the high-concentration side of the peak ($[A] > [A]_p$) where the signal is $90\\%$ of the peak signal, i.e., $S([A]) = 0.9 S([A]_p)$. Let $y=K_A [A]$ and use the constants $R = K_A/K_D$ and $C = 1+K_D[D]_T$. The signal expression is proportional to $g(y) = \\frac{y}{(1+y)(C+y/R)}$. The peak occurs at $y_p = K_A [A]_p = K_A \\sqrt{C/(K_A K_D)} = \\sqrt{K_A C / K_D} = \\sqrt{RC}$.\n    The equation to solve is $S([A]) = 0.9 S([A]_p)$, which translates to:\n    $$ \\frac{y}{(1+y)(C+y/R)} = 0.9 \\left( \\frac{y_p}{(1+y_p)(C+y_p/R)} \\right) $$\n    Substituting $y_p=\\sqrt{RC}$: the RHS is $0.9 \\frac{\\sqrt{RC}}{(1+\\sqrt{RC})(C+\\sqrt{C/R})} = 0.9 \\frac{\\sqrt{RC}}{\\sqrt{C}(1+\\sqrt{RC})(\\sqrt{C}+1/\\sqrt{R})} = 0.9\\frac{\\sqrt{R}}{(1+\\sqrt{RC})(\\sqrt{C}+1/\\sqrt{R})} = 0.9\\frac{R}{(1+\\sqrt{RC})^2}$.\n    $$ \\frac{y}{(1+y)(C+y/R)} = \\frac{0.9 R}{(1+\\sqrt{RC})^2} $$\n    $$ y(1+\\sqrt{RC})^2 = 0.9 R (1+y)(C+y/R) = 0.9(1+y)(RC+y) $$\n    $$ y(1+2\\sqrt{RC}+RC) = 0.9(RC+y+RCy+y^2) $$\n    $$ 0.9y^2 + (0.9 + 0.9RC - 1 - 2\\sqrt{RC} - RC)y + 0.9RC = 0 $$\n    $$ 0.9y^2 + (-0.1 - 0.1RC - 2\\sqrt{RC})y + 0.9RC = 0 $$\n    This is a quadratic equation for $y = K_A[A]$.\n\n7.  **Numerical Calculation**:\n    - $K_A = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^5}{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = 1.0 \\times 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}}$.\n    - $K_D = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^5}{5.0 \\times 10^{-3}} = 2.0 \\times 10^7 \\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}}$.\n    - $[D]_T = 2.0 \\ \\mathrm{nM} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{M}$.\n    - $K_D [D]_T = (2.0 \\times 10^7 \\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}})(2.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{M}) = 0.04$.\n    - $C = 1 + K_D [D]_T = 1.04$.\n    - $R = K_A/K_D = (1.0 \\times 10^9)/(2.0 \\times 10^7) = 50$.\n    - $RC = 50 \\times 1.04 = 52$.\n    - $\\sqrt{RC} = \\sqrt{52}$.\n\n    The quadratic equation is $ay^2+by+c=0$ with:\n    - $a = 0.9$.\n    - $b = -0.1 - 0.1(52) - 2\\sqrt{52} = -5.3 - 2\\sqrt{52}$.\n    - $c = 0.9(52) = 46.8$.\n    $b \\approx -5.3 - 2(7.21110) = -19.7222$.\n    The equation is $0.9y^2 - 19.7222 y + 46.8 = 0$.\n    The solutions are $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$:\n    $$ y = \\frac{19.7222 \\pm \\sqrt{(-19.7222)^2 - 4(0.9)(46.8)}}{2(0.9)} $$\n    $$ y = \\frac{19.7222 \\pm \\sqrt{388.965 - 168.48}}{1.8} = \\frac{19.7222 \\pm \\sqrt{220.485}}{1.8} = \\frac{19.7222 \\pm 14.8487}{1.8} $$\n    The two solutions for $y$ are:\n    $$ y_1 = \\frac{19.7222 + 14.8487}{1.8} = \\frac{34.5709}{1.8} \\approx 19.2061 $$\n    $$ y_2 = \\frac{19.7222 - 14.8487}{1.8} = \\frac{4.8735}{1.8} \\approx 2.7075 $$\n    The peak is at $y_p = \\sqrt{RC} = \\sqrt{52} \\approx 7.2111$.\n    We are looking for the concentration on the high-concentration branch, which means we need the solution where $[A] > [A]_p$, and therefore $y > y_p$. We choose $y_1 \\approx 19.2061$.\n    Finally, we find the analyte concentration $[A]$:\n    $$ [A] = \\frac{y_1}{K_A} = \\frac{19.2061}{1.0 \\times 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}}} = 19.2061 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{M} $$\n    The result is $19.2061 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$.
