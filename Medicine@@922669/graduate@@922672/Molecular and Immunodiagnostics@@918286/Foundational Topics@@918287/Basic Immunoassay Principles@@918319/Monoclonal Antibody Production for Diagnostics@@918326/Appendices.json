Let's denote the species as follows: $C$ for the immobilized capture antibody, $A$ for the analyte, and $D$ for the labeled detection antibody. The ternary complex is $CAD$. Let square brackets denote molar concentrations at equilibrium. The total concentration of capture sites is $C_t$.\n\nThe signal $S$ is proportional to the fractional occupancy of capture sites by the ternary complex, $\\theta_{CAD}$:\n$$S(d) \\propto \\theta_{CAD}(d) = \\frac{[CAD]}{C_t}$$\n\nTo find an expression for $\\theta_{CAD}$, we must model the coupled equilibria in the system. The total analyte concentration for a given dilution is $A_t = A_0/d$.\n\n**1. Solution-Phase Equilibrium**\nFirst, we analyze the equilibrium in the bulk solution between the analyte $A$ and the detection antibody $D$. They form a complex $AD$.\n$$A + D \\rightleftharpoons AD$$\nThe dissociation constant is given by $K_{d2}$:\n$$K_{d2} = \\frac{[A][D]}{[AD]}$$\nThe total concentrations of analyte and detection antibody are conserved. Assuming the amount of material bound to the surface is negligible compared to the total amounts in the solution volume (a common and valid assumption when surface area is limited and solution volume is large), we have:\n$$A_t = [A] + [AD]$$\n$$D_t = [D] + [AD]$$\nSubstituting $[A] = A_t - [AD]$ and $[D] = D_t - [AD]$ into the equilibrium expression:\n$$K_{d2} = \\frac{(A_t - [AD])(D_t - [AD])}{[AD]}$$\nThis rearranges into a quadratic equation for $[AD]$:\n$$[AD]^2 - (A_t + D_t + K_{d2})[AD] + A_t D_t = 0$$\nSolving for $[AD]$ using the quadratic formula and choosing the physically meaningful root (whereby $[AD] \\leq A_t$ and $[AD] \\leq D_t$):\n$$[AD] = \\frac{(A_t + D_t + K_{d2}) - \\sqrt{(A_t + D_t + K_{d2})^2 - 4A_t D_t}}{2}$$\nGiven $A_t$ (which depends on $d$), we can calculate $[AD]$ and subsequently the free concentrations $[A] = A_t - [AD]$ and $[D] = D_t - [AD]$.\n\n**2.

The proportionality constant cancels in the ratios, so we can set $S(d) = \\theta_{CAD}(d)$ for our calculations.\n\n**3. Numerical Calculation**\nWe are given $A_{0} = 200\\,\\text{nM}$, $D_{t} = 2.0\\,\\text{nM}$, $K_{d1} = 1.0\\,\\text{nM}$, and $K_{d2} = 5.0\\,\\text{nM}$. We need to find the minimal integer $d$ that satisfies $S(d)/S(1) \\geq 2.0$ and $S(d^2)/S(d) \\geq 1.8$.\n\nLet's compute $S(1)$ for the baseline ($d=1$, $A_t = 200\\,\\text{nM}$).\nFirst, find $[AD](1)$:\n$$[AD](1) = \\frac{(200 + 2 + 5) - \\sqrt{(200 + 2 + 5)^2 - 4(200)(2)}}{2} = \\frac{207 - \\sqrt{207^2 - 1600}}{2} \\approx 1.9508\\,\\text{nM}$$\nThen, find $[A](1)$ and $[D](1)$:\n$$[A](1) = 200 - 1.9508 = 198.0492\\,\\text{nM}$$\n$$[D](1) = 2 - 1.9508 = 0.0492\\,\\text{nM}$$\nNow, calculate $S(1)$:\n$$S(1) = \\frac{198.0492 \\times 0.0492}{(1)(5) + 198.0492(5) + 198.0492(0.0492)} \\approx \\frac{9.744}{5 + 990.246 + 9.744} \\approx 0.00970$$\n\nNow we test integer values for $d$.\n**Test $d=2$**: $A_t=100\\,\\text{nM}$.\n$$[AD](2) = \\frac{(100 + 2 + 5) - \\sqrt{107^2 - 4(100)(2)}}{2} = \\frac{107 - \\sqrt{11449 - 800}}{2} \\approx 1.9030\\,\\text{nM}$$\n$$[A](2) = 100 - 1.9030 = 98.0970\\,\\text{nM}$$\n$$[D](2) = 2 - 1.9030 = 0.0970\\,\\text{nM}$$\n$$S(2) = \\frac{98.0970 \\times 0.0970}{(1)(5) + 98.0970(5) + 98.0970(0.0970)} \\approx \\frac{9.515}{5 + 490.485 + 9.515} \\approx 0.01884$$\nRatio check for condition 1:\n$$\\frac{S(2)}{S(1)} \\approx \\frac{0.01884}{0.00970} \\approx 1.942$$\nSince $1.942 < 2.0$, $d=2$ does not satisfy the first condition.\n\n**Test $d=3$**: $A_t=200/3 \\approx 66.667\\,\\text{nM}$.\n$$[AD](3) = \\frac{(200/3 + 2 + 5) - \\sqrt{(200/3+7)^2 - 4(200/3)(2)}}{2} \\approx 1.8568\\,\\text{nM}$$\n$$[A](3) = 200/3 - 1.8568 \\approx 64.810\\,\\text{nM}$$\n$$[D](3) = 2 - 1.8568 = 0.1432\\,\\text{nM}$$\n$$S(3) = \\frac{64.810 \\times 0.1432}{(1)(5) + 64.810(5) + 64.810(0.1432)} \\approx \\frac{9.281}{5 + 324.05 + 9.281} \\approx 0.02743$$\nRatio check for condition 1:\n$$\\frac{S(3)}{S(1)} \\approx \\frac{0.02743}{0.00970} \\approx 2.828$$\nSince $2.828 \\geq 2.0$, the first condition is satisfied.
