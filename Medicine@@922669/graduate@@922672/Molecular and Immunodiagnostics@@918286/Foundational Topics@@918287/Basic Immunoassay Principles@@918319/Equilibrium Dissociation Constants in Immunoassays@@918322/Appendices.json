The reversible reaction between the antibody $A$ and the antigen $B$ to form the complex $AB$ is given as:\n$$\nA + B \\rightleftharpoons AB\n$$\nThis reaction is characterized by a forward (association) process and a reverse (dissociation) process. According to the law of mass action for elementary reactions, the rate of the forward reaction, $R_{fwd}$, is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants, and the rate of the reverse reaction, $R_{rev}$, is proportional to the concentration of the product.\n\nLet $k_{on}$ be the association rate constant (in units of M$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, for example) and $k_{off}$ be the dissociation rate constant (in units of s$^{-1}$). The rates are expressed as:\n$$\nR_{fwd} = k_{on}[A][B]\n$$\n$$\nR_{rev} = k_{off}[AB]\n$$\nAt chemical equilibrium, the net rate of reaction is zero, which means the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction:\n$$\nR_{fwd} = R_{rev}\n$$\nSubstituting the rate expressions gives the equilibrium condition:\n$$\nk_{on}[A][B] = k_{off}[AB]\n$$\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as the ratio of the dissociation rate constant to the association rate constant:\n$$\nK_d \\equiv \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}}\n$$\nBy rearranging the equilibrium condition equation, we can express this ratio in terms of the equilibrium concentrations of the species involved:\n$$\n\\frac{[A][B]}{[AB]} = \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}}\n$$\nTherefore, the expression for the equilibrium dissociation constant $K_d$ is:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{[A][B]}{[AB]}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we evaluate the numerical value of $K_d$ using the provided equilibrium concentrations. The given data are:\n- Free antibody concentration, $[A] = 10 \\text{ nM}$\n- Free antigen concentration, $[B] = 90 \\text{ nM}$\n- Complex concentration, $[AB] = 40 \\text{ nM}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $K_d$:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{(10 \\text{ nM})(90 \\text{ nM})}{40 \\text{ nM}}\n$$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{900 \\text{ (nM)}^2}{40 \\text{ nM}} = \\frac{90}{4} \\text{ nM} = 22.5 \\text{ nM}\n$$\nThe numerical value of the equilibrium dissociation constant is $22.5$ nM.\n\nFinally, we interpret this result. The dissociation constant $K_d$ is a measure of the affinity between the antibody and the antigen. A smaller $K_d$ value indicates a higher affinity (stronger binding), while a larger $K_d$ value indicates a lower affinity (weaker binding). In the context of immunoassays:\n- High affinity is typically characterized by $K_d  1 \\text{ nM}$.\n- Moderate affinity is in the range of $K_d \\approx 1-100 \\text{ nM}$.\n- Low affinity corresponds to $K_d  100 \\text{ nM}$.\n\nThe calculated value of $K_d = 22.5 \\text{ nM}$ falls within the **moderate affinity** range. This level of affinity is common and useful for many diagnostic immunoassays.\n\nThe dynamic range of an immunoassay is the concentration range of the analyte over which the assay provides a useful and graduated response. This response is related to the fraction of antibody binding sites that are occupied by the antigen. For a single noncooperative binding site, the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is described by the Langmuir binding isotherm:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[\\text{Bound Antibody}]}{[\\text{Total Antibody}]} = \\frac{[AB]}{[A] + [AB]}\n$$\nUsing the relationship $[A] = K_d \\frac{[AB]}{[B]}$, this can be rewritten as a function of the free antigen concentration $[B]$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[B]}{K_d + [B]}\n$$\nThis equation describes a sigmoidal relationship when plotted against $\\log([B])$. The most sensitive part of this curve, where the slope is steepest, occurs at the inflection point. The inflection point corresponds to the concentration of free antigen at which half of the total antibody binding sites are occupied ($\\theta = 0.5$). Setting $\\theta = 0.5$:\n$$\n0.5 = \\frac{[B]}{K_d + [B]} \\implies 0.5(K_d + [B]) = [B] \\implies 0.5 K_d = 0.5 [B] \\implies [B] = K_d\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the center of the assay's dynamic range, where it is most responsive to changes in analyte concentration, is located at an analyte concentration equal to the $K_d$ value. Therefore, for this particular assay, the dynamic range is expected to be centered around an antigen concentration of $22.5 \\text{ nM}$. This is the concentration at which the assay will have its greatest sensitivity for detecting changes in the amount of antigen $B$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{22.5}$$", "id": "5113381"}, {"introduction": "Beyond calculating $K_d$, its true power lies in its predictive capacity for assay design.

We will start by manipulating these three fundamental equations.\n\nFirst, we express the free antibody concentration, $[A]$, in terms of the total and bound concentrations from the conservation of mass equation:\n$$ [A] = [A]_T - [AL] $$\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for $[A]$ into the definition of $K_d$:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{([A]_T - [AL])[L]}{[AL]} $$\n\nTo introduce $\\theta$ into this equation, we use its definition, $\\theta = \\frac{[AL]}{[A]_T}$. We can rearrange this to express $[AL]$ in terms of $\\theta$ and $[A]_T$:\n$$ [AL] = \\theta [A]_T $$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $[AL]$ into our equation for $K_d$:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{([A]_T - \\theta[A]_T)[L]}{\\theta[A]_T} $$\n\nThe term $[A]_T$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator.

The problem provides the following values:\n-   Equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d = 1$ nM.\n-   Target fractional occupancy, $\\theta = 0.9$.\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$ [L] = (1 \\text{ nM}) \\times \\frac{0.9}{1 - 0.9} $$\n$$ [L] = (1 \\text{ nM}) \\times \\frac{0.9}{0.1} $$\n$$ [L] = (1 \\text{ nM}) \\times 9 $$\n$$ [L] = 9 \\text{ nM} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. To express $9$ with three significant figures, we write it as $9.00$.\nTherefore, the free ligand concentration required to achieve $90\\%$ occupancy is $9.00$ nM.\n\nFinally, we are asked to comment on the practicality of operating at $\\theta = 0.9$ in a clinical immunoassay context (e.g., ELISA). Operating at $90\\%$ occupancy is generally impractical for quantitative clinical immunoassays because this condition lies on the upper, saturating part of the sigmoidal dose-response curve.
