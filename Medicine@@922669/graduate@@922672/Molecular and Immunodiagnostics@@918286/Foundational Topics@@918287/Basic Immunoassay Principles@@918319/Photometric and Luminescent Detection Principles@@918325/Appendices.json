The absorbance, $A$, is defined in terms of the incident radiant power, $P_0$, and the transmitted radiant power, $P$, as:\n$$\nA = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{P_0}{P}\\right)\n$$\nThis is a base-$10$ logarithmic scale.\n\nNow, consider the linear attenuation of monochromatic light. As light traverses a thin differential layer of an absorbing medium of thickness $dx$, the decrease in radiant power, $dP$, is proportional to the incident power at that layer, $P(x)$, the molar concentration of the absorbing species, $c$, and the thickness of the layer, $dx$.

Under continuous excitation, the rate of change of $N^*$ is given by the balance between the rate of absorption ($R_{abs}$) and the total rate of deactivation.\n\nIn the absence of a quencher, the excited state deactivates via radiative decay (rate constant $k_r$) and intrinsic nonradiative decay (rate constant $k_{nr}$). The total decay rate constant is $k_0 = k_r + k_{nr}$.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the relationship between $r$ and $m$ using a time-budget argument. Let us consider a long observation period of duration $T$.\n\nThe total number of counts registered by the detector during this period is $N_m$. The measured count rate $m$ is defined as the average number of counts per unit time, so:\n$$N_m = m T$$\n\nA nonparalyzable detector is characterized by a fixed dead time $\\tau_d$ that follows each registered event. During this dead time, any further incoming photons are not detected, and they do not extend the dead interval. Therefore, for each of the $N_m$ counts registered, the detector is \"dead\" or unresponsive for a duration $\\tau_d$.\n\nThe total dead time, $T_{dead}$, during the observation period $T$ is the number of registered counts multiplied by the dead time per count:\n$$T_{dead} = N_m \\tau_d = (m T) \\tau_d$$\n\nThe detector is only capable of registering new photons during its \"live\" time, $T_{live}$. The total live time is the total observation time minus the total dead time:\n$$T_{live} = T - T_{dead} = T - m T \\tau_d = T(1 - m \\tau_d)$$\n\nThe fundamental assumption of this model is that the observed counts are simply the true incident photons that happen to arrive when the detector is live. Since the true photon arrival is a Poisson process with an average rate $r$, the number of counts one expects to register during the total live time $T_{live}$ is the product of the true rate and the live time. This expected number must be equal to the number of counts actually measured, $N_m$.\n$$N_m = r \\cdot T_{live}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $N_m$ and $T_{live}$:\n$$m T = r \\cdot T(1 - m \\tau_d)$$\nAssuming the observation time $T$ is non-zero, we can divide both sides by $T$ to obtain the relationship between the measured rate $m$ and the true rate $r$:\n$$m = r(1 - m \\tau_d)$$\n\nThis is one form of the required relationship.
