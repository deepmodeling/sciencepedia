A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe primary task is to derive the post-test probability of infection given a positive test result. This quantity is formally known as the Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$). Let us define the following events:\n- $D$: The patient truly has the disease (is infected with the virus).\n- $D^c$: The patient does not have the disease.\n- $T^+$: The test result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The test result is negative.\n\nThe givens can be expressed in terms of conditional probabilities:\n- The pretest probability of disease is $P(D) = 0.08$. Consequently, the probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92$.\n- Sensitivity ($\\text{Se}$) is the probability of a positive test given that the patient has the disease: $\\text{Se} = P(T^+|D) = 0.94$.\n- Specificity ($\\text{Sp}$) is the probability of a negative test given that the patient does not have the disease: $\\text{Sp} = P(T^-|D^c) = 0.975$.\n\nWe are asked to find the post-test probability of disease given a positive test, which is the conditional probability $P(D|T^+)$.\n\nAccording to the formal definition of conditional probability, which is the starting point as per the problem statement:\n$$ P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)} $$\nwhere $P(D \\cap T^+)$ is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive, and $P(T^+)$ is the total probability of testing positive.\n\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T^+)$, can be re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability for sensitivity, $P(T^+|D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(D)}$. Rearranging this gives:\n$$ P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+|D) P(D) = (\\text{Se}) \\cdot P(D) $$\nThis term represents the true positives.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, can be expanded using the law of total probability. A positive test result can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: a true positive (the patient has the disease and tests positive) or a false positive (the patient does not have the disease but tests positive).\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c) $$\nThe first term is the probability of a true positive. The second term is the probability of a false positive. We have $P(T^+|D) = \\text{Se}$ and $P(D)$. We need to find $P(T^+|D^c)$, which is the false positive rate. This is the complement of the specificity (the true negative rate):\n$$ P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - \\text{Sp} $$\n\nSubstituting all components back into the expression for $P(D|T^+)$ yields Bayes' theorem for diagnostic testing:\n$$ P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)} $$\nThis is the derived expression in terms of pretest probability, sensitivity, and specificity (since $P(T^+|D^c) = 1-\\text{Sp}$ and $P(D^c)=1-P(D)$). Let's denote the pretest probability $p_{pre} = P(D)$. The final expression is:\n$$ PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{(\\text{Se}) \\cdot p_{pre}}{(\\text{Se}) \\cdot p_{pre} + (1 - \\text{Sp}) \\cdot (1 - p_{pre})} $$\nThis completes the derivation part of the task.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n- $p_{pre} = 0.08$\n- $\\text{Se} = 0.94$\n- $\\text{Sp} = 0.975$\n\nFirst, we calculate the required components:\n- Probability of not having the disease: $1 - p_{pre} = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92$\n- False positive rate: $1 - \\text{Sp} = 1 - 0.975 = 0.025$\n\nNext, we calculate the probability of a true positive result in the population:\n- $(\\text{Se}) \\cdot p_{pre} = 0.94 \\times 0.08 = 0.0752$\n\nThen, we calculate the probability of a false positive result in the population:\n- $(1 - \\text{Sp}) \\cdot (1 - p_{pre}) = 0.025 \\times 0.92 = 0.023$\n\nThe total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$, is the sum of these two probabilities:\n- $P(T^+) = 0.0752 + 0.023 = 0.0982$\n\nFinally, the post-test probability $P(D|T^+)$ is the ratio of the true positive probability to the total positive probability:\n$$ P(D|T^+) = \\frac{0.0752}{0.0982} \\approx 0.765784114... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P(D|T^+) \\approx 0.7658 $$\nThis value represents the patient's probability of being infected after receiving a single positive RT-qPCR result.
