Derivation of the Overall Mislabeling Probability $P_{\\mathrm{mis}}$**\n\nThe overall mislabeling probability at release, $P_{\\mathrm{mis}}$, is the probability that a specimen is mislabeled and this mislabel is not detected. Under the rare-event approximation, we can sum the probabilities of the mutually exclusive primary failure pathways. A failure occurs if a mislabel is introduced at some step $i$ and survives all subsequent relevant checks.\n\nLet $M_{i}$ be the event that a mislabel is introduced at step $i$. Let $D_{j}$ be the event that check $j$ detects a mislabel, and $D_{j}^c$ be the event that it fails to detect it (a false negative). The probability of a false negative is $P(D_{j}^c) = f_{j} = 1 - s_{j}$.\n\n- A mislabel introduced at Step 1 (probability $p_{1}$) must evade checks $1$, $3$, and $4$. The probability of this pathway is:\n$$P(\\text{surviving } M_1) = p_{1} \\cdot P(D_1^c) \\cdot P(D_3^c) \\cdot P(D_4^c) = p_{1} f_{1} f_{3} f_{4}$$\n- A mislabel introduced at Step 2 (probability $p_{2}$) occurs after check $1$. It must evade checks $3$ and $4$. The probability of this pathway is:\n$$P(\\text{surviving } M_2) = p_{2} \\cdot P(D_3^c) \\cdot P(D_4^c) = p_{2} f_{3} f_{4}$$\n- A mislabel introduced at Step 3 (probability $p_{3}$) must evade checks $3$ and $4$. The probability of this pathway is:\n$$P(\\text{surviving } M_3) = p_{3} \\cdot P(D_3^c) \\cdot P(D_4^c) = p_{3} f_{3} f_{4}$$\n- A mislabel introduced at Step 4 (probability $p_{4}$) occurs after all checks. It is not subject to any detection. The probability of this pathway is:\n$$P(\\text{surviving } M_4) = p_{4}$$\n\nThe total probability $P_{\\mathrm{mis}}$ is the sum of these probabilities:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{mis}} = P(\\text{surviving } M_1) + P(\\text{surviving } M_2) + P(\\text{surviving } M_3) + P(\\text{surviving } M_4)$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{mis}} = p_{1} f_{1} f_{3} f_{4} + p_{2} f_{3} f_{4} + p_{3} f_{3} f_{4} + p_{4}$$\nThis expression can be simplified by factoring:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{mis}} = p_{1} f_{1} f_{3} f_{4} + (p_{2} + p_{3}) f_{3} f_{4} + p_{4}$$\n\n**2.

Expected Number of Injuries Prevented**\nWithout any change, the expected number of injuries over an exposure of $T$ person-years is $\\lambda T$. With partial adoption of SEDs, a fraction $p$ of procedures will have an associated injury rate of $\\lambda \\times RR$, while the remaining fraction $(1-p)$ will have the baseline rate $\\lambda$. The new effective rate, $\\lambda_{new}$, is a weighted average:\n$$ \\lambda_{new} = (1-p)\\lambda + p(\\lambda \\cdot RR) = \\lambda(1 - p + p \\cdot RR) $$\nThe number of injuries under the new policy over $T$ person-years is $N_{new} = \\lambda_{new}T$. The number of injuries prevented, $N_{prev}$, is the difference between the baseline number of injuries, $N_{base} = \\lambda T$, and the new number of injuries.\n$$ N_{prev} = N_{base} - N_{new} = \\lambda T - \\lambda T(1 - p + p \\cdot RR) = \\lambda T (1 - (1 - p + p \\cdot RR)) $$\n$$ N_{prev} = \\lambda T (p - p \\cdot RR) = \\lambda T p (1 - RR) $$\nThe problem asks for the number of injuries prevented over the next $T=220$ person-years, which corresponds to the total number prevented in the laboratory over one year. We can calculate the point estimate, $\\hat{N}_{prev}$, by substituting the estimated parameters:\n$$ \\hat{N}_{prev} = \\hat{\\lambda} T p (1 - \\hat{RR}) = \\left(\\frac{16}{220}\\right) (220) (0.65) (1 - 0.40) $$\n$$ \\hat{N}_{prev} = 16 \\times 0.65 \\times 0.60 = 16 \\times 0.39 = 6.24 $$\nThe expected number of injuries prevented per year is $6.24$.\n\n**3. Confidence Interval for the Number of Injuries Prevented**\nTo find the confidence interval, we must first estimate the variance of $\\hat{N}_{prev}$ by propagating the uncertainty from the estimators $\\hat{\\lambda}$ and $\\hat{RR}$. The problem specifies using a first-order Taylor expansion (delta method). It is convenient to work with $\\hat{\\theta} = \\ln(\\hat{RR})$, as its standard error is given. Let our function be $g(\\lambda, \\theta) = T p (1-\\exp(\\theta)) \\lambda$. The estimators $\\hat{\\lambda}$ and $\\hat{\\theta}$ are independent. The variance of $g(\\hat{\\lambda}, \\hat{\\theta})$ is approximated as:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{N}_{prev}) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\lambda}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda}) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}) $$\nThe partial derivatives are evaluated at the point estimates $\\lambda = \\hat{\\lambda}$ and $\\theta = \\hat{\\theta} = \\ln(\\hat{RR})$.\n\nFirst, we find the variances of the estimators:\n-   $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda})$: For a Poisson process with $k$ events in time $T$, $\\hat{\\lambda} = k/T$. The variance of the estimator is $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda}) = \\lambda/T$. We estimate this using $\\hat{\\lambda}$:\n    $$ \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\lambda}) = \\frac{\\hat{\\lambda}}{T} = \\frac{k/T}{T} = \\frac{k}{T^2} = \\frac{16}{220^2} = \\frac{16}{48400} $$\n-   $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta})$: The problem provides the standard error of $\\hat{\\theta}=\\ln(\\hat{RR})$ as $s = 0.15$. The variance is:\n    $$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}) = s^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the partial derivatives of $g(\\lambda, \\theta)$:\n-   $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\lambda} = T p (1 - \\exp(\\theta)) = T p (1 - RR)$. At the point estimates:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\lambda} \\bigg|_{\\hat{\\lambda},\\hat{\\theta}} = 220 \\times 0.65 \\times (1 - 0.40) = 143 \\times 0.60 = 85.8 $$\n-   $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\theta} = -T p \\lambda \\exp(\\theta) = -T p \\lambda RR$. At the point estimates:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial \\theta} \\bigg|_{\\hat{\\lambda},\\hat{\\theta}} = -220 \\times 0.65 \\times \\left(\\frac{16}{220}\\right) \\times 0.40 = -16 \\times 0.65 \\times 0.40 = -4.16 $$\n\nNow, we compute the variance of $\\hat{N}_{prev}$:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{N}_{prev}) \\approx (85.8)^2 \\left(\\frac{16}{220^2}\\right) + (-4.16)^2 (0.15)^2 $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{N}_{prev}) \\approx (7361.64) \\left(\\frac{16}{48400}\\right) + (17.3056)(0.0225) $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{N}_{prev}) \\approx 2.4336 + 0.389376 = 2.822976 $$\nThe standard error of $\\hat{N}_{prev}$ is:\n$$ \\text{SE}(\\hat{N}_{prev}) = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\hat{N}_{prev})} \\approx \\sqrt{2.822976} \\approx 1.6801714 $$\nAn approximate $95\\%$ confidence interval for $N_{prev}$ is constructed using the normal approximation, $\\hat{N}_{prev} \\pm z_{0.975} \\times \\text{SE}(\\hat{N}_{prev})$, where $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$.\n$$ \\text{CI}_{95\\%} = 6.24 \\pm 1.96 \\times 1.6801714 $$\n$$ \\text{CI}_{95\\%} = 6.24 \\pm 3.293136 $$\n$$ \\text{CI}_{95\\%} = [2.946864, 9.533136] $$\nThe quantity $N_{prev}$ is the number of injuries prevented over $T=220$ person-years, which is the annual figure for the laboratory. Thus, the unit is injuries/year. The lower $95\\%$ confidence bound is $2.946864$ injuries/year.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\nRounding the lower bound to four significant figures, we get $2.947$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.947}$$", "id": "5095815"}]}
