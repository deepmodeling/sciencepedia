To compare their magnitudes, we take their ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{PPV} / \\partial \\mathrm{Sp}}{\\partial \\mathrm{PPV} / \\partial \\mathrm{Se}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi(1 - \\pi)}{\\pi(1 - \\mathrm{Sp})(1 - \\pi)} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Se}}{1 - \\mathrm{Sp}} $$\nThis ratio represents how many times more sensitive $\\mathrm{PPV}$ is to a change in $\\mathrm{Sp}$ compared to an identical change in $\\mathrm{Se}$. At the baseline operating point ($\\mathrm{Se}=0.95$, $\\mathrm{Sp}=0.97$), this ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{0.95}{1 - 0.97} = \\frac{0.95}{0.03} \\approx 31.67 $$\nThis large value indicates that $\\mathrm{PPV}$ is overwhelmingly more sensitive to changes in specificity than sensitivity. The condition for the impact of specificity to be greater is $\\mathrm{Se} / (1-\\mathrm{Sp}) > 1$, which simplifies to $\\mathrm{Se} + \\mathrm{Sp} > 1$. This condition, known as Youden's criterion being positive, holds for any diagnostically useful test. Furthermore, in a low prevalence ($\\pi \\ll 1$) setting, the formula for $\\mathrm{PPV}$ can be approximated:\n$$ \\mathrm{PPV} \\approx \\frac{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi}{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp})} $$\nAs $\\pi \\to 0$, the $\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi$ term in the denominator becomes negligible compared to the false positive rate term $(1-\\mathrm{Sp})$. The $\\mathrm{PPV}$ becomes dominated by the ratio of true positives to false positives. A small change in the already small $(1-\\mathrm{Sp})$ term creates a large relative change in the denominator, hence a large change in $\\mathrm{PPV}$. The proposed changes $\\Delta \\mathrm{Se} = 0.02$ and $\\Delta \\mathrm{Sp} = 0.02$ are identical, but the much higher sensitivity to $\\mathrm{Sp}$ guarantees that the specificity-enhancing adjustment will have a larger impact on $\\mathrm{PPV}$.\n\n**4.

This modifies the counts for the negative test category, while the positive test category remains unchanged.\n\nThe effective counts for Approach $\\mathrm{A}$ are:\n- $TP_{\\mathrm{A}} = 240$\n- $FP_{\\mathrm{A}} = 90$\n- $FN_{\\mathrm{A}} = FN_{base} + (\\text{Indeterminate } D^{+}) = 120 + 60 = 180$\n- $TN_{\\mathrm{A}} = TN_{base} + (\\text{Indeterminate } D^{-}) = 960 + 30 = 990$\n\nThe total number of subjects with a positive test result is $TP_{\\mathrm{A}} + FP_{\\mathrm{A}} = 240 + 90 = 330$.\nThe total number of subjects with a negative test result is $TN_{\\mathrm{A}} + FN_{\\mathrm{A}} = 990 + 180 = 1170$.\nThe total sample size remains $N=1500$.\n\nThe predictive values for Approach $\\mathrm{A}$ are:\n$$PPV_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{TP_{\\mathrm{A}}}{TP_{\\mathrm{A}} + FP_{\\mathrm{A}}} = \\frac{240}{240 + 90} = \\frac{240}{330} = \\frac{24}{33} = \\frac{8}{11}$$\n$$NPV_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{TN_{\\mathrm{A}}}{TN_{\\mathrm{A}} + FN_{\\mathrm{A}}} = \\frac{990}{990 + 180} = \\frac{990}{1170} = \\frac{99}{117} = \\frac{11}{13}$$\n\n**Approach $\\mathrm{B}$: Exclude Indeterminate Results**\nIn this approach, all $90$ indeterminate results are removed from the analysis. The new total sample size is $N_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1500 - 90 = 1410$.\nThe counts are based only on the initial positive and negative results.\n\nThe effective counts for Approach $\\mathrm{B}$ are:\n- $TP_{\\mathrm{B}} = 240$\n- $FP_{\\mathrm{B}} = 90$\n- $FN_{\\mathrm{B}} = 120$\n- $TN_{\\mathrm{B}} = 960$\n\nThe total number of subjects with a positive test result is $TP_{\\mathrm{B}} + FP_{\\mathrm{B}} = 240 + 90 = 330$.\nThe total number of subjects with a negative test result is $TN_{\\mathrm{B}} + FN_{\\mathrm{B}} = 960 + 120 = 1080$.\nThe total sample size is $330 + 1080 = 1410$.\n\nThe predictive values for Approach $\\mathrm{B}$ are:\n$$PPV_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{TP_{\\mathrm{B}}}{TP_{\\mathrm{B}} + FP_{\\mathrm{B}}} = \\frac{240}{240 + 90} = \\frac{240}{330} = \\frac{24}{33} = \\frac{8}{11}$$\n$$NPV_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{TN_{\\mathrm{B}}}{TN_{\\mathrm{B}} + FN_{\\mathrm{B}}} = \\frac{960}{960 + 120} = \\frac{960}{1080} = \\frac{96}{108} = \\frac{8}{9}$$\n\n**Calculate the Change in Predictive Values**\nThe change is defined as $\\Delta = \\text{Approach A} - \\text{Approach B}$.\n$$\\Delta PPV = PPV_{\\mathrm{A}} - PPV_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{8}{11} - \\frac{8}{11} = 0$$\n$$\\Delta NPV = NPV_{\\mathrm{A}} - NPV_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{11}{13} - \\frac{8}{9} = \\frac{11 \\times 9}{13 \\times 9} - \\frac{8 \\times 13}{9 \\times 13} = \\frac{99 - 104}{117} = -\\frac{5}{117}$$\n\n**Interpretation of Bias**\n- **PPV**: The change in PPV is zero ($\\Delta PPV = 0$). This is because PPV is conditioned on a positive test result ($P(D^{+} \\mid T^{+})$). In Approach $\\mathrm{A}$, indeterminate results are reclassified as negative. This action does not alter the composition of the group of individuals who tested positive. The set $\\{T^{+}\\}$ contains the same $TP=240$ and $FP=90$ cases in both Approach $\\mathrm{A}$ and Approach $\\mathrm{B}$. Since the numerator ($TP$) and the denominator ($TP+FP$) of the PPV calculation are identical for both approaches, the resulting PPV is unchanged. Treating indeterminate results as negative does not introduce bias into the PPV estimate relative to excluding them.\n\n- **NPV**: The change in NPV is negative ($\\Delta NPV  0$), meaning $NPV_{\\mathrm{A}}  NPV_{\\mathrm{B}}$. This indicates that treating indeterminate results as negative introduces a pessimistic bias (an underestimation) in the NPV. NPV is conditioned on a negative test result ($P(D^{-} \\mid T^{-})$). In Approach $\\mathrm{A}$, the pool of test-negative individuals is expanded by including the $90$ indeterminate cases. We compare the proportion of non-diseased individuals in the original negative group to the proportion in the added indeterminate group.\n    - The \"purity\" of the original negative group (used in Approach $\\mathrm{B}$) is $NPV_{\\mathrm{B}} = P(D^{-} \\mid T^{-}) = \\frac{960}{1080} = \\frac{8}{9} \\approx 0.889$.\n    - The proportion of non-diseased individuals among the indeterminate group is $P(D^{-} \\mid T^{ind}) = \\frac{30}{30+60} = \\frac{30}{90} = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333$.\n    - Since the proportion of non-diseased subjects in the indeterminate group ($\\frac{1}{3}$) is substantially lower than in the original negative group ($\\frac{8}{9}$), adding the indeterminate group to the negative pool effectively \"contaminates\" it with a higher fraction of diseased individuals (false negatives). This mixing of a low-purity group with a high-purity group results in a final mixture with a lower overall purity. Consequently, $NPV_{\\mathrm{A}}$ is lower than $NPV_{\\mathrm{B}}$. The probability that a negative result truly signifies an absence of disease is reduced.\n\nFinal vector for answer:\n$(PPV_{\\mathrm{A}}, NPV_{\\mathrm{A}}, PPV_{\\mathrm{B}}, NPV_{\\mathrm{B}}, \\Delta PPV, \\Delta NPV) = \\left(\\frac{8}{11}, \\frac{11}{13}, \\frac{8}{11}, \\frac{8}{9}, 0, -\\frac{5}{117}\\right)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{8}{11}  \\frac{11}{13}  \\frac{8}{11}  \\frac{8}{9}  0  -\\frac{5}{117}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5105209"}]}
