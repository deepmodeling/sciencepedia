Expressed as decimals rounded to four significant figures, they are $0.9500$, $0.9800$, $0.7143$, and $0.9973$.\n\nRegarding the impact of prevalence on predictive values:\nThe derived formulas show that both PPV and NPV are functions of prevalence ($P$).\nThe PPV expression, $\\frac{S_e \\cdot P}{S_e \\cdot P + (1 - S_p)(1 - P)}$, has $P$ in the numerator and denominator. As prevalence $P$ increases, the numerator (true positives, $S_e \\cdot P$) increases, while one term in the denominator (false positives, $(1 - S_p)(1 - P)$) decreases. The net effect is a systematic increase in PPV. Thus, in high-prevalence settings like symptomatic inpatient populations, a positive test result is more likely to be a true positive. Conversely, in low-prevalence settings like asymptomatic community screening, PPV will be lower, meaning a larger fraction of positive results will be false positives.\n\nThe NPV expression, $\\frac{S_p \\cdot (1 - P)}{S_p \\cdot (1 - P) + (1 - S_e) P}$, also depends on $P$. As prevalence $P$ increases, the numerator (true negatives, $S_p \\cdot (1-P)$) decreases, while the second term in the denominator (false negatives, $(1 - S_e) P$) increases. The net effect is a systematic decrease in NPV. In a high-prevalence setting, a negative result carries a higher risk of being a false negative compared to the same result in a low-prevalence setting.\n\nFor regulatory compliance (e.g., under CLIA), laboratory procedures must be fully documented and transparent. Since the LIS is dynamically computing PPV and NPV, which are not fixed characteristics of the assay but depend on an external variable (prevalence), the system must document the specific prevalence value used for each calculation. To ensure traceability and defensibility during an audit, the documentation for each batch report must include: (1) the calculated PPV and NPV values, (2) the exact prevalence value ($P$) used as input for the calculation, and (3) a reference to the source and date of the prevalence data (e.g., \"local health department surveillance report for week ending M/D/YYYY\").

First Principles of Shewhart Charts and Westgard Rules\n\nA Shewhart chart is a graphical tool used for statistical process control, which plots a measured quality characteristic over time to monitor process stability. In this context, the characteristic is the internal control's cycle threshold (Ct) value. The chart is constructed around a center line representing the process mean ($\\mu$) and includes control limits set at a distance of $k$ standard deviations ($\\sigma$) from the mean.\n\nThe foundation for these limits lies in the properties of the normal distribution, which is given to approximate the distribution of Ct values. For a normally distributed variable $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, the probability of an observation falling within specific intervals is well-defined:\n- Approximately $68.27\\%$ of data points fall within $\\mu \\pm 1\\sigma$.\n- Approximately $95.45\\%$ of data points fall within $\\mu \\pm 2\\sigma$.\n- Approximately $99.73\\%$ of data points fall within $\\mu \\pm 3\\sigma$.\n\nThis implies that an observation outside the $\\mu \\pm 3\\sigma$ limits is a very rare event (probability $\\approx 1 - 0.9973 = 0.0027$, or about $1$ in $370$ occurrences) if the process is stable and in statistical control. Such an event strongly suggests that the underlying process has changed.\n\nDecision boundaries on a Shewhart chart are these $\\mu \\pm k\\sigma$ lines. They are used to differentiate between common cause variation (the inherent, random variability of a stable process) and special cause variation (unexpected changes due to specific, assignable causes). Westgard multirule QC employs a combination of decision criteria using these boundaries to enhance error detection while minimizing false rejections.\n\n- **Imprecision (Random Error):** This refers to an increase in the random scatter of measurements, corresponding to an increase in the process standard deviation, $\\sigma$. Larger random errors increase the likelihood of a single point falling far from the mean.\n- **Inaccuracy (Systematic Error):** This refers to a shift in the central tendency of the measurements, corresponding to a change in the process mean, $\\mu$. All measurements tend to be uniformly higher or lower than the established mean.\n\nThe specified Westgard rules are applied as follows:\n\n- **$1_{3s}$ Rule:** This rule is violated if one control measurement falls outside the $\\mu \\pm 3\\sigma$ limits. It is a rejection rule applied *within a single run*. A $1_{3s}$ violation signals a significant out-of-control condition, which could be caused by a large, abrupt systematic shift or a large random error. Due to the very low probability of a false alarm, this rule violation warrants immediate rejection of the run and investigation.\n\n- **$2_{2s}$ Rule:** This rule is violated when two consecutive control measurements exceed the same $\\mu + 2\\sigma$ or $\\mu - 2\\sigma$ limit. These $\\mu \\pm 2\\sigma$ lines act as \"warning\" limits. In the context of this problem, where a low-positive and a high-positive control are measured once per run, the rule is applied *across materials within the same run*. That is, the rule is violated if both the low-positive and high-positive controls in the same run fall above $\\mu + 2\\sigma$ or both fall below $\\mu - 2\\sigma$. This rule is particularly sensitive to detecting systematic error (inaccuracy), as a process shift would affect both control levels in the same direction.\n\n- **$R_{4s}$ Rule:** This is a *within-run* rejection rule applied when using at least two different control materials. It is violated if the range (the absolute difference) between the highest and lowest control measurements within the same run exceeds $4\\sigma$. This rule is specifically sensitive to random error (imprecision). A large difference between two control measurements made under nearly identical conditions suggests increased random variability in the measurement system, rather than a systematic shift that would affect both controls similarly.\n\n2. Derivation of Analytical Expressions\n\nLet the control mean be $\\mu$ and the standard deviation be $\\sigma$.\n\n- **$1_{3s}$ Rule Boundaries:** This rule flags a single measurement, $C$, that falls outside the $3\\sigma$ limits.\n  - The Upper Control Limit (UCL) is the boundary above which a violation occurs.\n    $$UCL_{1_{3s}} = \\mu + 3\\sigma$$\n  - The Lower Control Limit (LCL) is the boundary below which a violation occurs.\n    $$LCL_{1_{3s}} = \\mu - 3\\sigma$$\n\n- **$2_{2s}$ Rule Boundaries:** This rule uses the $2\\sigma$ limits as warning lines. The rule itself is a logical condition based on two points, but the boundaries are defined by these limits.\n  - The Upper Warning Limit (UWL) is:\n    $$UWL_{2_{2s}} = \\mu + 2\\sigma$$\n  - The Lower Warning Limit (LWL) is:\n    $$LWL_{2_{2s}} = \\mu - 2\\sigma$$\n  An analytical run is rejected if the two different controls in the current run ($C_{low}$ and $C_{high}$) satisfy either $(C_{low} > UWL_{2_{2s}} \\text{ and } C_{high} > UWL_{2_{2s}})$ or $(C_{low} < LWL_{2_{2s}} \\text{ and } C_{high} < LWL_{2_{2s}})$. The boundaries themselves are the expressions for the limits.\n\n- **$R_{4s}$ Rule Difference:** This rule evaluates the range $R$ between two control measurements, $C_{low}$ and $C_{high}$, within a single run. The range is defined as $R = |C_{high} - C_{low}|$. The rule is triggered if this range exceeds a specified limit.\n  - The minimum difference that triggers the rule is the control limit for the range, which is defined as $4\\sigma$. The condition is $R > 4\\sigma$. Therefore, the analytical expression for the minimum triggering difference, $\\Delta_{R_{4s}}$, is:\n    $$\\Delta_{R_{4s}} = 4\\sigma$$\n\n3. Calculation of Numerical Boundaries\n\nThe given values are $\\mu = 28$ and $\\sigma = 0.3$. All results are in units of cycles and must be rounded to four significant figures.\n\n- **$1_{3s}$ Rule Boundaries:**\n  - Upper boundary: $UCL_{1_{3s}} = \\mu + 3\\sigma = 28 + 3(0.3) = 28 + 0.9 = 28.9$. Rounded to four significant figures, this is $28.90$.\n  - Lower boundary: $LCL_{1_{3s}} = \\mu - 3\\sigma = 28 - 3(0.3) = 28 - 0.9 = 27.1$.

Rounded to four significant figures, this is $28.60$.\n  - Lower boundary: $LWL_{2_{2s}} = \\mu - 2\\sigma = 28 - 2(0.3) = 28 - 0.6 = 27.4$.
