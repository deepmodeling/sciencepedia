A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem asks for the relationship between the fixation time $t^{\\star}$ and the tissue half-thickness $L$. The most direct way to establish this relationship is through non-dimensional analysis of the governing system, as suggested by the problem statement.\n\nLet's introduce the following dimensionless variables:\n-   Dimensionless concentration: $c = \\frac{C}{C_{0}}$\n-   Dimensionless position: $\\xi = \\frac{x}{L}$\n-   Dimensionless time: $\\tau = \\frac{t}{T_{char}}$, where $T_{char}$ is a characteristic time scale.\n\nNow, we transform the governing partial differential equation (PDE) and its boundary/initial conditions into these dimensionless variables. We use the chain rule to transform the partial derivatives:\n$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial (c C_{0})}{\\partial (\\tau T_{char})} = \\frac{C_{0}}{T_{char}}\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial \\tau}$\n$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial (c C_{0})}{\\partial (\\xi L)} = \\frac{C_{0}}{L}\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial \\xi}$\n$\\frac{\\partial^{2} C}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{L}\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial \\xi}\\right) = \\frac{1}{L}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi}\\left(\\frac{C_{0}}{L}\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial \\xi}\\right) = \\frac{C_{0}}{L^{2}}\\frac{\\partial^{2} c}{\\partial \\xi^{2}}$\n\nSubstituting these into Fick's second law, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t}=D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} C}{\\partial x^{2}}$:\n$\\frac{C_{0}}{T_{char}}\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial \\tau} = D \\frac{C_{0}}{L^{2}}\\frac{\\partial^{2} c}{\\partial \\xi^{2}}$\n$\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial \\tau} = \\left(\\frac{D T_{char}}{L^{2}}\\right) \\frac{\\partial^{2} c}{\\partial \\xi^{2}}$\n\nTo simplify this equation into its canonical form, we choose the characteristic time $T_{char}$ such that the dimensionless group in the parentheses equals $1$:\n$\\frac{D T_{char}}{L^{2}} = 1 \\implies T_{char} = \\frac{L^{2}}{D}$\nThis specific choice defines the characteristic diffusion time for a system of length $L$ and diffusivity $D$. With this, our dimensionless time is $\\tau = \\frac{t D}{L^{2}}$, and the PDE becomes:\n$\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial \\tau} = \\frac{\\partial^{2} c}{\\partial \\xi^{2}}$\n\nThe domain $x \\in [0, L]$ becomes $\\xi \\in [0, 1]$. The boundary and initial conditions are transformed as follows:\n-   BC 1: $C(0, t) = C_{0} \\implies c(0, \\tau) C_{0} = C_{0} \\implies c(0, \\tau) = 1$.\n-   BC 2: $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}(L, t) = 0 \\implies \\frac{C_{0}}{L}\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial \\xi}(1, \\tau) = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial \\xi}(1, \\tau) = 0$.\n-   IC: $C(x, 0) = 0 \\implies c(\\xi, 0) C_{0} = 0 \\implies c(\\xi, 0) = 0$.\n\nThe condition for adequate fixation, $C(L, t^{\\star}) = \\alpha C_{0}$, becomes:\n$c(1, \\tau^{\\star}) C_{0} = \\alpha C_{0} \\implies c(1, \\tau^{\\star}) = \\alpha$\nwhere $\\tau^{\\star}$ is the dimensionless fixation time corresponding to the physical time $t^{\\star}$.\n\nThe complete non-dimensional problem is:\n-   PDE: $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial \\tau} = \\frac{\\partial^{2} c}{\\partial \\xi^{2}}$ for $\\xi \\in [0, 1]$.\n-   BCs: $c(0, \\tau) = 1$ and $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial \\xi}(1, \\tau) = 0$.\n-   IC: $c(\\xi, 0) = 0$.\n\nThe solution to this system, $c(\\xi, \\tau)$, is a universal function that depends only on the dimensionless variables $\\xi$ and $\\tau$. The fixation endpoint is reached when $c(1, \\tau^{\\star}) = \\alpha$. Since $\\alpha$ is a given constant, the value of $\\tau^{\\star}$ required to satisfy this condition is also a constant, let's call it $K_{\\alpha}$. This constant $K_{\\alpha}$ depends only on the value of $\\alpha$.\n$\\tau^{\\star} = K_{\\alpha}$\n\nNow, we relate the physical fixation time $t^{\\star}$ back to this dimensionless constant. From our definition of dimensionless time, $\\tau^{\\star} = \\frac{t^{\\star} D}{L^{2}}$.\nTherefore, we have:\n$\\frac{t^{\\star} D}{L^{2}} = K_{\\alpha}$\nSolving for $t^{\\star}$, we find the scaling relationship:\n$t^{\\star} = K_{\\alpha} \\frac{L^{2}}{D}$\n\nThis equation shows that the fixation time $t^{\\star}$ is directly proportional to the square of the half-thickness $L$ and inversely proportional to the diffusion coefficient $D$. Since $D$ and $\\alpha$ (and thus $K_{\\alpha}$) are the same for both protocols, we can write the relationship as $t^{\\star} \\propto L^{2}$.\n\nWe can now compute the required ratio. Let $t^{\\star}_{6~\\mathrm{mm}}$ be the fixation time for the $6~\\mathrm{mm}$ slice (with $L_{1} = 3~\\mathrm{mm}$) and $t^{\\star}_{3~\\mathrm{mm}}$ be the time for the $3~\\mathrm{mm}$ slice (with $L_{2} = 1.5~\\mathrm{mm}$):\n$t^{\\star}_{6~\\mathrm{mm}} = K_{\\alpha} \\frac{L_{1}^{2}}{D}$\n$t^{\\star}_{3~\\mathrm{mm}} = K_{\\alpha} \\frac{L_{2}^{2}}{D}$\n\nThe ratio is:\n$\\frac{t^{\\star}_{3~\\mathrm{mm}}}{t^{\\star}_{6~\\mathrm{mm}}} = \\frac{K_{\\alpha} \\frac{L_{2}^{2}}{D}}{K_{\\alpha} \\frac{L_{1}^{2}}{D}} = \\frac{L_{2}^{2}}{L_{1}^{2}} = \\left(\\frac{L_{2}}{L_{1}}\\right)^{2}$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values for the half-thicknesses:\n$L_{1} = 3~\\mathrm{mm}$\n$L_{2} = 1.5~\\mathrm{mm}$\n\n$\\frac{t^{\\star}_{3~\\mathrm{mm}}}{t^{\\star}_{6~\\mathrm{mm}}} = \\left(\\frac{1.5}{3}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nAs a real number, this ratio is $0.25$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.25}\n$$", "id": "5168852"}, {"introduction": "Following fixation, the reversal of formaldehyde-induced protein crosslinks is essential for unmasking antigenic epitopes for antibody binding.

In essence, a high buffer capacity signifies a strong resistance to $\\mathrm{pH}$ change. For a simple buffer system consisting of a single conjugate acid-base pair, the buffer capacity is maximal when the $\\mathrm{pH}$ is equal to the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ of the weak acid. At this point, the concentrations of the acid and its conjugate base are equal.\n\nIn the given problem, the buffer $\\mathrm{pH}$ is $6.0$, which is close to the relevant dissociation constant $\\mathrm{p}K_{a3} = 6.40$. The proximity of the operating $\\mathrm{pH}$ to the $\\mathrm{p}K_{a3}$ means that the buffer has substantial, though not maximal, capacity to resist $\\mathrm{pH}$ changes.\n\nThis property is critical for the reproducibility of HIER for several reasons:\n$1$. **pH Stability at High Temperature**: HIER is performed at elevated temperatures (typically $95-100\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$). The $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ values of buffer components are temperature-dependent. A buffer with high capacity will better resist the $\\mathrm{pH}$ shifts that occur upon heating, ensuring that the effective $\\mathrm{pH}$ during the retrieval process is stable and consistent between experiments.\n$2$. **Neutralization of Local pH Changes**: During the HIER process, chemical reactions within the tissue, such as the hydrolysis of formaldehyde crosslinks, can release acidic or basic moieties. These can create localized $\\mathrm{pH}$ gradients across the tissue section. A buffer with high capacity effectively neutralizes these products, maintaining a uniform $\\mathrm{pH}$ environment across the entire tissue specimen.\n$3$. **Standardization and Reproducibility**: The efficiency of antigen retrieval is highly sensitive to $\\mathrm{pH}$. Minor variations in $\\mathrm{pH}$ can lead to either incomplete crosslink reversal (if the $\\mathrm{pH}$ is suboptimal) or tissue/antigen damage (if the $\\mathrm{pH}$ drifts into a damaging range). By maintaining a stable $\\mathrm{pH}$, a buffer with high capacity such as citrate at $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$ ensures that the retrieval conditions are consistent from slide to slide and from run to run. This consistency is the foundation of reproducible IHC staining, leading to reliable diagnostic or research outcomes.\n\nIn summary, the substantial buffer capacity of $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ citrate at $\\mathrm{pH}=6.0$, derived from its proximity to $\\mathrm{p}K_{a3}$, is crucial for maintaining the stringent $\\mathrm{pH}$ control required for the HIER procedure, thereby ensuring the reproducibility and reliability of the IHC results.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.51}$$", "id": "5168807"}, {"introduction": "The 'heat' in Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER) is the primary energetic input driving the hydrolysis of epitope-masking crosslinks, but what is the quantitative relationship between temperature and retrieval efficiency?
