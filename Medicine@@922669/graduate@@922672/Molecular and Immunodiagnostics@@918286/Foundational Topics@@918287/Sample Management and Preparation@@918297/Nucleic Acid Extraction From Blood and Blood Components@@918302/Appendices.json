Guanidinium thiocyanate is a widely used chaotropic agent, silica membranes are a standard solid phase, and the concentrations and volumes are realistic for such a protocol. The principle of solute conservation is a fundamental law. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed.

A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the conservation of the amount of solute (GITC) before and after mixing. The amount of a solute in moles, $n$, in a solution is given by the product of its molar concentration, $C$, and the volume of the solution, $V$.\n$$n = C \\times V$$\n\nFirst, we establish the total amount of GITC, $n_{GITC, total}$, in moles before mixing. This is the sum of the GITC from the lysis buffer and the GITC from the blood.\n$$n_{GITC, total} = n_{GITC, buffer} + n_{GITC, blood}$$\nThe amount of GITC in the lysis buffer is:\n$$n_{GITC, buffer} = C_{buffer} \\times V_{buffer}$$\nThe problem states that the blood contributes a negligible amount of GITC, so we can set $n_{GITC, blood} \\approx 0$. Therefore, the total amount of GITC in the system is effectively equal to the amount in the lysis buffer.\n$$n_{GITC, total} \\approx C_{buffer} \\times V_{buffer}$$\n\nNext, we determine the final volume of the mixture, $V_{final}$. The problem specifies that volumes are additive.\n$$V_{final} = V_{blood} + V_{buffer}$$\n\nThe final concentration of GITC, $C_{final}$, is the total amount of GITC divided by the final volume.\n$$C_{final} = \\frac{n_{GITC, total}}{V_{final}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $n_{GITC, total}$ and $V_{final}$, we derive the formula for the final concentration:\n$$C_{final} = \\frac{C_{buffer} V_{buffer}}{V_{blood} + V_{buffer}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this formula. It is critical to ensure that the volume units are consistent.
