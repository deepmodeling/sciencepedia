The binding step has a binding efficiency $b$ defined as the fraction of $M_{0}$ that becomes captured on the membrane under the given ionic conditions. The wash step causes a fractional loss $w$ of the membrane-bound RNA because of partial desorption and shear. The elution step has an elution recovery $e$ defined as the fraction of the post-wash membrane-bound RNA that is released into the eluate.

The primary limiting factor is likely the low force, which fails to adequately compact the denatured proteins.

Given that the current protocol is failing, a \"compromise\" may not be sufficient. There is no such thing as \"excessive force\" in this context within the limits of the centrifuge; a higher force will always lead to better and faster separation. Option A uses the maximum available force to ensure the most complete separation possible, making it a more definitive solution than this compromise.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**. While this is an improvement, it is not the *most* effective or direct solution. Option A is superior because it maximizes the separating force, providing the highest likelihood of a complete and robust phase partition.\n\nConclusion: Option A is the only protocol that applies the principles of centrifugation in the most robust way to solve the stated problem without introducing new risks.
