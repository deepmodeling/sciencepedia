Therefore, it is deemed valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe adsorption process is described by the reversible reaction between a free surface site $S$ and a DNA molecule in solution $D$ to form an adsorbed complex $SD$:\n$$S + D \\rightleftharpoons SD$$\nAccording to the law of mass action, the association equilibrium constant, $K$, is given by the ratio of concentrations at equilibrium. Here, concentration is specified as mass concentration for the solute, $C$. We use $[S]$ and $[SD]$ to represent the surface concentrations of free and occupied sites, respectively.\n$$K = \\frac{[SD]}{[S] \\cdot C}$$\nThe fraction of occupied sites, $\\theta$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of occupied sites to the total concentration of sites, $[S_T]$.\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[SD]}{[S_T]}$$\nThe total concentration of sites is the sum of the concentrations of free and occupied sites:\n$$[S_T] = [S] + [SD]$$\nFrom these two relations, we can express $[SD]$ and $[S]$ in terms of $\\theta$ and $[S_T]$:\n$$[SD] = \\theta [S_T]$$\n$$[S] = [S_T] - [SD] = [S_T] - \\theta [S_T] = [S_T](1-\\theta)$$\nSubstituting these expressions for $[S]$ and $[SD]$ into the equilibrium constant equation:\n$$K = \\frac{\\theta [S_T]}{[S_T](1-\\theta) \\cdot C} = \\frac{\\theta}{(1-\\theta)C}$$\nThis equation relates the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ to the solute concentration $C$ and the equilibrium constant $K$. We are asked to derive an expression for $q$. First, we solve for $\\theta$:\n$$KC = \\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}$$\n$$KC(1-\\theta) = \\theta$$\n$$KC - KC\\theta = \\theta$$\n$$KC = \\theta + KC\\theta$$\n$$KC = \\theta(1+KC)$$\n$$\\theta = \\frac{KC}{1+KC}$$\nThis is the Langmuir isotherm equation. The problem states that the adsorbed mass per unit area, $q$, is related to the fractional occupancy by $q = q_{\\max}\\theta$. Substituting the expression for $\\theta$:\n$$q = q_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{KC}{1+KC} \\right)$$\nThis is the required expression for $q$ as a function of $q_{\\max}$, $K$, and $C$.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nThe given values are:\n$q_{\\max} = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$\n$K = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{\\mu g}$\n$C = 20\\,\\mathrm{ng}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$\n\nFirst, the concentration $C$ must be converted to units compatible with $K$, which are $\\mathrm{\\mu g}/\\mathrm{mL}$.\n$$C = 20\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{ng}}{\\mu\\mathrm{L}} = 20 \\times \\frac{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g}}{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mL}} = 20\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{\\mu g}}{\\mathrm{mL}}$$\nNext, we calculate the dimensionless product $KC$:\n$$KC = \\left(0.2\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{\\mu g}}\\right) \\times \\left(20\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{\\mu g}}{\\mathrm{mL}}\\right) = 4$$\nNow, substitute this value into the derived equation for $q$:\n$$q = q_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{KC}{1+KC} \\right) = (10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}) \\left( \\frac{4}{1+4} \\right)$$\n$$q = (10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}) \\left( \\frac{4}{5} \\right)$$\n$$q = \\frac{40}{5}\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$$\n$$q = 8\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$$\nThe resulting adsorbed mass per unit area on the silica is $8\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "5161611"}, {"introduction": "While theoretical models provide a baseline, real-world manufacturing and materials are subject to variation.

The provided absorbance values are realistic for contaminated DNA samples. The problem is objective, well-posed, and self-contained, presenting a common troubleshooting scenario in a molecular biology laboratory. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific principles. Soil as a source makes humic acid contamination a primary and realistic concern. Phenol is also a common laboratory reagent, and its carryover is a classic source of contamination with a known spectral signature. The problem is therefore **valid**.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Option Analysis\n\n**Principles of UV-Vis Spectrophotometry for Nucleic Acids:**\n1.  **Pure DNA:** Exhibits a maximum absorbance at $\\sim 260$ nm. The ratio of absorbances $A_{260}/A_{280}$ is a measure of purity with respect to protein contamination and is ideally $\\sim 1.8$ for dsDNA. The ratio $A_{260}/A_{230}$ is a measure of purity with respect to other contaminants like chaotropic salts or phenolates and is ideally $\\sim 2.0-2.2$.\n2.  **Protein Contamination:** Proteins absorb light at $280$ nm due to aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosine), lowering the $A_{260}/A_{280}$ ratio.\n3.  **Phenol Contamination:** Phenol has an absorbance maximum near $270$ nm and absorbs significantly at both $260$ nm and $280$ nm. Its carryover typically leads to a suppression of the $A_{260}/A_{280}$ ratio to values around $1.4-1.5$.\n4.  **Chaotropic Salt/Humic Acid Contamination:** Guanidine salts (used for binding) and humic acids (complex organic molecules from soil) absorb strongly at wavelengths below $240$ nm. Their presence leads to an artificially high $A_{230}$ reading and a severely depressed $A_{260}/A_{230}$ ratio.\n\n**Analysis of Eluates:**\nFirst, we calculate the purity ratios for both eluates.\n-   **Eluate 1:**\n    -   $A_{260}/A_{280} = 0.60 / 0.42 \\approx 1.43$\n    -   $A_{260}/A_{230} = 0.60 / 0.90 \\approx 0.67$\n-   **Eluate 2:**\n    -   $A_{260}/A_{280} = 0.70 / 0.42 \\approx 1.67$\n    -   $A_{260}/A_{230} = 0.70 / 1.40 = 0.50$\n\n**Contaminant Assignment:**\n-   **Eluate 1:** The $A_{260}/A_{280}$ ratio of $\\sim 1.43$ is characteristic of phenol contamination. The low $A_{260}/A_{230}$ ratio of $\\sim 0.67$ is also consistent with phenol, which has absorbance at $230$ nm. The spectral signature strongly points to **phenol** as the dominant contaminant.\n-   **Eluate 2:** The $A_{260}/A_{280}$ ratio of $\\sim 1.67$ is less severely affected than in Eluate 1. However, the $A_{260}/A_{230}$ ratio is extremely low ($0.50$), driven by a very high $A_{230}$ reading. This is the classic signature of extensive contamination by compounds absorbing in the low UV range. Given the sample source is soil, **humic acids** are the most probable cause. Humic acids are notorious for co-purifying with DNA from environmental samples and causing such spectral profiles.\n\n**Mechanistic Principles of Purification Modification:**\n-   **Silica Binding:** DNA binds to the silica membrane under high-salt (chaotropic) and dehydrating (ethanol) conditions.\n-   **Washing:** Wash steps utilize a high percentage of ethanol (e.g., $70-80\\%$) to maintain the dehydrated state (keeping DNA bound) while the aqueous component of the wash buffer removes salts and other soluble impurities.\n-   **Phenol Removal:** Phenol is an organic molecule soluble in ethanol. Insufficient washing can lead to its carryover. More extensive washing with an ethanol-based solution should remove it.\n-   **Humic Acid Removal:** Humic acids are complex and adhere strongly to silica. Standard ethanol washes are often insufficient. Their removal typically requires specialized wash buffers that alter pH or ionic strength to selectively disrupt their interaction with the silica matrix without eluting the DNA.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n**A. Eluate $1$: phenol contamination; add one additional on-column wash with $70\\%$ ethanol containing $15\\%$ isopropanol, then extend the dry spin to $2$ minutes before elution. Eluate $2$: humic acid co-adsorption; insert an intermediate low-$pH$, high-guanidine hydrochloride wash before two sequential $70{-}80\\%$ ethanol washes.**\n-   **Eluate 1 Analysis:** The diagnosis (phenol) is correct. The recommended modification is mechanistically sound. Adding isopropanol increases the organic character of the wash, improving the solubilization of residual phenol. An extra wash step increases removal efficiency. An extended dry spin is critical to evaporate the final traces of the ethanol-based wash buffer, preventing carryover of the solubilized phenol into the eluate.\n-   **Eluate 2 Analysis:** The diagnosis (humic acid) is correct. The proposed modification describes a specialized wash buffer. The high concentration of guanidine hydrochloride ensures the DNA remains bound to the silica column. Specific low-pH wash formulations are known to be effective in removing certain classes of PCR inhibitors, including humic substances, from soil extracts. While seemingly counterintuitive (humic acids are more soluble at high pH), this type of wash selectively disrupts humic-silica interactions in a way that standard ethanol washes do not. This reflects an advanced but valid protocol modification.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**. The diagnoses are accurate, and both recommended procedures are mechanistically sound and aligned with established practices for removing these specific contaminants.\n\n**B. Eluate $1$: humic acid contamination; add a basic wash of $0.1$ M sodium hydroxide followed by a single $70\\%$ ethanol wash. Eluate $2$: phenol contamination; skip ethanol washes and elute immediately to minimize phenol carryover.**\n-   **Analysis:** The contaminant diagnoses are reversed and are incorrect based on the spectral data. The proposed modification for Eluate 1 ($0.1$ M NaOH wash) is extremely risky, as high pH can lead to the elution of DNA from the silica column, causing yield loss. The proposal for Eluate 2 (skip washes) is fundamentally flawed; wash steps are essential for removing the binding salts. Skipping them guarantees massive salt contamination.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Eluate $1$: phenol contamination; replace the ethanol wash with $10$ mM Tris, $pH\\,9.5$, containing $30\\%$ ethanol to keep DNA bound while extracting phenol. Eluate $2$: humic acid contamination; add $10$ mM magnesium chloride in the wash to precipitate humics on-column.**\n-   **Analysis:** The diagnoses are correct. However, the proposed modification for Eluate 1 uses only $30\\%$ ethanol. This low ethanol concentration is insufficient to maintain the dehydrated conditions required to keep DNA bound to silica, and would likely lead to premature elution and significant DNA loss. For Eluate 2, precipitating contaminants *on the column* during a wash step is counterproductive; the goal of a wash is to remove contaminants *from* the column.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Eluate $1$: phenol contamination; perform a single pre-elution wash with $100\\%$ ethanol only. Eluate $2$: humic acid contamination; replace all washes with water to avoid residual salts that absorb at $230$ nm.**\n-   **Analysis:** The diagnoses are correct. However, the proposed modification for Eluate 1 ($100\\%$ ethanol wash) is suboptimal because pure ethanol is ineffective at washing away the inorganic salts from the binding buffer. This would lead to salt contamination. The proposal for Eluate 2 (wash with water) is catastrophic. Water is a low-salt buffer and is used for elution. Washing with water would immediately strip the DNA from the column, resulting in total sample loss.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, Option A is the only choice that correctly identifies both contaminants and proposes mechanistically sound and effective solutions to remove them.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5161598"}]}
