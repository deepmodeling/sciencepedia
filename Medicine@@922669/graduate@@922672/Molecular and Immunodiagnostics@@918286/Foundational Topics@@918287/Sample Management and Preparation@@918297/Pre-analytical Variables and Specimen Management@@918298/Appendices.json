It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n***\n\n### Derivation of the RCF-RPM Relationship\n\nThe derivation begins from the fundamental formula for centripetal acceleration, $a_c$, for an object in uniform circular motion:\n$$a_c = \\omega^2 r$$\nwhere $r$ is the radius of the circular path and $\\omega$ is the angular velocity of the object.\n\nThe angular velocity, $\\omega$, is typically measured in radians per second ($\\text{rad/s}$), while laboratory centrifuges operate based on Revolutions Per Minute (RPM). We must establish a conversion between these two quantities.\nA single revolution corresponds to an angular displacement of $2\\pi$ radians. One minute is equal to $60$ seconds. Therefore, the conversion is:\n$$ \\omega \\, (\\text{rad/s}) = \\text{RPM} \\, (\\text{rev/min}) \\times \\frac{2\\pi \\, \\text{rad}}{1 \\, \\text{rev}} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{min}}{60 \\, \\text{s}} = \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot \\text{RPM}}{60} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\omega$ into the centripetal acceleration equation yields:\n$$ a_c = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\cdot \\text{RPM}}{60}\\right)^2 r = \\frac{4\\pi^2 (\\text{RPM})^2 r}{3600} = \\frac{\\pi^2 (\\text{RPM})^2 r}{900} $$\nRelative Centrifugal Force (RCF) is defined as the dimensionless ratio of the centripetal acceleration, $a_c$, to the standard acceleration due to gravity, $g$ (where $g \\approx 9.80665 \\, \\text{m/s}^2$).\n$$ \\text{RCF} = \\frac{a_c}{g} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $a_c$ gives the general relationship:\n$$ \\text{RCF} = \\frac{\\pi^2 (\\text{RPM})^2 r}{900 g} $$\nThis equation is the fundamental conversion relationship. It is crucial that all units are consistent. For scientific calculations, SI units are standard, meaning $r$ must be in meters ($\\text{m}$) and $g$ in meters per second squared ($\\text{m/s}^2$).\n\n### Justification of Effective Radius\nIn a centrifuge rotor, particularly a fixed-angle rotor, a sample tube holds a liquid column of finite height. The particles within the liquid are not all at the same distance from the axis of rotation. The particles at the top of the liquid column (meniscus) are at a minimum radius, $r_{\\text{min}}$, while particles that sediment to the bottom of the tube are at a maximum radius, $r_{\\text{max}}$. Since centripetal acceleration $a_c = \\omega^2 r$ is directly proportional to the radius $r$, the RCF experienced by the sample varies along the length of the tube.\n\nTo specify a single representative RCF for a given run, an \"effective radius\" must be used. Choosing $r_{\\text{min}}$ or $r_{\\text{max}}$ would systematically under- or overestimate the centrifugal field for the bulk of the sample. The most logical and standard choice is the radius to the midpoint of the liquid column:\n$$ r_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{r_{\\text{min}} + r_{\\text{max}}}{2} $$\nThis choice represents the arithmetic mean of the radii experienced by the sample. The RCF calculated using $r_{\\text{eff}}$ corresponds to the centrifugal force at the physical center of the sample volume, providing a justifiable average value for the entire specimen.\n\n### Dependence of RPM on Rotor Radius\nTo analyze the dependence of RPM on the rotor radius $r$, we rearrange the derived RCF formula to solve for RPM:\n$$ (\\text{RPM})^2 = \\frac{900 g \\cdot \\text{RCF}}{\\pi^2 r} $$\n$$ \\text{RPM} = \\sqrt{\\frac{900 g \\cdot \\text{RCF}}{\\pi^2 r}} = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{g \\cdot \\text{RCF}}{r}} $$\nFrom this relationship, for a desired constant RCF, the required RPM is inversely proportional to the square root of the radius:\n$$ \\text{RPM} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r}} $$\nThis means that to achieve the same RCF, a centrifuge with a larger rotor radius requires a lower rotational speed (RPM) than one with a smaller rotor radius.\n\n### Calculation of Required RPM\nWe are given the following values:\n- Desired RCF: $1800$ (this is a dimensionless value, representing $1800 \\times g$)\n- Effective sample radius: $r = 14.2 \\, \\text{cm}$\n- Standard gravitational acceleration: $g \\approx 9.80665 \\, \\text{m/s}^2$\n\nFirst, convert the radius to SI units (meters) to ensure consistency with the value of $g$:\n$$ r = 14.2 \\, \\text{cm} = 0.142 \\, \\text{m} $$\nNow, substitute these values into the derived formula for RPM. Note that RCF is the dimensionless value 1800.\n$$ \\text{RPM} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{RCF} \\cdot 900 \\cdot g}{\\pi^2 \\cdot r}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1800 \\cdot 900 \\cdot 9.80665}{\\pi^2 \\cdot 0.142}} $$\nAlternatively, using the rearranged formula from the derivation:\n$$ \\text{RPM} = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{RCF} \\cdot g}{r}} = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{1800 \\times 9.80665 \\, \\text{m/s}^2}{0.142 \\, \\text{m}}} $$\nFirst, we evaluate the expression inside the square root:\n$$ \\frac{1800 \\times 9.80665}{0.142} \\approx \\frac{17651.97}{0.142} \\approx 124309.6479 \\, \\text{s}^{-2} $$\nNext, take the square root of this value:\n$$ \\sqrt{124309.6479 \\, \\text{s}^{-2}} \\approx 352.57573 \\, \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nFinally, multiply by the constant pre-factor:\n$$ \\text{RPM} = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\times 352.57573 \\approx 9.54929658 \\times 352.57573 \\approx 3366.8688 $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{RPM} \\approx 3367 $$\nThus, to achieve an RCF of $1800 \\times g$ with a rotor radius of $14.2 \\, \\text{cm}$, the centrifuge must be set to approximately $3367$ revolutions per minute.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3367}$$", "id": "5149292"}, {"introduction": "Hemolysis, the release of hemoglobin from red blood cells, is a frequent source of pre-analytical error that can interfere with immunoassays and molecular tests.

Let $A_{s,\\lambda}$ be the raw sample absorbance and $A_{b,\\lambda}$ be the blank absorbance at wavelength $\\lambda$. The blank-corrected absorbance, $A'_{\\lambda}$, is:\n$$A'_{\\lambda} = A_{s,\\lambda} - A_{b,\\lambda}$$\nUsing the provided data:\nFor the Soret band at $\\lambda = 415$ $\\mathrm{nm}$:\n$$A'_{415} = A_{s,415} - A_{b,415} = 0.315 - 0.008 = 0.307$$\nFor the reference wavelength at $\\lambda = 700$ $\\mathrm{nm}$:\n$$A'_{700} = A_{s,700} - A_{b,700} = 0.021 - 0.006 = 0.015$$\n\nStep 2: Correction for Turbidity\nThe measurement at $700$ $\\mathrm{nm}$ is used to estimate the absorbance contribution from light scattering (turbidity), as hemoglobin has negligible absorbance at this wavelength. The problem specifies treating this turbidity as a wavelength-independent background. Therefore, the blank-corrected absorbance at $700$ $\\mathrm{nm}$, $A'_{700}$, can be subtracted from the blank-corrected absorbance at $415$ $\\mathrm{nm}$, $A'_{415}$, to isolate the absorbance due solely to hemoglobin, $A_{\\mathrm{Hb}}$.\n$$A_{\\mathrm{Hb}} = A'_{415} - A'_{700} = 0.307 - 0.015 = 0.292$$\nThis value, $A_{\\mathrm{Hb}} = 0.292$, represents the true absorbance of hemoglobin in the diluted sample measured in the cuvette.\n\nStep 3: Calculation of Hemoglobin Concentration in the Diluted Sample\nWe now apply the Beer-Lambert law to find the molar concentration of hemoglobin in the diluted sample, $c_{\\mathrm{diluted}}$.\n$$A_{\\mathrm{Hb}} = \\epsilon_{415} c_{\\mathrm{diluted}} l$$\nSolving for $c_{\\mathrm{diluted}}$:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{diluted}} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{Hb}}}{\\epsilon_{415} l}$$\nThe given values are:\n- $A_{\\mathrm{Hb}} = 0.292$ (dimensionless)\n- $\\epsilon_{415} = 1.24 \\times 10^{5}$ $\\mathrm{L \\, mol^{-1} \\, cm^{-1}}$\n- $l = 1.00$ $\\mathrm{cm}$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{diluted}} = \\frac{0.292}{(1.24 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\mathrm{L \\, mol^{-1} \\, cm^{-1}}) \\times (1.00 \\, \\mathrm{cm})} = \\frac{0.292}{1.24 \\times 10^{5}} \\, \\mathrm{mol \\, L^{-1}}$$\n$$c_{\\mathrm{diluted}} \\approx 2.3548 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{mol \\, L^{-1}}$$\n\nStep 4: Calculation of Hemoglobin Concentration in the Original Sample\nThe measurement was performed on a sample diluted by a factor of $D = 10$.
