The provided values are realistic for a laboratory setting. We will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an analytical expression for the rotational speed $N$ in revolutions per minute (rpm) as a function of the relative centrifugal force (RCF), the rotor radius ($r$), and the standard gravitational acceleration ($g$). Subsequently, this expression will be evaluated for the given numerical values. The derivation will begin from the fundamental principles specified.\n\nFirst, we state the three fundamental principles:\n1.  The centripetal acceleration, $a_c$, experienced by a sample rotating at an angular velocity $\\omega$ (in radians per second) at a radius $r$ from the center of rotation is given by the formula:\n    $$a_c = \\omega^2 r$$\n2.  The Relative Centrifugal Force, RCF, is a dimensionless quantity that compares the centripetal acceleration to the standard acceleration due to gravity, $g$. It is defined as:\n    $$RCF = \\frac{a_c}{g}$$\n3.  The kinematic relationship between angular velocity $\\omega$ in radians per second (rad/s) and the rotational speed $N$ in revolutions per minute (rpm) is derived from the fact that one revolution corresponds to $2\\pi$ radians and one minute contains $60$ seconds.\n    $$N \\left[\\frac{\\text{rev}}{\\text{min}}\\right] = \\omega \\left[\\frac{\\text{rad}}{\\text{s}}\\right] \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ rev}}{2\\pi \\text{ rad}} \\times \\frac{60 \\text{ s}}{1 \\text{ min}}$$\n    This simplifies to a relationship between the numerical values of $N$ and $\\omega$:\n    $$N = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\omega$$\n\nNow, we derive the expression for $N$. We begin by substituting the expression for $a_c$ from the first principle into the definition of RCF from the second principle:\n$$RCF = \\frac{\\omega^2 r}{g}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the angular velocity, $\\omega$.\n$$\\omega^2 = \\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}$$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives $\\omega$:\n$$\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}}$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $\\omega$ into the kinematic relationship for $N$:\n$$N = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}}$$\nThis is the desired analytical expression for the rotational speed in rpm.\n\nNext, we verify the dimensional consistency of the derived expression. The rotational speed $N$ has dimensions of inverse time, $[T^{-1}]$. Let's analyze the dimensions of the right-hand side of the equation. RCF is dimensionless, so $[RCF] = 1$. The dimension of $g$ is length per time squared, $[g] = L T^{-2}$. The dimension of radius $r$ is length, $[r] = L$. The pre-factor $\\frac{30}{\\pi}$ is a dimensionless conversion constant.\nThe dimensions of the term inside the square root are:\n$$\\left[\\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}\\right] = \\frac{[RCF][g]}{[r]} = \\frac{1 \\cdot L T^{-2}}{L} = T^{-2}$$\nTaking the square root gives:\n$$\\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}}\\right] = \\sqrt{T^{-2}} = T^{-1}$$\nThe dimensions of the right-hand side are $[T^{-1}]$, which match the dimensions of the left-hand side ($N$). Therefore, the expression is dimensionally consistent.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the expression numerically. The given values are:\n$RCF = 12000$ (dimensionless)\n$r = 7.5 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$\n$g = 9.80665 \\, \\mathrm{m \\, s^{-2}}$\n\nFor consistency, all units must be in the International System of Units (SI). We convert the radius $r$ from centimeters to meters:\n$r = 7.5 \\, \\mathrm{cm} = 0.075 \\, \\mathrm{m}$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived formula for $N$:\n$$N = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{12000 \\times 9.80665 \\, \\mathrm{m \\, s^{-2}}}{0.075 \\, \\mathrm{m}}}$$\nFirst, calculate the value inside the square root:\n$$\\frac{12000 \\times 9.80665}{0.075} = \\frac{117679.8}{0.075} = 1569064 \\, \\mathrm{s^{-2}}$$\nNow, take the square root:\n$$\\sqrt{1569064 \\, \\mathrm{s^{-2}}} \\approx 1252.62285 \\, \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\nThis value represents the angular velocity $\\omega$ in radians per second. Now, we convert this to rpm:\n$$N \\approx \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\times 1252.62285 \\approx 9.54929658 \\times 1252.62285 \\approx 11961.59 \\, \\text{rpm}$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem with a clear objective and sufficient data. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Sedimentation Velocity\nThe problem states that the particle moves at a steady velocity $v$. According to Newton's second law, this implies that the net force acting on the particle is zero.\n$$ \\sum \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{0} $$\nWe consider the forces acting on the particle along the radial direction in the rotating frame. Let the radially outward direction be positive. The three forces are the centrifugal force ($F_c$), the buoyant force ($F_b$), and the viscous drag force ($F_d$).\n\n$1$. **Centrifugal Force ($F_c$)**: This is the effective force driving the particle radially outward. It is given by the particle's mass, $m_p$, times the centrifugal acceleration, $a_{cent} = \\omega^2 r$.\nThe particle is a sphere of radius $a$, so its volume is $V_p = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3$. Its mass is $m_p = \\rho_p V_p$.\n$$ F_c = m_p \\omega^2 r = \\left(\\rho_p \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3\\right) \\omega^2 r $$\n\n$2$. **Buoyant Force ($F_b$)**: According to Archimedes' principle, in a centrifugal field, the buoyant force is equal to the centrifugal force on the mass of the fluid displaced by the particle. This force acts radially inward, opposing the centrifugal force on the particle. The mass of the displaced fluid is $m_f = \\rho_f V_p$.\n$$ F_b = m_f \\omega^2 r = \\left(\\rho_f \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3\\right) \\omega^2 r $$\n\n$3$. **Viscous Drag Force ($F_d$)**: As the particle moves radially outward with steady velocity $v$ relative to the fluid, it experiences a viscous drag force that opposes its motion. For a sphere in a low Reynolds number regime (creeping flow), this force is given by Stokes' law. The force acts radially inward.\n$$ F_d = 6\\pi\\eta a v $$\n\nThe condition for steady velocity is that the sum of these forces is zero.\n$$ \\sum F_{radial} = F_c - F_b - F_d = 0 $$\nTherefore, the net outward force is balanced by the drag force:\n$$ F_c - F_b = F_d $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the forces:\n$$ \\left(\\rho_p \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3\\right) \\omega^2 r - \\left(\\rho_f \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3\\right) \\omega^2 r = 6\\pi\\eta a v $$\nWe can factor the left-hand side:\n$$ (\\rho_p - \\rho_f) \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3\\right) \\omega^2 r = 6\\pi\\eta a v $$\nNow, we solve for the sedimentation velocity, $v$:\n$$ v = \\frac{(\\rho_p - \\rho_f) \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi a^3\\right) \\omega^2 r}{6\\pi\\eta a} $$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling terms: $\\pi$ cancels out; $a$ in the denominator cancels with one of the $a$'s in $a^3$, leaving $a^2$; the numerical constant becomes $\\frac{4/3}{6} = \\frac{4}{18} = \\frac{2}{9}$.\nThis yields the final symbolic expression for the steady-state sedimentation velocity:\n$$ v = \\frac{2 a^2 (\\rho_p - \\rho_f) \\omega^2 r}{9 \\eta} $$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nNext, we compute the value of $v$ using the provided data.
