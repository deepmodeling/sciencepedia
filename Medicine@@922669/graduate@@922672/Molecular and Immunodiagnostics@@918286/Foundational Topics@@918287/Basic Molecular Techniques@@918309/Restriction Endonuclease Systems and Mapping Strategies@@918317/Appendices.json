This is a fundamental and well-established technique in molecular biology. The principles invoked are scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a set of experimental results (band sizes) and asks for the deduction of the underlying physical map (restriction site locations). The provided data is specific and the constraints (ordering of sites) are clear.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective terminology standard to the field of molecular biology. The data is purely quantitative.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The core of the validation is to check if the provided data is consistent and sufficient.\n  - The molecule is linear with length $L=10$ kb.\n  - It is labeled at one end (the left terminus, defined as position $0$).\n  - A partial digest will generate a series of labeled fragments. Since the label is only at the left end, all detected fragments must start at position $0$.\n  - These fragments will terminate either at a cut site or at the far end of the molecule (if uncut).\n  - Let the three restriction sites be at positions $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ from the labeled end. The expected set of labeled fragments will have lengths corresponding to these positions, plus the length of the full, uncut molecule.\n  - Thus, the theoretical set of observed band sizes is $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, L\\}$.\n  - The experimentally observed set of band sizes is given as $\\{2, 5, 8, 10\\}$.\n  - Equating these two sets, $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, L\\} = \\{2, 5, 8, 10\\}$.\n  - Given $L=10$ kb, the $10$ kb band in the data corresponds to the full-length, uncut molecule. This is consistent.\n  - The remaining band sizes, $\\{2, 5, 8\\}$, must correspond to the set of restriction site positions, $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$.\n  - The ordering constraint $0 < x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < L$ can be satisfied by assigning $x_1=2$, $x_2=5$, and $x_3=8$, which gives $0 < 2 < 5 < 8 < 10$.\n  - The problem is therefore self-contained, internally consistent, and possesses a unique solution based on the provided information.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n- **Verdict**: The problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains sufficient, consistent information for a unique solution.\n- **Action**: Proceed with a detailed solution.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the positions of three restriction sites for an endonuclease X on a linear DNA molecule. The method employed is partial digestion followed by analysis of end-labeled fragments.\n\nLet the linear DNA molecule be represented by a coordinate system starting at $0$ at the labeled left terminus and ending at position $L$ at the right terminus. We are given that the total length of the molecule is $L=10$ kb.\n\nThere are exactly three recognition sites for the restriction enzyme X. Let their ordered positions from the left end be $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$. According to the problem statement, these positions must satisfy the condition:\n$$0 < x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < L$$\n\nThe DNA is uniquely end-labeled at its left terminus (position $0$). A partial digestion is performed, which means that on any given molecule, the enzyme may cut at none, one, two, or all three of the available sites. Since the probability of cutting is low and independent at each site, a population of DNA molecules will yield a mixture of different cleavage products.\n\nAfter digestion, the fragments are separated by gel electrophoresis, and only the fragments containing the label from the left terminus are visualized by autoradiography. The size of a labeled fragment is equal to the distance from the labeled end (position $0$) to the point of cleavage.\n\nThe possible labeled fragments are generated as follows:\n1.  A fragment is produced by a cut at the first site, $x_1$. This fragment extends from position $0$ to $x_1$, and its length is $x_1$.\n2.  A fragment is produced by a cut at the second site, $x_2$, provided the first site at $x_1$ was not cut on that same molecule. This fragment extends from position $0$ to $x_2$, and its length is $x_2$.\n3.  A fragment is produced by a cut at the third site, $x_3$, provided the sites at $x_1$ and $x_2$ were not cut on that same molecule. This fragment extends from position $0$ to $x_3$, and its length is $x_3$.\n4.  If a molecule is not cut at any of the three sites, the full-length molecule remains. This molecule is labeled at its end and will be detected as a fragment of length $L$.\n\nTherefore, the set of all possible sizes for the labeled fragments is $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, L\\}$.\n\nThe problem states that electrophoresis and autoradiography revealed a set of labeled bands with sizes (in kb) given by $\\{2, 5, 8, 10\\}$. This experimental result must correspond to the theoretical set of fragment sizes.\n$$ \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, L\\} = \\{2, 5, 8, 10\\} $$\n\nWe are given that the total length of the DNA is $L=10$ kb. This accounts for the largest observed band of $10$ kb, which represents the uncut DNA molecules.\nBy removing $L=10$ from both sets, we are left with the correspondence for the restriction site positions:\n$$ \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\} = \\{2, 5, 8\\} $$\n\nThe problem imposes a strict ordering on the positions of the sites: $x_1 < x_2 < x_3$. To satisfy this condition, we must assign the values from the set $\\{2, 5, 8\\}$ in ascending order:\n- $x_1$ must be the smallest value, so $x_1 = 2$ kb.\n- $x_2$ must be the middle value, so $x_2 = 5$ kb.\n- $x_3$ must be the largest value, so $x_3 = 8$ kb.\n\nWe verify this solution against the ordering constraint: $0 < 2 < 5 < 8 < 10$. The condition holds.\nThus, the ordered positions of the three restriction sites are $2$ kb, $5$ kb, and $8$ kb from the labeled left end.\n\nThe final answer is required as a single ordered row matrix $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$.\nThe positions are $(2, 5, 8)$ in units of kilobases.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 5 & 8 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5156358"}, {"introduction": "Restriction mapping evolves into a puzzle of logical deduction when applied to circular DNA, such as a plasmid, using multiple enzymes.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. I will proceed to derive the solution and evaluate each option.\n\n### Analysis of a Valid Problem Statement\n\nLet $L = 10$ kb be the total length of the circular plasmid. Let $F_A = \\{2, 3, 5\\}$ be the set of fragment lengths from the enzyme A digest, and $F_B = \\{1, 4, 5\\}$ be the set of fragment lengths from the enzyme B digest.\n\n**A. Each enzyme must have exactly $3$ recognition sites on the plasmid.**\nThe problem states as a foundational property that for a circular DNA molecule, the number of restriction fragments is equal to the number of recognition sites.\n- The digest with enzyme A yields $|F_A| = 3$ fragments. Therefore, enzyme A must have exactly $3$ recognition sites.\n- The digest with enzyme B yields $|F_B| = 3$ fragments. Therefore, enzyme B must have exactly $3$ recognition sites.\nThis statement is a direct application of the provided principles to the given data.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For each single digest, the fragment sizes must sum to $10$ kb, and the given sets $\\{2,3,5\\}$ and $\\{1,4,5\\}$ are valid partitions of $10$.**\nThe problem states that the sum of fragment lengths must equal the genome length. The genome length is given as $10$ kb.\n- For enzyme A: The sum of fragment sizes is $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$ kb.\n- For enzyme B: The sum of fragment sizes is $1 + 4 + 5 = 10$ kb.\nBoth sums match the total plasmid length. A partition of a positive integer is a way of writing it as a sum of positive integers. The sets $\\{2,3,5\\}$ and $\\{1,4,5\\}$ are indeed representations of partitions of the integer $10$. The statement correctly verifies that the given data is consistent with the stated principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. For each enzyme considered alone, and ignoring overall rotation and reflection of the circular map, the circular order of the three fragment arc lengths is uniquely determined by the multiset of lengths; specifically, enzyme A’s arcs of lengths $2$, $3$, and $5$ have a single non-equivalent circular ordering, and similarly for enzyme B’s arcs of lengths $1$, $4$, and $5$.**\nThis statement concerns the combinatorics of circular permutations (necklaces). The number of distinct circular arrangements of $n$ objects, equivalent up to rotation and reflection, is given by Burnside's Lemma or by the formula $\\frac{1}{2}( (n-1)! + ...)$, which simplifies for $n$ distinct objects.\nFor $n$ distinct objects, the number of linear permutations is $n!$. The number of circular permutations (ignoring rotation) is $(n-1)!$. If we also ignore reflection (treating clockwise and counter-clockwise as the same), the number of unique arrangements is $(n-1)!/2$ for $n > 2$.\n- For enzyme A, the fragment lengths are $\\{2, 3, 5\\}$. These are $n=3$ distinct lengths. The number of unique, non-equivalent circular orderings is $(3-1)!/2 = 2/2 = 1$.\n- For enzyme B, the fragment lengths are $\\{1, 4, 5\\}$. These are also $n=3$ distinct lengths. The number of unique, non-equivalent circular orderings is also $(3-1)!/2 = 1$.\nThe statement is a correct application of combinatorial principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. At least one recognition site of enzyme A must coincide exactly (be at the same position) with a recognition site of enzyme B, because both single digests contain a $5$ kb fragment.**\nThis statement claims that a common fragment length necessitates a common recognition site. To test this \"must hold\" claim, we only need to find one valid counterexample. Let's attempt to construct a map where no sites coincide.\nLet the A-sites be located at positions $\\{0, 2, 5\\}$ on the $10$ kb circle. The fragments are the arc lengths between these sites: $2-0 = 2$ kb, $5-2 = 3$ kb, and $10-5 = 5$ kb. This is consistent with $F_A = \\{2, 3, 5\\}$.\nNow, let's try to place the B-sites such that they do not fall on $\\{0, 2, 5\\}$ and produce fragments consistent with $F_B = \\{1, 4, 5\\}$. Consider placing B-sites at $\\{1, 6, 7\\}$. None of these positions coincide with an A-site. The fragments produced are the arc lengths between these B-sites: $6-1 = 5$ kb, $7-6 = 1$ kb, and $(10-7)+1 = 4$ kb. This set of fragments is $\\{1, 4, 5\\}$, which is consistent with $F_B$.\nSince we have constructed a valid arrangement of A-sites $\\{0, 2, 5\\}$ and B-sites $\\{1, 6, 7\\}$ where no sites coincide, the statement that at least one site *must* coincide is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. No combined arrangement of the six sites can avoid subdivision of at least one enzyme A fragment by enzyme B sites in a hypothetical Double Digest (DD); equivalently, there is no possible interleaving in which each $A$ fragment equals the sum of lengths of one or more whole $B$ fragments without cutting any $B$ fragment internally.**\nThis statement asserts that in any valid combined map, at least one B-site must lie strictly between two consecutive A-sites. Let's test this by assuming the contrary and seeking a contradiction.\nAssume there exists a valid combined map where NO enzyme A fragment is subdivided by any enzyme B site. This means that for any pair of consecutive A-sites, the arc between them contains no B-sites. This implies that every B-site must be located at the same position as an A-site.\nLet $S_A$ be the set of A-site positions and $S_B$ be the set of B-site positions. The assumption implies $S_B \\subseteq S_A$.\nFrom statement A, we know $|S_A| = 3$ and $|S_B| = 3$.\nIf $S_B \\subseteq S_A$ and $|S_A| = |S_B|$, it must be that $S_A = S_B$.\nIf the set of recognition sites for both enzymes is identical, then a single digest with either enzyme A or enzyme B would cut the plasmid at the exact same locations, necessarily producing the exact same set of fragments.\nHowever, the given fragment sets are $F_A = \\{2, 3, 5\\}$ and $F_B = \\{1, 4, 5\\}$. Since $F_A \\neq F_B$, we have a contradiction.\nThe initial assumption must be false. Therefore, in any valid combined map, at least one A-fragment must be subdivided by a B-site.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. The presence of the $1$ kb fragment in enzyme B’s single digest implies a $1$ kb segment between two B sites that cannot contain any enzyme A site if the single digest data for both enzymes are to remain consistent.**\nThis statement claims that the smallest fragment in either digest (the $1$ kb B-fragment) must be an elementary fragment in the double digest, i.e., it cannot be cut further by the other enzyme. To disprove this, we need to show that it is possible to construct a valid map where an A-site does cut the $1$ kb B-fragment.\nLet's consider the non-common fragments. The A-digest has $\\{2, 3\\}$ kb fragments and the B-digest has $\\{1, 4\\}$ kb fragments, which add up to $5$ kb in both cases. Let's assume the $5$ kb fragments are the same region in a potential map, and analyze the remaining $5$ kb region.\nThis $5$ kb region must be partitionable into $\\{2, 3\\}$ by A-sites and $\\{1, 4\\}$ by B-sites. Let the double-digest fragments in this region be represented by sets of lengths $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$ whose sums correspond to the different partitions. Let $s(P_i)$ be the sum of lengths in set $P_i$.\n$s(P_1)+s(P_2) = 2$ (A-fragment)\n$s(P_3)+s(P_4) = 3$ (A-fragment)\n$s(P_1)+s(P_3) = 1$ (B-fragment)\n$s(P_2)+s(P_4) = 4$ (B-fragment)\nThis system of linear equations in $s(P_i)$ is consistent. We can find non-negative solutions. For the $1$ kb B-fragment to be cut by an A-site, it must be composed of a piece from one A-fragment and a piece from another. In our model, this means the sets $P_1$ (part of A-frag 2) and $P_3$ (part of A-frag 3) must both be non-empty, i.e., $s(P_1)>0$ and $s(P_3)>0$.\nFrom the equations, $s(P_3) = 1 - s(P_1)$. The condition $s(P_3)>0$ implies $s(P_1) < 1$.\nSo, any solution with $0 < s(P_1) < 1$ represents a valid arithmetic model where the $1$ kb B-fragment is cut by an A-site.\nLet's choose $s(P_1) = 0.5$. Then:\n$s(P_2) = 2 - 0.5 = 1.5$\n$s(P_3) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$\n$s(P_4) = 4 - 1.5 = 2.5$ (or $3 - 0.5 = 2.5$).\nThis is a consistent set of sums. We can realize this with a set of double-digest fragments $\\{0.5, 1.5, 0.5, 2.5\\}$ (summing to $5$) plus one more fragment of length $5$ (the common fragment). This set $\\{0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 5\\}$ sums to $10$. It can be partitioned to form A-fragments $\\{ \\{0.5,1.5\\}, \\{0.5,2.5\\}, \\{5\\} \\} = \\{2,3,5\\}$ and B-fragments $\\{ \\{0.5,0.5\\}, \\{1.5,2.5\\}, \\{5\\} \\} = \\{1,4,5\\}$.\nThe existence of this arithmetically consistent model, where the $1$ kb fragment is composed of two $0.5$ kb pieces separated by an A-site, demonstrates that it is possible for the $1$ kb fragment to be cut. Therefore, the statement that it *cannot* be cut is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCE}$$", "id": "5156332"}, {"introduction": "A theoretical map is only as good as the experimental protocol used to verify it, and real-world enzymes often present practical challenges.

The specified enzyme properties are realistic and analogous to common, well-characterized enzymes (e.g., $E_A$ resembles EcoRI, $E_B$ resembles XhoI). The buffer compositions, enzyme concentrations, reaction conditions, and inhibition profiles are all scientifically plausible and represent a typical real-world scenario of buffer incompatibility. The problem is firmly grounded in established molecular biology principles.\n\n- **Well-Posed and Objective:** The problem is well-posed, asking for the optimal protocol from a given set of choices based on a comprehensive list of constraints. The question is objective, and the provided data is sufficient to quantitatively evaluate each option and arrive at a single best answer. The language is precise and technical.\n\n- **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The provided information is self-consistent. Let's verify the numbers.\n    - DNA volume needed: $\\frac{2.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}}{100\\,\\mathrm{ng}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}} = \\frac{2500\\,\\mathrm{ng}}{100\\,\\mathrm{ng}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}} = 25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$.\n    - Enzyme units needed: $2.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g} \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{U}/\\mu\\mathrm{g} = 25\\,\\mathrm{U}$.\n    - Enzyme volume needed: $\\frac{25\\,\\mathrm{U}}{20\\,\\mathrm{U}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}} = 1.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$.\n    - Glycerol contribution per enzyme addition in a $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ reaction: The enzyme adds $1.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ of a $50\\%$ glycerol stock. The volume of glycerol is $1.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L} \\times 0.50 = 0.625\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. The final percentage in a $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ reaction is $\\frac{0.625\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}}{50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}} \\times 100\\% = 1.25\\%$. This value is well below the specified $\\leq 5\\%$ limit, so star activity from glycerol is not a primary concern with this setup.\nThe data are complete and free of contradictions.\n\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem is realistic, solvable, and not trivial. It requires a systematic application of the given biophysical constraints.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires two stages: first, calculating the expected fragment sizes from a correct double digest, and second, evaluating each proposed protocol against the given biochemical constraints.\n\n**1. Calculation of Expected Fragment Sizes**\n\nThe plasmid is a circular DNA molecule with a total length of $L = 7.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$. The restriction sites are given as clockwise distances from the origin: $C_A = 1.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ for enzyme $E_A$ and $C_B = 6.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ for enzyme $E_B$. A double digest will cleave the circle at both sites, generating two fragments.\n\n- The length of the first fragment is the distance along the circle between the two sites in one direction. Traveling clockwise from $E_A$ to $E_B$, the length is:\n$$ \\text{Fragment}_1 = C_B - C_A = 6.2\\,\\mathrm{kb} - 1.1\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 5.1\\,\\mathrm{kb} $$\n\n- The length of the second fragment is the remaining part of the circle, calculated by taking the total length and subtracting the first fragment's length:\n$$ \\text{Fragment}_2 = L - \\text{Fragment}_1 = 7.2\\,\\mathrm{kb} - 5.1\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 2.1\\,\\mathrm{kb} $$\n\nAlternatively, this can be calculated as the distance from $E_B$ clockwise back to $E_A$, which is $(L - C_B) + C_A = (7.2\\,\\mathrm{kb} - 6.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}) + 1.1\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{kb} + 1.1\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 2.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$.\n\nThe sum of the fragments is $5.1\\,\\mathrm{kb} + 2.1\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 7.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$, which correctly equals the total plasmid length. A successful double digest must yield fragments of $5.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ and $2.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$.\n\n**2. Analysis of Protocol Options**\n\nThe critical issue is the incompatibility of the buffers. Enzyme $E_A$ requires low salt (Buffer $A$: $50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{NaCl}$) and is inhibited by high $\\mathrm{KCl}$ concentrations ($[\\mathrm{KCl}] \\geq 40\\,\\mathrm{mM}$). Enzyme $E_B$ requires high salt (Buffer $B$: $100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{KCl}$) and is inhibited by $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ ($[\\mathrm{NaCl}] \\geq 30\\,\\mathrm{mM}$).\n\n**Option A Analysis:**\n1.  **Digest with $E_A$**: This step is performed in Buffer $A$, which is optimal for $E_A$. This is valid.\n2.  **Add Buffer $B$ components, heat-inactivate $E_A$, add $E_B$**: This part of the protocol has two fatal flaws.\n    -   **Flaw 1 (Heat Inactivation):** The problem explicitly states that $E_A$ is **not reliably heat-inactivated**. Attempting to do so is improper procedure and will likely leave active $E_A$ in the reaction.\n    -   **Flaw 2 (Enzyme Inhibition):** After the first digestion in a $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ volume containing Buffer $A$ ($50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{NaCl}$), the protocol adds components for the second digest. The volume of the first reaction mixture is $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. Let's conservatively ignore the volume of added buffer and enzyme for a moment. The $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ solution contains a total of $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L} \\times 50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ of $\\mathrm{NaCl}$. When the second reaction is set up, this $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ remains. The concentration of $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ will be diluted slightly but will remain high. Let's calculate it accurately. The second reaction volume will be $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ (from step 1) + $5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ ($10\\times$ Buffer $B$) + $1.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ ($E_B$) = $56.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. The final concentration of $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ carried over from Buffer $A$ is: $[\\mathrm{NaCl}]_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{mM} \\times 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}}{56.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}} \\approx 44.4\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n    -   Since $E_B$ is strongly inhibited by $[\\mathrm{NaCl}] \\geq 30\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, and the final concentration would be approximately $44.4\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $E_B$ would be severely inhibited, leading to partial or no digestion.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The protocol relies on a non-functional heat inactivation step and creates buffer conditions that inhibit the second enzyme, $E_B$.\n\n**Option B Analysis:**\n1.  **Digest with $E_B$**: This step is performed in Buffer $B$ ($100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{KCl}$), which is optimal for $E_B$. This is valid.\n2.  **Heat-inactivate $E_B$**: The problem states $E_B$ can be fully heat-inactivated at $80^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ for $20\\,\\mathrm{min}$. This step is correct and effective.\n3.  **Add Buffer $A$ components and add $E_A$**: After heat inactivation, the reaction tube still contains all the components of Buffer $B$, most notably $100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{KCl}$. Let's calculate the final $\\mathrm{KCl}$ concentration. The new reaction volume is $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ (from step 1) + $5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ ($10\\times$ Buffer $A$) + $1.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ ($E_A$) = $56.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. The final concentration of $\\mathrm{KCl}$ carried over from Buffer $B$ is: $[\\mathrm{KCl}]_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{mM} \\times 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}}{56.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}} \\approx 88.9\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n    -   Enzyme $E_A$ is inhibited by $[\\mathrm{KCl}] \\geq 40\\,\\mathrm{mM}$. Since the final concentration would be approximately $88.9\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $E_A$ activity would be severely compromised.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**. Although the heat inactivation step is correct, the protocol fails to address the buffer incompatibility, leading to inhibition of the second enzyme, $E_A$.\n\n**Option C Analysis:**\n1.  **Digest with $E_B$**: Performed in Buffer $B$, this step is valid.\n2.  **Heat-inactivate $E_B$**: This step is valid and represents good practice, though it is technically redundant given the next step.\n3.  **Spin-column purification**: This is the crucial step. The problem states that purification removes enzymes, salts (to $< 1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ monovalent cations), and glycerol. This procedure effectively cleans the digested DNA from the inhibitory components of Buffer $B$ (i.e., $100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{KCl}$).\n4.  **Second digest with $E_A$**: The purified DNA is eluted into $45\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ of water. Then, $5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ of $10\\times$ Buffer $A$ is added. This reconstitutes the DNA in $1\\times$ Buffer $A$. The final buffer for the second digest is now Buffer $A$, containing $50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ and negligible $\\mathrm{KCl}$ ($< 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ after dilution), which is the optimal condition for $E_A$.\n    - The final volume would be $45\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L} + 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L} + 1.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L} = 51.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. The concentration of Buffer $A$ would be $5/51.25 \\approx 0.976\\times$, which is a negligible deviation.\n    - The final monovalent cation concentration is $\\approx 0.976 \\times 50\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 48.8\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, which is well above the $20\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ threshold for $E_A$ star activity.\n    - Glycerol from the second enzyme addition would be $(0.50 \\times 1.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}) / 51.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L} \\times 100\\% \\approx 1.22\\%$, which is well below the $5\\%$ limit.\nThis protocol correctly identifies and resolves the buffer incompatibility by using an intermediate purification step.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**. This is the only protocol that rigorously adheres to all specified constraints, ensuring both enzymes function under their optimal conditions, leading to a complete and specific double digest.\n\n**Option D Analysis:**\n1.  **Simultaneous double digest**: This approach attempts to use both enzymes at the same time in a single \"compromise\" buffer.\n2.  **Buffer Composition**: A common method for creating a compromise buffer is to aim for final salt concentrations that are an average of the two optimal buffers. Assuming the target is an average of the $1\\times$ buffer compositions, the final reaction would have $[\\mathrm{NaCl}] \\approx 25\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ and $[\\mathrm{KCl}] \\approx 50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n3.  **Enzyme Activity**:\n    - For $E_A$: The buffer contains $50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{KCl}$. Since $E_A$ is inhibited by $[\\mathrm{KCl}] \\geq 40\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, its activity will be significantly reduced, likely leading to incomplete digestion at the $E_A$ site.\n    - For $E_B$: The buffer contains $25\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{NaCl}$. This is below the inhibitory threshold of $30\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, so $E_B$ might retain reasonable activity.\n    - However, since a complete *double* digest is required, the failure of even one enzyme renders the protocol invalid.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**. A simultaneous digest is not feasible because a compromise buffer cannot be formulated that supports the activity of both enzymes; specifically, the KCl concentration required for $E_B$ is inhibitory to $E_A$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "5156288"}]}
