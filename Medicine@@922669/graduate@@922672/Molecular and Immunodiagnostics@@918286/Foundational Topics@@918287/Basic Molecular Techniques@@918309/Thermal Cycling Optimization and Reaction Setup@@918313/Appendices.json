Rate in the Presence of EDTA**\n\nIn the presence of EDTA, a portion of the total magnesium is sequestered in the $\\mathrm{MgEDTA}^{2-}$ complex. We must find the equilibrium concentration of free magnesium, $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free, with EDTA}}$.\n\nWe define the total analytical concentrations:\n- $C_{\\mathrm{Mg}} = [\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{total}} = 2.50\\ \\mathrm{mM} = 2.50 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n- $C_{\\mathrm{EDTA}} = [\\mathrm{EDTA}]_{\\mathrm{total}} = 0.80\\ \\mathrm{mM} = 0.80 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n\nThe equilibrium reaction is governed by the conditional formation constant, $K_{f}^{\\prime} = 6.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+} + \\mathrm{EDTA} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{MgEDTA}^{2-}\n$$\nThe mass balance equations are:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{Mg}} = [\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}} + [\\mathrm{MgEDTA}^{2-}]\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{EDTA}} = [\\mathrm{EDTA}]_{\\mathrm{free}} + [\\mathrm{MgEDTA}^{2-}]\n$$\nLet $x = [\\mathrm{MgEDTA}^{2-}]$ be the concentration of the complex at equilibrium. We can express the free concentrations in terms of $x$:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free}} = C_{\\mathrm{Mg}} - x\n$$\n$$\n[\\mathrm{EDTA}]_{\\mathrm{free}} = C_{\\mathrm{EDTA}} - x\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $K_{f}^{\\prime}$:\n$$\nK_{f}^{\\prime} = \\frac{x}{(C_{\\mathrm{Mg}} - x)(C_{\\mathrm{EDTA}} - x)}\n$$\nRearranging this gives a quadratic equation in $x$:\n$$\nK_{f}^{\\prime} (C_{\\mathrm{Mg}}C_{\\mathrm{EDTA}} - C_{\\mathrm{Mg}}x - C_{\\mathrm{EDTA}}x + x^2) = x\n$$\n$$\nK_{f}^{\\prime}x^2 - (K_{f}^{\\prime}(C_{\\mathrm{Mg}} + C_{\\mathrm{EDTA}}) + 1)x + K_{f}^{\\prime}C_{\\mathrm{Mg}}C_{\\mathrm{EDTA}} = 0\n$$\nWe substitute the numerical values in Molar units to solve for $x$:\n- $a = K_{f}^{\\prime} = 6.0 \\times 10^{6}$\n- $b = -[ (6.0 \\times 10^{6})(2.50 \\times 10^{-3} + 0.80 \\times 10^{-3}) + 1 ] = -[ (6.0 \\times 10^{6})(3.30 \\times 10^{-3}) + 1 ] = -[19800 + 1] = -19801$\n- $c = (6.0 \\times 10^{6})(2.50 \\times 10^{-3})(0.80 \\times 10^{-3}) = (6.0 \\times 10^{6})(2.0 \\times 10^{-6}) = 12$\n\nThe quadratic equation is $6.0 \\times 10^6 x^2 - 19801 x + 12 = 0$. We solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\nx = \\frac{19801 \\pm \\sqrt{(-19801)^2 - 4(6.0 \\times 10^6)(12)}}{2(6.0 \\times 10^6)}\n$$\n$$\nx = \\frac{19801 \\pm \\sqrt{392079601 - 288000000}}{1.2 \\times 10^7}\n$$\n$$\nx = \\frac{19801 \\pm \\sqrt{104079601}}{1.2 \\times 10^7} \\approx \\frac{19801 \\pm 10201.941}{1.2 \\times 10^7}\n$$\nThis yields two possible roots for $x$:\n$$\nx_1 \\approx \\frac{19801 + 10201.941}{1.2 \\times 10^7} \\approx 0.002500\\ \\mathrm{M}\n$$\n$$\nx_2 \\approx \\frac{19801 - 10201.941}{1.2 \\times 10^7} \\approx 0.00079992\\ \\mathrm{M}\n$$\nThe concentration of the complex, $x$, cannot exceed the initial concentration of the limiting reactant, which is EDTA at $C_{\\mathrm{EDTA}} = 0.80 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M}$. Thus, the first root $x_1$ is physically impossible. The correct solution is $x_2$.\n$$\nx = [\\mathrm{MgEDTA}^{2-}] \\approx 0.00079992\\ \\mathrm{M}\n$$\nThe equilibrium concentration of free magnesium is:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free, with EDTA}} = C_{\\mathrm{Mg}} - x = 2.50 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{M} - 0.00079992\\ \\mathrm{M} = 0.00170008\\ \\mathrm{M}\n$$\nConverting back to millimolar for consistency with $K_{m,\\mathrm{Mg}}$:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free, with EDTA}} = 1.70008\\ \\mathrm{mM}\n$$\nThe initial rate with EDTA is:\n$$\nv_{0, \\text{ with EDTA}} = V_{\\max} \\frac{[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free, with EDTA}}}{K_{m,\\mathrm{Mg}} + [\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{free, with EDTA}}}\n$$\n$$\nv_{0, \\text{ with EDTA}} = V_{\\max} \\frac{1.70008\\ \\mathrm{mM}}{0.50\\ \\mathrm{mM} + 1.70008\\ \\mathrm{mM}} = V_{\\max} \\frac{1.70008}{2.20008}\n$$\n\n**3.
