Provide the exact expression; no rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the expected fraction of amplifiable DNA templates, denoted $S(t)$, after exposure to UV-C irradiation for a duration $t$. The derivation must be based on first principles, specifically the definitions of a homogeneous Poisson process and first-order loss kinetics.\n\nLet us define the variables and the process formally. The fundamental event is the formation of a UV-induced lesion on a single DNA template. The problem states that these events occur according to a homogeneous Poisson point process with a constant rate $k$ per template per unit time. A template is rendered non-amplifiable if it acquires one or more lesions. At time $t=0$, the fraction of amplifiable templates is $1$, which we can write as $S(0) = 1$.\n\nWe can approach this derivation from two equivalent perspectives as requested: directly from the probability distribution of the Poisson process, and from the differential equation representing first-order kinetics.\n\n**Method 1: Derivation from the Poisson Process**\n\nA homogeneous Poisson process describes the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. Let $N(t)$ be the random variable representing the number of lesions on a single DNA template after an exposure time $t$. According to the problem statement, $N(t)$ follows a Poisson distribution. The rate parameter of this process for a time interval of length $t$ is the product of the rate $k$ and the duration $t$. Thus, the mean number of lesions per template is $\\mu = kt$.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for a Poisson-distributed random variable $N(t)$ with mean $\\mu = kt$ gives the probability of observing exactly $n$ lesions in the time interval $[0, t]$:\n$$P(N(t) = n) = \\frac{\\mu^n \\exp(-\\mu)}{n!} = \\frac{(kt)^n \\exp(-kt)}{n!}$$\nwhere $n$ is a non-negative integer ($n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$).\n\nA template remains amplifiable if and only if it has acquired zero lesions. Therefore, the probability that a single, randomly chosen template is still amplifiable after time $t$ is the probability that $N(t) = 0$. We can calculate this by substituting $n=0$ into the PMF:\n$$P(N(t) = 0) = \\frac{(kt)^0 \\exp(-kt)}{0!}$$\n\nBy definition, any non-zero number raised to the power of $0$ is $1$ (i.e., $(kt)^0 = 1$ for $t > 0$), and the factorial of $0$ is $1$ (i.e., $0! = 1$). This gives:\n$$P(N(t) = 0) = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\exp(-kt)}{1} = \\exp(-kt)$$\n\nThe expected fraction of amplifiable templates in a large population, $S(t)$, is equivalent to the probability that any individual template remains amplifiable. This is a consequence of the law of large numbers, as the lesion events are independent across templates.\nTherefore, we have:\n$$S(t) = P(N(t) = 0) = \\exp(-kt)$$\n\n**Method 2: Derivation from First-Order Loss Kinetics**\n\nFirst-order kinetics describes a process where the rate of change of a quantity is directly proportional to the amount of that quantity present. Let $S(t)$ be the fraction of amplifiable templates at time $t$. We wish to find the rate of change, $\\frac{dS(t)}{dt}$.\n\nConsider a small time interval $dt$ between $t$ and $t+dt$. The assumption of a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $k$ implies that the probability of a single lesion occurring on an amplifiable template during this infinitesimal interval $dt$ is $k \\cdot dt$. The probability of more than one lesion occurring in this interval is of a higher order, $o(dt)$, and can be neglected.\n\nThe decrease in the fraction of amplifiable templates, $S(t) - S(t+dt)$, is due to the templates that were amplifiable at time $t$ acquiring a lesion during the interval $dt$. The fraction of such templates is the product of the fraction that was amplifiable at time $t$, which is $S(t)$, and the probability of an event occurring in $dt$, which is $k \\cdot dt$.\nThus, we can write:\n$$S(t) - S(t+dt) = S(t) \\cdot (k \\cdot dt)$$\n\nRearranging this expression, we get:\n$$\\frac{S(t+dt) - S(t)}{dt} = -k S(t)$$\n\nTaking the limit as $dt \\to 0$ gives the definition of the derivative:\n$$\\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = \\lim_{dt \\to 0} \\frac{S(t+dt) - S(t)}{dt} = -k S(t)$$\n\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve this equation by separation of variables, subject to the initial condition $S(0)=1$.\n$$\\frac{dS}{S} = -k \\cdot dt$$\n\nIntegrating both sides from the initial state ($t=0$, $S=1$) to a general state ($t$, $S(t)$):\n$$\\int_{S=1}^{S(t)} \\frac{1}{S'} dS' = \\int_{t'=0}^{t} -k \\cdot dt'$$\n\nEvaluating the integrals gives:\n$$[\\ln(S')]_{1}^{S(t)} = [-k t']_{0}^{t}$$\n$$\\ln(S(t)) - \\ln(1) = (-kt) - (-k \\cdot 0)$$\nSince $\\ln(1) = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\ln(S(t)) = -kt$$\n\nTo find $S(t)$, we exponentiate both sides of the equation:\n$$S(t) = \\exp(-kt)$$\n\nBoth derivations, one based on the probabilistic foundation of the Poisson process and the other on the resultant macroscopic first-order kinetics, yield the identical closed-form expression for the expected fraction of amplifiable templates. The expression $S(t) = \\exp(-kt)$ describes the exponential decay of the amplifiable template population under constant UV-C exposure, which is a fundamental model in photobiology and inactivation studies.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp(-kt)}$$", "id": "5146203"}, {"introduction": "Even with the best prevention, low-level background contamination can persist, creating a challenge for high-sensitivity assays.

The fundamental facts for analysis are as follows: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) exponentially amplifies starting template molecules, so after $c$ cycles the amplicon count is $N(c) = N_0 (1+E)^{c}$, where $N_0$ denotes the number of amplifiable template molecules that seeded the reaction and $E$ is the per-cycle efficiency.

Hence $C_{q}$ is a strictly decreasing function of $N_0$, making $N_0$ a sufficient statistic for discriminating hypotheses that differ only in the expected seeding count. Near the limit of detection, $N_0$ is dominated by stochastic sampling of molecules into the reaction volume and is well modeled by a Poisson random variable due to random partitioning in a well-mixed solution.\n\nConsider two hypotheses about the origin of $N_0$ in a single reaction:\n- $H_{c}$ (contamination-only): $N_0 \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_{c})$, representing aerosol or carryover contamination with mean $\\lambda_{c} > 0$ molecules per reaction.\n- $H_{t}$ (true low-titer positive): $N_0 \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_{t})$, representing a genuine low-titer sample with mean $\\lambda_{t} > \\lambda_{c}$ molecules per reaction.\n\nAssume $N_0$ is directly inferable as the sufficient statistic from the measured $C_{q}$ via the monotonic mapping above and that measurement noise is negligible relative to the Poisson seeding noise at this operating regime.
