Since the natural logarithm function, $\\ln(x)$, is monotonically increasing, the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{k\\delta}{RT}\\right)\\right) \\leq \\ln(r^{*}) $$\n$$ -\\frac{k\\delta}{RT} \\leq \\ln(r^{*}) $$\nNext, we multiply the inequality by $-1$, which reverses its direction:\n$$ \\frac{k\\delta}{RT} \\geq -\\ln(r^{*}) $$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $-\\ln(x) = \\ln(1/x)$, we obtain:\n$$ \\frac{k\\delta}{RT} \\geq \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{r^{*}}\\right) $$\nFinally, isolating $k$ gives the lower bound from the thermodynamic criterion:\n$$ k \\geq \\frac{RT}{\\delta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{r^{*}}\\right) $$\n\nThe second constraint concerns the mechanism of DNA polymerase extension. It is stated that extension requires at least $s$ contiguous correctly paired bases at the $3'$ terminus, and if the number of mismatches $k$ is greater than or equal to $s$, extension is disfavored. The problem requires us to satisfy the condition $k \\geq s$.\n$$ k \\geq s $$\n\nTo ensure both criteria are met, $k$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum of the two derived lower bounds:\n$$ k \\geq \\max\\left( \\frac{RT}{\\delta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{r^{*}}\\right), s \\right) $$\nWe are given the following values:\n$T = 333 \\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$R = 0.001987 \\ \\mathrm{kcal} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n$\\delta = 3.5 \\ \\mathrm{kcal} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n$r^{*} = 10^{-5}$\n$s = 2$\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerical value for the thermodynamic lower bound:\n$$ k \\geq \\frac{(0.001987 \\ \\mathrm{kcal} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) (333 \\ \\mathrm{K})}{3.5 \\ \\mathrm{kcal} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{10^{-5}}\\right) $$\n$$ k \\geq \\frac{0.661671}{3.5} \\ln(10^5) $$\n$$ k \\geq 0.1890488 \\times 5 \\ln(10) $$\nUsing the value $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$:\n$$ k \\geq 0.1890488 \\times 5 \\times 2.302585 $$\n$$ k \\geq 0.1890488 \\times 11.512925 $$\n$$ k \\geq 2.17645 $$\nThe second constraint is $k \\geq s$, which with the given value is $k \\geq 2$.\n\nCombining the two constraints, we must satisfy $k \\geq \\max(2.17645, 2)$, which simplifies to $k \\geq 2.17645$.\nSince $k$ represents a number of nucleotides, it must be an integer. The minimal integer value of $k$ that satisfies this inequality is the smallest integer greater than or equal to $2.17645$.\n$$ k_{\\min} = \\lceil 2.17645 \\rceil = 3 $$\nTherefore, a minimum of $3$ nucleotides must be designed to cross the splice junction and be mismatched against the genomic DNA template.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "5149563"}]}
