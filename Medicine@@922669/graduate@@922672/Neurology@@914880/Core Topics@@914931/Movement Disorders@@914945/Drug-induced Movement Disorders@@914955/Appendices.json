It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical kinetics and pharmacology, is mathematically well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution without any internal contradictions.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the receptor occupancy equation for a single ligand–single receptor system at equilibrium, followed by a numerical calculation. We begin from the fundamental principles as stipulated.\n\nThe reversible binding reaction is given by:\n$$D + R \\rightleftharpoons DR$$\nwhere $D$ represents the free drug (ligand), $R$ represents the free receptor, and $DR$ represents the drug-receptor complex.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, at thermodynamic equilibrium, the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the reactants to the concentration of the product complex is a constant. This constant is the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$.\n$$K_d = \\frac{[D][R]}{[DR]}$$\nHere, $[D]$, $[R]$, and $[DR]$ are the molar concentrations of the free drug, free receptor, and drug-receptor complex at equilibrium, respectively.\n\nThe problem states that the free drug concentration in the biophase, $[D]$, is equal to the measured concentration $C$. So, we can write:\n$$[D] = C$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{C[R]}{[DR]}$$\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, denoted as $[R_{\\text{total}}]$, is conserved. This means it is the sum of the free receptors and the receptors bound to the drug:\n$$[R_{\\text{total}}] = [R] + [DR]$$\n\nReceptor occupancy, $O$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are bound by the drug at equilibrium. Mathematically, this is:\n$$O = \\frac{[DR]}{[R_{\\text{total}}]}$$\n\nOur goal is to express $O$ as a function of only $C$ and $K_d$. To achieve this, we must eliminate $[R]$, $[DR]$, and $[R_{\\text{total}}]$ from the equations by substitution.\n\nFirst, we rearrange the equilibrium equation to solve for the free receptor concentration $[R]$:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_d [DR]}{C}$$\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for the total receptor concentration:\n$$[R_{\\text{total}}] = \\left( \\frac{K_d [DR]}{C} \\right) + [DR]$$\n\nWe can factor out $[DR]$ from the right-hand side of the equation:\n$$[R_{\\text{total}}] = [DR] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{C} + 1 \\right)$$\n\nNow, we can rearrange this equation to find the ratio $\\frac{[DR]}{[R_{\\text{total}}]}$, which is the definition of occupancy, $O$:\n$$O = \\frac{[DR]}{[R_{\\text{total}}]} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{C} + 1}$$\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can combine the terms in the denominator by finding a common denominator:\n$$O = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d + C}{C}}$$\n\nFinally, inverting the denominator gives the desired expression for receptor occupancy, known as the Hill-Langmuir equation for non-cooperative binding:\n$$O = \\frac{C}{C + K_d}$$\n\nThis completes the derivation. Now, we use this expression to compute the occupancy for the given values:\n- Drug concentration $C = 3 \\text{ nM}$\n- Dissociation constant $K_d = 2 \\text{ nM}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the occupancy equation:\n$$O = \\frac{3 \\text{ nM}}{3 \\text{ nM} + 2 \\text{ nM}}$$\n\nThe units of concentration (nM) in the numerator and denominator cancel out, yielding a dimensionless quantity for occupancy, as expected.\n$$O = \\frac{3}{3 + 2} = \\frac{3}{5}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer as a unitless decimal fraction.

Drug-induced akathisia is a movement disorder characterized by a subjective sense of inner restlessness and an objective pattern of motor activity, often involving the legs. The Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) quantifies three subscales: objective motor signs, subjective awareness of restlessness, and subjective distress, each scored ordinally. For the purposes of this problem, define the composite BARS subscale total as the sum of these three subscales and denote this total by $T$. You will compute $T$ from descriptive interview data and quantitative ankle-wrist accelerometry during standardized observation.\n\nObservation protocol and operational definitions:\n- The patient underwent a two-phase standardized observation: a seated phase of duration $10$ minutes and a standing/walking-allowed phase of duration $10$ minutes. Accelerometers were placed at the dominant wrist and ankle. Movement bursts are defined by thresholded acceleration envelopes; each burst contributes its duration to the movement time. Let $p$ denote the seated duty fraction, defined as $p = \\frac{\\text{total seated movement time}}{\\text{total seated observation time}}$.

This task requires a meta-analysis of the trial results to obtain a pooled estimate of the treatment effect, which is then combined with the given placebo effect.\n\nFirst, we formalize the problem by defining the variables and stating the given information.
