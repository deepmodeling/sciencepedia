By convention, outward current is positive. The total current flowing across the membrane is the sum of the capacitive current, the leak current ($I_L$), the excitatory mossy fiber current ($I_M$), and the inhibitory Purkinje cell current ($I_P$). The sum of all currents flowing out of the neuron must be zero, which is a statement of Kirchhoff's current law or charge conservation.\n$$\nI_C + I_L + I_{syn} = 0\n$$\nwhere $I_{syn}$ is the net synaptic current.\n\nThe problem provides the following constitutive relations and definitions:\n1.  The leak current, $I_L$, follows Ohm's law. It is an outward ionic current given by $I_L = g_L(V - E_L)$, where $g_L$ is the leak conductance and $E_L$ is the leak reversal potential.\n2.  The mossy fiber current, $I_M$, is an excitatory input. By convention, excitatory currents are inward (depolarizing). We define the inward current as negative, so the contribution to the total outward current is $-I_M$.\n3.  The Purkinje cell current, $I_P$, is an inhibitory input. By convention, inhibitory currents are outward (hyperpolarizing). We define the outward current as positive, so its contribution to the total outward current is $+I_P$.\n\nSubstituting these components into the charge conservation equation:\n$$\nC\\frac{dV}{dt} + g_L(V - E_L) - I_M + I_P = 0\n$$\nRearranging this equation to match the form given in the problem statement confirms its physical basis:\n$$\nC\\frac{dV}{dt} = -g_L(V - E_L) + I_M - I_P\n$$\nThis is the differential equation governing the membrane potential $V(t)$.\n\nThe steady-state membrane potential, $V_{\\infty}$, is the value of $V$ reached as time $t$ approaches infinity ($t \\to \\infty$).
