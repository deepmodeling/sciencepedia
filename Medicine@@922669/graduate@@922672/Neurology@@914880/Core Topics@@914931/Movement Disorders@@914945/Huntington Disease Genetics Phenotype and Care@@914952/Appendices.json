A field-standard scalar index to summarize this joint effect in the premanifest phase is the CAG–Age Product (CAP), which is defined by multiplying chronological age by the excess CAG repeat count above a centering constant chosen to approximate the population mean repeat length in unaffected individuals. For the canonical implementation used in longitudinal observational cohorts, the centering constant is $33.66$, so the CAP index rises linearly with both age and the degree to which the repeat count exceeds $33.66$. Established premanifest risk-group thresholds for this canonical CAP are: “low” if CAP $< 290$, “medium” if $290 \\leq \\text{CAP} \\leq 368$, and “high” if CAP $> 368$.\n\nAn individual is gene-expanded with CAG repeat count $CAG = 42$ and current age $age = 32$ years.\n\nUsing only the definition above and these thresholds, compute the CAP value for this individual and determine the corresponding premanifest risk category.
