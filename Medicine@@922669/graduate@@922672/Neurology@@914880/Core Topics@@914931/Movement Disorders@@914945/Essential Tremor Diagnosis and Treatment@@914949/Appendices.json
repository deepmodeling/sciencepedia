It is a standard, well-defined problem in applied probability theory (specifically, Bayesian inference in a diagnostic context).\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet us define the following events:\n-   $H$: The event that the patient has hyperthyroidism.\n-   $H^c$: The event that the patient does not have hyperthyroidism (the complement of $H$).\n-   $T^+$: The event that the TSH test result is positive (TSH $< 0.1$ mIU/L).\n-   $T^-$: The event that the TSH test result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1.  The pretest probability of hyperthyroidism is the prior probability of event $H$:\n    $$P(H) = 0.05$$\n2.  The sensitivity of the test is the conditional probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present:\n    $$P(T^+ \\mid H) = 0.95$$\n3.  The specificity of the test is the conditional probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent:\n    $$P(T^- \\mid H^c) = 0.90$$\n\nOur objective is to compute the post-test probability of hyperthyroidism given a positive test result, which is the conditional probability $P(H \\mid T^+)$.\n\nFollowing the constraint to use only fundamental definitions, we begin with the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(H \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(H \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\nwhere $P(H \\cap T^+)$ is the joint probability of having hyperthyroidism and testing positive.\n\nThe numerator, $P(H \\cap T^+)$, can be re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\mid B) = P(A \\cap B) / P(B)$, rearranged as $P(A \\cap B) = P(A \\mid B) P(B)$:\n$$P(H \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid H) P(H)$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. We can calculate this using the law of total probability. The event $T^+$ can be partitioned into two mutually exclusive events: testing positive with hyperthyroidism ($T^+ \\cap H$) and testing positive without hyperthyroidism ($T^+ \\cap H^c$).\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap H) + P(T^+ \\cap H^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term in the sum:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid H) P(H) + P(T^+ \\mid H^c) P(H^c)$$\n\nTo evaluate this expression, we need the probabilities $P(H^c)$ and $P(T^+ \\mid H^c)$.\nThe probability of not having hyperthyroidism, $P(H^c)$, is the complement of having it:\n$$P(H^c) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$$\nThe probability $P(T^+ \\mid H^c)$ is the probability of a positive test in a patient without the disease (the false positive rate). This is the complement of the specificity, $P(T^- \\mid H^c)$:\n$$P(T^+ \\mid H^c) = 1 - P(T^- \\mid H^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\n\nNow we can substitute all the known and derived values back into the expressions for the numerator and denominator of $P(H \\mid T^+)$.\nNumerator:\n$$P(H \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid H) P(H) = (0.95) \\times (0.05) = 0.0475$$\nDenominator:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid H) P(H) + P(T^+ \\mid H^c) P(H^c)$$\n$$P(T^+) = (0.95) \\times (0.05) + (0.10) \\times (0.95)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.0475 + 0.0950 = 0.1425$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the desired post-test probability:\n$$P(H \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(H \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{0.0475}{0.1425}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$P(H \\mid T^+) = 0.333333...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(H \\mid T^+) \\approx 0.3333$$\nThis result, known as the positive predictive value (PPV) in this context, indicates that even with a positive test, there is only a $33.33\\%$ chance the patient has hyperthyroidism, a significant increase from the pretest probability of $5\\%$ but still less than $50\\%$.

Essential tremor is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by kinetic and postural tremor with functional impairment. The TETRAS Performance subscale yields an additive severity score that increases with tremor amplitude and task interference, and is widely used to quantify tremor severity in clinical trials.

It requires the design of a measurement protocol, the definition of a specific clinical metric, and the calculation of a standardized effect size from provided summary statistics. The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information.\n\nThe complete response is structured in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part I: Design of a Rigorous Measurement Protocol**\n\nA scientifically rigorous protocol for measuring the acute treatment response to Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in patients with Essential Tremor using The Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS) is formulated as follows. This protocol emphasizes standardization, objectivity, and the minimization of bias.\n\n1.  **Subject and Setting Prerequisites:**\n    -   Subjects must have a confirmed diagnosis of essential tremor and be undergoing treatment with a DBS system implanted to target the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) of the thalamus.\n    -   Assessments must be conducted in a controlled, quiet environment to minimize distractions.\n    -   All raters must be formally trained and certified in the administration and scoring of the TETRAS to ensure inter-rater reliability. A detailed Manual of Procedures (MOP) must be used.\n\n2.  **Timing and Blinding Protocol:**\n    -   **Washout Period:** Prior to the pre-stimulation assessment, the subject's DBS device must be turned off for a specified washout period. A minimum duration of $12$ hours (e.g., overnight) is required to ensure that the tremor returns to a stable, un-stimulated baseline, free of any lingering therapeutic effects.\n    -   **Pre-Stimulation (DBS Off) Assessment:** After the washout period, the 'DBS Off' assessment is performed.\n    -   **Stimulation and Stabilization:** Immediately following the 'DBS Off' assessment, an unblinded clinician or programmer turns the DBS device on to the subject's previously determined, clinically optimal stimulation parameters. A stabilization interval of at least $30$ minutes must pass before the next assessment to allow the therapeutic effect of the stimulation to reach a steady state.\n    -   **Post-Stimulation (DBS On) Assessment:** After the stabilization interval, the 'DBS On' assessment is performed.\n    -   **Rater Blinding:** The rater administering the TETRAS must be blinded to the stimulation condition (DBS On or Off). This is achieved by having a separate, unblinded individual control the DBS device. The rater should have no communication regarding the device status. Blinding is a critical control for rater-introduced bias.\n\n3.  **Data Acquisition and Aggregation:**\n    -   **TETRAS Performance Subscale:** The assessment will exclusively use the TETRAS Performance subscale (Part $4$ of the scale), which consists of $9$ tasks (items $15-23$).\n    -   **Scoring:** Each of the $9$ items is scored on an ordinal scale from $0$ (no tremor) to $4$ (severe tremor).\n    -   **Composite Score:** A single composite performance score is generated for each condition by summing the scores of the $9$ individual items. The total score, denoted as $S$, can range from $0$ (no tremor) to $36$ (most severe tremor). We thus obtain a pre-stimulation score, $S_{pre}$, and a post-stimulation score, $S_{post}$.\n    -   **Video Capture:** All assessment tasks for both conditions must be video-recorded using a standardized camera position and setup. These recordings provide a permanent archival record for quality control, verification, and potential re-scoring by independent blinded raters.\n\n4.  **Exclusion Criteria:**\n    -   A subject's data set (both pre- and post-stimulation scores) will be considered unusable and excluded from the final analysis if there is: a significant protocol deviation (e.g., failure of blinding, incorrect washout/stabilization timing); a technical failure with the DBS device or recording equipment; or if the subject is unable to complete the required tasks for reasons unrelated to tremor.\n\n**Part II: Definition of the Tremor Reduction Quantity**\n\nThe problem asks for a unitless proportion for tremor reduction derived from the definition of percentage change.\n\n-   Let $S_{pre}$ be the composite TETRAS score in the pre-stimulation (DBS Off) condition, representing the initial tremor severity.\n-   Let $S_{post}$ be the composite TETRAS score in the post-stimulation (DBS On) condition.\n-   The change in score is the final score minus the initial score: $\\Delta S = S_{post} - S_{pre}$.\n-   The \"percentage change as a change relative to the initial quantity,\" expressed as a unitless decimal fraction, is defined as the proportional change, $P_c$. This quantity is calculated as:\n    $$P_c = \\frac{\\Delta S}{S_{pre}} = \\frac{S_{post} - S_{pre}}{S_{pre}}$$\n-   This value is negative for an improvement (i.e., a reduction in tremor score) and is undefined if $S_{pre} = 0$. In practice, patients with $S_{pre} = 0$ would be excluded as there is no tremor to treat. This quantity directly formalizes the requested definition.\n\n**Part III: Justification and Calculation of the Standardized Effect Size**\n\n1.  **Justification of the Effect Size Metric:**\n    The study employs a paired pre-post design, where each subject acts as their own control. For each subject $i$, a pair of measurements $(S_{pre, i}, S_{post, i})$ is obtained. The effect of the intervention is captured by the set of individual difference scores, $D_i = S_{post, i} - S_{pre, i}$. The core of the statistical analysis is to determine if the mean of these difference scores is significantly different from zero.\n\n    A standardized effect size is essential for quantifying the magnitude of the observed effect in a way that is independent of the measurement scale (in this case, the TETRAS point scale). For a paired-samples design, the appropriate standardization must account for the correlated nature of the pre- and post-test data. The correct approach, derived from first principles, is to standardize the mean difference by the standard deviation of the differences. This is because the variability of the change scores, $s_D$, is the relevant measure of dispersion for the effect. This effect size, sometimes denoted $d_z$, is defined as the mean difference score divided by the standard deviation of the difference scores. It represents the magnitude of the average change in units of standard deviation of that change.\n\n    The formula is:\n    $$d = \\frac{\\bar{D}}{s_D}$$\n    where $\\bar{D}$ is the mean of the difference scores ($D_i$) and $s_D$ is the standard deviation of these difference scores.\n\n2.  **Calculation of the Effect Size ($d$):**\n    The problem provides the following summary statistics from a cohort studied under this protocol:\n    -   Mean pre–post change ($\\bar{D}$): The mean of ($S_{post} - S_{pre}$) is given as $-8$ points. So, $\\bar{D} = -8$.\n    -   Standard deviation of the paired changes ($s_D$): The standard deviation of the difference scores ($D_i$) is given as $10$ points. So, $s_D = 10$.\n\n    Substituting these values into the justified formula for the paired-samples standardized effect size:\n    $$d = \\frac{-8}{10}$$\n    $$d = -0.8$$\n    The calculated effect size is $-0.8$. The negative sign reflects that the post-stimulation scores were, on average, lower than the pre-stimulation scores, indicating a reduction in tremor severity consistent with a therapeutic effect. The magnitude, $|d| = 0.8$, represents a large effect by conventional standards.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.8}$$", "id": "4478704"}]}
