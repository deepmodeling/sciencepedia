The validation of the problem statement confirms its scientific soundness, consistency, and well-posed nature. We will proceed with a step-by-step solution based on first principles of membrane biophysics.\n\nThe membrane is modeled as a passive parallel circuit consisting of a chloride conductance $g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$, a potassium leak conductance $g_{\\mathrm{K}}$, and a specific membrane capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{m}}$. The dynamics of the membrane potential, $V$, are described by the equation:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{m}} \\frac{dV}{dt} + I_{\\text{ion}}(V) = 0$$\nwhere $I_{\\text{ion}}(V)$ is the total ionic current density flowing across the membrane. In the passive state, this current is the sum of the chloride and potassium currents:\n$$I_{\\text{ion}}(V) = I_{\\mathrm{Cl}}(V) + I_{\\mathrm{K}}(V)$$\nAssuming ohmic behavior near the resting potential, these currents are given by:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{Cl}}(V) = g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}(V - E_{\\mathrm{Cl}})$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{K}}(V) = g_{\\mathrm{K}}(V - E_{\\mathrm{K}})$$\nwhere $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ are the respective Nernst potentials.\n\nThe total passive membrane conductance per unit area, $g_{\\mathrm{m}}$, is the sum of the individual conductances:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{m}} = g_{\\mathrm{Cl}} + g_{\\mathrm{K}}$$\nFor small deviations from the resting potential, the membrane equation can be linearized. This reveals that the membrane potential returns to rest following a perturbation with a characteristic time constant, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}$, defined as:\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{m}}}{g_{\\mathrm{m}}}$$\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the new membrane time constant, $\\tau_{\\text{new}}$**\n\nFirst, we must determine the new total membrane conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{m,new}}$, after the pathological change. The baseline values are given as $g_{\\mathrm{Cl},0} = 1.6~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$ and $g_{\\mathrm{K},0} = 0.2~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$.\n\nThe problem states a $60\\%$ reduction in the ClC-1 current density, which is assumed to translate directly to a $60\\%$ reduction in the chloride conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$. The new chloride conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{Cl,new}}$, is therefore $40\\%$ of its baseline value:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{Cl,new}} = (1 - 0.60) \\times g_{\\mathrm{Cl},0} = 0.40 \\times 1.6~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2} = 0.64~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$$\nThe potassium leak conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{K}}$, remains unchanged, so $g_{\\mathrm{K,new}} = g_{\\mathrm{K},0} = 0.2~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$.\n\nThe new total membrane conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{m,new}}$, is the sum of the new component conductances:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{m,new}} = g_{\\mathrm{Cl,new}} + g_{\\mathrm{K,new}} = 0.64~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2} + 0.2~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2} = 0.84~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the new membrane time constant, $\\tau_{\\text{new}}$, using the given specific membrane capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{m}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{F/cm^2}$.\n$$\\tau_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{m}}}{g_{\\mathrm{m,new}}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values and ensuring consistent units (where $1~\\mathrm{mS} = 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{S}$ and $1~\\mathrm{F} = 1~\\mathrm{S \\cdot s}$):\n$$\\tau_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{F/cm^2}}{0.84~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{S \\cdot s/cm^2}}{0.84 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{S/cm^2}}$$\n$$\\tau_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1.0}{0.84} \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{s} \\approx 1.190476... \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem requests the answer in milliseconds ($1~\\mathrm{s} = 1000~\\mathrm{ms}$):\n$$\\tau_{\\text{new}} \\approx 1.190476...~\\mathrm{ms}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{new}} = 1.19~\\mathrm{ms}$$\nThis prolongation of the time constant (the baseline time constant would be $\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.8 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 0.56~\\mathrm{ms}$) is a direct consequence of the reduced membrane conductance.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the threshold inward conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{p,th,new}}$**\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the threshold value of a persistent inward conductance that would destabilize the resting potential, leading to repetitive firing (myotonia). This is a question of linear stability analysis.\n\nThe total ionic current now includes the persistent inward \"window\" current, $I_{\\mathrm{p}}(V)$:\n$$I_{\\text{ion,total}}(V) = I_{\\mathrm{Cl}}(V) + I_{\\mathrm{K}}(V) + I_{\\mathrm{p}}(V)$$\nThe stability of the resting fixed point is determined by the total slope conductance of the membrane at rest, $G'_{\\text{total}}$. The system is stable if this slope conductance is positive (producing a net outward current in response to a small depolarization) and becomes unstable at the point where it becomes zero.\n$$G'_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{dI_{\\text{ion,total}}}{dV}\\bigg|_{V=V_{\\text{rest}}}$$\nDifferentiating the total current with respect to voltage gives:\n$$G'_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{dI_{\\mathrm{Cl}}}{dV} + \\frac{dI_{\\mathrm{K}}}{dV} + \\frac{dI_{\\mathrm{p}}}{dV} = g_{\\mathrm{Cl,new}} + g_{\\mathrm{K,new}} + \\frac{dI_{\\mathrm{p}}}{dV}\\bigg|_{V=V_{\\text{rest}}}$$\nThe sum $g_{\\mathrm{Cl,new}} + g_{\\mathrm{K,new}} = g_{\\mathrm{m,new}}$ is the stabilizing outward leak slope conductance. The term $\\frac{dI_{\\mathrm{p}}}{dV}$ is the slope conductance of the inward current. In the \"window\" region, this current exhibits negative differential resistance, meaning its slope $\\frac{dI_{\\mathrm{p}}}{dV}$ is negative, representing a destabilizing influence.\n\nThe problem defines $g_{\\mathrm{p}}$ as the \"inward slope conductance\". This is best interpreted as the magnitude of the negative slope of the inward current, i.e., $g_{\\mathrm{p}} = -\\frac{dI_{\\mathrm{p}}}{dV}\\big|_{V=V_{\\text{rest}}}$. With this definition, the total slope conductance is:\n$$G'_{\\text{total}} = g_{\\mathrm{m,new}} - g_{\\mathrm{p}}$$\nThe threshold for instability (the bifurcation point) occurs when the total slope conductance is zero:\n$$G'_{\\text{total}} = 0 \\implies g_{\\mathrm{m,new}} - g_{\\mathrm{p}} = 0$$\nTherefore, the threshold value of the inward slope conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{p,th,new}}$, required for destabilization must exactly balance the total outward leak slope conductance:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{p,th,new}} = g_{\\mathrm{m,new}}$$\nUsing the value for $g_{\\mathrm{m,new}}$ calculated in Part 1:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{p,th,new}} = 0.84~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we express this as:\n$$g_{\\mathrm{p,th,new}} = 0.840~\\mathrm{mS/cm^2}$$\nThis result signifies that myotonia is precipitated when an additional inward (destabilizing) conductance slope becomes equal in magnitude to the remaining outward (stabilizing) leak conductance slope. The reduction in the dominant chloride conductance in myotonic dystrophy lowers this threshold, making the muscle fiber more susceptible to hyperexcitability.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.19 & 0.840\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4500676"}, {"introduction": "After understanding the physiological consequence, we turn to identifying the underlying genetic cause.

The laboratory currently uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. The team must decide between a conventional flanking PCR design (two primers in unique sequences on either side of the repeat, attempting to amplify across the entire repeat) and a tetraplet-primed polymerase chain reaction (TP-PCR; also called repeat-primed PCR) design, in which a primer with a $3'$ CCTG-anchoring sequence and a $5'$ non-complementary tail, paired with a single flanking primer, seeds amplification at many positions within the repeat to produce a characteristic ladder.\n\nUse the following foundational principles to reason about assay performance:\n\n- The Central Dogma and genomic architecture: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence features, including STRs, can form secondary structures depending on base composition; guanine-cytosine (GC) pairings increase stability of hairpins and slipped-strand structures.\n- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR): extension proceeds from bound primers through the intervening template; success depends on primer binding specificity, polymerase processivity, and the absence of persistent secondary structures that block extension. Under typical conditions, standard Taq-like polymerases robustly amplify up to approximately $1{,}000$–$3{,}000$ base pairs, and specialized long-range polymerases may reach approximately $10{,}000$–$20{,}000$ base pairs in non-repetitive templates; tandem repeats with high GC content and propensity for secondary structure reduce effective processivity.\n- Short tandem repeat (STR) arithmetic: if the CCTG array has $N$ repeat units, each of length $4$ nucleotides, the repeat region length is $$\\ell = 4N \\text{ bp}.$$ In DM2, $N$ can range from approximately $75$ to $>11{,}000$, implying $\\ell$ from approximately $300$ bp to $>44{,}000$ bp. Somatic mosaicism produces a distribution of lengths within a single individual.\n- Primer design constraints at the DM2 locus: the normal upstream motif architecture is $(\\text{TG})_n(\\text{TCTG})_n(\\text{CCTG})_n$, making the immediate flanking region polymorphic and prone to slippage and mis-annealing; expanded alleles are predominantly pure CCTG arrays, often with extreme length and somatic heterogeneity.\n\nQuestion: Select all statements that correctly explain why DM2 CCTG expansions are best detected with tetraplet-primed PCR and why conventional flanking PCR often fails at this locus.\n\nA. DM2 expansions frequently exceed the effective amplicon length that conventional flanking PCR can traverse and, with approximately $75\\%$ GC content in the CCTG motif, form stable secondary structures that stall polymerases; TP-PCR uses a repeat-anchored primer with a $5'$ tail to generate a diagnostic ladder in $4$-bp increments without requiring amplification across the entire expansion.\n\nB.

This generates a characteristic ladder of products.\n- **Molecular Principles of the Locus and Assay:**\n    - **Secondary Structure:** The CCTG repeat, with its high guanine-cytosine (GC) content, can form stable secondary structures (e.g., hairpins) that interfere with PCR.\n    - **PCR Limitations:** Standard polymerases amplify up to approximately $1,000–3,000$ base pairs (bp). Specialized long-range polymerases can reach approximately $10,000–20,000$ bp on ideal templates. Processivity is reduced by tandem repeats, high GC content, and secondary structures.\n    - **Allele Size:** The number of CCTG repeats, $N$, ranges from approximately $75$ to over $11,000$. The corresponding length of the repeat region, $\\ell = 4N$, ranges from approximately $300$ bp to over $44,000$ bp.\n    - **Somatic Mosaicism:** A single individual possesses a distribution of different repeat lengths in their cells.\n    - **Flanking Region Complexity:** The region upstream of the CCTG array has a polymorphic $(\\text{TG})_n(\\text{TCTG})_n$ structure, which can cause primer mis-annealing and slippage.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is assessed for validity:\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The description of DM2, the CCTG repeat in the *CNBP* gene, the size of pathogenic expansions, and the principles of PCR and STR analysis are all consistent with established knowledge in molecular genetics and diagnostics. The GC content of a CCTG repeat is $(1\\text{G} + 2\\text{C})/4 = 3/4 = 75\\%$, which is correctly identified as high and prone to forming stable secondary structures. The specified limitations of PCR polymerases are realistic.\n- **Well-Posed:** The question asks for an explanation of the performance differences between two specific analytical techniques based on a given set of principles. The provided information is sufficient to construct a rigorous answer.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and devoid of subjective claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. It provides the key data points needed for the analysis, such as the maximum expansion size ($>44,000$ bp) and the maximum amplification length of long-range PCR ($<20,000$ bp), creating a clear, non-contradictory basis for explaining conventional PCR failure.\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem does not contain any of the listed invalidating flaws such as being unrealistic, ill-posed, or trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The analysis can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe task is to identify the correct explanations for the failure of conventional flanking PCR and the success of TP-PCR in detecting large DM2 CCTG expansions. The analysis will be based strictly on the provided principles.\n\n**Analysis of Conventional Flanking PCR Failure:**\n1.  **Extreme Length:** The problem states that DM2 expansions can exceed $11,000$ repeats, corresponding to a length $\\ell > 4 \\times 11,000 = 44,000$ bp. It also states that even specialized long-range PCR struggles to amplify beyond $10,000–20,000$ bp. Therefore, amplifying a full-length pathogenic allele is physically impossible with conventional PCR techniques. The polymerase will dissociate from the template long before reaching the other side.\n2.  **Secondary Structures:** The repeat motif is CCTG, which has a $75\\%$ GC content. The principles state that high GC content promotes stable secondary structures like hairpins. Such structures act as physical blocks to the DNA polymerase, causing it to stall and terminate extension, even on templates that are theoretically within the length limit of the enzyme.\n3.  **Primer Binding Issues:** The flanking region is noted to be a polymorphic $(\\text{TG})_n(\\text{TCTG})_n$ complex repeat, which is \"prone to slippage and mis-annealing.\" A flanking primer placed in or near this region may fail to bind efficiently or specifically, compromising the reaction.\n4.  **Allelic Dropout:** Due to somatic mosaicism, a patient has a smear of different allele sizes. During PCR, shorter templates are amplified more efficiently than longer ones. When a normal, short allele is co-amplified with a very large, difficult-to-amplify expanded allele, the PCR reaction will strongly favor the normal allele. This can lead to the complete failure to detect the expanded allele, a phenomenon known as allelic dropout.\n\n**Analysis of Tetraplet-Primed PCR (TP-PCR) Success:**\nTP-PCR is designed to circumvent these problems. It uses one primer in a unique flanking sequence and another primer that anneals at multiple locations *within* the repeat tract. An amplification product is formed between the flanking primer and the various annealing sites of the repeat-anchored primer. Because the repeat primer can bind anywhere along the vast CCTG array, amplification does not need to traverse the entire expansion. The products generated will have lengths corresponding to the distance from the flanking primer to the various binding sites within the repeat. Since these binding sites are separated by the length of the repeat unit ($4$ bp), the products appear as a \"ladder\" on a gel or capillary electrophoresis trace. The presence of this characteristic ladder is a qualitative indicator that a large expansion is present. This method detects the presence of an expansion without needing to amplify its full length or determine its exact size.\n\n---\n\n### Option-by-Option Evaluation\n\n**A. DM2 expansions frequently exceed the effective amplicon length that conventional flanking PCR can traverse and, with approximately $75\\%$ GC content in the CCTG motif, form stable secondary structures that stall polymerases; TP-PCR uses a repeat-anchored primer with a $5'$ tail to generate a diagnostic ladder in $4$-bp increments without requiring amplification across the entire expansion.**\n- This statement accurately identifies the two primary reasons for conventional PCR failure: the extreme size of the amplicon (often $>44,000$ bp, far exceeding PCR capability) and the high GC content ($75\\%$) leading to polymerase-stalling secondary structures. It then correctly describes the mechanism of TP-PCR, which bypasses these issues by amplifying short products from a fixed flanking primer to multiple sites within the repeat, generating a diagnostic ladder without needing to span the full expansion. All parts of this statement are consistent with the provided principles.\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. TP-PCR is superior because it amplifies messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) rather than genomic DNA, thereby bypassing intronic repeats; conventional PCR fails only because it targets genomic DNA.**\n- This statement is incorrect. The problem clearly states the CCTG repeat is in an intron of the *CNBP* gene. Both conventional PCR and TP-PCR, as described for this genetic test, are designed to amplify genomic DNA (gDNA). Amplifying mRNA (via RT-PCR) would not detect the expansion, as introns are spliced out during mRNA processing and are not present in the mature mRNA template. Thus, the premise that TP-PCR targets mRNA is false. The reason for conventional PCR failure is the nature of the gDNA sequence, not merely the fact that it is gDNA.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The polymorphic $(\\text{TG})_n(\\text{TCTG})_n$ region adjacent to the CCTG array destabilizes flanking primer binding and, coupled with somatic mosaicism that yields a wide template length distribution, promotes allelic dropout of the expanded allele in conventional PCR; TP-PCR mitigates these issues by priming within the CCTG array and reporting presence via a ladder irrespective of exact length.**\n- This statement highlights two additional, valid challenges for conventional PCR. The flanking polymorphic region can indeed interfere with primer design and binding. Somatic mosaicism, combined with the preferential amplification of shorter alleles, is a well-known cause of allelic dropout for large expansions. The statement correctly identifies that TP-PCR mitigates these problems. By using a primer within the conserved CCTG repeat itself, it is less susceptible to flanking polymorphism (on one side, at least). Its qualitative output (the ladder) confirms the presence of an expansion, making the assay robust to the smear of allele sizes caused by mosaicism. This statement is fully supported by the provided principles.\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Conventional PCR fails primarily because the DM2 locus cannot be denatured at high temperature; adding dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) universally resolves the problem, and TP-PCR is chosen only for operational convenience.**\n- This statement contains multiple inaccuracies. While high GC content makes denaturation more difficult, it is not the primary failure mode; polymerase stalling during extension is a more significant issue. Standard PCR denaturation at $\\ge 95^\\circ$C is generally sufficient. The claim that an additive like DMSO \"universally resolves the problem\" is a drastic overstatement; while helpful, it cannot overcome the fundamental limitation of polymerase processivity over tens of thousands of base pairs. Finally, TP-PCR is not chosen for \"convenience\"; it is chosen for necessity, as it represents a fundamentally different and effective strategy for a target that is intractable by conventional methods.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. TP-PCR uniquely provides exact base-pair sizing for very large DM2 expansions, which Southern blotting cannot achieve; therefore TP-PCR is preferred for precise quantification rather than detection.**\n- This statement misrepresents the function of TP-PCR. TP-PCR does *not* provide exact sizing of the full expansion; it is a qualitative or semi-quantitative assay that detects the *presence* of an expansion by generating a ladder pattern. Sizing of very large expansions is traditionally estimated using Southern blotting or, more recently, long-read sequencing. Southern blotting *does* provide size information (albeit with lower resolution than PCR), contrary to the statement's claim. Therefore, TP-PCR is preferred for its robust detection capabilities, not for precise sizing or quantification.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "4500668"}, {"introduction": "A genetic diagnosis is not merely a laboratory result; it is a piece of clinical information that must be interpreted and communicated responsibly to guide patient care.

Larger germline repeats in DM$1$ are associated, on average, with earlier onset and greater severity; in DM$2$, the correlation between measured repeat length and clinical severity is weak or absent across typical clinical cohorts.\n- Somatic mosaicism: repeat lengths are unstable in mitotically active tissues and tend to expand with age; consequently, blood-derived measurements often show a broad distribution rather than a single allele size.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Optimal Reporting Policy\n\nThe central task is to devise a unified policy for two different diseases where the prognostic value of the primary molecular measure (repeat size) differs dramatically.\n\n1.  **Diagnostic Utility**: For both DM$1$ and DM$2$, the presence of an expansion in the pathogenic range is sufficient for diagnosis. A policy should, at a minimum, clearly state this qualitative result.\n\n2.  **Prognostic and Counseling Utility for DM1**:\n    - The problem states that larger *germline* repeats correlate with severity. However, we measure from blood, which exhibits *somatic* expansion. The measured size is not the germline size.\n    - For reproductive counseling, the risk of congenital DM$1$ is linked to \"very large inherited expansions.\" This suggests that the upper range of the allele distribution is clinically significant, as it may reflect the potential for inheriting a large, disease-causing allele. Therefore, an estimate of the upper-bound size is useful in this specific context.\n    - Any quantitative report for DM$1$ must be accompanied by a caveat explaining somatic mosaicism to prevent the clinician from misinterpreting a blood-derived number as a precise predictor of disease course or as the definitive germline allele size.\n\n3.  **Prognostic and Counseling Utility for DM2**:\n    - The problem explicitly states that \"the correlation between measured repeat length and clinical severity is weak or absent.\"\n    - This is a critical distinction from DM$1$. Reporting any specific quantitative size (modal, mean, or upper-bound) for DM$2$ would be highly misleading, as it would imply a prognostic value that does not exist. This would directly violate the goal of minimizing misinterpretation.\n    - The DM$2$ patient example highlights that a modal peak may not even be identifiable, making such a metric impractical.\n    - The most responsible action for DM$2$ is to confirm the presence of the expansion for diagnosis and explicitly state that the size does not correlate with severity.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing a Unified Policy**:\n    - A policy that treats both diseases identically with respect to quantitative reporting (as in options A, B, and D) is inherently flawed because it ignores the fundamental biological difference in their size-severity correlation.\n    - The optimal policy must therefore be conditional. It should have a common basis—reporting the presence of an expansion—but then diverge in its quantitative reporting to reflect the specific clinical utility and potential for misinterpretation for each disease.\n    - **For DM$1$**: Provide a quantitative estimate (specifically the upper-bound, which is relevant for congenital risk) when clinically indicated, but always with caveats about mosaicism.\n    - **For DM$2$**: Avoid quantitative reporting and instead provide an explanatory comment about the lack of correlation.\n\nThis synthesized approach maximizes utility by providing relevant data where it matters (DM$1$) and minimizes harm by preventing misinterpretation where the data is misleading (DM$2$).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Provided Options\n\n**A. Report the modal repeat size as the primary quantitative result for both DM$1$ and DM$2$, because it best approximates the germline progenitor allele and correlates with clinical severity in both disorders.**\n- This statement is factually incorrect according to the problem givens. It claims a size-severity correlation for DM$2$, which the problem explicitly states is \"weak or absent\". Furthermore, the DM$2$ case example indicates a modal peak may not be present, making the policy impractical. Therefore, this option would lead to significant misinterpretation for DM$2$.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Report the upper-bound repeat size for both DM$1$ and DM$2$, because the longest detected molecules reflect the maximum toxic load and therefore best stratify risk and prognosis.**\n- Similar to option A, this policy incorrectly presumes that a quantitative measure (the upper-bound size) can stratify risk and prognosis in DM$2$. The provided information states the size-severity correlation is weak or absent for DM$2$, making this policy misleading. While the upper-bound has utility in DM$1$ for assessing congenital risk, applying the same logic to DM$2$ is not supported by the givens.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Report the presence of an expansion as the principal result in both DM$1$ and DM$2$; for DM$1$, add an upper-bound estimate only when reproductive or neonatal risk counseling is specifically required, coupled to explicit caveats about somatic mosaicism and maternal transmission; for DM$2$, avoid quantitative size reporting and provide a standardized comment that repeat size does not predict severity.**\n- This option perfectly aligns with the derived optimal policy.\n- It correctly identifies the primary diagnostic utility for both diseases: the presence of an expansion.\n- It appropriately tailors the secondary reporting for each disease. For DM$1$, it includes the most relevant quantitative data (upper-bound) for the most critical application (reproductive risk) and mandates necessary caveats. For DM$2$, it proactively prevents misinterpretation by avoiding misleading numbers and providing a clarifying statement. This policy maximizes utility and minimizes misinterpretation.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Report the mean repeat size from the blood distribution for both DM$1$ and DM$2$, because it averages tissue burden, reduces sampling noise, and therefore most accurately predicts multisystemic complications such as cardiomyopathy and respiratory failure.**\n- This option contains unsubstantiated claims. The problem does not state that the mean size from blood \"most accurately predicts\" complications. For DM$2$, any size correlation is noted to be weak or absent. The assertion that a blood-derived mean \"averages tissue burden\" across multiple different tissues is a significant and unproven biological assumption. This policy applies a uniform, and likely misleading, quantitative rule to both diseases.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4500694"}]}
