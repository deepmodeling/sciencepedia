In a large outbred population, suppose a copy-number Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay is used to screen $N = 200000$ unrelated individuals for SMN1 carrier status, where carriers are individuals with one functional copy of SMN1. The assay identifies $n_{+} = 4660$ as carriers.

Report the pair $\\big(q, q^{2}\\big)$ as your final answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the estimation of the rare allele frequency, $q$, and the disease incidence, $q^{2}$, for spinal muscular atrophy in a given population. The solution involves two main stages: first, correcting the observed screening data for assay imperfections (sensitivity and specificity) to estimate the true carrier frequency; second, applying the principles of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) to relate the carrier frequency to the allele frequency.\n\nLet $C$ denote the event that an individual is a true carrier of the recessive allele, and $NC$ be the event that an individual is a non-carrier. Let $T+$ denote a positive test result from the screening assay. The problem provides the following data:\nTotal individuals screened: $N = 200000$.\nNumber of positive tests: $n_{+} = 4660$.\nAssay sensitivity: $\\mathrm{Se} = P(T+\\,|\\,C) = 0.92$.\nAssay specificity: $\\mathrm{Sp} = P(T-\\,|\\,NC) = 0.995$.\n\nFrom the specificity, we can determine the probability of a false positive, which is the probability of a non-carrier testing positive:\n$$P(T+\\,|\\,NC) = 1 - P(T-\\,|\\,NC) = 1 - \\mathrm{Sp} = 1 - 0.995 = 0.005$$\n\nThe observed frequency of positive tests, $f_{T+}$, in the sample is:\n$$f_{T+} = \\frac{n_{+}}{N} = \\frac{4660}{200000} = 0.0233$$\n\nLet $f_C$ be the true, underlying frequency of carriers in the population, i.e., $f_C = P(C)$. The frequency of non-carriers is then $P(NC) = 1 - f_C$. Using the law of total probability, the overall probability of a positive test, $P(T+)$, can be expressed as:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+\\,|\\,C)P(C) + P(T+\\,|\\,NC)P(NC)$$\n\nSubstituting the known quantities and variables into this equation:\n$$f_{T+} = \\mathrm{Se} \\cdot f_C + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp})(1 - f_C)$$\n\nWe can now solve this linear equation for $f_C$, the true carrier frequency.\n$$f_{T+} = \\mathrm{Se} \\cdot f_C + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp}) - (1 - \\mathrm{Sp}) \\cdot f_C$$\n$$f_{T+} - (1 - \\mathrm{Sp}) = f_C \\cdot (\\mathrm{Se} - (1 - \\mathrm{Sp}))$$\n$$f_{T+} - 1 + \\mathrm{Sp} = f_C \\cdot (\\mathrm{Se} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1)$$\n$$f_C = \\frac{f_{T+} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1}{\\mathrm{Se} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1}$$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$f_C = \\frac{0.0233 + 0.995 - 1}{0.92 + 0.995 - 1} = \\frac{0.0183}{0.915}$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can write it as $\\frac{183 \\times 10^{-4}}{915 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{183}{9150}$. Since $183 = 3 \\times 61$ and $9150 = 50 \\times 183$, the fraction simplifies:\n$$f_C = \\frac{183}{50 \\times 183} = \\frac{1}{50} = 0.02$$\nThus, the estimated true carrier frequency in the population is $2\\%$.\n\nNext, we apply the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium principle. Let $q$ be the frequency of the recessive allele (SMN1 loss-of-function) and $p$ be the frequency of the normal allele. We have the relation $p + q = 1$. Under HWE, the frequencies of the three genotypes (normal homozygous, heterozygous carrier, affected homozygous) are $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$, respectively.\n\nThe carrier frequency, $f_C$, corresponds to the frequency of heterozygotes:\n$$f_C = 2pq$$\n\nThe problem states that we may assume $q$ is small and thus $p = 1 - q \\approx 1$. This is a standard and appropriate approximation for rare recessive diseases. With this assumption, the carrier frequency can be approximated as:\n$$f_C \\approx 2(1)q = 2q$$\n\nUsing our estimated value for $f_C$:\n$$0.02 \\approx 2q$$\nSolving for $q$, we find the frequency of the recessive allele:\n$$q \\approx \\frac{0.02}{2} = 0.01$$\n\nThis value of $q=0.01$ is indeed small, justifying the earlier approximation ($p = 1-0.01 = 0.99 \\approx 1$).\n\nFinally, we compute the expected incidence of the autosomal recessive disease, which corresponds to the frequency of affected individuals (genotype with biallelic loss of SMN1). Under HWE, this incidence is $q^2$.\n$$q^2 = (0.01)^2 = 0.0001$$\n\nThe problem requires that the final incidence $q^2$ be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures. The value $0.0001$ has one significant figure. To express it with four, we add trailing zeros: $0.0001000$.\n\nThe final answer is the pair $(q, q^2)$.\n$$q = 0.01$$\n$$q^2 = 0.0001000$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.01  0.0001000 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4526729"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of population screening, this exercise introduces a crucial real-world complexity in SMA genetics: the 'silent carrier'. This phenomenon, where an individual carries a null allele but has a normal gene copy number due to a duplication on the other chromosome, can lead to underestimation of true carrier frequency if not properly accounted for.

A carrier is an individual with one haplotype lacking SMN1 ($0$) and the other haplotype bearing at least one functional SMN1 ($\\geq 1$). Standard clinical carrier screening often uses a copy-number assay that reports total SMN1 copies per genome (summed across homologous chromosomes). Under a naive rule, only individuals with a total of 1 SMN1 copy are called carriers. However, some carriers are “silent” because they have two copies of SMN1 on one chromosome and zero on the other (2+0), thus the copy-number assay reports $2$ despite one null haplotype.\n\nStarting from the fundamental principles of autosomal recessive inheritance and Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), and assuming full penetrance and negligible de novo mutation, consider a large, randomly mating population where a copy-number assay reports that a proportion $m = 0.017$ of individuals have a total of $1$ SMN1 copy. Independent haplotype marker analysis shows that a fraction $s = 0.15$ of all carriers are silent (2+0) carriers who will not be detected by the naive copy-number rule.

Under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), let $q$ denote the frequency of the SMN1-null haplotype and $p = 1 - q$ the frequency of the functional haplotype. The genotype frequencies at the haplotype locus are:\n- Homozygous functional: $p^2$,\n- Heterozygous (carriers): $2pq$,\n- Homozygous null (affected): $q^2$.\n\nThese follow from the core HWE principle that allele combinations form as products of allele frequencies under random mating.\n\nThe clinical copy-number assay reports total SMN1 copies per diploid genome. By definition, carriers are those with one null haplotype ($0$) and one functional haplotype ($\\geq 1$). Without any within-chromosome duplications, carriers would present a total of $1$ copy (1+0). However, some carriers have a duplication on the functional haplotype such that the total is $2$ (2+0). These “silent” carriers violate the naive copy-number rule that equates total $1$ copy with carrier status, because a fraction of true carriers has total $2$ copies and is not detected.\n\nLet $C_{\\text{true}}$ denote the true carrier proportion under HWE:\n$$\nC_{\\text{true}} = 2pq = 2q(1 - q).\n$$\nLet $s$ be the fraction of carriers who are silent (2+0).

Absence of sensory symptoms.\n- **Physical Examination:** Proximal weakness greater than distal weakness, hypotonia, globally reduced deep tendon reflexes, and absence of spasticity.\n- **Laboratory Data:** Serum creatine kinase (CK) is mildly elevated at $350$ U/L (upper limit of normal $200$ U/L).\n- **Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS):** Normal sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs), normal motor conduction velocities, and mildly reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes in proximal muscles.\n- **Needle Electromyography (EMG):** In multiple muscles (deltoid, vastus lateralis, tibialis anterior):\n    - **At rest:** Abundant fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves firing at $2$–$8$ Hz.\n    - **During voluntary contraction:** Motor unit potentials (MUPs) with large amplitudes ($5.5$–$9.0$ mV) and long durations ($15$–$22$ ms).

The clinical presentation, electrodiagnostic findings, and genetic information are a classic and consistent description of a milder, adult-onset form of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), likely SMA type III or IV. The described pathophysiology of anterior horn cell loss and the resultant EMG changes are well-established scientific principles.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a comprehensive dataset and asks for a specific interpretation that connects the findings to a confirmed underlying disease. The information is sufficient to arrive at a single, correct pathophysiological explanation.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem uses standard, objective medical and electrophysiological terminology. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n4.  **Consistency:** The provided data are internally consistent. The clinical signs of a pure lower motor neuron (LMN) disorder (weakness, hypotonia, reduced reflexes, no spasticity, no sensory loss) are perfectly matched by the electrodiagnostic evidence of a chronic motor neuronopathy (normal sensory studies, EMG signs of denervation and chronic reinnervation) and the confirmed genetic diagnosis of SMA. For instance, normal motor conduction velocities correctly rule out a primary demyelinating neuropathy, and the absence of a decrement on RNS correctly argues against a disorder like myasthenia gravis. The presence of $3$ copies of the *SMN2* gene is consistent with the milder, later-onset phenotype described.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action ###\nThe problem statement is valid, scientifically sound, internally consistent, and well-posed. The solution process can proceed.\n\n## Solution Derivation ##\n\nThe problem requires an interpretation of the electrodiagnostic findings in the context of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which is confirmed by the genetic data. SMA is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the loss of the *SMN1* gene, leading to insufficient levels of the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) protein. This protein deficiency results in the progressive degeneration of alpha motor neurons located in the anterior horn of the spinal cord.\n\n1.  **Pathophysiology to Denervation:** The death of an anterior horn cell (a lower motor neuron) results in the denervation of all muscle fibers within its motor unit. These denervated muscle fibers become spontaneously active. On needle EMG, this spontaneous activity is recorded at rest as **fibrillation potentials** and **positive sharp waves**. The finding of \"abundant\" such potentials confirms a significant, ongoing process of denervation.\n\n2.  **Pathophysiology to Reinnervation:** In a slowly progressive disorder like this form of SMA, surviving, healthy motor neurons can extend new axonal branches (collateral sprouting) to reinnervate the orphaned, denervated muscle fibers. This process of reinnervation leads to several key changes in the structure and function of the surviving motor units:\n    - **Enlargement of Motor Units:** A single surviving motor neuron now controls a much larger number of muscle fibers than it did originally.\n    - **Changes in MUP characteristics:** When this new, giant motor unit is activated, the summation of action potentials from its greatly increased number of muscle fibers produces a **large-amplitude MUP**. The observed amplitudes of $5.5$–$9.0$ mV are indeed very large (normal is typically $ 2$ mV). Furthermore, the conduction along the newly formed, often thinly myelinated, axonal sprouts is slower and less synchronous than in a healthy unit. This temporal dispersion of muscle fiber activation within the unit leads to a **long-duration MUP**. The observed durations of $15$–$22$ ms are significantly prolonged (normal is typically $5$–$15$ ms). The unstable and asynchronous activation can also cause the MUP to have multiple phases, explaining the **polyphasic MUPs**.\n    - **Reduced Recruitment:** Due to the extensive loss of motor neurons, there are far fewer motor units available to be activated (recruited) to generate increasing muscle force. To compensate, the few remaining giant motor units must fire at a very high frequency. This is precisely what is described as \"markedly reduced recruitment such that a single large motor unit accelerates firing to generate force.\" This is a cardinal sign of a neurogenic (specifically, motor neuron or axonal) lesion.\n    - **Increased Jitter on SFEMG:** The newly formed neuromuscular junctions from collateral sprouts are often immature and functionally less stable than original junctions. This leads to increased variability in synaptic transmission time, which is measured as **increased jitter** on single-fiber EMG.\n\n3.  **Other Findings:**\n    - **Normal SNAPs and Motor Conduction Velocities:** The pathology is at the level of the motor neuron cell body (anterior horn cell), not the sensory nerve or the myelin sheath of the peripheral motor axon. Thus, sensory studies and motor conduction velocities are expected to be normal.\n    - **Reduced CMAPs:** The CMAP represents the sum of all MUPs in a muscle. With the net loss of muscle fibers due to incomplete reinnervation over time, the CMAP amplitude is reduced.\n\nIn summary, the constellation of EMG findings—abundant fibrillation potentials with large-amplitude, long-duration, polyphasic MUPs, and markedly reduced recruitment—is the classic electrophysiological signature of a chronic neurogenic process characterized by denervation and successful reinnervation. This perfectly reflects the underlying pathophysiology of motor neuron loss and compensatory collateral sprouting in SMA.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis ##\n\n**A. Loss of anterior horn cells due to SMN1 disruption causes widespread denervation; surviving lower motor neurons undergo collateral axonal sprouting to reinnervate orphaned muscle fibers, enlarging motor unit territories and producing large-amplitude, long-duration MUPs with reduced recruitment on EMG.**\nThis option accurately describes the entire sequence of events in SMA. It correctly identifies the primary lesion (loss of anterior horn cells), the cause (SMN1 disruption), the immediate consequence (denervation), the compensatory mechanism (collateral sprouting), and the resulting EMG signatures (large-amplitude, long-duration MUPs with reduced recruitment). This aligns perfectly with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. A primary myopathic process with ongoing myofiber necrosis explains the EMG: small-amplitude, short-duration MUPs with early recruitment and abundant fibrillation potentials reflect fiber membrane instability from myonecrosis.**\nThis option describes a myopathy. The classic EMG findings in a myopathy are small-amplitude, short-duration MUPs due to the loss of fibers within a motor unit, and early recruitment because more motor units are needed to generate force. This is the opposite of the findings in the problem statement, which are large MUPs and reduced recruitment.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. A predominantly demyelinating polyneuropathy induces temporal dispersion and conduction block; slowed motor conduction velocities generate large, long-duration MUPs on needle EMG, accounting for the findings.**\nThis option describes a demyelinating neuropathy. A cardinal feature of such a condition is significantly slowed motor conduction velocities. The problem explicitly states that motor conduction velocities are normal, directly contradicting this option. SMA is a neuronopathy, not a demyelinating polyneuropathy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A neuromuscular junction transmission disorder such as myasthenia gravis causes decrement on low-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation and small, unstable MUPs with increased jitter; these account for the large-amplitude, long-duration MUPs observed.**\nThis option describes a neuromuscular junction (NMJ) disorder. The statement contains two major errors. First, a key sign of myasthenia gravis is a decrement on RNS, but the problem states there is \"no significant decrement.\" Second, it nonsensically claims that the \"small, unstable MUPs\" characteristic of NMJ disorders \"account for the large-amplitude, long-duration MUPs observed,\" which is a direct contradiction. While increased jitter is seen in both NMJ disorders and reinnervation, all other findings point away from a primary NMJ disorder.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Selective degeneration of upper motor neurons in the corticospinal tract leads to spasticity; compensatory changes in lower motor neurons produce the large-amplitude, long-duration MUPs and reduced recruitment seen on EMG in this case.**\nThis option describes an upper motor neuron (UMN) disorder. The clinical signs of a UMN lesion are spasticity and hyperreflexia. The patient presents with the opposite: hypotonia and reduced reflexes. The EMG findings of denervation and reinnervation reflect a lower motor neuron pathology, not a compensatory change for a UMN problem. This option is inconsistent with both the clinical exam and the pathophysiology.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4526698"}]}
