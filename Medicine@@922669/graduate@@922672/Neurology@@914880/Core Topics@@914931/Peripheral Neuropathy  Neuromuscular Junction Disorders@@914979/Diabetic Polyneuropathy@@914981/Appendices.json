The patient underwent a distal leg skin biopsy, and the intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD), measured as fibers per millimeter, was quantified using protein gene product 9.5 immunostaining. Age-matched control data for the same biopsy site indicate a reference distribution with mean IENFD of $\\mu = 8.2$ fibers per millimeter and standard deviation (SD) of $\\sigma = 1.6$ fibers per millimeter.

The use of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) as a biomarker for diabetic polyneuropathy is an established practice in neurology. The statistical methodology is sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

The instructions are clear and unambiguous.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using objective, quantitative language. There are no subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to determine if the patient's measured IENFD of $x = 5.3$ fibers per millimeter is statistically significantly lower than the mean of the healthy control population, which is characterized by a normal distribution with mean $\\mu = 8.2$ fibers per millimeter and standard deviation $\\sigma = 1.6$ fibers per millimeter. This is achieved by performing a one-sided, lower-tail hypothesis test at a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\nThe null hypothesis, $H_0$, is that the patient's IENFD is not abnormally low, meaning it is drawn from the control distribution. The alternative hypothesis, $H_1$, is that the patient's IENFD is abnormally low.\n$H_0$: The patient's true IENFD is greater than or equal to the control mean, $\\mu_{patient} \\ge \\mu$.\n$H_1$: The patient's true IENFD is less than the control mean, $\\mu_{patient} < \\mu$.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the test statistic, which is the standardized normal deviate, or $z$-score. The formula for the $z$-score is:\n$$z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\nSubstituting the given values into this formula:\n$$z = \\frac{5.3 - 8.2}{1.6}$$\n$$z = \\frac{-2.9}{1.6}$$\n$$z = -1.8125$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value has five significant figures ($1$, $8$, $1$, $2$, $5$). To round to four significant figures, we examine the fifth digit. Since it is $5$, we round up the fourth digit.\nTherefore, the rounded $z$-score is $z \\approx -1.813$.\n\nThe next step is to make a decision based on this $z$-score. For a one-sided, lower-tail test with a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$, we find the critical value $z_{crit}$ from the standard normal distribution table, which corresponds to the quantile below which $5\\%$ of the distribution lies.\n$$P(Z < z_{crit}) = \\alpha = 0.05$$\nThe critical value is $z_{crit} \\approx -1.645$.\n\nThe decision rule is to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ if the calculated test statistic $z$ is less than the critical value $z_{crit}$.\nWe compare our calculated $z$-score to the critical value:\n$$z = -1.8125$$\n$$z_{crit} \\approx -1.645$$\nSince $-1.8125 < -1.645$, the calculated $z$-score falls into the rejection region. We therefore reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ in favor of the alternative hypothesis $H_1$. This indicates that the patient's IENFD is statistically significantly lower than the mean of the control population at the $\\alpha=0.05$ significance level.\n\nThe problem defines a binary decision variable $D$ such that $D=1$ if the result is abnormal (i.e., we reject $H_0$), and $D=0$ otherwise. Since we have rejected $H_0$, the result is deemed abnormal. Thus, $D=1$.\n\nThe final answer is to be presented as a row vector $\\begin{pmatrix} z & D \\end{pmatrix}$, where $z$ is the rounded score.\nThe components are $z = -1.813$ and $D=1$.\nThe resulting vector is $\\begin{pmatrix} -1.813 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1.813 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4475585"}, {"introduction": "Once diabetic polyneuropathy is identified, quantifying its severity is essential for staging, monitoring progression, and assessing therapeutic response.

Assume the following well-established facts and definitions as the fundamental base for your derivation: (i) for large-fiber peripheral nerves, the recorded action potential amplitude is approximately proportional to the number of functioning axons, (ii) diabetic polyneuropathy is length-dependent and involves sensory fibers earlier and often more severely than motor fibers, and (iii) when combining independent contributors to impairment into a single scalar measure, it is scientifically reasonable to treat each contributor as an orthogonal component in a weighted composite, where weights reflect their relative contribution to clinically relevant disability.

First, premise (i) states that the action potential amplitude, $A$, is approximately proportional to the number of functioning axons, $N$. We can write this as $A \\propto N$, or $A = kN$ for some constant of proportionality $k$ that depends on the specific nerve and recording setup.\n\nThe severity of neuropathy is related to the loss of functioning axons. A dimensionless measure of this loss can be formulated as the fractional reduction in axons compared to a healthy, normative state. For a given nerve type (motor or sensory), let $N_{\\mathrm{norm}}$ be the normative number of axons and $N_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ be the measured number of axons in the patient.

This mathematical structure corresponds to the magnitude of a vector in a weighted feature space. If $I_m$ and $I_s$ are the components along two orthogonal axes, and $w_m$ and $w_s$ are their respective weights, the combined severity index, $S$, is the weighted Euclidean norm:\n$$\nS = \\sqrt{(w_m I_m)^2 + (w_s I_s)^2}\n$$\nThis formula provides the dimensionless, axon-count-referenced severity index that combines the motor and sensory amplitude reductions as requested in part (a) of the problem.\n\nNow, for part (b), we compute the value of $S$ using the given data:\nMotor amplitudes: $A_{m}^{\\mathrm{norm}} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$, $A_{m}^{\\mathrm{meas}} = 6 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$.\nSensory amplitudes: $A_{s}^{\\mathrm{norm}} = 20 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu V}$, $A_{s}^{\\mathrm{meas}} = 4 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu V}$.\nWeights: $w_{m} = 1$, $w_{s} = 2$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the individual impairment components, $I_m$ and $I_s$:\n$$\nI_m = 1 - \\frac{6 \\ \\mathrm{mV}}{10 \\ \\mathrm{mV}} = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4\n$$\n$$\nI_s = 1 - \\frac{4 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu V}}{20 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu V}} = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8\n$$\nNote that the units cancel, making $I_m$ and $I_s$ dimensionless, as required.\n\nNext, we substitute these values and the weights into the formula for the severity index $S$:\n$$\nS = \\sqrt{(w_m I_m)^2 + (w_s I_s)^2} = \\sqrt{(1 \\times 0.4)^2 + (2 \\times 0.8)^2}\n$$\n$$\nS = \\sqrt{(0.4)^2 + (1.6)^2}\n$$\n$$\nS = \\sqrt{0.16 + 2.56}\n$$\n$$\nS = \\sqrt{2.72}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round it to four significant figures as instructed:\n$$\nS \\approx 1.64924225...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $S \\approx 1.649$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.649}$$", "id": "4475554"}, {"introduction": "Modern management of diabetes is increasingly focused on risk stratification and prevention of complications.
