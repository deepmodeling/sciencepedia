This first practice focuses on haploinsufficiency, a common mechanism in dominant forms of CMT.

Skipping this exon introduces a frameshift with a premature termination codon positioned more than $55$ nucleotides upstream of the final exon–exon junction, thereby engaging nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Assume the following, each grounded in widely accepted molecular genetics principles: (i) the Central Dogma (deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein), (ii) steady-state protein dosage is proportional to the abundance of its correctly spliced messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) when translation efficiency and protein stability are otherwise unchanged, (iii) in a diploid cell with two MPZ alleles, both alleles have equal transcriptional output in the wild-type state, (iv) NMD is complete for any aberrant mRNA bearing the premature termination codon, producing zero protein from those transcripts, and (v) there is no compensatory upregulation of the wild-type allele.\n\nExperimental minigene assays indicate that in the presence of the mutation, exon skipping occurs in $90\\%$ of transcripts originating from the mutant allele, while the remaining $10\\%$ from that allele are correctly spliced and produce functional protein indistinguishable in translation efficiency and stability from wild-type. The wild-type allele remains unaffected and produces only correctly spliced transcripts.\n\nUsing these premises and starting from the definition of gene dosage as the sum of functional protein contributions from each allele, compute the expected reduction in steady-state functional MPZ protein dosage relative to the wild-type two-allele state.

The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of molecular genetics, well-posed, and objective.\n\nLet us define the relevant quantities based on the provided information.\n\nLet $P_{WT}$ represent the amount of functional protein produced from a single wild-type MPZ allele under normal conditions. In a diploid wild-type individual, there are two such alleles. Based on assumption (iii), that both alleles have equal transcriptional output, the total protein dosage in a wild-type state, $D_{WT}$, is the sum of the contributions from each of the two alleles.\n$$D_{WT} = P_{WT} + P_{WT} = 2 P_{WT}$$\nFor the purpose of calculating a relative change, we can normalize the wild-type dosage to $1$.\n$$D_{WT} = 1$$\nThis normalization implies that the contribution from a single wild-type allele is:\n$$P_{WT} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$\n\nNow, we consider the heterozygous individual, who possesses one wild-type allele and one mutant allele. The total protein dosage in this heterozygous state, $D_{het}$, is the sum of the contributions from the wild-type allele ($P_{het,WT}$) and the mutant allele ($P_{het,MUT}$).\n$$D_{het} = P_{het,WT} + P_{het,MUT}$$\n\nAccording to assumption (v), there is no compensatory upregulation of the wild-type allele. Therefore, its protein contribution remains the same as in the wild-type state.\n$$P_{het,WT} = P_{WT} = 0.5$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the contribution from the mutant allele, $P_{het,MUT}$. The problem states that the transcriptional output of the mutant allele is the same as the wild-type allele. However, the resulting transcripts undergo differential splicing.\nA fraction of the transcripts from the mutant allele, given as $f_{skip} = 90\\% = 0.90$, undergoes exon skipping. This leads to a frameshift and a premature termination codon (PTC). According to assumption (iv), nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is complete for these aberrant transcripts, resulting in zero protein production from them.\nThe remaining fraction of transcripts, $f_{correct} = 10\\% = 0.10$, are correctly spliced. These transcripts produce functional protein that is indistinguishable from wild-type protein in terms of translation efficiency and stability.\n\nTherefore, the functional protein contribution from the mutant allele is the product of the fraction of correctly spliced transcripts and the protein amount that would be produced from a normal allele.\n$$P_{het,MUT} = f_{correct} \\times P_{WT} + f_{skip} \\times 0$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P_{het,MUT} = 0.10 \\times 0.5 + 0.90 \\times 0 = 0.05$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the total protein dosage in the heterozygous state, $D_{het}$.\n$$D_{het} = P_{het,WT} + P_{het,MUT} = 0.5 + 0.05 = 0.55$$\nThis value represents the total functional protein level in the heterozygote, relative to the normalized wild-type level of $1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the reduction in protein dosage relative to the wild-type state. The absolute reduction is the difference between the wild-type and heterozygous dosages.\n$$\\text{Absolute Reduction} = D_{WT} - D_{het} = 1 - 0.55 = 0.45$$\nThe relative reduction, $R$, is this absolute reduction divided by the wild-type dosage.\n$$R = \\frac{D_{WT} - D_{het}}{D_{WT}}$$\nSubstituting the normalized values:\n$$R = \\frac{1 - 0.55}{1} = 0.45$$\n\nThe expected reduction in steady-state functional MPZ protein dosage is $0.45$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and expressed in objective, formal language. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the relative initial template ratio, $R$, between a sample suspected of gene duplication ('dup') and a wild-type sample ('wt'). This is followed by a numerical calculation and an interpretation of the result in the context of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease diagnostics.\n\nThe core principle of qPCR analysis is that the number of cycles required to reach a fixed fluorescence threshold, known as the cycle threshold ($C_t$), is inversely related to the logarithm of the initial amount of template DNA. The fundamental equation provided is for the quantity of amplicon, $Q(n)$, after $n$ cycles, starting with an initial quantity $Q(0)$ and a constant amplification efficiency per cycle, $E$:\n$$Q(n) = Q(0) E^n$$\nThe cycle threshold, $C_t$, is defined by the cycle number at which the amplicon quantity reaches a fixed threshold value, $Q_T$:\n$$Q_T = Q(0) E^{C_t}$$\nThis relationship can be established for both the duplication sample and the wild-type sample. It is a critical assumption in relative quantification that the fluorescence threshold $Q_T$ is set to the same value for both reactions being compared.\n\nFor the duplication sample (dup):\n$$Q_T = Q^{\\text{dup}}(0) E^{C_{t,\\text{dup}}}$$\n\nFor the wild-type sample (wt):\n$$Q_T = Q^{\\text{wt}}(0) E^{C_{t,\\text{wt}}}$$\n\nSince $Q_T$ is identical for both expressions, we can set them equal to each other:\n$$Q^{\\text{dup}}(0) E^{C_{t,\\text{dup}}} = Q^{\\text{wt}}(0) E^{C_{t,\\text{wt}}}$$\n\nThe goal is to find an expression for the relative initial template ratio, $R = \\dfrac{Q^{\\text{dup}}(0)}{Q^{\\text{wt}}(0)}$. We can rearrange the equation above to solve for this ratio:\n$$\\frac{Q^{\\text{dup}}(0)}{Q^{\\text{wt}}(0)} = \\frac{E^{C_{t,\\text{wt}}}}{E^{C_{t,\\text{dup}}}}$$\nUsing the property of exponents $\\frac{a^x}{a^y} = a^{x-y}$, we get:\n$$R = E^{C_{t,\\text{wt}} - C_{t,\\text{dup}}}$$\nThe problem defines the difference in cycle thresholds as $\\Delta C_t = C_{t,\\text{dup}} - C_{t,\\text{wt}}$. The exponent in our expression for $R$ is $C_{t,\\text{wt}} - C_{t,\\text{dup}}$, which is the negative of $\\Delta C_t$. Therefore, we can write the final expression for $R$ in terms of $E$ and $\\Delta C_t$:\n$$R = E^{-\\Delta C_t}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the relative initial template ratio.\n\nNext, we are asked to compute the numerical value of $R$ given the experimental values. The problem states an ideal amplification efficiency $E=2$ and a measured cycle threshold difference $\\Delta C_t = -1.0$. Substituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$R = 2^{-(-1.0)}$$\n$$R = 2^{1.0}$$\n$$R = 2$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$R = 2.000$$\n\nFinally, we must interpret this result. The calculated ratio $R = 2.000$ signifies that the initial quantity of the PMP$22$ gene target in the test sample is two times greater than that in the wild-type calibrator sample. The problem states that \"the expectation for an exact duplication is approximately a two-fold increase in copy number\". Our calculated value of $R = 2.000$ perfectly matches this stated expectation. Therefore, the qPCR result strongly supports the clinical suspicion of a PMP$22$ gene duplication, which is the common cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type $1$A. The negative $\\Delta C_t$ value of $-1.0$ is consistent with a higher initial template concentration in the patient's sample, as it requires one fewer cycle to reach the fluorescence threshold compared to the wild-type sample.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.000}$$", "id": "4497019"}, {"introduction": "From the individual patient, we now scale up to the population level to understand the genetic burden of CMT.
