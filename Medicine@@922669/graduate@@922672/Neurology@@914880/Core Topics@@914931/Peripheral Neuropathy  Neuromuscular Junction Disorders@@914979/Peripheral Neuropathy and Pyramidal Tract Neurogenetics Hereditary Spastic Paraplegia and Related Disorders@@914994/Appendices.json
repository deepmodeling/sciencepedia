It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in population genetics, based on the established principles of Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). All necessary data and assumptions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation and calculation of the mutant allele frequency and the heterozygote carrier frequency for a rare autosomal recessive (AR) disorder. The population is assumed to be at Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium.\n\nLet us define the two alleles at the single locus in question:\n- Let $A$ be the wild-type allele.\n- Let $a$ be the recessive, loss-of-function mutant allele that causes Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) when in the homozygous state ($aa$).\n\nLet the frequencies of these alleles in the population be:\n- $p$ = frequency of the wild-type allele, $A$.\n- $q$ = frequency of the mutant allele, $a$.\n\nAs there are only two alleles at this locus, the sum of their frequencies must equal $1$:\n$$p + q = 1$$\n\nUnder the conditions of Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (random mating, no selection, no mutation, no migration, large population size), the frequencies of the three possible genotypes ($AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$) are given by the terms of the binomial expansion of $(p+q)^2$:\n- Frequency of homozygous wild-type genotype ($AA$): $f(AA) = p^2$\n- Frequency of heterozygous carrier genotype ($Aa$): $f(Aa) = 2pq$\n- Frequency of homozygous mutant genotype ($aa$): $f(aa) = q^2$\n\nThe sum of these genotype frequencies is $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = (p+q)^2 = 1^2 = 1$, as expected.\n\nThe problem states that the disease is autosomal recessive and has full penetrance. This means that an individual will express the disease phenotype if and only if they have the homozygous recessive genotype, $aa$. Therefore, the prevalence of the disease, $P$, is equal to the frequency of the $aa$ genotype.\n$$P = f(aa)$$\n\nFrom the HWE principle, we have $f(aa) = q^2$. Thus, we can relate the disease prevalence directly to the mutant allele frequency:\n$$P = q^2$$\n\nThe first part of the task is to derive the mutant allele frequency, $q$. By taking the square root of the above equation, we obtain the expression for $q$:\n$$q = \\sqrt{P}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the mutant allele frequency.\n\nThe second part of the task is to derive the heterozygote carrier frequency. Heterozygote carriers are individuals with the genotype $Aa$. According to the HWE principle, the frequency of this genotype is given by:\n$$f(Aa) = 2pq$$\nThis is the derived expression for the heterozygote carrier frequency in terms of the allele frequencies $p$ and $q$. Since $p=1-q$, this can also be written as $2(1-q)q$.\n\nNow, we must compute the numerical values for these two quantities. The problem provides the clinically ascertained prevalence of the disease:\n$$P = \\frac{1}{200{,}000} = 0.000005 = 5 \\times 10^{-6}$$\n\nUsing the derived formula for $q$, we can calculate its numerical value:\n$$q = \\sqrt{P} = \\sqrt{5 \\times 10^{-6}} = \\sqrt{5} \\times 10^{-3}$$\n$$q \\approx 2.236067977... \\times 10^{-3} \\approx 0.002236067977...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the mutant allele frequency is:\n$$q \\approx 0.002236$$\n\nNext, we calculate the heterozygote carrier frequency, $2pq$. We can first find $p$:\n$$p = 1 - q \\approx 1 - 0.002236067977... = 0.997763932...$$\nNow, we compute the carrier frequency using the unrounded values of $p$ and $q$ for accuracy:\n$$f(Aa) = 2pq \\approx 2 \\times (0.997763932...) \\times (0.002236067977...)$$\n$$f(Aa) \\approx 0.0044621359...$$\nAlternatively, using the expression $2q(1-q) = 2q - 2q^2 = 2q - 2P$:\n$$f(Aa) = 2 \\times (\\sqrt{5 \\times 10^{-6}}) - 2 \\times (5 \\times 10^{-6})$$\n$$f(Aa) \\approx 2 \\times (0.002236067977...) - 0.00001 = 0.00447213595... - 0.00001 = 0.00446213595...$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures, the heterozygote carrier frequency is:\n$$f(Aa) \\approx 0.004462$$\n\nThe two required numerical results are the mutant allele frequency, $q \\approx 0.002236$, and the heterozygote carrier frequency, $f(Aa) \\approx 0.004462$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.002236 & 0.004462 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4514372"}, {"introduction": "Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias are defined by the progressive degeneration of the corticospinal tracts, the long motor pathways extending from the brain's cortex to the spinal cord.

The data provided are physiologically plausible for a patient with a disorder affecting the corticospinal tracts. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary objective is to compute the Central Motor Conduction Time (CMCT) and a binary indicator $I$. The CMCT is defined as the central component of the cortical Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) latency, $L_{\\mathrm{MEP}}$.

Let the conduction time for this segment be $t_{\\text{proximal}}$.\n- The path from the stimulation site to the tibialis anterior muscle is the distal segment. The conduction time for this segment, including neuromuscular transmission and muscle activation, is given by the M-wave latency, $L_M$.\n\nThe total peripheral motor conduction time (PCT) is the time taken for a signal to travel from the AHC to the muscle. This is the sum of the conduction times of the proximal and distal segments.\n$$ \\text{PCT} = t_{\\text{proximal}} + L_M $$\n\nNow, consider the F-wave. The F-wave is generated by an antidromic impulse traveling from the stimulation site up to the AHC, which then backfires and travels orthodromically back down the entire peripheral nerve to the muscle.\nThe F-wave latency, $L_F^{\\min}$, is composed of:\n1.  The antidromic conduction time from the stimulation site to the AHC. Assuming uniform conduction velocity, this is equal to the orthodromic proximal conduction time, $t_{\\text{proximal}}$.\n2.
