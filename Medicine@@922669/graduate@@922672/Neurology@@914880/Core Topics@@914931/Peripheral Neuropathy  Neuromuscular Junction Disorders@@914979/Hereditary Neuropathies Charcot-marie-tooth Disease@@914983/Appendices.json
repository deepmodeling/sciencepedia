One parent is clinically affected with CMT1A caused by a heterozygous duplication of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (*PMP22*) gene on chromosome 17. The other partner is clinically unaffected and has no personal or family history of CMT. Assume the following foundational genetic principles and conditions hold:\n\n- Autosomal dominant inheritance: a single duplicated *PMP22* allele is sufficient to cause the CMT1A phenotype.\n- Law of segregation in meiosis: each gamete from a heterozygous parent carries either the duplicated allele or the normal allele with equal probability.\n- Full penetrance: the probability that an individual with at least one duplicated *PMP22* allele expresses the phenotype is $f=1$.\n- No de novo events: the probability that a new *PMP22* duplication arises in a gamete from the unaffected partner or post-zygotically is $d=0$.\n- The affected parent is heterozygous for the duplication, and the unaffected partner does not carry the duplication.\n\nUsing these assumptions and starting from the definitions of autosomal dominant transmission, the law of segregation, and penetrance, derive the recurrence risk that a single offspring of this couple will be clinically affected with CMT1A.

Let the duplicated *PMP22* allele be denoted by $A$ and the normal allele by $a$. The affected parent is heterozygous, with genotype $A a$, and the unaffected partner is homozygous normal, with genotype $a a$.\n\nBy the law of segregation, each gamete from the heterozygous parent carries either allele $A$ or allele $a$ with equal probability. Therefore, the probability that the affected parent transmits the duplicated allele is\n$$\nP(\\text{transmit } A) = \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nThe unaffected partner can only contribute the normal allele $a$ because they are $a a$ and there are no de novo events. Thus, the possible offspring genotypes and their probabilities are:\n- $A a$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$,\n- $a a$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nUnder autosomal dominant inheritance and full penetrance $f=1$, any child with genotype $A a$ will be clinically affected, and any child with genotype $a a$ will be unaffected.

The first is to calculate the segmental motor nerve conduction velocity in a patient. The second is to classify the subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease based on a provided genetic result. I will address each task sequentially.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Segmental Conduction Velocity ($v$)**\n\nThe problem states that the conduction velocity, which we denote as $v$, is defined as the path length divided by the transit time. The path length is the inter-stimulation distance, $d$, and the transit time is the difference in onset latencies between the proximal and distal stimulation sites, $t$. This relationship is expressed by the formula:\n$$v = \\frac{d}{t}$$\n\nThe given values are:\n- Inter-stimulation distance: $d = 80$ $\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Difference in onset latencies: $t = 4.0$ $\\mathrm{ms}$\n\nThe final answer for the velocity must be in units of meters per second ($\\mathrm{m/s}$). Therefore, the given values for distance and time must be converted to the base SI units of meters ($\\mathrm{m}$) and seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$), respectively.\n\nFirst, we convert the distance $d$ from millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$) to meters ($\\mathrm{m}$):\n$$1 \\mathrm{m} = 1000 \\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$d = 80 \\mathrm{mm} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{m}}{1000 \\mathrm{mm}} = 80 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{m} = 0.080 \\mathrm{m}$$\n\nNext, we convert the time $t$ from milliseconds ($\\mathrm{ms}$) to seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$):\n$$1 \\mathrm{s} = 1000 \\mathrm{ms}$$\n$$t = 4.0 \\mathrm{ms} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{s}}{1000 \\mathrm{ms}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{s} = 0.0040 \\mathrm{s}$$\n\nNow we can substitute these converted values into the velocity formula:\n$$v = \\frac{0.080 \\mathrm{m}}{0.0040 \\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{80 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{m}}{4.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{s}}$$\n\nThe factor of $10^{-3}$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out, simplifying the calculation:\n$$v = \\frac{80}{4.0} \\mathrm{m/s} = 20 \\mathrm{m/s}$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $20$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $20.0$.\nThus, the conduction velocity is $v = 20.0$ $\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Subtype Encoding ($s$)**\n\nThe problem defines an integer encoding, $s$, for the subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease:\n- $s = 1$ for demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth type $1$ (CMT1)\n- $s = 2$ for axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth type $2$ (CMT2)\n\nThe assignment of $s$ is to be based solely on the genetic result provided. The problem states that genetic testing reveals a pathogenic variant in the Mitofusin 2 (*MFN2*) gene.\n\nIn medical genetics and neurology, it is an established fact that pathogenic variants in the *MFN2* gene are the cause of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A). CMT2A is the most common form of CMT type 2. CMT type 2 diseases are fundamentally characterized by primary axonal degeneration, as opposed to CMT type 1 diseases, which are characterized by primary demyelination.\n\nTherefore, the *MFN2* pathogenic variant corresponds to an axonal subtype of CMT. Based on the provided encoding scheme, axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth type $2$ is encoded as $s=2$.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\n\nThe final output is required to be a two-entry row vector $\\begin{pmatrix} v  s \\end{pmatrix}$. Substituting the values determined above:\n- $v = 20.0$\n- $s = 2$\n\nThe resulting vector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 20.0  2 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} 20.0  2 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4484665"}, {"introduction": "Clinical classifications are often based on quantitative measurements, but these measurements are subject to inherent variability.
