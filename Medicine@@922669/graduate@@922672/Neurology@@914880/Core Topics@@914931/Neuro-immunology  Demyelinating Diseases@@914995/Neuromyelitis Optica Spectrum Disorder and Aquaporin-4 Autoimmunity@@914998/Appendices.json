Derivation of PPV and NPV**\n\nLet $D$ denote the event that a patient has NMOSD, and $T+$ and $T-$ denote positive and negative test results, respectively. The given parameters are:\n-   Sensitivity (Sens): $P(T+ | D) = 0.76$\n-   Specificity (Spec): $P(T- | \\neg D) = 0.99$\n-   Prevalence (pre-test probability): $P(D) = p$\n\nFrom these, we can derive:\n-   False Positive Rate: $P(T+ | \\neg D) = 1 - \\text{Spec} = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$\n-   False Negative Rate: $P(T- | D) = 1 - \\text{Sens} = 1 - 0.76 = 0.24$\n\n**Positive Predictive Value (PPV)** is the probability that a patient has the disease given a positive test result, $P(D | T+)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D | T+) = \\frac{P(T+ | D) P(D)}{P(T+)} $$\nThe total probability of a positive test, $P(T+)$, is the sum of true positives and false positives:\n$$ P(T+) = P(T+ | D)P(D) + P(T+ | \\neg D)P(\\neg D) = (\\text{Sens} \\cdot p) + ((1 - \\text{Spec}) \\cdot (1 - p)) $$\nTherefore, the closed-form expression for PPV is:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{\\text{Sens} \\cdot p}{\\text{Sens} \\cdot p + (1 - \\text{Spec})(1 - p)} $$\n\n**Negative Predictive Value (NPV)** is the probability that a patient does not have the disease given a negative test result, $P(\\neg D | T-)$. Using Bayes' theorem again:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = P(\\neg D | T-) = \\frac{P(T- | \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}{P(T-)} $$\nThe total probability of a negative test, $P(T-)$, is the sum of true negatives and false negatives:\n$$ P(T-) = P(T- | \\neg D)P(\\neg D) + P(T- | D)P(D) = (\\text{Spec} \\cdot (1 - p)) + ((1 - \\text{Sens}) \\cdot p) $$\nTherefore, the closed-form expression for NPV is:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{\\text{Spec} \\cdot (1 - p)}{\\text{Spec} \\cdot (1 - p) + (1 - \\text{Sens})p} $$\n\n**2. Calculation for Low-Prevalence Setting ($p_L = 0.05$)**\n\nUsing the derived formulas:\n$$ \\text{PPV}_{\\mathrm{L}} = \\frac{0.76 \\cdot 0.05}{0.76 \\cdot 0.05 + 0.01 \\cdot (1 - 0.05)} = \\frac{0.038}{0.038 + 0.01 \\cdot 0.95} = \\frac{0.038}{0.038 + 0.0095} = \\frac{0.038}{0.0475} = 0.8000 $$\n$$ \\text{NPV}_{\\mathrm{L}} = \\frac{0.99 \\cdot (1 - 0.05)}{0.99 \\cdot (1 - 0.05) + 0.24 \\cdot 0.05} = \\frac{0.99 \\cdot 0.95}{0.99 \\cdot 0.95 + 0.012} = \\frac{0.9405}{0.9405 + 0.012} = \\frac{0.9405}{0.9525} \\approx 0.9874 $$\n\n**3.

Interpretation**\n\nThe results show a stark contrast in the test's predictive values depending on the clinical context (pre-test probability).\n-   The **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)** increases dramatically from $0.8000$ in the low-prevalence clinic to $0.9806$ in the high-suspicion clinic. This means that a positive result in a patient with a high clinical suspicion is almost certainly a true positive. In a general clinic, a positive result still carries a 20% chance of being a false positive. This is because the absolute number of false positives (from the large non-disease population) is more significant when the disease is rare.\n-   Conversely, the **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)** is extremely high ($0.9874$) in the low-prevalence setting, effectively ruling out the disease. However, in the high-suspicion clinic, the NPV drops to $0.8609$. This implies a nearly 14% chance that a negative result is a false negative, meaning the test is less reliable for ruling out NMOSD in a patient who has a high clinical probability of the disease. This is because the higher number of true positives increases the absolute number of false negatives.\n\nThis exercise highlights the critical principle that a diagnostic test's utility cannot be judged by its sensitivity and specificity alone; it must be interpreted in the context of the pre-test probability.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.8000 & 0.9874 & 0.9806 & 0.8609 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4506841"}, {"introduction": "Moving from diagnosis to the molecular underpinnings of disease, this practice examines the initial pathogenic event in NMOSD.
