The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) metadata report in-plane pixel spacing of $s_{x} = 0.45$ millimeters per pixel (left–right, transverse axis) and $s_{y} = 0.40$ millimeters per pixel (anterior–posterior axis). At four contiguous axial slices spanning the maximal compression, a trained rater uses a digital caliper to measure the spinal cord’s anteroposterior diameter ($n_{AP}$, in pixels along the $y$ axis) and transverse diameter ($n_{LAT}$, in pixels along the $x$ axis) at the cord’s centroid as follows: slice $A$: $n_{AP}=12$, $n_{LAT}=26$; slice $B$: $n_{AP}=11$, $n_{LAT}=27$; slice $C$: $n_{AP}=9$, $n_{LAT}=28$; slice $D$: $n_{AP}=10$, $n_{LAT}=25$.\n\nUsing the definition that the cord compression ratio at the maximally compressed level is the dimensionless ratio of the smallest anteroposterior diameter to the largest transverse diameter measured across the set of axial images at that level, compute this ratio by converting pixel counts to physical diameters before forming the ratio.

The data provided are consistent and realistic for a clinical neuroimaging scenario.\n\nThe objective is to compute the spinal cord compression ratio and discuss its clinical implications based on the given data.\n\nFirst, we must convert the pixel-based measurements into physical diameters in millimeters.

This represents a significant degree of geometric distortion. The problem states a qualitative relationship: greater geometric compression corresponds to lower modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) scores. The mJOA categories given are severe ($mJOA \\leq 11$), moderate ($mJOA \\in [12,14]$), and mild ($mJOA \\in [15,17]$). Given the substantial geometric compression indicated by the ratio $R_c \\approx 0.2857$, it is most probable that the patient's clinical status corresponds to the severe myelopathy category ($mJOA \\leq 11$).

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to calculate the posterior probability of true compressive myelopathy ($C$) given a positive MRI result ($+$), which is denoted as $P(C \\mid +)$.\n\nBy the definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$P(C \\mid +) = \\frac{P(C \\cap +)}{P(+)}$$\n\nThe event $C$ represents true compressive myelopathy, which is caused by either spondylosis ($S$) or a tumor ($T$). Since a patient cannot simultaneously have both as the primary etiology in this model, the events $S$ and $T$ are mutually exclusive. Therefore, $C = S \\cup T$.\n\nWe can now express the numerator, $P(C \\cap +)$, by substituting the definition of $C$:\n$$P(C \\cap +) = P((S \\cup T) \\cap +)$$\nUsing the distributive property of set operations, this becomes:\n$$P((S \\cap +) \\cup (T \\cap +))$$\nBecause $S$ and $T$ are mutually exclusive, the events $(S \\cap +)$ and $(T \\cap +)$ are also mutually exclusive. Thus, the probability of their union is the sum of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(C \\cap +) = P(S \\cap +) + P(T \\cap +)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A \\mid B)P(B)$, we can rewrite the terms:\n$$P(C \\cap +) = P(+ \\mid S)P(S) + P(+ \\mid T)P(T)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(C \\cap +) = (0.90)(0.35) + (0.96)(0.10)$$\n$$P(C \\cap +) = 0.315 + 0.096 = 0.411$$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, $P(+)$, which is the total probability of a positive MRI result. Since the set of events $\\{S, T, N\\}$ forms a partition of the sample space, we can apply the law of total probability:\n$$P(+) = P(+ \\mid S)P(S) + P(+ \\mid T)P(T) + P(+ \\mid N)P(N)$$\nThe first two terms are the same as in the calculation for the numerator. We just need to add the third term.\n$$P(+) = (0.411) + P(+ \\mid N)P(N)$$\nWe are given $P(-\\mid N) = 0.93$, so $P(+\\mid N) = 1 - P(-\\mid N) = 1 - 0.93 = 0.07$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$P(+) = 0.411 + (0.07)(0.55)$$\n$$P(+) = 0.411 + 0.0385 = 0.4495$$\n\nFinally, we can compute the desired posterior probability $P(C \\mid +)$:\n$$P(C \\mid +) = \\frac{P(C \\cap +)}{P(+)} = \\frac{0.411}{0.4495}$$\n$$P(C \\mid +) \\approx 0.9143492769744...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(C \\mid +) \\approx 0.9143$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9143}$$", "id": "4470670"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis of compressive myelopathy due to a tumor is established, the critical management question often revolves around spinal stability.
