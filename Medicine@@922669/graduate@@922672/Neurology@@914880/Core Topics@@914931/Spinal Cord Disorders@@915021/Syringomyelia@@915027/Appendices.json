At the craniocaudal level where the syrinx is maximal, the anterior–posterior syrinx diameter is measured as $5$ millimeters and the corresponding whole spinal cord anterior–posterior diameter (outer cord to outer cord at the same axial slice) is $10$ millimeters. Using only the definition that a ratio is a dimensionless quotient formed by dividing one like-dimension linear measure by another like-dimension linear measure, first specify what the syrinx-to-cord ratio is intended to quantify and how it must be constructed from the given diameters. Then compute this ratio for the measurements provided. For clinical context, established categorization commonly used in syringomyelia stratifies the ratio as small if less than $0.25$, intermediate if between $0.25$ and $0.50$, and large if greater than $0.50$, with higher risk of progression generally associated with values greater than $0.50$ when longitudinally observed.
