The provided values for temperature and ionic concentrations are physiologically realistic. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary information to determine the reversal potential and asks for a specific, calculable quantity. The language is objective and precise.\n\nThe central point of the problem revolves around the distinction between ionic permeability, a kinetic property, and the reversal potential, a thermodynamic property. The problem states that permeability is altered, while the factors determining the thermodynamic equilibrium (concentrations, temperature, charge) are not. This setup is self-consistent and tests a crucial concept in biophysics. The problem is not flawed; it is a valid and well-formulated scientific question.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires deriving the expression for the sodium reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, from the first principle that at equilibrium, the electrochemical potential of an ion is equal on both sides of the membrane.\n\nThe electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_{S}$, for an ionic species $S$ is given by the sum of its chemical potential and its electrical potential energy:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_{S} = \\mu_{S}^{0} + RT \\ln(a_S) + zFV\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_{S}^{0}$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $a_S$ is the chemical activity of the species (approximated by its concentration $[S]$), $z$ is the valence of the ion, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $V$ is the electrical potential of the compartment.\n\nAt the reversal potential, the net flow of sodium ions is zero. This occurs when the electrochemical potential for sodium inside the cell, $\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}, i}$, is equal to the electrochemical potential for sodium outside the cell, $\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}, o}$.\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}, i} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}, o}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for electrochemical potential for both compartments:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{0} + RT \\ln([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i}) + zFV_{i} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{0} + RT \\ln([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o}) + zFV_{o}\n$$\nThe standard chemical potential term, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{0}$, is identical on both sides and cancels out. The valence for sodium is $z=+1$.\n$$\nRT \\ln([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i}) + FV_{i} = RT \\ln([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o}) + FV_{o}\n$$\nWe are interested in the potential difference across the membrane, which is defined as the membrane potential, $V_m = V_i - V_o$. The reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$, is the specific membrane potential at which this equilibrium occurs. Rearranging the equation to solve for $V_i - V_o$:\n$$\nF(V_i - V_o) = RT \\ln([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o}) - RT \\ln([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i})\n$$\n$$\nF E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = RT \\left( \\ln([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o}) - \\ln([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i}) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we combine the terms:\n$$\nF E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o}}{[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i}} \\right)\n$$\nSolving for the reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ (which for sodium is denoted $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$), we obtain the Nernst equation:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o}}{[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i}} \\right)\n$$\nThis derivation fulfills the first part of the problem.\n\nNow, we must determine the change in this reversal potential due to the mutation. The Nernst equation shows that the reversal potential is a function of the temperature $T$, ion concentrations $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o}$ and $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i}$, and the ion's valence $z$. $R$ and $F$ are fundamental physical constants.\n\nThe problem states that the mutation:\n1.  Reduces sodium permeability by a factor of $0.60$.\n2.  Does **not** alter ion selectivity.\n3.  Does **not** alter the valence of the charge carrier ($z=+1$).\n4.  Does **not** alter the ionic concentrations ($[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o} = 145$ mM, $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i} = 12$ mM).\n5.  The temperature remains constant ($T = 310$ K).\n\nIonic permeability, denoted $P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, is a kinetic parameter that quantifies the rate at which ions can pass through the channel. It is a factor in the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) *current* equation, which describes the magnitude of the ionic current as a function of membrane voltage. However, permeability does not appear in the Nernst equation. The Nernst potential is a thermodynamic quantity representing the equilibrium state, which is independent of the rate at which that equilibrium is reached.\n\nSince the reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ depends only on $T$, $z$, $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o}$, and $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i}$, and none of these parameters are affected by the mutation, the reversal potential of the mutant channel, $E_{\\mathrm{mutant}}$, is identical to that of the wild-type channel, $E_{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln \\left( \\frac{145}{12} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{mutant}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln \\left( \\frac{145}{12} \\right)\n$$\nThe change in the reversal potential, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{Na}} = E_{\\mathrm{mutant}} - E_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 0\n$$\nThe reduction in permeability will decrease the magnitude of the sodium current for any given driving force ($V_m - E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$), but it will not shift the voltage at which the net current becomes zero. Therefore, the expected change in the channel's reversal potential is $0$ mV.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "4507242"}, {"introduction": "While the reversal potential sets the thermodynamic boundaries for ion flow, the rate of neuronal firing is governed by the kinetics of channel gating.
