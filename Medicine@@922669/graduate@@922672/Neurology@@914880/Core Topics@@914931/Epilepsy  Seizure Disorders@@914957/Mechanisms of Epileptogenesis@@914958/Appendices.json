It is scientifically grounded in the principles of neurophysiology and biophysics, well-posed with all necessary parameters and assumptions provided, and formulated with objective, unambiguous language. The problem is a standard exercise in quantitative cellular neurophysiology and does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the potassium equilibrium potential, $E_K$, also known as the Nernst potential for potassium. At electrochemical equilibrium, the net flux of an ion across the membrane is zero. This occurs when the chemical potential gradient is exactly balanced by the electrical potential gradient. The electrochemical potential, $\\mu_i$, for an ion species $i$ with valence $z_i$ and concentration $[i]$ is given by:\n$$ \\mu_i = \\mu_i^0 + RT \\ln[i] + z_i F V $$\nwhere $\\mu_i^0$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $F$ is Faraday's constant, and $V$ is the electrical potential.\n\nFor equilibrium to hold for potassium ions ($K^{+}$), the electrochemical potential inside the neuron must equal the electrochemical potential outside:\n$$ \\mu_{K,in} = \\mu_{K,out} $$\n$$ \\mu_K^0 + RT \\ln[K^{+}]_{in} + z_K F V_{in} = \\mu_K^0 + RT \\ln[K^{+}]_{out} + z_K F V_{out} $$\nAssuming the standard potential $\\mu_K^0$ is the same in both compartments, it cancels out. Rearranging the terms to solve for the potential difference across the membrane, $V_m = V_{in} - V_{out}$, which is defined as the equilibrium potential $E_K$:\n$$ z_K F (V_{in} - V_{out}) = RT \\ln[K^{+}]_{out} - RT \\ln[K^{+}]_{in} $$\n$$ E_K = V_{in} - V_{out} = \\frac{RT}{z_K F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{out}}{[K^{+}]_{in}}\\right) $$\nThis is the Nernst equation.\n\nWe now compute the value of $E_K$ before and after the change in extracellular potassium concentration. The given values are:\n$R = 8.314 \\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}$\n$T = 310 \\ \\text{K}$\n$F = 96485 \\ \\text{C mol}^{-1}$\n$z_K = +1$\n$[K^{+}]_{in} = 140 \\ \\text{mM}$\n\nThe pre-factor $\\frac{RT}{z_K F}$ is:\n$$ \\frac{RT}{z_K F} = \\frac{(8.314 \\ \\text{J mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1})(310 \\ \\text{K})}{(1)(96485 \\ \\text{C mol}^{-1})} \\approx 0.02671 \\ \\text{J C}^{-1} = 0.02671 \\ \\text{V} = 26.71 \\ \\text{mV} $$\n\nBefore the change (state 1): $[K^{+}]_{out,1} = 3 \\ \\text{mM}$.\n$$ E_{K,1} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{140}\\right) \\approx (26.71 \\ \\text{mV}) \\ln(0.02143) \\approx (26.71 \\ \\text{mV})(-3.842) \\approx -102.6 \\ \\text{mV} $$\n\nAfter the change (state 2): $[K^{+}]_{out,2} = 8 \\ \\text{mM}$.\n$$ E_{K,2} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{8}{140}\\right) \\approx (26.71 \\ \\text{mV}) \\ln(0.05714) \\approx (26.71 \\ \\text{mV})(-2.862) \\approx -76.45 \\ \\text{mV} $$\n\nSecond, we derive the expression for the resting membrane potential, $V_{rest}$. At rest, the net ionic current across the membrane is zero. This is an application of Kirchhoff's current law. The total current $I_{net}$ is the sum of the individual leak currents for potassium ($I_K$), sodium ($I_{Na}$), and chloride ($I_{Cl}$):\n$$ I_{net} = I_K + I_{Na} + I_{Cl} = 0 $$\nUsing the provided Ohm's law form for ionic currents, $I_i = g_i(V_m - E_i)$, where $g_i$ is the leak conductance and $E_i$ is the reversal (Nernst) potential for ion $i$:\n$$ g_K(V_{rest} - E_K) + g_{Na}(V_{rest} - E_{Na}) + g_{Cl}(V_{rest} - E_{Cl}) = 0 $$\nWe solve this linear equation for $V_{rest}$:\n$$ V_{rest}(g_K + g_{Na} + g_{Cl}) = g_K E_K + g_{Na} E_{Na} + g_{Cl} E_{Cl} $$\n$$ V_{rest} = \\frac{g_K E_K + g_{Na} E_{Na} + g_{Cl} E_{Cl}}{g_K + g_{Na} + g_{Cl}} $$\nThis equation, often termed the chord conductance equation, shows that the resting potential is a weighted average of the reversal potentials, where the weighting factors are the respective ionic conductances.\n\nThird, we estimate the change in $V_{rest}$ due to the change in $E_K$. We are given the leak conductance ratio $g_K:g_{Na}:g_{Cl} = 5:1:1$. Let $g_{Na} = g_{Cl} = g_0$ for some conductance unit $g_0$. Then $g_K = 5g_0$. The total conductance is $g_{total} = g_K + g_{Na} + g_{Cl} = 5g_0 + g_0 + g_0 = 7g_0$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $V_{rest}$:\n$$ V_{rest} = \\frac{(5g_0) E_K + (g_0) E_{Na} + (g_0) E_{Cl}}{7g_0} = \\frac{5E_K + E_{Na} + E_{Cl}}{7} $$\nThe initial resting potential, $V_{rest,1}$, corresponds to $E_K = E_{K,1}$:\n$$ V_{rest,1} = \\frac{5E_{K,1} + E_{Na} + E_{Cl}}{7} $$\nThe final resting potential, $V_{rest,2}$, corresponds to $E_K = E_{K,2}$:\n$$ V_{rest,2} = \\frac{5E_{K,2} + E_{Na} + E_{Cl}}{7} $$\nThe change in resting potential, $\\Delta V_{rest}$, is the difference $V_{rest,2} - V_{rest,1}$. The problem assumes $E_{Na}$ and $E_{Cl}$ remain constant.\n$$ \\Delta V_{rest} = V_{rest,2} - V_{rest,1} = \\left(\\frac{5E_{K,2} + E_{Na} + E_{Cl}}{7}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{5E_{K,1} + E_{Na} + E_{Cl}}{7}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta V_{rest} = \\frac{5E_{K,2} - 5E_{K,1}}{7} = \\frac{5}{7}(E_{K,2} - E_{K,1}) $$\nThe change depends only on the change in the potassium reversal potential, $\\Delta E_K = E_{K,2} - E_{K,1}$. We can calculate this change directly:\n$$ \\Delta E_K = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{out,2}}{[K^{+}]_{in}}\\right) - \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{out,1}}{[K^{+}]_{in}}\\right) $$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$ \\Delta E_K = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{out,2}/[K^{+}]_{in}}{[K^{+}]_{out,1}/[K^{+}]_{in}}\\right) = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{out,2}}{[K^{+}]_{out,1}}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\Delta E_K = \\frac{(8.314)(310)}{(1)(96485)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{8}{3}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta E_K \\approx (0.026712 \\ \\text{V}) \\ln(2.666...) \\approx (0.026712 \\ \\text{V})(0.98083) \\approx 0.026201 \\ \\text{V} = 26.201 \\ \\text{mV} $$\nNow we can compute the change in the resting membrane potential:\n$$ \\Delta V_{rest} = \\frac{5}{7} \\Delta E_K \\approx \\frac{5}{7} (26.201 \\ \\text{mV}) \\approx 0.71428 \\times 26.201 \\ \\text{mV} \\approx 18.715 \\ \\text{mV} $$\nThe problem asks for the depolarization, which is a positive change in membrane potential (movement toward less negative values).
