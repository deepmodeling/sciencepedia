Consider the opening transition of a voltage-gated sodium channel modeled as a single-step, first-order kinetic process with a forward rate constant $k(T)$ that depends on absolute temperature. Empirically, over modest temperature ranges relevant to fever, many ion channel kinetic rates obey a temperature coefficient relation in which the temperature coefficient $Q_{10}$ is defined by\n$$Q_{10}=\\frac{k(T+10)}{k(T)},$$\nand can be treated as approximately constant across small temperature intervals.\n\nStarting from the above definition and the general principle that thermally activated rates follow Arrhenius-type temperature dependence, derive an expression for the fold-change $\\frac{k(T+\\Delta T)}{k(T)}$ for arbitrary $\\Delta T$ when $Q_{10}$ is constant over the interval $\\left[T, T+\\Delta T\\right]$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical kinetics (Arrhenius equation) and neurophysiology (ion channel function, febrile seizures). The use of the $Q_{10}$ temperature coefficient is a standard and appropriate simplifying model in this biological context. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language.\n\nThe problem asks for two parts: first, to derive a general expression for the fold-change in a rate constant, and second, to calculate this change for specific values.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the fold-change expression.\n\nThe temperature dependence of thermally activated processes, such as the conformational changes in an ion channel, is fundamentally described by the Arrhenius equation:\n$$k(T) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right)$$\nwhere $k(T)$ is the rate constant, $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_a$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem introduces the $Q_{10}$ temperature coefficient, defined as the factor by which the rate increases for a $10^\\circ\\text{C}$ (or $10\\ \\mathrm{K}$) rise in temperature:\n$$Q_{10} = \\frac{k(T+10)}{k(T)}$$\nThe problem states that $Q_{10}$ can be treated as approximately constant over the relevant temperature range. This condition implies a specific functional form for $k(T)$. If the ratio $\\frac{k(T+10)}{k(T)}$ is a constant for any temperature $T$ in the interval, this defines a geometric progression, which corresponds to an exponential function.\n\nLet us assume the functional form for $k(T)$ is $k(T) = C \\cdot b^T$, where $T$ is the temperature in degrees Celsius, and $C$ and $b$ are constants. We can show this is consistent with the constant $Q_{10}$ definition:\n$$\\frac{k(T+10)}{k(T)} = \\frac{C \\cdot b^{T+10}}{C \\cdot b^{T}} = b^{10}$$\nFrom the definition of $Q_{10}$, we must have $b^{10} = Q_{10}$, which implies $b = (Q_{10})^{1/10}$.\nSubstituting this back into our assumed form for $k(T)$, we get:\n$$k(T) = C \\cdot \\left((Q_{10})^{1/10}\\right)^T = C \\cdot (Q_{10})^{T/10}$$\nThis exponential model is a useful local approximation of the more fundamental Arrhenius relationship.\n\nNow we can derive the expression for the fold-change, $\\frac{k(T+\\Delta T)}{k(T)}$, for an arbitrary temperature change $\\Delta T$.\nUsing the functional form derived above:\n$$\\frac{k(T+\\Delta T)}{k(T)} = \\frac{C \\cdot (Q_{10})^{(T+\\Delta T)/10}}{C \\cdot (Q_{10})^{T/10}}$$\nThe constant $C$ cancels out. Using the properties of exponents ($a^{x-y} = a^x/a^y$):\n$$\\frac{k(T+\\Delta T)}{k(T)} = (Q_{10})^{\\frac{T+\\Delta T}{10} - \\frac{T}{10}} = (Q_{10})^{\\frac{T+\\Delta T - T}{10}}$$\nThis simplifies to the general expression for the fold-change:\n$$\\frac{k(T+\\Delta T)}{k(T)} = (Q_{10})^{\\frac{\\Delta T}{10}}$$\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the multiplicative change.\n\nWe are given the following values:\nThe initial temperature is $T_1 = 37^\\circ\\text{C}$.\nThe final temperature is $T_2 = 39^\\circ\\text{C}$.\nThe temperature change is $\\Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = 39^\\circ\\text{C} - 37^\\circ\\text{C} = 2^\\circ\\text{C}$.\nThe temperature coefficient is $Q_{10} = 2.5$.\n\nWe use the derived formula to calculate the multiplicative change (fold-change) in the sodium channel opening rate constant.\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = (Q_{10})^{\\frac{\\Delta T}{10}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = (2.5)^{\\frac{2}{10}} = (2.5)^{0.2}$$\nThis is equivalent to the fifth root of $2.5$:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\sqrt[5]{2.5}$$\nWe compute the numerical value:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} \\approx 1.2011145...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1.201$. The fifth digit is $1$, so we round down.\nThe calculated multiplicative change in the rate constant is $1.201$.
