We proceed from first principles.\n\nFirst, recall the mass balance definition for a one-compartment model with apparent distribution volume. The amount of drug in the body $A$ is related to the plasma concentration $C$ by\n$$\nA = C \\cdot V_{d,\\text{total}},\n$$\nwhere $V_{d,\\text{total}}$ is the total apparent Volume of Distribution. For a patient of body mass $M$ with a per-kilogram apparent Volume of Distribution $V_{d}$, we have\n$$\nV_{d,\\text{total}} = V_{d} \\cdot M.\n$$\n\nTo achieve a target concentration $C_{\\text{target}}$ immediately after distribution with IV administration (bioavailability equal to $1$ and instantaneous distribution relative to infusion timescale), the loading dose $LD$ must supply an amount equal to the target amount in the body:\n$$\nLD = A_{\\text{target}} = C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot V_{d,\\text{total}} = C_{\\text{target}} \\cdot V_{d} \\cdot M.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $C_{\\text{target}} = 15$ mg/L, $V_{d} = 0.7$ L/kg, and $M = 70$ kg, we compute\n$$\nV_{d,\\text{total}} = 0.7 \\times 70 = 49 \\text{ L},\n$$\nand thus\n$$\nLD = 15 \\times 49 = 735 \\text{ mg}.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $735$ mg.\n\nSecond, we determine the minimal infusion duration to reach $C_{\\text{target}}$ at the maximum allowed infusion rate. Let the zero-order IV infusion rate be $R$ (mg/min). The governing mass balance during infusion is\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = R - \\text{(elimination term)}.\n$$\nFor phenytoin, elimination near therapeutic concentrations is capacity-limited (Michaelis–Menten), but the problem stipulates that elimination during the short infusion is negligible compared with input. This is justified by a timescale separation argument: the characteristic elimination timescale (even under nonlinear kinetics) is on the order of hours, whereas the infusion time at $R = 50$ mg/min for a dose on the order of hundreds of mg is on the order of minutes. Therefore, during infusion we approximate\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} \\approx R,\n$$\nso the time to accumulate the loading amount is simply\n$$\nt_{\\text{inf}} \\approx \\frac{LD}{R}.\n$$\nUsing $LD = 735$ mg and $R = 50$ mg/min, we have\n$$\nt_{\\text{inf}} \\approx \\frac{735}{50} = 14.7 \\text{ min}.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $14.7$ minutes.\n\nUnder the “no maintenance” condition, once the infusion stops, the concentration will subsequently decline due to elimination; however, the question asks for the time needed to reach $C_{\\text{target}}$, which, under the negligible-elimination approximation during infusion, coincides with the infusion duration computed above.\n\nTherefore, the two requested quantities, rounded to three significant figures, are:\n- Loading dose: $735$ mg.\n- Infusion time: $14.7$ minutes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}735 & 14.7\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4448932"}, {"introduction": "Transitioning from acute intervention to long-term management requires a different pharmacokinetic approach focused on maintaining a stable drug level.

The fundamental principle is that the pharmacological effect of a drug is proportional to its unbound (free) concentration, not its total concentration.

The Sheiner–Tozer equation is an empirically derived formula used in clinical practice to adjust the measured total concentration of phenytoin to a value that reflects the equivalent total concentration in a patient with normal albumin levels, thereby providing the same free drug concentration.\n\nThe problem states that the patient has clinically normal renal function.
