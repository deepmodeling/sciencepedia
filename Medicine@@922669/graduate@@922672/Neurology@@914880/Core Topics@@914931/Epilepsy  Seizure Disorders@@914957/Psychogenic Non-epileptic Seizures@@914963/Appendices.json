Let $T$ be the event that the screening questionnaire is positive, and let $T^c$ be the event that the screen is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following quantities:\n1.  The pretest prevalence of PNES, which is the prior probability of the condition: $P(D) = 0.30$.\n2.

Derivation and Calculation of Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$)**\n\nThe $PPV$ is defined as the posterior probability of having PNES given a positive screen, $P(D \\mid T)$. We use Bayes' theorem to express this:\n$$PPV = P(D \\mid T) = \\frac{P(T \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, is the overall probability of a positive screen. It can be found using the law of total probability, conditioning on the presence or absence of PNES:\n$$P(T) = P(T \\mid D) P(D) + P(T \\mid D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $PPV$ yields the general formula in terms of the given and derived quantities:\n$$PPV = \\frac{P(T \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T \\mid D) P(D) + P(T \\mid D^c) P(D^c)}$$\nThis formula expresses $PPV$ as a function of sensitivity ($P(T \\mid D)$), prevalence ($P(D)$), and the false positive rate ($P(T \\mid D^c) = 1 - \\text{specificity}$).\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for the given cohort:\n$$P(T) = (0.80)(0.30) + (0.10)(0.70) = 0.24 + 0.07 = 0.31$$\nUsing this, we can calculate the $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{P(T \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T)} = \\frac{(0.80)(0.30)}{0.31} = \\frac{0.24}{0.31} \\approx 0.7741935...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $PPV = 0.7742$.\n\n**2. Derivation and Calculation of Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$)**\n\nThe $NPV$ is defined as the posterior probability of not having PNES given a negative screen, $P(D^c \\mid T^c)$. We again use Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c \\mid T^c) = \\frac{P(T^c \\mid D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^c)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^c)$, is the overall probability of a negative screen. It can be found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^c) = P(T^c \\mid D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^c \\mid D) P(D)$$\n(As a check, $P(T^c)$ must equal $1 - P(T) = 1 - 0.31 = 0.69$).\nSubstituting this into the expression for $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{P(T^c \\mid D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^c \\mid D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^c \\mid D) P(D)}$$\nThis formula expresses $NPV$ as a function of specificity ($P(T^c \\mid D^c)$), prevalence ($P(D)$), and the false negative rate ($P(T^c \\mid D) = 1 - \\text{sensitivity}$).\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$P(T^c) = (0.90)(0.70) + (0.20)(0.30) = 0.63 + 0.06 = 0.69$$\nThis confirms our earlier check. Using this, we calculate the $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{P(T^c \\mid D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^c)} = \\frac{(0.90)(0.70)}{0.69} = \\frac{0.63}{0.69} \\approx 0.9130434...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $NPV = 0.9130$.\n\nThe final calculated values are a $PPV$ of $0.7742$ and an $NPV$ of $0.9130$.

The contextual information, such as event duration, while not used in the calculation, serves to create a realistic clinical vignette.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be formulated based on the provided data and principles.\n\n### Solution Formulation\n\nLet $D$ represent the diagnosis of PNES, and $D^c$ represent the alternative diagnosis of an epileptic seizure. Let $F_1$ be the observation of asynchronous limb movements and $F_2$ be the observation of a preserved corneal reflex.\n\nThe given information is:\n- The pretest probability of PNES: $P(D) = 0.25$.\n- The likelihood ratio for feature $F_1$: $LR_1 = \\frac{P(F_1|D)}{P(F_1|D^c)} = 4.0$.\n- The likelihood ratio for feature $F_2$: $LR_2 = \\frac{P(F_2|D)}{P(F_2|D^c)} = 3.0$.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the combined likelihood ratio ($LR_{\\text{combined}}$) and the posterior probability of PNES ($P(D|F_1, F_2)$).\n\n**1. Combined Likelihood Ratio ($LR_{\\text{combined}}$)**\n\nThe likelihood ratio for observing both features $F_1$ and $F_2$ is defined as:\n$$LR_{\\text{combined}} = \\frac{P(F_1 \\land F_2 | D)}{P(F_1 \\land F_2 | D^c)}$$\nThe problem states that the features are conditionally independent given the diagnosis. This means that $P(F_1 \\land F_2 | D) = P(F_1|D)P(F_2|D)$ and $P(F_1 \\land F_2 | D^c) = P(F_1|D^c)P(F_2|D^c)$.\nSubstituting these into the equation for $LR_{\\text{combined}}$:\n$$LR_{\\text{combined}} = \\frac{P(F_1|D)P(F_2|D)}{P(F_1|D^c)P(F_2|D^c)} = \\left(\\frac{P(F_1|D)}{P(F_1|D^c)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(F_2|D)}{P(F_2|D^c)}\\right)$$\nThis shows that for conditionally independent features, the combined likelihood ratio is the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$LR_{\\text{combined}} = LR_1 \\times LR_2$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$LR_{\\text{combined}} = 4.0 \\times 3.0 = 12.0$$\n\n**2. Posterior Probability of PNES ($P(D|F_1, F_2)$)**\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem in its odds form:\n$$\\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Pretest Odds} \\times \\text{Likelihood Ratio}$$\nFirst, we calculate the pretest odds of PNES, denoted as $O(D)$. The odds of an event are the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring.\nThe pretest probability of PNES is $P(D) = 0.25$.\nThe probability of not having PNES (i.e., having an epileptic seizure) is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\nThe pretest odds are:\n$$O(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} = \\frac{0.25}{0.75} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nNext, we calculate the posterior odds of PNES after observing both features, $O(D|F_1, F_2)$, using the pretest odds and the combined likelihood ratio:\n$$O(D|F_1, F_2) = O(D) \\times LR_{\\text{combined}}$$\n$$O(D|F_1, F_2) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 12.0 = 4.0$$\nFinally, we convert the posterior odds back to a probability. The relationship between probability $P$ and odds $O$ is $P = \\frac{O}{1+O}$.\nThe posterior probability of PNES is:\n$$P(D|F_1, F_2) = \\frac{O(D|F_1, F_2)}{1 + O(D|F_1, F_2)}$$\n$$P(D|F_1, F_2) = \\frac{4.0}{1 + 4.0} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8$$\n\nThe combined likelihood ratio is $12.0$, and the posterior probability of PNES is $0.8$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n12.0 & 0.8\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4519918"}, {"introduction": "Ultimately, the diagnosis of PNES relies on the expert integration of clinical observation with electrophysiological data, a process that transcends simple calculations.

It is scientifically sound, complete, unambiguous, and allows for a rigorous, principle-based solution.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task requires two main steps: first, to classify the captured events using the provided definition of PNES, and second, to identify a finding that would falsify this classification, proving the event is an epileptic seizure.\n\n**Part 1: Classification of the Events**\n\nI will apply the two-pronged definition of PNES to the given data.\n\n1.  **\"...lacks electrophysiological evidence of ictal neuronal hypersynchrony on adequate simultaneous EEG...\"**\n    The problem states that the ictal EEG, recorded with an adequate setup (21 electrodes, impedances <5 k$\\Omega$, 256 Hz sampling), showed \"no evolution or emergence of rhythmic, stereotyped, or spatiotemporally consistent epileptiform activity time-locked to the clinical events.\" A stable posterior dominant rhythm at 10 Hz is a normal finding in an awake, relaxed adult with eyes closed. The presence of muscle and movement artifact is expected given the clinical description of \"thrashing\", but the crucial finding is the *absence* of an underlying electrographic seizure pattern. This directly satisfies the first criterion for PNES.\n\n2.  **\"...and exhibits semiology incompatible with epileptic seizures.\"**\n    I will analyze the clinical features (semiology) of the event:\n    -   **Duration and Motor Pattern:** A 6-minute duration with \"variable, asynchronous thrashing\" and \"fluctuating intensity\" is highly atypical for a generalized motor epileptic seizure, which is typically stereotyped, rhythmic, and much shorter (e.g., 1-2 minutes).\n    -   **Eye Closure:** \"Eyes are forcibly closed throughout the episode, with resistance to passive opening.\" This is a classic sign strongly suggestive of PNES. In contrast, the eyes are typically open during a generalized tonic-clonic epileptic seizure.\n    -   **Preserved Awareness:** The individual \"intermittently responds to name calling with nonverbal gestures.\" Preserved awareness during a bilateral motor event of this nature is virtually impossible in an epileptic seizure and is a pathognomonic feature of PNES. A generalized or secondarily generalized epileptic seizure would cause profound impairment of consciousness.\n    -   **Post-event State:** \"Recovery is prompt: within 1 minute...alert and oriented, with no confusion, headache, or focal neurological deficit.\" This rapid and complete recovery contrasts sharply with the typical postictal state following a generalized motor seizure, which involves a period of confusion, lethargy, and sometimes headache lasting many minutes to hours.\n    -   **Supportive Data:** A normal serum lactate level 15 minutes post-event further argues against a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, which typically causes lactic acidosis due to intense, widespread muscle contraction.\n\nCombining these points, the semiology is not merely \"incompatible with\" but is highly characteristic of PNES. Both criteria in the provided definition are unequivocally met.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 1:** The events meet the criteria for Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES).\n\n**Part 2: Identification of a Falsifying Observation**\n\nTo falsify the PNES diagnosis, one must find evidence that proves the event *is* an epileptic seizure according to its fundamental definition: \"a transient clinical event arising from abnormal, excessive, and synchronous neuronal activity.\"\n\nThe most direct and irrefutable evidence of such neuronal activity is its electrographic correlate on an EEG. The diagnosis of PNES in this case is predicated on the *absence* of this electrographic evidence. Therefore, the definitive falsification would be the *presence* of this evidence during a typical clinical event.\n\nThis evidence would manifest on the EEG as a clear \"ictal pattern,\" which is characterized by:\n-   **Rhythmic activity:** A train of waves with a relatively constant morphology and interval.\n-   **Evolution:** A change in the frequency, amplitude, or spatial distribution of the rhythmic activity over time.\n-   **Time-locking:** The onset and offset of the electrographic pattern must be clearly correlated with the onset and offset of the clinical manifestations.\n-   **Epileptiform discharges:** The pattern may consist of spikes, sharp waves, or spike-and-wave complexes.\n\nThus, the single observation that would falsify the PNES classification and establish a diagnosis of an epileptic seizure is the demonstration of a time-locked, evolving ictal rhythm or epileptiform discharges on a simultaneous EEG during a typical episode. While the initial EEG was negative, this does not preclude the possibility that a future, perhaps technically superior or simply fortuitous, recording could capture such a pattern, which would overwrite the previous diagnosis.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The events meet PNES criteria; falsified by demonstration of a time-locked, evolving ictal rhythm or epileptiform discharges on simultaneous scalp EEG during a typical episode.**\n-   **Classification:** \"The events meet PNES criteria.\" This aligns perfectly with my analysis.\n-   **Falsification:** The proposed falsifier is the definitive electrographic evidence of an epileptic seizure. This is the gold standard for diagnosis and directly contradicts the EEG-based criterion for PNES. This would, by first principles, prove the event was epileptic.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. The events meet PNES criteria; falsified by an elevated post-event serum prolactin alone.**\n-   **Classification:** \"The events meet PNES criteria.\" This part is correct.\n-   **Falsification:** An elevated post-event serum prolactin can be a supportive marker for generalized tonic-clonic or some focal seizures, but it has poor sensitivity and specificity. It is not always elevated after true epileptic seizures and can be elevated in other conditions. It is an indirect hormonal marker, not a direct measure of neuronal activity as required by the first-principles definition. An elevated prolactin \"alone,\" in the face of overwhelming semiological and EEG evidence for PNES, would not be sufficient to falsify the diagnosis.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The events do not meet PNES criteria; falsified by reproduction of a similar episode through suggestion during provocative induction.**\n-   **Classification:** \"The events do not meet PNES criteria.\" This is incorrect. As demonstrated, the events are a classic example of PNES.\n-   **Falsification:** \"reproduction of a similar episode through suggestion\" is a technique used to *support* or *confirm* a diagnosis of PNES, not falsify it. If suggestion can trigger a typical event, it strengthens the case for a psychogenic origin. It provides no evidence for an epileptic etiology.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The events meet PNES criteria; falsified by lack of response to therapeutic doses of antiseizure medications over $3$ months.**\n-   **Classification:** \"The events meet PNES criteria.\" This part is correct.\n-   **Falsification:** \"lack of response to therapeutic doses of antiseizure medications\" is an *expected feature* of PNES, as these events do not have an epileptic basis. Therefore, this observation would *support* or *confirm* the diagnosis of PNES, not falsify it. The logic presented is inverted.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4519939"}]}
