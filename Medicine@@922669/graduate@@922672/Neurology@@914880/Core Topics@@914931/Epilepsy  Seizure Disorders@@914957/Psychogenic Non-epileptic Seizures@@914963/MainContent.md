## Introduction
Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures (PNES) represent one of the most common and challenging differential diagnoses in neurology, frequently mimicking epileptic seizures and leading to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. This article addresses the critical knowledge gap for clinicians by providing a comprehensive, integrated framework for understanding, diagnosing, and managing this complex neuropsychiatric condition. The journey begins in the first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, where we will establish the fundamental definitions, diagnostic criteria, and neurobiological models that underpin PNES. Building on this foundation, the second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, will explore the practical application of this knowledge in diverse clinical settings and its intersection with fields like law, ethics, and health economics. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** chapter will offer interactive scenarios to hone your diagnostic reasoning skills, translating theoretical knowledge into clinical expertise. This structured approach will equip you with the confidence and competence to navigate the multifaceted world of PNES.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter elucidates the fundamental principles and mechanisms underlying Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures (PNES). We will begin by establishing a rigorous definition of PNES and contrasting it with its neurophysiological counterpart, the epileptic seizure. We will then explore the key diagnostic hallmarks, from electroencephalographic signatures to clinical semiology. Subsequently, the chapter will integrate the neurological and psychiatric diagnostic frameworks, differentiate PNES from conditions involving intentional deception, and delve into contemporary neurobiological and cognitive models that seek to explain its pathophysiology. Finally, we will consider the critical role of language and communication in the diagnosis and management of this complex disorder.

### Defining Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures (PNES)

A precise understanding of PNES begins with a clear differentiation from epileptic seizures (ES). This distinction is not merely academic; it is the cornerstone of accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.

#### The Core Distinction: PNES vs. Epileptic Seizures

The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) defines an **epileptic seizure** as a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms resulting from abnormal, excessive, and synchronous neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex. The essence of an epileptic seizure is therefore a quantifiable, neurophysiological event: a paroxysm of cortical hypersynchrony.

In contrast, **Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures (PNES)** are paroxysmal episodes of altered movement, sensation, or experience that mimic epileptic seizures but are not caused by epileptiform neuronal discharges. It is crucial to understand that PNES are genuine and experienced as involuntary by the patient. They are classified within the broader category of **Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (FNSD)**, also known as conversion disorder. The symptoms arise from functional changes in [brain network](@entry_id:268668) processing rather than from structural lesions or abnormal electrical discharges [@problem_id:4519942]. This categorization firmly separates PNES from feigned conditions such as malingering, a distinction we will explore in detail later.

#### The Diagnostic Gold Standard: Video-Electroencephalography (vEEG)

Given that the defining feature of PNES is the absence of an epileptic electrical signature during a seizure-like event, the diagnostic gold standard is the capture of a patient's habitual event using synchronized **video-electroencephalography (vEEG)**. This technique combines continuous EEG recording with simultaneous video and audio recording, allowing for a direct correlation between the patient's observable behavior (the clinical semiology) and their brain's electrical activity.

The diagnosis of PNES is confirmed when a typical spell, as described by the patient and witnesses, is captured on video and the concurrent EEG recording shows no evidence of ictal epileptiform activity. While certain serum biomarkers, such as **[prolactin](@entry_id:155402)** (measured $10$–$20$ minutes post-event) or **creatine kinase**, may be elevated after some types of convulsive epileptic seizures, they are neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific to be diagnostic. Their absence does not rule out epilepsy, and their presence is not universal. Consequently, no single biomarker has achieved the [diagnostic accuracy](@entry_id:185860) required to replace vEEG, which remains the definitive method for establishing an electroclinical diagnosis [@problem_id:4519942].

### Neurophysiological and Semiological Hallmarks

The diagnosis of PNES hinges on differentiating it from epilepsy. This differentiation occurs at two main levels: the neurophysiological patterns recorded on EEG and the observable clinical signs, or semiology, of the event itself.

#### The Language of the EEG: Distinguishing Epileptic and Non-Epileptic Patterns

Scalp EEG measures the summed [postsynaptic potentials](@entry_id:177286) of large populations of cortical pyramidal neurons. Its ability to detect an epileptic seizure depends on the synchronous recruitment of these neurons, which produces a macroscopic electrical field. The patterns generated by epileptic seizures are distinct from the EEG findings during PNES [@problem_id:4519971].

*   **Focal-Onset Epileptic Seizures**: Originating in a discrete cortical region, these seizures typically begin on the EEG as a rhythmic discharge in a limited set of electrodes. Common onset patterns include **low-voltage fast activity (LVFA)**, which is rapid rhythmic activity often greater than $13\,\mathrm{Hz}$, or a developing rhythmic pattern in the theta ($4$-$8\,\mathrm{Hz}$) or alpha ($8$-$13\,\mathrm{Hz}$) range. A cardinal feature is **evolution**: the discharge changes over seconds to minutes, typically increasing in amplitude while decreasing in frequency, and spreading spatially to adjacent brain regions.

*   **Generalized-Onset Epileptic Seizures**: These seizures involve and rapidly engage networks across both cerebral hemispheres from the start. The EEG signature is therefore bilaterally synchronous and symmetric from onset. Classic patterns include **generalized spike-and-wave (GSW)** discharges, such as the archetypal $3\,\mathrm{Hz}$ GSW of typical absence seizures. Tonic seizures are often marked by generalized paroxysmal fast activity accompanied by an **electrodecrement**, a diffuse attenuation or "flattening" of the background EEG signal. These patterns also show stereotyped evolution.

*   **Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures**: Since PNES do not arise from cortical hypersynchrony, their EEG signature is defined by a negative finding: the absence of the evolving ictal patterns described above. During a PNES event captured on vEEG, the recording is typically characterized by:
    *   **Preserved or non-evolving background EEG**: The patient's normal resting brain rhythms may continue unchanged throughout the episode.
    *   **Dominance of artifact**: The motor activity of the event generates significant artifact that can obscure the underlying brain activity. This includes high-frequency **electromyographic (EMG) artifact** from muscle contraction and large, slow, rolling artifacts from head and body movement. Unlike an epileptic discharge, this artifact is typically not phase-locked, rhythmic, or evolving in a stereotyped manner.
    *   **Absence of postictal slowing**: Following a significant epileptic seizure, there is often a period of diffuse cerebral dysfunction reflected on the EEG as generalized slowing. This is typically absent after a PNES event, with the patient and their EEG often returning to baseline immediately.

#### The Language of the Body: Clinical Semiology of PNES

While vEEG is definitive, certain observable clinical features (semiology) captured on video or described by witnesses strongly increase the likelihood of PNES over an epileptic seizure. These signs are valuable because they reflect the integrity of motor and arousal systems that are typically disrupted during an epileptic seizure [@problem_id:4519989].

*   **Forceful Eye Closure**: Sustained, forceful closure of the eyelids, often with active resistance to passive opening by an examiner, is a key sign. This action requires intact top-down voluntary [motor control](@entry_id:148305) and a level of arousal inconsistent with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, during which the eyes are typically open.

*   **Asynchronous and Variable Movements**: Thrashing or jerking movements that are asynchronous (e.g., right and left limbs moving out of phase), arrhythmic, and variable in amplitude and frequency suggest PNES. This motor output is flexible and can often be modulated by distraction or verbal cues, reflecting the engagement of the voluntary motor system, which is fundamentally different from the stereotyped, fixed-frequency oscillation of epileptic clonus.

*   **Complex and Protective Motor Patterns**: Movements such as side-to-side ("no-no") head shaking, rhythmic pelvic thrusting, or flailing limbs that consistently avoid striking nearby objects (e.g., bedrails) point towards PNES. Such complex and seemingly goal-directed or protective motor planning relies on intact cortico-basal ganglia-brainstem circuits, which are compromised during a generalized epileptic seizure that produces more primitive tonic-clonic synergies.

*   **Ictal Crying or Coherent Speech**: The production of emotional vocalizations like crying or sobbing, or the ability to speak coherently during an event, requires the integrated function of limbic, prefrontal, and language networks, as well as a preserved state of arousal. This is generally incompatible with the widespread cortical dysfunction of a major epileptic seizure.

*   **Prolonged and Fluctuating Duration**: PNES can last for many minutes, sometimes with a "waxing and waning" intensity. Most epileptic seizures are self-limited to under two or three minutes due to powerful intrinsic inhibitory mechanisms and [metabolic constraints](@entry_id:270622). A prolonged motor seizure (status epilepticus) is a medical emergency that does not wax and wane and is accompanied by severe, consistent autonomic derangement (e.g., hypoxemia), which is typically absent in PNES.

### The Diagnostic Framework: Integrating Neurological and Psychiatric Perspectives

The diagnosis of PNES is inherently multidisciplinary, residing at the interface of neurology and psychiatry. A comprehensive diagnostic approach requires integrating both the neurological evidence for the absence of [epilepsy](@entry_id:173650) and the psychiatric criteria for a functional disorder.

#### Psychiatric Nosology: Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (FNSD)

In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), PNES are classified as **Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (FNSD) with the specifier "with attacks or seizures"**. The diagnosis requires meeting four criteria:
1.  **Criterion A**: One or more symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory function.
2.  **Criterion B**: Clinical findings provide positive evidence of incompatibility between the symptom and recognized neurological or medical conditions (e.g., the semiological signs described above).
3.  **Criterion C**: The symptom is not better explained by another medical or mental disorder.
4.  **Criterion D**: The symptom causes clinically significant distress or impairment.

This framework represents a crucial shift away from a diagnosis of exclusion (i.e., "medically unexplained symptoms") toward a "rule-in" diagnosis based on positive evidence of internal inconsistency, such as Hoover's sign for functional leg weakness or forceful eye closure during a non-epileptic seizure [@problem_id:4519997].

#### Neurological Certainty: The ILAE Framework

To standardize the confidence with which a diagnosis of PNES is made, the ILAE has proposed a framework based on graded levels of diagnostic certainty, which depend on the quality of the available evidence [@problem_id:4519997]:

*   **Possible PNES**: The diagnosis is based solely on the historical account from the patient or a witness. The description is suggestive of PNES, but no clinician has observed an event. For example, a spouse describing spells with gradual onset, pelvic thrusting, and tightly closed eyes meets this criterion.

*   **Probable PNES**: A trained observer (e.g., a neurologist) has witnessed a typical event, either in person or via video recording, and the semiology is characteristic of PNES. However, there is no concurrent EEG. An epileptologist reviewing a family member's smartphone video of an event showing asynchronous [thrashing](@entry_id:637892) and ictal crying would establish a diagnosis of probable PNES. This level of evidence is sometimes referred to as "clinically established."

*   **Documented PNES**: This is the highest level of certainty, or the gold standard. A typical event has been captured on synchronized vEEG, demonstrating clinical features of PNES without any accompanying ictal epileptiform discharge on the EEG.

These two frameworks are complementary: the DSM-5-TR provides the formal psychiatric syndrome diagnosis, while the ILAE framework quantifies the level of neurological certainty supporting that diagnosis.

#### Differentiating from Intentional Deception: Malingering and Factitious Disorder

A critical, and often challenging, aspect of diagnosis is distinguishing PNES from conditions involving intentional symptom production. The key distinction lies in the inferred motivation and conscious intent [@problem_id:4519981]:

*   **PNES (FNSD)**: The symptoms are not intentionally produced; they are experienced as involuntary.
*   **Factitious Disorder**: The patient intentionally produces or feigns symptoms due to an internal psychological need to assume the "sick role," even in the absence of external rewards.
*   **Malingering**: The patient intentionally produces or feigns symptoms for a recognizable external incentive, such as financial gain (e.g., disability benefits) or avoidance of legal responsibilities.

Inferring intentionality is epistemically difficult, as it is a private mental state. While the presence of an external incentive, such as a medico-legal context, should raise the [prior probability](@entry_id:275634) of malingering, it is not diagnostic in itself. Many individuals with genuine disorders, including PNES, have legitimate reasons to seek disability benefits.

Clinicians may use adjunctive tools like **Symptom Validity Tests (SVTs)** to help assess for non-credible symptom reporting. These tests can provide probabilistic evidence, but they do not yield certainty. Using Bayesian reasoning, a positive SVT result in a high-risk context can substantially increase the posterior probability of malingering. For instance, in a medico-legal case with a prior probability of malingering of $P(M) = 0.40$, a positive test with a sensitivity of $0.80$ and specificity of $0.90$ could increase the posterior probability to approximately $0.84$. Conversely, a negative test in a low-risk patient (e.g., $P(M)=0.10$) could lower the posterior probability to around $0.024$. However, even a high posterior probability is not definitive proof of intent for any single event. The diagnosis of PNES should be made based on positive criteria, and a co-occurring diagnosis of malingering should only be made with a convergence of compelling evidence of deliberate fabrication [@problem_id:4519981].

### Etiological and Mechanistic Models of PNES

While the precise pathophysiology of PNES is still under investigation, research has converged on several key concepts related to risk factors, psychological mechanisms, and underlying [brain network](@entry_id:268668) dysfunction.

#### Risk Factors and Causality

It is essential to distinguish between a **risk factor** and a **causal factor**. A risk factor is any variable statistically associated with an outcome (i.e., $P(\text{PNES} | X) > P(\text{PNES} | \neg X)$). A causal factor is one where an intervention to change the factor would lead to a change in the outcome's probability (i.e., $P(\text{PNES} | \mathrm{do}(X))$ changes). Association does not imply causation [@problem_id:4519946].

Prospective studies have identified several robust risk factors for PNES. For example, a history of trauma (especially childhood sexual abuse), a diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and female sex are consistently associated with increased odds of developing PNES. Establishing that these are causal factors is far more difficult, requiring evidence beyond observational association, such as that from randomized controlled trials (e.g., showing that effective treatment of PTSD reduces PNES incidence) or well-designed quasi-experimental studies.

#### The Role of Dissociation

**Dissociation** is a core psychological construct in PNES. Broadly defined, it is a disruption in the normally integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, and sensorimotor control. It exists on a continuum from normal everyday experiences (e.g., "zoning out") to severe, pathological states.

In clinical research, dissociation is operationalized and quantified using validated self-report scales. A prominent example is the **Dissociative Experiences Scale II (DES-II)**, a 28-item questionnaire that assesses amnesia, depersonalization/derealization, and absorption. The DES-II has demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including high internal consistency (Cronbach’s $\alpha \approx 0.90$) and test-retest reliability. It also shows good construct validity, correlating with trauma history and reliably distinguishing PNES cohorts from [epilepsy](@entry_id:173650) cohorts, with patients with PNES typically scoring significantly higher [@problem_id:4519922].

#### A Network Neuroscience Model: The Hijacked Motor System

Contemporary neuroimaging research frames PNES as a disorder of large-scale brain network dynamics. A prominent model posits a failure of top-down regulation of emotion and [motor control](@entry_id:148305), effectively allowing the motor system to be "hijacked" by intense affective states [@problem_id:4519925]. The key network players in this model are:

1.  **Salience Network**: Comprising the anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, this network is responsible for detecting and directing attention to behaviorally relevant stimuli. In PNES, it is thought to be hyperactive, assigning aberrant salience to internal emotional and interoceptive (bodily) cues.

2.  **Limbic System**: Structures like the amygdala, which process emotion and threat, are subsequently over-driven by the hyperactive salience network.

3.  **Prefrontal Cortex**: Regions such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which are critical for executive function and top-down inhibitory control, show diminished engagement.

According to this model, a PNES event unfolds when intense, salience-driven limbic activity generates a strong bottom-up drive to motor preparation areas (e.g., the supplementary motor area). This drive is not adequately suppressed by the underactive prefrontal control systems. Using a simplified abstraction where motor release occurs if limbic drive ($w_{L\to M}$) minus prefrontal inhibition ($w_{P\to M}$) exceeds a threshold ($T_M$), PNES results when $w_{L\to M} - w_{P\to M} \ge T_M$. The resulting motor output is experienced as involuntary because it bypasses the normal volitional pathways, leading to a mismatch in the brain's [predictive coding](@entry_id:150716) mechanisms that generate our sense of agency [@problem_id:4519925].

#### A Cognitive Model: Predictive Processing and Interoceptive Inference

The network model can be complemented by a cognitive account based on **predictive processing** and active inference. This framework views the brain as a prediction machine that constantly tries to minimize prediction error—the mismatch between what it expects and what it senses. PNES can be conceptualized as arising from maladaptive predictions about the meaning of internal bodily sensations (interoception) [@problem_id:4519964].

In this view, a patient with PNES holds a strong, high-precision prior belief (a strong expectation) that certain interoceptive cues (e.g., palpitations, tingling) are harbingers of a "seizure." When these benign sensations occur, they generate a [prediction error](@entry_id:753692). Because the prior belief in the "seizure" cause is held with such high precision (confidence), the most efficient way for the brain to explain away this error is to confirm the prediction. This triggers an "active inference," where the body enacts the seizure behavior—the very "policy" that best resolves the sensory conflict under the current maladaptive model. The therapeutic mechanism of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be understood as a process of explicitly updating this generative model: weakening the precision of the seizure-related prior beliefs and recalibrating the likelihoods connecting interoceptive sensations to catastrophic outcomes.

### Communicating the Diagnosis: The Importance of Language

The final, and perhaps most critical, principle in the management of PNES is the careful and deliberate use of language when communicating the diagnosis. The terminology used for this condition has evolved significantly over time, from the historically freighted and pejorative term "hysteria," to "conversion disorder," to the more common contemporary terms "psychogenic non-epileptic seizures" and "dissociative seizures" [@problem_id:4519924].

This evolution reflects a move away from moralizing attributions toward a more neutral, biopsychosocial, and mechanistic framework. Communication science teaches that framing effects are powerful: the words used to present information can dramatically shape perception and subsequent behavior. Labels perceived as stigmatizing can reduce patient trust, decrease diagnostic acceptance, and hinder engagement in necessary treatment, such as psychotherapy.

Hypothetical trial data illustrate this principle powerfully. In a scenario where patients are randomized to receive different diagnostic labels, terms like "dissociative seizures" lead to significantly higher rates of diagnostic acceptance ($74\%$) and psychotherapy initiation ($63\%$) compared to "psychogenic non-epileptic seizures" ($58\%$ and $49\%$, respectively) and especially "hysteria" ($28\%$ and $22\%$, respectively). The absolute increase in therapy initiation when using "dissociative seizures" over "PNES" is $14\%$. This corresponds to a **Number Needed to Treat (NNT)** of $8$ ($1/0.14$, rounded up), meaning that a clinician would only need to use the preferred term with $8$ patients to cause one additional patient to initiate recommended therapy. This demonstrates that the choice of terminology is not merely semantic—it is a powerful clinical intervention in its own right, directly impacting patient outcomes and aligning with the ethical principles of nonmaleficence and respect for autonomy [@problem_id:4519924].
