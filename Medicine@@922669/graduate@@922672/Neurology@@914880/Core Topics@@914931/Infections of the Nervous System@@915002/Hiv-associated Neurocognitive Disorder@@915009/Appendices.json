The cognitive battery includes Trail Making Test Part A (TMT-A, seconds), Trail Making Test Part B (TMT-B, seconds), Digit Symbol Coding (raw total correct), and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test–Revised (HVLT-R) learning (sum across three trials). The observed values are $50$ seconds on TMT-A, $120$ seconds on TMT-B, $45$ on Digit Symbol, and $18$ on HVLT-R learning.

It is scientifically grounded in standard neuropsychological assessment principles, well-posed with all necessary information and definitions provided, and structured objectively, allowing for a unique and verifiable solution.\n\nThe task is to compute domain-specific $z$-scores for processing speed, executive functioning, and learning, and then to determine the number of domains that meet the criterion for impairment.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the $z$-score for each individual neuropsychological test. The problem specifies two different formulas for the $z$-score depending on the nature of the measure.\n\nFor non-timed measures where a higher score indicates better performance (Digit Symbol, HVLT-R learning), the standard $z$-score is used:\n$$z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\nwhere $x$ is the observed score, $\\mu$ is the normative mean, and $\\sigma$ is the normative standard deviation.\n\nFor timed measures where a higher score (more time taken) indicates worse performance (TMT-A, TMT-B), a direction-corrected $z$-score is used to ensure that more negative values consistently represent worse performance:\n$$z = \\frac{\\mu - x}{\\sigma}$$\n\nWe will now calculate the $z$-score for each of the four tests.\n\n1.  **Trail Making Test Part A (TMT-A):** This is a timed measure.\n    The observed score is $x_{\\text{TMT-A}} = 50$.\n    The normative mean is $\\mu_{\\text{TMT-A}} = 30$.\n    The normative standard deviation is $\\sigma_{\\text{TMT-A}} = 8$.\n    $$z_{\\text{TMT-A}} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\text{TMT-A}} - x_{\\text{TMT-A}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{TMT-A}}} = \\frac{30 - 50}{8} = \\frac{-20}{8} = -2.5$$\n\n2.  **Digit Symbol Coding (DSC):** This is a non-timed measure.\n    The observed score is $x_{\\text{DSC}} = 45$.\n    The normative mean is $\\mu_{\\text{DSC}} = 65$.\n    The normative standard deviation is $\\sigma_{\\text{DSC}} = 10$.\n    $$z_{\\text{DSC}} = \\frac{x_{\\text{DSC}} - \\mu_{\\text{DSC}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{DSC}}} = \\frac{45 - 65}{10} = \\frac{-20}{10} = -2.0$$\n\n3.  **Trail Making Test Part B (TMT-B):** This is a timed measure.\n    The observed score is $x_{\\text{TMT-B}} = 120$.\n    The normative mean is $\\mu_{\\text{TMT-B}} = 75$.\n    The normative standard deviation is $\\sigma_{\\text{TMT-B}} = 20$.\n    $$z_{\\text{TMT-B}} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\text{TMT-B}} - x_{\\text{TMT-B}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{TMT-B}}} = \\frac{75 - 120}{20} = \\frac{-45}{20} = -2.25$$\n\n4.  **Hopkins Verbal Learning Test–Revised (HVLT-R) learning:** This is a non-timed measure.\n    The observed score is $x_{\\text{HVLT-R}} = 18$.\n    The normative mean is $\\mu_{\\text{HVLT-R}} = 24$.\n    The normative standard deviation is $\\sigma_{\\text{HVLT-R}} = 6$.\n    $$z_{\\text{HVLT-R}} = \\frac{x_{\\text{HVLT-R}} - \\mu_{\\text{HVLT-R}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{HVLT-R}}} = \\frac{18 - 24}{6} = \\frac{-6}{6} = -1.0$$\n\nNext, we calculate the domain-specific $z$-scores based on the problem's definitions.\n\n-   **Processing Speed Domain:** This domain is represented by TMT-A and Digit Symbol. The domain score is the arithmetic mean of the constituent test $z$-scores.\n    $$z_{\\text{processing speed}} = \\frac{z_{\\text{TMT-A}} + z_{\\text{DSC}}}{2} = \\frac{-2.5 + (-2.0)}{2} = \\frac{-4.5}{2} = -2.25$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, this is $-2.250$.\n\n-   **Executive Functioning Domain:** This domain is represented solely by TMT-B.\n    $$z_{\\text{executive}} = z_{\\text{TMT-B}} = -2.25$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, this is $-2.250$.\n\n-   **Learning Domain:** This domain is represented solely by HVLT-R learning.\n    $$z_{\\text{learning}} = z_{\\text{HVLT-R}} = -1.0$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, this is $-1.000$.\n\nFinally, we determine the number of impaired domains. Impairment at the domain level is defined as a domain $z$-score $z \\leq -1.0$.\n\n-   Processing speed: $z_{\\text{processing speed}} = -2.250$. Since $-2.250 \\leq -1.0$, this domain is impaired.\n-   Executive functioning: $z_{\\text{executive}} = -2.250$. Since $-2.250 \\leq -1.0$, this domain is impaired.\n-   Learning: $z_{\\text{learning}} = -1.000$. Since $-1.000 \\leq -1.0$, this domain is impaired.\n\nAll three domains meet the criterion for impairment. Therefore, the number of impaired domains, $n_{\\text{impaired domains}}$, is $3$.\n\nThe final answer is to be presented as a row matrix in the order $[z_{\\text{processing speed}}, z_{\\text{executive}}, z_{\\text{learning}}, n_{\\text{impaired domains}}]$.\nThe values are $[-2.250, -2.250, -1.000, 3]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -2.250 & -2.250 & -1.000 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4718967"}, {"introduction": "Once a cognitive profile is established using standardized scores, the next step is to apply formal diagnostic criteria to classify the patient's neurocognitive status.

The complementary events are $H^c$ (no HAND) and $T^c$ (test is negative).\n\n**1. Translate Given Information into Probabilities:**\n- Pre-test prevalence of HAND: $P(H) = 0.25$. This is the prior probability.\n- Sensitivity of the tool: $P(T|H) = 0.80$.

It can be rewritten as:\n$$P(H \\cap T) = P(T|H)P(H)$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, is the total probability of a positive test. Using the law of total probability, we can express this as the sum of true positives and false positives:\n$$P(T) = P(T \\cap H) + P(T \\cap H^c) = P(T|H)P(H) + P(T|H^c)P(H^c)$$\n\nCombining these gives the full form of Bayes' theorem for this problem:\n$$P(H|T) = \\frac{P(T|H)P(H)}{P(T|H)P(H) + P(T|H^c)P(H^c)}$$\n\n**4.
