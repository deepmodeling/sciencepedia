The methodology specified is to use Bayes' theorem in its odds-likelihood ratio form.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\nFirst, I will validate the problem statement.\n\n**Extracted Givens:**\n*   Pre-test probability of neurocysticercosis: $p_{\\text{prior}} = 0.27$.\n*   Diagnostic test: Enzyme-linked Immunoelectrotransfer Blot (EITB) assay.\n*   Test result: Positive.\n*   Positive Likelihood Ratio for EITB in this context: $LR_{+} = 47$.\n*   Assumption: Conditional independence between serology (EITB) and imaging given disease status.\n*   Task: Compute the post-test (posterior) probability, $p_{\\text{post}}$.\n*   Rounding: The final answer must be a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n\n**Validation Verdict:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard application of Bayesian inference in medical diagnosis, a core concept in biostatistics and epidemiology. The provided values are plausible for the clinical scenario. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary information provided for its solution.

There are no violations of scientific principles, logical contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\nThe problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has neurocysticercosis. The prior probability of this event is given as:\n$$P(D) = p_{\\text{prior}} = 0.27$$\nLet $E$ be the evidence, which is a positive result from the EITB test. We are asked to find the posterior probability, $P(D|E)$, which we denote as $p_{\\text{post}}$.\n\nThe solution will be derived in three parts as specified: converting probability to odds, applying Bayes' theorem in odds form, and converting the resulting odds back to probability.\n\n**Part A: Convert Prior Probability to Prior Odds**\n\nThe odds of an event are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring. The prior odds of having neurocysticercosis, $O_{\\text{prior}}$, are calculated from the prior probability $p_{\\text{prior}}$ as follows:\n$$O_{\\text{prior}} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} = \\frac{p_{\\text{prior}}}{1 - p_{\\text{prior}}}$$\nHere, $D^c$ represents the event that the patient does not have neurocysticercosis. Substituting the given value of $p_{\\text{prior}}$:\n$$O_{\\text{prior}} = \\frac{0.27}{1 - 0.27} = \\frac{0.27}{0.73}$$\n\n**Part B: Apply Bayes' Theorem in Odds Form**\n\nBayes' theorem can be expressed in terms of odds and the likelihood ratio. The posterior odds, $O_{\\text{post}}$, are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio ($LR$).\n$$O_{\\text{post}} = O_{\\text{prior}} \\times LR$$\nSince the evidence $E$ is a positive test result, we must use the positive likelihood ratio, $LR_{+}$. The problem states $LR_{+} = 47$.\nThe posterior odds, $O_{\\text{post}}$, are the odds of having the disease after observing the positive test result.\n$$O_{\\text{post}} = P(D|E) / P(D^c|E)$$\nThe relationship is:\n$$O_{\\text{post}} = O_{\\text{prior}} \\times LR_{+}$$\nSubstituting the values for $O_{\\text{prior}}$ and $LR_{+}$:\n$$O_{\\text{post}} = \\left(\\frac{0.27}{0.73}\\right) \\times 47$$\n$$O_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{0.27 \\times 47}{0.73} = \\frac{12.69}{0.73}$$\n\n**Part C: Convert Posterior Odds to Posterior Probability**\n\nThe posterior probability, $p_{\\text{post}}$, can be calculated from the posterior odds, $O_{\\text{post}}$, using the following relationship:\n$$p_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{O_{\\text{post}}}{1 + O_{\\text{post}}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $O_{\\text{post}}$:\n$$p_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{\\frac{12.69}{0.73}}{1 + \\frac{12.69}{0.73}}$$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $0.73$:\n$$p_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{12.69}{0.73 + 12.69} = \\frac{12.69}{13.42}$$\nNow, we perform the division to obtain a numerical value:\n$$p_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.94560357675...$$\n\n**Part D: Final Rounding**\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9$, $4$, $5$, and $6$. The fifth digit is $0$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we truncate).\n$$p_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.9456$$\nThis is the posterior probability that the lesion represents neurocysticercosis, given the positive EITB result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9456}$$", "id": "4503626"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis of active parenchymal neurocysticercosis is confirmed, the focus shifts to designing a safe and effective treatment regimen. The principles of pharmacotherapy are paramount, requiring precise dose calculations tailored to the individual patient and the specific characteristics of their disease.

Well-tested clinical guidance from expert societies such as the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) indicates short-course therapy for parenchymal neurocysticercosis is $10$ to $14$ days, with the longer end favored for higher lesion burden to balance efficacy and the risk of treatment-provoked inflammation. Since this patient has multiple parenchymal lesions, selecting $T = 14$ days is justified and consistent with accepted practice.\n\nWe now compute the total cumulative albendazole dose.

Neurocysticercosis arises in humans when larval cysticerci establish in the central nervous system, but in this model the sole infectious human compartment is taeniasis, represented by adult intestinal tapeworm carriers. Let the total human population be $N_h$ and the total pig population be $N_p$, assumed constant over the time scale considered. Let $S_h$ and $I_h$ denote susceptible and taeniasis-infected humans, respectively, and let $S_p$ and $I_p$ denote susceptible and cysticercosis-infected pigs, respectively.

The dynamics of the infected ($I_h, I_p$) and susceptible ($S_h, S_p$) populations are described by a system of four ordinary differential equations. An important detail is the statement that total populations $N_h$ and $N_p$ are constant. Examining the sum of the rates of change for the human compartments, we have $\\frac{d(S_h+I_h)}{dt} = \\frac{dS_h}{dt} + \\frac{dI_h}{dt} = (-\\beta_{ph}S_hI_p) + (\\beta_{ph}S_hI_p - \\gamma_hI_h) = -\\gamma_hI_h$. This indicates that the sum of susceptible and infected humans, $S_h+I_h$, is not constant. This apparent contradiction is resolved by interpreting the model as a Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) type, where the term $-\\gamma_hI_h$ represents a flow from the infected class $I_h$ to a 'Removed' class $R_h$ which is not explicitly modeled. In this framework, the total population is $N_h = S_h + I_h + R_h$, and this sum is constant. The same logic applies to the pig population. The Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE), characterized by $(S_h, I_h, R_h, S_p, I_p, R_p) = (N_h, 0, 0, N_p, 0, 0)$, represents a state where the entire population is susceptible, which is the standard condition for calculating $R_0$. With this clarification, the problem is well-defined and valid.\n\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is defined as the expected number of secondary infections produced by a single typical infected individual introduced into a completely susceptible population. For a multi-host system, we can derive $R_0$ by considering the full transmission cycle.\n\nLet's follow a \"first principles\" approach as requested.\nThe average infectious period for a human with taeniasis is $1/\\gamma_h$.\nThe average infectious period for a pig with cysticercosis is $1/\\gamma_p$.\n\nConsider a single infected human, $I_h$, introduced into a fully susceptible population.

The number of new human cases generated by a single primary human case is the product of the number of pigs it infects ($R_{hp}$) and the number of humans each of those pigs subsequently infects ($R_{ph}$). This product is $R_{hp} R_{ph}$.
