This probability is denoted as $P(\\text{PML} \\mid +)$. We will use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, let us define the relevant events:\n-   Let $D$ be the event that a patient has PML.\n-   Let $\\neg D$ be the event that a patient does not have PML.\n-   Let $+$ be the event that the CSF JCV PCR test is positive.\n-   Let $-$ be the event that the CSF JCV PCR test is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1.  The pretest prevalence of PML, which is the prior probability of having the disease: $P(D) = 0.12$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease: $P(+ \\mid D) = 0.80$.\n3.  The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease: $P(- \\mid \\neg D) = 0.99$.\n\nFrom these given values, we can derive two additional probabilities that are necessary for the calculation.\nFirst, the prior probability of not having the disease is the complement of the prior probability of having the disease:\n$$P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88$$\nSecond, the probability of a positive test result given that the patient does not have the disease (the false positive rate) is the complement of the specificity:\n$$P(+ \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - P(- \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$$\n\nThe quantity we need to find is the post-test probability, $P(D \\mid +)$. According to Bayes' theorem, this is given by:\n$$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(+)}$$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, summing over the two mutually exclusive scenarios: having the disease or not having the disease.\n$$P(+) = P(+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(+ \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)$$\nThis term represents the probability of a positive test in the entire cohort, which consists of true positives ($P(+ \\mid D) P(D)$) and false positives ($P(+ \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)$).\n\nSubstituting the expanded expression for $P(+)$ into Bayes' theorem gives the full formula for the post-test probability:\n$$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(+ \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}$$\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values into this formula:\n$$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{(0.80)(0.12)}{(0.80)(0.12) + (0.01)(0.88)}$$\nLet's calculate the terms in the numerator and denominator.\nThe numerator is the probability of a true positive result for a randomly selected patient from the cohort:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = 0.80 \\times 0.12 = 0.096$$\nThe first term in the denominator is identical to the numerator:\n$$P(+ \\mid D) P(D) = 0.096$$\nThe second term in the denominator is the probability of a false positive result for a randomly selected patient from the cohort:\n$$P(+ \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D) = 0.01 \\times 0.88 = 0.0088$$\nThe total probability of a positive test, $P(+)$, is the sum of these two terms:\n$$P(+) = 0.096 + 0.0088 = 0.1048$$\nFinally, we can calculate the post-test probability $P(D \\mid +)$:\n$$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{0.096}{0.1048} \\approx 0.91603053435...$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

This rate provides a specific metric for the speed of lesion enlargement, which is a critical factor for prognosis and therapeutic management. A rapid expansion, as suggested by this rate, is a poor prognostic indicator and underscores the urgency for effective treatment to slow or halt the pathological process.

We can analyze the data at two time points: baseline (while on natalizumab) and at 3 weeks after cessation.\n\n**State at Baseline (on Natalizumab):**\n- **Virology & Immunology:** The very high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) John Cunningham virus (JCV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) count ($1.2 \\times 10^6$ copies/mL) confirms massive, active viral replication. This occurs in the context of a profoundly suppressed central nervous system (CNS) immune response, evidenced by the very low CSF white blood cell (WBC) count ($2$ cells/$\\mu$L). This is the expected effect of natalizumab, which blocks lymphocyte entry into the CNS.\n- **Imaging:** The MRI shows a lesion typical of classic PML: subcortical white matter demyelination with active viral replication at the edge (restricted diffusion) but without significant inflammation (no gadolinium enhancement or mass effect).\n- **Synthesis:** The baseline data is classic for active PML in an iatrogenically immunosuppressed patient.\n\n**State at 3 Weeks (post-Natalizumab Cessation):**\n- **Intervention:** Stopping natalizumab restores the ability of lymphocytes to enter the CNS, initiating an immune response.\n- **Clinical Course:** The patient's clinical deterioration after stopping the immunosuppressive drug is the \"paradoxical\" worsening that defines IRIS.\n- **Virology & Immunology:** The dramatic drop in the CSF JCV PCR count (by nearly two orders of magnitude to $3.0 \\times 10^4$ copies/mL) indicates that the newly reconstituted immune response is successfully controlling the virus. Concurrently, the sharp rise in CSF WBC count to $38$ cells/$\\mu$L (pleocytosis) confirms an active inflammatory cell influx into the CNS.\n- **Imaging:** The new MRI findings of gadolinium enhancement, edema, and mass effect are direct visual correlates of this inflammation, indicating a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier caused by the immune response.\n- **Synthesis:** The combination of paradoxical clinical worsening, decreasing viral load, and increasing signs of inflammation (both in CSF and on MRI) is the pathognomonic triad for PML-IRIS.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome complicating Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML-IRIS) following natalizumab cessation.**\nThis interpretation correctly integrates all the findings: PML is complicated by a paradoxical inflammatory worsening (IRIS) that is temporally linked to the restoration of immune function (natalizumab cessation), characterized by falling viral load and rising inflammation. This is the best fit.\n\n**B. Ongoing uncontrolled JCV replication with progression of PML in a persistently immunosuppressed state.**\nThis is incorrect. JCV replication is being controlled (viral load is plummeting), and the state is no longer immunosuppressed within the CNS (evidenced by CSF pleocytosis and inflammatory MRI changes).\n\n**C. PML regression under effective antiviral control without inflammation.**\nThis is partially correct in that there is effective antiviral control, but incorrect in stating it is \"without inflammation.\" The clinical and radiological evidence for a massive inflammatory response is overwhelming.\n\n**D. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) due to therapy-related blood pressure fluctuations.**\nThis is incorrect. The problem states that blood pressure was stable. Moreover, the findings are driven by a confirmed viral infection (JCV) and its interaction with the immune system, which is not the pathophysiology of PRES.\n\nTherefore, the complete clinical picture is unequivocally that of PML-IRIS.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4519272"}]}
