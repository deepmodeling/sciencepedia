The model, while a simplification of a complex biological system, is a standard and appropriate representation for this type of analysis.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the steady-state CSF-to-serum glucose ratio, $R$, based on a mass balance model of a single, well-mixed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartment. The fundamental principle governing the concentration of glucose in the CSF is the conservation of mass. The rate of change of the amount of glucose within the CSF compartment is equal to the rate at which glucose enters the compartment minus the rate at which it leaves.\n\nLet $G(t)$ be the glucose concentration in the CSF at time $t$, and let $V$ be the fixed volume of the CSF compartment. The total amount of glucose in the compartment at time $t$ is $M(t) = G(t)V$. The rate of change of this amount is $\\frac{dM}{dt} = V \\frac{dG}{dt}$.\n\nThe rate of glucose influx into the compartment is determined by the production of new CSF. The volumetric flow rate of CSF production is $Q$, and the glucose concentration in this newly formed fluid (derived from serum) is given as the constant serum concentration $G_s$. Therefore, the rate of glucose influx is:\n$$ \\text{Rate In} = Q G_s $$\n\nThe rate of glucose efflux from the compartment occurs through two pathways:\n1.  Bulk absorption of CSF: CSF is absorbed at the same volumetric flow rate $Q$. Since the compartment is assumed to be well-mixed, the concentration of the absorbed fluid is the same as the concentration within the compartment, $G(t)$. The rate of glucose removal via bulk flow is $Q G(t)$.\n2.  Metabolic utilization: Bacteria and leukocytes consume glucose at a constant, zero-order rate $u$. This represents a direct removal of glucose amount per unit time.\n\nThe total rate of glucose efflux is the sum of these two pathways:\n$$ \\text{Rate Out} = Q G(t) + u $$\n\nThe mass balance equation can now be written as:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} = \\text{Rate In} - \\text{Rate Out} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the rates and the total amount:\n$$ V \\frac{dG}{dt} = Q G_s - (Q G(t) + u) $$\n$$ V \\frac{dG}{dt} = Q G_s - Q G(t) - u $$\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state solution. At steady state, the concentration of glucose in the CSF, denoted $G_{\\text{CSF}}$, is constant. This implies that its time derivative is zero: $\\frac{dG}{dt} = 0$. Setting the derivative to zero and replacing $G(t)$ with $G_{\\text{CSF}}$:\n$$ 0 = Q G_s - Q G_{\\text{CSF}} - u $$\n\nWe can now solve for the steady-state CSF glucose concentration, $G_{\\text{CSF}}$:\n$$ Q G_{\\text{CSF}} = Q G_s - u $$\n$$ G_{\\text{CSF}} = \\frac{Q G_s - u}{Q} $$\n$$ G_{\\text{CSF}} = G_s - \\frac{u}{Q} $$\n\nFor this solution to be physically meaningful, the concentration $G_{\\text{CSF}}$ must be non-negative, i.e., $G_{\\text{CSF}} \\ge 0$. This imposes a condition on the parameters of the system:\n$$ G_s - \\frac{u}{Q} \\ge 0 $$\n$$ G_s \\ge \\frac{u}{Q} $$\n$$ Q G_s \\ge u $$\nThis condition states that the rate of glucose influx ($Q G_s$) must be greater than or equal to the rate of glucose utilization ($u$) to maintain a non-negative glucose concentration at steady state.\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state CSF-to-serum glucose ratio, $R$, which is defined as $R = G_{\\text{CSF}} / G_s$.

Rearranging the inequality gives:\n$$MAP \\geq CPP_{crit} + ICP(t)$$\n\nThis must be true for all $t \\geq 0$. Therefore, the chosen $MAP$ must be greater than or equal to $CPP_{crit}$ plus the maximum value of $ICP(t)$ over the domain $t \\geq 0$. Let this maximum value be $ICP_{max}$.\n$$ICP_{max} = \\max_{t \\geq 0} \\{ICP(t)\\}$$\n\nThe minimum constant mean arterial pressure, $MAP_{min}$, that satisfies this condition is therefore:\n$$MAP_{min} = CPP_{crit} + ICP_{max}$$\n\nThe primary task is to find the maximum value of the function $ICP(t)$:\n$$ICP(t) = I_b + A \\exp(-k_1 t) + B\\, t\\, \\exp(-k_2 t)$$\n\nTo find the maximum, we compute the first derivative of $ICP(t)$ with respect to $t$ and set it to zero.\n$$\\frac{d(ICP)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ I_b + A \\exp(-k_1 t) + B\\, t\\, \\exp(-k_2 t) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{d(ICP)}{dt} = 0 - A k_1 \\exp(-k_1 t) + B \\left( 1 \\cdot \\exp(-k_2 t) + t \\cdot (-k_2) \\exp(-k_2 t) \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{d(ICP)}{dt} = -A k_1 \\exp(-k_1 t) + B (1 - k_2 t) \\exp(-k_2 t)$$\n\nWe set the derivative to zero to find the critical time, $t_{max}$, where the maximum pressure occurs.\n$$-A k_1 \\exp(-k_1 t_{max}) + B (1 - k_2 t_{max}) \\exp(-k_2 t_{max}) = 0$$\n\nWe must check the boundary condition at $t=0$.

The derivation proceeds in two main stages: first, modeling the antibiotic concentration profile within the biofilm, and second, applying the specified pharmacodynamic criterion for eradication.\n\n**1. Diffusion-Reaction Model for Antibiotic Concentration**\n\nThe transport of the antibiotic within the biofilm is governed by Fick's second law of diffusion with a reaction term. In one dimension, $x$, the general equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} - R(C) $$\nwhere $C(x,t)$ is the antibiotic concentration, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $R(C)$ is the rate of antibiotic removal. The problem states that the system is at steady state, so $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = 0$. The removal is due to non-specific binding/uptake, which follows first-order kinetics, meaning $R(C) = kC$, where $k$ is the first-order rate constant.\n\nSubstituting these conditions into the general transport equation yields the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the steady-state concentration profile $C(x)$:\n$$ D \\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} - kC = 0 $$\nThis equation can be rewritten in a standard form:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} - \\frac{k}{D} C = 0 $$\nThis is a second-order, linear, homogeneous ODE. Let us define a characteristic length scale parameter $\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}$, which is the reciprocal of a diffusion length. The ODE becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} - \\lambda^2 C = 0 $$\nThe general solution to this ODE is a linear combination of hyperbolic functions:\n$$ C(x) = A \\cosh(\\lambda x) + B \\sinh(\\lambda x) $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions are given as:\n1.  At the CSF-biofilm interface ($x=0$), the concentration is equal to the CSF concentration, $C_s$:\n    $$ C(0) = C_s $$\n2.  At the biofilm-catheter interface ($x=L$), there is no net flux of the antibiotic into the inert catheter material. According to Fick's first law, flux $J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$, so a no-flux condition means the concentration gradient is zero:\n    $$ \\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} = 0 $$\n\nApplying the first boundary condition to the general solution:\n$$ C(0) = A \\cosh(0) + B \\sinh(0) = A(1) + B(0) = A $$\nThus, $A = C_s$. The solution becomes:\n$$ C(x) = C_s \\cosh(\\lambda x) + B \\sinh(\\lambda x) $$\n\nNext, we apply the second boundary condition. First, we find the derivative of $C(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dx} = C_s \\lambda \\sinh(\\lambda x) + B \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda x) $$\nEvaluating this at $x=L$ and setting it to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} = C_s \\lambda \\sinh(\\lambda L) + B \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda L) = 0 $$\nSince $\\lambda \\neq 0$, we can divide by it and solve for $B$:\n$$ B \\cosh(\\lambda L) = -C_s \\sinh(\\lambda L) \\implies B = -C_s \\frac{\\sinh(\\lambda L)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} = -C_s \\tanh(\\lambda L) $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $A$ and $B$ back into the solution for $C(x)$:\n$$ C(x) = C_s \\cosh(\\lambda x) - C_s \\tanh(\\lambda L) \\sinh(\\lambda x) $$\n$$ C(x) = C_s \\left( \\cosh(\\lambda x) - \\frac{\\sinh(\\lambda L)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} \\sinh(\\lambda x) \\right) $$\n$$ C(x) = C_s \\frac{\\cosh(\\lambda x)\\cosh(\\lambda L) - \\sinh(\\lambda x)\\sinh(\\lambda L)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} $$\nUsing the hyperbolic identity $\\cosh(u-v) = \\cosh(u)\\cosh(v) - \\sinh(u)\\sinh(v)$, with $u = \\lambda L$ and $v = \\lambda x$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ C(x) = C_s \\frac{\\cosh(\\lambda(L-x))}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} $$\nThis equation describes the antibiotic concentration at any depth $x$ within the biofilm.\n\n**2. Eradication Condition and Minimal CSF Concentration**\n\nThe eradication of the bacterial population requires the net per-capita growth rate to be negative everywhere in the biofilm. The net rate is the difference between the natural growth rate, $g$, and the antibiotic kill rate, $r_k(C)$. The eradication condition is:\n$$ g - r_k(C(x))  0 \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in [0, L] $$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$$ r_k(C(x))  g \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in [0, L] $$\nThe problem defines eradication with a non-strict inequality, $r_k(C(x)) \\ge g$, which we will use. The kill rate is given by the saturable function $r_k(C) = \\alpha \\frac{C}{C+K}$. So the condition is:\n$$ \\alpha \\frac{C(x)}{C(x)+K} \\ge g $$\nSolving this inequality for $C(x)$, assuming $\\alpha  g$ (a prerequisite for eradication to be possible):\n$$ \\alpha C(x) \\ge g(C(x) + K) $$\n$$ (\\alpha - g)C(x) \\ge gK $$\n$$ C(x) \\ge \\frac{gK}{\\alpha - g} $$\nLet $C_{crit} = \\frac{gK}{\\alpha - g}$ be the critical concentration required to achieve a non-positive net growth rate. The eradication condition requires that the concentration at all points within the biofilm, $C(x)$, must be at least $C_{crit}$. This is equivalent to requiring that the minimum concentration in the biofilm, $C_{min}$, satisfies the condition:\n$$ C_{min} \\ge C_{crit} $$\nTo find $C_{min}$, we examine the concentration profile $C(x) = C_s \\frac{\\cosh(\\lambda(L-x))}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)}$. The function $\\cosh(u)$ is an increasing function for $u \\ge 0$. As $x$ increases from $0$ to $L$, the argument $\\lambda(L-x)$ decreases from $\\lambda L$ to $0$. Consequently, $C(x)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $x$. The minimum concentration therefore occurs at the deepest point in the biofilm, $x=L$:\n$$ C_{min} = C(L) = C_s \\frac{\\cosh(\\lambda(L-L))}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} = C_s \\frac{\\cosh(0)}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} = \\frac{C_s}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} $$\nNow we impose the eradication condition on $C_{min}$:\n$$ \\frac{C_s}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} \\ge \\frac{gK}{\\alpha - g} $$\nThe minimal CSF concentration, $C_{s,\\min}$, is the value of $C_s$ that makes this an equality:\n$$ \\frac{C_{s,\\min}}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)} = \\frac{gK}{\\alpha - g} $$\nSolving for $C_{s,\\min}$ and substituting back $\\lambda = \\sqrt{k/D}$, we arrive at the closed-form solution:\n$$ C_{s,\\min} = \\frac{gK}{\\alpha - g} \\cosh\\left(L\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) $$\nThe term $L\\sqrt{k/D}$ is the Thiele modulus, a dimensionless group that compares the rate of reaction to the rate of diffusion.\n\n**3.
