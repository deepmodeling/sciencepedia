The dynamics of these two species can be described by a system of linear first-order ordinary differential equations.\n\nThe rate of change of mRNA molecules is the difference between the constant transcription rate and the first-order degradation rate:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} = r_t - \\delta_m M $$\n\nThe rate of change of protein molecules is the difference between the translation rate, which is proportional to the number of mRNA molecules, and the total first-order degradation rate:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = k_{\\text{trans}} M - \\delta_p P $$\nwhere the total protein degradation rate constant, $\\delta_p$, is the sum of the proteasomal and autophagic rate constants:\n$$ \\delta_p = k_{\\text{prot}} + k_{\\text{auto}} $$\n\nAt steady state, the concentrations of both mRNA and protein are constant, which implies that their time derivatives are equal to zero. Let $M_{ss}$ and $P_{ss}$ denote the steady-state number of molecules.\nSetting $\\frac{dM}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ 0 = r_t - \\delta_m M_{ss} \\implies M_{ss} = \\frac{r_t}{\\delta_m} $$\nSetting $\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ 0 = k_{\\text{trans}} M_{ss} - \\delta_p P_{ss} \\implies P_{ss} = \\frac{k_{\\text{trans}} M_{ss}}{\\delta_p} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $M_{ss}$ into the equation for $P_{ss}$ yields the steady-state number of protein molecules as a function of the system parameters:\n$$ P_{ss} = \\frac{k_{\\text{trans}}}{\\delta_p} \\left( \\frac{r_t}{\\delta_m} \\right) = \\frac{k_{\\text{trans}} r_t}{\\delta_m (k_{\\text{prot}} + k_{\\text{auto}})} $$\nThis equation provides the basis for all subsequent calculations.\n\n### Part 1: Baseline Steady-State Concentration\nFirst, we must ensure all parameters are in consistent units (seconds, liters, moles). The mRNA degradation rate constant $\\delta_m$ is given in terms of hours and must be converted to s$^{-1}$.\n$$ 1 \\text{ hour} = 3600 \\text{ s} $$\n$$ \\delta_m = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{3 \\text{ hours}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{3 \\times 3600 \\text{ s}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{10800} \\text{ s}^{-1} $$\nThe total protein degradation rate constant $\\delta_p$ is:\n$$ \\delta_p = k_{\\text{prot}} + k_{\\text{auto}} = (5.0 \\times 10^{-6} + 7.0 \\times 10^{-6}) \\text{ s}^{-1} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ s}^{-1} $$\nNow, we substitute the given parameter values into the equation for $P_{ss}$:\n- $r_t = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\text{trans}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$\n- $\\delta_m = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{10800}$ s$^{-1}$\n- $\\delta_p = 1.2 \\times 10^{-5}$ s$^{-1}$\n\n$$ P_{ss} = \\frac{(3.0 \\times 10^{-1}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-2})}{(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{10800}) \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{-5})} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 10800}{\\ln(2) \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{-5})} = \\frac{32.4}{\\ln(2) \\times 1.2 \\times 10^{-5}} $$\nNumerically evaluating this expression gives:\n$$ P_{ss} \\approx 3.89505 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ molecules} $$\nThe molar concentration, $C_{ss}$, is the number of moles per unit volume. The number of moles is the number of molecules divided by Avogadro's constant, $N_A$.\n$$ C_{ss} = \\frac{\\text{moles}}{\\text{volume}} = \\frac{P_{ss} / N_A}{V} = \\frac{P_{ss}}{N_A V} $$\nSubstituting the values for $N_A$ and $V$:\n$$ C_{ss} = \\frac{3.89505 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ molecules}}{(6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ mol}^{-1}) \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ L})} \\approx \\frac{3.89505 \\times 10^{6}}{2.4088 \\times 10^{12}} \\text{ mol L}^{-1} $$\n$$ C_{ss} \\approx 1.6169 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ M} $$\nThe question requires the concentration in micromolar (µM), where $1$ M $= 10^6$ µM.\n$$ C_{ss} \\approx (1.6169 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 10^6 \\text{ µM} = 1.6169 \\text{ µM} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the baseline concentration is $1.62$ µM.\n\n### Part 2: Fold-Change upon Gene Dosage Duplication\nGene dosage duplication doubles the transcription rate, so the new transcription rate is $r'_t = 2 r_t$. All other parameters ($k_{\\text{trans}}, \\delta_m, \\delta_p, V, N_A$) are unchanged. Let the new steady-state concentration be $C'_{ss}$.\nThe new steady-state number of protein molecules, $P'_{ss}$, is given by the same formula with $r_t$ replaced by $r'_t$:\n$$ P'_{ss} = \\frac{k_{\\text{trans}} r'_t}{\\delta_m \\delta_p} = \\frac{k_{\\text{trans}} (2 r_t)}{\\delta_m \\delta_p} = 2 \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{trans}} r_t}{\\delta_m \\delta_p} \\right) = 2 P_{ss} $$\nSince the concentration is directly proportional to the number of molecules ($C = P/(N_A V)$), the new concentration is:\n$$ C'_{ss} = \\frac{P'_{ss}}{N_A V} = \\frac{2 P_{ss}}{N_A V} = 2 C_{ss} $$\nThe fold-change is the ratio of the new concentration to the original baseline concentration:\n$$ \\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{C'_{ss}}{C_{ss}} = \\frac{2 C_{ss}}{C_{ss}} = 2 $$\nThis linear relationship is a direct consequence of the model's first-order kinetics and the absence of any feedback loops. The problem requires this value to be reported to three significant figures.

Define\n$$\nz_1 = L x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^N,\\quad z_2 = -x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^N.\n$$\nThen the predicted atrophy rate is\n$$\n\\hat{r}(D,\\lambda) = D z_1 + \\lambda z_2.\n$$\nWe seek\n$$\n\\min_{D \\ge 0,\\ \\lambda \\ge 0} J(D,\\lambda),\\quad J(D,\\lambda) = \\left\\| r - (D z_1 + \\lambda z_2) \\right\\|_2^2.\n$$\nLet $Z = [z_1\\ z_2] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times 2}$ and $\\beta = \\begin{bmatrix} D \\\\ \\lambda \\end{bmatrix}$. Then\n$$\nJ(\\beta) = \\| r - Z \\beta \\|_2^2.\n$$\nIgnoring nonnegativity temporarily, the unconstrained minimizer is the ordinary least squares solution obtained by setting the gradient to zero:\n$$\n\\nabla_\\beta J = -2 Z^\\top (r - Z \\beta) = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad Z^\\top Z \\beta = Z^\\top r.\n$$\nWhen $Z^\\top Z$ is invertible, the solution is\n$$\n\\beta^\\star = (Z^\\top Z)^{-1} Z^\\top r.\n$$\nIf $Z^\\top Z$ is singular or poorly conditioned (for instance, when $z_1 = 0$ due to $L x_0 = 0$, as with constant $x_0$ on a connected regular graph), use the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse or a numerically stable least-squares solver to compute\n$$\n\\beta^\\star = Z^+ r,\n$$\nwhere $Z^+$ denotes the pseudoinverse that minimizes $\\| r - Z \\beta \\|_2$ among all $\\beta$. To enforce the biophysically motivated constraints $D \\ge 0$ and $\\lambda \\ge 0$, we project the unconstrained solution onto the nonnegative orthant:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\beta} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\max(D^\\star, 0) \\\\ \\max(\\lambda^\\star, 0) \\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\nThis projection solves the constrained problem exactly when the unconstrained optimum lies within the feasible set and otherwise gives the closest feasible point in the Euclidean norm among coordinate-wise clamping solutions, which is appropriate here because $Z$ has only two columns and the objective is convex.\n\nAlgorithmic steps for each test case:\n1) Compute the degree matrix $D_{\\text{deg}}$ with $(D_{\\text{deg}})_{ii} = \\sum_j A_{ij}$ and the Laplacian $L = D_{\\text{deg}} - A$.\n2) Form $z_1 = L x_0$ and $z_2 = -x_0$, and stack $Z = [z_1\\ z_2]$.\n3) Solve the least squares problem $Z \\beta \\approx r$ using a numerically stable method (for example, a singular value decomposition-based solver) to obtain $\\beta^\\star$.\n4) Project to nonnegativity: $\\tilde{\\beta}_i = \\max(\\beta^\\star_i, 0)$ for $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\n5) Round $D$ and $\\lambda$ to four decimal places and report $[D,\\lambda]$.\n\nInterpretation in the context of proteopathic neurodegeneration:\n- The term $D L x_0$ models transport along the connectome: pathology flows from high-burden regions to neighbors proportional to connectivity and local gradients encoded by $L$.\n- The term $-\\lambda x_0$ models first-order clearance proportional to current burden.\n- In Test Case $2$, $x_0$ is constant across a connected regular graph, giving $L x_0 = 0$, so transport does not contribute to short-time change and only clearance is identifiable; the estimator rightly returns $D \\approx 0$ while recovering $\\lambda$ from the data.\n- In Test Cases $1$, $3$, and $4$, the data are consistent with the linear model, so the estimator recovers transport and clearance accurately. Disconnected components (Test Case $4$) naturally restrict transport-driven changes to the component containing baseline burden, which the Laplacian captures.\n\nApplying the algorithm to the provided numerical test suite yields, after solving and nonnegativity projection, the parameter pairs $[D^{(k)}, \\lambda^{(k)}]$ per case, reported in a single line as a list of lists, with each value rounded to four decimal places.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef fit_transport_clearance(A, x0, r):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fit the linear network diffusion-reaction model:\n        r ≈ D * (L @ x0) - λ * x0\n    by least squares with non-negativity projection.\n\n    Parameters:\n        A  : adjacency matrix (numpy array, shape NxN)\n        x0 : baseline PET vector (numpy array, shape N)\n        r  : observed MRI atrophy rate vector (numpy array, shape N)\n\n    Returns:\n        (D_hat, lambda_hat) as floats\n    \"\"\"\n    # Compute graph Laplacian L = D_deg - A\n    degree = np.sum(A, axis=1)\n    L = np.diag(degree) - A\n\n    z1 = L @ x0\n    z2 = -x0\n    Z = np.column_stack((z1, z2))\n\n    # Solve least squares Z * beta ≈ r using a numerically stable method\n    beta, *_ = np.linalg.lstsq(Z, r, rcond=None)\n\n    # Project onto nonnegative orthant\n    beta = np.maximum(beta, 0.0)\n\n    D_hat = float(beta[0])\n    lambda_hat = float(beta[1])\n    return D_hat, lambda_hat\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n\n    # Test case 1\n    A1 = np.array([\n        [0.0, 0.4, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0],\n        [0.4, 0.0, 0.3, 0.2, 0.0],\n        [0.1, 0.3, 0.0, 0.5, 0.1],\n        [0.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.0, 0.3],\n        [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.0]\n    ], dtype=float)\n    x01 = np.array([0.8, 0.6, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05], dtype=float)\n    r1 = np.array([-0.128, -0.068, -0.152, -0.138, -0.039], dtype=float)\n\n    # Test case 2\n    A2 = np.array([\n        [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0],\n        [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0],\n        [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0],\n        [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]\n    ], dtype=float)\n    x02 = np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], dtype=float)\n    r2 = np.array([-0.2, -0.2, -0.2, -0.2], dtype=float)\n\n    # Test case 3\n    A3 = np.array([\n        [0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n        [0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n        [0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0],\n        [0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0],\n        [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5],\n        [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0]\n    ], dtype=float)\n    x03 = np.array([1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], dtype=float)\n    r3 = np.array([0.15, -0.25, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], dtype=float)\n\n    # Test case 4\n    A4 = np.array([\n        [0.0, 0.3, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n        [0.3, 0.0, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n        [0.3, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n        [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.0],\n        [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.0, 0.4],\n        [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.0]\n    ], dtype=float)\n    x04 = np.array([0.9, 0.6, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], dtype=float)\n    r4 = np.array([-0.09, -0.213, -0.377, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], dtype=float)\n\n    test_cases = [\n        (A1, x01, r1),\n        (A2, x02, r2),\n        (A3, x03, r3),\n        (A4, x04, r4)\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for A, x0, r in test_cases:\n        D_hat, lambda_hat = fit_transport_clearance(A, x0, r)\n        # Round to four decimal places\n        D_hat = round(D_hat + 0.0, 4)\n        lambda_hat = round(lambda_hat + 0.0, 4)\n        results.append([D_hat, lambda_hat])\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # Single line: list of lists, comma-separated, enclosed in square brackets.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(str(res) for res in results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "4519565"}]}
