{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Managing behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia (BPSD) often involves pharmacotherapy, but these medications carry significant risks that must be carefully evaluated. This exercise provides direct practice in a crucial safety assessment: calculating the heart rate-corrected $QT$ interval ($QTc$) before initiating a drug like citalopram. By applying the standard Bazett's formula, you will translate raw electrocardiogram data into a clinically actionable metric for arrhythmia risk, directly informing a critical decision about medication safety in a vulnerable older adult.", "problem": "A $78$-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease presents with persistent agitation and sleep–wake dysregulation, consistent with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Her electrocardiogram shows a measured $QT$ interval of $440$ $\\mathrm{ms}$ and an $RR$ interval of $0.8$ $\\mathrm{s}$ in sinus rhythm. You are considering citalopram for agitation due to its serotonergic effects on affective dysregulation. The corrected $QT$ interval (defined on first appearance as $QTc$) aims to remove heart rate dependence so that repolarization duration can be compared across different cycle lengths. Empirically, the ventricular repolarization duration scales with cycle length by a power law $QT(RR)=k\\,RR^{\\alpha}$, where $k$ is an individual constant under stable conditions and $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2}$ (Bazett’s scaling). The corrected interval for a given beat is defined as the normalization of $QT(RR)$ to the reference cycle length $RR=1$ $\\mathrm{s}$, i.e., $QTc = QT(RR)/RR^{\\alpha}$. \n\nUsing these foundations, compute the patient’s $QTc$ from the provided $QT$ and $RR$. Then, interpret whether initiating citalopram in an older adult with this $QTc$ would require limiting the daily dose based on widely accepted safety thresholds for torsades de pointes risk (for example, avoidance or discontinuation when $QTc \\geq 500$ $\\mathrm{ms}$ and heightened caution above sex-specific prolongation thresholds). Round your computed $QTc$ to three significant figures and express it in $\\mathrm{ms}$.", "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the corrected QT interval ($QTc$) for a patient and a subsequent interpretation of this value in the context of initiating a specific medication. The validation of the problem statement is the mandatory first step.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Patient age: $78$ years\n- Patient condition: Alzheimer's disease with BPSD\n- Measured QT interval ($QT$): $440 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$\n- Measured RR interval ($RR$): $0.8 \\, \\mathrm{s}$\n- Empirical scaling law: $QT(RR) = k \\, RR^{\\alpha}$\n- Scaling exponent for Bazett's formula: $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Definition of corrected interval: $QTc = \\frac{QT(RR)}{RR^{\\alpha}}$\n- Safety threshold for medication: Avoidance or discontinuation for $QTc \\geq 500 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$\n- Required output format: $QTc$ rounded to three significant figures, expressed in $\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The concepts of QT and RR intervals, heart rate correction using Bazett's formula, and the clinical pharmacology of citalopram (specifically, its potential for QT prolongation) are all standard, factually correct principles in cardiology and clinical medicine. The provided physiological values are realistic.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides all necessary data and a clear formula to calculate a unique value for the $QTc$. The question is unambiguous and has a single, stable solution.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is framed in objective, clinical language. The interpretation is based on applying given quantitative thresholds, not on subjective opinion.\n\nThere are no scientific or factual unsoundness, no fatal ambiguity, and no missing information that would prevent a rigorous solution. The problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Solution\n\nThe primary task is to calculate the corrected QT interval, $QTc$, using the provided data and formula. The problem specifies the use of Bazett's scaling, where the correction exponent is $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe definition of the corrected interval is given as:\n$$QTc = \\frac{QT(RR)}{RR^{\\alpha}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given value for the exponent, $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$, we obtain Bazett's formula:\n$$QTc = \\frac{QT}{\\sqrt{RR}}$$\n\nThe problem provides the measured values:\n- $QT = 440 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$\n- $RR = 0.8 \\, \\mathrm{s}$\n\nIn the standard application of Bazett's formula, the $RR$ interval must be expressed in seconds ($s$), and the measured $QT$ interval is typically in milliseconds ($ms$). The resulting $QTc$ value is then expressed in milliseconds ($ms$). The provided data conform to this convention.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$QTc = \\frac{440 \\, \\mathrm{ms}}{\\sqrt{0.8 \\, \\mathrm{s}}}$$\n\nTo be precise about the units, the definition of $QTc$ normalizes the QT interval to a standard heart rate corresponding to $RR = 1 \\, \\mathrm{s}$. The constant $k$ in the scaling law $QT = k \\cdot RR^{\\alpha}$ has units of $\\mathrm{ms} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-\\alpha}$. The $QTc$ is numerically equal to $k$ when a standard $RR$ of $1\\,\\mathrm{s}$ is used, and its value is reported in $\\mathrm{ms}$. Thus, the calculation proceeds by evaluating the numerical part of the expression:\n$$QTc = \\frac{440}{\\sqrt{0.8}} \\, \\mathrm{ms}$$\n\nNow, we perform the calculation:\n$$\\sqrt{0.8} \\approx 0.89442719...$$\n$$QTc \\approx \\frac{440}{0.89442719} \\, \\mathrm{ms} \\approx 491.93403... \\, \\mathrm{ms}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$QTc \\approx 492 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret this result. The calculated baseline $QTc$ for the patient is approximately $492 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$. This value must be compared to established safety thresholds.\n1.  The problem states a threshold of $QTc \\geq 500 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$ as a level for avoidance or discontinuation of QT-prolonging drugs. The patient's value of $492 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$ is very close to this absolute upper limit.\n2.  The problem also mentions \"heightened caution above sex-specific prolongation thresholds.\" For adult females, a $QTc$ value above approximately $470 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$ is considered prolonged. The patient's value of $492 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$ is significantly above this threshold, indicating marked baseline QT prolongation.\n\nCitalopram is a medication known to cause dose-dependent prolongation of the QT interval. Initiating this drug in a $78$-year-old woman with a baseline $QTc$ of $492 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$ would confer a substantial risk of inducing further prolongation, potentially leading to the life-threatening arrhythmia torsades de pointes. Therefore, based on the calculation and widely accepted safety guidelines, initiating citalopram would require, at a minimum, limiting the daily dose (e.g., to the FDA-recommended maximum of $20 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$/day for patients over $60$), alongside careful cardiac monitoring. Consideration of alternative therapeutic agents that do not carry this risk would also be clinically indicated. The interpretation is that limiting the dose is a mandatory safety measure.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{492} $$", "id": "4454871"}, {"introduction": "Beyond assessing the immediate physiological safety for an individual patient [@problem_id:4454871], a clinician must also understand and communicate population-level risks associated with a treatment class.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of two key epidemiological measures: the Absolute Risk Increase ($\\text{ARI}$) and the Number Needed to Harm ($\\text{NNH}$). These quantities are derived directly from their foundational definitions using the provided risk data.\n\nLet $R_1$ denote the risk in the exposed (treated) group and $R_0$ denote the risk in the unexposed (untreated) group. From the problem statement, these are given as one-year cumulative incidences:\n$$ R_1 = p_1 = 0.035 $$\n$$ R_0 = p_0 = 0.02 $$\n\nThe Absolute Risk Increase ($\\text{ARI}$) is defined as the absolute difference in risk between the exposed group and the unexposed group. It quantifies the excess risk attributable to the exposure.\n$$ \\text{ARI} = R_1 - R_0 $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{ARI} = p_1 - p_0 = 0.035 - 0.02 = 0.015 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be reported to four significant figures. The calculated value is $0.015$. To express this with four significant figures, we write:\n$$ \\text{ARI} = 0.01500 $$\n\nThe Number Needed to Harm ($\\text{NNH}$) is a measure of the number of individuals who need to be exposed to a risk factor over a specific period to cause one additional harmful outcome.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Sample Size Formula\nLet $\\mu_I$ and $\\mu_C$ be the true mean change in NPI scores for the intervention and control groups, respectively. The null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the two-sided alternative hypothesis ($H_A$) are:\n$$H_0: \\mu_I - \\mu_C = 0$$\n$$H_A: \\mu_I - \\mu_C \\neq 0$$\n\nLet $\\bar{X}_I$ and $\\bar{X}_C$ be the sample mean changes in the two arms, and let $n$ be the sample size per arm. The common population standard deviation is $\\sigma = 8$. The test statistic for the difference between two independent means, when $\\sigma$ is known, is given by:\n$$Z = \\frac{(\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_C) - (\\mu_I - \\mu_C)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}}} = \\frac{(\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_C) - (\\mu_I - \\mu_C)}{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}}$$\nUnder the null hypothesis $H_0$, this statistic follows a standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$.\n\nThe type I error rate is $\\alpha = 0.05$. For a two-sided test, we reject $H_0$ if $|Z| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$. The critical value is $z_{1-0.05/2} = z_{0.975}$.\n\nThe power of the test, $1-\\beta = 0.8$, is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when a specific alternative is true. Here, the specific alternative is $\\mu_I - \\mu_C = \\delta = 4$.\nPower $= P(\\text{Reject } H_0 | \\mu_I - \\mu_C = \\delta)$.\nThe rejection region is $|Z| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$, which means $\\frac{|\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_C|}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2/n}} > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$.\nPower is the probability that the observed sample difference falls into the rejection region, given that the true difference is $\\delta$.\n$$1-\\beta = P\\left(\\left|\\frac{\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_C}{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}}\\right| > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\bigg| \\mu_I - \\mu_C = \\delta\\right)$$\nUnder the alternative hypothesis, the sampling distribution of the difference in means is $\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_C \\sim N(\\delta, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n})$.\n\nFor a positive $\\delta$, the power is dominated by the upper tail of the rejection region. We can approximate the power by considering only this part:\n$$1-\\beta \\approx P\\left(\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_C > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}} \\bigg| \\mu_I - \\mu_C = \\delta\\right)$$\nTo evaluate this probability, we standardize the random variable $\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_C$ using its distribution under the alternative hypothesis:\n$$1-\\beta \\approx P\\left( \\frac{(\\bar{X}_I - \\bar{X}_C) - \\delta}{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}} > \\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}} - \\delta}{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}} \\right)$$\nThe term on the left inside the probability is a standard normal variable, which we denote as $Z'$.\n$$1-\\beta \\approx P\\left( Z' > z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\delta \\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2}} \\right)$$\nBy definition of power, $1-\\beta = P(Z' > z_{\\beta})$.
