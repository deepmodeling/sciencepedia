Assume that sCJD events arise as rare, independent occurrences across individuals over short time windows and that inter-event dependence is negligible at the population scale. Under these conditions, annual counts of sCJD in a large, closed population can be modeled by a Poisson process whose one-year count has a Poisson distribution.\n\nConsider a country with population size $N = 50 \\times 10^{6}$ persons and an annual sCJD incidence of $1.5$ per $10^{6}$ persons per year. Use the following foundational epidemiologic-statistical bases: (i) incidence as events per person-time implies an expected annual count equal to population size multiplied by the per-person annual event rate; (ii) for a Poisson count with mean $\\lambda$, the variance is also $\\lambda$; and (iii) for sufficiently large $\\lambda$, the Central Limit Theorem implies the Poisson count is well-approximated by a normal distribution with mean $\\lambda$ and variance $\\lambda$.\n\nTasks:\n1.

Modeling rare, independent events in a large population with a Poisson distribution is a standard and scientifically sound method. The stated incidence of sCJD is consistent with recognized public health data. The use of the normal approximation to the Poisson distribution for a large mean is a direct application of the Central Limit Theorem and is a valid statistical technique.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary data ($N$, incidence rate) and statistical assumptions to complete the requested tasks.

The premises are factually sound, logically coherent, and allow for a rigorous mathematical solution.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n#### Task 1: Derive the expected annual sCJD case count $\\lambda$\nThe problem provides the population size, $N$, and the annual incidence rate, $I$.\nThe population size is $N = 50 \\times 10^{6}$ persons.\nThe annual incidence is given as $1.5$ cases per $10^{6}$ persons per year. This can be expressed as a per-person rate:\n$$I = \\frac{1.5}{10^{6}} \\text{ cases per person per year}$$\nAccording to the problem's first principle, the expected annual number of cases, $\\lambda$, is the product of the population size and the per-person annual incidence rate.\n$$\\lambda = N \\times I$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\lambda = (50 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ persons}) \\times \\left( \\frac{1.5}{10^{6}} \\frac{\\text{cases}}{\\text{person} \\cdot \\text{year}} \\right)$$\n$$\\lambda = 50 \\times 1.5 \\frac{\\text{cases}}{\\text{year}}$$\n$$\\lambda = 75 \\text{ cases per year}$$\nThe expected annual case count is exactly $75$.\n\n#### Task 2: Construct an approximate central 95% probability interval\nThe annual number of cases, let's call it $X$, is modeled by a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = 75$. So, $X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda=75)$.\nThe problem states that for a sufficiently large $\\lambda$, this distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution. Since $\\lambda=75$ is large (typically $\\lambda > 20$ is considered sufficient), this approximation is appropriate.\nThe approximating normal distribution has a mean $\\mu = \\lambda$ and a variance $\\sigma^2 = \\lambda$.\nTherefore, $X \\approx \\mathcal{N}(\\mu=75, \\sigma^2=75)$.\nThe standard deviation is $\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\lambda} = \\sqrt{75}$.\n\nA central $95\\%$ probability interval for a normal distribution is given by the formula:\n$$[\\mu - z_{\\alpha/2} \\sigma, \\mu + z_{\\alpha/2} \\sigma]$$\nFor a $95\\%$ confidence level, the significance level is $\\alpha = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$. Thus, $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$. The value $z_{0.025}$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution that leaves an area of $0.025$ in the upper tail. This corresponds to the $97.5$-th percentile of the standard normal distribution, which is commonly known to be $z_{0.025} \\approx 1.96$.\n\nThe interval bounds are:\nLower Bound, $L = \\mu - 1.96 \\sigma = 75 - 1.96 \\sqrt{75}$\nUpper Bound, $U = \\mu + 1.96 \\sigma = 75 + 1.96 \\sqrt{75}$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values.\nFirst, calculate the term $1.96\\sqrt{75}$:\n$$\\sqrt{75} = \\sqrt{25 \\times 3} = 5\\sqrt{3} \\approx 8.660254$$\n$$1.96 \\times \\sqrt{75} \\approx 1.96 \\times 8.660254 \\approx 16.974098$$\nNow, calculate the bounds:\n$$L \\approx 75 - 16.974098 \\approx 58.025902$$\n$$U \\approx 75 + 16.974098 \\approx 91.974098$$\n\n#### Task 3: Report the results with specified rounding\nThe problem requires three values to be reported in order: the expected annual case count, the lower interval bound, and the upper interval bound.\n\n1.  **Expected annual case count**: $\\lambda = 75$. This is to be reported exactly.\n2.  **Lower interval bound**: $L \\approx 58.025902$. Rounding to two significant figures, we look at the first two non-zero digits, which are $5$ and $8$. The next digit is $0$, so we round down. The result is $58$.\n3.  **Upper interval bound**: $U \\approx 91.974098$. Rounding to two significant figures, we look at the first two digits, which are $9$ and $1$. The next digit is $9$, so we round the last significant digit up. The result is $92$.\n\nThe final ordered results are $75$, $58$, and $92$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n75 & 58 & 92\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4518903"}, {"introduction": "In the clinical setting, diagnosis is an exercise in updating probabilities based on new evidence.
