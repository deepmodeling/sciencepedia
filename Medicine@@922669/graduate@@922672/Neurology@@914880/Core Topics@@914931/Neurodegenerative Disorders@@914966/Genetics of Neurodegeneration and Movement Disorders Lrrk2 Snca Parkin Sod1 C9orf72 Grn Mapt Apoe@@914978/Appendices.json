The APOE gene and its alleles ($E2$, $E3$, $E4$) are real and extensively studied genetic factors, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. The given allele frequencies are realistic for certain human populations. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information (allele frequencies) and a clear, unambiguous question (calculate a specific genotype frequency). The Hardy-Weinberg equations provide a direct path to a unique solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms.\n- **Internal Consistency:** A check of the allele frequencies confirms their consistency: $f(E2) + f(E3) + f(E4) = 0.08 + 0.76 + 0.16 = 1.00$. The sum is exactly $1$, as required for allele frequencies at a single locus.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected proportion of individuals with the homozygous genotype $E4/E4$ in a population that is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The Hardy-Weinberg principle describes the relationship between allele frequencies and genotype frequencies in such a population.\n\nFor a locus with multiple alleles, the principle can be generalized. Let the alleles be $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_k$ with corresponding frequencies $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k$, such that $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} p_i = 1$. Under the assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (large population, random mating, no mutation, no migration, no selection), the expected frequency of any homozygous genotype $A_i/A_i$ is the square of the corresponding allele's frequency, $p_i^2$. The expected frequency of any heterozygous genotype $A_i/A_j$ (where $i \\neq j$) is $2p_i p_j$.\n\nIn this specific problem, we are considering the APOE locus with three alleles: $E2$, $E3$, and $E4$. Let their frequencies be denoted by $p_2$, $p_3$, and $p_4$, respectively.\nThe given allele frequencies are:\n- $p_2 = f(E2) = 0.08$\n- $p_3 = f(E3) = 0.76$\n- $p_4 = f(E4) = 0.16$\n\nWe are asked to find the expected proportion (frequency) of individuals who are homozygous for the $E4$ allele, which corresponds to the genotype $E4/E4$.\n\nUsing the Hardy-Weinberg principle, the frequency of the $E4/E4$ genotype, denoted as $f(E4/E4)$, is calculated by squaring the frequency of the $E4$ allele:\n$$f(E4/E4) = (p_4)^2$$\n\nSubstituting the given value for the frequency of the $E4$ allele:\n$$f(E4/E4) = (0.16)^2$$\n\nNow, we perform the calculation:\n$$f(E4/E4) = 0.16 \\times 0.16 = 0.0256$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.0256$ has three significant figures (the digits $2$, $5$, and $6$; leading zeros are not significant). To express this value with four significant figures, we must add a trailing zero.\nTherefore, the proportion is $0.02560$.

The problem specifies that the marginal totals of the contingency table are to be considered fixed. This condition corresponds to the assumptions of the hypergeometric distribution.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis ($H_0$) of no association, the probability of observing a particular set of cell counts ($a, b, c, d$) given the fixed marginals is given by the hypergeometric probability mass function:\n$$ P(a, b, c, d | H_0) = \\frac{\\binom{a+c}{a}\\binom{b+d}{b}}{\\binom{N}{a+b}} = \\frac{(a+c)!(b+d)!(a+b)!(c+d)!}{N! a! b! c! d!} $$\nLet $X$ be a random variable representing the count in cell 'a' (number of PRKN carriers in the case group). We can express the probability of observing $k$ such individuals as:\n$$ P(X=k) = \\frac{\\binom{K}{k}\\binom{N-K}{n-k}}{\\binom{N}{n}} $$\nwhere:\n- $N = 2000$ is the total population size (total individuals).\n- $K = a+b = 42$ is the total number of individuals with the exposure (biallelic PRKN).\n- $n = a+c = 1000$ is the sample size of the group of interest (cases).\n- $k$ is the number of exposed individuals in the group of interest.\n\nThe problem asks for the one-sided (greater tail) $p$-value for observing at least the given enrichment of PRKN variants in cases. This means we must calculate the probability of observing the current table or any table that is more extreme in the direction of enrichment. The observed value for cell 'a' is $40$. More extreme tables would have values of $a > 40$. The maximum possible value for 'a' is $\\min(a+b, a+c) = \\min(42, 1000) = 42$.\n\nTherefore, the $p$-value is the sum of the probabilities for $a=40$, $a=41$, and $a=42$:\n$$ p = P(X \\ge 40) = P(X=40) + P(X=41) + P(X=42) $$\nThis can be written explicitly using the hypergeometric formula:\n$$ p = \\sum_{k=40}^{42} \\frac{\\binom{42}{k}\\binom{2000-42}{1000-k}}{\\binom{2000}{1000}} = \\sum_{k=40}^{42} \\frac{\\binom{42}{k}\\binom{1958}{1000-k}}{\\binom{2000}{1000}} $$\nThe terms in the sum are:\n1. For $k=40$: The observed table $(a=40, b=2, c=960, d=998)$.\n   $$ P(X=40) = \\frac{\\binom{42}{40}\\binom{1958}{960}}{\\binom{2000}{1000}} $$\n2.

Real-time qPCR quantifies nucleic acid by monitoring fluorescence during amplification; the cycle threshold (Cₜ) is defined as the number of amplification cycles required for fluorescence to cross a fixed threshold. Under the assumption of perfect amplification efficiency, each polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle doubles the quantity of amplicon. The delta method uses within-sample normalization to a reference gene, defining the normalized threshold as $\\Delta C_{t} \\equiv C_{t,\\mathrm{target}} - C_{t,\\mathrm{reference}}$.

It describes a standard application of Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) for gene copy number variation analysis. The provided definitions and assumptions are sufficient to derive the requested quantities.\n\nThe core principle of qPCR under perfect amplification efficiency is that the quantity of a specific DNA sequence, or amplicon, doubles with each cycle. Let $N_0$ be the initial number of copies of a target sequence and $N_C$ be the number of copies after $C$ cycles. The relationship is given by:\n$$N_C = N_0 \\cdot 2^C$$\n\nThe cycle threshold, $C_t$, is the cycle number at which the amount of amplified DNA, monitored by fluorescence, crosses a fixed threshold level, $N_{threshold}$. At this point, for a given reaction, we have:\n$$N_{threshold} = N_0 \\cdot 2^{C_t}$$\n\nThis equation can be rearranged to express the initial quantity $N_0$ as a function of the measured $C_t$ value:\n$$N_0 = N_{threshold} \\cdot 2^{-C_t}$$\nThis relationship shows that a higher initial quantity $N_0$ corresponds to a lower $C_t$ value, as fewer cycles are needed to reach the threshold.\n\nThe problem involves a target gene ($SNCA$, denoted by subscript $T$) and a reference gene (subscript $R$), analyzed in a proband or sample (subscript $S$) and a diploid control (subscript $C$). We can write four equations for the initial quantities of these genes in the respective individuals:\n1.  Target gene in the sample: $N_{0,T,S} = N_{threshold} \\cdot 2^{-C_{t,T,S}}$\n2.  Reference gene in the sample: $N_{0,R,S} = N_{threshold} \\cdot 2^{-C_{t,R,S}}$\n3.  Target gene in the control: $N_{0,T,C} = N_{threshold} \\cdot 2^{-C_{t,T,C}}$\n4.  Reference gene in the control: $N_{0,R,C} = N_{threshold} \\cdot 2^{-C_{t,R,C}}$\n\nWe assume that the amplification efficiency is perfect ($E=2$) and that the fluorescence threshold $N_{threshold}$ is constant across all reactions, as is standard for this method.\n\nThe $\\Delta C_t$ method normalizes the quantity of the target gene to the quantity of the reference gene within each individual. The ratio of initial target to reference molecules in the sample is:\n$$\\frac{N_{0,T,S}}{N_{0,R,S}} = \\frac{N_{threshold} \\cdot 2^{-C_{t,T,S}}}{N_{threshold} \\cdot 2^{-C_{t,R,S}}} = 2^{-C_{t,T,S} + C_{t,R,S}} = 2^{-(C_{t,T,S} - C_{t,R,S})}$$\nUsing the problem's definition, $\\Delta C_{t,\\mathrm{sample}} \\equiv C_{t,T,S} - C_{t,R,S}$, this ratio becomes:\n$$\\frac{N_{0,T,S}}{N_{0,R,S}} = 2^{-\\Delta C_{t,\\mathrm{sample}}}$$\n\nSimilarly, for the control:\n$$\\frac{N_{0,T,C}}{N_{0,R,C}} = 2^{-(C_{t,T,C} - C_{t,R,C})} = 2^{-\\Delta C_{t,\\mathrm{control}}}$$\nwhere $\\Delta C_{t,\\mathrm{control}} \\equiv C_{t,T,C} - C_{t,R,C}$.\n\nThe relative gene dosage, $D$, is the fold-change of the normalized target gene quantity in the sample relative to the normalized quantity in the control.

The calculated value of $1.741$ is higher than the idealized value of $1.5$. However, it is in the expected direction (a value greater than $1$ indicates gain) and of a similar magnitude.
