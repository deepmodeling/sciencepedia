Assume the head and the upper torso are two rigid bodies coupled by a torsional spring and damper representing neck stiffness and neuromuscular damping, respectively. The goal is to compute the peak head angular acceleration for specified scenarios using a numerical integration of the governing equations derived from first principles.

Let $\\theta_{\\text{head}}(t)$ and $\\theta_{\\text{torso}}(t)$ denote angular positions of the head and torso, respectively. Their derivatives are angular velocities $\\dot{\\theta}_{\\text{head}}(t)$ and $\\dot{\\theta}_{\\text{torso}}(t)$. Moments of inertia are $I_{\\text{head}}$ and $I_{\\text{torso}}$. The neck is modeled as a linear torsional spring–damper with stiffness $k$ and damping $c$. An external impact torque $\\tau_{\\text{ext}}(t)$ is applied to the torso as a half-sine pulse with peak $\\tau_0$ and duration $T$.\n\nStep 2: Apply Newton’s second law for rotation to each rigid body. For the head, the only torque arises from the neck coupling, acting opposite to the direction of relative displacement and velocity. The neck torque transmitted between bodies is\n$$\\tau_{\\text{neck}} = k \\, (\\theta_{\\text{head}} - \\theta_{\\text{torso}}) + c \\, (\\dot{\\theta}_{\\text{head}} - \\dot{\\theta}_{\\text{torso}}).$$\nThe head’s equation is then\n$$I_{\\text{head}} \\, \\ddot{\\theta}_{\\text{head}} = -\\tau_{\\text{neck}}.$$\nFor the torso, the net torque includes the external impact torque plus the neck torque acting on the torso in the opposite direction to that on the head:\n$$I_{\\text{torso}} \\, \\ddot{\\theta}_{\\text{torso}} = \\tau_{\\text{ext}}(t) + \\tau_{\\text{neck}}.$$\n\nStep 3: Convert to a first-order system for numerical integration. Define the state vector\n$$\\mathbf{x}(t) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\theta_{\\text{head}}(t) \\\\ \\dot{\\theta}_{\\text{head}}(t) \\\\ \\theta_{\\text{torso}}(t) \\\\ \\dot{\\theta}_{\\text{torso}}(t) \\end{bmatrix}.$$\nUsing the above, the time derivatives are\n\\begin{align*}\n\\dot{\\theta}_{\\text{head}} &= \\dot{\\theta}_{\\text{head}}, \\\\\n\\ddot{\\theta}_{\\text{head}} &= -\\dfrac{1}{I_{\\text{head}}}\\left[k \\, (\\theta_{\\text{head}} - \\theta_{\\text{torso}}) + c \\, (\\dot{\\theta}_{\\text{head}} - \\dot{\\theta}_{\\text{torso}})\\right], \\\\\n\\dot{\\theta}_{\\text{torso}} &= \\dot{\\theta}_{\\text{torso}}, \\\\\n\\ddot{\\theta}_{\\text{torso}} &= \\dfrac{1}{I_{\\text{torso}}}\\left[\\tau_{\\text{ext}}(t) + k \\, (\\theta_{\\text{head}} - \\theta_{\\text{torso}}) + c \\, (\\dot{\\theta}_{\\text{head}} - \\dot{\\theta}_{\\text{torso}})\\right].\n\\end{align*}\nThis system can be integrated using a constant step fourth-order Runge–Kutta method to ensure accuracy over the short-duration impact.\n\nStep 4: Define the external torque input.

At each integration step, compute\n$$\\ddot{\\theta}_{\\text{head}}(t) = -\\dfrac{1}{I_{\\text{head}}}\\left[k \\, (\\theta_{\\text{head}}(t) - \\theta_{\\text{torso}}(t)) + c \\, (\\dot{\\theta}_{\\text{head}}(t) - \\dot{\\theta}_{\\text{torso}}(t))\\right],$$\nand track the maximum absolute value over the integration interval. This peak absolute head angular acceleration, expressed in radians per second squared, is the scalar metric to report for each test case.\n\nStep 7: Test suite coverage and expectations. The five cases span a baseline, increased stiffness, very high stiffness with increased damping, low stiffness with low damping, and a zero-input boundary condition. The increased stiffness cases are expected to reduce relative head–torso motion and often reduce peak head angular acceleration transmitted through the neck due to increased coupling, while low stiffness may allow larger relative motion and potentially larger accelerations. The zero-input case should produce a peak of $0$.\n\nStep 8: Output formatting.

Starting from Bayes’ theorem and core definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios, first compute the pretest probability $p_{\\text{pre}}$ for this athlete and then update to the posterior probability $p_{\\text{post}}$ after observing the two positive biomarker results. Express the final updated probability $p_{\\text{post}}$ as a decimal and round your answer to four significant figures. No units are required.", "solution": "The problem asks to calculate the posterior probability of an athlete having Traumatic Encephalopathy Syndrome (TES) given their clinical history and two positive biomarker results. The process involves two main steps: 1) calculating the pretest probability using the provided logistic regression model, and 2) updating this probability using Bayes' theorem in its odds-likelihood ratio form.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Pretest Probability ($p_{\\text{pre}}$)**\nThe pretest log-odds (logit) of TES is calculated using the given logistic model:\n$$ \\text{logit}(p_{\\text{pre}}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Y + \\beta_2 C + \\beta_3 s_{\\text{cog}} + \\beta_4 s_{\\text{mood}} $$\nSubstituting the athlete's data and model coefficients:\n- $Y = 12$ years of play\n- $C = 4$ concussions\n- $s_{\\text{cog}} = 1.3$\n- $s_{\\text{mood}} = 1.1$\n- $\\beta_0 = -3.0$, $\\beta_1 = 0.05$, $\\beta_2 = 0.25$, $\\beta_3 = 0.60$, $\\beta_4 = 0.45$\n\n$$ \\text{logit}(p_{\\text{pre}}) = -3.0 + (0.05)(12) + (0.25)(4) + (0.60)(1.3) + (0.45)(1.1) $$\n$$ \\text{logit}(p_{\\text{pre}}) = -3.0 + 0.6 + 1.0 + 0.78 + 0.495 = -0.125 $$\n\nThe pretest odds are the exponential of the log-odds:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\exp(-0.125) $$\n\nThe pretest probability is then found by converting the odds back to probability:\n$$ p_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}}} = \\frac{\\exp(-0.125)}{1 + \\exp(-0.125)} \\approx 0.46879 $$\n\n**Step 2: Update to Posterior Probability ($p_{\\text{post}}$)**\nWe use the odds form of Bayes' theorem: $\\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Pretest Odds} \\times \\text{Likelihood Ratio}$.\nFirst, we calculate the positive likelihood ratio ($LR^+$) for each test, where $LR^+ = \\frac{\\text{Sensitivity}}{1 - \\text{Specificity}}$.\n\nFor the p-tau$181$ test:\n- Sensitivity $Se_1 = 0.72$\n- Specificity $Sp_1 = 0.82$\n$$ LR_1^+ = \\frac{0.72}{1 - 0.82} = \\frac{0.72}{0.18} = 4.0 $$\n\nFor the tau-PET test:\n- Sensitivity $Se_2 = 0.85$\n- Specificity $Sp_2 = 0.90$\n$$ LR_2^+ = \\frac{0.85}{1 - 0.90} = \\frac{0.85}{0.10} = 8.5 $$\n\nSince the tests are conditionally independent, the combined likelihood ratio for two positive results is the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$ LR_{\\text{combined}}^+ = LR_1^+ \\times LR_2^+ = 4.0 \\times 8.5 = 34.0 $$\n\nNow, we calculate the posterior odds:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR_{\\text{combined}}^+ = \\exp(-0.125) \\times 34.0 $$\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.8824969 \\times 34.0 \\approx 30.004895 $$\n\nFinally, we convert the posterior odds to the posterior probability:\n$$ p_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}} = \\frac{30.004895}{1 + 30.004895} \\approx \\frac{30.004895}{31.004895} \\approx 0.967746 $$\n\nRounding the final result to four significant figures gives $0.9677$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9677}\n$$", "id": "4469640"}]}
