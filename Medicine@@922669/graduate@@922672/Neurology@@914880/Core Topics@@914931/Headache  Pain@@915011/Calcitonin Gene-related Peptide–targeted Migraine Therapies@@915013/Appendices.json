The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem describes a system at equilibrium involving a receptor ($R$), an agonist ($G$), and a competitive antagonist ($E$). The interactions are governed by the law of mass action.\n\nThe binding equilibria are:\n1.  Agonist binding: $R + G \\rightleftharpoons RG$\n2.  Antagonist binding: $R + E \\rightleftharpoons RE$\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constants are defined as:\n$$K_{d,G} = \\frac{[R][G]}{[RG]}$$\n$$K_{d,E} = \\frac{[R][E]}{[RE]}$$\nwhere $[R]$, $[G]$, $[E]$, $[RG]$, and $[RE]$ are the molar concentrations of free receptor, free agonist, free antagonist, agonist-receptor complex, and antagonist-receptor complex, respectively.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R_{tot}]$, is the sum of the concentrations of all receptor states:\n$$[R_{tot}] = [R] + [RG] + [RE]$$\nWe can express $[RG]$ and $[RE]$ in terms of $[R]$ using the dissociation constant definitions:\n$$[RG] = \\frac{[R][G]}{K_{d,G}}$$\n$$[RE] = \\frac{[R][E]}{K_{d,E}}$$\nSubstituting these into the receptor conservation equation gives:\n$$[R_{tot}] = [R] + \\frac{[R][G]}{K_{d,G}} + \\frac{[R][E]}{K_{d,E}} = [R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}} + \\frac{[E]}{K_{d,E}} \\right)$$\n\nThe first objective is to compute the fraction of receptors occupied by the antagonist erenumab, which we denote as $f_{RE}$.\n$$f_{RE} = \\frac{[RE]}{[R_{tot}]} = \\frac{\\frac{[R][E]}{K_{d,E}}}{[R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}} + \\frac{[E]}{K_{d,E}} \\right)}$$\n$$f_{RE} = \\frac{\\frac{[E]}{K_{d,E}}}{1 + \\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}} + \\frac{[E]}{K_{d,E}}}$$\n\nThe second objective is to compute the fractional inhibition of CGRP signaling. The problem states that the response is directly proportional to agonist occupancy. Let $f_{RG}$ be the fraction of receptors occupied by the agonist CGRP.\n$$f_{RG} = \\frac{[RG]}{[R_{tot}]} = \\frac{\\frac{[R][G]}{K_{d,G}}}{[R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}} + \\frac{[E]}{K_{d,E}} \\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}}}{1 + \\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}} + \\frac{[E]}{K_{d,E}}}$$\nThis is the fractional occupancy by agonist in the presence of the antagonist.\n\nThe response in the agonist-alone condition (i.e., $[E]=0$) is proportional to the agonist occupancy in that condition, $f_{RG,0}$.\n$$f_{RG,0} = \\frac{\\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}}}{1 + \\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}}}$$\nFractional inhibition, $I$, is the reduction in response relative to the response in the absence of the antagonist.\n$$I = \\frac{\\text{Response}_0 - \\text{Response}_E}{\\text{Response}_0}$$\nSince response is proportional to agonist occupancy, this becomes:\n$$I = \\frac{f_{RG,0} - f_{RG}}{f_{RG,0}} = 1 - \\frac{f_{RG}}{f_{RG,0}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $f_{RG}$ and $f_{RG,0}$:\n$$I = 1 - \\frac{\\frac{\\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}}}{1 + \\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}} + \\frac{[E]}{K_{d,E}}}}{\\frac{\\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}}}{1 + \\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}}}} = 1 - \\frac{1 + \\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}}}{1 + \\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}} + \\frac{[E]}{K_{d,E}}}$$\n$$I = \\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}} + \\frac{[E]}{K_{d,E}}\\right) - \\left(1 + \\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}}\\right)}{1 + \\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}} + \\frac{[E]}{K_{d,E}}}$$\n$$I = \\frac{\\frac{[E]}{K_{d,E}}}{1 + \\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}} + \\frac{[E]}{K_{d,E}}}$$\nThis result demonstrates that, under the given assumptions for a neutral competitive antagonist, the fractional inhibition of the agonist response is identical to the fractional occupancy of the receptor by the antagonist ($I = f_{RE}$). Thus, we only need to compute one value.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $[G] = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_{d,G} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{M}$\n- $[E] = 1.5 \\times 10^{-8} \\,\\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_{d,E} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\mathrm{M}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless concentration ratios:\n$$\\frac{[G]}{K_{d,G}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{M}}{3.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n$$\\frac{[E]}{K_{d,E}} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-8} \\,\\mathrm{M}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^2}{2.0} = \\frac{150}{2} = 75$$\nNow we substitute these ratios into the derived formula for $f_{RE}$ and $I$:\n$$f_{RE} = I = \\frac{75}{1 + \\frac{1}{3} + 75} = \\frac{75}{76 + \\frac{1}{3}}$$\nTo simplify the denominator:\n$$76 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{76 \\times 3}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{228 + 1}{3} = \\frac{229}{3}$$\nNow, we compute the final fraction:\n$$f_{RE} = I = \\frac{75}{\\frac{229}{3}} = \\frac{75 \\times 3}{229} = \\frac{225}{229}$$\nThe fraction of receptors occupied by erenumab is $\\frac{225}{229}$. The resulting fractional inhibition of CGRP signaling is also $\\frac{225}{229}$.\n\nThe number $229$ is a prime number, and $225 = 3^2 \\times 5^2$, so the fraction is in its simplest form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{225}{229}}$$", "id": "4459719"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the drug's action at the receptor, its fate and persistence within the body—its pharmacokinetics—are critical for therapeutic success.

I will now proceed to provide a complete solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the half-life ($t_{1/2}$) from first principles, specifically the mass balance of the drug in a one-compartment model.\n\nThe rate of change of the amount of drug, $A(t)$, in the body is described by the mass balance equation. For the disposition (elimination-only) phase, there is no drug administration, so the rate of change of $A(t)$ is equal to the negative of the elimination rate.\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -(\\text{Elimination Rate})\n$$\nThe problem states that the elimination is a first-order process, with the rate given by $CL \\cdot C(t)$.\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nWe are also given the relationship between the amount of drug $A(t)$, its plasma concentration $C(t)$, and the volume of distribution $V$:\n$$\nA(t) = V \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nAssuming the volume of distribution $V$ is a constant, we can differentiate this expression with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\frac{dA(t)}{dt}$ yields a differential equation for the concentration $C(t)$:\n$$\nV \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. It can be solved by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{C(t)} = -\\frac{CL}{V} dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides. The integration is performed from the initial time $t=0$, where the concentration is $C(0)$, to a general time $t$, where the concentration is $C(t)$.\n$$\n\\int_{C(0)}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C'} dC' = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\frac{CL}{V} dt'\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals gives:\n$$\n[\\ln(C')]_{C(0)}^{C(t)} = \\left[-\\frac{CL}{V} t'\\right]_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C(0)) = -\\frac{CL}{V} t\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can write this as:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C(0)}\\right) = -\\frac{CL}{V} t\n$$\nTo find an explicit expression for $C(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\nC(t) = C(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V} t\\right)\n$$\nThis equation describes the exponential decay of the drug concentration over time. The half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time at which the concentration falls to half of its initial value, i.e., $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{C(0)}{2}$. We substitute this definition into the concentration equation:\n$$\n\\frac{C(0)}{2} = C(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V} t_{1/2}\\right)\n$$\nDividing by $C(0)$ (which is non-zero) yields:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{CL}{V} t_{1/2}\\right)\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{CL}{V} t_{1/2}\n$$\nSince $\\ln(1/2) = -\\ln(2)$, we have:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -\\frac{CL}{V} t_{1/2}\n$$\nThis gives the derived expression for half-life:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{V \\ln(2)}{CL}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.

The volume of distribution $V$ remains unchanged. The clearance, $CL$, increases by $60\\%$. Let's denote the new clearance as $CL_{\\mathrm{ADA}}$.\n$$\nCL_{\\mathrm{ADA}} = CL_{\\mathrm{baseline}} + 0.60 \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{baseline}} = (1 + 0.60) \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{baseline}} = 1.60 \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{baseline}}\n$$\nThe new half-life, $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{ADA}}$, is given by the same derived formula, but with the new clearance value:\n$$\nt_{1/2,\\mathrm{ADA}} = \\frac{V \\ln(2)}{CL_{\\mathrm{ADA}}} = \\frac{V \\ln(2)}{1.60 \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{baseline}}}\n$$\nWe need to find the dimensionless ratio $\\frac{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{ADA}}}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{baseline}}}$.\n$$\n\\frac{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{ADA}}}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{baseline}}} = \\frac{\\frac{V \\ln(2)}{1.60 \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{baseline}}}}{\\frac{V \\ln(2)}{CL_{\\mathrm{baseline}}}}\n$$\nThe terms $V$, $\\ln(2)$, and $CL_{\\mathrm{baseline}}$ cancel out, simplifying the expression significantly:\n$$\n\\frac{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{ADA}}}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{baseline}}} = \\frac{1}{1.60}\n$$\nNow we compute the numerical value of this ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1.60} = 0.625\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
