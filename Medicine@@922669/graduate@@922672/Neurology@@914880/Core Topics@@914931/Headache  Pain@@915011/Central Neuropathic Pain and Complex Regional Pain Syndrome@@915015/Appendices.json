Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA$_{\\text{A}}$) currents are primarily carried by chloride and therefore depend on the chloride equilibrium potential. Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) involves central sensitization mechanisms that can similarly alter inhibitory control, motivating a quantitative assessment of chloride electrochemical equilibrium and GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ current direction under impaired KCC2 function.\n\nStarting from first principles, use the equality of electrochemical potentials at equilibrium to derive the chloride equilibrium potential $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ for a monovalent anion of valence $z=-1$ at absolute temperature $T$, where the electrochemical potential is $\\mu + z F \\phi$ and the chemical potential in solution is $\\mu^{0} + R T \\ln a$ (with $a$ proportional to concentration for ideal dilute solutions).

There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts: first, the derivation of the chloride equilibrium potential ($E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$) from first principles; second, the calculation of $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ for the specified conditions; and third, the calculation of the GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ current ($I_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$) and its physiological interpretation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Chloride Equilibrium Potential ($E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$)**\n\nThe electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}$, for an ionic species is the sum of its chemical potential, $\\mu$, and the potential energy associated with its charge in an electric field, $z F \\phi$.\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu} = \\mu + z F \\phi $$\nwhere $z$ is the ion's valence, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $\\phi$ is the local electric potential. The chemical potential in a solution is given by:\n$$ \\mu = \\mu^{0} + R T \\ln a $$\nwhere $\\mu^{0}$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $a$ is the chemical activity of the ion.\n\nAt equilibrium, there is no net flux of the ion across the membrane. This condition is met when the electrochemical potential of the ion is equal on both sides of the membrane (intracellular, 'in', and extracellular, 'out'). For the chloride ion ($\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$), we have:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Cl, in}} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Cl, out}} $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for electrochemical and chemical potential:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^{0} + R T \\ln a_{\\mathrm{in}} + z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} F \\phi_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^{0} + R T \\ln a_{\\mathrm{out}} + z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} F \\phi_{\\mathrm{out}} $$\n\nThe standard chemical potential $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^{0}$ is identical on both sides and cancels. Rearranging the terms to solve for the electric potential difference across the membrane, $\\Delta\\phi = \\phi_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\phi_{\\mathrm{out}}$, which is defined as the equilibrium potential for the ion, $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$:\n$$ z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} F (\\phi_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\phi_{\\mathrm{out}}) = R T \\ln a_{\\mathrm{out}} - R T \\ln a_{\\mathrm{in}} $$\n$$ z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} F E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = R T \\ln \\left( \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{out}}}{a_{\\mathrm{in}}} \\right) $$\n\nSolving for $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ gives the general form of the Nernst equation:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = \\frac{R T}{z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{out}}}{a_{\\mathrm{in}}} \\right) $$\n\nFor ideal dilute solutions, activity ($a$) is directly proportional to concentration, so the ratio of activities can be replaced by the ratio of concentrations. For chloride, the valence is $z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = -1$. Substituting these into the equation yields the specific form of the Nernst equation for chloride:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = \\frac{R T}{(-1) F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}}}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}}} \\right) = - \\frac{R T}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}}}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}}} \\right) $$\nThis expression can also be written by inverting the argument of the logarithm:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = \\frac{R T}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}}}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}}} \\right) $$\nThis derived expression will be used for the subsequent calculations.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$**\n\nFirst, we calculate the value of the term $\\frac{RT}{F}$ using the provided constants:\n$R = 8.314\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, $T = 310\\ \\mathrm{K}$, and $F = 96485\\ \\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n$$ \\frac{RT}{F} = \\frac{(8.314\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1})(310\\ \\mathrm{K})}{96485\\ \\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}} \\approx 0.02671\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{C}^{-1} = 0.02671\\ \\mathrm{V} = 26.71\\ \\mathrm{mV} $$\n\nNow, we compute $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ for both the baseline and KCC2 downregulated states.\n\nFor the baseline state:\n$[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in,base}} = 5\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ and $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}} = 130\\ \\mathrm{mM}$.\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{Cl,base}} = (26.71\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{130}\\right) \\approx (26.71\\ \\mathrm{mV})(-3.258) \\approx -87.0\\ \\mathrm{mV} $$\n\nFor the KCC2 downregulated state:\n$[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in,down}} = 20\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ and $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}} = 130\\ \\mathrm{mM}$.\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{Cl,down}} = (26.71\\ \\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{20}{130}\\right) \\approx (26.71\\ \\mathrm{mV})(-1.8718) \\approx -50.00\\ \\mathrm{mV} $$\nThe KCC2 downregulation causes a depolarizing shift in the chloride equilibrium potential from $-87.0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ to $-50.00\\ \\mathrm{mV}$.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation and Interpretation of $I_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$**\n\nThe GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ receptor-mediated current, $I_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$, is modeled by the ohmic relation:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{GABA}} = g_{\\mathrm{GABA}}(V_{m} - E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}) $$\nWe are asked to compute this current for the KCC2 downregulated state. The given parameters are:\n$g_{\\mathrm{GABA}} = 1.5\\ \\mathrm{nS} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{S}$\n$V_{m} = -65\\ \\mathrm{mV} = -0.065\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n$E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = E_{\\mathrm{Cl,down}} \\approx -50.00\\ \\mathrm{mV} = -0.05000\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n\nThe electrochemical driving force on the chloride ions is $(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{Cl}})$.\n$$ V_{m} - E_{\\mathrm{Cl,down}} = -65\\ \\mathrm{mV} - (-50.00\\ \\mathrm{mV}) = -15.0\\ \\mathrm{mV} $$\n\nNow we calculate the current. To obtain the result in picoamperes ($\\mathrm{pA}$), we can multiply conductance in nanosiemens ($\\mathrm{nS}$) by potential in millivolts ($\\mathrm{mV}$), as $(10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{S})(10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V}) = 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{A} = 1\\ \\mathrm{pA}$.\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{GABA}} = (1.5\\ \\mathrm{nS})(-15.0\\ \\mathrm{mV}) = -22.5\\ \\mathrm{pA} $$\nTo be more precise, using the unrounded value for $E_{\\mathrm{Cl,down}}$:\n$E_{\\mathrm{Cl,down}} = -50.004\\ \\mathrm{mV}$\n$V_{m} - E_{\\mathrm{Cl,down}} = -65\\ \\mathrm{mV} - (-50.004\\ \\mathrm{mV}) = -14.996\\ \\mathrm{mV}$\n$I_{\\mathrm{GABA}} = (1.5\\ \\mathrm{nS})(-14.996\\ \\mathrm{mV}) = -22.494\\ \\mathrm{pA}$\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the current is $I_{\\mathrm{GABA}} = -22.5\\ \\mathrm{pA}$.\n\nThe sign of the current $I_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ is negative. By convention, a negative current signifies an inward flow of positive charge or, equivalently, an **outward flow (efflux) of negative charge**. Since the GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ current is carried by $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ anions, a negative $I_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ corresponds to an efflux of $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ from the neuron.\n\nThe efflux of negative ions makes the intracellular space less negative, moving the membrane potential $V_m$ toward a more positive value. This change is defined as **depolarization**.\n\nThis contrasts with the baseline state, where $E_{\\mathrm{Cl,base}} \\approx -87\\ \\mathrm{mV}$, which is hyperpolarized relative to the resting potential of $V_m = -65\\ \\mathrm{mV}$. In that case, GABA$_{\\text{A}}$ channel opening would cause an influx of $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ (positive current), leading to hyperpolarization and inhibition. The KCC2 downregulation thus converts the GABAergic response from inhibitory to depolarizing, which is a key mechanism of central sensitization in the context of neuropathic pain and CRPS.\nThe final computed current is $-22.5\\ \\mathrm{pA}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-22.5}$$", "id": "4463438"}, {"introduction": "The cellular hyperexcitability explored in the previous exercise manifests clinically as distorted sensations, such as pain from a normally non-painful stimulus.

This value, commonly known as a Z-score, quantifies the number of standard deviations a data point is from the population mean. The problem statement provides a definition that directly corresponds to the formula for a Z-score.\n\nLet $x$ represent the patient's raw observation, $\\mu$ be the population mean, and $\\sigma$ be the population standard deviation.

The exact value is $-2.5$. To express this with four significant figures, we must add trailing zeros.\n$$z = -2.500$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret this finding. The clinical criterion for an abnormal finding is a value \"at least $2$ SD from the mean\". This translates to a standardized value whose absolute magnitude is greater than or equal to $2$. Mathematically, this condition is $|z| \\ge 2$.\n\nFor our calculated value:\n$$|z| = |-2.500| = 2.500$$\nSince $2.500 \\ge 2$, the patient's cold pain threshold meets the criterion for an abnormal sensory finding.\n\nThe sign of the $z$-score provides further information.
