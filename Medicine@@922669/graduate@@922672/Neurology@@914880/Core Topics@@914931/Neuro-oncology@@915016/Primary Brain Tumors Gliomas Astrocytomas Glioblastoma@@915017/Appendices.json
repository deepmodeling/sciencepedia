It is scientifically grounded in established principles of enzyme kinetics, mathematically well-posed, and free of contradictions or ambiguities. The premises regarding IDH-mutant glioma, the role of D-2-hydroxyglutarate ($2\\text{-}\\mathrm{HG}$) as a competitive inhibitor of Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) enzymes, and the resulting DNA hypermethylation phenotype are consistent with current biological understanding. The problem provides all necessary parameters and a clear objective. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive and compute the steady-state fraction of methylated cytosines, denoted as $M^\\ast$, based on a kinetic model of methylation and demethylation processes. Let $M(t)$ be the fraction of methylated cytosines at time $t$, where $M(t) \\in [0, 1]$. Consequently, the fraction of unmethylated cytosines is $1 - M(t)$.\n\nThe rate of change of the methylated fraction is given by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = v_{\\mathrm{meth}} - v_{\\mathrm{demeth}}\n$$\nwhere $v_{\\mathrm{meth}}$ is the total methylation flux and $v_{\\mathrm{demeth}}$ is the total demethylation flux.\n\n**1. Formulation of Reaction Fluxes**\n\nThe methylation flux, $v_{\\mathrm{meth}}$, is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and is dependent on the concentration of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine ($[\\mathrm{SAM}]$) and the availability of unmethylated cytosine sites, whose fraction is $1 - M(t)$. We model this using Michaelis-Menten kinetics, where the velocity is proportional to the fraction of available substrate sites:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{meth}} = \\left( V_{\\mathrm{DNMT}}^{\\max} \\frac{[\\mathrm{SAM}]}{K_{\\mathrm{M,SAM}} + [\\mathrm{SAM}]} \\right) \\cdot (1 - M(t))\n$$\nHere, $V_{\\mathrm{DNMT}}^{\\max}$ is the maximum catalytic capacity of DNMT enzymes, and $K_{\\mathrm{M,SAM}}$ is the Michaelis constant for SAM.\n\nThe demethylation flux, $v_{\\mathrm{demeth}}$, is catalyzed by TET enzymes. This reaction is dependent on the concentration of the co-substrate $\\alpha$-ketoglutarate ($[\\alpha\\text{-}\\mathrm{KG}]$) and is competitively inhibited by D-2-hydroxyglutarate ($[2\\text{-}\\mathrm{HG}]$). The reaction acts on methylated cytosine sites, whose fraction is $M(t)$. The velocity is modeled using the equation for competitive inhibition:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{demeth}} = \\left( V_{\\mathrm{TET}}^{\\max} \\frac{[\\alpha\\text{-}\\mathrm{KG}]}{K_{\\mathrm{M,\\alpha KG}}\\left(1 + \\frac{[2\\text{-}\\mathrm{HG}]}{K_i}\\right) + [\\alpha\\text{-}\\mathrm{KG}]} \\right) \\cdot M(t)\n$$\nHere, $V_{\\mathrm{TET}}^{\\max}$ is the maximum catalytic capacity of TET enzymes, $K_{\\mathrm{M,\\alpha KG}}$ is the Michaelis constant for $\\alpha\\text{-}\\mathrm{KG}$, and $K_i$ is the inhibition constant for the competitive inhibitor $2\\text{-}\\mathrm{HG}$.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Steady-State Solution**\n\nAt steady-state, the net rate of change of methylation is zero, i.e., $\\frac{dM}{dt} = 0$. Let $M^\\ast$ denote the steady-state methylation fraction. The steady-state condition is:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{meth}} = v_{\\mathrm{demeth}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the fluxes, we get:\n$$\n\\left( V_{\\mathrm{DNMT}}^{\\max} \\frac{[\\mathrm{SAM}]}{K_{\\mathrm{M,SAM}} + [\\mathrm{SAM}]} \\right) \\cdot (1 - M^\\ast) = \\left( V_{\\mathrm{TET}}^{\\max} \\frac{[\\alpha\\text{-}\\mathrm{KG}]}{K_{\\mathrm{M,\\alpha KG}}\\left(1 + \\frac{[2\\text{-}\\mathrm{HG}]}{K_i}\\right) + [\\alpha\\text{-}\\mathrm{KG}]} \\right) \\cdot M^\\ast\n$$\nTo simplify the algebra, let us define effective first-order rate constants for methylation ($k_{\\mathrm{meth}}$) and demethylation ($k_{\\mathrm{demeth}}$):\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{meth}} = V_{\\mathrm{DNMT}}^{\\max} \\frac{[\\mathrm{SAM}]}{K_{\\mathrm{M,SAM}} + [\\mathrm{SAM}]}\n$$\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{demeth}} = V_{\\mathrm{TET}}^{\\max} \\frac{[\\alpha\\text{-}\\mathrm{KG}]}{K_{\\mathrm{M,\\alpha KG}}\\left(1 + \\frac{[2\\text{-}\\mathrm{HG}]}{K_i}\\right) + [\\alpha\\text{-}\\mathrm{KG}]}\n$$\nThe steady-state equation simplifies to a linear algebraic equation for $M^\\ast$:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{meth}}(1 - M^\\ast) = k_{\\mathrm{demeth}}M^\\ast\n$$\nExpanding the left side gives:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{meth}} - k_{\\mathrm{meth}}M^\\ast = k_{\\mathrm{demeth}}M^\\ast\n$$\nSolving for $M^\\ast$:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{meth}} = (k_{\\mathrm{meth}} + k_{\\mathrm{demeth}})M^\\ast\n$$\n$$\nM^\\ast = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{meth}}}{k_{\\mathrm{meth}} + k_{\\mathrm{demeth}}}\n$$\nThis expression provides the steady-state methylation level as a function of all the given kinetic parameters and substrate/inhibitor concentrations. Since $V^{\\max}$ values are non-negative, the resulting rate constants $k_{\\mathrm{meth}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{demeth}}$ are also non-negative, which guarantees that $0 \\le M^\\ast \\le 1$, consistent with its definition as a fraction.\n\n**3. Computational Implementation**\n\nThe provided program will implement this derived formula. For each test case, the program will:\n1.  Assign the given values to the parameters $V_{\\mathrm{DNMT}}^{\\max}$, $V_{\\mathrm{TET}}^{\\max}$, $K_{\\mathrm{M,SAM}}$, $K_{\\mathrm{M,\\alpha KG}}$, $K_i$, $[\\mathrm{SAM}]$, $[\\alpha\\text{-}\\mathrm{KG}]$, and $[2\\text{-}\\mathrm{HG}]$.\n2.  Calculate the effective rate constants $k_{\\mathrm{meth}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{demeth}}$.\n3.  Compute the steady-state methylation fraction $M^\\ast$ using the derived formula.\n4.

The units for $\\mathrm{ADC}$ will be $\\mathrm{mm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$, consistent with the units of the $b$-value ($\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$).\n\nFor the enhancing solid tumor ROI:\nThe given data are $S_{\\text{tumor}}(0) = 760$ and $S_{\\text{tumor}}(1000) = 378$ at $b = 1000 \\,\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$.\n$$\\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{tumor}} = \\frac{1}{1000} \\ln\\left(\\frac{760}{378}\\right)$$\n$$\\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{tumor}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1000} \\ln(2.010582) \\approx \\frac{0.698433}{1000} \\approx 0.000698433 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nFor the contralateral normal-appearing white matter (NWM) ROI:\nThe given data are $S_{\\text{NWM}}(0) = 820$ and $S_{\\text{NWM}}(1000) = 333$ at $b = 1000 \\,\\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{mm}^{2}$.\n$$\\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{NWM}} = \\frac{1}{1000} \\ln\\left(\\frac{820}{333}\\right)$$\n$$\\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{NWM}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1000} \\ln(2.462462) \\approx \\frac{0.901174}{1000} \\approx 0.000901174 \\,\\mathrm{mm}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$$\nAs expected from biophysical principles, the $\\mathrm{ADC}$ in the highly cellular glioblastoma is lower than in the normal-appearing white matter, reflecting restricted water diffusion.\n\nThe final step is to compute the relative cellularity. The problem defines cellularity, $C$, as being inversely proportional to the $\\mathrm{ADC}$. This can be expressed as:\n$$C = \\frac{k}{\\mathrm{ADC}}$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality. This constant depends on tissue-specific biophysical properties but is assumed to be the same for the comparison.\n\nThe relative cellularity, $C_{\\text{rel}}$, is defined as the ratio of the tumor's cellularity to that of the normal white matter:\n$$C_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{tumor}}}{C_{\\text{NWM}}}$$\nSubstituting the inverse proportionality relationship:\n$$C_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{k / \\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{tumor}}}{k / \\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{NWM}}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{NWM}}}{\\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{tumor}}}$$\nNow we substitute the expressions for $\\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{NWM}}$ and $\\mathrm{ADC}_{\\text{tumor}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1000} \\ln\\left(\\frac{820}{333}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{1000} \\ln\\left(\\frac{760}{378}\\right)} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{820}{333}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{760}{378}\\right)}$$\nUsing the intermediate numerical values:\n$$C_{\\text{rel}} \\approx \\frac{0.901174}{0.698433} \\approx 1.29023$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$C_{\\text{rel}} \\approx 1.29$$\nThis dimensionless number indicates that the cellularity of the glioblastoma tissue in the analyzed ROI is approximately $29\\%$ higher than that of the contralateral normal-appearing white matter, according to this model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.29}$$", "id": "4516688"}]}
