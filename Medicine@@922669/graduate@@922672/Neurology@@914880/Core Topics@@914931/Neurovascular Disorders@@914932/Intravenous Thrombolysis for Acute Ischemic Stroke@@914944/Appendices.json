The patient’s body weight is $72$ kg. According to the approved dosing regimen for alteplase in acute ischemic stroke, dosing is weight-based at $0.9$ mg/kg with a maximum total dose cap of $90$ mg, administered as an intravenous bolus of ten percent of the total dose followed by an infusion of the remainder over $60$ minutes.

Round each quantity to three significant figures. Provide your final answer as a single row matrix containing, in order, the total dose, the bolus dose, and the infusion dose.", "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of clinical parameters for a standard pharmacological calculation. The principles described—weight-based dosing, a maximum dose cap, and a bolus-infusion split—are established and formalized in clinical guidelines for intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke. No scientific flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions are present.\n\nThe solution proceeds by a direct application of the specified clinical algorithm. We will first determine the total dose by calculating the weight-based dose and comparing it against the maximum allowed dose. Subsequently, the bolus and infusion doses will be calculated based on the determined total dose.\n\nLet the patient's body weight be denoted by `$W$`. The given value is `$W = 72$` kg.\nThe weight-based dosing rate is `$D_{\\text{rate}} = 0.9$` mg/kg.\nThe maximum total dose cap is `$D_{\\text{max}} = 90$` mg.\n\nFirst, we calculate the theoretical total dose based on the patient's weight, which we shall call `$D_{\\text{calc}}$`:\n$$D_{\\text{calc}} = W \\times D_{\\text{rate}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$D_{\\text{calc}} = 72 \\text{ kg} \\times 0.9 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} = 64.8 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nNext, we must apply the maximum dose constraint. The actual total dose to be administered, denoted `$D_{\\text{total}}$`, is the lesser of the calculated dose and the maximum dose cap:\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = \\min(D_{\\text{calc}}, D_{\\text{max}})$$\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = \\min(64.8 \\text{ mg}, 90 \\text{ mg}) = 64.8 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures. The value `$64.8$` already has three significant figures. Thus, the total dose is `$64.8$` mg.\n\nThe intravenous bolus dose, denoted `$D_{\\text{bolus}}$`, is specified as ten percent (`$10\\%$`) of the total dose:\n$$D_{\\text{bolus}} = 0.10 \\times D_{\\text{total}}$$\n$$D_{\\text{bolus}} = 0.10 \\times 64.8 \\text{ mg} = 6.48 \\text{ mg}$$\nThis value, `$6.48$`, also has three significant figures. Thus, the bolus dose is `$6.48$` mg.\n\nFinally, the infusion dose, denoted `$D_{\\text{infusion}}$`, is the remainder of the total dose after the bolus is administered. It can be calculated as `$90\\%$` of the total dose or by subtraction:\n$$D_{\\text{infusion}} = D_{\\text{total}} - D_{\\text{bolus}}$$\n$$D_{\\text{infusion}} = 64.8 \\text{ mg} - 6.48 \\text{ mg} = 58.32 \\text{ mg}$$\nWe must round this value to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are `$5$`, `$8$`, and `$3$`. The fourth digit is `$2$`, which is less than `$5$`, so we round down.\n$$D_{\\text{infusion}} \\approx 58.3 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nTherefore, the three required quantities, rounded to three significant figures, are:\n- Total alteplase dose: `$64.8$` mg.\n- Bolus dose: `$6.48$` mg.\n- Infusion dose: `$58.3$` mg.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n64.8  6.48  58.3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4487600"}, {"introduction": "Beyond correct dosing, the decision to treat requires a rigorous assessment of patient eligibility, balancing the potential for benefit against the risk of harm. A key part of this assessment involves understanding and applying contraindications, which are rooted in pathophysiology. This problem [@problem_id:4487496] challenges you to explain the critical interaction between warfarin-induced coagulopathy, quantified by the International Normalized Ratio ($INR$), and alteplase-induced fibrinolysis, and to apply this reasoning to a patient case by formalizing the decision-making process.", "problem": "A patient with acute ischemic stroke presents within the therapeutic time window for Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator (rt-PA, alteplase). The patient is chronically anticoagulated with warfarin for atrial fibrillation. The following foundational facts and definitions are available for decision-making about intravenous thrombolysis: (i) International Normalized Ratio (INR) is defined by $INR=(\\frac{PT_{\\text{patient}}}{PT_{\\text{normal}}})^{ISI}$ and reflects the intensity of anticoagulation via suppression of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors in the extrinsic and common coagulation pathways; (ii) alteplase catalyzes conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, accelerating fibrinolysis and degrading fibrin; (iii) excessively impaired coagulation increases the probability of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage when coupled with fibrinolysis; and (iv) widely used, evidence-based exclusion criteria for intravenous alteplase consider warfarin-treated patients ineligible when $INR1.7$ and patients with thrombocytopenia ineligible when platelet count is below $100{,}000/\\mu\\text{L}$. The patient’s laboratory values just prior to consideration of thrombolysis are $INR=1.6$ and platelet count $P=220\\times10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}$. The neurological examination reveals a disabling deficit (for concreteness, assume National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) $=8$ with aphasia), and all other standard contraindications are absent.\n\nStarting from the interaction between warfarin-induced hypocoagulability quantified by $INR$ and alteplase-induced fibrinolysis, explain why $INR1.7$ in the setting of warfarin therapy constitutes a contraindication to intravenous alteplase administration. Then, formalize a binary eligibility indicator $E$ for alteplase as a product of logically justified criteria reflecting hemostatic adequacy and disabling deficit, and compute $E$ for the given patient values of $INR=1.6$, $P=220\\times10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}$, and the presence of a disabling deficit.\n\nExpress the final eligibility indicator as a unitless number. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of stroke neurology and coagulation physiology, provides all necessary data for a logical deduction, and is free of ambiguity or contradiction.\n\nThe problem asks for two parts: first, an explanation of the contraindication for intravenous alteplase when the International Normalized Ratio ($INR$) exceeds $1.7$ in a patient on warfarin, and second, the formalization and calculation of a binary eligibility indicator for a specific patient.\n\nPart 1: Explanation of the $INR  1.7$ Contraindication\n\nHemostasis, the physiological process that stops bleeding, relies on a delicate equilibrium between pro-coagulant and anti-coagulant factors, as well as fibrinolytic and anti-fibrinolytic systems. A key component of a stable blood clot is a mesh of fibrin polymers.\n\nWarfarin is an anticoagulant that functions by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. As stated in the problem, this affects the extrinsic and common pathways of the coagulation cascade. The $INR$, defined as $INR=(\\frac{PT_{\\text{patient}}}{PT_{\\text{normal}}})^{ISI}$, quantifies the degree of this induced hypocoagulability. A higher $INR$ signifies a greater impairment of the blood's ability to form clots.\n\nAlteplase (rt-PA) is a fibrinolytic agent. Its mechanism of action, as given, is to catalyze the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin is a potent enzyme that degrades fibrin, thereby dissolving existing blood clots. This action is the therapeutic basis for its use in acute ischemic stroke, where the goal is to dissolve the thrombus occluding a cerebral artery.\n\nThe administration of a powerful fibrinolytic agent like alteplase to a patient with a pre-existing coagulopathy presents a significant synergistic risk. The patient's ability to form new clots is already compromised by warfarin, as indicated by an elevated $INR$. Simultaneously, alteplase is actively degrading fibrin, which is essential not only for the pathologic thrombus but also for maintaining vascular integrity throughout the body, particularly in the brain, which is susceptible to hemorrhagic transformation after an ischemic insult.\n\nIf the baseline coagulation system is too impaired (i.e., if the $INR$ is too high), the systemic lytic state induced by alteplase can overwhelm the body's compromised hemostatic defenses. This leads to a substantially increased risk of bleeding complications. The most feared of these is symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), a catastrophic event with high morbidity and mortality. The statement \"excessively impaired coagulation increases the probability of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage when coupled with fibrinolysis\" directly summarizes this interaction.\n\nThe specific threshold of $INR1.7$ is not a theoretical construct but an evidence-based cutoff derived from major clinical trials of thrombolysis. These studies demonstrated that for patients on warfarin with an $INR$ above this level, the risk of sICH was unacceptably high and outweighed the potential benefits of reperfusion. Therefore, $INR  1.7$ serves as a critical safety exclusion criterion to mitigate the risk of life-threatening iatrogenic hemorrhage.\n\nPart 2: Formalization and Calculation of the Eligibility Indicator\n\nThe problem requires the formalization of a binary eligibility indicator, $E$, as a product of logically justified criteria. A binary indicator takes the value $1$ for \"true\" (eligible) and $0$ for \"false\" (ineligible). A product ensures that all criteria must be met for eligibility. If any single criterion evaluates to $0$, the overall eligibility $E$ becomes $0$.\n\nBased on the problem statement, we can identify three essential criteria for this patient:\n$1$. The presence of a disabling deficit, which is the primary indication for treatment. Let this be $C_{deficit}$.\n$2$. An acceptable level of anticoagulation from warfarin, defined by $INR \\le 1.7$. Let this be $C_{INR}$.\n$3$. An adequate platelet count for primary hemostasis, defined by platelet count $P \\ge 100{,}000/\\mu\\text{L}$. Let this be $C_{platelet}$.\n\nWe can formalize these as binary functions:\n- $C_{deficit} = 1$ if a disabling deficit is present, and $0$ otherwise.\n- $C_{INR} = 1$ if $INR \\le 1.7$, and $0$ if $INR  1.7$.\n- $C_{platelet} = 1$ if $P \\ge 100 \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}$, and $0$ if $P  100 \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}$.\n\nThe eligibility indicator $E$ is the product of these criteria:\n$$E = C_{deficit} \\cdot C_{INR} \\cdot C_{platelet}$$\n\nNow, we compute $E$ using the patient's specific data:\n- The patient has a \"disabling deficit (NIHSS $=8$ with aphasia)\". Thus, $C_{deficit} = 1$.\n- The patient's $INR$ is $1.6$. The condition is $1.6 \\le 1.7$, which is true. Thus, $C_{INR} = 1$.\n- The patient's platelet count is $P = 220 \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}$. The condition is $220 \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L} \\ge 100 \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}$, which is true. Thus, $C_{platelet} = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $E$:\n$$E = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$$\n\nThe value of the eligibility indicator $E$ is $1$, indicating that the patient is eligible for intravenous alteplase based on the provided information and criteria.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "4487496"}]}
