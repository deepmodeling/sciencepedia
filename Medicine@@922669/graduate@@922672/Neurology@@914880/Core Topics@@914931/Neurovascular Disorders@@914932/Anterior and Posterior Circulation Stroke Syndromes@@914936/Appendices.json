These are signs of an upper motor neuron lesion.\n  - Higher Cortical Functions: No aphasia (intact naming, repetition, comprehension), no neglect, no visual field cut, no cortical sensory loss.\n- Imaging Findings:\n  - MRI DWI: An $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ focus of restricted diffusion (indicative of acute ischemia) localized to the posterior limb of the left internal capsule.\n  - No cortical diffusion abnormalities.\n- Vascular Imaging:\n  - Time-of-flight angiography: No proximal large-vessel occlusion.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem describes a classic clinical scenario of an acute ischemic stroke. The patient's risk factors (hypertension, diabetes), sudden onset, and focal neurological deficits are entirely consistent with this diagnosis. The neuroanatomical localization described is a fundamental concept in neurology. The MRI findings are consistent with a lacunar infarct, a well-established stroke subtype often associated with hypertension and diabetes. The entire problem is firmly grounded in established principles of neurology, neuroanatomy, and neuroradiology.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a specific lesion location (posterior limb of the left internal capsule) and asks for the corresponding clinical syndrome based on first principles. All necessary information is provided to deduce the expected clinical picture. The clinical findings described in the patient vignette are internally consistent and serve as a perfect example of the syndrome being queried.\n- **Objective**: The problem uses precise, objective clinical and radiological terminology. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically sound question that tests core knowledge of clinical neuroanatomy. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution from First Principles**\n\n1.  **Lesion Location and Type**: The lesion is an $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ acute infarct in the posterior limb of the left internal capsule. The small size, deep subcortical location, and absence of a large-vessel occlusion are characteristic of a lacunar stroke, which results from the occlusion of a single small penetrating artery (a lenticulostriate artery, in this case, likely arising from the middle cerebral artery).\n\n2.  **Neuroanatomy of the Internal Capsule**: The internal capsule is a critical white matter structure where a large number of motor and sensory fibers are tightly bundled as they travel between the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures like the thalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord.\n\n3.  **Function of the Posterior Limb**: The posterior limb of the internal capsule is particularly important because it contains the descending corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts.\n    -   The **corticospinal tract** contains motor neurons originating in the cerebral cortex that control voluntary movement of the limbs and trunk.\n    -   The **corticobulbar tract** contains motor neurons for the muscles of the head and neck, including the face.\n\n4.  **Somatotopic Organization**: Within the posterior limb of the internal capsule, these motor fibers are somatotopically organized. While there is some variation in published diagrams, the fibers for the face, arm, and leg are located in close proximity. A small, discrete lesion in this area can therefore interrupt the motor pathways to all three contralateral body parts. This leads to what is known as a \"pure motor hemiparesis\" or \"pure motor stroke\". The tight packing explains why the face, arm, and leg are often affected with similar severity.\n\n5.  **Laterality**: The corticospinal tracts decussate (cross over to the other side) in the medulla oblongata. Therefore, a lesion in the left cerebral hemisphere, such as the left internal capsule, will cause motor deficits on the contralateral, or right, side of the body. This is consistent with the patient's right-sided weakness.\n\n6.  **Preservation of Cortical Functions**: The internal capsule is a subcortical structure. A lesion confined to the internal capsule, as described by the MRI, spares the cerebral cortex. Therefore, functions that are localized to the cortex will be preserved. These include:\n    -   **Language**: Typically localized to Broca's area (frontal lobe) and Wernicke's area (temporal/parietal lobe) in the dominant (usually left) hemisphere.\n    -   **Visuospatial Processing**: Largely a function of the parietal lobe, especially in the non-dominant (usually right) hemisphere.\n    -   **Visual Fields**: Dependent on the optic radiations and the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe. While the optic radiations pass near the posterior part of the internal capsule, a small $8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ lesion as described is unlikely to affect them significantly, and the problem states there is no visual field cut.\n    -   **Cortical Sensation**: Functions like stereognosis (object identification by touch) and graphesthesia are mediated by the sensory cortex in the parietal lobe.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: Based on first principles, an isolated infarct in the posterior limb of the left internal capsule is expected to produce a pure motor hemiparesis affecting the contralateral (right) face, arm, and leg, without any associated cortical deficits such as aphasia, neglect, or visual field loss.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Contralateral pure motor hemiparesis with roughly equal involvement of face, arm, and leg; preserved language and visuospatial functions**\n    This option perfectly describes the clinical syndrome derived from first principles. The lesion in the left posterior limb of the internal capsule interrupts the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts, causing right-sided (contralateral) motor weakness. The tight packing of fibers accounts for the involvement of face, arm, and leg. The subcortical location spares cortical functions like language and visuospatial processing. This is the classic description of a lacunar syndrome.\n    **Verdict: Correct**\n\n*   **B. Contralateral face and arm weakness greater than leg weakness with nonfluent aphasia; impaired repetition**\n    This clinical picture is characteristic of a stroke involving the superior division of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). This territory supplies the lateral motor cortex (where face and arm representation is larger and more lateral than the leg) and Broca's area (causing nonfluent aphasia with impaired repetition). This contradicts the subcortical lesion found on the MRI.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **C. Contralateral leg weakness greater than arm weakness with abulia and impaired initiation; transient urinary incontinence**\n    This clinical picture is characteristic of a stroke in the territory of the left anterior cerebral artery (ACA). This territory supplies the medial motor cortex (responsible for leg movement) and the supplementary motor area and other medial frontal structures (involved in initiation and associated with abulia and incontinence). This contradicts the lesion location in the internal capsule.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **D. Ipsilateral limb ataxia and dysmetria with contralateral loss of pain and temperature and diplopia; impaired horizontal gaze**\n    This constellation of \"crossed\" deficits (ipsilateral cranial nerve/cerebellar signs with contralateral long tract signs) is pathognomonic for a brainstem lesion. For instance, this could be seen with a pontine or lateral medullary stroke (e.g., Wallenberg syndrome). This is anatomically inconsistent with a lesion in the internal capsule, which is a supratentorial structure.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **E. Isolated homonymous hemianopia with alexia without agraphia; intact motor strength**\n    This syndrome is a hallmark of a stroke in the territory of the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA), causing infarction of the left occipital lobe (hemianopia) and the splenium of the corpus callosum (alexia without agraphia, a disconnection syndrome). The statement of \"intact motor strength\" is in direct contradiction to the patient's hemiparesis and the known function of the internal capsule.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4448610"}, {"introduction": "While some stroke syndromes are distinct, others present with significant overlap, demanding a finer level of diagnostic reasoning.

The described syndrome and the distinction between $AICA$ and $PICA$ territories are classic, well-established concepts in medicine.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear set of findings common to a general location (lateral brainstem) and asks for specific differentiating features that would localize the lesion more precisely to one of two possible sub-locations (pons vs. medulla). This structure allows for a unique solution based on established neuroanatomical facts.\n*   **Objective:** The language is clinical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology. The symptoms and anatomical structures are standard within neurology.\n*   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. The initial symptoms correctly define a \"lateral brainstem syndrome,\" which can occur at either the pontine or medullary level. The question's focus on *additional* findings to distinguish between these levels is logically sound and does not contain contradictions.\n*   **Realism:** The clinical scenario is highly realistic. Strokes in the $AICA$ and $PICA$ territories are common and present with the described patterns.\n*   **Structure:** The problem is clearly structured and asks a specific question that can be answered by applying the provided principles of neuroanatomical localization.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and clinically relevant. A rigorous solution can be derived from first principles of neuroanatomy.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe task is to differentiate a lateral pontine infarction ($AICA$ territory) from a lateral medullary infarction ($PICA$ territory), given a set of symptoms common to both. The common symptoms arise from damage to structures that span both the lateral pons and lateral medulla:\n*   **Vestibular nuclei:** Vertigo and nystagmus. These nuclei extend from the rostral medulla into the pons.\n*   **Spinal trigeminal tract and nucleus:** Ipsilateral loss of facial pain and temperature. This long tract descends from the pons through the medulla.\n*   **Anterolateral system (spinothalamic tract):** Contralateral loss of body pain and temperature. This tract ascends through the lateral brainstem at all levels.\n*   **Inferior cerebellar peduncle:** Ipsilateral limb dysmetria. This connects the cerebellum to the medulla and is typically affected in lateral medullary syndromes, while the middle cerebellar peduncle is more associated with the lateral pons. However, cerebellar projections are complex, and dysmetria is a common feature of both syndromes.\n*   **Descending sympathetic fibers:** Ipsilateral Horner syndrome. These fibers descend through the lateral brainstem.\n\nTo distinguish between a pontine and a medullary lesion, one must identify signs resulting from damage to structures that are unique to one level but not the other. The key lies in the rostro-caudal segregation of cranial nerve nuclei, as stipulated by the problem's principles.\n\n*   **Lateral Medulla (PICA territory):** This region contains the nuclei of cranial nerves $IX$ (glossopharyngeal) and $X$ (vagus). The **nucleus ambiguus** provides motor innervation to the pharynx and larynx via these nerves. A lesion here causes hoarseness, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and a diminished gag reflex.\n*   **Lateral Pons (AICA territory):** This region contains the nuclei of cranial nerves $VII$ (facial) and $VIII$ (vestibulocochlear). The **facial motor nucleus** ($CN~VII$) innervates the muscles of facial expression. The **cochlear nuclei** ($CN~VIII$) are crucial for hearing. The $AICA$ often gives rise to the labyrinthine artery, which supplies the inner ear. Therefore, an $AICA$ infarct characteristically involves these two cranial nerves, leading to ipsilateral lower motor neuron (LMN) facial weakness and ipsilateral sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nWith these anatomical facts, we can now evaluate each option.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Ipsilateral lower motor neuron facial weakness with decreased lacrimation and salivation, loss of taste from the anterior $\\tfrac{2}{3}$ of the tongue, and ipsilateral sensorineural hearing loss with tinnitus**\n\nThis constellation of findings points directly to dysfunction of cranial nerves $VII$ and $VIII$.\n*   `LMN facial weakness`: Damage to the facial motor nucleus or its exiting fascicles in the pons.\n*   `Decreased lacrimation and salivation`: Damage to the superior salivatory nucleus (parasympathetic component of $CN~VII$) in the pons.\n*   `Loss of taste from the anterior $\\tfrac{2}{3}$ of the tongue`: Damage to the sensory fibers of $CN~VII$ (chorda tympani) that project to the solitary nucleus.\n*   `Ipsilateral sensorineural hearing loss with tinnitus`: Damage to the cochlear nerve ($CN~VIII$), the cochlear nuclei at the pontomedullary junction, or the labyrinthine artery (typically a branch of $AICA$).\n\nAll these structures are located in the lateral pons or are supplied by the $AICA$. This set of findings is the hallmark of a lateral pontine syndrome and is not seen in a lateral medullary syndrome.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Dysphagia, hoarseness, and diminished gag reflex due to nucleus ambiguus involvement**\n\nThese symptoms—dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), hoarseness, and a decreased gag reflex—are due to damage to the **nucleus ambiguus**, which innervates muscles of the palate, pharynx, and larynx via cranial nerves $IX$ and $X$. The nucleus ambiguus is located in the lateral medulla. Therefore, these findings are characteristic of a lateral *medullary* syndrome ($PICA$ territory, also known as Wallenberg syndrome). They would argue *against* a pontine lesion.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Contralateral loss of vibration and joint position sense due to medial lemniscus involvement**\n\nThe **medial lemniscus** is a major ascending sensory tract that carries vibration and proprioceptive information. Throughout the brainstem (medulla, pons, and midbrain), this tract is located **medially**, not laterally. A lesion affecting the medial lemniscus would cause a *medial* brainstem syndrome, not a lateral one. The vascular supply for medial structures is distinct from the lateral supply (e.g., anterior spinal artery in the medulla, paramedian branches of the basilar artery in the pons).\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Tongue deviation toward the lesion with atrophy and fasciculations due to hypoglossal nucleus involvement**\n\nThese are signs of a lower motor neuron lesion of the **hypoglossal nerve** ($CN~XII$). The hypoglossal nucleus is located in the **medial medulla**. As with option C, this finding points to a *medial* syndrome (medial medullary syndrome), not the lateral syndrome described in the problem.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Vertical gaze palsy with light-near dissociation due to dorsal midbrain lesion**\n\nThis describes Parinaud's syndrome, which is caused by a lesion of the dorsal **midbrain** (specifically, the pretectal area and superior colliculi). This localizes the lesion to an entirely different level of the brainstem, superior to both the pons and the medulla. It is irrelevant to differentiating a pontine from a medullary lesion.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4448608"}, {"introduction": "Modern stroke care extends beyond static localization to the dynamic assessment of tissue at risk.

This would represent the total infarct growth only if the entire penumbra converted to core, which is not what the kinetic model predicts for a $90\\,\\mathrm{min}$ interval. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **C. Approximately $29\\,\\mathrm{mL}$**: This value does not result from any correct application or plausible misapplication of the provided data and model. It is likely the result of one or more calculation errors. **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. Approximately $49\\,\\mathrm{mL}$**: This result is obtained if one makes a common error in defining the initial penumbra. If one incorrectly assumes the entire $V_{T_{\\text{max}}6\\,\\mathrm{s}}$ of $120\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ is the penumbra available for conversion, the calculation would yield a growth of approximately $48.4\\,\\mathrm{mL}$. This interpretation contradicts the problem's explicit definition of penumbra as \"$T_{\\text{max}}6\\,\\mathrm{s}$ voxels (excluding core)\" and fails to use the provided overlap volume of $35\\,\\mathrm{mL}$. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4448620"}]}
