The clinical decision hinges on the post-test probability of SAH, given that early identification and management of aneurysmal SAH are critical to reduce the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia related to vasospasm.\n\nUse the following scientifically supported model for CT sensitivity over time: for times $t \\leq 6$ hours, sensitivity is approximately constant at $\\text{Se}(t) = 0.99$, and for $t > 6$ hours, sensitivity decays exponentially according to\n$$\n\\text{Se}(t) = S_{0} \\exp\\!\\big(-k (t - t_{0})\\big),\n$$\nwhere $S_{0} = 0.99$ and $t_{0} = 6$.

Mean flow velocity in a vessel increases as the vessel radius decreases if volumetric flow is maintained, due to the continuity equation, where for a cylindrical vessel the local relationship is approximately that velocity $v$ scales inversely with cross-sectional area $A$ and thus inversely with radius squared, $v \\propto \\frac{1}{r^{2}}$, when flow is constant.\n- Poiseuille’s law relates laminar volumetric flow $Q$ to vessel radius $r$ and pressure gradient $\\Delta P$ as $Q \\propto \\frac{r^{4}\\,\\Delta P}{\\eta L}$, where $\\eta$ is viscosity and $L$ is length. In vasospasm (reduced $r$), $Q$ is highly sensitive to $r^{4}$, and local velocity measured by TCD typically rises as the lumen narrows, even as the risk of reduced distal flow and ischemia increases.\n- Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is defined as $CPP = MAP - ICP$.

Some schemes further subdivide $3$–$4.5$ as mild and $4.5$–$6$ as moderate.\n\nApplying these to the data:\n- $V_{\\text{MCA}}=220$ cm/s is consistent with severe vasospasm by MCA velocity criteria (given $\\geq 200$ cm/s).\n- $LR=4.40$ lies within $3$–$6$, indicating that the elevation in MCA velocity is not explained by generalized hyperemia; rather, it is consistent with true vasospasm. By the more granular scheme, $LR=4.40$ is at the upper end of mild, bordering moderate.\n\nPhysiological interpretation and management justification:\n- The patient has new focal neurological deficits on post-bleed day $6$, a typical window for delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal SAH.\n- The high MCA velocity reflects a narrowed lumen with increased local velocity; under Poiseuille’s law, the decreased radius $r$ raises resistance dramatically ($\\propto \\frac{1}{r^{4}}$), predisposing to reduced distal perfusion even if local velocity is high. The Lindegaard ratio confirms this is not merely a state of global hyperemia (which would elevate $V_{\\text{ICA}}$ proportionally and reduce $LR$ below $3$).\n- Given $CPP = MAP - ICP$, and measured $MAP=95$ mmHg and $ICP=12$ mmHg, the current $CPP$ is $83$ mmHg. In the setting of increased cerebrovascular resistance from vasospasm, increasing $MAP$ (while monitoring ICP and cardiac status) can increase $CPP$ to drive flow across the spastic segment, potentially reversing neurological deficits. This aligns with the hemodynamic rationale for induced hypertension as first-line escalation for symptomatic vasospasm, in addition to continued nimodipine and meticulous volume/electrolyte management.\n- If neurological deficits persist despite appropriate induced hypertension and optimization of oxygenation and carbon dioxide tension, endovascular therapies (for example, intra-arterial vasodilators or balloon angioplasty for proximal segments) are justified, based on the persistent high-resistance state inferred from TCD and clinical signs.\n\nThus, from first principles of flow and perfusion and established TCD thresholds, the findings justify escalation of hemodynamic management to prevent or treat DCI.\n\nThe required numerical output is the Lindegaard ratio, dimensionless, rounded to three significant figures:\n$$\n4.40.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.40}$$", "id": "4448044"}, {"introduction": "When symptomatic vasospasm is detected, a primary intervention is induced hypertension, aimed at augmenting blood flow through the narrowed arteries.

Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\n1.  **Derivation of Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) and Baseline Calculation**\n    The flow of a fluid through a resistance requires a pressure gradient. In any hydraulic circuit, the volumetric flow rate ($Q$) is driven by the pressure difference ($\\Delta P$) between the inlet and outlet. The problem defines the inlet pressure as the mean arterial pressure ($\\text{MAP}$) and the effective downstream pressure, which represents the outflow pressure for the cerebral microcirculation, as the intracranial pressure ($\\text{ICP}$).\n\n    Therefore, the driving pressure for cerebral perfusion, known as the cerebral perfusion pressure ($\\text{CPP}$), is given by the equation:\n    $$ \\text{CPP} = P_{\\text{in}} - P_{\\text{out}} = \\text{MAP} - \\text{ICP} $$\n    This relationship is a cornerstone of neurocritical care.\n\n    Using the given baseline values:\n    - $\\text{MAP}_1 = 100 \\text{ mmHg}$\n    - $\\text{ICP}_1 = 20 \\text{ mmHg}$\n\n    The baseline $\\text{CPP}$ is calculated as:\n    $$ \\text{CPP}_1 = 100 \\text{ mmHg} - 20 \\text{ mmHg} = 80 \\text{ mmHg} $$\n\n2.  **Calculation of New Cerebral Perfusion Pressure**\n    The intervention involves increasing the $\\text{MAP}$ by $20 \\text{ mmHg}$ while the $\\text{ICP}$ remains constant.\n    The new mean arterial pressure, $\\text{MAP}_2$, is:\n    $$ \\text{MAP}_2 = \\text{MAP}_1 + 20 \\text{ mmHg} = 100 \\text{ mmHg} + 20 \\text{ mmHg} = 120 \\text{ mmHg} $$\n    The intracranial pressure remains unchanged:\n    $$ \\text{ICP}_2 = \\text{ICP}_1 = 20 \\text{ mmHg} $$\n    The new cerebral perfusion pressure, $\\text{CPP}_2$, is calculated using the same principle:\n    $$ \\text{CPP}_2 = \\text{MAP}_2 - \\text{ICP}_2 = 120 \\text{ mmHg} - 20 \\text{ mmHg} = 100 \\text{ mmHg} $$\n\n3.  **Determination of the Multiplicative Change in Blood Flow**\n    The problem states that Hagen–Poiseuille flow applies. The equation for volumetric flow rate ($Q$) through a rigid cylindrical tube is:\n    $$ Q = \\frac{\\Delta P \\cdot \\pi r^4}{8 \\eta L} $$\n    In this context, the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ is the $\\text{CPP}$. The equation becomes:\n    $$ Q = \\frac{\\text{CPP} \\cdot \\pi r^4}{8 \\eta L} $$\n    The problem specifies that the vasospastic radius ($r$), the segment length ($L$), and the blood viscosity ($\\eta$) are fixed during the short interval of the intervention. This is consistent with the assumption of impaired autoregulation, where the vessel does not change its diameter in response to perfusion pressure changes. Consequently, the term representing cerebrovascular resistance, $R_{\\text{CVR}}$, is constant:\n    $$ R_{\\text{CVR}} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4} = \\text{constant} $$\n    The flow relationship simplifies to Ohm's law for fluid circuits:\n    $$ Q = \\frac{\\text{CPP}}{R_{\\text{CVR}}} $$\n    This shows that, under the given assumptions, the volumetric blood flow ($Q$) is directly proportional to the cerebral perfusion pressure ($\\text{CPP}$).\n\n    We are asked to find the multiplicative change in flow, which is the ratio of the new flow rate ($Q_2$) to the baseline flow rate ($Q_1$):\n    $$ \\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \\frac{\\text{CPP}_2 / R_{\\text{CVR}}}{\\text{CPP}_1 / R_{\\text{CVR}}} $$\n    Since $R_{\\text{CVR}}$ is constant, it cancels out:\n    $$ \\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \\frac{\\text{CPP}_2}{\\text{CPP}_1} $$\n    Substituting the calculated values for $\\text{CPP}_1$ and $\\text{CPP}_2$:\n    $$ \\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \\frac{100 \\text{ mmHg}}{80 \\text{ mmHg}} = \\frac{10}{8} = 1.25 $$\n    The problem requires this flow change factor to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n    The exact value $1.25$ can be written as $1.250$ to satisfy this requirement.\n\n    The final results are:\n    - Baseline CPP: $80 \\text{ mmHg}$\n    - New CPP: $100 \\text{ mmHg}$\n    - Flow change factor: $1.250$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 80 & 100 & 1.250 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4448101"}]}
