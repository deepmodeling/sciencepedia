There is no evidence of lower motor neuron facial palsy, hyperacusis, or ipsilateral hearing loss. Computed Tomography (CT) of the head is without hemorrhage. You are asked to identify the most likely occluded vessel and predict the patterns expected on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA).\n\nUse the following fundamental bases:\n- Neuroanatomy of somatosensory and autonomic pathways: the anterolateral (spinothalamic) system conveys pain–temperature from the body and decussates within a few spinal segments; the spinal trigeminal tract and nucleus convey ipsilateral facial pain–temperature; the descending hypothalamospinal sympathetic fibers course in the lateral brainstem; and the nucleus ambiguus (cranial nerves $IX$ and $X$) mediates swallowing and phonation.\n- Vascular territories: the lateral medulla is supplied by penetrating branches arising from the distal vertebral artery and the Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA); the cerebellar hemispheric cortex in the posterior–inferior territory is supplied by PICA; lateral pontine territories are supplied by the Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (AICA); medial medullary territories are supplied by the anterior spinal artery.\n- MRI physics of acute ischemia: acute cytotoxic edema produces restricted diffusion with high signal on Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and low Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) values; MRA (time-of-flight) demonstrates loss of flow-related enhancement in occluded segments and reduced caliber in high-grade stenosis.\n\nWhich option best matches the clinical syndrome, culprit vessel, and imaging predictions?\n\nA.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of neuroanatomy and stroke neurology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent clinical data to arrive at a specific anatomical and vascular localization, and objectively stated.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows:\n\nFirst, we must localize the lesion based on the presented clinical signs and symptoms by mapping them to known neuroanatomical structures.\n\n1.  **Anatomical Localization of the Lesion**:\n    *   **Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and hoarseness (dysphonia)**: These symptoms result from dysfunction of cranial nerves $IX$ (glossopharyngeal) and $X$ (vagus). Specifically, the lesion affects the nucleus ambiguus, their shared motor nucleus located in the lateral medulla.\n    *   **Ipsilateral facial pain–temperature sensory loss**: This is due to a lesion of the spinal trigeminal nucleus and tract, which descends into the upper cervical spinal cord and occupies the lateral aspect of the medulla. It processes pain and temperature information from the ipsilateral face.\n    *   **Contralateral body pain–temperature sensory loss**: This results from damage to the anterolateral system (spinothalamic tract), which has already decussated in the spinal cord and ascends through the lateral medulla en route to the thalamus.\n    *   **Ipsilateral Horner’s syndrome (partial ptosis and miosis)**: This syndrome is caused by interruption of the descending sympathetic fibers that travel from the hypothalamus down through the lateral brainstem, including the lateral medulla, on their way to the spinal cord.\n    *   **Truncal ataxia and nystagmus**: These are signs of cerebellar or vestibular system dysfunction. A lesion in the dorsolateral medulla can damage the inferior cerebellar peduncle (the main input/output pathway for the cerebellum at this level) and/or the vestibular nuclei, which are also located in the dorsolateral medulla and pons.\n    *   **Negative Signs**: The absence of certain signs is equally critical for localization. The patient has `no limb weakness`, which spares the pyramidal (corticospinal) tracts located in the medial medulla. The `intact facial motor function` (no lower motor neuron facial palsy) and `no hyperacusis or ipsilateral hearing loss` spares the facial nucleus ($CN~VII$) and vestibulocochlear nerve/nuclei ($CN~VIII$), which are located more rostrally in the pons.\n\n    **Synthesis**: The convergence of all these positive and negative findings—dysphagia, hoarseness, ipsilateral Horner's syndrome, ipsilateral facial and contralateral body pain-temperature loss, and ataxia, with sparing of limb motor function—unequivocally localizes the lesion to the **dorsolateral portion of the medulla oblongata**. This classic clinical presentation is known as the **Lateral Medullary Syndrome**, or Wallenberg syndrome.\n\n2.  **Vascular and Imaging Correlation**:\n    *   According to the provided fundamental bases, the lateral medulla is supplied by penetrating branches from the **distal vertebral artery** (intracranial segment, or $V4$) and its major branch, the **Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA)**. Occlusion of either vessel can cause Lateral Medullary Syndrome. In clinical practice, occlusion of the vertebral artery is a more frequent cause than isolated PICA occlusion.\n    *   Based on MRI physics, an acute ischemic stroke in this location will manifest as a region of restricted diffusion, appearing as a hyperintensity (bright signal) on Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) with a corresponding low signal on the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient ($ADC$) map.\n    *   Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) visualizes blood flow. An occlusion will appear as an abrupt termination of the flow-related signal (a \"cutoff\") in the affected artery.\n\n3.  **Evaluation of Options**:\n\n    *   **A. Occlusion of PICA... MRI shows DWI hyperintensity predominantly in the posterior–inferior cerebellar hemisphere with only minimal medullary involvement...**\n        This describes a stroke primarily affecting the cerebellum. While an isolated PICA occlusion can cause a lateral medullary syndrome, the description of \"minimal medullary involvement\" is inconsistent with the patient's profound and extensive medullary signs (e.g., dysphagia, hoarseness, Horner's). The clinical picture suggests a significant medullary lesion.\n        **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n    *   **B. Occlusion of the distal vertebral artery segment ($V4$) ... compromising lateral medullary perforators; MRI shows DWI hyperintensity with low $ADC$ localized to the ipsilateral dorsolateral medulla... without a large hemispheric cerebellar infarct; MRA shows absent flow-related enhancement or a cutoff in the ipsilateral distal vertebral artery...**\n        This option correctly identifies vertebral artery occlusion, a common cause of Lateral Medullary Syndrome, which directly affects the small arteries supplying the lateral medulla. The predicted MRI findings of a localized dorsolateral medullary infarct perfectly match the anatomical localization derived from the clinical signs. The possibility of sparing the cerebellum is also consistent, as PICA may have a variable origin or be backfilled via collateral circulation. The MRA findings of a vertebral artery cutoff are the expected consequence. This option provides the most coherent and complete explanation.\n        **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n    *   **C. Occlusion of Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (AICA)...**\n        An AICA occlusion would cause an infarct in the lateral caudal pons, affecting structures such as the facial nucleus (causing ipsilateral facial paralysis), and often the labyrinthine artery (causing unilateral deafness and vertigo). The patient's lack of facial palsy and hearing loss explicitly rules out this diagnosis.\n        **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n    *   **D. Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery...**\n        Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery at this level causes Medial Medullary Syndrome. This affects the medial structures: the pyramidal tract (contralateral hemiparesis), medial lemniscus (contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception), and hypoglossal nucleus (ipsilateral tongue deviation). The patient's signs do not match this pattern; there is no limb weakness, and the sensory loss is pain-temperature, not vibration/proprioception.\n        **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n    *   **E. Basilar artery tip occlusion...**\n        Occlusion at the top of the basilar artery affects the rostral brainstem (midbrain), thalami, and occipital lobes. This results in a completely different clinical syndrome, often involving altered consciousness, visual disturbances, and eye movement abnormalities. The patient's lesion is clearly in the caudal brainstem (medulla).\n        **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4459264"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of anatomical localization, we now move rostrally from the medulla to the midbrain.

The combination of an ipsilateral cranial nerve palsy with contralateral long-tract signs is a classic presentation of a brainstem lesion. The signs themselves—oculomotor palsy, cerebellar ataxia—are well-defined in neurology and are directly attributable to the dysfunction of specific, known neuroanatomical structures (e.g., oculomotor nerve, cerebellar pathways). The concepts of nuclei, fascicles, decussation, and topographical organization of the brainstem are fundamental principles of neuroanatomy. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a set of positive and negative clinical findings that are sufficient to localize a lesion to a specific region of the central nervous system. It asks for a specific neuroanatomical explanation, which is a standard and solvable task in clinical neuroscience. A unique, logical solution can be derived from the given information. The problem is well-posed.\n\n3.  **Objective:** The description of the signs is objective and uses standard clinical terminology (e.g., \"dysmetria,\" \"intention tremor,\" \"fixed dilated pupil\"). It is free of subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n4.  **Consistency and Completeness:** The signs are internally consistent. A right-sided complete third nerve palsy combined with left-sided ataxia points to a focal lesion in the right midbrain. The absence of hemiparesis (corticospinal tract) or hemisensory loss (medial lemniscus) provides critical localizing information, indicating the lesion spares these adjacent tracts. The problem is sufficiently complete for the task it sets.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It presents a coherent, scientifically sound, and well-posed clinical scenario that can be solved through neuroanatomical reasoning. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe clinical syndrome must be deconstructed into its neuroanatomical components.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Right-Sided Signs:**\n    The combination of right eyelid droop (ptosis, from paralysis of the levator palpebrae superioris), an abducted and depressed (\"down and out\") right eye (from unopposed action of the lateral rectus, innervated by $CN~VI$, and superior oblique, innervated by $CN~IV$), and impaired adduction, elevation, and depression (from paralysis of the remaining extraocular muscles) constitutes a complete somatic palsy of the right oculomotor nerve ($CN~III$). The fixed dilated right pupil (mydriasis) indicates a palsy of the parasympathetic fibers that travel with $CN~III$ and originate in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus. The involvement of both somatic and visceral efferent components localizes the pathology to the right $CN~III$ nucleus or its fascicles (the intra-axial portion of the nerve).\n\n2.  **Analysis of Left-Sided Signs:**\n    The pronounced dysmetria and intention tremor in the left upper limb are cardinal signs of appendicular ataxia. The broad-based gait with veering to the left is a sign of gait/truncal ataxia. Both point to dysfunction of the cerebellum or its pathways.\n\n3.  **Integration and Localization:**\n    The combination of an ipsilateral ($right$) $CN~III$ palsy and contralateral ($left$) ataxia is a classic crossed brainstem syndrome. The lesion must be located in the **right midbrain**.\n\n    To produce contralateral ataxia, the lesion must affect the cerebellar outflow pathway *after* its decussation. The primary efferent pathway from the cerebellum for coordinating limb movements is the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract. Fibers from the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum ascend in the superior cerebellar peduncle. These fibers **decussate** at the level of the caudal midbrain (inferior colliculi). After crossing, they ascend to synapse in the contralateral **red nucleus** and the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus.\n\n    Therefore, a lesion causing *left-sided* ataxia must damage these fibers on the *right* side of the midbrain, after the decussation. The affected structures are the right red nucleus and/or the now-crossed fibers of the superior cerebellar peduncle.\n\n    The nucleus of $CN~III$ is located in the rostral midbrain tegmentum at the level of the superior colliculus. The fascicles of $CN~III$ course ventrally from the nucleus, passing through the tegmentum in proximity to, and often directly through, the red nucleus before exiting the brainstem in the interpeduncular fossa.\n\n    A single, focal lesion in the **tegmentum of the right rostral midbrain** can simultaneously damage the exiting fascicles of the right $CN~III$ (causing the right oculomotor palsy) and the adjacent right red nucleus or the surrounding dentato-rubro-thalamic fibers (which originated from the left cerebellum, crossed, and are now on the right side), causing the left-sided ataxia. This specific clinical presentation is known as **Claude's syndrome**. The absence of hemiparesis confirms the lesion is confined to the tegmentum and does not extend ventrally to involve the cerebral peduncle (crus cerebri), which contains the corticospinal tract.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Red nucleus and oculomotor fascicles, localizing to the rostral midbrain tegmentum at the level of the superior colliculus where crossed dentato–rubro–thalamic fibers of the superior cerebellar peduncle course**\n-   **Structures:** A lesion involving the right oculomotor fascicles explains the right $CN~III$ palsy. A lesion involving the right red nucleus or the adjacent crossed superior cerebellar peduncle fibers explains the left-sided appendicular ataxia and tremor. This is a perfect match.\n-   **Location:** The rostral midbrain tegmentum at the level of the superior colliculus is the precise location where the red nucleus is prominent and the oculomotor fascicles pass through.\n-   **Justification:** The statement that crossed dentato-rubro-thalamic fibers of the superior cerebellar peduncle course here is anatomically correct and provides the exact mechanism for the contralateral cerebellar signs.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Substantia nigra pars compacta and trochlear fascicles, localizing to the caudal midbrain at the level of the inferior colliculus where uncrossed middle cerebellar peduncle fibers course**\n-   **Structures:** The patient has a $CN~III$ palsy, not a trochlear ($CN~IV$) palsy. A lesion of the substantia nigra pars compacta causes Parkinsonian signs (e.g., rest tremor, bradykinesia), not cerebellar ataxia (intention tremor).\n-   **Location & Justification:** The trochlear nucleus is indeed in the caudal midbrain. However, the middle cerebellar peduncle connects the pons to the cerebellum; it does not course through the midbrain tegmentum. Furthermore, the fibers responsible for this type of ataxia are efferents in the *superior* cerebellar peduncle, not afferents in the *middle* cerebellar peduncle. This option is incorrect in its description of the affected cranial nerve, the resulting motor disorder, and the anatomical pathways.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Pretectal nucleus and posterior commissure fibers, localizing to the dorsal midbrain where vertical gaze centers reside**\n-   **Structures & Location:** A lesion in this dorsal location (the pretectum) causes Parinaud's syndrome, characterized by supranuclear vertical gaze palsy, light-near dissociation, and convergence-retraction nystagmus. The patient's signs are clearly a nuclear/fascicular $CN~III$ palsy, not a gaze palsy. Furthermore, a dorsal lesion would not affect the red nucleus or superior cerebellar peduncle fibers to cause contralateral ataxia.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Edinger–Westphal nucleus and medial longitudinal fasciculus, localizing to the periaqueductal region where internuclear pathways run**\n-   **Structures & Location:** A lesion of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus would explain the dilated pupil but not the extensive somatic muscle palsy (ptosis, \"down and out\" eye). A lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) causes internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), a specific gaze-evoked dissociation of eye movements, not a complete unilateral ophthalmoplegia at rest. Critically, a lesion confined to the periaqueductal gray and MLF would not cause contralateral limb ataxia, as this region is medial and dorsal to the red nucleus and cerebellar outflow tracts.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4459317"}, {"introduction": "Beyond localization and diagnosis, the management of posterior fossa strokes demands vigilance for life-threatening complications.

A complete solution can be derived from the provided information.\n\nThe task is to compute the decompression decision index $R$. This index is defined as the maximum of two normalized criteria: the lesion volume normalized to its surgical threshold, and the maximal axial diameter normalized to its surgical threshold. The explicit formula for $R$ is given by:\n$$R = \\max\\left(C_V, C_d\\right)$$\nwhere $C_V$ is the volume criterion and $C_d$ is the diameter criterion. These are defined as:\n$$C_V = \\frac{V}{V_{\\text{threshold}}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad C_d = \\frac{d_{\\max}}{d_{\\text{threshold}}}$$\nThe given threshold values are $V_{\\text{threshold}} = 15$ mL and $d_{\\text{threshold}} = 3$ cm.\n\nFirst, we compute the diameter criterion, $C_d$.

This requires calculating the lesion volume, $V$. The problem instructs to \"use the ellipsoidal approximation\".

The \"fractional involvement per slice\" ($f_i$) represents the proportion of each slice's thickness occupied by the lesion.
