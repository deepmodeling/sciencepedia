This first practice grounds you in the fundamentals by requiring the calculation of walking speed from its core components: stride length and cadence.

Assume standard Earth gravity $g = 9.81$ m/s$^{2}$. The assessment requires two quantities grounded in fundamental kinematics and dynamic similarity principles used in gait analysis.\n\n1) Using the fundamental definitions that cadence $C$ is the number of steps per unit time, stride length $L$ is the distance advanced in two consecutive steps by the same foot, step length is half the stride length, and walking speed $v$ is distance over time, derive an expression for the steady-state forward walking speed $v$ in terms of $L$ and $C$ and evaluate it numerically.\n\n2) Modeling the body’s center of mass (Center of Mass (COM)) during the stance phase as vaulting over a leg of length $L_{\\text{leg}}$ in an inverted pendulum regime, use dimensional analysis and first principles of kinematics to construct a dimensionless quantity that compares the characteristic centripetal acceleration associated with forward motion to gravitational acceleration.

Round both results to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of two quantities related to gait analysis: the steady-state forward walking speed $v$, and a dimensionless number that relates inertial and gravitational effects.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of Walking Speed ($v$)**\n\nWe are given the following definitions and values:\n- Stride length, $L = 1.4$ m, is the distance covered in two steps.\n- Cadence, $C = 110$ steps/min, is the number of steps taken per minute.\n- Walking speed, $v$, is the distance traveled per unit time.\n\nTo derive an expression for $v$ in terms of $L$ and $C$, we can reason as follows. The speed is the product of the distance per step (step length) and the number of steps per unit time (step frequency).\n\nThe stride length $L$ corresponds to two steps. Therefore, the step length $L_{\\text{step}}$ is half the stride length:\n$$L_{\\text{step}} = \\frac{L}{2}$$\n\nThe cadence $C$ is given in steps per minute. To obtain the speed in meters per second (m/s), we must convert the cadence to steps per second. Let's denote the cadence in steps per second as $f_{\\text{step}}$.\n$$f_{\\text{step}} = \\frac{C \\text{ steps}}{1 \\text{ min}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ min}}{60 \\text{ s}} = \\frac{C}{60} \\frac{\\text{steps}}{\\text{s}}$$\n\nThe walking speed $v$ is the product of the step length and the step frequency:\n$$v = L_{\\text{step}} \\times f_{\\text{step}} = \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{C}{60}\\right) = \\frac{LC}{120}$$\nThis expression gives the speed $v$ in m/s when $L$ is in meters and $C$ is in steps/min.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $L = 1.4$ m and $C = 110$ steps/min.\n$$v = \\frac{1.4 \\times 110}{120} = \\frac{154}{120} = \\frac{77}{60} \\text{ m/s}$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$v \\approx 1.28333... \\text{ m/s}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get $v = 1.283$ m/s.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation and Calculation of the Dimensionless Number**\n\nThe problem asks us to model the body's center of mass (COM) as vaulting over a leg of length $L_{\\text{leg}}$ in an inverted pendulum regime. We must construct a dimensionless quantity that compares the characteristic centripetal acceleration to gravitational acceleration, $g$.\n\nIn the inverted pendulum model of walking, the COM follows a circular arc during the single-support phase of gait. The radius of this arc is the length of the supporting leg, $r = L_{\\text{leg}}$. The speed of the COM along this arc is the forward walking speed, $v$.\n\nThe centripetal acceleration, $a_c$, required to keep the COM on this curved path is given by:\n$$a_c = \\frac{v^2}{r} = \\frac{v^2}{L_{\\text{leg}}}$$\n\nThe problem requires a dimensionless quantity, which we will denote as $\\Pi$, formed by comparing this centripetal acceleration to the acceleration due to gravity, $g$. The most direct comparison is a ratio:\n$$\\Pi = \\frac{\\text{centripetal acceleration}}{\\text{gravitational acceleration}} = \\frac{a_c}{g} = \\frac{v^2/L_{\\text{leg}}}{g} = \\frac{v^2}{g L_{\\text{leg}}}$$\nThis dimensionless quantity is known in biomechanics and fluid dynamics as the Froude number, $Fr$.\n\nTo confirm its unique form (up to a multiplicative constant) as requested, we use dimensional analysis. We seek a dimensionless product $\\Pi$ of the form $\\Pi = v^a g^b L_{\\text{leg}}^c$. The dimensions of the quantities are $[v] = LT^{-1}$, $[g] = LT^{-2}$, and $[L_{\\text{leg}}] = L$.\n$$[\\Pi] = [v]^a [g]^b [L_{\\text{leg}}]^c = (LT^{-1})^a (LT^{-2})^b (L)^c = L^{a+b+c} T^{-a-2b}$$\nFor $\\Pi$ to be dimensionless, the exponents of mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$) must be zero.\nFor $T$: $-a - 2b = 0 \\implies a = -2b$.\nFor $L$: $a + b + c = 0$.\nSubstituting $a = -2b$ into the second equation gives $(-2b) + b + c = 0 \\implies -b + c = 0 \\implies b = c$.\nWe can choose the exponent for one variable, which fixes the others. The problem's framing as a ratio of accelerations, $a_c/g$, implies setting the power of $g$ to $b=-1$. This gives $c=b=-1$ and $a=-2b=2$.\nThus, $\\Pi = v^2 g^{-1} L_{\\text{leg}}^{-1} = \\frac{v^2}{g L_{\\text{leg}}}$, confirming the derived form.\n\nWe can now evaluate this quantity numerically using the value of $v$ from Part 1, and the given values $g = 9.81$ m/s$^2$ and $L_{\\text{leg}} = 0.9$ m. For accuracy, we use the exact fractional value of $v = \\frac{77}{60}$ m/s.\n$$\\Pi = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{77}{60}\\right)^2}{9.81 \\times 0.9} = \\frac{\\frac{5929}{3600}}{8.829} = \\frac{5929}{3600 \\times 8.829} = \\frac{5929}{31784.4}$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$\\Pi \\approx 0.186539...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\Pi = 0.1865$.\n\nThe final results are:\n- Walking speed $v \\approx 1.283$ m/s.\n- Dimensionless number $\\Pi \\approx 0.1865$.\nThe problem requests the final answer as a pair of numbers $(v, \\Pi)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.283 & 0.1865\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4471624"}, {"introduction": "Beyond measuring basic parameters, a key skill in clinical gait analysis is quantifying deviations from the norm, such as asymmetry between the left and right sides. This exercise challenges you to move beyond simply plugging numbers into a formula by deriving a clinically standard symmetry index from a set of foundational mathematical properties. By doing so, you will gain a deeper appreciation for what makes a metric robust and how to translate a calculated value into a meaningful clinical interpretation [@problem_id:4471652].", "problem": "A neurologist evaluates a patient’s step length asymmetry during a standardized overground walking assessment and records a left step length of $0.72$ m and a right step length of $0.66$ m. You are asked to build, from first principles, a dimensionless symmetry index $S(L,R)$ for step length magnitude that captures the following properties grounded in standard measurement principles for coordination and gait assessment:\n\n1. Symmetry: $S(L,R)$ is invariant under exchanging sides, so $S(L,R)=S(R,L)$.\n2. Zero at equality: $S(L,R)=0$ if and only if $L=R$.\n3. Scale invariance: $S(\\alpha L,\\alpha R)=S(L,R)$ for any $\\alpha>0$ (uniform rescaling does not change the index).\n4. Local relative sensitivity: for a small deviation $R=L(1+\\varepsilon)$ with $|\\varepsilon|\\ll 1$, the index reduces, to first order, to the magnitude of the relative difference, so $S(L,R)=|\\varepsilon|+o(|\\varepsilon|)$.\n\nStarting from these properties and the fundamental idea that a normalized difference must be compared to a representative scale of the two measurements to be dimensionless and scale-invariant, derive an explicit closed-form expression for $S(L,R)$ and then compute its value using $L=0.72$ m and $R=0.66$ m. Finally, based on established observations in neurological gait assessment regarding typical asymmetry magnitudes in healthy versus pathological gait, provide a brief interpretation of the clinical significance of the asymmetry magnitude you computed.\n\nExpress the final symmetry index as a pure number (dimensionless), rounded to four significant figures. Do not use a percent sign in your final numerical result. No other quantities should be provided in the final numeric answer.", "solution": "The problem requires us to derive a symmetry index $S(L,R)$ from first principles, calculate its value for the given step lengths, and provide a clinical interpretation.\n\n### Derivation of the Symmetry Index\nThe guiding principle is to create a dimensionless, scale-invariant index by comparing the difference between two measurements, $L$ and $R$, to a representative scale of these measurements.\n\nThe difference in magnitude is naturally captured by $|L-R|$. The absolute value ensures the difference is non-negative and satisfies the symmetry requirement of Property 1, since $|L-R| = |R-L|$.\n\nTo create a dimensionless index that is also scale-invariant (Property 3), this difference must be normalized by a quantity that has the same units as $L$ and $R$ and scales linearly with them. Let this normalization factor be a function $f(L,R)$. For $S(L,R) = \\frac{|L-R|}{f(L,R)}$ to be scale-invariant, $f(L,R)$ must be a homogeneous function of degree 1. Additionally, Property 1 ($S(L,R)=S(R,L)$) implies that $f(L,R)$ must also be a symmetric function, i.e., $f(L,R)=f(R,L)$. The most general form for such a function representing a \"representative scale\" is a multiple of the arithmetic mean, $f(L,R) = c(L+R)$ for some constant $c$.\n\nWe now use Property 4 to determine the constant $c$. Let $R = L(1+\\varepsilon)$ for a small quantity $\\varepsilon$.\nThe proposed index becomes:\n$$S(L, L(1+\\varepsilon)) = \\frac{|L - L(1+\\varepsilon)|}{c(L + L(1+\\varepsilon))} = \\frac{|-L\\varepsilon|}{cL(2+\\varepsilon)} = \\frac{L|\\varepsilon|}{cL(2+\\varepsilon)} = \\frac{|\\varepsilon|}{c(2+\\varepsilon)}$$\nAccording to Property 4, we must have $S(L,R) = |\\varepsilon| + o(|\\varepsilon|)$. This implies that the leading term of the expression must be $|\\varepsilon|$. We can check this by taking the limit:\n$$\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} \\frac{S(L,R)}{|\\varepsilon|} = \\lim_{\\varepsilon \\to 0} \\frac{1}{c(2+\\varepsilon)} = \\frac{1}{2c}$$\nFor the local sensitivity property to hold, this limit must be $1$.\n$$\\frac{1}{2c} = 1 \\implies c = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis uniquely determines the normalization factor to be the arithmetic mean, $f(L,R) = \\frac{L+R}{2}$. Substituting this into our expression for $S(L,R)$ gives the explicit closed-form expression:\n$$S(L,R) = \\frac{|L-R|}{(L+R)/2} = \\frac{2|L-R|}{L+R}$$\nThis derived index is a standard definition of the Symmetry Index in gait analysis literature. It satisfies all four properties, including Property 2, as $\\frac{2|L-R|}{L+R} = 0$ if and only if $|L-R|=0$, which means $L=R$ (for non-zero step lengths).\n\n### Calculation\nWe are given the step lengths $L = 0.72$ m and $R = 0.66$ m. We compute the value of the symmetry index $S(L,R)$:\n$$S(0.72, 0.66) = \\frac{2|0.72 - 0.66|}{0.72 + 0.66} = \\frac{2(0.06)}{1.38} = \\frac{0.12}{1.38}$$\nThis simplifies to the fraction $\\frac{12}{138} = \\frac{2}{23}$. Now, we convert this fraction to a decimal:\n$$S = \\frac{2}{23} \\approx 0.08695652...$$\nThe problem asks to round the result to four significant figures. The value is $0.08695652...$. The first four significant digits define the number `0.0869`. The following digit is `5`. According to standard rounding rules, since this digit is 5 or greater, we round up the last digit of our target number. Thus, `0.0869` is rounded up to `0.0870`.\n\n### Clinical Interpretation\nThe computed symmetry index is $0.0870$. When expressed as a percentage, this is $8.70\\%$. In the context of neurological gait assessment, perfect symmetry corresponds to an index of $0$. Gait in healthy, asymptomatic adults is nearly symmetric, with symmetry indices for spatiotemporal parameters like step length typically being less than $3-5\\%$. Values exceeding $10\\%$ are commonly considered indicative of a significant asymmetry, often associated with pathological conditions such as post-stroke hemiparesis, limb-length discrepancy, unilateral orthopedic injury, or the use of a prosthesis. The calculated value of $8.70\\%$ falls in a range that is markedly higher than that observed in a healthy population and is clinically meaningful. It would typically prompt further investigation to identify the underlying cause of the gait imbalance.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.0870}\n$$", "id": "4471652"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of coordination and gait assessment is not just to collect data, but to synthesize it into a coherent diagnosis.

Leads to dysmetria (scaling errors) and timing variability. Manifests as irregular, unpredictable foot placement (high step-to-step variability). Only modestly improved by visual substitution.\n2.  **Sensory Ataxia:** Caused by loss of proprioceptive fidelity from the dorsal column–medial lemniscus (DCML) pathway, impairing position sense and online feedback.

The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to differentiate between two patients based on their gait characteristics and responses to manipulations, and to identify the underlying neurological condition (cerebellar vs. sensory ataxia) based on the provided principles.\n\n**Analysis of Patient C:**\n\n1.  **Gait Variability:** Let's calculate the Coefficient of Variation ($CV$) for the baseline (eyes open) condition.\n    -   Stride Length $CV = 100 \\times \\frac{0.20 \\text{ m}}{1.00 \\text{ m}} = 20\\%$.\n    -   Step Width $CV = 100 \\times \\frac{0.09 \\text{ m}}{0.30 \\text{ m}} = 30\\%$.\n    These values for $CV$ are extremely high, indicating significant step-to-step irregularity and poor predictive control of foot placement. This aligns with the description of cerebellar ataxia: \"irregular, unpredictable foot placement and increased step-to-step variability\".\n\n2.  **Compensatory Signs:**\n    -   The peak vertical GRF is $1.10$ BW. This is within the normal range for walking and does not indicate \"stomping\".\n    -   The toe clearance is $0.06$ m, which is not excessively high.\n\n3.  **Sensory System Status:**\n    -   JPS error is $2.00$ degrees (low/normal).\n    -   Vibration sense is normal.\n    -   Romberg testing is negative.\n    These results collectively indicate that the DCML pathway and proprioceptive function are intact. This rules out sensory ataxia.\n\n4.  **Response to Manipulations:**\n    -   **Manipulation 1 (Eyes Closed):** Stride length SD increases from $0.20$ m to $0.22$ m (a $10\\%$ increase). Step width SD increases from $0.09$ m to $0.10$ m (an $11\\%$ increase). This is a *modest* increase in variability, consistent with the principle that cerebellar ataxia is \"only modestly improved by visual substitution\".\n    -   **Manipulation 2 (Cutaneous Augmentation):** Spatial variability changes *minimally*. This is expected, as the primary problem is a failure of the cerebellum's internal model, not a lack of sensory input.\n\n**Conclusion for Patient C:** The combination of high intrinsic variability in foot placement, normal heel-strike force, intact proprioception, and only modest visual dependence is the classic presentation of **cerebellar ataxia**.\n\n**Analysis of Patient S:**\n\n1.  **Gait Variability:**\n    -   Stride Length $CV = 100 \\times \\frac{0.06 \\text{ m}}{1.10 \\text{ m}} \\approx 5.45\\%$.\n    -   Step Width $CV = 100 \\times \\frac{0.02 \\text{ m}}{0.25 \\text{ m}} = 8.0\\%$.\n    With eyes open, these $CV$ values are substantially lower than Patient C's, indicating that the patient's gait is not intrinsically irregular or dysmetric in the same way. The problem lies elsewhere.\n\n2.  **Compensatory Signs:**\n    -   The peak vertical GRF is $1.80$ BW. This is extremely high and is the biomechanical signature of a \"stomping\" gait.\n    -   The mean toe clearance is $0.14$ m. This is very high, suggesting a high-stepping gait to ensure the foot clears the ground when its position is uncertain.\n    These features match the description of sensory ataxia: \"compensatory augmentation of afferent input (for example, large heel impact) and increased foot clearance\".\n\n3.  **Sensory System Status:**\n    -   JPS error is $8.00$ degrees (high/abnormal).\n    -   Vibration sense thresholds are elevated.\n    -   Romberg testing is strongly positive.\n    These results are definitive evidence of a profound proprioceptive deficit, consistent with a lesion in the DCML pathway.\n\n4.  **Response to Manipulations:**\n    -   **Manipulation 1 (Eyes Closed):** Stride length SD increases from $0.06$ m to $0.20$ m (a $233\\%$ increase). Step width SD increases from $0.02$ m to $0.06$ m (a $200\\%$ increase). This *marked* worsening of stability upon removal of vision demonstrates the \"strong visual dependence\" characteristic of sensory ataxia.\n    -   **Manipulation 2 (Cutaneous Augmentation):** The application of cutaneous input causes the heel-strike GRF to decrease from $1.80$ BW to $1.50$ BW and toe clearance to decrease from $0.14$ m to $0.11$ m. This demonstrates that providing an alternative/augmented source of sensory information reduces the need for the compensatory stomping and high-stepping.\n\n**Conclusion for Patient S:** The combination of profound proprioceptive loss, strong visual dependence, and the use of compensatory strategies (stomping, high-stepping) that are reduced by augmenting sensory input is the classic presentation of **sensory ataxia**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Patient C exhibits cerebellar ataxia: high spatial $CV$ (stride length and step width) with relatively normal heel-strike force and minimal visual dependence; Patient S exhibits sensory ataxia: compensatory stomping with elevated heel-strike force and foot clearance, lower spatial $CV$ with eyes open but strong visual dependence. Eyes closed markedly increases variability in Patient S but only modestly affects Patient C; added cutaneous input reduces stomping in Patient S but does not substantially reduce irregular spatial variability in Patient C.**\n\nThis option accurately synthesizes the analysis above.\n- It correctly identifies Patient C as having cerebellar ataxia and correctly lists the supporting evidence: high variability (high $CV$), normal GRF, and minimal visual dependence.\n- It correctly identifies Patient S as having sensory ataxia and correctly lists the supporting evidence: compensatory stomping (elevated GRF) and high foot clearance, lower baseline variability, and strong visual dependence.\n- It correctly describes the differential effects of Manipulation $1$ (eyes closed) on the two patients.\n- It correctly describes the differential effects of Manipulation $2$ (cutaneous augmentation) on the two patients.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Both patients primarily depend on vision; heel-strike force does not reflect sensory compensation. Eyes closed similarly worsens variability in both. Added cutaneous input normalizes spatial variability in Patient C but has negligible effect in Patient S.**\n\nThis option contains multiple falsehoods.\n- \"Both patients primarily depend on vision\" is incorrect; Patient C shows only modest dependence.\n- \"heel-strike force does not reflect sensory compensation\" is incorrect; the $1.80$ BW GRF in Patient S is a textbook example of such compensation.\n- \"Eyes closed similarly worsens variability in both\" is incorrect; the effect is drastically different between the two.\n- \"Added cutaneous input normalizes spatial variability in Patient C\" is incorrect; the data state the change is minimal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Patient C exhibits sensory ataxia because irregular foot placement indicates trial-and-error compensation; Patient S exhibits cerebellar ataxia because stomping reflects dysmetria. Eyes closed should worsen both equally, and added cutaneous input should increase stomping.**\n\nThis option misdiagnoses both patients and misunderstands the pathophysiology.\n- Patient C cannot have sensory ataxia, as proprioceptive tests are normal. Irregular foot placement is a primary deficit of cerebellar ataxia (dysmetria), not a compensation for sensory loss.\n- Patient S cannot have cerebellar ataxia, as proprioceptive tests are severely abnormal and variability is low with eyes open. Stomping is compensation for sensory loss, not a form of dysmetria.\n- \"Eyes closed should worsen both equally\" is incorrect.\n- \"added cutaneous input should increase stomping\" contradicts both the data and the underlying principle; it should (and did) reduce the need for stomping.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Patient C exhibits cerebellar ataxia in which stomping enhances vestibular input; Patient S exhibits sensory ataxia with reduced heel-strike forces due to pain avoidance. Eyes closed has no meaningful effect on either; added cutaneous input increases variability in both.**\n\nThis option is riddled with factual errors.\n- Patient C is not stomping (GRF is $1.10$ BW). Stomping is a proprioceptive, not vestibular, compensation.\n- Patient S has *elevated* ($1.80$ BW) heel-strike forces, the opposite of what would be seen for pain avoidance.\n- \"Eyes closed has no meaningful effect on either\" is directly contradicted by the data from Manipulation $1$.\n- \"added cutaneous input increases variability in both\" is contradicted by the data from Manipulation $2$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4471613"}]}
