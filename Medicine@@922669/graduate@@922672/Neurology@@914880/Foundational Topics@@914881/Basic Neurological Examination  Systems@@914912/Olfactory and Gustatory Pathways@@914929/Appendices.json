Odorant molecules enter from the air at the air–mucus interface $x=0$, where inhalation maintains a constant mobile-phase concentration $C_{0}$ in the mucus. The ciliary layer at $x=L$ acts as a perfect sink for mobile-phase odorant, $C_{m}(L,t)=0$. In the mucus, odorant exists in a mobile phase of concentration $C_{m}(x,t)$ and a bound phase of concentration $C_{b}(x,t)$ due to fast, reversible binding to mucins. Assume linear, instantaneous binding with partition coefficient $K$, defined by $C_{b}(x,t) = K\\,C_{m}(x,t)$; thus hydrophobicity increases $K$.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is evaluated to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard one-dimensional reaction-diffusion model relevant to biophysics and poses answerable questions based on established physical principles.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as requested by the problem statement. First, we will derive the mean first-passage time $\\tau$. Second, we will determine the change in steady-state flux $J$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Mean First-Passage Time ($\\tau$)**\n\nWe begin by establishing the governing equation for the transport of odorant molecules. The total local concentration of odorant, $C_{total}(x,t)$, is the sum of the mobile-phase concentration, $C_{m}(x,t)$, and the bound-phase concentration, $C_{b}(x,t)$.\n$$C_{total}(x,t) = C_{m}(x,t) + C_{b}(x,t)$$\nThe problem states a linear, instantaneous binding equilibrium described by the partition coefficient $K$:\n$$C_{b}(x,t) = K C_{m}(x,t)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for total concentration gives:\n$$C_{total}(x,t) = C_{m}(x,t) + K C_{m}(x,t) = (1+K)C_{m}(x,t)$$\nThe conservation of total odorant is expressed by the continuity equation. Since only the mobile phase diffuses, the total flux, $J_{total}$, is equal to the flux of the mobile phase, $J_{m}$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial C_{total}}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J_{total}}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{\\partial J_{m}}{\\partial x}$$\nAccording to Fick's first law, the flux of the mobile phase is proportional to its concentration gradient:\n$$J_{m}(x,t) = -D \\frac{\\partial C_{m}}{\\partial x}$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of the mobile phase. Substituting this into the continuity equation yields Fick's second law for the system:\n$$\\frac{\\partial C_{total}}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-D \\frac{\\partial C_{m}}{\\partial x}\\right) = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C_{m}}{\\partial x^2}$$\nNow, we relate the time derivative of $C_{total}$ to the time derivative of $C_{m}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial C_{total}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left[(1+K)C_{m}\\right] = (1+K)\\frac{\\partial C_{m}}{\\partial t}$$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\frac{\\partial C_{total}}{\\partial t}$ gives:\n$$(1+K)\\frac{\\partial C_{m}}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C_{m}}{\\partial x^2}$$\nThis can be rewritten as a standard diffusion equation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial C_{m}}{\\partial t} = D_{eff} \\frac{\\partial^2 C_{m}}{\\partial x^2}$$\nwith an effective diffusion coefficient, $D_{eff}$, given by:\n$$D_{eff} = \\frac{D}{1+K}$$\nThis effective diffusion coefficient describes the overall transport process, which is slowed by the reversible binding to immobile mucins.\n\nNext, we derive the mean first-passage time, $\\tau$. The mean first-passage time $\\tau(x_0)$ for a particle starting at position $x_0$ to reach an absorbing boundary in a one-dimensional domain is governed by the Pontryagin equation:\n$$D_{eff} \\frac{d^2 \\tau}{dx_0^2} = -1$$\nThe problem specifies the boundary conditions for this single-particle stochastic process: a reflecting boundary at $x=0$ and an absorbing boundary at $x=L$. These translate to boundary conditions for $\\tau(x_0)$:\n1.  Reflecting boundary at $x_0=0$: $\\frac{d\\tau}{dx_0}\\Big|_{x_0=0} = 0$.\n2.  Absorbing boundary at $x_0=L$: $\\tau(L) = 0$.\n\nWe solve the differential equation by integrating twice. The first integration gives:\n$$\\frac{d\\tau}{dx_0} = -\\frac{x_0}{D_{eff}} + A$$\nwhere $A$ is an integration constant. Applying the reflecting boundary condition at $x_0=0$:\n$$\\frac{d\\tau}{dx_0}\\Big|_{x_0=0} = 0 \\implies -\\frac{0}{D_{eff}} + A = 0 \\implies A=0$$\nThe equation simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{d\\tau}{dx_0} = -\\frac{x_0}{D_{eff}}$$\nThe second integration yields:\n$$\\tau(x_0) = -\\frac{x_0^2}{2 D_{eff}} + B$$\nwhere $B$ is a second integration constant. Applying the absorbing boundary condition at $x_0=L$:\n$$\\tau(L) = 0 \\implies -\\frac{L^2}{2 D_{eff}} + B = 0 \\implies B = \\frac{L^2}{2 D_{eff}}$$\nThe general solution for the mean first-passage time from any starting point $x_0$ is:\n$$\\tau(x_0) = \\frac{L^2 - x_0^2}{2 D_{eff}}$$\nThe problem asks for the mean first-passage time for a molecule initially at $x=0$. We evaluate $\\tau(x_0)$ at $x_0=0$:\n$$\\tau = \\tau(0) = \\frac{L^2}{2 D_{eff}}$$\nTo explicitly show the dependence on viscosity $\\eta$ and partition coefficient $K$, we substitute the expressions for $D_{eff}$ and $D$:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{L^2(1+K)}{2 D} = \\frac{L^2(1+K)}{2 \\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{6 \\pi \\eta r}\\right)} = \\frac{3 \\pi \\eta r L^2 (1+K)}{k_{B} T}$$\nThis expression shows that the mean first-passage time $\\tau$ is directly proportional to both the viscosity $\\eta$ and the factor $(1+K)$.\n\n**Part 2: Multiplicative Change Factor in Steady-State Flux ($J$)**\n\nWe now consider the macroscopic diffusion problem under steady-state conditions. In steady state, all time derivatives are zero, so $\\frac{\\partial C_{m}}{\\partial t} = 0$. The diffusion equation becomes:\n$$D_{eff} \\frac{d^2 C_{m}}{dx^2} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d^2 C_{m}}{dx^2} = 0$$\nNote that the factor $(1+K)$ is irrelevant for determining the steady-state concentration profile of the mobile phase, $C_m$. The steady-state flux, $J$, is constant throughout the slab. From Fick's first law:\n$$J = -D \\frac{dC_m}{dx}$$\nIntegrating $\\frac{d^2 C_m}{dx^2} = 0$ once gives $\\frac{dC_m}{dx} = C_1$, where $C_1$ is a constant. Thus, $J = -D C_1$.\nIntegrating a second time gives the linear concentration profile:\n$$C_m(x) = C_1 x + C_2$$\nThe relevant boundary conditions for this macroscopic problem are:\n1.  Constant concentration at $x=0$: $C_m(0) = C_0$.\n2.  Perfect sink at $x=L$: $C_m(L) = 0$.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition:\n$$C_m(0) = C_0 \\implies C_1(0) + C_2 = C_0 \\implies C_2 = C_0$$\nApplying the second boundary condition:\n$$C_m(L) = 0 \\implies C_1 L + C_0 = 0 \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{C_0}{L}$$\nThe steady-state flux $J$ is thus:\n$$J = -D C_1 = -D \\left(-\\frac{C_0}{L}\\right) = \\frac{D C_0}{L}$$\nNow, we substitute the Stokes-Einstein relation for $D = \\frac{k_{B} T}{6 \\pi \\eta r}$:\n$$J = \\frac{k_{B} T C_0}{6 \\pi \\eta r L}$$\nThis expression shows that the steady-state flux $J$ is inversely proportional to the mucus viscosity $\\eta$, i.e., $J \\propto \\frac{1}{\\eta}$. All other parameters ($k_B, T, C_0, r, L$) are held constant.\n\nLet the initial state be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final state by subscript $2$. We have an initial viscosity $\\eta_1$ and flux $J_1$. The viscosity is then increased by a factor of $2$, so the new viscosity is $\\eta_2 = 2 \\eta_1$. The corresponding new flux is $J_2$. The multiplicative change factor is the ratio $\\frac{J_2}{J_1}$.\n$$\\frac{J_2}{J_1} = \\frac{\\frac{k_{B} T C_0}{6 \\pi \\eta_2 r L}}{\\frac{k_{B} T C_0}{6 \\pi \\eta_1 r L}} = \\frac{\\eta_1}{\\eta_2}$$\nSubstituting $\\eta_2 = 2\\eta_1$:\n$$\\frac{J_2}{J_1} = \\frac{\\eta_1}{2\\eta_1} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nAs a decimal number, this factor is $0.5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5}$$", "id": "4511802"}, {"introduction": "The natural world rarely presents odorants in isolation; most smells are complex mixtures.

Without loss of generality, we assume $I_1 > I_2$. The condition for contrast enhancement is thus $y_1 > 0$ and $y_2 = 0$.\n\nLet's substitute the condition $y_2 = 0$ into the system of equations.\nFrom equation (1), we get:\n$$y_1 = \\big[I_1 - G(y_1 + 0)\\big]_{+} = [I_1 - Gy_1]_{+}$$\nFrom equation (2), we get:\n$$y_2 = 0 = \\big[I_2 - G(y_1 + 0)\\big]_{+} = [I_2 - Gy_1]_{+}$$\n\nNow we analyze these two resulting equations.\nFor the first equation, the condition $y_1 > 0$ implies that the argument of the $[\\cdot]_{+}$ function must be positive.\n$$I_1 - Gy_1 > 0$$\nThis leads to the linear equation for $y_1$:\n$$y_1 = I_1 - Gy_1$$\nSolving for $y_1$:\n$$y_1(1+G) = I_1$$\n$$y_1 = \\frac{I_1}{1+G}$$\nSince $I_1$ is an excitatory drive, we assume $I_1 > 0$.
