Primary afferent neurons from low-threshold mechanoreceptors have their cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia and their central processes enter the dorsal columns (fasciculus gracilis and fasciculus cuneatus).\n    2. These primary afferents ascend to the dorsal column nuclei (nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus) in the caudal medulla.\n    3. Second-order neurons arising from these nuclei decussate as internal arcuate fibers to form the medial lemniscus.\n    4. The medial lemniscus ascends to the Ventral Posterolateral (VPL) nucleus of the thalamus and then to primary somatosensory cortex.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the established criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on fundamental, universally accepted principles of neuroanatomy. The dorsal column–medial lemniscus (DCML) pathway, its function in carrying discriminative touch, vibration, and proprioception, and its specific anatomical course (ipsilateral ascent in the spinal cord, synapse in the caudal medulla, decussation, and contralateral ascent in the brainstem) are all cornerstones of neurological science. The clinical scenarios (spinal hemisection and medial medullary infarct) are classic and realistic examples used to illustrate these principles. **The problem is scientifically sound.**\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear and complete set of anatomical axioms (the \"Foundational Base\") and two distinct clinical cases. It directs the user to derive a specific conclusion (the laterality of deficits) based on these axioms. A unique and stable solution can be logically deduced from the provided information. **The problem is well-posed.**\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. It describes anatomical structures and clinical deficits without ambiguity or subjective bias. **The problem is objective.**\n\nAll criteria for a valid problem are met. There are no scientific or factual unsoundness, no missing information, and no ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## PRINCIPLE-BASED DERIVATION\n\nThe laterality of a sensory deficit resulting from a lesion in a long-tract pathway is determined by the location of the lesion relative to the point of decussation (midline crossing) of that pathway.\n\n1.  **Pathway Anatomy**: As stated in the foundational base, the dorsal column–medial lemniscus pathway follows a specific course.\n    -   **First-order neurons**: Enter the spinal cord and ascend *ipsilaterally* (on the same side) within the dorsal columns. For a signal originating from the left side of the body, the fibers ascend in the left dorsal column.\n    -   **Synapse and Decussation**: These first-order neurons synapse on second-order neurons in the dorsal column nuclei (nucleus gracilis and cuneatus) located in the caudal medulla. The axons of these second-order neurons, known as internal arcuate fibers, then *decussate* to the contralateral side.\n    -   **Second-order and Third-order neurons**: After decussating, the second-order neurons form the medial lemniscus and ascend through the brainstem on the side *contralateral* to their origin. They synapse in the thalamus (VPL), and third-order neurons project to the somatosensory cortex.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Patient 1 (Left Spinal Hemisection at $T_{10}$)**:\n    -   The lesion is at spinal level $T_{10}$.\n    -   At this level, the dorsal columns contain first-order afferent fibers that are ascending *ipsilaterally*.\n    -   The decussation for this pathway occurs much higher, in the caudal medulla.\n    -   Therefore, the lesion is *caudal* (below) the point of decussation.\n    -   A left-sided lesion at $T_{10}$ will damage the left dorsal column, which carries sensory information from the *left* side of the body (specifically, the leg and lower trunk, via the fasciculus gracilis).\n    -   The resulting deficit in discriminative touch, vibration, and conscious proprioception will be on the *left* side of the body, at and below level $T_{10}$. This is an **ipsilateral** deficit.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Patient 2 (Left Medial Medullary Infarct)**:\n    -   The lesion is in the caudal medulla and damages the left medial lemniscus.\n    -   The foundational base explicitly states that the medial lemniscus is formed by the second-order neurons *after* they have decussated.\n    -   Therefore, the lesion is *rostral* (above) the point of decussation.\n    -   The left medial lemniscus contains fibers that originated from the *right* dorsal column nuclei, which in turn received input from first-order neurons carrying sensation from the *right* side of the body.\n    -   A lesion of the left medial lemniscus will interrupt the flow of sensory information from the *right* side of the body to the thalamus and cortex.\n    -   The resulting deficit in discriminative touch, vibration, and conscious proprioception will be on the *right* side of the body. This is a **contralateral** deficit.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: A lesion of the dorsal columns in the spinal cord produces an ipsilateral deficit because the fibers have not yet crossed. A lesion of the medial lemniscus in the medulla (or anywhere rostral to it) produces a contralateral deficit because the fibers have already crossed.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. Primary dorsal column afferents cross the midline within the spinal cord via the anterior white commissure, so a left $T_{10}$ hemisection produces contralateral deficits, whereas a left medial medullary lesion is ipsilateral because it is below the crossing.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement contains multiple factual errors. The primary afferents of the dorsal column system ascend ipsilaterally and do not cross in the spinal cord. The anterior white commissure is the decussation site for the spinothalamic tract (pain and temperature), not the dorsal columns. The predicted laterality for both lesions is the reverse of the correct outcome.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. First-order dorsal column afferents ascend uncrossed to the dorsal column nuclei; the second-order neurons then decussate in the caudal medulla as internal arcuate fibers to form the medial lemniscus. Therefore, a left $T_{10}$ hemisection yields ipsilateral loss below the lesion, while a left medial medullary lesion of the medial lemniscus yields contralateral loss.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement perfectly aligns with the foundational principles and the derivation above. It correctly identifies that first-order neurons ascend uncrossed (ipsilaterally). It correctly locates the decussation in the caudal medulla where second-order neurons cross to form the medial lemniscus. Based on this correct anatomical premise, it correctly deduces that a spinal hemisection (pre-decussation) causes an ipsilateral deficit, while a lesion of the medial lemniscus (post-decussation) causes a contralateral deficit.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Dorsal column fibers decussate at the cervical spinal cord near $C_{5}$; thus, spinal lesions below $C_{5}$ are contralateral and medullary lesions are ipsilateral.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement incorrectly places the decussation in the cervical spinal cord. The decussation for the DCML pathway occurs in the caudal medulla. Consequently, the predicted laterality of the deficits is incorrect.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The medial lemniscus carries uncrossed first-order fibers, so both the left $T_{10}$ hemisection and the left medial medullary lesion produce ipsilateral deficits.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement is factually incorrect. The foundational base explicitly defines the medial lemniscus as being formed by *decussated second-order* neurons. It does not carry uncrossed first-order fibers. The prediction that both lesions cause ipsilateral deficits is therefore incorrect.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Somatotopic rotation within the medial lemniscus reverses laterality for distal limb representations, so the laterality depends on body part rather than lesion level, making spinal hemisection ipsilateral for trunk and contralateral for limbs, while medullary lesions are variable.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement introduces a confusing and incorrect principle. While the somatotopic map does rotate as the medial lemniscus ascends through the pons and midbrain, this rotation does not affect or \"reverse\" the laterality of the representation. The entire medial lemniscus on one side carries sensory information from the contralateral side of the body. The laterality of the deficit is fundamentally determined by whether the lesion is pre- or post-decussation, not by somatotopy.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4524410"}, {"introduction": "Beyond knowing where a pathway goes, a neuroscientist must understand how quickly signals travel through it.

Neuron Population and Preferred Orientations**\nThe model consists of a population of $N = 36$ cortical neurons. Each neuron $i$ is characterized by a preferred stimulus orientation, $\\theta_i$. These preferred orientations are evenly distributed over the orientation space, which is periodic with a period of $180^\\circ$.

Feedforward Response Model**\nThe baseline response of each neuron $i$ to a stimulus with orientation $\\theta$ is described by a feedforward tuning function $u_i(\\theta)$. This function is modeled as a von Mises-like profile, which captures periodic tuning, superimposed on a baseline firing rate. The factor of $2$ in the cosine argument correctly enforces the $180^\\circ$ periodicity required for orientation selectivity.\n$$\nu_i(\\theta) = r_0 + r_{\\max}\\exp\\left(\\kappa \\cos\\left(2\\,\\frac{\\pi}{180}\\,(\\theta - \\theta_i)\\right)\\right)\n$$\nHere, $r_0 = 5$ spikes/s is the baseline spontaneous activity, $r_{\\max} = 40$ spikes/s is the maximum response modulation above baseline, and $\\kappa = 3$ is a dimensionless concentration parameter that determines the sharpness of the tuning (i.e., the inverse of tuning width). The term $\\frac{\\pi}{180}$ converts the angle difference from degrees to radians for the trigonometric function.\n\n**3. Lateral Inhibition Model**\nThe feedforward responses are modulated by lateral inhibition within the cortical population. The strength of the connection from a neuron $j$ to a neuron $i$ is defined by a Gaussian function of the circular distance between their preferred orientations.\nThe circular distance $\\Delta\\theta_{ij}$ on the $180^\\circ$ orientation space is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta\\theta_{ij} = \\min\\left(|\\theta_i-\\theta_j|, 180^\\circ - |\\theta_i-\\theta_j|\\right)\n$$\nThe unnormalized inhibitory weight from neuron $j$ to neuron $i$ is:\n$$\nw_{unorm}(\\Delta\\theta_{ij}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\Delta\\theta_{ij})^2}{2\\,\\sigma_w^2}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_w$ is the spread of inhibition in degrees. As specified, for each receiving neuron $i$, these weights are normalized such that their sum over all input neurons $j$ is unity. The normalized weight $W_{ij}$ is:\n$$\nW_{ij} = \\frac{w_{unorm}(\\Delta\\theta_{ij})}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} w_{unorm}(\\Delta\\theta_{ik})}\n$$\nThe final mean firing rate of neuron $i$, $\\mu_i(\\theta)$, is computed by subtracting the weighted sum of activities of all neurons in the network from its own feedforward response. A half-wave rectification, represented by the $\\max(0, \\cdot)$ function, ensures that firing rates cannot be negative.\n$$\n\\mu_i(\\theta) = \\max\\left(0,\\,u_i(\\theta) - \\alpha \\sum_{j=1}^{N} W_{ij}\\,u_j(\\theta)\\right)\n$$\nThe parameter $\\alpha \\ge 0$ is a dimensionless factor that controls the overall strength of the lateral inhibition.\n\n**4. Neuronal Noise Model**\nNeural responses are inherently noisy. The model assumes that the variability of each neuron's response is independent and that its variance, $\\sigma_i^2(\\theta)$, is an affine function of its mean firing rate, $\\mu_i(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\sigma_i^2(\\theta) = \\phi\\,\\mu_i(\\theta) + \\sigma_0^2\n$$\nHere, $\\phi$ is a dimensionless Fano-like factor scaling the variance with the mean, and $\\sigma_0^2$ (from the parameter $\\sigma_0$ in units of spikes/s) is a baseline additive variance term.\n\n**5. Discrimination Acuity and Fisher Information**\nThe ability of the neural population to discriminate between two nearby orientations is quantified by the Cramér–Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). The CRLB provides the minimum possible variance for any unbiased estimator of the orientation $\\theta$. Its inverse square root gives the just-noticeable difference (JND). The calculation relies on the Fisher information, $J(\\theta)$, which measures how much information the population's response carries about the stimulus parameter $\\theta$. For independent neurons, it is the sum of the information from each neuron:\n$$\nJ(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu_i(\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)^2}{\\sigma_i^2(\\theta)}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\partial \\mu_i(\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta}$ is the sensitivity of neuron $i$'s mean response to a small change in orientation. This derivative is computed numerically using a central difference approximation with a small step size $\\delta\\theta = 0.1^\\circ$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mu_i(\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta} \\approx \\frac{\\mu_i(\\theta+\\delta\\theta) - \\mu_i(\\theta-\\delta\\theta)}{2\\,\\delta\\theta}\n$$\nFinally, the JND, denoted $\\delta\\theta_{\\text{CRLB}}$, is calculated as:\n$$\n\\delta\\theta_{\\text{CRLB}}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{J(\\theta)}}\n$$\nThis value represents the smallest change in orientation that can be reliably detected by an ideal observer of the neural population activity, and is expressed in degrees.\n\n**Algorithmic Implementation**\nThe solution is implemented by a Python script using the `numpy` library for efficient vectorized computations. For each of the eight test cases, the following steps are performed:\n1. Unpack the parameters $(\\alpha, \\sigma_w, \\phi, \\sigma_0)$ for the current case.\n2. Pre-compute the $N \\times N$ matrix of normalized inhibitory weights, $W_{ij}$, based on the given $\\sigma_w$.\n3. Define a function that calculates the vector of mean responses, $\\mu(\\theta) = \\{\\mu_1(\\theta), \\dots, \\mu_N(\\theta)\\}$, for any given stimulus orientation $\\theta$. This function encapsulates the computation of feedforward responses $u_i(\\theta)$ and the subsequent application of lateral inhibition.\n4. Calculate the derivatives $\\frac{\\partial \\mu_i}{\\partial \\theta}$ at the test orientation $\\theta = 0^\\circ$ by calling the mean response function for $\\theta+\\delta\\theta$ and $\\theta-\\delta\\theta$ and applying the central difference formula.\n5. Calculate the variances $\\sigma_i^2(0^\\circ)$ using the mean responses $\\mu_i(0^\\circ)$.\n6. Compute the total Fisher Information $J(0^\\circ)$ by summing the contributions from each neuron.\n7. Calculate the JND as $1/\\sqrt{J(0^\\circ)}$, round the result to three decimal places, and store it.\nAfter iterating through all test cases, the list of JNDs is printed in the specified format.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes orientation discrimination JND for a model of S1 neurons.\n\n    This function implements a computational model of a population of\n    orientation-tuned neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1).\n    It evaluates the just-noticeable difference (JND) in orientation\n    discrimination under various conditions of lateral inhibition and noise,\n    based on the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- 1.
