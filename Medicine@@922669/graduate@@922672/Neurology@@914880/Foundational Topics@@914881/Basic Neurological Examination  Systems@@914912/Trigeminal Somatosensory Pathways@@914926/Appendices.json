We begin with the provided model for conduction velocity:\n$$v \\approx \\frac{\\ell}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nWe are also given the linear morphometric scaling for the internodal distance $\\ell$:\n$$\\ell = c_{\\ell}\\, d$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\ell$ into the equation for $v$, we obtain:\n$$v \\approx \\frac{c_{\\ell}\\, d}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nThe parameters $c_{\\ell}$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ are given as constants for the class of fibers under consideration.

We must be meticulous with unit conversions to obtain the final answer in $\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nThe given diameter is $d = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nUsing the morphometric scaling rule, $\\ell = c_{\\ell}\\, d$, where $c_{\\ell} = 100$. The problem states that if $d$ is given in $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, this rule yields $\\ell$ in $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\\ell = 100 \\times (10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = 1000\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nTo calculate the velocity in $\\mathrm{m/s}$, we must express all length dimensions in meters ($\\mathrm{m}$) and time in seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$). The conversion from micrometers to meters is $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$\\ell = 1000 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nThe effective cycle time is given as $\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1.70 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nNow we can compute the velocity $v$ using the primary model:\n$$v \\approx \\frac{\\ell}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{1.70 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s}}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$v \\approx \\frac{1}{1.70} \\times 10^{-3 - (-5)}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\n$$v \\approx \\frac{1}{1.70} \\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\n$$v \\approx \\frac{100}{1.70}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\n$$v \\approx 58.823529... \\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

Spatial acuity, which we can denote as $A$, is inversely related to this threshold: $A \\propto 1/\\Delta x$. A smaller threshold means higher acuity.\n\nThe problem states two key relationships:\n1.  \"spatial acuity scales with the square root of total information from independent afferents.\" Let $I$ be the total information. This statement can be written as:\n    $$ A \\propto \\sqrt{I} $$\n2.  \"the information available for spatial localization increases with the number of independent, similarly tuned sensors sampling the stimulus.\" The number of sensors in a given patch of skin is directly proportional to the afferent density, which we denote as $\\rho$. Therefore, the total information $I$ is proportional to the density $\\rho$:\n    $$ I \\propto \\rho $$\n\nCombining these two proportionalities, we can relate acuity directly to afferent density:\nSince $A \\propto \\sqrt{I}$ and $I \\propto \\rho$, it follows that $A \\propto \\sqrt{\\rho}$.\n\nNow, we can substitute the definition of acuity ($A \\propto 1/\\Delta x$) into this relationship:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\propto \\sqrt{\\rho} $$\nThis implies that the two-point discrimination threshold $\\Delta x$ is inversely proportional to the square root of the afferent density:\n$$ \\Delta x \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\rho}} $$\n\nWe can use this relationship to find the new threshold, $\\Delta x_2$, given the initial threshold, $\\Delta x_1$, and the change in density. Let $\\rho_1$ be the initial density and $\\rho_2$ be the new density. We can write the relationship as a ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta x_2}{\\Delta x_1} = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{\\rho_2}}{1/\\sqrt{\\rho_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2}} $$\n\nThe problem states the initial threshold is $\\Delta x_1 = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.

This means the new density $\\rho_2$ is $70\\%$ of the initial density $\\rho_1$:\n$$ \\rho_2 = (1 - 0.30)\\rho_1 = 0.70\\rho_1 $$\n\nNow we substitute this into our ratio equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta x_2}{\\Delta x_1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_1}{0.70\\rho_1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{0.70}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.70}} $$\n\nWe can now calculate the scaling factor:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.70}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.83666...} \\approx 1.1952... $$\nThe problem in option A approximates this factor as $1.20$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the new threshold $\\Delta x_2$:\n$$ \\Delta x_2 = \\Delta x_1 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.70}} \\right) \\approx 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\times 1.1952... \\approx 2.3904...\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nRounding this result to one decimal place gives $2.4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nThe derived qualitative relationship (threshold is inversely proportional to the square root of density) and the quantitative result (new threshold is approx. $2.4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) can now be used to evaluate the given options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. High Aβ receptor density and small receptive fields in the lip yield a small baseline threshold because many narrowly tuned units sample each location; if density is reduced by $30\\%$ with receptive field size unchanged, the threshold increases in proportion to $1/\\sqrt{\\text{density}}$, i.e., by a factor of $1/\\sqrt{0.70}\\approx 1.20$, so $2.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ becomes approximately $2.4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.**\n- **Mechanism:** The qualitative part accurately summarizes the principles of spatial acuity: high density and small receptive fields (narrow tuning) lead to good acuity (low threshold). This is consistent with principles (ii) and (iii).\n- **Quantitative Prediction:** The option states that the threshold increases in proportion to $1/\\sqrt{\\text{density}}$. This matches our derived relationship $\\Delta x \\propto 1/\\sqrt{\\rho}$. The calculation of the factor as $1/\\sqrt{0.70} \\approx 1.20$ is correct. The final predicted threshold of $2.4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ (from $2.0\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\times 1.20$) is also correct.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option accurately describes the underlying principles and correctly applies the quantitative model specified in the problem.\n\n**B. The threshold scales linearly with receptor density; a $30\\%$ reduction in density produces a $30\\%$ increase of the threshold, so $2.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ becomes $2.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.**\n- **Mechanism:** This option proposes that the threshold scales linearly with density. Specifically, it implies $\\Delta x \\propto 1/\\rho$. This contradicts the problem's premise that acuity ($1/\\Delta x$) scales with the *square root* of information (which is proportional to density). Our derivation showed $\\Delta x \\propto 1/\\sqrt{\\rho}$.\n- **Quantitative Prediction:** A $30\\%$ increase would yield $2.0\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\times 1.30 = 2.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. While the arithmetic is correct for the stated premise, the premise itself is flawed.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The scaling law proposed is inconsistent with the principles given in the problem statement.\n\n**C. Two-point threshold is set solely by receptive field size; density changes do not matter as long as at least one receptor is present under each point, so the threshold remains $2.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.**\n- **Mechanism:** This option incorrectly claims that density is irrelevant and that receptive field size is the *sole* determinant. This directly contradicts principle (ii), which states that information increases with the number of sensors, and the core concept of population coding. While receptive field size is critical, acuity is refined by the combined information from a population of receptors, making density a key factor.\n- **Quantitative Prediction:** The threshold is predicted to remain unchanged at $2.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. It disregards the explicitly stated role of sensor density and population coding.\n\n**D. Immediate cortical magnification compensates for peripheral loss, redistributing central resources to improve acuity; thus the threshold acutely decreases below $2.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.**\n- **Mechanism:** This option posits an immediate compensatory plasticity. Major changes in cortical maps (cortical magnification) are a form of long-term plasticity, not an acute response. The problem explicitly describes an \"acute\" block and asks for the \"acute change\". Furthermore, it states that \"central synaptic gain\" is not altered, which would be a primary mechanism for any rapid central compensation. A loss of sensory input should degrade, not improve, performance.\n- **Quantitative Prediction:** A decrease in threshold (improvement in acuity) is predicted, which is counterintuitive for a loss of sensory information.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. It invokes the wrong timescale for the proposed mechanism and predicts an effect in the wrong direction.\n\n**E. Because two points must be separated by at least twice a receptive field diameter to be resolved, any substantial density loss effectively doubles the required separation; thus the threshold doubles to $4.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.**\n- **Mechanism:** This option presents a highly oversimplified and generally incorrect \"rule\" about receptive field overlap. Nervous systems can achieve hyperacuity, resolving stimuli separated by a distance much smaller than the receptive field diameter, by using population codes. The claim that a $30\\%$ density loss would cause the threshold to double is arbitrary and not derived from the principles of information scaling given in the problem.\n- **Quantitative Prediction:** The threshold doubles to $4.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. It relies on a faulty premise about spatial resolution and an arbitrary quantitative leap.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4533159"}]}
