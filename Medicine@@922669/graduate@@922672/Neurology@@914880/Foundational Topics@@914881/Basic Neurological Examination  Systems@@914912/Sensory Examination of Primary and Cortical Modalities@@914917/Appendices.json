The time $t$ for any segment of length $L$ and conduction velocity $v$ is $t = L/v$. The total synaptic delay is the product of the number of synapses $N$ and the per-synapse delay $d_{\\text{syn}}$.\nTherefore, the full expression for reaction time is:\n$$\nT = \\frac{L_{\\text{aff}}}{v_{\\text{aff}}} + \\frac{L_{\\text{cen}}}{v_{\\text{cen}}} + \\frac{L_{\\text{eff}}}{v_{\\text{eff}}} + N \\cdot d_{\\text{syn}} + \\tau_{\\text{EMD}}\n$$\nThe two conditions described in the problem differ only in the afferent conduction velocity, $v_{\\text{aff}}$.\n\nFor A-delta fiber–mediated detection ($T_{A\\delta}$), the afferent velocity is $v_{\\text{aff}} = v_{A\\delta}$.

It is a standard application of Signal Detection Theory. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution: first, to derive an expression for sensitivity, $d'$, in terms of the hit rate, $H$, and the false alarm rate, $F$; second, to compute the numerical value of $d'$ for the given data and interpret the result.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the expression for $d'**\n\nThe hit rate, $H$, is the probability that the observer reports \"detected\" when a signal is present. This occurs when the decision variable $X$, drawn from the signal distribution $X_S \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{S}, \\sigma)$, exceeds the criterion $\\gamma$.\n$$H = \\Pr(X_S > \\gamma)$$\nTo express this in terms of the standard normal distribution, we standardize the variable $X_S$. Let $Z = \\frac{X_S - \\mu_S}{\\sigma}$, where $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\nThe inequality $X_S > \\gamma$ becomes $\\sigma Z + \\mu_S > \\gamma$, which rearranges to $Z > \\frac{\\gamma - \\mu_S}{\\sigma}$.\nThus, the hit rate is:\n$$H = \\Pr\\left(Z > \\frac{\\gamma - \\mu_S}{\\sigma}\\right)$$\nUsing the property of the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF), $\\Phi(z) = \\Pr(Z \\le z)$, we can write $\\Pr(Z > z) = 1 - \\Phi(z)$. By the symmetry of the Gaussian distribution, $1 - \\Phi(z) = \\Phi(-z)$.\n$$H = \\Phi\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma - \\mu_S}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu_S - \\gamma}{\\sigma}\\right)$$\nApplying the inverse standard normal CDF, $\\Phi^{-1}(\\cdot)$, to both sides of the equation yields:\n$$\\Phi^{-1}(H) = \\frac{\\mu_S - \\gamma}{\\sigma} \\quad (1)$$\n\nSimilarly, the false alarm rate, $F$, is the probability that the observer reports \"detected\" when only noise is present. This occurs when $X$, drawn from the noise distribution $X_N \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{N}, \\sigma)$, exceeds the criterion $\\gamma$.\n$$F = \\Pr(X_N > \\gamma)$$\nStandardizing the variable $X_N$ gives $Z = \\frac{X_N - \\mu_N}{\\sigma}$, where again $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\nThe inequality $X_N > \\gamma$ becomes $Z > \\frac{\\gamma - \\mu_N}{\\sigma}$.\nThe false alarm rate is:\n$$F = \\Pr\\left(Z > \\frac{\\gamma - \\mu_N}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(-\\frac{\\gamma - \\mu_N}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu_N - \\gamma}{\\sigma}\\right)$$\nApplying the inverse standard normal CDF to both sides gives:\n$$\\Phi^{-1}(F) = \\frac{\\mu_N - \\gamma}{\\sigma} \\quad (2)$$\n\nWe are asked to find an expression for sensitivity, defined as $d' = \\frac{\\mu_S - \\mu_N}{\\sigma}$. We can obtain this by subtracting equation $(2)$ from equation $(1)$:\n$$\\Phi^{-1}(H) - \\Phi^{-1}(F) = \\left(\\frac{\\mu_S - \\gamma}{\\sigma}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\mu_N - \\gamma}{\\sigma}\\right)$$\n$$\\Phi^{-1}(H) - \\Phi^{-1}(F) = \\frac{\\mu_S - \\gamma - \\mu_N + \\gamma}{\\sigma} = \\frac{\\mu_S - \\mu_N}{\\sigma}$$\nTherefore, the expression for $d'$ in terms of $H$ and $F$ is:\n$$d' = \\Phi^{-1}(H) - \\Phi^{-1}(F)$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation and Interpretation**\n\nWe are given the patient's performance data: a hit rate $H = 0.80$ and a false alarm rate $F = 0.20$. We use the derived formula to compute $d'$.\n$$d' = \\Phi^{-1}(0.80) - \\Phi^{-1}(0.20)$$\nWe need the values of the inverse standard normal CDF, which correspond to the z-scores for the given probabilities. Standard statistical tables or computational functions provide $\\Phi^{-1}(0.80) \\approx 0.84162$.\nFor $\\Phi^{-1}(0.20)$, we can use the symmetry property of the Gaussian distribution: $\\Phi^{-1}(p) = -\\Phi^{-1}(1-p)$.\n$$\\Phi^{-1}(0.20) = -\\Phi^{-1}(1 - 0.20) = -\\Phi^{-1}(0.80) \\approx -0.84162$$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $d'$:\n$$d' \\approx 0.84162 - (-0.84162) = 2 \\times 0.84162 = 1.68324$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the sensitivity is $d' = 1.683$.\n\nTo determine whether the performance is more consistent with reduced sensitivity or a liberal response bias, we must analyze the response bias. A common measure of response bias is the criterion placement, denoted $c$. A neutral bias corresponds to $c=0$, a liberal bias (tendency to say \"yes\") to $c<0$, and a conservative bias (tendency to say \"no\") to $c>0$. One definition for $c$ is:\n$$c = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\Phi^{-1}(H) + \\Phi^{-1}(F) \\right]$$\nUsing the patient's data:\n$$c = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\Phi^{-1}(0.80) + \\Phi^{-1}(0.20) \\right] \\approx -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 0.84162 + (-0.84162) \\right] = -\\frac{1}{2} [0] = 0$$\nA bias measure of $c=0$ indicates a perfectly neutral response strategy. The patient shows no tendency to over-report or under-report detections; their decision criterion is placed optimally to have no response bias. The performance pattern is therefore *not* consistent with a liberal response bias. Any deficit in performance must be attributed to the sensitivity parameter, $d'$. The value $d' \\approx 1.683$ represents a moderate but non-zero ability to distinguish the pinprick from its absence. If a healthy individual is expected to have a higher $d'$ (e.g., $d'>3$), then this patient's performance would be characterized purely by a reduced sensory sensitivity, as their decision-making bias is neutral.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.683}\n$$", "id": "4523792"}, {"introduction": "The art of clinical neurology lies in formulating a cogent differential diagnosis and dynamically weighing the likelihood of each possibility as new evidence becomes available.

This term is also known as the total probability or the evidence. It must be computed by marginalizing over all possible hypotheses.\n\nA necessary assumption for this computation is that the set of hypotheses $\\{\\mathrm{B12}, \\mathrm{tumor}, \\mathrm{neuropathy}\\}$ is both mutually exclusive (a patient cannot have two of these concurrently as the primary cause) and collectively exhaustive (these are the only three possible causes under consideration).
