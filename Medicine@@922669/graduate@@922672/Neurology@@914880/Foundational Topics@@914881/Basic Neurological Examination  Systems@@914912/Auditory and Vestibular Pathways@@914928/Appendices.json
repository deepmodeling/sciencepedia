This practice [@problem_id:4450381] challenges you to derive the tuning curve of a model neuron from first principles, connecting anatomical structure and stimulus timing to the neuron's firing rate.", "problem": "A foundational idea in binaural hearing is that neurons in the Medial Superior Olive (MSO) implement Interaural Time Difference (ITD) computation by comparing phase-locked inputs carried along axons with different conduction delays, as proposed by the Jeffress delay-line model. Consider an MSO coincidence detector neuron receiving one excitatory input from the left cochlear nucleus and one from the right cochlear nucleus. Each input is modeled as an independent inhomogeneous Poisson process that is phase-locked to a pure tone stimulus of frequency $f$. The left-ear generated input has instantaneous intensity $ \\lambda_{L}(t) = r \\left[ 1 + \\rho \\cos\\!\\left( 2\\pi f t \\right) \\right] $, and the right-ear generated input has instantaneous intensity $ \\lambda_{R}(t) = r \\left[ 1 + \\rho \\cos\\!\\left( 2\\pi f (t - \\delta t) \\right) \\right] $, where $r$ is the baseline firing rate, $\\rho$ is the modulation depth ($0 \\leq \\rho \\leq 1$) capturing phase-locking strength (vector strength), and $\\delta t$ is the Interaural Time Difference (ITD). Signals must propagate along axons to reach the MSO neuron; let the left axonal delay be $\\Delta_{L}$ and the right axonal delay be $\\Delta_{R}$. Define the Jeffress delay-line mismatch as $ \\Delta \\equiv \\Delta_{R} - \\Delta_{L} $. The MSO neuron acts as a coincidence detector that emits an output when a spike from the left input and a spike from the right input arrive within a short coincidence window of width $\\tau$, with $0 < \\tau \\ll \\frac{1}{f}$. Assume independence of the two inputs, stationarity over many stimulus periods, and that the coincidence probability in a small interval is the product of intensities times the window width.\n\nConstruct the Jeffress delay-line model for these inputs and derive, from fundamental definitions and without using any shortcut formulas, an analytic expression for the steady-state expected coincidence output rate of this MSO neuron as a function of the axonal delay mismatch $\\Delta$ and the stimulus ITD $\\delta t$, explicitly in terms of $r$, $\\rho$, $f$, $\\tau$, $\\Delta$, and $\\delta t$. Your final expression should be a closed-form analytic expression. No numerical evaluation is required, and no rounding is needed. Express your final answer as a single expression without units.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of computational neuroscience, is well-posed with a complete and consistent set of definitions and parameters, and is stated objectively. We can proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe goal is to find the steady-state expected coincidence output rate of a Medial Superior Olive (MSO) neuron. This rate depends on the arrival of phase-locked spikes from the left and right cochlear nuclei.\n\nFirst, we must determine the instantaneous firing rates of the inputs as they arrive at the MSO neuron. The problem specifies axonal propagation delays $\\Delta_{L}$ for the left input and $\\Delta_{R}$ for the right input. A spike generated at time $t$ at a cochlear nucleus arrives at the MSO at a later time $t'$. Therefore, to find the rate of spikes arriving at the MSO at time $t'$, we must evaluate the generation rate at the corresponding earlier time.\n\nFor the left input, a spike arriving at the MSO at time $t'$ must have been generated at the left cochlear nucleus at time $t = t' - \\Delta_{L}$. The instantaneous intensity of the left input as it arrives at the MSO is thus:\n$$ \\lambda_{L, \\text{MSO}}(t') = \\lambda_{L}(t' - \\Delta_{L}) = r \\left[ 1 + \\rho \\cos\\!\\left( 2\\pi f (t' - \\Delta_{L}) \\right) \\right] $$\n\nFor the right input, a spike arriving at the MSO at time $t'$ was generated at the right cochlear nucleus at time $t = t' - \\Delta_{R}$. The instantaneous intensity of the right input as it arrives at the MSO is:\n$$ \\lambda_{R, \\text{MSO}}(t') = \\lambda_{R}(t' - \\Delta_{R}) = r \\left[ 1 + \\rho \\cos\\!\\left( 2\\pi f ((t' - \\Delta_{R}) - \\delta t) \\right) \\right] $$\n\nThe MSO neuron functions as a coincidence detector. The problem provides a key modeling assumption: \"the coincidence probability in a small interval is the product of intensities times the window width.\" This, along with the independence of the inputs, allows us to define the instantaneous rate of coincidences, $R_c(t')$, as the product of the two instantaneous input intensities at the MSO multiplied by the coincidence window width $\\tau$.
