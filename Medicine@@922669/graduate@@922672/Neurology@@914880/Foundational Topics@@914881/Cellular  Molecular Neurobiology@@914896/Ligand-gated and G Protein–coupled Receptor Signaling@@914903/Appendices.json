The underlying physical principle is Ohm's law, applied to ion flow across a cell membrane, which is a standard and valid model in biophysics (the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz framework simplifies to this ohmic form under certain conditions). The problem is self-contained, with all necessary information provided, and contains no internal contradictions. The terminology is precise and standard. The problem is scientifically grounded and well-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of the instantaneous current through a single open $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ channel, and an explanation of the resulting effect on the membrane potential.\n\nThe relationship between current ($I$), conductance ($g$), and voltage ($V$) for an ohmic conductor is given by Ohm's law, $I = gV$. For an ion channel in a cell membrane, the voltage that drives the current is not the absolute membrane potential ($V_m$), but rather the electrochemical driving force. The driving force is the difference between the membrane potential ($V_m$) and the equilibrium potential (or reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$) for the ions passing through the channel. The reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is defined as the membrane potential at which there is no net flow of ions through the channel, and thus the net current is zero.\n\nThe current through a single ion channel, $I_{\\mathrm{channel}}$, can therefore be expressed as a product of its conductance, $g$, and the driving force, $(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$. This yields the equation:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{channel}} = g (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})\n$$\nThis formulation is consistent with the given current convention. A positive current corresponds to an outward flow of positive charge. If $V_m > E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ (e.g., for a cation channel), the driving force is positive, resulting in a positive current, which correctly represents the outward movement of cations. For an anion channel like the $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ receptor (selective for $\\text{Cl}^-$), if $V_m > E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$, the driving force is positive, the current is positive, and this represents an inward flow of anions ($\\text{Cl}^-$), which is equivalent to an outward flow of positive charge.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Single-channel conductance, $g = 20$ pS $= 20 \\times 10^{-12}$ S.\n- Membrane potential, $V_m = -65$ mV $= -65 \\times 10^{-3}$ V.\n- Reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = -70$ mV $= -70 \\times 10^{-3}$ V.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived current equation for the $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ channel ($I_{\\text{GABA}}$):\n$$\nI_{\\text{GABA}} = (20 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S}) \\times [(-65 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}) - (-70 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V})]\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the driving force:\n$$\nV_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = -65 \\text{ mV} - (-70 \\text{ mV}) = 5 \\text{ mV} = 5 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}\n$$\nNow, we compute the current:\n$$\nI_{\\text{GABA}} = (20 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ S}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V}) = 100 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ A}\n$$\nThe problem requests the current in picoamperes (pA), where $1 \\text{ pA} = 10^{-12} \\text{ A}$.\n$$\nI_{\\text{GABA}} = 100 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ A} = 0.1 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ A} = 0.1 \\text{ pA}\n$$\nRounding to two significant figures, the instantaneous current is $0.10$ pA.\n\nNext, we must explain whether the effect of opening this channel is depolarizing or hyperpolarizing. This can be determined from first principles in two equivalent ways.\n\n1.  **Based on the direction of current flow:**\n    We calculated a positive current, $I_{\\text{GABA}} = +0.10$ pA. The problem defines a positive current as \"net outward movement of positive charge (equivalently, inward movement of negative charge)\". Since the $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ receptor is a chloride ($\\text{Cl}^-$) channel, a positive current corresponds to an influx of negatively charged $\\text{Cl}^-$ ions into the neuron. An influx of negative charge increases the net internal negative charge of the cell, causing the membrane potential to become more negative. A shift in the membrane potential to a more negative value is, by definition, **hyperpolarization**.\n\n2.  **Based on the relationship between $V_m$ and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$:**\n    The effect of opening any ion channel is to drive the membrane potential, $V_m$, towards the reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$, for that channel's current. In this case, the initial membrane potential is $V_m = -65$ mV, and the $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ reversal potential is $E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = -70$ mV. Since the initial potential ($-65$ mV) is more positive than the reversal potential ($-70$ mV), opening the channel will cause the membrane potential to shift from $-65$ mV towards $-70$ mV. This movement to a more negative potential constitutes a **hyperpolarization**. This type of synaptic potential is known as an Inhibitory Post-Synaptic Potential (IPSP), as it moves the membrane potential further away from the typical threshold for firing an action potential.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.10}\n$$", "id": "4489641"}, {"introduction": "While simple models often assume channels are selective for a single ion, many physiological receptors are permeable to multiple ionic species.

The equilibrium dissociation constant $K_D$ for this reaction is given by the law of mass action:\n$$\nK_D(V_m) = \\frac{[S][\\text{Mg}^{2+}]}{[S \\cdot \\text{Mg}^{2+}]}\n$$\nThe fraction of unblocked receptors, $f_{\\text{unblocked}}$, is the concentration of unblocked sites divided by the total concentration of sites (unblocked plus blocked):\n$$\nf_{\\text{unblocked}} = \\frac{[S]}{[S] + [S \\cdot \\text{Mg}^{2+}]}\n$$\nFrom the definition of $K_D(V_m)$, we can express the concentration of blocked receptors as:\n$$\n[S \\cdot \\text{Mg}^{2+}] = \\frac{[S][\\text{Mg}^{2+}]}{K_D(V_m)}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $f_{\\text{unblocked}}$:\n$$\nf_{\\text{unblocked}} = \\frac{[S]}{[S] + \\frac{[S][\\text{Mg}^{2+}]}{K_D(V_m)}}\n$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $[S]$ yields the final expression:\n$$\nf_{\\text{unblocked}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[\\text{Mg}^{2+}]}{K_D(V_m)}}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation**\nFirst, we must calculate the value of the exponent in the Woodhull equation. It is critical to ensure all units are in the SI system for consistency. The membrane potential is given as $V_m = -65$ mV, which is $-65 \\times 10^{-3}$ V.\nThe exponent is $\\frac{z \\delta F V_m}{RT}$. We are given the values:\n$z\\delta = 1$ (dimensionless)\n$F = 96485$ C·mol$^{-1}$\n$V_m = -0.065$ V\n$R = 8.314$ J·mol$^{-1}$·K$^{-1}$\n$T = 310$ K\n\nThe argument of the exponential function is:\n$$\n\\frac{z \\delta F V_m}{RT} = \\frac{(1)(96485 \\, \\text{C·mol}^{-1})(-0.065 \\, \\text{V})}{(8.314 \\, \\text{J·mol}^{-1}·\\text{K}^{-1})(310 \\, \\text{K})} = \\frac{-6271.525}{2577.34} \\approx -2.43315\n$$\nNote that the units cancel, as $1$ J $= 1$ C·V.\n\nNext, we calculate the voltage-dependent dissociation constant, $K_D(V_m)$, using $K_D(0) = 3$ mM:\n$$\nK_D(V_m) = (3 \\, \\text{mM}) \\exp(-2.43315) \\approx (3 \\, \\text{mM})(0.08776) \\approx 0.26328 \\, \\text{mM}\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the fraction of unblocked receptors using $[\\text{Mg}^{2+}] = 1$ mM:\n$$\nf_{\\text{unblocked}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[\\text{Mg}^{2+}]}{K_D(V_m)}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1 \\, \\text{mM}}{0.26328 \\, \\text{mM}}}\n$$\n$$\nf_{\\text{unblocked}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 3.79819} = \\frac{1}{4.79819} \\approx 0.2084115\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.2084$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.2084}\n$$", "id": "4489617"}]}
