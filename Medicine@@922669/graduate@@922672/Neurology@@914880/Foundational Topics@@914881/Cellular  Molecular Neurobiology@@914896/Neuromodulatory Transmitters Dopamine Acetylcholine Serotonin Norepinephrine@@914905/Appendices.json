Serotonin, formally called 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), activates the ionotropic $5$-HT$_{3}$ receptor, which forms a nonselective cation channel. In contrast, dopamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine frequently act via metabotropic receptors to modulate conductances, but in this scenario only the $5$-HT$_{3}$ channel opens.\n\nAssume the following scientifically grounded conditions for an advanced graduate analysis:\n- The membrane is initially at a resting potential $V_{\\text{rest}}$ sustained by a passive leak conductance $g_{L}$ with leak reversal potential $E_{L}$.

The single-compartment model, the use of Ohm's law for membrane currents ($I = g(V-E)$), and the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz (GHK) voltage equation are all fundamental tools in this field. The specified ion concentrations, conductances, and resting potential are physiologically realistic for a mammalian neuron.

It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, and well-posed. The condition $E_{L} = V_{\\text{rest}}$ is a standard simplifying assumption for a neuron at rest where the leak current dominates and is near zero.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe neuron is modeled as a simple electrical circuit where the membrane potential $V_m$ is determined by the balance of currents flowing through parallel conductances. At any steady state, the net current across the membrane, $I_{\\text{net}}$, must be zero. This is a direct application of Kirchhoff's Current Law.\n\nInitially, at rest, only the leak conductance $g_L$ is active. The membrane is at the resting potential $V_{\\text{rest}}$. The leak current is given by Ohm's law:\n$$I_L = g_L (V_m - E_L)$$\nThe problem states that the leak current alone sets the resting potential, which implies that at $V_m = V_{\\text{rest}}$, the net current is zero. Since only $I_L$ is present, $I_L=0$. This requires $V_{\\text{rest}} = E_L$. Given $V_{\\text{rest}} = -68\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, we have $E_L = -68\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the $5$-HT$_{3}$ channels open, introducing a new conductance, $g$. The current through these channels is given by:\n$$I_{\\text{5HT3}} = g (V_m - E_{\\text{rev}})$$\nwhere $E_{\\text{rev}}$ is the reversal potential of the $5$-HT$_{3}$ channel.\n\nThe system evolves to a new steady-state membrane potential, which we will call $V_{\\text{final}}$. At this new steady state, the sum of all currents must again be zero:\n$$I_{\\text{net}} = I_L + I_{\\text{5HT3}} = 0$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the currents:\n$$g_L (V_{\\text{final}} - E_L) + g (V_{\\text{final}} - E_{\\text{rev}}) = 0$$\nWe can solve this algebraic equation for $V_{\\text{final}}$:\n$$g_L V_{\\text{final}} - g_L E_L + g V_{\\text{final}} - g E_{\\text{rev}} = 0$$\n$$V_{\\text{final}} (g_L + g) = g_L E_L + g E_{\\text{rev}}$$\n$$V_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{g_L E_L + g E_{\\text{rev}}}{g_L + g}$$\nThis equation shows that the final membrane potential is a weighted average of the reversal potentials of the active conductances.\n\nTo find $V_{\\text{final}}$, we must first calculate $E_{\\text{rev}}$ for the $5$-HT$_{3}$ channel. Since it is a nonselective cation channel permeable to Na$^+$ and K$^+$, its reversal potential is given by the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz (GHK) voltage equation:\n$$E_{\\text{rev}} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{Na}}[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{o} + P_{\\mathrm{K}}[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{o}}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}}[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{i} + P_{\\mathrm{K}}[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{i}} \\right)$$\nUsing the provided parameters: $V_T = \\frac{RT}{F} = 26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $P_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 1$, $P_{\\mathrm{K}} = 0.7$, and the given ionic concentrations:\n$$E_{\\text{rev}} = (26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{(1)(145\\,\\mathrm{mM}) + (0.7)(4\\,\\mathrm{mM})}{(1)(12\\,\\mathrm{mM}) + (0.7)(135\\,\\mathrm{mM})} \\right)$$\n$$E_{\\text{rev}} = (26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{145 + 2.8}{12 + 94.5} \\right)$$\n$$E_{\\text{rev}} = (26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln \\left( \\frac{147.8}{106.5} \\right)$$\n$$E_{\\text{rev}} \\approx (26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln(1.387793) \\approx (26.7\\,\\mathrm{mV})(0.327704) \\approx 8.7501\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n\nNow we can calculate $V_{\\text{final}}$ using the conductances $g_L = 30\\,\\mathrm{nS}$ and $g = 6\\,\\mathrm{nS}$, and the reversal potentials $E_L = -68\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and $E_{\\text{rev}} \\approx 8.7501\\,\\mathrm{mV}$:\n$$V_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{(30\\,\\mathrm{nS})(-68\\,\\mathrm{mV}) + (6\\,\\mathrm{nS})(8.7501\\,\\mathrm{mV})}{30\\,\\mathrm{nS} + 6\\,\\mathrm{nS}}$$\nThe units of conductance ($\\mathrm{nS}$) cancel out:\n$$V_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{(30)(-68) + (6)(8.7501)}{36}\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n$$V_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{-2040 + 52.5006}{36}\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n$$V_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{-1987.4994}{36}\\,\\mathrm{mV} \\approx -55.2083\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the change in membrane potential, $\\Delta V$, which is the difference between the final and initial potentials:\n$$\\Delta V = V_{\\text{final}} - V_{\\text{rest}}$$\n$$\\Delta V \\approx -55.2083\\,\\mathrm{mV} - (-68\\,\\mathrm{mV})$$\n$$\\Delta V \\approx 68 - 55.2083\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n$$\\Delta V \\approx 12.7917\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives:\n$$\\Delta V = 12.79\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nThe opening of the $5$-HT$_{3}$ channels, which have a positive reversal potential, causes a depolarization of the neuron by approximately $12.79\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12.79}$$", "id": "4505682"}, {"introduction": "A neuromodulator's influence is shaped not only by its release but also by how quickly it is cleared from the extracellular space.

You will use a kinetic model to reason about how the balance between transporter-mediated uptake and enzymatic degradation determines the temporal profile of a dopamine signal.", "problem": "A brief exogenous pulse of dopamine is applied in vivo to two regions in the same animal: the dorsal striatum and the medial prefrontal cortex. Extracellular dopamine concentration, denoted $[\\mathrm{DA}](t)$, is measured with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and is well fit in each region by a single-exponential decay following the peak. The dopamine transporter (DAT; dopamine transporter) density is known to be much higher in the dorsal striatum than in the medial prefrontal cortex, where the norepinephrine transporter (NET; norepinephrine transporter) also contributes to dopamine uptake. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT; catechol-O-methyltransferase) is expressed in both regions and acts primarily on extrasynaptic dopamine. A selective COMT inhibitor (for example, tolcapone) is administered at a dose that selectively blocks COMT activity without directly altering transporter kinetics.\n\nAssume that, over the relevant concentration range after the peak, each clearance pathway (DAT-mediated uptake, NET-mediated uptake, and COMT-mediated metabolism) can be approximated as an independent first-order process acting in parallel on $[\\mathrm{DA}](t)$, and that diffusion-driven loss is comparable across regions.

COMT inhibition will markedly increase $\\tau$ in striatum but produce little change in cortex, because norepinephrine transporter compensates for COMT blockade in cortex while dopamine transporter does not compensate in striatum.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the effect of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibition on the time constant, $\\tau$, of extracellular dopamine, $[\\mathrm{DA}](t)$, clearance in the dorsal striatum and the medial prefrontal cortex.\n\nThe problem states several key assumptions that allow us to construct a mathematical model of dopamine clearance. Specifically, dopamine clearance is modeled as a set of independent, parallel first-order processes. This means that the rate of change of the dopamine concentration, $\\frac{d[\\mathrm{DA}](t)}{dt}$, is the sum of the rates of each independent clearance pathway: transporter-mediated uptake by the dopamine transporter (DAT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), enzymatic degradation by COMT, and diffusion.\n\nA first-order process has a rate that is directly proportional to the concentration. Thus, the governing differential equation for $[\\mathrm{DA}](t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\mathrm{DA}]}{dt} = -k_{\\mathrm{DAT}}[\\mathrm{DA}] - k_{\\mathrm{NET}}[\\mathrm{DA}] - k_{\\mathrm{COMT}}[\\mathrm{DA}] - k_{\\mathrm{diffusion}}[\\mathrm{DA}]\n$$\nThis can be simplified by defining a total clearance rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{total}}$, which is the sum of the individual rate constants:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{total}} = k_{\\mathrm{DAT}} + k_{\\mathrm{NET}} + k_{\\mathrm{COMT}} + k_{\\mathrm{diffusion}}\n$$\nThe differential equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\mathrm{DA}]}{dt} = -k_{\\mathrm{total}}[\\mathrm{DA}]\n$$\nThe solution to this equation, for an initial concentration $[\\mathrm{DA}]_0$ at time $t=0$ (which we take as the peak concentration after the pulse), is a single-exponential decay:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{DA}](t) = [\\mathrm{DA}]_0 e^{-k_{\\mathrm{total}} t}\n$$\nThe problem defines the time constant $\\tau$ as the time required for $[\\mathrm{DA}](t)$ to fall to $1/e$ of its peak value. We can find the relationship between $\\tau$ and $k_{\\mathrm{total}}$ by setting $t=\\tau$ and $[\\mathrm{DA}](\\tau) = [\\mathrm{DA}]_0/e$:\n$$\n\\frac{[\\mathrm{DA}]_0}{e} = [\\mathrm{DA}]_0 e^{-k_{\\mathrm{total}} \\tau}\n$$\n$$\ne^{-1} = e^{-k_{\\mathrm{total}} \\tau}\n$$\n$$\n1 = k_{\\mathrm{total}} \\tau\n$$\nTherefore, the time constant is the reciprocal of the total clearance rate constant:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{DAT}} + k_{\\mathrm{NET}} + k_{\\mathrm{COMT}} + k_{\\mathrm{diffusion}}}\n$$\nNow, we apply this model to the two specified brain regions, incorporating the given biological facts.\n\n**1. Dorsal Striatum:**\n-   DAT density is \"much higher\". This implies that the rate constant for DAT-mediated uptake is very large: $k_{\\mathrm{DAT, striatum}}$ is large.\n-   NET is not mentioned as contributing to dopamine uptake in the striatum, which is consistent with its low expression there. We assume $k_{\\mathrm{NET, striatum}} \\approx 0$.\n-   COMT is expressed, so $k_{\\mathrm{COMT, striatum}}  0$.\n-   Diffusion contributes a term $k_{\\mathrm{diffusion}}$.\n\nThe total clearance rate constant in the striatum is:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{total, striatum}} \\approx k_{\\mathrm{DAT, striatum}} + k_{\\mathrm{COMT, striatum}} + k_{\\mathrm{diffusion}}\n$$\nBecause DAT density is much higher, DAT-mediated uptake is the dominant clearance mechanism. This means $k_{\\mathrm{DAT, striatum}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{COMT, striatum}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{DAT, striatum}} \\gg k_{\\mathrm{diffusion}}$. Thus, the total rate constant is dominated by the DAT term:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{total, striatum}} \\approx k_{\\mathrm{DAT, striatum}}\n$$\nThe time constant in the striatum is therefore:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{striatum}} \\approx \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{DAT, striatum}}}\n$$\n\n**2. Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC):**\n-   DAT density is much lower than in the striatum, so $k_{\\mathrm{DAT, cortex}}$ is a relatively small value.\n-   NET contributes to dopamine uptake, so $k_{\\mathrm{NET, cortex}}  0$.\n-   COMT is expressed, so $k_{\\mathrm{COMT, cortex}}  0$. COMT acts on extrasynaptic dopamine, and in a low-transporter environment like the cortex, dopamine can diffuse further, making the role of COMT more significant.\n-   Diffusion is comparable, so the $k_{\\mathrm{diffusion}}$ term is similar to that in the striatum.\n\nThe total clearance rate constant in the cortex is:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{total, cortex}} = k_{\\mathrm{DAT, cortex}} + k_{\\mathrm{NET, cortex}} + k_{\\mathrm{COMT, cortex}} + k_{\\mathrm{diffusion}}\n$$\nIn this case, no single term is as dominant as $k_{\\mathrm{DAT}}$ is in the striatum. $k_{\\mathrm{COMT, cortex}}$ represents a significant fraction of the total clearance rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{total, cortex}}$. The time constant in the cortex is:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{cortex}} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{DAT, cortex}} + k_{\\mathrm{NET, cortex}} + k_{\\mathrm{COMT, cortex}} + k_{\\mathrm{diffusion}}}\n$$\n\n**Effect of COMT Inhibition:**\nA selective COMT inhibitor blocks COMT activity, effectively setting $k_{\\mathrm{COMT}} \\approx 0$. Let $\\tau'$ be the new time constant after inhibition.\n$$\n\\tau' = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{DAT}} + k_{\\mathrm{NET}} + k_{\\mathrm{diffusion}}}\n$$\n-   **In the striatum:** The original time constant was $\\tau_{\\mathrm{striatum}} \\approx \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{DAT, striatum}}}$. After inhibition, $\\tau'_{\\mathrm{striatum}} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{DAT, striatum}} + k_{\\mathrm{diffusion}}}$. Since $k_{\\mathrm{COMT, striatum}}$ was a very small part of the total clearance rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{total, striatum}}$, its removal will cause only a very small decrease in the denominator, and thus a very small increase in $\\tau_{\\mathrm{striatum}}$. The change will be negligible.\n-   **In the cortex:** The original time constant was $\\tau_{\\mathrm{cortex}} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{total, cortex}}}$. After inhibition, the new denominator is $k'_{\\mathrm{total, cortex}} = k_{\\mathrm{total, cortex}} - k_{\\mathrm{COMT, cortex}}$. Because $k_{\\mathrm{COMT, cortex}}$ was a significant contributor to the total rate, its removal will cause a substantial decrease in the denominator. This will lead to a correspondingly large, or \"marked,\" increase in the time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{cortex}}$.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:** COMT inhibition is predicted to markedly increase $\\tau$ in the cortex and produce little to no change in $\\tau$ in the striatum.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. COMT inhibition will markedly increase τ in cortex but produce little to no change in striatum, because high dopamine transporter density in striatum makes transporter-mediated uptake dominate clearance there.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with our derived conclusion. It correctly identifies the differential effect in the two regions (large effect in cortex, small effect in striatum) and provides the correct underlying reason: the dominance of DAT-mediated clearance in the striatum renders the contribution of COMT negligible in that region. In the cortex, the lower transporter density makes the contribution of COMT to total clearance significant.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. COMT inhibition will shorten τ in cortex by reducing dopamine D$_2$ autoreceptor activation, but will have no effect in striatum due to lower COMT expression.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. First, inhibiting a clearance pathway slows down clearance, which means the time constant $\\tau$ will *increase* (lengthen), not shorten. Second, the prolonged presence of dopamine from COMT inhibition would *increase*, not reduce, D$_2$ autoreceptor activation. Third, the problem states COMT is expressed in both regions and does not provide information to suggest its expression is lower in the striatum. The primary reason for the lack of effect in the striatum is high DAT density, not low COMT expression.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. COMT inhibition will increase τ equally in cortex and striatum, because COMT is the dominant dopamine clearance pathway in both regions under physiological conditions.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The effect on $\\tau$ will not be equal because the relative contribution of COMT to total clearance is vastly different between the two regions. The premise that COMT is the dominant pathway in both regions is factually wrong; in the striatum, DAT is by far the dominant pathway.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. COMT inhibition will markedly increase τ in striatum but produce little change in cortex, because norepinephrine transporter compensates for COMT blockade in cortex while dopamine transporter does not compensate in striatum.**\nThis statement presents the opposite of the correct regional effects. The effect is large in the cortex and small in the striatum, not the other way around. The reasoning about \"compensation\" is also flawed. The problem is framed as a change in rate constants based on an acute blockade, not a chronic adaptation where transporters might upregulate. NET is a parallel pathway, not a compensatory one in the context of this model. It does not change its kinetics ($k_{\\mathrm{NET}}$) in response to COMT inhibition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4505740"}, {"introduction": "Neuromodulators are central to high-level cognitive functions like learning and decision-making, and computational models provide a powerful framework for understanding these roles.

The given values are $\\gamma = 0.93$ and $V(s) = 0.25$.\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb{E}[\\delta] = \\mathbb{E}[r] + \\gamma \\mathbb{E}[V(s')] - V(s) \\\\\n= 0.441 + (0.93)(0.39) - 0.25 \\\\\n= 0.441 + 0.3627 - 0.25 \\\\\n= 0.8037 - 0.25 \\\\\n= 0.5537\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the expected dopamine burst amplitude, $A_{\\mathrm{DA}}$, using the proportionality constant $\\kappa = 2.50$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA_{\\mathrm{DA}} = \\kappa \\,\\mathbb{E}[\\delta] \\\\\n= (2.50)(0.5537) \\\\\n= 1.38425\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Rounding $1.38425$ to four significant figures gives $1.384$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.384}$$", "id": "4505655"}]}
