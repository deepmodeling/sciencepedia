This section provides hands-on practice in applying quantitative reasoning to glial function. By working through these problems, you will develop the skills to model complex glial phenomena, estimate key biological parameters, and predict the functional consequences of glial activity and dysfunction. Astrocytes in the cortex are organized into distinct, non-overlapping territories, creating a cellular framework that tiles the neural parenchyma. This exercise invites you to translate a known population density into the dimensions of a single astrocyte's domain, a fundamental parameter for understanding its sphere of influence [@problem_id:4482412]. This practice in first-principles estimation provides a tangible sense of the spatial scale at which these crucial glial cells operate.", "problem": "In the cerebral cortex, protoplasmic astrocytes are observed to occupy largely non-overlapping territorial domains that tile the local neuropil.

It provides a realistic number density for astrocytes in the cerebral cortex and asks for a calculation based on a common and useful physical idealization—equating the volume of an idealized spherical domain to the average volume per particle. This approach is a standard first-principles method for estimating characteristic length scales in a system of distributed objects. All necessary data are provided, and the constraints are clear and consistent with the goal.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected radius of an astrocyte's territorial domain, given a specific number density. We will derive this from first principles as requested.\n\nThe fundamental definition of number density, $\\rho_N$, is the number of objects, $N$, per unit volume, $V$.\n$$ \\rho_N = \\frac{N}{V} $$\nFrom this definition, the average volume occupied by a single object (in this case, one astrocyte) is the reciprocal of the number density.

This is a modeling instruction to equate the volume of the idealized sphere with the average volume available per astrocyte.\n$$ V_{\\text{sphere}} = V_{\\text{astrocyte}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the volumes, we get:\n$$ \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3 = \\frac{1}{\\rho_N} $$\nWe can now solve for the radius $R$.
