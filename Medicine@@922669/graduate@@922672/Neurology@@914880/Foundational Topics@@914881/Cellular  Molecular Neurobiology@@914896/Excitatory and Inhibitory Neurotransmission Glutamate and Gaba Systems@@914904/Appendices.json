A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by calculating the individual excitatory and inhibitory currents and then summing them to find the net synaptic current. The governing equation for the current through a single type of ion channel with a linear conductance is given by:\n$$I = g(V - E_{rev})$$\nwhere $I$ is the current, $g$ is the conductance, $V$ is the membrane potential, and $E_{rev}$ is the reversal potential for the ions passing through the channel.\n\nThe net synaptic current, $I_{net}$, is the algebraic sum of the excitatory current, $I_{exc}$, and the inhibitory current, $I_{inh}$, as the conductances act in parallel.\n$$I_{net} = I_{exc} + I_{inh}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the excitatory current, $I_{exc}$, mediated by AMPA receptors. The given parameters are the excitatory conductance $g_{exc} = 1$ nS, the excitatory reversal potential $E_{exc} = 0$ mV, and the membrane potential $V = -65$ mV.\n$$I_{exc} = g_{exc}(V - E_{exc})$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$I_{exc} = (1 \\text{ nS}) \\times (-65 \\text{ mV} - 0 \\text{ mV}) = (1 \\text{ nS}) \\times (-65 \\text{ mV}) = -65 \\text{ nS} \\cdot \\text{mV}$$\nThe negative sign indicates an inward current of positive charge (an inward cationic current), which is expected as the membrane potential ($-65$ mV) is negative relative to the AMPA reversal potential ($0$ mV), driving cations into the cell.\n\nNext, we calculate the inhibitory current, $I_{inh}$, mediated by GABA$_A$ receptors. The given parameters are the inhibitory conductance $g_{inh} = 2$ nS and the inhibitory reversal potential $E_{inh} = -75$ mV.
