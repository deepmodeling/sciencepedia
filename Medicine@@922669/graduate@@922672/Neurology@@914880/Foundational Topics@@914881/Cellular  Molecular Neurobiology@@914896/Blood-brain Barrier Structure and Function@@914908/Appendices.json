It is based on the fundamental principles of mass transport, specifically Fick's laws of diffusion, which are standard in this context. The model of the blood-brain barrier as a homogeneous slab is a common and valid simplification for transport analysis. The given numerical values are physically plausible. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe derivation begins with Fick's first law of diffusion, which describes the molar flux density $j$ (amount per unit area per unit time) of a solute at a position $x$ within the diffusion barrier. Let the barrier have a thickness $L$, with the luminal (blood) interface at $x=0$ and the abluminal (brain) interface at $x=L$. Fick's law is given by:\n$$j(x) = -D \\frac{dC_m(x)}{dx}$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of the solute within the barrier material, and $C_m(x)$ is the concentration of the solute within the barrier at position $x$.\n\nThe problem states that the system is at steady state. At steady state, the flux density $j$ must be constant for all $x$ across the barrier, i.e., $j(x) = j$. This implies that the concentration gradient $\\frac{dC_m(x)}{dx}$ is also constant. Therefore, the concentration profile $C_m(x)$ is linear across the barrier. We can integrate the differential equation from $x=0$ to $x=L$:\n$$j \\int_{0}^{L} dx = -D \\int_{C_m(0)}^{C_m(L)} dC_m$$\n$$jL = -D (C_m(L) - C_m(0))$$\nRearranging for the flux density $j$ gives:\n$$j = \\frac{D}{L} (C_m(0) - C_m(L))$$\n\nThe solute concentration just inside the barrier interfaces, $C_m(0)$ and $C_m(L)$, is related to the concentrations in the adjacent aqueous phases (blood and brain interstitial fluid) through the partition coefficient, $K$. The partition coefficient is defined as the ratio of equilibrium concentrations in the membrane phase to the aqueous phase. Assuming local equilibrium at the interfaces:\n$$C_m(0) = K C_{luminal}$$\n$$C_m(L) = K C_{abluminal}$$\nHere, $C_{luminal}$ is the solute concentration in the blood, and $C_{abluminal}$ is the concentration in the brain interstitial fluid.\n\nSubstituting these relations into the expression for $j$:\n$$j = \\frac{D}{L} (K C_{luminal} - K C_{abluminal})$$\n$$j = \\frac{KD}{L} (C_{luminal} - C_{abluminal})$$\nThe term $(C_{luminal} - C_{abluminal})$ is the concentration difference across the barrier, given as $\\Delta C$.\n$$j = \\frac{KD}{L} \\Delta C$$\n\nThe problem introduces the effective permeability, $P$, which is defined by the standard membrane transport idealization. This relates the flux density $j$ directly to the concentration difference in the aqueous phases:\n$$j = P \\Delta C$$\n\nBy comparing the two derived expressions for $j$, we see that for a homogeneous slab model, the permeability $P$ is a composite parameter given by:\n$$P = \\frac{KD}{L}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the total molar flux, $J$, across the entire capillary surface area, $S$. The total flux is the flux density (flux per unit area) multiplied by the total area:\n$$J = j \\cdot S$$\nSubstituting the definition of permeability, $j = P \\Delta C$, we arrive at the first requested result, an expression for $J$ in terms of $P$, $S$, and $\\Delta C$:\n$$J = P S \\Delta C$$\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $J$ using the provided data:\n$P = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{cm/s}$\n$S = 100\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$\n$\\Delta C = 50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency, we must convert the units to a base system.

It contains all necessary information for deriving a unique and meaningful solution. The problem models the passive diffusion of a weak base across a biological membrane, a classic scenario in pharmacokinetics governed by the pH-partition hypothesis. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we must derive an expression for the fraction of the drug present in its unionized, base form, denoted as $f_{u}(pH)$. The drug is a weak base, which we represent as $B$. In an aqueous solution, it exists in equilibrium with its protonated (conjugate acid) form, $BH^{+}$.

The problem states that membrane crossing follows Fickian behavior and only the unionized species, $B$, permeates. Assuming sink conditions (negligible drug concentration on the abluminal side), the flux, $J$, across the membrane is proportional to the concentration of the unionized species in the luminal aqueous phase, $[B]_{luminal}$:\n$$J = P_{0} [B]_{luminal}$$\nwhere $P_{0}$ is the intrinsic permeability constant for the unionized form.

When both are present, they experience the same applied transepithelial potential difference. This is the definition of a parallel circuit arrangement. Let the applied potential difference be $V$.\n\nAccording to Ohm's law, the current $I$ flowing through a resistor $R$ under a potential difference $V$ is given by $V = IR$, or equivalently, $I = V/R$.\n\nFor route $1$, the current $I_1$ is:\n$$I_1 = \\frac{V}{R_1}$$\n\nFor route $2$, the current $I_2$ is:\n$$I_2 = \\frac{V}{R_2}$$\n\nThe principle of conservation of charge dictates that the total current, $I_{total}$, passing through the monolayer is the sum of the currents through the individual independent pathways.\n$$I_{total} = I_1 + I_2$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $I_1$ and $I_2$:\n$$I_{total} = \\frac{V}{R_1} + \\frac{V}{R_2}$$\n\nWe can factor out the common potential difference $V$:\n$$I_{total} = V \\left( \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} \\right)$$\n\nThe effective TEER of the combined monolayer, let's call it $R_{eff}$, relates the total current $I_{total}$ to the applied potential $V$ via Ohm's law for the entire system:\n$$V = I_{total} R_{eff}$$\nThis can be rearranged to express the total current as:\n$$I_{total} = \\frac{V}{R_{eff}}$$\n\nEquating the two expressions for $I_{total}$:\n$$\\frac{V}{R_{eff}} = V \\left( \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} \\right)$$\n\nSince $V$ represents a non-zero applied potential, we can divide both sides by $V$ to obtain the relationship between the resistances:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_{eff}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the effective TEER in terms of the individual route resistances.\n\nAlternatively, using the definition of conductance $G = 1/R$, the conductances of the two routes are $G_1 = 1/R_1$ and $G_2 = 1/R_2$. The total conductance $G_{eff}$ for parallel pathways is the sum of the individual conductances: $G_{eff} = G_1 + G_2$. Since the effective resistance is the reciprocal of the effective conductance, $R_{eff} = 1/G_{eff}$, we arrive at the same expression: $1/R_{eff} = 1/R_1 + 1/R_2$.\n\nTo find an explicit formula for $R_{eff}$, we can solve this equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_{eff}} = \\frac{R_2 + R_1}{R_1 R_2}$$\n$$R_{eff} = \\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$$\nThis is the final derived expression for the effective TEER.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the given data: $R_1 = 1500\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ and $R_2 = 3000\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.\n$$R_{eff} = \\frac{(1500)(3000)}{1500 + 3000}$$\n$$R_{eff} = \\frac{4500000}{4500}$$\n$$R_{eff} = 1000$$\nThe units of the result are the same as the units of the input resistances, $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.
