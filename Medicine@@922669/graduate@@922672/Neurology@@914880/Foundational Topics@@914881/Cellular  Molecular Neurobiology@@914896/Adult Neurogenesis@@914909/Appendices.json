By applying first principles of asynchronous cell populations, you will see how a cleverly designed experiment allows us to infer a dynamic cellular property from a static snapshot of the tissue.", "problem": "Adult hippocampal dentate gyrus progenitor cells proliferate asynchronously in vivo. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporates into deoxyribonucleic acid during the deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis phase (S-phase) only while it is present. Consider a double-pulse labeling paradigm in which two infinitesimally short BrdU pulses are delivered at times $t=0$ and $t=\\Delta t$, with $\\Delta t > 0$. Assume a steady-state, ergodic population with the following properties: (i) each cell’s S-phase has fixed duration $T_s$ (constant across the subpopulation under study), (ii) pulses are of negligible duration compared to $T_s$ yet saturating, so a cell is labeled by a pulse if and only if it is in S-phase at the pulse time, (iii) label detection is perfect and labels persist through the remainder of S-phase without loss, and (iv) there are no cell losses between pulses in the subpopulation assessed.\n\nDefine a “double-labeled” cell as one that incorporates BrdU at both pulses. Let $f$ denote the empirically measured fraction of cells labeled by the second pulse at time $t=\\Delta t$ that are also labeled by the first pulse, i.e., the fraction of double-labeled among second-pulse-labeled cells. Starting from first principles about asynchronous renewal processes and the definition of S-phase occupancy, derive the expected dependence of the double-labeled fraction on $\\Delta t$ and $T_s$. Then, under the regime $0  \\Delta t  T_s$, express $T_s$ in terms of the measured fraction $f$ and the interval $\\Delta t$ as a single closed-form analytic expression. No numerical evaluation is required; report the final expression with no units and no rounding.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the S-phase duration, $T_s$, from a double-pulse labeling experiment. We begin by formalizing the system based on the provided assumptions.\n\nThe population of progenitor cells is described as asynchronous and in a steady state. This implies that cell cycle events, such as entry into S-phase, occur at a constant rate over time, and the distribution of cells across the different phases of the cycle is time-invariant. The S-phase is of a fixed duration, $T_s$, for all cells in the population under study.\n\nLet $f$ be the fraction of cells labeled by the second BrdU pulse (at $t=\\Delta t$) that are also labeled by the first pulse (at $t=0$). This can be interpreted as a conditional probability:\n$$f = P(\\text{cell is in S-phase at } t=0 \\mid \\text{cell is in S-phase at } t=\\Delta t)$$\n\nConsider a cell that is labeled by the second pulse. This means it is in S-phase at time $t=\\Delta t$. Let us define a random variable $\\tau$ as the time this cell has already spent in S-phase at the moment of the second pulse. This is the cell's \"age\" within S-phase. Since a cell is, by definition, in S-phase for a duration of $T_s$, the possible values for $\\tau$ for this cell are in the interval $[0, T_s)$.\n\nThe \"asynchronous\" and \"steady-state\" assumptions signify that for the population of cells in S-phase at any given instant, the distribution of ages, $\\tau$, is uniform. Therefore, the probability density function (PDF) of $\\tau$ is:\n$$p(\\tau) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{T_s}  \\text{if } 0 \\le \\tau  T_s \\\\ 0  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\n\nA cell with S-phase age $\\tau$ at time $t=\\Delta t$ must have entered S-phase at time $t_{enter} = \\Delta t - \\tau$. For this cell to have also been labeled by the first pulse at $t=0$, it must have been in S-phase at $t=0$. The condition for a cell being in S-phase at time $t=0$ is that its entry time $t_{enter}$ and exit time $t_{exit} = t_{enter} + T_s$ must bracket $t=0$:\n$$t_{enter} \\le 0  t_{exit}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $t_{enter}$ and $t_{exit}$ in terms of $\\tau$:\n$$\\Delta t - \\tau \\le 0 \\implies \\tau \\ge \\Delta t$$\n$$0  (\\Delta t - \\tau) + T_s \\implies \\tau  \\Delta t + T_s$$\nSo, a cell that is in S-phase at $t=\\Delta t$ was also in S-phase at $t=0$ if and only if its S-phase age $\\tau$ at time $t=\\Delta t$ satisfies $\\Delta t \\le \\tau  \\Delta t + T_s$.\n\nThe fraction $f$ is the probability that $\\tau$ falls within this range, given that $\\tau$ is in $[0, T_s)$. We calculate this by integrating the PDF $p(\\tau)$ over the intersection of the two intervals: $[\\Delta t, \\Delta t + T_s)$ and $[0, T_s)$.\n\nThe problem specifies the regime $0  \\Delta t  T_s$. In this regime, the intersection of the intervals is $[\\Delta t, T_s)$. The fraction $f$ is thus:\n$$f = \\int_{\\Delta t}^{T_s} p(\\tau) \\,d\\tau = \\int_{\\Delta t}^{T_s} \\frac{1}{T_s} \\,d\\tau$$\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{T_s} [\\tau]_{\\Delta t}^{T_s} = \\frac{1}{T_s} (T_s - \\Delta t) = 1 - \\frac{\\Delta t}{T_s}$$\nThis equation gives the dependence of the double-labeled fraction $f$ on the inter-pulse interval $\\Delta t$ and the S-phase duration $T_s$. If $\\Delta t \\ge T_s$, the intersection of the intervals is empty, and $f=0$, which is physically correct as no cell can span an interval longer than its S-phase duration.\n\nThe final step is to solve for $T_s$ in terms of the experimentally measured quantities $f$ and $\\Delta t$ for the regime $0  \\Delta t  T_s$. We rearrange the expression for $f$:\n$$ f = 1 - \\frac{\\Delta t}{T_s} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta t}{T_s} = 1 - f $$\nFor a non-zero interval $\\Delta t  0$, we have $f  1$, so $1 - f \\ne 0$. Therefore, we can solve for $T_s$:\n$$ T_s = \\frac{\\Delta t}{1 - f} $$\nThis is the required single closed-form analytic expression for $T_s$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\Delta t}{1 - f}}$$", "id": "4445541"}, {"introduction": "The journey of a newborn neuron does not end with its birth; it must survive and mature, a process critically dependent on extrinsic signals like Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF).

In a controlled in vitro assay of adult-born granule cell survival, suppose the survival probability is governed by receptor occupancy and a saturating transduction: the fraction of occupied TrkB binding sites is given by the standard one-site binding relation, and the incremental survival effect scales linearly with occupancy up to a maximal increment beyond a baseline.

It describes a standard biophysical model of ligand-receptor binding and dose-response pharmacology applied to the context of neurotrophic factor signaling in adult neurogenesis. All necessary parameters and conditions for deriving the model and calculating the requested value are provided.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts: first, the derivation of the survival probability function; second, the biophysical interpretation of the model parameters; and third, the calculation of the specific BDNF concentration.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Survival Probability Function $S([\\text{BDNF}])$\n\nThe problem states that the fraction of occupied Tropomyosin receptor kinase B ($\\text{TrkB}$) receptors, denoted by $\\theta$, follows the standard one-site binding relation for a ligand (BDNF) with concentration $[\\text{BDNF}]$ and a half-saturation constant $K$. With a Hill coefficient $n=1$, this relation is given by the Michaelis-Menten or Hill equation:\n$$\n\\theta([\\text{BDNF}]) = \\frac{[\\text{BDNF}]}{K + [\\text{BDNF}]}\n$$\nThe total survival probability, $S([\\text{BDNF}])$, is the sum of a baseline survival probability in the absence of BDNF, $S_0$, and an incremental survival effect, $\\Delta S$, which is dependent on BDNF concentration.\n$$\nS([\\text{BDNF}]) = S_0 + \\Delta S([\\text{BDNF}])\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the incremental survival effect, $\\Delta S$, scales linearly with receptor occupancy, $\\theta$. This implies a relationship of the form $\\Delta S = c \\cdot \\theta$, where $c$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nTo determine the constant $c$, we use the condition that at saturating concentrations of BDNF ($[\\text{BDNF}] \\to \\infty$), the receptor occupancy $\\theta$ approaches $1$, and the incremental survival effect reaches its maximum value, $S_{\\max}$.\n$$\n\\lim_{[\\text{BDNF}] \\to \\infty} \\theta([\\text{BDNF}]) = \\lim_{[\\text{BDNF}] \\to \\infty} \\frac{[\\text{BDNF}]}{K + [\\text{BDNF}]} = 1\n$$\nAt this limit, $\\Delta S = S_{\\max}$. Substituting these into the linear relationship gives $S_{\\max} = c \\cdot 1$, so the proportionality constant is $c = S_{\\max}$.\n\nTherefore, the incremental survival effect is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta S([\\text{BDNF}]) = S_{\\max} \\cdot \\theta([\\text{BDNF}]) = S_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{[\\text{BDNF}]}{K + [\\text{BDNF}]} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this expression back into the equation for the total survival probability yields the final functional form:\n$$\nS([\\text{BDNF}]) = S_0 + S_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{[\\text{BDNF}]}{K + [\\text{BDNF}]} \\right)\n$$\nThis equation is the standard form of a pharmacological dose-response curve with a non-zero baseline.\n\n### Part 2: Interpretation of Parameters $K$ and $S_{\\max}$\n\n1.  **$S_{\\max}$ (Maximal Increment)**: This parameter represents the maximum possible increase in survival probability that can be mediated by the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway. It is the difference between the maximum possible survival probability at saturating BDNF levels ($S_0 + S_{\\max}$) and the baseline survival probability ($S_0$). In biophysical terms, $S_{\\max}$ quantifies the **efficacy** of BDNF as a survival-promoting factor for these specific neurons. It is the full capacity of this particular signaling system to enhance cell survival.\n\n2.  **$K$ (Half-Saturation Constant)**: This parameter has units of concentration. The problem states it is the half-effect concentration. We can verify this. The incremental effect is $\\Delta S = S_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{[\\text{BDNF}]}{K + [\\text{BDNF}]} \\right)$. We seek the concentration $[\\text{BDNF}]$ at which this incremental effect is one-half of its maximum, i.e., $\\Delta S = \\frac{S_{\\max}}{2}$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{S_{\\max}}{2} = S_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{[\\text{BDNF}]}{K + [\\text{BDNF}]} \\right)\n    $$\n    Assuming $S_{\\max} \\neq 0$, we can divide by $S_{\\max}$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{[\\text{BDNF}]}{K + [\\text{BDNF}]}\n    $$\n    $$\n    K + [\\text{BDNF}] = 2[\\text{BDNF}]\n    $$\n    $$\n    [\\text{BDNF}] = K\n    $$\n    Thus, $K$ is precisely the concentration of BDNF required to achieve half of the maximal incremental survival effect. This is also known as the EC50 (half maximal effective concentration). Biophysically, $K$ is a measure of the **potency** of BDNF and reflects the affinity of the BDNF ligand for its TrkB receptor. A lower value of $K$ signifies a higher affinity, as a lower concentration of ligand is needed to elicit a half-maximal response.\n\n### Part 3: Calculation of the Target BDNF Concentration\n\nThe problem provides the following experimental values:\n-   Baseline survival probability, $S_0 = 0.35$.\n-   Saturating survival probability, $S_0 + S_{\\max} = 0.80$.\n-   Half-effect concentration, $K = 3$ nM.\n-   Target survival probability, $S^{*} = 0.65$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the maximal increment $S_{\\max}$:\n$$\nS_{\\max} = (S_0 + S_{\\max}) - S_0 = 0.80 - 0.35 = 0.45\n$$\nNow we have all the parameters for our derived model:\n$$\nS([\\text{BDNF}]) = 0.35 + 0.45 \\left( \\frac{[\\text{BDNF}]}{3 + [\\text{BDNF}]} \\right)\n$$\nWe need to find the concentration $[\\text{BDNF}]^{*}$ that results in a target survival probability $S^{*} = 0.65$.
