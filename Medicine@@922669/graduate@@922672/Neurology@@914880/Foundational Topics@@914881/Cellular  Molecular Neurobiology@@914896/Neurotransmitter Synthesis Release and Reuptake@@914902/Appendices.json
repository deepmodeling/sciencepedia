The instantaneous vesicular release probability, denoted by $p$, scales as a power law of the local intracellular calcium concentration, $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$. This relationship is given as:\n    $$p \\propto [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^{n}$$\n    where $n$ is the cooperativity coefficient.

The value for the cooperativity coefficient is provided as $n=4$.\n\nWe can combine the first two principles to establish a direct relationship between the release probability $p$ and the calcium influx $I_{Ca}$. By substituting the expression for $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$ from the second principle into the equation for $p$ from the first principle, we obtain:\n$$p = k_1 (k_2 I_{Ca})^{n} = k_1 k_2^{n} I_{Ca}^{n}$$\nThe product of the constants, $k_1 k_2^{n}$, is itself a constant for a given synapse.

We can proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe model assumes that there are $N$ independent, release-ready vesicles. The release of each vesicle is treated as an independent Bernoulli trial. Let $X_i$ be a random variable representing the outcome of the trial for the $i$-th vesicle, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$.

The number of ways to choose $k$ successes from $N$ trials is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N}{k}$. The probability of any specific sequence of $k$ successes and $N-k$ failures is $p^k (1-p)^{N-k}$, due to the independence of the trials.
