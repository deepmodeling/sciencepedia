A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe first task is to derive how the peak calcium concentration $[Ca^{2+}]$ scales with the radial distance $r$ from the channel. We are told the calcium signal is \"quasi-steady\", which implies that the time derivative of the concentration is zero, $\\frac{\\partial [Ca^{2+}]}{\\partial t} = 0$. The diffusion process is governed by the diffusion equation. For a steady-state condition, this simplifies to Laplace's equation:\n$$ D \\nabla^2 [Ca^{2+}] = 0 $$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $\\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator.\n\nThe problem specifies spherical symmetry in three dimensions. In spherical coordinates, the Laplacian of a function that depends only on the radius $r$ is:\n$$ \\nabla^2 = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{d}{dr} \\right) $$\nLetting $C(r)$ represent the calcium concentration $[Ca^{2+}](r)$, the equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) = 0 $$\nMultiplying by $r^2$ and integrating with respect to $r$ gives:\n$$ r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} = k_1 $$\nwhere $k_1$ is a constant of integration. This constant is related to the flux of calcium ions from the open channel (the point source). Rearranging and integrating a second time:\n$$ \\int dC = \\int \\frac{k_1}{r^2} dr $$\n$$ C(r) = -\\frac{k_1}{r} + k_2 $$\nwhere $k_2$ is the second integration constant. We set the boundary condition that far from the source, the calcium concentration approaches the background level, $C(r) \\to C_{bg}$ as $r \\to \\infty$. In terms of the concentration increase above baseline, $\\Delta C(r) = C(r) - C_{bg}$, this means $\\Delta C(r) \\to 0$ as $r \\to \\infty$. For the equation $\\Delta C(r) = -k_1/r + (k_2 - C_{bg})$, this implies the constant $(k_2 - C_{bg})$ must be zero. Thus, the concentration increase above baseline is inversely proportional to the distance from the source.\n$$ [Ca^{2+}](r) \\propto \\frac{1}{r} $$\nThis shows that the peak calcium concentration at the sensor scales inversely with its distance $r$ from the channel.\n\nNext, we express the fractional change in peak calcium at the sensor due to RIM removal. Let $[Ca^{2+}]_{0}$ be the concentration at the baseline distance $r_0$ and $[Ca^{2+}]_{1}$ be the concentration at the new distance $r_1$. Using the scaling relation $[Ca^{2+}](r) = \\frac{K}{r}$ for some proportionality constant $K$, we have:\n$$ [Ca^{2+}]_{0} = \\frac{K}{r_0} $$\n$$ [Ca^{2+}]_{1} = \\frac{K}{r_1} $$\nThe fractional change is the ratio of the new concentration to the original concentration:\n$$ \\frac{[Ca^{2+}]_{1}}{[Ca^{2+}]_{0}} = \\frac{K/r_1}{K/r_0} = \\frac{r_0}{r_1} $$\n\nNow, we relate the release probability $p$ to the local calcium concentration. The problem states that fusion requires cooperative binding with four binding sites, consistent with a Hill-type dependence. The release probability $p$ is described by the Hill equation with a Hill coefficient $n=4$:\n$$ p \\propto \\frac{[Ca^{2+}]^n}{K_{d}^n + [Ca^{2+}]^n} $$\nwhere $K_d$ is the apparent dissociation constant. A standard approximation in nanodomain signaling models, especially when emphasizing cooperativity, is to consider the low-concentration regime where $[Ca^{2+}] \\ll K_d$. In this limit, the denominator $K_{d}^n + [Ca^{2+}]^n \\approx K_{d}^n$, which is a constant. The release probability then becomes directly proportional to the calcium concentration raised to the power of the Hill coefficient:\n$$ p \\propto [Ca^{2+}]^n $$\nWith $n=4$, we have:\n$$ p \\propto [Ca^{2+}]^4 $$\nLet $p_0$ be the release probability at distance $r_0$ and $p_1$ be the probability at $r_1$.\n$$ p_0 = \\beta [Ca^{2+}]_{0}^4 $$\n$$ p_1 = \\beta [Ca^{2+}]_{1}^4 $$\nwhere $\\beta$ is a proportionality constant. The fractional change in release probability is:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_0} = \\frac{\\beta [Ca^{2+}]_{1}^4}{\\beta [Ca^{2+}]_{0}^4} = \\left( \\frac{[Ca^{2+}]_{1}}{[Ca^{2+}]_{0}} \\right)^4 $$\nSubstituting our previous result for the concentration ratio:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_0} = \\left( \\frac{r_0}{r_1} \\right)^4 $$\nThis provides the symbolic expression for the fractional change in release probability.\n\nFinally, we evaluate these fractions numerically.\nThe given values are:\n$r_{0} = 30\\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n$r_{1} = r_{0} + 20\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 30\\ \\mathrm{nm} + 20\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 50\\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n\nThe fractional change in peak calcium concentration is:\n$$ \\frac{[Ca^{2+}]_{1}}{[Ca^{2+}]_{0}} = \\frac{r_0}{r_1} = \\frac{30\\ \\mathrm{nm}}{50\\ \\mathrm{nm}} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6 $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.6000$.\n\nThe fractional change in release probability is:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_0} = \\left( \\frac{r_0}{r_1} \\right)^4 = \\left( \\frac{30}{50} \\right)^4 = \\left( \\frac{3}{5} \\right)^4 = (0.6)^4 = 0.1296 $$\nThis value is already at four significant figures.\n\nThe two dimensionless quantities are the fractional change in calcium concentration, $0.6000$, and the fractional change in release probability, $0.1296$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.6000  0.1296 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4529125"}, {"introduction": "The history of recent activity profoundly shapes a synapse's response to subsequent action potentials, a phenomenon known as short-term plasticity.

All derivations are from first principles based on the provided model.\n\n**Part 1: Expected Fractional Depression**\n\nBefore the first pulse at $t=0$, the readily releasable pool (RRP) is at its full capacity. The number of vesicles is $N(0^-) = N_{\\max}$.\n\nThe release process is stochastic. Each of the $N_{\\max}$ vesicles has an independent probability $p$ of being released upon arrival of the action potential. The number of vesicles released, let us denote it by the random variable $N_{\\mathrm{rel}}$, therefore follows a binomial distribution:\n$$ N_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\sim B(N_{\\max}, p) $$\nThe probability of releasing exactly $k$ vesicles is given by $P(N_{\\mathrm{rel}}=k) = \\binom{N_{\\max}}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N_{\\max}-k}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the *expected* fractional depression. First, we find the expected number of released vesicles, $E[N_{\\mathrm{rel}}]$. For a binomial distribution $B(n,p)$, the expectation is $np$.\n$$ E[N_{\\mathrm{rel}}] = N_{\\max} p $$\nThe fractional depression is defined as the number of released vesicles divided by the initial number of vesicles in the RRP. The expected fractional depression, $D_f$, is this expectation divided by the initial capacity $N_{\\max}$.\n$$ D_f = \\frac{E[N_{\\mathrm{rel}}]}{N(0^-)} = \\frac{N_{\\max} p}{N_{\\max}} = p $$\nUsing the given value for the per-vesicle release probability, $p=0.4$:\n$$ D_f = 0.4 $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the expected fractional depression is $0.4000$.\n\n**Part 2: Expected Number of Vesicles at $t = 50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$**\n\nImmediately after the first pulse at $t=0^+$, the RRP is depleted by the number of released vesicles. The number of vesicles remaining is $N(0^+) = N_{\\max} - N_{\\mathrm{rel}}$. Since $N_{\\mathrm{rel}}$ is a random variable, so is $N(0^+)$. The expected number of vesicles remaining is:\n$$ E[N(0^+)] = E[N_{\\max} - N_{\\mathrm{rel}}] = E[N_{\\max}] - E[N_{\\mathrm{rel}}] = N_{\\max} - N_{\\max} p = N_{\\max}(1-p) $$\nThe refilling of the RRP begins from this depleted state. The problem states that refilling is a first-order process, where the rate of refilling is proportional to the number of available (empty) docking sites. Let $N(t)$ be the number of vesicles in the RRP at time $t > 0$. The number of empty sites is $N_{\\max} - N(t)$.\n\nThe rate of change of $N(t)$ is described by the following differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{refill}} (N_{\\max} - N(t)) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separation of variables.\n$$ \\frac{dN}{N_{\\max} - N} = k_{\\mathrm{refill}} dt $$\nIntegrating both sides:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{N_{\\max} - N} dN = \\int k_{\\mathrm{refill}} dt $$\n$$ -\\ln|N_{\\max} - N| = k_{\\mathrm{refill}} t + C $$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.\n$$ N_{\\max} - N(t) = \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{refill}} t - C) = A \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{refill}} t) $$\nwhere $A = \\exp(-C)$. Rearranging for $N(t)$:\n$$ N(t) = N_{\\max} - A \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{refill}} t) $$\nTo find the constant $A$, we use the initial condition at $t=0$. We are interested in the expected number of vesicles, so we use the expected value $E[N(0^+)]$ as the initial condition for the recovery process. Let the expected number of vesicles at time $t$ be $E[N(t)]$.\nAt $t=0$, we have $E[N(0^+)] = N_{\\max}(1-p)$.\n$$ E[N(0^+)] = N_{\\max} - A \\exp(0) $$\n$$ N_{\\max}(1-p) = N_{\\max} - A $$\n$$ A = N_{\\max} - N_{\\max}(1-p) = N_{\\max} p $$\nSubstituting $A$ back into the solution for the expected number of vesicles:\n$$ E[N(t)] = N_{\\max} - (N_{\\max} p) \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{refill}} t) $$\n$$ E[N(t)] = N_{\\max} (1 - p \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{refill}} t)) $$\nWe need to calculate this value at $t = 50\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe given parameters are $N_{\\max}=10$, $p=0.4$, and $k_{\\mathrm{refill}}=3\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$ E[N(0.05)] = 10 \\left(1 - 0.4 \\exp(-3 \\times 0.05)\\right) $$\n$$ E[N(0.05)] = 10 \\left(1 - 0.4 \\exp(-0.15)\\right) $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\exp(-0.15) \\approx 0.860707976 $$\n$$ E[N(0.05)] \\approx 10 \\left(1 - 0.4 \\times 0.860707976\\right) $$\n$$ E[N(0.05)] \\approx 10 \\left(1 - 0.34428319\\right) $$\n$$ E[N(0.05)] \\approx 10 \\left(0.65571681\\right) $$\n$$ E[N(0.05)] \\approx 6.5571681 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the expected number of vesicles is $6.557$.\n\nThe two results are the expected fractional depression, $0.4000$, and the expected number of vesicles at $t=50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $6.557$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.4000  6.557 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4529051"}]}
