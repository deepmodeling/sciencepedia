Therefore, the EPSC amplitude is directly proportional to the number of released vesicles:\n$$ A = k \\cdot q $$\n\nWe can now find the mean and variance of the EPSC amplitude, $A$.\nThe mean amplitude, which we denote as $m_A$, is:\n$$ m_A = \\mathbb{E}[A] = \\mathbb{E}[kq] = q \\mathbb{E}[k] = Npq $$\nThe variance of the amplitude, $\\sigma_A^2$, is:\n$$ \\sigma_A^2 = \\mathrm{Var}(A) = \\mathrm{Var}(kq) = q^2 \\mathrm{Var}(k) = q^2 Np(1-p) $$\nThe standard deviation of the amplitude, $\\sigma_A$, is the square root of the variance:\n$$ \\sigma_A = \\sqrt{q^2 Np(1-p)} = q \\sqrt{Np(1-p)} $$\n\nThe coefficient of variation, $\\mathrm{CV}$, is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean:\n$$ \\mathrm{CV} = \\frac{\\sigma_A}{m_A} $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $\\sigma_A$ and $m_A$:\n$$ \\mathrm{CV} = \\frac{q \\sqrt{Np(1-p)}}{Npq} = \\frac{\\sqrt{Np(1-p)}}{Np} $$\nThis expression can be simplified:\n$$ \\mathrm{CV} = \\sqrt{\\frac{Np(1-p)}{(Np)^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-p}{Np}} $$\nThis equation describes the dependence of the coefficient of variation on the binomial parameters $N$ and $p$. Notably, $\\mathrm{CV}$ is independent of the quantal amplitude $q$ under this purely binomial model.\n\nSquaring this expression gives a common form used in analysis:\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}^2 = \\frac{1-p}{Np} $$\n\n### Calculation of CV and the Ratio R\n\nUsing the provided sample statistics, we compute the coefficients of variation for the baseline and post-drug conditions.\nFor the baseline condition (subscript $0$):\n$m_{0} = 25\\,\\mathrm{pA}$\n$\\sigma_{0} = 10\\,\\mathrm{pA}$\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}_{0} = \\frac{\\sigma_{0}}{m_{0}} = \\frac{10}{25} = 0.4 $$\n\nFor the post-drug condition (subscript $1$):\n$m_{1} = 35\\,\\mathrm{pA}$\n$\\sigma_{1} = 14\\,\\mathrm{pA}$\n$$ \\mathrm{CV}_{1} = \\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{m_{1}} = \\frac{14}{35} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4 $$\n\nThe diagnostic ratio $R$ is the ratio of the post-drug CV to the baseline CV:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\mathrm{CV}_{1}}{\\mathrm{CV}_{0}} = \\frac{0.4}{0.4} = 1 $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ R = 1.000 $$\n\n### Interpretation of the Pharmacological Effect (CV–Mean Analysis)\n\nThe problem is to determine whether the pharmacological agent predominantly changed the presynaptic release probability, $p$, or the postsynaptic quantal amplitude, $q$. The number of release sites, $N$, is a structural property of the synapse and is assumed to be constant during this acute experiment.\n\nWe analyze two mutually exclusive hypotheses:\n1.  **The change is postsynaptic (change in $q$ only).**\n    If the drug alters $q$ to a new value $q'$ while $N$ and $p$ remain constant, the new mean $m'$ and new $\\mathrm{CV}'$ would be:\n    $$ m' = Npq' $$\n    $$ \\mathrm{CV}' = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-p}{Np}} = \\mathrm{CV} $$\n    In this case, the mean amplitude changes in direct proportion to $q$, but the $\\mathrm{CV}$ remains unchanged because it is independent of $q$.\n\n2.  **The change is presynaptic (change in $p$ only).**\n    If the drug alters $p$ to a new value $p'$ while $N$ and $q$ remain constant, the new mean $m'$ and new $\\mathrm{CV}'$ would be:\n    $$ m' = Np'q $$\n    $$ \\mathrm{CV}' = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-p'}{Np'}} $$\n    In this case, both the mean and the $\\mathrm{CV}$ change. Specifically, if the mean increases (i.e., $m' > m$), it implies $p' > p$. The function $f(p) = \\frac{1-p}{p} = \\frac{1}{p}-1$ is a strictly decreasing function of $p$ for $p \\in (0, 1]$. Since $\\mathrm{CV} = \\sqrt{f(p)/N}$, an increase in $p$ must cause a decrease in $\\mathrm{CV}$.\n\n**Comparing the hypotheses with the experimental data:**\n-   The mean EPSC amplitude increased from $m_{0}=25\\,\\mathrm{pA}$ to $m_{1}=35\\,\\mathrm{pA}$.\n-   The coefficient of variation remained constant: $\\mathrm{CV}_{0} = 0.4$ and $\\mathrm{CV}_{1} = 0.4$.\n\nThe observed data (increase in mean, constant CV) are perfectly consistent with Hypothesis 1 and inconsistent with Hypothesis 2. A change in release probability would have altered the CV, but no such change was observed. Therefore, we can infer that the pharmacological agent's primary effect was to increase the postsynaptic quantal amplitude, $q$. This could be due to mechanisms such as increasing the number of AMPA receptors at the synapse, enhancing their single-channel conductance, or increasing their open probability. The presynaptic release machinery, characterized by $N$ and $p$, appears to be unaffected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.000}$$", "id": "4528829"}]}
