According to this principle, the total rate of fluid inflow must equal the total rate of fluid outflow. The total inflow is the sum of the intrinsic CSF formation rate, denoted as $Q_{f}$, and the external infusion rate, $I$. The outflow rate, $Q_{\\text{out}}$, is described by the provided linear model, which states that outflow is proportional to the pressure gradient between the intracranial pressure (ICP), $P$, and the sagittal sinus venous pressure, $P_{v}$. The constant of proportionality is the inverse of the outflow resistance, $R_{\\text{out}}$.\n\nThe governing equation for the system at any steady state is therefore:\n$$Q_{f} + I = Q_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{P - P_{v}}{R_{\\text{out}}}$$\nThe problem describes two distinct steady-state conditions. We analyze each condition using this governing equation.\n\nFirst, consider the baseline steady state before the infusion begins.

The equation for this state is:\n$$Q_{f} = \\frac{P_{b} - P_{v}}{R_{\\text{out}}} \\quad (1)$$\n\nSecond, consider the new steady state achieved during the constant-rate infusion.

Our objective is to determine the outflow resistance, $R_{\\text{out}}$. We have a system of two equations, $(1)$ and $(2)$, with the unknowns being $Q_{f}$, $P_{v}$, and $R_{\\text{out}}$. To find $R_{\\text{out}}$, we can eliminate the other unknowns by subtracting Equation $(1)$ from Equation $(2)$:\n$$(Q_{f} + I) - Q_{f} = \\left(\\frac{P_{p} - P_{v}}{R_{\\text{out}}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{P_{b} - P_{v}}{R_{\\text{out}}}\\right)$$\nSimplifying the left-hand side gives $I$.

We can now rearrange this expression to solve for $R_{\\text{out}}$:\n$$R_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{P_{p} - P_{b}}{I}$$\nThis is the required symbolic expression for the outflow resistance.\n\nNext, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression to compute the value of $R_{\\text{out}}$.
