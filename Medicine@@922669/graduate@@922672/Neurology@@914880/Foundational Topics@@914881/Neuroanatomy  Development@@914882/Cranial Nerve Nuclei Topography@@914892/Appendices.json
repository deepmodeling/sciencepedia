The gag reflex is intact, palatal elevation is symmetric, and there is no dysphonia. Brain imaging shows an infarct confined to the paramedian medulla on the right, supplied by perforators of the Anterior Spinal Artery (ASA). Using the fundamental organization of the brainstem derived from embryologic development of the neural tube—specifically the medial-lateral arrangement of motor and sensory columns relative to the sulcus limitans—and the vascular territories of the medulla, select the option that best explains why the infarct spares the nucleus ambiguus (branchial motor for CN IX and X) but affects the hypoglossal nucleus (somatic motor for CN XII) and the pyramidal tract (corticospinal tract).\n\nA. The basal plate-derived somatic motor column lies medial; the hypoglossal nucleus therefore occupies a near-midline position in the medial medulla, and the corticospinal (pyramidal) tract courses ventral and paramedian. The branchial motor nucleus ambiguus, although motor in function, is laterally positioned in the medullary tegmentum because branchial motor nuclei are displaced laterally relative to the sulcus limitans.

Each clinical sign corresponds to a specific neuroanatomical structure:\n    *   Contralateral limb weakness is due to a lesion of the corticospinal (pyramidal) tract.\n    *   Contralateral loss of vibration and position sense is due to a lesion of the medial lemniscus.\n    *   Ipsilateral tongue deviation with fasciculations is due to a lesion of the hypoglossal nucleus or its intra-axial fibers (a lower motor neuron lesion).\n    *   The sparing of functions mediated by cranial nerves IX and X (gag reflex, palatal elevation, phonation) points to the integrity of the nucleus ambiguus.\n    The problem's request to explain this specific pattern of involvement and sparing based on embryological organization and vascular territories is a standard and fundamental exercise in neuroanatomy. The premises are scientifically sound and factually correct.\n\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear clinical scenario and asks for a specific explanation based on established anatomical and physiological principles. The provided information is sufficient and self-consistent, leading to a unique and verifiable neuroanatomical explanation.\n\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective clinical and anatomical terms. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is **VALID**. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe problem requires an explanation for the specific pattern of neurological deficits in a right paramedian medullary infarct based on neuroanatomy, embryology, and vascular supply.\n\n1.  **Embryological Organization of the Brainstem**: The neural tube is organized around the sulcus limitans, which separates the dorsal, sensory alar plate from the ventral, motor basal plate. In the mature brainstem, this organization persists as a series of medial-to-lateral functional columns. For the motor nuclei derived from the basal plate, the arrangement from medial to lateral is:\n    *   **General Somatic Efferent (GSE)**: Most medial column. Innervates skeletal muscles derived from somites. This column includes the hypoglossal nucleus (CN XII).\n    *   **Special Visceral Efferent (SVE) / Branchial Motor**: Located lateral to the GSE column. Innervates muscles derived from the pharyngeal (branchial) arches. This column includes the nucleus ambiguus (CN IX, X, and the cranial part of XI).\n    *   **General Visceral Efferent (GVE)**: Most lateral motor column (parasympathetic nuclei).\n\n2.  **Cross-Sectional Anatomy of the Medulla**:\n    *   **Medial/Paramedian Structures**: The most medial structures of the medulla include:\n        *   The **pyramidal (corticospinal) tract**, located ventrally and paramedially.\n        *   The **medial lemniscus**, located just dorsal to the pyramid, carrying contralateral vibration and proprioceptive information.\n        *   The **hypoglossal nucleus** (GSE), located dorsally and medially, near the floor of the fourth ventricle.\n    *   **Lateral Structures**: The lateral part of the medullary tegmentum contains:\n        *   The **nucleus ambiguus** (SVE), situated ventrolateral to the main sensory and other motor nuclei.\n        *   The spinothalamic tract, vestibular nuclei, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and inferior cerebellar peduncle are also located laterally.\n\n3.  **Vascular Territories of the Medulla**:\n    *   **Anterior Spinal Artery (ASA)**: The ASA gives off small perforating branches that supply the medial or paramedian portion of the medulla. An infarct in this territory will damage the pyramids, medial lemniscus, and hypoglossal nucleus.\n    *   **Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA)**: This artery (or sometimes direct branches of the vertebral artery) supplies the lateral portion of the medulla. An infarct in this territory damages the nucleus ambiguus, spinothalamic tract, etc., causing Lateral Medullary (Wallenberg) Syndrome.\n\n4.  **Synthesis and Application to the Case**:\n    *   An infarct in the territory of the right paramedian perforators of the ASA explains the patient's symptoms perfectly.\n    *   **Involvement of Medial Structures**:\n        *   Damage to the right **pyramidal tract** (containing fibers from the left motor cortex) causes contralateral (left) limb weakness.\n        *   Damage to the right **medial lemniscus** (containing fibers from the left side of the body that have already crossed) causes contralateral (left) loss of vibration and position sense.\n        *   Damage to the right **hypoglossal nucleus** (a lower motor neuron) causes paralysis of the right side of the tongue. Upon protrusion, the intact left genioglossus muscle pushes the tongue towards the weak right side, resulting in ipsilateral (right) tongue deviation. Fasciculations confirm the lower motor neuron nature of the injury.\n    *   **Sparing of Lateral Structures**:\n        *   The **nucleus ambiguus** is located in the lateral medulla, which is supplied by the PICA, not the ASA. Therefore, a paramedian ASA infarct spares this nucleus. This explains why the gag reflex, palatal elevation, and phonation (functions of cranial nerves IX and X) are all intact.\n\nThis analysis confirms that the specific medial-to-lateral organization of structures, rooted in embryological development, combined with the distinct vascular territories of the medulla, provides the complete explanation for the observed clinical syndrome.\n\n### OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **A. The basal plate-derived somatic motor column lies medial; the hypoglossal nucleus therefore occupies a near-midline position in the medial medulla, and the corticospinal (pyramidal) tract courses ventral and paramedian. The branchial motor nucleus ambiguus, although motor in function, is laterally positioned in the medullary tegmentum because branchial motor nuclei are displaced laterally relative to the sulcus limitans. The ASA perfuses medial medullary territories, whereas the Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA) perfuses the lateral medulla; thus a paramedian ASA infarct involves the hypoglossal nucleus and pyramidal tract but spares the laterally located nucleus ambiguus.**\n    *   This option correctly states the embryological principle: the somatic motor column (containing the hypoglossal nucleus) is medial, while the branchial motor column (containing the nucleus ambiguus) is more lateral. It accurately places the pyramidal tract medially. It correctly assigns the vascular territories (ASA to medial, PICA to lateral medulla). Finally, it draws the correct conclusion that an ASA infarct would produce the pattern of deficits and sparing described in the problem.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. The nucleus ambiguus is adjacent to the midline and shares the same ASA territory as the hypoglossal nucleus, but it is spared because its blood supply is redundantly bilateral; the corticospinal tract is lateral and predominantly perfused by PICA, explaining its involvement.**\n    *   This option contains multiple falsehoods. The nucleus ambiguus is lateral, not adjacent to the midline. It is in the PICA territory, not the ASA territory. The corticospinal tract is medial, not lateral, and is perfused by the ASA, not PICA.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. Nucleus ambiguus fibers cross the midline within the medullary pyramids, making them vulnerable to medial lesions, whereas the hypoglossal nucleus is spared because it receives bilateral supranuclear input, preventing clinical deficits in unilateral brainstem infarcts.**\n    *   This option is incorrect. Fibers from the nucleus ambiguus do not run in the medullary pyramids. The pyramids are composed of corticospinal fibers. The premise that the hypoglossal nucleus is spared is directly contradicted by the clinical finding of ipsilateral tongue deviation and fasciculations, which are signs of a lesion to the hypoglossal nucleus or nerve.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. The sulcus limitans places all motor nuclei lateral and all sensory nuclei medial; therefore, medial lesions predominantly affect sensory pathways (such as the medial lemniscus) and spare motor nuclei (including the hypoglossal nucleus and nucleus ambiguus).**\n    *   This statement incorrectly reverses the general rule of brainstem organization. Motor nuclei (from the basal plate) are generally medial to sensory nuclei (from the alar plate). Furthermore, it falsely claims that medial lesions spare the hypoglossal nucleus, which is contrary to the clinical presentation and known anatomy of the Medial Medullary Syndrome.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E. The dorsal column nuclei (gracile and cuneate) are anterior and medial in the medulla and lie within the ASA territory; their involvement explains the sensory deficit, while both hypoglossal nucleus and nucleus ambiguus are posterior and spared in paramedian infarcts.**\n    *   This option is incorrect. The dorsal column nuclei are located in the posterior (dorsal) medulla, not anterior (ventral). The contralateral sensory deficit in this syndrome is due to the lesion of the medial lemniscus (which is medial), not the dorsal column nuclei themselves. Finally, the claim that the hypoglossal nucleus is spared is false and contradicts the patient's symptoms.\n    *   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4473004"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the brainstem's general layout to its specific microcircuits, this problem focuses on the principle that a single nucleus can contain multiple, functionally distinct neuronal populations.

Begin from core organizational principles of brainstem ocular motor control: (i) conjugate gaze requires that the command for horizontal eye movement simultaneously activates an ipsilateral lateral rectus motoneuron pool and a contralateral medial rectus motoneuron pool; (ii) the abducens nucleus (cranial nerve VI nucleus) contains two distinct neuronal populations, one that forms the final common pathway for the ipsilateral lateral rectus and a second that forms internuclear neurons which ascend in the Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus (MLF) to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus (cranial nerve III nucleus); and (iii) the horizontal gaze command from the Paramedian Pontine Reticular Formation (PPRF) drives the abducens nucleus to produce conjugate movement toward the side of activation. Using these bases, define a simple state description in which the output to the ipsilateral lateral rectus motoneurons is represented by $L_{\\mathrm{LR,ipsi}}$ and the internuclear output that reaches the contralateral medial rectus motoneurons via the MLF is represented by $I_{\\mathrm{MLF\\rightarrow MR,contra}}$. A lesion that destroys the abducens nucleus sets both outputs originating in the nucleus to $0$, whereas a lesion restricted to the abducens fascicle sets only the peripherally exiting motoneuron output to $0$ while preserving the internuclear projection (i.e., $L_{\\mathrm{LR,ipsi}}=0$ but $I_{\\mathrm{MLF\\rightarrow MR,contra}}\\neq 0$). From this representation and the known spatial anatomy that the abducens nucleus lies in the dorsal pons beneath the facial colliculus and its fascicles course ventrally to exit at the pontomedullary junction, deduce the clinical pattern of horizontal gaze impairment expected for each lesion type.\n\nWhich option best captures the spatial relationship of the abducens nucleus, its motor and internuclear components, and the resulting clinical dissociation between a nuclear lesion and a fascicular lesion?\n\nA. The abducens nucleus in the dorsal pons contains motoneurons to the ipsilateral lateral rectus and internuclear neurons that ascend in the Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus (MLF) to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus (cranial nerve III). Therefore, a nuclear lesion abolishes both $L_{\\mathrm{LR,ipsi}}$ and $I_{\\mathrm{MLF\\rightarrow MR,contra}}$, causing an ipsilateral horizontal gaze palsy in both eyes (failure to abduct the ipsilateral eye and to adduct the contralateral eye when looking toward the lesion), whereas a fascicular lesion (ventrally coursing fibers of cranial nerve VI) abolishes only $L_{\\mathrm{LR,ipsi}}$, yielding isolated ipsilateral lateral rectus paresis with preserved contralateral adduction.\n\nB. Internuclear neurons that mediate conjugate gaze are located primarily within the oculomotor nucleus; thus, a nuclear lesion of the abducens affects only the ipsilateral lateral rectus, while the fascicular lesion interrupts internuclear coupling via the Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus (MLF), producing a conjugate gaze palsy toward the side of the lesion.\n\nC. The abducens nucleus contains only motoneurons for the ipsilateral lateral rectus; conjugate linkage arises from the vestibular nuclei. Consequently, a nuclear lesion produces isolated lateral rectus palsy, while a fascicular lesion produces a contralateral gaze palsy due to disruption of ascending fibers.\n\nD. Abducens internuclear neurons project ipsilaterally to the oculomotor nucleus, so a nuclear lesion produces bilateral loss of abduction, while a fascicular lesion selectively weakens the contralateral medial rectus during attempted ipsilateral gaze.\n\nE.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nLet us formalize the process of attempting to gaze to the right side.\n\n1.  **Normal Function:**\n    *   The command for rightward gaze originates from higher cortical centers, which activate the right Paramedian Pontine Reticular Formation (PPRF).\n    *   The right PPRF activates the right abducens (CN VI) nucleus.\n    *   The right abducens nucleus performs two actions simultaneously as per principle (ii):\n        1.  It sends a motor signal via its motoneurons. These axons form the right abducens nerve fascicle, which innervates the right lateral rectus muscle. This produces abduction of the right eye. In the problem's notation, $L_{\\mathrm{LR,ipsi}} \\neq 0$.\n        2.  It sends an internuclear signal via its internuclear neurons. These axons cross the midline, ascend in the left Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus (MLF), and synapse in the left oculomotor (CN III) nucleus on the motoneurons that innervate the left medial rectus muscle. This produces adduction of the left eye. In the problem's notation, $I_{\\mathrm{MLF\\rightarrow MR,contra}} \\neq 0$.\n    *   The result is a conjugate gaze to the right.\n\n2.  **Analysis of a Right Abducens Nuclear Lesion:**\n    *   A lesion destroys the right abducens nucleus.\n    *   According to the problem definition, this implies that both outputs from this nucleus are abolished: $L_{\\mathrm{LR,ipsi}} = 0$ and $I_{\\mathrm{MLF\\rightarrow MR,contra}} = 0$.\n    *   **Clinical consequence:** Upon attempted rightward gaze, the command from the right PPRF is sent, but the right abducens nucleus cannot respond.\n        *   Because $L_{\\mathrm{LR,ipsi}} = 0$, the right lateral rectus is not activated, and the right eye fails to abduct.\n        *   Because $I_{\\mathrm{MLF\\rightarrow MR,contra}} = 0$, no signal is sent to the contralateral (left) oculomotor nucleus. The left medial rectus is not activated, and the left eye fails to adduct.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The patient is unable to move either eye to the right. This is a right horizontal **gaze palsy**. The patient cannot look towards the side of the lesion.\n\n3.  **Analysis of a Right Abducens Fascicular Lesion:**\n    *   A lesion affects the fascicle of the right abducens nerve after it has exited the nucleus and is coursing ventrally through the pons. This pathway is anatomically distinct from the MLF, which is a dorsal tract.\n    *   According to the problem definition, this lesion only affects the peripherally projecting motoneuron axons: $L_{\\mathrm{LR,ipsi}} = 0$, while the internuclear pathway is spared ($I_{\\mathrm{MLF\\rightarrow MR,contra}} \\neq 0$).\n    *   **Clinical consequence:** Upon attempted rightward gaze, the command from the right PPRF is sent to the intact right abducens nucleus.\n        *   The nucleus generates the internuclear signal which successfully travels via the left MLF to the left oculomotor nucleus, causing the left medial rectus to contract. The left eye adducts normally.\n        *   The nucleus also generates the motor signal, but the axons carrying this signal are interrupted by the fascicular lesion. Because $L_{\\mathrm{LR,ipsi}} = 0$, the right lateral rectus is not activated. The right eye fails to abduct.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The patient has an isolated paralysis of the right lateral rectus muscle. The right eye cannot abduct, but the left eye can still adduct on attempted right gaze. This is an **isolated ipsilateral abducens nerve palsy**, not a gaze palsy.\n\nThe core clinical dissociation is that a **nuclear** lesion causes a **gaze palsy** (affecting both eyes for ipsilateral gaze), while a **fascicular** lesion causes an **isolated ipsilateral muscle palsy** (affecting only the ipsilateral eye, with preserved movement in the contralateral eye).\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A. The abducens nucleus in the dorsal pons contains motoneurons to the ipsilateral lateral rectus and internuclear neurons that ascend in the Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus (MLF) to the contralateral oculomotor nucleus (cranial nerve III). Therefore, a nuclear lesion abolishes both $L_{\\mathrm{LR,ipsi}}$ and $I_{\\mathrm{MLF\\rightarrow MR,contra}}$, causing an ipsilateral horizontal gaze palsy in both eyes (failure to abduct the ipsilateral eye and to adduct the contralateral eye when looking toward the lesion), whereas a fascicular lesion (ventrally coursing fibers of cranial nerve VI) abolishes only $L_{\\mathrm{LR,ipsi}}$, yielding isolated ipsilateral lateral rectus paresis with preserved contralateral adduction.**\n    This option correctly states the anatomy and function of the abducens nucleus. It accurately predicts that a nuclear lesion causes a horizontal gaze palsy by abolishing both $L_{\\mathrm{LR,ipsi}}$ and $I_{\\mathrm{MLF\\rightarrow MR,contra}}$. It also correctly predicts that a fascicular lesion causes an isolated ipsilateral lateral rectus paresis because it only affects $L_{\\mathrm{LR,ipsi}}$ while preserving $I_{\\mathrm{MLF\\rightarrow MR,contra}}$. This matches our derivation perfectly.\n    **Verdict: Correct**\n\n*   **B. Internuclear neurons that mediate conjugate gaze are located primarily within the oculomotor nucleus; thus, a nuclear lesion of the abducens affects only the ipsilateral lateral rectus, while the fascicular lesion interrupts internuclear coupling via the Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus (MLF), producing a conjugate gaze palsy toward the side of the lesion.**\n    This option is factually incorrect. Principle (ii) of the problem statement (and established neuroanatomy) places the internuclear neurons for horizontal gaze in the abducens nucleus, not the oculomotor nucleus. Furthermore, it incorrectly claims a fascicular lesion interrupts the MLF.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **C. The abducens nucleus contains only motoneurons for the ipsilateral lateral rectus; conjugate linkage arises from the vestibular nuclei. Consequently, a nuclear lesion produces isolated lateral rectus palsy, while a fascicular lesion produces a contralateral gaze palsy due to disruption of ascending fibers.**\n    This option contradicts principle (ii) of the problem statement, which explicitly states the abducens nucleus contains both motoneurons and internuclear neurons. While the vestibular nuclei contribute to gaze, the PPRF-abducens nucleus-MLF pathway is the final common circuit for voluntary horizontal gaze. The predicted clinical signs are therefore based on a false premise and are incorrect.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **D. Abducens internuclear neurons project ipsilaterally to the oculomotor nucleus, so a nuclear lesion produces bilateral loss of abduction, while a fascicular lesion selectively weakens the contralateral medial rectus during attempted ipsilateral gaze.**\n    This option is factually incorrect. Principle (ii) states that the internuclear projection is to the *contralateral* oculomotor nucleus. The predicted clinical signs (\"bilateral loss of abduction\") are nonsensical for a unilateral lesion and inconsistent with the known circuitry.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **E. The abducens fascicle runs dorsally near the Medial Longitudinal Fasciculus (MLF), such that nuclear lesions typically spare conjugate gaze due to redundancy in internuclear pathways, whereas fascicular lesions produce symmetric failure of adduction in both eyes.**\n    This option incorrectly describes the anatomy. The problem states the fascicle runs *ventrally*, whereas the MLF is a dorsal tract. The conclusion that nuclear lesions spare conjugate gaze is the direct opposite of the correct deduction. The description of the fascicular lesion's effect (\"symmetric failure of adduction\") is a sign of bilateral MLF lesions, not an abducens fascicle lesion.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4472978"}, {"introduction": "The final layer of topographic analysis involves understanding not just the location and internal composition of a nucleus, but the laterality of its projections.

The lesion size ($3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) and location (dorsal, midline tegmental) are specific.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no inconsistencies, ambiguities, or factual errors. Therefore, it is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived based on the provided information and foundational neuroanatomical knowledge.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe problem asks for the clinical syndrome resulting from a selective lesion of the Central Caudal Nucleus (CCN) of the oculomotor complex.\n\n1.  **Anatomy and Function of the CCN:** The CCN is a unique component of the oculomotor nuclear complex. It is a single, unpaired nucleus situated in the midline, at the caudal-most extent of the complex. Its lower motor neurons provide innervation to the levator palpebrae superioris (LPS) muscles. Crucially, the projection from this single nucleus is **bilateral**; it sends fibers to *both* the right and left LPS muscles.\n\n2.  **Effect of a Selective CCN Lesion:** A destructive lesion that selectively targets the CCN, as described, will damage the cell bodies of the lower motor neurons that control eyelid elevation for both eyes. According to the principles provided, a lesion of a nucleus with bilateral output will cause a bilateral deficit. Therefore, a CCN lesion will lead to bilateral weakness of the LPS muscles.\n\n3.  **Clinical Manifestation:** Weakness of the LPS muscles results in an inability to adequately raise the upper eyelids, a condition known as ptosis. Since the innervation is bilateral from this single nucleus, the ptosis will be bilateral. The initial presentation of \"eyelid drooping\" is consistent with ptosis.\n\n4.  **Consideration of Sparing:** The problem specifies a \"small ($3\\,\\mathrm{mm$)\" and \"selective\" lesion. This implies that adjacent nuclei within the oculomotor complex are spared.\n    -   **Sparing of other motor subnuclei:** The oculomotor complex contains other subnuclei that innervate the extraocular muscles: the superior rectus (innervated contralaterally), and the medial rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique (all innervated ipsilaterally). A selective CCN lesion would spare these subnuclei. Consequently, extraocular movements would remain intact. This aligns with the patient's presentation of \"no diplopia,\" as diplopia (double vision) would arise from misalignment of the eyes due to extraocular muscle weakness.\n    -   **Sparing of the Edinger-Westphal Nucleus (EWN):** The EWN, which controls parasympathetic functions like pupillary constriction and accommodation, is also a distinct part of the oculomotor complex. A selective CCN lesion would spare the EWN. Therefore, pupillary light reflexes and accommodation should be preserved.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** A selective lesion of the CCN is predicted to cause isolated bilateral ptosis, with normal extraocular movements and preserved pupillary function.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Unilateral complete ptosis with ipsilateral ophthalmoplegia, because the levator palpebrae superioris is driven by a paired, lateral subnucleus whose output is strictly ipsilateral and the same lesion would also involve adjacent oculomotor fascicles.**\nThis option is fundamentally incorrect. The anatomical premise \"the levator palpebrae superioris is driven by a paired, lateral subnucleus\" is false. The LPS is innervated by the unpaired, midline CCN. Therefore, the prediction of unilateral ptosis is incorrect. The claim of ipsilateral ophthalmoplegia would require a lesion of the other motor subnuclei or the exiting nerve fascicles, contradicting the \"selective\" nature of the lesion and the \"no diplopia\" clinical finding.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Bilateral, symmetric complete ptosis with preserved pupillary constriction and intact extraocular movements, because the Central Caudal Nucleus is an unpaired midline subnucleus that projects bilaterally to both levator palpebrae superioris muscles, while the Edinger–Westphal nucleus and other oculomotor subnuclei are anatomically distinct.**\nThis option accurately describes the predicted clinical syndrome: bilateral ptosis with sparing of other oculomotor functions. The explanation provided is entirely correct: the CCN is an unpaired midline nucleus with bilateral projections to the LPS muscles, and its anatomical distinction from the EWN and other motor subnuclei accounts for the sparing of pupillary function and eye movements in a selective lesion.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Bilateral mydriasis and loss of accommodation without eyelid drooping, because the Edinger–Westphal nucleus is a single midline nucleus that sends bilateral efferent fibers to both ciliary ganglia.**\nThis option describes the syndrome resulting from a lesion of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EWN), not the CCN. While the EWN is nearby and a lesion there would cause bilateral mydriasis (pupil dilation), the problem explicitly states the lesion involves the CCN. Furthermore, this option claims there is no eyelid drooping, which directly contradicts the consequence of a CCN lesion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Contralateral superior rectus weakness with normal eyelid elevation, because superior rectus control is mediated by a midline subnucleus that projects bilaterally, leaving the levator palpebrae superioris unaffected.**\nThis option is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, it claims normal eyelid elevation, which is false for a CCN lesion. Second, the anatomical reasoning is flawed; the superior rectus muscle is innervated by a *paired* subnucleus whose fibers decussate (cross the midline) to supply the *contralateral* muscle. Its nucleus is not midline and its projection is not bilateral.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Bilateral ptosis accompanied by impaired upgaze and convergence, because the same midline subnucleus that elevates the eyelids also mediates vertical gaze and near response through shared premotor circuits.**\nThis option correctly identifies bilateral ptosis but incorrectly attributes other functions to the CCN. The CCN innervates the LPS muscles; it does not directly mediate upgaze or convergence. These functions are controlled by distinct, albeit nearby, premotor structures (e.g., the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus for vertical gaze). While a larger lesion could affect these structures, the option incorrectly conflates them with the CCN itself. The problem specifies a *selective* CCN lesion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4473015"}]}
