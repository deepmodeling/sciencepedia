The problem provides the following data:\n- The average excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitude, which we denote as $|I_E|$, is $50\\,\\mathrm{pA}$.\n- The average inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) amplitude, which we denote as $|I_I|$, is $35\\,\\mathrm{pA}$.\n\nThe problem defines the E/I ratio as the ratio of the mean excitatory synaptic current magnitude to the mean inhibitory synaptic current magnitude. We can write this as:\n$$\n\\frac{E}{I} = \\frac{|I_E|}{|I_I|}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values into this definition:\n$$\n\\frac{E}{I} = \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{pA}}{35\\,\\mathrm{pA}}\n$$\nThe units of picoamperes ($\\mathrm{pA}$) cancel, resulting in a dimensionless quantity, as required. The calculation is:\n$$\n\\frac{E}{I} = \\frac{50}{35} = \\frac{10}{7} \\approx 1.42857...\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the answer should be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the E/I ratio is $1.43$.\n\nSecond, we proceed with the qualitative reasoning, starting from the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model. The subthreshold membrane potential, $V_m$, of a neuron in the LIF framework is described by the following differential equation:\n$$\nC_m \\frac{dV_m}{dt} = -g_L(V_m - E_L) + I_{syn}(t)\n$$\nwhere $C_m$ is the membrane capacitance, $g_L$ is the leak conductance, $E_L$ is the leak reversal potential, and $I_{syn}(t)$ is the total synaptic current. An action potential is generated when $V_m$ reaches a threshold $V_{th}$. The synaptic current $I_{syn}(t)$ is the sum of excitatory and inhibitory currents, $I_{syn}(t) = I_E(t) + I_I(t)$.\n\nAn E/I ratio of approximately $1.43$ signifies that the amplitude of excitatory currents is, on average, about $43\\%$ larger than the amplitude of inhibitory currents. In the context of the LIF model, this implies that the synaptic input provides a net depolarizing drive. An average excitatory current of $|I_E|=50\\,\\mathrm{pA}$ will tend to drive the membrane potential $V_m$ towards the excitatory reversal potential (around $0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$), while an average inhibitory current of $|I_I|=35\\,\\mathrm{pA}$ will tend to drive it towards the inhibitory reversal potential (around $-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ to $-80\\,\\mathrm{mV}$). An E/I ratio greater than $1$ suggests that the excitatory influence on the membrane potential's trajectory is stronger than the inhibitory influence.\n\nThis has direct implications for spike probability. A stronger net depolarizing drive means that the membrane potential, $V_m$, will spend more time at depolarized levels and will traverse the distance from the resting potential to the spike threshold $V_{th}$ more quickly and more frequently. Consequently, an E/I ratio of $1.43$ biases the layer $\\mathrm{III}$ pyramidal neurons towards a higher probability of firing action potentials in response to synaptic input. The system is operating in an \"excitation-dominant\" regime with respect to current amplitudes, which promotes neuronal firing.\n\nNext, we consider the impact on population synchrony within the microcolumn. The circuit is described as consisting of excitatory pyramidal cells and perisomatic inhibition from parvalbumin-positive (PV+) basket cells. This is the canonical architecture for a network capable of generating gamma-band oscillations through a mechanism known as Pyramidal-Interneuron Network Gamma (PING). This mechanism relies on a precise interplay between excitation and inhibition.\n\nThe E/I ratio of $1.43$ provides the necessary strong excitatory drive for this mechanism to operate effectively. The process is as follows:\n$1$. A volley of excitatory input causes a subset of pyramidal neurons to fire. The E/I ratio being greater than $1$ ensures this initial firing can occur robustly.\n$2$. These firing pyramidal neurons send excitatory projections to the local PV+ basket cells.\n$3$. The PV+ interneurons, which are fast-spiking, are rapidly driven to fire in response.\n$4$. The PV+ cells then deliver strong, fast, and widespread perisomatic inhibition back onto the population of pyramidal neurons. The perisomatic location of these synapses makes the inhibition highly effective at controlling the timing of pyramidal cell spikes.\n$5$. This powerful wave of inhibition transiently silences the pyramidal cells and synchronizes them by aligning their membrane potentials near the inhibitory reversal potential.\n$6$. As the fast synaptic inhibition decays (typically with a time constant of $\\sim 5-10\\,\\mathrm{ms}$), the pyramidal cells are released from inhibition nearly simultaneously. Driven by the persistent background excitation, they are now poised to fire again in a more synchronized volley.\n\nThis cycle of excitation-then-inhibition repeats, with a period determined largely by the decay time of the inhibition, leading to rhythmic, synchronized firing of the pyramidal cell population at frequencies typically in the gamma range ($20-80\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$). Therefore, an E/I ratio of $1.43$ is not only consistent with, but is expected to promote, high levels of population synchrony in a microcircuit with this specific cytoarchitecture. It establishes a dynamic balance where the network is active and responsive, but the strong, fast feedback inhibition prevents runaway excitation and instead sculpts the population activity into coherent oscillations.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.43}\n$$", "id": "4466364"}, {"introduction": "The brain does not represent the sensory world uniformly; instead, it allocates more neural resources to regions of higher sensory importance, a principle known as cortical magnification.
