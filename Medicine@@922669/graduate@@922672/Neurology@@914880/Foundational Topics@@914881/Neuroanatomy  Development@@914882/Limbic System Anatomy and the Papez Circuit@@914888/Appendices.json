We can express this as:\n$$\nT_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} T_{i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{5} D_{j}\n$$\nwhere $T_i$ is the conduction time for the $i$-th tract and $D_j$ is the delay at the $j$-th synapse.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected cumulative time, $E[T_{total}]$. By the linearity of expectation, the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations:\n$$\nE[T_{total}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{5} T_{i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{5} D_{j}\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} E[T_{i}] + \\sum_{j=1}^{5} E[D_{j}]\n$$\n\nWe will compute the expected total synaptic delay and the expected total conduction time separately.\n\n**1.

Expected Conduction Time**\n\nThe conduction time for a single tract $i$ is given by the fundamental relation $T_i = \\frac{L_i}{V_i}$, where $L_i$ is the length of the tract and $V_i$ is the conduction velocity.\nThe expected conduction time for tract $i$ is $E[T_i] = E\\left[\\frac{L_i}{V_i}\\right]$.

The ratio decreases by $20\\%$ to $R_1 = 1.25$, because layer III partially compensates for the loss in layer II drive.**\n- \"layer III partially compensates\": Incorrect. This directly contradicts the problem's explicit constraint that \"layer III parameters [are] unchanged (no immediate compensatory changes)\".\n- \"The ratio decreases by $20\\%$ to $R_1 = 1.25$\": Incorrect.

The model dictates that $I_{\\mathrm{CA3}} = p_{\\mathrm{CA3}} \\times I_{\\mathrm{II}}$. Since $I_{\\mathrm{II}}$ is halved, $I_{\\mathrm{CA3}}$ must also be halved. \"Recurrent collateral amplification\" is a real phenomenon but is not part of the model provided in the problem statement.

This value is derived from a faulty premise, although the internal calculation ($300 / (384 \\times 1.25) = 300 / 480 = 0.625$) is arithmetically sound.

The anatomical components should be abstracted as a directed cyclic graph with nodes representing regions and edges representing tracts. The core regions are hippocampus, mammillary bodies, anterior thalamic nuclei, cingulate gyrus, and entorhinal cortex. The mammillothalamic tract corresponds to the directed edge from mammillary bodies to anterior thalamic nuclei.\n\nFundamental base and definitions:\n- A directed graph is represented by an adjacency matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, where $A_{ij}$ is the weight of the directed edge from node $i$ to node $j$, with $n$ the number of nodes.\n- A nonnegative linear propagation model on a directed graph uses a discrete-time update of the form $x_{t+1} = \\alpha A^\\top x_t + u$, where $x_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the activation vector at time $t$, $A^\\top$ is the transpose of the adjacency matrix, $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a scalar propagation factor with $0 \\le \\alpha < 1/\\rho(A)$, and $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a nonnegative constant input vector. Here $\\rho(A)$ denotes the spectral radius of $A$. Under these conditions, the system converges to a unique fixed point $x^\\ast$ such that $x^\\ast = \\alpha A^\\top x^\\ast + u$.\n- The anatomical mapping to the matrix indices will be fixed as follows: hippocampus index $0$, mammillary bodies index $1$, anterior thalamic nuclei index $2$, cingulate gyrus index $3$, entorhinal cortex index $4$. The primary cycle is hippocampus $\\rightarrow$ mammillary bodies $\\rightarrow$ anterior thalamic nuclei $\\rightarrow$ cingulate gyrus $\\rightarrow$ entorhinal cortex $\\rightarrow$ hippocampus, with an additional collateral hippocampus $\\rightarrow$ anterior thalamic nuclei edge.\n\nYour tasks:\n1. For each test case, construct the adjacency matrix $A$ of size $5 \\times 5$ using the provided edge weights, with all unspecified entries set to $0$. The nonzero entries correspond to:\n   - Hippocampus $\\rightarrow$ mammillary bodies: $A_{0,1} = w_{\\mathrm{HPC}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{MB}}$.\n   - Mammillary bodies $\\rightarrow$ anterior thalamic nuclei: $A_{1,2} = w_{\\mathrm{MB}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{ATN}}$.\n   - Anterior thalamic nuclei $\\rightarrow$ cingulate gyrus: $A_{2,3} = w_{\\mathrm{ATN}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{CG}}$.\n   - Cingulate gyrus $\\rightarrow$ entorhinal cortex: $A_{3,4} = w_{\\mathrm{CG}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{EC}}$.\n   - Entorhinal cortex $\\rightarrow$ hippocampus: $A_{4,0} = w_{\\mathrm{EC}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{HPC}}$.\n   - Hippocampus $\\rightarrow$ anterior thalamic nuclei (collateral): $A_{0,2} = w_{\\mathrm{HPC}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{ATN}}$.\n2. For each test case, compute the baseline fixed point $x^\\ast_{\\mathrm{base}}$ for the update $x_{t+1} = \\alpha A^\\top x_t + u$, with $u = [s, 0, 0, 0, 0]^\\top$, where $s$ is the scalar input magnitude injected into the hippocampus. Do not use any unstated shortcut formulas; your program may find $x^\\ast_{\\mathrm{base}}$ by any correct method that obeys the fundamental base (e.g., simulating iterations until convergence).\n3. Simulate disruption of the mammillothalamic tract by removing the edge mammillary bodies $\\rightarrow$ anterior thalamic nuclei, i.e., set $A_{1,2} = 0$ and recompute the fixed point $x^\\ast_{\\mathrm{disrupt}}$ for the same $A$, $\\alpha$, and $u$.\n4.

Each entry must be the list of three decimals corresponding to the fractional deficits for anterior thalamic nuclei, cingulate gyrus, and entorhinal cortex. The line must be exactly of the form `[result_1,result_2,result_3,result_4]`, where each `result_i` is a Python-style list. For example: `[[d_1_ATN, d_1_CG, d_1_EC], [d_2_ATN, d_2_CG, d_2_EC], [d_3_ATN, d_3_CG, d_3_EC], [d_4_ATN, d_4_CG, d_4_EC]]`.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded. It presents a simplified but valid computational model of signal propagation in the Papez circuit of the limbic system. The model uses a standard discrete-time linear system on a directed graph, which is a common approach in computational neuroscience. The fixed-point equation $x_{t+1} = \\alpha A^\\top x_t + u$ converges to a unique steady-state activation vector $x^\\ast$ under the specified condition $0 \\le \\alpha < 1/\\rho(A)$, where $\\rho(A)$ is the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix $A$. This condition guarantees the invertibility of the matrix in the analytical solution. All givens, including the anatomical-to-computational mapping, parameters, and tasks, are clearly and consistently defined. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the fixed point $x^\\ast$ of the linear system. The fixed-point condition is given by the equation:\n$$x^\\ast = \\alpha A^\\top x^\\ast + u$$\nwhere $x^\\ast \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the fixed-point activation vector, $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is the adjacency matrix for $n=5$ nodes, $\\alpha$ is the propagation factor, and $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is the external input vector.\n\nThis equation can be rearranged into a standard system of linear equations:\n$$I x^\\ast - \\alpha A^\\top x^\\ast = u$$\n$$(I - \\alpha A^\\top) x^\\ast = u$$\nHere, $I$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix. The problem states that the condition $0 \\le \\alpha < 1/\\rho(A)$ holds, which ensures that the spectral radius of $\\alpha A^\\top$ is less than $1$. This guarantees that the matrix $(I - \\alpha A^\\top)$ is invertible, and thus a unique solution $x^\\ast$ exists. The solution can be found by solving this linear system for $x^\\ast$.\n$$x^\\ast = (I - \\alpha A^\\top)^{-1} u$$\nComputationally, this is most efficiently and accurately solved using a numerical linear algebra solver for systems of the form $Mx=b$, where $M = (I - \\alpha A^\\top)$ and $b = u$.\n\nThe procedure for each test case is as follows:\n\n1.  **Construct Matrices and Vectors**: For each test case tuple $(w_{\\mathrm{HPC}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{MB}}, w_{\\mathrm{MB}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{ATN}}, w_{\\mathrm{ATN}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{CG}}, w_{\\mathrm{CG}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{EC}}, w_{\\mathrm{EC}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{HPC}}, w_{\\mathrm{HPC}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{ATN}}, \\alpha, s)$, we first construct the baseline adjacency matrix $A_{\\mathrm{base}}$. The nodes are indexed as hippocampus ($0$), mammillary bodies ($1$), anterior thalamic nuclei ($2$), cingulate gyrus ($3$), and entorhinal cortex ($4$).\n    The $5 \\times 5$ matrix $A_{\\mathrm{base}}$ is populated as:\n    $$\n    A_{\\mathrm{base}} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n    0 & w_{\\mathrm{HPC}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{MB}} & w_{\\mathrm{HPC}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{ATN}} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & w_{\\mathrm{MB}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{ATN}} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 & w_{\\mathrm{ATN}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{CG}} & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & w_{\\mathrm{CG}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{EC}} \\\\\n    w_{\\mathrm{EC}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{HPC}} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n    \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    The input vector is $u = [s, 0, 0, 0, 0]^\\top$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Baseline Fixed Point ($x^\\ast_{\\mathrm{base}}$)**: We form the linear system matrix $M_{\\mathrm{base}} = (I - \\alpha A_{\\mathrm{base}}^\\top)$ and solve the equation $M_{\\mathrm{base}} x = u$ for $x$. The solution is the baseline fixed-point vector, $x^\\ast_{\\mathrm{base}}$.\n\n3.  **Simulate Disruption**: A disrupted adjacency matrix, $A_{\\mathrm{disrupt}}$, is created by taking $A_{\\mathrm{base}}$ and setting the entry for the mammillothalamic tract to zero: $(A_{\\mathrm{disrupt}})_{1,2} = 0$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Disrupted Fixed Point ($x^\\ast_{\\mathrm{disrupt}}$)**: We form a new system matrix $M_{\\mathrm{disrupt}} = (I - \\alpha A_{\\mathrm{disrupt}}^\\top)$ and solve $M_{\\mathrm{disrupt}} x = u$. The solution is the disrupted fixed-point vector, $x^\\ast_{\\mathrm{disrupt}}$.\n\n5.  **Compute Fractional Deficits**: The fractional deficits for the three downstream nodes of interest (anterior thalamic nuclei, index $2$; cingulate gyrus, index $3$; entorhinal cortex, index $4$) are calculated using the formula:\n    $$d_i = \\frac{x^\\ast_{\\mathrm{base}}[i] - x^\\ast_{\\mathrm{disrupt}}[i]}{x^\\ast_{\\mathrm{base}}[i]}$$ for $i \\in \\{2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nA key property of this model is that the connections from node $2$ to $3$ and from node $3$ to $4$ form a simple chain. The fixed-point activations are related by $x^\\ast[3] = c_{23} x^\\ast[2]$ and $x^\\ast[4] = c_{34} x^\\ast[3]$, where the constants $c_{23}$ and $c_{34}$ depend on $\\alpha$ and the respective edge weights but are identical for both the baseline and disrupted systems. Consequently, the fractional deficit will be identical for all three nodes: $d_2 = d_3 = d_4$. This is because any percentage change in the activation of node $2$ propagates as the same percentage change to nodes $3$ and $4$ in this linear chain structure.\n\nFor case $4$, the collateral path $w_{\\mathrm{HPC}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{ATN}}$ is zero, and the primary cycle is broken at $w_{\\mathrm{EC}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{HPC}}=0$. The only path for activation to reach nodes $2$, $3$, and $4$ is via the mammillothalamic tract ($0 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow \\dots$). When this tract is disrupted by setting $(A_{\\mathrm{disrupt}})_{1,2}=0$, there is no longer any path from the input at node $0$ to nodes $2$, $3$, or $4$. Therefore, their activations $x^\\ast_{\\mathrm{disrupt}}[2]$, $x^\\ast_{\\mathrm{disrupt}}[3]$, and $x^\\ast_{\\mathrm{disrupt}}[4]$ become zero, leading to a fractional deficit of $1.0$ for all three.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the impact of mammillothalamic tract disruption in a model of the Papez circuit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Each test case is a tuple of the form:\n    # (w_HPC->MB, w_MB->ATN, w_ATN->CG, w_CG->EC, w_EC->HPC, w_HPC->ATN, alpha, s)\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.9, 0.8, 0.85, 0.7, 0.6, 0.1, 0.4, 1.0),\n        (0.9, 0.05, 0.85, 0.7, 0.6, 0.2, 0.4, 1.0),\n        (0.9, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 1.0),\n        (0.9, 0.8, 0.85, 0.7, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 1.0),\n    ]\n\n    all_results = []\n    n_nodes = 5\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        w_hpc_mb, w_mb_atn, w_atn_cg, w_cg_ec, w_ec_hpc, w_hpc_atn, alpha, s = case\n\n        # 1.
