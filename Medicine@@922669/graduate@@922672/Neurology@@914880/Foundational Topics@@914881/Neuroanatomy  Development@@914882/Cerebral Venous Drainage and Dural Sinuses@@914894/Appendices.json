The tangential velocity component is zero, $v_\\theta=0$.\n3.  **Fully developed laminar flow:** The velocity profile is constant along the axial direction, so $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0$. For an incompressible fluid in a pipe of constant cross-section, the continuity equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0$ simplifies, and combined with the no-slip condition at the wall, implies the radial velocity component is also zero, $v_R=0$.\n4.  The gravitational body force $\\rho g_z$ is assumed to be negligible or incorporated into the pressure term $P$.\n\nApplying these simplifications, the momentum equation reduces significantly. All terms on the left-hand side (the convective acceleration) become zero. The second and third terms within the viscosity bracket also become zero. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{dP}{dz} + \\frac{\\mu}{R} \\frac{d}{dR} \\left( R \\frac{d v_z}{dR} \\right) $$\nHere, we use total derivatives because pressure $P$ can be shown to be a function of $z$ only, and the axial velocity $v_z$ is a function of $R$ only. Rearranging this ordinary differential equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dR} \\left( R \\frac{d v_z}{dR} \\right) = \\frac{R}{\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} $$\nIntegrating once with respect to $R$:\n$$ R \\frac{d v_z}{dR} = \\frac{R^2}{2\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} + C_1 $$\nDividing by $R$ and integrating a second time:\n$$ v_z(R) = \\frac{R^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} + C_1 \\ln(R) + C_2 $$\nTo determine the integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$, we apply the boundary conditions:\n1.  The velocity must be finite at the centerline of the pipe ($R=0$). Since $\\ln(R)$ approaches $-\\infty$ as $R \\to 0$, we must have $C_1 = 0$ to avoid a physically impossible infinite velocity.\n2.  The no-slip condition at the pipe wall ($R=r$) requires the fluid velocity to be zero: $v_z(r) = 0$.\n    $$ 0 = \\frac{r^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} + C_2 \\implies C_2 = -\\frac{r^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} $$\nSubstituting the constants back into the velocity equation yields the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$ v_z(R) = \\frac{1}{4\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} (R^2 - r^2) $$\nSince we expect pressure to decrease along the direction of flow, the pressure gradient $\\frac{dP}{dz}$ is negative.

Normal intracranial pressure (ICP) is typically below $15\\ \\text{mmHg}$. The dural venous sinuses are the main conduits for draining venous blood from the brain, and the pressure within them is a key determinant of ICP. A calculated pressure drop of $\\Delta P \\approx 0.470\\ \\text{mmHg}$ over a significant length of $30\\ \\text{cm}$ is a very small gradient.

Computed Tomography Venography (CTV) is generally inferior to MRV for detecting acute dural sinus thrombosis and should not be used as a confirmatory test when TOF MRV is equivocal.", "solution": "**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe core principle behind noncontrast Time-of-Flight (TOF) angiography is the differentiation of flowing blood from stationary tissue. This is achieved using a fast gradient-recalled echo (GRE) pulse sequence with a short repetition time ($TR$).\n\n$1$. **Saturation of Stationary Tissue:** The short $TR$ is typically much less than the longitudinal relaxation time ($T_1$) of most biological tissues. When a volume (slab) of tissue is subjected to repeated radiofrequency (RF) excitation pulses, the longitudinal magnetization ($M_z$) of stationary spins does not have sufficient time to recover to its equilibrium value, $M_0$. After a few RF pulses, $M_z$ reaches a low steady-state value, a phenomenon known as saturation. The signal from stationary tissue is therefore suppressed. The steady-state longitudinal magnetization ($M_{ss}$) is given by:\n$$ M_{ss} = M_0 \\frac{1 - e^{-TR/T_1}}{1 - \\cos(\\alpha) e^{-TR/T_1}} $$\nFor a short $TR$ and a non-zero flip angle $\\alpha$, $M_{ss}$ is significantly smaller than $M_0$.\n\n$2$. **Flow-Related Enhancement (Inflow Effect):** Blood flowing into the imaging slab consists of \"fresh\" protons that have not been subjected to the recent RF pulses. These unsaturated spins possess full longitudinal magnetization ($M_z \\approx M_0$). When they enter the slab and are excited by an RF pulse, they produce a strong signal. This high signal from incoming blood is termed flow-related enhancement or the inflow effect. For this effect to be robust, there must be a continuous supply of fresh spins into the slab. This is maximized when the flow direction is perpendicular to the imaging plane (through-plane flow).\n\n$3$. **In-Plane Flow Artifact:** The problem states the left transverse sinus runs \"predominantly parallel to the imaging plane\" (the axial slab). In this geometry, blood flowing within the sinus remains inside the excited slab for an extended distance and duration. The spins within this blood are therefore subjected to multiple successive RF pulses, similar to the surrounding stationary brain tissue. Consequently, these blood spins also become saturated, their longitudinal magnetization $M_z$ is suppressed, and they fail to produce a bright signal. This results in signal loss, or a \"flow void,\" which can artifactually mimic the appearance of a thrombosed, non-flowing vessel. The effect is exacerbated by slow flow, as this increases the number of RF pulses a given blood spin experiences before exiting the slab.\n\nWith this physical framework, we can now evaluate the provided options.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. On noncontrast TOF MRV, slow venous flow or flow predominantly parallel to the imaging slab causes spins to experience multiple excitations before leaving the slab, driving $M_z$ toward a saturated steady state and reducing inflow-related signal; this can create artifactual signal loss that mimics thrombosis.**\nThis statement provides a precise and physically correct explanation of the in-plane flow artifact. It correctly identifies the cause (slow or in-plane flow), the mechanism (repeated excitations leading to saturation of $M_z$), and the consequence (reduced inflow signal mimicking thrombosis). This directly addresses the first part of the problem's task.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Increasing the flip angle and shortening $TR$ on the same TOF acquisition mitigates slow-flow saturation and reliably restores venous signal in an in-plane oriented sinus.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As shown by the steady-state magnetization equation, increasing the flip angle ($\\alpha$) and shortening the repetition time ($TR$) are actions that *increase* saturation. These parameter changes are used in TOF sequences to more effectively suppress the signal from a stationary background. Applying them would worsen the saturation of in-plane flowing blood, not mitigate it. To reduce saturation, one would need to decrease the flip angle or increase the $TR$, though this comes with other trade-offs.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Reorienting the acquisition slab to be more perpendicular to the course of the suspected sinus and using multiple overlapping thin slabs reduces the time spins spend within any single slab, thereby decreasing in-plane saturation and better depicting true patency.**\nThis statement proposes two valid strategies to overcome the artifact.\n$1$. **Reorienting the slab:** If the slab is oriented coronally or sagittally, flow in the transverse sinus becomes predominantly perpendicular to the slab (through-plane). This maximizes the inflow of fresh, unsaturated spins and restores the vessel's signal.\n$2$. **Using multiple overlapping thin slabs (MOTSA):** This technique divides a thick slab into several thinner ones. For in-plane flow, the distance a spin travels within any single thin slab is reduced. It exits one slab and enters the next before it can become significantly saturated. This technique helps preserve signal from in-plane flow.\nBoth strategies directly address the root cause of the saturation artifact.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Contrast-enhanced MRV using a $T_1$-weighted $3$D gradient-echo during the first pass of gadolinium is less dependent on inflow effects and is an appropriate confirmatory study when TOF MRV shows suspected artifactual signal loss.**\nThis describes contrast-enhanced (CE) MRV, a primary method for resolving ambiguities on TOF studies. Gadolinium-based contrast agents dramatically shorten the $T_1$ of blood. A fast $T_1$-weighted sequence acquired during the contrast bolus will show the blood as intensely bright due to this $T_1$ shortening. The signal is dependent on the presence of contrast within the vessel lumen, not on flow dynamics (inflow). Therefore, it is immune to inflow-related artifacts. A patent sinus will enhance brightly, whereas a thrombus will appear as a non-enhancing filling defect. This is an excellent and widely used confirmatory strategy.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Phase-Contrast (PC) MRV with a very high velocity encoding ($VENC$) is preferred to detect slow venous flow because it avoids phase aliasing and maximizes sensitivity to low velocities.**\nThis statement is incorrect due to a fundamental misunderstanding of Phase-Contrast (PC) imaging. PC-MRV measures velocity by encoding it as a phase shift in the MR signal. The amount of phase shift is proportional to the velocity and inversely proportional to the velocity encoding parameter ($VENC$). The $VENC$ should be set slightly higher than the maximum expected velocity to avoid aliasing. To be sensitive to *slow* flow, one needs a large phase shift, which is achieved by using a *low* $VENC$. Using a \"very high $VENC$\" would produce a very small phase shift for slow venous flow, making it difficult or impossible to detect (low signal-to-noise). Thus, a high $VENC$ *minimizes* sensitivity to slow flow.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. Computed Tomography Venography (CTV) is generally inferior to MRV for detecting acute dural sinus thrombosis and should not be used as a confirmatory test when TOF MRV is equivocal.**\nThis statement is clinically and technically incorrect. Computed Tomography Venography (CTV), performed by acquiring a CT scan after intravenous contrast administration, is a highly accurate, fast, and robust method for diagnosing dural venous sinus thrombosis. It is less susceptible to the flow artifacts that can make noncontrast MRV equivocal. In many clinical settings, CTV is considered a first-line or co-equal modality to MRV. Stating it is \"generally inferior\" and \"should not be used\" for confirmation is false. It is an excellent and frequently used confirmatory test.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "4467248"}]}
