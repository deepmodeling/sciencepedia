A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Expected Average Somal Speed ($v_s$)**\nThe average somal speed, $v_s$, is defined as the net somal displacement per cycle, $\\Delta x_s$, multiplied by the cycle frequency, $f_n$.\n$$v_s = \\Delta x_s \\cdot f_n$$\nThe net somal displacement per cycle is a fraction $\\eta$ of the leading process extension, $\\Delta x_l$, that occurs during the protrusion phase of the cycle.\n$$\\Delta x_s = \\eta \\cdot \\Delta x_l$$\nThe leading process extends at a constant rate $v_l$ for the duration of the protrusion phase, $T_p$.\n$$\\Delta x_l = v_l \\cdot T_p$$\nSubstituting these expressions gives:\n$$v_s = \\eta \\cdot (v_l \\cdot T_p) \\cdot f_n$$\nThe duration of the protrusion phase, $T_p$, must be determined. The total period of a cycle, $T$, is the sum of the durations of its three phases: protrusion ($T_p$), translocation ($T_t$), and refractory pause ($T_r$).\n$$T = T_p + T_t + T_r$$\nThe period $T$ is also the reciprocal of the cycle frequency $f_n$.\n$$T = \\frac{1}{f_n}$$\nBy equating the expressions for $T$, we can solve for $T_p$:\n$$\\frac{1}{f_n} = T_p + T_t + T_r$$\n$$T_p = \\frac{1}{f_n} - T_t - T_r$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $T_p$ back into the equation for $v_s$:\n$$v_s = \\eta \\cdot v_l \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{f_n} - T_t - T_r\\right) \\cdot f_n$$\nDistributing the $f_n$ term yields the final analytical expression for the predicted average somal speed:\n$$v_s = \\eta \\cdot v_l \\cdot (1 - f_n(T_t + T_r))$$\n\n**Calculation**\nTo perform the calculation, all parameters must be in a consistent set of units. We will use micrometers ($\\mu m$) for length and hours ($hr$) for time.\n\nFirst, convert the given parameters:\n- $v_l = 0.48 \\frac{\\mu m}{\\text{min}} = 0.48 \\frac{\\mu m}{\\text{min}} \\times \\frac{60 \\text{ min}}{1 \\text{ hr}} = 28.8 \\frac{\\mu m}{\\text{hr}}$\n- $f_n = 3.0 \\text{ hr}^{-1}$\n- $T_t = 2.5 \\text{ min} = \\frac{2.5}{60} \\text{ hr}$\n- $T_r = 7.5 \\text{ min} = \\frac{7.5}{60} \\text{ hr}$\n- $\\eta = 0.65$ (dimensionless)\n- $v_{\\mathrm{emp}} = 9.0 \\frac{\\mu m}{\\text{hr}}$\n\nNext, calculate the term $f_n(T_t + T_r)$:\n$$T_t + T_r = \\frac{2.5}{60} \\text{ hr} + \\frac{7.5}{60} \\text{ hr} = \\frac{10}{60} \\text{ hr} = \\frac{1}{6} \\text{ hr}$$\n$$f_n(T_t + T_r) = (3.0 \\text{ hr}^{-1}) \\left(\\frac{1}{6} \\text{ hr}\\right) = 0.5$$\nAs expected, this term is dimensionless.\n\nNow, substitute the values into the derived expression for $v_s$:\n$$v_s = (0.65) \\cdot \\left(28.8 \\frac{\\mu m}{\\text{hr}}\\right) \\cdot (1 - 0.5)$$\n$$v_s = (0.65) \\cdot \\left(28.8 \\frac{\\mu m}{\\text{hr}}\\right) \\cdot (0.5)$$\n$$v_s = (0.65) \\cdot \\left(14.4 \\frac{\\mu m}{\\text{hr}}\\right)$$\n$$v_s = 9.36 \\frac{\\mu m}{\\text{hr}}$$\n\n**Computation of the Ratio R**\nThe final step is to compute the ratio $R$ of the predicted speed $v_s$ to the empirically measured speed $v_{\\mathrm{emp}}$.\n$$R = \\frac{v_s}{v_{\\mathrm{emp}}} = \\frac{9.36 \\frac{\\mu m}{\\text{hr}}}{9.0 \\frac{\\mu m}{\\text{hr}}}$$\n$$R = 1.04$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$R = 1.040$$\nThis ratio indicates a close agreement between the model's prediction and the empirical measurement, with the model predicting a speed that is $4\\%$ higher.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.040}$$", "id": "4508301"}, {"introduction": "The remarkable precision of the cortex's 'inside-out' formation is rooted in a strict developmental schedule, where neurons born at different times find their place in different layers.

Working through this problem will allow you to quantitatively connect the fundamental process of cell division to the temporal \"birthdate\" of a neuron and its ultimate laminar fate.", "problem": "A developmental neurogenesis experiment in embryonic mouse cortex uses dual thymidine-analog pulses to infer cell cycle timing in apical radial glia and to predict laminar birthdates of excitatory neurons.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of cell cycle analysis and developmental neurobiology, specifically the dual-pulse thymidine analog labeling method and the \"inside-out\" model of cortical lamination. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution. The given values are plausible for embryonic mouse neurogenesis. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem is structured in three parts. We will address each in sequence.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the double-labeling fraction and estimation of S-phase duration, $T_S$.\n\nThe core principle of dual-pulse labeling is to identify cells that remain in a specific phase of the cell cycle—in this case, the synthesis or S-phase—for the duration of the interval between two labeling pulses. A cell is labeled with 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) at time $t_1$ only if it is in S-phase. The count of such cells is $N_E$. A second label, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), is administered at time $t_2$. A cell is positive for both EdU and BrdU if and only if it was in S-phase at $t_1$ and remained in S-phase until at least $t_2$. The count of these double-positive cells is $N_{EB}$. The inter-pulse interval is $I = t_2 - t_1$.\n\nLet $T_S$ be the total duration of the S-phase. We can define a variable $s$ representing the \"age\" of a cell within S-phase, such that $s \\in [0, T_S]$. A cell with $s=0$ has just entered S-phase, and a cell with $s=T_S$ is just about to exit it. The problem states that, for a population in steady-state cycling, the age $s$ of a cell found in S-phase at a random time is uniformly distributed over the interval $[0, T_S]$.\n\nA cell that is in S-phase at time $t_1$ with an age $s$ will have an age of $s+I$ at time $t_2$. For this cell to be labeled with BrdU at $t_2$, it must still be in S-phase. This condition is met if its age at $t_2$ does not exceed the S-phase duration, i.e., $s+I \\le T_S$. Rearranging this inequality, the initial S-phase age $s$ at time $t_1$ must satisfy $0 \\le s \\le T_S - I$. This derivation is valid for $I \\le T_S$. If $I > T_S$, it is impossible for any cell to remain in S-phase for the entire interval, and $N_{EB}$ would be $0$.\n\nThe fraction $D(I)$ of EdU-positive cells that are also BrdU-positive is the probability that a cell, given it is in S-phase at $t_1$, is still in S-phase at $t_2$. Under the uniform distribution assumption, this probability is the ratio of the length of the \"successful\" initial age interval, $[0, T_S - I]$, to the length of the total possible initial age interval, $[0, T_S]$.\n$$D(I) = \\frac{\\text{length of } [0, T_S-I]}{\\text{length of } [0, T_S]} = \\frac{(T_S - I) - 0}{T_S - 0} = \\frac{T_S - I}{T_S} = 1 - \\frac{I}{T_S}$$\nExperimentally, this fraction is given by the ratio of the cell counts $N_{EB}$ to $N_E$.\n$$D(I) = \\frac{N_{EB}}{N_E}$$\nEquating the theoretical and experimental expressions gives the formula for estimating $T_S$:\n$$\\frac{N_{EB}}{N_E} = 1 - \\frac{I}{T_S}$$\nWe are given $N_E = 1200$, $N_{EB} = 720$, and $I = 2.4\\,\\mathrm{h}$. First, we compute the experimental fraction:\n$$\\frac{N_{EB}}{N_E} = \\frac{720}{1200} = \\frac{72}{120} = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6$$\nNow, we substitute this value and the known interval $I$ into our equation:\n$$0.6 = 1 - \\frac{2.4\\,\\mathrm{h}}{T_S}$$\nSolving for $T_S$:\n$$\\frac{2.4\\,\\mathrm{h}}{T_S} = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4$$\n$$T_S = \\frac{2.4\\,\\mathrm{h}}{0.4} = 6\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\nThe S-phase duration is estimated to be $T_S = 6.0\\,\\mathrm{h}$. The condition $I \\le T_S$ ($2.4\\,\\mathrm{h} \\le 6.0\\,\\mathrm{h}$) is satisfied.\n\nPart 2: Estimation of the total cell cycle duration, $T_c$.\n\nThe problem specifies using the foundational basis that for a population with growth fraction $g=1$ and stationary cell cycle kinetics, the fraction of cells in any given phase is equal to the ratio of that phase's duration to the total cell cycle duration. For S-phase, this is expressed as:\n$$f_S = \\frac{T_S}{T_c}$$\nWe are given the S-phase fraction $f_S = 0.30$, and we have just calculated $T_S = 6.0\\,\\mathrm{h}$. We can solve for the total cell cycle duration, $T_c$:\n$$T_c = \\frac{T_S}{f_S} = \\frac{6.0\\,\\mathrm{h}}{0.30} = 20\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\nThe first requested value is the total cell cycle duration, which is $T_c = 20\\,\\mathrm{h}$. Rounded to three significant figures, this is $20.0\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\nPart 3: Prediction of neuronal birthdates for layers V and IV.\n\nThe model provided states that a synchronous cohort of apical radial glia progenitors enters S-phase at a reference time $t_{\\mathrm{ref}} = \\mathrm{E}11.5$. The \"birthdate\" of a neuron is defined as the embryonic time of its final S-phase onset. The cell cycle duration $T_c$ is assumed to be constant at $20\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\nFor the layer V cohort, the final S-phase onset occurs after $n_V = 2$ complete progenitor cell cycles have passed since the reference time. The total time elapsed is:\n$$\\Delta t_V = n_V \\times T_c = 2 \\times 20\\,\\mathrm{h} = 40\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\nTo express the birthdate in embryonic days, we must convert this duration from hours to days, using the conversion $1\\,\\mathrm{day} = 24\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n$$\\Delta t_V = 40\\,\\mathrm{h} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{day}}{24\\,\\mathrm{h}} = \\frac{40}{24}\\,\\mathrm{days} = \\frac{5}{3}\\,\\mathrm{days}$$\nThe birthdate of the layer V cohort, $t_V$, is the reference time plus this elapsed duration:\n$$t_V = t_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\Delta t_V = 11.5\\,\\mathrm{days} + \\frac{5}{3}\\,\\mathrm{days} = \\frac{23}{2} + \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{69 + 10}{6} = \\frac{79}{6}\\,\\mathrm{days}$$\nAs a decimal, $t_V \\approx 13.1666...\\,\\mathrm{days}$.\n\nFor the layer IV cohort, the final S-phase onset occurs after $n_{IV} = 4$ complete progenitor cell cycles. The total time elapsed is:\n$$\\Delta t_{IV} = n_{IV} \\times T_c = 4 \\times 20\\,\\mathrm{h} = 80\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\nConverting this duration to days:\n$$\\Delta t_{IV} = 80\\,\\mathrm{h} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{day}}{24\\,\\mathrm{h}} = \\frac{80}{24}\\,\\mathrm{days} = \\frac{10}{3}\\,\\mathrm{days}$$\nThe birthdate of the layer IV cohort, $t_{IV}$, is:\n$$t_{IV} = t_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\Delta t_{IV} = 11.5\\,\\mathrm{days} + \\frac{10}{3}\\,\\mathrm{days} = \\frac{23}{2} + \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{69 + 20}{6} = \\frac{89}{6}\\,\\mathrm{days}$$\nAs a decimal, $t_{IV} \\approx 14.8333...\\,\\mathrm{days}$.\n\nFinally, we round the three requested outputs ($T_c$, $t_V$, $t_{IV}$) to three significant figures as required.\n- $T_c = 20\\,\\mathrm{h}$ becomes $20.0\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n- $t_V \\approx 13.1666...$ becomes $13.2$ (embryonic days).\n- $t_{IV} \\approx 14.8333...$ becomes $14.8$ (embryonic days).\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix in the specified order.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n20.0 & 13.2 & 14.8\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4508367"}, {"introduction": "After a neuron migrates to its destination, it must receive a signal to stop, a crucial step in defining the boundaries between cortical layers.

It is not trivial, as it requires careful comparison of a complete loss-of-function phenotype (RELN-null, DAB1-null) with a partial/specific phenotype (Crk/CrkL mutant).\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the instructions, such as scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, or being ill-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n## SOLUTION\n\nThis problem requires an analysis of a genetic pathway based on comparing the phenotypes resulting from the removal of different components. The logic is based on the principles of genetic epistasis.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation**\n\n1.  **Establish the Baseline Pathway:** The foundational facts provide a proposed linear pathway: Reelin signal (extracellular) $\\rightarrow$ Receptors (ApoER2/VLDLR) $\\rightarrow$ DAB1 phosphorylation (cytoplasmic) $\\rightarrow$ Recruitment of Crk/CrkL $\\rightarrow$ Cytoskeletal modulation. This cascade controls neuronal migration to achieve the correct inside-out lamination.\n\n2.  **Analyze the \"Total Loss\" Phenotypes:**\n    *   In the wild type, lamination is normal: early-born (E12.5) neurons are deep, late-born (E16.5) are superficial.\n    *   In both RELN-null and DAB1-null mutants, the entire process fails. The cortical plate is inverted and disorganized. This is a catastrophic failure affecting both early-born and late-born neurons. The fact that the `DAB1-null` phenotype perfectly recapitulates the `RELN-null` phenotype confirms that DAB1 is an obligatory and essential downstream transducer for *all* aspects of Reelin-mediated lamination described.\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Partial Loss\" Phenotype:**\n    *   The conditional Crk/CrkL double mutant (`Crk/CrkL dKO`) exhibits a much more specific defect.\n    *   Deep-layer formation, involving early-born (E12.5) neurons, is \"relatively preserved\" and \"close to wild type.\" This demonstrates that the Crk/CrkL proteins are largely dispensable for the correct positioning of early-born neurons.\n    *   In stark contrast, the positioning of late-born (E16.5) neurons is severely disrupted. These neurons \"fail to complete terminal translocation and accumulate\" in incorrect positions. This shows that the Crk/CrkL proteins are essential for this specific migratory step, which is critical for late-born neurons to bypass the existing deeper layers and settle in the superficial layers.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Infer the Pathway Topology:**\n    *   The central logical step is to compare the `DAB1-null` phenotype with the `Crk/CrkL dKO` phenotype.\n    *   If the pathway were strictly linear, where DAB1's *only* function was to recruit Crk/CrkL, then the `Crk/CrkL dKO` should produce the exact same phenotype as the `DAB1-null` mutant.\n    *   The observation that the `Crk/CrkL dKO` phenotype is a subset of the `DAB1-null` phenotype (i.e., it is less severe, affecting only late-born neurons) decisively refutes a strictly linear model.\n    *   This implies that the Reelin-DAB1 pathway must **diverge** or **branch** downstream of DAB1. After DAB1 is phosphorylated, it must activate at least two distinct downstream effector pathways:\n        1.  A **Crk/CrkL-dependent pathway**, which is essential for the terminal migration of late-born neurons.\n        2.  A **Crk/CrkL-independent pathway**, which is sufficient to mediate the correct positioning of early-born neurons.\n    *   Therefore, the data strongly support a model where phosphorylated DAB1 serves as a branching point, recruiting different sets of adaptors to control different aspects of neuronal migration, with Crk/CrkL being specific to the challenges faced by late-born neurons.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. The data support a strictly linear pathway in which Crk/CrkL act downstream of DAB1 for all cortical neurons; therefore, loss of Crk/CrkL should fully phenocopy RELN-null and DAB1-null inversion across all layers.**\n    *   This statement is directly contradicted by the experimental data. The `Crk/CrkL dKO` does *not* fully phenocopy the `RELN-null` or `DAB1-null` mutants. Deep layer formation is largely normal in the `Crk/CrkL dKO`, whereas it is completely inverted in the `DAB1-null` mutant.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B. The data support that Crk/CrkL act downstream of DAB1 but selectively mediate signals required for the late phase of migration (terminal translocation) of late-born neurons, indicating a divergence downstream of DAB1 into effector-specific branches controlling distinct migratory steps.**\n    *   This conclusion is fully supported by the analysis. The positioning of `Crk/CrkL` downstream of `DAB1` is given. The observation that loss of `Crk/CrkL` only affects late-born neurons, while loss of `DAB1` affects all neurons, is the classic genetic evidence for a pathway divergence downstream of `DAB1`. The `Crk/CrkL` branch is shown to be specifically required for the terminal migration step of late-born neurons.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **C. The data imply that Crk/CrkL act upstream of Reelin to control its secretion by Cajal–Retzius cells; therefore, Crk/CrkL loss should disrupt preplate splitting identically to RELN-null.**\n    *   This contradicts the foundational facts, which place Crk/CrkL downstream of DAB1, which itself is downstream of the Reelin signal. Furthermore, if `Crk/CrkL` loss were equivalent to `RELN` loss, the phenotypes should be identical, but they are not. Finally, the conditional knockout was performed in migrating neurons, not the Cajal-Retzius cells that secrete Reelin.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. The data suggest receptor-level divergence upstream of DAB1 in which VLDLR controls late-born neurons and ApoER2 controls early-born neurons; therefore, the Crk/CrkL phenotype is explained by selective loss of VLDLR signaling rather than downstream branching.**\n    *   While receptor-level divergence is a possibility in the Reelin pathway, the given data does not directly test this hypothesis. More importantly, this option fails to explain the key experimental finding: the difference between the `DAB1-null` phenotype and the `Crk/CrkL dKO` phenotype. Since `Crk/CrkL` acts downstream of `DAB1` (which acts downstream of both receptors), the specific phenotype of the `Crk/CrkL dKO` *must* be due to events downstream of `DAB1`, not upstream. This option misattributes the cause of the `Crk/CrkL` phenotype.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4508307"}]}
