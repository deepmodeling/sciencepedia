However, **Principle 2** states that corticopontine projections are predominantly ipsilateral. Therefore, the anatomically correct projection should be `left motor cortex` $\\rightarrow$ `left pontine nuclei`. The proposed segment is **incoherent**.\n2.  **`right pontine nuclei` $\\rightarrow$ `left cerebellar cortex`:** This is a proposed contralateral projection. **Principle 3** states that pontocerebellar fibers cross the midline. This segment, as proposed, is **coherent** with the principles.\n3.  **`left cerebellar cortex` $\\rightarrow$ `right thalamus`:** This is a proposed contralateral projection. The full pathway is from the cerebellar cortex to the deep cerebellar nuclei (e.g., dentate nucleus) and then out. The projection from the `left cerebellar cortex` is to the `left dentate nucleus`. **Principle 4** states that the outflow from the dentate nucleus crosses the midline to the contralateral thalamus. Thus, the projection from the `left dentate nucleus` to the `right thalamus` is correct. This segment of the proposed loop is **coherent**.\n4.  **`right thalamus` $\\rightarrow$ `left motor cortex`:** This is a proposed contralateral projection. However, **Principle 5** states that thalamocortical projections are predominantly ipsilateral. Therefore, the anatomically correct projection should be from the `right thalamus` to the `right motor cortex`. The proposed segment is **incoherent**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 1:** The proposed loop contains two errors in laterality (the corticopontine and thalamocortical projections). Therefore, the proposed loop is **not anatomically coherent**.\n\n#### **Part 2: Clinical Effect of a Focal Lesion**\n\nWe must determine the side of limb dysfunction resulting from a lesion confined to the left cerebellar cortex. This requires tracing the pathway of influence from the cerebellum to the final motor output to the limbs.\n\n1.  **Lesion Site:** The lesion is in the `left cerebellar cortex`. The cerebellum's function is to modulate motor commands.\n2.  **Cerebellar Efferent Pathway:** Normal output from the `left cerebellar cortex` projects to the `left deep cerebellar nuclei` (e.g., dentate nucleus). From there, the pathway proceeds to the thalamus. According to **Principle 4**, this pathway crosses the midline.\n    *   `left cerebellar cortex` $\\rightarrow$ `left dentate nucleus` $\\rightarrow$ (decussation via superior cerebellar peduncle) $\\rightarrow$ `right thalamus`.\n    *   This is the **first decussation**.\n3.  **Thalamocortical Pathway:** The `right thalamus` modulates the activity of the motor cortex. According to **Principle 5**, this projection is ipsilateral.\n    *   `right thalamus` $\\rightarrow$ `right motor cortex`.\n4.  **Corticospinal Pathway:** The `right motor cortex` is the origin of the primary motor command pathway to the limbs, the corticospinal tract. According to **Principle 6**, this tract decussates.\n    *   `right motor cortex` $\\rightarrow$ (decussation in caudal medulla) $\\rightarrow$ control of the **left limbs**.\n    *   This is the **second decussation**.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 2:** The pathway of influence from the cerebellum to the limbs involves two sequential decussations. The cerebellar efferent pathway crosses, and the corticospinal tract crosses. A double crossing results in a net ipsilateral relationship. Therefore, the `left cerebellum` modulates the motor function of the **left (ipsilateral) limb**. A lesion of the `left cerebellar cortex` would primarily cause dysfunction (e.g., ataxia, dysmetria) in the ipsilateral, or `left`, limb.\n\n### **Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A.

My analysis in Part 2 shows the effect is ipsilateral.\n\n*   **B. The proposed loop is anatomically coherent; a left cerebellar cortical lesion would primarily affect the ipsilateral (left) limb.**\n    *   `\"The proposed loop is anatomically coherent\"`: This is **Incorrect**.\n    *   The entire statement is invalidated by its false premise.\n\n*   **C.

This part of the statement, while an incomplete list of errors, is not false.\n    *   `\"...a left cerebellar cortical lesion primarily affects the contralateral (right) limb\"`: This is **Incorrect**. The effect is ipsilateral.\n\n*   **D. The proposed loop is not anatomically coherent because the corticopontine and thalamocortical links are ipsilateral; after correcting the loop, a left cerebellar cortical lesion primarily affects the ipsilateral (left) limb.**\n    *   `\"The proposed loop is not anatomically coherent...\"`: This is **Correct**.\n    *   `\"...because the corticopontine and thalamocortical links are ipsilateral\"`: This `because` clause is phrased ambiguously. It states the reason for incoherence is that the links *are* ipsilateral. The most charitable and logical interpretation is that the proposed loop is incoherent *because the true anatomical links are ipsilateral*, which contradicts the contralateral links stated in the proposal. This reasoning points to the correct anatomical facts that invalidate the proposal.\n    *   `\"...a left cerebellar cortical lesion primarily affects the ipsilateral (left) limb\"`: This is **Correct**, as derived in Part 2.\n    *   This is the only option that correctly identifies both the incoherence of the loop and the ipsilateral nature of the lesion's effects.

Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) provides voxel-wise fractional anisotropy (FA), a scalar derived from the diffusion tensor eigenvalues that reflects the degree of anisotropic water diffusion along fiber bundles. For tract-level integrity, FA should be aggregated using volume weighting at the voxel level. Consider a patient who underwent DTI before and after surgery.
