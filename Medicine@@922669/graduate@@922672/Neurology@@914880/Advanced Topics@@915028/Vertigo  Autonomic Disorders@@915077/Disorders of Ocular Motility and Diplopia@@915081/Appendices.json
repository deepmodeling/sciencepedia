Prism cover testing at distance reveals right hypertropia quantified in prism diopters (PD) across conditions as follows: primary position = $4\\ \\text{PD}$ right hypertropia; right gaze = $2\\ \\text{PD}$ right hypertropia; left gaze = $9\\ \\text{PD}$ right hypertropia.

There is no limitation of ductions, and saccades are full but reveal a small corrective refixation when the right eye adducts.\n\nUsing the following fundamental bases: the primary actions of the cyclovertical extraocular muscles (superior oblique and inferior oblique), the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) that mediates ocular counter-rolling with head tilt, Hering’s law of equal innervation (yoke muscles receive equal drive), and Sherrington’s law of reciprocal innervation (agonist-antagonist pairs have reciprocal activation), apply the Parks–Bielschowsky three-step test (PB3ST) reasoning to determine the side and muscle most consistent with the observed pattern. In addition, compute the magnitude change in right hypertropia attributable to ipsilateral head tilt compared to primary position.\n\nSelect the single best option that correctly states both the localized palsy and the magnitude increase in right hypertropia with ipsilateral head tilt:\n\nA.

Right superior oblique palsy; increase of $4\\ \\text{PD}$", "solution": "We begin from the muscle action definitions and physiological laws. The superior oblique muscle has primary action of intorsion, with secondary depression and tertiary abduction; the inferior oblique muscle has primary action of extorsion, with secondary elevation and tertiary abduction. When the eye is adducted, vertical movements are predominantly mediated by the oblique muscles (superior oblique for depression, inferior oblique for elevation), whereas when the eye is abducted, vertical movements are predominantly mediated by the recti (inferior rectus for depression, superior rectus for elevation). With head tilt, the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) evokes ocular counter-rolling to maintain upright retinal orientation: head tilt to the right increases demand for right-eye intorsion (superior oblique and superior rectus) and left-eye extorsion (inferior oblique and inferior rectus). Hering’s law of equal innervation and Sherrington’s law of reciprocal innervation together shape how paired yoke muscles and antagonists respond when a single muscle is weak, manifesting as position-dependent diplopia.\n\nWe apply the Parks–Bielschowsky three-step test (PB3ST) by deducing from first principles, not by memorization.\n\nStep $1$: Identify the hypertropic eye. The measurements show right hypertropia in all conditions, so the right eye is hypertropic. A right hypertropia can be caused either by underaction of right-eye depressors (right superior oblique, right inferior rectus) or by underaction of left-eye elevators (left superior rectus, left inferior oblique). This defines the candidate set as $\\{$right superior oblique, right inferior rectus, left superior rectus, left inferior oblique$\\}$.\n\nStep $2$: Determine whether the hypertropia is worse in right or left gaze, which isolates muscles most active in those gaze positions. In left gaze, the right eye is adducted and the left eye is abducted. The data show right hypertropia increases from $4\\ \\text{PD}$ in primary to $9\\ \\text{PD}$ in left gaze, and decreases to $2\\ \\text{PD}$ in right gaze. A deviation that worsens in left gaze points to muscles that depress the adducted right eye or elevate the abducted left eye. In adduction, depression is chiefly via the right superior oblique; in abduction, elevation is chiefly via the left superior rectus. Therefore, worsening in left gaze favors either the right superior oblique or the left superior rectus from the candidate set.\n\nStep $3$: Determine whether the hypertropia is worse with head tilt to the right or to the left, using the VOR ocular counter-rolling demands. Head tilt to the right increases demand for intorsion in the right eye (superior oblique and superior rectus). If the right superior oblique is weak, the right eye cannot adequately intort on right tilt, and due to coupled cyclovertical imbalance, the right eye will appear relatively more hypertropic. The data show that with head tilt to the right, the right hypertropia increases to $12\\ \\text{PD}$, and with head tilt to the left, it decreases to $3\\ \\text{PD}$. Thus, the deviation is worse with right (ipsilateral) head tilt, implicating a weak intorter of the right eye. Candidates for right-eye intorsion are the right superior oblique and the right superior rectus. Intersecting this with step $2$’s set (right superior oblique or left superior rectus) yields the right superior oblique as the unique muscle consistent with both steps.\n\nTherefore, the PB3ST localizes to right superior oblique palsy.\n\nNext, we compute the magnitude change in right hypertropia attributable to ipsilateral head tilt relative to primary position. Ipsilateral head tilt in this case is head tilt to the right. The hypertropia in primary position is $4\\ \\text{PD}$, and with right head tilt it is $12\\ \\text{PD}$. The increase is\n$$\n12\\ \\text{PD} - 4\\ \\text{PD} \\;=\\; 8\\ \\text{PD}.\n$$\n\nWe now analyze each option:\n\nA. Right superior oblique palsy; increase of $8\\ \\text{PD}$. This matches the localization by PB3ST and the computed magnitude change ($12\\ \\text{PD} - 4\\ \\text{PD} = 8\\ \\text{PD}$). Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. Left superior oblique palsy; increase of $8\\ \\text{PD}$. A left superior oblique palsy would typically produce left hypertropia, be worse in right gaze (where the left eye is adducted), and be worse with left head tilt. Our data show right hypertropia, worse in left gaze, and worse with right head tilt, which is inconsistent with left superior oblique palsy. The magnitude change is numerically correct but paired with the wrong localization. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. Right inferior oblique palsy; increase of $8\\ \\text{PD}$. A right inferior oblique palsy would reduce the right eye’s ability to elevate in adduction, often producing a right hypotropia in adduction or a pattern where hypertropia increases in right gaze if the contralateral yoke relationships are considered. It would not produce a classic pattern of hypertropia worse in left gaze and worse on right tilt. Thus, the localization is incorrect, despite the magnitude computation being numerically $8\\ \\text{PD}$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Right superior oblique palsy; increase of $4\\ \\text{PD}$. The localization is correct, but the magnitude change from primary ($4\\ \\text{PD}$) to ipsilateral tilt ($12\\ \\text{PD}$) is $8\\ \\text{PD}$, not $4\\ \\text{PD}$.

The Parks test is predicated on the following core principles: (i) extraocular muscle primary and secondary actions (for example, the superior oblique primarily intorts and secondarily depresses in adduction; the inferior rectus primarily depresses and secondarily extorts in adduction), (ii) Sherrington’s law of reciprocal innervation and Hering’s law of equal innervation governing yoked agonist-antagonist pairs and binocular coordination, and (iii) the head-tilt–dependent modulation of ocular torsion by the otolith-driven Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR), whereby physiologic ocular counter-roll changes cyclovertical muscle load with ipsiversive head tilt.

The conditions mentioned (skew deviation, thyroid eye disease, myasthenia gravis, etc.) are real clinical entities. The limitations of the Parks test are a standard topic in clinical neurology and ophthalmology. The problem is free of pseudoscience.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear set of principles and assumptions and asks for situations that violate them, leading to a misleading result. It is structured to have a definite set of correct answers among the options based on established medical science.\n*   **Objective:** The language is precise and uses standard medical terminology. It does not contain subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the derivation and evaluation of each option.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core task is to critically evaluate the Parks three-step test in light of its foundational assumptions. The test is designed to isolate a single paretic muscle among the eight cyclovertical muscles (superior/inferior recti, superior/inferior obliques in each eye). Its logic breaks down when the underlying cause is not a single, stable paretic muscle. We must analyze each option to see if it represents such a breakdown and if the proposed confirmatory tests are appropriate.\n\n**A. An acute prenuclear otolith pathway imbalance (skew deviation) from a brainstem or cerebellar lesion mimics trochlear nerve ($\\,\\mathrm{IV}\\,$) palsy on the Parks test. A gravity-dependent otolith sign reduces the vertical deviation by $\\geq 50\\%$ when moving from upright to supine (the upright–supine test). Double Maddox rod reveals conjugate torsion, Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV) is tilted, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain confirms the lesion.**\n\n**Analysis:** This statement describes a classic central nervous system cause of vertical diplopia that can mimic a peripheral cranial nerve palsy. A skew deviation is a vertical strabismus caused by an imbalance in tonic vestibular (otolithic) inputs to the ocular motor nuclei. Since the vestibular pathways are part of the system that controls eye position, a lesion here can produce a hypertropia. The pattern of this hypertropia can be incomitant and may fulfill the three steps of the Parks test, leading to the false conclusion of a trochlear nerve ($\\,\\mathrm{IV}\\,$) palsy. This violates the implicit assumption of an intact vestibular pathway and a peripheral (muscular or nerve) locus of pathology.\n\nThe confirmatory tests listed are the standard, scientifically sound methods to differentiate a central skew deviation from a peripheral palsy:\n*   The **upright–supine test** directly assesses the influence of gravity on the otoliths. A reduction of the vertical deviation by at least $50\\%$ when the patient is supine is highly specific for a skew deviation, as the stimulus to the otoliths is fundamentally changed. A paretic deviation is largely independent of this postural change.\n*   **Double Maddox rod** testing assesses subjective torsion. A peripheral superior oblique palsy causes incyclotorsion of the affected eye. Skew deviation often causes conjugate torsion (both eyes torted in the same direction) or other atypical torsional patterns, reflecting the central vestibular imbalance.\n*   The **Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV)** is a direct measure of otolith pathway function (specifically, the utricle). A significant tilt in the SVV is a strong indicator of a central vestibular lesion.\n*   **MRI of the brain** can identify the structural lesion in the brainstem or cerebellum responsible for the skew deviation.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. This option accurately describes a known mimic of $\\,\\mathrm{IV}\\,$ nerve palsy and lists the appropriate, scientifically sound confirmatory tests.\n\n**B. Thyroid eye disease produces inferior rectus restriction with impaired elevation and extorsional imbalance. The Parks test falsely suggests a single cyclovertical paresis. Forced duction testing is positive in elevation; orbital Computed Tomography (CT) shows inferior rectus enlargement; a Lancaster red–green or Hess screen maps multi-vector restriction rather than isolated paresis.**\n\n**Analysis:** This statement describes a restrictive etiology for vertical diplopia. Thyroid eye disease (TED) causes inflammation and subsequent fibrosis of the extraocular muscles. A restricted inferior rectus muscle is unable to relax properly, physically tethering the globe and preventing it from elevating. This failure to elevate can be misinterpreted as a weakness of the elevator muscles (ipsilateral superior rectus and inferior oblique). The Parks test, which is predicated on paresis (muscle weakness), not restriction (mechanical limitation), will therefore be misleading. It violates the explicit assumption of the absence of restrictive pathology.\n\nThe confirmatory tests listed are the correct methods to diagnose a restrictive myopathy:\n*   **Forced duction testing** is the definitive clinical test to differentiate restriction from paresis. If the examiner cannot passively elevate the globe, a mechanical restriction is confirmed.\n*   **Orbital CT or MRI** will show the characteristic enlargement of the extraocular muscle bellies (sparing the tendons), with the inferior rectus being one of the most commonly affected muscles in TED.\n*   A **Lancaster red–green or Hess screen** provides a graphical map of the movements of both eyes. It will demonstrate the classic pattern of restriction: limited movement in one direction (e.g., elevation) and often a secondary over-action of the direct antagonist muscle (e.g., superior rectus) in the same eye trying to overcome the restriction. This pattern is distinctly different from the pattern of an isolated paretic muscle.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. This option accurately describes a common restrictive mimic of cyclovertical paresis and lists the correct diagnostic procedures.\n\n**C. Bilateral trochlear nerve ($\\,\\mathrm{IV}\\,$) palsy is reliably localized by the Parks test to one superior oblique muscle. Confirmation is obtained solely by the Bielschowsky head-tilt step without need for torsion measurement or fundus imaging.**\n\n**Analysis:** This statement is fundamentally incorrect. The Parks test is based on the assumption of a *single* paretic muscle. In a bilateral trochlear nerve palsy, this assumption is violated. The clinical findings are often complex and confusing. For example, the patient may have a right hypertropia in left gaze and a left hypertropia in right gaze. The Bielschowsky head-tilt portion of the test may be positive on tilting the head to either side, or it may yield an equivocal result. The test is therefore famously *unreliable* in cases of bilateral palsy and will not \"reliably localize\" the problem to a single muscle.\n\nFurthermore, the claim that confirmation is obtained \"solely by the Bielschowsky head-tilt step\" is dangerously simplistic and wrong. The most pathognomonic sign of a bilateral superior oblique palsy is a large degree of excyclotorsion, typically greater than $10$ degrees. This must be measured, either subjectively using a double Maddox rod or objectively by examining the fundus (fundus photography). Ignoring torsion measurement means missing the key diagnostic sign.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect. The Parks test is unreliable for bilateral conditions. Furthermore, relying only on the head-tilt test and ignoring torsion measurement is an inadequate and incorrect diagnostic approach for bilateral $\\,\\mathrm{IV}\\,$ nerve palsy.\n\n**D. Ocular myasthenia gravis causes fluctuating cyclovertical weakness that violates the static assumptions of the Parks test, yielding inconsistent localization. Confirmation uses an ice-pack test, Single-Fiber Electromyography (SFEMG), fatigability assessment, and acetylcholine receptor antibody testing rather than structural orbital imaging.**\n\n**Analysis:** This statement correctly identifies a condition that violates the assumption of a stable, non-variable deficit. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a disorder of the neuromuscular junction characterized by fatigable weakness. The degree of muscle weakness changes with rest and exertion. A patient's ocular alignment can vary significantly throughout the day or even during the course of a single examination. When the Parks test is performed, the results can be inconsistent and non-localizing because the \"paretic\" muscle's function is not static. A patient might appear to have a right superior rectus palsy in the morning and a left superior oblique palsy in the afternoon. This variability makes the results of the Parks test untrustworthy.\n\nThe listed confirmatory tests represent the gold standard for diagnosing ocular MG:\n*   The **ice-pack test** (improvement of ptosis or motility with cooling) is a simple, specific bedside test.\n*   **Fatigability assessment** (observing for increased weakness with sustained muscle use) is a key clinical sign.\n*   **Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody** serology is highly specific for the diagnosis of MG.\n*   **Single-Fiber Electromyography (SFEMG)** is the most sensitive electrophysiological test, detecting impaired neuromuscular transmission.\nThe statement correctly points out that structural imaging is not the primary diagnostic tool, as the pathology lies at the molecular level of the neuromuscular junction, not in the muscle's structure.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. This option correctly identifies that the fluctuating nature of myasthenia gravis invalidates the static assumptions of the Parks test and lists the appropriate confirmatory diagnostic battery.\n\n**E. Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD), a supranuclear disorder of binocular control, is correctly attributed by the Parks test to inferior oblique overaction. Confirmation uses only primary-position prism cover testing, because head-tilt and gaze modulations are unnecessary.**\n\n**Analysis:** This statement is incorrect. DVD is a complex supranuclear disorder of vergence and alignment, not a primary muscle paresis or overaction. It is characterized by a slow, upward drift of an eye when fusion is broken (e.g., by an occluder). The key feature is that *either* eye will drift upward when covered, which violates Hering's law of equal innervation to yoked muscles—a cornerstone of the Parks test. Therefore, the Parks test cannot be applied to DVD and will not \"correctly attribute\" it to anything. While inferior oblique overaction can coexist with DVD (especially in the context of congenital esotropia), they are distinct phenomena, and the Parks test is not the tool to analyze DVD.\n\nThe proposed confirmation method is also flawed. While prism cover testing in primary position is part of the evaluation, it is not the sole method, nor is it sufficient. The diagnosis relies on observing the characteristic slow, floating upward drift on occlusion, which is different from a manifest hypertropia. Furthermore, the claim that head-tilt and gaze modulations are \"unnecessary\" is false. The magnitude of DVD can indeed vary with gaze position and head tilt in some patients. A key diagnostic tool is the use of a neutral density or red filter over one eye (Bielschowsky darkening phenomenon), which can elicit the deviation without full occlusion.\n\n**Verdict:** Incorrect. The Parks test is not applicable to DVD. The description of the phenomenon and its diagnosis is oversimplified and inaccurate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "4476179"}, {"introduction": "Differentiating a paretic muscle from a mechanically restricted one is a frequent and critical challenge in diagnosing ocular motility disorders. This advanced exercise moves beyond static alignment to the analysis of eye movement dynamics. By leveraging Hering's law of equal innervation, you will learn how observing the saccadic behavior of the unaffected eye can powerfully distinguish neurogenic weakness from mechanical restriction, a key skill for refining your bedside diagnostic acumen.", "problem": "A patient aged $37$ years presents with new-onset horizontal diplopia worse in right gaze. Examination shows a rightward version deficit graded $-2$ with an abduction limitation of the right eye; pupils and eyelids are normal, and there are no upper motor neuron signs. You consider two principal mechanisms for a right eye abduction deficit: a neurogenic weakness of the right lateral rectus (innervated by Cranial Nerve VI (CN VI)) versus a mechanical restriction of the right medial rectus, as can occur in thyroid eye disease. You wish to design a bedside examination maneuver that leverages Hering’s law of equal innervation and the dynamics of saccades to discriminate the two.\n\nUse the following fundamental bases:\n\n- Hering’s law of equal innervation: for conjugate gaze, equal motor commands are sent to yoke muscle pairs (for rightward gaze, the right lateral rectus and left medial rectus).\n- Sherrington’s law of reciprocal innervation: increased activation of an agonist is accompanied by decreased activation of its antagonist.\n- Saccades are rapid eye movements driven by a premotor pulse-step command; saccadic dysmetria denotes a mismatch between saccade amplitude and target step (hypometria if undershoot, hypermetria if overshoot). Saccadic peak velocity reflects the effective contractile drive of the agonist.\n- Primary deviation is measured when the clinically better eye fixates; secondary deviation is measured when the clinically worse eye is forced to fixate.\n\nWhich option below correctly specifies an examination maneuver that operationalizes Hering’s law and saccadic dysmetria of the fellow eye to distinguish a right lateral rectus paresis from a right medial rectus restriction, and states the expected pattern that favors a right lateral rectus paresis?\n\nA. Instruct the patient to make rapid horizontal saccades between center and $20^{\\circ}$ right under two conditions: (i) left eye fixating (right eye viewing through a translucent occluder) and (ii) right eye fixating (left eye occluded). Observe the left eye’s adducting saccades and the right eye’s abducting saccades. A right lateral rectus paresis is supported if, in rightward saccades, the left eye shows minimal or modest adducting hypermetria in condition (i) but marked adducting hypermetria in condition (ii) (secondary deviation $>$ primary deviation), and the right eye’s abducting saccades are slow (reduced peak velocity) and hypometric; in contrast, a right medial rectus restriction shows similar left-eye adducting dysmetria in both conditions (secondary deviation $\\approx$ primary deviation), with a near-normal initial abducting saccadic velocity of the right eye followed by an abrupt halt.\n\nB. Perform the same two-condition saccade task as in option A, but interpret increased left-eye adducting hypermetria when the left (better) eye fixates as the signature of right lateral rectus paresis; interpret increased hypermetria only when the right (worse) eye fixates as the signature of right medial rectus restriction.\n\nC. Ask the patient to track a slowly moving target from center to $20^{\\circ}$ right (smooth pursuit) while alternately occluding each eye, and interpret any greater pursuit lag of the right eye when it is forced to fixate as the signature of right lateral rectus paresis; interpret similar pursuit performance under both fixation conditions as the signature of right medial rectus restriction.\n\nD. Instruct the patient to make rapid horizontal saccades between center and $20^{\\circ}$ left under two conditions as in option A, and interpret increased left-eye abducting overshoot when the right eye is forced to fixate as the signature of right lateral rectus paresis; interpret no change across fixation conditions as the signature of right medial rectus restriction.", "solution": "The problem asks for an examination maneuver that utilizes Hering's law of equal innervation and saccadic dynamics to differentiate between a neurogenic paresis of the right lateral rectus (RLR) muscle and a mechanical restriction of the right medial rectus (RMR) muscle, both of which can cause a right eye abduction deficit. The correct answer must also state the expected findings for an RLR paresis.\n\nLet's analyze the pathophysiology and the application of the stated principles to the two potential etiologies for the right abduction deficit. The patient presents with diplopia worse in right gaze, which requires activation of the RLR and the left medial rectus (LMR) as a yoke muscle pair.\n\n**Fundamental Principles Applied:**\n1.  **Hering's Law of Equal Innervation:** The central nervous system sends an identical motor command signal (innervation) to yoke muscles for any conjugate eye movement. For rightward gaze, the yoke pair is the RLR and the LMR.\n2.  **Saccadic Dynamics:** Saccades are initiated by a high-frequency burst of neural activity (the pulse), which determines the peak velocity. The size of the pulse is scaled to the desired saccade amplitude. A weak muscle (paresis) cannot generate normal force from a given neural pulse, resulting in a saccade with reduced peak velocity. The final eye position is maintained by a tonic level of innervation (the step).\n3.  **Primary vs. Secondary Deviation:**\n    *   **Primary Deviation:** The magnitude of strabismus measured when the non-paretic (or less affected) eye is fixating on a target. The innervation sent corresponds to the needs of this \"good\" eye.\n    *   **Secondary Deviation:** The magnitude of strabismus measured when the paretic (or more affected) eye is forced to fixate on a target.\n\n**Analysis of Right Lateral Rectus (RLR) Paresis (Neurogenic Weakness)**\n\n*   **Condition (i): Left Eye (LE) Fixating (Primary Deviation):**\n    *   The patient is asked to make a saccade from the center to a target at $20^{\\circ}$ to the right.\n    *   The brain calculates the necessary innervation based on moving the healthy LE. A \"normal\" neural command is sent to the LMR to adduct the LE by $20^{\\circ}$.\n    *   Per Hering's law, this same \"normal\" command is sent to the paretic RLR.\n    *   Because the RLR is weak, this normal command is insufficient to move the right eye (RE) fully to the target. The RE's abducting saccade will be slow (reduced peak velocity) and hypometric (it will undershoot the target).\n    *   The LE's adducting saccade, driven by a normal command acting on a healthy muscle, will be largely accurate. The resulting esotropia (inward turn of the RE) is the primary deviation.\n\n*   **Condition (ii): Right Eye (RE) Fixating (Secondary Deviation):**\n    *   The patient is now forced to fixate on the same $20^{\\circ}$ right target with the paretic RE.\n    *   To overcome the weakness of the RLR and move the RE to the target, the brain must generate a massive, supranormal neural command.\n    *   Per Hering's law, this same massive overdrive command is sent to the yoke muscle, the healthy LMR.\n    *   This excessive innervation causes the healthy LMR to contract with far too much force, causing the LE to rapidly adduct far past the $20^{\\circ}$ target. This results in a large adducting hypermetria (overshoot) of the LE.\n    *   The resulting large esotropia (now measured as the over-adduction of the LE) is the secondary deviation.\n    *   Therefore, for a paretic muscle, the secondary deviation is greater than the primary deviation. This is observed as a marked increase in the fellow eye's dysmetria when the paretic eye fixates.\n\n**Analysis of Right Medial Rectus (RMR) Restriction (Mechanical Tether)**\n\n*   **Condition (i): Left Eye (LE) Fixating:**\n    *   As before, a normal neural command is sent to the RLR and LMR for a rightward saccade.\n    *   The RLR is strong, so it begins to contract forcefully. The initial peak velocity of the RE's abducting saccade will be normal or near-normal.\n    *   However, as the eye abducts, it encounters the mechanical tether of the non-relaxing RMR, which abruptly halts or dramatically slows its movement. The saccade is cut short, resulting in hypometria.\n\n*   **Condition (ii): Right Eye (RE) Fixating:**\n    *   The patient attempts to fixate on the rightward target with the RE.\n    *   The problem is not muscle weakness but a mechanical barrier. Generating a massive overdrive of innervation to the RLR will not overcome the physical restriction. The brain (via proprioceptive or visual feedback) does not generate the same degree of excessive innervation as in paresis. The command sent to the RLR will be approximately the same magnitude as in Condition (i).\n    *   Per Hering's law, this \"normal\" command is sent to the LMR.\n    *   Consequently, the adducting saccade of the LE will be similar in amplitude and accuracy to what was observed in Condition (i).\n    *   Therefore, for a restrictive myopathy, the secondary deviation is approximately equal to the primary deviation.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A.** This option correctly describes the maneuver (saccades to the right, comparing fixation of each eye) and the expected findings. For an RLR paresis, it predicts marked adducting hypermetria of the LE when the RE fixates (secondary deviation $>$ primary deviation) and slow, hypometric saccades of the RE. For an RMR restriction, it correctly predicts similar LE dysmetria in both conditions (secondary deviation $\\approx$ primary deviation) and an RE saccade with near-normal initial velocity followed by an abrupt halt. This aligns perfectly with our physiological analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option incorrectly reverses the interpretation. It states that increased LE hypermetria with LE fixation signifies RLR paresis (this is wrong; the overdrive occurs with RE fixation). It also incorrectly states that increased hypermetria only with RE fixation signifies RMR restriction (this pattern is the hallmark of paresis, not restriction).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option proposes using smooth pursuit, not saccades. The problem statement explicitly requires a maneuver that leverages \"the dynamics of saccades\" (e.g., peak velocity, dysmetria, pulse-step commands). Smooth pursuit is a different type of eye movement controlled by different neural pathways. While deviations can be compared during pursuit, this option does not address the core requirement of using saccadic dynamics.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option proposes testing saccades to the left. The patient's deficit is in right gaze (RLR function). Testing saccades to the left engages the RMR and the left lateral rectus (LLR). In a pure RLR paresis, leftward movements should be normal. In an RMR restriction, testing the RMR as an agonist (during left gaze) is less informative for diagnosing a restriction that manifests as a failure of antagonism (during right gaze). The most definitive test involves stressing the pathological system, which means making saccades into the field of action of the paretic or restricted muscle system—that is, to the right.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4476207"}]}
