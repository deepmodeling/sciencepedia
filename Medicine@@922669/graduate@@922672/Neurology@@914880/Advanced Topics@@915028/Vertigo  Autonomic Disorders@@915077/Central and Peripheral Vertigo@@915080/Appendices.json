Therefore, I will proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the amplitude of a corrective saccade, $A_s$, that nulls the gaze position error accumulated at the end of a head impulse.\n\nGaze position, $\\theta_g(t)$, is defined as the sum of the head's angular position in space, $\\theta_h(t)$, and the eye's angular position relative to the head, $\\theta_e(t)$.\n$$ \\theta_g(t) = \\theta_h(t) + \\theta_e(t) $$\nFor perfect gaze stabilization on a stationary target, the gaze position must remain constant (ideally zero), which requires $\\theta_e(t) = -\\theta_h(t)$ at all times.\n\nThe problem describes a head impulse with a constant angular velocity $\\omega_h = 300^{\\circ}/\\mathrm{s}$ that continues until a total rotation of $\\theta_h = 30^{\\circ}$ is achieved.

Each option is a complete branching algorithm; choose the one that is most physiologically sound and operationally safe.\n\nA. Start by performing positional maneuvers (Dix–Hallpike and supine roll) on all patients with acute dizziness to classify BPPV versus non-BPPV. If positional maneuvers are negative, use HINTS. For HINTS classification, require all three central signs (normal head impulse, direction-changing nystagmus, and skew deviation) to call a central etiology; if only one or two central signs are present, classify as peripheral. Consider hearing loss only after HINTS, and if new unilateral hearing loss is present, label the case as peripheral labyrinthitis regardless of HINTS findings. Vascular risk factors influence disposition but do not change the central versus peripheral classification.\n\nB. Begin by separating temporal pattern: if the vertigo is continuous for $>\\!24$ hours with spontaneous nystagmus, proceed to HINTS; if the vertigo is brief and strictly positional, perform Dix–Hallpike and supine roll. In the acute vestibular syndrome branch, define central etiology only when two or more central HINTS signs are present. If there is new unilateral hearing loss, classify as peripheral unless National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is $\\geq 4$, in which case classify as central. Do not use severe truncal ataxia or focal neurological deficits to override a peripheral HINTS pattern. In the positional branch, a positive Dix–Hallpike test establishes posterior canal BPPV, and a negative test excludes BPPV.\n\nC. First branch by temporal pattern. If continuous acute vestibular syndrome is present (persistent symptoms $>\\!24$ hours with spontaneous nystagmus), perform HINTS before positional testing. Define central etiology when any one central HINTS sign is present: a normal (bilaterally intact) horizontal head-impulse test, direction-changing gaze-evoked nystagmus, or positive test of skew. If HINTS is peripheral (abnormal unilateral head-impulse with corrective saccade, unidirectional horizontal-torsional nystagmus following Alexander’s law, and no skew), add a simple hearing assessment; with new unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, classify as peripheral labyrinthitis if the head-impulse test is abnormal, but classify as central (anterior inferior cerebellar artery territory stroke) if the head-impulse test is normal. Independently override toward central if there are new focal neurological deficits or severe truncal ataxia (unable to sit or stand unaided), regardless of HINTS. In the triggered episodic branch, perform Dix–Hallpike and supine roll; a positive positional test with brief, fatigable vertigo and characteristic canal-specific nystagmus classifies as peripheral BPPV, while continuous spontaneous vertigo, direction-changing nystagmus, vertical nystagmus, or inability to sit upright prompts reclassification to the acute vestibular syndrome branch and central evaluation. Vascular risk factors (age $\\geq 60$ years, atrial fibrillation) increase central suspicion but do not alone overturn a peripheral HINTS without concerning neurological signs.\n\nD. Do not separate temporal patterns; apply HINTS only after a brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. Classify central when head-impulse is abnormal bilaterally or when nystagmus is unidirectional with suppression by fixation. Treat hearing loss as a benign peripheral marker unless accompanied by diplopia. Use positional maneuvers to confirm central vertigo when vertigo persists despite repeated Dix–Hallpike tests.

The task is to validate this problem statement and then, if valid, select the best algorithm from four options.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem provides the following definitions, principles, and constraints for the algorithm design:\n1.  **Patient Population:** Adult patients with acute dizziness, categorized into two groups:\n    a.   **Acute Vestibular Syndrome (AVS):** Continuous vertigo, spontaneous nystagmus, nausea/vomiting, intolerance to head motion, and gait unsteadiness lasting $> 24$ hours.\n    b.   **Triggered Episodic Positional Vertigo:** Brief vertigo provoked by positional change.\n2.  **Algorithm Components:** Head-Impulse—Nystagmus—Test of Skew (HINTS) examination, simple hearing assessment, positional maneuvers, and vascular risk factors.\n3.  **Algorithm Goals:**\n    a.   Separate central from peripheral etiologies.\n    b.   Minimize missed posterior circulation stroke.\n    c.   Avoid inappropriate testing in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).\n4.  **Fundamental Principles (Base for Design):**\n    a.   **Head-Impulse Test (HIT):** Acutely reduced unilateral peripheral vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain results in an abnormal horizontal HIT with a corrective saccade. Intact brainstem-cerebellar circuitry in central causes typically preserves the HIT (i.e., it is normal).\n    b.   **Nystagmus:** Peripheral nystagmus is unidirectional, horizontal-torsional, and follows Alexander’s law (increases with gaze toward the fast phase). Central nystagmus is often direction-changing gaze-evoked or vertical.\n    c.   **Test of Skew (TOS):** Skew deviation is more common in central (brainstem) lesions.\n    d.   **Hearing Loss:** Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) with a central oculomotor pattern suggests anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) territory infarction. SNHL with a peripheral pattern suggests labyrinthitis.\n    e.   **BPPV:** A triggered episodic syndrome diagnosed with positional maneuvers (Dix-Hallpike for posterior canal, supine roll for horizontal canal). Continuous spontaneous vertigo is not typical of BPPV.\n    f.   **Vascular Risk Factors:** Age $\\geq 60$ years, atrial fibrillation, recent transient ischemic attack (TIA), severe truncal ataxia (unable to sit or stand unaided), and new focal neurological deficits increase pretest probability for central causes and can act as override criteria.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of neurology and otology. The HINTS exam, the pathophysiology of the VOR, the characteristics of central versus peripheral nystagmus, and the clinical presentations of BPPV, labyrinthitis, and posterior circulation stroke are all standard and factual medical knowledge. The information is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It defines a clear objective (design the best decision tree), provides the necessary components and the logic (fundamental base) to evaluate them, and presents a set of mutually exclusive options to choose from. A unique correct answer can be determined by systematically applying the given principles.\n-   **Objective:** The language is clinical, precise, and free of bias. The definitions are clear (e.g., AVS, risk factors). The task is to select the option that is most \"physiologically sound and operationally safe,\" which is an objective evaluation based on the provided \"Fundamental Base\" and established medical practice.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective, providing a clear and consistent set of principles to construct and evaluate a clinical algorithm. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Optimal Algorithm and Evaluation of Options\n\nBased on the provided principles, a correct and safe algorithm would have the following structure:\n\n1.  **Initial Triage by Temporal Pattern:** The two patient populations, AVS and triggered episodic vertigo, have fundamentally different pathologies and diagnostic pathways. AVS requires evaluation for stroke, while triggered vertigo is most commonly BPPV. Therefore, the first logical step is to differentiate between a continuous syndrome (AVS) and a triggered, episodic syndrome.\n2.  **AVS Pathway (HINTS exam):** For patients with AVS, the HINTS exam is the core discriminator. The principles state that a normal HIT, direction-changing nystagmus, or skew deviation are signs of a central lesion. A key safety principle in using HINTS is that the presence of **any single one** of these three signs is sufficient to classify the pattern as \"central\" and warrant further investigation for stroke. A \"peripheral\" HINTS pattern requires all three peripheral signs: an abnormal HIT, unidirectional nystagmus, and no skew.\n3.  **Integration of Hearing Assessment:** For AVS patients, after the HINTS exam, hearing should be assessed. The principle states SNHL + central pattern suggests AICA stroke, while SNHL + peripheral pattern suggests labyrinthitis. A crucial corollary, often termed \"HINTS Plus,\" involves the head-impulse test. AVS with new SNHL and a *normal* HIT is highly suspicious for an AICA territory stroke, even if other HINTS signs are benign.\n4.  **Override Criteria:** The principles list \"severe truncal ataxia\" and \"new focal neurological deficits\" as concerning signs. A safe algorithm must use these as hard override criteria, meaning their presence automatically classifies the patient as high-risk for a central cause, regardless of the HINTS exam results.\n5.  **Triggered Episodic Pathway (Positional Maneuvers):** For patients with brief, positionally triggered vertigo, positional maneuvers (Dix-Hallpike, supine roll) are the appropriate diagnostic tests. A positive test, reproducing brief vertigo with a characteristic nystagmus, confirms BPPV. The algorithm must also recognize atypical findings in this group (e.g., a patient who reports triggered episodes but has continuous spontaneous nystagmus at rest) and re-route them to the AVS pathway for a central workup.\n\nWith this ideal framework in mind, I will now evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A Evaluation:**\n-   \"Start by performing positional maneuvers... on all patients\". This is **Incorrect**. Positional maneuvers are for BPPV (triggered episodic vertigo) and are often poorly tolerated and diagnostically unhelpful in patients with AVS. The initial branching should be based on the temporal pattern of symptoms.\n-   \"require all three central signs... to call a central etiology\". This is **Incorrect** and dangerously insensitive. The established utility of HINTS is that **any one** of the three central signs is a red flag for stroke. Requiring all three would miss the vast majority of strokes diagnosed by HINTS.\n-   \"if new unilateral hearing loss is present, label the case as peripheral labyrinthitis regardless of HINTS findings\". This is **Incorrect** and extremely dangerous. It completely ignores the stated principle that SNHL with a central oculomotor pattern (e.g., a normal HIT) is highly suspicious for an AICA stroke.\n-   \"Vascular risk factors influence disposition but do not change the central versus peripheral classification.\" This is **Incorrect** as it fails to incorporate the stated \"override criteria\" like severe ataxia or new focal deficits.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option B Evaluation:**\n-   \"Begin by separating temporal pattern\". This is the correct initial step.\n-   \"define central etiology only when two or more central HINTS signs are present\". This is **Incorrect**. While better than requiring three signs, it is still unacceptably insensitive. Any single central sign should suffice.\n-   \"If there is new unilateral hearing loss, classify as peripheral unless National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is $\\geq 4$\". This is **Incorrect**. The decision logic for hearing loss should be based on its association with the HINTS findings (specifically the HIT), not an arbitrary cutoff on a general stroke scale that is insensitive to posterior circulation strokes.\n-   \"Do not use severe truncal ataxia or focal neurological deficits to override a peripheral HINTS pattern\". This is **Incorrect** and a critical safety failure. These are major red flags for a central lesion and must act as override criteria, as stated in the problem's fundamental base.\n-   \"...a negative Dix–Hallpike test excludes BPPV.\" This is an **Incorrect** oversimplification. It makes posterior canal BPPV less likely but does not exclude horizontal canal BPPV (which requires a supine roll test) or other variants.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option C Evaluation:**\n-   \"First branch by temporal pattern.\" This is **Correct**.\n-   \"If continuous acute vestibular syndrome is present... perform HINTS... Define central etiology when any one central HINTS sign is present: a normal (bilaterally intact) horizontal head-impulse test, direction-changing gaze-evoked nystagmus, or positive test of skew.\" This is **Correct**. It reflects the appropriately sensitive application of the HINTS exam.\n-   It correctly integrates hearing: \"If HINTS is peripheral... add a simple hearing assessment; with new unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, classify as peripheral labyrinthitis if the head-impulse test is abnormal, but classify as central (anterior inferior cerebellar artery territory stroke) if the head-impulse test is normal.\" This is **Correct**. It perfectly captures the \"HINTS Plus\" logic for differentiating labyrinthitis from AICA stroke.\n-   \"Independently override toward central if there are new focal neurological deficits or severe truncal ataxia... regardless of HINTS.\" This is **Correct**. It incorporates the necessary safety net of hard override criteria.\n-   The logic for the triggered episodic branch is **Correct**. It uses positional maneuvers for BPPV diagnosis and correctly identifies atypical features (continuous nystagmus, etc.) that should prompt re-routing to a central workup.\n-   The handling of vascular risk factors is nuanced and **Correct**: they \"increase central suspicion but do not alone overturn a peripheral HINTS without concerning neurological signs.\"\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option D Evaluation:**\n-   \"Do not separate temporal patterns\". This is **Incorrect**. It is the crucial first step.\n-   \"apply HINTS only after a brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan\". This is **Incorrect**. This inverts the logic. HINTS is a bedside tool used to determine the need for an urgent MRI when one is not immediately available.\n-   \"Classify central when... nystagmus is unidirectional with suppression by fixation.\" This is **Incorrect**. Nystagmus suppression by fixation is a classic sign of a *peripheral* lesion. This statement is the opposite of the known physiology.\n-   \"Treat hearing loss as a benign peripheral marker unless accompanied by diplopia.\" This is **Incorrect** and unsafe, as it misses the AICA stroke mimic of labyrinthitis.\n-   \"Allow vascular risk factors (any single risk factor present) to automatically assign central classification even with a peripheral HINTS pattern.\" This approach is **Incorrect** as it is overly sensitive and would lead to excessive, low-yield testing, contrary to the goal of avoiding inappropriate testing. The correct approach, as in C, is to use major neurological signs (severe ataxia) as overrides, not just any risk factor like age.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption C is the only one that correctly and safely integrates all the fundamental principles provided in the problem statement. It follows the correct sequence of operations, applies the HINTS test with appropriate sensitivity, correctly incorporates hearing assessment and override criteria, and properly manages the two distinct patient populations.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4461484"}]}
