Thresholds at and above $2000$ Hz are preserved.\n- Tympanometry: Normal bilaterally.\n- Excluded history/conditions: Does not meet ICHD criteria for migraine, normal Gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI, negative autoimmune and syphilis serologies, no history of recurrent benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), no ototoxic exposure, no episodic orthostatic lightheadedness.\n- Other vestibular tests: Mild left canal paresis on caloric testing, normal video head impulse test (vHIT).\n- Diagnostic Framework: Consensus definitions from the Bárány Society ($2015$) and the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem presents a detailed clinical vignette and asks for its classification according to specified, widely-accepted medical diagnostic criteria. The data provided are internally consistent, scientifically sound, and clinically plausible. All symptoms, signs, and test results are standard in the field of neurology and otolaryngology. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to arrive at a diagnosis based on the cited criteria. The exclusion of other potential diagnoses is systematic and logical. The problem is therefore valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed by applying the specified diagnostic criteria to the patient's presentation.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe problem requires applying the $2015$ Bárány Society diagnostic criteria for Ménière's disease. These criteria define two main categories: definite Ménière's disease and probable Ménière's disease.\n\nThe criteria for **definite Ménière's disease** are:\n1. Two or more spontaneous episodes of vertigo, each lasting $20$ minutes to $12$ hours.\n2. Audiometrically documented low- to mid-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear on at least one occasion.\n3. Fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing, tinnitus, or fullness) in the affected ear.\n4. Not better accounted for by another vestibular diagnosis.\n\nLet us evaluate the patient's presentation against each of these four criteria:\n1.  **Vertigo Episodes:** The patient experienced \"$5$ spontaneous, severe spinning vertigo episodes... each lasting between $30$ and $90$ minutes\". This meets the requirement of two or more episodes (here, $5$) and a duration within the specified range of $20$ minutes to $12$ hours (here, $30-90$ minutes). This criterion is satisfied.\n2.  **Audiometrically Documented Hearing Loss:** The audiometry \"documents unilateral low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in the left ear with thresholds of $35$ dB HL at $250$ Hz and $40$ dB HL at $500$ Hz\". This is precisely the audiometrically documented low-frequency SNHL required by the criterion. This criterion is satisfied.\n3.  **Fluctuating Aural Symptoms:** The patient reports \"ipsilateral aural fullness\" during attacks and, between attacks, \"fluctuating left-sided tinnitus and intermittent subjective worsening of low-pitched sounds\". These are the classic fluctuating aural symptoms in the affected (left) ear. This criterion is satisfied.\n4.  **Not Better Accounted For by Another Diagnosis:** The problem systematically rules out other potential diagnoses:\n    - Central/structural lesions are excluded by a normal brain MRI.\n    - Vestibular migraine is excluded as the patient does not meet ICHD criteria for migraine and lacks associated migrainous features.\n    - Infectious (syphilis) and autoimmune causes are excluded by negative serologies.\n    - Other peripheral vestibular disorders like BPPV are excluded by history.\n    - Ototoxicity and orthostatic hypotension are also excluded.\n    The clinical picture is a classic presentation of a peripheral inner ear disorder, for which Ménière's disease is the most fitting diagnosis. This criterion is satisfied.\n\nSince all four criteria for definite Ménière's disease are met, this is the correct classification.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Meets criteria for definite Ménière's disease.**\nBased on the analysis above, the patient's presentation fulfills all four criteria for definite Ménière's disease as established by the Bárány Society in $2015$. The number and duration of vertigo episodes, the audiometrically documented low-frequency SNHL, the presence of fluctuating aural symptoms, and the exclusion of other diagnoses all align perfectly with the definition.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Meets criteria for probable Ménière's disease but not definite, because the hearing loss must be high-frequency or pan-frequency to be definite.**\nThis statement is incorrect for a specific reason. The Bárány Society criteria for definite Ménière's disease explicitly state that the characteristic hearing loss is **low- to mid-frequency** SNHL, especially in the early stages of the disease. The patient's low-frequency SNHL is a key feature that *supports*, rather than refutes, the diagnosis of definite Ménière's disease. A requirement for high-frequency or pan-frequency loss is contrary to the established criteria.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Does not meet criteria for probable or definite Ménière's disease, because episodes must last at least $24$ hours.**\nThis statement misrepresents the diagnostic criteria regarding episode duration. The criteria for definite Ménière's disease specify a duration of $20$ minutes to $12$ hours. For probable disease, the range is $20$ minutes to $24$ hours. The patient's episodes of $30-90$ minutes fall well within this required range. A requirement of episodes lasting at least $24$ hours is factually incorrect; such long durations would point away from Ménière's disease and toward other diagnoses.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Does not meet criteria for definite Ménière's disease, because confirmation of endolymphatic hydrops on delayed-gadolinium inner ear MRI is required.**\nThis statement adds a requirement that is not part of the standard $2015$ Bárány Society criteria. While advanced imaging techniques like delayed-gadolinium inner ear MRI can be used to visualize endolymphatic hydrops (the presumed underlying pathology), they are considered ancillary tests. The diagnosis of \"definite Ménière's disease\" is a clinical one, based on the specific constellation of symptoms and audiometric findings. It does not mandate imaging confirmation of hydrops.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Does not meet criteria for definite Ménière's disease, because bilateral hearing loss is required.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. Ménière's disease typically begins as a unilateral condition affecting one ear. While it can become bilateral in a fraction of patients over many years, the diagnostic criteria are formulated to diagnose the condition in its common unilateral form. The criteria require hearing loss in the \"affected ear\", implying a unilateral process is sufficient. There is no requirement for bilateral involvement.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4493666"}, {"introduction": "While the diagnosis is clinical, objective tests can provide crucial support by probing the underlying pathophysiology. This practice focuses on electrocochleography (ECochG), a test designed to detect endolymphatic hydrops, the presumed anatomical substrate of Ménière's disease [@problem_id:4493672]. You will calculate the classic summating potential to action potential (SP/AP) ratio, a key biomarker derived from this test, and interpret its clinical significance.", "problem": "Electrocochleography is used to assess endolymphatic hydrops in suspected Ménière's disease by comparing sustained hair-cell related potential shifts to onset neural activity in response to acoustic clicks. Consider a transtympanic electrocochleography recording acquired with rarefaction clicks at sufficiently high intensity to elicit a robust compound response, under the following measurement conventions: amplitudes are measured as absolute magnitudes relative to the pre-stimulus baseline, and the summating potential reflects the sustained baseline displacement while the compound action potential reflects the onset neural response of the auditory nerve. A clinically used dimensionless index for hydrops screening is constructed by comparing the magnitude of the sustained component to the magnitude of the onset component. You are given a summating potential amplitude of $0.6$ mV and an action potential amplitude of $1.2$ mV. Using first principles of dimensionless scaling and signal amplitude comparison, compute this index.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical neurophysiology, specifically electrocochleography (ECochG) for the assessment of Ménière's disease. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to compute the required index, and its terms are objective and unambiguous.\n\nThe task is to compute a dimensionless index from two given signal amplitudes, based on first principles of dimensionless scaling. A dimensionless quantity can be formed from two quantities that share the same physical dimensions by taking their ratio. The problem describes an index used for hydrops screening, constructed by \"comparing the magnitude of the sustained component to the magnitude of the onset component\".\n\nLet $A_{SP}$ denote the amplitude of the summating potential, which is the sustained hair-cell-related component.\nLet $A_{AP}$ denote the amplitude of the compound action potential, which is the onset neural response component.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the amplitudes are given as:\n$A_{SP} = 0.6 \\text{ mV}$\n$A_{AP} = 1.2 \\text{ mV}$\n\nThe dimensionless index, let us call it $I$, is formed by the comparison of $A_{SP}$ to $A_{AP}$. In the context of signal analysis and clinical diagnostics, this comparison is conventionally a ratio. This specific ratio, $A_{SP} / A_{AP}$, is the standard metric used in ECochG for diagnosing endolymphatic hydrops.\n\nTherefore, the index $I$ is defined as:\n$$\nI = \\frac{A_{SP}}{A_{AP}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into this expression:\n$$\nI = \\frac{0.6}{1.2}\n$$\n\nThe calculation yields:\n$$\nI = 0.5\n$$\n\nThe problem requires a discussion of this result in the context of a given clinical threshold. The decision threshold, $T$, is provided as $T = 0.4$. An elevated index is indicative of endolymphatic hydrops. The condition for a positive screening is $I > T$. In this case, our computed value is $I = 0.5$, which satisfies the condition:\n$$\n0.5 > 0.4\n$$\nTherefore, the calculated index supports the presence of endolymphatic hydrops.\n\nThe final step is to prepare the answer according to the specified formatting. The problem requires the final numeric answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact value of the index is $0.5$. To express this value with three significant figures, we write it as $0.500$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.500}\n$$", "id": "4493672"}, {"introduction": "Clinical diagnosis is an exercise in probabilistic reasoning, where new information updates our confidence in a hypothesis.

The clinic applies a single binary diagnostic criterion derived from audiovestibular testing and longitudinal symptom profiling, consistent with the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) framework. From a high-quality meta-analysis, the criterion has sensitivity $0.85$ and specificity $0.75$ for definite Ménière's disease.

This is the complement of specificity:\n$$P(+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(- \\mid D^c) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$$\n\nNow, we derive the formula for the posterior probability of disease given a positive test, $P(D \\mid +)$, using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is derived from the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(D \\cap +)}{P(+)}$$\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap +)$, can be re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability for $P(+ \\mid D)$:\n$$P(+ \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap +)}{P(D)} \\implies P(D \\cap +) = P(+ \\mid D) P(D)$$\nThe denominator, $P(+)$, is the total probability of a positive test.

First, we compute the denominator, $P(+)$:\n$$P(+) = (0.85)(0.3) + (0.25)(0.7) = 0.255 + 0.175 = 0.43$$\nThen, we compute the posterior probability $P(D \\mid +)$:\n$$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{0.255}{0.43} \\approx 0.59302325...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $P(D \\mid +) \\approx 0.5930$.\n\nNext, we derive the formula for the posterior probability of disease given a negative test, $P(D \\mid -)$. The derivation follows the same logic. From the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(D \\mid -) = \\frac{P(D \\cap -)}{P(-)}$$\nThe numerator can be re-expressed using the definition of $P(- \\mid D)$:\n$$P(- \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap -)}{P(D)} \\implies P(D \\cap -) = P(- \\mid D) P(D)$$\nThe denominator, $P(-)$, is the total probability of a negative test, which we expand using the law of total probability:\n$$P(-) = P(- \\mid D)P(D) + P(- \\mid D^c)P(D^c)$$\nThe full form of Bayes' theorem for this case is:\n$$P(D \\mid -) = \\frac{P(- \\mid D) P(D)}{P(- \\mid D)P(D) + P(- \\mid D^c)P(D^c)}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values. First, we compute the denominator, $P(-)$. Note that $P(-) = 1 - P(+) = 1 - 0.43 = 0.57$. We can also calculate it directly to verify:\n$$P(-) = (0.15)(0.3) + (0.75)(0.7) = 0.045 + 0.525 = 0.57$$\nThe calculation is consistent.
