This foundational exercise [@problem_id:4515908] walks you through the essential first step of quantitative analysis: correcting for PVE to obtain an accurate tissue distribution volume ($V_T$) and then using a reference tissue model to estimate the biologically meaningful binding potential ($BP_{ND}$).", "problem": "A patient with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease undergoes Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using a synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) radioligand to quantify synaptic density. You are provided with region-of-interest values for the hippocampus (target) and the centrum semiovale white matter (reference). The centrum semiovale is assumed to satisfy a valid reference region assumption for this tracer in this cohort: negligible specific binding and equal nondisplaceable distribution volume across regions. The measured total distribution volumes are $V_T^{\\mathrm{meas}}$ for each region, obtained from equilibrium analysis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) segmentation indicates that each region-of-interest contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which dilutes the measured signal. Let the tissue fraction be $\\alpha = 1 - f_{\\mathrm{CSF}}$, where $f_{\\mathrm{CSF}}$ is the CSF fraction in that region. Under the usual partial volume dilution model, the tissue-only total distribution volume is $V_T = V_T^{\\mathrm{meas}} / \\alpha$. The definitions you may use as a base are: at equilibrium, the total distribution volume decomposes as $V_T = V_{ND} + V_S$, where $V_{ND}$ is the nondisplaceable component and $V_S$ is the specific component; the binding potential relative to nondisplaceable, $BP_{ND}$, is defined as $BP_{ND} = V_S / V_{ND}$.

We can proceed with the derivation and computation.\n\nThe objective is to compute the Distribution Volume Ratio ($DVR$) and the binding potential relative to nondisplaceable ($BP_{ND}$) for the hippocampus (target region), using the centrum semiovale as the reference region. Both quantities must be corrected for partial volume effects due to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dilution.\n\nLet the superscript 'target' refer to the hippocampus and 'ref' refer to the centrum semiovale.\n\nThe first step is to correct the measured total distribution volumes ($V_T^{\\mathrm{meas}}$) for CSF contamination. The true tissue-only total distribution volume ($V_T$) is related to the measured value by the formula $V_T = V_T^{\\mathrm{meas}} / \\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is the tissue fraction, given by $\\alpha = 1 - f_{\\mathrm{CSF}}$.\n\nFor the target region (hippocampus):\nThe given CSF fraction is $f_{\\mathrm{CSF, target}} = 0.18$.\nThe tissue fraction is $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{target}} = 1 - f_{\\mathrm{CSF, target}} = 1 - 0.18 = 0.82$.\nThe measured total distribution volume is $V_{T, \\mathrm{target}}^{\\mathrm{meas}} = 13.2~\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\nThe corrected total distribution volume for the target region is:\n$$V_{T, \\mathrm{target}} = \\frac{V_{T, \\mathrm{target}}^{\\mathrm{meas}}}{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{target}}} = \\frac{13.2}{0.82} \\approx 16.09756~\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\n\nFor the reference region (centrum semiovale):\nThe given CSF fraction is $f_{\\mathrm{CSF, ref}} = 0.30$.\nThe tissue fraction is $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 1 - f_{\\mathrm{CSF, ref}} = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\nThe measured total distribution volume is $V_{T, \\mathrm{ref}}^{\\mathrm{meas}} = 6.0~\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\nThe corrected total distribution volume for the reference region is:\n$$V_{T, \\mathrm{ref}} = \\frac{V_{T, \\mathrm{ref}}^{\\mathrm{meas}}}{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{6.0}{0.70} \\approx 8.57143~\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\n\nWith the corrected distribution volumes, we can now compute the $DVR$.

This assumption implies two conditions:\n1.  The specific binding in the reference region is negligible: $V_{S, \\mathrm{ref}} = 0$.\n2.  The nondisplaceable distribution volume is equal across regions: $V_{ND, \\mathrm{target}} = V_{ND, \\mathrm{ref}}$.\n\nFrom the first condition, the total distribution volume in the reference region simplifies to:\n$$V_{T, \\mathrm{ref}} = V_{ND, \\mathrm{ref}} + V_{S, \\mathrm{ref}} = V_{ND, \\mathrm{ref}} + 0 = V_{ND, \\mathrm{ref}}$$\nCombining this with the second condition, we find that the nondisplaceable volume in the target region is equal to the total distribution volume in the reference region:\n$$V_{ND, \\mathrm{target}} = V_{ND, \\mathrm{ref}} = V_{T, \\mathrm{ref}}$$\nNow we can substitute $V_{T, \\mathrm{ref}}$ for $V_{ND, \\mathrm{target}}$ in the expression for $BP_{ND, \\mathrm{target}}$:\n$$BP_{ND, \\mathrm{target}} = \\frac{V_{T, \\mathrm{target}}}{V_{T, \\mathrm{ref}}} - 1$$\nWe recognize that the ratio $V_{T, \\mathrm{target}} / V_{T, \\mathrm{ref}}$ is the $DVR$. Therefore, the relationship is:\n$$BP_{ND} = DVR - 1$$\nUsing the previously calculated value for $DVR$:\n$$BP_{ND} = 1.87804878 - 1 = 0.87804878$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $BP_{ND} = 0.8780$.
