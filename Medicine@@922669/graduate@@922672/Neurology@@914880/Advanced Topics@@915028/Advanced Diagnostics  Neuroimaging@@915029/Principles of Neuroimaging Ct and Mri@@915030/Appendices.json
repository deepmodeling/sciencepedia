The sequence is designed to be fully symmetric about the center of the refocusing radiofrequency (RF) pulse to ensure perfect refocusing of static field inhomogeneity and balanced gradient moments at the echo. The following timing and gradient specifications are used:\n\n- A $90^\\circ$ RF pulse of duration $3\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ is applied at sequence start, with its time-center at $t=1.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.

I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities: the echo time ($\\mathrm{TE}$) of a spin-echo sequence and the resulting signal ratio between gray matter and white matter.\n\nFirst, we determine the echo time, $\\mathrm{TE}$. In a spin-echo sequence, the echo is formed by applying a $180^\\circ$ refocusing pulse after an initial $90^\\circ$ excitation pulse. The fundamental principle of spin-echo formation dictates that the time interval from the center of the $90^\\circ$ pulse to the center of the $180^\\circ$ pulse is equal to the time interval from the center of the $180^\\circ$ pulse to the center of the echo. The various gradient lobes are designed to be symmetric around the $180^\\circ$ pulse to ensure this refocusing occurs perfectly for all spins within the selected slice, regardless of their position and static field offsets.\n\nLet $t_{90}$ be the time corresponding to the center of the $90^\\circ$ excitation pulse, $t_{180}$ be the time corresponding to the center of the $180^\\circ$ refocusing pulse, and $t_{\\text{echo}}$ be the time corresponding to the center of the spin echo. The symmetry condition is expressed as:\n$$t_{\\text{echo}} - t_{180} = t_{180} - t_{90}$$\nThe echo time, $\\mathrm{TE}$, is formally defined as the duration from the center of the excitation pulse to the center of the echo:\n$$\\mathrm{TE} = t_{\\text{echo}} - t_{90}$$\nFrom the symmetry equation, we can express $t_{\\text{echo}}$ as $t_{\\text{echo}} = 2t_{180} - t_{90}$.

The effective resolution is the FWHM of the total slice sensitivity profile, which results from the convolution of multiple blurring components.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total beam width, $W$.

The composite point-spread function is the convolution of the individual PSFs. For Gaussian functions, convolution results in another Gaussian function whose variance ($\\sigma^2$) is the sum of the variances of the convolved functions. The relationship between FWHM and standard deviation $\\sigma$ for a Gaussian is $FWHM = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}\\,\\sigma$. This implies that $FWHM^2$ is proportional to $\\sigma^2$. Therefore, the square of the final FWHM is the sum of the squares of the individual FWHMs:\n$$FWHM_{z,\\mathrm{eff}}^2 = FWHM_{coll}^2 + FWHM_{interp}^2$$\n\nThe first component is the collimation-limited blur, whose FWHM is given as the reconstructed slice thickness, $t$.\n$$FWHM_{coll} = t = 0.625\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThe second component is the blur introduced by helical interpolation. Its FWHM is given to be proportional to the product of the helical pitch $p$ and the total beam width $W$, with a proportionality constant $k = 0.030$.\n$$FWHM_{interp} = k \\cdot p \\cdot W$$\nSubstituting the expression for pitch, $p = \\Delta z / W$, we see that this simplifies:\n$$FWHM_{interp} = k \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\Delta z}{W}\\right) \\cdot W = k \\cdot \\Delta z$$\nUsing the calculated value for $\\Delta z$:\n$$FWHM_{interp} = 0.030 \\times 24\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.72\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the effective longitudinal resolution, $FWHM_{z,\\mathrm{eff}}$, by combining the two components in quadrature:\n$$FWHM_{z,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sqrt{FWHM_{coll}^2 + FWHM_{interp}^2}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$FWHM_{z,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sqrt{(0.625\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2 + (0.72\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2}$$\n$$FWHM_{z,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sqrt{0.390625\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 + 0.5184\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2}$$\n$$FWHM_{z,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sqrt{0.909025\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2}$$\n$$FWHM_{z,\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 0.9534280... \\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final result for $FWHM_{z,\\mathrm{eff}}$ to four significant figures.\n$$FWHM_{z,\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 0.9534\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThis value represents the effective slice thickness, or the resolution along the patient axis, for this specific helical CT acquisition and reconstruction protocol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9534}$$", "id": "4517980"}, {"introduction": "An ideal imaging system would map the properties of an object with perfect fidelity, but in reality, all tomographic techniques are subject to artifacts arising from the physics of data acquisition and reconstruction.

This means that the reconstructed linear attenuation coefficient for a voxel containing multiple materials, which we denote as $\\bar{\\mu}_{\\text{voxel}}$, is the volume-fraction-weighted average of the attenuation coefficients of its constituent materials.\n\nLet a voxel of total volume $V_{\\text{voxel}}$ be composed of two materials: material $1$ (hemorrhage) with volume $V_1$ and attenuation coefficient $\\mu_1$, and material $2$ (parenchyma) with volume $V_2$ and attenuation coefficient $\\mu_2$. The sphere is entirely within the voxel, so $V_1 + V_2 = V_{\\text{voxel}}$.\nThe volume fractions are $f_1 = V_1 / V_{\\text{voxel}}$ and $f_2 = V_2 / V_{\\text{voxel}}$, with $f_1 + f_2 = 1$.\n\nThe linear mixing assumption implies:\n$$ \\bar{\\mu}_{\\text{voxel}} = f_1 \\mu_1 + f_2 \\mu_2 $$\nLet $\\text{HU}_{\\text{voxel}}$ be the Hounsfield unit value of the reconstructed voxel, and let $\\text{HU}_1$ and $\\text{HU}_2$ be the HU values for pure material $1$ and material $2$, respectively. We can substitute the expression for $\\mu$ in terms of HU into the averaging equation:\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{water}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\text{HU}_{\\text{voxel}}}{K} \\right) = f_1 \\left[ \\mu_{\\text{water}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\text{HU}_1}{K} \\right) \\right] + f_2 \\left[ \\mu_{\\text{water}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\text{HU}_2}{K} \\right) \\right] $$\nThe constant $\\mu_{\\text{water}}$ is present in every term and can be cancelled:\n$$ 1 + \\frac{\\text{HU}_{\\text{voxel}}}{K} = f_1 \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\text{HU}_1}{K} \\right) + f_2 \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\text{HU}_2}{K} \\right) $$\nExpanding the right side gives:\n$$ 1 + \\frac{\\text{HU}_{\\text{voxel}}}{K} = f_1 + \\frac{f_1 \\text{HU}_1}{K} + f_2 + \\frac{f_2 \\text{HU}_2}{K} $$\nSince the sum of volume fractions is unity ($f_1 + f_2 = 1$), this simplifies to:\n$$ 1 + \\frac{\\text{HU}_{\\text{voxel}}}{K} = 1 + \\frac{f_1 \\text{HU}_1 + f_2 \\text{HU}_2}{K} $$\nSubtracting $1$ from both sides and then multiplying by $K$ yields the desired relationship:\n$$ \\text{HU}_{\\text{voxel}} = f_1 \\text{HU}_1 + f_2 \\text{HU}_2 $$\nThis proves that under the assumption of linear attenuation mixing, the reconstructed HU of a voxel is the volume-fraction-weighted average of the HU values of its components.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of Attenuation Bias\nWe now apply this result to compute the attenuation bias.\n\n1.  **Calculate the volume of the voxel ($V_{\\text{voxel}}$):**\n    The voxel has dimensions $1.0 \\,\\text{mm} \\times 1.0 \\,\\text{mm} \\times 5.0 \\,\\text{mm}$.\n    $$ V_{\\text{voxel}} = (1.0 \\,\\text{mm}) \\times (1.0 \\,\\text{mm}) \\times (5.0 \\,\\text{mm}) = 5.0 \\,\\text{mm}^3 $$\n\n2.  **Calculate the volume of the hemorrhage ($V_h$):**\n    The hemorrhage is a sphere with radius $r = 0.50 \\,\\text{mm}$.\n    $$ V_h = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (0.50 \\,\\text{mm})^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi (0.125 \\,\\text{mm}^3) = \\frac{0.5}{3} \\pi \\,\\text{mm}^3 = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\,\\text{mm}^3 $$\n\n3.  **Calculate the volume fractions:**\n    The volume fraction of hemorrhage ($f_h$) is the ratio of its volume to the voxel volume.\n    $$ f_h = \\frac{V_h}{V_{\\text{voxel}}} = \\frac{(\\pi/6) \\,\\text{mm}^3}{5.0 \\,\\text{mm}^3} = \\frac{\\pi}{30} $$\n    The remainder of the voxel is parenchyma, so its volume fraction ($f_p$) is:\n    $$ f_p = 1 - f_h = 1 - \\frac{\\pi}{30} $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the measured voxel HU ($\\text{HU}_{\\text{voxel}}$):**\n    Using the volume-weighted average formula with the given HU values ($\\text{HU}_h = 65$, $\\text{HU}_p = 35$):\n    $$ \\text{HU}_{\\text{voxel}} = f_h \\text{HU}_h + f_p \\text{HU}_p $$\n    $$ \\text{HU}_{\\text{voxel}} = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{30}\\right)(65) + \\left(1 - \\frac{\\pi}{30}\\right)(35) $$\n    $$ \\text{HU}_{\\text{voxel}} = \\frac{65\\pi}{30} + 35 - \\frac{35\\pi}{30} $$\n    $$ \\text{HU}_{\\text{voxel}} = 35 + \\frac{(65 - 35)\\pi}{30} = 35 + \\frac{30\\pi}{30} $$\n    $$ \\text{HU}_{\\text{voxel}} = 35 + \\pi $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the attenuation bias:**\n    The bias is defined as the difference between the measured voxel HU and the HU of pure hemorrhage.\n    $$ \\text{Bias} = \\text{HU}_{\\text{voxel}} - \\text{HU}_h $$\n    $$ \\text{Bias} = (35 + \\pi) - 65 $$\n    $$ \\text{Bias} = \\pi - 30 $$\n\n6.  **Final numerical value:**\n    Using the value of $\\pi \\approx 3.14159265...$:\n    $$ \\text{Bias} \\approx 3.14159265 - 30 = -26.85840735... $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get:\n    $$ \\text{Bias} \\approx -26.86 \\,\\text{HU} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-26.86}$$", "id": "4517999"}]}
