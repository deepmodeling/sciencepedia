Validation Analysis**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in the principles of biostatistics and diagnostic medicine. The concepts of sensitivity, specificity, ROC curves, and decision thresholds are standard, well-established tools for evaluating binary classifiers. The context of using a biomarker (p-tau217) for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis is scientifically current and realistic.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for the derivation of a specific quantity (vertical distance on an ROC plot) and its calculation. The geometric description uniquely defines the index. The provided data are sufficient to perform the calculation.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and mathematical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary definitions and data. There are no internal contradictions.\n- **Realism:** The sensitivity and specificity values ($0.89$ and $0.92$) are realistic for a high-performance diagnostic test. The entire scenario mirrors a standard procedure in clinical test validation.\n\n**1.3. Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective problem in biostatistics.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds by first defining the space in which the ROC curve is plotted and then deriving the expression for the index based on its geometric definition.\n\nAn ROC curve is a plot of the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) for varying values of the decision threshold $\\tau$.\n\nThe True Positive Rate is the probability of a positive test result given that the subject has the disease. By the problem's definition, this is sensitivity:\n$$\n\\text{TPR}(\\tau) = P(\\hat{Y}=1 \\mid Y=1) = \\text{Sensitivity}(\\tau)\n$$\n\nThe False Positive Rate is the probability of a positive test result given that the subject does not have the disease:\n$$\n\\text{FPR}(\\tau) = P(\\hat{Y}=1 \\mid Y=0)\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the definition of specificity, which is the True Negative Rate (TNR):\n$$\n\\text{Specificity}(\\tau) = P(\\hat{Y}=0 \\mid Y=0)\n$$\n\nFor a given conditional state $Y=0$, the sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes for $\\hat{Y}$ must be $1$. That is, $P(\\hat{Y}=1 \\mid Y=0) + P(\\hat{Y}=0 \\mid Y=0) = 1$.\nSubstituting the definitions of FPR and specificity, we get:\n$$\n\\text{FPR}(\\tau) + \\text{Specificity}(\\tau) = 1\n$$\nThis allows us to express the FPR in terms of specificity:\n$$\n\\text{FPR}(\\tau) = 1 - \\text{Specificity}(\\tau)\n$$\n\nFor any given threshold $\\tau$, a point on the ROC curve is defined by the coordinates $(\\text{FPR}(\\tau), \\text{TPR}(\\tau))$. Using the definitions of sensitivity and specificity, this point is $(1 - \\text{Specificity}(\\tau), \\text{Sensitivity}(\\tau))$.\n\nThe chance line (or line of no-discrimination) in ROC space is the line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$. This line corresponds to a classifier that performs no better than random guessing. The equation of this line is $\\text{TPR} = \\text{FPR}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the vertical displacement of the ROC point from the chance line. For a given x-coordinate, $\\text{FPR}(\\tau)$, the corresponding point on the ROC curve has a y-coordinate of $\\text{TPR}(\\tau)$. The point on the chance line with the same x-coordinate has a y-coordinate equal to its x-coordinate, which is $\\text{FPR}(\\tau)$.\n\nThe vertical displacement, which we will call the index $J(\\tau)$, is the difference between these two y-coordinates:\n$$\nJ(\\tau) = \\text{TPR}(\\tau) - \\text{FPR}(\\tau)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of sensitivity and specificity, we obtain the formula for the index:\n$$\nJ(\\tau) = \\text{Sensitivity}(\\tau) - (1 - \\text{Specificity}(\\tau))\n$$\n$$\nJ(\\tau) = \\text{Sensitivity}(\\tau) + \\text{Specificity}(\\tau) - 1\n$$\nThis index is known as Youden's J statistic.\n\nNext, we justify its use as an optimization criterion under the specified constraints. The goal is to choose a threshold $\\tau$ that optimizes test performance, where \"optimal\" means false positives and false negatives are weighted equally, and the decision is independent of disease prevalence.\n\nWe can express $J(\\tau)$ in terms of the error rates. The False Negative Rate (FNR) is $P(\\hat{Y}=0 \\mid Y=1) = 1 - P(\\hat{Y}=1 \\mid Y=1) = 1 - \\text{TPR}(\\tau)$. The False Positive Rate (FPR) is $P(\\hat{Y}=1 \\mid Y=0)$.\nThe index is $J(\\tau) = \\text{TPR}(\\tau) - \\text{FPR}(\\tau) = (1 - \\text{FNR}(\\tau)) - \\text{FPR}(\\tau) = 1 - (\\text{FNR}(\\tau) + \\text{FPR}(\\tau))$.\n\nMaximizing $J(\\tau)$ is therefore mathematically equivalent to minimizing the sum of the two conditional error rates, $\\text{FNR}(\\tau) + \\text{FPR}(\\tau)$. This minimization corresponds to a cost function where the \"cost\" of a false negative and the \"cost\" of a false positive are assigned equal weight, and where the base rates of the disease (prevalence) are not considered. Thus, maximizing $J(\\tau)$ is a valid optimization strategy under the conditions specified in the problem statement. The threshold $\\tau$ that maximizes $J(\\tau)$ is the one that provides the greatest separation between the diseased and non-diseased populations, as measured by the sum of sensitivity and specificity.\n\nFinally, we compute the value of this index for the given cutoff $\\tau^{\\ast}$, where Sensitivity $= 0.89$ and Specificity $= 0.92$.\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$\nJ(\\tau^{\\ast}) = \\text{Sensitivity}(\\tau^{\\ast}) + \\text{Specificity}(\\tau^{\\ast}) - 1\n$$\n$$\nJ(\\tau^{\\ast}) = 0.89 + 0.92 - 1\n$$\n$$\nJ(\\tau^{\\ast}) = 1.81 - 1\n$$\n$$\nJ(\\tau^{\\ast}) = 0.81\n$$\nThe value of the index at the specified threshold is $0.81$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.81}\n$$", "id": "4468159"}, {"introduction": "A biomarker's measured value is not static; it can be significantly affected by how a sample is handled between collection and analysis.
