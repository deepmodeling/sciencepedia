Let the network be represented as a directed graph with nodes corresponding to hippocampal and cortical populations and edges representing effective synaptic couplings with weights $w_{ij}$ from hippocampal node $i$ to cortical node $j$. During sleep, hippocampal replay reactivates previously experienced patterns, driving coordinated activity in the indexed cortical sets. Assume the following fundamental bases and idealizations that are widely accepted in neuroscience:\n- Hebb’s postulate of learning: coactivation of presynaptic and postsynaptic units increases the synaptic efficacy.\n- Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP): synaptic weight changes are determined by the temporal correlation of presynaptic and postsynaptic spike trains convolved with an STDP kernel that favors causal timing.\n- The rate-based limit of STDP: for low to moderate firing rates and short correlation times, synaptic changes can be approximated by a function of the cross-correlation of firing rates.\n\nIn this model, assume that each replay event transiently coactivates hippocampal node $i$ and cortical node $j$ in near synchrony such that the event-averaged coactivity is normalized to $\\langle r_i r_j \\rangle_{\\text{event}} = 1$ (dimensionless). The learning-rate parameter per coactivity unit is $\\eta$, taken to be constant across events. Across the night, replay events are statistically independent and identically distributed in their coactivity statistics.\n\nStarting from the above fundamental bases, formally derive the rate-based synaptic update rule for the edge $i \\to j$ under synchronous replay, expressed in terms of the presynaptic and postsynaptic activities. Then, using this derived rule, compute the total strengthening of a single hippocampal-to-cortical edge after $5$ nights, given nightly $10^{5}$ replay events and $\\eta = 10^{-6}$. Treat synaptic weight as a dimensionless quantity. Express your final answer as a single real number. No rounding is necessary if an exact value is obtained.", "solution": "The problem requires us to first derive a rate-based synaptic update rule from fundamental principles of neural plasticity and then use this rule to calculate the total synaptic strengthening of a specific connection over a given period.\n\nFirst, we address the derivation of the synaptic update rule for the weight $w_{ij}$ of the connection from a presynaptic hippocampal node $i$ to a postsynaptic cortical node $j$. The problem statement provides three foundational assumptions:\n$1$. Hebb’s postulate: The coactivation of presynaptic and postsynaptic units leads to an increase in synaptic efficacy.\n$2$. Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP): The change in synaptic weight is a function of the precise timing of pre- and post-synaptic spikes.\n$3$. The rate-based limit of STDP: For low to moderate firing rates and short correlation times, this change can be approximated as a function of the cross-correlation of the neuronal firing rates, denoted by $r_i$ and $r_j$ for the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, respectively.\n\nThe problem specifies that replay events involve \"near synchrony\". In the context of STDP, synchronous or near-synchronous firing (presynaptic spike immediately followed by a postsynaptic spike) leads to Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), i.e., a strengthening of the synapse. In the rate-based approximation, the complex STDP kernel, which depends on the time lag between spikes, simplifies significantly. For synchronous activity, the change in synaptic weight is maximized and positive.\n\nThe most direct mathematical formalization of Hebb's postulate in a rate-based framework is that the change in synaptic weight, $\\Delta w_{ij}$, is proportional to the product of the firing rates of the connected neurons. This correlational rule is the mathematical expression of \"neurons that fire together, wire together\".\n$$ \\Delta w_{ij} \\propto r_i r_j $$\nThe problem asks for an update rule based on a discrete \"replay event\". We can express the change per event, $\\Delta w_{ij, \\text{event}}$, by integrating the instantaneous change over the duration of an event. However, the problem simplifies this by providing an \"event-averaged coactivity\", $\\langle r_i r_j \\rangle_{\\text{event}}$, and a \"learning-rate parameter per coactivity unit\", $\\eta$. This directly implies a discrete update rule where the change per event is the product of the learning rate and the measure of coactivity for that event.\n\nThus, based on the provided principles and definitions, the rate-based synaptic update rule for a single replay event is:\n$$ \\Delta w_{ij, \\text{event}} = \\eta \\cdot \\langle r_i r_j \\rangle_{\\text{event}} $$\nThis equation is the formal expression of the rule in terms of presynaptic and postsynaptic activities, as required.\n\nNext, we use this derived rule to compute the total strengthening of a single hippocampal-to-cortical edge after $5$ nights. The problem provides the following values:\n- Number of nights: $N_{\\text{nights}} = 5$.\n- Number of replay events per night: $N_{\\text{events per night}} = 10^5$.\n- Learning rate: $\\eta = 10^{-6}$.\n- Event-averaged coactivity: $\\langle r_i r_j \\rangle_{\\text{event}} = 1$.\n\nThe synaptic weight $w_{ij}$, the learning rate $\\eta$, and the coactivity term are all specified to be dimensionless quantities.\n\nFirst, we calculate the strengthening from a single replay event using our derived rule:\n$$ \\Delta w_{\\text{event}} = \\eta \\cdot \\langle r_i r_j \\rangle_{\\text{event}} = 10^{-6} \\times 1 = 10^{-6} $$\n\nNext, we determine the total number of replay events, $N_{\\text{total}}$, across all nights:\n$$ N_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{nights}} \\times N_{\\text{events per night}} = 5 \\times 10^5 $$\n\nThe problem states that \"replay events are statistically independent and identically distributed\". This implies that the total change in synaptic weight, $\\Delta W_{\\text{total}}$, is the linear sum of the changes from each individual event. This assumption of additivity is valid as long as the change per event is small, which is true here given the small value of $\\eta$.\n\nTherefore, the total strengthening is the product of the total number of events and the strengthening per event:\n$$ \\Delta W_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{total}} \\times \\Delta w_{\\text{event}} $$\nSubstituting the values we have:\n$$ \\Delta W_{\\text{total}} = (5 \\times 10^5) \\times 10^{-6} $$\n$$ \\Delta W_{\\text{total}} = 5 \\times 10^{5-6} = 5 \\times 10^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta W_{\\text{total}} = 0.5 $$\n\nThe total strengthening of the single hippocampal-to-cortical edge after $5$ nights is $0.5$.

The exponential function is always positive. Therefore, each term in the expression for $F'(t)$ is strictly positive for all $t \\ge 0$. This means $F'(t)  0$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\nSince its derivative is always positive, the function $F(t)$ is strictly monotonically increasing. A strictly monotonic function can cross the axis at most once.\nBecause we have already established the existence of at least one root, we can now conclude there is exactly one root $t^{\\ast}0$.\nFurthermore, because $F(t)$ is strictly increasing, for any $t  t^{\\ast}$, it must be that $F(t)  F(t^{\\ast})=0$.

In an experimental context, this indicates a statistically significant temporal coupling between these two brain rhythms. This coupling is a cornerstone of the systems memory consolidation theory, which posits that memories are transferred from the hippocampus (a temporary store) to the neocortex (a long-term store) during sleep. The slow oscillation, generated in the neocortex, is thought to orchestrate this process by creating time windows of increased neuronal excitability. The fact that hippocampal ripples—neural events associated with the \"replay\" of waking experiences—are phase-locked to the slow oscillation suggests a mechanism for precisely timed communication between the hippocampus and neocortex, which is essential for the stabilization and integration of memories.
