The concepts of diffusion-limited reactions, Poisson statistics for arrival events, and signal-to-noise analysis are standard and well-established in physics and biology. The model is a simplification but is grounded in correct physical principles.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary parameters ($N, T, D, a, C$) and a clear, objective criterion ($SNR=1$) to derive a unique analytical solution.\n-   **Objective:** The language is precise and quantitative. Terms like \"perfectly absorbing,\" \"diffusion-limited,\" and \"Poisson statistics\" have clear, formal definitions.\n-   **Completeness:** The problem is self-contained. The instruction to assume independent receptor hit counts resolves a potential ambiguity regarding receptor interference (shielding effects), making the problem solvable with the given information.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is a valid problem. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe derivation proceeds as follows. First, we define the signal and noise for the differential measurement. Second, we calculate the signal, which is the expected difference in the number of ligand hits between the right and left halves of the growth cone. Third, we calculate the noise, which is the standard deviation of this difference, arising from the stochastic nature of molecular arrivals. Fourth, we construct the signal-to-noise ratio ($SNR$) and apply the detection criterion ($SNR=1$) to find the minimal detectable fractional concentration difference.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n1.  **Independent Receptors:** As stated in the problem, the $N$ receptors operate independently. The capture of a ligand by one receptor does not affect the probability of capture by another. This implies we can neglect the effect of \"receptor shielding\" where receptors compete for the same pool of ligands.\n2.  **Small Gradient:** The spatial concentration difference across the growth cone is small. We can model the concentration on the left half ($C_L$) and right half ($C_R$) as small perturbations around the average background concentration $C$. Let $C_R - C_L = \\Delta C$. We can write $C_L = C - \\frac{\\Delta C}{2}$ and $C_R = C + \\frac{\\Delta C}{2}$, which is a first-order approximation valid for $\\Delta C \\ll C$.\n\n**1. Fundamental Flux Equation**\nThe problem asks to start from the fundamental result for diffusion-limited flux to a small absorber. For a single, perfectly absorbing sphere of radius $a$ in a medium of uniform concentration $C$ and diffusion constant $D$, the steady-state rate of capture (flux) $\\Phi$ is given by the Smoluchowski rate equation:\n$$\n\\Phi = 4 \\pi D a C\n$$\nThe expected number of molecules, $\\langle k \\rangle$, captured in an integration time $T$ by a single receptor is:\n$$\n\\langle k \\rangle = \\Phi T = 4 \\pi D a C T\n$$\n\n**2. Signal Calculation**\nThe growth cone is divided into two halves, left and right, each with $N/2$ receptors. The concentration on the left is $C_L$ and on the right is $C_R$.\nUsing the independent receptor assumption, the total expected number of hits on the left half, $\\langle k_L \\rangle$, is the sum of hits on its $N/2$ receptors:\n$$\n\\langle k_L \\rangle = \\frac{N}{2} \\times (4 \\pi D a C_L T) = 2 \\pi N D a T C_L\n$$\nSimilarly, for the right half:\n$$\n\\langle k_R \\rangle = \\frac{N}{2} \\times (4 \\pi D a C_R T) = 2 \\pi N D a T C_R\n$$\nThe signal, $S$, is defined as the difference in the mean number of hits:\n$$\nS = \\langle k_R \\rangle - \\langle k_L \\rangle = 2 \\pi N D a T (C_R - C_L)\n$$\nSubstituting $C_R - C_L = \\Delta C$, we get:\n$$\nS = 2 \\pi N D a T \\Delta C\n$$\n\n**3. Noise Calculation**\nThe problem states that receptor hit counts are independent and obey Poisson statistics. A fundamental property of a Poisson process is that its variance is equal to its mean.\nThe variance of the number of hits on the left half is $\\sigma_L^2 = \\langle k_L \\rangle$.\nThe variance of the number of hits on the right half is $\\sigma_R^2 = \\langle k_R \\rangle$.\nThe noise, $N_{noise}$, is the standard deviation of the difference in counts, $k_R - k_L$. Since the counts on the left and right halves are independent, the variance of their difference is the sum of their variances:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{diff}}^2 = \\text{Var}(k_R - k_L) = \\text{Var}(k_R) + \\text{Var}(k_L) = \\sigma_R^2 + \\sigma_L^2 = \\langle k_R \\rangle + \\langle k_L \\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\langle k_R \\rangle$ and $\\langle k_L \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{diff}}^2 = 2 \\pi N D a T C_R + 2 \\pi N D a T C_L = 2 \\pi N D a T (C_R + C_L)\n$$\nUsing our small gradient assumption, $C_R + C_L = (C + \\frac{\\Delta C}{2}) + (C - \\frac{\\Delta C}{2}) = 2C$.\nThus, the variance of the difference is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{diff}}^2 = 2 \\pi N D a T (2C) = 4 \\pi N D a T C\n$$\nThe noise is the standard deviation, $N_{noise} = \\sigma_{\\text{diff}}$:\n$$\nN_{noise} = \\sqrt{4 \\pi N D a T C} = 2 \\sqrt{\\pi N D a T C}\n$$\n\n**4. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Detection Limit**\nThe SNR is the ratio of the signal to the noise:\n$$\n\\text{SNR} = \\frac{S}{N_{noise}} = \\frac{2 \\pi N D a T \\Delta C}{2 \\sqrt{\\pi N D a T C}}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression:\n$$\n\\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\pi N D a T \\Delta C}{\\sqrt{\\pi N D a T C}} = \\sqrt{\\pi N D a T C} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta C}{C} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the minimal detectable difference is found when the SNR equals $1$. Setting $\\text{SNR} = 1$:\n$$\n1 = \\sqrt{\\pi N D a T C} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta C}{C} \\right)_{\\text{min}}\n$$\nSolving for the minimal detectable fractional concentration difference, $\\left( \\frac{\\Delta C}{C} \\right)_{\\text{min}}$:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\Delta C}{C} \\right)_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi N D a T C}}\n$$\nThis expression is the fundamental physical limit for detecting a chemical gradient by counting molecular arrivals.\n\n**Discussion of Constraints**\nThe derived expression $\\left( \\frac{\\Delta C}{C} \\right)_{\\text{min}} = (\\pi N D a T C)^{-1/2}$ reveals how various physical and biological parameters constrain the ability of a growth cone to detect shallow gradients. The limit is determined by the total number of \"signal\" molecules collected, which is proportional to the product $N D a T C$.\n\n-   **Scaling:** The minimal detectable gradient scales as the inverse square root of each parameter: $N^{-1/2}$, $T^{-1/2}$, $D^{-1/2}$, $a^{-1/2}$, and $C^{-1/2}$. This implies a law of diminishing returns. For example, to improve sensitivity by a factor of $2$ (i.e., to detect a gradient half as shallow), the cell must either quadruple the number of receptors ($N$) or quadruple the integration time ($T$).\n\n-   **Parameter Regimes Enabling/Precluding Detection:**\n    -   **Enabling Detection:** Detection of very small $\\Delta C/C$ is possible in parameter regimes where the product $N D a T C$ is large. This occurs if the growth cone has a very high number of receptors ($N$), integrates information over a long time ($T$), the ligand is small and diffuses quickly ($D$), the receptor-ligand interaction has a large effective capture radius ($a$), and/or the background concentration of the cue ($C$) is high.\n    -   **Precluding Detection:** Detection is fundamentally limited, and may be precluded, in regimes where the product $N D a T C$ is small. This is a significant challenge in developmental neuroscience. For instance, guidance cues can be large, slowly-diffusing proteins (small $D$), expressed at very low concentrations (small $C$). Furthermore, a growth cone must navigate in a timely manner, placing a biological constraint on the maximum integration time ($T$). If these factors conspire to make the value of $(\\pi N D a T C)^{-1/2}$ larger than the actual fractional gradient present in the tissue, reliable detection is physically impossible due to the overwhelming shot noise from the random arrival of molecules. This physical limit underscores the necessity for biological mechanisms not included in this simple model—such as intracellular signal amplification cascades and sophisticated temporal filtering—to achieve the remarkable navigational accuracy observed in the nervous system.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi N D a T C}}} $$", "id": "4452595"}, {"introduction": "In the developing nervous system, growth cones navigate a complex landscape by integrating multiple, often conflicting, signals.

For the EphA/ephrin-A system, the normative one-dimensional topography pairs high EphA temporal axons with low ephrin-A anterior tectum. In index terms for $N$ discrete sites, this implies a baseline mapping index $j_{0,i}$ for retinal index $i$ given by $j_{0,i} = (N-1) - i$.\n- Capacity constraint: The mapping is a bijection from $N$ retinal indices to $N$ tectal indices (one-to-one).\n- Partial lesion: The posterior tectal ephrin-A profile is scaled by a specified factor at and beyond a given cut index, reducing the ligand in that region.\n\nYour task is to derive, from these principles, a tractable additive energy per axon-target pair that (i) increases with the product of the retinal EphA receptor level and the tectal ephrin-A ligand level, and (ii) penalizes deviations from the baseline topographic index $j_{0,i}$. Use this to construct a pairwise additive cost matrix over all retinal–tectal index pairs that encodes both the repulsive interaction and a quadratic wiring cost around $j_{0,i}$, and then compute the globally minimal-energy one-to-one assignment.\n\nDefine a misprojection at tectal site $j$ if the assigned retinal axon index $i$ deviates from its baseline target by at least a specified integer tolerance $\\tau$ when measured as $|j - j_{0,i}| \\ge \\tau$. Group all such sites into maximal contiguous intervals $[j_{\\mathrm{start}}, j_{\\mathrm{end}}]$ with inclusive integer indices. The output for a test case is the list of these intervals, each interval represented as a two-element list $[j_{\\mathrm{start}}, j_{\\mathrm{end}}]$. If there are no misprojections, output the empty list.\n\nImplement a program that, for each of the following test cases, performs the lesion, constructs the cost matrix, solves the one-to-one assignment that minimizes the total energy, detects misprojection zones as defined, and outputs the intervals for each case.\n\nUse the following test suite. All expression levels are dimensionless. All indices are zero-based integers. For each case, $N$ is the number of sites, $R[i]$ is the retinal EphA profile, $L[j]$ is the tectal ephrin-A profile, the posterior lesion starts at index $J_{\\mathrm{cut}}$ with lesion factor $\\lambda$, the weights are $\\alpha$ for the repulsive interaction and $\\beta$ for the wiring cost, and the misprojection tolerance is $\\tau$.\n\n- Case A (Standard case with posterior lesion):\n  - $N = 10$\n  - $R = [\\,0.10,\\,0.18,\\,0.26,\\,0.34,\\,0.42,\\,0.50,\\,0.60,\\,0.72,\\,0.85,\\,1.00\\,]$\n  - $L = [\\,0.15,\\,0.22,\\,0.29,\\,0.36,\\,0.43,\\,0.50,\\,0.60,\\,0.72,\\,0.85,\\,1.00\\,]$\n  - $J_{\\mathrm{cut}} = 6$\n  - $\\lambda = 0.20$\n  - $\\alpha = 1.00$\n  - $\\beta = 0.10$\n  - $\\tau = 2$\n- Case B (no lesion boundary condition):\n  - $N = 10$\n  - $R = [\\,0.10,\\,0.18,\\,0.26,\\,0.34,\\,0.42,\\,0.50,\\,0.60,\\,0.72,\\,0.85,\\,1.00\\,]$\n  - $L = [\\,0.15,\\,0.22,\\,0.29,\\,0.36,\\,0.43,\\,0.50,\\,0.60,\\,0.72,\\,0.85,\\,1.00\\,]$\n  - $J_{\\mathrm{cut}} = 6$\n  - $\\lambda = 1.00$\n  - $\\alpha = 1.00$\n  - $\\beta = 0.10$\n  - $\\tau = 2$\n- Case C (small $N$ with severe lesion and non-uniform $R$):\n  - $N = 6$\n  - $R = [\\,0.20,\\,0.27,\\,0.33,\\,0.60,\\,0.75,\\,0.90\\,]$\n  - $L = [\\,0.12,\\,0.20,\\,0.35,\\,0.48,\\,0.70,\\,0.95\\,]$\n  - $J_{\\mathrm{cut}} = 3$\n  - $\\lambda = 0.00$\n  - $\\alpha = 1.00$\n  - $\\beta = 0.15$\n  - $\\tau = 1$\n\nProgram requirements:\n\n- Construct the lesioned ligand profile $L^{\\prime}[j]$ by setting $L^{\\prime}[j] = L[j]$ for $j  J_{\\mathrm{cut}}$ and $L^{\\prime}[j] = \\lambda \\cdot L[j]$ for $j \\ge J_{\\mathrm{cut}}$.\n- Define a pairwise cost consistent with the principles above and solve the bijective assignment that minimizes the total cost over all retinal–tectal pairs.\n- Detect misprojection zones as described and represent them as inclusive integer index intervals.\n- Final Output Format: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element corresponds to one test case and is itself a list of two-element integer lists. No other text should be printed. For example, an output for three cases might look like $[[[0,2],[5,7]],[],[[3,5]]]$.\n\nYour program must output exactly one line containing the list of results for Case A, Case B, and Case C in that order.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a simplified but standard model of axon guidance in the retinotectal system, based on the established principles of chemoaffinity repulsion (mediated by EphA/ephrin-A gradients) and a topographic wiring cost. The problem is fully specified with all necessary parameters and definitions, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. It is a valid computational neuroscience problem.\n\nThe solution involves constructing a cost matrix based on the provided principles and then solving the linear assignment problem to find the globally optimal mapping of retinal axons to tectal targets that minimizes total energy.\n\n**1. Model Formalization**\n\nThe system consists of $N$ retinal sites, indexed by $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$, and $N$ tectal sites, indexed by $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$. The retinal EphA receptor expression profile is given by the array $R[i]$, and the unperturbed tectal ephrin-A ligand profile is given by $L[j]$.\n\nA partial posterior lesion is applied to the tectum. The resulting lesioned ligand profile, $L'[j]$, is defined as:\n$$\nL'[j] = \\begin{cases}\nL[j]  \\text{if } j  J_{\\mathrm{cut}} \\\\\n\\lambda \\cdot L[j]  \\text{if } j \\ge J_{\\mathrm{cut}}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $J_{\\mathrm{cut}}$ is the starting index of the lesion and $\\lambda$ is the lesion factor.\n\nThe model incorporates two energy components for a potential connection between retinal axon $i$ and tectal target $j$:\n\n- **Chemoaffinity Cost ($E_{\\text{chemo}}$)**: This term represents the repulsive interaction between the EphA receptor and the ephrin-A ligand. It is proportional to the product of their expression levels, weighted by a factor $\\alpha$.\n$$ E_{\\text{chemo}}(i, j) = \\alpha \\cdot R[i] \\cdot L'[j] $$\n\n- **Wiring Cost ($E_{\\text{wire}}$)**: This term imposes a penalty for deviations from the baseline topographic mapping. The normative mapping for the retina's nasal-to-temporal axis (increasing $i$) to the tectum's anterior-to-posterior axis (increasing $j$) is inverted: high EphA temporal axons map to the low ephrin-A anterior tectum. The baseline target $j_{0,i}$ for a retinal axon $i$ is thus $j_{0,i} = (N-1) - i$. The wiring cost is a quadratic penalty for deviations from this baseline, weighted by a factor $\\beta$.\n$$ E_{\\text{wire}}(i, j) = \\beta \\cdot (j - j_{0,i})^2 = \\beta \\cdot (j - ((N-1) - i))^2 $$\n\nThe total cost $C_{ij}$ for assigning axon $i$ to target $j$ is the sum of these two components:\n$$ C_{ij} = E_{\\text{chemo}}(i, j) + E_{\\text{wire}}(i, j) = \\alpha \\cdot R[i] \\cdot L'[j] + \\beta \\cdot (j - (N-1) + i)^2 $$\nThis defines an $N \\times N$ cost matrix $C$.\n\n**2. Solving for the Optimal Mapping**\n\nThe problem requires finding a bijective (one-to-one) mapping from retinal axons to tectal sites. Such a mapping can be represented by a permutation $\\pi$ of the tectal indices, where $\\pi(i)$ is the tectal target assigned to retinal axon $i$. The total energy of a given mapping $\\pi$ is the sum of the costs of all individual connections:\n$$ E(\\pi) = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} C_{i, \\pi(i)} $$\nThe goal is to find the optimal permutation $\\pi^*$ that minimizes this total energy. This is a classic linear assignment problem. It can be solved efficiently by algorithms such as the Hungarian algorithm or using available numerical solvers. We will use `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment` which provides an efficient implementation. This function takes the cost matrix $C$ as input and returns the set of pairs $(i, j)$ that form the minimal-cost assignment.\n\n**3. Identifying Misprojection Zones**\n\nOnce the optimal mapping $\\pi^*$ is found, we identify misprojecting axons. For each axon $i$, its assigned target is $j^* = \\pi^*(i)$. Its baseline topographic target is $j_{0,i} = (N-1) - i$. A misprojection is recorded at the tectal site $j^*$ if the mapping deviation $|j^* - j_{0,i}|$ meets or exceeds a given integer tolerance $\\tau$:\n$$ |j^* - j_{0,i}| \\ge \\tau $$\nWe can construct a boolean array, `is_misprojected`, of size $N$, marking each tectal site $j$ as `True` if it is the target of a misprojecting axon, and `False` otherwise.\n\nFinally, we scan this boolean array to identify all maximal contiguous intervals of `True` values. Each such interval $[j_{\\mathrm{start}}, j_{\\mathrm{end}}]$ represents a misprojection zone. The final output for each test case is a list of these intervals. If no sites are flagged as misprojected, the output is an empty list.\n\nThis procedure is deterministic and will be applied to each test case provided.\n- **Case A**: A significant lesion ($\\lambda = 0.20$) is expected to reduce ephrin-A levels in the posterior tectum, making it an attractive target even for high-EphA temporal axons, potentially causing re-routing and misprojections around the lesion boundary.\n- **Case B**: With $\\lambda = 1.00$, there is no lesion. Both the chemoaffinity and wiring cost terms are minimized by the baseline mapping $j = (N-1) - i$. Therefore, the optimal mapping will be the baseline mapping, resulting in zero deviation for all axons and thus no misprojections.\n- **Case C**: A severe lesion ($\\lambda = 0.00$) completely removes the ligand from the posterior tectum. This creates a highly attractive region where the chemoaffinity cost is zero. The low-EphA axons will map to the zero-ephrin posterior sites, while the high-EphA axons are forced into the high-ephrin anterior sites. With the specific parameters of this case, it is plausible that this re-assignment occurs in an orderly fashion that respects the baseline topography sufficiently, leading to no misprojections that meet the tolerance criterion. The implementation will determine the precise outcome.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import linear_sum_assignment\nimport json\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the axon guidance problem for the given test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A (Standard case with posterior lesion)\n        {\n            \"N\": 10,\n            \"R\": [0.10, 0.18, 0.26, 0.34, 0.42, 0.50, 0.60, 0.72, 0.85, 1.00],\n            \"L\": [0.15, 0.22, 0.29, 0.36, 0.43, 0.50, 0.60, 0.72, 0.85, 1.00],\n            \"J_cut\": 6,\n            \"lambda\": 0.20,\n            \"alpha\": 1.00,\n            \"beta\": 0.10,\n            \"tau\": 2\n        },\n        # Case B (no lesion boundary condition)\n        {\n            \"N\": 10,\n            \"R\": [0.10, 0.18, 0.26, 0.34, 0.42, 0.50, 0.60, 0.72, 0.85, 1.00],\n            \"L\": [0.15, 0.22, 0.29, 0.36, 0.43, 0.50, 0.60, 0.72, 0.85, 1.00],\n            \"J_cut\": 6,\n            \"lambda\": 1.00,\n            \"alpha\": 1.00,\n            \"beta\": 0.10,\n            \"tau\": 2\n        },\n        # Case C (small N with severe lesion and non-uniform R)\n        {\n            \"N\": 6,\n            \"R\": [0.20, 0.27, 0.33, 0.60, 0.75, 0.90],\n            \"L\": [0.12, 0.20, 0.35, 0.48, 0.70, 0.95],\n            \"J_cut\": 3,\n            \"lambda\": 0.00,\n            \"alpha\": 1.00,\n            \"beta\": 0.15,\n            \"tau\": 1\n        }\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        N = case[\"N\"]\n        R = np.array(case[\"R\"])\n        L = np.array(case[\"L\"])\n        J_cut = case[\"J_cut\"]\n        lambda_lesion = case[\"lambda\"]\n        alpha = case[\"alpha\"]\n        beta = case[\"beta\"]\n        tau = case[\"tau\"]\n\n        # Step 1: Construct the lesioned ligand profile L'\n        L_prime = np.copy(L)\n        L_prime[J_cut:] *= lambda_lesion\n\n        # Step 2: Construct the N x N cost matrix\n        cost_matrix = np.zeros((N, N))\n        for i in range(N):  # retinal index\n            for j in range(N):  # tectal index\n                # Baseline topographic target for retinal axon i\n                j0_i = (N - 1) - i\n                \n                # Chemoaffinity cost\n                chemo_cost = alpha * R[i] * L_prime[j]\n                \n                # Wiring cost (quadratic penalty)\n                wiring_cost = beta * ((j - j0_i) ** 2)\n                \n                cost_matrix[i, j] = chemo_cost + wiring_cost\n\n        # Step 3: Solve the linear assignment problem\n        row_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(cost_matrix)\n        \n        # The result `col_ind` gives the optimal tectal target for each retinal axon `row_ind`.\n        # We create a mapping array where `mapping[i]` is the target for axon `i`.\n        # `row_ind` is guaranteed to be [0, 1, ..., N-1] if the cost matrix is square.\n        mapping = np.zeros(N, dtype=int)\n        mapping[row_ind] = col_ind\n\n        # Step 4: Identify misprojected tectal sites\n        is_misprojected = np.zeros(N, dtype=bool)\n        for i in range(N):\n            j_assigned = mapping[i]\n            j_baseline = (N - 1) - i\n            deviation = abs(j_assigned - j_baseline)\n            if deviation >= tau:\n                is_misprojected[j_assigned] = True\n\n        # Step 5: Group misprojected sites into maximal contiguous intervals\n        misprojection_intervals = []\n        in_interval = False\n        start_interval = -1\n        for j in range(N):\n            if is_misprojected[j] and not in_interval:\n                in_interval = True\n                start_interval = j\n            elif not is_misprojected[j] and in_interval:\n                in_interval = False\n                misprojection_intervals.append([start_interval, j - 1])\n        \n        if in_interval:\n            misprojection_intervals.append([start_interval, N - 1])\n            \n        results.append(misprojection_intervals)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # Using json.dumps with separators to avoid spaces for a compact representation.\n    print(json.dumps(results, separators=(',', ':')))\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "4452606"}]}
