The data are consistent, with the standard population weights summing to $1$. The problem is a direct application of core principles to a realistic scenario in global health.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the general expression for the direct age-standardized rate.\n\nThe objective of direct age standardization is to compute a summary incidence rate for a population of interest that reflects the rate that would be observed if that population had the age structure of a specified standard population. This removes the confounding effect of age when comparing rates between populations with different age distributions.\n\nLet a population be stratified into $k$ age groups, indexed by $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, k$.\nThe age-specific incidence rate, $r_i$, for age group $i$ is defined as the number of new cases, $c_i$, occurring in that age group over a period, divided by the total person-time at risk, $p_i$, for that same group and period.\n$$r_i = \\frac{c_i}{p_i}$$\nThis rate is typically expressed per a standard population unit, such as $100{,}000$ person-years.\n\nA standard population is also stratified into the same $k$ age groups. Let $N_{std,i}$ be the number of individuals (or person-years) in the $i$-th age group of the standard population. The total size of the standard population is $N_{std} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} N_{std,i}$. The proportion of the standard population in age group $i$, denoted by the weight $w_i$, is:\n$$w_i = \\frac{N_{std,i}}{N_{std}}$$\nBy definition, the sum of these weights is unity: $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i = 1$.\n\nTo find the age-standardized rate (ASR), we apply the observed age-specific rates, $r_i$, from our study population to the corresponding age strata of the standard population. This gives the *expected* number of cases, $c_{exp,i}$, that would occur in each age stratum of the standard population:\n$$c_{exp,i} = r_i \\times N_{std,i}$$\nThe total expected number of cases in the standard population, $C_{exp}$, is the sum of the expected cases across all age strata:\n$$C_{exp} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} c_{exp,i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} (r_i \\times N_{std,i})$$\nThe ASR is then defined as this total number of expected cases divided by the total size of the standard population, $N_{std}$:\n$$ASR = \\frac{C_{exp}}{N_{std}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} (r_i \\times N_{std,i})}{N_{std}}$$\nBy distributing the denominator, we can express the ASR in terms of the standard population weights, $w_i$:\n$$ASR = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} r_i \\left( \\frac{N_{std,i}}{N_{std}} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} r_i w_i$$\nThis is the general expression for the direct age-standardized rate. It is a weighted average of the age-specific rates, where the weights are the proportions of the respective age groups in the standard population.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the standardized incidence rates.\n\nThe problem provides data for $k=5$ age bands. The standard population weights are $w_{1} = 0.26$, $w_{2} = 0.43$, $w_{3} = 0.20$, $w_{4} = 0.06$, and $w_{5} = 0.05$. All rates are given in cases per $100{,}000$ person-years.\n\nFor Region L, the age-specific rates are $r_{L,1} = 3$, $r_{L,2} = 35$, $r_{L,3} = 260$, $r_{L,4} = 780$, and $r_{L,5} = 1650$.\nThe age-standardized rate for Region L, $ASR_{L}$, is:\n$$ASR_{L} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} r_{L,i} w_i = (3)(0.26) + (35)(0.43) + (260)(0.20) + (780)(0.06) + (1650)(0.05)$$\n$$ASR_{L} = 0.78 + 15.05 + 52.0 + 46.8 + 82.5 = 197.13$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $ASR_{L} = 197.1$ cases per $100{,}000$ person-years.\n\nFor Region H, the age-specific rates are $r_{H,1} = 2$, $r_{H,2} = 25$, $r_{H,3} = 220$, $r_{H,4} = 650$, and $r_{H,5} = 1400$.\nThe age-standardized rate for Region H, $ASR_{H}$, is:\n$$ASR_{H} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} r_{H,i} w_i = (2)(0.26) + (25)(0.43) + (220)(0.20) + (650)(0.06) + (1400)(0.05)$$\n$$ASR_{H} = 0.52 + 10.75 + 44.0 + 39.0 + 70.0 = 164.27$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $ASR_{H} = 164.3$ cases per $100{,}000$ person-years.\n\nPart 3: Key assumptions for the validity of the direct standardization approach.\n\nThe validity of comparing directly standardized rates rests on several critical assumptions, particularly in the context of global health disparities.\n\n1.  **Comparability of Age-Specific Rates:** The foremost assumption is that the age-specific rates ($r_i$) are accurately measured and are comparable between Region L and Region H. This requires that the definition of an ischemic stroke case, the methods of case ascertainment (e.g., diagnostic technology, hospital reporting systems), and the completeness of data collection are uniform across both regions. In a global health context, disparities in healthcare access and infrastructure can lead to systematic under-diagnosis or misclassification in lower-income settings, potentially violating this assumption and biasing the comparison.\n\n2.  **Appropriateness of the Standard Population:** The choice of the standard population is crucial. The resulting standardized rates are synthetic figures whose absolute values and the magnitude of their difference depend on the chosen standard. The comparison between Region L and H is valid *relative to this specific standard population*. If the standard population's age structure is drastically different from both study populations, the resulting standardized rates may not be biologically or demographically meaningful.\n\n3.  **Absence of Uncontrolled Confounding:** Direct standardization controls for confounding by age. It assumes that there are no other major confounders that are distributed differently between the populations and are also associated with the outcome, or that if they exist, their distribution is similar within each age stratum across the two regions. For stroke, risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and diet are also critical. If the prevalence of these factors differs between Region L and Region H *within the same age-groups*, age-standardization alone is insufficient to provide a completely unbiased comparison of risk. For instance, if hypertension is more prevalent and less controlled in the $45$–$64$ age group in Region L than in Region H, this could explain some of the rate difference that is not accounted for by simply standardizing for age.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n197.1  164.3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4482885"}, {"introduction": "After mastering the mechanics of age-standardization, it is crucial to think critically about its application.

Consider cerebrovascular disease (stroke) incidence in two regions: a lower-income region denoted as $L$, and a higher-income region denoted as $H$. The Age-Standardized Rate (ASR) is computed using direct standardization, defined by the foundational rule that the standardized rate equals the sum over age strata of the age-specific rates weighted by the age distribution of a chosen standard population.
