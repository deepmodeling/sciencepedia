All necessary information is provided for a unique solution.\n\nThe transport of the neurotoxicant is described by passive diffusion under steady-state conditions. We begin with Fick's first law of diffusion in one dimension. Let the $x$-axis be perpendicular to the planar barrier. The areal molar flux density, $j$, is proportional to the concentration gradient, $\\frac{dC_m}{dx}$, within the membrane:\n$$ j = -D_m \\frac{dC_m}{dx} $$\nwhere $D_m$ is the diffusion coefficient of the toxicant within the membrane material, and $C_m(x)$ is the concentration of the toxicant within the membrane at position $x$. This equation directly relates the flux density $j$ to the concentration gradient, fulfilling the first part of the problem.\n\nUnder steady-state conditions, the flux $j$ must be constant with respect to position $x$.
