The language is objective and precise, and the parameters given are plausible within a clinical context. The problem is internally consistent and does not violate any scientific or logical principles.\n\nThe solution will be derived by first calculating the expected harm per inappropriate surgery, then using this value to find the total expected harm for each policy across the entire cohort, and finally determining the difference in harm between the two policies.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of patients in the cohort with PNES, denoted by $N_{\\text{PNES}}$. Based on the given total cohort size $N = 1,000$ and the base rate of PNES $p = 0.15$, this number is:\n$$N_{\\text{PNES}} = N \\times p = 1,000 \\times 0.15 = 150$$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected harm in QALYs lost for a single PNES patient who undergoes inappropriate surgery.
