It is scientifically grounded in probability theory and its application to clinical diagnostics. The setup is self-contained; it provides all necessary prior probabilities and conditional probabilities (likelihoods). The sum of the prior probabilities is $0.30 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.20 = 1.00$, which is consistent. The problem states the assumption of conditional independence, which is necessary to make the problem tractable. The question is objective, well-posed, and asks for a specific, computable set of posterior probabilities. The terminology is standard for clinical-statistical modeling. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or missing data.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be computed.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the posterior probability of each etiologic category $H_i$ given the combined evidence $E$. This is denoted $P(H_i|E)$. According to Bayes' theorem, this is given by:\n$$P(H_i|E) = \\frac{P(E|H_i)P(H_i)}{P(E)}$$\nwhere $P(H_i)$ is the prior probability of hypothesis $H_i$, $P(E|H_i)$ is the likelihood of observing evidence $E$ given $H_i$, and $P(E)$ is the marginal probability of the evidence, which acts as a normalization constant.\n\nThe evidence $E$ is the conjunction of four independent features, $E = E_1 \\cap E_2 \\cap E_3 \\cap E_4$. The assumption of conditional independence means that the likelihood $P(E|H_i)$ can be calculated as the product of the individual conditional probabilities:\n$$P(E|H_i) = P(E_1|H_i) \\times P(E_2|H_i) \\times P(E_3|H_i) \\times P(E_4|H_i)$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the joint likelihood $P(E|H_i)$ for each of the four hypotheses.\nFor Prion disease ($H_{Pr}$):\n$$P(E|H_{Pr}) = P(E_1|H_{Pr})P(E_2|H_{Pr})P(E_3|H_{Pr})P(E_4|H_{Pr}) = (0.50)(0.05)(0.80)(0.60) = 0.012$$\nFor Autoimmune encephalitis ($H_{AE}$):\n$$P(E|H_{AE}) = P(E_1|H_{AE})P(E_2|H_{AE})P(E_3|H_{AE})P(E_4|H_{AE}) = (0.25)(0.30)(0.60)(0.55) = 0.02475$$\nFor Infectious encephalitis ($H_{IE}$):\n$$P(E|H_{IE}) = P(E_1|H_{IE})P(E_2|H_{IE})P(E_3|H_{IE})P(E_4|H_{IE}) = (0.20)(0.10)(0.30)(0.40) = 0.0024$$\nFor Metabolic/toxic encephalopathy ($H_{MT}$):\n$$P(E|H_{MT}) = P(E_1|H_{MT})P(E_2|H_{MT})P(E_3|H_{MT})P(E_4|H_{MT}) = (0.30)(0.05)(0.50)(0.35) = 0.002625$$\n\nNext, we calculate the numerator of Bayes' theorem, $P(E|H_i)P(H_i)$, for each hypothesis.\nFor $H_{Pr}$:\n$$P(E|H_{Pr})P(H_{Pr}) = (0.012)(0.30) = 0.0036$$\nFor $H_{AE}$:\n$$P(E|H_{AE})P(H_{AE}) = (0.02475)(0.25) = 0.0061875$$\nFor $H_{IE}$:\n$$P(E|H_{IE})P(H_{IE}) = (0.0024)(0.25) = 0.0006$$\nFor $H_{MT}$:\n$$P(E|H_{MT})P(H_{MT}) = (0.002625)(0.20) = 0.000525$$\n\nThe denominator $P(E)$ is the sum of these values over all hypotheses, according to the law of total probability:\n$$P(E) = \\sum_i P(E|H_i)P(H_i)$$\n$$P(E) = 0.0036 + 0.0061875 + 0.0006 + 0.000525 = 0.0109125$$\n\nFinally, we find the posterior probability for each hypothesis by dividing its numerator by the normalization constant $P(E)$.\nPosterior probability of Prion disease:\n$$P(H_{Pr}|E) = \\frac{0.0036}{0.0109125} \\approx 0.3298969...$$\nPosterior probability of Autoimmune encephalitis:\n$$P(H_{AE}|E) = \\frac{0.0061875}{0.0109125} \\approx 0.5670103...$$\nPosterior probability of Infectious encephalitis:\n$$P(H_{IE}|E) = \\frac{0.0006}{0.0109125} \\approx 0.0549806...$$\nPosterior probability of Metabolic/toxic encephalopathy:\n$$P(H_{MT}|E) = \\frac{0.000525}{0.0109125} \\approx 0.0481121...$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding each probability to four significant figures.\n$P(H_{Pr}|E) \\approx 0.3299$\n$P(H_{AE}|E) \\approx 0.5670$\n$P(H_{IE}|E) \\approx 0.05498$\n$P(H_{MT}|E) \\approx 0.04811$\n\nThe final answer is a row vector of these probabilities in the specified order: [prion, autoimmune, infectious, metabolic].", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.3299 & 0.5670 & 0.05498 & 0.04811\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4520639"}, {"introduction": "Once an initial differential diagnosis is formed, clinicians turn to specific tests to refine their hypotheses.
