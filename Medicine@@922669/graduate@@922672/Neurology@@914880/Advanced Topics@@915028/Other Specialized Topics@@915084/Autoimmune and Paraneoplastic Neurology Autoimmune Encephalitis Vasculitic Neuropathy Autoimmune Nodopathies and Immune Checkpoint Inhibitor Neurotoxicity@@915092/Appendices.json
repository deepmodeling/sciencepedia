It is a well-posed and scientifically grounded application of Bayesian probability to clinical diagnostics, providing all necessary information without contradiction.\n\nLet us define the relevant events for this analysis:\n$D$: The event that the patient has an underlying breast or ovarian carcinoma (the \"disease\").\n$D^c$: The event that the patient does not have an underlying breast or ovarian carcinoma.\n$T$: The event that the patient's anti-Yo antibody test result is positive.\n$T^c$: The event that the patient's anti-Yo antibody test result is negative.\n\nThe information provided in the problem statement can be translated into the language of probability as follows:\nThe pretest probability, or prevalence, of the disease is given as $P(D) = 0.10$.\nFrom this, the probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\nThe sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease. This is given as $P(T|D) = 0.70$.\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease. This is given as $P(T^c|D^c) = 0.98$.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the positive predictive value (PPV) and compute its value. The PPV is defined as the probability that the patient has the disease given that the test result is positive, which is the conditional probability $P(D|T)$.\n\nWe begin the derivation from fundamental principles, as requested. Bayes' rule provides the formal relationship between $P(D|T)$ and $P(T|D)$:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(T)} $$\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T)$, is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. Using the definition of conditional probability, $P(T|D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(D)}$, we can express the numerator as:\n$$ P(D \\cap T) = P(T|D) \\times P(D) $$\nThis term represents the probability of a true positive result.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, is the overall probability of receiving a positive test result, regardless of the patient's actual disease status. We can expand this term using the law of total probability. A positive test result can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: ($1$) the patient has the disease and tests positive, or ($2$) the patient does not have the disease and tests positive. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ P(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap D^c) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term, we get:\n$$ P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c) $$\nThe first term, $P(T|D)P(D)$, is the probability of a true positive. The second term, $P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$, is the probability of a false positive.\n\nWe have an expression for $P(T|D^c)$? No, but we have the specificity, $P(T^c|D^c)$. The event of a positive test in a disease-free individual, $P(T|D^c)$, and the event of a negative test in a disease-free individual, $P(T^c|D^c)$, are complementary. Therefore:\n$$ P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) $$\nThis quantity, $P(T|D^c)$, is also known as the false positive rate.\n\nSubstituting all these components back into the expression for $P(D|T)$ yields the complete form of Bayes' rule for this problem:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)} $$\nThis is the derived expression for the positive predictive value. We can also express this in terms of sensitivity ($S_e = P(T|D)$), specificity ($S_p = P(T^c|D^c)$), and prevalence ($p = P(D)$):\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D|T) = \\frac{S_e \\times p}{S_e \\times p + (1 - S_p) \\times (1 - p)} $$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the given data:\n$p = P(D) = 0.10$\n$S_e = P(T|D) = 0.70$\n$S_p = P(T^c|D^c) = 0.98$\n\nFirst, we calculate the required probabilities:\n$P(D^c) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$\n$P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived formula for PPV:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{0.70 \\times 0.10}{(0.70 \\times 0.10) + (0.02 \\times 0.90)} $$\nLet's calculate the numerator and the two terms in the denominator:\nNumerator (probability of true positives):\n$$ P(T|D)P(D) = 0.70 \\times 0.10 = 0.07 $$\nDenominator term $1$ (probability of true positives):\n$$ 0.07 $$\nDenominator term $2$ (probability of false positives):\n$$ P(T|D^c)P(D^c) = 0.02 \\times 0.90 = 0.018 $$\nTotal probability of a positive test:\n$$ P(T) = 0.07 + 0.018 = 0.088 $$\nThe positive predictive value is the ratio of the true positive probability to the total probability of a positive test:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{0.07}{0.088} $$\nTo express this as a fraction in simplest terms, we can write:\n$$ \\frac{0.07}{0.088} = \\frac{70}{880} = \\frac{7}{88} $$\nWait, the original solution had a different fraction. Let me re-check its calculation.\n`\\frac{0.07}{0.088} = \\frac{70}{88}`. This is where I got confused before, but let's re-verify: `0.07 / 0.088 = (7/100) / (88/1000) = (7/100) * (1000/88) = 7 * 10 / 88 = 70/88`. The original calculation was correct.\nSo, `70/88` it is.\nThe greatest common divisor of $70$ and $88$ is $2$. Dividing the numerator and denominator by $2$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{70 \\div 2}{88 \\div 2} = \\frac{35}{44} $$\nThe prime factors of $35$ are $5$ and $7$. The prime factors of $44$ are $2^2$ and $11$.

Derivation of the Positive Predictive Value ($PPV_{++}$)**\n\nThe positive predictive value of the sequential algorithm for a patient who tests positive on both assays is defined as the probability that the patient has the disease given two positive test results, $PPV_{++} = P(D \\mid T_1+, T_2+)$.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem, we can write this as:\n$$PPV_{++} = \\frac{P(T_1+, T_2+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T_1+, T_2+)}$$\n\nThe numerator represents the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive on both assays. Using the conditional independence assumption:\n$$P(T_1+, T_2+ \\mid D) P(D) = P(T_1+ \\mid D) P(T_2+ \\mid D) P(D) = Se_1 Se_2 p$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T_1+, T_2+)$, is the total probability of obtaining two positive tests. We can expand this using the law of total probability, conditioning on the disease state $D$:\n$$P(T_1+, T_2+) = P(T_1+, T_2+ \\mid D)P(D) + P(T_1+, T_2+ \\mid \\neg D)P(\\neg D)$$\n\nThe first term is the numerator we just found. The second term represents the joint probability of not having the disease and testing positive on both assays (a false positive result for the sequence). Applying the conditional independence assumption again:\n$$P(T_1+, T_2+ \\mid \\neg D)P(\\neg D) = P(T_1+ \\mid \\neg D)P(T_2+ \\mid \\neg D)P(\\neg D) = (1-Sp_1)(1-Sp_2)(1-p)$$\n\nCombining these terms, the denominator becomes:\n$$P(T_1+, T_2+) = Se_1 Se_2 p + (1-Sp_1)(1-Sp_2)(1-p)$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into the formula for $PPV_{++}$, we arrive at the final derived expression:\n$$PPV_{++} = \\frac{Se_1 Se_2 p}{Se_1 Se_2 p + (1-Sp_1)(1-Sp_2)(1-p)}$$\nThis completes the first task.\n\n**2. Justification for Reduced False Discovery and Numerical Calculation**\n\nA false discovery in this context is a false-positive result. The sequential algorithm reduces false discoveries by significantly lowering the probability of a false-positive outcome compared to the screening test alone.\n\nLet us compare the PPV of the screening test alone, $PPV_1 = P(D \\mid T_1+)$, with $PPV_{++}$. The formula for $PPV_1$ is:\n$$PPV_1 = \\frac{P(T_1+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T_1+)} = \\frac{Se_1 p}{Se_1 p + (1-Sp_1)(1-p)}$$\n\nThe probability of a true-positive result for the single test is $P(\\text{TP}_1) = Se_1 p$. For the sequential test, this probability is $P(\\text{TP}_{++}) = Se_1 Se_2 p$. The number of true positives is reduced by a factor of $Se_2 = 0.88$.\n\nThe probability of a false-positive result for the single test is $P(\\text{FP}_1) = (1-Sp_1)(1-p)$. For the sequential test, this probability is $P(\\text{FP}_{++}) = (1-Sp_1)(1-Sp_2)(1-p)$. The number of false positives is reduced by a factor of $(1-Sp_2) = 0.01$.\n\nThe key to reducing false discovery is that the probability of a false-positive result is reduced far more dramatically than the probability of a true-positive result. The ratio of the scaling factors is $\\frac{1-Sp_2}{Se_2} = \\frac{0.01}{0.88} \\approx 0.011$. This indicates that the false-positive component of the total positive results is diminished by nearly two orders of magnitude relative to the true-positive component. The requirement for a second positive test acts as a highly effective filter, removing a large majority ($99\\%$) of the false positives generated by the initial, less specific screen, while retaining a large fraction ($88\\%$) of the true positives. This disproportionate reduction of false positives leads to a substantial increase in the post-test probability of disease (PPV) and thus a reduction in the false discovery rate ($1 - PPV$).\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $PPV_{++}$ using the provided parameters: $p=0.04$, $Se_1=0.92$, $Sp_1=0.95$, $Se_2=0.88$, and $Sp_2=0.99$.\n\nNumerator:\n$$Se_1 Se_2 p = (0.92)(0.88)(0.04) = 0.8096 \\times 0.04 = 0.032384$$\n\nDenominator (false positive term):\n$$(1-Sp_1)(1-Sp_2)(1-p) = (1-0.95)(1-0.99)(1-0.04) = (0.05)(0.01)(0.96) = 0.00048$$\n\nTotal Denominator:\n$$0.032384 + 0.00048 = 0.032864$$\n\nFinally, we calculate $PPV_{++}$:\n$$PPV_{++} = \\frac{0.032384}{0.032864} \\approx 0.98539435...$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the positive predictive value for a patient testing positive on both assays is $0.9854$.\nFor comparison, the PPV of the screening test alone would be:\n$$PPV_1 = \\frac{(0.92)(0.04)}{(0.92)(0.04) + (0.05)(0.96)} = \\frac{0.0368}{0.0368 + 0.048} = \\frac{0.0368}{0.0848} \\approx 0.4340$$\nThe sequential testing algorithm increases the PPV from approximately $43.4\\%$ to $98.5\\%$, a clear demonstration of the reduction in false discoveries.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9854}$$", "id": "4451066"}, {"introduction": "Diagnostic uncertainty arises not only from the biochemical properties of a test but also from the physical process of sampling.

It is a formalizable problem in geometric probability directly relevant to the specified medical context.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete and reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Detection Probability\nThe clinical observation that NSVN is characterized by focal, segmental inflammation with \"skip lesions\" implies that the disease process is not continuous along the nerve. A biopsy, which samples a small segment of the nerve, might be taken from a location between these diseased foci. This would result in a histologically normal sample, leading to a false-negative diagnosis, even though the patient has the disease. The following derivation quantifies the probability of avoiding such a sampling error.\n\nThe problem is to find the probability that a randomly placed segment of length $L$ intersects at least one of a set of randomly placed intervals of length $\\ell$. The centers of the intervals of length $\\ell$ (the vasculitic foci) are distributed along the real line according to a homogeneous Poisson point process with rate $\\nu$.\n\nLet the biopsy segment be denoted by $S$. Due to the homogeneity of the Poisson process (statistical invariance under translation), we can fix the position of the biopsy segment without loss of generality. Let us place the biopsy segment at the interval $S = [0, L]$.\n\nA vasculitic focus is an interval of length $\\ell$. Let a particular focus, $F_i$, be centered at the point $x_i$. This focus corresponds to the interval $F_i = [x_i - \\frac{\\ell}{2}, x_i + \\frac{\\ell}{2}]$. The set of centers $\\{x_i\\}$ constitutes the points of the Poisson process.\n\nDetection occurs if the biopsy segment $S$ and at least one focus $F_i$ have a non-empty intersection, i.e., $S \\cap F_i \\neq \\emptyset$. It is more tractable to calculate the probability of the complementary event: no detection. This event occurs if the biopsy segment $S$ does not intersect *any* of the foci, i.e., $S \\cap F_i = \\emptyset$ for all $i$.\n\nThe probability of detection is then given by:\n$$P(\\text{detection}) = 1 - P(\\text{no detection})$$\n\nLet's determine the condition on a focus center $x_i$ such that its corresponding focus $F_i$ intersects the biopsy segment $S = [0, L]$. The two intervals $F_i = [x_i - \\frac{\\ell}{2}, x_i + \\frac{\\ell}{2}]$ and $S = [0, L]$ intersect if and only if $F_i$ is not entirely to the right of $S$ AND $F_i$ is not entirely to the left of $S$.\n1.  $F_i$ is not entirely to the right of $S$: The left endpoint of $F_i$ must be less than or equal to the right endpoint of $S$. This means $x_i - \\frac{\\ell}{2} \\le L$, which implies $x_i \\le L + \\frac{\\ell}{2}$.\n2.  $F_i$ is not entirely to the left of $S$: The right endpoint of $F_i$ must be greater than or equal to the left endpoint of $S$. This means $x_i + \\frac{\\ell}{2} \\ge 0$, which implies $x_i \\ge -\\frac{\\ell}{2}$.\n\nCombining these two conditions, a focus centered at $x_i$ intersects the biopsy segment $S=[0, L]$ if and only if its center $x_i$ lies within the closed interval $\\left[-\\frac{\\ell}{2}, L + \\frac{\\ell}{2}\\right]$. Let us call this the \"critical region\".\n\nThe length of this critical region is $\\left(L + \\frac{\\ell}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\ell}{2}\\right) = L + \\ell$.\n\nThe event of \"no detection\" is equivalent to the event that there are zero focus centers $\\{x_i\\}$ located within this critical region of length $L+\\ell$.\n\nWe now use the core definition of the homogeneous Poisson point process. The number of points, $N$, occurring in any interval of length $x$ is a random variable following a Poisson distribution with mean parameter $\\lambda = \\nu x$. The probability mass function is $P(N=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$.\n\nFor our problem, we are interested in the number of focus centers in the critical region, an interval of length $L+\\ell$. Let $N_{crit}$ be the number of focus centers in this interval. $N_{crit}$ is a Poisson-distributed random variable with mean parameter:\n$$\\lambda = \\nu (L + \\ell)$$\n\nThe probability of no detection is the probability that $N_{crit} = 0$. Using the Poisson probability mass function with $k=0$:\n$$P(\\text{no detection}) = P(N_{crit} = 0) = \\frac{(\\nu(L+\\ell))^0 \\exp(-\\nu(L+\\ell))}{0!}$$\n\nGiven that $z^0 = 1$ for any non-zero $z$ and $0! = 1$, this expression simplifies to:\n$$P(\\text{no detection}) = \\exp(-\\nu(L+\\ell))$$\n\nFinally, the probability of detection is the probability of the complementary event:\n$$P(\\text{detection}) = 1 - P(\\text{no detection})$$\n$$P(\\text{detection}) = 1 - \\exp(-\\nu(L+\\ell))$$\n\nThis is the exact, closed-form analytic expression for the probability that a biopsy of length $L$ will detect at least one vasculitic focus of length $\\ell$, where the foci are distributed with an average density of $\\nu$ per unit length.
