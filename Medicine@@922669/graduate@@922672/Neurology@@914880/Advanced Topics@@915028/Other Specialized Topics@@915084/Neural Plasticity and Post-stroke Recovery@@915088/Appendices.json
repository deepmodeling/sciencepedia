This can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\Delta w(\\Delta t) = A_{+} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{+}}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } \\Delta t > 0\n$$\n\nFact (ii) states that for $\\Delta t < 0$, the change is negative (LTD) and its magnitude decays exponentially from an amplitude $A_{-}$. The magnitude of the change is $|\\Delta w| = A_{-} \\exp(-\\frac{|\\Delta t|}{\\tau_{-}})$. Since $\\Delta t < 0$, we have $|\\Delta t| = -\\Delta t$. The change itself is negative, so we write:\n$$\n\\Delta w(\\Delta t) = -A_{-} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|\\Delta t|}{\\tau_{-}}\\right) = -A_{-} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{-}}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } \\Delta t < 0\n$$\n\nCombining these gives the complete piecewise function for a single spike pair:\n$$\n\\Delta w(\\Delta t) =\n\\begin{cases}\nA_{+} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{+}}\\right) & \\text{if } \\Delta t > 0 \\\\\n-A_{-} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{-}}\\right) & \\text{if } \\Delta t < 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe problem specifies two spike pairs and assumes an additive model, where the net change $\\Delta w_{\\mathrm{net}}$ is the sum of the individual changes.\n$$\n\\Delta w_{\\mathrm{net}} = \\Delta w(\\Delta t_1) + \\Delta w(\\Delta t_2)\n$$\n\nWe are given the values for the two spike pairs: $\\Delta t_1 = 10~\\mathrm{ms}$ and $\\Delta t_2 = -20~\\mathrm{ms}$. We are also given the parameters: $A_{+} = 0.004$, $\\tau_{+} = 20~\\mathrm{ms}$, $A_{-} = 0.005$, and $\\tau_{-} = 30~\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the change from the causal pair, $\\Delta w_1 = \\Delta w(\\Delta t_1)$. Since $\\Delta t_1 = 10~\\mathrm{ms} > 0$, we use the LTP rule:\n$$\n\\Delta w_1 = A_{+} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t_1}{\\tau_{+}}\\right) = 0.004 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{10~\\mathrm{ms}}{20~\\mathrm{ms}}\\right) = 0.004 \\exp(-0.5)\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the change from the anti-causal pair, $\\Delta w_2 = \\Delta w(\\Delta t_2)$. Since $\\Delta t_2 = -20~\\mathrm{ms} < 0$, we use the LTD rule:\n$$\n\\Delta w_2 = -A_{-} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta t_2}{\\tau_{-}}\\right) = -0.005 \\exp\\left(\\frac{-20~\\mathrm{ms}}{30~\\mathrm{ms}}\\right) = -0.005 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe net synaptic weight change is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$\n\\Delta w_{\\mathrm{net}} = \\Delta w_1 + \\Delta w_2 = 0.004 \\exp(-0.5) - 0.005 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\exp(-0.5) \\approx 0.60653066\n$$\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right) \\approx 0.51341712\n$$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\n\\Delta w_{\\mathrm{net}} \\approx (0.004 \\times 0.60653066) - (0.005 \\times 0.51341712)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta w_{\\mathrm{net}} \\approx 0.0024261226 - 0.0025670856\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta w_{\\mathrm{net}} \\approx -0.000140963\n$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures. The first significant figure is $1$, followed by $4$, $0$, and $9$. The fifth significant figure is $6$, so we round the fourth one ($9$) up.

The primary outcome was the Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), a clinician-rated scale commonly treated as interval-level for group analyses in neurorehabilitation. Across $n$ participants, the pre-to-post mean change in FMA-UE was $6$ points, and the sample standard deviation of the change scores was $8$ points. In anchor-based clinical interpretability studies, the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) for FMA-UE has been reported to vary by recovery phase; for the purpose of this exercise, take two representative thresholds: $5$ points (chronic stroke) and $7$ points (subacute stroke).\n\nStarting from the first-principles idea that a standardized effect quantifies a mean difference in units of the variability of that difference, derive the standardized mean change effect size appropriate for a within-subject (pre–post) design as the version of Cohen’s $d$ that is based on change scores.

It is scientifically grounded in the fields of neurorehabilitation and biostatistics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its language. It requires the derivation and calculation of a standard statistical measure and a principled interpretation of the result in a clinical context.\n\nThe first task is to derive the formula for the standardized mean change effect size, Cohen’s $d$, for a within-subject (pre–post) design. We begin from the first-principles definition that a standardized effect is a mean difference expressed in units of standard deviation.\n\nIn a pre-post design, data are collected from each of the $n$ participants at two time points, pre-intervention ($X_{pre}$) and post-intervention ($X_{post}$). The change for each participant, $i$, is defined as the difference score:\n$$D_i = X_{post, i} - X_{pre, i}$$\nThe \"mean difference\" is the average of these change scores across the sample:\n$$\\bar{D} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} D_i$$\nThe \"variability of that difference\" is the sample standard deviation of these change scores:\n$$s_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (D_i - \\bar{D})^2}$$\nFollowing the first-principles definition, the standardized mean change is the mean change divided by the standard deviation of the change scores. This variant of Cohen's $d$, sometimes denoted $d_z$ or $d_{avg}$, is given by the formula:\n$$d = \\frac{\\bar{D}}{s_D}$$\nThis is the appropriate effect size for a single-group, pre-post design where the interest lies in the magnitude of the change itself.\n\nThe second task is to compute the value of this effect size for the given dataset. The problem provides the following values from the study cohort:\nThe mean pre-to-post change in FMA-UE, $\\bar{D} = 6$ points.\nThe sample standard deviation of the change scores, $s_D = 8$ points.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$d = \\frac{6}{8}$$\nSimplifying this fraction gives the value of the effect size:\n$$d = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nIn decimal form, this is $0.75$. By conventional standards (e.g., Cohen's guidelines), an effect size of this magnitude is considered large (small $\\approx 0.2$, medium $\\approx 0.5$, large $\\approx 0.8$).\n\nThe third task is to provide a principled argument about the clinical meaningfulness of this change. This requires contrasting the distribution-based measure we just calculated (Cohen's $d$) with the provided anchor-based thresholds (Minimal Clinically Important Difference, MCID).\n\nAn MCID is an anchor-based estimate of the smallest change in an outcome score that a patient would identify as important or beneficial. It provides a benchmark for individual-level clinical relevance. In contrast, Cohen's $d$ is a distribution-based measure that quantifies the size of an average effect relative to the variation within the sample. It speaks to the magnitude and consistency of the effect at the group level. A complete interpretation requires considering both.\n\nThe observed mean change for the group is $\\bar{D} = 6$ points.\n\nCase 1: Chronic Post-Stroke Recovery\nThe MCID for chronic stroke patients is given as $5$ points.\nThe group's average improvement ($\\bar{D} = 6$) exceeds the threshold for what is considered a minimal clinically important improvement for an individual in this population ($\\text{MCID} = 5$). This suggests that, on average, participants experienced a change that they would likely perceive as beneficial. The large effect size ($d = 0.75$) reinforces this conclusion by indicating that the average change of $6$ points is large relative to the inter-patient variability in response. Therefore, for the chronic stroke population, the observed mean change is likely to be clinically meaningful.\n\nCase 2: Subacute Post-Stroke Recovery (Hypothetical Context)\nThe MCID for subacute stroke patients is given as $7$ points.\nIn this context, the group's average improvement ($\\bar{D} = 6$) falls short of the threshold for what is considered a minimal clinically important improvement ($\\text{MCID} = 7$). Even though the statistical effect size remains large ($d = 0.75$), indicating a robust change in distributional terms, the magnitude of this average change does not meet the higher bar for clinical relevance in the subacute phase. This illustrates a crucial distinction: a statistically large and significant effect is not necessarily a clinically meaningful one. The interpretation of clinical meaningfulness is context-dependent and relies on external, anchor-based criteria like the MCID. In this hypothetical subacute scenario, one would conclude that the intervention, while producing a measurable effect, does not, on average, achieve a level of improvement deemed important by patients in that specific recovery phase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$$", "id": "4501776"}]}
