By working through this problem, you will develop a quantitative intuition for the core mechanics that enable or limit axonal advance.", "problem": "Consider a regenerating axonal growth cone advancing over a permissive substrate. The lamellipodial leading edge advances when actin filaments add monomers at their barbed ends and thereby push the membrane forward, while the actin network simultaneously undergoes rearward movement relative to the substrate driven by non-muscle myosin II (NMII) contractility and membrane tension. Use the following fundamental bases:\n\n- Kinematics of relative motion: the observed speed of a boundary advancing over a substrate equals the forward speed imparted by material addition at that boundary minus the rearward advection speed of the material relative to the substrate.\n- Force–velocity balance for actin retrograde flow in the clutch-limited regime: actomyosin contractile stress $\\sigma$ balanced by effective friction $\\zeta$ against adhesions and the substrate sets a rearward flow speed $v_{\\mathrm{retro}}$ satisfying $v_{\\mathrm{retro}}=\\sigma/\\zeta$ when $\\zeta$ remains constant across conditions.\n\nStarting from these bases, derive an expression linking the leading-edge protrusion speed to the actin barbed-end polymerization-driven forward speed and the actin retrograde flow speed.

The kinematic relationship is a fundamental principle of relative motion. The force-balance equation for retrograde flow is a standard application of low Reynolds number fluid dynamics (specifically, a Stokes' drag model) to cytoskeletal dynamics. The numerical values provided are physiologically realistic for neuronal growth cones. The role of NMII in generating contractile stress is a cornerstone of cell mechanics.

The assumption that retrograde flow scales linearly with contractile stress is a direct mathematical consequence of the given relationship $v_{\\mathrm{retro}}=\\sigma/\\zeta$ and the condition that $\\zeta$ is constant.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe first step is to formalize the kinematic relationship provided in the problem statement. Let $v_{\\mathrm{protrusion}}$ be the protrusion speed of the leading edge, $v_{\\mathrm{poly}}$ be the speed of actin polymerization at the leading edge, and $v_{\\mathrm{retro}}$ be the speed of retrograde flow of the actin network. The problem states that the observed speed of the boundary is the forward speed from material addition minus the rearward speed of the material. This gives the fundamental equation:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{protrusion}} = v_{\\mathrm{poly}} - v_{\\mathrm{retro}}$$\n\nThis equation applies under all conditions. We are asked to find the protrusion speed after the inhibition of NMII, which we will denote as $v_{\\mathrm{protrusion, inhib}}$. This requires us to know the values of $v_{\\mathrm{poly}}$ and the new retrograde flow speed, $v_{\\mathrm{retro, inhib}}$, under the inhibition condition.\n$$v_{\\mathrm{protrusion, inhib}} = v_{\\mathrm{poly}} - v_{\\mathrm{retro, inhib}}$$\n\nThe problem states that $v_{\\mathrm{poly}}$ is unchanged by the treatment, so we can use the control value:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{poly}} = 0.14\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m/s}$$\n\nNext, we must determine $v_{\\mathrm{retro, inhib}}$. The problem provides the force-velocity relationship for retrograde flow:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{retro}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\zeta}$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the contractile stress and $\\zeta$ is the effective friction. In the control condition, we have:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{retro,ctrl}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}}{\\zeta}$$\nIn the inhibited condition, we have:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{retro, inhib}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{inhib}}}{\\zeta}$$\nThe problem states that NMII inhibition reduces the contractile stress $\\sigma$ by $70\\%$. This means the new stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{inhib}}$, is $30\\%$ of the initial control stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}$.\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{inhib}} = (1 - 0.70) \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}} = 0.30 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}$$\n\nSince $\\zeta$ is assumed to be constant, we can substitute this into the equation for $v_{\\mathrm{retro, inhib}}$:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{retro, inhib}} = \\frac{0.30 \\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}}{\\zeta} = 0.30 \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ctrl}}}{\\zeta}\\right)$$\nRecognizing that the term in the parentheses is simply $v_{\\mathrm{retro,ctrl}}$, we find the relationship between the retrograde flow speeds:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{retro, inhib}} = 0.30 \\ v_{\\mathrm{retro,ctrl}}$$\n\nWe are given the control retrograde flow speed, $v_{\\mathrm{retro,ctrl}} = 0.09\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m/s}$. We can now calculate the inhibited retrograde flow speed:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{retro, inhib}} = 0.30 \\times 0.09\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m/s} = 0.027\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m/s}$$\n\nNow we have all the components to calculate the protrusion speed after inhibition, $v_{\\mathrm{protrusion, inhib}}$:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{protrusion, inhib}} = v_{\\mathrm{poly}} - v_{\\mathrm{retro, inhib}}$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{protrusion, inhib}} = 0.14\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m/s} - 0.027\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m/s} = 0.113\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m/s}$$\n\nThe final step is to convert the units from $\\mathrm{\\mu m/s}$ to $\\mathrm{\\mu m/min}$ and round to three significant figures. There are $60$ seconds in $1$ minute.\n$$v_{\\mathrm{protrusion, inhib}} = 0.113\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{\\mu m}}{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\frac{60\\ \\mathrm{s}}{1\\ \\mathrm{min}} = 6.78\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{\\mu m}}{\\mathrm{min}}$$\nThe result $6.78$ is already expressed to three significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.78}$$", "id": "4453107"}, {"introduction": "Successful axon growth depends not only on the intrinsic machinery of the growth cone but also on the permissiveness of the extracellular environment.

It represents a standard problem in deriving a macroscopic rate constant from first-principle microscopic dynamics.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the effective clearance rate constant, $k$, based on a microscopic model of macrophage-mediated debris phagocytosis. The starting point is the given macroscopic law for first-order decay of debris number density, $D(t)$.\n\nThe first-order kinetic decay is described by the equation:\n$$\nD(t) = D_0 \\exp(-k t)\n$$\nwhere $D(t)$ is the number density of debris at time $t$, $D_0$ is the initial density, and $k$ is the rate constant we need to determine.

The problem states that each macrophage moves with an effective speed $v$ and clears debris within a capture radius $r_c$. The debris targets are assumed to be stationary. In an infinitesimal time interval $dt$, a single macrophage sweeps out a cylindrical volume. The length of this cylinder is the distance the macrophage travels, $v \\, dt$. The base of the cylinder is the effective capture cross-section, given as $\\sigma = \\pi r_c^2$.\nThe volume, $dV_{\\text{swept}}$, swept by a single macrophage in time $dt$ is:\n$$\ndV_{\\text{swept}} = \\sigma \\times (v \\, dt) = (\\pi r_c^2) v \\, dt\n$$\nThe number of debris particles, $dN_{\\text{encountered}}$, that this macrophage encounters is the product of the debris number density $D(t)$ and the swept volume $dV_{\\text{swept}}$. The \"well-mixed\" and \"dilute system\" assumptions ensure that the density $D(t)$ is uniform throughout the volume at any given time $t$.\n$$\ndN_{\\text{encountered}} = D(t) \\times dV_{\\text{swept}} = D(t) (\\pi r_c^2 v) \\, dt\n$$\nAccording to the problem, an encounter leads to successful phagocytosis and clearance only with a probability $p$. Therefore, the number of debris particles cleared by a single macrophage in time $dt$, denoted $dN_{\\text{cleared, 1}}$, is:\n$$\ndN_{\\text{cleared, 1}} = p \\times dN_{\\text{encountered}} = p D(t) \\pi r_c^2 v \\, dt\n$$\nThis expression gives the number of debris particles removed by one macrophage. To find the total rate of removal per unit volume, we must consider all macrophages. The problem states that macrophages are uniformly distributed with a number density of $n$ (cells per unit volume). Assuming macrophages act independently, as justified by the \"dilute system\" assumption, the total number of debris particles cleared per unit volume in the time interval $dt$ is the number cleared by one macrophage, $dN_{\\text{cleared, 1}}$, multiplied by the number of macrophages per unit volume, $n$.
