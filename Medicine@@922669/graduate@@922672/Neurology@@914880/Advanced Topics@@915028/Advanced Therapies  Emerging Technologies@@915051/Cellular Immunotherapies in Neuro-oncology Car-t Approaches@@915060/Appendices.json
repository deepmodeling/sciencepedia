It contains a self-contained and internally consistent set of parameters and conditions, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is based on fundamental principles of physics and cell biology, specifically the definition of number density and the conservation of matter (in this case, cells) over a short time interval where biological processes like proliferation and apoptosis are negligible. The parameters provided are plausible within the context of neuro-oncological therapies. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a formal solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to determine the total number of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells (CAR-T), denoted as $N_{infused}$, that must be infused to achieve a specified target state.\n\nFirst, let us define the given parameters and variables:\n- The target retained local CAR-T number density is $C_{target} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{cells}/\\mathrm{mL}$.\n- The volume of the lesion is $V_{lesion} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n- The fraction of infused cells lost due to pressure-driven outflow is $f_{loss} = 40\\% = 0.40$.\n- The fraction of infused cells retained locally is $f_{retained} = 100\\% - f_{loss} = 100\\% - 40\\% = 60\\% = 0.60$.\n- Let $N_{retained}$ be the total number of cells that must be retained within the lesion to achieve the target density.\n- Let $N_{infused}$ be the total number of cells that must be initially infused.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the required number of cells, $N_{retained}$, that must be present in the lesion volume to meet the target number density. The definition of number density ($C$) is the number of particles ($N$) per unit volume ($V$), given by the relation:\n$$C = \\frac{N}{V}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the number of cells:\n$$N = C \\times V$$\nApplying this to our specific problem, the number of retained cells is:\n$$N_{retained} = C_{target} \\times V_{lesion}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$N_{retained} = (1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{cells}/\\mathrm{mL}) \\times (2.0\\,\\mathrm{mL})$$\n$$N_{retained} = 2.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{cells}$$\nThis is the absolute number of CAR-T cells that must remain in the tumor after the initial post-infusion loss.\n\nThe second step is to relate this required retained cell number to the total number of cells that must be infused. The problem states that a fraction $f_{retained}$ of the total infused cells, $N_{infused}$, is retained locally. This relationship is based on the principle of cell number conservation immediately after infusion and is expressed as:\n$$N_{retained} = f_{retained} \\times N_{infused}$$\nOur goal is to find $N_{infused}$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for it:\n$$N_{infused} = \\frac{N_{retained}}{f_{retained}}$$\nNow, we substitute the values for $N_{retained}$ and $f_{retained}$:\n$$N_{infused} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{cells}}{0.60}$$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$N_{infused} = \\frac{2.0}{0.6} \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{cells}$$\n$$N_{infused} = \\frac{20}{6} \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{cells}$$\n$$N_{infused} = \\frac{10}{3} \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{cells}$$\n$$N_{infused} = 3.3333... \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{cells}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

We are given that $K$ follows a Poisson distribution with a mean (or rate parameter) of $\\lambda$. The Poisson distribution models the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for a Poisson-distributed random variable $K$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(K=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of occurrences (here, the integer copy number), which can be any non-negative integer ($k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$), $\\lambda$ is the average number of occurrences, and $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nNext, we must compute the fraction of cells with more than $3$ vector copies, which is the probability $\\mathbb{P}(K>3)$, given that the average is $\\lambda=2$.\n\nThe event $K>3$ corresponds to the cell having $4$, $5$, $6$, or more vector copies.
