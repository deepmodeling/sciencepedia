It describes a standard, simplified model of receptor pharmacology based on the law of mass action (the Hill-Langmuir equation). The premises are scientifically sound, the terminology is precise, and the provided data ($EC_{50}$) are sufficient and consistent for determining the required concentration. The problem is well-posed and directly relevant to the field of neuropharmacology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Agonist Concentration**\n\nThe binding of a single agonist molecule, which we denote by concentration $C$, to a single receptor site $R$ to form an agonist-receptor complex $CR$ can be represented by the equilibrium reaction:\n$$C + R \\rightleftharpoons CR$$\nAccording to the law of mass action, the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined as:\n$$K_D = \\frac{[C][R]}{[CR]}$$\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R_T]$, is the sum of the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$, and the concentration of occupied receptors, $[CR]$:\n$$[R_T] = [R] + [CR]$$\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is the ratio of the concentration of occupied receptors to the total concentration of receptors:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[CR]}{[R_T]}$$\nWe can express $[R]$ as $[R] = [R_T] - [CR]$ and substitute this into the expression for $K_D$:\n$$K_D = \\frac{[C]([R_T] - [CR])}{[CR]}$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the fractional occupancy $\\theta$. First, we solve for $[CR]$:\n$$K_D [CR] = [C][R_T] - [C][CR]$$\n$$K_D [CR] + [C][CR] = [C][R_T]$$\n$$[CR](K_D + [C]) = [C][R_T]$$\n$$\\frac{[CR]}{[R_T]} = \\frac{[C]}{K_D + [C]}$$\nThus, the fractional occupancy is:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{C}{K_D + C}$$\nwhere we replace $[C]$ with the simpler notation $C$.\n\nThe problem states that the observed effect, $E$, scales linearly with the fraction of occupied receptors. This implies a direct proportionality:\n$$E = k \\cdot \\theta$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality representing the intrinsic efficacy and total receptor number. The maximal effect for this specific agonist, $E_{\\text{max}}$, is achieved when all receptors are occupied (i.e., at saturating concentration, where $\\theta \\to 1$). Therefore, $E_{\\text{max}} = k \\cdot 1 = k$. Substituting $k$ with $E_{\\text{max}}$, the concentration-effect relationship becomes:\n$$E = E_{\\text{max}} \\cdot \\theta = E_{\\text{max}} \\frac{C}{K_D + C}$$\nThis is the hyperbolic concentration-effect equation. The problem states that for this system, the half-maximal effective concentration, $EC_{50}$, is equal to the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$. This is consistent with the derived equation, as setting $C = K_D$ gives $E = E_{\\text{max}} \\frac{K_D}{K_D + K_D} = E_{\\text{max}} \\frac{K_D}{2 K_D} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\text{max}}$.\nWe are given $EC_{50} = 20$ nM, so we have $K_D = 20$ nM.\n\nWe need to find the concentration $C$ that produces an effect equal to $0.70$ of the maximal effect. That is, $E = 0.70 \\cdot E_{\\text{max}}$. We set up the equation:\n$$0.70 \\cdot E_{\\text{max}} = E_{\\text{max}} \\frac{C}{K_D + C}$$\nThe term $E_{\\text{max}}$ cancels from both sides:\n$$0.70 = \\frac{C}{K_D + C}$$\nWe now solve for $C$:\n$$0.70 (K_D + C) = C$$\n$$0.70 \\cdot K_D + 0.70 \\cdot C = C$$\n$$0.70 \\cdot K_D = C - 0.70 \\cdot C$$\n$$0.70 \\cdot K_D = C (1 - 0.70)$$\n$$0.70 \\cdot K_D = 0.30 \\cdot C$$\n$$C = \\frac{0.70}{0.30} K_D = \\frac{7}{3} K_D$$\nSubstituting the given value $K_D = 20$ nM:\n$$C = \\frac{7}{3} (20 \\text{ nM}) = \\frac{140}{3} \\text{ nM}$$\nCalculating the numerical value and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$C \\approx 46.666... \\text{ nM} \\approx 46.67 \\text{ nM}$$\n\n**Part 2: Explanation of Partial Agonism and Dependence on $E_{\\text{max}}$**\n\nFirst-principles of receptor theory distinguish agonists based on their intrinsic efficacy ($\\epsilon$), a measure of the ability of the drug-receptor complex to produce a response. The total response $E$ is a function of receptor occupancy and efficacy. A simplified model is $E = \\epsilon \\cdot [R_T] \\cdot \\theta$.\n\nPartial agonism refers to the behavior of an agonist that possesses intermediate intrinsic efficacy. Even when it occupies all available receptors (saturating concentration, $\\theta=1$), it cannot elicit the maximal possible response that the biological system is capable of producing. The maximal effect for a partial agonist ($E_{\\text{max, partial}}$) is therefore lower than the system's maximal response ($E_{\\text{system\\_max}}$), which is defined by the action of a full agonist (a drug with high intrinsic efficacy). In summary, partial agonism modifies (reduces) the maximal effect, $E_{\\text{max}}$, of the drug itself, such that $0 < E_{\\text{max, partial}} < E_{\\text{system\\_max}}$.\n\nRegarding the second question, the calculation performed to find the concentration $C$ does **not** depend on the absolute magnitude of $E_{\\text{max}}$. As shown in the derivation, the target effect was set as a fraction of the drug's own maximal effect ($E = 0.70 \\cdot E_{\\text{max}}$). In the resulting equation:\n$$0.70 \\cdot E_{\\text{max}} = E_{\\text{max}} \\frac{C}{K_D + C}$$\nthe term $E_{\\text{max}}$ cancels out. The final expression for the concentration, $C = \\frac{7}{3} K_D$, depends only on the receptor affinity ($K_D$) and the desired fractional response ($0.70$). Therefore, under the stated assumptions of proportional transduction and negligible receptor reserve, any agonist (full or partial) with a $K_D$ of $20$ nM would require the exact same concentration ($46.67$ nM) to achieve $70\\%$ of its own, specific maximal effect, regardless of whether that maximal effect is large (full agonist) or small (partial agonist).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{46.67}\n$$", "id": "4509085"}, {"introduction": "Psychoactive therapeutics ultimately function by altering the electrical behavior of neurons, the fundamental units of information processing in the brain.
