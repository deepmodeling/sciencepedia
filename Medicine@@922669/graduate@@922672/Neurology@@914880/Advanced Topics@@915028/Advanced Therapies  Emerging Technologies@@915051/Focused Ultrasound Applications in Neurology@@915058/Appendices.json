The underlying principle, rooted in Arrhenius kinetics, is that the rate of thermally induced biological damage, let's denote it as $\\dot{\\Omega}$, is a strong function of temperature.\n\nThe total accumulated damage, $\\Omega$, over a time interval from $t=0$ to $t=t_{\\text{final}}$ is given by the integral of the damage rate:\n$$ \\Omega = \\int_0^{t_{\\text{final}}} \\dot{\\Omega}(T(t)) dt $$\nThe CEM43 is defined as the time $t_{\\text{eq}}$ that would produce the same total damage $\\Omega$ if the temperature were held constant at $T_{\\text{ref}}$:\n$$ \\Omega = \\dot{\\Omega}(T_{\\text{ref}}) \\cdot t_{\\text{eq}} = \\dot{\\Omega}(T_{\\text{ref}}) \\cdot \\text{CEM43} $$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\Omega$ gives:\n$$ \\dot{\\Omega}(T_{\\text{ref}}) \\cdot \\text{CEM43} = \\int_0^{t_{\\text{final}}} \\dot{\\Omega}(T(t)) dt $$\nSolving for CEM43, we get:\n$$ \\text{CEM43} = \\int_0^{t_{\\text{final}}} \\frac{\\dot{\\Omega}(T(t))}{\\dot{\\Omega}(T_{\\text{ref}})} dt $$\nThe term $\\frac{\\dot{\\Omega}(T(t))}{\\dot{\\Omega}(T_{\\text{ref}})}$ is the dimensionless temperature-dependent weighting factor. The problem states that for temperatures $T \\ge 43^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, the injury rate approximately doubles for each $1^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ increase. Let us formalize this relationship. The ratio of the damage rate at a temperature $T$ to the damage rate at the reference temperature $T_{\\text{ref}} = 43^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ can be expressed as an exponential function. For each degree Celsius above $T_{\\text{ref}}$, the rate is multiplied by a factor of $2$. Thus, for a temperature difference of $(T - T_{\\text{ref}})$ degrees, the rate is multiplied by $2$ this many times.\nThis leads to the weighting factor for $T \\ge T_{\\text{ref}}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\dot{\\Omega}(T)}{\\dot{\\Omega}(T_{\\text{ref}})} = 2^{(T - T_{\\text{ref}})} $$\nwhere temperatures are in degrees Celsius.\n\nThe problem defines the model using a parameter $R=0.5$.

The integrand $R^{(43 - T(t))}$ is constant.\n$$ R^{(43 - T(t))} = (0.5)^{(43 - 55)} = (0.5)^{(-12)} $$\nThe integral simplifies to the constant integrand multiplied by the duration of the interval:\n$$ \\text{CEM43} = \\int_0^{1/3} (0.5)^{(-12)} dt = (0.5)^{(-12)} \\cdot \\int_0^{1/3} dt $$\n$$ \\text{CEM43} = (0.5)^{(-12)} \\cdot \\left[t\\right]_0^{1/3} = (0.5)^{(-12)} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - 0\\right) $$\n$$ \\text{CEM43} = (0.5)^{(-12)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} $$\nNow we evaluate this expression numerically.\n$$ (0.5)^{(-12)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{(-12)} = 2^{12} $$\nWe know that $2^{10} = 1024$, so $2^{12} = 2^{10} \\times 2^2 = 1024 \\times 4 = 4096$.\n$$ \\text{CEM43} = 4096 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4096}{3} $$\n$$ \\text{CEM43} \\approx 1365.333... \\text{ minutes} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
