The solution is presented in three parts, corresponding to the three tasks.\n\nFirst, we derive an expression for the expected net number of additional patients achieving a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale, mRS score of $0$–$2$) when $N$ patients are treated with EVT compared to best medical management.\n\nLet $X_i$ be an indicator random variable for the outcome of the $i$-th patient, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. The variable $X_i$ is defined as:\n$$\nX_i = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if the patient achieves a favorable outcome (mRS } 0\\text{–}2\\text{)} \\\\ 0  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe outcome for patient $i$ follows a Bernoulli distribution. The parameter of this distribution depends on the assigned treatment arm.\n\nLet $p_{\\mathrm{EVT}}$ be the probability of a favorable outcome for a patient treated with EVT. The expected value of the outcome for a single patient in the EVT arm is:\n$$ E[X_{\\mathrm{EVT}}] = 1 \\cdot P(X_{\\mathrm{EVT}}=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_{\\mathrm{EVT}}=0) = p_{\\mathrm{EVT}} $$\nLet $p_{\\mathrm{control}}$ be the probability of a favorable outcome for a patient receiving best medical management (control). The expected value of the outcome for a single patient in the control arm is:\n$$ E[X_{\\mathrm{control}}] = p_{\\mathrm{control}} $$\nThe problem states that patient-level outcomes are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) within each arm.

The probabilities of a favorable outcome are given as:\n$p_{\\mathrm{EVT}} = 0.50$\n$p_{\\mathrm{control}} = 0.30$\n\nThe absolute risk difference for the favorable outcome, which we denote $ARD_f$, is:\n$$ ARD_f = p_{\\mathrm{EVT}} - p_{\\mathrm{control}} = 0.50 - 0.30 = 0.20 $$\nThis value is an exact decimal fraction as required.\n\nUsing the formula derived above, we calculate the NNT:\n$$ \\mathrm{NNT} = \\frac{1}{ARD_f} = \\frac{1}{0.20} = \\frac{1}{1/5} = 5 $$\nThe NNT is $5$.
