It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. Proceeding with the solution.\n\nThe solution begins by deriving the governing equation for tracer concentration from the principle of mass conservation in the control volume. Let $C(t)$ be the uniform concentration of the tracer within the parenchymal control volume $V$ at time $t$. The total mass of the tracer in the volume is $M(t) = C(t)V$.\n\nThe law of conservation of mass states that the rate of change of mass within the control volume is equal to the rate of mass flowing in minus the rate of mass flowing out:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = \\dot{m}_{\\text{in}} - \\dot{m}_{\\text{out}}\n$$\nSubstituting $M(t) = C(t)V$ and assuming the volume $V$ is constant, we get:\n$$\nV\\frac{dC}{dt} = \\dot{m}_{\\text{in}} - \\dot{m}_{\\text{out}}\n$$\nLet $Q$ be the volumetric flow rate of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the control volume. The rates of mass flow are given by the product of the volumetric flow rate and the concentration.\n$$\n\\dot{m}_{\\text{in}} = Q C_{\\text{in}}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{m}_{\\text{out}} = Q C_{\\text{out}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the tracer concentration in the inflowing CSF is negligible, so we set $C_{\\text{in}} = 0$. This implies $\\dot{m}_{\\text{in}} = 0$.\nThe problem also models the region as a \"well-mixed control volume\". This means the concentration is uniform throughout the volume, and thus the concentration of the fluid leaving the volume is the same as the concentration inside the volume, i.e., $C_{\\text{out}}(t) = C(t)$.\nSubstituting these conditions into the mass balance equation gives:\n$$\nV\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0 - Q C(t)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = -\\frac{Q}{V} C(t)\n$$\nThis equation describes an exponential decay process. Integrating with respect to time from $t=0$ to $t$ gives the solution:\n$$\nC(t) = C(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{V} t\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C(0)$ is the initial concentration of the tracer at $t=0$.\n\nThe problem asks for an expression for the cleared fraction, $f_{\\text{cleared}}$. The cleared fraction is the amount of tracer mass removed by time $t$ divided by the initial tracer mass.\nInitial mass: $M(0) = C(0)V$.\nMass at time $t$: $M(t) = C(t)V$.\nMass cleared: $M_{\\text{cleared}}(t) = M(0) - M(t) = (C(0) - C(t))V$.\nCleared fraction:\n$$\nf_{\\text{cleared}}(t) = \\frac{M_{\\text{cleared}}(t)}{M(0)} = \\frac{(C(0) - C(t))V}{C(0)V} = 1 - \\frac{C(t)}{C(0)}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C(t)$:\n$$\nf_{\\text{cleared}}(t) = 1 - \\frac{C(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{V} t\\right)}{C(0)} = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Q}{V} t\\right)\n$$\nNext, we relate the term $Q/V$ to the given parameters, inflow speed $U$ and effective length scale $L$. The volumetric flow rate is $Q = UA$, where $A$ is the effective cross-sectional area of the flow paths. The volume of the parenchymal region is modeled as $V = AL$. The ratio is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{Q}{V} = \\frac{UA}{AL} = \\frac{U}{L}\n$$\nThe cancellation of the area $A$ is justified by the problem statement that \"All other geometric factors are held fixed between states.\"\nThus, the derived expression for the cleared fraction as a function of $U$, $L$, and $t$ is:\n$$\nf_{\\text{cleared}}(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U}{L} t\\right)\n$$\nNow, we must evaluate the ratio of the cleared fraction during NREM sleep to that during wakefulness over $t=1$ hour.\n$$\nR = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{NREM}}}{f_{\\mathrm{wake}}} = \\frac{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U_{\\mathrm{NREM}}}{L} t\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U_{\\mathrm{wake}}}{L} t\\right)}\n$$\nThe given values are:\n$U_{\\mathrm{wake}} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$\n$U_{\\mathrm{NREM}} = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$\n$L = 50\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 50 \\times 10^3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n$t = 1\\,\\text{hour} = 3600\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nWe calculate the dimensionless arguments of the exponential functions.\nFor NREM sleep:\n$$\n\\frac{U_{\\mathrm{NREM}}t}{L} = \\frac{(50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s})(3600\\,\\mathrm{s})}{50 \\times 10^3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{50 \\times 3600}{50000} = \\frac{3600}{1000} = 3.6\n$$\nFor wakefulness:\n$$\n\\frac{U_{\\mathrm{wake}}t}{L} = \\frac{(20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s})(3600\\,\\mathrm{s})}{50 \\times 10^3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{20 \\times 3600}{50000} = \\frac{2 \\times 3600}{5000} = \\frac{7200}{5000} = 1.44\n$$\nNow substitute these values into the ratio expression:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-3.6)}{1 - \\exp(-1.44)}\n$$\nWe evaluate the exponentials:\n$\\exp(-3.6) \\approx 0.027253$\n$\\exp(-1.44) \\approx 0.236928$\n\nSo, the ratio is:\n$$\nR \\approx \\frac{1 - 0.027253}{1 - 0.236928} = \\frac{0.972747}{0.763072} \\approx 1.274843\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the final answer is $1.275$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1.275} $$", "id": "4483528"}, {"introduction": "Effective glymphatic function depends on precise molecular organization, particularly the polarization of Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels at astrocytic endfeet.

Endfoot Water Permeability ($P_{\\mathrm{e}}$)**\n\nTotal endfoot permeability $P_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is the sum of an AQP4-dependent component, $P_{\\mathrm{e, AQP4}}$, and an AQP4-independent component, $P_{\\mathrm{e, ind}}$.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{e}} = P_{\\mathrm{e, AQP4}} + P_{\\mathrm{e, ind}}$$\nThe problem states that the AQP4-dependent component is proportional to the amount of AQP4 at the endfeet.\n\nAt baseline (state $0$):\n$$P_{\\mathrm{e, AQP4}, 0} = 0.8 \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{e}, 0}$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{e, ind}} = 0.2 \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{e}, 0}$$\n\nSince $P_{\\mathrm{e, AQP4}}$ is proportional to $A_{\\mathrm{e}}$, a $50\\%$ reduction in $A_{\\mathrm{e}}$ results in a $50\\%$ reduction in $P_{\\mathrm{e, AQP4}}$.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{e, AQP4}, 1} = 0.5 \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{e, AQP4}, 0} = 0.5 \\cdot (0.8 \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{e}, 0}) = 0.4 \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{e}, 0}$$\nThe AQP4-independent permeability is constant as it is not related to AQP4.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{e, ind}, 1} = P_{\\mathrm{e, ind}} = 0.2 \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{e}, 0}$$\n\nThe new total endfoot permeability, $P_{\\mathrm{e}, 1}$, is:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{e}, 1} = P_{\\mathrm{e, AQP4}, 1} + P_{\\mathrm{e, ind}, 1} = (0.4 \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{e}, 0}) + (0.2 \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{e}, 0}) = 0.6 \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{e}, 0}$$\nThus, the endfoot water permeability decreases to $60\\%$ of its baseline value, which is a decrease of $40\\%$.\n\n**3.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\n### 1. Derivation of the Clearance Model\n\nThe analysis begins from the fundamental principle stated in the problem: the rate of tracer clearance is proportional to the amount of tracer available for clearance. The total tracer signal at time $t$ is denoted by $y(t)$. A constant signal floor, $C$, represents a non-clearable background. Therefore, the amount of tracer available for clearance at any given time is the signal above this floor, i.e., $y(t) - C$.\n\nThe time rate of change of the tracer signal is $\\frac{dy}{dt}$. Since this is a clearance process, the signal decreases over time. The proportionality to the clearable amount is captured by a rate constant, $k > 0$. This relationship is formulated as a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = -k (y(t) - C)\n$$\nThis ODE is separable and can be solved by rearranging and integrating. For $y(t) \\neq C$:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{y - C} = -k \\, dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to a time $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{y(0)}^{y(t)} \\frac{1}{y' - C} \\, dy' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\left[ \\ln|y' - C| \\right]_{y(0)}^{y(t)} = \\left[ -k\\tau \\right]_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln|y(t) - C| - \\ln|y(0) - C| = -kt\n$$\nAssuming $y(t)$ is always greater than or equal to $C$, the absolute value can be dropped.\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{y(t) - C}{y(0) - C}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives:\n$$\n\\frac{y(t) - C}{y(0) - C} = e^{-kt}\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $y(t)$:\n$$\ny(t) - C = (y(0) - C)e^{-kt}\n$$\n$$\ny(t) = (y(0) - C)e^{-kt} + C\n$$\nWe define the initial amplitude of the clearable tracer component as $A = y(0) - C$. The constraints $A > 0$ and $C \\ge 0$ are physically meaningful, implying an initial signal greater than the background floor. This yields the final mathematical form of the clearance curve:\n$$\ny(t) = A e^{-kt} + C\n$$\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Half-Life ($t_{1/2}$)\n\nThe problem defines the clearance half-life, $t_{1/2}$, as the time required for the exponential component of the signal to decay to half of its initial value. The exponential component of the signal is the term $A e^{-kt}$. Its initial value at $t=0$ is $A e^{-k \\cdot 0} = A$.\n\nWe seek the time $t_{1/2}$ such that the component's value is $\\frac{A}{2}$:\n$$\nA e^{-k t_{1/2}} = \\frac{A}{2}\n$$\nDividing by $A$ (since $A>0$):\n$$\ne^{-k t_{1/2}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(e^{-k t_{1/2}}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2)\n$$\n$$\n-k t_{1/2} = -\\ln(2)\n$$\nSolving for $t_{1/2}$ yields the expression for the half-life:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}\n$$\n\n### 3. Parameter Estimation Algorithm\n\nThe task is to estimate the parameters $p = (A, k, C)$ from a set of discrete observations $(t_i, y_i)$. The specified method is to minimize the sum of squared residuals (SSR) between the observed data and the model's predictions. The SSR is given by:\n$$\n\\text{SSR}(A, k, C) = \\sum_{i} \\left( y_i - (A e^{-kt_i} + C) \\right)^2\n$$\nThis is a non-linear least-squares optimization problem. The algorithm will employ the `scipy.optimize.least_squares` function from the SciPy library, which is a robust tool for solving such problems. The function iteratively adjusts the parameters $(A, k, C)$ to find the set that minimizes the sum of squares of the residuals, $r_i = y_i - y(t_i)$. The parameter constraints $A > 0$, $k > 0$, and $C \\ge 0$ will be enforced using the `bounds` argument of the function. For noise-free data generated from the model itself, this method is guaranteed to recover the original parameters.\n\n### 4. Clinical Interpretation\n\nThe final step is to interpret the change in clearance between a baseline and a post-intervention measurement. This is done by calculating the fractional reduction in half-life, $R_f$:\n$$\nR_f = \\frac{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{baseline}} - t_{1/2,\\mathrm{post}}}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{baseline}}}\n$$\nA clinically meaningful improvement is defined by the decision rule $R_f \\ge 0.15$. The algorithm will compute $R_f$ from the estimated half-lives and output an integer flag: $1$ if the improvement is meaningful, and $0$ otherwise.\n\nThe overall procedure implemented in the accompanying code is as follows:\n1. For each test case, generate the baseline and post-intervention signal data $y(t_i)$ at the specified time points $T$ using the given true parameters.\n2. For both baseline and post-intervention data, use non-linear least-squares optimization to estimate the parameters $(\\hat{A}, \\hat{k}, \\hat{C})$.\n3. From the estimated rate constants, $\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{baseline}}$ and $\\hat{k}_{\\mathrm{post}}$, calculate the corresponding half-lives, $\\hat{t}_{1/2,\\mathrm{baseline}}$ and $\\hat{t}_{1/2,\\mathrm{post}}$.\n4. Calculate the fractional reduction $R_f$ and determine the clinical flag.\n5. Format the results ($k$, $t_{1/2}$ to $4$ significant figures; $R_f$ to $4$ decimal places) and present them in the specified list format.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import least_squares\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the glymphatic clearance modeling problem.\n    This function processes four test cases, each with a baseline and\n    post-intervention condition.
