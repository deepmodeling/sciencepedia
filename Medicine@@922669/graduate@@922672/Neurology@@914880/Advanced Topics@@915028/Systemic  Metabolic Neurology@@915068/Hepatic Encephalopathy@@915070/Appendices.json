The premises—that uncharged $\\text{NH}_3$ is membrane-permeant while charged $\\text{NH}_4^+$ is not, and the relevance of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation—are fundamentally correct. The problem is therefore valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the fraction of total ammonia present as uncharged $\\text{NH}_3$, denoted $f_{\\text{NH}_3}$, and its subsequent application.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $f_{\\text{NH}_3}(\\text{pH}, \\text{p}K_a)$.

The calculation shows a positive change, $\\Delta f > 0$, meaning the fraction of total ammonia existing as the uncharged, lipid-soluble form $\\text{NH}_3$ increases as the blood becomes more alkalemic (higher $\\text{pH}$). Since uncharged $\\text{NH}_3$ readily diffuses across cell membranes like the blood-brain barrier (BBB) while the charged, hydrophilic $\\text{NH}_4^+$ ion does not, this shift is clinically significant. The increase in the fraction of permeant $\\text{NH}_3$ in the blood raises the concentration gradient of $\\text{NH}_3$ across the BBB. Consequently, the passive diffusion of ammonia from the blood into the brain's extracellular fluid is enhanced. In the context of hepatic encephalopathy, where ammonia is a primary neurotoxin, this increased influx of ammonia into the central nervous system will exacerbate brain ammonia toxicity and worsen the patient's neurological condition.
