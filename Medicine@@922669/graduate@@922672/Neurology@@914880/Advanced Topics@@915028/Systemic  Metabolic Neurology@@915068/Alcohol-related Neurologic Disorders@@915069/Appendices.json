In advanced neurotoxicology, ethanol elimination is governed by enzyme-limited biotransformation via Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH), which at high substrate concentrations exhibits saturation kinetics. When the substrate concentration $C(t)$ is much greater than the Michaelis constant $K_{m}$ for the enzyme, the elimination proceeds in a concentration-independent manner (zero-order), meaning the rate of decrease in blood ethanol concentration is constant over time and does not depend on $C(t)$.

The provided numerical values for concentrations and elimination rate are consistent with clinically observed data. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem states that ethanol elimination follows zero-order kinetics. This implies that the rate of change of the blood ethanol concentration, $C(t)$, with respect to time, $t$, is constant. Since the concentration is decreasing, the rate of change is negative.

To minimize the risk of Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome (ODS), assume the following biophysical model of the brain during sodium correction over $24$ hours:\n- Water crosses neuronal and glial membranes rapidly, while intracellular osmoles equilibrate slowly over $24$ hours. Thus, over this time window, intracellular osmoles can be treated as constant.\n- At the onset of therapy, the brain is in osmotic steady state with the extracellular fluid, so intracellular effective osmolality equals extracellular effective osmolality.\n- Effective extracellular osmolality is dominated by sodium salts and may be approximated by $C \\approx 2 [ \\mathrm{Na}^+ ]$ (in mOsm/kg).\n- If extracellular effective osmolality is increased by $\\Delta C$ over $24$ hours, the final cell volume $V_f$ relative to initial volume $V_i$ is determined by osmotic equilibrium under conservation of intracellular osmoles.\n\nLet $C_b$ denote the baseline effective osmolality and suppose that, to avoid clinically significant cell shrinkage that predisposes to ODS in high-risk states such as chronic AUD and malnutrition, the allowed fractional brain cell volume decrease over $24$ hours is bounded by a tolerance $\\phi_{\\max} = 0.05$ (dimensionless).

It is based on fundamental principles of osmosis and directly relevant to the clinical management of hyponatremia, a topic within neurology and critical care medicine. All necessary data and constraints are provided to derive a unique, meaningful solution. Thus, the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution is derived from the principle of osmotic equilibrium and the conservation of intracellular osmoles over a $24$-hour time frame. Let $V_i$ and $C_i$ be the initial cell volume and initial extracellular effective osmolality, respectively. Let $V_f$ and $C_f$ be the final volume and osmolality after therapeutic intervention. The problem states that at the onset, the system is in osmotic equilibrium, so the intracellular osmolality equals the extracellular osmolality, $C_{in, i} = C_i$. The total number of osmoles inside the cell, $N_{in}$, is given by the product of the intracellular osmolality and the cell volume.\n\n$$N_{in} = C_{in, i} \\cdot V_i = C_i V_i$$\n\nAccording to the model, these intracellular osmoles are conserved over the $24$-hour period. After the extracellular osmolality is raised to $C_f$, the cell volume adjusts to a new value, $V_f$, to re-establish osmotic equilibrium. At this final state, the new intracellular osmolality equals the new extracellular osmolality, $C_{in, f} = C_f$. The number of intracellular osmoles is now given by:\n\n$$N_{in} = C_{in, f} \\cdot V_f = C_f V_f$$\n\nBy the conservation of intracellular osmoles, we can equate the initial and final expressions for $N_{in}$:\n\n$$C_i V_i = C_f V_f$$\n\nThis relation can be rearranged to express the ratio of the final to initial cell volume in terms of osmolalities:\n\n$$\\frac{V_f}{V_i} = \\frac{C_i}{C_f}$$\n\nThe problem imposes a constraint on the fractional decrease in brain cell volume, which is defined as $\\frac{V_i - V_f}{V_i}$.
