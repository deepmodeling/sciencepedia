The problem provides the necessary parameters and the formula. The given parameters are:\nThe longest diameter on the axial slice with the largest hemorrhage area, $A = 5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\nThe longest perpendicular diameter on the same slice, $B = 3\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\nThe craniocaudal extent of the hemorrhage, $C = 4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.

Its validity rests on a set of geometric and measurement assumptions that must be critically evaluated.\n\n1.  **Geometric Basis and Mathematical Approximation**:\n    The fundamental assumption of the $ABC/2$ method is that the hemorrhage is shaped like a perfect ellipsoid. The volume of a perfect ellipsoid is given by the formula:\n    $$V_{\\text{ellipsoid}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_1 r_2 r_3$$\n    where $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$ are the semi-axes of the ellipsoid. In the context of CT measurements, the diameters $A$, $B$, and $C$ are taken as the full axial lengths, such that $A = 2r_1$, $B = 2r_2$, and $C = 2r_3$. Substituting these into the ellipsoid volume formula yields:\n    $$V_{\\text{ellipsoid}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{A}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{B}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{C}{2}\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi ABC}{24} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} ABC$$\n    The numerical value of the coefficient is $\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\approx \\frac{3.14159}{6} \\approx 0.5236$. The clinical formula $V = \\frac{ABC}{2}$ uses a coefficient of $\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$.\n    This reveals two key aspects of the $ABC/2$ formula:\n    a.  **Geometric Assumption**: It models the IPH as an ellipsoid.\n    b.  **Mathematical Approximation**: It approximates the geometric coefficient $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$ with the simpler fraction $\\frac{1}{2}$ for ease of bedside calculation. Since $\\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{\\pi}{6}$, the $ABC/2$ formula systematically *underestimates* the volume of a perfect ellipsoid by a factor of $(\\frac{\\pi}{6} - \\frac{1}{2}) / \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\approx 4.5\\%$.\n\n2.  **Impact of Irregular Shape**:\n    The most significant limitation of the $ABC/2$ method is the assumption of an ellipsoid shape. Real hematomas, particularly those resulting from trauma, are rarely perfect ellipsoids. They are often irregular, lobulated, or complex in morphology, following paths of least resistance through brain parenchyma. For a given set of maximum dimensions $A$, $B$, and $C$ (which define a bounding box), a regular ellipsoid has a much larger volume than an irregular object confined within the same box. Therefore, applying an ellipsoid-based formula to an irregularly shaped hematoma tends to *overestimate* its true volume. This overestimation due to the shape assumption often outweighs the slight mathematical underestimation from using $\\frac{1}{2}$ instead of $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$. Consequently, empirical studies comparing the $ABC/2$ method to the gold-standard planimetric method (summing the area of the hemorrhage on each CT slice) have shown that the $ABC/2$ formula typically overestimates the true volume of irregularly shaped hematomas.\n\n3.  **Measurement Conventions and Errors**:\n    The accuracy of the method also depends heavily on the consistency and precision of the measurements:\n    -   $A$ and $B$ are measured on the single axial slice with the largest hemorrhage area. This assumes that the maximal diameters of the entire $3$D lesion are represented on this one plane, which may not be true for tilted or complex shapes.\n    -   The measurement of $C$ is the product of slice thickness and the number of slices containing the hemorrhage. This can be prone to error at the superior and inferior poles of the hematoma, where partial volume effects may make it difficult to determine the first and last slices on which the hemorrhage is truly present.\n\n4.  **Relevance to Primary and Secondary Injury in TBI**:\n    The pathophysiology of TBI affects the validity of the estimate over time.\n    -   **Primary Injury**: The initial mechanical insult causes vessel rupture and hemorrhage. The resulting hematoma's shape is dictated by the forces of the injury and the anatomical planes it dissects. This can result in a highly irregular hematoma from the outset, immediately challenging the core assumption of an ellipsoid shape and reducing the accuracy of the $ABC/2$ method.\n    -   **Secondary Injury**: The subsequent biological cascade further complicates the measurement.\n        -   **Perihematomal Edema**: A crucial component of secondary injury is the formation of vasogenic and cytotoxic edema in the brain tissue surrounding the IPH. On CT, this edema appears as a hypodense (dark) halo around the hyperdense (bright) acute blood. While a radiologist aims to measure the diameters of the hemorrhage itself, the boundary can be obscured by this edema, potentially leading to inadvertent inclusion of the edematous region in the measurements of $A$ and $B$. This would artificially inflate the measured diameters and lead to a significant overestimation of the true hemorrhage volume.\n        -   **Hematoma Evolution**: Over days to weeks, the hematoma undergoes liquefaction and resorption. Its density on CT decreases, its borders become less distinct, and its overall shape can change. In the subacute and chronic stages of TBI, the heterogeneous and ill-defined appearance of the resolving hematoma makes the application of the $ABC/2$ method highly subjective and unreliable.\n\nIn summary, the $ABC/2$ method is a rapid and convenient tool for estimating IPH volume but is subject to significant inaccuracies. Its primary assumption of an ellipsoid shape is often violated by real-world hematomas, typically leading to volume overestimation. The validity of the method is further compromised by the dynamic changes in hematoma shape and the development of perihematomal edema that occur as part of the primary and secondary injury processes in TBI. For these reasons, while useful for triage, it is considered less accurate than computer-assisted planimetric volume calculation, which serves as the reference standard.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{30}$$", "id": "4532164"}, {"introduction": "Following the primary impact, the focus of TBI management shifts to mitigating secondary injury, which is fundamentally a metabolic crisis.

The measured values are: $CBF = 50$ mL blood per $100$ g brain per min, $CaO_2 = 20$ mL O$_2$ per dL blood, and $CvO_2 = 14$ mL O$_2$ per dL blood. Using only conservation of mass for oxygen across the cerebral circulation and the Fick principle of organ oxygen consumption, derive the appropriate expression to compute the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO$_2$) from these quantities, taking care to address unit consistency. Then calculate the numerical value of CMRO$_2$ and state whether it is consistent with normal adult cerebral oxygen metabolism at normothermia.

The principle states that the rate of consumption of a substance by an organ is equal to the rate at which the substance is delivered by arterial blood minus the rate at which it is carried away by venous blood.\n\nLet us consider a mass of brain tissue, $M_{brain} = 100 \\text{ g}$.\nThe rate of oxygen consumption by this mass of tissue is the quantity $CMRO_2$ we seek, with units of $\\frac{\\mathrm{mL~O}_2}{100~\\mathrm{g~brain} \\cdot \\mathrm{min}}$.\n\nAccording to the Fick principle:\n$$CMRO_2 = F \\times (C_a - C_v)$$\nwhere:\n-   $F$ is the rate of blood flow through the $100 \\text{ g}$ of brain tissue, in units of $\\frac{\\mathrm{mL~blood}}{\\mathrm{min}}$.\n-   $C_a$ is the concentration of oxygen in arterial blood, in units of $\\frac{\\mathrm{mL~O}_2}{\\mathrm{mL~blood}}$.\n-   $C_v$ is the concentration of oxygen in venous blood, in units of $\\frac{\\mathrm{mL~O}_2}{\\mathrm{mL~blood}}$.\n\nThe given Cerebral Blood Flow ($CBF$) is $50 \\frac{\\mathrm{mL~blood}}{100~\\mathrm{g~brain} \\cdot \\mathrm{min}}$. For our chosen mass of $100 \\text{ g}$, the flow rate $F$ is therefore:\n$$F = 50 \\frac{\\mathrm{mL~blood}}{\\mathrm{min}}$$\n\nThe arterial and venous oxygen contents, $CaO_2$ and $CvO_2$, are given in units of $\\frac{\\mathrm{mL~O}_2}{\\mathrm{dL~blood}}$. To use them in the Fick equation above, we must convert them to concentrations per milliliter of blood. The conversion relies on the definition $1 \\text{ dL} = 100 \\text{ mL}$.\n\nThe arterial oxygen concentration $C_a$ is:\n$$C_a = \\frac{CaO_2}{100 \\frac{\\mathrm{mL~blood}}{\\mathrm{dL~blood}}} = \\frac{20 \\frac{\\mathrm{mL~O}_2}{\\mathrm{dL~blood}}}{100 \\frac{\\mathrm{mL~blood}}{\\mathrm{dL~blood}}} = 0.20 \\frac{\\mathrm{mL~O}_2}{\\mathrm{mL~blood}}$$\n\nThe venous oxygen concentration $C_v$ is:\n$$C_v = \\frac{CvO_2}{100 \\frac{\\mathrm{mL~blood}}{\\mathrm{dL~blood}}} = \\frac{14 \\frac{\\mathrm{mL~O}_2}{\\mathrm{dL~blood}}}{100 \\frac{\\mathrm{mL~blood}}{\\mathrm{dL~blood}}} = 0.14 \\frac{\\mathrm{mL~O}_2}{\\mathrm{mL~blood}}$$\n\nNow we can derive the final expression for $CMRO_2$ in terms of the given variables. Substituting the expressions for $F$, $C_a$, and $C_v$ into the Fick equation:\n$$CMRO_2 = CBF \\times \\left( \\frac{CaO_2}{100} - \\frac{CvO_2}{100} \\right)$$\nThis simplifies to the general expression:\n$$CMRO_2 = \\frac{CBF \\times (CaO_2 - CvO_2)}{100}$$\nIn this equation, $CBF$ is in units of $\\frac{\\mathrm{mL~blood}}{100~\\mathrm{g~brain} \\cdot \\mathrm{min}}$, while $CaO_2$ and $CvO_2$ are in $\\frac{\\mathrm{mL~O}_2}{\\mathrm{dL~blood}}$.

Therefore, the numerical value is $3.00$.\n\nFinally, we assess if this value is consistent with normal adult cerebral oxygen metabolism at normothermia. The typical range for $CMRO_2$ in a healthy, resting, awake adult is approximately $3.0$ to $3.8 \\frac{\\mathrm{mL~O}_2}{100~\\mathrm{g~brain} \\cdot \\mathrm{min}}$.
