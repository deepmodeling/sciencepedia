All necessary data and definitions are provided, and the requested calculations follow established principles in biostatistics and pediatric growth assessment. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe task is to determine a child's Body Mass Index (BMI), estimate his BMI-for-age percentile, convert this percentile to a $z$-score, and classify his weight status.\n\nFirst, we calculate the child's BMI using the provided formula and data.\nThe BMI is defined as:\n$$ \\mathrm{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight}}{\\text{height}^{2}} $$\nThe given data for the child are a weight $W = 54.3375 \\, \\text{kg}$ and a height $H = 1.50 \\, \\text{m}$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula yields:\n$$ \\mathrm{BMI} = \\frac{54.3375}{ (1.50)^2 } = \\frac{54.3375}{2.25} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{BMI} = 24.15 \\, \\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{m}^2} $$\n\nSecond, we estimate the child's BMI-for-age percentile, $p$. The calculated BMI of $24.15$ lies between the given reference values for the $85$th percentile ($\\mathrm{BMI}_{0.85} = 22.8$) and the $95$th percentile ($\\mathrm{BMI}_{0.95} = 25.5$). The problem states to use linear interpolation to estimate the percentile.\n\nLet the percentile $p$ be a function of BMI. We have two points on this presumed line: $(x_1, p_1) = (22.8, 0.85)$ and $(x_2, p_2) = (25.5, 0.95)$. We want to find the percentile $p$ corresponding to the child's BMI, $x = 24.15$. The equation for linear interpolation is:\n$$ p(x) = p_1 + (x - x_1) \\frac{p_2 - p_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$ p = 0.85 + (24.15 - 22.8) \\frac{0.95 - 0.85}{25.5 - 22.8} $$\n$$ p = 0.85 + (1.35) \\frac{0.10}{2.7} $$\n$$ p = 0.85 + \\frac{0.135}{2.7} $$\n$$ p = 0.85 + 0.05 $$\n$$ p = 0.90 $$\nThus, the child's estimated BMI-for-age is at the $90$th percentile.\n\nThird, we compute the BMI-for-age $z$-score. A $z$-score represents the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean of a standard normal distribution. It is calculated by applying the inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF), $\\Phi^{-1}$, to the percentile $p$.\n$$ z = \\Phi^{-1}(p) $$\nSubstituting the calculated percentile $p = 0.90$:\n$$ z = \\Phi^{-1}(0.90) $$\nUsing standard statistical tables or a computational tool, the value of $\\Phi^{-1}(0.90)$ is approximately $1.281551567...$. The problem requires rounding this value to four significant figures.\n$$ z \\approx 1.282 $$\n\nFourth, we classify the child's weight status based on the provided CDC definitions and the calculated percentile $p=0.90$. The classifications are:\n- Overweight: $0.85 \\leq p < 0.95$, corresponding to code $1$.\n- Obese: $p \\geq 0.95$, corresponding to code $2$.\n\nOur calculated percentile is $p = 0.90$. This value satisfies the inequality $0.85 \\leq 0.90 < 0.95$. Therefore, the child is classified as overweight, and the corresponding classification code is $1$.\n\nThe final answer requires a two-entry row matrix containing the rounded $z$-score and the classification code.
