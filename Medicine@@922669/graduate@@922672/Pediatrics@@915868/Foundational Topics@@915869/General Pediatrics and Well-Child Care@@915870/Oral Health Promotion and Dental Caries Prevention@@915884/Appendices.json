From our calculation, $t_c = 5\\ln(\\frac{6}{5})$. The inequality $pH(t) < 5.5$ is satisfied for $t < t_c$.\n\nThe problem states that the model is valid for $t \\geq 0$. We must check if the demineralization period starts at $t=0$.\nAt $t=0$, $pH(0) = 7 - 1.8\\exp(0) = 7 - 1.8 = 5.2$.\nSince $5.2 < 5.5$, the pH is below the critical threshold at the very beginning of the episode.\nThe function $pH(t)$ is monotonically increasing for $t \\geq 0$, as the term $-1.8\\exp(-t/5)$ increases with $t$. Therefore, the pH will be below $5.5$ for the entire interval from $t=0$ up to the time $t_c$ when it reaches $5.5$.\n\nThe total time for which demineralization occurs is the length of the interval $[0, t_c)$. This duration is $t_c - 0 = t_c = 5\\ln(\\frac{6}{5})$ minutes.\nThe problem asks for this cumulative time over the interval $[0,20]$. We need to ensure that $t_c$ is within this interval.\nUsing $\\ln(1.2)$, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$t_c = 5\\ln(1.2) \\approx 5 \\times 0.18232155679 \\approx 0.91160778 \\text{ minutes}$$\nSince $0.91160778 < 20$, the entire demineralization period is contained within the observation interval $[0, 20]$. Thus, the cumulative time below the critical threshold is indeed $t_c$.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$t_c \\approx 0.9116 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret the implication of this result.\nThe computed duration of demineralization is approximately $0.9116$ minutes, which is less than one minute. Dental caries is a chronic disease process that results from a long-term imbalance where cumulative demineralization exceeds cumulative remineralization. A single, isolated acidogenic challenge of such a short duration is clinically insignificant. Under the specified \"otherwise normal salivary conditions,\" saliva provides a robust defense mechanism. Its buffering agents (like bicarbonate) neutralize the acid, and its supersaturation with calcium and phosphate ions promotes the remineralization of the enamel surface once the pH rises above the critical value of $5.5$. The period of remineralization following this brief acid attack would be substantially longer and more than sufficient to repair any minuscule mineral loss that occurred. Therefore, an isolated event of this nature poses a negligible risk for the initiation of a new carious lesion. The disease of caries arises from frequent and/or prolonged pH drops that overwhelm the mouth's natural repair capacity over time.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9116}$$", "id": "5178490"}, {"introduction": "While the Stephan curve describes the core mechanism, a patient's actual risk of developing caries is multifactorial, involving diet, hygiene, salivary function, and even socioeconomic context.

It adopts a linear scoring framework that aggregates normalized risk components for each determinant into a single dimensionless score on a $0$ to $100$ scale, with higher values indicating higher risk. The following definitions and measurement ranges are prescribed by the clinic’s policy and are consistent with well-tested facts in cariology and pediatric dentistry:\n\n- Diet frequency is captured as the number of daily exposures to fermentable carbohydrate, denoted $E$ (units: exposures per day). The diet risk component is $D = \\min\\!\\left(\\frac{E}{6},\\,1\\right)$, reflecting that at approximately $6$ or more daily exposures the diet-related risk saturates.\n\n- Fluoride exposure is captured using toothbrushing frequency $t$ (units: brushings per day) and toothpaste fluoride concentration $C$ (units: parts per million). The effective fluoride exposure index is $F_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\min\\!\\left(\\frac{t\\,C}{1500},\\,1\\right)$, and the fluoride risk component is $R_{F} = 1 - F_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, reflecting the protective effect of fluoride.\n\n- Stimulated salivary flow is measured as $S$ (units: $\\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}}$). Normal pediatric stimulated flow is approximated by a reference of $1\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}}$ or above. The salivary risk component is $R_{S} = \\max\\!\\left(1 - \\frac{S}{1},\\,0\\right)$, reflecting increased risk as flow falls below the reference.\n\n- Plaque accumulation is measured by the Silness–Löe plaque index $P$ on a $0$ to $3$ scale.
