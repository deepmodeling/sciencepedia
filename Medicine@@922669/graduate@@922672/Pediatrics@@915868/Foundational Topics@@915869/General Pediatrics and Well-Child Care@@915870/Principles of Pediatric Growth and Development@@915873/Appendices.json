In this framework, anthropometric measures are modeled so that, after an appropriate power transformation, the distribution is approximately Gaussian with a location parameter equal to the median and a scale parameter capturing dispersion. For the age-sex stratum corresponding to this child, a validated reference set provides the following parameters: $L=-0.300$, $M=12.2$ kilograms, and $S=0.090$. The child’s measured weight is $9.8$ kilograms.\n\nStarting from the fundamental idea that a Box–Cox power transformation can be used to normalize skewed biological measures and that standardization to a $Z$-score is achieved by centering by the transformed location and scaling by the transformed dispersion, derive the appropriate expression for the weight-for-age $Z$-score for the case of nonzero $L$, and compute the child’s $Z$-score using the provided $L$, $M$, and $S$.\n\nAfter computing the $Z$-score, assess how it compares with the conventional classification thresholds at $Z=-2$, $Z=-3$, and $Z=+2$ in terms of whether it falls below, between, or above these values.

This is achieved through a Box-Cox power transformation. For a given measurement $Y$ at a specific age, the method uses three parameters: $M$ (the median), $S$ (the coefficient of variation), and $L$ (the skewness parameter, which is the power of the Box-Cox transformation).\n\nThe relationship between a measurement $Y$ and its corresponding standard normal deviate, or $Z$-score, is defined by the centile equation. For a value of $L$ not equal to zero, this equation is:\n$$ Y = M (1 + L S Z)^{\\frac{1}{L}} $$\nHere, $Y$ is the child's measurement, and $Z$ is the $Z$-score we wish to determine. The parameters $L$, $M$, and $S$ are given for the child's specific age and sex.\n\nTo derive the expression for the $Z$-score, we must algebraically rearrange this equation to solve for $Z$. The derivation proceeds as follows:\n\nFirst, divide both sides by the median, $M$:\n$$ \\frac{Y}{M} = (1 + L S Z)^{\\frac{1}{L}} $$\nNext, to eliminate the fractional exponent, raise both sides to the power of $L$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{Y}{M}\\right)^L = \\left((1 + L S Z)^{\\frac{1}{L}}\\right)^L $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{Y}{M}\\right)^L = 1 + L S Z $$\nNow, isolate the term containing $Z$ by subtracting $1$ from both sides:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{Y}{M}\\right)^L - 1 = L S Z $$\nFinally, divide by the product $L S$ to solve for $Z$. This step is valid because the problem specifies the case where $L$ is nonzero ($L=-0.300$).\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{Y}{M}\\right)^L - 1}{L S} $$\nThis is the required expression for the weight-for-age $Z$-score when $L \\neq 0$.\n\nNow, we can compute the child's $Z$-score using the provided data:\n- Child's measured weight, $Y = 9.8$ kilograms.\n- Median weight for the age-sex stratum, $M = 12.2$ kilograms.\n- Skewness parameter, $L = -0.300$.\n- Coefficient of variation, $S = 0.090$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{9.8}{12.2}\\right)^{-0.300} - 1}{(-0.300)(0.090)} $$\nFirst, calculate the ratio of the child's weight to the median weight:\n$$ \\frac{Y}{M} = \\frac{9.8}{12.2} \\approx 0.8032786885 $$\nNext, apply the Box-Cox transformation by raising this ratio to the power of $L$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{Y}{M}\\right)^L \\approx (0.8032786885)^{-0.300} \\approx 1.06794025 $$\nNow, substitute this result into the numerator of the $Z$-score equation:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = 1.06794025 - 1 = 0.06794025 $$\nThen, calculate the denominator:\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = L S = (-0.300)(0.090) = -0.027 $$\nFinally, compute the $Z$-score by dividing the numerator by the denominator:\n$$ Z = \\frac{0.06794025}{-0.027} \\approx -2.5163055... $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ Z \\approx -2.516 $$\nThis $Z$-score indicates that the child's weight is approximately $2.516$ standard deviations below the median weight for his age and sex, after accounting for the skewness of the reference distribution.
