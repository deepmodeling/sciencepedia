It is a valid, well-posed problem in physiological modeling.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be generated.\n\n***\n\n**1) Derivation of the Governing Differential Equation**\n\nThe problem starts from the principle of conservation of mass for the stored milk volume, $M(t)$. This principle can be written as a rate equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of synthesis inflow}) - (\\text{Rate of net depletion})\n$$\nWe are given linear response approximations for the rates on the right-hand side.\nThe synthesis inflow is stated to be proportional to the suckling stimulus, $S$, with a proportionality constant $\\alpha$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of synthesis inflow} = \\alpha S\n$$\nThe net depletion effect, which combines removal by the infant and autocrine feedback inhibition, is stated to scale with the stored volume, $M$, with a proportionality constant $\\beta$. Thus:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of net depletion} = \\beta M(t)\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the mass balance equation yields the governing first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = \\alpha S - \\beta M(t)\n$$\nThis is the required differential equation.\n\n**2) Solution of the Differential Equation**\n\nThe ODE can be rewritten in standard form for a first-order linear equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} + \\beta M = \\alpha S\n$$\nThis is a non-homogeneous equation. We can solve it using an integrating factor, $I(t)$. The integrating factor is given by:\n$$\nI(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int \\beta \\, dt\\right) = \\exp(\\beta t)\n$$\nMultiplying the entire ODE by $I(t)$:\n$$\n\\exp(\\beta t)\\frac{dM}{dt} + \\beta \\exp(\\beta t) M = \\alpha S \\exp(\\beta t)\n$$\nThe left side of the equation is the result of the product rule for differentiation, specifically $\\frac{d}{dt}\\left[M(t) \\exp(\\beta t)\\right]$.\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left[M(t) \\exp(\\beta t)\\right] = \\alpha S \\exp(\\beta t)\n$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{d}{dt}\\left[M(t) \\exp(\\beta t)\\right] dt = \\int \\alpha S \\exp(\\beta t) dt\n$$\n$$\nM(t) \\exp(\\beta t) = \\alpha S \\int \\exp(\\beta t) dt\n$$\nSince $\\alpha$, $S$, and $\\beta$ are constants:\n$$\nM(t) \\exp(\\beta t) = \\frac{\\alpha S}{\\beta} \\exp(\\beta t) + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. To find the general solution for $M(t)$, we divide by $\\exp(\\beta t)$:\n$$\nM(t) = \\frac{\\alpha S}{\\beta} + C \\exp(-\\beta t)\n$$\nWe now apply the initial condition $M(0) = M_0$ to determine $C$.\n$$\nM(0) = M_0 = \\frac{\\alpha S}{\\beta} + C \\exp(-0) = \\frac{\\alpha S}{\\beta} + C\n$$\nSolving for $C$:\n$$\nC = M_0 - \\frac{\\alpha S}{\\beta}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $C$ back into the general solution gives the specific solution for the initial value problem:\n$$\nM(t) = \\frac{\\alpha S}{\\beta} + \\left(M_0 - \\frac{\\alpha S}{\\beta}\\right) \\exp(-\\beta t)\n$$\n\n**3) Steady-State Analysis and Physiological Interpretation**\n\nThe steady-state storage volume, $M_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, is the volume at which the system is in equilibrium, meaning the milk volume is no longer changing. This occurs when $\\frac{dM}{dt} = 0$. Using the governing ODE:\n$$\n0 = \\alpha S - \\beta M_{\\mathrm{ss}}\n$$\nSolving for $M_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{\\alpha S}{\\beta}\n$$\nAlternatively, the steady state is the limit of $M(t)$ as $t \\to \\infty$. Since $\\beta  0$, the exponential term $\\exp(-\\beta t)$ approaches $0$ as $t$ becomes very large.\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} M(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[\\frac{\\alpha S}{\\beta} + \\left(M_0 - \\frac{\\alpha S}{\\beta}\\right) \\exp(-\\beta t)\\right] = \\frac{\\alpha S}{\\beta}\n$$\nPhysiological interpretation:\n- The steady-state volume $M_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is directly proportional to the suckling stimulus $S$. This aligns with the well-established principle that milk production rises to meet infant demand. A higher or more frequent suckling stimulus signals a greater need, leading to a higher equilibrium level of stored milk.\n- The steady-state volume $M_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is inversely proportional to the autocrine feedback/removal constant $\\beta$. The parameter $\\beta$ represents the strength of the inhibitory signal sent by stored milk (autocrine control) and the efficiency of milk removal. A large $\\beta$ means that even a small amount of stored milk strongly inhibits further synthesis, or that milk is removed very efficiently, resulting in a lower steady-state volume. This correctly models the physiological mechanism that prevents continuous, unchecked milk accumulation.\n\n**4) Numerical Computation of Steady-State Volume**\n\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n- $\\alpha = 2\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{AU}^{-1}$\n- $\\beta = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- $S = 12\\,\\mathrm{AU}$\n\nUsing the derived formula for the steady-state volume:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{\\alpha S}{\\beta}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{(2\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{AU}^{-1}) \\times (12\\,\\mathrm{AU})}{0.12\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{24\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1}}{0.12\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{24}{0.12}\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 200\\,\\mathrm{mL}\n$$\nThe problem requests the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact result is $200$. As a three-significant-figure number, this is $200$.

The use of percentile charts for risk stratification is standard clinical practice. The kinetic model relating bilirubin levels to enteral intake is a plausible biophysical simplification, appropriate for a modeling problem. All provided values, such as the infant's weight, feeding volumes, and bilirubin levels, are realistic. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear initial condition, a dynamic model, a target constraint, and asking for a specific parameter to meet that constraint. The language is objective and the problem is self-contained. There are no contradictions, missing data, or scientific fallacies.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe first step is to assess the neonate's risk level at the initial measurement time of $t=36$ hours. The total serum bilirubin is $B(36) = 11.2$ mg/dL. The given percentile boundaries are $P_{75}(36) = 10.5$ mg/dL and $P_{95}(36) = 13.5$ mg/dL. Since $10.5  11.2  13.5$, the infant's bilirubin level is in the high-intermediate risk zone. The problem requests linear interpolation to estimate the percentile, $p$.\n$$p(B) = p_1 + (p_2-p_1)\\frac{B-B_1}{B_2-B_1}$$\nSubstituting the given values for $t=36$ hours:\n$$p(11.2) = 75 + (95-75)\\frac{11.2-10.5}{13.5-10.5} = 75 + 20 \\frac{0.7}{3.0} = 75 + \\frac{14}{3} \\approx 79.7$$\nThe infant's TSB is at approximately the $80$th percentile, justifying an intervention to prevent excessive hyperbilirubinemia.\n\nThe goal is to determine the minimum supplemental feeding volume, $x$, required to ensure the TSB at $t=48$ hours does not exceed the $75$th percentile at that age. The target condition is $B(48) \\le P_{75}(48)$, which is $B(48) \\le 12.0$ mg/dL.\n\nWe use the provided discrete evolution model for bilirubin concentration:\n$$B(t+\\Delta t)\\approx B(t)+s(V_{\\text{tot}})\\,\\Delta t$$\nHere, the initial time is $t=36$ hours and the final time is $t+\\Delta t = 48$ hours, so the time interval is $\\Delta t = 12$ hours. The initial bilirubin level is $B(36) = 11.2$ mg/dL. We set the condition:\n$$B(36) + s(V_{\\text{tot}})\\,\\Delta t \\le P_{75}(48)$$\n$$11.2 + s(V_{\\text{tot}}) \\times 12 \\le 12.0$$\nNow, we solve for the maximum allowable rate of rise, $s(V_{\\text{tot}})$:\n$$12 \\cdot s(V_{\\text{tot}}) \\le 12.0 - 11.2$$\n$$12 \\cdot s(V_{\\text{tot}}) \\le 0.8$$\n$$s(V_{\\text{tot}}) \\le \\frac{0.8}{12} = \\frac{8/10}{12} = \\frac{8}{120} = \\frac{1}{15}\\ \\text{mg/dL}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1}$$\nThe rate of bilirubin increase, $s(V_{\\text{tot}})$, is a decreasing function of the total enteral intake, $V_{\\text{tot}}$. To ensure $s(V_{\\text{tot}})$ is at or below the required maximum, the intake $V_{\\text{tot}}$ must be at or above a certain minimum value. We now use the formula for $s(V_{\\text{tot}})$:\n$$s(V_{\\text{tot}}) = s_{\\min}+\\bigl(s_{\\max}-s_{\\min}\\bigr)\\exp(-\\gamma V_{\\text{tot}})$$\nSubstituting the given parameter values:\n$$0.04 + (0.12 - 0.04)\\exp(-0.015 V_{\\text{tot}}) \\le \\frac{1}{15}$$\n$$0.04 + 0.08\\exp(-0.015 V_{\\text{tot}}) \\le \\frac{1}{15}$$\nIsolating the exponential term:\n$$0.08\\exp(-0.015 V_{\\text{tot}}) \\le \\frac{1}{15} - 0.04 = \\frac{1}{15} - \\frac{4}{100} = \\frac{1}{15} - \\frac{1}{25}$$\nThe common denominator of $15$ and $25$ is $75$.\n$$0.08\\exp(-0.015 V_{\\text{tot}}) \\le \\frac{5}{75} - \\frac{3}{75} = \\frac{2}{75}$$\n$$\\exp(-0.015 V_{\\text{tot}}) \\le \\frac{2}{75 \\times 0.08} = \\frac{2}{75 \\times (8/100)} = \\frac{200}{75 \\times 8} = \\frac{200}{600} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nTo solve for $V_{\\text{tot}}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. Since $\\ln(y)$ is an increasing function, the inequality direction is preserved.\n$$\\ln\\bigl(\\exp(-0.015 V_{\\text{tot}})\\bigr) \\le \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)$$\n$$-0.015 V_{\\text{tot}} \\le -\\ln(3)$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality:\n$$0.015 V_{\\text{tot}} \\ge \\ln(3)$$\nThis gives the minimum required daily enteral intake normalized to body weight:\n$$V_{\\text{tot}} \\ge \\frac{\\ln(3)}{0.015}\\ \\text{mL}\\cdot\\text{kg}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{day}^{-1}$$\nNow, we relate this minimum required intake to the supplemental volume $x$ using the given formula for $V_{\\text{tot}}(x)$:\n$$V_{\\text{tot}}(x) = \\frac{(8+x) \\times 12}{3.20}$$\nWe set this to be greater than or equal to the minimum required value:\n$$\\frac{12(8+x)}{3.20} \\ge \\frac{\\ln(3)}{0.015}$$\nNow we solve for $x$, which represents the minimum required supplemental volume per feed.\n$$8+x \\ge \\frac{3.20}{12} \\times \\frac{\\ln(3)}{0.015}$$\n$$x \\ge \\left( \\frac{3.20 \\times \\ln(3)}{12 \\times 0.015} \\right) - 8$$\nLet's simplify the coefficient:\n$$x \\ge \\left( \\frac{3.20 \\ln(3)}{0.18} \\right) - 8 = \\left( \\frac{320 \\ln(3)}{18} \\right) - 8 = \\frac{160 \\ln(3)}{9} - 8$$\nThis is the exact analytical expression for the minimum required value of $x$. To find the numerical answer, we use the value of $\\ln(3) \\approx 1.0986122887$:\n$$x \\ge \\frac{160 \\times 1.0986122887}{9} - 8$$\n$$x \\ge \\frac{175.777966...}{9} - 8$$\n$$x \\ge 19.530885... - 8$$\n$$x \\ge 11.530885...$$\nThe problem asks to round the answer to three significant figures.\n$$x_{\\min} \\approx 11.5\\ \\text{mL per feed}$$\nTherefore, a minimum supplemental volume of $11.5$ mL per feed is required to meet the therapeutic goal.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{11.5}\n$$", "id": "5111010"}]}
