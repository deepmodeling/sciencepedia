In SBIRT, quantifying alcohol intake consistently across beverage types relies on the concept of a standard drink unit: a fixed mass of ethanol, independent of beverage volume or concentration. Using first principles—mass balance, hydrophilicity of ethanol, distribution into total body water, and zero-order hepatic elimination—derive a method to estimate blood alcohol concentration (BAC) as grams per deciliter from a drinking pattern reported by the adolescent. Then apply your derivation to the following scientifically realistic scenario.\n\nAssumptions and foundational facts (do not use any shortcut formulas that jump to the final result without derivation):\n- Ethanol has density $\\rho_{\\text{EtOH}} = 0.789\\,\\text{g/mL}$.\n- Alcohol by volume (ABV) is a volumetric fraction, so the volume of ethanol in a beverage of volume $V$ and ABV $a$ is $a V$.\n- For a first-pass estimate shortly after drinking begins, assume complete absorption and instantaneous distribution across total body water.\n- The apparent volume of distribution for ethanol in an adolescent can be approximated by a sex-specific total body water factor $r$ (liters per kilogram), so the distribution volume is $r W$, where $W$ is body mass in kilograms.\n- Elimination is modeled as zero-order with rate $\\beta$ in $\\text{g/dL/hour}$ over the time window considered.\n\nCase: A 16-year-old female with body mass $W = 55\\,\\text{kg}$ begins drinking at time $t=0$ and is assessed at $t = 1.25\\,\\text{hours}$.

It provides all necessary data and assumptions to derive a solution from first principles, as requested. The scenario is a standard application of pharmacokinetic modeling for ethanol.

The derivation will proceed from first principles as stipulated.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total mass of ethanol ingested.**\n\nThe mass of ethanol, $m_{\\text{EtOH}}$, in any given beverage is the product of its volume of ethanol, $V_{\\text{EtOH}}$, and the density of ethanol, $\\rho_{\\text{EtOH}}$. The volume of ethanol is determined by the beverage's total volume, $V$, and its alcohol by volume fraction, $a$.\n\nFor a single beverage $i$ with volume $V_i$ and ABV $a_i$, the volume of ethanol is:\n$$V_{\\text{EtOH},i} = a_i V_i$$\nThe mass of ethanol in this beverage is:\n$$m_{\\text{EtOH},i} = \\rho_{\\text{EtOH}} V_{\\text{EtOH},i} = \\rho_{\\text{EtOH}} a_i V_i$$\n\nThe total mass of ethanol ingested, $M_{\\text{EtOH}}$, is the sum of the masses from all beverages consumed:\n$$M_{\\text{EtOH}} = \\sum_i m_{\\text{EtOH},i} = \\rho_{\\text{EtOH}} \\sum_i (a_i V_i)$$\n\nThe beverage volumes are given in fluid ounces ($\\text{fl oz}$), while the density is in grams per milliliter ($\\text{g/mL}$). We must use a conversion factor, $k = 29.5735\\,\\text{mL/fl oz}$, to ensure consistent units.\nThe volumes in $\\text{mL}$ for the three beverages are:\n$V_{1,\\text{mL}} = 16\\,\\text{fl oz} \\times k$\n$V_{2,\\text{mL}} = 8\\,\\text{fl oz} \\times k$\n$V_{3,\\text{mL}} = 2\\,\\text{fl oz} \\times k$\n\nLet's calculate the total volume of pure ethanol in $\\text{mL}$:\n$V_{\\text{EtOH,total}} = (a_1 V_1 + a_2 V_2 + a_3 V_3) \\times k$\n$V_{\\text{EtOH,total}} = (0.07 \\times 16 + 0.05 \\times 8 + 0.40 \\times 2)\\,\\text{fl oz} \\times k$\n$V_{\\text{EtOH,total}} = (1.12 + 0.40 + 0.80)\\,\\text{fl oz} \\times k = 2.32\\,\\text{fl oz} \\times 29.5735\\,\\text{mL/fl oz}$\n$V_{\\text{EtOH,total}} \\approx 68.61052\\,\\text{mL}$\n\nNow, we calculate the total mass of ethanol using its density, $\\rho_{\\text{EtOH}} = 0.789\\,\\text{g/mL}$:\n$M_{\\text{EtOH}} = \\rho_{\\text{EtOH}} V_{\\text{EtOH,total}} = 0.789\\,\\text{g/mL} \\times 68.61052\\,\\text{mL}$\n$M_{\\text{EtOH}} \\approx 54.1337\\,\\text{g}$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the apparent volume of distribution.**\n\nEthanol distributes into the total body water.

This means the concentration decreases linearly with time. The BAC at time $t$, $C(t)$, is given by:\n$$C(t) = C_0 - \\beta t$$\nThis equation holds for $t > 0$, as long as $C(t) \\ge 0$.\n\nCombining the expressions for $M_{\\text{EtOH}}$, $V_d$, and $C_0$, we obtain the fully derived analytic expression for $C(t)$:\n$$C(t) = \\frac{\\rho_{\\text{EtOH}} k \\sum_i (a_i V_i)}{10 r W} - \\beta t$$\nwhere volumes $V_i$ are in $\\text{fl oz}$, $W$ is in $\\text{kg}$, $\\rho_{\\text{EtOH}}$ is in $\\text{g/mL}$, $k$ is in $\\text{mL/fl oz}$, $r$ is in $\\text{L/kg}$, $\\beta$ is in $\\text{g/dL/hour}$, $t$ is in hours, and the factor of $10$ converts liters to deciliters.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the BAC for the specific case.**\n\nWe need to calculate the BAC at time $t = 1.25\\,\\text{hours}$. The elimination rate is given as $\\beta = 0.015\\,\\text{g/dL/hour}$.\nThe total decrease in concentration due to elimination is:\n$\\Delta C_{\\text{elim}} = \\beta t = 0.015\\,\\text{g/dL/hour} \\times 1.25\\,\\text{hours} = 0.01875\\,\\text{g/dL}$\n\nNow, we subtract this from the initial peak concentration $C_0$:\n$C(1.25) = C_0 - \\beta t$\n$C(1.25) = 0.178954\\,\\text{g/dL} - 0.01875\\,\\text{g/dL}$\n$C(1.25) = 0.160204\\,\\text{g/dL}$\n\nThe problem requests the final answer rounded to three significant figures.\n$C(1.25) \\approx 0.160\\,\\text{g/dL}$\n\nThis final value represents the estimated BAC for the $16$-year-old female $1.25$ hours after she began drinking, based on the provided pharmacokinetic model and parameters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.160}$$", "id": "5099033"}, {"introduction": "A screening tool's sensitivity and specificity describe its intrinsic accuracy, but they don't answer the most pressing clinical question: given a patient's test result, what is the likelihood they have the disorder?

Nearly half ($1 - 0.5136 = 0.4864$ or about $48.6\\%$) of the positive results are false positives. Therefore, every positive screen warrants a brief intervention and further clinical assessment to confirm the diagnosis before considering a referral to specialized treatment.

This means that among adolescents who test negative, there is a $98.62\\%$ probability that they do not have a moderate-to-severe SUD. This very high $NPV$ is clinically extremely useful. It indicates that a negative test result is highly reliable for ruling out the condition. Clinicians can be very confident that an adolescent with a negative screen is unlikely to have a moderate-to-severe SUD, allowing them to efficiently focus their limited time and resources on the higher-risk, screen-positive group.

Therefore, there is no tie, and the single threshold that maximizes Youden's index is $c=2$.\n\n**4) Interpretation**\nThe Area Under the Curve (AUC) of approximately 0.84 indicates that the CRAFFT screen has good discriminatory power in this population; it is substantially better at distinguishing between SUD-positive and SUD-negative adolescents than a random guess (AUC=0.5).\nThe optimal cutoff of $c=2$, identified by maximizing Youden's index, provides the best balance between correctly identifying adolescents with SUD (sensitivity ≈ 88%) and correctly identifying those without SUD (specificity ≈ 67%). In a clinical setting, this means that a CRAFFT score of 2 or higher should trigger a brief intervention and further assessment. This strategy maximizes the test's ability to find true cases while keeping the number of false positives at a level that is statistically optimal for this population's score distribution. The high sensitivity at this cutoff aligns with the clinical preference to avoid missing cases, as the subsequent brief intervention is low-risk and beneficial even for those at lower risk levels.\n\nBased on the analysis in step 3, the selected cutoff $c$ is 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "5099072"}]}
