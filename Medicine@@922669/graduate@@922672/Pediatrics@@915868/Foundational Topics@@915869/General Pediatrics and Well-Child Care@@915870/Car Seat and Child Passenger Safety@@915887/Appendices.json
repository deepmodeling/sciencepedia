The provided conversion factor is the exact international standard. The problem is well-posed, with a clear objective and all necessary data provided to compute a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a straightforward application of unit conversion and algebra to a real-world safety standard.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires determining the maximum allowable mass of a child, $m_{child, max}$, for which the lower anchors can be used for installation of the given Child Restraint System (CRS). This maximum mass also represents the threshold at or above which the installation method must be changed to the vehicle's seat belt plus top tether.\n\nThe governing principle is that the sum of the child's mass and the CRS mass must not exceed the specified lower anchor combined mass limit. This is expressed by the inequality:\n$$m_{child} + m_{CRS} \\le M_{limit}$$\n\nThe given mass of the CRS is $m_{CRS} = 9\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\nThe given combined mass limit is $M_{limit, lb} = 65\\ \\mathrm{lb}$.\n\nTo maintain unit consistency within the International System of Units (SI), the mass limit must be converted from pounds ($lb$) to kilograms ($kg$). The exact conversion factor is provided as $1\\ \\mathrm{lb} = 0.45359237\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\nLet $k$ be the conversion factor, so $k = 0.45359237\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kg}}{\\mathrm{lb}}$.\nThe mass limit in kilograms, $M_{limit, kg}$, is calculated as:\n$$M_{limit, kg} = M_{limit, lb} \\times k = 65\\ \\mathrm{lb} \\times 0.45359237\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kg}}{\\mathrm{lb}}$$\n$$M_{limit, kg} = 29.48350405\\ \\mathrm{kg}$$\n\nThe maximum allowable child mass, $m_{child, max}$, is found when the combined mass equals the limit. We can express this by setting the inequality to an equality:\n$$m_{child, max} + m_{CRS} = M_{limit, kg}$$\n\nWe can now solve for $m_{child, max}$ by rearranging the equation:\n$$m_{child, max} = M_{limit, kg} - m_{CRS}$$\n\nSubstituting the known values in kilograms:\n$$m_{child, max} = 29.48350405\\ \\mathrm{kg} - 9\\ \\mathrm{kg}$$\n$$m_{child, max} = 20.48350405\\ \\mathrm{kg}$$\n\nThis value, $m_{child, max}$, is the maximum mass a child can have for the lower anchor installation to be compliant. Any child with a mass at or above this threshold value would cause the combined mass to exceed the limit if their mass is even infinitesimally greater. Therefore, this value represents the mass threshold at which the transition to a seat belt installation is required.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $20.48350405\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\nThe first four significant figures are $2$, $0$, $4$, and $8$. The fifth significant figure is $3$.

Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213 is the U.S. federal standard for child restraint systems.

It is a valid, well-defined problem rooted in established scientific and engineering principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to calculate the effectiveness of a top tether, defined as the fractional reduction in maximum forward head excursion. This analysis will be grounded in the mechanical principles of the system.\n\nIn a frontal impact, the vehicle undergoes rapid deceleration. By Newton's first law, the CRS and the occupant within it will continue to move forward relative to the vehicle's interior. The CRS is typically anchored at its base by the vehicle's seat belt or LATCH system. This lower anchorage acts as a pivot.\n\nWithout a top tether, the upper portion of the CRS is free to rotate forward around this pivot point. This rotation contributes significantly to the total forward displacement (excursion) of the test dummy's head. The head excursion, $d$, is a critical measure because excessive forward movement can lead to the head striking components of the vehicle interior, a primary mechanism for serious head injury.\n\nThe top tether is a strap that connects the top of the CRS to a dedicated anchor point in the vehicle. In a crash, as the CRS begins to rotate forward, this tether is placed under tension. This tension force creates a restoring torque that counteracts the forward rotation of the CRS. By limiting this rotation, the top tether mechanically restrains the upper part of the CRS, which in turn reduces the total forward displacement of the occupant's head and torso. The reduction in head excursion from $d_{\\text{untethered}}$ to $d_{\\text{tethered}}$ is a direct physical consequence of this added rotational constraint.\n\nThe problem requires us to quantify this improvement using the specified definition of effectiveness, $E$, as the fractional reduction relative to the baseline (untethered) case.\n\nLet $d_{\\text{untethered}}$ be the head excursion in the baseline configuration (without tether), and let $d_{\\text{tethered}}$ be the head excursion in the test configuration (with tether).\nThe absolute reduction in head excursion, $\\Delta d$, is the difference between the baseline and the test measurement:\n$$ \\Delta d = d_{\\text{untethered}} - d_{\\text{tethered}} $$\n\nThe fractional reduction, $E$, is this absolute reduction divided by the baseline value:\n$$ E = \\frac{\\Delta d}{d_{\\text{untethered}}} = \\frac{d_{\\text{untethered}} - d_{\\text{tethered}}}{d_{\\text{untethered}}} $$\n\nThis formula provides a dimensionless measure of the improvement attributable to the top tether. We are given the following values:\n$$ d_{\\text{untethered}} = 720\\ \\mathrm{mm} $$\n$$ d_{\\text{tethered}} = 610\\ \\mathrm{mm} $$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for effectiveness:\n$$ E = \\frac{720 - 610}{720} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{110}{720} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{11}{72} $$\n\nTo express this as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$ E \\approx 0.152777... $$\n\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$ E \\approx 0.1528 $$\n\nThis result indicates that the use of a top tether reduced the maximum forward head excursion by approximately $15.28\\%$ relative to the untethered configuration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1528}$$", "id": "5112464"}, {"introduction": "Even a perfectly installed car seat can have its safety compromised by real-world factors that introduce slack into the restraint system.

It uses standard physical models (Hooke's Law, Newton's Laws, Work-Energy Theorem) and provides a sufficient and consistent set of parameters. The scenario, while simplified, represents a realistic engineering problem in occupant protection. The term $F_c$ is used to establish the final compression state of the parka, confirming its densification, which is a consistent physical interpretation. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of Residual Slack ($s$)\nFirst, we characterize the parka's elastic behavior. It is modeled as a linear spring governed by Hooke's Law, $F = kx$. The stiffness of the parka, $k_p$, can be calculated from the provided quasi-static test data:\n$$k_p = \\frac{F}{x} = \\frac{500\\ \\mathrm{N}}{15 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{100000}{3}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}$$\nThe caregiver applies a static pre-tension of $F_0 = 60\\ \\mathrm{N}$. The initial compression of the parka, $x_0$, is:\n$$x_0 = \\frac{F_0}{k_p} = \\frac{60\\ \\mathrm{N}}{(100000/3)\\ \\mathrm{N/m}} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m} = 1.8\\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe parka has a maximum compressible thickness (densification limit) of $T_{\\max} = 18\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. We must determine the force required to achieve this maximum compression:\n$$F_{\\text{densify}} = k_p T_{\\max} = \\left(\\frac{100000}{3}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}\\right) \\times (18 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}) = 600\\ \\mathrm{N}$$\nThe problem states that during the crash, the peak belt force reaches $F_c = 2000\\ \\mathrm{N}$. Since $F_c  F_{\\text{densify}}$, the parka will be compressed to its densification limit, $T_{\\max}$. Therefore, the final compression state of the parka, $x_{c, \\text{final}}$, is:\n$$x_{c, \\text{final}} = T_{\\max} = 18\\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe residual slack, $s$, is defined as the additional compression of the parka from its pre-tensioned state to its fully compressed state during the crash.\n$$s = x_{c, \\text{final}} - x_0 = 18\\ \\mathrm{mm} - 1.8\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 16.2\\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\nConverting to SI units for subsequent calculations: $s = 0.0162\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n\n### Step 3: Kinematic Analysis and Maximum Spring Extension ($x_{\\max}$)\nWe analyze the child's motion in the non-inertial reference frame of the vehicle. According to Newton's second law, the constant vehicle deceleration $a$ creates a pseudo-force, $F_{\\text{pseudo}}$, acting on the child's mass $m$:\n$$F_{\\text{pseudo}} = m a = m (20g) = 15\\ \\mathrm{kg} \\times (20 \\times 9.81\\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}) = 2943\\ \\mathrm{N}$$\nThe child's forward motion occurs in two distinct phases as specified:\n1.  **Slack Take-up:** The child moves forward a distance $s$. During this phase, the child is subject only to the pseudo-force. The work done by this force, $W_s$, is converted into the child's kinetic energy, $KE_s$.\n    $$W_s = F_{\\text{pseudo}} \\times s$$\n    $$KE_s = W_s = F_{\\text{pseudo}} s$$\n2.  **Harness Engagement:** After traveling the distance $s$, the harness spring (with stiffness $k_s$) begins to stretch, and the restraint force increases. We use the work-energy theorem to find the maximum additional extension of the harness, $x_{\\max}$. Let the origin for this phase be the point of slack engagement. The initial energy is the kinetic energy $KE_s$. The final state is the point of maximum excursion, where the child's velocity is momentarily zero ($KE_{\\text{final}}=0$) and the spring has stretched by $x_{\\max}$.\n\nThe change in kinetic energy, $\\Delta KE$, must equal the net work done on the mass by all forces.\n$$\\Delta KE = KE_{\\text{final}} - KE_{\\text{initial}} = 0 - F_{\\text{pseudo}} s = - F_{\\text{pseudo}} s$$\nThe net work, $W_{\\text{net}}$, is the sum of the work done by the pseudo-force, $W_{\\text{pseudo}}$, and the work done by the spring force, $W_{\\text{spring}}$, over the displacement $x_{\\max}$.\n$$W_{\\text{pseudo}} = F_{\\text{pseudo}} x_{\\max}$$\n$$W_{\\text{spring}} = -\\int_0^{x_{\\max}} k_s x \\,dx = -\\frac{1}{2} k_s x_{\\max}^2$$\nEquating the net work to the change in kinetic energy:\n$$W_{\\text{net}} = W_{\\text{pseudo}} + W_{\\text{spring}} = \\Delta KE$$\n$$F_{\\text{pseudo}} x_{\\max} - \\frac{1}{2} k_s x_{\\max}^2 = - F_{\\text{pseudo}} s$$\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic equation for $x_{\\max}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} k_s x_{\\max}^2 - F_{\\text{pseudo}} x_{\\max} - F_{\\text{pseudo}} s = 0$$\nSolving for $x_{\\max}$ using the quadratic formula and selecting the positive root for a physical displacement:\n$$x_{\\max} = \\frac{F_{\\text{pseudo}} + \\sqrt{(-F_{\\text{pseudo}})^2 - 4(\\frac{1}{2}k_s)(-F_{\\text{pseudo}}s)}}{2(\\frac{1}{2}k_s)} = \\frac{F_{\\text{pseudo}} + \\sqrt{F_{\\text{pseudo}}^2 + 2k_s F_{\\text{pseudo}}s}}{k_s}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$F_{\\text{pseudo}} = 2943\\ \\mathrm{N}$\n$s = 0.0162\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$k_s = 2.5 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{N/m}$\n\n$$x_{\\max} = \\frac{2943 + \\sqrt{(2943)^2 + 2(2.5 \\times 10^5)(2943)(0.0162)}}{2.5 \\times 10^5}$$\n$$x_{\\max} = \\frac{2943 + \\sqrt{8661249 + 23838300}}{2.5 \\times 10^5} = \\frac{2943 + \\sqrt{32499549}}{2.5 \\times 10^5}$$\n$$x_{\\max} = \\frac{2943 + 5700.8376}{2.5 \\times 10^5} = \\frac{8643.8376}{250000} \\approx 0.03457535\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n$$x_{\\max} \\approx 34.575\\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\n### Step 4: Total Additional Forward Excursion ($\\Delta x$)\nThe total additional forward excursion attributable to the parka, $\\Delta x$, is the sum of the slack distance $s$ and the maximum additional spring extension $x_{\\max}$.\n$$\\Delta x = s + x_{\\max}$$\n$$\\Delta x = 16.2\\ \\mathrm{mm} + 34.57535\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 50.77535\\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$\\Delta x \\approx 50.78\\ \\mathrm{mm}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{50.78}$$", "id": "5112614"}]}
