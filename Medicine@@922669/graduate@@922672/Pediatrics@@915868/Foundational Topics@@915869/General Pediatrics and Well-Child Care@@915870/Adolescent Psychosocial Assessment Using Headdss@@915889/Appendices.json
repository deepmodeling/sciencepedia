Sleep is a vital component of adolescent health with direct links to mood, and this exercise demonstrates how to transform a reported sleep schedule into a cumulative sleep debt [@problem_id:5098100]. By then applying a hypothetical odds-based model, you will practice linking this objective data to a clinical endpoint, sharpening your ability to conduct a data-informed \"Depression/Suicide\" assessment.", "problem": "You are conducting a Home, Education/Employment, Activities, Drugs, Sexuality, Depression/Suicide, Safety (HEADDSS) assessment for a mid-adolescent who reports the following sleep schedule across the five school nights (Sunday night through Thursday night).

It is scientifically grounded in principles of adolescent medicine and biostatistics, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. We can therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the estimated probability of mood dysregulation, $p(D)$, for an adolescent based on their reported sleep schedule and a given odds-based risk model. This requires a multi-step calculation.\n\nFirst, we calculate the nightly sleep duration, $S_i$, for each of the $i=1, \\dots, 5$ school nights. Durations are calculated in hours.\n\n1.  Sunday night ($i=1$): Bed at $22{:}45$, wake at $06{:}20$. The elapsed time is $7$ hours and $35$ minutes. Converting minutes to hours, the duration is $S_1 = 7 + \\frac{35}{60} = 7 + \\frac{7}{12} = \\frac{84+7}{12} = \\frac{91}{12}$ hours.\n\n2.  Monday night ($i=2$): Bed at $00{:}10$, wake at $06{:}00$. The elapsed time is $5$ hours and $50$ minutes. The duration is $S_2 = 5 + \\frac{50}{60} = 5 + \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{30+5}{6} = \\frac{35}{6}$ hours.\n\n3.  Tuesday night ($i=3$): Bed at $23{:}30$, wake at $06{:}30$. The elapsed time is exactly $7$ hours. The duration is $S_3 = 7$ hours.\n\n4.  Wednesday night ($i=4$): Bed at $00{:}50$, wake at $06{:}15$. The elapsed time is $5$ hours and $25$ minutes. The duration is $S_4 = 5 + \\frac{25}{60} = 5 + \\frac{5}{12} = \\frac{60+5}{12} = \\frac{65}{12}$ hours.\n\n5.  Thursday night ($i=5$): Bed at $23{:}55$, wake at $06{:}40$. The elapsed time is $6$ hours and $45$ minutes. The duration is $S_5 = 6 + \\frac{45}{60} = 6 + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{24+3}{4} = \\frac{27}{4}$ hours.\n\nNext, we calculate the nightly sleep debt for each night. The physiologic sleep need is given as $S_{n} = 9$ hours. The nightly sleep debt is defined as $d_i = \\max\\{0, S_{n} - S_{i}\\}$. Since all calculated $S_i$ values are less than $9$, the debt is simply $d_i = S_n - S_i$.\n\n1.  Debt for night $1$: $d_1 = 9 - S_1 = 9 - \\frac{91}{12} = \\frac{108 - 91}{12} = \\frac{17}{12}$ hours.\n2.  Debt for night $2$: $d_2 = 9 - S_2 = 9 - \\frac{35}{6} = \\frac{54 - 35}{6} = \\frac{19}{6} = \\frac{38}{12}$ hours.\n3.  Debt for night $3$: $d_3 = 9 - S_3 = 9 - 7 = 2 = \\frac{24}{12}$ hours.\n4.  Debt for night $4$: $d_4 = 9 - S_4 = 9 - \\frac{65}{12} = \\frac{108 - 65}{12} = \\frac{43}{12}$ hours.\n5.  Debt for night $5$: $d_5 = 9 - S_5 = 9 - \\frac{27}{4} = \\frac{36 - 27}{4} = \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{27}{12}$ hours.\n\nThe weekly cumulative school-night sleep debt, $D$, is the sum of these nightly debts:\n$$D = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} d_i = \\frac{17}{12} + \\frac{38}{12} + \\frac{24}{12} + \\frac{43}{12} + \\frac{27}{12}$$\n$$D = \\frac{17 + 38 + 24 + 43 + 27}{12} = \\frac{149}{12} \\text{ hours}$$\n\nNow we use the provided odds-based model. The relationship between probability $p$ and odds $O$ is given by $O = \\frac{p}{1-p}$. The baseline probability at zero debt is $p_0 = 0.10$. The corresponding baseline odds, $O_0$, are:\n$$O_0 = \\frac{p_0}{1 - p_0} = \\frac{0.10}{1 - 0.10} = \\frac{0.1}{0.9} = \\frac{1}{9}$$\nThe model states that for each $1$-hour increase in cumulative debt $D$, the odds are multiplied by a factor of $r = 1.25$. Therefore, the odds at a debt level of $D$ are given by the formula $O(D) = O_0 \\cdot r^D$.\nSubstituting the values for $O_0$, $r$, and $D$:\n$$O(D) = \\frac{1}{9} \\left(1.25\\right)^{\\frac{149}{12}}$$\nTo find the probability $p(D)$, we convert the odds $O(D)$ back using the formula $p = \\frac{O}{1+O}$:\n$$p(D) = \\frac{O(D)}{1 + O(D)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{9} \\left(1.25\\right)^{\\frac{149}{12}}}{1 + \\frac{1}{9} \\left(1.25\\right)^{\\frac{149}{12}}}$$\nWe now compute the numerical value.

Let $T^+$ denote a positive test result and $T^-$ a negative test result. The observed evidence, $E$, is a positive first test followed by a negative second test, which we denote as the sequence $(T_1^+, T_2^-)$. We are asked to find the post-test probability $P(D|E) = P(D|T_1^+, T_2^-)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of the disorder given the evidence is:\n$$ P(D|E) = \\frac{P(E|D)P(D)}{P(E)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(E)$, is the total probability of observing the evidence, which can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(E) = P(E|D)P(D) + P(E|D^c)P(D^c) $$\nSubstituting this into Bayes' theorem gives its full form for this problem:\n$$ P(D|E) = \\frac{P(E|D)P(D)}{P(E|D)P(D) + P(E|D^c)P(D^c)} $$\n\nFirst, we identify the probabilities provided or directly derivable from the problem statement:\n- The pretest probability (prevalence) is $P(D) = 0.20$.\n- The probability of not having the disorder is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n- The sensitivity is the probability of a positive test given the disorder: $P(T^+|D) = 0.90$.\n- The specificity is the probability of a negative test given no disorder: $P(T^-|D^c) = 0.80$.\n\nFrom these, we can derive the complementary probabilities:\n- The false negative rate, the probability of a negative test given the disorder: $P(T^-|D) = 1 - P(T^+|D) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n- The false positive rate, the probability of a positive test given no disorder: $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$.\n\nNext, we calculate the conditional probability of the evidence $E = (T_1^+, T_2^-)$ given the disorder status ($D$ or $D^c$). The problem states to assume conditional independence of the tests. This means the probability of a sequence of test results, given the true disease state, is the product of the individual test probabilities given that state.\n\nThe probability of the evidence given the patient has the disorder is:\n$$ P(E|D) = P(T_1^+, T_2^-|D) = P(T_1^+|D) P(T_2^-|D) $$\nSubstituting the values for sensitivity and the false negative rate:\n$$ P(E|D) = (0.90) \\times (0.10) = 0.09 $$\n\nThe probability of the evidence given the patient does not have the disorder is:\n$$ P(E|D^c) = P(T_1^+, T_2^-|D^c) = P(T_1^+|D^c) P(T_2^-|D^c) $$\nSubstituting the values for the false positive rate and specificity:\n$$ P(E|D^c) = (0.20) \\times (0.80) = 0.16 $$\n\nNow we can calculate the two terms in the denominator of Bayes' theorem:\n- The numerator, which is also the first term of the denominator:\n$$ P(E|D)P(D) = (0.09) \\times (0.20) = 0.018 $$\n- The second term of the denominator:\n$$ P(E|D^c)P(D^c) = (0.16) \\times (0.80) = 0.128 $$\n\nThe total probability of the evidence, $P(E)$, is the sum of these two terms:\n$$ P(E) = 0.018 + 0.128 = 0.146 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the post-test probability $P(D|E)$:\n$$ P(D|E) = \\frac{P(E|D)P(D)}{P(E)} = \\frac{0.018}{0.146} $$\n$$ P(D|E) = \\frac{18}{146} = \\frac{9}{73} \\approx 0.12328767... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

The goal is to construct a stratified suicide risk assessment that explicitly integrates the following components as defined in standard clinical practice: suicidal ideation (thoughts of killing oneself), suicidal intent (subjective desire to act on suicidal thoughts), suicidal plan (specific method, time, and preparation), access to means (availability of the method), and history of past suicide attempts (self-injurious behavior with at least some intent to die). Two fundamental, well-tested facts provide the starting point for derivation: prior suicide attempt is among the strongest predictors of future attempt; access to lethal means and a specific plan with current intent indicate imminent risk requiring immediate safety interventions. Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) is defined as self-injury without intent to die and is a risk marker but not itself a suicide attempt. Protective factors (for example, engaged caregivers, reasons for living, and willingness to collaborate on a safety plan) can reduce but do not eliminate acute risk if current intent, plan, and means are present.\n\nCase, time point $1$ (T$1$): A $16$-year-old reports during the HEADDSS interview depressed mood for $3$ months, sleep disturbance, and passive suicidal ideation on most days (for example, “it would be easier if I did not wake up”). They deny current suicidal intent, deny any specific plan, and deny any prior suicide attempt. They describe NSSI by superficial cutting of the forearm last week without intent to die. They deny access to firearms. The caregiver stores prescription medications in an unlocked cabinet but agrees to immediately lock and control access to all medications and sharp objects. The adolescent identifies reasons for living (attachment to a younger sibling and a sports team), agrees to a collaborative written safety plan, and agrees to tell a trusted adult or call an emergency number if suicidal thoughts escalate. The caregiver is available to provide continuous supervision for the next several days.\n\nCase, time point $2$ (T$2$): Later the same day, on private re-interview, the adolescent discloses that two nights ago they ingested “a handful” of over-the-counter pain pills in an attempt to die but stopped after texting a friend; they did not seek medical care. They now report a specific plan to take approximately $30$ fluoxetine tablets at $23{:}00$ tonight, know exactly where the medication is stored (still unlocked), have written a note, and state “I do not want to be stopped.” The caregiver is currently at work and will not return until $22{:}30$. No firearms are in the home.\n\nUsing the defined components (ideation, intent, plan, means, and past attempts) and the above foundational facts, select the option that best constructs a stratified suicide risk assessment across T$1$ and T$2$ and specifies appropriate decision thresholds for disposition that are consistent with evidence-based adolescent practice in HEADDSS-guided care.\n\nA.

Prior suicide attempt is among the strongest predictors of a future attempt.\n2.  Access to lethal means and a specific plan with current intent indicate imminent risk requiring immediate safety interventions.\n3.

The principles of scientific validation apply as follows:\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in the evidence-based medical practice of adolescent mental health. The HEADDSS framework is a standard tool. The definitions of suicidal ideation, intent, plan, means, history, and NSSI are consistent with clinical and research standards (e.g., DSM-$5$, Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale). The two \"fundamental facts\" provided are core tenets of modern suicidology and risk assessment. The case vignettes are clinically realistic.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides two distinct, detailed clinical scenarios (T$1$ and T$2$) and a clear set of principles to apply. The question asks for a risk stratification and corresponding disposition, which can be logically derived from the provided information.\n*   **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, clinical language. It describes behaviors, statements, and conditions without subjective bias. The task is to apply the given principles to the given facts, a purely logical exercise.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a formalizable problem within the science of evidence-based medicine.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived by applying the given principles to the case data.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Risk Assessment and Disposition\n\n**Analysis of Time Point $1$ (T$1$):**\n*   **Ideation**: Passive ideation is present.\n*   **Intent**: Explicitly denied.\n*   **Plan**: Explicitly denied.\n*   **History**: History of suicide attempt is denied. The NSSI event is noted but, by definition, is not a suicide attempt. It serves as a significant risk factor for future suicidality and warrants intervention, but does not equate to acute risk in itself.\n*   **Means**: Access to medications and sharps is present but is being actively mitigated through an agreement with an engaged caregiver for immediate means restriction.\n*   **Protective Factors**: Strong protective factors are present: reasons for living, collaboration on a safety plan, and an available, engaged caregiver providing supervision.\n*   **Risk Stratification**: The constellation of passive ideation without intent or plan, no history of attempts, and the presence of strong protective factors with active safety planning (including means restriction) points to **low acute risk**.\n*   **Disposition**: For low acute risk, the standard of care is outpatient management. This must include: a formal safety plan, documented means restriction, ensuring caregiver supervision, and scheduling prompt follow-up (typically within $1$ to $7$ days) to monitor the situation.\n\n**Analysis of Time Point $2$ (T$2$):**\n*   **History**: A recent suicide attempt ($2$ nights prior) is now disclosed. Per Principle $1$, this is a very strong predictor of a future attempt.\n*   **Ideation, Intent, and Plan**: All are present, severe, and specific. There is active ideation, high intent (\"I do not want to be stopped\"), a specific plan (method: $30$ fluoxetine tablets, time: $23{:}00$ tonight), and preparatory action (written a note).\n*   **Means**: Access to the chosen lethal means is currently unrestricted, and the patient knows exactly how to access it.\n*   **Protective Factors**: The protective factors identified at T$1$ are now insufficient. Per Principle $3$, protective factors \"do not eliminate acute risk if current intent, plan, and means are present.\" All three of these conditions are met at T$2$.\n*   **Risk Stratification**: The combination of a recent attempt, current intent, a specific plan, and access to means constitutes **high/imminent risk**. This aligns perfectly with Principle $2$. The time frame is a matter of hours.\n*   **Disposition**: For high/imminent risk, Principle $2$ mandates \"immediate safety interventions.\" This requires removing the patient from the dangerous environment and ensuring they cannot act on their plan. The only appropriate disposition is an immediate transfer to an emergency department for medical and psychiatric evaluation, with continuous one-to-one observation to ensure safety, followed by likely inpatient psychiatric hospitalization.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. T$1$: Low risk (passive ideation only, no intent/plan/means, no past attempts); disposition: outpatient management with a written safety plan, caregiver means restriction, and follow-up within $7$ days. T$2$: Moderate risk (specific plan but protective factors present); disposition: urgent outpatient/partial program within $24$–$72$ hours; no immediate emergency department evaluation or hospitalization needed.**\n*   The T$1$ assessment and disposition are largely correct.\n*   The T$2$ assessment of \"Moderate risk\" is a severe underestimation. The statement that protective factors mitigate this level of risk violates Principle $3$.\n*   The T$2$ disposition is dangerously inadequate and contradicts the requirement for \"immediate safety interventions\" for imminent risk.\n*   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. T$1$: Moderate risk (passive ideation plus recent NSSI); disposition: same-day emergency evaluation is required; remove means and consider hospitalization. T$2$: High/imminent risk (recent suicide attempt, current intent, specific plan, access to means, time set); disposition: immediate emergency department evaluation with continuous observation and likely hospitalization.**\n*   The T$1$ assessment of \"Moderate risk\" is a possible but likely over-estimation given the strong protective factors and lack of intent/plan. The disposition, \"same-day emergency evaluation,\" is an over-reaction and not indicated for the T$1$ presentation.\n*   The T$2$ assessment and disposition are correct.\n*   Since the T$1$ analysis is flawed, the entire option is incorrect.\n*   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. T$1$: Low risk (passive ideation without intent, plan, or access, no past attempts, reliable caregiver able to restrict means, collaborative safety plan); disposition: outpatient management with documented safety plan, immediate means restriction, caregiver supervision, and follow-up within $1$–$7$ days. T$2$: High/imminent risk (recent attempt, current intent, specific plan, access to means, imminent time frame); disposition: immediate emergency department evaluation, continuous observation, rapid means removal, and probable inpatient admission.**\n*   The T$1$ assessment of \"Low risk\" is accurate and well-justified by summarizing the key factors. The specification \"without... access\" is justified by the immediate agreement to restrict means. The disposition is comprehensive and perfectly matches the standard of care for low risk.\n*   The T$2$ assessment of \"High/imminent risk\" is accurate and correctly identifies all the critical components that define this risk level.\n*   The T$2$ disposition is the only safe and clinically appropriate course of action, consistent with the foundational principles provided.\n*   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. T$1$: Low risk; disposition: routine discharge without a safety plan because protective factors are present. T$2$: High risk; disposition: intensive outpatient program with daily check-ins because caregiver can lock up medications later tonight; hospitalization is not indicated.**\n*   The T$1$ disposition is clinically negligent. Any level of suicidal ideation, especially with a risk factor like NSSI, requires a safety plan and follow-up.\n*   The T$2$ disposition is grossly inadequate and dangerous. It ignores the imminence of the risk and the patient's stated intent to not be stopped, effectively leaving the patient in a dangerous situation for several hours.\n*   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. T$1$: High risk due to NSSI and passive ideation; disposition: immediate hospitalization. T$2$: Moderate risk because there are no firearms; disposition: schedule outpatient follow-up next week and advise to avoid being alone tonight.**\n*   The T$1$ assessment of \"High risk\" is an incorrect over-estimation. The disposition for immediate hospitalization is not warranted.\n*   The T$2$ assessment of \"Moderate risk\" is a severe underestimation.
