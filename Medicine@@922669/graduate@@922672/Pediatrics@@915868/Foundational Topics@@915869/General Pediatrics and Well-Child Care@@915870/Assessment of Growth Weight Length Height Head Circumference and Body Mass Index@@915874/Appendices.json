Pediatric growth features are expressed as Standard Deviation Scores (SDS), which are dimensionless quantities defined as $z = \\frac{\\text{observed} - \\text{age-sex expected mean}}{\\text{age-sex expected standard deviation}}$. Use four features: height SDS ($z_H$), annualized height velocity SDS ($z_{HV}$), body mass index SDS ($z_{BMI}$), and head circumference SDS ($z_{HC}$).

For a given diagnosis $D$ from the set $\\{\\mathrm{GHD}, \\mathrm{CDGP}\\}$ and an observation vector $x$, Bayes' theorem states:\n$$\nP(D \\mid x) = \\frac{P(x \\mid D) P(D)}{P(x)}\n$$\nwhere:\n- $P(D \\mid x)$ is the posterior probability of the diagnosis given the data.\n- $P(x \\mid D)$ is the likelihood of observing the data given the diagnosis.\n- $P(D)$ is the prior probability of the diagnosis.\n- $P(x)$ is the marginal likelihood of the data, often called the evidence.\n\nThe problem asks for $P(D=\\mathrm{GHD} \\mid x)$.

The problem states that the four features in the vector $x=(z_H, z_{HV}, z_{BMI}, z_{HC})$ are conditionally independent given the diagnosis $D$. This is a key assumption of the Naive Bayes model. This independence allows us to express the joint likelihood as the product of the individual likelihoods for each feature:\n$$\nP(x \\mid D) = P(z_H \\mid D) \\cdot P(z_{HV} \\mid D) \\cdot P(z_{BMI} \\mid D) \\cdot P(z_{HC} \\mid D)\n$$\nEach individual likelihood, $P(z_i \\mid D)$, is given by the probability density function (PDF) of a Gaussian (normal) distribution, $\\mathcal{N}(z_i; \\mu_{i|D}, \\sigma_{i|D})$, where $\\mu_{i|D}$ and $\\sigma_{i|D}$ are the mean and standard deviation for feature $i$ under diagnosis $D$:\n$$\nP(z_i \\mid D) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{i|D} \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{z_i - \\mu_{i|D}}{\\sigma_{i|D}}\\right)^2\\right)\n$$\nThe specific parameters ($\\mu$ and $\\sigma$) for each feature and diagnosis are provided in the problem statement.\n\nMultiplying several small probabilities (the likelihood densities) can lead to numerical underflow. A more robust computational strategy is to work with logarithms. The log-likelihood is the sum of the individual log-likelihoods:\n$$\n\\log P(x \\mid D) = \\sum_{i \\in \\{H, HV, BMI, HC\\}} \\log P(z_i \\mid D)\n$$\nwhere the log-PDF of the Gaussian distribution is:\n$$\n\\log P(z_i \\mid D) = -\\log(\\sigma_{i|D}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\log(2\\pi) - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{z_i - \\mu_{i|D}}{\\sigma_{i|D}}\\right)^2\n$$\nWe can then compute quantities proportional to the posterior probabilities, which we will call scores, in the log domain:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{GHD}} = \\log P(\\mathrm{GHD}) + \\log P(x \\mid \\mathrm{GHD}) = \\log(0.2) + \\sum_{i} \\log P(z_i \\mid \\mathrm{GHD})\n$$\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{CDGP}} = \\log P(\\mathrm{CDGP}) + \\log P(x \\mid \\mathrm{CDGP}) = \\log(0.8) + \\sum_{i} \\log P(z_i \\mid \\mathrm{CDGP})\n$$\nTo obtain the final posterior probability $P(\\mathrm{GHD} \\mid x)$, we must normalize these scores by converting them back from the log domain and dividing by their sum. A numerically stable way to do this is using the log-sum-exp trick. The posterior probability is given by:\n$$\nP(\\mathrm{GHD} \\mid x) = \\frac{\\exp(S_{\\mathrm{GHD}})}{\\exp(S_{\\mathrm{GHD}}) + \\exp(S_{\\mathrm{CDGP}})}\n$$\nAn equivalent and simpler form, particularly for binary classification, is:\n$$\nP(\\mathrm{GHD} \\mid x) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(S_{\\mathrm{CDGP}} - S_{\\mathrm{GHD}})}\n$$\nThis is the logistic sigmoid function applied to the difference of the log-scores, which is robust against both underflow and overflow.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure for each test case $x$ is as follows:\n1.
