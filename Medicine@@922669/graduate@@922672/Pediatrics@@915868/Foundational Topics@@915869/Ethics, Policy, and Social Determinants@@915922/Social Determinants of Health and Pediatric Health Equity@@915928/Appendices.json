The scenario—evaluating health equity in pediatric preventive care based on social determinants of health (neighborhood resource level)—is a realistic and critical topic in pediatrics. The given completion rates are proportions between $0$ and $1$, which is factually appropriate. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data to calculate the requested metrics. The term \"standard epidemiologic definitions\" for absolute and relative inequality is sufficiently precise in this context. Absolute inequality is universally taken as the difference in rates (Rate Difference), and relative inequality is most commonly measured by the ratio of rates (Rate Ratio). As will be shown, the final answer is robust to the specific choice among common relative inequality metrics. The goal is clearly stated and a unique solution exists.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in quantitative, objective terms. It is free from subjective claims or bias.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet us denote the completion rate in a given region ($R \\in \\{X, Y\\}$) and neighborhood type ($N \\in \\{U, H\\}$ for Under-resourced and Higher-resourced, respectively) as $p_{R,N}$.\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n-   $p_{X,U} = 0.50$\n-   $p_{X,H} = 0.60$\n-   $p_{Y,U} = 0.70$\n-   $p_{Y,H} = 0.84$\n\nThe problem requires the use of standard epidemiologic definitions for inequality. The comparison is specified as \"under-resourced to higher-resourced,\" which establishes the higher-resourced neighborhoods as the reference group.\n\n**1. Absolute Inequality**\nAbsolute inequality is measured by the absolute difference in rates, commonly known as the Rate Difference ($RD$) or Absolute Risk Reduction. It is calculated as the difference between the rates of the two groups.\n$$ AI = |p_U - p_H| $$\nOr, to show the deficit, it can be expressed as $p_H - p_U$. Let us use this directional form.\n\nFor Region X:\n$$ AI_X = p_{X,H} - p_{X,U} = 0.60 - 0.50 = 0.10 $$\n\nFor Region Y:\n$$ AI_Y = p_{Y,H} - p_{Y,U} = 0.84 - 0.70 = 0.14 $$\nThe absolute inequality is greater in Region Y ($0.14$) than in Region X ($0.10$).\n\n**2. Relative Inequality**\nRelative inequality is most commonly measured by the Rate Ratio ($RR$), which is the ratio of the rate in the comparison group (under-resourced) to the rate in the reference group (higher-resourced).\n$$ RI = \\frac{p_U}{p_H} $$\nA value of $RI$ further from $1$ indicates greater relative inequality.\n\nFor Region X:\n$$ RI_X = \\frac{p_{X,U}}{p_{X,H}} = \\frac{0.50}{0.60} = \\frac{5}{6} $$\n\nFor Region Y:\n$$ RI_Y = \\frac{p_{Y,U}}{p_{Y,H}} = \\frac{0.70}{0.84} = \\frac{70}{84} $$\nTo simplify the fraction for $RI_Y$:\n$$ \\frac{70}{84} = \\frac{14 \\times 5}{14 \\times 6} = \\frac{5}{6} $$\nSo, $RI_Y = \\frac{5}{6}$.\n\n**3. Comparison of Relative Inequality**\nWe find that $RI_X = \\frac{5}{6}$ and $RI_Y = \\frac{5}{6}$. The relative inequalities in the two regions are identical. Therefore, neither region exhibits greater relative inequality. This highlights the important distinction between absolute and relative measures of inequality: Region Y has a larger absolute gap in completion rates, but the relative disparity between the two neighborhood types is the same in both regions.\n\nThis result occurs because the rates in Region Y are a constant multiple of the rates in Region X.\n$$ p_{Y,U} = 0.70 = 1.4 \\times 0.50 = 1.4 \\times p_{X,U} $$\n$$ p_{Y,H} = 0.84 = 1.4 \\times 0.60 = 1.4 \\times p_{X,H} $$\nThe rate ratio is a scale-invariant measure, meaning $RI(k \\cdot p_1, k \\cdot p_2) = \\frac{k \\cdot p_1}{k \\cdot p_2} = \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = RI(p_1, p_2)$. Thus, it was guaranteed that $RI_X = RI_Y$.\n\n**4. Ratio of Relative Inequalities**\nThe final step is to compute the ratio of the relative inequality in region X to that in region Y. Let's call this ratio $R$.\n$$ R = \\frac{RI_X}{RI_Y} $$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$ R = \\frac{5/6}{5/6} = 1 $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the result to four significant figures. The exact value is $1$. Expressed with four significant figures, this is $1.000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.000}$$", "id": "5206090"}, {"introduction": "Once a health disparity is identified, a critical next step is to evaluate interventions designed to reduce it.

The solution will be derived within the potential outcomes framework, as specified.\n\nFirst, let us define the necessary notation. Let $Y_{G,t}$ represent the observed outcome (proportion of well-child visit completion) for a group $G$ at a time period $t$.\nThe groups are the treatment group (LEP families), denoted by $T$, and the comparison group (non-LEP families), denoted by $C$.\nThe time periods are the pre-expansion period, $t=0$, and the post-expansion period, $t=1$.\n\nThe data provided in the problem statement can be summarized as follows:\n-   Outcome for the treatment group (LEP) in the pre-expansion period: $Y_{T,0} = 0.62$\n-   Outcome for the comparison group (non-LEP) in the pre-expansion period: $Y_{C,0} = 0.80$\n-   Outcome for the treatment group (LEP) in the post-expansion period: $Y_{T,1} = 0.74$\n-   Outcome for the comparison group (non-LEP) in the post-expansion period: $Y_{C,1} = 0.82$\n\nThe problem requires us to compute the average causal effect for the treated group (the LEP families), which is often referred to as the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT). Within the potential outcomes framework, the ATT is defined as the difference between the realized outcome under treatment and the counterfactual outcome that would have been observed for the same group in the absence of treatment.\n\nLet $Y_{T,1}^{(1)}$ be the potential outcome for the treatment group at time $t=1$ with the treatment (interpreter service expansion). This is the observed outcome, so $Y_{T,1}^{(1)} = Y_{T,1} = 0.74$.\nLet $Y_{T,1}^{(0)}$ be the potential outcome for the treatment group at time $t=1$ *without* the treatment. This is the counterfactual outcome that we cannot observe directly and must estimate.\n\nThe ATT is then defined as:\n$$\n\\text{ATT} = E[Y^{(1)} - Y^{(0)} | G=T, t=1] = Y_{T,1}^{(1)} - Y_{T,1}^{(0)}\n$$\nTo estimate the counterfactual $Y_{T,1}^{(0)}$, we rely on the crucial \"parallel trends\" assumption. This assumption posits that, in the absence of the treatment, the change in the outcome for the treatment group would have been the same as the change observed in the comparison group. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nY_{T,1}^{(0)} - Y_{T,0} = Y_{C,1} - Y_{C,0}\n$$\nThe right-hand side of this equation represents the secular trend in the outcome observed in the untreated comparison group. We can rearrange this equation to solve for the counterfactual outcome for the treatment group:\n$$\nY_{T,1}^{(0)} = Y_{T,0} + (Y_{C,1} - Y_{C,0})\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given values to compute the estimated counterfactual:\n$$\nY_{T,1}^{(0)} = 0.62 + (0.82 - 0.80)\n$$\n$$\nY_{T,1}^{(0)} = 0.62 + 0.02 = 0.64\n$$\nThis result, $Y_{T,1}^{(0)} = 0.64$, is our estimate for what the well-child visit completion proportion for LEP families would have been at time $t=1$ if the interpreter services had not been expanded.\n\nWith the estimated counterfactual in hand, we can now compute the ATT by taking the difference between the observed outcome for the treated group and this counterfactual outcome:\n$$\n\\text{ATT} = Y_{T,1}^{(1)} - Y_{T,1}^{(0)} = Y_{T,1} - Y_{T,1}^{(0)}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{ATT} = 0.74 - 0.64 = 0.10\n$$\nThis result is the difference-in-differences estimate of the causal effect.\n\nFor verification, we can use the standard formulation of the DiD estimator, which calculates the difference in the change over time between the two groups:\n$$\n\\text{DiD} = (Y_{T,1} - Y_{T,0}) - (Y_{C,1} - Y_{C,0})\n$$\nSubstituting the given values into this formula:\n-   The change in the outcome for the treatment group (LEP): $Y_{T,1} - Y_{T,0} = 0.74 - 0.62 = 0.12$\n-   The change in the outcome for the comparison group (non-LEP): $Y_{C,1} - Y_{C,0} = 0.82 - 0.80 = 0.02$\n\nThe DiD estimate is the difference between these two changes:\n$$\n\\text{DiD} = 0.12 - 0.02 = 0.10\n$$\nThis confirms the result obtained from the potential outcomes derivation. The estimated causal effect of the interpreter service expansion is an increase of $0.10$ in the proportion of well-child visit completion for LEP families.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal proportion rounded to four significant figures.
