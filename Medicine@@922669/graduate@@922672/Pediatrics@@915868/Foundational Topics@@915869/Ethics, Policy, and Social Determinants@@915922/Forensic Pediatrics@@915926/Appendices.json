Impact Speed and Kinetic Energy**\n\nWe model the fall as a conversion of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy. Let the initial state be at the beginning of the fall (height $h$) and the final state be at the instant of impact (height $0$). We assume the initial velocity is zero.\n\nThe gravitational potential energy at height $h$ is $PE = mgh$.\nThe kinetic energy at impact, with velocity $v$, is $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$.\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, assuming negligible air resistance:\n$$mgh = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$\nWe can solve for the impact speed $v$:\n$$v^2 = 2gh$$\n$$v = \\sqrt{2gh}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$v = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot (9.81 \\text{ m} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}) \\cdot (0.9 \\text{ m})} = \\sqrt{17.658 \\text{ m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}} \\approx 4.2021 \\text{ m} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$$\n\nThe kinetic energy $K$ at the moment of impact is equal to the initial potential energy:\n$$K = mgh$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$K = (12 \\text{ kg}) \\cdot (9.81 \\text{ m} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}) \\cdot (0.9 \\text{ m}) = 105.948 \\text{ J}$$\nSo, the peak impact speed is $v \\approx 4.2021$ $\\text{m} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$ and the total kinetic energy at impact is $K = 105.948$ $\\text{J}$.\n\n**2. Peak Linear Head Acceleration**\n\nDuring the impact, the head decelerates from speed $v$ to zero over a stopping distance $d$. The problem specifies a model of uniform (constant) deceleration, which we denote as $a_{\\text{peak}}$. We use the time-independent kinematic equation:\n$$v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a_{\\text{peak}}d$$\nHere, the initial velocity is the impact velocity, $v_i = v = \\sqrt{2gh}$, and the final velocity is $v_f = 0$.\n$$0^2 = (\\sqrt{2gh})^2 + 2a_{\\text{peak}}d$$\n$$0 = 2gh + 2a_{\\text{peak}}d$$\nSolving for the acceleration $a_{\\text{peak}}$:\n$$a_{\\text{peak}} = -\\frac{2gh}{2d} = -\\frac{gh}{d}$$\nThe negative sign indicates deceleration. The magnitude of this peak acceleration is:\n$$|a_{\\text{peak}}| = \\frac{gh}{d}$$\nWe are asked to express this acceleration in multiples of standard gravity, $g$. Let this dimensionless quantity be $A_{\\text{peak},g}$.\n$$A_{\\text{peak},g} = \\frac{|a_{\\text{peak}}|}{g} = \\frac{gh/d}{g} = \\frac{h}{d}$$\nThis result shows that, under this model, the peak acceleration in g-multiples depends only on the ratio of the fall height to the stopping distance.\n\nSubstituting the given values for $h$ and $d$:\n$$A_{\\text{peak},g} = \\frac{0.9 \\text{ m}}{0.006 \\text{ m}} = 150$$\nThus, the peak linear head acceleration is $150$ times the acceleration of gravity, or $150g$. The absolute peak acceleration is $|a_{\\text{peak}}| = 150 \\cdot (9.81 \\text{ m} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}) = 1471.5$ $\\text{m} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}$.\n\n**3. Exceedance Factor**\n\nThe exceedance factor $\\mathcal{R}$ is defined as the ratio of the calculated peak acceleration $A_{\\text{peak},g}$ to the assumed injury threshold, which is given as $80$ $g$.\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{A_{\\text{peak},g}}{80}$$\nSubstituting the value of $A_{\\text{peak},g}$ we calculated:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{150}{80} = \\frac{15}{8} = 1.875$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The value $1.875$ is exact and already has four significant figures when written as $1.875$.\n\nTherefore, the exceedance factor is $1.875$. Since $\\mathcal{R} > 1$, the calculated peak linear acceleration for this fall scenario exceeds the given representative threshold for skull fracture risk.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.875}$$", "id": "5145270"}, {"introduction": "Beyond biomechanics, a critical skill is formally weighing clinical evidence. This practice introduces Bayesian reasoning, a powerful framework for updating one's diagnostic suspicion in light of new findings. You will learn to use the Likelihood Ratio ($LR$), a measure of an evidence's diagnostic power, to transform a pre-test (prior) probability into a more informed post-test (posterior) probability of abuse [@problem_id:5145267].", "problem": "In a forensic pediatrics evaluation of suspected inflicted trauma, a clinician integrates epidemiologic context and clinical features to form a pre-examination probability of abuse of $0.2$. A subsequently identified constellation of findings (for example, patterned bruising with location and age incongruent with the reported mechanism) has been previously validated in case-control diagnostic accuracy studies to have a positive Likelihood Ratio (LR) of $15$ for abuse versus non-abuse when the constellation is present. Using only first principles—core definitions of probability, odds, sensitivity, specificity, Bayes’ theorem, and the definition of the Likelihood Ratio—derive the expression for the posterior probability of abuse given the presence of this finding constellation and compute its value for the given parameters. Express the final posterior probability as a decimal and round your answer to four significant figures. Then, interpret the meaning of your numeric result in the forensic pediatrics context, carefully distinguishing probabilities from Likelihood Ratios and emphasizing what is (and is not) implied by the calculation.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in Bayesian probability theory as applied to medical diagnostics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that abuse has occurred, and let $F$ be the event that the specific constellation of clinical findings is present. The complement of $A$, denoted $A^c$, is the event that abuse has not occurred (i.e., the \"non-abuse\" state).\n\nFirst, we extract the given information from the problem statement:\n1.  The pre-examination (prior) probability of abuse: $P(A) = 0.2$.\n2.  The positive Likelihood Ratio for the presence of the finding constellation: $LR(+) = 15$.\n\nOur goal is to derive and compute the posterior probability of abuse given the presence of the findings, denoted $P(A|F)$.\n\nThe derivation will proceed from first principles as requested.\n\nThe definition of the positive Likelihood Ratio ($LR(+)$) is the ratio of the probability of the finding being present given the condition is present, to the probability of the finding being present given the condition is absent. In our notation:\n$$LR(+) = \\frac{P(F|A)}{P(F|A^c)}$$\nwhere $P(F|A)$ is the sensitivity of the finding, and $P(F|A^c)$ is the false positive rate (1 - specificity).\n\nBayes' theorem states the relationship between a conditional probability and its inverse:\n$$P(A|F) = \\frac{P(F|A) P(A)}{P(F)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(F)$, can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$P(F) = P(F|A)P(A) + P(F|A^c)P(A^c)$$\n\nSubstituting this into Bayes' theorem gives:\n$$P(A|F) = \\frac{P(F|A) P(A)}{P(F|A)P(A) + P(F|A^c)P(A^c)}$$\n\nTo incorporate the Likelihood Ratio, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by $P(F|A^c)$:\n$$P(A|F) = \\frac{\\frac{P(F|A)}{P(F|A^c)} P(A)}{\\frac{P(F|A)}{P(F|A^c)} P(A) + \\frac{P(F|A^c)}{P(F|A^c)} P(A^c)}$$\n\nSubstituting the definition of $LR(+)$, we obtain the general expression for the posterior probability:\n$$P(A|F) = \\frac{LR(+) \\cdot P(A)}{LR(+) \\cdot P(A) + P(A^c)}$$\n\nSince $A^c$ is the complement of $A$, we have $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$. The expression becomes:\n$$P(A|F) = \\frac{LR(+) \\cdot P(A)}{LR(+) \\cdot P(A) + (1 - P(A))}$$\nThis formula allows the direct calculation of the posterior probability from the prior probability and the Likelihood Ratio.\n\nAn alternative and often more intuitive derivation uses the concept of odds. The odds of an event $E$ are defined as $O(E) = \\frac{P(E)}{1-P(E)}$.\n- The prior odds of abuse are: $\\text{Odds}(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{P(A^c)}$.\n- The posterior odds of abuse given the finding are: $\\text{Odds}(A|F) = \\frac{P(A|F)}{P(A^c|F)}$.\n\nUsing Bayes' theorem for both $P(A|F)$ and $P(A^c|F)$:\n$$\\text{Odds}(A|F) = \\frac{P(A|F)}{P(A^c|F)} = \\frac{P(F|A)P(A)/P(F)}{P(F|A^c)P(A^c)/P(F)} = \\frac{P(F|A)P(A)}{P(F|A^c)P(A^c)}$$\nRearranging terms, we find:\n$$\\text{Odds}(A|F) = \\left(\\frac{P(F|A)}{P(F|A^c)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{P(A)}{P(A^c)}\\right) = LR(+) \\cdot \\text{Odds}(A)$$\nThis shows that the posterior odds are simply the prior odds multiplied by the Likelihood Ratio.\n\nNow we can compute the value for the given parameters.\nFirst, calculate the prior odds of abuse:\nThe prior probability of abuse is $P(A)=0.2$, so the prior probability of non-abuse is $P(A^c)=1-0.2=0.8$.\n$$\\text{Odds}(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{P(A^c)} = \\frac{0.2}{0.8} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$$\n\nNext, calculate the posterior odds using the given $LR(+) = 15$:\n$$\\text{Odds}(A|F) = LR(+) \\cdot \\text{Odds}(A) = 15 \\times 0.25 = 3.75$$\n\nFinally, we convert the posterior odds back to a probability. If $\\text{Odds}(E) = O$, then $P(E) = \\frac{O}{1+O}$.\n$$P(A|F) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(A|F)}{1 + \\text{Odds}(A|F)} = \\frac{3.75}{1 + 3.75} = \\frac{3.75}{4.75}$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction:\n$$P(A|F) = \\frac{15/4}{19/4} = \\frac{15}{19}$$\n\nNow, we compute the decimal value and round to four significant figures:\n$$P(A|F) = \\frac{15}{19} \\approx 0.78947368...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.7895$.\n\n**Interpretation of the Result:**\n\nThe calculated posterior probability of abuse, $P(A|F)$, is approximately $0.7895$ or $78.95\\%$. This result must be interpreted with care in the forensic pediatrics context.\n\n1.  **Distinction between Probability and Likelihood Ratio**:\n    - The **posterior probability** of $0.7895$ is the clinician's revised, quantitative degree of belief that abuse is the cause of the child's condition, *after* accounting for the specific constellation of findings. It directly addresses the question: \"Given the clinical evidence I have now observed, how likely is it that this child was abused?\"\n    - The **Likelihood Ratio** of $15$ is a measure of the diagnostic power of the evidence itself, independent of any specific case's pre-test probability. It means that this particular constellation of findings is $15$ times more likely to be seen in a child who has been abused than in a child who has not. It does not, by itself, represent the probability of abuse. It is a statistical weight that quantifies how strongly a piece of evidence supports one hypothesis over another.\n\n2.  **What the Calculation Implies**: The calculation demonstrates a formal process of evidence-based reasoning. The clinician begins with a pre-examination suspicion (a prior probability of $20\\%$) based on the overall context. The identification of a specific, highly indicative set of findings acts as powerful evidence, allowing the clinician to use the Likelihood Ratio as a mathematical tool to update their initial belief. The probability of abuse is revised substantially upwards, from a $1$ in $5$ chance to nearly a $4$ in $5$ chance ($78.95\\%$). This quantifies the diagnostic shift prompted by the new evidence.\n\n3.  **What the Calculation Does Not Imply**:\n    - This result is **not proof** of abuse. A probability of $78.95\\%$ is high but not certain. It implies a $100\\% - 78.95\\% = 21.05\\%$ probability that abuse is *not* the cause, even in the presence of these highly suggestive findings. Other explanations (e.g., rare medical conditions, an atypical accidental injury) remain possible, albeit less probable.\n    - The final probability is critically dependent on both the Likelihood Ratio *and* the **prior probability**. If the clinician had started with a much lower pre-examination suspicion (e.g., a prior probability of $1\\%$), the same evidence ($LR(+)=15$) would yield a posterior probability of only $\\frac{15 \\times 0.01}{15 \\times 0.01 + (1-0.01)} \\approx 13.2\\%$. Thus, the posterior probability is not a characteristic of the finding alone but a synthesis of prior belief and new evidence.\n    - The validity of the $0.7895$ figure is contingent upon the accuracy of the inputs. The prior probability ($0.2$) is an estimate, and the Likelihood Ratio ($15$) is derived from population studies that may or may not perfectly apply to the specific patient.

The likelihood ratio is defined as the ratio of the probabilities of observing the evidence under each of the competing hypotheses.\n\nLet the joint evidence be denoted by $E = (T, L, N)$. The likelihood ratio, $LR(E)$, is given by the definition:\n$$ LR(T,L,N) = \\frac{P(T, L, N \\mid H_{A})}{P(T, L, N \\mid H_{X})} $$\n\nThe problem statement specifies that the features $T$, $L$, and $N$ are conditionally independent given either hypothesis $H_{A}$ or $H_{X}$. This is the central assumption of a Naive Bayes model. By the definition of conditional independence, the joint probability of the observations given a hypothesis is the product of the individual conditional probabilities.\n\nFor hypothesis $H_{A}$, the joint conditional probability is:\n$$ P(T, L, N \\mid H_{A}) = P(T \\mid H_{A}) \\cdot P(L \\mid H_{A}) \\cdot P(N \\mid H_{A}) $$\n\nFor hypothesis $H_{X}$, the joint conditional probability is:\n$$ P(T, L, N \\mid H_{X}) = P(T \\mid H_{X}) \\cdot P(L \\mid H_{X}) \\cdot P(N \\mid H_{X}) $$\n\nSubstituting these products into the expression for the likelihood ratio yields the derived expression for the combined $LR$:\n$$ LR(T,L,N) = \\frac{P(T \\mid H_{A}) \\cdot P(L \\mid H_{A}) \\cdot P(N \\mid H_{A})}{P(T \\mid H_{X}) \\cdot P(L \\mid H_{X}) \\cdot P(N \\mid H_{X})} $$\n\nThis expression can also be viewed as the product of the individual likelihood ratios for each feature:\n$$ LR(T,L,N) = \\left(\\frac{P(T \\mid H_{A})}{P(T \\mid H_{X})}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{P(L \\mid H_{A})}{P(L \\mid H_{X})}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{P(N \\mid H_{A})}{P(N \\mid H_{X})}\\right) $$\n\nNow, we will evaluate this expression numerically using the provided data.\nThe given conditional probabilities are:\n-   $P(T \\mid H_{A}) = 0.48$ and $P(T \\mid H_{X}) = 0.07$\n-   $P(L \\mid H_{A}) = 0.18$ and $P(L \\mid H_{X}) = 0.003$\n-   $P(N \\mid H_{A}) = 0.42$ and $P(N \\mid H_{X}) = 0.12$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator, which is the likelihood of the evidence under the abuse hypothesis, $P(T, L, N \\mid H_{A})$:\n$$ P(T, L, N \\mid H_{A}) = 0.48 \\times 0.18 \\times 0.42 = 0.036288 $$\n\nNext, calculate the denominator, which is the likelihood of the evidence under the accident hypothesis, $P(T, L, N \\mid H_{X})$:\n$$ P(T, L, N \\mid H_{X}) = 0.07 \\times 0.003 \\times 0.12 = 0.0000252 $$\n\nFinally, compute the ratio:\n$$ LR = \\frac{0.036288}{0.0000252} = 1440 $$\n\nThe result is exactly $1440$.
