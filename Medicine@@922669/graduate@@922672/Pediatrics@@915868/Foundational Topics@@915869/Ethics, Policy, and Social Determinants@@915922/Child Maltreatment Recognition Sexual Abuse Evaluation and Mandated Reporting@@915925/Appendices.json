It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary information and assumptions for a unique solution. The context provided is relevant to the field of pediatrics and represents a standard application of Bayesian inference in clinical decision-making. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is provided below.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the infant has abusive head trauma (AHT), and $D^c$ be the event that the infant does not have AHT.\nLet $M^+$ be the event of a positive Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) result.\nLet $O^+$ be the event of a positive ophthalmologic examination result.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are:\nThe pretest probability of AHT is $P(D) = 0.10$.\nThe pretest probability of not having AHT is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\nThe positive likelihood ratio for the MRI is $LR^{+}_{MRI} = 7$.\nThe positive likelihood ratio for the ophthalmologic exam is $LR^{+}_{Ophtho} = 5$.\nThe two tests are conditionally independent given the disease status.\n\nWe are tasked with finding the posterior probability of AHT given a positive result on both tests, which is denoted as $P(D|M^+ \\cap O^+)$. We must derive this from fundamental principles.\n\nFirst, we will establish the definition of the positive likelihood ratio ($LR^+$). For a given diagnostic test with a positive result $T^+$, the $LR^+$ is the ratio of the probability of a positive test result in a subject with the disease to the probability of a positive test result in a subject without the disease:\n$$\nLR^{+} = \\frac{P(T^+|D)}{P(T^+|D^c)}\n$$\nThis ratio quantifies the evidential strength of a positive test result.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the combined evidential impact of the two positive tests. Given the assumption of conditional independence, the likelihood ratio for the combined event of two positive tests ($M^+$ and $O^+$) is the product of their individual likelihood ratios. We shall derive this explicitly.\nThe combined likelihood ratio, $LR^{+}_{comb}$, is defined as:\n$$\nLR^{+}_{comb} = \\frac{P(M^+ \\cap O^+ | D)}{P(M^+ \\cap O^+ | D^c)}\n$$\nThe assumption of conditional independence states that $P(M^+ \\cap O^+ | D) = P(M^+|D)P(O^+|D)$ and $P(M^+ \\cap O^+ | D^c) = P(M^+|D^c)P(O^+|D^c)$. Substituting these into the expression for $LR^{+}_{comb}$:\n$$\nLR^{+}_{comb} = \\frac{P(M^+|D)P(O^+|D)}{P(M^+|D^c)P(O^+|D^c)} = \\left(\\frac{P(M^+|D)}{P(M^+|D^c)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{P(O^+|D)}{P(O^+|D^c)}\\right)\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the combined likelihood ratio is the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$\nLR^{+}_{comb} = LR^{+}_{MRI} \\times LR^{+}_{Ophtho}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nLR^{+}_{comb} = 7 \\times 5 = 35\n$$\nThis value, $35$, represents the combined evidential impact of the two positive tests. A positive result on both tests is $35$ times more likely to occur in an infant with AHT than in an infant without AHT.\n\nNext, we update the pretest probability to the posterior probability using Bayesian updating, starting from the fundamental definition of conditional probability (Bayes' theorem). Let $E$ represent the combined evidence, i.e., $E = M^+ \\cap O^+$. We seek to calculate $P(D|E)$.\nAccording to Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nP(D|E) = \\frac{P(E|D)P(D)}{P(E)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(E)$, is the total probability of observing the evidence. It can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(E) = P(E|D)P(D) + P(E|D^c)P(D^c)\n$$\nSubstituting this expansion into Bayes' theorem gives the full form:\n$$\nP(D|E) = \\frac{P(E|D)P(D)}{P(E|D)P(D) + P(E|D^c)P(D^c)}\n$$\nTo incorporate the likelihood ratio, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by $P(E|D^c)$:\n$$\nP(D|E) = \\frac{\\frac{P(E|D)}{P(E|D^c)} P(D)}{\\frac{P(E|D)}{P(E|D^c)} P(D) + \\frac{P(E|D^c)}{P(E|D^c)} P(D^c)}\n$$\nBy definition, $\\frac{P(E|D)}{P(E|D^c)} = LR^{+}_{comb}$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\nP(D|E) = \\frac{LR^{+}_{comb} \\cdot P(D)}{LR^{+}_{comb} \\cdot P(D) + P(D^c)}\n$$\nThis formula correctly updates the pretest probability $P(D)$ to the posterior probability $P(D|E)$ using the combined likelihood ratio, and has been derived from first principles as required.\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerical values into this derived expression:\n$P(D) = 0.10$\n$P(D^c) = 0.90$\n$LR^{+}_{comb} = 35$\n\n$$\nP(D|M^+ \\cap O^+) = \\frac{35 \\times 0.10}{35 \\times 0.10 + 0.90}\n$$\n$$\nP(D|M^+ \\cap O^+) = \\frac{3.5}{3.5 + 0.9} = \\frac{3.5}{4.4}\n$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $10$:\n$$\nP(D|M^+ \\cap O^+) = \\frac{35}{44}\n$$\nThe integers $35$ and $44$ have prime factorizations of $5 \\times 7$ and $2^2 \\times 11$, respectively.
