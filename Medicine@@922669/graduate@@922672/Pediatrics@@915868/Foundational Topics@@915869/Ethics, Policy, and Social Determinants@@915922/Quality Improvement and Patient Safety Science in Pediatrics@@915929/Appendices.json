This problem hones skills in constrained optimization, forcing an integration of pharmacology, logistical constraints, and human factors engineering to protect a patient. [@problem_id:5198093]", "problem": "A pediatric quality improvement team is redesigning an Electronic Health Record (EHR) order to reduce tenfold dosing errors for an analgesic administered to children. Consider a single patient, a child weighing $12~\\mathrm{kg}$, who requires parenteral morphine for acute pain.\n\nFundamental medication and system constraints:\n- Therapeutic intravenous (IV) morphine single-dose range for children: $0.05$ to $0.10~\\mathrm{mg/kg/dose}$, with a maximum single dose of $5~\\mathrm{mg}$.\n- Available stock vial concentration: $2~\\mathrm{mg/mL}$.\n- For peripheral intravenous (PIV) push, pharmacy policy requires dilution to a maximum concentration of $1~\\mathrm{mg/mL}$ before administration.\n- Syringe measurement capabilities: minimum accurate deliverable volume is $0.2~\\mathrm{mL}$, and volumes must be ordered in increments of $0.1~\\mathrm{mL}$.\n- Safety principles to prevent dose-expression errors: do not use trailing zeros, and always use a leading zero for doses less than $1~\\mathrm{mg}$.\n\nProposed EHR order sentence options and their error-risk characteristics (each option is mutually exclusive, and only one will be used):\n- Option A (free-text): decimal point use carries a per-order tenfold overdose probability of $p_{\\mathrm{dec,free}}=2.0\\times 10^{-3}$; if the dose is an integer in milligrams and a trailing zero is used (for example, “$1.0~\\mathrm{mg}$”), the per-order tenfold overdose probability is $p_{\\mathrm{trail}}=5.0\\times 10^{-4}$. Leading zeros are not enforced.\n- Option B (structured order set): leading zeros are enforced and trailing zeros are stripped. If the dose requires a decimal point (i.e., is non-integer in milligrams), the per-order tenfold overdose probability is $p_{\\mathrm{dec,str}}=5.0\\times 10^{-4}$. If the dose is an integer in milligrams, no decimal point is displayed and trailing zeros are not used; in that case, the per-order tenfold overdose probability is $0$.\n\nAssumptions for risk modeling:\n- For a given order, only one mechanism applies: if the numeric value is an integer in milligrams and the sentence format uses no decimal point, the decimal-point error mechanism does not apply. If a trailing zero is present (Option A when an integer is entered as “$x.0~\\mathrm{mg}$”), the trailing-zero mechanism applies. If the dose is non-integer in milligrams (requires a decimal point), the decimal-point mechanism applies according to the option in use.\n- Use only the provided probabilities and do not introduce additional sources of risk. Treat these per-order probabilities as the outcome of well-tested observational data on error mechanisms.\n\nTask:\nUsing only the foundational definition of weight-based dosing (dose equals weight times dose per kilogram) and the above constraints and risk properties, determine the single morphine dose in milligrams that minimizes the per-order tenfold overdose probability while:\n- remaining within the therapeutic range for this $12~\\mathrm{kg}$ child,\n- satisfying the PIV concentration constraint,\n- and complying with the syringe measurement constraints.\n\nIf multiple doses lead to the same minimal risk, choose the midpoint of the therapeutic range expressed in milligrams.

This is a constrained optimization problem.\n\nFirst, we must validate the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n- Patient weight: $W = 12~\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Therapeutic dose range: $0.05$ to $0.10~\\mathrm{mg/kg/dose}$\n- Maximum single dose: $D_{\\mathrm{max}} = 5~\\mathrm{mg}$\n- Stock vial concentration: $C_{\\mathrm{stock}} = 2~\\mathrm{mg/mL}$\n- Required dilution for administration: $C_{\\mathrm{admin}} \\leq 1~\\mathrm{mg/mL}$\n- Minimum accurate deliverable volume: $V_{\\mathrm{min}} = 0.2~\\mathrm{mL}$\n- Syringe volume increments: $\\Delta V = 0.1~\\mathrm{mL}$\n- Option A (free-text) risk probabilities: $p_{\\mathrm{dec,free}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ for decimal use, $p_{\\mathrm{trail}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ for trailing zero use on an integer dose.\n- Option B (structured) risk probabilities: $p_{\\mathrm{dec,str}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ for non-integer doses, $p_{\\mathrm{int}} = 0$ for integer doses.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in pharmacology and patient safety principles, is well-posed with a clear objective and constraints, and is expressed in objective, quantitative terms. There are no contradictions or missing pieces of critical information. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution process involves three main steps:\n1. Determine the set of all therapeutically acceptable doses for the patient.\n2. Analyze how systemic constraints (syringe, concentration) affect the choice of dose.\n3. Evaluate the overdose risk for the set of possible doses and identify the dose that minimizes this risk.\n\nStep 1: Determine the therapeutic dose range.\nThe patient weighs $W = 12~\\mathrm{kg}$. The therapeutic dose rate is between $0.05~\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ and $0.10~\\mathrm{mg/kg}$.\nThe minimum therapeutic dose is:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{ther,min}} = 12~\\mathrm{kg} \\times 0.05~\\mathrm{mg/kg} = 0.6~\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe maximum therapeutic dose is:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{ther,max}} = 12~\\mathrm{kg} \\times 0.10~\\mathrm{mg/kg} = 1.2~\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe overall maximum single dose is given as $5~\\mathrm{mg}$, which is greater than $D_{\\mathrm{ther,max}}$. Thus, the allowed therapeutic range for this patient is $D \\in [0.6, 1.2]~\\mathrm{mg}$.\n\nStep 2: Analyze systemic constraints.\nThe ordered dose $D$ in milligrams must be administrable. The pharmacy must prepare a volume $V$ from a concentration $C_{\\mathrm{admin}}$ such that $V = D / C_{\\mathrm{admin}}$. The constraints are $C_{\\mathrm{admin}} \\leq 1~\\mathrm{mg/mL}$, $V \\ge 0.2~\\mathrm{mL}$, and $V$ must be a multiple of $0.1~\\mathrm{mL}$.\nFor any dose $D$ in the therapeutic range $[0.6, 1.2]~\\mathrm{mg}$, it is possible for the pharmacy to choose a valid concentration $C_{\\mathrm{admin}}$ and volume $V$. For example, for a dose $D$, one could choose a volume $V'$ that is a multiple of $0.1~\\mathrm{mL}$ and satisfies $V' \\ge D$. This ensures that the required concentration $C_{\\mathrm{admin}} = D/V'$ will be less than or equal to $1~\\mathrm{mg/mL}$. Since all doses $D \\ge 0.6~\\mathrm{mg}$, the condition $V' \\ge D$ also ensures $V' \\ge 0.2~\\mathrm{mL}$.\nTherefore, the administration constraints do not further restrict the set of possible doses from the therapeutic range. The set of possible doses remains the continuous interval $D \\in [0.6, 1.2]~\\mathrm{mg}$.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate risk and find the optimal dose.\nThe objective is to minimize the per-order tenfold overdose probability, $P(\\text{error})$. The problem specifies that the risk depends on the EHR ordering option and whether the dose value in milligrams is an integer. For any given dose $D$, we can choose the EHR option (A or B) that yields the lower risk.\n\nLet's analyze the risk as a function of the dose $D$:\n- Case 1: The dose $D$ is a non-integer value.\n  Any dose $D \\in [0.6, 1) \\cup (1, 1.2]$ is a non-integer. Such a dose requires a decimal point in its representation (e.g., $0.7~\\mathrm{mg}$, $1.2~\\mathrm{mg}$).\n  - With Option A (free-text), the risk is $p_{\\mathrm{dec,free}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n  - With Option B (structured), the risk is $p_{\\mathrm{dec,str}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n  The minimum risk for any non-integer dose is achieved with Option B, so $P(\\text{error} | D \\text{ is non-integer}) = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n\n- Case 2: The dose $D$ is an integer value.\n  We must check if any integer values fall within the therapeutic range $D \\in [0.6, 1.2]~\\mathrm{mg}$. The only integer in this interval is $D=1$.\n  - With Option A (free-text), an integer dose can be entered with a trailing zero (e.g., \"$1.0~\\mathrm{mg}$\"), which carries a risk of $p_{\\mathrm{trail}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}$. The system allows for this user error.\n  - With Option B (structured), an integer dose is displayed without a decimal point, and the risk is explicitly stated as $p_{\\mathrm{int}} = 0$.\n  The minimum risk for an integer dose is achieved with Option B, so $P(\\text{error} | D=1) = 0$.\n\nComparing the minimum achievable risks, we have:\n$$ P(\\text{error}) = \\begin{cases} 0 & \\text{if } D=1~\\mathrm{mg} \\\\ 5.0 \\times 10^{-4} & \\text{if } D \\in [0.6, 1) \\cup (1, 1.2] \\end{cases} $$\nThe global minimum risk is $0$, which is uniquely achieved at the dose $D = 1~\\mathrm{mg}$. Since this dose is unique, the tie-breaker rule is not invoked.\n\nThe optimal dose is $1~\\mathrm{mg}$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to one significant figure. The number $1$ has one significant figure.\nTherefore, the final answer is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "5198093"}, {"introduction": "A core task in quality improvement is distinguishing meaningful signals from random noise in data over time.

Determination of the baseline median and classification of subsequent data points.\n2.  Application of run chart signal detection rules.\n3.  Calculation of the specified probability under a random variation model.\n\n**1. Baseline Median and Data Classification**\n\nThe baseline period consists of the first $12$ weeks. The data for these weeks are:\n$$\n5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6\n$$\nTo find the median, the data must first be sorted in ascending order. The number of data points is $N = 12$.\nThe sorted baseline data are:\n$$\n5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6\n$$\nSince $N$ is an even number, the median is the arithmetic mean of the two middle values, which are the $\\frac{N}{2}$-th and $(\\frac{N}{2} + 1)$-th values in the sorted list. These correspond to the $6$-th and $7$-th values.\n$$\n\\text{Median} = \\frac{\\text{Value}_6 + \\text{Value}_7}{2} = \\frac{5 + 6}{2} = 5.5\n$$\nThe baseline median is $5.5$ CLABSI-free days.\n\nNext, we classify the data points from weeks $13$–$24$ as being \"above\" (A) or \"below\" (B) this median. Points equal to the median are to be omitted, but in this case, all data points are integers ($5$ or $6$) and will not be equal to the median of $5.5$.\n\nThe data for weeks $13$–$24$ are: $6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 5$.\n- Week $13$: $6 > 5.5$ (A)\n- Week $14$: $6 > 5.5$ (A)\n- Week $15$: $6 > 5.5$ (A)\n- Week $16$: $6 > 5.5$ (A)\n- Week $17$: $6 > 5.5$ (A)\n- Week $18$: $6 > 5.5$ (A)\n- Week $19$: $6 > 5.5$ (A)\n- Week $20$: $6 > 5.5$ (A)\n- Week $21$: $5  5.5$ (B)\n- Week $22$: $6 > 5.5$ (A)\n- Week $23$: $6 > 5.5$ (A)\n- Week $24$: $5  5.5$ (B)\n\nThe resulting sequence for weeks $13$–$24$ is: A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, B, A, A, B.\n\n**2. Run Chart Signal Detection**\n\nWe analyze the sequence A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, B, A, A, B for standard non-random signals.\n\n- **Shift:** A \"shift\" is defined as $8$ consecutive points on the same side of the median. The data for weeks $13$ through $20$ are all classified as \"Above\" (A). This constitutes a run of $8$ consecutive points above the median. Therefore, a shift signal is present, indicating a non-random change in the process centered around week $20$.\n\n- **Trend:** A \"trend\" is defined as $6$ consecutive strictly increasing or strictly decreasing points. The raw data sequence for weeks $13$–$24$ is $6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 5$. There are no sequences of $6$ points that are strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. The longest such sequences are of length $2$ (e.g., $6, 5$ at weeks $20$–$21$ and $5, 6$ at weeks $21$–$22$). Therefore, no trend signal is detected.\n\n- **Too Few/Many Runs:** A run is a sequence of one or more consecutive points on the same side of the median. We count the number of times the data sequence crosses the median.\nThe classified sequence is `A A A A A A A A | B | A A | B`.\n- Run 1: 8 points above (A)\n- Run 2: 1 point below (B)\n- Run 3: 2 points above (A)\n- Run 4: 1 point below (B)\nThere are a total of $4$ runs in the $12$-week observation period. For a random process with $12$ data points not on the median, this number is qualitatively low, suggesting a systematic pattern (in this case, the shift). This constitutes a \"too few runs\" signal.\n\n**3. Probability Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to calculate the probability that the specific contiguous block of $8$ weeks (weeks $13$–$20$) would all lie on the same side of the baseline median, assuming a null model of random variation.\n\nUnder the null model:\n- Each weekly data point has a probability $p = 1/2$ of being above the true median and $1-p = 1/2$ of being below it.\n- The outcomes for each week are independent (modeled as independent Bernoulli trials).\n\nThe event of interest, $E$, is that all $8$ data points from week $13$ to week $20$ are on the *same side* of the median. This means they are either all \"Above\" OR all \"Below\". Let $E_A$ be the event that all $8$ points are \"Above\", and $E_B$ be the event that all $8$ points are \"Below\".\n$$\nE = E_A \\cup E_B\n$$\nSince $E_A$ and $E_B$ are mutually exclusive events, the probability of $E$ is the sum of their individual probabilities:\n$$\nP(E) = P(E_A) + P(E_B)\n$$\nThe probability that a single point is \"Above\" is $P(\\text{Above}) = 1/2$. Due to independence, the probability that all $8$ points are \"Above\" is:\n$$\nP(E_A) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^8\n$$\nSimilarly, the probability that a single point is \"Below\" is $P(\\text{Below}) = 1/2$. The probability that all $8$ points are \"Below\" is:\n$$\nP(E_B) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^8\n$$\nTherefore, the total probability is:\n$$\nP(E) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^8 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^8 = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^8 = \\frac{2}{2^8} = \\frac{1}{2^7}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\nP(E) = \\frac{1}{128} = 0.0078125\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is $7$. The next three are $8$, $1$, and $2$. The fifth significant figure is $5$, which requires rounding up the fourth significant figure.\n$$\nP(E) \\approx 0.007813\n$$\nThis probability corresponds to the conventional threshold ($p  0.01$) used for detecting a shift signal on a run chart.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.007813}\n$$", "id": "5198087"}, {"introduction": "Effective quality improvement is driven by iterative learning, and the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle is the engine for this work.

The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of this problem lies in correctly interpreting the results of the first PDSA cycle using the fundamental principles of the Model for Improvement. A critical distinction in this methodology is between a **theory failure** and an **execution failure**.\n\n1.  **Defining Theory vs. Execution:**\n    *   A **theory of change** is the underlying hypothesis that a specific change will lead to a desired improvement. In this case, the theory is: \"Standardized teach-back using a $5$-step checklist will improve caregivers' MDI technique.\"\n    *   **Execution** refers to the degree to which the planned change was actually implemented. The **process measure** is designed specifically to quantify this.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Measures:**\n    *   **Outcome Measure:** The baseline data ($45\\%$, $40\\%$, $47\\%$, $44\\%$) establish a stable process with a mean of $\\frac{45+40+47+44}{4} = 44\\%$. During the PDSA cycle, the results were $43\\%$ and $41\\%$. These values fall within the range of a common-cause variation of the baseline. There is no statistically significant improvement; the change, as tested, had no effect on the outcome.\n    *   **Process Measure:** This is the most critical piece of data for interpretation. The process measure, which tracks the completion of the checklist, was only $21\\%$ and $27\\%$ during the PDSA weeks. This means that the intended change (the standardized teach-back with the checklist) was only executed in a small minority of cases. In approximately $75\\%$ of discharges, the intervention did not happen as planned.\n    *   **Balancing Measure:** The teaching time increased by $17 - 14 = 3$ minutes. This is a negative consequence, suggesting the new process, even when attempted, adds burden.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Data and Classifying the Failure:**\n    *   We cannot evaluate the validity of the change theory if the change itself is not being performed. Since the process measure is very low, the team did not successfully execute the intervention. The lack of improvement in the outcome measure is a direct result of the intervention not being implemented.\n    *   Therefore, this is a classic **execution failure**, not a theory failure. The hypothesis that the checklist can improve skills remains untested because the checklist was not used.\n    *   The qualitative feedback from the nurses provides a clear explanation for this execution failure: the paper-based tool was poorly integrated into the workflow, inaccessible, and staff were not trained on its use.\n\n4.  **Determining the Next Appropriate Step:**\n    *   According to the PDSA methodology, when an execution failure is identified, the next step is *not* to abandon the theory. Instead, the next cycle must focus on improving the reliability of the execution. The goal should be to redesign the process to address the barriers identified in the \"Study\" phase.\n    *   The next PDSA cycle should aim to make the process more reliable (increase the process measure) by making it easier for the nurses to perform the change correctly. This involves directly addressing the feedback: making the tool accessible (e.g., integrating into the EHR), providing training, and ensuring it works within the real-world clinical workflow. The test should remain small in scope (e.g., a few shifts, one team) to allow for rapid learning. Only after achieving high reliability on the process measure can the team re-evaluate the outcome measure to test the original theory.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Execution failure; next test should increase reliability by integrating the $5$-step checklist into the EHR discharge navigator with an automated prompt, provide brief just-in-time training, and test on one team on the next $2$ shifts to raise the process measure before reassessing the outcome.**\n*   **Classification:** Correctly identifies the issue as an **execution failure**, supported by the low process measure.\n*   **Proposed Action:** The proposed next steps directly address the root causes of the execution failure identified in the qualitative data. Integrating the checklist into the EHR solves the accessibility problem (\"distant workroom,\" \"difficult to find\"). Providing just-in-time training addresses the lack of practice. Testing on a small scale (\"one team on the next $2$ shifts\") adheres to the principle of rapid-cycle iteration. The stated goal (\"to raise the process measure before reassessing the outcome\") is the methodologically correct focus.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Theory failure; abandon teach-back and immediately switch to a new change idea (pre-discharge video modules for all families) across the unit to seek outcome improvement.**\n*   **Classification:** Incorrectly classifies the problem as a **theory failure**. This conclusion is unsupported because the theory was never adequately tested due to poor execution.\n*   **Proposed Action:** Abandoning the current idea is premature. Switching to a completely new idea represents \"solution jumping\" rather than iterative, sequential learning. Implementing it \"across the unit\" is an inappropriate scaling of an untested idea, violating the core PDSA principle of small-scale testing.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Measurement artifact; change the primary outcome to $30$-day readmissions for asthma and expand measurement to all respiratory diagnoses to increase sample size before deciding on next steps.**\n*   **Classification:** Incorrectly attributes the result to a **measurement artifact**. There is no evidence that the measurement system is flawed. The lack of change in the outcome is explained by the low process adherence, not a faulty measurement.\n*   **Proposed Action:** Changing the outcome to $30$-day readmissions is inadvisable for a rapid-cycle test of a specific educational intervention. Readmissions are a lagging, multifactorial outcome, making it difficult to detect a signal from a single process change. The original outcome (skill demonstration) is a much more sensitive and direct measure. Expanding the population to all respiratory diagnoses introduces heterogeneity that would likely obscure, rather than clarify, any effect.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Execution failure; spread the current paper checklist and leaflet hospital-wide to increase exposure and statistical power, then re-evaluate after $8$ more weeks.**\n*   **Classification:** Correctly identifies the issue as an **execution failure**.\n*   **Proposed Action:** The proposed action is fundamentally flawed. Spreading a process that is known to have failed on a small scale is a recipe for widespread failure and staff burnout. The principle of QI is to test and refine an idea until it works reliably on a small scale *before* spreading it. This proposal does the opposite. The invocation of \"statistical power\" is a misapplication of the concept; the problem is not a small effect size, but a lack of intervention implementation.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5198055"}]}
