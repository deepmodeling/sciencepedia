Each subtest yields a scaled score that has been normed to a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 3 in the reference population for this age band. The clinic’s procedure is to: (i) convert each scaled score to a percentile rank using an age-band normative table, (ii) transform each percentile rank to a standard normal deviate (a $z$-score) using the inverse cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, and (iii) form a weighted composite from the three correlated $z$-scores, then standardize that composite to a $z$-metric using the known inter-subtest correlation structure. The clinic defines the clinical cutoff for developmental delay as a composite $z$-score less than or equal to $-2$, consistent with conventional interpretations of scores at or below two standard deviations under the assumption of approximate normality.\n\nYou are given:\n- Child’s subtest scaled scores:\n  - RL scaled score $= 6$,\n  - EL scaled score $= 7$,\n  - VR scaled score $= 8$.\n- Normative table entries (for this age band) mapping scaled scores to percentile ranks (expressed as decimals):\n  - Scaled score $6 \\mapsto$ percentile rank $0.0912$,\n  - Scaled score $7 \\mapsto$ percentile rank $0.1587$,\n  - Scaled score $8 \\mapsto$ percentile rank $0.2525$.\n- The composite is computed as a weighted linear combination of the three subtest $z$-scores with weights\n  $$w_{\\mathrm{RL}} = 0.40,\\quad w_{\\mathrm{EL}} = 0.35,\\quad w_{\\mathrm{VR}} = 0.25,$$\n  followed by standardization using the inter-subtest correlation matrix\n  $$R = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  1 & 0.60 & 0.50 \\\\\n  0.60 & 1 & 0.55 \\\\\n  0.50 & 0.55 & 1\n  \\end{pmatrix}.$$\n- The clinical cutoff for developmental delay is defined as a composite $z$-score $\\leq -2$.\n\nStarting only from fundamental definitions and well-tested facts (for example, the definition of percentile rank, the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, and variance of a linear combination of correlated variables), do the following: convert each scaled score to a percentile using the provided table, convert each percentile to a $z$-score, construct the weighted composite and standardize it to a composite $z$-score using the provided correlation matrix, and then compute the signed margin\n$\\Delta \\equiv z_{\\mathrm{composite}} - (-2),$\nso that a positive $\\Delta$ indicates the child’s composite exceeds (is above) the developmental delay cutoff and a negative $\\Delta$ indicates it is below the cutoff.\n\nRound your final numeric answer for $\\Delta$ to four significant figures.

This calculation involves a sequence of statistical transformations. We shall proceed by formalizing and executing each step as described in the problem statement, adhering to fundamental principles of psychometrics and statistics.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem.\nThe givens are:\n- Subtest scaled scores: $S_{\\mathrm{RL}} = 6$, $S_{\\mathrm{EL}} = 7$, $S_{\\mathrm{VR}} = 8$.\n- Normative data for scaled scores: population mean $\\mu=10$, population standard deviation $\\sigma=3$.\n- Mapping from scaled scores to percentile ranks ($p$):\n  - $S=6 \\mapsto p=0.0912$\n  - $S=7 \\mapsto p=0.1587$\n  - $S=8 \\mapsto p=0.2525$\n- Weights for the composite score: $w_{\\mathrm{RL}} = 0.40$, $w_{\\mathrm{EL}} = 0.35$, $w_{\\mathrm{VR}} = 0.25$.\n- Inter-subtest correlation matrix for the corresponding $z$-scores:\n$$R = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0.60 & 0.50 \\\\\n0.60 & 1 & 0.55 \\\\\n0.50 & 0.55 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n- Clinical cutoff: composite $z$-score $\\leq -2$.\n- Task: Compute $\\Delta \\equiv z_{\\mathrm{composite}} - (-2)$ and round to four significant figures.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, using standard statistical procedures common in psychometric assessment. It is well-posed, providing all necessary data for a unique solution. The provided data are internally consistent. For a normal distribution with mean $\\mu=10$ and standard deviation $\\sigma=3$, the standard scores ($z$) corresponding to the given scaled scores ($S$) are $z = (S-\\mu)/\\sigma$.\n- For $S=6$, $z=(6-10)/3 = -4/3$. The percentile is $P(Z \\le -4/3) \\approx 0.0912$, which matches the provided data.\n- For $S=7$, $z=(7-10)/3 = -1$. The percentile is $P(Z \\le -1) \\approx 0.1587$, which matches the provided data.\n- For $S=8$, $z=(8-10)/3 = -2/3$. The percentile is $P(Z \\le -2/3) \\approx 0.2525$, which matches the provided data.\nThe problem is therefore valid. We may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe process consists of five main steps:\n1. Convert each subtest's percentile rank to a standard normal deviate ($z$-score).\n2. Calculate the unstandardized weighted composite score.\n3. Determine the variance and standard deviation of the weighted composite score distribution.\n4. Standardize the child's composite score to obtain $z_{\\mathrm{composite}}$.\n5. Compute the signed margin $\\Delta$.\n\nStep 1: Conversion of Percentile Ranks to $z$-scores\nA percentile rank $p$ is converted to a standard normal deviate, or $z$-score, using the inverse of the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF), denoted $\\Phi^{-1}(p)$. The subtest $z$-scores for Receptive Language (RL), Expressive Language (EL), and Visual–Spatial Reasoning (VR) are denoted $z_{\\mathrm{RL}}$, $z_{\\mathrm{EL}}$, and $z_{\\mathrm{VR}}$, respectively.\n- $p_{\\mathrm{RL}} = 0.0912 \\implies z_{\\mathrm{RL}} = \\Phi^{-1}(0.0912)$\n- $p_{\\mathrm{EL}} = 0.1587 \\implies z_{\\mathrm{EL}} = \\Phi^{-1}(0.1587)$\n- $p_{\\mathrm{VR}} = 0.2525 \\implies z_{\\mathrm{VR}} = \\Phi^{-1}(0.2525)$\n\nAs established during validation, these percentile ranks correspond precisely to the theoretical percentiles for $z$-scores of $-4/3$, $-1$, and $-2/3$. We will use these exact fractional values to maintain precision.\n- $z_{\\mathrm{RL}} = -\\frac{4}{3}$\n- $z_{\\mathrm{EL}} = -1$\n- $z_{\\mathrm{VR}} = -\\frac{2}{3}$\n\nStep 2: Calculation of the Weighted Composite Score\nThe unstandardized composite score, which we shall call $C$, is a linear combination of the individual subtest $z$-scores, weighted by $w_{\\mathrm{RL}}$, $w_{\\mathrm{EL}}$, and $w_{\\mathrm{VR}}$.\n$$C = w_{\\mathrm{RL}} z_{\\mathrm{RL}} + w_{\\mathrm{EL}} z_{\\mathrm{EL}} + w_{\\mathrm{VR}} z_{\\mathrm{VR}}$$\nSubstituting the weights and $z$-scores:\n$$C = (0.40)\\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right) + (0.35)(-1) + (0.25)\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)$$\nWe can express the decimal weights as fractions for clarity: $w_{\\mathrm{RL}}=2/5$, $w_{\\mathrm{EL}}=7/20$, $w_{\\mathrm{VR}}=1/4$.\n$$C = \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{7}{20}\\right)(-1) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)$$\n$$C = -\\frac{8}{15} - \\frac{7}{20} - \\frac{2}{12} = -\\frac{8}{15} - \\frac{7}{20} - \\frac{1}{6}$$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $60$.\n$$C = -\\frac{8 \\times 4}{60} - \\frac{7 \\times 3}{60} - \\frac{1 \\times 10}{60} = \\frac{-32 - 21 - 10}{60} = \\frac{-63}{60} = -\\frac{21}{20}$$\n$$C = -1.05$$\n\nStep 3: Variance of the Weighted Composite Score\nTo standardize the composite score $C$, we must first determine its mean ($\\mu_C$) and standard deviation ($\\sigma_C$) in the reference population. Since each subtest $z$-score ($z_{\\mathrm{RL}}, z_{\\mathrm{EL}}, z_{\\mathrm{VR}}$) is a standard normal deviate, each has a mean of $0$ and a variance of $1$.\nThe mean of the composite score is the weighted sum of the means of the individual $z$-scores:\n$$\\mu_C = E[C] = E[w_{\\mathrm{RL}} z_{\\mathrm{RL}} + w_{\\mathrm{EL}} z_{\\mathrm{EL}} + w_{\\mathrm{VR}} z_{\\mathrm{VR}}] = w_{\\mathrm{RL}} E[z_{\\mathrm{RL}}] + w_{\\mathrm{EL}} E[z_{\\mathrm{EL}}] + w_{\\mathrm{VR}} E[z_{\\mathrm{VR}}]$$\n$$\\mu_C = (0.40)(0) + (0.35)(0) + (0.25)(0) = 0$$\nThe variance of the composite score, $\\sigma_C^2$, for a linear combination of correlated variables is given by $\\sigma_C^2 = \\mathbf{w}^T R \\mathbf{w}$, where $\\mathbf{w}$ is the vector of weights and $R$ is the correlation matrix.

The first four significant figures are $7, 5, 3, 2$. The fifth digit is $2$, so we round down.\n$$\\Delta \\approx 0.7532$$\nThe positive value of $\\Delta$ indicates that the child's composite score is above the clinical cutoff for developmental delay.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7532}$$", "id": "5120449"}, {"introduction": "Beyond assessing a child's current abilities, a key goal in pediatrics is to understand and predict developmental trajectories based on early life factors.

This is denoted by $P(H_{c} \\mid D)$. We will use Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(H_{c} \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\mid H_{c}) P(H_{c})}{P(D)} $$\nTo solve this, we must compute three terms: the prior $P(H_{c})$, the likelihood $P(D \\mid H_{c})$, and the evidence (or marginal likelihood) $P(D)$.\n\nThe prior probability for the color-based hypothesis is given as:\n$$ P(H_{c}) = 0.4 $$\n\nThe likelihood of the data $D$ given hypothesis $H_{c}$ is $P(D \\mid H_{c})$. The data $D$ consists of two events: $D_1$ (red sphere is a \"blicket\") and $D_2$ (red cube is a \"blicket\"). The problem states that these events are conditionally independent given a hypothesis. Therefore:\n$$ P(D \\mid H_{c}) = P(D_1 \\cap D_2 \\mid H_{c}) = P(D_1 \\mid H_{c}) \\times P(D_2 \\mid H_{c}) $$\nUnder hypothesis $H_{c}$, category membership is determined by color. Both exemplars are red. The probability that a red object is labeled a \"blicket\" is $0.85$.\n$$ P(D_1 \\mid H_{c}) = P(\\text{labeled \"blicket\"} \\mid \\text{red sphere}, H_{c}) = P(\\text{labeled \"blicket\"} \\mid \\text{red object}, H_{c}) = 0.85 $$\n$$ P(D_2 \\mid H_{c}) = P(\\text{labeled \"blicket\"} \\mid \\text{red cube}, H_{c}) = P(\\text{labeled \"blicket\"} \\mid \\text{red object}, H_{c}) = 0.85 $$\nThus, the likelihood of the data under $H_{c}$ is:\n$$ P(D \\mid H_{c}) = 0.85 \\times 0.85 = (0.85)^{2} = 0.7225 $$\n\nThe final term needed is the evidence, $P(D)$, which is the total probability of observing the data. We compute this using the law of total probability, summing over all hypotheses in our space {$H_{s}, H_{c}$}:\n$$ P(D) = P(D \\mid H_{s})P(H_{s}) + P(D \\mid H_{c})P(H_{c}) $$\nWe have already calculated $P(D \\mid H_{c})$ and are given $P(H_{s}) = 0.6$ and $P(H_{c}) = 0.4$. We must now calculate the likelihood $P(D \\mid H_{s})$.\n$$ P(D \\mid H_{s}) = P(D_1 \\cap D_2 \\mid H_{s}) = P(D_1 \\mid H_{s}) \\times P(D_2 \\mid H_{s}) $$\nUnder hypothesis $H_{s}$, category membership is determined by shape. The first exemplar is a sphere and the second is a cube.\n$$ P(D_1 \\mid H_{s}) = P(\\text{labeled \"blicket\"} \\mid \\text{red sphere}, H_{s}) = P(\\text{labeled \"blicket\"} \\mid \\text{sphere}, H_{s}) = 0.9 $$\n$$ P(D_2 \\mid H_{s}) = P(\\text{labeled \"blicket\"} \\mid \\text{red cube}, H_{s}) = P(\\text{labeled \"blicket\"} \\mid \\text{cube}, H_{s}) = 0.2 $$\nThus, the likelihood of the data under $H_{s}$ is:\n$$ P(D \\mid H_{s}) = 0.9 \\times 0.2 = 0.18 $$\nNow we can compute the evidence $P(D)$:\n$$ P(D) = (0.18)(0.6) + (0.7225)(0.4) $$\n$$ P(D) = 0.108 + 0.289 = 0.397 $$\n\nFinally, we can compute the posterior probability $P(H_{c} \\mid D)$ by substituting the values into Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(H_{c} \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\mid H_{c}) P(H_{c})}{P(D)} = \\frac{(0.7225)(0.4)}{0.397} = \\frac{0.289}{0.397} $$\n$$ P(H_{c} \\mid D) \\approx 0.72795969773... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P(H_{c} \\mid D) \\approx 0.7280 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7280}$$", "id": "5120477"}]}
