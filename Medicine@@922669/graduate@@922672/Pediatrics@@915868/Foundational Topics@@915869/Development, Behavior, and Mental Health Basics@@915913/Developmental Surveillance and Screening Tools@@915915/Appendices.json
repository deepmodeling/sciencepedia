Before any formal screening, a clinician integrates various risk factors—such as prematurity or family history—to form a baseline estimate of a child's likelihood of developmental delay.

Use only the following fundamental elements from probability and epidemiology: (i) the definition of pretest probability as a prior probability, (ii) the law of total probability summing over mutually exclusive strata, and (iii) the definition of relative risk as a multiplicative change in absolute risk relative to a specified baseline.\n\nAssume a binary risk-factor model with three pediatric factors: prematurity, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) stay, and first-degree family history of developmental delay. Let the baseline absolute risk (no risk factors present) be $p_{0}$. Let the relative risks (multiplicative on the risk scale) for the presence of prematurity, NICU stay, and family history be $R_{P}$, $R_{N}$, and $R_{F}$, respectively. For any stratum encoded by the binary vector $(x_{P}, x_{N}, x_{F}) \\in \\{0,1\\}^{3}$, the absolute risk is modeled as $p_{0}$ multiplied by the product of the applicable relative risks according to the factor presence.\n\nIn a specific clinic population, patients are distributed across the $8$ mutually exclusive strata with the following weights that sum to $1$: no risk factors $(0,0,0)$ has weight $w_{000}$, prematurity only $(1,0,0)$ has $w_{100}$, NICU only $(0,1,0)$ has $w_{010}$, family history only $(0,0,1)$ has $w_{001}$, prematurity and NICU $(1,1,0)$ has $w_{110}$, prematurity and family history $(1,0,1)$ has $w_{101}$, NICU and family history $(0,1,1)$ has $w_{011}$, and all three $(1,1,1)$ has $w_{111}$.\n\nGiven the scientifically plausible parameterization\n- $p_{0} = 0.08$,\n- $R_{P} = 2.0$, $R_{N} = 1.6$, $R_{F} = 1.5$,\n- $w_{000} = 0.61$, $w_{100} = 0.08$, $w_{010} = 0.06$, $w_{001} = 0.10$, $w_{110} = 0.05$, $w_{101} = 0.04$, $w_{011} = 0.035$, $w_{111} = 0.025$,\n\nderive from first principles how the clinic-wide pretest probability is obtained as a weighted sum over strata, and then calculate its numerical value for this clinic.

This quantity is the overall or marginal probability of the event of developmental delay in the entire clinic population. We are instructed to derive this from first principles, specifically the law of total probability.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a randomly selected child from the clinic has a global developmental delay. The clinic population is partitioned into $8$ mutually exclusive and exhaustive strata, based on the presence or absence of three risk factors: prematurity ($P$), NICU stay ($N$), and family history ($F$). We can denote each stratum $S_{ijk}$ by a binary vector $(i, j, k)$, where $i, j, k \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ indicate the absence ($0$) or presence ($1$) of factors $P$, $N$, and $F$, respectively.\n\nThe law of total probability states that the total probability of an event $D$ can be calculated by summing its conditional probabilities over a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events, $\\{S_{ijk}\\}$:\n$$ P(D) = \\sum_{i,j,k \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(D | S_{ijk}) P(S_{ijk}) $$\nWe must now relate the terms in this formula to the information provided in the problem.\n\n$1$. $P(S_{ijk})$ is the probability that a child belongs to stratum $S_{ijk}$. This is given by the stratum weights, $w_{ijk}$. For example, $P(S_{000}) = w_{000}$.\n\n$2$. $P(D | S_{ijk})$ is the conditional probability of developmental delay given that a child is in stratum $S_{ijk}$. The problem defines this as the absolute risk for that stratum, which we will denote as $p_{ijk}$.\n\nThe problem provides a model for calculating this stratum-specific risk. The baseline absolute risk (for the stratum with no risk factors, $S_{000}$) is $p_{0}$. The presence of each risk factor multiplies this baseline risk by a corresponding relative risk ($R_{P}$, $R_{N}$, or $R_{F}$). The risk for a stratum $S_{ijk}$ is therefore:\n$$ p_{ijk} = P(D | S_{ijk}) = p_{0} \\cdot R_{P}^{i} \\cdot R_{N}^{j} \\cdot R_{F}^{k} $$\nHere, the exponents $i, j, k$ are either $0$ or $1$, which elegantly captures the multiplicative effect of the \"applicable\" relative risks. For example, for a child with prematurity only, corresponding to stratum $S_{100}$, the risk is $p_{100} = p_{0} \\cdot R_{P}^{1} \\cdot R_{N}^{0} \\cdot R_{F}^{0} = p_{0} R_{P}$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions for $P(S_{ijk})$ and $P(D | S_{ijk})$ into the law of total probability, we obtain the formula for the clinic-wide pretest probability, $P(D)$:\n$$ P(D) = \\sum_{i,j,k \\in \\{0,1\\}} (p_{0} \\cdot R_{P}^{i} \\cdot R_{N}^{j} \\cdot R_{F}^{k}) \\cdot w_{ijk} $$\nWe can factor out the common term $p_{0}$:\n$$ P(D) = p_{0} \\sum_{i,j,k \\in \\{0,1\\}} (R_{P}^{i} \\cdot R_{N}^{j} \\cdot R_{F}^{k}) \\cdot w_{ijk} $$\nExpanding the sum into its $8$ constituent terms:\n$$ P(D) = p_{0} [ (R_{P}^{0}R_{N}^{0}R_{F}^{0})w_{000} + (R_{P}^{1}R_{N}^{0}R_{F}^{0})w_{100} + (R_{P}^{0}R_{N}^{1}R_{F}^{0})w_{010} + (R_{P}^{0}R_{N}^{0}R_{F}^{1})w_{001} + (R_{P}^{1}R_{N}^{1}R_{F}^{0})w_{110} + (R_{P}^{1}R_{N}^{0}R_{F}^{1})w_{101} + (R_{P}^{0}R_{N}^{1}R_{F}^{1})w_{011} + (R_{P}^{1}R_{N}^{1}R_{F}^{1})w_{111} ] $$\nSimplifying the exponents:\n$$ P(D) = p_{0} [ w_{000} + R_{P}w_{100} + R_{N}w_{010} + R_{F}w_{001} + R_{P}R_{N}w_{110} + R_{P}R_{F}w_{101} + R_{N}R_{F}w_{011} + R_{P}R_{N}R_{F}w_{111} ] $$\nThis equation represents the derived formula for the clinic-wide pretest probability.

Do not use a percentage sign.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the posterior probability that a child's \"suspect\" developmental screening result is incorrect, given the operating characteristics of the screening test and the prevalence of the condition in the population. The solution proceeds in two stages: first, validating the child's classification based on the provided data and rules, and second, applying Bayes' theorem to compute the desired probability.\n\nFirst, we must confirm the child's classification. The problem states that a child aged $24$ months has $15$ administered test items with $12$ passes and $3$ fails. The failures are specified as: one \"delay,\" one \"caution,\" and one failure that is neither. The rules for DDST-II interpretation are given as:\n- \"Normal\": no delays and at most one caution.\n- \"Suspect\": one or more delays and/or two or more cautions.\n- \"Untestable\": refusals preclude interpretation.\n\nThe child has one delay and one caution. According to the rule for a \"suspect\" classification, the condition \"one or more delays\" is met. Therefore, the child's DDST-II result is correctly categorized as \"suspect.\" This corresponds to a positive screen.\n\nNext, we formalize the probabilistic portion of the problem. Let $D$ be the event that the child has a true \"global developmental delay,\" and let $D^c$ be the complement event, that the child does not have a true delay. Let $T$ represent the event of a positive test result (a \"suspect\" classification), and let $T^c$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n1.  The prevalence of the condition: $P(D) = \\pi = 0.15$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test: $P(T|D) = \\alpha = 0.80$. This is the probability of a positive test given the presence of the condition (True Positive Rate).\n3.  The specificity of the test: $P(T^c|D^c) = \\beta = 0.90$. This is the probability of a negative test given the absence of the condition (True Negative Rate).\n\nFrom these givens, we can derive two additional probabilities:\n- The probability of not having the condition: $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\pi = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$.\n- The probability of a positive test given the absence of the condition (False Positive Rate): $P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - \\beta = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\nThe question asks for the posterior probability that the child's DDST-II classification is incorrect, given the observed \"suspect\" screen. A \"suspect\" screen is a positive test result, event $T$. An incorrect classification for a positive screen implies that the child does not actually have the condition, which is event $D^c$. Therefore, the quantity to be calculated is the posterior probability $P(D^c|T)$.\n\nWe use Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$P(D^c|T) = \\frac{P(T|D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, is the overall probability of a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, summing over the mutually exclusive scenarios of having the condition or not:\n$$P(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write:\n$$P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$$\n\nSubstituting the symbolic variables given in the problem:\n$$P(T) = \\alpha \\pi + (1-\\beta)(1-\\pi)$$\n\nNow we can write the full expression for the desired posterior probability, $P(D^c|T)$:\n$$P(D^c|T) = \\frac{P(T|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)} = \\frac{(1-\\beta)(1-\\pi)}{\\alpha\\pi + (1-\\beta)(1-\\pi)}$$\n\nThis expression represents the probability of a false positive among all positive results, also known as the False Discovery Rate.
