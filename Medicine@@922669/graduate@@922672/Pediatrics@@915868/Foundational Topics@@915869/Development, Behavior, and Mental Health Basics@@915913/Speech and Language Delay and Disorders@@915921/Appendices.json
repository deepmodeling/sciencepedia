The use of normative data (mean $\\mu$, standard deviation $\\sigma$) and the calculation of a standard score (z-score) to quantify deviation from a population mean is a standard and fundamental practice in biostatistics, psychometrics, and developmental pediatrics. The assumption of an approximately normal distribution for a trait like vocabulary size is a common and accepted simplification in these fields, particularly when the mean is sufficiently large. The provided values are clinically plausible.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary quantitative information ($X$, $\\mu$, $\\sigma$) to calculate the requested value ($z$). The formula for a z-score is universally defined, leading to a unique and meaningful solution. The qualitative information (e.g., \"absence of $2$-word combinations\") provides clinical context but does not introduce contradictions or ambiguity into the mathematical task.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated with objective and precise language. It presents data and requests a specific calculation based on a standard statistical transformation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the computation of a standardized deviation value, which is formally known as a standard score or a z-score. The z-score quantifies the number of standard deviations a particular data point is from the population mean.\n\nThe formula for calculating the z-score is:\n$$z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\nwhere:\n- $X$ is the individual raw score.\n- $\\mu$ is the population mean.\n- $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following values:\n- The child's raw expressive vocabulary size is $X = 5$.\n- The population mean vocabulary size for this age is $\\mu = 50$.\n- The population standard deviation is $\\sigma = 15$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the z-score formula:\n$$z = \\frac{5 - 50}{15}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the difference in the numerator, which represents the deviation of the score from the mean:\n$$5 - 50 = -45$$\n\nNext, we divide this deviation by the standard deviation:\n$$z = \\frac{-45}{15}$$\n\nPerforming the division gives the final z-score:\n$$z = -3$$\n\nThis result indicates that the child's expressive vocabulary size of $5$ words is $3$ standard deviations below the mean for their age group. The negative sign signifies that the score is below the mean. The magnitude of $3$ indicates a severe degree of deviation. This quantitative result is consistent with the qualitative clinical description of a suspected expressive language delay.

The calculation of Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) is a standard, quantitative procedure in linguistics and speech-language pathology. The normative data cited (Roger Brown's stages of language development) is a foundational concept in the field of child language acquisition. The problem is firmly rooted in established scientific principles.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (total morphemes, total utterances) and a clear definition to compute the required quantity (MLU). The comparison is based on a provided, explicit set of norms. A unique solution exists.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated objectively, using precise terminology and quantitative data. It is free from subjective or opinion-based claims.\n- **Topic Relevance**: The problem directly addresses the evaluation of a potential *speech and language delay* in a child, which is a core topic within *pediatrics* and the specified sub-field.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, missing information, contradiction, or ambiguity. It is a formalizable and verifiable problem based on accepted clinical and scientific practices.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe primary task is to compute the Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) for the child and interpret this value in the context of the provided developmental norms.\n\nThe MLU is defined as the ratio of the total number of morphemes to the total number of utterances. Let $M$ represent the total morpheme count and $U$ represent the total utterance count. The formula for MLU is:\n$$ \\text{MLU} = \\frac{M}{U} $$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Total morphemes, $M = 240$.\n- Total utterances, $U = 60$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$ \\text{MLU} = \\frac{240}{60} $$\n\nPerforming the division yields the exact MLU:\n$$ \\text{MLU} = 4.0 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The value $4.0$ can be expressed as $4.00$ to meet this requirement.\n\nThe next step is the clinical interpretation. The child's chronological age is $42$ months. We must compare the computed MLU to the normative data for a child of this age. According to the provided data:\n- Stage V is associated with ages $41$ to $46$ months.\n- The expected MLU range for Stage V is from $3.75$ to $4.5$.\n\nThe child's chronological age of $42$ months falls squarely within the age range for Stage V. The child's computed MLU is $4.00$. To determine if this is within the expected range, we check the inequality:\n$$ 3.75 \\le 4.00 \\le 4.5 $$\n\nThis inequality is true. The child's calculated MLU of $4.00$ falls within the typical range of $3.75$ to $4.5$ morphemes for their age group. Therefore, based solely on the measure of Mean Length of Utterance, the child's syntactic complexity, as reflected by utterance length, is developing within the expected boundaries for their chronological age. There is no evidence of a language delay from this specific metric.

The premises are scientifically grounded in the established principles of diagnostic test evaluation and probability theory. All provided values are realistic for a clinical screening context.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a child has a clinically confirmed expressive language delay, and let $T^+$ be the event that the screening test result is positive. Our goal is to derive and compute the positive predictive value ($PPV$), which is the conditional probability $P(D|T^+)$.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are:\n1.  The prevalence of the disease, $\\pi = P(D) = 0.10$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test, $Se = P(T^+|D) = 0.85$. This is the probability of a positive test given that the child has the delay.\n3.  The specificity of the test, $Sp = P(T^-|D^c) = 0.80$, where $T^-$ is the event of a negative test and $D^c$ is the event that a child does not have the delay.\n\nFrom the prevalence, we can determine the probability of not having the delay:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\pi = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$$\n\nFrom the specificity, we can determine the probability of a positive test given that the child does not have the delay.
