Express the final corrected value in cells per microliter.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard pediatric clinical practice, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and stated objectively.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for a corrected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell (WBC) count, calculation of this value for a given clinical scenario, and interpretation of the result.\n\nFirst, let us define the variables involved:\nLet $WBC_{measured}$ be the measured WBC count in the CSF sample, which is a composite of the true WBCs and contaminant WBCs.\nLet $RBC_{measured}$ be the measured red blood cell (RBC) count in the CSF sample, assumed to be entirely from peripheral blood contamination during a traumatic tap.\nLet $WBC_{corrected}$ be the true, or corrected, CSF WBC count, representing the actual number of white blood cells native to the CSF.\nLet $WBC_{contaminant}$ be the number of WBCs in the sample that are present due to contamination from peripheral blood.\nLet $R$ be the empirical ratio used for correction, representing the number of WBCs contributed per RBC from peripheral blood.\n\nFrom these definitions, the measured WBC count can be expressed as the sum of the true count and the contaminant count:\n$$WBC_{measured} = WBC_{corrected} + WBC_{contaminant}$$\nThe objective is to find $WBC_{corrected}$. Rearranging the equation, we get:\n$$WBC_{corrected} = WBC_{measured} - WBC_{contaminant}$$\nThe number of contaminant WBCs is a direct result of the blood introduced during the traumatic tap, which is quantified by the measured RBC count. The problem states an empirical correction that attributes approximately $1$ CSF WBC per $500$ CSF RBCs to this contamination. This gives us the ratio:\n$$R = \\frac{1 \\text{ WBC}}{500 \\text{ RBC}}$$\nThe total number of contaminant WBCs can thus be estimated by multiplying this ratio by the total number of measured RBCs:\n$$WBC_{contaminant} = R \\times RBC_{measured}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $WBC_{contaminant}$ back into the equation for the corrected count yields the general expression for the corrected CSF WBC count derived from first principles:\n$$WBC_{corrected} = WBC_{measured} - \\left(R \\times RBC_{measured}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we will compute the value using the data provided in the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n$WBC_{measured} = 60 \\text{ cells}/\\mu L$\n$RBC_{measured} = 20,000 \\text{ cells}/\\mu L$\nThe correction ratio is $R = \\frac{1}{500}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the contaminant WBC count:\n$$WBC_{contaminant} = \\frac{1}{500} \\times 20,000 \\, \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\mu L} = \\frac{20,000}{500} \\, \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\mu L} = 40 \\, \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\mu L}$$\nNext, we calculate the corrected CSF WBC count by subtracting the contaminant count from the measured count:\n$$WBC_{corrected} = 60 \\, \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\mu L} - 40 \\, \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\mu L} = 20 \\, \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\mu L}$$\nThe problem asks for the numerical answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The calculated result is exactly $20$. In this context, the number $20$ represents a count with precision to the ones place, thus possessing two significant figures. No rounding is necessary.\n\nFinally, we must interpret this result. The corrected CSF WBC count is $20$ cells/µL. An elevated WBC count in the CSF is known as pleocytosis. For an infant aged $45$ days (i.e., older than $28$ days), the upper limit of the normal range for CSF WBCs is substantially lower than in the immediate neonatal period. Well-established pediatric references typically define pleocytosis in this age group as a WBC count greater than approximately $5-10$ cells/µL.\nThe calculated corrected count of $20$ cells/µL is clearly above this threshold. Therefore, the infant has CSF pleocytosis. In the clinical setting of fever and irritability, the presence of pleocytosis, even after performing the correction for a traumatic tap, significantly raises the clinical suspicion for bacterial meningitis.

Using Bayes theorem grounded in probability axioms, update the probability of IBI after a positive PCT and after a negative PCT. Then, apply a simple expected-loss decision framework for hospitalization: hospitalization carries a normalized disutility (cost) of $C_{H} = 0.1$, and if IBI is present, hospitalization reduces the harm of IBI by an efficacy factor $e = 0.8$ relative to the normalized harm of untreated IBI $H_{\\mathrm{IBI}} = 1.0$.

It is scientifically grounded in probability theory and decision analysis, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of givens, and objective in its formulation. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of three quantities: the posterior probability of invasive bacterial infection (IBI) given a positive procalcitonin (PCT) test, the posterior probability of IBI given a negative PCT test, and the decision threshold for hospitalization.\n\nLet $D$ denote the event that the infant has an IBI, and $\\neg D$ denote the event that the infant does not have an IBI.

The pre-test odds of IBI are given by:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{pre} = \\frac{P(D)}{1-P(D)} = \\frac{0.05}{0.95} = \\frac{5}{95} = \\frac{1}{19}\n$$\n\nThe posterior odds are found by multiplying the pre-test odds by the corresponding likelihood ratio.
