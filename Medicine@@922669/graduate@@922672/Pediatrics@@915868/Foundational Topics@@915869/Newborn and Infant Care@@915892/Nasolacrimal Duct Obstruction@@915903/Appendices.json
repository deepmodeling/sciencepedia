The tear fluid has dynamic viscosity $\\eta$, assumed constant. The ocular surface and conjunctival sac are treated as a well-mixed reservoir of fixed volume $V$ that drains only through the nasolacrimal duct; the clearance of a freely dissolved tracer follows first-order kinetics governed by mass conservation.

This involves combining principles of fluid dynamics (Hagen-Poiseuille flow) and pharmacokinetic modeling (first-order clearance from a well-mixed reservoir).\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between volumetric flow rate, $Q$, and the geometry of the duct. The problem states that tear flow is laminar through a cylindrical tube of length $L$ and radius $r$, driven by a constant pressure difference $\\Delta P$. This physical situation is described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P r^4}{8 \\eta L}\n$$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the tear fluid.\n\nWe are given two states: an unobstructed state and an obstructed state. Let the parameters for the unobstructed state be denoted by a subscript $0$ and for the obstructed state by a subscript $1$.\n\nIn the unobstructed state, the radius is $r_0$, and the volumetric flow rate is $Q_0$:\n$$\nQ_0 = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P r_0^4}{8 \\eta L}\n$$\n\nIn the obstructed state, the radius is reduced to $r_1$, resulting in a volumetric flow rate $Q_1$.

Let $C(t)$ be the concentration of the tracer in the reservoir at time $t$. The total mass of the tracer is $m(t) = V C(t)$. Drainage occurs only through the nasolacrimal duct with a volumetric flow rate $Q$. The rate of mass removal from the reservoir is the product of the concentration and the flow rate, $C(t) Q$.\n\nAccording to the principle of mass conservation, the rate of change of mass in the reservoir is equal to the negative of the rate of mass removal:\n$$\n\\frac{d m(t)}{dt} = -C(t) Q\n$$\nSince $m(t) = V C(t)$ and $V$ is a constant, we have:\n$$\nV \\frac{d C(t)}{dt} = -C(t) Q\n$$\nRearranging this gives a first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d C(t)}{dt} = -\\left(\\frac{Q}{V}\\right) C(t)\n$$\nThis equation describes first-order kinetics, as stated in the problem, with a rate constant $k = Q/V$.
