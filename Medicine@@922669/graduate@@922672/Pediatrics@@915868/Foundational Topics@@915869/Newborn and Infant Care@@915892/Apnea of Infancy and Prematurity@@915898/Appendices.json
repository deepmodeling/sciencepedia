Reduced arterial oxygen content lowers the oxygen reserve available to buffer transient hypoventilation, thereby accelerating desaturation during pauses and increasing the likelihood that hypoxic feedback destabilizes breathing. Consider two physiological states in the same preterm infant, identical except for hemoglobin concentration: an anemic state with hemoglobin $[Hb]=8$ g/dL and a non-anemic reference state with $[Hb]=12$ g/dL.
