Derivation of an Expression for Free Bilirubin ($B_{\\text{free}}$)**\n\nThe equilibrium reaction for the $1:1$ binding of free bilirubin ($B_{\\text{free}}$) to free albumin ($[\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{free}}$) to form the bilirubin-albumin complex ($B_{\\text{bound}}$) is:\n$$B_{\\text{free}} + [\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{free}} \\rightleftharpoons B_{\\text{bound}}$$\nBy the law of mass action, the association constant, $K_a$, is defined in terms of molar concentrations:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[B_{\\text{bound}}]}{[B_{\\text{free}}] [[\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{free}}]}$$\nwhere $[X]$ denotes the molar concentration of species $X$.\n\nThe conservation of mass for bilirubin states that the total bilirubin concentration, $B_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the free and bound concentrations:\n$$[B_{\\text{total}}] = [B_{\\text{free}}] + [B_{\\text{bound}}]$$\nThe problem provides a key simplifying assumption: the fraction of albumin occupied by bilirubin is small. This implies that the concentration of free albumin is approximately equal to the total albumin concentration:\n$$[[\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{free}}] \\approx [[\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{total}}]$$\nFor simplicity, we will use $[\\text{Alb}]$ to denote the total albumin concentration, $[[\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{total}}]$.\n\nSubstituting this assumption into the expression for $K_a$:\n$$K_a \\approx \\frac{[B_{\\text{bound}}]}{[B_{\\text{free}}] [\\text{Alb}]}$$\nWe can rearrange this to express the bound bilirubin concentration in terms of the free bilirubin concentration:\n$$[B_{\\text{bound}}] \\approx K_a [B_{\\text{free}}] [\\text{Alb}]$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[B_{\\text{bound}}]$ into the mass conservation equation for bilirubin:\n$$[B_{\\text{total}}] \\approx [B_{\\text{free}}] + K_a [B_{\\text{free}}] [\\text{Alb}]$$\nFactoring out $[B_{\\text{free}}]$ on the right-hand side gives:\n$$[B_{\\text{total}}] \\approx [B_{\\text{free}}] (1 + K_a [\\text{Alb}])$$\nFinally, solving for $[B_{\\text{free}}]$ yields the desired expression in terms of molar concentrations:\n$$[B_{\\text{free}}] \\approx \\frac{[B_{\\text{total}}]}{1 + K_a [\\text{Alb}]}$$\nThis relationship between concentrations is independent of the specific units used (e.g., $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, $\\mu\\mathrm{g/L}$), as long as $B_{\\text{free}}$ and $B_{\\text{total}}$ are in the same units. This is because the conversion factor from mass concentration to molar concentration (the molar mass of bilirubin, $M_B$) would appear in both the numerator and the denominator, thus canceling out. Let $\\{X\\}$ be the mass concentration of species $X$. Since $\\{X\\}=[X] \\cdot M_B$, we have:\n$$\\frac{\\{B_{\\text{free}}\\}}{M_B} \\approx \\frac{\\{B_{\\text{total}}\\}/M_B}{1 + K_a [\\text{Alb}]}$$\n$$\\{B_{\\text{free}}\\} \\approx \\frac{\\{B_{\\text{total}}\\}}{1 + K_a [\\text{Alb}]}$$\nTherefore, we can directly use the given mass concentration for $B_{\\text{total}}$ to find $B_{\\text{free}}$ in the same units, provided $[\\text{Alb}]$ is expressed in molar units ($\\mathrm{M}$) to make the term $K_a [\\text{Alb}]$ dimensionless.\n\n**2. Conversion of Albumin Concentration to Molar Units**\n\nWe are given the total albumin concentration $[\\text{Alb}] = 3.0 \\text{ g/dL}$ and the molar mass of HSA $M_{\\text{HSA}} = 66.5 \\text{ kDa}$.\n\nFirst, convert the molar mass to units of $\\mathrm{g/mol}$:\n$$M_{\\text{HSA}} = 66.5 \\text{ kDa} = 66.5 \\times 10^3 \\text{ Da} = 66.5 \\times 10^3 \\text{ g/mol} = 66500 \\text{ g/mol}$$\nNext, convert the albumin mass concentration from $\\mathrm{g/dL}$ to $\\mathrm{g/L}$:\n$$[\\text{Alb}] = 3.0 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{dL}} \\times \\frac{10 \\text{ dL}}{1 \\text{ L}} = 30.0 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{L}}$$\nFinally, convert the mass concentration in $\\mathrm{g/L}$ to molar concentration ($\\mathrm{mol/L}$, or $\\mathrm{M}$) using the molar mass:\n$$[\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{molar}} = \\frac{30.0\\ \\mathrm{g/L}}{66500\\ \\mathrm{g/mol}} = \\frac{30.0}{66500}\\ \\mathrm{M} = \\frac{3}{6650}\\ \\mathrm{M}$$\n$$[\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{molar}} \\approx 4.511278 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ M}$$\n\n**3. Calculation of Free Bilirubin Concentration ($B_{\\text{free}}$)**\n\nWe now use the derived expression with the given values. The denominator is a dimensionless factor.\n$$B_{\\text{free}} = \\frac{B_{\\text{total}}}{1 + K_a [\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{molar}}}$$\nGiven values are $B_{\\text{total}} = 18 \\text{ mg/dL}$ and $K_a = 1.00 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the value of the term $K_a [\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{molar}}$:\n$$K_a [\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{molar}} = (1.00 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{6650}\\ \\mathrm{M}\\right) = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{5}}{6650} = \\frac{3000}{66.5} = \\frac{6000}{133}$$\n$$K_a [\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{molar}} \\approx 45.11278$$\nNow, calculate the full denominator:\n$$1 + K_a [\\text{Alb}]_{\\text{molar}} = 1 + \\frac{6000}{133} = \\frac{133 + 6000}{133} = \\frac{6133}{133} \\approx 46.11278$$\nFinally, compute $B_{\\text{free}}$:\n$$B_{\\text{free}} = \\frac{18 \\text{ mg/dL}}{46.11278} \\approx 0.390347 \\text{ mg/dL}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$B_{\\text{free}} \\approx 0.390 \\text{ mg/dL}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.390}$$", "id": "5173869"}, {"introduction": "A key task in assessing a jaundiced neonate is to determine whether the bilirubin level is rising at a concerning velocity, which can signal an underlying pathologic process.
