Thermoregulation is maintained near the thermoneutral zone to minimize metabolic demands. Consider the following scientifically grounded framework:\n\n- In steady state, the infant’s metabolic heat production, denoted $M$, offsets environmental heat losses through radiation, convection, conduction, and evaporation. This can be represented conceptually as $M$ balancing total heat loss to maintain thermal equilibrium.\n- Oxygen consumption, denoted $VO_{2}$, is proportional to metabolic heat production via a constant caloric equivalent of oxygen, so that proportional changes in $M$ produce proportional changes in $VO_{2}$.\n- Empirically near the thermoneutral range for term neonates, when skin temperature decreases, cold stress elicits a proportional increase in metabolic activity.

A validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It provides all necessary data to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to compute the new rate of oxygen consumption ($VO_2$) for a term neonate after a specified drop in skin temperature.

Let $VO_{2,old}$ be the oxygen consumption before a $1^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ drop and $VO_{2,new}$ be the consumption after. The relationship is:\n$$ VO_{2,new} = VO_{2,old} + 0.10 \\times VO_{2,old} $$\nFactoring out $VO_{2,old}$, we obtain a multiplicative relationship:\n$$ VO_{2,new} = VO_{2,old} \\times (1 + 0.10) = VO_{2,old} \\times 1.10 $$\n\nThe problem specifies a total temperature drop of $\\Delta T_{skin} = 2.0^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and instructs to \"apply this factor multiplicatively for successive $1^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ decrements.\" This implies that the total change is the result of two consecutive $1.0^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ decrements, each applying the multiplicative factor of $1.10$.\n\nLet $VO_{2,0}$ be the initial oxygen consumption, $VO_{2,0} = 6.0 \\, \\mathrm{mL\\,kg^{-1}\\,min^{-1}}$.\nAfter the first $1.0^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ drop, the intermediate oxygen consumption, $VO_{2,1}$, becomes:\n$$ VO_{2,1} = VO_{2,0} \\times 1.10 $$\nAfter the second $1.0^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ drop, the final oxygen consumption, $VO_{2,final}$, is:\n$$ VO_{2,final} = VO_{2,1} \\times 1.10 $$\nSubstituting the expression for $VO_{2,1}$ into the second equation gives the overall model:\n$$ VO_{2,final} = (VO_{2,0} \\times 1.10) \\times 1.10 = VO_{2,0} \\times (1.10)^2 $$\nThis demonstrates exponential growth in response to a linear decrease in temperature, a common form for such physiological models over a limited range.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given initial value of $VO_{2,0} = 6.0$ into the equation:\n$$ VO_{2,final} = 6.0 \\times (1.10)^2 $$\nWe perform the calculation step-by-step:\nFirst, calculate the squared term:\n$$ (1.10)^2 = 1.21 $$\nNext, multiply by the initial oxygen consumption:\n$$ VO_{2,final} = 6.0 \\times 1.21 = 7.26 $$\nThe calculated final oxygen consumption is $7.26 \\, \\mathrm{mL\\,kg^{-1}\\,min^{-1}}$.\n\nThe final step is to adhere to the specified output format, which requires rounding the answer to four significant figures.
