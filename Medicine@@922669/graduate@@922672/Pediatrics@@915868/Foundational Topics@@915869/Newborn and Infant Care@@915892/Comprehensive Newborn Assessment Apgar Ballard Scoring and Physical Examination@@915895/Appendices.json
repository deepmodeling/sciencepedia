The Apgar score is the sum of scores from five domains: Appearance (A), Pulse (P), Grimace (G), Activity (A), and Respiration (R). Each domain is scored from $0$ to $2$.\n\nCalculation of $\\text{Apgar}_{1}$:\n- Appearance: \"trunk pink, distal extremities blue (acrocyanosis)\" corresponds to a score of $1$.\n- Pulse: Heart rate is $92$ beats per minute, which is less than $100$ bpm, corresponding to a score of $1$.\n- Grimace: \"weak grimace to catheter suction\" corresponds to a score of $1$.\n- Activity: \"some flexion of extremities\" corresponds to a score of $1$.\n- Respiration: \"irregular with weak cry\" corresponds to a score of $1$.\nThe total $1$-minute Apgar score is the sum of these individual scores:\n$$\n\\text{Apgar}_{1} = \\text{A} + \\text{P} + \\text{G} + \\text{A} + \\text{R} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\n$$\n\nCalculation of $\\text{Apgar}_{5}$:\n- Appearance: \"acrocyanosis persists, otherwise pink\" corresponds to a score of $1$.\n- Pulse: Heart rate is $160$ beats per minute, which is greater than $100$ bpm, corresponding to a score of $2$.\n- Grimace: \"robust cough and cry to catheter suction\" corresponds to a score of $2$.\n- Activity: \"active movement\" corresponds to a score of $2$.\n- Respiration: \"strong cry\" corresponds to a score of $2$.\nThe total $5$-minute Apgar score is:\n$$\n\\text{Apgar}_{5} = \\text{A} + \\text{P} + \\text{G} + \\text{A} + \\text{R} = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9\n$$\n\nThe second step is to compute the New Ballard Score (NBS) to estimate gestational age. The NBS is the sum of the neuromuscular and physical maturity scores.\n- Neuromuscular maturity score = $3 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 17$.\n- Physical maturity score = $3 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 19$.\nThe total New Ballard Score is:\n$$\n\\text{NBS} = 17 + 19 = 36\n$$\n\nThe third step is to convert the NBS to gestational age (GA) in weeks using the provided linear mapping:\n$$\n\\text{GA} = 0.4 \\times \\text{NBS} + 24\n$$\nSubstituting the value of NBS:\n$$\n\\text{GA} = 0.4 \\times 36 + 24 = 14.4 + 24 = 38.4 \\text{ weeks}\n$$\n\nThe fourth step is to calculate the predictor variables for the logistic model: the Apgar deficits $D_{1}$ and $D_{5}$, and the gestational age deficit $G_{d}$.\n- The $1$-minute deficit $D_{1}$ is:\n$$\nD_{1} = 10 - \\text{Apgar}_{1} = 10 - 5 = 5\n$$\n- The $5$-minute deficit $D_{5}$ is:\n$$\nD_{5} = 10 - \\text{Apgar}_{5} = 10 - 9 = 1\n$$\n- The gestational age deficit $G_{d}$ relative to $40$ weeks is:\n$$\nG_{d} = 40 - \\text{GA} = 40 - 38.4 = 1.6\n$$\n\nThe fifth step is to compute the linear predictor, $\\eta$, using the given formula and coefficients ($\\beta_{0} = -3.5$, $\\beta_{1} = 0.25$, $\\beta_{2} = 0.15$, $\\beta_{3} = 0.10$):\n$$\n\\eta = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} D_{1} + \\beta_{2} D_{5} + \\beta_{3} G_{d}\n$$\nSubstituting the values of the predictors and coefficients:\n$$\n\\eta = -3.5 + (0.25)(5) + (0.15)(1) + (0.10)(1.6)\n$$\n$$\n\\eta = -3.5 + 1.25 + 0.15 + 0.16\n$$\n$$\n\\eta = -3.5 + 1.56 = -1.94\n$$\n\nThe final step is to calculate the probability of NICU admission, $p$, using the logistic function:\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\eta)}\n$$\nSubstituting the value of $\\eta$:\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-(-1.94))} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(1.94)}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\exp(1.94) \\approx 6.959104\n$$\n$$\np \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 6.959104} = \\frac{1}{7.959104} \\approx 0.125643\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $2$, $5$, and $6$. The fifth significant figure is $4$, so we round down.\n$$\np \\approx 0.1256\n$$\nThis is the model-predicted probability of NICU admission for this infant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1256}$$", "id": "5123156"}]}
