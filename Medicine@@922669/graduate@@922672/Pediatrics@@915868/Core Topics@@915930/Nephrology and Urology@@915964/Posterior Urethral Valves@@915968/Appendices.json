It is a well-defined, scientifically grounded problem that can be solved using the provided information and first principles. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis is based on Poiseuille's law, which describes the relationship between volumetric flow rate $Q$, radius $r$, pressure drop $\\Delta P$, fluid viscosity $\\eta$, and tube length $L$.\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nThis relationship can be expressed for the unobstructed state (State $0$) and the obstructed state (State $1$).\n\nFor State $0$:\n$$Q_0 = \\frac{\\pi r_0^4 \\Delta P_0}{8 \\eta L}$$\n\nFor State $1$:\n$$Q_1 = \\frac{\\pi r_1^4 \\Delta P_1}{8 \\eta L}$$\n\nThe problem states that the viscosity $\\eta$ and length $L$ are constant for both states. We can analyze the proportionality of the variables by isolating the constants.\nLet $k = \\frac{\\pi}{8 \\eta L}$. Then the law simplifies to $Q = k r^4 \\Delta P$.\n\n#### Part 1: Derive the ratio $Q_1/Q_0$ for a constant pressure drop $\\Delta P_1 = \\Delta P_0$\n\nWe form the ratio of $Q_1$ to $Q_0$:\n$$ \\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi r_1^4 \\Delta P_1}{8 \\eta L}}{\\frac{\\pi r_0^4 \\Delta P_0}{8 \\eta L}} $$\nThe constants $\\pi$, $8$, $\\eta$, and $L$ cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n$$ \\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\frac{r_1^4 \\Delta P_1}{r_0^4 \\Delta P_0} $$\nThe condition for this part is that the pressure drop remains unchanged, so $\\Delta P_1 = \\Delta P_0$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\frac{r_1^4}{r_0^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_0}\\right)^4 $$\nWe are given that $r_1 = 0.8 \\, r_0$. Substituting this relationship:\n$$ \\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\left(\\frac{0.8 \\, r_0}{r_0}\\right)^4 = (0.8)^4 $$\nTo express this as an exact rational number, we convert the decimal $0.8$ to a fraction: $0.8 = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n$$ \\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = \\frac{4^4}{5^4} = \\frac{256}{625} $$\nThis result shows that an $80\\%$ radius results in a flow rate of only about $41\\%$ of the original, demonstrating the critical dependence of flow on radius.\n\n#### Part 2: Derive the ratio $\\Delta P_1/\\Delta P_0$ required to maintain constant flow $Q_1 = Q_0$\n\nWe begin again with the general ratio:\n$$ \\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\frac{r_1^4 \\Delta P_1}{r_0^4 \\Delta P_0} $$\nThe condition for this part is that the flow rate is maintained, so $Q_1 = Q_0$, which means $\\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = 1$.\n$$ 1 = \\frac{r_1^4 \\Delta P_1}{r_0^4 \\Delta P_0} $$\nWe need to find the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta P_1}{\\Delta P_0}$. We rearrange the equation to solve for this ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta P_1}{\\Delta P_0} = \\frac{r_0^4}{r_1^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_0}{r_1}\\right)^4 $$\nAgain, we substitute the given relationship $r_1 = 0.8 \\, r_0 = \\frac{4}{5} \\, r_0$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta P_1}{\\Delta P_0} = \\left(\\frac{r_0}{\\frac{4}{5} \\, r_0}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{5}}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^4 $$\nCalculating the value of the fraction:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta P_1}{\\Delta P_0} = \\frac{5^4}{4^4} = \\frac{625}{256} $$\nThis result indicates that to overcome the narrowed urethra and maintain the original flow rate, the detrusor muscle must generate a pressure that is $\\frac{625}{256} \\approx 2.44$ times higher than normal. This increased workload on the bladder is a key pathophysiological consequence of obstructive uropathy.\n\nThe two derived ratios are $\\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\frac{256}{625}$ and $\\frac{\\Delta P_1}{\\Delta P_0} = \\frac{625}{256}$.

It presents a standard clinical scenario in pediatric nephrology with all necessary data for calculation and interpretation. The task is to compute the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for a child with a history of posterior urethral valves (PUV) and interpret the result. The problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\nThe calculation of eGFR in children and adolescents relies on empirical formulas that relate serum creatinine (SCr) to height, as height serves as a surrogate for muscle mass and, by extension, the rate of creatinine generation. The problem specifies the use of the \"established pediatric creatinine-height approach appropriate for children aged $1$ to $18$ years with IDMS-standardized creatinine\". This uniquely identifies the updated \"Bedside Schwartz\" equation, published in $2009$. The formula is:\n$$\n\\text{eGFR} = \\frac{k \\times \\text{Height}}{\\text{SCr}}\n$$\nwhere eGFR is expressed in units of $\\text{mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}\\cdot(1.73~\\text{m}^2)^{-1}$, Height is measured in $\\text{cm}$, and SCr is measured in $\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{dL}^{-1}$.

Creatinine, an end-product of muscle metabolism, is produced at a relatively stable rate proportional to muscle mass and is eliminated almost exclusively by glomerular filtration. Consequently, its serum concentration ($SCr$) is inversely proportional to the GFR ($GFR \\propto \\frac{1}{SCr}$). The Schwartz equation is an empirical model of this inverse relationship, using height as a proxy for muscle mass to refine the estimate.\n\nThe prognostic significance in the context of posterior urethral valves (PUV) is profound. PUV is a congenital obstruction of the male urethra that causes elevated pressure within the urinary tract *in utero*. This sustained high pressure impairs normal kidney development, resulting in renal dysplasia, a condition characterized by structurally abnormal parenchyma and a congenitally reduced number of functional nephrons. Valve ablation at $2$ weeks of life relieves the obstruction but cannot reverse the pre-existing dysplastic damage. The eGFR at $18$ months of age is a direct measure of the residual renal function and thus reflects the severity of the initial, irreversible injury. An eGFR of $55.07~\\text{mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}\\cdot(1.73~\\text{m}^2)^{-1}$ indicates the child has a significant deficit in kidney function, retaining only about half of the expected norm for his age. This establishes a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and signifies a high lifetime risk for progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), particularly during the pubertal growth spurt when the functional demand on the kidneys increases.\n\nAccording to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) $2012$ Clinical Practice Guideline, CKD is categorized based on GFR and albuminuria. The GFR categories (G stages) are:\n- G1: $\\ge 90$ (Normal or high)\n- G2: $60-89$ (Mildly decreased)\n- G3a: $45-59$ (Mildly to moderately decreased)\n- G3b: $30-44$ (Moderately to severely decreased)\n- G4: $15-29$ (Severely decreased)\n- G5: $< 15$ (Kidney failure)\n\nThe calculated eGFR of $55.07~\\text{mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}\\cdot(1.73~\\text{m}^2)^{-1}$ places this child in the **G3a** category. Given the history of PUV, a known structural abnormality causing kidney damage, and a GFR below $60~\\text{mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}\\cdot(1.73~\\text{m}^2)^{-1}$ for a duration exceeding $3$ months (a certainty in this congenital condition), the child is formally diagnosed with Stage $3$ CKD.

The detrusor pressure represents the pressure generated by the bladder wall itself, and it is calculated by subtracting the abdominal pressure, $P_{\\text{abd}}$, from the vesical pressure, $P_{\\text{ves}}$:\n$$P_{\\text{det}} = P_{\\text{ves}} - P_{\\text{abd}}$$\nBladder compliance, $C$, is a measure of the bladder's ability to store urine at low pressure. It is defined as the change in bladder volume, $\\Delta V$, divided by the corresponding change in detrusor pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{det}}$, over a specified interval of filling.\n$$C = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta P_{\\text{det}}}$$\nThe problem requires the calculation of compliance over the \"longest contiguous quasi-static filling segment prior to detrusor overactivity.\" The provided data indicates that the study begins at a volume $V = 20\\,\\text{mL}$ and that detrusor overactivity, which marks the end of the quasi-static phase, begins at $V = 160\\,\\text{mL}$. Therefore, the segment for analysis spans from the initial volume measurement up to the last measurement taken before the overactivity event.\n\nThe start point of this segment is the first data point:\n- At $V_1 = 20\\,\\text{mL}$, we have $P_{\\text{ves,1}} = 12\\,\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O}$ and $P_{\\text{abd,1}} = 5\\,\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O}$.\n\nThe end point of the quasi-static segment is the last measurement before the detrusor overactivity at $V = 160\\,\\text{mL}$.
