As part of the evaluation for lower urinary tract symptoms, the caregivers completed a $3$-day bladder diary documenting voided volumes.

The analysis proceeds in three steps: calculation of the expected bladder capacity (EBC), assessment of the functional bladder capacity, and assessment of nocturnal polyuria.\n\n**1. Calculation of Expected Bladder Capacity (EBC)**\n\nThe EBC for a school-age child is estimated using a standard formula. A commonly used formula, endorsed by the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS), is:\n$$\n\\text{EBC (in mL)} = (\\text{Age in years} + 1) \\times 30 \\, \\mathrm{mL}\n$$\nFor the given child of age $6$ years:\n$$\n\\text{EBC} = (6 + 1) \\times 30 \\, \\mathrm{mL} = 7 \\times 30 \\, \\mathrm{mL} = 210 \\, \\mathrm{mL}\n$$\nThe expected bladder capacity for this child is $210 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$.\n\n**2. Assessment of Functional Bladder Capacity**\n\nFunctional bladder capacity is evaluated by comparing the daytime maximum voided volume (MVV) to the EBC. The problem states the daytime MVV is $180 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$.\n\nA normal functional bladder capacity is generally considered to be when the MVV is greater than or equal to $65\\%$ of the EBC. A reduced functional bladder capacity is diagnosed when MVV is less than $65\\%$ of EBC.\n\nLet's calculate the ratio of the child's MVV to their EBC:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{MVV}}{\\text{EBC}} = \\frac{180 \\, \\mathrm{mL}}{210 \\, \\mathrm{mL}} \\approx 0.857\n$$\nExpressed as a percentage, the MVV is approximately $85.7\\%$ of the EBC.\nSince $85.7\\% \\ge 65\\%$, the child's functional bladder capacity is **normal**, not reduced.\n\n**3. Assessment of Nocturnal Polyuria (NP)**\n\nNocturnal polyuria is defined as a nocturnal urine volume (NUV) that exceeds $130\\%$ of the EBC. The NUV is the sum of urine passed during sleep plus the first morning void. The bladder diary provides NUV values for three consecutive nights: $290 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$, $320 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$, and $300 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the threshold for nocturnal polyuria:\n$$\n\\text{NP Threshold} = 130\\% \\times \\text{EBC} = 1.30 \\times 210 \\, \\mathrm{mL} = 273 \\, \\mathrm{mL}\n$$\nNext, we compare the nightly NUV values to this threshold:\n- Night $1$: $290 \\, \\mathrm{mL}  273 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$\n- Night $2$: $320 \\, \\mathrm{mL}  273 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$\n- Night $3$: $300 \\, \\mathrm{mL}  273 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$\n\nSince the NUV on all three nights exceeds the threshold for NP, the child exhibits significant **nocturnal polyuria**. The average NUV is:\n$$\n\\text{Average NUV} = \\frac{290 + 320 + 300}{3} \\, \\mathrm{mL} = \\frac{910}{3} \\, \\mathrm{mL} \\approx 303.3 \\, \\mathrm{mL}\n$$\nThis average value is also well above the $273 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$ threshold.\n\n**4. Synthesis and Therapy Selection**\n\nThe analysis demonstrates that the child has a normal functional bladder capacity and significant nocturnal polyuria. Therefore, the dominant pathophysiologic mechanism is **nocturnal polyuria**.\n\nThe first-line therapy should target the identified dominant mechanism.\n- For nocturnal polyuria, the indicated first-line pharmacotherapy is **desmopressin**, a synthetic analog of the antidiuretic hormone, which acts to reduce nocturnal urine production.\n- Standard conservative measures, such as restricting fluid intake in the evening and ensuring adherence to the treatment plan, are always recommended as part of the initial management.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options.\n\n**A. Dominant nocturnal polyuria; initiate desmopressin with evening fluid restriction and adherence monitoring.**\nThis option correctly identifies the dominant mechanism as nocturnal polyuria based on the bladder diary data ($NUV  130\\%$ of EBC). It also proposes the correct first-line therapy for this mechanism, which is desmopressin, supplemented by standard and appropriate behavioral interventions.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Dominant reduced functional bladder capacity due to detrusor overactivity; initiate an enuresis alarm as monotherapy.**\nThis option is incorrect. The analysis showed a normal functional bladder capacity (MVV was $85.7\\%$ of EBC, not less than $65\\%$). Furthermore, detrusor overactivity is unlikely given the diagnosis of *monosymptomatic* nocturnal enuresis and the explicit absence of daytime symptoms.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Dominant overactive bladder with daytime urgency; initiate antimuscarinic monotherapy (e.g., oxybutynin).**\nThis option is incorrect. The problem statement specifies the child has MNE with \"no daytime lower urinary tract symptoms\". This directly contradicts the assertion of \"overactive bladder with daytime urgency\". Consequently, antimuscarinic therapy is not indicated.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Mixed mechanism with equal contributions from reduced bladder capacity and nocturnal polyuria; initiate combination desmopressin plus enuresis alarm upfront.**\nThis option is incorrect. The analysis did not find a \"reduced bladder capacity\"; rather, the bladder capacity was normal. Therefore, a \"mixed mechanism\" is not present, and the pathophysiology is clearly dominated by nocturnal polyuria. Upfront combination therapy is typically reserved for refractory cases or true mixed-type enuresis, not as a first-line treatment in this scenario.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5217857"}]}
