It provides all necessary information to compute a unique solution using established principles of probability theory. We will now proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nLet $T$ represent the event that the pediatric patient has testicular torsion.\nLet $T^c$ represent the event that the patient does not have testicular torsion.\nLet $POS$ represent the event of a positive color Doppler ultrasound result.\nLet $NEG$ represent the event of a negative color Doppler ultrasound result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we extract the following given probabilities:\n1.  The pretest probability of torsion, which is the prior probability of event $T$:\n    $$P(T) = 0.40$$\n2.

This corresponds to the conditional probability $P(T | NEG)$.\n\nAccording to the fundamental definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$P(T | NEG) = \\frac{P(T \\cap NEG)}{P(NEG)}$$\n\nBayes' theorem provides a way to express this in terms of the quantities we know. The joint probability in the numerator can be re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability as $P(T \\cap NEG) = P(NEG | T) P(T)$. Substituting this into the equation gives Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(T | NEG) = \\frac{P(NEG | T) P(T)}{P(NEG)}$$\n\nTo use this formula, we need to determine the values of the three terms on the right-hand side: $P(NEG | T)$, $P(T)$, and $P(NEG)$.\n\nThe prior probability $P(T)$ is given as $0.40$.\n\nThe term $P(NEG | T)$ is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient has torsion. This is the complement of the sensitivity. Since a test result is either positive or negative, the sum of their probabilities for a given condition is $1$.\n$$P(NEG | T) + P(POS | T) = 1$$\nTherefore, we can calculate $P(NEG | T)$ as:\n$$P(NEG | T) = 1 - P(POS | T) = 1 - 0.88 = 0.12$$\nThis value is also known as the false negative rate.\n\nThe term $P(NEG)$ in the denominator is the total probability of a negative test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, which states that we can find the probability of an event by summing its conditional probabilities over a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events, such as $\\{T, T^c\\}$.\n$$P(NEG) = P(NEG | T) P(T) + P(NEG | T^c) P(T^c)$$\nWe need the probability $P(T^c)$, which is the complement of $P(T)$:\n$$P(T^c) = 1 - P(T) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$$\nNow we can substitute the known and derived values into the formula for $P(NEG)$:\n$$P(NEG) = (0.12)(0.40) + (0.95)(0.60)$$\n$$P(NEG) = 0.048 + 0.570$$\n$$P(NEG) = 0.618$$\n\nNow we have all the necessary components to calculate the final post-test probability, $P(T | NEG)$.

In terms of the survival (salvage) function $S(t)$, it is expressed as:\n$$h(t) = \\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$$\nwhere $f(t)$ is the probability density function for the event (loss of viability). Since $S(t)$ is the probability of surviving past time $t$, $f(t)$ is related to $S(t)$ by $f(t) = -\\frac{dS(t)}{dt}$. Substituting this into the hazard function definition gives:\n$$h(t) = -\\frac{1}{S(t)} \\frac{dS(t)}{dt}$$\nThe problem states that the hazard is constant, $h(t) = k$. Therefore, we have the following first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$k = -\\frac{1}{S(t)} \\frac{dS}{dt}$$\nThis is a separable differential equation, which can be rearranged for integration:\n$$\\frac{dS}{S(t)} = -k \\, dt$$\nWe integrate both sides of the equation. The left side is integrated from $S(0)$ to $S(t')$, and the right side from $t=0$ to $t=t'$:\n$$\\int_{S(0)}^{S(t')} \\frac{1}{S} dS = \\int_{0}^{t'} -k \\, dt$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$[\\ln|S|]_{S(0)}^{S(t')} = [-kt]_{0}^{t'}$$\n$$\\ln(S(t')) - \\ln(S(0)) = -kt' - (-k \\cdot 0)$$\nGiven the initial condition $S(0) = 1$, we have $\\ln(S(0)) = \\ln(1) = 0$. Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\\ln(S(t')) = -kt'$$\nTo find the function $S(t')$, we exponentiate both sides. Replacing the dummy variable $t'$ with $t$ for the general function, we obtain:\n$$S(t) = \\exp(-kt)$$\nThis is the functional form of the salvage probability function under a constant hazard rate $k$, which describes an exponential decay process.

The \"6-hour window\" is a critical benchmark in the clinical management of pediatric testicular torsion, with surgical intervention within this timeframe being paramount for maximizing the chance of salvage. The exponential decay nature of $S(t)$ highlights the urgency: the probability of viability loss is continuous and does not diminish over time. The constant hazard rate $k=0.1 \\, \\text{hour}^{-1}$ implies that for every hour that passes, the testis faces a constant instantaneous risk of transitioning to a non-viable state.
