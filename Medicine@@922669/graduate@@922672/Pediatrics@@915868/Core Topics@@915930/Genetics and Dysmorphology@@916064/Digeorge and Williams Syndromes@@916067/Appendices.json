This is a direct application of Bayes' theorem, which quantitatively describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence.\n\nWe will use the odds formulation of Bayes' theorem, which is particularly well-suited for sequential updates with multiple pieces of evidence. The odds of an event $A$ are defined as $\\mathrm{Odds}(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{1 - P(A)}$. Bayes' theorem in odds form is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Odds}(\\text{Hypothesis} \\mid \\text{Evidence}) = \\mathrm{Odds}(\\text{Hypothesis}) \\times \\mathrm{LR}(\\text{Evidence}) $$\nwhere the likelihood ratio (LR) for positive evidence is $\\mathrm{LR}^+ = \\frac{P(\\text{Evidence} \\mid \\text{Hypothesis})}{P(\\text{Evidence} \\mid \\text{not Hypothesis})}$.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the fetus has a $22q11.2$ deletion.\nLet $D^c$ be the event that the fetus does not have the deletion.\nThe evidence consists of three independent positive findings:\n$1$. $M_1^+$: a right-sided aortic arch.\n$2$. $M_2^+$: an absent fetal thymus.\n$3$. $T^+$: a positive cfDNA test result.\n\nWe want to find $P(D \\mid M_1^+, M_2^+, T^+)$.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Prior Odds**\nThe baseline prevalence provides the prior probability of the disease:\n$$ P(D) = \\frac{1}{4000} $$\nThe prior probability of not having the disease is:\n$$ P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\frac{1}{4000} = \\frac{3999}{4000} $$\nFrom these, we calculate the prior odds of having the disease:\n$$ \\mathrm{Odds}(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} = \\frac{1/4000}{3999/4000} = \\frac{1}{3999} $$\n\n**Step 2: Update with Ultrasound Evidence**\nWe are given the positive likelihood ratios for the two ultrasound markers:\n$$ \\mathrm{LR}_{M_1^+} = \\mathrm{LR}_{\\mathrm{arch}} = 18 $$\n$$ \\mathrm{LR}_{M_2^+} = \\mathrm{LR}_{\\mathrm{thymus}} = 9 $$\nThe problem states that these markers are conditionally independent given the disease status. Therefore, the likelihood ratio for the combined evidence ($M_1^+$ and $M_2^+$) is the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$ \\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{US}} = \\mathrm{LR}(M_1^+ \\text{ and } M_2^+) = \\mathrm{LR}_{M_1^+} \\times \\mathrm{LR}_{M_2^+} = 18 \\times 9 = 162 $$\nWe update the prior odds with this combined likelihood ratio to obtain the intermediate posterior odds after observing the ultrasound findings:\n$$ \\mathrm{Odds}(D \\mid M_1^+, M_2^+) = \\mathrm{Odds}(D) \\times \\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{US}} = \\frac{1}{3999} \\times 162 = \\frac{162}{3999} $$\n\n**Step 3: Update with cfDNA Test Evidence**\nThis intermediate posterior odds now becomes the prior odds for our final update using the cfDNA test result ($T^+$). We first need to calculate the likelihood ratio for a positive cfDNA test, $\\mathrm{LR}_{T^+}$.\nThe test's a priori characteristics are given as sensitivity ($Se$) and specificity ($Sp$):\n$$ Se = P(T^+ \\mid D) = 0.80 $$\n$$ Sp = P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 0.98 $$\nThe likelihood ratio for a positive result is defined as $\\mathrm{LR}_{T^+} = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D)}{P(T^+ \\mid D^c)}$.\nThe numerator is the sensitivity, $Se$. The denominator is the false positive rate, which is $1 - Sp$.\n$$ P(T^+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02 $$\nSo, the likelihood ratio for the positive cfDNA test is:\n$$ \\mathrm{LR}_{T^+} = \\frac{Se}{1 - Sp} = \\frac{0.80}{0.02} = 40 $$\nThe problem states that the cfDNA test result is conditionally independent of the ultrasound findings.

It accurately describes a standard clinical scenario in pediatric genetics, the principles of Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA), and the genetic basis of DiGeorge syndrome. All provided data are realistic and sufficient for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution involves two parts: justifying the diagnosis based on the provided data and calculating the minimal size of the genetic deletion.\n\n**Justification of the Diagnosis**\n\nThe patient, a $6$-month-old infant, presents with a classic triad of clinical features associated with DiGeorge syndrome: a conotruncal cardiac anomaly, velopharyngeal insufficiency, and hypocalcemia. This clinical presentation provides a strong a priori reason to suspect a deletion in the chromosome $22q11.2$ region.\n\nThe Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA) was performed to test this hypothesis. CMA measures the amount of DNA at thousands of specific locations (probes) across the genome. The results are reported as a $\\log_{2}(\\text{ratio})$ of the patient's DNA amount relative to a standard diploid reference.\n- A normal diploid region has two copies of DNA, yielding an expected patient-to-reference ratio of $2/2 = 1$. The corresponding $\\log_{2}(1)$ is $0$.\n- A heterozygous deletion, where one of the two copies of a chromosomal segment is missing, results in a single copy. The expected ratio is $1/2 = 0.5$. The corresponding $\\log_{2}(0.5) = -1$. However, various normalization techniques and platform-specific behaviors in clinical arrays often shift this value. The problem explicitly states that for this platform, a heterozygous deletion manifests as a mean $\\log_{2}(\\text{ratio})$ near $-0.5$, which represents a significant deviation from the normal diploid state.\n\nThe CMA results for this patient identified a contiguous segment of probes on chromosome $22$ with a mean $\\log_{2}(\\text{ratio})$ of $-0.50$. This value is consistent with the platform's signature for a heterozygous deletion, indicating that the patient has only one copy of this specific genomic region instead of the normal two. The flanking regions show mean $\\log_{2}(\\text{ratio})$ values of $0.01$ and $0.02$, which are effectively $0$, confirming they are normal diploid regions.\n\nThe location of this deletion is critical. The deletion is found within the $22q11.2$ chromosomal band. Specifically, it is described as an A–D deletion, meaning it spans the region between Low-Copy Repeat A (LCR-A) and Low-Copy Repeat D (LCR-D). This is the most common (~$85$%) type of deletion responsible for DiGeorge syndrome. The breakpoints are mediated by non-allelic homologous recombination between these LCRs.\n\nTherefore, the CMA finding of a heterozygous deletion in the canonical $22q11.2$ A–D region provides a definitive molecular diagnosis that confirms the clinical suspicion of DiGeorge syndrome.\n\n**Calculation of the Minimal Deleted Interval**\n\nIn CMA, the true genomic breakpoints of a deletion lie in the unprobed region between the last probe showing a normal copy number and the first probe showing a deletion. The minimal size of a deletion is defined by the genomic interval between the first (most proximal) and last (most distal) probes that are determined to be within the deleted segment.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- The proximal edge of the deleted segment is defined by probe $P_{\\text{A, inside}}$, which is the first probe with a $\\log_{2}(\\text{ratio})$ of $-0.50$. Its genomic coordinate is $C_{\\text{start}} = 18,906,432$.\n- The distal edge of the deleted segment is defined by probe $P_{\\text{D, inside}}$, which is the last probe with a $\\log_{2}(\\text{ratio})$ of $-0.50$. Its genomic coordinate is $C_{\\text{end}} = 21,872,991$.\n\nThe minimal length of the deleted interval in base pairs (bp) is the difference between these two coordinates:\n$$ \\text{Length}_{\\text{bp}} = C_{\\text{end}} - C_{\\text{start}} $$\n$$ \\text{Length}_{\\text{bp}} = 21,872,991 - 18,906,432 = 2,966,559 \\, \\text{bp} $$\n\nTo express this length in megabases (Mb), we divide by $10^6$ bp/Mb:\n$$ \\text{Length}_{\\text{Mb}} = \\frac{2,966,559}{10^6} = 2.966559 \\, \\text{Mb} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2$, $9$, $6$, and $6$. The following digit is $5$, which requires rounding up the last significant digit.\n$$ \\text{Length}_{\\text{Mb}} \\approx 2.967 \\, \\text{Mb} $$\nThis size is approximately $3$ Mb, which is the expected size of a typical A–D deletion in the $22q11.2$ region, further substantiating the finding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.967}$$", "id": "5134281"}, {"introduction": "A hallmark of Williams syndrome is supravalvar aortic stenosis (SVAS), a narrowing of the aorta that increases cardiac workload.

It requires the application of fundamental principles of fluid dynamics to a clinically relevant scenario in pediatric cardiology, which is a standard and verifiable approach.\n\nThe solution begins with first principles from fluid dynamics, specifically the Bernoulli equation for an incompressible fluid along a streamline between two points: a proximal point before the stenosis (point $1$) and the point of maximum velocity within the stenosis (point $2$). The general form of the Bernoulli equation is:\n$$ P_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2 + \\rho g h_1 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 + \\rho g h_2 $$\nHere, $P$ is the pressure, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $v$ is the fluid velocity, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height. The fluid in question is blood.\n\nWe apply the simplifying assumptions provided in the problem statement:\n$1$. The flow is inviscid. The Bernoulli equation as stated assumes no energy loss due to viscous forces.\n$2$. The flow is steady. This allows us to apply the time-independent form of the equation.\n$3$. The height difference is negligible. For flow across the supravalvar aorta, the change in vertical height is minimal, so $h_1 \\approx h_2$. This allows us to cancel the potential energy terms, $\\rho g h_1$ and $\\rho g h_2$.\n$4$. The proximal velocity is negligible relative to the jet velocity. In a significant stenosis, the velocity in the wide chamber or vessel proximal to the narrowing ($v_1$) is much smaller than the peak velocity in the stenotic jet ($v_2$). We can therefore approximate $v_1 \\approx 0$.\n\nApplying assumptions $3$ and $4$, the Bernoulli equation simplifies considerably:\n$$ P_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (0)^2 \\approx P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 $$\n$$ P_1 \\approx P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 $$\nThe instantaneous pressure gradient, $\\Delta P$, is the difference in pressure across the stenosis, $\\Delta P = P_1 - P_2$. Rearranging the simplified equation gives the expression for the pressure gradient in terms of the peak jet velocity, denoted as $v = v_2$:\n$$ \\Delta P = P_1 - P_2 \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 $$\nThis expression provides the pressure gradient in SI units (Pascals), given that $\\rho$ is in $\\text{kg/m}^3$ and $v$ is in $\\text{m/s}$.\n\nTo derive the clinically used simplified expression, where $\\Delta P$ is in millimeters of mercury ($\\text{mmHg}$) and $v$ is in $\\text{m/s}$, we must substitute the standard value for the density of blood and apply the appropriate unit conversion. The density of blood, $\\rho$, is approximately $1060 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3$. The conversion factor between Pascals ($\\text{Pa}$) and $\\text{mmHg}$ is approximately $1 \\, \\text{mmHg} \\approx 133.322 \\, \\text{Pa}$.\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$ \\Delta P \\, (\\text{mmHg}) \\approx \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2}{133.322} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} (1060) v^2}{133.322} = \\frac{530}{133.322} v^2 \\approx 3.975 v^2 $$\nFor clinical convenience, this coefficient is rounded to $4$. This rounding also empirically accounts for minor energy losses due to viscous friction and flow acceleration effects not captured by the steady-state Bernoulli equation. Thus, the physically justified and clinically standard simplified expression is:\n$$ \\Delta P \\approx 4v^2 $$\nwhere $\\Delta P$ is the peak instantaneous pressure gradient in $\\text{mmHg}$ and $v$ is the peak jet velocity in $\\text{m/s}$.\n\nNext, we compute the pressure gradient for the given peak jet velocity, $v = 3.5 \\, \\text{m/s}$:\n$$ \\Delta P = 4 \\times (3.5)^2 = 4 \\times 12.25 = 49 \\, \\text{mmHg} $$\nThe calculated peak instantaneous pressure gradient is $49 \\, \\text{mmHg}$.\n\nFinally, we interpret the severity and its clinical relevance. Established pediatric echocardiography guidelines for aortic outflow tract obstruction (including supravalvar aortic stenosis) classify severity based on the peak velocity or the peak instantaneous gradient:\n- Mild stenosis: Peak gradient $< 36 \\, \\text{mmHg}$ (or peak velocity $< 3.0 \\, \\text{m/s}$)\n- Moderate stenosis: Peak gradient $36 - 64 \\, \\text{mmHg}$ (or peak velocity $3.0 - 4.0 \\, \\text{m/s}$)\n- Severe stenosis: Peak gradient $> 64 \\, \\text{mmHg}$ (or peak velocity $> 4.0 \\, \\text{m/s}$)\n\nWith a measured peak velocity of $3.5 \\, \\text{m/s}$ and a calculated peak gradient of $49 \\, \\text{mmHg}$, the child's supravalvar aortic stenosis is classified as **moderate**.\n\nThe relevance of this finding in the context of Williams syndrome due to Elastin ($ELN$) gene deletion is profound. Williams syndrome is caused by a microdeletion on chromosome $7$ that includes the $ELN$ gene. This gene encodes tropoelastin, the monomer of elastin, a critical protein for the elasticity and integrity of arterial walls. Haploinsufficiency of $ELN$ leads to a deficiency of functional elastin, resulting in a systemic arteriopathy characterized by stiff, non-compliant blood vessels. This condition has a predilection for the ascending aorta, leading to narrowing just superior to the aortic valve, which is termed supravalvar aortic stenosis (SVAS). SVAS is the hallmark cardiovascular manifestation of Williams syndrome. The moderate obstruction quantified here imposes an increased afterload on the left ventricle, which must generate higher pressure to eject blood. Chronic pressure overload leads to concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, increased myocardial oxygen demand, and risk of subendocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, and eventual heart failure. Therefore, accurately quantifying the stenosis severity is paramount for risk stratification, guiding medical management, and determining the timing for surgical intervention to relieve the obstruction and prevent irreversible cardiac damage.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{49}$$", "id": "5134266"}]}
