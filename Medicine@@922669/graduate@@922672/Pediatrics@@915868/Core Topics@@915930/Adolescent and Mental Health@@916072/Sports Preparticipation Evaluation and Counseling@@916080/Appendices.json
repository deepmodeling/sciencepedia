This exercise guides you through the essential clinical workflow: from averaging multiple readings to applying age- and height-specific normative data to classify the finding according to established guidelines. By completing this practice, you will solidify the skills needed to move from a raw measurement to a clear, evidence-based plan for clearance and follow-up [@problem_id:5208142].", "problem": "A $14$-year-old male soccer player presents for a sports preparticipation evaluation.

The normative data and classification thresholds provided are consistent with this established medical standard. The scenario is a realistic clinical encounter in pediatric sports medicine. The problem does not violate any scientific principles.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant**: The problem is directly and strictly relevant to the specified topic of *sports preparticipation evaluation and counseling* within *pediatrics*. The tasks are quantitative and clearly defined, requiring calculation and application of given rules, not metaphorical interpretation.\n3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary data: patient demographics, blood pressure readings, normative percentile tables matched to the patient's age and height percentile, and the specific classification guidelines to be used. The instruction to use linear interpolation provides a clear method for calculation. There are no contradictions.\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The anthropometric data, blood pressure readings, and normative values are all within a plausible physiological range for an adolescent male. The conditions described are standard clinical practice.\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The problem is well-posed. The requested calculations (averaging and linear interpolation) will yield a unique solution. The classification task is a direct application of the provided definitions.\n6. **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological**: The problem is not trivial; it requires careful calculation and correct application of clinical guidelines. It is a legitimate test of both computational skill and understanding of pediatric health standards.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The claims and calculations are verifiable according to standard mathematical procedures and established medical guidelines.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe solution is developed by executing the three tasks specified in the problem statement.\n\n**Task 1: Compute the patient’s average SBP and average DBP.**\n\nThe three systolic blood pressure (SBP) readings are $129 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, $127 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, and $128 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. The average SBP, denoted $\\text{SBP}_{\\text{avg}}$, is the arithmetic mean of these values.\n$$ \\text{SBP}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{129 + 127 + 128}{3} = \\frac{384}{3} = 128 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg} $$\nThe three diastolic blood pressure (DBP) readings are $78 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, $76 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, and $77 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. The average DBP, denoted $\\text{DBP}_{\\text{avg}}$, is the arithmetic mean of these values.\n$$ \\text{DBP}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{78 + 76 + 77}{3} = \\frac{231}{3} = 77 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg} $$\nThe patient's average blood pressure is $128/77 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\n**Task 2: Calculate the patient’s SBP percentile.**\n\nThe problem requires the use of linear interpolation to estimate the percentile for the calculated $\\text{SBP}_{\\text{avg}}$ of $128 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. The given normative SBP values surrounding this measurement are the $90$th percentile ($126 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$) and the $95$th percentile ($130 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$).\n\nLet $x$ be the SBP value and $p$ be the corresponding percentile. We have two points $(x_1, p_1)$ and $(x_2, p_2)$, where:\n- $x_1 = 126 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, $p_1 = 90$th percentile (or $0.90$ as a decimal fraction).\n- $x_2 = 130 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, $p_2 = 95$th percentile (or $0.95$ as a decimal fraction).\n\nThe formula for linear interpolation to find the percentile $p$ for a given SBP value $x$ is:\n$$ p(x) = p_1 + (x - x_1) \\frac{p_2 - p_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$\nWe are looking for the percentile corresponding to $x = \\text{SBP}_{\\text{avg}} = 128 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. Substituting the values into the formula:\n$$ p(128) = 0.90 + (128 - 126) \\frac{0.95 - 0.90}{130 - 126} $$\n$$ p(128) = 0.90 + (2) \\frac{0.05}{4} $$\n$$ p(128) = 0.90 + 2 \\times (0.0125) $$\n$$ p(128) = 0.90 + 0.025 $$\n$$ p(128) = 0.925 $$\nThe problem requires the final numeric answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ p(128) = 0.9250 $$\nThe patient's SBP is at the $92.5$th percentile for his age, sex, and height.\n\n**Task 3: Determine sports clearance status and provide recommendations.**\n\nThis task requires classifying the patient's average blood pressure of $128/77 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ using the provided AAP $2017$ absolute thresholds for adolescents aged $\\geq 13$ years.\n- The patient's SBP is $128 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. This value falls within the range $[120, 129] \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n- The patient's DBP is $77 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. This value is less than $80 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\nThe criteria for elevated blood pressure are SBP in $[120, 129] \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ AND DBP $ 80 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. The patient's blood pressure meets both of these conditions. Therefore, his blood pressure is classified as **elevated**.\n\nBased on this classification, for an otherwise healthy athlete with a normal physical exam undergoing a preparticipation evaluation, the recommendations are as follows:\n- **Sports Clearance Status**: The athlete is cleared for full participation in all sports. Elevated blood pressure in an asymptomatic individual without evidence of end-organ damage (which is assumed absent based on the \"otherwise healthy\" description and normal exam) is not a contraindication to sports participation.\n- **Counseling and Follow-up Recommendations**:\n    1.  **Lifestyle Counseling**: The patient and his family should be counseled on lifestyle modifications to help lower blood pressure. This includes adopting the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) eating plan, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, and low in saturated fat and sodium. They should also be counseled on the importance of regular physical activity and maintaining a healthy body weight.\n    2.  **Follow-up**: The patient's blood pressure should be rechecked in $6$ months to monitor the response to lifestyle changes. If the blood pressure remains elevated at the follow-up visit, further evaluation, such as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), should be considered to rule out white-coat hypertension and confirm the diagnosis before considering pharmacologic treatment.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9250}\n$$", "id": "5208142"}, {"introduction": "Screening for rare but catastrophic conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) presents a significant clinical and ethical challenge. This practice demystifies the interpretation of a positive screening test by guiding you through a fundamental Bayesian calculation to determine the true probability of disease after a positive test [@problem_id:5208154]. Mastering this concept is crucial for providing accurate, non-alarmist counseling to athletes and their families, helping them understand the true meaning of a screening result and the rationale for further diagnostic steps.", "problem": "A $16$-year-old male high school soccer player presents for a routine sports preparticipation evaluation. You are counseling about sudden cardiac death risk and screening for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

Round your final numerical result to four significant figures. Express the final probability as a decimal between $0$ and $1$ (do not use a percent sign).", "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded. All necessary information is provided, and the scenario is a standard application of Bayesian probability theory in medical diagnostics. We can therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $D$: The event that the athlete has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).\n- $D^c$: The event that the athlete does not have HCM.\n- $T^+$: The event that the screening electrocardiogram (ECG) is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the screening ECG is negative.\n\nThe information provided in the problem statement can be translated into probabilistic terms as follows:\n- The pretest probability, or population prevalence, of HCM is $P(D) = p = 0.002$.\n- The probability of not having HCM is the complement, $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p$.\n- The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual has the disease: $P(T^+ | D) = Se = 0.85$.\n- The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the individual does not have the disease: $P(T^- | D^c) = Sp = 0.90$.\n\nThe goal is to derive and compute the post-test probability of having the disease given a positive test result, which is denoted as $P(D | T^+)$. This quantity is also known as the positive predictive value (PPV).\n\nThe derivation will start from the fundamental definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nApplying this definition to our problem, we have:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T^+)$, represents the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. This is the probability of a true positive result. We can re-express this using the definition of conditional probability for sensitivity, $P(T^+ | D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(D)}$. Rearranging this gives:\n$$P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | D) \\cdot P(D) = Se \\cdot p$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. A positive result can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios:\n$1$. The person has the disease and tests positive (a true positive).\n$2$. The person does not have the disease and tests positive (a false positive).\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can express $P(T^+)$ as the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:\n$$P(T^+) = P(D \\cap T^+) + P(D^c \\cap T^+)$$\n\nWe have already found the first term, $P(D \\cap T^+) = Se \\cdot p$.\nThe second term, $P(D^c \\cap T^+)$, can be expressed using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(D^c \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | D^c) \\cdot P(D^c)$$\nThe term $P(T^+ | D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test in a disease-free individual, which is the false positive rate. This is the complement of the specificity, $Sp = P(T^- | D^c)$. Since a test result is either positive or negative, $P(T^+ | D^c) + P(T^- | D^c) = 1$. Therefore:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp$$\nAnd we know that $P(D^c) = 1 - p$.\nSubstituting these back, the probability of a false positive is:\n$$P(D^c \\cap T^+) = (1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - p)$$\nNow we can write the full expression for the denominator, $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se \\cdot p) + (1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - p)$$\n\nFinally, substituting the expressions for the numerator and denominator back into the formula for $P(D | T^+)$, we obtain the derived expression, which is an application of Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - p)}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n- $p = 0.002$\n- $Se = 0.85$\n- $Sp = 0.90$\n\nFirst, calculate the value of the numerator:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = Se \\cdot p = 0.85 \\times 0.002 = 0.0017$$\n\nNext, calculate the value of the denominator:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.85 \\times 0.002) + ((1 - 0.90) \\times (1 - 0.002))$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.0017 + (0.10 \\times 0.998)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.0017 + 0.0998$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.1015$$\n\nFinally, we compute the post-test probability:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{0.0017}{0.1015} \\approx 0.01674876847...$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final result to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $6$, $7$, and $4$.

He is asymptomatic (denies chest pain, syncope, dyspnea) with a normal physical exam and no signs of end-organ damage. He wishes to start conditioning.\n*   **Athlete 2:** A $17$-year-old female basketball player who sustained a concussion (mTBI) $10$ days prior. She remains symptomatic, reporting headache, slowed processing with brief exertion, and symptom provocation on vestibulo-ocular testing. She is in school with accommodations and requests to return to noncontact drills.\n*   **Athlete 3:** A $15$-year-old male sprinter ($400$ meters) with sickle cell trait (SCT). He trains in a hot, humid environment. He has no history of exertional events and a normal exam.\n*   **Athlete 4:** A $16$-year-old male wrestler diagnosed with Infectious Mononucleosis (IM) $14$ days ago. He feels less fatigued but has persistent left upper quadrant (LUQ) fullness. An ultrasound confirms splenomegaly (spleen length of $14.5$ cm). He asks about his return to wrestling.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the established criteria:\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly based on established principles of sports medicine and pediatrics. The conditions presented (hypertension, concussion, sickle cell trait, infectious mononucleosis) are common and significant issues in PPE. The referenced guiding bodies (AAP, AHA) and principles (risk stratification, sport classification) are the standard of care. The clinical details are realistic and consistent with medical science.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The task is to select the single best management plan for all four athletes from a set of options, based on applying the specified guidelines. This creates a clear, solvable problem that tests clinical reasoning and knowledge of current standards. A unique, best answer should be identifiable by correctly applying these standards.\n*   **Objective:** The descriptions of each athlete are presented with objective data (BP readings, spleen size, time since injury/diagnosis) and specific symptoms. The language is precise and free of subjective or biased terminology.\n*   **Completeness and Consistency:** Sufficient information is provided for each case to make an evidence-based clearance decision. There are no internal contradictions. For instance, the hypertension is specified as stage $2$ and persistent, the concussion is specified as currently symptomatic, the SCT athlete's sport and environment are high-risk, and the IM is specified with time-since-onset and objective evidence of splenomegaly.\n*   **Realism:** The scenarios are highly realistic representations of dilemmas faced by clinicians performing PPEs for adolescent athletes.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to proceed with a solution.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe solution requires applying current sports medicine guidelines to each athlete's case.\n\n**Analysis of Athlete 1 (Hypertension):**\nAccording to the AAP and AHA guidelines, an adolescent with persistent stage $2$ hypertension (BP $\\ge$$95$th percentile + $12$ mmHg, or $\\ge$$140/90$ mmHg) who has not responded to lifestyle modifications requires further evaluation and initiation of treatment. Pending control of blood pressure, the athlete should be restricted from sports with a high static component (e.g., weightlifting, wrestling, jiu-jitsu). Soccer is primarily a high-dynamic, low-static sport (Class IC), so participation in some conditioning may be allowable. However, unrestricted clearance is inappropriate. The best course of action is to restrict participation in high static activities, initiate medical therapy, and schedule a prompt follow-up (e.g., within $1-4$ weeks) to assess BP control before granting broader clearance.\n\n**Analysis of Athlete 2 (Concussion/mTBI):**\nThe cornerstone of modern concussion management, as outlined by consensus statements and AAP policy, is that an athlete must be completely asymptomatic at rest and with exertion before beginning a graduated return-to-play (RTP) protocol. This athlete is symptomatic $10$ days post-injury, with symptoms provoked by exertion. Therefore, she cannot be cleared for any form of practice, including noncontact drills, as this constitutes exertion. The correct management is to withhold all clearance for athletic activity, support her academic accommodations, and plan for close follow-up. She can only begin the stepwise RTP protocol after she has been symptom-free for a full $24$ hours without the use of symptom-masking medications.\n\n**Analysis of Athlete 3 (Sickle Cell Trait):**\nGuidelines from the National Athletic Trainers' Association (NATA), NCAA, and AAP state that athletes with SCT should not be restricted from sports. The focus of management is on education and risk modification to prevent exertional sickling collapse, a life-threatening emergency. The athlete, coaches, and trainers must be educated on key precautions: ensuring adequate hydration, gradual acclimatization to heat and new conditioning demands, avoiding extreme heat and altitude, and recognizing the signs of an impending sickling event. Therefore, the athlete should be cleared for all sports without restriction, but this clearance must be coupled with mandatory, comprehensive counseling on these precautions.\n\n**Analysis of Athlete 4 (Infectious Mononucleosis):**\nThe primary concern with IM in sports is splenic rupture. The risk is highest in the first $3-4$ weeks of the illness. Guidelines generally recommend no athletic activity for the first $3$ weeks from symptom onset. The athlete is at day $14$ with clinical symptoms (LUQ fullness) and confirmed splenomegaly ($14.5$ cm spleen length). Wrestling is a high-contact/collision sport, posing a maximal risk. He must be strictly withheld from all contact, collision, and strenuous activities. Light, non-contact aerobic activity may be considered after approximately $3$ weeks if symptoms resolve. Return to contact sports should only be permitted after the spleen is no longer enlarged, which is typically at least $4$ weeks from onset and requires clinical re-evaluation. A weekly or bi-weekly follow-up is appropriate to monitor for resolution.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**Option A:**\n*   Athlete $1$: \"Cleared for all sports without restriction\" is incorrect and unsafe for uncontrolled stage $2$ hypertension.\n*   Athlete $2$: \"Cleared for noncontact drills now... full clearance in $1$ week regardless of symptoms\" is incorrect and violates fundamental concussion management principles.\n*   Athlete $3$: \"avoid sprint events\" is an incorrect restriction for SCT.\n*   Athlete $4$: \"Cleared for full contact now\" is extremely dangerous given the recent diagnosis and splenomegaly.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**Option B:**\n*   Athlete $1$: \"Cleared with restriction to dynamic/aerobic training only; no participation in high static/isometric or power sports until blood pressure is controlled; initiate therapy and follow up within $1$ week...\" is a precise and correct application of hypertension guidelines.\n*   Athlete $2$: \"No clearance at this time; follow up in $24$ to $48$ hours; begin graded return-to-play only after $24$ hours of symptom-free status...\" is the correct, standard-of-care management for a symptomatic concussion.\n*   Athlete $3$: \"Cleared for all sports without restriction; counsel on hydration, gradual acclimatization, and heat/altitude precautions...\" is the correct approach for SCT, emphasizing education over restriction.\n*   Athlete $4$: \"Not cleared for contact/collision sports... may begin light, noncontact aerobic activity at approximately $3$ weeks... contact/collision deferred until spleen is no longer enlarged..., with weekly reassessment.\" This is the correct, time-based and symptom-based management for IM and splenomegaly.\n**Verdict:** Correct. This option accurately reflects the appropriate management for all four athletes.\n\n**Option C:**\n*   Athlete $1$: \"No sports participation of any kind until blood pressure normalizes for $3$ months\" is overly restrictive.\n*   Athlete $2$: \"Cleared to return now because $10$ days have elapsed\" is incorrect as return is symptom-based, not time-based.\n*   Athlete $3$: \"Not cleared for high-intensity or competitive sports\" is an incorrect and discriminatory restriction for SCT.\n*   Athlete $4$: \"Exclude from all sports for $6$ months\" is an excessively long and arbitrary restriction.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\n*   Athlete $1$: \"follow-up in $6$ months\" is an unacceptably long interval for uncontrolled stage $2$ hypertension.\n*   Athlete $2$: \"Cleared for noncontact drills now and full competition in $3$ days if symptoms are mild\" is incorrect and dangerous.\n*   Athlete $3$: \"must use supplemental oxygen\" is not a standard recommendation and misses the key educational components.\n*   Athlete $4$: \"Cleared for light contact now because ultrasound rather than palpation was used\" is a dangerous misinterpretation of the data; the ultrasound confirms the risk, it does not mitigate it.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5208192"}]}
