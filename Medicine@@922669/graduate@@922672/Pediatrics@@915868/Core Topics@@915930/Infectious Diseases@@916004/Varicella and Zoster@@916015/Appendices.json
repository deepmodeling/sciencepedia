A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to calculate the posterior probability of a patient having a true VZV infection given a positive test result. This quantity is known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV). We will derive this from first principles using Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n-   $D$: The event that a child has a true VZV infection (the disease is present).\n-   $D^c$: The event that a child does not have a true VZV infection (the disease is absent).\n-   $T$: The event that the PCR test result is positive.\n-   $T^c$: The event that the PCR test result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1.  The pretest probability, or prior probability, of having the disease is $P(D) = 30\\% = 0.30$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present: $P(T|D) = 95\\% = 0.95$.\n3.  The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent: $P(T^c|D^c) = 99\\% = 0.99$.\n\nFrom these given probabilities, we can deduce two additional probabilities required for the calculation:\n-   The prior probability of not having the disease is the complement of having it: $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\n-   The probability of a positive test result given that the disease is absent (the false positive rate) is the complement of the specificity: $P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$.\n\nWe are asked to find the posterior probability $P(D|T)$. According to Bayes' theorem, this is given by:\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, represents the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. It can be calculated by applying the law of total probability, which marginalizes over the state of the disease (present or absent):\n$$\nP(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap D^c)\n$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write:\n$$\nP(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)\n$$\nThe term $P(T|D)P(D)$ is the probability of a true positive, and the term $P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$ is the probability of a false positive.\n\nSubstituting this expanded form of $P(T)$ back into Bayes' theorem, we obtain the complete formula for the Positive Predictive Value:\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)}\n$$\nNow we substitute the numerical values into this derived expression.\n-   $P(D) = 0.30$\n-   $P(D^c) = 0.70$\n-   $P(T|D) = 0.95$\n-   $P(T|D^c) = 0.01$\n\nThe numerator is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive (true positives):\n$$\nP(T|D)P(D) = (0.95) \\times (0.30) = 0.285\n$$\nThe denominator is the total probability of testing positive, which is the sum of the probabilities of true positives and false positives:\n$$\nP(T) = (0.95) \\times (0.30) + (0.01) \\times (0.70)\n$$\n$$\nP(T) = 0.285 + 0.007 = 0.292\n$$\nThe posterior probability $P(D|T)$ is the ratio of these values:\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{0.285}{0.292}\n$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$\nP(D|T) \\approx 0.976027397...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9, 7, 6, 0$. The fifth digit is $2$, so we round down.\n$$\nP(D|T) \\approx 0.9760\n$$\nThus, for a child selected from this cohort, a positive PCR test result increases the probability of a true VZV infection from a prior of $30\\%$ to a posterior probability of approximately $97.60\\%$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9760}\n$$", "id": "5217021"}, {"introduction": "Managing neonatal exposure to varicella requires swift and precise action.

The premises are factually correct within the context of medical practice.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A formal solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the determination of two quantities: the appropriate dose of VariZIG and the earliest feasible administration time.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of VariZIG Dose**\nThe dose of VariZIG is determined by the neonate's weight. The given birth weight is $w = 3.2$ kg. We must locate which weight band this value falls into from the provided dosing schedule.\nThe dosing bands are:\n- Band 1: $0$ kg to $10$ kg\n- Band 2: $10.1$ kg to $20$ kg\n- Band 3: $20.1$ kg to $30$ kg\n- Band 4: $30.1$ kg to $40$ kg\n- Band 5: greater than $40$ kg\n\nThe neonate's weight of $3.2$ kg satisfies the condition $0 \\le 3.2 \\le 10$. Therefore, the neonate falls into the first weight band. The prescribed dose for this band is $125$ International Units (IU).\nDose = $125$ IU.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of Administration Time**\nFirst, we confirm that prophylaxis is indicated. The indication is for maternal varicella onset in the period from $5$ days before delivery to $2$ days after delivery. Maternal rash onset occurred $48$ hours, which is equivalent to $2$ days, prior to delivery. This time point is within the specified interval. Thus, VariZIG administration is clinically indicated.\n\nNext, we determine the earliest possible administration time by considering all logistical constraints. Let $t$ be the administration time in hours postpartum.\n- Constraint 1 (Nursing): The injection can only be given at or after $2$ hours postpartum. This imposes the condition $t \\ge 2$.\n- Constraint 2 (Consent): Parental consent is finalized at $4$ hours postpartum. Administration cannot precede this. This imposes the condition $t \\ge 4$.\n- Constraint 3 (Pharmacy): The product is available at $6$ hours postpartum. Administration cannot occur before the product is ready. This imposes the condition $t \\ge 6$.\n\nFor administration to be feasible, all three conditions must be satisfied simultaneously. We are seeking the earliest time, which is the minimum value of $t$ that satisfies all inequalities:\n$t \\ge 2$\n$t \\ge 4$\n$t \\ge 6$\n\nThe solution to this system of inequalities is $t \\ge \\max(2, 4, 6)$.\nCalculating the maximum: $\\max(2, 4, 6) = 6$.\nTherefore, the earliest logistically feasible time for administration is $t = 6$ hours postpartum.\n\nFinally, we must verify that this time complies with the overall guideline to administer \"as soon as possible within $10$ days ($240$ hours) of exposure.\" An administration time of $6$ hours postpartum is the soonest possible time given the constraints and is well within the $240$-hour maximum window.\n\nThe two required values are a dose of $125$ IU and an administration time of $6$ hours postpartum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 125 & 6 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5217075"}, {"introduction": "The decision to administer a live attenuated vaccine to a child on corticosteroids is a frequent and critical clinical judgment.

It presents a realistic clinical scenario in pediatrics that can be resolved by applying established immunological principles and public health guidelines. All provided information is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and sufficient for deriving a unique, correct course of action.\n\nThe core of this problem is to determine whether the prescribed course of prednisone constitutes an immunosuppressive regimen that would contraindicate the administration of a live attenuated vaccine, and if so, to determine the appropriate waiting period after cessation of the therapy.\n\nFirst, we must quantify the prednisone dose and compare it to the established thresholds for immunosuppression. The patient is a child aged $6$ years, weighing $18\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, and is prescribed systemic prednisone at a dose rate of $2\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$ for a duration of $14$ days.\n\nThe total daily dose of prednisone is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{Daily Dose} = (\\text{Dose Rate}) \\times (\\text{Weight}) $$\n$$ \\text{Daily Dose} = (2\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg/day}) \\times (18\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 36\\,\\mathrm{mg/day} $$\n\nAccording to established public health guidelines, specifically from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a patient is considered to be on an immunosuppressive dose of systemic corticosteroids if they receive prednisone (or its equivalent) at a dose of:\n1. $\\geq 2\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ of body weight per day, or\n2. $\\geq 20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ per day for persons who weigh $> 10\\,\\mathrm{kg}$,\n...for a duration of $\\geq 14$ days.\n\nLet us evaluate the patient's regimen against these criteria:\n1. The dose rate is $2\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$, which meets the criterion of $\\geq 2\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$.\n2. The total daily dose is $36\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$, which exceeds the criterion of $\\geq 20\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$ for a child weighing more than $10\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n3. The duration is $14$ days, which meets the criterion of $\\geq 14$ days.\n\nSince the patient's prednisone regimen meets these criteria, the child is currently immunosuppressed. Systemic glucocorticoids, particularly at this dosage and duration, suppress cell-mediated immunity by inhibiting T-lymphocyte function and proliferation. Live attenuated vaccines, such as the varicella vaccine, contain weakened but viable virus. In an immunocompetent host, the immune system mounts a controlled response that confers immunity. In an immunosuppressed host, the virus can replicate unchecked, potentially causing a severe, disseminated form of the disease it is meant to prevent. Therefore, administering the live varicella vaccine to this child now is contraindicated.\n\nThe second part of the question concerns the necessary waiting period after the prednisone course is completed. The waiting period is required to allow for the recovery of immune function, specifically T-cell competence. For patients who have received short-term ($< 14$ days) high-dose corticosteroids, a waiting period may not be necessary or could be as short as $1-2$ weeks. However, for a prolonged course of $\\geq 14$ days, as in this case, a longer waiting period is mandated. The standard ACIP recommendation is to wait at least $1$ month ($4$ weeks) after discontinuation of high-dose, long-term corticosteroid therapy before administering a live-virus vaccine.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct action is to defer vaccination and reschedule the varicella vaccine for at least $1$ month after the $14$-day course of prednisone is finished.\n\nNow, we will evaluate each option:\n\nA. Administer the varicella vaccine now; no waiting period is needed because $2\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$ is not immunosuppressive in children.\nThis statement is factually incorrect. As demonstrated above, a dose of $2\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$ of prednisone (totaling $36\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$) for a duration of $14$ days is the explicit definition of an immunosuppressive regimen according to standard clinical guidelines. Administering the vaccine now would pose a significant risk to the patient.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nB. Do not vaccinate now; administer the varicella vaccine $1$ week after the prednisone course is completed.\nThis option correctly identifies that vaccination should be delayed. However, the waiting period of $1$ week is insufficient. A waiting period of less than $4$ weeks is generally considered only after short-term ($< 14$-day) steroid therapy. Since this patient's therapy is for a duration of $14$ days, a longer period is required for the immune system to recover adequately.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. Do not vaccinate now; administer the varicella vaccine at least $4$ weeks (i.e., $\\geq 1$ month) after the prednisone course is completed.\nThis option correctly identifies that vaccination should be deferred. It also specifies the correct waiting period of at least $4$ weeks ($1$ month) after the completion of a $\\geq 14$-day course of immunosuppressive steroids. This is the standard of care recommended by major public health bodies to ensure immune reconstitution before administering a live vaccine.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nD. Administer the varicella vaccine now if there is imminent exposure; the benefits outweigh the immunosuppressive risk.\nThis is dangerously incorrect advice. In an immunosuppressed patient with a known, significant exposure to varicella, the appropriate management is post-exposure prophylaxis with Varicella-Zoster Immune Globulin (VARIZIG), which provides passive immunity. Administering a live vaccine under these circumstances would be a significant and avoidable iatrogenic risk, as it could cause vaccine-strain disseminated varicella. The risk far outweighs any potential benefit.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE. Do not vaccinate now; wait $3$ months after the prednisone course to account for prolonged immunosuppression similar to chemotherapy.\nThis option correctly identifies the need to delay vaccination. However, the recommended waiting period of $3$ months is excessive for this specific clinical scenario. A waiting period of $3$ months or longer is typically reserved for recovery from more profoundly immunosuppressive treatments, such as intensive cancer chemotherapy or certain biologic agents. The immune system is expected to recover sufficiently from a $14$-day course of prednisone within $1$ month.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "5217086"}]}
