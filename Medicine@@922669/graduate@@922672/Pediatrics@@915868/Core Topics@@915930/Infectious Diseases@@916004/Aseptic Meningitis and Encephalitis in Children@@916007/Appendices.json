The team estimates the pretest probability of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) encephalitis to be $p$, based on early clinical features and preliminary laboratory data, while a CSF HSV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is pending and will return in approximately $24$ hours. Immediate empiric intravenous acyclovir is considered. Use first principles of expected utility (expected loss minimization) to construct a decision threshold for empiric acyclovir and then determine the optimal action when $P(\\mathrm{HSV}) > 0.05$.\n\nAssume the following, expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as a unified loss metric:\n- Initiating empiric acyclovir imposes a small treatment-related disutility $c_{\\mathrm{drug}} = 0.001$ due to infusion burden and monitoring.\n- Acyclovir carries a probability of nephrotoxicity $p_{\\mathrm{nephro}} = 0.015$, with an associated disutility $c_{\\mathrm{nephro}} = 0.01$ if nephrotoxicity occurs.\n- Deferring acyclovir until CSF HSV PCR results in $24$ hours leads, if HSV encephalitis is truly present, to an incremental disutility $c_{\\mathrm{delay}} = 0.03$ due to increased risk of neurological sequelae attributable to delayed antiviral coverage.\n\nUsing the expected loss principle, derive from first principles the decision threshold probability $p^{*}$ at which the expected loss of empiric treatment equals the expected loss of deferring treatment.

Express the final value of $\\Delta$ as a decimal and round your answer to four significant figures. No units are required for the final reported value of $\\Delta$.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a decision threshold for empiric treatment based on the principle of minimizing expected loss (or disutility), and then using this threshold to evaluate a specific clinical scenario.\n\nFirst, we must formally define the components of this decision problem.\nLet $p$ be the pretest probability that the child has Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) encephalitis. This corresponds to the state of the world where the disease is present, which we denote as $H$. The probability of this state is $P(H) = p$.\nThe alternative state is that the child does not have HSV encephalitis, denoted $\\neg H$. The probability of this state is $P(\\neg H) = 1-p$.\n\nThere are two possible actions:\n1.  **Action A: Treat Empirically.** Initiate immediate intravenous acyclovir.\n2.  **Action B: Defer Treatment.** Wait for the confirmatory CSF HSV PCR result before deciding to treat.\n\nWe will formulate the expected loss, denoted $L$, for each action. The losses are quantified in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).\n\n**Expected Loss of Action A (Treat Empirically)**\nThe loss associated with immediate treatment is composed of two parts as given in the problem statement. First, there is a fixed disutility from the treatment itself, $c_{\\mathrm{drug}} = 0.001$. Second, there is a potential disutility from acyclovir-induced nephrotoxicity. This adverse event occurs with probability $p_{\\mathrm{nephro}} = 0.015$ and carries a disutility of $c_{\\mathrm{nephro}} = 0.01$. The expected loss from nephrotoxicity is the product of its probability and its associated disutility, $p_{\\mathrm{nephro}} \\times c_{\\mathrm{nephro}}$.\nThe total expected loss of treating, $L_{\\mathrm{Treat}}$, is the sum of these components. Importantly, these losses are incurred regardless of whether the patient has HSV encephalitis or not.\n$$L_{\\mathrm{Treat}} = c_{\\mathrm{drug}} + p_{\\mathrm{nephro}} \\times c_{\\mathrm{nephro}}$$\n\n**Expected Loss of Action B (Defer Treatment)**\nThe loss associated with deferring treatment depends on the underlying state of the world.\nIf the child has HSV encephalitis (state $H$, probability $p$), deferring treatment for $24$ hours causes an incremental disutility of $c_{\\mathrm{delay}} = 0.03$ due to the increased risk of neurological sequelae.\nIf the child does not have HSV encephalitis (state $\\neg H$, probability $1-p$), there is no specified disutility from delaying an unnecessary treatment. We therefore assign a loss of $0$ in this case.\nThe total expected loss of deferring, $L_{\\mathrm{Defer}}$, is the sum of the losses in each state, weighted by their respective probabilities:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{Defer}}(p) = P(H) \\times (\\text{Loss if } H) + P(\\neg H) \\times (\\text{Loss if } \\neg H)$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{Defer}}(p) = p \\times c_{\\mathrm{delay}} + (1-p) \\times 0$$\n$$L_{\\mathrm{Defer}}(p) = p \\times c_{\\mathrm{delay}}$$\n\n**Derivation of the Decision Threshold, $p^{*}$**\nThe decision threshold, $p^{*}$, is the probability of disease at which the expected losses of both actions are equal. At this point of indifference, $L_{\\mathrm{Treat}} = L_{\\mathrm{Defer}}(p^{*})$.\n$$c_{\\mathrm{drug}} + p_{\\mathrm{nephro}} \\times c_{\\mathrm{nephro}} = p^{*} \\times c_{\\mathrm{delay}}$$\nSolving for $p^{*}$ gives the threshold probability:\n$$p^{*} = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{drug}} + p_{\\mathrm{nephro}} \\times c_{\\mathrm{nephro}}}{c_{\\mathrm{delay}}}$$\nFor any probability $p > p^{*}$, the expected loss of deferring ($p \\times c_{\\mathrm{delay}}$) will be greater than the expected loss of treating ($p^{*} \\times c_{\\mathrm{delay}}$), making empiric treatment the optimal choice to minimize loss. Conversely, for $p < p^{*}$, deferring treatment is the optimal choice.\n\n**Calculation of the Threshold $p^{*}$**\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression for $p^{*}$:\n- $c_{\\mathrm{drug}} = 0.001$\n- $p_{\\mathrm{nephro}} = 0.015$\n- $c_{\\mathrm{nephro}} = 0.01$\n- $c_{\\mathrm{delay}} = 0.03$\n\n$$p^{*} = \\frac{0.001 + (0.015 \\times 0.01)}{0.03}$$\n$$p^{*} = \\frac{0.001 + 0.00015}{0.03}$$\n$$p^{*} = \\frac{0.00115}{0.03} = \\frac{115 \\times 10^{-5}}{3 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\frac{115}{3} \\times 10^{-3} \\approx 0.038333...$$\n\nThe decision threshold is approximately $0.0383$. This means that if the clinical team's estimated probability of HSV encephalitis is greater than $3.83\\%$, the optimal action is to treat empirically.\n\n**Calculation of $\\Delta$**\nThe problem requires the computation of the quantity $\\Delta = 0.05 - p^{*}$. This value quantifies how far the given clinical probability of interest, $0.05$, is from the decision threshold. A positive value for $\\Delta$ indicates that $0.05$ is above the threshold, confirming that empiric treatment is the favored action.\n$$\\Delta = 0.05 - p^{*}$$\n$$\\Delta = 0.05 - \\frac{0.00115}{0.03}$$\n$$\\Delta = 0.05 - 0.038333...$$\n$$\\Delta = 0.011666...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $1$, $6$, and $6$. The fifth digit is $6$, so we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$\\Delta \\approx 0.01167$$\nSince $\\Delta > 0$, the probability $P(\\mathrm{HSV}) = 0.05$ is greater than the threshold $p^{*}$. Therefore, for any probability $p > 0.05$, it is certain that $p > p^{*}$, and the optimal action is to initiate empiric acyclovir to minimize expected loss.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.01167}$$", "id": "5104970"}]}
