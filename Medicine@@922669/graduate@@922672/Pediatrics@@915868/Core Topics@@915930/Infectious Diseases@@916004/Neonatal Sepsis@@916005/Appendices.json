Early-onset sepsis (EOS), defined as culture-proven sepsis within $72$ hours of life, is monitored.

It presents a standard epidemiological calculation based on realistic data for neonatal sepsis. The provided numbers are consistent ($200 + 800 = 1{,}000$). The definitions and assumptions are explicit and sufficient for a unique solution. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles of mathematics or science. It does not contain any of the invalidating flaws listed in the instructions, such as scientific unsoundness, missing information, or ambiguity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the expected number of cases of early-onset sepsis (EOS) within two disjoint subgroups of a birth cohort and for the entire cohort. The fundamental principle is that the expected value of a sum of independent random variables is the sum of their individual expected values.\n\nLet $N_{total}$ be the total number of live births, with $N_{total} = 1{,}000$. This cohort is partitioned into two disjoint subgroups: term births, with population size $N_T = 800$, and very preterm births, with population size $N_{PT} = 200$.\n\nThe incidence rate, as defined in epidemiology, provides a measure of the probability of a new event occurring in a population-at-risk over a specified time period. The problem states that the incidence rates apply uniformly within each subgroup. This allows us to interpret the given rates as the per-infant probability of developing EOS for an individual in that subgroup.\n\nFirst, we convert the given incidence rates from the colloquial \"per $1{,}000$\" format to a dimensionless probability, $p$.\nFor a term infant, the probability of developing EOS, denoted $p_T$, is derived from the incidence rate $I_T$:\n$$p_T = \\frac{1}{1{,}000} = 0.001$$\nFor a very preterm infant, the probability of developing EOS, denoted $p_{PT}$, is derived from the incidence rate $I_{PT}$:\n$$p_{PT} = \\frac{10}{1{,}000} = 0.01$$\n\nThe number of EOS cases in each subgroup can be modeled as the sum of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli random variables. For each infant, we can define an indicator variable that takes the value $1$ if the infant develops EOS and $0$ otherwise. The expected value of such an indicator variable is equal to the probability of the event, i.e., $p_T$ or $p_{PT}$.\n\nLet $E[\\text{Cases}_T]$ be the expected number of EOS cases among the $N_T$ term infants. By the linearity of expectation, this is the sum of the expected values for each infant in the subgroup:\n$$E[\\text{Cases}_T] = N_T \\times p_T$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E[\\text{Cases}_T] = 800 \\times 0.001 = 0.8$$\n\nSimilarly, let $E[\\text{Cases}_{PT}]$ be the expected number of EOS cases among the $N_{PT}$ very preterm infants.\n$$E[\\text{Cases}_{PT}] = N_{PT} \\times p_{PT}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E[\\text{Cases}_{PT}] = 200 \\times 0.01 = 2.0$$\n\nThe problem also requires the overall expected number of cases in the entire cohort of $1{,}000$ births, $E[\\text{Cases}_{total}]$. Since the term and very preterm groups are disjoint and their union constitutes the entire cohort, the total number of cases is the sum of the cases in each subgroup. Again, by the linearity of expectation, the overall expected number of cases is the sum of the expected numbers of cases from the two subgroups.\n$$E[\\text{Cases}_{total}] = E[\\text{Cases}_T] + E[\\text{Cases}_{PT}]$$\nSubstituting the results calculated above:\n$$E[\\text{Cases}_{total}] = 0.8 + 2.0 = 2.8$$\n\nThe three required values are the expected number of cases:\n1.  Overall: $2.8$\n2.  Within term births: $0.8$\n3.  Within very preterm births: $2.0$\n\nThe final answer will present these three exact numerical values in the specified order.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2.8 & 0.8 & 2.0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5174534"}, {"introduction": "Moving from population averages to individual patient assessment is a critical clinical skill.

Let $\\neg D$ denote the event that the neonate does not have sepsis. The baseline risk is the pretest probability, $\\Pr(D)$.\nGiven:\n$$ \\Pr(D) = \\frac{0.5}{1000} = 0.0005 $$\nThe probability of not having the disease is:\n$$ \\Pr(\\neg D) = 1 - \\Pr(D) = 1 - 0.0005 = 0.9995 $$\n\nThe pretest odds, $O(D)$, are defined as the ratio of the probability of having the disease to the probability of not having it:\n$$ O(D) = \\frac{\\Pr(D)}{\\Pr(\\neg D)} = \\frac{0.0005}{0.9995} $$\n\nLet the three clinical findings be denoted by $F_1$ (maternal fever), $F_2$ (GBS positive without prophylaxis), and $F_3$ (rupture of membranes $>18$ hours). The problem provides their positive likelihood ratios ($\\mathrm{LR}^{+}$):\n$$ \\mathrm{LR}^{+}_1 = 3 $$\n$$ \\mathrm{LR}^{+}_2 = 4 $$\n$$ \\mathrm{LR}^{+}_3 = 2 $$\n\nBayes' theorem in odds form states that the posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio for the observed evidence:\n$$ O(D \\mid \\text{Evidence}) = O(D) \\times \\mathrm{LR}(\\text{Evidence}) $$\nIn this case, the evidence is the conjunction of the three findings, $F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3$. The equation is:\n$$ O(D \\mid F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3) = O(D) \\times \\mathrm{LR}(F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3) $$\n\nThe likelihood ratio for the combined findings is defined as:\n$$ \\mathrm{LR}(F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3) = \\frac{\\Pr(F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3 \\mid D)}{\\Pr(F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3 \\mid \\neg D)} $$\n\nA critical piece of information is that the three factors are conditionally independent given the disease status. This means:\n$$ \\Pr(F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3 \\mid D) = \\Pr(F_1 \\mid D) \\times \\Pr(F_2 \\mid D) \\times \\Pr(F_3 \\mid D) $$\nand\n$$ \\Pr(F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3 \\mid \\neg D) = \\Pr(F_1 \\mid \\neg D) \\times \\Pr(F_2 \\mid \\neg D) \\times \\Pr(F_3 \\mid \\neg D) $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the combined likelihood ratio yields:\n$$ \\mathrm{LR}(F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3) = \\frac{\\Pr(F_1 \\mid D) \\Pr(F_2 \\mid D) \\Pr(F_3 \\mid D)}{\\Pr(F_1 \\mid \\neg D) \\Pr(F_2 \\mid \\neg D) \\Pr(F_3 \\mid \\neg D)} $$\nThis expression can be regrouped as the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$ \\mathrm{LR}(F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3) = \\left(\\frac{\\Pr(F_1 \\mid D)}{\\Pr(F_1 \\mid \\neg D)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Pr(F_2 \\mid D)}{\\Pr(F_2 \\mid \\neg D)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\Pr(F_3 \\mid D)}{\\Pr(F_3 \\mid \\neg D)}\\right) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{LR}(F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3) = \\mathrm{LR}^{+}_1 \\times \\mathrm{LR}^{+}_2 \\times \\mathrm{LR}^{+}_3 $$\nThis completes the required derivation, showing that for conditionally independent findings, the total likelihood ratio is the product of the individual likelihood ratios.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value. The total likelihood ratio, $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{total}}$, is:\n$$ \\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{total}} = 3 \\times 4 \\times 2 = 24 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the posterior odds, which we denote as $O_{\\text{post}}$:\n$$ O_{\\text{post}} = O(D) \\times \\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{0.0005}{0.9995} \\times 24 $$\n$$ O_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{0.012}{0.9995} $$\n\nFinally, we convert the posterior odds back to a probability. The relationship between probability $\\Pr(E)$ and odds $O(E)$ is given by:\n$$ \\Pr(E) = \\frac{O(E)}{1 + O(E)} $$\nLet $\\Pr_{\\text{post}}$ be the posterior probability of sepsis, $\\Pr(D \\mid F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3)$.\n$$ \\Pr_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{O_{\\text{post}}}{1 + O_{\\text{post}}} = \\frac{\\frac{0.012}{0.9995}}{1 + \\frac{0.012}{0.9995}} = \\frac{0.012}{0.9995 + 0.012} = \\frac{0.012}{1.0115} $$\nCalculating this value:\n$$ \\Pr_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.0118635887 $$\n\nThe problem asks for the final risk to be expressed as a rate per $1{,}000$ live births, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{Risk per } 1000 = \\Pr_{\\text{post}} \\times 1000 \\approx 0.0118635887 \\times 1000 = 11.8635887 $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $11.86$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{11.86}\n$$", "id": "5174543"}, {"introduction": "Once the decision to treat sepsis is made, precision in dosing is paramount to ensure both efficacy and safety.
