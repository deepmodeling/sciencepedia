No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is to determine the posterior probability of a child having Acute Otitis Media (AOM) given the observation of a bulging tympanic membrane (BTM), based on provided epidemiological data. This is a classic application of Bayes' theorem. We begin by formally defining the events and probabilities.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that a randomly selected child from the specified cohort has Acute Otitis Media.\nLet $B$ be the event that the child presents with a bulging tympanic membrane.\nThe complements of these events are $A^c$ (the child does not have AOM) and $B^c$ (the child does not have a bulging tympanic membrane).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1.  The prior probability (prevalence) of AOM: $P(A) = 0.50$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the BTM sign for AOM. This is the probability of observing the sign given the disease is present: $P(B|A) = 0.85$.\n3.  The specificity of the BTM sign. This is the probability of not observing the sign given the disease is absent: $P(B^c|A^c) = 0.90$.\n\nOur objective is to calculate the posterior probability, $P(A|B)$, which is the probability of the child having AOM given that a bulging tympanic membrane is observed.\n\nWe employ Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} $$\n\nThe numerator is composed of terms that are directly provided: $P(B|A) = 0.85$ and $P(A) = 0.50$.\nThe denominator, $P(B)$, is the total probability of observing a bulging tympanic membrane in this cohort. This can be found using the law of total probability, by conditioning on the presence or absence of AOM:\n$$ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) $$\n\nTo evaluate this expression for $P(B)$, we first need to determine the values of $P(A^c)$ and $P(B|A^c)$.\n\nThe probability of not having AOM, $P(A^c)$, is the complement of the probability of having AOM:\n$$ P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.50 = 0.50 $$\n\nThe probability $P(B|A^c)$ is the probability of observing a BTM in a child who does not have AOM. This is also known as the false positive rate. It can be derived from the specificity, $P(B^c|A^c)$. For the group of children without AOM, the events of having a BTM ($B$) and not having a BTM ($B^c$) are complementary. Thus:\n$$ P(B|A^c) = 1 - P(B^c|A^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 $$\n\nNow, we can substitute the known values into the formula for the total probability $P(B)$:\n$$ P(B) = (P(B|A) \\times P(A)) + (P(B|A^c) \\times P(A^c)) $$\n$$ P(B) = (0.85 \\times 0.50) + (0.10 \\times 0.50) $$\n$$ P(B) = 0.425 + 0.050 $$\n$$ P(B) = 0.475 $$\n\nHaving calculated the total probability of observing a bulging tympanic membrane, $P(B)$, we can now complete the calculation for the posterior probability $P(A|B)$ using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} $$\n$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{0.85 \\times 0.50}{0.475} = \\frac{0.425}{0.475} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be an exact fraction. We convert the decimal values into a ratio of integers:\n$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{0.425}{0.475} = \\frac{425}{475} $$\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor of $425$ and $475$. Both are divisible by $25$:\n$$ 425 = 17 \\times 25 $$\n$$ 475 = 19 \\times 25 $$\n\nTherefore, the simplified fraction is:\n$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{17 \\times 25}{19 \\times 25} = \\frac{17}{19} $$\n\nThus, the posterior probability that a child has AOM given the presence of a bulging tympanic membrane is $\\frac{17}{19}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{17}{19}}$$", "id": "5095874"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis of AOM is likely, the immediate management priority is to alleviate the child's distress.

It is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution.\n\nThe justification for prioritizing pain control over immediate antimicrobial therapy in uncomplicated Acute Otitis Media (AOM) is built upon a synthesis of pathophysiology, pharmacology, and evidence-based clinical principles.\n\nFirst, we must consider the pathophysiology of pain in AOM. AOM is characterized by inflammation of the middle ear, often following a viral upper respiratory infection that leads to Eustachian tube dysfunction. This inflammation results in the accumulation of fluid and an increase in pressure within the middle ear cleft, causing the tympanic membrane to bulge. The inflammatory cascade is initiated, leading to the release of various chemical mediators, including prostaglandins (especially $PGE_2$), bradykinin, and cytokines. These mediators have two primary effects relevant to pain: they directly activate nociceptors (pain-sensitive nerve endings) located in the middle ear mucosa and tympanic membrane, and they sensitize these nocicepetors, lowering their threshold for activation by mechanical stimuli (i.e., pressure). This activation generates afferent signals that travel primarily via the glossopharyngeal nerve ($CN\\,IX$) to the central nervous system, where they are perceived as intense pain (otalgia). The patient's fever is also driven by these systemic inflammatory mediators, particularly prostaglandins acting on the hypothalamus.\n\nSecond, we analyze the temporal relationship between the mechanisms of action for analgesics versus antimicrobials.\nAnalgesics such as acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen directly address the symptomatic manifestations of the inflammatory process. Ibuprofen acts by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzymes ($COX-1$ and $COX-2$), thereby blocking the synthesis of prostaglandins. By reducing prostaglandin levels, ibuprofen directly diminishes nociceptor sensitization and activation, leading to pain relief. It also exerts an antipyretic effect by reducing prostaglandin levels in the central nervous system. Acetaminophen's mechanism is not fully elucidated but is understood to involve central analgesic effects, possibly through modulation of the serotonergic and cannabinoid systems, and weak peripheral $COX$ enzyme inhibition. The crucial point is that both classes of analgesics have a relatively rapid onset of action, typically providing tangible relief from pain and fever within $30$ to $60$ minutes. This directly and quickly addresses the patient's primary source of distress.\n\nIn contrast, antimicrobial agents target the underlying bacterial cause, if one is present. The therapeutic effect of an antibiotic requires several steps: absorption, distribution to the site of infection (the middle ear fluid), reaching a concentration above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the specific pathogen, and finally, exerting its bactericidal or bacteriostatic effect. This entire process takes a significant amount of time. Clinical improvement attributable to antibiotics in AOM is typically not observed for at least $24$ to $48$ hours. Therefore, initiating antibiotics provides no immediate relief for the patient's most acute symptom: pain.\n\nThird, we apply a risk-benefit framework guided by evidence-based medicine and the principles of antimicrobial stewardship. A substantial percentage of AOM cases are caused by viruses, against which antibiotics are ineffective. Furthermore, a significant number of bacterial AOM cases resolve spontaneously without antimicrobial treatment. Evidence from numerous clinical trials has shown that for uncomplicated AOM in children over a certain age (e.g., $\\geq 2$ years), the strategy of \"watchful waiting\" or observation for $48$ to $72$ hours is safe and effective. This strategy involves providing robust analgesia immediately and deferring the decision to use antibiotics.\nThe benefits of prioritizing analgesia are clear: rapid relief of suffering.\nThe risks of immediate, unnecessary antimicrobial therapy are significant:\n1.  Individual patient risk: Adverse drug reactions, including gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea, vomiting), rashes, and potentially severe allergic reactions.\n2.  Public health risk: The overuse of antibiotics is a primary driver of antimicrobial resistance, which threatens our ability to treat serious bacterial infections globally.\n\nIn conclusion, the justification is threefold:\n1.  Pathophysiologically, pain is the immediate and dominant symptom driven by inflammatory mediators.\n2.  Pharmacologically, analgesics offer rapid relief by targeting these mediators, whereas antibiotics act slowly and only on a subset of cases.\n3.  From an evidence-based, risk-benefit perspective, prioritizing pain control maximizes immediate patient benefit while minimizing individual and public health risks associated with unnecessary antibiotic use, in line with modern principles of antimicrobial stewardship.\n\nFor the calculation part, we are given the child's mass, $m = 14\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\nThe standard single dose for acetaminophen is given as $15\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$. The total dose, $D_{acetaminophen}$, is:\n$$D_{acetaminophen} = 14\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 15\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg}} = 210\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe standard single dose for ibuprofen is given as $10\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$. The total dose, $D_{ibuprofen}$, is:\n$$D_{ibuprofen} = 14\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 10\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg}} = 140\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe problem requires the answers to be rounded to three significant figures.

The calculation will proceed in three steps: first, determining the total daily mass of the drug; second, determining the mass per individual dose; and third, converting this mass into a volume using the provided concentration of the suspension.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the information provided in the problem statement:\n- The child's body mass is $m = 16\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- The prescribed dosing rate is $R = 90\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{day}}$.\n- The dosing frequency is every $12$ hours (q12h), which corresponds to a number of doses per day, $n = \\frac{24\\,\\text{hours}}{12\\,\\text{hours}} = 2$.\n- The concentration of the amoxicillin oral suspension is $C_{susp} = \\frac{400\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{5\\,\\mathrm{mL}}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total mass of amoxicillin to be administered per day, denoted as $M_{daily}$.
