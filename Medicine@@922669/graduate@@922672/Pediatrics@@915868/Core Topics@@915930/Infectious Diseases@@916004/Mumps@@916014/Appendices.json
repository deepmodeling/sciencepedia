In this case, the daily dosage constraint is more restrictive than the interval constraint.\n    $$N_{A, \\text{max}} = \\min(N_{A, \\text{interval}}, N_{A, \\text{daily dose}}) = \\min(6, 5) = 5$$\n\nThe four requested values are $V_I = 11.4$, $V_A = 10.6$, $N_{I, \\text{max}} = 4$, and $N_{A, \\text{max}} = 5$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n11.4  10.6  4  5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5172290"}, {"introduction": "A key challenge in managing mumps is the timely diagnosis of its complications, such as pancreatitis, which can present with symptoms that overlap with parotitis.

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is normal. Serum creatinine is normal.\n-   Diagnostic Goal: Differentiate whether the amylase elevation arises predominantly from salivary glands or pancreas.\n-   Methodological Constraints: The strategy must use isoenzyme analysis and timing of sample collection.\n-   Required Fundamental Bases:\n    1.  Definition of isoenzymes (enzymes catalyzing the same reaction, encoded by different genes, tissue-specific distribution).\n    2.  Principle of first-order elimination with a characteristic half-life, $t_{1/2}$.\n    3.  Pathophysiology of mumps parotitis (paramyxovirus-induced salivary acinar injury releasing salivary amylase).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in established principles of medicine, biochemistry, and physiology. The clinical presentation is classic for mumps with a differential diagnosis of pancreatitis. The use of amylase, its isoenzymes ($\\text{AMY1}$/salivary and $\\text{AMY2}$/pancreatic), and their clearance kinetics is a standard topic in clinical chemistry.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for the best strategy among a set of choices to solve a specific diagnostic problem, given a constrained set of allowed methodologies and fundamental principles. A logical solution can be derived.\n-   **Objective:** The language is clinical and precise, free from subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n-   **Flaw Check:** The problem statement does not violate any criteria for validity. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, and well-structured.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed to derive the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Optimal Strategy**\n\nThe core of the problem is to resolve the ambiguity of an elevated total serum amylase ($600$ units/liter) in a patient with clinical signs suggesting both salivary (parotitis) and pancreatic (epigastric pain) involvement. The solution must be constructed from the given principles.\n\n1.  **Principle of Isoenzymes:** The total amylase activity in serum is the sum of activities of its isoenzymes. The two major contributors are salivary amylase ($\\text{AMY1}$, S-type) and pancreatic amylase ($\\text{AMY2}$, P-type). Because they have tissue-specific origins, quantifying their relative or absolute amounts directly addresses the question of the source of the hyperamylasemia. Therefore, any valid strategy must include the measurement of $\\text{AMY1}$ and $\\text{AMY2}$ fractions.\n\n2.  **Principle of Pathophysiology and Timing:**\n    -   The patient has had parotid swelling for $48$ hours. This suggests that salivary gland injury has been releasing $\\text{AMY1}$ into the circulation for this duration.\n    -   The patient has had abdominal symptoms, suggestive of pancreatitis, for only $12$ hours. If pancreatitis is present, the release of $\\text{AMY2}$ is a more recent and acute event.\n\n3.  **Principle of First-Order Elimination (Kinetics):** Serum enzymes are cleared from circulation following first-order kinetics. The concentration $C(t)$ of an enzyme at time $t$ after its release has ceased is described by $C(t) = C_0 e^{-kt}$, where $k$ is the elimination rate constant. The half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is related to $k$ by $t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/k$. The stated typical half-life for amylase is $t_{1/2} \\approx 10$–$12$ hours.\n    -   An acute release, as expected in pancreatitis, will lead to a sharp rise in the specific enzyme ($\\text{AMY2}$), peaking typically within $24$ hours of onset, followed by a predictable decline. After $n$ half-lives, the concentration will have dropped to $(1/2)^n$ of its peak value.\n    -   A more subacute or ongoing process, like parotitis, might lead to a more sustained elevation of its corresponding enzyme ($\\text{AMY1}$), as release may continue over several days.\n\n**Synthesis of an Optimal Strategy:**\nAn optimal strategy must leverage both isoenzyme specificity and kinetic behavior.\n-   **Measurement:** It is crucial to measure serum $\\text{AMY1}$ and $\\text{AMY2}$ fractions.\n-   **Timing:** To capture the kinetic profile, at least two measurements are necessary.\n    -   The first sample should be taken as early as possible after the onset of abdominal symptoms (the problem notes they began $12$ hours ago) to capture the peak or near-peak concentration of $\\text{AMY2}$ if pancreatitis is the cause.\n    -   The second sample should be taken sufficiently later to demonstrate the expected decay based on a half-life of $t_{1/2} \\approx 10$–$12$ hours. A time point of $72$ hours after the *initial onset* of abdominal pain (which is $60$ hours after the first sample) corresponds to approximately $5$–$6$ half-lives. This is an excellent interval to confirm a rapid decline, as the $\\text{AMY2}$ level would be expected to fall to $(1/2)^5 \\approx 3\\%$ to $(1/2)^6 \\approx 1.5\\%$ of its peak level.\n-   **Interpretation:**\n    -   **Pancreatitis:** A high initial fraction of $\\text{AMY2}$ (typically, a fraction $\\geq 0.4$, with some labs using higher cutoffs) followed by a sharp decrease in the second sample consistent with the known $t_{1/2}$.\n    -   **Parotitis:** A sustained high fraction of $\\text{AMY1}$ across both samples, without a significant $\\text{AMY2}$ component or its characteristic rapid decline.\n\nThis derived strategy provides the framework against which the options can be evaluated.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Order serum isoamylase quantification separating salivary amylase ($\\text{AMY1}$) and pancreatic amylase ($\\text{AMY2}$) within $12$ hours of abdominal pain onset and repeat at $72$ hours; interpret early predominance of $\\text{AMY2}$ (for example, $\\text{AMY2} \\geq 70\\%$ of total) with subsequent decline toward baseline consistent with an enzyme half-life $t_{1/2} \\approx 10$–$12$ hours as pancreatic-source hyperamylasemia, whereas sustained predominance of $\\text{AMY1}$ tracking with the course of parotid swelling indicates salivary-source hyperamylasemia.**\n-   This option proposes measuring the correct analytes ($\\text{AMY1}$ and $\\text{AMY2}$), fulfilling the \"isoenzyme analysis\" requirement.\n-   It proposes an excellent timing strategy: an early sample (at presentation, which is $12$ hours into abdominal pain) and a late sample ($72$ hours after onset) that allows for assessment of the kinetic decay profile over multiple half-lives.\n-   The interpretation logic is sound and directly applies the principles of first-order elimination and tissue-specific enzyme release. The example threshold ($\\text{AMY2} \\geq 70\\%$) is a clinically relevant rule of thumb, representing predominance.\n-   This strategy perfectly aligns with the derived optimal strategy.\n-   **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Rely on total serum amylase alone at presentation and repeat at $7$ days; if the value remains elevated, infer a salivary source, and if it normalizes rapidly, infer a pancreatic source.**\n-   This option fails the first requirement by using only total serum amylase, which is non-specific and the reason for the diagnostic challenge.\n-   The timing is poor. A repeat at $7$ days ($168$ hours) is far too late to characterize the decay of an enzyme with a $t_{1/2}$ of $10$–$12$ hours. By this time, amylase from an acute pancreatitis event would have long since normalized, providing no information about its initial peak or decay rate.\n-   The interpretive logic is weak and potentially misleading.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Measure urinary amylase once at $48$ hours; if urinary amylase remains elevated while serum amylase declines, attribute the source to pancreas; if urinary amylase is normal, attribute the source to salivary glands.**\n-   This option fails to use serum isoenzyme analysis as required. It proposes a single measurement of urinary amylase.\n-   The proposed interpretive logic is not a standard or reliable physiological principle for differentiating pancreatitis from parotitis. The renal handling of amylase does not create such a clear-cut diagnostic distinction in this context.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Order serum lipase alone at $24$ hours as the definitive discriminator; if lipase is elevated, infer pancreas; if lipase is normal, infer salivary glands.**\n-   While measuring serum lipase is an excellent and often preferred real-world strategy for diagnosing pancreatitis due to its higher specificity, it violates the explicit constraints of the problem statement, which mandates a strategy based on \"isoenzyme analysis [of amylase] and timing\". This option proposes a different test entirely. A strict adherence to the problem's premises is required.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Calculate the amylase–creatinine clearance ratio (ACCR) at day $5$; if the ratio is low (for example, $\\leq 1\\%$), infer a salivary source; if the ratio is high (for example, $\\geq 5\\%$), infer a pancreatic source.**\n-   This option proposes using the ACCR, an outdated test with known poor specificity. More importantly, it does not use isoenzyme fractionation.\n-   The timing at day $5$ is far too late. By this point, the serum amylase from acute pancreatitis would likely have returned to normal, making the ratio calculation uninformative or meaningless for diagnosing the acute event.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on rigorous analysis, Option A is the only one that correctly and fully implements the specified fundamental principles of isoenzyme analysis and kinetic-based timed sampling to solve the stated diagnostic problem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5172226"}, {"introduction": "In an era of widespread vaccination, the pre-test probability of mumps in a child presenting with parotitis is very low.

Since a test result can only be positive or negative, for a subject without mumps, the sum of the probabilities of these two outcomes must be $1$:\n$$P(T^+ | M^c) + P(T^- | M^c) = 1$$\nTherefore, the false positive rate is:\n$$P(T^+ | M^c) = 1 - P(T^- | M^c) = 1 - \\text{specificity}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute all these parts back into the expression for $P(M | T^+)$.\nThe derived expression for the probability that the child has mumps given a positive test, in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and pre-test probability, is:\n$$P(M | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | M) P(M)}{P(T^+ | M) P(M) + (1 - P(T^- | M^c)) (1 - P(M))}$$\nLet's denote the pre-test probability $P(M)$ as $p$. The expression is:\n$$P(M | T^+) = \\frac{(\\text{sensitivity}) \\cdot p}{(\\text{sensitivity}) \\cdot p + (1 - \\text{specificity}) \\cdot (1 - p)}$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given values:\n$p = P(M) = 0.005$\n$\\text{sensitivity} = P(T^+ | M) = 0.75$\n$\\text{specificity} = P(T^- | M^c) = 0.98$\n\nFirst, we calculate the complementary probabilities:\n$1 - p = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995$\n$1 - \\text{specificity} = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator.\nNumerator (probability of a true positive):\n$$P(T^+ | M) P(M) = 0.75 \\times 0.005 = 0.00375$$\n\nDenominator, Term 1 (probability of a true positive):\n$$P(T^+ | M) P(M) = 0.00375$$\nDenominator, Term 2 (probability of a false positive):\n$$P(T^+ | M^c) P(M^c) = (1 - \\text{specificity}) \\cdot (1 - p) = 0.02 \\times 0.995 = 0.0199$$\n\nThe total probability of a positive test is the sum of these two terms:\n$$P(T^+) = 0.00375 + 0.0199 = 0.02365$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the posterior probability $P(M | T^+)$:\n$$P(M | T^+) = \\frac{0.00375}{0.02365} \\approx 0.15856236786...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first non-zero digit is in the tenths place, so we need to round to the ten-thousandths place.\n$$P(M | T^+) \\approx 0.1586$$\nThus, given a positive IgM test in this clinical scenario, the probability that the child actually has mumps is approximately $15.86\\%$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1586}$$", "id": "5172268"}]}
