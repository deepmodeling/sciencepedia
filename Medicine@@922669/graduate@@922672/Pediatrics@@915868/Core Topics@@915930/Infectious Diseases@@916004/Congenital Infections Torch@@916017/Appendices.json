The infant is initiated on aqueous penicillin G for presumed congenital syphilis. In neonatal pharmacotherapy, dosing is scaled to body mass and delivered at fixed intervals; in this case, the regimen is aqueous penicillin G at $50{,}000$ units per kilogram Intravenous (IV) every $12$ hours for the first $7$ days of life, followed by every $8$ hours thereafter to complete a $10$-day total course.

The quantitative part is a well-defined calculation based on a piecewise dosing schedule. The qualitative part requires an explanation based on established principles of perinatal medicine and infectious disease management. The problem is scientifically grounded and well-posed.\n\nFirst, we will calculate the total cumulative amount of penicillin G administered to the neonate. The calculation is based on the dosing regimen provided, which is divided into two distinct phases.\n\nLet $m$ be the constant dosing weight of the neonate, given as $m = 3.2 \\, \\text{kg}$.\nLet $D_{\\text{base}}$ be the dose per unit mass, given as $D_{\\text{base}} = 50,000 \\, \\text{units/kg}$.\n\nThe single dose administered at each instance, $D_{\\text{admin}}$, is the product of the base dose and the neonate's mass:\n$$D_{\\text{admin}} = D_{\\text{base}} \\times m = 50,000 \\, \\frac{\\text{units}}{\\text{kg}} \\times 3.2 \\, \\text{kg} = 160,000 \\, \\text{units}$$\nThis dose amount is constant for every administration throughout the $10$-day course.\n\nThe total course is divided into two phases with different dosing frequencies.\n\nPhase 1: For the first $7$ days of life.\nThe duration of this phase is $T_1 = 7 \\, \\text{days}$. The dosing interval is $\\Delta t_1 = 12 \\, \\text{hours}$.\nA day consists of $24$ hours. The number of doses per day in this phase is $\\frac{24 \\, \\text{h}}{12 \\, \\text{h}} = 2$.\nThe total number of doses in Phase 1, $N_1$, is the product of the number of days and the doses per day:\n$$N_1 = 7 \\, \\text{days} \\times 2 \\, \\frac{\\text{doses}}{\\text{day}} = 14 \\, \\text{doses}$$\nAlternatively, we can work in hours. The duration is $T_1 = 7 \\times 24 = 168$ hours. Since a dose is given every $12$ hours starting from $t=0$, the number of doses is the number of intervals of length $12$ hours in a $168$-hour period, which is $N_1 = \\frac{168 \\, \\text{h}}{12 \\, \\text{h}} = 14$.\n\nPhase 2: From the end of Phase 1 until the completion of the $10$-day course.\nThe total course duration is $T_{\\text{total}} = 10 \\, \\text{days}$. Phase 1 covers the first $7$ days. Therefore, Phase 2 covers the remaining days:\n$$T_2 = T_{\\text{total}} - T_1 = 10 \\, \\text{days} - 7 \\, \\text{days} = 3 \\, \\text{days}$$\n(These are days $8$, $9$, and $10$).\nThe dosing interval in Phase 2 is $\\Delta t_2 = 8 \\, \\text{hours}$.\nThe number of doses per day in this phase is $\\frac{24 \\, \\text{h}}{8 \\, \\text{h}} = 3$.\nThe total number of doses in Phase 2, $N_2$, is:\n$$N_2 = 3 \\, \\text{days} \\times 3 \\, \\frac{\\text{doses}}{\\text{day}} = 9 \\, \\text{doses}$$\nAlternatively, in hours, the duration is $T_2 = 3 \\times 24 = 72$ hours. The number of doses is $N_2 = \\frac{72 \\, \\text{h}}{8 \\, \\text{h}} = 9$.\n\nThe total number of doses administered over the entire $10$-day course, $N_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the doses from both phases:\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = N_1 + N_2 = 14 + 9 = 23 \\, \\text{doses}$$\n\nThe total cumulative amount of penicillin G, $U_{\\text{total}}$, is the total number of doses multiplied by the amount per dose:\n$$U_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{total}} \\times D_{\\text{admin}} = 23 \\times 160,000 \\, \\text{units} = 3,680,000 \\, \\text{units}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $3,680,000$ can be written in scientific notation as $3.680 \\times 10^6$, where the trailing zero is significant. Thus, the value is already at the required precision.\n\nSeparately, the problem asks for a justification for penicillin desensitization in penicillin-allergic pregnant patients with syphilis.\n\nThe justification is grounded in the foundational principle of preventing vertical transmission of *Treponema pallidum*, the causative agent of syphilis.\n1.  **Unique Efficacy of Penicillin:** Penicillin is the only antimicrobial agent with proven efficacy for treating syphilis in pregnancy and, critically, for treating the infected fetus in utero. It readily crosses the placenta to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the fetal circulation and tissues.\n2.  **Inadequacy of Alternatives:** Other antibiotics are not recommended. Tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline) are contraindicated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy due to adverse effects on fetal bone and tooth development. Other agents like azaithromycin have documented resistance, and while ceftriaxone can be used in some non-pregnant scenarios, its efficacy in preventing congenital syphilis has not been reliably established. Therefore, treatment of the mother with a non-penicillin regimen does not guarantee treatment of the fetus.\n3.  **High Risk of Untreated Syphilis:** Untreated maternal syphilis leads to severe adverse pregnancy outcomes. There is a high risk of stillbirth, neonatal death, and preterm delivery. Surviving infants are at high risk for congenital syphilis, a devastating multisystem disease that can cause severe, lifelong morbidity or early death if not treated.\n4.  **Risk-Benefit Analysis:** The profound and severe risks to the fetus from untreated or inadequately treated maternal syphilis far outweigh the risks associated with penicillin desensitization. Desensitization is a standardized procedure performed in a controlled inpatient setting where potential allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, can be promptly managed.\n\nTherefore, for a pregnant patient diagnosed with syphilis who has a history of an IgE-mediated allergy to penicillin, the standard of care is to perform penicillin desensitization, immediately followed by the appropriate parenteral penicillin G regimen. This is the only therapeutic strategy that ensures effective treatment for both mother and fetus, thereby preventing the catastrophic outcomes of congenital syphilis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.680 \\times 10^{6}}$$", "id": "5126191"}, {"introduction": "Many congenital infections require prolonged therapy that must be adjusted as the infant grows.

Patient Weight and Monthly Drug Dosing**\n\nThe patient's body weight, $w_m$, at the start of each month $m$ (for $m=1, 2, \\dots, 12$) is determined by the given piecewise-linear model.

Leucovorin (Folinic Acid) Supplementation Schedule**\n\n**Principle:** Pyrimethamine induces toxicity by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme essential for DNA synthesis. This particularly affects rapidly dividing cells, such as hematopoietic precursors in the bone marrow. Folinic acid (leucovorin) is a biologically active form of folate that bypasses the DHFR-mediated block, thus mitigating bone marrow suppression.\n\n**Justified Schedule:**\n- **Dose and Frequency:** A standard approach is to provide leucovorin at a fixed dose, independent of the infant's weight, as the goal is to prevent systemic toxicity rather than achieve a specific therapeutic concentration. A dose of $10 \\, \\text{mg}$ administered orally three times per week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday) for the entire $12$-month duration of pyrimethamine therapy is a coherent and standard plan.\n- **Rationale:** This frequency ensures a continuous supply of reduced folate to counteract the long half-life of pyrimethamine (approximately $90$ hours in adults) and prevent cumulative toxicity. The administration is independent of pyrimethamine doses, as it provides rescue therapy.\n\n**3. Complete Blood Count (CBC) Monitoring Schedule**\n\n**Principle:** Monitoring for adverse effects is critical. The primary anticipated toxicity of pyrimethamine is dose-related bone marrow suppression, manifesting as anemia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia.\n\n**Justified Schedule:**\n- **Rationale:** The risk of myelosuppression is highest at the initiation of therapy and following dose increases. In this problem, the dose effectively increases each month as the infant grows. Therefore, a tapering monitoring schedule is appropriate.\n- **Proposed Schedule:**\n  - **Month 1:** CBC with differential and platelet count weekly. This provides intensive monitoring during the initial exposure period.\n  - **Months 2 and 3:** CBC with differential and platelet count every two weeks. If counts are stable after the first month, the frequency can be safely reduced.\n  - **Months 4 through 12:** CBC with differential and platelet count monthly. This frequency is sufficient to detect late-onset or cumulative toxicity, especially given that drug doses are adjusted monthly. If any significant cytopenia develops, monitoring frequency should be increased, and a dose adjustment of pyrimethamine may be warranted.\n\n**4. Total Cumulative Mass of Pyrimethamine**\n\nThe final task is to compute the total mass of pyrimethamine administered over the $12$-month course. Each month is assumed to have $30$ days. The daily dose for a given month $m$ is $D_{P,m} = 1 \\, \\text{mg/kg} \\times w_m$. The total mass for month $m$ is $M_m = D_{P,m} \\times 30 \\, \\text{days}$.\n\nThe total cumulative mass, $M_{total}$, is the sum of the monthly masses:\n$$M_{total} = \\sum_{m=1}^{12} M_m = \\sum_{m=1}^{12} (w_m \\, \\text{kg} \\times 1 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} \\times 30 \\, \\text{days})$$\n$$M_{total} = 30 \\sum_{m=1}^{12} w_m$$\nThe units of $M_{total}$ will be in milligrams. We must calculate the sum of the monthly weights, $\\sum_{m=1}^{12} w_m$.\n\nThe sum is split into two parts corresponding to the two linear growth phases:\n$$ \\sum_{m=1}^{12} w_m = \\sum_{m=1}^{6} w_m + \\sum_{m=7}^{12} w_m $$\n\nFor the first $6$ months:\n$w_m = 3.0 + 0.5(m-1)$. The weights are $3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5$.\nThe sum is an arithmetic series with $n=6$, first term $a_1 = 3.0$, and last term $a_6 = 5.5$.\n$$ \\sum_{m=1}^{6} w_m = \\frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) = \\frac{6}{2}(3.0 + 5.5) = 3(8.5) = 25.5 \\, \\text{kg} $$\n\nFor the next $6$ months ($m=7$ to $12$):\n$w_m = 5.5 + 0.3(m-6)$. The weights are $5.8, 6.1, 6.4, 6.7, 7.0, 7.3$.\nThe sum is an arithmetic series with $n=6$, first term $a_1 = 5.8$ (for $m=7$), and last term $a_6 = 7.3$ (for $m=12$).\n$$ \\sum_{m=7}^{12} w_m = \\frac{6}{2}(5.8 + 7.3) = 3(13.1) = 39.3 \\, \\text{kg} $$\n\nThe total sum of the monthly starting weights is:\n$$ \\sum_{m=1}^{12} w_m = 25.5 + 39.3 = 64.8 \\, \\text{kg} $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the total cumulative mass of pyrimethamine:\n$$ M_{total} = 30 \\times 64.8 \\, \\text{mg} $$\n$$ M_{total} = 1944 \\, \\text{mg} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
