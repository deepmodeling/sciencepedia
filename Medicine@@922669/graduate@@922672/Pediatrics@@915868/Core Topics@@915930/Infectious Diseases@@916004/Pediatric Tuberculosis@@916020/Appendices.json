Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) result, and $T^-$ be the event of a negative result.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\nThe sensitivity of the test, $Se$, is the probability of a positive test result given that the subject has the infection.\n$$Se = P(T^+ | D) = 0.80$$\nThe specificity of the test, $Sp$, is the probability of a negative test result given that the subject does not have the infection.\n$$Sp = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95$$\nThe pre-test probability of infection, $\\pi$, is the prior probability that the child has the infection.\n$$\\pi = P(D) = 0.30$$\nFrom the pre-test probability, we can deduce the probability of not having the infection:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$$\n\nThe first task is to derive the positive likelihood ratio, $LR^+$. The $LR^+$ is defined as the ratio of the probability of a positive test in an infected individual to the probability of a positive test in an uninfected individual.\n$$LR^+ = \\frac{P(T^+ | D)}{P(T^+ | D^c)}$$\nThe numerator is the sensitivity, $Se$. The denominator, $P(T^+ | D^c)$, is the probability of a false positive. Since a test result for an uninfected individual can be either positive or negative, the sum of their probabilities is $1$:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) + P(T^- | D^c) = 1$$\nWe are given the specificity, $Sp = P(T^- | D^c)$. Therefore, we can express the false positive rate as:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the numerator and denominator into the definition of $LR^+$ yields the formula in terms of sensitivity and specificity:\n$$LR^+ = \\frac{Se}{1 - Sp}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$LR^+ = \\frac{0.80}{1 - 0.95} = \\frac{0.80}{0.05} = \\frac{80}{5} = 16$$\n\nThe second task is to compute the posterior probability of infection after a positive IGRA result, using the odds form of Bayes' theorem. The odds form states:\n$$\\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Pre-test Odds} \\times \\text{Likelihood Ratio}$$\nFirst, we calculate the pre-test odds of infection.

If the odds of an event $B$ are $O(B)$, the probability of the event is given by $P(B) = \\frac{O(B)}{1 + O(B)}$.\nLet the posterior probability be $P(D | T^+)$.\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{\\text{Posterior Odds}}{1 + \\text{Posterior Odds}} = \\frac{48/7}{1 + 48/7}$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we find a common denominator in the denominator:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{48/7}{7/7 + 48/7} = \\frac{48/7}{55/7} = \\frac{48}{55}$$\nThis is the posterior probability of infection given a positive test result.\n\nThe final answer is the pair consisting of the positive likelihood ratio and the posterior probability: $(LR^+, P(D | T^+))$.\nThe pair is $(16, \\frac{48}{55})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 16  \\frac{48}{55} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5192458"}, {"introduction": "Translating treatment guidelines into a practical prescription is a critical skill in pediatric care, particularly for tuberculosis, where multi-drug regimens are standard.
