A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nLet $I$ be the event that the child has influenza, and let $\\neg I$ be the complementary event that the child does not have influenza. Let $T^+$ be the event that the Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Test (RIDT) result is positive.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1.  The pre-test probability of influenza, which is the prior probability or prevalence in the specified clinical scenario:\n    $$P(I) = 0.40$$\n2.  The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease:\n    $$P(T^+|I) = 0.70$$\n3.  The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease. Let $T^-$ denote a negative test result.\n    $$P(T^-|\\neg I) = 0.95$$\n\nOur objective is to calculate the post-test probability of influenza given a positive test result, which is denoted by the conditional probability $P(I|T^+)$. This quantity is also known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV).\n\nWe begin with the fundamental definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nApplying this definition to our specific events, we have:\n$$P(I|T^+) = \\frac{P(I \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe numerator, $P(I \\cap T^+)$, is the joint probability of having influenza and testing positive. We can re-express this using the definition of conditional probability for $P(T^+|I)$:\n$$P(T^+|I) = \\frac{P(I \\cap T^+)}{P(I)} \\implies P(I \\cap T^+) = P(T^+|I) P(I)$$\nThis term is the probability of a true positive result.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, which involves summing the probabilities of a positive test over all possible disease states (having influenza or not having influenza):\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap I) + P(T^+ \\cap \\neg I)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|I) P(I) + P(T^+|\\neg I) P(\\neg I)$$\n\nThe first term, $P(T^+|I) P(I)$, is the probability of a true positive. The second term, $P(T^+|\\neg I) P(\\neg I)$, is the probability of a false positive.\n\nTo evaluate this expression, we need the values of $P(\\neg I)$ and $P(T^+|\\neg I)$.\nThe probability of not having influenza is the complement of having it:\n$$P(\\neg I) = 1 - P(I) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$$\nThe probability $P(T^+|\\neg I)$ is the false positive rate. It is the complement of the specificity, $P(T^-|\\neg I)$, because for a person without the disease, the test can only be negative (true negative) or positive (false positive).\n$$P(T^+|\\neg I) = 1 - P(T^-|\\neg I) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nNow, we can substitute these components back into the main expression for $P(I|T^+)$, which yields Bayes' theorem for this context:\n$$P(I|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|I) P(I)}{P(T^+|I) P(I) + P(T^+|\\neg I) P(\\neg I)}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the post-test probability of influenza given a positive test result.\n\nThe final step is to substitute the given numerical values into this expression to compute the result.\n-   $P(I) = 0.40$\n-   $P(\\neg I) = 0.60$\n-   $P(T^+|I) = 0.70$\n-   $P(T^+|\\neg I) = 0.05$\n\n$$P(I|T^+) = \\frac{(0.70)(0.40)}{(0.70)(0.40) + (0.05)(0.60)}$$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator (probability of a true positive):\n$$P(I \\cap T^+) = 0.70 \\times 0.40 = 0.28$$\nNext, we calculate the probability of a false positive:\n$$P(\\neg I \\cap T^+) = 0.05 \\times 0.60 = 0.03$$\nThe total probability of a positive test is the sum of these two probabilities:\n$$P(T^+) = 0.28 + 0.03 = 0.31$$\nFinally, we compute the post-test probability:\n$$P(I|T^+) = \\frac{0.28}{0.31} \\approx 0.9032258...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(I|T^+) \\approx 0.9032$$\nThus, for this child, the probability of having influenza increases from a pre-test probability of $0.40$ to a post-test probability of approximately $0.9032$ after receiving a positive RIDT result.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9032}\n$$", "id": "5160755"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis of influenza is confidently established, the next step is initiating safe and effective therapy.

The premise that oseltamivir carboxylate (the active metabolite) is primarily eliminated by the kidneys and that its clearance correlates with eGFR is factually correct and a standard assumption in clinical practice. The eGFR values provided are clinically realistic for severe renal impairment and normal function in a child. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a complete set of conditions and constraints. It asks for a single unknown variable, $\\tau_{\\text{adj}}$, based on a series of well-defined relationships between pharmacokinetic parameters. The constraints to maintain both average concentration and fluctuation characteristics with a fixed dose lead to a unique and determinable solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It is free of subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. The inclusion of patient weight and height is contextual information but not strictly necessary for the calculation, as the eGFR is already normalized; this does not constitute a flaw.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will now be derived from first principles.\n\nThe solution requires determining the adjusted dosing interval, $\\tau_{\\text{adj}}$, that maintains two key steady-state parameters: the average concentration, $C_{\\text{ss,avg}}$, and the peak-to-trough fluctuation. We are given that the dose, $D$, bioavailability, $F$, and volume of distribution, $V_d$, are constant.\n\nThe average drug concentration at steady state, $C_{\\text{ss,avg}}$, is given by the ratio of the rate of drug administration to the total body clearance, $CL$.\n$$C_{\\text{ss,avg}} = \\frac{\\text{Dosing Rate}}{\\text{Clearance}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D / \\tau}{CL} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL \\cdot \\tau}$$\nThe condition that $C_{\\text{ss,avg}}$ remains constant between the normal (`norm`) and adjusted (`adj`) states is:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,avg,norm}} = C_{\\text{ss,avg,adj}}$$\n$$\\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL_{\\text{norm}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{norm}}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL_{\\text{adj}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{adj}}}$$\nSince $F$ and $D$ are constant, they cancel, yielding our first relationship:\n$$CL_{\\text{norm}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{norm}} = CL_{\\text{adj}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{adj}}$$\n\nNext, we consider the peak-to-trough fluctuation. For a drug eliminated by first-order kinetics, the concentration decays exponentially between doses. The ratio of the peak concentration at steady state ($C_{\\text{ss,max}}$) to the trough concentration at steady state ($C_{\\text{ss,min}}$) is a measure of this fluctuation.\n$$\\frac{C_{\\text{ss,max}}}{C_{\\text{ss,min}}} = \\exp(k_e \\tau)$$\nwhere $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. To maintain the same fluctuation, the product $k_e \\tau$ must be constant:\n$$k_{e,\\text{norm}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{norm}} = k_{e,\\text{adj}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{adj}}$$\nIt is important to recognize that these two derived conditions are not independent. The fundamental relationship between clearance, volume of distribution, and the elimination rate constant is $CL = k_e \\cdot V_d$. Substituting this into the first relationship gives:\n$$(k_{e,\\text{norm}} \\cdot V_d) \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{norm}} = (k_{e,\\text{adj}} \\cdot V_d) \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{adj}}$$\nSince $V_d$ is constant, it cancels, resulting in $k_{e,\\text{norm}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{norm}} = k_{e,\\text{adj}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{adj}}$, which is identical to the second relationship. This internal consistency confirms that a single adjustment to $\\tau$ can satisfy both objectives simultaneously.\n\nThe problem explicitly requests using the relationship between renal clearance and half-life ($t_{1/2}$). We proceed along this path. The elimination rate constant $k_e$ is related to the half-life $t_{1/2}$ by:\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\nSubstituting this into the fluctuation-invariance condition $k_{e,\\text{norm}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{norm}} = k_{e,\\text{adj}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{adj}}$:\n$$\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2, \\text{norm}}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{norm}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2, \\text{adj}}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{adj}}$$\n$$\\frac{\\tau_{\\text{norm}}}{t_{1/2, \\text{norm}}} = \\frac{\\tau_{\\text{adj}}}{t_{1/2, \\text{adj}}}$$\nRearranging to solve for the adjusted dosing interval, $\\tau_{\\text{adj}}$:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{adj}} = \\tau_{\\text{norm}} \\cdot \\frac{t_{1/2, \\text{adj}}}{t_{1/2, \\text{norm}}}$$\nThis shows that to maintain the pharmacokinetic profile, the dosing interval should be scaled in direct proportion to the drug's elimination half-life.\n\nNow, we must relate the half-life to the given clinical parameter, eGFR. The half-life is defined by the volume of distribution and clearance:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2) \\cdot V_d}{CL}$$\nSince $V_d$ is constant, the half-life is inversely proportional to the total clearance:\n$$t_{1/2} \\propto \\frac{1}{CL}$$\nThe problem states that renal clearance dominates and is directly proportional to eGFR:\n$$CL \\approx CL_R \\propto \\text{eGFR}$$\nCombining these proportionalities, we find that the half-life is inversely proportional to eGFR:\n$$t_{1/2} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\text{eGFR}}$$\nTherefore, the ratio of the half-lives is the inverse of the ratio of the eGFR values:\n$$\\frac{t_{1/2, \\text{adj}}}{t_{1/2, \\text{norm}}} = \\frac{1/\\text{eGFR}_{\\text{adj}}}{1/\\text{eGFR}_{\\text{norm}}} = \\frac{\\text{eGFR}_{\\text{norm}}}{\\text{eGFR}_{\\text{adj}}}$$\nSubstituting this ratio back into our equation for $\\tau_{\\text{adj}}$:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{adj}} = \\tau_{\\text{norm}} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{eGFR}_{\\text{norm}}}{\\text{eGFR}_{\\text{adj}}}$$\nThis final equation provides the adjusted dosing interval based on the initial interval and the ratio of normal to impaired renal function.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\tau_{\\text{norm}} = 12\\ \\text{h}$\n$\\text{eGFR}_{\\text{norm}} = 120\\ \\text{mL/min/1.73 m}^2$\n$\\text{eGFR}_{\\text{adj}} = 30\\ \\text{mL/min/1.73 m}^2$\n$$\\tau_{\\text{adj}} = 12\\ \\text{h} \\times \\frac{120\\ \\text{mL/min/1.73 m}^2}{30\\ \\text{mL/min/1.73 m}^2}$$\n$$\\tau_{\\text{adj}} = 12\\ \\text{h} \\times 4$$\n$$\\tau_{\\text{adj}} = 48\\ \\text{h}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
