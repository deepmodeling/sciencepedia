It is based on the fundamental principles of probability theory, specifically Bayes' theorem, and its application to medical diagnostics. The concepts of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity are standard, well-defined metrics in epidemiology and clinical testing. The values provided ($0.05$ prevalence, $0.90$ sensitivity, $0.98$ specificity) are plausible for a PCR-based assay in a symptomatic population.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant**: The problem is perfectly formalizable using the language of conditional probability and is directly relevant to the field of pediatrics and infectious disease diagnostics.\n3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The problem is complete and self-contained.

There are no contradictions.\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The conditions and data are realistic and feasible.\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The problem is well-posed.

The terminology is precise and unambiguous.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological**: The problem is a standard, non-trivial application of Bayes' theorem that illustrates an important, and often counterintuitive, concept in medical statistics. It is not trivial or tautological.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The problem is mathematically verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a child has pertussis, and let $D^c$ be the event that a child does not have pertussis. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result, and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe information provided can be expressed in terms of conditional probabilities:\n- The prior probability, or prevalence, of the disease is $P(D) = \\pi = 0.05$.\n- The probability of a child not having the disease is the complement of the prevalence: $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$.\n- The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test given that the child has the disease (true positive rate): $P(T^+|D) = 0.90$.\n- The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test given that the child does not have the disease (true negative rate): $P(T^-|D^c) = 0.98$.\n\nFrom the specificity, we can determine the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given that the child does not have the disease:\n$$P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$$\n\nThe objective is to find the posterior probability of disease given a positive test result, which is the Positive Predictive Value (PPV). In probabilistic notation, this is $P(D|T^+)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is given by:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nTo use this formula, we must first calculate the denominator, $P(T^+)$, which is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. This can be found using the law of total probability. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: a true positive (the child has the disease and tests positive) or a false positive (the child does not have the disease but tests positive).\n\nThe total probability $P(T^+)$ is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for $P(T^+)$ into the denominator of Bayes' theorem. This gives the full formula for the PPV in terms of the given quantities:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)}$$\n\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the PPV. Now we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement:\n- $P(D) = 0.05$\n- $P(D^c) = 0.95$\n- $P(T^+|D) = 0.90$\n- $P(T^+|D^c) = 0.02$\n\nSubstituting these into the formula:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{(0.90)(0.05)}{(0.90)(0.05) + (0.02)(0.95)}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the terms in the expression:\n- The numerator, which represents the probability of a true positive in the tested population:\n$$P(T^+ \\cap D) = (0.90)(0.05) = 0.045$$\n- The second term in the denominator, which represents the probability of a false positive in the tested population:\n$$P(T^+ \\cap D^c) = (0.02)(0.95) = 0.019$$\n\nNow, we compute the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = 0.045 + 0.019 = 0.064$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the PPV:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{0.045}{0.064} = 0.703125$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $7, 0, 3, 1$. The digit following is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we do not round up.\nThe final numerical value is $0.7031$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7031}$$", "id": "5195140"}, {"introduction": "Translating a diagnosis into effective treatment requires precision, especially in pediatric medicine where dosing is tailored to the individual.

The specified dose of azithromycin ($10$ mg/kg/day) for pertussis in a young child is a standard, clinically accepted regimen. The available drug concentrations ($100$ mg/$5$ mL and $200$ mg/$5$ mL) are standard pharmaceutical formulations. The rationale for weight-based dosing and the clinical goal of minimizing administration volume for adherence and tolerance are sound principles.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data—the prescribed dosage on a mass basis, the patient's mass, and the available concentrations—to determine a unique solution. The constraint to minimize volume unambiguously directs the choice between the two concentrations.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and quantitative language.\n\nThe problem is free of scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, and internal contradictions. It is a formalizable calculation based on realistic clinical data.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be formulated based on first principles.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first calculating the required mass of azithromycin for a single dose, then selecting the appropriate concentration based on the minimization criterion, and finally calculating the required volume.\n\nLet $m_{child}$ be the mass of the child, which is given as $12$ kg.\nLet $D_{rate}$ be the prescribed dosage rate, which is $10$ mg/kg per day.\n\nThe total mass of azithromycin, $M_{dose}$, required for a single daily dose is calculated by multiplying the child's mass by the dosage rate:\n$$M_{dose} = m_{child} \\times D_{rate}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$M_{dose} = 12 \\text{ kg} \\times 10 \\text{ mg/kg} = 120 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe child requires a dose of $120$ mg of azithromycin once daily. The duration of the course ($5$ days) is irrelevant for calculating the volume of a single dose, as correctly noted in the problem statement.\n\nNext, we must select the appropriate oral suspension. Two concentrations are available:\n1.  Concentration $C_1$: $100$ mg per $5$ mL\n2.  Concentration $C_2$: $200$ mg per $5$ mL\n\nTo facilitate comparison and calculation, these concentrations are converted to units of mg/mL:\n$$C_1 = \\frac{100 \\text{ mg}}{5 \\text{ mL}} = 20 \\text{ mg/mL}$$\n$$C_2 = \\frac{200 \\text{ mg}}{5 \\text{ mL}} = 40 \\text{ mg/mL}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the formulation minimizing the per-dose volume is preferred. The relationship between dose mass ($M_{dose}$), concentration ($C$), and volume ($V$) is:\n$$V = \\frac{M_{dose}}{C}$$\nTo minimize the volume $V$ for a constant dose mass $M_{dose}$, the concentration $C$ must be maximized. Comparing the two available concentrations, $C_2 > C_1$ since $40 \\text{ mg/mL} > 20 \\text{ mg/mL}$. Therefore, the suspension with the concentration of $200$ mg per $5$ mL (or $40$ mg/mL) must be used.\n\nNow, we can calculate the final volume, $V_{administer}$, to be administered using the required dose mass ($M_{dose} = 120$ mg) and the selected concentration ($C_2 = 40$ mg/mL):\n$$V_{administer} = \\frac{M_{dose}}{C_2}$$\n$$V_{administer} = \\frac{120 \\text{ mg}}{40 \\text{ mg/mL}}$$\n$$V_{administer} = 3 \\text{ mL}$$\n\nThus, the child should be administered $3$ mL of the $200$ mg per $5$ mL azithromycin oral suspension once daily.

Assume the following mechanistic and epidemiologic bases:\n\n- Macrolides inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding the $50$S ribosomal subunit, reducing viable organisms and halting toxin production.\n- Culture requires viable colony-forming units (CFU) that can undergo binary fission on selective media; detection typically requires $\\geq 10^2$ viable CFU in the specimen.\n- PCR amplifies target deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) irrespective of viability; higher Ct reflects lower template concentration.\n- After effective macrolide therapy begins at time $t=0$, viable organism burden declines approximately exponentially as $N(t)=N_0 e^{-k t}$, where $N_0$ is the initial viable burden and $k>0$ is the kill-rate constant determined by drug exposure and bacterial susceptibility.\n- Extracellular and intracellular bacterial DNA in respiratory secretions decays after organism death due to nuclease activity and mucociliary clearance, which can be approximated by a first-order process with half-life $h$, giving residual DNA copy number $D(t)=D_0 \\cdot 2^{-t/h}$, where $D_0$ is the initial template abundance available to PCR at $t=0$.\n- For late illness ($\\geq 14$ days after cough onset), the sensitivity of PCR decreases while serology to anti-pertussis toxin Immunoglobulin G (IgG) becomes informative.\n- Bayesian interpretation of diagnostic tests uses sensitivity and specificity to update a prior probability.

The statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, internally consistent, and objective. It presents a realistic clinical challenge that integrates microbiology, pharmacology, molecular diagnostics, and epidemiology. The mathematical models are appropriate simplifications for this context. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe core task is to interpret the discordant results—culture-negative and PCR-positive—in the context of the patient's clinical history and treatment, and to determine the appropriate management.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the patient's status using the provided quantitative models. The patient started azithromycin on day $4$ of illness and was tested on day $12$. The duration of therapy at the time of testing is $t = 12 - 4 = 8$ days.\n\n1.  **Viable Bacterial Burden (Culture Result)**\n    The number of viable organisms, $N(t)$, is modeled by $N(t) = N_0 e^{-kt}$.\n    Given parameters:\n    - Initial viable burden, $N_0 = 10^6$ CFU\n    - Kill-rate constant, $k = 1.5$ day$^{-1}$\n    - Culture detection threshold, $10^2$ CFU\n\n    At $t = 8$ days, the predicted viable burden is:\n    $$ N(8) = 10^6 \\cdot e^{-1.5 \\cdot 8} = 10^6 \\cdot e^{-12} $$\n    Using the approximation $e \\approx 2.718$, we have $e^{12} \\approx 1.627 \\times 10^5$.\n    $$ N(8) \\approx \\frac{10^6}{1.627 \\times 10^5} \\approx 6.14 \\text{ CFU} $$\n    Since $N(8) \\approx 6.14$ CFU is less than the culture detection threshold of $10^2$ CFU, the model predicts a negative culture result. This is consistent with the patient's laboratory findings and suggests that the azithromycin therapy was effective in reducing the number of viable bacteria.\n\n2.  **Residual DNA (PCR Result)**\n    The residual DNA copy number, $D(t)$, is modeled by $D(t) = D_0 \\cdot 2^{-t/h}$.\n    Given parameters:\n    - Initial DNA copy number, $D_0 = 10^6$ copies\n    - DNA decay half-life, $h = 1.5$ days\n    - PCR detection threshold, $10^2$ genome copies\n\n    At $t = 8$ days, the predicted DNA copy number is:\n    $$ D(8) = 10^6 \\cdot 2^{-8/1.5} = 10^6 \\cdot 2^{-5.33\\overline{3}} $$\n    $$ D(8) = 10^6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^{16/3}} = 10^6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2^{16}}} = 10^6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{65536}} \\approx \\frac{10^6}{40.3} \\approx 24800 \\text{ copies} $$\n    Since $D(8) \\approx 24800$ copies is greater than the PCR detection threshold of $10^2$ copies, the model predicts a positive PCR result. This finding is also consistent with the patient's laboratory results. The high cycle threshold (Ct) of $38$ indicates a low concentration of target DNA, which is qualitatively consistent with an exponentially decaying template load, many days after treatment initiation.\n\n3.  **Bayesian Interpretation (Diagnostic Certainty)**\n    The problem provides the necessary parameters to calculate the posterior probability of disease (positive predictive value, PPV) given a positive PCR test.\n    Given parameters:\n    - Prior probability of disease, $P(D) = 0.4$\n    - PCR sensitivity, $Se = 0.6$\n    - PCR specificity, $Sp = 0.98$\n\n    The posterior probability is calculated using the provided formula:\n    $$ PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot P(D)}{Se \\cdot P(D) + (1-Sp) \\cdot (1-P(D))} $$\n    $$ PPV = \\frac{0.6 \\cdot 0.4}{0.6 \\cdot 0.4 + (1-0.98) \\cdot (1-0.4)} $$\n    $$ PPV = \\frac{0.24}{0.24 + (0.02 \\cdot 0.6)} $$\n    $$ PPV = \\frac{0.24}{0.24 + 0.012} = \\frac{0.24}{0.252} = \\frac{240}{252} = \\frac{20}{21} \\approx 0.9524 $$\n    A posterior probability of $\\approx 95.2\\%$ is very high, confirming that despite the culture result, the patient very likely had a recent pertussis infection.\n\nNow I will evaluate each option based on this comprehensive analysis.\n\nA. The most parsimonious explanation is residual DNA from non-viable Bordetella pertussis, consistent with effective macrolide therapy suppressing viable organisms below culture thresholds; isolation need not be extended beyond $5$ days of appropriate therapy, and no repeat macrolide course is indicated.\n- The analysis above demonstrates that it is entirely consistent for viable organisms to be below the culture-detection limit while non-viable bacterial DNA remains detectable by PCR. This is the classic interpretation of such discordant results post-treatment.\n- Standard public health guidelines for pertussis state that an individual is considered non-infectious after completing $5$ days of effective antibiotic therapy. The child is on day $8$ of therapy, so extending isolation is not necessary.\n- Since the evidence points to effective therapy (culture negativity) rather than treatment failure, a repeat antibiotic course is not indicated.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. A positive PCR after macrolide therapy implies ongoing contagiousness; repeat a full $14$-day macrolide course and continue isolation until the PCR becomes negative, because PCR positivity equates to transmissibility.\n- This statement rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of molecular diagnostics. PCR detects specific nucleic acid sequences and cannot differentiate between DNA from live, infectious organisms and DNA from dead organisms. Transmissibility depends on the presence of viable organisms.\n- The management proposed (repeat antibiotics, isolation until PCR is negative) is inappropriate, leading to unnecessary medication and social restriction. Residual DNA can be detectable for weeks after the infection is no longer transmissible.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. Integrate the high Ct ($38$) with the illness timeline to infer low template burden consistent with residual DNA; for illness beyond $14$ days, consider serology to anti-pertussis toxin IgG to support recent infection status, and manage contacts per chemoprophylaxis recommendations without extending patient therapy.\n- The high Ct value ($38$) correctly implies a low concentration of DNA template, which supports the \"residual DNA\" hypothesis.\n- The problem statement specifies that serology becomes informative for illness $\\ge 14$ days. As the child is at day $12$, considering serology as a confirmatory tool is an appropriate part of a comprehensive diagnostic strategy, especially if further confirmation of recent infection is desired.\n- Managing contacts with chemoprophylaxis is a standard public health measure for a confirmed pertussis case.\n- Not extending patient therapy is correct, as treatment appears effective.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\nD. Culture negativity rules out pertussis; therefore, the positive PCR is most likely contamination, since macrolides rapidly clear all bacterial DNA within $24$ hours.\n- This statement contains two significant errors. First, culture for *B. pertussis* has limited sensitivity, especially after antibiotic initiation. A negative culture does not rule out the diagnosis.\n- Second, the claim that macrolides clear all DNA within $24$ hours is biologically incorrect. The problem's own model, with a DNA half-life of $h=1.5$ days, explicitly contradicts this. DNA clearance is a process that takes days to weeks.\n- Given the strong epidemiologic link and compatible symptoms, contamination is a much less probable explanation than a true positive.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE. Apply Bayesian reasoning: with $P(D)=0.4$, $Se=0.6$, and $Sp=0.98$, a positive PCR yields a high posterior probability of recent infection despite likely noninfectious status after $5$ days of therapy; emphasize public health notification and completion of standard isolation duration, without repeat antibiotics solely to turn PCR negative.\n- My calculation confirms that the positive PCR test, even with modest sensitivity, significantly increases the post-test probability of infection to $\\approx 95.2\\%$ given the high pre-test probability and high specificity. This quantifies the diagnostic certainty.\n- The management advice is entirely correct: the patient is no longer infectious after $5$ days of therapy, public health notification is crucial, standard isolation is sufficient, and \"chasing the PCR to negative\" with more antibiotics is inappropriate.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\nOptions A, C, and E present complementary and correct frameworks for interpreting the clinical and laboratory data and outlining appropriate management.
