The problem statement describes a standard scenario in medical biostatistics, modeling disease transmission and manifestation as probabilistic events. The given probabilities for rubella transmission ($0.60$) and subsequent development of Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS) given infection ($0.30$) are plausible simplifications of real-world epidemiological data for a first-trimester infection. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary information provided to calculate the requested probability. The question is unambiguous and asks for a specific quantity based on the provided model. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nLet us define the events based on the problem statement.\nLet $I$ be the event that the fetus is congenitally infected with the Rubella virus (RV).\nLet $D$ be the event that the fetus manifests a major CRS-defining defect.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1. The probability of transplacental fetal transmission at $10$ weeks gestational age is $P(I) = 0.60$.\n2. The probability of developing CRS-defining defects, given that the fetus has been infected, is $P(D \\mid I) = 0.30$.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that the fetus will both be congenitally infected with RV and manifest a major CRS-defining defect. In the language of set theory and probability, this corresponds to the probability of the intersection of events $I$ and $D$, denoted as $P(I \\cap D)$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the calculation should be based on the foundational definition of conditional probability. The conditional probability of event $D$ occurring given that event $I$ has occurred is defined as:\n$$\nP(D \\mid I) = \\frac{P(D \\cap I)}{P(I)}\n$$\nThis definition is valid provided that $P(I) > 0$, which is true in this case since $P(I) = 0.60$.\n\nTo find the probability of the intersection, $P(D \\cap I)$, we can rearrange the definition of conditional probability:\n$$\nP(D \\cap I) = P(D \\mid I) \\times P(I)\n$$\nThis formula states that the probability of both events $D$ and $I$ occurring is the product of the probability of $I$ occurring and the conditional probability of $D$ occurring given that $I$ has occurred.\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values into this equation:\n$$\nP(I) = 0.60\n$$\n$$\nP(D \\mid I) = 0.30\n$$\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n$$\nP(D \\cap I) = (0.30) \\times (0.60)\n$$\n$$\nP(D \\cap I) = 0.18\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.18$ has two significant figures (the digits $1$ and $8$). To express this with three significant figures, we must add a trailing zero, which indicates that the precision is known to that decimal place.\n$$\n0.180\n$$\n\nThus, the probability that the fetus will both be congenitally infected with RV and manifest a major CRS-defining defect is $0.180$. The third assumption given in the problem, that \"CRS-defining defects attributable to RV occur only if the fetus is infected with RV in utero,\" implies $P(D \\mid I^c) = 0$, where $I^c$ is the complement of $I$.

It is objective and free of ambiguity. The problem requests a first-principles derivation, which is a standard and valid task in a scientific or mathematical context. No flaws are identified.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $D$: The event that a child has the disease (true acute rubella infection).\n- $D^c$: The event that a child does not have the disease.\n- $T^+$: The event that the assay result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the assay result is negative.\n\nThe givens can be formally expressed as probabilities:\n- Prevalence, $P(D) = 0.5\\% = 0.005$.\n- Sensitivity, the probability of a positive test given the disease is present, is $P(T^+|D) = 95\\% = 0.95$.\n- Specificity, the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent, is $P(T^-|D^c) = 98\\% = 0.98$.\n\nFrom these, we can deduce two other necessary probabilities:\n- The probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995$.\n- The probability of a positive test given the disease is absent (the false positive rate) is the complement of the specificity: $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$.\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is defined as the posterior probability that the disease is present given a positive test result, which is denoted by the conditional probability $P(D|T^+)$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)} $$\n\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T^+)$, is the probability of having the disease and testing positive. From the definition of conditional probability for sensitivity, $P(T^+|D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(D)}$, we can rearrange to find the numerator:\n$$ P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+|D) \\times P(D) $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. We can expand this using the law of total probability. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: (1) the person has the disease and tests positive, or (2) the person does not have the disease and tests positive.\n$$ P(T^+) = P(D \\cap T^+) + P(D^c \\cap T^+) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term:\n$$ P(T^+) = (P(T^+|D) \\times P(D)) + (P(T^+|D^c) \\times P(D^c)) $$\n\nNow, we substitute the expanded expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into the PPV equation:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) \\times P(D)}{(P(T^+|D) \\times P(D)) + (P(T^+|D^c) \\times P(D^c))} $$\nThis is the expression for PPV derived from first principles. Let us denote prevalence as $p$, sensitivity as $s_e$, and specificity as $s_p$. The expression becomes:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{s_e \\times p}{(s_e \\times p) + ((1 - s_p) \\times (1 - p))} $$\n\n**Calculation of PPV**\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula:\n- $p = P(D) = 0.005$\n- $s_e = P(T^+|D) = 0.95$\n- $s_p = P(T^-|D^c) = 0.98$, which implies $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$.\n- $1 - p = P(D^c) = 0.995$.\n\nThe numerator represents the probability of a true positive result:\n$$ P(T^+|D) \\times P(D) = 0.95 \\times 0.005 = 0.00475 $$\n\nThe denominator consists of the probability of a true positive result plus the probability of a false positive result:\n$$ (P(T^+|D) \\times P(D)) + (P(T^+|D^c) \\times P(D^c)) = (0.95 \\times 0.005) + (0.02 \\times 0.995) $$\n$$ = 0.00475 + 0.0199 = 0.02465 $$\n\nTherefore, the PPV is:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.00475}{0.02465} \\approx 0.19269776876... $$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\text{PPV} \\approx 0.1927 $$\n\n**Justification on False Positives**\n\nThe derivation provides the means to analyze the composition of positive test results. The denominator of the PPV formula, $P(T^+) = (s_e \\times p) + ((1 - s_p) \\times (1 - p))$, is the sum of the probabilities of all positive results.\n- The term $s_e \\times p$ represents the proportion of true positives in the total population.\n- The term $(1 - s_p) \\times (1 - p)$ represents the proportion of false positives in the total population.\n\nIn low-prevalence settings, the prevalence $p$ is a very small number. Consequently:\n1.  The true positive term, $s_e \\times p$, becomes very small because it is a product containing the small term $p$. In our case, this is $0.95 \\times 0.005 = 0.00475$.\n2.  The false positive term, $(1 - s_p) \\times (1 - p)$, is the product of the false positive rate $(1 - s_p)$ and the proportion of the population without the disease $(1 - p)$. Since $p$ is small, $(1 - p)$ is close to $1$. Therefore, this term is primarily determined by the false positive rate $(1-s_p)$. In our case, this is $0.02 \\times 0.995 = 0.0199$.\n\nThe ratio of false positives to true positives is $\\frac{(1 - s_p)(1 - p)}{s_e p} = \\frac{0.0199}{0.00475} \\approx 4.19$. This shows that for every single true positive result, there are more than four false positive results.\n\nThis demonstrates that stand-alone IgM screening in a low-prevalence setting will generate a high proportion of false positives. The vast majority of positive test results (approximately $1 - 0.1927 = 0.8073$, or $80.73\\%$) do not indicate a true infection. This matters critically in pediatrics because a false positive diagnosis can cause significant parental anxiety, lead to unnecessary follow-up procedures, and potentially result in incorrect public health actions or medical advice. Therefore, any positive result from such a screening program is highly suspect and must be confirmed with a more specific diagnostic method (such as serological testing of paired sera) before a definitive diagnosis is made.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1927}\n$$", "id": "5168957"}, {"introduction": "Effective public health policy for vaccine-preventable diseases like measles requires a quantitative grasp of herd immunity.
