Before proceeding to a solution, a rigorous validation of the problem statement is mandatory.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe explicit data and definitions provided in the problem statement are as follows:\n- A $16$-year-old patient presents with a painless genital ulcer.\n- $D$ is the event “the patient has early syphilis.”\n- The pre-test probability of early syphilis is $\\mathbb{P}(D) = 0.12$.\n- $E$ is the combined evidence “treponemal immunoassay reactive and RPR reactive with titer $\\leq 1{:}2$.”\n- The conditional probability of the evidence given the disease is $\\mathbb{P}(E \\mid D) = 0.18$.\n- The conditional probability of the evidence given the absence of the disease is $\\mathbb{P}(E \\mid \\neg D) = 0.03$.\n- The objective is to compute the post-test probability $\\mathbb{P}(D \\mid E)$.\n- The final answer must be a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the established criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in the principles of probability theory, specifically Bayes' theorem, and applies them to a standard clinical diagnostic scenario. Syphilis diagnosis using treponemal and non-treponemal (RPR) tests is a well-established medical practice. The given probabilities, while specific to the problem, are plausible within a clinical context. The problem does not violate scientific principles.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information—the prior probability $\\mathbb{P}(D)$ and the conditional probabilities $\\mathbb{P}(E \\mid D)$ and $\\mathbb{P}(E \\mid \\neg D)$—to uniquely determine the posterior probability $\\mathbb{P}(D \\mid E)$. The question is unambiguous.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using clear, objective, and precise mathematical and medical terminology. It is free of subjective or opinion-based claims.\n- **Flaw Analysis**:\n    - The problem is scientifically sound, formalizable, and directly relevant to the specified topic of *sexually transmitted infections in adolescents* within the field of *pediatrics*.\n    - The setup is complete and consistent; no data is missing or contradictory.\n    - The scenario is medically and mathematically realistic.\n    - The structure is that of a standard Bayesian inference problem, which admits a unique, stable solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed. A solution may be derived.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to calculate the post-test probability of early syphilis, $\\mathbb{P}(D \\mid E)$, given the evidence $E$.

The probability of this event, $\\mathbb{P}(\\neg D)$, is the complement of $\\mathbb{P}(D)$.\n\nWe are given the following probabilities from the problem statement:\n- The prior probability of disease: $\\mathbb{P}(D) = 0.12$.\n- The probability of evidence given disease (sensitivity of the test combination): $\\mathbb{P}(E \\mid D) = 0.18$.\n- The probability of evidence given no disease (false positive rate): $\\mathbb{P}(E \\mid \\neg D) = 0.03$.\n\nFrom the prior probability $\\mathbb{P}(D)$, we can calculate its complement:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\neg D) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(D) = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88\n$$\nNow, we can compute the total probability of the evidence, $\\mathbb{P}(E)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(E) = (\\mathbb{P}(E \\mid D) \\times \\mathbb{P}(D)) + (\\mathbb{P}(E \\mid \\neg D) \\times \\mathbb{P}(\\neg D))\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(E) = (0.18 \\times 0.12) + (0.03 \\times 0.88)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(E) = 0.0216 + 0.0264\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(E) = 0.0480\n$$\nThe numerator of Bayes' theorem is the joint probability $\\mathbb{P}(E \\cap D)$, which is $\\mathbb{P}(E \\mid D) \\mathbb{P}(D)$. We have already calculated this term:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(E \\mid D) \\mathbb{P}(D) = 0.18 \\times 0.12 = 0.0216\n$$\nFinally, we can compute the post-test probability, $\\mathbb{P}(D \\mid E)$, by substituting the numerator and denominator into Bayes' theorem:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(D \\mid E) = \\frac{0.0216}{0.0480}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(D \\mid E) = 0.45\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

From the principle of inclusion-exclusion, this is $P(I_G \\cup I_C) = P(I_G) + P(I_C) - P(I_G \\cap I_C)$.\n\nThe overall probability of acquiring gonorrhea is the product of the assailant's infection prevalence and the transmission probability:\n$$R_G = P(I_G) = P(S_G) \\times \\tau_G = 0.06 \\times 0.50 = 0.03$$\nSimilarly, the overall probability of acquiring chlamydia is:\n$$R_C = P(I_C) = P(S_C) \\times \\tau_C = 0.12 \\times 0.25 = 0.03$$\n\nThe probability of acquiring both infections requires the assailant to have both infections and for both to be transmitted. Given that the transmission events are independent conditional on assailant coinfection:\n$$R_{GC} = P(I_G \\cap I_C) = P(S_G \\cap S_C) \\times \\tau_G \\times \\tau_C = 0.02 \\times 0.50 \\times 0.25 = 0.0025$$\n\nThe baseline risk of acquiring at least one infection, which we denote as $R_{\\text{untreated}}$, is:\n$$R_{\\text{untreated}} = R_G + R_C - R_{GC} = 0.03 + 0.03 - 0.0025 = 0.0575$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the risk of infection in the intervention population**\nThe intervention involves offering treatment, but only a fraction $P_A = 0.70$ of individuals adhere. The remaining fraction, $1 - P_A = 0.30$, are non-adherent and receive no prophylactic benefit, so their risk remains $R_{\\text{untreated}}$.\n\nFor adherent individuals, the risk of each infection is reduced. The risk of an event occurring in a treated group is the baseline risk multiplied by the relative risk ($RR = 1 - RRR = 1 - E$).\nRisk of gonorrhea in an adherent person:\n$$R_{G, \\text{adh}} = R_G \\times (1 - E_G) = 0.03 \\times (1 - 0.90) = 0.03 \\times 0.10 = 0.003$$\nRisk of chlamydia in an adherent person:\n$$R_{C, \\text{adh}} = R_C \\times (1 - E_C) = 0.03 \\times (1 - 0.85) = 0.03 \\times 0.15 = 0.0045$$\n\nThe problem states that regimen effects on each pathogen act independently. This implies that the relative risk for the joint outcome is the product of the individual relative risks.\nRisk of acquiring both infections in an adherent person:\n$$R_{GC, \\text{adh}} = R_{GC} \\times (1 - E_G) \\times (1 - E_C) = 0.0025 \\times (1 - 0.90) \\times (1 - 0.85) = 0.0025 \\times 0.10 \\times 0.15 = 0.0000375$$\n\nThe risk of acquiring at least one infection in an adherent person, denoted $R_{\\text{adherent}}$, is:\n$$R_{\\text{adherent}} = R_{G, \\text{adh}} + R_{C, \\text{adh}} - R_{GC, \\text{adh}} = 0.003 + 0.0045 - 0.0000375 = 0.0074625$$\n\nThe overall risk in the intervention population, $R_{\\text{treated}}$, is the weighted average of the risks in the adherent and non-adherent subgroups:\n$$R_{\\text{treated}} = R_{\\text{adherent}} \\times P_A + R_{\\text{untreated}} \\times (1 - P_A)$$\n$$R_{\\text{treated}} = (0.0074625 \\times 0.70) + (0.0575 \\times 0.30)$$\n$$R_{\\text{treated}} = 0.00522375 + 0.01725 = 0.02247375$$\n\n**Step 3: Derive ARR and calculate NNT**\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is the difference in risk between the untreated (control) population and the treated (intervention) population.\n$$ARR = R_{\\text{untreated}} - R_{\\text{treated}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{\\text{treated}}$:\n$$ARR = R_{\\text{untreated}} - [R_{\\text{adherent}} \\times P_A + R_{\\text{untreated}} \\times (1 - P_A)]$$\n$$ARR = R_{\\text{untreated}} - R_{\\text{adherent}} P_A - R_{\\text{untreated}} + R_{\\text{untreated}} P_A$$\n$$ARR = (R_{\\text{untreated}} - R_{\\text{adherent}}) P_A$$\nThis is the derived expression for the ARR attributable to the intervention.

It represents the average number of people who must be offered the intervention to prevent one adverse outcome (in this case, at least one infection).\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} = \\frac{1}{0.03502625} \\approx 28.5500089$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final NNT to two significant figures.
