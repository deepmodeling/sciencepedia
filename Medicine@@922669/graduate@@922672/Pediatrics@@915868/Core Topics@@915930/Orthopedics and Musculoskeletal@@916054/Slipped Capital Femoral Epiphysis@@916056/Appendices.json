It is scientifically grounded in established principles of pediatric orthopedics and biostatistics, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is presented in objective, clinical language. The scenario describes a classic presentation of Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE), and the requested calculation is a standard statistical procedure.\n\nThe problem asks for two main determinations: first, a qualitative assessment of whether the clinical findings support a diagnosis of Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE), and second, a quantitative calculation of the standardized deficit for the patient's left hip internal rotation.\n\nFirst, we address the clinical assessment. SCFE is a condition affecting adolescents where the capital femoral epiphysis (the \"ball\" of the hip joint) displaces from its normal position atop the femoral neck, typically in a posterior and inferior direction. This anatomical displacement has direct biomechanical consequences that manifest as characteristic signs on physical examination. The posterior slip of the epiphysis creates a mechanical impingement at the front of the hip joint (anterior acetabular rim) when the hip is flexed. This impingement physically blocks internal rotation and forces the entire femur to rotate externally. This phenomenon is known as \"obligate external rotation on flexion\" and is a pathognomonic sign of SCFE.\n\nThe patient, a $13$-year-old male, presents with symptoms (activity-related groin/knee pain, antalgic gait) and signs that are highly consistent with this pathophysiology. The key finding is the dramatic asymmetry in passive hip internal rotation, measured with the hips flexed to $90^{\\circ}$: the left hip has only $6^{\\circ}$ of internal rotation, while the right hip has a normal $38^{\\circ}$. This profound loss of internal rotation on the left side, combined with the observation of \"obligate external rotation during flexion,\" strongly points to a posterior slip of the left capital femoral epiphysis. The clinical picture is therefore highly suggestive of left-sided SCFE.\n\nNext, we quantify the deficit by computing the standardized score (z-score) for the left hip's internal rotation. The z-score measures the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean of its reference distribution. The formula for the z-score is:\n$$ z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} $$\nwhere $x$ is the observed value, $\\mu$ is the population mean, and $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following values:\nThe patient's measured left hip internal rotation: $x = 6^{\\circ}$.\nThe population mean for adolescents aged $12$–$14$ years: $\\mu = 40^{\\circ}$.\nThe population standard deviation: $\\sigma = 8^{\\circ}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the z-score formula:\n$$ z = \\frac{6 - 40}{8} $$\nFirst, we calculate the difference between the observed value and the mean:\n$$ z = \\frac{-34}{8} $$\nNow, we perform the division:\n$$ z = -4.25 $$\nThe standardized deficit is $-4.25$. This indicates that the patient's left hip internal rotation is $4.25$ standard deviations below the average for his age group, which is a statistically extreme and clinically significant deviation.\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $-4.25$ already contains exactly three significant figures ($4$, $2$, and $5$). Thus, no further rounding is required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-4.25}$$", "id": "5205824"}, {"introduction": "Following clinical suspicion, radiographic imaging is essential for confirming the diagnosis and classifying the severity of SCFE. This practice focuses on applying the Southwick slip angle, a cornerstone of radiographic assessment that quantifies epiphyseal displacement on frog-leg lateral views [@problem_id:5205844]. Mastering the calculation of this angle and applying established classification thresholds is a critical competency for guiding urgent treatment decisions.", "problem": "A 13-year-old adolescent presents with right hip pain and an antalgic gait. Bilateral frog-leg lateral radiographs are obtained. On each side, the epiphyseal–shaft angle is measured as the angle between the longitudinal axis of the femoral shaft and the line perpendicular to the capital femoral physis, consistent with the method described by Southwick. For classification of Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) severity, use the side-to-side difference in this angle between the affected and the unaffected hip (the Southwick slip angle difference), with the following well-established thresholds: mild if the difference is less than $30^{\\circ}$, moderate if the difference is between $30^{\\circ}$ and $50^{\\circ}$ inclusive, and severe if the difference is greater than $50^{\\circ}$.

The described clinical scenario, diagnostic measures, and classification system for Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) are standard in pediatric orthopedics. The mathematical task is a straightforward application of arithmetic and unit conversion.\n\nThe objective is to compute the Southwick slip angle difference, classify the severity of the slip, and express the results in a specified format.\n\nFirst, we calculate the side-to-side difference in the epiphyseal–shaft angle, denoted as $\\Delta\\theta_{\\text{deg}}$. The problem provides the angle for the affected right hip, $\\theta_{\\text{affected}} = 73^{\\circ}$, and for the unaffected left hip, $\\theta_{\\text{unaffected}} = 14^{\\circ}$.

Therefore, for this case:\n\n$$\nS = 3\n$$\n\nNext, we must convert the angle difference from degrees to radians, as required. The relationship between degrees and radians stems from the geometric definition of an angle. A complete revolution, corresponding to a full circle, is defined as $360^{\\circ}$ or, in terms of the ratio of circumference to radius, $2\\pi$ radians. This establishes the fundamental equivalence:\n\n$$\n360^{\\circ} = 2\\pi \\text{ radians}\n$$\n\nFrom this, we derive the conversion factor for converting degrees to radians:\n\n$$\n1^{\\circ} = \\frac{2\\pi}{360} \\text{ radians} = \\frac{\\pi}{180} \\text{ radians}\n$$\n\nLet $\\Delta\\theta_{\\text{rad}}$ be the angle difference in radians.

To assess residual cam-type deformity contributing to Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI), a true lateral Dunn radiograph is obtained and digitally calibrated at $s = 0.150$ millimeters per pixel. On the radiograph, a best-fit circle to the femoral head is computed from the contour and yields a center at $C = (210.0,\\ 100.0)$ in pixel coordinates. The longitudinal axis of the femoral neck is defined by two points along the centerline of the neck, $A = (130.0,\\ 90.0)$ and $B = (190.0,\\ 90.0)$, measured in pixel coordinates. The anterior head-neck contour point at which the osseous profile deviates from the circular head contour (the first point marking loss of sphericity) is identified at $E = (235.0,\\ 143.30127)$ in pixel coordinates.

We will use vector analysis to compute this angle.\n\nFirst, we define the vectors corresponding to the femoral neck axis and the radius to the point of contour deviation. The given points are:\n- Femoral head center: $C = (210.0, 100.0)$\n- Points defining the femoral neck axis: $A = (130.0, 90.0)$ and $B = (190.0, 90.0)$\n- Point of contour deviation: $E = (235.0, 143.30127)$\n\nA direction vector for the femoral neck axis, $\\vec{v}_{\\text{neck}}$, can be defined by the vector from point $A$ to point $B$.\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{\\text{neck}} = B - A = (190.0 - 130.0, 90.0 - 90.0) = (60.0, 0.0)\n$$\nThis vector represents the orientation of the femoral neck axis.\n\nNext, we define the vector from the femoral head center, $C$, to the point of contour deviation, $E$.
