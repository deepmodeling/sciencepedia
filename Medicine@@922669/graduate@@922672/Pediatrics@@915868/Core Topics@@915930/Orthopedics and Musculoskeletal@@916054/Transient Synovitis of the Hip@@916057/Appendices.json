The stated incidence of $0.2\\%$ ($200$ cases per $100,000$ individuals) is a realistic figure for this condition in the pediatric population. The premises are factually and scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data and assumptions to calculate the required quantities. The objectives are clearly defined, and a unique solution exists.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n-   **Other Flaws**: The problem contains no scientific fallacies, contradictions, or ambiguities. The assumptions, such as uniform distribution of cases, are standard simplifications used in epidemiological modeling and do not invalidate the problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the expected number of new cases per year and the expected number of new cases per week.\n\nFirst, we calculate the expected number of new cases per year, denoted by $C_{\\text{year}}$. The incidence proportion, $I_{\\text{prop}}$, is defined as the number of new cases occurring in a population over a specified period divided by the size of the population at the beginning of that period.\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$I_{\\text{prop}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{year}}}{N_{\\text{pop}}}$$\nThe given values are $N_{\\text{pop}} = 200,000$ and $I_{\\text{prop}} = 0.2\\%$. We must convert the percentage to a decimal fraction:\n$$I_{\\text{prop}} = 0.2\\% = \\frac{0.2}{100} = 0.002$$\nWe can now solve for $C_{\\text{year}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{year}} = I_{\\text{prop}} \\times N_{\\text{pop}}$$\n$$C_{\\text{year}} = 0.002 \\times 200,000 = 400$$\nThe problem states that all new cases present to the tertiary clinic, so the expected number of new cases presenting to the clinic annually is $400$. The problem requires this value to be reported to three significant figures. The integer $400$ is an exact result of the calculation. To explicitly denote three significant figures, we express it in scientific notation as $4.00 \\times 10^2$.\n\nSecond, we calculate the expected number of new cases per week, denoted by $C_{\\text{week}}$. The problem specifies a year has $52$ weeks and that case occurrence is uniformly distributed. Therefore, we can find the average weekly case count by dividing the annual case count by the number of weeks in a year.\nLet $W_{\\text{year}} = 52$ be the number of weeks in a year.\n$$C_{\\text{week}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{year}}}{W_{\\text{year}}}$$\n$$C_{\\text{week}} = \\frac{400}{52}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$C_{\\text{week}} \\approx 7.692307...$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $7$, $6$, and $9$. The fourth significant figure is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the third digit).\n$$C_{\\text{week}} \\approx 7.69$$\nThe final answer consists of these two values presented in the specified order (annual count, weekly count).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4.00 \\times 10^2  7.69\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5212825"}, {"introduction": "The core clinical challenge with a painful hip in a child is distinguishing benign transient synovitis from the emergent diagnosis of septic arthritis.
