Derivation of Likelihood Ratios and Confirmation via Bayes' Theorem**\n\nFirst, we derive the likelihood ratios from sensitivity and specificity.\n\nThe positive likelihood ratio ($LR^+$) is the ratio of the probability of a positive test in the diseased group to the probability of a positive test in the non-diseased group.\n$$\nLR^+ = \\frac{P(T^+|D^+)}{P(T^+|D^-)} = \\frac{\\text{Sensitivity}}{1 - \\text{Specificity}}\n$$\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$\n1 - \\text{Specificity} = 1 - \\frac{7670}{7880} = \\frac{7880 - 7670}{7880} = \\frac{210}{7880} = \\frac{21}{788}\n$$\n$$\nLR^+ = \\frac{0.75}{210/7880} = \\frac{3/4}{21/788} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{788}{21} = \\frac{788}{4 \\times 7} = \\frac{788}{28} = \\frac{197}{7} \\approx 28.14\n$$\n\nThe negative likelihood ratio ($LR^-$) is the ratio of the probability of a negative test in the diseased group to the probability of a negative test in the non-diseased group.\n$$\nLR^- = \\frac{P(T^-|D^+)}{P(T^-|D^-)} = \\frac{1 - \\text{Sensitivity}}{\\text{Specificity}}\n$$\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$\n1 - \\text{Sensitivity} = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n$$\nLR^- = \\frac{0.25}{7670/7880} = \\frac{1/4}{767/788} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{788}{767} = \\frac{197}{767} \\approx 0.2568\n$$\n\nNext, we apply Bayes' theorem in odds form: Post-test odds = Pre-test odds $\\times$ LR.\n\nThe pre-test probability of DDH is the prevalence in the cohort.\n$$\nP(\\text{Pre-test}) = P(D^+) = \\frac{TP + FN}{N} = \\frac{120}{8000} = \\frac{12}{800} = \\frac{3}{200} = 0.015\n$$\nThe pre-test odds of DDH are:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}(\\text{Pre-test}) = \\frac{P(D^+)}{1 - P(D^+)} = \\frac{0.015}{1 - 0.015} = \\frac{0.015}{0.985} = \\frac{15}{985} = \\frac{3}{197}\n$$\n\nTo confirm PPV, we calculate the post-test odds given a positive test:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}(\\text{Post-test, } T^+) = \\text{Odds}(\\text{Pre-test}) \\times LR^+ = \\frac{3}{197} \\times \\frac{197}{7} = \\frac{3}{7}\n$$\nConvert post-test odds to probability (which is the PPV):\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = P(D^+|T^+) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(\\text{Post-test, } T^+)}{1 + \\text{Odds}(\\text{Post-test, } T^+)} = \\frac{3/7}{1 + 3/7} = \\frac{3/7}{10/7} = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.3\n$$\nThis matches the value of PPV calculated directly, confirming the result.\n\nTo confirm NPV, we calculate the post-test odds of disease given a negative test:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}(\\text{Post-test, } T^-) = \\text{Odds}(\\text{Pre-test}) \\times LR^- = \\frac{3}{197} \\times \\frac{197}{767} = \\frac{3}{767}\n$$\nThis is the odds of having the disease despite a negative test.

Therefore:\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = P(D^-|T^-) = 1 - P(D^+|T^-) = 1 - \\frac{3}{770} = \\frac{767}{770}\n$$\nThis matches the value of NPV calculated directly, confirming the result.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Summary Discriminative Performance Metric**\n\nThe problem defines this metric as the difference between the sum of sensitivity and specificity and $1$. This is also known as Youden's J statistic.\n$$\nJ = \\text{Sensitivity} + \\text{Specificity} - 1\n$$\nSubstituting the derived exact values:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{90}{120} + \\frac{7670}{7880} - 1 = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{767}{788} - 1\n$$\nTo compute the numerical value:\n$$\nJ = 0.75 + 0.9733502538... - 1 = 1.7233502538... - 1 = 0.7233502538...\n$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures, we get $0.7234$.\n\nA brief qualitative interpretation of the clinical implications:\nThe sensitivity of $0.75$ means the screen misses $25\\%$ of infants with DDH ($30$ cases in this cohort), who are at risk for delayed diagnosis and more complex treatment. The specificity is high at approximately $0.973$, meaning the test correctly identifies most healthy infants. However, the positive predictive value (PPV) is low at $0.30$. This indicates that out of $10$ infants who screen positive and are sent for orthopedic evaluation, $7$ are actually healthy (false positives). This creates parental anxiety and incurs additional healthcare costs. In contrast, the negative predictive value (NPV) is very high at approximately $0.996$, providing strong reassurance that an infant with a negative screen is highly unlikely to have DDH. The core clinical trade-off is between the harm of missing cases ($FN=30$) and the burden of over-investigating healthy infants due to false positives ($FP=210$). The low prevalence of the disease ($1.5\\%$) is a major factor driving the low PPV.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.7234}\n$$", "id": "5132539"}, {"introduction": "Effective clinical practice requires adapting established guidelines to unique patient factors.

Account for prematurity using corrected age (CA).\n    2. Minimize false positives from physiological neonatal laxity.\n    3.

Key concepts such as DDH, risk factors (breech presentation, female sex), corrected age for premature infants, physiological laxity, and the physics of diagnostic imaging (ultrasonography vs. radiography) are all scientifically valid and central to the clinical scenario.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The question asks for the best plan, which, in a clinical context, translates to the plan that adheres most closely to evidence-based guidelines. Such guidelines are designed to optimize diagnostic accuracy while minimizing iatrogenic harm (e.g., unnecessary radiation, anxiety from false positives, or costs). A single best choice among the options is expected to exist based on these established standards.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, clinical language. The patient data and the guiding principles for the decision are presented factually.\n\nThe problem is free of scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, and internal contradictions. The scenario represents a common and realistic clinical challenge. All necessary information to derive a logically sound answer based on medical science is provided.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived by applying fundamental principles of pediatric medicine and physics.\n\n**Derivation of the Correct Approach**\n\nFirst, we must establish the developmental timeline for this specific infant using corrected age. Corrected age (CA) adjusts for prematurity and is calculated relative to a term birth at $40$ weeks GA.\n\n1.  **Degree of Prematurity**: The infant was born at a GA of $32$ weeks. The degree of prematurity is $40 \\text{ weeks} - 32 \\text{ weeks} = 8 \\text{ weeks}$.\n2.  **Corrected Age Calculation**: The formula is `CA = ChA - (Degree of Prematurity)`.\n    At the current visit, the infant's ChA is $6$ weeks. Therefore, her CA is $6 \\text{ weeks} - 8 \\text{ weeks} = -2 \\text{ weeks}$. This means she is developmentally equivalent to a fetus at $38$ weeks GA. She has not yet reached her term-equivalent due date.\n\nNext, we apply the principles of DDH screening and imaging physics.\n\n3.  **Timing of Ultrasonography (US)**: US is the modality of choice in early infancy because the femoral head and much of the acetabulum are cartilaginous, which is poorly visualized on radiographs but excellently visualized by ultrasound. To minimize false-positive results from transient physiological ligamentous laxity common in newborns (especially those exposed to maternal hormones), screening US is typically deferred until at least $4$ to $6$ weeks of age in term infants. For premature infants, this timeline must be based on corrected age. Therefore, the optimal window for screening US for this infant is at a CA of $4$ to $6$ weeks.\n    -   To find the required ChA for this screening window: `ChA = CA + (Degree of Prematurity)`.\n    -   `ChA = ($4 \\text{ to } 6 \\text{ weeks}) + 8 \\text{ weeks} = 12 \\text{ to } 14 \\text{ weeks}`.\n    -   Performing US at the current visit (ChA $6$ weeks, CA $-2$ weeks) is inappropriate and too early.\n\n4.  **Role and Timing of Radiography**: Radiography (X-ray) relies on the differential attenuation of X-rays by tissues of different densities, making it ideal for visualizing ossified bone. Its utility in DDH evaluation is dependent on the presence of the femoral head ossific nucleus, which serves as a crucial landmark. This nucleus typically appears at a CA of $4$ to $6$ months. Before its appearance, radiographs are unreliable for assessing the relationship between the femoral head and acetabulum. Therefore, radiography is the imaging standard for infants older than CA $4$ to $6$ months, but not before.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. **Perform hip ultrasonography (US) today at ChA $6$ weeks, and if normal, obtain a pelvic radiograph at ChA $4$ months, because ex utero maturation accelerates ossification in premature infants.**\n-   US at ChA $6$ weeks (CA $-2$ weeks) is too early and violates the principle of waiting to avoid false positives.\n-   A radiograph at ChA $4$ months ($16$ weeks) corresponds to a CA of $16 - 8 = 8$ weeks, or $2$ months. The ossific nucleus will almost certainly be absent, rendering the radiograph uninformative.\n-   The premise that `ex utero maturation accelerates ossification` is biologically incorrect; development, including ossification, follows the corrected age timeline.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nB. **Defer hip ultrasonography (US) until CA $4$ to $6$ weeks (which corresponds to approximately ChA $12$ to $14$ weeks for this infant), and if US is normal, consider pelvic radiography at CA $4$ to $6$ months only if clinically indicated, because cartilaginous landmarks are optimally visualized by US before ossification, and radiographs are reliable once the femoral head ossific nucleus has emerged.**\n-   The timing for US (CA $4$ to $6$ weeks or ChA $12$ to $14$ weeks) is correct based on our derivation.\n-   The indication and timing for follow-up radiography (CA $4$ to $6$ months, `only if clinically indicated`) are also correct. Routine radiography is not needed after a normal screening US.\n-   The justifications provided—US for cartilage, radiographs for ossified bone—are scientifically accurate and consistent with the physics of each modality.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\nC. **Skip ultrasonography and obtain an anteroposterior pelvic radiograph today at ChA $6$ weeks, because radiography is more sensitive than US for acetabular dysplasia in premature infants.**\n-   A radiograph at this age (CA $-2$ weeks) is the wrong modality, as the key anatomical structures are cartilaginous and thus invisible on X-ray.\n-   The claim that radiography is more sensitive than US in this context is false. US is the gold standard for evaluating the unossified infant hip.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. **Obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at CA $0$ to $2$ weeks to avoid false positives from physiological laxity, followed by repeat MRI at ChA $4$ months to confirm maturation.**\n-   MRI is not a screening tool for DDH due to its high cost, limited availability, and the frequent need for sedation in infants.\n-   The timing of CA $0$ to $2$ weeks is still too early and would not reliably avoid findings of physiological laxity.\n-   This approach is clinically and economically unjustifiable.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE. **Perform hip ultrasonography (US) at CA $0$ to $2$ weeks to detect early dislocations, and then schedule pelvic radiography at CA $3$ months to evaluate acetabular development.**\n-   US at CA $0$ to $2$ weeks is earlier than the recommended $4$ to $6$ week window for screening, increasing the risk of false positives. While it might detect a teratologic dislocation, that is not the goal of a routine risk-based screening program for developmental dysplasia.\n-   Radiography at CA $3$ months is generally too early, as the ossific nucleus is unlikely to be present or sufficiently large for reliable measurements.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5132584"}, {"introduction": "Expert diagnostic reasoning often involves interpreting seemingly contradictory data. This case [@problem_id:5132544] presents a classic but challenging dilemma in DDH sonography: a morphologically normal hip that is functionally unstable.

A normal alpha angle in the presence of dynamic subluxation implies a nonreducing mechanical block by the labrum; immediate open reduction is indicated to prevent iatrogenic avascular necrosis.", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid clinical scenario that tests the core principles of diagnosing and managing developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). The case is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. The data provided are consistent with a known clinical presentation.\n\n**Derivation of Principles**\n\nThe patient is a $4$-week-old infant with a positive Barlow sign, which is a definitive clinical sign of a dislocatable, unstable hip. The risk factors of female sex and breech birth further increase the index of suspicion for DDH.\n\nThe investigation involves two key ultrasound components: static morphology and dynamic stability.\n\n1.  **Static Morphology (Graf Method)**: The Graf alpha angle ($\\alpha$) measures the inclination of the bony acetabular roof. An angle of $65^{\\circ}$ corresponds to a Graf Type I hip, which is considered morphologically mature and normal. This means the osseous (bony) structure of the hip socket is well-formed at the time of the examination.\n\n2.  **Dynamic Stability (Harcke Method/Stress Views)**: Dynamic ultrasound assesses the functional stability of the hip joint. Femoral head coverage quantifies the percentage of the femoral head that is covered by the acetabulum. A decrease in femoral head coverage from $60\\%$ at rest to $20\\%$ under posterior stress signifies severe instability. The femoral head is easily pushed out of the socket (subluxated). This sonographic finding confirms the clinical Barlow sign.\n\nThe central task is to reconcile these two findings. A morphologically normal bony socket ($\\alpha > 60^{\\circ}$) can coexist with significant clinical and sonographic instability. This is because hip stability in an infant is provided not only by the bony geometry but also by the soft tissue constraints: the cartilaginous labrum and the joint capsule with its ligaments. In early infancy, physiologic ligamentous laxity, which can be exacerbated by maternal hormones or genetic predisposition, may lead to capsular laxity that is insufficient to contain the femoral head, even in a well-shaped acetabulum.\n\nThe primary goal of DDH management in infants is to ensure stable, concentric reduction of the femoral head within the acetabulum. According to the Hueter-Volkmann principle (pressure inhibits growth, tension stimulates growth), a well-centered femoral head provides the necessary mechanical stimulus for the acetabulum to develop normally. An unstable hip, regardless of its initial bony morphology, will lead to abnormal pressure distribution and subsequent maldevelopment (secondary acetabular dysplasia). Therefore, functional instability is the primary indication for treatment in this age group.\n\nFor an unstable but reducible hip in an infant younger than $6$ months, the standard first-line treatment is a dynamic flexion-abduction orthosis, the most common of which is the Pavlik harness. This device maintains the hip in a stable position, allowing the lax capsule to tighten and promoting normal acetabular development. Close follow-up, typically with ultrasound within $1-2$ weeks, is essential to confirm the effectiveness of the harness in maintaining reduction.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The normal alpha angle confirms adequate acetabular development and excludes clinically significant instability; observation without intervention is indicated, as stress-induced translation is within normal neonatal laxity.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. A normal alpha angle does not exclude instability. The clinical exam (Barlow positive) and dynamic ultrasound ($40\\%$ change in coverage) unequivocally demonstrate clinically significant instability. Attributing this to \"normal neonatal laxity\" and recommending observation would be a serious mismanagement of a pathologically unstable hip.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. The alpha angle measures static osseous morphology, whereas dynamic subluxation reveals functional capsulolabral instability; stability governs early management to ensure concentric reduction for remodeling, so initiate a Pavlik harness and reassess stability with ultrasound within $1$ week.**\nThis option provides a perfect reconciliation of the findings. It correctly differentiates between static morphology (alpha angle) and functional stability (dynamic assessment). It correctly asserts that stability is the paramount factor governing treatment in early infancy to guide proper joint development. The proposed management—initiation of a Pavlik harness and prompt follow-up—is the standard of care for this specific clinical presentation.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. The discrepancy is best explained by sonographer measurement error; a repeat static morphology assessment (alpha angle and beta angle) without stress testing is sufficient, and no treatment is required unless alpha angle declines below $60^{\\circ}$.**\nDismissing a finding that is corroborated by the physical exam as measurement error is poor practice. The clinical Barlow sign is a strong independent finding of instability. Ignoring the dynamic assessment, which is the key to understanding the hip's function, is inappropriate. Waiting for the alpha angle to deteriorate means waiting for bony damage to occur, which is precisely what early treatment aims to prevent.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Morphology supersedes stability in early infancy; a normal alpha angle permits deferring all intervention until a pelvic radiograph at $6$ months to measure the acetabular index, at which point treatment decisions can be made.**\nThis statement reverses the established aetiological principle. Stability guides morphological development, not the other way around. A stable concentric reduction is necessary for the acetabulum to mature correctly. Deferring treatment of a proven unstable hip for several months is the antithesis of best practice and risks creating a more severe, harder-to-treat deformity. Furthermore, ultrasound, not radiography, is the imaging modality of choice for infants under $4-6$ months.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. A normal alpha angle in the presence of dynamic subluxation implies a nonreducing mechanical block by the labrum; immediate open reduction is indicated to prevent iatrogenic avascular necrosis.**\nThis option fundamentally misinterprets the clinical data. The problem states the hip has a \"smooth reduction\" on Ortolani maneuver and shows \"spontaneous reduction\" on ultrasound. This describes a reducible hip, not an irreducible one. A mechanical block (e.g., inverted labrum) would cause an irreducible dislocation. Open reduction is a highly invasive procedure reserved for cases where closed methods fail and is not indicated here. The reasoning regarding avascular necrosis is also flawed; open reduction carries its own significant risk of AVN.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5132544"}]}
