{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Understanding celiac disease begins with its strong genetic underpinnings, primarily linked to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system. This first exercise challenges you to translate knowledge of parental genotypes into a quantitative risk assessment for a child, using principles of Mendelian inheritance and the concept of relative risk. Mastering this calculation is key to providing accurate, evidence-based counseling to families about genetic predisposition to celiac disease [@problem_id:5113870].", "problem": "A 7-year-old asymptomatic child is being evaluated for future risk of celiac disease in the context of family human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing. The parents have been typed and both carry the human leukocyte antigen DQ2 (HLA-DQ2) haplotype. HLA typing clarifies that each parent is heterozygous for HLA-DQ2, meaning each carries exactly one HLA-DQ2 haplotype and one non-HLA-DQ2 haplotype. Assume Mendelian segregation of haplotypes with no recombination affecting inheritance at this locus, and independence between alleles from each parent.\n\nUse the following modeling assumptions:\n- The baseline probability of celiac disease in a non-carrier (no HLA-DQ2 haplotype) is $\\pi_{0} = 0.01$.\n- The relative risk for celiac disease in a carrier (at least one HLA-DQ2 haplotype) versus a non-carrier is $RR = 10$.\n- Current asymptomatic status does not modify the genotype-based risk.\n\nStarting from the definition of relative risk and the law of total probability, derive and compute the conditional probability that the child develops celiac disease given these parental genotypes. Express your final answer as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of genetics and epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively formulated. There are no violations of fundamental principles, missing data, or ambiguities that would render it unsolvable.\n\nThe objective is to compute the conditional probability that the child develops celiac disease, given the parental genotypes. Let $C$ be the event that the child develops celiac disease. The parental genotypes provide the basis for calculating the probability distribution of the child's genotype, upon which the risk of celiac disease depends.\n\nLet $D$ denote the high-risk human leukocyte antigen DQ2 (HLA-DQ2) haplotype and $d$ denote a non-HLA-DQ2 haplotype. The problem states that both parents are heterozygous for HLA-DQ2. Therefore, the genotype of each parent is $Dd$.\n\nWe first determine the probability distribution of the child's genotype using Mendelian principles. The cross is $Dd \\times Dd$. A Punnett square illustrates the possible genotypes for the offspring:\n\n| | Parent 1: $D$ | Parent 1: $d$ |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| **Parent 2: $D$** | $DD$ | $Dd$ |\n| **Parent 2: $d$** | $Dd$ | $dd$ |\n\nAssuming Mendelian segregation and independence, the probabilities of the child's possible genotypes are:\n-   Probability of being homozygous for the high-risk haplotype ($DD$): $P(G_{child}=DD) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n-   Probability of being heterozygous ($Dd$): $P(G_{child}=Dd) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n-   Probability of having no high-risk haplotype ($dd$): $P(G_{child}=dd) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThe problem defines risk in terms of being a \"carrier\" versus a \"non-carrier\".\n-   A non-carrier ($NC$) is an individual with genotype $dd$. The probability of the child being a non-carrier is $P(NC) = P(G_{child}=dd) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n-   A carrier ($CAR$) is an individual with at least one $D$ haplotype, corresponding to genotypes $DD$ or $Dd$. The probability of the child being a carrier is the complement of being a non-carrier: $P(CAR) = P(G_{child}=DD) + P(G_{child}=Dd) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nNext, we establish the conditional probabilities of developing celiac disease based on carrier status, using the provided parameters.\n-   The baseline probability of celiac disease in a non-carrier is given as $P(C | NC) = \\pi_{0} = 0.01$.\n-   The relative risk ($RR$) for a carrier versus a non-carrier is given as $RR=10$. The definition of relative risk is $RR = \\frac{P(C | CAR)}{P(C | NC)}$.\n-   Using this definition, we can find the probability of disease for a carrier:\n    $$P(C | CAR) = RR \\times P(C | NC) = RR \\times \\pi_{0}$$\n    Substituting the given values, we get:\n    $$P(C | CAR) = 10 \\times 0.01 = 0.1$$\n\nThe overall probability of the child developing celiac disease, $P(C)$, can be calculated using the law of total probability. We partition the sample space by the child's carrier status ({$CAR$, $NC$}):\n$$P(C) = P(C | CAR) \\cdot P(CAR) + P(C | NC) \\cdot P(NC)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the probabilities we have derived and been given:\n$$P(C) = (RR \\cdot \\pi_{0}) \\cdot P(CAR) + (\\pi_{0}) \\cdot P(NC)$$\n$$P(C) = (0.1) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) + (0.01) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)$$\n\nPerforming the arithmetic:\n$$P(C) = 0.1 \\times 0.75 + 0.01 \\times 0.25$$\n$$P(C) = 0.075 + 0.0025$$\n$$P(C) = 0.0775$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures. The exact calculated value is $0.0775$. This number has three significant figures (the digits $7$, $7$, and $5$). To express this result with four significant figures, a trailing zero must be added in the decimal part, indicating that the precision is known to that digit (i.e., the next digit is $0$).

It is free from subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, mathematically complete, and objectively framed. It is therefore deemed **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\nLet $D$ be the event that a subject has celiac disease and $D^c$ be the event that the subject does not have the disease. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Prevalence: $P(D)$. Consequently, the probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D)$.\n- Sensitivity: $S_e = P(T^+ | D) = 0.93$.\n- Specificity: $S_p = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.96$.\n\nFrom these, we can deduce two other conditional probabilities:\n- The probability of a negative test given disease (false negative rate) is $P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - S_e = 1 - 0.93 = 0.07$.\n- The probability of a positive test given no disease (false positive rate) is $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - S_p = 1 - 0.96 = 0.04$.\n\n**Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\nThe PPV is the probability of having the disease given a positive test result, i.e., $P(D | T^+)$. Using the definition of conditional probability (which can be derived from Bayes' theorem):\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}\n$$\nThe numerator can be expressed using the multiplication rule: $P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) = S_e P(D)$.\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test, found using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) = S_e P(D) + (1 - S_p)(1 - P(D))\n$$\nCombining these, the formula for PPV is:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{S_e P(D)}{S_e P(D) + (1 - S_p)(1 - P(D))}\n$$\n\n**Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\nThe NPV is the probability of not having the disease given a negative test result, i.e., $P(D^c | T^-)$. Using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(D^c \\cap T^-)}{P(T^-)}\n$$\nThe numerator is $P(D^c \\cap T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) = S_p (1 - P(D))$.\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test:\n$$\nP(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D) = S_p (1 - P(D)) + (1 - S_e) P(D)\n$$\nCombining these, the formula for NPV is:\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = \\frac{S_p (1 - P(D))}{S_p (1 - P(D)) + (1 - S_e) P(D)}\n$$\n\n### Calculations\nWe now apply these formulas for each given prevalence, rounding the final results to four significant figures.\n\n**Case 1: Prevalence $P(D) = 0.01$**\n- $1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$.\n- $\\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.93)(0.01)}{(0.93)(0.01) + (1 - 0.96)(0.99)} = \\frac{0.0093}{0.0093 + (0.04)(0.99)} = \\frac{0.0093}{0.0093 + 0.0396} = \\frac{0.0093}{0.0489} \\approx 0.190184... \\approx 0.1902$\n- $\\text{NPV} = \\frac{(0.96)(0.99)}{(0.96)(0.99) + (1 - 0.93)(0.01)} = \\frac{0.9504}{0.9504 + (0.07)(0.01)} = \\frac{0.9504}{0.9504 + 0.0007} = \\frac{0.9504}{0.9511} \\approx 0.999263... \\approx 0.9993$\n\n**Case 2: Prevalence $P(D) = 0.05$**\n- $1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$.\n- $\\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.93)(0.05)}{(0.93)(0.05) + (0.04)(0.95)} = \\frac{0.0465}{0.0465 + 0.0380} = \\frac{0.0465}{0.0845} \\approx 0.550295... \\approx 0.5503$\n- $\\text{NPV} = \\frac{(0.96)(0.95)}{(0.96)(0.95) + (0.07)(0.05)} = \\frac{0.912}{0.912 + 0.0035} = \\frac{0.912}{0.9155} \\approx 0.996176... \\approx 0.9962$\n\n**Case 3: Prevalence $P(D) = 0.10$**\n- $1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n- $\\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.93)(0.10)}{(0.93)(0.10) + (0.04)(0.90)} = \\frac{0.093}{0.093 + 0.036} = \\frac{0.093}{0.129} \\approx 0.720930... \\approx 0.7209$\n- $\\text{NPV} = \\frac{(0.96)(0.90)}{(0.96)(0.90) + (0.07)(0.10)} = \\frac{0.864}{0.864 + 0.007} = \\frac{0.864}{0.871} \\approx 0.991963... \\approx 0.9920$\n\nThe six computed values, arranged in the specified order, form the final answer.\n- PPV at $P(D)=0.01$: $0.1902$\n- NPV at $P(D)=0.01$: $0.9993$\n- PPV at $P(D)=0.05$: $0.5503$\n- NPV at $P(D)=0.05$: $0.9962$\n- PPV at $P(D)=0.10$: $0.7209$\n- NPV at $P(D)=0.10$: $0.9920$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.1902  0.9993  0.5503  0.9962  0.7209  0.9920\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5113808"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate task for a clinician is to synthesize all available data into a sound management plan, especially in cases that are not clear-cut.

The analysis can proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Management Strategy\n\nThe management for each child will be determined by applying the provided foundational principles to their specific clinical and laboratory data.\n\n**Analysis for the 7-year-old Boy:**\n\n1.  **Clinical Context and Pre-Test Probability:** The boy is highly symptomatic (chronic abdominal pain, bloating, poor weight gain) and has laboratory evidence of malabsorption (microcytic anemia). This places him in a high pre-test probability category for celiac disease.\n2.  **Serological Interpretation:** His tTG-IgA level is $65$ $\\mathrm{U/mL}$, which is $6.5 \\times \\text{ULN}$. According to Principle 3, since this value is elevated but **less than the $10\\times$ ULN threshold**, it \"require[s] histologic confirmation\" due to lower specificity. A non-biopsy diagnosis is not an option in this case, regardless of other serological markers like EMA-IgA.\n3.  **Application of Other Principles:**\n    *   Principle 4 mandates that any \"histologic confirmation\" via duodenal biopsies must be performed while he is consuming gluten. He is already doing so.\n    *   Principle 6, which suggests repeating serology, is explicitly for \"low pre-test probability scenarios with low-level tTG-IgA elevation.\" This does not apply to the boy, who is symptomatic and has a moderately high tTG-IgA level. Delaying diagnosis in a symptomatic, growing child is not appropriate.\n4.  **Conclusion for the boy:** The definitive next step is to obtain \"small-bowel mucosal damage\" evidence (Principle 1) through histologic confirmation (Principle 3). Therefore, he should proceed to an upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsies while maintaining his current gluten-containing diet.\n\n**Analysis for the 10-year-old Girl:**\n\n1.  **Clinical Context and Pre-Test Probability:** The girl is asymptomatic and is being screened because she is a first-degree relative of a person with celiac disease. Her pre-test probability is elevated compared to the general population but is lower than that of a symptomatic child.\n2.  **Serological Interpretation:** Her tTG-IgA is $18$ $\\mathrm{U/mL}$, which is a low-level elevation at $1.8 \\times \\text{ULN}$. Furthermore, her EMA-IgA, a more specific antibody test (Principle 5), is negative. The combination of being asymptomatic, having a low-level tTG-IgA, and a negative EMA-IgA significantly lowers the immediate probability of active celiac disease.\n3.  **Application of Other Principles:**\n    *   Principle 6 is directly applicable here. This is a \"low-level tTG-IgA elevation\" scenario. The principle states that in such cases, it is appropriate to \"repeat serology at an appropriate interval while on gluten [to] clarify persistence versus transient false positivity and guide the need for endoscopy.\" This strategy avoids an unnecessary invasive procedure if the serology was a transient finding. A standard clinical interval for this re-evaluation is $3$ to $6$ months.\n    *   Principle 4 is relevant in that she must continue her gluten intake for any future testing (serologic or histologic) to be valid.\n4.  **Conclusion for the girl:** The most appropriate and evidence-based management is to continue her gluten-containing diet and repeat serology (both tTG-IgA and EMA-IgA) in $3$ to $6$ months to assess for any change. An endoscopy would be deferred and only considered if titers rise, EMA-IgA becomes positive, or she develops symptoms.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A. For the symptomatic $7$-year-old boy, initiate a gluten-free diet immediately without endoscopy and plan to repeat serology in $12$ months; for the asymptomatic $10$-year-old girl, no further work-up is needed if EMA-IgA is negative.**\n    *   Boy: This violates Principle 3, which requires histologic confirmation for tTG-IgA $ 10 \\times \\text{ULN}$. Starting a gluten-free diet without a biopsy is incorrect and prevents a definitive diagnosis (violates Principle 4 for future diagnosis).\n    *   Girl: This is incorrect. A positive tTG-IgA in a high-risk individual warrants follow-up, as specified in Principle 6. Ignoring it is inappropriate.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B. For the symptomatic $7$-year-old boy, arrange upper endoscopy with duodenal biopsies while he continues gluten; consider adding EMA-IgA for completeness but do not delay biopsy. For the asymptomatic $10$-year-old girl, repeat serology (tTG-IgA and EMA-IgA) in $3$ to $6$ months while maintaining gluten, deferring biopsy unless titers rise, EMA-IgA becomes positive, or symptoms develop.**\n    *   Boy: This plan is perfectly aligned with the derivation. It correctly identifies the need for biopsy based on a tTG-IgA level $ 10 \\times \\text{ULN}$ in a symptomatic patient and respects the need for a gluten-containing diet (Principle 4).\n    *   Girl: This plan is also perfectly aligned with the derivation. It applies the strategy of watchful waiting with repeat serology for a low-level tTG-IgA in an asymptomatic, lower-probability setting (Principle 6), while ensuring the prerequisite of continued gluten intake (Principle 4).\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **C. For the symptomatic $7$-year-old boy, obtain EMA-IgA and if positive, diagnose celiac disease without biopsy; for the asymptomatic $10$-year-old girl, reduce gluten intake and repeat serology in $2$ weeks; if titers decrease, no further evaluation is required.**\n    *   Boy: This plan is incorrect. It violates Principle 3. A non-biopsy diagnosis requires tTG-IgA $\\ge 10 \\times \\text{ULN}$. The boy's level is $6.5 \\times \\text{ULN}$, so a biopsy is necessary regardless of the EMA-IgA result.\n    *   Girl: This plan is incorrect. Reducing gluten intake would make serology uninterpretable (violates Principle 4). A $2$-week interval is too short for meaningful serological change.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. For the symptomatic $7$-year-old boy, repeat tTG-IgA in $6$ months and defer endoscopy because the titer is $10 \\times$ ULN; for the asymptomatic $10$-year-old girl, perform endoscopy now despite low titer and negative EMA-IgA to avoid missing subclinical disease.**\n    *   Boy: This is an incorrect and clinically harmful delay. The boy is symptomatic with poor weight gain. Principle 6 (repeating serology) is for low-probability cases, which he is not. Principle 3 mandates histologic confirmation, not delay.\n    *   Girl: This is an overly aggressive approach. It ignores the guidance of Principle 6, which offers a non-invasive path to clarify the meaning of her low-level seropositivity. Proceeding directly to an invasive procedure is not justified by the weak evidence.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5113886"}]}
