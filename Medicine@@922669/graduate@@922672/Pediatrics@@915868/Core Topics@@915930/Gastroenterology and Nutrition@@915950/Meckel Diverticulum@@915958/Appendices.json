It is scientifically grounded in the principles of medical diagnostics and probability theory, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nWe are tasked with calculating the post-test probability of a patient having Meckel diverticulum given a positive test result, denoted as $P(D \\mid T)$. The derivation must start from fundamental definitions.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the child has Meckel diverticulum, and let $T$ be the event that the Technetium-99m scintigraphy (Meckel scan) is positive. Consequently, $D^c$ denotes the absence of Meckel diverticulum, and $T^c$ denotes a negative test result.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are:\n1.  The pretest probability of Meckel diverticulum: $P(D) = 0.30$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present: $P(T \\mid D) = 0.85$.\n3.  The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent: $P(T^c \\mid D^c) = 0.95$.\n\nOur objective is to find the post-test probability, $P(D \\mid T)$.\n\nAccording to the fundamental definition of conditional probability, the post-test probability is given by:\n$$\nP(D \\mid T) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(T)}\n$$\nwhere $P(D \\cap T)$ is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive, and $P(T)$ is the total probability of testing positive.\n\nWe will expand the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\nFor the numerator, we use the definition of conditional probability again:\n$P(T \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(D)}$.\nRearranging this gives an expression for the joint probability:\n$$\nP(D \\cap T) = P(T \\mid D) P(D)\n$$\nBoth terms on the right-hand side, the sensitivity and the pretest probability, are given.\n\nFor the denominator, $P(T)$, we apply the law of total probability. A positive test result can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: the patient has the disease and tests positive ($D \\cap T$), or the patient does not have the disease and tests positive ($D^c \\cap T$). Therefore, the total probability of a positive test is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n$$\nP(T) = P(D \\cap T) + P(D^c \\cap T)\n$$\nWe already have an expression for the first term, $P(D \\cap T) = P(T \\mid D) P(D)$. Similarly, for the second term, we can write:\n$$\nP(D^c \\cap T) = P(T \\mid D^c) P(D^c)\n$$\nHere, $P(D^c)$ is the probability of not having the disease, which is complementary to $P(D)$:\n$$\nP(D^c) = 1 - P(D)\n$$\nAnd $P(T \\mid D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given that the disease is absent (the false positive rate). This is complementary to the specificity, $P(T^c \\mid D^c)$, since a person without the disease can either test positive or negative.\n$$\nP(T \\mid D^c) + P(T^c \\mid D^c) = 1\n$$\nTherefore, the false positive rate is:\n$$\nP(T \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(T^c \\mid D^c)\n$$\nSubstituting these expansions back into the expression for $P(T)$:\n$$\nP(T) = P(T \\mid D) P(D) + (1 - P(T^c \\mid D^c)) (1 - P(D))\n$$\nNow, we can assemble the complete expression for $P(D \\mid T)$, which is Bayes' theorem for this context:\n$$\nP(D \\mid T) = \\frac{P(T \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T \\mid D) P(D) + P(T \\mid D^c) P(D^c)}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived relations for $P(T \\mid D^c)$ and $P(D^c)$:\n$$\nP(D \\mid T) = \\frac{P(T \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T \\mid D) P(D) + (1 - P(T^c \\mid D^c)) (1 - P(D))}\n$$\nThis is the explicit expression for the post-test probability derived from fundamental principles.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression using the given numerical values:\n$P(D) = 0.30$\n$P(T \\mid D) = 0.85$\n$P(T^c \\mid D^c) = 0.95$\n\nFirst, calculate the complementary probabilities:\n$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$\n$P(T \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(T^c \\mid D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$\n\nNow, substitute all values into the derived formula:\n$$\nP(D \\mid T) = \\frac{(0.85) \\times (0.30)}{(0.85) \\times (0.30) + (0.05) \\times (0.70)}\n$$\nCalculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\nNumerator: $0.85 \\times 0.30 = 0.255$\nDenominator, first term: $0.85 \\times 0.30 = 0.255$\nDenominator, second term: $0.05 \\times 0.70 = 0.035$\nSo, the expression becomes:\n$$\nP(D \\mid T) = \\frac{0.255}{0.255 + 0.035} = \\frac{0.255}{0.290}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nP(D \\mid T) = 0.8793103448...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nP(D \\mid T) \\approx 0.8793\n$$\nThus, the post-test probability that the child has a Meckel diverticulum after a positive scan is $0.8793$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.8793}\n$$", "id": "5169263"}, {"introduction": "Effective management of a bleeding Meckel diverticulum often begins with stabilizing the patient's hemodynamics and oxygen-carrying capacity.

We can express this relationship as:\n$$\n\\Delta Hb = k \\cdot v\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nThe problem provides a specific instance of this rule, which we can use to determine the constant $k$ or to solve the problem by ratio.

The diagnostic modalities are standard in clinical practice. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to arrive at a logical answer based on established medical principles and clinical algorithms. No scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe selection of the first diagnostic test is dictated by two primary factors: the patient's hemodynamic stability and the most probable diagnosis based on the clinical presentation.\n\n**Analysis for Patient 1**\n\nThis $3$-year-old patient is in hypovolemic shock due to a massive, active gastrointestinal bleed. The immediate priority is resuscitation, followed by rapid localization of the bleeding source to enable targeted intervention (surgical resection or angiographic embolization).\n\n*   **Colonoscopy**: This is a poor first choice. The patient's instability contraindicates the time required for a proper bowel preparation, which is essential for adequate visualization. Performing an emergent, unprepared colonoscopy in the setting of massive hemorrhage is fraught with difficulty; the lumen would be filled with blood and clots, making it nearly impossible to identify a specific bleeding point. The procedure itself could also exacerbate instability.\n*   **Meckel Scan (Technetium-99m pertechnetate)**: While a bleeding Meckel diverticulum is a very likely cause in this age group with painless bleeding, the Meckel scan is not the optimal first test in this specific scenario of extreme instability. The scan identifies ectopic gastric mucosa, which is the underlying cause, but it does not directly visualize active extravasation with the same precision and rapidity as angiography. Its primary utility is in stable patients where Meckel diverticulum is suspected. In an unstable patient, the primary goal is rapid localization of the active bleeding site, wherever it may be.\n*   **CT Angiography (CTA)**: This is the most appropriate first diagnostic test. CTA is a rapid, non-invasive imaging modality that can survey the entire abdomen and pelvis. Its ability to detect bleeding depends on the rate of active hemorrhage, with a typical threshold of $>0.5\\ \\mathrm{mL/min}$. Given this patient's brisk hematochezia and hemodynamic collapse, the bleeding rate is certainly high enough for detection. CTA can precisely localize the site of active contrast extravasation, whether from a Meckel diverticulum, an arteriovenous malformation, or another source, thereby guiding immediate life-saving surgery or interventional radiology.\n\nTherefore, the correct first test for Patient $1$ is **CT angiography**.\n\n**Analysis for Patient 2**\n\nThis $5$-year-old patient is hemodynamically stable and has a classic history for a Meckel diverticulum: intermittent, painless, and occasionally significant hematochezia. The diagnostic goal is to confirm this high-probability diagnosis.\n\n*   **CT Angiography**: This is inappropriate. The patient is stable and likely not bleeding at a rate detectable by CTA at the moment of scanning. This test confers a significant radiation dose and requires intravenous contrast, making it unjustifiable as a first-line test for a non-emergent condition in a stable child.\n*   **Colonoscopy**: This test is unable to visualize a Meckel diverticulum, which is located in the distal ileum (small intestine). While it could rule out other less likely causes in the colon (e.g., polyps), it does not address the primary clinical suspicion. It would be a reasonable second-line test if the initial, more specific workup were negative.\n*   **Meckel Scan (Technetium-99m pertechnetate)**: This is the definitive first-line test. The scan uses technetium-99m pertechnetate, which is taken up by gastric mucosal cells. A bleeding Meckel diverticulum typically contains ectopic gastric mucosa, which ulcerates the adjacent ileum, causing hemorrhage. The scan is highly specific for this condition and has good sensitivity (approximately $85\\%$) in the pediatric population. Crucially, it does not require active bleeding for diagnosis. Given the stable patient and the classic history, this is the most logical, highest-yield, and most appropriate initial investigation.\n\nTherefore, the correct first test for Patient $2$ is a **Meckel scan**.\n\n**Analysis for Patient 3**\n\nThis $14$-year-old adolescent is hemodynamically stable with subacute symptoms: low-volume bleeding, crampy pain, weight loss, and localized tenderness. This constellation of findings is highly suggestive of a mucosal inflammatory process within the colon, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rather than a vascular lesion or a Meckel diverticulum (which typically presents with painless bleeding).\n\n*   **CT Angiography**: This is not indicated. The bleeding is low-volume and likely not rapid enough to be detected. The clinical picture does not suggest an acute vascular catastrophe.\n*   **Meckel Scan**: This is also not indicated. The presence of pain, weight loss, and the adolescent age group make a Meckel diverticulum a much less likely diagnosis compared to IBD.\n*   **Colonoscopy**: This is the most appropriate first test. The patient is stable, allowing for a safe and effective bowel preparation. Colonoscopy provides direct visualization of the entire colonic mucosa, allowing for the identification of inflammation, ulcerations, polyps, or other lesions. Most importantly, it allows for tissue biopsy, which is essential for a definitive histopathological diagnosis of conditions like ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Given the symptoms, colonoscopy is the gold standard and offers the highest diagnostic yield.\n\nTherefore, the correct first test for Patient $3$ is **Colonoscopy**.\n\n### Summary and Option Evaluation\n\n*   Patient 1: **CT angiography** (unstable, massive active bleeding needing rapid localization).\n*   Patient 2: **Meckel scan** (stable, classic history for Meckel diverticulum).\n*   Patient 3: **Colonoscopy** (stable, symptoms suggest colonic mucosal disease like IBD).\n\nThe correct sequence of tests is: CT angiography, Meckel scan, Colonoscopy.\n\n*   **A. CT angiography; Meckel scan; Colonoscopy**: This option correctly lists the first test for Patient $1$ as CT angiography, for Patient $2$ as Meckel scan, and for Patient $3$ as Colonoscopy. This matches our derived conclusion. **Correct**.\n*   **B. Colonoscopy; CT angiography; Meckel scan**: This option is incorrect. Colonoscopy is wrong for Patient $1$, CT angiography is wrong for Patient $2$, and Meckel scan is wrong for Patient $3$. **Incorrect**.\n*   **C.
