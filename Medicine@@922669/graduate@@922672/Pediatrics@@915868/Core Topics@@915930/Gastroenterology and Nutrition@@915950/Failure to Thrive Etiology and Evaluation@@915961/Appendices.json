This practice moves beyond simple plotting on a growth chart to a more rigorous quantitative approach. By applying least-squares linear regression to a series of weights, you will calculate the precise average daily gain and compare it against age-specific norms, a critical skill for distinguishing pathological growth faltering from normal physiological variations like catch-down growth [@problem_id:5142788].", "problem": "A 5-month-old female infant is evaluated for growth faltering. Serial weights were obtained at three time points over 6 weeks: at $t_0 = 0$ days, the weight was $W_0 = 6.10\\,\\mathrm{kg}$; at $t_1 = 21$ days, the weight was $W_1 = 6.34\\,\\mathrm{kg}$; and at $t_2 = 42$ days, the weight was $W_2 = 6.49\\,\\mathrm{kg}$. For interpretation with World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards, assume the Lambda Mu Sigma (LMS) method parameters for female weight-for-age at $5.0$ months are $L_0 = -0.1$, $M_0 = 7.10\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $S_0 = 0.092$, and at $6.5$ months are $L_2 = -0.1$, $M_2 = 7.60\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $S_2 = 0.090$.

The validation will determine if the pattern is more consistent with catch-down growth or Failure to Thrive (FTT).\n\nFirst, the average daily weight gain, which is the weight velocity $v = \\frac{dW}{dt}$, is estimated by performing a least-squares linear regression on the provided weight ($W$) versus time ($t$) data. The model for the regression line is $W(t) = a + bt$, where the slope $b$ represents the average daily weight gain.\n\nThe given data points $(t_i, W_i)$ are:\n- $(t_0, W_0) = (0\\,\\mathrm{days}, 6.10\\,\\mathrm{kg})$\n- $(t_1, W_1) = (21\\,\\mathrm{days}, 6.34\\,\\mathrm{kg})$\n- $(t_2, W_2) = (42\\,\\mathrm{days}, 6.49\\,\\mathrm{kg})$\n\nFor a set of $n$ data points $(t_i, W_i)$, the slope $b$ of the least-squares regression line is given by the formula:\n$$b = \\frac{n \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} t_i W_i \\right) - \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} t_i \\right) \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} W_i \\right)}{n \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} t_i^2 \\right) - \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} t_i \\right)^2}$$\nIn this case, $n=3$. We compute the required sums:\n- $\\sum t_i = t_0 + t_1 + t_2 = 0 + 21 + 42 = 63$\n- $\\sum W_i = W_0 + W_1 + W_2 = 6.10 + 6.34 + 6.49 = 18.93$\n- $\\sum t_i^2 = t_0^2 + t_1^2 + t_2^2 = 0^2 + 21^2 + 42^2 = 0 + 441 + 1764 = 2205$\n- $\\sum t_i W_i = (t_0 W_0) + (t_1 W_1) + (t_2 W_2) = (0)(6.10) + (21)(6.34) + (42)(6.49) = 0 + 133.14 + 272.58 = 405.72$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the slope $b$:\n$$b = \\frac{3(405.72) - (63)(18.93)}{3(2205) - (63)^2} = \\frac{1217.16 - 1192.59}{6615 - 3969} = \\frac{24.57}{2646}$$\n$$b \\approx 0.0092857\\,\\mathrm{kg/day}$$\nThe problem asks for the average daily gain in grams per day ($\\mathrm{g/day}$).

The infant's weight gain is substantially below the expected norm and outside the typical range of 15–20 g/day.\n\nWe then evaluate the change in the weight-for-age $z$-score. The $z$-score is calculated using the LMS formula $z = \\frac{(x/M)^{L} - 1}{L S}$.\n\nAt $t_0 = 0$ (age $5.0$ months):\n- Weight $W_0 = 6.10\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- LMS parameters: $L_0 = -0.1$, $M_0 = 7.10\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $S_0 = 0.092$.\n$$z_0 = \\frac{(6.10/7.10)^{-0.1} - 1}{(-0.1)(0.092)} = \\frac{(0.85915...)^{-0.1} - 1}{-0.0092} = \\frac{1.01530 - 1}{-0.0092} \\approx -1.66$$\n\nAt $t_2 = 42$ days (age approximately $6.5$ months):\n- Weight $W_2 = 6.49\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- LMS parameters: $L_2 = -0.1$, $M_2 = 7.60\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $S_2 = 0.090$.\n$$z_2 = \\frac{(6.49/7.60)^{-0.1} - 1}{(-0.1)(0.090)} = \\frac{(0.85394...)^{-0.1} - 1}{-0.009} = \\frac{1.01584 - 1}{-0.009} \\approx -1.76$$\n\nThe change in $z$-score over the $6$-week period is $\\Delta z = z_2 - z_0 \\approx -1.76 - (-1.66) = -0.1$. This is a slight downward trend but does not meet the specified example criterion for a substantial decline (a drop greater than $1$).\n\nAccording to the problem's definitions, Failure to Thrive (FTT) is characterized by \"weight velocity persistently below age-specific norms and/or a substantial decline in weight-for-age trajectory\". Catch-down growth is characterized by a \"weight velocity that remains within age-appropriate norms\".\nThe calculated velocity ($ \\approx 9.29\\,\\mathrm{g/day}$) is well below the norm of $16\\,\\mathrm{g/day}$. Therefore, the first condition for FTT is met. Since the velocity is not within the normal range, the pattern is inconsistent with catch-down growth.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe standardized score (z-score) for a given measurement $W$ is defined by the WHO LMS method. The general formula is:\n$$z = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{W}{M}\\right)^L - 1}{L S}$$\nwhere $M$ is the median, $L$ is the Box-Cox power, and $S$ is the generalized coefficient of variation. The problem specifies that $L=0$. In the limit as $L \\to 0$, the expression $\\frac{x^L - 1}{L}$ converges to $\\ln(x)$. Therefore, for the special case where $L=0$, the z-score formula simplifies to:\n$$z = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{W}{M}\\right)}{S}$$\nTo solve for the weight $W$ given a z-score $z$, we rearrange this equation:\n$$zS = \\ln\\left(\\frac{W}{M}\\right)$$\n$$\\exp(zS) = \\frac{W}{M}$$\n$$W = M \\exp(zS)$$\nThis formula will be used to calculate the infant's baseline and target weights.\n\nFirst, we calculate the actual baseline weight, $W_0$, corresponding to the initial z-score $z_0 = -2.5$.
