This is the product of the dosage rate and the child's mass.\n$$D_{total} = R_d \\times M$$\n$$D_{total} = (30\\,\\text{mg}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}\\,\\text{day}^{-1}) \\times (18.2\\,\\text{kg}) = 546\\,\\text{mg}\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$$\n\nThe total daily dose is to be divided into administrations every $8$ hours. The number of doses per day, $n$, is calculated by dividing the total hours in a day ($24$) by the dosing interval in hours ($8$).\n$$n = \\frac{24\\,\\text{hours}/\\text{day}}{8\\,\\text{hours}/\\text{dose}} = 3\\,\\text{doses}/\\text{day}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the mass of clindamycin required for a single dose, $D_{single}$. This is the total daily dose divided by the number of doses per day.\n$$D_{single} = \\frac{D_{total}}{n}$$\n$$D_{single} = \\frac{546\\,\\text{mg}}{3} = 182\\,\\text{mg}$$\n\nThe pharmacy supplies a suspension with a concentration, $C$, of $75\\,\\text{mg}$ per $5\\,\\text{mL}$. We can express this concentration in units of $\\text{mg}\\,\\text{mL}^{-1}$.\n$$C = \\frac{75\\,\\text{mg}}{5\\,\\text{mL}} = 15\\,\\text{mg}\\,\\text{mL}^{-1}$$\n\nFinally, to find the volume of suspension for a single dose, $V_{single}$, we use the definition of concentration, $C = \\frac{\\text{mass}}{\\text{volume}}$, and rearrange it to solve for volume: $V = \\frac{\\text{mass}}{C}$. We divide the mass of a single dose, $D_{single}$, by the concentration, $C$.\n$$V_{single} = \\frac{D_{single}}{C}$$\n$$V_{single} = \\frac{182\\,\\text{mg}}{15\\,\\text{mg}\\,\\text{mL}^{-1}} = \\frac{182}{15}\\,\\text{mL}$$\n\nPerforming the division gives a numerical value:\n$$V_{single} \\approx 12.1333...\\,\\text{mL}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $1$, $2$, and $1$. The fourth digit is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$V_{single} \\approx 12.1\\,\\text{mL}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12.1}$$", "id": "5109350"}, {"introduction": "Effective clinical practice hinges on the ability to synthesize information from multiple sources into a coherent diagnosis.

Gram-positive bacteria retain crystal violet due to a thick peptidoglycan cell wall.\n    2. Coccal arrangement (clusters vs. chains) reflects the plane(s) of cell division.\n    3. Involvement of superficial dermal lymphatics produces a raised, sharply demarcated plaque.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is evaluated for scientific soundness, clarity, and completeness.\n\n- **Scientific Groundedness:** The clinical scenario presented is a classic, textbook description of erysipelas. The patient's age group, the acute onset with systemic symptoms (fever, malaise), the specific features of the skin lesion (bright-red, sharply demarcated, raised plaque on the face), and the absence of purulence are all characteristic of this diagnosis. The laboratory findings of neutrophilic leukocytosis are consistent with an acute bacterial infection. The microbiological data (Gram-positive cocci in chains, catalase-negative, beta-hemolytic) provide a coherent and definitive profile for *Streptococcus pyogenes* (Group A Streptococcus), the most common causative agent of erysipelas. The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of pediatrics, dermatology, and microbiology.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides sufficient, consistent, and relevant data to deduce a single most likely pathogen and clinical diagnosis. The question asks for the combination of pathogen and phenotype that is most consistent with the findings, which is a standard task in clinical reasoning.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is described using precise, objective clinical terminology and quantitative laboratory values. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, internally consistent, well-posed, and objective. It presents a classic clinical case that can be solved by applying fundamental principles of microbiology and clinical medicine.\n**Verdict: The problem is valid.**\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe task is to deduce the most likely pathogen and the associated clinical phenotype based on the provided data and first principles.\n\n1.  **Pathogen Identification:**\n    - The Gram stain shows \"Gram-positive cocci\". This narrows the common etiologic agents of skin infections to the genera *Staphylococcus* and *Streptococcus*.\n    - The arrangement is \"predominantly in chains\". As per the provided principle, this morphology results from cell division in a single plane and is characteristic of *Streptococcus* species. *Staphylococcus* species divide in multiple planes, forming grape-like clusters.\n    - The \"catalase test is negative\". This is a key biochemical test used to differentiate these two genera. Staphylococci are catalase-positive (they produce the enzyme catalase, which breaks down hydrogen peroxide), whereas Streptococci are catalase-negative. This finding confirms the organism is a *Streptococcus*.\n    - The culture shows \"beta-hemolytic colonies on blood agar\". Beta-hemolysis refers to the complete lysis of red blood cells surrounding the bacterial colony. The primary beta-hemolytic streptococci relevant in human disease are *Streptococcus pyogenes* (Group A Streptococcus, GAS) and *Streptococcus agalactiae* (Group B Streptococcus, GBS).\n    - Given the patient is a healthy $6$-year-old child and the infection is on the face, *S. pyogenes* is the overwhelmingly more probable pathogen compared to *S. agalactiae*, which typically causes disease in neonates, pregnant women, or immunocompromised adults. Therefore, the pathogen is most likely *Streptococcus pyogenes*.\n\n2.  **Clinical Phenotype Identification:**\n    - The lesion is described as a \"bright-red, tender facial plaque\" with a \"raised, sharply demarcated leading edge\".\n    - The problem explicitly states that \"involvement of the superficial dermal lymphatics produces a raised, sharply demarcated plaque\".\n    - This clinical picture defines **erysipelas**, which is a specific form of superficial cellulitis affecting the upper dermis and superficial lymphatics. The sharp demarcation is the key feature distinguishing it from deeper cellulitis, which involves the lower dermis and subcutaneous fat and has ill-defined borders.\n    - The rapid onset, associated fever, and systemic symptoms are also classic for erysipelas, which is most frequently caused by *S. pyogenes*. The absence of fluctuance or purulence further supports this diagnosis, as erysipelas is a non-purulent infection.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:** The patient has erysipelas caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes* (Group A Streptococcus).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Staphylococcus aureus causing a deep, nonpurulent cellulitis with ill-defined borders and prominent lymphangitic streaking; Gram-positive cocci in chains on Gram stain**\n- **Pathogen:** The statement attributes the infection to *Staphylococcus aureus* but then describes the Gram stain as \"cocci in chains\". This is a direct contradiction; *S. aureus* grows in clusters. Furthermore, the catalase test was negative, ruling out *Staphylococcus*.\n- **Phenotype:** \"deep... cellulitis with ill-defined borders\" conflicts with the physical exam finding of a superficial plaque with \"sharply demarcated\" borders. While *S. aureus* can cause nonpurulent cellulitis, it is more often associated with purulent infections (abscesses, furuncles).\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option contains multiple self-contradictions and inconsistencies with the provided clinical and microbiological data.\n\n**B. Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) causing erysipelas due to superficial dermal lymphatic involvement with raised, sharply demarcated margins; risk includes post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis after skin infection but not acute rheumatic fever**\n- **Pathogen and Phenotype:** This correctly identifies the pathogen as *Streptococcus pyogenes* and the disease as erysipelas, with a correct explanation for the clinical appearance (\"superficial dermal lymphatic involvement with raised, sharply demarcated margins\"). This perfectly aligns with our derivation.\n- **Sequelae:** The information regarding post-streptococcal sequelae is medically accurate. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) can follow both streptococcal pharyngitis and streptococcal skin infections (pyoderma, including erysipelas and impetigo). In contrast, acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a recognized complication of streptococcal pharyngitis only and is not associated with skin infections.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. Every component of this option is consistent with the problem statement and established medical facts.\n\n**C. Staphylococcus aureus causing non-bullous impetigo with honey-colored crusts localized to the nares and perioral area; coagulase test negative**\n- **Pathogen:** This suggests *Staphylococcus aureus* but states the coagulase test is negative. *S. aureus* is by definition coagulase-positive. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are typically less virulent and are not the cause of this clinical picture. This part is internally contradictory and also inconsistent with the catalase-negative result from the problem.\n- **Phenotype:** This suggests non-bullous impetigo. Impetigo is a more superficial infection characterized by vesicles that rupture to form honey-colored crusts. The patient presents with a deep, indurated plaque without crusting, and significant systemic toxicity (high fever), which is not typical for localized impetigo.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The proposed pathogen, its biochemical characteristic, and the clinical diagnosis are all inconsistent with the case presentation.\n\n**D. Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus) causing periorbital cellulitis in a school-aged child after sinusitis with prominent purulence and abscess formation**\n- **Pathogen:** This suggests *Streptococcus agalactiae* (GBS). While GBS is a beta-hemolytic streptococcus, it is an unlikely cause of facial erysipelas in a healthy $6$-year-old. *S. pyogenes* is far more common.\n- **Phenotype:** This describes periorbital cellulitis, but the lesion is on the malar region (cheek). It also describes \"prominent purulence and abscess formation,\" which is directly contradicted by the physical exam finding of \"no fluctuance and no visible purulent drainage\". Erysipelas is a non-purulent infection.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The proposed pathogen is less likely, and the description of the location and character of the infection is factually wrong based on the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5109273"}, {"introduction": "Clinical decision-making often involves updating our assessment of a patient's condition as new information becomes available.

Let $E_1^c$ be the event of a negative test.\n$P(E_1^c \\mid N) = 0.85$\nFrom this, we can find the probability of a false positive, which is the probability of a positive test given MRSA is not present:\n$P(E_1 \\mid N) = 1 - P(E_1^c \\mid N) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$\n\nThe conditional probabilities for early beta-lactam failure are:\n$P(E_2 \\mid M) = 0.65$\n$P(E_2 \\mid N) = 0.20$\n\nThe patient in question presents with both a positive PCR test ($E_1$) and early beta-lactam failure ($E_2$).
