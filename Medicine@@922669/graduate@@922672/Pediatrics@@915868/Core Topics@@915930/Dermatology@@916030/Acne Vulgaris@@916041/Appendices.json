[@problem_id:5091709]", "problem": "A $15$-year-old pediatric patient presents with acne vulgaris involving facial and truncal regions. The Global Acne Grading System (GAGS) is a well-tested clinical scoring framework that aggregates region-wise severity based on lesion type and region-specific weighting, reflecting sebaceous gland density and clinical impact. Use the following foundational definitions and facts to derive and compute the total GAGS score from first principles:\n\n- Lesion severity hierarchy is defined by consensus clinical morphology: comedones (noninflammatory) are less severe than papules (inflammatory), which are less severe than pustules (purulent inflammatory), which are less severe than nodules (deep inflammatory). This establishes a strictly ordered set: comedones $<$ papules $<$ pustules $<$ nodules.\n- For each region, the region grade $g$ is determined by the most severe lesion type present in that region under the following rule: $g=0$ if no lesions are present; $g=1$ if comedones are present and no papules, pustules, or nodules are present; $g=2$ if papules are present (regardless of comedones); $g=3$ if pustules are present (regardless of papules or comedones); and $g=4$ if nodules are present (regardless of any other lesions).\n- Each region has a fixed weighting factor $w$ reflecting its clinical contribution: forehead $w_{\\text{forehead}}=2$, right cheek $w_{\\text{right cheek}}=2$, left cheek $w_{\\text{left cheek}}=2$, nose $w_{\\text{nose}}=1$, chin $w_{\\text{chin}}=1$, and chest/upper back $w_{\\text{chest/back}}=3$.\n- The total GAGS score $S$ is the sum of the products of region weights and region grades across all regions.\n\nClassify the severity band using the following well-tested bands: mild if $1 \\leq S \\leq 18$, moderate if $19 \\leq S \\leq 30$, severe if $31 \\leq S \\leq 38$, and very severe if $S \\geq 39$.\n\nThe observed lesion counts are given below as the number of comedones ($C$), papules ($P$), pustules ($Pu$), and nodules ($N$) in each region:\n\n- Forehead: $C=18$, $P=6$, $Pu=0$, $N=0$.\n- Right cheek: $C=22$, $P=3$, $Pu=2$, $N=0$.\n- Left cheek: $C=16$, $P=0$, $Pu=0$, $N=0$.\n- Nose: $C=8$, $P=2$, $Pu=1$, $N=0$.\n- Chin: $C=5$, $P=0$, $Pu=0$, $N=0$.\n- Chest/upper back: $C=10$, $P=7$, $Pu=4$, $N=1$.\n\nStarting from the definitions above, derive the region grades $g$ from the lesion hierarchy and presence rules, then compute the total GAGS score $S$ from the weighted sum across regions, and determine the severity band. Express the final answer as the exact integer value of $S$; no rounding is required and no units should be included in the final answer box. The severity band classification should be stated in your reasoning but not included in the final answer box.", "solution": "The user has requested the computation of a Global Acne Grading System (GAGS) score for a pediatric patient. I will first validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following data and definitions:\n- **Patient Age:** $15$ years.\n- **Diagnosis:** Acne vulgaris.\n- **Affected Areas:** Facial and truncal regions.\n- **Scoring System:** Global Acne Grading System (GAGS).\n- **Lesion Hierarchy:** Comedones $<$ Papules $<$ Pustules $<$ Nodules.\n- **Region Grade ($g$) Rules:**\n  - $g=0$: No lesions.\n  - $g=1$: Comedones only.\n  - $g=2$: Papules present (with or without less severe lesions).\n  - $g=3$: Pustules present (with or without less severe lesions).\n  - $g=4$: Nodules present (with or without less severe lesions).\n- **Region Weighting Factors ($w$):**\n  - Forehead: $w_{\\text{forehead}}=2$.\n  - Right cheek: $w_{\\text{right cheek}}=2$.\n  - Left cheek: $w_{\\text{left cheek}}=2$.\n  - Nose: $w_{\\text{nose}}=1$.\n  - Chin: $w_{\\text{chin}}=1$.\n  - Chest/upper back: $w_{\\text{chest/back}}=3$.\n- **Total Score Formula:** The total GAGS score $S$ is the sum of the products of region weights and region grades, $S = \\sum w_i g_i$.\n- **Severity Bands:**\n  - Mild: $1 \\leq S \\leq 18$.\n  - Moderate: $19 \\leq S \\leq 30$.\n  - Severe: $31 \\leq S \\leq 38$.\n  - Very severe: $S \\geq 39$.\n- **Observed Lesion Counts ($C$, $P$, $Pu$, $N$):**\n  - Forehead: $C=18$, $P=6$, $Pu=0$, $N=0$.\n  - Right cheek: $C=22$, $P=3$, $Pu=2$, $N=0$.\n  - Left cheek: $C=16$, $P=0$, $Pu=0$, $N=0$.\n  - Nose: $C=8$, $P=2$, $Pu=1$, $N=0$.\n  - Chin: $C=5$, $P=0$, $Pu=0$, $N=0$.\n  - Chest/upper back: $C=10$, $P=7$, $Pu=4$, $N=1$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained.\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The GAGS is a recognized and validated clinical scoring system used in dermatology. The problem accurately describes its structure and application. It is founded on established clinical practice.\n- **Well-Posed:** All rules for determining region grades and the total score are explicitly defined. All necessary data (lesion counts, weights) are provided. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using quantitative measures and formal rules, free of subjective language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides a complete set of data and rules with no internal contradictions. It is not missing any essential information.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the total GAGS score, $S$, based on the provided lesion counts for a $15$-year-old patient. The total score is defined as the sum of the scores for each of the six specified anatomical regions. The score for each region is the product of its grade, $g$, and its weighting factor, $w$. The total score is thus:\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} w_i g_i$$\nThe grade $g$ for each region is determined by the most severe type of lesion present, according to the hierarchy: nodules ($g=4$) $>$ pustules ($g=3$) $>$ papules ($g=2$) $>$ comedones ($g=1$). We will evaluate each region systematically.\n\n1.  **Forehead:**\n    - Lesion counts: $C=18$, $P=6$, $Pu=0$, $N=0$.\n    - The most severe type of lesion present is a papule ($P > 0$).\n    - Therefore, the region grade is $g_{\\text{forehead}} = 2$.\n    - The weighting factor is $w_{\\text{forehead}} = 2$.\n    - The contribution to the total score is $w_{\\text{forehead}} \\times g_{\\text{forehead}} = 2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\n2.  **Right cheek:**\n    - Lesion counts: $C=22$, $P=3$, $Pu=2$, $N=0$.\n    - The most severe type of lesion present is a pustule ($Pu > 0$).\n    - Therefore, the region grade is $g_{\\text{right cheek}} = 3$.\n    - The weighting factor is $w_{\\text{right cheek}} = 2$.\n    - The contribution to the total score is $w_{\\text{right cheek}} \\times g_{\\text{right cheek}} = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n\n3.  **Left cheek:**\n    - Lesion counts: $C=16$, $P=0$, $Pu=0$, $N=0$.\n    - The most severe type of lesion present is a comedone ($C > 0$). No more severe lesions are present.\n    - Therefore, the region grade is $g_{\\text{left cheek}} = 1$.\n    - The weighting factor is $w_{\\text{left cheek}} = 2$.\n    - The contribution to the total score is $w_{\\text{left cheek}} \\times g_{\\text{left cheek}} = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\n4.  **Nose:**\n    - Lesion counts: $C=8$, $P=2$, $Pu=1$, $N=0$.\n    - The most severe type of lesion present is a pustule ($Pu > 0$).\n    - Therefore, the region grade is $g_{\\text{nose}} = 3$.\n    - The weighting factor is $w_{\\text{nose}} = 1$.\n    - The contribution to the total score is $w_{\\text{nose}} \\times g_{\\text{nose}} = 1 \\times 3 = 3$.\n\n5.  **Chin:**\n    - Lesion counts: $C=5$, $P=0$, $Pu=0$, $N=0$.\n    - The most severe type of lesion present is a comedone ($C > 0$). No more severe lesions are present.\n    - Therefore, the region grade is $g_{\\text{chin}} = 1$.\n    - The weighting factor is $w_{\\text{chin}} = 1$.\n    - The contribution to the total score is $w_{\\text{chin}} \\times g_{\\text{chin}} = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\n6.  **Chest/upper back:**\n    - Lesion counts: $C=10$, $P=7$, $Pu=4$, $N=1$.\n    - The most severe type of lesion present is a nodule ($N > 0$).\n    - Therefore, the region grade is $g_{\\text{chest/back}} = 4$.\n    - The weighting factor is $w_{\\text{chest/back}} = 3$.\n    - The contribution to the total score is $w_{\\text{chest/back}} \\times g_{\\text{chest/back}} = 3 \\times 4 = 12$.\n\nNow, we sum the contributions from all six regions to find the total GAGS score, $S$.\n$$S = (\\text{forehead score}) + (\\text{right cheek score}) + (\\text{left cheek score}) + (\\text{nose score}) + (\\text{chin score}) + (\\text{chest/back score})$$\n$$S = 4 + 6 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 12$$\n$$S = 28$$\n\nFinally, we classify the severity based on the total score $S=28$. The given bands are: mild ($1 \\leq S \\leq 18$), moderate ($19 \\leq S \\leq 30$), severe ($31 \\leq S \\leq 38$), and very severe ($S \\geq 39$). Since $19 \\leq 28 \\leq 30$, the acne severity is classified as **moderate**.
