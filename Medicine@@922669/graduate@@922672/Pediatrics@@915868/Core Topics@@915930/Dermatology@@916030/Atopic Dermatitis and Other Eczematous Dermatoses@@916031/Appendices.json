The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) is a fundamental tool used globally in both clinical trials and practice to quantify the extent and severity of AD. This practice will guide you through the step-by-step calculation of an EASI score from a clinical scenario, providing a concrete understanding of how this composite score is derived from individual signs and affected body surface area [@problem_id:5106315].", "problem": "A pediatric dermatology clinic evaluates disease severity in a child with atopic dermatitis using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) is defined on four anatomical regions: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs. For each region $r$, four clinical signs—erythema, edema or papulation, excoriation, and lichenification—are each graded on an ordinal scale from $0$ (none) to $3$ (severe). The regional severity sum is $S_{r}$, the sum of the four sign scores in that region. The extent of involvement in each region is recorded as the percentage of that region’s surface area involved and converted to an area score $A_{r}$ according to the following mapping: $0$ if $0\\%$, $1$ if $1$–$9\\%$, $2$ if $10$–$29\\%$, $3$ if $30$–$49\\%$, $4$ if $50$–$69\\%$, $5$ if $70$–$89\\%$, and $6$ if $90$–$100\\%$. The regional weighting factors are $W_{\\text{head}}=0.1$ for head and neck, $W_{\\text{upper}}=0.2$ for upper limbs, $W_{\\text{trunk}}=0.3$ for trunk, and $W_{\\text{lower}}=0.4$ for lower limbs. The total EASI is calculated as the sum over regions of the product of the weighting factor, the regional severity sum, and the area score, that is, $\\sum_{r} W_{r}\\,S_{r}\\,A_{r}$, yielding a score from $0$ to $72$.\n\nFor interpretive context, use the following severity bands: clear if $0$, mild if $0.1 \\le \\text{EASI} \\le 5.9$, moderate if $6.0 \\le \\text{EASI} \\le 22.9$, and severe if $23.0 \\le \\text{EASI} \\le 72$.\n\nA $7$-year-old child presents with the following regional findings:\n- Head and neck: involved body surface area (BSA) $10\\%$; erythema $2$, edema or papulation $2$, excoriation $3$, lichenification $1$.\n- Upper limbs: involved BSA $20\\%$; erythema $3$, edema or papulation $2$, excoriation $2$, lichenification $1$.\n- Trunk: involved BSA $15\\%$; erythema $2$, edema or papulation $1$, excoriation $2$, lichenification $1$.\n- Lower limbs: involved BSA $25\\%$; erythema $3$, edema or papulation $3$, excoriation $2$, lichenification $2$.\n\nCompute the EASI and determine the severity category from the given bands.

The rule states that $1$ FTU covers approximately $2\\%$ of the total BSA. Let $N_{FTU}$ be the number of FTUs required. We can set up a direct proportion:\n$$\\frac{N_{FTU}}{BSA_{total}} = \\frac{1 \\text{ FTU}}{2\\% \\text{ BSA}}$$\nSolving for $N_{FTU}$:\n$$N_{FTU} = BSA_{total} \\times \\left( \\frac{1 \\text{ FTU}}{2\\% \\text{ BSA}} \\right)$$\nSubstituting the calculated value for $BSA_{total}$:\n$$N_{FTU} = 27\\% \\times \\left( \\frac{1 \\text{ FTU}}{2\\%} \\right)$$\nThe percentage units cancel, resulting in a dimensionless quantity representing the number of units.\n$$N_{FTU} = \\frac{27}{2} = 13.5$$\nThe problem specifies that the final answer should be rounded to three significant figures.
