The definitions and assumptions are consistent with established principles in hematology and biophysics. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts. The first part is to derive a symbolic relationship for the Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) after dehydration. The second part is to compute a numerical value for the MCHC in a specific dehydrated blood sample.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the MCHC relationship.\n\nLet us define the initial (pre-dehydration) and final (post-dehydration) states of a representative red blood cell. We use the subscript 'pre' for the initial state and 'post' for the final state.\n\nLet $V_{cell, pre}$ be the volume of a single red blood cell before dehydration.\nLet $M_{hb, cell}$ be the mass of hemoglobin within a single red blood cell. By assumption (i), this mass is conserved during the dehydration process, so $M_{hb, cell, pre} = M_{hb, cell, post} = M_{hb, cell}$.\nThe MCHC before dehydration, $\\text{MCHC}_{pre}$, is the hemoglobin mass per unit cell volume, as per definition (iv). Thus, for a single cell:\n$$\n\\text{MCHC}_{pre} = \\frac{M_{hb, cell}}{V_{cell, pre}}\n$$\nThe problem states that $\\phi$ is the fractional loss of red cell water, where $0 < \\phi < 1$. It also states that \"red blood cells behave as perfect osmometers so that the red cell volume contracts in direct proportion to water loss.\" The volume of the cell is lost due to water efflux. The most direct and simple interpretation consistent with this statement is that the fractional loss of total cell volume is equal to $\\phi$. That is, the volume of water lost is a fraction $\\phi$ of the initial cell volume. Let's formalize this interpretation.\nThe change in cell volume, $\\Delta V_{cell}$, is equal to the volume of water lost. This loss is given as a fraction $\\phi$ of the initial cell volume.\n$$\n\\Delta V_{cell} = \\phi \\cdot V_{cell, pre}\n$$\nThe volume of the cell after dehydration, $V_{cell, post}$, is the initial volume minus the volume lost:\n$$\nV_{cell, post} = V_{cell, pre} - \\Delta V_{cell} = V_{cell, pre} - \\phi \\cdot V_{cell, pre} = V_{cell, pre} (1 - \\phi)\n$$\nThe MCHC after dehydration, $\\text{MCHC}_{post}$, is the conserved hemoglobin mass divided by the new, smaller cell volume:\n$$\n\\text{MCHC}_{post} = \\frac{M_{hb, cell}}{V_{cell, post}}\n$$\nWe can express $M_{hb, cell}$ in terms of the initial state: $M_{hb, cell} = \\text{MCHC}_{pre} \\cdot V_{cell, pre}$.\nSubstituting this and the expression for $V_{cell, post}$ into the equation for $\\text{MCHC}_{post}$:\n$$\n\\text{MCHC}_{post} = \\frac{\\text{MCHC}_{pre} \\cdot V_{cell, pre}}{V_{cell, pre} (1 - \\phi)}\n$$\nThe term $V_{cell, pre}$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator, yielding the desired relationship:\n$$\n\\text{MCHC}_{post} = \\frac{\\text{MCHC}_{pre}}{1 - \\phi}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem. This expression correctly shows that MCHC increases as the cell dehydrates (i.e., as $\\phi$ increases from $0$).\n\nPart 2: Computation of the MCHC in a dehydrated blood sample.\n\nThe problem asks to compute the value of the MCHC in a dehydrated sample using the provided clinical measurements. This calculation does not require knowing the pre-dehydration state or the value of $\\phi$, as the data is given for the final, dehydrated state.\n\nWe are given:\nWhole-blood hemoglobin concentration, $C_{hb, blood} = 9.412\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}$\nHematocrit, $Hct = 0.2635$ (dimensionless volume fraction)\n\nWe must operationalize the definition of MCHC using these measurements.\nLet $V_{blood}$ be an arbitrary volume of whole blood.\nThe total mass of hemoglobin, $M_{hb, total}$, in this volume is given by the whole-blood hemoglobin concentration multiplied by the volume of blood:\n$$\nM_{hb, total} = C_{hb, blood} \\cdot V_{blood}\n$$\nThe hematocrit, $Hct$, is the packed red cell volume fraction of whole blood (assumption iii). So, the total volume of packed red blood cells, $V_{rbc, total}$, in the same volume of blood is:\n$$\nV_{rbc, total} = Hct \\cdot V_{blood}\n$$\nThe MCHC is defined as the hemoglobin mass per unit packed red cell volume (assumption iv). Therefore:\n$$\n\\text{MCHC} = \\frac{M_{hb, total}}{V_{rbc, total}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $M_{hb, total}$ and $V_{rbc, total}$:\n$$\n\\text{MCHC} = \\frac{C_{hb, blood} \\cdot V_{blood}}{Hct \\cdot V_{blood}}\n$$\nThe arbitrary volume $V_{blood}$ cancels, giving the standard clinical formula for MCHC:\n$$\n\\text{MCHC} = \\frac{C_{hb, blood}}{Hct}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the dehydrated sample:\n$$\n\\text{MCHC} = \\frac{9.412\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}}{0.2635}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{MCHC} \\approx 35.719165085\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $3$, $5$, $7$, and $1$. The fifth digit is $9$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\n\\text{MCHC} \\approx 35.72\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}\n$$\nThis is the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration of the dehydrated blood sample.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{35.72}\n$$", "id": "5204617"}, {"introduction": "Chronic hemolysis and endothelial dysfunction in sickle cell disease can lead to severe systemic complications, with pulmonary hypertension being a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality. This practice applies the simplified Bernoulli equation, a fundamental principle of fluid dynamics, to translate non-invasive Doppler echocardiography measurements into a vital clinical estimate of pulmonary artery pressure.

The solution is derived from fundamental principles of fluid dynamics as applied in clinical cardiology.\n\nFirst, we must determine the pressure gradient between the right ventricle (RV) and the right atrium (RA) during systole. This gradient is calculated from the peak velocity of the tricuspid regurgitant jet using the simplified Bernoulli equation. The full Bernoulli equation relates pressure, velocity, and potential energy in a fluid. For blood flow across a heart valve, assuming negligible changes in potential energy and that the initial velocity in the large chamber (the RV) is much smaller than the regurgitant jet velocity, the equation simplifies. The pressure drop, $\\Delta P$, is related to the peak jet velocity, $v$, and the density of blood, $\\rho$, by:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 $$\nIn clinical practice, a simplified form is used that directly yields the pressure gradient in millimeters of mercury ($\\mathrm{mmHg}$) from a velocity measured in meters per second ($\\mathrm{m/s}$). This standard clinical formula is:\n$$ \\Delta P = 4v^2 $$\nThe constant, $4$, is an approximation incorporating the density of blood and conversion factors between SI units (Pascals) and clinical units ($\\mathrm{mmHg}$).\n\nGiven the peak velocity of the tricuspid regurgitant jet, $v = 2.9\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, we can calculate the pressure gradient:\n$$ \\Delta P = 4 \\times (2.9)^2 $$\n$$ \\Delta P = 4 \\times 8.41 $$\n$$ \\Delta P = 33.64\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} $$\nThis value, $\\Delta P$, represents the pressure difference between the right ventricle and the right atrium during systole. Therefore:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\text{RVSP} - \\text{RAP} $$\nwhere RVSP is the right ventricular systolic pressure and RAP is the right atrial pressure.\n\nTo find the RVSP, we rearrange this equation:\n$$ \\text{RVSP} = \\Delta P + \\text{RAP} $$\nThe problem provides the estimated right atrial pressure, $\\text{RAP} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$.

In a healthy heart, or more specifically, in the absence of any obstruction between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, the pressures in these two locations are essentially equal during systole. The problem explicitly states that there is no evidence of pulmonic valve stenosis or right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Under this condition, the following approximation is valid:\n$$ \\text{PASP} \\approx \\text{RVSP} $$\nTherefore, the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is:\n$$ \\text{PASP} \\approx 38.64\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived based on the principle of mass conservation.\n\nThe expected total body iron at the end of the specified period, $I_{final}$, can be calculated using a mass balance equation:\n$$I_{final} = I_{initial} + I_{gain} - I_{loss}$$\nwhere $I_{initial}$ is the baseline total body iron, $I_{gain}$ is the total iron acquired from transfusions, and $I_{loss}$ is the total obligatory iron loss over the period. Each term will be calculated sequentially.\n\n**1. Initial Total Body Iron ($I_{initial}$)**\nThe baseline total body iron is given as a concentration per unit mass.\nThe child's mass is $m = 25$ kg.\nThe baseline iron concentration is $C_{Fe, baseline} = 35$ mg/kg.\nTherefore, the initial total body iron is:\n$$I_{initial} = m \\times C_{Fe, baseline} = 25 \\text{ kg} \\times 35 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} = 875 \\text{ mg}$$\n\n**2. Total Iron Gain from Transfusions ($I_{gain}$)**\nThe iron content per unit, $I_{unit}$, is a random variable uniformly distributed on the interval $[200 \\text{ mg}, 250 \\text{ mg}]$. The problem instructs to use the expected iron per unit, which for a uniform distribution is the arithmetic mean of the interval's endpoints.\nThe expected iron per unit, $E[I_{unit}]$, is:\n$$E[I_{unit}] = \\frac{I_{min} + I_{max}}{2} = \\frac{200 \\text{ mg} + 250 \\text{ mg}}{2} = \\frac{450 \\text{ mg}}{2} = 225 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe total number of transfused units is $N = 50$. The total expected iron gain is the product of the number of units and the expected iron content per unit.\n$$I_{gain} = N \\times E[I_{unit}] = 50 \\times 225 \\text{ mg} = 11250 \\text{ mg}$$\n\n**3. Total Obligatory Iron Loss ($I_{loss}$)**\nThe obligatory iron loss occurs at a constant rate of $L_{daily} = 1$ mg/day over a period of $T = 3$ years. To find the total loss, the duration must be converted to days. Assuming a standard year of $365$ days, as no other convention is specified:\nTotal duration in days, $D = 3 \\text{ years} \\times 365 \\frac{\\text{days}}{\\text{year}} = 1095 \\text{ days}$\nThe total iron loss is the daily loss rate multiplied by the duration in days:\n$$I_{loss} = L_{daily} \\times D = 1 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}} \\times 1095 \\text{ days} = 1095 \\text{ mg}$$\n\n**4. Final Total Body Iron ($I_{final}$)**\nNow, we combine the calculated terms to find the final expected total body iron in milligrams:\n$$I_{final} = I_{initial} + I_{gain} - I_{loss}$$\n$$I_{final} = 875 \\text{ mg} + 11250 \\text{ mg} - 1095 \\text{ mg}$$\n$$I_{final} = 12125 \\text{ mg} - 1095 \\text{ mg} = 11030 \\text{ mg}$$\n\n**5.
