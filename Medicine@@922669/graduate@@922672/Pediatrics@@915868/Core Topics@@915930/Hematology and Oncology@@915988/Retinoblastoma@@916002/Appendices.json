This first exercise allows you to apply core principles of Mendelian genetics to a real-world clinical counseling scenario, calculating the probability that the child of a carrier will develop the disease.

Clinical penetrance is defined as the conditional probability that an individual expressing the genotype will manifest the phenotype.

Using only these premises and probability laws, compute the overall probability that a child of this carrier will develop retinoblastoma. Express your answer as a decimal and round to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the overall probability that a child of a carrier of a germline Retinoblastoma 1 ($RB1$) gene mutation will develop retinoblastoma. The problem statement is first validated for correctness and solvability.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   The parent is heterozygous at the $RB1$ locus, carrying one mutant allele and one wild-type allele.\n-   The probability of a child inheriting the mutant allele from this heterozygous parent is $0.5$.\n-   The clinical penetrance, $p$, for germline $RB1$ mutation carriers is $p = 0.9$. Penetrance is defined as the conditional probability that an individual with the predisposing genotype (in this case, carrying the germline mutation) will manifest the phenotype (develop retinoblastoma).\n-   The other parent is unaffected and, by implication, homozygous for the wild-type allele at the $RB1$ locus.\n-   There are no *de novo* mutations.\n-   There is no germline mosaicism.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, drawing upon established principles of Mendelian genetics and the epidemiology of hereditary retinoblastoma. The concepts of heterozygosity, autosomal inheritance, and penetrance are well-defined. The provided numerical values ($0.5$ for allele transmission and $0.9$ for penetrance) are standard and realistic for this condition. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and objective. It provides all necessary information and constraints (e.g., \"no de novo mutations\") to permit a unique and meaningful solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Solution\nWe can solve this problem using the law of total probability. Let us define the relevant events:\n-   Let $M$ be the event that the child inherits the mutant $RB1$ allele from the heterozygous parent.\n-   Let $M^c$ be the complementary event that the child inherits the wild-type allele from the heterozygous parent.\n-   Let $D$ be the event that the child develops retinoblastoma.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the probability of inheriting the mutant allele:\n$$P(M) = 0.5$$\nSince $M$ and $M^c$ are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events, the probability of inheriting the wild-type allele is:\n$$P(M^c) = 1 - P(M) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$$\n\nWe are also given the penetrance, which is the conditional probability of developing retinoblastoma given that the child has inherited the mutant allele. This is expressed as:\n$$P(D|M) = p = 0.9$$\n\nNext, we must consider the probability of developing retinoblastoma if the child does *not* inherit the mutant allele, which is the event $M^c$. In this case, the child receives a wild-type allele from the carrier parent. The problem states that the other parent is unaffected, which implies they are homozygous for the wild-type allele and can only contribute a wild-type allele. Therefore, a child in the $M^c$ scenario has a genotype that is homozygous for the wild-type allele. The problem also specifies that there are no *de novo* mutations. Consequently, without a mutant allele, the child cannot develop the hereditary form of retinoblastoma. The probability of developing the disease in this case is zero.\n$$P(D|M^c) = 0$$\n\nThe law of total probability states that the total probability of an event $D$ can be found by summing the probabilities of $D$ conditioned on a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events. Here, the events are $M$ and $M^c$.\n$$P(D) = P(D|M)P(M) + P(D|M^c)P(M^c)$$\n\nSubstituting the values we have established:\n$$P(D) = (0.9) \\times (0.5) + (0) \\times (0.5)$$\n$$P(D) = 0.45 + 0$$\n$$P(D) = 0.45$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The calculated probability is $0.45$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $0.4500$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4500}$$", "id": "4723449"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis is made, the focus shifts to prognosis and the likelihood of successful treatment.

We begin from the fundamental principles of probability theory.\n\nLet $g \\in \\{A, B, C, D, E\\}$ denote the ICIRB group and $s \\in \\{\\text{none}, \\text{focal}, \\text{diffuse}\\}$ denote the seeds burden category. The problem provides the following quantities:\n- $p^{0}_{g}$: the baseline ocular salvage probability for group $g$ with no seeds.\n- $r_{g,s}$: the absolute reduction in salvage probability for an eye in group $g$ with seeds burden $s$. Note that $r_{g,\\text{none}} = 0$.\n- $\\pi_{g,s}$: the probability that an eye in group $g$ has seeds burden $s$. This is a conditional probability, $P(\\text{seeds}=s | \\text{group}=g)$.\n- $w_{g}$: the proportion of the cohort belonging to group $g$. This is the marginal probability $P(\\text{group}=g)$.\n\nFor any given eye, let $S$ be the event of ocular salvage. We are asked to find the expected salvage probability within each group, $E[P(S) | \\text{group}=g]$, and the overall expected salvage probability for the cohort, $E[P(S)]$.\n\nFirst, we determine the expected salvage probability for a specific ICIRB group, let us denote it by $P_g$. The set of seeds burden categories, $\\{\\text{none}, \\text{focal}, \\text{diffuse}\\}$, constitutes a partition of the sample space for any given group $g$. By the law of total probability, the probability of salvage for an eye in group $g$ is the weighted average of the salvage probabilities for each seed category, where the weights are the probabilities of an eye in group $g$ having that seed category.\n\nThe salvage probability for an eye in group $g$ with a specific seeds burden $s$ is given by $p_{g,s} = p^{0}_{g} - r_{g,s}$.\n\nThe expected salvage probability for group $g$, $P_g$, is therefore:\n$$P_g = \\sum_{s \\in \\{\\text{none, focal, diffuse}\\}} p_{g,s} \\cdot \\pi_{g,s}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_{g,s}$:\n$$P_g = \\sum_{s} (p^{0}_{g} - r_{g,s}) \\cdot \\pi_{g,s}$$\n$$P_g = \\sum_{s} p^{0}_{g}\\pi_{g,s} - \\sum_{s} r_{g,s}\\pi_{g,s}$$\nSince $p^{0}_{g}$ is constant with respect to $s$, we can factor it out of the first summation:\n$$P_g = p^{0}_{g} \\sum_{s} \\pi_{g,s} - \\sum_{s} r_{g,s}\\pi_{g,s}$$\nAs the seeds burden categories form a partition, the sum of their probabilities for any group $g$ must be $1$: $\\sum_{s} \\pi_{g,s} = 1$. This simplifies the expression for $P_g$ to:\n$$P_g = p^{0}_{g} - \\sum_{s} r_{g,s}\\pi_{g,s}$$\nThis equation shows that the expected salvage probability for a group is the baseline (best-case) probability reduced by the expected value of the probability reduction due to seeds. The term $\\sum_{s} r_{g,s}\\pi_{g,s}$ is the expected reduction for group $g$.\n\nWe now compute $P_g$ for each group using the provided data.\n\nFor Group A:\n$P_A = p^{0}_{A} - (r_{A,\\text{none}}\\pi_{A,\\text{none}} + r_{A,\\text{focal}}\\pi_{A,\\text{focal}} + r_{A,\\text{diffuse}}\\pi_{A,\\text{diffuse}})$\n$P_A = 0.99 - (0 \\cdot 0.85 + 0.02 \\cdot 0.12 + 0.05 \\cdot 0.03)$\n$P_A = 0.99 - (0 + 0.0024 + 0.0015) = 0.99 - 0.0039 = 0.9861$\n\nFor Group B:\n$P_B = p^{0}_{B} - (r_{B,\\text{none}}\\pi_{B,\\text{none}} + r_{B,\\text{focal}}\\pi_{B,\\text{focal}} + r_{B,\\text{diffuse}}\\pi_{B,\\text{diffuse}})$\n$P_B = 0.96 - (0 \\cdot 0.70 + 0.03 \\cdot 0.20 + 0.06 \\cdot 0.10)$\n$P_B = 0.96 - (0 + 0.006 + 0.006) = 0.96 - 0.012 = 0.9480$\n\nFor Group C:\n$P_C = p^{0}_{C} - (r_{C,\\text{none}}\\pi_{C,\\text{none}} + r_{C,\\text{focal}}\\pi_{C,\\text{focal}} + r_{C,\\text{diffuse}}\\pi_{C,\\text{diffuse}})$\n$P_C = 0.88 - (0 \\cdot 0.50 + 0.09 \\cdot 0.30 + 0.18 \\cdot 0.20)$\n$P_C = 0.88 - (0 + 0.027 + 0.036) = 0.88 - 0.063 = 0.8170$\n\nFor Group D:\n$P_D = p^{0}_{D} - (r_{D,\\text{none}}\\pi_{D,\\text{none}} + r_{D,\\text{focal}}\\pi_{D,\\text{focal}} + r_{D,\\text{diffuse}}\\pi_{D,\\text{diffuse}})$\n$P_D = 0.74 - (0 \\cdot 0.25 + 0.16 \\cdot 0.40 + 0.30 \\cdot 0.35)$\n$P_D = 0.74 - (0 + 0.064 + 0.105) = 0.74 - 0.169 = 0.5710$\n\nFor Group E:\n$P_E = p^{0}_{E} - (r_{E,\\text{none}}\\pi_{E,\\text{none}} + r_{E,\\text{focal}}\\pi_{E,\\text{focal}} + r_{E,\\text{diffuse}}\\pi_{E,\\text{diffuse}})$\n$P_E = 0.28 - (0 \\cdot 0.15 + 0.08 \\cdot 0.35 + 0.18 \\cdot 0.50)$\n$P_E = 0.28 - (0 + 0.028 + 0.090) = 0.28 - 0.118 = 0.1620$\n\nThe expected ocular salvage probabilities for each group are: $P_A=0.9861$, $P_B=0.9480$, $P_C=0.8170$, $P_D=0.5710$, and $P_E=0.1620$.\n\nQualitatively, the seeds burden modifies the stratified estimates by introducing a more realistic prognosis. The baseline probability $p^{0}_{g}$ represents an idealized scenario (no seeds). The term $\\sum_{s} r_{g,s}\\pi_{g,s}$ acts as an 'expected penalty' for the group, which is determined by both the likelihood of having seeds ($\\pi_{g,s}$ for $s \\neq \\text{none}$) and the severity of their impact ($r_{g,s}$). For instance, Group D has a high baseline salvage probability of $0.74$, but it also has a high probability of presenting with seeds ($1-\\pi_{D,\\text{none}} = 0.75$) and these seeds induce substantial reductions ($r_{D,\\text{focal}}=0.16$, $r_{D,\\text{diffuse}}=0.30$). This results in a large expected reduction of $0.169$, lowering the realistic salvage expectation to $0.571$. Thus, accounting for the seeds burden provides a more accurate, and lower, estimate of salvage by averaging over the heterogeneous outcomes within each group.\n\nNext, we compute the overall expected ocular salvage probability for the entire cohort, $P_{\\text{overall}}$. The ICIRB groups $\\{A, B, C, D, E\\}$ form a partition of the cohort.
