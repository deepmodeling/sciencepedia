The problem states that the slope of this linear relationship is the constant $k$. Mathematically, this is expressed as the derivative of the total calcium with respect to albumin:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\left[\\mathrm{Ca}\\right]_{\\text{total}}}{dA} = k\n$$\nFor a finite change in albumin, $\\Delta A$, the corresponding change in total calcium, $\\Delta\\left[\\mathrm{Ca}\\right]_{\\text{total}}$, is given by integration, which in this linear model simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta\\left[\\mathrm{Ca}\\right]_{\\text{total}} = k \\cdot \\Delta A\n$$\nWe are asked to find the corrected calcium, $\\left[\\mathrm{Ca}\\right]_{\\text{corr}}$, which is defined as the theoretical total calcium concentration if the patient's albumin were at a reference level, $A_{\\text{ref}}$.

Therefore, the changes in calcium and albumin are:\n$$\n\\Delta\\left[\\mathrm{Ca}\\right]_{\\text{total}} = \\left[\\mathrm{Ca}\\right]_{\\text{corr}} - \\left[\\mathrm{Ca}\\right]_{\\text{meas}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta A = A_{\\text{ref}} - A\n$$\nSubstituting these definitions into the linear model equation yields:\n$$\n\\left[\\mathrm{Ca}\\right]_{\\text{corr}} - \\left[\\mathrm{Ca}\\right]_{\\text{meas}} = k \\cdot (A_{\\text{ref}} - A)\n$$\nSolving for $\\left[\\mathrm{Ca}\\right]_{\\text{corr}}$, we obtain the general expression for the corrected total calcium:\n$$\n\\left[\\mathrm{Ca}\\right]_{\\text{corr}} = \\left[\\mathrm{Ca}\\right]_{\\text{meas}} + k \\cdot (A_{\\text{ref}} - A)\n$$\nThis is the first part of the required solution.

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe first step is to derive the expression for the tubular reabsorption of phosphate ($\\mathrm{TRP}$). $\\mathrm{TRP}$ is the fraction of phosphate that is filtered by the glomerulus and subsequently reabsorbed by the renal tubules. It is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TRP} = \\frac{\\text{Phosphate Filtered} - \\text{Phosphate Excreted}}{\\text{Phosphate Filtered}} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{Phosphate Excreted Rate}}{\\text{Phosphate Filtered Rate}}\n$$\nLet the glomerular filtration rate be $\\mathrm{GFR}$ and the urine flow rate be $V$. The serum phosphate concentration is $S_P$ and the urine phosphate concentration is $U_P$. Based on the first principles provided:\n-   Phosphate Filtered Rate $= \\mathrm{GFR} \\times S_P$\n-   Phosphate Excreted Rate $= V \\times U_P$\n\nSubstituting these into the $\\mathrm{TRP}$ equation gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TRP} = 1 - \\frac{V \\times U_P}{\\mathrm{GFR} \\times S_P}\n$$\nThis expression contains the unknown quantities $V$ and $\\mathrm{GFR}$. We use the third principle, which states that $\\mathrm{GFR}$ is approximated by the creatinine clearance ($C_{\\mathrm{Cr}}$). The clearance of creatinine is calculated as the rate of creatinine excretion divided by its serum concentration:\n$$\n\\mathrm{GFR} \\approx C_{\\mathrm{Cr}} = \\frac{\\text{Creatinine Excreted Rate}}{\\text{Serum Creatinine Concentration}} = \\frac{V \\times U_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}{S_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}\n$$\nwhere $U_{\\mathrm{Cr}}$ is the urine creatinine concentration and $S_{\\mathrm{Cr}}$ is the serum creatinine concentration.\n\nWe can now substitute this expression for $\\mathrm{GFR}$ into the $\\mathrm{TRP}$ equation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TRP} = 1 - \\frac{V \\times U_P}{\\left(\\frac{V \\times U_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}{S_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}\\right) \\times S_P}\n$$\nThe urine flow rate $V$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, which is why a spot urine sample is sufficient. This yields the final expression for $\\mathrm{TRP}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TRP} = 1 - \\frac{U_P \\times S_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}{U_{\\mathrm{Cr}} \\times S_P}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the numerical value of $\\mathrm{TRP}$ using the provided data: $S_{P} = 0.70 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$, $S_{\\mathrm{Cr}} = 35 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu mol/L}$, $U_{P} = 10.0 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$, and $U_{\\mathrm{Cr}} = 3500 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu mol/L}$. The ratios $U_P/S_P$ and $S_{Cr}/U_{Cr}$ are dimensionless, so the units within each ratio must be consistent, which they are.\n$$\n\\mathrm{TRP} = 1 - \\frac{(10.0 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}) \\times (35 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu mol/L})}{(3500 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu mol/L}) \\times (0.70 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L})} = 1 - \\frac{350}{2450} = 1 - \\frac{35}{245}\n$$\nSince $245 = 7 \\times 35$, the fraction simplifies to $1/7$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{TRP} = 1 - \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{6}{7}\n$$\nAs a decimal, $\\mathrm{TRP} \\approx 0.85714$. The problem states to use the formula for the low-transport regime if $\\mathrm{TRP} \\leq 0.86$. Since $0.85714... \\leq 0.86$, this condition is met.\n\nWe now derive the expression for the tubular maximum for phosphate corrected for GFR, $\\mathrm{TmP/GFR}$. This value represents the theoretical plasma phosphate concentration threshold for renal phosphate reabsorption. In the regime of significant phosphate wasting (low $\\mathrm{TRP}$), $\\mathrm{TmP/GFR}$ is estimated by the actual rate of phosphate reabsorption per unit of GFR, which we denote as $T_P/\\mathrm{GFR}$.\n\nThe amount of phosphate reabsorbed per unit volume of filtrate ($T_P/\\mathrm{GFR}$) is the amount filtered per unit volume ($S_P$) minus the amount excreted per unit volume of filtrate.\n$$\n\\frac{T_P}{\\mathrm{GFR}} = S_P - \\frac{\\text{Phosphate Excreted Rate}}{\\mathrm{GFR}} = S_P - \\frac{V \\times U_P}{\\mathrm{GFR}}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\mathrm{GFR} \\approx (V \\times U_{\\mathrm{Cr}})/S_{\\mathrm{Cr}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{T_P}{\\mathrm{GFR}} = S_P - \\frac{V \\times U_P}{(V \\times U_{\\mathrm{Cr}})/S_{\\mathrm{Cr}}} = S_P - \\frac{U_P S_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}{U_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}\n$$\nTherefore, in this regime, the expression for $\\mathrm{TmP/GFR}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TmP/GFR} = S_P - \\frac{U_P S_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}{U_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}\n$$\nAn equivalent expression is $\\mathrm{TmP/GFR} = S_P \\times \\mathrm{TRP}$, which can be shown by substituting the expression for TRP: $S_P \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{U_P S_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}{U_{\\mathrm{Cr}} S_P}\\right) = S_P - \\frac{U_P S_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}{U_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}$.\n\nUsing this formula, we calculate the numerical value of $\\mathrm{TmP/GFR}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TmP/GFR} = 0.70 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} - \\frac{(10.0 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}) \\times (35 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu mol/L})}{3500 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu mol/L}}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{TmP/GFR} = 0.70 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} - \\frac{350}{3500} \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} = 0.70 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} - 0.10 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{TmP/GFR} = 0.60 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}\n$$\nAlternatively, using the $\\mathrm{TRP}$ value:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TmP/GFR} = S_P \\times \\mathrm{TRP} = (0.70 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}) \\times \\frac{6}{7} = 6 \\times \\frac{0.70}{7} \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} = 6 \\times 0.10 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} = 0.60 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\mathrm{TmP/GFR} = 0.600 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}\n$$\nThis low value is consistent with the diagnosis of a renal phosphate wasting disorder like hypophosphatemic rickets.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.600}\n$$", "id": "5200630"}, {"introduction": "With a confirmed diagnosis of a phosphate wasting disorder like X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), the focus shifts to therapeutic management.
