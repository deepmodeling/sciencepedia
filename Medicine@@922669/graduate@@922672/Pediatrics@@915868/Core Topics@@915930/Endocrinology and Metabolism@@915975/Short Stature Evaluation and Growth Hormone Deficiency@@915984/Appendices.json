This exercise introduces the concept of the Standard Deviation Score ($SDS$), also known as a Z-score, which is the cornerstone of modern auxology.

In such a setting, a “standard score” transforms a raw measurement $X$ with population mean $\\mu$ and population standard deviation $\\sigma$ into a unitless measure of deviation that facilitates clinical thresholds. Pediatric short stature is commonly defined as height less than $-2$ standard deviations below the age–sex mean. Consider a $7$-year-old boy whose measured standing height is $112\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. He is referenced to a growth chart in which the mean height for boys at age $7$ years is $122\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and the standard deviation is $5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. Using the core definition of a standard score in a Gaussian framework, compute the child’s height standard deviation score relative to this reference and then decide, on the basis of that score, whether he meets the above short stature criterion.

Modeling anthropometric traits like height with a Gaussian distribution is a cornerstone of biostatistics. The concept of a standard score (or Z-score) is a fundamental statistical tool. The clinical threshold of $-2$ standard deviations for defining short stature is a widely accepted convention in pediatrics (e.g., by the WHO and CDC).\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

It is scientifically sound, complete, and unambiguous.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core of this problem is the calculation of a standard score, which is also commonly referred to as a Z-score or, in this clinical context, a Standard Deviation Score ($SDS$). This score quantifies the number of standard deviations by which a raw measurement deviates from the mean of the reference distribution.\n\nThe formula for the standard score is given by:\n$$\nSDS = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n$$\nwhere:\n-   $X$ is the individual measurement.\n-   $\\mu$ is the mean of the reference population.\n-   $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the reference population.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following values:\n-   The child's measured height, $X = 112\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n-   The mean height for the reference population, $\\mu = 122\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n-   The standard deviation of height for the reference population, $\\sigma = 5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the $SDS$ formula:\n$$\nSDS = \\frac{112 - 122}{5}\n$$\nFirst, we evaluate the numerator, which represents the deviation from the mean:\n$$\n112 - 122 = -10\n$$\nThe result is a deviation of $-10\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ from the mean height.\n\nNext, we divide this deviation by the standard deviation to normalize it:\n$$\nSDS = \\frac{-10}{5} = -2\n$$\nThe child's height standard deviation score is exactly $-2$.\n\nThe second part of the task requires a decision on whether the child meets the criterion for short stature. The criterion is explicitly defined as \"height less than $-2$ standard deviations below the age–sex mean.\" In terms of the standard deviation score, this corresponds to the strict inequality:\n$$\nSDS < -2\n$$\nOur calculated score is $SDS = -2$. Since the value $-2$ is not strictly less than $-2$ (i.e., the statement $-2 < -2$ is false), the child's height is exactly at the $-2$ standard deviation threshold, not below it. Therefore, based on the rigorous interpretation of the given definition, the child does not meet this specific criterion for short stature.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical height standard deviation score as the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-2}$$", "id": "5204422"}, {"introduction": "While a single height measurement provides a static snapshot, the rate of growth is a dynamic and more sensitive indicator of a potential underlying issue. This practice focuses on calculating a child's annualized growth velocity from serial measurements. Mastering this calculation is essential, as a slow growth velocity is often the most critical red flag that prompts a full diagnostic workup for conditions like Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) [@problem_id:5204414].", "problem": "A $6$-year-old child is being evaluated for short stature. The fundamental definition of linear growth velocity is the rate of change of stature with respect to time, expressed mathematically as $v(t) = \\frac{dh}{dt}$, where $h$ is height and $t$ is time.
