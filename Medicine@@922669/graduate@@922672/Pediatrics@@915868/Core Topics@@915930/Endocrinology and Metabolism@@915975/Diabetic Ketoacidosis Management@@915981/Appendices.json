Based on plasma electroneutrality in aqueous solution, the algebraic sum of charges contributed by measurable strong cations and anions must balance those of unmeasured ions.

We proceed with the solution.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Anion Gap Expression**\n\nThe fundamental principle governing ion concentrations in plasma is that of electroneutrality. This principle requires that the total concentration of positive charges (cations) must equal the total concentration of negative charges (anions). We can express this as:\n$$\n\\sum_{i} [\\text{Cation}_i] \\cdot z_i = \\sum_{j} [\\text{Anion}_j] \\cdot z_j\n$$\nwhere $[C]$ is the molar concentration of an ion $C$ and $z$ is its valency.\n\nFor practical purposes in clinical chemistry, ions are grouped into those that are routinely measured and those that are not. Let us separate the cations and anions into measured (M) and unmeasured (U) components:\n$$\n([\\text{Cations}]_M) + ([\\text{Cations}]_U) = ([\\text{Anions}]_M) + ([\\text{Anions}]_U)\n$$\nHere, the concentrations are expressed in milliequivalents per liter ($\\mathrm{mEq/L}$) to account for charge, which for the singly charged ions of interest is equivalent to millimoles per liter ($\\mathrm{mmol/L}$).\n\nThe anion gap (AG) is defined operationally as the difference between the sum of unmeasured anions and the sum of unmeasured cations. Rearranging the electroneutrality equation to isolate these unmeasured ions yields:\n$$\n([\\text{Anions}]_U) - ([\\text{Cations}]_U) = ([\\text{Cations}]_M) - ([\\text{Anions}]_M)\n$$\nThus, the anion gap is given by the difference between the major measured cations and the major measured anions in plasma:\n$$\n\\text{AG} = ([\\text{Cations}]_M) - ([\\text{Anions}]_M)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Justification of Approximations for Clinical Use**\n\nThe problem requires deriving the expression using the *principal* measured ions. In standard clinical practice, the set of measured ions is conventionally simplified.\nThe principal measured cation is sodium ($[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]$).\nThe principal measured anions are chloride ($[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]$) and bicarbonate ($[\\mathrm{HCO}_3^{-}]$).\n\nThis leads to the most common formula for the anion gap:\n$$\n\\text{AG} = [\\mathrm{Na}^{+}] - ([\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}] + [\\mathrm{HCO}_3^{-}])\n$$\nThis formula makes several justified approximations by omitting other, less abundant measured ions:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Omission of Potassium ($[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]$):} Potassium is a measured cation, but its plasma concentration (typically $3.5-5.0\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$) is much smaller than that of sodium (typically $135-145\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$). Its variation is also relatively small. While a formula including potassium, $\\text{AG} = ([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}] + [\\mathrm{K}^{+}]) - ([\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}] + [\\mathrm{HCO}_3^{-}])$, is sometimes used, omitting it is the prevailing convention. The reference range for the AG is established based on the chosen formula, making consistent use paramount.\n    \\item \\textbf{Omission of other ions:} Other cations like ionized calcium ($[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$) at $\\approx 1.2\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$ and magnesium ($[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]$) at $\\approx 0.8\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$, and other anions like phosphate, sulfate, and plasma proteins (primarily albumin) contribute to the overall charge balance. In a healthy state, the concentration of these unmeasured cations largely offsets the concentration of unmeasured anions, resulting in a \"normal\" anion gap (typically $8-12\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$). The simplified formula treats this baseline balance as a constant, allowing for the detection of clinically significant changes, such as the accumulation of organic acids in DKA.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe standard formula is therefore a practical and effective tool for identifying a surplus of unmeasured anions.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Plasma Anion Gap**\n\nUsing the derived standard formula and the provided laboratory values:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Sodium ($[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]$): $133\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n    \\item Chloride ($[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]$): $99\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n    \\item Bicarbonate ($[\\mathrm{HCO}_3^{-}]$): $10\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n\\end{itemize}\nWe calculate the anion gap:\n$$\n\\text{AG} = [\\mathrm{Na}^{+}] - ([\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}] + [\\mathrm{HCO}_3^{-}])\n$$\n$$\n\\text{AG} = 133\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} - (99\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} + 10\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{AG} = 133\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} - 109\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} = 24\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested gives $24.0\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$.\n\n**Part 4: Interpretation and Consistency with Ketoanion Concentration**\n\nThe calculated anion gap of $24.0\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$ is significantly elevated above the normal reference range (typically $8-12\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$), indicating a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. This is the expected finding in DKA.\n\nTo assess consistency, we must determine if the magnitude of the increase in the anion gap can be accounted for by the measured and estimated concentrations of the unmeasured acid anions responsible for the acidosis. The increase in the anion gap ($\\Delta_{\\text{AG}}$) from a normal baseline (we assume a baseline of $12\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$) is:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{AG}} = \\text{Calculated AG} - \\text{Baseline AG} = 24.0\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} - 12\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} = 12.0\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}\n$$\nThis increase should stoichiometrically match the sum of the concentrations of the new, pathological anions. The problem provides concentrations for the main anions:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $[\\beta\\text{-OHB}^{-}]$: $8.0\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n    \\item $[\\text{Lactate}^{-}]$: $2.0\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n\\end{itemize}\nThe other primary ketoanion is acetoacetate ($[\\text{AcAc}^{-}]$). Its concentration can be estimated from the given typical ratio of $[\\beta\\text{-OHB}^{-}]$ to $[\\text{AcAc}^{-}]$, which is between $3:1$ and $10:1$.\n$$\n\\frac{[\\beta\\text{-OHB}^{-}]}{[\\text{AcAc}^{-}]} = k, \\quad \\text{where } 3 \\leq k \\leq 10\n$$\nTherefore, the concentration of acetoacetate is in the range:\n$$\n[\\text{AcAc}^{-}] = \\frac{[\\beta\\text{-OHB}^{-}]}{k} = \\frac{8.0\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}}{k}\n$$\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item For $k=10$, $[\\text{AcAc}^{-}] = \\frac{8.0}{10} = 0.8\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n    \\item For $k=3$, $[\\text{AcAc}^{-}] = \\frac{8.0}{3} \\approx 2.67\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n\\end{itemize}\nThe total concentration of these unmeasured acid anions is the sum $[\\beta\\text{-OHB}^{-}] + [\\text{AcAc}^{-}] + [\\text{Lactate}^{-}]$. We calculate the range for this sum:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Lower bound of anion sum: $8.0 + 0.8 + 2.0 = 10.8\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n    \\item Upper bound of anion sum: $8.0 + 2.67 + 2.0 = 12.67\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n\\end{itemize}\nThe estimated total concentration of the major unmeasured organic anions is approximately $10.8 - 12.7\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$. The calculated increase in the anion gap, $\\Delta_{\\text{AG}}$, is $12.0\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$.\n\nThis value of $12.0\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$ falls squarely within the estimated range of the causative anions ($10.8 - 12.7\\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$). This demonstrates excellent quantitative consistency between the anion gap calculated from electrolytes and the sum of the specific acid anions known to be present in DKA. The magnitude of the anion gap is thus broadly consistent with, and almost entirely explained by, the measured $\\beta$-hydroxybutyrate, the estimated acetoacetate, and the measured lactate.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{24.0}\n$$", "id": "5133672"}, {"introduction": "Proper fluid management is arguably the most critical intervention in preventing the most feared complication of pediatric DKA: cerebral edema.
