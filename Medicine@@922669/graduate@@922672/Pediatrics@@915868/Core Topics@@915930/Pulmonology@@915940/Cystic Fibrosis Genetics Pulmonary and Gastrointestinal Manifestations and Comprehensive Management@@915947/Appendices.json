We can proceed with the solution.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $C$: The event that the partner is a carrier for cystic fibrosis.\n- $N$: The event that the partner is not a carrier for cystic fibrosis.\n- $T^-$: The event that the partner's mutation panel result is negative.\n- $T^+$: The event that the partner's mutation panel result is positive.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1.  The prior probability that the partner is a carrier, based on their ancestry's carrier frequency, is $P(C) = \\frac{1}{25} = 0.04$.\n2.  The prior probability that the partner is not a carrier is therefore $P(N) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - \\frac{1}{25} = \\frac{24}{25} = 0.96$.\n3.  The analytic sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the person is a carrier: $P(T^+|C) = 0.90$.\n4.  The analytic specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the person is not a carrier. The problem states this can be approximated as $1.00$, so we take $P(T^-|N) = 1.00$.\n\nOur objective is to calculate the posterior probability that the partner is a carrier given that their test result was negative. This is the conditional probability $P(C|T^-)$.\n\nAccording to the fundamental definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$P(C|T^-) = \\frac{P(C \\cap T^-)}{P(T^-)}$$\nwhere $P(C \\cap T^-)$ is the joint probability of the partner being a carrier and testing negative, and $P(T^-)$ is the total probability of testing negative.\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, $P(C \\cap T^-)$. This can be found using the multiplication rule for conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$.\n$$P(C \\cap T^-) = P(T^-|C)P(C)$$\nWe need to find $P(T^-|C)$, which is the probability of a negative test given the partner is a carrier. This is also known as the false negative rate. Since a carrier must test either positive or negative, the sum of the probabilities of these two outcomes is $1$.\n$$P(T^+|C) + P(T^-|C) = 1$$\nTherefore,\n$$P(T^-|C) = 1 - P(T^+|C) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\nNow we can compute the numerator:\n$$P(C \\cap T^-) = P(T^-|C)P(C) = 0.10 \\times 0.04 = 0.004$$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, $P(T^-)$, which is the total probability of a negative test. A person can test negative in two mutually exclusive ways: (1) they are a carrier and test negative ($C \\cap T^-$), or (2) they are not a carrier and test negative ($N \\cap T^-$). By the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(C \\cap T^-) + P(N \\cap T^-)$$\nWe have already calculated $P(C \\cap T^-) = 0.004$. We now calculate $P(N \\cap T^-)$ using the multiplication rule:\n$$P(N \\cap T^-) = P(T^-|N)P(N)$$\nUsing the given values:\n$$P(N \\cap T^-) = 1.00 \\times 0.96 = 0.96$$\nNow we can sum the probabilities to find the total probability of a negative test:\n$$P(T^-) = 0.004 + 0.96 = 0.964$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerator and denominator back into the formula for $P(C|T^-)$:\n$$P(C|T^-) = \\frac{P(C \\cap T^-)}{P(T^-)} = \\frac{0.004}{0.964}$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$P(C|T^-) \\approx 0.00414937759...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $4$, $1$, $4$, and $9$.

The current is proportional to the product of the number of functional channels at the cell surface, $N$, the channel open probability, $P_o$, and the single-channel conductance, $\\gamma$. We can write this as an equation with a proportionality constant, $k$, which incorporates other factors such as the fixed ionic driving force.\n$$I = k \\cdot N \\cdot P_o \\cdot \\gamma$$\n\nNext, we define the wild-type state as a reference. A wild-type individual possesses two identical, fully functional CFTR alleles. The problem states that channels from the two alleles contribute additively and, in the wild-type case, equally to the total current. Let $I_{WT}$ be the total current in a wild-type cell. Let $N_{allele,WT}$ be the number of channels produced by a single wild-type allele, and let $P_{o,WT}$ be the open probability of these wild-type channels.

All necessary data are provided, the constraints are clear, and the objective is unambiguous. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the maximal allowable per-meal lipase dose, $U_{\\max}$, by adhering to two independent safety constraints. A safe dose, $U$, must satisfy both the body-mass-based ceiling and the dietary-fat-based ceiling. These constraints are expressed as two inequalities:\n$1.$ The dose must not exceed the limit based on the child's mass: $U \\leq u_{\\mathrm{kg}} \\cdot m$.\n$2.$ The dose must not exceed the limit based on the meal's fat content: $U \\leq u_{\\mathrm{fat}} \\cdot F$.\n\nTo satisfy both conditions simultaneously, the dose $U$ must be less than or equal to the minimum of these two upper bounds. The maximal allowable dose, $U_{\\max}$, is therefore the lesser of the two calculated ceilings. This can be expressed formally as:\n$$U_{\\max} = \\min(u_{\\mathrm{kg}} \\cdot m, u_{\\mathrm{fat}} \\cdot F)$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the maximum dose allowed by the body-mass ceiling. Let's denote this limit as $U_{\\text{limit, kg}}$.\n$$U_{\\text{limit, kg}} = u_{\\mathrm{kg}} \\cdot m$$\nSubstituting the given values, $u_{\\mathrm{kg}} = 2,500~\\text{units} \\cdot \\text{kg}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{meal}^{-1}$ and $m = 20~\\text{kg}$:\n$$U_{\\text{limit, kg}} = 2,500 \\cdot 20 = 50,000~\\text{units}$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the maximum dose allowed by the dietary-fat ceiling. Let's denote this limit as $U_{\\text{limit, fat}}$.\n$$U_{\\text{limit, fat}} = u_{\\mathrm{fat}} \\cdot F$$\nSubstituting the given values, $u_{\\mathrm{fat}} = 4,000~\\text{units} \\cdot \\text{g}^{-1}$ and $F = 30~\\text{g}$:\n$$U_{\\text{limit, fat}} = 4,000 \\cdot 30 = 120,000~\\text{units}$$\n\nNow, we determine $U_{\\max}$ by taking the minimum of these two values. The body-mass ceiling is more restrictive in this case.\n$$U_{\\max} = \\min(U_{\\text{limit, kg}}, U_{\\text{limit, fat}}) = \\min(50,000, 120,000) = 50,000~\\text{units}$$\n\nThe final step is to determine the number of capsules, $n$, that can be administered. Since capsules cannot be divided, $n$ must be an integer. The total lipase dose from $n$ capsules is $n \\cdot U_c$, where $U_c$ is the lipase content per capsule. This total dose must not exceed the maximal allowable dose, $U_{\\max}$.\n$$n \\cdot U_c \\leq U_{\\max}$$\n\nWe need to find the largest integer $n$ that satisfies this inequality.
