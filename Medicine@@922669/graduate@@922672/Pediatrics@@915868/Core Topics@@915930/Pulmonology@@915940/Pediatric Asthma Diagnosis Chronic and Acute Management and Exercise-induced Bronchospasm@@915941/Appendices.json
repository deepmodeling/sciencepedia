Let us denote this relative change, which represents the bronchodilator response, by the symbol $R$.\n\nFirst, we define the absolute change in $\\text{FEV1}$, which we denote as $\\Delta \\text{FEV1}$.

This gives the formula for the dimensionless fractional increase $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\Delta \\text{FEV1}}{\\text{FEV1}_{\\text{pre}}} = \\frac{\\text{FEV1}_{\\text{post}} - \\text{FEV1}_{\\text{pre}}}{\\text{FEV1}_{\\text{pre}}} $$\n\nThis derived expression is the formal mathematical representation of the bronchodilator response as a fractional increase.

The number $0.15$ has two significant figures (the digits $1$ and $5$). To express this result with four significant figures, we must add two trailing zeros after the last non-zero digit. The leading zero is not significant, but the trailing zeros after the decimal point are significant.\nTherefore, the value of $R$ expressed to four significant figures is:\n$$ R = 0.1500 $$\n\nThis value represents a $15\\%$ increase in $\\text{FEV1}$ from the baseline following the administration of the bronchodilator.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1500}$$", "id": "5181453"}, {"introduction": "Managing chronic asthma involves more than just lung function tests; it requires understanding the day-to-day impact on a child's life.
