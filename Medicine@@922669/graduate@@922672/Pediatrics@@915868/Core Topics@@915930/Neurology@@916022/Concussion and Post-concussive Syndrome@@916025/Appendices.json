This exercise [@problem_id:5123303] challenges you to apply the modern definition of concussion to two distinct scenarios, forcing a critical evaluation of the roles of loss of consciousness (LOC) and post-traumatic amnesia (PTA). Mastering this distinction is crucial for accurate diagnosis and for correctly prognosticating recovery in young athletes.", "problem": "A $14$-year-old soccer player sustains a head-to-head collision and immediately develops headache, photophobia, slowed processing, and disorientation. There is no loss of consciousness (LOC), but there is anterograde amnesia for events over the next $20$ minutes. On the sideline, vital signs are stable, cranial nerves are intact, and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is $15$. A second $14$-year-old teammate, in a separate incident the same day, falls backward, briefly loses consciousness for approximately $15$ seconds, then rapidly awakens, is fully oriented with intact recall before and after the fall, and reports only a mild headache that resolves within $1$ hour. Both children are removed from play and evaluated in clinic the next day with normal neurological examinations and no focal findings.\n\nUsing the core definition that concussion is a form of mild traumatic brain injury induced by biomechanical forces leading to a transient functional disturbance (typically without macroscopic structural injury on conventional imaging), and the well-tested observations in pediatrics that clinical diagnosis is based on the presence of compatible mechanism plus acute neurological symptoms or signs, answer the following:\n\nWhich statement best explains, from these principles, why LOC is neither necessary nor sufficient to diagnose concussion, and which clinical feature between post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) and isolated brief LOC more strongly predicts prolonged recovery and post-concussive symptoms in children?\n\nA. LOC is required to diagnose concussion because it indicates impairment of the reticular activating system; therefore, the second player clearly has a concussion and a worse prognosis, whereas amnesia without LOC is insufficient and less prognostic.\n\nB. LOC is neither necessary nor sufficient to diagnose concussion because concussion is defined by a transient functional disturbance after biomechanical force with characteristic symptoms; isolated brief LOC without ongoing symptoms may occur with minimal functional disturbance, while concussion commonly occurs without LOC. In children, the presence and duration of PTA and early symptom burden are more predictive of prolonged recovery than isolated brief LOC.\n\nC. LOC is neither necessary nor sufficient to diagnose concussion, but when present it uniformly outweighs PTA as a prognostic marker in pediatrics; therefore, the second player has the higher risk of persistent post-concussive symptoms.\n\nD. LOC is sufficient to diagnose concussion even in the absence of symptoms or signs after head impact, because any transient unresponsiveness implies diffuse brain injury; PTA is unreliable and reflects primarily attention or effort rather than injury severity.\n\nE. The absence of LOC effectively rules out concussion; when amnesia occurs in the absence of LOC in youth it most often reflects psychological factors rather than brain dysfunction and therefore does not predict recovery.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific and logical integrity.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n\n**Case 1 (Player 1):**\n- Age: $14$ years old\n- Mechanism: Head-to-head collision\n- Immediate Symptoms: headache, photophobia, slowed processing, disorientation\n- Loss of Consciousness (LOC): No LOC.\n- Post-Traumatic Amnesia (PTA): Anterograde amnesia for events over the next $20$ minutes.\n- Sideline Examination: Stable vital signs, intact cranial nerves, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is $15$.\n- Follow-up (next day): Normal neurological examination, no focal findings.\n\n**Case 2 (Player 2):**\n- Age: $14$ years old\n- Mechanism: Falls backward\n- LOC: Brief LOC for approximately $15$ seconds.\n- Post-LOC state: Rapidly awakens, fully oriented.\n- Recall: Intact recall before and after the fall (implying no significant PTA).\n- Symptoms: Mild headache that resolves within $1$ hour.\n- Follow-up (next day): Normal neurological examination, no focal findings.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n1.  **Definition of Concussion:** A form of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) induced by biomechanical forces leading to a transient functional disturbance, typically without macroscopic structural injury on conventional imaging.\n2.  **Pediatric Diagnostic Principle:** Clinical diagnosis is based on the presence of a compatible mechanism plus acute neurological symptoms or signs.\n3.  **Implicit Information:** The question directs the use of \"well-tested observations in pediatrics\" to determine the relative prognostic value of different clinical features.\n\n**Question:**\nWhich statement best explains why LOC is neither necessary nor sufficient to diagnose concussion, and which clinical feature (PTA vs. isolated brief LOC) more strongly predicts prolonged recovery and post-concussive symptoms in children?\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in contemporary clinical neurology and sports medicine. The definition of concussion provided is consistent with consensus statements from major international bodies (e.g., the Concussion in Sport Group). The clinical scenarios are classic and realistic representations of sports-related head injuries in adolescents. The symptoms (headache, photophobia), signs (amnesia, disorientation, LOC), and examination findings (GCS $15$) are all standard elements in the evaluation of mTBI. The problem adheres to established scientific principles.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides two distinct clinical cases that illustrate the key concepts in question. It gives a clear definition and diagnostic principle to work from. The question is specific, asking for an explanation regarding the role of LOC and a comparison of the prognostic value of PTA and LOC. This structure allows for a unique, best answer to be determined based on the provided principles and established medical knowledge.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is clinical, precise, and free of bias or subjective claims. The scenarios are presented as factual case reports.\n\n**Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no internal contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n**Derivation of Principles and Solution**\n\nThe core of the problem requires analyzing the provided case vignettes through the lens of the given definition of concussion and established pediatric prognostic factors.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Concussion Definition and Diagnosis:**\n    - The definition states concussion is a \"transient functional disturbance\" following a biomechanical force.\n    - The diagnostic principle requires a \"compatible mechanism\" and \"acute neurological symptoms or signs.\"\n    - **Player 1** experienced a compatible mechanism (head-to-head collision) and developed a constellation of acute neurological symptoms (headache, photophobia, slowed processing, disorientation) and a sign (anterograde amnesia for $20$ minutes). Thus, Player $1$ unequivocally meets the criteria for a concussion diagnosis. Notably, this occurred **without** LOC. This single case demonstrates that **LOC is not a necessary condition** for diagnosing concussion.\n    - **Player 2** experienced a compatible mechanism (fall) and a clear neurological sign (LOC for $15$ seconds). This also meets the technical definition of a concussion. However, the subsequent rapid recovery, full orientation, lack of amnesia, and only a mild, rapidly resolving headache suggest a very minimal and transient functional disturbance compared to Player $1$.\n\n2.  **Analysis of \"Neither Necessary Nor Sufficient\":**\n    - **Not Necessary:** As established by Player $1$, a clear and clinically significant concussion can occur without any LOC. This aligns with extensive epidemiological data showing that the vast majority (>$90\\%$) of sports-related concussions do not involve LOC.\n    - **Not Sufficient:** The concept of sufficiency relates to whether the presence of a sign (LOC) is enough, by itself, to define the entirety of the clinical picture, particularly severity and prognosis. Player $2$ had a brief LOC but a very mild clinical course. Player $1$ had no LOC but a more complex symptom cluster and significant PTA, suggesting a more substantial functional disturbance. Comparing the two, the simple presence of LOC in Player $2$ is not sufficient to classify their injury as more severe than Player $1$'s. Therefore, LOC is not a sufficient marker for determining injury severity or prognosis; other factors, such as the number and severity of symptoms and the presence of PTA, are required for a complete assessment. This demonstrates that **LOC is not a sufficient condition** for determining the clinical severity or prognosis.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Prognostic Factors (PTA vs. LOC):**\n    - The question asks which feature more strongly predicts prolonged recovery, referencing \"well-tested observations in pediatrics.\"\n    - Clinical research on concussion outcomes has consistently identified several key predictors of prolonged recovery (i.e., recovery taking longer than the typical $2-4$ weeks). The strongest predictors include:\n        - High initial symptom burden (the number and severity of symptoms on assessment tools like the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale).\n        - The presence of specific symptoms, such as dizziness/vestibular-ocular dysfunction and cognitive fogginess.\n        - The presence and, particularly, the duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA).\n    - In contrast, a brief LOC (typically defined as less than $1$ minute) has been shown in multiple large-scale studies to be a poor predictor of recovery time in both adults and children. While a prolonged LOC is associated with more severe TBI, an isolated, brief LOC is not a reliable prognostic marker for post-concussive outcomes.\n    - In the given scenarios, Player $1$'s presentation includes multiple symptoms and a significant period of PTA ($20$ minutes). Player $2$'s presentation is dominated by an isolated, brief LOC. Based on established evidence, Player $1$'s clinical features (PTA and symptom cluster) are more predictive of a potentially prolonged recovery course than Player $2$'s isolated, brief LOC.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n- **A. LOC is required to diagnose concussion because it indicates impairment of the reticular activating system; therefore, the second player clearly has a concussion and a worse prognosis, whereas amnesia without LOC is insufficient and less prognostic.**\n  - This statement is fundamentally flawed. It incorrectly claims LOC is required, directly contradicting the example of Player $1$ and modern medical consensus. It also incorrectly concludes that Player $2$ has a worse prognosis and that amnesia without LOC is \"insufficient and less prognostic,\" which is the opposite of established evidence.\n  - **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n- **B. LOC is neither necessary nor sufficient to diagnose concussion because concussion is defined by a transient functional disturbance after biomechanical force with characteristic symptoms; isolated brief LOC without ongoing symptoms may occur with minimal functional disturbance, while concussion commonly occurs without LOC. In children, the presence and duration of PTA and early symptom burden are more predictive of prolonged recovery than isolated brief LOC.**\n  - This statement is entirely accurate. It correctly states LOC is neither necessary (as per Player $1$) nor sufficient (as a sole marker of severity). It accurately reflects the definition of concussion as a functional disturbance. Most importantly, it correctly identifies that PTA and symptom burden are stronger prognostic indicators in pediatrics than an isolated, brief LOC. This aligns perfectly with the derivation from first principles and known clinical science.\n  - **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n- **C. LOC is neither necessary nor sufficient to diagnose concussion, but when present it uniformly outweighs PTA as a prognostic marker in pediatrics; therefore, the second player has the higher risk of persistent post-concussive symptoms.**\n  - The first clause (\"neither necessary nor sufficient\") is correct. However, the second clause (\"it uniformly outweighs PTA as a prognostic marker\") is factually incorrect. As discussed, evidence points to PTA and symptom burden as stronger predictors than brief LOC. The conclusion that Player $2$ has a higher risk is therefore unfounded.\n  - **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n- **D. LOC is sufficient to diagnose concussion even in the absence of symptoms or signs after head impact, because any transient unresponsiveness implies diffuse brain injury; PTA is unreliable and reflects primarily attention or effort rather than injury severity.**\n  - This statement contains multiple errors. It incorrectly dismisses the importance of other symptoms and signs. Critically, it makes the false claim that PTA is \"unreliable\" and a reflection of \"effort.\" PTA is a cardinal sign of neurologic dysfunction and a key prognostic indicator in TBI.\n  - **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n- **E. The absence of LOC effectively rules out concussion; when amnesia occurs in the absence of LOC in youth it most often reflects psychological factors rather than brain dysfunction and therefore does not predict recovery.**\n  - This statement is dangerously wrong. It incorrectly claims the absence of LOC rules out concussion, which is false. It further makes the baseless assertion that amnesia without LOC is likely psychological. Post-traumatic amnesia following a biomechanical impact is a clear sign of brain dysfunction.\n  - **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5123303"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis is made and symptoms persist, the focus shifts to active rehabilitation.

The Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test (BCTT) is a validated tool for identifying the heart rate threshold at which symptoms are exacerbated in individuals with PCS. Prescribing subsymptom threshold aerobic exercise, typically at $80\\%$ to $90\\%$ of this threshold, is a standard and effective intervention. The relationship between heart rate and workload is a fundamental concept in exercise physiology. The principles for the progressive training plan (symptom-gated progression, advancing duration before intensity) are cornerstones of graded exposure therapy and safe rehabilitation. The problem is scientifically grounded and clinically realistic.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data for the required calculation. The constraints for the descriptive part of the solution are clear, consistent, and sufficient to formulate a unique type of plan.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise and uses standard clinical and physiological terminology, free from subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Training Heart Rate**\n\nThe target training heart rate, denoted as $HR_{train}$, is calculated as a fixed fraction of the symptom-limited threshold heart rate, $HR_{thresh}$.\n\nThe given variables are:\n- The symptom-limited threshold heart rate, $HR_{thresh} = 150\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$.\n- The prescribed training intensity factor, $f = 0.80$.\n\nThe formula for the training heart rate is:\n$$HR_{train} = f \\times HR_{thresh}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\n$$HR_{train} = 0.80 \\times 150\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$$\n$$HR_{train} = 120\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $120$. To explicitly denote three significant figures, this can be expressed as $1.20 \\times 10^{2}$. The integer $120$ is the correct representation for the final answer.\n\n**Part 2: Outline of a Safe, Progressive $3$-Week Aerobic Training Plan**\n\nThe plan must adhere to the four specified constraints. The goal is to gradually increase the patient's tolerance for physical activity without provoking concussive symptoms, promoting physiological adaptation and recovery. The intensity is held constant at the calculated $HR_{train}$, and progression is achieved by increasing the duration of exercise.\n\n**Target Heart Rate:** $\\leq 120\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$.\n**Modality:** Low-impact aerobic exercise (e.g., stationary cycling, elliptical trainer, or brisk walking on a treadmill).\n**Monitoring:** A heart rate monitor must be used to ensure the target HR is not exceeded. Symptoms are rated on a $0$–$10$ numeric rating scale (NRS) before, immediately after, and one hour after each session.\n\n**Progression Rule:** The duration of exercise is increased only if the previous step is completed on consecutive training days without an increase in symptom score of $\\geq 2$ points from the pre-exercise baseline. If symptoms are exacerbated, the patient returns to the last well-tolerated duration for the subsequent session.\n\n**Week 1: Establishing Baseline Tolerance**\nThe initial goal is to establish a consistent, symptom-free baseline of activity. A common starting duration is $20$ minutes.\n- **Schedule:** $5$ days of exercise, $2$ rest days.\n- **Daily Session:** $20$ minutes of continuous aerobic exercise.\n- **Intensity:** Maintain a steady heart rate at or just below $120\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$.\n- **Progression Check:** At the end of Week $1$, an assessment is made. If all $5$ sessions were tolerated (symptom increase $< 2$ points), the patient is ready to progress.\n\n**Week 2: Progression of Duration**\nIf Week $1$ was successful, the training load is increased by extending the duration. A typical, safe increment is $5$ minutes.\n- **Schedule:** $5$ days of exercise, $2$ rest days.\n- **Daily Session:** $25$ minutes of continuous aerobic exercise.\n- **Intensity:** Maintain a steady heart rate at or just below $120\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$.\n- **Progression Check:** If a session provokes symptoms (increase $\\geq 2$ points), the next session reverts to the Week $1$ duration of $20$ minutes. The patient must again complete a session at $20$ minutes without symptom exacerbation before re-attempting $25$ minutes. If all sessions at $25$ minutes are tolerated, the patient is ready for the next progression.\n\n**Week 3: Continued Progression of Duration**\nIf Week $2$ was successful, the duration is increased again.\n- **Schedule:** $5$ days of exercise, $2$ rest days.\n- **Daily Session:** $30$ minutes of continuous aerobic exercise.\n- **Intensity:** Maintain a steady heart rate at or just below $120\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$.\n- **Progression Check:** The same symptom-gating rules apply. If symptoms are exacerbated, the patient returns to the Week $2$ duration of $25$ minutes.\n\nThis structured plan systematically applies the principles of graded exposure, using duration as the primary variable for progression while maintaining a constant, subsymptom physiological intensity defined by heart rate. The inclusion of mandatory rest days and a strict symptom-gating rule ensures safety and maximizes the therapeutic effect of the intervention.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{120}\n$$", "id": "5123201"}, {"introduction": "The symptoms of concussion can overlap with or unmask other conditions, and a key role for the clinician is to identify these specific syndromes.

She has no prior cardiovascular disease. Medications are limited to acetaminophen as needed.

It asks for a specific calculation (the diagnostic margin) and provides all necessary data to perform it, with one exception. It does not explicitly state the heart rate threshold for adolescent POTS. However, it refers to it as a \"well-tested clinical criterion,\" which implies it is a standard, verifiable value used in the field. For a problem in an applied science like medicine, expecting knowledge of such a key diagnostic number is standard.

The requirement to know a standard clinical threshold is acceptable for a specialized problem. A complete solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe task is to determine if the patient meets the criteria for POTS, compute the diagnostic margin for the heart rate, and outline a management plan.\n\n**1. Assessment Against POTS Diagnostic Criteria**\n\nThe diagnosis of POTS requires the presence of three key features:\nI. Symptoms of orthostatic intolerance.\nII. Absence of orthostatic hypotension (OH).\nIII. An excessive and sustained increase in heart rate on standing.\n\nLet us evaluate the patient's data against each criterion.\n\n**I. Symptoms of Orthostatic Intolerance:**\nThe problem statement explicitly notes the patient \"endorses orthostatic intolerance symptoms (lightheadedness, palpitations, cognitive clouding) during standing that improve on lying down.\" This criterion is met.\n\n**II. Absence of Orthostatic Hypotension (OH):**\nOH is defined as a sustained drop of $\\ge 20\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ in systolic BP or $\\ge 10\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ in diastolic BP. We will compare the supine BP to the standing BP. The standing BP is stable at $108/70\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ from $1$ minute to $10$ minutes, so it is sustained.\n\n- Systolic Blood Pressure Change ($\\Delta BP_{sys}$):\n$$ \\Delta BP_{sys} = BP_{sys, supine} - BP_{sys, stand} = 110\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} - 108\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} = 2\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} $$\nA drop of $2\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ is less than the required threshold of $20\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\n- Diastolic Blood Pressure Change ($\\Delta BP_{dia}$):\n$$ \\Delta BP_{dia} = BP_{dia, supine} - BP_{dia, stand} = 70\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} - 70\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} $$\nA drop of $0\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ is less than the required threshold of $10\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\nSince neither the systolic nor the diastolic blood pressure drop meets the criteria for OH, the patient does not have orthostatic hypotension. This criterion for POTS diagnosis is met.\n\n**III. Excessive Heart Rate Increase:**\nThe standard diagnostic threshold for POTS in adolescents (age $< 19$ years) is a sustained heart rate increase ($\\Delta HR$) of $\\ge 40\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$ within $10$ minutes of standing. Let's calculate the patient's maximum heart rate increase.\n\n- Supine Heart Rate ($HR_{supine}$): $75\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$.\n- Maximum Standing Heart Rate within $10$ minutes ($HR_{stand, max}$): The highest recorded value is $120\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$ at the $10$-minute mark.\n\nThe heart rate increase is:\n$$ \\Delta HR = HR_{stand, max} - HR_{supine} = 120\\,\\mathrm{bpm} - 75\\,\\mathrm{bpm} = 45\\,\\mathrm{bpm} $$\nThe patient's heart rate increase of $45\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$ is greater than or equal to the diagnostic threshold of $40\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$ ($45\\,\\mathrm{bpm} \\ge 40\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$). This criterion is met.\n\n**Conclusion of Diagnosis:** The patient meets all three criteria for a diagnosis of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Diagnostic Margin**\n\nThe problem asks for the \"numeric diagnostic margin relative to the adolescent heart rate threshold for POTS.\" This is the difference between the patient's measured heart rate increase and the minimum threshold for diagnosis.\n\n- Patient's Heart Rate Increase ($\\Delta HR_{patient}$): $45\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$\n- Adolescent POTS Threshold ($\\Delta HR_{threshold}$): $40\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$\n\nThe diagnostic margin is:\n$$ \\text{Margin} = \\Delta HR_{patient} - \\Delta HR_{threshold} = 45\\,\\mathrm{bpm} - 40\\,\\mathrm{bpm} = 5\\,\\mathrm{bpm} $$\n\nThe margin is $5\\,\\mathrm{bpm}$.\n\n**3. Stepwise Management Plan**\n\nAlthough not part of the final numerical answer, the reasoning requires outlining a management plan grounded in pediatric concussion and autonomic rehabilitation principles.\n\n- **Step 1: Education and Validation.** The patient and her family should be educated about the diagnosis of POTS, its common association with concussion (as a form of secondary dysautonomia), and its typically favorable prognosis with treatment. Validating her symptoms as physiological and not \"in her head\" is a critical first step.\n\n- **Step 2: Non-Pharmacologic Interventions (First-Line).** This is the cornerstone of management.\n  - **Volume Expansion:** Increase daily fluid intake to $2-3$ liters and sodium intake to $3-5$ grams, provided there are no contraindications like hypertension or renal disease. This increases intravascular volume.\n  - **Graded Exercise Program:** A structured, progressive exercise protocol is essential for autonomic rehabilitation. It must begin with non-upright exercises (e.g., recumbent bicycle, swimming, rowing) to improve cardiac conditioning without orthostatic stress. As tolerated, the program slowly re-introduces upright activities.\n  - **Physical Counter-maneuvers:** Teach the patient to perform isometric exercises (e.g., leg crossing, gluteal and thigh muscle clenching) upon the first sensation of lightheadedness to increase venous return and cardiac output.\n  - **Compression Garments:** Recommend waist-high compression stockings ($20-30\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$) and/or an abdominal binder to reduce venous pooling in the lower extremities and splanchnic circulation.\n  - **School Accommodations:** Provide documentation to the school to arrange for accommodations such as unlimited access to water, permission to stand and move during class, and a modified physical education plan consistent with the graded exercise program.\n\n- **Step 3: Pharmacologic Interventions (Second-Line).** If symptoms remain debilitating after a consistent trial of non-pharmacologic measures (e.g., $2-3$ months), medication may be considered.\n  - **Fludrocortisone:** A mineralocorticoid that promotes sodium and water retention, increasing blood volume. Requires monitoring of blood pressure and electrolytes.\n  - **Midodrine:** An alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that constricts blood vessels, increasing venous return. It is short-acting and must be dosed during the patient's active hours.\n  - **Low-dose beta-blockers** (e.g., propranolol): May be useful in hyperadrenergic subtypes to control tachycardia, but can worsen fatigue and must be used cautiously.\n\n- **Step 4: Multidisciplinary Follow-up.** Regular follow-up with the primary physician or a specialist (e.g., cardiologist, neurologist) is necessary to monitor progress, adjust treatment, and guide the patient's return to academics and sports.\n\nThe final answer required is solely the numeric diagnostic margin.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{5}\n$$", "id": "5123259"}]}
