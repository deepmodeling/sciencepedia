It describes a standard, realistic scenario in pediatric emergency medicine. All data required for a unique, meaningful solution are provided, and the constraints are consistent with established clinical practice.\n\nThe core task is to determine the most appropriate volume of epinephrine to administer to a child experiencing anaphylaxis, given a weight-based dosing guideline and a limited choice of fixed-dose delivery devices. The derivation proceeds in three stages: first, calculating the ideal drug mass; second, selecting the best-fit available discrete dose; and third, converting that selected mass into a volume using the provided solution concentration.\n\nLet $m$ represent the child's body mass, $D_r$ be the recommended weight-based dose, and $M_{ideal}$ be the ideal mass of epinephrine to be administered. The problem provides:\n- Child's body mass, $m = 18 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- Dosing principle, $D_r = 0.01 \\ \\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}$\n\nThe ideal mass of epinephrine is calculated by multiplying the child's mass by the dosing principle:\n$$M_{ideal} = m \\times D_r$$\n$$M_{ideal} = 18 \\ \\mathrm{kg} \\times 0.01 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg}} = 0.18 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThe available administration devices are fixed-dose autoinjectors, which deliver discrete amounts of epinephrine. The available doses are:\n- $d_1 = 0.15 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$\n- $d_2 = 0.30 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$\n\nTo select the appropriate device, we must determine which of these fixed doses is the best approximation of the calculated ideal dose, $M_{ideal} = 0.18 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$. This is achieved by comparing the absolute differences between the ideal dose and each available discrete dose.\n\nLet $\\Delta_1$ be the absolute difference between the ideal dose and the first available dose, $d_1$:\n$$\\Delta_1 = |M_{ideal} - d_1| = |0.18 \\ \\mathrm{mg} - 0.15 \\ \\mathrm{mg}| = 0.03 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nLet $\\Delta_2$ be the absolute difference between the ideal dose and the second available dose, $d_2$:\n$$\\Delta_2 = |M_{ideal} - d_2| = |0.18 \\ \\mathrm{mg} - 0.30 \\ \\mathrm{mg}| = |-0.12 \\ \\mathrm{mg}| = 0.12 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nBy comparing the magnitudes of these differences, we see that $\\Delta_1  \\Delta_2$, since $0.03  0.12$.

This choice aligns with established pediatric practice, where the $0.15 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$ autoinjector is typically recommended for children in the approximate weight range of $15 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$ to $30 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$. The mass of epinephrine to be administered, $M_{admin}$, is thus selected to be:\n$$M_{admin} = 0.15 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThe final step is to calculate the volume of solution that contains this mass of epinephrine. Let $C$ be the concentration of the epinephrine solution and $V_{delivered}$ be the volume to be delivered. The problem provides:\n- Solution concentration, $C = 1 \\ \\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{mL}$\n\nThe relationship between mass, concentration, and volume is given by $M = C \\times V$, which can be rearranged to solve for the volume:\n$$V_{delivered} = \\frac{M_{admin}}{C}$$\nSubstituting the selected dose and the given concentration:\n$$V_{delivered} = \\frac{0.15 \\ \\mathrm{mg}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{mL}} = 0.15 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThus, the appropriate delivered volume, corresponding to the correctly selected fixed-dose autoinjector, is $0.15 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.15}$$", "id": "5144514"}, {"introduction": "The long-term management of food allergies extends far beyond simple avoidance of the trigger food; it crucially involves ensuring the child receives adequate nutrition for healthy growth and development.
