The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe goal is to compute the post-test probability of having SLE given a positive test result. This requires the application of Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $D$: The event that the child has SLE.\n- $D^c$: The event that the child does not have SLE.\n- $T^+$: The event that the anti-dsDNA test is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the anti-dsDNA test is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we can formalize the given information in terms of probabilities:\n- The pretest probability of having SLE is $P(D) = 0.20$.\n- The probability of not having SLE is the complement, $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n\nThe sensitivity of a test is the probability of a positive test result given that the subject has the disease.\n- Sensitivity = $P(T^+ | D) = 0.60$.\n\nThe specificity of a test is the probability of a negative test result given that the subject does not have the disease.\n- Specificity = $P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95$.\n\nWe are asked to find the post-test probability of having SLE given a positive test result, which is the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, this probability is given by:\n$$ P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\n\nThe numerator, $P(T^+ | D) P(D)$, represents the probability of a true positive result. We can calculate this directly from the givens:\n$$ P(T^+ | D) P(D) = (0.60) \\times (0.20) = 0.12 $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. This can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: either the child has SLE and tests positive (a true positive), or the child does not have SLE and tests positive (a false positive). We can express $P(T^+)$ using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\n\nWe have the first term, $P(T^+ | D) P(D) = 0.12$. We need to find the second term, which requires $P(T^+ | D^c)$. This term is the probability of a positive test given the absence of the disease, also known as the false positive rate. It is the complement of the specificity:\n$$ P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\n\nNow we can calculate the probability of a false positive result:\n$$ P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) = (0.05) \\times (0.80) = 0.04 $$\n\nSubstituting these values back into the formula for the total probability of a positive test:\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.12 + 0.04 = 0.16 $$\n\nFinally, we can compute the post-test probability $P(D | T^+)$ using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{0.12}{0.16} $$\n$$ P(D | T^+) = \\frac{12}{16} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75 $$\n\nThe post-test probability that the child has SLE given the positive anti-dsDNA result is $0.75$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.75}$$", "id": "5209418"}, {"introduction": "Lupus nephritis is one of the most severe manifestations of childhood-onset SLE, and its management requires the synthesis of complex clinical, laboratory, and histopathological data.

All clinical signs (edema, hypertension), laboratory values (nephrotic-range proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, reduced eGFR, active urinary sediment), and pathological findings (proliferative lesions, crescents, full-house immunofluorescence, subendothelial deposits) are scientifically accurate and standard representations of the disease. The ISN/RPS classification is the current gold standard. The therapeutic options presented are all established treatments. The problem is firmly grounded in established principles of nephrology, pathology, and pediatrics.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides sufficient quantitative and qualitative data to arrive at a specific pathological classification using the specified ISN/RPS framework. Based on this classification and the severity of the findings, a standard-of-care treatment can be selected from the options. The prompt asks for the single best option, implying a unique solution based on current clinical guidelines.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, clinical terms. The data points are quantitative or use standard, universally understood pathological descriptors. There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The pathological data are internally consistent and sufficient for classification.\n    - **Involvement:** $18$ of $24$ glomeruli are involved, which is $75\\%$. Since $75\\% \\ge 50\\%$, this meets the criterion for diffuse LN (Class IV).\n    - **Global vs. Segmental:** Of the $18$ involved glomeruli, $12$ show global lesions. This is $12/18 = 66.7\\%$ of the involved glomeruli. Since $66.7\\% \\ge 50\\%$, the subtype is global, or IV-G.\n    - **Activity:** The presence of endocapillary hypercellularity, cellular crescents, and subendothelial deposits (\"wire loops\") with minimal chronicity defines an active lesion, designated as (A).\n    - **Crescent Formation:** Cellular crescents are present in $14$ of $24$ glomeruli, which is approximately $58.3\\%$. The presence of crescents in over $50\\%$ of glomeruli signifies a particularly severe, rapidly progressive form of glomerulonephritis (RPGN).\n    - The clinical picture of acute kidney injury (eGFR $45$), nephrotic-range proteinuria ($3.1$ g/g corresponds to nephrotic syndrome), hypoalbuminemia, and active urinary sediment (RBC casts) is entirely consistent with the severe pathological findings.\n5.  **Realism:** The case is a realistic, albeit severe, presentation of pediatric LN. The values and findings are plausible within a clinical context.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a challenging but solvable clinical case based on established medical knowledge. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Pathological Classification\nBased on the ISN/RPS 2003 classification system:\n1.  The presence of immune complex deposition in the glomeruli confirms lupus nephritis. The \"full-house\" IF pattern is classic for LN. The prominent subendothelial deposits on EM (which correspond to the \"wire loops\" on light microscopy) are characteristic of proliferative forms of LN.\n2.  The percentage of involved glomeruli determines the class. Here, $18$ out of $24$ glomeruli are affected, which is $75\\%$. Since this is $\\ge 50\\%$, the diagnosis is **Class IV Lupus Nephritis (Diffuse Proliferative Lupus Nephritis)**.\n3.  Class IV LN is sub-classified based on whether the lesions are predominantly segmental (S) or global (G). A lesion is global if it involves more than half of the glomerular tuft. Here, $12$ of the $18$ involved glomeruli have global lesions ($66.7\\%$). Since $\\ge 50\\%$ of involved glomeruli have global lesions, the sub-classification is **IV-G**.\n4.  Active (A) and chronic (C) lesions are also specified. The findings of endocapillary hypercellularity, cellular crescents, and wire loops (subendothelial deposits), combined with the statement that \"chronicity features... are minimal,\" lead to the designation of an active lesion, **(A)**.\n5.  The presence of cellular crescents in $14$ of $24$ glomeruli ($58.3\\%$) is a critical descriptor of severity, indicating a diagnosis of crescentic glomerulonephritis and implying a rapidly progressive clinical course.\n\nTherefore, the full pathological diagnosis is **ISN/RPS Class IV-G (A) Lupus Nephritis**, with extensive crescent formation.\n\n### Selection of Induction Therapy\nThe patient has a life- and kidney-threatening manifestation of SLE. The goals of induction therapy are to rapidly suppress inflammation, halt the decline in kidney function, and induce remission to prevent irreversible scarring (chronicity).\n- **Corticosteroids:** High-dose corticosteroids are a mandatory component of induction therapy for any severe LN. This typically begins with intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone pulses for $1-3$ days, followed by a high-dose oral corticosteroid (e.g., prednisone) that is gradually tapered over several months.\n- **Second Agent:** Corticosteroids alone are insufficient. They must be combined with another potent immunosuppressive agent. For severe Class IV LN, the primary choices are cyclophosphamide (CYC) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).\n    - **MMF:** Has been shown to be non-inferior to IV CYC for induction therapy and is often favored due to a better long-term safety profile, particularly regarding gonadal toxicity. It is a valid first-line choice for most patients with Class III/IV LN.\n    - **CYC:** A potent alkylating agent that has historically been the gold standard. For the most severe presentations—specifically, cases with rapidly declining GFR and extensive crescent formation (as seen here, with eGFR of $45$ and $58.3\\%$ crescents)—many experts and guidelines favor CYC for its rapid and powerful immunosuppressive effect. The \"Euro-Lupus\" protocol, which uses a lower cumulative dose of IV CYC ($500$ mg every $2$ weeks for $6$ doses), has demonstrated comparable efficacy to higher-dose regimens but with significantly less toxicity, making it an attractive choice, especially in young patients where fertility preservation is a concern.\n- **Ancillary Care:**\n    - **Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ):** Recommended for all patients with SLE, as it reduces flares and improves long-term outcomes.\n    - **RAS Blockade:** An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is indicated to manage hypertension and reduce proteinuria, which are both present in this patient.\n\nGiven the extreme severity—diffuse proliferative and global lesions, an eGFR of $45$ mL/min/$1.73$ m$^2$, and crescents in over half the glomeruli—the most aggressive and rapidly acting induction regimen is warranted. The use of cyclophosphamide is strongly indicated in this specific context.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. ISN/RPS Class IV-G (A) diffuse proliferative LN; induction with high-dose intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone pulses followed by oral corticosteroid taper plus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) at approximately $600$ mg/m$^2$ twice daily; add hydroxychloroquine and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker.**\n- **Pathology:** The classification of ISN/RPS Class IV-G (A) is correct.\n- **Therapy:** This regimen (steroids + MMF + ancillary care) is a standard and effective induction therapy for Class IV LN. However, for a patient with such severe, rapidly progressive features (eGFR $45$, >$50\\%$ crescents), some authorities would argue for the more potent and rapidly acting cyclophosphamide. While a reasonable option, it may not be the *single best* choice for this extreme presentation.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect. While plausible, it is likely suboptimal compared to a cyclophosphamide-based regimen for this specific high-severity case.\n\n**B. ISN/RPS Class II mesangial LN; induction with low-dose oral corticosteroids alone and hydroxychloroquine; defer renin-angiotensin system blockade until remission.**\n- **Pathology:** The classification of Class II is incorrect. The biopsy clearly shows diffuse proliferative disease (Class IV).\n- **Therapy:** The proposed therapy is grossly inadequate for the disease severity. Deferring RAS blockade is also incorrect.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. ISN/RPS Class V membranous LN; induction with calcineurin inhibitor monotherapy and gradual steroid taper; avoid cytotoxic agents given crescents are uncommon in membranous disease.**\n- **Pathology:** The classification of Class V is incorrect. The primary lesion is proliferative (Class IV), characterized by subendothelial, not subepithelial, deposits.\n- **Therapy:** This therapy is inappropriate. Avoiding cytotoxic agents in the face of severe proliferative and crescentic disease would be a critical error.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. ISN/RPS Class III focal proliferative LN; induction with azathioprine plus low-dose corticosteroids; reserve cyclophosphamide for nonresponders.**\n- **Pathology:** The classification of Class III is incorrect. Involvement of $75\\%$ of glomeruli defines Class IV.\n- **Therapy:** Azathioprine is primarily a maintenance agent, not an induction agent for severe LN. This regimen would be insufficient.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. ISN/RPS Class IV-G (A) diffuse proliferative LN with rapidly progressive features; induction with high-dose corticosteroids (e.g., IV methylprednisolone pulses followed by oral taper) plus low-dose IV cyclophosphamide per “Euro-Lupus” protocol (e.g., $500$ mg every $2$ weeks for $6$ doses), together with hydroxychloroquine and ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker.**\n- **Pathology:** The classification as Class IV-G (A) is correct. Critically, it also acknowledges the \"rapidly progressive features,\" which correspond to the extensive crescents and acute decline in GFR.\n- **Therapy:** This is an optimal therapeutic choice. It combines high-dose steroids with a potent second agent, cyclophosphamide, which is favored for the most severe cases. The use of the \"Euro-Lupus\" protocol provides this potency while mitigating long-term toxicity, a crucial consideration for a $13$-year-old. The inclusion of appropriate ancillary care (HCQ and RAS blockade) is also correct. This regimen directly addresses the severity and rapidity of the disease process.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "5209265"}, {"introduction": "After controlling acute disease flares, the focus of cSLE management shifts to long-term maintenance and harm prevention.

It presents a standard clinical pharmacology calculation based on established, evidence-based toxicological limits. All necessary data are provided to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe primary principle governing the long-term dosing of hydroxychloroquine is the minimization of the risk of irreversible retinopathy. Clinical guidelines, most notably from the American Academy of Ophthalmology, have established that this risk is correlated with the cumulative dose and the daily dose relative to body weight. The current recommendation is to keep the daily dose of hydroxychloroquine at or below $5.0$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ per $\\mathrm{kg}$ of actual body weight, where the dose is measured in terms of hydroxychloroquine **base**.\n\nFirst, we define the given parameters:\n- Patient's actual body weight, $W = 45$ $\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- Maximum recommended daily dose limit, $D_{\\text{limit}} = 5.0$ $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ (of hydroxychloroquine base).\n- Labeled tablet strength = $200$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ (of hydroxychloroquine sulfate).\n- Hydroxychloroquine base content per tablet = $155$ $\\mathrm{mg}$.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the maximum permissible daily dose in terms of hydroxychloroquine base for this patient.\nLet $M_{\\text{base}}$ be this maximum daily base dose.\n$$M_{\\text{base}} = D_{\\text{limit}} \\times W$$\n$$M_{\\text{base}} = 5.0 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg}} \\times 45 \\, \\mathrm{kg} = 225 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$$\nThus, the patient should not receive more than $225$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ of hydroxychloroquine base per day.\n\nNext, we must determine the corresponding maximum dose in terms of hydroxychloroquine sulfate, as this is the form supplied in tablets. The problem states that a $200$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ sulfate tablet contains $155$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ of base. The conversion factor, $F$, from base to sulfate is:\n$$F = \\frac{\\text{mass of sulfate}}{\\text{mass of base}} = \\frac{200 \\, \\mathrm{mg}}{155 \\, \\mathrm{mg}}$$\nLet $M_{\\text{sulfate}}$ be the maximum permissible daily dose in terms of hydroxychloroquine sulfate.\n$$M_{\\text{sulfate}} = M_{\\text{base}} \\times F = 225 \\, \\mathrm{mg} \\times \\frac{200}{155}$$\n$$M_{\\text{sulfate}} = \\frac{45000}{155} \\, \\mathrm{mg} = \\frac{9000}{31} \\, \\mathrm{mg} \\approx 290.32 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$$\nThis value, approximately $290.32$ $\\mathrm{mg}$, represents the absolute theoretical maximum daily dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate for this patient.\n\nHowever, the dosing is constrained to whole tablets, each containing $200$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ of hydroxychloroquine sulfate. We must find the number of whole tablets, $N$, that provides the highest possible dose without exceeding $M_{\\text{sulfate}}$.\n$$N \\times 200 \\, \\mathrm{mg} \\leq M_{\\text{sulfate}} \\approx 290.32 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$$\n$$N \\leq \\frac{290.32}{200} \\approx 1.4516$$\nSince $N$ must be an integer, the maximum number of tablets that can be administered daily is $\\lfloor 1.4516 \\rfloor = 1$.\n\nAdministering two tablets would result in a daily dose of $2 \\times 200 \\, \\mathrm{mg} = 400 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$ of hydroxychloroquine sulfate. This dose is significantly above the calculated maximum permissible dose of $290.32$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ and would place the patient at an unnecessarily increased risk of retinal toxicity.\n\nTherefore, the maximum safe daily dose that can be administered using whole tablets is the dose provided by one tablet.\n$$D_{\\text{final}} = 1 \\times 200 \\, \\mathrm{mg} = 200 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$$\nThis dose of $200$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ of hydroxychloroquine sulfate corresponds to $155$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ of hydroxychloroquine base, which is safely below the patient's individual limit of $225$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ of base per day.

Severe hepatic disease can alter drug metabolism. Dose adjustments or cessation may be required.\n3.  **Concomitant Medications:** The use of other drugs with known retinal toxicity, such as tamoxifen, substantially increases the risk and would argue against any dose escalation.\n4.  **Ophthalmologic Monitoring:** The appearance of early signs of toxicity on routine screening—such as changes on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), visual field testing, or fundus autofluorescence imaging—is an absolute contraindication to increasing the dose and typically mandates immediate cessation of the drug.\n5.  **Extremely Low Body Weight or Comorbidities:** While the formula is based on actual body weight, extreme caution is warranted in patients at the lower end of the weight spectrum or those with multiple comorbidities that might affect drug distribution and clearance.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2.00 \\times 10^2} $$", "id": "5209248"}]}
