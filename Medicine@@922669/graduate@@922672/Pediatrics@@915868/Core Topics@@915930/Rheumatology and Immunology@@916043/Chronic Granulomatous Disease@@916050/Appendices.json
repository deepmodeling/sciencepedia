The first step, as per the established protocol, is to validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Individual:** A woman is heterozygous for a pathogenic loss-of-function variant in the `CYBB` gene.\n- **Gene and Disease:** The `CYBB` gene is located on the X chromosome, and the variant causes X-linked recessive (XLR) Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD).\n- **Assumed Principles:**\n    - (i) Mendelian segregation transmits each maternal allele with equal probability.\n    - (ii) A male conceptus inherits a single X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father.\n    - (iii) The disease has full penetrance in hemizygous males (a male inheriting the pathogenic allele will have the disease).\n    - (iv) No new (`de novo`) mutations occur.\n    - (v) Mating is random, without assortative factors.\n- **Problem Condition:** The child is known to be a son.\n- **Objective:** Determine the probability that this son will have CGD.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is scientifically grounded. X-linked inheritance of CGD due to mutations in the `CYBB` gene is a well-established fact in medical genetics. The principles listed (Mendelian segregation, sex-linked inheritance, penetrance) are fundamental concepts of human genetics. The scenario is a classic and realistic problem encountered in genetic counseling. The premises are factually correct.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information: the mother's carrier status (heterozygous), the mode of inheritance (XLR), and the condition that the offspring is male. The question is clear and unambiguous, leading to a unique and meaningful probabilistic answer.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, scientific language, free of bias or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**, and a formal solution can be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $X^N$ denote the normal (wild-type) allele of the `CYBB` gene, and let $X^c$ denote the pathogenic, loss-of-function allele that causes CGD.\n\nThe woman is stated to be heterozygous. Since the `CYBB` gene is X-linked, her genotype must be $X^N X^c$.\n\nThe father's genotype is not explicitly given, but for an X-linked trait, the father contributes a Y chromosome to a son, not an X chromosome. Therefore, the father's genotype is irrelevant to the son's phenotype for this specific X-linked trait.\n\nAccording to Principle (i), Mendelian segregation, the heterozygous mother ($X^N X^c$) produces two types of gametes (ova) with equal probability.\n- The probability of a gamete containing the normal allele, $X^N$, is $P(\\text{ovum is } X^N) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- The probability of a gamete containing the pathogenic allele, $X^c$, is $P(\\text{ovum is } X^c) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nAccording to Principle (ii), a son is conceived when a sperm carrying a Y chromosome fertilizes an ovum. The problem specifies that we are conditioning on the event that the child is a son. This means we are only considering outcomes where the paternal gamete is a Y chromosome.\n\nA son's genotype is determined entirely by the X chromosome he inherits from his mother. There are two possibilities for the son's genotype, each dependent on which of the mother's X chromosomes he inherits:\n1.  He inherits the $X^N$ allele, resulting in the genotype $X^N Y$. The probability of this event, given a male birth, is the probability that the mother's ovum contained the $X^N$ allele, which is $P(X^N Y) = P(\\text{ovum is } X^N) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n2.  He inherits the $X^c$ allele, resulting in the genotype $X^c Y$. The probability of this event, given a male birth, is the probability that the mother's ovum contained the $X^c$ allele, which is $P(X^c Y) = P(\\text{ovum is } X^c) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that the son will have CGD. According to Principle (iii), the disease has full penetrance in hemizygous males. This means a male with the genotype $X^c Y$ will certainly have CGD. Therefore, the event \"the son has CGD\" is equivalent to the event \"the son has the genotype $X^c Y$\".\n\nThe probability that a child, known to be a son, will have CGD is therefore the probability that he inherits the $X^c$ allele from his mother.\n\n$$P(\\text{Son has CGD}) = P(\\text{Son has genotype } X^c Y)$$\nBased on the segregation of the mother's alleles, this probability is:\n$$P(\\text{Son has CGD}) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThis can also be formally expressed using conditional probability. Let $A$ be the event that a child has CGD (genotype $X^c Y$) and $B$ be the event that a child is a son. We want to find $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$.\nAssuming an unaffected father ($X^N Y$), the overall probabilities for any child are:\n- $P(X^N X^N \\text{ daughter}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $P(X^N X^c \\text{ daughter}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $P(X^N Y \\text{ son}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- $P(X^c Y \\text{ son with CGD}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThe event $A \\cap B$ is \"the child is a son and has CGD,\" so $P(A \\cap B) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe event $B$ is \"the child is a son,\" so $P(B) = P(X^N Y) + P(X^c Y) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe conditional probability is:\n$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} = \\frac{1/4}{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The probability that a son of a heterozygous carrier mother will have X-linked CGD is $\\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "5117579"}, {"introduction": "The dihydrorhodamine (DHR) flow cytometry assay is the diagnostic cornerstone for CGD, providing a functional measure of neutrophil oxidative burst.

The description of X-linked CGD, lyonization leading to mosaicism, and the use of DHR flow cytometry to assess neutrophil oxidative burst are all standard concepts in immunology and pediatrics. Modeling histogram peaks with Gaussian distributions is a common and valid analytical technique in flow cytometry data analysis. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary parameters provided. The values are physically plausible. The problem is well-posed, as a unique solution can be derived from the given information. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Action\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle is that in a histogram of events, the total number of events within a subpopulation is proportional to the area under the curve representing that subpopulation's distribution. The function $g(x)$ represents the density of events (cells) at a fluorescence intensity $x$. To find the total number of cells in a subpopulation, we must integrate its distribution function, $g(x)$, over all possible values of $x$, from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$.\n\nLet $N_{D}$ be the number of defective neutrophils and $N_{F}$ be the number of functional neutrophils. These numbers are proportional to the areas under their respective Gaussian curves. Let the constant of proportionality be $k$.\n\nThe number of defective cells, $N_{D}$, is proportional to the integral of $g_{D}(x)$:\n$$N_{D} \\propto \\text{Area}_{D} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g_{D}(x) \\,dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} H_{D}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu_{D})^{2}}{2\\sigma_{D}^{2}}\\right) \\,dx$$\n\nThe number of functional cells, $N_{F}$, is proportional to the integral of $g_{F}(x)$:\n$$N_{F} \\propto \\text{Area}_{F} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g_{F}(x) \\,dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} H_{F}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu_{F})^{2}}{2\\sigma_{F}^{2}}\\right) \\,dx$$\n\nTo evaluate these integrals, we use the standard result for the Gaussian integral:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^{2}) \\,dx = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}}$$\nLet's consider the general form of our integral: $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} H\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) \\,dx$.\nWe perform a substitution $u = \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}$, so $du = \\frac{dx}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}$. The limits of integration remain from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\\text{Area} = H \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u^{2}) (\\sigma\\sqrt{2}) \\,du = H \\sigma \\sqrt{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u^{2}) \\,du$$\nUsing the standard result $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u^{2}) \\,du = \\sqrt{\\pi}$, the area is:\n$$\\text{Area} = H \\sigma \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{\\pi} = H \\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}$$\n\nThis derivation reveals that the total number of cells in a Gaussian-distributed population is proportional to the product of its peak height ($H$) and its standard deviation ($\\sigma$). The mean ($\\mu$) only affects the position of the peak, not its area.\n\nApplying this result to our two subpopulations:\n$$N_{D} \\propto \\text{Area}_{D} = H_{D} \\sigma_{D} \\sqrt{2\\pi}$$\n$$N_{F} \\propto \\text{Area}_{F} = H_{F} \\sigma_{F} \\sqrt{2\\pi}$$\n\nThe proportion of functional neutrophils, $P_{F}$, is the ratio of the number of functional cells to the total number of cells ($N_{D} + N_{F}$).\n$$P_{F} = \\frac{N_{F}}{N_{D} + N_{F}}$$\nSince the cell counts are proportional to the areas, we can write:\n$$P_{F} = \\frac{\\text{Area}_{F}}{\\text{Area}_{D} + \\text{Area}_{F}} = \\frac{H_{F} \\sigma_{F} \\sqrt{2\\pi}}{H_{D} \\sigma_{D} \\sqrt{2\\pi} + H_{F} \\sigma_{F} \\sqrt{2\\pi}}$$\nThe term $\\sqrt{2\\pi}$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator, yielding the derived formula for the proportion:\n$$P_{F} = \\frac{H_{F} \\sigma_{F}}{H_{D} \\sigma_{D} + H_{F} \\sigma_{F}}$$\nThis is the required expression derived from first principles.\n\nNow, we compute the value using the given parameters:\n$H_{D} = 600$\n$\\sigma_{D} = 0.40$\n$H_{F} = 230$\n$\\sigma_{F} = 1.00$\n\nFirst, calculate the products $H_{D}\\sigma_{D}$ and $H_{F}\\sigma_{F}$:\n$$H_{D}\\sigma_{D} = 600 \\times 0.40 = 240$$\n$$H_{F}\\sigma_{F} = 230 \\times 1.00 = 230$$\n\nSubstitute these values into the proportion formula:\n$$P_{F} = \\frac{230}{240 + 230} = \\frac{230}{470}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the decimal value and round to four significant figures:\n$$P_{F} = \\frac{230}{470} \\approx 0.489361702...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.4894$.\nThe proportion of functional neutrophils is approximately $0.4894$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4894}$$", "id": "5117564"}, {"introduction": "Effective management of CGD hinges on preventing the life-threatening infections to which these patients are susceptible.
