The solution will be derived through a series of logical steps based on the provided data.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Required Increase in Respiratory Rate:**\n    The current respiratory rate is $RR_{\\text{current}} = 7\\,\\text{breaths/min}$. The target respiratory rate is $RR_{\\text{target}} = 12\\,\\text{breaths/min}$. The required increase, $\\Delta RR$, is the difference between the target and current rates.\n    $$\n    \\Delta RR = RR_{\\text{target}} - RR_{\\text{current}} = 12\\,\\text{breaths/min} - 7\\,\\text{breaths/min} = 5\\,\\text{breaths/min}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Determine the Required Naloxone Dose per Kilogram:**\n    The problem states a linear pharmacodynamic relationship: a dose increment of $D_{\\text{inc}} = 0.001\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ produces a respiratory rate increase of $\\Delta RR_{\\text{inc}} = 1.5\\,\\text{breaths/min}$. We can use this ratio to find the total dose in $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$, denoted as $D_{\\text{total}}$, needed to achieve the total required increase of $\\Delta RR = 5\\,\\text{breaths/min}$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{D_{\\text{total}}}{D_{\\text{inc}}} = \\frac{\\Delta RR}{\\Delta RR_{\\text{inc}}}\n    $$\n    Solving for $D_{\\text{total}}$:\n    $$\n    D_{\\text{total}} = D_{\\text{inc}} \\times \\frac{\\Delta RR}{\\Delta RR_{\\text{inc}}} = 0.001\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg} \\times \\frac{5\\,\\text{breaths/min}}{1.5\\,\\text{breaths/min}}\n    $$\n    $$\n    D_{\\text{total}} = 0.001\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg} \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{0.01}{3}\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg} \\approx 0.00333...\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}\n    $$\n    This dose is the minimum required to achieve the target, thus satisfying the condition to minimize antagonism of analgesia. We must verify this dose is within the acceptable range of $0.001$ to $0.01\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$. Indeed, $0.001 \\leq 0.00333... \\leq 0.01$, so the calculated dose is valid.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Mass of Naloxone:**\n    The child's weight is $W = 18\\,\\mathrm{kg}$. The total mass of naloxone, $M_{\\text{total}}$, is the product of the dose per kilogram and the child's weight.\n    $$\n    M_{\\text{total}} = D_{\\text{total}} \\times W = \\left(\\frac{0.01}{3}\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}\\right) \\times 18\\,\\mathrm{kg}\n    $$\n    $$\n    M_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{0.01 \\times 18}{3}\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 0.01 \\times 6\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 0.06\\,\\mathrm{mg}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Required Volume of Naloxone Solution:**\n    The available naloxone concentration is $C = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$.

Both are eliminated via the kidneys.\n        - Hydromorphone is metabolized to Hydromorphone-$3$-glucuronide (H3G), which is also renally eliminated.\n        - Fentanyl is hepatically metabolized, producing no clinically significant active metabolites, and undergoes minimal renal elimination.\n    4. Equianalgesic Conversion: Intravenous fentanyl is stated to be approximately $100$ times as potent as intravenous morphine on a milligram-to-milligram basis.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is scientifically and medically sound. It presents a classic clinical scenario of opioid-induced neurotoxicity (OIN) in a patient with severe renal impairment. The patient's GFR of $8\\,\\text{mL/min}/1.73\\,\\text{m}^2$ corresponds to stage $5$ chronic kidney disease (kidney failure). The link between renal failure, morphine administration, and the accumulation of neurotoxic (M3G) and potent analgesic (M6G) metabolites is a fundamental concept in clinical pharmacology. The patient's symptoms of myoclonus and somnolence are hallmark signs of OIN.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient quantitative (weight, dose, GFR) and qualitative (symptoms, diagnoses, pharmacokinetic facts) information to allow for a single best solution to be reasoned from first principles. The objective is clearly defined.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, clinical language, free from subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, with no identifiable flaws. A solution can be derived from the provided information and principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary issue is opioid-induced neurotoxicity secondary to the accumulation of morphine metabolites in the setting of end-stage renal disease. The patient's GFR of $8\\,\\text{mL/min}/1.73\\,\\text{m}^2$ signifies a profound inability to clear renally-excreted substances.\n\n1.  **Identify the Causative Agent**: According to the provided principles, morphine is metabolized to M3G and M6G, both of which are eliminated by the kidneys. In renal failure, these metabolites accumulate. M3G is known to be neuroexcitatory and can cause myoclonus, hyperalgesia, and seizures. M6G is a potent analgesic, and its accumulation contributes to excessive sedation (somnolence) and respiratory depression. The patient's current symptoms are a direct consequence of this process. Therefore, continuing morphine is contraindicated.\n\n2.  **Select an Appropriate Alternative**: The principles guide the selection of a safer opioid.\n    - Hydromorphone is also metabolized to a glucuronide metabolite (H3G) that is renally cleared. While H3G is generally considered less neurotoxic than M3G, its accumulation is still a concern in severe renal failure, making hydromorphone a suboptimal choice.\n    - Fentanyl is stated to be hepatically metabolized with \"no clinically significant active metabolites\" and \"minimal renal elimination\". This pharmacokinetic profile makes it the ideal opioid for patients with severe renal impairment, as its clearance is largely independent of kidney function, and it does not produce metabolites that accumulate to toxic levels.\n    - The logical course of action is to discontinue morphine and initiate fentanyl.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Equianalgesic Dose**: The conversion requires calculating an equivalent dose of fentanyl based on the patient's current morphine consumption.\n    - Current total daily dose (TDD) of IV morphine $= 24$ mg.\n    - The problem states IV fentanyl is $100$ times as potent as IV morphine on a mg-to-mg basis. The conversion factor is: $1\\,\\text{mg IV Morphine} \\approx 10\\,\\text{mcg IV Fentanyl}$.\n    - Equianalgesic TDD of IV fentanyl is calculated:\n    $$ \\text{Equianalgesic TDD} = 24 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg Morphine}}{\\text{day}} \\times \\frac{10 \\, \\text{mcg Fentanyl}}{1 \\, \\text{mg Morphine}} = 240 \\, \\frac{\\text{mcg Fentanyl}}{\\text{day}} $$\n    - To administer this as a continuous infusion, the rate is:\n    $$ \\text{Rate} = \\frac{240 \\, \\text{mcg}}{24 \\, \\text{h}} = 10 \\, \\text{mcg/hour} $$\n\n4.  **Apply Clinical Adjustments for Toxicity**: The patient is already experiencing significant neurotoxicity (myoclonus, somnolence). When performing an opioid rotation in the context of toxicity, it is standard and safe clinical practice to reduce the calculated equianalgesic dose by $25\\%$ to $50\\%$. This accounts for incomplete cross-tolerance between opioids and provides a margin of safety, allowing the toxicity to resolve. A $50\\%$ reduction from the calculated equianalgesic rate of $10$ mcg/hour yields a starting rate of $5$ mcg/hour. This is a prudent starting point.\n\n5.  **Plan for Breakthrough Pain**: A continuous infusion must be supplemented with a protocol for breakthrough pain. A typical breakthrough dose is $50\\%-100\\%$ of the hourly basal rate. A dose of $10$ mcg of IV fentanyl as needed is $200\\%$ of the proposed starting basal rate ($5$ mcg/hour) but $100\\%$ of the full equianalgesic hourly rate ($10$ mcg/hour), making it a robust and appropriate dose to manage escalating pain once the new regimen is initiated.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Switch to continuous intravenous hydromorphone at $0.2$ mg/hour with $0.2$ mg intravenous every $30$ minutes as needed; discontinue morphine.**\nThis option is suboptimal. As stated in the provided principles, hydromorphone produces a renally-cleared metabolite (H3G). Although it may be a modest improvement over morphine, it does not fully resolve the underlying problem of metabolite accumulation. Fentanyl is the superior choice based on the given facts.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Switch to continuous intravenous fentanyl at $5$ mcg/hour with $10$ mcg intravenous every $30$ minutes as needed; discontinue morphine.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with the derived solution. It correctly identifies fentanyl as the appropriate agent. It uses a continuous intravenous infusion, which is the correct modality for a patient with severe, unstable pain requiring titration. The starting basal rate of $5$ mcg/hour reflects a necessary and safe $50\\%$ dose reduction from the calculated equianalgesic rate of $10$ mcg/hour to manage existing neurotoxicity. The provision for breakthrough pain with $10$ mcg doses is adequate for pain management. This plan directly and safely addresses all aspects of the clinical problem.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Continue morphine but extend the dosing interval to every $4$ hours without changing the dose; monitor for neurotoxicity.**\nThis option is unsafe and fails to address the fundamental problem. The issue is the accumulation of toxic metabolites due to a lack of renal clearance, a process with a very long effective half-life in this patient. Simply reducing the frequency of the parent drug administration will slow, but not prevent, the ongoing accumulation. Given that the patient is already symptomatic, continuing the causative agent is a breach of sound pharmacological principles.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Start a transdermal fentanyl patch of $25$ mcg/hour immediately and stop all other opioids; reassess in $12$ hours.**\nThis option is clinically inappropriate due to the route of administration. A transdermal patch has a significant time lag, taking $12$ to $24$ hours to achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations. Stopping all other opioids immediately would leave the child in severe, uncontrolled pain for a prolonged period. This method is suitable for stable, chronic pain, not for an acute situation with escalating pain and toxicity that requires rapid control and titration.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5190059"}]}
