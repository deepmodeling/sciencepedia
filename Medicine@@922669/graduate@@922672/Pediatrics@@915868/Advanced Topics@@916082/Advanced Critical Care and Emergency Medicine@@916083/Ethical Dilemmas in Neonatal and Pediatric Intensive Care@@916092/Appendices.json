Based on clinical examination and early laboratory data, the care team estimates a prior probability of in-hospital mortality of $p_0 = 0.30$. A prognostic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) study is performed on day $3$ of life; the MRI is calibrated against the target condition $M$ defined as neonatal death prior to hospital discharge.

Your explanation should remain conceptually grounded without prescribing any specific clinical decision.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and provides sufficient data to compute the requested posterior probability using established principles of statistics and probability theory. The clinical scenario is realistic and the parameters are plausible.\n\nLet $M$ be the event of in-hospital mortality and $\\bar{M}$ be the event of survival. Let `+` denote a positive MRI result and `-` denote a negative MRI result. The problem provides the following information:\n\nThe prior probability of mortality is $P(M) = p_0 = 0.30$.\nThe sensitivity of the MRI is the probability of a positive result given mortality, $P(+ \\mid M) = 0.80$.\nThe specificity of the MRI is the probability of a negative result given survival, $P(- \\mid \\bar{M}) = 0.90$.\n\nFrom the prior probability of mortality, we can determine the prior probability of survival:\n$$P(\\bar{M}) = 1 - P(M) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$$\n\nThe problem requires us to compute the posterior probability of mortality given a positive MRI result, which is denoted as $P(M \\mid +)$. This is a direct application of Bayes' Theorem:\n$$P(M \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid M) P(M)}{P(+)}$$\n\nTo use this formula, we first need to calculate the denominator, $P(+)$, which is the total probability of a positive MRI result. This can be found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(+) = P(+ \\mid M) P(M) + P(+ \\mid \\bar{M}) P(\\bar{M})$$\n\nWe are given $P(+ \\mid M)$, $P(M)$, and $P(\\bar{M})$. We need to find $P(+ \\mid \\bar{M})$, which is the false positive rate. This can be derived from the specificity. Since a test result can only be positive or negative for a given condition, the probability of a positive result given survival is complementary to the probability of a negative result given survival (the specificity).\n$$P(+ \\mid \\bar{M}) = 1 - P(- \\mid \\bar{M}) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\n\nNow we can calculate the total probability of a positive test, $P(+)$:\n$$P(+) = (0.80)(0.30) + (0.10)(0.70)$$\n$$P(+) = 0.24 + 0.07 = 0.31$$\n\nWith all components available, we can compute the posterior probability $P(M \\mid +)$:\n$$P(M \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid M) P(M)}{P(+)} = \\frac{(0.80)(0.30)}{0.31} = \\frac{0.24}{0.31}$$\n\nTo express this as a simplified fraction, we can write:\n$$P(M \\mid +) = \\frac{24/100}{31/100} = \\frac{24}{31}$$\nSince $31$ is a prime number and does not divide $24$, this fraction is in its simplest form.\n\nThe posterior probability of mortality, given the positive MRI, is $\\frac{24}{31}$. This new risk estimate, which has increased from a prior probability of $30\\%$ to a posterior probability of approximately $77.4\\%$, is a critical piece of information for informing goals-of-care discussions. Its role can be understood within ethical frameworks as follows:\n\nThe updated probability serves as a key input for the process of shared decision-making between the clinical team and the infant's family. It quantifies the prognosis with greater precision, thereby reducing, but not eliminating, prognostic uncertainty. Within the best interests standard, the clinical team and the family must weigh the potential benefits of continuing life-sustaining treatment against the potential burdens. The high posterior probability of mortality ($P(M \\mid +) = \\frac{24}{31}$) suggests that the burdens of continued intensive care—which is invasive, potentially painful, and may prolong the dying process—might be substantial relative to the chance of survival (which is now $1 - \\frac{24}{31} = \\frac{7}{31}$, or approximately $22.6\\%$). This calculation does not account for the probability of severe neurodevelopmental morbidity among survivors, which would also be a crucial consideration. The role of the clinical team is to communicate this updated risk clearly, explaining that it is a probability, not a certainty of outcome. This new information allows the family to deliberate on their values, beliefs, and hopes for their child in a more informed context. For some families, any chance of survival may be worth pursuing. For others, a high likelihood of death or severe disability may lead them to conclude that the burdens of treatment are not in their child's best interest. The posterior probability does not dictate a specific clinical decision but provides a more objective foundation for a collaborative and compassionate conversation about the goals of care, which may include continuing aggressive treatment, redirecting care towards comfort (palliation), or other intermediate options.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{24}{31}}$$", "id": "5139210"}, {"introduction": "Once a prognosis is established, clinicians and families often face a choice between different care pathways, each with its own potential benefits and burdens.

Candidate A has the largest incremental benefit ($p_{\\text{benefit, A}} = 0.28$), which is the most heavily weighted component ($w_1 = 0.55$), strongly favoring this candidate.\n- **Nonmaleficence** (avoiding harm) is captured by $H_{\\text{burden}}$. A higher burden detracts from the total score. Candidate A has a moderate burden ($H_{\\text{burden, A}} = 0.461$), higher than Candidate B ($0.25$) but lower than Candidate C ($0.624$).\n- **Justice** (fairness in allocation, here operationalized as urgency) is captured by $U_{\\text{urgency}}$. Candidate A has a high urgency score ($U_{\\text{urgency, A}} \\approx 0.660$), second only to Candidate C.\n\nThe selection of Candidate A is ethically justifiable within this framework because their profile presents the best overall balance of high expected benefit, significant urgency, and a manageable treatment burden, as synthesized into the highest composite score.\n\nThe problem requires reporting the selected candidate's composite score $S$, rounded to four significant figures.
