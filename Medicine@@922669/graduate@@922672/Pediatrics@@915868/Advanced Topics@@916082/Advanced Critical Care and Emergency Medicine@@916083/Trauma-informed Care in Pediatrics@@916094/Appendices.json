Let $p$ denote the prevalence of probable PTSD in the screened population, $Se$ denote the sensitivity (the probability the test is positive given PTSD is present), and $Sp$ denote the specificity (the probability the test is negative given PTSD is absent). Starting from the core definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and Bayes' theorem, derive analytic expressions for the Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) and the Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$) as functions of $p$, $Se$, and $Sp$.

It is a well-posed problem in applied probability and biostatistics, using standard, clearly defined terms (prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV) and providing a complete set of parameters. The scenario is scientifically grounded and the data are plausible for a clinical screening setting. The task is to derive and apply fundamental formulas from first principles, which is an objective and verifiable process.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an adolescent has probable Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and let $D^c$ be the complementary event that the adolescent does not have PTSD. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe given parameters can be expressed as conditional probabilities:\n- Prevalence, $p = P(D) = 0.10$. The probability of not having PTSD is $P(D^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n- Sensitivity, $Se = P(T^+|D) = 0.85$. This is the probability of a positive test given the presence of PTSD.

Conversely, there is a $51.43\\%$ chance they do not. In the cohort of $1000$, the $175$ positive screens consist of $85$ true positives and $90$ false positives.\n- **Resource Implication:** A positive screen is not a diagnosis. All $175$ adolescents with positive results must undergo a full, resource-intensive confirmatory diagnostic assessment. This means the clinic must have the capacity for approximately $175$ diagnostic workups per month for this program. A significant portion of these resources ($90$ out of $175$, or about $51\\%$) will be allocated to individuals who are ultimately found not to have PTSD. This highlights the inefficiency of the screen in isolation but underscores its role in case-finding. Immediate supportive interventions, such as psychoeducation and safety planning, might be offered to all $175$ individuals pending diagnostic confirmation, which also requires clinical resources.\n\nAn $NPV$ of $0.9818$ means that for every adolescent who tests negative, there is a $98.18\\%$ chance they truly do not have PTSD.\n- **Resource Implication:** A negative result is a strong indicator of the absence of PTSD, providing a high degree of confidence and allowing clinical resources to be focused elsewhere. Out of the $825$ negative screens, $810$ are true negatives. However, the $15$ false negatives represent adolescents with probable PTSD who are missed by the screening tool. In a trauma-informed care model, this is a critical failure. It mandates that clinical judgment must be empowered to override a negative screen. If a clinician has other reasons for concern (e.g., from clinical history, observation, or family report), they should still be able to refer the adolescent for a full assessment. The existence of these $15$ missed cases per $1000$ screened adolescents reinforces that no screening tool is perfect and that a safety net based on clinical expertise is essential.\n\nIn summary, the screening tool is effective at ruling out PTSD (high NPV) but less effective at confirming it (modest PPV). The program will require substantial resources for follow-up on positive screens, and a robust clinical protocol is necessary to manage the significant number of false positives and mitigate the risk of harm from the small but important number of false negatives.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.4857 & 0.9818 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5213560"}, {"introduction": "The performance of many screening instruments is not fixed; it can be tuned by adjusting the decision threshold for what constitutes a \"positive\" screen, a process that involves a critical trade-off.

This value is greater than $0.30$, so this threshold is **inadmissible**.\n-   $t = 56$: $FPR(56) \\approx 0.2743$.

The false positive rate $FPR(56) \\approx 0.2743$ is less than the constraint of $0.30$. Among all admissible options, $t=56$ provides the highest sensitivity ($Se$), thus minimizing false negatives. This statement accurately describes the optimal choice based on the problem's criteria.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Choose $t = 60$: it approximately balances $Se$ and $Sp$, corresponding to the ROC “knee,” and is therefore optimal for minimizing false negatives under the constraint.**\nAt $t=60$, our calculations show $Se(60) \\approx 0.8413$ and $Sp(60) \\approx 0.8413$. The metrics are indeed balanced. However, the objective is not to balance sensitivity and specificity, but to maximize sensitivity under the given constraint. Since $t=56$ is also admissible and provides a higher sensitivity ($Se(56) \\approx 0.9192$), $t=60$ is not the optimal choice for minimizing false negatives. The conclusion is flawed.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Choose $t = 65$: it maximizes $Sp$, greatly reducing false positives, and is therefore optimal for minimizing false negatives under the constraint.**\nThis option correctly states that $t=65$ maximizes specificity ($Sp(65) \\approx 0.9332$) among the choices, which corresponds to minimizing the false positive rate. However, it incorrectly concludes that this is \"optimal for minimizing false negatives.\" Minimizing false negatives is equivalent to maximizing sensitivity. At $t=65$, sensitivity is at its lowest point among the admissible options ($Se(65) \\approx 0.6915$). The reasoning is contradictory.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Choose $t = 55$: it maximizes $Se$ and therefore best minimizes false negatives irrespective of false positive rate.**\nThis option correctly notes that $t=55$ provides the highest sensitivity ($Se(55) \\approx 0.9332$) among all four thresholds. However, it advocates for this choice \"irrespective of false positive rate.\" The problem explicitly states a constraint that the false positive rate must be $\\le 0.30$. Our calculation shows $FPR(55) \\approx 0.3085$, which violates this constraint.

These are well-established tools for evaluating screening programs. The scenario is a realistic application in public health and medical ethics.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated. It provides all necessary quantitative data and qualitative ethical principles (translated into quantitative constraints) to construct a decision criterion. The goal is to identify which of the provided options correctly formalizes these elements into a coherent rule.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is expressed in precise, objective language. The ethical principles are not left to interpretation but are given concrete form through the linkage rate $\\lambda$ and the utility values $b_t$, $h_u$, and $h_f$.\n\nThe problem is free of the specified flaws:\n1.  It does not violate scientific principles.\n2.  It is a formalizable problem directly relevant to the topic.\n3.  The setup is complete and internally consistent.\n4.  The provided data values are plausible for a real-world clinical scenario.\n5.  It is well-structured and admits a unique, logical solution.\n6.  The problem is not trivial; it requires careful integration of multiple quantitative and ethical factors.\n7.  The logic is verifiable through mathematical derivation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Criterion\n\nA principled and ethically sound criterion must incorporate all the constraints and factors provided in the problem statement. The decision to implement screening should be subject to two main conditions:\n1.  Adherence to the clinic's explicit ethical policy regarding disclosure and support.\n2.  A positive net expected utility (i.e., benefits outweigh harms).\n\n**1. The Safety-Capacity Constraint**\n\nThe clinic's policy requires that \"at least $\\lambda = 0.75$ of children with positive screens must be linked to appropriate services.\" This is a primary, non-negotiable constraint.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of expected positive screens per month, $N_{T^+}$.\n-   The number of true positives (TP) is $N_{TP} = N \\cdot p \\cdot Se$.\n-   The number of false positives (FP) is $N_{FP} = N \\cdot (1-p) \\cdot (1-Sp)$.\n-   Total positives: $N_{T^+} = N_{TP} + N_{FP} = N \\left( p \\cdot Se + (1-p) \\cdot (1-Sp) \\right)$.\n\nThe clinic has a capacity of $K$ linkage slots. The number of positive-screened children who can actually be linked is $\\min(K, N_{T^+})$.\nThe fraction of positives who are linked, which we denote as $\\phi$, is therefore:\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{\\min(K, N_{T^+})}{N_{T^+}} = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{K}{N_{T^+}}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{T^+}$:\n$$ \\phi = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{K}{N \\left( Se \\cdot p + (1-Sp) \\cdot (1-p) \\right)}\\right) $$\nThe ethical policy constraint is that this fraction must be at least $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\phi \\ge \\lambda $$\nThis is the first component of a valid decision criterion.\n\n**2. The Net Expected Utility Constraint**\n\nBeyond meeting the policy constraint, the program should result in a net benefit. We construct a total utility function $U$ based on the given benefits and harms for the entire cohort of $N$ individuals.\n-   **Benefit from True Positives:** The benefit $b_t$ applies only to true positives who are timely linked. The total number of TPs is $N_{TP} = N \\cdot Se \\cdot p$. A reasonable model, as is standard in decision analysis, is to assume that the most valuable outcomes (linking a true positive) are prioritized. Thus, linked TPs are the minimum of the available slots, $K$, and the number of TPs, $N_{TP}$. Total benefit = $b_t \\cdot \\min(K, N \\cdot Se \\cdot p)$.\n-   **Harm from Unlinked True Positives:** The harm $h_u$ applies to TPs who are not linked. This occurs when the number of TPs exceeds the capacity $K$. The number of unlinked TPs is $\\max(0, N_{TP} - K)$. Total harm from unlinked TPs = $h_u \\cdot \\max(0, N \\cdot Se \\cdot p - K)$.\n-   **Harm from False Positives:** The harm $h_f$ applies to each false positive. The total number of FPs is $N_{FP} = N \\cdot (1-p) \\cdot (1-Sp)$. Total harm from FPs = $h_f \\cdot N \\cdot (1-p) \\cdot (1-Sp)$.\n\nThe net utility $U$ is the sum of benefits minus the sum of harms:\n$$ U = b_t \\cdot \\min(K, N \\cdot Se \\cdot p) - h_f \\cdot N \\cdot (1-p) \\cdot (1-Sp) - h_u \\cdot \\max(0, N \\cdot Se \\cdot p - K) $$\nFor the program to be ethically justifiable on a utilitarian basis, the net utility should be non-negative:\n$$ U \\ge 0 $$\nThis is the second component of a valid decision criterion.\n\n**Combined Criterion:**\nThe most appropriate criterion is to implement screening if and only if both the safety-capacity constraint and the net utility constraint are met.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\nLet's calculate the numerical values based on the givens:\n-   $N=1000$, $p=0.15$, $Se=0.80$, $Sp=0.90$, $K=120$, $\\lambda=0.75$.\n-   $N_{TP} = 1000 \\cdot 0.15 \\cdot 0.80 = 120$.\n-   $N_{FP} = 1000 \\cdot (1-0.15) \\cdot (1-0.90) = 1000 \\cdot 0.85 \\cdot 0.10 = 85$.\n-   Total positives $N_{T^+} = 120 + 85 = 205$.\n-   Positive Predictive Value $PPV = \\frac{N_{TP}}{N_{T^+}} = \\frac{120}{205} \\approx 0.585$.\n-   Fraction of positives linked $\\phi = \\frac{K}{N_{T^+}} = \\frac{120}{205} \\approx 0.585$.\n\n**A. Implement if $PPV \\ge 0.50$, because at least half of positives would be true positives, which meets a reasonable threshold and makes downstream harms acceptable irrespective of capacity.**\n-   Analysis: This criterion suggests implementation since $PPV \\approx 0.585 \\ge 0.50$. However, it explicitly states to ignore capacity (\"irrespective of capacity\"). This directly contradicts the problem's ethical requirement that disclosure must be accompanied by timely support, which is formalized by the constraint $\\phi \\ge \\lambda$. In this case, $\\phi \\approx 0.585$, which is less than $\\lambda = 0.75$. Therefore, this criterion is ethically incomplete as it violates a stated policy.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Implement only if both the safety-capacity constraint and net expected utility are satisfied, namely: the timely linkage fraction for positives $\\phi = \\min\\!\\left(1, \\dfrac{K}{N\\left(Se \\cdot p + (1-Sp)\\cdot(1-p)\\right)}\\right) \\ge \\lambda$, and the net utility $U = b_t \\cdot \\min\\!\\left(K, N \\cdot Se \\cdot p\\right) - h_f \\cdot N \\cdot (1-Sp)\\cdot(1-p) - h_u \\cdot \\max\\!\\left(0, N \\cdot Se \\cdot p - K\\right) \\ge 0$.**\n-   Analysis: This option presents a two-part criterion that perfectly matches the one derived from first principles. It correctly formalizes both the safety-capacity constraint and the net utility constraint, integrating all relevant variables ($Se, Sp, p, K, N, \\lambda, b_t, h_u, h_f$).\n    -   Constraint 1 (Safety): $\\phi = \\frac{120}{205} \\approx 0.585$. The condition $\\phi \\ge 0.75$ is not met.\n    -   Constraint 2 (Utility): Using $b_t=5, h_u=2, h_f=1$:\n        $U = 5 \\cdot \\min(120, 120) - 1 \\cdot 85 - 2 \\cdot \\max(0, 120 - 120) = 5 \\cdot 120 - 85 - 0 = 600 - 85 = 515$.\n        The condition $U \\ge 0$ is met.\n    -   Since the overall criterion requires both to be true, and the first is false, the rule correctly advises against implementation. This is the most complete and ethically sound criterion.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Implement if $Se \\cdot p \\ge (1-Sp)\\cdot(1-p)$, because this implies $PPV \\ge 0.50$, and capacity can be ignored when PPV is favorable.**\n-   Analysis: The condition $Se \\cdot p \\ge (1-Sp)\\cdot(1-p)$ is equivalent to $N_{TP} \\ge N_{FP}$, which in turn implies $PPV \\ge 0.50$. For the given values, $0.80 \\cdot 0.15 = 0.12$ and $(1-0.90) \\cdot (1-0.15) = 0.10 \\cdot 0.85 = 0.085$. Since $0.12 \\ge 0.085$, the condition holds. However, like option A, this criterion makes the critical error of ignoring capacity, which violates the clinic's explicit ethical policy.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Implement if $K \\ge N \\cdot Se \\cdot p$, because ensuring capacity for all expected true positives is sufficient; harms from false positives are negligible compared with benefits to true positives.**\n-   Analysis: The condition is $K \\ge N_{TP}$. For the given values, $120 \\ge 120$, which is true. This rule would suggest implementation. However, this rule is flawed for two reasons. First, it completely ignores the safety constraint $\\phi \\ge \\lambda$, which depends on the total number of positives ($N_{T^+} = 205$), not just true positives. Second, it wrongly dismisses the harm from false positives as \"negligible\" when the problem assigns a specific harm value to them. It is an incomplete application of the ethical principles.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Implement if $b_t \\cdot PPV \\cdot K \\ge h_f \\cdot (1-PPV)\\cdot K$, because net benefit among those who can be served will be positive regardless of the total number of positives.**\n-   Analysis: This criterion is flawed because it only considers the utility for the $K$ individuals who are linked, and it incorrectly models the harms. It ignores the harm $h_u$ to true positives who are identified but not linked. It also ignores the harm to false positives who are not linked (the problem states harm is for every FP, not just linked ones). Most importantly, it completely ignores the explicit safety-capacity policy constraint $\\phi \\ge \\lambda$. The logic is incomplete and does not account for all harms or constraints.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5213537"}]}
