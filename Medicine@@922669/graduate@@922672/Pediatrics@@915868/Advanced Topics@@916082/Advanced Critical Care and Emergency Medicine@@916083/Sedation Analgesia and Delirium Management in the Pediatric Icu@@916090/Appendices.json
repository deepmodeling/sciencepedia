All parameters are explicitly defined.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A step-by-step derivation of the solution can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is determined in two parts as requested: the calculation of the initial methadone dose and the symbolic description of the taper schedule.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Initial Enteral Methadone Dose**\n\nThe calculation proceeds through a series of conversions based on the provided equianalgesic ratios.\n\n**Step A: Calculate the total daily dose of intravenous fentanyl.**\nLet $R_{fentanyl}$ be the fentanyl infusion rate ($8~\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\cdot\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$), $W$ be the child's weight ($18.5~\\mathrm{kg}$), and $T$ be the number of hours in a day ($24~\\mathrm{h}$). The total daily dose of fentanyl, $D_{Fentanyl, TDD}$, is:\n$$D_{Fentanyl, TDD} = R_{fentanyl} \\times W \\times T$$\n$$D_{Fentanyl, TDD} = (8~\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\cdot\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1}) \\times (18.5~\\mathrm{kg}) \\times (24~\\mathrm{h}) = 3552~\\mu\\mathrm{g}$$\n\n**Step B: Convert the total daily fentanyl dose to the intravenous morphine equivalent (IVME).**\nThe equianalgesic ratio is $100~\\mu\\mathrm{g}$ of IV fentanyl to $10~\\mathrm{mg}$ of IV morphine. The conversion factor, $C_{F \\to M_{IV}}$, is therefore:\n$$C_{F \\to M_{IV}} = \\frac{10~\\mathrm{mg} \\text{ IV Morphine}}{100~\\mu\\mathrm{g} \\text{ IV Fentanyl}}$$\nThe total daily dose in IV morphine equivalents, $D_{M_{IV}, TDE}$, is:\n$$D_{M_{IV}, TDE} = D_{Fentanyl, TDD} \\times C_{F \\to M_{IV}} = 3552~\\mu\\mathrm{g} \\times \\frac{10~\\mathrm{mg}}{100~\\mu\\mathrm{g}} = 355.2~\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\n**Step C: Convert the total daily IVME to the oral morphine equivalent (OME).**\nThe oral morphine dose is specified as $3$ times the intravenous morphine dose. The conversion factor, $C_{M_{IV} \\to M_{Oral}}$, is $3$. The total daily dose in OME, $D_{M_{Oral}, TDE}$, is:\n$$D_{M_{Oral}, TDE} = D_{M_{IV}, TDE} \\times C_{M_{IV} \\to M_{Oral}} = 355.2~\\mathrm{mg} \\times 3 = 1065.6~\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\n**Step D: Validate the condition for the methadone conversion ratio.**\nThe problem states that a specific methadone conversion ratio applies when the total daily OME exceeds $500~\\mathrm{mg}$. Our calculated value is $D_{M_{Oral}, TDE} = 1065.6~\\mathrm{mg}$, which satisfies this condition ($1065.6 > 500$). Thus, we can proceed.\n\n**Step E: Convert the total daily OME to the equianalgesic oral methadone dose.**\nThe ratio given is $1~\\mathrm{mg}$ of oral methadone to $20~\\mathrm{mg}$ of oral morphine. The conversion factor, $C_{M_{Oral} \\to Meth}$, is:\n$$C_{M_{Oral} \\to Meth} = \\frac{1~\\mathrm{mg} \\text{ Oral Methadone}}{20~\\mathrm{mg} \\text{ Oral Morphine}}$$\nThe equianalgesic total daily dose of oral methadone, $D_{Meth, TDE, equi}$, is:\n$$D_{Meth, TDE, equi} = D_{M_{Oral}, TDE} \\times C_{M_{Oral} \\to Meth} = 1065.6~\\mathrm{mg} \\times \\frac{1}{20} = 53.28~\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\n**Step F: Apply the dose reduction for incomplete cross-tolerance.**\nThe dose is reduced by 30% for safety, meaning 70% of the calculated dose is administered. Let the safety factor be $f_{safety} = 0.7$. The initial total daily dose of methadone, $D_{Meth, TDD, initial}$, is:\n$$D_{Meth, TDD, initial} = D_{Meth, TDE, equi} \\times f_{safety} = 53.28~\\mathrm{mg} \\times 0.7 = 37.296~\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\n**Step G: Calculate the dose per administration.**\nThe total daily dose is to be divided into equal doses administered every $6~\\mathrm{h}$. The number of doses per day, $N$, is $\\frac{24~\\mathrm{h}}{6~\\mathrm{h}} = 4$. The single dose of methadone, $d_{Meth, single}$, is:\n$$d_{Meth, single} = \\frac{D_{Meth, TDD, initial}}{N} = \\frac{37.296~\\mathrm{mg}}{4} = 9.324~\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\n**Step H: Round the final answer.**\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$d_{Meth, single} \\approx 9.32~\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\n**Part 2: Symbolic Outline of the Taper Schedule**\n\nThe taper logic is based on a daily reduction of the total daily dose.\n\n**Step A: Define the initial condition and the reduction rule.**\nLet $D_n$ be the total daily dose of methadone on day $n$ of the taper, where $n \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 7\\}$. The initial total daily dose on Day $1$ is $D_1 = D_{Meth, TDD, initial}$.\nThe rule for tapering is that each subsequent day's dose is reduced by 10% of the preceding day's dose.\n$$D_{n} = D_{n-1} - (0.1 \\times D_{n-1}) = (1 - 0.1) \\times D_{n-1} = 0.9 \\times D_{n-1} \\quad \\text{for } n>1$$\n\n**Step B: Formulate the general expression for the daily dose.**\nThis describes a geometric progression. The total daily dose on day $n$ can be expressed in terms of the initial dose $D_1$:\n$$D_n = D_1 \\times (0.9)^{n-1}$$\n\n**Step C: Formulate the expression for the dose per administration.**\nThe dosing interval remains fixed at every $6~\\mathrm{h}$, meaning there are $N=4$ doses per day. Let $d_n$ be the dose per administration on day $n$.\n$$d_n = \\frac{D_n}{4} = \\frac{D_1 \\times (0.9)^{n-1}}{4}$$\n\nThis symbolic framework defines the schedule. For any given day $n$ from $1$ to $7$, the specific dose to be administered every $6$ hours can be calculated using the initial total daily dose, $D_1 = 37.296~\\mathrm{mg}$, and the formula for $d_n$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{9.32}\n$$", "id": "5202106"}]}
