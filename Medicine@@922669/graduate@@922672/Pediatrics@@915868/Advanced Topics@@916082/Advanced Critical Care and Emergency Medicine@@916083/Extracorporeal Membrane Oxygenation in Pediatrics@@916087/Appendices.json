The parameters $\\mathrm{FiO_2}$, $\\mathrm{MAP}$, and $\\mathrm{PaO_2}$ are standard measures in respiratory support. The Oxygenation Index ($OI$) is a widely used and well-defined clinical score. The criterion for considering Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), $OI \\geq 40$, is a standard, evidence-based guideline in pediatrics. The given physiological values are realistic for a patient with the described condition. The problem is scientifically and factually sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary numerical values ($\\mathrm{FiO_2}$, $\\mathrm{MAP}$, $\\mathrm{PaO_2}$) and a clear, unambiguous rule for calculation and decision-making. The reference to the \"standard definition\" of $OI$ is sufficient, as this formula is universally recognized in the field: $OI = (\\mathrm{MAP} \\times \\mathrm{FiO_2} \\times 100) / \\mathrm{PaO_2}$. Although the formula mixes units of pressure ($\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ and $\\mathrm{mmHg}$), this is the established convention for calculating this specific index, and the result is treated as a dimensionless score. The problem asks for dimensionless quantities, which is consistent with the clinical use of $OI$. A unique, stable solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe primary task is to compute the Oxygenation Index ($OI$) and then apply a decision criterion.\n\nThe standard formula for the Oxygenation Index is:\n$$OI = \\frac{\\mathrm{MAP} \\times \\mathrm{FiO_2} \\times 100}{\\mathrm{PaO_2}}$$\nThis formula relates the level of ventilatory support (represented by $\\mathrm{MAP}$) and inspired oxygen concentration (represented by $\\mathrm{FiO_2}$) to the resulting arterial oxygenation (represented by $\\mathrm{PaO_2}$). The factor of $100$ is conventionally included to allow $\\mathrm{FiO_2}$ to be used as a percentage (e.g., $90\\%$), although here it is given as a fraction.\n\nThe given values are:\n- $\\mathrm{MAP} = 20\\,\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$\n- $\\mathrm{FiO_2} = 0.9$\n- $\\mathrm{PaO_2} = 50\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $OI$:\n$$OI = \\frac{20 \\times 0.9 \\times 100}{50}$$\nFirst, we compute the numerator:\n$$20 \\times 0.9 \\times 100 = 20 \\times 90 = 1800$$\nNext, we perform the division:\n$$OI = \\frac{1800}{50} = \\frac{180}{5} = 36$$\nThe problem requires that the $OI$ be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is an exact integer, $36$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $36.0$.\nSo, $OI = 36.0$.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to determine the candidacy for ECMO. The criterion is stated as $OI \\geq 40$ sustained for $4$ to $6$ hours. The problem states that the underlying physiological parameters have been stable for at least $6$ hours, which means the calculated $OI$ of $36.0$ has been sustained for this duration, satisfying the time component of the criterion.\n\nWe now check if the calculated $OI$ meets the threshold:\nIs $36.0 \\geq 40$?\nThis inequality is false.\n\nThe indicator variable $D$ is defined as $1$ if ECMO is indicated and $0$ otherwise. Since the criterion $OI \\geq 40$ is not met, ECMO is not indicated based on this specific rule.\nTherefore, $D = 0$.\n\nThe final result is to be reported as a two-entry row vector $\\left(OI, D\\right)$.\nSubstituting the calculated and determined values:\n$$\\left(OI, D\\right) = \\left(36.0, 0\\right)$$\nBoth entries are reported as dimensionless numbers, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n36.0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5142103"}, {"introduction": "Once the decision to initiate ECMO has been made, the next crucial step is determining the initial blood flow rate to adequately support the patient.

Additionally, oxygenation on ECMO is predominantly limited by blood flow and membrane transfer characteristics, not sweep flow, once CO2 elimination is adequate and $FiO_2$ is maximal.\n\nStep 4: Consider each potential intervention.\n- Increasing sweep gas flow primarily augments carbon dioxide removal by enhancing the sweep-side clearance of CO2; oxygen transfer is relatively insensitive to sweep once a minimal sweep is present, especially when $FiO_2$ is already $1.0$ and CO2 clearance is adequate. Here, CO2 clearance is stable; thus increasing sweep is not indicated for the oxygenation issue.\n- Increasing $FiO_2$ beyond $1.0$ is impossible; $FiO_2$ is already at its maximum. Therefore, this action cannot address the falling post-oxygenator $S_{aO_2}$.\n- Increasing $Q_b$ can increase systemic oxygen delivery and arterial oxygenation by processing more blood through the oxygenator per unit time; however, it does not correct the observed fall in post-oxygenator $S_{aO_2}$ and $P_{aO_2}$, which directly reflect the oxygenator’s outlet content. In a failing oxygenator, raising $Q_b$ may further increase transmembrane pressure and can worsen hemolysis or precipitate circuit failure. The primary problem is membrane dysfunction.\n- Changing the oxygenator addresses the root cause suggested by data: decreased oxygen transfer capacity at $FiO_2 = 1.0$ with a rising transmembrane pressure gradient. Post-oxygenator blood should be nearly fully saturated at $FiO_2 = 1.0$ if the oxygenator is functioning; the fact that post-oxygenator $S_{aO_2}$ has fallen to $89\\%$ at constant $Q_b$ and sweep indicates the oxygenator is no longer performing adequately.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- A. Increase sweep gas flow. Incorrect. Sweep influences carbon dioxide elimination; oxygen transfer is not the limiting factor here given $FiO_2 = 1.0$, and CO2 is already adequately controlled.\n- B. Increase $FiO_2$ to the oxygenator. Incorrect. $FiO_2$ is already $1.0$; it cannot be increased further. The fall in post-oxygenator $S_{aO_2}$ at maximal $FiO_2$ indicates oxygenator dysfunction.\n- C. Change the oxygenator. Correct. Data show reduced oxygen transfer and rising transmembrane pressure at $FiO_2 = 1.0$, consistent with oxygenator failure requiring exchange.\n- D. Increase extracorporeal blood flow $Q_b$. Incorrect as an immediate corrective action for post-oxygenator desaturation. While increasing $Q_b$ can improve systemic oxygen delivery, it does not resolve the observed decrease in post-oxygenator $S_{aO_2}$/$P_{aO_2}$ and may exacerbate pressure gradients across a compromised oxygenator.
