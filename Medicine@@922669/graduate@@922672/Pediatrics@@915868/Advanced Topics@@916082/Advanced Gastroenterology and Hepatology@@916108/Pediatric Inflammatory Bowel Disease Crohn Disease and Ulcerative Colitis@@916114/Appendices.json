This is especially true during an acute severe flare, where decisions about hospitalization and intensive therapy must be made rapidly. The Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) provides a validated, non-invasive method to score disease severity based on patient-reported symptoms and clinical signs, directly guiding management thresholds [@problem_id:5186196].", "problem": "A child with established ulcerative colitis presents to the emergency department with a suspected severe flare. Over the last $24$ hours, the caregiver reports the following: the child passed $9$ stools, including at least one nocturnal stool; rectal bleeding is present as a small amount in most stools; the consistency of most stools is completely unformed; the child describes abdominal pain as moderate; and the child’s general activity is severely restricted (mostly resting and not attending usual activities). Using the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) framework as a validated clinical severity index built from weighted clinical items, compute the total PUCAI score from the provided qualitative and quantitative inputs.

The parameters provided (pain, bleeding, stool characteristics, activity) are the six components of the PUCAI score. The criteria for defining acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) and for considering rescue therapy based on PUCAI scores are consistent with established clinical practice guidelines (e.g., from the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [ECCO] and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition [ESPGHAN]). The problem is therefore scientifically and factually sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary inputs to calculate the PUCAI score. Each qualitative description (\"moderate\", \"severely restricted\") maps to a specific, unique numerical value within the PUCAI framework. The calculation is a simple summation, leading to a unique solution.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem uses standard clinical terminology that has precise definitions within the context of the PUCAI score, leaving no room for subjective interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) is calculated as the unweighted sum of scores from six clinical domains. The total score can range from $0$ to $85$. We will calculate the score for each domain based on the provided data.\n\n1.  **Abdominal Pain**: The patient describes abdominal pain as \"moderate\". In the PUCAI framework, this corresponds to the \"Moderate-Severe\" category.\n    - Score for Abdominal Pain $= 10$ points.\n\n2.  **Rectal Bleeding**: The report states \"rectal bleeding is present as a small amount in most stools\". This description matches a specific category in the PUCAI.\n    - Score for Rectal Bleeding $= 20$ points.\n\n3.  **Stool Consistency**: The consistency of most stools is described as \"completely unformed\".\n    - Score for Stool Consistency $= 10$ points.\n\n4.  **Number of Stools**: The child passed $9$ stools in the last $24$ hours. This falls into the highest frequency category, which is for more than $8$ stools.\n    - Score for Number of Stools ($>8$) $= 15$ points.\n\n5.  **Nocturnal Stools**: The presence of \"at least one nocturnal stool\" is reported. The PUCAI records this as a binary yes/no variable.\n    - Score for Nocturnal Stools (Yes) $= 10$ points.\n\n6.  **General Activity**: The child's activity is \"severely restricted\". This is a direct descriptor for a scoring category.\n    - Score for General Activity $= 10$ points.\n\nThe total PUCAI score is the sum of the scores from these six components:\n$$\n\\text{PUCAI} = (\\text{Pain}) + (\\text{Bleeding}) + (\\text{Consistency}) + (\\text{Frequency}) + (\\text{Nocturnal}) + (\\text{Activity})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{PUCAI} = 10 + 20 + 10 + 15 + 10 + 10 = 75\n$$\nThe computed PUCAI score is $75$.\n\nNext, we address the clinical management questions based on this score.\n\n**Determination of Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis (ASUC)**\nA PUCAI score of $\\ge 65$ is the established definition for acute severe ulcerative colitis in children, warranting hospital admission for intravenous corticosteroid therapy. The calculated score is $75$. Since $75 \\ge 65$, the patient's presentation unequivocally meets the criteria for ASUC, and hospital admission is indicated.\n\n**Consideration for Rescue Therapy**\nThe standard of care for ASUC involves a re-evaluation of disease activity after $3$ to $5$ days of intravenous corticosteroid treatment. A common and validated threshold for predicting corticosteroid treatment failure is a PUCAI score $\\ge 45$ on day $3$ of therapy. The problem posits that the PUCAI remains unchanged at $75$ on hospital day $3$. As $75$ is significantly greater than the threshold of $45$, this represents a clear non-response to corticosteroids. Therefore, initiation of rescue therapy (e.g., with a calcineurin inhibitor like ciclosporin or a biologic agent like infliximab) should be strongly considered at this time to prevent progression to colectomy.\n\nThe final answer requested is the computed PUCAI score.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{75}$$", "id": "5186196"}, {"introduction": "Once disease severity is established, the focus shifts to initiating effective therapy, often with biologic agents like infliximab.
