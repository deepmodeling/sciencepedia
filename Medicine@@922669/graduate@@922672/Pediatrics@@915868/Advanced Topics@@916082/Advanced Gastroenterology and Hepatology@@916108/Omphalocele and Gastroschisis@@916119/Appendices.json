You are asked to estimate the initial continuous crystalloid infusion rate to maintain intravascular volume while compensating for increased insensible losses from the exposed viscera.\n\nUse the following well-tested foundational facts:\n- For infants with body mass $\\leq 10\\ \\mathrm{kg}$, baseline maintenance water requirement follows the Holliday–Segar method of $100\\ \\mathrm{mL/kg/day}$.\n- In gastroschisis, exposed bowel surface area increases evaporative and third-space losses, for which an initial pragmatic adjustment is to increase the maintenance rate within a range of $20$–$40\\%$ above baseline.\n\nAssume the initial estimate uses the midpoint of that adjustment range.

According to the Holliday–Segar method for an infant with mass $\\leq 10\\ \\mathrm{kg}$, this rate is $R_{base} = 100\\ \\mathrm{mL/kg/day}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the total baseline daily fluid volume, which we denote as $V_{base}$.

The adjusted rate is therefore $100\\% + 30\\% = 130\\%$ of the baseline rate. We can define a multiplicative adjustment factor, $k_{adj}$:\n$$k_{adj} = 1 + P_{adj} = 1 + 0.30 = 1.30$$\n\nNow, we calculate the adjusted total daily fluid volume, $V_{adj}$, by applying this factor to the baseline volume:\n$$V_{adj} = V_{base} \\times k_{adj}$$\n$$V_{adj} = 300\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{day}} \\times 1.30 = 390\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{day}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be an infusion rate in units of $\\mathrm{mL/h}$.

The problem asks for the numerical result to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value, $16.25$, already consists of four significant figures ($1$, $6$, $2$, and $5$).
