However, the physical area of an HPF can differ between microscopes, potentially leading to inconsistent diagnoses. This practice provides a hands-on method to standardize eosinophil counts to a reference HPF area, ensuring that the diagnostic criterion is applied uniformly and accurately, regardless of the equipment used [@problem_id:5138042].", "problem": "A school-aged child presents with dysphagia and food impaction, and endoscopic biopsies are obtained from the distal, mid, and proximal esophagus. Histologic review reports eosinophils per high-power field (HPF) of $12$, $18$, and $22$ for the distal, mid, and proximal specimens, respectively, measured on the laboratory’s microscope. Assume the instrument’s HPF area is $A_{\\mathrm{inst}} = 0.25\\ \\mathrm{mm}^{2}$, while the widely used diagnostic criterion for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is defined as a peak count of at least $15$ eosinophils per HPF using a standard HPF area $A_{\\mathrm{std}} = 0.30\\ \\mathrm{mm}^{2}$. Using the core definition that areal density is count per unit area and that counts scale linearly with area under uniform distribution within each HPF, derive the standardized peak eosinophils per HPF across the three levels by converting the instrument counts to the standard HPF area.

It presents a quantitative question based on established clinical and pathological principles regarding the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), specifically addressing the practical issue of standardizing cell counts from microscopes with different high-power field (HPF) areas. The assumptions of uniform eosinophil distribution and linear scaling are explicitly stated, rendering the problem formally solvable.\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the invariance of the areal density of eosinophils for a given biopsy specimen. Let $\\rho$ represent this areal density, defined as the number of eosinophils, $N$, per unit area, $A$.\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{N}{A}\n$$\nThis density is an intrinsic property of the tissue sample at the microscopic level, assuming uniformity within the field of view. Therefore, the density calculated using the laboratory instrument's parameters must be equal to the density that corresponds to the standardized diagnostic system. Let $N_{\\mathrm{inst}}$ be the count observed using the instrument's HPF with area $A_{\\mathrm{inst}}$, and let $N_{\\mathrm{std}}$ be the equivalent count for the standard HPF with area $A_{\\mathrm{std}}$. We can set up the following equality:\n$$\n\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{inst}}}{A_{\\mathrm{inst}}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{std}}}{A_{\\mathrm{std}}}\n$$\nThe goal is to find the standardized count, $N_{\\mathrm{std}}$. Rearranging the equation to solve for $N_{\\mathrm{std}}$ yields the conversion formula:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{std}} = N_{\\mathrm{inst}} \\left( \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{std}}}{A_{\\mathrm{inst}}} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\nThe instrument's HPF area, $A_{\\mathrm{inst}} = 0.25\\ \\mathrm{mm}^{2}$.\nThe standard HPF area, $A_{\\mathrm{std}} = 0.30\\ \\mathrm{mm}^{2}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the scaling factor, which is the ratio of the standard area to the instrument's area:\n$$\n\\text{Scaling Factor} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{std}}}{A_{\\mathrm{inst}}} = \\frac{0.30\\ \\mathrm{mm}^{2}}{0.25\\ \\mathrm{mm}^{2}} = 1.2\n$$\nThis factor is a dimensionless quantity. Now, we apply this factor to each of the raw eosinophil counts provided from the three esophageal locations.\n\nThe raw counts are:\n$N_{\\mathrm{inst, distal}} = 12$\n$N_{\\mathrm{inst, mid}} = 18$\n$N_{\\mathrm{inst, prox}} = 22$\n\nThe corresponding standardized counts ($N_{\\mathrm{std}}$) are calculated as follows:\nFor the distal esophagus:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{std, distal}} = 12 \\times 1.2 = 14.4\n$$\nFor the mid esophagus:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{std, mid}} = 18 \\times 1.2 = 21.6\n$$\nFor the proximal esophagus:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{std, prox}} = 22 \\times 1.2 = 26.4\n$$\nThe diagnostic criterion for EoE is based on the peak eosinophil count. Therefore, we must identify the maximum value among the standardized counts.\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{std, peak}} = \\max(N_{\\mathrm{std, distal}}, N_{\\mathrm{std, mid}}, N_{\\mathrm{std, prox}})\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{std, peak}} = \\max(14.4, 21.6, 26.4) = 26.4\n$$\nThe problem requires this value, which corresponds to the variable $x$, to be rounded to four significant figures. The value $26.4$ currently has three significant figures. To express it with four, we write it as $26.40$. Thus, $x = 26.40$.\n\nNext, we must determine if the diagnostic criterion is met. The criterion is a peak count of at least $15$ eosinophils per standard HPF. We compare our calculated standardized peak count to this threshold:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{std, peak}} \\ge 15\n$$\n$$\n26.40 \\ge 15\n$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the histologic criterion for EoE is fulfilled. The problem specifies that this determination should be represented by a binary variable $y$, where $y=1$ if the criterion is met and $y=0$ otherwise. In this case, $y=1$.\n\nThe final answer is to be reported as a two-entry row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\end{pmatrix}$, where $x$ is the standardized peak count and $y$ is the binary indicator.\nThe calculated values are $x = 26.40$ and $y = 1$.\nThe resulting matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 26.40 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 26.40 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5138042"}, {"introduction": "A significant challenge in diagnosing EoE is its patchy distribution throughout the esophagus, meaning some tissue samples may appear normal even when the disease is present.
