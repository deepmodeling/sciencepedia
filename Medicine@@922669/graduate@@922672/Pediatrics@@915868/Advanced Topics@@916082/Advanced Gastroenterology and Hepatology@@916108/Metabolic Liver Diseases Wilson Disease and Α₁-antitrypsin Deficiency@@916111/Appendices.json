The problem states that under conditions of constant synthesis and clearance, the concentration is proportional to the secretion rate. This relationship can be expressed as:\n$$C \\propto S_{\\text{eff}}$$\nThis implies the existence of a constant of proportionality, $k$, such that:\n$$C = k \\cdot S_{\\text{eff}}$$\nThe constant $k$ is related to the protein's clearance rate from the circulation. We assume this clearance rate is the same for individuals with normal and deficient alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) levels, a standard simplification in this context unless stated otherwise.\n\nLet $C_{\\text{normal}}$ and $S_{\\text{normal}}$ be the serum concentration and effective secretion rate in a healthy individual, respectively. Let $C_{\\text{ZZ}}$ and $S_{\\text{ZZ}}$ be the corresponding quantities for a child with the $\\mathrm{Pi}^{\\ast}\\mathrm{ZZ}$ genotype.
