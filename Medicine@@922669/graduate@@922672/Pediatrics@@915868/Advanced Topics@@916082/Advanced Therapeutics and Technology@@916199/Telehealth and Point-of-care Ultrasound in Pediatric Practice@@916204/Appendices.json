The total round-trip distance, $L$, is therefore twice the depth:\n    $$L = 2d$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the total attenuation in decibels (dB).**\n    The attenuation coefficient, $\\alpha$, is given as approximately $0.5 \\text{ dB} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{MHz}^{-1}$. This value represents the loss per unit distance and per unit frequency. The total attenuation for a specific frequency $f$ traveling a distance $L$ is given by the product of these three quantities. Let us denote the total round-trip attenuation in decibels as $A_{dB}$.\n    $$A_{dB} = \\alpha \\cdot f \\cdot L$$\n    Substituting $L = 2d$, we get:\n    $$A_{dB} = \\alpha \\cdot f \\cdot (2d)$$\n\n3.  **Relate decibels to amplitude ratio.**\n    The decibel scale is fundamentally a logarithmic measure of a ratio of powers or intensities. The attenuation $A_{dB}$ is defined in terms of the initial intensity $I_0$ and the final (attenuated) intensity $I$ as:\n    $$A_{dB} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I}\\right)$$\n    Wave intensity is proportional to the square of its pressure amplitude, $P$ (i.e., $I \\propto P^2$). Therefore, the ratio of intensities can be expressed as a ratio of squared amplitudes:\n    $$\\frac{I_0}{I} = \\frac{P_0^2}{P^2} = \\left(\\frac{P_0}{P}\\right)^2$$\n    where $P_0$ is the initial amplitude and $P$ is the attenuated amplitude. Substituting this into the decibel equation:\n    $$A_{dB} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\left(\\frac{P_0}{P}\\right)^2\\right)$$\n    Using the logarithmic property $\\log(x^y) = y \\log(x)$, this becomes:\n    $$A_{dB} = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{P_0}{P}\\right)$$\n    The required gain factor $G$ must amplify the received attenuated signal amplitude $P$ back to its original unattenuated level $P_0$. Thus, $G \\cdot P = P_0$, which means the gain factor is precisely the amplitude ratio:\n    $$G = \\frac{P_0}{P}$$\n    Substituting $G$ into our decibel equation yields the relationship between the total attenuation in dB and the required linear gain factor:\n    $$A_{dB} = 20 \\log_{10}(G)$$\n\n4.  **Solve for the gain factor G.**\n    We can now solve for $G$ by rearranging the equation:\n    $$\\frac{A_{dB}}{20} = \\log_{10}(G)$$\n    $$G = 10^{\\left(\\frac{A_{dB}}{20}\\right)}$$\n    Substituting our expression for $A_{dB}$ from step 2:\n    $$G = 10^{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha \\cdot f \\cdot 2d}{20}\\right)} = 10^{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha \\cdot f \\cdot d}{10}\\right)}$$\n\n5.  **Substitute the given numerical values.**\n    The problem provides:\n    - $\\alpha = 0.5 \\text{ dB} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{MHz}^{-1}$\n    - $f = 5 \\text{ MHz}$\n    - $d = 10 \\text{ cm}$\n\n    First, calculate the total attenuation $A_{dB}$:\n    $$A_{dB} = (0.5) \\cdot (5) \\cdot (2 \\cdot 10) \\text{ dB}$$\n    $$A_{dB} = (0.5) \\cdot (5) \\cdot (20) \\text{ dB} = 50 \\text{ dB}$$\n    Now, calculate the linear gain factor $G$:\n    $$G = 10^{\\left(\\frac{50}{20}\\right)} = 10^{2.5}$$\n    To evaluate this numerically:\n    $$G = 10^{2} \\cdot 10^{0.5} = 100 \\sqrt{10}$$\n    $$G \\approx 100 \\cdot 3.162277...$$\n    $$G \\approx 316.2277...$$\n\n6.  **Final Answer Formatting.**\n    The problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n    $$G \\approx 316$$\n    In standard scientific notation, this is $3.16 \\times 10^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.16 \\times 10^2}$$", "id": "5210269"}, {"introduction": "Once a clear image is obtained, the next step is often to perform measurements to answer a specific clinical question.
