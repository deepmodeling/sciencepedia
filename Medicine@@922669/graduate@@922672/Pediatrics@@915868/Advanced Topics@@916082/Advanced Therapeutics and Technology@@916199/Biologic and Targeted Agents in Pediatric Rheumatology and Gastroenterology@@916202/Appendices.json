This exercise focuses on a cornerstone concept: the elimination half-life ($t_{1/2}$), which dictates how long a drug persists in the body and informs the dosing schedule.

For practical purposes, assume the drug follows a one-compartment model with linear first-order elimination after reaching steady systemic exposure. Let $A(t)$ denote the amount of drug in the body at time $t$, and let $C(t)$ denote the plasma concentration, with $C(t) = \\frac{A(t)}{V}$ where $V$ is the volume of distribution. Clearance $CL$ is defined for linear systems as the volume of plasma completely cleared of drug per unit time. The elimination process is well-approximated by first-order kinetics driven by an elimination rate constant $k_{e}$ such that the mass balance is given by $\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -k_{e} A(t)$, and the relationship between $CL$, $V$, and $k_{e}$ follows from standard pharmacokinetic definitions under the one-compartment assumption.
