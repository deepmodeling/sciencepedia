It is a straightforward application of defined terms to a set of given data within a scientifically sound context. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of the eliciting dose (ED) based on the provided oral food challenge protocol and the patient's reaction. The ED is defined as the cumulative amount of protein ingested that triggers an objective clinical reaction.\n\nThe dosing schedule consists of a sequence of discrete doses, $d_i$:\n- $d_1 = 1\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n- $d_2 = 3\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n- $d_3 = 10\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n- $d_4 = 30\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n- $d_5 = 100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n\nThe cumulative dose, $C_n$, after the completion of dose $n$ is the sum of all doses administered up to that point: $C_n = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i$.\n\nLet us calculate the cumulative dose at each step of the challenge that the child completed.\n1.  After the first dose ($d_1$), the cumulative dose is $C_1 = d_1 = 1\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n2.  After the second dose ($d_2$), the cumulative dose is $C_2 = d_1 + d_2 = 1\\,\\mathrm{mg} + 3\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 4\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n3.  After the third dose ($d_3$), the cumulative dose is $C_3 = d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 1\\,\\mathrm{mg} + 3\\,\\mathrm{mg} + 10\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 14\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n4.  After the fourth dose ($d_4$), the cumulative dose is $C_4 = d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 = 1\\,\\mathrm{mg} + 3\\,\\mathrm{mg} + 10\\,\\mathrm{mg} + 30\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 44\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n\nThe problem states that the objective reaction occurred after the child completed ingestion of the $30\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ dose, which is the fourth dose, $d_4$. The challenge was terminated immediately, so the fifth dose, $d_5 = 100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, was not administered.\n\nAccording to the definition, the eliciting dose (ED) is the cumulative amount of protein ingested at the first objective reaction. Since the reaction occurred after the full ingestion of the fourth dose, the ED is equal to the cumulative dose at step $4$, which is $C_4$.\n\nTherefore, the eliciting dose is calculated as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{ED} = C_4 = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} d_i = d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{ED} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mg} + 3\\,\\mathrm{mg} + 10\\,\\mathrm{mg} + 30\\,\\mathrm{mg}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{ED} = 44\\,\\mathrm{mg}\n$$\n\nThe eliciting dose for this child is $44\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{44}$$", "id": "5178788"}, {"introduction": "The safety and success of OIT depend on precise dosing, but clinical prescriptions are based on the mass of allergenic protein, not the total mass of the food product used for therapy.

In OIT, dose is prescribed in milligrams of allergenic protein, not milligrams of food powder, because clinical reactivity is driven by the protein antigen load. The physical amount of flour required depends on the protein mass fraction of the specific lot. Let the protein mass fraction of a flour lot be denoted by $w_{P}$, defined by $w_{P} = m_{\\text{protein}}/m_{\\text{flour}}$, where $m_{\\text{protein}}$ is the mass of protein and $m_{\\text{flour}}$ is the total mass of the flour as prepared for dosing.

This is based on the average nitrogen content of the specific proteins in that food. The standard relationship is therefore a direct proportionality:\n$$w_{P} = k \\cdot w_{N}$$\nThis is not an unsupported assumption but the correct and standard interpretation of the terminology provided in the problem statement.\n\nUsing this relationship, we can first calculate the protein mass fraction, $w_P$, for the given lot of peanut flour.\nSubstituting the provided values for $k$ and $w_N$:\n$$w_{P} = (5.46) \\cdot (0.0950)$$\n$$w_{P} = 0.5187$$\n\nNow that we have determined the protein mass fraction of the flour, we can calculate the total mass of flour required to achieve the target protein dose.
