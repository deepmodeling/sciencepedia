The patient has one copy.\n    $$A_{*4} = 1_{\\text{copy}} \\times 0 = 0$$\n\n2.  **Contribution of the `` `*10` `` allele:**\n    The `` `*10` `` allele is a decreased-function allele, with a per-copy activity value of `$0.25$`. The patient has one copy.\n    $$A_{*10} = 1_{\\text{copy}} \\times 0.25 = 0.25$$\n\n3.  **Contribution of the `` `*1x2` `` allele component:**\n    The `` `*1` `` allele is a normal-function allele, with a per-copy activity value of `$1.0$`. The patient has a duplication, resulting in `$N=2$` copies of this allele.\n    $$A_{*1x2} = N_{\\text{copies}} \\times 1.0 = 2 \\times 1.0 = 2.0$$\n\nThe total `$CYP2D6$` activity score `$S$` is the sum of these individual contributions:\n$$S = A_{*4} + A_{*10} + A_{*1x2} = 0 + 0.25 + 2.0 = 2.25$$\n\nThe computed activity score is `$2.25$`.\n\nNext, we map this score to the corresponding phenotype using the provided CPIC bins:\n- Poor metabolizer: score of `$0$`. (Does not match)\n- Intermediate metabolizer: score from `$0.25$` to `$1.0$`. (Does not match)\n- Normal metabolizer: score from `$1.25$` to `$2.25$`, inclusive. Our score `$S = 2.25$` falls within this range.\n- Ultrarapid metabolizer: score greater than `$2.25$`. (Does not match)\n\nThus, the patient is classified as a normal metabolizer.

This is a standard exponential decay equation. With the initial condition $A_{\\mathrm{gut}}(0) = D$, the solution is:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{gut}}(t) = D \\cdot e^{-k_a t}\n$$\n\nNext, we address equation (2). We can express the plasma concentration $C_{\\mathrm{plasma}}(t)$ in terms of the amount $A_{\\mathrm{plasma}}(t)$ and the apparent volume of distribution $V$: $C_{\\mathrm{plasma}}(t) = A_{\\mathrm{plasma}}(t) / V$.
