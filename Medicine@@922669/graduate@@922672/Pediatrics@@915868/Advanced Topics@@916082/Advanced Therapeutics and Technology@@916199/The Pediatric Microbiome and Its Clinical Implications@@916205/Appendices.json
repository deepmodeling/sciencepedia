A stool sample is profiled by amplicon sequencing of the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene. After stringent quality control and rarefaction for didactic purposes, the sample is summarized at the genus level by observed read counts across four genera: $[10, 20, 30, 40]$ (total reads $N = 100$). Using the core definition that microbial community diversity based on Shannon’s framework is the entropy of the discrete relative abundance distribution computed with the natural logarithm, do the following: (i) construct the relative abundance vector from the counts, and (ii) determine the Shannon diversity of this infant stool sample.

The final answer must be a single real number.", "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of data and definitions required for a unique and meaningful solution. The scenario is a standard exercise in quantitative microbial ecology, directly applicable to the specified field of pediatrics. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of Shannon diversity for a microbial community and its interpretation. The provided data are the observed read counts for four distinct genera from an infant stool sample, given as the vector $C = [10, 20, 30, 40]$.\n\n(i) Construction of the relative abundance vector:\nThe total number of reads, $N$, is the sum of the counts for each genus:\n$$N = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} c_i = 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 = 100$$\nThis is consistent with the value provided in the problem statement. The relative abundance of each genus, $p_i$, is its count, $c_i$, divided by the total number of reads, $N$. The relative abundance vector, $P$, is therefore constructed as follows:\n$$p_i = \\frac{c_i}{N}$$\n$$p_1 = \\frac{10}{100} = 0.1$$\n$$p_2 = \\frac{20}{100} = 0.2$$\n$$p_3 = \\frac{30}{100} = 0.3$$\n$$p_4 = \\frac{40}{100} = 0.4$$\nThus, the relative abundance vector is $P = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]$. A necessary check is that the sum of relative abundances equals $1$: $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} p_i = 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.4 = 1.0$.\n\n(ii) Determination of Shannon diversity:\nShannon diversity, denoted as $H$, is defined as the Shannon entropy of the discrete probability distribution of relative abundances. As specified, we use the natural logarithm ($\\ln$), which means the diversity will be expressed in units of nats. The formula is:\n$$H = - \\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i \\ln(p_i)$$\nwhere $S$ is the species richness, which in this case is the number of observed genera, $S=4$.\n\nSubstituting the calculated relative abundances into the formula:\n$$H = - \\left( 0.1 \\ln(0.1) + 0.2 \\ln(0.2) + 0.3 \\ln(0.3) + 0.4 \\ln(0.4) \\right)$$\nWe calculate each term:\n$0.1 \\ln(0.1) \\approx 0.1 \\times (-2.302585) \\approx -0.230259$\n$0.2 \\ln(0.2) \\approx 0.2 \\times (-1.609438) \\approx -0.321888$\n$0.3 \\ln(0.3) \\approx 0.3 \\times (-1.203973) \\approx -0.361192$\n$0.4 \\ln(0.4) \\approx 0.4 \\times (-0.916291) \\approx -0.366516$\n\nSumming these terms:\n$$H \\approx -(-0.230259 - 0.321888 - 0.361192 - 0.366516)$$\n$$H \\approx -(-1.279855)$$\n$$H \\approx 1.279855$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$H \\approx 1.280 \\text{ nats}$$\n\nInterpretation in context:\nShannon diversity is a composite measure that incorporates both species richness and evenness.\n- **Richness:** This refers to the number of distinct taxa. In this sample, the richness is low, with only $S=4$ genera detected. This low richness is characteristic of the gut microbiome of a young infant, which is still in a developmental phase.\n- **Evenness:** This refers to the equality of the distribution of abundances among the taxa. Maximum possible Shannon diversity for a community with $S$ taxa, $H_{\\text{max}}$, occurs when all taxa are equally abundant ($p_i = 1/S$ for all $i$). For $S=4$, this maximum value is:\n$$H_{\\text{max}} = \\ln(S) = \\ln(4) \\approx 1.386 \\text{ nats}$$\nThe calculated diversity of $H \\approx 1.280$ is quite close to the maximum possible value of $H_{\\text{max}} \\approx 1.386$. This indicates a high degree of evenness. The abundances $[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]$ are not equal, but they are not skewed to the point of being dominated by a single genus.\n\nIn summary, for a four-month-old infant, the gut microbiota is expected to be simple (low richness). The calculated value reflects this with $S=4$. However, the high evenness for that given richness suggests that no single genus overwhelmingly dominates the community, which can be a sign of a relatively stable ecological network at this early stage of succession. The community is simple but balanced.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.280}$$", "id": "5211020"}, {"introduction": "Beyond characterizing single communities, pediatric microbiome research frequently aims to understand the impact of exposures like diet by comparing different groups.

To express this with three significant figures, we write $0.250$.\n\nNext, a succinct clinical interpretation of this value is required.\nA relative risk of $0.250$ indicates that the risk of developing NEC among infants who received the probiotic preparation was $0.250$ times (or $25\\%$) the risk of those who received the placebo over the $28$-day study period. This can also be stated as a relative risk reduction of $1 - RR = 1 - 0.250 = 0.75$, or a $75\\%$ reduction in the risk of NEC associated with the probiotic intervention.\n\nFinally, two key limitations that should temper causal interpretation in pediatric microbiome research are:\n$1$. **Strain Specificity and Generalizability:** The term \"probiotic\" is a broad category. The observed clinical effect is specific to the particular strain(s), dose, and formulation used in this trial. It is a fundamental error to generalize these findings to other probiotic products, which may have different compositions and biological activities. Causal attribution is therefore limited to the specific intervention tested and does not extend to \"probiotics\" as a class.\n$2$. **Complexity of the Microbial Ecosystem and Confounding Factors:** The infant gut microbiome is a complex and dynamic ecosystem influenced by numerous factors beyond the intervention, such as mode of delivery, maternal diet and microbiome, antibiotic use, and infant feeding (breast milk vs. formula). While randomization in an RCT is a powerful tool to balance baseline confounders, the intervention interacts with this pre-existing and evolving ecosystem. The ultimate clinical outcome is a result of this complex interaction, not just the simple presence or absence of the administered probiotic. Attributing causality solely to the intervention without understanding these mediating and moderating microbial interactions is an oversimplification. The \"black box\" between the administration of the probiotic and the clinical endpoint remains a significant challenge to a complete causal understanding.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.250}\n$$", "id": "5211102"}]}
