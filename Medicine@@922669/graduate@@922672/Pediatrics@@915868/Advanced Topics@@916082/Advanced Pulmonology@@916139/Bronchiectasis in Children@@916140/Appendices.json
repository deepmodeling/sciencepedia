The problem specifies that the \"percent predicted\" value, denoted with the subscript $\\text{pp}$, should be expressed as a unitless decimal ratio.\n\nFirst, we calculate the $FEV_1$ percent predicted ratio, $FEV_{1, \\text{pp}}$. The formula is given by the ratio of the measured value to the predicted value.\n$$\nFEV_{1, \\text{pp}} = \\frac{FEV_{1, \\text{meas}}}{FEV_{1, \\text{pred}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nFEV_{1, \\text{pp}} = \\frac{1.42}{1.90} \\approx 0.74736842...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get:\n$$\nFEV_{1, \\text{pp}} = 0.7474\n$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the $FEF_{25-75}$ percent predicted ratio, $FEF_{25-75, \\text{pp}}$. The formula is analogous.\n$$\nFEF_{25-75, \\text{pp}} = \\frac{FEF_{25-75, \\text{meas}}}{FEF_{25-75, \\text{pred}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nFEF_{25-75, \\text{pp}} = \\frac{1.26}{2.75} \\approx 0.45818181...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures:\n$$\nFEF_{25-75, \\text{pp}} = 0.4582\n$$\n\nThird, we compute the quantitative disproportion index $D$, which is defined as the difference between the two previously calculated ratios.\n$$\nD = FEV_{1, \\text{pp}} - FEF_{25-75, \\text{pp}}\n$$\nTo maintain precision, the calculation should be performed using values with higher precision before the final rounding step.\n$$\nD \\approx 0.74736842... - 0.45818181... = 0.28918661...\n$$\nRounding this final result to four significant figures:\n$$\nD = 0.2892\n$$\nIf one were to use the pre-rounded values for the component indices, the result is identical in this case: $D = 0.7474 - 0.4582 = 0.2892$.\n\nFinally, as requested for the working, we can infer the physiological meaning of these results. $FEV_1$ is a measure of airflow that is weighted towards the larger, more central airways. $FEF_{25-75}$ specifically measures the average flow rate during the middle half of a forced expiration and is considered a more sensitive indicator of obstruction in the small to medium-sized peripheral airways. In this case, the $FEV_1$ is reduced to approximately $75\\%$ of predicted, while the $FEF_{25-75}$ is more severely reduced to approximately $46\\%$ of predicted. The fact that $FEF_{25-75, \\text{pp}}$ is substantially lower than $FEV_{1, \\text{pp}}$, resulting in a large positive disproportion index $D = 0.2892$, suggests that the obstructive process affects the smaller airways to a greater extent than the larger airways. This finding is characteristic of disproportionate small airway involvement, a common feature in bronchiectasis.\n\nThe three required numerical results are the $FEV_1$ percent predicted decimal ($0.7474$), the $FEF_{25-75}$ percent predicted decimal ($0.4582$), and the disproportion index $D$ ($0.2892$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.7474 & 0.4582 & 0.2892\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5111433"}, {"introduction": "High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) is the gold standard for diagnosing bronchiectasis and evaluating its structural severity.

On HRCT, this is quantified by the broncho-arterial ($B/A$) ratio, where the bronchial diameter is compared to that of its adjacent pulmonary artery branch. In a healthy state, this ratio is approximately $1$. A $B/A$ ratio greater than $1$ (the \"signet ring sign\") is the cardinal sign of bronchiectasis. The magnitude of this ratio directly reflects the severity of bronchial dilation, which is a proxy for the degree of structural damage to the airway wall, including destruction of elastic and muscular components. This damage impairs mucociliary clearance, creating a nidus for recurrent infection and inflammation.\n\n2.  **Peribronchial wall thickening ($W/A$ ratio)**: Pediatric bronchiectasis is driven by a vicious cycle of infection and inflammation. Persistent microbial presence triggers a chronic inflammatory response within the bronchial walls. This leads to cellular infiltration, edema, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and eventually fibrosis. These changes manifest radiologically as thickening of the bronchial walls. Measuring this thickness, often normalized to the diameter of the adjacent artery ($W/A$ ratio), quantifies the inflammatory burden. Increased wall thickness contributes to airway narrowing and further compromises mucus clearance, perpetuating the disease cycle.\n\n3.  **Mosaic attenuation/air-trapping**: This radiological finding is a key indicator of concomitant small airway disease, which is integral to the pathophysiology of bronchiectasis. The inflammatory and destructive processes extend from the larger bronchi into the smaller, peripheral airways (bronchioles). Obstruction of these bronchioles, due to inflammation, fibrosis, or mucus plugging, leads to air-trapping: air can be inhaled past the obstruction but cannot be fully exhaled. This results in a heterogeneous pattern of lung attenuation on HRCT, especially on expiratory images, known as mosaic attenuation. The extent of this pattern quantifies the severity of small airway dysfunction, which is often a primary driver of airflow limitation and respiratory symptoms in patients.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.6250}\n$$", "id": "5111426"}, {"introduction": "Effective management of acute exacerbations is central to improving outcomes in pediatric bronchiectasis, requiring precise and safe antibiotic dosing.

The suspension contains $42.9 \\text{ mg}$ of clavulanate per $5 \\text{ mL}$. The concentration of clavulanate, $C_{clav}$, is:\n$$C_{clav} = \\frac{42.9 \\text{ mg}}{5 \\text{ mL}} = 8.58 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}$$\n\nThe amount of clavulanate in a single $9 \\text{ mL}$ dose, $D_{clav,single}$, is:\n$$D_{clav,single} = C_{clav} \\times V_{single} = 8.58 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}} \\times 9 \\text{ mL} = 77.22 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nThe total daily dose of clavulanate, $D_{clav,total}$, for a BID regimen is:\n$$D_{clav,total} = D_{clav,single} \\times n = 77.22 \\text{ mg} \\times 2 = 154.44 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}}$$\n\nNow we verify this total daily dose against the two safety limits provided:\n1.  **Maximum dose per body weight**: The limit is no more than $10 \\text{ mg/kg/day}$. We calculate the patient's daily clavulanate intake in mg/kg/day:\n    $$D_{clav,rate} = \\frac{D_{clav,total}}{W} = \\frac{154.44 \\text{ mg/day}}{24 \\text{ kg}} \\approx 6.435 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}}$$\n    Since $6.435 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} \\leq 10 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}}$, this limit is not exceeded.\n\n2.  **Absolute maximum daily dose**: The limit is $250 \\text{ mg/day}$.\n    Since $D_{clav,total} = 154.44 \\text{ mg/day} \\leq 250 \\text{ mg/day}$, this limit is also not exceeded.\n\nBoth clavulanate safety limits are met. The calculated single per-dose volume of $9 \\text{ mL}$ is correct and safe according to the problem's constraints.\n\nThe final answer must be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated volume is exactly $9 \\text{ mL}$. To express this with three significant figures, we write $9.00 \\text{ mL}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9.00}$$", "id": "5111449"}]}
