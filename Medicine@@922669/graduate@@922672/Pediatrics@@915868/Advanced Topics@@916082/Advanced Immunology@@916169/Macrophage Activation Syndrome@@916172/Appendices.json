This is the product of the body mass and the dosing factor.\n$$\nD_{weight} = m \\times D_f\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nD_{weight} = 20 \\text{ kg} \\times 30 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} = 600 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\n\nNext, we must apply the therapeutic cap. The actual daily dose administered, denoted as $D_{daily}$, is the lesser of the calculated weight-based dose and the maximum allowed daily dose.\n$$\nD_{daily} = \\min(D_{weight}, D_{cap})\n$$\nTo compare these two values, they must be in the same units. We convert the cap from grams to milligrams, using the conversion factor $1 \\text{ g} = 1000 \\text{ mg}$.\n$$\nD_{cap} = 1 \\text{ g/day} = 1000 \\text{ mg/day}\n$$\nNow we can determine the correct daily dose:\n$$\nD_{daily} = \\min(600 \\text{ mg/day}, 1000 \\text{ mg/day}) = 600 \\text{ mg/day}\n$$\nThe appropriate daily pulse dose for this child is $600 \\text{ mg}$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total dose administered over the full course, denoted as $D_{total}$. The regimen is administered once daily for $3$ consecutive days.\n$$\nD_{total} = D_{daily} \\times T\n$$\nSubstituting the values for the daily dose and the duration:\n$$\nD_{total} = 600 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}} \\times 3 \\text{ days} = 1800 \\text{ mg}\n$$\nThe total amount of methylprednisolone administered over the $3$-day course is $1800 \\text{ mg}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1800}\n$$", "id": "5168233"}, {"introduction": "Beyond static measurements, the dynamic trajectory of biomarkers is key to assessing disease activity and guiding the urgency of intervention in MAS.

The doubling time is the interval over which the ferritin value doubles.

The principle states that more rapid ferritin kinetics indicate higher urgency. A doubling time of $t_d \\approx 20.67$ hours means that the patient's serum ferritin level, a key marker of disease activity in MAS, is doubling in less than one day.

We can now calculate the posterior odds.\n$$ \\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Prior Odds} \\times \\text{LR}+ = \\frac{3}{7} \\times 8 = \\frac{24}{7} $$\nThe posterior odds represent the odds of having MAS after observing the high ferritin result.

Let $p$ be the probability of the patient having MAS. The optimal decision is the one that minimizes the expected harm.\n\nThe expected harm of withholding treatment, $E(\\text{loss}|\\text{Withhold})$, is calculated by summing the harms of the outcomes, weighted by their respective probabilities:\n$$ E(\\text{loss}|\\text{Withhold}) = p \\times (\\text{Harm if MAS present and untreated}) + (1-p) \\times (\\text{Harm if MAS absent and untreated}) $$\n$$ E(\\text{loss}|\\text{Withhold}) = p \\cdot M + (1-p) \\cdot 0 = pM $$\nThe expected harm of administering treatment, $E(\\text{loss}|\\text{Treat})$, is:\n$$ E(\\text{loss}|\\text{Treat}) = p \\times (\\text{Harm if MAS present and treated}) + (1-p) \\times (\\text{Harm if MAS absent and treated}) $$\n$$ E(\\text{loss}|\\text{Treat}) = p \\cdot R + (1-p) \\cdot H $$\nThe treatment threshold, $p_t$, is the probability of disease at which the expected harms of both actions are equal. At this point, one is indifferent between treating and withholding.\n$$ E(\\text{loss}|\\text{Treat}) = E(\\text{loss}|\\text{Withhold}) $$\n$$ p_t R + (1-p_t)H = p_t M $$\nWe solve for $p_t$:\n$$ p_t R + H - p_t H = p_t M $$\n$$ H = p_t M - p_t R + p_t H $$\n$$ H = p_t (M - R + H) $$\n$$ p_t = \\frac{H}{M - R + H} $$\nThis formula gives the treatment threshold probability. If the patient's probability of disease $p$ is greater than $p_t$, then $p > \\frac{H}{M-R+H}$, which implies $p(M-R+H) > H$, and rearranging leads to $pM > pR + (1-p)H$. This means $E(\\text{loss}|\\text{Withhold}) > E(\\text{loss}|\\text{Treat})$, so treatment is the preferred action to minimize expected harm.\n\nNow, we substitute the given harm values: $M=0.5$, $R=0.1$, and $H=0.02$.\n$$ p_t = \\frac{0.02}{0.5 - 0.1 + 0.02} = \\frac{0.02}{0.42} = \\frac{2}{42} = \\frac{1}{21} $$\nAs a decimal, the threshold is:\n$$ p_t \\approx 0.0476 $$\n\n**Part 3: Comparison and Conclusion**\n\nWe must now determine if the updated probability of MAS exceeds this treatment threshold.\n- The posterior probability of MAS is $P(D|F) = \\frac{24}{31} \\approx 0.7742$.\n- The treatment threshold is $p_t = \\frac{1}{21} \\approx 0.0476$.\n\nComparing the two values:\n$$ 0.7742 > 0.0476 $$\nThe posterior probability of MAS after the positive ferritin test is substantially higher than the calculated treatment threshold.
