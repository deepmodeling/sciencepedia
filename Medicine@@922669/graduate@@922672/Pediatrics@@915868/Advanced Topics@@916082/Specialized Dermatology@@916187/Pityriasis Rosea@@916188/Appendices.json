The primary care clinician suspects pityriasis rosea (PR), a self-limited papulosquamous exanthem likely triggered by Human Herpesvirus type $6$ and type $7$ (HHV-$6/7$), and notes multiple oval, salmon-colored plaques with collarette scale oriented along lines of cleavage.

The description of pityriasis rosea, its typical clinical course, and its association with HHV-$6/7$ are consistent with established medical knowledge. The features described as atypical (palmoplantar involvement, mucosal erosions) are indeed recognized red flags in dermatology that prompt clinicians to consider a broader differential diagnosis. The differential includes secondary syphilis (for which an RPR is appropriate), erythema multiforme, and lichen planus, all of which are valid considerations. The decision-making principle provided is a sound articulation of Bayesian reasoning in clinical practice.\n-   **Well-Posed**: Yes. A clinical scenario is presented with sufficient detail to allow for a reasoned decision. The question asks for the best justification among the options provided, which is a standard format for clinical reasoning problems.\n-   **Objective**: Yes. The problem uses precise, objective clinical terminology and avoids subjective or emotionally laden language.\n\nThe problem is self-contained, internally consistent, and scientifically sound. It presents a realistic diagnostic dilemma that requires the application of fundamental clinical principles. No flaws are identified.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of a solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe diagnosis of pityriasis rosea (PR) is typically made on clinical grounds when the presentation is classic. The classic features, many of which are present in this case, include a herald patch followed by a generalized eruption of smaller, oval, pink-to-red plaques with fine scale (collarette scale) in a \"Christmas tree\" distribution on the trunk (along lines of cleavage).\n\nHowever, a key task in diagnosis is to recognize atypical features that challenge the initial hypothesis and raise the probability of alternative diagnoses. In this case, two significant atypical features are present:\n$1$. **Palmoplantar involvement**: Lesions on the palms and soles are rare in PR but are a hallmark feature of secondary syphilis.\n$2$. **Mucosal involvement**: Oral erosions are also highly uncharacteristic of PR but are seen in conditions such as erythema multiforme, pemphigus, mucous membrane pemphigoid, and oral lichen planus. Secondary syphilis can also present with oral mucous patches.\n\nThe provided decision-making framework mandates that a test (here, a biopsy) is justified if these atypical findings—the \"Data\"—sufficiently increase the posterior probability of an alternative diagnosis, $P(\\text{Alt} \\mid \\text{Data})$. The alternatives, particularly secondary syphilis, are serious conditions with significant morbidity if missed and untreated. The risks of missing secondary syphilis (e.g., progression to tertiary syphilis) are far greater than the risks of a skin biopsy (e.g., pain, bleeding, infection, scarring).\n\nTherefore, the presence of palmoplantar and oral mucosal lesions significantly weakens the diagnosis of PR and strengthens the possibility of mimics. This diagnostic uncertainty warrants further investigation. While the RPR test for syphilis is pending, a skin biopsy can provide valuable, and faster, information. Histopathology can help differentiate between these conditions. For example, a biopsy can show the characteristic plasma cell-rich infiltrate of syphilis, the interface dermatitis of erythema multiforme or lichen planus, or the non-specific superficial perivascular dermatitis of PR. The biopsy's primary role in this context is to rule out the more serious alternatives.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Perform a biopsy to confirm PR in a case with a herald patch and classic truncal distribution along lines of cleavage, because histopathology is routinely required for diagnosis.**\n-   **Analysis**: This statement is factually incorrect. The diagnosis of classic PR is clinical. Histopathology is *not* routinely required. A biopsy is typically reserved for atypical cases or when the diagnosis is in doubt. This option incorrectly states the standard of care.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**B. Perform a biopsy because palmoplantar involvement and mucosal erosions are atypical for PR and increase the posterior probability of alternative diagnoses (e.g., secondary syphilis, erythema multiforme, lichen planus, drug eruption), making tissue examination useful while serologic tests are pending.**\n-   **Analysis**: This statement accurately reflects the clinical reasoning process. It correctly identifies the palmoplantar and mucosal lesions as atypical. It correctly concludes that these findings increase the likelihood of other important diagnoses. It correctly lists relevant alternative diagnoses. Finally, it correctly identifies the utility of a biopsy in clarifying the diagnosis, especially while awaiting other test results. This justification aligns perfectly with the decision-making principle provided in the problem statement.\n-   **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**C. Perform a biopsy because antipruritic therapy did not fully relieve itching, and partial symptomatic response indicates diagnostic uncertainty that requires histopathology.**\n-   **Analysis**: The problem statement makes no mention of pruritus or its treatment. This option introduces facts not in evidence. Furthermore, even if true, the degree of pruritus and its response to therapy are highly variable and non-specific signs. This would be a very weak justification for an invasive procedure compared to the major morphological red flags of palm, sole, and oral mucosal involvement.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. Perform a biopsy because PR is caused by HHV-$6/7$, and routine histopathology reliably demonstrates viral-specific inclusion bodies that definitively establish the diagnosis.**\n-   **Analysis**: This statement contains significant factual errors. While PR is associated with HHV-$6/7$, its histopathology is non-specific (typically a superficial perivascular dermatitis). Crucially, it does *not* show viral-specific inclusion bodies in the way that, for example, a herpes simplex infection does. Therefore, a biopsy cannot \"definitively establish the diagnosis\" of PR on this basis. Its utility is in ruling out other conditions.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. Perform a biopsy primarily to provide reassurance to the family, because parental preference is the principal determinant of test ordering in a child without systemic symptoms.**\n-   **Analysis**: This Cites an unethical and inappropriate justification for medical testing. The principal determinant for ordering a test, especially an invasive one, must be medical necessity based on a sound clinical rationale. While family concerns and shared decision-making are important, they do not supersede the need for a valid medical indication. In this case, a valid medical indication *does* exist (diagnostic uncertainty due to atypical features), but this option misidentifies the primary reason as family preference, which is incorrect.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5195733"}, {"introduction": "Effective diagnosis is not just about recognizing patterns, but also about quantitatively updating your clinical suspicion based on new evidence. Secondary syphilis is a critical mimic of pityriasis rosea, and serological testing is a cornerstone of its evaluation.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical epidemiology and biostatistics, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is stated using objective, formal language. The problem requires a direct application of Bayes' theorem, a fundamental concept in probability theory, to a realistic clinical scenario.\n\nLet $S$ be the event that the patient has active syphilis. Let $S^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have active syphilis.\nLet $T^{-}$ be the event of a negative Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) test result, and $T^{+}$ be the event of a positive test result.\n\nThe problem provides the following information, which we translate into probabilistic terms:\n1.  The pretest probability of active syphilis is given as $P(S) = 0.10$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the RPR test is the probability of a positive test given that the disease is present: $P(T^{+} | S) = 0.86$.\n3.  The specificity of the RPR test is the probability of a negative test given that the disease is absent: $P(T^{-} | S^c) = 0.98$.\n\nFrom the pretest probability $P(S)$, we can determine the probability that the patient does not have active syphilis:\n$$P(S^c) = 1 - P(S) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$$\n\nThe objective is to compute the post-test probability of active syphilis given a negative test result, which is denoted as $P(S | T^{-})$. We will use Bayes' theorem, which is stated as:\n$$P(S | T^{-}) = \\frac{P(T^{-} | S) \\cdot P(S)}{P(T^{-})}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^{-})$, represents the total probability of obtaining a negative test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, which involves summing the probabilities of a negative result over all possible disease states (present or absent):\n$$P(T^{-}) = P(T^{-} | S) \\cdot P(S) + P(T^{-} | S^c) \\cdot P(S^c)$$\n\nTo use this formula, we first need to determine $P(T^{-} | S)$, which is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient has syphilis. This quantity is also known as the false negative rate. It is the complement of the sensitivity, $P(T^{+} | S)$, since for a patient with the disease, the test can only be positive or negative.\n$$P(T^{-} | S) = 1 - P(T^{+} | S) = 1 - 0.86 = 0.14$$\n\nNow we have all the components to calculate the total probability of a negative test, $P(T^{-})$:\nThe first term, $P(T^{-} | S) \\cdot P(S)$, is the probability of a false negative result:\n$$P(T^{-} | S) \\cdot P(S) = 0.14 \\times 0.10 = 0.014$$\nThe second term, $P(T^{-} | S^c) \\cdot P(S^c)$, is the probability of a true negative result:\n$$P(T^{-} | S^c) \\cdot P(S^c) = 0.98 \\times 0.90 = 0.882$$\nThe total probability of a negative test is the sum of these two terms:\n$$P(T^{-}) = 0.014 + 0.882 = 0.896$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerator, $P(T^{-} | S) \\cdot P(S) = 0.014$, and the calculated denominator, $P(T^{-}) = 0.896$, back into Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(S | T^{-}) = \\frac{0.014}{0.896}$$\n\nTo express this result as a reduced fraction, we first clear the decimals by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $1000$:\n$$P(S | T^{-}) = \\frac{14}{896}$$\nWe simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. We start by dividing by $2$:\n$$\\frac{14 \\div 2}{896 \\div 2} = \\frac{7}{448}$$\nNext, we check if $448$ is divisible by $7$. Performing the division, $448 \\div 7 = 64$.
