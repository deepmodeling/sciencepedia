It is therefore deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nLet $A_{total}$ denote the total body surface area of the child. The problem is framed in terms of fractions of this total area.\n\nThe given fractions are:\n- The fraction of BSA corresponding to the trunk, $F_{trunk}$, is $30\\%$, or $0.30$.\n- The fraction of BSA corresponding to one palm, $F_{palm}$, is $1\\%$, or $0.01$.\n\nWe are tasked with calculating the total fraction of BSA involved, $F_{involved}$. This is the sum of the fractional areas of all lesions.\n\n1.  **Calculate the fractional area of the trunk involvement:**\n    The problem states that the plaques cover \"exactly half\" of the trunk surface.

Let the total fractional area of these lesions be $F_{lesion, thighs}$.\n    $$F_{lesion, thighs} = 2 \\times F_{palm}$$\n    Substituting the given value for $F_{palm}$:\n    $$F_{lesion, thighs} = 2 \\times 0.01 = 0.02$$\n    So, the thigh lesions cover $2\\%$ of the total BSA.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total fractional area of involvement:**\n    The problem explicitly states that the lesions are disjoint (\"do not overlap\").

The problem is self-contained and a unique solution can be determined.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid. A reasoned solution can be constructed.\n\n**Step 3: Solution Derivation**\nThe total quantity of ointment required, denoted as $M_{total}$, can be calculated by determining the amount needed per application and multiplying by the total number of applications over the treatment period.\n\nFirst, we determine the total area to be treated in terms of the patient's palmar surfaces. The involved area is given as $10\\%$ of the BSA. The problem states that one palmar surface corresponds to $1\\%$ of the BSA. Let $A_{treat}$ be the area to be treated.\n$$A_{treat} = 10\\% \\text{ BSA}$$\nUsing the provided approximation:\n$$1\\% \\text{ BSA} = 1 \\text{ palmar surface}$$\nTherefore, the area to be treated is equivalent to $10$ palmar surfaces.\n$$A_{treat} = 10 \\times (1 \\text{ palmar surface})$$\n\nNext, we calculate the number of Fingertip Units (FTUs) required for a single application to cover this area. According to the problem, $1$ FTU covers an area of $2$ palmar surfaces. Let $N_{FTU/app}$ be the number of FTUs per application.\n$$N_{FTU/app} = \\frac{\\text{Total area to cover}}{\\text{Area covered per FTU}} = \\frac{10 \\text{ palmar surfaces}}{2 \\text{ palmar surfaces/FTU}} = 5 \\text{ FTU}$$\nSo, $5$ FTUs are needed for each application.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of applications required for the entire treatment duration. The ointment is applied twice daily for $1$ week.\n$$1 \\text{ week} = 7 \\text{ days}$$\nThe total number of applications, $N_{app}$, is:\n$$N_{app} = (\\text{applications per day}) \\times (\\text{number of days}) = 2 \\, \\frac{\\text{applications}}{\\text{day}} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 14 \\text{ applications}$$\n\nWe can now find the total number of FTUs needed for the entire week, $N_{FTU,total}$.\n$$N_{FTU,total} = N_{FTU/app} \\times N_{app} = 5 \\text{ FTU/application} \\times 14 \\text{ applications} = 70 \\text{ FTU}$$\n\nFinally, we convert the total number of FTUs into a mass in grams. The problem provides that $1$ FTU is approximately $0.5$ grams of ointment.\n$$M_{total} = N_{FTU,total} \\times (\\text{mass per FTU}) = 70 \\text{ FTU} \\times 0.5 \\, \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{FTU}}$$\n$$M_{total} = 35 \\text{ g}$$\n\nThus, the total quantity of ointment to dispense for the full week of treatment is $35$ grams.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{35}$$", "id": "5197620"}, {"introduction": "For children with severe or refractory psoriasis, systemic agents are often necessary, requiring a deep understanding of pharmacokinetics and potential toxicities.

The scenario is realistic and clinically relevant.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n#### Part 1: Calculation of Adjusted Cyclosporine Volume\n\nThe fundamental principle is that, under assumptions of linear pharmacokinetics, the total drug exposure, as measured by the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), is directly proportional to the bioavailable dose.\nLet $E_0$ represent the intended target exposure achieved with the original prescribed dose, and let $D_0$ be the total daily dose prescribed.\n\n$1.$ Calculate the original total daily dose, $D_0$:\nThe prescribed rate is $R = 4\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,kg^{-1}\\,day^{-1}}$ for a child with mass $m = 25\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n$$D_0 = R \\times m = (4\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,kg^{-1}\\,day^{-1}}) \\times (25\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 100\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,day^{-1}}$$\n\n$2.$ Calculate the original amount per dose, $d_0$:\nThe total daily dose is divided into two equal doses.\n$$d_0 = \\frac{D_0}{2} = \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{2} = 50\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\n$3.$ Model the effect of the drug interaction:\nThe co-administered azole antifungal, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, reduces the metabolic clearance of cyclosporine. This increases the exposure for a given dose by a factor of $k = 1.5$. If the original dose $D_0$ were administered during azole co-therapy, the new exposure $E_{new}$ would be:\n$$E_{new} = k \\cdot E_0$$\nThe clinical objective is to adjust the dose to maintain the original intended exposure, $E_0$.\n\n$4.$ Derive the adjusted daily dose, $D_{adj}$:\nLet $D_{adj}$ be the adjusted total daily dose that, in the presence of the inhibitor, yields the target exposure $E_0$. The exposure from $D_{adj}$ is magnified by the factor $k$. We set this equal to the target exposure, which is proportional to the original dose $D_0$.\n$$k \\cdot (\\text{exposure from } D_{adj}) = (\\text{exposure from } D_0)$$\nAssuming a direct proportionality between dose and exposure, this simplifies to:\n$$k \\cdot D_{adj} = D_0$$\nSolving for the adjusted daily dose:\n$$D_{adj} = \\frac{D_0}{k} = \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{1.5} = \\frac{200}{3}\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,day^{-1}}$$\n\n$5.$ Calculate the adjusted amount per dose, $d_{adj}$:\nThis adjusted daily dose must also be divided into two equal administrations.\n$$d_{adj} = \\frac{D_{adj}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{200}{3}\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\right) = \\frac{100}{3}\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\n$6.$ Calculate the final adjusted volume per dose, $V_{adj}$:\nThe pharmacy supplies an oral solution with concentration $C = 100\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,mL^{-1}}$. The volume required for the adjusted dose $d_{adj}$ is given by:\n$$V_{adj} = \\frac{d_{adj}}{C} = \\frac{\\frac{100}{3}\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{100\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,mL^{-1}}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\n$7.$ Round the final answer as required:\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$V_{adj} = \\frac{1}{3}\\,\\mathrm{mL} \\approx 0.3333... \\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $0.333\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\n#### Part 2: Monitoring Plan Justification from First Principles\n\nCyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor with a narrow therapeutic index, where the risk of toxicity is closely related to systemic exposure (AUC). The monitoring plan must be designed to detect its primary, well-characterized toxicities early.\n\n**1. Blood Pressure (BP) Monitoring**\n-   **First Principles Justification:** Cyclosporine induces dose-dependent hypertension. The mechanism is multifactorial, but primarily involves renal afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, leading to pre-glomerular ischemia and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. It also promotes sodium and water retention. This combined effect increases systemic vascular resistance and intravascular volume, elevating blood pressure. Children are susceptible to this effect. Hypertension is both a marker of excessive drug effect and a risk factor for cardiovascular and renal damage.\n-   **Monitoring Plan and Decision Rules:**\n    *   **Baseline:** Measure BP before initiating therapy. Obtain at least three separate readings to establish a reliable baseline.\n    *   **Timing:** Monitor BP at each clinical visit. Initially, this should be weekly for the first month after initiation or any dose change. Once the dose and BP are stable, monitoring frequency can be reduced to every $2$-$4$ weeks.\n    *   **Decision Rule:** For a $12$-year-old, hypertension is defined as a sustained BP $\\geq 95$th percentile for age, sex, and height, or an absolute value $\\geq 130/80\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$. If hypertension is detected and confirmed, a dose reduction of cyclosporine (e.g., by $25\\%$) is the first-line intervention. If hypertension persists, initiation of antihypertensive therapy, preferably with a calcium channel blocker (e.g., amlodipine) which may counteract the afferent vasoconstriction, is indicated.\n\n**2. Serum Creatinine (SCr) Monitoring**\n-   **First Principles Justification:** Nephrotoxicity is the most critical dose-limiting toxicity of cyclosporine. The same vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole that contributes to hypertension causes a reduction in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This is a hemodynamic effect and is initially reversible. It manifests as an increase in serum creatinine (SCr), a marker of reduced GFR. Sustained high exposure can lead to chronic, irreversible tubulointerstitial fibrosis and permanent renal dysfunction. Monitoring SCr is a direct surrogate for monitoring this critical toxicity.\n-   **Monitoring Plan and Decision Rules:**\n    *   **Baseline:** A baseline SCr level must be measured before starting treatment.\n    *   **Timing:** Monitor SCr weekly for the first month. If stable, the frequency can be decreased to every $2$-$4$ weeks. Monitoring must be intensified following any dose adjustment or the addition of a new medication with nephrotoxic potential (e.g., NSAIDs).\n    *   **Decision Rule:** A clinically significant increase in SCr is typically defined as a rise of $\\geq 30\\%$ from the baseline value. If such an increase is observed and confirmed on a repeat test, it mandates an immediate dose reduction of cyclosporine (e.g., by $25-50\\%$) or temporary discontinuation. The dose should only be re-escalated after SCr returns to an acceptable level. This rule is crucial to prevent the transition from reversible hemodynamic changes to irreversible structural kidney damage.\n\n**3. Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) Management**\n-   **First Principles Justification:** Cyclosporine bioavailability and clearance are governed predominantly by the activity of the CYP3A4 enzyme system in the intestinal wall and liver. Its pharmacokinetics are therefore highly susceptible to modulation by other agents. CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, grapefruit juice) decrease cyclosporine metabolism, leading to increased exposure and toxicity risk. Conversely, CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, St. John's wort) increase metabolism, leading to decreased exposure, sub-therapeutic levels, and potential loss of efficacy.\n-   **Monitoring Plan and Decision Rules:**\n    *   **Baseline and Ongoing Review:** A comprehensive medication history, including all prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal products, is mandatory at baseline and must be reviewed at every patient encounter.\n    *   **Decision Rule for Initiating or Stopping an Interacting Drug:**\n        -   When a known CYP3A4 inhibitor is *started* (as in the problem), a proactive, empirically-guided dose reduction of cyclosporine (as calculated in Part 1) is necessary. This must be accompanied by heightened clinical and laboratory monitoring (BP, SCr).\n        -   When a known CYP3A4 inhibitor is *stopped*, the cyclosporine dose must be increased back to its pre-interaction level to avoid sub-therapeutic exposure and treatment failure. This change must also be monitored closely.\n        -   When a CYP3A4 *inducer* is started, a cyclosporine dose increase is likely required to maintain efficacy. When an inducer is stopped, a dose reduction is necessary to prevent toxicity.\n        -   Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of cyclosporine trough levels ($C_0$) or $2$-hour post-dose levels ($C_2$) can provide a quantitative measure of exposure to guide these adjustments more precisely, if available and clinically indicated.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.333}\n$$", "id": "5197646"}]}
