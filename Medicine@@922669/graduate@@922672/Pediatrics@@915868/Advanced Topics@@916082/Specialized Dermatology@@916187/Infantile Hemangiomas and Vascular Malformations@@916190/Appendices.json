The distinction between infantile hemangiomas (IH) and congenital hemangiomas (CH) based on clinical course (postnatal proliferation vs. fully formed at birth) and immunohistochemical markers (GLUT$1$ positivity vs. negativity) is a fundamental and well-accepted concept. The subtypes of CH (RICH, NICH, PICH) are also standard classifications. The clinical description is consistent with known presentations of these vascular anomalies.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear, detailed clinical scenario and sufficient, specific data (presence at birth, lack of proliferation, GLUT$1$ status) to allow for a differential diagnosis and arrival at a single most-likely answer. The question is unambiguous.\n-   **Objectivity:** The description uses standard, objective clinical terminology. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to proceed with a solution.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe primary task is to differentiate between the major types of vascular hemangiomas of infancy based on the provided data.\n\n1.  **Infantile Hemangioma (IH) vs. Congenital Hemangioma (CH):**\n    The key distinguishing features are provided in the problem statement.\n    -   **Clinical Course:** The lesion was \"fully formed at birth\" and demonstrated \"no history of interval postnatal proliferation.\" This clinical history is the defining characteristic of a congenital hemangioma (CH). In contrast, infantile hemangiomas (IH) are typically absent or present as a subtle precursor lesion at birth, followed by a period of rapid growth (proliferation) during the first several weeks to months of life.\n    -   **Immunohistochemistry:** The biopsy was \"negative for glucose transporter-$1$ (GLUT$1$) expression.\" This is the pathognomonic molecular marker that separates these entities. CHs are GLUT$1$-negative, whereas IHs are GLUT$1$-positive.\n\n    Based on these two definitive criteria, the lesion is a congenital hemangioma, not an infantile hemangioma.\n\n2.  **Subclassification of Congenital Hemangioma (CH):**\n    CHs are classified into three subtypes based on their natural history:\n    -   **Rapidly Involuting Congenital Hemangioma (RICH):** Fully formed at birth, undergoes rapid regression and is often completely involuted by 6 to 14 months of age.\n    -   **Non-Involuting Congenital Hemangioma (NICH):** Fully formed at birth, persists indefinitely, and grows proportionately with the child. It does not involute.\n    -   **Partially Involuting Congenital Hemangioma (PICH):** Exhibits features of both RICH and NICH. It partially involutes during the first year or two of life, but a residual plaque remains and persists, similar to a NICH.\n\n3.  **Assignment of Subtype and Prediction of Natural History:**\n    The problem provides specific morphological clues that point towards the most likely subtype. The description of a \"violaceous, dome-shaped plaque\" with a \"coarse telangiectatic rim\" and, most notably, \"multiple firm, pale central nodules\" is highly characteristic of a RICH. The pale central areas are clinically interpreted as signs of early involution, fibrosis, or thrombosis, which may have already begun *in utero*. Given these classic clinical features, the most probable diagnosis is RICH. Therefore, the predicted natural history is one of rapid and marked regression during the first year of life.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A. Infantile hemangioma; proliferative growth during the first $4$ to $5$ months followed by gradual involution over several years; GLUT$1$ positive**\n    -   This option is fundamentally incorrect. The problem statement explicitly provides three pieces of evidence that rule out an infantile hemangioma: the lesion was fully formed at birth, it did not proliferate postnatally, and it was GLUT$1$-negative.\n    -   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n-   **B. Rapidly involuting congenital hemangioma (RICH); marked regression within the first $6$ to $14$ months, often leaving atrophic skin, residual telangiectasia, and fatty replacement**\n    -   This option correctly identifies the lesion as a congenital hemangioma based on the provided data. It further subclassifies it as a RICH, which is strongly supported by the classic clinical presentation (especially the pale central nodules suggesting early involution). The described natural history of \"marked regression within the first $6$ to $14$ months\" is the defining characteristic of a RICH.\n    -   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n-   **C. Non-involuting congenital hemangioma (NICH); minimal to no decrease in size, with proportional growth commensurate with the child over time**\n    -   This option correctly identifies the lesion as a congenital hemangioma but assigns it to the NICH subtype. While NICH is in the differential, the presence of \"firm, pale central nodules\" makes an involuting process more likely. Therefore, RICH is a better fit for the described morphology. The predicted natural history corresponds to a NICH but is less likely than that of a RICH for this specific presentation.\n    -   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n-   **D. Partially involuting congenital hemangioma (PICH); partial size reduction during the first $12$ to $24$ months followed by a plateau with stable residual tissue**\n    -   This option identifies the lesion as a PICH. While any CH could theoretically turn out to be a PICH, this diagnosis is typically made retrospectively after observing incomplete involution. Prospectively, based on the classic features highly suggestive of involution (pale nodules), the most appropriate and likely initial diagnosis is RICH, with its corresponding expectation of complete, rapid regression.\n    -   **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5159839"}, {"introduction": "Following the diagnosis of a proliferative infantile hemangioma requiring systemic therapy, safe and effective treatment initiation is paramount.

The calculation is based on principles of mass-based pediatric pharmacotherapy.\n\nFirst, we identify the key parameters provided in the problem statement required for the calculation:\n1.  The target dosing regimen, which we denote as $R$. This is given as $R = 3 \\ \\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$.\n2.  The child's new weight, which we denote as $W$. This is given as $W = 7.5 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$.

The number of administrations per day, denoted as $n$. The medication is administered three times daily (TID), so $n = 3$.\n\nThe primary principle of mass-based dosing is that the total amount of medication administered over a period, typically a day, is directly proportional to the patient's body mass. The total daily dose, which we will call $D_{\\text{total}}$, is calculated by multiplying the target regimen $R$ by the child's weight $W$.\n\nThe formula for the total daily dose is:\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = R \\times W$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = (3 \\ \\mathrm{mg/kg/day}) \\times (7.5 \\ \\mathrm{kg})$$\n\nThe kilograms ($\\mathrm{kg}$) units cancel, resulting in a total daily dose in milligrams per day ($\\mathrm{mg/day}$):\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = 22.5 \\ \\mathrm{mg/day}$$\n\nNext, the problem states that this total daily dose is to be divided into three equal doses administered throughout the day. The per-dose amount, which we denote as $D_{\\text{dose}}$, is found by dividing the total daily dose $D_{\\text{total}}$ by the number of administrations per day, $n$.\n\nThe formula for the per-dose amount is:\n$$D_{\\text{dose}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{total}}}{n}$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated total daily dose and the given number of administrations:\n$$D_{\\text{dose}} = \\frac{22.5 \\ \\mathrm{mg/day}}{3 \\ \\text{doses/day}}$$\n\nAlternatively, one can combine these steps into a single expression:\n$$D_{\\text{dose}} = \\frac{R \\times W}{n} = \\frac{(3 \\ \\mathrm{mg/kg/day}) \\times (7.5 \\ \\mathrm{kg})}{3 \\ \\text{doses/day}}$$\n\nThe numerical factor of $3$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out, simplifying the calculation directly to:\n$$D_{\\text{dose}} = 7.5 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dose}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $7.5$.

By applying mathematical models, we can gain a more profound, quantitative understanding of a lesion's regression dynamics and predict its future course.

It is a well-formulated question in applied mathematics, specifically the modeling of a biological process with a differential equation. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core hypothesis is that the instantaneous rate of volume change, $\\frac{dV}{dt}$, is proportional to the current volume, $V(t)$. Since the volume is decreasing (regression), the proportionality constant must be negative. Let this constant be $-k$, where $k$ is a positive regression constant with units of inverse time (weeks$^{-1}$). The governing differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = -k V(t)\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{V} dV = -k \\, dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to a general time $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{V(0)}^{V(t)} \\frac{1}{V'} dV' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt'\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln(V')]_{V(0)}^{V(t)} = [-kt']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(V(t)) - \\ln(V(0)) = -kt\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{V(t)}{V(0)}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nGiven the initial condition $V(0) = V_{0}$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{V(t)}{V_{0}}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nTo find the functional form of $V(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{V(t)}{V_{0}} = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\n$$\nV(t) = V_{0} \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis is the functional form for the volume as a function of time, representing exponential decay.\n\nNext, we must determine the regression constant $k$ using the follow-up data provided: $V(6) = 0.70\\,V_{0}$. We substitute $t=6$ into our derived function:\n$$\nV(6) = V_{0} \\exp(-k \\cdot 6)\n$$\nSetting this equal to the measured value:\n$$\n0.70\\,V_{0} = V_{0} \\exp(-6k)\n$$\nSince $V_0$ is strictly positive, we can divide both sides by $V_0$:\n$$\n0.70 = \\exp(-6k)\n$$\nTo solve for $k$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(0.70) = -6k\n$$\n$$\nk = -\\frac{\\ln(0.70)}{6} = \\frac{\\ln(1/0.70)}{6} = \\frac{\\ln(10/7)}{6}\n$$\nThe regression constant $k$ is therefore $\\frac{\\ln(10) - \\ln(7)}{6}$ weeks$^{-1}$.\n\nFinally, we need to find the time $T$ at which the volume reaches $10\\%$ of its initial value, i.e., $V(T) = 0.10\\,V_{0}$.
