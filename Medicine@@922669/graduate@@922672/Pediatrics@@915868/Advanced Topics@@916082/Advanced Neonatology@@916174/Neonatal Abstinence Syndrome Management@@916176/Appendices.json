A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying the two foundational principles stated in the problem.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total mass of morphine to be administered for a single dose, denoted by $D$. The problem states that the dose scales in direct proportion to body mass. This relationship is formalized by the dose rate, $D_R$. The total dose $D$ is the product of the infant's mass $m$ and the dose rate $D_R$.\n$$D = m \\times D_R$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$D = (3.2\\,\\mathrm{kg}) \\times (0.06\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg})$$\nThe kilograms ($\\mathrm{kg}$) unit cancels, leaving the dose in milligrams ($\\mathrm{mg}$).\n$$D = 0.192\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the volume of the morphine solution to be administered, denoted by $V$. The problem defines concentration, $C$, as the amount of solute per unit volume. The amount of solute in this case is the total dose $D$.\n$$C = \\frac{D}{V}$$\nTo find the volume $V$, we rearrange this equation:\n$$V = \\frac{D}{C}$$\nSubstituting the calculated dose $D$ and the given concentration $C$:\n$$V = \\frac{0.192\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{0.4\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}}$$\nThe milligrams ($\\mathrm{mg}$) unit cancels, leaving the volume in milliliters ($\\mathrm{mL}$).\n$$V = 0.48\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nFinally, the problem requires that both results be rounded to $2$ significant figures.\n- For the dose $D = 0.192\\,\\mathrm{mg}$: The first two significant figures are $1$ and $9$. The third digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down. The rounded dose is $0.19\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n- For the volume $V = 0.48\\,\\mathrm{mL}$: This value already has exactly two significant figures ($4$ and $8$), so no further rounding is necessary.

The grand total is $N=60$.\n\nThe observed proportional agreement, $p_o$, is the sum of the counts on the main diagonal (where both raters agreed) divided by the total number of subjects.\nThe counts for agreement are $15$ (A-A), $17$ (I-I), and $8$ (M-M).\n$$ p_o = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} C_{ii}}{N} = \\frac{15 + 17 + 8}{60} = \\frac{40}{60} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the probability of chance agreement, $p_e$. This is the sum of the products of the marginal probabilities for each category. The marginal probability for a rater choosing a specific category is the marginal total for that category divided by the grand total $N$.\nLet $P_{A,i}$ be the proportion of times Rater A chose category $i$, and $P_{B,i}$ be the proportion for Rater B.\nThe marginal proportions for Rater A are:\n$$ P_{A,A} = \\frac{n_{A,A}}{N} = \\frac{22}{60} $$\n$$ P_{A,I} = \\frac{n_{A,I}}{N} = \\frac{25}{60} $$\n$$ P_{A,M} = \\frac{n_{A,M}}{N} = \\frac{13}{60} $$\nThe marginal proportions for Rater B are:\n$$ P_{B,A} = \\frac{n_{B,A}}{N} = \\frac{18}{60} $$\n$$ P_{B,I} = \\frac{n_{B,I}}{N} = \\frac{28}{60} $$\n$$ P_{B,M} = \\frac{n_{B,M}}{N} = \\frac{14}{60} $$\n\nThe expected chance agreement, $p_e$, is the sum of the probabilities that both raters select the same category by chance, assuming their ratings are independent.\n$$ p_e = \\sum_{i \\in \\{A,I,M\\}} P_{A,i} \\cdot P_{B,i} $$\n$$ p_e = \\left(\\frac{22}{60}\\right)\\left(\\frac{18}{60}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{25}{60}\\right)\\left(\\frac{28}{60}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{13}{60}\\right)\\left(\\frac{14}{60}\\right) $$\n$$ p_e = \\frac{(22)(18) + (25)(28) + (13)(14)}{60^2} $$\n$$ p_e = \\frac{396 + 700 + 182}{3600} = \\frac{1278}{3600} $$\n\nNow, substitute $p_o$ and $p_e$ into the kappa formula:\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{p_o - p_e}{1 - p_e} $$\nTo work with a common denominator, we express $p_o$ as:\n$$ p_o = \\frac{40}{60} = \\frac{40 \\times 60}{60 \\times 60} = \\frac{2400}{3600} $$\nSubstituting the fractional forms:\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{\\frac{2400}{3600} - \\frac{1278}{3600}}{1 - \\frac{1278}{3600}} = \\frac{\\frac{2400 - 1278}{3600}}{\\frac{3600 - 1278}{3600}} $$\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{1122}{2322} $$\nTo obtain the required numerical value, we perform the division:\n$$ \\kappa \\approx 0.48320413... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.4832$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4832}$$", "id": "5173270"}, {"introduction": "Successfully weaning a neonate from opioid therapy requires a systematic and predictable approach to dose reduction.

It contains no inconsistencies, missing information, or logical flaws. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**.
