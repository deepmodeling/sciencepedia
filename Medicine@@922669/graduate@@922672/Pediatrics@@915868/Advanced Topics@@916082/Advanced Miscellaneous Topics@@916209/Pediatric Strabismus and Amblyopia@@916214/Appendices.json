The solution is executed by first calculating the deviation in prism diopters ($\\mathrm{PD}$) and subsequently converting this value to an angular measure in degrees using the provided definition.\n\nFirst, we calculate the magnitude of the ocular deviation in prism diopters, denoted by $\\Delta$. The problem provides the decentration of the corneal light reflex, $d = 2\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, and the Hirschberg coefficient, $k_H = 22\\ \\mathrm{prism\\ diopters/mm}$. The Hirschberg coefficient provides a linear relationship between the measured decentration and the magnitude of the strabismic deviation in prism diopters. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$\n\\Delta = d \\times k_H\n$$\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n$$\n\\Delta = (2\\ \\mathrm{mm}) \\times \\left(22\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{PD}}{\\mathrm{mm}}\\right) = 44\\ \\mathrm{PD}\n$$\nThus, the magnitude of the ocular deviation is $44$ prism diopters. The observation of a *temporal* decentration indicates an *exotropia*, which is an outward deviation of the eye, but the problem only asks for the magnitude of the angle.\n\nNext, we convert the deviation from prism diopters to degrees. The problem states that $1\\ \\mathrm{PD}$ is defined as a deviation of a light ray by a displacement of $h = 1\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ at a distance of $D = 1\\ \\mathrm{m}$. We can formalize this with trigonometry. Let $\\theta$ be the angle of deviation. For a deviation of $\\Delta$ prism diopters, the displacement of the light ray at a distance $D = 1\\ \\mathrm{m}$ is $h = \\Delta\\ \\mathrm{cm}$. To maintain consistent units, we express the distance $D$ in centimeters:\n$$\nD = 1\\ \\mathrm{m} = 100\\ \\mathrm{cm}\n$$\nThe relationship between the angle $\\theta$, the displacement $h$, and the distance $D$ describes a right-angled triangle, where the tangent of the angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side ($h$) to the length of the adjacent side ($D$):\n$$\n\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{h}{D}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $h$ (in terms of $\\Delta$) and $D$:\n$$\n\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\Delta\\ \\mathrm{cm}}{100\\ \\mathrm{cm}} = \\frac{\\Delta}{100}\n$$\nTo find the angle $\\theta$, we take the arctangent of this ratio:\n$$\n\\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{100}\\right)\n$$\nThis formula yields the angle in radians.

All necessary data and assumptions for a unique solution are provided.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the definition of the accommodative convergence to accommodation (AC/A) ratio. This ratio quantifies the amount of convergence (in-turning of the eyes) that is reflexively driven by a given amount of accommodation (focusing effort). The relationship is defined as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{AC}}{\\text{A}} = \\frac{\\Delta C_A}{\\Delta A}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta C_A$ is the change in accommodative convergence, measured in prism diopters (PD), and $\\Delta A$ is the change in accommodation, measured in diopters (D). An esodeviation, or inward turning of the eye, is by convention a positive value in this context.\n\nThe problem requires us to calculate the expected change in the near esodeviation, $\\Delta C_A$, induced by a prescribed lens. We can rearrange the defining equation to solve for this change:\n$$\n\\Delta C_A = \\left(\\frac{\\text{AC}}{\\text{A}}\\right) \\times \\Delta A\n$$\n\nThe givens are:\n1.

Therefore, when the child wears the $+2.50\\,\\text{D}$ add, the amount of accommodation they must exert is reduced by $2.50\\,\\text{D}$. This reduction is the change in accommodation, $\\Delta A$.\n$$\n\\Delta A = 2.50\\,\\text{D}\n$$\n\nWith the AC/A ratio and the change in accommodation known, we can calculate the change in accommodative convergence. This change in convergence directly corresponds to the change in the esodeviation, as the deviation in this case is driven by accommodation.\n$$\n\\Delta C_A = \\left(6\\,\\frac{\\text{PD}}{\\text{D}}\\right) \\times (2.50\\,\\text{D})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta C_A = 15\\,\\text{PD}\n$$\nThis result signifies a $15\\,\\text{PD}$ reduction in accommodative convergence. Since the child has an esotropia (an inward deviation), this reduction in convergence will cause a reduction in the magnitude of the inward deviation. Therefore, the expected change in the near esodeviation is a decrease of $15\\,\\text{PD}$.\n\nThe question also requests a brief discussion of the implications for the residual near angle. The child's initial near deviation is $30\\,\\text{PD}$. The calculated change induced by the $+2.50\\,\\text{D}$ add is a reduction of $15\\,\\text{PD}$. The predicted residual near esodeviation, $ET_{\\text{residual}}$, is:\n$$\nET_{\\text{residual}} = ET_{\\text{initial}} - \\Delta C_A = 30\\,\\text{PD} - 15\\,\\text{PD} = 15\\,\\text{PD}\n$$\nThis implies that while the bifocal add significantly reduces the esotropia at near, a residual esotropia of $15\\,\\text{PD}$ is expected to remain. This residual deviation indicates that the $+2.50\\,\\text{D}$ lens is insufficient to fully neutralize the near angle. This is a common clinical scenario, particularly in patients with high AC/A ratios, and may necessitate further treatment, such as a stronger add power or surgical intervention, to achieve proper eye alignment and binocular vision at near.

It presents a standard, albeit simplified, clinical model for calculating surgical dosage in strabismus correction.\n\nThe problem asks for two main outputs: first, a derivation of the general expression relating surgical correction to the recession amount for a bilateral symmetric procedure, and second, the specific calculation for the given case.\n\nThe fundamental principle is that for small angles, the corrective effect of a muscle recession is approximately linear. The unit of angular deviation, the prism diopter (PD), is defined as a deviation of $1$ centimeter at a distance of $1$ meter. This corresponds to an angle $\\theta$ such that $\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{100} = 0.01$. For small angles, $\\tan(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$ (in radians), making the prism diopter a nearly linear measure of angle.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the problem statement:\n- $\\Delta$ is the total target correction of the esotropia, measured in prism diopters (PD).\n- $R$ is the magnitude of the recession performed on a single medial rectus (MR) muscle, measured in millimeters (mm).\n- $k$ is the surgical dose-response constant, representing the correction in PD per millimeter of recession for a single muscle.\n- $N$ is the number of muscles operated on.\n\nThe problem states that the surgery is a symmetric bilateral medial rectus recession. This means two identical muscles (both medial recti) are operated on, and the recession amount $R$ is the same for each. Thus, $N=2$.\n\nThe core assumptions, as stipulated by the problem and standard clinical modeling, are:\n1.  **Linearity**: The corrective effect is directly proportional to the amount of recession. The correction achieved by recessing one muscle by $R$ mm is given by the product $k \\times R$.\n2.  **Additivity**: The total correction from operating on multiple muscles is the sum of the individual corrections.\n3.  **Symmetry**: The recession magnitude $R$ is identical for both the right and left medial rectus muscles.\n4.  **Comitance**: The esotropia of $40$ PD is constant across different gaze positions, justifying a single target correction value. This is given in the problem statement.\n\nBased on these principles, we can derive the required expression.\nThe correction from operating on a single MR muscle is $\\Delta_{\\text{single}} = k \\cdot R$.\nSince the procedure is bilateral ($N=2$) and the effects are additive, the total correction $\\Delta$ is the sum of the corrections from the right eye's MR and the left eye's MR.\n$$ \\Delta = \\Delta_{\\text{right MR}} + \\Delta_{\\text{left MR}} $$\nGiven the symmetric recession $R$ on both muscles, the correction from each is identical:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\text{right MR}} = k \\cdot R $$\n$$ \\Delta_{\\text{left MR}} = k \\cdot R $$\nTherefore, the total correction is:\n$$ \\Delta = (k \\cdot R) + (k \\cdot R) = 2kR $$\nThis equation is the general expression relating the total target correction $\\Delta$ to the symmetric recession amount per eye, $R$.\n\nNow, we apply this derived relationship to solve the specific problem.\nThe given values are:\n- Target correction: $\\Delta = 40$ PD.\n- Surgical dose-response: $k = 3$ PD per millimeter of recession per MR muscle.\n\nWe need to find the recession magnitude $R$ per eye.
