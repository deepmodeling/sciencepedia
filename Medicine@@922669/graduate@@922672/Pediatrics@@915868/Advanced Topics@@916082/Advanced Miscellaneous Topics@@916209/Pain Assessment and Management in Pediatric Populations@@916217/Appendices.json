For an opioid-naive, $5$-year-old child receiving a continuous morphine infusion post-operatively, the following parameters are essential:\n\n1.  **Respiratory Function:** This is the most critical monitoring domain due to the risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression.\n    - **Respiratory Rate (RR):** Frequent, regular counting of breaths per minute. A significant decrease from baseline is a warning sign.\n    - **Oxygen Saturation ($SpO_2$):** Continuous pulse oximetry is mandatory. A declining $SpO_2$ is a late sign of respiratory depression.\n    - **Work of Breathing:** Observation for signs of respiratory distress such as nasal flaring, retractions (subcostal, intercostal, suprasternal), or accessory muscle use.\n    - **Capnography (End-Tidal $CO_2$ Monitoring):** This provides the earliest indicator of hypoventilation and is considered a standard of care in many institutions for patients on opioid infusions.\n\n2.  **Sedation Level:** Over-sedation often precedes respiratory depression.\n    - **Validated Sedation Scale:** The patient's level of consciousness must be assessed regularly using an age-appropriate, validated tool. Examples for a $5$-year-old include the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS) or the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale adapted for pediatrics (p-RASS). The goal is a patient who is calm and comfortable but easily arousable.\n\n3.  **Pain Intensity:** The efficacy of the analgesia must be assessed.\n    - **Age-Appropriate Pain Scale:** For a $5$-year-old child, self-report is the gold standard. Validated scales such as the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) or the Wong-Baker FACES® Pain Rating Scale are appropriate. Assessments should be done at regular intervals and after any intervention.\n\n4.  **Other Potential Side Effects:** Monitoring should also include checks for common opioid side effects such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus (itching), and urinary retention.\n\nThese monitoring parameters should be assessed and documented at a frequency determined by hospital policy, typically every $1$ to $2$ hours for a patient on a continuous opioid infusion, with increased frequency at the start of therapy or after any dose change.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.060}$$", "id": "5180504"}, {"introduction": "A crucial aspect of comprehensive pain management is ensuring a smooth transition of care, often involving a switch from intravenous to oral analgesics.
