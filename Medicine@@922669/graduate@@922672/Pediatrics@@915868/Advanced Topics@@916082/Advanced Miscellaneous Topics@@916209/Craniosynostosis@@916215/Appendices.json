Using the conventional cephalic index definition in anthropometry (based on the ratio of maximum biparietal breadth to maximum occipitofrontal length scaled by a factor of $100$), compute the cephalic index ($\\text{CI}$).

Do not include the classification in the final answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the cephalic index for an infant and its classification and interpretation in the context of suspected craniosynostosis. The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed, using standard anthropometric definitions and plausible clinical data.\n\nThe cephalic index, denoted as $\\text{CI}$, is defined in clinical anthropometry as the ratio of the maximum biparietal breadth ($B$) to the maximum occipitofrontal length ($L$), scaled by a factor of $100$. The formula is:\n$$ \\text{CI} = 100 \\times \\frac{B}{L} $$\n\nThe problem provides the following measurements for the $8$-month-old infant:\n- Maximum biparietal breadth, $B = 105\\ \\text{mm}$\n- Maximum occipitofrontal length, $L = 140\\ \\text{mm}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the cephalic index yields:\n$$ \\text{CI} = 100 \\times \\frac{105\\ \\text{mm}}{140\\ \\text{mm}} $$\n\nThe units of millimeters ($\\text{mm}$) in the numerator and denominator cancel, resulting in a dimensionless quantity. The calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$ \\text{CI} = 100 \\times \\frac{105}{140} $$\n\nThe fraction $\\frac{105}{140}$ can be simplified by finding the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator. Both numbers are divisible by $35$, since $105 = 3 \\times 35$ and $140 = 4 \\times 35$.\n$$ \\frac{105}{140} = \\frac{3 \\times 35}{4 \\times 35} = \\frac{3}{4} $$\n\nThus, the calculation for the cephalic index becomes:\n$$ \\text{CI} = 100 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 75 $$\n\nNext, we use the provided classification scheme to assign a head-shape category:\n- Dolichocephaly if $\\text{CI} < 75$\n- Mesocephaly if $75 \\le \\text{CI} < 80$\n- Brachycephaly if $80 \\le \\text{CI} < 85$\n- Hyperbrachycephaly if $\\text{CI} \\ge 85$\n\nSince the calculated cephalic index is $\\text{CI} = 75$, the infant's head shape falls into the **Mesocephaly** category, as it satisfies the condition $75 \\le \\text{CI} < 80$.\n\nFinally, we interpret this finding in the context of craniosynostosis risk. Mesocephaly describes a head shape with proportions considered average or normative. Craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of cranial sutures, typically produces characteristic dysmorphic head shapes because growth is restricted perpendicular to the fused suture and is compensatory in parallel. For instance, sagittal synostosis, the most common form, restricts mediolateral growth, leading to an elongated, narrow skull (scaphocephaly), which is a severe form of dolichocephaly (low $\\text{CI}$). Conversely, bilateral coronal synostosis restricts anteroposterior growth, resulting in a wide, short skull (brachycephaly, with a high $\\text{CI}$). A finding of mesocephaly indicates that the overall cranial vault proportions are within the typical range. This objectively reduces the likelihood of craniosynostosis types that cause gross proportional distortions, such as isolated sagittal or bicoronal synostosis. However, it does not entirely rule out craniosynostosis, as subtle, complex, or multiple suture fusions may present differently. A normal cephalic index is a reassuring, but not definitive, piece of data in a comprehensive clinical evaluation for craniosynostosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{75}$$", "id": "5129192"}, {"introduction": "After an initial physical assessment, clinicians often turn to imaging studies to confirm a diagnosis, but no diagnostic test is perfect.

This is the complement of specificity.\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nThe objective is to calculate the post-test probability of having the disease, given a positive test result.

It can be calculated using the law of total probability, which marginalizes over the disease status:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nThis expression for $P(T^+)$ represents the sum of the probabilities of true positives and false positives.\n\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values into the expression for $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.90)(0.05) + (0.05)(0.95)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.045 + 0.0475$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.0925$$\n\nWith the total probability of a positive test calculated, we can now complete the calculation for $P(D | T^+)$ using Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{(0.90)(0.05)}{0.0925}$$\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{0.045}{0.0925}$$\n$$P(D | T^+) \\approx 0.48648648...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
