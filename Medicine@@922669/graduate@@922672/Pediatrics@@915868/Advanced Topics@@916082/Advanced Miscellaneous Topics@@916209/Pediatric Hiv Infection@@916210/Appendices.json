The principles involved—prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and Bayes' theorem—are fundamental concepts in biostatistics and epidemiology.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $H$: The event that an infant truly has HIV infection.\n- $H^c$: The event that an infant does not have HIV infection.\n- $T^+$: The event that the HIV PCR test result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the HIV PCR test result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1.  The prevalence of true HIV infection is $5\\%$. This is the prior probability of an infant having HIV, which we denote as $P(H)$.\n    $$P(H) = 0.05$$\n2.  The sensitivity of the test is $95\\%$. Sensitivity is the probability that the test is positive, given that the infant has the infection.\n    $$P(T^+ | H) = 0.95$$\n3.  The specificity of the test is $99\\%$. Specificity is the probability that the test is negative, given that the infant does not have the infection.\n    $$P(T^- | H^c) = 0.99$$\n\nFrom these given values, we can derive other necessary probabilities. The probability that an infant does not have HIV is the complement of the prevalence:\n$$P(H^c) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$$\nThe probability of a positive test result in an infant who does not have HIV is the complement of the specificity. This is also known as the false positive rate.\n$$P(T^+ | H^c) = 1 - P(T^- | H^c) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$$\n\nThe goal is to find the posterior probability that an infant with a positive PCR test truly has HIV infection. This is the conditional probability $P(H | T^+)$, also known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV).\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, this probability is given by:\n$$P(H | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | H) P(H)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, represents the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. We can calculate this using the law of total probability. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: a true positive (the infant has HIV and tests positive) or a false positive (the infant does not have HIV but tests positive).\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap H) + P(T^+ \\cap H^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | H) P(H) + P(T^+ | H^c) P(H^c)$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $P(T^+)$ back into the Bayes' theorem formula, we get the complete expression for the posterior probability we seek:\n$$P(H | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | H) P(H)}{P(T^+ | H) P(H) + P(T^+ | H^c) P(H^c)}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this formula:\n$$P(H) = 0.05$$\n$$P(H^c) = 0.95$$\n$$P(T^+ | H) = 0.95$$\n$$P(T^+ | H^c) = 0.01$$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$P(H | T^+) = \\frac{(0.95)(0.05)}{(0.95)(0.05) + (0.01)(0.95)}$$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator, which represents the probability of a true positive result in the population:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = 0.95 \\times 0.05 = 0.0475$$\n\nNext, calculate the terms in the denominator. The first term is the same as the numerator. The second term represents the probability of a false positive result in the population:\n$$\\text{Second term of denominator} = 0.01 \\times 0.95 = 0.0095$$\n\nThe denominator is the sum of these two probabilities, representing the total probability of a positive test:\n$$\\text{Denominator} = 0.0475 + 0.0095 = 0.0570$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio:\n$$P(H | T^+) = \\frac{0.0475}{0.0570}$$\n$$P(H | T^+) = 0.833333...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(H | T^+) \\approx 0.8333$$\nThis result signifies that even with a highly specific test, in a population with relatively low prevalence, a positive result indicates an $83.33\\%$ probability of the infant actually having the disease.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8333}$$", "id": "5185310"}, {"introduction": "Once an HIV diagnosis is confirmed, initiating antiretroviral therapy requires precise, weight-based dosing, a task often complicated by the practical constraints of fixed-dose combination tablets.

It presents a well-defined optimization problem grounded in a realistic clinical context. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n## SOLUTION\n\nThe problem requires us to find the minimal possible value for the maximum absolute fractional deviation from the target dose for two drugs, abacavir (ABC) and lamivudine (3TC), given a specific fixed-dose combination tablet.\n\nFirst, we calculate the target dose in milligrams ($mg$) for the child with body mass $m = 12\\,\\mathrm{kg}$. Let $D_{\\text{target}}$ be the target dose for one administration.\n\nFor abacavir (ABC), the target dosing is $d_{ABC} = 8\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$. The target dose is:\n$$D_{ABC, \\text{target}} = m \\times d_{ABC} = 12\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 8\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg} = 96\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nFor lamivudine (3TC), the target dosing is $d_{3TC} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$. The target dose is:\n$$D_{3TC, \\text{target}} = m \\times d_{3TC} = 12\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 5\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg} = 60\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThe available formulation is a fixed-dose tablet containing $60\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ of ABC and $30\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ of 3TC. The tablet is scored and can be split into two equal halves. This means the smallest unit of administration contains:\n-   ABC per half-tablet: $M_{ABC, \\text{half}} = \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{2} = 30\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n-   3TC per half-tablet: $M_{3TC, \\text{half}} = \\frac{30\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{2} = 15\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n\nThe dose must be an integer multiple of half-tablets. Let $n$ be the number of half-tablets administered, where $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$. The administered dose for each drug, $D_{\\text{admin}}(n)$, is a function of $n$:\n$$D_{ABC, \\text{admin}}(n) = n \\times M_{ABC, \\text{half}} = 30n\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n$$D_{3TC, \\text{admin}}(n) = n \\times M_{3TC, \\text{half}} = 15n\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThe absolute fractional deviation, $\\delta$, for each drug is defined as:\n$$\\delta(n) = \\frac{|D_{\\text{admin}}(n) - D_{\\text{target}}|}{D_{\\text{target}}}$$\n\nFor ABC, the absolute fractional deviation $\\delta_{ABC}(n)$ is:\n$$\\delta_{ABC}(n) = \\frac{|30n - 96|}{96}$$\n\nFor 3TC, the absolute fractional deviation $\\delta_{3TC}(n)$ is:\n$$\\delta_{3TC}(n) = \\frac{|15n - 60|}{60} = \\frac{15|n - 4|}{60} = \\frac{|n - 4|}{4}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal possible value of the maximum absolute fractional deviation across the two drugs. We want to find the value of:\n$$\\min_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+} \\left( \\max(\\delta_{ABC}(n), \\delta_{3TC}(n)) \\right)$$\n\nLet's evaluate this expression for integer values of $n$. The ideal (non-integer) values of $n$ would be $n_{ABC} = \\frac{96}{30} = 3.2$ for ABC and $n_{3TC} = \\frac{60}{15} = 4$ for 3TC. The optimal integer $n$ is likely to be close to these values, so we will test $n=3$ and $n=4$.\n\nFor $n=3$ (one and a half tablets):\n-   Administered ABC dose: $D_{ABC, \\text{admin}}(3) = 30 \\times 3 = 90\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n-   Administered 3TC dose: $D_{3TC, \\text{admin}}(3) = 15 \\times 3 = 45\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n-   Deviations:\n    $$\\delta_{ABC}(3) = \\frac{|90 - 96|}{96} = \\frac{6}{96} = \\frac{1}{16} = 0.0625$$\n    $$\\delta_{3TC}(3) = \\frac{|45 - 60|}{60} = \\frac{15}{60} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$$\n-   Maximum deviation for $n=3$: $\\max(0.0625, 0.25) = 0.25$\n\nFor $n=4$ (two full tablets):\n-   Administered ABC dose: $D_{ABC, \\text{admin}}(4) = 30 \\times 4 = 120\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n-   Administered 3TC dose: $D_{3TC, \\text{admin}}(4) = 15 \\times 4 = 60\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n-   Deviations:\n    $$\\delta_{ABC}(4) = \\frac{|120 - 96|}{96} = \\frac{24}{96} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$$\n    $$\\delta_{3TC}(4) = \\frac{|60 - 60|}{60} = \\frac{0}{60} = 0$$\n-   Maximum deviation for $n=4$: $\\max(0.25, 0) = 0.25$\n\nComparing the results for $n=3$ and $n=4$, the maximum deviation is $0.25$ in both cases. Let's examine $n=2$ and $n=5$ to confirm we have found the minimum.\n\nFor $n=2$: $\\max\\left(\\frac{|60 - 96|}{96}, \\frac{|2 - 4|}{4}\\right) = \\max\\left(\\frac{36}{96}, \\frac{2}{4}\\right) = \\max(0.375, 0.5) = 0.5$\nFor $n=5$: $\\max\\left(\\frac{|150 - 96|}{96}, \\frac{|5 - 4|}{4}\\right) = \\max\\left(\\frac{54}{96}, \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\max(0.5625, 0.25) = 0.5625$\n\nThe maximum deviation increases as we move further from $n=3$ and $n=4$. Therefore, the minimal value of the maximal deviation is $0.25$.\n\nThe problem states that for clinical safety, the acceptable fractional deviation is bounded by $0.10$. For $n=3$, $\\delta_{3TC}(3)=0.25>0.10$. For $n=4$, $\\delta_{ABC}(4)=0.25>0.10$. Thus, neither of these dosing options meets the specified clinical criterion for both drugs. However, the question asks for the \"minimal possible value of the maximal absolute fractional deviation\", which is a request to find the optimum of the mathematical objective function, regardless of whether that optimum satisfies the separate clinical constraint. The value $0.25$ represents the best achievable outcome given the constraints of the formulation.\n\nThe minimal maximal absolute fractional deviation is $0.25$.

No other major NRTI or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance mutations are detected. You are asked to predict the residual activity of tenofovir against this virus to guide selection between Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) and Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF) as part of a new regimen.\n\nUse the following foundational definitions and well-tested observations to reason from mechanism to phenotype:\n\n- HIV RT catalyzes viral complementary DNA synthesis. NRTIs act as competitive substrates that, once incorporated as analogs, terminate the nascent DNA chain. The phenotypic susceptibility to a drug can be summarized by the half-maximal inhibitory concentration, $IC_{50}$. A resistance mutation increases the $IC_{50}$ relative to wild-type. The fold-change is defined as $F = IC_{50,\\ \\text{mutant}} / IC_{50,\\ \\text{wild-type}}$. As a first-order approximation, residual antiviral activity is inversely related to $F$, such that the fractional residual activity is approximately $1/F$.\n- The K$65$R substitution in RT reduces incorporation of tenofovir diphosphate and typically increases the tenofovir $IC_{50}$ by about $2.5$-fold in vitro for both TDF- and TAF-derived intracellular tenofovir diphosphate.\n- Thymidine Analog Mutations (TAMs) selected by zidovudine or stavudine come in recognizable patterns. The TAM-$1$ pattern (M$41$L, L$210$W, T$215$Y) increases tenofovir $IC_{50}$ via cross-resistance, typically by about $1.8$-fold when at least two of these are present.\n- When K$65$R co-occurs with TAMs, antagonistic interaction has been observed: the net effect on tenofovir $IC_{50}$ is less than the simple product of individual fold-changes. A conservative, empirically grounded way to capture this is to scale the multiplicative expectation by a factor $a$ with $0 &lt; a &lt; 1$. For this genotype combination, assume $a \\approx 0.70$.\n- Tenofovir Alafenamide (TAF) and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) deliver the same active moiety, tenofovir diphosphate, intracellularly. TAF achieves higher intracellular levels at lower plasma exposures than TDF, but resistance substitutions that impair the interaction of tenofovir diphosphate with RT (for example, K$65$R and TAMs) affect both TDF- and TAF-derived tenofovir similarly, with any difference being quantitative rather than categorical.\n\nAssume wild-type $IC_{50}$ is normalized to $1.0$ arbitrary unit.

The mutations (K$65$R, TAMs), drugs (TDF, TAF), mechanism of action of NRTIs, concepts of $IC_{50}$, fold-change, and mutational antagonism are all standard and well-documented in the field of HIV medicine. The quantitative values provided for fold-changes and the antagonism factor are consistent with data from genotypic-phenotypic correlation studies.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear set of initial conditions (the genotype), a quantitative model to process these conditions (the rules for calculating fold-change), and a specific question to answer (predict residual activity and choose between TDF/TAF). All necessary information is provided to derive a unique solution based on the given model.\n- **Objective:** The language is clinical, technical, and precise, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Flaw Checklist:**\n    - No scientific or factual unsoundness is present.\n    - The problem is formalizable and directly relevant to the topic.\n    - The setup is complete and internally consistent.\n    - The scenario is realistic and clinically plausible.\n    - The problem structure allows for a unique and stable solution based on the premises.\n    - The problem is not trivial; it requires the integration of multiple data points and an understanding of their interaction.\n    - The claims are based on verifiable scientific observations.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will proceed.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires us to calculate the total fold-change ($F_{net}$) in tenofovir $IC_{50}$ resulting from the given combination of mutations and then interpret the clinical implications.\n\n1.  **Identify the individual fold-change contributions:**\n    - The K$65$R mutation contributes a fold-change of $F_{K65R} \\approx 2.5$.\n    - The patient's virus has the M$41$L, L$210$W, and T$215$Y mutations. This is the TAM-$1$ pattern, and since all three mutations are present (which is more than the required \"at least two\"), this pattern contributes a fold-change of $F_{TAMs} \\approx 1.8$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the simple multiplicative fold-change:**\n    Without considering any interaction, the combined effect would be the product of the individual effects:\n    $$F_{mult} = F_{K65R} \\times F_{TAMs} \\approx 2.5 \\times 1.8 = 4.5$$\n\n3.  **Apply the antagonistic interaction factor:**\n    The problem states that when K$65$R and TAMs co-occur, there is an antagonistic interaction that scales the multiplicative expectation by a factor of $a \\approx 0.70$.\n    $$F_{net} = F_{mult} \\times a \\approx 4.5 \\times 0.70 = 3.15$$\n    So, the net fold-change in $IC_{50}$ is approximately $3.15$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the residual activity:**\n    The fractional residual activity is approximated as the reciprocal of the net fold-change:\n    $$\\text{Residual Activity} \\approx \\frac{1}{F_{net}} \\approx \\frac{1}{3.15} \\approx 0.317$$\n    This corresponds to approximately $31.7\\%$ of the activity against a wild-type virus.\n\n5.  **Interpret the clinical implications:**\n    - A fold-change of $3.15$ indicates a significant loss of susceptibility, but not complete resistance. This level is typically categorized as intermediate or partial resistance. Tenofovir is expected to have some, but reduced, antiviral effect.\n    - Given this partial activity, tenofovir (in either form, TDF or TAF) should not be relied on as a primary suppressive agent. Instead, it can contribute to viral suppression as part of a combination regimen that includes other fully active agents, particularly one with a high barrier to resistance (e.g., dolutegravir, boosted darunavir) to prevent further resistance development.\n    - The problem states that TAF achieves higher intracellular concentrations of the active tenofovir diphosphate. In the face of partial resistance, these higher drug levels can help to overcome the reduced enzyme affinity, potentially providing a greater \"functional\" or effective antiviral activity in vivo compared to TDF. Therefore, TAF may be a preferable choice over TDF in this specific context.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The combined fold-change is approximately $3.2$, implying partial residual activity (about $30\\%$ of wild-type). TAF may retain slightly more functional activity than TDF owing to higher intracellular tenofovir diphosphate, but both should be used only to contribute activity within a regimen anchored by a high-barrier agent.**\n\n- The calculated fold-change is $F_{net} = 3.15$, which is well-approximated by $3.2$.\n- The calculated residual activity is $\\approx 31.7\\%$, which is well-approximated by $30\\%$.\n- The clinical interpretation aligns perfectly with our derivation: the resistance is partial, tenofovir can contribute activity but requires a strong regimen backbone (a \"high-barrier agent\"), and TAF is likely a better choice than TDF due to its pharmacological advantage.\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The combined fold-change is approximately $4.5$, implying no meaningful residual activity; both TDF and TAF should be avoided entirely.**\n\n- This option uses the simple multiplicative fold-change ($2.5 \\times 1.8 = 4.5$) but fails to account for the explicitly stated antagonistic interaction factor $a \\approx 0.70$. The calculation is therefore incorrect according to the problem's premises.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The combined fold-change is approximately $2.5$, implying near-wild-type activity; TDF could function as the principal suppressive agent without the need for a high-barrier anchor.**\n\n- This option incorrectly considers only the fold-change from the K$65$R mutation ($2.5$) and ignores the contribution of the TAMs ($1.8$) and the antagonism ($0.70$). The calculation is incomplete. Furthermore, a fold-change of $2.5$ is not \"near-wild-type activity\"; it represents a clinically significant degree of resistance. The clinical advice is therefore also flawed.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The combined fold-change is less than $1.0$ due to antagonism, implying hypersusceptibility; TDF activity is enhanced and superior to TAF in this setting.**\n\n- This option misinterprets the meaning of antagonism. Antagonism in this context means the combined resistance effect is *less than* the multiplicative product, not that it reverses the effect into hypersusceptibility ($F < 1.0$). Our calculation shows $F_{net} = 3.15$, which is much greater than $1.0$. The conclusion of hypersusceptibility is false. The claim that TDF is superior to TAF contradicts the pharmacological principle that TAF's higher intracellular concentrations are an advantage against partially resistant virus.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5185360"}]}
