Let $R_1$ denote the risk (or incidence proportion over a fixed time window) of pediatric asthma among exposed children, and let $R_0$ denote the risk among unexposed children. By definition, the relative risk (RR) is\n$$\nRR = \\frac{R_1}{R_0}.\n$$\nLet $p_e$ denote the prevalence of exposure in the population. The overall population risk $R$ is a mixture of risks in exposed and unexposed strata:\n$$\nR = p_e R_1 + (1 - p_e) R_0.\n$$\nThe population attributable fraction (PAF) is defined as the proportion of the observed population risk that would be eliminated if the exposure were removed (under the assumptions of causality and no other changes). Let $R^{\\ast}$ denote the counterfactual population risk if no one were exposed. Under exchangeability and consistency assumptions, $R^{\\ast} = R_0$.

The DiD estimator for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) is given by the change in the outcome in the treated group minus the change in the outcome in the control group.\n\nLet $r_{s,t}$ be the hospitalization rate per $100{,}000$ children in state $s \\in \\{T, C\\}$ and time period $t \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\nThe rates are calculated as $r_{s,t} = \\frac{H_{s,t}}{N_{s,t}} \\times 100{,}000$.\n\n-   $r_{T,1} = \\frac{120}{400{,}000} \\times 100{,}000 = 30.0$\n-   $r_{T,2} = \\frac{80}{402{,}000} \\times 100{,}000 \\approx 19.900$\n-   $r_{C,1} = \\frac{150}{500{,}000} \\times 100{,}000 = 30.0$\n-   $r_{C,2} = \\frac{140}{505{,}000} \\times 100{,}000 \\approx 27.723$\n\nThe DiD estimate is $\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{DiD}} = (r_{T,2} - r_{T,1}) - (r_{C,2} - r_{C,1})$.\n\n**A. The unbiased difference-in-differences point estimate of the law’s effect on the hospitalization rate per $100{,}000$ children is the difference of the pre-post change in the treated state minus the pre-post change in the control state, computed on rates that scale counts by child population. With the given data, this estimate is approximately $-7.8$ per $100{,}000$.**\n\nThe statement correctly defines the DiD estimator. Let us perform the calculation:\nChange in treated state: $\\Delta_T = r_{T,2} - r_{T,1} \\approx 19.900 - 30.0 = -10.100$.\nChange in control state: $\\Delta_C = r_{C,2} - r_{C,1} \\approx 27.723 - 30.0 = -2.277$.\nThe DiD estimate is:\n$$ \\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{DiD}} = \\Delta_T - \\Delta_C \\approx -10.100 - (-2.277) = -7.823 $$\nThe calculated value is approximately $-7.8$ per $100{,}000$ children. The methodological description and the calculation are both correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The parallel trends assumption requires the pre-policy levels of hospitalization rates to be identical across states; if levels differ at baseline, difference-in-differences is invalid.**\n\nThis statement fundamentally misrepresents the parallel trends assumption. The assumption pertains to the *trends* (i.e., changes over time), not the *levels* of the outcome. The assumption is that, in the absence of treatment, the change in the outcome in the treated group would have been the same as the change in the outcome in the control group: $E[Y_{T,2}(0) - Y_{T,1}(0) | T=1] = E[Y_{C,2}(0) - Y_{C,1}(0) | C=1]$, where $Y(0)$ is the potential outcome without treatment. DiD is specifically designed to be valid even when baseline levels differ, as it differences out these time-invariant level differences.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. An appropriate regression implementation uses a Poisson generalized linear model with a log link and an offset for the log of the child population, including indicators for treated state, post period, and their interaction; the interaction coefficient estimates the law’s effect on the log rate.**\n\nThis describes the standard and correct regression framework for a DiD analysis with count data and varying exposures. The model for the expected count $E[H_{st}]$ for state $s$ at time $t$ is:\n$$ \\log(E[H_{st}]) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot \\text{Treated}_s + \\beta_2 \\cdot \\text{Post}_t + \\beta_3 \\cdot (\\text{Treated}_s \\times \\text{Post}_t) + \\log(N_{st}) $$\nHere, $\\log(N_{st})$ is the offset term, which correctly accounts for the exposure (population size). The coefficient on the interaction term, $\\beta_3$, is the DiD estimator for the effect on the log of the rate. It represents the difference in the change of the log rate between the treated and control groups. This is a canonical implementation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. With only two states and two periods, conventional cluster-robust standard errors clustered at the state level yield reliable inference; no special small-sample adjustments are needed.**\n\nThis statement is critically flawed. Cluster-robust standard errors (CRSEs) rely on asymptotic arguments where the number of clusters grows large. With only two clusters (the two states), the asymptotic justification completely breaks down. The between-cluster variance cannot be reliably estimated. Applying conventional CRSEs in this \"few clusters\" context will lead to standard errors that are severely biased (typically downward), resulting in unreliable and overconfident inference (i.e., artificially small p-values). Special methods, such as the wild cluster bootstrap, are specifically designed and necessary for inference in such settings. The claim that no special adjustments are needed is patently false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. A key diagnostic for the parallel trends assumption is an event-study examination of multiple pre-policy periods to test for differential pre-trends; if only one pre period is available, the team should augment the dataset with earlier pre years to enable this diagnostic.**\n\nThe parallel trends assumption is not directly testable since the counterfactual is unobservable. However, its plausibility can be assessed by examining trends in the outcome variable *before* the intervention. If the treated and control groups exhibited parallel trends in the pre-treatment periods, it lends credibility to the assumption that they would have continued to do so post-treatment, absent the intervention. This examination requires multiple pre-treatment data points. With only one pre-period, it is impossible to assess a pre-trend. Thus, the recommendation to collect data from earlier years to perform this diagnostic \"event-study\" analysis is a crucial and standard step for a robust DiD analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. Spillovers such as cross-border behavior changes (e.g., parents in the control state adopting booster seats due to media coverage from the treated state) do not threaten difference-in-differences validity because common shocks are already differenced out.**\n\nThis statement confuses two distinct concepts: spillovers and common shocks. A \"common shock\" affects both treated and control groups (e.g., a national safety campaign). DiD is designed to handle this. A \"spillover\" or \"interference\" effect, as described, is a violation of the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA). It means the treatment in the treated state affects the outcome in the control state. If the control group is \"contaminated\" by the treatment, it no longer serves as a valid counterfactual for what would have happened in the treated state without the law. This biases the DiD estimate, typically towards zero, because the change in the control group now partially reflects the treatment effect. Spillovers are a significant threat to the validity of the DiD design.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**G. To address potential compositional changes in the age distribution within $4$-$7$ years and to assess robustness, include age-year covariates or weights in a generalized linear model and examine sensitivity of the estimate to these controls as part of diagnostics.**\n\nThis is a statement about enhancing the robustness of the DiD model. The parallel trends assumption might only hold after controlling for certain covariates. If the composition of the population (e.g., the specific age distribution within the $4$–$7$ year-old bracket) is changing differently over time between the two states, and if this composition affects hospitalization rates, it can confound the DiD estimate. Including such covariates in the regression model (a \"DiD with covariates\" approach) or using weighting to standardize the populations makes the parallel trends assumption conditional on these factors, which is often more plausible. Examining the sensitivity of the main effect estimate to the inclusion of these controls is a standard and important form of robustness check in any applied analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACEG}$$", "id": "5115405"}]}
