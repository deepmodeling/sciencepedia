The team wishes to quantify the instantaneous risk of Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (PPROM) after fetoscopy under two plausible plans using a Cox proportional hazards framework. The Cox proportional hazards regression was previously fit to event time data for PPROM following fetoscopy across a range of gestational ages and procedural characteristics. The fitted model included two baseline covariates: gestational age at surgery (in weeks) and the number of instrument ports used. The estimated regression coefficients are $\\beta_{\\mathrm{GA}}=-0.15$ per additional week and $\\beta_{\\mathrm{ports}}=0.45$ per additional port.\n\nPlan A is a single-port technique performed at $22.0$ weeks of gestation.

The model for the hazard of PPROM is:\n$$h(t|GA, P) = h_0(t) \\exp(\\beta_{\\mathrm{GA}} \\cdot GA + \\beta_{\\mathrm{ports}} \\cdot P)$$\n\nWe are given the following coefficients:\n$\\beta_{\\mathrm{GA}} = -0.15$\n$\\beta_{\\mathrm{ports}} = 0.45$\n\nFor Plan A, the covariates are $GA_A = 22.0$ and $P_A = 1$. The hazard function for Plan A is:\n$$h_A(t) = h(t|GA_A, P_A) = h_0(t) \\exp(\\beta_{\\mathrm{GA}} \\cdot GA_A + \\beta_{\\mathrm{ports}} \\cdot P_A)$$\n$$h_A(t) = h_0(t) \\exp((-0.15)(22.0) + (0.45)(1))$$\n\nFor Plan B, the covariates are $GA_B = 20.5$ and $P_B = 2$. The hazard function for Plan B is:\n$$h_B(t) = h(t|GA_B, P_B) = h_0(t) \\exp(\\beta_{\\mathrm{GA}} \\cdot GA_B + \\beta_{\\mathrm{ports}} \\cdot P_B)$$\n$$h_B(t) = h_0(t) \\exp((-0.15)(20.5) + (0.45)(2))$$\n\nThe hazard ratio ($HR$) comparing Plan B to Plan A is the ratio of their respective hazard functions:\n$$HR = \\frac{h_B(t)}{h_A(t)} = \\frac{h_0(t) \\exp(\\beta_{\\mathrm{GA}} \\cdot GA_B + \\beta_{\\mathrm{ports}} \\cdot P_B)}{h_0(t) \\exp(\\beta_{\\mathrm{GA}} \\cdot GA_A + \\beta_{\\mathrm{ports}} \\cdot P_A)}$$\n\nThe baseline hazard function $h_0(t)$ cancels, demonstrating the proportional hazards assumption. Using the properties of exponential functions, we combine the terms:\n$$HR = \\exp\\left((\\beta_{\\mathrm{GA}} \\cdot GA_B + \\beta_{\\mathrm{ports}} \\cdot P_B) - (\\beta_{\\mathrm{GA}} \\cdot GA_A + \\beta_{\\mathrm{ports}} \\cdot P_A)\\right)$$\nRearranging the terms within the exponent:\n$$HR = \\exp\\left(\\beta_{\\mathrm{GA}}(GA_B - GA_A) + \\beta_{\\mathrm{ports}}(P_B - P_A)\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this derived expression:\n- $GA_A = 22.0$, $P_A = 1$\n- $GA_B = 20.5$, $P_B = 2$\n- $\\beta_{\\mathrm{GA}} = -0.15$\n- $\\beta_{\\mathrm{ports}} = 0.45$\n\n$$HR = \\exp\\left((-0.15)(20.5 - 22.0) + (0.45)(2 - 1)\\right)$$\nFirst, calculate the differences in covariates:\n- $GA_B - GA_A = 20.5 - 22.0 = -1.5$\n- $P_B - P_A = 2 - 1 = 1$\n\nSubstitute these differences back into the equation for $HR$:\n$$HR = \\exp\\left((-0.15)(-1.5) + (0.45)(1)\\right)$$\nCalculate the terms in the exponent:\n$$(-0.15)(-1.5) = 0.225$$\n$$(0.45)(1) = 0.45$$\nSum the terms in the exponent:\n$$0.225 + 0.45 = 0.675$$\nTherefore, the hazard ratio is:\n$$HR = \\exp(0.675)$$\nComputing the numerical value:\n$$HR \\approx 1.96403445$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four digits are $1, 9, 6, 4$. The fifth digit is $0$, so we round down.\n$$HR \\approx 1.964$$\nThe hazard ratio indicates that the instantaneous risk of PPROM under Plan B is approximately $1.964$ times the instantaneous risk under Plan A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.964}$$", "id": "5144310"}, {"introduction": "The successful execution of fetal surgery often depends on the precise application of biophysical principles to achieve a desired tissue effect.
