Therefore, the problem is scientifically sound.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem is unambiguous and provides all necessary information to calculate a unique solution.

The inclusion of the patient's weight is contextual information that does not create a contradiction or an overconstrained system, as the BSA is provided directly.\n*   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language, suitable for a formal calculation.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe calculation of the adjusted allopurinol dose is a two-step process. First, the unadjusted total daily dose is calculated based on the reference dose index and the patient's body surface area (BSA). Second, this dose is adjusted for the patient's moderate renal impairment.\n\nLet $D_{\\text{index}}$ be the reference dose index and $\\text{BSA}$ be the patient's body surface area.

A reduction of $50\\%$ means the final dose will be $100\\% - 50\\% = 50\\%$ of the unadjusted dose. Let this adjustment factor be $F_{\\text{adj}}$.\n$$ F_{\\text{adj}} = 1 - 0.50 = 0.50 $$\nThe adjusted total daily dose, $D_{\\text{adjusted}}$, is found by multiplying the unadjusted dose by this factor.\n$$ D_{\\text{adjusted}} = D_{\\text{unadjusted}} \\times F_{\\text{adj}} $$\nSubstituting the value of $D_{\\text{unadjusted}}$:\n$$ D_{\\text{adjusted}} = 300\\ \\text{mg}/\\text{day} \\times 0.50 $$\n$$ D_{\\text{adjusted}} = 150\\ \\text{mg}/\\text{day} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in $\\text{mg/day}$ and rounded to three significant figures.

Laboratory tumor lysis syndrome is present and clinical tumor lysis syndrome is established; initiate urgent renal replacement therapy (dialysis) and stop cytoreductive therapy immediately.", "solution": "The fundamental base for this problem is the pathophysiology of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and the Cairo–Bishop (and widely adopted modified) criteria for laboratory TLS. Rapid lysis of malignant cells releases intracellular contents, notably potassium, phosphate, and nucleic acids. Purine nucleic acids are catabolized to xanthine and then to uric acid via xanthine oxidase. The rise in serum phosphate can drive calcium phosphate precipitation, lowering ionized calcium and contributing to nephropathy. Uric acid and calcium phosphate can precipitate in renal tubules, causing acute kidney injury. These biochemical changes occur within a characteristic time window relative to initiation of cytotoxic therapy (including corticosteroids in highly steroid-responsive malignancies).\n\nThe Cairo–Bishop definition of laboratory TLS requires at least $2$ of the following abnormalities occurring within $3$ days before or within $7$ days after initiation of therapy: elevated serum uric acid, potassium, phosphate, or decreased calcium, defined by either an absolute threshold or a relative change of at least $25\\%$ from baseline. Commonly used thresholds include: uric acid $\\geq 8\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ or $\\geq 25\\%$ increase; potassium $\\geq 6.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$ or $\\geq 25\\%$ increase; phosphate $\\geq 6.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ in children or $\\geq 4.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ in adults, or $\\geq 25\\%$ increase; calcium $\\leq 7.0\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ or $\\geq 25\\%$ decrease. The modified Howard criteria remove the relative change component but preserve similar absolute thresholds; either approach will identify clinically important TLS.\n\nWe first test the laboratory values at $24$ hours:\n\n- Uric acid changed from $5\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ to $9\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. The absolute value $9\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ is $\\geq 8\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, satisfying the uric acid criterion. The relative change is\n$$\\frac{9 - 5}{5} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8 = 80\\%,$$\nwhich exceeds the $\\geq 25\\%$ increase criterion.\n\n- Potassium rose from $4.4\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$ to $5.4\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$. This is below the absolute threshold of $\\geq 6.0\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$, and the relative increase of $\\approx 22.7\\%$ is below the $25\\%$ threshold. The criterion is not met.\n\n- Phosphate is $6.7\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. In children, the threshold is $\\geq 6.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$; thus phosphate meets the criterion.\n\n- Calcium decreased from $9.2\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ to $7.8\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. The absolute value is above the $\\leq 7.0\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ threshold, and the relative decrease of $\\approx 15.2\\%$ is less than the required $25\\%$ decrease. The criterion is not met.\n\nTherefore, at least two laboratory criteria are met (uric acid and phosphate) within the appropriate temporal window ($24$ hours after therapy), so laboratory TLS is present.\n\nNext steps are guided by first principles of TLS management:\n\n- Aggressive isotonic intravenous hydration enhances renal perfusion and solute excretion. A common pediatric target is urine output $\\geq 3\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg/hr}$, generally achieved with fluids on the order of $2$–$3\\,\\mathrm{L/m^2/day}$, while avoiding potassium- or phosphate-containing solutions.\n\n- Rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase) catalyzes the conversion of uric acid to allantoin, which is more soluble, rapidly lowering serum uric acid and mitigating crystalluria risk. It addresses existing hyperuricemia, unlike allopurinol, which only prevents new uric acid formation. When rasburicase is initiated for established hyperuricemia, discontinuation of allopurinol is appropriate to avoid xanthine accumulation and because rasburicase obviates the need for uric acid formation blockade. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a contraindication due to risk of hemolysis and methemoglobinemia; in urgent situations, centers rapidly assess G6PD status, but the presence of laboratory TLS with rising uric acid generally prompts rasburicase unless G6PD deficiency is confirmed or highly suspected.\n\n- Frequent monitoring of electrolytes and uric acid every $4$–$6$ hours is needed. Because rasburicase can degrade uric acid ex vivo, samples should be placed on ice and processed promptly to prevent falsely low measurements.\n\n- Urine alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate is generally avoided in modern TLS management because it can promote calcium phosphate precipitation in renal tubules, exacerbating nephropathy.\n\n- Dialysis is reserved for refractory electrolyte disturbances (e.g., persistent hyperkalemia), symptomatic uremia, severe oligoanuric acute kidney injury with volume overload, or rising phosphorus/calcium phosphate product despite medical therapy. This child has creatinine $0.9\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ (mild rise from baseline but not meeting criteria for clinical TLS, which requires creatinine $\\geq 1.5\\times$ the upper limit of normal for age), preserved though suboptimal urine output at $1\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg/hr}$, and no electrocardiogram changes or seizures; thus immediate dialysis is not indicated.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- A. Laboratory TLS is present; the proposed management includes aggressive isotonic fluids targeting urine output $\\geq 3\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg/hr}$, immediate rasburicase, discontinuation of allopurinol, frequent laboratory monitoring with attention to uric acid sample handling, avoidance of alkalinization, and on-demand treatment of electrolyte abnormalities. This aligns with first principles and evidence-based TLS management. Verdict: Correct.\n\n- B. Claims laboratory TLS is not present and recommends only continuing current measures, $24$-hour labs, and urine alkalinization. This is incorrect because at least two laboratory criteria (uric acid and phosphate) are met, and urine alkalinization is discouraged. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- C. Correctly identifies laboratory TLS but recommends sodium bicarbonate alkalinization and high-dose allopurinol while avoiding rasburicase due to unknown G6PD status. This is not appropriate: alkalinization is generally avoided; rasburicase is the preferred agent for established hyperuricemia; while G6PD deficiency is a contraindication, unknown status should prompt rapid testing rather than preclude rasburicase in an urgent setting, and allopurinol does not reduce existing uric acid. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- D. States laboratory and clinical TLS are present and calls for urgent dialysis with cessation of cytoreduction. Clinical TLS requires laboratory TLS plus one or more clinical complications such as seizure, clinically significant arrhythmia/sudden death, or renal dysfunction (creatinine $\\geq 1.5\\times$ upper limit of normal). The child has none of these; immediate dialysis and stopping therapy are not indicated.

It presents a scientifically grounded and clinically realistic scenario of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) in a pediatric patient. The provided data, including laboratory values ($K^{+} = 6.4$ $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$, $P = 7.5$ $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, $Ca = 7.0$ $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$), clinical findings (peaked T waves on ECG), and patient parameters (weight = $20$ $\\mathrm{kg}$), are self-contained and consistent. The problem is well-posed, objective, and asks for a solution based on established principles of pediatric critical care, followed by a specific, solvable calculation.\n\nThe intervention sequence is prioritized based on the immediacy of life threats. The most acute risk is sudden cardiac death from hyperkalemia-induced arrhythmia.\n\n**1. Immediate Cardiac Membrane Stabilization**\nThe primary, immediate intervention must address the cardiac effects of hyperkalemia, as evidenced by the serum potassium level of $K^{+} = 6.4$ $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$ and the new peaked T waves on the ECG. These changes signify an increased risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.\n-   **Intervention:** Intravenous administration of a calcium salt to stabilize the cardiac myocyte membrane potential, which antagonizes the arrhythmogenic effects of hyperkalemia. This does not lower the serum potassium level but provides immediate cardioprotection.\n-   **Agent Selection:** Calcium gluconate $10\\%$ is the preferred agent in this scenario. While calcium chloride provides more elemental calcium per volume, it carries a higher risk of severe tissue necrosis if extravasation occurs, making calcium gluconate a safer choice for administration, especially via a peripheral IV line in a hemodynamically stable child.\n-   **Dose:** The standard pediatric dose for emergent hyperkalemia is $50$ $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ to $100$ $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ of $10\\%$ calcium gluconate. A dose of $100$ $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ is appropriate. For a child weighing $20$ $\\mathrm{kg}$, the dose is:\n    $$100 \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg}} \\times 20 \\ \\mathrm{kg} = 2000 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n    This corresponds to $20$ $\\mathrm{mL}$ of a $10\\%$ calcium gluconate solution ($100$ $\\mathrm{mg/mL}$). It must be administered slowly, typically over $5$ to $10$ minutes, with continuous cardiac monitoring to observe for resolution of ECG changes and potential bradycardia.\n-   **Consideration for Hyperphosphatemia:** The patient has a phosphate level of $P = 7.5$ $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. The product of total calcium and phosphate is $Ca \\times P = 7.0 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL} \\times 7.5 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL} = 52.5 \\ (\\mathrm{mg/dL})^2$. An elevated calcium-phosphate product (typically $> 55$) increases the risk of metastatic calcification in soft tissues, including the kidneys, which can worsen renal function. In non-emergent situations, calcium administration is typically avoided in hyperphosphatemic patients. However, in the setting of life-threatening cardiotoxicity from hyperkalemia, the immediate need for cardiac membrane stabilization outweighs the risk of precipitation.\n\n**2. Intracellular Shifting of Potassium**\nFollowing membrane stabilization, the next priority is to acutely lower the serum potassium level by shifting it from the extracellular fluid into the intracellular space.\n-   **Intervention:** Administer a combination of regular insulin and dextrose intravenously. Insulin activates the Na-K-ATPase pump on cell membranes, driving potassium into cells.\n-   **Dose:**\n    -   **Insulin:** A standard dose of regular insulin is $0.1$ $\\mathrm{units/kg}$. For a $20$ $\\mathrm{kg}$ child, the dose is $0.1 \\ \\mathrm{units/kg} \\times 20 \\ \\mathrm{kg} = 2$ units, given as an IV bolus.\n    -   **Dextrose:** To prevent hypoglycemia from the insulin administration, a dextrose bolus is required. A standard dose is $0.5$ $\\mathrm{g/kg}$. This is followed by a continuous infusion to mitigate the ongoing risk of hypoglycemia.\n        -   **Bolus:** Using the specified $10\\%$ dextrose in water (D$10$W) solution, which contains $10$ $\\mathrm{g}$ of dextrose per $100$ $\\mathrm{mL}$ (or $0.1$ $\\mathrm{g/mL}$). The required mass of dextrose for the bolus is $0.5 \\ \\mathrm{g/kg} \\times 20 \\ \\mathrm{kg} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{g}$. The volume of D$10$W is $10 \\ \\mathrm{g} / 0.1 \\ \\mathrm{g/mL} = 100 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$.\n        -   **Continuous Infusion:** As specified, a continuous infusion of D$10$W is run at a rate of $2$ $\\mathrm{mL/kg/hr}$. For a $20$ $\\mathrm{kg}$ child, this rate is $2 \\ \\mathrm{mL/kg/hr} \\times 20 \\ \\mathrm{kg} = 40 \\ \\mathrm{mL/hr}$. This helps maintain euglycemia as the administered insulin continues to act.\n\n**3. Ongoing Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome**\nThe underlying drivers of TLS must be managed to prevent further electrolyte derangements and end-organ damage.\n-   **Aggressive Hydration:** This is the cornerstone of TLS management. Administering intravenous isotonic fluids (e.g., $0.9\\%$ sodium chloride) at a high rate, such as $2$ to $3$ times the maintenance fluid rate, promotes high urine output. This enhances the renal clearance of potassium, phosphate, and uric acid. The child's current urine output of $1.5$ $\\mathrm{mL/kg/hr}$ is adequate but must be maintained or increased with this strategy.\n-   **Uric Acid Control:** Hyperuricemia is a key feature of TLS that can lead to acute kidney injury via crystal nephropathy. Given the severity of the electrolyte abnormalities, this patient is at high risk for worsening TLS. The most effective intervention is the administration of rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme that rapidly catabolizes existing uric acid into the more soluble allantoin. This is superior to allopurinol in established, high-risk TLS, as allopurinol only prevents the formation of new uric acid.\n\n**Calculation of Total Dextrose Delivered in the First 60 Minutes**\nThe total amount of dextrose is the sum of the dextrose from the initial bolus and the dextrose from the continuous infusion over the first hour ($60$ minutes).\n\nLet $W$ be the child's weight, $W = 20 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\nThe concentration of the D$10$W solution, $C_{D10W}$, is $10 \\ \\mathrm{g}$ per $100 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$, or $0.1 \\ \\mathrm{g/mL}$.\n\n1.  **Dextrose from the Bolus ($m_{bolus}$):**\n    The bolus dose is $0.5 \\ \\mathrm{g}$ of dextrose per $\\mathrm{kg}$ of body weight.\n    $$m_{bolus} = 0.5 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{kg}} \\times W = 0.5 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{kg}} \\times 20 \\ \\mathrm{kg} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{g}$$\n\n2.  **Dextrose from the Continuous Infusion ($m_{infusion}$):**\n    The infusion is run at a rate $R = 2 \\ \\mathrm{mL/kg/hr}$.\n    The total infusion rate for the child is $R_{total} = R \\times W = 2 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{hr}} \\times 20 \\ \\mathrm{kg} = 40 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{hr}}$.\n    The infusion runs for a duration $t = 60 \\ \\mathrm{min} = 1 \\ \\mathrm{hr}$.\n    The total volume infused in this period is $V_{infusion} = R_{total} \\times t = 40 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{hr}} \\times 1 \\ \\mathrm{hr} = 40 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$.\n    The mass of dextrose from this volume is:\n    $$m_{infusion} = V_{infusion} \\times C_{D10W} = 40 \\ \\mathrm{mL} \\times 0.1 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{mL}} = 4 \\ \\mathrm{g}$$\n\n3.  **Total Dextrose ($m_{total}$):**\n    The total mass of dextrose delivered is the sum of the bolus and infusion masses.\n    $$m_{total} = m_{bolus} + m_{infusion} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{g} + 4 \\ \\mathrm{g} = 14 \\ \\mathrm{g}$$\nNo intermediate rounding was performed, so the final result is exact.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{14}\n$$", "id": "5177973"}]}
