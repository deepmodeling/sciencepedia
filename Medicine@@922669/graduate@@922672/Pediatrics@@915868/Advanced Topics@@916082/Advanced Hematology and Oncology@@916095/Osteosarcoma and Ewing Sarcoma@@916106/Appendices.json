It is scientifically grounded in the principles of orthopedic oncology, well-posed with sufficient data, and objective in its language. We may proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the total length of a surgical resection for a bone tumor with a skip lesion. Let us define a one-dimensional coordinate system along the longitudinal axis of the femur to model the geometry of the resection. We can set the coordinate of the most proximal point of the primary lesion to be $x = 0$.\n\nThe givens are:\n- The length of the primary intramedullary lesion, $L_{1} = 8.4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n- The length of the distal skip lesion, $L_{2} = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n- The length of the clear bone segment between the primary and skip lesions, $d = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n- The required oncologic margin of normal bone, $m = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nThe primary lesion occupies the spatial interval from $x = 0$ to $x = L_{1}$.\nThe proximal extent of the primary lesion is at $x_{p,prox} = 0$.\nThe distal extent of the primary lesion is at $x_{p,dist} = L_{1} = 8.4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nThe skip lesion is located distally to the primary lesion, separated by a gap of length $d$. Therefore, the proximal extent of the skip lesion is at a coordinate $d$ distal to the distal end of the primary lesion.\nThe proximal extent of the skip lesion is at $x_{s,prox} = x_{p,dist} + d = L_{1} + d$.\nThe skip lesion has a length of $L_{2}$, so its distal extent is at $x_{s,dist} = x_{s,prox} + L_{2} = (L_{1} + d) + L_{2}$.\n\nTo plan the en bloc resection, we must first identify the total span of all tumorous tissue. This is the continuous segment of bone stretching from the most proximal point of any disease to the most distal point of any disease.\nThe most proximal extent of any disease is the proximal extent of the primary lesion: $x_{disease,prox} = x_{p,prox} = 0$.\nThe most distal extent of any disease is the distal extent of the skip lesion: $x_{disease,dist} = x_{s,dist} = L_{1} + d + L_{2}$.\n\nThe total length of the bone segment containing all foci of disease, which we will denote as $L_{disease}$, is the difference between these two coordinates:\n$$L_{disease} = x_{disease,dist} - x_{disease,prox} = (L_{1} + d + L_{2}) - 0 = L_{1} + d + L_{2}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into this expression:\n$$L_{disease} = 8.4\\,\\mathrm{cm} + 3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm} + 1.6\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 13.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\n\nThe surgical plan requires a uniform oncologic margin of $m = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ of normal bone both proximally and distally to the entire disease-containing region. This means we must resect an additional length $m$ of bone proximal to the most proximal point of disease, and an additional length $m$ of bone distal to the most distal point of disease.\n\nThe total length of the resection, $L_{resection}$, is therefore the length of the disease-containing segment plus the two margins:\n$$L_{resection} = m + L_{disease} + m = L_{disease} + 2m$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $L_{disease}$:\n$$L_{resection} = (L_{1} + d + L_{2}) + 2m$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for all variables:\n$$L_{resection} = (8.4\\,\\mathrm{cm} + 3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm} + 1.6\\,\\mathrm{cm}) + 2(2.0\\,\\mathrm{cm})$$\n$$L_{resection} = 13.0\\,\\mathrm{cm} + 4.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\n$$L_{resection} = 17.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in centimeters and rounded to four significant figures.

The use of high-dose methotrexate for osteosarcoma, the necessity of leucovorin rescue, and the monitoring of renal function via eGFR are standard clinical practices. The bedside Schwartz equation is a validated and widely used method for estimating GFR in pediatric patients. The pharmacokinetic principles, such as $AUC = D/\\mathrm{CL}$ and the dependence of MTX clearance on renal function, are fundamental and scientifically correct.

The logical steps are: calculate patient eGFR, relate eGFR to MTX clearance and exposure (AUC), and then use this exposure to adjust the leucovorin dose.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and self-contained. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe primary goal is to determine the adjusted starting dose of leucovorin, which we will denote as $D_L$. The adjustment is based on the patient's predicted methotrexate exposure ($AUC_{\\mathrm{patient}}$) relative to a reference exposure ($AUC_{\\mathrm{ref}}$).\n\nFirst, we must calculate the patient's estimated glomerular filtration rate, $G_{\\mathrm{patient}}$, using the bedside Schwartz equation:\n$$ G = k \\times \\frac{\\text{Height}}{\\mathrm{SCr}} $$\nwhere Height is in cm and serum creatinine, $\\mathrm{SCr}$, is in mg/dL. The resulting GFR, $G$, is in units of mL/min per $1.73$ m$^2$.\nThe given values are $k=0.413$, Height $= 158$ cm, and $\\mathrm{SCr} = 1.18$ mg/dL.\n$$ G_{\\mathrm{patient}} = 0.413 \\times \\frac{158}{1.18} $$\n\nNext, we establish the relationship between the area under the concentration-time curve ($AUC$), drug clearance ($\\mathrm{CL}$), and eGFR ($G$). We are given the following relationships:\n1. $AUC = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{MTX}}}{\\mathrm{CL}}$, where $D_{\\mathrm{MTX}}$ is the administered dose of methotrexate.\n2. $\\mathrm{CL} \\propto G$, which can be written as $\\mathrm{CL} = c \\cdot G$ for some constant of proportionality $c$.\n\nSubstituting the second relationship into the first gives:\n$$ AUC = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{MTX}}}{c \\cdot G} $$\nThis shows that for a fixed drug dose $D_{\\mathrm{MTX}}$, the drug exposure $AUC$ is inversely proportional to the eGFR, $G$.\n$$ AUC \\propto \\frac{1}{G} $$\n\nThe leucovorin starting dose, $D_L$, is to be scaled in direct proportion to the ratio of the patient's AUC to a reference AUC. The baseline dose is $D_0 = 15$ mg/m$^2$, corresponding to the reference case.\n$$ D_L = D_0 \\times \\frac{AUC_{\\mathrm{patient}}}{AUC_{\\mathrm{ref}}} $$\nUsing the inverse proportionality between AUC and GFR, we can express the AUC ratio in terms of GFRs:\n$$ \\frac{AUC_{\\mathrm{patient}}}{AUC_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{MTX}} / (c \\cdot G_{\\mathrm{patient}})}{D_{\\mathrm{MTX}} / (c \\cdot G_{\\mathrm{ref}})} = \\frac{G_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{G_{\\mathrm{patient}}} $$\nThe MTX dose $D_{\\mathrm{MTX}}$ and the proportionality constant $c$ cancel out. This is expected, as the dose adjustment is based on the patient's physiology (renal function) relative to a reference.\n\nNow, we can write the final expression for the adjusted leucovorin dose:\n$$ D_L = D_0 \\times \\frac{G_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{G_{\\mathrm{patient}}} $$\nWe have all the necessary values:\n- $D_0 = 15$ mg/m$^2$\n- $G_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 90$ mL/min per $1.73$ m$^2$\n- $G_{\\mathrm{patient}} = 0.413 \\times \\frac{158}{1.18}$ mL/min per $1.73$ m$^2$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $D_L$:\n$$ D_L = 15 \\times \\frac{90}{0.413 \\times \\frac{158}{1.18}} $$\nWe can simplify this expression:\n$$ D_L = 15 \\times \\frac{90 \\times 1.18}{0.413 \\times 158} = 15 \\times \\frac{106.2}{65.254} $$\nCalculating the value:\n$$ D_L \\approx 15 \\times 1.62747... \\approx 24.4121 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ D_L \\approx 24.4 $$\nThe units are mg/m$^2$. The patient's lower eGFR ($G_{\\mathrm{patient}} \\approx 55.3$ mL/min per $1.73$ m$^2$) compared to the reference ($G_{\\mathrm{ref}}=90$) leads to reduced methotrexate clearance, higher drug exposure (AUC), and thus requires a higher leucovorin rescue dose.
