It utilizes the real-world, validated, and widely accepted ISTH scoring system for diagnosing overt DIC. The clinical scenario (septic shock as a precipitant for DIC) and the pattern of laboratory abnormalities are classic and medically accurate.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides specific laboratory values and directs the use of a standard, unambiguous scoring algorithm (ISTH). The components of the ISTH score are well-defined, and the diagnostic threshold is a fixed part of the framework. Therefore, a unique and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is objective, relying on quantitative data and standardized qualitative descriptors (\"strongly elevated\") that have direct correspondences within the ISTH framework. It is free from subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a direct application of a standard clinical diagnostic algorithm. A solution will now be provided.\n\nThe task is to calculate the overt DIC score using the ISTH framework based on the provided laboratory data. The total score is the sum of points from four domains: platelet count, fibrin-related markers (FRM), prothrombin time (PT) prolongation, and fibrinogen level.\n\nThe ISTH scoring system is as follows:\n\n1.  **Platelet Count**:\n    - $ > 100\\,000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$: $0$ points\n    - $50\\,000 - 100\\,000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$: $1$ point\n    - $  50\\,000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$: $2$ points\n\n2.  **Elevated Fibrin-Related Markers (FRM)**:\n    - No increase: $0$ points\n    - Moderate increase: $2$ points\n    - Strong increase: $3$ points\n\n3.  **Prolonged Prothrombin Time (PT)**:\n    - $  3\\,\\mathrm{s}$ prolongation: $0$ points\n    - $3 - 6\\,\\mathrm{s}$ prolongation: $1$ point\n    - $ > 6\\,\\mathrm{s}$ prolongation: $2$ points\n\n4.  **Fibrinogen Level**:\n    - $ > 1.0\\,\\mathrm{g/L}$: $0$ points\n    - $  1.0\\,\\mathrm{g/L}$: $1$ point\n\nWe will now apply the given data to this scoring system.\n\n- **Platelet Count Score**: The patient's platelet count is $60\\,000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. This value falls within the range of $50\\,000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ to $100\\,000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. Therefore, the score for this domain is $1$.\n\n- **FRM Score**: The FRM are described as \"strongly elevated\". This corresponds to a \"Strong increase\" in the scoring system. Therefore, the score for this domain is $3$.\n\n- **PT Prolongation Score**: The PT is prolonged by $5\\,\\mathrm{s}$. This value falls within the range of $3\\,\\mathrm{s}$ to $6\\,\\mathrm{s}$. Therefore, the score for this domain is $1$.\n\n- **Fibrinogen Level Score**: The patient's fibrinogen level is $120\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. As per the problem's instruction, this must be converted to $\\mathrm{g/L}$. The conversion is as follows:\n$$ 120\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{dL}} = 120\\,\\frac{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{g}}{10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 120 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{L}} = 1.2\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{L}} $$\nThe fibrinogen level is $1.2\\,\\mathrm{g/L}$. This value is greater than $1.0\\,\\mathrm{g/L}$. Therefore, the score for this domain is $0$.\n\nNow, we sum the scores from each domain to obtain the total overt DIC score:\n$$ \\text{Total Score} = (\\text{Platelet Score}) + (\\text{FRM Score}) + (\\text{PT Score}) + (\\text{Fibrinogen Score}) $$\n$$ \\text{Total Score} = 1 + 3 + 1 + 0 = 5 $$\nThe total ISTH overt DIC score is $5$.\n\nFinally, we must determine if this score meets the criteria for overt DIC. The ISTH framework specifies that a total score of $5$ or greater is compatible with overt DIC. Since the calculated score is $5$, the condition $5 \\ge 5$ is met.\nTherefore, the criteria for overt DIC are satisfied.\n\nThe problem requires reporting an indicator variable $\\delta$, where $\\delta=1$ if the criteria are met and $\\delta=0$ otherwise. Since the criteria are met, $\\delta=1$.\n\nThe final result is a two-entry row matrix containing the total score and the indicator variable $\\delta$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n5  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4830304"}, {"introduction": "Once DIC is identified, managing its life-threatening bleeding manifestations becomes the priority, with the correction of severe hypofibrinogenemia being a cornerstone of therapy.

Cryoprecipitate Dosing**\n\nThe problem specifies a conservative planning approach for cryoprecipitate. This means we must assume the least effective case for the increase in fibrinogen concentration per unit of cryoprecipitate. The given range is $10$–$15 \\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ per unit. The least effective case is an increase of $E_{cryo,min} = 10 \\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ per unit.\n\nLet $N_{cryo}$ be the number of cryoprecipitate units, which must be an integer. The total concentration increase achieved by $N_{cryo}$ units under the conservative assumption is $N_{cryo} \\times E_{cryo,min}$. To meet the clinical objective, this increase must be greater than or equal to the required increment $\\Delta C$.\n\n$$\nN_{cryo} \\times E_{cryo,min} \\ge \\Delta C\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values for $E_{cryo,min}$ and $\\Delta C$:\n\n$$\nN_{cryo} \\times 10 \\,\\mathrm{mg/dL} \\ge 70 \\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}\n$$\n\nSolving for $N_{cryo}$:\n\n$$\nN_{cryo} \\ge \\frac{70}{10}\n$$\n\n$$\nN_{cryo} \\ge 7\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest integer number of units that is sufficient. The smallest integer value of $N_{cryo}$ that satisfies this inequality is $7$.\n\n**3. Fibrinogen Concentrate Dosing**\n\nFor the fibrinogen concentrate, the recommended dosing range is from $D_{lower} = 30 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ to $D_{upper} = 50 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$. The problem instructs us to use the arithmetic mean of this range as a fair comparator dose, which we denote as $D_{mean}$.\n\n$$\nD_{mean} = \\frac{D_{lower} + D_{upper}}{2}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given range boundaries:\n\n$$\nD_{mean} = \\frac{30 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg} + 50 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}}{2} = \\frac{80 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}}{2} = 40 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}\n$$\n\nThe total dose, $D_{total}$, is calculated by multiplying this mean dose rate by the child's mass, $M = 20 \\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n\n$$\nD_{total} = D_{mean} \\times M\n$$\n\nSubstituting the values for $D_{mean}$ and $M$:\n\n$$\nD_{total} = 40 \\,\\mathrm{mg/kg} \\times 20 \\,\\mathrm{kg} = 800 \\,\\mathrm{mg}\n$$\n\nThe total dose of fibrinogen concentrate is $800$ milligrams.\n\n**4.

The problem is self-contained and logically consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a computation of the total FFP volume for a pediatric patient with sepsis-induced DIC, framed within a discussion of the relevant pathophysiology and physiological principles of fluid therapy.\n\nFirst, we address the underlying pathophysiology. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a complex systemic thrombohemorrhagic disorder. In the context of sepsis, massive activation of inflammatory pathways triggers a global activation of the coagulation system. This leads to the widespread formation of microthrombi in the microcirculation, which can cause ischemic end-organ damage. Concurrently, this uncontrolled coagulation consumes platelets and coagulation factors (such as fibrinogen, Factor V, and Factor VIII) at a rate that outpaces synthesis. This \"consumptive coagulopathy\" depletes the elements necessary for physiological hemostasis, leading to a paradoxical bleeding tendency, as observed in the patient's mucosal bleeding.\n\nThe therapeutic goal of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) administration in this specific context is not primarily volume expansion but the replenishment of these consumed coagulation factors. FFP contains all the plasma proteins and coagulation factors present in whole blood and serves to restore the patient's hemostatic potential.\n\nThe calculation of the required FFP volume is based on the patient's body mass and the prescribed weight-based dose.\nLet $m$ be the mass of the toddler and $D$ be the prescribed dose of FFP per unit mass.\nGiven values are:\n- Mass, $m = 12\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Dose, $D = 15\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$\n\nThe total volume of FFP, $V_{FFP}$, to be administered is the product of the mass and the dose:\n$$V_{FFP} = m \\times D$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$V_{FFP} = 12\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 15\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{kg}} = 180\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nNow, we consider the physiological implications of this infusion. The toddler's estimated total circulating blood volume, $V_{blood}$, can be calculated using the provided approximation of $v_{blood} = 80\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$.\n$$V_{blood} = m \\times v_{blood} = 12\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 80\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{kg}} = 960\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nThe administered FFP volume of $180\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ represents a significant fraction of the total blood volume (approximately $180/960 \\approx 18.75\\%$). This volume load has important consequences.\n\nFFP is a colloid solution. The proteins it contains, primarily albumin, exert a colloid oncotic pressure (COP). When infused into the vascular space, FFP increases the intravascular COP. According to the Starling principle, which governs transcapillary fluid exchange, this increase in COP helps to draw fluid from the interstitial space into the capillaries and retain fluid within the vasculature, thus expanding the effective circulating volume.\n\nHowever, in sepsis, systemic inflammation leads to endothelial injury and increased capillary permeability, a condition known as \"capillary leak syndrome.\" This compromises the integrity of the vascular barrier. As a result, not only water but also larger molecules like albumin can extravasate into the interstitial space. The problem states that due to this phenomenon, only a fraction, $\\eta = 70\\%$, of the infused plasma volume remains intravascular. The effective intravascular volume expansion, $\\Delta V_{IV}$, in the first hour would therefore be:\n$$\\Delta V_{IV} = \\eta \\times V_{FFP} = 0.70 \\times 180\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 126\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nThe remaining $30\\%$, or $54\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, leaks into the interstitial space, contributing to tissue edema.\n\nThis leads to the critical trade-off faced by the clinician. The benefit is the urgent replenishment of coagulation factors to control life-threatening hemorrhage. The risk is iatrogenic volume overload. The infused volume increases the intravascular hydrostatic pressure. In a patient with septic lung injury (often progressing to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, ARDS), this increased hydrostatic pressure, combined with already leaky pulmonary capillaries, can worsen the transudation of fluid into the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli, potentially precipitating or exacerbating pulmonary edema and respiratory failure. While the capillary leak mitigates the degree of immediate intravascular volume expansion, it worsens the systemic edema. Therefore, the infusion must be administered cautiously, typically over $1$ to $4$ hours, with careful monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic and respiratory status.\n\nThe core question, however, is a direct calculation of the total volume to be administered as per the prescription, which is independent of the subsequent physiological distribution.\n\nThe total volume is computed as:\n$$V_{FFP} = 12\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 15\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$$\n$$V_{FFP} = 180\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{180}$$", "id": "5136061"}]}
