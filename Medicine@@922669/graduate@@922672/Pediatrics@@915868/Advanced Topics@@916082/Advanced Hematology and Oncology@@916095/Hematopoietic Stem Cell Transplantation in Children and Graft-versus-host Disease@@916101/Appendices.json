For skin involvement, the staging is set by the fraction of body surface area involved with a maculopapular rash: stage $1$ if less than $0.25$, stage $2$ if from $0.25$ to $0.50$, stage $3$ if greater than $0.50$, and stage $4$ if generalized erythroderma with bullae or desquamation.\n\n2. For liver involvement, the staging is set by total serum bilirubin concentration: stage $1$ for $2.0$ to $2.9$ mg/dL, stage $2$ for $3.0$ to $5.9$ mg/dL, stage $3$ for $6.0$ to $14.9$ mg/dL, and stage $4$ for greater than or equal to $15.0$ mg/dL.\n\n3. For gastrointestinal involvement in children, the staging is determined by stool volume normalized to body weight: stage $1$ for $10.0$ to $19.9$ mL/kg/day, stage $2$ for $20.0$ to $29.9$ mL/kg/day, stage $3$ for greater than or equal to $30.0$ mL/kg/day, and stage $4$ for severe abdominal pain, ileus, or grossly bloody stool.\n\nNext, compute each organ stage.\n\nSkin: The rash involves a fraction $0.40$ of the body surface area. According to the skin staging, $0.25 \\le 0.40 \\le 0.50$ places the skin at stage $2$. There are no bullae or desquamation, so stage $4$ is excluded, and $0.40$ is not greater than $0.50$, so stage $3$ is excluded. Therefore, skin stage $=$ $2$.\n\nLiver: The total serum bilirubin is $3.5$ mg/dL. According to the liver staging thresholds, $3.0 \\le 3.5 \\le 5.9$ mg/dL corresponds to liver stage $2$. Therefore, liver stage $=$ $2$.\n\nGastrointestinal: We must first normalize the stool volume to body weight. The measured stool volume is $V = 540$ mL/day and the weight is $w = 18.0$ kg. The normalized volume is\n$$\nV_{\\text{kg}} = \\frac{V}{w} = \\frac{540}{18.0} = 30.0 \\ \\text{mL/kg/day}.\n$$\nUsing the pediatric gastrointestinal staging, $V_{\\text{kg}} \\ge 30.0$ mL/kg/day corresponds to gut stage $3$, provided there is no severe abdominal pain, ileus, or grossly bloody stool (which are absent here). Therefore, gut stage $=$ $3$.\n\nNow map organ stages to the overall modified Glucksberg grade:\n\n- Grade $I$ requires isolated skin stage $1$ or $2$ without liver or gut involvement. This is not the case because there is liver and gut involvement.\n- Grade $II$ includes skin stage $3$ and/or liver stage $1$ and/or gut stage $1$. Our liver is stage $2$ and gut is stage $3$, so this does not apply.\n- Grade $III$ includes liver stage $2$ or stage $3$ and/or gut stage $2$ or stage $3$, with or without any skin involvement. Our findings include liver stage $2$ and gut stage $3$, both meeting criteria for grade $III$.\n- Grade $IV$ requires any stage $4$ involvement in skin, liver, or gut. None of the organs are stage $4$.\n\nThus, the overall acute GVHD grade is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "5150205"}, {"introduction": "The management of immunosuppressive agents like tacrolimus requires a careful balance to maintain efficacy while avoiding toxicity.

We can therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this problem is that of linear pharmacokinetics. The problem states to assume first-order, linear pharmacokinetics. This assumption implies that, at a steady state, the concentration of the drug at any given time point within the dosing interval is directly proportional to the rate of drug administration (i.e., the dose). This proportionality holds true as long as the patient's pharmacokinetic parameters—such as clearance ($CL$), volume of distribution ($V_d$), bioavailability ($F$), and the dosing interval ($\\tau$)—remain constant.\n\nLet $C_{ss}(t)$ be the drug concentration at time $t$ within a dosing interval at steady state. For an orally administered drug, the concentration profile is complex, but for any fixed time point $t_{trough}$ (the time of the trough concentration just before the next dose), the concentration $C_{ss,min}$ is a function of the dose. In linear pharmacokinetics, this relationship is a direct proportionality.\n\nWe can express this as:\n$$ C_{ss,min} \\propto \\text{Dose} $$\nwhere $\\text{Dose}$ is the amount administered per dosing interval.\n\nThis can be written as an equation:\n$$ C_{ss,min} = k_p \\cdot \\text{Dose} $$\nwhere $k_p$ is a constant of proportionality. This constant amalgamates all other factors influencing the concentration, including the drug's bioavailability ($F$), the patient's clearance ($CL$), the volume of distribution ($V_d$), the dosing interval ($\\tau$), and the drug's absorption and elimination rate constants. The problem's assumptions that these parameters are constant allows us to treat $k_p$ as a constant for this dose adjustment.\n\nLet us denote the current state with the subscript $1$ and the target state with the subscript $2$.\nCurrent state:\nDose per interval: $\\text{Dose}_1$\nMeasured steady-state trough concentration: $C_{ss,min,1}$\nThe relationship is: $C_{ss,min,1} = k_p \\cdot \\text{Dose}_1$.\n\nTarget state:\nNew dose per interval: $\\text{Dose}_2$\nTarget steady-state trough concentration: $C_{ss,min,2}$\nThe relationship is: $C_{ss,min,2} = k_p \\cdot \\text{Dose}_2$.\n\nTo find the relationship needed to adjust the dose, we can take the ratio of the target state equation to the current state equation:\n$$ \\frac{C_{ss,min,2}}{C_{ss,min,1}} = \\frac{k_p \\cdot \\text{Dose}_2}{k_p \\cdot \\text{Dose}_1} $$\nThe proportionality constant $k_p$ cancels out, yielding the dose-proportionality equation:\n$$ \\frac{C_{ss,min,2}}{C_{ss,min,1}} = \\frac{\\text{Dose}_2}{\\text{Dose}_1} $$\nThis is the expression needed to adjust the dose.
