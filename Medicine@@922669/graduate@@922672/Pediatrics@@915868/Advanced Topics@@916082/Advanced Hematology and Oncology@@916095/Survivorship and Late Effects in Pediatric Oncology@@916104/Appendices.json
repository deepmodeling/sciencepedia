The quantities SMR, ERR, and EAR are well-established metrics. The context of late mortality in childhood cancer survivors is a real and significant area of medical research. The data provided are plausible within this context.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. It provides all necessary data ($O$, $E$, and person-years) and explicit definitions for the quantities to be calculated (SMR, ERR, EAR). A unique and stable solution can be determined from the provided information.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It is free of subjective claims or opinions.\n- **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The setup is complete and self-consistent. There is no missing information required for the calculations, nor are there any contradictory constraints.\n- **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The provided data are numerically and contextually realistic for a long-term follow-up study of a cohort of cancer survivors. An observed number of deaths of $50$ versus an expected $12$ yields an SMR of approximately $4.17$, a value that is high but not implausible for such a high-risk group.\n- **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The problem is well-structured with unambiguous definitions and a clear objective. There is no circular reasoning.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $O$ be the observed number of deaths, $E$ be the expected number of deaths, and $PY$ be the total person-years of observation. From the problem statement, we have:\n- $O = 50$\n- $E = 12$\n- $PY = 100{,}000$ person-years\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of three quantities: the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR), the Excess Relative Risk (ERR), and the Excess Absolute Risk (EAR).\n\n**1. Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR)**\nThe SMR is defined as the ratio of observed to expected deaths.\n$$ \\mathrm{SMR} = \\frac{O}{E} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\mathrm{SMR} = \\frac{50}{12} = \\frac{25}{6} \\approx 4.1666... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\mathrm{SMR} \\approx 4.167 $$\n\n**2. Excess Relative Risk (ERR)**\nThe ERR is defined as the multiplicative excess over the baseline risk. The baseline risk corresponds to an SMR of $1$. The ERR is therefore the portion of the SMR that is greater than $1$.\n$$ \\mathrm{ERR} = \\mathrm{SMR} - 1 $$\nUsing the exact fraction for SMR to maintain precision before the final rounding:\n$$ \\mathrm{ERR} = \\frac{50}{12} - 1 = \\frac{50}{12} - \\frac{12}{12} = \\frac{50 - 12}{12} = \\frac{38}{12} = \\frac{19}{6} \\approx 3.1666... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\mathrm{ERR} \\approx 3.167 $$\n\n**3. Excess Absolute Risk (EAR)**\nThe EAR is defined as the difference between observed and expected deaths (the number of excess deaths), normalized by the total person-time. This result is then scaled to be expressed per $100{,}000$ person-years.\nFirst, we calculate the number of excess deaths:\n$$ \\text{Excess Deaths} = O - E = 50 - 12 = 38 $$\nNext, we calculate the rate of excess deaths per person-year:\n$$ \\text{Excess Death Rate} = \\frac{O - E}{PY} = \\frac{38}{100{,}000} \\text{ per person-year} $$\nThe problem requires the EAR to be expressed per $100{,}000$ person-years. To achieve this, we multiply the per-person-year rate by $100{,}000$.\n$$ \\mathrm{EAR}_{\\text{per } 100,000 \\text{ PY}} = \\left( \\frac{O - E}{PY} \\right) \\times 100{,}000 $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\mathrm{EAR} = \\left( \\frac{50 - 12}{100{,}000} \\right) \\times 100{,}000 = \\frac{38}{100{,}000} \\times 100{,}000 = 38 $$\nThe value is an exact integer, $38$. To present this value with four significant figures as requested, we write it as $38.00$.\n\nThe final ordered triple $(\\mathrm{SMR}, \\mathrm{ERR}, \\mathrm{EAR})$ with values rounded to four significant figures is $(4.167, 3.167, 38.00)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4.167 & 3.167 & 38.00\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5209003"}, {"introduction": "While cohort-level statistics provide a crucial overview, clinical care and research require us to understand risk at the individual level.
