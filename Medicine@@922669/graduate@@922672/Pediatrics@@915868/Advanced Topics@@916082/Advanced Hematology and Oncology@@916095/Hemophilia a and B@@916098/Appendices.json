In clinical practice, the dose of clotting factor concentrate is chosen to achieve a desired rise in plasma factor activity, expressed as a percentage of normal.

The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not based on false premises, and contains no contradictions or ambiguities. It is a formalizable problem in applied mathematics and pharmacology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the General Dosing Relationship\nLet $D$ be the total dose of clotting factor concentrate in International Units ($\\mathrm{IU}$).\nLet $W$ be the patient's body weight in kilograms ($\\mathrm{kg}$).\nLet $\\Delta A$ be the desired rise in plasma factor activity, expressed as a percentage of normal ($\\%$).\nLet $d$ be the dose administered per unit of body weight, in $\\mathrm{IU/kg}$. By definition, $d = \\frac{D}{W}$.\n\nThe problem states that the incremental recovery is linear. This means that the rise in plasma activity, $\\Delta A$, is directly proportional to the dose per unit weight, $d$. We can write this as:\n$\\Delta A = R \\times d$\nwhere $R$ is the incremental recovery constant, with units of $\\frac{\\%}{\\mathrm{IU/kg}}$.\n\nFrom the provided data:\nFor Factor VIII (FVIII): A dose of $d = 1\\ \\mathrm{IU/kg}$ results in $\\Delta A = 2\\%$.\nThus, the recovery constant for FVIII is $R_{VIII} = \\frac{2\\%}{1\\ \\mathrm{IU/kg}} = 2\\ \\frac{\\%}{\\mathrm{IU/kg}}$.\n\nFor Factor IX (FIX): A dose of $d = 1\\ \\mathrm{IU/kg}$ results in $\\Delta A = 1\\%$.\nThus, the recovery constant for FIX is $R_{IX} = \\frac{1\\%}{1\\ \\mathrm{IU/kg}} = 1\\ \\frac{\\%}{\\mathrm{IU/kg}}$.\n\nThe goal is to find a relationship for the total dose $D$ as a function of $W$ and $\\Delta A$. We substitute $d = \\frac{D}{W}$ into the linear relationship:\n$\\Delta A = R \\times \\left(\\frac{D}{W}\\right)$\n\nSolving for $D$:\n$D = \\frac{W \\times \\Delta A}{R}$\n\nIt is conventional to define a dosing constant, let's call it $k$, which is the reciprocal of the recovery constant $R$.\n$k = \\frac{1}{R}$\nThe units of this constant $k$ are $\\frac{\\mathrm{IU/kg}}{\\%}$. This constant represents the dose in $\\mathrm{IU/kg}$ required to achieve a $1\\%$ rise in activity.\nThe general dosing relationship can now be written as:\n$D = k \\times W \\times \\Delta A$\n\nThis equation gives the total dose $D$ as a function of the desired rise $\\Delta A$ and body weight $W$. The proportionality constant that connects the product of desired rise and body weight to the dose is $k$.\n\nThe values for this proportionality constant are:\nFor FVIII: $k_{VIII} = \\frac{1}{R_{VIII}} = \\frac{1}{2\\ \\frac{\\%}{\\mathrm{IU/kg}}} = 0.5\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{IU/kg}}{\\%}$.\nFor FIX: $k_{IX} = \\frac{1}{R_{IX}} = \\frac{1}{1\\ \\frac{\\%}{\\mathrm{IU/kg}}} = 1.0\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{IU/kg}}{\\%}$.\n\n### Application to Patients\nNow, we apply the derived relationship $D = k \\times W \\times \\Delta A$ to each patient.\n\n**Patient A (Hemophilia A, FVIII):**\n- Weight, $W_A = 65\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- Desired rise, $\\Delta A_A = 40\\%$\n- Dosing constant, $k_{VIII} = 0.5\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{IU/kg}}{\\%}$\n\nThe required dose for Patient A, $D_A$, is:\n$$D_A = k_{VIII} \\times W_A \\times \\Delta A_A$$\n$$D_A = 0.5 \\times 65 \\times 40$$\n$$D_A = 0.5 \\times 2600 = 1300\\ \\mathrm{IU}$$\n\n**Patient B (Hemophilia B, FIX):**\n- Weight, $W_B = 80\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- Desired rise, $\\Delta A_B = 50\\%$\n- Dosing constant, $k_{IX} = 1.0\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{IU/kg}}{\\%}$\n\nThe required dose for Patient B, $D_B$, is:\n$$D_B = k_{IX} \\times W_B \\times \\Delta A_B$$\n$$D_B = 1.0 \\times 80 \\times 50$$\n$$D_B = 4000\\ \\mathrm{IU}$$\n\n### Calculation of the Sum of Doses\nThe final step is to compute the sum of the two doses, $D_{total}$.\n$$D_{total} = D_A + D_B$$\n$$D_{total} = 1300 + 4000 = 5300\\ \\mathrm{IU}$$\n\nThe sum of the two doses required to treat Patient A and Patient B is $5300\\ \\mathrm{IU}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{5300} $$", "id": "4379808"}, {"introduction": "While factor replacement is the cornerstone of hemophilia care, the development of neutralizing antibodies, or inhibitors, presents a significant clinical challenge.

The clinical team needs to distinguish a time- and temperature-dependent Factor VIII inhibitor (alloantibody) from a Lupus Anticoagulant (an antiphospholipid antibody) using a mixing study. As the fundamental base, use the following well-tested facts and definitions: the intrinsic pathway of coagulation depends on serine proteases and cofactors including Factor VIII (FVIII) and Factor IX (FIX); aPTT prolongation reflects impaired intrinsic pathway function; in mixing studies, immediate correction after combining patient plasma with normal pooled plasma suggests a factor deficiency, while failure to correct suggests an inhibitor; time- and temperature-dependent inhibitors (e.g., FVIII inhibitors) may show initial correction that is lost after incubation at physiologic temperature; antiphospholipid antibodies (e.g., Lupus Anticoagulant) are phospholipid-dependent nonspecific inhibitors that typically show little time or temperature dependence and often fail to correct on mixing.\n\nYou design a mixing study by combining patient plasma with normal pooled plasma in a $1{:}1$ ratio, measure the mixed aPTT immediately at $0$ minutes, and again after incubation for $120$ minutes at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.

There are no contradictions.\n- **Clarity**: The terminology is precise and standard for the field. The question is unambiguous.\n\n**Verdict**: The problem is valid.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe goal is to interpret the provided mixing study results based on the fundamental principles given.\n1.  **Patient's Baseline aPTT**: The patient's aPTT of $85\\ \\mathrm{s}$ is significantly longer than the upper limit of the reference range ($35\\ \\mathrm{s}$). This is consistent with severe FVIII deficiency but the \"newly prolonged\" status raises suspicion for a superimposed inhibitor.\n2.  **Immediate Mix (t = 0)**: Patient plasma is mixed with an equal volume ($1{:}1$ ratio) of normal pooled plasma. NPP contains approximately $100\\%$ of all clotting factors. A $1{:}1$ mix provides approximately $50\\%$ of FVIII activity to the patient's plasma. An FVIII level of $50\\%$ is sufficient to produce a normal aPTT. The observed immediate mixed aPTT is $34\\ \\mathrm{s}$, which is within the laboratory's reference interval ($28 - 35\\ \\mathrm{s}$). This phenomenon is termed \"correction.\" This immediate correction rules out a potent, immediate-acting inhibitor but is characteristic of a simple factor deficiency or a time-dependent inhibitor.\n3.  **Incubated Mix (t = 120 min)**: The mixture is incubated at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ for $120$ minutes. The aPTT is re-measured and found to be $71\\ \\mathrm{s}$. This value is significantly prolonged, demonstrating a \"loss of correction.\" The aPTT has lengthened from $34\\ \\mathrm{s}$ back towards the patient's original prolonged time.\n4.  **Interpretation**: This pattern—initial correction followed by a subsequent loss of correction after time-and-temperature dependent incubation—is the hallmark of a specific inhibitor whose activity is not immediate. FVIII inhibitors are alloantibodies that bind and neutralize FVIII in a progressive, time- and temperature-dependent manner. The incubation at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ mimics physiologic conditions and allows the antibody time to inactivate the FVIII supplied by the NPP. In contrast, a Lupus Anticoagulant is an antiphospholipid antibody that interferes with the test reagents almost instantaneously. An LA would typically result in a failure to correct even in the immediate mix (e.g., the $t=0$ aPTT would remain prolonged, perhaps at $50-60\\ \\mathrm{s}$) and would not show significant further prolongation upon incubation.\nThe experimental data ($34\\ \\mathrm{s}$ at $t=0$, $71\\ \\mathrm{s}$ at $t=120$) precisely fits the pattern of a time- and temperature-dependent FVIII inhibitor.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Perform a $1{:}1$ patient:normal plasma mixing study, measure aPTT at $0$ minutes and after $120$ minutes at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Immediate correction of the mixed aPTT into the reference interval with subsequent loss of correction after incubation indicates a time- and temperature-dependent Factor VIII inhibitor; failure to correct at both time points with no time dependence supports a Lupus Anticoagulant.**\nThis option accurately describes the standard procedure for a mixing study designed to detect a FVIII inhibitor. The interpretation for both a FVIII inhibitor (initial correction, subsequent loss of correction) and a Lupus Anticoagulant (immediate failure to correct, no time dependence) is correct and consistent with hematologic principles. This description perfectly matches the analysis derived from the problem's data.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Perform a $1{:}1$ patient:normal plasma mixing study, incubate the mix at room temperature ($\\approx 22^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$) for $30$ minutes only, and interpret progressive shortening after incubation as Lupus Anticoagulant and persistent non-correction as Factor VIII inhibitor.**\nThis option is incorrect for multiple reasons. First, incubation for FVIII inhibitors must be at physiologic temperature ($37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$), not room temperature ($22^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$), to ensure optimal antibody activity. The incubation time of $30$ minutes is also too short; $1-2$ hours are standard. Second, the interpretation is flawed. \"Progressive shortening\" is not a characteristic of LA. \"Persistent non-correction\" is characteristic of an immediate-acting inhibitor like LA, not a time-dependent FVIII inhibitor which shows initial correction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Perform a $4{:}1$ patient:normal plasma mixing study to increase inhibitor sensitivity; expect immediate non-correction with subsequent full correction after $120$ minutes at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to indicate a time-dependent Factor VIII inhibitor, whereas persistent non-correction at both time points indicates a Lupus Anticoagulant.**\nThis option's interpretation is factually incorrect. A time-dependent FVIII inhibitor causes an initial correction that is *lost* upon incubation, not an \"immediate non-correction with subsequent full correction.\" This describes a pattern that is not observed with FVIII inhibitors. While a $4{:}1$ mix can be used, the described interpretation of its results is fundamentally wrong.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Use a dilute Russell viper venom test (DRVVT) instead of a mixing study; immediate correction of the DRVVT with excess phospholipid defines Lupus Anticoagulant, whereas failure to correct after two-hour incubation defines Factor VIII inhibitor.**\nThis option proposes the wrong test for the primary goal. The DRVVT tests the common pathway by directly activating Factor X, thus bypassing the intrinsic pathway where FVIII acts. Therefore, the DRVVT is insensitive to FVIII levels or FVIII inhibitors. While the description of the DRVVT for diagnosing LA (prolongation corrected by excess phospholipid) is correct, its application to identify a FVIII inhibitor is scientifically invalid. A FVIII inhibitor would not cause a prolonged DRVVT.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nTherefore, option A is the only one that correctly outlines the procedure and interpretation for distinguishing a Factor VIII inhibitor from a Lupus Anticoagulant using a mixing study.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5151026"}, {"introduction": "After confirming the presence of a time-dependent inhibitor, the next step is to quantify its potency to guide management.

The task is to first derive a general expression for $I$ as a function of $r$, and then to calculate $I$ for a specific value of $r$.\n\nThe problem makes two key statements that form the basis of our mathematical model:\n$1$. By definition, one Bethesda unit ($I=1$) is the amount of inhibitor that reduces FVIII activity by $50\\%$. A reduction by $50\\%$ implies a residual activity of $100\\% - 50\\% = 50\\%$.

Substituting $I=1$ into the general form gives:\n$$r(1) = C \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^1 = \\frac{C}{2}$$\nSince we know $r(1) = 50$, we can solve for $C$:\n$$50 = \\frac{C}{2} \\implies C = 100$$\nThe constant $C = 100$ represents the residual activity at $I=0$ BU, which is $r(0) = 100\\%$.
