The clinical context, including the tumor types (medulloblastoma, pilocytic astrocytoma), location (posterior fossa), patient age ($6$ years), and imaging findings (DWI/ADC, mural nodule), is clinically and scientifically accurate. The provided probabilities, while hypothetical, are plausible in such a context. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for a single, specific quantity, the posterior probability $P(M \\mid F_{1} \\cap F_{2})$. All necessary information, including prior probabilities, conditional probabilities, and the crucial assumption of conditional independence, is provided. A unique solution exists.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and objective language. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The hypotheses $M$ and $A$ form a complete partition of the diagnostic space considered, as their prior probabilities sum to $1$ ($P(M) + P(A) = 0.6 + 0.4 = 1.0$). All probabilities are valid values between $0$ and $1$. There are no internal contradictions.\n5.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The scenario is realistic. Differential diagnosis based on probabilistic reasoning and imaging findings is standard practice in modern medicine. The assumption of conditional independence, while a simplification, is a common and often necessary modeling choice in Bayesian networks.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, complete, and consistent. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the posterior probability of the tumor being a medulloblastoma given the two imaging findings, $P(M \\mid F_{1} \\cap F_{2})$. We will use Bayes' theorem, which states that for a hypothesis $H$ and evidence $E$, the posterior probability is given by:\n$$P(H \\mid E) = \\frac{P(E \\mid H) P(H)}{P(E)}$$\nIn this problem, the hypothesis $H$ is the event $M$, and the evidence $E$ is the conjunction of the two findings, $F_{1} \\cap F_{2}$. Therefore, Bayes' theorem takes the form:\n$$P(M \\mid F_{1} \\cap F_{2}) = \\frac{P(F_{1} \\cap F_{2} \\mid M) P(M)}{P(F_{1} \\cap F_{2})}$$\nThe numerator and the denominator must be evaluated separately.\n\nFirst, we evaluate the numerator, $P(F_{1} \\cap F_{2} \\mid M) P(M)$. The problem states that the findings $F_{1}$ and $F_{2}$ are conditionally independent given the true diagnosis. This means:\n$$P(F_{1} \\cap F_{2} \\mid M) = P(F_{1} \\mid M) P(F_{2} \\mid M)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(F_{1} \\cap F_{2} \\mid M) = (0.9) \\times (0.7) = 0.63$$\nThe full numerator is then:\n$$P(F_{1} \\cap F_{2} \\mid M) P(M) = (0.63) \\times (0.6) = 0.378$$\nNext, we evaluate the denominator, $P(F_{1} \\cap F_{2})$, which is the total probability of observing both findings. The law of total probability allows us to express this by marginalizing over the possible diagnoses, which are $M$ and $A$. These events form a partition of the sample space.\n$$P(F_{1} \\cap F_{2}) = P(F_{1} \\cap F_{2} \\mid M) P(M) + P(F_{1} \\cap F_{2} \\mid A) P(A)$$\nThe first term in this sum is the numerator we have already calculated, $0.378$.\nFor the second term, we again use the conditional independence assumption, this time conditioned on event $A$:\n$$P(F_{1} \\cap F_{2} \\mid A) = P(F_{1} \\mid A) P(F_{2} \\mid A)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(F_{1} \\cap F_{2} \\mid A) = (0.15) \\times (0.35) = 0.0525$$\nSo, the second term of the total probability is:\n$$P(F_{1} \\cap F_{2} \\mid A) P(A) = (0.0525) \\times (0.4) = 0.021$$\nNow, we can calculate the total probability in the denominator:\n$$P(F_{1} \\cap F_{2}) = 0.378 + 0.021 = 0.399$$\nFinally, we can assemble the full expression for the posterior probability:\n$$P(M \\mid F_{1} \\cap F_{2}) = \\frac{P(F_{1} \\cap F_{2} \\mid M) P(M)}{P(F_{1} \\cap F_{2})} = \\frac{0.378}{0.399}$$\nThe derivation in symbolic form is:\n$$P(M \\mid F_{1} \\cap F_{2}) = \\frac{P(F_{1} \\mid M) P(F_{2} \\mid M) P(M)}{P(F_{1} \\mid M) P(F_{2} \\mid M) P(M) + P(F_{1} \\mid A) P(F_{2} \\mid A) P(A)}$$\nEvaluating this expression numerically:\n$$P(M \\mid F_{1} \\cap F_{2}) = \\frac{0.378}{0.399} \\approx 0.94736842...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9$, $4$, $7$, $3$. The fifth significant figure is $6$, which is $5$ or greater, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$P(M \\mid F_{1} \\cap F_{2}) \\approx 0.9474$$\nThis result indicates that after observing the two imaging findings, the probability that the tumor is a medulloblastoma has increased from the prior probability of $0.6$ to a posterior probability of approximately $0.9474$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9474}\n$$", "id": "5181920"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis is established, the next critical step is risk stratification, which guides the intensity of treatment.

The foundational clinical rule is as follows: patients are considered average-risk if there is no metastasis and the postoperative residual tumor area does not exceed a predefined threshold; patients are considered high-risk if either postoperative residual area exceeds the threshold or any metastatic disease is present. In medulloblastoma, the metastatic stage is defined by dissemination within the neuraxis: no metastasis is $M=0$, positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, cerebrospinal fluid) cytology without radiographic metastases is $M=1$, and more extensive radiographic dissemination corresponds to $M \\geq 2$.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to construct a function $C(A,M)$ that counts the number of high-risk criteria present for a patient with residual tumor area $A$ and metastatic stage $M$. The clinical rules provided allow for the formal identification of two distinct high-risk criteria.\n\nThe first criterion pertains to the residual tumor area. A patient is at high risk if the postoperative residual area exceeds the threshold of $1.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. We can express this condition mathematically as:\n$$ \\text{Criterion 1: } A > 1.5 $$\n\nThe second criterion pertains to the metastatic stage. A patient is at high risk if \"any metastatic disease is present.\" According to the provided definitions, $M=0$ signifies no metastasis, while $M=1$ (positive CSF cytology) and $M \\ge 2$ (radiographic dissemination) both represent a metastatic state. Therefore, this criterion is met if $M$ is any non-zero integer. Since $M$ is defined as a non-negative integer stage, this is equivalent to:\n$$ \\text{Criterion 2: } M \\ge 1 $$\n\nThe function $C(A,M)$ must count how many of these two criteria are satisfied. A minimal function that accomplishes this is the sum of two indicator functions, one for each criterion.\n\nLet $I_A(A)$ be the indicator function for the area criterion:\n$$ I_A(A) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } A > 1.5 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } A \\le 1.5 \\end{cases} $$\nLet $I_M(M)$ be the indicator function for the metastasis criterion:\n$$ I_M(M) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } M \\ge 1 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } M = 0 \\end{cases} $$\n\nThe classifier function $C(A,M)$ is the sum of these indicators:\n$$ C(A,M) = I_A(A) + I_M(M) $$\nThis construction directly quantifies the number of high-risk criteria present. It satisfies the required properties: $C(A,M)=0$ if and only if both indicators are $0$ (average-risk); $C(A,M)=1$ if and only if exactly one indicator is $1$; and $C(A,M)=2$ if and only if both indicators are $1$.\n\nWe now apply this function to the specific case presented: a child with a residual tumor area of $A=2.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ and a metastatic stage of $M=1$.\n\nWe evaluate the value of each indicator function for the given inputs, $A=2.0$ and $M=1$.\n\nFor the area criterion, we check if $A > 1.5$. Since $2.0 > 1.5$, the condition is met. Thus, the value of the first indicator is:\n$$ I_A(2.0) = 1 $$\n\nFor the metastasis criterion, we check if $M \\ge 1$. Since $M=1$, the condition is met. Thus, the value of the second indicator is:\n$$ I_M(1) = 1 $$\n\nThe final value of the classifier function $C(A,M)$ is the sum of these two indicator values:\n$$ C(2.0, 1) = I_A(2.0) + I_M(1) = 1 + 1 = 2 $$\nThis result signifies that the patient fulfills both criteria for high-risk classification.
