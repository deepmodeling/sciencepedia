The child’s current KD prescription is a $3:1$ ratio with daily energy intake $E$ held constant and protein grams $P$ set by requirement. The care team notes inadequate ketosis based on persistently low blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels and elects to intensify ketosis by increasing the ratio to $4:1$, while carefully monitoring for side effects (e.g., gastrointestinal intolerance, hypoglycemia, acidosis, hyperlipidemia). The management plan mandates that the total daily energy $E$ and daily protein grams $P$ remain constant during ratio titration, while carbohydrate grams $C$ are adjusted accordingly.\n\nFoundational facts:\n- The ketogenic ratio is defined as $r = \\frac{F}{P + C}$, where $F$ is daily fat grams, $P$ is daily protein grams, and $C$ is daily carbohydrate grams.\n- Energy density of macronutrients: fat provides $9$ kilocalories per gram, protein provides $4$ kilocalories per gram, and carbohydrate provides $4$ kilocalories per gram.\n- Therefore, the total daily energy $E$ satisfies $E = 9F + 4P + 4C$.\n\nClinical scenario for calculation:\n- The child weighs $20$ kilograms, with a protein requirement of $1.5$ grams per kilogram per day, so $P$ is fixed at $30$ grams per day.\n- The KD is prescribed at a total energy $E = 1400$ kilocalories per day.\n- The care team will increase the ratio stepwise across four equal steps in $r$ (i.e., $r = 3.00$, then $3.25$, $3.50$, $3.75$, and finally $4.00$), keeping $E$ and $P$ constant throughout and adjusting $C$ to match the specified $r$ at each step.\n\nTask:\nStarting from the definitions and energy densities above, derive the expression for daily fat grams $F$ as a function of the ratio $r$, total energy $E$, and protein grams $P$, under the constraints specified. Use that expression to compute the average per-step increase in daily fat grams required to move from $r = 3:1$ to $r = 4:1$ in four equal ratio steps, while maintaining $E = 1400$ kilocalories per day and $P = 30$ grams per day.\n\nExpress your final numerical answer as grams, and round your answer to four significant figures.

All necessary data and definitions are provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The clinical scenario is a standard application of nutritional biochemistry principles in the management of refractory epilepsy. Therefore, the problem is valid, and I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem requires two main tasks: first, to derive an expression for the daily fat grams, $F$, as a function of the ketogenic ratio, $r$, total daily energy, $E$, and daily protein grams, $P$. Second, to use this expression to calculate the average per-step increase in daily fat grams for a specified clinical scenario.\n\nThe two fundamental relationships provided are the definition of the ketogenic ratio, $r$, and the equation for total daily energy, $E$.\n\nThe ketogenic ratio is defined as:\n$$r = \\frac{F}{P + C} \\quad (\\text{Equation } 1)$$\nwhere $F$ represents grams of fat, $P$ represents grams of protein, and $C$ represents grams of carbohydrate.\n\nThe total daily energy intake is given by the sum of the energy provided by each macronutrient, based on their standard energy densities ($9$ kcal/g for fat, $4$ kcal/g for protein, and $4$ kcal/g for carbohydrate):\n$$E = 9F + 4P + 4C \\quad (\\text{Equation } 2)$$\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for $F$ in terms of $r$, $E$, and $P$. This requires eliminating the variable $C$ from the two equations. A key observation from Equation $2$ is that protein and carbohydrates have the same energy density ($4$ kcal/g). This allows us to factor out the coefficient $4$:\n$$E = 9F + 4(P + C) \\quad (\\text{Equation } 3)$$\n\nFrom Equation $1$, we can express the term $(P + C)$ in terms of $F$ and $r$:\n$$P + C = \\frac{F}{r} \\quad (\\text{Equation } 4)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $(P + C)$ from Equation $4$ into Equation $3$:\n$$E = 9F + 4\\left(\\frac{F}{r}\\right)$$\n\nThis equation now relates $E$, $F$, and $r$. It is notable that the protein term, $P$, has been eliminated from the equation. This cancellation is a direct consequence of protein and carbohydrate having identical energy densities, which is a foundational fact upon which the ketogenic ratio's clinical utility is partly based. Although the problem asks for $F$ as a function of $r$, $E$, and $P$, the derivation correctly shows that under these definitions, $F$ is independent of $P$ when $E$ is held constant.\n\nWe can now solve for $F$:\n$$E = F\\left(9 + \\frac{4}{r}\\right)$$\nTo isolate $F$, we first combine the terms in the parenthesis into a single fraction:\n$$E = F\\left(\\frac{9r + 4}{r}\\right)$$\nFinally, solving for $F$ yields the desired expression:\n$$F(r, E) = \\frac{Er}{9r + 4}$$\nThis is the general expression for daily fat grams as a function of the ketogenic ratio $r$ and total energy $E$, given the specified energy densities and the constraint of adjusting only carbohydrates to alter the ratio.\n\nThe second task is to compute the average per-step increase in daily fat grams as the ratio is changed from $r = 3$ to $r = 4$ in four equal steps. The specific values for this scenario are:\n- Total daily energy, $E = 1400$ kilocalories.\n- Daily protein, $P = 30$ grams (this value is a fixed condition but does not appear in the final formula for $F$).\n- Initial ratio, $r_{start} = 3.00$.\n- Final ratio, $r_{end} = 4.00$.\n- Number of steps, $N_{steps} = 4$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial daily fat grams, $F_{start}$, at $r = 3.00$:\n$$F_{start} = F(r=3, E=1400) = \\frac{1400 \\times 3}{9 \\times 3 + 4} = \\frac{4200}{27 + 4} = \\frac{4200}{31} \\text{ grams}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the final daily fat grams, $F_{end}$, at $r = 4.00$:\n$$F_{end} = F(r=4, E=1400) = \\frac{1400 \\times 4}{9 \\times 4 + 4} = \\frac{5600}{36 + 4} = \\frac{5600}{40} = 140 \\text{ grams}$$\n\nThe total increase in fat grams, $\\Delta F_{total}$, required to move from $r = 3.00$ to $r = 4.00$ is the difference between $F_{end}$ and $F_{start}$:\n$$\\Delta F_{total} = F_{end} - F_{start} = 140 - \\frac{4200}{31}$$\nTo compute this difference, we find a common denominator:\n$$\\Delta F_{total} = \\frac{140 \\times 31}{31} - \\frac{4200}{31} = \\frac{4340 - 4200}{31} = \\frac{140}{31} \\text{ grams}$$\n\nThe problem states this transition occurs over four equal steps. The average per-step increase in fat, $(\\Delta F)_{avg}$, is the total increase divided by the number of steps:\n$$(\\Delta F)_{avg} = \\frac{\\Delta F_{total}}{N_{steps}} = \\frac{140/31}{4} = \\frac{140}{31 \\times 4} = \\frac{35}{31} \\text{ grams}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures as requested:\n$$(\\Delta F)_{avg} = \\frac{35}{31} \\approx 1.129032258...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $1.129$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.129}$$", "id": "5100671"}, {"introduction": "Modern management of refractory epilepsy frequently involves polytherapy, demanding a sophisticated understanding of pharmacokinetic interactions.

Clobazam is primarily converted to its active metabolite N-desmethylclobazam by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), and N-desmethylclobazam is predominantly eliminated by cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19). Cannabidiol is a reversible competitive inhibitor of CYP2C19 and is itself metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, leading to bidirectional pharmacokinetic interaction: cannabidiol inhibits CYP2C19, raising N-desmethylclobazam exposure, while co-therapy with clobazam can alter cannabidiol biotransformation via shared pathways, leading to reciprocal changes in cannabidiol and its hydroxy-metabolites. \n\nAssume the following for N-desmethylclobazam at steady state: (i) its formation rate from clobazam is unchanged over the cannabidiol dose range considered, (ii) a fraction $f_m$ of its total elimination clearance is mediated by CYP2C19 and the remainder is not affected by cannabidiol, and (iii) cannabidiol inhibits CYP2C19 competitively with inhibition constant $K_i$.
