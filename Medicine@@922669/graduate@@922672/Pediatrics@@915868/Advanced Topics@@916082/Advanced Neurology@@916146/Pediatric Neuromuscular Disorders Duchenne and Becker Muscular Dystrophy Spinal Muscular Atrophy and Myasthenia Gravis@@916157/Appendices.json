We must first validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- A couple has a first child diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA).\n- SMA is caused by a homozygous deletion of Survival Motor Neuron $1$ ($\\mathrm{SMN1}$).\n- The disease is described as a fully penetrant, autosomal recessive lesion in this family.\n- The couple has no known consanguinity.\n- The carrier frequency for a single $\\mathrm{SMN1}$ deletion allele in the source population is $\\frac{1}{50}$.\n- The population is in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.\n- De novo mutations are negligible.\n- A second child of this couple is phenotypically unaffected at age $5$ years.\n- The goal is to compute the posterior probability that this unaffected sibling is a heterozygous carrier.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem describes a classic Mendelian inheritance scenario for a real genetic disorder, SMA. The principles of autosomal recessive inheritance, full penetrance, and conditional probability are standard tools in medical genetics. The carrier frequency of $\\frac{1}{50}$ is a realistic, established value for SMA in many populations.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary information to calculate a unique probability. The question is specific and unambiguous.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, factual terms without subjective or opinion-based content.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. The information about population carrier frequency and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is technically superfluous for determining the parents' genotypes, as their status is unequivocally established by their affected child, but its inclusion does not create a contradiction. It is a common feature in such problems to test the solver's ability to identify the most direct and certain information.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet `$A$` represent the normal, functional allele of the $\\mathrm{SMN1}$ gene, and let `$a$` represent the recessive deletion allele that causes SMA. Since the condition is autosomal recessive, the genotypes correspond to the following phenotypes:\n- `$AA$`: Homozygous dominant; phenotypically unaffected, non-carrier.\n- `$Aa$`: Heterozygous; phenotypically unaffected, carrier.\n- `$aa$`: Homozygous recessive; phenotypically affected with SMA.\n\nThe couple has a child diagnosed with SMA, which means this first child's genotype must be `$aa$`. To produce an offspring with genotype `$aa$`, the child must inherit one `$a$` allele from each parent. The problem implies the parents are unaffected, and this is a necessary condition for them to be part of a couple having children in a typical scenario. Therefore, since they each carry an `$a$` allele but are not affected themselves (i.e., they are not `$aa$`), both parents must have the heterozygous genotype `$Aa$`. The fact that they produced an affected child provides definitive information about their genotypes, making probabilistic calculations based on population frequency unnecessary to determine their carrier status.\n\nWe are interested in the genetic status of their second child. The cross between the two heterozygous parents (`$Aa \\times Aa$`) produces offspring with the following genotypic probabilities, according to Mendelian segregation:\n- Probability of `$AA$` (unaffected, non-carrier): $P(AA) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- Probability of `$Aa$` (unaffected, carrier): $P(Aa) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Probability of `$aa$` (affected with SMA): $P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThe sum of these probabilities is $P(AA) + P(Aa) + P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$.\n\nWe are given a critical piece of information: the second child is phenotypically unaffected. This condition eliminates the possibility of the child having the `$aa$` genotype. We must therefore calculate the conditional probability that the child is a carrier (`$Aa$`), given that they are unaffected.\n\nLet `$U$` be the event that the child is phenotypically unaffected. This corresponds to the child having either the `$AA$` or `$Aa$` genotype. The probability of this event is:\n$$ P(U) = P(AA \\cup Aa) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} $$\n\nLet `$C$` be the event that the child is a heterozygous carrier. This corresponds to the genotype `$Aa$`. The probability of this event is $P(C) = P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe seek the posterior probability that the sibling is a carrier given that they are unaffected, which is denoted as $P(C | U)$. Using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$ P(C|U) = \\frac{P(C \\cap U)}{P(U)} $$\n\nThe event `$C \\cap U$` is \"the child is a carrier AND is unaffected\". A carrier (`$Aa$`) is by definition unaffected. Thus, the event `$C \\cap U$` is identical to the event `$C$`.\nTherefore, $P(C \\cap U) = P(C) = P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting the probabilities into the conditional probability formula:\n$$ P(C|U) = \\frac{P(Aa)}{P(U)} = \\frac{P(Aa)}{P(AA) + P(Aa)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{4}} $$\n$$ P(C|U) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\n\nAlternatively, one can consider the reduced sample space of possible genotypes for an unaffected child. The possible genotypes are `$AA$` and `$Aa$`. The prior probabilities for these were in the ratio $P(AA) : P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{4} : \\frac{2}{4}$, which is a ratio of $1:2$. Within this new sample space of unaffected children, the probability of being a carrier (`$Aa$`) is the \"part\" over the \"whole\":\n$$ P(\\text{carrier } | \\text{ unaffected}) = \\frac{\\text{Probability of carrier}}{\\text{Sum of probabilities of unaffected outcomes}} = \\frac{2}{1+2} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nThe posterior probability that the unaffected sibling is a heterozygous carrier is $\\frac{2}{3}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$$", "id": "5189116"}, {"introduction": "Moving from inheritance patterns to molecular mechanisms, this practice explores the genetic foundation of modern therapeutics for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). You will engage with the \"reading frame rule,\" a critical concept that dictates whether a mutation in the dystrophin gene leads to the severe Duchenne or milder Becker phenotype. This problem challenges you to determine if an antisense oligonucleotide therapy can restore a functional protein by \"skipping\" an exon, a core skill in the era of personalized genetic medicine [@problem_id:5189105].", "problem": "A 7-year-old boy with progressive proximal muscle weakness, calf pseudohypertrophy, elevated serum creatine kinase, and a positive Gowers' sign undergoes genetic testing consistent with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The test shows a multi-exon deletion of dystrophin exons $48$–$52$, leaving exons $1$–$47$ and $53$–$79$ intact. You are asked to evaluate whether antisense oligonucleotide therapy directed to skip exon $53$ would be expected to restore an in-frame dystrophin transcript for this patient, using first principles of the genetic code and splicing.\n\nUse the following foundational facts and dataset:\n- By the Central Dogma of molecular biology (DNA $\\rightarrow$ RNA $\\rightarrow$ protein), messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) is translated in triplet codons of $3$ nucleotides. Maintenance of the open reading frame requires that the net number of coding nucleotides deleted or inserted be a multiple of $3$; otherwise, a frameshift occurs.\n- In pre-mRNA splicing, the concept of splice site phase denotes how a splice occurs relative to codon boundaries: phase $0$ means the splice occurs between codons, phase $1$ means it occurs after $1$ nucleotide of a codon, and phase $2$ means after $2$ nucleotides of a codon. When joining two exons, the upstream exon’s splice donor phase must match the downstream exon’s splice acceptor phase for the coding frame to remain continuous across the junction.\n\nAssume the relevant dystrophin exons in this region are fully coding and have the following empirically observed properties:\n- Coding nucleotide lengths (in nucleotides): exon $48$ is $123$, exon $49$ is $154$, exon $50$ is $120$, exon $51$ is $200$, exon $52$ is $142$, and exon $53$ is $188$.\n- Splice phases at the pertinent junctions: exon $47$ has a splice donor phase of $1$, exon $53$ has a splice acceptor phase of $2$, and exon $54$ has a splice acceptor phase of $1$.\n\nBased on these data and first principles, which statement is most accurate?\n\nA. Exon $53$ skipping would restore an in-frame transcript because the cumulative deleted coding length becomes divisible by $3$ and the splice donor/acceptor phases at the new junction ($47 \\rightarrow 54$) match.\n\nB. Exon $53$ skipping would not restore the frame; the cumulative deletion remains not divisible by $3$, and the donor/acceptor phases still mismatch.\n\nC. Exon $53$ skipping restores the frame only if exon $54$ is also skipped, since joining exon $47 \\rightarrow 55$ is required to match phases.\n\nD. Exon $53$ skipping would restore the frame mathematically, but the amino acid sequence downstream is guaranteed to be identical to wild type due to the triplet property.", "solution": "We begin from first principles.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Translation reads mRNA in codons of $3$ nucleotides. Therefore, any insertion or deletion in the coding sequence that changes the net coding length by an amount not divisible by $3$ will shift the reading frame and alter all downstream codons.\n- For spliced mRNAs, frame continuity across an exon junction requires that the upstream exon’s splice donor phase equal the downstream exon’s splice acceptor phase: phase $0$ joins to phase $0$, phase $1$ joins to phase $1$, and phase $2$ joins to phase $2$. A mismatch in phases indicates that the codon is interrupted improperly, causing a frameshift.\n\nStep $1$: Determine whether the existing deletion of exons $48$–$52$ is in-frame or out-of-frame via the triplet rule.\n\nCompute the cumulative coding length removed by the deletion of exons $48$–$52$:\n- Exon $48$: $123$\n- Exon $49$: $154$\n- Exon $50$: $120$\n- Exon $51$: $200$\n- Exon $52$: $142$\n\nSum these:\n$$123 + 154 = 277,$$\n$$277 + 120 = 397,$$\n$$397 + 200 = 597,$$\n$$597 + 142 = 739.$$\n\nNow evaluate $739 \\bmod 3$:\n- One way is to note $739 = 3 \\times 246 + 1$, so\n$$739 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}.$$\n\nBecause the net deleted length is $\\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, the resulting junction ($47 \\rightarrow 53$) is expected to be out-of-frame by the triplet rule. This explains a Duchenne muscular dystrophy phenotype rather than a Becker muscular dystrophy phenotype.\n\nStep $2$: Evaluate whether additional skipping of exon $53$ would restore the frame via the triplet rule.\n\nIf exon $53$ ($188$ nucleotides) is also skipped, the cumulative deleted length becomes:\n$$739 + 188 = 927.$$\n\nCompute $927 \\bmod 3$:\n- Note $927 = 3 \\times 309$, so\n$$927 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}.$$\n\nThe combined deletion of exons $48$–$53$ is divisible by $3$, which by the triplet rule would restore the reading frame, yielding an in-frame transcript and a Becker-like outcome if a stable protein is produced.\n\nStep $3$: Cross-check with splice phase compatibility.\n\nGiven splice phases:\n- Donor phase of exon $47$: $1$.\n- Acceptor phase of exon $53$: $2$.\n- Acceptor phase of exon $54$: $1$.\n\nFor the current junction $47 \\rightarrow 53$ after deletion of exons $48$–$52$, the donor phase ($1$) does not match the acceptor phase ($2$), which is consistent with an out-of-frame junction.\n\nIf exon $53$ is also skipped, the junction becomes $47 \\rightarrow 54$. Donor phase of exon $47$ is $1$, and acceptor phase of exon $54$ is $1$. These match, indicating an in-frame junction consistent with the modulo $3$ calculation above.\n\nConclusion: Both independent assessments (triplet rule and splice phase matching) agree that exon $53$ skipping would restore the reading frame for this deletion.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: It states that exon $53$ skipping restores an in-frame transcript because the cumulative deleted length becomes divisible by $3$ and the new junction ($47 \\rightarrow 54$) has matching phases. Our calculations show $739 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$ for exons $48$–$52$ (out-of-frame) and $927 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ when exon $53$ is added (in-frame), and donor/acceptor phases ($1$/$1$) match at $47 \\rightarrow 54$. Verdict: Correct.\n\n- Option B: It claims the cumulative deletion remains not divisible by $3$ and phases mismatch even after skipping exon $53$. This contradicts our findings: $927 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ and the phases at $47 \\rightarrow 54$ are $1$/$1$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option C: It asserts exon $53$ skipping restores the frame only if exon $54$ is also skipped, requiring a $47 \\rightarrow 55$ junction. Our data show restoration with $47 \\rightarrow 54$ because phases are $1$/$1$, and the cumulative deletion is divisible by $3$. No need to skip exon $54$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\n- Option D: It suggests that once the frame is restored, the downstream amino acid sequence is guaranteed to be identical to wild type due to the triplet property. This is false: restoring the frame prevents a catastrophic frameshift, but the protein still lacks the amino acids encoded by the skipped/deleted exons; the sequence downstream may be in-frame but not identical to wild type.
