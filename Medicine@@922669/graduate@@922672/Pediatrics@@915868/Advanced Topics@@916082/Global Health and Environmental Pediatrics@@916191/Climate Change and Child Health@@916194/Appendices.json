With the above assumptions, we have $R^{0} = R_0$. The risk ratio is $RR = R_1 / R_0$.\n\nThe PAF can now be written in terms of observable quantities:\n$$\n\\text{PAF} = \\frac{R - R_0}{R}\n$$\nBy the law of total probability, the overall population risk $R$ can be expressed as:\n$$\nR = \\Pr(Y=1) = \\Pr(Y=1 \\mid E=1)\\Pr(E=1) + \\Pr(Y=1 \\mid E=0)\\Pr(E=0)\n$$\n$$\nR = R_1 \\Pr(E=1) + R_0 \\Pr(E=0)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the PAF expression:\n$$\n\\text{PAF} = \\frac{(R_1 \\Pr(E=1) + R_0 \\Pr(E=0)) - R_0}{R}\n$$\nSince $\\Pr(E=0) = 1 - \\Pr(E=1)$, we have:\n$$\n\\text{PAF} = \\frac{R_1 \\Pr(E=1) + R_0 (1 - \\Pr(E=1)) - R_0}{R} = \\frac{R_1 \\Pr(E=1) + R_0 - R_0 \\Pr(E=1) - R_0}{R}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{PAF} = \\frac{(R_1 - R_0)\\Pr(E=1)}{R}\n$$\nNow we introduce $p = \\Pr(E=1 \\mid Y=1)$ and $RR = R_1/R_0$. Using Bayes' rule for $p$:\n$$\np = \\Pr(E=1 \\mid Y=1) = \\frac{\\Pr(Y=1 \\mid E=1)\\Pr(E=1)}{\\Pr(Y=1)} = \\frac{R_1 \\Pr(E=1)}{R}\n$$\nWe need to relate the expression for PAF to $p$ and $RR$. The numerator of our PAF expression is $(R_1 - R_0)\\Pr(E=1)$. Let's manipulate this:\n$$\n(R_1 - R_0)\\Pr(E=1) = R_1 \\Pr(E=1) - R_0 \\Pr(E=1)\n$$\nFrom the expression for $p$, we have $R_1 \\Pr(E=1) = p \\cdot R$. Substituting this:\n$$\n(R_1 - R_0)\\Pr(E=1) = p \\cdot R - R_0 \\Pr(E=1)\n$$\nThis does not seem to simplify easily. Let's try an alternative path. We have two expressions:\n$$\n\\text{PAF} = \\frac{(R_1-R_0)\\Pr(E=1)}{R} = \\frac{(R_1/R_0 - 1)R_0 \\Pr(E=1)}{R} = \\frac{(RR-1)R_0 \\Pr(E=1)}{R}\n$$\n$$\np = \\frac{R_1 \\Pr(E=1)}{R} = \\frac{RR \\cdot R_0 \\Pr(E=1)}{R}\n$$\nFrom the second equation, we can write $R_0 \\Pr(E=1) = \\frac{p \\cdot R}{RR}$.\nNow, substitute this into a rearranged PAF expression:\n$$\n\\text{PAF} = (RR-1) \\frac{R_0 \\Pr(E=1)}{R} = (RR-1) \\frac{p \\cdot R / RR}{R}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{PAF} = (RR-1) \\frac{p}{RR} = \\frac{p(RR-1)}{RR}\n$$\nThis derivation successfully expresses PAF in terms of only $p$ and $RR$.\n\nThe second part of the question requires articulating the assumptions for a causal interpretation. As outlined in the derivation, the formula $\\text{PAF} = \\frac{p(RR-1)}{RR}$ provides a causal estimate of the proportion of cases attributable to the exposure only if certain assumptions hold in the context of the observational pediatric cohort. These assumptions are:\n1.  **Consistency**: For each child in the study, their potential outcome under the exposure they received is the outcome that was actually observed. For example, if a child was not exposed to an extreme heat episode, their observed health status is assumed to be the same as their health status would have been in the counterfactual scenario where they were not exposed. This is a definitional assumption that connects the unobserved potential outcomes to the observed data.\n\n2.  **Exchangeability (No Unmeasured Confounding)**: This is the most critical and often untestable assumption for causal inference in observational studies. It requires that the group of children exposed to extreme heat and the group not exposed are comparable with respect to all other factors that could influence the acute health outcome. In other words, there are no common causes of both extreme heat exposure and the pediatric health outcome that are not accounted for. For instance, if children living in low-income housing with poor insulation are both more likely to experience high indoor temperatures (exposure) and are at higher baseline risk for acute morbidity due to other factors (e.g., diet, access to care), then socioeconomic status is a confounder. If variables like socioeconomic status, housing quality, or preexisting health conditions are not measured and adjusted for, exchangeability is violated. The estimated PAF would be biased and could not be interpreted as the causal proportion of disease that would be prevented by eliminating extreme heat exposure.\n\n3.  **Positivity**: For every combination of confounders, there must be a non-zero probability of being both exposed and unexposed. In this context, it means that at every level of confounding factors (e.g., within every socioeconomic stratum), there are some children who are exposed to extreme heat and some who are not. This ensures that a comparison between exposed and unexposed is possible across the entire study population.\n\nIf these assumptions hold, the derived expression represents the true causal population attributable fraction.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{p(RR-1)}{RR}}\n$$", "id": "5119395"}]}
