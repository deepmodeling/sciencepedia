Within three mutually exclusive and exhaustive age intervals, the observed counts of deaths are: $250$ deaths in $0$–$28$ days (neonatal), $150$ deaths in $29$ days–$11$ months (post-neonatal infancy), and $100$ deaths in $12$–$59$ months (early childhood).\n\nStarting only from the core epidemiologic definitions that a mortality rate for a defined age interval in a birth cohort equals the number of deaths in that interval divided by the number of live births, and that the survival probability across disjoint age intervals equals the product of the interval-specific survival probabilities, compute the following:\n\n- The Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) per $1{,}000$ live births.\n- The Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) per $1{,}000$ live births.\n- The Under-Five Mortality Rate (U5MR) per $1{,}000$ live births.\n- The under-five survival probability to age five years as a decimal, using the product of conditional interval survivals derived from the observed deaths.\n\nThen demonstrate internal consistency by showing that the under-five mortality probability equals one minus the under-five survival probability, and that when expressed per $1{,}000$ this equals the computed U5MR.\n\nExpress NMR, IMR, and U5MR per $1{,}000$ live births, and the survival probability as a unitless decimal.

The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe are given the following information for a closed birth cohort:\n- Number of live births: $N_{LB} = 10,000$.\n- Neonatal deaths ($0$–$28$ days): $d_N = 250$.\n- Post-neonatal deaths ($29$ days–$11$ months): $d_{PN} = 150$.\n- Early childhood deaths ($12$–$59$ months): $d_C = 100$.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of four quantities: the Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR), Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), Under-Five Mortality Rate (U5MR), and the under-five survival probability ($S_{U5}$). It also requires a demonstration of internal consistency. All final numerical values must be rounded to four significant figures.\n\nFirst, we compute the mortality rates per $1,000$ live births based on the provided definition: rate = (number of deaths in interval) / (number of live births).\n\n1.  **Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR)**\n    The NMR is based on deaths occurring in the neonatal period ($0$–$28$ days).\n    The number of neonatal deaths is $d_N = 250$.\n    The NMR, expressed per $1,000$ live births, is calculated as:\n    $$\n    \\text{NMR} = \\frac{d_N}{N_{LB}} \\times 1,000 = \\frac{250}{10,000} \\times 1,000 = 0.025 \\times 1,000 = 25\n    $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get $25.00$.\n\n2.  **Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)**\n    The IMR is based on deaths occurring in the first year of life (infancy), which includes both the neonatal and post-neonatal periods.\n    The total number of infant deaths is $d_I = d_N + d_{PN} = 250 + 150 = 400$.\n    The IMR, expressed per $1,000$ live births, is calculated as:\n    $$\n    \\text{IMR} = \\frac{d_I}{N_{LB}} \\times 1,000 = \\frac{400}{10,000} \\times 1,000 = 0.04 \\times 1,000 = 40\n    $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get $40.00$.\n\n3.  **Under-Five Mortality Rate (U5MR)**\n    The U5MR is based on all deaths occurring before the age of five years ($0$–$59$ months). This includes all three specified age intervals.\n    The total number of under-five deaths is $d_{U5} = d_N + d_{PN} + d_C = 250 + 150 + 100 = 500$.\n    The U5MR, expressed per $1,000$ live births, is calculated as:\n    $$\n    \\text{U5MR} = \\frac{d_{U5}}{N_{LB}} \\times 1,000 = \\frac{500}{10,000} \\times 1,000 = 0.05 \\times 1,000 = 50\n    $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get $50.00$.\n\nNext, we compute the under-five survival probability by calculating the product of conditional survival probabilities for each disjoint age interval, as instructed. This is a life-table method. Let $p_i$ be the conditional probability of surviving interval $i$.\n\n-   **Interval 1 (Neonatal):** The number of children at risk at the start is $N_1 = N_{LB} = 10,000$. The number of deaths is $d_1 = 250$.\n    The conditional probability of surviving this interval is $p_1 = 1 - \\frac{d_1}{N_1} = 1 - \\frac{250}{10,000} = \\frac{9,750}{10,000}$.\n\n-   **Interval 2 (Post-neonatal):** The number of children at risk at the start is the number who survived the neonatal period, $N_2 = N_1 - d_1 = 10,000 - 250 = 9,750$. The number of deaths is $d_2 = 150$.\n    The conditional probability of surviving this interval is $p_2 = 1 - \\frac{d_2}{N_2} = 1 - \\frac{150}{9,750} = \\frac{9,600}{9,750}$.\n\n-   **Interval 3 (Early childhood):** The number of children at risk at the start is the number who survived infancy, $N_3 = N_2 - d_2 = 9,750 - 150 = 9,600$. The number of deaths is $d_3 = 100$.\n    The conditional probability of surviving this interval is $p_3 = 1 - \\frac{d_3}{N_3} = 1 - \\frac{100}{9,600} = \\frac{9,500}{9,600}$.\n\n4.  **Under-Five Survival Probability ($S_{U5}$)**\n    The overall probability of surviving to age five is the product of the conditional survival probabilities for each interval:\n    $$\n    S_{U5} = p_1 \\times p_2 \\times p_3 = \\frac{9,750}{10,000} \\times \\frac{9,600}{9,750} \\times \\frac{9,500}{9,600}\n    $$\n    The terms cancel, leaving:\n    $$\n    S_{U5} = \\frac{9,500}{10,000} = 0.95\n    $$\n    This result is equivalent to the total number of survivors at age five ($10,000 - 500 = 9,500$) divided by the initial number of live births.\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get $0.9500$.\n\nFinally, we demonstrate internal consistency as requested.\nThe under-five mortality probability, $Q_{U5}$, is the total number of deaths before age five divided by the number of live births:\n$$\nQ_{U5} = \\frac{d_{U5}}{N_{LB}} = \\frac{500}{10,000} = 0.05\n$$\nThe first consistency check is to show that this equals one minus the survival probability:\n$$\n1 - S_{U5} = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 = Q_{U5}\n$$\nThis identity holds, confirming consistency.\n\nThe second consistency check is to show that the U5MR is equivalent to the under-five mortality probability expressed per $1,000$:\n$$\nQ_{U5} \\times 1,000 = 0.05 \\times 1,000 = 50\n$$\nThis value of $50$ is identical to the U5MR of $50$ per $1,000$ live births calculated earlier. This also confirms consistency.\n\nThe four required quantities, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n-   NMR: $25.00$\n-   IMR: $40.00$\n-   U5MR: $50.00$\n-   Under-five survival probability: $0.9500$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 25.00  40.00  50.00  0.9500 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5147949"}, {"introduction": "Moving from population-level measurement to individual patient care, this practice addresses one of the most common and preventable causes of child death: dehydration from diarrhea.
