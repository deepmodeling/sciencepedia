The amount decreases as it leaves the liver in venous blood ($Q_{\\mathrm{h}} C_{\\mathrm{v,l}}$) and through metabolism. In the well-stirred model, the concentration in the exiting venous blood, $C_{\\mathrm{v,l}}$, is in equilibrium with the total liver concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{l}}$, such that $C_{\\mathrm{v,l}} = C_{\\mathrm{l}} / P_{\\mathrm{l}}$. The rate of metabolism is given by the product of the intrinsic clearance $CL_{\\mathrm{int}}$ and the unbound concentration in the liver, which is $f_{u} C_{\\mathrm{v,l}}$.\n    Rate of change = (in from gut) + (in from blood) - (out to blood) - (metabolism)\n    $$ \\frac{dA_{\\mathrm{l}}}{dt} = k_{a} A_{\\mathrm{g}}(t) + Q_{\\mathrm{h}} C_{\\mathrm{c}}(t) - Q_{\\mathrm{h}} C_{\\mathrm{v,l}}(t) - CL_{\\mathrm{int}} f_{u} C_{\\mathrm{v,l}}(t) $$\n    Substituting $C_{\\mathrm{c}}(t) = A_{\\mathrm{c}}(t)/V_{\\mathrm{c}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{v,l}}(t) = C_{\\mathrm{l}}(t)/P_{\\mathrm{l}} = A_{\\mathrm{l}}(t)/(V_{\\mathrm{l}}P_{\\mathrm{l}})$:\n    $$ \\frac{dA_{\\mathrm{l}}}{dt} = k_{a} A_{\\mathrm{g}}(t) + Q_{\\mathrm{h}} \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{c}}(t)}{V_{\\mathrm{c}}} - (Q_{\\mathrm{h}} + f_{u} CL_{\\mathrm{int}}) \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{l}}(t)}{V_{\\mathrm{l}} P_{\\mathrm{l}}} $$\n\n3.  **Peripheral Compartment ($A_{\\mathrm{p}}$):** For a perfusion-limited peripheral tissue, the rate of change of amount $A_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)$ is the difference between the rate of delivery from systemic blood ($Q_{\\mathrm{p}} C_{\\mathrm{c}}$) and the rate of return to systemic blood ($Q_{\\mathrm{p}} C_{\\mathrm{v,p}}$). The venous effluent concentration $C_{\\mathrm{v,p}}$ is assumed to be in equilibrium with the tissue concentration, so $C_{\\mathrm{v,p}} = C_{\\mathrm{p}} / P_{\\mathrm{p}}$.\n    $$ \\frac{dA_{\\mathrm{p}}}{dt} = Q_{\\mathrm{p}} C_{\\mathrm{c}}(t) - Q_{\\mathrm{p}} C_{\\mathrm{v,p}}(t) = Q_{\\mathrm{p}} \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{c}}(t)}{V_{\\mathrm{c}}} - Q_{\\mathrm{p}} \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)}{V_{\\mathrm{p}} P_{\\mathrm{p}}} $$\n\n4.  **Systemic Blood Compartment ($A_{\\mathrm{c}}$):** The amount in the central blood compartment, $A_{\\mathrm{c}}(t)$, is the sum of inflows from the liver and periphery, minus the outflows to the liver and periphery.\n    Rate of change = (in from liver) + (in from periphery) - (out to liver) - (out to periphery)\n    $$ \\frac{dA_{\\mathrm{c}}}{dt} = Q_{\\mathrm{h}} C_{\\mathrm{v,l}}(t) + Q_{\\mathrm{p}} C_{\\mathrm{v,p}}(t) - Q_{\\mathrm{h}} C_{\\mathrm{c}}(t) - Q_{\\mathrm{p}} C_{\\mathrm{c}}(t) $$\n    Substituting the expressions for the concentrations:\n    $$ \\frac{dA_{\\mathrm{c}}}{dt} = Q_{\\mathrm{h}} \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{l}}(t)}{V_{\\mathrm{l}} P_{\\mathrm{l}}} + Q_{\\mathrm{p}} \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)}{V_{\\mathrm{p}} P_{\\mathrm{p}}} - (Q_{\\mathrm{h}} + Q_{\\mathrm{p}}) \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{c}}(t)}{V_{\\mathrm{c}}} $$\n\n**Task 2: Derivation of Steady-State Concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$)**\n\nAt steady state (denoted by the subscript 'ss'), the rate of change of the amount in each compartment is zero.\n$$ \\frac{dA_{\\mathrm{g}}}{dt} = \\frac{dA_{\\mathrm{l}}}{dt} = \\frac{dA_{\\mathrm{p}}}{dt} = \\frac{dA_{\\mathrm{c}}}{dt} = 0 $$\nWe solve the resulting system of algebraic equations for the steady-state systemic blood concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{c,ss}} = A_{\\mathrm{c,ss}}/V_{\\mathrm{c}}$.\n\nFrom the gut lumen equation (1):\n$$ 0 = R_{\\mathrm{ing}} - (k_{a} + k_{f}) A_{\\mathrm{g,ss}} \\implies A_{\\mathrm{g,ss}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{ing}}}{k_{a} + k_{f}} $$\n\nFrom the peripheral compartment equation (3):\n$$ 0 = Q_{\\mathrm{p}} \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{c,ss}}}{V_{\\mathrm{c}}} - Q_{\\mathrm{p}} \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{p,ss}}}{V_{\\mathrm{p}} P_{\\mathrm{p}}} \\implies Q_{\\mathrm{p}} C_{\\mathrm{c,ss}} = Q_{\\mathrm{p}} \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{p,ss}}}{P_{\\mathrm{p}}} $$\nThis shows that the net flux between the blood and periphery is zero, and as $Q_{\\mathrm{p}}$ is non-zero, it cancels. The equation simplifies our work, but does not determine $C_{\\mathrm{c,ss}}$ directly. It gives us the relation $Q_{\\mathrm{p}} \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{p,ss}}}{V_{\\mathrm{p}} P_{\\mathrm{p}}} = Q_{\\mathrm{p}} \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{c,ss}}}{V_{\\mathrm{c}}}$.\n\nFrom the systemic blood equation (4):\n$$ 0 = Q_{\\mathrm{h}} \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{l,ss}}}{V_{\\mathrm{l}} P_{\\mathrm{l}}} + Q_{\\mathrm{p}} \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{p,ss}}}{V_{\\mathrm{p}} P_{\\mathrm{p}}} - (Q_{\\mathrm{h}} + Q_{\\mathrm{p}}) \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{c,ss}}}{V_{\\mathrm{c}}} $$\nSubstitute the result from the peripheral compartment:\n$$ 0 = Q_{\\mathrm{h}} \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{l,ss}}}{V_{\\mathrm{l}} P_{\\mathrm{l}}} + Q_{\\mathrm{p}} \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{c,ss}}}{V_{\\mathrm{c}}} - (Q_{\\mathrm{h}} + Q_{\\mathrm{p}}) \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{c,ss}}}{V_{\\mathrm{c}}} $$\n$$ 0 = Q_{\\mathrm{h}} \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{l,ss}}}{V_{\\mathrm{l}} P_{\\mathrm{l}}} - Q_{\\mathrm{h}} \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{c,ss}}}{V_{\\mathrm{c}}} \\implies \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{l,ss}}}{V_{\\mathrm{l}} P_{\\mathrm{l}}} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{c,ss}}}{V_{\\mathrm{c}}} \\implies C_{\\mathrm{v,l,ss}} = C_{\\mathrm{c,ss}} $$\nThis indicates that at steady state, the concentration of blood leaving the liver is equal to the systemic arterial concentration. This might seem counterintuitive, but it is a direct consequence of the PBPK structure where the central compartment's only inputs are the venous returns.\n\nNow, use the liver equation (2) at steady state:\n$$ 0 = k_{a} A_{\\mathrm{g,ss}} + Q_{\\mathrm{h}} \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{c,ss}}}{V_{\\mathrm{c}}} - (Q_{\\mathrm{h}} + f_{u} CL_{\\mathrm{int}}) \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{l,ss}}}{V_{\\mathrm{l}} P_{\\mathrm{l}}} $$\nSubstitute the steady-state relations found above: $A_{\\mathrm{g,ss}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{ing}}}{k_{a} + k_{f}}$ and $\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{l,ss}}}{V_{\\mathrm{l}} P_{\\mathrm{l}}} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{c,ss}}}{V_{\\mathrm{c}}} = C_{\\mathrm{c,ss}}$.\n$$ 0 = k_{a} \\left(\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{ing}}}{k_{a} + k_{f}}\\right) + Q_{\\mathrm{h}} C_{\\mathrm{c,ss}} - (Q_{\\mathrm{h}} + f_{u} CL_{\\mathrm{int}}) C_{\\mathrm{c,ss}} $$\n$$ k_{a} \\left(\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{ing}}}{k_{a} + k_{f}}\\right) = (Q_{\\mathrm{h}} + f_{u} CL_{\\mathrm{int}}) C_{\\mathrm{c,ss}} - Q_{\\mathrm{h}} C_{\\mathrm{c,ss}} $$\n$$ k_{a} \\left(\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{ing}}}{k_{a} + k_{f}}\\right) = f_{u} CL_{\\mathrm{int}} C_{\\mathrm{c,ss}} $$\nSolving for $C_{\\mathrm{c,ss}}$ gives the final analytical expression:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{c,ss}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{ing}}}{f_{u} CL_{\\mathrm{int}}} \\left(\\frac{k_{a}}{k_{a} + k_{f}}\\right) $$\nThis result demonstrates that for the well-stirred liver model under oral dosing, the steady-state systemic concentration is determined by the rate of absorption ($R_{\\mathrm{ing}} \\times \\frac{k_a}{k_a+k_f}$) and the intrinsic clearing capacity of the liver ($f_{u} CL_{\\mathrm{int}}$), and is independent of the liver blood flow $Q_{\\mathrm{h}}$.\n\n**Task 3: Numerical Computation of $C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$**\n\nFirst, convert the ingestion rate $R_{\\mathrm{ing}}$ to units of $\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\nDose rate = $5$ $\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$.\nChild weight = $15$ $\\mathrm{kg}$.\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{ing}} = 5 \\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{day}} \\times 15 \\, \\mathrm{kg} = 75 \\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{day}} $$\nConverting units to $\\mathrm{mg}$ and $\\mathrm{h}$:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{ing}} = 75 \\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{day}} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\mathrm{mg}}{1000 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\mathrm{day}}{24 \\, \\mathrm{h}} = \\frac{75}{24000} \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{h}} = 0.003125 \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{h}} $$\n\nThe other parameter values are:\n- $f_{u} = 0.10$\n- $CL_{\\mathrm{int}} = 50$ $\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- $k_{a} = 1.8$ $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- $k_{f} = 0.20$ $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the derived expression for $C_{\\mathrm{c,ss}}$:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{c,ss}} = \\frac{0.003125 \\, \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}}{0.10 \\times 50 \\, \\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}} \\left(\\frac{1.8 \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}}{1.8 \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1} + 0.20 \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}}\\right) $$\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{c,ss}} = \\frac{0.003125}{5} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\left(\\frac{1.8}{2.0}\\right) $$\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{c,ss}} = 0.000625 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times 0.9 $$\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{c,ss}} = 0.0005625 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{c,ss}} \\approx 0.000563 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}} $$\nThis value can be written in scientific notation as $5.63 \\times 10^{-4}$ $\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.000563}\n$$", "id": "5137227"}]}
