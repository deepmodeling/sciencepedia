A reasoned solution can be formulated.\n\n### Solution Formulation\n\nThe objective is to calculate the single dose of tacrolimus to be administered every $12$ hours to a child who is a CYP3A5 expresser. The calculation proceeds in three steps:\n1.  Calculate the total daily dose for a standard patient (nonexpresser) of the same weight.\n2.  Adjust this total daily dose for the patient's specific CYP3A5 expresser genotype using the given scaling factor.\n3.  Divide the adjusted total daily dose by the number of administrations per day to find the dose per administration.\n\nLet $W$ be the child's weight, $d_{\\text{base}}$ be the standard dose rate for nonexpressers, and $f_{\\text{geno}}$ be the genotype scaling factor.\n\nThe total daily dose for a nonexpresser, $D_{\\text{total, std}}$, is calculated by multiplying the base dose rate by the child's weight:\n$$D_{\\text{total, std}} = d_{\\text{base}} \\times W$$\nGiven values are $d_{\\text{base}} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$ and $W = 15\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n$$D_{\\text{total, std}} = (0.2\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}) \\times (15\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 3\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$$\n\nThis child is a CYP3A5 expresser (genotype $*1/*1$), requiring a dose adjustment. The problem states the initial dose is scaled by a factor of $f_{\\text{geno}} = 1.5$. The adjusted total daily dose for this specific patient, $D_{\\text{total, adj}}$, is:\n$$D_{\\text{total, adj}} = D_{\\text{total, std}} \\times f_{\\text{geno}}$$\n$$D_{\\text{total, adj}} = (3\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}) \\times 1.5 = 4.5\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$$\n\nThe total daily dose is administered in two equal doses every $12$ hours ($\\mathrm{q}12\\mathrm{h}$). Therefore, the number of administrations per day, $N$, is $2$. The dose per administration, $D_{\\text{admin}}$, is the adjusted total daily dose divided by $N$:\n$$D_{\\text{admin}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{total, adj}}}{N}$$\n$$D_{\\text{admin}} = \\frac{4.5\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{2} = 2.25\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $2.25\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ already contains exactly three significant figures ($2$, $2$, and $5$).

However, interpreting these levels requires a deep understanding of pharmacokinetic principles. This exercise challenges you to analyze a series of tacrolimus trough concentrations in the context of a changing physiological variable—hematocrit. By working through this scenario, you will learn to distinguish between the measured whole-blood concentration and the pharmacologically active unbound drug, a critical skill for avoiding misinterpretation and making sound clinical judgments [@problem_id:5186962].", "problem": "A $10$-year-old child, $8$ weeks after kidney transplantation, is receiving a fixed oral dose of tacrolimus. Over three consecutive clinic visits spaced $2$ weeks apart, the measured predose whole-blood tacrolimus trough concentrations are $8.5$ ng/mL, $5.6$ ng/mL, and $11.2$ ng/mL, respectively. The hematocrit at those visits is $28\\%$, $32\\%$, and $36\\%$, respectively. There were no intentional dose changes between visits. Using only fundamental definitions of drug distribution between plasma and erythrocytes and the principle that only unbound drug is pharmacologically active, which statement best interprets these data and their implications for dosing?\n\nA. Because tacrolimus partitions extensively into erythrocytes, a higher hematocrit increases the measured whole-blood concentration for the same unbound exposure; thus, the increase from $8.5$ ng/mL at $28\\%$ hematocrit to $11.2$ ng/mL at $36\\%$ hematocrit could reflect similar unbound exposure, whereas the isolated decrease to $5.6$ ng/mL at intermediate hematocrit likely represents a true reduction in exposure (for example, missed doses or increased clearance). Therefore, a dose reduction based solely on the $11.2$ ng/mL value would be premature; reassess adherence and interactions and interpret troughs in the context of hematocrit.\n\nB. Hematocrit does not influence tacrolimus whole-blood concentrations because tacrolimus is highly bound to plasma proteins; therefore, the values $8.5$, $5.6$, and $11.2$ ng/mL directly reflect changes in unbound exposure, mandating a dose increase after $5.6$ ng/mL and a dose decrease after $11.2$ ng/mL.\n\nC.

It describes a realistic clinical scenario involving tacrolimus, an immunosuppressant widely used in transplantation. The pharmacokinetic principle that tacrolimus partitions extensively into red blood cells (erythrocytes), making its whole-blood concentration dependent on hematocrit, is well-established. The provided concentration and hematocrit values are clinically plausible for a pediatric patient in the early post-transplant period, where hematocrit often rises as post-surgical anemia resolves. The guiding principle that unbound drug concentration determines pharmacological effect is a cornerstone of pharmacology.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear set of data and asks for the best interpretation among a finite set of options, based on specified fundamental principles. This structure allows for a unique, correct answer to be determined through logical deduction.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem statement is objective and quantitative, presenting clinical data without bias or subjective language.\n4.  **Completeness:** The problem is self-contained. It gives all necessary data and explicitly states the principles to be used for interpretation. It does not require external, unstated assumptions to arrive at a logical conclusion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information to proceed with a solution.\n\n## Derivation\nThe problem requires an interpretation based on the relationship between whole-blood concentration, plasma concentration, unbound concentration, and hematocrit. Let us define the relevant variables and derive this relationship from first principles.\n\nLet:\n- $C_{wb}$ be the tacrolimus concentration in whole blood (the measured quantity).\n- $C_{p}$ be the tacrolimus concentration in plasma.\n- $C_{rbc}$ be the tacrolimus concentration in red blood cells (erythrocytes).\n- $C_u$ be the unbound (pharmacologically active) tacrolimus concentration in plasma.\n- $Hct$ be the hematocrit, expressed as a volume fraction (e.g., $28\\%$ is $Hct=0.28$).\n- $f_u$ be the fraction of tacrolimus unbound in plasma, so that $C_u = f_u \\cdot C_p$. We assume $f_u$ is constant.\n- $K_{rbc/p}$ be the partition coefficient between red blood cells and plasma, defined as $K_{rbc/p} = C_{rbc} / C_p$.\n\nThe total mass of drug in a unit volume of whole blood is the sum of the mass in the plasma fraction and the mass in the red blood cell fraction. The volume of the plasma fraction is $(1 - Hct)$ and the volume of the red blood cell fraction is $Hct$.\n\nTherefore, the whole-blood concentration is a weighted average:\n$$C_{wb} = C_{p} \\cdot (1 - Hct) + C_{rbc} \\cdot Hct$$\n\nSubstituting $C_{rbc} = K_{rbc/p} \\cdot C_p$ into the equation:\n$$C_{wb} = C_{p} \\cdot (1 - Hct) + (K_{rbc/p} \\cdot C_p) \\cdot Hct$$\n$$C_{wb} = C_p \\cdot [ (1 - Hct) + K_{rbc/p} \\cdot Hct ]$$\n$$C_{wb} = C_p \\cdot [ 1 - Hct + K_{rbc/p} \\cdot Hct ]$$\n$$C_{wb} = C_p \\cdot [ 1 + (K_{rbc/p} - 1) \\cdot Hct ]$$\n\nThe goal is to understand the pharmacologically active unbound concentration, $C_u$. We relate $C_{wb}$ to $C_u$ by substituting $C_p = C_u / f_u$:\n$$C_{wb} = \\frac{C_u}{f_u} \\cdot [ 1 + (K_{rbc/p} - 1) \\cdot Hct ]$$\n\nIt is a well-established property of tacrolimus that it partitions extensively into erythrocytes, meaning $K_{rbc/p} \\gg 1$. Consequently, the term $(K_{rbc/p} - 1)$ is a large positive constant.\n\nFrom the derived equation, if the unbound exposure ($C_u$) and patient-specific constants ($f_u$, $K_{rbc/p}$) are held constant, the measured whole-blood concentration ($C_{wb}$) is a direct, increasing function of hematocrit ($Hct$):\n$$C_{wb} \\propto [ 1 + (K_{rbc/p} - 1) \\cdot Hct ]$$\nThis means that for the same level of unbound, active drug, a patient with a higher hematocrit will have a higher measured whole-blood tacrolimus concentration.\n\nNow, we apply this principle to the patient's data:\n- Visit 1: $Hct_1 = 0.28$, $C_{wb,1} = 8.5$ ng/mL.\n- Visit 2: $Hct_2 = 0.32$, $C_{wb,2} = 5.6$ ng/mL.\n- Visit 3: $Hct_3 = 0.36$, $C_{wb,3} = 11.2$ ng/mL.\n\nAnalysis of the trend:\n- **Visit 1 to Visit 2:** $Hct$ increased from $0.28$ to $0.32$. If unbound exposure ($C_u$) were constant, $C_{wb}$ should have increased. Instead, $C_{wb}$ decreased significantly from $8.5$ to $5.6$ ng/mL. This contradicts the expectation for constant exposure and strongly implies that the true unbound exposure ($C_u$) must have actually decreased. This could be due to non-adherence (e.g., missed doses) or a change in drug clearance.\n- **Visit 1 to Visit 3:** $Hct$ increased from $0.28$ to $0.36$. $C_{wb}$ increased from $8.5$ to $11.2$ ng/mL. This trend is consistent with the model. The increase in $C_{wb}$ is expected due to the rising $Hct$. It is plausible that the unbound exposure ($C_u$) remained relatively stable between these two points, with the change in $C_{wb}$ being driven primarily by the change in $Hct$.\n- **Conclusion:** The dip to $5.6$ ng/mL is a true, clinically significant drop in drug exposure. The rise to $11.2$ ng/mL is at least partially an artifact of the rising hematocrit. Therefore, making a dosing decision solely based on the $C_{wb}=11.2$ ng/mL value, without considering the change in hematocrit and the anomalous value at the preceding visit, would be premature and potentially harmful.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Because tacrolimus partitions extensively into erythrocytes, a higher hematocrit increases the measured whole-blood concentration for the same unbound exposure; thus, the increase from $8.5$ ng/mL at $28\\%$ hematocrit to $11.2$ ng/mL at $36\\%$ hematocrit could reflect similar unbound exposure, whereas the isolated decrease to $5.6$ ng/mL at intermediate hematocrit likely represents a true reduction in exposure (for example, missed doses or increased clearance). Therefore, a dose reduction based solely on the $11.2$ ng/mL value would be premature; reassess adherence and interactions and interpret troughs in the context of hematocrit.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivation. The initial premise is correct. The interpretation of the data points—that the $8.5$ to $11.2$ ng/mL change could reflect stable unbound exposure with rising hematocrit, while the $5.6$ ng/mL value represents a true drop in exposure—is logical. The resulting clinical recommendation to investigate further before adjusting the dose is the correct and prudent course of action.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Hematocrit does not influence tacrolimus whole-blood concentrations because tacrolimus is highly bound to plasma proteins; therefore, the values $8.5$, $5.6$, and $11.2$ ng/mL directly reflect changes in unbound exposure, mandating a dose increase after $5.6$ ng/mL and a dose decrease after $11.2$ ng/mL.**\nThis statement's primary premise is false. As derived, hematocrit *does* influence whole-blood concentration precisely because tacrolimus partitions into erythrocytes. While tacrolimus is also protein-bound in plasma, this does not negate the effect of red blood cell partitioning. The conclusion that the measured values directly reflect unbound exposure is therefore incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. As hematocrit rises, whole-blood tacrolimus concentrations fall for the same unbound exposure due to dilution into a larger plasma volume; therefore, the $11.2$ ng/mL value indicates a marked rise in unbound tacrolimus and an elevated toxicity risk, warranting an immediate dose reduction.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As hematocrit rises, the plasma volume fraction $(1-Hct)$ *decreases*, not increases. Furthermore, our derivation showed that for the same unbound exposure, $C_{wb}$ *rises* with $Hct$, not falls. The premise is the opposite of the correct relationship. The conclusion is therefore based on flawed reasoning.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Whole-blood tacrolimus concentrations track unbound concentrations independently of hematocrit; the observed variability is most consistent with analytical noise and should be ignored in dosing decisions.**\nThe first part of this statement is false. As established in the derivation, $C_{wb}$ is dependent on $Hct$. The second part is a poor clinical judgment; the magnitude of the concentration changes (nearly a $50\\%$ drop followed by a $100\\%$ rise) is far too large to be dismissed as simple analytical noise and points to significant pharmacokinetic or adherence-related events.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5186962"}, {"introduction": "For some immunosuppressants, a single point-in-time concentration does not adequately reflect the patient's total drug exposure.
