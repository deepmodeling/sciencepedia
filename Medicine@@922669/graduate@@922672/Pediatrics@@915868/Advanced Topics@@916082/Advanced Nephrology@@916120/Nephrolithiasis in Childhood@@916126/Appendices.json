The values are clinically plausible for a pediatric patient.\n\nThe task is to compute the daily urinary calcium excretion per kilogram of body weight, denoted by $E$, and an indicator variable $H$ based on the provided clinical data. The fundamental principle to be used is the conservation of mass, which states that the total mass of a substance in a given volume is the product of its concentration and the volume.\n\nThe given data are:\n- Total urine volume over a $24$-hour period: $V = 1275\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n- Urinary calcium concentration: $C_{\\mathrm{Ca}} = 9.8\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n- Body weight of the child: $W = 24.7\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Time period of collection: $T = 24\\,\\mathrm{h} = 1\\,\\mathrm{day}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total mass of calcium excreted, $M_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$, in the $24$-hour period.

Monitor blood pressure and electrolytes and perform renal ultrasonography every $6$–$12$ months.**\n\nThis option is a comprehensive, evidence-based plan.\n- **Diagnostic Step**: Confirming with a second $24$-hour urine is standard practice.\n- **Fluid Intake**: Targets low urine volume (Principle ii) with a specific, appropriate goal.\n- **Dietary Measures**: Correctly advises normal calcium intake (avoiding dietary restriction which can increase oxalate absorption), targets high sodium intake (Principle iv), and provides sensible oxalate advice.\n- **Medical Therapy**: Addresses hypocitraturia with potassium citrate (Principle iii) with an appropriate citrate target. The pH target of $6.5$–$7.0$ maximizes citrate's benefit without significantly increasing the risk of calcium phosphate stone formation.\n- **Stepwise Approach**: Wisely reserves thiazide diuretics (Principle v) for persistent hypercalciuria after conservative measures have been implemented.\n- **Monitoring**: Includes appropriate biochemical (repeat $24$-hour urine with clear targets) and imaging (ultrasound, not CT) follow-up at reasonable intervals, including safety monitoring (electrolytes).\n\nVerdict: **Correct**. This pathway directly and appropriately addresses every identified risk factor using the stated principles in a logical, stepwise, and measurable fashion.\n\n**B. Restrict dietary calcium to $ 300$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$ to lower urinary calcium, avoid citrate because urine alkalinization promotes calcium phosphate stones, target urine pH $ 6.0$, and use a loop diuretic to increase urine flow. Monitor with monthly spot urine calcium-to-creatinine ratios and annual kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) radiography; no $24$-hour urine needed.**\n\nThis option contains multiple fundamental errors.\n- **Calcium Restriction**: This is contraindicated. It can lead to a negative calcium balance and increase intestinal oxalate absorption, potentially worsening stone formation.\n- **Avoid Citrate**: Directly contradicts Principle (iii) and ignores the patient's significant hypocitraturia. The risk of calcium phosphate stones is managed by controlling pH, not by withholding a critical inhibitor.\n- **pH Target $ 6.0$**: Unhelpful and potentially detrimental as it can decrease uric acid solubility.\n- **Loop Diuretic**: This is pharmacologically incorrect. Loop diuretics cause *hypercalciuria* and would worsen the patient's primary metabolic abnormality. Thiazides are hypocalciuric (Principle v).\n- **Monitoring**: Inadequate. Spot ratios are insufficient for comprehensive management, and KUB is less sensitive than ultrasound for non-obstructing stones and involves radiation.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Begin a thiazide diuretic immediately and add high-dose vitamin D to improve bone mineralization; limit evening fluids to reduce nocturia, targeting a urine volume $ 0.8$ $\\mathrm{L/day}$. Do not restrict sodium to avoid hyponatremia. Follow with yearly Computed Tomography (CT) scans; $24$-hour urine testing is unnecessary.**\n\nThis option is flawed and potentially harmful.\n- **Immediate Thiazide**: Skips essential first-line dietary and behavioral therapy.\n- **High-Dose Vitamin D**: Dangerous in a patient with normal vitamin D levels and idiopathic hypercalciuria, as it can worsen the hypercalciuria.\n- **Fluid Target**: The target of $ 0.8$ $\\mathrm{L/day}$ is the patient's current inadequate volume; this is not a therapeutic goal. Limiting fluids is counter to Principle (ii).\n- **No Sodium Restriction**: Ignores a primary cause of the patient's hypercalciuria (Principle iv) and the fact that thiazide efficacy is enhanced by sodium restriction.\n- **Monitoring**: Yearly CT scans confer an unacceptable radiation burden on a child. Ultrasound is the standard. Forgoing $24$-hour urine tests makes rational therapy impossible.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Treat presumed hyperoxaluria by eliminating dietary calcium and adding pyridoxine; set urine pH $ 7.5$ to dissolve calcium oxalate. Assess response with weekly home urine pH strips and serum oxalate; defer imaging unless symptoms recur.**\n\nThis option misdiagnoses the problem and proposes dangerous interventions.\n- **Misdiagnosis**: The primary issues are hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia, not hyperoxaluria (the level is borderline). Pyridoxine is for primary hyperoxaluria, which is not the diagnosis here.\n- **Eliminate Dietary Calcium**: Incorrect and harmful, as previously noted.\n- **pH Target $ 7.5$**: Extremely dangerous. Calcium oxalate is not soluble at high pH. This pH level will cause rapid precipitation of calcium phosphate.\n- **Monitoring**: Serum oxalate is not a useful marker. Deferring imaging is imprudent in a patient with active, recurrent disease.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Provide potassium citrate and encourage fluids but set the citrate goal at $ 150$ $\\mathrm{mg/1.73\\,m^2/day}$ and urine pH $ 7.5$; modest sodium reduction without urine sodium targets; maintain normal calcium intake. Recheck a $24$-hour urine at $4$ weeks and repeat ultrasonography in $3$ years if asymptomatic.**\n\nThis option contains correct ideas but implements them with flawed targets.\n- **Citrate Goal**: The target of $ 150$ $\\mathrm{mg/1.73\\,m^2/day}$ is clinically meaningless as the patient's baseline is already $220$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$. This is not a therapeutic goal.\n- **pH Target $ 7.5$**: Incorrect and promotes calcium phosphate precipitation.\n- **Sodium Reduction**: The recommendation is vague (\"modest\") and lacks a measurable target, making it difficult to implement and monitor effectively.\n- **Monitoring**: An ultrasound interval of $3$ years is far too long for a young, recurrent stone former.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5175300"}]}
