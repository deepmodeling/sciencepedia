It is scientifically sound, formally structured, complete, and contains no contradictions.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe total amount of bicarbonate required over the $24$-hour period, denoted as $D_{\\text{total}}$, must serve two purposes:\n1.  Correct the existing bicarbonate deficit to raise the serum concentration to the target level. This dose is denoted as $D_{\\text{deficit}}$.\n2.  Neutralize the net acid that is produced and retained over the $24$-hour period, preventing a further drop in bicarbonate. This dose is denoted as $D_{\\text{ongoing}}$.\n\nThe total dose is the sum of these two components:\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = D_{\\text{deficit}} + D_{\\text{ongoing}}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dose required to correct the existing deficit, $D_{\\text{deficit}}$. This is determined by the desired change in bicarbonate concentration and the volume over which this change must occur, known as the bicarbonate space.\n\nThe change in bicarbonate concentration, $\\Delta[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$, is:\n$$\\Delta[\\text{HCO}_3^-] = [\\text{HCO}_3^-]_{\\text{target}} - [\\text{HCO}_3^-]_{\\text{initial}} = 22 \\ \\text{mmol/L} - 16 \\ \\text{mmol/L} = 6 \\ \\text{mmol/L}$$\n\nThe bicarbonate distribution volume, $V_{d, \\text{HCO}_3^-}$, is calculated using the child's weight and the provided distribution factor:\n$$V_{d, \\text{HCO}_3^-} = (0.5 \\ \\text{L/kg}) \\times W = (0.5 \\ \\text{L/kg}) \\times (28 \\ \\text{kg}) = 14 \\ \\text{L}$$\n\nThe total amount of bicarbonate needed to fill this deficit is the product of the concentration change and the distribution volume. Given the equivalence of mmol and mEq, we have:\n$$D_{\\text{deficit}} = \\Delta[\\text{HCO}_3^-] \\times V_{d, \\text{HCO}_3^-} = (6 \\ \\text{mEq/L}) \\times (14 \\ \\text{L}) = 84 \\ \\text{mEq}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the dose required to balance the ongoing acid retention, $D_{\\text{ongoing}}$. This is equal to the net acid retained by the body over the $24$-hour period. Net acid retained is the difference between the total endogenous acid produced (NEAP) and the total acid excreted by the kidneys (NAE) over that time.\n\nThe total Net Endogenous Acid Production over $24$ hours ($NEAP_{\\text{total}}$) is:\n$$NEAP_{\\text{total}} = (\\text{NEAP rate}) \\times W = (1.2 \\ \\text{mEq/kg/day}) \\times (28 \\ \\text{kg}) = 33.6 \\ \\text{mEq/day}$$\n\nThe Net Acid Excretion (NAE) is given as $12 \\ \\text{mEq/day}$.\nThe net amount of acid retained over the $24$-hour period, $A_{\\text{retained}}$, is:\n$$A_{\\text{retained}} = NEAP_{\\text{total}} - NAE = 33.6 \\ \\text{mEq/day} - 12 \\ \\text{mEq/day} = 21.6 \\ \\text{mEq/day}$$\n\nTo neutralize this retained acid and prevent the bicarbonate concentration from falling, an equivalent amount of bicarbonate must be administered. Therefore, for the $24$-hour interval:\n$$D_{\\text{ongoing}} = A_{\\text{retained}} = 21.6 \\ \\text{mEq}$$\n\nFinally, the total required dose, $D_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the deficit correction dose and the ongoing replacement dose:\n$$D_{\\text{total}} = D_{\\text{deficit}} + D_{\\text{ongoing}} = 84 \\ \\text{mEq} + 21.6 \\ \\text{mEq} = 105.6 \\ \\text{mEq}$$\n\nThe total required oral sodium bicarbonate dose over the next $24$ hours is $105.6 \\ \\text{mEq}$.

It is free of subjective language or opinion.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard, solvable problem in clinical acid-base physiology.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe first step is to characterize the acid-base disorder using the provided arterial blood gas (ABG) values.\nThe patient's arterial $\\mathrm{pH}$ is $7.16$, which is below the normal range (typically $7.35-7.45$), indicating an acidemia.\nThe serum bicarbonate concentration, $[\\mathrm{HCO}_3^-]$, is $14$ mmol/L, which is low (normal range is typically $22-26$ mmol/L). A low bicarbonate in the setting of acidemia points to a primary metabolic acidosis.\nThe arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, $P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2}$, is $41$ mmHg, which is at the upper end of the normal range (typically $35-45$ mmHg).\n\nBefore proceeding, we can check the internal consistency of the ABG values using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$ \\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_a + \\log_{10}\\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{HCO}_3^-]}{\\alpha \\cdot P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2}} \\right) $$\nUsing the standard physiological constants for the carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer system, the apparent acid dissociation constant $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ is $6.1$ and the solubility coefficient for $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ in plasma, $\\alpha$, is $0.03$ mmol L$^{-1}$ mmHg$^{-1}$.\n$$ \\mathrm{pH} = 6.1 + \\log_{10}\\left( \\frac{14}{0.03 \\times 41} \\right) = 6.1 + \\log_{10}\\left( \\frac{14}{1.23} \\right) \\approx 6.1 + \\log_{10}(11.38) \\approx 6.1 + 1.056 = 7.156 $$\nThis calculated $\\mathrm{pH}$ of $7.156$ is in excellent agreement with the measured $\\mathrm{pH}$ of $7.16$, confirming the validity of the provided data.\n\nThe primary disorder is a metabolic acidosis. In a simple metabolic acidosis, the physiological response is respiratory compensation, which involves increasing the minute ventilation to \"blow off\" $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ and thereby lower the $P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2}$. The expected degree of compensation can be predicted using Winter's formula:\n$$ P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2,\\mathrm{expected}} = (1.5 \\times [\\mathrm{HCO}_3^-]) + 8 \\pm 2 $$\nUsing the patient's bicarbonate level of $14$ mmol/L:\n$$ P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2,\\mathrm{expected}} = (1.5 \\times 14) + 8 = 21 + 8 = 29\\,\\text{mmHg} $$\nThe expected compensatory range for $P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2}$ is therefore $27-31$ mmHg.\n\nThe patient’s measured $P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2}$ is $41$ mmHg. This value is significantly higher than the expected compensatory value of $29$ mmHg. When the measured $P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2}$ is higher than expected, it indicates an inadequate respiratory compensation. In this case, because the $P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2}$ is not only above the expected compensatory range but is also in the physiologically acidotic range itself, it signifies a superimposed, or co-existing, primary respiratory acidosis. This finding is consistent with the patient's clinical history of daytime somnolence and apneas, which are signs of hypoventilation leading to $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ retention. The patient, therefore, has a mixed acid-base disorder: a primary metabolic acidosis (due to CKD) and a primary respiratory acidosis (due to a hypoventilatory comorbidity).\n\nThe problem asks for the numeric value of the difference, $\\Delta P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2}$, defined as:\n$$ \\Delta P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2} = P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2,\\mathrm{measured}} - P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2,\\mathrm{expected}} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\Delta P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2} = 41\\,\\text{mmHg} - 29\\,\\text{mmHg} = 12\\,\\text{mmHg} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
