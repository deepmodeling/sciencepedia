The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria provide this essential framework, using changes in serum creatinine and urine output. This practice challenges you to meticulously apply these criteria to a clinical scenario, a foundational skill for determining the urgency and intensity of subsequent interventions [@problem_id:5093931].", "problem": "A previously healthy child is admitted with hypovolemia that is promptly corrected. Baseline serum creatinine was $0.4$ mg/dL measured $3$ days prior during a routine visit. Over the next $36$ h in hospital, serum creatinine rises to $0.7$ mg/dL. Concurrently, recorded urine output averages $0.4$ mL/kg/h over a continuous $10$ h interval, after which it returns to $0.5$ mL/kg/h. No renal replacement therapy is initiated, there is no anuria, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is not available. Using only foundational clinical definitions of acute kidney injury (AKI)—namely that AKI is an abrupt decline in kidney excretory function reflected by a rise in serum creatinine (a surrogate of glomerular filtration) and/or a reduction in urine output (a direct measure of kidney excretory flow)—determine the appropriate AKI stage in this child. Your answer must be justified on the basis of both the change in serum creatinine and the urine output pattern, including careful attention to relative versus absolute change and to the time windows over which these changes occur.\n\nWhich option most accurately assigns the stage and gives a correct justification?\n\nA. No AKI: The absolute serum creatinine value remains below $1.0$ mg/dL and oliguria lasted less than $12$ h, so criteria for AKI are not met.\n\nB. AKI Stage $1$: The serum creatinine increased by at least $0.3$ mg/dL within $48$ h and to between $1.5$ and $1.9$ times baseline; urine output was below $0.5$ mL/kg/h for between $6$ and $12$ h.\n\nC.

It uses standard, measurable biomarkers (serum creatinine, urine output) and asks for the application of widely accepted diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury (AKI). The values provided ($0.4$ mg/dL for baseline SCr in a child, a rise to $0.7$ mg/dL, and transient oliguria) are clinically realistic for a case of pre-renal AKI due to hypovolemia.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides specific numerical data and timeframes and asks for a classification based on standard definitions. The foundational definitions of AKI, such as the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, provide a clear, algorithmic framework for arriving at a unique solution.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, clinical language, free of ambiguity or subjective interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective clinical reasoning problem. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe determination of the Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) stage will be based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global outcomes (KDIGO) consensus criteria, which are the current global standard and represent the \"foundational clinical definitions\" mentioned in the problem. AKI is staged based on the most severe criterion met, using either serum creatinine (SCr) or urine output (UO).\n\nThe KDIGO staging criteria are as follows:\n-   **Stage 1**:\n    -   SCr: Increase $\\ge 0.3$ mg/dL within $48$ hours, OR\n    -   SCr: Increase to $1.5 - 1.9$ times baseline.\n    -   UO: $ 0.5$ mL/kg/h for $6 - 12$ hours.\n-   **Stage 2**:\n    -   SCr: Increase to $2.0 - 2.9$ times baseline.\n    -   UO: $ 0.5$ mL/kg/h for $\\ge 12$ hours.\n-   **Stage 3**:\n    -   SCr: Increase to $\\ge 3.0$ times baseline, OR\n    -   SCr: Increase to $\\ge 4.0$ mg/dL, OR\n    -   Initiation of Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT).\n    -   In children, a decrease in eGFR to $ 35$ mL/min per $1.73$ m$^2$.\n    -   UO: $ 0.3$ mL/kg/h for $\\ge 24$ hours, OR\n    -   UO: Anuria for $\\ge 12$ hours.\n\nWe will now analyze the patient's data against these criteria.\n\n**1. Analysis of Serum Creatinine (SCr) Change:**\n-   The baseline SCr is $\\text{SCr}_{\\text{baseline}} = 0.4$ mg/dL.\n-   The peak SCr is $\\text{SCr}_{\\text{peak}} = 0.7$ mg/dL.\n-   The timeframe for this rise is $36$ hours.\n\n-   **Absolute Increase Criterion**: The absolute increase in SCr is:\n    $$ \\Delta \\text{SCr} = \\text{SCr}_{\\text{peak}} - \\text{SCr}_{\\text{baseline}} = 0.7 \\, \\text{mg/dL} - 0.4 \\, \\text{mg/dL} = 0.3 \\, \\text{mg/dL} $$\n    This increase of $0.3$ mg/dL occurred over $36$ hours, which is within the $48$-hour window for the Stage $1$ criterion. Thus, the patient meets the absolute SCr criterion for **Stage 1 AKI**.\n\n-   **Relative Increase Criterion**: The relative increase in SCr is the ratio of peak SCr to baseline SCr:\n    $$ \\frac{\\text{SCr}_{\\text{peak}}}{\\text{SCr}_{\\text{baseline}}} = \\frac{0.7 \\, \\text{mg/dL}}{0.4 \\, \\text{mg/dL}} = 1.75 $$\n    A multiplier of $1.75$ falls in the range of $1.5 - 1.9$ times baseline. This meets the relative SCr criterion for **Stage 1 AKI**.\n\n-   The patient does not meet SCr criteria for higher stages. The multiplier is $1.75$, which is less than the $\\ge 2.0$ required for Stage $2$. The absolute SCr is $ 4.0$ mg/dL, the multiplier is less than $3.0$, and no RRT was initiated, so Stage $3$ criteria are not met.\n\n**2. Analysis of Urine Output (UO) Change:**\n-   The recorded UO was $0.4$ mL/kg/h. This value is less than the threshold of $0.5$ mL/kg/h.\n-   The duration of this reduced UO was $10$ hours.\n\n-   The KDIGO criterion for **Stage 1 AKI** is UO $ 0.5$ mL/kg/h for a duration of $6 - 12$ hours. This patient's UO of $0.4$ mL/kg/h for $10$ hours fits perfectly within this definition.\n\n-   The patient does not meet UO criteria for higher stages. Stage $2$ requires the oliguria (UO $ 0.5$ mL/kg/h) to last for $\\ge 12$ hours, but it only lasted for $10$ hours. Stage $3$ requires more severe oliguria (UO $ 0.3$ mL/kg/h) or anuria, neither of which occurred.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe patient meets the criteria for Stage $1$ AKI based on both serum creatinine (absolute and relative increase) and urine output. Since the highest stage met by any criterion is Stage $1$, the child is diagnosed with **Stage 1 AKI**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. No AKI: The absolute serum creatinine value remains below $1.0$ mg/dL and oliguria lasted less than $12$ h, so criteria for AKI are not met.**\nThis assertion is flawed. AKI diagnosis is not predicated on an absolute SCr threshold (e.g., $1.0$ mg/dL) but on the magnitude and rate of its *change*. The patient's SCr increased by $0.3$ mg/dL within $48$ h, meeting a core diagnostic criterion. Furthermore, oliguria (UO $ 0.5$ mL/kg/h) for $6 - 12$ hours is a criterion for Stage $1$ AKI, which was met. The statement that criteria are not met is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. AKI Stage $1$: The serum creatinine increased by at least $0.3$ mg/dL within $48$ h and to between $1.5$ and $1.9$ times baseline; urine output was below $0.5$ mL/kg/h for between $6$ and $12$ h.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the stage as Stage $1$. The justification provided is a precise and accurate summary of the patient's data mapped to the KDIGO criteria. The SCr increased by exactly $0.3$ mg/dL over $36$ h. The relative increase was $1.75$ times baseline, which is between $1.5$ and $1.9$. The UO was $0.4$ mL/kg/h ($ 0.5$ mL/kg/h) for $10$ h, which is between $6$ and $12$ h. The conclusion and the justification are both entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. AKI Stage $2$: The serum creatinine increased by at least $50\\%$ from baseline and there was oliguria; therefore, this meets Stage $2$.**\nThe SCr did increase by $75\\%$ (which is \"by at least $50\\%$), and there was oliguria. However, these findings define Stage $1$ AKI, not Stage $2$. Stage $2$ requires an SCr increase to $2.0 - 2.9$ times baseline (a $100\\% - 199\\%$ increase) or oliguria for $\\ge 12$ hours. The patient's data ($1.75$x baseline SCr, oliguria for $10$ h) do not meet the criteria for Stage $2$. The option misrepresents the staging definitions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. AKI Stage $3$: Any rise in serum creatinine of at least $0.3$ mg/dL combined with urine output below $0.5$ mL/kg/h constitutes Stage $3$.**\nThis statement is a complete misrepresentation of the staging system. A SCr rise of $\\ge 0.3$ mg/dL and a UO $ 0.5$ mL/kg/h (for $6-12$ h) are individual criteria for Stage $1$. Combining two criteria for Stage $1$ does not escalate the diagnosis to Stage $3$. Stage $3$ has significantly more severe and distinct criteria, as detailed above.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Cannot be staged: Without eGFR or the child’s height, there are insufficient data to assign an AKI stage.**\nThis is incorrect. The KDIGO guidelines are explicitly designed to allow for staging using SCr criteria *or* UO criteria. The availability of both SCr (with a known baseline) and UO (in mL/kg/h) is sufficient for a definitive diagnosis and staging. eGFR is an alternative criterion for Stage $3$ in children, but its absence does not preclude staging when other criteria are met. Height is only required for calculating body surface area to estimate GFR, which is not necessary here.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5093931"}, {"introduction": "Once AKI is staged, the clinician's focus shifts to diagnosis: is the injury due to decreased renal perfusion (prerenal), direct kidney damage (intrinsic), or a blockage (postrenal)? Answering this question requires a systematic approach that integrates various diagnostic tests. This exercise asks you to evaluate and select the most logical and robust diagnostic algorithm, forcing you to weigh the specificity of different tests and account for common confounders like diuretic use and patient age, mirroring the complex reasoning required in clinical practice [@problem_id:5093842].", "problem": "A pediatric unit wants to standardize the initial diagnostic approach to acute kidney injury (AKI) in children by integrating fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa), fractional excretion of urea nitrogen (FeUrea), urine osmolality, and urine sediment microscopy. The goal is to distinguish prerenal azotemia, intrinsic renal causes including acute tubular necrosis (ATN), glomerulonephritis, and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), and postrenal obstruction, in a manner robust to common confounders. The algorithm must: prioritize data with the highest immediate diagnostic specificity, account for loop diuretic exposure and neonatal tubular immaturity, and use physiologically justified thresholds for electrolyte handling and concentrating ability. Acronyms on first use: fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa), fractional excretion of urea nitrogen (FeUrea), acute tubular necrosis (ATN), acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC).\n\nWhich option best describes a stepwise algorithm that meets these criteria?\n\nA. Begin with urine sediment microscopy to identify diagnostic casts or cells: dysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts suggest glomerulonephritis; WBC casts or eosinophils suggest AIN; muddy brown granular casts suggest ATN; abundant crystals with suggestive history can indicate obstructive crystalluria; a bland or hyaline cast–predominant sediment keeps prerenal versus early ATN in play. Concurrently, if oliguria or anuria is present or history suggests obstruction, rule out postrenal obstruction with bedside bladder scan and renal ultrasonography. If sediment is nondiagnostic and obstruction is excluded, then evaluate renal handling: in children not exposed to loop diuretics in the previous $24$ to $48$ hours and beyond the neonatal period, use FeNa and urine osmolality together, where FeNa $1\\%$ with urine osmolality $500$ to $600$ mOsm/kg favors prerenal physiology, and FeNa $2\\%$ with urine osmolality $350$ mOsm/kg favors ATN; intermediate values prompt reassessment after volume optimization. If loop diuretics were given recently or the patient is a neonate, prioritize FeUrea (FeUrea $35\\%$ prerenal, FeUrea $50\\%$ intrinsic) over FeNa, and interpret neonatal FeNa cautiously because immature tubules can yield FeNa up to approximately $2$ to $3\\%$ even in prerenal states.

A solution can be derived by evaluating the options against established principles of pediatric nephrology.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Option Analysis\nA robust diagnostic algorithm for AKI must be structured logically, prioritizing tests that offer high specificity and can rapidly identify or exclude specific etiologies, while correctly handling common confounders.\n\n1.  **Initial Steps**: The first priorities should be to identify conditions that are emergent or have highly specific diagnostic markers.\n    - **Postrenal Obstruction**: This is a rapidly reversible cause of AKI. Clinical signs like anuria or a palpable bladder warrant immediate investigation with a bladder scan and renal ultrasonography. This should be a very early step.\n    - **Urine Sediment Microscopy**: This test can be pathognomonic. Red blood cell (RBC) casts point strongly to glomerulonephritis. White blood cell (WBC) casts point to tubulointerstitial inflammation (like pyelonephritis or AIN). Muddy brown granular casts are highly specific for ATN. The high diagnostic yield of these findings means sediment analysis should be performed early.\n\n2.  **Differentiating Prerenal vs. Intrinsic (ATN)**: If obstruction is ruled out and the sediment is non-diagnostic (e.g., bland sediment, hyaline casts), the next step is to assess tubular function. This is where FeNa, FeUrea, and osmolality are used.\n\n3.  **Handling Confounders (Diuretics and Age)**: The interpretation of these indices is highly dependent on clinical context.\n    - **Loop Diuretics**: These drugs block sodium reabsorption in the loop of Henle, artificially elevating FeNa. They also impair urinary concentration. Therefore, in a patient exposed to loop diuretics, FeNa and urine osmolality are unreliable for diagnosing a prerenal state. Fractional excretion of urea (FeUrea) is the preferred test, as urea handling is less affected by these diuretics.\n    - **Neonatal Physiology**: Neonates, particularly premature infants, have physiologically immature renal tubules. This leads to a reduced ability to reabsorb sodium and concentrate urine, even when hypovolemic. As a result, a \"prerenal\" neonate might have an FeNa of $2\\%-3\\%$, a value that would suggest ATN in an older child. FeUrea is therefore also preferred in this population.\n\n4.  **Physiologically Justified Thresholds**:\n    - For an older child without diuretic exposure:\n        - Prerenal: $\\text{FeNa}  1\\%$ and Urine Osmolality $ 500 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$.\n        - Intrinsic (ATN): $\\text{FeNa}  2\\%$ and Urine Osmolality $ 350 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$.\n    - With diuretic exposure or in neonates:\n        - Prerenal: $\\text{FeUrea}  35\\%$.\n        - Intrinsic (ATN): $\\text{FeUrea}  50\\%$.\n\nBased on these principles, let's evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Begin with urine sediment microscopy to identify diagnostic casts or cells: dysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts suggest glomerulonephritis; WBC casts or eosinophils suggest AIN; muddy brown granular casts suggest ATN; abundant crystals with suggestive history can indicate obstructive crystalluria; a bland or hyaline cast–predominant sediment keeps prerenal versus early ATN in play.

Integrate trends over time and the clinical context to reconcile discordant results.**\n\nThis option describes a comprehensive and correct algorithm.\n- It correctly prioritizes high-specificity tests first: urine microscopy and imaging for obstruction.\n- It correctly describes the pathognomonic findings on sediment.\n- It employs a logical secondary step (evaluating tubular function) for non-diagnostic initial findings.\n- It correctly identifies the standard context (no diuretics, older child) for using FeNa and urine osmolality, applying the correct, physiologically justified thresholds ($\\text{FeNa}  1\\%$, $\\text{U}_{\\text{osm}}  500 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$ for prerenal; $\\text{FeNa}  2\\%$, $\\text{U}_{\\text{osm}}  350 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$ for ATN).\n- It correctly identifies the specific situations (diuretic use, neonates) where FeNa is unreliable and FeUrea should be prioritized, using the correct thresholds ($\\text{FeUrea}  35\\%$ for prerenal).\n- It provides a correct physiological explanation for the cautious interpretation of FeNa in neonates.\n- It emphasizes the importance of clinical integration and trends.\nTherefore, this option meets all criteria specified in the problem statement.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**B. Start with FeNa in all children and classify as prerenal if FeNa $1\\%$ and intrinsic if FeNa $\\geq1\\%$. Use urine osmolality only if FeNa is between $1\\%$ and $2\\%$, and check sediment after these steps. Consider loop diuretics and age effects negligible for FeNa interpretation. Evaluate for obstruction only if anuria persists beyond $48$ hours.**\n\nThis option is incorrect for multiple reasons.\n- Starting with FeNa is not the optimal approach as it ignores the high immediate specificity of sediment and the need to rule out obstruction.\n- The cutoff of $\\text{FeNa} \\geq 1\\%$ for intrinsic AKI is an oversimplification and incorrect; values between $1\\%$ and $2\\%$ are typically considered indeterminate.\n- Stating that loop diuretic and age effects are \"negligible\" for FeNa interpretation is fundamentally wrong and clinically dangerous. This directly contravenes the problem requirements.\n- Delaying evaluation for obstruction for $48$ hours is inappropriate and can lead to irreversible kidney damage.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**C. Use urine osmolality as the primary discriminator: osmolality $400$ mOsm/kg indicates prerenal azotemia, and osmolality $200$ mOsm/kg indicates intrinsic AKI. If osmolality is between $200$ and $400$ mOsm/kg, then measure FeUrea to decide. Sediment is supportive only and RBC casts are interpreted as prerenal due to hemoconcentration. Loop diuretics do not affect the interpretation of these indices.**\n\nThis option is incorrect and contains dangerous misinformation.\n- Urine osmolality is not the best primary discriminator due to confounders.\n- The stated thresholds ($400$ and $200 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$) are not standard; the typical prerenal threshold is higher ($500 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$) and the intrinsic threshold is higher as well ($350 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$).\n- Interpreting RBC casts as \"prerenal\" is a critical error; they are a hallmark of glomerulonephritis, an intrinsic renal disease.\n- The claim that loop diuretics do not affect osmolality is false. They directly impair the kidney's concentrating ability.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**D. Rely on FeUrea alone because it is universally reliable in pediatrics: FeUrea $50\\%$ defines prerenal azotemia and FeUrea $\\geq50\\%$ defines intrinsic AKI in all ages and medication exposures. Sediment and osmolality add little and should not be used in the initial algorithm. Postrenal obstruction can be excluded clinically without imaging.**\n\nThis option is incorrect and oversimplified.\n- No single test is \"universally reliable\". While FeUrea is valuable, it does not replace other key tests.\n- The prerenal cutoff for FeUrea is typically $35\\%$, not $50\\%$.\n- Dismissing sediment microscopy and imaging for obstruction is medically unsound. Sediment can provide a definitive diagnosis (e.g., glomerulonephritis), and imaging is essential to definitively rule out obstruction.\n- Claiming obstruction can be excluded clinically without imaging is unsafe.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**E. First, check urine sediment for casts, then use FeNa with a universal prerenal cutoff at FeNa $2\\%$ and intrinsic if FeNa $\\geq2\\%$ regardless of diuretic exposure or age. Urine osmolality is considered only if FeNa is indeterminate. FeUrea is reserved for rare cases because it is not affected by liver disease or malnutrition and is less useful than FeNa in children.**\n\nThis option is incorrect.\n- While starting with sediment is reasonable, the subsequent steps are flawed.\n- Using a universal cutoff of $\\text{FeNa}  2\\%$ for prerenal is incorrect; the standard cutoff is $1\\%$. Using a $2\\%$ threshold would misclassify many cases of ATN as prerenal.\n- Ignoring diuretic exposure and age is a critical error that violates the problem's explicit requirements.\n- The characterization of FeUrea is misleading.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation governs the relationship between pH, bicarbonate concentration $([\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}])$, and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide $(\\mathrm{PaCO}_{2})$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{pK}_{a} + \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{\\alpha \\cdot \\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{pK}_{a}$ is the acid dissociation constant for the carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer system (approximately $6.1$) and $\\alpha$ is the solubility coefficient of $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in plasma (approximately $0.03 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L/mmHg}$).\n\nA primary metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary decrease in serum $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]$, which leads to a decrease in the $\\frac{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{\\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}}$ ratio and thus a decrease in pH (acidemia). The patient's laboratory values show a pH of $7.21$ (normal range $\\approx 7.35-7.45$) and a serum $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]$ of $12 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$ (normal range $\\approx 22-26 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$). The low pH and low bicarbonate concentration confirm the presence of a metabolic acidosis.\n\nTo determine if this is the primary disorder, we must assess the degree of respiratory compensation. In a primary metabolic acidosis, the body compensates by increasing ventilation to \"blow off\" $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, thereby lowering $\\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$. The expected compensatory response can be estimated using Winter's formula:\n$$\n\\text{Expected } \\mathrm{PaCO}_{2} = (1.5 \\times [\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]) + 8 \\pm 2\n$$\nUsing the patient's bicarbonate level of $12 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$:\n$$\n\\text{Expected } \\mathrm{PaCO}_{2} = (1.5 \\times 12) + 8 = 18 + 8 = 26 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}\n$$\nThe expected range for $\\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ is therefore $26 \\pm 2$, or $24-28 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. The patient's measured $\\mathrm{PaCO}_{2}$ is $28 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$, which falls within the range of appropriate respiratory compensation for a primary metabolic acidosis. This confirms that the acid-base disturbance is indeed a primary metabolic process.\n\nNext, we calculate the serum Anion Gap (AG). The principle of electroneutrality dictates that the total concentration of positive charges (cations) in the plasma must equal the total concentration of negative charges (anions). The AG is a calculated value representing the concentration of unmeasured anions. The standard clinical formula for the AG is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{AG} = [\\mathrm{Na}^{+}] - ([\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}] + [\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}])\n$$\nwhere $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]$ is the serum sodium concentration, $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]$ is the serum chloride concentration, and $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]$ is the serum bicarbonate concentration. The problem explicitly states to use this standard definition and not to correct for albumin.\n\nThe given values are:\n$[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}] = 138 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n$[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}] = 104 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n$[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}] = 12 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the AG formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{AG} = 138 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} - (104 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} + 12 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L})\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{AG} = 138 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} - 116 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{AG} = 22 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $22$, which becomes $22.0$ when expressed with three significant figures.\n\nFinally, we interpret the result. A normal AG is typically in the range of $8-12 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$. The calculated AG of $22.0 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$ is significantly elevated. This indicates a high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA). This is physiologically consistent with the clinical picture of AKI, where the kidneys fail to excrete metabolic acids (such as sulfates, phosphates, and urates), and with potential tissue hypoperfusion leading to lactic acidosis (the given lactate is elevated at $4.1 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$). These unmeasured anions accumulate in the plasma, increasing the AG. This contrasts with a normal-gap acidosis, where bicarbonate loss is primarily offset by an increase in chloride, keeping the AG normal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{22.0}$$", "id": "5093926"}]}
