Assume this population satisfies the conditions of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), namely random mating, large population size, negligible migration, mutation and selection at birth, and allele frequencies that sum to one. Let $p$ denote the frequency of the normal allele and $q$ denote the frequency of the mutant allele, with $p+q=1$. Under HWE, genotype frequencies are $p^{2}$ (homozygous normal), $2pq$ (heterozygous carriers), and $q^{2}$ (homozygous affected).\n\nPart 1: Using only the foundational definitions of HWE, derive an expression for the carrier frequency $2pq$ in terms of $q$ and compute its value given $q^{2} = \\frac{1}{40{,}000}$.\n\nPart 2: Consider a consanguineous union between first cousins from the same population.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of population genetics, specifically Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and the concept of inbreeding. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and definitions ($q^2 = \\frac{1}{40{,}000}$, $F = \\frac{1}{16}$) to arrive at a unique solution. The language is objective and the parameters are realistic.\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested. Let $p$ be the frequency of the normal allele and $q$ be the frequency of the mutant allele for the specified autosomal recessive Lysosomal Storage Disease (LSD).\n\n**Part 1: Carrier Frequency in the General Population**\n\nThe problem states that the population satisfies the conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A foundational principle of HWE is that the sum of allele frequencies at a biallelic locus is unity.\n$$p + q = 1$$\nThe birth prevalence of the disease, which corresponds to the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype ($aa$), is given as $q^2$.\n$$q^2 = \\frac{1}{40{,}000}$$\nFrom this, we can calculate the frequency of the mutant allele, $q$:\n$$q = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{40{,}000}} = \\frac{1}{200} = 0.005$$\nThe frequency of the normal allele, $p$, is then:\n$$p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995$$\nThe carrier frequency is the frequency of the heterozygous genotype ($Aa$), which is given by $2pq$ under HWE. The problem asks for an expression for $2pq$ in terms of $q$. We use the relation $p = 1 - q$:\n$$2pq = 2(1-q)q = 2q - 2q^2$$\nThis is the derived expression for the carrier frequency in terms of $q$.\nWe now compute the numerical value of the carrier frequency:\n$$2pq = 2(0.995)(0.005) = 0.00995$$\n\n**Part 2: Risk of Affected Offspring in a First-Cousin Union**\n\nWe are asked to derive the probability that a child of first cousins is affected by the LSD. The genetic relationship between the parents is quantified by the inbreeding coefficient, $F$, which is the probability that the two alleles at a given locus in their offspring are identical by descent (IBD). For the offspring of first cousins, $F = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nThe probability of an individual having the affected genotype ($aa$) can be determined by considering two mutually exclusive events:\n$1$. The two alleles at the locus are identical by descent. The probability of this event is $F$. If the alleles are IBD, the child will be homozygous $aa$ if the single ancestral allele they both descend from was the mutant allele '$a$'. The probability of this is the frequency of the '$a$' allele in the population, which is $q$. Therefore, the probability of being $aa$ through this path is $F \\times q$.\n\n$2$. The two alleles at the locus are not identical by descent. The probability of this event is $1-F$. If the alleles are not IBD, they are independent draws from the population's gene pool. The probability of drawing two '$a$' alleles independently is $q \\times q = q^2$. Therefore, the probability of being $aa$ through this path is $(1-F) \\times q^2$.\n\nThe total probability of the offspring being affected, $P(aa)$, is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n$$P(aa) = (F \\times q) + ((1-F) \\times q^2)$$\nThis is the derived probability. To express it in the common form involving $p, q, F$, we can algebraically rearrange the expression:\n$$P(aa) = Fq + q^2 - Fq^2 = q^2 + F(q - q^2) = q^2 + Fq(1-q)$$\nSince $p = 1 - q$, we obtain the standard formula for the frequency of a recessive homozygote with inbreeding:\n$$P(aa) = q^2 + Fpq$$\nWe now evaluate this probability numerically using the given and calculated values: $F = \\frac{1}{16} = 0.0625$, $q = 0.005$, and $p = 0.995$.\n$$P(aa) = (0.005)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right)(0.995)(0.005)$$\n$$P(aa) = 0.000025 + (0.0625)(0.004975)$$\n$$P(aa) = 0.000025 + 0.0003109375$$\n$$P(aa) = 0.0003359375$$\n\n**Final Results and Rounding**\n\nThe problem requires the two results reported as decimal numbers rounded to four significant figures.\n\nValue 1: Carrier frequency, $2pq = 0.00995$. To four significant figures, this is $0.009950$.\n\nValue 2: Risk for first-cousin offspring, $P(aa) = 0.0003359375$.

It presents a standard application of Bayes' theorem to medical diagnostics, providing all necessary data for a unique solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the formula for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and then calculate its numerical value for the given parameters. The PPV is the probability that an individual has the disease given that they test positive, denoted as $P(D \\mid T^+)$.\n\nLet us define the events:\n$D$: The event that an infant has Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I).\n$D^c$: The event that an infant does not have MPS I.\n$T^+$: The event that the screening test result is positive.\n$T^-$: The event that the screening test result is negative.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are translated into probabilistic terms:\n1.  The prevalence of the disease: $P(D) = \\frac{1}{10{,}000} = 0.0001$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test: This is the probability of a positive test result given that the infant has the disease. $P(T^+ \\mid D) = 0.95$.\n3.  The specificity of the test: This is the probability of a negative test result given that the infant does not have the disease. $P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 0.99$.\n\nThe quantity we seek to derive is the PPV, which is the conditional probability $P(D \\mid T^+)$.

It presents a straightforward calculation based on clear definitions and data relevant to pediatric pharmacology.\n\nThe task is to calculate the total amount of enzyme administered to an infant over an $8$-week period. The solution can be determined by first calculating the dose for a single administration and then determining the total number of administrations that occur within the specified time frame.\n\nFirst, let's establish the given parameters from the problem statement:\n-   The weight-based maintenance dose is $D_{w} = 20$ mg of enzyme per kg of body mass.\n-   The infant's body mass is $m = 5$ kg, which is assumed to be constant.\n-   The therapy is administered every other week, which corresponds to a dosing interval of $\\Delta t = 2$ weeks.\n-   The therapy begins at week $t_0 = 0$.\n-   The observation window is $8$ weeks, starting from week $0$. A critical condition is that \"any dose that would fall exactly at week $8$ is not included in the $8$-week total.\" This defines the time interval of interest as $[0, 8)$.\n\nThe amount of enzyme for a single administration, denoted as $A$, is calculated by multiplying the weight-based dose by the infant's body mass:\n$$A = D_{w} \\times m$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$A = \\left(20 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}}\\right) \\times (5 \\text{kg}) = 100 \\text{ mg}$$\nSo, $100$ mg of the enzyme is administered at each dosing event.\n\nNext, we must determine the number of dosing events, $N$, that occur within the specified $8$-week window. The administrations are scheduled every $2$ weeks, starting at week $0$. The times of administration, $t_k$, can be expressed by the formula $t_k = 0 + k \\cdot \\Delta t = 2k$, where $k$ is a non-negative integer representing the dose number (with $k=0$ being the first dose).\n\nWe need to find all values of $t_k$ such that $0 \\le t_k < 8$. Let's list the administration times:\n-   For $k=0$: $t_0 = 2 \\times 0 = 0$ weeks. This time is in the interval $[0, 8)$.\n-   For $k=1$: $t_1 = 2 \\times 1 = 2$ weeks.
