It presents a standard application of statistical principles to a realistic clinical scenario in pediatrics. All necessary data for the calculation are provided.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the $z$-score for a given measurement. The $z$-score, or standard score, quantifies the number of standard deviations a data point $x$ is from the mean $\\mu$ of its distribution. The formula for the $z$-score is derived from the process of standardization.\n\nLet $X$ be a random variable representing the stretched penile length, which is assumed to be normally distributed with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$. The problem provides the following parameters for the reference population of term newborns:\n- Mean: $\\mu = 3.5 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$\n- Standard deviation: $\\sigma = 0.4 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$\n\nThe specific measurement to be evaluated is:\n- Observed value: $x = 2.0 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$\n\nThe formula to convert an observed value $x$ into a $z$-score is given by:\n$$ z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} $$\nThis formula effectively rescales the deviation of the data point from the mean, $(x - \\mu)$, in units of the standard deviation, $\\sigma$. The resulting $z$-score is a dimensionless quantity, as the units in the numerator and denominator cancel out.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$ z = \\frac{2.0 \\ \\mathrm{cm} - 3.5 \\ \\mathrm{cm}}{0.4 \\ \\mathrm{cm}} $$\nFirst, we calculate the deviation from the mean in the numerator:\n$$ x - \\mu = 2.0 - 3.5 = -1.5 $$\nThe negative sign indicates that the measured value is below the population mean.\n\nNext, we divide this deviation by the standard deviation:\n$$ z = \\frac{-1.5}{0.4} $$\nTo perform the division, we can express the numbers as fractions or multiply the numerator and denominator by $10$ to remove the decimals:\n$$ z = \\frac{-1.5 \\times 10}{0.4 \\times 10} = \\frac{-15}{4} $$\nPerforming the final division:\n$$ z = -3.75 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value, $-3.75$, has exactly three significant figures (the digits $3$, $7$, and $5$). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe calculated $z$-score of $-3.75$ means that the measured stretched penile length of $2.0 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$ is $3.75$ standard deviations below the mean for term newborns.

The description of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis response to hCG, the enzymatic conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone by 5α-reductase, and the use of the testosterone/dihydrotestosterone ratio as a diagnostic aid for 5α-reductase deficiency are all well-established principles in pediatric endocrinology.

A unique solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in objective, scientific language.\n- **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The problem is complete and self-consistent. The units ($ \\text{ng/mL} $) are consistent for both measurements, ensuring they cancel out to produce a dimensionless ratio as expected.\n- **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The scenario and data are realistic within a clinical context.\n- **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured:** The problem is clearly structured and unambiguous.\n- **Conclusion:** The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the post-stimulation testosterone-to-dihydrotestosterone ratio, denoted by $R$. The given values are:\n- The concentration of testosterone, $[\\text{testosterone}] = 6.0\\ \\text{ng/mL}$.\n- The concentration of dihydrotestosterone, $[\\text{dihydrotestosterone}] = 0.08\\ \\text{ng/mL}$.\n\nThe ratio $R$ is defined as:\n$$R = \\frac{[\\text{testosterone}]}{[\\text{dihydrotestosterone}]}$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into the equation:\n$$R = \\frac{6.0\\ \\text{ng/mL}}{0.08\\ \\text{ng/mL}}$$\n\nThe units of concentration, $\\text{ng/mL}$, cancel out, yielding a dimensionless quantity as required. The calculation is:\n$$R = \\frac{6.0}{0.08} = \\frac{600}{8} = 75$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed with two significant figures. The calculated value, $75$, is composed of the digits $7$ and $5$, which are both significant. Thus, the number $75$ is already expressed with two significant figures. No further rounding is needed.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a brief clinical interpretation. The problem states that post-hCG stimulation ratios greater than about $20$ to $30$ are supportive of a diagnosis of 5α-reductase deficiency. The calculated ratio is $R=75$. Since $75$ is significantly greater than the threshold range of $20$ to $30$, the result strongly supports the clinical suspicion of 5α-reductase deficiency in this neonate.
