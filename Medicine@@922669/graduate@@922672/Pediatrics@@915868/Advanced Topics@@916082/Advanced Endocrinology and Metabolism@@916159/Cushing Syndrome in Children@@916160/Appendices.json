The problem provides the following data:\n- Measured UFC concentration, $C_{UFC} = 58.0~\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{L}$.\n- Total $24$-hour urine volume, $V = 1.20~\\mathrm{L}$.\n- Child's body surface area, $A_{BSA} = 0.95~\\mathrm{m}^{2}$.\n- Age-adjusted upper reference limit, $U_{URL} = 65.0~\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{24}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n\nThe calculation proceeds in three steps as outlined by the first principles mentioned in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total mass of UFC, denoted as $m_{UFC}$, excreted over the $24$-hour collection period.

The resulting units, $\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{24}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, signify the mass in micrograms per square meter of body surface area over a $24$-hour period.\n$$UFC_{norm} = \\frac{m_{UFC}}{A_{BSA}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated mass and the given BSA:\n$$UFC_{norm} = \\frac{69.6~\\mu\\mathrm{g}}{0.95~\\mathrm{m}^2} \\quad (\\text{per } 24 \\text{ hours})$$\n$$UFC_{norm} \\approx 73.263157...~\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{24}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\nThis is the intermediate value for the BSA-normalized UFC.\n\nThird, we compute the exceedance ratio $R$, which is defined as the patient's normalized UFC value divided by the laboratory's age-adjusted upper reference limit, $U_{URL}$.\n$$R = \\frac{UFC_{norm}}{U_{URL}}$$\nThe units are consistent and will cancel, resulting in a dimensionless ratio as required.\n$$R = \\frac{73.263157...~\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{24}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}}{65.0~\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{24}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}}$$\n$$R \\approx 1.1271255...$$\n\nFinally, the problem requires reporting $R$ rounded to $3$ significant figures. The fourth significant digit is $7$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the third significant digit.\n$$R \\approx 1.13$$\nThis value indicates that the child's normalized UFC excretion is approximately $13\\%$ above the upper reference limit for their age group.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.13}$$", "id": "5130039"}, {"introduction": "Once hypercortisolism is confirmed, the diagnostic journey shifts to identifying its source.

Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) drives pituitary ACTH secretion.\n    2.  ACTH stimulates the adrenal zona fasciculata (cortisol) and zona reticularis (adrenal androgens, e.g., DHEA-S).\n    3.  Cortisol exerts negative feedback on both CRH and ACTH secretion.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n-   **Scientific Groundedness:** The problem statement is scientifically sound. The clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory values are classic for Cushing syndrome in childhood. The described physiology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is correct. The interpretation of laboratory and imaging findings is consistent with established medical principles and diagnostic algorithms for hypercortisolism.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient, internally consistent data to allow for a differential diagnosis and to determine the most likely etiology and appropriate next steps. A unique and meaningful conclusion can be drawn by integrating the provided information.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, clinical terms, free from subjective language or bias.\n\nThe problem statement is internally consistent:\n1.  The multiple positive screening tests (elevated morning cortisol, midnight salivary cortisol, and $24$-hour UFC) confirm the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome.\n2.  The suppressed plasma ACTH level ($<5\\ \\text{pg/mL}$) correctly localizes the source of hypercortisolism to the adrenal glands (ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome).\n3.  The normal pituitary MRI is consistent with a primary adrenal pathology causing suppression of the pituitary corticotrophs.\n4.  The abdominal CT reveals a large adrenal mass, providing a clear anatomical correlate for the ACTH-independent cortisol production.\n5.  The combination of features—excess cortisol (Cushing's signs), excess androgens (accelerated pubic hair, elevated DHEA-S), large tumor size ($5.6\\ \\text{cm}$), and suspicious imaging characteristics (irregular margins, heterogeneity)—is a classic presentation for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). Benign adenomas are typically smaller and produce only cortisol, leading to *suppressed* DHEA-S due to ACTH suppression. The co-secretion of cortisol and androgens strongly points to a malignant process.\n\nThe problem is a standard clinical vignette that tests the application of endocrinological principles to a diagnostic puzzle. No flaws are identified.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n---\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe fundamental task is to determine the etiology of this child's Cushing syndrome by integrating the clinical, biochemical, and imaging data with the provided principles of HPA axis physiology, and then to identify the appropriate next step in management.\n\n1.  **Establishing the Diagnosis of Cushing Syndrome:** The patient presents with classic clinical features of cortisol excess, including central adiposity, facial rounding, violaceous striae, and hypertension. A key sign in children is growth deceleration, which is present (height velocity $<3\\ \\text{cm/year}$). The diagnosis is biochemically confirmed by demonstrating pathologically elevated cortisol levels that lack normal diurnal rhythm: elevated morning serum cortisol ($28\\ \\mu\\text{g/dL}$), loss of the nadir with elevated midnight salivary cortisol ($0.45\\ \\mu\\text{g/dL}$), and increased total $24$-hour production with elevated urinary free cortisol ($220\\ \\mu\\text{g}$).\n\n2.  **Determining the Etiology (ACTH-Dependent vs. ACTH-Independent):** The HPA axis functions via a negative feedback loop: high cortisol levels suppress pituitary ACTH secretion. The next step in evaluating Cushing syndrome is to measure plasma ACTH.\n    -   If ACTH is normal or elevated, the pathology is ACTH-dependent, originating from either the pituitary (Cushing disease) or an ectopic source.\n    -   If ACTH is suppressed, the pathology is ACTH-independent, originating from an adrenal tumor producing cortisol autonomously.\n    In this case, the plasma ACTH is suppressed ($<5\\ \\text{pg/mL}$). This unequivocally indicates an ACTH-independent etiology. The source of the excess cortisol is an adrenal tumor.\n\n3.  **Characterizing the Adrenal Pathology:**\n    -   **Imaging:** Abdominal CT reveals a $5.6\\ \\text{cm}$ left adrenal mass. Its features—large size ($>4\\ \\text{cm}$), irregular margins, and heterogeneous density—are highly suspicious for a malignant tumor, specifically an adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). The normal appearance of the contralateral (right) adrenal is expected, as it would be functionally suppressed and potentially atrophic due to the chronic lack of ACTH stimulation.\n    -   **Hormonal Profile:** The patient has signs of androgen excess (accelerated pubic hair, acne) and a markedly elevated serum DHEA-S ($700\\ \\mu\\text{g/dL}$). DHEA-S is an adrenal androgen whose production is normally stimulated by ACTH. In a state of ACTH suppression, DHEA-S levels would be expected to be low if the adrenal tumor were a benign adenoma producing only cortisol. The fact that DHEA-S is profoundly elevated indicates that the tumor itself is co-secreting both cortisol and adrenal androgens. This \"mixed\" hormonal secretion is a hallmark of ACC, particularly in children.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Diagnosis:** The most parsimonious diagnosis that integrates all findings is an ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome due to a cortisol- and androgen-secreting left adrenocortical carcinoma.\n\n5.  **Determining the Next Step in Management:** Given the high suspicion for ACC, an aggressive and rare malignancy, management must be meticulous.\n    -   **Staging:** Before any surgical intervention, comprehensive staging is mandatory to assess for local invasion and distant metastatic disease (commonly to the liver, lungs, and regional lymph nodes). This is typically achieved with high-resolution, contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, or equivalent MRI/PET imaging.\n    -   **Further Characterization:** Expanded urinary or serum steroid profiling can further support the diagnosis of ACC (by detecting high levels of steroid precursors) and provide tumor markers for future surveillance.\n    -   **Surgical Planning:** Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for localized ACC, but it must be performed with curative intent. This requires an *en-bloc* resection (removing the tumor with surrounding fat and kidney if involved, without violating the tumor capsule) by a surgeon experienced in adrenal and oncologic surgery. Such expertise is typically found at high-volume, tertiary referral centers. A multidisciplinary team (pediatric endocrinology, surgery, oncology, pathology) is essential for planning treatment.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. Pituitary corticotroph microadenoma (Cushing disease); next step: inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) to confirm a central ACTH source.**\nThis option proposes an ACTH-dependent cause. This is directly contradicted by the patient's suppressed plasma ACTH level ($<5\\ \\text{pg/mL}$). Cushing disease is defined by ACTH production from a pituitary adenoma, which would result in normal or high ACTH levels. Therefore, the diagnosis is incorrect, and the proposed next step (IPSS) is inappropriate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. ACTH-independent cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma; next step: proceed directly to unilateral adrenalectomy without additional staging.**\nThis option correctly identifies the process as ACTH-independent but incorrectly classifies the tumor as a benign adenoma and proposes an unsafe management plan. The tumor's size ($5.6\\ \\text{cm}$), imaging features (irregular, heterogeneous), and co-secretion of androgens (high DHEA-S) are all strongly suggestive of malignancy (ACC), not a benign adenoma. Proceeding to surgery without comprehensive staging for a suspected cancer would be a grave error, potentially compromising the chance for a cure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. ACTH-independent adrenocortical carcinoma with co-secretion of adrenal androgens; next step: comprehensive staging with contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging and expanded steroid profiling, followed by multidisciplinary surgical planning at a high-volume center.**\nThis option provides the most accurate and comprehensive synthesis of the data. The diagnosis of ACTH-independent ACC with androgen co-secretion correctly accounts for the suppressed ACTH, the large and suspicious adrenal mass, and the markedly elevated DHEA-S. The proposed next steps—comprehensive staging, further biochemical workup, and referral to a specialized multidisciplinary team for surgical planning—represent the standard of care for suspected ACC to maximize patient outcomes.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Ectopic ACTH secretion from an occult neuroendocrine tumor; next step: whole-body somatostatin receptor imaging with $^{68}$Ga-DOTATATE positron emission tomography to localize the source.**\nThis option proposes an ACTH-dependent cause. Similar to option A, this is definitively ruled out by the suppressed plasma ACTH level. Ectopic ACTH syndrome involves non-pituitary tumors producing ACTH, leading to elevated ACTH levels. The proposed diagnostic imaging is used to find such tumors but is irrelevant in an ACTH-suppressed state.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "5130240"}, {"introduction": "The definitive treatment for a cortisol-producing adrenal tumor is surgical resection, but this cure introduces a predictable and dangerous physiological challenge: acute adrenal insufficiency.
