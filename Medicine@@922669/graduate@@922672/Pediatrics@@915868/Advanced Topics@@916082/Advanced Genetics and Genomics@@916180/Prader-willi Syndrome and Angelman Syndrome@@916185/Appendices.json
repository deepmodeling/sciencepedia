The woman is heterozygous for a confirmed, fully penetrant loss-of-function variant in the Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene. The man is unaffected and has no UBE3A variant. Assume the following well-tested biological facts as the foundational base: (i) Mendelian segregation of autosomal alleles, where a heterozygous individual transmits each allele with probability $1/2$, (ii) genomic imprinting of UBE3A in central nervous system neurons such that the maternally inherited allele is expressed while the paternally inherited allele is transcriptionally silenced, and (iii) no germline mosaicism beyond heterozygosity, no de novo mutation, and complete penetrance for loss of maternal UBE3A function. Using these principles, compute the probability that their child will have AS. Additionally, justify, from these same principles, why paternal transmission of the same loss-of-function UBE3A variant does not cause AS.\n\nExpress the final risk for AS as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. No units are required.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. All necessary information and assumptions for its resolution are provided. Therefore, a validation of the problem confirms its validity, and a solution can be derived.\n\nLet us denote the functional, wild-type allele of the *UBE3A* gene as $U$ and the loss-of-function variant allele as $u$. The problem describes a scenario of genetic risk assessment based on Mendelian inheritance coupled with the non-Mendelian phenomenon of genomic imprinting.\n\nThe parental genotypes are defined as follows:\n- The woman is heterozygous for the *UBE3A* variant. Her genotype is $Uu$.\n- The man is unaffected and has no *UBE3A* variant. His genotype is $UU$.\n\nWe first compute the probability that their child will have Angelman syndrome (AS).\n\nAccording to the principle of Mendelian segregation (Assumption i), a heterozygous individual transmits each of their two alleles to an offspring with a probability of $1/2$.\n- The probability that the mother transmits the functional allele $U$ is $P(\\text{maternal allele is } U) = 1/2$.\n- The probability that the mother transmits the loss-of-function allele $u$ is $P(\\text{maternal allele is } u) = 1/2$.\n\nThe father has a genotype of $UU$. Therefore, he can only transmit the functional allele $U$.\n- The probability that the father transmits the functional allele $U$ is $P(\\text{paternal allele is } U) = 1$.\n\nWe can now determine the probabilities of the possible genotypes for their child by combining the probabilities of the alleles inherited from each parent:\n1.  The child inherits $U$ from the mother and $U$ from the father. The resulting genotype is $UU$. The probability of this event is $P(UU) = P(\\text{maternal allele is } U) \\times P(\\text{paternal allele is } U) = (1/2) \\times 1 = 1/2$.\n2.  The child inherits $u$ from the mother and $U$ from the father. The resulting genotype is $uU$. The probability of this event is $P(uU) = P(\\text{maternal allele is } u) \\times P(\\text{paternal allele is } U) = (1/2) \\times 1 = 1/2$.\n\nNext, we apply the principle of genomic imprinting (Assumption ii), which states that in the relevant central nervous system neurons, only the maternally inherited *UBE3A* allele is expressed, while the paternally inherited allele is transcriptionally silenced. The phenotype is thus determined exclusively by the functionality of the maternal allele.\n\nWe analyze the phenotype corresponding to each possible genotype:\n1.  For genotype $UU$: The maternally inherited allele is $U$, which is functional. This allele is expressed, leading to the production of functional UBE3A protein. The child will be unaffected.\n2.  For genotype $uU$: The maternally inherited allele is $u$, which is a loss-of-function variant. This allele, although it is the one designated for expression, cannot produce a functional protein. The paternally inherited allele is $U$, which is functional, but it is silenced due to imprinting and therefore not expressed. Consequently, there is no functional UBE3A protein in the child's neurons.\n\nThe problem states complete penetrance for the loss of maternal *UBE3A* function (Assumption iii). This means that if a child has the genetic makeup for AS (i.e., lacks a functional maternal *UBE3A* allele), the probability of exhibiting the syndrome is $1$.\n\nTherefore, the total probability of the child having AS is the probability of having the genotype $uU$ (with $u$ inherited from the mother) multiplied by the penetrance.\n$$P(\\text{AS}) = P(uU) \\times P(\\text{phenotype | genotype } uU) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nAs a decimal, this probability is $0.5$. The problem requires the answer to be expressed to four significant figures, which is $0.5000$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to justify, from the same principles, why paternal transmission of the same loss-of-function *UBE3A* variant does not cause AS.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we consider a hypothetical reciprocal cross where the father is heterozygous ($Uu$) and the mother is homozygous for the functional allele ($UU$).\n- The probability that the father transmits the loss-of-function allele $u$ is $P(\\text{paternal allele is } u) = 1/2$.\n- The mother can only transmit the functional allele $U$, so $P(\\text{maternal allele is } U) = 1$.\n\nA child from this couple could inherit the genotype $Uu$, where the maternal allele is $U$ and the paternal allele is $u$. The probability of this specific outcome is $P(\\text{maternal is } U) \\times P(\\text{paternal is } u) = 1 \\times (1/2) = 1/2$.\n\nAccording to the imprinting rule (Assumption ii), the maternal allele ($U$) is expressed, and the paternal allele ($u$) is silenced. Since the expressed maternal allele is functional, the child will produce normal UBE3A protein in their neurons and will be unaffected. This demonstrates that inheriting a loss-of-function *UBE3A* allele from the father does not cause AS, because the functionally critical maternal allele is normal and expressed, compensating for the silenced, non-functional paternal allele. The disease phenotype is contingent solely on the status of the maternally contributed allele.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5000}$$", "id": "5196147"}, {"introduction": "While many cases of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are sporadic, some families face a high recurrence risk due to inherited defects in the imprinting process itself. This practice explores such a scenario, involving a cryptic deletion in the imprinting center (IC) on the father's chromosome $15$. By working through this problem, you will apply your knowledge of how the IC governs parent-of-origin gene expression to determine the recurrence risk, a critical skill for counseling affected families [@problem_id:5196164].", "problem": "A father is clinically unaffected but is known to carry a cryptic heterozygous microdeletion at the imprinting center that governs the establishment and resetting of parent-of-origin methylation marks for the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) critical region on chromosome 15. In male gametogenesis, normal imprint resetting establishes a paternal pattern of methylation required for expression of paternally active genes; the microdeletion in this father prevents this resetting on the deleted allele, so any allele carrying this microdeletion that is transmitted via sperm retains a maternal-type imprint and is transcriptionally silent in the offspring. Assume the following foundational principles: (i) genomic imprinting is parent-of-origin specific and depends on methylation marks established during gametogenesis; (ii) PWS results from loss of expression of paternally expressed genes; (iii) for a heterozygous autosomal locus, Mendel’s law of segregation implies a transmission probability of $1/2$ for each allele to a gamete; and (iv) penetrance is complete for PWS when the defective paternally derived allele is present, and there are no de novo events or additional mechanisms contributing to risk.\n\nUnder these assumptions, derive from first principles the per-pregnancy recurrence risk that a future child of this father will be affected with PWS. Express your final answer as a decimal or a fraction, without a percentage sign. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for the per-pregnancy recurrence risk that a future child of a specific father will be affected with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). To solve this, we must first validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   A father is clinically unaffected.\n-   The father is heterozygous for a cryptic microdeletion at the imprinting center (IC) on chromosome $15$.\n-   The microdeletion prevents the resetting of the pre-existing maternal imprint to a paternal imprint during the father's gametogenesis.\n-   An allele carrying this microdeletion, if transmitted via sperm, retains a maternal-type imprint and is transcriptionally silent for the PWS-related genes in the offspring.\n-   Assumption (i): Genomic imprinting is parent-of-origin specific and depends on methylation marks established during gametogenesis.\n-   Assumption (ii): PWS results from the loss of expression of paternally expressed genes on chromosome $15$.\n-   Assumption (iii): For a heterozygous autosomal locus, Mendel’s law of segregation applies, meaning there is a transmission probability of $1/2$ for each allele to a gamete.\n-   Assumption (iv): Penetrance is complete for PWS when the defective paternal allele is present, and there are no de novo events or other contributing mechanisms.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing a known mechanism for a familial imprinting disorder. The premises are based on established principles of molecular genetics, specifically genomic imprinting and Mendelian inheritance. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and assumptions to calculate a unique probability. The language is objective and precise. The setup is internally consistent; the father's unaffected status is compatible with him having inherited the deleted allele from his mother (where it would be silenced anyway) and a functional allele from his father. Thus, the problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Solution\nLet us denote the two homologous chromosomes 15 in the father. Since he is heterozygous for the microdeletion at the imprinting center (IC), one chromosome carries the normal imprinting center, which we will label $IC^{+}$, and the other carries the deleted imprinting center, which we will label $IC^{del}$.\n\nAccording to Mendelian principles, specifically the law of segregation as stated in assumption (iii), during meiosis, the father will produce two populations of sperm in equal proportions.\n1.  Sperm carrying the chromosome with the normal imprinting center, $IC^{+}$. The probability of a single sperm belonging to this population is $P(IC^{+}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n2.  Sperm carrying the chromosome with the deleted imprinting center, $IC^{del}$. The probability of a single sperm belonging to this population is $P(IC^{del}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe now analyze the consequence of fertilization by each type of sperm, based on the provided rules of genomic imprinting. PWS occurs when a child lacks a functional, paternally expressed copy of the critical gene region on chromosome $15$. The maternally inherited chromosome $15$ is always imprinted such that these genes are silent. Therefore, the child's phenotype depends entirely on the status of the chromosome $15$ inherited from the father.\n\n**Case 1: Fertilization by a sperm carrying $IC^{+}$**\nThe chromosome with the $IC^{+}$ allele undergoes normal imprint resetting during spermatogenesis. A paternal methylation pattern is established, leading to the expression of the PWS-related genes. A child conceived from this sperm will inherit a functional, paternally expressed chromosome $15$. This child will be clinically unaffected, regardless of the mother's contribution (which is normally silent for these genes). The probability of this event is the probability of transmitting the $IC^{+}$ allele, which is $P(\\text{unaffected child}) = P(IC^{+}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n**Case 2: Fertilization by a sperm carrying $IC^{del}$**\nThe problem explicitly states that the microdeletion at the IC prevents the resetting of the imprint to the paternal pattern. The allele \"retains a maternal-type imprint and is transcriptionally silent in the offspring.\" This means that although the chromosome is inherited from the father, it carries a maternal methylation pattern, and the PWS-critical genes are not expressed.\nA child conceived from this sperm will therefore have:\n-   A paternally inherited chromosome $15$ that is transcriptionally silent for the PWS region (due to the $IC^{del}$ defect).\n-   A maternally inherited chromosome $15$ that is also transcriptionally silent for the PWS region (due to normal maternal imprinting).\n\nAs a result, the child will lack any functional, expressed copy of the PWS-critical genes. According to assumption (ii), this results in PWS. Assumption (iv) states that penetrance is complete, so this genetic state guarantees the disease phenotype. The probability of this event is the probability of transmitting the $IC^{del}$ allele, which is $P(\\text{affected child}) = P(IC^{del}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe per-pregnancy recurrence risk for PWS is the probability of having an affected child in any given pregnancy. Based on the analysis, this risk is equal to the probability of the father transmitting the chromosome with the deleted imprinting center, $IC^{del}$.\n\nTherefore, the recurrence risk is $\\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "5196164"}, {"introduction": "Moving from individual genetics to population health, this problem addresses the practical challenges of newborn screening for rare disorders like Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS).

The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe solution requires the derivation and calculation of the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of a diagnostic test. Let $D$ be the event that a newborn has Prader-Willi syndrome (the \"disease\"), and let $D^c$ be the event that the newborn does not have the syndrome. Let $T^+$ be the event that the screening test is positive, and $T^-$ be the event that the test is negative.\n\nThe given parameters can be expressed in terms of conditional probabilities:\n-   The prevalence, $P$, is the prior probability of having the disease: $P(D) = P = \\frac{1}{20000} = 0.00005$.\n-   The probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - P$.\n-   The sensitivity, $Se$, is the probability of a positive test result given that the person has the disease: $P(T^+ | D) = Se = 0.99$. This is the true positive rate.\n-   The specificity, $Sp$, is the probability of a negative test result given that the person does not have the disease: $P(T^- | D^c) = Sp = 0.995$. This is the true negative rate.\n\nFrom the definition of specificity, we can determine the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the person does not have the disease:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.995 = 0.005$$\n\nThe problem asks for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV). The PPV is defined as the probability that a newborn truly has the disease given a positive test result. In probabilistic notation, this is the posterior probability $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nWe use Bayes' theorem to calculate this posterior probability:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of receiving a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, summing over the two mutually exclusive states of having the disease or not having the disease:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se \\cdot P) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P))$$\nThis expression represents the sum of the proportion of true positives and the proportion of false positives in the entire population.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $P(T^+)$ back into the Bayes' theorem formula for PPV:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}$$\nIn terms of the given variable names, the symbolic formula for PPV is:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot P}{Se \\cdot P + (1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P)}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the positive predictive value.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n-   $P = 0.00005$\n-   $Se = 0.99$\n-   $Sp = 0.995$\n\nFirst, we calculate the terms in the formula:\n-   The numerator (proportion of true positives):\n    $Se \\cdot P = 0.99 \\times 0.00005 = 0.0000495$\n-   The probability of not having the disease:\n    $1 - P = 1 - 0.00005 = 0.99995$\n-   The false positive rate:\n    $1 - Sp = 1 - 0.995 = 0.005$\n-   The proportion of false positives:\n    $(1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P) = 0.005 \\times 0.99995 = 0.00499975$\n\nNow, we calculate the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$:\n$P(T^+) = 0.0000495 + 0.00499975 = 0.00504925$\n\nFinally, we compute the PPV:\n$PPV = \\frac{0.0000495}{0.00504925} \\approx 0.009803426...$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is the $9$ in the thousandths place. The four significant figures are $9$, $8$, $0$, and $3$. The fifth significant digit is $4$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we truncate at the fourth significant digit).\n$PPV \\approx 0.009803$\nThis result highlights a critical concept in medical screening: even with a highly sensitive and specific test, the positive predictive value can be very low when the prevalence of the disease is low.
