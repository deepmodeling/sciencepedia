Let $T$ be the event that the test result is positive, and $\\neg T$ be the event that the test result is negative.\n\nThe givens can be expressed in terms of conditional probabilities:\n- The prevalence, or pre-test probability of having the disease, is $P(D) = p = 0.01$.\n- The probability of not having the disease is therefore $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$.\n- The sensitivity is the probability of a positive test given the person has the disease: $S_e = P(T \\mid D) = 0.95$. This is the true positive rate.\n- The specificity is the probability of a negative test given the person does not have the disease: $S_p = P(\\neg T \\mid \\neg D) = 0.98$.\n- From specificity, we derive the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given the person does not have the disease: $P(T \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - P(\\neg T \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - S_p = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$.\n\nThe objective is to find the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which is the post-test probability of having the disease given a positive test result, defined as $PPV = P(D \\mid T)$.\n\nWe apply Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$ P(D \\mid T) = \\frac{P(T \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T)} $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, considering the two mutually exclusive scenarios in which a positive test can occur: a true positive (the person has the disease and tests positive) and a false positive (the person does not have the disease but tests positive).\n$$ P(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap \\neg D) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A \\mid B) P(B)$, we can write:\n$$ P(T) = P(T \\mid D) P(D) + P(T \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D) $$\n\nSubstituting this expanded form of $P(T)$ back into the Bayes' theorem expression for $PPV$:\n$$ PPV = P(D \\mid T) = \\frac{P(T \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T \\mid D) P(D) + P(T \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)} $$\n\nThis is the derived expression for PPV from first principles.

All terms are clearly defined, and sufficient data is provided to perform the required calculations. The problem is self-contained, internally consistent, and objective. It poses a question that can be answered rigorously using the provided framework. The problem is therefore valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of Solution\nThe core task is to compare the expected harms and benefits of different disclosure strategies using the principles of expected value and discounting to present value.\n\n**1. Calculate the Present Value of the Expected Future Benefit**\n\nThe benefit is the reduction of future harm from iron overload, which is made possible by early awareness leading to adult monitoring.\n- The magnitude of the benefit, if the condition manifests, is the reduction in QALY loss: $\\Delta S = 0.01$ QALYs.\n- This benefit is realized only if the child develops mild iron overload, which occurs with probability $p_m = 0.10$.\n- The expected benefit, in future value, is the product of the probability and the magnitude of the benefit:\n$$E(\\text{Benefit}) = p_m \\times \\Delta S = 0.10 \\times 0.01 = 0.001 \\text{ QALYs}$$\n- This benefit is realized in the future, at a time $t = 15$ years. To compare it with immediate harms, we must discount it to its present value using the given annual rate $r = 0.03$. The formula for present value ($PV$) is $PV = \\frac{\\text{Future Value}}{(1+r)^t}$.\n$$PV(E(\\text{Benefit})) = \\frac{E(\\text{Benefit})}{(1+r)^t} = \\frac{0.001}{(1+0.03)^{15}} = \\frac{0.001}{(1.03)^{15}}$$\n- Calculating the denominator: $(1.03)^{15} \\approx 1.557967$.\n$$PV(E(\\text{Benefit})) \\approx \\frac{0.001}{1.557967} \\approx 0.0006418 \\text{ QALYs}$$\n\n**2. Calculate the Expected Immediate Harm**\n\nIf the result is disclosed to the $10$-year-old child, there are two potential sources of immediate psychosocial harm, which are stated to be independent.\n- The expected harm from stigmatization is the product of its probability and magnitude:\n$$E(H_s) = p_s \\times H_s = 0.35 \\times 0.04 = 0.014 \\text{ QALYs}$$\n- The expected harm from anxiety is the product of its probability and magnitude:\n$$E(H_a) = p_a \\times H_a = 0.50 \\times 0.02 = 0.010 \\text{ QALYs}$$\n- Since these harms are independent, the total expected immediate harm, $E(H_{\\text{total}})$, is the sum of the individual expected harms. As these harms are immediate, no discounting is necessary.\n$$E(H_{\\text{total}}) = E(H_s) + E(H_a) = 0.014 + 0.010 = 0.024 \\text{ QALYs}$$\n\n**3. Compare Harms and Benefits & Apply Harm Threshold**\n\nWe must now compare the calculated values to determine the best course of action.\n\n- **Disclosure to the child:**\n  - Net expected outcome = $PV(E(\\text{Benefit})) - E(H_{\\text{total}})$\n  - Net expected outcome $\\approx 0.00064 - 0.024 = -0.02336$ QALYs.\n  - This is a significant net harm. The expected immediate harm ($0.024$ QALYs) is substantially larger than the discounted expected future benefit ($0.00064$ QALYs). This course of action is not in the child's best interest.\n\n- **Harm Threshold Analysis:**\n  - The problem defines a harm threshold $H^\\ast = 0.01$ QALYs as \"the minimum present-value expected harm that justifies accepting immediate psychosocial harm\". This means one should only accept the immediate harm if the preventable future harm (i.e., the benefit) is at least $H^\\ast$.\n  - In our case, the present value of the expected benefit is $PV(E(\\text benefit)) \\approx 0.00064$ QALYs.\n  - Since $0.00064 < 0.01$, the potential benefit does not meet the specified threshold of seriousness to justify imposing *any* immediate harm. This provides a second, independent reason to avoid disclosure to the child.\n\n- **Confidential counseling to parents:**\n  - The problem states this strategy achieves the same future benefit ($\\Delta S$) while \"minimizing the child’s immediate psychosocial exposure\". We can model this as avoiding the harms $H_s$ and $H_a$.\n  - Expected immediate harm to child: $0$ QALYs.\n  - Present value of expected future benefit: $\\approx 0.00064$ QALYs.\n  - Net expected outcome $\\approx 0.00064 - 0 = +0.00064$ QALYs.\n  - This course of action produces a net benefit, albeit a small one.\n\nBased on this quantitative analysis, the optimal strategy is to inform the parents confidentially, which secures the future benefit without exposing the child to the immediate, and much larger, psychosocial harms. Therefore, immediate disclosure to the child is contraindicated.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Disclose the variant to the child now with detailed counseling, because preventing later mild morbidity produces a present-value expected benefit that exceeds the expected immediate psychosocial harm.**\nOur calculation shows that the present-value expected benefit ($\\approx 0.00064$ QALYs) is far exceeded by the expected immediate psychosocial harm ($0.024$ QALYs). The reasoning provided in this option is factually incorrect based on the problem's own parameters.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Do not disclose to the child now; provide confidential counseling to the parents and document a plan to revisit disclosure at adolescence, because the expected immediate psychosocial harm to the child exceeds the discounted expected benefit of early awareness, and the benefit can be achieved via parental planning without child stigmatization.**\nThis option's reasoning is fully supported by our analysis. First, it correctly states that the immediate psychosocial harm of disclosure to the child ($0.024$ QALYs) exceeds the discounted expected benefit ($\\approx 0.00064$ QALYs). Second, it identifies the superior alternative path given in the problem: counseling parents to achieve the benefit without the harm. The suggestion to revisit disclosure at adolescence is consistent with ethical principles of respecting the child's \"right to an open future\" and emerging autonomy, which is a standard component of AAP/ACMG guidance.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Withhold the variant from both the child and parents and avoid recording it in the medical record, because any disclosure risks stigmatization and anxiety that outweigh potential future benefits.**\nThis option results in a net outcome of $0$, as the future benefit is foregone. Option B achieves a net positive outcome ($\\approx +0.00064$ QALYs). Therefore, Option B is superior. Withholding the information from the parents prevents them from acting in their child's future best interest. Furthermore, not recording a known genetic finding in the medical record is professionally questionable and could lead to loss of information for future care.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Disclose the variant now and add it to the school health record to enable school-based accommodations, because transparent sharing maximizes justice and beneficence despite short-term psychosocial risks.**\nThis option advocates for disclosure to the child, which we have shown causes net harm. It further suggests sharing this private health information with the school, an action that is medically unnecessary (no accommodations are needed for this condition), increases the risk of the specified harms (stigmatization), and constitutes a breach of medical confidentiality. This course of action violates the principles of nonmaleficence and privacy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Offer the $10$-year-old child the choice to hear the result immediately and proceed only if the child assents, because autonomy at this developmental stage should determine whether the harm threshold is met.**\nA $10$-year-old does not have the capacity for mature, autonomous medical decision-making (consent), but can provide assent. However, the clinician's and parents' primary duty is to protect the child's best interests. Shifting a decision with a demonstrably negative expected outcome to a child is an abdication of that duty. The harm-benefit analysis shows that disclosure is not in the child's best interest. Invoking \"assent\" to proceed with a harmful action is ethically unsound. The best interests standard, supported by the quantitative analysis, overrides the procedural step of seeking assent in this case.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5139485"}]}
