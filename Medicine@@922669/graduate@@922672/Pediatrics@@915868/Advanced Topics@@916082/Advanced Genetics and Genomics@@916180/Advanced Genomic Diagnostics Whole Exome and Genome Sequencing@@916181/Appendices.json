Consider a uniform region of length $10$ megabases, that is, $1.0 \\times 10^{7}$ bases. Suppose every base in this region is assigned a constant quality score $Q = 35$ by the sequencing instrument. Assume independent base-calling errors across positions.\n\nUsing the formal definition of the Phred quality score and standard probability theory for sums of independent Bernoulli trials, derive the per-base error probability $p_{\\mathrm{error}}$ and the expected number of incorrect base calls over the $10$ megabase region. Round both quantities to four significant figures. Express the expected number as a pure count (no units).", "solution": "The problem asks for two quantities: the per-base error probability, denoted as $p_{\\mathrm{error}}$, and the expected number of incorrect base calls in a genomic region of a specified length, given a constant Phred quality score.\n\nFirst, we address the per-base error probability, $p_{\\mathrm{error}}$. The Phred quality score, $Q$, is formally defined as a logarithmic measure of the error probability. The relationship is given by the equation:\n$$\nQ = -10 \\log_{10}(p_{\\mathrm{error}})\n$$\nwhere $p_{\\mathrm{error}}$ is the probability that the corresponding base call is incorrect.\n\nWe are given that the quality score is constant for all bases in the region, with a value of $Q = 35$. To find $p_{\\mathrm{error}}$, we must solve the defining equation for $p_{\\mathrm{error}}$.\nDividing both sides by $-10$, we have:\n$$\n-\\frac{Q}{10} = \\log_{10}(p_{\\mathrm{error}})\n$$\nTo isolate $p_{\\mathrm{error}}$, we use the property that if $y = \\log_{b}(x)$, then $x = b^{y}$. Applying this to our equation, we get:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{error}} = 10^{-Q/10}\n$$\nSubstituting the given value $Q = 35$:\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{error}} = 10^{-35/10} = 10^{-3.5}\n$$\nTo express this as a numerical value, we can write $10^{-3.5}$ as $10^{0.5} \\times 10^{-4}$.

The region has a length of $N = 10$ megabases, which is equivalent to $N = 1.0 \\times 10^{7}$ bases.\n\nThe process of calling each base can be modeled as a Bernoulli trial. Let $X_i$ be an indicator random variable for the $i$-th base in the sequence, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$. We define $X_i = 1$ if the base call is incorrect and $X_i = 0$ if the base call is correct.\nThe probability of an incorrect call is $P(X_i = 1) = p_{\\mathrm{error}}$.\nThe probability of a correct call is $P(X_i = 0) = 1 - p_{\\mathrm{error}}$.\n\nThe expected value of a single Bernoulli trial is given by $E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i = 1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i = 0) = p_{\\mathrm{error}}$.\n\nThe total number of incorrect base calls, let's call it $K$, is the sum of these individual indicator variables over the entire region:\n$$\nK = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\n$$\nThe problem states that base-calling errors are independent. Due to the linearity of expectation, the expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of their expected values, regardless of their independence.\n$$\nE[K] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]\n$$\nSince each base has the same constant quality score, the error probability $p_{\\mathrm{error}}$ is the same for all $N$ bases. Therefore, $E[X_i] = p_{\\mathrm{error}}$ for all $i$.\n$$\nE[K] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_{\\mathrm{error}} = N \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{error}}\n$$\nThis result is also the mean of a binomial distribution, $B(N, p_{\\mathrm{error}})$, which precisely models the total number of errors in a sequence of $N$ independent trials.\n\nNow, we substitute the values for $N$ and $p_{\\mathrm{error}}$:\n$$\nN = 1.0 \\times 10^{7}\n$$\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{error}} = 10^{-3.5}\n$$\nThe expected number of incorrect calls is:\n$$\nE[K] = (1.0 \\times 10^{7}) \\times 10^{-3.5} = 10^{7} \\times 10^{-3.5} = 10^{7 - 3.5} = 10^{3.5}\n$$\nWe calculate the numerical value:\n$$\nE[K] = 10^{3.5} = \\sqrt{10} \\times 10^3 \\approx 3.16227766 \\times 1000 = 3162.27766\n$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nE[K] \\approx 3162\n$$\n\nThe two requested quantities, rounded to four significant figures, are the per-base error probability $p_{\\mathrm{error}} \\approx 3.162 \\times 10^{-4}$ and the expected number of incorrect base calls $E[K] \\approx 3162$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3.162 \\times 10^{-4} & 3162 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5100154"}, {"introduction": "Identifying genetic variants is only the first step; understanding their origin is critical for diagnosis, especially in pediatric genetics.

Assume the following fundamental bases: (i) replication-induced point mutations arise during gametogenesis and transmission follows the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (DNA to RNA to protein), (ii) de novo SNVs along a target region can be modeled as events of a spatially homogeneous Poisson point process with a constant per-base hazard rate, and (iii) the expected number of events equals the integral of the hazard rate over the target length. Consider a child whose de novo point mutation rate is $1.2 \\times 10^{-8}$ per base pair on the exome. The haploid exome target size is $30$ megabases ($30 \\ \\text{Mb} = 3.0 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\text{bp}$). For parental age effects, use an empirically supported linear model at the genome-wide scale: relative to baseline ages of $A_{p0} = 30$ years (father) and $A_{m0} = 28$ years (mother), each additional paternal year increases the expected number of genome-wide de novo SNVs by $c_{p} = 1.8$, and each additional maternal year increases it by $c_{m} = 0.5$. Take the haploid genome size to be $L_{g} = 3.0 \\times 10^{9} \\ \\text{bp}$. Assume the per-base rate in the exome scales proportionally with the genome-wide increment in expected count, i.e., the age-related changes in expected genome-wide counts correspond to per-base rate increments of $(c_{p}/L_{g})$ per paternal year and $(c_{m}/L_{g})$ per maternal year, applied homogeneously to the exome. \n\nTasks:\n1.

Additionally, a brief mechanistic explanation for the paternal age effect is requested.\n\nFirst, we address Task 1: calculate the expected number of de novo SNVs at baseline. The problem states that de novo SNVs can be modeled as events of a spatially homogeneous Poisson point process with a constant per-base hazard rate, $\\mu$. The expected number of events, $E[N]$, in a target region of length $L$ is the integral of the rate over the length. For a constant rate, this simplifies to:\n$$E[N] = \\int_{0}^{L} \\mu \\, dx = \\mu L$$\nThe baseline de novo point mutation rate in the exome is given as $\\mu_0 = 1.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{bp}^{-1}$. The haploid exome target size is $L_e = 3.0 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\text{bp}$.\nTherefore, the expected number of de novo SNVs in the exome at baseline, denoted as $E_0$, is:\n$$E_0 = \\mu_0 L_e = (1.2 \\times 10^{-8} \\ \\text{bp}^{-1}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\text{bp}) = 0.36$$\n\nBefore proceeding to Task 2, we provide the requested mechanistic explanation for the stronger paternal age effect on de novo SNV counts. The primary source of de novo SNVs is errors during DNA replication. In males, spermatogonial stem cells undergo continuous mitotic divisions throughout reproductive life to produce sperm. The number of cell divisions, and thus the opportunities for replication errors, accumulates with age. In contrast, females are born with a fixed complement of primary oocytes, which are arrested in meiotic prophase I. DNA replication in the female germline is completed before birth. Consequently, the number of germline replication cycles does not increase with maternal age. The strong correlation between paternal age and de novo SNV counts is a direct consequence of this lifelong accumulation of DNA replication cycles in the male germline. The smaller maternal age effect is attributed to other mechanisms, such as an accumulation of DNA damage over time in the arrested oocytes.\n\nNext, we address Task 2: derive a closed-form expression for the age-modified expected number of de novo SNVs. The model for parental age effects is linear. The baseline ages are $A_{p0} = 30$ years for the father and $A_{m0} = 28$ years for the mother. The father's actual age is $A_p = 40$ years, and the mother's is $A_m = 35$ years. The age differences are:\n$$\\Delta A_p = A_p - A_{p0} = 40 - 30 = 10 \\ \\text{years}$$\n$$\\Delta A_m = A_m - A_{m0} = 35 - 28 = 7 \\ \\text{years}$$\nThe model states that each additional paternal year increases the expected number of genome-wide de novo SNVs by $c_p = 1.8$, and each additional maternal year by $c_m = 0.5$. The total increase in the expected number of de novo SNVs across the haploid genome of size $L_g = 3.0 \\times 10^{9} \\ \\text{bp}$ is:\n$$\\Delta N_{\\text{genome}} = c_p \\Delta A_p + c_m \\Delta A_m$$\nThe problem states that the per-base rate in the exome scales proportionally with the genome-wide increment in expected count. This implies that the additional expected number of SNVs in the exome, $\\Delta E_{\\text{exome}}$, is the total genome-wide increase scaled by the ratio of the exome length to the genome length:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\text{exome}} = \\Delta N_{\\text{genome}} \\times \\frac{L_e}{L_g} = (c_p \\Delta A_p + c_m \\Delta A_m) \\frac{L_e}{L_g}$$\nThe total age-modified expected number of de novo SNVs in the exome, $E_{\\text{age}}$, is the sum of the baseline expectation $E_0$ and the age-related increase $\\Delta E_{\\text{exome}}$.\n$$E_{\\text{age}} = E_0 + \\Delta E_{\\text{exome}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $E_0$ and $\\Delta E_{\\text{exome}}$, we obtain the closed-form expression:\n$$E_{\\text{age}} = \\mu_0 L_e + (c_p (A_p - A_{p0}) + c_m (A_m - A_{m0})) \\frac{L_e}{L_g}$$\n\nFinally, we address Task 3: compute the numerical value of $E_{\\text{age}}$. We substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression.\nThe baseline expectation was already calculated as $E_0 = 0.36$.\nWe now calculate the age-related increase, $\\Delta E_{\\text{exome}}$:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\text{exome}} = ((1.8) \\times (10) + (0.5) \\times (7)) \\times \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{7}}{3.0 \\times 10^{9}}$$\n$$\\Delta E_{\\text{exome}} = (18 + 3.5) \\times (10^{-2})$$\n$$\\Delta E_{\\text{exome}} = (21.5) \\times (0.01) = 0.215$$\nThe total age-modified expected number of de novo SNVs in the exome is the sum of the baseline and the age-dependent components:\n$$E_{\\text{age}} = E_0 + \\Delta E_{\\text{exome}} = 0.36 + 0.215 = 0.575$$\nThe problem asks for the result rounded to three significant figures.

Pathogenic\n\nB. Likely pathogenic\n\nC. Variant of uncertain significance\n\nD. Benign", "solution": "The solution is derived by applying the 2015 ACMG/AMP \"Standards and Guidelines for the Interpretation of Sequence Variants\". This framework uses evidence codes of varying strengths (Very Strong, Strong, Moderate, Supporting) to classify variants into one of five categories: Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic, Variant of Uncertain Significance, Likely Benign, or Benign.\n\nThe foundational principles are as follows:\n1.  **Central Dogma and Genotype-to-Phenotype Causality:** A change in the DNA sequence (genotype, e.g., $c.4021G>A$) can lead to an altered protein (e.g., $p.Gly1341Arg$), which in turn may disrupt its biological function (e.g., reduced ion channel current), causing a specific disease (phenotype, e.g., epileptic encephalopathy).\n2.  **Population Genetics (Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium Context):** For severe, dominantly inherited diseases that manifest early in life and reduce reproductive fitness, natural selection will act to keep the causative alleles at an extremely low frequency in the general population. Therefore, the rarity of a variant is a necessary, albeit not sufficient, condition for it to be pathogenic for such a disorder.\n\nWe will now systematically evaluate the provided evidence against the ACMG/AMP criteria.\n\n1.  **De Novo Status (PS2 - Pathogenic Strong):** The problem states, \"Parental testing and kinship analysis confirm the variant arose de novo in the proband (maternity and paternity confirmed).\" The appearance of a variant in an affected individual that is absent from both biologically confirmed parents is very strong evidence of causality for a dominant disorder. This meets the criterion **PS2**, which is weighted as **Strong** evidence for pathogenicity.\n\n2.  **Functional Studies (PS3 - Pathogenic Strong):** The problem describes, \"A well-established patch-clamp functional assay...demonstrates a $>90\\%$ reduction in peak current relative to wild-type channels\". This result is \"consistent with loss of function in a gene where loss of function is a known mechanism of disease for this phenotype.\" A well-validated functional study showing a clear damaging effect that aligns with the known disease mechanism is powerful evidence. This meets criterion **PS3**, which is also weighted as **Strong** evidence for pathogenicity.\n\n3.  **Allele Frequency (PM2 - Pathogenic Moderate):** The variant is present in gnomAD at an allele frequency of $1 \\times 10^{-5}$. For a severe, childhood-onset autosomal dominant disease like the one described, causative variants are expected to be extremely rare. An allele frequency of $1 \\times 10^{-5}$ is well below the threshold of what would be considered too common for such a disorder. The absence of a variant from, or its presence at an extremely low frequency in, large population databases is moderate evidence for pathogenicity. This meets criterion **PM2**, weighted as **Moderate**.\n\n4.  **Phenotype Specificity (PP4 - Pathogenic Supporting):** The patient's phenotype (\"severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, global developmental delay, and hypotonia\") is highly consistent with diseases caused by variants in voltage-gated sodium channel genes. While epileptic encephalopathy is genetically heterogeneous, the overall clinical picture combined with the specific gene class makes the phenotype strongly suggestive. This can be considered to meet criterion **PP4**, weighted as **Supporting**.\n\n**Combining the Evidence:**\nAccording to the ACMG/AMP combinatorial rules, the classification is determined by the set of criteria met. We have accumulated:\n- **PS2** (Strong)\n- **PS3** (Strong)\n- **PM2** (Moderate)\n- **PP4** (Supporting)\n\nThe rule for a **Pathogenic** classification states that a variant can be classified as such if it meets criteria such as:\n- $\\geq 2$ Strong (e.g., PS1-PS4)\n\nIn this case, we have identified two Strong criteria: **PS2** and **PS3**. This combination alone is sufficient to classify the variant as Pathogenic. The additional Moderate (PM2) and Supporting (PP4) evidence further strengthen this conclusion but are not strictly necessary to reach the \"Pathogenic\" threshold.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate classification for the $c.4021G>A$ ($p.Gly1341Arg$) variant is Pathogenic.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Pathogenic**\nThis classification requires meeting a high evidence threshold, such as having at least two \"Strong\" pieces of pathogenic evidence. As derived above, the confirmed de novo status (PS2) and the conclusive loss-of-function result from a well-established functional assay (PS3) provide the necessary two \"Strong\" criteria. Therefore, this classification is appropriate.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Likely pathogenic**\nThis classification is used when the evidence is strong but falls short of the \"Pathogenic\" threshold (e.g., 1 Strong and 1-2 Moderate criteria). The evidence in this case (2 Strong criteria) exceeds the requirements for \"Likely pathogenic\" and fully supports a \"Pathogenic\" classification. While a pathogenic variant is, by definition, also likely pathogenic, the ACMG framework directs the user to apply the most definitive classification supported by the evidence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Variant of uncertain significance**\nThis classification is reserved for cases where there is insufficient evidence for a more definitive classification, or where the evidence is conflicting. Here, multiple, independent lines of evidence (inheritance, population frequency, functional data, phenotype) are all consistent and point unequivocally towards pathogenicity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Benign**\nThis classification is used for variants that are common in the general population or have been functionally shown to have no impact. The variant in question is extremely rare and has been functionally demonstrated to cause a severe loss of function, which is the exact opposite of what would be expected for a benign variant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5100142"}]}
