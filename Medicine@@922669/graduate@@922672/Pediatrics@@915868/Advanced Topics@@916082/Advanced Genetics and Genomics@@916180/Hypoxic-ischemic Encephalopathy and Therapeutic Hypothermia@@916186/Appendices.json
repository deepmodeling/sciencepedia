The data are consistent and realistic for a randomized controlled trial in neonatology. The task requires a standard epidemiological derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution: first, the derivation of the formula for the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), and second, the application of this formula to the provided clinical trial data.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Number Needed to Treat (NNT)**\n\nLet us start from the foundational definitions provided.\n\nThe risk, $R$, of an outcome is defined as the proportion of individuals in a group who experience that outcome.\nFor the control group, the risk is $R_{\\mathrm{control}}$.\nFor the intervention (treatment) group, the risk is $R_{\\mathrm{intervention}}$.\n\nThe problem provides data for a control arm and a cooling (intervention) arm. Let $n_{\\mathrm{control}}$ be the number of subjects in the control arm and $e_{\\mathrm{control}}$ be the number of subjects in that arm who experience the adverse event (the primary composite outcome). The risk in the control arm is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{control}} = \\frac{e_{\\mathrm{control}}}{n_{\\mathrm{control}}}$$\n\nSimilarly, let $n_{\\mathrm{intervention}}$ be the number of subjects in the intervention arm and $e_{\\mathrm{intervention}}$ be the number of subjects in that arm who experience the adverse event. The risk in the intervention arm is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{intervention}} = \\frac{e_{\\mathrm{intervention}}}{n_{\\mathrm{intervention}}}$$\n\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is defined as the difference in risk between the control and intervention arms. A positive ARR indicates that the intervention reduces the risk of the adverse outcome.\n$$ARR = R_{\\mathrm{control}} - R_{\\mathrm{intervention}}$$\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is defined conceptually as the number of patients who must receive the treatment to prevent one additional adverse outcome, compared to the control condition. We can formalize this from the definition of ARR.\n\nConsider a cohort of $N$ patients who are given the treatment.\nIf these $N$ patients had not been treated (i.e., if they were in the control group), the expected number of adverse outcomes would be:\n$$\\text{Expected events}_{\\mathrm{control}} = N \\times R_{\\mathrm{control}}$$\n\nSince these $N$ patients are, in fact, treated, the number of observed adverse outcomes is:\n$$\\text{Observed events}_{\\mathrm{intervention}} = N \\times R_{\\mathrm{intervention}}$$\n\nThe number of adverse outcomes prevented by treating this cohort of $N$ patients is the difference between the expected number of events without treatment and the observed number of events with treatment.\n$$\\text{Events Prevented} = (\\text{Expected events}_{\\mathrm{control}}) - (\\text{Observed events}_{\\mathrm{intervention}})$$\n$$\\text{Events Prevented} = (N \\times R_{\\mathrm{control}}) - (N \\times R_{\\mathrm{intervention}})$$\nFactoring out $N$, we get:\n$$\\text{Events Prevented} = N \\times (R_{\\mathrm{control}} - R_{\\mathrm{intervention}})$$\nSubstituting the definition of ARR:\n$$\\text{Events Prevented} = N \\times ARR$$\n\nThe NNT is the specific value of $N$ for which exactly one adverse outcome is prevented. Therefore, we set `Events Prevented` to $1$:\n$$1 = NNT \\times ARR$$\n\nSolving for NNT, we arrive at the general expression for the Number Needed to Treat in terms of the Absolute Risk Reduction:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\n**Part 2: Application to the Trial Data**\n\nWe are given the following data from the randomized controlled trial:\nFor the cooling (intervention) arm: $n_{\\mathrm{cool}} = 160$ and $e_{\\mathrm{cool}} = 76$.\nFor the standard care (control) arm: $n_{\\mathrm{control}} = 160$ and $e_{\\mathrm{control}} = 96$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the risk in the control arm ($R_{\\mathrm{control}}$):\n$$R_{\\mathrm{control}} = \\frac{e_{\\mathrm{control}}}{n_{\\mathrm{control}}} = \\frac{96}{160}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the risk in the cooling arm ($R_{\\mathrm{cool}}$), which corresponds to $R_{\\mathrm{intervention}}$ in our general derivation:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{cool}} = \\frac{e_{\\mathrm{cool}}}{n_{\\mathrm{cool}}} = \\frac{76}{160}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR):\n$$ARR = R_{\\mathrm{control}} - R_{\\mathrm{cool}} = \\frac{96}{160} - \\frac{76}{160}$$\n$$ARR = \\frac{96 - 76}{160} = \\frac{20}{160}$$\n\nThis fraction can be simplified:\n$$ARR = \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{1}{8}$$\n\nFinally, we use the derived formula for NNT to calculate its value for this specific trial:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{8}}$$\n$$NNT = 8$$\n\nThe NNT is $8$. This signifies that, on average, $8$ infants with moderate-to-severe HIE must be treated with therapeutic hypothermia to prevent one additional case of death or moderate-to-severe neurodevelopmental disability at $24$ months.

We will proceed by defining the relevant pharmacokinetic parameters and applying fundamental principles.\n\nLet the patient's weight be $W = 3.2$ kg.\nThe target average steady-state plasma concentration is $C_{ss,avg} = 20$ mg/L.\nThe normothermic weight-based volume of distribution is $(V_d/W)_{normo} = 0.9$ L/kg.\nThe normothermic weight-based clearance is $(CL/W)_{normo} = 0.008$ L/kg/h.\nThe dosing interval for maintenance doses is $\\tau = 12$ h.\nTherapeutic hypothermia reduces clearance by $30\\%$.\n\n**1. Loading Dose Calculation**\n\nThe purpose of a loading dose ($LD$) is to rapidly achieve a target plasma concentration by filling the apparent volume of distribution ($V_d$). The fundamental relationship between the amount of drug in the body ($A$), the plasma concentration ($C$), and the volume of distribution is:\n$$A = C \\times V_d$$\nFor an intravenous loading dose with instantaneous distribution, the entire dose is assumed to enter the systemic circulation immediately, resulting in an initial concentration, $C_0$. To achieve the target concentration, we set $C_0$ equal to the desired concentration, which in this problem is the target average steady-state concentration, $C_{ss,avg}$.\n$$LD = C_{ss,avg} \\times V_d$$\nThe problem implies that therapeutic hypothermia primarily affects clearance, a common assumption in clinical practice. Therefore, we will use the normothermic volume of distribution for the loading dose calculation.\n\nFirst, we calculate the weight-based loading dose, $LD_{wb}$, in mg/kg. This uses the weight-based volume of distribution, $(V_d/W)$.\n$$LD_{wb} = C_{ss,avg} \\times \\left(\\frac{V_d}{W}\\right)_{normo}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$LD_{wb} = 20 \\text{ mg/L} \\times 0.9 \\text{ L/kg} = 18 \\text{ mg/kg}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the weight-based loading dose is $18.0$ mg/kg.\n\nNext, we calculate the absolute loading dose, $LD_{abs}$, in mg for this specific patient.\n$$LD_{abs} = LD_{wb} \\times W$$\nUsing the calculated weight-based dose and the patient's weight:\n$$LD_{abs} = 18 \\text{ mg/kg} \\times 3.2 \\text{ kg} = 57.6 \\text{ mg}$$\nThis value is already at three significant figures.\n\n**2. Maintenance Dose Calculation**\n\nThe maintenance dose ($MD$) is designed to replace the amount of drug eliminated from the body over a dosing interval, $\\tau$, thereby maintaining the plasma concentration at a steady state. The principle of steady state dictates that the rate of drug administration must equal the rate of drug elimination.\n\nThe rate of elimination is the product of total body clearance ($CL$) and the average steady-state concentration ($C_{ss,avg}$).\n$$\\text{Rate of Elimination} = CL \\times C_{ss,avg}$$\nThe rate of administration for intermittent dosing is the maintenance dose per dose ($MD$) divided by the dosing interval ($\\tau$).\n$$\\text{Rate of Administration} = \\frac{MD}{\\tau}$$\nEquating these two rates gives the fundamental equation for the maintenance dose:\n$$\\frac{MD}{\\tau} = CL \\times C_{ss,avg} \\implies MD = CL \\times C_{ss,avg} \\times \\tau$$\nThis problem specifies that therapeutic hypothermia reduces clearance by $30\\%$. First, we must calculate the clearance under hypothermic conditions, $CL_{hypo}$. We apply this reduction to the given normothermic clearance value. We will perform the calculation on a weight-based basis.\n$$(CL/W)_{hypo} = (CL/W)_{normo} \\times (1 - 0.30) = (CL/W)_{normo} \\times 0.70$$\nSubstituting the given value:\n$$(CL/W)_{hypo} = 0.008 \\text{ L/kg/h} \\times 0.70 = 0.0056 \\text{ L/kg/h}$$\nNow, we can calculate the weight-based maintenance dose per dose, $MD_{wb}$, in mg/kg per dose.\n$$MD_{wb} = (CL/W)_{hypo} \\times C_{ss,avg} \\times \\tau$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$MD_{wb} = 0.0056 \\text{ L/kg/h} \\times 20 \\text{ mg/L} \\times 12 \\text{ h} = 1.344 \\text{ mg/kg per dose}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $1.34$ mg/kg per dose.\n\nFinally, we calculate the absolute maintenance dose per dose, $MD_{abs}$, in mg per dose for this patient.\n$$MD_{abs} = MD_{wb} \\times W$$\nUsing the unrounded weight-based maintenance dose for better precision before the final rounding:\n$$MD_{abs} = 1.344 \\text{ mg/kg} \\times 3.2 \\text{ kg} = 4.3008 \\text{ mg}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $4.30$ mg per dose.\n\nThe four required values are:\n1.
