A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to calculate the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ($\\text{LDL-C}$) in units of milligrams per deciliter ($\\text{mg/dL}$). The starting point is the mass balance of total cholesterol ($\\text{TC}$) in the plasma, which is distributed among the major lipoprotein fractions: high-density lipoprotein ($\\text{HDL}$), low-density lipoprotein ($\\text{LDL}$), and very-low-density lipoprotein ($\\text{VLDL}$). The relationship is:\n$$ \\text{TC} = \\text{HDL-C} + \\text{LDL-C} + \\text{VLDL-C} $$\nTo solve for $\\text{LDL-C}$, we rearrange this equation:\n$$ \\text{LDL-C} = \\text{TC} - \\text{HDL-C} - \\text{VLDL-C} $$\nFor this equation to be dimensionally consistent, all terms must be expressed in the same units. The problem requires the final answer for $\\text{LDL-C}$ in $\\text{mg/dL}$, so we must convert all terms on the right-hand side to $\\text{mg/dL}$.\n\nLet's denote the given concentrations in SI units ($\\text{mmol/L}$) with a subscript $\\text{SI}$, and the concentrations in conventional units ($\\text{mg/dL}$) with a subscript $\\text{conv}$.\nThe given values are:\n- $ \\text{TC}_{\\text{SI}} = 4.8 \\text{ mmol/L} $\n- $ \\text{HDL-C}_{\\text{SI}} = 1.2 \\text{ mmol/L} $\n- $ \\text{TG}_{\\text{SI}} = 1.6 \\text{ mmol/L} $\n\nThe conversion factors are:\n- $ C_{\\text{chol}} = 38.67 \\frac{\\text{mg/dL}}{\\text{mmol/L}} $\n- $ C_{\\text{TG}} = 88.57 \\frac{\\text{mg/dL}}{\\text{mmol/L}} $\n\nFirst, we convert $\\text{TC}$ and $\\text{HDL-C}$ from $\\text{mmol/L}$ to $\\text{mg/dL}$:\n$$ \\text{TC}_{\\text{conv}} = \\text{TC}_{\\text{SI}} \\times C_{\\text{chol}} $$\n$$ \\text{HDL-C}_{\\text{conv}} = \\text{HDL-C}_{\\text{SI}} \\times C_{\\text{chol}} $$\n\nNext, we must determine the value of $\\text{VLDL-C}$ in $\\text{mg/dL}$. The problem provides the standard clinical approximation (part of the Friedewald formula), which relates $\\text{VLDL-C}$ to triglycerides ($\\text{TG}$), both in conventional units ($\\text{mg/dL}$):\n$$ \\text{VLDL-C}_{\\text{conv}} \\approx \\frac{\\text{TG}_{\\text{conv}}}{5} $$\nTo use this approximation, we must first convert the given triglyceride concentration from $\\text{mmol/L}$ to $\\text{mg/dL}$:\n$$ \\text{TG}_{\\text{conv}} = \\text{TG}_{\\text{SI}} \\times C_{\\text{TG}} $$\nSubstituting this into the approximation for $\\text{VLDL-C}$:\n$$ \\text{VLDL-C}_{\\text{conv}} \\approx \\frac{\\text{TG}_{\\text{SI}} \\times C_{\\text{TG}}}{5} $$\n\nNow we have all terms in the required units.

The pharmacodynamic model, based on first-order kinetics and a linear stimulus-response relationship, is a standard and appropriate approximation for this type of problem. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient data to determine the model parameters and solve for the unknown infusion rate. The language is objective and precise. The patient's weight is provided but is not necessary for calculating the infusion rate in units of $\\mathrm{units/kg/h}$, making it extraneous but not contradictory information.

The solution to this equation is an exponential decay function:\n$$C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt)$$\nwhere $C_0$ is the initial concentration and $k$ is the first-order rate constant.\n\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time required for the concentration to decrease to half of its initial value, i.e., $C(t_{1/2}) = C_0/2$.

The corresponding rate constant is:\n$$k(I_{\\mathrm{ref}}) = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{6.0\\ \\mathrm{h}}$$\nUsing the linear model, we have $k(I_{\\mathrm{ref}}) = k_b + \\alpha I_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.
