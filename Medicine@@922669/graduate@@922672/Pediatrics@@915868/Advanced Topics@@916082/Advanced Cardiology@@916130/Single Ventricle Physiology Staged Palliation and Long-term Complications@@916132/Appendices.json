The core principle to be used, conservation of mass (applied to oxygen transport), is a fundamental concept in physiology (often expressed as the Fick principle). The given saturation values ($S_{pv}$ of $98\\%$, $S_v$ of $60\\%$) are physiologically plausible. The assumption that oxygen content is proportional to saturation is a standard simplification when hemoglobin concentration is constant and dissolved oxygen is ignored. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is based on the principle of conservation of oxygen in the common mixing chamber (the single functional ventricle). In a steady state, the total rate of oxygen entering the chamber must equal the total rate of oxygen leaving it.\n\nThe rate of oxygen flow, or oxygen flux, in a blood vessel is the product of the blood flow rate ($Q$) and the oxygen content of the blood ($C_{O_2}$). The problem states that oxygen content is proportional to hemoglobin saturation ($S$). We can express this as $C_{O_2} = k \\cdot S$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality that combines the hemoglobin concentration and the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin.\n\nOxygen enters the common ventricle from two sources:\n1.  The pulmonary venous return, with blood flow $Q_p$ and saturation $S_{pv}$. The oxygen flux from this source is $Q_p \\cdot (k \\cdot S_{pv})$.\n2.  The systemic venous return, with blood flow $Q_s$ and saturation $S_v$. The oxygen flux from this source is $Q_s \\cdot (k \\cdot S_v)$.\n\nThe total oxygen flux into the mixing chamber is the sum of these two fluxes:\n$$ \\text{Flux}_{\\text{in}} = Q_p \\cdot k \\cdot S_{pv} + Q_s \\cdot k \\cdot S_v $$\n\nAfter complete mixing in the ventricle, the blood is ejected with a uniform saturation, $S_a$. This mixed blood constitutes the total cardiac output, which is the sum of the pulmonary and systemic flows, $Q_p + Q_s$. The total oxygen flux leaving the ventricle is:\n$$ \\text{Flux}_{\\text{out}} = (Q_p + Q_s) \\cdot k \\cdot S_a $$\n\nBy the principle of conservation of oxygen:\n$$ \\text{Flux}_{\\text{in}} = \\text{Flux}_{\\text{out}} $$\n$$ Q_p \\cdot k \\cdot S_{pv} + Q_s \\cdot k \\cdot S_v = (Q_p + Q_s) \\cdot k \\cdot S_a $$\n\nThe constant of proportionality $k$ is non-zero and appears in every term, so it can be canceled from the equation:\n$$ Q_p S_{pv} + Q_s S_v = (Q_p + Q_s) S_a $$\n\nWe need to solve for the systemic arterial oxygen saturation, $S_a$:\n$$ S_a = \\frac{Q_p S_{pv} + Q_s S_v}{Q_p + Q_s} $$\n\nThis equation shows that the mixed arterial saturation is the flow-weighted average of the pulmonary and systemic venous saturations. To use the given ratio $\\frac{Q_{p}}{Q_{s}}$, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator of the expression for $S_a$ by $Q_s$:\n$$ S_a = \\frac{\\frac{Q_p}{Q_s} S_{pv} + \\frac{Q_s}{Q_s} S_v}{\\frac{Q_p}{Q_s} + \\frac{Q_s}{Q_s}} $$\n$$ S_a = \\frac{(\\frac{Q_p}{Q_s}) S_{pv} + S_v}{(\\frac{Q_p}{Q_s}) + 1} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $S_{pv} = 0.98$, $S_{v} = 0.60$, and $\\frac{Q_{p}}{Q_{s}} = 2.0$.\n$$ S_a = \\frac{(2.0)(0.98) + 0.60}{2.0 + 1} $$\n$$ S_a = \\frac{1.96 + 0.60}{3.0} $$\n$$ S_a = \\frac{2.56}{3.0} $$\n$$ S_a = 0.853333... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ S_a \\approx 0.8533 $$\nThis value represents a systemic arterial oxygen saturation of approximately $85.33\\%$, which is a typical target in the management of patients after the Norwood procedure to ensure a balance between systemic oxygen delivery and pulmonary blood flow.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8533}$$", "id": "5204895"}, {"introduction": "Before a patient can undergo the final Fontan procedure, their pulmonary circulation must be able to accommodate systemic venous return without the aid of a ventricle.

This problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data and physiological assumptions are provided. I will therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe problem rests on two fundamental principles of hemodynamics: the definition of a pressure gradient and the relationship between pressure, flow, and resistance, which is analogous to Ohm's law for electrical circuits.\n\nFirst, we address the transpulmonary gradient ($\\mathrm{TPG}$). The $\\mathrm{TPG}$ is defined as the pressure drop across the pulmonary vascular bed. Mathematically, it is the difference between the mean pulmonary arterial pressure ($\\mathrm{mPAP}$) and the mean left atrial pressure ($\\mathrm{LA}$), which represents the outflow pressure of the pulmonary circuit.\n$$\n\\mathrm{TPG} = \\mathrm{mPAP} - \\mathrm{LA}\n$$\nThe problem states that for a patient with a bidirectional Glenn circulation, where there is no subpulmonary ventricle to pump blood, the superior vena cava is connected directly to the pulmonary artery. In this passive circuit, the central venous pressure ($\\mathrm{CVP}$) is effectively transmitted to the pulmonary artery. Therefore, we are given the anastomic and physiologic identity $\\mathrm{mPAP} = \\mathrm{CVP}$. Substituting this into the definition of $\\mathrm{TPG}$ yields the expression for this specific clinical scenario:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TPG} = \\mathrm{CVP} - \\mathrm{LA}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the transpulmonary gradient.\n\nSecond, we derive the expression for the indexed pulmonary vascular resistance ($PVR_i$). The general relationship for vascular resistance ($R$) is given by the pressure drop ($\\Delta P$) across a circuit divided by the volumetric flow rate ($Q$) through it: $R = \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q}$. For the pulmonary circuit, the pressure drop is the $\\mathrm{TPG}$ and the flow is the pulmonary blood flow, $Q_p$. Thus, the pulmonary vascular resistance ($PVR$) is:\n$$\nPVR = \\frac{\\mathrm{TPG}}{Q_p} = \\frac{\\mathrm{mPAP} - \\mathrm{LA}}{Q_p}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the *indexed* pulmonary vascular resistance ($PVR_i$), which normalizes the resistance to the patient's body surface area by using the indexed pulmonary blood flow ($Q_{p,i}$).\n$$\nPVR_i = \\frac{\\mathrm{mPAP} - \\mathrm{LA}}{Q_{p,i}}\n$$\nWe substitute the given physiological equivalences for this patient: $\\mathrm{mPAP} = \\mathrm{CVP}$ and the simplifying assumption of no shunts, which implies that indexed pulmonary flow equals indexed systemic flow, $Q_{p,i} = Q_{s,i}$. The derived expression for $PVR_i$ is therefore:\n$$\nPVR_i = \\frac{\\mathrm{CVP} - \\mathrm{LA}}{Q_{s,i}}\n$$\n\nNow we evaluate these expressions numerically using the provided catheterization data:\n- Central venous pressure, $\\mathrm{CVP} = 16$ mmHg.\n- Left atrial mean pressure, $\\mathrm{LA} = 7$ mmHg.\n- Indexed systemic blood flow, $Q_{s,i} = 2.5$ L/min/m$^2$.\n\nThe numerical value for the transpulmonary gradient is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TPG} = 16 \\text{ mmHg} - 7 \\text{ mmHg} = 9 \\text{ mmHg}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, $\\mathrm{TPG} = 9.00$ mmHg.\n\nThe numerical value for the indexed pulmonary vascular resistance is:\n$$\nPVR_i = \\frac{16 \\text{ mmHg} - 7 \\text{ mmHg}}{2.5 \\text{ L/min/m}^2} = \\frac{9 \\text{ mmHg}}{2.5 \\text{ L/min/m}^2} = 3.6 \\frac{\\text{mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min} \\cdot \\text{m}^2}{\\text{L}}\n$$\nThe hybrid unit $\\frac{\\text{mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min}}{\\text{L}}$ is defined as a Wood unit.

The thresholds are:\n1. $\\mathrm{TPG} \\leq 6$ mmHg\n2. $PVR_i \\leq 3.0$ Wood units $\\cdot$ m$^2$\n\nWe compare our calculated values to these thresholds:\n1. For the $\\mathrm{TPG}$: Is $9.00 \\leq 6$? This is false.\n2. For the $PVR_i$: Is $3.60 \\leq 3.0$?
