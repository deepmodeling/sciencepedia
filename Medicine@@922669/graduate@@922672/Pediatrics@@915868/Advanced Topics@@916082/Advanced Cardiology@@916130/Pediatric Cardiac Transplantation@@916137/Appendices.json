All necessary data and constants for a unique solution are provided. The problem is a standard application of fundamental principles in cardiovascular physiology.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested: first, the derivation of the formula for the pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI); second, the computation of its numerical value for the given patient data; and third, a statement on the clinical implication of the result.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the PVRI Expression**\n\nThe pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) relates the pressure drop across the pulmonary circulation to the indexed blood flow through it. We begin with the hemodynamic analog of Ohm’s law ($R = \\Delta V / I$), which states that resistance is the ratio of the pressure drop ($\\Delta P$) across a vascular bed to the blood flow ($Q$) through it.\n\nFor the pulmonary circulation, the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PVR} = \\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{pulmonary}}}{Q_p}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta P_{\\text{pulmonary}}$ is the pressure drop across the pulmonary vasculature and $Q_p$ is the pulmonary blood flow. The pressure drop is the difference between the mean pulmonary artery pressure ($\\mathrm{mPAP}$) and the left atrial pressure ($\\mathrm{LAP}$).\n$$\n\\Delta P_{\\text{pulmonary}} = \\mathrm{mPAP} - \\mathrm{LAP}\n$$\nThe problem states that the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ($\\mathrm{PCWP}$) is used as a surrogate for the left atrial pressure, so $\\mathrm{LAP} \\approx \\mathrm{PCWP}$. The problem also assumes no intracardiac shunt, meaning pulmonary blood flow ($Q_p$) is equal to systemic blood flow ($Q_s$), which is the cardiac output ($Q_t$). Thus, $Q_p = Q_t$.\n\nSubstituting these into the PVR equation gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PVR} = \\frac{\\mathrm{mPAP} - \\mathrm{PCWP}}{Q_t}\n$$\nThe pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) is the PVR normalized to the body surface area ($\\mathrm{BSA}$) to account for patient size.\n$$\n\\mathrm{PVRI} = \\mathrm{PVR} \\times \\mathrm{BSA} = \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{mPAP} - \\mathrm{PCWP}}{Q_t}\\right) \\times \\mathrm{BSA}\n$$\nThe cardiac index ($\\mathrm{CI}$) is defined as the cardiac output per unit of body surface area: $\\mathrm{CI} = \\frac{Q_t}{\\mathrm{BSA}}$. Rearranging this gives $Q_t = \\mathrm{CI} \\times \\mathrm{BSA}$. Substituting this expression for $Q_t$ into the PVRI equation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PVRI} = \\frac{\\mathrm{mPAP} - \\mathrm{PCWP}}{\\mathrm{CI} \\times \\mathrm{BSA}} \\times \\mathrm{BSA}\n$$\nThe $\\mathrm{BSA}$ terms cancel, yielding the final expression for PVRI in terms of mean pulmonary artery pressure, left atrial pressure (as PCWP), and cardiac index:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PVRI} = \\frac{\\mathrm{mPAP} - \\mathrm{PCWP}}{\\mathrm{CI}}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Computation of PVRI**\n\nTo compute the PVRI, we must first calculate the cardiac index ($\\mathrm{CI}$). This requires calculating the cardiac output ($Q_t$) using the Fick principle. The Fick principle states that whole-body oxygen consumption ($\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$) is the product of cardiac output ($Q_t$) and the arteriovenous oxygen content difference ($C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} - C_{v\\mathrm{O}_2}$).\n$$\n\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = Q_t \\times (C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} - C_{v\\mathrm{O}_2})\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the arterial ($C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2}$) and mixed venous ($C_{v\\mathrm{O}_2}$) oxygen contents. The oxygen content of blood (in $\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/dL}$) is the sum of oxygen bound to hemoglobin and oxygen dissolved in plasma.\n$$\nC_{x\\mathrm{O}_2} = (Hb \\times 1.34 \\times S_{x\\mathrm{O}_2}) + (P_{x\\mathrm{O}_2} \\times 0.0031)\n$$\nUsing the provided data:\n$Hb = 12.0\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}$, $S_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = 0.98$, $P_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = 80\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n$$\nC_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = (12.0 \\times 1.34 \\times 0.98) + (80 \\times 0.0031) = 15.7584 + 0.248 = 16.0064\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/dL}\n$$\nUsing the mixed venous data:\n$S_{v\\mathrm{O}_2} = 0.65$, $P_{v\\mathrm{O}_2} = 40\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n$$\nC_{v\\mathrm{O}_2} = (12.0 \\times 1.34 \\times 0.65) + (40 \\times 0.0031) = 10.452 + 0.124 = 10.576\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/dL}\n$$\nThe arteriovenous oxygen difference is:\n$$\nC_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} - C_{v\\mathrm{O}_2} = 16.0064 - 10.576 = 5.4304\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/dL}\n$$\nTo use this in the Fick equation, we must ensure consistent units. The cardiac output $Q_t$ is typically expressed in $\\mathrm{L/min}$. The oxygen consumption $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$ is given in $\\mathrm{mL/min}$. The oxygen content difference is in $\\mathrm{mL/dL}$. We convert the content difference from per deciliter to per liter: $1\\,\\mathrm{L} = 10\\,\\mathrm{dL}$.\n$$\nC_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} - C_{v\\mathrm{O}_2} = 5.4304\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/dL} \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{dL/L} = 54.304\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/L}\n$$\nNow, we can solve the Fick equation for cardiac output $Q_t$:\n$$\nQ_t = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}}{C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} - C_{v\\mathrm{O}_2}} = \\frac{160\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}}{54.304\\,\\mathrm{mL/L}} \\approx 2.9464\\,\\mathrm{L/min}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the cardiac index ($\\mathrm{CI}$) using the Body Surface Area ($\\mathrm{BSA} = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$):\n$$\n\\mathrm{CI} = \\frac{Q_t}{\\mathrm{BSA}} = \\frac{2.9464\\,\\mathrm{L/min}}{1.00\\,\\mathrm{m^2}} = 2.9464\\,\\mathrm{L/min/m^2}\n$$\nFinally, we use the derived formula to compute the PVRI. The units for PVRI are Wood units indexed to body surface area ($\\mathrm{WU\\cdot m^2}$), where $1\\,\\mathrm{WU} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mmHg / (L/min)}$. Our derived formula $\\mathrm{PVRI} = (\\mathrm{mPAP} - \\mathrm{PCWP}) / \\mathrm{CI}$ naturally yields these units: $\\mathrm{mmHg / (L/min/m^2)} = \\mathrm{mmHg \\cdot m^2 / (L/min)} = \\mathrm{WU\\cdot m^2}$.\nGiven $\\mathrm{mPAP} = 33\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ and $\\mathrm{PCWP} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PVRI} = \\frac{33 - 10}{2.9464} = \\frac{23}{2.9464} \\approx 7.8061\\,\\mathrm{WU\\cdot m^2}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the pulmonary vascular resistance index is $7.81\\,\\mathrm{WU\\cdot m^2}$.\n\n**Part 3: Clinical Implication**\n\nThe calculated PVRI of $7.81\\,\\mathrm{WU\\cdot m^2}$ is significantly elevated. In pediatric and adult heart transplantation, a high PVRI is a major predictor of adverse outcomes, particularly acute right ventricular failure of the donor heart. The donor right ventricle is typically not accustomed to pumping against such high resistance (afterload), which can lead to hemodynamic collapse and early graft failure. Generally, a PVRI value greater than $6\\,\\mathrm{WU\\cdot m^2}$ is considered a relative to absolute contraindication for orthotopic heart transplantation. A value this high necessitates further investigation, such as a vasoreactivity study (administering pulmonary vasodilators like nitric oxide or prostacyclin during RHC), to determine if the pulmonary hypertension is fixed or reversible. If the PVRI remains elevated despite vasodilator therapy, the risk of post-transplant right ventricular failure is very high, and alternative strategies such as medical therapy to lower pulmonary pressures, mechanical circulatory support, or a heart-lung transplant may be considered.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7.81}\n$$", "id": "5182224"}, {"introduction": "Clinical data are rarely perfect, and a key skill for the advanced practitioner is the ability to interpret and reconcile conflicting information.

All terms are standard, and the values are plausible for a patient with severe heart failure. The core of the problem lies in the discrepancy between two methods of cardiac output determination—the assumed Fick method and the thermodilution method—and the subsequent impact on derived parameters like pulmonary vascular resistance. This is a common and important clinical problem. Discrepancies between assumed (or tabulated) $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$ values and actual measured $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$ are frequent in critically ill patients, whose metabolic rates are often elevated. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to be solved. Let's verify the consistency of the provided data.\n\nThe Fick principle states that $\\text{CO} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}}{C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} - C_{v\\mathrm{O}_2}}$.\nThe arterio-venous oxygen content difference ($C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} - C_{v\\mathrm{O}_2}$) can be calculated from the given saturation and hemoglobin data. Oxygen content ($C_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$, in mL/dL) is primarily determined by oxygen bound to hemoglobin: $C_{\\mathrm{O}_2} \\approx \\text{Hb} \\times 1.36 \\times S_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$.\n- $C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} \\approx 12 \\,\\text{g/dL} \\times 1.36 \\,\\text{mL O}_2/\\text{g Hb} \\times 0.98 \\approx 16.0 \\,\\text{mL/dL}$.\n- $C_{v\\mathrm{O}_2} \\approx 12 \\,\\text{g/dL} \\times 1.36 \\,\\text{mL O}_2/\\text{g Hb} \\times 0.60 \\approx 9.79 \\,\\text{mL/dL}$.\n- $C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} - C_{v\\mathrm{O}_2} \\approx 16.0 - 9.79 = 6.21 \\,\\text{mL/dL} = 62.1 \\,\\text{mL/L}$.\n\nThe total assumed oxygen consumption is $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{assumed}} = 140 \\,\\text{mL/min/m}^2 \\times 1.20 \\,\\text{m}^2 = 168 \\,\\text{mL/min}$.\nUsing this assumed $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$ and the measured oxygen difference, the Fick CO should be:\n$\\text{CO} = \\frac{168 \\,\\text{mL/min}}{62.1 \\,\\text{mL/L}} \\approx 2.70 \\,\\text{L/min}$.\nThis calculated value ($2.70 \\,\\text{L/min}$) differs from the reported assumed Fick CO ($2.3 \\,\\text{L/min}$). However, this numerical inconsistency does not invalidate the problem's core concept. The central point is that an assumed Fick calculation yielded a CO ($2.3 \\,\\text{L/min}$) that is significantly lower than the measured thermodilution CO ($3.4 \\,\\text{L/min}$). This discrepancy itself is the key element to be analyzed. The problem is valid as it tests the understanding of how measurement errors propagate into clinical decision-making.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe question requires us to analyze the hemodynamic profile, specifically the pulmonary vascular resistance, and make a recommendation regarding heart transplantation.\n\n1.  **Calculate Baseline Hemodynamic Indices:**\n    \n    -   **Transpulmonary Gradient (TPG):** The pressure gradient driving flow across the pulmonary vasculature.\n        $$ \\text{TPG} = \\text{mPAP} - \\text{PCWP} = 25 \\,\\text{mmHg} - 15 \\,\\text{mmHg} = 10 \\,\\text{mmHg} $$\n        A TPG $\\leq 12-15 \\,\\text{mmHg}$ is generally considered normal. This value is normal.\n        \n    -   **Diastolic Pulmonary Gradient (DPG):** Helps differentiate pre-capillary from post-capillary pulmonary hypertension.\n        $$ \\text{DPG} = \\text{PAD} - \\text{PCWP} = 18 \\,\\text{mmHg} - 15 \\,\\text{mmHg} = 3 \\,\\text{mmHg} $$\n        A DPG $< 7 \\,\\text{mmHg}$ is indicative of isolated post-capillary pulmonary hypertension (i.e., \"passive\" pulmonary hypertension due to high left-sided filling pressures), whereas a DPG $\\ge 7 \\,\\text{mmHg}$ suggests a pre-capillary component. This value is normal, supporting a diagnosis of post-capillary PH.\n        \n    -   **Pulmonary Vascular Resistance Index (PVRI):** The resistance of the pulmonary vasculature, indexed to body size. It is defined as $\\text{PVRI} = \\frac{\\text{TPG}}{\\text{CI}}$, where $\\text{CI}$ is the cardiac index ($\\text{CO}/\\text{BSA}$), or equivalently $\\text{PVRI} = \\frac{\\text{TPG}}{\\text{CO}} \\times \\text{BSA}$. Units are Wood units $\\cdot$ m$^2$ ($\\text{WU} \\cdot \\text{m}^2$).\n        \n        -   **PVRI using the assumed Fick CO:**\n            $$ \\text{PVRI}_{\\text{Fick}} = \\frac{10 \\,\\text{mmHg}}{2.3 \\,\\text{L/min}} \\times 1.20 \\,\\text{m}^2 \\approx 5.22 \\,\\text{WU} \\cdot \\text{m}^2 $$\n            This value is borderline to significantly elevated. A PVRI $> 4-6 \\,\\text{WU} \\cdot \\text{m}^2$ is a relative contraindication for isolated heart transplant due to the risk of acute right ventricular (RV) failure in the donor heart.\n            \n        -   **PVRI using the thermodilution CO:** Thermodilution is generally considered a more reliable direct measurement of CO in this setting than a Fick calculation using an assumed $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$.\n            $$ \\text{PVRI}_{\\text{TD}} = \\frac{10 \\,\\text{mmHg}}{3.4 \\,\\text{L/min}} \\times 1.20 \\,\\text{m}^2 \\approx 3.53 \\,\\text{WU} \\cdot \\text{m}^2 $$\n            This value is in the acceptable range for many transplant centers (often $< 4 \\,\\text{WU} \\cdot \\text{m}^2$).\n\n2.  **Reconcile Discrepancy:**\n    The PVRI is inversely proportional to CO. The assumed Fick method yielded a CO of $2.3 \\,\\text{L/min}$, while thermodilution measured it as $3.4 \\,\\text{L/min}$. The lower CO value from the Fick method is the reason for the calculated high PVRI. This lower CO is a result of using an *assumed* $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$ of $140 \\,\\text{mL/min/m}^2$. The *actual* $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$ can be back-calculated using the more reliable thermodilution CO and the measured oxygen difference:\n    $$ \\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{actual}} = \\text{CO}_{\\text{TD}} \\times (C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} - C_{v\\mathrm{O}_2}) = 3.4 \\,\\text{L/min} \\times 62.1 \\,\\text{mL/L} \\approx 211 \\,\\text{mL/min} $$\n    $$ \\text{Indexed } \\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2, \\text{actual}} = \\frac{211 \\,\\text{mL/min}}{1.20 \\,\\text{m}^2} \\approx 176 \\,\\text{mL/min/m}^2 $$\n    The assumed $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$ ($140 \\,\\text{mL/min/m}^2$) was a significant underestimate of the patient's actual, higher metabolic state of stress from heart failure ($176 \\,\\text{mL/min/m}^2$). This underestimation led to an artificially low calculated CO and, consequently, an artificially high calculated PVRI. The normal TPG and DPG, combined with the PVRI calculated from the thermodilution CO, point towards predominantly passive, post-capillary pulmonary hypertension, not fixed pulmonary vascular disease.\n\n3.  **Analyze Vasoreactivity Testing:**\n    During the iNO challenge, we assess the reactivity of the pulmonary vasculature.\n    -   New TPG: $\\text{TPG}_{\\text{iNO}} = 22 \\,\\text{mmHg} - 14 \\,\\text{mmHg} = 8 \\,\\text{mmHg}$.\n    -   New CO: $\\text{CO}_{\\text{iNO}} = 3.8 \\,\\text{L/min}$.\n    -   New PVRI:\n        $$ \\text{PVRI}_{\\text{iNO}} = \\frac{8 \\,\\text{mmHg}}{3.8 \\,\\text{L/min}} \\times 1.20 \\,\\text{m}^2 \\approx 2.53 \\,\\text{WU} \\cdot \\text{m}^2 $$\n    The PVRI drops from $3.53$ to $2.53 \\,\\text{WU} \\cdot \\text{m}^2$ with vasodilation. This is an excellent response, demonstrating that the pulmonary vascular resistance is not fixed and is highly reversible. This finding strongly supports the feasibility of isolated heart transplantation.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The borderline PVRI derived from the assumed Fick cardiac output likely reflects underestimated cardiac output rather than fixed pulmonary vasculopathy; the normal transpulmonary gradient and diastolic gradient indicate predominantly post-capillary pulmonary hypertension. Transplantation is feasible after optimization, with confirmation using thermodilution or measured oxygen consumption, and demonstration that PVRI is acceptable with vasodilator challenge.**\n- **Justification:** This option provides a comprehensive and accurate summary of the situation. It correctly identifies the underestimated CO as the source of the high PVRI from the Fick method. It correctly interprets the normal TPG and DPG as evidence of post-capillary PH. It draws the correct conclusion that transplant is feasible, conditional on using reliable data (thermodilution or Fick with measured $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$) and the favorable vasoreactivity results, which are explicitly mentioned. This aligns perfectly with the derived analysis.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. The borderline PVRI indicates fixed, nonreactive pulmonary vascular disease, making isolated heart transplantation contraindicated regardless of the normal transpulmonary gradient; recommend combined heart–lung transplantation based on PVRI alone.**\n- **Justification:** This option is incorrect on multiple counts. It uncritically accepts the flawed PVRI value. It incorrectly labels the PVR as \"fixed\" and \"nonreactive,\" which is directly contradicted by the vasoreactivity test showing a significant drop in PVRI with iNO. It inappropriately jumps to recommending a heart-lung transplant, ignoring all a-priori contrary evidence.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Normal transmural gradients cannot coexist with borderline PVRI; the catheterization data are internally inconsistent and should be discarded, deferring any decision until repeat invasive testing without interpreting current results.**\n- **Justification:** This statement is physiologically incorrect. A normal TPG can coexist with a high PVR if the cardiac output is low ($\\text{PVR} = \\text{TPG}/\\text{CO}$). The key is not to discard the data but to interpret them correctly by identifying the unreliable measurement (the assumed Fick CO). The data set as a whole is not inconsistent but rather reveals the pitfalls of using assumed constants.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. A normal diastolic transpulmonary gradient eliminates the risk of right ventricular failure after transplant irrespective of PVRI; proceed directly to urgent isolated heart transplantation without further testing.**\n- **Justification:** This is a dangerous oversimplification. While a normal DPG is very favorable, PVRI remains a crucial determinant of post-transplant RV afterload and risk. One cannot ignore PVRI. The thermodilution and vasoreactivity data are essential and were appropriately obtained; ignoring them or the need for them is poor clinical judgment.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Initiate long-term pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy and defer transplant listing until spontaneous reduction of PVRI to less than $3 \\,\\text{Wood units}\\cdot\\text{m}^2$ without vasoreactivity testing, because vasodilator responses are not relevant to transplant feasibility.**\n- **Justification:** This is incorrect. The patient's PH is secondary to left heart failure (post-capillary), not primary PAH. Most importantly, the claim that vasodilator responses are \"not relevant to transplant feasibility\" is fundamentally wrong. Vasoreactivity testing is a critical component of the pre-transplant workup for patients with PH. Deferring listing based on a flawed calculation is also illogical.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5182238"}, {"introduction": "Following successful transplantation, the focus shifts to meticulous long-term management, particularly of the immunosuppressive regimen.

Use the following scientifically realistic parameters:\n- Baseline oral bioavailability for tacrolimus is $F_{0} = 0.25$.\n- The fraction of total tacrolimus clearance mediated by Cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A (CYP3A) is $f_{m} = 0.85$.\n- Voriconazole, a potent azole antifungal inhibitor of CYP3A and intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp), reduces CYP3A-mediated intrinsic clearance to a residual activity fraction $\\eta = 0.30$ and increases tacrolimus oral bioavailability to $F_{1} = 0.40$ due to reduced intestinal first-pass extraction.\n\nAssume the non-CYP3A clearance pathways are unaffected, and model total clearance as the sum of CYP3A-mediated and non-CYP3A-mediated components. Under inhibition, the new clearance $\\mathrm{CL}_{1}$ relative to baseline $\\mathrm{CL}_{0}$ is determined by the partitioning of pathways and the residual CYP3A activity.\n\nDerive, from first principles of linear pharmacokinetics and pathway partitioning, the multiplicative factor that should be applied to the baseline total daily tacrolimus dose to maintain the same average steady-state concentration after starting voriconazole. Then, calculate the patient’s new total daily tacrolimus dose in milligrams. Express the final dose in $\\mathrm{mg}$ and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The provided information describes a standard pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction, a common clinical scenario in transplant medicine. The parameters are realistic, and the relationships are based on established pharmacokinetic principles. The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information to derive a unique, meaningful solution. Thus, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe central objective is to adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain the same average steady-state plasma concentration ($C_{ss,avg}$) after the initiation of voriconazole. Let the baseline state be denoted by the subscript $0$ and the state with voriconazole co-administration by the subscript $1$. The condition to be met is:\n$$C_{ss,avg,0} = C_{ss,avg,1}$$\n\nAccording to the problem, for a fixed dosing interval, the average steady-state concentration is proportional to the ratio of the product of oral bioavailability ($F$) and total daily dose ($D$) to the total systemic clearance ($\\mathrm{CL}$). Let $k$ be the constant of proportionality.\n$$C_{ss,avg} = k \\frac{F \\cdot D}{\\mathrm{CL}}$$\n\nApplying this relationship to our two states:\n$$C_{ss,avg,0} = k \\frac{F_0 \\cdot D_0}{\\mathrm{CL}_0}$$\n$$C_{ss,avg,1} = k \\frac{F_1 \\cdot D_1}{\\mathrm{CL}_1}$$\n\nEquating the two concentrations to find the new dose $D_1$:\n$$k \\frac{F_0 \\cdot D_0}{\\mathrm{CL}_0} = k \\frac{F_1 \\cdot D_1}{\\mathrm{CL}_1}$$\n$$\\frac{F_0 \\cdot D_0}{\\mathrm{CL}_0} = \\frac{F_1 \\cdot D_1}{\\mathrm{CL}_1}$$\n\nSolving for the new dose, $D_1$, yields:\n$$D_1 = D_0 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{F_0}{F_1}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{CL}_1}{\\mathrm{CL}_0}\\right)$$\nThe term $\\left(\\frac{F_0}{F_1}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{CL}_1}{\\mathrm{CL}_0}\\right)$ is the multiplicative dose adjustment factor.\n\nNext, we must derive the ratio of clearances, $\\frac{\\mathrm{CL}_1}{\\mathrm{CL}_0}$, from first principles. Total clearance is modeled as the sum of clearance mediated by CYP3A enzymes and clearance via other, non-CYP3A pathways.\n$$\\mathrm{CL} = \\mathrm{CL}_{CYP3A} + \\mathrm{CL}_{non-CYP3A}$$\n\nAt baseline (state $0$), the total clearance is $\\mathrm{CL}_0$. The fraction of this clearance mediated by CYP3A is given as $f_m$.\n$$\\mathrm{CL}_{CYP3A,0} = f_m \\cdot \\mathrm{CL}_0$$\nThe clearance through non-CYP3A pathways is therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{CL}_{non-CYP3A,0} = (1 - f_m) \\cdot \\mathrm{CL}_0$$\n\nVoriconazole inhibits CYP3A activity, reducing it to a residual fraction $\\eta$. The non-CYP3A pathways are stated to be unaffected. Therefore, in state $1$:\n$$\\mathrm{CL}_{CYP3A,1} = \\eta \\cdot \\mathrm{CL}_{CYP3A,0} = \\eta \\cdot f_m \\cdot \\mathrm{CL}_0$$\n$$\\mathrm{CL}_{non-CYP3A,1} = \\mathrm{CL}_{non-CYP3A,0} = (1 - f_m) \\cdot \\mathrm{CL}_0$$\n\nThe new total clearance, $\\mathrm{CL}_1$, is the sum of these modified components:\n$$\\mathrm{CL}_1 = \\mathrm{CL}_{CYP3A,1} + \\mathrm{CL}_{non-CYP3A,1}$$\n$$\\mathrm{CL}_1 = (\\eta \\cdot f_m \\cdot \\mathrm{CL}_0) + ((1 - f_m) \\cdot \\mathrm{CL}_0)$$\nFactoring out $\\mathrm{CL}_0$:\n$$\\mathrm{CL}_1 = \\mathrm{CL}_0 \\cdot (\\eta f_m + 1 - f_m)$$\n\nThe clearance ratio is thus:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{CL}_1}{\\mathrm{CL}_0} = \\eta f_m + 1 - f_m$$\n\nSubstituting this ratio back into the equation for $D_1$, we derive the full expression for the new dose:\n$$D_1 = D_0 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{F_0}{F_1}\\right) \\cdot (\\eta f_m + 1 - f_m)$$\n\nNow, we calculate the baseline total daily dose, $D_0$. The patient has a weight of $W = 32\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ and is on a dose of $0.15\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$.\n$$D_0 = (0.15\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}) \\cdot (32\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 4.8\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$$\n\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n- Baseline bioavailability, $F_0 = 0.25$\n- New bioavailability with voriconazole, $F_1 = 0.40$\n- Fraction of clearance by CYP3A, $f_m = 0.85$\n- Residual CYP3A activity fraction, $\\eta = 0.30$\n\nFirst, calculate the dose adjustment factor:\n$$\\text{Factor} = \\left(\\frac{F_0}{F_1}\\right) \\cdot (\\eta f_m + 1 - f_m)$$\n$$\\text{Factor} = \\left(\\frac{0.25}{0.40}\\right) \\cdot ((0.30)(0.85) + 1 - 0.85)$$\n$$\\text{Factor} = (0.625) \\cdot (0.255 + 0.15)$$\n$$\\text{Factor} = (0.625) \\cdot (0.405)$$\n$$\\text{Factor} = 0.253125$$\n\nFinally, calculate the new total daily dose, $D_1$:\n$$D_1 = D_0 \\cdot \\text{Factor}$$\n$$D_1 = (4.8\\,\\mathrm{mg}) \\cdot (0.253125)$$\n$$D_1 = 1.215\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$D_1 \\approx 1.22\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.22}$$", "id": "5182178"}]}
