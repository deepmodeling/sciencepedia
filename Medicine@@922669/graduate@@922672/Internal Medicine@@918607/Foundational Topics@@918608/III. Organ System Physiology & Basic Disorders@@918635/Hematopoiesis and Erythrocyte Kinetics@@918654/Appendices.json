The solution will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Governing Model and Steady-State Relationship\n\nThe fundamental principle is the conservation of cells. We consider an arbitrary cohort of cells within an infinitesimal age interval $[a, a+\\mathrm{d}a]$ at time $t$. The number of cells in this interval is $n(a,t)\\mathrm{d}a$.\n\nSince cells age deterministically at a unit rate, the rate of change of age with respect to time for any cell is $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}a}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 1$. The change in the number of cells in the age interval $[a, a+\\mathrm{d}a]$ over a time interval $\\mathrm{d}t$ is governed by the balance of fluxes into and out of this age interval.\n\nThe total or substantial derivative of the cell density $n(a,t)$ along the characteristic line of aging is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}n}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial a} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}a}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n$$\nThe problem states there is no premature death before age $L$. This means that along the life path of a cell cohort, the number of cells is conserved. Therefore, the density along a characteristic does not change due to cell loss. This implies $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}n}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0$.\n\nSubstituting $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}a}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 1$, we obtain the governing partial differential equation (PDE), which is a form of the McKendrick-von Foerster equation with zero mortality:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n(a,t)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial n(a,t)}{\\partial a} = 0\n$$\nThis equation describes how the age distribution of RBCs evolves over time for ages $0  a  L$.\n\nNext, we analyze the system at steady state. By definition, a steady state is time-invariant, which means all partial derivatives with respect to time are zero. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = 0$. The governing PDE simplifies to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the steady-state age distribution, which we denote as $n(a)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}n(a)}{\\mathrm{d}a} = 0\n$$\nIntegrating this ODE with respect to $a$ yields:\n$$\nn(a) = C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. To determine $C$, we use the boundary condition at $a=0$. At steady state, the production rate is a constant, $P$. The boundary condition is $n(0) = P$.\n\nApplying this to our solution for $n(a)$:\n$$\nn(0) = C = P\n$$\nTherefore, the steady-state age distribution of RBCs is uniform over the lifespan:\n$$\nn(a) = P \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le a \\le L\n$$\n\nNow, we can find the total steady-state RBC count, $N$, using its definition:\n$$\nN = \\int_{0}^{L} n(a) \\, \\mathrm{d}a\n$$\nSubstituting the steady-state distribution $n(a) = P$:\n$$\nN = \\int_{0}^{L} P \\, \\mathrm{d}a\n$$\nSince $P$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\nN = P \\int_{0}^{L} 1 \\, \\mathrm{d}a = P [a]_{0}^{L} = P(L-0)\n$$\nThis yields the fundamental steady-state relationship between total cell count, production rate, and lifespan:\n$$\nN = P \\times L\n$$\nThis result is intuitively clear: the total number of cells in the system is equal to the rate of production multiplied by the average residence time (lifespan) of each cell.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nWe are given the following values for a clinically stable adult:\n- Constant production rate, $P = 2.7 \\times 10^{11}$ cells/day.\n- Fixed lifespan, $L = 115$ days.\n\nUsing the derived relationship $N = P \\times L$:\n$$\nN = (2.7 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{cells/day}) \\times (115 \\, \\text{days})\n$$\nThe units of 'days' cancel, leaving the total count in 'cells'.\n$$\nN = (2.7 \\times 115) \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{cells}\n$$\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$\n2.7 \\times 115 = 310.5\n$$\nSo, the total count is:\n$$\nN = 310.5 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{cells}\n$$\nTo express this in standard scientific notation, we write:\n$$\nN = 3.105 \\times 10^{2} \\times 10^{11} = 3.105 \\times 10^{13} \\, \\text{cells}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

Calculating the RPI is an essential skill for distinguishing between hypoproliferative anemias and those with an appropriate bone marrow response.", "problem": "A hospitalized adult with symptomatic anemia has a laboratory reticulocyte percentage of $3\\%$ and a hematocrit ($\\mathrm{Hct}$) of $0.30$. In anemia, reticulocytes are released earlier and circulate longer before maturing; the clinical laboratory provides a maturation time correction factor of $1.5$ for this degree of anemia. Assume the normal adult hematocrit is $H_{\\mathrm{norm}} = 0.45$. Using foundational definitions—that the reticulocyte percentage is the fraction of circulating red blood cells (RBC) that are reticulocytes at a given time, that anemia inflates this percentage relative to the same absolute production because total RBC mass is reduced, and that earlier release increases the time that reticulocytes remain detectable in circulation—compute the reticulocyte production index (RPI) as the anemia- and maturation-corrected reticulocyte value. Then, based on widely used internal medicine interpretation that higher values indicate an appropriately increased erythropoietic response to anemia, state whether erythropoiesis is appropriately increased. Express the RPI as a single dimensionless number and round your answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the Reticulocyte Production Index (RPI) for a patient with anemia and a clinical interpretation of the result. The validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, with all necessary data provided for a unique solution.\n\nThe provided data are:\n- Observed reticulocyte percentage, $R_{\\text{obs}} = 3\\%$. In the standard clinical calculation, the numerical value $3$ is used.\n- Patient's hematocrit, $H_{pt} = 0.30$.\n- Normal adult hematocrit, $H_{norm} = 0.45$.\n- Maturation time correction factor, $M = 1.5$.\n\nThe Reticulocyte Production Index (RPI) is a corrected value that accounts for two confounding factors in the raw reticulocyte percentage: the dilutional effect of anemia and the premature release of reticulocytes from the bone marrow. The calculation proceeds in two steps.\n\nFirst, we calculate the corrected reticulocyte percentage, $R_{\\text{corr}}$, which adjusts the observed percentage for the patient's reduced red blood cell mass. A lower hematocrit means fewer total red blood cells, so any given number of reticulocytes will constitute a larger percentage of the total. The correction normalizes the percentage to what it would be if the patient had a normal hematocrit. The formula is:\n$$R_{\\text{corr}} = R_{\\text{obs}} \\times \\frac{H_{pt}}{H_{norm}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_{\\text{corr}} = 3 \\times \\frac{0.30}{0.45} = 3 \\times \\frac{30}{45} = 3 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 2$$\nThe corrected reticulocyte percentage is thus $2\\%$.\n\nSecond, we calculate the RPI by adjusting $R_{\\text{corr}}$ for the effect of premature reticulocyte release. In response to significant anemia, the bone marrow releases reticulocytes earlier than normal. These \"shift\" reticulocytes take longer to mature in the peripheral blood, leading to their accumulation and an inflation of the reticulocyte count. The maturation time correction factor, $M$, accounts for this prolonged circulation time. A factor of $1.0$ represents a $1$-day maturation period in the blood (normal), while a factor of $1.5$ implies the average reticulocyte spends $1.5$ days in circulation before maturing. The RPI is calculated by dividing the corrected reticulocyte percentage by this factor, which effectively normalizes the production rate to a per-day basis.\n$$\\text{RPI} = \\frac{R_{\\text{corr}}}{M}$$\nSubstituting the calculated $R_{\\text{corr}}$ and the given value for $M$:\n$$\\text{RPI} = \\frac{2}{1.5} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\nAs a decimal, this value is approximately $1.333...$. The problem requires rounding to three significant figures.\n$$\\text{RPI} \\approx 1.33$$\n\nThe RPI is a dimensionless index of erythropoietic activity. An RPI value of $1$ signifies a production rate equal to the normal basal state (i.e., replacing about $1\\%$ of the red cell mass per day). In the setting of anemia, a healthy bone marrow should increase production to compensate. A value of RPI greater than $2$ (or in some contexts, $3$) is generally considered to reflect an appropriately increased erythropoietic response. Conversely, an RPI of less than $2$ in a patient with significant anemia indicates an inadequate response, suggesting a hypoproliferative state or impaired red blood cell production.\n\nIn this case, the calculated RPI is $1.33$. Since $1.33  2$, the patient's bone marrow response is inadequate for the degree of anemia.
