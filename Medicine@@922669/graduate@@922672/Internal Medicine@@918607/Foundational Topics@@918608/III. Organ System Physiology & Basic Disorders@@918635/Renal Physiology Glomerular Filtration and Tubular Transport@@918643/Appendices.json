A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the General Renal Clearance Expression**\n\nThe concept of renal clearance is founded on the principle of conservation of mass. For any substance $x$ that is removed from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in the urine, at steady state, the rate of mass removal from the plasma must equal the rate of mass excretion in the urine.\n\nThe rate of mass excretion of a substance $x$ in the urine is the product of its concentration in the urine, $U_x$, and the rate of urine formation, $V$.\n$$\n\\text{Mass Excretion Rate} = U_x \\times V\n$$\n\nThe operational definition of renal clearance for a substance $x$, denoted $C_x$, is the virtual volume of plasma that is completely cleared of that substance per unit time. Therefore, the rate of mass removal of substance $x$ from the plasma by the kidneys is the product of its clearance, $C_x$, and its concentration in the plasma, $P_x$.\n$$\n\\text{Mass Removal Rate from Plasma} = C_x \\times P_x\n$$\n\nBy the principle of conservation of mass at steady state, these two rates must be equal:\n$$\nC_x \\times P_x = U_x \\times V\n$$\n\nSolving for the clearance, $C_x$, we obtain the general expression for renal clearance:\n$$\nC_x = \\frac{U_x \\times V}{P_x}\n$$\nThis formula allows the calculation of the clearance for any substance $x$, provided its plasma concentration, urinary concentration, and the urine flow rate are known.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)**\n\nThe problem specifies that the marker, inulin (denoted by the subscript 'm' in the givens, let's use 'in' for clarity), is freely filtered at the glomerulus and is neither reabsorbed nor secreted. This is a critical property.\n\nThe rate at which inulin is filtered from the plasma into Bowman's space is the \"filtered load\" of inulin. This is the product of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the plasma concentration of inulin, $P_{\\text{in}}$.\n$$\n\\text{Filtered Load of Inulin} = \\text{GFR} \\times P_{\\text{in}}\n$$\n\nSince inulin is not reabsorbed from the tubular fluid back into the blood, and not secreted from the blood into the tubular fluid, the total amount of inulin that is filtered per unit time must be equal to the amount that is excreted in the urine per unit time.\n$$\n\\text{Excretion Rate of Inulin} = U_{\\text{in}} \\times V\n$$\nEquating the filtered load and the excretion rate for inulin:\n$$\n\\text{GFR} \\times P_{\\text{in}} = U_{\\text{in}} \\times V\n$$\nSolving for GFR:\n$$\n\\text{GFR} = \\frac{U_{\\text{in}} \\times V}{P_{\\text{in}}}\n$$\nBy comparing this equation to the general clearance formula derived in Part 1, it is evident that for a substance like inulin, its clearance is equal to the glomerular filtration rate: $\\text{GFR} = C_{\\text{in}}$.\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values into this expression to calculate the patient's GFR. The problem uses the subscript 'm' for the marker.\n-   $U_{\\mathrm{m}} = 30 \\, \\text{mg/ml}$\n-   $P_{\\mathrm{m}} = 0.5 \\, \\text{mg/ml}$\n-   $V = 1 \\, \\text{ml/min}$\n\n$$\n\\text{GFR} = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{m}} \\times V}{P_{\\mathrm{m}}} = \\frac{(30 \\, \\text{mg/ml}) \\times (1 \\, \\text{ml/min})}{0.5 \\, \\text{mg/ml}}\n$$\n\nThe units of concentration (mg/ml) cancel out, leaving the final units in ml/min, which is appropriate for a flow rate.\n$$\n\\text{GFR} = \\frac{30}{0.5} \\, \\text{ml/min}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{GFR} = 60 \\, \\text{ml/min}\n$$\nThe glomerular filtration rate for this patient is $60$ ml/min.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{60}\n$$", "id": "4894424"}, {"introduction": "After filtration, the glomerular filtrate undergoes extensive modification as it passes through the renal tubules. This practice explores a key tubular process: carrier-mediated reabsorption and its inherent limits, using glucose as the classic physiological example. By calculating the filtered load of glucose and comparing it to the tubular transport maximum ($T_{m,\\mathrm{glc}}$), you will apply the mass balance equation (Excretion = Filtration - Reabsorption) to determine if and how much glucose is excreted, a condition known as glycosuria.

Using only first principles of renal mass balance, determine the steady-state urinary glucose excretion rate. Your derivation should start from the following fundamental bases: (i) filtered load equals the product of glomerular filtration and plasma concentration, and (ii) excretion equals filtration minus tubular reabsorption minus tubular secretion, noting that glucose secretion is negligible in humans. Assume that below the onset of splay, all filtered glucose is fully reabsorbed; within the splay range, some nephrons begin to excrete glucose; and at or above $T_{m,\\mathrm{glc}}$, aggregate reabsorption cannot exceed $T_{m,\\mathrm{glc}}$. Express your final answer in $\\mathrm{mg/min}$. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the steady-state urinary glucose excretion rate based on fundamental principles of renal mass balance. The core principle governing the excretion of a substance by the kidneys, when tubular secretion is negligible, is that the excretion rate is the difference between the rate at which the substance is filtered at the glomerulus and the rate at which it is reabsorbed by the tubules.\n\nLet $E_{\\mathrm{glc}}$ be the urinary excretion rate of glucose, $L_{\\mathrm{glc}}$ be the filtered load of glucose, and $R_{\\mathrm{glc}}$ be the tubular reabsorption rate of glucose. The relationship is given by:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{glc}} = L_{\\mathrm{glc}} - R_{\\mathrm{glc}}$$\n\nThe filtered load of glucose ($L_{\\mathrm{glc}}$) is the product of the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) and the plasma concentration of glucose ($P_{\\mathrm{glc}}$).\n$$L_{\\mathrm{glc}} = \\text{GFR} \\times P_{\\mathrm{glc}}$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Glomerular Filtration Rate, $\\text{GFR} = 120\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$\n- Plasma glucose concentration, $P_{\\mathrm{glc}} = 200\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n- Transport maximum for glucose, $T_{m,\\mathrm{glc}} = 375\\,\\mathrm{mg/min}$\n- Onset of splay occurs when the filtered load reaches $300\\,\\mathrm{mg/min}$.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the filtered load of glucose. To do this, the units of GFR and $P_{\\mathrm{glc}}$ must be made compatible. The plasma glucose concentration is given in milligrams per deciliter ($\\mathrm{mg/dL}$), which we convert to milligrams per milliliter ($\\mathrm{mg/mL}$) to match the units of GFR ($\\mathrm{mL/min}$).\n$$P_{\\mathrm{glc}} = 200\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{dL}} = \\frac{200\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{100\\,\\mathrm{mL}} = 2\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{mL}}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the filtered load, $L_{\\mathrm{glc}}$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{glc}} = \\text{GFR} \\times P_{\\mathrm{glc}} = \\left(120\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{min}}\\right) \\times \\left(2\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{mL}}\\right) = 240\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{min}}$$\n\nThe next step is to determine the rate of tubular reabsorption, $R_{\\mathrm{glc}}$. The problem specifies the rules for glucose reabsorption:\n1.  Below the onset of splay, all filtered glucose is fully reabsorbed.\n2.  Splay begins when the filtered load reaches $300\\,\\mathrm{mg/min}$.\n\nWe must compare our calculated filtered load, $L_{\\mathrm{glc}} = 240\\,\\mathrm{mg/min}$, to the threshold for the onset of splay, which is a filtered load of $300\\,\\mathrm{mg/min}$.\nSince $240\\,\\mathrm{mg/min} < 300\\,\\mathrm{mg/min}$, the filtered load is below the threshold at which splay begins.\n\nAccording to the problem's explicit assumption, \"below the onset of splay, all filtered glucose is fully reabsorbed.\" This means that the rate of tubular reabsorption, $R_{\\mathrm{glc}}$, is equal to the entire filtered load.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{glc}} = L_{\\mathrm{glc}} = 240\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{min}}$$\nThis reabsorption rate is also well below the patient's transport maximum ($T_{m,\\mathrm{glc}} = 375\\,\\mathrm{mg/min}$), which is consistent.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the urinary excretion rate, $E_{\\mathrm{glc}}$, using the mass balance equation:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{glc}} = L_{\\mathrm{glc}} - R_{\\mathrm{glc}}$$\nSubstituting the values we have determined:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{glc}} = 240\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{min}} - 240\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{min}} = 0\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{min}}$$\n\nTherefore, despite the patient's hyperglycemia ($P_{\\mathrm{glc}} = 200\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$), the filtered load of glucose does not exceed the renal threshold for glucose spillage into the urine for this specific case. The urinary glucose excretion rate is zero.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "4894379"}, {"introduction": "A primary role of the kidney is the fine-tuned regulation of the body's water content, which allows for the production of either dilute or concentrated urine. This practice introduces a powerful method for quantifying this regulatory function by conceptually separating total urine flow into two distinct components. Calculating osmolar clearance ($C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$) and free-water clearance ($C_{H_2O}$) provides a quantitative tool to assess whether the kidneys are actively conserving or excreting solute-free water, offering direct insight into a patient's hydration status and the kidney's concentrating and diluting capacity [@problem_id:4894330].", "problem": "A hospitalized adult with profound water diuresis has a steady urine flow of $V=10$ milliliters per minute, urine osmolarity of $U_{\\mathrm{osm}}=100$ milliosmoles per kilogram, and plasma osmolarity of $P_{\\mathrm{osm}}=285$ milliosmoles per kilogram.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of renal physiology, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of data, and objective in its language. The provided physiological parameters are realistic for a state of water diuresis.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the required expressions from fundamental principles and then computing the numerical values.\n\n**1. Derivation of Osmolar Clearance ($C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$)**\n\nThe fundamental definition of renal clearance of any substance $x$, denoted $C_x$, is the virtual volume of plasma from which that substance is completely removed per unit time. This is mathematically expressed as:\n$$C_x = \\frac{\\dot{m}_x}{P_x}$$\nwhere $\\dot{m}_x$ is the mass excretion rate of substance $x$ and $P_x$ is its plasma concentration. The excretion rate is given by the product of the urine concentration of the substance, $U_x$, and the urine flow rate, $V$. Thus, the standard clearance formula is:\n$$C_x = \\frac{U_x V}{P_x}$$\nThis formula is an expression of the principle of mass conservation: the rate at which a substance is removed from the plasma ($C_x P_x$) must equal the rate at which it appears in the urine ($U_x V$).\n\nTo find the osmolar clearance, $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$, we apply this principle to the total quantity of osmotically active solutes (osmoles). We let the \"substance\" be the total osmoles.\nThe rate of osmole excretion is the product of the urine osmolarity, $U_{\\mathrm{osm}}$, and the urine flow rate, $V$.\n$$\\text{Rate of osmole excretion} = U_{\\mathrm{osm}} V$$\nThe plasma concentration of osmoles is the plasma osmolarity, $P_{\\mathrm{osm}}$.\nBy analogy with the general clearance formula, osmolar clearance is the volume of plasma cleared of all solutes per unit time. Therefore, we have:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{osm}} = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{osm}} V}{P_{\\mathrm{osm}}}$$\nThis expression represents the volume of water required to excrete the body's daily osmotic load in a urine that is iso-osmotic to plasma.\n\n**2. Derivation of Free-Water Clearance ($C_{H_2O}$)**\n\nThe total urine flow rate, $V$, can be conceptually divided into two components:\n1.  The volume needed to excrete the filtered solutes in a fluid that is iso-osmotic with plasma. This volume is, by definition, the osmolar clearance, $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$.\n2.  The volume of solute-free water that is added to or removed from this iso-osmotic fluid to generate the final urine of osmolarity $U_{\\mathrm{osm}}$. This volume is the free-water clearance, $C_{H_2O}$.\n\nThe conservation of volume dictates that the total urine flow is the sum of these two components:\n$$V = C_{\\mathrm{osm}} + C_{H_2O}$$\nThis equation serves as the definition for free-water clearance. By rearranging it, we can derive the expression for $C_{H_2O}$:\n$$C_{H_2O} = V - C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$$\nSubstituting the previously derived expression for $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$ gives:\n$$C_{H_2O} = V - \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{osm}} V}{P_{\\mathrm{osm}}}$$\nFactoring out $V$, we obtain the standard working formula for free-water clearance:\n$$C_{H_2O} = V \\left( 1 - \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{osm}}}{P_{\\mathrm{osm}}} \\right)$$\n\n**3. Calculation of Numerical Values**\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\n- Urine flow rate, $V = 10 \\text{ ml/min}$\n- Urine osmolarity, $U_{\\mathrm{osm}} = 100 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$\n- Plasma osmolarity, $P_{\\mathrm{osm}} = 285 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$\n\nWe note that osmolarity is technically measured in mOsm/L, while osmolality is in mOsm/kg. In dilute biological fluids like plasma and urine, the density is approximately $1$ kg/L, so these values are treated as numerically equivalent, which is a standard convention.\n\nFirst, we compute the osmolar clearance, $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{osm}} = \\frac{(100 \\text{ mOsm/kg}) \\cdot (10 \\text{ ml/min})}{285 \\text{ mOsm/kg}} = \\frac{1000}{285} \\text{ ml/min} \\approx 3.50877... \\text{ ml/min}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{osm}} = 3.51 \\text{ ml/min}$$\n\nNext, we compute the free-water clearance, $C_{H_2O}$, using the value of $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$ before rounding for better precision:\n$$C_{H_2O} = V - C_{\\mathrm{osm}} = 10 \\text{ ml/min} - 3.50877... \\text{ ml/min} = 6.49122... \\text{ ml/min}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$C_{H_2O} = 6.49 \\text{ ml/min}$$\n\n**4. Conclusion on Free Water Excretion/Reabsorption**\n\nThe sign of the free-water clearance indicates the net handling of solute-free water by the kidneys.\n- If $C_{H_2O} > 0$, the urine is hypo-osmotic compared to plasma ($U_{\\mathrm{osm}} < P_{\\mathrm{osm}}$), and there is a net excretion of free water.\n- If $C_{H_2O} < 0$, the urine is hyper-osmotic compared to plasma ($U_{\\mathrm{osm}} > P_{\\mathrm{osm}}$), and there is a net reabsorption of free water. This negative value is often denoted as $T^c_{H_2O}$, the tubular transport maximum for water reabsorption.\n- If $C_{H_2O} = 0$, the urine is iso-osmotic with plasma ($U_{\\mathrm{osm}} = P_{\\mathrm{osm}}$).\n\nIn this case, the calculated free-water clearance is $C_{H_2O} = +6.49 \\text{ ml/min}$. Since the value is positive, **free water is being excreted**.\n\nThis conclusion is justified from first principles by comparing the osmolarities. The urine ($U_{\\mathrm{osm}} = 100 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$) is significantly more dilute (hypo-osmotic) than the plasma ($P_{\\mathrm{osm}} = 285 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$). To produce a urine that is more dilute than the plasma from which it originates, the kidneys must reabsorb solute in excess of water, or equivalently, excrete water in excess of solute. This net excretion of \"solute-free water\" is precisely what a positive free-water clearance represents. The physiological state is one of water diuresis, characterized by the excretion of a large volume of dilute urine to eliminate excess water from the body.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3.51 & 6.49\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4894330"}]}
