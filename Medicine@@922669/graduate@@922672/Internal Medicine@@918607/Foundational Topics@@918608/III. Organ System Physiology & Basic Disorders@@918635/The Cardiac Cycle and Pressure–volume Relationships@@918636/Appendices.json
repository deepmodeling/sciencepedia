A solution will be derived based on a rigorous application of the provided definitions.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to compute the stroke volume ($SV$) and the ejection fraction ($EF$) from the given ventricular volumes and conceptual definitions.\n\n**1. Calculation of Stroke Volume ($SV$)**\n\nThe problem defines stroke volume as the 'net amount of blood ejected from the left ventricle during one beat'. The cardiac cycle begins with the ventricle filled to its maximum volume at the end of diastole, the end-diastolic volume ($EDV$). During systole, the ventricle contracts and ejects blood, reaching its minimum volume at the end of systole, the end-systolic volume ($ESV$).\n\nThe net volume of blood ejected is therefore the difference between the initial volume and the final volume.\n$$\nSV = EDV - ESV\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nEDV = 160 \\text{ mL}\n$$\n$$\nESV = 80 \\text{ mL}\n$$\nWe calculate the stroke volume:\n$$\nSV = 160 \\text{ mL} - 80 \\text{ mL} = 80 \\text{ mL}\n$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nSV = 80.0 \\text{ mL}\n$$\n\n**2. Calculation of Ejection Fraction ($EF$)**\n\nThe problem defines ejection fraction as 'the fraction of the end-diastolic volume that is ejected during that beat'. The volume ejected is the stroke volume, $SV$. The volume from which this ejection occurs is the end-diastolic volume, $EDV$.\n\nTherefore, the ejection fraction is the ratio of the stroke volume to the end-diastolic volume.\n$$\nEF = \\frac{SV}{EDV}\n$$\nUsing the expression for $SV$ derived above, we can write $EF$ in terms of the primary volumes:\n$$\nEF = \\frac{EDV - ESV}{EDV}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values into this expression:\n$$\nEF = \\frac{160 \\text{ mL} - 80 \\text{ mL}}{160 \\text{ mL}} = \\frac{80 \\text{ mL}}{160 \\text{ mL}}\n$$\n$$\nEF = 0.5\n$$\nThis is a dimensionless quantity, as the units of volume ($\\text{mL}$) cancel out. The problem requires this value to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nEF = 0.500\n$$\n\n**3. Assessment of Systolic Function**\n\nThe problem provides a clinical criterion: systolic function is considered preserved if the ejection fraction is greater than or equal to $0.50$.\nOur calculated ejection fraction is $EF = 0.500$. We compare this value to the criterion:\n$$\n0.500 \\ge 0.50\n$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, based on the provided data and criterion, the patient's left ventricular systolic function is preserved. This assessment completes the reasoning required by the problem.

From pressure–volume first principles, the effective arterial elastance $E_{a}$ is obtained by the ratio of end-systolic pressure to the stroke volume ejected on that beat, because $E_{a}$ represents the slope of the arterial load line relating pressure to the volume displaced into the arterial system per beat.

Ejection fraction (EF) is defined as $\\mathrm{EF} = \\dfrac{SV}{V_{ED}} = \\dfrac{V_{ED} - V_{ES}}{V_{ED}}$, where $SV$ is stroke volume, $V_{ED}$ is end-diastolic volume, and $V_{ES}$ is end-systolic volume.

It uses a standard, albeit simplified, model of ventricular-arterial coupling. The definitions are clear and sufficient to derive a unique solution. The provided numerical values are physiologically plausible. The assumptions (constant $E_{es}$ and $V_{ED}$) are standard for isolating the effects of afterload. The problem is therefore valid.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation from First Principles\n\nWe begin by formalizing the two relationships that determine the end-systolic point $(V_{ES}, P_{ES})$.\n\n1.  **The End-Systolic Pressure-Volume Relationship (ESPVR):** This describes the behavior of the ventricle at the end of systole. As given, it is a linear function:\n    $$P_{ES} = E_{es} (V_{ES} - V_0) \\quad (*)$$\n\n2.  **The Arterial Load Line:** This describes the properties of the arterial system that the ventricle ejects against. From the definition $E_a = P_{ES}/SV$ and $SV = V_{ED} - V_{ES}$, we can express $P_{ES}$ in terms of $V_{ES}$:\n    $$E_a = \\frac{P_{ES}}{V_{ED} - V_{ES}}$$\n    Rearranging gives the equation for the arterial load line:\n    $$P_{ES} = E_a (V_{ED} - V_{ES}) \\quad (**)$$\n    This is a line in the $P-V$ plane with a slope of $-E_a$ that passes through the point $(V_{ED}, 0)$.\n\n3.  **Solving for $V_{ES}$:** The end-systolic point is the intersection of these two lines. We find it by setting the expressions for $P_{ES}$ from equations $(*)$ and $(**)$ equal to each other:\n    $$E_{es} (V_{ES} - V_0) = E_a (V_{ED} - V_{ES})$$\n    We now solve for $V_{ES}$:\n    $$E_{es} V_{ES} - E_{es} V_0 = E_a V_{ED} - E_a V_{ES}$$\n    $$E_{es} V_{ES} + E_a V_{ES} = E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_0$$\n    $$V_{ES} (E_{es} + E_a) = E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_0$$\n    $$V_{ES} = \\frac{E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_0}{E_a + E_{es}}$$\n    This is the symbolic dependence of $V_{ES}$ on the other parameters.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Effect of an Increase in $E_a$:** To determine how $V_{ES}$ changes as $E_a$ changes, we take the partial derivative of $V_{ES}$ with respect to $E_a$, treating $E_{es}$, $V_{ED}$, and $V_0$ as constants. Using the quotient rule for differentiation, $\\dfrac{d}{dx}\\left(\\dfrac{u}{v}\\right) = \\dfrac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial V_{ES}}{\\partial E_a} = \\frac{(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E_a}(E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_0))(E_a + E_{es}) - (E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_0)(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E_a}(E_a + E_{es}))}{(E_a + E_{es})^2}$$\n    $$\\frac{\\partial V_{ES}}{\\partial E_a} = \\frac{(V_{ED})(E_a + E_{es}) - (E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_0)(1)}{(E_a + E_{es})^2}$$\n    $$\\frac{\\partial V_{ES}}{\\partial E_a} = \\frac{E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_{ED} - E_a V_{ED} - E_{es} V_0}{(E_a + E_{es})^2}$$\n    $$\\frac{\\partial V_{ES}}{\\partial E_a} = \\frac{E_{es} V_{ED} - E_{es} V_0}{(E_a + E_{es})^2} = \\frac{E_{es}(V_{ED} - V_0)}{(E_a + E_{es})^2}$$\n    In any physiological state, the ventricle's elastance $E_{es}$ is positive. The denominator $(E_a + E_{es})^2$ is also positive. The end-diastolic volume $V_{ED}$ must be greater than the zero-pressure volume $V_0$. Therefore, $(V_{ED} - V_0) > 0$. This means $\\dfrac{\\partial V_{ES}}{\\partial E_a} > 0$.\n    An increase in afterload ($E_a$) causes an increase in end-systolic volume ($V_{ES}$).\n\n5.  **Impact on Ejection Fraction ($\\mathrm{EF}$):** The ejection fraction is defined as $\\mathrm{EF} = 1 - \\dfrac{V_{ES}}{V_{ED}}$. Since $V_{ED}$ is held constant, an increase in $V_{ES}$ leads to an increase in the ratio $\\dfrac{V_{ES}}{V_{ED}}$, which in turn causes a decrease in $\\mathrm{EF}$.\n    Therefore, with constant contractility and preload, an acute increase in afterload causes the ejection fraction to fall. This occurs because the ventricle ejects less blood against the higher opposing pressure, leaving a larger volume behind at the end of systole.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $\\mathrm{EF}$ falls with increased $E_a$ at constant $E_{es}$ because the end-systolic intersection shifts to a higher $V_{ES}$ along the ESPVR; the intersection condition implies $V_{ES} = \\dfrac{E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_0}{E_a + E_{es}}$, so $\\dfrac{\\partial V_{ES}}{\\partial E_a} > 0$ when $V_{ED} > V_0$.**\nThis option presents a multi-part claim:\n1.  \"$\\mathrm{EF}$ falls with increased $E_a$ at constant $E_{es}$\": This matches our derivation.\n2.  \"...because the end-systolic intersection shifts to a higher $V_{ES}$...\": This is the correct mechanism, as shown by $\\dfrac{\\partial V_{ES}}{\\partial E_a} > 0$.\n3.  \"...$V_{ES} = \\dfrac{E_a V_{ED} + E_{es} V_0}{E_a + E_{es}}$\": This formula is identical to the one we derived.\n4.  \"...so $\\dfrac{\\partial V_{ES}}{\\partial E_a} > 0$ when $V_{ED} > V_0$\": This correctly identifies the condition for the positive derivative, which is always met physiologically.\nEvery part of this statement is correct and consistent with our first-principles analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $\\mathrm{EF}$ is invariant to changes in $E_a$ if $E_{es}$ is unchanged because the ESPVR slope alone determines $SV$, giving $V_{ES} = \\dfrac{E_{es} V_{ED} + E_a V_0}{E_a + E_{es}}$.**\n1.  \"$\\mathrm{EF}$ is invariant to changes in $E_a$\": This is false, as shown by the derivation. $\\mathrm{EF}$ decreases.\n2.  \"...because the ESPVR slope alone determines $SV$\": This reasoning is incorrect. $SV$ is determined by the intersection of the ventricular function (ESPVR) and the arterial load, not by the ventricular properties alone.\n3.  \"$V_{ES} = \\dfrac{E_{es} V_{ED} + E_a V_0}{E_a + E_{es}}$\": The formula is incorrect. It has improperly swapped the elastance terms in the numerator compared to the correct derivation ($E_a$ should be with $V_{ED}$ and $E_{es}$ with $V_0$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Increased $E_a$ moves the intersection to a lower $V_{ES}$ because the arterial load line rotates clockwise about $V_0$, thereby increasing $SV$ and raising $\\mathrm{EF}$.**\n1.  \"Increased $E_a$ moves the intersection to a lower $V_{ES}$\": This is false. Our derivation showed $V_{ES}$ increases.\n2.  \"...thereby increasing $SV$ and raising $\\mathrm{EF}$\": This is consequently false. $SV$ and $\\mathrm{EF}$ both decrease.\n3.  \"...because the arterial load line rotates clockwise about $V_0$\": This geometric description is incorrect. The arterial load line, $P_{ES} = E_a(V_{ED} - V_{ES})$, pivots about the point $(V_{ED}, 0)$ on the volume axis, not about $(V_0, 0)$. An increase in $E_a$ makes its slope, $-E_a$, more negative, which corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation about $(V_{ED}, 0)$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $\\mathrm{EF}$ can only fall with increased $E_a$ if preload ($V_{ED}$) simultaneously decreases; with constant $V_{ED}$ and $E_{es}$, $\\mathrm{EF}$ remains unchanged because end-systolic pressure scales proportionally to afterload.**\n1.  \"$\\mathrm{EF}$ can only fall with increased $E_a$ if preload ($V_{ED}$) simultaneously decreases\": This is false. Our derivation explicitly shows that $\\mathrm{EF}$ falls with increased $E_a$ even when $V_{ED}$ is held constant.\n2.  \"...with constant $V_{ED}$ and $E_{es}$, $\\mathrm{EF}$ remains unchanged...\": This is false and directly contradicts the analysis.\n3.  \"...because end-systolic pressure scales proportionally to afterload\": This reasoning is flawed. The relationship between $P_{ES}$ and $E_a$ is more complex and does not result in a constant $SV$ or $\\mathrm{EF}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4904302"}]}
