A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages: ($1$) checking the repeatability criteria for both $FEV_1$ and $FVC$, ($2$) selecting the best values for $FEV_1$ and $FVC$, and ($3$) calculating the final $\\frac{FEV_1}{FVC}$ ratio.\n\nFirst, we evaluate the repeatability of the $FEV_1$ measurements. The three recorded values are $2.30 \\text{ L}$, $2.42 \\text{ L}$, and $2.36 \\text{ L}$. To apply the ATS/ERS criterion, we identify the two largest values from this set.\nLet the ordered set of $FEV_1$ values be $S_{FEV_1} = \\{2.30, 2.36, 2.42\\}$.\nThe two largest values are $V_{FEV_1,\\text{max1}} = 2.42 \\text{ L}$ and $V_{FEV_1,\\text{max2}} = 2.36 \\text{ L}$.\nThe absolute difference, $\\Delta V_{FEV_1}$, between these two values is:\n$$\\Delta V_{FEV_1} = |V_{FEV_1,\\text{max1}} - V_{FEV_1,\\text{max2}}| = |2.42 - 2.36| = 0.06 \\text{ L}$$\nThe repeatability criterion requires this difference to be no more than $0.150 \\text{ L}$. The comparison is:\n$$0.06 \\text{ L} \\le 0.150 \\text{ L}$$\nThis inequality is true. Thus, the $FEV_1$ measurements meet the repeatability criterion.\n\nSecond, we evaluate the repeatability of the $FVC$ measurements. The three recorded values are $3.60 \\text{ L}$, $3.72 \\text{ L}$, and $3.64 \\text{ L}$.\nLet the ordered set of $FVC$ values be $S_{FVC} = \\{3.60, 3.64, 3.72\\}$.\nThe two largest values are $V_{FVC,\\text{max1}} = 3.72 \\text{ L}$ and $V_{FVC,\\text{max2}} = 3.64 \\text{ L}$.\nThe absolute difference, $\\Delta V_{FVC}$, between these two values is:\n$$\\Delta V_{FVC} = |V_{FVC,\\text{max1}} - V_{FVC,\\text{max2}}| = |3.72 - 3.64| = 0.08 \\text{ L}$$\nThe repeatability criterion requires this difference to be no more than $0.150 \\text{ L}$. The comparison is:\n$$0.08 \\text{ L} \\le 0.150 \\text{ L}$$\nThis inequality is also true. Thus, the $FVC$ measurements meet the repeatability criterion.\n\nSince both $FEV_1$ and $FVC$ measurements meet their respective repeatability criteria, we proceed to determine the reported values. According to the stated standard, the reported (best) value for each parameter is the largest observed value from the set of acceptable maneuvers.\n\nFor $FEV_1$, the largest value, which we denote $V_{FEV_1,\\text{best}}$, is:\n$$V_{FEV_1,\\text{best}} = \\max(\\{2.30, 2.42, 2.36\\}) = 2.42 \\text{ L}$$\nFor $FVC$, the largest value, which we denote $V_{FVC,\\text{best}}$, is:\n$$V_{FVC,\\text{best}} = \\max(\\{3.60, 3.72, 3.64\\}) = 3.72 \\text{ L}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the reported $\\frac{FEV_1}{FVC}$ ratio, denoted as $R$, using these best values.

A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the tasks set forth in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we compute the percent predicted values for FEV1 and FVC.

The standard algorithm for spirometry interpretation involves a stepwise assessment.\n1.  **Assess for an obstructive pattern:** An obstructive defect is defined by a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio. The criterion is whether the measured ratio is below the Lower Limit of Normal (LLN) for the patient's demographic.\n    - Measured FEV1/FVC ratio $\\approx 0.5294$.\n    - LLN for FEV1/FVC ratio = $0.67$.\n    - Since $0.5294  0.67$, an obstructive pattern is present.\n\n2.  **Assess for a restrictive pattern:** A restrictive pattern is suggested by a reduced Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). The standard threshold for this is an FVC below $80\\%$ of the predicted value (or below the FVC LLN, if available).\n    - FVC percent predicted = $0.85$, or $85\\%$.\n    - Since $85\\% \\ge 80\\%$, the FVC is within the normal range. Therefore, there is no evidence of a restrictive pattern from spirometry. (A definitive diagnosis of restriction would require measurement of Total Lung Capacity, TLC, via plethysmography, but based on spirometry alone, restriction is not present).\n\n3.  **Synthesize the findings:** The patient has an FEV1/FVC ratio below the LLN (indicating obstruction) and a normal FVC percent predicted (no evidence of restriction). Therefore, the ventilatory pattern is classified as **obstructive**.\n\nFourth, we determine the severity of the obstructive defect.

Let us define new variables for this linear relationship: let $y = r(C)$ and $x = \\log_{10}(C)$.

Let this target point be $(x_{20}, y_{20})$, where $y_{20} = 0.20$ and $x_{20} = \\log_{10}(\\mathrm{PC20})$.\n\nWe can use the two-point form of a linear equation to relate the three points:\n$$ \\frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$\nWe want to find the value of $x$ (which is $x_{20}$) that corresponds to $y = y_{20} = 0.20$. We can substitute $(x_{20}, y_{20})$ into the equation and solve for $x_{20}$. This procedure is known as linear interpolation.\n$$ \\frac{y_{20} - y_1}{x_{20} - x_1} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$\nRearranging to solve for $x_{20}$:\n$$ x_{20} - x_1 = (y_{20} - y_1) \\frac{x_2 - x_1}{y_2 - y_1} $$\n$$ x_{20} = x_1 + (y_{20} - y_1) \\frac{x_2 - x_1}{y_2 - y_1} $$\nNow, we substitute back the original variable definitions:\n$$ \\log_{10}(\\mathrm{PC20}) = \\log_{10}(C_1) + (0.20 - r(C_1)) \\frac{\\log_{10}(C_2) - \\log_{10}(C_1)}{r(C_2) - r(C_1)} $$\nSubstitute the given numerical values:\n$$ \\log_{10}(\\mathrm{PC20}) = \\log_{10}(2) + (0.20 - 0.12) \\frac{\\log_{10}(4) - \\log_{10}(2)}{0.24 - 0.12} $$\nLet's simplify the expression.
