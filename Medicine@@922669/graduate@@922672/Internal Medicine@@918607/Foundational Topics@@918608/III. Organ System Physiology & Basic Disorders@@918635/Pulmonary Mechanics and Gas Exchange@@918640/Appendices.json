The analysis is based on the single-compartment linear model of respiratory mechanics for a passive patient, which is described by the equation of motion:\n$$P_{airway}(t) = R_{aw} \\dot{V}(t) + \\frac{1}{C_{rs}} V(t) + P_{EE, total}$$\nwhere $P_{airway}(t)$ is the pressure at the airway opening, $\\dot{V}(t)$ is the instantaneous airflow, $V(t)$ is the volume delivered above the end-expiratory level, and $P_{EE, total}$ is the total positive end-expiratory pressure.\n\nThe data are obtained during volume-controlled ventilation with a constant inspiratory flow, which simplifies the analysis.\n\nFirst, we must ensure all units are consistent. The target units are mL/cmH$_2$O for compliance and cmH$_2$O·s/L for resistance.\nThe given inspiratory flow is $\\dot{V} = 60$ L/min. To convert this to L/s, we use the conversion factor $1 \\text{ min} = 60 \\text{ s}$:\n$$\\dot{V} = 60 \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{min}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ min}}{60 \\text{ s}} = 1 \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{s}}$$\n\n**1. Calculation of Static Compliance ($C_{rs}$)**\n\nStatic compliance is defined as the change in volume per unit change in static pressure.\n$$C_{rs} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta P_{static}}$$\nThe relevant measurements for this calculation are taken under static (zero-flow) conditions.\n\nThe change in volume, $\\Delta V$, is the tidal volume ($V_T$) delivered to the lungs. The problem provides a target inspiratory tidal volume of $500$ mL and a measured exhaled tidal volume of $480$ mL. Given that there is \"no leak\", the exhaled tidal volume, $V_{T, exhaled}$, is the most accurate measure of the volume that actually participated in gas exchange and distended the respiratory system. The difference between set and exhaled volume is typically due to gas compression within the ventilator circuit. Therefore, we use $\\Delta V = V_{T, exhaled} = 480$ mL.\n\nThe change in static pressure, $\\Delta P_{static}$, is the difference between the alveolar pressure at end-inspiration and the alveolar pressure at end-expiration.\n- The static pressure at end-inspiration is measured during an end-inspiratory hold maneuver, where flow is zero. This pressure is the plateau pressure, $P_{plat} = 22$ cmH$_2$O.\n- The static pressure at end-expiration is measured during an end-expiratory hold maneuver. This pressure is the total positive end-expiratory pressure, $P_{EE, total} = 9$ cmH$_2$O. This value includes the set PEEP ($5$ cmH$_2$O) and any intrinsic PEEP (auto-PEEP).\n\nThus, the change in static pressure is:\n$$\\Delta P_{static} = P_{plat} - P_{EE, total} = 22 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O} - 9 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O} = 13 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the static compliance:\n$$C_{rs} = \\frac{V_{T, exhaled}}{P_{plat} - P_{EE, total}} = \\frac{480 \\text{ mL}}{13 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O}} \\approx 36.923... \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{cmH}_2\\text{O}}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $C_{rs} = 36.9$ mL/cmH$_2$O.\n\n**2.

It can be calculated from the difference between the peak inspiratory pressure ($P_{peak}$) and the plateau pressure ($P_{plat}$).\n\n- $P_{peak}$ is the maximum pressure reached during inspiration, and it reflects both the pressure needed to overcome resistance and the pressure needed to distend the elastic components of the respiratory system.\n$P_{peak} = (R_{aw} \\dot{V}) + P_{elastic}$\n- $P_{plat}$ is the pressure measured at end-inspiration under zero-flow conditions, reflecting only the elastic recoil pressure at that volume.\n$P_{plat} = P_{elastic}$\n\nTherefore, the resistive pressure drop is:\n$$\\Delta P_{resistive} = P_{peak} - P_{plat}$$\nUsing the given values:\n$$\\Delta P_{resistive} = 30 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O} - 22 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O} = 8 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O}$$\nThe airflow, $\\dot{V}$, during which this pressure drop occurs is the constant inspiratory flow, which we previously converted to $1$ L/s.\n\nNow, we can calculate the airway resistance:\n$$R_{aw} = \\frac{P_{peak} - P_{plat}}{\\dot{V}} = \\frac{8 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O}}{1 \\text{ L/s}} = 8 \\frac{\\text{cmH}_2\\text{O} \\cdot \\text{s}}{\\text{L}}$$\nExpressing this to three significant figures gives $R_{aw} = 8.00$ cmH$_2$O·s/L.\n\nIn summary, the static compliance of the respiratory system is $36.9$ mL/cmH$_2$O and the airway resistance is $8.00$ cmH$_2$O·s/L.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n36.9 & 8.00\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4891278"}, {"introduction": "While static compliance provides a valuable snapshot of lung distensibility, it is not a fixed constant, particularly in evolving diseases like Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The pressure-volume relationship of the ARDS lung is often non-linear, and understanding how compliance changes with ventilator settings is critical for providing lung-protective ventilation.

All provided data are consistent and physically realistic for the described clinical scenario. The analysis will proceed by applying the fundamental definition of static respiratory system compliance.\n\nStatic compliance of the respiratory system, denoted as $C_{rs}$, is a measure of the system's distensibility. It is defined as the change in volume ($\\Delta V$) per unit change in distending pressure ($\\Delta P$) under static conditions (i.e., at zero airflow). The relationship is given by:\n$$C_{rs} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta P}$$\nIn the context of mechanical ventilation, the change in volume, $\\Delta V$, is the delivered tidal volume, $V_T$. The change in static pressure, $\\Delta P$, is the difference between the pressure at the end of inspiration and the pressure at the end of expiration. The plateau pressure, $P_{plat}$, is measured during an end-inspiratory hold, representing the static elastic recoil pressure of the respiratory system at the end-tidal volume. The pressure at the end of expiration is the positive end-expiratory pressure, $PEEP$. Therefore, the static driving pressure is $\\Delta P = P_{plat} - PEEP$.\n\nThe formula for calculating static compliance is:\n$$C_{rs} = \\frac{V_T}{P_{plat} - PEEP}$$\n\nThe problem requires calculating the change in compliance, $\\Delta C_{rs}$, between a baseline state (State $1$) and a post-adjustment state (State $2$).\n$$\\Delta C_{rs} = C_{rs2} - C_{rs1}$$\n\nFirst, we will calculate the parameters and compliance for the baseline state (State $1$).\nThe predicted body weight ($PBW$) is $70$ kilograms.\nThe baseline tidal volume setting is $6$ milliliters per kilogram $PBW$.\n$$V_{T1} = 6 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg}} \\times 70 \\text{ kg} = 420 \\text{ mL}$$\nThe measured baseline plateau pressure is $P_{plat1} = 24$ centimeters of water ($\\text{cmH}_2\\text{O}$).\nThe set PEEP is $PEEP_1 = 10 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O}$.\n\nThe static compliance at baseline is:\n$$C_{rs1} = \\frac{V_{T1}}{P_{plat1} - PEEP_1} = \\frac{420 \\text{ mL}}{24 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O} - 10 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O}} = \\frac{420 \\text{ mL}}{14 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O}} = 30 \\text{ mL/cmH}_2\\text{O}$$\n\nNext, we will calculate the parameters and compliance for the post-adjustment state (State $2$).\nThe new tidal volume setting is $7$ milliliters per kilogram $PBW$.\n$$V_{T2} = 7 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg}} \\times 70 \\text{ kg} = 490 \\text{ mL}$$\nThe measured plateau pressure after adjustment is $P_{plat2} = 30 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O}$.\nThe PEEP is kept constant, so $PEEP_2 = 10 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O}$.\n\nThe static compliance after the adjustment is:\n$$C_{rs2} = \\frac{V_{T2}}{P_{plat2} - PEEP_2} = \\frac{490 \\text{ mL}}{30 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O} - 10 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O}} = \\frac{490 \\text{ mL}}{20 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O}} = 24.5 \\text{ mL/cmH}_2\\text{O}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the signed change in static respiratory system compliance, $\\Delta C_{rs}$.\n$$\\Delta C_{rs} = C_{rs2} - C_{rs1} = 24.5 \\text{ mL/cmH}_2\\text{O} - 30 \\text{ mL/cmH}_2\\text{O} = -5.5 \\text{ mL/cmH}_2\\text{O}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\Delta C_{rs} = -5.500 \\text{ mL/cmH}_2\\text{O}$$\n\nThe clinical interpretation of this result is significant. The static compliance has decreased. A lower compliance indicates that the respiratory system has become \"stiffer\"—it requires more pressure to inflate the lungs with a given volume of air. In ARDS, the pressure-volume curve is complex. While the problem assumes a \"quasi-linear\" range, this calculation reveals that the system is not perfectly linear. The decrease in compliance from $30$ to $24.5 \\text{ mL/cmH}_2\\text{O}$ upon increasing the tidal volume suggests that the additional volume is moving the lung from a more compliant region of its pressure-volume curve to a less compliant one. This is characteristic of reaching the upper inflection point of the sigmoid curve, which corresponds to alveolar overdistension. This is a critical warning sign that the increased tidal volume may be causing or exacerbating lung injury (volutrauma and barotrauma), even though the absolute plateau pressure is still at the common threshold of $30 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O}$. The substantial increase in driving pressure (from $14$ to $20 \\text{ cmH}_2\\text{O}$) to achieve a relatively small increase in tidal volume strongly supports this interpretation and would prompt a clinician to reduce the tidal volume to a more protective level.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-5.500}$$", "id": "4891275"}, {"introduction": "After assessing the mechanical properties of the lungs, the next step is to evaluate their primary function: gas exchange.

This is the partial pressure of oxygen in the air after it has been humidified in the upper airways.

However, hypoxia typically stimulates ventilation, leading to a *low* $PaCO_2$. The patient's high $PaCO_2$ indicates another process is dominant.\n-   **Alveolar hypoventilation (Code 1)**: This is defined by an elevated $PaCO_2$. In \"pure\" alveolar hypoventilation, the increase in alveolar $CO_2$ displaces oxygen, lowering both $PAO_2$ and $PaO_2$. A key characteristic is that the A-a gradient remains normal. The patient's data show a high $PaCO_2$ ($55\\,\\text{mm Hg}$) and a normal A-a gradient ($7.78\\,\\text{mm Hg}$).

Since the patient's A-a gradient is normal, these mechanisms are not the primary cause of the hypoxemia.\n\nBased on this analysis, the combination of a normal A-a gradient and a high $PaCO_2$ is the classic signature of alveolar hypoventilation.
