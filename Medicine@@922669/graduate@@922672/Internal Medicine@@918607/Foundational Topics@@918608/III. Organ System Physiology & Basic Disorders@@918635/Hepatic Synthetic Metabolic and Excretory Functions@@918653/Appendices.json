The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Steady-State Concentration Expression\nThe problem is approached from first principles using a mass balance on the amount of bilirubin in the plasma compartment. Let $M(t)$ be the total mass of bilirubin in the plasma compartment at time $t$. The rate of change of this mass, $\\frac{dM}{dt}$, is the difference between the rate of production and the rate of elimination.\n\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = \\text{Rate of Production} - \\text{Rate of Elimination}\n$$\n\nThe rate of production, $R_{\\mathrm{prod}}$, is given as a constant value.\nThe rate of elimination, $R_{\\mathrm{elim}}$, is determined by the hepatic clearance, $CL_{\\mathrm{H}}$. By definition, clearance is the volume of plasma from which a substance is completely removed per unit time. The rate of elimination is the product of the clearance and the plasma concentration of the substance, $C(t)$. This assumes linear, first-order kinetics.\n\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{elim}} = CL_{\\mathrm{H}} \\times C(t)\n$$\n\nSubstituting these rates into the mass balance equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = R_{\\mathrm{prod}} - CL_{\\mathrm{H}} \\times C(t)\n$$\n\nThe total mass $M(t)$ is related to the concentration $C(t)$ by the volume of distribution of the compartment, $V$.\n$$\nM(t) = V \\times C(t)\n$$\n\nAssuming the volume $V$ is constant, we can write the mass balance in terms of concentration:\n$$\n\\frac{d(V \\cdot C(t))}{dt} = V \\frac{dC}{dt} = R_{\\mathrm{prod}} - CL_{\\mathrm{H}} \\times C(t)\n$$\n\nAt steady state, the system is in equilibrium, meaning the concentration of bilirubin is constant. Let this steady-state concentration be $C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$. By definition of a steady state, the rate of change of concentration is zero.\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0\n$$\n\nSubstituting this condition into the differential equation yields:\n$$\n0 = R_{\\mathrm{prod}} - CL_{\\mathrm{H}} \\times C_{\\mathrm{ss}}\n$$\n\nThis equation embodies the principle that at steady state, the rate of production equals the rate of elimination:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{prod}} = CL_{\\mathrm{H}} \\times C_{\\mathrm{ss}}\n$$\n\nSolving for the steady-state concentration $C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ gives the required expression:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{prod}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{H}}}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\n### Calculation of the New Steady-State Concentration\nFollowing the acute cholestatic insult, the hepatic clearance is reduced to a new value, $CL_{\\mathrm{H,new}} = 9$ L/day, while the production rate remains $R_{\\mathrm{prod}} = 250$ mg/day. We use the derived formula to calculate the new steady-state concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{ss,new}}$.\n\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{ss,new}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{prod}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{H,new}}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{ss,new}} = \\frac{250 \\text{ mg/day}}{9 \\text{ L/day}}\n$$\n\nThe calculation yields the concentration in units of mg/L:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{ss,new}} = \\frac{250}{9} \\text{ mg/L}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be in units of mg/dL. We must perform a unit conversion. Knowing that $1$ L = $10$ dL, we can write the conversion factor:\n$$\n\\frac{1 \\text{ L}}{10 \\text{ dL}} = 1\n$$\n\nMultiplying the result by this conversion factor:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{ss,new}} = \\frac{250}{9} \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ L}}{10 \\text{ dL}} = \\frac{250}{90} \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}} = \\frac{25}{9} \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{ss,new}} = 2.7777... \\text{ mg/dL}\n$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{ss,new}} \\approx 2.778 \\text{ mg/dL}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.778}$$", "id": "4846201"}, {"introduction": "We now turn to the liver's vital synthetic functions, exemplified by its production of coagulation factors.

The dominant role of Factor VII is correctly represented. The numerical values for factor activities, ISI, and control PT are all within realistic clinical ranges. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and requires non-trivial reasoning to connect the kinetic model to the clinical measurement. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe core principle connecting the kinetic model to the Prothrombin Time ($PT$) is that the time required to reach a specific endpoint (clot formation) is inversely proportional to the overall rate of the reaction.
