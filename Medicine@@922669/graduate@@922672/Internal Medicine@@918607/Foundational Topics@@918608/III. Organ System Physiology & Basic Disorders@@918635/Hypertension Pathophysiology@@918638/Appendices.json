A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem consists of two parts: first, calculating the patient's initial baseline mean arterial pressure ($MAP$), and second, determining the long-term steady-state change in $MAP$ after a specified chronic intervention.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Initial Mean Arterial Pressure**\n\nThe mean arterial pressure ($MAP$) is given by the product of cardiac output ($CO$) and total peripheral resistance ($TPR$).\n$$\nMAP = CO \\times TPR\n$$\nCardiac output is the product of heart rate ($HR$) and stroke volume ($SV$).\n$$\nCO = HR \\times SV\n$$\nWe are given:\n- $HR = 75 \\text{ beats/min}$\n- $SV = 80 \\text{ mL/beat}$\n- $TPR = 18 \\text{ mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we must ensure consistent units.

We convert $SV$ to liters.\n$$\nSV = 80 \\text{ mL/beat} = 0.080 \\text{ L/beat}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the cardiac output ($CO$).\n$$\nCO = (75 \\text{ beats/min}) \\times (0.080 \\text{ L/beat}) = 6.0 \\text{ L/min}\n$$\nWith the cardiac output calculated, we can determine the initial mean arterial pressure ($MAP_{initial}$).\n$$\nMAP_{initial} = (6.0 \\text{ L/min}) \\times (18 \\text{ mmHg} \\cdot \\text{min} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}) = 108 \\text{ mmHg}\n$$\nThe patient's initial mean arterial pressure is $108 \\text{ mmHg}$.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Long-Term Steady-State Change in Mean Arterial Pressure**\n\nThis part of the problem assesses the understanding of long-term blood pressure regulation. The crucial premises are:\n1.  \"In the long term, the circulatory system reaches a new steady state determined by renal-fluid balance.\"\n2.  \"Sodium intake and renal function are unchanged.\"\n\nThis framework describes the pressure-natriuresis mechanism, a central concept in the long-term control of arterial pressure. According to this model, the body's fluid volume, and thus blood pressure, is maintained at a steady state where the rate of fluid intake equals the rate of fluid excretion by the kidneys. The relationship between arterial pressure and renal water/salt excretion is described by the \"renal function curve\" or \"pressure-natriuresis curve.\" The long-term equilibrium point for $MAP$ is the pressure at which the renal output of salt and water precisely matches the net intake.\n\nThe problem states that both \"Sodium intake\" and \"renal function\" are unchanged. This means neither the intake rate (a constant value) nor the renal function curve (a function of pressure) has shifted. Therefore, the intersection point of the intake line and the renal function curve, which defines the long-term steady-state $MAP$, remains fixed.\n\nLet's consider the effect of the intervention: an isolated, sustained reduction of $HR$, $SV$, or $TPR$ by $20\\%$. For example, if $TPR$ is reduced, the immediate effect is a drop in $MAP$ since $MAP = CO \\times TPR$. However, this lower $MAP$ reduces renal excretion of salt and water (moving to a lower point on the fixed renal function curve). Because intake is unchanged, this leads to a net retention of fluid, an expansion of blood volume, and a consequent rise in cardiac output (via the Frank-Starling mechanism). This process continues until $MAP$ returns to the original equilibrium set point, at which renal output once again balances the fixed intake. At the new long-term steady state, $TPR$ is lower, but $CO$ is higher, such that their product, the $MAP$, is restored to its original value.\n\nThe same logic applies to an isolated reduction in $HR$ or $SV$. An initial drop in $CO$ and $MAP$ would trigger renal fluid retention, leading to an increase in blood volume that compensates for the initial perturbation and restores $MAP$ to the original set point.\n\nTherefore, despite the initial change in hemodynamics, the long-term steady-state mean arterial pressure must return to its original value, $MAP_{initial} = 108 \\text{ mmHg}$, because the fundamental determinants of long-term pressure (renal function and fluid intake) are unchanged.\n\nThe question asks for the steady-state change in mean arterial pressure from the original baseline.\n$$\n\\Delta MAP_{steady-state} = MAP_{final} - MAP_{initial}\n$$\nSince $MAP_{final} = MAP_{initial}$, the change is zero.\n$$\n\\Delta MAP_{steady-state} = 108 \\text{ mmHg} - 108 \\text{ mmHg} = 0 \\text{ mmHg}\n$$\nThe steady-state change in mean arterial pressure is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "4849059"}, {"introduction": "Having established the primacy of the renal-fluid system in long-term pressure control, we now quantify its behavior.

The problem is objective and free from ambiguity. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe core principle governing long-term arterial pressure regulation in this context is that the body must maintain sodium balance. In a steady-state condition, the rate of sodium excretion by the kidneys, $N_{out}$, must equal the rate of sodium intake from the diet, $N_{in}$.\n$$\nN_{out} = N_{in}\n$$\nThe problem provides a baseline steady-state operating point, characterized by an initial sodium intake $N_{0} = 60 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/day}$ and a corresponding mean arterial pressure (MAP) $P_{0} = 95 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. At this point, the initial excretion rate, which we can denote as $N_{out,0}$, must be equal to the intake rate $N_{0}$.\n$$\nN_{out,0} = N_{0} = 60 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/day}\n$$\nThe relationship between renal sodium excretion and MAP is known as pressure natriuresis. The problem states that near the operating point $(P_{0}, N_{0})$, this relationship can be approximated as a linear function. The general form of a linear function relating sodium excretion ($N_{out}$) to MAP ($P$) is:\n$$\nN_{out}(P) = N_{ref} + S \\cdot (P - P_{ref})\n$$\nwhere $S$ is the slope of the line and $(P_{ref}, N_{ref})$ is any known point on the line. We are given the slope $S = 0.5 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/day/mmHg}$ and the baseline operating point $(P_{0}, N_{0})$, which we can use as our reference point. Thus, the specific equation for the pressure-natriuresis curve for this individual is:\n$$\nN_{out}(P) = N_{0} + S \\cdot (P - P_{0})\n$$\nNext, the patient's dietary sodium intake increases by $20\\%$.

The definitions of resistant hypertension and ABPM thresholds are consistent with major clinical guidelines (e.g., from the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology). The principles of cuff sizing and pharmacokinetics are fundamental to clinical measurement and pharmacology, respectively. The drug half-lives are clinically appropriate approximations.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant**: The problem is a formal clinical reasoning scenario, directly relevant to the pathophysiology and management of hypertension.\n3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The setup is complete and self-contained. For each patient, it provides the necessary data (office BP, ABPM, cuff biometrics, pharmacokinetic testing results) to evaluate the differential diagnosis.\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The patient scenarios are highly realistic and represent common clinical challenges in evaluating uncontrolled hypertension.\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The problem is well-posed.

A unique best answer can be determined.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological**: The problem is not trivial. It requires the synthesis of four distinct types of clinical data (office measurement, ambulatory measurement, biometric data, and lab data) to arrive at a conclusion, testing a nuanced understanding of the topic.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: All aspects of the problem are verifiable through established medical principles and clinical evidence.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The scenario is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, providing a sufficient basis for a rigorous solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe core task is to identify the patient with true resistant hypertension. According to the provided definition, this requires demonstrating that their blood pressure remains elevated despite being on an appropriate three-drug regimen. To establish this, we must systematically exclude the three major forms of \"pseudoresistance\":\n1.  **White-coat effect**: High office BP but normal out-of-office BP. This is assessed using the ABPM data. If ABPM values are below the hypertensive thresholds, a white-coat effect is likely.\n2.  **Measurement error**: Artifactually high office BP due to improper technique. The problem highlights cuff undersizing ($w/c \\ll 0.4$) as a specific cause.\n3.  **Poor adherence**: The patient is not taking the medication as prescribed. This is assessed via pharmacokinetic testing and, if available, other data like pharmacy refill history.\n\nBefore evaluating the patients, let's analyze the expected drug levels at the $t=24$ hour sampling time using the provided formula $f(t) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{t/t_{1/2}}$.\n*   **Amlodipine ($t_{1/2} \\approx 40$ h)**: At $t=24$ h, the fraction remaining is $f(24) = (\\frac{1}{2})^{24/40} = (\\frac{1}{2})^{0.6} \\approx 0.66$. A substantial amount should be present.\n*   **Chlorthalidone ($t_{1/2} \\approx 50$ h)**: At $t=24$ h, the fraction remaining is $f(24) = (\\frac{1}{2})^{24/50} = (\\frac{1}{2})^{0.48} \\approx 0.72$. A substantial amount should be present.\n*   **Valsartan ($t_{1/2} \\approx 6$ h)**: At $t=24$ h, the fraction remaining is $f(24) = (\\frac{1}{2})^{24/6} = (\\frac{1}{2})^4 = 0.0625$. Only $6.25\\%$ of the peak concentration from the last dose is expected to remain. This is a small amount, and a qualitative urine screen could plausibly be negative even in a fully adherent patient. Therefore, a negative valsartan test at $24$ hours is weak evidence for non-adherence.\n\nNow, we evaluate each patient's profile.\n\n#### Option A\n*   **Office BP**: $158/96$ mm Hg (Hypertensive).\n*   **Measurement Error**: The cuff bladder width to arm circumference ratio is $w/c = 9/34 \\approx 0.26$. This is significantly less than the ideal of $0.4$, indicating an **undersized cuff**. This is a known cause of artifactually high BP readings. This strongly suggests measurement error contributed to the high office BP.\n*   **White-Coat Effect**: The ABPM results are all within the normal range: $24$-hour mean $124/76$ mm Hg (below $130/80$), daytime mean $128/78$ mm Hg (below $135/85$), and nighttime mean $110/64$ mm Hg (below $120/70$). The discrepancy between the high office BP and normal ABPM is the definition of **white-coat effect**.\n*   **Adherence**: Amlodipine and chlorthalidone are detectable as expected. The negative valsartan test is pharmacokinetically plausible. No evidence of non-adherence.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This patient's high office BP is fully explained by a combination of measurement error and white-coat effect. This is a classic case of pseudoresistance, not true resistant hypertension.\n\n#### Option B\n*   **Office BP**: $160/100$ mm Hg (Hypertensive).\n*   **Measurement Error**: The cuff ratio is $w/c = 13/32 \\approx 0.41$. This is ideal. Measurement error due to cuff size is **ruled out**.\n*   **White-Coat Effect**: The ABPM results are all hypertensive: $24$-hour mean $138/88$ mm Hg (above $130/80$), daytime mean $144/92$ mm Hg (above $135/85$), and nighttime mean $130/82$ mm Hg (above $120/70$). This confirms sustained hypertension and **rules out a white-coat effect**.\n*   **Adherence**: Plasma levels of the long-acting drugs (amlodipine, chlorthalidone) are stable and consistent with steady-state dosing, suggesting good adherence. Most critically, a repeat ABPM performed after **directly observed therapy (DOT)** still shows significant hypertension. DOT provides definitive proof of adherence for that dosing interval. The persistence of hypertension under these conditions is the strongest possible evidence for true pharmacological resistance.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**. This patient's profile systematically excludes all common forms of pseudoresistance. The hypertension is confirmed by ABPM, measurement technique is appropriate, and adherence is confirmed by both stable drug levels and, most convincingly, a DOT trial. This is the archetypal presentation of true resistant hypertension.\n\n#### Option C\n*   **Office BP**: $170/100$ mm Hg (Hypertensive).\n*   **Measurement Error**: The cuff ratio is $w/c = 12/33 \\approx 0.36$. This is reasonably close to $0.4$, making significant measurement error unlikely.\n*   **White-Coat Effect**: The ABPM results are all normal: $24$-hour mean $125/77$ mm Hg, daytime mean $132/80$ mm Hg, nighttime mean $112/68$ mm Hg. This indicates a significant **white-coat effect**.\n*   **Adherence**: Plasma amlodipine and chlorthalidone are **undetectable**. Given their long half-lives, their absence at the $24$-hour trough is definitive evidence of **non-adherence**.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This patient's apparently uncontrolled BP is due to a combination of proven non-adherence and a white-coat effect. This is pseudoresistance.\n\n#### Option D\n*   **Office BP**: $162/98$ mm Hg (Hypertensive).\n*   **Measurement Error**: The cuff ratio is $w/c = 14/35 = 0.40$. This is ideal. Measurement error is **ruled out**.\n*   **White-Coat Effect**: The daytime ABPM mean is $137/86$ mm Hg, which is above the threshold of $135/85$ mm Hg. This confirms sustained hypertension and rules out a pure white-coat effect.\n*   **Adherence**: There is strong, multi-faceted evidence for **poor adherence**. Pharmacokinetic testing is inconsistent (\"borderline low\", \"undetectable\"), which is the hallmark of intermittent dosing. Furthermore, the pharmacy refill history shows significant gaps, providing objective, external corroboration of non-adherence.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. While this patient has true, sustained hypertension (not white-coat effect), the most probable cause is poor adherence, which is a form of pseudoresistance. Before diagnosing true resistant hypertension, adherence issues must be resolved.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nPatient B is the only candidate for whom the common confounders—measurement error, white-coat effect, and non-adherence—have been convincingly excluded. The combination of sustained hypertension on ABPM, correct cuff sizing, and persistent hypertension even under directly observed therapy provides the strongest support for a diagnosis of true resistant hypertension.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4849020"}]}
