Do not use any small-$q$ approximation; carry the exact expression through to the final numerical evaluation.", "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem in population genetics that can be solved using first principles.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation and calculation of the carrier frequency for a rare autosomal recessive disease under the assumptions of Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE).\n\nLet us denote the two alleles for the gene in question as $A$ for the dominant (normal) allele and $a$ for the recessive (disease-causing) allele. Let the frequency of the allele $A$ in the population's gene pool be $p$, and the frequency of the allele $a$ be $q$. As these are the only two alleles for this gene locus, their frequencies must sum to unity. This is a fundamental principle of population genetics.\n$$p + q = 1$$\n\nThe Hardy–Weinberg principle states that if a population is large, randomly mating, and not subject to evolutionary forces such as mutation, migration, or selection, the allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation. Under these conditions, the genotype frequencies for the next generation are given by the binomial expansion of the allele frequencies:\n$$(p+q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$$\nHere:\n- $p^2$ is the frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype ($AA$).\n- $2pq$ is the frequency of the heterozygous genotype ($Aa$).\n- $q^2$ is the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype ($aa$).\n\nThe problem states that the disease is autosomal recessive with complete penetrance. This means that only individuals with the homozygous recessive genotype, $aa$, will express the disease phenotype. Therefore, the prevalence of the disease in the population is equal to the frequency of the $aa$ genotype, $q^2$.\n\nWe are given the disease prevalence:\n$$q^2 = \\frac{1}{10,000} = 0.0001$$\n\nFrom this, we can calculate the frequency of the recessive allele, $q$. Since $q$ represents a frequency, it must be a non-negative real number.\n$$q = \\sqrt{q^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{10,000}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10,000}} = \\frac{1}{100}$$\n$$q = 0.01$$\n\nUsing the relationship $p + q = 1$, we can now find the frequency of the dominant allele, $p$.\n$$p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$$\n\nThe problem asks for the carrier frequency. Carriers are individuals who are heterozygous ($Aa$). They do not express the recessive phenotype but can pass the recessive allele ($a$) to their offspring. The frequency of heterozygotes in the population is given by the term $2pq$ in the Hardy-Weinberg equation. This is the derived expression for the carrier frequency in terms of $p$ and $q$.\n\nTo find the numerical value, we substitute the calculated values of $p$ and $q$ into this expression. The problem explicitly forbids the use of any small-$q$ approximation (where $p=1-q \\approx 1$ leading to $2pq \\approx 2q$). We will use the exact calculated value for $p$.\n$$\\text{Carrier Frequency} = 2pq = 2 \\times (0.99) \\times (0.01)$$\n$$2 \\times 0.99 \\times 0.01 = 1.98 \\times 0.01 = 0.0198$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to 4 significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $0.0198$. The leading zeros are not significant. The significant figures are $1$, $9$, and $8$. To express this number with four significant figures, we add a trailing zero. This indicates that the value is known to be precise to that decimal place (i.e., the next digit is $0$).

Assume the following: autosomal recessive inheritance at a single locus, complete penetrance for individuals with two pathogenic alleles, negligible de novo mutation rate, random mating such that carrier probabilities are independent between partners, and equal transmission probability for each allele from a heterozygous parent.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of autosomal recessive inheritance, Mendelian segregation, and basic probability rules, compute the probability that a single child of this couple will have CF. Provide your final answer as an exact fraction. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It provides all necessary information to compute a unique solution based on established principles of medical genetics and probability theory. The assumptions provided are standard for this category of problem. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that a child of a specific couple will have Cystic Fibrosis (CF). CF is an autosomal recessive condition. Let's denote the normal (wild-type) allele as $A$ and the pathogenic CF-causing allele as $a$. For an individual to be affected with CF, their genotype must be homozygous recessive, which is $aa$. The problem specifies complete penetrance, meaning every individual with genotype $aa$ will have the CF phenotype.\n\nThe probability of a child having CF is equivalent to the probability of the child having the genotype $aa$. A child receives one allele from each parent. Therefore, for a child to have genotype $aa$, they must inherit an $a$ allele from Partner $1$ and an $a$ allele from Partner $2$.\n\nLet's analyze the genetic status of each partner.\nPartner $1$: This individual is a confirmed heterozygous carrier. This means their genotype is definitively $Aa$. The probability that Partner $1$ is a carrier is $P(\\text{Partner 1 is } Aa) = 1$.\n\nPartner $2$: This individual's carrier status is not confirmed by a direct test. Instead, we are given a carrier probability based on population data for their ancestry. The probability that Partner $2$ is a heterozygous carrier (genotype $Aa$) is $P(\\text{Partner 2 is } Aa) = \\frac{1}{25}$.\n\nFor the child to have genotype $aa$, a sequence of events must occur:\n$1$. Partner $1$ must be a carrier ($Aa$). This is given as a certainty.\n$2$. Partner $2$ must be a carrier ($Aa$). The probability of this is given as $\\frac{1}{25}$.\n$3$. If both parents are carriers, Partner $1$ must transmit the $a$ allele to the child.\n$4$. If both parents are carriers, Partner $2$ must transmit the $a$ allele to the child.\n\nThe problem states to assume equal transmission probability for each allele from a heterozygous parent. This is a direct application of Mendel's Law of Segregation. For a heterozygous individual ($Aa$), the probability of transmitting the $A$ allele is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of transmitting the $a$ allele is also $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n$P(\\text{Partner 1 transmits } a \\mid \\text{Partner 1 is } Aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n$P(\\text{Partner 2 transmits } a \\mid \\text{Partner 2 is } Aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe probability of a child having genotype $aa$ can be calculated as the joint probability of this chain of events. The problem states that carrier probabilities are independent between partners.\nThe overall probability, $P(\\text{child is } aa)$, is the product of the probabilities of each necessary event:\n\n$P(\\text{child is } aa) = P(\\text{Partner 1 is } Aa) \\times P(\\text{Partner 2 is } Aa) \\times P(\\text{child is } aa \\mid \\text{both are } Aa)$\n\nWe can calculate the third term, which is the conditional probability of an affected child given both parents are carriers ($Aa \\times Aa$). This is the probability that both parents transmit their $a$ allele:\n$P(\\text{child is } aa \\mid \\text{Partner 1 is } Aa \\text{ and Partner 2 is } Aa) = P(\\text{Partner 1 transmits } a) \\times P(\\text{Partner 2 transmits } a)$\n$P(\\text{child is } aa \\mid \\text{both are } Aa) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nNow, we can substitute the known probabilities into the main equation:\n$P(\\text{child is } aa) = P(\\text{Partner 1 is } Aa) \\times P(\\text{Partner 2 is } Aa) \\times \\frac{1}{4}$\n$P(\\text{child is } aa) = 1 \\times \\frac{1}{25} \\times \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nPerforming the multiplication gives the final probability:\n$P(\\text{child is } aa) = \\frac{1 \\times 1}{25 \\times 4} = \\frac{1}{100}$.\n\nThus, the probability that a single child of this couple will have Cystic Fibrosis is $\\frac{1}{100}$.

The concepts of penetrance, obligate carriers, and the use of Bayesian inference to update genetic risk are standard in the field.\n2.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The provided family history is sufficient and consistent for determining the necessary prior probabilities. The woman's affected brother and unaffected father establish that her mother is an obligate carrier. This allows for the calculation of the woman's prior probability of being a carrier. The additional information about her unaffected son provides the basis for a Bayesian update. The conditions of complete penetrance and negligible de novo mutation are crucial and well-defined constraints.\n3.  **Clarity and Unambiguity**: All terms used (e.g., \"X-linked recessive\", \"complete penetrance\") have precise, standard definitions in genetics.

Prior Probabilities: $P(C)$ and $P(\\neg C)$**\nLet $X^A$ denote the normal allele and $X^a$ denote the pathogenic recessive allele.\nThe woman's father is unaffected, so his genotype is $X^A Y$.\nThe woman's brother is affected, so his genotype is $X^a Y$. He must have inherited the $X^a$ allele from his mother, because his father could only contribute a $Y$ chromosome.\nSince the mother has an affected son ($X^a Y$) and must also carry a normal allele (as there is no information to suggest she is affected, and she passed an $X$ to her son), her genotype must be $X^A X^a$. She is an obligate carrier.\nThe woman in question is the daughter of parents with genotypes $X^A X^a$ (mother) and $X^A Y$ (father). She inherits one X chromosome from each parent.\n- From her father, she must inherit $X^A$.\n- From her mother, she has a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability of inheriting $X^A$ and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability of inheriting $X^a$.\nTherefore, her possible genotypes are $X^A X^A$ (with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$) or $X^A X^a$ (with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$).\nThe prior probability that she is a carrier ($C$) is the probability of having the genotype $X^A X^a$.\n$$ P(C) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe prior probability that she is not a carrier ($\\neg C$), genotype $X^A X^A$, is:\n$$ P(\\neg C) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\n**2. Conditional Probabilities (Likelihoods): $P(U_1|C)$ and $P(U_1|\\neg C)$**\nThis is the probability of having an unaffected son, given the woman's carrier status.\n- If the woman is a carrier ($C$), her genotype is $X^A X^a$. She will pass on either $X^A$ or $X^a$ to a son with equal probability. A son inheriting $X^a$ will be affected (due to complete penetrance), and a son inheriting $X^A$ will be unaffected. Thus, the probability of her having an unaffected son is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n$$ P(U_1|C) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n- If the woman is not a carrier ($\\neg C$), her genotype is $X^A X^A$.
