The problem states that the World Health Organization's definition uses a log-linear calibration between reagent responsiveness and the normalized value.\n\nLet $PT_{\\text{patient}}$ be the patient's prothrombin time and $PT_{\\text{MN}}$ be the laboratory's mean normal prothrombin time. The reagent responsiveness is captured by the prothrombin time ratio, $R$, defined as:\n$$ R = \\frac{PT_{\\text{patient}}}{PT_{\\text{MN}}} $$\nThe normalized value is the INR. The specified log-linear relationship means that the logarithm of the INR is a linear function of the logarithm of the ratio $R$. Using the natural logarithm, we can write this relationship as:\n$$ \\ln(INR) = m \\cdot \\ln(R) + c $$\nwhere $m$ is the slope and $c$ is the intercept.\n\nTo determine the intercept $c$, we consider the case of a healthy individual whose prothrombin time is equal to the mean normal time. For such a case, $PT_{\\text{patient}} = PT_{\\text{MN}}$, which means the ratio $R=1$. By definition, the INR for a normal sample must be $1$. Substituting these values, $R=1$ and $INR=1$, into the log-linear equation:\n$$ \\ln(1) = m \\cdot \\ln(1) + c $$\n$$ 0 = m \\cdot 0 + c $$\nThis implies that the intercept $c=0$. The calibration line must pass through the origin of the log-log plot. The equation thus simplifies to:\n$$ \\ln(INR) = m \\cdot \\ln(R) $$\nThe slope $m$ in this relationship is the factor that calibrates the local reagent's responsiveness to the international reference standard. This calibration factor is precisely the International Sensitivity Index (ISI). Therefore, we set $m = ISI$.\n$$ \\ln(INR) = (ISI) \\cdot \\ln(R) $$\nTo solve for INR, we use the logarithmic identity $a \\ln(b) = \\ln(b^a)$:\n$$ \\ln(INR) = \\ln(R^{ISI}) $$\nExponentiating both sides of the equation yields the desired analytic expression for INR:\n$$ INR = R^{ISI} $$\nSubstituting the definition of $R$, we get the full expression:\n$$ INR = \\left( \\frac{PT_{\\text{patient}}}{PT_{\\text{MN}}} \\right)^{ISI} $$\nNow, we compute the INR for the given values:\n$PT_{\\text{patient}} = 24\\ \\text{s}$\n$PT_{\\text{MN}} = 12\\ \\text{s}$\n$ISI = 1.2$\n\nFirst, calculate the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{24}{12} = 2 $$\nNext, calculate the INR:\n$$ INR = 2^{1.2} $$\nTo evaluate this numerically:\n$$ INR = \\exp(1.2 \\cdot \\ln(2)) \\approx \\exp(1.2 \\cdot 0.693147) \\approx \\exp(0.831776) \\approx 2.2973967 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the INR is $2.297$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for an explanation of how rounding influences the reported INR and to quantify the possible change. The coagulometer rounds PT measurements to the nearest $0.1\\ \\text{s}$. This means a displayed value of $X$ implies the true value lies in the interval $[X - 0.05, X + 0.05)$. For the given displayed values of $PT_{\\text{patient}} = 24.0\\ \\text{s}$ and $PT_{\\text{MN}} = 12.0\\ \\text{s}$, the true values fall within the following ranges:\n$$ PT_{\\text{patient, true}} \\in [23.95, 24.05) $$\n$$ PT_{\\text{MN, true}} \\in [11.95, 12.05) $$\nThe rounding of these two independent measurements introduces uncertainty into the calculated INR. This uncertainty is propagated through the nonlinear function $INR = (PT_{\\text{patient}}/PT_{\\text{MN}})^{ISI}$.\n\nTo quantify the worst-case change, we must find the maximum and minimum possible INR values. The function $f(x, y) = (x/y)^a$ with $a > 0$ is an increasing function of $x$ and a decreasing function of $y$.\nThe maximum INR ($INR_{\\text{max}}$) occurs with the maximum possible $PT_{\\text{patient}}$ and the minimum possible $PT_{\\text{MN}}$:\n$$ INR_{\\text{max}} = \\left(\\frac{24.05}{11.95}\\right)^{1.2} \\approx (2.01255)^{1.2} \\approx 2.32136 $$\nThe minimum INR ($INR_{\\text{min}}$) occurs with the minimum possible $PT_{\\text{patient}}$ and the maximum possible $PT_{\\text{MN}}$:\n$$ INR_{\\text{min}} = \\left(\\frac{23.95}{12.05}\\right)^{1.2} \\approx (1.98755)^{1.2} \\approx 2.27361 $$\nThe range of possible INR values due to rounding is therefore approximately $[2.27361, 2.32136]$. The computed central value is $INR_0 \\approx 2.29740$. The change relative to this central value can be quantified:\n$$ \\Delta_{max} = INR_{\\text{max}} - INR_0 \\approx 2.32136 - 2.29740 = 0.02396 $$\n$$ \\Delta_{min} = INR_0 - INR_{\\text{min}} \\approx 2.29740 - 2.27361 = 0.02379 $$\nThus, the rounding of PT values to the nearest $0.1\\ \\text{s}$ can lead to a variation in the reported INR of approximately $\\pm 0.024$ around the value calculated from the displayed numbers. This demonstrates that even small measurement imprecisions can be amplified by the nonlinear nature of the INR calculation, which is particularly relevant for clinical decision-making at critical INR thresholds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.297}$$", "id": "4816770"}, {"introduction": "An isolated prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) presents a common diagnostic dilemma: is it caused by a factor deficiency or a circulating inhibitor?

The given values are:\n$T_p = 75\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$T_n = 30\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$T_m = 38\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nThe \"abnormal prolongation\" is the extent to which the patient's aPTT exceeds the normal aPTT.

This measures how much the mixing \"corrected\" the value.\n$$ \\text{Reduction in Prolongation} = T_p - T_m $$\n\nThe problem defines the \"correction fraction\", let's call it $C$, as \"the fraction by which the abnormal prolongation is reduced\". This translates to the ratio of the \"Reduction in Prolongation\" to the initial \"Abnormal Prolongation\".\n$$ C = \\frac{\\text{Reduction in Prolongation}}{\\text{Abnormal Prolongation}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for these terms, we get the formal equation for the correction fraction:\n$$ C = \\frac{T_p - T_m}{T_p - T_n} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this equation:\n$$ C = \\frac{75 - 38}{75 - 30} $$\n$$ C = \\frac{37}{45} $$\n\nTo obtain the decimal value, we perform the division:\n$$ C = 0.82222... $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to four significant figures.\n$$ C \\approx 0.8222 $$\n\nThe next step is to interpret this result. The specified threshold for correction is $50\\%$, which corresponds to a correction fraction of $0.50$.

This is characteristic of a **coagulation factor deficiency** in the intrinsic or common pathway (e.g., deficiency of factors VIII, IX, XI, XII, or von Willebrand factor). The addition of normal plasma replenishes the deficient factor(s) to a level sufficient to normalize the clotting time (typically, a factor level of about $30\\%-50\\%$ is adequate, which is achieved in a $1:1$ mix if the patient's level is near $0\\%$).\n- **Correction absent**: If the aPTT of the mixture remained prolonged (i.e., did not correct, $C < 0.50$), it would imply the presence of a **circulating inhibitor** in the patient's plasma. An inhibitor (e.g., a lupus anticoagulant or an antibody against a specific clotting factor) would inactivate not only the patient's clotting factors but also the factors supplied by the normal pooled plasma, thus preventing correction.\n\nTherefore, for this patient, the presence of immediate correction strongly suggests a coagulation factor deficiency is the cause of the prolonged aPTT.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.8222} $$", "id": "4816725"}, {"introduction": "A crucial concept in clinical practice is the disconnect between a rising INR and the achievement of a true antithrombotic state when initiating warfarin.

This problem can be solved by modeling the plasma activity of the relevant coagulation factors using first-order linear kinetics.\n\nFirst, we establish the general kinetic model. The rate of change of the plasma activity $C_i(t)$ of a given coagulation factor $i$ is described by the balance between its synthesis rate, $S_i$, and its elimination rate. Assuming first-order elimination, this is given by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_i(t)}{dt} = S_i - k_i C_i(t)\n$$\nwhere $k_i$ is the first-order elimination rate constant for factor $i$.\n\nThe problem states that before warfarin initiation (for time $t < 0$), the system is at a steady state. Let the pre-warfarin synthesis rate be $S_{i,0}$ and the corresponding steady-state activity be $C_{i,0}$. At steady state, $\\frac{dC_i(t)}{dt} = 0$, so we have:\n$$\n0 = S_{i,0} - k_i C_{i,0} \\implies S_{i,0} = k_i C_{i,0}\n$$\nThis provides a relationship between the initial synthesis rate and the initial steady-state activity. The baseline INR of $1$ corresponds to normal factor activities, which we can normalize to $C_{i,0} = 1$ for all factors without loss of generality.\n\nAt time $t=0$, warfarin is started. It reduces the synthesis rate of vitamin K-dependent factors to a fraction $\\alpha$ of the pre-warfarin rate. The new synthesis rate for $t \\ge 0$ is $S_{i, \\text{new}} = \\alpha S_{i,0}$. The elimination rate constant $k_i$ remains unchanged. The differential equation for $t \\ge 0$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_i(t)}{dt} = \\alpha S_{i,0} - k_i C_i(t)\n$$\nSubstituting $S_{i,0} = k_i C_{i,0}$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_i(t)}{dt} = \\alpha k_i C_{i,0} - k_i C_i(t) = -k_i [C_i(t) - \\alpha C_{i,0}]\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separation of variables with the initial condition $C_i(0) = C_{i,0}$ (the activity at the moment of warfarin initiation is the pre-existing steady-state activity).\n\nThe general solution to this ODE is of the form $C_i(t) = A + B\\exp(-k_i t)$.
