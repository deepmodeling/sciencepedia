It presents a standard scenario in cellular electrophysiology, providing all necessary parameters to calculate the Nernst potential for chloride and evaluate its effect on the membrane potential. The provided concentrations and resting potential are physiologically plausible for a neuron in a pathological state, specifically one associated with neuropathic pain where chloride homeostasis is known to be dysregulated. All terms are clearly defined, and the required calculations are straightforward applications of fundamental principles. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nFirst, we derive the Nernst relation for an anion starting from the principle of thermodynamic equilibrium. The electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_j$, for an ionic species $j$ is given by:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_j = \\mu_j^0 + RT \\ln(a_j) + z_j F V\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_j^0$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $a_j$ is the activity of the ion, $z_j$ is its valence, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $V$ is the electrical potential.\n\nAt equilibrium, there is no net flux of the ion across the membrane, which implies that the electrochemical potential of the ion is equal on both sides of the membrane (intracellular and extracellular):\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_{j, \\text{in}} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{j, \\text{out}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the electrochemical potential, we have:\n$$\n\\mu_j^0 + RT \\ln(a_{j, \\text{in}}) + z_j F V_{\\text{in}} = \\mu_j^0 + RT \\ln(a_{j, \\text{out}}) + z_j F V_{\\text{out}}\n$$\nThe standard chemical potential $\\mu_j^0$ is the same on both sides and cancels out. Rearranging the terms to solve for the potential difference across the membrane, $V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{out}}$, which is defined as the equilibrium potential or Nernst potential, $E_j$:\n$$\nz_j F (V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{out}}) = RT \\ln(a_{j, \\text{out}}) - RT \\ln(a_{j, \\text{in}})\n$$\n$$\nz_j F E_j = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{j, \\text{out}}}{a_{j, \\text{in}}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_j = \\frac{RT}{z_j F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{j, \\text{out}}}{a_{j, \\text{in}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that activities can be approximated by concentrations, so $a_j \\approx [j]$. For the chloride ion, $\\text{Cl}^-$, the valence is $z_\\text{Cl} = -1$. The Nernst potential for chloride, $E_\\text{Cl}$, is therefore:\n$$\nE_\\text{Cl} = \\frac{RT}{(-1)F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{Cl}^-]_{\\text{out}}}{[\\text{Cl}^-]_{\\text{in}}}\\right) = -\\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{Cl}^-]_{\\text{out}}}{[\\text{Cl}^-]_{\\text{in}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis relation can also be written in an equivalent form by inverting the argument of the logarithm:\n$$\nE_\\text{Cl} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{Cl}^-]_{\\text{in}}}{[\\text{Cl}^-]_{\\text{out}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the appropriate Nernst relation for an anion like chloride.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $E_\\text{Cl}$ using the given data:\n- Temperature, $T = 310 \\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- Intracellular chloride concentration, $[\\text{Cl}^-]_{\\text{in}} = 20 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$\n- Extracellular chloride concentration, $[\\text{Cl}^-]_{\\text{out}} = 110 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$\n- Universal gas constant, $R \\approx 8.314 \\ \\mathrm{J \\cdot mol^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}}$\n- Faraday constant, $F \\approx 96485 \\ \\mathrm{C \\cdot mol^{-1}}$\n- Chloride valence, $z_\\text{Cl} = -1$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived Nernst equation:\n$$\nE_\\text{Cl} = \\frac{(8.314 \\ \\mathrm{J \\cdot mol^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}})(310 \\ \\mathrm{K})}{(-1)(96485 \\ \\mathrm{C \\cdot mol^{-1}})} \\ln\\left(\\frac{110 \\ \\mathrm{mM}}{20 \\ \\mathrm{mM}}\\right)\n$$\nThe units $\\mathrm{J/C}$ yield Volts.

The definition of $s$ is based on the relationship between these two potentials.\n- We have $E_\\text{Cl} = -45.54 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and $V_{\\text{rest}} = -65 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$.\n- We compare these values: $-45.54 > -65$.\n- This corresponds to the case $E_\\text{Cl} > V_{\\text{rest}}$.\n- According to the problem definition, if $E_\\text{Cl} > V_{\\text{rest}}$, then $s = +1$.\n\nThis result indicates that the reversal potential for chloride is less negative than the resting membrane potential. Consequently, if GABA$_A$ receptor channels were to open, the net movement of $\\text{Cl}^-$ ions would be an efflux (out of the cell) because the membrane potential is more negative than the chloride equilibrium potential. An efflux of negative ions is a depolarizing current, which drives the membrane potential towards a less negative value (from $-65 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$ towards $-45.54 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$). This depolarization is considered excitatory in its effect.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $(E_\\text{Cl}, s)$.

The experimental design allows for the isolation of this component. The vehicle condition measures the total LTP, which includes both NMDA receptor-dependent and NMDA receptor-independent potentiation. The APV condition pharmacologically blocks NMDA receptors, so any potentiation observed is attributed to NMDA receptor-independent mechanisms. The difference between the two conditions thus isolates the NMDA receptor-dependent component.\n\nThe problem defines \"normalized change\" as the relative change in signal amplitude with respect to its baseline. For a baseline amplitude $A_{base}$ and a post-induction amplitude $A_{post}$, the normalized change, denoted by $\\Delta$, is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{A_{post} - A_{base}}{A_{base}}\n$$\nThis is a dimensionless quantity representing the fractional increase in amplitude.\n\nFirst, we calculate the normalized change for the vehicle condition, $\\Delta_{veh}$.

This pattern is pathognomonic for a **small-fiber neuropathy**.\n\n        3.  **Analysis of Dynamic Mechanical Allodynia:**\n            *   This is the most complex finding to explain. Allodynia is the perception of pain from a stimulus that is not normally painful. In this case, `light brushing` (a low-threshold mechanical stimulus) evokes severe pain ($7/10$).\n            *   Light brushing activates low-threshold mechanoreceptors, whose signals are transmitted by the intact $A\\beta$ fibers.\n            *   The puzzle is: how can a normal touch signal, traveling along a normal $A\\beta$ fiber, be interpreted as pain by the central nervous system?\n            *   This phenomenon cannot be adequately explained by peripheral mechanisms alone, especially given the evidence of small-fiber *loss* (hypoesthesia), not sensitization. Peripheral sensitization would lower pain thresholds (hyperalgesia), but here the thermal pain threshold is *elevated* (hypoalgesia).\n            *   The established mechanism for this type of allodynia is **central sensitization** in the spinal cord dorsal horn. The chronic loss of input from $A\\delta$ and $C$ fibers (deafferentation) triggers neuroplastic changes:\n                *   **Disinhibition:** A reduction in the normal inhibitory tone (e.g., GABAergic or glycinergic) that typically segregates tactile and nociceptive pathways.\n                *   **Sprouting and Synaptic Reorganization:** Low-threshold $A\\beta$ afferents may sprout from their normal termination sites (laminae III-V) into more superficial laminae (I-II), where nociceptive projection neurons are located.\n            *   As a result of these central changes, the non-nociceptive signal from $A\\beta$ fibers gains access to and powerfully activates the now hyperexcitable and disinhibited second-order nociceptive neurons. This signal then ascends via the spinothalamic tract and is interpreted by the brain as pain.\n\n        4.  **Integrated Synthesis:**\n            The most parsimonious explanation for the entire clinical picture is a primary small-fiber neuropathy causing deafferentation of the spinal dorsal horn. This deafferentation leads to secondary central sensitization, which in turn causes intact $A\\beta$ fiber input to be misperceived as pain, producing dynamic mechanical allodynia.\n\n    *   **Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n        *   **A. Predominant small-fiber ($A\\delta$ and $C$) deafferentation with intact low-threshold mechanoreceptor $A\\beta$ input, leading to dorsal horn central sensitization and disinhibition; as a result, $A\\beta$ input engages nociceptive projection neurons via polysynaptic excitatory circuits, producing dynamic mechanical allodynia despite preserved vibration sense.**\n            *   This statement accurately reflects the step-by-step derivation above. It correctly identifies the small-fiber deafferentation, the preserved $A\\beta$ function, the resulting central sensitization, and the mechanism by which $A\\beta$ input triggers allodynia.

It fails to account for the clear signs of small-fiber *loss of function* (elevated warm, cold, and heat pain thresholds). Peripheral sensitization would lead to hyperalgesia (lowered thresholds), the opposite of what is observed for thermal stimuli. Therefore, this model is inconsistent with the QST data.\n            *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n        *   **D. Cervical dorsal column lesion selectively interrupting $A\\beta$ projections to the dorsal column nuclei, forcing tactile signals to be rerouted through the spinothalamic tract, thereby generating mechanical allodynia but sparing vibration detection.**\n            *   This option proposes an incorrect location and a flawed mechanism.

Thalamic ventral posterolateral nucleus lesion causing central pain with touch–pain misperception that manifests as dynamic mechanical allodynia while preserving dorsal column-mediated vibration sense due to thalamic sensory reweighting.**\n            *   This option posits a primary brain lesion. While a thalamic lesion can cause central pain and allodynia, it does not explain the peripheral signs of small-fiber neuropathy (elevated thermal thresholds), which point to a problem with the primary sensory neurons. Additionally, a unilateral thalamic lesion would typically cause contralateral symptoms, not the symmetric, length-dependent pattern described. The pathology originates in the periphery, not the thalamus.\n            *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4868143"}]}
