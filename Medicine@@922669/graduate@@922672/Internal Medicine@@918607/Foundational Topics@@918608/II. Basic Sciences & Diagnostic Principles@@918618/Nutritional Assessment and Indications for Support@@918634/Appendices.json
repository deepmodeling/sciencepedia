Report the BMI to four significant figures and express it in $\\mathrm{kg/m^2}$. The final numeric answer should be only the computed BMI.", "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides all necessary, realistic data to perform the requested calculations and clinical assessment based on established medical principles and screening tools. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe first task is to compute the Body Mass Index (BMI) of the patient. The BMI is defined as the mass in kilograms, $W$, divided by the square of the height in meters, $H$.\n$$\n\\text{BMI} = \\frac{W}{H^2}\n$$\nGiven the patient's current mass $W = 62\\ \\mathrm{kg}$ and height $H = 1.64\\ \\mathrm{m}$, the BMI is calculated as follows:\n$$\n\\text{BMI} = \\frac{62}{(1.64)^2} = \\frac{62}{2.6896} \\approx 23.05175...\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}\n$$\nThe problem requires the BMI to be reported to four significant figures. Therefore, the patient's BMI is $23.05\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$.\n\nThe second task is to determine if this clinical picture indicates a significant nutritional risk. This assessment requires a more nuanced analysis than relying on the BMI value alone.\n\nThe patient's BMI of $23.05\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$ falls within the range of $18.5\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$ to $24.9\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$, which is classified as 'normal weight' by the World Health Organization. However, a static BMI measurement can be misleading, particularly in an individual who is acutely or chronically ill. The trajectory of weight change is a more sensitive indicator of a decline in nutritional status.\n\nThe problem states an unintentional weight loss fraction of $0.08$, which corresponds to an $8\\%$ loss of body weight over a period of $3$ months. This is a critical datum. We can analyze this using established clinical screening frameworks such as those from the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) and the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST).\n\nAccording to the $2015$ ESPEN consensus definition, malnutrition can be diagnosed based on weight loss criteria. Specifically, a weight loss of greater than $5\\%$ over $3$ months is considered significant and is one of the primary criteria for diagnosing malnutrition. In this case, the patient's weight loss of $8\\%$ in $3$ months exceeds this threshold. For a hospitalized patient, such a rate of weight loss is a strong indicator of a hypermetabolic or hypercatabolic state and/or inadequate nutritional intake relative to needs, thus placing the patient at high nutritional risk.\n\nUsing the MUST framework, we can assign scores to different risk factors:\n1.  **BMI Score:** For a BMI of $23.05\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$ (which is greater than $20.0\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$), the score is $0$.\n2.  **Weight Loss Score:** For an unplanned weight loss of $8\\%$ in the last $3$ months (which falls into the $5-10\\%$ category), the score is $1$.\n3.  **Acute Disease Effect Score:** The patient is on an internal medicine ward, which implies the presence of an acute illness. If this illness has led to, or is likely to lead to, no nutritional intake for more than $5$ days, an additional score of $2$ is added.\n\nThe sum of the scores gives the overall risk level. Based on BMI and weight loss alone, the MUST score is $0 + 1 = 1$, which indicates 'medium risk'. This score mandates observation and documentation of dietary intake. However, given the context of a hospitalized patient, it is highly probable that the acute disease state is a significant contributing factor. If the 'acute disease effect' score is applied, the total score becomes $1 + 2 = 3$, indicating 'high risk'. A high-risk score necessitates immediate action, including referral to a specialist dietitian and implementation of a nutrition support plan.\n\nFinally, the statement that the patient shows no clinical evidence of edema or ascites is of high importance. It confirms that the measured mass is not artificially inflated by fluid retention, and thus the $62\\ \\mathrm{kg}$ likely represents the patient's true dry mass. Consequently, the observed weight loss is a true reflection of lost body tissue (i.e., fat and muscle mass), which reinforces the severity of the nutritional deficit.\n\nIn conclusion, despite a BMI in the 'normal' range, the patient's history of significant unintentional weight loss ($8\\%$ in $3$ months) in the context of being a hospital inpatient is a definitive indicator of a clinically significant nutritional risk. This condition warrants a thorough nutritional assessment and serious consideration for initiating nutrition support to prevent further decline and improve clinical outcomes.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{23.05}\n$$", "id": "4876113"}, {"introduction": "Once nutritional risk is identified, quantifying the patient's metabolic state and protein requirements is a key step, particularly in the critically ill. The concept of nitrogen balance provides a powerful tool to assess whether protein intake is sufficient to meet the demands of metabolic stress and prevent the net loss of lean body mass. This practice provides direct experience in calculating nitrogen balance, a fundamental skill for managing nutrition support in catabolic patients.

The data provided are realistic for a patient in a critical care setting.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the patient's daily nitrogen balance, which is defined as the difference between nitrogen intake and nitrogen losses. Let us denote the daily nitrogen balance as $N_{balance}$. The governing equation, as stated, is:\n$$N_{balance} = N_{intake} - N_{losses}$$\nwhere $N_{intake}$ is the total daily nitrogen intake and $N_{losses}$ is the total daily nitrogen excretion. Each term must be calculated from the data provided.\n\nFirst, we calculate the nitrogen intake, $N_{intake}$. The patient is receiving $110\\ \\mathrm{g}$ of protein per day. The problem states that protein contains approximately $16\\%$ nitrogen by mass. Therefore, the mass of nitrogen intake is:\n$$N_{intake} = (\\text{Protein Intake}) \\times (\\text{Fraction of Nitrogen in Protein})$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$N_{intake} = 110\\ \\mathrm{g/day} \\times 0.16$$\n$$N_{intake} = 17.6\\ \\mathrm{g/day}$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the total nitrogen losses, $N_{losses}$. These losses are the sum of urinary nitrogen losses and non-urinary nitrogen losses. The problem provides the 24-hour urinary urea nitrogen (UUN) as a measure of urinary loss and provides a standard estimate for non-urinary losses.\n$$N_{losses} = (\\text{Urinary Nitrogen Loss}) + (\\text{Non-urinary Nitrogen Loss})$$\nIn this clinical context, the urinary urea nitrogen is used to represent the urinary nitrogen loss.\nLet $N_{urinary} = \\text{UUN} = 12\\ \\mathrm{g/day}$.\nLet $N_{non-urinary} = 4\\ \\mathrm{g/day}$, which accounts for fecal, dermal, and other miscellaneous losses.\nSumming these components gives the total daily nitrogen loss:\n$$N_{losses} = 12\\ \\mathrm{g/day} + 4\\ \\mathrm{g/day}$$\n$$N_{losses} = 16\\ \\mathrm{g/day}$$\n\nFinally, we can compute the patient's nitrogen balance, $N_{balance}$, by substituting the calculated values for $N_{intake}$ and $N_{losses}$ into the balance equation:\n$$N_{balance} = 17.6\\ \\mathrm{g/day} - 16\\ \\mathrm{g/day}$$\n$$N_{balance} = 1.6\\ \\mathrm{g/day}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) is a real, evidence-based, and globally recognized framework. Crohn disease is a known cause of malnutrition due to inflammation, malabsorption, and reduced intake. The biomarkers (CRP) and anthropometric measures (BMI, weight loss) are standard in clinical practice. The data are internally consistent; a calculation of the BMI from the given weight and height confirms the provided value: $\\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight}}{\\text{height}^2} = \\frac{55.7\\;\\text{kg}}{(1.75\\;\\text{m})^2} = \\frac{55.7}{3.0625}\\;\\text{kg/m}^2 \\approx 18.19\\;\\text{kg/m}^2$, which matches the reported value of $18.2\\ \\text{kg/m}^2$. The described pathophysiology is sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a specific diagnostic framework (GLIM) and all necessary patient data points to apply it. The question asks for a specific classification based on these rules and data. There are no missing essential data or contradictory constraints.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and well-posed. It is a valid problem for which a definitive answer can be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) framework employs a two-step process for diagnosis: first, establishing the presence of malnutrition by confirming at least one phenotypic and one etiologic criterion, and second, grading the severity based on the magnitude of the phenotypic criteria.\n\n**1. Assessment for Presence of Malnutrition**\n\n**a. Phenotypic Criteria (at least one required)**\nWe must evaluate the patient's status against the three main phenotypic criteria:\n\ni.  **Non-volitional Weight Loss:**\n    The patient's weight decreased from an initial weight, $W_i = 63.3\\ \\text{kg}$, to a final weight, $W_f = 55.7\\ \\text{kg}$, over a period of 6 months. The percentage of weight loss is calculated as:\n    $$ \\text{Weight Loss} \\% = \\frac{W_i - W_f}{W_i} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{63.3\\ \\text{kg} - 55.7\\ \\text{kg}}{63.3\\ \\text{kg}} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{7.6}{63.3} \\times 100\\% \\approx 12.006\\% $$\n    This weight loss of ~12.0% in 6 months exceeds the typical GLIM threshold for malnutrition (which is >5% in 6 months). Thus, this phenotypic criterion is **met**.\n\nii. **Low Body Mass Index (BMI):**\n    The patient's current BMI is stated as $18.2\\ \\text{kg/m}^2$. The patient's age is 58 years. For individuals younger than 70 years, a BMI less than $20.0\\ \\text{kg/m}^2$ is a phenotypic criterion for malnutrition. Since $18.2  20.0$, this phenotypic criterion is **met**.\n\niii. **Reduced Muscle Mass:**\n     The problem explicitly states that the abdominal CT scan demonstrates a \"quantitatively reduced skeletal muscle index (SMI) ... below validated sex-specific cutoffs for low muscle mass.\" This directly confirms that the criterion for reduced muscle mass is **met**.\n\nSince the patient fulfills all three phenotypic criteria, the first part of the diagnostic requirement is satisfied.\n\n**b. Etiologic Criteria (at least one required)**\nWe must evaluate the patient against the two main etiologic domains:\n\ni.  **Reduced Food Intake or Assimilation:**\n    The patient \"reports reduced oral intake due to abdominal pain and diarrhea.\" Furthermore, Crohn disease is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by malabsorption, which impairs nutrient assimilation. This etiologic criterion is therefore **met**.\n\nii. **Disease Burden / Inflammation:**\n    The patient has \"long-standing Crohn disease,\" which constitutes a significant chronic disease burden. Additionally, the C-reactive protein (CRP) level is \"persistently elevated at 20 mg/L,\" which is a clear objective indicator of systemic inflammation (a normal CRP is typically 5 mg/L). This etiologic criterion is **met**.\n\n**Conclusion on Diagnosis:** The patient meets at least one phenotypic criterion (in fact, three) and at least one etiologic criterion (in fact, both). Therefore, a diagnosis of malnutrition according to the GLIM framework is confirmed.\n\n**2. Grading of Malnutrition Severity**\n\nThe severity of malnutrition (Stage 1 for moderate, Stage 2 for severe) is determined by the severity of the phenotypic criteria. The problem provides the specific cutoffs for severe deficits.\n\ni.  **Severity based on Weight Loss:**\n    The problem states that a non-volitional weight loss of more than 10% within 6 months represents a **severe** phenotypic deficit. The patient's calculated weight loss is ~12.0% in 6 months. Since 12.0%  10%, this criterion indicates **severe malnutrition**.\n\nii. **Severity based on BMI:**\n    The problem states that for an adult younger than 70 years, a BMI below $18.5\\ \\text{kg/m}^2$ is considered a **severe** phenotypic deficit. The patient is 58 years old and has a BMI of $18.2\\ \\text{kg/m}^2$. Since $18.2  18.5$, this criterion also indicates **severe malnutrition**.\n\n**Conclusion on Severity:** The patient meets at least one criterion for severe malnutrition (in this case, two distinct criteria: weight loss percentage and BMI). According to the GLIM framework, the presence of any single severe-grade phenotypic criterion is sufficient to classify the malnutrition as severe. Therefore, the most accurate classification is severe malnutrition (Stage 2).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Meets GLIM criteria for severe malnutrition (stage 2)**: This aligns perfectly with the derivation. The patient satisfies the diagnostic criteria for malnutrition, and the magnitude of both weight loss (10%) and low BMI ($18.5\\ \\text{kg/m}^2$) meet the specified thresholds for severe (Stage 2) malnutrition. **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. Meets GLIM criteria for moderate malnutrition (stage 1)**: This is incorrect. While the patient does have malnutrition, the phenotypic indicators (weight loss of ~12.0% and BMI of $18.2\\ \\text{kg/m}^2$) surpass the thresholds for moderate malnutrition and fall squarely within the severe category. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. Phenotypic criteria are met but etiologic criteria are not met; therefore GLIM malnutrition is not present**: This is factually wrong based on the provided data. The patient has both a severe disease burden (Crohn disease) with objective evidence of inflammation (CRP of 20 mg/L) and reduced intake/assimilation. The etiologic criteria are clearly met. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Data are insufficient to apply GLIM; therefore no GLIM classification can be made**: This is incorrect. The problem provides a comprehensive dataset including anthropometrics (weight, height, change over time), an advanced measure of body composition (SMI), an inflammatory marker (CRP), and clinical history (diagnosis, intake, symptoms), which is more than sufficient to apply the GLIM framework as described. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4876132"}]}
