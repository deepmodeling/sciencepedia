Let $C(t)$ denote the plasma concentration of CRP (mass per unit volume), $k_{in}(t)$ the net hepatic input rate into the plasma compartment (mass per unit volume per unit time), and $k_{out}$ the first-order elimination rate constant (per unit time). The mass balance is $\\frac{dC}{dt} = k_{in}(t) - k_{out} C$.

The location of the maximum can be determined by analyzing the sign of the derivative, $\\frac{dC}{dt}$.\n\n**Analysis of the behavior of $C(t)$:**\nThe input rate $k_{in}(t)$ is a piecewise function. We analyze the derivative $\\frac{dC}{dt}$ in the two main time intervals after the stimulus begins at $t=0$.\n\n1.  **Interval $0 \\le t < T_{on}$:**\n    In this interval, $k_{in}(t) = k_{in,1}$. The differential equation is $\\frac{dC}{dt} = k_{in,1} - k_{out} C(t)$.\n    The initial concentration is $C(0) = \\frac{k_{in,0}}{k_{out}}$.\n    Let's evaluate the derivative at $t=0$:\n    $$ \\frac{dC}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} = k_{in,1} - k_{out} C(0) = k_{in,1} - k_{out} \\left(\\frac{k_{in,0}}{k_{out}}\\right) = k_{in,1} - k_{in,0} $$\n    Since the problem states $k_{in,1} > k_{in,0}$, the initial slope is positive, $\\frac{dC}{dt}|_{t=0} > 0$. The concentration $C(t)$ will begin to increase.\n    The concentration will rise towards a new, higher steady-state value of $C_{ss,1} = \\frac{k_{in,1}}{k_{out}}$. As long as $C(t)  C_{ss,1}$, the derivative $\\frac{dC}{dt} = k_{in,1} - k_{out} C(t)$ will remain positive. Since $C(t)$ starts at $C(0) = \\frac{k_{in,0}}{k_{out}}  \\frac{k_{in,1}}{k_{out}} = C_{ss,1}$ and approaches $C_{ss,1}$ from below, $C(t)$ is strictly and monotonically increasing throughout the interval $[0, T_{on})$.\n\n2.  **Interval $t \\ge T_{on}$:**\n    In this interval, the input rate switches back to baseline, $k_{in}(t) = k_{in,0}$. The differential equation becomes $\\frac{dC}{dt} = k_{in,0} - k_{out} C(t)$.\n    The concentration at the beginning of this interval is $C(T_{on})$. Since $C(t)$ was increasing for $t \\in [0, T_{on})$, we know that $C(T_{on}) > C(0) = \\frac{k_{in,0}}{k_{out}}$.\n    Let's evaluate the derivative just after $t=T_{on}$, denoted by $t=T_{on}^{+}$:\n    $$ \\frac{dC}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=T_{on}^{+}} = k_{in,0} - k_{out} C(T_{on}) $$\n    Since $C(T_{on}) > \\frac{k_{in,0}}{k_{out}}$, it follows that $k_{out} C(T_{on}) > k_{in,0}$. Therefore, the slope is negative: $\\frac{dC}{dt}|_{t=T_{on}^{+}}  0$.\n    The concentration will decrease, relaxing back towards the original steady-state value $C_{ss,0} = \\frac{k_{in,0}}{k_{out}}$. Thus, $C(t)$ is monotonically decreasing for all $t > T_{on}$.\n\n**Conclusion on Peak Time and Concentration:**\nThe function $C(t)$ is continuous. It increases monotonically until $t=T_{on}$ and decreases monotonically thereafter. Therefore, the maximum concentration, $C_{peak}$, must be reached at the exact moment the stimulus ends.\n$$ t_{peak} = T_{on} $$\nThe value of the peak concentration is the concentration at this time:\n$$ C_{peak} = C(T_{on}) $$\n\n**Solving the ODE for $C(t)$ in the interval $0 \\le t  T_{on}$:**\nTo find the expression for $C(T_{on})$, we must solve the ODE for this interval:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} + k_{out} C(t) = k_{in,1} $$\nThis is a first-order linear inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. A simpler method is to use an integrating factor, $I(t) = \\exp(\\int k_{out} dt) = \\exp(k_{out} t)$.\nMultiplying the ODE by $I(t)$ gives:\n$$ \\exp(k_{out} t)\\frac{dC}{dt} + k_{out}\\exp(k_{out} t)C(t) = k_{in,1}\\exp(k_{out} t) $$\nThe left side is the derivative of a product:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left( C(t)\\exp(k_{out} t) \\right) = k_{in,1}\\exp(k_{out} t) $$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$ C(t)\\exp(k_{out} t) = \\int k_{in,1}\\exp(k_{out} t) dt = \\frac{k_{in,1}}{k_{out}}\\exp(k_{out} t) + A $$\nwhere $A$ is the constant of integration. Solving for $C(t)$:\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{k_{in,1}}{k_{out}} + A \\exp(-k_{out} t) $$\nTo find $A$, we apply the initial condition $C(0) = \\frac{k_{in,0}}{k_{out}}$:\n$$ C(0) = \\frac{k_{in,0}}{k_{out}} = \\frac{k_{in,1}}{k_{out}} + A \\exp(-k_{out} \\cdot 0) = \\frac{k_{in,1}}{k_{out}} + A $$\n$$ A = \\frac{k_{in,0}}{k_{out}} - \\frac{k_{in,1}}{k_{out}} = \\frac{k_{in,0} - k_{in,1}}{k_{out}} $$\nSubstituting $A$ back into the solution for $C(t)$:\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{k_{in,1}}{k_{out}} + \\left( \\frac{k_{in,0} - k_{in,1}}{k_{out}} \\right) \\exp(-k_{out} t) $$\nNow, we can find $C_{peak}$ by evaluating $C(t)$ at $t = t_{peak} = T_{on}$:\n$$ C_{peak} = C(T_{on}) = \\frac{k_{in,1}}{k_{out}} + \\left( \\frac{k_{in,0} - k_{in,1}}{k_{out}} \\right) \\exp(-k_{out} T_{on}) $$\nThis can be factored as:\n$$ C_{peak} = \\frac{1}{k_{out}} \\left( k_{in,1} + (k_{in,0} - k_{in,1}) \\exp(-k_{out} T_{on}) \\right) $$\nThe problem requires substituting $k_{out} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{t_{1/2}} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{19}$.\n$$ C_{peak} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\ln 2}{19}} \\left( k_{in,1} + (k_{in,0} - k_{in,1}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln 2}{19} T_{on}\\right) \\right) $$\n$$ C_{peak} = \\frac{19}{\\ln 2} \\left( k_{in,1} + (k_{in,0} - k_{in,1}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_{on} \\ln 2}{19}\\right) \\right) $$\nThe two results are $t_{peak} = T_{on}$ and the expression for $C_{peak}$ derived above.
