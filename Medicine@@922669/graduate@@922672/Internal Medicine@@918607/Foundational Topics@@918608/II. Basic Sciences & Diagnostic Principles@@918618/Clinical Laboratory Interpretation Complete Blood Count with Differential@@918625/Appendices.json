The relationship between these parameters is a fundamental concept in laboratory medicine. The provided numerical values are within a plausible physiological range for a human. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is free of scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\nLet $V_{\\text{blood}}$ represent a total volume of blood.\nLet $V_{\\text{RBC, total}}$ represent the total volume occupied by all red blood cells within that blood volume.\nLet $N_{\\text{RBC}}$ represent the total number of red blood cells within that blood volume.\n\nBased on the provided definitions, we can write the following relationships:\n1.  Hematocrit ($Hct$) is the ratio of the total red blood cell volume to the total blood volume:\n    $$Hct = \\frac{V_{\\text{RBC, total}}}{V_{\\text{blood}}}$$\n2.  Red Blood Cell ($RBC$) count is the number of red blood cells per unit volume of blood:\n    $$RBC = \\frac{N_{\\text{RBC}}}{V_{\\text{blood}}}$$\n3.  Mean Corpuscular Volume ($MCV$) is the average volume of a single red blood cell, which is the total red blood cell volume divided by the total number of red blood cells:\n    $$MCV = \\frac{V_{\\text{RBC, total}}}{N_{\\text{RBC}}}$$\n\nTo derive an expression for $MCV$ in terms of $Hct$ and $RBC$, we can rearrange the first two equations to express $V_{\\text{RBC, total}}$ and $N_{\\text{RBC}}$:\nFrom equation (1): $V_{\\text{RBC, total}} = Hct \\times V_{\\text{blood}}$\nFrom equation (2): $N_{\\text{RBC}} = RBC \\times V_{\\text{blood}}$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the equation for $MCV$:\n$$MCV = \\frac{Hct \\times V_{\\text{blood}}}{RBC \\times V_{\\text{blood}}}$$\nThe $V_{\\text{blood}}$ term cancels, which is expected as $MCV$ is an intrinsic property of the cells and should not depend on the total volume of the blood sample. This gives the fundamental relationship:\n$$MCV = \\frac{Hct}{RBC}$$\n\n**Unit Conversion and Calculation**\nThe next step is to perform the calculation with the given values and ensure the final units are correct.\nThe given values are:\n- $Hct = 0.39$ (dimensionless, representing L of RBCs / L of blood)\n- $RBC = 4.8 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ cells/L}$\n\nSubstituting these into our derived formula:\n$$MCV = \\frac{0.39}{4.8 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ cells/L}} = \\frac{0.39}{4.8 \\times 10^{12}} \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{cell}}$$\nThe result gives the volume in Liters (L) per cell. The problem requires the answer in femtoliters (fL). We must apply the appropriate conversion factor.\nThe prefix \"femto\" corresponds to a factor of $10^{-15}$. Therefore:\n$$1 \\text{ fL} = 10^{-15} \\text{ L}$$\nOr, equivalently:\n$$1 \\text{ L} = 10^{15} \\text{ fL}$$\nTo convert our expression for $MCV$ from L to fL, we multiply by $10^{15}$:\n$$MCV \\text{ (in fL)} = \\left(\\frac{Hct}{RBC}\\right) \\times 10^{15} \\frac{\\text{fL}}{\\text{L}}$$\nNow, we can compute the numerical value:\n$$MCV = \\left(\\frac{0.39}{4.8 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ /L}}\\right) \\times 10^{15} \\frac{\\text{fL}}{\\text{L}}$$\n$$MCV = \\frac{0.39}{4.8} \\times 10^{(15-12)} \\text{ fL}$$\n$$MCV = \\frac{0.39}{4.8} \\times 10^3 \\text{ fL}$$\n$$MCV = 0.08125 \\times 10^3 \\text{ fL}$$\n$$MCV = 81.25 \\text{ fL}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $81.25$ already has four significant figures, so no further rounding is needed.\n\n**Clinical Classification**\nFinally, we classify the result using the provided interpretive ranges:\n- Microcytosis: $MCV  80$ fL\n- Normocytosis: $80 \\le MCV \\le 100$ fL\n- Macrocytosis: $MCV > 100$ fL\n\nOur calculated value is $MCV = 81.25$ fL. Since $80 \\le 81.25 \\le 100$, the patient's red blood cells are of average size.

Validation Analysis:**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is grounded in fundamental principles of clinical hematology. The provided WBC count and differential values are physiologically plausible for a patient with an acute infection. The method for calculating absolute counts is standard medical practice.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data for the calculations. The sum of the differential percentages is $60\\% + 10\\% + 20\\% + 8\\% + 2\\% = 100\\%$, ensuring the data is internally consistent. The instructions for calculation and reporting are clear, leading to a unique set of numerical answers.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated using objective, quantitative data and standard clinical terminology. It does not contain subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n**3. Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe fundamental principle for calculating the absolute count of any leukocyte subset is to multiply the total WBC count by the fractional percentage of that subset. The general formula is:\n$$C_{abs} = C_{total} \\times \\frac{P}{100}$$\nwhere $C_{abs}$ is the absolute count of the subset, $C_{total}$ is the total WBC count, and $P$ is the percentage of the subset in the differential.\n\nThe given total WBC count is $C_{total} = 14.0 \\times 10^{9}/L$.\n\n**Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC):**\nThe percentage of lymphocytes is given as $20\\%$.\n$$ALC = (14.0 \\times 10^{9}/L) \\times \\frac{20}{100} = (14.0 \\times 10^{9}/L) \\times 0.20$$\n$$ALC = 2.80 \\times 10^{9}/L$$\n\n**Absolute Monocyte Count (AMC):**\nThe percentage of monocytes is given as $8\\%$.\n$$AMC = (14.0 \\times 10^{9}/L) \\times \\frac{8}{100} = (14.0 \\times 10^{9}/L) \\times 0.08$$\n$$AMC = 1.12 \\times 10^{9}/L$$\n\n**Absolute Eosinophil Count (AEC):**\nThe percentage of eosinophils is given as $2\\%$.\n$$AEC = (14.0 \\times 10^{9}/L) \\times \\frac{2}{100} = (14.0 \\times 10^{9}/L) \\times 0.02$$\n$$AEC = 0.280 \\times 10^{9}/L$$\n\n**Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC):**\nAs stated in the problem and per standard hematological definition, the Absolute Neutrophil Count includes both mature (segmented) neutrophils and their immediate precursors, the band forms. Therefore, the total percentage of cells in the neutrophil lineage to be used for the ANC calculation is the sum of the neutrophil and band form percentages.\n$$P_{neutrophil\\_lineage} = P_{neutrophils} + P_{bands} = 60\\% + 10\\% = 70\\%$$\nNow, we calculate the ANC:\n$$ANC = (14.0 \\times 10^{9}/L) \\times \\frac{70}{100} = (14.0 \\times 10^{9}/L) \\times 0.70$$\n$$ANC = 9.80 \\times 10^{9}/L$$\n\nAll results ($2.80$, $1.12$, $0.280$, and $9.80$) are already expressed to three significant figures.\n\n### Step 3: Clinical Interpretation\n\nThe problem also requires an interpretation of the infection susceptibility risk profile. This is based on comparing the calculated absolute counts to established clinical reference ranges.\n\n1.  **Total WBC Count:** The patient's WBC count is $14.0 \\times 10^{9}/L$. The typical reference range is approximately $4.0 - 11.0 \\times 10^{9}/L$. The patient's count is elevated, a condition known as **leukocytosis**.\n\n2.  **Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC):** The patient's ANC is $9.80 \\times 10^{9}/L$. A typical reference range for ANC is approximately $1.8 - 7.7 \\times 10^{9}/L$. The patient's count is significantly elevated, a condition known as **neutrophilia**. Neutrophilia is a hallmark of the body's response to an acute bacterial infection. Infection susceptibility risk is actually *decreased* in a sense, as the body has mounted a robust defense; the primary clinical concern is the severity of the underlying infection causing this response, not a failure of the immune system. Neutropenia (low neutrophil count, typically $ANC  1.5 \\times 10^{9}/L$) is the condition that confers a high risk of infection. This patient is not neutropenic.\n\n3.  **Band Forms (Bandemia):** The percentage of band forms is $10\\%$. An increase in immature neutrophils is called a \"left shift\" or **bandemia**. Clinically, bandemia is often defined as a band percentage $10\\%$ of total WBCs or an absolute band count $0.7 \\times 10^9/L$. The patient's absolute band count is $(14.0 \\times 10^{9}/L) \\times 0.10 = 1.4 \\times 10^{9}/L$, confirming significant bandemia. This indicates that the bone marrow is under stress to produce neutrophils rapidly in response to an acute inflammatory stimulus, most commonly a bacterial infection.\n\n**Conclusion on Risk Profile:** The constellation of findings (leukocytosis, marked neutrophilia, and significant bandemia) does not indicate an increased susceptibility to infection due to a compromised immune system. On the contrary, it signals a strong, active immunological response to a significant ongoing pathological process, most likely an acute bacterial infection. The patient's risk profile is dominated by the severity and nature of this underlying illness, not by immunodeficiency.\n\nThe final numerical answers requested are the absolute counts for ANC, ALC, AMC, and AEC.\n- $ANC = 9.80 \\times 10^{9}/L$\n- $ALC = 2.80 \\times 10^{9}/L$\n- $AMC = 1.12 \\times 10^{9}/L$\n- $AEC = 0.280 \\times 10^{9}/L$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n9.80  2.80  1.12  0.280\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4813638"}, {"introduction": "A key skill in modern medicine is understanding the limitations of automated laboratory technology and knowing how to correct for common artifacts.

It describes a realistic clinical laboratory challenge that can be solved using standard, well-established principles and formulas. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**First Principles of Impedance-Based WBC Counting**\nThe Coulter principle, a form of impedance counting, is used for enumerating cells. For the WBC count, a specific protocol is followed:\n1.  A precise volume of whole blood is mixed with a diluent and a lytic reagent.\n2.  This lytic reagent rapidly destroys the cell membranes of non-nucleated red blood cells (RBCs), leaving only small fragments of stroma that are below the detection threshold of the counter.\n3.  White blood cells (leukocytes) are more resistant to this lysis. Their cytoplasm is stripped away, but their nuclei remain largely intact.\n4.  The suspension containing these bare nuclei is drawn through a small aperture across which an electrical current is maintained.\n5.  Each nucleus, being a poor conductor of electricity compared to the saline-based diluent, momentarily increases the electrical impedance as it passes through the aperture.\n6.  The instrument detects each impedance change as a voltage pulse, and the number of pulses is counted. This raw count is then scaled by the dilution factor to report the concentration of cells per unit volume (e.g., cells/$\\mu\\text{L}$).\n\n**Mechanism of NRBC Interference**\nNucleated Red Blood Cells (NRBCs) are immature erythrocyte precursors that, unlike mature RBCs, still contain a nucleus. When a blood sample containing NRBCs is processed in the WBC channel of an impedance counter:\n- The lytic agent lyses the mature RBCs as intended.\n- However, the nuclei of the NRBCs are resistant to lysis, similar to the nuclei of WBCs.\n- Consequently, the instrument's detector cannot distinguish between a WBC nucleus and an NRBC nucleus passing through the aperture. Both generate a pulse.\n- The resulting \"WBC count\", which we have denoted as $WBC_{\\text{measured}}$, is therefore not a true count of leukocytes but a total count of all nucleated cells in the sample.\n$$WBC_{\\text{measured}} = (\\text{True WBC Count}) + (\\text{NRBC Count})$$\nThis leads to a spurious elevation of the reported WBC count.\n\n**Derivation of the Correction Formula**\nThe laboratory quantifies the extent of this interference by performing a manual differential count on a stained peripheral blood smear. In this process, a technologist counts $100$ sequential WBCs and simultaneously notes how many NRBCs are seen during that count. This gives a ratio, which we'll call $N_{NRBC}$, expressed as \"NRBCs per $100$ WBCs\".\n\nLet $W_{\\text{true}}$ be the true concentration of WBCs and $N_{\\text{true}}$ be the true concentration of NRBCs in the patient's blood.\nThe measured count is $WBC_{\\text{measured}} = W_{\\text{true}} + N_{\\text{true}}$.\nThe manual differential gives the ratio:\n$$\\frac{N_{\\text{true}}}{W_{\\text{true}}} = \\frac{N_{NRBC}}{100}$$\nFrom this ratio, we can express $N_{\\text{true}}$ in terms of $W_{\\text{true}}$:\n$$N_{\\text{true}} = W_{\\text{true}} \\times \\frac{N_{NRBC}}{100}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $N_{\\text{true}}$ into the equation for the measured count:\n$$WBC_{\\text{measured}} = W_{\\text{true}} + \\left(W_{\\text{true}} \\times \\frac{N_{NRBC}}{100}\\right)$$\nFactor out $W_{\\text{true}}$:\n$$WBC_{\\text{measured}} = W_{\\text{true}} \\left(1 + \\frac{N_{NRBC}}{100}\\right)$$\n$$WBC_{\\text{measured}} = W_{\\text{true}} \\left(\\frac{100 + N_{NRBC}}{100}\\right)$$\nOur goal is to find the corrected (true) WBC count, $W_{\\text{true}}$ (which we can call $WBC_{\\text{corrected}}$). We rearrange the equation to solve for $W_{\\text{true}}$:\n$$WBC_{\\text{corrected}} = W_{\\text{true}} = WBC_{\\text{measured}} \\times \\left(\\frac{100}{100 + N_{NRBC}}\\right)$$\nThis is the standard formula for correcting the WBC count for the presence of NRBCs.\n\n**Calculation**\nUsing the given data:\n- $WBC_{\\text{measured}} = 18.0 \\times 10^{3} / \\mu\\text{L}$\n- $N_{NRBC} = 35$ per $100$ WBC\n\nWe apply the derived formula:\n$$WBC_{\\text{corrected}} = (18.0 \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}) \\times \\frac{100}{100 + 35}$$\n$$WBC_{\\text{corrected}} = (18.0 \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}) \\times \\frac{100}{135}$$\n$$WBC_{\\text{corrected}} = 18.0 \\times \\frac{20}{27} \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}$$\n$$WBC_{\\text{corrected}} \\approx 18.0 \\times 0.74074... \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}$$\n$$WBC_{\\text{corrected}} \\approx 13.333... \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}$$\nRounding to one decimal place, consistent with the precision of the input data:\n$$WBC_{\\text{corrected}} \\approx 13.3 \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In the impedance (Coulter) WBC channel, most Red Blood Cells (RBCs) are lysed, but NRBCs that retain an intact nucleus and sufficient volume are detected as leukocytes; therefore the measured WBC includes true WBC plus NRBC. The correction should scale the measured WBC by the factor that removes the NRBC contribution relative to $100$ WBC: $$WBC_{\\text{corrected}}=WBC_{\\text{measured}}\\times \\frac{100}{100+\\text{NRBC per 100 WBC}},$$ yielding $$18.0\\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}\\times \\frac{100}{135}\\approx 13.3\\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}.$$**\n- **Mechanism**: The explanation is scientifically accurate.

NRBCs lower the measured WBC because they cause coincidence loss of leukocytes in the aperture; the appropriate correction inflates the measured WBC by $$WBC_{\\text{corrected}}=WBC_{\\text{measured}}\\times \\frac{100+\\text{NRBC per 100 WBC}}{100},$$ giving $$18.0\\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}\\times \\frac{135}{100}=24.3\\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}.$$**\n- **Mechanism**: The proposed mechanism is incorrect. NRBCs are counted *as* WBCs, thus they *increase*, not lower, the measured count. Coincidence loss is a separate phenomenon that occurs at very high cell concentrations, but it is not the primary interference mechanism of NRBCs, nor does it cause a lowering of the count in this context.\n- **Formula**: The formula is the inverse of the correct one, leading to a further, erroneous inflation of the count.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Impedance thresholds qualitatively exclude NRBCs from the WBC channel, so no numerical correction is needed and $$WBC_{\\text{corrected}}=WBC_{\\text{measured}}=18.0\\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}.$$**\n- **Mechanism**: This statement is false. Basic impedance counters cannot reliably distinguish stripped NRBC nuclei from small lymphocytes based on size (impedance pulse amplitude) alone. Therefore, NRBCs are *included* in the count, not excluded. A numerical correction is the standard of care when NRBCs are present in significant numbers ($5$ per $100$ WBC is a common threshold for correction).\n- **Formula/Result**: Proposing no correction is clinically and technically incorrect.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. NRBCs increase the measured WBC; a simple subtraction using the NRBC proportion is sufficient: $$WBC_{\\text{corrected}}=WBC_{\\text{measured}}-WBC_{\\text{measured}}\\times \\frac{\\text{NRBC per 100 WBC}}{100},$$ yielding $$18.0\\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}\\times (1-0.35)=11.7\\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\text{L}.$$**\n- **Mechanism**: The initial statement that \"NRBCs increase the measured WBC\" is correct.\n- **Formula**: The proposed formula is mathematically incorrect.
