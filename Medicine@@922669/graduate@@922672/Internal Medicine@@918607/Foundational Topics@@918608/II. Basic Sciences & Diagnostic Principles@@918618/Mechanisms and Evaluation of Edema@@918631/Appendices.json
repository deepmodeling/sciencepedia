The endothelial barrier behaves as a semipermeable membrane to plasma proteins due to an intact endothelial glycocalyx, while being permeable to water. The volumetric solvent flux across such a membrane depends on the balance of mechanical (hydrostatic) and osmotic driving forces, modified by the degree to which solutes are reflected by the membrane. The hydraulic conductivity per unit area is denoted by $L_{p}$, the available surface area by $S$, the capillary hydrostatic pressure by $P_{c}$, the interstitial hydrostatic pressure by $P_{i}$, the transendothelial solute reflection coefficient by $\\sigma$, the plasma oncotic pressure by $\\pi_{c}$, and the subglycocalyx oncotic pressure adjacent to the endothelial surface by $\\pi_{g}$.

All variables are defined, and the sign convention is explicitly stated.\n- **Conclusion:** The problem does not violate any criteria for invalidity. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe net volumetric solvent flux, $J_{v}$, across a semipermeable membrane is proportional to the net driving pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{net}}$. The constant of proportionality is the hydraulic conductance of the membrane, which is the product of the hydraulic conductivity per unit area, $L_{p}$, and the total surface area available for filtration, $S$.\n$$J_{v} = L_{p} S (\\Delta P_{\\text{net}})$$\nThe net driving pressure is the sum of the hydrostatic pressure gradient and the effective oncotic (osmotic) pressure gradient across the endothelial barrier.\n\n$1$. **Hydrostatic Pressure Gradient ($\\Delta P_{\\text{hydrostatic}}$):** This is the difference between the hydrostatic pressure inside the capillary ($P_{c}$) and the hydrostatic pressure in the surrounding interstitial fluid ($P_{i}$). This gradient drives fluid out of the capillary.\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{hydrostatic}} = P_{c} - P_{i}$$\n\n$2$. **Effective Oncotic Pressure Gradient ($\\Delta \\pi_{\\text{effective}}$):** The oncotic pressure is generated by macromolecules (primarily proteins) that are partially or fully reflected by the membrane. The pressure difference across the membrane is between the plasma oncotic pressure ($\\pi_{c}$) and the oncotic pressure in the fluid-filled space immediately adjacent to the abluminal side of the endothelium, which is the subglycocalyx space ($\\pi_{g}$). This pressure gradient, $\\pi_{c} - \\pi_{g}$, tends to draw fluid into the capillary, thus opposing filtration. The effectiveness of this osmotic gradient is modulated by the reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$, which quantifies the leakiness of the membrane to the solutes. A $\\sigma$ of $1$ indicates a perfectly impermeable membrane, while a $\\sigma$ of $0$ indicates a freely permeable membrane. The force exerted by the oncotic pressure gradient that opposes filtration is therefore:\n$$\\Delta \\pi_{\\text{effective}} = \\sigma (\\pi_{c} - \\pi_{g})$$\nThis term represents a force that draws fluid inward, so it is subtracted from the outward-driving hydrostatic force.\n\n$3$. **Net Driving Pressure ($\\Delta P_{\\text{net}}$):** Combining the hydrostatic and effective oncotic pressure gradients gives the net pressure driving filtration.\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{net}} = \\Delta P_{\\text{hydrostatic}} - \\Delta \\pi_{\\text{effective}}$$\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{net}} = (P_{c} - P_{i}) - \\sigma(\\pi_{c} - \\pi_{g})$$\n\n$4$. **Final Expression for Volumetric Flux ($J_{v}$):** Substituting the expression for the net driving pressure into the initial flux equation yields the revised Starling equation:\n$$J_{v} = L_{p} S [ (P_{c} - P_{i}) - \\sigma(\\pi_{c} - \\pi_{g}) ]$$\nThis is the required derived expression.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nWe now substitute the provided numerical values into the derived equation. The units are consistent, with all pressures in mmHg and the hydraulic conductance in mL/(min·mmHg), resulting in a flux $J_{v}$ in mL/min.\n\nGiven values:\n- $L_{p} S = 0.01 \\, \\text{mL/(min·mmHg)}$\n- $P_{c} = 30 \\, \\text{mmHg}$\n- $P_{i} = -2 \\, \\text{mmHg}$\n- $\\sigma = 0.9$\n- $\\pi_{c} = 25 \\, \\text{mmHg}$\n- $\\pi_{g} = 5 \\, \\text{mmHg}$\n\nFirst, calculate the hydrostatic pressure difference:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{hydrostatic}} = P_{c} - P_{i} = 30 \\, \\text{mmHg} - (-2 \\, \\text{mmHg}) = 32 \\, \\text{mmHg}$$\nNext, calculate the effective oncotic pressure difference:\n$$\\Delta \\pi_{\\text{effective}} = \\sigma(\\pi_{c} - \\pi_{g}) = 0.9 (25 \\, \\text{mmHg} - 5 \\, \\text{mmHg}) = 0.9 (20 \\, \\text{mmHg}) = 18 \\, \\text{mmHg}$$\nNow, calculate the net driving pressure:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{net}} = \\Delta P_{\\text{hydrostatic}} - \\Delta \\pi_{\\text{effective}} = 32 \\, \\text{mmHg} - 18 \\, \\text{mmHg} = 14 \\, \\text{mmHg}$$\nFinally, calculate the volumetric flux $J_{v}$:\n$$J_{v} = (L_{p} S) \\times (\\Delta P_{\\text{net}}) = (0.01 \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min} \\cdot \\text{mmHg}}) \\times (14 \\, \\text{mmHg})$$\n$$J_{v} = 0.14 \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore,\n$$J_{v} = 0.140 \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}}$$\n\n### Interpretation of the Result\nThe calculated value for the flux is $J_{v} = +0.140$ mL/min. According to the problem's stated sign convention, a positive value for $J_{v}$ indicates net movement of fluid from the capillary lumen into the interstitium.

This confirms that both patients have ascites resulting from portal hypertension. The next step is to differentiate the cause of the portal hypertension. The problem specifies discriminating between cirrhotic and cardiogenic ascites. This differentiation can be made by examining the total protein concentration in the ascitic fluid.\n\nThe underlying pathophysiology is as follows:\n- In **cirrhosis**, the liver's architecture is distorted, which increases sinusoidal pressure. However, the sinusoids are leaky, and the damaged liver produces less protein (hypoalbuminemia is common). The combination of these factors results in ascitic fluid with a low protein concentration. A standard clinical cutoff for ascitic fluid total protein in this context is $ 2.5\\,\\text{g/dL}$.\n- In **cardiogenic ascites**, elevated right-sided heart pressures lead to hepatic congestion and increased post-sinusoidal pressure. The liver structure and synthetic function are initially preserved. The intact, but congested, hepatic sinusoids leak a protein-rich fluid into the peritoneal cavity. Thus, cardiogenic ascites is characterized by a high ascitic fluid total protein concentration, typically $\\ge 2.5\\,\\text{g/dL}$.\n\nNow we apply this secondary criterion to our patients:\n- **Patient X**: $\\text{SAAG}_X = 1.3\\,\\text{g/dL}$ (high) and $A_{prot,X} = 3.1\\,\\text{g/dL}$. Since the ascitic total protein is $\\ge 2.5\\,\\text{g/dL}$, this profile is consistent with **cardiogenic ascites**.\n- **Patient Y**: $\\text{SAAG}_Y = 1.4\\,\\text{g/dL}$ (high) and $A_{prot,Y} = 1.9\\,\\text{g/dL}$.

On examination, there is localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system in the calf, a calf circumference difference of $3.5$ $\\mathrm{cm}$ compared to the right, pitting edema confined to the left leg, and dilated superficial collateral veins over the distal thigh. Skin over the calf is warm without fluctuance; there is no trauma. She had a long-haul flight $5$ days ago and has a history of a prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT) $10$ years ago. She has no active cancer and is not currently immobilized. Vital signs are normal. Laboratory evaluation is pending. The clinician aims to integrate mechanistic understanding of edema formation, construct a differential diagnosis for unilateral leg edema, and apply a pretest probability approach using the Wells score for DVT to select the next diagnostic test across probability strata. \n\nStarting from fundamental capillary fluid exchange, edema arises when net transvascular fluid flux $J_v$ into the interstitium exceeds lymphatic return, where \n$$J_v = K_f\\left[(P_c - P_i) - \\sigma(\\pi_c - \\pi_i)\\right],$$ \nwith $K_f$ the capillary filtration coefficient, $P_c$ capillary hydrostatic pressure, $P_i$ interstitial hydrostatic pressure, $\\sigma$ the reflection coefficient, and $\\pi_c$ and $\\pi_i$ the capillary and interstitial oncotic pressures, respectively. In unilateral leg edema, mechanisms are typically localized: increased venous hydrostatic pressure due to venous obstruction (e.g., DVT, iliac vein compression), increased capillary permeability from inflammation (e.g., cellulitis), impaired lymphatic drainage (e.g., lymphedema), or local tissue injury (e.g., muscle strain, ruptured Baker cyst). Systemic causes that lower $\\pi_c$ (e.g., hypoalbuminemia) or raise $P_c$ globally (e.g., congestive heart failure) characteristically produce bilateral edema.\n\nThe Wells score for DVT (clinical prediction rule) assigns points to risk features and subtracts points if an alternative diagnosis is at least as likely. In two-tier interpretations, DVT is “likely” at a threshold of $\\ge 2$ points and “unlikely” at $2$ points, whereas in three-tier interpretations low probability is $\\le 0$, moderate is $1$–$2$, and high is $\\ge 3$.

It grounds the discussion in the fundamental physiology of edema formation using the Starling equation: $J_v = K_f\\left[(P_c - P_i) - \\sigma(\\pi_c - \\pi_i)\\right]$. It correctly differentiates the local mechanisms of unilateral edema (e.g., venous obstruction increasing $P_c$) from systemic causes of bilateral edema (e.g., hypoalbuminemia decreasing $\\pi_c$).

The task is to evaluate proposed integrated strategies.\n\nThe provided information is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and well-posed. The clinical scenario is realistic. The physiological principles are correct. The diagnostic tools and risk stratification model (Wells score) are central to the modern evaluation of suspected DVT. The problem is a valid exercise in clinical reasoning, integrating pathophysiology with evidence-based medicine.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the Clinical Case and Principles\n\nFirst, let's calculate the patient's Wells score to determine her pretest probability of DVT. The standard Wells score criteria are applied to the provided clinical information:\n- Active cancer: No ($0$ points)\n- Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization: No ($0$ points)\n- Recently bedridden $\\ge 3$ days or major surgery within $12$ weeks: No ($0$ points)\n- Localized tenderness along the deep venous system: Yes ($+1$ point)\n- Entire leg swollen: Yes ($+1$ point)\n- Calf swelling by $3$ $\\mathrm{cm}$ compared to the other leg: Yes ($3.5$ $\\mathrm{cm}$, so $+1$ point)\n- Pitting edema (confined to symptomatic leg): Yes ($+1$ point)\n- Collateral superficial veins (nonvaricose): Yes ($+1$ point)\n- Previously documented DVT: Yes ($+1$ point)\n- An alternative diagnosis is at least as likely as DVT: No. The presentation is classic for a DVT, making an alternative diagnosis less likely. ($-2$ points do not apply, so $0$ points for this criterion).\n\nThe total score is $1+1+1+1+1+1 = 6$.\nAccording to the three-tier interpretation provided ($ \\le 0$ low, $1-2$ moderate, $\\ge 3$ high), a score of $6$ places this patient in the **high pretest probability** category.\n\nNext, we establish the evidence-based diagnostic pathway based on pretest probability:\n- **Low Probability (Wells score $\\le 0$):** High-sensitivity D-dimer assay is the test of choice. A negative result reliably rules out DVT, and no further testing is necessary. A positive result has low specificity and requires follow-up with imaging, typically compression ultrasonography (CUS).\n- **Moderate Probability (Wells score $1-2$):** Two main strategies are accepted. One is to start with a high-sensitivity D-dimer, as in the low-probability group. The other is to proceed directly to CUS. The choice may depend on local resources and protocols. If CUS is the initial test and is negative, but clinical suspicion remains (or a D-dimer was positive), serial CUS in $5-7$ days is often recommended.\n- **High Probability (Wells score $\\ge 3$):** The pretest probability is sufficiently high that a D-dimer test is not useful for ruling out DVT (its negative predictive value is inadequate). The standard of care is to proceed directly with imaging (CUS). If clinical suspicion is very high, as in this case, initiating anticoagulation while awaiting imaging may be indicated if there are no contraindications. If the initial proximal CUS is negative, the high pretest probability warrants further investigation, such as repeating the CUS in $5-7$ days (to detect a propagating distal DVT) or using advanced imaging (CT or MR venography) to assess for isolated iliac vein thrombosis.\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Differential emphasizes systemic hypoalbuminemia and congestive heart failure for unilateral edema; testing plan: low Wells ($\\le 0$) proceeds directly to proximal compression ultrasonography; moderate Wells ($1$–$2$) relies solely on D-dimer to exclude DVT; high Wells ($\\ge 3$) orders D-dimer first and performs ultrasonography only if D-dimer is positive.**\n\n- **Differential Diagnosis:** This is physiologically incorrect. Systemic causes like low albumin (decreased $\\pi_c$) and heart failure (globally increased $P_c$) cause bilateral, not unilateral, edema.\n- **Testing Plan:** The proposed plan is incorrect for all strata. For low probability, D-dimer should precede CUS. For moderate probability, relying \"solely\" on D-dimer is dangerous; a positive D-dimer mandates imaging. For high probability, D-dimer is not recommended; CUS should be the initial test.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Differential categorizes local mechanisms: increased venous hydrostatic pressure (DVT, iliac vein compression syndrome), lymphatic insufficiency (primary or secondary lymphedema), inflammatory permeability increases (cellulitis), musculoskeletal causes (muscle strain/hematoma, ruptured Baker cyst), and superficial thrombophlebitis; testing plan: low Wells ($\\le 0$) obtain a high-sensitivity D-dimer and, if negative, no imaging; if positive, perform proximal compression ultrasonography; moderate Wells ($1$–$2$) perform proximal or whole-leg duplex ultrasonography as the next test; if initial ultrasonography is negative but D-dimer is positive or clinical suspicion persists, repeat ultrasonography in $5$–$7$ days; high Wells ($\\ge 3$) initiate anticoagulation if not contraindicated and perform urgent proximal compression ultrasonography; if negative yet suspicion remains, obtain whole-leg ultrasonography or computed tomography/magnetic resonance venography for iliac/pelvic veins and repeat ultrasonography in $5$–$7$ days.**\n\n- **Differential Diagnosis:** This is an excellent, comprehensive, and etiologically organized differential for unilateral leg edema, consistent with the pathophysiological principles provided.\n- **Testing Plan:** The plan is fully aligned with evidence-based guidelines.\n    - **Low probability:** Correctly uses D-dimer to rule out DVT.\n    - **Moderate probability:** Proposes a valid strategy of proceeding to ultrasonography, with appropriate follow-up (serial imaging) for a negative result with persistent suspicion.\n    - **High probability:** Correctly bypasses D-dimer, proceeds directly to CUS, considers empiric anticoagulation, and has a robust plan for a negative CUS in the face of high clinical suspicion (serial CUS or advanced imaging).\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C.

Low probability requires testing (D-dimer). Moderate probability requires investigation of the leg (CUS), not the chest (CTPA is for pulmonary embolism). High probability is investigated with CUS, not with outdated, invasive contrast venography as a first-line test.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Differential includes lipedema as a primary unilateral cause and excludes ruptured Baker cyst; testing plan: low Wells ($\\le 0$) uses ultrasonography only if D-dimer is positive; moderate Wells ($1$–$2$) uses D-dimer to rule out and does not image with a positive D-dimer; high Wells ($\\ge 3$) uses age-adjusted D-dimer alone to exclude DVT; a single negative ultrasonography suffices in high probability without repeat imaging.**\n\n- **Differential Diagnosis:** The differential is flawed. Lipedema is characteristically bilateral and symmetric. Excluding a ruptured Baker cyst, a key DVT mimic, is an error.\n- **Testing Plan:** The plan contains critical errors. For moderate probability, a positive D-dimer necessitates imaging; stating it is used to \"rule out\" and then not imaging is a contradiction and is dangerous. For high probability, D-dimer (age-adjusted or not) is inappropriate for ruling out DVT. Stating a single negative CUS is sufficient in a high-probability patient contradicts safety guidelines.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B presents a correct differential diagnosis and a fully evidence-based, safe, and effective diagnostic strategy for all strata of DVT risk.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4866656"}]}
