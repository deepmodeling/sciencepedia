The reserve will be depleted because consumption ($C = 1.2$ $\\mathrm{mmol/min}$) exceeds generation ($G = 0.5$ $\\mathrm{mmol/min}$). Once the reserve $S(t)$ reaches zero, the only available ATP supply is the generation rate $G = 0.5$ $\\mathrm{mmol/min}$. This rate is insufficient to meet the total demand $C = 1.2$ $\\mathrm{mmol/min}$, the non-pump demand of $0.9$ $\\mathrm{mmol/min}$, or even the combined demand.

The problem is therefore logically consistent and solvable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem is governed by the principle of conservation for the intracellular ATP reserve, $S(t)$. The time rate of change of the reserve is the difference between the rate of ATP generation and the rate of ATP consumption.\n\nLet $S(t)$ be the amount of ATP in the reserve pool at time $t$.

The rate of deficit accumulation is constant and given by:\n$$ R_{\\text{deficit}} = C - G $$\nThe total net ATP deficit, $D_{\\text{net}}$, accumulated over the time interval $\\Delta t = 20\\,\\mathrm{min}$ is the integral of this rate from $t=0$ to $t=\\Delta t$:\n$$ D_{\\text{net}} = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} (C - G) dt $$\nSince $C$ and $G$ are time-invariant, the integral simplifies to:\n$$ D_{\\text{net}} = (C - G) \\Delta t $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n- $C = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{mmol/min}$\n- $G = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mmol/min}$\n- $\\Delta t = 20\\,\\mathrm{min}$\n\n$$ D_{\\text{net}} = (1.2 - 0.5)\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}}{\\mathrm{min}} \\times 20\\,\\mathrm{min} = 0.7\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}}{\\mathrm{min}} \\times 20\\,\\mathrm{min} = 14\\,\\mathrm{mmol} $$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures. Thus, the net deficit is $14.00\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$.\n\n**2) Time to Na/K ATPase failure**\n\nAs established during validation, cellular failure, including that of the Na/K ATPase, occurs at the time $t_{\\text{fail}}$ when the ATP reserve $S(t)$ is completely depleted, i.e., $S(t_{\\text{fail}}) = 0$. At this point, the supply rate drops to $G$, which is insufficient to meet the demand $C$.\n\nTo find $t_{\\text{fail}}$, we solve the differential equation $\\frac{dS}{dt} = G - C$ with the initial condition $S(0) = S_{0}$. We integrate from $t=0$ to $t=t_{\\text{fail}}$:\n$$ \\int_{S(0)}^{S(t_{\\text{fail}})} dS = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\text{fail}}} (G - C) dt $$\n$$ S(t_{\\text{fail}}) - S(0) = (G - C) t_{\\text{fail}} $$\nSubstituting the conditions $S(0) = S_0$ and $S(t_{\\text{fail}}) = 0$:\n$$ 0 - S_0 = (G - C) t_{\\text{fail}} $$\nSolving for $t_{\\text{fail}}$:\n$$ t_{\\text{fail}} = \\frac{-S_0}{G - C} = \\frac{S_0}{C - G} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n- $S_0 = 12\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$\n- $C = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{mmol/min}$\n- $G = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mmol/min}$\n\n$$ t_{\\text{fail}} = \\frac{12\\,\\mathrm{mmol}}{(1.2 - 0.5)\\,\\mathrm{mmol/min}} = \\frac{12}{0.7}\\,\\mathrm{min} \\approx 17.142857\\,\\mathrm{min} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the time to failure is $17.14\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\n\nThe net deficit of $14\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$ exceeds the initial reserve of $12\\,\\mathrm{mmol}$, which is consistent with the finding that the reserve is depleted before the $20$-minute mark at $t_{\\text{fail}} \\approx 17.14\\,\\mathrm{min}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n14.00 & 17.14\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4867340"}, {"introduction": "Ischemia-reperfusion injury is largely mediated by a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon restoration of blood flow.
