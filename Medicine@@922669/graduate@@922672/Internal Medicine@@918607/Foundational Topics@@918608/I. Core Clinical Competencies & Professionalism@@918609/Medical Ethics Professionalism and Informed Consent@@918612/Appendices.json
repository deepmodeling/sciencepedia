The concepts of absolute risk, relative risk, ARR, RRR, and NNT are standard, essential metrics in clinical epidemiology and evidence-based medicine. The context provided (informed consent, ethics) is a valid and critical application area for these metrics. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data ($p_0$ and $p_1$) and clearly defines the required outputs. The instruction for calculating the NNT as a ceiling integer (`the smallest integer greater than or equal to...`) removes any ambiguity. A unique and stable solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. The ethical framing serves as a valid justification for the calculation and does not introduce subjectivity into the mathematical task.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no identifiable flaws. It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of three key epidemiological metrics from first principles. Let us define the risk of an adverse event (in this case, one-year all-cause mortality) as a probability.\n\nLet $R_c$ be the risk in the control (unexposed/untreated) group. This corresponds to the mortality probability without the beta-blocker.\n$$R_c = p_0 = 0.10$$\n\nLet $R_t$ be the risk in the treatment (exposed/treated) group. This corresponds to the mortality probability with the beta-blocker.\n$$R_t = p_1 = 0.07$$\n\n**1. Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)**\n\nFrom first principles, the \"reduction\" in risk is the arithmetic difference between the baseline risk and the risk under treatment. The \"absolute\" nature of this reduction implies we are interested in the simple difference in probabilities, not a ratio. Therefore, the Absolute Risk Reduction is defined as the risk in the control group minus the risk in the treatment group.\n\n$$ARR = R_c - R_t$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ARR = 0.10 - 0.07 = 0.03$$\n\nThis quantity represents the absolute decrease in the probability of the adverse outcome attributable to the intervention.\n\n**2. Relative Risk Reduction (RRR)**\n\nThe \"relative\" reduction in risk contextualizes the absolute reduction against the baseline risk. It answers the question: \"By what fraction did the baseline risk decrease?\" It is calculated by dividing the absolute risk reduction by the risk in the control group.\n\n$$RRR = \\frac{\\text{Absolute Risk Reduction}}{\\text{Risk in Control Group}} = \\frac{ARR}{R_c}$$\n\nSubstituting the definitional formula for $ARR$:\n$$RRR = \\frac{R_c - R_t}{R_c}$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$RRR = \\frac{0.10 - 0.07}{0.10} = \\frac{0.03}{0.10} = 0.3$$\n\nThis quantity means the treatment reduces the baseline risk of mortality by $30\\%$.\n\n**3. Number Needed to Treat (NNT)**\n\nThe NNT is an inversion of the ARR. If the ARR is the number of adverse events prevented per person treated (on average), then its reciprocal, $\\frac{1}{ARR}$, represents the number of people that must be treated to prevent one adverse event. For instance, if $ARR = 0.03$, this implies that for every $100$ people treated, $3$ events are prevented. The number of people to treat to prevent $1$ event is therefore $\\frac{100}{3}$.\n\nFrom first principles, the NNT is the reciprocal of the ARR.\n$$NNT_{\\text{raw}} = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\n\nThe problem specifies the use of the conventional clinical integer definition, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to this reciprocal value. This is mathematically equivalent to the ceiling function, denoted by $\\lceil \\cdot \\rceil$. This convention is adopted because one cannot treat a fraction of a person, and rounding down would overstate the treatment's efficacy (e.g., stating that treating $33$ people prevents one event when in fact it takes more than $33$).\n\n$$NNT = \\left\\lceil \\frac{1}{ARR} \\right\\rceil$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated value for $ARR$:\n$$NNT = \\left\\lceil \\frac{1}{0.03} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{100}{3} \\right\\rceil = \\lceil 33.333... \\rceil$$\n\nThe smallest integer greater than or equal to $33.333...$ is $34$.\n$$NNT = 34$$\n\nThis means that, on average, $34$ patients must be treated with the beta-blocker for one year to prevent one additional death.\n\nThe final values are:\n- ARR = $0.03$\n- RRR = $0.3$\n- NNT = $34$\n\nThese are reported as a single row vector as requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.03 & 0.3 & 34 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4868919"}, {"introduction": "Effective shared decision-making rarely involves a simple \"yes\" or \"no\"; it requires balancing potential benefits against potential harms.

We will proceed by first calculating the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) and the Number Needed to Harm (NNH) from first principles, and then discussing the communication of these results within the framework of medical ethics.\n\nLet $p_{\\text{MACE, std}}$ be the probability of a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) under standard care, and $p_{\\text{MACE, ther}}$ be the probability with therapy.

For a given event with probability $p$, the expected number of events, $E$, in a cohort of size $n$ is $E = n \\times p$.\n\nFirst, we derive the NNT. The NNT is defined as the cohort size $n$ required to prevent one additional primary event (MACE) compared to standard care.\nThe expected number of MACE events in a cohort of size $n$ under standard care is $E_{\\text{MACE, std}} = n \\times p_{\\text{MACE, std}}$.\nThe expected number of MACE events in a cohort of size $n$ with therapy is $E_{\\text{MACE, ther}} = n \\times p_{\\text{MACE, ther}}$.\nThe number of events prevented by the therapy in this cohort is the difference:\n$$\\text{Events Prevented} = E_{\\text{MACE, std}} - E_{\\text{MACE, ther}} = n \\times p_{\\text{MACE, std}} - n \\times p_{\\text{MACE, ther}} = n \\times (p_{\\text{MACE, std}} - p_{\\text{MACE, ther}})$$\nThe term $(p_{\\text{MACE, std}} - p_{\\text{MACE, ther}})$ is the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR).\n$$\\text{ARR} = p_{\\text{MACE, std}} - p_{\\text{MACE, ther}}$$\nBy definition, the NNT is the value of $n$ for which the number of events prevented is exactly $1$.\n$$1 = \\text{NNT} \\times \\text{ARR}$$\nSolving for NNT, we get:\n$$\\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{\\text{ARR}} = \\frac{1}{p_{\\text{MACE, std}} - p_{\\text{MACE, ther}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{0.20 - 0.15} = \\frac{1}{0.05} = 20$$\n\nNext, we derive the NNH. The NNH is defined as the cohort size $n$ that yields one additional harm (major bleeding event) attributable to the therapy.\nThe expected number of major bleeding events in a cohort of size $n$ under standard care is $E_{\\text{bleed, std}} = n \\times p_{\\text{bleed, std}}$.\nThe expected number of major bleeding events in a cohort of size $n$ with therapy is $E_{\\text{bleed, ther}} = n \\times p_{\\text{bleed, ther}}$.\nThe number of additional harms caused by the therapy in this cohort is the difference:\n$$\\text{Additional Harms} = E_{\\text{bleed, ther}} - E_{\\text{bleed, std}} = n \\times p_{\\text{bleed, ther}} - n \\times p_{\\text{bleed, std}} = n \\times (p_{\\text{bleed, ther}} - p_{\\text{bleed, std}})$$\nThe term $(p_{\\text{bleed, ther}} - p_{\\text{bleed, std}})$ is the Absolute Risk Increase (ARI).\n$$\\text{ARI} = p_{\\text{bleed, ther}} - p_{\\text{bleed, std}}$$\nBy definition, the NNH is the value of $n$ for which the number of additional harms is exactly $1$.\n$$1 = \\text{NNH} \\times \\text{ARI}$$\nSolving for NNH, we get:\n$$\\text{NNH} = \\frac{1}{\\text{ARI}} = \\frac{1}{p_{\\text{bleed, ther}} - p_{\\text{bleed, std}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\text{NNH} = \\frac{1}{0.03 - 0.01} = \\frac{1}{0.02} = 50$$\n\nThe calculated values are $\\text{NNT} = 20$ and $\\text{NNH} = 50$.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires an explanation of how these figures should be communicated during ethically valid informed consent, grounded in the principles of patient autonomy, beneficence, and nonmaleficence.\n\nThe derived values, $\\text{NNT} = 20$ and $\\text{NNH} = 50$, quantify the trade-off between the therapy's benefit and its harm at a population level. Ethically sound communication must translate these statistics into a format that is understandable to the patient, thereby respecting their autonomy to make a decision aligned with their personal values.\n\n$1$. **Respect for Autonomy**: The physician's role is to provide clear, unbiased information, empowering the patient to be the ultimate decision-maker. This is achieved by avoiding jargon and presenting risks in absolute and frequentist terms. Instead of simply stating \"the NNT is 20,\" the information should be framed concretely. For example: \"Let's imagine $100$ people with your condition. Based on the studies, here is what we expect would happen over one year. Without this therapy, we would expect about $20$ of the $100$ people to have a major heart or blood vessel event. With the therapy, we would expect that number to drop to about $15$. This means that for every $100$ people who take this therapy for a year, about $5$ of them are protected from an event they would have otherwise had. This is where the NNT of $20$ comes from, as we need to treat $20$ people to prevent $1$ event.\"\n\n$2$. **Beneficence and Nonmaleficence**: The principles of acting in the patient's best interest (beneficence) and avoiding harm (nonmaleficence) require a balanced presentation of both the potential benefits and the potential harms. The NNH must be communicated with the same clarity as the NNT. The communication would continue: \"At the same time, the therapy has risks. The main risk is major bleeding. Without the therapy, we expect about $1$ person out of $100$ to have a major bleed over a year. With the therapy, this number increases to about $3$ out of $100$. This means that for every $100$ people who take the therapy, there are $2$ additional cases of major bleeding that would not have happened otherwise. This is where the NNH of $50$ comes from, as we would need to treat $50$ people for one of them to experience this harm.\"\n\n$3$. **Shared Decision-Making and Trade-Offs**: The core of the ethical communication is to frame the choice as a trade-off. The patient must weigh the benefit against the harm. The physician can facilitate this by juxtaposing the communicated numbers: \"So, the choice we are looking at involves this trade-off. For every year of treatment, we prevent a cardiovascular event for every $20$ people we treat, and we cause a major bleeding event for every $50$ people we treat.\" This presents the likelihood of benefit versus the likelihood of harm. The ratio of NNH to NNT, which is $50/20 = 2.5$, indicates that for every $1$ major bleed caused by the therapy, approximately $2.5$ cardiovascular events are prevented. Presenting the information this way allows the patient to apply their own values. A patient who is extremely fearful of a stroke might find this trade-off acceptable, while a patient who has a high aversion to bleeding or its consequences might not. The goal is not to persuade the patient but to equip them to make an informed choice that is right for them. This collaborative process is the essence of shared decision-making.\n\nBy presenting absolute risks in a frequentist format and explicitly framing the decision as a trade-off between the quantified NNT and NNH, the physician upholds the ethical pillars of autonomy, beneficence, and nonmaleficence, ensuring the informed consent process is robust and patient-centered.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n20 & 50\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4868934"}, {"introduction": "The principle of justice demands that the benefits and burdens of healthcare are distributed equitably, a challenge that is amplified in the age of artificial intelligence.

The values provided are plausible. For instance, the specificity of $0.75$ in the majority population implies a false positive rate of $FPR_{\\text{majority}} = 1 - Sp_{\\text{majority}} = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$. The false positive rate in the minority population is then $FPR_{\\text{minority}} = 1.20 \\times 0.25 = 0.30$, which implies a specificity of $Sp_{\\text{minority}} = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$. All performance metrics are within the valid range of $[0, 1]$. The problem is well-posed and objective. A minor ambiguity exists as the sensitivity for the minority population ($Se_{\\text{minority}}$) is not explicitly stated. However, the problem states the model exhibits \"a systematic increase in the false positive rate,\" implying this is the specific bias under consideration. The most logical and standard interpretation is that other performance parameters are unchanged. Therefore, it is a reasonable and necessary assumption that $Se_{\\text{minority}} = Se_{\\text{majority}}$. The problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Part 1: Quantitative Analysis**\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has the disease, and let $T$ be the event that the AI tool returns a positive test. The prevalence is $P(D) = p$.\n\nThe definitions of sensitivity ($Se$) and specificity ($Sp$) are:\n$$Se = P(T|D)$$\n$$Sp = P(T^c|D^c)$$\nwhere $T^c$ is a negative test and $D^c$ is the absence of disease.\n\nThe false positive rate ($FPR$) is:\n$$FPR = P(T|D^c) = 1 - Sp$$\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is the probability that a patient has the disease given a positive test result, $PPV = P(D|T)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, is the total probability of a positive test, found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the standard definitions, with $P(D) = p$ and $P(D^c) = 1-p$:\n$$P(T) = Se \\cdot p + FPR \\cdot (1-p) = Se \\cdot p + (1-Sp) \\cdot (1-p)$$\n\nTherefore, the general expression for PPV is:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1-Sp)(1-p)}$$\n\nNow, we apply this formula to each population.\n\n**Majority Population:**\nWe are given $p = 0.10$, $Se_{\\text{majority}} = 0.85$, and $Sp_{\\text{majority}} = 0.75$.\nThe numerator is $Se_{\\text{majority}} \\cdot p = 0.85 \\times 0.10 = 0.085$.\nThe false positive rate is $FPR_{\\text{majority}} = 1 - Sp_{\\text{majority}} = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$.\nThe denominator is $Se_{\\text{majority}} \\cdot p + FPR_{\\text{majority}} \\cdot (1-p) = (0.85 \\times 0.10) + (0.25 \\times (1-0.10)) = 0.085 + (0.25 \\times 0.90) = 0.085 + 0.225 = 0.310$.\nSo, the PPV for the majority population is:\n$$\\mathrm{PPV}_{\\text{majority}} = \\frac{0.085}{0.310} \\approx 0.2741935...$$\n\n**Minority Population:**\nWe assume sensitivity is unchanged, so $Se_{\\text{minority}} = 0.85$. The prevalence is also unchanged, $p=0.10$.\nThe false positive rate is specified as $FPR_{\\text{minority}} = 1.20 \\times FPR_{\\text{majority}} = 1.20 \\times 0.25 = 0.30$.\nThis implies a specificity of $Sp_{\\text{minority}} = 1 - FPR_{\\text{minority}} = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\nThe numerator is $Se_{\\text{minority}} \\cdot p = 0.85 \\times 0.10 = 0.085$.\nThe denominator is $Se_{\\text{minority}} \\cdot p + FPR_{\\text{minority}} \\cdot (1-p) = (0.85 \\times 0.10) + (0.30 \\times (1-0.10)) = 0.085 + (0.30 \\times 0.90) = 0.085 + 0.270 = 0.355$.\nSo, the PPV for the minority population is:\n$$\\mathrm{PPV}_{\\text{minority}} = \\frac{0.085}{0.355} \\approx 0.2394366...$$\n\n**Difference in PPV:**\nThe difference, $\\Delta \\mathrm{PPV}$, is calculated as:\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{PPV} = \\mathrm{PPV}_{\\text{majority}} - \\mathrm{PPV}_{\\text{minority}}$$\n$$\\Delta \\mathrm{PPV} \\approx 0.2741935 - 0.2394366 = 0.0347569...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.03476$.\n\n**Part 2: Ethical Analysis and Mitigation**\n\nThe calculated difference, $\\Delta \\mathrm{PPV} = 0.03476 > 0$, signifies that a positive flag from the AI tool is more likely to be a true positive for a patient in the majority population than for a patient in the minority population. Conversely, a positive flag for a minority patient is more likely to be a false positive. This disparity has significant ethical implications for clinical decision-making.\n\nJustification via Core Ethical Principles:\n1.  **Nonmaleficence (Do no harm):** The higher false positive rate ($FPR_{\\text{minority}} = 0.30$ vs. $FPR_{\\text{majority}} = 0.25$) subjects the minority population to a greater risk of iatrogenic harm. A false positive flag can trigger a cascade of unnecessary, expensive, and potentially invasive follow-up procedures (e.g., biopsies, CT scans with contrast). These procedures carry their own risks, in addition to causing significant psychological distress (anxiety, fear) and financial burden. The AI tool, in its current state, systematically exposes one group to a higher probability of this harm.\n2.  **Justice (Fairness):** This scenario represents a clear violation of distributive justice. The benefits of the AI tool (accurate detection) and its burdens (risk of a false positive) are inequitably distributed. The minority group bears a disproportionate share of the burdens, which can create or exacerbate health disparities. It fails to treat all populations with equal concern and respect, undermining the goal of equitable healthcare.\n3.  **Beneficence (Act in the patient's best interest):** A diagnostic tool is beneficial if it provides accurate information to guide clinical care. For the minority population, the informational value of a positive test is degraded (lower PPV). A clinician acting on this less reliable information may not be acting in the patient's best interest. The tool is less beneficent for this group.\n4.  **Respect for Persons (Autonomy and Informed Consent):** True informed consent requires that the patient receives accurate information about risks, benefits, and alternatives. If a clinician is unaware of this performance difference, they cannot adequately inform a minority patient about the true (lower) probability of disease given a positive test. For example, they might quote a general PPV of $\\approx 27\\%$ when the patient's actual probability is closer to $\\approx 24\\%$. This compromises the patient's autonomy to make a decision based on their actual risk profile. Over time, the discovery of such systemic biases can erode trust in both the technology and the healthcare system.\n\nMitigation Strategies:\nTwo concrete, ethically-justified mitigation strategies that address the increased false positive rate without worsening false negatives (i.e., without decreasing sensitivity) are:\n\n1.  **Population-Specific Thresholding:** Many AI models produce a continuous risk score, and a threshold is applied to this score to generate a binary flag. The disparity in FPR suggests that a single, universal threshold is inequitable. A first mitigation strategy is to establish and deploy different decision thresholds for the majority and minority populations. For the minority group, a higher threshold could be selected, specifically calibrated to reduce the false positive rate to match that of the majority group ($FPR = 0.25$). This must be done carefully to ensure the sensitivity for the minority group does not decrease. **Ethical Justification:** This strategy directly targets the inequitable distribution of burdens, in line with the principle of Justice. It aims to equalize the risk of error for all patients, ensuring that the burden of a false positive is not disproportionately borne by one group. This promotes a fairer standard of care.\n\n2.  **Data Augmentation and Model Retraining:** The underlying cause of performance disparity is often a lack of diverse, representative data used to train the model. The model may not have learned the specific features or data distributions relevant to the minority population. A more fundamental, long-term strategy is to collect additional, high-quality labeled data from the minority population and retrain the model. If data collection is difficult, techniques like targeted data augmentation or transfer learning can be used to improve the model's performance on the underrepresented group. **Ethical Justification:** This strategy addresses the root cause of the bias, upholding the principles of both Justice and Beneficence. By investing resources in creating an AI tool that is inherently accurate and fair across all populations, it provides a greater benefit to all patients and remedies a systemic inequity. It demonstrates respect for the minority population by actively working to ensure the technology serves them as effectively and safely as it serves the majority population.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.03476}\n$$", "id": "4868892"}]}
