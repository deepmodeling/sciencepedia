This practice explores how to quantitatively update your assessment of disease probability using test results.

For a patient with a pretest probability of PE of $0.2$ (derived from a validated clinical decision rule), a qualitative D-dimer assay is considered as the initial test. The assay’s operating characteristics in this population are a sensitivity of $0.95$ and a specificity of $0.45$. Using only the foundational definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and Bayes’ theorem, compute the post-test probability of PE after a negative D-dimer result.

Let $D$ denote the event “patient has Pulmonary Embolism (PE)” and $\\neg D$ denote “patient does not have PE.” Let “neg” denote a negative D-dimer test result.

This exercise applies principles from reliability engineering to a critical workflow: medication reconciliation. You will model a multi-step process as a series system, calculate its baseline reliability, and then determine how to strategically add redundancy to achieve a high-reliability target, demonstrating how system redesign is a powerful tool for error prevention. [@problem_id:4882098]", "problem": "A tertiary care internal medicine service seeks to improve the reliability of its medication reconciliation workflow at hospital admission to reduce adverse drug events. The workflow consists of two sequential steps that must both succeed to achieve a correct and complete home medication list: Step A (initial medication history acquisition by the admitting clinician) and Step B (pharmacist reconciliation in the Electronic Health Record (EHR)). Historical audit data suggest that, under current conditions, Step A succeeds with probability $0.9$ and Step B succeeds with probability $0.95$. Assume that, under current conditions, the success of Step A and Step B are independent events, and that the workflow fails if either step fails.\n\nUsing only the fundamental definitions of probability, independence, and reliability for series systems, derive the baseline overall workflow reliability. Then, propose and model a scientifically realistic design change to achieve overall reliability greater than $0.99$ by adding redundancy to the process as follows: implement $n$ independent parallel verification attempts for Step A (e.g., additional standardized clinician cross-checks using a structured checklist, each attempt identical in performance to the current Step A), and add exactly one additional independent parallel reconciliation for Step B (e.g., a second pharmacist reconciliation using the same standardized procedure, identical in performance to the current Step B). Under this redesign, the workflow proceeds to completion if at least one of the parallel attempts in Step A succeeds and at least one of the two parallel attempts in Step B succeeds, and the redesigned Step A and Step B are independent of each other.\n\nStarting from first principles, derive an analytic expression for the redesigned overall reliability as a function of $n$, and determine the smallest integer $n$ that ensures the redesigned overall reliability is strictly greater than $0.99$.

Derivation of an analytical expression for the redesigned workflow reliability as a function of $n$.\n3. Determination of the smallest integer $n$ to meet a specified reliability target.\n\nLet $S_A$ be the event that Step A succeeds and $S_B$ be the event that Step B succeeds. The probabilities of success for the original, single-attempt steps are given as:\n$P(S_A) = 0.9$\n$P(S_B) = 0.95$\n\nThe corresponding probabilities of failure are:\n$P(F_A) = 1 - P(S_A) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1$\n$P(F_B) = 1 - P(S_B) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$\n\n**Part 1: Baseline Workflow Reliability**\nThe original workflow is described as a series system, meaning it succeeds only if both Step A and Step B succeed. The overall baseline reliability, $R_{baseline}$, is the probability of the intersection of these two events, $P(S_A \\cap S_B)$. As the problem states that the success of Step A and Step B are independent events, the baseline reliability is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$R_{baseline} = P(S_A \\cap S_B) = P(S_A) \\times P(S_B)$$\n$$R_{baseline} = 0.9 \\times 0.95 = 0.855$$\n\n**Part 2: Redesigned Workflow Reliability**\nThe redesigned workflow remains a series system composed of a redesigned Step A (let's call it A') and a redesigned Step B (let's call it B'). The overall reliability of the new system, $R_{new}$, is the product of the reliabilities of these new, independent components, $R_{A'}$ and $R_{B'}$.\n$$R_{new} = R_{A'} \\times R_{B'}$$\n\nFirst, we derive the reliability of the redesigned Step A', $R_{A'}$. Step A' consists of $n$ independent, parallel attempts. Each attempt has a probability of success of $P(S_A) = 0.9$ and a probability of failure of $P(F_A) = 0.1$. The redesigned Step A' is considered successful if at least one of the $n$ attempts succeeds. It is more direct to calculate the probability of the complementary event: the failure of Step A'. Step A' fails only if all $n$ parallel attempts fail. Since the attempts are independent, the probability of this compound failure, $P(F_{A'})$, is:\n$$P(F_{A'}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(F_A) = (P(F_A))^{n} = (0.1)^{n}$$\nThe reliability of Step A', $R_{A'}$, is the probability of its success, which is $1$ minus the probability of its failure:\n$$R_{A'} = 1 - P(F_{A'}) = 1 - (0.1)^{n}$$\n\nNext, we derive the reliability of the redesigned Step B', $R_{B'}$. Step B' consists of exactly two independent, parallel attempts. Each attempt has a probability of success of $P(S_B) = 0.95$ and a probability of failure of $P(F_B) = 0.05$. Similar to Step A', Step B' fails only if both attempts fail. The probability of failure for Step B', $P(F_{B'})$, is:\n$$P(F_{B'}) = P(F_B) \\times P(F_B) = (P(F_B))^{2} = (0.05)^{2} = 0.0025$$\nThe reliability of Step B', $R_{B'}$, is:\n$$R_{B'} = 1 - P(F_{B'}) = 1 - (0.05)^{2} = 1 - 0.0025 = 0.9975$$\n\nNow, we can write the analytical expression for the overall redesigned reliability, $R_{new}$, as a function of $n$:\n$$R_{new}(n) = R_{A'} \\times R_{B'} = \\left(1 - (0.1)^{n}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - (0.05)^{2}\\right)$$\n$$R_{new}(n) = \\left(1 - (0.1)^{n}\\right) \\times 0.9975$$\n\n**Part 3: Determine the Smallest Integer $n$**\nThe final task is to find the smallest integer $n$ for which the overall redesigned reliability is strictly greater than $0.99$. We must solve the inequality:\n$$R_{new}(n) > 0.99$$\n$$\\left(1 - (0.1)^{n}\\right) \\times 0.9975 > 0.99$$\nWe proceed to solve for $n$:\n$$1 - (0.1)^{n} > \\frac{0.99}{0.9975}$$\nSubtracting $1$ from both sides and multiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality sign:\n$$(0.1)^{n} < 1 - \\frac{0.99}{0.9975}$$\n$$(0.1)^{n} < \\frac{0.9975 - 0.99}{0.9975}$$\n$$(0.1)^{n} < \\frac{0.0075}{0.9975}$$\nThis fraction can be simplified:\n$$\\frac{0.0075}{0.9975} = \\frac{75}{9975} = \\frac{3 \\times 25}{399 \\times 25} = \\frac{3}{399} = \\frac{1}{133}$$\nSo the inequality becomes:\n$$(0.1)^{n} < \\frac{1}{133}$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)^{n} < \\frac{1}{133}$$\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides reverses the inequality sign again:\n$$10^{n} > 133$$\nWe need to find the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies this condition. We can test integer values of $n$:\nFor $n=1$, $10^{1} = 10$, which is not greater than $133$.\nFor $n=2$, $10^{2} = 100$, which is not greater than $133$.\nFor $n=3$, $10^{3} = 1000$, which is greater than $133$.\n\nThus, the smallest integer value of $n$ that ensures the redesigned overall reliability is strictly greater than $0.99$ is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "4882098"}, {"introduction": "Once a quality improvement initiative is in place, we must monitor its performance over time to ensure stability and detect changes.
