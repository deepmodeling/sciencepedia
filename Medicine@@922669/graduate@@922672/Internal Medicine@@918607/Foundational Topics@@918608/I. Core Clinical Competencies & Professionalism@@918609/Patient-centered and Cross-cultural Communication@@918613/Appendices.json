You will quantify the trade-offs in a way that can be communicated back to the patient.\n\nAssume a fixed decision horizon of $T=5$ years and the following scientifically plausible parameters for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and treatment experience:\n\n- Baseline $5$-year probability of at least one MACE if the patient receives no therapy is $p_{0}=0.25$.\n- The quality-adjusted life year (QALY) loss associated with experiencing a MACE over the $5$-year horizon is $L=1.2$ QALYs.\n- Under full adherence, the intensive plan reduces the MACE probability by a relative risk factor $r_{I}=0.60$, and the minimal plan reduces the MACE probability by a relative risk factor $r_{M}=0.85$.\n- The annual disutility from treatment side effects is $d_{I}=0.02$ QALY per year under the intensive plan and $d_{M}=0.005$ QALY per year under the minimal plan.\n- Because of cultural beliefs and language barriers, the adherence probability to the intensive plan is $a_{I}=0.55$, while adherence to the minimal plan is $a_{M}=0.85$.

The scenario is a standard application of decision analysis in a clinical context, using established concepts such as Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), relative risk, adherence, and expected value. The parameters provided are defined as plausible and are internally consistent. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a formal solution can be constructed.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the expected net benefit in QALYs for two treatment plans, an intensive plan ($I$) and a minimal plan ($M$), and then to compute the difference between them, $NB_{I} - NB_{M}$. The decision horizon is $T=5$ years.\n\nThe net benefit ($NB$) for any given plan is defined as the expected avoided event-related QALY loss minus the expected treatment-related QALY loss.\n$$NB = (\\text{Expected avoided QALY loss from MACE}) - (\\text{Expected QALY loss from treatment})$$\n\nLet us formalize these two components for a generic treatment plan, denoted by subscript $k$. The provided parameters are:\n- Baseline $5$-year probability of a Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event (MACE): $p_{0} = 0.25$\n- QALY loss associated with a MACE: $L = 1.2$ QALYs\n- Relative risk factor for plan $k$: $r_k$\n- Annual disutility from side effects for plan $k$: $d_k$\n- Adherence probability for plan $k$: $a_k$\n- Decision horizon: $T = 5$ years\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the expected avoided QALY loss from MACE. The QALY loss from MACE under a baseline \"no therapy\" scenario is the probability of the event multiplied by the loss associated with it: $p_{0}L$.\n\nFor a treatment plan $k$, the outcome is contingent on adherence.\n- With probability $a_k$, the patient is adherent. The MACE probability is reduced by the relative risk factor $r_k$, becoming $p_{0}r_k$. The QALY loss from MACE in this case is $p_{0}r_k L$.\n- With probability $(1 - a_k)$, the patient is nonadherent. Per the problem statement, no therapeutic risk reduction occurs, so the MACE probability remains at baseline, $p_{0}$. The QALY loss from MACE is $p_{0}L$.\n\nThe overall expected QALY loss from MACE for plan $k$, $E[\\text{Loss}_{\\text{MACE}, k}]$, is the weighted average of these two outcomes:\n$$E[\\text{Loss}_{\\text{MACE}, k}] = a_k (p_{0}r_k L) + (1 - a_k) (p_{0}L)$$\nThe expected *avoided* QALY loss is the difference between the baseline loss and the expected loss with the plan:\n$$\\text{Expected avoided QALY loss} = p_{0}L - E[\\text{Loss}_{\\text{MACE}, k}]$$\n$$\\text{Expected avoided QALY loss} = p_{0}L - [a_k p_{0}r_k L + (1 - a_k) p_{0}L]$$\nFactoring out $p_{0}L$:\n$$\\text{Expected avoided QALY loss} = p_{0}L (1 - [a_k r_k + 1 - a_k])$$\n$$\\text{Expected avoided QALY loss} = p_{0}L (1 - a_k r_k - 1 + a_k)$$\n$$\\text{Expected avoided QALY loss} = p_{0}L a_k (1 - r_k)$$\nThis expression correctly shows that the benefit (avoided loss) is realized only in proportion to the adherence probability $a_k$.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the expected QALY loss from treatment side effects. The annual disutility from side effects for plan $k$ is $d_k$. Over the horizon of $T$ years, the total disutility is $d_k T$. This disutility is only experienced if the patient is adherent.\n- With probability $a_k$, the patient is adherent and experiences the total disutility of $d_k T$.\n- With probability $(1 - a_k)$, the patient is nonadherent and experiences no disutility, which is a loss of $0$.\n\nThe expected QALY loss from treatment, $E[\\text{Loss}_{\\text{Treat}, k}]$, is the weighted average:\n$$E[\\text{Loss}_{\\text{Treat}, k}] = a_k (d_k T) + (1 - a_k) (0) = a_k d_k T$$\n\nNow we combine these components to find the net benefit for plan $k$, $NB_k$:\n$$NB_k = p_{0}L a_k (1 - r_k) - a_k d_k T$$\nWe can factor out the adherence probability $a_k$:\n$$NB_k = a_k [p_{0}L(1 - r_k) - d_k T]$$\n\nWe now apply this general formula to the intensive ($I$) and minimal ($M$) plans using the specific parameters provided.\n\nFor the intensive plan ($I$):\n$a_{I} = 0.55$, $r_{I} = 0.60$, $d_{I} = 0.02$ QALY/year.\n$$NB_I = a_I [p_{0}L(1 - r_I) - d_I T]$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$NB_I = 0.55 \\times [(0.25 \\times 1.2 \\times (1 - 0.60)) - (0.02 \\times 5)]$$\n$$NB_I = 0.55 \\times [(0.3 \\times 0.40) - 0.1]$$\n$$NB_I = 0.55 \\times [0.12 - 0.1]$$\n$$NB_I = 0.55 \\times 0.02 = 0.011 \\text{ QALYs}$$\n\nFor the minimal plan ($M$):\n$a_{M} = 0.85$, $r_{M} = 0.85$, $d_{M} = 0.005$ QALY/year.\n$$NB_M = a_M [p_{0}L(1 - r_M) - d_M T]$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$NB_M = 0.85 \\times [(0.25 \\times 1.2 \\times (1 - 0.85)) - (0.005 \\times 5)]$$\n$$NB_M = 0.85 \\times [(0.3 \\times 0.15) - 0.025]$$\n$$NB_M = 0.85 \\times [0.045 - 0.025]$$\n$$NB_M = 0.85 \\times 0.02 = 0.017 \\text{ QALYs}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the difference in net benefit between the intensive and minimal plans, $NB_{I} - NB_{M}$:\n$$\\Delta NB = NB_I - NB_M = 0.011 - 0.017$$\n$$\\Delta NB = -0.006$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
