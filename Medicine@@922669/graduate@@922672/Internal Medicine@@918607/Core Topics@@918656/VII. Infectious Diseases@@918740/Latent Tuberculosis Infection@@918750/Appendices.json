The provided numerical values are plausible for a tuberculin skin test in a high-risk population. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to compute a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution will be derived from first principles of probability, as requested. Let us define the following events:\n- $D$: The event that an individual has LTBI (the \"disease\" is present).\n- $D^c$: The event that an individual does not have LTBI.\n- $T$: The event that the tuberculin skin test (TST) is positive.\n- $T^c$: The event that the TST is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we can translate the given information into probabilistic terms:\n1.  The prevalence of LTBI is the prior probability of having the disease:\n    $$P(D) = 0.20$$\n    From this, the probability of not having the disease is:\n    $$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$$\n\n2.  Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test given that the individual has the disease:\n    $$P(T|D) = 0.80$$\n\n3.  Specificity is the probability of a negative test given that the individual does not have the disease:\n    $$P(T^c|D^c) = 0.95$$\n    The probability of a positive test in an individual without the disease (the false positive rate) is the complement of the specificity:\n    $$P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nThe objective is to compute the positive predictive value (PPV), which is defined as the probability that an individual has LTBI given a positive TST. In our notation, this is the conditional probability $P(D|T)$.\n\nUsing the fundamental definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(T)}$$\nwhere $P(D \\cap T)$ is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive, and $P(T)$ is the overall probability of testing positive.\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, $P(D \\cap T)$. We can rearrange the definition of conditional probability for $P(T|D)$:\n$$P(T|D) = \\frac{P(T \\cap D)}{P(D)} \\implies P(D \\cap T) = P(T|D)P(D)$$\nThis term represents the probability of a true positive result in the population. Substituting the given values:\n$$P(D \\cap T) = 0.80 \\times 0.20 = 0.16$$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, $P(T)$, using the Law of Total Probability. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: an individual has the disease and tests positive ($D \\cap T$), or an individual does not have the disease and tests positive ($D^c \\cap T$). Therefore:\n$$P(T) = P(D \\cap T) + P(D^c \\cap T)$$\nWe already have $P(D \\cap T) = 0.16$. We now compute $P(D^c \\cap T)$ in a similar manner:\n$$P(T|D^c) = \\frac{P(T \\cap D^c)}{P(D^c)} \\implies P(D^c \\cap T) = P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nThis term represents the probability of a false positive result in the population. Substituting the values:\n$$P(D^c \\cap T) = 0.05 \\times 0.80 = 0.04$$\nNow, we can find the total probability of a positive test:\n$$P(T) = 0.16 + 0.04 = 0.20$$\n\nFinally, we can compute the positive predictive value, $P(D|T)$:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(T)} = \\frac{0.16}{0.20}$$\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{16}{20} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures. The exact value is $0.8$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $0.8000$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8000}$$", "id": "4862192"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis of LTBI is established, the decision to initiate preventive therapy involves weighing the benefits against potential harms.

This means the risk in the treated group, $R_T$, is related to the risk in the untreated group, $R_U$, by the factor $(1 - r)$.\n- Definition (iii): Absolute risk reduction, $ARR$, is the difference between untreated and treated risks: $ARR = R_U - R_T$.\n- Definition (iv): The number needed to treat, $NNT$, is the number of individuals who must be treated to avert one outcome event.\n- Final instruction: Report the $NNT$ as a single integer, rounding any non-integer result to the next highest integer (i.e., applying the ceiling function).\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is a standard epidemiological calculation based on established and well-defined metrics ($R_U$, $R_T$, $RRR$, $ARR$, $NNT$). The values provided for the risk ($0.02$) and risk reduction ($0.70$) are plausible in the context of latent tuberculosis. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary definitions and data provided. The language is precise and objective. The simplifying assumption of no competing risks is explicitly stated, which is a common and valid approach for creating a tractable problem in this domain. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation\nThe solution proceeds by applying the provided definitions sequentially.\n\nLet $R_U$ be the absolute risk in the untreated cohort over the $5$-year horizon. From the problem statement, we have:\n$$R_U = 0.02$$\n\nLet $R_T$ be the absolute risk in the treated cohort over the same horizon. The problem states that the treatment reduces the risk of progression by a relative proportion of $0.70$. This is the relative risk reduction, $RRR$.\n$$RRR = 0.70$$\n\nUsing the definition of relative risk reduction, which can be expressed as $RRR = \\frac{R_U - R_T}{R_U}$, we can solve for $R_T$. Rearranging this equation gives:\n$$R_U - R_T = R_U \\times RRR$$\n$$R_T = R_U - R_U \\times RRR$$\n$$R_T = R_U (1 - RRR)$$\nThis is consistent with the provided definition (ii) of multiplicative risk reduction.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_T = 0.02 \\times (1 - 0.70) = 0.02 \\times 0.30 = 0.006$$\nSo, the absolute risk of progression in the treated group is $0.006$.\n\nNext, we calculate the absolute risk reduction, $ARR$, which is defined as the difference between the risk in the untreated group and the risk in the treated group.\n$$ARR = R_U - R_T$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ARR = 0.02 - 0.006 = 0.014$$\nThis value, $0.014$, represents the proportion of individuals in the treated group for whom one case of active tuberculosis is averted.\n\nFinally, we calculate the number needed to treat, $NNT$. The $NNT$ is defined as the number of individuals who must be treated over the horizon to avert one outcome event. Mathematically, this is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nSubstituting the calculated value of $ARR$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.014}$$\nTo compute the value, we can express the denominator as a fraction:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{\\frac{14}{1000}} = \\frac{1000}{14} = \\frac{500}{7}$$\nNow, we convert this fraction to a decimal to apply the rounding rule:\n$$\\frac{500}{7} \\approx 71.42857$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be reported as the next highest integer. This corresponds to applying the ceiling function to the result.\n$$NNT_{final} = \\lceil \\frac{500}{7} \\rceil = \\lceil 71.42857... \\rceil = 72$$\nTherefore, $72$ individuals must be treated over the $5$-year period to prevent one case of active tuberculosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{72}$$", "id": "4862206"}, {"introduction": "Managing patients on LTBI therapy requires vigilant monitoring for adverse effects, most notably drug-induced hepatotoxicity.

This can be written as a mathematical inequality:\n$$A  5 \\times U$$\n\nThe problem defines a dimensionless ratio, $m$, as the patient's current measured ALT divided by the upper limit of normal:\n$$m = \\frac{A}{U}$$\n\nTo construct the decision rule in terms of $m$, we start with the primary inequality, $A  5U$. Since the upper limit of normal, $U$, is a concentration and must be a positive value ($U  0$), we can divide both sides of the inequality by $U$ without changing the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$\\frac{A}{U}  \\frac{5U}{U}$$\n\nSimplifying the right side of the inequality gives:\n$$\\frac{A}{U}  5$$\n\nBy substituting the definition of $m = \\frac{A}{U}$ into this inequality, we arrive at the decision rule expressed in terms of the dimensionless ratio $m$:\n$$m  5$$\n\nThis inequality, $m  5$, is the formal decision rule for an asymptomatic patient. It dictates that therapy should be held if the patient's measured ALT, expressed as a multiple of the upper limit of normal, is greater than $5$. This dimensionless formulation is clinically useful because it standardizes the criterion across different laboratories that may have slightly different reference ranges for the ULN.\n\nNext, we must compute the value of $m$ for the given patient data. The problem provides:\n-   The patient's current measured ALT: $A = 220 \\, \\text{U/L}$.\n-   The laboratory's upper limit of normal: $U = 40 \\, \\text{U/L}$.\n\nUsing the definition of $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{A}{U} = \\frac{220}{40}$$\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$m = 5.5$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $m=5.5$ can be written as $5.500$ to express it with the required precision.\n\nAccording to the derived rule ($m5$), since the calculated value for this patient is $m=5.5$, and $5.5  5$, the condition to hold isoniazid therapy is met.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{5.500}\n$$", "id": "4862211"}]}
