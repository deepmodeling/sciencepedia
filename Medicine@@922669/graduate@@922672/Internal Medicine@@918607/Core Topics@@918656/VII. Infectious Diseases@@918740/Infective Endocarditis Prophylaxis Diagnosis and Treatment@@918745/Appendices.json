The scenario is a standard application of Bayesian inference in medical diagnostics. Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the final post-test probability of Infective Endocarditis (IE) after two sequential negative tests. We are instructed to start from first principles, specifically the relationship between probability and odds, and the odds form of Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has Infective Endocarditis, and $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have IE.\nThe probability of an event $A$ is denoted by $P(A)$. The odds in favor of event $A$ are given by the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring:\n$$O(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{1 - P(A)} = \\frac{P(A)}{P(A^c)}$$\nConversely, the probability of an event can be recovered from its odds:\n$$P(A) = \\frac{O(A)}{1 + O(A)}$$\n\nBayes' theorem can be expressed in terms of odds. For a given test result $E$, the relationship between the prior (pre-test) odds and the posterior (post-test) odds is:\n$$O(D|E) = O(D) \\times LR(E)$$\nwhere $O(D)$ are the prior odds of disease, $O(D|E)$ are the posterior odds of disease given evidence $E$, and $LR(E)$ is the likelihood ratio for the evidence $E$.\n\nIn this problem, the evidence consists of negative test results. The likelihood ratio for a negative test result is the negative likelihood ratio, $LR^{-}$. It is defined as the ratio of the probability of a negative test result in patients with the disease to the probability of a negative test result in patients without the disease:\n$$LR^{-} = \\frac{P(\\text{Test Negative} | D)}{P(\\text{Test Negative} | D^c)}$$\nThe problem involves two sequential tests: a Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) and a Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE). Let $T_1^{-}$ be the event of a negative TTE result, and $T_2^{-}$ be the event of a negative TEE result.\n\nThe given information is:\nInitial pre-test probability of IE: $P_{\\text{pre}} = P(D) = 0.25$.\nNegative likelihood ratio for TTE: $LR^{-}_{\\text{TTE}} = 0.3$.\nNegative likelihood ratio for TEE: $LR^{-}_{\\text{TEE}} = 0.1$.\n\nThe process is as follows:\n1.  Calculate the initial pre-test odds of IE.\n2.  Update the odds using the result of the first test (negative TTE) to find the intermediate post-test odds.\n3.  Use these intermediate odds as the pre-test odds for the second test and update them using the result of the second test (negative TEE) to find the final post-test odds.\n4.  Convert the final post-test odds back to a probability.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the initial pre-test odds ($O_{\\text{pre}}$).\n$$O_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{pre}}}{1 - P_{\\text{pre}}} = \\frac{0.25}{1 - 0.25} = \\frac{0.25}{0.75} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nStep 2: Calculate the post-TTE odds ($O_{\\text{post-TTE}}$).\nThe pre-test odds are updated using the $LR^{-}$ for the TTE.\n$$O_{\\text{post-TTE}} = O_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR^{-}_{\\text{TTE}}$$\n$$O_{\\text{post-TTE}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 0.3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1$$\nThis is the new odds of IE after the negative TTE. This quantity represents the pre-test odds for the subsequent TEE test.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the final post-TEE odds ($O_{\\text{final}}$).\nThe odds after the TTE, $O_{\\text{post-TTE}}$, become the prior odds for the TEE test. We update these odds using the $LR^{-}$ for the TEE.\n$$O_{\\text{final}} = O_{\\text{post-TTE}} \\times LR^{-}_{\\text{TEE}}$$\n$$O_{\\text{final}} = 0.1 \\times 0.1 = 0.01$$\nThe assumption of conditional independence of the tests given the disease status allows for this sequential update. Equivalently, one could multiply the likelihood ratios first to get a combined $LR^{-} = LR^{-}_{\\text{TTE}} \\times LR^{-}_{\\text{TEE}} = 0.3 \\times 0.1 = 0.03$, and then apply it to the initial odds: $O_{\\text{final}} = O_{\\text{pre}} \\times (LR^{-}_{\\text{TTE}} \\times LR^{-}_{\\text{TEE}}) = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 0.03 = 0.01$. The result is the same.\n\nStep 4: Convert the final odds back to a probability ($P_{\\text{final}}$).\nUsing the formula to convert odds to probability:\n$$P_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{O_{\\text{final}}}{1 + O_{\\text{final}}}$$\n$$P_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{0.01}{1 + 0.01} = \\frac{0.01}{1.01} = \\frac{1}{101}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures.\n$$P_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{1}{101} \\approx 0.0099009900...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we look at the first four non-zero digits, $9900$, and the fifth digit, $9$.

Modern therapy has moved beyond one-size-fits-all dosing towards a more precise approach guided by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) principles.

Provide only the dose as your final numeric answer.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed objectively.\n\nThe solution is approached in two parts as requested: first, a justification of the pharmacodynamic target, and second, the calculation of the required dose.\n\nPart 1: Justification of the Pharmacodynamic Target\n\nVancomycin is an antibiotic whose bactericidal activity is dependent on maintaining a sufficient concentration over time. For such drugs, the total exposure over a dosing interval, rather than a single peak or trough concentration, is the most reliable predictor of efficacy. This total exposure is quantified by the area under the plasma concentration-time curve over a $24$-hour period at steady state, denoted $\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}$.\n\nThe clinical effectiveness of an antimicrobial agent is fundamentally linked to the susceptibility of the infecting pathogen. This susceptibility is measured by the minimum inhibitory concentration, or $\\mathrm{MIC}$, which is the lowest concentration of the drug that prevents visible growth of the microorganism. The pharmacodynamic index $\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}/\\mathrm{MIC}$ is therefore the most appropriate metric because it integrates the patient's pharmacokinetic exposure to the drug ($\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}$) with the specific pathogen's vulnerability to it ($\\mathrm{MIC}$).\n\nThe problem states that for serious methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) infections like infective endocarditis, clinical evidence supports a target $\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}/\\mathrm{MIC}$ range between $400$ and $600$. This range is established to balance two competing considerations: efficacy and toxicity. An $\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}/\\mathrm{MIC}$ ratio below $400$ is associated with a higher probability of microbiological and clinical failure. Conversely, as the $\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}$ increases, so does the risk of dose-dependent adverse effects, most notably nephrotoxicity, with risk increasing substantially for $\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}/\\mathrm{MIC}$ values exceeding $600$. The specified range is therefore a therapeutic window.\n\nFor the given patient with a life-threatening infection, selecting the midpoint of this therapeutic range, which corresponds to an $\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}/\\mathrm{MIC}$ target of $500$, constitutes a sound clinical strategy. This choice provides a buffer against pharmacokinetic variability and measurement inaccuracies, ensuring the ratio is unlikely to fall below the efficacy threshold of $400$. At the same time, it maintains a conservative distance from the toxicity threshold of $600$, thereby embodying a risk-balanced approach to treatment.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Total Daily Dose\n\nThe objective is to compute the total daily vancomycin dose, $D_{\\mathrm{daily}}$, required to achieve the target $\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}/\\mathrm{MIC} = 500$.\n\nFirst, we determine the target $\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}$. Given the MRSA isolate has an $\\mathrm{MIC} = 1 \\, \\mathrm{mg/L}$:\n$$ \\text{Target } \\mathrm{AUC}_{24} = 500 \\times \\mathrm{MIC} = 500 \\times 1 \\, \\mathrm{mg/L} = 500 \\, \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h/L} $$\n\nThe relationship between the daily dose, clearance ($\\mathrm{CL}$), and $\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}$ is given as $\\mathrm{AUC}_{24} = \\dfrac{D_{\\mathrm{daily}}}{\\mathrm{CL}}$. This can be rearranged to solve for the dose:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{daily}} = \\mathrm{AUC}_{24} \\times \\mathrm{CL} $$\n\nTo find $D_{\\mathrm{daily}}$, we must first calculate the patient's vancomycin clearance. The problem states that for a renally eliminated drug like vancomycin, clearance is approximated by the product of the unbound fraction in plasma ($f_u$) and the glomerular filtration rate ($\\mathrm{GFR}$): $\\mathrm{CL} \\approx f_{u} \\times \\mathrm{GFR}$.\n\nThe $\\mathrm{GFR}$ is estimated by the creatinine clearance ($\\mathrm{CrCl}$), calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation for males with the patient's data: age $= 62$ years, weight $= 85$ kg, and serum creatinine $S_{\\mathrm{Cr}} = 1.6$ mg/dL.\n$$ \\mathrm{CrCl} = \\dfrac{(140 - \\text{age}) \\times \\text{weight}}{72 \\times S_{\\mathrm{Cr}}} = \\dfrac{(140 - 62) \\, \\text{years} \\times 85 \\, \\text{kg}}{72 \\times 1.6 \\, \\text{mg/dL}} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{CrCl} = \\dfrac{78 \\times 85}{115.2} = \\dfrac{6630}{115.2} = 57.552083... \\, \\mathrm{mL/min} $$\n\nNext, we convert the $\\mathrm{CrCl}$ from units of $\\mathrm{mL/min}$ to $\\mathrm{L/h}$ to maintain consistency for the clearance calculation. Using the provided conversion factor of $0.06$:\n$$ \\mathrm{CrCl} \\, (\\mathrm{L/h}) = 57.552083... \\, \\mathrm{mL/min} \\times 0.06 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{L/h}}{\\mathrm{mL/min}} = 3.453125 \\, \\mathrm{L/h} $$\nWe use this value as our estimate for the patient's $\\mathrm{GFR}$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the vancomycin clearance, $\\mathrm{CL}$, using the given unbound fraction $f_{u} = 0.55$:\n$$ \\mathrm{CL} = f_{u} \\times \\mathrm{GFR} = 0.55 \\times 3.453125 \\, \\mathrm{L/h} = 1.89921875 \\, \\mathrm{L/h} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the total daily dose, $D_{\\mathrm{daily}}$, required to achieve the target $\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}$ of $500 \\, \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h/L}$:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{daily}} = \\mathrm{AUC}_{24} \\times \\mathrm{CL} = 500 \\, \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h/L} \\times 1.89921875 \\, \\mathrm{L/h} $$\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{daily}} = 949.609375 \\, \\mathrm{mg} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final dose to be rounded to three significant figures.
