There are no scientific or factual inaccuracies, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $T$ be the event that a patient has true active tuberculosis, and let $T^c$ be the event that the patient does not have the disease. Let $+$ denote the event of a positive test result. We are tasked with finding the post-test probability of disease given a positive result, which is the conditional probability $P(T|+)$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n-   The pre-test probability, or prevalence, of tuberculosis: $P(T) = 0.005$.\n-   The sensitivity of the test: $P(+|T) = 0.90$. This is the probability of a positive test given the patient has the disease.\n-   The specificity of the test: $P(-|T^c) = 0.98$, where $-$ denotes a negative test result. This is the probability of a negative test given the patient does not have the disease.\n\nThe probability of a patient not having the disease is the complement of the prevalence:\n$$P(T^c) = 1 - P(T) = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995$$\n\nTo find $P(T|+)$, we start with the fundamental definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(T|+) = \\frac{P(T \\cap +)}{P(+)}$$\nwhere $P(T \\cap +)$ is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive, and $P(+)$ is the total probability of testing positive.\n\nThe numerator, $P(T \\cap +)$, can be expressed using the definition of conditional probability for sensitivity, $P(+|T) = \\frac{P(T \\cap +)}{P(T)}$. Rearranging gives:\n$$P(T \\cap +) = P(+|T) P(T)$$\nThis term represents the probability of a true positive result in the tested population.\n\nThe denominator, $P(+)$, can be found using the law of total probability. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: either the patient has the disease and tests positive (a true positive), or the patient does not have the disease and tests positive (a false positive).\n$$P(+) = P(T \\cap +) + P(T^c \\cap +)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for both terms:\n$$P(+) = P(+|T) P(T) + P(+|T^c) P(T^c)$$\n\nWe need to determine $P(+|T^c)$, the false positive rate. This is the probability of a positive test given the patient does not have the disease. It is the complement of the specificity, $P(-|T^c)$, since for a patient without the disease, the test can only be positive or negative.\n$$P(+|T^c) = 1 - P(-|T^c) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$$\n\nNow we assemble the expression for $P(T|+)$ by substituting the expanded forms for the numerator and denominator. This yields Bayes' theorem, derived from first principles:\n$$P(T|+) = \\frac{P(+|T) P(T)}{P(+|T) P(T) + P(+|T^c) P(T^c)}$$\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n-   $P(T) = 0.005$\n-   $P(T^c) = 0.995$\n-   $P(+|T) = 0.90$\n-   $P(+|T^c) = 0.02$\n\n$$P(T|+) = \\frac{(0.90)(0.005)}{(0.90)(0.005) + (0.02)(0.995)}$$\n\nFirst, calculate the value of the numerator (the probability of a true positive):\n$$\\text{Numerator} = 0.90 \\times 0.005 = 0.0045$$\n\nNext, calculate the two terms in the denominator:\n-   The probability of a true positive: $(0.90)(0.005) = 0.0045$\n-   The probability of a false positive: $(0.02)(0.995) = 0.0199$\n\nThe total probability of a positive test is the sum of these two probabilities:\n$$\\text{Denominator} = 0.0045 + 0.0199 = 0.0244$$\n\nFinally, we compute the post-test probability:\n$$P(T|+) = \\frac{0.0045}{0.0244} \\approx 0.1844262295$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $8$, $4$, and $4$. The fifth significant figure is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the fourth significant figure).\n\nTherefore, the post-test probability is $0.1844$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1844}\n$$", "id": "4785503"}, {"introduction": "Effective management of active tuberculosis extends far beyond prescribing medication; it requires a coordinated, multi-faceted approach from the moment a patient presents.

The correctness of the management plan is verifiable against established, evidence-based medical guidelines.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. I will now proceed with a detailed solution and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe patient presents with a high pre-test probability for active, infectious pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). The management plan must be comprehensive, addressing personal and public health needs simultaneously and aligning with established guidelines.\n\n**1. Isolation:** The patient has a cough and a cavitary lesion on chest radiography. Cavitary disease is associated with a high bacillary load and increased transmissibility. *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* is transmitted via airborne droplet nuclei. Therefore, the patient must be immediately placed under **airborne precautions** in an **Airborne Infection Isolation (AII) room**, which is maintained under negative pressure relative to surrounding areas.\n\n**2. Diagnostics:**\n- **Sputum Collection:** The standard is to collect $3$ sputum specimens, each $8$ to $24$ hours apart, with at least one being an early morning specimen to maximize yield.\n- **Sputum Analysis:** Each specimen should be sent for:\n    - **Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB) Smear Microscopy:** A rapid test to assess bacillary load and infectivity.\n    - **Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT):** A rapid molecular test (e.g., Xpert MTB/RIF) for detecting *M. tuberculosis* complex DNA and, crucially, mutations conferring rifampin resistance. At least one specimen should undergo NAAT.\n    - **Mycobacterial Culture:** The gold standard for diagnosis. It has the highest sensitivity, confirms the species, and is required for phenotypic **Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST)** for a full panel of anti-tuberculosis drugs.\n\n**3. Empiric Regimen Selection:** For a new patient with no prior treatment history, the standard empiric regimen for active TB is a four-drug combination, often abbreviated as **RIPE**:\n- **R**ifampin (RIF)\n- **I**soniazid (INH)\n- **P**yrazinamide (PZA)\n- **E**thambutol (EMB)\n- **Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6):** This must be co-administered with isoniazid to prevent peripheral neuropathy, a common side effect.\n\n**4. Baseline Monitoring:** Before initiating this multi-drug regimen, several baseline tests are mandatory to monitor for potential toxicity and to screen for important comorbidities:\n- **Liver Function Tests (LFTs):** Including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and bilirubin, because INH, RIF, and PZA are all potentially hepatotoxic.\n- **Renal Function:** Including serum creatinine, as dosing for some agents (e.g., ethambutol) may require adjustment in renal insufficiency.\n- **Visual Acuity and Color Vision Testing:** To establish a baseline before starting ethambutol, which can cause optic neuritis.\n- **Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Serology:** HIV co-infection is a major risk factor for TB and radically alters management. All patients with TB should be tested.\n- **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** To check for anemia and as a baseline for other hematologic parameters.\n\n**5. Public Health Action:** Active TB is a major public health threat and is a nationally notifiable disease. The local health department must be notified **immediately** (typically within $24$ hours) upon suspicion of active TB. This allows for the initiation of contact tracing and case management, which often includes **Directly Observed Therapy (DOT)** to ensure adherence and prevent the emergence of drug resistance.\n\n**6. Follow-up and Duration:**\n- **Infection Control:** Airborne isolation is maintained until the patient is deemed non-infectious, which requires being on effective therapy, showing clinical improvement, and having $3$ consecutive negative AFB sputum smears.\n- **Efficacy Monitoring:** Clinical (symptom resolution, weight gain) and bacteriological (monthly sputum cultures until conversion) monitoring is required.\n- **Treatment Duration:** For drug-susceptible TB, a standard course is $6$ months ($2$ months of RIPE, followed by $4$ months of INH/RIF). The presence of cavitation on initial chest x-ray with positive cultures at the $2$-month mark may be an indication to extend the continuation phase of therapy.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Place the patient on droplet precautions in a standard room; obtain a single sputum for Acid-Fast Bacillus (AFB) smear and send culture; begin azithromycin and levofloxacin empirically; defer public health notification until culture confirms Mycobacterium tuberculosis; reassess in $72$ hours.**\n- **Isolation:** Incorrect. Droplet precautions are insufficient for TB; airborne precautions are required.\n- **Diagnostics:** Incorrect. A single sputum specimen is insufficient; $3$ are standard. Omitting NAAT is suboptimal.\n- **Regimen:** Incorrect. Azithromycin and levofloxacin are not a standard TB regimen. Using a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin) inappropriately risks selecting for resistance, which compromises future treatment options.\n- **Public Health:** Incorrect. Notification must be immediate upon suspicion, not delayed for culture confirmation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** This plan contains multiple fundamental and dangerous errors.\n\n**B. Place the patient in an Airborne Infection Isolation (AII) negative-pressure room with airborne precautions; collect $3$ sputum specimens ideally $8$ to $24$ hours apart (with at least one early morning specimen) for AFB smear, Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT), and mycobacterial culture with phenotypic drug susceptibility testing; start empiric four-drug therapy with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol with pyridoxine supplementation; obtain baseline laboratory monitoring including Liver Function Tests (LFTs), renal function, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) testing (and pregnancy testing if applicable), and baseline visual acuity and color vision testing for ethambutol; notify the local health department the same day and initiate Directly Observed Therapy (DOT); maintain airborne precautions until the patient is clinically improving, on effective therapy, and has $3$ consecutive negative AFB smears; monitor monthly clinical status, adherence, and toxicity with laboratory evaluation as indicated and repeat sputum cultures until conversion, tailoring duration (typically $6$ months for drug-susceptible disease) and extending therapy if cavitation persists with positive cultures at $2$ months or if drug resistance is identified.**\n- **Isolation:** Correct.\n- **Diagnostics:** Correct. This describes the standard, comprehensive diagnostic approach.\n- **Regimen:** Correct. Standard RIPE therapy with mandatory pyridoxine.\n- **Baseline Monitoring:** Correct. This includes all necessary baseline testing.\n- **Public Health  Adherence:** Correct. Immediate notification and initiation of DOT are standard of care.\n- **Follow-up:** Correct. This describes appropriate criteria for discontinuing isolation, monitoring efficacy and toxicity, and adjusting treatment duration based on response.\n**Verdict: Correct.** This option is a complete and accurate representation of the standard of care for suspected active pulmonary TB.\n\n**C. No isolation is necessary because smear status is unknown; obtain an Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) and await culture results before starting therapy; begin isoniazid monotherapy to minimize toxicity; notify public health only if NAAT is positive; discontinue isoniazid once symptoms improve, regardless of bacteriologic data.**\n- **Isolation:** Incorrect. Isolation is based on clinical suspicion, not on a pending test result. This is a critical break in infection control.\n- **Diagnostics:** Incorrect. An IGRA cannot differentiate between active and latent TB and is not a diagnostic test for active disease. Awaiting culture results before initiating therapy in a symptomatic patient with classic findings is inappropriate.\n- **Regimen:** Incorrect. Isoniazid monotherapy for active TB is malpractice and will rapidly induce drug resistance.\n- **Public Health/Follow-up:** Incorrect on all points.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** This plan is dangerously flawed and contradicts every major principle of TB management.\n\n**D. Place in an AII room; collect $1$ sputum for AFB smear and NAAT; begin rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol without pyridoxine; do not order HIV testing or baseline LFTs; remove airborne precautions after $1$ negative NAAT; notify public health after culture confirms susceptibility.**\n- **Isolation:** Correct room type, but incorrect de-isolation criteria.\n- **Diagnostics:** Incorrect. $1$ sputum is insufficient.\n- **Regimen:** Incorrect. Omission of pyridoxine is substandard care.\n- **Baseline Monitoring:** Incorrect. Failure to order LFTs and HIV testing is a major medical error.\n- **Public Health:** Incorrect. Notification is immediate, not delayed for weeks/months.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** This plan contains multiple significant omissions and errors.\n\n**E. Place in an AII room; because of cavitation, assume multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and start a fluoroquinolone, linezolid, bedaquiline, and clofazimine empirically while deferring rifampin and isoniazid; obtain $2$ sputum NAATs and skip culture; notify public health within $7$ days; discontinue isolation after $2$ negative NAATs regardless of smear results.**\n- **Regimen:** Incorrect. While cavitation is a serious sign, it does not automatically warrant empiric treatment for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in a patient with no prior treatment history, unless specific local epidemiology or exposure history dictates otherwise. The standard is to start with RIPE.\n- **Diagnostics:** Incorrect. Skipping culture is a grave error, as it is the only way to obtain definitive phenotypic DST to guide therapy.\n- **Public Health:** Incorrect. Notification should be immediate (e.g., within $24$ hours), not within $7$ days.\n- **Isolation:** Incorrect de-isolation criteria. Discontinuation of isolation is based on $3$ negative *smears*, not NAATs.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** This plan makes an unsupported assumption about resistance and includes incorrect diagnostic and public health procedures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4785606"}]}
