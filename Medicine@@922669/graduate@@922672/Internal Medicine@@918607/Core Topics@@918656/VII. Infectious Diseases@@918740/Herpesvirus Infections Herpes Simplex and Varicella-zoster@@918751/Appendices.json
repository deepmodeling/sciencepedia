Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on a lesion swab is ordered. The clinical team estimates the pretest probability of VZV reactivation to be $P = 0.60$ based on history and examination. The PCR assay has a base analytic sensitivity $Se_{0} = 0.97$ for specimens collected within $t_{0} = 3$ days of rash onset and analytic specificity $Sp = 0.995$.

It presents a realistic clinical scenario in internal medicine and requires the application of fundamental principles of probability theory (Bayes' theorem) to diagnostic test evaluation. All necessary data are provided, and no contradictions or ambiguities exist.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has a Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) reactivation, and $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not. Let $T^+$ denote a positive PCR test result and $T^-$ denote a negative result.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are:\nThe pretest probability of disease: $P(D) = P = 0.60$.\nThe probability of not having the disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$.\nThe base analytic sensitivity: $Se_{0} = 0.97$.\nThe time threshold for base sensitivity: $t_{0} = 3$ days.\nThe analytic specificity: $Sp = 0.995$.\nThe decay constant for sensitivity: $k = 0.25$ day$^{-1}$.\nThe time of specimen collection: $t = 6$ days.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the sensitivity $Se(t)$ at the time of specimen collection, $t=6$ days.

Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) \\cdot P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test, found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) \\cdot P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) \\cdot P(D)$$\nThe term $P(T^- | D^c)$ is the specificity, $Sp$.
