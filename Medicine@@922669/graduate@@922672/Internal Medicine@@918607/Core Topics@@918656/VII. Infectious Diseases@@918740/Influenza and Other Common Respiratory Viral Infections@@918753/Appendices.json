The odds of an event are defined as the ratio of the probability that the event occurs to the probability that it does not occur.\n\nThe pre-test odds of having the disease, $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}}$, are:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(\\neg D)} = \\frac{P(D)}{1 - P(D)}\n$$\nSubstituting the given value:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{0.20}{1 - 0.20} = \\frac{0.20}{0.80} = 0.25\n$$\nThe odds form of Bayes' theorem states that the post-test odds are equal to the pre-test odds multiplied by the relevant likelihood ratio. For a negative test result, the relevant ratio is the negative likelihood ratio, $LR^-$.\n\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR^{-}\n$$\nThe problem provides $LR^{-} = 0.30$.\nWe can now calculate the post-test odds, $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}$, which are the odds of having the disease given the negative test result:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = 0.25 \\times 0.30 = 0.075\n$$\nThe final step is to convert these post-test odds back into a probability. If the odds of an event are $\\text{Odds}$, the probability $P$ of that event is given by the formula:\n$$\nP = \\frac{\\text{Odds}}{1 + \\text{Odds}}\n$$\nApplying this formula to our post-test odds, we find the post-test probability of bacterial pneumonia, $P(D|T^-)$:\n$$\nP(D|T^-) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}} = \\frac{0.075}{1 + 0.075} = \\frac{0.075}{1.075}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nP(D|T^-) \\approx 0.06976744186...\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $6$, $9$, $7$, and $6$. The fifth significant figure is $7$, which is $\\ge 5$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$\nP(D|T^-) \\approx 0.06977\n$$\nThus, the post-test probability of bacterial pneumonia after a negative procalcitonin test is approximately $0.06977$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.06977}$$", "id": "4856038"}, {"introduction": "When a patient with influenza fails to respond to standard antiviral therapy, a clinician must consider the possibility of drug resistance.

A solution will be derived based on the provided givens and first principles.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe primary task is to analyze the effect of the mutations on inhibitor binding, both thermodynamically and structurally.\n\n**1.

Molecular and Structural Analysis**\n\n**H275Y in Neuraminidase:**\nThe mutation replaces histidine (H) with tyrosine (Y). Histidine has an imidazole side chain, while tyrosine has a larger hydroxyphenyl (phenol) side chain. Position $275$ is located in the NA active site. The bulky aromatic side chain of tyrosine introduced by the H$275$Y mutation causes a steric clash with the pentyl ether group of oseltamivir. This forces a conformational change in the active site that is less favorable for oseltamivir binding, effectively narrowing the hydrophobic pocket required to accommodate the inhibitor. This steric hindrance and resulting destabilization of the drug-protein complex are the primary molecular reasons for the observed $100$-fold increase in $K_d$. Additionally, structural studies suggest this mutation can disrupt stabilizing water-mediated hydrogen bond networks in the active site.\n\n**I38T in PA Endonuclease:**\nThe mutation replaces isoleucine (I) with threonine (T). Isoleucine has a nonpolar, hydrophobic branched alkyl side chain. Threonine's side chain contains a polar hydroxyl group. Position $38$ is part of a hydrophobic pocket within the PA endonuclease active site that accommodates the baloxavir molecule. Baloxavir's mechanism involves chelating two metal ions (typically $\\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$) in the active site, but it also relies on extensive hydrophobic interactions for high-affinity binding. The I$38$T mutation introduces a polar hydroxyl group into this critical hydrophobic pocket. This results in a loss of favorable van der Waals contacts (hydrophobic packing) that would occur with isoleucine and introduces an energetically unfavorable polar-hydrophobic clash between the threonine side chain and the nonpolar parts of baloxavir. This disruption of the hydrophobic pocket near the drug's metal-chelating pharmacophore is the reason for the observed $40$-fold increase in $K_d$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. H$275$Y introduces a bulky aromatic tyrosine that reduces conformational flexibility and narrows the induced hydrophobic pocket required for oseltamivir accommodation, while perturbing a local water-mediated hydrogen bond network; this raises $K_d$ about $100$-fold with $\\Delta\\Delta G^\\circ \\approx RT\\ln(100) \\approx 2.84\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$. I$38$T replaces a nonpolar isoleucine with a polar threonine in the baloxavir-contact hydrophobic pocket, diminishing van der Waals packing and adding steric/polar mismatch near the metal-chelating pharmacophore; this raises $K_d$ about $40$-fold with $\\Delta\\Delta G^\\circ \\approx RT\\ln(40) \\approx 2.27\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$.**\n- This option provides a molecular explanation for both mutations that is fully consistent with the known structural biology of influenza resistance. The description of steric clash for H$275$Y and polar/hydrophobic mismatch for I$38$T is accurate. The calculated values for $\\Delta\\Delta G^\\circ$ precisely match our derivation from the provided $K_d$ values.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. H$275$Y adds a positive charge that strengthens ionic attraction to the oseltamivir carboxylate, lowering $K_d$ and yielding a negative $\\Delta\\Delta G^\\circ$; I$38$T similarly increases baloxavir’s electrostatic interactions with the active site, decreasing $K_d$ and improving potency.**\n- This option is incorrect on multiple counts. First, tyrosine (Y) does not add a positive charge. Second, the mutation *increases* $K_d$ (weakens binding), it does not lower it. Third, this weakening of binding corresponds to a *positive* $\\Delta\\Delta G^\\circ$, not a negative one. The claims for I$38$T are similarly flawed.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. H$275$Y enhances metal chelation in NA’s active site, increasing oseltamivir binding; I$38$T introduces a hydroxyl that directly coordinates the endonuclease metal ion, strengthening baloxavir binding and reducing $K_d$.**\n- This option contains fundamental scientific errors. Neuraminidase is not a metalloenzyme, so there is no metal chelation to enhance. Furthermore, both mutations *weaken* binding and increase $K_d$, contrary to the claims made in this option.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Both mutations primarily reduce catalytic turnover ($V_{\\max}$) without materially changing inhibitor binding ($K_d$). The implied $\\Delta\\Delta G^\\circ$ changes are small, approximately $1.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$ for H$275$Y and $3.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$ for I$38$T.**\n- This option directly contradicts the provided data, which state that $K_d$ changes materially (by $100$-fold and $40$-fold). The calculated $\\Delta\\Delta G^\\circ$ values in the option are also inconsistent with the provided data.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. H$275$Y creates a new hydrogen bond with the inhibitor’s guanidino group, improving oseltamivir binding and lowering $K_d$; I$38$T increases hydrophobic contacts with baloxavir, lowering $K_d$ and producing a favorable (negative) $\\Delta\\Delta G^\\circ$ for both inhibitors.**\n- This option is flawed. Oseltamivir does not have a guanidino group (zanamivir does). The mutation weakens binding, it does not improve it. I$38$T replaces a hydrophobic residue with a polar one, which *decreases* hydrophobic contacts, not increases them. It also falsely claims that $K_d$ is lowered and $\\Delta\\Delta G^\\circ$ is negative.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation, only option A aligns with the thermodynamic calculations and provides an accurate molecular-level explanation consistent with established structural biology.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4856094"}]}
