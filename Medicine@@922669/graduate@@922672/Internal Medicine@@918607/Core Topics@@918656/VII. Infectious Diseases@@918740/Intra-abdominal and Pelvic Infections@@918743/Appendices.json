It requests the calculation of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, a standard and formalizable clinical tool, based on a realistic set of patient parameters.\n\nThe SOFA score is a system used in intensive care units to track a patient's status and quantify the degree of organ dysfunction. It comprises six subscores, one for each major organ system (respiratory, coagulation, hepatic, cardiovascular, central nervous system, and renal). Each subscore ranges from $0$ (normal function) to $4$ (most severe dysfunction), leading to a total score from $0$ to $24$. A higher score indicates more severe organ failure and is associated with increased mortality. We will calculate the subscore for each organ system based on the provided clinical parameters.\n\n1.  **Respiratory System**\n    The score is determined by the ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen ($\\mathrm{PaO_2}$) to the fraction of inspired oxygen ($\\mathrm{FiO_2}$), denoted as the $P/F$ ratio. The patient is receiving invasive mechanical ventilation.\n    Given: $\\mathrm{PaO_2} = 85 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ and $\\mathrm{FiO_2} = 0.50$.\n    The $P/F$ ratio is calculated as:\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{PaO_2}}{\\mathrm{FiO_2}} = \\frac{85}{0.50} = 170 $$\n    The SOFA criteria for the respiratory system score (with mechanical ventilation) are:\n    - Score $0$: $P/F \\ge 400$\n    - Score $1$: $P/F < 400$\n    - Score $2$: $P/F < 300$\n    - Score $3$: $P/F < 200$\n    - Score $4$: $P/F < 100$\n    A ratio of $170$ falls into the category $P/F < 200$. Therefore, the respiratory subscore is $3$.\n\n2.  **Coagulation System**\n    The score is based on the platelet count.\n    Given: Platelet count is $72 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$ (or $72,000/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$).\n    The SOFA criteria for coagulation are:\n    - Score $0$: Platelets $\\ge 150 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$\n    - Score $1$: Platelets $< 150 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$\n    - Score $2$: Platelets $< 100 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$\n    - Score $3$: Platelets $< 50 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$\n    - Score $4$: Platelets $< 20 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$\n    The patient's platelet count of $72 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$ is less than $100 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$ but not less than $50 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$. Therefore, the coagulation subscore is $2$.\n\n3.  **Hepatic System**\n    The score is determined by the serum total bilirubin level.\n    Given: Total bilirubin is $3.2 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n    The SOFA criteria for the hepatic system are:\n    - Score $0$: Bilirubin $< 1.2 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n    - Score $1$: Bilirubin $1.2-1.9 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n    - Score $2$: Bilirubin $2.0-5.9 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n    - Score $3$: Bilirubin $6.0-11.9 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n    - Score $4$: Bilirubin $\\ge 12.0 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n    The bilirubin level of $3.2 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$ falls within the range $2.0-5.9 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$. Therefore, the hepatic subscore is $2$.\n\n4.  **Cardiovascular System**\n    The score is based on the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the requirement for vasopressor medications.\n    Given: $\\mathrm{MAP} = 62 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ and the patient is receiving a norepinephrine infusion at $0.12 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{min}$.\n    The SOFA criteria for the cardiovascular system are:\n    - Score $0$: $\\mathrm{MAP} \\ge 70 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n    - Score $1$: $\\mathrm{MAP} < 70 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n    - Score $2$: Dopamine $\\le 5 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{min}$ or any dose of dobutamine\n    - Score $3$: Dopamine $> 5 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{min}$ or epinephrine/norepinephrine $\\le 0.1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{min}$\n    - Score $4$: Dopamine $> 15 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{min}$ or epinephrine/norepinephrine $> 0.1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{min}$\n    The patient has hypotension ($\\mathrm{MAP} < 70 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$) and is on a norepinephrine infusion at a dose of $0.12 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{min}$, which is greater than $0.1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{min}$. Therefore, the cardiovascular subscore is $4$.\n\n5.  **Central Nervous System (CNS)**\n    The score is assessed using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).\n    Given: Pre-sedation GCS is 10.\n    The SOFA criteria for the CNS are:\n    - Score $0$: GCS 15\n    - Score $1$: GCS 13-14\n    - Score $2$: GCS 10-12\n    - Score $3$: GCS 6-9\n    - Score $4$: GCS $< 6$\n    The patient's GCS of $10$ falls within the range $10-12$. Therefore, the CNS subscore is $2$.\n\n6.  **Renal System**\n    The score is determined by either the serum creatinine level or the urine output, whichever is worse (i.e., corresponds to a higher score).\n    Given: Serum creatinine is $2.8 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$ and urine output is $450 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$ over the prior $24$ hours.\n    The SOFA criteria for the renal system are:\n    - Creatinine ($\\mathrm{mg/dL}$):\n        - Score $0$: $< 1.2$\n        - Score $1$: $1.2-1.9$\n        - Score $2$: $2.0-3.4$\n        - Score $3$: $3.5-4.9$\n        - Score $4$: $> 5.0$\n    - Urine Output ($\\mathrm{mL/day}$):\n        - Score $3$: $< 500$\n        - Score $4$: $< 200$\n    Based on the creatinine level of $2.8 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$, the score is $2$.\n    Based on the urine output of $450 \\ \\mathrm{mL/day}$, the score is $3$ (as $450 < 500$).\n    Following the rule to take the worse parameter, the renal subscore is $3$.\n\n**Total SOFA Score and Interpretation**\nThe total SOFA score is the sum of the individual subscores:\nTotal SOFA Score $= \\text{Respiratory} + \\text{Coagulation} + \\text{Hepatic} + \\text{Cardiovascular} + \\text{CNS} + \\text{Renal}$\nTotal SOFA Score $= 3 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 3 = 16$.\n\nA total SOFA score of $16$ signifies severe multi-organ dysfunction. According to Sepsis-$3$ consensus definitions, a SOFA score of $2$ or more from baseline indicates sepsis. The mortality rate in critically ill patients increases substantially with the SOFA score. Published data from large cohorts consistently show that a SOFA score in the range of $15-16$ is associated with a very high hospital mortality risk, often cited as being greater than $50\\%$ and approaching $80\\%$ or higher in some studies. Therefore, the qualitative interpretation for a SOFA score of $16$ is **high** hospital mortality risk.\nThe final answer required is the total SOFA score as a unitless integer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{16}\n$$", "id": "4858018"}, {"introduction": "Choosing empiric antibiotics for severe intra-abdominal infections is a high-stakes decision, complicated by the rising prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms.
