The derivation must proceed from the fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and Bayes' theorem. Let us define the relevant events and probabilities based on the problem statement.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has *Clostridioides difficile* infection (CDI), and let $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have CDI.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the stool toxin enzyme immunoassay (EIA) test result is positive, and let $T^-$ be the event that the test result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe prevalence of CDI, $P$, is the prior probability that a patient has the disease:\n$$ P(D) = P = 0.25 $$\nThe probability that a patient does not have the disease is the complement of the prevalence:\n$$ P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - P = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 $$\nThe sensitivity of the test, $Se$, is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease:\n$$ Se = P(T^+ | D) = 0.70 $$\nThe specificity of the test, $Sp$, is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease:\n$$ Sp = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95 $$\n\nThe quantity to be determined is the Positive Predictive Value (PPV). The PPV is defined as the probability that a patient has the disease given that they have a positive test result, which is the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, which can be rearranged into the form known as Bayes' theorem, we can express the PPV as:\n$$ PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, represents the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. We can calculate this using the law of total probability, summing over the two mutually exclusive states of having the disease ($D$) or not having the disease ($D^c$):\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\nThe first term, $P(T^+ | D)$, is the sensitivity, $Se$. The second term, $P(T^+ | D^c)$, is the probability of a positive test in a patient without the disease (a false positive). This is the complement of the specificity, $Sp$, since for a patient without the disease, the test can be either positive or negative.\n$$ P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp $$\nSubstituting the terms $Se$, $Sp$, and $P$ into the expression for $P(T^+)$, we get:\n$$ P(T^+) = (Se \\cdot P) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P)) $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $P(T^+)$ back into the Bayes' theorem formula for PPV:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)} $$\nThis yields the final derived expression for PPV in terms of sensitivity ($Se$), specificity ($Sp$), and prevalence ($P$):\n$$ PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot P}{Se \\cdot P + (1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P)} $$\nThis completes the derivation part of the task.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of the PPV using the given parameters: $Se = 0.70$, $Sp = 0.95$, and $P = 0.25$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{(0.70)(0.25)}{(0.70)(0.25) + (1 - 0.95)(1 - 0.25)} $$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\nThe numerator is the probability of a true positive:\n$$ Se \\cdot P = 0.70 \\times 0.25 = 0.175 $$\nThe second term in the denominator is the probability of a false positive:\n$$ (1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P) = (1 - 0.95) \\times (1 - 0.25) = 0.05 \\times 0.75 = 0.0375 $$\nNow, we substitute these back into the PPV equation:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{0.175}{0.175 + 0.0375} $$\n$$ PPV = \\frac{0.175}{0.2125} $$\nPerforming the division:\n$$ PPV \\approx 0.82352941176... $$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ PPV \\approx 0.8235 $$\nThus, the positive predictive value of the toxin EIA in this inpatient population is approximately $0.8235$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8235}$$", "id": "4816273"}, {"introduction": "Modern CDI diagnostics often involve multi-step algorithms that can yield conflicting results, creating clinical uncertainty.

The clinical team estimates a pre-test probability of toxigenic Clostridioides difficile infection of $p_0 = 0.25$ based on symptom timing, risk factors, and absence of alternative causes. The laboratory uses a multistep algorithm: glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) immunoassay, toxin enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) as a tie-breaker when GDH and toxin EIA are discordant. For this patient, the stool results are GDH positive, toxin EIA negative, and NAAT positive, with the NAAT reporting a cycle threshold of $C_t = 33$.\n\nFrom well-tested clinical validation studies, assume the following performance characteristics referenced to a toxin activity standard (Cell Cytotoxicity Neutralization Assay (CCNA) positivity as the disease definition):\n- GDH: sensitivity $= 0.95$, specificity $= 0.75$.\n- Toxin EIA: sensitivity $= 0.60$, specificity $= 0.95$.\n- NAAT: when positive, the strength of evidence depends on bacterial burden estimated by $C_t$.

It presents a common and challenging clinical scenario in infectious diseases. The diagnostic algorithm (GDH/EIA with NAAT as a tie-breaker) is consistent with current guidelines from major societies (e.g., IDSA/SHEA). The use of CCNA as a reference standard, though mostly historical, is appropriate for defining test characteristics. The concept of using $C_t$ values to quantify bacterial burden and stratify NAAT results is a key area of current research and clinical practice aimed at distinguishing colonization from active infection. The provided test performance values are plausible.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary quantitative information (pre-test probability, test results, and performance characteristics in the form of sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios) to arrive at a unique post-test probability.

All data are presented as quantitative parameters.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no internal contradictions or missing information. The solution process can proceed.\n\n## Solution Derivation ##\n\nThe goal is to calculate the post-test probability of active CDI given the test results and a pre-test probability of $p_0 = 0.25$. We will use the odds-likelihood ratio formulation of Bayes' theorem. Let $D$ be the event of active disease (CCNA positive).\n\n1.  **Calculate Pre-test Odds**:\n    The pre-test probability is $P(D) = 0.25$.\n    The pre-test odds are calculated as:\n    $$\n    \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(D)}{1 - P(D)} = \\frac{0.25}{1 - 0.25} = \\frac{0.25}{0.75} = \\frac{1}{3}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Likelihood Ratio (LR) for each Test Result**:\n    - **GDH Positive (GDH+)**: This corresponds to the positive likelihood ratio, $LR^+$.\n    $$\n    LR(\\text{GDH+}) = \\frac{\\text{sensitivity}}{\\text{1 - specificity}} = \\frac{S_e(\\text{GDH})}{1 - S_p(\\text{GDH})} = \\frac{0.95}{1 - 0.75} = \\frac{0.95}{0.25} = 3.8\n    $$\n    - **Toxin EIA Negative (EIA−)**: This corresponds to the negative likelihood ratio, $LR^-$.\n    $$\n    LR(\\text{EIA−}) = \\frac{\\text{1 - sensitivity}}{\\text{specificity}} = \\frac{1 - S_e(\\text{EIA})}{S_p(\\text{EIA})} = \\frac{1 - 0.60}{0.95} = \\frac{0.40}{0.95} = \\frac{40}{95} = \\frac{8}{19}\n    $$\n    - **NAAT Positive (NAAT+) with $C_t = 33$**: The problem provides the stratified $LR^+$ directly. Since $33 > 30$, we use the corresponding value.\n    $$\n    LR(\\text{NAAT+}, C_t=33) = 1.5\n    $$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Combined Likelihood Ratio**:\n    Based on the problem's assumption, we multiply the individual likelihood ratios.\n    $$\n    LR_{\\text{combined}} = LR(\\text{GDH+}) \\times LR(\\text{EIA−}) \\times LR(\\text{NAAT+}, C_t=33)\n    $$\n    $$\n    LR_{\\text{combined}} = 3.8 \\times \\frac{8}{19} \\times 1.5 = \\frac{38}{10} \\times \\frac{8}{19} \\times \\frac{15}{10} = \\frac{2 \\times 19}{10} \\times \\frac{8}{19} \\times \\frac{15}{10} = \\frac{2 \\times 8 \\times 15}{100} = \\frac{240}{100} = 2.4\n    $$\n\n4.  **Calculate Post-test Odds**:\n    The post-test odds are the product of the pre-test odds and the combined likelihood ratio.\n    $$\n    \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR_{\\text{combined}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 2.4 = 0.8\n    $$\n\n5.  **Calculate Post-test Probability**:\n    Finally, we convert the post-test odds back to a probability.\n    $$\n    P_{\\text{post}}(D) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}} = \\frac{0.8}{1 + 0.8} = \\frac{0.8}{1.8} = \\frac{8}{18} = \\frac{4}{9}\n    $$\n    This probability is approximately $P_{\\text{post}}(D) \\approx 0.444$, or $44.4\\%$.\n\n### Interpretation and Option Analysis\n\nThe post-test probability of active CDI is approximately $44\\%$. This is an intermediate probability, residing in a zone of diagnostic uncertainty. The probability of active disease has increased from the initial $25\\%$, but it is still less than $50\\%$. This means it is marginally more likely that the patient does *not* have active CDI ($P(\\neg D) = 1 - 4/9 = 5/9 \\approx 56\\%$). In this clinical context (GDH+ and NAAT+), the absence of active disease implies colonization with a toxigenic strain. The low evidentiary strength of the high-$C_t$ NAAT ($LR^+=1.5$) was not enough to overcome the strong negative evidence from the toxin EIA ($LR^- \\approx 0.42$).\n\n**A. Most likely colonization with a toxigenic Clostridioides difficile strain given low bacterial burden ($C_t > 30$) and toxin negativity; defer anti–Clostridioides difficile therapy, and resolve uncertainty by either obtaining a CCNA or using a burden threshold (e.g., treat only if $C_t \\le 26$ or if clinical severity increases).**\n- **Interpretation**: The statement \"Most likely colonization\" is consistent with our finding that the probability of active disease is less than $50\\%$. The reasoning provided (low burden from high $C_t$ and toxin negativity) accurately identifies the key drivers of this conclusion.\n- **Management**: The proposed plan—deferring therapy and seeking more information—is the standard approach for intermediate-probability results. The methods for resolving uncertainty are sound: using the gold standard test (CCNA), applying a more stringent, evidence-based cutoff for treatment (e.g., lower $C_t$), or monitoring the patient's clinical status. This represents excellent clinical and scientific reasoning.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Most likely active Clostridioides difficile infection because any NAAT positivity establishes disease; start oral vancomycin immediately and do not pursue further testing or thresholds.**\n- **Interpretation**: \"Most likely active...infection\" is quantitatively false; the calculated probability is $44\\%$.\n- **Reasoning**: The statement \"any NAAT positivity establishes disease\" is a critical error. It ignores the significant issue of colonization and contradicts the problem's own data, which stratifies NAAT results by $C_t$ value. Treating NAAT as a simple binary test is a known pitfall.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The NAAT is most likely a false positive; disregard GDH and NAAT, rely solely on toxin EIA, and avoid treatment even if symptoms persist.**\n- **Interpretation**: The NAAT is likely a true positive for the presence of the toxin gene, distinguishing it from a \"false positive\" in the analytical sense. The result is a \"false positive\" for disease, but not for the gene. Advocating to \"disregard GDH and NAAT\" is unscientific; an integrated approach is superior.\n- **Management**: The advice to \"avoid treatment even if symptoms persist\" is clinically dangerous and unacceptable. Clinical deterioration always warrants reconsideration of the diagnosis and treatment plan.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Treat empirically with fidaxomicin immediately and repeat NAAT; if the repeat NAAT remains positive, continue treatment irrespective of $C_t$, toxin EIA, or clinical trajectory.**\n- **Interpretation**: Immediate treatment is not supported by the $44\\%$ post-test probability.\n- **Management**: Using repeat NAAT as a \"test of cure\" for CDI is not recommended. The test can remain positive for weeks after clinical resolution and does not reliably indicate treatment failure. Making treatment decisions \"irrespective of...clinical trajectory\" is a grave medical error.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Most likely colonization; however, initiate therapy when $C_t \\le 35$ because this threshold reliably distinguishes disease from colonization without additional assays.**\n- **Interpretation**: \"Most likely colonization\" is a correct assessment.\n- **Management**: The proposed threshold ($C_t \\le 35$) would lead to treating this patient ($C_t=33$). However, the problem's data for $C_t > 30$ gives an $LR^+$ of only $1.5$, suggesting this range provides very weak evidence for disease. A threshold of $35$ is therefore unlikely to be \"reliable,\" as it would be even less specific for active infection. The claim of reliability is a strong one and is not supported by the data provided or by general consensus in the field.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4816255"}, {"introduction": "Effective treatment of CDI can be compromised by concurrent medications, a common issue in hospitalized patients with multiple comorbidities.

The fractional effect, $E$, is proportional to $\\frac{C}{C + EC_{50}}$, with $EC_{50} = 8\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\nLet $E_{\\text{no resin}}$ be the efficacy without cholestyramine, where the concentration is $C_0 = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$:\n$$ E_{\\text{no resin}} \\propto \\frac{1000}{1000 + 8} = \\frac{1000}{1008} $$\nLet $E_{\\text{with resin}}$ be the efficacy with cholestyramine, where the free concentration is $C_{\\mathrm{free}} \\approx 36.11\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$:\n$$ E_{\\text{with resin}} \\propto \\frac{36.11}{36.11 + 8} = \\frac{36.11}{44.11} $$\nThe ratio of efficacies is:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{E_{\\text{with resin}}}{E_{\\text{no resin}}} = \\frac{\\frac{36.11}{44.11}}{\\frac{1000}{1008}} = \\frac{36.11}{44.11} \\times \\frac{1008}{1000} $$\nUsing more precise intermediate values for the calculation:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\frac{36.1075}{44.1075}}{\\frac{1000}{1008}} = \\frac{36.1075}{44.1075} \\times 1.008 \\approx 0.818625 \\times 1.008 \\approx 0.825174 $$\nRounding the final result to three significant figures, the ratio is $0.825$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.825}\n$$", "id": "4816259"}]}
