The calculated time lag $\\Delta t = 6.00\\,\\text{min}$ is clinically significant. During a rapid decline in plasma glucose, the continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which measures interstitial glucose $G_{i}(t)$, will report a value that is higher than the true, simultaneous plasma glucose $G_{p}(t)$. Specifically, the CGM reading at time $t$ will approximate the plasma glucose from approximately $6$ minutes prior, i.e., $G_{i}(t) \\approx G_{p}(t-\\Delta t)$. Since glucose is falling ($r>0$), this means $G_{i}(t) > G_{p}(t)$. This discrepancy has critical consequences:\n1.  **Delayed Hypoglycemia Detection**: A CGM may fail to issue a low-glucose alert in a timely manner. The patient's plasma glucose could fall into the hypoglycemic range (e.g., below $70\\,\\text{mg/dL}$) several minutes before the interstitial glucose reading crosses that same threshold. This delay postpones corrective actions, such as consuming carbohydrates, increasing the risk of severe hypoglycemia.\n2.  **Inaccurate Treatment Decisions**: Clinical decisions based solely on the CGM number during rapid changes can be erroneous. For example, a clinician or an automated insulin delivery system, observing a rapidly falling glucose level that is still in the normal range, might not intervene aggressively enough, underestimating the immediacy of the hypoglycemic threat. Conversely, during a rapid glucose rise, the CGM reading will lag behind and be lower than the plasma value, which could lead to inappropriate insulin dosing. Therefore, during periods of high glucose flux, reliance on trend information (e.g., trend arrows on CGM devices) is more important than the absolute number, and confirmation with a fingerstick blood glucose meter is often advisable.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{6.00}\n$$", "id": "4849968"}, {"introduction": "The effective management of severe hypoglycemia often requires intravenous dextrose.
