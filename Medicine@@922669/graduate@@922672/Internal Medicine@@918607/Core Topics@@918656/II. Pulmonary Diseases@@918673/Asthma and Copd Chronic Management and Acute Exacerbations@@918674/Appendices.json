A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested: determining bronchodilator responsiveness, providing a clinical interpretation, and computing the specified proportional increase.\n\n**Part 1: Assessment of Bronchodilator Responsiveness**\nThe ATS/ERS criteria define a significant bronchodilator response as an increase of greater than $12\\%$ **and** an absolute increase of greater than $200 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$ (which is equivalent to $0.2 \\ \\mathrm{L}$) in either $FEV_1$ or $FVC$ from the baseline (pre-bronchodilator) measurement.\n\nFirst, we calculate the absolute and proportional changes for both $FEV_1$ and $FVC$.\n\nFor $FEV_1$:\nThe absolute change is denoted by $\\Delta FEV_1$.\n$$ \\Delta FEV_1 = FEV_{1,\\ \\mathrm{post}} - FEV_{1,\\ \\mathrm{pre}} = 1.9 \\ \\mathrm{L} - 1.6 \\ \\mathrm{L} = 0.3 \\ \\mathrm{L} $$\nThe proportional change, $r_{FEV_1}$, relative to the pre-bronchodilator value is:\n$$ r_{FEV_1} = \\frac{\\Delta FEV_1}{FEV_{1,\\ \\mathrm{pre}}} = \\frac{0.3 \\ \\mathrm{L}}{1.6 \\ \\mathrm{L}} = 0.1875 $$\nTo compare with the criteria, we express this as a percentage: $0.1875 \\times 100\\% = 18.75\\%$.\n\nNow, we check these results against the ATS/ERS thresholds for $FEV_1$:\n1.  Is the absolute change $ 0.2 \\ \\mathrm{L}$? Yes, $0.3 \\ \\mathrm{L}  0.2 \\ \\mathrm{L}$.\n2.  Is the proportional change $ 12\\%$? Yes, $18.75\\% > 12\\%$.\nSince both conditions are met for $FEV_1$, a significant bronchodilator response is present. We do not need to evaluate $FVC$ to confirm responsiveness, but we will do so for completeness.\n\nFor $FVC$:\nThe absolute change is denoted by $\\Delta FVC$.\n$$ \\Delta FVC = FVC_{\\mathrm{post}} - FVC_{\\mathrm{pre}} = 3.3 \\ \\mathrm{L} - 3.2 \\ \\mathrm{L} = 0.1 \\ \\mathrm{L} $$\nThe proportional change, $r_{FVC}$, relative to the pre-bronchodilator value is:\n$$ r_{FVC} = \\frac{\\Delta FVC}{FVC_{\\mathrm{pre}}} = \\frac{0.1 \\ \\mathrm{L}}{3.2 \\ \\mathrm{L}} \\approx 0.03125 $$\nExpressed as a percentage: $0.03125 \\times 100\\% = 3.125\\%$.\n\nWe check these results against the ATS/ERS thresholds for $FVC$:\n1.  Is the absolute change $ 0.2 \\ \\mathrm{L}$? No, $0.1 \\ \\mathrm{L} \\le 0.2 \\ \\mathrm{L}$.\n2.  Is the proportional change $ 12\\%$? No, $3.125\\% \\le 12\\%$.\nThe criteria for a significant response are not met for $FVC$.\n\nConclusion for Part 1: A significant bronchodilator response is present, as defined by the ATS/ERS criteria, based on the observed changes in $FEV_1$.\n\n**Part 2: Clinical Interpretation**\nA significant positive response to a bronchodilator is the physiological hallmark of reversible airway obstruction. This reversibility is a key characteristic of asthma. While patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) may exhibit some degree of bronchodilator responsiveness, it is typically less pronounced. A robust response, such as the $18.75\\%$ and $300 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$ increase in $FEV_1$ observed here, strongly favors a diagnosis of asthma over classic COPD. Furthermore, the patient's age of $42$ and clinical history of \"recurrent episodic wheeze\" are more typical for asthma, which often presents earlier in life with intermittent symptoms, than for COPD, which is more commonly diagnosed in older individuals with a history of significant toxic inhalation, such as cigarette smoke.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Proportional Increase in $FEV_1$**\nThe problem requires the computation of the proportional increase in $FEV_1$, $r_{FEV_1}$, using the provided formula.\n$$ r_{FEV_1} = \\frac{FEV_{1,\\ \\mathrm{post}} - FEV_{1,\\ \\mathrm{pre}}}{FEV_{1,\\ \\mathrm{pre}}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ r_{FEV_1} = \\frac{1.9 - 1.6}{1.6} = \\frac{0.3}{1.6} $$\nPerforming the division:\n$$ r_{FEV_1} = 0.1875 $$\nThe problem asks for this value to be reported as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.

It integrates four key parameters that capture the systemic and pulmonary manifestations of the disease. A total score is calculated by summing the points assigned to each of the four components.

This value falls within the range of $35\\%-49\\%$. This corresponds to $\\mathbf{2}$ points.\n\n- **Dyspnea (D) Component**: The patient reports an mMRC dyspnea grade of $3$. This corresponds to $\\mathbf{2}$ points.\n\n- **Exercise Capacity (E) Component**: The patient's 6MWD is $200\\,\\mathrm{m}$. This distance falls within the range of $150-249\\,\\mathrm{m}$.

Validation studies have stratified patients into four quartiles of mortality risk based on their BODE score. A score of $7$ places this patient in the highest risk quartile (Quartile $4$, scores $7-10$). This score is associated with a significantly elevated risk of mortality. Specifically, the approximate survival rate for patients in this quartile is only about $25\\%$ at $52$ months, indicating a very poor prognosis.\n\nThe counseling for this patient must be framed by this high-risk stratification. It is imperative to engage in a frank and empathetic discussion about goals of care, including advance care planning and palliative care considerations, while also emphasizing evidence-based interventions that can improve symptoms, quality of life, and potentially modify the disease trajectory.\n\nKey counseling points and prioritized interventions should focus on the modifiable components of the BODE index and overall COPD management:\n\n1.  **Pulmonary Rehabilitation:** This is the highest priority intervention. The patient has severe dyspnea (mMRC $3$) and severely limited exercise capacity (6MWD $200\\,\\mathrm{m}$), both of which are major contributors to his BODE score and poor quality of life. A comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation program is a multicomponent intervention that includes structured exercise training, education, and breathing techniques. It is proven to improve exercise capacity (increasing 6MWD), reduce the sensation of dyspnea (lowering the mMRC score), enhance quality of life, and reduce hospitalizations.\n\n2.  **Nutritional Support:** The patient's BMI of $20\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ contributes a point to his score and represents a state of low body mass, a well-established independent risk factor for mortality in COPD. This patient is at high risk for cachexia. A formal nutritional assessment by a dietitian should be initiated. Counseling should focus on strategies to increase caloric and protein intake to prevent further weight loss and ideally promote weight gain, which can improve respiratory muscle function and overall prognosis.\n\nIn addition to these prioritized interventions, comprehensive management would also include verifying optimization of pharmacotherapy (e.g., dual long-acting bronchodilators), ensuring up-to-date vaccinations (influenza, pneumococcus), reinforcing smoking cessation, and assessing for long-term oxygen therapy if the patient meets criteria for resting or exertional hypoxemia.
