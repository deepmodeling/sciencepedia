Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result. The problem provides the following probabilities:\n\n1.  The prevalence of colorectal cancer, which is the pretest probability of having the disease: $P(D) = 0.007$.\n2.

We need to find $P(T^+ | D^c)$, which is the false positive rate.
