The CAPRA score is a widely used and validated risk stratification tool in the management of prostate cancer. The parameters provided (age, PSA, Gleason score, clinical stage, percentage of positive cores) are the exact inputs for the CAPRA model. The values themselves are clinically plausible and routinely encountered in practice.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for the calculation of a score using a defined, deterministic algorithm (the CAPRA system) with a complete set of input data. This ensures a unique, meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated with objective clinical data and asks for a calculation based on an established medical standard. There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score is an integer-based point system, ranging from $0$ to $10$, used to stratify patients with localized prostate cancer into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk categories for disease recurrence and mortality. The score is calculated by summing points assigned to five pre-treatment variables. We will now compute the score for the given patient based on the established CAPRA system.\n\n1.  **Age at Diagnosis**: The patient's age is $58$ years. The CAPRA system assigns points for age as follows:\n    - Age $ 50$ years: $0$ points\n    - Age $\\ge 50$ years: $1$ point\n    Since the patient is $58$ years old, which is $\\ge 50$, he is assigned $1$ point for this variable.\n\n2.  **Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) at Diagnosis**: The patient's PSA level is $9.5$ ng/mL. The CAPRA points for PSA are:\n    - PSA $\\le 6.0$ ng/mL: $0$ points\n    - PSA $ 6.0$ to $\\le 10.0$ ng/mL: $1$ point\n    - PSA $ 10.0$ to $\\le 20.0$ ng/mL: $2$ points\n    - PSA $ 20.0$ to $\\le 30.0$ ng/mL: $3$ points\n    - PSA $ 30.0$ ng/mL: $4$ points\n    The patient's PSA of $9.5$ ng/mL falls into the range $(6.0, 10.0]$. He is therefore assigned $1$ point.\n\n3.  **Gleason Score from Biopsy**: The patient's biopsy result is a Grade Group $2$, which corresponds to a Gleason score of $3+4=7$. The points for this variable are:\n    - Gleason score $2-6$ (Grade Group $1$): $0$ points\n    - Gleason score $3+4=7$ (Grade Group $2$): $1$ point\n    - Gleason score $4+3=7$ (Grade Group $3$): $3$ points\n    - Gleason score $8-10$ (Grade Group $4-5$): $4$ points\n    The patient's Gleason score of $3+4$ corresponds to Grade Group $2$, thus assigning him $1$ point. It is critical to distinguish this from a Gleason score of $4+3$, which indicates a more aggressive cancer and receives more points.\n\n4.  **Clinical Stage**: The patient's clinical stage is T2a. The CAPRA system allocates points for clinical stage as follows:\n    - Stage $T1$ or $T2$: $0$ points\n    - Stage $T3a$: $1$ point\n    The patient's stage T2a falls within the $T2$ category, so he receives $0$ points.\n\n5.  **Percentage of Biopsy Cores with Cancer**: The patient has $20\\%$ of biopsy cores positive for cancer. The scoring is:\n    - Percent cores positive $ 34\\%$: $0$ points\n    - Percent cores positive $\\ge 34\\%$: $1$ point\n    The patient's value of $20\\%$ is less than $34\\%$, so he is assigned $0$ points for this parameter.\n\n**Total CAPRA Score Calculation**:\nThe total CAPRA score is the sum of the points from each of the five categories:\n$$ \\text{Total Score} = (\\text{Age points}) + (\\text{PSA points}) + (\\text{Gleason points}) + (\\text{Stage points}) + (\\text{Cores points}) $$\n$$ \\text{Total Score} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3 $$\nThe computed CAPRA score for this patient is $3$.\n\n**Risk Stratification and Management Implications**:\nBased on the total CAPRA score, patients are stratified into risk groups:\n- **Low Risk**: Score $0-2$\n- **Intermediate Risk**: Score $3-5$\n- **High Risk**: Score $6-10$\n\nA CAPRA score of $3$ places this patient in the **intermediate-risk** category. For localized, intermediate-risk prostate cancer, several management strategies are considered valid first-line options. These include radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), and brachytherapy (prostate seed implant). Active surveillance may be an option for select patients with favorable intermediate-risk disease, but a score of $3$ (driven by age, PSA, and Gleason $3+4$) suggests that definitive treatment is more commonly recommended.\n\nThe role of an internal medicine physician is to assess the patient's overall health, life expectancy, and comorbidities to help determine his fitness for these various treatments, each of which carries its own profile of risks and side effects (e.g., erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, bowel issues). The final decision on management is made through a shared decision-making process involving the patient, his urologist, and potentially a radiation oncologist, after a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of each approach in the context of his specific clinical profile and personal preferences.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$", "id": "4889901"}, {"introduction": "Following primary treatment for prostate cancer, monitoring for biochemical recurrence is critical.

It provides a set of clinical data and requests calculations and interpretation based on standard, formalizable models (linear and exponential regression) used in oncology for tracking biomarkers. All necessary data and methods are specified, and the context is realistic. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is provided below.\n\nThe patient's Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) data are given at three time points. For calculation purposes, time $t$ is expressed in years. Let $y(t)$ represent the PSA level in ng/mL. The provided data points $(t, y)$ are:\n- $t_1 = 0$ months $= 0$ years, $y_1 = 0.3$ ng/mL\n- $t_2 = 6$ months $= 0.5$ years, $y_2 = 0.45$ ng/mL\n- $t_3 = 12$ months $= 1.0$ year, $y_3 = 0.68$ ng/mL\n\nWe have $n=3$ data points: $(0, 0.3)$, $(0.5, 0.45)$, and $(1.0, 0.68)$.\n\n**1. PSA Velocity Calculation**\n\nPSA velocity is estimated as the slope of a straight line, $y(t) = at + b$, fitted to the PSA versus time data using the principle of least squares. The slope $a$ represents the PSA velocity. For a set of $n$ data points $(t_i, y_i)$, the formula for the slope $a$ is:\n$$a = \\frac{n \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} t_i y_i\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} t_i\\right) \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i\\right)}{n \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} t_i^2\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} t_i\\right)^2}$$\n\nFirst, we compute the required sums:\n$$ \\sum t_i = 0 + 0.5 + 1.0 = 1.5 $$\n$$ \\sum y_i = 0.3 + 0.45 + 0.68 = 1.43 $$\n$$ \\sum t_i^2 = 0^2 + (0.5)^2 + (1.0)^2 = 0 + 0.25 + 1.0 = 1.25 $$\n$$ \\sum t_i y_i = (0)(0.3) + (0.5)(0.45) + (1.0)(0.68) = 0 + 0.225 + 0.68 = 0.905 $$\n\nNow, substitute these sums into the formula for the slope $a$:\n$$ a = \\frac{3(0.905) - (1.5)(1.43)}{3(1.25) - (1.5)^2} = \\frac{2.715 - 2.145}{3.75 - 2.25} = \\frac{0.57}{1.5} = 0.38 $$\nThe PSA velocity is $0.38$ ng/mL per year. Rounded to three significant figures, this is $0.380$ ng/mL per year.\n\n**2. PSA Doubling Time Calculation**\n\nPSA doubling time is estimated assuming an exponential growth model, $y(t) = y_0 \\exp(kt)$, where $k$ is the constant growth rate and $y_0$ is the PSA value at $t=0$. To find $k$, we linearize this model by taking the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\ln(y(t)) = \\ln(y_0 \\exp(kt)) = \\ln(y_0) + kt $$\nThis equation is of the form $z(t) = c + mt$, where $z(t) = \\ln(y(t))$, the intercept is $c = \\ln(y_0)$, and the slope is $m = k$. We fit a straight line to the data points $(t_i, \\ln(y_i))$ using least squares to find the slope $k$.\n\nThe transformed data points $(t_i, z_i = \\ln(y_i))$ are:\n- $t_1 = 0$, $z_1 = \\ln(0.3)$\n- $t_2 = 0.5$, $z_2 = \\ln(0.45)$\n- $t_3 = 1.0$, $z_3 = \\ln(0.68)$\n\nWe compute the sums for the regression on $(t_i, z_i)$:\n$$ \\sum t_i = 1.5 $$\n$$ \\sum t_i^2 = 1.25 $$\n$$ \\sum z_i = \\ln(0.3) + \\ln(0.45) + \\ln(0.68) \\approx -1.20397 - 0.79851 - 0.38566 = -2.38814 $$\n$$ \\sum t_i z_i = (0)\\ln(0.3) + (0.5)\\ln(0.45) + (1.0)\\ln(0.68) \\approx 0 + (0.5)(-0.79851) + (1.0)(-0.38566) = -0.399255 - 0.38566 = -0.784915 $$\n\nUsing the same least squares formula for the slope, we find $k$:\n$$ k = \\frac{n \\left(\\sum t_i z_i\\right) - \\left(\\sum t_i\\right) \\left(\\sum z_i\\right)}{n \\left(\\sum t_i^2\\right) - \\left(\\sum t_i\\right)^2} \\approx \\frac{3(-0.784915) - (1.5)(-2.38814)}{3(1.25) - (1.5)^2} $$\n$$ k \\approx \\frac{-2.354745 + 3.58221}{3.75 - 2.25} = \\frac{1.227465}{1.5} \\approx 0.81831 \\text{ year}^{-1} $$\nThe PSA doubling time, $T_d$, is the time it takes for the PSA value to double. We solve for $T_d$ in the equation $y(t+T_d) = 2y(t)$:\n$$ y_0 \\exp(k(t+T_d)) = 2 y_0 \\exp(kt) $$\n$$ \\exp(kt)\\exp(kT_d) = 2 \\exp(kt) $$\n$$ \\exp(kT_d) = 2 $$\n$$ kT_d = \\ln(2) $$\n$$ T_d = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k} $$\nSubstituting the calculated value of $k$:\n$$ T_d \\approx \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.81831} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{0.81831} \\approx 0.84705 \\text{ years} $$\nThe problem asks for the doubling time in months. We convert years to months:\n$$ T_d \\approx 0.84705 \\text{ years} \\times 12 \\frac{\\text{months}}{\\text{year}} \\approx 10.1646 \\text{ months} $$\nRounded to three significant figures, the PSA doubling time is $10.2$ months.\n\n**3. Clinical Interpretation**\n\nBiochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy is widely defined as a PSA level rising to $0.2$ ng/mL or higher, with a second confirmatory value also at or above $0.2$ ng/mL. This patient's PSA values of $0.3$, $0.45$, and $0.68$ ng/mL clearly establish that he has BCR.\n\nThe computed kinetic parameters help to stratify the risk of clinical progression (e.g., development of metastases).\n- **PSA Velocity (PSAV)**: The calculated PSAV is $0.380$ ng/mL per year. While less emphasized than doubling time in modern guidelines, a PSAV greater than $0.35$ ng/mL/year is considered by some to be a risk factor for more aggressive disease. This value is concerning.\n- **PSA Doubling Time (PSADT)**: The PSADT of $10.2$ months is a more robust prognostic indicator. A shorter PSADT is strongly correlated with a higher risk of metastasis and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Clinical practice guidelines often use the following approximate risk categories for PSADT:\n    - Low risk: PSADT $ 15$ months\n    - Intermediate risk: PSADT $9 - 15$ months\n    - High risk: PSADT $ 9$ months (with some defining very high risk as $ 3$ months)\nThis patient's PSADT of $10.2$ months places him in an intermediate-to-high-risk category. This suggests a significant likelihood of disease progression and warrants close monitoring and a discussion regarding the potential benefits and risks of salvage therapy, such as radiation therapy to the prostatic fossa.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.380  10.2 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4889922"}, {"introduction": "In the realm of advanced or metastatic prostate cancer, treatment selection becomes a nuanced exercise in balancing efficacy with patient-specific factors.

The question is well-posed, objective, and requires the application of these principles to the specific patient- and disease-related factors to arrive at a logical conclusion. The problem is not trivial, as it involves a nuanced decision balancing the efficacy of different systemic therapies against their toxicity profiles in the context of significant patient comorbidities. There are no identifiable flaws violating the criteria for a valid problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A formal solution and option-by-option analysis may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe solution requires a systematic, principle-based approach to selecting the initial therapy for this patient with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).\n\n1.  **Assess Disease Risk and Volume:**\n    The patient presents with high-risk features: a Gleason score of $9$ and a PSA of $120$ $\\mathrm{ng/mL}$. We must formally assess the disease volume using the provided CHAARTED criteria: `visceral metastases or $\\geq 4$ bone lesions with at least 1 beyond the axial skeleton`.\n    -   Visceral metastases: The patient has none.\n    -   Bone lesions: The patient has $5$ bone lesions, which satisfies the condition of $\\geq 4$. The lesions include $2$ in the ribs. For the purpose of the CHAARTED criteria, the \"axial skeleton\" is defined as the vertebral column and pelvis. Therefore, rib lesions are considered \"beyond the axial skeleton\". Since the patient has at least $1$ such lesion, he meets the criteria for **high-volume disease**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Overall Treatment Strategy:**\n    The provided principles state that for mHSPC, treatment intensification with a combination therapy provides an overall survival benefit compared to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone. Given the patient's high-volume disease and good functional status (ECOG $1$), he is a clear candidate for intensified therapy. ADT monotherapy would be considered a suboptimal approach. This eliminates options that suggest ADT alone.\n\n3.  **Select the Intensification Agent:**\n    The primary options for intensification in this setting are ADT plus docetaxel (chemotherapy) or ADT plus a novel hormonal agent/androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI), such as abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. The selection must balance efficacy with the patient's specific comorbidity profile, as stated in the third principle.\n\n    -   **Patient-Specific Factors:** The patient has two critical comorbidities that directly influence the choice of agent:\n        a.  **Poorly controlled Type $2$ Diabetes Mellitus (HbA1c $9.0\\%$):** This makes him highly susceptible to the hyperglycemic effects of corticosteroids.\n        b.  **Grade $2$ (moderate) painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy:** This is a pre-existing, symptomatic condition that could be severely exacerbated by neurotoxic agents.\n\n    -   **Analysis of Potential Regimens:**\n        -   **ADT + Docetaxel:** Docetaxel is a highly effective agent for high-volume mHSPC. However, its toxicity profile includes significant, dose-limiting peripheral neuropathy. Administering docetaxel to a patient with pre-existing grade $2$ neuropathy carries a very high risk of worsening the neuropathy to a severe and functionally debilitating level (grade $3$ or $4$), which would directly oppose the patient's wish to `minimize treatment-related functional decline`. Furthermore, docetaxel requires premedication with corticosteroids (typically dexamethasone), which would further destabilize his already poorly controlled diabetes. Therefore, this regimen is a poor choice.\n\n        -   **ADT + Abiraterone Acetate with Prednisone:** Abiraterone is also a highly effective agent. However, its administration requires co-administration of prednisone (typically $5$ mg daily or twice daily). While this is a lower dose than used with chemotherapy, chronic daily steroid use will predictably worsen glycemic control in a patient with an HbA1c of $9.0\\%$, making diabetes management more challenging. This represents a significant, though potentially manageable, drawback.\n\n        -   **ADT + Enzalutamide:** Enzalutamide is an ARPI with proven efficacy in mHSPC, showing an overall survival benefit. Crucially, its toxicity profile does not include significant peripheral neuropathy. Most importantly, **it does not require co-administration of corticosteroids**. It therefore avoids the two most significant risks posed by the other options for this specific patient: worsening of neuropathy and steroid-induced hyperglycemia. While enzalutamide has its own side effects (e.g., fatigue, hypertension), these do not directly overlap with the patient's most vulnerable areas.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on a rigorous balancing of efficacy and toxicity, ADT plus enzalutamide represents the most appropriate regimen. It provides the required survival benefit of an intensified therapy while posing the least risk of exacerbating the patient's specific, significant comorbidities of peripheral neuropathy and poorly controlled diabetes. This choice aligns with the principle of personalizing therapy and with the patient's desire to maintain function.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Initiate Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) plus docetaxel chemotherapy, because high-volume disease predicts maximal benefit from chemotherapy and diabetes is unlikely to be a meaningful barrier.**\nThis option correctly notes the efficacy of docetaxel in high-volume disease. However, its rationale is critically flawed. The assertion that `diabetes is unlikely to be a meaningful barrier` is false; the required corticosteroid premedication would significantly complicate management of a patient with an HbA1c of $9.0\\%$. More critically, the option completely ignores the patient's pre-existing grade $2$ peripheral neuropathy, which is a strong relative contraindication to the neurotoxic agent docetaxel.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Initiate Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) plus enzalutamide, because the patient meets high-volume criteria but has comorbidities (poorly controlled diabetes and grade $2$ neuropathy) that increase the risk or burden of chemotherapy and corticosteroid premedication, favoring an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor without chronic steroid use.**\nThis option presents a complete and accurate analysis. It correctly identifies the patient as having high-volume disease warranting intensification. It correctly identifies the `poorly controlled diabetes` and `grade 2 neuropathy` as key factors arguing against chemotherapy (docetaxel). It correctly concludes that an ARPI that does not require steroids, such as enzalutamide, is the most suitable choice to balance efficacy and safety in this specific clinical context.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Initiate Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) alone and defer treatment intensification until biochemical progression or castration resistance develops, because ADT remains the foundational therapy and intensification can be reserved.**\nThis option represents an outdated standard of care. For a patient with high-volume mHSPC and a good performance status, numerous high-level clinical trials have demonstrated a substantial overall survival benefit for upfront intensification compared to ADT alone. Deferring intensification would deny the patient this proven benefit. This violates the second principle provided in the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Initiate Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) plus abiraterone acetate with prednisone, because abiraterone is an effective option and prednisone will not meaningfully affect glycemic control in this context.**\nThis option correctly recognizes abiraterone as an effective agent. However, it makes a clinically unsound claim that `prednisone will not meaningfully affect glycemic control`. In a patient with an HbA1c of $9.0\\%$, indicating very poor baseline control, the addition of any daily corticosteroid, even low-dose prednisone, is a meaningful clinical challenge that will almost certainly worsen hyperglycemia. While abiraterone/prednisone is a possible option, it is inferior to a non-steroid-requiring regimen like enzalutamide in this specific patient.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4889877"}]}
