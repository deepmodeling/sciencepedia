A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem defines dose intensity, which we denote as $DI$, as the amount of drug normalized to body surface area delivered per unit time. This is a rate calculation. The formula for dose intensity is:\n$$ DI = \\frac{\\text{Dose per cycle}}{\\text{Time interval per cycle}} = \\frac{D}{T} $$\nThe given per-cycle dose, normalized to body surface area, is $D = 60 \\, \\mathrm{mg/m^2}$. The problem asks for the dose intensity to be expressed in units of $\\mathrm{mg/m^2/week}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the dose intensity for the standard, every-$3$-weeks schedule. Let this be $DI_1$. The time interval for this schedule is $T_1 = 3 \\, \\mathrm{weeks}$.\nUsing the formula for dose intensity:\n$$ DI_1 = \\frac{D}{T_1} = \\frac{60 \\, \\mathrm{mg/m^2}}{3 \\, \\mathrm{weeks}} $$\n$$ DI_1 = 20 \\, \\mathrm{mg/m^2/week} $$\n\nSecond, we compute the dose intensity for the dose-dense, every-$2$-weeks schedule. Let this be $DI_2$. The time interval for this schedule is $T_2 = 2 \\, \\mathrm{weeks}$.\nUsing the same formula:\n$$ DI_2 = \\frac{D}{T_2} = \\frac{60 \\, \\mathrm{mg/m^2}}{2 \\, \\mathrm{weeks}} $$\n$$ DI_2 = 30 \\, \\mathrm{mg/m^2/week} $$\n\nThird, we compute the ratio of the dose-dense intensity to the standard intensity. Let this ratio be $R$.\n$$ R = \\frac{DI_2}{DI_1} = \\frac{30 \\, \\mathrm{mg/m^2/week}}{20 \\, \\mathrm{mg/m^2/week}} $$\nThe units cancel out, leaving a dimensionless quantity:\n$$ R = \\frac{30}{20} = \\frac{3}{2} $$\nAs a check, we can compute the ratio symbolically. Since the dose per cycle $D$ is the same for both schedules, the ratio of intensities is inversely proportional to the ratio of the cycle times:\n$$ R = \\fracDI_2}{DI_1} = \\frac{D/T_2}{D/T_1} = \\frac{D}{T_2} \\cdot \\frac{T_1}{D} = \\frac{T_1}{T_2} $$\nSubstituting the given time intervals:\n$$ R = \\frac{3 \\, \\mathrm{weeks}}{2 \\, \\mathrm{weeks}} = \\frac{3}{2} $$\nThis confirms the numerical calculation. The problem requires exact values, and $\\frac{3}{2}$ is an exact representation.\n\nThe three requested values, in order, are:\n1.

Multiplying both sides by the denominator gives the general dosing formula:\n$$Dose \\approx AUC \\times (GFR + 25 \\, \\mathrm{mL/min})$$\nThis relationship is known in clinical practice as the Calvert formula for carboplatin dosing.\n\n### Dose Calculation\nThe next step is to compute the specific dose for the given values:\n- Target $AUC = 5 \\, \\mathrm{mg \\cdot min/mL}$\n- $GFR = 60 \\, \\mathrm{mL/min}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived dosing formula:\n$$Dose = (5 \\, \\mathrm{mg \\cdot min/mL}) \\times (60 \\, \\mathrm{mL/min} + 25 \\, \\mathrm{mL/min})$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total clearance term in the parentheses:\n$$60 \\, \\mathrm{mL/min} + 25 \\, \\mathrm{mL/min} = 85 \\, \\mathrm{mL/min}$$\n\nNow, we multiply by the target $AUC$:\n$$Dose = 5 \\, \\mathrm{mg \\cdot min/mL} \\times 85 \\, \\mathrm{mL/min}$$\n$$Dose = 425 \\, \\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
