The patient’s biochemical iron indices are collected in each scenario. Transferrin saturation (TSAT) is defined as the fraction of transferrin iron-binding sites occupied by iron. When serum iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) are measured in the same mass concentration units, the fraction can be computed using their ratio. Use this definition to compute TSAT as a decimal. Then, reason from foundational clinical facts about iron physiology and the acute-phase response to classify iron status in each scenario.\n\nScenario without active inflammation:\n- Serum iron: $35$ $\\mu\\text{g}/\\text{dL}$\n- Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC): $460$ $\\mu\\text{g}/\\text{dL}$\n- Ferritin: $12$ $\\text{ng}/\\text{mL}$\n- C-reactive protein (CRP): $0.2$ $\\text{mg}/\\text{dL}$\n- Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR): $4.8$ $\\text{mg}/\\text{L}$\n\nScenario with active inflammation:\n- Serum iron: $28$ $\\mu\\text{g}/\\text{dL}$\n- Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC): $240$ $\\mu\\text{g}/\\text{dL}$\n- Ferritin: $500$ $\\text{ng}/\\text{mL}$\n- C-reactive protein (CRP): $8$ $\\text{mg}/\\text{dL}$\n- Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR): $1.7$ $\\text{mg}/\\text{L}$\n\nTasks:\n1.

Using well-tested facts about iron homeostasis and inflammation (including the roles of ferritin as an acute-phase reactant, the effect of inflammation on transferrin as a negative acute-phase reactant that lowers TIBC, and the behavior of soluble transferrin receptor in absolute versus functional iron deficiency), classify the iron status in each scenario as absolute iron deficiency, functional iron deficiency due to inflammation (anemia of chronic disease), or iron sufficiency.\n3.
