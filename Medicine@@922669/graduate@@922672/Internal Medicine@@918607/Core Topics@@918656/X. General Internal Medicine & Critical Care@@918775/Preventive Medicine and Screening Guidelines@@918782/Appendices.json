Mastering this conversion is essential for communicating the potential impact of a preventive intervention in a way that is both accurate and meaningful.", "problem": "A clinician is applying guidance from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) for cardiovascular prevention. For a patient with an estimated $10$-year baseline probability of a major atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event of $12\\%$, the clinician is considering a preventive intervention whose effect has been consistently reported in randomized trials as a constant relative risk reduction of $25\\%$ for the composite outcome over the same $10$-year horizon.\n\nStarting from first principles in clinical epidemiology, use the following foundational definitions:\n- Absolute risk (probability) of an outcome over a specified time horizon is the long-run frequency limit for that outcome in a population, denoted by $p$.\n- Relative risk $RR$ is the ratio of the treated event probability to the untreated event probability over the same time horizon.\n- Relative risk reduction $RRR$ is defined as $RRR = 1 - RR$.\n- Absolute risk reduction $ARR$ is defined as the difference between untreated and treated event probabilities over the same time horizon, $ARR = p_{\\text{untreated}} - p_{\\text{treated}}$.\n- Number needed to treat $NNT$ over a specified time horizon is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction over that horizon, $NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$.\n\nAssume the intervention’s relative effect is multiplicative and constant across baseline risk strata, and that the $RRR$ applies to the same composite endpoint used to estimate the baseline risk. Derive the expected $ARR$ from the given $RRR$ and baseline risk, and then compute the corresponding $NNT$ over $10$ years.\n\nExpress the $ARR$ as a decimal proportion (not with a percentage sign).

It presents a standard, albeit fundamental, calculation in clinical epidemiology and evidence-based medicine. All necessary definitions and data are provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the absolute risk reduction ($ARR$) and the number needed to treat ($NNT$) from a given baseline risk and relative risk reduction ($RRR$). We begin by formally stating the provided information and definitions.\n\nThe given quantities are:\n- The baseline probability of the event for an untreated patient, $p_{\\text{untreated}} = 12\\% = 0.12$.\n- The relative risk reduction associated with the intervention, $RRR = 25\\% = 0.25$.\n\nThe foundational definitions provided are:\n1.

Substituting $(1 - RR)$ with $RRR$ in the equation for $ARR$ gives the final derived relationship:\n$$ARR = p_{\\text{untreated}} \\times RRR$$\nThis relationship is a cornerstone of quantitative clinical decision-making, as it directly connects the relative effect of an intervention ($RRR$), which is often constant across different populations, to the absolute effect ($ARR$), which depends on the patient's baseline risk ($p_{\\text{untreated}}$).\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values into this derived formula to calculate the $ARR$ for this specific patient over the $10$-year horizon.\n$$ARR = 0.12 \\times 0.25 = 0.03$$\nThe problem requires the result to be expressed as a decimal proportion with four significant figures. The first significant figure is the $3$. To represent this value with four significant figures, we must append trailing zeros.\n$$ARR = 0.03000$$\nHaving calculated the $ARR$, we can now compute the $NNT$ using its definition:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nSubstituting the calculated value of $ARR$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.03} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{100}} = \\frac{100}{3} = 33.333\\overline{3}$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $3$, $3$, $3$, and $3$. The fifth significant digit is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$NNT \\approx 33.33$$\nThus, the expected absolute risk reduction is $0.03000$, and the number needed to treat over $10$ years to prevent one additional event is approximately $33.33$.
