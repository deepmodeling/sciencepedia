This practice challenges you to move beyond simple formulaic calculations by integrating two critical nuances: selecting the appropriate body weight in an older adult with obesity and, most importantly, distinguishing a true decline in kidney function from a misleading laboratory artifact caused by a common drug interaction. Mastering this integrated analysis [@problem_id:4839436] is essential for preventing both underdosing and toxicity in complex older patients.", "problem": "An older adult with multimorbidity presents for antibiotic dosing in the setting of multiple concurrent medications. A female patient aged $82$ years has height $160$ cm and actual body weight $78$ kg. Three days after initiation of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, her measured Serum Creatinine (SCr) is $1.3$ mg/dL; her pre–trimethoprim baseline SCr was $1.1$ mg/dL, and a Cystatin C–based estimated glomerular filtration rate is stable. You must select an appropriate body weight for creatinine clearance estimation in an obese older adult, account for drug-induced changes in creatinine handling, and then adjust the dose of a renally cleared agent.\n\nUsing the Cockcroft–Gault approach to approximate creatinine clearance, justify the choice of body weight and the SCr value from first principles of geriatric pharmacology and polypharmacy management, then compute the creatinine clearance $CrCl$ and choose the maintenance dose for a hypothetical renally cleared antibiotic (Renaxabac) with the following dosing cutoff: if $CrCl \\ge 35$ mL/min, maintain at $500$ mg every $24$ hours; if $CrCl < 35$ mL/min, reduce to $250$ mg every $24$ hours. Round your computed creatinine clearance to three significant figures. Express the final maintenance dose in milligrams and round to three significant figures.

It requires the application of standard clinical formulas and reasoning, specifically addressing polypharmacy and age-related physiological changes.\n\nThe solution requires a stepwise approach: first, determining the appropriate body weight for the creatinine clearance calculation; second, selecting the correct serum creatinine value based on pharmacodynamic principles; third, calculating the creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault equation; and finally, choosing the drug dose based on the calculated clearance.\n\n**Step 1: Justification and Selection of Body Weight**\n\nThe Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equation uses weight as a surrogate for muscle mass, which is the primary source of creatinine production. The patient's actual body weight (ABW) is $78$ kg. To determine if this patient is obese and whether an adjusted body weight should be used, we first calculate her ideal body weight (IBW). The Devine formula is a standard method for this calculation.\n\nThe patient's height is $160$ cm. We convert this to inches:\n$$ 160 \\text{ cm} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ inch}}{2.54 \\text{ cm}} \\approx 62.99 \\text{ inches} $$\nThis height is equivalent to $5$ feet and $2.99$ inches.\n\nFor a female, the IBW is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{IBW (kg)} = 45.5 + 2.3 \\times (\\text{Height in inches} - 60) $$\n$$ \\text{IBW} = 45.5 + 2.3 \\times (62.99 - 60) = 45.5 + 2.3 \\times 2.99 = 45.5 + 6.877 = 52.377 \\text{ kg} $$\n\nNext, we compare the patient's ABW to her IBW to assess for obesity. A common threshold is an ABW that is $120\\%$ (or a factor of $1.2$) of the IBW.\n$$ \\frac{\\text{ABW}}{\\text{IBW}} = \\frac{78 \\text{ kg}}{52.377 \\text{ kg}} \\approx 1.489 $$\nSince the patient's ABW is approximately $149\\%$ of her IBW, she is considered obese. In obese individuals, using ABW in the CG equation can overestimate creatinine clearance because adipose tissue contributes less to creatinine production than lean body mass. Conversely, using IBW can lead to an underestimation. Therefore, an adjusted body weight (AdjBW) is the most appropriate parameter. The standard formula for AdjBW is:\n$$ \\text{AdjBW} = \\text{IBW} + 0.4 \\times (\\text{ABW} - \\text{IBW}) $$\n$$ \\text{AdjBW} = 52.377 + 0.4 \\times (78 - 52.377) = 52.377 + 0.4 \\times (25.623) = 52.377 + 10.2492 = 62.6262 \\text{ kg} $$\nThis value, AdjBW $\\approx 62.6$ kg, will be used for the weight parameter in the CG equation.\n\n**Step 2: Justification and Selection of Serum Creatinine (SCr)**\n\nThe patient's serum creatinine increased from a baseline of $1.1$ mg/dL to $1.3$ mg/dL after the initiation of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole. Trimethoprim is known to be a competitive inhibitor of the organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) in the proximal tubules of the kidney. This transporter is responsible for the tubular secretion of creatinine, which accounts for approximately $10-20\\%$ of total creatinine clearance. By blocking this secretion pathway, trimethoprim causes an increase in serum creatinine concentration that does not reflect a true decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).\n\nThis interpretation is critically supported by the problem statement that \"a Cystatin C–based estimated glomerular filtration rate is stable.\" Cystatin C is a protein filtered by the glomerulus and is not subject to tubular secretion; therefore, its level is not affected by trimethoprim. The stable Cystatin C-based eGFR confirms that the patient's true renal filtration function has not declined. The observed rise in SCr is a pharmacological artifact, a form of pseudo-nephrotoxicity.\n\nTo accurately estimate the patient's underlying renal function for dosing other renally cleared drugs, one must use the serum creatinine value that reflects the true GFR. Using the elevated value of $1.3$ mg/dL would lead to an underestimation of creatinine clearance and potential underdosing. Therefore, the baseline SCr of $1.1$ mg/dL is the correct value to use in the CG equation.\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of Creatinine Clearance (CrCl)**\n\nThe Cockcroft-Gault equation for estimating CrCl is:\n$$ \\text{CrCl} (\\text{mL/min}) = \\frac{(140 - \\text{Age}) \\times \\text{Weight (kg)}}{\\text{SCr (mg/dL)} \\times 72} $$\nFor female patients, the result is multiplied by a correction factor of $0.85$.\n\nUsing the justified parameters:\n- Age = $82$ years\n- Weight = AdjBW = $62.6262$ kg\n- SCr = $1.1$ mg/dL\n- Sex = Female (factor of $0.85$)\n\n$$ \\text{CrCl} = \\frac{(140 - 82) \\times 62.6262}{1.1 \\times 72} \\times 0.85 $$\n$$ \\text{CrCl} = \\frac{58 \\times 62.6262}{79.2} \\times 0.85 $$\n$$ \\text{CrCl} = \\frac{3632.3196}{79.2} \\times 0.85 $$\n$$ \\text{CrCl} = 45.8626 \\times 0.85 $$\n$$ \\text{CrCl} \\approx 38.9832 \\text{ mL/min} $$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as required:\n$$ \\text{CrCl} = 39.0 \\text{ mL/min} $$\n\n**Step 4: Selection of Maintenance Dose for Renaxabac**\n\nThe dosing guidelines for the hypothetical antibiotic Renaxabac are based on the calculated CrCl:\n- If $CrCl \\ge 35$ mL/min, maintain at $500$ mg every $24$ hours.\n- If $CrCl < 35$ mL/min, reduce to $250$ mg every $24$ hours.\n\nOur calculated CrCl is $39.0$ mL/min. Since $39.0 \\text{ mL/min} \\ge 35 \\text{ mL/min}$, the appropriate maintenance dose is $500$ mg every $24$ hours. The problem asks for the dose in milligrams rounded to three significant figures, which is $500$ mg.\n\nThe final answer consists of the calculated creatinine clearance and the selected maintenance dose.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pmatrix{39.0 & 500}}\n$$", "id": "4839436"}, {"introduction": "Polypharmacy frequently leads to drug-drug interactions that alter medication clearance, increasing the risk of adverse events.

The problem explicitly states that the ICH rate on apixaban ($I_{\\mathrm{ICH},\\mathrm{tx}} = 0.50$) is predicated on the discontinuation of aspirin and minimization of NSAIDs. This act of polypharmacy mitigation is essential to achieving the positive net clinical benefit calculated. Without this medication management, the true $I_{\\mathrm{ICH},\\mathrm{tx}}$ would be higher, potentially reducing or even negating the NCB.
