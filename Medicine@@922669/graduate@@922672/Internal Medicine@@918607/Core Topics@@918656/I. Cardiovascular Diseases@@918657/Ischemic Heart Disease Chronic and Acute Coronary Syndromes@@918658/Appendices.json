The task is to validate the problem, derive the formula for FFR from first principles as described, calculate its value, and comment on its clinical significance.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Proximal aortic pressure during hyperemia: $P_{a} = 95$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n- Distal coronary pressure beyond stenosis during hyperemia: $P_{d} = 70$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n- Right atrial pressure, $P_{ra}$, is assumed negligible.\n- Hemodynamic relation: Coronary flow $Q$ is proportional to the perfusion pressure gradient divided by microvascular resistance.\n- Definition of FFR: Ratio of maximal achievable flow with the stenosis ($Q_{S}$) to the maximal achievable flow without the stenosis ($Q_{N}$) during hyperemia, i.e., $FFR = \\frac{Q_S}{Q_N}$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on established principles of cardiovascular fluid dynamics and invasive coronary physiology. The definition of FFR, the pressures provided, and the hemodynamic relationship are all standard and factually correct within this domain.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary data and definitions to arrive at a unique solution. The assumption to neglect right atrial pressure is a standard and valid simplification used in the derivation of FFR.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective, and quantitative language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem that can be solved using the provided information. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the relationship between FFR and the measured pressures, starting from the principle that flow is proportional to the perfusion pressure gradient divided by resistance.\n\nLet $Q$ represent the coronary blood flow, $\\Delta P$ represent the perfusion pressure gradient, and $R_{micro}$ represent the resistance of the coronary microvasculature. The given relationship is:\n$$ Q \\propto \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_{micro}} $$\nThis can be written as an equation with a constant of proportionality $k$:\n$$ Q = k \\frac{\\Delta P}{R_{micro}} $$\nFor simplicity and without loss of generality, we can set $k=1$, as it will cancel out in the final ratio.\n\nThe perfusion pressure gradient ($\\Delta P$) is the difference between the pressure driving flow into the coronary vascular bed and the pressure at which the blood exits the bed (the right atrial pressure, $P_{ra}$). The problem states that $P_{ra}$ can be considered negligible, i.e., $P_{ra} \\approx 0$.\n\nLet $Q_S$ be the maximal flow through the stenotic artery during hyperemia. In this state, the pressure driving flow through the microvasculature is the distal coronary pressure, $P_d$. Therefore, the perfusion pressure gradient is $P_d - P_{ra}$. The flow is:\n$$ Q_S = \\frac{P_d - P_{ra}}{R_{micro}} $$\nWith the assumption $P_{ra} \\approx 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ Q_S = \\frac{P_d}{R_{micro}} $$\n\nNow, consider $Q_N$, the hypothetical maximal flow in the same artery if the stenosis were absent, also during hyperemia. In this normal, non-stenotic scenario, there would be no pressure drop across the epicardial segment. Thus, the pressure at the same distal point would be equal to the proximal aortic pressure, $P_a$. The perfusion pressure gradient for the microvasculature would be $P_a - P_{ra}$. The flow is:\n$$ Q_N = \\frac{P_a - P_{ra}}{R_{micro}} $$\nAgain, with the assumption $P_{ra} \\approx 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ Q_N = \\frac{P_a}{R_{micro}} $$\nA key assumption in FFR measurement is that the state of maximal hyperemia (induced by a pharmacologic agent) ensures that the microvascular resistance, $R_{micro}$, is at its minimal and constant value, and is independent of the presence of an epicardial stenosis.\n\nThe definition of FFR is the ratio of these two flows:\n$$ FFR = \\frac{Q_S}{Q_N} $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $Q_S$ and $Q_N$:\n$$ FFR = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{P_d}{R_{micro}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{P_a}{R_{micro}}\\right)} $$\nThe term for microvascular resistance, $R_{micro}$, cancels out from the numerator and denominator. This shows that FFR is independent of microvascular resistance, a fundamental advantage of the measurement. The final derived relationship is:\n$$ FFR = \\frac{P_d}{P_a} $$\nThis expression shows that, under conditions of maximal hyperemia and negligible right atrial pressure, the FFR is simply the ratio of the distal coronary pressure to the proximal aortic pressure.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the given patient data:\n- $P_a = 95$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $P_d = 70$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n\n$$ FFR = \\frac{70}{95} \\approx 0.736842... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ FFR \\approx 0.737 $$\n\nFinally, we consider the clinical implication. In patients with stable ischemic heart disease, a hemodynamically significant stenosis is typically defined by an FFR value less than or equal to $0.80$. Stenoses with $FFR \\le 0.80$ are associated with demonstrable ischemia and have been shown to benefit from revascularization (e.g., percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting).
