Monotonicity demands $0$, $1$, and $2$ points, respectively, aligning higher clinical suspicion with higher risk.\n- ECG: ischemic burden increases from normal to nonspecific repolarization abnormalities to significant ST-segment deviation; scoring must reflect $0$, $1$, and $2$ in that increasing order.\n- Age: cardiovascular risk accrues with age; epidemiologically justified cut points in the HEART score are $45$ years $=0$, $45$–$64$ years $=1$, and $\\geq 65$ years $=2$.\n- Risk factors: traditional factors include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, obesity, positive family history, and known atherosclerotic disease.
