With tachycardia (increased heart rate), the diastolic filling period shortens disproportionately. To move the same stroke volume across the fixed stenotic mitral valve in a much shorter time, the flow velocity must increase dramatically. Since the pressure gradient is proportional to the square of the velocity, the gradient experiences an even more pronounced rise. The final mean gradient of approximately $32.5$ mm Hg is extremely high and would elevate the left atrial and pulmonary capillary pressures well above the threshold for pulmonary edema (typically around $25$ mm Hg).
