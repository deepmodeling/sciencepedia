A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to compute the Net Clinical Benefit (NCB), which is defined as the number of ischemic stroke events prevented minus the number of major bleeding events caused, per $100$ patient-years.\n\nLet $N_{SP}$ denote the number of ischemic stroke events prevented per $100$ patient-years. This quantity is the absolute risk reduction (ARR) for stroke.\nLet $s_0$ be the baseline stroke incidence and $s_1$ be the on-treatment stroke incidence. According to the provided definitions:\n$$s_1 = s_0 \\times r_s$$\n$$N_{SP} = s_0 - s_1$$\nSubstituting the first equation into the second yields:\n$$N_{SP} = s_0 - (s_0 \\times r_s) = s_0 (1 - r_s)$$\nUsing the given values, $s_0 = 4.8$ and $r_s = 0.35$:\n$$N_{SP} = 4.8 \\times (1 - 0.35) = 4.8 \\times 0.65 = 3.12$$\nThus, $3.12$ ischemic stroke events are prevented per $100$ patient-years.\n\nLet $N_{BC}$ denote the number of major bleeding events caused per $100$ patient-years. This is the absolute risk increase (ARI) for major bleeding, which is the on-treatment risk minus the baseline risk.\nLet $b_0$ be the baseline major bleeding incidence and $b_1$ be the on-treatment major bleeding incidence. According to definition (i):\n$$b_1 = b_0 \\times r_b$$\nThe number of bleeding events caused is the difference between the on-treatment incidence and the baseline incidence:\n$$N_{BC} = b_1 - b_0$$\nSubstituting the first equation into the second yields:\n$$N_{BC} = (b_0 \\times r_b) - b_0 = b_0 (r_b - 1)$$\nUsing the given values, $b_0 = 1.2$ and $r_b = 1.30$:\n$$N_{BC} = 1.2 \\times (1.30 - 1) = 1.2 \\times 0.30 = 0.36$$\nThus, $0.36$ excess major bleeding events are caused per $100$ patient-years.\n\nThe Net Clinical Benefit (NCB) is defined as:\n$$NCB = N_{SP} - N_{BC}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$NCB = 3.12 - 0.36 = 2.76$$\nThe result, $2.76$, is already presented with three significant figures, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe sign of the NCB is positive ($2.76 > 0$), which indicates that the number of ischemic strokes prevented by the therapy exceeds the number of major bleeds caused by the therapy over a one-year horizon.
