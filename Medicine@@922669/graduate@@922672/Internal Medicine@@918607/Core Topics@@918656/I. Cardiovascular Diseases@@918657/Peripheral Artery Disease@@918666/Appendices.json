While we know that atherosclerotic plaques narrow arteries, the relationship between the degree of narrowing and the resulting reduction in blood flow is profoundly non-linear. This exercise [@problem_id:4884222] challenges you to apply the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, a cornerstone of fluid dynamics, to a simplified model of an arterial stenosis. By deriving the change in flow from a given reduction in diameter, you will uncover the powerful fourth-power dependence of flow on vessel radius, providing a crucial physical explanation for why anatomically moderate stenoses can cause severe physiological ischemia.", "problem": "A $65$-year-old individual with intermittent claudication due to peripheral artery disease is modeled hemodynamically by a single, rigid, cylindrical arterial segment of length $L$ that is responsible for the dominant pressure drop across the limb circulation at rest. Blood is approximated as an incompressible Newtonian fluid with dynamic viscosity $\\eta$, and flow is steady and laminar. Assume the axial pressure drop $\\Delta P$ across this segment remains constant before and after development of a focal, uniform atherosclerotic narrowing.

This is clarified as the post-stenosis diameter being $0.5$ times the pre-stenosis diameter.\n-   The goal is to derive the fractional flow ratio $f \\equiv \\frac{Q_{\\text{stenosis}}}{Q_{\\text{normal}}}$.\n-   The starting point is the Hagen–Poiseuille relation.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on the Hagen–Poiseuille equation, a fundamental principle of fluid dynamics for laminar flow in a rigid tube. While blood is a non-Newtonian fluid and arteries are compliant, modeling blood as Newtonian and vessels as rigid are common and valid first-order approximations in hemodynamics, especially for educational problems. The context of peripheral artery disease is medically and scientifically relevant.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear objective ($f$), a starting equation (Hagen-Poiseuille), and all necessary conditions (constant $\\Delta P$, $L$, $\\eta$; specified diameter reduction) to find a unique, well-defined solution.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms. The phrase \"$50\\%$ diameter reduction\" is explicitly defined, removing ambiguity.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. The assumptions (steady, laminar flow; rigid tube; constant $\\Delta P$) are explicitly stated and create a consistent physical model, even if simplified. There are no missing or contradictory data.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded (within its stated modeling assumptions), well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying the Hagen-Poiseuille relation to the arterial segment before and after the development of stenosis. The Hagen–Poiseuille equation for volumetric flow rate $Q$ through a cylindrical tube of radius $r$ and length $L$, driven by a pressure drop $\\Delta P$, for a fluid with dynamic viscosity $\\eta$, is given by:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\pi (\\Delta P) r^4}{8 \\eta L}\n$$\nThis relation is valid under the assumptions of steady, laminar, incompressible, and Newtonian flow, all of which are stated in the problem.\n\nLet $Q_{\\text{normal}}$ be the volumetric flow rate in the healthy artery with radius $r_{0}$. Applying the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, we have:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{normal}} = \\frac{\\pi (\\Delta P) r_{0}^4}{8 \\eta L}\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta P$, $\\eta$, and $L$ are the pressure drop, viscosity, and segment length, respectively.\n\nAfter the development of a focal stenosis, the radius is reduced to $r_{1}$. The problem states that the length of the flow-limiting segment $L$ and the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ across it remain constant. The viscosity $\\eta$ of the blood is also unchanged. The volumetric flow rate in the stenotic artery, $Q_{\\text{stenosis}}$, is therefore:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{stenosis}} = \\frac{\\pi (\\Delta P) r_{1}^4}{8 \\eta L}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the fractional flow ratio, $f$, defined as the ratio of the stenotic flow to the normal flow:\n$$\nf \\equiv \\frac{Q_{\\text{stenosis}}}{Q_{\\text{normal}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $Q_{\\text{stenosis}}$ and $Q_{\\text{normal}}$ into this definition yields:\n$$\nf = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi (\\Delta P) r_{1}^4}{8 \\eta L}}{\\frac{\\pi (\\Delta P) r_{0}^4}{8 \\eta L}}\n$$\nThe common factors $\\pi$, $\\Delta P$, $8$, $\\eta$, and $L$ cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n$$\nf = \\frac{r_{1}^4}{r_{0}^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_0}\\right)^4\n$$\nThe final step is to determine the ratio of the radii, $\\frac{r_1}{r_0}$. The problem states that the stenosis produces a \"$50\\%$ diameter reduction\". Let the pre-stenosis diameter be $d_0$ and the post-stenosis diameter be $d_1$. A $50\\%$ reduction means the new diameter $d_1$ is $50\\%$ of the original diameter $d_0$.\n$$\nd_1 = (1 - 0.50) d_0 = 0.5 d_0 = \\frac{1}{2} d_0\n$$\nSince the diameter $d$ of a cylinder is twice its radius $r$ (i.e., $d = 2r$), we can relate the radii:\n$$\nd_0 = 2 r_0\n$$\n$$\nd_1 = 2 r_1\n$$\nSubstituting these into the diameter relationship:\n$$\n2 r_1 = \\frac{1}{2} (2 r_0)\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nr_1 = \\frac{1}{2} r_0\n$$\nTherefore, the ratio of the radii is:\n$$\n\\frac{r_1}{r_0} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this ratio back into the expression for the fractional flow ratio $f$:\n$$\nf = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1^4}{2^4} = \\frac{1}{16}\n$$\nA $50\\%$ reduction in arterial diameter results in a reduction of flow to $\\frac{1}{16}$ of its original value, assuming the pressure drop is maintained. This demonstrates the profound impact of the fourth-power dependence of flow on radius.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}\n$$", "id": "4884222"}, {"introduction": "After appreciating the physics of flow reduction, the next step is to measure its clinical impact.
