Your task is to structure a diagnostic algorithm that functions as a critical lifeline when definitive imaging is not immediately available [@problem_id:4823773].", "problem": "A patient presents to the emergency department with undifferentiated shock and abdominal pain. The goal is to design a Point-Of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) sequence that maximizes early detection of time-critical etiologies and directly maps findings to immediate interventions before definitive imaging.

If the maximal outer-to-outer diameter is $\\geq 3.0$ $\\mathrm{cm}$ and there is mural discontinuity or periaortic hematoma, treat as ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA): activate massive transfusion, maintain permissive hypotension, and obtain immediate vascular surgery involvement without waiting for CT.

I will first validate the problem statement and then proceed to a detailed solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following information:\n- **Patient Profile**: A $72$-year-old male.\n- **Medical History**: A $50$-pack-year smoking history, hypertension, no known prior biliary disease, no trauma history.\n- **Clinical Presentation**: Sudden severe epigastric pain radiating to the back.\n- **Vital Signs**: Blood Pressure (BP) = $78/46$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, Heart Rate (HR) = $118$ $\\mathrm{beats/minute}$, Respiratory Rate (RR) = $24$ $\\mathrm{breaths/minute}$, Temperature (T) = $36.6$ $\\mathrm{^{\\circ}C}$, Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) = $94\\%$ on $2$ $\\mathrm{L/min}$ nasal cannula.\n- **Physical Exam**: Diaphoretic, pale, distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness, equivocal peritoneal signs limited by body habitus.\n- **Resource Constraints**: Laboratory tests are pending. Immediate access to POCUS with a skilled operator. Computed Tomography (CT) is not available for at least $30$ $\\mathrm{minutes}$.\n- **Task**: To select the single best POCUS sequence (involving abdominal aorta, FAST, and right upper quadrant biliary) and corresponding decision thresholds that prioritize the most lethal causes of hypotension with abdominal pain and map to immediate interventions.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement will be validated against the criteria of being scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The clinical scenario is a classic and realistic emergency medicine presentation. The patient's demographics, risk factors (age, smoking, hypertension), and clinical signs (sudden severe pain radiating to the back, hypotension, tachycardia) are strongly suggestive of a life-threatening intra-abdominal catastrophe, with ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) being a primary concern. The use of POCUS as a rapid triage tool in undifferentiated shock is a cornerstone of modern emergency medicine, often formalized in protocols like the RUSH (Rapid Ultrasound for Shock and Hypotension) exam. The proposed diagnostic components (aorta, FAST, biliary) are standard views used to investigate the major categories of shock (hypovolemic/hemorrhagic, obstructive, cardiogenic, distributive). The problem is firmly based on established medical principles and clinical guidelines.\n\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for the optimal sequence and decision algorithm from a set of choices, given a clear clinical context and well-defined goal: maximizing early detection of time-critical etiologies. The constraints (e.g., CT delay) are critical and make the POCUS strategy the central challenge. A single \"best\" option can be determined by comparing the proposed algorithms to evidence-based best practices for managing this type of medical emergency.\n\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using objective clinical data (vitals, patient history) and standard medical terminology. The question, while using the word \"best,\" implies a standard of care guided by principles of risk stratification and timely intervention, which is an objective benchmark in medicine.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It represents a valid clinical reasoning problem. I will proceed with deriving the solution and evaluating the options.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Approach\nThe fundamental principle in managing a patient with undifferentiated shock is to rapidly identify and treat the most immediate life-threatening cause. The differential diagnosis for this patient includes, in rough order of immediate lethality and likelihood given the specific presentation:\n1.  **Hemorrhagic Shock**: Primarily from a ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). This diagnosis perfectly fits the patient's risk profile (age, male, smoker, hypertensive) and presentation (sudden, severe epigastric/back pain and profound hypotension). It carries an extremely high short-term mortality rate and requires immediate surgical intervention. Other causes of nontraumatic intra-abdominal hemorrhage are also possible.\n2.  **Distributive Shock**: Primarily from sepsis (e.g., cholangitis, perforated viscus). While common, the sudden, severe nature of the pain is more classic for a vascular or ischemic event than a typical infection, though perforated viscus or gangrenous cholecystitis can present this way.\n3.  **Obstructive Shock**: e.g., Massive Pulmonary Embolism (PE). Can cause syncope and hypotension, and right heart strain can lead to hepatic congestion and abdominal pain.\n4.  **Cardiogenic Shock**: e.g., Myocardial Infarction (MI), particularly an inferior wall MI which can present with epigastric pain.\n\nGiven the time-critical nature of a ruptured AAA, the POCUS sequence must prioritize its evaluation. A logical algorithm would be:\n1.  **Scan the Aorta**: This is the fastest way to investigate the most likely and most lethal diagnosis. A maximal outer-to-outer diameter $\\geq 3.0$ $\\mathrm{cm}$ defines an aneurysm. In a patient with hypotension and pain, finding an AAA is considered evidence of rupture until proven otherwise, and immediate vascular surgery consultation is mandatory, bypassing any non-essential or delaying imaging like CT. Resuscitation should target permissive hypotension (e.g., systolic BP $70-90$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$) to avoid dislodging any temporary clot.\n2.  **Perform FAST Exam**: If the aorta is not aneurysmal or does not show clear signs of rupture, the next step is to look for other sources of hemorrhage. The Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) exam is excellent for detecting free intraperitoneal fluid (hemoperitoneum). A positive FAST in a hypotensive patient warrants immediate surgical consultation for hemorrhage control.\n3.  **Evaluate for Other Causes**: If the aorta is normal and the FAST is negative, the likelihood of hemorrhagic shock decreases, and other etiologies like septic shock become more probable. A biliary ultrasound to look for signs of acute cholecystitis or cholangitis (e.g., gallstones, wall thickening, sonographic Murphy's sign, common bile duct dilation) is a logical next step.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Begin with an abdominal aorta scan (longitudinal and transverse from diaphragmatic hiatus to bifurcation). If the maximal outer-to-outer diameter is $\\geq 3.0$ $\\mathrm{cm}$ and there is mural discontinuity or periaortic hematoma, treat as ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA): activate massive transfusion, maintain permissive hypotension, and obtain immediate vascular surgery involvement without waiting for CT. If no aneurysm or an aneurysm without rupture features is identified, proceed to FAST (right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, and pelvis). If free intraperitoneal fluid is detected in the context of persistent hypotension, activate general surgery or Interventional Radiology (IR) for hemorrhage control. If FAST is negative, perform right upper quadrant biliary POCUS; if gallstones with gallbladder wall thickness $\\geq 3$ $\\mathrm{mm}$, a positive sonographic Murphy sign, and common bile duct dilation are present, treat as septic shock from acute cholangitis or complicated cholecystitis with immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors as needed, and urgent Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or percutaneous cholecystostomy depending on suspected source. Aim to complete this triage within $5$ $\\mathrm{minutes}$ while resuscitating.**\n\nThis option presents a sequence and management plan that aligns perfectly with established principles of emergency medicine.\n- **Sequence (Aorta → FAST → Biliary)**: This correctly prioritizes the most lethal and likely diagnosis (ruptured AAA) first, followed by other hemorrhagic causes, and then septic causes. This is the most logical and efficient approach.\n- **Decision Thresholds and Interventions**:\n    - The criteria for diagnosing AAA ($\\geq 3.0$ $\\mathrm{cm}$) is standard.\n    - The management plan for a suspected ruptured AAA (MTP activation, permissive hypotension, immediate vascular surgery consult, bypassing CT) is the accepted standard of care and is life-saving.\n    - The management for a positive FAST (consult for hemorrhage control) is appropriate.\n    - The management for POCUS findings suggestive of biliary sepsis (antibiotics, resuscitation, source control) is also correct.\n- **Timeline**: A goal of completing this triage in $5$ $\\mathrm{minutes}$ is aggressive but appropriate for POCUS in a critically ill patient.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Begin with FAST of the abdomen (right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, pelvis). If negative, perform right upper quadrant biliary POCUS. If gallstones and gallbladder wall thickening are present, admit to general surgery and obtain CT to confirm before any intervention. Only if both FAST and biliary scans are negative, scan the abdominal aorta; defer vascular surgery notification until CT confirms AAA. Provide $2$ $\\mathrm{L}$ of crystalloid upfront to improve ultrasound windows.**\n\nThis option contains multiple, serious errors.\n- **Sequence (FAST → Biliary → Aorta)**: This de-prioritizes the most likely and lethal diagnosis. A ruptured AAA can be contained in the retroperitoneum and may not cause a positive FAST exam initially. Placing the aortic scan last is a critical flaw.\n- **Interventions**: Deferring vascular surgery notification until CT confirmation of a POCUS-identified AAA in a hypotensive patient introduces a potentially fatal delay. The recommendation to provide $2$ $\\mathrm{L}$ of crystalloid is dangerous in potential hemorrhagic shock (can worsen bleeding, cause coagulopathy) and the justification (\"to improve ultrasound windows\") is nonsensical from a physics perspective.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Begin with right upper quadrant biliary POCUS because sepsis is a common shock etiology; if gallstones are present, initiate antibiotics and defer further ultrasound until after CT. If biliary scan is negative, perform FAST; if free fluid is present, give $2$ $\\mathrm{L}$ crystalloid and obtain CT angiography before surgery. Evaluate the aorta last because AAA is relatively rare and difficult to visualize.**\n\nThis option demonstrates poor clinical reasoning.\n- **Sequence (Biliary → FAST → Aorta)**: This sequence incorrectly prioritizes sepsis over hemorrhagic shock, which contradicts the clinical presentation (sudden severe pain).\n- **Justification**: The claim that AAA is \"relatively rare\" is misleading; in this specific patient demographic and presentation, it is a high-probability diagnosis. The claim that the aorta is \"difficult to visualize\" is also generally false for the purpose of measuring diameter; it is a core POCUS competency.\n- **Interventions**: Deferring definitive intervention (surgery) for imaging (CT) in the setting of positive FAST and hypotension is a dangerous delay. The recommendation of a $2$ $\\mathrm{L}$ crystalloid bolus is again inappropriate for potential hemorrhage.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Begin with an abdominal aorta scan; if the diameter is $>3$ $\\mathrm{cm}$, start broad-spectrum antibiotics and give $3$ $\\mathrm{L}$ crystalloid before consulting vascular surgery, because hypotension may be distributive. If the aortic scan is normal, skip FAST and obtain CT to localize bleeding. Perform biliary ultrasound only after CT to avoid delaying definitive imaging.**\n\nThis option begins with the correct first step but follows it with incorrect and dangerous actions.\n- **Interventions for AAA**: Upon finding an AAA ($>3$ $\\mathrm{cm}$), the correct pathway is to assume rupture and proceed with hemorrhage control. Instead, this option suggests treating for sepsis (antibiotics) and giving a massive $3$ $\\mathrm{L}$ crystalloid bolus, which would be catastrophic in a patient with a ruptured AAA. The reasoning \"because hypotension may be distributive\" is a fatal misinterpretation of risk. One must treat the most dangerous, anatomically confirmed finding first.\n- **Subsequent Steps**: Skipping the FAST exam is a mistake. It is a rapid bedside test that adds valuable information about intraperitoneal fluid. Going directly to CT after a normal aortic scan without a FAST exam forgoes an opportunity for rapid diagnosis of another bleeding source.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nIn summary, Option A provides a clinically sound, safe, and efficient algorithm that correctly prioritizes the most lethal conditions and links ultrasound findings to immediate, appropriate, life-saving interventions, consistent with established medical best practices.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4823773"}, {"introduction": "Diagnosis is rarely a static event; it is a dynamic process of evidence gathering and probability revision.

The initial subtle presentation followed by migration of pain, development of focal findings, fever, and leukocytosis is medically sound and highly realistic. The use of likelihood ratios for updating probability is a standard technique in evidence-based medicine. The provided $LR_+$ values are reasonable approximations for the specified findings.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem is structured as a decision-making task based on evolving clinical data. It provides a clear initial state ($p_0 = 0.15$) and sufficient new information (clinical findings and their $LR_+$) to formally update the diagnostic probability. The question asks for the \"single best option,\" which implies a unique optimal choice based on established medical and statistical principles.\n*   **Objective:** The presentation of the clinical case is objective, reporting signs, symptoms, and lab values without interpretive language in the setup. The framing around cognitive bias mitigation adds a layer of complexity but is also grounded in the formal study of medical decision-making.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective scenario that can be rigorously analyzed using principles of medicine and probability. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\n**1. Probabilistic Update**\n\nThe initial pretest probability of appendicitis is $p_0 = 0.15$. The corresponding pretest odds are calculated as:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{p_0}{1 - p_0} = \\frac{0.15}{1 - 0.15} = \\frac{0.15}{0.85} \\approx 0.17647 $$\n\nAt the $6$-hour follow-up, the patient exhibits four new findings for which positive likelihood ratios ($LR_+$) are provided:\n1.  Fever (T = $38.2^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$): $LR_{+, \\text{fever}} = 1.5$\n2.  Leukocytosis (WBC = $14 \\times 10^9/\\mathrm{L}$): $LR_{+, \\text{WBC}} = 2.0$\n3.  Localized RLQ tenderness: $LR_{+, \\text{RLQ}} = 3.0$\n4.  Rebound tenderness: $LR_{+, \\text{rebound}} = 2.5$\n\nAssuming conditional independence of these findings for the purpose of this calculation, the combined likelihood ratio is the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$ LR_{+, \\text{combined}} = LR_{+, \\text{fever}} \\times LR_{+, \\text{WBC}} \\times LR_{+, \\text{RLQ}} \\times LR_{+, \\text{rebound}} $$\n$$ LR_{+, \\text{combined}} = 1.5 \\times 2.0 \\times 3.0 \\times 2.5 = 3.0 \\times 7.5 = 22.5 $$\n\nThe post-test odds are found by multiplying the pretest odds by the combined likelihood ratio:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR_{+, \\text{combined}} \\approx 0.17647 \\times 22.5 \\approx 3.97058 $$\n\nFinally, we convert the post-test odds back to a probability:\n$$ p_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}} \\approx \\frac{3.97058}{1 + 3.97058} = \\frac{3.97058}{4.97058} \\approx 0.7988 $$\n\nThe updated probability of appendicitis is approximately $80\\%$. This significant increase from $15\\%$ moves the patient from a low-intermediate risk category to a high-risk category, indicating that a decision threshold for definitive action has been crossed.\n\n**2. Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Continue observation without imaging, attributing changes to self-limited gastroenteritis; repeat CBC in $12$ hours. To mitigate bias, reaffirm the initial low-risk categorization in the electronic health record (EHR) and avoid “over-testing.”**\n\n*   **Clinical/Probabilistic Analysis:** This action is inappropriate and unsafe. It ignores the new, high-risk clinical picture and the updated probability of $\\approx 80\\%$. Attributing these findings to gastroenteritis is a significant misjudgment that risks severe complications from untreated appendicitis, such as perforation.\n*   **Bias Mitigation Analysis:** The proposed \"mitigation\" is a textbook example of succumbing to bias, not preventing it. Reaffirming the initial low-risk status is **anchoring bias**. Avoiding testing in the face of compelling new evidence is **confirmation bias**.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Explicitly re-estimate the probability of appendicitis using sequential evidence, recognizing that decision thresholds for testing and treatment are likely crossed; urgently obtain computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous (IV) contrast, start broad-spectrum preoperative antibiotics (for example, ceftriaxone plus metronidazole) after blood cultures, and consult general surgery. To mitigate bias, perform a documented “diagnostic timeout,” solicit a second clinician’s perspective, and revise the problem representation to avoid anchoring, confirmation bias, and premature closure.**\n\n*   **Clinical/Probabilistic Analysis:** This option is clinically exemplary. It correctly updates the probability, recognizes the crossing of a decision threshold, and initiates the standard-of-care management for a high-risk, non-pregnant adult with suspected appendicitis. This includes definitive imaging (CT), surgical consultation, and initiation of appropriate preoperative antibiotics.\n*   **Bias Mitigation Analysis:** The proposed strategies are correct and sophisticated. Explicitly re-estimating probability, conducting a \"diagnostic timeout\" to reassess, involving another clinician, and consciously revising the problem representation are all validated techniques to counteract anchoring, confirmation bias, and premature closure.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**C. Proceed directly to appendectomy based solely on leukocytosis and localized tenderness; bypass imaging to avoid delay. To mitigate bias, commit early to a single diagnosis and limit further data collection to prevent “paralysis by analysis.”**\n\n*   **Clinical/Probabilistic Analysis:** While the probability of appendicitis is high ($\\approx 80\\%$), it is not a certainty. Proceeding directly to surgery without imaging carries a substantial risk ($\\approx 20\\%$) of a negative appendectomy and fails to evaluate for alternative diagnoses common in young women (e.g., adnexal pathology). In a stable patient, a rapid CT scan enhances diagnostic precision with minimal delay.\n*   **Bias Mitigation Analysis:** The proposed strategy is flawed. \"Commit early to a single diagnosis\" is the definition of **premature closure**. Limiting data collection is a component of **confirmation bias**. This is the opposite of a valid mitigation strategy.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Obtain abdominal ultrasound as the only imaging study; if nondiagnostic, discharge with return precautions. To mitigate bias, use availability heuristics favoring radiation avoidance and maintain the initial low-risk impression to prevent “over-diagnosis.”**\n\n*   **Clinical/Probabilistic Analysis:** The plan to discharge a patient with a high pre-test probability of appendicitis ($\\approx 80\\%$) after a nondiagnostic ultrasound is unsafe and constitutes medical negligence. While ultrasound may be a first step, a nondiagnostic result in a high-risk patient necessitates further evaluation, typically with a CT scan.\n*   **Bias Mitigation Analysis:** The proposed logic is fallacious. It advocates for acting on biases (availability heuristic, anchoring) rather than mitigating them. \"Maintain the initial low-risk impression\" is anchoring. Invoking the availability heuristic for radiation avoidance inappropriately trumps the need for an accurate diagnosis in a high-risk scenario.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Request surgical consultation but defer antibiotics until imaging proves appendicitis, preserving diagnostic purity. To mitigate bias, maintain the original working diagnosis and avoid incorporating conflicting data until definitive confirmation.**\n\n*   **Clinical/Probabilistic Analysis:** While a surgical consult is necessary, withholding antibiotics in a febrile, tachycardic patient with suspected bacterial infection is contrary to best practices for preventing sepsis and surgical site infections. The notion of \"diagnostic purity\" is an outdated concept that prioritizes diagnostic elegance over patient safety and timely treatment.\n*   **Bias Mitigation Analysis:** Once again, the proposed strategy describes the commission of cognitive errors, not their mitigation. \"Maintain the original working diagnosis\" is **anchoring**, and \"avoid incorporating conflicting data\" is a willful act of **confirmation bias**.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4823821"}, {"introduction": "After developing a high suspicion for a diagnosis like appendicitis, the next step is to choose the optimal diagnostic strategy.

It provides a self-contained set of definitions, data, and tasks that can be addressed using established principles of medical statistics and decision analysis. All necessary information is present, and there are no contradictions. We may therefore proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe solution is structured into four main parts:\n1.  Calculation of the Alvarado and Appendicitis Inflammatory Response (AIR) scores for the given patient.\n2.  Calculation of the pretest probability of acute appendicitis using an inverse-variance weighted combination of logistic models.\n3.  Calculation of the expected net benefit for two diagnostic imaging strategies: Abdominal Ultrasonography (US) and Computed Tomography (CT).\n4.  Selection of the optimal strategy based on maximizing the expected net benefit.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Clinical Scores**\n\nFirst, we calculate the Alvarado score, denoted as $s_{\\mathrm{A}}$, based on the patient's signs, symptoms, and laboratory results. The score components are:\n- Migration of pain to RLQ: Yes ($1$ point)\n- Anorexia: Yes ($1$ point)\n- Nausea/vomiting: Yes ($1$ point)\n- RLQ tenderness: Yes ($2$ points)\n- Rebound pain: Yes ($1$ point)\n- Elevated temperature ($T = 38.1\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} \\ge 37.3\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$): Yes ($1$ point)\n- Leukocytosis ($\\mathrm{WBC} = 11{,}200\\,\\mathrm{/}\\mu\\mathrm{L} > 10{,}000\\,\\mathrm{/}\\mu\\mathrm{L}$): Yes ($2$ points)\n- Left shift (neutrophil proportion $= 0.74$, not $> 0.75$): No ($0$ points)\n\nThe total Alvarado score is the sum of these points:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 9$$\n\nNext, we calculate the AIR score, denoted as $s_{\\mathrm{B}}$:\n- Vomiting: Yes ($1$ point)\n- Pain in RLQ: Yes ($1$ point)\n- Rebound tenderness or muscular defense (mild): Yes ($1$ point)\n- Temperature ($T = 38.1\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, not $\\ge 38.5\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$): No ($0$ points)\n- WBC count ($11.2 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{/}\\mu\\mathrm{L}$, in range $10.0$–$14.9 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{/}\\mu\\mathrm{L}$): Yes ($1$ point)\n- Neutrophil proportion ($0.74$, in range $0.70$–$0.84$): Yes ($1$ point)\n- C-reactive protein ($\\mathrm{CRP} = 45\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$, in range $10$–$49\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$): Yes ($1$ point)\n\nThe total AIR score is:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Pretest Probability**\n\nWe use the provided logistic calibration models, $\\mathrm{logit}(p) = a + b\\,s$, to estimate the probability of appendicitis from each score.\n\nFor the Alvarado score ($s_{\\mathrm{A}} = 9$), with $a_{\\mathrm{A}} = -5.1$ and $b_{\\mathrm{A}} = 0.78$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{A}} = a_{\\mathrm{A}} + b_{\\mathrm{A}} s_{\\mathrm{A}} = -5.1 + (0.78)(9) = -5.1 + 7.02 = 1.92$$\n\nFor the AIR score ($s_{\\mathrm{B}} = 6$), with $a_{\\mathrm{B}} = -3.1$ and $b_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0.52$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{B}} = a_{\\mathrm{B}} + b_{\\mathrm{B}} s_{\\mathrm{B}} = -3.1 + (0.52)(6) = -3.1 + 3.12 = 0.02$$\n\nThese two logit predictions, $L_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{B}}$, are combined using inverse-variance weighting. The weights are the inverse of the squared standard errors of the linear predictors, $s_{\\mathrm{A}} = 0.35$ and $s_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0.50$.\n$$w_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{1}{s_{\\mathrm{A}}^{2}} = \\frac{1}{(0.35)^{2}} = \\frac{1}{0.1225} \\approx 8.1633$$\n$$w_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{1}{s_{\\mathrm{B}}^{2}} = \\frac{1}{(0.50)^{2}} = \\frac{1}{0.25} = 4$$\n\nThe combined weighted logit, $L_{\\mathrm{w}}$, is:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{w}} = \\frac{w_{\\mathrm{A}} L_{\\mathrm{A}} + w_{\\mathrm{B}} L_{\\mathrm{B}}}{w_{\\mathrm{A}} + w_{\\mathrm{B}}} = \\frac{(\\frac{1}{0.1225})(1.92) + (4)(0.02)}{\\frac{1}{0.1225} + 4} = \\frac{15.673469... + 0.08}{8.163265... + 4} = \\frac{15.753469...}{12.163265...} \\approx 1.29517$$\n\nThe pretest probability of appendicitis, $p$, is obtained by applying the inverse logit function:\n$$p = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-L_{\\mathrm{w}})} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-1.29517)} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 0.27386} \\approx 0.78499$$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Net Benefit for Imaging Strategies**\n\nFirst, we must derive the sensitivity ($\\mathrm{Se}$) and specificity ($\\mathrm{Sp}$) of each test from its positive and negative likelihood ratios ($\\mathrm{LR}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{LR}^{-}$). The defining equations are:\n$\\mathrm{LR}^{+} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Se}}{1 - \\mathrm{Sp}}$ and $\\mathrm{LR}^{-} = \\frac{1 - \\mathrm{Se}}{\\mathrm{Sp}}$.\nSolving this system of two linear equations for $\\mathrm{Se}$ and $\\mathrm{Sp}$ yields:\n$$\\mathrm{Sp} = \\frac{1 - \\mathrm{LR}^{+}}{ \\mathrm{LR}^{-} - \\mathrm{LR}^{+}}$$\n$$\\mathrm{Se} = \\mathrm{LR}^{+}(1 - \\mathrm{Sp})$$\n\nFor **Abdominal Ultrasonography (US)**, with $\\mathrm{LR}^{+}_{\\mathrm{US}} = 6.0$ and $\\mathrm{LR}^{-}_{\\mathrm{US}} = 0.20$:\n$$\\mathrm{Sp}_{\\mathrm{US}} = \\frac{1 - 6.0}{0.20 - 6.0} = \\frac{-5.0}{-5.8} = \\frac{25}{29} \\approx 0.86207$$\n$$\\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{US}} = 6.0 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{25}{29}\\right) = 6.0 \\times \\frac{4}{29} = \\frac{24}{29} \\approx 0.82759$$\n\nThe expected correct classification for US is $E_{\\text{correct, US}} = p\\,\\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{US}} + (1 - p)\\,\\mathrm{Sp}_{\\mathrm{US}}$:\n$$E_{\\text{correct, US}} = (0.78499)\\left(\\frac{24}{29}\\right) + (1 - 0.78499)\\left(\\frac{25}{29}\\right) \\approx (0.78499)(0.82759) + (0.21501)(0.86207) \\approx 0.65000 + 0.18535 \\approx 0.83535$$\nThe expected Net Benefit for US is $\\mathrm{NB}_{\\mathrm{US}} = E_{\\text{correct, US}} - c_{\\mathrm{US}}$, with $c_{\\mathrm{US}} = 0.001$:\n$$\\mathrm{NB}_{\\mathrm{US}} = 0.83535 - 0.001 = 0.83435$$\n\nFor **Computed Tomography (CT)**, with $\\mathrm{LR}^{+}_{\\mathrm{CT}} = 20.0$ and $\\mathrm{LR}^{-}_{\\mathrm{CT}} = 0.05$:\n$$\\mathrm{Sp}_{\\mathrm{CT}} = \\frac{1 - 20.0}{0.05 - 20.0} = \\frac{-19}{-19.95} = \\frac{19}{19.95} = \\frac{380}{399} \\approx 0.95238$$\n$$\\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{CT}} = 20.0 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{380}{399}\\right) = 20.0 \\times \\frac{19}{399} = \\frac{380}{399} \\approx 0.95238$$\nNote that for CT, $\\mathrm{LR}^{+}_{\\mathrm{CT}} \\times \\mathrm{LR}^{-}_{\\mathrm{CT}} = 20.0 \\times 0.05 = 1$, which implies $\\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{CT}} = \\mathrm{Sp}_{\\mathrm{CT}}$.\n\nThe expected correct classification for CT is $E_{\\text{correct, CT}} = p\\,\\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{CT}} + (1 - p)\\,\\mathrm{Sp}_{\\mathrm{CT}}$. Since $\\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{CT}} = \\mathrm{Sp}_{\\mathrm{CT}}$, this simplifies:\n$$E_{\\text{correct, CT}} = (p + (1-p)) \\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{CT}} = (1) \\mathrm{Se}_{\\mathrm{CT}} = \\frac{380}{399} \\approx 0.95238$$\nThe expected Net Benefit for CT is $\\mathrm{NB}_{\\mathrm{CT}} = E_{\\text{correct, CT}} - c_{\\mathrm{CT}}$, with $c_{\\mathrm{CT}} = 0.010$:\n$$\\mathrm{NB}_{\\mathrm{CT}} = \\frac{380}{399} - 0.010 \\approx 0.95238 - 0.010 = 0.94238$$\n\n**Part 4: Selection of an Optimal Strategy**\n\nTo select the imaging strategy that maximizes net benefit, we compare $\\mathrm{NB}_{\\mathrm{US}}$ and $\\mathrm{NB}_{\\mathrm{CT}}$:\n$$\\mathrm{NB}_{\\mathrm{US}} \\approx 0.83435$$\n$$\\mathrm{NB}_{\\mathrm{CT}} \\approx 0.94238$$\nSince $\\mathrm{NB}_{\\mathrm{CT}} > \\mathrm{NB}_{\\mathrm{US}}$, the optimal strategy is to perform a CT scan. The expected net benefit of this optimal strategy is approximately $0.94238$.\n\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures gives $0.9424$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9424}\n$$", "id": "4823803"}]}
