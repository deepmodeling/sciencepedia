The concepts of immunogenicity, anti-drug antibodies (ADA), therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), and pharmacokinetic modeling are central to this field. The provided values for trough concentration, half-life, and dosing interval are all within a plausible range for this specific clinical situation.\n- It is **well-posed**: The problem is divided into a qualitative reasoning part and a quantitative calculation. The quantitative part provides all necessary data and a clear set of assumptions ($D$ and $V_d$ constant, first-order kinetics) to arrive at a unique solution for the new dosing interval $\\tau'$.\n- It is **objective**: The problem statement is free of subjective language and presents a clear, formalizable task based on established medical and pharmacokinetic principles. There are no contradictions or ambiguities in the provided information.\n\n### Step 2: Solution\n\nThe solution is addressed in two parts as requested by the problem.\n\n**Part 1: Choice of Clinical Strategy**\n\nThe patient presents with active Crohn's disease despite infliximab therapy, a low trough concentration ($2~\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{mL}$), and high titers of anti-drug antibodies (ADA). This clinical picture is defined as secondary loss of response due to immunogenicity. The short effective half-life of $4$ days, significantly less than the typical $8-10$ days for infliximab, is a direct consequence of this immunogenicity. High levels of ADAs form immune complexes with infliximab, leading to their rapid clearance from the circulation via the reticuloendothelial system.\n\nIn this context, there are two main strategies: dose intensification or switching to another agent.\n\n1.  **Dose Intensification:** This involves increasing the dose or, more commonly, decreasing the dosing interval. The intent is to saturate the ADAs and achieve a therapeutic drug concentration. While this might transiently increase the trough level, it is generally considered an inappropriate long-term strategy in the presence of **high** ADA titers for several reasons:\n    - **Worsening Immunogenicity:** Administering more infliximab (the antigen) can further stimulate the immune system, potentially leading to even higher ADA levels and a \"cat-and-mouse\" game of escalating doses with diminishing returns.\n    - **Risk of Adverse Events:** The formation of infliximab-ADA immune complexes increases the risk of infusion reactions, which can range from mild to severe (e.g., serum sickness-like reactions, a type III hypersensitivity).\n    - **Ineffectiveness:** With high-titer neutralizing ADAs, even significantly increased doses may be insufficient to restore a durable clinical response.\n\n2.  **Mechanistic Switch:** This involves discontinuing the anti-TNF agent and initiating therapy with a drug from a different class. Options include agents targeting integrins (e.g., vedolizumab) or the IL-12/23 pathway (e.g., ustekinumab). This strategy has several advantages:\n    - **Bypassing the Immune Response:** The new drug has a different molecular structure, so the pre-existing ADAs against infliximab will not cross-react with it. This circumvents the problem of immunogenicity entirely.\n    - **Higher Likelihood of Response:** By introducing a novel mechanism of action, this approach offers a greater chance of inducing remission in a patient who has failed anti-TNF therapy due to immunogenicity.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 1:** Given the high ADA levels, the fundamentally more appropriate and safer long-term strategy is a **mechanistic switch to a non-TNF pathway agent**. Dose intensification is a suboptimal approach associated with risks and a low probability of sustained success.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the New Dosing Interval ($\\tau'$)**\n\nThis calculation is performed under the hypothetical and clinically inadvisable assumption that dose intensification by interval shortening is chosen. We use the one-compartment IV bolus model at steady state.\n\nThe trough concentration ($C_{trough}$) at steady state, after repeated IV bolus administration of a dose $D$ every interval $\\tau$, is given by:\n$$C_{trough} = \\frac{D/V_d}{\\exp(k\\tau) - 1}$$\nwhere $V_d$ is the volume of distribution and $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\nWe are given the initial conditions (state 1) and target conditions (state 2):\n- State 1: $C_{trough,1} = 2~\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{mL}$, $\\tau_1 = 56$ days.\n- State 2: $C_{trough,2} = 7~\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{mL}$, $\\tau_2 = \\tau'$ (to be determined).\n\nThe problem states that the dose $D$ and volume of distribution $V_d$ are constant. The elimination rate constant $k$ is also constant, as it is determined by the patient's immune-mediated clearance, which we assume does not change with the dosing schedule. The value of $k$ is derived from the half-life $t_{1/2}$:\n$$k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{4}~\\text{days}^{-1}$$\n\nSince the term $D/V_d$ is constant, we can write:\n$$D/V_d = C_{trough,1} (\\exp(k\\tau_1) - 1)$$\n$$D/V_d = C_{trough,2} (\\exp(k\\tau_2) - 1)$$\n\nEquating these two expressions gives:\n$$C_{trough,1} (\\exp(k\\tau_1) - 1) = C_{trough,2} (\\exp(k\\tau_2) - 1)$$\n\nWe need to solve for $\\tau_2 = \\tau'$.
