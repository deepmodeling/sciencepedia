A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has an active *H. pylori* infection, and let $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not. Let $T^+$ denote a positive test result and $T^-$ denote a negative test result.\n\nThe given information can be expressed in probabilistic terms:\n- Prevalence, $P(D) = 0.25$. The probability of not having the disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n- Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test given the disease is present: $P(T^+ | D) = 0.92$.\n- Specificity is the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent: $P(T^- | D^c) = 0.94$.\n\nFrom these, we can derive two other conditional probabilities:\n- The false positive rate is the probability of a positive test given the disease is absent: $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.94 = 0.06$.\n- The false negative rate is the probability of a negative test given the disease is present: $P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$.\n\n#### Derivation and Calculation of Positive Predictive Value (PPV)\nThe PPV is the probability that a patient has the disease given a positive test result, i.e., $P(D | T^+)$. Using Bayes' theorem, this is expressed as:\n$$ PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. It can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for PPV gives the complete derived formula:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)} $$\nThis expression represents the ratio of true positives to all positives (true positives + false positives).\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{(0.92)(0.25)}{(0.92)(0.25) + (0.06)(0.75)} = \\frac{0.23}{0.23 + 0.045} = \\frac{0.23}{0.275} $$\n$$ PPV \\approx 0.83636363...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $PPV = 0.8364$.\n\n#### Derivation and Calculation of Negative Predictive Value (NPV)\nThe NPV is the probability that a patient does not have the disease given a negative test result, i.e., $P(D^c | T^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test result. Using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D) $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for NPV gives the complete derived formula:\n$$ NPV = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)} $$\nThis expression represents the ratio of true negatives to all negatives (true negatives + false negatives).\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$ NPV = \\frac{(0.94)(0.75)}{(0.94)(0.75) + (0.08)(0.25)} = \\frac{0.705}{0.705 + 0.02} = \\frac{0.705}{0.725} $$\n$$ NPV \\approx 0.97241379...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $NPV = 0.9724$.\n\n#### Clinical Interpretation\nThe calculated predictive values are essential for informing a clinical test-and-treat strategy for *H. pylori*-related peptic ulcer disease in this population.\n\n- **Positive Predictive Value ($PPV = 0.8364$)**: This value indicates that among patients with dyspepsia in this setting who test positive, there is an $83.64\\%$ probability that they truly have an *H. pylori* infection. This is a strong, but not perfect, post-test probability. For a test-and-treat strategy, a clinician must weigh the benefits of correctly treating $83.64\\%$ of positive-testing individuals against the risks of unnecessarily treating the remaining $16.36\\%$ (the false positives) with antibiotics and a proton-pump inhibitor. Given that *H. pylori* eradication can cure peptic ulcers and prevent complications like gastric cancer, and the treatment regimen is generally safe, a PPV of this magnitude is typically considered sufficient to justify initiating treatment without further, more invasive confirmatory testing (such as endoscopy with biopsy).\n\n- **Negative Predictive Value ($NPV = 0.9724$)**: This value indicates that for a patient who tests negative, there is a $97.24\\%$ probability that they are genuinely free of *H. pylori* infection. This is a very high degree of certainty. The probability of a false negative (i.e., having the infection despite a negative test) is only $1 - 0.9724 = 0.0276$, or approximately $2.8\\%$. An NPV this high makes the test extremely effective for \"ruling out\" the disease. A clinician can be very confident that a negative result accurately reflects the absence of infection and can therefore reliably look for other causes of the patient's dyspepsia, avoiding unnecessary treatment and delaying the search for the true diagnosis.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.8364 & 0.9724 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4883081"}, {"introduction": "Selecting an effective empiric eradication regimen for *H. pylori* requires a quantitative understanding of local antibiotic resistance patterns, a factor complicated by strains resistant to multiple agents like clarithromycin and metronidazole.

Susceptible to both agents ($S_{Both}$): The event $R_C^c \\cap R_M^c$.\n2.  Resistant to clarithromycin only ($R_{C,only}$): The event $R_C \\cap R_M^c$.\n3.  Resistant to metronidazole only ($R_{M,only}$): The event $R_C^c \\cap R_M$.\n4.  Resistant to both agents ($R_{Both}$): The event $R_C \\cap R_M$.\n\nBecause $R_C$ and $R_M$ are independent, their complements $R_C^c$ and $R_M^c$ are also independent.
