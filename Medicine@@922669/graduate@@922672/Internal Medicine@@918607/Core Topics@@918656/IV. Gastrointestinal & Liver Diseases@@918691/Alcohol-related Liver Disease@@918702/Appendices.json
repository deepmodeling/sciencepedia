The mass of ethanol consumed per week, $m_{EtOH, weekly}$, is given by the relation mass = density $\\times$ volume.\n$$m_{EtOH, weekly} = V_{EtOH, weekly} \\times \\rho_{EtOH} = (N_{pints} \\times V_{pint} \\times f_{ABV}) \\times \\rho_{EtOH}$$\n\nFinally, to find the average daily dose, $D_{daily}$, we divide the total weekly mass of ethanol by the number of days in a week.\n$$D_{daily} = \\frac{m_{EtOH, weekly}}{T_{week}} = \\frac{N_{pints} \\times V_{pint} \\times f_{ABV} \\times \\rho_{EtOH}}{T_{week}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$$D_{daily} = \\frac{14 \\text{ week}^{-1} \\times 473 \\text{ mL} \\times 0.05 \\times 0.789 \\text{ g/mL}}{7 \\text{ day/week}}$$\n\nPerforming the calculation:\nThe numerator is $14 \\times 473 \\times 0.05 \\times 0.789 = 261.2379$ g.\n$$D_{daily} = \\frac{261.2379 \\text{ g}}{7 \\text{ day}} \\approx 37.3197 \\text{ g/day}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
