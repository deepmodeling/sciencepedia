The problem is scientifically grounded in the field of hepatology and is well-posed.\n\nThe task is to compute the total diagnostic score for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) using the simplified International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG) criteria. This scoring system is based on four parameters: autoantibodies, serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) level, liver histology, and the absence of viral hepatitis. We will evaluate each component based on the data provided in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Autoantibodies:** The patient's antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer is given as $1:160$. According to the simplified IAIHG criteria, an ANA titer of $\\ge 1:40$ scores $1$ point, and a titer of $\\ge 1:80$ scores $2$ points. Since $160 \\ge 80$, this component contributes $2$ points to the total score.\n\n2.  **Serum Immunoglobulin G (IgG):** The patient's serum IgG level is elevated to $1.8 \\times$ the upper limit of normal (ULN). The scoring criteria assign $1$ point for an IgG level greater than the ULN and $2$ points for an IgG level greater than $1.10 \\times$ the ULN. Since $1.8 > 1.10$, this component contributes $2$ points to the score.\n\n3.  **Liver Histology:** The liver biopsy findings are described as \"interface hepatitis with a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and hepatocyte rosette formation,\" which the pathologist deemed \"typical for autoimmune hepatitis.\" The simplified criteria award $1$ point for histology \"compatible with AIH\" and $2$ points for histology \"typical for AIH.\" The description provided corresponds to the \"typical\" features. Therefore, this component contributes $2$ points.\n\n4.  **Absence of Viral Hepatitis:** The problem states that serologies for viral hepatitis, specifically hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody, are negative. The presence of this finding (i.e., the absence of active viral hepatitis) contributes $2$ points to the score.\n\nThe total simplified IAIHG score is the sum of the points from these four categories.\n\nTotal Score = (Autoantibody score) + (IgG score) + (Histology score) + (Absence of viral hepatitis score)\n\n$$\n\\text{Total Score} = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8\n$$\n\nThe interpretation of the final score is as follows:\n- A score of $\\ge 6$ indicates \"probable AIH.\"\n- A score of $\\ge 7$ indicates \"definite AIH.\"\n\nWith a total score of $8$, the patient's presentation corresponds to a diagnosis of definite autoimmune hepatitis.
