The 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria operationalize this process through a weighted, points-based system. This practice provides direct experience applying these essential criteria, reinforcing the modern understanding of RA as a syndrome defined by an accumulation of evidence across multiple domains [@problem_id:4447055].", "problem": "In the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification framework for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the disease is classified using a weighted, domain-based scoring system that aggregates evidence from joint involvement, serology, acute-phase reactants, and symptom duration. This approach is grounded in the principle that independent pathological domains contribute additive evidence toward classification. The foundational facts for this derivation are: (i) independent domains are aggregated linearly; (ii) each domain contributes a fixed number of points determined by validated criteria; and (iii) the total score is the sum of domain contributions.\n\nConsider a patient in whom the following domain-level findings have been established by standard clinical and laboratory methods:\n- Joint involvement: involvement of $10$ small joints, qualifying for the small-joint category.\n- Serology: high-positive anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody, defined per assay as above the high-positive threshold.\n- Acute-phase reactants: abnormal C-reactive protein (CRP).\n- Duration: symptom duration greater than $6$ weeks.\n\nUse the following empirically validated point allocations, which reflect the weighting of evidence in each domain:\n- Small-joint involvement at the level described above contributes $5$ points.\n- High-positive serology (anti-CCP or rheumatoid factor) contributes $3$ points.\n- Abnormal acute-phase reactants (CRP or erythrocyte sedimentation rate) contribute $1$ point.\n- Symptom duration greater than $6$ weeks contributes $1$ point.\n\nStarting from the principle that the total classification score is an additive aggregation of domain-specific contributions, construct a symbolic scoring function that maps these domain indicators to a total score, and then evaluate this function for the patient described. Express the final score as an exact number. No rounding is required, and no units are to be used in the final answer.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe givens are extracted verbatim from the problem statement:\n- **Principle (i):** \"independent domains are aggregated linearly\"\n- **Principle (ii):** \"each domain contributes a fixed number of points determined by validated criteria\"\n- **Principle (iii):** \"the total score is the sum of domain contributions\"\n- **Patient Finding (Joints):** \"involvement of $10$ small joints, qualifying for the small-joint category.\"\n- **Patient Finding (Serology):** \"high-positive anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody, defined per assay as above the high-positive threshold.\"\n- **Patient Finding (Reactants):** \"abnormal C-reactive protein (CRP).\"\n- **Patient Finding (Duration):** \"symptom duration greater than $6$ weeks.\"\n- **Point Allocation (Joints):** \"Small-joint involvement at the level described above contributes $5$ points.\"\n- **Point Allocation (Serology):** \"High-positive serology (anti-CCP or rheumatoid factor) contributes $3$ points.\"\n- **Point Allocation (Reactants):** \"Abnormal acute-phase reactants (CRP or erythrocyte sedimentation rate) contribute $1$ point.\"\n- **Point Allocation (Duration):** \"Symptom duration greater than $6$ weeks contributes $1$ point.\"\n- **Task:** \"construct a symbolic scoring function that maps these domain indicators to a total score, and then evaluate this function for the patient described.\"\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis, a standard and widely accepted clinical tool in rheumatology. The principles of additive scoring and the specific point values for the described clinical findings are factually correct and derived directly from the published guidelines. The problem is firmly grounded in established medical science.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a complete set of patient findings and a corresponding, unambiguous scoring system. The instruction to sum the points leads to a unique and meaningful numerical solution.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem uses precise, objective clinical terminology and provides explicit numerical values for scoring. It is free of ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It contains no contradictions or missing information. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe problem requires the construction of a symbolic scoring function and its evaluation for a specific case. The fundamental principle stated is that the total classification score is an additive aggregation of contributions from independent domains.\n\nLet the total score be denoted by the variable $S$. The four domains are joint involvement, serology, acute-phase reactants, and duration. We can define symbolic variables representing the points contributed by each domain:\n- $P_J$: Points for joint involvement.\n- $P_S$: Points for serology.\n- $P_A$: Points for acute-phase reactants.\n- $P_D$: Points for symptom duration.\n\nBased on the principle of linear, additive aggregation, the symbolic scoring function $S$ is the sum of the points from each domain. The function maps the set of points from the individual domains to a total score:\n$$S(P_J, P_S, P_A, P_D) = P_J + P_S + P_A + P_D$$\n\nNext, we must evaluate this function for the patient described by substituting the specific point values corresponding to the patient's clinical findings. The problem provides these values:\n\n1.  **Joint Involvement:** The patient has involvement of $10$ small joints. According to the provided criteria, this contributes $5$ points.\n    $$P_J = 5$$\n2.  **Serology:** The patient is high-positive for anti-CCP antibodies. This contributes $3$ points.\n    $$P_S = 3$$\n3.  **Acute-Phase Reactants:** The patient has an abnormal CRP. This contributes $1$ point.\n    $$P_A = 1$$\n4.  **Duration:** The symptom duration is greater than $6$ weeks. This contributes $1$ point.\n    $$P_D = 1$$\n\nSubstituting these numerical values into the symbolic scoring function yields the total score $S$ for this patient:\n$$S = 5 + 3 + 1 + 1$$\nPerforming the summation:\n$$S = 10$$\nThe total score for this patient, according to the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria as specified, is $10$. Within the context of the full classification system, a score of $6$ or greater is classified as definite rheumatoid arthritis. The calculated score of $10$ is consistent with a definitive classification.\nThe final answer is the exact numerical value of the total score.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "4447055"}, {"introduction": "In clinical practice, diagnostic reasoning is a dynamic process of updating belief in the presence of new evidence.

Let $D^c$ denote the complement event, that the patient does not have RA. Let $T^+$ denote the event that the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) test result is positive.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n1.  The pretest probability of RA, which is the prior probability of the disease, is $\\Pr(D) = 0.20$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease: $\\Pr(T^+ \\mid D) = 0.70$.\n3.  The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease: $\\Pr(T^- \\mid D^c) = 0.95$, where $T^-$ denotes a negative test result.\n\nThe goal is to calculate the posterior probability of the patient having RA given a positive test result, which is denoted as $\\Pr(D \\mid T^+)$. We will use Bayes' theorem for this calculation:\n$$ \\Pr(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{\\Pr(T^+ \\mid D) \\Pr(D)}{\\Pr(T^+)} $$\nThe numerator is a product of two given quantities:\n$$ \\Pr(T^+ \\mid D) \\Pr(D) = (0.70)(0.20) = 0.14 $$\nThis term, $\\Pr(T^+ \\mid D) \\Pr(D)$, also represents the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive, $\\Pr(D \\cap T^+)$.\n\nThe denominator, $\\Pr(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, which sums the probability of a positive test over all possible disease states (having the disease or not having the disease):\n$$ \\Pr(T^+) = \\Pr(T^+ \\mid D) \\Pr(D) + \\Pr(T^+ \\mid D^c) \\Pr(D^c) $$\nWe have the first term of this sum, $\\Pr(T^+ \\mid D) \\Pr(D) = 0.14$. We must now calculate the second term, $\\Pr(T^+ \\mid D^c) \\Pr(D^c)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the probability of not having the disease, $\\Pr(D^c)$, which is the complement of the prior probability $\\Pr(D)$:\n$$ \\Pr(D^c) = 1 - \\Pr(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 $$\nNext, we determine the probability of a positive test given the absence of disease, $\\Pr(T^+ \\mid D^c)$, which is also known as the false positive rate. This is the complement of the specificity, $\\Pr(T^- \\mid D^c)$:\n$$ \\Pr(T^+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - \\Pr(T^- \\mid D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\nNow we can compute the second term of the total probability expression:\n$$ \\Pr(T^+ \\mid D^c) \\Pr(D^c) = (0.05)(0.80) = 0.04 $$\nThis term represents the joint probability of not having the disease and testing positive, $\\Pr(D^c \\cap T^+)$.\n\nSubstituting the two terms back into the formula for the total probability $\\Pr(T^+)$:\n$$ \\Pr(T^+) = 0.14 + 0.04 = 0.18 $$\nFinally, we substitute the numerator and the denominator into Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability $\\Pr(D \\mid T^+)$:\n$$ \\Pr(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{0.14}{0.18} = \\frac{14}{18} = \\frac{7}{9} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\frac{7}{9} \\approx 0.777777... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.7778$.
