It is a standard, formalizable problem in clinical medicine.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe primary task is to derive an expression for the fractional excretion of urate, $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}}$, and compute its value.\n\nThe renal clearance of any substance $x$, denoted $C_x$, is defined as the rate of its excretion in urine divided by its concentration in plasma. The excretion rate is the product of the urine concentration of the substance, $U_x$, and the urine flow rate, $V$.\n$$\nC_x = \\frac{U_x \\cdot V}{P_x}\n$$\nwhere $P_x$ is the plasma concentration of substance $x$.\n\nApplying this definition to urate, its clearance, $C_{\\text{urate}}$, is given by:\n$$\nC_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{U_{\\text{urate}} \\cdot V}{P_{\\text{urate}}}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the clearance of creatinine, $C_{\\text{Cr}}$, which is used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), is given by:\n$$\nC_{\\text{Cr}} = \\frac{U_{\\text{Cr}} \\cdot V}{P_{\\text{Cr}}}\n$$\n\nThe problem defines the fractional excretion of urate, $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}}$, as the ratio of urate clearance to creatinine clearance:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{urate}}}{C_{\\text{Cr}}}\n$$\n\nWe now substitute the expressions for $C_{\\text{urate}}$ and $C_{\\text{Cr}}$ into the equation for $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{U_{\\text{urate}} \\cdot V}{P_{\\text{urate}}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{U_{\\text{Cr}} \\cdot V}{P_{\\text{Cr}}} \\right)}\n$$\n\nThe urine flow rate, $V$, is present in both the numerator and the denominator, allowing it to be canceled. This is a critical feature, as it permits the calculation of fractional excretion from spot urine and plasma samples without requiring a timed urine collection to measure $V$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{U_{\\text{urate}}}{P_{\\text{urate}}} \\cdot \\frac{P_{\\text{Cr}}}{U_{\\text{Cr}}}\n$$\nThis is the required general expression for the fractional excretion of urate in terms of the four given concentration measurements.\n\n### Computation\nNext, we compute the numerical value for $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}}$ using the provided data:\n- $U_{\\text{urate}} = 40 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n- $P_{\\text{urate}} = 8 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n- $U_{\\text{Cr}} = 100 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n- $P_{\\text{Cr}} = 1 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{40 \\text{ mg/dL}}{8 \\text{ mg/dL}} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\text{ mg/dL}}{100 \\text{ mg/dL}}\n$$\nThe units ($\\text{mg/dL}$) cancel, yielding a dimensionless quantity, as expected for a fractional ratio.\n$$\n\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{40}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1}{100} = 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{100} = 0.05\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $0.05$. To represent this with four significant figures, we write it as $0.05000$.\n\n### Clinical Interpretation\nFinally, we interpret this result in the context of gout pathophysiology. Hyperuricemia (elevated $P_{\\text{urate}}$) can result from two primary mechanisms: overproduction of urate or renal underexcretion of urate. The fractional excretion of urate helps differentiate these causes. The normal range for $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}}$ is typically cited as $6\\%$ to $10\\%$ (or $0.06$ to $0.10$). In a patient with hyperuricemia, an $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}}$ below a certain threshold (commonly $< 6\\%$ or $0.06$) is considered evidence of renal underexcretion as the predominant cause. The kidney is failing to excrete an adequate fraction of the filtered urate load, leading to its accumulation in the plasma.\n\nOur calculated value is $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}} = 0.05$, which corresponds to $5\\%$. Since $5\\% < 6\\%$, this result indicates that the patient is an \"underexcretor\" of urate. This finding is significant as underexcretion is the underlying cause of primary gout in approximately $90\\%$ of patients and can guide therapeutic choices, for instance, towards uricosuric agents which increase renal urate excretion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.05000}\n$$", "id": "4840641"}, {"introduction": "Building upon pathophysiologic assessment, this exercise challenges you to construct a complete, patient-centered therapeutic plan.

He denies any history of nephrolithiasis. Medications include losartan and atorvastatin. Examination confirms a firm subcutaneous tophus over the right olecranon.

The provided data, including serum urate, renal function, comorbid conditions (cardiovascular disease), and flare frequency, are consistent with established medical knowledge and epidemiology of gout. The request to use concepts like fractional excretion of urate ($FE_{\\text{urate}}$) and to consider comorbidities is central to modern, evidence-based gout management. The problem is scientifically and factually sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. Sufficient data are provided to formulate a comprehensive and rational treatment plan. The question asks for the \"best\" alignment with a principled algorithm, implying a comparative analysis of options against an optimal strategy derived from the data, which is a solvable task.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, clinical language, free from subjective or biased terminology.\n4.  **Completeness**: The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary information (gout severity, renal function, urate excretion data, cardiovascular comorbidity) to select and sequence urate-lowering therapies according to current guidelines and safety evidence.\n5.  **Consistency**: The data are internally consistent. A serum urate of $10.2$ mg/dL is severely elevated and consistent with the presence of tophi. An eGFR of $68\\,\\text{mL/min}/1.73\\,\\text{m}^2$ indicates chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage G2, a common finding in patients with gout. The medication list is appropriate for a patient with a history of myocardial infarction.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a realistic, scientifically grounded, and well-posed clinical problem that requires the application of fundamental principles in internal medicine and pharmacology.\n\n### Derivation of the Optimal Treatment Plan\n\n1.  **Indication for and Goal of ULT**: The patient has multiple strong indications for initiating ULT, including a palpable tophus, frequent flares ($\\ge 2$ per year; the patient has $4$), and a serum urate level well above the target range. Due to the presence of a tophus, the recommended target serum urate is $< 5.0$ mg/dL to promote dissolution of urate crystals.\n\n2.  **Assessment of Renal Urate Handling**: The fractional excretion of urate ($FE_{\\text{urate}}$) is calculated to determine if the patient is an underexcretor or overproducer of uric acid. The formula using a spot urine sample is:\n    $$FE_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{\\text{Urine Urate} \\times \\text{Serum Creatinine}}{\\text{Urine Creatinine} \\times \\text{Serum Urate}} \\times 100\\%$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$FE_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{60 \\, \\text{mg/dL} \\times 1.1 \\, \\text{mg/dL}}{220 \\, \\text{mg/dL} \\times 10.2 \\, \\text{mg/dL}} \\times 100\\%$$\n    $$FE_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{66}{2244} \\times 100\\% \\approx 0.02941 \\times 100\\% \\approx 2.94\\%$$\n    A value of $FE_{\\text{urate}} < 6\\%$ is the standard definition for renal underexcretion of urate. This patient is a clear underexcretor, which is the underlying cause of hyperuricemia in approximately $90\\%$ of patients with gout.\n\n3.  **First-Line ULT Selection**:\n    *   Current guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) strongly recommend a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) as first-line therapy, regardless of excretion status. The primary XOIs are allopurinol and febuxostat.\n    *   **Allopurinol vs. Febuxostat**: The patient has a history of myocardial infarction, which is significant established cardiovascular disease. The CARES trial demonstrated a higher risk of cardiovascular death with febuxostat compared to allopurinol in patients with established cardiovascular disease. Consequently, allopurinol is the preferred first-line XOI for this patient.\n    *   **Dosing**: Allopurinol should be initiated at a low dose, such as $100$ mg daily, and titrated upwards every $2$-$5$ weeks to achieve the serum urate target of $< 5.0$ mg/dL. The patient's eGFR of $68\\,\\text{mL/min}/1.73\\,\\text{m}^2$ does not warrant a starting dose lower than $100$ mg.\n    *   **Prophylaxis**: Initiation of ULT frequently precipitates gout flares. Therefore, concurrent anti-inflammatory prophylaxis (e.g., with colchicine, an NSAID, or a low-dose corticosteroid) is mandatory and should be continued for at least $3$-$6$ months.\n\n4.  **Second-Line ULT Strategy**: If the serum urate target is not met despite titration of allopurinol to a maximal tolerated or effective dose, a second agent is needed.\n    *   **Switching to Febuxostat**: This is a potential option but is not ideal given the cardiovascular safety concerns in this specific patient.\n    *   **Adding a Uricosuric Agent (e.g., probenecid)**: This is a highly logical and evidence-based choice for this patient.\n        *   **Mechanism**: The patient is an underexcretor ($FE_{\\text{urate}} \\approx 2.94\\%$), so adding an agent that promotes renal urate excretion is mechanistically complementary to the production-inhibiting effect of allopurinol.\n        *   **Efficacy**: Probenecid is effective in patients with preserved renal function (typically eGFR > $45$-$50$ mL/min/$1.73$ m$^2$). This patient's eGFR of $68\\,\\text{mL/min}/1.73\\,\\text{m}^2$ is well within the effective range.\n        *   **Safety**: The patient has no history of nephrolithiasis, which is a major contraindication to uricosuric therapy.\n        *   **Conclusion**: Adding probenecid to allopurinol is a safe, mechanistically sound, and effective second-line strategy that avoids the cardiovascular concerns associated with febuxostat.\n    *   **Pegloticase**: This is a recombinant uricase reserved for severe, refractory gout that has failed to respond to combination oral ULT. It is not an appropriate second-line therapy.\n\n5.  **Summary of Optimal Plan**:\n    *   **First-line**: Allopurinol, start at $100$ mg daily, titrate to a serum urate target of $< 5.0$ mg/dL, with concurrent anti-inflammatory prophylaxis.\n    *   **Second-line**: If the target is not achieved, add probenecid to the allopurinol regimen.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. First-line xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI; xanthine oxidase inhibitor) with allopurinol starting at $100$ mg daily and titrating by $100$ mg every $2$ to $4$ weeks to a treat-to-target serum urate, with anti-inflammatory flare prophylaxis; second-line add a uricosuric (probenecid $500$ mg twice daily) to the XOI rather than switching to febuxostat, given underexcretion, preserved renal function, and established cardiovascular disease.**\n*   **Analysis**: This option aligns perfectly with the derived optimal plan. The first-line therapy choice (allopurinol), starting dose, titration strategy, and inclusion of prophylaxis are all correct. The second-line strategy correctly identifies the patient's underexcretion status and preserved renal function as rationale for adding a uricosuric, and correctly cites the cardiovascular disease history as a reason to prefer this combination over switching to febuxostat.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. First-line febuxostat $40$–$80$ mg daily due to high baseline serum urate; second-line pegloticase after $3$ months if the target is not achieved.**\n*   **Analysis**: The first-line choice of febuxostat is suboptimal and potentially unsafe in this patient with established cardiovascular disease, despite it being a valid XOI. A high baseline serum urate is not a specific indication for febuxostat over allopurinol. The second-line choice of a premature escalation to pegloticase is inappropriate; combination oral therapy should be exhausted first.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. First-line probenecid $500$ mg twice daily as monotherapy because the patient is an underexcretor; second-line add hydrochlorothiazide $25$ mg daily to augment uricosuria.**\n*   **Analysis**: The first-line choice is incorrect; XOIs are the recommended first-line agents, not uricosurics. The second-line recommendation is pharmacologically dangerous and demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that *causes* hyperuricemia by inhibiting renal urate secretion; it would worsen the patient's condition.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. First-line allopurinol titrated to target; second-line switch to febuxostat if the serum urate remains above target despite adherence.**\n*   **Analysis**: The first-line therapy is correct. However, the second-line strategy is not optimal for this specific patient. While switching to febuxostat is a possible strategy, it ignores the patient's mechanistic profile (underexcretor) and cardiovascular risk profile, for which adding a uricosuric is a superior, safer, and more tailored approach. The question asks for the *best* rational plan.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. First-line pegloticase because tophi are present; second-line allopurinol after uricase-mediated debulking.**\n*   **Analysis**: This inverts the standard of care. Tophi are an indication for aggressive *oral* ULT, not for first-line biologic therapy. Pegloticase is a third-line agent for refractory disease.

This practice simulates this cornerstone of modern gout care by having you design a practical allopurinol titration schedule.
