It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to calculate the posterior probability of a patient having rheumatoid arthritis (RA) given a positive rheumatoid factor (RF) test result. This quantity is denoted as $P(\\text{RA} \\mid \\text{RF}^+)$. We will use Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$ P(\\text{RA} \\mid \\text{RF}^+) = \\frac{P(\\text{RF}^+ \\mid \\text{RA}) P(\\text{RA})}{P(\\text{RF}^+)} $$\nThe components of this formula are determined as follows.\n\n1.  **Prior Probability**: The prior probability of having RA is the prevalence in the specified patient cohort.\n    $$ P(\\text{RA}) = 0.10 $$\n\n2.  **Conditional Probability of a Positive Test Given Disease (Sensitivity)**: This is the sensitivity of the test, which is given.\n    $$ P(\\text{RF}^+ \\mid \\text{RA}) = 0.70 $$\n\n3.  **Total Probability of a Positive Test**: The denominator, $P(\\text{RF}^+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test in this patient cohort, regardless of disease status. It is calculated using the law of total probability:\n    $$ P(\\text{RF}^+) = P(\\text{RF}^+ \\mid \\text{RA}) P(\\text{RA}) + P(\\text{RF}^+ \\mid \\neg \\text{RA}) P(\\neg \\text{RA}) $$\n    To evaluate this expression, we need $P(\\neg \\text{RA})$ and $P(\\text{RF}^+ \\mid \\neg \\text{RA})$.\n\n    -   The probability of not having RA is the complement of the probability of having RA.\n        $$ P(\\neg \\text{RA}) = 1 - P(\\text{RA}) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 $$\n\n    -   The probability of a positive test given the absence of disease, $P(\\text{RF}^+ \\mid \\neg \\text{RA})$, is the false positive rate. It can be derived from the specificity. Specificity is the probability of a negative test in a patient without the disease, $P(\\text{RF}^- \\mid \\neg \\text{RA}) = 0.85$. Therefore, the false positive rate is:\n        $$ P(\\text{RF}^+ \\mid \\neg \\text{RA}) = 1 - P(\\text{RF}^- \\mid \\neg \\text{RA}) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15 $$\n\n    -   Now, we substitute these values into the law of total probability to find $P(\\text{RF}^+)$.\n        $$ P(\\text{RF}^+) = (0.70)(0.10) + (0.15)(0.90) $$\n        $$ P(\\text{RF}^+) = 0.070 + 0.135 $$\n        $$ P(\\text{RF}^+) = 0.205 $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Posterior Probability**: With all components assembled, we can now calculate the posterior probability $P(\\text{RA} \\mid \\text{RF}^+)$ using Bayes' theorem.\n    $$ P(\\text{RA} \\mid \\text{RF}^+) = \\frac{P(\\text{RF}^+ \\mid \\text{RA}) P(\\text{RA})}{P(\\text{RF}^+)} $$\n    $$ P(\\text{RA} \\mid \\text{RF}^+) = \\frac{(0.70)(0.10)}{0.205} $$\n    $$ P(\\text{RA} \\mid \\text{RF}^+) = \\frac{0.070}{0.205} $$\n    $$ P(\\text{RA} \\mid \\text{RF}^+) \\approx 0.3414634146... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures. Rounding the calculated value yields:\n$$ P(\\text{RA} \\mid \\text{RF}^+) \\approx 0.3415 $$\nThis is the positive predictive value of the RF test in this specific clinical context.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3415}$$", "id": "4827702"}, {"introduction": "While sensitivity and specificity are foundational, likelihood ratios (LRs) offer a more flexible and powerful way to interpret diagnostic tests in real time.

The diagnosis is now less certain but is far from being ruled out. The pathophysiological information provided in the problem statement explains why a normal serum urate does not exclude gout: the inflammatory process of the flare can increase urinary excretion of urate, transiently lowering the serum level.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\nA. A normal serum uric acid essentially rules out acute gout because the LR$^-$ is far below $1$, driving the post-test probability below $0.10$.\nThis is incorrect. The calculation shows the post-test probability is $\\approx 0.42$, not below $0.10$. A probability of $0.42$ is substantial and does not \"rule out\" the disease. A $LR^-$ of $0.31$ is only modestly effective at reducing probability, especially from a high pretest value. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nB. A normal serum uric acid modestly reduces, but does not eliminate, the probability of acute gout; with LR$^- = 0.31$ and a pretest probability of $0.70$, the post-test probability is approximately $0.42$, and the normal value is explained by transient kinetic lowering of serum urate during the flare.\nThis is correct. The calculation of the post-test probability to $\\approx 0.42$ is accurate. This represents a modest reduction from $0.70$, and it certainly does not eliminate gout as a possibility. The option also correctly incorporates the pathophysiological explanation for a normal serum urate level during an acute flare, as described in the problem statement. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nC. A normal serum uric acid increases the probability of gout because MSU crystallization lowers circulating urate; the post-test probability rises above $0.80$.\nThis is incorrect. A test result with a likelihood ratio less than $1$ (here, $LR^- = 0.31$) must, by definition, decrease the probability of the disease. The claim that the probability increases is a fundamental misunderstanding of Bayesian updating. The post-test probability falls to $\\approx 0.42$, not rises above $0.80$. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. A normal serum uric acid makes calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) more likely than gout; with LR$^- = 0.31$, the post-test probability for gout falls to around $0.05$, effectively excluding gout.\nThis is incorrect. The calculation is wrong; the post-test probability is $\\approx 0.42$, not $0.05$. Because the post-test probability of gout is still substantial at $0.42$, one cannot conclude that an alternative diagnosis like CPPD is now more likely without knowing its pretest probability and how it is affected by this test result. The statement \"effectively excluding gout\" is a false conclusion based on an incorrect calculation. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nE. Serum uric acid cannot be used in Bayesian updating because it is not a direct measure of crystals; therefore the probability remains at $0.70$ and the normal value is diagnostically neutral.\nThis is incorrect. Any diagnostic test for which performance characteristics like a likelihood ratio are known can be used in Bayesian updating. The fact that it is an indirect or imperfect measure is precisely what is captured by the likelihood ratio. A likelihood ratio of $1$ would be diagnostically neutral. The given $LR^-$ is $0.31$, which is not equal to $1$ and thus is not neutral; it provides new information that modifies the probability.
