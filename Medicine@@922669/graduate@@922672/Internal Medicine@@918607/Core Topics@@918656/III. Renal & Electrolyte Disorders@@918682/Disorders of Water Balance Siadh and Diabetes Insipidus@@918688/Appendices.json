Finally, compute the ratio of the free water clearance to the electrolyte-free water clearance for this patient. Express the final ratio as a pure number (no units). Round your final answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of two physiological quantities, the renal free water clearance ($C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$) and the electrolyte-free water clearance ($C_{\\mathrm{e-H_2O}}$), and then finding their ratio for a patient with Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH). The validation indicates the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all provided data are consistent with the described clinical condition.\n\nFirst, we address the renal free water clearance ($C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$). The fundamental principle of clearance states that the clearance of a substance $x$, denoted $C_x$, is the virtual volume of plasma completely cleared of that substance per unit time. It is calculated as:\n$$ C_x = \\frac{U_x \\times V}{P_x} $$\nwhere $U_x$ and $P_x$ are the concentrations of substance $x$ in urine and plasma, respectively, and $V$ is the urine flow rate.\n\nTo derive the free water clearance, we first consider the clearance of all osmotically active solutes, known as the osmolar clearance ($C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$). This represents the volume of plasma cleared of total osmoles per unit time. Applying the general clearance formula:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{osm}} = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{osm}} \\times V}{P_{\\mathrm{osm}}} $$\nwhere $U_{\\mathrm{osm}}$ is the urine osmolality, $P_{\\mathrm{osm}}$ is the plasma osmolality, and $V$ is the urine flow rate. The quantity $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$ represents the volume of urine that would be required to excrete the solute load at a concentration iso-osmotic to plasma.\n\nThe total urine flow rate, $V$, can be conceptually divided into two components: the volume needed to excrete the solutes in an iso-osmotic solution ($C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$) and the remaining volume of solute-free water ($C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$). Thus, we can write:\n$$ V = C_{\\mathrm{osm}} + C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} $$\nRearranging this equation gives the expression for free water clearance:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = V - C_{\\mathrm{osm}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$ yields the formula for $C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = V - \\left(\\frac{U_{\\mathrm{osm}} \\times V}{P_{\\mathrm{osm}}}\\right) = V \\left(1 - \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{osm}}}{P_{\\mathrm{osm}}}\\right) $$\nA positive $C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$ indicates excretion of free water (hypotonic urine), while a negative $C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$ indicates reabsorption of free water (hypertonic urine).\n\nNext, we derive the expression for electrolyte-free water clearance ($C_{\\mathrm{e-H_2O}}$). This concept refines the free water clearance by considering only the \"effective osmoles\"—primarily sodium ($\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$) and potassium ($\\mathrm{K}^{+}$) salts—that determine the distribution of water across cell membranes and thus regulate plasma tonicity. Ineffective osmoles, such as urea, are excluded. The excretion of effective urinary osmoles is primarily driven by the urinary concentrations of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$, so we use the sum $U_{\\mathrm{Na}} + U_{\\mathrm{K}}$ to quantify this. The corresponding plasma concentration that determines tonicity is the plasma sodium concentration, $P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$.\n\nAnalogous to osmolar clearance, we can define an \"electrolyte clearance\" ($C_{\\mathrm{elec}}$) as the virtual volume of plasma (with tonicity set by $P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$) cleared of the major cations per unit time:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{elec}} = \\frac{(U_{\\mathrm{Na}} + U_{\\mathrm{K}}) \\times V}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}}} $$\nThe total urine flow rate $V$ is then the sum of this electrolyte clearance and the electrolyte-free water clearance, $C_{\\mathrm{e-H_2O}}$:\n$$ V = C_{\\mathrm{elec}} + C_{\\mathrm{e-H_2O}} $$\nSolving for $C_{\\mathrm{e-H_2O}}$ gives:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{e-H_2O}} = V - C_{\\mathrm{elec}} = V - \\left(\\frac{(U_{\\mathrm{Na}} + U_{\\mathrm{K}}) \\times V}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}}}\\right) = V \\left(1 - \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{Na}} + U_{\\mathrm{K}}}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}}}\\right) $$\nA negative $C_{\\mathrm{e-H_2O}}$ implies that the kidneys are excreting urine with a higher effective osmolality (tonicity) than plasma, leading to retention of electrolyte-free water and a decrease in plasma sodium concentration.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the free water clearance to the electrolyte-free water clearance. Using the derived expressions:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}{C_{\\mathrm{e-H_2O}}} = \\frac{V \\left(1 - \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{osm}}}{P_{\\mathrm{osm}}}\\right)}{V \\left(1 - \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{Na}} + U_{\\mathrm{K}}}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}}}\\right)} $$\nThe urine flow rate, $V$, cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{osm}}}{P_{\\mathrm{osm}}}}{1 - \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{Na}} + U_{\\mathrm{K}}}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}}}} $$\nWe can now substitute the given values into this expression:\n- $U_{\\mathrm{osm}} = 780$ mOsm/kg $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$\n- $P_{\\mathrm{osm}} = 252$ mOsm/kg $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$\n- $U_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 110$ mEq/L\n- $U_{\\mathrm{K}} = 25$ mEq/L\n- $P_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 118$ mEq/L\n\nCalculating the terms in the numerator and denominator:\nThe numerator term is:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{osm}}}{P_{\\mathrm{osm}}} = 1 - \\frac{780}{252} \\approx 1 - 3.095238 = -2.095238 $$\nThe denominator term is:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{Na}} + U_{\\mathrm{K}}}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}}} = 1 - \\frac{110 + 25}{118} = 1 - \\frac{135}{118} \\approx 1 - 1.144068 = -0.144068 $$\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{-2.095238...}{-0.144068...} \\approx 14.543478... $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $14.54$. The large value of this ratio highlights the significant contribution of non-electrolyte osmoles (primarily urea) to the total urine osmolality in SIADH, and illustrates why electrolyte-free water clearance is a more accurate predictor of changes in plasma sodium than the traditional free water clearance.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{14.54}$$", "id": "4830044"}, {"introduction": "In clinical practice, a low serum sodium measurement does not automatically equate to a hypotonic state, which is the hallmark of SIADH. Complex patients often present with multiple confounding factors that can create hypertonic or isotonic hyponatremia, where treating with fluid restriction could be ineffective or harmful.

It is not unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A detailed solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to compute the effective plasma osmolality, also known as tonicity. By definition, this is the sum of the concentrations of all effective osmoles, which are solutes that do not freely cross cell membranes and thus exert an osmotic force that drives water movement. The problem explicitly states that urea and ethanol are to be considered ineffective osmoles. Therefore, the effective osmoles in this patient are sodium salts, glucose, and mannitol.\n\nThe effective osmolality, denoted $O_{eff}$, is given by the sum of the osmolal contributions of these solutes:\n$$ O_{eff} = O_{\\text{sodium salts}} + O_{\\text{glucose}} + O_{\\text{mannitol}} $$\n\nWe will calculate the contribution of each component from first principles, using the provided data. The assumption that plasma density is $1 \\ \\mathrm{kg/L}$ allows for the direct conversion between molar concentration in $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$ and osmolality in $\\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$ of water.\n\n**1. Contribution of Sodium Salts ($O_{\\text{sodium salts}}$)**\n\nThe serum sodium concentration is given as $[\\text{Na}^+] = 120 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$. According to the principle of electroneutrality and the assumption of complete dissociation of salts, each sodium cation is associated with an anion (e.g., chloride, bicarbonate). Thus, each mole of a sodium salt like $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ dissociates into two osmoles. The contribution of sodium and its accompanying anions to osmolality is therefore approximately twice the sodium concentration.\n\n$$ O_{\\text{sodium salts}} = 2 \\times [\\text{Na}^+] $$\n$$ O_{\\text{sodium salts}} = 2 \\times 120 \\ \\mathrm{mOsm/kg} = 240 \\ \\mathrm{mOsm/kg} $$\n\n**2. Contribution of Glucose ($O_{\\text{glucose}}$)**\n\nThe plasma glucose concentration is given as $C_{\\text{glucose}} = 540 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$. The molecular weight of glucose is $M_{\\text{glucose}} = 180 \\ \\mathrm{g/mol}$. First, we convert the mass concentration to molar concentration.\n\nConvert concentration from $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ to $\\mathrm{g/L}$:\n$$ 540 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{dL}} \\times \\frac{10 \\ \\mathrm{dL}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{1 \\ \\mathrm{g}}{1000 \\ \\mathrm{mg}} = 5.4 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{L}} $$\n\nCalculate the molar concentration in $\\mathrm{mol/L}$:\n$$ \\text{Molarity}_{\\text{glucose}} = \\frac{\\text{Concentration in g/L}}{M_{\\text{glucose}}} = \\frac{5.4 \\ \\mathrm{g/L}}{180 \\ \\mathrm{g/mol}} = 0.03 \\ \\mathrm{mol/L} $$\n\nConvert molarity to $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$:\n$$ 0.03 \\ \\mathrm{mol/L} \\times \\frac{1000 \\ \\mathrm{mmol}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{mol}} = 30 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} $$\n\nSince glucose does not dissociate, each molecule contributes one osmole. Given the plasma density assumption, its osmolal contribution is:\n$$ O_{\\text{glucose}} = 30 \\ \\mathrm{mOsm/kg} $$\n\n**3. Contribution of Mannitol ($O_{\\text{mannitol}}$)**\n\nThe plasma mannitol concentration is $C_{\\text{mannitol}} = 650 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$. The molecular weight of mannitol is $M_{\\text{mannitol}} = 182 \\ \\mathrm{g/mol}$. We follow the same procedure as for glucose.\n\nConvert concentration from $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ to $\\mathrm{g/L}$:\n$$ 650 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{dL}} \\times \\frac{10 \\ \\mathrm{dL}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{1 \\ \\mathrm{g}}{1000 \\ \\mathrm{mg}} = 6.5 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{L}} $$\n\nCalculate the molar concentration in $\\mathrm{mol/L}$:\n$$ \\text{Molarity}_{\\text{mannitol}} = \\frac{\\text{Concentration in g/L}}{M_{\\text{mannitol}}} = \\frac{6.5 \\ \\mathrm{g/L}}{182 \\ \\mathrm{g/mol}} \\approx 0.03571428... \\ \\mathrm{mol/L} $$\n\nConvert molarity to $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$:\n$$ 0.03571428... \\ \\mathrm{mol/L} \\times \\frac{1000 \\ \\mathrm{mmol}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{mol}} \\approx 35.71428... \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} $$\n\nLike glucose, mannitol does not dissociate. Its osmolal contribution is:\n$$ O_{\\text{mannitol}} \\approx 35.71428... \\ \\mathrm{mOsm/kg} $$\n\n**4. Total Effective Osmolality ($O_{eff}$)**\n\nFinally, we sum the contributions from all effective osmoles:\n\n$$ O_{eff} = O_{\\text{sodium salts}} + O_{\\text{glucose}} + O_{\\text{mannitol}} $$\n$$ O_{eff} = 240 \\ \\mathrm{mOsm/kg} + 30 \\ \\mathrm{mOsm/kg} + 35.71428... \\ \\mathrm{mOsm/kg} $$\n$$ O_{eff} = 305.71428... \\ \\mathrm{mOsm/kg} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n\n$$ O_{eff} \\approx 305.7 \\ \\mathrm{mOsm/kg} $$\n\nThis value represents the tonicity of the patient's plasma. Despite the measured hyponatremia (low sodium), the effective osmolality is elevated above the normal range (typically $275-295 \\ \\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$), primarily due to the severe hyperglycemia and the presence of mannitol.
