Starting from the following fundamental base:\n\n- Water movement across cell membranes occurs to equilibrate effective osmolality (tonicity) between the intracellular fluid (ICF) and the extracellular fluid (ECF).\n- Sodium is the dominant extracellular effective osmole under usual conditions, while markedly elevated glucose acts as an additional effective extracellular osmole that transiently increases $ECF$ tonicity and draws water from the $ICF$ into the $ECF$, diluting $[Na]_{\\text{serum}}$.\n- The standard reference for normoglycemia in this context is $G_{\\text{reference}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n\nUse these facts to reason about how hyperglycemia leads to translocational hyponatremia and compute the corrected serum sodium concentration $[Na]_{\\text{serum,corrected}}$ that estimates what the serum sodium would be if the glucose were at $G_{\\text{reference}}$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of osmotic fluid shifts, specifically describing translocational hyponatremia due to hyperglycemia, a well-established concept in physiology and internal medicine. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and clear instructions for a unique, computable solution. The language is objective and the values provided are clinically realistic.\n\nThe core principle underlying this problem is the regulation of water balance between the intracellular fluid (ICF) and extracellular fluid (ECF) compartments, which is governed by tonicity. Tonicity is determined by the concentration of effective osmoles—solutes that do not freely permeate cell membranes and thus exert an osmotic pressure. Under normal physiological conditions, sodium salts are the primary determinant of ECF tonicity.\n\nIn severe hyperglycemia, glucose, which is normally confined to the ECF until it is transported into cells via insulin-dependent mechanisms, accumulates in the ECF at a high concentration. When insulin is deficient or ineffective, this high extracellular glucose concentration increases the tonicity of the ECF. This creates an osmotic gradient that drives the net movement of water from the ICF into the ECF. The influx of water expands the ECF volume and, consequently, dilutes the solutes within it. Since sodium is the principal ECF cation, its concentration, $[Na]_{\\text{serum}}$, decreases. This phenomenon is termed translocational or hypertonic hyponatremia.\n\nThe task is to compute a corrected serum sodium concentration, $[Na]_{\\text{serum,corrected}}$, which estimates what the serum sodium would be if the patient's serum glucose were at a normal reference level. This correction is essential for assessing the true sodium and water balance status of the patient, as the measured hyponatremia may mask an underlying state of normal or even elevated total body sodium relative to water (hypernatremia).\n\nThe general formula for this correction is:\n$$[Na]_{\\text{serum,corrected}} = [Na]_{\\text{serum,measured}} + \\Delta[Na]$$\nwhere $\\Delta[Na]$ represents the calculated decrease in serum sodium concentration caused by the hyperglycemic state.\n\nThe problem provides an empirical method to calculate this adjustment. The correction is proportional to the extent of hyperglycemia, defined as the increase in serum glucose concentration above a reference value. Let the measured glucose be $G_{\\text{measured}}$, the reference glucose be $G_{\\text{reference}}$, and the empirical correction coefficient be $C$. The coefficient $C$ is given in units of $\\mathrm{mEq/L}$ of sodium correction for every $100\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$ increment in glucose.\n\nFirst, we determine the excess glucose concentration in increments of $100\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$:\n$$\\text{Glucose increment factor} = \\frac{G_{\\text{measured}} - G_{\\text{reference}}}{100}$$\n\nThe total sodium correction, $\\Delta[Na]$, is the product of this factor and the correction coefficient $C$:\n$$\\Delta[Na] = C \\times \\left( \\frac{G_{\\text{measured}} - G_{\\text{reference}}}{100} \\right)$$\n\nTherefore, the complete formula for the corrected sodium concentration is:\n$$[Na]_{\\text{serum,corrected}} = [Na]_{\\text{serum,measured}} + C \\times \\left( \\frac{G_{\\text{measured}} - G_{\\text{reference}}}{100} \\right)$$\n\nThe given values are:\n- Measured serum sodium, $[Na]_{\\text{serum,measured}} = 124\\ \\mathrm{mEq/L}$.\n- Measured serum glucose, $G_{\\text{measured}} = 600\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n- Reference serum glucose, $G_{\\text{reference}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the glucose increment factor:\n$$\\frac{600 - 100}{100} = \\frac{500}{100} = 5$$\nThis indicates the serum glucose is elevated by $5$ increments of $100\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$ above the reference level.\n\nNow, we compute the corrected sodium for each of the two provided coefficients.\n\nCase 1: Correction coefficient $C_1 = 1.6\\ \\mathrm{mEq/L}$ per $100\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\nLet the corrected sodium for this case be $[Na]_{\\text{serum,corrected,1}}$.\n$$[Na]_{\\text{serum,corrected,1}} = 124 + 1.6 \\times 5$$\n$$[Na]_{\\text{serum,corrected,1}} = 124 + 8.0$$\n$$[Na]_{\\text{serum,corrected,1}} = 132.0\\ \\mathrm{mEq/L}$$\nThe value $132.0$ has four significant figures as required.\n\nCase 2: Correction coefficient $C_2 = 2.4\\ \\mathrm{mEq/L}$ per $100\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\nLet the corrected sodium for this case be $[Na]_{\\text{serum,corrected,2}}$.\n$$[Na]_{\\text{serum,corrected,2}} = 124 + 2.4 \\times 5$$\n$$[Na]_{\\text{serum,corrected,2}} = 124 + 12.0$$\n$$[Na]_{\\text{serum,corrected,2}} = 136.0\\ \\mathrm{mEq/L}$$\nThe value $136.0$ also has four significant figures.\n\nThe two computed values for the corrected serum sodium concentration are $132.0\\ \\mathrm{mEq/L}$ and $136.0\\ \\mathrm{mEq/L}$.

There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains a complete and consistent set of information. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Justification of Diuresis Type**\n\nThe patient presents with hypernatremia, indicated by a serum sodium concentration $[ \\mathrm{Na} ]_{\\mathrm{serum}} = 160\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}$. Hypernatremia implies a state of hyperosmolality of the plasma. The normal physiological response to hyperosmolality is the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which acts on the renal collecting ducts to increase water reabsorption. This compensatory mechanism should lead to the excretion of a minimal volume of maximally concentrated urine, with a urine osmolality ($U_{\\mathrm{Osm}}$) typically exceeding $800\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$.\n\nThe patient, however, has polyuria (high urine output) and a urine osmolality of $U_{\\mathrm{Osm}} = 200\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$. This urine is hypoosmotic relative to normal plasma (which has an osmolality of approximately $2 \\times [ \\mathrm{Na} ]_{\\mathrm{serum}} \\approx 2 \\times 160 = 320\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$), and it is inappropriately dilute given the stimulus of hypernatremia.\n\nWe can distinguish between two types of diuresis:\n1.  **Water Diuresis:** This is caused by the excretion of a large volume of electrolyte-free water. It results in dilute urine, with $U_{\\mathrm{Osm}}$ typically less than $250\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$, and often below $100\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$. It indicates impaired water reabsorption by the kidneys, usually due to insufficient ADH production (central diabetes insipidus) or renal resistance to ADH (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus).\n2.  **Osmotic Diuresis:** This is caused by an increased excretion of solutes (e.g., glucose, urea, mannitol) that are poorly reabsorbed by the renal tubules. These solutes osmotically retain water in the tubules, leading to polyuria. In this case, the urine is not maximally dilute; the $U_{\\mathrm{Osm}}$ is typically greater than that of plasma ($ 300\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$) or at least isosmotic.\n\nGiven that the patient has a $U_{\\mathrm{Osm}}$ of $200\\,\\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$ in the setting of significant hypernatremia, the kidneys are failing to conserve water. The excretion of large volumes of inappropriately dilute urine is the defining characteristic of water diuresis. Therefore, the clinical picture is most consistent with water diuresis.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation and Calculation of Free Water Deficit**\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation from first principles. The fundamental principle is that plasma sodium concentration, $[ \\mathrm{Na} ]$, is proportional to the ratio of the total effective body solute, $S_{body}$, to the total body water, $\\text{TBW}$.\n\n$$[ \\mathrm{Na} ] \\approx \\frac{S_{body}}{\\text{TBW}}$$\n\nAt the initial state, the patient has a sodium concentration $[ \\mathrm{Na} ]_i$ and a total body water volume $\\text{TBW}_i$.\n$$[ \\mathrm{Na} ]_i = \\frac{S_{body}}{\\text{TBW}_i}$$\n\nFrom this, the total body solute can be expressed as:\n$$S_{body} = [ \\mathrm{Na} ]_i \\times \\text{TBW}_i$$\n\nThe goal is to correct the sodium concentration to a final value, $[ \\mathrm{Na} ]_f$, by administering a volume of electrolyte-free water, which we define as the free water deficit, $\\text{FWD}$. This added water will increase the total body water to a new volume, $\\text{TBW}_f$.\n$$\\text{TBW}_f = \\text{TBW}_i + \\text{FWD}$$\n\nThe problem states that the total body solute, $S_{body}$, is to be considered constant during this acute correction. Therefore, at the final state:\n$$[ \\mathrm{Na} ]_f = \\frac{S_{body}}{\\text{TBW}_f} = \\frac{S_{body}}{\\text{TBW}_i + \\text{FWD}}$$\n\nSince $S_{body}$ is conserved, we can equate the expressions for $S_{body}$ from the initial and final states:\n$$[ \\mathrm{Na} ]_i \\times \\text{TBW}_i = [ \\mathrm{Na} ]_f \\times \\text{TBW}_f$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\text{TBW}_f$:\n$$[ \\mathrm{Na} ]_i \\times \\text{TBW}_i = [ \\mathrm{Na} ]_f \\times (\\text{TBW}_i + \\text{FWD})$$\n\nWe now solve this equation for $\\text{FWD}$ to complete the derivation.\n$$\\frac{[ \\mathrm{Na} ]_i}{[ \\mathrm{Na} ]_f} \\times \\text{TBW}_i = \\text{TBW}_i + \\text{FWD}$$\n$$\\text{FWD} = \\left( \\frac{[ \\mathrm{Na} ]_i}{[ \\mathrm{Na} ]_f} \\right) \\text{TBW}_i - \\text{TBW}_i$$\n\nFactoring out $\\text{TBW}_i$ yields the final expression for the free water deficit:\n$$\\text{FWD} = \\text{TBW}_i \\left( \\frac{[ \\mathrm{Na} ]_i}{[ \\mathrm{Na} ]_f} - 1 \\right)$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n- $[ \\mathrm{Na} ]_i = 160\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}$\n- $[ \\mathrm{Na} ]_f = 140\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}$\n- $\\text{TBW}_i = 42\\,\\mathrm{L}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\\text{FWD} = 42\\,\\mathrm{L} \\left( \\frac{160\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}}{140\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}} - 1 \\right)$$\n$$\\text{FWD} = 42 \\left( \\frac{16}{14} - 1 \\right)\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\n$$\\text{FWD} = 42 \\left( \\frac{8}{7} - \\frac{7}{7} \\right)\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\n$$\\text{FWD} = 42 \\left( \\frac{1}{7} \\right)\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\n$$\\text{FWD} = 6\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\n\nThe result is exactly $6\\,\\mathrm{L}$.

The closed-system calculation assumes no urinary output. Diuresis represents an output of both water and solutes (primarily sodium and potassium). The effect of this output on serum sodium concentration depends entirely on the electrolyte concentration of the lost fluid (urine) relative to the patient's serum sodium concentration. The serum sodium concentration is fundamentally a ratio of total exchangeable cations (sodium plus potassium, $Na_e + K_e$) to total body water (TBW).\n\nLet the concentration of sodium and potassium in the urine be $\\left[\\mathrm{Na+K}\\right]_{\\text{urine}}$.\n1.  **Water Diuresis**: This refers to the excretion of a large volume of dilute urine, where $\\left[\\mathrm{Na+K}\\right]_{\\text{urine}}$ is very low, i.e., significantly lower than the patient's serum sodium concentration $\\left[\\mathrm{Na}\\right]_{\\text{serum}}$. This constitutes a hypotonic fluid loss. The loss of water is proportionally much greater than the loss of sodium. Removing excess water from the TBW compartment will further concentrate the body's sodium, leading to a *greater* increase in serum sodium than was calculated in the closed-system model.\n\n2.  **Osmotic Diuresis**: In this process, non-reabsorbed solutes (e.g., glucose, mannitol) obligate the excretion of water and electrolytes. The electrolyte concentration of the urine, $\\left[\\mathrm{Na+K}\\right]_{\\text{urine}}$, can be variable.\n    - If the excreted fluid is hypotonic relative to plasma (i.e., $\\left[\\mathrm{Na+K}\\right]_{\\text{urine}}  \\left[\\mathrm{Na}\\right]_{\\text{serum}}$), its loss will raise the serum sodium concentration, augmenting the effect of the hypertonic saline. This is a common scenario.\n    - If the excreted fluid is isotonic ($\\left[\\mathrm{Na+K}\\right]_{\\text{urine}} \\approx \\left[\\mathrm{Na}\\right]_{\\text{serum}}$), its loss will not directly change the serum sodium concentration, but it will reduce the TBW, affecting subsequent calculations.\n    - If the excreted fluid is hypertonic ($\\left[\\mathrm{Na+K}\\right]_{\\text{urine}}  \\left[\\mathrm{Na}\\right]_{\\text{serum}}$), its loss will lower the serum sodium concentration, thereby counteracting or blunting the therapeutic effect of the hypertonic saline. This would lead to a *smaller* increase in serum sodium than calculated.\n\nIn summary, any ongoing urinary losses must be accounted for by analyzing the tonicity of the urine. A hypotonic urinary loss (as in water diuresis or typical osmotic diuresis) will accelerate the rate of correction of hyponatremia, whereas a hypertonic urinary loss would impede it.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.67}$$", "id": "4829525"}]}
