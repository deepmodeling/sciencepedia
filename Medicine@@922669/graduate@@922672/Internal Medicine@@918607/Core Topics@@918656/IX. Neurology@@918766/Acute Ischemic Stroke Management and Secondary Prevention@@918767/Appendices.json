The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is an essential tool for quantifying the extent of early ischemic changes on non-contrast CT scans, providing a standardized basis for risk stratification. This practice challenges you to calculate a patient's ASPECTS from a clinical description, a core skill that directly influences the risk-benefit assessment for both intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy [@problem_id:4786212].", "problem": "A $68$-year-old right-handed patient presents with acute left hemispheric symptoms: right face and arm weakness, aphasia, and gaze deviation. The last known well time is $120$ minutes prior to arrival. Vital signs are stable and serum glucose is $5.2$ mmol/L. A non-contrast Computed Tomography (CT) of the head demonstrates early ischemic changes characterized by clear hypodensity in the insular cortex, the caudate head, and one middle cerebral artery cortical region corresponding anatomically to the area designated as $M2$; there is no visible hypodensity in the lentiform nucleus, internal capsule, insular-marginal regions beyond the insula itself, or any other cortical middle cerebral artery territories. There is no hemorrhage. Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) shows a distal middle cerebral artery branch occlusion consistent with an $M2$ segment lesion.\n\nUsing the Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS), compute the patient’s score based on the described CT findings. Then, reason from the foundational definitions of ASPECTS and established clinical principles relating ASPECTS to early ischemic change burden, risk of hemorrhagic transformation, and potential benefit of reperfusion therapies to interpret how this score would influence the risk-benefit considerations for Intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rt-PA) and for endovascular mechanical thrombectomy in the early time window. Express the final answer as the single ASPECTS score. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a clinically realistic scenario of an acute ischemic stroke and asks for the calculation and interpretation of a standardized, quantifiable score based on specific, objectively described radiological findings. The data are self-contained and consistent, and the problem is formalizable within the established principles of stroke neurology and neuroradiology.\n\nThe Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS) is a $10$-point scoring system used to quantify the extent of early ischemic changes on a non-contrast Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the brain in patients with acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic stroke. A completely normal scan receives a score of $10$. For each of the $10$ predefined regions within the MCA territory that shows evidence of early ischemic change (such as hypodensity or loss of grey-white matter differentiation), one point is subtracted from the initial score of $10$.\n\nThe $10$ regions are divided into deep subcortical and cortical structures:\n1.  **Deep (Subcortical) Regions:**\n    *   Caudate nucleus (head) (C)\n    *   Lentiform nucleus (L)\n    *   Internal capsule (IC)\n2.  **Cortical Regions:**\n    *   Insular cortex (I)\n    *   $M1$: Anterior MCA cortex\n    *   $M2$: MCA cortex lateral to the insular ribbon\n    *   $M3$: Posterior MCA cortex\n    *   $M4$, $M5$, $M6$: Anterior, lateral, and posterior MCA territories at a level superior to $M1$-$M3$, rostral to the basal ganglia.\n\nThe problem states that the patient's non-contrast CT shows early ischemic changes characterized by clear hypodensity in the following regions:\n*   The insular cortex (I)\n*   The caudate head (C)\n*   One middle cerebral artery cortical region corresponding anatomically to the area designated as $M2$.\n\nThe problem explicitly states there is no visible hypodensity in the lentiform nucleus (L), internal capsule (IC), or any other cortical MCA territories.\n\nTo calculate the ASPECTS, we start with a perfect score of $10$ and subtract one point for each affected region.\nThe total number of affected regions is three: the insular cortex (I), the caudate head (C), and the $M2$ cortical region.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is:\n$$ \\text{ASPECTS} = 10 - (\\text{points for affected regions}) $$\n$$ \\text{ASPECTS} = 10 - (1_{\\text{I}} + 1_{\\text{C}} + 1_{M2}) $$\n$$ \\text{ASPECTS} = 10 - 3 = 7 $$\n\nThe patient's ASPECTS is $7$.\n\nThe interpretation of this score in the context of treatment decisions is as follows:\nThe patient's last known well time was $120$ minutes prior to arrival, placing them well within the standard $4.5$-hour window for intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rt-PA). The ASPECTS provides a quantitative measure of the ischemic burden, which correlates with the risk of hemorrhagic transformation and the likelihood of a good functional outcome after reperfusion.\n\nA lower ASPECTS signifies a larger volume of established infarction, which increases the risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) post-thrombolysis and is associated with poorer functional outcomes. An ASPECTS of $7$ indicates a moderate-sized infarct core. Historically, very large areas of early ischemic change (e.g., involving more than one-third of the MCA territory, which roughly corresponds to an ASPECTS score below $7$) were considered a relative contraindication to IV rt-PA. However, extensive analysis of trial data has shown that patients with an ASPECTS of $5$ or $6$ can still benefit from thrombolysis, although the risk of sICH is higher. For an ASPECTS of $7$, the benefit of IV rt-PA in an eligible patient is well-established and clearly outweighs the associated risks. Thus, the score strongly supports the decision to administer IV rt-PA.\n\nRegarding endovascular mechanical thrombectomy (EVT), the patient's CT Angiography (CTA) shows a distal MCA branch occlusion in the $M2$ segment. The seminal randomized controlled trials establishing the efficacy of EVT primarily enrolled patients with large vessel occlusions (LVOs) of the internal carotid artery or the proximal ($M1$) segment of the MCA. The benefit of EVT for more distal occlusions such as in the $M2$ segment is an area of active investigation and is considered on a case-by-case basis. However, the ASPECTS itself is a critical factor in selecting candidates for EVT. The major EVT trials used an ASPECTS $\\ge 6$ as a key inclusion criterion. A score of $7$ indicates that the established infarct core is not extensive and that a significant volume of brain tissue (the ischemic penumbra) is potentially salvageable with successful and rapid reperfusion. Therefore, the ASPECTS of $7$ is favorable and would support consideration for EVT, should it be deemed technically feasible and clinically appropriate for an $M2$ occlusion at the treating center. The score does not represent a contraindication; on the contrary, it suggests a good potential for favorable outcome if reperfusion is achieved.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "4786212"}, {"introduction": "For patients eligible for reperfusion, the administration of intravenous alteplase is a time-critical and high-stakes intervention.

In evidence-based practice, the dosing strategy is weight-proportional but constrained by a safety cap and divided into an initial bolus followed by an infusion. Derive an expression for the total administered dose as a function of body weight based on the following well-tested clinical facts: the regimen uses a weight-based dose per kilogram, it is bounded above by a fixed maximum total dose, and administration is split into a fixed bolus fraction and a fixed infusion fraction delivered uniformly over a fixed time interval.

The actual total dose administered, $D_{total}(w)$, is therefore the lesser of the calculated weight-proportional dose and the maximum dose. This relationship is precisely captured by the minimum operator:\n$$D_{total}(w) = \\min(D_{prop}(w), D_{\\max}) = \\min(d \\cdot w, D_{\\max})$$\nThis expression represents the general formula for the total administered dose as a function of body weight.\n\nThe total dose is partitioned into two components: an initial bolus and a sustained infusion.

When a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) or stroke is attributed to extracranial atherosclerosis, quantifying the degree of carotid stenosis is critical for guiding decisions about revascularization.

It presents a realistic clinical scenario requiring the application of a standard-of-care diagnostic formula.\n\nThe first step is to compute the degree of carotid stenosis using the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) method. The NASCET definition calculates stenosis as the percentage reduction in diameter from a normal distal segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA) to the point of maximal narrowing.\n\nLet $D_{\\text{distal}}$ be the diameter of the radiographically normal distal ICA, and let $D_{\\text{stenosis}}$ be the minimal luminal diameter at the point of stenosis.

According to major clinical guidelines (e.g., from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association), symptomatic patients are categorized based on stenosis severity:\n    -   **Severe Stenosis ($70\\%$ to $99\\%$):** Carotid revascularization (CEA or stenting) is strongly recommended, as it provides a clear and substantial benefit in reducing future stroke risk compared to medical therapy alone.\n    -   **Moderate Stenosis ($50\\%$ to $69\\%$):** Carotid revascularization is also recommended for most patients in this category, although the absolute benefit is more modest than for severe stenosis. The benefit is greatest in men, for those treated within $14$ days of the last symptom, and when the perioperative risk is low.\n    -   **Mild Stenosis ($50\\%$):** Medical management is superior to revascularization.\n3.  **Patient-Specific Factors**: The calculated stenosis of $\\approx 67\\%$ places this patient in the moderate stenosis category. The patient is a symptomatic male with recent events (within $7$ days), and his estimated perioperative stroke or death risk is below $6\\%$ (given as $0.06$), which is the generally accepted threshold for low risk in this context. These factors align with the sub-group that derives the most benefit from intervention in the $50\\%-69\\%$ stenosis range.\n\n**Conclusion on Candidacy**: Given the symptomatic status, the moderate degree of stenosis ($\\approx 67\\%$), the recent nature of the symptoms, and the acceptable perioperative risk, the patient is a clear candidate for carotid revascularization, specifically CEA as mentioned in the prompt. The procedure is most effective when performed within $2$ weeks of the index event.
