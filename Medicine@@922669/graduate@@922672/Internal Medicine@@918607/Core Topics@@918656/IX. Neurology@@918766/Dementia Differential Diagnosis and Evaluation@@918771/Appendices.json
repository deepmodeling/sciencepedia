The solution must be derived from fundamental principles.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant events and notations based on the problem statement:\n- Let $D$ be the event that the patient has Alzheimer disease.\n- Let $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have Alzheimer disease.\n- Let $A^+$ be the event of a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta ($A\\beta$) biomarker.\n- Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive CSF tau biomarker.\n- The evidence we have observed is the conjunction of the two positive tests, denoted as $E = A^+ \\cap T^+$.\n\nThe information provided in the problem can be stated as:\n- The pre-test probability of Alzheimer disease: $P(D) = 0.40$.\n- The pre-test probability of not having Alzheimer disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$.\n- The positive likelihood ratio for the $A\\beta$ test is $LR_A^+ = \\frac{P(A^+|D)}{P(A^+|D^c)} = 5$.\n- The positive likelihood ratio for the tau test is $LR_T^+ = \\frac{P(T^+|D)}{P(T^+|D^c)} = 4$.\n- The two biomarkers are conditionally independent given the disease status.

The post-test probability $P(D|E)$ is given by Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nP(D|E) = \\frac{P(E|D)P(D)}{P(E)}\n$$\nTo facilitate the use of likelihood ratios, we work with odds instead of probabilities.
