The parameters described—Age, Blood pressure, Clinical features, Duration of symptoms, and presence of Diabetes—uniquely identify the ABCD2 scoring system.\n\nThe ABCD2 score is calculated by summing the points assigned to each of its five components:\n\n1.  **A**ge: $1$ point is assigned if age is $\\ge 60$ years.\n    The patient's age is $72$ years.

This duration falls within the $10-59$ minute range. This component contributes $1$ point.\n\n5.  **D**iabetes: $1$ point is assigned for a history of diabetes mellitus.\n    The patient has a history of type $2$ diabetes mellitus. This component contributes $1$ point.\n\nThe total ABCD2 score is the sum of the points from each component:\n$$ \\text{Total Score} = (\\text{Age}) + (\\text{Blood Pressure}) + (\\text{Clinical Features}) + (\\text{Duration}) + (\\text{Diabetes}) $$\n$$ \\text{Total Score} = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6 $$\n\nAccording to the standard interpretation of the ABCD2 score, the risk of stroke within $2$ days is stratified as follows:\n- Score $0-3$: Low risk\n- Score $4-5$: Moderate risk\n- Score $6-7$: High risk\n\nThe patient's score of $6$ places him in the high-risk category for a stroke in the subsequent $48$ hours, a finding that would typically warrant hospital admission for expedited evaluation and management.

We are updating our initial belief about a diagnosis (the pretest probability) based on new evidence (the result of a diagnostic test).\n\nLet us define the events:\n- $D$: The event that the patient has a left MCA TIA.\n- $D^c$: The event that the patient does not have a left MCA TIA (i.e., has a non-ischemic mimic).\n- $T^+$: The event that the diagnostic test is positive, which corresponds to the presence of isolated aphasia.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n- The pretest probability (or prior probability) of a TIA is $P(D) = p_0 = 0.32$.\n- The probability of not having a TIA is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68$.\n- The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present: $Se = P(T^+|D) = 0.46$.\n- The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent: $Sp = P(T^-|D^c) = 0.86$.\n\nWe are asked to find the post-test probability of a TIA given that the test was positive (isolated aphasia was present). This is the conditional probability $p_1 = P(D|T^+)$.\n\nBayes' theorem states:\n$$ P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, by summing the probability of a true positive and a false positive:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c) $$\n\nWe have $P(T^+|D)$ and $P(D)$. We need to find $P(T^+|D^c)$, which is the probability of a positive test in a patient without the disease (the false positive rate). This is the complement of the specificity:\n$$ P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - Sp $$\nSubstituting the given value for specificity:\n$$ P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - 0.86 = 0.14 $$\n\nNow we can calculate the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$:\n$$ P(T^+) = (0.46)(0.32) + (0.14)(0.68) $$\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.1472 + 0.0952 $$\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.2424 $$\n\nFinally, we can substitute all the components back into Bayes' theorem to find the post-test probability $p_1 = P(D|T^+)$:\n$$ p_1 = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{(0.46)(0.32)}{0.2424} $$\n$$ p_1 = \\frac{0.1472}{0.2424} $$\n$$ p_1 \\approx 0.607260726... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ p_1 \\approx 0.6073 $$\nThus, the updated probability (diagnostic confidence) of a left MCA TIA, given the presence of isolated aphasia, is approximately $0.6073$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6073}$$", "id": "4908401"}, {"introduction": "For patients who have experienced a TIA related to nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, the cornerstone of secondary prevention is oral anticoagulation.
