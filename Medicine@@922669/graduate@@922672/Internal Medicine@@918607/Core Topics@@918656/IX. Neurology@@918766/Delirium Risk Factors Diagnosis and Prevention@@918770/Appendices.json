Use the following foundational base: (i) the probability $p$ of an event can be represented by odds $p/(1-p)$, (ii) the natural logarithm of the odds (the log-odds) can be modeled as an additive combination of risk factor contributions, and (iii) the logistic function maps log-odds back to a probability in the interval $[0,1]$. Assume that risk factors contribute additively on the log-odds scale, reflecting multiplicative effects on the odds.\n\nConstruct a composite log-odds risk score for delirium with these four predictors: age, dementia, visual impairment, and polypharmacy. To improve clinical interpretability, center continuous predictors at clinically meaningful reference values. Specifically, let age be centered at $75$ years and scaled by decades, and let the number of regularly scheduled medications be centered at $5$. Let indicator variables $\\mathrm{Dementia}$ and $\\mathrm{VisualImp}$ take value $1$ if present and $0$ if absent.\n\nAssign the following hypothetical, directionally plausible coefficients for the log-odds model:\n- Intercept $\\beta_{0} = -1.2$ (baseline at age $75$, no dementia, no visual impairment, $5$ medications),\n- Age coefficient $\\beta_{\\text{age}} = 0.5$ per decade above the reference,\n- Dementia coefficient $\\beta_{\\text{dem}} = 1.0$,\n- Visual impairment coefficient $\\beta_{\\text{vis}} = 0.4$,\n- Polypharmacy coefficient $\\beta_{\\text{poly}} = 0.12$ per additional regularly scheduled medication above the reference.\n\nConsider an individual with age $83$ years, dementia present, no visual impairment, and who is taking $9$ regularly scheduled medications. Using only the core definitions described above (odds, log-odds additivity, and the logistic mapping), derive the individual’s predicted probability of developing delirium from the specified log-odds model and compute its numerical value.

The odds of an event with probability $p$ are $p/(1-p)$. The log-odds (also known as the logit) is $\\ln\\!\\big(p/(1-p)\\big)$.
