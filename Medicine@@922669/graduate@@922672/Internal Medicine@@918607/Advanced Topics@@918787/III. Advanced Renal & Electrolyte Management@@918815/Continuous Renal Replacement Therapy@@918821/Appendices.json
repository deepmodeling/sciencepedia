In this extracorporeal circuit, the driving force for ultrafiltration across the semipermeable membrane is the transmembrane pressure gradient.

A linear function of $x$ can be written as $p_b(x) = ax + b$. We can determine the constants $a$ and $b$ using the boundary conditions.\n\nAt the inlet ($x=0$):\n$$p_b(0) = a(0) + b = P_{in}$$\nThis gives $b = P_{in}$.\n\nAt the outlet ($x=L$):\n$$p_b(L) = aL + b = P_{out}$$\nSubstituting $b = P_{in}$, we get:\n$$aL + P_{in} = P_{out}$$\n$$a = \\frac{P_{out} - P_{in}}{L}$$\nThus, the blood pressure profile as a function of position $x$ is:\n$$p_b(x) = \\left(\\frac{P_{out} - P_{in}}{L}\\right)x + P_{in}$$\n\nThe local transmembrane pressure at any point $x$ is the difference between the blood-side pressure and the effluent-side pressure:\n$$\\mathrm{TMP}(x) = p_b(x) - p_e(x)$$\nSince $p_e(x)$ is uniform and equal to $P_{effluent}$, this becomes:\n$$\\mathrm{TMP}(x) = \\left[ \\left(\\frac{P_{out} - P_{in}}{L}\\right)x + P_{in} \\right] - P_{effluent}$$\n\nThe overall TMP is defined as the spatial average of this local pressure difference over the entire length of the filter, from $x=0$ to $x=L$.
