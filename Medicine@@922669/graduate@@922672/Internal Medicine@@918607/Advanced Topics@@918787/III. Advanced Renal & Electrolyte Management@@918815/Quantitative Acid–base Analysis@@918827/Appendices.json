It is based on the established physicochemical principles of the Stewart approach to acid-base balance, a core topic in quantitative physiology and internal medicine. The provided data are physiologically plausible, and the assumptions are clearly stated, rendering the problem self-contained and solvable.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part response: first, a mechanistic explanation for the change in the apparent Strong Ion Difference ($SID_a$), and second, a quantification of this change. The entire analysis will be based on the principle of electroneutrality and the definitions inherent in the Stewart framework.\n\n**Part 1: Mechanistic Explanation**\n\nThe fundamental principle governing ionic solutions, including blood plasma, is that of macroscopic electroneutrality. This principle requires that the sum of the molar concentrations of all cations (positive ions), weighted by their respective charges, must equal the sum of the molar concentrations of all anions (negative ions), also weighted by their charges. For plasma, where all significant ions have a charge of $\\pm 1$ or $\\pm 2$, and divalent ions are typically represented by their total molar concentration multiplied by their valence, we can write the charge balance equation as:\n$$ \\sum [\\text{Cations}^{+}] = \\sum [\\text{Anions}^{-}] $$\nThe Stewart approach categorizes these ions based on their behavior in aqueous solution at physiological pH. Strong ions are those that are fully dissociated at all times. Weak ions are those whose dissociation is dependent on the pH of the medium.\n\nThe charge balance equation can be expanded to show these categories:\n$$ \\sum [\\text{Strong Cations}] + [\\mathrm{H}^{+}] = \\sum [\\text{Strong Anions}] + [\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}] + [\\mathrm{A}^{-}] + [\\mathrm{OH}^{-}] $$\nHere, $\\sum [\\text{Strong Cations}]$ includes species like $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]$, $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]$, $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$, and $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]$. The term $\\sum [\\text{Strong Anions}]$ includes species like $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]$, $[\\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}]$, and pathological anions like $[\\mathrm{Lactate}^{-}]$. The term $[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]$ represents the total concentration of dissociated weak acids, primarily plasma proteins (like albumin) and phosphates.\n\nThe Strong Ion Difference ($SID$) is defined as the difference between the total concentration of all strong cations and all strong anions:\n$$ SID = \\sum [\\text{Strong Cations}] - \\sum [\\text{Strong Anions}] $$\nRearranging the charge balance equation and noting that the concentrations of $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$ and $[\\mathrm{OH}^{-}]$ are in the nanomolar range and thus arithmetically negligible compared to the other terms which are in the millimolar range, we find:\n$$ SID \\approx [\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}] + [\\mathrm{A}^{-}] $$\nThis relationship shows that the $SID$ represents the total electrical charge that must be balanced by the weak anions in the system. The body controls plasma pH by adjusting the concentrations of these weak anions, principally $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]$ (via respiration) and $[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]$ (which depends on total weak acid concentration and pH), to match the prevailing $SID$.\n\nThe problem refers to the *apparent* Strong Ion Difference, $SID_a$. This is the value calculated from the commonly measured strong ions. Let $\\sum[\\mathrm{SC}]$ be the sum of all strong cation concentrations and $\\sum[\\mathrm{SA}]$ be the sum of all strong anion concentrations.\n$$ SID_{a} = \\sum[\\mathrm{SC}] - \\sum[\\mathrm{SA}] $$\nThe problem states that plasma sodium remains unchanged, and other strong cations (potassium, calcium, magnesium) are also unchanged. Therefore, the total concentration of strong cations, $\\sum[\\mathrm{SC}]$, must be constant. The change in the total strong cation concentration is zero:\n$$ \\Delta \\left( \\sum[\\mathrm{SC}] \\right) = 0 $$\nConversely, the problem states that plasma chloride, $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]$, increases, while other strong anions are unchanged. The total concentration of strong anions is $\\sum[\\mathrm{SA}] = [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}] + [\\text{Other Strong Anions}]$. Since $[\\text{Other Strong Anions}]$ is constant, any change in the total strong anion concentration is due solely to the change in the chloride concentration:\n$$ \\Delta \\left( \\sum[\\mathrm{SA}] \\right) = \\Delta[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}] $$\nThe change in the apparent Strong Ion Difference, $\\Delta SID_a$, is by definition:\n$$ \\Delta SID_a = \\Delta \\left( \\sum[\\mathrm{SC}] - \\sum[\\mathrm{SA}] \\right) = \\Delta \\left( \\sum[\\mathrm{SC}] \\right) - \\Delta \\left( \\sum[\\mathrm{SA}] \\right) $$\nSubstituting the conditions from the problem:\n$$ \\Delta SID_a = 0 - \\Delta[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}] = -\\Delta[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}] $$\nThis equation provides the mechanistic explanation. The $SID_a$ is arithmetically defined as the difference between two quantities. If the first quantity (total strong cations) is constant, and a component of the second quantity (a strong anion, chloride) increases, leading to an increase in the total second quantity, then the difference between them must decrease by an exactly equal amount. Therefore, an increase in plasma chloride concentration, with all strong cations held constant, necessitates a decrease in the $SID_a$.\n\n**Part 2: Quantification of the Change**\n\nWe are asked to quantify the change in $SID_a$ given the specific change in chloride concentration.\nThe initial plasma chloride concentration is $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\text{initial}} = 104 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/L}$.\nThe final plasma chloride concentration is $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\text{final}} = 112 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/L}$.\n\nThe change in chloride concentration, $\\Delta[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]$, is:\n$$ \\Delta[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}] = [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\text{final}} - [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\text{initial}} $$\n$$ \\Delta[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}] = 112 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/L} - 104 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/L} = 8 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/L} $$\nUsing the relationship derived in the first part, $\\Delta SID_a = -\\Delta[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]$, we can calculate the change in the apparent Strong Ion Difference:\n$$ \\Delta SID_a = - (8 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/L}) = -8 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/L} $$\nThe change in the apparent Strong Ion Difference, $SID_a$, is $-8 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/L}$. This indicates a decrease of $8 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/L}$ from its initial value.

This can be simplified by treating the net charge from strong ions, which we can call the \"amount of SID\", as a conserved quantity. The total amount of SID in a given volume is the product of its concentration ($\\mathrm{SID}_a$) and the volume ($V$).\n\nFirst, let's determine the $\\mathrm{SID}_a$ of the infused fluid ($0.9\\%$ saline).\n$$ \\mathrm{SID}_{a,inf} = [\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{inf} - [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{inf} $$\nGiven $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{inf} = 154 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$ and $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{inf} = 154 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{SID}_{a,inf} = 154 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} - 154 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} = 0 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the initial total amount of SID in the patient's ECF.

Strong ions are those that are fully dissociated at physiological pH. Based on the problem statement, the strong ions to be considered are sodium ($Na^{+}$), potassium ($K^{+}$), chloride ($Cl^{-}$), and lactate ($Lactate^{-}$).\n\nThe formula for $SID_a$ is:\n$$SID_a = ([Na^{+}] + [K^{+}]) - ([Cl^{-}] + [Lactate^{-}])​$$\nThe given values are:\n$[Na^{+}] = 138~\\text{mmol/L}$\n$[K^{+}] = 4.2~\\text{mmol/L}$\n$[Cl^{-}] = 116~\\text{mmol/L}$\n$[Lactate^{-}] = 6.0~\\text{mmol/L}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$SID_a = (138 + 4.2)~\\text{mmol/L} - (116 + 6.0)~\\text{mmol/L}$$\n$$SID_a = 142.2~\\text{mmol/L} - 122.0~\\text{mmol/L}$$\n$$SID_a = 20.2~\\text{mmol/L}$$\nThis value is significantly lower than the normal physiological range (approximately $40-42~\\text{mmol/L}$), indicating a strong ion metabolic acidosis.\n\nStep 2: Calculation of the Effective Strong Ion Difference ($SID_e$)\nThe principle of electroneutrality dictates that the sum of all positive charges in plasma must equal the sum of all negative charges. The $SID_a$ represents the net charge from strong ions, which must be balanced by the net charge from the plasma buffer systems (weak acids) and the products of water dissociation. The effective strong ion difference, $SID_e$, quantifies the total charge contributed by the major plasma buffers: bicarbonate and non-volatile weak acids (primarily albumin and phosphate).\n\nThe formula for $SID_e$ is given by:\n$$SID_e = [HCO_3^{-}] + [A^{-}]_{Alb} + [A^{-}]_{Pi}$$\nwhere $[HCO_3^{-}]$ is the bicarbonate concentration, $[A^{-}]_{Alb}$ is the net negative charge on albumin, and $[A^{-}]_{Pi}$ is the net negative charge on inorganic phosphate. We will calculate each component.\n\nCalculation of Bicarbonate Concentration ($[HCO_3^{-}]$)\nThe bicarbonate concentration can be calculated from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates pH, the dissociation constant for carbonic acid, and the concentrations of bicarbonate and dissolved carbon dioxide.\nFirst, we calculate the concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide ($[CO_{2,d}]$) using Henry's Law:\n$$[CO_{2,d}] = s \\times P_{CO_2}$$\nGiven $s = 0.0307~\\text{mmol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\,\\text{mmHg}^{-1}$ and $P_{CO_2} = 28~\\text{mmHg}$:\n$$[CO_{2,d}] = 0.0307~\\text{mmol}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\,\\text{mmHg}^{-1} \\times 28~\\text{mmHg} = 0.8596~\\text{mmol/L}$$\nNext, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$\\text{pH} = pK_a + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[HCO_3^{-}]}{[CO_{2,d}]}\\right)$$\nWith the given values $\\text{pH} = 7.20$ and $pK_a = 6.10$:\n$$7.20 = 6.10 + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[HCO_3^{-}]}{0.8596~\\text{mmol/L}}\\right)$$\n$$1.10 = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[HCO_3^{-}]}{0.8596~\\text{mmol/L}}\\right)$$\nSolving for $[HCO_3^{-}]$:\n$$[HCO_3^{-}] = (0.8596~\\text{mmol/L}) \\times 10^{1.10}$$\n$$[HCO_3^{-}] \\approx 0.8596 \\times 12.58925~\\text{mmol/L} \\approx 10.8217~\\text{mmol/L}$$\n\nCalculation of Albumin Net Charge ($[A^{-}]_{Alb}$)\nThe problem provides an empirical formula for the net negative charge of albumin at physiological ionic strength:\n$$[A^{-}]_{Alb} \\approx [Alb] \\times (0.123 \\times \\text{pH} - 0.631)$$\nGiven $[Alb] = 28~\\text{g/L}$ and $\\text{pH} = 7.20$:\n$$[A^{-}]_{Alb} \\approx 28 \\times (0.123 \\times 7.20 - 0.631)$$\n$$[A^{-}]_{Alb} \\approx 28 \\times (0.8856 - 0.631) = 28 \\times 0.2546$$\n$$[A^{-}]_{Alb} \\approx 7.1288~\\text{mmol/L}$$\n\nCalculation of Phosphate Net Charge ($[A^{-}]_{Pi}$)\nSimilarly, an empirical formula is provided for the net negative charge of inorganic phosphate:\n$$[A^{-}]_{Pi} \\approx [Pi] \\times (0.309 \\times \\text{pH} - 0.469)$$\nGiven $[Pi] = 1.2~\\text{mmol/L}$ and $\\text{pH} = 7.20$:\n$$[A^{-}]_{Pi} \\approx 1.2 \\times (0.309 \\times 7.20 - 0.469)$$\n$$[A^{-}]_{Pi} \\approx 1.2 \\times (2.2248 - 0.469) = 1.2 \\times 1.7558$$\n$$[A^{-}]_{Pi} \\approx 2.10696~\\text{mmol/L}$$\n\nSumming the components for $SID_e$:\n$$SID_e = 10.8217~\\text{mmol/L} + 7.1288~\\text{mmol/L} + 2.10696~\\text{mmol/L}$$\n$$SID_e \\approx 20.0575~\\text{mmol/L}$$\n\nStep 3: Calculation of the Strong Ion Gap ($SIG$)\nThe strong ion gap ($SIG$) is defined as the difference between the apparent and effective strong ion differences.
