Proximal tubules reabsorb filtered solutes and low-molecular-weight (LMW) proteins.\n2.  Lysosomal storage leads to substrate accumulation with organ-specific phenotypes.\n3.  Weak acid solubility in urine is governed by acid-base equilibria.\n\n**Patient Summaries:**\n*   **Patient 1:** A $27$-year-old man with episodic burning pain in hands and feet since adolescence, heat intolerance, angiokeratomas over the lower trunk, cornea verticillata on slit-lamp examination, proteinuria of approximately $0.8$ $\\mathrm{g/day}$, and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiography.

The foundational facts are correct. The patient vignettes describe classic, albeit concise, presentations of well-recognized inherited nephropathies. The clinical and laboratory findings for each patient are internally consistent and representative of specific pathologies.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient, specific information for each patient to allow for a differential diagnosis and for a most likely diagnosis to be inferred through deductive reasoning. The question asks for the \"most consistent\" mapping, which implies a unique best fit among the choices.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated using clear, objective, and precise medical terminology (e.g., 'cornea verticillata', 'LMW proteinuria', 'non-anion gap metabolic acidosis'). There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, missing information, or ambiguity. The clinical scenarios are realistic.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will proceed by analyzing each patient's case based on the provided foundational principles and then evaluating the given options.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe task is to deduce the most likely diagnosis for each of the four patients by applying first principles of physiology and pathophysiology, and then to select the option that correctly maps all four diagnoses.\n\n**Analysis of Patient 1:**\n- **Data:** This $27$-year-old male presents with a multi-systemic disorder characterized by neuropathic pain (acroparesthesias), skin lesions (angiokeratomas), ophthalmologic findings (cornea verticillata), cardiac involvement (left ventricular hypertrophy), and renal disease (proteinuria, reduced eGFR).\n- **Mechanistic Reasoning:** This constellation of findings is pathognomonic for a systemic lysosomal storage disease. According to the provided principle, \"lysosomal storage leads to substrate accumulation with organ-specific phenotypes.\" The specific phenotype (neuropathy, angiokeratomas, cornea verticillata, cardiac hypertrophy, glomerulopathy) is classic for **Fabry disease**. This X-linked recessive disorder results from a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, leading to the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb$3$) in cells throughout the body, including the vascular endothelium, heart muscle cells, dorsal root ganglia neurons, and renal podocytes and tubular cells. This accumulation accounts for all the observed signs and symptoms.\n- **Conclusion for Patient 1:** Fabry disease.\n\n**Analysis of Patient 2:**\n- **Data:** This $24$-year-old male has recurrent nephrolithiasis, hypercalciuria, low-molecular-weight (LMW) proteinuria, and a family history suggestive of X-linked inheritance (two affected maternal uncles).\n- **Mechanistic Reasoning:** The key is the combination of LMW proteinuria and hypercalciuria. LMW proteinuria (evidenced by elevated urine beta-$2$ microglobulin) with minimal albuminuria points directly to a defect in the proximal tubule, as per the principle that \"proximal tubules reabsorb filtered...low-molecular-weight proteins.\" Failure of this reabsorptive function leads to the excretion of normally reabsorbed LMW proteins. The associated hypercalciuria explains the recurrent nephrolithiasis. The X-linked inheritance pattern strongly suggests a specific genetic cause. This triad of LMW proteinuria, hypercalciuria, and an X-linked pattern is the hallmark of **Dent disease**, a disorder of proximal tubular function caused by mutations in genes like *CLCN5* or *OCRL1* which are involved in endocytosis.\n- **Conclusion for Patient 2:** Dent disease.\n\n**Analysis of Patient 3:**\n- **Data:** This $23$-year-old female presents with a generalized proximal tubulopathy, known as Fanconi syndrome. The features include polyuria/polydipsia, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis (proximal renal tubular acidosis from bicarbonate wasting), hypophosphatemia (phosphate wasting), hypokalemia (potassium wasting), glycosuria with euglycemia (renal glycosuria), and generalized aminoaciduria. The critical diagnostic clue is the presence of corneal crystals.\n- **Mechanistic Reasoning:** The Fanconi syndrome is a direct consequence of the failure of the proximal tubule to perform its reabsorptive duties, consistent with the first foundational principle. The question is the underlying cause. The presence of corneal crystals in the context of Fanconi syndrome is pathognomonic for **nephropathic cystinosis**. This is a lysosomal storage disease where a mutation in the *CTNS* gene leads to a defective lysosomal cystine transporter (cystinosin). Following the second principle, this defect causes the accumulation and crystallization of cystine within lysosomes of cells throughout the body. The proximal tubular cells are particularly vulnerable to this crystal accumulation, leading to cell death (apoptosis) and the resulting Fanconi syndrome.\n- **Conclusion for Patient 3:** Nephropathic cystinosis.\n\n**Analysis of Patient 4:**\n- **Data:** This $31$-year-old male forms radiolucent kidney stones that are insoluble at an alkaline urine pH of $6.8$. Urinary uric acid is normal. The urine crystals are described as spherical, brown, with radial striations and strong birefringence. Treatment with allopurinol is effective.\n- **Mechanistic Reasoning:** The solubility of weak acids, such as uric acid, is highly dependent on pH, as stated in the third principle. Uric acid (pKa ~$5.4$-$5.8$) becomes much more soluble as the urine pH increases above its pKa. The fact that these stones persist at a pH of $6.8$ effectively rules out pure uric acid stones. The crystal morphology is highly characteristic of $2,8$-dihydroxyadenine ($2,8$-DHA). The formation of $2,8$-DHA stones is the pathognomonic feature of **adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency**. APRT is an enzyme in the purine salvage pathway. When deficient, its substrate, adenine, is shunted to an alternative pathway where it is oxidized by xanthine oxidase into the extremely insoluble $2,8$-DHA. This compound precipitates in the renal tubules, forming stones and causing crystalline nephropathy. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, blocks the conversion of adenine to $2,8$-DHA, explaining the therapeutic benefit.\n- **Conclusion for Patient 4:** Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency.\n\n**Summary of Diagnoses:**\n- Patient $1$: Fabry disease\n- Patient $2$: Dent disease\n- Patient $3$: Nephropathic cystinosis\n- Patient $4$: Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\nNow, we evaluate the provided options against our derived diagnoses.\n\n**A. Patient $1$ = Fabry disease; Patient $2$ = Dent disease; Patient $3$ = Nephropathic cystinosis; Patient $4$ = Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency**\n- **Evaluation:** This mapping perfectly matches the conclusions derived from the mechanistic analysis of each patient's case.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Patient $1$ = Fabry disease; Patient $2$ = Primary hyperoxaluria; Patient $3$ = Nephropathic cystinosis; Patient $4$ = Uric acid nephrolithiasis**\n- **Evaluation:**\n    - Patient $1$: Correct.\n    - Patient $2$: Incorrect. Primary hyperoxaluria causes calcium oxalate stones and nephrocalcinosis, but it is not characterized by LMW proteinuria or an X-linked inheritance pattern.\n    - Patient $3$: Correct.\n    - Patient $4$: Incorrect. The stones are insoluble at alkaline pH, which is inconsistent with uric acid stones. The crystal morphology is also not that of uric acid.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Patient $1$ = Alport syndrome; Patient $2$ = Dent disease; Patient $3$ = Wilson disease with Fanconi syndrome; Patient $4$ = Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency**\n- **Evaluation:**\n    - Patient $1$: Incorrect. Alport syndrome does not cause angiokeratomas, acroparesthesias, or cornea verticillata. Its classic extrarenal manifestations are sensorineural hearing loss and ocular defects like anterior lenticonus.\n    - Patient $2$: Correct.\n    - Patient $3$: Incorrect. While Wilson disease can cause Fanconi syndrome, the characteristic ocular finding is Kayser-Fleischer rings (copper deposition in Descemet's membrane), not corneal crystals from cystine.\n    - Patient $4$: Correct.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Patient $1$ = Fabry disease; Patient $2$ = Dent disease; Patient $3$ = Primary hyperoxaluria; Patient $4$ = Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency**\n- **Evaluation:**\n    - Patient $1$: Correct.\n    - Patient $2$: Correct.\n    - Patient $3$: Incorrect. Primary hyperoxaluria causes deposition of calcium oxalate crystals, not the full Fanconi syndrome with aminoaciduria, glycosuria, and phosphaturia seen in this patient. It also does not cause the type of corneal crystals described (which are cystine).\n    - Patient $4$: Correct.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nOnly option A provides the correct diagnosis for all four patients, based on a rigorous application of the provided principles to the clinical data.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4834209"}, {"introduction": "Once a specific genetic disorder like Fabry disease is suspected, confirming the diagnosis often requires sequencing the relevant gene.

The therapy, migalastat, increases the fraction of properly folded enzyme, which in turn increases $V_{\\max}$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Normal maximal velocity, $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{norm}} = 8.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- Fraction of active enzyme before therapy, $f_{0} = 0.060$\n- Fraction of active enzyme on therapy, $f_{1} = 0.30$\n- Michaelis constant, $K_{m} = 12\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- Gb3 production rate, $P = 0.30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the maximal velocities for the patient before ($V_{\\max,0}$) and during ($V_{\\max,1}$) therapy.\nBefore therapy:\n$$V_{\\max,0} = f_{0} V_{\\max,\\mathrm{norm}} = 0.060 \\times 8.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1} = 0.48\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\nDuring therapy:\n$$V_{\\max,1} = f_{1} V_{\\max,\\mathrm{norm}} = 0.30 \\times 8.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1} = 2.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\nIn both cases, $V_{\\max} > P$ ($0.48 > 0.30$ and $2.4 > 0.30$), so a stable, finite steady state is achievable.\n\nNow we can calculate the steady-state Gb3 concentration for each case using the derived formula for $S$.\nBefore therapy:\n$$S_{\\text{before}} = \\frac{P K_m}{V_{\\max,0} - P} = \\frac{(0.30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1})(12\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})}{0.48\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1} - 0.30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1}}$$\n$$S_{\\text{before}} = \\frac{3.6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^2\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1}}{0.18\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1}} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nDuring therapy:\n$$S_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{P K_m}{V_{\\max,1} - P} = \\frac{(0.30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1})(12\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})}{2.4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1} - 0.30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1}}$$\n$$S_{\\text{after}} = \\frac{3.6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}^2\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1}}{2.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{h}^{-1}} = \\frac{3.6}{2.1}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = \\frac{12}{7}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n\nThe absolute decrease in the lysosomal Gb3 concentration is the difference between these two values:\n$$\\Delta S = S_{\\text{before}} - S_{\\text{after}} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} - \\frac{12}{7}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n$$\\Delta S = \\left(\\frac{140}{7} - \\frac{12}{7}\\right)\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} = \\frac{128}{7}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division and round to four significant figures:\n$$\\Delta S \\approx 18.285714...\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $18.29\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{18.29}$$", "id": "4834216"}]}
