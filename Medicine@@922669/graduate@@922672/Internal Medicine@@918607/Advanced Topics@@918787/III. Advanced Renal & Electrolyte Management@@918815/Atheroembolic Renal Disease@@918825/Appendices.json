It is based on the fundamental principles of fluid dynamics (Hagen-Poiseuille law) applied to a standard, albeit simplified, model of renal physiology. The premises are consistent and provide sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the proportional reduction in glomerular filtration rate ($GFR$) resulting from a reduction in afferent arteriolar radius. The solution is derived from the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid through a cylindrical tube.\n\nThe Hagen-Poiseuille equation relates the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, to the pressure gradient, $\\Delta P$, the radius of the tube, $R$, the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, $\\eta$, and the length of the tube, $\\ell$. The equation is:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi R^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta \\ell}$$\nThe problem states that the pressure gradient $\\Delta P$, viscosity $\\eta$, and vessel length $\\ell$ are constant. Therefore, we can express the flow rate $Q$ as being proportional to the fourth power of the radius $R$:\n$$Q \\propto R^4$$\n\nLet the initial state be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final state after the obstruction by subscript $2$. The initial radius is $R_1$ and the initial flow is $Q_1$.\n$$Q_1 = C R_1^4$$\nwhere $C = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{8 \\eta \\ell}$ is a constant incorporating all the unchanging parameters.\n\nThe problem states that the effective afferent arteriolar radius is reduced by $20\\%$. This means the new radius, $R_2$, is $80\\%$ of the original radius, $R_1$.\n$$R_2 = R_1 \\times (1 - 0.20) = 0.80 R_1$$\n\nThe new volumetric flow, $Q_2$, is then:\n$$Q_2 = C R_2^4 = C (0.80 R_1)^4$$\n$$Q_2 = C (0.80)^4 R_1^4$$\n\nTo find the relationship between the final flow and the initial flow, we can take their ratio:\n$$\\frac{Q_2}{Q_1} = \\frac{C (0.80)^4 R_1^4}{C R_1^4} = (0.80)^4$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$(0.80)^4 = 0.4096$$\nThus, the final flow is $Q_2 = 0.4096 Q_1$.\n\nThe proportional reduction in inflow $Q$ is defined as the change in flow divided by the original flow:\n$$\\text{Proportional Reduction in } Q = \\frac{Q_1 - Q_2}{Q_1} = 1 - \\frac{Q_2}{Q_1}$$\nSubstituting the value of the ratio we found:\n$$\\text{Proportional Reduction in } Q = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904$$\n\nThe problem states that the glomerular filtration rate ($GFR$) is directly proportional to the inflow $Q$. This can be written as $GFR = kQ$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality (representing the filtration fraction, which is assumed constant for this instantaneous perturbation).\n\nLet $GFR_1$ be the initial glomerular filtration rate and $GFR_2$ be the final rate.\n$$GFR_1 = k Q_1$$\n$$GFR_2 = k Q_2$$\n\nThe proportional reduction in $GFR$ is:\n$$\\text{Proportional Reduction in } GFR = \\frac{GFR_1 - GFR_2}{GFR_1} = \\frac{k Q_1 - k Q_2}{k Q_1} = \\frac{k(Q_1 - Q_2)}{k Q_1} = \\frac{Q_1 - Q_2}{Q_1}$$\nThis demonstrates that the proportional reduction in $GFR$ is identical to the proportional reduction in the afferent arteriolar flow $Q$.\n$$\\text{Proportional Reduction in } GFR = 0.5904$$\nThe problem requests the answer as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.

This probability is denoted as $P(D \\mid L, E)$.

Applying this to our problem, we let $A = D$ and $B$ be the composite event of observing both $L$ and $E$, denoted as $(L \\cap E)$ or simply $(L, E)$.
