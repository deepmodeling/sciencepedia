A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to compute the positive predictive value (PPV), which is the conditional probability of having mucosal healing ($H$) given a positive test result ($T^{+}$). This is denoted as $P(H \\mid T^{+})$. The derivation will proceed from the fundamental definition of conditional probability.\n\nLet $H$ be the event that a patient has achieved mucosal healing.\nLet $H^c$ be the event that a patient has not achieved mucosal healing.\nLet $T^{+}$ be the event of a positive test result (fecal calprotectin $ 150 \\ \\mu\\text{g}/\\text{g}$).\nLet $T^{-}$ be the event of a negative test result (fecal calprotectin $\\geq 150 \\ \\mu\\text{g}/\\text{g}$).\n\nThe given information can be expressed in the language of probability:\n1.  Prevalence of mucosal healing: The prior probability of having the condition is $P(H) = 0.5$.\n2.  Sensitivity: The probability of a positive test given that the patient has mucosal healing is $P(T^{+} \\mid H) = 0.8$.\n3.  Specificity: The probability of a negative test given that the patient does not have mucosal healing is $P(T^{-} \\mid H^c) = 0.7$.\n\nFrom the definition of conditional probability, the PPV is given by:\n$$ P(H \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(H \\cap T^{+})}{P(T^{+})} $$\nwhere $P(H \\cap T^{+})$ is the joint probability of having mucosal healing and testing positive, and $P(T^{+})$ is the overall probability of testing positive.\n\nFirst, we express the numerator, $P(H \\cap T^{+})$, using the definition of conditional probability for sensitivity, $P(T^{+} \\mid H) = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\cap H)}{P(H)}$. Rearranging this expression yields:\n$$ P(H \\cap T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\cap H) = P(T^{+} \\mid H) P(H) $$\nThe values on the right-hand side are given.\n\nNext, we express the denominator, $P(T^{+})$, using the law of total probability. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: the patient has mucosal healing ($H$), or the patient does not have mucosal healing ($H^c$). Therefore, the total probability of a positive test is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:\n$$ P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\cap H) + P(T^{+} \\cap H^c) $$\nWe can rewrite each term using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$ P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\mid H) P(H) + P(T^{+} \\mid H^c) P(H^c) $$\nTo evaluate this expression, we need the values for $P(H^c)$ and $P(T^{+} \\mid H^c)$.\n\nThe event $H^c$ is the complement of $H$, so its probability is:\n$$ P(H^c) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 $$\n\nThe term $P(T^{+} \\mid H^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given the absence of mucosal healing. This is also known as the false positive rate. It can be derived from the specificity, $P(T^{-} \\mid H^c)$. Since for a given state (here, $H^c$), the test can only be positive ($T^{+}$) or negative ($T^{-}$), these are complementary events. Thus:\n$$ P(T^{+} \\mid H^c) + P(T^{-} \\mid H^c) = 1 $$\n$$ P(T^{+} \\mid H^c) = 1 - P(T^{-} \\mid H^c) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 $$\n\nNow, we can substitute all the known and derived values back into the expressions for the numerator and denominator of the PPV formula.\n\nNumerator:\n$$ P(H \\cap T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\mid H) P(H) = (0.8)(0.5) = 0.4 $$\n\nDenominator:\n$$ P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\mid H) P(H) + P(T^{+} \\mid H^c) P(H^c) $$\n$$ P(T^{+}) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.3)(0.5) $$\n$$ P(T^{+}) = 0.4 + 0.15 = 0.55 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the positive predictive value, $P(H \\mid T^{+})$:\n$$ P(H \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(H \\cap T^{+})}{P(T^{+})} = \\frac{0.4}{0.55} $$\n\nTo express this as a fraction in lowest terms, we can write:\n$$ \\frac{0.4}{0.55} = \\frac{40/100}{55/100} = \\frac{40}{55} $$\nThe greatest common divisor of $40$ and $55$ is $5$. Dividing the numerator and the denominator by $5$:\n$$ P(H \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{40 \\div 5}{55 \\div 5} = \\frac{8}{11} $$\n\nThus, the positive predictive value of the fecal calprotectin test for mucosal healing at week $14$ is $\\frac{8}{11}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{8}{11}}$$", "id": "4803465"}, {"introduction": "Once a biologic therapy is initiated, ensuring adequate drug exposure is crucial for achieving and maintaining remission.

Severe UC increases total infliximab clearance by adding a fecal loss pathway to catabolic clearance and by reducing FcRn salvage, thereby shortening half-life and lowering concentrations under the standard schedule; accelerated induction (days $0$, $7$, $21$) raises early exposure and the day $14$ concentration substantially, supporting its use under high inflammatory burden.\n\nB.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a clinically realistic scenario with all necessary pharmacokinetic parameters to perform a quantitative comparison between two dosing schedules. The underlying physiological mechanisms described for increased infliximab clearance in severe Ulcerative Colitis (UC)—namely, fecal loss through a compromised mucosal barrier and reduced FcRn-mediated salvage secondary to hypoalbuminemia—are well-established in the field of clinical pharmacology.\n\nThe problem requires a quantitative and mechanistic comparison of two infliximab induction schedules in a patient with severe UC characterized by high inflammatory burden and consequently high drug clearance.\n\nFirst, we establish the pharmacokinetic parameters for this patient based on the provided data.\n\n1.  **Total Clearance ($CL_{total}$)**: The total clearance is the sum of catabolic clearance ($CL_{catabolic}$) and fecal loss clearance ($CL_{fecal}$).\n    $$CL_{total} = CL_{catabolic} + CL_{fecal} = 0.30 \\ \\mathrm{L/day} + 0.30 \\ \\mathrm{L/day} = 0.60 \\ \\mathrm{L/day}$$\n    The data indicate that fecal loss constitutes $50\\%$ of the total drug clearance, a significant contribution reflecting the severe mucosal injury.\n\n2.  **Elimination Rate Constant ($k_{el}$)**: This constant relates total clearance to the volume of distribution ($Vd$).\n    $$k_{el} = \\frac{CL_{total}}{Vd} = \\frac{0.60 \\ \\mathrm{L/day}}{3.0 \\ \\mathrm{L}} = 0.20 \\ \\mathrm{day}^{-1}$$\n\n3.  **Half-Life ($t_{1/2}$)**: The half-life is determined by the elimination rate constant.\n    $$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{el}} = \\frac{0.693}{0.20 \\ \\mathrm{day}^{-1}} \\approx 3.47 \\ \\mathrm{days}$$\n    This is a markedly short half-life for a monoclonal antibody, which typically has a half-life of $2-3$ weeks. The high clearance in this severe disease state is the direct cause of this rapid elimination.\n\n4.  **Dose and Initial Concentration ($C_0$)**: The patient receives a dose ($D$) based on weight.\n    $$D = 5 \\ \\mathrm{mg/kg} \\times 70 \\ \\mathrm{kg} = 350 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n    Assuming instantaneous distribution into the central volume, the initial concentration after the first intravenous infusion is:\n    $$C_0 = \\frac{D}{Vd} = \\frac{350 \\ \\mathrm{mg}}{3.0 \\ \\mathrm{L}} \\approx 116.7 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$$\n\nNow, we analyze the concentration-time profiles for both schedules to determine the concentration at day $14$. The concentration $C(t)$ at a time $t$ after a single IV bolus is given by $C(t) = C_0 e^{-k_{el} t}$.\n\n**Standard Schedule (infusions at days $0$, $14$, $42$)**\nThe concentration at day $14$ under this schedule corresponds to the trough concentration just before the second dose. It depends only on the first dose given at day $0$.\n$$C_{standard}(14) = C_0 \\times e^{-k_{el} \\times 14 \\ \\mathrm{days}}$$\n$$C_{standard}(14) \\approx 116.7 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L} \\times e^{-0.20 \\times 14} = 116.7 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L} \\times e^{-2.8}$$\n$$C_{standard}(14) \\approx 116.7 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L} \\times 0.0608 \\approx 7.1 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$$\nThis trough concentration is low, potentially sub-therapeutic, and reflects the rapid drug elimination.\n\n**Accelerated Schedule (infusions at days $0$, $7$, $21$)**\nThe concentration at day $14$ is calculated using the principle of superposition. It is the sum of the concentration remaining from the dose at day $0$ and the concentration remaining from the dose at day $7$.\n$$C_{accelerated}(14) = (\\text{conc. from dose at day } 0) + (\\text{conc. from dose at day } 7)$$\n$$C_{accelerated}(14) = [C_0 \\times e^{-k_{el} \\times (14-0)}] + [C_0 \\times e^{-k_{el} \\times (14-7)}]$$\n$$C_{accelerated}(14) = [C_0 \\times e^{-k_{el} \\times 14}] + [C_0 \\times e^{-k_{el} \\times 7}]$$\n$$C_{accelerated}(14) \\approx [116.7 \\times e^{-2.8}] + [116.7 \\times e^{-1.4}]$$\n$$C_{accelerated}(14) \\approx [7.1 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L}] + [116.7 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L} \\times 0.2466]$$\n$$C_{accelerated}(14) \\approx 7.1 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L} + 28.8 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L} \\approx 35.9 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$$\nThe accelerated schedule results in a day $14$ concentration of approximately $35.9 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$, which is about $5$ times higher than the day $14$ trough concentration under the standard schedule. This demonstrates a substantial increase in early drug exposure, which is the intended goal to overcome the high clearance.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Severe UC increases total infliximab clearance by adding a fecal loss pathway to catabolic clearance and by reducing FcRn salvage, thereby shortening half-life and lowering concentrations under the standard schedule; accelerated induction (days $0$, $7$, $21$) raises early exposure and the day $14$ concentration substantially, supporting its use under high inflammatory burden.**\nThis statement is entirely consistent with our analysis.\n-   It correctly identifies the mechanisms of increased clearance (fecal loss, reduced FcRn salvage).\n-   It correctly states the consequence is a shortened half-life (calculated as $\\approx 3.5$ days).\n-   It correctly states that this leads to lower concentrations under the standard schedule (calculated trough of $\\approx 7.1 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$).\n-   It correctly states that the accelerated schedule raises early exposure and the day $14$ concentration substantially (calculated as $\\approx 35.9 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$).\n-   The conclusion that this supports its use in high inflammatory burden is the correct clinical interpretation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Severe UC decreases infliximab clearance because mucosal barrier disruption enhances FcRn recycling, prolonging half-life; therefore, the standard schedule suffices and accelerated induction is unnecessary.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. Severe UC _increases_ infliximab clearance, it does not decrease it. The mechanism proposed, that barrier disruption enhances FcRn recycling, is scientifically unsound; hypoalbuminemia and inflammation tend to reduce FcRn recycling capacity. Consequently, the half-life is shortened, not prolonged, and the standard schedule is often insufficient.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Early fecal loss is clinically irrelevant because monoclonal antibodies are not eliminated via the intestine; the main driver of clearance is renal excretion. Any adjustment should be a single $50\\%$ dose increase at day $42$, not an accelerated induction.**\nThis statement contains several fundamental errors. First, the problem data explicitly show fecal loss is highly relevant, accounting for half the total clearance. A protein-losing enteropathy in severe UC is a known exception to the rule that mAbs are not intestinally eliminated. Second, the main driver of clearance for large molecules like monoclonal antibodies is cellular catabolism, not renal excretion, as they are too large for glomerular filtration. Finally, an adjustment at day $42$ would be far too late to manage severe, active disease that requires rapid control.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Accelerated induction should be avoided in severe UC because higher early infliximab exposure saturates target-mediated drug disposition and risks accumulation; fecal loss does not change total clearance meaningfully in this setting.**\nThis statement is flawed. The claim that fecal loss is not meaningful contradicts the provided data ($CL_{fecal}$ is $50\\%$ of $CL_{total}$). While higher exposure does saturate the target (TNF-alpha), this is a therapeutic goal, not a reason to avoid it. The primary concern here is not accumulation but rather sub-therapeutic levels due to rapid clearance. With a very short half-life of $\\approx 3.5$ days, the risk of significant accumulation is low; the accelerated dosing is designed specifically to compensate for the rapid elimination.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4803426"}]}
