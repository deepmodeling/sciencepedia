All necessary data and assumptions are provided. The problem is a relevant application of principles from internal medicine (gastroenterology) and biostatistics.\n\nThe patient is a $55$-year-old individual with biopsy-proven celiac disease who, despite $12$ months on a strict gluten-free diet and normalization of serologies, has persistent symptoms and villous atrophy (Marsh $3\\mathrm{b}$). This clinical presentation meets the definition of refractory celiac disease (RCD). The diagnostic distinction between RCD1 and RCD2 is based on the immunophenotype of the intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) population. RCD2 is characterized by the presence of an aberrant IEL population, typically defined as composing $>20\\%$ of the total IELs.

These findings definitively classify the patient as having RCD2.\n\nA stepwise diagnostic and management approach for this patient is as follows:\n$1$. **Confirmation of Diagnosis and Exclusion of Ongoing Gluten Exposure:** The first step is to rigorously verify adherence to the gluten-free diet. This should be performed by an expert dietitian. Objective testing using assays for gluten immunogenic peptides in stool or urine should be performed to definitively rule out inadvertent gluten intake.\n\n$2$. **Exclusion of Alternative Causes for Villous Atrophy:** While the immunophenotype is highly specific for RCD2, other causes of non-responsive celiac disease and villous atrophy should be formally considered and excluded. This includes screening for common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) by measuring serum immunoglobulin levels, autoimmune enteropathy, and medication-induced enteropathies (e.g., from olmesartan).\n\n$3$. **Staging for Complications (Enteropathy-Associated T-cell Lymphoma - EATL):** RCD2 is a premalignant condition with a high risk of transformation to EATL. Comprehensive staging is mandatory.\n    - Initial cross-sectional imaging was negative. Advanced imaging with ${}^{18}\\mathrm{F}$-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) is the next indicated step to identify occult, metabolically active lymphomatous lesions.\n    - Video capsule endoscopy should be performed to inspect the entire small bowel mucosa for ulcers, strictures, or masses that may not be visible on cross-sectional imaging.\n    - Any suspicious lesions identified on imaging or capsule endoscopy must be targeted for biopsy, which may require device-assisted enteroscopy (e.g., double-balloon enteroscopy).\n    - A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are often recommended to complete staging and rule out systemic dissemination.\n\n$4$. **Initial Management Plan for RCD2:** The therapeutic goal is to eradicate the aberrant T-cell clone to induce mucosal healing and prevent progression to EATL.\n    - **Nutritional Support:** Aggressive management of malnutrition is critical, often requiring enteral or parenteral nutrition.\n    - **Pharmacotherapy:** There is no single standard-of-care therapy, but management is guided by the high malignant potential. Budesonide may provide symptomatic relief but does not alter the natural history. Cladribine, a chemotherapeutic agent, has demonstrated efficacy in inducing clonal remission and mucosal healing.

Finally, the ratio of non-protein calories to grams of nitrogen is computed. The solution also addresses the qualitative part of the question concerning micronutrient supplementation.\n\nTo perform the calculations, two standard conversion factors are required:\n$1$. The energy content of protein is approximately $4$ kcal per gram.\n$2$. The nitrogen content of protein is approximately $16\\%$. This is commonly expressed as $1$ gram of nitrogen for every $6.25$ grams of protein.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Total Daily Energy Requirement**\nThe total energy requirement is given as $30$ kcal/kg/day for a $60$ kg patient.\n$$\n\\text{Total Energy} = 30 \\, \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} \\times 60 \\, \\text{kg} = 1800 \\, \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Total Daily Protein Requirement**\nThe protein requirement is given as $1.5$ g/kg/day for a $60$ kg patient.\n$$\n\\text{Total Protein} = 1.5 \\, \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} \\times 60 \\, \\text{kg} = 90 \\, \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Protein-Derived Energy**\nUsing the standard conversion of $4$ kcal per gram of protein, the energy supplied by the protein component is calculated.\n$$\n\\text{Protein Calories} = 90 \\, \\text{g} \\times 4 \\, \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{g}} = 360 \\, \\text{kcal}\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Non-Protein Calories (NPC)**\nThe non-protein calories are the total calories minus the calories derived from protein.

Refractory celiac disease with severe malabsorption represents a state of intestinal failure, primarily affecting the proximal small bowel (duodenum and jejunum), which is the principal site for absorbing iron, folate, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Parenteral repletion is mandatory.\n\n*   **Key Inclusions in TPN Formulation:**\n    *   **Fat-Soluble Vitamins (A, D, E, K):** Severe steatorrhea precludes their absorption. Deficiency of vitamin K impairs coagulation (monitored by Prothrombin Time/INR), and vitamin D deficiency exacerbates calcium malabsorption, leading to metabolic bone disease.\n    *   **Thiamine (Vitamin B1):** This is of critical importance. Administering a high-carbohydrate TPN load to a thiamine-deficient patient can precipitate acute Wernicke's encephalopathy, a neurological emergency. Thiamine must be repleted prior to or along with the initiation of TPN.\n    *   **Other B Vitamins:** Folate (B9) is absorbed proximally and will be deficient. Cobalamin (B12) may also be deficient if the disease process extends to the terminal ileum. Standard multivitamin preparations for infusion are essential.\n    *   **Trace Elements:** Zinc, selenium, and copper are critical. Zinc deficiency impairs mucosal healing and immune function. Selenium is a key component of antioxidant enzymes.\n    *   **Macrominerals/Electrolytes:** Aggressive repletion and monitoring of phosphate, potassium, and magnesium are paramount to prevent refeeding syndrome, a potentially fatal condition caused by rapid intracellular shifts of these electrolytes upon re-introducing nutrition. Severe diarrhea in celiac disease leads to large losses of magnesium. Hypomagnesemia can cause refractory hypokalemia and hypocalcemia.\n\n*   **Monitoring Priorities:**\n    *   **Initial (first week):** Monitor serum phosphate, magnesium, and potassium at least daily to manage refeeding syndrome. Monitor blood glucose closely.\n    *   **Routine:** Monitor liver function tests (TPN can cause cholestasis), triglycerides (to ensure lipid emulsion clearance), and PT/INR (for vitamin K status).\n    *   **Long-term:** Periodically measure levels of specific micronutrients, such as 25-hydroxyvitamin D, zinc, copper, and selenium, to guide ongoing supplementation. Complete blood count and iron studies are needed to manage anemia.\n\nThe final answer required is the numerical value of the NPC:N ratio.\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = 100\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, this is $1.00 \\times 10^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.00 \\times 10^{2}}$$", "id": "4892175"}]}
