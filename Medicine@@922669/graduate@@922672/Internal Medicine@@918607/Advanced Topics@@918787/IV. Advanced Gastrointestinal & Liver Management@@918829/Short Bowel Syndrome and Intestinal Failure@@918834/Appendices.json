Fasting fibroblast growth factor $19$ (FGF$19$) is low.\n\n**Patient 2:**\n- Age: $49$-year-old female\n- Condition: Mesenteric ischemia\n- Surgery: Extensive small bowel resection, removing approximately $130$ cm of terminal ileum; colon remains in continuity.\n- Symptoms: Bulky, greasy stools, weight loss, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. Diarrhea partially improves with an overnight fast.\n- Stool Electrolytes: $\\text{Na}^+ = 40$ mmol/L, $\\text{K}^+ = 15$ mmol/L.\n- Fecal Fat: $24$ g/day ($72$-hour collection).\n- Therapeutic Trial: Oral bile acid sequestrant increases stool fat and worsens stool frequency.\n- Laboratory Data: Serum C4 is elevated. Fasting FGF$19$ is very low.\n\n**Definitions:**\n- Stool osmotic gap estimate: $290 - 2 \\times ([\\text{Na}^+] + [\\text{K}^+])$ mOsm/kg.\n- Normal $72$-hour fecal fat excretion: less than $7$ g/day on a $100$ g/day fat diet.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on the well-established pathophysiology of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and the consequences of its disruption by ileal resection. The clinical vignettes, laboratory values (C4, FGF19), stool studies, and responses to therapy are all consistent with recognized medical science in the field of gastroenterology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient, distinct data for two patients and asks for the physiological mechanism and therapeutic response, which can be deduced from the givens. A unique solution is expected.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using objective clinical and laboratory data.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The data are internally consistent and sufficient for analysis. For example, the resection lengths ($35$ cm vs. $130$ cm) correctly correlate with the different clinical pictures and laboratory findings.\n- **Realism:** The scenarios are classic and realistic presentations of short bowel syndrome.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. We can proceed to a full analysis.\n\n### Physiological Derivation\n\nThe core physiological process is the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Bile acids are synthesized by the liver, secreted into the duodenum to form micelles for fat absorption, and then predominantly reabsorbed ( $95\\%$) in the terminal ileum. Resection of the terminal ileum disrupts this process, with consequences dependent on the length of resection.\n\n1.  **Limited Ileal Resection (typically  100 cm):**\n    - The active reabsorption of bile acids is impaired.\n    - The liver's synthetic capacity can compensate for the loss, maintaining a sufficient bile acid pool in the jejunum for adequate micelle formation and fat digestion. Thus, significant steatorrhea does not occur.\n    - However, the unreabsorbed bile acids \"spill\" into the colon, where they induce a secretory diarrhea by stimulating chloride and water secretion (choleretic or bile acid diarrhea).\n    - This diarrhea is secretory in nature, characterized by a low stool osmotic gap and persistence with fasting.\n    - A bile acid sequestrant (e.g., cholestyramine) binds the excess bile acids in the lumen, preventing their colonic secretagogue effect and thus reducing diarrhea.\n    - In this state, poor bile acid reabsorption in the ileum leads to low FGF19 production. Low FGF19 removes the negative feedback on the liver enzyme cholesterol $7\\alpha$-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), leading to increased bile acid synthesis. Serum C4, a marker of CYP7A1 activity, will be elevated.\n\n2.  **Extensive Ileal Resection (typically  100 cm):**\n    - The loss of bile acids is so large that the liver's compensatory synthesis is overwhelmed.\n    - The total bile acid pool becomes depleted. The concentration of bile acids in the proximal small intestine drops below the critical micellar concentration (CMC).\n    - The result is severe malabsorption of fat (steatorrhea) and fat-soluble vitamins.\n    - The unabsorbed fatty acids enter the colon, where they are hydroxylated by bacteria, creating potent secretagogues that contribute to the diarrhea (fatty acid diarrhea). This diarrhea has both an osmotic component (from malabsorbed nutrients) and a secretory component.\n    - Giving a bile acid sequestrant in this situation is detrimental. It binds the already scarce intraluminal bile acids, further impairing micelle formation and worsening steatorrhea.\n    - As with limited resection, FGF19 will be very low, and C4 will be elevated as the liver attempts maximal, albeit insufficient, compensation.\n\n### Analysis of Patient Cases\n\n**Patient 1:**\n- **Resection:** $35$ cm, which is a **limited resection**.\n- **Fecal Fat:** $6$ g/day, which is not significant steatorrhea. This aligns with the liver maintaining an adequate bile acid pool.\n- **Diarrhea Characteristics:** Watery and persists with fasting, which strongly suggests a **secretory process**.\n- **Stool Osmotic Gap:** $290 - 2 \\times (100 + 40) = 290 - 280 = 10$ mOsm/kg. A value $ 50$ mOsm/kg is the defining characteristic of a secretory diarrhea.\n- **Labs:** Low FGF19 and high C4 ($60$ ng/mL) confirm impaired ileal bile acid absorption and compensatory hepatic synthesis.\n- **Therapeutic Response:** Marked improvement with a bile acid sequestrant confirms that excess colonic bile acids were the primary cause of diarrhea.\n- **Conclusion:** This is a classic case of **bile acid-mediated secretory diarrhea** due to limited ileal resection.\n\n**Patient 2:**\n- **Resection:** $130$ cm, which is an **extensive resection**.\n- **Fecal Fat:** $24$ g/day, indicating **severe steatorrhea**. This aligns with depletion of the bile acid pool and failed micelle formation.\n- **Diarrhea Characteristics:** Bulky, greasy stools, partially improving with fasting (less fat intake), consistent with malabsorption.\n- **Stool Osmotic Gap:** $290 - 2 \\times (40 + 15) = 290 - 110 = 180$ mOsm/kg. A value $ 100$ mOsm/kg indicates an osmotic diarrhea, caused by unabsorbed solutes (in this case, fatty acids).\n- **Labs:** Very low FGF19 and elevated C4 are consistent with severe bile acid malabsorption and maximal hepatic synthesis attempts.\n- **Therapeutic Response:** Worsening of symptoms with a bile acid sequestrant is the hallmark of this condition, as the sequestrant further reduces the already insufficient bile acids available for fat digestion.\n- **Conclusion:** This is a classic case of **steatorrhea and fatty acid diarrhea** due to bile acid pool depletion from extensive ileal resection.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Patient 1: colonic bile acid–mediated secretory diarrhea due to limited ileal malabsorption; bile acid sequestrant improves symptoms. Patient 2: steatorrhea from impaired micelle formation due to severe bile acid depletion; bile acid sequestrant worsens fat absorption.**\n- This option correctly identifies the pathophysiology and therapeutic response for both patients based on our derivation. Patient 1 has limited resection causing secretory diarrhea responsive to sequestrants. Patient 2 has extensive resection causing steatorrhea, which is worsened by sequestrants.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Patient 1: steatorrhea from impaired micelle formation due to severe bile acid depletion; bile acid sequestrant worsens fat absorption. Patient 2: colonic bile acid–mediated secretory diarrhea due to limited ileal malabsorption; bile acid sequestrant improves symptoms.**\n- This option reverses the correct diagnoses and therapeutic responses for the two patients. Patient 1 does not have steatorrhea, and Patient 2 does not have a limited resection.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Both patients have colonic bile acid–mediated secretory diarrhea; bile acid sequestrant improves symptoms in both.**\n- This is incorrect. Patient 2 has severe steatorrhea ($24$ g/day fecal fat), not just secretory diarrhea, and her symptoms worsen with sequestrants.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Both patients have steatorrhea from impaired micelle formation due to severe bile acid depletion; bile acid sequestrant improves symptoms in both by reducing luminal bile acids.**\n- This is incorrect. Patient 1 does not have significant steatorrhea. It also incorrectly states that a sequestrant improves symptoms for Patient 2, which contradicts the provided data.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Patient 1: osmotic diarrhea from carbohydrate malabsorption; bile acid sequestrant has no rational role. Patient 2: colonic bile acid–mediated secretory diarrhea; bile acid sequestrant improves symptoms.**\n- This is incorrect. Patient 1's diarrhea is secretory (stool osmotic gap of $10$ mOsm/kg), not osmotic, and the sequestrant was highly effective. This option also mischaracterizes Patient 2, whose primary problem is steatorrhea and who worsens with sequestrants.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4898822"}, {"introduction": "Once a patient is diagnosed with intestinal failure, designing an appropriate nutritional plan is paramount.
