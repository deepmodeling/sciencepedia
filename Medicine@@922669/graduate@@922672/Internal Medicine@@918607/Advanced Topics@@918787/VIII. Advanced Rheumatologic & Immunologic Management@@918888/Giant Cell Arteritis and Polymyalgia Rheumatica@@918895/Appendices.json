The quantities provided are within a realistic range for medical diagnostics. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nLet us define the relevant events:\n- $\\text{GCA}$: The patient has giant cell arteritis.\n- $\\neg \\text{GCA}$: The patient does not have giant cell arteritis.\n- $\\text{US}^+$: The temporal artery ultrasound result is positive.\n- $\\text{US}^-$: The temporal artery ultrasound result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1.  The pretest probability of GCA, which is the prior probability: $P(\\text{GCA}) = 0.30$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the ultrasound, which is the probability of a positive test given the disease is present: $P(\\text{US}^+ \\mid \\text{GCA}) = 0.80$.\n3.  The specificity of the ultrasound, which is the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent: $P(\\text{US}^- \\mid \\neg \\text{GCA}) = 0.90$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the post-test probability of GCA given a positive ultrasound result, denoted as $P(\\text{GCA} \\mid \\text{US}^+)$.\n\nWe will derive this using the fundamental definition of conditional probability:\n$$ P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} $$\nApplying this to our specific problem, we have:\n$$ P(\\text{GCA} \\mid \\text{US}^+) = \\frac{P(\\text{GCA} \\cap \\text{US}^+)}{P(\\text{US}^+)} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, $P(\\text{GCA} \\cap \\text{US}^+)$, which is the joint probability of having GCA and receiving a positive ultrasound result. We can use the definition of conditional probability for sensitivity:\n$$ P(\\text{US}^+ \\mid \\text{GCA}) = \\frac{P(\\text{GCA} \\cap \\text{US}^+)}{P(\\text{GCA})} $$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the numerator gives:\n$$ P(\\text{GCA} \\cap \\text{US}^+) = P(\\text{US}^+ \\mid \\text{GCA}) \\times P(\\text{GCA}) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ P(\\text{GCA} \\cap \\text{US}^+) = 0.80 \\times 0.30 = 0.24 $$\nThis value represents the probability of a true positive result in the general patient population being considered.\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, $P(\\text{US}^+)$, which is the total probability of receiving a positive ultrasound result. A positive result can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios:\n1.  The patient has GCA and tests positive (a true positive).\n2.  The patient does not have GCA and tests positive (a false positive).\n\nUsing the law of total probability, we can express $P(\\text{US}^+)$ as the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:\n$$ P(\\text{US}^+) = P(\\text{GCA} \\cap \\text{US}^+) + P(\\neg \\text{GCA} \\cap \\text{US}^+) $$\n\nWe have already calculated the first term, $P(\\text{GCA} \\cap \\text{US}^+) = 0.24$.\nTo find the second term, $P(\\neg \\text{GCA} \\cap \\text{US}^+)$, we first need the probabilities $P(\\neg \\text{GCA})$ and $P(\\text{US}^+ \\mid \\neg \\text{GCA})$.\n\nThe probability of not having GCA is the complement of having GCA:\n$$ P(\\neg \\text{GCA}) = 1 - P(\\text{GCA}) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70 $$\n\nThe probability $P(\\text{US}^+ \\mid \\neg \\text{GCA})$ is the false positive rate. This can be derived from the specificity, $P(\\text{US}^- \\mid \\neg \\text{GCA})$.

The pathophysiology of GCA, the risks of its complications (aortic aneurysm), the characteristics of various imaging modalities (CTA, MRA, PET/CT, US), and the pharmacological effects of treatments (glucocorticoids, tocilizumab) are all accurately represented and consistent with current medical science.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a specific clinical case with sufficient data and a clear set of guiding principles to arrive at a logical conclusion. The objective—to find the best balance between monitoring efficacy and risk minimization—is clearly stated, allowing for a determinable solution among the choices.\n*   **Objective:** The language is objective and clinical.

The patient data is consistent, and the required task is a standard clinical reasoning exercise.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe objective is to devise a $5$-year imaging strategy for a patient with LV-GCA that effectively monitors for both active inflammation and long-term structural complications (aortic aneurysms) while adhering to the principle of minimizing iatrogenic risk (radiation and contrast exposure).\n\n1.  **Baseline Staging:** The first step is to establish a comprehensive baseline of the entire aorta and its major branches. This is critical for detecting future changes, particularly in aortic diameter.\n    *   The choice of modality is between CTA, MRA, and FDG-PET/CT.\n    *   According to the provided principles, MRA \"avoids ionizing radiation\" and \"can evaluate the entire aorta.\" This is a major advantage for a long-term monitoring strategy where cumulative radiation is a concern.\n    *   CTA provides \"excellent spatial resolution\" but at the cost of \"ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast.\" While this patient has no contraindication to contrast, avoiding radiation is a key goal.\n    *   FDG-PET/CT involves \"substantial ionizing radiation\" and is \"not generally required for routine serial monitoring.\" While useful for assessing initial inflammatory activity, it is less ideal as a primary tool for longitudinal structural monitoring and carries a high radiation burden.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A baseline contrast-enhanced MRA is the optimal choice. It provides the necessary anatomical detail of the entire aorta to serve as a reference for future structural changes without exposing the patient to ionizing radiation at the outset of a long surveillance period.\n\n2.  **Early Follow-up (Monitoring Treatment Response):** The patient has known active inflammation in the axillary arteries.\n    *   The principles state that ultrasonography \"can track the 'halo sign' as a marker of arterial wall edema in active inflammation\" and is ideal for \"superficial accessible arteries.\"\n    *   Using targeted vascular US of the axillary arteries at $1$–$3$ months post-treatment initiation offers a low-risk, non-invasive method to confirm response to therapy. This avoids a full-body scan simply to check a known, accessible site of disease.\n\n3.  **Long-Term Surveillance (Monitoring for Structural Complications):** This is the core of the long-term strategy.\n    *   The primary risk is \"new aortic dilatation and aneurysm formation that can manifest years after apparent disease control.\" Monitoring for this requires periodic imaging of the entire aorta.\n    *   The unreliability of ESR/CRP on tocilizumab makes imaging surveillance mandatory.\n    *   For serial imaging, the cumulative risk of radiation from repeated CTAs becomes a significant concern. MRA remains the preferred modality as it avoids this risk.\n    *   The frequency must balance the need for detection against the burden of testing. Aneurysms are typically slow-growing. An initial follow-up scan at $1$ year, followed by scans every $2$ years (e.g., at year $3$ and year $5$) is a rational approach that balances surveillance with risk/cost/inconvenience, with the option for interim imaging if new clinical signs or symptoms emerge.\n\n4.  **Role of Contingent Imaging:**\n    *   FDG-PET/CT and CTA should be reserved for specific clinical scenarios, such as diagnostic uncertainty or when MRA is contraindicated or non-diagnostic, as stated in the principles. Routine use is not justified.\n\n**Summary of Optimal Strategy:**\n*   **Baseline:** Contrast-enhanced MRA of the entire aorta.\n*   **Short-Term:** Targeted vascular US at $1$–$3$ months to assess treatment response.\n*   **Long-Term:** Serial whole-aorta MRA at intervals of approximately $1$–$2$ years.\n*   **Contingency:** Reserve PET/CT and CTA for specific problem-solving.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Baseline CTA of the entire aorta and great vessels, followed by CTA every $6$ months for $5$ years; add FDG-PET/CT annually to track vascular inflammation.**\n    This strategy proposes an exceptionally high burden of ionizing radiation ($10$ CTAs and $5$ PET/CTs over $5$ years). This directly contradicts the principle of minimizing radiation risk. The frequency of imaging ($6$ months) is excessive for monitoring slow structural changes, and annual PET/CT for routine surveillance is explicitly discouraged by the provided principles.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B. Baseline contrast-enhanced MRA of the entire aorta and great vessels to document extent and diameters; targeted vascular ultrasound of temporal and axillary arteries at approximately $1$–$3$ months after treatment initiation and again at $6$–$12$ months if clinically indicated; whole-aorta MRA at $12$ months and then every $2$ years through year $5$ (for example at years $1$, $3$, and $5$ if clinically warranted), with interim imaging only for new symptoms or exam abnormalities; reserve FDG-PET/CT for unresolved diagnostic uncertainty or discordant clinical–laboratory findings; avoid CTA unless MRA is contraindicated or nondiagnostic.**\n    This strategy aligns perfectly with the derived optimal approach. It uses MRA to avoid radiation for baseline and long-term aortic surveillance. It employs targeted ultrasound for low-risk monitoring of known accessible disease. The imaging frequency is rational. It correctly reserves high-radiation modalities like PET/CT and CTA for specific indications. This plan provides comprehensive monitoring while minimizing iatrogenic risks.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **C. Baseline FDG-PET/CT to stage disease, then no further imaging after treatment starts; rely on clinical assessment plus ESR and CRP every $3$ months to detect relapse, adding PET only if symptoms recur.**\n    This approach is critically flawed. It completely fails to conduct surveillance for the known long-term risk of aortic aneurysm, which can be asymptomatic. Furthermore, it proposes relying on ESR/CRP, which the problem statement explicitly identifies as unreliable for monitoring patients on interleukin-$6$ blockade.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Transthoracic echocardiography every $6$ months and carotid duplex annually, without cross-sectional aortic imaging, because these modalities avoid radiation and contrast; add CTA only if blood pressure increases or a new murmur is detected.**\n    This strategy is inadequate because it fails to visualize the aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta, all of which are at significant risk in LV-GCA. Relying on TTE and carotid duplex alone provides an incomplete and therefore unsafe assessment of the patient's primary structural risk.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Baseline MRA without contrast of the thoracic aorta only, then annual FDG-PET/CT for $5$ years to survey the whole aorta and branches for active inflammation; no ultrasound follow-up is needed once therapy begins.**\n    This option has multiple deficiencies. The baseline imaging is incomplete (\"thoracic aorta only\"), failing to assess the abdominal aorta. The surveillance plan relies on annual FDG-PET/CT, which entails significant cumulative radiation and is not recommended for routine monitoring per the provided principles. Finally, it incorrectly dismisses ultrasound, a valuable and low-risk tool.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4839770"}]}
