Stabilizing the tetramer reduces the equilibrium production of the monomeric, aggregation-competent species. Consider a simplified, thermodynamically controlled two-state scheme in which the rate-limiting step is the dissociation of the native TTR tetramer into an amyloidogenic subunit, and assume the amyloidogenic monomer fraction is small so that its steady-state concentration is proportional to the dissociation equilibrium constant.

Therefore, the derivation of a solution can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe Mayo 2012 staging system for AL amyloidosis stratifies patients based on the number of biomarkers that exceed specific thresholds. The system uses three key biomarkers.\n\n**1. Define the Staging Criteria:**\nThe thresholds for the biomarkers in the Mayo 2012 system are:\n*   Cardiac Troponin T (cTnT) $\\ge 0.025$ ng/mL\n*   N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) $\\ge 1800$ pg/mL\n*   Difference in involved vs. uninvolved serum free light chains (dFLC) $\\ge 180$ mg/L\n\nThe stage is determined by the total number of biomarkers exceeding these thresholds:\n*   Stage I: 0 biomarkers elevated.\n*   Stage II: 1 biomarker elevated.\n*   Stage III: 2 biomarkers elevated.\n*   Stage IV: 3 biomarkers elevated.\n\n**2. Apply Criteria to Patient Data:**\nWe will evaluate each of the patient's given biomarker values against the defined thresholds.\n\n*   **NT-proBNP**:\n    *   Patient's value: 2500 pg/mL.\n    *   Threshold: 1800 pg/mL.\n    *   Comparison: $2500 \\text{ pg/mL} > 1800 \\text{ pg/mL}$. This biomarker is **elevated**.\n\n*   **Cardiac Troponin T (cTnT)**:\n    *   Patient's value: 0.03 ng/mL.\n    *   Threshold: 0.025 ng/mL.\n    *   Comparison: $0.03 \\text{ ng/mL} > 0.025 \\text{ ng/mL}$. This biomarker is **elevated**.\n\n*   **Difference in Free Light Chains (dFLC)**:\n    *   Patient's value: 200 mg/L.\n    *   Threshold: 180 mg/L.\n    *   Comparison: $200 \\text{ mg/L} > 180 \\text{ mg/L}$. This biomarker is **elevated**.\n\n**3. Determine the Stage:**\nThe patient has 3 biomarkers (NT-proBNP, cTnT, and dFLC) exceeding their respective thresholds. According to the Mayo 2012 staging system, having 3 elevated biomarkers corresponds to **Stage IV**.\n\n**4. Prognostic Implications of Stage IV:**\nStage IV is the most advanced stage of AL amyloidosis, defined by dysfunction in both cardiac biomarkers and a high hematologic tumor burden. The prognosis is poor.\n*   **Median Overall Survival (OS)**: Published data for Stage IV patients reports a median OS of approximately 5.5 to 6 months. The range of 6–9 months is a reasonable and contemporary description.\n*   **Early Mortality**: The risk of early mortality (death within 3 to 6 months of diagnosis) is very high, often exceeding $30\\%$.\n*   **Transplant Candidacy**: The severe cardiac involvement, as evidenced by the markedly elevated cardiac biomarkers, significantly increases the risk of treatment-related mortality with aggressive therapies. Consequently, most patients with Stage IV disease are considered poor candidates for high-dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation (HDM-ASCT).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Mayo 2012 Stage $III$; exactly $2$ biomarkers exceed staging thresholds...**\n    Our analysis determined that the patient has 3 elevated biomarkers, not 2. The patient is Stage IV, not Stage III.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B. Mayo 2012 Stage $IV$; exactly $3$ biomarkers exceed staging thresholds, with median overall survival approximately $6$–$9$ months and very high early mortality; most patients are poor candidates for high-dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation due to advanced cardiac involvement.**\n    This option correctly identifies the stage as Stage IV based on 3 elevated biomarkers. The described prognostic implications—median overall survival of 6–9 months, very high early mortality, and poor candidacy for HDM-ASCT due to cardiac involvement—are all accurate and consistent with the established characteristics of Mayo Stage IV AL amyloidosis.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **C. Mayo 2012 Stage $II$; exactly $1$ biomarker exceeds staging thresholds...**\n    Our analysis determined that the patient has 3 elevated biomarkers, not 1. The patient is Stage IV, not Stage II.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Mayo 2012 Stage $I$; no biomarkers exceed staging thresholds...**\n    Our analysis determined that the patient has 3 elevated biomarkers, not 0.
