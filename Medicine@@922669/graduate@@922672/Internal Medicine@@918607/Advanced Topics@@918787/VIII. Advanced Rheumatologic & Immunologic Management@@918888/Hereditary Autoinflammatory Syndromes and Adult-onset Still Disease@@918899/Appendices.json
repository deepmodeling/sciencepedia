In this context, activated caspase-1 cleaves pro-interleukin-1 beta (pro-IL-1β) into mature interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and under conditions where substrate availability and downstream clearance are not limiting, the steady-state concentration of mature IL-1β is proportional to the activity of caspase-1. Assume a linear relationship between mature IL-1β and caspase-1 activity with a constant proportionality factor $k$ that is invariant between baseline and flare.

Suppose $k=2$ (arbitrary proportionality units) for this patient within the linear regime.\n\nUsing only the assumptions above and fundamental enzymology that, under first-order conditions with a constant proportionality factor, the product concentration scales linearly with active enzyme, compute the fold-change in mature IL-1β from baseline to flare, defined as\n$$\\text{fold-change}=\\frac{\\text{mature IL-1}\\beta\\ \\text{at flare}}{\\text{mature IL-1}\\beta\\ \\text{at baseline}}.$$\nProvide the exact value as a single number with no rounding.

All necessary constants and conditions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions.\n\nLet $C$ represent the steady-state concentration of mature interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). Let $A$ represent the activity of caspase-1. The problem states that under the given conditions, the concentration of mature IL-1β is proportional to the activity of caspase-1. This relationship can be written as an equation:\n$$C = k A$$\nwhere $k$ is the constant of proportionality. The problem states that $k$ is invariant between the baseline (quiescent) state and the flare state.

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) amplifies interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling, and IL-6 is a principal driver of hepatic synthesis of acute-phase proteins such as ferritin. Consider a patient with AOSD whose baseline steady-state serum ferritin concentration is $2{,}000$ ng/mL. Assume the following physiologic model: the serum ferritin concentration $F(t)$ follows a mass-balance in which hepatic synthesis is directly proportional to IL-6 signaling and systemic clearance is first-order with a constant rate. Interleukin-1 blockade is initiated and subsequently reduces IL-6 signaling by $0.60$ relative to baseline.

The described roles of IL-1, IL-6, and ferritin in the pathophysiology of AOSD are consistent with established medical science. The kinetic model, involving a production rate proportional to a stimulus and a first-order clearance rate, is a standard and valid approach in physiology and pharmacology to model substance concentrations at steady-state.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information: a baseline steady-state condition, a clearly defined change in one of the system's parameters (the synthesis-driving signal), and a constraint (constant clearance kinetics). This setup allows for the determination of a unique new steady-state.\n\nThe problem is objective and uses precise language. The term \"reduced by $0.60$ relative to baseline\" is unambiguous, meaning the new level is $(1 - 0.60)$ times the original level.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $F(t)$ represent the serum ferritin concentration at time $t$. The dynamics of $F(t)$ are described by a mass-balance differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Synthesis}) - (\\text{Rate of Clearance})\n$$\nAccording to the problem statement:\n- The rate of synthesis is directly proportional to the IL-6 signaling level, which we denote as $S$. Let the proportionality constant be $k_{synth}$. Thus, Rate of Synthesis $= k_{synth} S$.\n- The rate of clearance is a first-order process. Let the first-order rate constant be $k_{clear}$. Thus, Rate of Clearance $= k_{clear} F$.\n\nThe governing differential equation is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dt} = k_{synth} S - k_{clear} F\n$$\nAt steady state, the concentration of ferritin is constant, which implies that its rate of change is zero, $\\frac{dF}{dt} = 0$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the baseline condition. Let $F_0$ be the baseline steady-state ferritin concentration and $S_0$ be the baseline IL-6 signaling level. At this steady state:\n$$\n0 = k_{synth} S_0 - k_{clear} F_0\n$$\nThis gives the relationship:\n$$\nk_{synth} S_0 = k_{clear} F_0\n$$\nWe are given that $F_0 = 2000$ ng/mL.\n\nNext, we analyze the condition after the intervention with IL-1 blockade. The problem states that IL-6 signaling is reduced by $0.60$ relative to baseline. Let the new IL-6 signaling level be $S_1$.\n$$\nS_1 = S_0 - 0.60 S_0 = (1 - 0.60) S_0 = 0.40 S_0\n$$\nLet the new steady-state ferritin concentration be $F_1$. The clearance kinetics are held constant, so the rate constant $k_{clear}$ does not change. The synthesis proportionality constant $k_{synth}$ is also assumed to be an intrinsic property of the system and remains unchanged. At the new steady state:\n$$\n0 = k_{synth} S_1 - k_{clear} F_1\n$$\nThis gives the relationship:\n$$\nk_{synth} S_1 = k_{clear} F_1\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $S_1$ into this equation:\n$$\nk_{synth} (0.40 S_0) = k_{clear} F_1\n$$\n$$\n0.40 (k_{synth} S_0) = k_{clear} F_1\n$$\nFrom our analysis of the baseline steady state, we know that $k_{synth} S_0 = k_{clear} F_0$. We substitute this into the equation for the new steady state:\n$$\n0.40 (k_{clear} F_0) = k_{clear} F_1\n$$\nSince a steady state exists, there must be a clearance mechanism, which implies $k_{clear}  0$. We can therefore divide both sides of the equation by $k_{clear}$:\n$$\nF_1 = 0.40 F_0\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that under the given model assumptions, the steady-state ferritin concentration is directly proportional to the level of IL-6 signaling.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of the new steady-state concentration $F_1$ using the given baseline value $F_0 = 2000$ ng/mL.\n$$\nF_1 = 0.40 \\times 2000\n$$\n$$\nF_1 = 800\n$$\nThe new steady-state serum ferritin concentration is $800$ ng/mL.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{800}\n$$", "id": "4847035"}, {"introduction": "The diagnosis of autoinflammatory syndromes is often a complex process of weighing and combining multiple, non-definitive clinical findings.

We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has Adult-Onset Still’s Disease (AOSD). The problem provides the pretest probability of this event as $P(D) = 0.20$. Consequently, the probability that the patient does not have AOSD is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n\nThe problem states that three independent clinical criteria are present. Let these events be denoted by $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$.\n- $C_1$: Quotidian fever pattern is present.\n- $C_2$: Evanescent salmon-pink rash is present.\n- $C_3$: Markedly elevated ferritin concentration is present.\n\nThe evidence, $E$, is the conjunction of these three observations: $E = C_1 \\cap C_2 \\cap C_3$. We are asked to find the posterior probability of AOSD given this evidence, which is $P(D|E)$.\n\nThe relationship between probability and odds is fundamental. The pretest odds, $O_{pre}$, are defined as the ratio of the probability of having the disease to the probability of not having it:\n$$O_{pre} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} = \\frac{0.20}{0.80} = 0.25$$\n\nBayes' theorem in odds form states that the posterior odds, $O_{post}$, are the product of the pretest odds and the likelihood ratio ($LR$) of the evidence:\n$$O_{post} = O_{pre} \\times LR(E)$$\nwhere $O_{post} = \\frac{P(D|E)}{P(D^c|E)}$ and $LR(E) = \\frac{P(E|D)}{P(E|D^c)}$.\n\nThe problem provides the positive likelihood ratios ($LR+$) for each individual criterion.
