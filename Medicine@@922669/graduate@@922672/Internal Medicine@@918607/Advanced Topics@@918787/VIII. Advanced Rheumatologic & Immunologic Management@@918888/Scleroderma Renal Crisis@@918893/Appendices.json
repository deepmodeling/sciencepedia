Report only the computed decimal fraction as your final answer.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. It presents a clinically realistic scenario requiring the application of a fundamental mathematical definition and subsequent interpretation using established medical guidelines.\n\nThe initial step is to compute the fractional increase in serum creatinine. Let $C_{base}$ be the baseline serum creatinine and $C_{adm}$ be the serum creatinine on admission. The problem provides the following values:\n$$ C_{base} = 1.2\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL} $$\n$$ C_{adm} = 1.8\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL} $$\n\nThe absolute increase in serum creatinine, denoted as $\\Delta C$, is the difference between the admission value and the baseline value:\n$$ \\Delta C = C_{adm} - C_{base} = 1.8\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL} - 1.2\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL} = 0.6\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL} $$\n\nThe fractional increase, which we will denote by $f_{\\text{inc}}$, is defined as the ratio of the absolute increase to the original baseline value. This provides a unitless measure of the relative change.\n$$ f_{\\text{inc}} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{C_{base}} = \\frac{C_{adm} - C_{base}}{C_{base}} $$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into this expression yields:\n$$ f_{\\text{inc}} = \\frac{1.8 - 1.2}{1.2} = \\frac{0.6}{1.2} $$\n\nPerforming the division gives the exact decimal value:\n$$ f_{\\text{inc}} = 0.5 $$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. To express $0.5$ with three significant figures, we append trailing zeros.\n$$ f_{\\text{inc}} \\approx 0.500 $$\n\nThe second part of the task requires a qualitative reasoning based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). The KDIGO guidelines define and stage AKI based on changes in serum creatinine or urine output. Focusing on the serum creatinine criteria, AKI is defined as an increase in serum creatinine ($\\text{SCr}$) by $\\geq 0.3\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$ within $48$ hours, or an increase to $\\geq 1.5$ times baseline which is known or presumed to have occurred within the prior $7$ days.\n\nIn this case, the patient's serum creatinine increased by $\\Delta C = 0.6\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$ over a period of $24$ hours. This absolute increase is greater than the threshold of $0.3\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$ within $48$ hours, thus satisfying the definition of AKI.\n\nTo stage the AKI, we evaluate the magnitude of the increase relative to baseline. The ratio of the admission creatinine to the baseline creatinine is:\n$$ \\frac{C_{adm}}{C_{base}} = \\frac{1.8\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}}{1.2\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}} = 1.5 $$\nAccording to the KDIGO staging criteria:\n- **Stage 1**: Increase in $\\text{SCr}$ to $1.5-1.9$ times baseline.\n- **Stage 2**: Increase in $\\text{SCr}$ to $2.0-2.9$ times baseline.\n- **Stage 3**: Increase in $\\text{SCr}$ to $\\geq 3.0$ times baseline, or increase in $\\text{SCr}$ to $\\geq 4.0\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$, or initiation of renal replacement therapy.\n\nThe patient's creatinine level has risen to exactly $1.5$ times the baseline value. This meets the minimum threshold for Stage $1$ AKI. Therefore, based on the provided data, the patient's condition would be classified as Stage $1$ Acute Kidney Injury. This formal staging is critical in the context of scleroderma renal crisis, as it quantifies the severity of the acute kidney insult and helps guide the urgency and intensity of treatment, which typically involves aggressive blood pressure control with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.\n\nThe final answer required is only the numerical value of the fractional increase.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.500}$$", "id": "4895563"}, {"introduction": "While classic SRC presents with malignant hypertension, a clinically significant subset of patients are normotensive, posing a major diagnostic challenge.

Prerenal azotemia is a functional response to decreased kidney perfusion, characterized by avid sodium and water retention (leading to a low fractional excretion of sodium, FENa $ 1\\%$) but without intrinsic kidney or hematologic damage. In contrast, SRC is a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) characterized by physical damage to small blood vessels, which causes both intrinsic acute kidney injury (AKI) and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). The key to diagnosis is identifying the markers of MAHA.\n- **MAHA Markers**: These include schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells) on a peripheral smear, thrombocytopenia (low platelets) due to consumption in microthrombi, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from hemolysis, and low haptoglobin (consumed by free hemoglobin).\n- **Distinguishing TMAs**: SRC must also be distinguished from other TMAs like thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which is caused by a severe deficiency of the ADAMTS13 enzyme (activity $ 10\\%$). In SRC, ADAMTS13 activity is typically normal or near-normal.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n*   **Option B** shows classic prerenal azotemia: a low FENa ($\\approx 0.24\\%$), an elevated BUN/creatinine ratio ($\\approx 23.5$), and a complete absence of MAHA markers. This is the main distractor.\n*   **Option C** shows evidence of MAHA, but the high FENa ($\\approx 3.6\\%$) suggests established acute tubular necrosis (ATN) rather than a purely prerenal state. While this can occur in SRC, it doesn't represent the initial diagnostic challenge of distinguishing from prerenal azotemia.\n*   **Option D** shows clear MAHA, but the ADAMTS13 activity of 4% is diagnostic of TTP, a different disease.\n*   **Option A** presents the most specific and diagnostically challenging picture of normotensive SRC. It combines a \"prerenal\" urine profile (FENa $\\approx 0.13\\%$) with florid markers of MAHA (schistocytes, thrombocytopenia, high LDH, low haptoglobin). The near-normal ADAMTS13 activity (65%) effectively rules out TTP.
