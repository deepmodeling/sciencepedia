It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient, consistent information to derive a solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two main components: first, the derivation and calculation of the expected proportion of heterozygous carriers for the Factor V Leiden variant using the Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) framework; second, a critical assessment of the HWE assumptions in the given context.\n\nPart 1: Derivation and Calculation of Heterozygote Proportion\n\nThe Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium principle describes the relationship between allele frequencies and genotype frequencies in a population that meets a specific set of idealized conditions. The fundamental assumption is the random union of gametes.\n\nLet the two alleles for the Factor V gene be the variant allele (Factor V Leiden) and the wild-type allele.\nLet the frequency of the variant allele in the population's gene pool be $p$.\nLet the frequency of the wild-type allele in the population's gene pool be $q$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n$p = 0.05$\n$q = 0.95$\n\nIt is a necessary condition that the sum of allele frequencies for a given locus equals $1$. Indeed, $p + q = 0.05 + 0.95 = 1$.\n\nWe assume random mating, which implies that the probability of a zygote receiving a particular allele from a parent is equal to that allele's frequency in the population. The genotype of an offspring is determined by the combination of one allele from the male parent and one from the female parent. The frequencies of the resulting genotypes can be calculated as follows:\n\n1.  The frequency of homozygous variant individuals (genotype AA, where A is the Factor V Leiden allele) is the probability that both the sperm and the egg carry the variant allele. This probability is $p \\times p = p^2$.\n2.  The frequency of homozygous wild-type individuals (genotype aa, where a is the wild-type allele) is the probability that both the sperm and the egg carry the wild-type allele. This probability is $q \\times q = q^2$.\n3.  The frequency of heterozygous individuals (genotype Aa) can occur in two ways:\n    a. A variant allele (A) from the father and a wild-type allele (a) from the mother. The probability is $p \\times q$.\n    b. A wild-type allele (a) from the father and a variant allele (A) from the mother. The probability is $q \\times p$.\n    The total frequency of heterozygous carriers is the sum of these probabilities: $pq + qp = 2pq$.\n\nThe sum of the genotype frequencies must equal $1$: $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = (p+q)^2 = 1^2 = 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected proportion of heterozygous carriers, which corresponds to the $2pq$ term. Substituting the given allele frequencies:\nProportion of heterozygotes $= 2pq = 2 \\times (0.05) \\times (0.95)$\n$2 \\times 0.05 = 0.10$\n$0.10 \\times 0.95 = 0.095$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $0.095$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $0.09500$.\n\nPart 2: Assessment of HWE Assumptions and Accuracy of the Calculated Value\n\nThe HWE model is based on several key assumptions:\n1.  **Large population size:** The problem specifies \"a large urban cohort,\" so the assumption of no genetic drift is plausible.\n2.  **No mutation:** The rate of new mutations at the Factor V locus is extremely low and can be considered negligible for calculating genotype frequencies in a single generation. This assumption is plausible.\n3.  **Random mating (panmixia):** Mating is generally random with respect to a specific unexpressed or unknown genetic marker like Factor V Leiden. Individuals are typically unaware of their carrier status and do not select partners based on it. This assumption is likely met.\n4.  **No migration (gene flow):** This assumption is questionable. An \"urban cohort\" in a modern setting is often an admixture of various populations, even if it is \"predominantly European descent.\" European populations themselves show a cline in Factor V Leiden frequency. If the cohort is a mixture of subpopulations with different allele frequencies that have not yet fully interbred (population stratification), the HWE principle will be violated. This phenomenon, known as the Wahlund effect, leads to a deficit of heterozygotes compared to the HWE expectation calculated from the average allele frequency of the entire cohort. This would make the calculated value an **overestimate**.\n5.  **No natural selection:** This assumption is the most tenuous. Factor V Leiden confers an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). This risk is significant for heterozygotes and much higher for homozygotes. VTE can be fatal (e.g., pulmonary embolism), especially in the context of other risk factors like surgery, trauma, or pregnancy. This constitutes negative selection, which would tend to reduce the frequency of individuals carrying the allele in an adult cohort compared to the frequency at birth predicted by HWE. This effect would also make the calculated value an **overestimate** of the prevalence in adults. Conversely, some hypotheses suggest a heterozygote advantage (a form of balancing selection), such as reduced blood loss during childbirth or trauma, which could have historically helped maintain the allele in the population. However, in a modern setting with advanced medical care, the negative selective pressure from thrombosis likely outweighs any potential advantage.\n\n**Conclusion on the computed value:**\nBoth population stratification (a highly likely scenario in an urban cohort) and negative selection (a known clinical feature of the condition) would lead to an observed frequency of heterozygotes that is lower than the value predicted by the ideal HWE model. Therefore, the computed value of $0.09500$ is most likely an **overestimate** of the true proportion of heterozygous carriers in this specific adult cohort.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.09500}\n$$", "id": "4856918"}, {"introduction": "Clinical practice is an exercise in probabilistic reasoning, where we continuously update our assessment of a patient's condition based on new evidence.
