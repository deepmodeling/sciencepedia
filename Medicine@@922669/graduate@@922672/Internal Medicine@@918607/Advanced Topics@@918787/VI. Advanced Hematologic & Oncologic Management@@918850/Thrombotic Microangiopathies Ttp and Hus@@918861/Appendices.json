It is self-contained, scientifically grounded in medical diagnostics and probability theory, and mathematically consistent. All necessary data are provided to compute the requested quantity.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the post-test probability of a patient having immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) given a positive test result. This is a classic application of conditional probability, often framed using Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $D$: The event that a patient has immune-mediated TTP.\n- $D^c$: The event that a patient does not have TTP.\n- $T$: The event that a patient has a positive test result, defined as a PLASMIC score greater than or equal to $6$.\n- $T^c$: The event that a patient has a negative test result, defined as a PLASMIC score less than $6$.\n\nThe quantity we need to compute is the conditional probability $P(D|T)$, which represents the probability of having the disease $D$ given that a positive test result $T$ has been observed.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we extract the following data for the cohort of $N = 200$ patients:\n- The total number of patients with TTP is $70$. This corresponds to the count of event $D$, so $N(D) = 70$.\n- The total number of patients without TTP is $130$. This corresponds to the count of event $D^c$, so $N(D^c) = 130$. We can verify that $N(D) + N(D^c) = 70 + 130 = 200 = N$.\n- The number of TTP cases with a PLASMIC score $\\ge 6$ (a positive test) is $63$. This corresponds to the count of the intersection of events $D$ and $T$, so $N(D \\cap T) = 63$. These are the True Positives (TP).\n- The number of non-TTP cases with a PLASMIC score $\\ge 6$ is $26$. This corresponds to the count of the intersection of events $D^c$ and $T$, so $N(D^c \\cap T) = 26$. These are the False Positives (FP).\n\nThe fundamental definition of conditional probability is $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$. In our context, this is:\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(T)}\n$$\nThe probabilities can be calculated from the counts in the reference population:\n- The probability of a patient having both TTP and a positive test is $P(D \\cap T) = \\frac{N(D \\cap T)}{N} = \\frac{63}{200}$.\n- The probability of a patient having a positive test, $P(T)$, can be found by considering all patients who tested positive, regardless of their disease status. The total number of patients with a positive test is the sum of True Positives and False Positives:\n$$\nN(T) = N(D \\cap T) + N(D^c \\cap T) = 63 + 26 = 89\n$$\nTherefore, the probability of a randomly selected patient from this cohort having a positive test is:\n$$\nP(T) = \\frac{N(T)}{N} = \\frac{89}{200}\n$$\nNow we can compute the post-test probability $P(D|T)$:\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(T)} = \\frac{\\frac{63}{200}}{\\frac{89}{200}} = \\frac{63}{89}\n$$\nAlternatively, and perhaps more intuitively, we can restrict our sample space to only those patients who had a positive test. The total number of such patients is $N(T) = 89$. Within this group of $89$ patients, the number who actually have TTP is $N(D \\cap T) = 63$. Thus, the probability that a patient has TTP, given that they are in this group (i.e., they tested positive), is the ratio of these counts:\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{\\text{Number of patients with disease and positive test}}{\\text{Total number of patients with positive test}} = \\frac{N(D \\cap T)}{N(T)} = \\frac{63}{89}\n$$\nBoth approaches yield the same result. The problem requires the answer as a fraction in simplest terms. To check if $\\frac{63}{89}$ can be simplified, we find the prime factors of the numerator and denominator.\nThe prime factorization of the numerator is $63 = 3^2 \\times 7$.\nThe denominator, $89$, is not divisible by $3$ (since the sum of its digits, $8+9=17$, is not divisible by $3$) nor by $7$ (since $89 = 12 \\times 7 + 5$). In fact, $89$ is a prime number.\nTherefore, the fraction $\\frac{63}{89}$ is in its simplest form.\n\nThe pretest probability of TTP in this population was $P(D) = \\frac{70}{200} = \\frac{7}{20} = 0.35$. After observing a positive test result, the updated probability (post-test probability) is $\\frac{63}{89} \\approx 0.7079$, which demonstrates a significant increase in the likelihood of disease, as expected from a clinically useful test.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{63}{89}}$$", "id": "4904881"}, {"introduction": "Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is the cornerstone of treatment for immune TTP, working by removing pathogenic autoantibodies and replenishing functional A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease with Thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13).
