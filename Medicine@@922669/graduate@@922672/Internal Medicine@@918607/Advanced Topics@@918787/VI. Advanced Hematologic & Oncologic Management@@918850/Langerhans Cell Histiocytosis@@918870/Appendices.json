This exercise bridges the gap between modern genomic diagnostics and cellular biology. By working from first principles, you will learn to translate a variant allele frequency (VAF) from a bulk tissue sequencing report into a quantitative estimate of the fraction of pathologically active cells, a critical skill for interpreting molecular pathology in the era of precision oncology [@problem_id:4861890].", "problem": "A clinician is evaluating a patient with Langerhans cell histiocytosis, a clonal myeloid neoplasm in which constitutive activation of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway through the B-Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma (BRAF) V600E mutation drives extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in mutant cells. In a bulk tissue specimen, high-depth sequencing reports a *BRAF* V600E variant allele frequency of 0.25. Independent histopathologic quantitation estimates the tumor purity (fraction of lesional myeloid cells among all nucleated cells in the specimen) as 0.40. Assume a diploid genome, heterozygosity of the mutation in the cells that carry it, absence of the mutation in non-lesional cells, and that ERK is fully active in all mutant cells and inactive in all non-mutant cells.\n\nUsing only the core definitions that (i) variant allele frequency is the fraction of sequencing reads carrying the mutant allele among all allelic reads in the bulk mixture and (ii) each diploid cell contributes two alleles, derive from first principles the relationship between the observed variant allele frequency and the fraction of ERK-active cells in the specimen. Then, use the provided values to calculate the predicted fraction of ERK-active cells in the specimen as a decimal. Express your final answer as a decimal fraction. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a relationship between the variant allele frequency (VAF) of a heterozygous mutation and the fraction of cells in a sample that harbor this mutation, followed by a calculation using provided data. The core of this problem rests on a clear, first-principles definition of VAF in the context of a mixed population of cells.\n\nLet us define the relevant variables as follows:\n- $f_{VAF}$ is the variant allele frequency of the *BRAF* V600E mutation.\n- $f_{ERK}$ is the fraction of ERK-active cells in the specimen.\n- $f_{M}$ is the fraction of mutant cells (cells carrying the *BRAF* V600E mutation) among all nucleated cells.\n- $P_{T}$ is the tumor purity, defined as the fraction of lesional myeloid cells among all nucleated cells.\n- $N$ is the total number of nucleated cells in the bulk tissue specimen.\n\nThe problem states that \"ERK is fully active in all mutant cells and inactive in all non-mutant cells.\" This directly links the biological activity (ERK phosphorylation) to the genetic status (presence of the mutation). Therefore, the fraction of ERK-active cells is identical to the fraction of mutant cells:\n$$f_{ERK} = f_{M}$$\nOur task is to derive the relationship between $f_{M}$ and $f_{VAF}$.\n\nThe variant allele frequency is defined as the ratio of the number of sequencing reads carrying the mutant allele to the total number of reads covering that specific genomic locus. Assuming unbiased sequencing, this frequency is equivalent to the proportion of mutant alleles in the total pool of alleles from the cells in the sample.\n$$f_{VAF} = \\frac{\\text{Total number of mutant alleles}}{\\text{Total number of alleles}}$$\n\nWe can express the numerator and denominator in terms of $f_{M}$ and $N$.\n- The number of mutant cells is $f_{M} \\times N$.\n- The number of non-mutant (wild-type) cells is $(1 - f_{M}) \\times N$.\n\nThe problem states to assume a diploid genome, meaning each cell contains two alleles for the *BRAF* gene.\n- Total number of alleles = (Total number of cells) $\\times 2 = 2N$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the mutation is heterozygous in the cells that carry it.\n- Each mutant cell contains 1 mutant allele and 1 wild-type allele.\n- Each non-mutant cell contains 2 wild-type alleles and 0 mutant alleles.\n- Therefore, the total number of mutant alleles in the sample is solely from the mutant cell population:\n  Total number of mutant alleles = (Number of mutant cells) $\\times 1 = (f_{M} \\times N) \\times 1 = f_{M}N$.\n\nNow we substitute these expressions back into the definition of $f_{VAF}$:\n$$f_{VAF} = \\frac{f_{M}N}{2N}$$\nThe total number of cells, $N$, cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding the direct relationship between the variant allele frequency and the fraction of mutant cells:\n$$f_{VAF} = \\frac{f_{M}}{2}$$\nSince we established that $f_{ERK} = f_{M}$, the relationship between the VAF and the fraction of ERK-active cells is:\n$$f_{ERK} = 2 \\times f_{VAF}$$\nThis equation represents the relationship derived from first principles as requested.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the predicted fraction of ERK-active cells using the provided values. The problem gives the *BRAF* V600E variant allele frequency as $f_{VAF} = 0.25$. Applying our derived formula:\n$$f_{ERK} = 2 \\times 0.25 = 0.5$$\nTherefore, the predicted fraction of ERK-active cells in the specimen is 0.5.\n\nIt is important to note that the problem also provides an estimated tumor purity of $P_{T} = 0.40$. In our idealized model, this would imply $f_{ERK} = f_{M} = P_{T} = 0.40$. This value is inconsistent with the prediction of $f_{ERK} = 0.5$ derived from the VAF. Such discrepancies are common in practice and may arise from factors not included in this simplified model (e.g., aneuploidy, copy number alterations, or inaccuracies in histopathologic estimation). However, the problem specifically instructs us to derive the relationship involving VAF and then use it to calculate a *predicted* value. This directs us to use the VAF as the input for our model-based calculation. The predicted fraction of ERK-active cells based on the genetic data is therefore 0.5.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5}$$", "id": "4861890"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis of LCH is suspected, the next step involves confirming it with objective pathological evidence. Immunohistochemistry for markers like CD1a is a cornerstone of diagnosis, but interpreting test results requires a quantitative understanding of their diagnostic power. This problem guides you through the calculation and interpretation of a positive likelihood ratio ($LR^{+}$), a key tool in evidence-based medicine. Mastering this concept allows you to move beyond a simple positive or negative result and appreciate how a given test result systematically modifies the probability of disease, thereby informing more rational clinical decision-making [@problem_id:4861919].", "problem": "A hematopathology consult is evaluating a suspected case of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) in an adult with lytic bone lesions. Immunohistochemistry for cluster of differentiation 1a (CD1a) is performed on the biopsy specimen. In a rigorously validated cohort, the CD1a stain has a sensitivity of 0.92 for LCH and a specificity of 0.88 among patients without LCH who undergo similar biopsies for mimicking conditions. Starting from the definitions of sensitivity as $P(T^{+}\\mid D^{+})$ and specificity as $P(T^{-}\\mid D^{-})$, where $T^{+}$ denotes a positive test and $D^{+}$ denotes disease present, derive the positive likelihood ratio $LR^{+}$ as a function of these conditional probabilities and compute its numerical value for this CD1a test. Then, interpret how this $LR^{+}$ would transform pre-test odds into post-test odds in general terms for clinical decision-making. Round your numerical answer to three significant figures. Express the final numerical value without units.", "solution": "The first task is to derive the positive likelihood ratio ($LR^{+}$) as a function of sensitivity and specificity. The $LR^{+}$ is defined as the ratio of the probability of a positive test result in a patient with the disease to the probability of a positive test result in a patient without the disease. Mathematically, this is:\n$$\nLR^{+} = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid D^{+})}{P(T^{+} \\mid D^{-})}\n$$\nThe numerator, $P(T^{+} \\mid D^{+})$, is the probability of a true positive, which is the definition of sensitivity.\n$$\n\\text{Sensitivity} = P(T^{+} \\mid D^{+})\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^{+} \\mid D^{-})$, is the probability of a false positive. We are given the specificity, which is the probability of a true negative, $P(T^{-} \\mid D^{-})$. For an individual without the disease (condition $D^{-}$), the test can only be positive ($T^{+}$) or negative ($T^{-}$). These are mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes. Therefore, the sum of their probabilities is 1.\n$$\nP(T^{+} \\mid D^{-}) + P(T^{-} \\mid D^{-}) = 1\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the false positive rate, $P(T^{+} \\mid D^{-})$:\n$$\nP(T^{+} \\mid D^{-}) = 1 - P(T^{-} \\mid D^{-})\n$$\nSince $P(T^{-} \\mid D^{-})$ is the definition of specificity, we have:\n$$\nP(T^{+} \\mid D^{-}) = 1 - \\text{Specificity}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for sensitivity and ($1-$ specificity) into the definition of $LR^{+}$, we arrive at the desired derivation:\n$$\nLR^{+} = \\frac{\\text{Sensitivity}}{1 - \\text{Specificity}}\n$$\n\nThe second task is to compute the numerical value of $LR^{+}$ for the given CD1a test. The problem provides:\n-   Sensitivity = 0.92\n-   Specificity = 0.88\n\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$\nLR^{+} = \\frac{0.92}{1 - 0.88} = \\frac{0.92}{0.12}\n$$\nThe calculation is:\n$$\nLR^{+} \\approx 7.666...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested gives:\n$$\nLR^{+} \\approx 7.67\n$$\n\nThe third task is to interpret how $LR^{+}$ transforms pre-test odds into post-test odds. This relationship is a form of Bayes' theorem, expressed in odds. The pre-test odds of disease are $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(D^{+})}{P(D^{-})}$, and the post-test odds after a positive result are $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{P(D^{+} \\mid T^{+})}{P(D^{-} \\mid T^{+})}$. The relationship is:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = LR^{+} \\times \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}}\n$$\n**Interpretation**: The positive likelihood ratio, $LR^{+}$, is the factor by which the pre-test odds of having a disease are multiplied to yield the post-test odds of having the disease, given a positive test result. An $LR^{+}$ greater than 1 increases the odds (and thus the probability) that the disease is present. An $LR^{+}$ of 7.67, as calculated for the CD1a test, indicates a moderately powerful positive test. A positive result from this test makes the diagnosis of LCH about 7.7 times more likely than it was before the test was performed. For clinical decision-making, such a result substantially strengthens the suspicion of LCH and would typically support proceeding with a diagnosis or further confirmatory steps, depending on the initial clinical suspicion (pre-test probability).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7.67}\n$$", "id": "4861919"}, {"introduction": "Following a confirmed diagnosis, the focus shifts to treatment.
