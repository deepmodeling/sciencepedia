It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the absolute neutrophil count ($ANC$) and its subsequent calculation using the provided data.\n\nLet $WBC_{total}$ be the total white blood cell count. The data provides $WBC_{total} = 1.6 \\times 10^{9}/\\text{L}$.\n\nLet $f_{seg}$ and $f_{band}$ be the fractional representations of the percentages of segmented neutrophils and band forms in the differential, respectively. The percentages are converted to fractions for calculation:\n$f_{seg} = 6\\% = 0.06$\n$f_{band} = 4\\% = 0.04$\n\nAccording to the first definition provided in the problem, the absolute count of any leukocyte subset, $AC_{subset}$, is the product of the total white blood cell count and the fraction of the subset.\nTherefore, the absolute count of segmented neutrophils, $AC_{seg}$, is:\n$$AC_{seg} = WBC_{total} \\times f_{seg}$$\nAnd the absolute count of band forms, $AC_{band}$, is:\n$$AC_{band} = WBC_{total} \\times f_{band}$$\n\nAccording to the second definition provided, the absolute neutrophil count, $ANC$, is the sum of the absolute counts of segmented neutrophils and band forms.\n$$ANC = AC_{seg} + AC_{band}$$\n\nTo derive a single expression for $ANC$, we substitute the expressions for $AC_{seg}$ and $AC_{band}$ into the equation for $ANC$:\n$$ANC = (WBC_{total} \\times f_{seg}) + (WBC_{total} \\times f_{band})$$\nBy factoring out the common term $WBC_{total}$, we arrive at the general expression for the absolute neutrophil count:\n$$ANC = WBC_{total} \\times (f_{seg} + f_{band})$$\nThis is the required derived expression. It states that the $ANC$ is equal to the total white blood cell count multiplied by the sum of the fractions of segmented neutrophils and band forms.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the $ANC$ using the provided data.\nThe total fraction of neutrophils is the sum of the fractions of its components:\n$$f_{seg} + f_{band} = 0.06 + 0.04 = 0.10$$\nThis means that $10\\%$ of the total white blood cells are neutrophils.\n\nSubstitute this and the value for $WBC_{total}$ into the derived expression:\n$$ANC = (1.6 \\times 10^{9}/\\text{L}) \\times (0.10)$$\n$$ANC = 0.16 \\times 10^{9}/\\text{L}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in units of $10^{9}/\\text{L}$ and rounded to three significant figures. The numerical value is $0.16$. To express $0.16$ with three significant figures, we add a trailing zero, resulting in $0.160$.\n\nThe computed absolute neutrophil count is $0.160 \\times 10^{9}/\\text{L}$. This value is critically low (a condition known as severe neutropenia, where $ANC < 0.5 \\times 10^{9}/\\text{L}$), which is an expected consequence of induction chemotherapy for AML.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.160}\n$$", "id": "4787527"}, {"introduction": "The diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has evolved beyond a simple blast percentage threshold, with modern classification systems integrating molecular and cytogenetic findings as disease-defining features.

The patient's symptoms, laboratory findings (cytopenias, blasts, Auer rods), immunophenotype (CD13, CD33), cytochemistry (MPO-positive), and cytogenetics ($\\mathrm{t}(8;21)$) are all classic features of a specific subtype of acute myeloid leukemia.

There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A definitive solution can be derived from the provided information and principles.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe core task is to apply the stated diagnostic principle for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to the patient's data. The principle establishes two independent pathways to an AML diagnosis:\n1.  A quantitative criterion: myeloblasts comprising $\\geq 20\\%$ of nucleated cells in the bone marrow or peripheral blood.\n2.  A genetic criterion: the presence of specific, recurrent genetic abnormalities that are considered to be disease-defining, irrespective of the blast count.\n\nLet's evaluate the patient's case against these criteria:\n\n1.  **Quantitative Criterion:** The bone marrow aspirate shows that blasts constitute $18\\%$ of nucleated cells. This value is below the $20\\%$ threshold. Therefore, based on blast percentage alone, the diagnosis of AML cannot be made. In the absence of other specific findings, a myeloid neoplasm with $18\\%$ blasts would be classified as a myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts-2 (MDS-EB-2).\n\n2.  **Genetic Criterion:** The patient's cytogenetic analysis confirms the presence of the translocation $\\mathrm{t}(8;21)(\\mathrm{q}22;\\mathrm{q}22)$, which results in the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion gene. This specific translocation is one of the \"recurrent, disease-defining genetic abnormalities\" listed in the WHO classification. The presence of $\\mathrm{t}(8;21)$, inv(16), or $\\mathrm{t}(15;17)$ is sufficient to diagnose AML, even if the blast count is less than $20\\%$. The patient's blasts are confirmed to be of myeloid lineage by the expression of myeloid markers (CD13, CD33) and positivity for myeloperoxidase (MPO). The presence of Auer rods is also definitive evidence of myeloid differentiation.\n\n**Conclusion:** Although the patient's blast percentage of $18\\%$ does not meet the quantitative threshold, the presence of the defining genetic lesion $\\mathrm{t}(8;21)$ in a patient with a myeloid neoplasm establishes the diagnosis of AML. The definitive diagnosis is AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities, specifically \"AML with $\\mathrm{t}(8;21)(\\mathrm{q}22;\\mathrm{q}22)$; RUNX1-RUNX1T1\". This is an acute leukemia requiring immediate, specific therapy. For a young patient (age 32), standard treatment involves intensive induction chemotherapy.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Diagnose acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with RUNX1–RUNX1T1 because $\\mathrm{t}(8;21)$ is a defining lesion that establishes AML irrespective of the $20\\%$ blast threshold; proceed with AML-directed induction therapy.**\nThis option correctly applies the genetic criterion from the foundational principle. It recognizes that $\\mathrm{t}(8;21)$ is a disease-defining abnormality that supersedes the blast percentage rule. It also correctly identifies the specific AML subtype and recommends the appropriate course of action, which is to initiate treatment promptly.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Diagnose myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with excess blasts because blasts are below $20\\%$; defer AML therapy until a repeat marrow confirms an increase to at least $20\\%$.**\nThis option incorrectly prioritizes the blast percentage criterion and ignores the definitive genetic finding. The presence of $\\mathrm{t}(8;21)$ explicitly defines the disease as AML, not MDS. Deferring therapy in a patient with AML is inappropriate and dangerous.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Classify as “myeloid neoplasm, not yet AML” because AML requires $\\geq 20\\%$ blasts; consider the $\\mathrm{t}(8;21)$ finding prognostic only, without diagnostic impact.**\nThis option incorrectly claims that AML universally requires $\\geq 20\\%$ blasts, which directly contradicts the principle provided in the problem statement. It also incorrectly relegates the $\\mathrm{t}(8;21)$ finding to having only prognostic significance, when in fact it has primary diagnostic importance.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Diagnose acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage, given blasts below $20\\%$ and the need for lineage-defining thresholds; delay specific therapy pending lineage maturation.**\nThis option is incorrect because the lineage is not ambiguous. The blasts are unequivocally myeloid based on multiple lines of evidence: MPO positivity, expression of myeloid antigens CD13 and CD33, and the presence of Auer rods. Delaying therapy is inappropriate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Treat as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) based on the presence of a recurrent translocation; begin all-trans retinoic acid immediately as the defining therapy.**\nThis option correctly understands that a recurrent translocation can define an acute leukemia subtype, but it misidentifies the specific translocation and corresponding disease. APL is defined by the $\\mathrm{t}(15;17)$ translocation and its fusion product, PML-RARA. The patient has $\\mathrm{t}(8;21)$. The treatment for APL, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), is highly specific and would be incorrect and ineffective for this patient's AML subtype.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4787604"}, {"introduction": "Choosing the optimal post-remission (consolidation) therapy in AML is one of the most complex decisions in hematology, requiring a careful balance between the risk of relapse and the risk of treatment-related mortality.
