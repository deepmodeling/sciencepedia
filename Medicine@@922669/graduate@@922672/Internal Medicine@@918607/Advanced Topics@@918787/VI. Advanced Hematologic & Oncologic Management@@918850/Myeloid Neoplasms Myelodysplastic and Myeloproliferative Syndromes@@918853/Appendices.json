A Complete Blood Count (CBC) with instrument differential reports a White Blood Cell (WBC) count of $11.8 \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$.

A concurrent $200$-cell manual leukocyte differential (which explicitly excluded nucleated red blood cells from the denominator) shows monocytes comprising $14\\%$ of white blood cells, with the remainder as neutrophils, lymphocytes, and rare immature granulocytes; blasts are reported as $5\\%$ and there are dysplastic changes in the myeloid lineage.

Automated hematology analyzers count all nucleated cells, which can lead to a falsely elevated WBC count if nucleated red blood cells are present. The formula to correct for this is a standard laboratory procedure. The diagnostic criteria for CMML are well-established by the World Health Organization (WHO). The provided data are clinically plausible and internally consistent. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Proceed to Solution**\n\nThe core principle is that the instrument-reported WBC count ($WBC_{inst}$) includes both true leukocytes and any nRBCs present. The manual differential percentage, however, is calculated based on a denominator of only true leukocytes. Therefore, the $WBC_{inst}$ must be corrected to obtain the true WBC count ($WBC_{corr}$) before calculating the absolute count of any leukocyte subpopulation.\n\nThe formula for the corrected WBC count is:\n$$WBC_{corr} = WBC_{inst} \\times \\frac{100}{100 + N_{nRBC}}$$\nwhere $N_{nRBC}$ is the number of nRBCs counted per $100$ instrument-reported white blood cells.\n\nGiven the values:\n- $WBC_{inst} = 11.8 \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$\n- $N_{nRBC} = 8$\n\nWe can substitute these into the formula:\n$$WBC_{corr} = (11.8 \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}) \\times \\frac{100}{100 + 8}$$\n$$WBC_{corr} = (11.8 \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}) \\times \\frac{100}{108}$$\n$$WBC_{corr} \\approx 10.925925... \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$$\n\nThis $WBC_{corr}$ represents the true concentration of leukocytes. The absolute monocyte count ($AMC$) is the product of this corrected WBC count and the fraction of monocytes from the manual differential. The manual differential reports monocytes as $14\\%$ of leukocytes, so the monocyte fraction, $f_{M}$, is $0.14$.\n\n$$AMC = WBC_{corr} \\times f_{M}$$\n$$AMC = (10.925925... \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}) \\times 0.14$$\n$$AMC \\approx 1.5296296... \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be in units of $10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$. We must perform a unit conversion. The relationship between the units is:\n$$1 \\times 10^{3}/\\mu\\mathrm{L} = 1 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ cells} / (10^{-6} \\text{ L}) = 1 \\times 10^{9} \\text{ cells}/\\mathrm{L}$$\nThis shows that a numerical value in $10^{3}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ is identical to the numerical value in $10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$.\nTherefore, the absolute monocyte count is:\n$$AMC \\approx 1.5296296... \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the result to four significant figures.\nThe fifth significant figure is $6$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$AMC \\approx 1.530 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$$\n\nThe final part of the task is to determine if the absolute monocytosis criterion for CMML is met. The WHO diagnostic criteria for CMML require a persistent absolute monocyte count of $\\ge 1.0 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$.\nOur calculated value is $AMC \\approx 1.530 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$.\nSince $1.530 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L} \\ge 1.0 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$, the diagnostic criterion for absolute monocytosis is met. The problem also gives that the monocyte percentage is $14\\%$, which is $\\ge 10\\%$, another CMML criterion. Given the other provided clinical and laboratory findings (negative $BCR-ABL1$, presence of dysplasia) and the stipulated assumptions, the patient's data are consistent with CMML.\n\nThe final answer is the numerical value of the absolute monocyte count in the specified units.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.530}$$", "id": "4872916"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis of a Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is established, the next crucial step is to determine the patient's prognosis to guide management.
