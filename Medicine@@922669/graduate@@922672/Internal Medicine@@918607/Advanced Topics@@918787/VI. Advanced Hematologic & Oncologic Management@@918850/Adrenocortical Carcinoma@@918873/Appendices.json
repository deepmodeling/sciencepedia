Dedicated adrenal imaging has been performed using Computed Tomography (CT). The unenhanced attenuation is measured as $U = 30$ Hounsfield units (HU), the peak portal-venous contrast-enhanced attenuation is $E = 100$ HU, and the delayed attenuation at $10$ minutes is $D = 70$ HU. In adrenal CT characterization, washout metrics are defined from first principles as follows: attenuation measured in HU quantifies x-ray attenuation relative to water, and the concept of washout expresses the fraction of initial contrast-related enhancement that has dissipated by a delayed time point. The relative washout is the proportion of the initial enhancement that has dissipated by the delayed phase relative to the initial enhancement itself, and the absolute washout is the proportion of the initial enhancement above the unenhanced baseline $U$ that has dissipated by the delayed phase.\n\nUsing these conceptual definitions and the measurements $U$, $E$, and $D$ provided, derive the expressions for the absolute washout and the relative washout in terms of $U$, $E$, and $D$, then compute their numerical values for this patient.

The provided measurements are the unenhanced attenuation, $U$, the peak portal-venous contrast-enhanced attenuation, $E$, and the delayed attenuation, $D$.\n\nThe given values are:\n- Unenhanced attenuation: $U = 30$ Hounsfield units (HU)\n- Peak enhanced attenuation: $E = 100$ HU\n- Delayed attenuation: $D = 70$ HU\n\nWe will first derive the mathematical expressions for absolute washout ($W_{abs}$) and relative washout ($W_{rel}$) from the conceptual definitions provided in the problem statement.\n\n**Derivation of Absolute Washout ($W_{abs}$)**\n\nThe absolute washout is defined as \"the proportion of the initial enhancement above the unenhanced baseline $U$ that has dissipated by the delayed phase.\" Let us formalize this statement.\n\n1.  The \"initial enhancement above the unenhanced baseline $U$\" represents the net increase in attenuation due to the contrast agent. This is calculated as the difference between the peak enhanced attenuation and the unenhanced attenuation:\n    $$ \\text{Initial Enhancement Above Baseline} = E - U $$\n\n2.  The amount of enhancement that has \"dissipated by the delayed phase\" is the decrease in attenuation from the peak enhancement to the delayed measurement. This is calculated as:\n    $$ \\text{Dissipated Enhancement} = E - D $$\n\n3.  The absolute washout is the \"proportion\" of the dissipated enhancement relative to the initial enhancement above baseline. This is the ratio of the two quantities derived above:\n    $$ W_{abs} = \\frac{\\text{Dissipated Enhancement}}{\\text{Initial Enhancement Above Baseline}} = \\frac{E - D}{E - U} $$\n\n**Derivation of Relative Washout ($W_{rel}$)**\n\nThe relative washout is defined as \"the proportion of the initial enhancement that has dissipated by the delayed phase relative to the initial enhancement itself.\"\n\n1.  The amount of enhancement that has dissipated is, as before:\n    $$ \\text{Dissipated Enhancement} = E - D $$\n\n2.  The dissipated enhancement is evaluated \"relative to the initial enhancement itself.\" This refers to the total measured attenuation value during the peak enhancement phase, which is $E$. This denominator is distinct from the one used for absolute washout, which specifically references the enhancement *above baseline*.\n\n3.  Therefore, the relative washout is the ratio of the dissipated enhancement to the peak enhanced attenuation value:\n    $$ W_{rel} = \\frac{\\text{Dissipated Enhancement}}{\\text{Peak Enhanced Attenuation}} = \\frac{E - D}{E} $$\n\n**Calculation of Numerical Values**\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values ($U = 30$, $E = 100$, $D = 70$) into the derived expressions.\n\nFor the absolute washout:\n$$ W_{abs} = \\frac{100 - 70}{100 - 30} = \\frac{30}{70} = \\frac{3}{7} $$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.4285714...$. Rounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ W_{abs} \\approx 0.4286 $$\n\nFor the relative washout:\n$$ W_{rel} = \\frac{100 - 70}{100} = \\frac{30}{100} = 0.3 $$\nTo express this value with four significant figures, we add trailing zeros:\n$$ W_{rel} = 0.3000 $$\n\n**Clinical Interpretation**\n\nThe problem provides the following thresholds for characterizing a lesion as a lipid-rich adrenal adenoma: absolute washout $\\ge 0.60$ and relative washout $\\ge 0.40$.\n\n-   Our calculated absolute washout is $W_{abs} \\approx 0.4286$. Since $0.4286  0.60$, this criterion is not met.\n-   Our calculated relative washout is $W_{rel} = 0.3000$. Since $0.3000  0.40$, this criterion is also not met.\n\nSince neither of the washout criteria for a lipid-rich adenoma is satisfied, the imaging characteristics of the mass are inconsistent with this diagnosis. The slow washout (low washout percentages) is characteristic of other lesions such as adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), pheochromocytoma, or metastasis. This finding, combined with the relatively high unenhanced attenuation of $U = 30$ HU (adenomas are typically $ 10$ HU), strengthens the suspicion for a non-adenoma pathology like ACC.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.4286  0.3000 \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "4596363"}, {"introduction": "While imaging can raise suspicion, the definitive diagnosis of adrenocortical carcinoma is made through histopathological examination of a resected tumor.

The patient's tumor exhibits a mitotic activity of $7$ mitoses per $50$ HPF. Since $7  5$, this criterion is met.

The pathology report explicitly confirms the \"Presence of atypical mitotic figures\". Therefore, this criterion is met. A score of $1$ is assigned.\n\n3.  **High Nuclear Grade:** The criterion is the presence of high-grade nuclei. The report describes the nuclear grade as \"consistent with high grade (predominantly pleomorphic nuclei with prominent nucleoli and irregular chromatin, compatible with Fuhrman grade $3$)\", which satisfies this condition. A score of $1$ is assigned.\n\n4.  **Diffuse Architecture:** The criterion is met if more than $33\\%$ of the tumor exhibits a diffuse growth pattern. The report states that the tumor has a \"diffuse growth pattern comprising $40\\%$ of the examined tumor area\". Since $40\\%  33\\%$, this criterion is met. A score of $1$ is assigned.\n\n5.  **Necrosis:** The criterion is the presence of tumor necrosis. The report identifies \"Confluent tumor necrosis present in multiple foci\". Thus, this criterion is met. A score of $1$ is assigned.\n\n6.  **Venous Invasion:** The criterion is the presence of invasion into venous structures. The report confirms \"Venous (large vessel) invasion present\". This criterion is met. A score of $1$ is assigned.\n\n7.  **Sinusoidal Invasion:** The criterion is the presence of invasion into sinusoidal spaces. The report states that \"Sinusoidal invasion is not identified\". Therefore, this criterion is not met. A score of $0$ is assigned.\n\n8.  **Capsular Invasion:** The criterion is the presence of tumor invasion through the adrenal capsule. The report confirms that \"Capsular invasion present; tumor penetration through the capsule with extension into pericapsular tissue\". This criterion is met. A score of $1$ is assigned.\n\n9.  **Low Clear Cell Proportion:** The criterion is met if the proportion of clear cells is less than or equal to $25\\%$. The report states that \"Clear cells comprising approximately $30\\%$ of the tumor\". Since $30\\%  25\\%$, the tumor does not have a low proportion of clear cells. This criterion is not met.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe overall stage group is determined by combining the individual T, N, and M categories. We will determine each category based on the provided information and the AJCC $8$th edition criteria for Adrenal Cortex tumors.\n\n**1. T (Primary Tumor) Category:**\n\nThe AJCC $8$th edition defines the T categories for adrenocortical carcinoma as follows:\n- **T1:** Tumor $\\le 5$ cm in greatest dimension, no extra-adrenal invasion.\n- **T2:** Tumor $ 5$ cm in greatest dimension, no extra-adrenal invasion.\n- **T3:** Tumor of any size with local invasion, but not into adjacent organs. This explicitly includes invasion into periadrenal soft tissues.\n- **T4:** Tumor of any size with invasion of adjacent organs (e.g., kidney, diaphragm, pancreas, spleen, liver).\n\nIn this case, the tumor is $6$ cm, which by size alone would suggest T2 if there were no invasion. However, the pathology report is definitive: \"invading periadrenal soft tissue\". According to the AJCC definition, invasion into periadrenal soft tissue classifies the tumor as T3, regardless of its size. The problem further states there is \"no invasion into adjacent organs\", which rules out T4. Therefore, the correct classification is **T3**.\n\n**2. N (Regional Lymph Nodes) Category:**\n\nThe AJCC $8$th edition defines the N categories as:\n- **N0:** No regional lymph node metastasis.\n- **N1:** Metastasis in regional lymph node(s).\n\nThe problem states that \"Two sampled regional lymph nodes are negative for metastasis.\" This is a pathological confirmation of the absence of nodal disease. Therefore, the correct classification is **N0**.\n\n**3. M (Distant Metastasis) Category:**\n\nThe AJCC $8$th edition defines the M categories as:\n- **M0:** No distant metastasis.\n- **M1:** Distant metastasis.\n\nThe staging workup, including scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, revealed \"no distant metastasis.\" Therefore, the correct classification is **M0**.\n\n**4. Overall Stage Group:**\n\nNow, we combine the TNM classification ($\\text{T3 N0 M0}$) to determine the overall stage group using the AJCC $8$th edition table.\n\n- **Stage I:** T1 N0 M0\n- **Stage II:** T2 N0 M0\n- **Stage III:** T3 N0 M0 or T4 N0 M0; or any T, N1, M0\n- **Stage IV:** Any T, Any N, M1\n\nThe patient's classification is **T3 N0 M0**. According to the table, this combination falls into **Stage III**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A. Stage II:** This corresponds to a T2 N0 M0 classification. A T2 tumor is defined as being greater than $5$ cm but with no extra-adrenal invasion. This patient's tumor demonstrates invasion into the periadrenal soft tissue, making it a T3 tumor, not a T2. Thus, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **B. Stage III:** This stage group includes tumors classified as T3 N0 M0. As derived above, the patient's tumor is T3 (due to periadrenal invasion), N0 (pathologically negative nodes), and M0 (no distant metastases). This matches the criteria for Stage III. Thus, this option is **Correct**.\n\n- **C. Stage IV:** This stage is reserved for any tumor with distant metastasis (M1). The patient's staging scans were negative for distant metastasis, making the classification M0. Thus, this option is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. Stage I:** This corresponds to a T1 N0 M0 classification. A T1 tumor is $\\le 5$ cm and confined to the adrenal gland. The patient's tumor is $6$ cm and has invaded the periadrenal fat, making it a T3 tumor, not a T1.
