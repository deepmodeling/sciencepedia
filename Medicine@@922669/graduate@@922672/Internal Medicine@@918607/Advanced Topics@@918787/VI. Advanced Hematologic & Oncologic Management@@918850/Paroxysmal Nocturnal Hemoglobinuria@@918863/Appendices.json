Flow cytometry demonstrates that a fraction $0.60$ of granulocytes lack binding of Fluorescent Aerolysin (FLAER), and a fraction $0.40$ of circulating red blood cells (RBCs) are CD$55$/CD$59$ deficient. Assume steady-state hematopoiesis, that granulocytes do not undergo complement-mediated destruction in circulation (so their GPI-deficient fraction reflects the PNH clone size), and that RBC pool composition reflects both production and survival. Let the normal RBC lifespan be $L_{n} = 120$ days.\n\nUsing only fundamental steady-state definitions of circulating pool size as the product of production rate and mean lifespan for each subpopulation, derive the dimensionless Hemolysis–Thrombosis Composite Index $S$, defined to capture the combined effect of clone size and hemolysis severity on prothrombotic risk as the product of the clone fraction and the fractional reduction in RBC lifespan of the GPI-deficient subpopulation relative to normal.

Consider the following well-tested epidemiologic facts and modeling assumptions grounded in the Cox proportional hazards framework: independent risk factors contribute multiplicatively to the hazard, and the natural logarithm of a multiplicative hazard reduces the composite effect to an additive scale. Use the factor-specific hazard multipliers below, which are derived from published effect sizes and chosen to be scientifically plausible for advanced risk modeling in PNH:\n\n- For LDH, for each increment of $0.5$ in the ratio $LDH/ULN$ above $1.0$, the hazard is multiplied by $1.3$.\n- For granulocyte clone size, for each $10\\%$ increase, the hazard is multiplied by $1.12$.\n- For thrombosis, the hazard is multiplied by $3.5$ if present and by $1$ if absent.\n\nDefine the composite hazard relative to baseline (baseline being $LDH/ULN = 1.0$, granulocyte clone size $= 0\\%$, and no thrombosis) under the assumption of independence of these risk factors.

This scenario, where inadequate drug exposure leads to loss of target inhibition and clinical failure, is the definition of **Pharmacokinetic (PK) breakthrough**.\n*   **Management:** The appropriate response is to increase drug exposure at the trough. This can be achieved by increasing the maintenance dose or shortening the dosing interval (e.g., to 12 days) to restore sustained complement suppression.\n\n**Analysis of Episode B:**\n*   **Key Data:** The patient experiences hemolysis during a viral infection despite a high trough eculizumab concentration ($120\\ \\mu\\text{g/mL}$) and a fully suppressed CH50 ($0\\ \\text{U/mL}$).\n*   **Interpretation:** The drug level is adequate, and the target (terminal complement pathway) is completely inhibited. The hemolysis occurs because the massive complement amplification triggered by the infection overwhelms the system, likely leading to C3b-mediated extravascular hemolysis, a pathway not blocked by C5 inhibitors. This is a classic example of **Pharmacodynamic (PD) breakthrough**, where the disease process intensifies beyond the control of an otherwise effective drug regimen.\n*   **Management:** Since the drug is already working at its target, increasing the dose long-term is illogical. The correct approach is to manage the infectious trigger. A supplemental or early dose of eculizumab can be considered to provide a safety margin during the acute illness, with reassessment afterward.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A correctly identifies Episode A as PK breakthrough and Episode B as PD breakthrough, and proposes the most appropriate, evidence-based management strategy for each.
