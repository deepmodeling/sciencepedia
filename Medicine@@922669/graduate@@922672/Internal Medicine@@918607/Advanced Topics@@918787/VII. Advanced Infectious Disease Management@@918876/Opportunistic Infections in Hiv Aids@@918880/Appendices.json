It provides all necessary data and relies on established principles in medicine and pharmacology. We can proceed with the calculation.\n\nThe objective is to compute the unitless ratio of the adjusted total daily trimethoprim (TMP) dose for *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PJP) treatment to the adjusted daily TMP dose for prophylaxis in the given patient.\n\nFirst, we must determine the patient's renal function to see if a dose adjustment is necessary. We use the provided Cockcroft–Gault formula to estimate the creatinine clearance ($\\mathrm{CrCl}$). The formula for males is:\n$$ \\mathrm{CrCl} = \\frac{(140 - \\text{age}) \\times \\text{weight}}{72 \\times S_{\\mathrm{cr}}} $$\nThe given patient parameters are:\n-   age = $60$ years\n-   weight = $62 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n-   serum creatinine ($S_{\\mathrm{cr}}$) = $2.5 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$ \\mathrm{CrCl} = \\frac{(140 - 60) \\times 62}{72 \\times 2.5} = \\frac{80 \\times 62}{180} = \\frac{4960}{180} = \\frac{248}{9} \\ \\mathrm{mL/min} $$\nNumerically, this is approximately $27.56 \\ \\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n\nNext, we apply the rule for renal dose adjustment. The problem states that for a $\\mathrm{CrCl}$ between $15 \\ \\mathrm{mL/min}$ and $30 \\ \\mathrm{mL/min}$, the total daily dose is reduced to $50 \\%$ of the usual dose. Since our calculated $\\mathrm{CrCl}$ of approximately $27.56 \\ \\mathrm{mL/min}$ falls within this range ($15  27.56  30$), a $50 \\%$ dose reduction is required for both the treatment and prophylaxis regimens. The dose adjustment factor is therefore $0.5$.\n\nNow, we calculate the usual (unadjusted) total daily doses of TMP.\nLet $D_{\\text{treat, usual}}$ be the usual daily dose for PJP treatment. The dosing is based on $15 \\ \\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$ of the TMP component.\n$$ D_{\\text{treat, usual}} = 15 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{day}} \\times 62 \\ \\mathrm{kg} = 930 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{day}} $$\nLet $D_{\\text{proph, usual}}$ be the usual daily dose for primary prophylaxis.

All provided values ($p_{0}$, $Se$, $Sp$) are plausible for the described clinical context. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation and Solution**\nWe are tasked with calculating the post-test probability of PJP, $P(D | T^+)$, which is the probability that the patient has the disease given a positive test result. We will derive this using Bayes' theorem.\n\nThe core definition of conditional probability gives us Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T^+)$, is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. It can be expressed using the definition of sensitivity:\n$$ P(T^+ | D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(D)} \\implies P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) $$\nSubstituting the given symbols, this is:\n$$ P(D \\cap T^+) = Se \\cdot p_0 $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result, regardless of the patient's true disease status. We can calculate this using the law of total probability, which states that we can sum the probabilities of this event over all possible (mutually exclusive) conditions:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\nWe have the following terms:\n- $P(D) = p_0 = 0.40$ (given pretest probability).\n- $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p_0 = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$.\n- $P(T^+ | D) = Se = 0.92$ (given sensitivity).\n- $P(T^+ | D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test in a disease-free patient, also known as the false positive rate. It is the complement of the specificity, $Sp$.\n$$ P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.78 = 0.22 $$\n\nNow we can assemble the full expression for Bayes' theorem using these components:\n$$ P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)} $$\nSubstituting the symbolic representations:\n$$ P(D | T^+) = \\frac{Se \\cdot p_0}{Se \\cdot p_0 + (1 - Sp)(1 - p_0)} $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement:\n$$ P(D | T^+) = \\frac{(0.92)(0.40)}{(0.92)(0.40) + (1 - 0.78)(1 - 0.40)} $$\nLet's calculate the terms:\n- Numerator (True Positives, $P(D \\cap T^+)$): $0.92 \\times 0.40 = 0.368$.\n- First term in the denominator (same as numerator): $0.368$.\n- Second term in the denominator (False Positives, $P(D^c \\cap T^+)$): $(0.22)(0.60) = 0.132$.\n- Denominator (Total Positives, $P(T^+)$): $0.368 + 0.132 = 0.500$.\n\nFinally, we compute the post-test probability:\n$$ P(D | T^+) = \\frac{0.368}{0.500} = 0.736 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P(D | T^+) = 0.7360 $$\n\nThe final step is to interpret this result in the context of the empiric treatment threshold, $T = 0.30$. The calculated post-test probability of PJP is $0.7360$. We compare this to the threshold:\n$$ 0.7360 > 0.30 $$\nSince the post-test probability of disease significantly exceeds the treatment threshold, the positive BDG test result provides sufficient evidence to justify initiating empiric treatment for PJP in this high-risk patient, pending definitive diagnosis via other means (e.g., induced sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage).

I will now validate its scientific and logical integrity.\n\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The presented case is a classic scenario in internal medicine and infectious diseases. A patient with advanced, untreated HIV (indicated by the very low CD4 count of $24$ cells/mm³) presenting with subacute neurological symptoms is at high risk for opportunistic infections of the central nervous system (CNS). Tuberculous meningitis is a well-described and serious complication in this population. The clinical features (headache, fever, confusion), examination findings (meningismus, cranial nerve palsy), and CSF profile (elevated opening pressure, lymphocytic pleocytosis, very high protein, low glucose relative to serum) are all highly characteristic of TB meningitis. The MRI findings are also consistent. The problem is firmly based on established medical science.\n\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The question asks for the \"single best, evidence-based management plan\". In clinical medicine, management decisions are guided by evidence from clinical trials and expert consensus guidelines. For a common and life-threatening condition like TB meningitis in HIV, well-defined management protocols exist. The problem provides sufficient detail to allow for a comprehensive management plan to be formulated and evaluated against current standards of care. A unique \"best\" answer, representing the standard of care, can be determined.\n\n3.  **Objective**: The language is objective and clinical. All data points are quantitative (e.g., CD4 count, CSF values) or standard clinical observations (e.g., neck stiffness, MRI findings). There is no subjective or opinion-based language.\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. It presents a realistic and complex clinical challenge that has a standard, evidence-based solution.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Management Plan\n\nThe management of suspected TB meningitis in a patient with advanced HIV/AIDS is a medical emergency that requires a multi-faceted approach. The optimal plan must correctly integrate several key components based on established evidence.\n\n1.  **Anti-tuberculous Therapy (ATT)**: Given the high index of suspicion and the life-threatening nature of TB meningitis, empiric treatment should be initiated immediately without waiting for definitive microbiological confirmation. The standard intensive phase regimen consists of four drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for $2$ months, followed by a continuation phase.\n\n2.  **Adjunctive Corticosteroids**: The use of adjunctive corticosteroids is a critical intervention. A landmark meta-analysis and subsequent clinical trials have shown that corticosteroids (specifically dexamethasone) reduce mortality in patients with TB meningitis, including those who are HIV-positive. The benefit is most pronounced in moderate to severe disease. The standard regimen involves an intravenous course of dexamethasone, typically starting at $0.4\\ \\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$ for HIV-negative patients (or $0.3\\ \\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$ for less severe cases), with some guidelines suggesting a fixed dose in HIV-positive patients, followed by a slow oral taper over $6$ to $8$ weeks. Abrupt discontinuation or a short course is ineffective and potentially harmful. It is imperative to first reasonably exclude cryptococcal meningitis (e.g., with a negative CSF cryptococcal antigen test, which is more sensitive than India ink), as steroids can worsen this condition.\n\n3.  **Timing of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**: This is a crucial and nuanced decision. While early ART (within $2$ weeks) is recommended for most opportunistic infections (including pulmonary TB) in patients with CD4 counts $ 50$ cells/$\\mu$L to reduce mortality and disease progression, TB meningitis is a major exception. Early initiation of ART in TB meningitis is associated with a higher risk of severe or fatal CNS Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS). Thus, guidelines recommend deferring ART initiation for several weeks after starting ATT. A common recommendation is to wait approximately $8$ weeks. This delay balances the risk of IRIS against the risk of other opportunistic infections due to profound immunosuppression.\n\n4.  **Diagnostic Strategy**: While empiric treatment is started, a definitive diagnosis should be aggressively pursued.\n    *   **CSF Analysis**: The sensitivity of CSF acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear is extremely low ($20\\%$). CSF mycobacterial culture is the gold standard but takes weeks. The most important rapid test is a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), specifically the Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay, performed on a large volume ($5$ mL, optimally $10-15$ mL) of centrifuged CSF to maximize yield. Sending CSF for mycobacterial culture in liquid media (e.g., MGIT) is also standard.\n    *   **Excluding Mimics**: It is essential to exclude other common CNS opportunistic infections. Cryptococcal meningitis is a primary consideration. Therefore, a CSF cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) test, which is highly sensitive and specific, must be performed. The negative India ink stain is insufficient to rule it out.\n\n5.  **Management of Drug-Drug Interactions**: Rifampicin is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, which metabolizes many ART drugs. When ART is eventually started, the regimen must be compatible with rifampicin.\n    *   **Integrase Inhibitors (INSTIs)**: The preferred modern approach is to use a dolutegravir (DTG)-based regimen. The interaction with rifampicin is managed by increasing the dolutegravir dose from $50$ mg once daily to $50$ mg twice daily.\n    *   **Protease Inhibitors (PIs)**: Ritonavir-boosted PIs are generally contraindicated with rifampicin due to a severe interaction that drastically lowers PI levels.\n    *   **Alternative**: In some settings, rifampicin may be substituted with rifabutin, a less potent enzyme inducer, which allows for use with PIs. However, the dose-adjusted DTG with rifampicin is now a widely accepted first-line strategy.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Initiate standard first-line anti-tuberculous therapy immediately; begin adjunctive dexamethasone intravenously at $0.4 \\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$ with a gradual taper over $6$ to $8$ weeks; defer ART initiation until $8$ weeks after starting TB therapy to reduce central nervous system immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) risk; perform CSF nucleic acid amplification testing with Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra on a high-volume ($10$ to $15$ mL) centrifuged sample, mycobacterial culture in liquid media, and quantify opening pressure; additionally send cryptococcal antigen to exclude co-infection; when ART is started, use a rifampicin-compatible regimen (for example, tenofovir/lamivudine/dolutegravir with dolutegravir dosed at $50$ mg twice daily).**\n\n- **ATT**: Correct. Immediate standard therapy is indicated.\n- **Corticosteroids**: Correct. The dose, route, and duration of the dexamethasone taper are consistent with evidence-based guidelines for reducing mortality in TB meningitis.\n- **ART Timing**: Correct. Deferring ART for approximately $8$ weeks is the standard recommendation for TB meningitis to minimize the risk of CNS-IRIS.\n- **CSF Diagnostics**: Correct. This describes the optimal diagnostic strategy: using a high-yield rapid molecular test (Xpert Ultra on high-volume CSF), the gold standard culture, and critically, testing for the key alternate diagnosis (cryptococcus).\n- **ART Regimen**: Correct. This describes the current standard-of-care ART regimen for a patient on rifampicin, managing the drug-drug interaction appropriately.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option accurately and comprehensively integrates all aspects of modern, evidence-based management for this complex clinical scenario.\n\n**B. Initiate standard first-line anti-tuberculous therapy immediately; avoid corticosteroids due to immunosuppression; start ART within $2$ weeks of TB therapy; for CSF diagnostics, rely on adenosine deaminase (ADA) alone and do not send Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra or mycobacterial culture.**\n\n- **ATT**: Correct.\n- **Corticosteroids**: Incorrect. Avoiding corticosteroids is directly contrary to evidence showing a mortality benefit, even in HIV-positive patients.\n- **ART Timing**: Incorrect. Starting ART within $2$ weeks is the recommendation for non-CNS TB, but is contraindicated in TB meningitis due to the high risk of fatal IRIS.\n- **CSF Diagnostics**: Incorrect. Relying on ADA alone is inappropriate; it is a non-specific test. Omitting Xpert Ultra and culture is a major diagnostic error.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Initiate standard first-line anti-tuberculous therapy plus empiric linezolid; give high-dose prednisolone $100$ mg daily for $3$ months without taper; start ART immediately with a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor despite rifampicin; rely on imaging findings and do not send CSF molecular tests or culture.**\n\n- **ATT**: Incorrect. Empiric linezolid is not part of standard first-line therapy and is reserved for suspected or confirmed drug-resistant TB.\n- **Corticosteroids**: Incorrect. Prednisolone is not the steroid of choice; dexamethasone is preferred. The dose is excessive, and the absence of a taper is dangerous.\n- **ART Timing/Regimen**: Incorrect. Immediate ART is contraindicated. Co-administration of rifampicin and a boosted PI is strongly contraindicated due to a severe drug interaction.\n- **CSF Diagnostics**: Incorrect. Imaging is not definitive. A microbiological diagnosis must be attempted via CSF analysis.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option contains multiple dangerous and erroneous recommendations.\n\n**D. Initiate standard first-line anti-tuberculous therapy; use dexamethasone for $1$ week only; start ART at $4$ weeks after TB therapy; for CSF diagnostics, send acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear only and do not send Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra or culture.**\n\n- **ATT**: Correct.\n- **Corticosteroids**: Incorrect. A $1$-week course of dexamethasone is far too short to provide a benefit; a slow taper over $6-8$ weeks is required.\n- **ART Timing**: Plausible, but the other errors are definitive. Deferral for $4$ weeks is within a range of expert opinion, but $8$ weeks is often preferred for severe disease.\n- **CSF Diagnostics**: Incorrect. Relying on AFB smear alone is wholly inadequate due to its very low sensitivity. Xpert Ultra and culture are essential.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Replace rifampicin with rifabutin to permit early ART with a boosted protease inhibitor and start ART at $1$ week; for CSF diagnostics, send India ink and cryptococcal antigen only, as imaging already suggests TB, and do not perform TB-specific CSF tests.**\n\n- **ATT/ART**: Incorrect. The primary error is starting ART at $1$ week (\"early ART\"), which is contraindicated in TB meningitis. While replacing rifampicin with rifabutin is a valid strategy to manage drug interactions in some contexts, it does not justify early ART initiation here.\n- **CSF Diagnostics**: Incorrect. While testing for cryptococcus is essential, failing to perform TB-specific tests (Xpert Ultra, culture) means forgoing the chance to confirm the suspected diagnosis.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.
