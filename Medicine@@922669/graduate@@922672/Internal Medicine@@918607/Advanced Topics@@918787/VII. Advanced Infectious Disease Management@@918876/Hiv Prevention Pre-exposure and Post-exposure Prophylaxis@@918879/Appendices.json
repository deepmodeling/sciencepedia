It is scientifically grounded in clinical pharmacology, well-posed with all necessary data provided, and objective in its language. The task is a direct application of a standard medical formula, the Cockcroft-Gault equation, to determine a patient's estimated creatinine clearance ($CrCl$) and subsequently decide on their eligibility for a specific medication based on a given threshold.\n\nThe Cockcroft-Gault equation is used to estimate creatinine clearance. The general form of the equation is:\n$$ CrCl = \\frac{(140 - \\text{Age}) \\times \\text{Weight}}{72 \\times SCr} $$\nwhere age is in years, weight is in kilograms ($kg$), and a patient's serum creatinine ($SCr$) is in milligrams per deciliter ($mg/dL$).\n\nThe problem specifies that the patient is a cisgender woman, for whom a correction factor of $0.85$ must be applied.

The calculated difference, $\\Delta = 0.01214 \\text{ g/cm}^2$, represents the additional precision-weighted composite BMD loss expected over one year with the TDF/FTC regimen compared to the TAF/FTC regimen for this specific patient profile and model.

It is greater than the standard error of measurement at both the hip ($\\sigma_{H} = 0.008 \\text{ g/cm}^2$) and the spine ($\\sigma_{S} = 0.010 \\text{ g/cm}^2$), indicating that the differential effect of the two drugs on bone is larger than the measurement \"noise\" of the densitometer. For a patient with concerns about bone health, even in the absence of high baseline fracture risk, this quantifiable difference provides strong evidence to favor the TAF/FTC regimen. The choice of TAF/FTC minimizes the iatrogenic bone loss associated with PrEP, aligning with the \"bone-sparing\" strategy often recommended in clinical guidelines for patients with risk factors for or established bone disease.

As given in the problem statement, the day-of-year index for this date is:\n$$d_1 = 15$$\n\n**Second Injection:**\nThe second injection is scheduled after a loading interval of $4$ weeks. The duration of this interval in days is:\n$$ \\text{Interval}_1 = 4 \\text{ weeks} \\times \\frac{7 \\text{ days}}{1 \\text{ week}} = 28 \\text{ days} $$\nThe day-of-year index for the target date of the second injection, $d_2$, is calculated by adding this interval to the index of the first injection:\n$$ d_2 = d_1 + 28 = 15 + 28 = 43 $$\n\n**Third Injection:**\nThe third injection is the first maintenance dose, scheduled $8$ weeks after the second injection. The duration of this interval in days is:\n$$ \\text{Interval}_2 = 8 \\text{ weeks} \\times \\frac{7 \\text{ days}}{1 \\text{ week}} = 56 \\text{ days} $$\nThe day-of-year index for the target date of the third injection, $d_3$, is calculated by adding this interval to the index of the second injection:\n$$ d_3 = d_2 + 56 = 43 + 56 = 99 $$\n\nThe day-of-year indices for the target dates of the second and third injections are $43$ and $99$, respectively.\n\n#### Determination of Grace Windows and Calendar Dates\n\nTo convert the day-of-year indices to calendar dates, we use the provided month lengths for the common year $2025$. We can construct a table of cumulative days at the end of each month:\n*   End of January: $31$ days\n*   End of February: $31 + 28 = 59$ days\n*   End of March: $59 + 31 = 90$ days\n*   End of April: $90 + 30 = 120$ days\n\n**Grace Window for the Second Injection:**\n*   Target date index: $d_2 = 43$.\n*   This index falls after day $31$ (end of Jan) and before day $59$ (end of Feb), so the date is in February. The day in February is $43 - 31 = 12$. The target date is **February $12$, $2025$**.\n*   The grace window is $\\pm 7$ days.\n*   Start of window index: $d_{2,start} = d_2 - 7 = 43 - 7 = 36$. The date is February ($36-31=5$), i.e., **February $5$, $2025$**.\n*   End of window index: $d_{2,end} = d_2 + 7 = 43 + 7 = 50$. The date is February ($50-31=19$), i.e., **February $19$, $2025$**.\n*   The grace window is from February $5$, $2025$ to February $19$, $2025$.\n\n**Grace Window for the Third Injection:**\n*   Target date index: $d_3 = 99$.\n*   This index falls after day $90$ (end of Mar) and before day $120$ (end of Apr), so the date is in April. The day in April is $99 - 90 = 9$. The target date is **April $9$, $2025$**.\n*   The grace window is $\\pm 7$ days.\n*   Start of window index: $d_{3,start} = d_3 - 7 = 99 - 7 = 92$. The date is April ($92-90=2$), i.e., **April $2$, $2025$**.\n*   End of window index: $d_{3,end} = d_3 + 7 = 99 + 7 = 106$. The date is April ($106-90=16$), i.e., **April $16$, $2025$**.\n*   The grace window is from April $2$, $2025$ to April $16$, $2025$.\n\n### Step 3: Clinical Implications of a Missed Dose\n\nThe problem requires an explanation of the clinical implications if a dose falls outside the grace window, grounded in pharmacokinetics and management strategies.\n\nThe $\\pm 7$-day grace window is not arbitrary; it is derived from the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of long-acting cabotegravir. CAB-LA is administered as an intramuscular injection, forming a depot from which the drug is slowly absorbed, resulting in a long terminal half-life. This property provides **pharmacokinetic forgiveness**, meaning that drug concentrations in the plasma remain above the minimum protective threshold—the protein-adjusted $90\\%$ inhibitory concentration (PA-IC$_{90}$)—for a period even if a dose is moderately delayed. The $\\pm 7$-day window is the clinically validated period during which efficacy for HIV prevention is not expected to be compromised.\n\nIf a patient receives a dose outside this window, particularly after the window has closed (a missed dose of more than $7$ days), there are two critical consequences:\n\n1.  **Loss of Protective Efficacy:** Plasma cabotegravir concentrations may fall below the PA-IC$_{90}$. This sub-therapeutic level of the drug is insufficient to prevent HIV acquisition. The patient is no longer considered protected by PrEP and is at risk of infection if exposed to HIV.\n\n2.  **Risk of Drug Resistance:** If an individual acquires HIV while having sub-therapeutic concentrations of cabotegravir in their system, the virus can replicate in the presence of the drug. This creates strong selective pressure for the emergence of viral strains with resistance mutations to cabotegravir. Since cabotegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), this can lead to cross-resistance to other drugs in the same class (e.g., dolutegravir, raltegravir, bictegravir), which are cornerstone components of modern antiretroviral therapy (ART). The development of INSTI resistance would severely compromise the patient's future HIV treatment options.\n\n**Labeling-Consistent Management Strategy for Missed Doses:**\nIf a maintenance dose is missed (i.e., it has been more than $9$ weeks since the last injection), clinical practice, consistent with product labeling and CDC guidelines, dictates a specific protocol:\n*   First, an HIV test must be performed to rule out seroconversion.\n*   If the patient is confirmed to be HIV-negative, a strategy to re-establish protective drug concentrations is required. This may involve resuming the every-$8$-week schedule as soon as possible or, for longer delays, re-initiating the loading phase (an injection immediately, followed by a second injection $4$ weeks later) before returning to the every-$8$-week maintenance schedule.\n*   Some protocols also recommend a \"bridge\" with daily oral PrEP (e.g., emtricitabine/tenofovir) to provide protection until the long-acting injectable regimen can be safely resumed. This is particularly important for individuals with ongoing high risk of HIV exposure.\n\nAdherence to the dosing schedule and its grace window is therefore paramount to ensuring the efficacy of CAB-LA PrEP and preventing the public health threat of drug-resistant HIV.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n43 & 99\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4848776"}]}
