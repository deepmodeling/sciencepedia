Express the final posterior probability as a decimal and round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the posterior probability of a patient having leptospirosis given a positive PCR test result. The derivation must begin from fundamental principles of probability, without the direct application of a pre-assembled formula such as Bayes' theorem.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant events based on the problem statement:\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has leptospirosis.\nLet $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have leptospirosis.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the PCR test result is positive.\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the PCR test result is negative.\n\nNext, we formalize the given information using probabilistic notation:\nThe pre-test probability of leptospirosis is given as $P(D) = 0.30$.\nThe probability that the patient does not have leptospirosis is the complement of $P(D)$, so $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\nThe sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease. This is a conditional probability: $P(T^+ | D) = 0.80$.\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease. This is also a conditional probability: $P(T^- | D^c) = 0.98$.\n\nThe objective is to find the posterior probability that the patient has leptospirosis given a positive test result, which is denoted as $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nWe start from the fundamental definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\nHere, $P(D \\cap T^+)$ is the joint probability that the patient has the disease AND the test is positive. $P(T^+)$ is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result.\n\nWe must calculate the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\nTo find the numerator, $P(D \\cap T^+)$, we use the definition of conditional probability for $P(T^+ | D)$:\n$$P(T^+ | D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(D)}$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the joint probability gives:\n$$P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | D) \\times P(D)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(D \\cap T^+) = 0.80 \\times 0.30 = 0.24$$\nThis value, $0.24$, represents the probability of a true positive result in the entire population of patients being evaluated.\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, $P(T^+)$. A positive test result can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: the patient has the disease and tests positive (a true positive), or the patient does not have the disease and tests positive (a false positive). We can express the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$, using the law of total probability by partitioning the event $T^+$ over the sample space $\\{D, D^c\\}$:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$$\nWe have already calculated the first term, $P(T^+ \\cap D) = 0.24$.\n\nTo find the second term, $P(T^+ \\cap D^c)$, we again use the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(T^+ \\cap D^c) = P(T^+ | D^c) \\times P(D^c)$$\nWe know $P(D^c) = 0.70$. We need to find $P(T^+ | D^c)$, which is the probability of a positive test given the patient does not have the disease (the false positive rate). The problem provides the specificity, $P(T^- | D^c) = 0.98$. Since a patient without the disease can either test positive or negative, the sum of these probabilities must be $1$:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) + P(T^- | D^c) = 1$$\nTherefore, the false positive rate is:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$$\nNow we can calculate the joint probability of not having the disease and testing positive:\n$$P(T^+ \\cap D^c) = P(T^+ | D^c) \\times P(D^c) = 0.02 \\times 0.70 = 0.014$$\nThis value, $0.014$, represents the probability of a false positive result in the population.\n\nNow we can compute the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap D) + P(T^+ \\cap D^c) = 0.24 + 0.014 = 0.254$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the values for the numerator and the denominator back into our original formula for the posterior probability $P(D | T^+)$:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{0.24}{0.254}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$P(D | T^+) \\approx 0.944881889...$$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(D | T^+) \\approx 0.9449$$\nThis is the posterior probability that the patient has leptospirosis after receiving a positive PCR test result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9449}$$", "id": "4862674"}, {"introduction": "In complex infectious diseases like leptospirosis, no single diagnostic test is perfect at all stages of the illness.
