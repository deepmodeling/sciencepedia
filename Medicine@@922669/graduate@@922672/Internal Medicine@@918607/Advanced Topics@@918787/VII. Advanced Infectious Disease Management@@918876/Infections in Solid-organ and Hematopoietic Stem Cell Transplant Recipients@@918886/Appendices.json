A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nLet us formally define the events of interest.\n- Let $D$ be the event that a patient has true invasive aspergillosis (the \"disease\" is present).\n- Let $D^c$ be the event that a patient does not have invasive aspergillosis (the complement of $D$).\n- Let $+$ be the event that the serum galactomannan assay yields a positive result.\n- Let $-$ be the event that the assay yields a negative result.\n\nFrom the givens, we translate the problem's descriptive terms into the language of probability:\n- The pre-test probability, or prevalence, is $\\Pr(D) = 0.15$.\n- The sensitivity is the probability of a positive test given the presence of the disease: $\\Pr(+ \\mid D) = 0.70$.\n- The specificity is the probability of a negative test given the absence of the disease: $\\Pr(- \\mid D^c) = 0.90$.\n\nOur objective is to calculate the positive predictive value (PPV), which is the posterior probability of having the disease given a positive test result, denoted by $\\Pr(D \\mid +)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability $\\Pr(D \\mid +)$ is given by:\n$$ \\Pr(D \\mid +) = \\frac{\\Pr(+ \\mid D) \\Pr(D)}{\\Pr(+)} $$\n\nThe numerator contains terms that are directly provided: $\\Pr(+ \\mid D) = 0.70$ and $\\Pr(D) = 0.15$. The product is the probability of having the disease AND testing positive, $\\Pr(+ \\cap D)$:\n$$ \\Pr(+ \\mid D) \\Pr(D) = (0.70) \\times (0.15) = 0.105 $$\n\nThe denominator, $\\Pr(+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result, regardless of the true disease status. We compute this using the law of total probability, which states that the probability of an event can be found by summing its conditional probabilities over a partition of the sample space. In this case, the sample space of patients is partitioned into those with the disease ($D$) and those without ($D^c$).\n$$ \\Pr(+) = \\Pr(+ \\mid D)\\Pr(D) + \\Pr(+ \\mid D^c)\\Pr(D^c) $$\n\nWe have the first term of this sum, which is $0.105$. We need to compute the second term, $\\Pr(+ \\mid D^c)\\Pr(D^c)$.\n\nFirst, we determine $\\Pr(D^c)$, the probability of not having the disease. Since $D^c$ is the complement of $D$:\n$$ \\Pr(D^c) = 1 - \\Pr(D) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 $$\n\nNext, we determine $\\Pr(+ \\mid D^c)$, the probability of a positive test in a patient without the disease. This is also known as the false positive rate. It is the complement of the specificity, $\\Pr(- \\mid D^c)$.\n$$ \\Pr(+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - \\Pr(- \\mid D^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the second term in the law of total probability expansion:\n$$ \\Pr(+ \\mid D^c)\\Pr(D^c) = (0.10) \\times (0.85) = 0.085 $$\nThis is the probability of not having the disease AND testing positive, $\\Pr(+ \\cap D^c)$.\n\nWe can now compute the total probability of a positive test, $\\Pr(+)$:\n$$ \\Pr(+) = 0.105 + 0.085 = 0.190 $$\n\nFinally, we substitute all computed values back into Bayes' theorem to find the positive predictive value, $\\Pr(D \\mid +)$:\n$$ \\Pr(D \\mid +) = \\frac{\\Pr(+ \\mid D) \\Pr(D)}{\\Pr(+)} = \\frac{0.105}{0.190} $$\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$ \\Pr(D \\mid +) = \\frac{0.105}{0.190} \\approx 0.55263157... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\Pr(D \\mid +) \\approx 0.5526 $$\n\nThus, for this patient population and test characteristics, the probability that a patient with a positive galactomannan test actually has invasive aspergillosis is approximately $0.5526$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5526}$$", "id": "4854045"}, {"introduction": "Transplant recipients are often on complex medication regimens, making drug-drug interactions a constant and critical concern.

It describes a well-documented and clinically critical drug-drug interaction. Tacrolimus is a substrate for the cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) family of enzymes and the P-glycoprotein efflux transporter. Rifampin is a potent inducer of both CYP3A and P-glycoprotein. This induction significantly accelerates the metabolism and clearance of tacrolimus, leading to subtherapeutic concentrations and a risk of graft rejection unless the dose is adjusted. The use of pharmacokinetic principles to guide this dose adjustment is standard clinical practice.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides the initial dose, the magnitude of the change in a key pharmacokinetic parameter (clearance), and a clear objective (maintain the same concentration). The assumptions of linearity, and constant bioavailability and dosing interval, render the problem uniquely solvable.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms, free from subjective or biased language.\n\n**Verdict**: The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\n**Step 3: Solution**\nThe fundamental principle of pharmacokinetics at steady state ($ss$) is that the rate of drug administration equals the rate of drug elimination. The average steady-state concentration ($C_{ss,avg}$) is directly proportional to the rate of dosing and inversely proportional to the drug's apparent clearance ($CL$). The rate of dosing can be expressed as the total daily dose ($D_{daily}$).\n\nThe relationship is formally given by:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\times \\text{Dose}}{CL \\times \\tau}$$\nwhere $F$ is the bioavailability, $\\text{Dose}$ is the dose administered per dosing interval $\\tau$.\nThe total daily dose, $D_{daily}$, is given by $\\text{Dose} \\times (\\frac{24 \\text{ hours}}{\\tau})$. For a dosing interval $\\tau = 12$ hours, the daily dose is $2 \\times \\text{Dose}$.\nMore simply, the average steady-state concentration is proportional to the total daily dosing rate divided by the clearance:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{\\text{Dosing Rate}}{CL} = \\frac{D_{daily}}{CL}$$\nassuming bioavailability is constant and absorbed into the definition of $D_{daily}$ and $CL$.\n\nIn a linear pharmacokinetic system with a fixed dosing interval, all concentrations across the steady-state profile, including the peak ($C_{max}$), average ($C_{avg}$), and trough ($C_{min}$ or $C_{trough}$), are directly proportional to the dosing rate and inversely proportional to the clearance. Therefore, to maintain a constant target trough concentration ($C_{trough}$), the ratio of the daily dose to the clearance must be kept constant.\n\nLet the initial state (before rifampin) be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final state (with rifampin) be denoted by subscript $2$.\n\nFor the initial state:\n$$C_{trough,1} \\propto \\frac{D_{daily,1}}{CL_1}$$\n\nFor the final state:\n$$C_{trough,2} \\propto \\frac{D_{daily,2}}{CL_2}$$\n\nThe problem requires maintaining the same target trough concentration, which means $C_{trough,1} = C_{trough,2}$.\nThis implies that the ratio of daily dose to clearance must be the same in both states:\n$$\\frac{D_{daily,1}}{CL_1} = \\frac{D_{daily,2}}{CL_2}$$\n\nWe are given the following information:\n- The initial total daily dose, $D_{daily,1} = 6.50$ mg/day.\n- Rifampin increases the clearance by a factor of $2$. Therefore, the new clearance $CL_2$ is twice the initial clearance $CL_1$:\n$$CL_2 = 2 \\times CL_1$$\n\nWe need to find the new total daily dose, $D_{daily,2}$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $D_{daily,2}$:\n$$D_{daily,2} = D_{daily,1} \\times \\frac{CL_2}{CL_1}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the known values into the equation:\n$$D_{daily,2} = D_{daily,1} \\times \\frac{2 \\times CL_1}{CL_1}$$\n\nThe term $CL_1$ cancels out, leaving:\n$$D_{daily,2} = D_{daily,1} \\times 2$$\n\nSubstituting the value of $D_{daily,1}$:\n$$D_{daily,2} = 6.50 \\, \\text{mg/day} \\times 2 = 13.0 \\, \\text{mg/day}$$\n\nThe initial dose is given to three significant figures ($6.50$). The multiplier $2$ is presented as a factor derived from clinical observation and for the purpose of this calculation can be treated as a number with sufficient precision not to limit the significant figures of the result. Thus, the final answer should be expressed to three significant figures.\n\nThe new required total daily tacrolimus dose is $13.0$ mg/day.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{13.0}$$", "id": "4854098"}, {"introduction": "Effective and safe drug therapy requires tailoring doses to individual patient physiology, particularly organ function.

A standard assumption for the normal creatinine clearance value will be made and explicitly stated. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to determine the appropriate daily-equivalent dose for a patient with impaired renal function by scaling from the dose for normal renal function, and then to reconcile this scaled dose with practical dosing guidelines.\n\nThe problem states two key proportionalities:\n$1$. The area under the curve (AUC) is proportional to the dose ($D$) divided by the systemic clearance ($\\mathrm{CL}$):\n$$ \\mathrm{AUC} = k_1 \\frac{D}{\\mathrm{CL}} $$\nwhere $k_1$ is a proportionality constant.\n\n$2$. For a renally eliminated drug, the systemic clearance is proportional to the creatinine clearance ($\\mathrm{CrCl}$):\n$$ \\mathrm{CL} = k_2 \\mathrm{CrCl} $$\nwhere $k_2$ is another proportionality constant.\n\nSubstituting the second relationship into the first gives:\n$$ \\mathrm{AUC} = k_1 \\frac{D}{k_2 \\mathrm{CrCl}} = K \\frac{D}{\\mathrm{CrCl}} $$\nwhere $K = \\frac{k_1}{k_2}$ is a combined constant. This equation establishes that for a given drug, exposure (AUC) is proportional to the ratio of dose to creatinine clearance.\n\nThe goal is to maintain the same target exposure (AUC) in the patient as in an individual with normal renal function. Let the subscript 'p' denote the patient and 'n' denote the normal reference case.\n$$ \\mathrm{AUC}_p = \\mathrm{AUC}_n $$\nUsing the derived relationship:\n$$ K \\frac{D_p}{\\mathrm{CrCl}_p} = K \\frac{D_n}{\\mathrm{CrCl}_n} $$\nThe constant $K$ cancels, yielding the dose-scaling formula:\n$$ D_p = D_n \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{CrCl}_p}{\\mathrm{CrCl}_n} \\right) $$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- The dose for normal renal function, $D_n = 900$ mg/day.\n- The patient's creatinine clearance, $\\mathrm{CrCl}_p = 35$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n\nThe problem does not specify the value for normal creatinine clearance, $\\mathrm{CrCl}_n$. We shall adopt a standard reference value for a healthy adult used in pharmacokinetic calculations, which is $\\mathrm{CrCl}_n = 120$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n\nNow we can calculate the theoretically ideal dose for the patient, $D_p$:\n$$ D_p = (900 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day}) \\times \\left( \\frac{35 \\, \\mathrm{mL/min}}{120 \\, \\mathrm{mL/min}} \\right) $$\n$$ D_p = 900 \\times \\frac{35}{120} = \\frac{900}{120} \\times 35 = 7.5 \\times 35 $$\n$$ D_p = 262.5 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day} $$\nThis is the dose, based on continuous scaling, that would theoretically produce the same drug exposure as the standard $900$ mg/day dose in a person with normal renal function.\n\nThe second part of the task is to reconcile this theoretical dose with the provided FDA guidelines and practical constraints. The patient's $\\mathrm{CrCl}$ is $35$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$, which falls into the FDA's specified range of $25$–$39$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$. The recommended dose for this category is $450$ mg every $2$ days.\n\nThe daily-equivalent dose recommended by the FDA is:\n$$ D_{FDA} = \\frac{450 \\, \\mathrm{mg}}{2 \\, \\mathrm{days}} = 225 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day} $$\nThe problem instructs that the final dose should \"not to exceed the recommended exposure category\" for the patient's $\\mathrm{CrCl}$. This means the exposure resulting from the final dose should not be greater than the exposure from the FDA-recommended dose of $225$ mg/day.\n\nOur calculated ideal dose is $D_p = 262.5$ mg/day.\nThe FDA-recommended dose is $D_{FDA} = 225$ mg/day.\n\nSince $262.5 > 225$, administering the theoretically scaled dose would result in a higher exposure (AUC) than is recommended by the FDA for this level of renal impairment. To comply with the instruction not to exceed the recommended exposure, the dose must be chosen to be less than or equal to the FDA guideline dose. The available tablet strength is $450$ mg, and the regimen of $450$ mg every $2$ days ($225$ mg/day) is a practical implementation that respects this exposure limit. Therefore, the correct reconciled dose is the one recommended by the FDA.\n\nThe final answer is the daily-equivalent dose in mg/day.
