The scenario, including the patient profile, treatment type (INSTI-based ART), RNA values, and diagnostic considerations, represents a common and realistic clinical challenge in HIV medicine. The provided definitions for virologic suppression, blips, and persistent viremia are consistent with established clinical guidelines (e.g., those from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, DHHS).\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a discrete dataset and a set of definitions, asking for a classification and the best subsequent action. The information is sufficient to arrive at a single best answer based on standard clinical reasoning in HIV management.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, clinical language, free from subjective bias or opinion.\n\nThe problem statement does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, complete, and relevant.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed with deriving the correct answer and evaluating each option.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\n1.  **Classification of the Virologic Pattern:**\n    The patient was previously suppressed (HIV-1 RNA $ 50$ copies/mL). The current series of measurements is $38$, $320$, $260$, and $170$ copies/mL.\n    -   The value at week $0$ ($38$ copies/mL) is below the clinical threshold for suppression ($50$ copies/mL), though it is detectable above the assay's limit ($20$ copies/mL).\n    -   The values at weeks $4$, $8$, and $12$ are all $> 50$ copies/mL.\n    -   According to the provided definition, an \"isolated 'virologic blip' is a single detectable value followed by return to suppression.\" The current pattern shows three consecutive measurements above the suppression threshold over an $8$-week period (from week $4$ to $12$). This is not a \"single\" value, and there has been no \"return to suppression.\" Therefore, this cannot be classified as an isolated blip.\n    -   The definition for \"persistent viremia\" is \"repeated measures\" of detectable virus. The sequence $320$, $260$, $170$ copies/mL constitutes repeated measures of viremia above the suppression threshold. This pattern is best described as **persistent low-level viremia (LLV)**. Persistent LLV (typically defined as confirmed RNA levels between $50$ and $1000$ copies/mL) indicates that the ART regimen is not fully effective and is a risk factor for the selection of drug-resistance mutations and subsequent virologic failure. Therefore, the situation represents **evolving virologic failure**.\n\n2.  **Determination of the Next Diagnostic Step:**\n    Given the classification of persistent LLV/evolving virologic failure, the clinical objectives are to identify the cause and gather information to guide future treatment.\n    -   **Investigate Causes:** The most common causes of virologic failure in a previously stable patient are suboptimal adherence and drug-drug interactions (DDIs). The problem states the patient reports no missed doses but has started new medications. This makes the investigation of DDIs a high priority. Certain INSTIs are susceptible to interactions, for example, with polyvalent cations found in antacids and supplements, which can chelate the drug and reduce its absorption. A thorough review of all medications is essential. Adherence should also be reassessed in detail.\n    -   **Confirm and Trend Viremia:** Before making major changes, it is standard practice to confirm that viremia is indeed persistent. Repeating the HIV-1 RNA test in a short interval (e.g., $2$–$4$ weeks) is indicated.\n    -   **Assess for Drug Resistance:** It is critical to determine if the virus has developed resistance to the current regimen. The standard test for this is **plasma HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing**. This test should be performed while the patient is still taking the failing regimen to ensure that the resistant viral variants are under selective pressure and thus more likely to be detected. However, as noted in the problem, these assays have minimum viral load requirements, typically $200$-$500$ copies/mL. With recent values of $320$ and $260$ copies/mL, the test might be successful, but at $170$ copies/mL, it might fail. Therefore, it is appropriate to \"attempt\" it.\n    -   **Contingency for Low Viral Load:** If the plasma RNA level is too low for standard genotyping, **proviral DNA genotyping** is an alternative. This method analyzes the viral DNA integrated into the host's cells and can detect resistance mutations even when plasma viremia is low or undetectable.\n\nCombining these steps, the optimal management strategy is to classify the condition as persistent LLV indicating evolving failure, investigate adherence and DDIs, repeat the RNA measurement in $2$–$4$ weeks to confirm persistence, and attempt plasma genotype testing, with a plan to use proviral DNA genotyping if needed.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Classify as an isolated virologic blip; proceed with routine monitoring at $3$–$6$-month intervals without additional evaluation.**\n-   This option incorrectly classifies the virologic pattern. The data shows three consecutive viral load measurements $> 50$ copies/mL, which is by definition persistent and not an isolated blip. The proposed action of infrequent monitoring without further workup is clinically inappropriate and risks progression to high-level failure with extensive drug resistance.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Classify as persistent low-level viremia indicating evolving virologic failure; urgently assess adherence and drug–drug interactions and attempt plasma HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing while the patient remains on the current regimen; if genotyping is unsuccessful at low RNA levels, consider proviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) genotyping; repeat HIV-1 RNA in $2$–$4$ weeks to confirm persistence.**\n-   This option correctly classifies the pattern as persistent low-level viremia suggesting evolving virologic failure. It outlines a comprehensive and correct management plan that aligns perfectly with current clinical guidelines: investigate reversible causes (adherence, DDIs), attempt the standard-of-care resistance test (genotype) while acknowledging its limitations, propose the correct alternative (proviral DNA genotype), and include confirmatory RNA testing.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. Classify as assay variability; repeat the same test in $12$ months without interim evaluation.**\n-   This option incorrectly attributes a sustained, significant rise in viral load to mere assay variability. While PCR assays have inherent variability, a pattern of consistently detectable viremia well above the suppression threshold reflects a true biological phenomenon. The proposed action of waiting $12$ months is dangerous and deviates significantly from the standard of care.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Classify as acute intercurrent illness causing transient viremia; defer HIV-specific diagnostics and immediately switch ART empirically without resistance testing.**\n-   This option makes an assumption (\"acute intercurrent illness\") that is explicitly contradicted by the problem statement (\"There are no intercurrent acute infections reported\"). Furthermore, switching ART empirically without resistance data is a major clinical error, as it may lead to the selection of a new regimen to which the virus is also resistant.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Classify as persistent low-level viremia; obtain HIV-1 phenotypic resistance testing immediately, as it is accurate at $200$ copies per milliliter.**\n-   While the classification is correct, the proposed action is flawed. First, genotypic testing, not phenotypic testing, is the standard initial resistance assay for treatment failure. Second, the claim that phenotypic testing is accurate at $ 200$ copies/mL is factually incorrect for standard commercial platforms, which typically have viral load requirements similar to or higher than those for genotyping.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4910339"}, {"introduction": "After identifying persistent viremia, the next logical step is to order resistance testing to guide the selection of a new regimen.

This task hones your ability to translate a list of mutations into a qualitative prediction of drug efficacy, a foundational skill in constructing salvage therapy.", "problem": "A $48$-year-old individual with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) type $1$ infection has virologic failure on a protease inhibitor (PI)-containing regimen. Genotypic resistance testing identifies HIV protease substitutions at codons I54M, V82A, and L90M. You are asked to select between lopinavir/ritonavir and darunavir/ritonavir for the next regimen and to estimate which PI is more likely to retain activity, with justification grounded in first principles.\n\nUse the following fundamental base and well-tested facts to reason:\n\n- HIV protease is essential for maturation of infectious virions; protease inhibitors (PIs) bind the active site to prevent cleavage of Gag-Pol polyproteins. Resistance mutations alter binding site geometry and reduce inhibitor affinity.\n- The protein-binding adjusted $50\\%$ inhibitory concentration ($IC_{50}$) is the drug concentration at which viral replication is reduced by $50\\%$ in vitro under protein-binding conditions. Resistance increases the mutant $IC_{50}$ relative to wild-type (WT) by a phenotypic fold-change $FC$, such that\n$$IC_{50}^{\\text{mut}} = FC \\cdot IC_{50}^{\\text{WT}}.$$\n- The inhibitory quotient (IQ) is defined as\n$$IQ = \\frac{C_{\\min}}{IC_{50}},$$\nwhere $C_{\\min}$ is the trough plasma concentration at steady state with ritonavir boosting. For two PIs with similar $C_{\\min}$ and $IC_{50}^{\\text{WT}}$, the relative activity under resistance is driven by the $FC$; larger $FC$ lowers $IQ$ and thus clinical activity.\n- Lopinavir resistance is commonly associated with V82A, I54V/M, and L90M, among others, which synergistically increase $FC$ for lopinavir. Darunavir has a high genetic barrier; selected darunavir resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) include I50V, I54L/M, V32I, I47V/A, L33F, L76V, T74P, and I84V. Single RAMs typically confer modest $FC$ for darunavir, while multiple RAMs are needed for high-level resistance.\n\nAssume no pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions or adherence issues and comparable ritonavir boosting. Which option best estimates the likely relative activity and provides the most accurate justification?\n\nA. Lopinavir/ritonavir is more likely to retain activity than darunavir/ritonavir because I54M preferentially reduces darunavir binding while V82A and L90M minimally affect lopinavir; thus $FC_{\\text{DRV}}  FC_{\\text{LPV}}$ and $IQ_{\\text{DRV}}  IQ_{\\text{LPV}}$.\n\nB. Darunavir/ritonavir is more likely to retain activity than lopinavir/ritonavir because only I54M among the listed substitutions is a well-described darunavir resistance-associated mutation, whereas V82A, I54M, and L90M together substantially increase $FC$ for lopinavir; therefore $FC_{\\text{DRV}}  FC_{\\text{LPV}}$ and $IQ_{\\text{DRV}}  IQ_{\\text{LPV}}$.\n\nC. Both PIs have comparable activity because ritonavir boosting increases $C_{\\min}$ sufficiently to offset any increase in $IC_{50}$ from resistance mutations, keeping $IQ$ unchanged despite $FC$.\n\nD.

HIV protease is essential for viral maturation. PIs inhibit this enzyme. Resistance mutations alter the active site and reduce inhibitor affinity.\n    2.  The protein-binding adjusted $50\\%$ inhibitory concentration, $IC_{50}$, is the drug concentration for $50\\%$ viral inhibition.\n    3.  Resistance is quantified by the phenotypic fold-change, $FC$, where the mutant $IC_{50}$ is given by $$IC_{50}^{\\text{mut}} = FC \\cdot IC_{50}^{\\text{WT}}.$$\n    4.  The inhibitory quotient, $IQ$, is defined as $$IQ = \\frac{C_{\\min}}{IC_{50}},$$ where $C_{\\min}$ is the trough plasma concentration.\n    5.  For PIs with similar $C_{\\min}$ and $IC_{50}^{\\text{WT}}$, relative activity is inversely related to $FC$. A higher $FC$ leads to a lower $IQ$.\n    6.  **Lopinavir (LPV) Resistance Profile:** Resistance is commonly associated with mutations V82A, I54V/M, and L90M, which act synergistically to increase $FC_{\\text{LPV}}$.\n    7.  **Darunavir (DRV) Resistance Profile:** DRV has a high genetic barrier. DRV resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) include I50V, I54L/M, V32I, I47V/A, L33F, L76V, T74P, and I84V. Single RAMs typically confer modest $FC_{\\text{DRV}}$, and multiple RAMs are required for high-level resistance.\n- **Assumptions:** No pharmacokinetic interactions, no adherence issues, and comparable ritonavir boosting effects.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is assessed for scientific validity, coherence, and objectivity.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly based on established principles of HIV virology, pharmacology, and clinical medicine. The concepts of protease inhibitors, resistance mutations, $IC_{50}$, fold-change ($FC$), and inhibitory quotient ($IQ$) are standard and accurately defined. The specific mutations (I54M, V82A, L90M) and their general associations with lopinavir and darunavir resistance are consistent with extensive clinical and laboratory data (e.g., as compiled in the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database). The underlying biological and pharmacological principles are correct.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear clinical scenario, specific data (mutations), a set of simplifying assumptions, and a well-defined question. It asks for a comparative analysis of two drugs based on a logical framework provided within the problem itself. A unique, meaningful conclusion can be derived by applying the given principles to the data.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, technical, and free of bias or subjective claims. The problem presents factual information about drug resistance profiles and asks for a deduction based on these facts.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. The setup is a realistic, formalizable clinical reasoning task.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived based on the provided principles.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe primary objective is to determine which protease inhibitor, lopinavir (LPV) or darunavir (DRV), is more likely to retain clinical activity against an HIV-1 strain with protease mutations I54M, V82A, and L90M.\n\n1.  **Framework for Comparison:** The problem states that clinical activity can be estimated by the inhibitory quotient, $IQ = \\frac{C_{\\min}}{IC_{50}}$. A higher $IQ$ correlates with better antiviral activity. We are to assume that ritonavir boosting provides comparable trough concentrations ($C_{\\min}$) for both drugs. The comparison of activities thus reduces to a comparison of their respective $IC_{50}$ values against the mutant virus.\n    $$IQ_{\\text{LPV}} \\text{ vs. } IQ_{\\text{DRV}} \\implies \\frac{C_{\\min}}{IC_{50}^{\\text{mut, LPV}}} \\text{ vs. } \\frac{C_{\\min}}{IC_{50}^{\\text{mut, DRV}}}$$\n    Since $C_{\\min}$ is assumed similar for both, the drug with the lower $IC_{50}^{\\text{mut}}$ will have the higher $IQ$.\n\n2.  **Role of Fold-Change ($FC$):** The mutant $IC_{50}$ is defined as $IC_{50}^{\\text{mut}} = FC \\cdot IC_{50}^{\\text{WT}}$. Assuming the wild-type inhibitory concentrations ($IC_{50}^{\\text{WT}}$) are of a similar order of magnitude (a reasonable baseline assumption for potent PIs), the comparison of $IC_{50}^{\\text{mut}}$ values is dominated by the comparison of the fold-change values, $FC$.\n    $$IC_{50}^{\\text{mut, LPV}}  IC_{50}^{\\text{mut, DRV}} \\iff FC_{\\text{LPV}}  FC_{\\text{DRV}}$$\n    Therefore, the drug that is more likely to retain activity is the one for which the patient's viral mutations induce a smaller fold-change in $IC_{50}$. We must evaluate $FC_{\\text{LPV}}$ and $FC_{\\text{DRV}}$ based on the mutations I54M, V82A, and L90M.\n\n3.  **Analysis for Lopinavir (LPV):** The problem explicitly states that \"Lopinavir resistance is commonly associated with V82A, I54V/M, and L90M... which synergistically increase $FC$ for lopinavir.\" The patient's virus possesses all three of these key mutations (I54M, V82A, L90M). The term \"synergistically\" implies that their combined effect on resistance is greater than the sum of their individual effects. This leads to the conclusion that a substantial increase in fold-change for lopinavir is expected, i.e., $FC_{\\text{LPV}}$ will be large.\n\n4.  **Analysis for Darunavir (DRV):** The problem provides a list of DRV RAMs: I50V, I54L/M, V32I, I47V/A, L33F, L76V, T74P, and I84V. Comparing the patient's mutations (I54M, V82A, L90M) to this list, we find that only I54M is a listed DRV RAM. The mutations V82A and L90M are major resistance mutations for older PIs like lopinavir but are not on the list of key DRV RAMs. The problem further clarifies that \"Single RAMs typically confer modest $FC$ for darunavir, while multiple RAMs are needed for high-level resistance.\" Since the virus has only one DRV RAM, the expected fold-change for darunavir, $FC_{\\text{DRV}}$, should be modest.\n\n5.  **Comparative Conclusion:** We have deduced that $FC_{\\text{LPV}}$ is likely to be high due to the synergistic effect of three major LPV mutations, while $FC_{\\text{DRV}}$ is likely to be modest, resulting from a single DRV mutation. Therefore, it is highly probable that $FC_{\\text{DRV}}  FC_{\\text{LPV}}$.\n    From this inequality, it follows that $IC_{50}^{\\text{mut, DRV}}  IC_{50}^{\\text{mut, LPV}}$.\n    Consequently, the inhibitory quotient for darunavir will be higher than for lopinavir: $IQ_{\\text{DRV}}  IQ_{\\text{LPV}}$.\n    This indicates that darunavir/ritonavir is more likely to retain virologic activity compared to lopinavir/ritonavir in this patient.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Lopinavir/ritonavir is more likely to retain activity than darunavir/ritonavir because I54M preferentially reduces darunavir binding while V82A and L90M minimally affect lopinavir; thus $FC_{\\text{DRV}}  FC_{\\text{LPV}}$ and $IQ_{\\text{DRV}}  IQ_{\\text{LPV}}$.**\n- **Analysis:** This option makes two incorrect claims based on the problem statement. First, it states V82A and L90M \"minimally affect lopinavir,\" which directly contradicts the given fact that they are common LPV resistance mutations that act synergistically with I54M. Second, it concludes that LPV/r is more likely to retain activity ($IQ_{\\text{DRV}}  IQ_{\\text{LPV}}$), which is the opposite of our derivation.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Darunavir/ritonavir is more likely to retain activity than lopinavir/ritonavir because only I54M among the listed substitutions is a well-described darunavir resistance-associated mutation, whereas V82A, I54M, and L90M together substantially increase $FC$ for lopinavir; therefore $FC_{\\text{DRV}}  FC_{\\text{LPV}}$ and $IQ_{\\text{DRV}}  IQ_{\\text{LPV}}$.**\n- **Analysis:** This option's reasoning and conclusion are perfectly aligned with our derivation. It correctly identifies that DRV is affected by only one of the three mutations, while LPV is affected by all three synergistically. It correctly concludes that this leads to $FC_{\\text{DRV}}  FC_{\\text{LPV}}$ and therefore $IQ_{\\text{DRV}}  IQ_{\\text{LPV}}$, meaning DRV/r is more likely to be active. The entire statement is logically and factually consistent with the premises.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. Both PIs have comparable activity because ritonavir boosting increases $C_{\\min}$ sufficiently to offset any increase in $IC_{50}$ from resistance mutations, keeping $IQ$ unchanged despite $FC$.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement contains a fundamental flaw in reasoning. Ritonavir boosting increases the numerator ($C_{\\min}$) of the $IQ$ ratio. Resistance mutations increase the denominator ($IC_{50}$). The $IQ$ for the mutant virus will be $IQ_{\\text{mut}} = \\frac{C_{\\min}}{FC \\cdot IC_{50}^{\\text{WT}}}$. Since $FC  1$, the $IQ$ is necessarily reduced compared to the wild-type virus; it is not \"unchanged.\" Furthermore, this option incorrectly dismisses the differential impact of the mutations on the two drugs, which is the central point of the problem.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Neither PI retains clinically meaningful activity because the presence of three protease mutations implies class-wide resistance; thus $FC_{\\text{DRV}} \\approx FC_{\\text{LPV}} \\gg 1$ and $IQ \\to 0$ for both.**\n- **Analysis:** This option makes an oversimplified and likely incorrect assumption of broad class-wide resistance. Darunavir was specifically developed to have a high genetic barrier and to be active against viruses resistant to earlier PIs. The problem's premises strongly suggest a differential impact, with DRV being significantly less affected than LPV. The claim that $FC_{\\text{DRV}} \\approx FC_{\\text{LPV}}$ is contrary to the provided information. While high-level LPV resistance is predicted, it is not a given that DRV activity is completely lost.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4910160"}, {"introduction": "Ultimately, constructing a new regimen involves more than just interpreting a genotype; it requires synthesizing the patient's entire clinical picture.

According to principle (ii), the M184V mutation confers high-level resistance to 3TC. Therefore, 3TC cannot be considered a fully active agent in this patient.

While DTG has a high barrier to resistance, using it as functional monotherapy in a patient with pre-existing nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance significantly increases the risk of virologic failure and the development of resistance to integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). Pivotal clinical trials that established the efficacy of DTG/3TC (e.g., GEMINI 1  2) explicitly excluded patients with known resistance to any component of the study regimen.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option is contraindicated due to the high risk of treatment failure from functional monotherapy.\n\n**B. Switch to fixed-dose dolutegravir/rilpivirine dual therapy after confirming no rilpivirine resistance.**\n\n*   **Derivation:** This regimen consists of dolutegravir (DTG) and rilpivirine (RPV), available as a single-tablet regimen. This would meet the patient's goals of reducing pill count (from two to one) and avoiding tenofovir-related toxicity. The problem statement confirms no non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance, which is a prerequisite for using RPV. However, the patient takes omeprazole $20$ mg daily, a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). Rilpivirine absorption is highly pH-dependent and is significantly reduced in the presence of PPIs, which raise gastric pH. The co-administration of RPV and PPIs is pharmacokinetically contraindicated, as it can lead to subtherapeutic RPV levels, virologic failure, and the development of resistance to both DTG and RPV.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option is contraindicated due to a severe and clinically significant drug-drug interaction between rilpivirine and omeprazole.\n\n**C. Switch to fixed-dose bictegravir/tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine single-tablet regimen.**\n\n*   **Derivation:** This regimen consists of bictegravir (BIC), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), and emtricitabine (FTC), available as a single-tablet regimen (STR). This switch would achieve the patient's goal of reducing the pill count from two to one.\n    *   **Efficacy:** Bictegravir is a high-barrier INSTI, similar to DTG, and is fully active. Due to the M184V mutation, FTC is not a fully active agent. However, as stated in principle (ii), the M184V mutation increases viral susceptibility to tenofovir. Thus, TAF is not only active but hyper-active. The combination of a high-barrier INSTI (BIC) and an active NRTI (TAF) provides a robust regimen with two fully active components, consistent with principle (i). Maintaining the M184V-selected FTC also helps maintain the M184V mutation, which reduces viral fitness and enhances tenofovir activity. This is a standard and recommended approach for patients with isolated M184V.\n    *   **Toxicity  Interactions:** This option continues TAF, so it does not completely fulfill the goal of avoiding long-term tenofovir toxicity, although TAF is associated with less renal and bone toxicity than its predecessor, TDF. Bictegravir has a favorable drug-drug interaction profile and is not affected by omeprazole. It also does not have a clinically significant interaction with simvastatin that would require a change in management.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option simplifies the regimen to a single pill, maintains potent virologic suppression in the presence of M184V, and avoids any contraindicating drug-drug interactions. It is the most appropriate and safest strategy among the choices.\n\n**D. Switch to darunavir/cobicistat plus lamivudine dual therapy to avoid tenofovir exposure.**\n\n*   **Derivation:** This regimen consists of a boosted protease inhibitor (darunavir/cobicistat or DRV/c) and lamivudine (3TC). It would remove tenofovir, addressing one aspect of the patient's toxicity concerns.\n    *   **Efficacy  Pill Burden:** As with option A, this regimen includes 3TC, to which the patient's virus is resistant due to the M184V mutation. This would be functional monotherapy with boosted darunavir, violating principle (i). Furthermore, this is a two-pill regimen (e.g., Symtuza® plus a 3TC tablet, or Prezcobix® plus a 3TC tablet), which does not reduce the pill count from the patient's current two-pill regimen. It fails the simplification goal.\n    *   **Drug Interactions:** This option introduces a severe drug-drug interaction. Cobicistat is a strong inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme. Simvastatin is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4. Their co-administration is contraindicated because cobicistat would dramatically increase simvastatin levels, elevating the risk of severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. This risk is particularly concerning in a patient with a prior history of statin-associated myalgia.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option is inappropriate for three distinct reasons: it represents functional monotherapy, it involves a contraindicated and dangerous drug-drug interaction, and it fails to reduce the daily pill burden.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "4910257"}]}
