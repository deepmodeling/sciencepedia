Doxycycline $100$ milligrams (mg) by mouth once daily is selected as chemoprophylaxis. For suppressive prophylaxis with doxycycline, it is a well-tested and widely accepted clinical fact that dosing should begin $1$–$2$ days before first exposure and continue for $28$ days after the last possible exposure, because doxycycline does not eradicate tissue hypnozoites and protects by suppressing blood-stage parasitemia that can emerge from hepatic schizonts for several weeks after exposure.

The traveler will take exactly one tablet daily with perfect adherence, without interruptions, and there is no loading dose.\n\nThe unit price is $1.27$ United States dollars (USD) per $100$ mg tablet.

It is a formalizable problem directly relevant to the stated topic.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the total volume of Oral Rehydration Solution ($V_{\\text{ORS}}$) needed to replace the fluid deficit, and the total amount of sodium ($n_{\\text{Na}}$) delivered by this volume.\n\n**1) Calculation of the required ORS volume, $V_{\\text{ORS}}$**\n\nFirst, we calculate the mass of the fluid deficit, $m_{\\text{deficit}}$. The problem states this is a fraction $f$ of the total body mass $M$.\nGiven $M = 70\\,\\text{kg}$ and $f = 4\\% = 0.04$.\nThe fluid mass deficit is calculated as:\n$$m_{\\text{deficit}} = f \\times M$$\n$$m_{\\text{deficit}} = 0.04 \\times 70\\,\\text{kg} = 2.8\\,\\text{kg}$$\n\nThe problem requires replacing this fluid deficit with ORS. The volume of ORS is assumed to be equivalent to the volume of water needed to replace this mass deficit. The relationship between mass and volume is given by $m = \\rho V$, where $\\rho$ is the density of water. We are given $\\rho \\approx 1.0\\,\\text{kg/L}$.\nThe volume of ORS, $V_{\\text{ORS}}$, is therefore:\n$$V_{\\text{ORS}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{deficit}}}{\\rho}$$\n$$V_{\\text{ORS}} = \\frac{2.8\\,\\text{kg}}{1.0\\,\\text{kg/L}} = 2.8\\,\\text{L}$$\n\n**2) Calculation of the total sodium amount, $n_{\\text{Na}}$**\n\nNext, we calculate the total amount of sodium, $n_{\\text{Na}}$, contained in the calculated volume of ORS. The relationship between the amount of solute ($n$), concentration ($c$), and volume ($V$) is $n = c \\times V$.\nIn this case, the solute is sodium ($Na^+$), so we use the sodium concentration $c_{\\text{Na}} = 75\\,\\text{mmol/L}$ and the volume $V_{\\text{ORS}} = 2.8\\,\\text{L}$.\nThe total amount of sodium is:\n$$n_{\\text{Na}} = c_{\\text{Na}} \\times V_{\\text{ORS}}$$\n$$n_{\\text{Na}} = 75\\,\\frac{\\text{mmol}}{\\text{L}} \\times 2.8\\,\\text{L} = 210\\,\\text{mmol}$$\n\n**3) Final Answer Formatting**\n\nThe problem requires both quantities to be reported to four significant figures.\n-   The calculated volume is $V_{\\text{ORS}} = 2.8\\,\\text{L}$. To four significant figures, this is written as $2.800\\,\\text{L}$.\n-   The calculated sodium amount is $n_{\\text{Na}} = 210\\,\\text{mmol}$.

This exercise moves from prophylaxis and treatment to diagnosis, challenging you to think like a clinical epidemiologist. Using the foundational principles of Bayes' theorem, you will calculate how a diagnostic test result—in this case, a thick blood smear for malaria—alters the probability of disease. This practice is essential for developing sophisticated diagnostic reasoning, enabling you to interpret test results not in isolation, but within the context of a patient's pre-test probability to make evidence-based decisions about management.", "problem": "A group of returned travelers from sub-Saharan Africa presents to a tropical medicine clinic with acute undifferentiated fever.

Do not use a percent sign in your final answer.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical epidemiology and probability theory, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed in objective, precise language.\n\nThe solution will be derived from first principles. Let $M$ be the event that a traveler has malaria, and let $M^c$ be the complementary event that the traveler does not have malaria. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive thick blood smear result, and $T^-$ be the event of a negative result.\n\nFirst, we formalize the given information in probabilistic terms.\nThe pretest probability of malaria, or the prevalence in this population, is given as:\n$$P(M) = 0.12$$\nTherefore, the pretest probability of not having malaria is:\n$$P(M^c) = 1 - P(M) = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88$$\n\nThe sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive result given that the patient has malaria:\n$$\\text{Sensitivity} = P(T^+ | M) = 0.95$$\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of a negative result given that the patient does not have malaria:\n$$\\text{Specificity} = P(T^- | M^c) = 0.99$$\n\nFrom these definitions, we can derive two other conditional probabilities that are essential for our calculations.\nThe probability of a negative test given malaria (the false negative rate) is:\n$$P(T^- | M) = 1 - P(T^+ | M) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\nThe probability of a positive test given no malaria (the false positive rate) is:\n$$P(T^+ | M^c) = 1 - P(T^- | M^c) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$$\n\nNext, we derive the positive and negative likelihood ratios ($LR^+$ and $LR^-$).\nThe positive likelihood ratio is the ratio of the true positive rate to the false positive rate. It quantifies how much a positive test result increases the odds of having the disease.\n$$LR^+ = \\frac{P(T^+ | M)}{P(T^+ | M^c)} = \\frac{0.95}{0.01} = 95$$\nThe negative likelihood ratio is the ratio of the false negative rate to the true negative rate. It quantifies how much a negative test result decreases the odds of having the disease.\n$$LR^- = \\frac{P(T^- | M)}{P(T^- | M^c)} = \\frac{0.05}{0.99} \\approx 0.0505$$\n\nNow, we derive the posttest probabilities using Bayes’ theorem. Bayes’ theorem is stated as:\n$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$\nThe denominator $P(B)$ is the total probability of event $B$, which can be expanded using the law of total probability: $P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c)$.\n\nThe posttest probability of malaria given a positive result, $P(M|T^+)$, is also known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV).\n$$P(M|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|M)P(M)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$, is the sum of true positives and false positives:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|M)P(M) + P(T^+|M^c)P(M^c)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.95)(0.12) + (0.01)(0.88) = 0.114 + 0.0088 = 0.1228$$\nNow we can calculate the posttest probability:\n$$P(M|T^+) = \\frac{0.114}{0.1228} \\approx 0.92833876...$$\n\nThe posttest probability of malaria given a negative result, $P(M|T^-)$, is calculated similarly:\n$$P(M|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|M)P(M)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe total probability of a negative test, $P(T^-)$, is the sum of true negatives and false negatives:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^-|M^c)P(M^c) + P(T^-|M)P(M)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(T^-) = (0.99)(0.88) + (0.05)(0.12) = 0.8712 + 0.006 = 0.8772$$\nNow we can calculate the posttest probability of having malaria despite a negative test:\n$$P(M|T^-) = \\frac{0.006}{0.8772} \\approx 0.0068399...$$\n\nClinical Interpretation:\nThe pretest probability of malaria was $12\\%$. After a positive thick smear, the probability of malaria increases dramatically to approximately $92.8\\%$. This high posttest probability is a strong indication for immediate initiation of antimalarial therapy, as the risk of untreated malaria outweighs the risk of treating a false positive. Conversely, after a negative thick smear, the probability of malaria decreases to approximately $0.68\\%$. This very low probability provides strong evidence against malaria and allows the clinician to confidently search for other causes of fever and withhold antimalarial treatment, although repeat testing may be considered if clinical suspicion remains exceptionally high.\n\nThe specific value requested for the final answer is the posttest probability of malaria given the positive thick smear, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(M|T^+) \\approx 0.9283$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9283}$$", "id": "4909823"}]}
