A percentage reduction of $35\\%$ corresponds to a fractional reduction of $0.35$.\nLet the criterion for a meaningful response be $R_c$.\n$$R_c = 35\\% = 0.35$$\nThe condition for a meaningful response is that the observed fractional reduction $R$ must be greater than or equal to $R_c$:\n$$R \\ge R_c$$\n\nWe compare our calculated value of $R$ with $R_c$:\n$$0.400 \\ge 0.35$$\nThis inequality is true.
