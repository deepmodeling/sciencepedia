The values provided are clinically realistic for a patient with severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The BODE index is a well-established, formal prognostic tool in pulmonology. Therefore, the problem is valid and a definitive solution can be derived.\n\nThe task is to compute the BODE index for the given patient. The BODE index is a multidimensional scoring system used to predict mortality risk in patients with COPD. The acronym BODE stands for its four components: Body mass index, airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea, and Exercise capacity. The total score is the sum of the points from each of these four components, with a maximum possible score of $10$.\n\n1.  **Body Mass Index (B)**\n    The patient's Body Mass Index (BMI) is given as $20.8 \\, \\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}$. The scoring for the BMI component is as follows:\n    -   BMI $ 21$ $\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}$: $0$ points\n    -   BMI $\\le 21$ $\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}$: $1$ point\n\n    Since the patient's BMI is $20.8$, which is $\\le 21$, the score for this component is $1$.\n\n2.  **Airflow Obstruction (O)**\n    This component is based on the post-bronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV$_1$), expressed as a percentage of the predicted value.\n    The patient's actual FEV$_1$ is $0.91$ $\\text{L}$.\n    The predicted FEV$_1$ is $2.80$ $\\text{L}$.\n    The FEV$_1$ percent predicted is calculated as:\n    $$ \\text{FEV}_1 \\% \\text{ predicted} = \\frac{\\text{Actual FEV}_1}{\\text{Predicted FEV}_1} \\times 100 = \\frac{0.91}{2.80} \\times 100 = 32.5\\% $$\n    The scoring for the airflow obstruction component is based on this percentage:\n    -   FEV$_1 \\ge 65\\%$ of predicted: $0$ points\n    -   FEV$_1$ $50\\%-64\\%$ of predicted: $1$ point\n    -   FEV$_1$ $36\\%-49\\%$ of predicted: $2$ points\n    -   FEV$_1 \\le 35\\%$ of predicted: $3$ points\n\n    The patient's FEV$_1$ is $32.5\\%$ of predicted, which falls into the $\\le 35\\%$ category. Therefore, the score for this component is $3$.\n\n3.  **Dyspnea (D)**\n    This component is evaluated using the Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale. The patient's dyspnea is graded as mMRC grade $3$. The scoring for this component is:\n    -   mMRC grade $0-1$: $0$ points\n    -   mMRC grade $2$: $1$ point\n    -   mMRC grade $3$: $2$ points\n    -   mMRC grade $4$: $3$ points\n\n    The patient has an mMRC grade of $3$. Therefore, the score for this component is $2$.\n\n4.  **Exercise Capacity (E)**\n    This component is measured by the distance walked in the $6$-minute walk test (6MWT). The patient's 6MWT distance is $185$ $\\text{m}$. The scoring for this component is:\n    -   6MWT distance $\\ge 350$ $\\text{m}$: $0$ points\n    -   6MWT distance $250-349$ $\\text{m}$: $1$ point\n    -   6MWT distance $150-249$ $\\text{m}$: $2$ points\n    -   6MWT distance $\\le 149$ $\\text{m}$: $3$ points\n\n    The patient's distance of $185$ $\\text{m}$ falls within the $150-249$ $\\text{m}$ range. Therefore, the score for this component is $2$.\n\n**Total BODE Index Score**\nThe total BODE index is the sum of the points from each of the four components:\n$$ \\text{BODE Index} = \\text{Score(B)} + \\text{Score(O)} + \\text{Score(D)} + \\text{Score(E)} $$\n$$ \\text{BODE Index} = 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 8 $$\nThe patient's BODE index is $8$. A score in the range of $7-10$ categorizes the patient into the highest-risk quartile, associated with significantly increased mortality.\n\n**Clinical Interpretation for Lung Transplantation**\nAlthough the final answer requires only the numerical BODE index, the problem asks for a determination of the urgency of lung transplantation referral versus listing.\n-   **Referral:** According to established guidelines, referral for transplant evaluation is recommended for COPD patients with a BODE index of $5$ or greater. This patient, with a score of $8$, unequivocally meets the criteria for referral.\n-   **Listing:** A BODE index of $7-10$ is a strong indicator for considering active listing for transplantation. More importantly, the patient's history includes an exacerbation requiring noninvasive ventilation for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, with a PaCO$_2$ of $55$ $\\text{mmHg}$. This specific event (PaCO$_2  50$ $\\text{mmHg}$) is a key, independent criterion that signals a very high short-term mortality risk and is a strong indication for moving from referral to active listing. Therefore, based on the combination of a high BODE score and the history of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, this patient warrants urgent evaluation for active listing for lung transplantation, assuming no other contraindications.\n\nThe final numerical answer is the calculated BODE index score.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{8}\n$$", "id": "4864715"}, {"introduction": "A critical step in the lung transplant evaluation is assessing the function of the right heart, as chronic lung disease frequently leads to secondary pulmonary hypertension. This exercise demonstrates how to translate raw hemodynamic data from a right heart catheterization into a key physiological parameter, the pulmonary vascular resistance ($PVR$).

This relationship is expressed by the equation:\n$$R = \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q}$$\n\nIn the context of the pulmonary circulation, this resistance is termed the pulmonary vascular resistance ($PVR$). The pressure drop across the pulmonary circuit is the transpulmonary gradient, which is the difference between the mean pulmonary artery pressure ($mPAP$) and the pressure in the left atrium. The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ($PCWP$) is used as a standard clinical surrogate for left atrial pressure. The flow through the pulmonary circuit is the cardiac output ($CO$).\n\nTherefore, the formula for $PVR$ is:\n$$PVR = \\frac{mPAP - PCWP}{CO}$$\n\nThe problem provides the following hemodynamic data obtained from a right heart catheterization:\n-   Mean pulmonary artery pressure, $mPAP = 52\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n-   Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, $PCWP = 11\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n-   Cardiac output, $CO = 3.9\\,\\mathrm{L}\\cdot \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $PVR$:\n$$PVR = \\frac{52\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} - 11\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}}{3.9\\,\\mathrm{L}\\cdot \\mathrm{min}^{-1}}$$\n$$PVR = \\frac{41\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}}{3.9\\,\\mathrm{L}\\cdot \\mathrm{min}^{-1}}$$\n$$PVR \\approx 10.51282\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}\\cdot \\mathrm{min}\\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\n\nThe unit $\\mathrm{mmHg}\\cdot \\mathrm{min}\\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ is defined as a Wood unit. Rounding the result to four significant figures as requested yields:\n$$PVR = 10.51\\,\\text{Wood units}$$\n\nThe second part of the problem requires a determination of the appropriate type of transplantation based on this hemodynamic profile. A normal $PVR$ is typically less than $3$ Wood units. The calculated $PVR$ of $10.51$ Wood units indicates severe pulmonary hypertension. The hemodynamic definition of pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension is a $mPAP \\ge 25\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, a $PVR  3$ Wood units, and a $PCWP \\le 15\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$. The patient's values ($mPAP=52$, $PVR=10.51$, $PCWP=11$) clearly meet this definition.\n\nIn a patient undergoing isolated bilateral lung transplantation, the new, healthy lungs present a low-resistance circuit to the native right ventricle ($RV$). However, a chronically failing $RV$, as evidenced in this case by its dilation and moderately reduced systolic function on echocardiography as well as clinical signs of right heart failure (syncope on exertion, lower-extremity edema), may not be able to tolerate the acute hemodynamic shifts and potential reperfusion injury following transplantation. A severely elevated $PVR$, particularly when associated with established $RV$ dysfunction, is a major risk factor for acute, irreversible right-sided heart failure and death immediately following isolated lung transplantation. While various centers have different absolute cutoffs, a $PVR$ of this magnitude combined with objective evidence of $RV$ failure is often considered a contraindication to isolated lung transplantation.\n\nTherefore, the biologically appropriate surgical option is a combined heart–lung transplantation. This procedure replaces both the diseased lungs and the failing heart, thereby addressing both the primary pathology (fibrotic lung disease with secondary severe pulmonary hypertension) and its critical sequela (irreversible right ventricular failure).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10.51}$$", "id": "4864708"}, {"introduction": "Effective post-transplant care hinges on meticulous management of immunosuppressive medications to prevent rejection while minimizing toxicity.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe fundamental principle of linear pharmacokinetics at steady state is that the area-under-the-curve over a single dosing interval, $\\text{AUC}_{\\tau}$, is determined by the fraction of the dose that reaches the systemic circulation, $F \\times D$, and the systemic clearance, $CL$. The relation is given by:\n$$\n\\text{AUC}_{\\tau} = \\frac{F \\times D}{CL}\n$$\nThis equation is a direct consequence of the definition of clearance, where the total amount of drug eliminated over a dosing interval at steady state ($CL \\times \\text{AUC}_{\\tau}$) must equal the amount of drug absorbed from that dose ($F \\times D$).\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the *daily* AUC. Since the patient receives $2$ doses per day, we assume two equal dosing intervals. The total daily AUC is the sum of the AUCs from each dose. At steady state, the AUC over each dosing interval is identical. Therefore, the daily AUC is $2$ times the AUC for a single dosing interval.\n$$\n\\text{daily AUC} = 2 \\times \\text{AUC}_{\\tau} = 2 \\times \\frac{F D}{CL}\n$$\nWe apply this general formula to both the baseline and new conditions.\n\nFor the baseline conditions (subscript $0$):\n$$\n\\text{daily AUC}_{0} = 2 \\times \\frac{F_{0} D_{0}}{CL_{0}}\n$$\nFor the new conditions (subscript $1$), the parameters are modified as follows:\n- The dose per administration is reduced by $25\\%$:\n$$\nD_{1} = D_{0} \\times (1 - 0.25) = 0.75 D_{0}\n$$\n- The oral bioavailability is reduced by $30\\%$:\n$$\nF_{1} = F_{0} \\times (1 - 0.30) = 0.70 F_{0}\n$$\n- The clearance is stated to be unchanged:\n$$\nCL_{1} = CL_{0}\n$$\nThe new daily AUC, $\\text{daily AUC}_{1}$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{daily AUC}_{1} = 2 \\times \\frac{F_{1} D_{1}}{CL_{1}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $D_{1}$, $F_{1}$, and $CL_{1}$ into this equation:\n$$\n\\text{daily AUC}_{1} = 2 \\times \\frac{(0.70 F_{0}) (0.75 D_{0})}{CL_{0}}\n$$\nWe are asked to compute the fold-change ratio of the new daily AUC to the baseline daily AUC.\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{daily AUC}_{1}}{\\text{daily AUC}_{0}} = \\frac{2 \\times \\frac{(0.70 F_{0}) (0.75 D_{0})}{CL_{0}}}{2 \\times \\frac{F_{0} D_{0}}{CL_{0}}}\n$$\nThe terms $2$, $F_{0}$, $D_{0}$, and $CL_{0}$ are common to both the numerator and the denominator and thus cancel out.
