The Medical Research Council (MRC) scale for muscle strength grades each tested muscle group from $0$ (no contraction) to $5$ (normal strength). The MRC sum score is defined as the sum of $12$ bilateral muscle group grades: shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, and wrist extension in the upper limbs; hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion in the lower limbs, tested on both sides. Intensive Care Unit–Acquired Weakness (ICU-AW) is diagnosed when the MRC sum score is $\\lt 48$, provided the patient is awake, can follow commands, and has no confounding factors such as deep sedation or focal neurological deficits.\n\nAssume the patient is awake, follows two-step commands, is pain-controlled, and has no focal neurological deficits.

It is scientifically grounded in the clinical practice of critical care medicine, using established tools like the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score. It is well-posed, providing all necessary data—the individual muscle group grades—and clear, objective definitions for Intensive Care Unit–Acquired Weakness (ICU-AW) and \"affected\" muscle groups. The problem is self-contained and allows for a unique, verifiable solution.\n\nThe problem requires two primary tasks: first, to interpret the diagnostic certainty for ICU-AW based on the MRC sum score, and second, to compute the proportion of affected muscle groups.\n\nFirst, we will calculate the MRC sum score and interpret the diagnosis. The MRC sum score is the sum of the grades from $12$ specified bilateral muscle groups. The patient's individual grades are provided as:\n- Left shoulder abduction: $4$\n- Right shoulder abduction: $4$\n- Left elbow flexion: $3$\n- Right elbow flexion: $4$\n- Left wrist extension: $4$\n- Right wrist extension: $5$\n- Left hip flexion: $3$\n- Right hip flexion: $3$\n- Left knee extension: $4$\n- Right knee extension: $4$\n- Left ankle dorsiflexion: $2$\n- Right ankle dorsiflexion: $3$\n\nThe MRC sum score, denoted as $S_{MRC}$, is the summation of these $12$ values:\n$$S_{MRC} = 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 3$$\n$$S_{MRC} = 43$$\nThe diagnostic criterion for ICU-AW is an MRC sum score less than $48$. Since the calculated score is $S_{MRC} = 43$, the condition $43  48$ is met.\nThe problem statement explicitly confirms that the patient is awake, follows commands, and has no confounding factors. These are the necessary prerequisites for a valid MRC score assessment. Therefore, under the stated examination conditions, the application of the diagnostic rule is direct. The diagnosis of ICU-Acquired Weakness is confirmed with a high degree of certainty based on the provided clinical definition and data.\n\nSecond, we will compute the proportion of affected muscle groups. An \"affected\" muscle group is defined as having an MRC grade $\\leq 4$. The total number of tested muscle groups is $N_{total} = 12$. We must identify and count the number of muscle groups, $N_{affected}$, that meet this criterion.\n\nReviewing the list of scores:\n- Left shoulder abduction: $4$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Right shoulder abduction: $4$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Left elbow flexion: $3$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Right elbow flexion: $4$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Left wrist extension: $4$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Right wrist extension: $5$ ($\\gt 4$, not affected)\n- Left hip flexion: $3$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Right hip flexion: $3$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Left knee extension: $4$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Right knee extension: $4$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Left ankle dorsiflexion: $2$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n- Right ankle dorsiflexion: $3$ ($\\leq 4$, affected)\n\nBy counting, we find that $11$ of the $12$ muscle groups have a score less than or equal to $4$. Thus, $N_{affected} = 11$.\n\nThe proportion of affected muscle groups, $P$, is the ratio of the number of affected groups to the total number of groups:\n$$P = \\frac{N_{affected}}{N_{total}} = \\frac{11}{12}$$\nTo express this as a decimal fraction, we perform the division:\n$$P = \\frac{11}{12} \\approx 0.916666...$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P \\approx 0.9167$$\nThe first significant figure is $9$, the second is $1$, the third is $6$, and the fourth is $6$. The fifth digit is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\nTherefore, the proportion of affected muscle groups, rounded to four significant figures, is $0.9167$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9167}$$", "id": "4887049"}, {"introduction": "Beyond diagnosis, a key clinical task is to prognosticate and stratify risk for individual patients.

This exercise challenges you to critically appraise evidence from a hypothetical clinical trial comparing two sedation strategies and their impact on delirium, a major precursor to PICS. Calculating and interpreting key epidemiological metrics like risk difference, relative risk, and the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) are essential skills for making evidence-based decisions that can directly reduce the incidence of PICS [@problem_id:4887042].", "problem": "An intensive care unit randomized controlled trial comparing two sedation strategies in mechanically ventilated adults reported that the incidence of acute delirium during the sedation period was $0.25$ in the dexmedetomidine arm and $0.40$ in the midazolam arm.

Using standard epidemiological definitions grounded in absolute risk, relative risk, and the reciprocal relationship between absolute risk reduction and number needed to treat, compute the risk difference favoring dexmedetomidine over midazolam, the relative risk of delirium under dexmedetomidine compared to midazolam, and the number needed to treat to prevent one delirium case.

It presents a standard epidemiological calculation based on plausible data from a clinical trial context. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $I_E$ denote the incidence of acute delirium in the intervention group (dexmedetomidine) and $I_C$ denote the incidence in the control group (midazolam). The problem provides the following values:\n$$I_E = 0.25$$\n$$I_C = 0.40$$\n\nThe first quantity to compute is the risk difference favoring dexmedetomidine over midazolam. Since the incidence is lower in the dexmedetomidine arm, this quantity is the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR). The ARR is calculated as the difference between the incidence in the control group and the incidence in the intervention group.\n$$ARR = I_C - I_E$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ARR = 0.40 - 0.25 = 0.15$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures, which gives $0.1500$.\n\nThe second quantity is the relative risk (RR), which is the ratio of the incidence in the intervention group to the incidence in the control group.\n$$RR = \\frac{I_E}{I_C}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.25}{0.40} = 0.625$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures, which gives $0.6250$.\n\nThe third quantity is the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), which is the number of patients who would need to be treated with the intervention (dexmedetomidine) instead of the control (midazolam) to prevent one additional adverse outcome (delirium case). The NNT is the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nUsing the calculated ARR:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.15} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{15}{100}} = \\frac{100}{15} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.666...$$\nAccording to the problem's instructions, the NNT must be rounded up to the next whole integer. Therefore:\n$$NNT = 7$$\n\nFinally, we briefly interpret these results in the context of Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS). The calculations demonstrate that using dexmedetomidine instead of midazolam for sedation is associated with a substantial reduction in the risk of acute delirium. The absolute risk is reduced by $15$ percentage points ($ARR = 0.1500$), and the relative risk is reduced by $37.5\\%$ (since $RR = 0.6250$, the relative risk reduction is $1 - 0.6250 = 0.3750$). The NNT of $7$ indicates that for every $7$ patients sedated with dexmedetomidine rather than midazolam, one case of delirium is prevented. Given that delirium is a well-established and significant risk factor for the development of the long-term cognitive, psychiatric, and functional impairments that constitute PICS, these findings imply that the choice of dexmedetomidine over midazolam is a clinically meaningful strategy to mitigate the downstream risk of PICS in mechanically ventilated adults.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.1500  0.6250  7\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4887042"}]}
