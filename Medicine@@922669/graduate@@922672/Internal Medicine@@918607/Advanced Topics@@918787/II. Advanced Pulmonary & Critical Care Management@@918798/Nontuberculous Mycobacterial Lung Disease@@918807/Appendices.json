We are given the pretest probability and the sensitivity and specificity of a single culture.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the events and probabilities based on the provided information.\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has true NTM-PD.\nLet $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have true NTM-PD.\nLet $T_1$ be the event that the first sputum culture is positive.\nLet $T_2$ be the event that the second sputum culture is positive.\nWe are interested in the event $E$, which represents two concordant positive results, i.e., $E = T_1 \\cap T_2$.\n\nThe givens can be stated in probabilistic terms as follows:\nThe pretest probability of disease is $P(D) = p$.\nTherefore, the pretest probability of no disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p$.\nThe sensitivity of a single culture is $Se = P(T_i | D)$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\nThe specificity of a single culture is $Sp = P(T_i^c | D^c)$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\nFrom the definition of specificity, the false-positive rate for a single culture is $P(T_i | D^c) = 1 - P(T_i^c | D^c) = 1 - Sp$.\n\nThe problem states that the two culture results are conditionally independent given the true disease state. This means:\n$P(T_1 \\cap T_2 | D) = P(T_1 | D) P(T_2 | D)$\n$P(T_1 \\cap T_2 | D^c) = P(T_1 | D^c) P(T_2 | D^c)$\n\nOur goal is to find the post-test probability of disease, which is the conditional probability $P(D | E)$, or $P(D | T_1 \\cap T_2)$.\n\nWe apply Bayes' theorem to calculate this posterior probability:\n$$P(D | E) = \\frac{P(E | D) P(D)}{P(E)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(E)$, is the total probability of observing two positive tests. It can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$P(E) = P(E | D) P(D) + P(E | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nSubstituting this into the Bayes' theorem formula gives:\n$$P(D | E) = \\frac{P(E | D) P(D)}{P(E | D) P(D) + P(E | D^c) P(D^c)}$$\n\nNow, we must calculate the conditional probabilities $P(E | D)$ and $P(E | D^c)$.\n$P(E | D)$ is the probability of observing two positive cultures given that the patient has the disease. Using the assumption of conditional independence:\n$$P(E | D) = P(T_1 \\cap T_2 | D) = P(T_1 | D) P(T_2 | D) = Se \\cdot Se = Se^2$$\n\nSimilarly, $P(E | D^c)$ is the probability of observing two positive cultures given that the patient does not have the disease. Using conditional independence again:\n$$P(E | D^c) = P(T_1 \\cap T_2 | D^c) = P(T_1 | D^c) P(T_2 | D^c) = (1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - Sp) = (1 - Sp)^2$$\n\nNow we substitute these expressions, along with $P(D) = p$ and $P(D^c) = 1 - p$, back into the full Bayes' theorem expression:\nThe numerator is $P(E | D) P(D) = Se^2 \\cdot p$.\nThe denominator is $P(E | D) P(D) + P(E | D^c) P(D^c) = Se^2 \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)^2 \\cdot (1 - p)$.\n\nCombining these gives the final expression for the post-test probability:\n$$P(D | E) = \\frac{p \\cdot Se^2}{p \\cdot Se^2 + (1 - p)(1 - Sp)^2}$$\n\nThis expression represents the probability of true disease given $2$ concordant positive test results, as a function of the pretest probability $p$, sensitivity $Se$, and specificity $Sp$.

The principle of dose proportionality is given by the linear relationship:\n$$D_{\\text{calc}} = m \\times d$$\n\nThe givens are:\n- Patient body mass, $m = 78\\,\\text{kg}$.\n- Recommended daily dose target, $d = 10\\,\\text{mg/kg}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$D_{\\text{calc}} = 78\\,\\text{kg} \\times 10\\,\\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} = 780\\,\\text{mg}$$\n\nThe problem also specifies a maximum recommended adult daily dose, $D_{\\text{max}}$, to mitigate the risk of toxicity, primarily hepatotoxicity.\n- Maximum recommended daily dose, $D_{\\text{max}} = 600\\,\\text{mg}$.\n\nTo ensure patient safety, the prescribed dose, $D_{\\text{prescribed}}$, must not exceed this ceiling. Therefore, the appropriate dose is the minimum of the calculated weight-based dose and the maximum recommended dose:\n$$D_{\\text{prescribed}} = \\min(D_{\\text{calc}}, D_{\\text{max}})$$\n$$D_{\\text{prescribed}} = \\min(780\\,\\text{mg}, 600\\,\\text{mg}) = 600\\,\\text{mg}$$\n\nThus, the calculated dose based on body weight exceeds the established safety limit. The correct daily dose to administer is the maximum recommended dose of $600\\,\\text{mg}$.\n\n**Part 2: Scientifically Justified Monitoring Plan**\n\nThe monitoring plan must address three key areas of risk: hepatotoxicity, subtherapeutic anticoagulation due to interaction with warfarin, and potential failure of antiretroviral therapy (ART) due to interaction with the HIV medication regimen. The plan is predicated on rifampin's well-characterized role as a potent inducer of hepatic metabolic enzymes and drug transporters.\n\n**A. Hepatotoxicity Surveillance**\n- **Scientific Rationale:** Rifampin is associated with a risk of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). The mechanism can be a direct toxic effect or an idiosyncratic reaction. The patient has a history of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which, despite normal baseline liver function, may confer an increased susceptibility to further hepatic insult.\n- **Monitoring Protocol:**\n    1.  **Baseline Assessment:** Before initiating rifampin, obtain baseline measurements of liver function tests (LFTs), including serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin. The problem states these are normal, which is a critical prerequisite.\n    2.  **Frequent Initial Monitoring:** Monitor LFTs frequently during the initial phase of therapy, when the risk of DILI is highest. A reasonable schedule is every $2$ to $4$ weeks for the first $2$ to $3$ months of treatment.\n    3.  **Long-Term Monitoring:** If LFTs remain stable, the monitoring frequency may be reduced for the remainder of the treatment course, but should not be discontinued entirely given the patient's underlying NAFLD.\n    4.  **Action Thresholds:** Establish clear criteria for intervention. For example, rifampin should be discontinued if AST/ALT levels rise to greater than $5$ times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in an asymptomatic patient, or greater than $3$ times the ULN in a patient with symptoms of hepatitis (e.g., nausea, fatigue, jaundice).\n\n**B. Warfarin and Anticoagulation Management**\n- **Scientific Rationale:** Warfarin is a racemic mixture, with the $S$-enantiomer being significantly more potent. The metabolism of S-warfarin is primarily mediated by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP2C9. Rifampin is a powerful inducer of CYP2C9. This induction leads to a marked increase in the metabolic clearance of warfarin, resulting in a lower plasma concentration and a subtherapeutic anticoagulant effect, manifested as a decrease in the International Normalized Ratio (INR). For a patient with atrial fibrillation, a subtherapeutic INR in the target range of $2$ to $3$ significantly elevates the risk of thromboembolic events, such as stroke. The induction effect has a latency of several days to a week as it requires de novo synthesis of enzyme protein.\n- **Monitoring Protocol:**\n    1.  **Baseline INR:** Confirm the patient's INR is within the therapeutic range ($2$ to $3$) immediately before starting rifampin.\n    2.  **Intensified INR Monitoring:** After initiating rifampin, begin frequent INR monitoring. An initial check should occur within $3$ to $5$ days, followed by checks every $2$ to $4$ days until the INR is stable within the therapeutic range on a new, higher warfarin dose.\n    3.  **Warfarin Dose Adjustment:** Anticipate a substantial increase in the required warfarin dose, potentially from $50\\%$ to over $100\\%$ of the pre-rifampin dose. Adjustments must be made based on frequent INR measurements.\n    4.  **Monitoring upon Discontinuation:** When rifampin is eventually stopped, the enzyme induction effect will dissipate over $1$ to $2$ weeks. The patient's warfarin metabolism will return to its baseline rate. Failure to proactively reduce the warfarin dose will lead to a supratherapeutic INR and a high risk of major hemorrhage. Therefore, upon discontinuation of rifampin, the warfarin dose must be reduced, and frequent INR monitoring must be reinstituted until a stable, lower dose is established.\n\n**C. Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Interactions**\n- **Scientific Rationale:** Rifampin induces not only CYP enzymes (most notably CYP3A4, a key metabolic pathway for many drugs) but also the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter. Many antiretroviral agents are substrates for either or both of these systems. The induction by rifampin accelerates their clearance, leading to subtherapeutic plasma concentrations. This compromises the efficacy of the ART regimen, creating a risk of virologic failure (i.e., a detectable HIV viral load), subsequent immunologic decline, and the selection of drug-resistant HIV variants.\n- **Management and Monitoring Protocol:**\n    1.  **Regimen Review and Modification:** The patient's current ART regimen must be critically evaluated for interactions. Co-administration of rifampin is contraindicated with most protease inhibitors (PIs) and cobicistat- or ritonavir-boosted regimens due to profound reductions in their concentrations. Significant interactions also occur with most non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs).\n    2.  **Choice of Rifamycin or ART:** The standard-of-care approach is typically to substitute rifampin with rifabutin, which is a less potent enzyme inducer and has more manageable interactions with ART. If rifampin use is unavoidable, the ART regimen must be changed to one that is compatible. For example, a regimen based on an INSTI like dolutegravir would require a dose increase (e.g., to $50\\,\\text{mg}$ twice daily). A regimen based on efavirenz (an NNRTI) might be possible, but requires careful consideration of genetics and local guidelines.\n    3.  **Virologic Monitoring:** After any change to the rifamycin or ART regimen, the patient's HIV viral load (HIV RNA) must be monitored closely to ensure continued virologic suppression. A viral load test should be performed approximately $4$ weeks after the initiation of the new combination therapy and then regularly thereafter as per HIV treatment guidelines. This confirms that the drug-drug interaction has been successfully managed and that the ART regimen remains effective.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{600}$$", "id": "4875971"}]}
