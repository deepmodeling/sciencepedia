It provides all necessary data (patient weight, insulin sensitivity interval) and a clearly defined, non-ambiguous algorithm (use of the geometric mean to find the TDD coefficient) to compute a single, unique numerical answer. The request for rounding is also specific.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, clinical language, free of subjective or biased claims.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, missing information, contradiction, or ambiguity. It is a formalizable and verifiable calculation based on a realistic clinical scenario.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to calculate the initial once-daily dose of insulin glargine. The protocol dictates a multi-step calculation.\n\nFirst, we must determine the specific per-kilogram coefficient for the Total Daily Dose (TDD) of insulin. The protocol specifies using the log-scale midpoint, which is equivalent to the geometric mean, of the given sensitivity interval.\nLet the interval be $[a, b]$, where $a = 0.10$ units/kg/day and $b = 0.20$ units/kg/day.\nThe geometric mean, $C$, is calculated as:\n$$ C = \\sqrt{a \\times b} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ C = \\sqrt{0.10 \\times 0.20} = \\sqrt{0.02} \\text{ units/kg/day} $$\n\nSecond, we calculate the Total Daily Dose (TDD) by multiplying this coefficient, $C$, by the patient's weight, $W$.\nThe patient's weight is given as $W = 56$ kg.\n$$ \\text{TDD} = C \\times W $$\n$$ \\text{TDD} = \\sqrt{0.02} \\times 56 \\text{ units/day} $$\n\nThird, we determine the dose of basal insulin. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth), and the protocol specifies a \"basal-only\" regimen. This means the patient will not receive prandial (mealtime) insulin. The entire calculated TDD is therefore administered as basal insulin. Insulin glargine is a long-acting basal insulin typically administered once daily.\n$$ \\text{Basal Dose} = \\text{TDD} = \\sqrt{0.02} \\times 56 \\text{ units} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round it to three significant figures as requested.\n$$ \\text{Basal Dose} \\approx (0.141421356...) \\times 56 $$\n$$ \\text{Basal Dose} \\approx 7.9195959... \\text{ units} $$\nRounding this value to three significant figures, we examine the fourth significant digit. The first three digits are $7$, $9$, and $1$. The fourth digit is $9$. Since $9 \\geq 5$, we round up the third digit.\n$$ \\text{Rounded Basal Dose} = 7.92 \\text{ units} $$\nThe dose is expressed in International Units (U), so the final dose to be ordered is $7.92$ U of insulin glargine.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.92}$$", "id": "4817514"}, {"introduction": "Transitioning a patient from a continuous intravenous insulin infusion to a subcutaneous regimen is a critical juncture in their hospital course.
