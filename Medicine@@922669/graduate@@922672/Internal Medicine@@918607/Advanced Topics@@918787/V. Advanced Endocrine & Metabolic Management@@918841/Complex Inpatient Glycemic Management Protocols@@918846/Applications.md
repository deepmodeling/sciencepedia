## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The principles of inpatient glycemic management, while grounded in fundamental physiology and pharmacology, find their true expression in their application across the diverse and complex landscape of hospital medicine. The transition from theoretical knowledge to clinical expertise requires the ability to adapt core strategies to specific patient populations, acute clinical scenarios, and the unique demands of interdisciplinary care. This chapter explores these applications, demonstrating how the foundational protocols for insulin administration, glucose monitoring, and risk mitigation are operationalized in real-world contexts, from the emergency department to the operating room and the quality improvement committee. By examining these applications, the clinician learns to move beyond rigid algorithms toward a more nuanced, patient-centered, and systems-aware practice.

### Foundational Clinical Decisions at the Point of Entry

The initial moments of a patient's hospitalization represent a critical juncture for establishing glycemic safety. Two decisions are paramount: the reconciliation of home medications and the establishment of appropriate, context-dependent glycemic targets.

Acutely ill patients with diabetes are often taking a complex array of oral and injectable non-insulin agents. The physiological stress of illness, coupled with potential hemodynamic instability, organ dysfunction, and altered nutritional intake, mandates a [systematic review](@entry_id:185941) and proactive holding of many of these medications. For instance, [metformin](@entry_id:154107) must be discontinued in the setting of tissue hypoxia, hemodynamic instability, or significant renal impairment (e.g., an estimated [glomerular filtration rate](@entry_id:164274) (eGFR) below $30 \text{ mL/min/1.73 m}^2$) due to the risk of [metformin](@entry_id:154107)-associated [lactic acidosis](@entry_id:149851). Similarly, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are held to mitigate the risk of euglycemic [diabetic ketoacidosis](@entry_id:155399) and volume depletion, especially in patients who are ill or fasting. Sulfonylureas, which stimulate insulin secretion regardless of glucose levels, pose a high risk of hypoglycemia in patients with poor oral intake or impaired renal clearance and are almost universally discontinued on admission for acute illness. Other agents, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, may be held due to gastrointestinal side effects, while thiazolidinediones are contraindicated in the setting of fluid overload or heart failure. This systematic "sick day" deprescribing is a foundational safety practice that prioritizes the avoidance of foreseeable harm and prepares the patient for more flexible, titratable inpatient insulin regimens [@problem_id:4817534].

Concurrently, the clinical team must define the target glucose range for the hospital stay. This decision is not uniform but is stratified based on the patient's clinical location and acuity. For the majority of critically ill patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), landmark clinical trials have demonstrated that intensive glucose control to near-normal levels (e.g., $80$–$110$ mg/dL) increases mortality, primarily due to a higher incidence of severe hypoglycemia. Therefore, the standard of care for most ICU patients is a more moderate target range of $140$–$180$ mg/dL. This range is a pragmatic compromise that avoids the most severe consequences of hyperglycemia (such as impaired immune function and osmotic diuresis) while providing a substantial safety buffer against hypoglycemia. In contrast, for non-critically ill patients on general medical and surgical wards who are eating regular meals, a lower target is often appropriate. A common goal is to maintain pre-meal glucose levels below $140$ mg/dL and random glucose levels below $180$ mg/dL. In certain highly-monitored, protocol-driven environments, even tighter targets may be justified; for example, some postoperative cardiac surgery patients may be targeted to $110$–$140$ mg/dL, and intrapartum management of gestational diabetes often aims for near-euglycemia to protect the neonate [@problem_id:4817540] [@problem_id:4445355].

### Managing Hyperglycemic Crises: DKA and HHS

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and the hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) are life-threatening metabolic emergencies that demand a rapid, systematic, and protocol-driven response. The management of these conditions is a sequential process that hinges on correcting pathophysiology in the correct order. The initial priority is never insulin, but rather the restoration of intravascular volume and the assessment and correction of electrolyte abnormalities. Patients are typically profoundly dehydrated due to osmotic diuresis, and aggressive resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids is the first step. This not only improves hemodynamic stability but also enhances renal perfusion, aiding the clearance of glucose and ketones.

The second, and perhaps most critical, pre-insulin step is the assessment of serum potassium. Although patients with DKA and HHS have a large total-body potassium deficit, initial serum levels can be normal or even elevated due to the extracellular shift of potassium in the setting of acidosis and insulin deficiency. Administering insulin, which drives potassium into the intracellular space, can precipitate life-threatening hypokalemia if initiated when serum potassium is low. Therefore, it is an absolute rule that insulin therapy must be withheld until the serum potassium is confirmed to be at a safe level (e.g., $\ge 3.3$ mEq/L). If the initial potassium is below this threshold, potassium repletion must begin immediately, and insulin must be deferred [@problem_id:4817519] [@problem_id:4817562].

Only after fluid resuscitation is underway and serum potassium is confirmed to be safe is it appropriate to initiate a continuous intravenous insulin infusion. In DKA, a weight-based infusion (e.g., $0.1$ units/kg/hr) is standard. In HHS, where patients are often exquisitely sensitive to insulin and at risk for [cerebral edema](@entry_id:171059) if osmolality is lowered too rapidly, an initial insulin bolus is generally avoided. Once the insulin infusion is active, the goal is a steady decline in blood glucose. When the glucose level falls to approximately $200$–$250$ mg/dL, dextrose must be added to the intravenous fluids. This crucial step allows the insulin infusion to be continued to suppress ketogenesis and resolve the metabolic acidosis (i.e., "close the anion gap") without causing hypoglycemia [@problem_id:4817519].

The resolution of DKA is defined not by the normalization of blood glucose but by the closure of the [anion gap](@entry_id:156621) and the resolution of acidosis (e.g., serum bicarbonate $\ge 15$–$18$ mEq/L). Once these biochemical criteria are met and the patient is clinically stable and able to eat, the transition from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin can be planned. This is another high-risk step. The very short half-life of intravenous insulin means that discontinuing the infusion without a bridge of subcutaneous insulin will result in a rapid return to a catabolic state and rebound ketosis. A safe transition requires administering a dose of long-acting (basal) subcutaneous insulin and allowing for a $1$- to $3$-hour overlap period before the intravenous insulin infusion is stopped. This ensures a continuous, therapeutic level of insulin is maintained throughout the transition [@problem_id:4817576].

### Glycemic Control in Special Populations and Contexts

Beyond the initial admission and the management of acute crises, inpatient teams are frequently confronted with the challenge of adapting glycemic protocols to patients with unique physiological states, nutritional regimens, and comorbidities.

#### Patients with Altered Nutritional Status

A patient's nutritional plan is a primary determinant of the insulin strategy. For a patient with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) who is made nil per os (NPO) for a procedure, withholding all insulin is a grave error that will inevitably lead to DKA. The correct approach is to provide a continuous source of basal insulin—typically a reduced dose of their home long-acting insulin—to suppress ketogenesis. Simultaneously, a continuous intravenous infusion of a dextrose-containing solution should be started. This "insulin-dextrose clamp" provides a safe, closed-loop system where a constant substrate is supplied to balance the action of the basal insulin, preventing both ketosis and hypoglycemia [@problem_id:4817530].

For patients receiving continuous enteral nutrition (tube feeds), the goal is to match the constant delivery of carbohydrates with a steady-state insulin effect. While an intravenous insulin infusion can achieve this, a more practical approach for stable, non-ICU patients is to use scheduled doses of a shorter-acting insulin. Given its pharmacokinetic profile, subcutaneous regular insulin administered every $6$ hours provides overlapping coverage that creates a relatively smooth, steady-state effect, mimicking the constant nutrient delivery. This strategy also aligns well with typical nursing workflows and provides a measure of safety, as a scheduled dose can be held if the feeds are interrupted [@problem_id:4817564].

Patients on total parenteral nutrition (PN) present a similar challenge. For unstable, critically ill patients, a continuous intravenous insulin infusion remains the gold standard, allowing for precise titration. However, for stable patients on long-term PN, a highly effective and safe strategy is to add regular human insulin directly to the PN bag. This ensures that insulin is co-administered with the dextrose load; if the PN infusion is stopped for any reason, the insulin delivery also ceases, dramatically reducing the risk of severe iatrogenic hypoglycemia. This strategy should always be paired with a contingency plan, such as a standing order to begin an infusion of $10\%$ dextrose if the PN is unexpectedly interrupted [@problem_id:5116915].

#### Patients with Comorbid Organ Dysfunction

Severe renal or hepatic dysfunction profoundly alters insulin metabolism and hypoglycemia risk. Both the kidneys and the liver are major sites of insulin clearance. In patients with severe chronic kidney disease (e.g., eGFR $ 30 \text{ mL/min/1.73 m}^2$) or decompensated cirrhosis, the clearance of exogenous insulin is dramatically reduced, prolonging its half-life and intensifying its effect. Furthermore, liver failure impairs endogenous glucose production via gluconeogenesis, removing a key physiological defense against falling blood sugar. This combination of prolonged insulin action and failed counter-regulation places these patients at exceptionally high risk for severe, prolonged, and often difficult-to-detect hypoglycemia. Management in this population must be conservative, involving significant empiric reductions (e.g., $25\%$ to $50\%$ or more) in basal and prandial insulin doses, the use of low-intensity correction scales, and intensified glucose monitoring, particularly overnight [@problem_id:4817588].

#### Patients on Glucocorticoid Therapy

Glucocorticoids are a common cause of inpatient hyperglycemia, inducing [insulin resistance](@entry_id:148310) through multiple mechanisms. The glycemic pattern produced by steroids is predictable and depends on the pharmacodynamics of the specific agent. An intermediate-acting steroid like prednisone, typically given in the morning, produces a characteristic pattern of relatively normal fasting glucose followed by progressively worsening hyperglycemia through the afternoon and evening. In contrast, a long-acting steroid like dexamethasone produces a more sustained plateau of [insulin resistance](@entry_id:148310) that persists overnight, often leading to significant hyperglycemia the next morning. Understanding these patterns is key to designing effective insulin regimens. For prednisone-induced hyperglycemia, a dose of intermediate-acting NPH insulin given in the late morning can be timed to match the peak insulin resistance in the afternoon [@problem_id:4817589].

### Interdisciplinary Frontiers: Perioperative and Obstetric Care

Effective glycemic management is often a profoundly interdisciplinary endeavor, nowhere more so than in the perioperative and obstetric settings.

#### The Perioperative Patient

The surgical patient with diabetes presents a complex challenge requiring close collaboration between medical, surgical, and anesthesia teams. A comprehensive preoperative optimization plan is essential. This includes a thorough medication reconciliation with timed discontinuation of high-risk agents. SGLT2 inhibitors must be stopped at least $3$ to $4$ days before major surgery to prevent euglycemic DKA. GLP-1 receptor agonists, which delay [gastric emptying](@entry_id:163659), should be held for a period appropriate to their dosing interval to reduce aspiration risk. Sulfonylureas are typically stopped $24$ hours prior to avoid intraoperative hypoglycemia. Metformin is held on the day of surgery due to the risk of [lactic acidosis](@entry_id:149851) in the setting of potential hemodynamic shifts or contrast dye exposure [@problem_id:4817548] [@problem_id:5169118].

A critical and often overlooked aspect of preoperative planning is the assessment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Patients on chronic glucocorticoid therapy (e.g., $\ge 5$ mg of prednisone daily for $3$ weeks) may have HPA axis suppression and will require intravenous "stress-dose" steroids to prevent perioperative hemodynamic collapse. For major surgery, the standard of care is an intravenous insulin infusion with a moderate glucose target of $140$–$180$ mg/dL, which provides the most effective and safest method of control in a dynamic environment marked by high levels of stress hormones and large fluid shifts [@problem_id:5169118].

#### The Obstetric Patient

Intrapartum glycemic management in patients with gestational diabetes (GDM) is a specialized field focused on a unique dual-patient dyad: mother and fetus. Maternal hyperglycemia leads to fetal hyperglycemia and subsequent fetal hyperinsulinemia. This, in turn, can cause a variety of neonatal complications, most acutely severe hypoglycemia after delivery when the maternal glucose supply is cut off. Therefore, the goal of intrapartum management is the maintenance of strict maternal euglycemia, with targets often as tight as $70$–$110$ mg/dL. While stable patients in early labor may be managed with subcutaneous correction insulin, the demonstration of significant glycemic [lability](@entry_id:155953) or the need for a prolonged induction in an NPO patient are clear indications to transition to a continuous intravenous insulin infusion paired with a dextrose infusion. This allows for the precise, minute-to-minute control required to protect the neonate [@problem_id:4445355].

### Systems-Level Integration and Modern Technology

Excellence in inpatient glycemic control extends beyond the care of a single patient to the systems and processes that ensure safety and efficacy on an institutional scale. Two modern challenges highlight this systems-level perspective: the management of patient-owned technology and the continuous improvement of hospital-wide protocols.

The increasing prevalence of patient-owned insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) presents a new frontier in hospital medicine. Allowing a patient to continue using their own device requires a robust institutional policy that balances patient autonomy with medication safety. Such a policy must include a structured competency assessment to ensure the patient is physically and cognitively capable of managing their device, a thorough inspection of the device and supplies, and a formal process for documenting all pump settings (basal rates, correction factors, insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios) in the electronic health record to serve as the official physician's order. Furthermore, the policy must define clear nursing roles for verification and oversight, mandate frequent point-of-care glucose testing for treatment decisions, and—most critically—specify the clinical conditions (e.g., altered mental status, ICU transfer, need for vasopressors) that mandate discontinuation of the pump, along with a pre-planned backup subcutaneous insulin regimen to ensure uninterrupted therapy [@problem_id:4817563].

Finally, no protocol is perfect. The science of quality improvement provides a framework for the [iterative optimization](@entry_id:178942) of hospital-wide glycemic management systems. Using methodologies like the Plan–Do–Study–Act (PDSA) cycle, multidisciplinary teams can test small, hypothesis-driven changes to their insulin protocols. The effects of these changes are best evaluated using tools from [statistical process control](@entry_id:186744), such as run charts and control charts, which allow teams to distinguish true signals of improvement (special-cause variation) from random noise (common-cause variation). By analyzing a primary outcome like time-in-range and a key balancing measure like the rate of hypoglycemia, institutions can systematically refine their protocols to achieve better and safer care for all patients [@problem_id:4817570].
