The variant is classified using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) framework with the following evidence codes: PS3 (strong functional evidence for a damaging effect), PM1 (moderate evidence of location in a mutational hot-spot or functional domain), PM2 (moderate evidence of absence in population controls, for example in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)), PP3 (supporting computational evidence of deleterious effect), and BS1 (strong benign evidence for allele frequency too high, but specifically negated for *SCN5A* in this disease context).\n\nAssume the clinic applies a Bayesian quantitative framework consistent with the Clinical Genome Resource Sequence Variant Interpretation (ClinGen SVI) recommendations, where each ACMG evidence strength is mapped to a likelihood ratio (LR).

It is scientifically grounded in the field of clinical genetics, specifically using the established ACMG/AMP framework for variant interpretation and a recognized Bayesian quantitative approach recommended by the ClinGen SVI. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data—a prior probability, a set of evidence codes with corresponding likelihood ratios, and an assumption of conditional independence—to calculate a unique and meaningful posterior probability. The terminology is precise and objective, and the scenario presented is a realistic representation of a common task in a clinical genetics laboratory.\n\nThe objective is to compute the posterior probability that the specified variant is pathogenic, given a set of evidence codes. This can be expressed as $P(\\text{Pathogenic} | \\text{Evidence})$. We will use Bayes' theorem, which is most conveniently applied in its odds form when dealing with likelihood ratios.\n\nLet $H_P$ be the hypothesis that the variant is pathogenic, and $H_B$ be the hypothesis that the variant is benign. The prior probability of pathogenicity is given as $P(H_P) = P_0 = 0.1$. The prior probability of the variant being benign is therefore $P(H_B) = 1 - P(H_P) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9$.\n\nThe prior odds in favor of pathogenicity are defined as the ratio of the prior probabilities:\n$$\nO_{prior} = \\frac{P(H_P)}{P(H_B)}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nO_{prior} = \\frac{0.1}{0.9} = \\frac{1}{9}\n$$\n\nThe evidence consists of five items, each with an associated likelihood ratio ($LR$). A likelihood ratio for a piece of evidence $E_i$ is given by $LR_i = \\frac{P(E_i | H_P)}{P(E_i | H_B)}$. The problem provides the following likelihood ratios for the given ACMG evidence codes:\n- $LR_{PS3} = 18.7$\n- $LR_{PM1} = 4.33$\n- $LR_{PM2} = 4.33$\n- $LR_{PP3} = 2.08$\n- $LR_{BS1} = 1$ (This code is negated, meaning it provides neutral evidence, which corresponds to an $LR$ of $1$.)\n\nThe problem states that these evidence items contribute independently, conditional on the pathogenicity status. Therefore, the total likelihood ratio for the combined set of evidence, $E = \\{E_{PS3}, E_{PM1}, E_{PM2}, E_{PP3}, E_{BS1}\\}$, is the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$\nLR_{total} = LR_{PS3} \\times LR_{PM1} \\times LR_{PM2} \\times LR_{PP3} \\times LR_{BS1}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nLR_{total} = 18.7 \\times 4.33 \\times 4.33 \\times 2.08 \\times 1\n$$\n$$\nLR_{total} = 18.7 \\times (4.33)^2 \\times 2.08\n$$\n$$\nLR_{total} = 18.7 \\times 18.7489 \\times 2.08\n$$\n$$\nLR_{total} = 729.256792\n$$\n\nAccording to the odds form of Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the total likelihood ratio:\n$$\nO_{posterior} = O_{prior} \\times LR_{total}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $O_{prior}$ and $LR_{total}$:\n$$\nO_{posterior} = \\frac{1}{9} \\times 729.256792 \\approx 81.0285324\n$$\n\nFinally, we convert the posterior odds back into a posterior probability. The posterior probability of pathogenicity, $P_{posterior} = P(H_P | E)$, is related to the posterior odds by the formula:\n$$\nP_{posterior} = \\frac{O_{posterior}}{1 + O_{posterior}}\n$$\nSubstituting the value of $O_{posterior}$:\n$$\nP_{posterior} = \\frac{81.0285324}{1 + 81.0285324} = \\frac{81.0285324}{82.0285324}\n$$\n$$\nP_{posterior} \\approx 0.9878090\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\nP_{posterior} \\approx 0.9878\n$$\nThis posterior probability places the variant in the \"Pathogenic\" classification category according to the ClinGen SVI framework, which sets a threshold of $P(\\text{Pathogenic} | \\text{Evidence}) \\ge 0.99$ for Pathogenic and $0.90 - 0.99$ for Likely Pathogenic. The calculated value of approximately $0.988$ falls into the \"Likely Pathogenic\" range. However, the exact thresholds can vary, and the calculation itself is the primary goal.

The expression should be in terms of $\\pi(a)$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed for validity.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics and established knowledge in medical genetics. The association of HCM with *MYH7* and *MYBPC3* genes, the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, and the concept of age-related penetrance are all scientifically sound and central to the field. The simplifying assumptions (no phenocopy, negligible de novo rate) are standard for isolating a specific genetic risk calculation and are explicitly stated.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined and structured. It provides all necessary information (parental genotypes, mode of inheritance, definition of penetrance) to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The question asks for a specific probability, which is computable from the givens.\n- **Objective:** The language is precise and unbiased. Terms like \"heterozygous,\" \"autosomal dominant,\" and \"age-related penetrance\" are standard and well-defined, leaving no room for subjective interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically sound query in quantitative medical genetics. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n***\n\nThe objective is to derive the probability that a child of the specified parents both inherits the pathogenic variant and manifests the associated phenotype (HCM) by a given age $a$.\n\nFirst, we define autosomal dominant inheritance with age-related penetrance in this context. Let $V$ represent the pathogenic variant allele and $v$ represent the normal (wild-type) allele.\nThe proband is affected and heterozygous, so their genotype is $Vv$. The other parent is unaffected and confirmed negative for the variant, so their genotype is $vv$.\n\nAccording to Mendelian principles of segregation, each parent transmits one of their two alleles to an offspring with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$. The possible genotypes for a child are determined by combining one allele from each parent:\n- The heterozygous parent ($Vv$) can transmit allele $V$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ or allele $v$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n- The homozygous parent ($vv$) can only transmit allele $v$ with probability $1$.\n\nThe probability of a child inheriting the pathogenic variant allele $V$ is the probability of the heterozygous parent transmitting $V$. Let $C$ be the event that the child is a carrier of the variant (genotype $Vv$).\n$$P(C) = P(\\text{parent } Vv \\text{ transmits } V) \\times P(\\text{parent } vv \\text{ transmits } v) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe probability of the child not inheriting the variant (genotype $vv$), denoted by the event $C^c$, is:\n$$P(C^c) = P(\\text{parent } Vv \\text{ transmits } v) \\times P(\\text{parent } vv \\text{ transmits } v) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nNext, we formalize the concept of age-related penetrance. Let $A_a$ be the event that an individual manifests the HCM phenotype by age $a$. The problem defines penetrance, $\\pi(a)$, as the probability that a carrier manifests the phenotype by age $a$. This is a conditional probability:\n$$P(A_a | C) = \\pi(a)$$\nThe problem also states that there is no phenocopy risk, meaning non-carriers do not develop the phenotype. This implies that the probability of manifesting the phenotype given non-carrier status is zero:\n$$P(A_a | C^c) = 0$$\n\nWe are asked to find the probability that a child both inherits the variant AND manifests the phenotype by age $a$. This corresponds to the joint probability of events $C$ and $A_a$, denoted $P(C \\cap A_a)$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, we can write:\n$$P(C \\cap A_a) = P(A_a | C) \\times P(C)$$\nWe have already established the values for both terms on the right-hand side of the equation:\n- $P(A_a | C) = \\pi(a)$ (the given penetrance function)\n- $P(C) = \\frac{1}{2}$ (the Mendelian probability of inheritance)\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the joint probability gives:\n$$P(C \\cap A_a) = \\pi(a) \\times \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThus, the probability that any given child of this couple will both inherit the familial pathogenic variant and manifest the HCM phenotype by age $a$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi(a)$.

A complete solution will now be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe Number Needed to Screen (NNS) is an epidemiological metric that quantifies the average number of individuals who must be screened to detect one ($1$) case of the disease or condition in question. It is mathematically defined as the reciprocal of the probability of a successful outcome (i.e., detection) for a single individual in the screened population.\n\nLet $P(\\text{ID})$ be the probability that a single, randomly chosen first-degree relative who is *approached* for testing is ultimately *identified* as a carrier of the pathogenic variant. The NNS is then calculated as:\n$$ \\text{NNS} = \\frac{1}{P(\\text{ID})} $$\n\nFor an approached relative to be identified as a carrier, two sequential and independent conditions must be met:\n$1$. The individual must have inherited the pathogenic variant. Let $C$ be the event that the relative is a carrier.\n$2$. The individual must agree to undergo genetic testing. Let $T$ be the event that the approached relative gets tested.\n\nThe problem provides the probabilities for these two events. Based on autosomal dominant inheritance from a heterozygous parent, the probability that a first-degree relative is a carrier is:\n$$ P(C) = 0.50 $$\n\nThe problem states that the test uptake fraction is $0.90$. This is the probability that an approached relative consents to testing:\n$$ P(T) = 0.90 $$\n\nThe event of identifying a carrier, $\\text{ID}$, is the logical AND of events $C$ and $T$. In probability theory, this corresponds to the intersection of the two events. Since the decision to get tested is independent of the individual's (unknown) carrier status, the probability of the intersection is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$ P(\\text{ID}) = P(C \\cap T) = P(C) \\times P(T) $$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into this expression:\n$$ P(\\text{ID}) = 0.50 \\times 0.90 = 0.45 $$\nThis result, $P(\\text{ID}) = 0.45$, is the yield of the screening strategy; it signifies that for every $100$ approached first-degree relatives, one can expect to identify $45$ carriers.\n\nNow, we can compute the NNS by taking the reciprocal of this probability:\n$$ \\text{NNS} = \\frac{1}{P(\\text{ID})} = \\frac{1}{0.45} $$\n\nTo express this as a fraction and then a decimal:\n$$ \\text{NNS} = \\frac{1}{45/100} = \\frac{100}{45} = \\frac{20 \\times 5}{9 \\times 5} = \\frac{20}{9} $$\n$$ \\text{NNS} = 2.222... $$\n\nThe problem specifies that the final answer must be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\text{NNS} \\approx 2.22 $$\n\nThus, one must screen, on average, $2.22$ first-degree relatives of the proband to identify one carrier of the pathogenic *PKP2* variant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.22}$$", "id": "4838955"}]}
