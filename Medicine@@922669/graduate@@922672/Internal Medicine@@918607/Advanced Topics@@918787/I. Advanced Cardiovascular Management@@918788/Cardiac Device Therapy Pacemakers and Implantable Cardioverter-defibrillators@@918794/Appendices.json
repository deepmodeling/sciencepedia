Computation of Atrial Sensitivity ($S_{\\text{A}}$)**\n\nThe atrial sensitivity threshold, $S_{\\text{A}}$, must be set to a value that satisfies two conditions:\n- It must be low enough to detect all intrinsic P-waves.\n- It must be high enough to reject all far-field R-waves (FFRW).\n\nFor reliable P-wave sensing, the sensitivity threshold must be less than the amplitude of the smallest possible P-wave.\n$$S_{\\text{A}}  A_{P,\\min}$$\nGiven $A_{P,\\min} = 1.60\\,\\text{mV}$, we have:\n$$S_{\\text{A}}  1.60\\,\\text{mV}$$\n\nFor reliable rejection of FFRW, the sensitivity threshold must be greater than the amplitude of the largest possible FFRW.\n$$S_{\\text{A}}  A_{R,\\max}$$\nGiven $A_{R,\\max} = 0.90\\,\\text{mV}$, we have:\n$$S_{\\text{A}}  0.90\\,\\text{mV}$$\n\nCombining these two inequalities defines the permissible range for $S_{\\text{A}}$:\n$$A_{R,\\max}  S_{\\text{A}}  A_{P,\\min}$$\n$$0.90\\,\\text{mV}  S_{\\text{A}}  1.60\\,\\text{mV}$$\n\nThe problem asks to choose an $S_{\\text{A}}$ that maximizes the sensing margin to both signal classes. The sensing margin for P-waves is $(A_{P,\\min} - S_{\\text{A}})$ and the margin for FFRW is $(S_{\\text{A}} - A_{R,\\max})$. To maximize the margin to both boundaries of the sensing window, we choose $S_{\\text{A}}$ to be the midpoint of the valid interval. This equalizes the two margins.\n$$S_{\\text{A}} = \\frac{A_{R,\\max} + A_{P,\\min}}{2}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$S_{\\text{A}} = \\frac{0.90\\,\\text{mV} + 1.60\\,\\text{mV}}{2} = \\frac{2.50\\,\\text{mV}}{2} = 1.25\\,\\text{mV}$$\nThis value of $S_{\\text{A}} = 1.25\\,\\text{mV}$ correctly falls within the allowed range $(0.90\\,\\text{mV}, 1.60\\,\\text{mV})$.

For entrainment: $T_{\\text{p}}  T_{\\text{tach}}$.\n2.  For maintaining capture: The paced stimulus must be delivered to excitable tissue.\n\nLet's analyze the second constraint in detail. A stimulus delivered at time $t_{stim}$ causes a local myocardial activation at time $t_{act} = t_{stim} + \\tau_{\\text{p}}$. This activation renders the tissue refractory for a duration $R_{\\text{p}}$. Therefore, the tissue remains refractory until time $t_{ref,end} = t_{act} + R_{\\text{p}} = t_{stim} + \\tau_{\\text{p}} + R_{\\text{p}}$.\n\nConsider a sequence of stimuli in an ATP burst.

Thus, we must have:\n$$T_{\\text{p}} \\ge \\tau_{\\text{p}} + R_{\\text{p}}$$\nThis inequality represents the lower bound for the pacing cycle length to ensure consistent capture.\n\nTo minimize $N$, we must minimize $T_{\\text{p}}$. The optimal pacing cycle length, $T_{\\text{p,opt}}$, is therefore the minimum allowed value:\n$$T_{\\text{p,opt}} = R_{\\text{p}} + \\tau_{\\text{p}}$$\nWe must verify that this optimal value is consistent with the entrainment condition, $T_{\\text{p,opt}}  T_{\\text{tach}}$. Substituting the expression for $T_{\\text{p,opt}}$:\n$$R_{\\text{p}} + \\tau_{\\text{p}}  T_{\\text{tach}}$$\nRearranging this gives:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{p}}  T_{\\text{tach}} - R_{\\text{p}}$$\nUsing the definition of the excitable gap, $G = T_{\\text{tach}} - R_{\\text{p}}$, the condition becomes:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{p}}  G$$\nThis condition is physically necessary; the pacing latency must be shorter than the excitable gap for pacing to be able to interrupt the circuit. We will verify this with the given numerical values.\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculation.\nFirst, calculate the tachycardia cycle length $T_{\\text{tach}}$:\n$$T_{\\text{tach}} = \\frac{L}{v} = \\frac{15 \\text{ cm}}{50 \\text{ cm/s}} = 0.3 \\text{ s}$$\nNext, check the condition $\\tau_{\\text{p}}  G$:\n$$G = T_{\\text{tach}} - R_{\\text{p}} = 0.3 \\text{ s} - 0.26 \\text{ s} = 0.04 \\text{ s}$$\nThe pacing latency is $\\tau_{\\text{p}} = 0.005$ s. Since $0.005 \\text{ s}  0.04 \\text{ s}$, the condition is met, and our derived optimal value is valid.\n\nNow, we calculate the optimal burst cycle length $T_{\\text{p,opt}}$:\n$$T_{\\text{p,opt}} = R_{\\text{p}} + \\tau_{\\text{p}} = 0.26 \\text{ s} + 0.005 \\text{ s} = 0.265 \\text{ s}$$\nFinally, we compute the required ratio $T_{\\text{p,opt}} / T_{\\text{tach}}$:\n$$\\frac{T_{\\text{p,opt}}}{T_{\\text{tach}}} = \\frac{0.265 \\text{ s}}{0.3 \\text{ s}} = \\frac{265}{300} = \\frac{53}{60}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $0.883333...$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe number is $0.883333...$. The first four significant figures are $8$, $8$, $3$, $3$. The fifth significant figure is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\nThe result is $0.8833$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8833}$$", "id": "4808146"}]}
