It is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid mechanics, specifically the analysis of thin-walled pressure vessels, a standard and appropriate model for this biomechanical context. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data (diameter, thickness, pressure), constants (conversion factor), and a clear objective. The language is objective and the given values are clinically realistic for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n\nThe fundamental principle for this derivation is static equilibrium. We consider a thin-walled cylinder of radius $r$, wall thickness $h$, and length $L$, subjected to a uniform internal (transmural) pressure $P$. To find the circumferential stress, often called hoop stress ($\\sigma_c$), we imagine cutting the cylinder in half along a diametral plane.\n\nThe force exerted by the internal pressure that tends to separate the two halves is the pressure $P$ acting on the projected internal area. This projected area is a rectangle with dimensions of the cylinder's diameter ($2r$) and its length ($L$).\nThe force due to pressure, $F_P$, is therefore:\n$$F_P = P \\times (2r \\times L)$$\n\nThis separating force must be balanced by the tensile forces within the material of the cylinder wall. The stress acts over the cross-sectional area of the wall that has been cut. This area consists of two rectangular sections, each with an area of wall thickness $h$ multiplied by the length $L$.\nThe total resisting area, $A_{wall}$, is:\n$$A_{wall} = 2 \\times (h \\times L)$$\n\nThe total resisting force, $F_{wall}$, is the product of the circumferential stress $\\sigma_c$ and this wall area:\n$$F_{wall} = \\sigma_c \\times A_{wall} = \\sigma_c \\times (2hL)$$\n\nFor the cylinder to be in static equilibrium, the pressure force must be equal to the resisting force in the wall:\n$$F_P = F_{wall}$$\n$$P(2rL) = \\sigma_c(2hL)$$\n\nWe can cancel the term $2L$ from both sides of the equation, yielding the fundamental relationship for hoop stress in a thin-walled cylinder:\n$$Pr = \\sigma_c h$$\nSolving for the circumferential stress, $\\sigma_c$, we obtain the required relationship, which is a form of the Law of Laplace:\n$$\\sigma_c = \\frac{Pr}{h}$$\nThis model is valid under the thin-wall assumption, which typically holds if the ratio of the radius to the wall thickness is greater than or equal to $10$.\n\nNow, we apply this formula using the provided clinical parameters after converting them to SI units.\nThe given parameters are:\nDiameter, $d = 6$ cm\nWall thickness, $h = 2$ mm\nMean Arterial Pressure, MAP $= P = 100$ mmHg\nThe conversion factor is $1$ mmHg $= 133.322$ Pa.\n\nFirst, we convert all quantities to SI base units (meters, Pascals):\nRadius, $r = \\frac{d}{2} = \\frac{6 \\text{ cm}}{2} = 3 \\text{ cm} = 3 \\times 10^{-2}$ m.\nWall thickness, $h = 2 \\text{ mm} = 2 \\times 10^{-3}$ m.\nPressure, $P = 100 \\text{ mmHg} \\times \\frac{133.322 \\text{ Pa}}{1 \\text{ mmHg}} = 13332.2$ Pa.\n\nBefore proceeding, we verify the thin-wall assumption:\n$$\\frac{r}{h} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}} = 15$$\nSince $15 \\ge 10$, the use of the thin-walled cylinder formula is justified.\n\nNext, we substitute these SI values into the derived equation for circumferential stress:\n$$\\sigma_c = \\frac{Pr}{h} = \\frac{(13332.2 \\text{ Pa}) \\times (3 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ m})}{2 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}}$$\n$$\\sigma_c = \\frac{39996.6 \\times 10^{-2}}{2 \\times 10^{-3}} \\text{ Pa} = 19998.3 \\times 10^{1} \\text{ Pa}$$\n$$\\sigma_c = 199983 \\text{ Pa}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer in megapascals (MPa).

However, the tissue in an aneurysm is pathologically altered and significantly weaker than healthy tissue, with a UTS that can be much lower and highly variable. Therefore, even though the calculated stress is below the UTS of healthy tissue, it could be a critical value for a diseased, weakened aneurysmal wall, indicating a significant risk of rupture.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.200}\n$$", "id": "4797816"}, {"introduction": "While general guidelines for elective aortic repair are based on absolute diameter, a one-size-fits-all approach can be suboptimal.
