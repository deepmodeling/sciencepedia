This exercise moves beyond qualitative pattern recognition to the precise quantification of limb-lead voltage. By working through raw ECG measurements, correcting for non-standard recording gains, and applying a diagnostic threshold, you will develop the fundamental skill of rigorously evaluating an ECG for this critical sign, reinforcing your diagnostic acumen for infiltrative cardiomyopathies [@problem_id:4807391].", "problem": "A patient aged $68$ years with progressive exertional dyspnea and peripheral edema is evaluated for suspected infiltrative cardiomyopathy after transthoracic echocardiography shows interventricular septal thickness of $16$ millimeters. To refine pretest probability for cardiac amyloidosis, you are asked to assess for low QRS voltage on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Low limb-lead QRS voltage is commonly assessed using peak-to-peak QRS amplitudes in the six limb leads at standard calibration of $10$ millimeters per millivolt.\n\nYou are provided with peak-to-peak QRS complex measurements (in millimeters on paper) for three consecutive sinus beats in each limb lead. Due to a recording artifact, not all leads were captured at the same gain. The per-lead paper gain (in millimeters per millivolt) is listed, along with the three measured peak-to-peak QRS values (in millimeters on paper):\n\n- Lead I, gain $10$: $2.8$, $3.2$, $3.0$\n- Lead II, gain $10$: $4.5$, $4.7$, $4.6$\n- Lead III, gain $10$: $3.8$, $4.1$, $4.0$\n- Lead aVR, gain $5$: $1.6$, $1.8$, $1.7$\n- Lead aVL, gain $10$: $1.9$, $2.1$, $2.0$\n- Lead aVF, gain $5$: $2.2$, $2.0$, $2.1$\n\nUsing the following foundational facts:\n- The peak-to-peak QRS amplitude in millivolts equals the measured peak-to-peak height in millimeters divided by the paper gain in millimeters per millivolt.\n- To express each lead’s QRS amplitude as it would appear at standard calibration of $10$ millimeters per millivolt, convert the amplitude to millivolts and then scale by $10$ millimeters per millivolt.\n- To mitigate beat-to-beat variability, use the median of the three provided beats per lead as the representative peak-to-peak measurement for that lead.\n\nTasks:\n1. For each limb lead, compute the median peak-to-peak QRS amplitude at standard calibration of $10$ millimeters per millivolt.\n2. Compute the limb-lead QRS voltage sum by summing the six per-lead values obtained in Task $1$.\n3. Based on the limb-lead QRS voltage sum, classify whether the limb-lead low-voltage threshold is met if the limb-lead sum is less than $30$ millimeters.

Determine the representative peak-to-peak QRS measurement for each lead by finding the median of the three given measurements.\n2. Convert this median measurement (in millimeters, mm) to a voltage (in millivolts, mV) using the lead-specific gain (in mm/mV). The formula is: Voltage (mV) = Measurement (mm) / Gain (mm/mV).\n3.
