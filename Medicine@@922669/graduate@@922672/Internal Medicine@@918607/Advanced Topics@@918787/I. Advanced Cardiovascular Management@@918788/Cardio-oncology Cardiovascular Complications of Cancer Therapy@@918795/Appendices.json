This exercise provides practical experience in calculating the total doxorubicin-equivalent dose, a fundamental skill for risk stratification and guiding long-term surveillance for heart failure. [@problem_id:4808482]", "problem": "A patient with a high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma has received multiple anthracycline-containing regimens over two lines of therapy. In cardio-oncology practice, risk for anthracycline-associated cardiomyopathy is widely understood to increase with cumulative exposure, and clinical monitoring frequently references cumulative exposure in doxorubicin-equivalent units. Assume linear additivity of cardiotoxic potency across cycles and accepted potency equivalence factors relative to conventional doxorubicin (defined as factor $1.0$).

The stated assumption of linear additivity is a standard simplification used for this type of clinical risk assessment.\n\nThe task is to calculate the cumulative doxorubicin-equivalent anthracycline dose. This is achieved by summing the doxorubicin-equivalent dose contributions from each of the three administered drugs: conventional doxorubicin, epirubicin, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. The doxorubicin-equivalent dose for each drug is its total administered dose multiplied by its respective potency equivalence factor.\n\nLet $D_{dox,\\text{total}}$, $D_{epi,\\text{total}}$, and $D_{pld,\\text{total}}$ represent the total administered doses of conventional doxorubicin, epirubicin, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, respectively. Let the corresponding equivalence factors be $F_{dox}$, $F_{epi}$, and $F_{pld}$. The total cumulative doxorubicin-equivalent dose, $D_{eq,\\text{total}}$, is given by the formula:\n$$ D_{eq,\\text{total}} = (D_{dox,\\text{total}} \\times F_{dox}) + (D_{epi,\\text{total}} \\times F_{epi}) + (D_{pld,\\text{total}} \\times F_{pld}) $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total administered dose for each drug by summing the doses from each cycle.

The clinical scenario presented is a standard problem in the field of cardio-oncology, a subspecialty of internal medicine. The provided data are sufficient and consistent for a formal analysis. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe central task is to calculate the corrected QT interval (QTc) from a measured QT interval and heart rate. The QTc provides an estimate of the QT interval at a standardized heart rate of $60\\,\\mathrm{beats/min}$, allowing for consistent assessment of ventricular repolarization duration, which is a critical safety parameter in therapies known to affect cardiac ion channels.\n\nFirst, we must determine the RR interval, which represents the duration of one cardiac cycle, from the given heart rate ($HR$). The $HR$ is given in beats per minute, and the RR interval is required in seconds for the standard correction formulas.

The formula is:\n    $$QTc_F = \\frac{QT}{\\sqrt[3]{RR}}$$\n    Using the same values:\n    $$QTc_F = \\frac{0.420}{\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{2}{3}}} = 0.420 \\times \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{3}{2}} \\approx 0.48078\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n    In milliseconds, this is approximately $481\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nThe next step is to compare these values against the oncology safety threshold of $0.500\\,\\mathrm{s}$ ($500\\,\\mathrm{ms}$).\n-   The Bazett-corrected QTc is $QTc_B \\approx 514\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, which **exceeds** the $500\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ threshold.\n-   The Fridericia-corrected QTc is $QTc_F \\approx 481\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, which **does not exceed** the $500\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ threshold.\n\nThis discrepancy highlights the importance of the choice of correction formula. Bazett's formula is known to have a significant rate-dependent bias; it over-corrects at high heart rates (tachycardia) and under-corrects at low heart rates (bradycardia). The patient's heart rate of $90\\,\\mathrm{beats/min}$ is in the tachycardic range for a resting adult. Fridericia's formula demonstrates a more linear relationship between QT and RR intervals and is less influenced by heart rate extremes. For monitoring drug-induced QT prolongation, particularly with agents like arsenic trioxide and at heart rates deviating from the reference rate of $60\\,\\mathrm{beats/min}$, Fridericia's formula is considered more accurate and is often explicitly recommended in clinical guidelines and by drug manufacturers. The use of Bazett's formula in this case would overestimate the degree of QT prolongation and could lead to an incorrect clinical decision, such as the unnecessary interruption of a life-saving therapy.

The pharmacokinetic interaction between diltiazem (a moderate CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor) and apixaban (a CYP3A4/P-gp substrate) is factually correct and clinically significant. The specified reduction in clearance ($35\\%$) is consistent with published data.

There are no contradictions between the given constraints or objectives.\n- **Realism and Feasibility:** The patient profile, drug choices, physiological parameters, and pharmacokinetic interactions are all highly realistic and represent a common, complex clinical challenge.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, complete, consistent, and realistic. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of two components: the adjusted apixaban dose and the optimized resting heart-rate target. These will then be multiplied to find the composite index $I$.\n\n**Part 1: Adjustment of the Apixaban Dose**\nLet $D_0$ be the baseline single twice-daily dose and $CL_0$ be the baseline apparent clearance of apixaban. The baseline steady-state exposure, $C_{ss,0}$, is proportional to the ratio of the dosing rate to the clearance. Assuming a constant dosing interval, this simplifies to being proportional to the dose divided by clearance.\n$$C_{ss,0} \\propto \\frac{D_0}{CL_0}$$\nThe problem states that $D_0 = 5 \\text{ mg}$.\n\nWhen the patient is treated with diltiazem, the apparent clearance is reduced. Let the new clearance be $CL_{new}$ and the new adjusted dose be $D_{new}$. We are given:\n$$CL_{new} = 0.65 \\times CL_0$$\nThe goal is to adjust the dose $D_{new}$ to maintain the same steady-state exposure, i.e., $C_{ss,new} = C_{ss,0}$. The new exposure is given by:\n$$C_{ss,new} \\propto \\frac{D_{new}}{CL_{new}}$$\nSetting the exposures equal gives:\n$$\\frac{D_{new}}{CL_{new}} = \\frac{D_0}{CL_0}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $CL_{new}$:\n$$\\frac{D_{new}}{0.65 \\times CL_0} = \\frac{D_0}{CL_0}$$\nSolving for $D_{new}$ yields:\n$$D_{new} = 0.65 \\times D_0$$\nSubstituting the value for $D_0$:\n$$D_{new} = 0.65 \\times 5 \\text{ mg} = 3.25 \\text{ mg}$$\nThis is the adjusted single twice-daily apixaban dose.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Resting Heart-Rate Target**\nLet the resting heart-rate target be $HR_{opt}$ in units of beats per minute (bpm). This target must satisfy two constraints.\n\nConstraint 1: The lenient rate-control ceiling.\nThe resting heart rate must be less than $110$ bpm.\n$$HR_{opt} < 110$$\nConstraint 2: The diastolic filling requirement.\nThe duration of the cardiac cycle, $T_{cycle}$ in seconds, is the reciprocal of the heart rate in beats per second.\n$$T_{cycle} = \\frac{60}{HR_{opt}}$$\nThe cardiac cycle is the sum of the systolic and diastolic intervals: $T_{cycle} = T_{systole} + T_{diastole}$. We are given $T_{systole} \\approx 0.28 \\text{ s}$ and the constraint $T_{diastole} \\ge 0.25 \\text{ s}$.\nTherefore, the minimum required cardiac cycle duration is:\n$$T_{cycle} \\ge T_{systole} + T_{diastole,min} = 0.28 \\text{ s} + 0.25 \\text{ s} = 0.53 \\text{ s}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $T_{cycle}$ in terms of $HR_{opt}$:\n$$\\frac{60}{HR_{opt}} \\ge 0.53$$\nSolving for $HR_{opt}$:\n$$HR_{opt} \\le \\frac{60}{0.53}$$\n$$HR_{opt} \\le 113.2075... \\text{ bpm}$$\nTo satisfy both constraints, the target heart rate must be in the intersection of the two sets: $HR_{opt} < 110$ and $HR_{opt} \\le 113.2075...$. The combined condition is thus:\n$$HR_{opt} < 110 \\text{ bpm}$$\nThe problem asks for the \"most permissive value\" for the target. In a mathematical context, for an open interval of allowed values, this corresponds to the supremum of the set. The supremum of the set $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} | x < 110 \\}$ is $110$.\nThus, we set the optimized resting heart-rate target, $HR_{opt}$, to this boundary value.\n$$HR_{opt} = 110 \\text{ bpm}$$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Composite Index $I$**\nThe composite index $I$ is the product of the optimized resting heart-rate target and the adjusted apixaban dose.\n$$I = HR_{opt} \\times D_{new}$$\nSubstituting the values calculated in the previous parts:\n$$I = (110 \\text{ bpm}) \\times (3.25 \\text{ mg})$$\n$$I = 357.5 \\text{ bpm} \\cdot \\text{mg}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $357.5$ already has exactly four significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{357.5}$$", "id": "4808501"}]}
