It is scientifically grounded in the principles of cardiovascular physiology, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. The problem poses a clear, solvable task based on standard clinical definitions and data.\n\nThe task is to derive the expression for Right Ventricular Ejection Fraction ($RVEF$), compute its value for a given patient, and interpret the result based on provided clinical criteria for Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC).\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental definitions provided in the problem statement.\nLet $EDV_R$ denote the Right Ventricular End-Diastolic Volume, which is the volume of blood in the right ventricle at the end of diastole (filling).\nLet $ESV_R$ denote the Right Ventricular End-Systolic Volume, which is the volume of blood remaining in the right ventricle at the end of systole (contraction).\n\nThe Right Ventricular Stroke Volume, denoted as $SV_R$, is defined as the volume of blood ejected from the right ventricle in a single heartbeat. This is the difference between the end-diastolic volume and the end-systolic volume.\n$$SV_R = EDV_R - ESV_R$$\n\nThe Right Ventricular Ejection Fraction, $RVEF$, is defined as the fraction of the end-diastolic volume that is ejected during one contraction. This is expressed as the ratio of the stroke volume to the end-diastolic volume.\n$$RVEF = \\frac{SV_R}{EDV_R}$$\n\nTo derive the expression for $RVEF$ from first principles using the given variables, we substitute the expression for $SV_R$ into the equation for $RVEF$:\n$$RVEF = \\frac{EDV_R - ESV_R}{EDV_R}$$\nThis formula can also be written as:\n$$RVEF = 1 - \\frac{ESV_R}{EDV_R}$$\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $RVEF$ using the data provided for the $28$-year-old athlete.\nThe given measurements are:\n$EDV_R = 160\\,\\text{mL}$\n$ESV_R = 100\\,\\text{mL}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for $RVEF$:\n$$RVEF = \\frac{160 - 100}{160} = \\frac{60}{160}$$\n\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$RVEF = \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{3}{8}$$\n\nTo express this as a decimal, we perform the division:\n$$RVEF = 0.375$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. To represent $0.375$ with four significant figures, we must add a trailing zero, which is significant in this context.\n$$RVEF = 0.3750$$\n\nFinally, we interpret this result in the context of the Revised Task Force Criteria for ARVC assessment. The problem provides the following reference thresholds, which depend on the presence of regional wall motion abnormalities:\n- Major criterion: $RVEF \\leq 0.40$\n- Minor criterion: $0.40 < RVEF \\leq 0.45$\n\nOur calculated value is $RVEF = 0.3750$.

The provided information is sufficient and internally consistent.\n\nThe problem requires the classification of echocardiographic findings within the diagnostic framework for Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC), as defined by the 2010 revised Task Force Criteria. These criteria are the fundamental principles for this problem. They categorize imaging findings of right ventricular (RV) structural and functional abnormalities into major and minor criteria.\n\nFirst, let us state the 2010 Task Force Criteria for echocardiographic abnormalities in ARVC.\n\nA **major criterion** is met if there is:\nRegional RV akinesia, dyskinesia, or aneurysm\n**AND** one of the following:\n1.  Parasternal Long-Axis (PLAX) Right Ventricular Outflow Tract (RVOT) $\\ge 32\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ (or indexed to Body Surface Area [BSA], $\\ge 19\\ \\mathrm{mm/m^2}$)\n2.  Parasternal Short-Axis (PSAX) RVOT $\\ge 36\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ (or indexed to BSA, $\\ge 21\\ \\mathrm{mm/m^2}$)\n3.  Fractional Area Change (FAC) $\\le 33\\%$\n\nA **minor criterion** is met if there is:\nRegional RV akinesia or dyskinesia\n**AND** one of the following:\n1.  PLAX RVOT between $29\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and $31\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ (or indexed, $16-18\\ \\mathrm{mm/m^2}$)\n2.  PSAX RVOT between $32\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and $35\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ (or indexed, $19-20\\ \\mathrm{mm/m^2}$)\n3.  FAC between $34\\%$ and $40\\%$\n\nNow, we will systematically analyze the data provided in the problem statement against these criteria.\nThe given findings are:\n1.  Qualitative finding: Regional right ventricular akinesia on the free wall. This is a regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) that is a prerequisite for both major and minor criteria.\n2.  Quantitative finding 1: PLAX RVOT diameter = $33\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n3.  Quantitative finding 2: PSAX RVOT diameter = $37\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n4.  Quantitative finding 3: RV FAC = $31\\%$.\n\nWe compare each quantitative finding to the established thresholds for a major criterion:\n- For the PLAX RVOT diameter: The measured value is $33\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. The threshold for a major criterion is $\\ge 32\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. Since $33\\ \\mathrm{mm} \\ge 32\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, this measurement meets the quantitative component of a major criterion.\n- For the PSAX RVOT diameter: The measured value is $37\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. The threshold for a major criterion is $\\ge 36\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. Since $37\\ \\mathrm{mm} \\ge 36\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, this measurement also meets the quantitative component of a major criterion.\n- For the RV FAC: The measured value is $31\\%$. The threshold for a major criterion is $\\le 33\\%$. Since $31\\% \\le 33\\%$, this measurement also meets the quantitative component of a major criterion.\n\nThe diagnostic framework requires the presence of a regional wall motion abnormality (akinesia, in this case) combined with **at least one** of the quantitative abnormalities to satisfy a major criterion. In this patient, we have regional akinesia plus three separate findings (PLAX RVOT dimension, PSAX RVOT dimension, and FAC) that each independently satisfy the quantitative part of a major criterion. Therefore, the patient's echocardiogram unequivocally meets a major criterion for ARVC.\n\nHaving established this conclusion, we now evaluate each option.\n\n**A. Meets a major echocardiographic criterion for ARVC**\nThis statement is consistent with our derivation. The presence of regional RV akinesia plus a PLAX RVOT of $33\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ (which is $\\ge 32\\ \\mathrm{mm}$) is sufficient on its own to meet a major criterion. The other abnormal measurements (PSAX RVOT and FAC) further corroborate this, but only one is required.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Meets only a minor echocardiographic criterion for ARVC**\nThis is incorrect. The patient's quantitative measurements ($33\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ PLAX, $37\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ PSAX, and $31\\%$ FAC) all fall outside the specified ranges for minor criteria ($29-31\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, $32-35\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, and $34-40\\%$, respectively) and squarely into the major criterion category.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Does not meet echocardiographic criteria for ARVC**\nThis is incorrect. As demonstrated above, the findings clearly satisfy the definition of a major criterion based on the 2010 Task Force guidelines.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Meets a major echocardiographic criterion only if dimensions are indexed to body surface area, because absolute measurements are insufficient**\nThis is a misinterpretation of the guidelines. The criteria explicitly provide two pathways for qualification: absolute dimensions **OR** dimensions indexed to BSA. The word \"or\" indicates that either method is sufficient. In this case, the absolute measurements ($33\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and $37\\ \\mathrm{mm}$) are sufficient on their own, making indexing unnecessary for meeting the criterion.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Meets a major echocardiographic criterion only if both RVOT diameters and FAC are simultaneously abnormal; otherwise it is minor**\nThis is also a misinterpretation of the guidelines. The criteria require a regional wall motion abnormality **AND** (logical OR) one of the listed quantitative abnormalities. The use of \"one of the following\" in the guidelines signifies that only one of the list items (abnormal PLAX, abnormal PSAX, or abnormal FAC) needs to be present. Requiring them to be simultaneously abnormal is not part of the established framework.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, the patient's echocardiographic findings satisfy a major criterion for ARVC diagnosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4798160"}, {"introduction": "The diagnostic process for ARVC, like many conditions, is an exercise in probabilistic reasoning.

Express your final answer as a single decimal number (do not use a percentage sign). Do not use any pre-memorized shortcut formulas; derive the necessary relationships from first principles.", "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the post-test probability of a patient having arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) given a positive signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG). This will be accomplished using Bayes' Theorem, derived from the fundamental definitions of conditional probability, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\nFirst, let us define the relevant events:\n- Let $D$ be the event that the patient has ARVC (the disease is present).\n- Let $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have ARVC (the disease is absent).\n- Let $T$ be the event that the SAECG test result is positive.\n- Let $T^c$ be the event that the SAECG test result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we extract the following probabilities:\n1.  The pre-test probability of ARVC, which is the prior probability of the patient having the disease:\n    $$P(D) = 0.20$$\n2.  The probability of the patient not having the disease is the complement of $P(D)$:\n    $$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$$\n3.  The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease. This is a conditional probability:\n    $$P(T|D) = 0.60$$\n4.  The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease:\n    $$P(T^c|D^c) = 0.85$$\n\nOur objective is to find the post-test probability of ARVC given a positive test result, which is the conditional probability $P(D|T)$.\n\nAccording to the definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(T)}$$\nwhere $P(D \\cap T)$ is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive, and $P(T)$ is the total probability of testing positive.\n\nWe must express the numerator and the denominator in terms of the given quantities.\n\nFor the numerator, $P(D \\cap T)$, we can use the definition of conditional probability again:\n$$P(T|D) = \\frac{P(T \\cap D)}{P(D)}$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$P(D \\cap T) = P(T|D) P(D)$$\n\nFor the denominator, $P(T)$, we apply the law of total probability. A positive test result can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: either the patient has the disease and tests positive ($D \\cap T$), or the patient does not have the disease and tests positive ($D^c \\cap T$). Therefore, the total probability of a positive test is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n$$P(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap D^c)$$\nUsing the same rearrangement as for the numerator, we can write:\n$$P(T \\cap D) = P(T|D) P(D)$$\n$$P(T \\cap D^c) = P(T|D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSo, the expression for $P(T)$ becomes:\n$$P(T) = P(T|D) P(D) + P(T|D^c) P(D^c)$$\nWe have been given $P(T|D)$ and $P(D)$. We also know $P(D^c)$. The only missing term is $P(T|D^c)$, the probability of a positive test given the absence of the disease (the false positive rate). This can be derived from the specificity. Specificity is $P(T^c|D^c) = 0.85$. Since getting a positive result or a negative result are the only two outcomes for the test, we have:\n$$P(T|D^c) + P(T^c|D^c) = 1$$\nTherefore, the false positive rate is:\n$$P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for the numerator and denominator back into the main formula for $P(D|T)$. This yields Bayes' Theorem for this specific problem:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T|D) P(D) + P(T|D^c) P(D^c)}$$\n\nWe can now substitute the numerical values into this derived formula:\n- $P(D) = 0.20$\n- $P(D^c) = 0.80$\n- $P(T|D) = 0.60$\n- $P(T|D^c) = 0.15$\n\nThe numerator is:\n$$P(T|D) P(D) = (0.60) \\times (0.20) = 0.12$$\n\nThe denominator is:\n$$P(T) = (0.60) \\times (0.20) + (0.15) \\times (0.80)$$\n$$P(T) = 0.12 + 0.12 = 0.24$$\n\nFinally, we compute the post-test probability $P(D|T)$:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{0.12}{0.24} = 0.5$$\n\nThus, the post-test probability of the patient having ARVC, given the positive SAECG result, is $0.5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.5}$$", "id": "4798229"}]}
