{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Effective medication reconciliation and deprescribing begin with one foundational step: creating a Best Possible Medication History (BPMH). Without an accurate and complete list of what a patient is truly taking, any attempt to optimize their regimen is built on guesswork. This practice exercise challenges you to develop a systematic protocol for a complex but common clinical scenario, forcing you to integrate multiple data sources and navigate the pitfalls of incomplete records to ensure patient safety [@problem_id:4869311].", "problem": "A $58$-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic low back pain, generalized anxiety disorder, and hypertension is admitted for an acute COPD exacerbation. His electronic health record (EHR) medication list includes tiotropium, albuterol inhaler, lisinopril, sertraline, and hydrocodone-acetaminophen as needed. In a structured intake interview, he reports using a national chain pharmacy near his workplace for most prescriptions but sometimes using a neighborhood independent pharmacy near home. He volunteers that he has occasionally paid cash for “a few” fills of his pain medication “to avoid insurance hassles.” He lives near a state border and occasionally works across the line. There is no recent primary care follow-up note reconciling medications. The admitting team is tasked with completing a Best Possible Medication History (BPMH) and initiating deprescribing where appropriate.\n\nYou are asked to select the most appropriate protocol to achieve a BPMH that maximizes detection of potential undisclosed controlled substance fills paid in cash, while respecting typical legal and ethical constraints and creating a pragmatic workflow for internal medicine admission. Use the following foundational facts and definitions:\n\n- Best Possible Medication History (BPMH) is defined as the most accurate medication history achievable by using multiple sources, including a structured patient interview and at least one additional reliable source, such as medication containers, pharmacy fill records, and the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP), to reconcile medication names, doses, routes, frequencies, indications, prescribers, and fill dates.\n- The Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) is a state-run database that collects dispensings of controlled substances from pharmacies and some dispensers, typically regardless of payment source; cash transactions are expected to be reported. Many states enable interstate data sharing such that clinicians can query more than one jurisdiction when treating a patient who may cross state lines, subject to state law and institutional policy.\n- Insurance claims databases and EHR medication lists may omit cash transactions, out-of-network pharmacies, and recent fills not yet adjudicated; pharmacy dispensing records may be siloed across chains and independents.\n- A urine drug screen (UDS) detects presence of some substances with variable windows of detection and cannot reliably reconstruct a complete medication list, doses, or fill patterns; false positives and negatives occur and UDS is not a substitute for BPMH.\n- Ethical deprescribing requires identification of current medications, assessment of indication, benefit-risk balance, and patient-centered planning; abrupt discontinuation of opioids or benzodiazepines without assessment can cause harm.\n\nWhich protocol is most appropriate to achieve the stated goal?\n\nA. Rely on the EHR medication list, then conduct a brief patient interview to confirm names and doses. Call the preferred chain pharmacy only to verify last fill dates. Query the PDMP only if the patient provides explicit consent; do not inventory bottles to avoid privacy concerns. Reconcile and proceed to deprescribe any controlled substances not on the chain pharmacy’s profile.\n\nB. Perform a standardized BPMH workflow that includes: a structured, open-ended patient interview; a “brown-bag” review of all medication containers with visual inspection of labels for pharmacy, prescriber, strength, and fill dates; proactive calls to all pharmacies identified in the interview and in prior records to obtain dispensing histories for the past $12$ months; querying the PDMP for the home state and, if available and applicable, neighboring state(s) through interstate data sharing, irrespective of insurance or cash payment; cross-checking for duplicate or overlapping controlled substance fills; and contemporaneous documentation of discrepancies with source attribution. If discrepancies suggesting undisclosed controlled substance use are found, notify the attending prescriber, calculate morphine milligram equivalents (MME) as needed, and initiate a patient-centered risk-benefit discussion to plan safe continuation, tapering, or substitution, with monitoring.\n\nC. Export insurance claims data for the past $6$ months and reconcile with the EHR list. If these sources match, accept the list as complete. Assume that cash transactions are not relevant because they are not on insurance, and thus a PDMP query is unnecessary. Proceed to deprescribe controlled substances that are not supported by a recent claim.\n\nD. Order a comprehensive UDS and base the BPMH on laboratory results, using detected substances to infer active prescriptions and doses. Do not contact pharmacies or query the PDMP because laboratory data are objective. Use the UDS to guide deprescribing decisions.\n\nE. Ask the family to bring all medications to the bedside and discard duplicates. Avoid querying the PDMP to prevent potential legal liability. On admission, discontinue all controlled substances to eliminate risk, and consider restarting them later only if withdrawal occurs or pain is uncontrolled.", "solution": "The user has provided a clinical scenario and a set of foundational facts and definitions, asking for the selection of the most appropriate protocol for creating a Best Possible Medication History (BPMH) and initiating deprescribing. The primary goal is to maximize the detection of potential undisclosed controlled substance fills paid in cash.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Patient: `$58$-year-old male with COPD, chronic low back pain, generalized anxiety disorder, hypertension, admitted for a COPD exacerbation.\n- EHR Medication List: Tiotropium, albuterol inhaler, lisinopril, sertraline, hydrocodone-acetaminophen as needed.\n- Patient History: Uses a national chain pharmacy and a local independent pharmacy. Has paid cash for pain medication fills. Lives near a state border and works across it. No recent primary care medication reconciliation.\n- Task: Complete a BPMH to maximize detection of undisclosed controlled substance fills and initiate deprescribing. The protocol must be pragmatic, legal, and ethical.\n- Foundational Facts and Definitions:\n    1.  **BPMH:** Requires a structured patient interview plus at least one additional reliable source (e.g., medication containers, pharmacy records, PDMP).\n    2.  **PDMP:** State-run database tracking controlled substance dispensings, including cash transactions. Interstate data sharing is often available.\n    3.  **Data Source Limitations:** EHRs and insurance claims are incomplete, often missing cash transactions and out-of-network fills.\n    4.  **UDS Limitations:** A urine drug screen (UDS) is not a substitute for a BPMH, as it cannot confirm doses, frequencies, or fill patterns.\n    5.  **Ethical Deprescribing:** Requires a full medication assessment and patient-centered planning; abrupt discontinuation of certain substances can cause harm.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is valid. It presents a realistic and complex clinical scenario that is common in internal medicine. The task is well-defined, with a clear objective and a set of constraints. The \"foundational facts\" provide a consistent, scientifically grounded framework for evaluating the options, effectively acting as axioms for the problem. The scenario is free of contradictions, scientific inaccuracies, or subjective claims. It is a well-posed problem in clinical decision-making.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed to derive the solution and evaluate the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe stated goal is to select a protocol that *maximizes detection* of undisclosed controlled substance use, which, in this patient's case, is suggested by his use of multiple pharmacies, cash payments, and cross-border activity. The optimal protocol must therefore utilize the most effective tools for uncovering this specific information, as described by the provided foundational facts.\n\n1.  A \"Best Possible Medication History\" by definition requires using multiple sources beyond just the patient interview.\n2.  The Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) is defined as the key tool for tracking controlled substances, `regardless of payment source`. This makes it essential for detecting cash fills. The availability of interstate data sharing makes it the ideal tool for a patient who crosses state lines.\n3.  The patient's own medication containers (\"brown-bag\" review) and direct calls to all identified pharmacies are also defined as reliable sources.\n4.  Insurance claims and EHR lists are explicitly defined as potentially incomplete.\n5.  A UDS is explicitly defined as an inadequate substitute for a BPMH.\n6.  Ethical deprescribing explicitly forbids the abrupt discontinuation of opioids without a proper assessment and plan.\n\nThe most appropriate protocol must therefore be comprehensive, leveraging a structured interview, a review of physical medications, calls to all known pharmacies, and, critically, a multi-state PDMP query. Any subsequent action based on discovered discrepancies must be patient-centered and prioritize safety over punitive measures.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Rely on the EHR medication list, then conduct a brief patient interview to confirm names and doses. Call the preferred chain pharmacy only to verify last fill dates. Query the PDMP only if the patient provides explicit consent; do not inventory bottles to avoid privacy concerns. Reconcile and proceed to deprescribe any controlled substances not on the chain pharmacy’s profile.**\n\n**Analysis:** This protocol is patently inadequate. It relies on a \"brief\" interview and incomplete data sources (only one pharmacy). It avoids a \"brown-bag\" review of medication bottles, discarding a key source of information. It makes the PDMP query, the single most important tool for the stated goal, contingent and potentially omits it. Most critically, its plan to \"deprescribe any controlled substances not on the chain pharmacy’s profile\" is based on incomplete data and represents an unsafe, abrupt discontinuation, directly contradicting the definition of ethical deprescribing.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Perform a standardized BPMH workflow that includes: a structured, open-ended patient interview; a “brown-bag” review of all medication containers with visual inspection of labels for pharmacy, prescriber, strength, and fill dates; proactive calls to all pharmacies identified in the interview and in prior records to obtain dispensing histories for the past `$12$` months; querying the PDMP for the home state and, if available and applicable, neighboring state(s) through interstate data sharing, irrespective of insurance or cash payment; cross-checking for duplicate or overlapping controlled substance fills; and contemporaneous documentation of discrepancies with source attribution. If discrepancies suggesting undisclosed controlled substance use are found, notify the attending prescriber, calculate morphine milligram equivalents (MME) as needed, and initiate a patient-centered risk-benefit discussion to plan safe continuation, tapering, or substitution, with monitoring.**\n\n**Analysis:** This protocol is the gold standard and directly aligns with all the foundational facts. It employs multiple reliable sources (structured interview, brown-bag review, all identified pharmacies, multi-state PDMP query), which is the definition of a BPMH. It specifically utilizes the PDMP to address the risks of multiple pharmacies, cash payments, and cross-border activity, thus maximizing the chance of detection. The follow-up actions (calculating MME, patient-centered discussion, safe tapering/continuation) are the epitome of the ethical and evidence-based management of opioid use, avoiding the harm of abrupt discontinuation.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**C. Export insurance claims data for the past `$6$` months and reconcile with the EHR list. If these sources match, accept the list as complete. Assume that cash transactions are not relevant because they are not on insurance, and thus a PDMP query is unnecessary. Proceed to deprescribe controlled substances that are not supported by a recent claim.**\n\n**Analysis:** This protocol is built on a false premise. The foundational facts state that insurance claims data may omit cash transactions, and the patient admitted to paying with cash. Assuming cash transactions are \"not relevant\" is a direct contradiction of the problem's context and goal. Avoiding the PDMP query guarantees failure in detecting the undisclosed fills. This method does not constitute a BPMH.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Order a comprehensive UDS and base the BPMH on laboratory results, using detected substances to infer active prescriptions and doses. Do not contact pharmacies or query the PDMP because laboratory data are objective. Use the UDS to guide deprescribing decisions.**\n\n**Analysis:** This protocol misinterprets the utility of a UDS. The foundational facts explicitly state that a UDS \"is not a substitute for BPMH\" and \"cannot reliably reconstruct a complete medication list, doses, or fill patterns.\" While objective, the data from a UDS are insufficient for creating a BPMH and cannot provide the necessary detail for safe deprescribing (e.g., dose, frequency, last fill date). Ignoring the PDMP and pharmacy records is a critical omission.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Ask the family to bring all medications to the bedside and discard duplicates. Avoid querying the PDMP to prevent potential legal liability. On admission, discontinue all controlled substances to eliminate risk, and consider restarting them later only if withdrawal occurs or pain is uncontrolled.**\n\n**Analysis:** This protocol is dangerous and unethical. First, avoiding the PDMP for fear of liability is misguided; failure to use available safety tools like the PDMP often increases liability. Second, the instruction to \"discontinue all controlled substances to eliminate risk\" is medically reckless. As stated in the foundational facts, abrupt discontinuation of opioids can cause significant harm from withdrawal. This approach prioritizes a simplistic (and incorrect) view of risk mitigation over patient safety and constitutes malpractice.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4869311"}, {"introduction": "Polypharmacy is not just about the number of pills, but also the cumulative risk from their pharmacologic properties. This exercise introduces the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) score, a vital tool for quantifying the risk of cognitive and physical side effects from a common class of medications. By applying the ACB scale, you will practice identifying high-risk drugs and selecting safer alternatives, a core competency in geriatric medicine and thoughtful deprescribing [@problem_id:4869369].", "problem": "A hospitalized patient in internal medicine is undergoing medication reconciliation and deprescribing.

The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The clinical scenario, drugs, and the ACB scoring system are standard in the field of internal and geriatric medicine. All necessary data for the calculation are provided.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the total initial ACB score, which we will denote as $S_{initial}$. The problem states that the total regimen burden is the sum of the drug-specific scores. The patient's initial regimen consists of three medications: amitriptyline, oxybutynin, and diphenhydramine.\n\nThe given ACB scores for the initial medications are:\n- Amitriptyline: $ACB_{amitriptyline} = 3$\n- Oxybutynin: $ACB_{oxybutynin} = 3$\n- Diphenhydramine: $ACB_{diphenhydramine} = 3$\n\nThe total initial score, $S_{initial}$, is the sum of these individual scores:\n$$S_{initial} = ACB_{amitriptyline} + ACB_{oxybutynin} + ACB_{diphenhydramine}$$\n$$S_{initial} = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9$$\n\nNext, we must calculate the total final ACB score, denoted as $S_{final}$, after the proposed substitutions are implemented.

No scientific, logical, or structural flaws are identified.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires a quantitative definition of Morphine Milligram Equivalent (MME). MME is a standardized measure used to quantify the total analgesic potency of opioids a patient consumes over a $24$-hour period. It is expressed as the equivalent dose of oral morphine in milligrams. This value allows for the comparison and summation of different opioids in a patient's regimen, providing a single metric to assess total opioid exposure and an associated risk of adverse outcomes.\n\nQuantitatively, the total daily MME for a regimen is the sum of the MME contributions from each individual opioid. The MME for a single opioid is calculated by multiplying its total daily dose (in mg) by its specific equianalgesic oral morphine conversion factor. This can be represented by the formula:\n$$\n\\text{Total Daily MME} = \\sum_{i} \\left( \\text{Total daily dose of opioid}_i \\times \\text{Conversion Factor}_i \\right)\n$$\nwhere the index $i$ ranges over all opioids in the regimen.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to compute the total daily MME for the given patient.\n\nLet $MME_{\\text{total}}$ be the total daily MME.\nLet $D_{\\text{oxy}}$ and $D_{\\text{hydro}}$ be the daily doses of oxycodone and hydromorphone, respectively.\nLet $C_{\\text{oxy}}$ and $C_{\\text{hydro}}$ be their respective conversion factors.\nThe total daily MME is given by:\n$$\nMME_{\\text{total}} = (D_{\\text{oxy}} \\times C_{\\text{oxy}}) + (D_{\\text{hydro}} \\times C_{\\text{hydro}})\n$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total daily dose for each medication.\n\nFor oral oxycodone:\nThe dose is $10$ mg per administration.\nThe frequency is every $6$ hours (q$6$h). The number of administrations per day is $\\frac{24 \\text{ hours/day}}{6 \\text{ hours/dose}} = 4$ doses/day.\nThe total daily dose of oxycodone is:\n$$\nD_{\\text{oxy}} = 10 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dose}} \\times 4 \\, \\frac{\\text{doses}}{\\text{day}} = 40 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\n\nFor oral hydromorphone:\nThe dose is $2$ mg per administration.\nThe frequency is every $8$ hours (q$8$h). The number of administrations per day is $\\frac{24 \\text{ hours/day}}{8 \\text{ hours/dose}} = 3$ doses/day.\nThe total daily dose of hydromorphone is:\n$$\nD_{\\text{hydro}} = 2 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dose}} \\times 3 \\, \\frac{\\text{doses}}{\\text{day}} = 6 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\n\nNext, we use the given conversion factors to calculate the MME for each medication.\nThe conversion factor for oral oxycodone is $C_{\\text{oxy}} = 1.5$.\nThe conversion factor for oral hydromorphone is $C_{\\text{hydro}} = 4$.\n\nThe MME contribution from oxycodone is:\n$$\nMME_{\\text{oxy}} = D_{\\text{oxy}} \\times C_{\\text{oxy}} = 40 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}} \\times 1.5 = 60 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg morphine}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\n\nThe MME contribution from hydromorphone is:\n$$\nMME_{\\text{hydro}} = D_{\\text{hydro}} \\times C_{\\text{hydro}} = 6 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}} \\times 4 = 24 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg morphine}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we sum the MME contributions to find the total daily MME for the patient's regimen:\n$$\nMME_{\\text{total}} = MME_{\\text{oxy}} + MME_{\\text{hydro}} = 60 + 24 = 84 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg morphine}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
