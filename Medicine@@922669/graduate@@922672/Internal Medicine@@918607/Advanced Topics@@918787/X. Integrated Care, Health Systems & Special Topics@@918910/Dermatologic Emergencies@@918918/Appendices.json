The use of the Cockcroft-Gault equation to estimate renal function, and the subsequent dose adjustment of renally-cleared drugs like acyclovir and vancomycin, is a standard and critical practice in medicine. The pharmacokinetic targets ($C_{ss,avg}$ and $AUC_{24}/MIC$) are conventional metrics for assessing drug exposure and efficacy. The clinical scenario is realistic.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary patient data ($Age$, $W$, $SCr$) to calculate the required parameter ($CrCl$). The objectives for dose adjustment are clearly and unambiguously defined for each drug. Sufficient information is provided to establish a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective (Critical):** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased medical and mathematical language. There are no subjective or opinion-based elements.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. It explicitly states the formula to use (Cockcroft-Gault), the assumptions to make ($CL \\propto CrCl$), and the goals to achieve. There are no internal contradictions. The patient's data are plausible for the described clinical state.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is a valid, well-posed, and scientifically sound exercise in applied pharmacokinetics. The solution process can proceed.\n\n## SOLUTION\n\nThe solution requires a three-step process: first, calculating the patient's estimated creatinine clearance; second, adjusting the acyclovir dosing interval; and third, adjusting the vancomycin per-dose amount.\n\n### 1. Estimation of Creatinine Clearance ($CrCl_{pt}$)\nThe Cockcroft-Gault equation for estimating creatinine clearance in adult males is:\n$$CrCl \\ (\\mathrm{mL/min}) = \\frac{(140 - Age) \\times Weight\\ (\\mathrm{kg})}{72 \\times SCr\\ (\\mathrm{mg/dL})}$$\nUsing the patient's data: $Age = 62$ years, $Weight = 78\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, and $SCr = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n$$CrCl_{pt} = \\frac{(140 - 62) \\times 78}{72 \\times 2.5} = \\frac{78 \\times 78}{180} = \\frac{6084}{180} = 33.8\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$$\nThis value represents the patient's estimated renal function, which will be used to scale the drug regimens.\n\n### 2. Acyclovir Dosing Interval Adjustment\nThe goal for acyclovir is to maintain the same steady-state average concentration ($C_{ss,avg}$) as a person with normal renal function. The formula for $C_{ss,avg}$ for an intravenously administered drug is:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{D}{CL \\times \\tau}$$\nwhere $D$ is the dose, $CL$ is the systemic clearance, and $\\tau$ is the dosing interval. We set the patient's average concentration equal to the normal reference concentration:\n$$C_{ss,avg,pt} = C_{ss,avg,norm}$$\n$$\\frac{D_{pt}}{CL_{pt} \\times \\tau_{pt}} = \\frac{D_{norm}}{CL_{norm} \\times \\tau_{norm}}$$\nThe problem states that the per-dose amount is held fixed, so $D_{pt} = D_{norm}$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$CL_{pt} \\times \\tau_{pt} = CL_{norm} \\times \\tau_{norm}$$\nSolving for the patient's adjusted dosing interval, $\\tau_{pt}$:\n$$\\tau_{pt} = \\tau_{norm} \\times \\frac{CL_{norm}}{CL_{pt}}$$\nThe problem states that drug clearance is directly proportional to creatinine clearance ($CL \\propto CrCl$). Therefore, the ratio of clearances is equal to the ratio of creatinine clearances:\n$$\\frac{CL_{norm}}{CL_{pt}} = \\frac{CrCl_{norm}}{CrCl_{pt}}$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $\\tau_{pt}$:\n$$\\tau_{pt} = \\tau_{norm} \\times \\frac{CrCl_{norm}}{CrCl_{pt}}$$\nUsing the given and calculated values: $\\tau_{norm} = 8\\,\\mathrm{h}$, $CrCl_{norm} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$, and $CrCl_{pt} = 33.8\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n$$\\tau_{pt} = 8\\,\\mathrm{h} \\times \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}}{33.8\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}} = 8 \\times \\frac{100}{33.8} \\approx 23.668639\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the adjusted acyclovir interval is $23.67\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\n### 3. Vancomycin Per-Dose Amount Adjustment\nThe goal for vancomycin is to maintain the same $24$-hour AUC/MIC ratio. Since $MIC$ is constant, this is equivalent to maintaining the same $AUC_{24}$. The $AUC$ over a $24$-hour period is given by the total dose administered in $24$ hours divided by the drug's clearance:\n$$AUC_{24} = \\frac{D_{total, 24h}}{CL}$$\nWe set the patient's $AUC_{24}$ equal to the normal reference $AUC_{24}$:\n$$AUC_{24,pt} = AUC_{24,norm}$$\n$$\\frac{D_{total, 24h, pt}}{CL_{pt}} = \\frac{D_{total, 24h, norm}}{CL_{norm}}$$\nSolving for the patient's total daily dose:\n$$D_{total, 24h, pt} = D_{total, 24h, norm} \\times \\frac{CL_{pt}}{CL_{norm}}$$\nUsing the proportionality $CL \\propto CrCl$:\n$$D_{total, 24h, pt} = D_{total, 24h, norm} \\times \\frac{CrCl_{pt}}{CrCl_{norm}}$$\nFirst, we calculate the normal total daily dose. The per-dose amount is $15\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$, and the interval is $12\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n$$D_{norm, per\\_dose} = 15\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg} \\times 78\\,\\mathrm{kg} = 1170\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nSince the interval is $12\\,\\mathrm{h}$, there are two doses in $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n$$D_{total, 24h, norm} = 1170\\,\\mathrm{mg/dose} \\times 2\\,\\mathrm{doses} = 2340\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nNow we can calculate the patient's required total daily dose:\n$$D_{total, 24h, pt} = 2340\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\times \\frac{33.8\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}}{100\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}} = 2340 \\times 0.338 = 790.92\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThis total daily dose must be administered over the fixed $12\\,\\mathrm{h}$ interval, meaning two doses per day. The adjusted per-dose amount, $D_{pt, per\\_dose}$, is half of the total daily dose:\n$$D_{pt, per\\_dose} = \\frac{D_{total, 24h, pt}}{2} = \\frac{790.92\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{2} = 395.46\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the adjusted vancomycin dose is $395.5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ every $12\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\n### Summary of Results\n1.
