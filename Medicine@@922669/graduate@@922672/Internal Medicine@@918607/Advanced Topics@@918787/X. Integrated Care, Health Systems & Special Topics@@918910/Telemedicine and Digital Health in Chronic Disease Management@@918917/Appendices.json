It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nLet $D^{+}$ be the event that a patient is truly experiencing impending decompensation, and $D^{-}$ be the event that the patient is not. Let $T^{+}$ be the event that the telemonitoring rule triggers an alert, and $T^{-}$ be the event that it does not.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe prevalence of impending decompensation is $P(D^{+}) = p = 0.10$.\nFrom this, the probability of a patient not having impending decompensation is $P(D^{-}) = 1 - P(D^{+}) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n\nThe sensitivity of the test is the probability of an alert given the patient is truly decompensating:\n$Se = P(T^{+} | D^{+}) = 0.85$.\nThe complementary probability, the false negative rate (FNR), is $P(T^{-} | D^{+}) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of no alert given the patient is not decompensating:\n$Sp = P(T^{-} | D^{-}) = 0.90$.\nThe complementary probability, the false positive rate (FPR), is $P(T^{+} | D^{-}) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV).\n\n**1. Derivation and Calculation of Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\n\nThe PPV is the probability that a patient is truly decompensating given that an alert has been triggered, i.e., $P(D^{+} | T^{+})$.\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, this is given by:\n$$PPV = P(D^{+} | T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} | D^{+}) P(D^{+})}{P(T^{+})}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^{+})$, is the total probability of an alert. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, summing over the two mutually exclusive states of the patient ($D^{+}$ and $D^{-}$):\n$$P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} | D^{+}) P(D^{+}) + P(T^{+} | D^{-}) P(D^{-})$$\nSubstituting the variables for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$P(T^{+}) = (Se)(p) + (1-Sp)(1-p)$$\nNow, substituting this expression for $P(T^{+})$ back into the formula for PPV, we obtain the derived expression:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1-Sp)(1-p)}$$\nNow we compute the numerical value using the given parameters: $p=0.10$, $Se=0.85$, and $Sp=0.90$.\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.85)(0.10)}{(0.85)(0.10) + (1-0.90)(1-0.10)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.085}{0.085 + (0.10)(0.90)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.085}{0.085 + 0.090}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.085}{0.175} \\approx 0.485714$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the PPV is $0.4857$.\n\n**2. Derivation and Calculation of Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\n\nThe NPV is the probability that a patient is not decompensating given that no alert has been triggered, i.e., $P(D^{-} | T^{-})$.\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^{-} | T^{-}) = \\frac{P(T^{-} | D^{-}) P(D^{-})}{P(T^{-})}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^{-})$, is the total probability of no alert. Using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^{-}) = P(T^{-} | D^{-}) P(D^{-}) + P(T^{-} | D^{+}) P(D^{+})$$\nSubstituting the variables for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$P(T^{-}) = (Sp)(1-p) + (1-Se)(p)$$\nSubstituting this expression for $P(T^{-})$ back into the formula for NPV, we obtain the derived expression:\n$$NPV = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1-p)}{Sp \\cdot (1-p) + (1-Se) \\cdot p}$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$NPV = \\frac{(0.90)(1-0.10)}{(0.90)(1-0.10) + (1-0.85)(0.10)}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{(0.90)(0.90)}{(0.90)(0.90) + (0.15)(0.10)}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.81}{0.81 + 0.015}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.81}{0.825} \\approx 0.981818$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the NPV is $0.9818$.\n\n**3. Implications for Nurse Workload**\n\nTo analyze the workload implications for a cohort of $N=1000$ patients over a $7$-day period, we reason from first principles by calculating the expected number of patients in each category.\n\nFirst, we determine the expected number of patients who are truly decompensating ($D^{+}$) and those who are not ($D^{-}$):\nExpected number of patients with impending decompensation: $E[N_{D^{+}}] = N \\cdot P(D^{+}) = 1000 \\cdot 0.10 = 100$.\nExpected number of patients without impending decompensation: $E[N_{D^{-}}] = N \\cdot P(D^{-}) = 1000 \\cdot 0.90 = 900$.\n\nNext, we calculate the expected number of alerts that will be generated. Alerts consist of True Positives (TP) and False Positives (FP).\nExpected number of True Positives (alerts from truly sick patients):\n$E[N_{TP}] = E[N_{D^{+}}] \\cdot P(T^{+} | D^{+}) = 100 \\cdot Se = 100 \\cdot 0.85 = 85$. These are the alerts that correctly identify a patient at risk.\n\nExpected number of False Positives (alerts from healthy patients):\n$E[N_{FP}] = E[N_{D^{-}}] \\cdot P(T^{+} | D^{-}) = 900 \\cdot (1-Sp) = 900 \\cdot 0.10 = 90$. These are false alarms.\n\nThe total expected number of alerts that the nursing staff must investigate is the sum of true and false positives:\n$E[N_{Alerts}] = E[N_{TP}] + E[N_{FP}] = 85 + 90 = 175$.\n\nThe implication for the remote nurse workload is that for this cohort of $1000$ patients, they can expect to receive and investigate $175$ alerts over a $7$-day period. The derived PPV of $0.4857$ signifies that for any given alert, there is only a $48.57\\%$ chance that the patient is truly decompensating. This is directly reflected in our expected numbers: the fraction of alerts that are true positives is $\\frac{E[N_{TP}]}{E[N_{Alerts}]} = \\frac{85}{175} \\approx 0.4857$.\n\nThis means that more than half of the alerts ($90$ out of $175$, or approximately $51.4\\%$) are false positives. The nursing staff must expend effort to review all $175$ alerts to identify the $85$ true cases. This high volume of non-actionable alerts creates a substantial workload and can lead to a phenomenon known as \"alert fatigue,\" where the clinical staff may become desensitized to alerts, potentially diminishing the system's effectiveness. The utility of the telemonitoring system is therefore critically dependent not only on its sensitivity and specificity but also on the prevalence of the condition in the monitored population, as a low prevalence can lead to a low PPV and a large number of false alarms, thereby increasing workload without a proportional clinical benefit.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.4857 & 0.9818 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "4903372"}, {"introduction": "Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) has transformed diabetes care, generating rich data streams that offer a detailed view of a patient's glycemic control.

It avoids subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective, providing a sufficient basis for a rigorous analysis. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary objective is to obtain unbiased and valid estimates for the mean systolic BP, $\\mu$, and the treatment effect, $\\Delta$. The choice of method for handling missing data is critical to achieving this. The provided information suggests that the missing data mechanism is likely a mixture of MCAR, MAR, and possibly MNAR. A principled analysis must account for these possibilities.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in contrasting an ad-hoc, deterministic method (LOCF) with a principled, stochastic method (MI).\n\n-   **Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF):** This method imputes a missing value $Y_{it}$ with the most recent observed value, $Y_{i,t^{\\ast}}$. This carries the strong, and likely incorrect, implicit assumption that the blood pressure has not changed since the last measurement, i.e., $Y_{it} = Y_{i,t^{\\ast}}$. In a hypertension study where treatment is intended to lower BP, there is a systematic downward trend. Imputing a missing value with an earlier, higher value will artificially inflate the mean BP, $\\mu$. This will lead to a biased estimate. The method also treats imputed values as if they were real observations, which leads to an underestimation of variance and artificially narrow confidence intervals.\n\n-   **Multiple Imputation (MI):** This method assumes the data are MAR, meaning any systematic differences between the missing and observed values can be explained by other observed variables, $X_{it}$. MI uses the relationship between variables in the observed data to create a predictive model for the missing values. It then draws multiple plausible values for each missing entry from the predictive distribution, creating several \"complete\" datasets. The analysis is run on each dataset, and the results are pooled using specific rules (Rubin's rules) that correctly account for the uncertainty introduced by the imputation. If the imputation model is correctly specified (i.e., it includes all relevant covariates from $X_{it}$), MI provides unbiased parameter estimates (like $\\mu$ and $\\Delta$) and valid standard errors.\n\nThe empirical observations that missingness is related to prior BP, adherence logs, and calendar effects strongly support an MAR mechanism. This makes MI a suitable candidate for the primary analysis. The observation about patients avoiding measurement on high-BP days suggests an MNAR mechanism, for which standard MI is not sufficient. This points to the need for sensitivity analyses.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Prefer LOCF under Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) because it preserves the marginal mean without modeling; MI can introduce unnecessary variance inflation when data are MCAR.**\nThis statement is flawed. LOCF does not preserve the marginal mean unless the underlying data process is stationary (i.e., has a mean of zero drift). In this problem, BP is expected to trend downward with therapy, so $E(Y_{it}) < E(Y_{i, t^{\\ast}})$ for $t>t^{\\ast}$. Carrying a past observation forward will therefore systematically bias the mean $\\mu$ upward. Furthermore, the claim that MI introduces \"unnecessary variance inflation\" is a mischaracterization. MI correctly propagates the uncertainty due to missingness into the final variance estimate, which is a crucial feature for valid inference. LOCF, by treating imputed values as certain, artificially deflates variance.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. Use MI under Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) and Missing At Random (MAR) by specifying an imputation model that conditions on $X_{it}$ including time, prior BP, treatment assignment, medication titration, adherence logs, and calendar effects; avoid LOCF except in the special case that the BP process is stationary with zero drift and missingness is MCAR.**\nThis argument is entirely principled. MI is the standard and theoretically justified method for handling data that are MCAR or MAR. A key requirement for valid MI is a properly specified imputation model that includes variables related to the outcome and to the probability of missingness. The covariates listed ($X_{it}$, time, treatment) are precisely the variables that should be included to satisfy the MAR assumption. The statement also correctly identifies the extremely restrictive and clinically implausible conditions under which LOCF would not introduce bias (a stationary process and MCAR).\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Under Missing Not At Random (MNAR) where high-BP days are less likely to be recorded, standard MI assuming MAR will generally recover unbiased estimates of $E(Y_{it})$, and LOCF is also unbiased because it retains the last measured high value on subsequent high-BP days.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. By definition, if the missingness mechanism is MNAR, an analysis that assumes MAR (such as standard MI) will produce biased estimates. The imputation model would be misspecified because it omits the direct dependence on the unobserved $Y_{it}$. The missing high-BP values would be imputed with values that are, on average, too low, leading to a downwardly biased estimate of $\\mu$. The justification for LOCF is also spurious; there is no theoretical basis to believe that the last observed value is a good proxy for a currently unobserved high value. This is a naive and biased approach under MNAR.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. When BP is trending downward due to therapy titration and missingness depends on observed history (e.g., prior BP, reminders) consistent with MAR, LOCF will bias the mean upward and attenuate estimated treatment effects; prefer MI with an imputation model that includes the time trend and treatment, and conduct MNAR sensitivity analyses (e.g., pattern-mixture or selection models with delta adjustments).**\nThis option presents a sophisticated and correct analysis of the situation.\n1.  **Bias of LOCF:** It correctly identifies that in the presence of a downward trend, LOCF will impute older, higher values, biasing the overall mean $\\mu$ upward.\n2.  **Attenuation of Treatment Effect:** It correctly deduces the consequence for the treatment effect $\\Delta$. Since the downward trend is stronger in the more effective treatment arm, the upward bias from LOCF will be more pronounced in that arm, making the intervention appear less effective and thus attenuating (shrinking) the estimated effect size.\n3.  **Proper Analysis Strategy:** It correctly advocates for MI with a comprehensive imputation model (including time trend and treatment) as the primary analysis under MAR. Critically, it also recommends performing sensitivity analyses using appropriate MNAR models to address the possibility of MNAR suggested by the qualitative data. This represents current best practice in clinical trial statistics.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. If the fraction of missing BP values is below $10\\%$, either LOCF or complete-case analysis will be essentially unbiased regardless of the missingness mechanism, so method choice is inconsequential for $\\mu$ and $\\Delta$.**\nThis statement invokes a common but dangerous fallacy. There is no universally safe threshold for the percentage of missing data below which bias can be ignored. The magnitude of bias is a function of both the proportion of missing data and the nature of the missingness mechanism. A small amount of data missing in a highly systematic way (e.g., the most extreme values are selectively missing, an MNAR mechanism) can induce substantial bias. The claim that the choice is inconsequential \"regardless of the missingness mechanism\" is patently false. For example, a complete-case analysis is known to be biased under most MAR and all MNAR scenarios.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "4903471"}]}
