The scenario, known as Simpson's paradox, is a classic and realistic illustration of confounding in observational studies. The use of social determinants of health (SDOH) as a stratification variable is standard practice in health services research and internal medicine.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data to perform the requested calculations. The definitions of risk, relative risk, and the Mantel-Haenszel method are standard and allow for the computation of a unique, meaningful solution.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative data and objective, standard terminology from the field of epidemiology. It is free from subjective claims or ambiguity.\n4.  **No other flaws detected**: The problem is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or outside the realm of scientific verifiability.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nLet $A$ denote Hospital $A$ and $B$ denote Hospital $B$. Let $R$ be the event of readmission. Let $S-$ and $S+$ denote the low and high social risk strata, respectively. Risk is defined as the conditional probability of readmission given the hospital and stratum.\n\n**Part 1: Stratum-Specific Readmission Risks**\n\nThe stratum-specific risk for a hospital is the number of readmissions divided by the number of discharges within that stratum.\n\nFor the low social risk stratum, $S-$:\n- Risk at Hospital $A$, $P(R | A, S-)$:\n  $$ P(R | A, S-) = \\frac{R_{A,S-}}{N_{A,S-}} = \\frac{60}{800} = \\frac{3}{40} = 0.075 $$\n- Risk at Hospital $B$, $P(R | B, S-)$:\n  $$ P(R | B, S-) = \\frac{R_{B,S-}}{N_{B,S-}} = \\frac{120}{1200} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.100 $$\nComparison: $0.075  0.100$. In the $S-$ stratum, Hospital $A$ has a lower readmission risk than Hospital $B$.\n\nFor the high social risk stratum, $S+$:\n- Risk at Hospital $A$, $P(R | A, S+)$:\n  $$ P(R | A, S+) = \\frac{R_{A,S+}}{N_{A,S+}} = \\frac{360}{1200} = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.300 $$\n- Risk at Hospital $B$, $P(R | B, S+)$:\n  $$ P(R | B, S+) = \\frac{R_{B,S+}}{N_{B,S+}} = \\frac{105}{300} = \\frac{21}{60} = \\frac{7}{20} = 0.350 $$\nComparison: $0.300  0.350$. In the $S+$ stratum, Hospital $A$ also has a lower readmission risk than Hospital $B$.\n\nVerification: In both the low-risk ($S-$) and high-risk ($S+$) strata, Hospital $A$ has a lower readmission risk than Hospital $B$.\n\n**Part 2: Crude Readmission Risks and Crude Relative Risk (RR)**\n\nThe crude risk is the overall risk for each hospital, aggregating across strata. This is calculated using the law of total probability, but is more directly computed from the total counts.\n\nTotal discharges and readmissions for Hospital $A$:\n- Total Discharges $N_A = N_{A,S-} + N_{A,S+} = 800 + 1200 = 2000$.\n- Total Readmissions $R_A = R_{A,S-} + R_{A,S+} = 60 + 360 = 420$.\n\nTotal discharges and readmissions for Hospital $B$:\n- Total Discharges $N_B = N_{B,S-} + N_{B,S+} = 1200 + 300 = 1500$.\n- Total Readmissions $R_B = R_{B,S-} + R_{B,S+} = 120 + 105 = 225$.\n\nCrude risk for Hospital $A$, $P(R|A)$:\n$$ P(R|A) = \\frac{R_A}{N_A} = \\frac{420}{2000} = \\frac{21}{100} = 0.21 $$\nCrude risk for Hospital $B$, $P(R|B)$:\n$$ P(R|B) = \\frac{R_B}{N_B} = \\frac{225}{1500} = \\frac{9}{60} = \\frac{3}{20} = 0.15 $$\n\nThe crude relative risk ($RR_{\\text{crude}}$) comparing Hospital $A$ to Hospital $B$ is the ratio of their crude risks:\n$$ RR_{\\text{crude}} = \\frac{P(R|A)}{P(R|B)} = \\frac{0.21}{0.15} = \\frac{21}{15} = \\frac{7}{5} = 1.4 $$\nDirection of crude comparison: Since $RR_{\\text{crude}} = 1.4 > 1$, the crude analysis suggests that Hospital $A$ has a $40\\%$ higher risk of readmission than Hospital $B$. This is a reversal of the stratum-specific findings and a classic example of Simpson's Paradox, caused by confounding by the social risk variable. Hospital $A$ has a much larger proportion of its patients in the high-risk $S+$ stratum ($1200/2000 = 60\\%$) compared to Hospital $B$ ($300/1500 = 20\\%$).\n\n**Part 3: Mantel–Haenszel Common Relative Risk**\n\nTo obtain an adjusted measure of association that accounts for the confounding effect of social risk, we compute the Mantel-Haenszel common relative risk, $RR_{MH}$. We can represent the data for each stratum $i$ (where $i=1$ for $S-$ and $i=2$ for $S+$) in a $2 \\times 2$ table format.\n\nStratum $1$ ($S-$):\n- Readmitted in Hospital $A$ ($a_1$) = $60$. Total in Hospital $A$ ($n_{11}$) = $800$.\n- Readmitted in Hospital $B$ ($c_1$) = $120$. Total in Hospital $B$ ($n_{12}$) = $1200$.\n- Total patients in stratum $1$ ($N_1$) = $800 + 1200 = 2000$.\n\nStratum $2$ ($S+$):\n- Readmitted in Hospital $A$ ($a_2$) = $360$. Total in Hospital $A$ ($n_{21}$) = $1200$.\n- Readmitted in Hospital $B$ ($c_2$) = $105$. Total in Hospital $B$ ($n_{22}$) = $300$.\n- Total patients in stratum $2$ ($N_2$) = $1200 + 300 = 1500$.\n\nThe Mantel-Haenszel relative risk is given by the formula:\n$$ RR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{a_i n_{i2}}{N_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{c_i n_{i1}}{N_i}} $$\n\nWe calculate the numerator and denominator terms.\n\nNumerator (weighted sum of events in the exposed group, Hospital A):\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{a_i n_{i2}}{N_i} = \\frac{a_1 n_{12}}{N_1} + \\frac{a_2 n_{22}}{N_2} $$\n$$ = \\frac{60 \\times 1200}{2000} + \\frac{360 \\times 300}{1500} $$\n$$ = \\frac{72000}{2000} + \\frac{108000}{1500} = 36 + 72 = 108 $$\n\nDenominator (weighted sum of events in the unexposed group, Hospital B):\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{c_i n_{i1}}{N_i} = \\frac{c_1 n_{11}}{N_1} + \\frac{c_2 n_{21}}{N_2} $$\n$$ = \\frac{120 \\times 800}{2000} + \\frac{105 \\times 1200}{1500} $$\n$$ = \\frac{96000}{2000} + \\frac{126000}{1500} = 48 + 84 = 132 $$\n\nNow, we compute the ratio:\n$$ RR_{MH} = \\frac{108}{132} $$\n\nTo reduce the fraction, we find the greatest common divisor of $108$ and $132$. Both are divisible by $12$.\n$108 = 12 \\times 9$\n$132 = 12 \\times 11$\n$$ RR_{MH} = \\frac{9}{11} $$\n\nThis adjusted relative risk of $\\frac{9}{11} \\approx 0.818$ indicates that, after adjusting for the confounding effect of social risk, the risk of readmission at Hospital $A$ is about $18.2\\%$ lower than at Hospital $B$.

The $PAF$ is defined as the fraction of hospitalizations in the target population that would be averted if the exposure (household food insecurity) were eliminated.\n\nLet $E$ denote the exposure status, where $E=1$ for individuals with food insecurity (exposed) and $E=0$ for individuals without food insecurity (unexposed).\nLet $D$ denote the outcome, where $D=1$ for hospitalization and $D=0$ for no hospitalization.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- The prevalence of exposure in the population, $p_e = P(E=1) = 0.35$.\n- The prevalence of non-exposure is therefore $P(E=0) = 1 - p_e = 1 - 0.35 = 0.65$.\n- The adjusted risk ratio, $RR = 1.6$.\n\nLet $R_1$ be the risk of hospitalization among the exposed, $R_1 = P(D=1|E=1)$.\nLet $R_0$ be the risk of hospitalization among the unexposed, $R_0 = P(D=1|E=0)$.\nThe risk ratio is defined as $RR = \\frac{R_1}{R_0}$. The problem states that the adjusted $RR$ can be interpreted as the causal risk ratio, which is crucial for this analysis.\n\nThe overall risk of hospitalization in the total population, $R_{total}$, can be expressed using the law of total probability:\n$$R_{total} = P(D=1) = P(D=1|E=1)P(E=1) + P(D=1|E=0)P(E=0)$$\nSubstituting the defined terms:\n$$R_{total} = R_1 p_e + R_0 (1-p_e)$$\n\nThe $PAF$ is the proportion of cases attributable to the exposure. It is the difference between the total observed risk and the risk that would be observed in a counterfactual scenario where the exposure is eliminated, expressed as a fraction of the total observed risk. In the counterfactual scenario, the entire population would experience the risk of the unexposed, $R_0$. This relies on the assumption of exchangeability.\nThe risk attributable to the exposure is $R_{total} - R_0$.\nThe population attributable fraction is therefore:\n$$PAF = \\frac{R_{total} - R_0}{R_{total}}$$\n\nWe can substitute the expression for $R_{total}$ into the $PAF$ formula:\n$$PAF = \\frac{(R_1 p_e + R_0 (1-p_e)) - R_0}{R_1 p_e + R_0 (1-p_e)}$$\nSimplifying the numerator:\n$$PAF = \\frac{R_1 p_e + R_0 - R_0 p_e - R_0}{R_1 p_e + R_0 (1-p_e)} = \\frac{p_e (R_1 - R_0)}{R_1 p_e + R_0 (1-p_e)}$$\nThis expression depends on $R_1$ and $R_0$ individually, which are not given. We must express the $PAF$ in terms of the given quantities, $p_e$ and $RR$. We can do this by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by $R_0$ (which must be non-zero, a condition for $RR$ to be well-defined):\n$$PAF = \\frac{p_e \\left(\\frac{R_1}{R_0} - \\frac{R_0}{R_0}\\right)}{\\frac{R_1}{R_0} p_e + \\frac{R_0}{R_0} (1-p_e)}$$\nSubstituting $RR = \\frac{R_1}{R_0}$ and $1 = \\frac{R_0}{R_0}$:\n$$PAF = \\frac{p_e (RR - 1)}{RR \\cdot p_e + (1-p_e)}$$\nThe denominator can also be written as $RR \\cdot p_e + 1 - p_e = p_e(RR - 1) + 1$.

The \"expected absolute number of events prevented per treated person\" is the definition of Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR).\nLet $N_A$ and $N_B$ be the number of treatment slots allocated to Group A and Group B, respectively. The policy implies:\n$N_A \\propto ARR_A$\n$N_B \\propto ARR_B$\nwhere $ARR_A$ and $ARR_B$ are the absolute risk reductions in each group due to the treatment.\n\nThe problem specifies that the treatment \"reduces individual risk by a constant relative proportion across groups\". This means the Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) is constant for both groups. Let this constant be $r$.\n$RRR = \\frac{I_{untreated} - I_{treated}}{I_{untreated}} = r$\n\nThe ARR for any group is related to its baseline incidence and the RRR:\n$ARR = I_{untreated} - I_{treated} = I_{untreated} \\times \\left( \\frac{I_{untreated} - I_{treated}}{I_{untreated}} \\right) = I_{untreated} \\times RRR$.\nThus, for our two groups:\n$ARR_A = I_A \\times r = 0.12 r$\n$ARR_B = I_B \\times r = 0.08 r$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Aligning Metric and Calculate Allocation**\n\nThe allocation of slots is proportional to the ARR for each group. The proportion of total slots, $p_A$, allocated to Group A is given by:\n$$p_A = \\frac{N_A}{N_{total}} = \\frac{ARR_A}{ARR_A + ARR_B}$$\nSubstituting our expressions for $ARR_A$ and $ARR_B$:\n$$p_A = \\frac{I_A \\times r}{I_A \\times r + I_B \\times r} = \\frac{I_A \\times r}{(I_A + I_B) \\times r} = \\frac{I_A}{I_A + I_B}$$\nThe ratio of slots allocated to Group A versus Group B is:\n$$\\frac{N_A}{N_B} = \\frac{ARR_A}{ARR_B} = \\frac{I_A \\times r}{I_B \\times r} = \\frac{I_A}{I_B}$$\nThis ratio, $\\frac{I_A}{I_B}$, is precisely the **Risk Ratio (RR)** we computed in Step 1.
