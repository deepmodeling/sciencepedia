Derivations of Measures**\n\n- **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR):** The ARR is the absolute difference in the risk of the outcome between the control and intervention groups. It quantifies the absolute effect of the intervention.\n$$\nARR = p_C - p_I\n$$\n\n- **Relative Risk (RR):** The RR, also known as the risk ratio, is the ratio of the risk in the intervention group to the risk in the control group. It quantifies the multiplicative effect of the intervention on the risk.\n$$\nRR = \\frac{p_I}{p_C}\n$$\n\n- **Odds Ratio (OR):** To define the OR, we must first define the odds of an event. The odds of an event is the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring.\nThe odds of the event in the control group is $Odds_C = \\frac{p_C}{1-p_C}$.\nThe odds of the event in the intervention group is $Odds_I = \\frac{p_I}{1-p_I}$.\nThe Odds Ratio is the ratio of these two odds.\n$$\nOR = \\frac{Odds_I}{Odds_C} = \\frac{p_I / (1-p_I)}{p_C / (1-p_C)} = \\frac{p_I(1-p_C)}{p_C(1-p_I)}\n$$\n\n- **Number Needed to Treat (NNT):** The NNT is the average number of patients who must be treated with the intervention to prevent one additional adverse outcome, compared to the control group. It is the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction.\n$$\nNNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} = \\frac{1}{p_C - p_I}\n$$\n\n**2. Computation of Measures**\n\nUsing the given risks, $p_C = 0.20$ and $p_I = 0.15$:\n\n- **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR):**\n$$\nARR = 0.20 - 0.15 = 0.05\n$$\n\n- **Relative Risk (RR):**\n$$\nRR = \\frac{0.15}{0.20} = \\frac{15}{20} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\n$$\n\n- **Odds Ratio (OR):**\nFirst, we find the odds for each group:\n$Odds_I = \\frac{0.15}{1-0.15} = \\frac{0.15}{0.85} = \\frac{15}{85} = \\frac{3}{17}$\n$Odds_C = \\frac{0.20}{1-0.20} = \\frac{0.20}{0.80} = \\frac{20}{80} = \\frac{1}{4}$\nNow, we compute the ratio of the odds:\n$$\nOR = \\frac{3/17}{1/4} = \\frac{3}{17} \\times 4 = \\frac{12}{17} \\approx 0.705882...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as instructed, we get $OR \\approx 0.7059$.\n\n- **Number Needed to Treat (NNT):**\n$$\nNNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} = \\frac{1}{0.05} = 20\n$$\nSince this is an exact reciprocal, it is reported as an integer.\n\n**3. Verbal Interpretation of Measures**\n\n- **ARR = 0.05:** The intervention with the new SGLT2 inhibitor reduces the absolute probability of hospitalization for heart failure by $0.05$ (or $5$ percentage points) over a $1$-year period compared to standard care.\n- **RR = 0.75:** A patient receiving the new intervention has $0.75$ times the risk (or $75\\%$ of the risk) of hospitalization for heart failure over $1$ year, compared to a patient receiving standard care. This is equivalent to a relative risk reduction of $1 - 0.75 = 0.25$ or $25\\%$.\n- **OR $\\approx$ 0.7059:** For any given patient, the odds of being hospitalized for heart failure while on the new intervention are approximately $0.7059$ times the odds of being hospitalized while on standard care.\n- **NNT = 20:** On average, one must treat $20$ patients with the new SGLT2 inhibitor for $1$ year to prevent one additional case of hospitalization for heart failure that would have occurred on standard care.\n\n**4. Relationship Between Odds Ratio (OR) and Relative Risk (RR)**\n\nThe OR and RR are distinct measures that are only equal under specific circumstances. Their mathematical relationship is:\n$$\nOR = \\frac{p_I(1-p_C)}{p_C(1-p_I)} = \\left(\\frac{p_I}{p_C}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1-p_C}{1-p_I}\\right) = RR \\times \\left(\\frac{1-p_C}{1-p_I}\\right)\n$$\nThe OR is equal to the RR multiplied by a \"correction factor\" $\\frac{1-p_C}{1-p_I}$.\n\nThe OR differs from the RR in this setting because the cumulative incidences (risks) of the event are not small. Specifically, $p_C=0.20$ and $p_I=0.15$. The correction factor is:\n$$\n\\frac{1-p_C}{1-p_I} = \\frac{1-0.20}{1-0.15} = \\frac{0.80}{0.85} = \\frac{80}{85} = \\frac{16}{17} \\approx 0.9412\n$$\nSince this factor is not equal to $1$, the OR will not be equal to the RR. For a beneficial treatment (where $p_I  p_C$), we have $1-p_I  1-p_C$, so the correction factor is less than $1$. This causes the OR to be smaller than the RR ($OR  RR  1$). Our calculated values confirm this: $OR \\approx 0.7059$ and $RR = 0.75$.\n\nThe OR approximates the RR only when the event is \"rare\", meaning $p_C$ and $p_I$ are both very close to $0$. In that case, $1-p_C \\approx 1$ and $1-p_I \\approx 1$, rendering the correction factor close to $1$. In this problem, an event risk of $20\\%$ is common enough for the two measures to diverge noticeably. The OR is a non-collapsible measure of association, and for a beneficial intervention, it will always show a stronger effect (i.e., its value will be further from the null value of $1$) than the RR, unless the event is rare.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$", "id": "4833368"}, {"introduction": "A diagnostic test's utility is not defined solely by its intrinsic accuracy but by its performance in a specific clinical context.

I will now proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has the chronic condition, and let $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have the condition.

Using Bayes' theorem, this is expressed as:\n$$\nP(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, by summing over the two mutually exclusive states (having the disease or not having the disease):\n$$\nP(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)\n$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$\nP(T^+) = (Se \\times P(D)) + ((1 - Sp) \\times (1 - P(D)))\n$$\nNow, substituting this denominator back into the Bayes' theorem expression for PPV gives the general formula:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{Se \\times P(D)}{(Se \\times P(D)) + ((1 - Sp) \\times (1 - P(D)))}\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.90 \\times 0.10}{(0.90 \\times 0.10) + ((1 - 0.80) \\times (1 - 0.10))}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.09}{0.09 + (0.20 \\times 0.90)}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.18} = \\frac{0.09}{0.27}\n$$\nAs an exact fraction, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{9}{27} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\n\n**Derivation of Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\n\nThe NPV, $P(D^c | T^-)$, is the probability that a patient does not have the disease given a negative test result. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nP(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test, found using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)\n$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$\nP(T^-) = (Sp \\times (1 - P(D))) + ((1 - Se) \\times P(D))\n$$\nNow, substituting this denominator back into the Bayes' theorem expression for NPV gives the general formula:\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{Sp \\times (1 - P(D))}{(Sp \\times (1 - P(D))) + ((1 - Se) \\times P(D))}\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = \\frac{0.80 \\times (1 - 0.10)}{(0.80 \\times (1 - 0.10)) + ((1 - 0.90) \\times 0.10)}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = \\frac{0.80 \\times 0.90}{(0.80 \\times 0.90) + (0.10 \\times 0.10)}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = \\frac{0.72}{0.72 + 0.01} = \\frac{0.72}{0.73}\n$$\nAs an exact fraction, this is:\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = \\frac{72}{73}\n$$\n\n**Interpretation of Results**\n\nThe calculated predictive values indicate the post-test probabilities of disease status. The pre-test probability of disease is the prevalence, $P(D) = 0.10$.\nA positive test result increases the probability of having the disease from $0.10$ to the PPV of $\\frac{1}{3}$ (approximately $0.33$). This demonstrates the significant influence of prevalence on PPV. Even with a highly sensitive test ($Se=0.90$), the relatively low prevalence in the clinic population means that a positive result still corresponds to only a $1$ in $3$ chance of having the disease. This is because the number of false positives from the large disease-free population ($P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c) = 0.20 \\times 0.90 = 0.18$) is twice the number of true positives from the smaller diseased population ($P(T^+|D)P(D) = 0.90 \\times 0.10 = 0.09$).\nConversely, a negative test result is highly informative. The pre-test probability of not having the disease was $P(D^c) = 0.90$. A negative test increases this probability to the NPV of $\\frac{72}{73}$ (approximately $0.986$). This means a negative result provides strong evidence to rule out the disease. The post-test probability of having the disease despite a negative test is very low: $1 - \\text{NPV} = 1 - \\frac{72}{73} = \\frac{1}{73}$.\nIn summary, the utility of this test in this specific clinic population is much greater for ruling out the disease (high NPV) than for ruling it in (low PPV), a direct consequence of the low background prevalence of the condition.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3}  \\frac{72}{73} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4833422"}, {"introduction": "Observational studies are indispensable in medicine but are susceptible to unmeasured confounding, which can create spurious associations.

We will proceed to derive the E-value from first principles and then calculate its value for the given data.\n\n**1. Derivation of the E-value Expression**\n\nThe objective is to quantify the required strength of an unmeasured confounder, $U$, to fully explain an observed association between an exposure, $E$, and an outcome, $D$. Let the observed risk ratio, adjusted for measured covariates $C$, be denoted by $RR_{obs}$. Let the true risk ratio, additionally adjusted for the unmeasured confounder $U$, be $RR_{true}$. The relationship between these quantities is mediated by a multiplicative bias factor, $B$, such that:\n$$RR_{true} = \\frac{RR_{obs}}{B}$$\nTo \"fully explain away\" the observed association means that the true risk ratio is equal to the null value, which is $1$.\n$$1 = \\frac{RR_{obs}}{B} \\implies B = RR_{obs}$$\nTherefore, we seek the minimum strength of confounding that can produce a bias factor $B$ equal in magnitude to the observed risk ratio $RR_{obs}$. For this derivation, we consider an observed risk ratio $RR_{obs}  1$.\n\nLet us model the associations using a binary unmeasured confounder $U$. Let $RR_{EU}$ be the risk ratio for the association between the exposure $E$ and the confounder $U$, and let $RR_{UD}$ be the risk ratio for the association between the confounder $U$ and the outcome $D$, conditional on the measured covariates $C$. We assume for a confounder to create a spurious positive association, it must be positively associated with both the exposure and the outcome, hence we assume $RR_{EU}  1$ and $RR_{UD}  1$.\n\nThe bias factor $B$ can be expressed in terms of the confounder's properties. Assuming the true causal risk ratio $RR_{ED|U,C} = 1$, the bias factor is given by:\n$$B = \\frac{P(D=1|E=1,C)}{P(D=1|E=0,C)} = \\frac{p_1(RR_{UD}-1)+1}{p_0(RR_{UD}-1)+1}$$\nwhere $p_1 = P(U=1|E=1,C)$ and $p_0 = P(U=1|E=0,C)$ are the prevalences of the confounder in the exposed and unexposed groups, respectively. The risk ratio $RR_{EU}$ is the ratio of these prevalences: $RR_{EU} = \\frac{p_1}{p_0}$, which implies $p_1 = p_0 \\cdot RR_{EU}$.\n\nTo find the maximum possible bias for given values of $RR_{EU}$ and $RR_{UD}$, we must maximize the expression for $B$ with respect to the unknown prevalence $p_0$.\n$$B(p_0) = \\frac{p_0 \\cdot RR_{EU}(RR_{UD}-1)+1}{p_0(RR_{UD}-1)+1}$$\nThe prevalence $p_1 = p_0 \\cdot RR_{EU}$ cannot exceed $1$, so $p_0 \\le \\frac{1}{RR_{EU}}$. Thus, $p_0$ is constrained to the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{RR_{EU}}]$. The expression for $B(p_0)$ is a fractional linear function of $p_0$. Its derivative with respect to $p_0$ is:\n$$\\frac{dB}{dp_0} = \\frac{(RR_{EU}-1)(RR_{UD}-1)}{(p_0(RR_{UD}-1)+1)^2}$$\nSince we assumed $RR_{EU}  1$ and $RR_{UD}  1$, the derivative is positive. Thus, $B(p_0)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $p_0$, and its maximum value occurs at the upper boundary of the domain of $p_0$, which is $p_0 = \\frac{1}{RR_{EU}}$.\n\nSubstituting $p_0 = \\frac{1}{RR_{EU}}$ into the expression for $B$ gives the maximum possible bias, $B_{max}$:\n$$B_{max} = \\frac{(\\frac{1}{RR_{EU}}) \\cdot RR_{EU}(RR_{UD}-1)+1}{(\\frac{1}{RR_{EU}})(RR_{UD}-1)+1} = \\frac{(RR_{UD}-1)+1}{\\frac{RR_{UD}-1}{RR_{EU}}+1} = \\frac{RR_{UD}}{\\frac{RR_{UD}-1+RR_{EU}}{RR_{EU}}} = \\frac{RR_{EU} \\cdot RR_{UD}}{RR_{EU} + RR_{UD} - 1}$$\nThis is the standard bounding relationship for confounding bias from a binary confounder. To explain away the observed effect, we need a bias factor at least as large as $RR_{obs}$. The minimum required confounder strengths will satisfy the equality:\n$$RR_{obs} = B_{max} = \\frac{RR_{EU} \\cdot RR_{UD}}{RR_{EU} + RR_{UD} - 1}$$\nThe E-value is defined as the minimal magnitude of association, $\\gamma$, assuming the confounder has the same strength of association with both exposure and outcome, i.e., $RR_{EU} = RR_{UD} = \\gamma$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$RR_{obs} = \\frac{\\gamma \\cdot \\gamma}{\\gamma + \\gamma - 1} = \\frac{\\gamma^2}{2\\gamma - 1}$$\nWe must solve this equation for $\\gamma$.\n$$RR_{obs}(2\\gamma - 1) = \\gamma^2$$\n$$\\gamma^2 - 2 \\cdot RR_{obs} \\cdot \\gamma + RR_{obs} = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $\\gamma$. Using the quadratic formula, $\\gamma = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{2 \\cdot RR_{obs} \\pm \\sqrt{(-2 \\cdot RR_{obs})^2 - 4(1)(RR_{obs})}}{2(1)}$$\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{2 \\cdot RR_{obs} \\pm \\sqrt{4 \\cdot RR_{obs}^2 - 4 \\cdot RR_{obs}}}{2}$$\n$$\\gamma = RR_{obs} \\pm \\sqrt{RR_{obs}^2 - RR_{obs}} = RR_{obs} \\pm \\sqrt{RR_{obs}(RR_{obs}-1)}$$\nThis gives two potential solutions for $\\gamma$. However, our derivation of the bound $B_{max}$ was premised on the assumption that $\\gamma = RR_{EU} = RR_{UD}  1$. We must determine which of the two roots is consistent with this assumption.\nThe larger root is $\\gamma_+ = RR_{obs} + \\sqrt{RR_{obs}(RR_{obs}-1)}$. Since $RR_{obs}  1$, $\\sqrt{RR_{obs}(RR_{obs}-1)}  0$, so $\\gamma_+  RR_{obs}  1$. This root is consistent with the assumption.\nThe smaller root is $\\gamma_- = RR_{obs} - \\sqrt{RR_{obs}(RR_{obs}-1)}$. For $RR_{obs}  1$, we can show that $\\gamma_-  1$. Consider the inequality $\\gamma_-  1$:\n$$RR_{obs} - \\sqrt{RR_{obs}^2 - RR_{obs}}  1$$\n$$RR_{obs} - 1  \\sqrt{RR_{obs}^2 - RR_{obs}}$$\nSince $RR_{obs}1$, both sides are positive. We can square both sides:\n$$(RR_{obs} - 1)^2  RR_{obs}^2 - RR_{obs}$$\n$$RR_{obs}^2 - 2 \\cdot RR_{obs} + 1  RR_{obs}^2 - RR_{obs}$$\n$$1  RR_{obs}$$\nThis last inequality is true by our initial condition that we are examining an observed harmful effect. Therefore, the smaller root $\\gamma_-$ is always less than $1$ and is inconsistent with the assumption $\\gamma  1$ used to derive the bounding formula.\nThus, the only valid solution is the larger root. This expression is the E-value.\n$$E\\text{-value} = RR_{obs} + \\sqrt{RR_{obs}(RR_{obs}-1)}$$\n\n**2. Calculation of the E-value**\n\nThe problem states the adjusted risk ratio is $RR_{obs} = 1.8$. We substitute this value into the derived formula:\n$$E\\text{-value} = 1.8 + \\sqrt{1.8(1.8 - 1)}$$\n$$E\\text{-value} = 1.8 + \\sqrt{1.8 \\times 0.8}$$\n$$E\\text{-value} = 1.8 + \\sqrt{1.44}$$\n$$E\\text{-value} = 1.8 + 1.2$$\n$$E\\text{-value} = 3.0$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the E-value is $3.000$.\n\n**3. Brief Interpretation**\n\nAn E-value of $3.000$ indicates that for an unmeasured confounder to fully account for the observed risk ratio of $1.8$, it would need to be associated with both corticosteroid use (the exposure) and serious infection (the outcome) by a risk ratio of at least $3.000$ each, conditional on the covariates already included in the model. This represents a moderately strong association. Within internal medicine, a decision-maker would need to assess the plausibility of an unmeasured or poorly measured factor (e.g., severity of the underlying COPD exacerbation) having an association of this magnitude. If such a confounder is deemed unlikely, the E-value of $3.000$ provides a degree of confidence that the observed association is robust to unmeasured confounding and might be causal. Conversely, if a plausible confounder of this strength exists, the causal interpretation of the finding is weakened.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.000}$$", "id": "4833490"}]}
