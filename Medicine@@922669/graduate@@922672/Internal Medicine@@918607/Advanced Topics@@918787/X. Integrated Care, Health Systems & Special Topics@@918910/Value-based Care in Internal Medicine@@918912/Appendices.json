The relative risk reduction (RRR) is applied to the baseline risk $p_0 = 0.10$. The formula is $p = p_0 \\times (1 - RRR)$.\n\n- **Strategy A:** $p_A = 0.10 \\times (1 - 0.05) = 0.10 \\times 0.95 = 0.095$\n- **Strategy B:** $p_B = 0.10 \\times (1 - 0.07) = 0.10 \\times 0.93 = 0.093$\n- **Strategy C:** $p_C = 0.10 \\times (1 - 0.12) = 0.10 \\times 0.88 = 0.088$\n\nNext, we compute the expected per-patient cost ($C$) and expected per-patient QALYs ($E$) for each strategy based on the provided formulas.\n\n**Expected Cost Calculation ($C$):** $C = (\\text{drug cost}) + (\\text{AE cost}) + p \\times (\\$20,000)$\n- **Strategy A:** $C_A = \\$120 + \\$4 + (0.095 \\times \\$20,000) = \\$124 + \\$1900 = \\$2024$\n- **Strategy B:** $C_B = \\$300 + \\$5 + (0.093 \\times \\$20,000) = \\$305 + \\$1860 = \\$2165$\n- **Strategy C:** $C_C = \\$420 + \\$10 + (0.088 \\times \\$20,000) = \\$430 + \\$1760 = \\$2190$\n\n**Expected QALY Calculation ($E$):** $E = u_0(1-p) + u_e(p) - (\\text{AE disutility})$\n- **Strategy A:** $E_A = 0.90 \\times (1 - 0.095) + 0.70 \\times 0.095 - 0.001 = 0.90 \\times 0.905 + 0.0665 - 0.001 = 0.8145 + 0.0665 - 0.001 = 0.8810 - 0.001 = 0.8800$ QALYs.\n- **Strategy B:** $E_B = 0.90 \\times (1 - 0.093) + 0.70 \\times 0.093 - 0.0011 = 0.90 \\times 0.907 + 0.0651 - 0.0011 = 0.8163 + 0.0651 - 0.0011 = 0.8814 - 0.0011 = 0.8803$ QALYs.\n- **Strategy C:** $E_C = 0.90 \\times (1 - 0.088) + 0.70 \\times 0.088 - 0.0009 = 0.90 \\times 0.912 + 0.0616 - 0.0009 = 0.8208 + 0.0616 - 0.0009 = 0.8824 - 0.0009 = 0.8815$ QALYs.\n\n**Task 3: Order by QALYs and Compute ICERs**\n\nThe strategies are ordered by increasing effectiveness (QALYs):\nStrategy A: $(C_A, E_A) = (\\$2024, 0.8800)$\nStrategy B: $(C_B, E_B) = (\\$2165, 0.8803)$\nStrategy C: $(C_C, E_C) = (\\$2190, 0.8815)$\nThe order of increasing effectiveness is A, B, C.\n\nNow we compute the ICERs for adjacent strategies in this order.\n- **ICER for B vs A:**\n$$ ICER_{B \\text{ vs } A} = \\frac{C_B - C_A}{E_B - E_A} = \\frac{\\$2165 - \\$2024}{0.8803 - 0.8800} = \\frac{\\$141}{0.0003} = \\$470,000 \\text{ per QALY} $$\n- **ICER for C vs B:**\n$$ ICER_{C \\text{ vs } B} = \\frac{C_C - C_B}{E_C - E_B} = \\frac{\\$2190 - \\$2165}{0.8815 - 0.8803} = \\frac{\\$25}{0.0012} = \\$20,833.33... \\text{ per QALY} \\approx \\$20,833 \\text{ per QALY} $$\n\n**Task 4: Dominance Analysis**\n\n- **Strict Dominance:** A strategy is strictly dominated if another strategy is both more effective (higher QALYs) and less costly.\n  - Comparing A, B, C: As we move from A to B to C, both cost and effectiveness increase.\n    - $C_A < C_B < C_C$ and $E_A < E_B < E_C$.\n  - Therefore, no strategy is strictly dominated by another.\n\n- **Extended Dominance:** This occurs when an intermediate strategy is not cost-effective compared_to a combination of less effective and more effective strategies. When strategies are ordered by effectiveness (A, B, C), if $ICER_{B \\text{ vs } A} > ICER_{C \\text{ vs } B}$, then strategy B is eliminated by extended dominance.\n  - We found $ICER_{B \\text{ vs } A} = \\$470,000$ per QALY.\n  - We found $ICER_{C \\text{ vs } B} \\approx \\$20,833$ per QALY.\n  - Since $\\$470,000 > \\$20,833$, the condition for extended dominance is met.
