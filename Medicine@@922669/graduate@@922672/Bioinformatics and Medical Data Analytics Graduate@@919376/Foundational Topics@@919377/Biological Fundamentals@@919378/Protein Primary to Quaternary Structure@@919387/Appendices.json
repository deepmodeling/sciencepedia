This calculation relies on the principles of acid-base chemistry, specifically the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, to determine the protonation state of each ionizable group within the peptide.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between $pH$, the acid dissociation constant ($pK_a$), and the ratio of the concentrations of the deprotonated (conjugate base, $[A^-]$) and protonated (acid, $[HA]$) forms of an ionizable group is given by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$\npH = pK_a + \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} \\right)\n$$\n\nThe average charge of an ionizable group can be calculated from the fraction of molecules in the charged state. We must distinguish between two types of ionizable groups: acidic groups and basic groups.\n\n1.  **Acidic Groups**: These groups are neutral when protonated ($HA$) and have a charge of $-1$ when deprotonated ($A^-$). Examples include the C-terminal carboxyl group, and the side chains of aspartate ($D$), glutamate ($E$), cysteine ($C$), and tyrosine ($Y$). The average charge, $q_{acidic}$, is given by the charge of the deprotonated form ($-1$) multiplied by the fraction of molecules in that form, $f_{A^-} = \\frac{[A^-]}{[HA] + [A^-]}$.\n    Rearranging the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives $\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = 10^{(pH - pK_a)}$.\n    The fraction $f_{A^-}$ is then $f_{A^-} = \\frac{10^{(pH - pK_a)}}{1 + 10^{(pH - pK_a)}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(pK_a - pH)}}$.\n    Therefore, the average charge of an acidic group is:\n    $$\n    q_{acidic} = (-1) \\times f_{A^-} = -\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(pK_a - pH)}}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Basic Groups**: These groups are neutral when deprotonated ($B$) and have a charge of $+1$ when protonated ($BH^+$). Examples include the N-terminal amino group, and the side chains of histidine ($H$), lysine ($K$), and arginine ($R$). The $pK_a$ for these groups refers to the dissociation of their conjugate acid, $BH^+ \\rightleftharpoons B + H^+$. The average charge, $q_{basic}$, is given by the charge of the protonated form ($+1$) multiplied by the fraction of molecules in that form, $f_{BH^+} = \\frac{[BH^+]}{[B] + [BH^+]}$.\n    The fraction $f_{BH^+}$ is $f_{BH^+} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[B]}{[BH^+]}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(pH - pK_a)}}$.\n    Therefore, the average charge of a basic group is:\n    $$\n    q_{basic} = (+1) \\times f_{BH^+} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{(pH - pK_a)}}\n    $$\n\nThe net charge of the entire peptide, $Q_{net}$, is the sum of the average charges of all its ionizable groups.

Round only the numerical fractions to four significant figures as specified.", "solution": "The solution is presented in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nPart A: Equilibrium Speciation\n\nThe system is governed by two simultaneous equations. The first is the definition of the dissociation constant, $K_{d}$, based on the law of mass action for the reaction $2P \\rightleftharpoons P_{2}$:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[P]^{2}}{[P_{2}]}$$\nThe second is the conservation of mass for the total concentration of protein subunits, $C_{t}$:\n$$C_{t} = [P] + 2[P_{2}]$$\nHere, $[P]$ represents the molar concentration of the monomeric protein and $[P_{2}]$ is the molar concentration of the dimeric form.\n\nOur goal is to solve for $[P]$ and $[P_{2}]$ given the values $K_{d} = 3.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $C_{t} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. We can express $[P_{2}]$ in terms of $[P]$ using the first equation:\n$$[P_{2}] = \\frac{[P]^{2}}{K_{d}}$$\nSubstituting this expression into the mass conservation equation yields an equation solely in terms of $[P]$:\n$$C_{t} = [P] + 2\\left(\\frac{[P]^{2}}{K_{d}}\\right)$$\nThis can be rearranged into a standard quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where the variable is $x = [P]$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{2}{K_{d}}\\right)[P]^{2} + [P] - C_{t} = 0$$\nWe solve for $[P]$ using the quadratic formula, $[P] = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with coefficients $a = \\frac{2}{K_{d}}$, $b = 1$, and $c = -C_{t}$.\n$$[P] = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4\\left(\\frac{2}{K_{d}}\\right)(-C_{t})}}{2\\left(\\frac{2}{K_{d}}\\right)} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{8C_{t}}{K_{d}}}}{\\frac{4}{K_{d}}}$$\nSince concentration must be a non-negative quantity, we take the positive root:\n$$[P] = \\frac{K_{d}}{4}\\left(-1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{8C_{t}}{K_{d}}}\\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values, $K_{d} = 3.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $C_{t} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. The units are consistent, so we can treat the numbers directly, and the resulting concentration will be in $\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n$$[P] = \\frac{3.5}{4}\\left(-1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{8 \\times 20}{3.5}}\\right)$$\n$$[P] = 0.875\\left(-1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{160}{3.5}}\\right) = 0.875\\left(-1 + \\sqrt{1 + 45.71428...}\\right)$$\n$$[P] = 0.875\\left(-1 + \\sqrt{46.71428...}\\right) = 0.875(-1 + 6.834785...)$$\n$$[P] = 0.875(5.834785...) \\approx 5.105437\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\nThe problem asks for the fraction of subunits present as monomer, $f_{\\mathrm{mon}} = \\frac{[P]}{C_{t}}$, and as dimer, $f_{\\mathrm{dim}} = \\frac{2[P_{2}]}{C_{t}}$.\n$$f_{\\mathrm{mon}} = \\frac{5.105437\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} \\approx 0.25527185$$\nBy definition, the fractions must sum to unity, since $f_{\\mathrm{mon}} + f_{\\mathrm{dim}} = \\frac{[P]}{C_{t}} + \\frac{2[P_{2}]}{C_{t}} = \\frac{[P] + 2[P_{2}]}{C_{t}} = \\frac{C_{t}}{C_{t}} = 1$.\nTherefore,\n$$f_{\\mathrm{dim}} = 1 - f_{\\mathrm{mon}} \\approx 1 - 0.25527185 = 0.74472815$$\nRounding both fractions to four significant figures as required:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{mon}} \\approx 0.2553$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{dim}} \\approx 0.7447$$\n\nPart B: Electrostatic Modulation of $K_{d}$\n\nThe relationship between the standard Gibbs free energy of binding ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}$) and the dissociation constant ($K_d$) is derived from the association constant $K_a = 1/K_d$. The standard relation is $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}} = -k_{B}T \\ln K_a$. Substituting $K_a$ gives:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}} = -k_{B}T \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{K_d}\\right) = k_{B}T \\ln K_d$$\nThe problem states that the binding free energy is composed of a non-electrostatic part, $\\Delta G_{0}$, and an ionic strength-dependent electrostatic part, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{elec}}(I)$:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{bind}}(I) = \\Delta G_{0} + \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{elec}}(I)$$\nThe electrostatic contribution is given by the Debye-Hückel screening model:\n$$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{elec}}(I) = -\\frac{\\lambda}{1 + \\kappa(I)\\,a}$$\nwhere $\\kappa(I) = \\sqrt{AI}$.\nCombining these gives the total binding free energy as a function of ionic strength $I$:\n$$k_{B}T \\ln K_{d}(I) = \\Delta G_{0} - \\frac{\\lambda}{1 + a\\sqrt{AI}}$$\nDividing by $k_{B}T$:\n$$\\ln K_{d}(I) = \\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{k_{B}T} - \\frac{\\lambda}{k_{B}T(1 + a\\sqrt{AI})}$$\nThe non-electrostatic term $\\Delta G_{0}$ is unknown. To eliminate it, we write the same equation for the reference condition at ionic strength $I_{0}$:\n$$\\ln K_{d}(I_{0}) = \\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{k_{B}T} - \\frac{\\lambda}{k_{B}T(1 + a\\sqrt{AI_{0}})}$$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first eliminates the $\\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{k_{B}T}$ term:\n$$\\ln K_{d}(I) - \\ln K_{d}(I_{0}) = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{k_{B}T} - \\frac{\\lambda}{k_{B}T(1 + a\\sqrt{AI})}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_{0}}{k_{B}T} - \\frac{\\lambda}{k_{B}T(1 + a\\sqrt{AI_{0}})}\\right)$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{d}(I)}{K_{d}(I_{0})}\\right) = -\\frac{\\lambda}{k_{B}T}\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + a\\sqrt{AI}} - \\frac{1}{1 + a\\sqrt{AI_{0}}}\\right)$$\nTo find the explicit expression for $K_{d}(I)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\\frac{K_{d}(I)}{K_{d}(I_{0})} = \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\lambda}{k_{B}T}\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + a\\sqrt{AI}} - \\frac{1}{1 + a\\sqrt{AI_{0}}}\\right)\\right]$$\nFinally, isolating $K_{d}(I)$ yields the desired expression:\n$$K_{d}(I) = K_{d}(I_{0}) \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\lambda}{k_{B}T}\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + a\\sqrt{AI}} - \\frac{1}{1 + a\\sqrt{AI_{0}}}\\right)\\right]$$\nThis expression gives $K_{d}(I)$ in terms of the specified parameters $K_{d}(I_{0})$, $\\lambda$, $a$, $A$, $I$, $I_{0}$, $k_{B}$, and $T$, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.2553 & 0.7447 & K_{d}(I_{0}) \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\lambda}{k_{B}T}\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + a\\sqrt{AI}} - \\frac{1}{1 + a\\sqrt{AI_{0}}}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4600536"}]}
