It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular biology and bioinformatics, specifically concerning mRNA translation and the calculation of the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI). The problem is well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary information and definitions for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem is addressed in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Codon Enumeration, Translation, and Termination Mechanism\n\nThe provided messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) sequence is $5'$-AUGGUGGAAUAA-$3'$. According to the central dogma of molecular biology and the rules specified in the problem, protein synthesis (translation) initiates at the first in-frame AUG codon. The reading frame is the non-overlapping sequence of three-nucleotide codons.\n\n1.  **Codon Enumeration**: We begin parsing the mRNA sequence into codons starting from the $5'$ end. The first codon is AUG.\n    - Codon 1: AUG\n    - Codon 2: GUG\n    - Codon 3: GAA\n    - Codon 4: UAA\n\n2.  **Translation**: Using the Standard Genetic Code, we translate this sequence of codons into a polypeptide chain of amino acids.\n    - The first codon, AUG, is the start codon and codes for the amino acid Methionine (Met). Translation is initiated here.\n    - The second codon, GUG, codes for the amino acid Valine (Val).\n    - The third codon, GAA, codes for the amino acid Glutamic Acid (Glu).\n    - The fourth codon, UAA, is a stop codon. It does not code for an amino acid.\n\n    Therefore, the translated amino acid sequence is Methionine-Valine-Glutamic Acid, which can be abbreviated as Met-Val-Glu.\n\n3.  **Termination Mechanism**: Translation terminates when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (in this case, UAA) in its acceptor site (A-site). Unlike sense codons, stop codons are not recognized by any transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule. Instead, they are recognized by protein factors known as release factors (RFs). The binding of a release factor to the A-site promotes the hydrolysis of the ester bond linking the completed polypeptide chain to the tRNA molecule residing in the peptidyl site (P-site) of the ribosome. This hydrolytic cleavage releases the nascent polypeptide from the ribosome. Subsequently, the ribosomal subunits, mRNA, and the release factor dissociate, completing the process of termination.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI)\n\nThe Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) is defined as the geometric mean of the relative adaptiveness weights ($w_i$) of the sense codons in a coding sequence. The stop codon is explicitly excluded from this calculation.\n\nThe coding sequence consists of $L$ sense codons. From our analysis in Part 1, the sense codons are AUG, GUG, and GAA. Thus, the length $L$ of the sense coding sequence is $3$.\n\nThe given relative adaptiveness weights are:\n- $w_1 = w(\\text{AUG}) = 1.00$\n- $w_2 = w(\\text{GUG}) = 0.80$\n- $w_3 = w(\\text{GAA}) = 0.55$\n\nThe formula for the CAI is the geometric mean of these weights:\n$$ CAI = \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{L} w_i \\right)^{\\frac{1}{L}} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values and $L=3$:\n$$ CAI = (w_1 \\times w_2 \\times w_3)^{\\frac{1}{3}} $$\n$$ CAI = (1.00 \\times 0.80 \\times 0.55)^{\\frac{1}{3}} $$\n\nFirst, we compute the product of the weights:\n$$ \\prod_{i=1}^{3} w_i = 1.00 \\times 0.80 \\times 0.55 = 0.44 $$\n\nNow, we take the cube root of this product to find the geometric mean:\n$$ CAI = (0.44)^{\\frac{1}{3}} $$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ CAI \\approx 0.76059046... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ CAI \\approx 0.7606 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7606}$$", "id": "4568359"}, {"introduction": "While the genetic code is degenerate, the choice among synonymous codons is far from random.
