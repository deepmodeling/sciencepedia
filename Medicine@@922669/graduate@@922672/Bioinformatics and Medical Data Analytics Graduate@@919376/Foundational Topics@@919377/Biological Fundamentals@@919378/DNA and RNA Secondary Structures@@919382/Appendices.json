The rules for RNA secondary structure (canonical and wobble pairing, non-pseudoknotting, minimum loop size) are standard components of well-established models, such as those implemented in the Nussinov or Zuker algorithms.

The sequence, pairing rules, and all constraints are explicitly stated. The question asks for the set of all possible pairs that can exist in any valid structure, which is a well-defined and solvable problem.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free of any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary information (sequence, rules) and the constraints are mutually consistent and standard in the field.\n5.  **Other Flaws**: The problem is not trivial, metaphorical, or ill-structured. It represents a standard exercise in applying the fundamental rules of RNA structure prediction.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe task is to find all index pairs $(i, j)$ with $1 \\le i  j \\le 9$ that satisfy the given conditions. A pair $(i, j)$ is included in the final set if it can be part of at least one valid secondary structure. A secondary structure is a set of base pairs that collectively satisfy all rules.\n\nLet the sequence be denoted by $S$, where $S = S_1 S_2 S_3 S_4 S_5 S_6 S_7 S_8 S_9 = \\mathrm{G}\\mathrm{G}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{U}\\mathrm{U}\\mathrm{G}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nFor a pair $(i, j)$ to be considered, it must satisfy two primary local constraints:\n\n1.  **Chemical Compatibility**: The nucleotides at positions $i$ and $j$, $S_i$ and $S_j$, must be able to form a valid base pair. The allowed pairings are $\\{\\mathrm{G,C}\\}$, $\\{\\mathrm{A,U}\\}$, and $\\{\\mathrm{G,U}\\}$.\n2.  **Steric Constraint (Minimum Loop Size)**: If a pair $(i, j)$ forms a hairpin loop, the loop consists of the nucleotides between them, from position $i+1$ to $j-1$. The number of nucleotides in this loop is $(j-1) - (i+1) + 1 = j-i-1$. The problem states this number must be at least $L_{\\min}=3$. Thus, the constraint is:\n    $$ j - i - 1 \\ge 3 \\implies j - i \\ge 4 $$\n    This is equivalent to the problem's statement that $j-i > 3$.\n\nThe condition \"in at least one non-pseudoknotted secondary structure\" is key. A structure containing just a single pair, $\\{(i,j)\\}$, is a valid non-pseudoknotted structure provided that the pair $(i,j)$ itself satisfies the chemical and steric constraints listed above. The non-pseudoknotting and single-partner rules are trivially satisfied in a single-pair structure. Therefore, our task simplifies to finding all pairs $(i,j)$ that meet the chemical and steric rules.\n\nWe will systematically iterate through all possible values of $i$ and $j$ ($1 \\le i  j \\le 9$) and test them against these two rules.\n\n*   **For $i=1$ ($S_1=\\mathrm{G}$)**: We need $j \\ge 1+4 = 5$.

Unpaired bases are $a=k-i-1=1$ and $b=j-l-1=0$. $INT(1,0)=2.0+0.4(1)=2.4$. Energy is $e_{\\text{GC}}+INT(1,0)+V[3,7] = -3.0+2.4+2.0=1.4$.\n    $V[1,8]=\\min(0.6, -1.3, 1.4) = -1.3$.\n- $V[2,9]$ (G-C):\n    - Hairpin: $e_{\\text{GC}} + HP(6) = -3.0 + 3.6 = 0.6$.\n    - Stacking on $(3,8)$: We have $V[3,8]=0.2$. Energy is $e_{\\text{GC}}(2,9)+s+V[3,8] = -3.0 - 0.5 + 0.2 = -3.3$.\n    - Interior loop with inner pair $(3,7)$: $i=2,j=9,k=3,l=7$. Unpaired bases $a=k-i-1=0, b=j-l-1=1$. Energy is $e_{\\text{GC}}+INT(0,1)+V[3,7] = -3.0+2.4+2.0=1.4$.\n    $V[2,9] = \\min(0.6, -3.3, 1.4) = -3.3$.\n\nNow for $W[i,i+7]$:\n- $W[1,8] = \\min(W[2,8], W[1,7], V[1,8], \\text{bifurcations})$.\n    - $W[2,8]=-1.5$, $W[1,7]=0$, $V[1,8]=-1.3$.\n    - Bifurcation term $\\min_k (W[1,k]+W[k+1,8])$ has a minimum for $k=1$, giving $W[1,1]+W[2,8] = 0 + (-1.5) = -1.5$.\n    - $W[1,8] = \\min(-1.5, 0, -1.3, -1.5) = -1.5$.\n- $W[2,9] = \\min(W[3,9], W[2,8], V[2,9], \\text{bifurcations})$.\n    - $W[3,9]=0$, $W[2,8]=-1.5$, $V[2,9]=-3.3$.\n    - Bifurcation term $\\min_k (W[2,k]+W[k+1,9])$ has a minimum for $k=8$, giving $W[2,8]+W[9,9] = -1.5+0 = -1.5$.\n    - $W[2,9] = \\min(0, -1.5, -3.3, -1.5) = -3.3$.\n\n**Full Sequence, length $l=9$ ($d=j-i=8$)**\n\nWe compute $V[1,9]$ and then the final answer $W[1,9]$. The hairpin loop length is $L=7$. $HP(7)=3.0+0.2(7-3)=3.8$.\n- $V[1,9]$ (G-C):\n    - Hairpin: $e_{\\text{GC}} + HP(7) = -3.0 + 3.8 = 0.8$.\n    - Stacking on $(2,8)$: We have $V[2,8]=-1.5$. Energy is $e_{\\text{GC}}+s+V[2,8] = -3.0 - 0.5 + (-1.5) = -5.0$.\n    - Interior loop with $(3,8)$: $i=1,j=9,k=3,l=8$. Unpaired bases $a=1, b=0$. $INT(1,0)=2.4$. Energy is $e_{\\text{GC}}+INT(1,0)+V[3,8] = -3.0+2.4+0.2 = -0.4$.\n    - Other interior loops give higher energies. For example, with inner pair $(3,7)$: $a=1,b=1$, $INT(1,1)=2.8$, energy is $-3.0+2.8+V[3,7]=2.0$, gives $1.8$.\n    $V[1,9] = \\min(0.8, -5.0, -0.4, \\dots) = -5.0$.\n\nFinally, we compute $W[1,9]$:\n$W[1,9] = \\min(W[2,9], W[1,8], V[1,9], \\min_{k=1}^{8}(W[1,k]+W[k+1,9]))$.\n- $W[2,9] = -3.3$ (base $1$ is unpaired).\n- $W[1,8] = -1.5$ (base $9$ is unpaired).\n- $V[1,9] = -5.0$ (bases $1$ and $9$ form a pair).\n- Bifurcation: The minimum contribution comes from $k=1$, giving $W[1,1]+W[2,9] = 0 + (-3.3) = -3.3$.\nComparing these possibilities:\n$W[1,9] = \\min(-3.3, -1.5, -5.0, -3.3) = -5.0$.\n\nThe minimum free energy is $-5.0$ kcal/mol.\n\n**Final Structure Identification**\n\nThe MFE $W[1,9]$ is equal to $V[1,9]$, which means the optimal structure for the entire sequence is closed by the base pair $(1,9)$.\nThe value $V[1,9]=-5.0$ was obtained from the stacking case: $V[1,9] = e_{\\text{bp}}(1,9)+s+V[2,8]$. This indicates the pair $(1,9)$ stacks upon the helix closed by the pair $(2,8)$.\nThe value $V[2,8]=-1.5$ was also obtained from stacking: $V[2,8] = e_{\\text{bp}}(2,8)+s+V[3,7]$. This indicates the pair $(2,8)$ stacks upon the helix closed by the pair $(3,7)$.\nThe value $V[3,7]=2.0$ was from a hairpin loop: $V[3,7] = e_{\\text{bp}}(3,7)+HP(3)$. This means the pair $(3,7)$ closes a hairpin loop containing the bases $S_4, S_5, S_6$.\nThus, the final base-pairing pattern consists of a single stem of three pairs: $(1,9)$, $(2,8)$, and $(3,7)$. The structure expressed in dot-bracket notation is `(((.)))`.\n\nThe final MFE value is $-5.0$. Rounded to four significant figures, this is $-5.000$ kcal/mol.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-5.000}$$", "id": "4558398"}]}
