Assume that absolute tumor copy numbers have been calibrated against a matched normal so that $C_i$ are integer totals for the tumor clone, independent of normal cell contamination. Consider a simplified autosomal genome of total length $L$ partitioned into $n = 6$ segments with lengths $\\ell_1 = 600$, $\\ell_2 = 450$, $\\ell_3 = 550$, $\\ell_4 = 300$, $\\ell_5 = 800$, and $\\ell_6 = 300$, so that $L = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\ell_i = 3{,}000$.

There are no identifiable flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of Tumor Ploidy ($\\pi$)\nThe problem defines tumor ploidy, $\\pi$, as the genome-wide average absolute copy number per base. The genome is partitioned into $n$ segments, where segment $i$ has length $\\ell_i$ and a constant absolute copy number $C_i$.\n\nThe total number of DNA copies within a single segment $i$ is proportional to its length $\\ell_i$ and its copy number $C_i$. To find the average copy number across the entire genome, we must compute the weighted average of the copy numbers $\\{C_i\\}$, where the weights are the fractional lengths of the segments.\n\nThe total \"copy-weighted\" length of the genome is the sum of the products of each segment's copy number and its length:\n$$\n\\text{Total copy-weighted length} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} C_i \\ell_i\n$$\nThe total length of the genome is $L = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ell_i$.\n\nThe average ploidy $\\pi$ is the ratio of the total copy-weighted length to the total length. Thus, the expression for $\\pi$ is:\n$$\n\\pi = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} C_i \\ell_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ell_i} = \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} C_i \\ell_i\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n$L = 3000$\n$\\{\\ell_i\\} = \\{600, 450, 550, 300, 800, 300\\}$\n$\\{C_i\\} = \\{4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 2\\}$\n\nThe sum in the numerator is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{6} C_i \\ell_i = (4)(600) + (5)(450) + (4)(550) + (3)(300) + (4)(800) + (2)(300)\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{6} C_i \\ell_i = 2400 + 2250 + 2200 + 900 + 3200 + 600 = 11550\n$$\nNow, we can compute $\\pi$:\n$$\n\\pi = \\frac{11550}{3000} = \\frac{11.55}{3} = 3.85\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of Minimal Evolutionary Events ($E^{\\star}$)\nWe need to find the minimum number of events to transform the ancestral diploid state, $C_{\\text{initial}} = \\{2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2\\}$, to the observed final state, $C_{\\text{final}} = \\{4, 5, 4, 3, 4, 2\\}$. We consider two scenarios.\n\n#### Scenario (i): No WGD Allowed\nIn this scenario, only segmental gain and loss events are permitted. The number of events required to change the copy number of a single segment $i$ from $2$ to $C_i$ is simply the absolute difference $|C_i - 2|$. The total number of events, $E_{\\text{no-WGD}}$, is the sum of these differences over all segments:\n$$\nE_{\\text{no-WGD}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |C_i - 2|\n$$\nSubstituting the values for $C_{\\text{final}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{no-WGD}} = |4 - 2| + |5 - 2| + |4 - 2| + |3 - 2| + |4 - 2| + |2 - 2|\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{no-WGD}} = 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 10\n$$\nThe minimum number of events without WGD is $10$.\n\n#### Scenario (ii): One WGD Allowed\nIn this scenario, the evolutionary path involves an intermediate pre-WGD state, $C_{\\text{pre-WGD}} = \\{c'_1, c'_2, \\ldots, c'_n\\}$, which is reached from the initial diploid state via segmental events. This is followed by a single WGD event, and then further segmental events lead to the final state $C_{\\text{final}}$. The total number of events is the sum of pre-WGD segmental events, the single WGD event, and the post-WGD segmental events.\n\nFor each segment $i$, we want to find an integer pre-WGD copy number $c'_i$ that minimizes the number of segmental events. The total number of events for a given $C_{\\text{pre-WGD}}$ is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{WGD}}(C_{\\text{pre-WGD}}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |c'_i - 2| + 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |C_i - 2c'_i|\n$$\nTo find the overall minimum, we can minimize the event count for each segment independently. For each segment $i$, we must find the integer $c'_i \\geq 0$ that minimizes the segmental event count $e_i(c'_i) = |c'_i - 2| + |C_i - 2c'_i|$.\nThe total minimal event count for this scenario will be $E_{\\text{WGD}} = 1 + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\min_{c'_i} e_i(c'_i)$.\n\nLet's compute this for each segment:\n- **Segment 1 ($C_1 = 4$):** Minimize $e_1(c'_1) = |c'_1 - 2| + |4 - 2c'_1|$.\n  - If $c'_1 = 2$: $e_1(2) = |2-2| + |4 - 2(2)| = 0 + 0 = 0$.

Minimum is $0$, for $c'_3 = 2$.\n- **Segment 4 ($C_4 = 3$):** Minimize $e_4(c'_4) = |c'_4 - 2| + |3 - 2c'_4|$.\n  - If $c'_4 = 1$: $e_4(1) = |1-2| + |3 - 2(1)| = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n  - If $c'_4 = 2$: $e_4(2) = |2-2| + |3 - 2(2)| = 0 + 1 = 1$.\n  - The minimum is $1$, for $c'_4 = 2$.\n- **Segment 5 ($C_5 = 4$):** Same as segment 1. Minimum is $0$, for $c'_5 = 2$.\n- **Segment 6 ($C_6 = 2$):** Minimize $e_6(c'_6) = |c'_6 - 2| + |2 - 2c'_6|$.\n  - If $c'_6 = 1$: $e_6(1) = |1-2| + |2 - 2(1)| = 1 + 0 = 1$.\n  - If $c'_6 = 2$: $e_6(2) = |2-2| + |2 - 2(2)| = 0 + 2 = 2$.\n  - The minimum is $1$, for $c'_6 = 1$.\n\nThe optimal pre-WGD state is $C_{\\text{pre-WGD}} = \\{2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1\\}$.\nThe total number of segmental events is the sum of the minimums for each segment:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\min_{c'_i} e_i(c'_i) = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3\n$$\nThe total event count for the WGD scenario is the cost of the WGD event ($1$) plus the total segmental events ($3$):\n$$\nE_{\\text{WGD}} = 1 + 3 = 4\n$$\n\n#### Comparison and Final Minimal Event Count ($E^{\\star}$)\nWe compare the minimal event counts from the two scenarios:\n- Scenario (i) without WGD: $E_{\\text{no-WGD}} = 10$.\n- Scenario (ii) with one WGD: $E_{\\text{WGD}} = 4$.\n\nThe minimal total number of events, $E^{\\star}$, is the smaller of these two values:\n$$\nE^{\\star} = \\min(E_{\\text{no-WGD}}, E_{\\text{WGD}}) = \\min(10, 4) = 4\n$$\n\n### Final Answer\nThe calculated average ploidy is $\\pi = 3.85$.\nThe minimal total number of events is $E^{\\star} = 4$.\nThe problem requests the final answer as a row matrix containing $\\pi$ and $E^{\\star}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 3.85  4 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4616048"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical models are only useful if they can be applied to real data, which is always affected by noise and detection limits.

Calculate the expected log ratio, $E[L]$, for a segment with a single-copy loss.\n3.  Calculate the standard deviation of the log ratio under the null hypothesis, $\\text{SD}(L|_{H_0})$, using the Delta method.\n4.  Establish the detection criterion and solve for the minimum purity, $p_{\\min}$.\n5.  Evaluate $p_{\\min}$ numerically.\n\n**1. Expected Read Counts**\n\nThe expected number of reads in a genomic segment is proportional to its length, the sequencing depth, and its copy number. The baseline expected count for a diploid segment of length $\\ell$ is given as $\\lambda_{diploid} = \\kappa \\ell$.\n\nFor the matched normal sample, the cells are uniformly diploid ($C_{n}=2$). Therefore, the expected read count $E[Y]$ is:\n$$ E[Y] = \\frac{C_n}{2} \\kappa \\ell = \\frac{2}{2} \\kappa \\ell = \\kappa \\ell $$\n\nThe tumor sample is an admixture of normal cells (fraction $1-p$) and tumor cells (fraction $p$). The normal cells have copy number $C_n=2$, and the tumor cells have a heterozygous deletion, $C_t=1$. The average or \"effective\" copy number in the mixed tumor sample, $C_{mix}$, is the weighted average:\n$$ C_{mix} = p \\cdot C_t + (1-p) \\cdot C_n = p \\cdot 1 + (1-p) \\cdot 2 = p + 2 - 2p = 2 - p $$\nThe expected read count in the tumor sample, $E[X]$, is then:\n$$ E[X] = \\frac{C_{mix}}{2} \\kappa \\ell = \\frac{2-p}{2} \\kappa \\ell $$\n\n**2. Expected Log Ratio under Copy Loss**\n\nThe log ratio is $L = \\log_{2}(X/Y)$. For large read counts, the expectation of the log ratio can be approximated by the log ratio of the expectations:\n$$ E[L] \\approx \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{E[X]}{E[Y]}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $E[X]$ and $E[Y]$:\n$$ E[L_{loss}] \\approx \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{\\frac{2-p}{2} \\kappa \\ell}{\\kappa \\ell}\\right) = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{2-p}{2}\\right) = \\log_{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{p}{2}\\right) $$\nSince $p0$, this value is negative, as expected for a copy loss.\n\n**3. Standard Deviation under the Null Hypothesis**\n\nThe null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that there is no copy number alteration, meaning the tumor cells are also diploid in this segment ($C_t=2$). Under $H_0$, the effective copy number in the tumor sample is $C_{mix,0} = p \\cdot 2 + (1-p) \\cdot 2 = 2$.\nThus, under $H_0$:\n$$ E[X|_{H_0}] = \\frac{2}{2} \\kappa \\ell = \\kappa \\ell $$\n$$ E[Y] = \\kappa \\ell $$\nLet $\\mu_0 = \\kappa \\ell$. Under $H_0$, $E[X] = E[Y] = \\mu_0$. The read counts $X$ and $Y$ are modeled as independent Poisson random variables, so $\\text{Var}(X) = E[X] = \\mu_0$ and $\\text{Var}(Y) = E[Y] = \\mu_0$.\n\nWe use the Delta method to find the variance of $L = f(X, Y) = \\log_{2}(X/Y) = \\frac{\\ln(X) - \\ln(Y)}{\\ln(2)}$.\nThe first-order Taylor expansion for the variance is:\n$$ \\text{Var}(L) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(X) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial Y}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(Y) + 2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial Y}\\right) \\text{Cov}(X, Y) $$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X} = \\frac{1}{X \\ln(2)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial Y} = -\\frac{1}{Y \\ln(2)} $$\nEvaluating these at the expected values under $H_0$ ($X=Y=\\mu_0$):\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X}\\right|_{\\mu_0} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\ln(2)} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\left.\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial Y}\\right|_{\\mu_0} = -\\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\ln(2)} $$\nSince the tumor and normal samples are sequenced independently, $\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = 0$.\nThe variance of $L$ under $H_0$ is:\n$$ \\text{Var}(L|_{H_0}) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\ln(2)}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(X|_{H_0}) + \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\ln(2)}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(Y) $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(L|_{H_0}) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_0^2 (\\ln(2))^2}\\right) \\mu_0 + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\mu_0^2 (\\ln(2))^2}\\right) \\mu_0 = \\frac{2\\mu_0}{\\mu_0^2 (\\ln(2))^2} = \\frac{2}{\\mu_0 (\\ln(2))^2} $$\nThe standard deviation under $H_0$ is the square root of the variance:\n$$ \\text{SD}(L|_{H_0}) = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(L|_{H_0})} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\mu_0 (\\ln(2))^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\ln(2)\\sqrt{\\mu_0}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\ln(2)\\sqrt{\\kappa \\ell}} $$\n\n**4. Solving for Minimum Purity ($p_{\\min}$)**\n\nA detection is made if the signal magnitude exceeds $z$ standard deviations of the null distribution. The signal is the expected log ratio for the copy loss. We find the minimum purity $p_{\\min}$ by setting the signal equal to the detection threshold:\n$$ |E[L_{loss}]| = z \\cdot \\text{SD}(L|_{H_0}) $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$ \\left| \\log_{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{p_{\\min}}{2}\\right) \\right| = z \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\ln(2)\\sqrt{\\kappa \\ell}} $$\nSince $0  p_{\\min} \\le 1$, the argument of the logarithm is less than $1$, making the logarithm negative.

The problem is therefore deemed valid, and a solution is provided below.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the expected alternate allele probability $q$**\n\nThe expected alternate allele probability, denoted as $q$, is the ratio of the total number of alternate (mutated) allele copies to the total number of all allele copies across the entire cell population in the sample. The sample is a mixture of normal cells and tumor cells.\n\nLet $p$ be the fraction of tumor cells (purity) and $1-p$ be the fraction of normal cells.\nLet's account for the number of alleles contributed by each cell type in a representative portion of the tissue.\n\n- **Normal Cells:**\n  - Constitute a fraction $1-p$ of the cells.\n  - Each normal cell has a copy number of $2$ at the locus.\n  - Normal cells do not carry the somatic mutation, so they have $0$ alternate allele copies.\n  - The number of total alleles contributed by the normal cell fraction is proportional to $(1-p) \\times 2$.\n\n- **Tumor Cells:**\n  - Constitute a fraction $p$ of the cells.\n  - A sub-fraction $f$ of these tumor cells carries the mutation, while a fraction $1-f$ does not.\n  - All tumor cells, regardless of mutation status, have a total copy number of $C$ at the locus.\n  - For the sub-fraction $p \\times f$ of mutation-carrying tumor cells, each cell has $m$ alternate allele copies.\n  - For the sub-fraction $p \\times (1-f)$ of non-mutation-carrying tumor cells, each cell has $0$ alternate allele copies.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of alternate allele copies and the total number of all allele copies by summing the contributions from each subpopulation, weighted by their respective fractions.\n\nThe total number of alternate allele copies, $N_{\\text{alt}}$, is proportional to:\n$$N_{\\text{alt}} = \\underbrace{(1-p) \\times 0}_{\\text{Normal}} + \\underbrace{(p \\times f) \\times m}_{\\text{Mutated Tumor}} + \\underbrace{p \\times (1-f) \\times 0}_{\\text{Non-mutated Tumor}} = pfm$$\n\nThe total number of all allele copies, $N_{\\text{total}}$, is proportional to:\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = \\underbrace{(1-p) \\times 2}_{\\text{Normal}} + \\underbrace{p \\times C}_{\\text{All Tumor}} = 2(1-p) + pC$$\n\nThe expected alternate allele probability $q$ is the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$q(p, f, m, C) = \\frac{N_{\\text{alt}}}{N_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{pfm}{2(1-p) + pC}$$\n\nThis is the derived general formula for the expected VAF.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of expected VAF for Model A and Model B**\n\nWe are given the parameters for two models.\n\n- **Model A:** $(p_A, f_A, m_A, C_A) = (0.7, 1, 2, 3)$.\n  The expected VAF, $q_A$, is:\n  $$q_A = \\frac{0.7 \\times 1 \\times 2}{2(1 - 0.7) + 0.7 \\times 3} = \\frac{1.4}{2(0.3) + 2.1} = \\frac{1.4}{0.6 + 2.1} = \\frac{1.4}{2.7} = \\frac{14}{27}$$\n  As a decimal, $q_A \\approx 0.5185$.\n\n- **Model B:** $(p_B, f_B, m_B, C_B) = (0.5, 1, 2, 2)$.\n  The expected VAF, $q_B$, is:\n  $$q_B = \\frac{0.5 \\times 1 \\times 2}{2(1 - 0.5) + 0.5 \\times 2} = \\frac{1}{2(0.5) + 1} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n  As a decimal, $q_B = 0.5$.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the log-likelihood ratio (LLR)**\n\nThe number of alternate reads $k$ out of a total read depth $n$ is modeled by a Binomial distribution with success probability $q$: $k \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, q)$. The probability mass function is $P(k|n,q) = \\binom{n}{k} q^k (1-q)^{n-k}$.\n\nThe likelihood function $\\mathcal{L}$ is equal to this probability. The natural log-likelihood $\\ln \\mathcal{L}$ is:\n$$\\ln \\mathcal{L}(q | k, n) = \\ln \\left( \\binom{n}{k} q^k (1-q)^{n-k} \\right) = \\ln\\binom{n}{k} + k\\ln(q) + (n-k)\\ln(1-q)$$\n\nWe are given the observed data: $n=200$ and $k=132$. Therefore, $n-k = 200 - 132 = 68$.\n\nFor Model A, with $q_A = 14/27$:\n$$\\ln \\mathcal{L}_A = \\ln\\binom{200}{132} + 132\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{27}\\right) + 68\\ln\\left(1-\\frac{14}{27}\\right)$$\n$$\\ln \\mathcal{L}_A = \\ln\\binom{200}{132} + 132\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{27}\\right) + 68\\ln\\left(\\frac{13}{27}\\right)$$\n\nFor Model B, with $q_B = 1/2$:\n$$\\ln \\mathcal{L}_B = \\ln\\binom{200}{132} + 132\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + 68\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n$$\\ln \\mathcal{L}_B = \\ln\\binom{200}{132} + (132+68)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\ln\\binom{200}{132} + 200\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n\nThe natural log-likelihood ratio is $\\mathrm{LLR} = \\ln \\mathcal{L}_A - \\ln \\mathcal{L}_B$.\n$$\\mathrm{LLR} = \\left( \\ln\\binom{200}{132} + 132\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{27}\\right) + 68\\ln\\left(\\frac{13}{27}\\right) \\right) - \\left( \\ln\\binom{200}{132} + 200\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right)$$\nThe binomial coefficient term cancels out:\n$$\\mathrm{LLR} = 132\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{27}\\right) + 68\\ln\\left(\\frac{13}{27}\\right) - 200\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n$$\\mathrm{LLR} = 132\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{27}\\right) + 68\\ln\\left(\\frac{13}{27}\\right) + 200\\ln(2)$$\nWe can regroup the terms for a simpler calculation:\n$$\\mathrm{LLR} = 132\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{14}{27}\\right) + \\ln(2)\\right) + 68\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{13}{27}\\right) + \\ln(2)\\right)$$\n$$\\mathrm{LLR} = 132\\ln\\left(\\frac{14 \\times 2}{27}\\right) + 68\\ln\\left(\\frac{13 \\times 2}{27}\\right)$$\n$$\\mathrm{LLR} = 132\\ln\\left(\\frac{28}{27}\\right) + 68\\ln\\left(\\frac{26}{27}\\right)$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{28}{27}\\right) \\approx \\ln(1.037037) \\approx 0.0363678$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{26}{27}\\right) \\approx \\ln(0.962963) \\approx -0.0377396$$\n$$\\mathrm{LLR} \\approx 132 \\times (0.0363678) + 68 \\times (-0.0377396)$$\n$$\\mathrm{LLR} \\approx 4.80055 - 2.56629 \\approx 2.23426$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the log-likelihood ratio is $2.234$.\nThe positive value indicates that the observed data are more likely under Model A than Model B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.234}$$", "id": "4616113"}]}
