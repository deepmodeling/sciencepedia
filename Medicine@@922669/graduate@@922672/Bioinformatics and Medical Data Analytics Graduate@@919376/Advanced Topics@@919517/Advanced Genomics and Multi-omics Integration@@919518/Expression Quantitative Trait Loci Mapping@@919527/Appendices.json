A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the fraction of expression variance explained by genotype, $R^2$, and then to compute its numerical value.\n\nThe fraction of variance explained, $R^2$, is defined as the ratio of the variance explained by the model's predictor variable (genotype $g$) to the total variance of the outcome variable (expression $y$).\n$$\nR^2 = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\text{explained}}}{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\text{E}[y|g])}{\\mathrm{Var}(y)}\n$$\n\nAs stipulated, we begin with the law of total variance:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(y) = \\mathrm{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(y|g)] + \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathrm{E}[y|g])\n$$\nThis partitions the total variance of $y$ into two components: the expected value of the conditional variance (residual variance) and the variance of the conditional expectation (explained variance).\n\nWe use the given linear model, $y = \\alpha + \\beta g + \\varepsilon$, to determine these components.\nFirst, we find the conditional expectation of $y$ given $g$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{E}[y|g] = \\mathrm{E}[\\alpha + \\beta g + \\varepsilon | g]\n$$\nSince $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are constants, and $g$ is known in the conditioning, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{E}[y|g] = \\alpha + \\beta g + \\mathrm{E}[\\varepsilon|g]\n$$\nThe problem states that the residual $\\varepsilon$ is independent of $g$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{E}[\\varepsilon|g] = \\mathrm{E}[\\varepsilon]$. In an OLS framework, it is assumed that $\\mathrm{E}[\\varepsilon]=0$. Thus, the conditional expectation is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{E}[y|g] = \\alpha + \\beta g\n$$\nThis term represents the part of the expression level that is predicted by the genotype.\n\nNext, we find the variance of this conditional expectation, which is the variance explained by the genotype:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathrm{E}[y|g]) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\alpha + \\beta g)\n$$\nSince $\\alpha$ is a constant, it does not contribute to the variance. The variance property $\\mathrm{Var}(cX) = c^2\\mathrm{Var}(X)$ gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathrm{E}[y|g]) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\beta g) = \\beta^2 \\mathrm{Var}(g)\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) and the genotype dosage $g$ can be treated as a binomial random variable with $n=2$ trials (for a diploid organism) and success probability $p$ (the minor allele frequency). The variance of a binomial random variable is given by $np(1-p)$.\nTherefore, the variance of the genotype dosage is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(g) = 2p(1-p)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the explained variance yields:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathrm{E}[y|g]) = \\beta^2 [2p(1-p)] = 2p(1-p)\\beta^2\n$$\n\nNow we return to the definition of $R^2$. We have the expression for the explained variance, and the total variance $\\mathrm{Var}(y)$ is given.\nThe analytical expression for the fraction of variance explained by genotype is:\n$$\nR^2 = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathrm{E}[y|g])}{\\mathrm{Var}(y)} = \\frac{2p(1-p)\\beta^2}{\\mathrm{Var}(y)}\n$$\nThis is the required general formula in terms of $\\beta$, $p$, and $\\mathrm{Var}(y)$.\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression:\n- $\\beta = 0.3$\n- $p = 0.25$\n- $\\mathrm{Var}(y) = 0.8$\n\nFirst, calculate the variance of the genotype, $\\mathrm{Var}(g)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(g) = 2p(1-p) = 2(0.25)(1-0.25) = 2(0.25)(0.75) = 0.5(0.75) = 0.375\n$$\nNext, calculate the variance explained by the genotype:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\mathrm{E}[y|g]) = \\beta^2 \\mathrm{Var}(g) = (0.3)^2 \\times 0.375 = 0.09 \\times 0.375 = 0.03375\n$$\nFinally, calculate $R^2$:\n$$\nR^2 = \\frac{0.03375}{\\mathrm{Var}(y)} = \\frac{0.03375}{0.8} = 0.0421875\n$$\nThe problem asks to round the answer to three significant figures. The first significant figure is $4$, the second is $2$, and the third is $1$. The following digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the third significant digit.\n$$\nR^2 \\approx 0.0422\n$$\n\nThis value, representing $4.22\\%$ of the variance in gene expression explained by a single genetic variant, is a plausible and commonly observed effect size for a strong cis-eQTL. In large-scale studies like the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, it is typical for the most significant cis-eQTL for a given gene (the \"eGene\") to explain between $1\\%$ and $20\\%$ of the expression variance, with some exceptional cases exceeding $50\\%$.

A full derivation and evaluation of the options may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Core Relationships\n\nWe will use population-level quantities, which correspond to the large-sample behavior of their sample-based estimators. The analysis relies on the laws of total expectation, variance, and covariance.\n\n1.  **Relationship between $\\operatorname{Var}(G)$, $\\operatorname{Var}(D)$, and $\\mathbb{E}[v_i]$**:\n    The law of total variance states that for random variables $X$ and $Z$, $\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[X \\mid Z]) + \\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(X \\mid Z)]$.\n    Let $X=G$ and $Z=\\mathcal{I}$. The quantities in the problem are defined based on conditioning on $\\mathcal{I}_i$ for each individual $i$. We can think of these as population-level expectations over the distribution of individuals and their imputation information $\\mathcal{I}$.\n    -   By definition, $\\mathbb{E}[G \\mid \\mathcal{I}] = D$. Thus, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[G \\mid \\mathcal{I}]) = \\operatorname{Var}(D)$.\n    -   By definition, $\\operatorname{Var}(G \\mid \\mathcal{I}) = v$. Thus, $\\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Var}(G \\mid \\mathcal{I})] = \\mathbb{E}[v_i]$ (taking the expectation over all individuals).\n    -   Substituting these into the law of total variance gives the fundamental equation:\n        $$ \\operatorname{Var}(G) = \\operatorname{Var}(D) + \\mathbb{E}[v_i] $$\n    This shows that the variance of the imputed dosages is always less than or equal to the variance of the true genotypes: $\\operatorname{Var}(D) = \\operatorname{Var}(G) - \\mathbb{E}[v_i] \\le \\operatorname{Var}(G)$.\n\n2.  **OLS Estimator for $\\beta$**:\n    The analyst regresses $Y$ on $D$. The population OLS slope for this regression is $\\beta_D = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(Y, D)}{\\operatorname{Var}(D)}$. This is the value to which the OLS estimator $\\hat{\\beta}_D$ converges in large samples.\n    -   Let's analyze the covariance term: $\\operatorname{Cov}(Y, D) = \\operatorname{Cov}(\\alpha + \\beta G + \\varepsilon, D) = \\beta \\operatorname{Cov}(G, D) + \\operatorname{Cov}(\\varepsilon, D)$.\n    -   The non-genetic residual $\\varepsilon$ is independent of the genetic imputation process, so $\\operatorname{Cov}(\\varepsilon, D) = 0$.\n    -   Now, we analyze $\\operatorname{Cov}(G, D)$ using the law of total covariance: $\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = \\mathbb{E}[\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y|Z)] + \\operatorname{Cov}(\\mathbb{E}[X|Z], \\mathbb{E}[Y|Z])$.\n    -   Let $X=G, Y=D, Z=\\mathcal{I}$.\n    -   $\\mathbb{E}[G \\mid \\mathcal{I}]=D$. Since $D$ is a function of $\\mathcal{I}$, it is \"constant\" when conditioned on $\\mathcal{I}$, so $\\mathbb{E}[D \\mid \\mathcal{I}] = D$ and $\\operatorname{Cov}(G, D \\mid \\mathcal{I}) = 0$.\n    -   Therefore, $\\operatorname{Cov}(G, D) = \\operatorname{Cov}(\\mathbb{E}[G \\mid \\mathcal{I}], \\mathbb{E}[D \\mid \\mathcal{I}]) = \\operatorname{Cov}(D, D) = \\operatorname{Var}(D)$.\n    -   Substituting this back into the expression for $\\beta_D$:\n        $$ \\beta_D = \\frac{\\beta \\operatorname{Cov}(G, D)}{\\operatorname{Var}(D)} = \\frac{\\beta \\operatorname{Var}(D)}{\\operatorname{Var}(D)} = \\beta $$\n    This demonstrates that the OLS estimator of the slope, when regressing on imputed dosages defined as conditional expectations, is **unbiased** for the true effect size $\\beta$. This type of model, where $D_i = \\mathbb{E}[G_i | \\mathcal{I}_i]$, is known as a Berkson error model.\n\n3.  **Imputation Quality $R^2$**:\n    The standard measure of imputation quality, denoted $R^2$, is the squared correlation between the true genotype $G$ and the imputed dosage $D$.\n    $$ R^2 = (\\operatorname{Corr}(G, D))^2 = \\frac{(\\operatorname{Cov}(G, D))^2}{\\operatorname{Var}(G) \\operatorname{Var}(D)} $$\n    -   Using our previous result that $\\operatorname{Cov}(G, D) = \\operatorname{Var}(D)$:\n        $$ R^2 = \\frac{(\\operatorname{Var}(D))^2}{\\operatorname{Var}(G) \\operatorname{Var}(D)} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(D)}{\\operatorname{Var}(G)} $$\n    -   This confirms that $R^2$ is the fraction of true genotype variance captured by the imputed dosages.\n    -   Using $\\operatorname{Var}(D) = \\operatorname{Var}(G) - \\mathbb{E}[v_i]$ and the problem's given $\\operatorname{Var}(G) = 2p(1-p)$:\n        $$ R^2 = \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(G) - \\mathbb{E}[v_i]}{\\operatorname{Var}(G)} = 1 - \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[v_i]}{\\operatorname{Var}(G)} = 1 - \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[v_i]}{2p(1-p)} $$\n\n4.  **Wald ($Z$) Statistic and Power**:\n    The Wald statistic for testing $H_0: \\beta=0$ is $Z = \\hat{\\beta} / \\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta})$. Power is determined by the non-centrality parameter of the test, which for large $n$ is $\\lambda = \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\beta}] / \\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta})$.\n    -   **With true genotypes ($G$)**: The estimator $\\hat{\\beta}_G$ is unbiased for $\\beta$. The standard error is $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_G) \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n \\operatorname{Var}(G)}}$. The squared non-centrality parameter is:\n        $$ \\lambda_G^2 = \\frac{\\beta^2}{\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_G)} \\approx \\frac{n \\beta^2 \\operatorname{Var}(G)}{\\sigma^2} $$\n    -   **With imputed dosages ($D$)**: The estimator $\\hat{\\beta}_D$ is also unbiased for $\\beta$. The standard error used for testing $H_0$ is estimated under the null hypothesis $\\beta=0$. In the fitted model $Y_i = \\alpha + \\beta D_i + u_i$, the error variance under the null is simply $\\operatorname{Var}(\\varepsilon_i)=\\sigma^2$. The predictor variance is $\\operatorname{Var}(D)$. So, the standard error is $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_D) \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n \\operatorname{Var}(D)}}$. The squared non-centrality parameter is:\n        $$ \\lambda_D^2 = \\frac{\\beta^2}{\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_D)} \\approx \\frac{n \\beta^2 \\operatorname{Var}(D)}{\\sigma^2} $$\n    -   **Comparison**: Let's find the ratio of the non-centrality parameters.\n        $$ \\frac{\\lambda_D}{\\lambda_G} = \\sqrt{\\frac{n \\beta^2 \\operatorname{Var}(D) / \\sigma^2}{n \\beta^2 \\operatorname{Var}(G) / \\sigma^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(D)}{\\operatorname{Var}(G)}} = \\sqrt{R^2} $$\n    The expected value of the $Z$-statistic under the alternative hypothesis (i.e., its non-centrality) is attenuated by a factor of $\\sqrt{R^2}$. The test statistic's variance under the null is still $1$, but its mean under the alternative is shifted less, leading to a loss of power.\n    -   **Effective Sample Size ($n_{\\text{eff}}$)**: We can see how power is lost by rewriting $\\lambda_D^2$:\n        $$ \\lambda_D^2 = \\frac{n \\beta^2 (R^2 \\operatorname{Var}(G))}{\\sigma^2} = \\frac{(n R^2) \\beta^2 \\operatorname{Var}(G)}{\\sigma^2} $$\n    This shows that a study of size $n$ using dosages has the same power (non-centrality parameter) as a study of size $n_{\\text{eff}} = n R^2$ using true genotypes.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In OLS of $Y$ on $D$, the slope estimator for $\\beta$ is unbiased. Relative to using true genotypes, the expected Wald or $Z$-statistic for testing $H_0:\\beta=0$ is attenuated by a factor $\\sqrt{R^2}$, where $R^2 = 1 - \\mathbb{E}[v_i]/(2p(1-p))$.**\n-   **Unbiased estimator**: As derived in section 2, the OLS estimator $\\hat{\\beta}_D$ is asymptotically unbiased for $\\beta$. **Correct**.\n-   **Z-statistic attenuation**: As derived in section 4, the non-centrality parameter of the Z-statistic is attenuated by $\\sqrt{R^2}$. This corresponds to the attenuation of the expected statistic. **Correct**.\n-   **$R^2$ formula**: As derived in section 3, $R^2 = 1 - \\mathbb{E}[v_i]/\\operatorname{Var}(G) = 1 - \\mathbb{E}[v_i]/(2p(1-p))$. **Correct**.\nAll parts of the statement are consistent with our derivations.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Modeling dosage uncertainty as $D_i = G_i + \\epsilon_i$ with $\\operatorname{Var}(\\epsilon_i) = v_i$ implies $\\operatorname{Var}(D) = \\operatorname{Var}(G) + \\mathbb{E}[v_i]$, so imputation uncertainty inflates the predictor variance and therefore increases power.**\n-   The relationship $\\operatorname{Var}(D) = \\operatorname{Var}(G) + \\mathbb{E}[v_i]$ is incorrect. Our derivation from the law of total variance shows $\\operatorname{Var}(G) = \\operatorname{Var}(D) + \\mathbb{E}[v_i]$, which implies $\\operatorname{Var}(D) = \\operatorname{Var}(G) - \\mathbb{E}[v_i]$. Imputation uncertainty *reduces* the predictor variance.\n-   Because predictor variance is reduced, power is *decreased*, not increased. The statement's premise and conclusion are both flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The imputation quality metric $R^2$ equals $\\operatorname{Corr}(D,G)$ (not squared), and the association $Z$-statistic is reduced by a factor $R^2$.**\n-   The metric $R^2$ is the *squared* correlation. From section 3, we showed $\\operatorname{Corr}(D,G) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(D)}{\\operatorname{Var}(G)}} = \\sqrt{R^2}$. So the statement that $R^2 = \\operatorname{Corr}(D,G)$ is false, unless $R^2=1$ or $R^2=0$.\n-   The association $Z$-statistic is attenuated by a factor of $\\sqrt{R^2}$, not $R^2$. The chi-squared statistic, $Z^2$, is attenuated by a factor of $R^2$. Both claims are false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Filtering variants by an $R^2$ threshold necessarily biases effect estimates toward zero because retained variants have $\\operatorname{Var}(D) < \\operatorname{Var}(G)$.**\n-   As shown in section 2, the OLS estimator for $\\beta$ is unbiased, irrespective of the value of $R^2$ (as long as $R^2>0$). Filtering on $R^2$ does not introduce bias into the effect estimate itself. This is different from filtering on statistical significance (p-value), which can cause winner's curse bias.\n-   While the premise \"retained variants have $\\operatorname{Var}(D) < \\operatorname{Var}(G)$\" is true for any imperfectly imputed variant, it is the cause of power loss, not bias in $\\hat{\\beta}$. The conclusion is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. By the law of total variance, $\\operatorname{Var}(G) = \\operatorname{Var}(D) + \\mathbb{E}[v_i]$, which implies $R^2 = \\operatorname{Var}(D)/\\operatorname{Var}(G)$; therefore, tests using dosages have an effective sample size $n_{\\text{eff}} = R^2 n$.**\n-   The variance decomposition $\\operatorname{Var}(G) = \\operatorname{Var}(D) + \\mathbb{E}[v_i]$ is a direct application of the law of total variance, as shown in section 1. **Correct**.\n-   The implication $R^2 = \\operatorname{Var}(D)/\\operatorname{Var(G)}$ is the standard definition of imputation $R^2$ and follows from the definition of correlation and our derived property $\\operatorname{Cov}(G,D)=\\operatorname{Var}(D)$, as shown in section 3. **Correct**.\n-   The effective sample size $n_{\\text{eff}} = R^2 n$ is a direct consequence of the effect of imputation on the non-centrality parameter of the test statistic, as shown in section 4. **Correct**.\nAll parts of the statement are correct and logically connected.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**F. Because $R^2$ quantifies the fraction of genotype variance captured by dosages, a principled practice is to filter variants with low $R^2$ (for example, below $0.3$ in large samples or below $0.8$ for rare variants), since they contribute $n_{\\text{eff}} \\approx R^2 n$ and have limited power without improving inference quality.**\n-   The statement correctly identifies $R^2$ as the fraction of variance captured ($R^2 = \\operatorname{Var}(D)/\\operatorname{Var}(G)$).\n-   It correctly states that the effective sample size is approximately $R^2 n$.\n-   Based on this mathematical fact, it concludes that variants with very low $R^2$ have severely limited power. For example, a variant with $R^2=0.1$ has only $10\\%$ of the effective sample size of a perfectly genotyped variant.\n-   Therefore, filtering such variants is a logical, \"principled\" strategy to avoid wasting statistical power on the multiple testing burden they impose while offering little information. The given thresholds are illustrative of this principle.

Let $G_i \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$ be the genotype dosage for a single biallelic variant for individual $i$, let $L_i > 0$ denote the library size (sequencing depth) for individual $i$, and let $Y_i \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots\\}$ be the observed read count for the gene. Suppose that the data generating process for $Y_i$ is governed by two well-tested base facts: (i) transcript counts arise by sampling molecules, which under homogeneous sampling are approximately Poisson with mean proportional to true abundance and library size, and (ii) biological overdispersion relative to Poisson sampling can be captured by a Negative Binomial distribution. Further suppose many observations are zero due to a mixture of biological absence and technical sensitivity limits, leading to zero inflation.\n\nModel this by a two-component mixture: with probability $\\pi_i \\in (0,1)$, $Y_i = 0$; otherwise, $Y_i \\sim \\mathrm{NB}(\\mu_i,\\kappa)$, where $\\mathrm{NB}(\\mu,\\kappa)$ denotes a Negative Binomial with mean $\\mu$ and dispersion parameter $\\kappa>0$.

An analyst, unaware of zero inflation, considers two naive strategies commonly seen in practice: (a) fit a standard Negative Binomial generalized linear model (GLM) for $Y_i$ with log link and offset $\\log L_i$, ignoring $\\pi_i$, and (b) log-transform counts as $\\log(1+Y_i)$ and fit a homoscedastic Gaussian linear regression on $G_i$.\n\nStarting from the base sampling model (Poisson sampling leading to Negative Binomial through overdispersion, and mixture-induced zero inflation by sensitivity limits), reason about how zero inflation affects eQTL detection, focusing on bias, variance, power, and calibration of type I error under the naive strategies when $\\pi_i$ is large and may vary with $G_i$. Then, propose statistically principled modeling strategies that directly address zero inflation while preserving genotype effect interpretability on abundance and controlling for library size and batch effects.\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct?\n\nA. When many observations are zero, zero inflation reduces power to detect genotype effects and can induce spurious associations if $\\pi_i$ varies with $G_i$ or correlates with $G_i$ via confounders; a principled remedy is a two-part (hurdle) model that regresses $G_i$ on the zero indicator via a logistic link and on positive counts via a Negative Binomial mean, including an offset $\\log L_i$ and random effects for batch.\n\nB. Zero inflation primarily causes upward bias in the estimated genotype effect under the log-normal regression on $\\log(1+Y_i)$, thereby increasing power while maintaining valid type I error; the most effective strategy is to drop all samples with $Y_i=0$.\n\nC. A standard Negative Binomial GLM for $Y_i$ with a fixed dispersion and the addition of a small pseudocount before log-transform completely resolves zero inflation; there is no need to explicitly model the zero probability $\\pi_i$.\n\nD. When zeros are driven by a detection limit rather than a structural absence, they can be represented as censoring at a threshold; a censored (Tobit) regression on log-abundance with genotype effects and sample-level random intercepts can improve calibration relative to naive Gaussian regression, especially when combined with an offset for $\\log L_i$.\n\nE. Rank-based eQTL tests using Spearman correlation on transcripts per million (TPM) and ignoring library size offsets are automatically robust to zero inflation and maximize power in the presence of many zeros.\n\nSelect all that apply.", "solution": "We begin from the base facts: RNA-seq counts can be modeled by Poisson sampling of molecules, with biological overdispersion captured by a Negative Binomial (NB). When many observed counts are zero due to detection limits or true absence, a mixture model introduces zero inflation: with probability $\\pi_i$, $Y_i=0$, and with probability $1-\\pi_i$, $Y_i \\sim \\mathrm{NB}(\\mu_i,\\kappa)$, where the mean $\\mu_i$ scales with library size $L_i$ and true abundance. Genotype effects enter the log-mean abundance via $\\log \\mu_i = \\alpha + \\beta G_i + \\log L_i$. The zero probability $\\pi_i$ may depend on sensitivity, composition, and potentially on $G_i$ through confounding (for example, if $G_i$ correlates with cell type composition that influences detection).\n\nImpact of zero inflation on naive models:\n\n- Expectation and variance under the mixture: \n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y_i \\mid G_i] \\;=\\; (1-\\pi_i)\\mu_i,\\quad \n\\mathrm{Var}(Y_i \\mid G_i) \\;=\\; (1-\\pi_i)\\left(\\mu_i + \\frac{\\mu_i^2}{\\kappa}\\right) + \\pi_i(1-\\pi_i)\\mu_i^2.\n$$\nRelative to a pure NB with mean $\\mu_i$, zero inflation reduces the mean to $(1-\\pi_i)\\mu_i$ and inflates variance by the term $\\pi_i(1-\\pi_i)\\mu_i^2$. If $\\pi_i$ is large, the variance can be substantially inflated.\n\n- Naive NB GLM ignoring zero inflation: Fitting $Y_i \\sim \\mathrm{NB}(\\tilde\\mu_i,\\tilde\\kappa)$ with $\\log \\tilde\\mu_i = \\tilde\\alpha + \\tilde\\beta G_i + \\log L_i$ forces extra zeros to be explained by dispersion $\\tilde\\kappa$ or by a smaller mean. In the Kullback–Leibler sense, the pseudo-true parameters satisfy\n$$\n\\tilde\\mu_i \\approx (1-\\pi_i)\\mu_i,\n$$\nup to adjustments absorbed by $\\tilde\\kappa$. If $\\pi_i$ varies across $G_i$, then $\\log \\tilde\\mu_i \\approx \\alpha + \\beta G_i + \\log L_i + \\log(1-\\pi_i)$, so the regression slope with respect to $G_i$ becomes $\\beta + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial G_i}\\log(1-\\pi_i)$, conflating abundance effects with zero-probability effects. Even when $\\pi_i$ is constant, the effective mean is attenuated by $(1-\\pi_i)$, which reduces signal strength and hence power. If $\\pi_i$ correlates with $G_i$ due to confounders (for example, batch or cell composition), the naive NB GLM can exhibit spurious associations because $\\log(1-\\pi_i)$ varies with $G_i$.\n\n- Naive Gaussian regression on $\\log(1+Y_i)$: Let $T_i=\\log(1+Y_i)$. Under the mixture,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[T_i \\mid G_i] \\;=\\; \\pi_i\\log(1+0) + (1-\\pi_i)\\,\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\log(1+Y_i) \\mid Y_i \\sim \\mathrm{NB}(\\mu_i,\\kappa)\\big] \\;=\\; (1-\\pi_i)\\,\\mathbb{E}\\big[\\log(1+Y_i)\\big].\n$$\nA delta-method approximation yields\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\log(1+Y_i)] \\approx \\log(1+\\mu_i) - \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(Y_i)}{2(1+\\mu_i)^2}\n$$\nwhen the NB variance is moderate. Differentiating with respect to $G_i$,\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial G_i}\\,\\mathbb{E}[T_i \\mid G_i] \\;\\approx\\; (1-\\pi_i)\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial G_i}\\log(1+\\mu_i) \\;+\\; \\text{terms from variance} \\;-\\; \\Big(\\frac{\\partial \\pi_i}{\\partial G_i}\\Big)\\,\\mathbb{E}[\\log(1+Y_i)].\n$$\nIf $\\pi_i$ is constant, the slope is scaled by $(1-\\pi_i)$ relative to the ideal log-scale slope, yielding attenuation. In addition, heteroscedasticity arises because the variance of $T_i$ depends on $\\mu_i$ and $\\pi_i$; ordinary least squares with homoscedastic errors produces mis-calibrated standard errors. If $\\frac{\\partial \\pi_i}{\\partial G_i} \\neq 0$, the second term can induce apparent genotype effects even when $\\beta=0$, causing type I error inflation. Dropping all zeros (restricting to $Y_i>0$) changes the estimand to the conditional mean among positives and introduces selection bias if positivity depends on $G_i$ or confounders; it also reduces sample size and discards information about the zero mechanism.\n\nPrincipled modeling strategies that follow from the base process:\n\n- Two-part hurdle model: Let $Z_i = \\mathbb{I}\\{Y_i>0\\}$. Model\n$$\n\\mathrm{logit}\\,\\Pr(Z_i = 1 \\mid G_i, L_i, \\text{batch}) \\;=\\; \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1 G_i + \\delta^\\top \\text{batch}_i + \\eta \\log L_i,\n$$\nand, conditional on $Z_i=1$, model $Y_i \\mid Z_i=1 \\sim \\mathrm{NB}(\\mu_i,\\kappa)$ with\n$$\n\\log \\mu_i \\;=\\; \\alpha + \\beta G_i + \\log L_i + b_i,\n$$\nwhere $b_i$ is a random intercept for batch or sample effects. This separates the zero-generating mechanism from the abundance among positives, avoids conflation of $\\beta$ with $\\pi_i$, and properly accounts for $\\log L_i$ via an offset. Testing genotype effects can be performed on $\\gamma_1$ (presence/absence) and on $\\beta$ (abundance), with multiple-testing control across genes and variants.\n\n- Zero-inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB): Alternatively, model $\\pi_i$ and $\\mu_i$ jointly within a ZINB; include $G_i$ (and $\\log L_i$) in both parts. This directly reflects the mixture and can improve calibration and power when zeros reflect both technical and biological sources.\n\n- Censored (Tobit) regression on log-abundance: If zeros arise primarily from a limit-of-detection, then $A_i=\\log(\\text{abundance}_i)$ is observed only if $A_i>\\tau$; otherwise, it is censored at $\\tau$. A Tobit model,\n$$\nA_i^\\ast \\;=\\; \\alpha + \\beta G_i + \\log L_i + b_i + \\varepsilon_i, \\quad \\varepsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2),\n$$\nwith observation rule $A_i = \\max(A_i^\\ast,\\tau)$, treats zeros as censored rather than structural. Including sample-level random intercepts $b_i$ and depth offset $\\log L_i$ improves calibration relative to naive Gaussian regression on $\\log(1+Y_i)$ when detection limits dominate.\n\n- Robust variance estimation and offsets: Regardless of the chosen mean model, including $\\log L_i$ as an offset and using random effects for batch reduce confounding. Robust (sandwich) standard errors address heteroscedasticity but do not remove bias from ignoring $\\pi_i$.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This statement aligns with the derivations. Zero inflation reduces the effective mean to $(1-\\pi_i)\\mu_i$, inflates variance, and thus reduces power. If $\\pi_i$ varies with $G_i$ or correlates through confounders, naive models conflate $\\beta$ with $\\pi_i$, producing spurious associations. A two-part hurdle model with a logistic component for zeros and an NB component for positive counts, including $\\log L_i$ as an offset and batch random effects, directly targets the mixture structure and preserves interpretability. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. The claim that zero inflation primarily causes upward bias and maintains valid type I error under log-normal regression is contradicted by the delta-method analysis: the slope is attenuated by $(1-\\pi_i)$ when $\\pi_i$ is constant, and type I error can be inflated when $\\pi_i$ varies with $G_i$. Dropping all zeros induces selection bias and discards information, not an optimal strategy. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. Adding a pseudocount and fitting a standard NB GLM does not model $\\pi_i$ explicitly; extra zeros cannot be fully absorbed by dispersion, especially when $\\pi_i$ varies with $G_i$. Pseudocounts change the scale but do not resolve bias or confounding from the zero mechanism. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Treating zeros as censored is appropriate when they arise from a detection limit. A Tobit model on log-abundance with genotype effects, sample-level random intercepts, and a depth offset addresses censoring and improves calibration relative to naive Gaussian regression. This is a principled alternative when structural zeros are unlikely. Verdict: Correct.\n\nE. Rank-based tests ignore offsets and can be sensitive to ties at zero; without modeling $\\log L_i$ or the zero mechanism, ranks do not automatically confer robustness, and power can be reduced or associations biased when zero patterns correlate with $G_i$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct options are A and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "4562156"}]}
