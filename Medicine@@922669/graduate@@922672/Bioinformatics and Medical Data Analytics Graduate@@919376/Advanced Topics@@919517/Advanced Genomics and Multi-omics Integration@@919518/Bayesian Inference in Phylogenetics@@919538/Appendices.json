The solution proceeds in three main steps: first, defining the likelihood function based on the given Poisson process model; second, combining the likelihood with the specified Gamma prior to find the posterior distribution; and third, calculating the mean of this posterior distribution and evaluating it numerically.\n\nFirst, we establish the likelihood function. The number of substitutions $k_i$ on a specific branch $i$ is modeled as a realization of a Poisson process. The length of branch $i$ is $l_i = p_i T$. The rate of the substitution process is $r$ substitutions per year. The parameter of the Poisson distribution for branch $i$, which is its expected number of substitutions, is the product of the rate and the duration (branch length): $\\lambda_i = r l_i = r p_i T$.\n\nThe probability mass function for a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda_i$ is $P(k_i|\\lambda_i) = \\frac{\\lambda_i^{k_i} \\exp(-\\lambda_i)}{k_i!}$. Substituting the expression for $\\lambda_i$, we obtain the probability of observing $k_i$ substitutions on branch $i$, conditional on the tree height $T$:\n$$ P(k_i | T, p_i, r) = \\frac{(r p_i T)^{k_i} \\exp(-r p_i T)}{k_i!} $$\nThe problem states that substitutions on different branches are independent events, conditional on $T$. Therefore, the total likelihood of observing the set of substitution counts $\\{k_i\\}_{i=1}^{m}$ across all $m$ branches is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$ L(\\{k_i\\}_{i=1}^{m} | T) = \\prod_{i=1}^{m} P(k_i | T, p_i, r) = \\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\frac{(r p_i T)^{k_i} \\exp(-r p_i T)}{k_i!} $$\nTo find the posterior distribution of $T$, we only need the part of the likelihood function that depends on $T$. We can group the terms:\n$$ L(\\{k_i\\}_{i=1}^{m} | T) = \\frac{\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{m} p_i^{k_i}\\right) \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{m} r^{k_i}\\right) \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{m} T^{k_i}\\right) \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\exp(-r p_i T)\\right)}{\\prod_{i=1}^{m} k_i!} $$\nWe can simplify the products involving $T$:\n$$ \\prod_{i=1}^{m} T^{k_i} = T^{\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_i} = T^K $$\n$$ \\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\exp(-r p_i T) = \\exp\\left(-\\sum_{i=1}^{m} r p_i T\\right) = \\exp\\left(-r T \\sum_{i=1}^{m} p_i\\right) = \\exp(-r S_p T) $$\nwhere $K = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_i$ and $S_p = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} p_i$ are the given summary statistics.\nThe likelihood function, viewed as a function of $T$, is therefore proportional to:\n$$ L(T) \\propto T^K \\exp(-r S_p T) $$\n\nNext, we incorporate the prior distribution for $T$.

As a function of $T$, the prior is proportional to:\n$$ p(T) \\propto T^{\\alpha - 1} \\exp(-\\beta T) $$\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior distribution of $T$ is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior:\n$$ p(T | \\{k_i\\}, \\{p_i\\}, r, \\alpha, \\beta) \\propto L(T) \\times p(T) $$\n$$ p(T | \\dots) \\propto \\left(T^K \\exp(-r S_p T)\\right) \\times \\left(T^{\\alpha - 1} \\exp(-\\beta T)\\right) $$\nCombining the terms, we get:\n$$ p(T | \\dots) \\propto T^{K + \\alpha - 1} \\exp(-(r S_p + \\beta)T) $$\nThis expression is the kernel of a Gamma distribution. A Gamma distribution with shape parameter $\\alpha'$ and rate parameter $\\beta'$ has a density proportional to $T^{\\alpha' - 1} \\exp(-\\beta' T)$. By comparing this form with our posterior, we can identify the parameters of the posterior distribution:\nThe posterior shape parameter is $\\alpha' = K + \\alpha$.\nThe posterior rate parameter is $\\beta' = r S_p + \\beta$.\nThus, the posterior distribution for $T$ is a Gamma distribution:\n$$ T | \\{k_i\\}, \\{p_i\\}, r, \\alpha, \\beta \\sim \\mathrm{Gamma}(K + \\alpha, r S_p + \\beta) $$\n\nThe problem asks for the posterior mean of $T$. The mean of a Gamma distribution with shape $\\alpha'$ and rate $\\beta'$ is given by the ratio $\\frac{\\alpha'}{\\beta'}$. Therefore, the posterior mean of $T$, denoted $E[T | \\text{data}]$, is:\n$$ E[T | \\text{data}] = \\frac{K + \\alpha}{r S_p + \\beta} $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided values: $K = 196$, $S_p = 20$, $r = 1.6$, $\\alpha = 4$, and $\\beta = 8$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the posterior mean:\n$$ E[T | \\text{data}] = \\frac{196 + 4}{1.6 \\times 20 + 8} $$\nWe calculate the numerator and the denominator separately:\nNumerator: $196 + 4 = 200$.\nDenominator: $1.6 \\times 20 + 8 = 32 + 8 = 40$.\nThe posterior mean is:\n$$ E[T | \\text{data}] = \\frac{200}{40} = 5 $$\nThe unit of $T$ is years.

To explicitly account for this ascertainment, they use an ascertainment-corrected likelihood that conditions on observing a variable site. Assume the following modeling choices, which the team regards as the fundamental base for inference:\n\n- The sequence evolution across sites follows the Cavender–Farris–Neyman (CFN) model (two-state symmetric continuous-time Markov chain) on a rooted $3$-taxon tree, with independent and identically distributed sites, and stationary base frequencies $P(0)=P(1)=\\tfrac{1}{2}$.\n- Along an edge $e$, the probability of a state change is denoted by $s_{e} \\in [0, \\tfrac{1}{2}]$, and the probability of no change is $1 - s_{e}$.

The alternative topology $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ is $((A,C),B)$ with the same edge-specific change probabilities attached to corresponding pendant and internal edges.\n- The ascertainment-corrected (Lewis-type) likelihood for each site is the ordinary site likelihood divided by the probability that the site is variable under the model, so that inference is performed conditional on variability.\n\nFrom $N$ variable SNPs, the team tallies parsimony-informative pattern counts, where $n_{AB|C}$ denotes the number of variable sites in which $A$ and $B$ share the same state and differ from $C$ (collapsing the two complementary assignments), and analogously for $n_{AC|B}$ and $n_{BC|A}$.
