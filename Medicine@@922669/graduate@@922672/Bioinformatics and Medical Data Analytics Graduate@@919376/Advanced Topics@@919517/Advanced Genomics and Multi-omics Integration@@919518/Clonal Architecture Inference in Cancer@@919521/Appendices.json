The derivation will proceed from first principles by considering the allelic contributions of the normal and cancerous cell populations within the sample.\n\nLet us consider a representative tissue sample containing a total of $N_{\\text{total}}$ cells.

This gives rise to three distinct rooted labeled topologies:\n\n1.  A linear chain where $C_2$ is a child of $C_1$, and $C_3$ is a child of $C_2$. The topology is $C_1 \\to C_2 \\to C_3$.\n2.  A linear chain where $C_3$ is a child of $C_1$, and $C_2$ is a child of $C_3$. The topology is $C_1 \\to C_3 \\to C_2$.\n3.  A branched structure where both $C_2$ and $C_3$ are children of $C_1$.\n\nEach of these topologies must be tested against the Ancestry Rule and the Sum Rule using the CCF data from both samples $S_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and $S_{\\mathrm{B}}$. A topology is valid only if it satisfies the rules for both samples.\n\nThe CCF data is:\n-   $S_{\\mathrm{A}}$: $CCF(C_1, S_{\\mathrm{A}}) = 0.95$, $CCF(C_2, S_{\\mathrm{A}}) = 0.40$, $CCF(C_3, S_{\\mathrm{A}}) = 0.55$.\n-   $S_{\\mathrm{B}}$: $CCF(C_1, S_{\\mathrm{B}}) = 0.96$, $CCF(C_2, S_{\\mathrm{B}}) = 0.60$, $CCF(C_3, S_{\\mathrm{B}}) = 0.25$.\n\nLet's evaluate each topology.\n\n**Topology 1: $C_1 \\to C_2 \\to C_3$**\nIn this topology, $C_1$ is the parent of $C_2$, and $C_2$ is the parent of $C_3$.\n-   **Ancestry Rule**: We must have $CCF(C_2, S) \\le CCF(C_1, S)$ and $CCF(C_3, S) \\le CCF(C_2, S)$ for $S \\in \\{S_{\\mathrm{A}}, S_{\\mathrm{B}}\\}$.\n-   **Sum Rule**:\n    -   For $C_1$: $CCF(C_1, S) \\ge CCF(C_2, S)$.\n    -   For $C_2$: $CCF(C_2, S) \\ge CCF(C_3, S)$.\n    -   For $C_3$: The sum of children's CCFs is $0$.\nThe sum rule for a single child is identical to the direct parent-child ancestry rule. Therefore, we only need to check the ancestry rule: $CCF(C_3, S) \\le CCF(C_2, S) \\le CCF(C_1, S)$.\n\n-   Check for sample $S_{\\mathrm{A}}$:\n    -   Is $CCF(C_3, S_{\\mathrm{A}}) \\le CCF(C_2, S_{\\mathrm{A}})$? Is $0.55 \\le 0.40$? This is **false**.\nSince the topology fails for sample $S_{\\mathrm{A}}$, it is not a valid phylogeny. We do not need to check sample $S_{\\mathrm{B}}$.\n*Conclusion for Topology 1: Invalid.*\n\n**Topology 2: $C_1 \\to C_3 \\to C_2$**\nIn this topology, $C_1$ is the parent of $C_3$, and $C_3$ is the parent of $C_2$.\n-   **Ancestry Rule**: We must have $CCF(C_3, S) \\le CCF(C_1, S)$ and $CCF(C_2, S) \\le CCF(C_3, S)$ for $S \\in \\{S_{\\mathrm{A}}, S_{\\mathrm{B}}\\}$.\n-   **Sum Rule**: This imposes the same constraints as the ancestry rule for a linear chain: $CCF(C_2, S) \\le CCF(C_3, S) \\le CCF(C_1, S)$.\n\n-   Check for sample $S_{\\mathrm{A}}$:\n    -   Is $CCF(C_2, S_{\\mathrm{A}}) \\le CCF(C_3, S_{\\mathrm{A}})$? Is $0.40 \\le 0.55$? Yes.\n    -   Is $CCF(C_3, S_{\\mathrm{A}}) \\le CCF(C_1, S_{\\mathrm{A}})$? Is $0.55 \\le 0.95$? Yes.\n    The topology is consistent with the data from sample $S_{\\mathrm{A}}$.\n\n-   Check for sample $S_{\\mathrm{B}}$:\n    -   Is $CCF(C_2, S_{\\mathrm{B}}) \\le CCF(C_3, S_{\\mathrm{B}})$? Is $0.60 \\le 0.25$? This is **false**.\nSince the topology fails for sample $S_{\\mathrm{B}}$, it is not a valid phylogeny overall.\n*Conclusion for Topology 2: Invalid.*\n\n**Topology 3: Branched ($C_2$ and $C_3$ are siblings)**\nIn this topology, $C_1$ is the parent of both $C_2$ and $C_3$.\n-   **Ancestry Rule**: We must have $CCF(C_2, S) \\le CCF(C_1, S)$ and $CCF(C_3, S) \\le CCF(C_1, S)$ for $S \\in \\{S_{\\mathrm{A}}, S_{\\mathrm{B}}\\}$.\n-   **Sum Rule**: For the parent node $C_1$, we must have $CCF(C_1, S) \\ge CCF(C_2, S) + CCF(C_3, S)$. For nodes $C_2$ and $C_3$, the rule is trivially satisfied as they have no children.\n\nWe must check both conditions for both samples.\n\n-   Check for sample $S_{\\mathrm{A}}$:\n    1.  **Ancestry Rule**:\n        -   Is $CCF(C_2, S_{\\mathrm{A}}) \\le CCF(C_1, S_{\\mathrm{A}})$? Is $0.40 \\le 0.95$? Yes.\n        -   Is $CCF(C_3, S_{\\mathrm{A}}) \\le CCF(C_1, S_{\\mathrm{A}})$? Is $0.55 \\le 0.95$? Yes.\n    2.  **Sum Rule**:\n        -   Is $CCF(C_1, S_{\\mathrm{A}}) \\ge CCF(C_2, S_{\\mathrm{A}}) + CCF(C_3, S_{\\mathrm{A}})$?\n        -   Is $0.95 \\ge 0.40 + 0.55$? Is $0.95 \\ge 0.95$? Yes.\n    The topology is consistent with the data from sample $S_{\\mathrm{A}}$.\n\n-   Check for sample $S_{\\mathrm{B}}$:\n    1.  **Ancestry Rule**:\n        -   Is $CCF(C_2, S_{\\mathrm{B}}) \\le CCF(C_1, S_{\\mathrm{B}})$? Is $0.60 \\le 0.96$? Yes.\n        -   Is $CCF(C_3, S_{\\mathrm{B}}) \\le CCF(C_1, S_{\\mathrm{B}})$? Is $0.25 \\le 0.96$? Yes.\n    2.  **Sum Rule**:\n        -   Is $CCF(C_1, S_{\\mathrm{B}}) \\ge CCF(C_2, S_{\\mathrm{B}}) + CCF(C_3, S_{\\mathrm{B}})$?\n        -   Is $0.96 \\ge 0.60 + 0.25$? Is $0.96 \\ge 0.85$? Yes.\n    The topology is also consistent with the data from sample $S_{\\mathrm{B}}$.\n\nSince this topology is valid for both samples, it is a valid phylogenetic tree for the given data.\n*Conclusion for Topology 3: Valid.*\n\n### Final Count\n-   Topology 1 ($C_1 \\to C_2 \\to C_3$): Invalid.\n-   Topology 2 ($C_1 \\to C_3 \\to C_2$): Invalid.\n-   Topology 3 (Branched): Valid.\n\nOut of the three possible topologies, only one is consistent with the CCF data from both samples.
