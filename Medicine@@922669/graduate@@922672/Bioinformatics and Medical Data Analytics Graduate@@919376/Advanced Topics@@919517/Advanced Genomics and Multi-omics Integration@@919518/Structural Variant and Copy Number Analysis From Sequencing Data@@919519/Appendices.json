A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThis problem requires the synthesis of two independent types of evidence from sequencing data: read-pair analysis and read-depth analysis.\n\n**1. Analysis of Read-Pair Evidence**\n\nA mate-pair library is designed to sequence the two ends of a long DNA fragment. For a fragment of actual size $I_{frag}$ from the sample, the expected orientation of the mapped reads on the reference genome is outward-facing ($\\rightarrow \\dots \\leftarrow$). In the absence of structural variation, the distance between the mapped reads on the reference, $D_{obs}$, will be approximately equal to $I_{frag}$. The library construction process yields a distribution of fragment sizes, given here as a Gaussian with mean $\\mu = 3.3\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{kb}$.\n\nThe key observation is that the observed distance, $D_{obs} \\approx 5.3\\,\\mathrm{kb}$, is significantly larger than the expected mean distance $\\mu = 3.3\\,\\mathrm{kb}$. The difference is $D_{obs} - \\mu \\approx 5.3\\,\\mathrm{kb} - 3.3\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$. Let's analyze what type of SV produces this signature:\n- **Deletion**: If a segment of length $L_{del}$ is deleted from the sample's genome relative to the reference, a DNA fragment of size $I_{frag} \\approx \\mu$ that spans the deletion will have its ends map to the reference with an apparent separation of $D_{obs} = I_{frag} + L_{del}$. This results in an increased observed distance. In our case, this hypothesis predicts a deletion of size $L_{del} \\approx D_{obs} - \\mu = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$. The orientation remains the standard outward-facing one. This is consistent with the data.\n- **Insertion**: If a segment of length $L_{ins}$ is inserted into the sample's genome, a DNA fragment of size $I_{frag} \\approx \\mu$ spanning the insertion will have its ends map to the reference with a separation of $D_{obs} = I_{frag} - L_{ins}$. This results in a decreased observed distance. This contradicts the data.\n- **Inversion**: An inversion results in segments being flipped. Mate pairs spanning the inversion breakpoints will map with an anomalous orientation, typically same-strand pairs ($\\rightarrow \\dots \\rightarrow$ or $\\leftarrow \\dots \\leftarrow$). The problem explicitly states these are not observed. This contradicts the data.\n- **Translocation**: An interchromosomal translocation would result in mate pairs mapping to different chromosomes. The problem explicitly states these are not observed. This contradicts the data.\n\nThe read-pair evidence strongly points towards a deletion of approximately $2.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$.\n\n**2. Analysis of Read-Depth Evidence**\n\nThe baseline read depth is approximately $30\\times$. For a diploid sample, this coverage level corresponds to a copy number ($\\text{CN}$) of $2$. The problem states that within the interval of interest, the depth drops to approximately $15\\times$. Since read depth is assumed to be proportional to copy number, a drop in depth from $30\\times$ to $15\\times$ implies a change in copy number from $\\text{CN}=2$ to $\\text{CN}=1$.\n\nLet's evaluate the copy number change for different SVs:\n- **Heterozygous Deletion**: One of the two homologous chromosomes loses a segment. The copy number in that region changes from $2$ to $1$. This perfectly matches the observed depth change.\n- **Homozygous Deletion**: Both homologous chromosomes lose the segment. The copy number changes from $2$ to $0$, and the depth should drop to $0$. This contradicts the data.\n- **Heterozygous Duplication**: One chromosome gains an extra copy of a segment. The copy number changes from $2$ to $3$. The depth should increase to approximately $30 \\times (3/2) = 45\\times$. This contradicts the data.\n- **Balanced SVs (Inversion, Balanced Translocation)**: These events rearrange DNA but do not change the total amount of material. Therefore, they do not cause a large-scale change in copy number or read depth within the segment. This contradicts the data.\n\nThe read-depth evidence points unambiguously to a heterozygous deletion. Furthermore, the span of this depth drop is given as $L \\approx 2.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$.\n\n**3. Synthesis of All Evidence**\n\n- The read-pair analysis indicates a deletion of size $\\approx 2.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$.\n- The read-depth analysis indicates a heterozygous deletion of size $\\approx 2.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$.\n- The absence of same-strand or interchromosomal pairs rules out simple inversions and translocations.\n\nThe two independent sources of evidence are in perfect agreement, both identifying the event as a deletion and estimating its size to be approximately $2.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$. The heterozygosity is confirmed by the halving of the read depth.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Heterozygous deletion in a diploid sample**\nThis hypothesis is consistent with all observations.\n- The increased mate-pair distance ($5.3\\,\\mathrm{kb}  3.3\\,\\mathrm{kb}$) with standard outward-facing orientation is the classic signature of a deletion. The size is estimated as $5.3 - 3.3 = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$.\n- The drop in read depth from $\\approx 30\\times$ to $\\approx 15\\times$ indicates a copy number change from $2$ to $1$, which defines a heterozygous event.\n- The span of the depth drop, $L \\approx 2.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$, matches the size estimated from the read pairs.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Tandem (head-to-tail) duplication**\nThis hypothesis is contradicted by the read-depth data. A heterozygous duplication would increase the copy number from $2$ to $3$, causing an increase in read depth to $\\approx 45\\times$, not a decrease to $15\\times$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Inversion**\nThis hypothesis is contradicted by two key pieces of evidence. First, a balanced inversion would not cause a change in read depth. Second, inversions are characterized by mate pairs with same-strand orientations ($\\rightarrow \\dots \\rightarrow$ or $\\leftarrow \\dots \\leftarrow$) at the breakpoints, which are explicitly stated to be absent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Balanced interchromosomal translocation**\nThis hypothesis is contradicted by two key pieces of evidence. First, a balanced translocation would not cause a change in read depth. Second, interchromosomal translocations are characterized by mate pairs mapping to different chromosomes, which are explicitly stated to be absent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Hemizygous insertion of a mobile element**\nThis hypothesis is contradicted by the read-pair data. An insertion would cause the observed mate-pair distance to be *smaller* than the library mean ($D_{obs}  \\mu$), as the inserted sequence in the sample is absent from the reference, bringing the mapping locations of the mates closer together. The observation is a *larger* distance ($5.3\\,\\mathrm{kb}  3.3\\,\\mathrm{kb}$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4611578"}, {"introduction": "After identifying a potential signal, a crucial next step is to determine if it represents true biological variation or a technical artifact.

The model relating read depth to copy number and mappability is a standard, albeit simplified, model used in practice.

The problem is not underspecified or overconstrained. All data required for the analysis are present.\n- **No Other Flaws**: The problem does not violate any other validation criteria (e.g., it is not trivial, unrealistic, or non-formalizable).\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. I will now proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central task is to determine whether the observed oscillations in read depth ($d_i$) are due to a true copy number variation (CNV) or are merely an artifact of variable mappability ($m_i$). We will use the provided model and data to test these competing hypotheses.\n\nThe core modeling assumption is that the expected average per-base depth in a subregion $i$ is given by:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[d_i] = \\mu \\cdot c \\cdot m_i $$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the per-copy sequencing yield, $c$ is the local copy number, and $m_i$ is the mappability of the region.\n\nThis model implies that if we compute a \"mappability-normalized depth,\" let's call it $d'_i$, by dividing the observed depth $d_i$ by the mappability $m_i$, this new quantity should be proportional only to the copy number $c$:\n$$ d'_i = \\frac{d_i}{m_i} $$\nIts expected value is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[d'_i] = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[d_i]}{m_i} = \\frac{\\mu \\cdot c \\cdot m_i}{m_i} = \\mu \\cdot c $$\nTherefore, if the copy number $c$ is constant across the locus, the mappability-normalized depths $d'_i$ should also be approximately constant.\n\nFirst, let's establish the expected baseline for a diploid region ($c=2$). The problem states that in high-mappability ($m \\approx 1$) autosomal regions, the mean coverage is $d_0 = 30.0$ for a diploid state ($c=2$). Using our model, the expected mappability-normalized depth for any diploid region is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[d']_{diploid} = \\frac{d_0}{m} \\approx \\frac{30.0}{1.0} = 30.0 $$\nThis value, $30.0$, represents our reference for a copy number of $2$. From this, we can also estimate the per-copy sequencing yield $\\mu$:\n$$ \\mu \\cdot c = 30.0 \\implies \\mu \\cdot 2 = 30.0 \\implies \\mu = 15.0 $$\n\nNow, let's calculate the mappability-normalized depth $d'_i$ for each of the $5$ subregions using the provided data:\n- Subregion $1$: $d'_1 = \\frac{d_1}{m_1} = \\frac{29.7}{1.0} = 29.7$\n- Subregion $2$: $d'_2 = \\frac{d_2}{m_2} = \\frac{14.8}{0.5} = 29.6$\n- Subregion $3$: $d'_3 = \\frac{d_3}{m_3} = \\frac{31.2}{1.0} = 31.2$\n- Subregion $4$: $d'_4 = \\frac{d_4}{m_4} = \\frac{15.1}{0.5} = 30.2$\n- Subregion $5$: $d'_5 = \\frac{d_5}{m_5} = \\frac{30.5}{1.0} = 30.5$\n\nThe resulting mappability-normalized depths are $(29.7, 29.6, 31.2, 30.2, 30.5)$. These values are remarkably constant and cluster tightly around the genome-wide diploid baseline of $d_0 = 30.0$. The initial, strong oscillations in the raw depth data $(29.7, 14.8, 31.2, 15.1, 30.5)$ have been completely resolved by correcting for mappability. This is compelling evidence that the copy number $c$ is constant across all $5$ subregions and is equal to $2$.\n\nThe problem provides a second, independent line of evidence: the B-allele frequency (BAF) of heterozygous SNPs. The statement says there are $N=40$ such SNPs \"with observed alternate allele fraction distributed around $0.50$.\" For a heterozygous SNP (e.g., genotype AB), a BAF of $0.50$ is the canonical signature of a diploid state ($c=2$), where one chromosome carries allele A and the other carries allele B, and they are sequenced to roughly equal depth. Other copy states would typically result in different BAFs. For example, a heterozygous duplication ($c=3$, genotype AAB or ABB) would produce BAFs clustering around $1/3 \\approx 0.33$ and $2/3 \\approx 0.67$. A heterozygous deletion ($c=1$) would result in hemizygosity, eliminating heterozygosity and producing BAFs of $0$ or $1$. The observed BAF distribution centered at $0.50$ strongly corroborates the conclusion from the read depth analysis that the locus is diploid ($c=2$).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The oscillations are explained by mapping bias: after dividing $d_i$ by $m_i$, the mappability-normalized depths are approximately constant and equal to the diploid baseline $d_0$, the Poisson likelihood is maximized near $c=2$, and the B-allele frequency (BAF) remains centered near $0.50$.**\n\n- Our calculations show that the mappability-normalized depths $d'_i$ are indeed approximately constant and equal to the diploid baseline $d_0 = 30.0$.\n- With an expected depth of $\\mathbb{E}[d_i] = \\mu \\cdot c \\cdot m_i = 15.0 \\cdot 2 \\cdot m_i = 30 m_i$, the expected depth vector for $c=2$ is $(30.0, 15.0, 30.0, 15.0, 30.0)$. This is an excellent match to the observed depths $(29.7, 14.8, 31.2, 15.1, 30.5)$. Any other integer copy number would produce a much worse fit, meaning the Poisson likelihood for the observed read counts is maximized at $c=2$.\n- The problem statement explicitly provides that the BAF is centered near $0.50$.\n- All parts of this statement are supported by the data and our analysis.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The locus harbors a heterozygous tandem duplication ($c=3$): after correcting for mappability, the normalized depth is approximately $1.5\\times d_0$, and the B-allele frequency (BAF) shifts toward modes near $0.33$ and $0.67$.**\n\n- A copy number of $c=3$ would imply a mappability-normalized depth of $\\mu \\cdot c = 15.0 \\cdot 3 = 45.0$. This is $1.5 \\times d_0 = 1.5 \\times 30.0 = 45.0$. Our calculated normalized depths are all near $30.0$, not $45.0$.\n- A copy number of $c=3$ would cause BAFs to shift to $\\approx 0.33$ and $\\approx 0.67$, but the data shows BAFs are centered at $0.50$.\n- This option is contradicted by both the read depth and BAF evidence.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The locus harbors a mosaic hemizygous deletion (effective $c \\approx 1.5$): the normalized depth is uniformly reduced below $d_0$ after mappability correction, and the B-allele frequency (BAF) is skewed away from $0.50$.**\n\n- An effective copy number of $c=1.5$ would imply a mappability-normalized depth of $\\mu \\cdot c = 15.0 \\cdot 1.5 = 22.5$. Our calculated normalized depths are all near $30.0$, not $22.5$.\n- The problem states the BAF is centered around $0.50$, not skewed away from it.\n- This option is contradicted by both the read depth and BAF evidence.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The locus contains a complex event that duplicates only the low-mappability subregions: this yields equal mappability-normalized depths in high- and low-mappability bins but an overall increase in total depth relative to $d_0$, consistent with $c2$ despite flat B-allele frequency (BAF).**\n\n- This option proposes that the copy number is not uniform: e.g., $c=2$ in high-mappability regions ($1,3,5$) and $c2$ in low-mappability regions ($2,4$). If $c=2$ in regions $1,3,5$, the normalized depth is $\\approx 30.0$. For the normalized depth in regions $2,4$ to also be $\\approx 30.0$, their copy number must also be $c=2$ (since $d'_i = \\mu c_i$ and $\\mu$ is constant). The premise that copy number is different yet normalized depth is the same is a contradiction. A duplication ($c2$) in regions $2$ and $4$ would have resulted in a *higher* normalized depth in those regions (e.g., $d'_i = 45.0$ for $c=3$), not an equal one.\n- The claim of \"an overall increase in total depth relative to $d_0$\" is false. After normalization, the depth is equal to $d_0$.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4611551"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the theoretical limits of a detection method is essential for designing robust experiments and correctly interpreting their results.

This is a function of the average coverage $C$, the bin width $w$, and the read length $L$. The total number of base pairs sequenced is the genome size $G$ times the coverage $C$. The total number of reads is this value divided by the read length $L$. The fraction of reads falling into a bin of width $w$ is $w/G$. Thus, the mean read count per bin is:\n$$ m = \\left(\\frac{C \\times G}{L}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{w}{G}\\right) = \\frac{C \\times w}{L} $$\nUsing the provided values $C=30$, $w=10\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 10000\\,\\mathrm{bp}$, and $L=150\\,\\mathrm{bp}$:\n$$ m = \\frac{30 \\times 10000}{150} = \\frac{300000}{150} = 2000 $$\n\nNext, we define the statistical properties of the bin counts under both the null hypothesis ($H_0$, diploid region) and the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$, heterozygous deletion). The problem states that counts follow a Negative Binomial distribution.\n\nUnder $H_0$, the count $X_i$ in bin $i$ has mean and variance:\n$$ E[X_i] = m = 2000 $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(X_i) = m + \\phi m^2 $$\nWith the overdispersion parameter $\\phi = 0.02$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(X_i) = 2000 + 0.02 \\times (2000)^2 = 2000 + 0.02 \\times 4000000 = 2000 + 80000 = 82000 $$\n\nUnder $H_1$, a heterozygous deletion reduces the local copy number from $2$ to $1$. Assuming uniform read sampling, the expected read count is halved. Let $Y_i$ be the count in a deleted bin:\n$$ E[Y_i] = \\frac{m}{2} = \\frac{2000}{2} = 1000 $$\n\nThe detection algorithm aggregates counts over $B$ contiguous bins. Let $X_{\\mathrm{agg}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{B} X_i$ and $Y_{\\mathrm{agg}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{B} Y_i$ be the aggregated counts for the baseline and deletion regions, respectively. Assuming bin counts are independent:\n$$ E[X_{\\mathrm{agg}}] = B \\cdot E[X_i] = Bm $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(X_{\\mathrm{agg}}) = B \\cdot \\mathrm{Var}(X_i) = B(m + \\phi m^2) $$\n$$ E[Y_{\\mathrm{agg}}] = B \\cdot E[Y_i] = \\frac{Bm}{2} $$\n\nThe $z$-score is computed by standardizing the observed aggregated count from the deletion region ($Y_{\\mathrm{agg}}$) using the mean and standard deviation of the diploid baseline distribution:\n$$ z = \\frac{Y_{\\mathrm{agg}} - E[X_{\\mathrm{agg}}]}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(X_{\\mathrm{agg}})}} = \\frac{Y_{\\mathrm{agg}} - Bm}{\\sqrt{B(m + \\phi m^2)}} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the condition where the *expected* standardized shift meets the threshold $z_{\\mathrm{thr}}$. We calculate the expectation of $z$ under the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$):\n$$ E[z] = E\\left[ \\frac{Y_{\\mathrm{agg}} - Bm}{\\sqrt{B(m + \\phi m^2)}} \\right] = \\frac{E[Y_{\\mathrm{agg}}] - Bm}{\\sqrt{B(m + \\phi m^2)}} $$\nSubstituting $E[Y_{\\mathrm{agg}}] = Bm/2$:\n$$ E[z] = \\frac{Bm/2 - Bm}{\\sqrt{B(m + \\phi m^2)}} = \\frac{-Bm/2}{\\sqrt{B(m + \\phi m^2)}} $$\n\nA deletion corresponds to a downward shift, so the expected $z$-score is negative. The detection criterion is met when the magnitude of this expected shift reaches the threshold $z_{\\mathrm{thr}}=4$. So, we set $E[z] = -z_{\\mathrm{thr}}$ (or more generally, $E[z] \\leq -z_{\\mathrm{thr}}$).\n$$ \\frac{-Bm/2}{\\sqrt{B(m + \\phi m^2)}} \\leq -z_{\\mathrm{thr}} $$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality:\n$$ \\frac{Bm/2}{\\sqrt{B(m + \\phi m^2)}} \\geq z_{\\mathrm{thr}} $$\nWe can simplify the left-hand side:\n$$ \\frac{\\sqrt{B} m / 2}{\\sqrt{m + \\phi m^2}} \\geq z_{\\mathrm{thr}} $$\nNow, we solve for the number of bins, $B$:\n$$ \\sqrt{B} \\geq \\frac{2 z_{\\mathrm{thr}} \\sqrt{m + \\phi m^2}}{m} $$\n$$ B \\geq \\left( \\frac{2 z_{\\mathrm{thr}} \\sqrt{m + \\phi m^2}}{m} \\right)^2 = \\frac{4 z_{\\mathrm{thr}}^2 (m + \\phi m^2)}{m^2} = \\frac{4 z_{\\mathrm{thr}}^2 (1 + \\phi m)}{m} $$\nSubstitute the known values: $z_{\\mathrm{thr}}=4$, $\\phi=0.02$, and $m=2000$.\n$$ B \\geq \\frac{4 \\times 4^2 \\times (1 + 0.02 \\times 2000)}{2000} $$\n$$ B \\geq \\frac{64 \\times (1 + 40)}{2000} = \\frac{64 \\times 41}{2000} = \\frac{2624}{2000} = 1.312 $$\n\nThe problem states that the deletion spans an integer number $B$ of bins. To satisfy the condition $B \\geq 1.312$, the minimal integer number of bins required for detection is the ceiling of this value.\n$$ B_{\\min} = \\lceil 1.312 \\rceil = 2 $$\nThe minimal deletion length, $L_{\\min}$, is the product of $B_{\\min}$ and the bin width $w=10\\,\\mathrm{kb}$.\n$$ L_{\\min} = B_{\\min} \\times w = 2 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 20\\,\\mathrm{kb} $$\nThe final answer is required in $\\mathrm{kb}$ and rounded to three significant figures. The exact answer is $20\\,\\mathrm{kb}$. Expressed to three significant figures, this is $20.0\\,\\mathrm{kb}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{20.0}\n$$", "id": "4611564"}]}
