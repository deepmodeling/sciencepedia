The dataset includes three variables: (i) a visit date recorded as a full calendar date in the format $YYYY$-$MM$-$DD$ (for example, $2023$-$07$-$14$), (ii) a 3-digit postal code prefix ($\\text{zip3}$), and (iii) age in integer years. Sample records include ages 45, 90, and 101, and the $\\text{zip3}$ values $021$, $036$, and $098$. The team has verified from current publicly available Bureau of the Census data that the aggregated populations associated with these $\\text{zip3}$ prefixes are: $021 \\mapsto 2{,}000{,}000$, $036 \\mapsto 12{,}400$, and $098 \\mapsto 25{,}300$.\n\nAs the context-appropriate fundamental base, recall the following core definitions and rules of the HIPAA Safe Harbor approach to de-identification: (1) Protected Health Information (PHI) encompasses individually identifiable health information; (2) under Safe Harbor, release requires removal of enumerated identifiers such that the information cannot identify an individual; among the enumerated identifiers are (a) all geographic subdivisions smaller than a state, except that the initial 3 digits of a United States ZIP code may be retained only if the geographic unit formed by combining all ZIP codes with the same 3 initial digits contains more than 20,000 people, otherwise the ZIP must be changed to $000$; (b) all elements of dates (for dates directly related to an individual) except the year; and (c) ages $> 89$ must be aggregated into a single category of $90$ or older. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), pseudonymized data may still be personal data, but HIPAA Safe Harbor provides a specific de-identification pathway for United States covered entities.\n\nAssuming the dataset contains no other identifiers beyond the three variables described, determine whether the dataset, as currently structured, meets HIPAA Safe Harbor requirements. If it does not, select the option that correctly identifies the transformations needed to achieve compliance, adhering to minimal distortion consistent with the Safe Harbor rules.\n\nChoose one option:\n\nA. The dataset already complies because it uses 3-digit ZIP codes and ages in years; no changes are needed, and full dates may be retained.\n\nB.

Visit date: A full calendar date in the format $YYYY$-$MM$-$DD$.\n    2.  $3$-digit postal code prefix ($\\text{zip3}$).\n    3.  Age: In integer years.\n*   **Sample Data**:\n    *   Ages: $45$, $90$, $101$.\n    *   $\\text{zip3}$ values: $021$, $036$, $098$.\n*   **Census Data for Sample $\\text{zip3}$ Prefixes**:\n    *   The population for the geographic unit corresponding to $\\text{zip3} = 021$ is $2{,}000{,}000$.\n    *   The population for the geographic unit corresponding to $\\text{zip3} = 036$ is $12{,}400$.\n    *   The population for the geographic unit corresponding to $\\text{zip3} = 098$ is $25{,}300$.\n*   **HIPAA Safe Harbor De-identification Rules**:\n    1.  **Rule (a) - Geography**: All geographic subdivisions smaller than a state must be removed. An exception is made for the initial $3$ digits of a ZIP code ($\\text{zip3}$), which may be retained *only if* the geographic unit formed by combining all ZIP codes with the same $3$ initial digits contains more than $20{,}000$ people. If this condition is not met (i.e., the population is $\\le 20,000$), the $\\text{zip3}$ must be changed to $000$.\n    2.  **Rule (b) - Dates**: For dates directly related to an individual, all elements must be removed except for the year.\n    3.  **Rule (c) - Ages**: Ages greater than 89 (i.e., ages $> 89$) must be aggregated into a single category of $90$ or older.\n\nThe task is to determine if the described dataset is compliant with these rules and, if not, to identify the correct set of transformations required for compliance.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded in the domain of medical data privacy, specifically referencing real-world regulations like HIPAA and GDPR. The rules provided are accurate representations of the HIPAA Safe Harbor method for de-identification. The provided data (ages, ZIP codes, populations) are plausible and serve to create a well-posed problem. The language is objective and precise, and there are no internal contradictions. All necessary information to evaluate the dataset against the given rules is provided. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Solution\n\nTo determine compliance, we must evaluate each of the three variables in the dataset against the corresponding HIPAA Safe Harbor rule.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Visit Date (Rule b)**:\n    *   The dataset contains full calendar dates in the format $YYYY$-$MM$-$DD$.\n    *   Rule (b) explicitly states that \"all elements of dates ... except the year\" must be removed.\n    *   Therefore, retaining the month ($MM$) and day ($DD$) is a violation of the Safe Harbor standard. To comply, each date must be generalized to its year component only ($YYYY$).\n    *   **Conclusion**: The dataset is non-compliant with respect to the visit date variable.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Age (Rule c)**:\n    *   The dataset contains integer ages, with sample records including $45$, $90$, and $101$.\n    *   Rule (c) mandates that \"ages $> 89$ must be aggregated into a single category of $90$ or older\".\n    *   The sample record with age $101$ violates this rule. Any age value $A > 89$ (e.g., $90, 91, ..., 101, ...$) must be recoded into a single category, such as \"90 or older\". The age $45$ is compliant as it is not $> 89$. The age $90$ is also non-compliant in its specific form if other ages $> 89$ exist, as all must be grouped. The rule effectively creates a terminal category for all individuals aged $90$ and above.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The dataset is non-compliant with respect to the age variable.\n\n3.  **Analysis of $3$-digit Postal Code Prefix (Rule a)**:\n    *   The dataset contains $\\text{zip3}$ values, with samples $021$, $036$, and $098$.\n    *   Rule (a) allows retaining a $\\text{zip3}$ only if its corresponding geographic unit population is greater than $20{,}000$. Otherwise, it must be changed to $000$.\n    *   Let's check the sample $\\text{zip3}$ values:\n        *   For $\\text{zip3} = 021$, the population is $2{,}000{,}000$. Since $2{,}000{,}000 > 20{,}000$, this value can be retained.\n        *   For $\\text{zip3} = 036$, the population is $12{,}400$. Since $12{,}400 \\le 20{,}000$, this value must be changed to $000$.\n        *   For $\\text{zip3} = 098$, the population is $25{,}300$. Since $25{,}300 > 20{,}000$, this value can be retained.\n    *   Since at least one $\\text{zip3}$ value ($036$) does not meet the population threshold, the dataset in its current form is non-compliant. The required transformation is to change all such $\\text{zip3}$ values to $000$.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The dataset is non-compliant with respect to the $\\text{zip3}$ variable.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**: The dataset, as currently structured, violates all three of the specified HIPAA Safe Harbor rules. To become compliant, it must be transformed as follows:\n*   All dates must be reduced to the year ($YYYY$).\n*   All ages greater than $89$ must be recoded into a single category of \"$90$ or older\".\n*   All $\\text{zip3}$ values corresponding to geographic units with populations of $20{,}000$ or fewer must be recoded to $000$.\n\n### Step 4: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow we evaluate each option against our derived requirements.\n\n**A. The dataset already complies because it uses $3$-digit ZIP codes and ages in years; no changes are needed, and full dates may be retained.**\n*   This option claims the dataset is already compliant. Our analysis proved it is non-compliant on three counts (dates, ages, and ZIPs). Retaining full dates is a direct violation of Rule (b).\n*   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Replace each visit date by its year (retain only $YYYY$); recode any age $> 89$ into a single category of “$90$ or older”; and rewrite $\\text{zip3}$ values with aggregated population $\\le 20,000$ to $000$ while retaining $\\text{zip3}$ values whose aggregated population $> 20,000$.**\n*   **Date transformation**: \"Replace each visit date by its year (retain only $YYYY$)\". This correctly applies Rule (b).\n*   **Age transformation**: \"recode any age $> 89$ into a single category of '$90$ or older'\". This correctly applies Rule (c).\n*   **ZIP code transformation**: \"rewrite $\\text{zip3}$ values with aggregated population $\\le 20,000$ to $000$ while retaining... population $> 20,000$\". This correctly applies Rule (a).\n*   This option accurately describes all the necessary transformations identified in our derivation.\n*   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Randomize each visit date by adding a uniform offset in the range $[0,30]$ days; keep ages as-is; keep all $3$-digit ZIP codes unchanged.**\n*   Date randomization is a method of de-identification, but it is not the method prescribed by Safe Harbor Rule (b), which requires removing the month and day.\n*   Keeping ages \"as-is\" violates Rule (c).\n*   Keeping all $\\text{zip3}$ codes \"unchanged\" violates Rule (a).\n*   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Generalize each visit date to “month-year” (retain $MM$ and $YYYY$); recode ages into decade bins (for example, $40$–$49$); keep all $3$-digit ZIP codes unchanged.**\n*   Retaining the month ($MM$) violates Rule (b).\n*   Recoding ages into decade bins is a valid generalization technique, but it is not what Safe Harbor Rule (c) requires for ages $> 89$.\n*   Keeping all $\\text{zip3}$ codes \"unchanged\" violates Rule (a).\n*   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Replace all $3$-digit ZIP codes by state-level codes; keep full visit dates and ages as currently recorded because state-level geography satisfies Safe Harbor.**\n*   This option makes a critical logical error. While replacing $\\text{zip3}$ with state-level codes would satisfy the geography requirement (Rule a), it incorrectly argues that this action allows one to ignore the separate, independent requirements for dates (Rule b) and ages (Rule c). Keeping full visit dates and specific ages over $89$ are explicit violations of the Safe Harbor rules.\n*   Verdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "4571089"}, {"introduction": "While the Safe Harbor method is straightforward, the Expert Determination pathway offers more flexibility by relying on statistical assurances that the risk of re-identification is very small.

The concepts of $k$-anonymity, $l$-diversity, and generalization hierarchies are standard in the field of data privacy. The data and hierarchies are clearly defined. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe task is to find the minimal generalization of the quasi-identifiers Age ($A$) and ZIP code ($Z$) that achieves $k$-anonymity with $k=5$, and then to compute the distinct $l$-diversity for the resulting equivalence classes.\n\nThe quasi-identifiers are Age ($A$) and ZIP code ($Z$). The sensitive attribute is Diagnosis ($S$). We are given a dataset of $20$ records. The target for anonymity is $k=5$, meaning each equivalence class (a set of records with identical generalized quasi-identifiers) must contain at least $5$ records.\n\nThe generalization hierarchies are defined for $A$ and $Z$. Let $g_A^i$ denote the generalization function for Age at level $i$, and $g_Z^j$ denote the generalization function for ZIP code at level $j$. We seek the minimal pair of levels $(i,j)$ that satisfies $5$-anonymity. We define \"minimal\" as the pair with the smallest sum $i+j$ that meets the criterion.\n\nWe systematically search for the minimal generalization by testing combinations of levels in increasing order of $i+j$.\n\n1.  **Level Sum $i+j=0$**: $(i,j)=(0,0)$. This corresponds to using the exact values of $A$ and $Z$. As all pairs of $(A,Z)$ in the provided data are unique, each record forms its own equivalence class of size $1$. This fails the condition $1 \\ge 5$.\n\n2.  **Level Sum $i+j=1$**:\n    -   $(i,j)=(1,0)$: Generalization is $(g_A^1, g_Z^0)$, pairing $5$-year age bins with exact $5$-digit ZIPs. Since all original ZIPs are unique, the generalized quasi-identifier pairs remain unique. All equivalence classes have size $1$, failing the condition.\n    -   $(i,j)=(0,1)$: Generalization is $(g_A^0, g_Z^1)$, pairing exact ages with $3$-digit ZIP prefixes. The two ZIP prefixes are $021$ and $022$. Within the group of records with ZIP prefix $021$, all ages are unique. The same holds for records with ZIP prefix $022$. Thus, all equivalence classes are of size $1$, failing the condition.\n\n3.  **Level Sum $i+j=2$**:\n    -   $(i,j)=(2,0)$: Generalization is $(g_A^2, g_Z^0)$, pairing $10$-year age bins with exact $5$-digit ZIPs. Again, unique ZIPs lead to equivalence classes of size $1$. This fails.\n    -   $(i,j)=(0,2)$: Generalization is $(g_A^0, g_Z^2)$, pairing exact ages with a fully suppressed ZIP code. As all ages in the dataset are unique, equivalence classes are of size $1$. This fails.\n    -   $(i,j)=(1,1)$: Generalization is $(g_A^1, g_Z^1)$, pairing $5$-year age bins with $3$-digit ZIP prefixes. Let's analyze the equivalence classes:\n        -   The quasi-identifier $([20,24], 021)$ groups records with ages $\\{22, 23, 24\\}$, resulting in an equivalence class of size $3$. Since $3  5$, this generalization level is insufficient.\n\n4.  **Level Sum $i+j=3$**: We test the combination $(i,j)=(2,1)$.\n    -   $(i,j)=(2,1)$: Generalization is $(g_A^2, g_Z^1)$, pairing $10$-year age bins with $3$-digit ZIP prefixes. Let's apply this generalization to the dataset.\n        -   The ages $\\{22, 24, 26, 28, 23\\}$ are all in the range $[20,29]$ and have ZIP codes starting with $021$. These $5$ records form the first equivalence class, $EC_1$, with quasi-identifier $([20,29], 021)$. The size is 5.\n        -   The ages $\\{34, 37, 33, 31, 36\\}$ are all in the range $[30,39]$ and have ZIP codes starting with $021$. These $5$ records form the second equivalence class, $EC_2$, with quasi-identifier $([30,39], 021)$. The size is 5.\n        -   The ages $\\{41, 45, 44, 47, 49\\}$ are all in the range $[40,49]$ and have ZIP codes starting with $022$. These $5$ records form the third equivalence class, $EC_3$, with quasi-identifier $([40,49], 022)$. The size is 5.\n        -   The ages $\\{52, 55, 54, 58, 50\\}$ are all in the range $[50,59]$ and have ZIP codes starting with $022$. These $5$ records form the fourth equivalence class, $EC_4$, with quasi-identifier $([50,59], 022)$. The size is 5.\n\n    All four equivalence classes have a size of $5$, thus satisfying the $k=5$ anonymity requirement. Since all generalizations with a lower level sum ($0$, $1$, $2$) failed, the combination of Age Level $2$ and ZIP Level $1$ is the minimal generalization that achieves this.\n\nNext, we compute the distinct $l$-diversity for each equivalence class. The value of $l$ is the number of distinct sensitive values $S$ within a class. The problem specifies the reporting order to be lexicographically by the pair $(\\text{ZIP prefix}, \\text{Age bin})$.\n\n1.  **Class $(021, [20,29])$**: The sensitive values are $\\{\\text{Asthma}, \\text{Depression}, \\text{Asthma}, \\text{Type 1 Diabetes}, \\text{Depression}\\}$. The set of distinct values is $\\{\\text{Asthma}, \\text{Depression}, \\text{Type 1 Diabetes}\\}$.

The set of distinct values is $\\{\\text{Prostate Cancer}, \\text{Chronic Kidney Disease}\\}$.

Hence, the per-record probability of correct identification is\n$$\nR_{\\text{mark}} = \\Pr(U_s) = u_s.\n$$\n\nWe now compute the risks using the provided parameter values. First, compute the sampling fraction:\n$$\nf = \\frac{n}{N} = \\frac{120{,}000}{9{,}600{,}000} = 0.0125.\n$$\nProsecutor risk:\n$$\nR_{\\text{proc}} = u_s = 0.024.\n$$\nJournalist risk:\n$$\nR_{\\text{jour}} = u_p \\cdot f = 0.0075 \\times 0.0125 = 0.00009375.\n$$\nMarketer risk:\n$$\nR_{\\text{mark}} = u_s = 0.024.\n$$\n\nThe worst-case per-record risk across the three models is the maximum of these values:\n$$\nR_{\\max} = \\max\\{R_{\\text{proc}}, R_{\\text{jour}}, R_{\\text{mark}}\\} = \\max\\{0.024,\\; 0.00009375,\\; 0.024\\} = 0.024.\n$$\n\nFinally, round $R_{\\max}$ to $4$ significant figures. The value $0.024$ has two nonzero significant digits; to express $4$ significant figures, we write\n$$\n0.02400.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.02400}$$", "id": "4571040"}]}
