The normalization factor for an undirected graph: $\\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, using standard definitions from graph theory (adjacency matrix, shortest paths, betweenness centrality) in the context of network biology. It is well-posed, with all necessary information provided and no contradictions. The language is objective and precise. The problem is valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution.\n\nThe graph has $4$ nodes, which we label $1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$. From the adjacency matrix $A$, we can determine the edges. Since $A$ is symmetric ($A_{ij} = A_{ji}$) and has zeros on the diagonal ($A_{ii}=0$), it correctly represents a simple, undirected graph. The edges are the pairs $(i,j)$ for which $A_{ij}=1$:\n- $(1,2)$\n- $(1,3)$\n- $(2,3)$\n- $(3,4)$\nThe nodes $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ form a complete subgraph (a $3$-clique or triangle), and node $4$ is connected only to node $3$.\n\nNext, we identify all shortest paths between all distinct pairs of nodes. Since the graph is unweighted, the length of a path is its number of edges. There are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ such pairs.\n\n1.  Pair $(1,2)$: The direct edge $(1,2)$ gives a path $1 \\to 2$ of length $1$. Any other path, such as $1 \\to 3 \\to 2$, is longer. Thus, there is one shortest path. $\\sigma_{12} = 1$. The path is $1 \\to 2$.\n2.  Pair $(1,3)$: The direct edge $(1,3)$ gives a path $1 \\to 3$ of length $1$. Any other path is longer. Thus, there is one shortest path. $\\sigma_{13} = 1$. The path is $1 \\to 3$.\n3.  Pair $(1,4)$: The shortest path is $1 \\to 3 \\to 4$, with length $2$. There are no other paths of length $2$. Thus, there is one shortest path. $\\sigma_{14} = 1$. The path is $1 \\to 3 \\to 4$.\n4.  Pair $(2,3)$: The direct edge $(2,3)$ gives a path $2 \\to 3$ of length $1$. Any other path is longer. Thus, there is one shortest path. $\\sigma_{23} = 1$.

A bridge node, or articulation point, is a node whose removal increases the number of connected components of the graph. Node $3$ is the only articulation point in this graph; its removal disconnects node $4$ from nodes $1$ and $2$. Node $3$ is also the only node in community $C_1$ that has an edge connecting to community $C_2$. Therefore, node $3$ is the unique bridge node.\n\nFinally, we normalize the betweenness centrality of node $3$. The number of nodes is $n=4$. The normalization factor for an undirected graph is:\n$$ \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} = \\frac{(4-1)(4-2)}{2} = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{2} = 3 $$\nThe normalized betweenness centrality $C'_B(v)$ is given by $C'_B(v) = \\frac{C_B(v)}{(n-1)(n-2)/2}$.

This is the positive eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix $A$.\nThe adjacency matrix is given as:\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  1\\\\\n1  0  0\\\\\n1  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix.\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\lambda  1  1\\\\\n1  -\\lambda  0\\\\\n1  0  -\\lambda\n\\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\nExpanding the determinant along the first row:\n$$\n-\\lambda(-\\lambda \\cdot -\\lambda - 0) - 1(1 \\cdot -\\lambda - 0) + 1(1 \\cdot 0 - (-\\lambda) \\cdot 1) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\lambda(\\lambda^2) - (-\\lambda) + \\lambda = 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\lambda^3 + 2\\lambda = 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\lambda(\\lambda^2 - 2) = 0\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda = 0$, $\\lambda = \\sqrt{2}$, and $\\lambda = -\\sqrt{2}$. The largest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{\\max} = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNext, we find the eigenvector $v = (v_1, v_2, v_3)^T$ corresponding to $\\lambda_{\\max} = \\sqrt{2}$ by solving $(A - \\sqrt{2}I)v = 0$.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\sqrt{2}  1  1\\\\\n1  -\\sqrt{2}  0\\\\\n1  0  -\\sqrt{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nv_1\\\\\nv_2\\\\\nv_3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0\\\\\n0\\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives the system of linear equations:\n1. $-\\sqrt{2}v_1 + v_2 + v_3 = 0$\n2. $v_1 - \\sqrt{2}v_2 = 0 \\implies v_1 = \\sqrt{2}v_2$\n3. $v_1 - \\sqrt{2}v_3 = 0 \\implies v_1 = \\sqrt{2}v_3$\nFrom equations $2$ and $3$, we deduce that $v_2 = v_3$. Substituting $v_1 = \\sqrt{2}v_2$ and $v_3 = v_2$ into equation $1$ confirms consistency: $-\\sqrt{2}(\\sqrt{2}v_2) + v_2 + v_2 = -2v_2 + 2v_2 = 0$.\nThe eigenvector is of the form $v = ( \\sqrt{2}v_2, v_2, v_2 )^T$. As required, this eigenvector has all positive components. We can set $v_2=1$ to get a representative eigenvector $v' = (\\sqrt{2}, 1, 1)^T$.\n\nThe problem requires normalization such that $\\|c\\|_2=1$. We normalize $v'$:\n$$\n\\|v'\\|_2 = \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{2})^2 + 1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2+1+1} = \\sqrt{4} = 2\n$$\nThe normalized eigenvector centrality vector $c$ is:\n$$\nc = \\frac{v'}{\\|v'\\|_2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{2} \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, $c_1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, $c_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$, and $c_3 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe ratio $r$ is defined as $r = \\frac{c_1}{c_2}$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nSecond, we compute the degree centrality vector $d$.

The correlation of any vector with a non-zero variance with itself is $1$. The elements of the rank vectors are not all identical, so the variance is non-zero.\nTherefore, the Spearman correlation is $\\rho = 1$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the summary statistic $q$:\n$$\nq = r + \\rho\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values $r = \\sqrt{2}$ and $\\rho = 1$:\n$$\nq = \\sqrt{2} + 1\n$$\nThis is the required simplified exact expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1+\\sqrt{2}}$$", "id": "4589631"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying key nodes, a major goal in network biology is to uncover mesoscale organization, such as functional modules or communities.

The modularity score $Q$ quantifies the quality of a network partition into communities.\n- A value of $Q > 0$ indicates that the density of edges within the proposed communities is higher than what would be expected by random chance (the null model), suggesting a significant community structure.\n- A value of $Q  0$ implies that the density of intra-community edges is lower than expected, meaning the partition is worse than random.\n- A value of $Q=0$ means that the density of intra-community edges is exactly the same as what is expected under the null model.\n\nIn this case, $Q = 0$. This signifies that the proposed partition $g=(1,1,2,2)$ is no better at identifying communities than a random partitioning scheme that preserves the degree sequence. The number of edges falling within the communities is precisely what one would expect by chance.
