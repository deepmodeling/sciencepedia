Consider the global alignment of two protein sequences under an affine gap penalty model and a standard amino acid substitution score framework. The scoring model is defined by the sum of substitution scores from the BLOcks SUbstitution Matrix 62 (BLOSUM62) for aligned residue pairs, and an affine penalty for each gap segment of length $L$ given by $p(L)=g_{o}+g_{e}\\,(L-1)$, where $g_{o}$ is the gap opening penalty and $g_{e}$ is the gap extension penalty per additional residue in the gap.

Report the single numerical optimal alignment score. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The task is to compute the optimal global alignment score between two protein sequences, $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$, using the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix and an affine gap penalty model. The problem is a direct application of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, adapted for affine gap penalties (often implemented as the Gotoh algorithm).\n\nThe given sequences are:\n$S_{1}=\\text{\"ACDEFGHIKLMNP\"}$ (length $n=13$)\n$S_{2}=\\text{\"ACDFFGHIKLMKP\"}$ (length $m=13$)\n\nThe affine gap penalty for a gap of length $L$ is given by $p(L)=g_{o}+g_{e}\\,(L-1)$, where the gap opening penalty is $g_{o}=11$ and the gap extension penalty is $g_{e}=1$. In a maximization framework for alignment scores, these penalties are subtracted from the score. A new gap of length $L=1$ incurs a penalty of $g_o = 11$. Each additional residue in the gap adds a penalty of $g_e = 1$.\n\nA direct comparison of the sequences reveals a high degree of similarity. They are of equal length and differ at only two positions.\n$S_{1}$: A C D E F G H I K L M N P\n$S_{2}$: A C D F F G H I K L M K P\n\nThe differing positions are:\n1.  At index $4$, $S_{1}$ has residue 'E' while $S_{2}$ has 'F'.\n2.  At index $12$, $S_{1}$ has residue 'N' while $S_{2}$ has 'K'.\n\nThe optimal global alignment score is found by determining the alignment path that maximizes the sum of substitution scores minus gap penalties. The decision at each point in the alignment is whether to align two residues (a match or mismatch) or to align a residue with a gap.\n\nLet's analyze the alignment possibilities. A gapless alignment is the most straightforward candidate:\nA C D E F G H I K L M N P\nA C D F F G H I K L M K P\n\nThe score for this alignment is the sum of the substitution scores for each column, derived from the BLOSUM62 matrix.\nThe alternative is to introduce one or more gaps to avoid the low-scoring mismatches, potentially creating higher-scoring pairings elsewhere. We must justify the choice to include or exclude gaps by comparing the score differences.\n\n**Justification for Gap Placement**\n\nThe cost of opening a gap is $g_{o}=11$. This is a substantial penalty. A gap is only energetically favorable if it circumvents a mismatch or a series of mismatches with a total penalty significantly greater than $11$, and simultaneously creates new, high-scoring matches.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the first mismatch region (E vs. F at index 4)**\n    The local segments are $S_1[3..6] = \\text{\"DEFG\"}$ and $S_2[3..6] = \\text{\"DFFG\"}$.\n    -   **No-gap option**: Aligning `E` with `F`. The score contribution from this column is $s(\\text{E},\\text{F})$. From BLOSUM62, $s(\\text{E},\\text{F}) = -3$.\n    -   **Gap option**: Introduce a gap to avoid the `E-F` mismatch. For instance, let's insert a gap in $S_{2}$:\n        ...D E F G...\n        ...D - F F G...\n        This alignment shifts the sequence $S_2$ relative to $S_1$. The section `EFG` from $S_1$ is aligned with `-FFG` from $S_2$.\n        The score change is evaluated by comparing the score of the gapped alignment segment to the non-gapped one.\n        Score(no-gap) for `EFG` vs `FFG`: $s(\\text{E},\\text{F}) + s(\\text{F},\\text{F}) + s(\\text{G},\\text{G}) = -3 + 6 + 6 = 9$.\n        Score(gap in $S_2$) for `EFG` vs `-FFG`: $-g_{o} + s(\\text{F},\\text{F}) + s(\\text{G},\\text{F})$. From BLOSUM62, $s(\\text{G},\\text{F}) = -3$.\n        The score is $-11 + 6 + (-3) = -8$.\n        The gapped alignment is dramatically worse, with a score of $-8$ compared to $9$. Introducing a gap in $S_1$ would yield a similarly unfavorable result. The penalty $g_o=11$ is far too large to be compensated by resolving a mismatch of score $-3$. Thus, accepting the `E-F` mismatch is the optimal choice for this region.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the second mismatch region (N vs. K at index 12)**\n    The local segments are $S_1[11..13] = \\text{\"MNP\"}$ and $S_2[11..13] = \\text{\"MKP\"}$.\n    -   **No-gap option**: Aligning `N` with `K`. The score contribution is $s(\\text{N},\\text{K})$. From BLOSUM62, $s(\\text{N},\\text{K}) = 0$.\n    -   **Gap option**: Introduce a gap. A gap would incur a penalty of at least $g_o = 11$. Since the mismatch `N-K` has a neutral score of $0$, there is no possibility that introducing a gap could lead to a better score. Any gapped alignment would replace a score of $0$ with a penalty of $-11$ (for opening the gap) plus subsequent substitution scores, which cannot possibly result in a net gain. For example, aligning `N` with a gap and `P` with `K`:\n        ...M N - P...\n        ...M - K P...\n        This is invalid. Let's try:\n        ...M N P...\n        ...M - K P...\n        This would score $s(\\text{M},\\text{M}) - g_o + s(\\text{P},\\text{K})$. From BLOSUM62, $s(\\text{P},\\text{K}) = -1$.\n        Score for `MKP` segment: $s(\\text{M,M}) + s(\\text{K,K}) + s(\\text{P,P}) = 5+5+7 = 17$.\n        Original score for `MNP` vs `MKP` is $s(\\text{M,M}) + s(\\text{N,K}) + s(\\text{P,P}) = 5 + 0 + 7 = 12$.\n        Gapped score: $s(\\text{M,M}) - g_o + s(\\text{P,K}) = 5 - 11 - 1 = -7$.\n        This is a substantial decrease from $12$.\n\nBased on this analysis, the optimal global alignment is the one with zero gaps.\n\n**Calculation of the Optimal Score**\n\nThe optimal score is the sum of the substitution scores for the direct, gapless alignment of $S_1$ and $S_2$.\n$$ \\text{Score} = \\sum_{i=1}^{13} s(S_{1}[i], S_{2}[i]) $$\nThe required BLOSUM62 scores are:\n- $s(\\text{A,A}) = 4$\n- $s(\\text{C,C}) = 9$\n- $s(\\text{D,D}) = 6$\n- $s(\\text{E,F}) = -3$ (mismatch)\n- $s(\\text{F,F}) = 6$\n- $s(\\text{G,G}) = 6$\n- $s(\\text{H,H}) = 8$\n- $s(\\text{I,I}) = 4$\n- $s(\\text{K,K}) = 5$\n- $s(\\text{L,L}) = 4$\n- $s(\\text{M,M}) = 5$\n- $s(\\text{N,K}) = 0$ (mismatch)\n- $s(\\text{P,P}) = 7$\n\nThe total score is the sum of these values:\n$\\text{Score} = 4 + 9 + 6 + (-3) + 6 + 6 + 8 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 0 + 7$\nWe can group the scores for identical matches and the mismatches:\nSum of scores for matches: $4 + 9 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 8 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 64$\nSum of scores for mismatches: $-3 + 0 = -3$\nTotal Score = $64 + (-3) = 61$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{61}\n$$", "id": "4601961"}, {"introduction": "In practice, homology modeling often begins with multiple potential templates, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
