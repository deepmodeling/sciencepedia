When the instrument is a simple binary variable, such as the presence or absence of a genetic allele, the general IV formula simplifies into a clear and direct ratio of mean differences. This exercise [@problem_id:4574229] guides you through the process of deriving this fundamental estimator, known as the Wald estimator, from the core IV assumptions and applying it to a practical Mendelian Randomization scenario, providing a solid foundation for understanding how IV analysis translates theory into practice.", "problem": "A large-scale Mendelian randomization study in cardiovascular epidemiology investigates the causal effect of a continuous inflammatory biomarker $X$ (C-reactive protein, measured in mg/L) on a continuous outcome $Y$ (systolic blood pressure, measured in mmHg). A single-nucleotide polymorphism is used as an instrumental variable (IV), and it is coded as a binary instrument $Z \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicating the absence ($Z=0$) or presence ($Z=1$) of the effect allele. Assume a linear structural causal model in which the average causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ is a constant slope parameter $ \\beta $, and that $Z$ may affect $X$ but affects $Y$ only through $X$. Work in a superpopulation framework, and assume that all relevant expectations and variances exist and are finite.\n\nUsing only core definitions of instrumental variable relevance and exogeneity, and without invoking any pre-specified estimating formulas, derive the population ratio form of the just-identified IV estimator based on $Z$ for the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ when $Z$ is binary.

Express the causal effect in units of mmHg per mg/L.\n\nFinally, clearly articulate the minimal high-level conditions, in terms of instrument relevance, exogeneity, structural assumptions, and regularity conditions, under which this estimator is consistent for the causal effect parameter in the described epidemiological setting with a binary instrument and continuous exposure.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the instrumental variable (IV) estimator for a binary instrument, its calculation from sample data, and an articulation of the conditions for its consistency. The context is a Mendelian randomization study where a genetic variant $Z$ is used as an instrument to estimate the causal effect of a biomarker $X$ on a health outcome $Y$.\n\nFirst, we derive the population form of the IV estimator. Let the structural causal model relating the outcome $Y$ to the exposure $X$ be linear with a constant causal effect parameter $\\beta$:\n$$\nY = \\alpha_Y + \\beta X + U\n$$\nwhere $U$ represents all other causes of $Y$, including unmeasured confounders that may be correlated with $X$. The goal is to estimate $\\beta$.\n\nThe instrumental variable $Z$ must satisfy two core conditions:\n1.  **Relevance**: $Z$ must be associated with the exposure $X$. Formally, $\\text{Cov}(Z, X) \\neq 0$.\n2.  **Exogeneity**: $Z$ must be independent of any unmeasured confounders of the $X-Y$ relationship. This is typically operationalized as two sub-conditions: (a) $Z$ affects $Y$ only through $X$ (the exclusion restriction), and (b) $Z$ is independent of $U$. Together, these imply $\\text{Cov}(Z, U) = 0$.\n\nWe take the covariance of the structural equation with the instrument $Z$:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(Y, Z) = \\text{Cov}(\\alpha_Y + \\beta X + U, Z)\n$$\nUsing the linearity property of covariance, this becomes:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(Y, Z) = \\text{Cov}(\\alpha_Y, Z) + \\beta \\text{Cov}(X, Z) + \\text{Cov}(U, Z)\n$$\nSince $\\alpha_Y$ is a constant, $\\text{Cov}(\\alpha_Y, Z) = 0$. From the exogeneity assumption, we have $\\text{Cov}(U, Z) = 0$. This simplifies the equation to:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(Y, Z) = \\beta \\text{Cov}(X, Z)\n$$\nFrom the relevance assumption, $\\text{Cov}(X, Z) \\neq 0$, so we can solve for $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(Y, Z)}{\\text{Cov}(X, Z)}\n$$\nThis is the general form of the population IV estimand. For a binary instrument $Z \\in \\{0,1\\}$, the covariance formula can be simplified. For any random variable $V$, the covariance with a binary $Z$ is $\\text{Cov}(V, Z) = (E[V|Z=1] - E[V|Z=0])P(Z=1)(1-P(Z=1))$. Applying this to the numerator and denominator:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{(E[Y|Z=1] - E[Y|Z=0])P(Z=1)(1-P(Z=1))}{(E[X|Z=1] - E[X|Z=0])P(Z=1)(1-P(Z=1))}\n$$\nAssuming that $Z$ is not a constant, i.e., $0 < P(Z=1) < 1$, the term $P(Z=1)(1-P(Z=1))$ is non-zero and can be cancelled. This yields the specific population ratio form for a binary instrument:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{E[Y|Z=1] - E[Y|Z=0]}{E[X|Z=1] - E[X|Z=0]}\n$$\nThis formula defines the estimand as the ratio of the difference in mean outcome to the difference in mean exposure between the two groups defined by the instrument.\n\nSecond, we form the sample-analog estimator by replacing the population conditional expectations with their sample counterparts—the conditional sample means. The estimator, denoted $\\hat{\\beta}_{IV}$, is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{IV} = \\frac{\\bar{Y}_{1} - \\bar{Y}_{0}}{\\bar{X}_{1} - \\bar{X}_{0}}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{Y}_{1}$ and $\\bar{X}_{1}$ are the sample means of $Y$ and $X$ for the subgroup with $Z=1$, and $\\bar{Y}_{0}$ and $\\bar{X}_{0}$ are the sample means for the subgroup with $Z=0$.\n\nUsing the provided data:\n- $\\bar{Y}_{1} = 129.80$\n- $\\bar{Y}_{0} = 127.43$\n- $\\bar{X}_{1} = 2.91$\n- $\\bar{X}_{0} = 2.28$\n\nWe substitute these values into the estimator formula:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{IV} = \\frac{129.80 - 127.43}{2.91 - 2.28} = \\frac{2.37}{0.63} \\approx 3.7619047...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{IV} \\approx 3.762\n$$\nThe units are mmHg per mg/L.\n\nThird, the minimal high-level conditions for $\\hat{\\beta}_{IV}$ to be a consistent estimator for the causal effect $\\beta$ in this setting are:\n1.  **Instrument Relevance**: The SNP ($Z$) must have a causal effect on C-reactive protein levels ($X$). In the population, this means $E[X|Z=1] \\neq E[X|Z=0]$. A violation of this, or a near-violation (a \"weak instrument\"), would make the estimator biased and highly variable.\n2.  **Instrument Exogeneity (and Exclusion Restriction)**: The SNP ($Z$) must be independent of all unmeasured confounding factors that influence both C-reactive protein ($X$) and systolic blood pressure ($Y$). This implies that (a) the SNP does not affect blood pressure through any pathway that bypasses C-reactive protein (i.e., no horizontal pleiotropy), and that (b) the presence of the SNP is not correlated with other lifestyle or environmental factors that cause high blood pressure. This second part is made plausible by the random assortment of alleles at meiosis.\n3.  **Linearity and Homogeneity**: The problem's premise of a linear structural model with a constant causal effect $\\beta$ is a strong structural assumption. It assumes that the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ is the same for every individual. The IV estimator is consistent for this constant effect $\\beta$ under this assumption. Without this assumption (i.e., with effect heterogeneity), the IV ratio converges to the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE), which is the average effect only among those individuals whose exposure level is affected by the instrument.\n\nThese three conditions, along with standard regularity assumptions (e.g., a random sample from the population and finite moments, as given) and a large sample size, ensure that the sample estimator $\\hat{\\beta}_{IV}$ converges in probability to the true causal parameter $\\beta$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.762}$$", "id": "4574229"}, {"introduction": "While the Wald estimator provides a powerful tool, it often relies on the strong assumption that the causal effect of the exposure is the same for every individual.

The Hausman test is designed for this purpose. It compares an estimator that is consistent under both the null and alternative hypotheses (2SLS) with an estimator that is efficient under the null but inconsistent under the alternative (OLS).\n\n1.  **Hypotheses**:\n    -   Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): $X$ is exogenous, i.e., $\\mathrm{Cov}(X, U) = 0$. Under $H_0$, both OLS and 2SLS are consistent estimators of $\\beta$, but OLS is more efficient (has a smaller variance).\n    -   Alternative Hypothesis ($H_A$): $X$ is endogenous, i.e., $\\mathrm{Cov}(X, U) \\neq 0$. Under $H_A$, OLS is inconsistent, while 2SLS remains consistent (given the IV assumptions hold).\n\n2.  **Test Statistic**: The Hausman test statistic is based on the difference between the two estimators, $\\hat{d} = \\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}} - \\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}$. Under $H_0$, this difference should be close to zero. The formal test statistic is a quadratic form:\n    $$ H = (\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}} - \\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}})^T [\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}} - \\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}})]^{-1} (\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}} - \\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}) $$\n    In this single-regressor case, it simplifies to:\n    $$ H = \\frac{(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}} - \\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}})^2}{\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}} - \\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}})} $$\n    A key insight of the Hausman test is the structure of the variance of the difference. Because $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}$ is the efficient estimator under $H_0$, it can be shown that $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}, \\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}} - \\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}) = 0$. This implies $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}, \\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}}) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}})$.\n    Therefore, the variance of the difference is:\n    $$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}} - \\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}}) + \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}) - 2 \\mathrm{Cov}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}, \\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}}) $$\n    $$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}} - \\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}}) + \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}) - 2 \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}) $$\n    $$ \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}} - \\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}}) - \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}) $$\n    This formula is valid under the assumption of homoskedasticity, which is given in the problem statement. The test statistic is thus:\n    $$ H = \\frac{(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}} - \\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}})^2}{\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}}) - \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}})} $$\n    Under $H_0$, $H$ follows a chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of potentially endogenous regressors, which is $1$ in this case ($\\chi^2_1$).\n\n3.  **Calculation**:\n    -   Difference in estimates: $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}} - \\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}} = 0.45 - 0.30 = 0.15$.\n    -   Estimated variances:\n        -   $\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}) = (\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}))^2 = (0.05)^2 = 0.0025$.\n        -   $\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}}) = (\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}}))^2 = (0.12)^2 = 0.0144$.\n    -   Estimated variance of the difference:\n        -   $\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}} - \\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}) = \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}}) - \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}) = 0.0144 - 0.0025 = 0.0119$.\n    -   Hausman statistic:\n        -   $H = \\frac{(0.15)^2}{0.0119} = \\frac{0.0225}{0.0119} \\approx 1.891$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**:\n    -   The test is to be conducted at the $5\\%$ significance level. The critical value for a $\\chi^2_1$ distribution at $\\alpha = 0.05$ is approximately $3.841$.\n    -   Since our test statistic $H \\approx 1.891$ is less than the critical value $3.841$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis $H_0$.\n    -   There is insufficient statistical evidence at the $5\\%$ level to conclude that alcohol intake ($X$) is an endogenous variable in the outcome equation for log C-reactive protein ($Y$). The difference between the OLS and 2SLS estimates is not statistically significant.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The null hypothesis is that $X$ is exogenous in the outcome equation, so both ordinary least squares and two-stage least squares are consistent and ordinary least squares is efficient. The test compares the difference $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}}-\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}$ to its sampling variability implied by the efficiency ordering under the null. Using the reported standard errors, the test statistic is computed from the difference in variances and compared to a $\\chi^2_1$ reference distribution. At the $5\\%$ level, the exogeneity of $X$ cannot be rejected.**\n-   This option correctly states the null hypothesis and its implications for consistency and efficiency.\n-   It correctly describes the Hausman principle of comparing the two estimators.\n-   It correctly identifies the method for calculating the variance of the difference ($\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}}) - \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}})$) and the correct reference distribution ($\\chi^2_1$).\n-   Its conclusion matches our calculation: since $H \\approx 1.891 < 3.841$, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of exogeneity.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The null hypothesis is that the instrument is relevant. Since the first-stage $F=22>10$, reject the null and conclude there is endogeneity. The appropriate test statistic compares $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}}-\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}$ divided by the sum of their variances, which here yields a large value that exceeds the $\\chi^2_1$ critical value, so $X$ is endogenous.**\n-   The null hypothesis of the Hausman test is exogeneity of $X$, not instrument relevance. The F-statistic tests for relevance, and $F=22$ means the instrument is strong, not that endogeneity exists. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the two separate tests.\n-   The variance of the difference is incorrectly stated as the sum of variances. This would assume the estimators are independent, which they are not.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The null hypothesis is that $\\mathbb{E}[U\\mid Z]=0$, which implies instrument validity. The correct comparison is a $t$-test of $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}}-\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}}$ using the pooled variance $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{2SLS}})+\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\mathrm{OLS}})$. The resulting $t$-statistic is approximately $1.12$, which is significant at $5\\%$, so we reject exogeneity.**\n-   The null hypothesis is misstated. $\\mathbb{E}[U\\mid Z]=0$ is the instrument exogeneity assumption, which is taken as given in order to perform the Hausman test. The test's null is $\\mathrm{Cov}(X,U)=0$.\n-   The test statistic is a $\\chi^2$ statistic, not a $t$-statistic in this formulation.\n-   The variance of the difference is incorrectly given as the sum of variances.\n-   A $t$-statistic of $1.12$ would not be significant at the $5\\%$ level (critical value $\\approx \\pm 1.96$), so the conclusion is also flawed based on its own numbers.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The null hypothesis is that $X$ is endogenous. Because the first-stage is strong, ordinary least squares must be biased. Therefore, two-stage least squares is preferred and we reject the null that $X$ is exogenous without further calculation.**\n-   The null hypothesis for this test is exogeneity, not endogeneity.\n-   A strong first stage ($F=22$) does not imply that OLS is biased. OLS is biased only if $X$ is endogenous. Instrument strength and regressor endogeneity are separate concepts.\n-   It is incorrect to reject exogeneity without a formal test. The point of the Hausman test is to provide a statistical basis for choosing between the efficient OLS and the consistent 2SLS.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "4574244"}]}
