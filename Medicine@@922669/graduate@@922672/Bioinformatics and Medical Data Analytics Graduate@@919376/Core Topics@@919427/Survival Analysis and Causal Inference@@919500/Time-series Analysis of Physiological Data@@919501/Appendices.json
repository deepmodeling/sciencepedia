The period of $s(t)$ is $T_s$, so its Fourier series coefficients, $c_k$, are:\n$$c_k = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\int_{-T_s/2}^{T_s/2} s(t) \\exp(-j 2\\pi k \\frac{t}{T_s}) dt = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\int_{-T_s/2}^{T_s/2} \\delta(t) \\exp(-j 2\\pi k f_s t) dt$$\nUsing the sifting property of the delta function, we find $c_k = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\exp(0) = f_s$. The Fourier series representation of $s(t)$ is:\n$$s(t) = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_s \\exp(j 2\\pi k f_s t)$$\nTaking the Fourier transform term-by-term and using the pair $\\mathcal{F}\\{\\exp(j 2\\pi f_{c} t)\\} = \\delta(f-f_{c})$, we get:\n$$S(f) = f_s \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathcal{F}\\{\\exp(j 2\\pi k f_s t)\\} = f_s \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(f - kf_s)$$\nThis shows the Fourier transform of a Dirac comb in time is a Dirac comb in frequency.\n\nFinally, we perform the convolution $X_s(f) = (X_c * S)(f)$:\n$$X_s(f) = X_c(f) * \\left( f_s \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(f - kf_s) \\right) = f_s \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (X_c(f) * \\delta(f - kf_s))$$\n$$X_s(f) = f_s \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} X_c(f - kf_s)$$\nThis result, the Poisson summation formula, shows that the spectrum of the sampled signal, $X_s(f)$, consists of periodically repeated copies of the original spectrum $X_c(f)$, scaled by $f_s$ and centered at integer multiples of the sampling frequency, $k f_s$.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Observed Baseband Frequency\n\nLet the continuous-time signal be a real sinusoid: $x_c(t) = A \\cos(2\\pi f_0 t + \\phi)$.\nUsing Euler's formula, this is:\n$$x_c(t) = \\frac{A}{2} \\left[ \\exp(j(2\\pi f_0 t + \\phi)) + \\exp(-j(2\\pi f_0 t + \\phi)) \\right]$$\nThe discrete-time sequence $x[n]$ is obtained by sampling at $t = nT_s = n/f_s$:\n$$x[n] = x_c(nT_s) = \\frac{A}{2} \\left[ \\exp(j(2\\pi f_0 \\frac{n}{f_s} + \\phi)) + \\exp(-j(2\\pi f_0 \\frac{n}{f_s} + \\phi)) \\right]$$\nLet the normalized discrete-time frequency be $\\omega_0 = 2\\pi (f_0/f_s)$.

That is, $\\exp(j\\omega n)$ is indistinguishable from $\\exp(j(\\omega + 2\\pi m)n)$ for any integer $m$. This means the analog frequency $f_0$ is indistinguishable from frequencies $f_0 - k f_s$ after sampling.\n\nThe problem asks for the observed frequency $f_{obs}$ in the Nyquist interval $[0, f_s/2]$. This corresponds to finding an integer $k$ that brings the aliased frequency into the principal range $[-f_s/2, f_s/2]$. The observed frequency is the magnitude of this result.\n$$f_{obs} = |f_0 - k f_s|$$\nWe select the integer $k$ that minimizes this magnitude, which is the integer closest to the ratio $f_0/f_s$.

Each of these layer-1 inputs has a receptive field of size $R_1$. The total receptive field of layer 2 is the receptive field of the previous layer plus the additional span gained by the current layer's convolution. The additional span gained by layer $\\ell$ is $(k-1)d_\\ell$.\nThis leads to a recursive relationship: $R_\\ell = R_{\\ell-1} + (k-1)d_\\ell$, with $R_0 = 1$ (for the input itself).

This allows the network to capture fine-grained, high-frequency patterns in the HRV signal, such as those related to Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA).\n2.  **Low-Frequency Patterns:** In deeper layers, the dilation factor grows exponentially. A convolution in a deep layer combines outputs from the previous layer that are very far apart in time. Since each of these previous-layer outputs already summarizes a smaller temporal region, the deep-layer convolution learns relationships between these abstracted patterns over a much larger time scale. This allows the network to capture low-frequency (LF) and very-low-frequency (VLF) components of HRV, reflecting slower autonomic processes.\n3.  **Efficient Receptive Field Growth:** This exponential growth in dilation allows the receptive field to increase exponentially with depth. The TCN can thus achieve a very large receptive field with a modest number of layers, making it computationally efficient for modeling long-term dependencies.\n\nThe stack of dilated convolutions creates a hierarchy of filters, with each layer specializing in a different temporal scale, enabling the network to model short-term and long-term dependencies simultaneously in a feed-forward manner.\n\n### Specialization and Calculation of $L_{\\min}$\n\nWe specialize the receptive field formula for kernel size $k=3$ and geometric dilation $d_\\ell = 2^{\\ell-1}$:\n$$R(L) = 1 + (3-1)\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{L} 2^{\\ell-1} = 1 + 2\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{L} 2^{\\ell-1}$$\nThe summation is a finite geometric series $\\sum_{j=0}^{L-1} 2^j = \\frac{2^L - 1}{2-1} = 2^L - 1$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $R(L)$:\n$$R(L) = 1 + 2(2^L - 1) = 1 + 2^{L+1} - 2 = 2^{L+1} - 1$$\nThis is the specialized formula for the receptive field length.\n\nThe design requires the receptive field to cover at least $T = 300$ seconds.
