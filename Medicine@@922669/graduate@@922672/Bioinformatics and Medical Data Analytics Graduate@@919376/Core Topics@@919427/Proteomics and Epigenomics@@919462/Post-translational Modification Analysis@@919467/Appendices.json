The calculation of a peptide's neutral mass from the sum of its residue masses and the mass of water is a standard procedure. The formula for the mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) of a protonated ion is also fundamental to the field. The provided monoisotopic masses for amino acids, water, a proton, and the phosphate group are standard, high-precision values. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. The language is objective and technical. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three main stages:\n1. Calculation of the neutral monoisotopic mass of the unmodified peptide.\n2. Calculation of the neutral monoisotopic mass of the phosphorylated peptide.\n3. Calculation of the mass-to-charge ratios ($m/z$) for both peptides at charge states $z=2$ and $z=3$.\n\nFirst, we determine the neutral monoisotopic mass of the unmodified peptide, denoted $M_{unmod}$. This is calculated by summing the monoisotopic masses of all constituent amino acid residues and adding the monoisotopic mass of a single water molecule. The addition of the water molecule accounts for the H- and -OH groups that form the N-terminus and C-terminus of the peptide, respectively, which are not accounted for in the residue masses (residue mass = amino acid mass - water mass).\nThe sum of the residue masses, $\\sum M_{residue}$, for the peptide $D V S G T P E Y K$ is:\n$$ \\sum M_{residue} = M_D + M_V + M_S + M_G + M_T + M_P + M_E + M_Y + M_K $$\n$$ \\sum M_{residue} = 115.02694 + 99.06841 + 87.03203 + 57.02146 + 101.04768 + 97.05276 + 129.04259 + 163.06333 + 128.09496 $$\n$$ \\sum M_{residue} = 976.45016 \\, \\text{Da} $$\nThe neutral mass of the unmodified peptide is then:\n$$ M_{unmod} = \\left(\\sum M_{residue}\\right) + M_{H_2O} $$\n$$ M_{unmod} = 976.45016 + 18.01056 = 994.46072 \\, \\text{Da} $$\n\nSecond, we determine the neutral monoisotopic mass of the phosphorylated peptide, denoted $M_{phos\\_peptide}$. This is found by adding the mass of the phosphate group modification to the neutral mass of the unmodified peptide. The problem specifies that phosphorylation adds a mass of $M_{phos} = 79.966331$ Da.\n$$ M_{phos\\_peptide} = M_{unmod} + M_{phos} $$\n$$ M_{phos\\_peptide} = 994.46072 + 79.966331 = 1074.427051 \\, \\text{Da} $$\n\nThird, we calculate the mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) for the protonated precursor ions. For an ion with a neutral mass $M_{neutral}$ and a charge state $z$ resulting from the addition of $z$ protons, the $m/z$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{m}{z} = \\frac{M_{neutral} + z \\cdot M_p}{z} $$\nwhere $M_p = 1.00727646688$ Da is the mass of a proton. We will calculate this for four cases and round each result to $6$ significant figures.\n\nCase 1: Unmodified peptide, charge state $z=2$.\n$$ \\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_{unmod, z=2} = \\frac{M_{unmod} + 2 \\cdot M_p}{2} = \\frac{994.46072 + 2 \\cdot (1.00727646688)}{2} $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_{unmod, z=2} = \\frac{994.46072 + 2.01455293376}{2} = \\frac{996.47527293376}{2} = 498.237636... \\, \\text{Th} $$\nRounding to $6$ significant figures gives $498.238$ Th.\n\nCase 2: Unmodified peptide, charge state $z=3$.\n$$ \\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_{unmod, z=3} = \\frac{M_{unmod} + 3 \\cdot M_p}{3} = \\frac{994.46072 + 3 \\cdot (1.00727646688)}{3} $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_{unmod, z=3} = \\frac{994.46072 + 3.02182940064}{3} = \\frac{997.48254940064}{3} = 332.494183... \\, \\text{Th} $$\nRounding to $6$ significant figures gives $332.494$ Th.\n\nCase 3: Phosphorylated peptide, charge state $z=2$.\n$$ \\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_{phos, z=2} = \\frac{M_{phos\\_peptide} + 2 \\cdot M_p}{2} = \\frac{1074.427051 + 2 \\cdot (1.00727646688)}{2} $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_{phos, z=2} = \\frac{1074.427051 + 2.01455293376}{2} = \\frac{1076.44160393376}{2} = 538.220801... \\, \\text{Th} $$\nRounding to $6$ significant figures gives $538.221$ Th.\n\nCase 4: Phosphorylated peptide, charge state $z=3$.\n$$ \\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_{phos, z=3} = \\frac{M_{phos\\_peptide} + 3 \\cdot M_p}{3} = \\frac{1074.427051 + 3 \\cdot (1.00727646688)}{3} $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{m}{z}\\right)_{phos, z=3} = \\frac{1074.427051 + 3.02182940064}{3} = \\frac{1077.44888040064}{3} = 359.149626... \\, \\text{Th} $$\nRounding to $6$ significant figures gives $359.150$ Th.\n\nThe four calculated $m/z$ values, rounded to $6$ significant figures, are arranged in the specified order to form the final answer.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 498.238 & 332.494 & 538.221 & 359.150 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "4597453"}, {"introduction": "Identifying that a peptide is modified is only half the battle; the true biological function often depends on the precise location of the PTM.

However, a frequent challenge known as \"ratio compression\" arises from the co-isolation of interfering peptides, which can distort the true quantitative ratios. This exercise demonstrates how to apply a mathematical correction to mitigate this interference, enabling you to recover more accurate quantitative measurements and draw more reliable biological conclusions [@problem_id:4597483].", "problem": "A phosphoproteomics experiment uses Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) to quantify a singly phosphorylated peptide across two conditions, denoted condition A and condition B. In Tandem Mass Tags quantification, the reporter ion signal in each channel is proportional to the amount of the tagged peptide and arises from all peptides that were co-isolated and co-fragmented. The following experimentally supported foundations apply:\n\n- In mass spectrometry (MS), under constant instrument settings and negligible detector saturation, the reporter ion intensity is proportional to the amount of material that produced it.\n- When multiple precursors are co-isolated and co-fragmented, the reporter ion intensities in each channel are additive across contributing peptides.\n- Isolation purity reports the fraction of the isolated ion current that originates from the target precursor.\n\nYou are analyzing a spectrum attributed to the phosphopeptide of interest and wish to correct ratio compression due to co-isolation interference using a simple linear interference model consistent with the above foundations. The instrument-reported isolation purity for the target precursor is $\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$, so the co-isolated fraction is $1 - \\alpha = \\frac{1}{3}$. The observed TMT reporter ion intensities for the target-attributed spectrum are $I^{\\mathrm{obs}}_{A} = 8000$ and $I^{\\mathrm{obs}}_{B} = 12000$ (arbitrary MS signal units). An independent interference profiling measurement of the same isolation window (excluding the target contribution) yields an estimate of the aggregate background reporter composition across co-isolated peptides: $B_{A} = 14000$ and $B_{B} = 16000$ in the same units.\n\nAssume a simple interference model in which, in each channel $c \\in \\{A,B\\}$, the observed reporter signal is a convex mixture of the target’s true reporter signal and the aggregate background from co-isolated peptides, with mixture weights given by the isolation purity and co-isolation fractions. Starting from the proportionality and additivity foundations stated above, derive the adjustment needed to estimate the target’s true reporter intensities $I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{A}$ and $I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{B}$ and then compute the corrected true fold change\n$$R^{\\mathrm{true}} = \\frac{I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{B}}{I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{A}}.$$\nProvide the final answer as a unitless decimal number.

It describes a standard interference correction scenario in quantitative proteomics using isobaric tags, relying on a simplified but physically motivated linear model. All necessary parameters are provided, and the objective is clearly defined. Thus, we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks to correct observed Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) reporter ion intensities for co-isolation interference. The core of the problem lies in the \"simple interference model,\" which is stated to be a convex mixture of the target's true signal and the aggregate background signal, weighted by the isolation purity.\n\nLet the two conditions be indexed by $c \\in \\{A, B\\}$. We are given the following quantities:\n- The observed reporter ion intensities, $I^{\\mathrm{obs}}_{A} = 8000$ and $I^{\\mathrm{obs}}_{B} = 12000$.\n- The isolation purity, $\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$. This represents the fraction of the total precursor ion signal in the isolation window that comes from the target peptide.\n- The co-isolated fraction is therefore $1-\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$. This represents the fraction of the total precursor ion signal from interfering, co-isolated peptides.\n- An independent measurement of the aggregate background reporter composition, $B_{A} = 14000$ and $B_{B} = 16000$. These values represent the reporter ion intensities that would be observed if the isolation window contained only the interfering peptides.\n\nWe seek to find the true reporter intensities for the target phosphopeptide, denoted $I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{A}$ and $I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{B}$. These are the intensities that would have been measured if the isolation had been perfectly pure (i.e., if $\\alpha=1$).\n\nThe model states that the observed signal in each channel, $I^{\\mathrm{obs}}_{c}$, is a weighted sum of the true target signal and the background signal. The weights are the purity $\\alpha$ and the co-isolation fraction $1-\\alpha$. This can be expressed as a linear equation for each channel $c$:\n$$I^{\\mathrm{obs}}_{c} = \\alpha I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{c} + (1-\\alpha) B_{c}$$\nThis equation is consistent with the stated foundations: reporter intensity is additive (sum of target and background contributions) and proportional to the amount of material (the precursor ion currents, which are weighted by $\\alpha$ and $1-\\alpha$).\n\nOur goal is to solve for $I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{c}$. We can rearrange the equation algebraically:\n$$\\alpha I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{c} = I^{\\mathrm{obs}}_{c} - (1-\\alpha) B_{c}$$\n$$I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{c} = \\frac{I^{\\mathrm{obs}}_{c} - (1-\\alpha) B_{c}}{\\alpha}$$\nThis is the general formula for the corrected true intensity. Now, we can apply this formula to each channel, $A$ and $B$, using the provided numerical values.\n\nFor channel $A$:\nWe have $I^{\\mathrm{obs}}_{A} = 8000$, $B_{A} = 14000$, and $\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n$$I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{A} = \\frac{8000 - (1-\\frac{2}{3}) \\times 14000}{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\n$$I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{A} = \\frac{8000 - \\frac{1}{3} \\times 14000}{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\n$$I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{A} = \\frac{8000 - \\frac{14000}{3}}{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\nTo simplify, we can find a common denominator for the numerator:\n$$I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{A} = \\frac{\\frac{3 \\times 8000}{3} - \\frac{14000}{3}}{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\n$$I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{A} = \\frac{\\frac{24000 - 14000}{3}}{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\n$$I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{A} = \\frac{\\frac{10000}{3}}{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\n$$I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{A} = \\frac{10000}{2} = 5000$$\n\nFor channel $B$:\nWe have $I^{\\mathrm{obs}}_{B} = 12000$, $B_{B} = 16000$, and $\\alpha = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n$$I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{B} = \\frac{12000 - (1-\\frac{2}{3}) \\times 16000}{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\n$$I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{B} = \\frac{12000 - \\frac{1}{3} \\times 16000}{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\n$$I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{B} = \\frac{12000 - \\frac{16000}{3}}{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\n$$I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{B} = \\frac{\\frac{3 \\times 12000}{3} - \\frac{16000}{3}}{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\n$$I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{B} = \\frac{\\frac{36000 - 16000}{3}}{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\n$$I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{B} = \\frac{\\frac{20000}{3}}{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\n$$I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{B} = \\frac{20000}{2} = 10000$$\n\nSo, the corrected true intensities are $I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{A} = 5000$ and $I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{B} = 10000$.\n\nThe final step is to compute the corrected true fold change, $R^{\\mathrm{true}}$, which is the ratio of the true intensity in condition $B$ to that in condition $A$.\n$$R^{\\mathrm{true}} = \\frac{I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{B}}{I^{\\mathrm{true}}_{A}}$$\n$$R^{\\mathrm{true}} = \\frac{10000}{5000} = 2$$\nThe corrected true fold change is $2$.
