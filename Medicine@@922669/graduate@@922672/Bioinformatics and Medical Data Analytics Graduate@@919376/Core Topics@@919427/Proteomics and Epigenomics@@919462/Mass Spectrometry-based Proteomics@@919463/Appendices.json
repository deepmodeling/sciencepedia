Let a peptide of length $L$ be represented by the sequence of its residues $R_1R_2...R_L$, indexed from the N-terminus ($i=1$) to the C-terminus ($i=L$). The chemical structure of a free amino acid is $\\mathrm{H_2N-CHR-COOH}$, where $R$ is the side chain. When two amino acids form a peptide bond, a molecule of water ($\\mathrm{H_2O}$) is eliminated. Consequently, the mass of an amino acid residue as it exists within a peptide chain, denoted as $m(\\mathrm{AA}_i)$, is the mass of the corresponding free amino acid minus the mass of one water molecule, $m(\\mathrm{H_2O})$. The problem provides these residue masses directly.\n\nTo calculate the neutral mass of any peptide or peptide fragment, we sum the masses of its constituent residues and then add back the mass of one water molecule. This is because the sum of residue masses, $\\sum m(\\mathrm{AA}_i)$, represents a chain of $-\\mathrm{NH-CHR-CO}-$ units, which is missing a terminal hydrogen atom ($\\mathrm{H}$) at the N-terminus and a hydroxyl group ($\\mathrm{OH}$) at the C-terminus compared to a complete, stable peptide molecule. The mass of $\\mathrm{H}$ and $\\mathrm{OH}$ equals the mass of a water molecule, $m(\\mathrm{H_2O})$. Therefore, the neutral monoisotopic mass of a peptide consisting of $k$ residues is given by $(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} m(\\mathrm{AA}_i)) + m(\\mathrm{H_2O})$.\n\nAccording to the standard nomenclature in mass spectrometry, a $y_n$-ion is a C-terminal fragment of a peptide created by cleavage of a peptide bond. A $y_n$-ion is composed of the last $n$ residues from the C-terminus of the original peptide. For a peptide of length $L$, the $y_n$-ion corresponds to the sequence segment $R_{L-n+1}R_{L-n+2}...R_L$.\n\nThis fragment is itself a small peptide of length $n$. Applying the principle described above, the neutral monoisotopic mass of this $y_n$ fragment, which we denote as $m(y_n)_{\\text{neutral}}$, is the sum of the residue masses of its $n$ constituent amino acids plus the mass of one water molecule.\n$$m(y_n)_{\\text{neutral}} = \\left( \\sum_{i=L-n+1}^{L} m(\\mathrm{AA}_i) \\right) + m(\\mathrm{H_2O})$$\n\nIn positive-ion mode Electrospray Ionization (ESI), which is a soft ionization technique commonly used in proteomics, charged ions are typically formed by the adduction of one or more protons ($\\mathrm{H}^+$). The problem specifies a singly charged ion ($z=1$). The mass of a singly charged $y_n$-ion, denoted $m(y_n^+)$, is therefore the neutral mass of the fragment plus the mass of one proton, $m_p$.\n$$m(y_n^+) = m(y_n)_{\\text{neutral}} + m_p$$\nSubstituting the expression for the neutral mass, we arrive at the final analytic expression for the monoisotopic mass of a singly charged $y_n$-ion:\n$$m(y_n^+) = \\left( \\sum_{i=L-n+1}^{L} m(\\mathrm{AA}_i) \\right) + m(\\mathrm{H_2O}) + m_p$$\nFor a singly charged ion where the charge state $z=1$, the mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) is numerically equal to the ion's mass.\n\nPart 2: Calculation for the $y_4$ ion of peptide $\\mathrm{ACDEKTR}$.\n\nThe given peptide sequence is $\\mathrm{A_1C_2D_3E_4K_5T_6R_7}$.\nThe length of the peptide is $L=7$.\nWe are asked to compute the mass of the $y_4$-ion, so $n=4$.\n\nThe $y_4$-ion consists of the C-terminal $4$ residues.

This phenomenon, where the presence of a high-abundance species prevents the detection of a co-isolated low-abundance one by dominating the AGC, is a key aspect of ion suppression and the dynamic range challenge in data-dependent proteomics.\n\nNow, we will evaluate each option.\n\n**A. In the AGC-limited regime with $t^\\star = T/\\phi_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, the low-abundance peptide accrues $N_L = \\phi_L t^\\star \\approx T \\cdot (C_L/C_H)$ ions, which with $C_H/C_L = 10^4$ yields $N_L \\approx 10$ ions, below $N_{\\min}$.

The statement correctly identifies this outcome as a demonstration of ion suppression due to the very short accumulation time forced by the high-abundance peptide, which is a classic dynamic range limitation. The reasoning and calculation are correct.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Increasing the AGC target $T$ by a factor of $10$ in the AGC-limited regime increases $N_L$ by the same factor, potentially pushing $N_L$ above $N_{\\min}$; however, as $N_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ approaches $N_{\\mathrm{cap}}$, space-charge degrades mass accuracy, so dynamic range remains constrained.**\n\nLet the new AGC target be $T' = 10T = 10 \\cdot 10^5 = 10^6$ ions.\nThe new accumulation time would be $t^{\\star\\prime} = T'/\\phi_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{ions} / 10^5\\,\\mathrm{ions/ms} = 10\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.

The new count $N_L' \\approx 100$ ions, which is equal to the detection threshold $N_{\\min}$. So, this strategy could indeed make the peptide detectable.\nThe total number of ions in the analyzer is now $N_{\\mathrm{tot}}' = T' = 10^6$ ions. This is a large number of ions for an Orbitrap C-trap and analyzer. It is a well-established principle that as the total ion population $N_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ increases and approaches the analyzer's capacity $N_{\\mathrm{cap}}$, coulombic repulsion between ions (space-charge effects) becomes significant. These effects lead to degradations in performance, most notably broadening of mass spectral peaks (lower resolution) and systematic shifts in measured mass-to-charge ratios (lower mass accuracy). Therefore, while increasing $T$ boosts sensitivity for low-abundance species, this benefit is ultimately limited by the degradation of data quality for all ions in the packet. The dynamic range is still constrained, but now by the physical ion capacity $N_{\\mathrm{cap}}$ rather than just the shot-noise limit. The statement accurately describes this fundamental trade-off.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Decreasing the maximum injection time $t_{\\max}$ alleviates suppression of the low-abundance peptide by reducing accumulation of the high-abundance peptide more than the low-abundance peptide, thereby improving the relative signal of `P_L` under AGC-limited conditions.**\n\nThe current scenario is explicitly AGC-limited, with $t^\\star = 1\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, which is much less than $t_{\\max} = 50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. The accumulation time is determined by $t^\\star = \\min\\{t_{\\max}, T/\\phi_{\\mathrm{tot}}\\}$.\nDecreasing $t_{\\max}$ to any value greater than $t^\\star = 1\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ (e.g., to $t_{\\max, new} = 25\\,\\mathrm{ms}$) will have no effect on the actual accumulation time, which will remain $1\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\nIf $t_{\\max}$ were decreased to become the limiting factor (i.e., $t_{\\max, new} < 1\\,\\mathrm{ms}$), the accumulation time for both peptides would be reduced equally. The number of ions for both `P_H` and `P_L` would decrease proportionally, making `P_L` even less detectable.\nThe relative abundance of the accumulated ions, $N_L / N_{\\mathrm{tot}} = N_L / (N_L + N_H)$, is determined by the flux ratio $\\phi_L / \\phi_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, and is independent of the accumulation time $t^\\star$ as long as $t^\\star$ is the same for both co-accumulated species. Therefore, changing $t_{\\max}$ cannot improve the relative signal of `P_L`. The statement is physically incorrect.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Narrowing the isolation window to exclude `P_H` removes $\\phi_H$ from $\\phi_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, causing $t^\\star \\approx \\min\\{t_{\\max}, T/\\phi_L\\}$ and allowing $N_L$ to increase up to $\\approx T$ if $t_{\\max}$ is not limiting; this mitigates AGC-driven suppression of `P_L` and extends the effective dynamic range for `P_L`.**\n\nIf the isolation window is narrowed to selectively capture only `P_L`, the ion flux entering the C-trap becomes $\\phi'_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\phi_L$.\nWe can calculate $\\phi_L$ from the initial conditions: $\\phi_L = \\phi_{\\mathrm{tot}} / 10001 = (10^5\\,\\mathrm{ions/ms})/10001 \\approx 9.999\\,\\mathrm{ions/ms}$.\nThe new accumulation time $t^{\\star\\prime}$ will be:\n$$ t^{\\star\\prime} = \\min\\left\\{t_{\\max}, \\frac{T}{\\phi_L}\\right\\} $$\nLet's calculate the time required to reach the AGC target:\n$$ \\frac{T}{\\phi_L} \\approx \\frac{10^5\\,\\mathrm{ions}}{10\\,\\mathrm{ions/ms}} = 10000\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 10\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nSince $t_{\\max} = 50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, the minimum of the two is $50\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n$$ t^{\\star\\prime} = \\min\\{50\\,\\mathrm{ms}, 10000\\,\\mathrm{ms}\\} = 50\\,\\mathrm{ms} $$\nThe accumulation becomes limited by the maximum injection time. The number of ions of `P_L` accumulated is:\n$$ N_L' = \\phi_L \\cdot t^{\\star\\prime} \\approx (10\\,\\mathrm{ions/ms}) \\cdot (50\\,\\mathrm{ms}) = 500\\,\\mathrm{ions} $$\nThis new count $N_L' = 500$ ions is well above the detection threshold $N_{\\min} = 100$ ions. The statement correctly points out that if $t_{\\max}$ were not limiting (i.e., if $t_{\\max} > 10\\,\\mathrm{s}$), the number of ions would accumulate to the target $T = 10^5$. By removing the dominant interfering ion, the system allows for a much longer accumulation time, enabling sufficient signal for the low-abundance peptide to be detected. This correctly describes a powerful strategy to mitigate suppression and extend the practical dynamic range of the measurement.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "4581584"}]}
