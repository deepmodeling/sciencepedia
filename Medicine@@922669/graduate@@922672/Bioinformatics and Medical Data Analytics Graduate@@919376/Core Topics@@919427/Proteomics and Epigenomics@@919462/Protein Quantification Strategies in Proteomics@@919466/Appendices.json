The underlying principles—that detector response is approximately linear and that TIC can serve as a proxy for the total amount of ionizable material analyzed—are foundational assumptions in this type of data analysis. The problem is scientifically sound within the context of an idealized model of LC-MS/MS data.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

It is based on a valid scientific premise, is mathematically formalizable, and is complete and internally consistent. The values provided are realistic for LC-MS/MS experiments.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe fundamental assumption stated in the problem is that the intensity of a given peptide is directly proportional to the Total Ion Current (TIC) of the run, provided the peptide's relative abundance remains constant. This implies that the ratio of a peptide's intensity to the total ion current is an invariant quantity between the two runs.\n\nLet $I_1$ and $I_2$ be the intensities of the peptide in run $1$ and run $2$, respectively. Let $TIC_1$ and $TIC_2$ be the Total Ion Currents for run $1$ and run $2$, respectively. The proportional relationship can be expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{I_1}{TIC_1} = \\frac{I_2}{TIC_2} $$\nThis equation states that the normalized intensity of the peptide is constant across the runs. Our objective is to find the expected intensity in the second run, $I_2$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $I_2$:\n$$ I_2 = I_1 \\times \\frac{TIC_2}{TIC_1} $$\nThis equation shows that the expected intensity in the second run is the intensity from the first run scaled by the ratio of the two TICs.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this equation:\n-   $I_1 = 3.0 \\times 10^{6}$\n-   $TIC_1 = 1.2 \\times 10^{9}$\n-   $TIC_2 = 9.0 \\times 10^{8}$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$ I_2 = (3.0 \\times 10^{6}) \\times \\frac{9.0 \\times 10^{8}}{1.2 \\times 10^{9}} $$\nThe ratio of the TICs can be simplified:\n$$ \\frac{9.0 \\times 10^{8}}{1.2 \\times 10^{9}} = \\frac{9.0}{1.2 \\times 10^{1}} = \\frac{9.0}{12} = 0.75 $$\nThe scaling factor is $0.75$. This is a unitless quantity, as expected.\n\nSubstituting this factor back into the equation for $I_2$:\n$$ I_2 = (3.0 \\times 10^{6}) \\times 0.75 $$\n$$ I_2 = 2.25 \\times 10^{6} $$\nThe calculated intensity is $2.25 \\times 10^{6}$ AIU.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The input values $I_1 = 3.0 \\times 10^{6}$, $TIC_1 = 1.2 \\times 10^{9}$, and $TIC_2 = 9.0 \\times 10^{8}$ each have two significant figures. Therefore, the result of the multiplication and division must also be reported with two significant figures.\n\nRounding the value $2.25 \\times 10^{6}$ to two significant figures gives $2.3 \\times 10^{6}$. The digit in the third significant place is $5$, so we round up the preceding digit.\n\nThus, the expected intensity of the peptide in the second run is $2.3 \\times 10^{6}$ AIU.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.3 \\times 10^{6}}$$", "id": "4601043"}, {"introduction": "Once peptide intensities are normalized, the next challenge is to summarize this information to estimate the abundance of their parent proteins.

Top3 Estimator ($E_{Top3}$)**\n\nThe Top3 method uses the three most intense proteotypic peptides. Based on the additivity assumption, this estimator is the sum of the intensities of these three peptides. First, we identify the three highest intensities from the set $I$. By inspection, these are $2.1 \\times 10^{6}$, $1.9 \\times 10^{6}$, and $1.5 \\times 10^{6}$.\n\nThe Top3 estimator, $E_{Top3}$, is therefore the sum of these values:\n$$\nE_{Top3} = (2.1 \\times 10^{6}) + (1.9 \\times 10^{6}) + (1.5 \\times 10^{6})\n$$\n$$\nE_{Top3} = (2.1 + 1.9 + 1.5) \\times 10^{6}\n$$\n$$\nE_{Top3} = 5.5 \\times 10^{6}\n$$\n\n**2. Intensity-Based Absolute Quantification (iBAQ) Estimator ($E_{iBAQ}$)**\n\nThe iBAQ method, as defined in the problem, normalizes the summed peptide intensities by the number of theoretically observable proteotypic peptides. This means we sum all measured intensities and divide by $N_{obs}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of all measured intensities, $\\sum I_i$:\n$$\n\\sum I_i = (2.1 \\times 10^{6}) + (1.9 \\times 10^{6}) + (1.5 \\times 10^{6}) + (0.9 \\times 10^{6})\n$$\n$$\n\\sum I_i = (2.1 + 1.9 + 1.5 + 0.9) \\times 10^{6}\n$$\n$$\n\\sum I_i = 6.4 \\times 10^{6}\n$$\n\nThe iBAQ estimator, $E_{iBAQ}$, is this sum divided by $N_{obs}$:\n$$\nE_{iBAQ} = \\frac{\\sum I_i}{N_{obs}} = \\frac{6.4 \\times 10^{6}}{8}\n$$\n$$\nE_{iBAQ} = 0.8 \\times 10^{6}\n$$\n\n**3.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. A rigorous and unique solution can be derived. Proceeding to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the application of the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) procedure to control the false discovery rate (FDR) for a set of $p$-values from multiple hypothesis tests.\n\nThe total number of hypotheses (proteins) being tested is $m=5$. The set of observed $p$-values is $P = \\{0.001, 0.02, 0.04, 0.15, 0.5\\}$. The desired FDR control level is $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\nThe BH procedure consists of the following steps:\n1.  Order the $m$ $p$-values from smallest to largest: $p_{(1)} \\le p_{(2)} \\le \\dots \\le p_{(m)}$.\n2.  Find the largest rank $k$ such that its corresponding $p$-value, $p_{(k)}$, satisfies the condition $p_{(k)} \\le \\frac{k}{m} \\alpha$.\n3.  Reject all null hypotheses $H_{(i)}$ for $i=1, \\dots, k$. The number of discoveries is $k$.\n\nLet's apply this procedure.\nFirst, we sort the given $p$-values in ascending order and assign their ranks, from $i=1$ to $m=5$:\n-   $p_{(1)} = 0.001$\n-   $p_{(2)} = 0.02$\n-   $p_{(3)} = 0.04$\n-   $p_{(4)} = 0.15$\n-   $p_{(5)} = 0.5$\n\nNext, for each rank $i$, we calculate the BH threshold, $\\frac{i}{m} \\alpha$, and check if $p_{(i)}$ is less than or equal to this threshold. Here, $m=5$ and $\\alpha=0.05$, so the threshold is $\\frac{i}{5}(0.05) = i \\times 0.01$.\n\n-   For $i=1$: Threshold is $1 \\times 0.01 = 0.01$. We check if $p_{(1)} \\le 0.01$. Since $0.001 \\le 0.01$, the condition holds.\n-   For $i=2$: Threshold is $2 \\times 0.01 = 0.02$. We check if $p_{(2)} \\le 0.02$. Since $0.02 \\le 0.02$, the condition holds.\n-   For $i=3$: Threshold is $3 \\times 0.01 = 0.03$. We check if $p_{(3)} \\le 0.03$. Since $0.04 > 0.03$, the condition fails.\n-   For $i=4$: Threshold is $4 \\times 0.01 = 0.04$. Since we have already found a rank for which the condition fails, and the $p$-values are increasing, subsequent tests will also fail. However, for completeness: $0.15 > 0.04$, so the condition fails.\n-   For $i=5$: Threshold is $5 \\times 0.01 = 0.05$. We check if $p_{(5)} \\le 0.05$. Since $0.5 > 0.05$, the condition fails.\n\nThe largest rank $k$ for which the condition $p_{(k)} \\le \\frac{k}{m} \\alpha$ is met is $k=2$. According to the BH procedure, we reject the null hypotheses corresponding to the $p$-values $p_{(1)}$ and $p_{(2)}$. Therefore, the number of discoveries is $2$.\n\nThe problem also asks to derive the adjusted $p$-values, known as $q$-values. The $q$-value for the $i$-th ordered $p$-value is defined as:\n$$q_{(i)} = \\min_{j=i, \\dots, m} \\left( \\frac{m}{j} p_{(j)} \\right)$$\nThis definition ensures that the resulting $q$-values are monotonically non-decreasing, i.e., $q_{(1)} \\le q_{(2)} \\le \\dots \\le q_{(m)}$. A more direct way to calculate them is to first compute the raw value $p'_{(i)} = \\frac{m}{i} p_{(i)}$ for each $i$, and then enforce monotonicity by setting $q_{(i)} = p'_{(i)}$ for $i=m$ and $q_{(i)} = \\min(p'_{(i)}, q_{(i+1)})$ for $i = m-1, \\dots, 1$.\n\nLet's compute the raw values $\\frac{m}{i}p_{(i)}$:\n-   For $i=1$: $\\frac{5}{1} p_{(1)} = 5 \\times 0.001 = 0.005$\n-   For $i=2$: $\\frac{5}{2} p_{(2)} = 2.5 \\times 0.02 = 0.05$\n-   For $i=3$: $\\frac{5}{3} p_{(3)} = \\frac{5}{3} \\times 0.04 = \\frac{0.2}{3} \\approx 0.0667$\n-   For $i=4$: $\\frac{5}{4} p_{(4)} = 1.25 \\times 0.15 = 0.1875$\n-   For $i=5$: $\\frac{5}{5} p_{(5)} = 1 \\times 0.5 = 0.5$\n\nNow we enforce monotonicity to obtain the final $q$-values, starting from $i=5$ and moving backward to $i=1$:\n-   $q_{(5)} = \\frac{5}{5} p_{(5)} = 0.5$\n-   $q_{(4)} = \\min\\left( \\frac{5}{4} p_{(4)}, q_{(5)} \\right) = \\min(0.1875, 0.5) = 0.1875$\n-   $q_{(3)} = \\min\\left( \\frac{5}{3} p_{(3)}, q_{(4)} \\right) = \\min\\left( \\frac{0.2}{3}, 0.1875 \\right) = \\frac{0.2}{3}$\n-   $q_{(2)} = \\min\\left( \\frac{5}{2} p_{(2)}, q_{(3)} \\right) = \\min\\left( 0.05, \\frac{0.2}{3} \\right) = 0.05$\n-   $q_{(1)} = \\min\\left( \\frac{5}{1} p_{(1)}, q_{(2)} \\right) = \\min(0.005, 0.05) = 0.005$\n\nThe set of ordered $q$-values is $\\{0.005, 0.05, \\frac{0.2}{3}, 0.1875, 0.5\\}$.\nAn equivalent way to determine discoveries is to find all hypotheses for which $q_{(i)} \\le \\alpha$.\n-   $q_{(1)} = 0.005 \\le 0.05$ (Discovery)\n-   $q_{(2)} = 0.05 \\le 0.05$ (Discovery)\n-   $q_{(3)} = \\frac{0.2}{3} \\approx 0.0667 > 0.05$ (Not a discovery)\n-   $q_{(4)} = 0.1875 > 0.05$ (Not a discovery)\n-   $q_{(5)} = 0.5 > 0.05$ (Not a discovery)\n\nBoth methods confirm that there are $2$ discoveries at an FDR level of $\\alpha = 0.05$.
