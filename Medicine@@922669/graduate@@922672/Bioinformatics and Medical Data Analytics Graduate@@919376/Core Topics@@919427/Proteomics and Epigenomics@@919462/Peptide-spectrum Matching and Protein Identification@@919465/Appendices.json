A peptide of length $n$ is formed from $n$ individual amino acids. The formation of the peptide involves the creation of $n-1$ peptide bonds, and as stated in fact (i), each bond formation results in the elimination of one molecule of water.\n\nLet $M(\\text{AA}_i)$ be the monoisotopic mass of the $i$-th free amino acid in the sequence. Let $m(\\mathrm{H_{2}O})$ be the monoisotopic mass of a water molecule. For a peptide $P$ of length $n$, the total mass is the sum of the masses of its constituent amino acids minus the mass of the water molecules lost during polymerization.\nThe general formula for the mass of the peptide chain, $M(P)$, is:\n$$\nM(P) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} M(\\text{AA}_i) \\right) - (n-1) \\cdot m(\\mathrm{H_{2}O})\n$$\nThe problem provides a definition for the \"monoisotopic residue mass,\" denoted $m(\\text{X})$ for an amino acid X.

This can be expressed as:\n$$\nm(\\text{X}) = M(\\text{AA}_{\\text{X}}) - m(\\mathrm{H_{2}O})\n$$\nThis implies that the mass of a free amino acid can be expressed in terms of its residue mass:\n$$\nM(\\text{AA}_{\\text{X}}) = m(\\text{X}) + m(\\mathrm{H_{2}O})\n$$\nWe can substitute this expression back into the general formula for the peptide mass $M(P)$:\n$$\nM(P) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} [m(\\text{AA}_i) + m(\\mathrm{H_{2}O})] \\right) - (n-1) \\cdot m(\\mathrm{H_{2}O})\n$$\nExpanding the summation:\n$$\nM(P) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} m(\\text{AA}_i) \\right) + n \\cdot m(\\mathrm{H_{2}O}) - (n-1) \\cdot m(\\mathrm{H_{2}O})\n$$\nCombining the terms involving $m(\\mathrm{H_{2}O})$:\n$$\nM(P) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} m(\\text{AA}_i) \\right) + (n - (n-1)) \\cdot m(\\mathrm{H_{2}O})\n$$\n$$\nM(P) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} m(\\text{AA}_i) \\right) + m(\\mathrm{H_{2}O})\n$$\nThis derived formula states that the neutral monoisotopic mass of a peptide is the sum of the monoisotopic residue masses of its constituent amino acids plus the mass of a single water molecule.
