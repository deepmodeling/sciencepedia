The given posterior error probability is $q_i = \\Pr(I_i = 1 \\mid \\text{data}) = E[I_i \\mid \\text{data}]$.\n\nThe number of incorrect columns in the set $S$ is $V(S) = \\sum_{i \\in S} I_i$. The problem states that the expected number of incorrect selections in $S$ is the sum of their posterior error probabilities. Using the linearity of expectation, this is:\n$$\nE[V(S) \\mid \\text{data}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i \\in S} I_i \\mid \\text{data}\\right] = \\sum_{i \\in S} E[I_i \\mid \\text{data}] = \\sum_{i \\in S} q_i\n$$\nThis confirms the problem's provided definition.\n\nThe problem defines the FDR as the \"expected proportion of incorrect selections among all selections.\" For a fixed set of selections $S$, this can be formulated as the posterior expected FDR (also known as the local FDR or q-value of the set), which is the expected number of incorrect selections divided by the total number of selections:\n$$\n\\text{FDR}(S) = \\frac{E[V(S) \\mid \\text{data}]}{|S|} = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in S} q_i}{|S|}\n$$\nWe are tasked with finding a set $S$ that maximizes $|S|$ subject to the constraint $\\text{FDR}(S) \\le \\alpha$.\n\nTo maximize the size of $S$ while keeping the average $q_i$ value low, we should preferentially include columns with the smallest posterior error probabilities $q_i$. This suggests a procedure based on sorting the PEPs.\n\nLet the sorted PEPs be $q_{(1)} \\le q_{(2)} \\le \\dots \\le q_{(n)}$. Let the set of the $k$ columns with the lowest PEPs be $S_k$. The posterior expected FDR for this set is:\n$$\n\\text{FDR}(S_k) = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{j=1}^k q_{(j)}\n$$\nWe want to find the largest set, which corresponds to finding the largest value of $k$ that satisfies the FDR constraint. Let this value be $k_{\\max}$.\n$$\nk_{\\max} = \\max \\left\\{ k \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\} \\mid \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{j=1}^k q_{(j)} \\le \\alpha \\right\\}\n$$\nIf no such $k$ exists, the resulting set is empty. Otherwise, the final retained set is $S = S_{k_{\\max}}$, which contains the $k_{\\max}$ columns with the lowest PEPs. This procedure guarantees that we retain the maximum number of columns for the given FDR constraint.\n\n### Application to the Given Data\n\nFirst, we calculate the posterior error probabilities $q_i = 1 - c_i$ for each of the $n=12$ columns.\nThe given confidence values are:\n$\\{c_i\\} = \\{0.55, 0.97, 0.90, 0.40, 0.99, 0.85, 0.70, 0.95, 0.50, 0.60, 0.92, 0.80\\}$.\nThe corresponding PEPs are:\n$\\{q_i\\} = \\{0.45, 0.03, 0.10, 0.60, 0.01, 0.15, 0.30, 0.05, 0.50, 0.40, 0.08, 0.20\\}$.\n\nNext, we sort the PEPs in non-decreasing order. We keep track of the original index, the sorted PEP $q_{(j)}$, the cumulative sum of sorted PEPs $\\sum_{l=1}^j q_{(l)}$, and the corresponding FDR for the set of the top $j$ columns, with $\\alpha = 0.10$.\n\n| Rank $j$ | Original Index $i$ | Sorted PEP $q_{(j)}$ | Cumulative PEP $\\sum_{l=1}^j q_{(l)}$ | FDR = $\\frac{1}{j}\\sum q_{(l)}$ | FDR $\\le 0.10$? |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $1$ | $5$ | $0.01$ | $0.01$ | $0.0100$         | Yes |\n| $2$ | $2$ | $0.03$ | $0.04$ | $0.0200$         | Yes |\n| $3$ | $8$ | $0.05$ | $0.09$ | $0.0300$         | Yes |\n| $4$ | $11$| $0.08$ | $0.17$ | $0.0425$         | Yes |\n| $5$ | $3$ | $0.10$ | $0.27$ | $0.0540$         | Yes |\n| $6$ | $6$ | $0.15$ | $0.42$ | $0.0700$         | Yes |\n| $7$ | $12$| $0.20$ | $0.62$ | $0.0886$ (approx) | Yes |\n| $8$ | $7$ | $0.30$ | $0.92$ | $0.1150$         | No  |\n| $9$ | $10$| $0.40$ | $1.32$ | $0.1467$ (approx) | No  |\n| $10$| $1$ | $0.45$ | $1.77$ | $0.1770$         | No  |\n| $11$| $9$ | $0.50$ | $2.27$ | $0.2064$ (approx) | No  |\n| $12$| $4$ | $0.60$ | $2.87$ | $0.2392$ (approx) | No  |\n\nThe largest rank $k$ for which the FDR condition is met is $k_{\\max} = 7$.\nTherefore, the retained set $S$ consists of the $7$ columns with the lowest PEPs. The original indices of these columns are $\\{5, 2, 8, 11, 3, 6, 12\\}$.\n\n### Calculation of Retained Effective Alignment Length\n\nThe retained effective alignment length $L_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the sum of the confidence values $c_i$ for the columns in the retained set $S$.\nThe columns in $S$ correspond to original indices $i \\in \\{2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12\\}$.\nThe corresponding confidence values $c_i$ are:\n- $c_2 = 0.97$\n- $c_3 = 0.90$\n- $c_5 = 0.99$\n- $c_6 = 0.85$\n- $c_8 = 0.95$\n- $c_{11} = 0.92$\n- $c_{12} = 0.80$\n\nWe sum these values:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sum_{i \\in S} c_i = 0.97 + 0.90 + 0.99 + 0.85 + 0.95 + 0.92 + 0.80\n$$\nAn alternative way to calculate this sum is using the PEPs:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sum_{i \\in S} (1-q_i) = |S| - \\sum_{i \\in S} q_i\n$$\nFrom the table, $|S| = k_{\\max} = 7$, and the sum of the PEPs for these columns is the cumulative sum at rank $7$, which is $0.62$.\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 7 - 0.62 = 6.38\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The value $6.38$ can be written as $6.380$ to express this precision.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.380}$$", "id": "4540435"}]}
