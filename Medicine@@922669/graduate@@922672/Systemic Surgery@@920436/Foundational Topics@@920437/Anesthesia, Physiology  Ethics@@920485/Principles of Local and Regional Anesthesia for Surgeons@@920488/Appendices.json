The analysis will proceed from the foundational definitions provided.\n\nFirst, we determine the mass concentration in units of milligrams per milliliter (mg/mL). The problem states that an $x\\%$ w/v solution contains $x$ grams of solute per $100$ mL of solution. For the given bupivacaine solution, the concentration is $0.5\\%$ w/v. Applying the definition, this corresponds to a mass $m$ of $0.5$ grams of bupivacaine per a volume $V_{ref}$ of $100$ mL.\n$$ \\text{Concentration (w/v)} = \\frac{0.5 \\text{ g}}{100 \\text{ mL}} $$\nTo express this concentration in mg/mL, we use the provided conversion factor, $1 \\text{ g} = 1000 \\text{ mg}$. The mass of bupivacaine in milligrams is:\n$$ m_{mg} = 0.5 \\text{ g} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ mg}}{1 \\text{ g}} = 500 \\text{ mg} $$\nThus, the concentration $C$ in mg/mL is the mass in milligrams divided by the volume in milliliters:\n$$ C = \\frac{500 \\text{ mg}}{100 \\text{ mL}} = 5 \\text{ mg/mL} $$\n\nSecond, we compute the total mass of bupivacaine, $m_{delivered}$, to be administered. The planned injection volume is $V_{inj} = 25$ mL. The total mass is the product of the concentration and the volume:\n$$ m_{delivered} = C \\times V_{inj} $$\nSubstituting the derived concentration and the given volume:\n$$ m_{delivered} = 5 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}} \\times 25 \\text{ mL} = 125 \\text{ mg} $$\nThis is the total mass of bupivacaine that will be delivered to the patient.\n\nThird, we must verify whether this delivered mass lies within the recommended safe dosage range for the patient.

The recommended maximum dose range for bupivacaine without vasoconstrictor is specified as $d_{range} = [2.5 \\text{ mg/kg}, 3.0 \\text{ mg/kg}]$.\n\nWe calculate the minimum and maximum acceptable total mass for this specific patient.\nThe minimum recommended mass, $m_{min}$, is:\n$$ m_{min} = 2.5 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} \\times 60 \\text{ kg} = 150 \\text{ mg} $$\nThe maximum recommended mass, $m_{max}$, is:\n$$ m_{max} = 3.0 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} \\times 60 \\text{ kg} = 180 \\text{ mg} $$\nThe recommended dosage range for this $60$ kg patient is therefore between $150$ mg and $180$ mg, inclusive.\n\nThe verification step consists of comparing the delivered mass, $m_{delivered} = 125$ mg, with this range, $[150 \\text{ mg}, 180 \\text{ mg}]$. Since $125  150$, the calculated delivered mass of $125$ mg is below the lower boundary of the recommended range.

The first-principles definition is:\n$$V_d = \\frac{\\text{Amount of drug in body}}{\\text{Plasma concentration}}$$\nTo find the peak plasma concentration, $C_{p, peak}$, we rearrange this formula. The \"Amount of drug in body\" at any time is the administered dose, $M_{injected}$, corrected for its systemic bioavailability, $F$.\n$$C_{p, peak} = \\frac{F \\times M_{injected}}{V_{d, total}}$$\nThe problem specifies an injected dose of $M_{injected} = 400$ $\\mathrm{mg}$. For a conservative peak estimate due to the high vascularity of intercostal injections, we are instructed to assume a bioavailability of $F = 1$. The specific apparent volume of distribution for lidocaine is given as $V_{d, spec} = 1.3$ $\\mathrm{L/kg}$. We must first calculate the patient's total volume of distribution, $V_{d, total}$:\n$$V_{d, total} = V_{d, spec} \\times m_{patient} = 1.3 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{kg}} \\times 70 \\, \\mathrm{kg} = 91 \\, \\mathrm{L}$$\nNow, we can substitute these values into the equation for the peak plasma concentration:\n$$C_{p, peak} = \\frac{1 \\times 400 \\, \\mathrm{mg}}{91 \\, \\mathrm{L}} \\approx 4.39560439... \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}}$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to three significant figures.

Using these assumptions, determine the predicted ratio of onset times $t_{7.4}/t_{7.6}$.

It is based on established principles of acid-base chemistry and pharmacology. All necessary data and simplifying assumptions are provided to derive a unique, meaningful solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a full solution follows.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the unionized fraction of a weak base and its application to predict the change in onset time for the local anesthetic ropivacaine when the local tissue $pH$ is altered.\n\nLet the weak base be denoted by $B$. In an aqueous solution, it exists in equilibrium with its protonated, conjugate acid form, $BH^+$. The relevant chemical equilibrium is the dissociation of the conjugate acid:\n$$BH^+ \\rightleftharpoons B + H^+$$\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, for this equilibrium is defined by the concentrations of the species at equilibrium:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[B][H^+]}{[BH^+]}$$\nwhere $[B]$ is the concentration of the unionized base, $[BH^+]$ is the concentration of the ionized conjugate acid, and $[H^+]$ is the proton concentration.\n\nThe definitions of $pK_a$ and $pH$ are:\n$$pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$$\n$$pH = -\\log_{10}([H^+])$$\nFrom these definitions, it follows that $K_a = 10^{-pK_a}$ and $[H^+] = 10^{-pH}$.\n\nRearranging the expression for $K_a$ gives the ratio of the un-ionized base to the ionized acid:\n$$\\frac{[B]}{[BH^+]} = \\frac{K_a}{[H^+]}$$\nSubstituting the exponential forms for $K_a$ and $[H^+]$:\n$$\\frac{[B]}{[BH^+]} = \\frac{10^{-pK_a}}{10^{-pH}} = 10^{pH - pK_a}$$\nThis relationship is a form of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.\n\nThe fraction of the drug in its unionized form, $f_{\\text{unionized}}$, is the concentration of the unionized base divided by the total concentration of the drug, which is the sum of the ionized and unionized forms:\n$$f_{\\text{unionized}} = \\frac{[B]}{[B] + [BH^+]}$$\nTo express this fraction in terms of $pH$ and $pK_a$, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by $[B]$:\n$$f_{\\text{unionized}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[BH^+]}{[B]}}$$\nFrom our earlier rearrangement of the $K_a$ expression, we have $\\frac{[BH^+]}{[B]} = \\frac{[H^+]}{K_a} = 10^{pK_a - pH}$. Substituting this into the equation for $f_{\\text{unionized}}$ yields the desired general expression:\n$$f_{\\text{unionized}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH}}$$\n\nNow, we apply this formula to ropivacaine, which has a $pK_a = 8.1$.\nFirst, we compute the unionized fraction at the initial tissue $pH$ of $7.4$. Let this be $f_{7.4}$.\n$$f_{7.4} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{8.1 - 7.4}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{0.7}}$$\nNext, we compute the unionized fraction at the alkalinized tissue $pH$ of $7.6$.

Since only the unionized form, $B$, crosses the lipid membrane, Fick's first law of diffusion states that the flux $J$ is proportional to the concentration gradient of $B$. Assuming the gradient is proportional to the available concentration of $B$, the flux is proportional to $[B]$.

This is a direct consequence of the rate relationship, as a higher rate leads to a shorter time to achieve the effect.\n$$t \\propto \\frac{1}{f_{\\text{unionized}}}$$\nThis implies that the product $t \\cdot f_{\\text{unionized}}$ is a constant. Therefore, we can write:\n$$t_{7.4} \\cdot f_{7.4} = t_{7.6} \\cdot f_{7.6}$$\nwhere $t_{7.4}$ and $t_{7.6}$ are the onset times at $pH=7.4$ and $pH=7.6$, respectively.\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio $t_{7.4} / t_{7.6}$.\n$$\\frac{t_{7.4}}{t_{7.6}} = \\frac{f_{7.6}}{f_{7.4}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $f_{7.4}$ and $f_{7.6}$:\n$$\\frac{t_{7.4}}{t_{7.6}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{0.5}}}{\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{0.7}}} = \\frac{1 + 10^{0.7}}{1 + 10^{0.5}}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value of this ratio.\n$10^{0.7} \\approx 5.011872336$\n$10^{0.5} = \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.162277660$\n$$\\frac{t_{7.4}}{t_{7.6}} = \\frac{1 + 5.011872336}{1 + 3.162277660} = \\frac{6.011872336}{4.162277660} \\approx 1.4443606$$\nRounding the final ratio to four significant figures gives $1.444$.\nThis result indicates that the onset time at the physiological $pH$ of $7.4$ is predicted to be approximately $1.444$ times longer than the onset time after alkalinization to a $pH$ of $7.6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.444}$$", "id": "5175754"}]}
