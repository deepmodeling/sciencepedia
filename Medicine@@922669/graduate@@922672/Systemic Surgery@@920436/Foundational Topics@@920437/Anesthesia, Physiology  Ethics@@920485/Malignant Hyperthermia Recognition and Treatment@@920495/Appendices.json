No rounding is required beyond the exact arithmetic implied by the provided values.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and based on established principles of physiology and biochemistry. It presents a realistic clinical scenario and provides all necessary data for the required derivation and calculation.\n\nThe solution begins with the fundamental principle of plasma electroneutrality. This principle mandates that the total concentration of positive charges (cations) must be equal to the total concentration of negative charges (anions) in any given volume of plasma to maintain a net charge of zero. This can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\sum [\\text{Cations}] = \\sum [\\text{Anions}]\n$$\nIn plasma, these ions can be categorized into those that are routinely measured in a basic metabolic panel and those that are not (unmeasured). Expanding the equation with the major ionic species:\n$$([\\text{Na}^+] + [\\text{K}^+] + [\\text{Ca}^{2+}] + [\\text{Mg}^{2+}] + \\dots) = ([\\text{Cl}^-] + [\\text{HCO}_3^-] + [\\text{Proteins}^-] + [\\text{Organic acids}^-] + [\\text{PO}_4^{3-}] + [\\text{SO}_4^{2-}] + \\dots)$$\nThis can be simplified by grouping ions into measured and unmeasured categories. Let $UC$ be the sum of a ll unmeasured cations and $UA$ be the sum of all unmeasured anions. The conventionally measured ions are $[\\text{Na}^+]$, $[\\text{K}^+]$, $[\\text{Cl}^-]$, and $[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$. The electroneutrality equation is:\n$$\n[\\text{Measured Cations}] + [UC] = [\\text{Measured Anions}] + [UA]\n$$\nThe Anion Gap ($AG$) is defined as the difference between the unmeasured anions and unmeasured cations. Rearranging the above equation to solve for this difference:\n$$\n[UA] - [UC] = [\\text{Measured Cations}] - [\\text{Measured Anions}]\n$$\nThus, the anion gap is computationally the difference between the commonly measured cations and anions.\n$$\nAG = ([\\text{Na}^+] + [\\text{K}^+]) - ([\\text{Cl}^-] + [\\text{HCO}_3^-])\n$$\nThe problem asks to justify the standard modeling choice of treating $[\\text{Na}^+]$ as the dominant, and often sole, measured cation for this calculation. This simplification is justified by the relative physiological concentrations of the plasma cations. The typical plasma concentration of sodium, $[\\text{Na}^+]$, is approximately $135-145 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/L}$. The concentration of potassium, $[\\text{K}^+]$, is much lower, typically $3.5-5.0 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/L}$. The contribution of $[\\text{K}^+]$ is small and its concentration can fluctuate. Omitting it from the calculation simplifies the formula and has a minor impact on the result, which is well within the noise of the measurement and biological variability. Therefore, the clinically standard and simplified expression for the anion gap is derived by considering only $[\\text{Na}^+]$ as the measured cation:\n$$\nAG = [\\text{Na}^+] - ([\\text{Cl}^-] + [\\text{HCO}_3^-])\n$$\nThis expression represents the pool of unmeasured anions (such as albumin, phosphate, and sulfate) minus the pool of unmeasured cations (such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium), which normally results in a small positive value.\n\nUsing the data provided in the problem statement:\n-   $[\\text{Na}^+] = 140\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}$\n-   $[\\text{Cl}^-] = 103\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}$\n-   $[\\text{HCO}_3^-] = 20\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}$\n\nWe can now compute the value of the anion gap:\n$$\nAG = 140 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/L} - (103 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/L} + 20 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/L})\n$$\n$$\nAG = 140 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/L} - 123 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/L}\n$$\n$$\nAG = 17 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/L}\n$$\nA normal anion gap is typically in the range of $8-12 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/L}$. The calculated value of $17 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/L}$ is elevated, indicating an excess of unmeasured anions.\n\nThe final part of the problem is to explain, from first principles, why a hypermetabolic state such as malignant hyperthermia (MH) leads to an elevation of the anion gap.\n1.  **Pathophysiology of MH:** MH is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle. In susceptible individuals, triggering agents (such as volatile halogenated anesthetics and succinylcholine) cause a defect in the ryanodine receptor ($RYR1$), leading to a massive and sustained release of calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the muscle cell cytoplasm.\n2.  **Hypermetabolism:** This uncontrolled elevation in myoplasmic $[Ca^{2+}]$ drives sustained muscle contraction (rigidity) and forces sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum $Ca^{2+}$-ATPase ($SERCA$) pumps to work excessively to re-sequester the $Ca^{2+}$, a process that consumes large amounts of ATP. This creates an extreme hypermetabolic state, where the oxygen demand of the muscle tissue massively outstrips the body's capacity for oxygen delivery.\n3.  **Shift to Anaerobic Glycolysis:** Due to the relative oxygen deficit, the muscle cells switch from aerobic respiration to anaerobic glycolysis as the primary means of generating ATP.\n4.  **Lactic Acid Production:** The metabolic endpoint of anaerobic glycolysis is the conversion of pyruvate to lactic acid ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH(OH)COOH}$).\n5.  **Dissociation and Acidosis:** In the physiological pH of blood, lactic acid rapidly dissociates into a lactate anion ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{CH(OH)COO}^-$) and a proton ($\\text{H}^+$).\n    $$ \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH(OH)COOH} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{CH}_3\\text{CH(OH)COO}^- + \\text{H}^+ $$\n6.  **Impact on Measured Values:** The released protons ($\\text{H}^+$) are buffered by the bicarbonate system ($\\text{H}^+ + \\text{HCO}_3^- \\rightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3 \\rightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + \\text{CO}_2$), which consumes bicarbonate and lowers the measured plasma $[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$. The increased $\\text{CO}_2$ production is exhaled, causing the observed rise in end-tidal $\\text{CO}_2$. The lactate anion, however, is not one of the ions measured in the standard anion gap calculation. It therefore accumulates in the pool of \"unmeasured anions\" ($UA$).\n7.  **Elevated Anion Gap:** As derived previously, the anion gap is $AG \\approx [UA] - [UC]$. The massive production of lactate causes a significant increase in $[UA]$. This increase in unmeasured anions, coupled with the decrease in measured anions ($[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$), results in a high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis, which is a key diagnostic feature of malignant hyperthermia. The calculated value of $17 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/L}$ is consistent with this pathophysiology.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{17}\n$$", "id": "5145872"}, {"introduction": "The definitive treatment for MH is the prompt administration of dantrolene sodium, but preparing the correct dose under pressure presents a significant logistical challenge.

Let $N$ be the number of vials used, and $m_{vial}$ be the mass of dantrolene per vial. Since vials cannot be partially used in this context (one must open a whole vial), $N$ must be a positive integer, $N \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. The total mass available is $N \\times m_{vial}$.\n\nThe integer constraint is thus explicitly formulated as:\n$$N \\times m_{vial} \\ge M_{target}$$\nTo find the minimal integer number of vials, $N_{min}$, we must find the smallest integer $N$ that satisfies this inequality.

The provided reconstitution volumes ($60\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ for Dantrium/Revonto and $5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ for Ryanodex) are relevant for drug administration but not for calculating the mass and number of vials required, so they are not used in this part of the calculation.\n\nFor the Dantrium/Revonto formulation:\n$m_{vial} = m_{D_v} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\nLet $N_D$ be the minimal number of Dantrium/Revonto vials.\n$$N_D = \\left\\lceil \\frac{M_{target}}{m_{D_v}} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{225\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{20\\,\\mathrm{mg/vial}} \\right\\rceil$$\n$$N_D = \\lceil 11.25 \\rceil = 12$$\nThus, $12$ vials of Dantrium/Revonto are required.\n\nFor the Ryanodex formulation:\n$m_{vial} = m_{R_v} = 250\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\nLet $N_R$ be the minimal number of Ryanodex vials.\n$$N_R = \\left\\lceil \\frac{M_{target}}{m_{R_v}} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{225\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{250\\,\\mathrm{mg/vial}} \\right\\rceil$$\n$$N_R = \\lceil 0.9 \\rceil = 1$$\nThus, $1$ vial of Ryanodex is required.\n\nThe problem asks for the difference in vial counts required between Dantrium/Revonto and Ryanodex.
