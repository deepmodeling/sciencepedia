Provide your final numeric outputs only.", "solution": "### Explanation of Lung-Protective Ventilation\n\nThe principle that low tidal volume is lung-protective is derived from the mechanical properties of lung tissue, conceptualized through a stress-strain relationship.\n\n$1$. **Stress and Strain in the Lung**: In mechanics, stress is the force applied per unit area, and strain is the resulting fractional deformation. For the lung, stress is analogous to the transpulmonary pressure ($P_L$), which is the pressure difference between the airway opening and the pleural space. This pressure is what distends the lung parenchyma. Strain ($\\epsilon$) is the change in lung volume ($\\Delta V$) relative to the lung's resting volume at end-expiration, known as the Functional Residual Capacity ($FRC$).\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{\\Delta V}{FRC}\n$$\nIn mechanical ventilation, the change in volume $\\Delta V$ is the tidal volume ($V_T$). Therefore, the global lung strain is proportional to the ratio of the tidal volume to the functional lung volume at the start of the breath.\n$$\n\\epsilon \\propto \\frac{V_T}{FRC}\n$$\n$2$. **Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI)**: Lung tissue, like any biological material, has a finite tolerance for stress and strain. If the strain exceeds a certain threshold, the tissue is injured. This can manifest as disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier, inflammatory mediator release, and propagation of injury. This iatrogenic damage is termed Ventilator-Induced Lung Injury (VILI). The specific injury from excessive volume and strain is called volutrauma.\n\n$3$. **The \"Baby Lung\" Concept**: In conditions such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which is common in critically ill surgical patients, the lung is not homogeneously injured. A significant portion of the lung may be collapsed or filled with fluid, rendering it non-aerated and non-functional. The remaining aerated and compliant portion of the lung, which must accommodate the entire tidal volume, is thus much smaller than the total lung size. This concept is often called the \"baby lung.\" The effective $FRC$ is markedly reduced.\n\n$4$. **Mechanism of Protection**: If a tidal volume is chosen based on the patient's actual overall size (e.g., using actual body weight) and applied to this small \"baby lung,\" the denominator ($FRC$) in the strain equation is small. This results in a very high strain ($\\epsilon$), leading to volutrauma. The core principle of lung-protective ventilation is to limit this strain. By selecting a low tidal volume, specifically one scaled to a predicted, healthy lung size (for which Predicted Body Weight, $PBW$, is a practical surrogate), the numerator ($V_T$) is kept small. This small $V_T$ delivered to the reduced $FRC$ helps to keep the strain below the injurious threshold, thus protecting the lung from further damage. This is the rationale for the widely adopted strategy of using low tidal volumes, such as $6\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$ of $PBW$.\n\n### Calculation of Ventilator Settings\n\nThe calculations proceed in two parts as requested.\n\n**1. Initial Tidal Volume ($V_T$)**\n\nThe tidal volume is set at $6\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$ based on the patient's Predicted Body Weight ($PBW$). For a male patient, the standard formula for $PBW$ is:\n$$\nPBW\\,(\\text{kg}) = 50 + 0.91 \\times (\\text{Height in cm} - 152.4)\n$$\nThe patient's height is given as $H = 175\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. We first calculate the $PBW$.\n$$\nPBW = 50 + 0.91 \\times (175 - 152.4) = 50 + 0.91 \\times 22.6 = 50 + 20.566 = 70.566\\,\\mathrm{kg}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the Tidal Volume ($V_T$) using the target of $6\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$.\n$$\nV_T = 6\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg} \\times PBW = 6 \\times 70.566\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 423.396\\,\\mathrm{mL}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the initial Tidal Volume is $V_T = 423\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\n**2. Initial Respiratory Rate ($f$)**\n\nThe respiratory rate ($f$) must be set to ensure adequate elimination of metabolically produced carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$) to meet the target arterial $\\text{CO}_2$ tension ($\\mathrm{PaCO_2}$). In a steady state, the rate of $\\text{CO}_2$ elimination by the lungs must equal the rate of $\\text{CO}_2$ production by the body ($\\dot{V}_{CO_2}$).\n\nThe rate of $\\text{CO}_2$ elimination is determined by the alveolar ventilation ($\\dot{V}_A$) and the arterial $\\text{CO}_2$ partial pressure. The governing relationship is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PaCO_2} = k \\frac{\\dot{V}_{CO_2}}{\\dot{V}_A}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant approximately equal to $863\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ when $\\dot{V}_{CO_2}$ is in $\\mathrm{mL/min}$ (STPD) and $\\dot{V}_A$ is in $\\mathrm{L/min}$ (BTPS), or using consistent volume units in $\\mathrm{mL/min}$ for both. Alveolar ventilation is the volume of fresh gas reaching the alveoli per minute. It is the total minute ventilation ($\\dot{V}_E$) minus the dead space ventilation ($\\dot{V}_D$).\n$$\n\\dot{V}_A = \\dot{V}_E - \\dot{V}_D = (V_T \\times f) - (V_D \\times f) = (V_T - V_D) \\times f\n$$\nThe problem provides the dead space as a fraction of the tidal volume, $\\phi = \\frac{V_D}{V_T} = 0.30$.
