The concept of deposition velocity ($v_d$) is a standard and physically meaningful parameterization used to model particle deposition from a fluid onto a surface, effectively lumping together complex transport mechanisms like gravitational settling and turbulent diffusion. The values for concentration and deposition velocity are realistic for a controlled environment like an operating room.

It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, or ill-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived and computed.\n\n### Derivation of the Governing Equation\nLet $N_s(t)$ be the surface number density of microorganisms (in CFU per unit area) on the drape at time $t$. The rate of change of this surface density, $\\frac{dN_s}{dt}$, is equal to the net flux of microorganisms to the surface.\n\nThe flux, $J$, is defined as the rate of deposition per unit area. According to the problem statement, this flux is described by the product of the airborne concentration, $C$, and the deposition velocity, $v_d$.\n$$J = C \\cdot v_d$$\nThe units of this expression are $(\\text{CFU} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3}) \\cdot (\\text{m} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}) = \\text{CFU} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$, which correctly represents a flux of particles to a surface.\n\nSince the problem states there is no removal mechanism, the rate of accumulation on the surface is equal to the deposition flux. This gives the following first-order ordinary differential equation for the surface number density:\n$$\\frac{dN_s}{dt} = J = C \\cdot v_d$$\nThe problem specifies that both $C$ and $v_d$ are constant over time. To find the surface density $N_s$ after a total exposure time $t$, we integrate this equation with respect to time from $t'=0$ to $t'=t$.\n$$\\int_{N_s(0)}^{N_s(t)} dN_s' = \\int_{0}^{t} (C \\cdot v_d) dt'$$\nWe assume the drape is sterile at the beginning of the exposure, so the initial surface density is $N_s(0) = 0$. Since $C$ and $v_d$ are constants, they can be moved outside the integral.\n$$N_s(t) - N_s(0) = C \\cdot v_d \\int_{0}^{t} dt'$$\n$$N_s(t) - 0 = C \\cdot v_d \\cdot [t']_{0}^{t}$$\nThis yields the expression for the time-evolution of the surface number density:\n$$N_s(t) = C \\cdot v_d \\cdot t$$\n\n### Calculation of Final Surface Bioburden\nNow, we use the derived expression to compute the numerical value of the bioburden after the specified exposure time.\n\nThe given values are:\n-   $C = 6.5 \\text{ CFU} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3}$\n-   $v_{d} = 1.1 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$\n-   $t = 1.75 \\text{ h}$\n\nFirst, all units must be made consistent.

The procedure continues for a remaining duration of $T=2$ hours. Two possible moisture states of the contaminated drape area are considered: wet (from irrigation run-off) versus dry (after immediate blotting and air exposure). Under each moisture state, the team anticipates occasional inadvertent glove contacts with the contaminated zone at a mean rate of $\\lambda=6$ contacts per hour, and assumes that the expected fraction of viable organisms transferred to the glove per contact is $\\beta_{W}=0.10$ when wet and $\\beta_{D}=0.01$ when dry, reflecting capillary wicking and film-mediated transfer in the wet state versus reduced pick-up when dry.
