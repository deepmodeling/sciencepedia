Before the checklist, the observed wrong-site surgery risk per procedure was $1/10{,}000$. After implementation, the observed wrong-site surgery risk per procedure is $0.2/10{,}000$. Treat each procedure as an independent Bernoulli trial with a constant per-procedure probability of a wrong-site event over the evaluation period.

The baseline risk, which is the probability of a wrong-site surgery per procedure before the intervention, is denoted as $p_0$.\n$$p_0 = \\frac{1}{10,000} = 0.0001$$\nThe risk after the implementation of the checklist, denoted as $p_1$, is the probability of the same event in the intervention group.\n$$p_1 = \\frac{0.2}{10,000} = 0.00002$$\n\nWith these probabilities defined, we can derive the required quantities based on their standard definitions.\n\n1.  **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)**\n    The absolute risk reduction is the arithmetic difference between the event rate in the control group ($p_0$) and the event rate in the treatment group ($p_1$). It measures the absolute effect of the intervention.\n    $$ARR = p_0 - p_1$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$ARR = 0.0001 - 0.00002 = 0.00008$$\n    The problem requires rounding to $4$ significant figures. To express $0.00008$ with $4$ significant figures, we write it as $0.00008000$.\n\n2.  **Relative Risk Reduction (RRR)**\n    The relative risk reduction measures the proportional reduction in risk attributable to the intervention. It is calculated by dividing the absolute risk reduction by the baseline risk. It can be expressed as:\n    $$RRR = \\frac{ARR}{p_0} = \\frac{p_0 - p_1}{p_0} = 1 - \\frac{p_1}{p_0}$$\n    Using the calculated $ARR$ and the given $p_0$:\n    $$RRR = \\frac{0.00008}{0.0001} = 0.8$$\n    Alternatively, using the other form of the equation:\n    $$RRR = 1 - \\frac{0.00002}{0.0001} = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$$\n    Rounding this result to $4$ significant figures gives $0.8000$.\n\n3.  **Number Needed to Treat (NNT)**\n    The number needed to treat is an estimate of the average number of patients who need to receive the intervention (in this case, procedures performed with the checklist) for one additional adverse outcome to be prevented. Per the problem statement, it is calculated as the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction, treated as a real-valued quantity.\n    $$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\n    Substituting the value of $ARR$:\n    $$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.00008} = \\frac{1}{8 \\times 10^{-5}} = \\frac{10^5}{8} = 12,500$$\n    The problem requires this value to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The number $12,500$ can be written in scientific notation as $1.250 \\times 10^4$. This representation shows that the number already has exactly $4$ significant figures. Thus, the value is $12500$.\n\nThe three derived quantities, rounded to $4$ significant figures as required, are:\n-   Absolute Risk Reduction: $0.00008000$\n-   Relative Risk Reduction: $0.8000$\n-   Number Needed to Treat: $12500$\nThese values will be presented in the specified order within the final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.00008000 & 0.8000 & 12500\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5159916"}, {"introduction": "Effective use of the checklist goes beyond simple verification; it requires active clinical reasoning. This practice focuses on a critical checklist item—ensuring adequate antimicrobial prophylaxis—and challenges you to apply pharmacokinetic principles to a dynamic surgical environment. You will determine the appropriate redosing schedule for an antibiotic based on its half-life, $t_{1/2}$, ensuring the patient's plasma concentration remains above the minimum inhibitory concentration ($MIC$) throughout the entire procedure and transforming a static checklist item into a time-dependent clinical decision. [@problem_id:5159931]", "problem": "A core element of operating room safety protocols, as formalized in the World Health Organization Surgical Safety Checklist, is verification that perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis will maintain free-drug plasma concentration above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the entire incision-to-closure interval. Consider a patient receiving cefazolin as intravenous bolus at induction. Assume a one-compartment model with first-order elimination, rapid distribution to a steady initial free plasma concentration, and constant volume of distribution throughout the case. The half-life is $t_{1/2} = 1.8$ hours. Immediately after the initial dose, the free plasma concentration equals $C_0 = 4 \\times \\text{MIC}$.

To drop to a quarter of the initial value, it takes two half-lives.\n\nWith $t_{1/2} = 1.8$ hours, the maximum efficacy interval for a single dose is:\n$$ \\tau = 2 \\times 1.8 \\text{ hours} = 3.6 \\text{ hours} $$\nThe total procedure duration is 5 hours. Since the initial dose covers only the first 3.6 hours, at least one redose is needed. To minimize the number of doses, the first redose should be administered at the latest possible time, $t_1 = 3.6$ hours.\n\nThis redose, given at 3.6 hours, resets the concentration to $4 \\times \\text{MIC}$ and provides coverage for another interval of $\\tau = 3.6$ hours, extending up to $3.6 + 3.6 = 7.2$ hours. Since the procedure ends at 5 hours, which is before 7.2 hours, this single redose is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of redoses is 1, administered at 3.6 hours.
