The answer is unitless.", "solution": "The problem asks for the post-test probability of a patient having a deep incisional surgical site infection given a positive culture result. We must derive this from the fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and conditional probability.\n\nFirst, let us define the relevant events:\n- $I$: The event that the patient truly has a deep incisional surgical site infection.\n- $I^c$: The complementary event that the patient does not have a deep incisional surgical site infection.\n- $T^+$: The event that the deep tissue culture result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the deep tissue culture result is negative.\n\nNext, we formalize the information provided in the problem statement:\n1.  The pre-test (prior) probability of infection is $P(I) = 0.3$.\n    The prior probability of no infection is therefore $P(I^c) = 1 - P(I) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$.\n\n2.  The sensitivity of the assay is the probability of a positive test given the presence of the infection. This is a conditional probability:\n    $P(T^+ | I) = 0.85$.\n\n3.  The specificity of the assay is the probability of a negative test given the absence of the infection:\n    $P(T^- | I^c) = 0.90$.\n\nFrom the specificity, we can deduce the probability of a positive test in a patient without the infection (the false positive rate). Since a test result can only be positive or negative, the probabilities must sum to $1$:\n$P(T^+ | I^c) + P(T^- | I^c) = 1$.\nTherefore, $P(T^+ | I^c) = 1 - P(T^- | I^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\nOur objective is to compute the post-test probability of infection given the positive culture result, which is the conditional probability $P(I | T^+)$.\n\nAccording to the definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$ P(I | T^+) = \\frac{P(I \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)} $$\nwhere $P(I \\cap T^+)$ is the joint probability of having the infection and a positive test, and $P(T^+)$ is the total probability of a positive test.\n\nLet us evaluate the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\nThe numerator, $P(I \\cap T^+)$, can be determined by rearranging the definition of the conditional probability $P(T^+ | I)$:\n$P(T^+ | I) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\cap I)}{P(I)}$.\nSince $P(T^+ \\cap I) = P(I \\cap T^+)$, we can write:\n$$ P(I \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | I) \\times P(I) $$\nThis quantity represents the probability of a true positive outcome.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: either the patient has the infection and tests positive ($I \\cap T^+$), or the patient does not have the infection and tests positive ($I^c \\cap T^+$). Using the law of total probability, we can express $P(T^+)$ as the sum of the probabilities of these two disjoint events:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(I \\cap T^+) + P(I^c \\cap T^+) $$\nWe have already found an expression for the first term. The second term, $P(I^c \\cap T^+)$, can be found similarly using the conditional probability $P(T^+ | I^c)$:\n$$ P(I^c \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | I^c) \\times P(I^c) $$\nThis quantity represents the probability of a false positive outcome.\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the formula for $P(T^+)$, we get:\n$$ P(T^+) = (P(T^+ | I) \\times P(I)) + (P(T^+ | I^c) \\times P(I^c)) $$\n\nNow, we can assemble the final expression for our desired probability, $P(I | T^+)$, by substituting the derived expressions for the numerator and denominator:\n$$ P(I | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | I) \\times P(I)}{(P(T^+ | I) \\times P(I)) + (P(T^+ | I^c) \\times P(I^c))} $$\n\nTo compute the final numerical answer as an exact fraction, we convert the given decimal probabilities to fractions:\n- $P(I) = 0.3 = \\frac{3}{10}$\n- $P(I^c) = 0.7 = \\frac{7}{10}$\n- $P(T^+ | I) = 0.85 = \\frac{85}{100} = \\frac{17}{20}$\n- $P(T^+ | I^c) = 0.10 = \\frac{1}{10}$\n\nNow, we calculate the components:\nThe probability of a true positive is:\n$$ P(I \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | I) \\times P(I) = \\frac{17}{20} \\times \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{51}{200} $$\nThe probability of a false positive is:\n$$ P(I^c \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | I^c) \\times P(I^c) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{7}{100} = \\frac{14}{200} $$\nThe total probability of a positive test is the sum of these two probabilities:\n$$ P(T^+) = \\frac{51}{200} + \\frac{14}{200} = \\frac{65}{200} $$\nFinally, the post-test probability of infection is the ratio of the true positive probability to the total probability of a positive test:\n$$ P(I | T^+) = \\frac{P(I \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{51/200}{65/200} = \\frac{51}{65} $$\nThe fraction $\\frac{51}{65}$ is in its simplest form, as the prime factorization of the numerator is $51 = 3 \\times 17$ and the prime factorization of the denominator is $65 = 5 \\times 13$.

This corresponds to a relative risk reduction of $1 - 0.5455 = 0.4545$, or $45.45\\%$. This indicates a substantial protective effect of the chlorhexidine–alcohol preparation relative to the control.\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) of $0.02500$ indicates that for every $100$ patients treated with chlorhexidine–alcohol instead of povidone–iodine–alcohol, $2.5$ SSIs are prevented. This provides a direct, absolute measure of the intervention's impact, which is often more useful for public health and clinical resourcing decisions than the relative measure.\nThe Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) of $40$ means that, on average, surgeons must use chlorhexidine–alcohol antisepsis on $40$ patients to prevent one additional SSI that would have occurred if povidone–iodine–alcohol had been used instead.
