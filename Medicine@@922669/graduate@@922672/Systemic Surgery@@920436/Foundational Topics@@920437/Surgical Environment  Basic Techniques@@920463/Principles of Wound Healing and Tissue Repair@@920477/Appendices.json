We begin by formulating the governing differential equation based on the principle of mass conservation. In one spatial dimension, $x$, the local change in concentration, $c(x,t)$, over time, $t$, is determined by the divergence of the diffusive flux, $J$, and the rate of reaction, $R$.\n\nThe conservation law is written as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} + R\n$$\n\nAccording to Fick’s first law of diffusion, the flux $J$ is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient:\n$$\nJ = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nThe reaction is a first-order degradation, meaning the rate of PDGF removal is directly proportional to its concentration. This is expressed as:\n$$\nR = -kc\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the first-order degradation rate constant.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $J$ and $R$ into the conservation equation yields the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right) - kc\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} - kc\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state concentration profile. In steady state, the concentration at any point in space does not change with time, which means $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$. The partial differential equation thus simplifies to an ordinary differential equation (ODE), as concentration now depends only on the spatial variable $x$:\n$$\n0 = D \\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - kc\n$$\n\nThis can be rearranged into a standard form for a second-order linear homogeneous ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} = \\frac{k}{D} c\n$$\n\nThe problem states that in the source-free region ($x0$), the solution has the form $c(x) \\propto \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$. We can write this as $c(x) = C_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, where $C_0$ is the concentration at $x=0$. To find the relationship between $\\lambda$, $D$, and $k$, we substitute this proposed solution into the ODE.\n\nFirst, we find the first and second derivatives of $c(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dx} = C_0 \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) = -\\frac{C_0}{\\lambda} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2c}{dx^2} = -\\frac{C_0}{\\lambda} \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\frac{C_0}{\\lambda^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow, substitute the second derivative and the function $c(x)$ back into the steady-state ODE, $D \\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} = kc$:\n$$\nD \\left( \\frac{C_0}{\\lambda^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) \\right) = k \\left( C_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) \\right)\n$$\n\nFor a non-trivial solution, $C_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$ is non-zero, so we can divide both sides by this term:\n$$\nD \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} = k\n$$\n\nSolving for the characteristic length scale $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 = \\frac{D}{k}\n$$\nSince $\\lambda$ represents a physical distance, it must be positive. Therefore, we take the positive square root:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the characteristic signaling length scale.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\lambda$ numerically using the given values: $D = 100\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ and $k = 0.01\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{100\\,\\mu\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{0.01\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{100}{0.01}}\\,\\mu\\text{m} = \\sqrt{10000}\\,\\mu\\text{m}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = 100\\,\\mu\\text{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact value is $100$. To express this unambiguously to three significant figures, it is written in scientific notation as $1.00 \\times 10^2 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nFinally, we interpret the biological meaning of $\\lambda$. The value $\\lambda = 100\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ represents the characteristic distance over which the PDGF signal is effective. Specifically, it is the distance from the source at which the steady-state PDGF concentration drops to $1/e$ (approximately $37\\%$) of its initial value. This length scale defines the spatial extent of the signaling gradient.\n\nTo understand its significance, we compare this length to the size of a typical cell that responds to PDGF, such as a fibroblast or an endothelial cell. These cells have diameters on the order of $10\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ to $20\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. Therefore, the signaling length scale of $\\lambda = 100\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ spans a distance of approximately $5$ to $10$ cell diameters.\n\nThis has a critical biological implication for wound healing. It means that PDGF released from the wound clot does not merely act on the cells immediately adjacent to it. Instead, it establishes a chemical gradient that extends over a multicellular domain. This gradient serves two purposes:\n1.  **Recruitment**: It ensures that a sufficiently large population of cells in the surrounding tissue is exposed to a super-threshold concentration of PDGF, stimulating them to proliferate and migrate towards the wound to begin tissue repair.\n2.  **Directionality**: The gradient itself can provide directional cues (chemotaxis) for cell migration, guiding cells precisely to the site of injury.\n\nThe characteristic length $\\lambda=\\sqrt{D/k}$ encapsulates the fundamental trade-off between signal propagation (diffusion, $D$) and signal clearance (degradation, $k$). This balance is crucial for creating a signal that is widespread enough to orchestrate a collective cellular response but localized enough to confine the healing process to the immediate vicinity of the wound, preventing an excessive or inappropriate tissue reaction.

The guiding principle is that wound healing proceeds when the local oxygen supply, measured by the transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure ($p$), meets or exceeds a physiological threshold ($p_{\\text{thr}}$).\n\nFirst, we must formalize the concept of the margin of adequacy. Let this margin be denoted by the scalar quantity $M$. The problem states that healing is adequate when the oxygen supply *meets or exceeds* the requirement. A natural and direct way to quantify the \"margin\" of this adequacy is to compute the difference between the available oxygen partial pressure ($p$) and the required threshold pressure ($p_{\\text{thr}}$). This definition provides a measure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and indicates not just whether the condition is met, but by how much it is exceeded or by how much it falls short.\nTherefore, we define the margin of adequacy, $M$, as:\n$$M = p - p_{\\text{thr}}$$\nA positive value of $M$ indicates a surplus of oxygen relative to the healing threshold, suggesting conditions are favorable for healing. A negative value indicates an oxygen deficit, suggesting conditions are unfavorable. A value of $M=0$ indicates that the oxygen supply is exactly at the minimum required level.\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\nThe baseline (pre-intervention) transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure is $p_0 = 20$ mmHg.\nThe clinical threshold for adequate healing is $p_{\\text{thr}} = 30$ mmHg.\nThe expected increase in TcPO2 following revascularization is $\\Delta p = 15$ mmHg.\n\nWe are asked to compute the margin of adequacy for two states: the baseline state and the post-intervention state.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the margin for the baseline state, which we will denote as $M_{\\text{baseline}}$.

Using our derived formula for the margin:\n$$M_{\\text{baseline}} = p_0 - p_{\\text{thr}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$M_{\\text{baseline}} = 20 \\text{ mmHg} - 30 \\text{ mmHg} = -10 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nThis negative margin indicates that at baseline, the local tissue oxygenation is insufficient for wound healing, with a deficit of $10$ mmHg relative to the required threshold.\n\nNext, we evaluate the post-intervention state. The revascularization procedure is expected to increase the local TcPO2 by $\\Delta p$.
