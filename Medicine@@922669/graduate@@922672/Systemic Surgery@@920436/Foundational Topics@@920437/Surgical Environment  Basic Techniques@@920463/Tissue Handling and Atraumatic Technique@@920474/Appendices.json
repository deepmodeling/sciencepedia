Physiologic conduction fails for strains exceeding $0.08$. This means that for $\\varepsilon  0.08$, the nerve ceases to function correctly.\n2.  Structural damage is observed for strains exceeding $0.15$. This means that for $\\varepsilon  0.15$, the nerve tissue is physically damaged.\n\n\"Safe\" retraction is explicitly defined as a maneuver that maintains physiologic conduction. This definition directs us to use the first threshold. To maintain physiologic conduction, the strain $\\varepsilon$ must not exceed the failure threshold.

We consider an infinitesimal segment of the suture in contact with the underlying part, subtending an angle $d\\phi$. Let $T(\\phi)$ be the tension in the suture at an angle $\\phi$.\n\nA free-body diagram of this infinitesimal segment reveals four forces:\n1. The tension $T$ at one end.\n2. The tension $T+dT$ at the other end, where $dT$ is the infinitesimal change in tension over the segment.\n3. The infinitesimal normal force $dN$ exerted by the underlying suture, directed towards the center of curvature.\n4. The infinitesimal friction force $dF_f$ opposing the direction of higher tension, acting tangentially. Under quasi-static conditions at the point of impending slippage, this force is given by the law of Coulomb friction: $dF_f = \\mu \\, dN$, where $\\mu$ is the coefficient of static friction.\n\nWe establish a local coordinate system with axes tangential and normal to the suture segment.
