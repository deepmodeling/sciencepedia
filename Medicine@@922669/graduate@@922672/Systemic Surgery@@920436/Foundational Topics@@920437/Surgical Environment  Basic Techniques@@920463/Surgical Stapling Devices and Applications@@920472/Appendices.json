The selection is to be based on minimizing the expected misformation loss for a tissue transection. The tissue thickness, $T$, is a random variable following a normal distribution, $T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^{2})$, with a mean of $\\mu = 1.7 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and a standard deviation of $\\sigma = 0.3 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$. The misformation loss function is given as the absolute difference between the tissue thickness and the closed staple height, $L(T, h) = |T - h|$. Our objective is to minimize the expected loss, $E(h) = \\mathbb{E}[|T - h|]$.\n\nFirst, we will derive the general condition that characterizes the optimal closed height $h^{\\star}$ which minimizes $E(h)$. Let $f(t)$ and $F(t)$ be the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variable $T$, respectively. The expected loss can be expressed as an integral:\n$$E(h) = \\mathbb{E}[|T - h|] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |t - h| f(t) \\, dt$$\n\nTo eliminate the absolute value function, we split the integral at the point $t=h$:\n$$E(h) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{h} (h - t) f(t) \\, dt + \\int_{h}^{\\infty} (t - h) f(t) \\, dt$$\n\nTo find the value of $h$ that minimizes $E(h)$, we differentiate $E(h)$ with respect to $h$ and set the derivative to zero. We apply the Leibniz integral rule for differentiation under the integral sign. For the first term, we have:\n$$\\frac{d}{dh} \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{h} (h - t) f(t) \\, dt \\right) = \\frac{d}{dh} \\left( h \\int_{-\\infty}^{h} f(t) \\, dt - \\int_{-\\infty}^{h} t f(t) \\, dt \\right)$$\n$$= \\left( 1 \\cdot \\int_{-\\infty}^{h} f(t) \\, dt + h \\cdot f(h) \\right) - \\left( h \\cdot f(h) \\right) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{h} f(t) \\, dt = F(h)$$\n\nFor the second term, we have:\n$$\\frac{d}{dh} \\left( \\int_{h}^{\\infty} (t - h) f(t) \\, dt \\right) = \\frac{d}{dh} \\left( \\int_{h}^{\\infty} t f(t) \\, dt - h \\int_{h}^{\\infty} f(t) \\, dt \\right)$$\n$$= \\left( -h \\cdot f(h) \\right) - \\left( 1 \\cdot \\int_{h}^{\\infty} f(t) \\, dt + h \\cdot (-f(h)) \\right) = -\\int_{h}^{\\infty} f(t) \\, dt$$\nSince $\\int_{h}^{\\infty} f(t) \\, dt = 1 - F(h)$, this derivative becomes $-(1 - F(h))$.\n\nCombining the derivatives of both terms, we obtain the derivative of the expected loss function:\n$$\\frac{dE}{dh} = F(h) - (1 - F(h)) = 2F(h) - 1$$\n\nTo find the optimal height $h^{\\star}$, we set this derivative to zero:\n$$2F(h^{\\star}) - 1 = 0 \\implies F(h^{\\star}) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis condition, $F(h^{\\star}) = 0.5$, is the definition of the median of the probability distribution of $T$. Therefore, the expected absolute error is minimized when $h$ is chosen to be the median of the distribution.\n\nTo verify that this is a minimum, we inspect the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{d^2E}{dh^2} = \\frac{d}{dh} (2F(h) - 1) = 2 \\frac{dF(h)}{dh} = 2f(h)$$\nSince $f(h)$, the PDF, is non-negative for all values of $h$ (and strictly positive for a normal distribution), the second derivative is positive. This confirms that $h^{\\star}$ corresponds to a minimum, and the expected loss function $E(h)$ is convex.\n\nNext, we apply this finding to the specific problem. The tissue thickness $T$ is given to follow a normal distribution, $T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu=1.7, \\sigma^2=0.3^2)$. A fundamental property of the normal distribution is its symmetry about the mean. This symmetry ensures that the mean, median, and mode of the distribution are all equal.\nConsequently, the median of the distribution of $T$ is equal to its mean:\n$$\\text{median}(T) = \\mu = 1.7 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe theoretically optimal closed staple height that minimizes the expected misformation is $h^{\\star} = 1.7 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nThe problem requires a choice between two discrete options: $h_1 = 1.5 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and $h_2 = 1.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$. As established, the expected loss function $E(h)$ is convex with its minimum at $h^{\\star} = 1.7 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$. For a convex function, the value of the function increases as the input moves away from the minimum. Therefore, to minimize $E(h)$, we must choose the candidate height that is closer to the optimal value $h^{\\star}$.\n\nWe calculate the absolute distance of each candidate height from the optimal height:\nDistance for $h_1$: $|h_1 - h^{\\star}| = |1.5 - 1.7| = |-0.2| = 0.2 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\nDistance for $h_2$: $|h_2 - h^{\\star}| = |1.8 - 1.7| = |0.1| = 0.1 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nComparing the two distances, we find that $|h_2 - h^{\\star}|  |h_1 - h^{\\star}|$. This indicates that the cartridge with closed staple height $h_2$ incurs a lower expected misformation loss than the cartridge with height $h_1$. Thus, the rational choice is to select the cartridge with a closed staple height of $h_2 = 1.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.8}$$", "id": "5192094"}, {"introduction": "Once the correct device is chosen, its proper execution is paramount to forming a secure staple line.

We solve this double inequality for $x$ to determine the set of positions corresponding to underformed staples.\nThe inequality $T - x  d_{f}$ rearranges to $x > T - d_{f}$.\nThe inequality $0  T - x$ rearranges to $x  T$.\nCombining these, the positions $x$ of underformed staples must satisfy $T - d_{f}  x  T$. This defines an interval $(T - d_{f}, T)$ of length $d_f$.\n\nThe physical staple line is restricted to the domain $[0, L]$. Therefore, the set of positions of underformed staples is the intersection of the derived interval and the physical domain of the staple line: $(T - d_{f}, T) \\cap [0, L]$.
