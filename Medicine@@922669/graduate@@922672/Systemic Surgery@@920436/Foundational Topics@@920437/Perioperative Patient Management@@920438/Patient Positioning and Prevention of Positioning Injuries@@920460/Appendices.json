I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution will be developed in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the expression for the change in cerebral perfusion pressure**\n\nThe problem states that the perfusion of a vascular bed is driven by the pressure gradient between the upstream arterial inflow (MAP) and the downstream opposing pressure (ICP). This establishes the definition of Cerebral Perfusion Pressure ($CPP$) as:\n$$\nCPP = MAP - ICP\n$$\nTo find the expression for the change in $CPP$ due to small, arbitrary changes in $MAP$ and $ICP$, we can consider the total differential of the function $CPP(MAP, ICP)$.\n$$\nd(CPP) = \\frac{\\partial (CPP)}{\\partial (MAP)} d(MAP) + \\frac{\\partial (CPP)}{\\partial (ICP)} d(ICP)\n$$\nWe compute the partial derivatives from the defining equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (CPP)}{\\partial (MAP)} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (MAP)} (MAP - ICP) = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (CPP)}{\\partial (ICP)} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (ICP)} (MAP - ICP) = -1\n$$\nSubstituting these into the total differential expression gives:\n$$\nd(CPP) = (1) d(MAP) + (-1) d(ICP) = d(MAP) - d(ICP)\n$$\nFor finite changes, which we denote with the symbol $\\Delta$, this differential relationship becomes an exact algebraic relationship because the underlying function is linear. Therefore, the change in cerebral perfusion pressure, $\\Delta CPP$, is given by the change in mean arterial pressure, $\\Delta MAP$, minus the change in intracranial pressure, $\\Delta ICP$.\n$$\n\\Delta CPP = \\Delta MAP - \\Delta ICP\n$$\nThis is the required expression.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the post-tilt cerebral perfusion pressure**\n\nFirst, we calculate the baseline (pre-tilt) $CPP$ using the initial values. Let the subscript $0$ denote baseline values.\n$$\nMAP_{0} = 85\\,\\text{mmHg}\n$$\n$$\nICP_{0} = 12\\,\\text{mmHg}\n$$\nThe baseline $CPP_0$ is:\n$$\nCPP_{0} = MAP_{0} - ICP_{0} = 85 - 12 = 73\\,\\text{mmHg}\n$$\nNext, we determine the post-tilt values. The problem states that MAP is kept constant, which means the change in MAP is zero.\n$$\n\\Delta MAP = 0\n$$\nThe problem also states that the head-down tilt increases ICP by $5\\,\\text{mmHg}$.\n$$\n\\Delta ICP = +5\\,\\text{mmHg}\n$$\nWe can now calculate the change in $CPP$ using the expression derived in Part 1:\n$$\n\\Delta CPP = \\Delta MAP - \\Delta ICP = 0 - 5 = -5\\,\\text{mmHg}\n$$\nThe post-tilt $CPP$, which we denote as $CPP_{post-tilt}$, is the baseline $CPP$ plus the change in $CPP$.\n$$\nCPP_{post-tilt} = CPP_{0} + \\Delta CPP = 73 + (-5) = 68\\,\\text{mmHg}\n$$\nAlternatively, one can calculate the post-tilt values for MAP and ICP individually and then compute the post-tilt $CPP$.\n$$\nMAP_{post-tilt} = MAP_{0} + \\Delta MAP = 85 + 0 = 85\\,\\text{mmHg}\n$$\n$$\nICP_{post-tilt} = ICP_{0} + \\Delta ICP = 12 + 5 = 17\\,\\text{mmHg}\n$$\nThen, the post-tilt $CPP$ is:\n$$\nCPP_{post-tilt} = MAP_{post-tilt} - ICP_{post-tilt} = 85 - 17 = 68\\,\\text{mmHg}\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The post-tilt cerebral perfusion pressure is $68\\,\\text{mmHg}$.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of the safety margin**\n\nThe safety margin is defined as the post-tilt $CPP$ minus the lower autoregulatory limit.\nThe given lower autoregulatory limit is $50\\,\\text{mmHg}$.\n$$\n\\text{Safety Margin} = CPP_{post-tilt} - \\text{Lower Limit}\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\n\\text{Safety Margin} = 68\\,\\text{mmHg} - 50\\,\\text{mmHg} = 18\\,\\text{mmHg}\n$$\nThe safety margin is $18\\,\\text{mmHg}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{18}\n$$", "id": "5165931"}]}
