It is scientifically grounded in established principles of cardiovascular physiology, well-posed with sufficient information and clear objectives, and expressed in precise, objective language. The scenario and data provided are clinically realistic and do not violate any physical or mathematical laws. The problem is a formalizable exercise in applying a fundamental definition to a simplified, but standard, clinical model.\n\nThe primary objective is to derive an approximation for the mean arterial pressure ($MAP$) based on a set of specified assumptions, calculate its value for a given patient, and use this value to make a clinical determination.\n\nWe begin with the fundamental definition of $MAP$ as the time average of the instantaneous arterial pressure, $P(t)$, over one cardiac cycle of duration $T$:\n$$MAP = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T}P(t)\\,dt$$\n\nThe problem provides several key pieces of information to construct a simplified model:\n1.  The duration of diastole, $T_d$, is approximately twice the duration of systole, $T_s$. This can be expressed as $T_d = 2T_s$.\n2.  The total duration of the cardiac cycle, $T$, is the sum of the systolic and diastolic durations: $T = T_s + T_d$.\n3.  The pressure, $P(t)$, can be approximated by a piecewise-constant function over the cycle.\n\nUsing the relationship $T_d = 2T_s$, we can express the total cycle duration $T$ in terms of $T_s$:\n$$T = T_s + 2T_s = 3T_s$$\nFrom this, we can find the fractions of the cycle corresponding to systole and diastole:\n$$T_s = \\frac{1}{3}T$$\n$$T_d = \\frac{2}{3}T$$\n\nNext, we construct the piecewise-constant model for the instantaneous pressure $P(t)$. The simplest such model, consistent with the problem's framing, assumes the pressure is constant at the systolic blood pressure ($SBP$) throughout systole and constant at the diastolic blood pressure ($DBP$) throughout diastole. Let us define the cardiac cycle to start with systole, which lasts from $t=0$ to $t=T_s$. Diastole then follows, from $t=T_s$ to $t=T$. The model for $P(t)$ is therefore:\n$$\nP(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\nSBP  \\text{for } 0 \\le t  T_s \\\\\nDBP  \\text{for } T_s \\le t  T\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nWe now substitute this model into the integral definition of $MAP$. The integral can be split into two parts, one for systole and one for diastole:\n$$MAP = \\frac{1}{T}\\left( \\int_{0}^{T_s} P(t)\\,dt + \\int_{T_s}^{T} P(t)\\,dt \\right)$$\nSubstituting the constant pressure values for each interval:\n$$MAP = \\frac{1}{T}\\left( \\int_{0}^{T_s} SBP\\,dt + \\int_{T_s}^{T} DBP\\,dt \\right)$$\nEvaluating these simple integrals gives:\n$$MAP = \\frac{1}{T}\\left( SBP \\cdot [t]_{0}^{T_s} + DBP \\cdot [t]_{T_s}^{T} \\right)$$\n$$MAP = \\frac{1}{T}\\left( SBP \\cdot (T_s - 0) + DBP \\cdot (T - T_s) \\right)$$\nRecognizing that $(T - T_s) = T_d$, we have:\n$$MAP = \\frac{1}{T}(SBP \\cdot T_s + DBP \\cdot T_d)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $T_s$ and $T_d$ in terms of the total cycle duration $T$:\n$$MAP = \\frac{1}{T}\\left( SBP \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{3}T\\right) + DBP \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}T\\right) \\right)$$\nThe term $T$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out, yielding the desired approximation for $MAP$ in terms of $SBP$ and $DBP$:\n$$MAP = \\frac{1}{3}SBP + \\frac{2}{3}DBP$$\nThis formula is a widely used clinical heuristic, and we have derived it from first principles as requested.\n\nThe next step is to evaluate this $MAP$ for the given patient data. The noninvasive blood pressure monitoring reported:\n- Systolic Blood Pressure, $SBP = 80 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- Diastolic Blood Pressure, $DBP = 50 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$MAP = \\frac{1}{3}(80) + \\frac{2}{3}(50)$$\n$$MAP = \\frac{80}{3} + \\frac{100}{3}$$\n$$MAP = \\frac{180}{3}$$\n$$MAP = 60 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}$$\nThe problem requires rounding the calculated $MAP$ to three significant figures. The exact value is $60$, which can be expressed as $60.0$ to denote three significant figures.\nCalculated $MAP = 60.0 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\nFinally, we are asked to determine if immediate vasopressor support is indicated. The clinical guideline provided is that a $MAP$ below $65 \\, \\mathrm{mmHg}$ is associated with inadequate organ perfusion.

We will calculate these in a logical sequence based on the provided data.\n\nLet $W$ be the patient's weight, $W = 78\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n\n**1. Calculation of the PCA Demand Dose ($D_{demand}$)**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total intravenous morphine loading dose, $D_{LD}$, using the given rate, $R_{LD} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}$.\n$$D_{LD} = R_{LD} \\times W$$\n$$D_{LD} = (0.10\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}) \\times (78\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 7.8\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe PCA demand dose, $D_{demand}$, is specified as a fraction $f = 0.15$ of the loading dose $D_{LD}$.\n$$D_{demand} = f \\times D_{LD}$$\n$$D_{demand} = 0.15 \\times 7.8\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 1.17\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures. The calculated value of $1.17\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ already has three significant figures.\nThus, the PCA demand dose is $1.17\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Maximum Hourly Dose ($D_{max,h}$)**\n\nThe maximum hourly dose, $D_{max,h}$, is determined by the maximum hourly rate, $R_{max,h} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{h}$, and the patient's weight, $W$.\n$$D_{max,h} = R_{max,h} \\times W$$\n$$D_{max,h} = (0.10\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{h}) \\times (78\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 7.8\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{h}$$\nRounding this value to three significant figures gives $7.80\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{h}$.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Lockout Interval ($T_{lockout}$)**\n\nThe lockout interval, $T_{lockout}$, is the minimum time between consecutive demand doses. It is set to ensure that if the patient demands a dose as frequently as possible, the total dose delivered does not exceed the maximum hourly dose, $D_{max,h}$. This establishes a maximum rate of administration.\n\nThe maximum administration rate is given by the ratio of the demand dose to the lockout interval, $\\frac{D_{demand}}{T_{lockout}}$.\nThe maximum allowed hourly rate is $\\frac{D_{max,h}}{1\\,\\text{hour}}$ or $\\frac{D_{max,h}}{60\\,\\mathrm{min}}$.\n\nThe lockout interval must satisfy the condition:\n$$\\frac{D_{demand}}{T_{lockout}} \\le \\frac{D_{max,h}}{60\\,\\mathrm{min}}$$\nTo satisfy the problem's constraint precisely, we set the rate to its maximum permissible value:\n$$\\frac{D_{demand}}{T_{lockout}} = \\frac{D_{max,h}}{60\\,\\mathrm{min}}$$\nSolving for $T_{lockout}$:\n$$T_{lockout} = D_{demand} \\times \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{min}}{D_{max,h}}$$\nSubstituting the unrounded values for $D_{demand}$ and $D_{max,h}$:\n$$T_{lockout} = 1.17\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\times \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{min}}{7.8\\,\\mathrm{mg}}$$\n$$T_{lockout} = \\frac{70.2}{7.8}\\,\\mathrm{min} = 9\\,\\mathrm{min}$$\nRounding this result to three significant figures yields $9.00\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\n\n### Summary of Results\nThe calculated parameters for the PCA regimen, rounded to three significant figures, are:\n1.
