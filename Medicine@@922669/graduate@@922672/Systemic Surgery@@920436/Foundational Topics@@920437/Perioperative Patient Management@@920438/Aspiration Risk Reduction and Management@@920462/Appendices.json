Since outflow represents a decrease in volume, the rate of change of volume with respect to time, $\\frac{dV}{dt}$, is negative and proportional to $V$. This relationship can be formulated as a first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} = -k V(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the positive gastric emptying rate constant.\n\nTo find the expression for $V(t)$, we solve this differential equation using the method of separation of variables.

The solution is derived from the fundamental principles of fluid statics.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing equation for hydrostatic pressure. For a fluid at rest (static), the velocity is zero everywhere. The momentum balance equation for a Newtonian fluid (a form of the Navier-Stokes equation) simplifies to the Euler equation for hydrostatics when the velocity and its derivatives are set to zero. This leaves a balance between the pressure gradient force and the gravitational body force:\n$$ -\\nabla P + \\rho \\mathbf{f_b} = 0 $$\nwhere $P$ is the scalar pressure field, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, and $\\mathbf{f_b}$ is the body force per unit mass. In this case, the only body force is gravity, so $\\mathbf{f_b} = \\mathbf{g}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\nabla P = \\rho \\mathbf{g} $$\nLet's define a Cartesian coordinate system where the z-axis points vertically upward, such that the gravitational acceleration vector is $\\mathbf{g} = (0, 0, -g)$, where $g$ is the magnitude of gravitational acceleration.

To find the pressure distribution, we integrate the third equation with respect to $z$. Assuming the fluid is incompressible ($\\rho$ is constant) and the gravitational field is uniform ($g$ is constant), integrating from a reference vertical position $z_0$ with pressure $P_0$ to an arbitrary position $z$ with pressure $P(z)$ yields:\n$$ \\int_{P_0}^{P(z)} dP' = -\\int_{z_0}^{z} \\rho g dz' $$\n$$ P(z) - P_0 = -\\rho g (z - z_0) $$\nThis is the fundamental equation for hydrostatic pressure distribution. Let's set our reference point at the free surface of the intragastric fluid. We denote the vertical position of this surface as $z_{surf}$ and the pressure at this surface as $P_{surf}$. Then for any point at a vertical position $z_{GEJ}$ corresponding to the gastroesophageal junction, the pressure $P_{GEJ}$ is:\n$$ P_{GEJ} - P_{surf} = -\\rho g (z_{GEJ} - z_{surf}) $$\nLet $h_{vert} = z_{GEJ} - z_{surf}$ be the vertical separation between the GEJ and the free surface. A positive $h_{vert}$ means the GEJ is located vertically above the free surface.

The pressure at the GEJ in this position, $P_{GEJ, tilt}$, is:\n$$ P_{GEJ, tilt} = P_{surf} - \\rho g h $$\n\nChange in Hydrostatic Pressure\nThe change in hydrostatic pressure at the GEJ, $\\Delta P_{GEJ}$, is the difference between the pressure in the tilted position and the pressure in the supine position:\n$$ \\Delta P_{GEJ} = P_{GEJ, tilt} - P_{GEJ, supine} $$\n$$ \\Delta P_{GEJ} = (P_{surf} - \\rho g h) - P_{surf} $$\n$$ \\Delta P_{GEJ} = - \\rho g h $$\nThe negative sign indicates that the pressure at the GEJ decreases when the patient is moved to the head-up position.
