The derivation must be from first principles.\n\nFirst, let us define the relevant events and their probabilities based on the problem statement.\nLet $M$ be the event that the patient experiences MACE.\nLet $M^c$ be the complementary event, that the patient does not experience MACE.\nLet $+$ denote the event of a positive test result.\nLet $-$ denote the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are translated into probabilistic notation as follows:\n1.  The pretest probability of MACE, which is the prior probability of the event $M$, is given as $P(M) = p$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test, $S$, is the conditional probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the condition (MACE). Thus, $S = P(+\\mid M)$.\n3.  The specificity of the test, $C$, is the conditional probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the condition. Thus, $C = P(-\\mid M^c)$.\n\nOur objective is to find the posttest probability of MACE given a positive test, which is the conditional probability $P(M \\mid +)$.\n\nWe begin with the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nApplying this definition to our problem, the desired probability is:\n$$P(M \\mid +) = \\frac{P(M \\cap +)}{P(+)}$$\nThe joint probability in the numerator, $P(M \\cap +)$, can be expressed using the definition of conditional probability again, but rearranged: $P(+\\mid M) = \\frac{P(M \\cap +)}{P(M)}$, which gives $P(M \\cap +) = P(+\\mid M)P(M)$.\nSubstituting this into our expression for $P(M \\mid +)$, we obtain the standard form of Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(M \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+\\mid M)P(M)}{P(+)}$$\nHere, $P(+\\mid M)$ is the likelihood, $P(M)$ is the prior probability, and $P(+)$ is the marginal likelihood or evidence.\n\nThe next step is to express the evidence term, $P(+)$, in terms of the given quantities. The event $+$ can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: either the patient will experience MACE and tests positive ($M \\cap +$), or the patient will not experience MACE and tests positive ($M^c \\cap +$). By the law of total probability, we can write $P(+)$ as the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n$$P(+) = P(M \\cap +) + P(M^c \\cap +)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term, we have:\n$$P(+) = P(+\\mid M)P(M) + P(+\\mid M^c)P(M^c)$$\nNow, we must express all terms on the right-hand side using the given variables $S$, $C$, and $p$.\n- We already have $P(+\\mid M) = S$ and $P(M) = p$.\n- The probability of not having MACE is $P(M^c) = 1 - P(M) = 1 - p$.\n- The term $P(+\\mid M^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given no MACE. This is the false positive rate. It can be derived from the specificity, $C$. Since a patient without MACE can either test positive or negative, we have $P(+\\mid M^c) + P(-\\mid M^c) = 1$. Given $P(-\\mid M^c) = C$, it follows that $P(+\\mid M^c) = 1 - C$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(+)$:\n$$P(+) = S \\cdot p + (1-C)(1-p)$$\nNow, we substitute this expanded form of the evidence $P(+)$ back into the Bayes' theorem expression for $P(M \\mid +)$:\n$$P(M \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+\\mid M)P(M)}{S \\cdot p + (1-C)(1-p)}$$\nFinally, replacing the terms in the numerator with the given variables, we arrive at the required analytic expression:\n$$P(M \\mid +) = \\frac{S \\cdot p}{S \\cdot p + (1-C)(1-p)}$$\nThis equation is also known as the positive predictive value of the test.\n\nThe problem then requires us to evaluate this expression for the specific values:\n- Sensitivity $S = 0.85$\n- Specificity $C = 0.90$\n- Pretest probability $p = 0.10$\n\nWe substitute these numerical values into the derived formula:\n$$P(M \\mid +) = \\frac{0.85 \\times 0.10}{(0.85 \\times 0.10) + (1 - 0.90)(1 - 0.10)}$$\nFirst, we calculate the terms in the expression:\n- The numerator is $S \\cdot p = 0.85 \\times 0.10 = 0.085$.\n- The first term in the denominator is the same: $S \\cdot p = 0.085$.\n- The second term in the denominator is $(1-C)(1-p) = (1 - 0.90)(1 - 0.10) = 0.10 \\times 0.90 = 0.090$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values back into the fraction:\n$$P(M \\mid +) = \\frac{0.085}{0.085 + 0.090} = \\frac{0.085}{0.175}$$\nTo find the decimal value, we perform the division:\n$$P(M \\mid +) = \\frac{85}{175} = \\frac{17}{35} \\approx 0.4857142857...$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $4$, $8$, $5$, and $7$. The fifth significant figure is $1$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (truncate).\nThe final posttest probability is approximately $0.4857$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4857}$$", "id": "5173861"}, {"introduction": "Moving from statistical theory to clinical practice, we now apply these principles using a classic risk stratification tool.
