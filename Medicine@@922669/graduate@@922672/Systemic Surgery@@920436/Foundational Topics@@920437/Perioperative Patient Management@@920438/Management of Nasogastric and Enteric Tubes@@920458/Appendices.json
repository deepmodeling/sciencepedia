The problem is based on the principles of fluid dynamics, specifically the Hagen-Poiseuille law.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\nThe givens are:\n- The feeding formula is a Newtonian liquid.\n- The flow is laminar.\n- An infusion pump maintains a constant pressure difference, $\\Delta P$.\n- Two tubes are available, identical in length ($L$) and material.\n- Tube 1 has an internal radius $r_{1} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Tube 2 has an internal radius $r_{2} = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- The analysis must start from the Hagen–Poiseuille law.\n- The pressure difference $\\Delta P$, dynamic viscosity $\\eta$, and tube length $L$ are unchanged.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, using the established Hagen-Poiseuille law for laminar flow, which is a reasonable model for this scenario. The parameters provided are physically realistic for nasogastric tubes. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and all necessary information for the derivation and calculation is provided or can be logically inferred as constant. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Flow Rate Ratio\n\nThe Hagen–Poiseuille law describes the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, of a Newtonian fluid undergoing laminar flow through a rigid cylindrical tube of length $L$ and internal radius $r$. The equation is:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nwhere $\\Delta P$ is the pressure difference across the length of the tube and $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nFor the first tube with radius $r_{1}$, the volumetric flow rate $Q_{1}$ is:\n$$Q_{1} = \\frac{\\pi r_{1}^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\n\nFor the second tube with radius $r_{2}$, the volumetric flow rate $Q_{2}$ is:\n$$Q_{2} = \\frac{\\pi r_{2}^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\n\nThe problem states that the pressure difference $\\Delta P$, the dynamic viscosity $\\eta$, and the tube length $L$ are the same for both scenarios. To find the ratio $Q_{2}/Q_{1}$, we divide the expression for $Q_{2}$ by the expression for $Q_{1}$:\n$$\\frac{Q_{2}}{Q_{1}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi r_{2}^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}}{\\frac{\\pi r_{1}^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}}$$\n\nThe constant terms $\\pi$, $\\Delta P$, $8$, $\\eta$, and $L$ cancel out, leaving a simplified expression that depends only on the radii:\n$$\\frac{Q_{2}}{Q_{1}} = \\frac{r_{2}^4}{r_{1}^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}}\\right)^4$$\nThis is the derived expression for the ratio of the volumetric flow rates. This fourth-power relationship indicates that the flow rate is extremely sensitive to changes in the tube's radius.\n\n### Step 3: Numerical Calculation\n\nWe are given the radii $r_{1} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $r_{2} = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. We can now substitute these values into the derived expression. The units ($\\mathrm{mm}$) will cancel, resulting in a dimensionless quantity.\n\n$$\\frac{Q_{2}}{Q_{1}} = \\left(\\frac{1.6}{1.2}\\right)^4$$\n\nFirst, simplify the ratio of the radii:\n$$\\frac{1.6}{1.2} = \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\n\nNow, raise this ratio to the fourth power:\n$$\\frac{Q_{2}}{Q_{1}} = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^4 = \\frac{4^4}{3^4} = \\frac{256}{81}$$\n\nTo obtain the numerical value, we perform the division:\n$$\\frac{256}{81} \\approx 3.1604938...$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final ratio to four significant figures.\n$$\\frac{Q_{2}}{Q_{1}} \\approx 3.160$$\n\n### Step 4: Clinical Implications\n\nThe calculation shows that switching from a $1.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ radius tube to a $1.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ radius tube, while keeping the pressure difference constant, increases the volumetric flow rate by a factor of approximately $3.16$. The problem asks for the implications if the pump settings (which in this idealized model means constant $\\Delta P$) are not adjusted.\n\n1.  **Patient Tolerance**: An unadjusted, constant-pressure pump would deliver the enteral formula at a rate more than three times higher than the original setting. Such a rapid increase in infusion rate would overwhelm the patient's gastrointestinal absorptive and motor capacity. This is very likely to cause significant patient intolerance, manifesting as symptoms such as bloating, abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. For a post-operative patient, vomiting carries a high risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia, a serious and potentially fatal complication. Therefore, simply switching the tube without recalibrating the delivery rate is clinically dangerous. In practice, most modern enteral pumps are volumetric, meaning they maintain a constant flow rate ($Q$) rather than a constant pressure ($\\Delta P$). In that case, the pump would automatically reduce the pressure to maintain the set rate, as $\\Delta P \\propto 1/r^4$ for a fixed $Q$.\n\n2.  **Clog Risk**: The risk of tube occlusion, or clogging, is inversely related to the tube's radius. The Hagen-Poiseuille law demonstrates that resistance to flow is highly dependent on radius. The resistance $R$ can be defined as $R = \\Delta P / Q = 8 \\eta L / (\\pi r^4)$. The resistance in the smaller tube is $(4/3)^4 \\approx 3.16$ times greater than in the larger tube. A larger internal diameter ($2r$) provides more physical space, making it less likely for particulate matter in the formula to form an obstruction. Furthermore, if we consider a volumetric pump (constant $Q$), the pressure required to maintain that flow rate is much lower in the larger tube ($\\Delta P \\propto 1/r^4$). This lower driving pressure is less likely to compact particulates into a firm clog. Even in the constant-pressure model of this problem, the resulting higher flow velocity ($v = Q/A \\propto r^4/r^2 = r^2$) would help to keep particles suspended and flush them through the tube, thereby reducing the propensity for them to settle and cause a clog. Thus, using the larger tube ($r_2 = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) significantly reduces the risk of clogging.\n\nIn summary, while the larger tube reduces clog risk, the dramatic increase in flow rate under a constant-pressure system poses a significant threat to patient safety and tolerance. Any change in NGT size requires a corresponding adjustment of the infusion pump settings to ensure the prescribed volume is delivered over the intended time period.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.160}$$", "id": "5148088"}, {"introduction": "Effective management of enteral nutrition involves constant monitoring and adjustment based on the patient's response.
