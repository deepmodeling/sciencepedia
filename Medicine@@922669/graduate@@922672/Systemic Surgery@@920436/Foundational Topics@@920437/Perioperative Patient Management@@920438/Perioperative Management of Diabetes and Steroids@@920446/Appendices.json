This practice focuses on a patient with Type $1$ diabetes, for whom basal insulin is not just for glucose control but is life-sustaining to prevent ketoacidosis. The exercise challenges you to balance the competing risks of hypoglycemia—heightened by fasting, a history of low blood sugar, and chronic kidney disease—against the certain hyperglycemia that will result from surgical stress and high-dose steroids. By working through this scenario, you will practice the critical clinical judgment required to tailor a basal insulin dose that threads this fine needle, a fundamental skill in managing high-risk surgical patients [@problem_id:5169071].", "problem": "A patient with Type 1 diabetes mellitus is scheduled for an elective laparoscopic colectomy at $07:00$ hours. He is nil per os (NPO) after $00:00$. His home regimen is insulin glargine $24$ units subcutaneously at $22:00$ and insulin lispro before meals. He has chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stage $3$ with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of approximately $45 \\ \\text{mL/min/1.73 m}^2$, a history of nocturnal hypoglycemia, and a last glycated hemoglobin of $8.2\\%$. He takes prednisone $10 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$ daily for polymyalgia rheumatica. The surgical team plans perioperative stress-dose glucocorticoids: hydrocortisone $100 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$ intravenous at induction, followed by $50 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$ intravenous every $8$ hours for $24$ hours. His fasting capillary blood glucose at $05:30$ is $95 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n\nGiven the physiologic basis of basal insulin (to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, lipolysis, and ketogenesis) and the effects of fasting, surgical stress, and exogenous glucocorticoids on counterregulatory hormones and insulin sensitivity, choose the most appropriate preoperative basal insulin plan for the evening prior to surgery and immediate perioperative period. The goal is to avoid hypoglycemia while preventing ketosis and excessive hyperglycemia, with typical perioperative targets of $140-180 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$ endorsed by major societies. Consider that long-acting basal insulin should generally be continued in Type 1 diabetes, reduced proportionally when NPO, and titrated in the context of renal function and steroid-induced insulin resistance.\n\nWhich of the following plans best balances hypoglycemia risk and anticipated stress hyperglycemia in this patient?\n\nA.

The correct plan must safely navigate the patient through the perioperative period by preventing both hypoglycemia and severe hyperglycemia/ketosis.\n\n**Analysis of Patient-Specific Factors:**\n\n*   **Pro-Hypoglycemia Factors:**\n    1.  **NPO Status:** The patient is fasting, eliminating glucose intake from food. This alone necessitates a reduction in basal insulin.\n    2.  **History of Nocturnal Hypoglycemia:** This indicates the patient is sensitive to his current basal dose, even at home. This is a strong signal to be cautious.\n    3.  **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):** An eGFR of $45 \\ \\text{mL/min/1.73 m}^2$ means reduced renal clearance of insulin, prolonging its half-life and increasing hypoglycemia risk. This is another major reason for dose reduction.\n    4.  **Low-Normal Morning Glucose:** A fasting glucose of $95 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$ before surgery suggests there is little room for error; an aggressive insulin dose could easily push him into hypoglycemia.\n\n*   **Pro-Hyperglycemia Factors:**\n    1.  **Type 1 Diabetes:** The patient has no endogenous insulin to counter stress hormones. Basal insulin is essential to prevent DKA.\n    2.  **Surgical Stress:** A laparoscopic colectomy is major surgery, which will trigger a significant release of counter-regulatory hormones (cortisol, catecholamines), driving up blood glucose.\n    3.  **High-Dose Steroids:** The planned stress-dose hydrocortisone regimen is a very potent driver of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, far exceeding the effect of his home prednisone dose.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **Option A:** Administer $50\\%$ of basal insulin ($12$ units), hold dextrose, check glucose every $6$ hours, and correct only if $> 250 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n    *   **Dose:** A $50\\%$ reduction ($12$ units) is a reasonable and safe starting point given the strong pro-hypoglycemia factors (CKD, history).\n    *   **Flaws:** Withholding IV dextrose is dangerous; with a reduced but still present basal insulin dose, the patient is at high risk of hypoglycemia before the surgical stress fully kicks in. Monitoring every $6$ hours is grossly inadequate for a Type 1 diabetic undergoing major surgery. A correction threshold of $250 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$ is far too permissive and goes against the standard target of $140-180 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$. This plan is unsafe due to hypoglycemia risk and ineffective for hyperglycemia management.\n\n*   **Option B:** Administer $70\\%$ of basal insulin ($17$ units), start a D5W infusion, monitor glucose hourly, and correct with IV insulin if $> 180 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n    *   **Dose:** A $30\\%$ reduction ($17$ units) is a standard approach, balancing the NPO status against the anticipated stress. While a $50\\%$ reduction might also be defensible, $30\\%$ is a reasonable choice given the powerful hyperglycemic stimulus from the upcoming steroids.\n    *   **Strengths:** This plan correctly incorporates all essential safety components.\n        1.  **Dextrose Infusion:** The D5W provides a crucial \"safety net\" against hypoglycemia, allowing for the use of insulin to manage hyperglycemia.\n        2.  **Frequent Monitoring:** Hourly monitoring is the standard of care for this high-risk scenario, allowing for rapid detection and treatment of glucose fluctuations.\n        3.  **Appropriate Correction:** Using IV regular insulin for glucose $> 180 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$ is the correct method (IV is predictable intraoperatively) and threshold to maintain the target range.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a comprehensive, modern, and safe plan that correctly balances all risks.\n\n*   **Option C:** Administer $80\\%$ of basal insulin ($19$ units), avoid dextrose, check glucose every $4$ hours, and use subcutaneous correction if $> 200 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n    *   **Dose:** An $80\\%$ dose is a minimal reduction and is likely too high given the patient's CKD and hypoglycemia history, posing a significant risk of preoperative hypoglycemia.\n    *   **Flaws:** Avoiding IV dextrose exacerbates this risk. Monitoring every $4$ hours is insufficient. Using subcutaneous insulin for intraoperative corrections is inappropriate, as its absorption is unreliable during surgery; IV insulin is required for titratable control. The threshold of $200 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$ is too high. This plan is unsafe.\n\n*   **Option D:** Administer $100\\%$ of basal insulin ($24$ units), avoid dextrose, check glucose every $4-6$ hours, and correct if $> 250 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n    *   **Dose:** Giving the full basal dose to a fasting patient with CKD and a history of hypoglycemia is a major error and would almost certainly cause severe hypoglycemia before the surgery even begins.\n    *   **Flaws:** This plan combines the most dangerous elements of all other options: a dangerously high insulin dose, no glucose substrate, infrequent monitoring, and a permissive hyperglycemia target. This is the most dangerous and incorrect option.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nOption B is the only plan that aligns with the principles of safe and effective perioperative diabetes management. It provides a reasonable basal insulin dose, protects against hypoglycemia with a dextrose infusion, mandates appropriately frequent monitoring, and establishes a proper protocol for managing the inevitable hyperglycemia.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5169071"}, {"introduction": "Effective perioperative management requires shifting from static preoperative plans to dynamic, real-time interventions. This exercise simulates a common intraoperative event: stress hyperglycemia, often exacerbated by glucocorticoids. You will apply a typical intravenous insulin protocol, a powerful tool for achieving tight glycemic control. This hands-on calculation demonstrates how to translate a patient's current blood glucose level into a precise insulin infusion rate and then predict the expected therapeutic response, reinforcing the quantitative principles behind modern glycemic management protocols [@problem_id:5169114].", "problem": "A perioperative patient receiving systemic glucocorticoids exhibits stress hyperglycemia. In a surgical intensive care unit, an intravenous (IV) insulin infusion protocol is applied that models the basal correction rate as linearly proportional to the hyperglycemic deviation above a target setpoint. Specifically, when the capillary blood glucose is $G$ (in mg/dL) and the target setpoint is $G_{\\text{targ}}$, the infusion rate is assumed proportional to the deviation $G - G_{\\text{targ}}$ with a proportionality coefficient $c$ (in units/hour per mg/dL). For patients exposed to glucocorticoids perioperatively, empirical titration tables recommend $G_{\\text{targ}} = 150$ mg/dL and $c = 0.02$ units/hour per mg/dL. Independently, the short-term insulin sensitivity factor $S$ (in mg/dL per unit) for this patient has been empirically estimated as $S = 30$ mg/dL per unit, meaning each unit of insulin lowers glucose by $S$ mg/dL over the next hour under steady-state conditions.\n\nA patient’s measured glucose is $G = 320$ mg/dL. Starting only from the linear proportionality assumption, the target setpoint definition, and the meaning of the insulin sensitivity factor, derive the basal insulin infusion rate and the expected magnitude of the one-hour glucose change under these assumptions. Express the infusion rate in units per hour and the expected glucose change in mg/dL per hour. Report exact values; no rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of two quantities related to the management of stress hyperglycemia in a perioperative patient: the basal insulin infusion rate and the expected magnitude of the glucose change over one hour. The solution must proceed from the given principles and definitions.\n\nLet $G$ be the patient's capillary blood glucose in mg/dL, and let $G_{\\text{targ}}$ be the target glucose setpoint, also in mg/dL. Let $R$ be the intravenous insulin infusion rate in units per hour. The problem states that the infusion rate is modeled as being linearly proportional to the hyperglycemic deviation, which is the difference $G - G_{\\text{targ}}$. The constant of proportionality is given as $c$. This relationship is expressed by the equation:\n$$R = c (G - G_{\\text{targ}})$$\n\nThe problem provides the following specific values:\nThe patient's measured glucose is $G = 320 \\ \\text{mg/dL}$.\nThe recommended target setpoint is $G_{\\text{targ}} = 150 \\ \\text{mg/dL}$.\nThe proportionality coefficient is $c = 0.02 \\ \\text{units/hour per mg/dL}$.\n\nTo find the basal insulin infusion rate, we substitute these values into the governing equation:\n$$R = 0.02 \\frac{\\text{units}}{\\text{hour} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}}} \\times (320 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}} - 150 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}})$$\nFirst, we calculate the glucose deviation:\n$$G - G_{\\text{targ}} = 320 - 150 = 170 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}}$$\nNow, we calculate the infusion rate $R$:\n$$R = 0.02 \\times 170 \\frac{\\text{units}}{\\text{hour}}$$\n$$R = 3.4 \\frac{\\text{units}}{\\text{hour}}$$\nThus, the basal insulin infusion rate is $3.4$ units/hour.\n\nNext, we must derive the expected magnitude of the one-hour glucose change. The problem defines the insulin sensitivity factor, $S$, as the drop in glucose (in mg/dL) per unit of insulin administered, over one hour. The value is given as $S = 30 \\ \\text{mg/dL per unit}$.\n\nThis means that each unit of insulin is expected to lower the blood glucose by $30$ mg/dL. The rate of change of blood glucose, which can be represented as $\\frac{dG}{dt}$, is a function of the rate at which insulin is infused, $R$, and the patient's sensitivity to it, $S$. Since insulin lowers glucose, the rate of change is negative.
