The solution must be derived from first principles of mass balance and then calculated using a provided clinical assumption.\n\nFirst, let's establish the governing principle: the conservation of mass. The total mass of hemoglobin ($Hb$) in the patient's circulatory system after transfusion is equal to the initial total mass of hemoglobin plus the total mass of hemoglobin added from the transfused RBC units. We assume the patient's intravascular volume remains constant and there is no ongoing blood loss or hemolysis, as stated in the problem.\n\nLet the relevant variables be:\n- $Hb_i$: Initial hemoglobin concentration, given as $5\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}$.\n- $Hb_f$: Final (target) hemoglobin concentration, given as $8\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}$.\n- $V_B$: The patient's total blood volume in deciliters ($\\mathrm{dL}$).\n- $M_{Hb,i}$: The initial total mass of hemoglobin in the blood.\n- $M_{Hb,f}$: The final total mass of hemoglobin in the blood.\n- $N$: The number of RBC units to be transfused.\n- $M_{Hb,unit}$: The mass of hemoglobin contained in a single unit of RBCs.\n\nThe total mass of hemoglobin is the product of its concentration and the total blood volume.\nThe initial total mass of hemoglobin is:\n$$M_{Hb,i} = Hb_i \\cdot V_B$$\n\nThe final total mass of hemoglobin after transfusion is:\n$$M_{Hb,f} = Hb_f \\cdot V_B$$\n\nThe total mass of hemoglobin added through transfusion is $N \\cdot M_{Hb,unit}$. The mass balance equation is therefore:\n$$M_{Hb,f} = M_{Hb,i} + N \\cdot M_{Hb,unit}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for mass in terms of concentration, we get:\n$$Hb_f \\cdot V_B = Hb_i \\cdot V_B + N \\cdot M_{Hb,unit}$$\n\nWe can solve for the number of units, $N$:\n$$(Hb_f - Hb_i) \\cdot V_B = N \\cdot M_{Hb,unit}$$\n$$N = \\frac{(Hb_f - Hb_i) \\cdot V_B}{M_{Hb,unit}}$$\n\nThis equation, derived from first principles, provides the general relationship between the required change in $Hb$ concentration and the number of RBC units.\n\nThe problem then provides a key clinical assumption: \"one unit of packed red blood cells increases $Hb$ by $1\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}$\". Let's represent this increase as $\\Delta Hb_{unit}$.\n$$\\Delta Hb_{unit} = 1\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}$$\n\nThis assumption simplifies the calculation. The total required increase in hemoglobin concentration is:\n$$\\Delta Hb_{total} = Hb_f - Hb_i = 8\\,\\mathrm{g/dL} - 5\\,\\mathrm{g/dL} = 3\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}$$\n\nThe number of units, $N$, can be found by dividing the total required increase in concentration by the increase per unit:\n$$N = \\frac{\\Delta Hb_{total}}{\\Delta Hb_{unit}}$$\n\nBefore calculating the final number, it is instructive to demonstrate how the first-principles derivation relates to this clinical rule of thumb. The increase in $Hb$ concentration from one unit, $\\Delta Hb_{unit}$, can be expressed from our derived equation by setting $N=1$:\n$$\\Delta Hb_{unit} = \\frac{M_{Hb,unit}}{V_B}$$\nFor a standard adult, blood volume is estimated at approximately $70\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$. For the given $65\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ patient, the estimated blood volume is:\n$$V_B = 65\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 70\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg} = 4550\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 45.5\\,\\mathrm{dL}$$\nA standard unit of PRBCs contains approximately $50\\,\\mathrm{g}$ to $60\\,\\mathrm{g}$ of hemoglobin. Using a representative value of $M_{Hb,unit} \\approx 50\\,\\mathrm{g}$, we can estimate the expected increase in $Hb$:\n$$\\Delta Hb_{unit} = \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{g}}{45.5\\,\\mathrm{dL}} \\approx 1.1\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}$$\nThis theoretical calculation is in close agreement with the clinical rule of thumb of $1\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}$ per unit, validating the assumption from a first-principles perspective. The patient's weight of $65\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ is close enough to the \"average adult\" for this assumption to be applicable.\n\nNow, we proceed with the calculation as specified by the problem, using the provided clinical assumption.\nGiven:\n- Required increase in hemoglobin concentration, $\\Delta Hb_{total} = 3\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}$.\n- Hemoglobin increase per unit of RBCs, $\\Delta Hb_{unit} = 1\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}$.\n\nThe number of units required is:\n$$N = \\frac{3\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}}{1\\,\\mathrm{g/dL/unit}} = 3\\,\\text{units}$$\n\nThe calculation results in exactly $3$ units.
