A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe derivation proceeds from the first principle of equianalgesia, which allows for the calculation of equivalent doses between different opioids and routes of administration through potency ratios.\n\nLet $D_{\\text{HM, IV}}$ be the total daily dose of IV hydromorphone, which is given as $6$ mg.\nLet $D_{\\text{M, IV}}$ be the equianalgesic daily dose of IV morphine.\nLet $D_{\\text{M, PO, equi}}$ be the equianalgesic daily dose of oral morphine before adjustment.\nLet $D_{\\text{M, PO, final}}$ be the final adjusted daily dose of oral morphine.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Equianalgesic Oral Morphine Dose**\n\nThe conversion from the patient's current IV hydromorphone dose to an equianalgesic oral morphine dose can be performed in two steps, using the provided potency information.\n\nFirst, we convert the IV hydromorphone dose to an equianalgesic IV morphine dose. The problem states that $1.5$ mg of IV hydromorphone is equianalgesic to $10$ mg of IV morphine. This establishes a potency ratio, $R_1$:\n$$\nR_1 = \\frac{10 \\text{ mg IV morphine}}{1.5 \\text{ mg IV hydromorphone}}\n$$\nThe equianalgesic IV morphine dose, $D_{\\text{M, IV}}$, is found by multiplying the current IV hydromorphone dose by this ratio:\n$$\nD_{\\text{M, IV}} = D_{\\text{HM, IV}} \\times R_1 = 6 \\text{ mg} \\times \\frac{10}{1.5} = 40 \\text{ mg}\n$$\n\nSecond, we convert this IV morphine dose to an equianalgesic oral morphine dose. The problem states that $10$ mg of IV morphine is equianalgesic to $30$ mg of oral morphine. This bioavailability and potency ratio, $R_2$, is:\n$$\nR_2 = \\frac{30 \\text{ mg oral morphine}}{10 \\text{ mg IV morphine}} = 3\n$$\nThe equianalgesic oral morphine dose, $D_{\\text{M, PO, equi}}$, is found by multiplying the equianalgesic IV morphine dose by this ratio:\n$$\nD_{\\text{M, PO, equi}} = D_{\\text{M, IV}} \\times R_2 = 40 \\text{ mg} \\times 3 = 120 \\text{ mg}\n$$\nAlternatively, we can combine these steps by establishing a single conversion factor from IV hydromorphone to oral morphine. By transitivity of equianalgesia:\n$1.5$ mg IV hydromorphone $\\Leftrightarrow$ $10$ mg IV morphine\n$10$ mg IV morphine $\\Leftrightarrow$ $30$ mg oral morphine\nTherefore, $1.5$ mg IV hydromorphone $\\Leftrightarrow$ $30$ mg oral morphine.\nThe combined ratio, $R_{\\text{total}}$, is:\n$$\nR_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{30 \\text{ mg oral morphine}}{1.5 \\text{ mg IV hydromorphone}} = 20\n$$\nUsing this direct ratio, we calculate the equianalgesic oral morphine dose from the initial dose:\n$$\nD_{\\text{M, PO, equi}} = D_{\\textHM, IV} \\times R_{\\text{total}} = 6 \\text{ mg} \\times 20 = 120 \\text{ mg}\n$$\nBoth methods correctly yield an equianalgesic oral morphine dose of $120$ mg.\n\n**Part 2: Application of Dose Reduction for Incomplete Cross-Tolerance**\n\nWhen switching between opioids, patients may be more sensitive to the new opioid than suggested by equianalgesic tables. This phenomenon is known as incomplete cross-tolerance. To mitigate the risk of overdose, a prophylactic dose reduction is standard practice.\n\nThe problem specifies a reduction equal to a fraction of $0.33$ of the calculated equianalgesic dose. Let this fraction be $f = 0.33$. The amount of dose reduction, $\\Delta D$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta D = D_{\\text{M, PO, equi}} \\times f = 120 \\text{ mg} \\times 0.33\n$$\nThe final dose, $D_{\\text{M, PO, final}}$, is the equianalgesic dose minus this reduction:\n$$\nD_{\\text{M, PO, final}} = D_{\\text{M, PO, equi}} - \\Delta D = D_{\\text{M, PO, equi}} - (D_{\\text{M, PO, equi}} \\times f)\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nD_{\\text{M, PO, final}} = D_{\\text{M, PO, equi}} \\times (1 - f)\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nD_{\\text{M, PO, final}} = 120 \\text{ mg} \\times (1 - 0.33) = 120 \\text{ mg} \\times 0.67\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\text{M, PO, final}} = 80.4 \\text{ mg}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Final Answer Formatting**\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $80.4$ mg, which already has three significant figures ($8$, $0$, and $4$). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.
