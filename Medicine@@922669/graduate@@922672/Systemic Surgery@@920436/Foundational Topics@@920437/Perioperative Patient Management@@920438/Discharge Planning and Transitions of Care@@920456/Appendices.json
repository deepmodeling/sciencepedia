On the day of discharge, his labs show Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) $=115\\,\\mathrm{U/L}$ with an upper limit of normal $40\\,\\mathrm{U/L}$, Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) $=98\\,\\mathrm{U/L}$ with an upper limit of normal $41\\,\\mathrm{U/L}$, total bilirubin $=1.0\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, serum albumin $=3.2\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}$, serum creatinine $=1.50\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ (baseline preoperative serum creatinine $=1.10\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$), and blood urea nitrogen $=24\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.

Base your decision on first principles of hepatic and renal physiology and on widely accepted, guideline-consistent dose limits and renal function thresholds. Proceed as follows:\n\n1. Estimate the patient’s glomerular filtration rate using the $2021$ Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) race-free creatinine equation from serum creatinine and age, and classify the degree of renal impairment. Assume no race coefficient.\n2.

The $2021$ Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) race-free creatinine equation is used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). For a male with $\\text{SCr} > 0.9\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, the equation is:\n$$ \\text{eGFR} = 142 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{SCr}}{0.9} \\right)^{-1.200} \\times 0.9938^{\\text{Age}} $$\nSubstituting the patient's data, where Age $= 62$ years and SCr $= 1.50\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$:\n$$ \\text{eGFR} = 142 \\times \\left( \\frac{1.50}{0.9} \\right)^{-1.200} \\times 0.9938^{62} $$\nThe ratio of creatinine values is:\n$$ \\frac{1.50}{0.9} \\approx 1.6667 $$\nCalculating the components of the equation:\n$$ (1.6667)^{-1.200} \\approx 0.5173 $$\n$$ 0.9938^{62} \\approx 0.6808 $$\nTherefore, the estimated GFR is:\n$$ \\text{eGFR} \\approx 142 \\times 0.5173 \\times 0.6808 \\approx 49.99\\,\\mathrm{mL/min/1.73m^2} $$\nAccording to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, an eGFR between $45$ and $59\\,\\mathrm{mL/min/1.73m^2}$ corresponds to Stage $3a$ Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), indicating moderate renal impairment. Furthermore, the patient's serum creatinine has increased from a preoperative baseline of $1.10\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ to $1.50\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ postoperatively, an increase of $0.40\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. This meets the criteria for Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), which is often defined as an increase in SCr by $\\ge 0.3\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ within $48$ hours. The patient thus has an AKI superimposed on pre-existing moderate renal impairment.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of Maximum Daily Acetaminophen Dose**\n\nAcetaminophen is metabolized primarily in the liver via glucuronidation and sulfation. A minor fraction, typically $<10\\%$, is oxidized by cytochrome P$450$ enzymes (predominantly CYP2E1) to a highly reactive, toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with glutathione. When glutathione stores are depleted, as can occur in an overdose or in states of malnutrition or chronic liver disease, NAPQI accumulates and causes centrilobular hepatic necrosis.\n\nThe patient presents with elevated liver transaminases (AST $= 115\\,\\mathrm{U/L}$ or $\\approx 2.9$ times the upper limit of normal; ALT $= 98\\,\\mathrm{U/L}$ or $\\approx 2.4$ times the upper limit of normal) and a history of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). These findings indicate active, albeit mild-to-moderate, hepatocellular injury. However, there is no evidence of severe hepatic synthetic dysfunction or cholestasis, as the total bilirubin is normal ($1.0\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$) and serum albumin is only mildly decreased ($3.2\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}$).\n\nThe standard maximum daily dose for acetaminophen in healthy adults is $4000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. However, in patients with chronic liver disease or evidence of active liver injury, a more conservative approach is warranted to prevent further hepatic damage. Clinical guidelines and expert consensus recommend reducing the maximum daily dose to $2000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ to $3000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ in such patients. Given the active hepatocellular injury evident from the laboratory values and the underlying NAFLD, selecting a conservative maximum dose is prudent to minimize risk. Therefore, a maximum daily dose of $2000\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$ is the safest and most appropriate choice. This provides a substantial margin of safety against glutathione depletion while still offering effective analgesia as part of a multimodal regimen. This corresponds to $2.000 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$ when expressed to four significant figures.\n\n**Part 3: Determination of Maximum Daily Ibuprofen Dose**\n\nNon-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen exert their effect by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby blocking the synthesis of prostaglandins. In the kidney, prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGI2) play a critical homeostatic role by inducing vasodilation of the afferent glomerular arteriole. This action is essential for maintaining renal blood flow and glomerular filtration pressure, particularly in states of renal hypoperfusion or reduced effective circulatory volume, such as the postoperative period.\n\nThe patient has several significant risk factors for NSAID-induced nephrotoxicity:\n1.  **Impaired Renal Function**: His eGFR is $\\approx 50\\,\\mathrm{mL/min/1.73m^2}$, and he has an active AKI. In this state, the kidney is highly dependent on prostaglandin-mediated afferent vasodilation to maintain GFR.\n2.  **Concomitant Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Blockade**: The patient takes losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Angiotensin II preferentially constricts the efferent arteriole to maintain glomerular filtration pressure in hypoperfused states. Blocking this effect with an ARB makes the GFR even more dependent on afferent arteriole tone.\n3.  **Postoperative Status**: The recent surgery is a state of physiological stress associated with fluid shifts and potential for volume depletion, which activates neurohumoral vasoconstrictor systems (e.g., RAAS, sympathetic nervous system) and increases reliance on local prostaglandin synthesis.\n\nAdministering an NSAID in this context would block the compensatory vasodilation of the afferent arteriole. In conjunction with the ARB's blockade of efferent arteriole constriction, this \"double hit\" would severely compromise the kidney's autoregulatory capacity, leading to a high probability of worsening his AKI. This combination of risk factors constitutes a strong contraindication to the use of NSAIDs.\n\nTherefore, ibuprofen must be excluded from his discharge analgesic plan to prevent further renal injury. The safe maximum daily dose is $0\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\n\nThe safe maximum daily dose for acetaminophen is $2000\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\nThe safe maximum daily dose for ibuprofen is $0\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\nThe final answer vector is $\\big[$acetaminophen dose, ibuprofen dose$\\big]$.\nThe acetaminophen dose, expressed to four significant figures as requested, is $2.000 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$.

The home nutrition plan must be justified from accepted surgical nutrition principles and then operationalized using the constraints below. For purposes of numerical calculation in this scenario of catabolic stress with normal renal function, use a daily energy target of $30\\,\\mathrm{kcal/kg/day}$ and a daily protein target of $1.8\\,\\mathrm{g/kg/day}$.\n\nOral intake at home is expected to be three small meals per day; each served meal contains $600\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$ and $25\\,\\mathrm{g}$ of protein, but the patient is expected to consume only $60\\%$ of each meal.

The patient is in a catabolic state due to major surgery and sepsis. This triggers a systemic inflammatory response, leading to hypermetabolism and hypercatabolism. Energy expenditure increases, and there is significant breakdown of endogenous protein, primarily from skeletal muscle, to supply amino acids for gluconeogenesis, synthesis of acute-phase proteins, and immune cell proliferation. Without adequate nutritional support, this leads to malnutrition, muscle wasting, impaired wound healing, and compromised immune function. The energy target of $30\\,\\mathrm{kcal/kg/day}$ is appropriate to meet the increased metabolic demands. The protein target of $1.8\\,\\mathrm{g/kg/day}$ is necessary to counteract the high rate of protein breakdown, promote a positive nitrogen balance, and support vital synthetic functions.

Calculate the Nutritional Deficit**\nThe deficit is the difference between the total daily target and the total daytime intake. This amount must be supplied by the nocturnal enteral feeding.\n\n-   **Energy Deficit:**\n    $$E_{deficit} = E_{target} - E_{day} = 2100 - 1900 = 200\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$$\n-   **Protein Deficit:**\n    $$P_{deficit} = P_{target} - P_{day} = 126 - 115 = 11\\,\\mathrm{g}$$\n\n**4. Determine the Minimum Volume of Nocturnal Enteral Feed**\nLet $V$ be the total volume of enteral formula in $\\mathrm{mL}$ required to meet the deficits.

Therefore, we must choose the larger of the two values.\n$$V_{min} = \\max(166.\\overline{6}, 220) = 220\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nThus, a minimum volume of $220\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ is required.

This is acceptable, as the goal is to meet or exceed targets.\n\n**5. Calculate the Minimal Constant Infusion Rate**\nThe minimal volume, $V_{min} = 220\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, is to be infused over the nightly window of $T = 10\\,\\mathrm{h}$.

This method adjusts for the hospital's specific case-mix (i.e., the distribution of patients across different risk strata) before comparing its performance to a national benchmark.\n\nThe core of indirect standardization is the calculation of the Standardized Readmission Ratio (SRR). The SRR is the ratio of the total number of observed readmissions in the hospital to the total number of expected readmissions. The expected number of readmissions is calculated by applying the stratum-specific national readmission probabilities to the hospital's patient population in each stratum.\n\nThe formula for the SRR is:\n$$\n\\text{SRR} = \\frac{\\text{Total Observed Readmissions}}{\\text{Total Expected Readmissions}} = \\frac{O}{E}\n$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of observed readmissions, $O$, by summing the observed readmissions across all four strata.\n$$\nO = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} o_{j} = o_1 + o_2 + o_3 + o_4\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nO = 22 + 28 + 15 + 10 = 75\n$$\nSo, the total number of observed readmissions is $75$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of expected readmissions, $E$. This is the number of readmissions that would be expected in the hospital's patient population if it experienced the same stratum-specific risks as the national population. For each stratum $j$, the expected number of readmissions is the number of hospital discharges, $n_j$, multiplied by the national expected probability for that stratum, $p_j$.\n$$\nE_j = n_j \\times p_j\n$$\nThe total expected readmissions, $E$, is the sum of the expected readmissions across all strata.\n$$\nE = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} E_j = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} n_j p_j = n_1 p_1 + n_2 p_2 + n_3 p_3 + n_4 p_4\n$$\nSubstituting the given values for each stratum:\n*   Stratum 1: $E_1 = 420 \\times 0.05 = 21.0$\n*   Stratum 2: $E_2 = 180 \\times 0.11 = 19.8$\n*   Stratum 3: $E_3 = 100 \\times 0.18 = 18.0$\n*   Stratum 4: $E_4 = 60 \\times 0.24 = 14.4$\n\nSumming these expected values:\n$$\nE = 21.0 + 19.8 + 18.0 + 14.4 = 73.2\n$$\nSo, the total number of expected readmissions is $73.2$.\n\nNow we can calculate the Standardized Readmission Ratio (SRR):\n$$\n\\text{SRR} = \\frac{O}{E} = \\frac{75}{73.2}\n$$\n\nThe final step is to calculate the risk-adjusted readmission rate.
