The pharmacy proposes a bag containing dextrose and crystalline amino acids along with electrolytes. The bag has the following composition: $150$ g dextrose, $60$ g amino acids, and electrolytes contributing a labeled total of $200$ milliosmoles in a total volume of $1.5$ liters. For this calculation, assume the following contribution coefficients: dextrose contributes $5$ milliosmoles per gram, amino acids contribute $10$ milliosmoles per gram, and electrolytes contribute their labeled milliosmoles as provided.
