The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in established clinical nutrition principles, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is stated objectively.\n\nFirst, we determine the fractional percent weight loss. The problem states this is to be calculated over a $3$-month interval.\nLet the preoperative baseline body weight be $W_0$ and the current body weight be $W_f$.\nThe given values are:\n$W_0 = 80\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n$W_f = 72\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n\nThe weight loss, denoted as $\\Delta W$, is the difference between the initial and final weights:\n$$ \\Delta W = W_0 - W_f = 80\\ \\mathrm{kg} - 72\\ \\mathrm{kg} = 8\\ \\mathrm{kg} $$\nThe fractional weight loss is the ratio of the weight loss to the initial weight. This corresponds to the request for the \"fractional percent weight loss as a decimal\".\n$$ \\text{Fractional Weight Loss} = \\frac{\\Delta W}{W_0} = \\frac{W_0 - W_f}{W_0} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Weight Loss} = \\frac{8\\ \\mathrm{kg}}{80\\ \\mathrm{kg}} = 0.1 $$\nThe problem requires this decimal to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is $1$. To have four significant figures, we must add three zeros after it.\n$$ \\text{Fractional Weight Loss (rounded)} = 0.1000 $$\n\nNext, we determine the overall numeric MUST score. The MUST score is the sum of scores from three distinct steps.\n\nStep 1: Body Mass Index (BMI) Score\nThe BMI is calculated using the patient's current weight $W_f$ and height $H$.\nGiven: $W_f = 72\\ \\mathrm{kg}$ and $H = 1.78\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\nThe formula for BMI is:\n$$ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{W_f}{H^2} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{72}{(1.78)^2} = \\frac{72}{3.1684} \\approx 22.723\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2} $$\nThe MUST score for BMI ($S_{\\text{BMI}}$) is assigned based on the following standard categories:\n- Score $0$ for BMI $> 20.0\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$\n- Score $1$ for BMI in the range $18.5 - 20.0\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$\n- Score $2$ for BMI $< 18.5\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$\nSince the calculated BMI of approximately $22.72$ is greater than $20.0$, the score for this step is:\n$$ S_{\\text{BMI}} = 0 $$\n\nStep 2: Unplanned Weight Loss Score\nThis score is based on the percentage of unplanned weight loss over the preceding $3-6$ months. The percentage weight loss is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{Percentage Weight Loss} = \\frac{\\Delta W}{W_0} \\times 100\\% $$\nUsing the previously calculated fractional loss:\n$$ \\text{Percentage Weight Loss} = 0.1 \\times 100\\% = 10\\% $$\nThe time frame is given as $3$ months, which falls within the $3-6$ month window. The MUST score for weight loss ($S_{\\text{WL}}$) is assigned as follows:\n- Score $0$ for weight loss $< 5\\%$\n- Score $1$ for weight loss of $5-10\\%$\n- Score $2$ for weight loss $> 10\\%$\nThe calculated weight loss is exactly $10\\%$. The category \"$5-10\\%$\" is inclusive of its endpoints. Therefore, the score for this step is:\n$$ S_{\\text{WL}} = 1 $$\n\nStep 3: Acute Disease Effect Score\nA score of $2$ is added if the patient is acutely ill and there has been, or is likely to be, no nutritional intake for more than $5$ days. The problem states that the patient is undergoing an elective procedure and \"is not expected to have $>\\!5$ days without nutritional intake around the planned operation\". This indicates the patient is not acutely ill in the context of the MUST tool, and the nutritional intake condition for a score of $2$ is not met. Thus, the acute disease effect score ($S_{\\text{ADE}}$) is:\n$$ S_{\\text{ADE}} = 0 $$\n\nFinally, the overall numeric MUST score ($S_{\\text{MUST}}$) is the sum of the scores from the three steps:\n$$ S_{\\text{MUST}} = S_{\\text{BMI}} + S_{\\text{WL}} + S_{\\text{ADE}} $$\nSubstituting the scores:\n$$ S_{\\text{MUST}} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 $$\n\nThe two required values are the fractional weight loss expressed as a decimal to four significant figures ($0.1000$) and the numeric MUST score ($1$). These are to be reported in a two-entry row matrix.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 0.1000 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "5157450"}, {"introduction": "While foundational metrics like $BMI$ are useful, a skilled practitioner must recognize and correct for clinical confounders.
