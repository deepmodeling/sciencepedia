It is a standard, non-trivial problem in physiology that is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Alveolar Gas Equation**\n\nThe derivation proceeds by quantifying the partial pressure of oxygen at sequential points in the respiratory system.\n\n1.  **Inspired Air**: Air inspired from the environment is first humidified in the upper airways, becoming saturated with water vapor at body temperature. According to Dalton’s law of partial pressures, the total pressure ($P_{atm}$) is the sum of the partial pressures of the constituent gases. The pressure available to the dry gases (oxygen, nitrogen, etc.) is the barometric pressure minus the partial pressure of water vapor ($P_{H_2O}$).\n    $$P_{\\text{dry gas}} = P_{atm} - P_{H_2O}$$\n    The partial pressure of inspired oxygen, denoted $P_I\\mathrm{O}_2$, is the fraction of inspired oxygen ($Fi\\mathrm{O}_2$) multiplied by this corrected pressure.\n    $$P_I\\mathrm{O}_2 = Fi\\mathrm{O}_2 (P_{atm} - P_{H_2O})$$\n\n2.  **Alveolar Air**: In the alveoli, gas exchange occurs. Oxygen continuously diffuses from the alveolar gas into the pulmonary capillary blood, while carbon dioxide diffuses in the opposite direction. This process lowers the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen ($P_A\\mathrm{O}_2$) relative to the inspired partial pressure ($P_I\\mathrm{O}_2$) and increases the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide ($P_A\\mathrm{CO}_2$) from virtually zero in inspired air.\n\n3.  **Mass Balance and the Respiratory Exchange Ratio**: The relationship between carbon dioxide production ($\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{CO}_2}$) and oxygen consumption ($\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$) is defined by the respiratory exchange ratio, $R$.\n    $$R = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{CO}_2}}{\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}}$$\n    In a steady state, the partial pressure of any gas in the alveoli is proportional to its fractional concentration, which is determined by the balance between its delivery via ventilation and its removal or addition via gas exchange. The drop in oxygen partial pressure from inspired to alveolar gas is caused by oxygen uptake into the blood. This drop is related to the rise in carbon dioxide partial pressure. The increase in partial pressure from $CO_2$ entering the alveoli effectively \"displaces\" an amount of oxygen. The magnitude of this effect is scaled by the respiratory exchange ratio. Specifically, the volume of $O_2$ consumed is $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{CO}_2}}{R}$. Since partial pressure is proportional to volume fraction (or mole fraction), the drop in $O_2$ partial pressure is equal to the increase in $CO_2$ partial pressure divided by $R$.\n    $$P_A\\mathrm{O}_2 = P_I\\mathrm{O}_2 - (\\text{drop in } O_{2} \\text{ pressure due to uptake})$$\n    $$P_A\\mathrm{O}_2 = P_I\\mathrm{O}_2 - \\frac{P_A\\mathrm{CO}_2}{R}$$\n    This is the simplified alveolar gas equation, which neglects a small correction factor that becomes relevant at high $Fi\\mathrm{O}_2$. For room air, this form is highly accurate.\n\n4.  **Final Form**: Substituting the expression for $P_I\\mathrm{O}_2$ into the equation gives:\n    $$P_A\\mathrm{O}_2 = Fi\\mathrm{O}_2 (P_{atm} - P_{H_2O}) - \\frac{P_A\\mathrm{CO}_2}{R}$$\n    In clinical practice, it is assumed that alveolar $P_A\\mathrm{CO}_2$ is equal to arterial $P_a\\mathrm{CO}_2$, as $CO_2$ equilibrates very rapidly across the alveolar-capillary membrane. The problem provides $P_a\\mathrm{CO}_2$, implying this standard approximation.\n    $$P_A\\mathrm{CO}_2 \\approx P_a\\mathrm{CO}_2$$\n    Therefore, the final relationship to be used is:\n    $$P_A\\mathrm{O}_2 = Fi\\mathrm{O}_2 (P_{atm} - P_{H_2O}) - \\frac{P_a\\mathrm{CO}_2}{R}$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now substitute the given values into the derived equation.\n- $Fi\\mathrm{O}_2 = 0.21$\n- $P_{atm} = 760$ mmHg\n- $P_{H_2O} = 47$ mmHg\n- $P_a\\mathrm{CO}_2 = 40$ mmHg\n- $R = 0.8$\n\n$$P_A\\mathrm{O}_2 = 0.21 \\times (760 - 47) - \\frac{40}{0.8}$$\nFirst, calculate the terms within the parentheses and the fraction:\n$$P_A\\mathrm{O}_2 = 0.21 \\times (713) - 50$$\nNext, perform the multiplication:\n$$0.21 \\times 713 = 149.73$$\nNow, substitute this result back into the equation:\n$$P_A\\mathrm{O}_2 = 149.73 - 50$$\nFinally, perform the subtraction:\n$$P_A\\mathrm{O}_2 = 99.73 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value of $99.73$ already has four significant figures.\n\nThus, the calculated alveolar partial pressure of oxygen is $99.73$ mmHg.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{99.73}$$", "id": "5177148"}, {"introduction": "Beyond assessing baseline function, preoperative planning for lung resection requires predicting the patient's future pulmonary reserve.

It is free from contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary cause of hypoxemia during one-lung ventilation (OLV) is a large intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt. Blood continues to perfuse the non-ventilated, collapsed nondependent lung, mixing deoxygenated venous blood with oxygenated blood from the ventilated dependent lung. The arterial oxygen saturation is determined by the magnitude of this shunt. The management of OLV-induced hypoxemia follows a hierarchical algorithm, addressing the most common and easily reversible causes first. The patient's $Fi\\mathrm{O}_2$ is already $1.0$, and hemodynamics are stable, so the focus is on a respiratory cause.\n\n1.  **Rule out DLT Malposition**: The most common cause of sudden, severe hypoxemia after initiating OLV is a malpositioned double-lumen tube. The tube could have migrated, causing obstruction of a lobe in the dependent lung (increasing atelectasis and shunt in the \"good\" lung) or loss of lung separation. Despite initial correct placement, manipulation during surgical positioning can cause displacement. Therefore, the **highest-priority action** is to confirm the DLT's position using a fiberoptic bronchoscope.\n\n2.  **Optimize Ventilation of the Dependent Lung**: If the DLT position is correct, the next step is to improve gas exchange in the ventilated (dependent) lung. In the lateral decubitus position, this lung is prone to compression atelectasis due to the weight of the mediastinum and the upward pressure from abdominal contents. This atelectasis creates low $\\dot{V}_A/\\dot{Q}$ regions and shunt within the dependent lung itself. The strategy is to:\n    *   Perform a **recruitment maneuver (RM)**. This involves a transient, high-pressure inflation (e.g., airway pressure of $30-40$ $\\mathrm{cmH_2O}$ for $30-40$ seconds) to reopen collapsed alveoli.\n    *   Apply an appropriate level of **PEEP**. After recruitment, PEEP is essential to prevent the newly opened alveoli from re-collapsing at end-expiration. The starting PEEP of $5$ $\\mathrm{cmH_2O}$ may be insufficient. Titrating PEEP upwards (e.g., to $8$ $\\mathrm{cmH_2O}$) is a logical next step to find the optimal level that improves oxygenation without causing overdistention and hemodynamic compromise.\n\n3.  **Address Perfusion of the Nondependent Lung**: If hypoxemia persists, the focus shifts to the non-ventilated (nondependent) lung. The goal is to reduce the shunt flow through this lung.\n    *   **Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction (HPV)**: This natural reflex constricts blood vessels in hypoxic lung regions, diverting blood to better-ventilated areas. It is crucial for limiting shunt during OLV. One must ensure that no intravenously administered vasodilators (e.g., nitroglycerin, nitroprusside) are being used, as they inhibit HPV and worsen the shunt.\n    *   **Apply CPAP to the Nondependent Lung**: A low level of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), typically $2-5$ $\\mathrm{cmH_2O}$ with $100\\%$ oxygen, can be applied to the nondependent lung. This insufflates a small amount of oxygen, which can partially oxygenate the blood perfusing that lung, thereby converting a pure shunt into a low $\\dot{V}_A/\\dot{Q}$ unit and improving overall $S_pO_2$. The pressure must be low to avoid re-inflating the lung and interfering with surgery.\n\n4.  **Rescue Maneuvers**: If profound hypoxemia continues despite these measures, more drastic steps are needed.\n    *   **Briefly resume two-lung ventilation**: This is a temporary measure to quickly restore oxygenation. The surgeon must be notified, and the procedure is paused. After the patient is stabilized, OLV can be re-attempted.\n    *   **Surgical Clamping**: In refractory cases, the surgeon can clamp the pulmonary artery of the nondependent lung, which completely eliminates the shunt.\n\nBased on this physiological reasoning, the ideal sequence of interventions is: check DLT position, optimize dependent lung mechanics (RM then PEEP titration), apply CPAP to the nondependent lung, and finally, use two-lung ventilation as a rescue.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Verify DLT position with fiberoptic bronchoscopy; transiently increase $Fi\\mathrm{O}_2$ to $1.0$ if not already; perform a recruitment maneuver of the dependent lung followed by PEEP titration to $5$–$8$ $\\mathrm{cmH_2O}$; if desaturation persists, apply continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) $2$–$5$ $\\mathrm{cmH_2O}$ with oxygen to the nondependent lung via a separate circuit; avoid systemic vasodilators; consider brief two-lung ventilation if needed, then resume OLV.**\n\nThis option follows the standard, physiologically sound, and hierarchical algorithm exactly. It prioritizes checking for a mechanical cause (DLT position), then optimizes the ventilated lung (RM + PEEP), then addresses the shunting lung (CPAP), and keeps rescue maneuvers (TLV) for last. The pressure and PEEP ranges are appropriate. The mention of avoiding vasodilators is a key physiological point related to preserving HPV.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Immediately increase tidal volume to $10$–$12$ $\\mathrm{mL \\cdot kg^{-1}}$ predicted body weight and apply PEEP $10$–$12$ $\\mathrm{cmH_2O}$ to the nondependent lung to splint it open; avoid CPAP because it worsens shunt; do not perform bronchoscopy.**\n\nThis option is flawed in multiple ways. Increasing tidal volume to $10-12$ $\\mathrm{mL \\cdot kg^{-1}}$ violates the principle of lung-protective ventilation and risks iatrogenic injury to the single ventilated lung. Applying high PEEP ($10-12$ $\\mathrm{cmH_2O}$) to the nondependent lung would reinflate it, making surgery impossible. The statement that CPAP worsens shunt is factually incorrect; it is a treatment for shunt. Omitting bronchoscopy ignores the most common correctable cause.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Administer intravenous nitroprusside to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and thereby improve perfusion of the ventilated lung; reduce $Fi\\mathrm{O}_2$ to $0.6$ to augment HPV; avoid recruitment maneuvers to prevent barotrauma; continue OLV without CPAP or PEEP changes.**\n\nThis option is dangerous. Nitroprusside is a non-selective vasodilator that will inhibit HPV, increase shunt flow, and catastrophically worsen hypoxemia. Reducing $Fi\\mathrm{O}_2$ to $0.6$ in the face of an $S_pO_2$ of $88\\%$ is contraindicated and would severely lower arterial oxygen content. While HPV is slightly attenuated by $Fi\\mathrm{O}_2=1.0$, the benefit of maximal inspired oxygen far outweighs this minor effect. Avoiding recruitment maneuvers and making no changes to PEEP or CPAP represents inaction in the face of a problem that requires intervention.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Apply CPAP $10$–$15$ $\\mathrm{cmH_2O}$ with air ($Fi\\mathrm{O}_2$ $0.21$) to the nondependent lung to prevent mediastinal shift; set the dependent lung to zero end-expiratory pressure; hyperventilate to lower arterial carbon dioxide tension ($P_a\\mathrm{CO_2}$; Partial Pressure of Arterial Carbon Dioxide) to $25$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ to increase oxygen delivery.**\n\nEvery intervention proposed here is incorrect. CPAP of $10-15$ $\\mathrm{cmH_2O}$ is too high and will interfere with surgery. Using air ($Fi\\mathrm{O}_2$ $0.21$) for CPAP is ineffective, as the goal is to oxygenate shunted blood. Setting PEEP to zero (ZEEP) on the dependent lung will promote atelectasis and worsen hypoxemia. Hyperventilating to a $P_a\\mathrm{CO_2}$ of $25$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ induces respiratory alkalosis, which shifts the oxyhemoglobin curve to the left, impairing oxygen release to tissues, and may also inhibit HPV.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Temporarily resume two-lung ventilation for $10$–$15$ breaths; verify DLT position; then return to OLV with zero PEEP on the dependent lung and apply CPAP $2$–$5$ $\\mathrm{cmH_2O}$ using a gas mixture with $Fi\\mathrm{O}_2$ $0.3$ to the nondependent lung delivered through the tracheal lumen; administer inhaled nitric oxide into the shared airway to both lungs to improve perfusion matching.**\n\nThis option has an incorrect sequence and flawed interventions. Resuming two-lung ventilation is a rescue maneuver, not a first step. Verifying DLT position should come first. Using zero PEEP is deleterious. Using a low $Fi\\mathrm{O}_2$ of $0.3$ for CPAP is illogical.
