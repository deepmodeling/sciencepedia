The cell is modeled as an ideal osmometer. To solve this, we will employ the principles of osmotic equilibrium and the conservation of intracellular solutes.\n\nThe fundamental principles governing this system are:\n1. The cell membrane is permeable to water but impermeable to the solutes that determine osmolality.\n2. At equilibrium, the osmolality of the intracellular fluid (ICF), $\\Pi_{icf}$, must equal the osmolality of the extracellular fluid (ECF), $\\Pi_{ecf}$. This is a consequence of the equality of water's chemical potential across the membrane.\n3. The total number of moles of impermeant solutes inside the cell, $N_{icf}$, remains constant during the rapid osmotic shift of water.\n\nLet us define the initial and final states of the system. The subscript $i$ will denote the initial state, and the subscript $f$ will denote the final state.\n\nThe given initial conditions are:\n- Initial ECF osmolality, $\\Pi_{ecf, i} = 285 \\text{ mOsm/kg H}_2\\text{O}$.\n- Initial cell volume, $V_{cell, i} = 3000 \\text{ fL}$.\n\nIn the initial state, the cell is in osmotic equilibrium with its surroundings. Therefore, the initial intracellular osmolality is equal to the initial extracellular osmolality:\n$$ \\Pi_{icf, i} = \\Pi_{ecf, i} = 285 \\text{ mOsm/kg H}_2\\text{O} $$\n\nThe total number of impermeant osmoles inside the cell, $N_{icf}$, can be calculated. The problem states that osmolality and osmolarity can be numerically equated for volume calculations, allowing us to write:\n$$ N_{icf} = \\Pi_{icf, i} \\times V_{cell, i} $$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$ N_{icf} = (285 \\text{ mOsm/kg H}_2\\text{O}) \\times (3000 \\text{ fL}) $$\nThis quantity, $N_{icf}$, is conserved.\n\nNext, the ECF osmolality is increased by $\\Delta \\Pi_{ecf} = 10 \\text{ mOsm/kg H}_2\\text{O}$.

The cell volume will change from $V_{cell, i}$ to a new final volume, $V_{cell, f}$. At this new equilibrium, the final intracellular osmolality, $\\Pi_{icf, f}$, must equal the new extracellular osmolality, $\\Pi_{ecf, f}$:\n$$ \\Pi_{icf, f} = \\Pi_{ecf, f} $$\n\nThe final intracellular osmolality is determined by the conserved number of osmoles, $N_{icf}$, and the new cell volume, $V_{cell, f}$:\n$$ \\Pi_{icf, f} = \\frac{N_{icf}}{V_{cell, f}} $$\n\nSince $N_{icf}$ is conserved, we can equate its expression from the initial and final states:\n$$ \\Pi_{icf, i} \\times V_{cell, i} = \\Pi_{icf, f} \\times V_{cell, f} $$\nNow, substituting the equilibrium conditions ($\\Pi_{icf, i} = \\Pi_{ecf, i}$ and $\\Pi_{icf, f} = \\Pi_{ecf, f}$), we arrive at the central relationship, often known as the Boyle-van 't Hoff law for an ideal osmometer:\n$$ \\Pi_{ecf, i} \\times V_{cell, i} = \\Pi_{ecf, f} \\times V_{cell, f} $$\n\nWe can now solve for the final cell volume, $V_{cell, f}$:\n$$ V_{cell, f} = V_{cell, i} \\times \\frac{\\Pi_{ecf, i}}{\\Pi_{ecf, f}} $$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values into this derived relationship:\n$$ V_{cell, f} = 3000 \\text{ fL} \\times \\frac{285 \\text{ mOsm/kg H}_2\\text{O}}{295 \\text{ mOsm/kg H}_2\\text{O}} $$\n$$ V_{cell, f} = 3000 \\times \\frac{285}{295} \\text{ fL} \\approx 2898.30508 \\text{ fL} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the change in cell volume, $\\Delta V_{cell}$, defined as the final volume minus the initial volume:\n$$ \\Delta V_{cell} = V_{cell, f} - V_{cell, i} $$\n$$ \\Delta V_{cell} = (2898.30508... - 3000) \\text{ fL} $$\n$$ \\Delta V_{cell} = -101.69491... \\text{ fL} $$\n\nThe final step is to round the answer to four significant figures.

This exercise examines the profound systemic impact of administering Normal Saline, one of the most common resuscitation fluids. By applying the physicochemical framework of Peter Stewart [@problem_id:5123705], you will uncover the mechanistic link between a high chloride load and the development of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, moving beyond traditional acid-base models to a more powerful and predictive understanding.", "problem": "A hemodynamically unstable surgical patient in the perioperative period receives an intravenous bolus of $2\\,\\mathrm{L}$ of Normal Saline (NS; $0.9\\%$ sodium chloride) as part of resuscitation.

The result, $308$, already has three significant figures, so no further rounding is required.\n\nPart 2: Qualitative explanation of the mechanism of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.\n\nThe mechanistic link between the administration of a large volume of Normal Saline and the development of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is explained by the physicochemical framework of Peter Stewart. This framework identifies three independent variables that determine the hydrogen ion concentration $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$ (and thus pH) in plasma: the Strong Ion Difference ($SID$), the total concentration of weak non-volatile acids ($A_{tot}$), and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide ($\\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$). The problem specifies that $\\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ and $A_{tot}$ are to be considered constant, thus isolating the effect of the change in $SID$. The explanation rests on the fundamental law of electroneutrality.\n\n1.  **The Law of Electroneutrality:** Any macroscopic volume of an aqueous solution, including blood plasma, must be electrically neutral. This means the sum of the molar concentrations of all positive ions (cations) must equal the sum of the molar concentrations of all negative ions (anions).\n    $$ \\sum [\\text{cations}] = \\sum [\\text{anions}] $$\n\n2.  **Strong Ion Difference (SID):** Ions in plasma can be classified as strong or weak. Strong ions are those that are completely, or almost completely, dissociated at physiological pH. Examples include $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. Weak ions are those that are derived from weak acids and bases, which are only partially dissociated. Examples include bicarbonate ($\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$) and albuminates ($\\mathrm{A}^{-}$). The $SID$ is defined as the charge difference between all strong cations and all strong anions.\n    $$ SID = ([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}] + [\\mathrm{K}^{+}] + [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}] + [\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}]) - ([\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}] + [\\text{other strong anions}]) $$\n\n3.  **Relating SID and Electroneutrality:** The law of electroneutrality can be rearranged to show that the $SID$ must be exactly balanced by the net charge of all the weak ions in the solution.\n    $$ [\\text{Strong Cations}] - [\\text{Strong Anions}] = [\\text{Weak Anions}] - [\\text{Weak Cations}] $$\n    In plasma, the principal weak anions are bicarbonate, albuminates, and phosphates, while the only quantitatively significant weak cation is $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The concentration of $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ (in $\\mathrm{nmol/L}$) is orders of magnitude smaller than the other ions (in $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$), so it can be neglected in the charge balance summation. Thus, the relationship simplifies to:\n    $$ SID \\approx [\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}] + [\\mathrm{A}^{-}] + [\\mathrm{Pi}^{-}] $$\n    This equation is a statement of charge balance, not a definition. It means that the electrical charge gap created by the strong ions *must* be filled by an equivalent net negative charge from the weak acid anions.\n\n4.  **Effect of Normal Saline Infusion on SID:** Normal Saline ($0.9\\%\\,\\mathrm{NaCl}$) contains equimolar concentrations of sodium and chloride ions, given as $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}] = 154\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$ and $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}] = 154\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$. Therefore, the strong ion difference of the infused fluid ($SID_{NS}$) is:\n    $$ SID_{NS} = [\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_{NS} - [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{NS} = 154\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L} - 154\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L} $$\n    Normal human plasma, in contrast, has a much higher SID. Typical values are $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}] \\approx 140\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$ and $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}] \\approx 102\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$, yielding a $SID \\approx 140 - 102 = 38\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$.\n    When a large volume ($2\\,\\mathrm{L}$) of a fluid with $SID=0$ is added to the extracellular fluid (which has a positive SID of approximately $38-42\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$), the SID of the resulting mixture is lowered by a dilution-like effect. The chloride concentration increases proportionally more than the sodium concentration (relative to their baseline concentrations), which mathematically forces a decrease in SID.\n\n5.  **The Consequence of a Decreased SID:** According to the Stewart model, $SID$ is an independent variable. A change in $SID$ forces a compensatory change in the dependent variables to maintain electroneutrality. With $A_{tot}$ and $\\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ held constant, the system must adjust the concentrations of the weak anions ($[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]$ and $[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]$) to match the new, lower $SID$.\n    $$ \\downarrow SID = \\downarrow([\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}] + [\\mathrm{A}^{-}] + \\dots) $$\n    The total concentration of weak acids (e.g., $A_{tot} = [\\mathrm{HA}] + [\\mathrm{A}^{-}]$) is assumed to be constant. To decrease the concentration of the dissociated anions ($[\\mathrm{A}^{-}]$), the dissociation equilibrium for weak acids must shift to the left:\n    $$ \\mathrm{H}^{+} + \\mathrm{A}^{-} \\longleftarrow \\mathrm{HA} $$\n    This chemical reaction consumes dissociated anions, but it requires hydrogen ions ($\\mathrm{H}^{+}$).\n\n6.  **The Origin of Hydrogen Ions and Acidosis:** The necessary $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions to drive the association reaction are supplied by the dissociation of water ($\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{O} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H}^{+} + \\mathrm{OH}^{-}$). To satisfy the new charge balance constraint imposed by the lower $SID$, water dissociation increases, raising the free hydrogen ion concentration $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$. The newly available $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ ions combine with weak anions like $\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ and $\\mathrm{A}^{-}$, reducing their concentrations until the sum of their charges equals the new, lower SID. An increase in the concentration of free hydrogen ions, $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$, is the definition of acidosis.\n\nIn summary, the infusion of a large chloride load via Normal Saline (a fluid with $SID=0$) dilutes and lowers the plasma $SID$. To maintain electroneutrality with constant $A_{tot}$ and $\\mathrm{PCO}_{2}$, the concentration of weak anions must decrease. This is achieved by shifting weak acid equilibria towards their associated forms, a process that consumes weak anions but requires an increase in the free hydrogen ion concentration $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$. The resulting elevation in $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$ is termed metabolic acidosis, and because the initiating event is the high chloride load, it is specifically called hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{308}$$", "id": "5123705"}]}
