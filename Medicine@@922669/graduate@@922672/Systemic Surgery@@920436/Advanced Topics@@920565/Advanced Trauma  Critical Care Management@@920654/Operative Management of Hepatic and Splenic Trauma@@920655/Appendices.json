Interventional Radiology ($IR$) and Computed Tomography Angiography ($CTA$) are available.\n- **Objective:** To identify early failure of nonoperative management and mandate timely operative conversion.\n- **Guiding Principles:** The analysis is to be based on the fundamental goals of resuscitation (restoration of tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery) and standard clinical observations for NOM failure (progressive transfusion requirements, hemodynamic instability, failure of metabolic clearance, peritonitis, progressive compartment physiology).\n- **Question:** Identify which of the provided options represent valid early warning criteria mandating immediate operative conversion, as opposed to continued observation or exclusive endovascular therapy.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly rooted in the established principles and evidence-based guidelines of modern trauma surgery. The concepts of NOM, AAST grading, hemodynamic monitoring (including $SI$, $L$, $BD$), transfusion triggers, intra-abdominal hypertension ($IAH$), abdominal compartment syndrome ($ACS$), and the roles of $CTA$ and $IR$ are all standard, scientifically sound components of clinical practice.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for the identification of absolute indications for operative conversion from a set of clinical scenarios, a common and critical decision-making process in trauma care. The provided context (tertiary center, high-grade injuries) is sufficient to allow for a definitive, logical analysis.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem statement is expressed in precise, objective medical terminology. It is free from subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is a valid problem for analysis. Proceeding to solution derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe fundamental principle of nonoperative management (NOM) for solid organ trauma is its application to patients who are hemodynamically stable and without other absolute indications for laparotomy. Failure of NOM occurs when one of these conditions is no longer met. The decision point is not simply a binary choice between NOM and surgery; it is a three-way decision between continued NOM, intervention by Interventional Radiology ($IR$), or operative exploration (laparotomy). Operative conversion is mandated when the patient's condition is not salvageable by or is inappropriate for continued observation or endovascular techniques.\n\nWe will analyze each option against these first principles.\n\n**A. Persistent shock defined by $SI \\ge 1.0$ after $2$ hours of resuscitation with cumulative packed red blood cell transfusion $TRBC \\ge 4$ units and failure of serum lactate to decrease by at least $20\\%$ from baseline, in a patient with AAST grade IV splenic injury.**\n\nThis option describes a patient in refractory hemorrhagic shock.\n- **Hemodynamic Instability:** A shock index ($SI$) persistently $\\ge 1.0$ indicates ongoing shock that is not responding to resuscitation.\n- **Progressive Transfusion Requirements:** A cumulative transfusion of $\\ge 4$ units of packed red blood cells ($PRBCs$) within a short timeframe ($2$ hours) signifies a high rate of blood loss, consistent with uncontrolled hemorrhage.\n- **Failure of Metabolic Clearance:** The inability to clear serum lactate by at least $20\\%$ from baseline is a robust, independent predictor of mortality and NOM failure. It signifies persistent systemic tissue hypoperfusion despite resuscitative efforts.\nCollectively, these three elements depict a patient who is failing resuscitation. The ongoing hemorrhage is too rapid or diffuse to be controlled by the body's compensatory mechanisms or initial fluid/blood administration. Such a patient is often too unstable to be safely transported to and managed in an $IR$ suite, and the bleeding may be from a source not amenable to embolization (e.g., major hilar vascular injury, extensive parenchymal disruption). The standard of care for a trauma patient with ongoing hemorrhagic shock unresponsive to resuscitation is immediate operative intervention to achieve direct surgical hemostasis.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.** This scenario represents a failure of NOM and is an absolute indication for operative conversion.\n\n**B. Isolated contrast blush on CTA in a hemodynamically stable patient with $SI \\le 0.7$, $SBP \\ge 110$ millimeters of mercury (mmHg), no drop in $Hb$, and timely access to IR.**\n\nThis option describes a hemodynamically stable patient with a contained arterial injury.\n- **Hemodynamic Stability:** The patient is explicitly described as stable, with an $SI \\le 0.7$ and $SBP \\ge 110 \\, \\text{mmHg}$, which are markers of adequate perfusion.\n- **CTA Finding:** An \"isolated contrast blush\" on $CTA$ is the classic sign of active arterial extravasation.\n- **Therapeutic Modality:** In a hemodynamically stable patient, this finding is the primary indication for management with angioembolization by $IR$. The success of modern NOM protocols for high-grade solid organ injuries is heavily reliant on the availability and use of $IR$ to control such bleeding sources without the need for a major laparotomy.\nMandating operative conversion in this setting would be contrary to established, evidence-based guidelines. The appropriate next step is $IR$, not surgery.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** This is an indication for endovascular therapy, not operative conversion.\n\n**C. Development of new generalized peritonitis with rebound and involuntary guarding at $6$ hours after injury in a patient under nonoperative management, regardless of hemodynamics.**\n\nThis option describes the development of an acute abdomen, a surgical emergency.\n- **Clinical Signs:** \"Generalized peritonitis with rebound and involuntary guarding\" are unequivocal physical examination signs of significant peritoneal inflammation.\n- **Pathophysiology:** In the context of trauma, the most likely cause of these findings is a missed hollow viscus injury (e.g., perforated bowel), leading to the spillage of enteric contents into the peritoneal cavity. While a large hemoperitoneum can cause mild peritoneal irritation, it does not typically produce generalized guarding and rebound.\n- **Indication for Surgery:** A suspected hollow viscus injury is an absolute indication for exploratory laparotomy. The goal is source control (repair of the perforation) and washout of contamination to prevent lethal sepsis. This indication is independent of the patient's hemodynamic status, as waiting for hemodynamic deterioration would lead to unacceptably high morbidity and mortality.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.** The development of peritonitis mandates operative exploration.\n\n**D. Rising bladder-measured $IAP$ to $28$ mmHg with oliguria and increasing airway pressures in a patient with massive hemoperitoneum during nonoperative management.**\n\nThis option describes the clinical entity of abdominal compartment syndrome ($ACS$).\n- **Definition of ACS:** ACS is defined by the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WSACS) as a sustained intra-abdominal pressure ($IAP$) $ 20 \\, \\text{mmHg}$ that is associated with new-onset organ dysfunction.\n- **Clinical Picture:** The patient's $IAP$ of $28 \\, \\text{mmHg}$ is severely elevated (Grade $IV$ intra-abdominal hypertension). The presence of oliguria (renal dysfunction) and increasing airway pressures (respiratory dysfunction) confirms the diagnosis of ACS. The massive hemoperitoneum is the cause of the elevated pressure.\n- **Treatment:** The definitive and only effective treatment for established ACS is immediate surgical decompression via a decompressive laparotomy. This procedure reduces the $IAP$, restores organ perfusion, and improves ventilation. Delay is fatal. Endovascular therapy has no role in the management of ACS.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.** This is an absolute indication for immediate operative conversion.\n\n**E. Failure of $Hb$ to increase after transfusing $1$ unit of packed red blood cells over $4$ hours in an otherwise stable patient with normal $SBP$ and improving $L$ and $BD$.**\n\nThis option describes a soft sign of potential bleeding in an otherwise improving patient.\n- **Overall Clinical Status:** The patient is described as \"otherwise stable\" with a normal $SBP$ and, critically, \"improving $L$ and $BD$\". This indicates that overall tissue perfusion is being restored and the patient is responding to resuscitation.\n- **Transfusion and $Hb$ Response:** Transfusing a single unit of $PRBCs$ over $4$ hours represents a very low level of transfusion requirement. While the failure of $Hb$ to rise as expected (typically by $\\sim 1 \\, \\text{g/dL}$) can suggest ongoing slow bleeding or hemodilution, it is not a \"hard\" sign mandating surgery, especially in the context of overall stability and metabolic improvement.\n- **Appropriate Management:** This finding warrants increased vigilance, serial $Hb$ monitoring, and potentially a next diagnostic step (e.g., repeat $CTA$). However, it does not meet the criteria for immediate operative conversion. Rushing a stable and improving patient to the operating room based on this single, relatively weak indicator would be overly aggressive and violate the principles of NOM.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** This is an indication for continued observation and/or further non-invasive investigation, not immediate surgery.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "5160236"}, {"introduction": "Once the decision to operate is made for a severe liver injury, controlling hemorrhage is paramount.

Express your final time in minutes.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. All necessary parameters and constraints for a unique solution are provided. The physiological model, while simplified, is based on established principles of oxygen transport and metabolism, and the given values are within realistic physiological ranges. The problem is therefore valid for solution.\n\nThe problem requires determining the maximum safe clamp time, $t_{\\mathrm{clamp,max}}$, for an Intermittent Pringle Maneuver (IPM) cycle. A cycle consists of a clamp phase of duration $t_{\\mathrm{clamp}}$ and a release phase of duration $t_{\\mathrm{rel}}$. The solution must satisfy two safety constraints.\n\nLet's analyze the oxygen dynamics during each phase of the cycle. All quantities are normalized per $100 \\ \\mathrm{g}$ of liver tissue.\n\nFirst, identify the given parameters:\n- Baseline hepatic blood flow: $Q = 100 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, min^{-1} \\, (100 \\, g)^{-1}}$\n- Mixed inflow oxygen content: $C_{\\mathrm{in}} = 0.18 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, O_2 \\, mL^{-1} \\, blood}$\n- Baseline hepatic oxygen consumption: $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = 3.0 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, O_2 \\, min^{-1} \\, (100 \\, g)^{-1}}$\n- Maximum oxygen extraction fraction: $E_{\\max} = 0.70$\n- Critical oxygen debt: $D_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 90 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, O_2 \\, (100 \\, g)^{-1}}$\n- Release time per cycle: $t_{\\mathrm{rel}} = 5.0 \\ \\mathrm{min}$\n\n**1. Clamp Phase (Duration $t_{\\mathrm{clamp}}$)**\nDuring the clamp phase, hepatic inflow is zero. According to physiologic basis (1), oxygen delivery is zero. The liver tissue continues to have a metabolic demand for oxygen, which is unmet. This creates an oxygen debt that accumulates at the rate of baseline oxygen consumption, $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$.\n\nThe total oxygen debt accumulated during the clamp phase, $D_{\\mathrm{acc}}$, is:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{acc}} = \\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2} \\times t_{\\mathrm{clamp}}$$\nThis accumulated debt represents the peak oxygen debt within a cycle, as repayment begins immediately upon release. Let $D_{\\mathrm{peak}} = D_{\\mathrm{acc}}$.\n\n**2. Release Phase (Duration $t_{\\mathrm{rel}}$)**\nDuring the release phase, blood flow is restored. According to physiologic basis (2), the maximal rate of oxygen consumption, $M_{\\max}$, is limited by oxygen delivery and the maximum extraction capability. The rate of oxygen delivery is $Q \\times C_{\\mathrm{in}}$. Therefore, $M_{\\max}$ is:\n$$M_{\\max} = Q \\times C_{\\mathrm{in}} \\times E_{\\max}$$\nThe liver parenchyma still requires its baseline oxygen consumption, $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$, to sustain normal metabolic function. The surplus oxygen consumption capacity, which is the rate at which the accumulated oxygen debt can be repaid, $\\dot{R}_{\\mathrm{repay}}$, is the difference between the maximal possible consumption and the baseline demand:\n$$\\dot{R}_{\\mathrm{repay}} = M_{\\max} - \\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$$\nFor debt repayment to be possible, it is required that $\\dot{R}_{\\mathrm{repay}}  0$, which implies $M_{\\max}  \\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$.\n\nThe total amount of oxygen debt that can be repaid during the release time $t_{\\mathrm{rel}}$ is:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{repaid}} = \\dot{R}_{\\mathrm{repay}} \\times t_{\\mathrm{rel}} = (M_{\\max} - \\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}) \\times t_{\\mathrm{rel}}$$\n\n**3. Applying Safety Constraints**\nWe must find the maximum $t_{\\mathrm{clamp}}$ that satisfies both safety constraints.\n\n**Constraint (i): The intracycle peak oxygen debt must not exceed $D_{\\mathrm{crit}}$.**\nThe peak oxygen debt is $D_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2} \\times t_{\\mathrm{clamp}}$. This constraint requires:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\le D_{\\mathrm{crit}}$$\n$$\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2} \\times t_{\\mathrm{clamp}} \\le D_{\\mathrm{crit}}$$\nThis gives us a first upper bound on $t_{\\mathrm{clamp}}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{clamp}} \\le \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}}$$\n\n**Constraint (ii): There is no net accumulation of oxygen debt over cycles.**\nFor the cycle to be sustainable, the amount of debt repaid during the release phase must be at least equal to the amount of debt accumulated during the clamp phase.\n$$D_{\\mathrm{repaid}} \\ge D_{\\mathrm{acc}}$$\n$$(M_{\\max} - \\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}) \\times t_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\ge \\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2} \\times t_{\\mathrm{clamp}}$$\nThis gives us a second upper bound on $t_{\\mathrm{clamp}}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{clamp}} \\le \\frac{(M_{\\max} - \\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}) \\times t_{\\mathrm{rel}}}{\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}}$$\nThis can also be written as:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{clamp}} \\le \\left( \\frac{M_{\\max}}{\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}} - 1 \\right) \\times t_{\\mathrm{rel}}$$\n\n**4. Calculation of the Maximum Safe Clamp Time ($t_{\\mathrm{clamp,max}}$)**\nThe maximum safe clamp time, $t_{\\mathrm{clamp,max}}$, must satisfy both inequalities. Therefore, it is the minimum of the two derived upper bounds.\n$$t_{\\mathrm{clamp,max}} = \\min \\left( \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}}, \\left( \\frac{M_{\\max}}{\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}} - 1 \\right) \\times t_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values. First, calculate $M_{\\max}$:\n$$M_{\\max} = (100 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, min^{-1} \\, (100 \\, g)^{-1}}) \\times (0.18 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, O_2 \\, mL^{-1}}) \\times 0.70$$\n$$M_{\\max} = 12.6 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, O_2 \\, min^{-1} \\, (100 \\, g)^{-1}}$$\nAs a check, $M_{\\max} = 12.6$ is indeed greater than $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = 3.0$, so debt repayment is possible.\n\nNow, calculate the two bounds for $t_{\\mathrm{clamp}}$.\n\nBound from Constraint (i):\n$$t_{\\mathrm{clamp}} \\le \\frac{90 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, O_2 \\, (100 \\, g)^{-1}}}{3.0 \\ \\mathrm{mL \\, O_2 \\, min^{-1} \\, (100 \\, g)^{-1}}} = 30 \\ \\mathrm{min}$$\n\nBound from Constraint (ii):\n$$t_{\\mathrm{clamp}} \\le \\left( \\frac{12.6}{3.0} - 1 \\right) \\times 5.0 \\ \\mathrm{min}$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{clamp}} \\le (4.2 - 1) \\times 5.0 \\ \\mathrm{min}$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{clamp}} \\le 3.2 \\times 5.0 \\ \\mathrm{min}$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{clamp}} \\le 16.0 \\ \\mathrm{min}$$\n\nThe maximum safe clamp time is the minimum of these two values:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{clamp,max}} = \\min(30.0 \\ \\mathrm{min}, 16.0 \\ \\mathrm{min}) = 16.0 \\ \\mathrm{min}$$\n\nThe limiting factor is the ability to fully repay the oxygen debt within the $5.0$-minute release window, not the absolute critical debt threshold.

This is consistent with **hepatic necrosis**.\n        -   The rising lactate indicates tissue hypoxia and anaerobic metabolism. This confirms significant regional hypoperfusion, likely in the embolized liver and/or spleen, leading to systemic metabolic derangement.\n    -   On POD $5$, the patient develops fever, LUQ pain, and leukocytosis. Applying the given principles:\n        -   Fever and leukocytosis are hallmark signs of the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), likely driven by an infectious process.\n        -   The LUQ pain points to the spleen, which underwent proximal embolization and is at high risk for extensive infarction.\n        -   The combination of infarcted tissue and signs of infection is highly suggestive of a **splenic abscess** (infected necrotic tissue), which is a septic source.\n    -   The overall picture is one of evolving complications: hepatic necrosis causing metabolic distress, followed by a splenic abscess causing a septic state.\n\n2.  **Formulation of a Management Strategy**:\n    -   **Monitoring**: A robust monitoring strategy is required.\n        -   To track perfusion and systemic stress (Principle 1), serial lactate measurements are crucial as long as abnormalities persist.\n        -   To track cardiac output ($CO$), a component of $DO_2$, frequent vital sign monitoring is necessary.\n        -   To track organ injury/dysfunction, daily liver function tests and bilirubin are needed for the liver, and WBC counts for infection.\n        -   Upon development of fever, a sign of sepsis (Principle 3), blood cultures are mandatory to identify a pathogen.\n    -   **Diagnosis**: The clinical suspicion of hepatic necrosis and splenic abscess requires confirmation and characterization.\n        -   Principle 4 identifies CT with IV contrast as the superior imaging modality for this purpose, as it can delineate perfusion defects, areas of necrosis, and fluid collections (abscesses). Imaging should be triggered by the clinical changes (pain, fever, leukocytosis, rising lactate).\n    -   **Intervention**: Management must address both the systemic effects and the local sources.\n        -   **Sepsis Management**: The patient meets criteria for SIRS with a suspected source. Principle 3 mandates prompt intervention with **antimicrobial therapy** and **source control**. Empiric antibiotics should cover common pathogens from the gut (Gram-negatives, anaerobes) that might seed necrotic tissue.\n        -   **Splenic Abscess (Source Control)**: Principle 3 requires drainage or debridement. A stepwise approach is logical: attempt less invasive percutaneous drainage if the abscess is amenable (solitary, accessible). If this fails, is not possible (multiloculated), or the patient deteriorates, surgical removal (**splenectomy**) is necessary for definitive source control. Following splenectomy, Principle 5 requires **vaccination** against encapsulated organisms.\n        -   **Hepatic Necrosis Management**: The primary injury is ischemic. The therapeutic goal is to support the remaining liver and prevent further damage. Principle 1 ($DO_2 = CO \\times CaO_2$) guides therapy toward optimizing systemic oxygen delivery via measures like IV fluid resuscitation and pain control to support cardiac output. The embolization was for bleeding; re-embolizing would only extend the necrosis and is contraindicated. Complications of necrosis, like infected collections (abscesses) or bile leaks (bilomas), would themselves require source control, typically via drainage. Surgical debridement is a last resort for refractory sepsis.\n\nThis derived strategy provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the given options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Minimize laboratory testing to avoid iatrogenic anemia; defer imaging unless the patient becomes hypotensive; treat fever with antipyretics only; avoid antibiotics to prevent antimicrobial resistance.**\nThis approach is dangerously passive. Minimizing labs ignores critical data on organ dysfunction (lactate, LFTs). Deferring imaging until hypotension (a late sign of septic shock) violates the principle of early source control. Treating fever with only antipyretics masks a serious infection. Withholding antibiotics in a patient with clear signs of sepsis with a source is a direct violation of sepsis management principles.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Focus monitoring on serial hemoglobin and vital signs; perform CT only in case of hemodynamic collapse; manage suspected splenic abscess with antibiotics alone; for suspected hepatic necrosis, perform repeat embolization of the hepatic artery to ensure definitive cessation of arterial inflow.**\nThis option contains multiple critical errors. Monitoring is insufficient as it omits lactate and LFTs. Waiting for hemodynamic collapse for a CT is too late. Managing a frank abscess with antibiotics alone violates the principle of source control, which requires drainage or debridement. The suggestion to perform repeat embolization for hepatic necrosis is a profound misunderstanding of pathophysiology; necrosis is caused by ischemia, and further embolization would only worsen it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Implement structured monitoring with quarter-hourly vital signs in the immediate post-embolization period transitioning to every 6 to 8 hours by postoperative day $1$, serial serum lactate every 6 to 12 hours for the first $48$ hours, daily liver function tests and bilirubin, and early blood cultures if fever occurs; obtain CT with intravenous contrast within 24 to 48 hours if persistent right upper quadrant or left upper quadrant pain, fever, or rising lactate persists; initiate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting enteric Gram-negative organisms and anaerobes when abscess or infected necrosis is suspected; for splenic abscess, perform percutaneous drainage if the collection is solitary, unilocular, and larger than 3 cm with a safe access window, and proceed to splenectomy in cases of multiloculated abscess, failure of percutaneous drainage, or clinical deterioration, followed by vaccination against encapsulated organisms; for hepatic necrosis, optimize oxygen delivery using fluid resuscitation and pain control to support cardiac output and oxygenation, drain bilomas or infected collections, and surgically debride clearly demarcated necrotic segments if sepsis or bile leak persists despite drainage and antibiotics, reserving repeat embolization for documented recurrent bleeding rather than for necrosis.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with the strategy derived from first principles.\n-   **Monitoring**: Comprehensive, timely, and targeted (vitals, lactate, LFTs, cultures).\n-   **Diagnosis**: Correctly uses clinical triggers for the appropriate imaging modality (CT with contrast).\n-   **Sepsis Treatment**: Correctly advocates for early, broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n-   **Splenic Abscess**: Correctly outlines the standard, stepwise approach to source control (drainage then splenectomy) and follows up with vaccination.\n-   **Hepatic Necrosis**: Correctly prioritizes supportive care ($DO_2$ optimization), drainage of collections, reserves surgery for refractory cases, and correctly identifies that repeat embolization is only for recurrent bleeding, not necrosis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Schedule routine MRI of the abdomen at $12$ hours post-embolization for surveillance; perform prophylactic splenectomy to prevent abscess formation; for hepatic necrosis, refer immediately for liver transplantation evaluation regardless of clinical stability and absence of liver failure.**\nThis approach is illogical and overly aggressive. Principle 4 states MRI is not for routine emergent use; CT is preferred. Prophylactic splenectomy negates the purpose of non-operative management and is not indicated for all patients. Immediate referral for liver transplantation is an extreme measure reserved for fulminant liver failure, which this patient does not have.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Use Doppler ultrasound only for surveillance and avoid contrast imaging to reduce nephrotoxicity risk; treat post-embolization pain with corticosteroids to decrease inflammation; avoid antibiotics unless hypotension develops; do not vaccinate after splenectomy due to low absolute risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection.**\nThis option is replete with harmful suggestions. Principle 4 notes US is less sensitive than CT. The benefit of CT contrast in this septic patient far outweighs the risk of nephrotoxicity. Corticosteroids would suppress the immune system, worsening the infection. Withholding antibiotics until hypotension is an egregious error. Not vaccinating after splenectomy directly contradicts Principle 5 and is a violation of the standard of care.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "5160165"}]}
