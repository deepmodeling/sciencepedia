The Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) provides a fundamental, non-invasive metric by comparing the systolic blood pressure at the ankle to that in the arm.

Examination reveals a small entry wound without active hemorrhage, intact motor function, and diminished dorsalis pedis Doppler signal compared to the contralateral limb. Supine Doppler systolic pressures are obtained as follows: right dorsalis pedis (injured side) $80$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, left brachial $118$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, and right brachial $120$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$. In vascular trauma screening, the Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) is a dimensionless ratio defined clinically from noninvasive blood pressure measurements to quantify distal perfusion relative to proximal inflow. In contemporary extremity vascular trauma algorithms, a reduced ABI can indicate the need for further imaging such as Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA).

The decision to perform a limb-saving fasciotomy must be based on objective data, not just clinical suspicion.

After initial resuscitation, the measured diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is $60$ millimeters of mercury (mmHg), and needle-manometer assessment of the most tense compartment yields a compartment pressure of $35$ mmHg. Using only fundamental hemodynamic principles, construct the quantitative perfusion differential across the microvascular wall that determines whether urgent decompressive fasciotomy is indicated. The physical basis to use is the transmural pressure concept: at any vessel cross-section, flow is supported when the intraluminal driving pressure exceeds the surrounding extraluminal tissue pressure, and microvascular driving pressure during diastole is bounded above by the arterial diastolic pressure. A widely accepted, well-tested clinical criterion for critical impairment of microvascular perfusion is a perfusion differential at or below $30$ mmHg, under which urgent fasciotomy is indicated.\n\nCompute the perfusion differential in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) for the given patient.

On examination at $4$ hours after injury, his foot is warm with capillary refill of approximately $3$ seconds, motor function and light touch are intact, and the compartments are compressible.

This diagnosis is established by a combination of findings:\n    *   **Mechanism**: Posterior knee dislocation is a classic cause of popliteal artery stretch injury and occlusion.\n    *   **Physical Exam**: Absent palpable pulses and a monophasic Doppler signal are hard signs of severe arterial compromise. The \"warm\" foot is due to collateral circulation, which is insufficient for long-term limb viability.\n    *   **Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)**: The calculated ABI is approximately $80/130 \\approx 0.62$. A value less than $0.90$ confirms hemodynamically significant ischemia.\n    *   **CTA**: The imaging definitively confirms a short-segment occlusion of the popliteal artery.\n\n2.  **Urgency**: The patient is experiencing acute limb ischemia. Skeletal muscle can only tolerate this condition for about 4-6 hours before irreversible necrosis begins. The patient is already 4 hours post-injury. Therefore, emergent intervention is required to restore blood flow.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A. Observation with serial neurovascular checks and repeat Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) in $24$ hours**: This is incorrect. Observation is inappropriate for a confirmed, hemodynamically significant arterial occlusion. Delaying intervention would risk irreversible muscle death and limb loss.\n\n*   **B. Initiate systemic therapeutic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin and observe**: This is incorrect. While heparin is used to prevent further clot formation, it does not resolve the existing mechanical occlusion. It is an adjunct to, not a replacement for, definitive repair.\n\n*   **C. Urgent operative repair to restore inline arterial flow to the distal extremity**: This is the **correct** answer. The standard of care for traumatic popliteal artery occlusion with acute limb ischemia is immediate surgical revascularization. This typically involves an open repair with a vein graft to restore durable, pulsatile flow and salvage the limb.\n\n*   **D. Immediate four-compartment fasciotomy alone without arterial intervention**: This is incorrect. The compartments are not yet tense. More importantly, performing a fasciotomy without restoring arterial inflow is futile; the limb will remain ischemic and the muscle will die regardless of compartment pressure.\n\n*   **E. Endovascular stent-graft placement across the popliteal segment as definitive therapy**: This is not the most appropriate option. While endovascular techniques exist, placing a stent-graft across a major joint like the knee in a young, active patient carries a high risk of long-term failure due to stent fracture and kinking. Open surgical repair with a vein graft is the more durable and preferred solution in this scenario.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "5122076"}]}
