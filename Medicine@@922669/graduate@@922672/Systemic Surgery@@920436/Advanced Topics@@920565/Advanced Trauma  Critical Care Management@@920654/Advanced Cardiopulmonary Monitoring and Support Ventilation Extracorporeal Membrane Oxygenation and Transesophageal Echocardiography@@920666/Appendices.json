The solution requires first justifying the given dependency of $P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2}$ on $\\dot{V}_{sweep}$ and the metabolic CO$_2$ production, $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{CO}_2}$.\n\n**Justification of the Dependency**\n\nAt a steady state in a patient with negligible native gas exchange, the rate of metabolic carbon dioxide production ($\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{CO}_2}$) must be equal to the rate of carbon dioxide removal by the ECMO oxygenator.\nLet's denote the rate of CO$_2$ removal by the oxygenator as $\\dot{V}_{E,\\mathrm{CO}_2}$. By conservation of mass:\n$$ \\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{CO}_2} = \\dot{V}_{E,\\mathrm{CO}_2} $$\nThe rate of CO$_2$ removed by the sweep gas is the product of the total sweep gas flow rate, $\\dot{V}_{sweep}$, and the fractional concentration of CO$_2$ in the exiting sweep gas, $F_{E\\mathrm{CO}_2}$. The entering sweep gas has zero CO$_2$.\n$$ \\dot{V}_{E,\\mathrm{CO}_2} = \\dot{V}_{sweep} \\times F_{E\\mathrm{CO}_2} $$\nAccording to the ideal gas law and Dalton's law of partial pressures, the fractional concentration of CO$_2$ is the ratio of its partial pressure in the exiting gas, $P_{E\\mathrm{CO}_2}$, to the total barometric pressure, $P_{atm}$.\n$$ F_{E\\mathrm{CO}_2} = \\frac{P_{E\\mathrm{CO}_2}}{P_{atm}} $$\nCombining these equations, we get:\n$$ \\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{CO}_2} = \\dot{V}_{sweep} \\frac{P_{E\\mathrm{CO}_2}}{P_{atm}} $$\nSolving for the partial pressure of CO$_2$ in the exiting gas:\n$$ P_{E\\mathrm{CO}_2} = P_{atm} \\frac{\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{CO}_2}}{\\dot{V}_{sweep}} $$\nThe problem states that the gas and blood phases are in near-equilibrium, which implies that $P_{E\\mathrm{CO}_2}$ is proportional to the partial pressure of CO$_2$ in the blood leaving the oxygenator. The problem further simplifies the complex physiological mixing dynamics by directly stating that the systemic arterial $P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2}$ is proportional to the ratio of metabolic CO$_2$ production to the sweep gas flow rate. Since $P_{atm}$ and $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{CO}_2}$ are given as constant, our derived relationship for $P_{E\\mathrm{CO}_2}$ already shows that $P_{E\\mathrm{CO}_2} \\propto \\frac{\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{CO}_2}}{\\dot{V}_{sweep}}$. The problem's premise, $P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2} \\propto \\frac{\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{CO}_2}}{\\dot{V}_{sweep}}$, is thus physically justified under the given assumptions.\n\nThis proportionality can be written with a constant of proportionality, $k$:\n$$ P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2} = k \\frac{\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{CO}_2}}{\\dot{V}_{sweep}} $$\n\n**Calculation of the New $P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2}$**\n\nLet the initial state be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final state by subscript $2$.\nFor the initial state:\n- $P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2, 1} = 68~\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- $\\dot{V}_{sweep, 1} = 2~\\mathrm{L/min}$\n\nFor the final state:\n- $P_{a\\mathrm{CO}_2, 2}$ is the unknown to be calculated.\n- $\\dot{V}_{sweep, 2} = 6~\\mathrm{L/min}$\n\nThe metabolic CO$_2$ production $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{CO}_2}$ is stable, and the proportionality factor $k$ is a constant of the system.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle of oxygen transport in blood is that oxygen is carried in two distinct forms: chemically bound to hemoglobin within red blood cells and physically dissolved in the aqueous phase of blood (plasma). The total arterial oxygen content, $C_{aO_2}$, is the sum of the concentrations of oxygen in these two compartments.\n\nLet's derive the expression for each component.\n\n1.  **Oxygen Bound to Hemoglobin**:\n    The amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin depends on three factors: the concentration of hemoglobin ($Hb$), the oxygen-carrying capacity of each gram of hemoglobin, and the percentage of hemoglobin that is actually saturated with oxygen ($S_{aO_2}$).\n\n    The problem states that each gram of fully saturated hemoglobin can bind $k_{Hb} = 1.34$ milliliters of oxygen ($O_2$).\n    The hemoglobin concentration is given as $Hb$.\n    Therefore, the maximum amount of oxygen that the blood can carry bound to hemoglobin, known as the oxygen-carrying capacity, is the product of the hemoglobin concentration and its specific binding capacity:\n    $$ \\text{Maximum } O_2 \\text{-carrying capacity} = Hb \\times k_{Hb} $$\n    The units for this quantity would be (grams/deciliter) $\\times$ (milliliters/gram) = milliliters/deciliter.\n\n    However, not all hemoglobin is saturated with oxygen. The arterial oxygen saturation, $S_{aO_2}$, represents the fraction of hemoglobin's available binding sites that are occupied by oxygen. Thus, the actual amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin is:\n    $$ [O_2]_{\\text{bound}} = Hb \\times k_{Hb} \\times S_{aO_2} $$\n\n2.  **Oxygen Dissolved in Plasma**:\n    According to Henry's law, the concentration of a gas dissolved in a liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas in equilibrium with the liquid. The constant of proportionality is the solubility coefficient of the gas in that liquid at a given temperature.\n\n    The problem provides the solubility of oxygen in plasma at body temperature as $\\alpha = 0.003$ milliliters of $O_2$ per deciliter of blood per millimeter of mercury (mmHg) of partial pressure.\n    The arterial partial pressure of oxygen is given as $P_{aO_2}$.\n    Therefore, the amount of oxygen dissolved in the plasma is:\n    $$ [O_2]_{\\text{dissolved}} = \\alpha \\times P_{aO_2} $$\n    The units for this quantity are (mL/(dL $\\cdot$ mmHg)) $\\times$ (mmHg) = mL/dL.\n\n3.  **Total Arterial Oxygen Content ($C_{aO_2}$)**:\n    The total arterial oxygen content is the sum of the bound and dissolved components. Combining the expressions derived above, we obtain the general formula:\n    $$ C_{aO_2} = (Hb \\times k_{Hb} \\times S_{aO_2}) + (\\alpha \\times P_{aO_2}) $$\n    This is the general expression derived from first principles as requested.\n\nNow, we will compute the numerical value of $C_{aO_2}$ using the provided data:\n- Hemoglobin concentration, $Hb = 8 \\, \\text{g/dL}$\n- Arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation, $S_{aO_2} = 0.90$\n- Arterial partial pressure of oxygen, $P_{aO_2} = 60 \\, \\text{mmHg}$\n- Oxygen-binding capacity of hemoglobin, $k_{Hb} = 1.34 \\, \\text{mL } O_2/\\text{g } Hb$\n- Solubility of oxygen in plasma, $\\alpha = 0.003 \\, \\text{mL } O_2/(\\text{dL} \\cdot \\text{mmHg})$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$ C_{aO_2} = (8 \\times 1.34 \\times 0.90) + (0.003 \\times 60) $$\n\nFirst, calculate the contribution from oxygen bound to hemoglobin:\n$$ [O_2]_{\\text{bound}} = 8 \\, \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{dL}} \\times 1.34 \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{g}} \\times 0.90 $$\n$$ [O_2]_{\\text{bound}} = 10.72 \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{dL}} \\times 0.90 $$\n$$ [O_2]_{\\text{bound}} = 9.648 \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{dL}} $$\n\nNext, calculate the contribution from dissolved oxygen:\n$$ [O_2]_{\\text{dissolved}} = 0.003 \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{dL} \\cdot \\text{mmHg}} \\times 60 \\, \\text{mmHg} $$\n$$ [O_2]_{\\text{dissolved}} = 0.18 \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{dL}} $$\n\nFinally, sum the two components to find the total arterial oxygen content:\n$$ C_{aO_2} = 9.648 \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{dL}} + 0.18 \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{dL}} $$\n$$ C_{aO_2} = 9.828 \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{dL}} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The problem does not contain any other listed flaws.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will proceed by deriving the answer from the provided principles and then evaluating each option.\n\n## Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe problem requires an explanation of the limitations of standard two-wavelength pulse oximetry in the setting of carbon monoxide poisoning and the justification for using multi-wavelength co-oximetry. The analysis must be based on the provided Beer-Lambert law and saturation definitions.\n\n**Fundamental Principles**\n\n1.  **Beer-Lambert Law**: $A(\\lambda) = \\sum_{i} \\epsilon_i(\\lambda)\\,c_i\\,l$. Absorbance at a given wavelength is the sum of the absorbances of all light-absorbing species (chromophores) present. Each species' contribution is proportional to its molar extinction coefficient $\\epsilon_i(\\lambda)$ and its concentration $c_i$.\n\n2.  **Pulse Oximetry**: This technique measures the differential absorbance of light at two wavelengths (typically red, $\\lambda_R \\approx 660$ $\\mathrm{nm}$, and infrared, $\\lambda_{IR} \\approx 940$ $\\mathrm{nm}$) between the pulsatile (arterial) and non-pulsatile (tissue, venous blood) compartments. It is designed to solve for the relative concentrations of two species: oxyhemoglobin ($[\\mathrm{HbO_2}]$) and deoxyhemoglobin ($[\\mathrm{HHb}]$).\n    The device calculates a ratio of the normalized pulsatile absorbances at the two wavelengths:\n    $$R = \\frac{A_{\\text{pulsatile}}(\\lambda_R)}{A_{\\text{pulsatile}}(\\lambda_{IR})}$$\n    This ratio $R$ is then mapped to an oxygen saturation value, $S_{pO_2}$, using an empirically derived calibration curve. The underlying mathematical model assumes that only $[\\mathrm{HbO_2}]$ and $[\\mathrm{HHb}]$ are present:\n    $$A(\\lambda) \\approx (\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HbO_2}}(\\lambda)[\\mathrm{HbO_2}] + \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HHb}}(\\lambda)[\\mathrm{HHb}]) \\cdot l$$\n    The problem arises when a third species, such as carboxyhemoglobin ($[\\mathrm{COHb}]$), is present in significant concentration. The two-wavelength system is now underdetermined and cannot solve for three unknown concentrations. Instead, it misinterprets the absorbance contribution from $[\\mathrm{COHb}]$ as arising from $[\\mathrm{HbO_2}]$ and/or $[\\mathrm{HHb}]$.\n\n3.  **Spectrophotometric Properties**: The key to the misinterpretation lies in the extinction coefficients of the different hemoglobin species at the two wavelengths used.\n    -   At $\\lambda_R \\approx 660$ $\\mathrm{nm}$ (red light), $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HHb}}$ is high, while $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HbO_2}}$ is low. Critically, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{COHb}}$ at this wavelength is very similar to $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HbO_2}}$.\n    -   At $\\lambda_{IR} \\approx 940$ $\\mathrm{nm}$ (infrared light), $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HbO_2}}$ is higher than $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HHb}}$. The extinction coefficient for $[\\mathrm{COHb}]$, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{COHb}}$, is very low at this wavelength.\n    Because $[\\mathrm{COHb}]$ absorbs red light much like $[\\mathrm{HbO_2}]$ but absorbs very little infrared light, the pulse oximeter's algorithm predominantly interprets the signal from $[\\mathrm{COHb}]$ as if it were $[\\mathrm{HbO_2}]$. This leads to a falsely high calculated saturation.\n\n4.  **Co-oximetry**: This laboratory method overcomes the limitation by using multiple wavelengths (typically $\\ge 4$). By measuring absorbance at several points across the spectrum where $[\\mathrm{HbO_2}]$, $[\\mathrm{HHb}]$, $[\\mathrm{COHb}]$, and $[\\mathrm{MetHb}]$ have distinct and known extinction coefficients, it can set up a system of simultaneous linear equations based on the Beer-Lambert law:\n    $$A(\\lambda_1) = l \\cdot (\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HbO_2}}(\\lambda_1)[\\mathrm{HbO_2}] + \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HHb}}(\\lambda_1)[\\mathrm{HHb}] + \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{COHb}}(\\lambda_1)[\\mathrm{COHb}] + \\dots)$$\n    $$A(\\lambda_2) = l \\cdot (\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HbO_2}}(\\lambda_2)[\\mathrm{HbO_2}] + \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HHb}}(\\lambda_2)[\\mathrm{HHb}] + \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{COHb}}(\\lambda_2)[\\mathrm{COHb}] + \\dots)$$\n    $$...$$\n    Solving this system yields the individual concentrations of all relevant hemoglobin species. From these, the fractional saturation, $S_{aO_2}$, can be calculated accurately.\n\n5.  **Clinical Picture**: In the given scenario, the high $P_{aO_2}$ of $300$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ is a direct result of breathing $100\\%$ oxygen ($F_{IO_2} = 1.0$) and reflects a large amount of oxygen *dissolved* in the plasma. However, it gives no information about the oxygen *bound* to hemoglobin. The $S_{pO_2}$ of $99\\%$ is falsely reassuring because the pulse oximeter is \"fooled\" by the $[\\mathrm{COHb}]$. The true oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is severely diminished, a fact that would be revealed by a co-oximeter measuring a low fractional saturation ($S_{aO_2}$). This disparity between a high $S_{pO_2}$ and the patient's actual (hypoxic) state is the hallmark of CO poisoning.\n\n---\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Two-wavelength pulse oximetry assumes only two significant chromophores and uses the ratio of pulsatile absorbance at $\\lambda \\approx 660$ $\\mathrm{nm}$ and $\\lambda \\approx 940$ $\\mathrm{nm}$ to estimate $S_{pO_2}$; because $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{COHb}}(660\\ \\mathrm{nm}) \\approx \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HbO_2}}(660\\ \\mathrm{nm})$, $[\\mathrm{COHb}]$ is misclassified as $[\\mathrm{HbO_2}]$, leading to overestimation of $S_{pO_2}$. Co-oximetry acquires $\\ge 4$ wavelengths and solves the Beer–Lambert system to estimate $[\\mathrm{HbO_2}]$, $[\\mathrm{HHb}]$, $[\\mathrm{COHb}]$, and $[\\mathrm{MetHb}]$, thereby reporting $S_{aO_2}$.**\nThis statement accurately describes the core physical principles. It correctly identifies the two-chromophore assumption of pulse oximetry, the wavelengths used, and the fundamental reason for the error in the presence of $[\\mathrm{COHb}]$—the similarity of the extinction coefficients $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{COHb}}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HbO_2}}$ at the red wavelength. It correctly contrasts this with the multi-wavelength approach of co-oximetry, which allows for solving the system of equations for multiple species to find the true fractional saturation, $S_{aO_2}$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Pulse oximetry is inherently immune to dyshemoglobins because the pulsatile method isolates arterial blood; the ratio-of-ratios robustly estimates $[\\mathrm{COHb}]$ and $[\\mathrm{MetHb}]$ without additional wavelengths.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The pulsatile method isolates the arterial blood signal, but the subsequent two-wavelength analysis is precisely what is vulnerable to interference from dyshemoglobins like $[\\mathrm{COHb}]$ and $[\\mathrm{MetHb}]$. A two-wavelength system is mathematically incapable of resolving more than two species. Therefore, it cannot \"robustly estimate\" $[\\mathrm{COHb}]$ and $[\\mathrm{MetHb}]$; it is confounded by them.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. End-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring combined with pulse oximetry is sufficient to detect carbon monoxide poisoning because carbon monoxide reliably causes an increase in $\\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{Q}$ mismatch that lowers $S_{pO_2}$.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. First, end-tidal carbon dioxide ($E_t\\mathrm{CO_2}$) primarily reflects alveolar ventilation and pulmonary perfusion, not CO poisoning directly. Second, the primary pathophysiologic effect of CO is competitive binding to hemoglobin, reducing oxygen-carrying capacity, not causing a primary $\\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{Q}$ mismatch. Third, and most critically, CO poisoning does *not* lower the $S_{pO_2}$ reading; it causes a spurious *elevation* of the $S_{pO_2}$ reading, masking the underlying hypoxia.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. A high $P_{aO_2}$ on an arterial blood gas excludes significant $[\\mathrm{COHb}]$, so the discrepancy between $P_{aO_2}$ and $S_{pO_2}$ is not informative; co-oximetry adds no diagnostic value.**\nThis statement is fundamentally wrong. Arterial partial pressure of oxygen, $P_{aO_2}$, measures the amount of oxygen physically dissolved in blood plasma and is completely independent of the status of hemoglobin binding sites. A patient can have lethal levels of $[\\mathrm{COHb}]$ while having a high $P_{aO_2}$, especially when receiving supplemental oxygen. The discrepancy between the expected near-total saturation at a high $P_{aO_2}$ and the patient's clinical state of hypoxia (which is masked by the falsely high $S_{pO_2}$) is a key diagnostic clue. Co-oximetry is the definitive diagnostic test and is of paramount value.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Pulse oximetry reports functional saturation $S_{pO_2} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{HbO_2}]}{[\\mathrm{HbO_2}] + [\\mathrm{HHb}]}$ and therefore ignores $[\\mathrm{COHb}]$ and $[\\mathrm{MetHb}]$ in its denominator, whereas co-oximetry reports fractional saturation $S_{aO_2} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{HbO_2}]}{[\\mathrm{HbO_2}] + [\\mathrm{HHb}] + [\\mathrm{COHb}] + [\\mathrm{MetHb}]}$ by resolving species with multiple wavelengths; in suspected carbon monoxide poisoning, this distinction is clinically decisive.**\nThis statement accurately presents the definitional difference between the quantity a pulse oximeter is designed to measure (functional saturation) and the quantity measured by a co-oximeter (fractional saturation). By its definition, functional saturation only considers hemoglobin capable of binding oxygen ($[\\mathrm{HbO_2}]$ and $[\\mathrm{HHb}]$) and does not account for dysfunctional species like $[\\mathrm{COHb}]$. Fractional saturation, reported by co-oximetry, accounts for all hemoglobin species and thus represents the true fraction of oxygenated hemoglobin. This distinction is the crux of the clinical problem in CO poisoning, where functional saturation can be high while fractional saturation is dangerously low.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "5082389"}]}
