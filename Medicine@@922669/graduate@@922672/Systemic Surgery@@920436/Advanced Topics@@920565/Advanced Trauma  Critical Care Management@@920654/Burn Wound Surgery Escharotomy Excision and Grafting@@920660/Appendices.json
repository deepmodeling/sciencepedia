Preoperative systemic management requires accurate crystalloid fluid resuscitation over the initial $24$ hours to mitigate burn shock and maintain end-organ perfusion.

The principles described—that fluid requirements scale with patient mass and the extent of the burn—are the foundation of standard resuscitation formulas, most notably the Parkland (or Baxter) formula, which is a cornerstone of ABLS guidelines. The problem is a formalization of established medical principles. It is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for a derivation followed by a calculation. The steps are logically sequential. The problem requires identifying \"the ABLS adult constant of proportionality,\" which refers to the well-known constant in the Parkland formula. In a specialized context like this, expecting the solver to know or look up such a fundamental, named constant is standard practice and does not render the problem incomplete. The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, technical language, free of subjective or biased content.\n4.  **Consistency and Completeness**: The relationships and data provided are internally consistent. The variable $\\beta$ is defined as the burn size in \"the clinically used unit,\" which is unambiguously the TBSA expressed as a percentage. The relationship between the fraction $\\alpha$ and the percentage $\\beta$ is straightforward ($\\beta=100\\alpha$), allowing for the derivation. The data provided ($m=70\\,\\text{kg}$, $\\beta=40$) are realistic.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem that asks for the application of scaling principles and a standard clinical formula to a realistic scenario. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested: derivation of the scaling expression, determination of the constant, and calculation of the infusion rate.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Scaling Expression**\n\nThe problem states that the total resuscitation volume, $V$, scales with both the body mass, $m$, and the fraction of TBSA burned, $\\alpha$. This can be expressed as two separate proportionalities:\n$$V \\propto m$$\n$$V \\propto \\alpha$$\nCombining these into a single joint proportionality gives:\n$$V \\propto m \\alpha$$\nThis proportionality can be converted into an equation by introducing a constant of proportionality, which we will call $k$:\n$$V(m, \\alpha) = k \\, m \\, \\alpha$$\nHere, $\\alpha$ is the dimensionless fraction of TBSA, where $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$. Clinically, burn size is reported as a percentage. Let $\\beta$ be the burn size expressed in this clinical unit (percent TBSA). The relationship between the fraction $\\alpha$ and the percentage value $\\beta$ is:\n$$\\beta = 100 \\alpha \\quad \\implies \\quad \\alpha = \\frac{\\beta}{100}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\alpha$ into the volume equation:\n$$V(m, \\beta) = k \\, m \\left( \\frac{\\beta}{100} \\right)$$\nWe can regroup the constants by defining a new constant $c = \\frac{k}{100}$. The equation then takes the form:\n$$V(m, \\beta) = c \\, m \\, \\beta$$\nThis completes the derivation, showing that the volume scales linearly with mass $m$ and the clinically reported burn size percentage $\\beta$, with a new constant of proportionality $c$.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Constant $c$**\n\nThe problem requires adopting the ABLS adult constant of proportionality. The standard formula for adult burn resuscitation under ABLS guidance is the Parkland formula, which calculates the total volume of Lactated Ringer's (a crystalloid solution) to be administered over $24$ hours. The formula is:\n$$V_{\\text{total}} \\, (\\text{in mL}) = 4 \\, (\\text{mL} \\cdot \\text{kg}^{-1} \\cdot \\%^{-1}) \\times \\text{Mass} \\, (\\text{in kg}) \\times \\text{TBSA} \\, (\\%)$$\nUsing our notation, where $m$ is mass in $\\text{kg}$ and $\\beta$ is the TBSA percentage value, this is:\n$$V(m, \\beta) = 4 \\, m \\, \\beta$$\nBy comparing this standard clinical formula to our derived expression $V(m, \\beta) = c \\, m \\, \\beta$, we can directly identify the constant $c$:\n$$c = 4$$\nThe units of $c$ are determined by the units of the other quantities in the equation $V = c m \\beta$. With $V$ in $\\text{mL}$, $m$ in $\\text{kg}$, and $\\beta$ being the numerical value of the percentage (dimensionless in calculation, but its \"unit\" is percent TBSA), the units of $c$ are $\\text{mL} / (\\text{kg} \\cdot \\% \\text{TBSA})$. This matches the problem's requested unit specification of \"$\\text{mL}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}$ per unit of clinically reported burn size.\"\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Infusion Rate**\n\nWe are asked to compute the infusion rate for the first $8$ hours for a patient with $m = 70\\,\\text{kg}$ and a burn size of $\\beta = 40$ (representing a $40\\%$ TBSA burn).\n\nFirst, we calculate the total volume required over $24$ hours using the formula $V = 4 \\, m \\, \\beta$:\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = 4 \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\%} \\times 70 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 40 \\, \\%$$\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = 4 \\times 70 \\times 40 \\, \\text{mL} = 11200 \\, \\text{mL}$$\nAccording to the clinical rule provided, half of this total volume is to be administered in the first $8$ hours. Let this volume be $V_8$:\n$$V_8 = \\frac{1}{2} V_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 11200 \\, \\text{mL} = 5600 \\, \\text{mL}$$\nThe infusion rate, $R_8$, is this volume divided by the time duration of $8$ hours:\n$$R_8 = \\frac{V_8}{8 \\, \\text{h}} = \\frac{5600 \\, \\text{mL}}{8 \\, \\text{h}}$$\n$$R_8 = 700 \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{h}}$$\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $700$. This number, when expressed to three significant figures, is $7.00 \\times 10^2$, which is numerically equal to $700$.

It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective problem that can be solved using the provided information and fundamental principles of physiology and physics. Proceeding with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\n**1. Derive an expression for Perfusion Pressure (PP).**\n\nThe problem states that volumetric blood flow, $Q$, through the vascular bed is proportional to the pressure gradient, $\\Delta P$, across it. This relationship is a form of Ohm's law for fluids:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R}$$\nwhere $R$ is the vascular resistance, assumed to be constant. For flow to occur ($Q > 0$), there must be a positive pressure gradient ($\\Delta P > 0$). This gradient, $\\Delta P$, is the effective Perfusion Pressure (PP) that drives blood through the tissue.\n\nThe pressure gradient $\\Delta P$ is the difference between the pressure at the inflow point of the vascular bed, $P_{\\text{in}}$, and the pressure at the outflow point, $P_{\\text{out}}$.\n$$\\text{PP} = \\Delta P = P_{\\text{in}} - P_{\\text{out}}$$\n\nAccording to the problem's explicit assumptions:\n- The arterial inflow pressure, $P_{\\text{in}}$, is approximated by the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP).\n$$P_{\\text{in}} \\approx \\text{MAP}$$\n- The venous outflow pressure, $P_{\\text{out}}$, is determined by the external pressure exerted by the swollen tissue within the fascial compartment. Veins are low-pressure, collapsible vessels. When the external compartment pressure, $P_{\\text{comp}}$, exceeds the normal low pressure within the veins, the veins collapse. For blood to flow out of the compartment, the pressure inside the veins must rise to at least match the external pressure to keep the vessels patent. Therefore, the effective outflow pressure that the arterial inflow must overcome is the compartment pressure itself.\n$$P_{\\text{out}} \\approx P_{\\text{comp}}$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions for $P_{\\text{in}}$ and $P_{\\text{out}}$ into the equation for Perfusion Pressure, we obtain the desired expression:\n$$\\text{PP} = \\text{MAP} - P_{\\text{comp}}$$\n\n**2. Compute the numerical value of the Perfusion Pressure.**\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- $\\text{MAP} = 70\\,\\text{mmHg}$\n- $P_{\\text{comp}} = 35\\,\\text{mmHg}$\n\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$\\text{PP} = 70\\,\\text{mmHg} - 35\\,\\text{mmHg} = 35\\,\\text{mmHg}$$\n\n**3. Evaluate the adequacy of limb perfusion.**\n\nThe calculated Perfusion Pressure is $\\text{PP} = 35\\,\\text{mmHg}$. The problem states that the critical minimum perfusion gradient required for skeletal muscle survival is $30\\,\\text{mmHg}$.\n\nWe compare the calculated value to this critical threshold:\n$$35\\,\\text{mmHg} > 30\\,\\text{mmHg}$$\n\nBased on this static measurement, the calculated Perfusion Pressure is currently above the minimum threshold for tissue viability. However, the clinical context of \"progressive\" symptoms indicates a dynamic and deteriorating situation where the compartment pressure is likely still rising. A value so close to the critical threshold, in conjunction with neurological symptoms, signals impending irreversible ischemic injury and is a strong indication for emergent surgical decompression (escharotomy and/or fasciotomy).
