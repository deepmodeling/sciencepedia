As part of perioperative planning, you must select an appropriately sized endotracheal tube for airway management based on age-dependent airway scaling. The pediatric subglottic airway (at the cricoid ring) is the functionally narrowest segment, and for the age range $4$ to $12$ years, the recommended endotracheal tube internal diameter for an uncuffed tube is known to vary approximately linearly with age, based on widely accepted clinical observations. Specifically, two empirically validated points for uncuffed tube internal diameter (measured in millimeters) are: at age $4$ years, $5.0$ millimeters; at age $12$ years, $7.0$ millimeters. Treating the uncuffed internal diameter as a linear function of age, derive the linear relationship $ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(a)$, where $a$ is age in years. Then, incorporate the empirically observed adjustment that for a cuffed endotracheal tube, the internal diameter should be decreased by approximately $0.5$ millimeters compared to the uncuffed recommendation at the same age, yielding $ID_{\\text{cuffed}}(a)$.

It is scientifically grounded in established pediatric perioperative principles, specifically the standard empirical formulas used for endotracheal tube sizing. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information (two data points for a linear model) to derive a unique solution, and it is expressed in objective, formalizable language.\n\nThe task is to determine the appropriate internal diameters for uncuffed and cuffed endotracheal tubes for a child of age $6$ years. The problem states that the uncuffed tube internal diameter, denoted as $ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}$, varies linearly with age, $a$. We can express this relationship as a linear function:\n$$ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(a) = m \\cdot a + b$$\nwhere $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the y-intercept. The variables are age $a$ in years and internal diameter $ID$ in millimeters.\n\nWe are given two data points from empirical observations:\n1. At age $a_1 = 4$ years, the internal diameter is $ID_1 = 5.0$ mm. This gives the point $(4, 5.0)$.\n2. At age $a_2 = 12$ years, the internal diameter is $ID_2 = 7.0$ mm. This gives the point $(12, 7.0)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the slope, $m$, of the linear function:\n$$m = \\frac{\\Delta ID}{\\Delta a} = \\frac{ID_2 - ID_1}{a_2 - a_1} = \\frac{7.0 - 5.0}{12 - 4} = \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nSo, the slope is $m = 0.25$.\n\nNext, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation, $ID - ID_1 = m(a - a_1)$, to find the full equation. Substituting the first point $(4, 5.0)$ and the slope $m = \\frac{1}{4}$:\n$$ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(a) - 5.0 = \\frac{1}{4}(a - 4)$$\n$$ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(a) = \\frac{1}{4}a - \\frac{1}{4}(4) + 5.0$$\n$$ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(a) = \\frac{1}{4}a - 1 + 5.0$$\n$$ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(a) = \\frac{1}{4}a + 4$$\nThis is the derived linear relationship for the uncuffed endotracheal tube internal diameter. This formula is consistent with the widely used Cole's formula for pediatric patients older than $2$ years.\n\nNow, we apply this formula to find the recommended uncuffed tube size for a child aged $a = 6$ years:\n$$ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(6) = \\frac{1}{4}(6) + 4 = \\frac{6}{4} + 4 = 1.5 + 4 = 5.5$$\nThe recommended internal diameter for an uncuffed tube is $5.5$ mm.\n\nNext, we address the cuffed endotracheal tube. The problem states that for a cuffed tube, the internal diameter should be decreased by $0.5$ millimeters compared to the uncuffed recommendation. Thus, the function for the cuffed tube internal diameter, $ID_{\\text{cuffed}}(a)$, is:\n$$ID_{\\text{cuffed}}(a) = ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(a) - 0.5$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(a)$:\n$$ID_{\\text{cuffed}}(a) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}a + 4\\right) - 0.5 = \\frac{1}{4}a + 3.5$$\nThis is consistent with the standard formula for cuffed tubes.\n\nWe now calculate the recommended cuffed tube size for a child aged $a = 6$ years:\n$$ID_{\\text{cuffed}}(6) = \\frac{1}{4}(6) + 3.5 = 1.5 + 3.5 = 5.0$$\nAlternatively, we can directly use the result for the uncuffed tube at age $6$:\n$$ID_{\\text{cuffed}}(6) = ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(6) - 0.5 = 5.5 - 0.5 = 5.0$$\nThe recommended internal diameter for a cuffed tube is $5.0$ mm.\n\nThe final answer requires both the uncuffed and cuffed internal diameters for a $6$-year-old child.
