This quantity represents the probability that the patient has Hirschsprung's disease after a positive test result is observed. The derivation will be rigorously based on Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability, utilizing the provided definitions.\n\nThe given quantities are:\n-   The pretest probability (or prior probability) of aganglionosis: $P(A) = P$.\n-   The sensitivity of the AChE stain: $S = P(T^{+} \\mid A)$. This is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has aganglionosis.\n-   The specificity of the AChE stain: $C = P(T^{-} \\mid \\overline{A})$. This is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have aganglionosis.\n\nOur objective is to find $P(A \\mid T^{+})$.\n\nAccording to the definition of conditional probability, which forms the basis of Bayes' theorem, we have:\n$$P(A \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(A \\cap T^{+})}{P(T^{+})}$$\n\nThe term in the numerator, $P(A \\cap T^{+})$, is the joint probability of having aganglionosis and receiving a positive test result. This can be re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability, $P(X \\mid Y) = \\frac{P(X \\cap Y)}{P(Y)}$, which implies $P(X \\cap Y) = P(X \\mid Y)P(Y)$. Applying this, we get:\n$$P(A \\cap T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\mid A) P(A)$$\nSubstituting the given symbols, the numerator becomes:\n$$P(A \\cap T^{+}) = S \\cdot P$$\n\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T^{+})$, is the overall probability of a positive test result. To calculate this, we use the law of total probability. The events $A$ (aganglionosis present) and $\\overline{A}$ (aganglionosis absent) form a partition of the sample space. Therefore, the probability of $T^{+}$ can be expressed as the sum of its probabilities conditioned on these two mutually exclusive and exhaustive events:\n$$P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\mid A)P(A) + P(T^{+} \\mid \\overline{A})P(\\overline{A})$$\n\nWe need to express each term in this sum using the given variables $S$, $C$, and $P$.\n1.  $P(T^{+} \\mid A)$ is the sensitivity, $S$.\n2.  $P(A)$ is the pretest probability, $P$.\n3.  $P(\\overline{A})$ is the probability of the complement of $A$. By the axiom of probability, $P(\\overline{A}) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - P$.\n4.  $P(T^{+} \\mid \\overline{A})$ is the probability of a positive test in a patient without aganglionosis (the false positive rate). We are given the specificity, $C = P(T^{-} \\mid \\overline{A})$. Since for a given condition (here, $\\overline{A}$), the test result must be either positive ($T^{+}$) or negative ($T^{-}$), the sum of their probabilities is $1$:\n    $$P(T^{+} \\mid \\overline{A}) + P(T^{-} \\mid \\overline{A}) = 1$$\n    Solving for $P(T^{+} \\mid \\overline{A})$, we get:\n    $$P(T^{+} \\mid \\overline{A}) = 1 - P(T^{-} \\mid \\overline{A}) = 1 - C$$\n\nNow, we substitute these components back into the expression for the total probability $P(T^{+})$:\n$$P(T^{+}) = (S)(P) + (1 - C)(1 - P)$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for the numerator ($S \\cdot P$) and the denominator ($S \\cdot P + (1 - C)(1 - P)$) back into the main Bayes' theorem formula for $P(A \\mid T^{+})$:\n$$P(A \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{S P}{S P + (1 - C)(1 - P)}$$\n\nThis equation is the derived closed-form analytic expression for the posterior probability $P(A \\mid T^{+})$ in terms of $S$, $C$, and $P$. It is also known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of the diagnostic test.

Provide this criterion as an analytic expression only; do not compute a numerical value for $s_{\\max}$. Briefly discuss, in words, how changes in $p$, $r$, and $t$ influence the mechanical demand on the anastomosis and the implications for suture spacing.", "solution": "### Solution Derivation\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of Hoop Stress ($\\sigma_h$)**\n\nWe model the anastomotic ring as a thin-walled cylinder of radius $r$, wall thickness $t$, and subjected to a uniform internal gauge pressure $p$. To find the circumferential stress, also known as hoop stress ($\\sigma_h$), we perform a force balance on a section of the cylinder.\n\nConsider a longitudinal segment of the cylinder of arbitrary length $L$. We make a conceptual cut along the diameter of this segment, splitting it into two halves. Let us analyze the static equilibrium of one of these half-cylinders.\n\nThe internal pressure $p$ acts perpendicularly on the internal surface. The \"bursting\" force, $F_p$, resulting from this pressure tends to push the two halves apart. This force is equal to the pressure $p$ multiplied by the projected area onto which the pressure acts. The projected area is a rectangle of width $2r$ (the diameter) and length $L$.\n$$\nF_p = p \\times (2r \\times L)\n$$\nThis bursting force must be balanced by the resisting force, $F_{\\sigma}$, generated by the hoop stress $\\sigma_h$ acting within the material of the cylinder wall. This stress acts over the cross-sectional area of the wall that has been cut. The cut exposes two rectangular cross-sections, each with an area of $t \\times L$. The total resisting area is therefore $2 \\times (t \\times L)$. The total resisting force is the product of the hoop stress and this total area.\n$$\nF_{\\sigma} = \\sigma_h \\times (2 \\times t \\times L)\n$$\nFor the half-cylinder to be in static equilibrium, the bursting force must be equal to the resisting force:\n$$\n\\sum F = 0 \\implies F_p = F_{\\sigma}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the forces:\n$$\np(2rL) = \\sigma_h(2tL)\n$$\nWe can solve for the hoop stress, $\\sigma_h$, by dividing both sides by $2tL$. The length $L$ and the factor of $2$ cancel out, yielding the standard formula for hoop stress in a thin-walled cylinder:\n$$\n\\sigma_h = \\frac{pr}{t}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation of the expression.\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of $\\sigma_h$ using the provided parameters: $p = 6.4\\,\\text{kPa}$, $r = 6.0\\,\\text{mm}$, and $t = 1.5\\,\\text{mm}$.\n$$\n\\sigma_h = \\frac{(6.4\\,\\text{kPa})(6.0\\,\\text{mm})}{1.5\\,\\text{mm}}\n$$\nThe units of millimeters ($\\text{mm}$) in the numerator and denominator cancel, leaving the result in kilopascals ($\\text{kPa}$), as required.\n$$\n\\sigma_h = \\frac{38.4}{1.5}\\,\\text{kPa} = 25.6\\,\\text{kPa}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\sigma_h = 25.60\\,\\text{kPa}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Suture Spacing Criterion**\n\nWe need to relate the maximum allowable suture spacing, $s_{\\max}$, to the suture's allowable tensile capacity, $F_{\\text{allow}}$, the pressure $p$, and the radius $r$.\n\nThe assumption is that the total circumferential load is carried by the interrupted sutures. Consider a circumferential segment of the anastomosis of length $s_{\\max}$. A single suture is responsible for bearing the hoop load generated over this length.\n\nThe total circumferential tensile force, $F_{\\text{hoop}}$, acting within the wall over a length $s_{\\max}$ can be found by considering the bursting force on that segment. This is the same logic as in Part 1, but with length $L$ replaced by $s_{\\max}$. The bursting force over this segment is $p \\times (2r) \\times s_{\\max}$. This force is resisted by the tension in the wall on both sides of the conceptual cut. The force on one side of the cut, which must be carried by a single suture at that location, is half of the total bursting force.\n$$\nF_{\\text{suture}} = \\frac{1}{2} F_{p, \\text{segment}} = \\frac{1}{2} [p(2r)s_{\\max}] = prs_{\\max}\n$$\nThis is the tensile force that a single suture must withstand. For the anastomosis to remain intact, this force must not exceed the allowable tensile capacity of the suture, $F_{\\text{allow}}$. The limiting condition for the maximum spacing, $s_{\\max}$, occurs when this force is exactly equal to the allowable capacity:\n$$\nF_{\\text{suture}} = F_{\\text{allow}}\n$$\n$$\nprs_{\\max} = F_{\\text{allow}}\n$$\nSolving for $s_{\\max}$ gives the desired criterion:\n$$\ns_{\\max} = \\frac{F_{\\text{allow}}}{pr}\n$$\nThis symbolic expression relates the maximum safe distance between sutures to the material properties of the suture and the mechanical loading conditions on the anastomosis.\n\n**Part 3: Discussion of Parameter Influences**\n\nThe mechanical demand on the anastomosis is quantified by the circumferential (hoop) stress, $\\sigma_h$. The derived formula is $\\sigma_h = pr/t$.\n- An increase in intraluminal pressure ($p$) or luminal radius ($r$) leads to a proportional increase in $\\sigma_h$, thus increasing the mechanical demand on the tissue.\n- An increase in wall thickness ($t$) leads to a decrease in $\\sigma_h$, as the same load is distributed over a larger cross-sectional area. A thinner, more delicate, or edematous wall is therefore under greater stress for a given pressure and radius.\n\nThe implications for suture spacing are evident from the criterion $s_{\\max} = F_{\\text{allow}}/(pr)$.\n- The maximum safe spacing between sutures, $s_{\\max}$, is inversely proportional to both pressure ($p$) and radius ($r$). An increase in either of these parameters means the sutures must be placed closer together (smaller $s_{\\max}$) to ensure that the load on any individual suture does not exceed its capacity, $F_{\\text{allow}}$. A dilated segment of bowel ($r$ is large) or a condition leading to high intraluminal pressures ($p$ is high), such as postoperative ileus or excessive crying, necessitates a more densely sutured anastomosis to prevent dehiscence.\n- Notably, the wall thickness $t$ does not appear in the final expression for $s_{\\max}$. This is because the hoop force per unit length of the anastomosis, $pr$, is independent of wall thickness in this model. While a thinner wall experiences higher *stress* ($\\sigma_h$), the total *force* that must be restrained by the sutures over a given length depends only on the pressure and radius.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 25.60 & \\frac{F_{\\text{allow}}}{pr} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "5131705"}]}
