These assumptions are common and acceptable for this level of analysis.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary parameters ($r_1, L_1, r_2, L_2$) and constraints ($\\Delta P_{1} = \\Delta P_{2}$, $\\mu_{1} = \\mu_{2}$) to determine a unique, stable, and meaningful solution for the required ratio $\\frac{Q_{1}}{Q_{2}}$.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. The given values for graft dimensions are physiologically realistic.\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem does not suffer from any other listed flaws such as being unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the dependence of volumetric flow on geometric and rheological parameters for steady, incompressible, laminar flow through a straight, rigid, cylindrical pipe. This physical situation is described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. This equation establishes a relationship between the volumetric flow rate $Q$, the pressure drop along the pipe $\\Delta P$, the dynamic viscosity of the fluid $\\mu$, the radius of the pipe $r$, and the length of the pipe $L$.\n\nThe Hagen-Poiseuille equation is:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^{4} \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$$\nThis equation is the fundamental relationship describing the dependence of volumetric flow on the system's parameters.\n\nWe are asked to compare the flow capacities of two different conduits: the radial artery (RA), denoted by subscript $1$, and the saphenous vein graft (SVG), denoted by subscript $2$.\n\nFor the radial artery (conduit $1$), the volumetric flow rate $Q_{1}$ is:\n$$Q_{1} = \\frac{\\pi r_{1}^{4} \\Delta P_{1}}{8 \\mu_{1} L_{1}}$$\n\nFor the saphenous vein graft (conduit $2$), the volumetric flow rate $Q_{2}$ is:\n$$Q_{2} = \\frac{\\pi r_{2}^{4} \\Delta P_{2}}{8 \\mu_{2} L_{2}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the volumetric flow capacity of the RA to that of the SVG, which is $\\frac{Q_{1}}{Q_{2}}$. We can write this ratio as:\n$$\\frac{Q_{1}}{Q_{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi r_{1}^{4} \\Delta P_{1}}{8 \\mu_{1} L_{1}}}{\\frac{\\pi r_{2}^{4} \\Delta P_{2}}{8 \\mu_{2} L_{2}}}$$\n\nThe problem states that the mean pressure drop is the same for both conduits ($\\Delta P_{1} = \\Delta P_{2}$) and the blood viscosity is the same ($\\mu_{1} = \\mu_{2}$). The constants $\\pi$ and $8$ are also common to both expressions. Therefore, these terms cancel out in the ratio:\n$$\\frac{Q_{1}}{Q_{2}} = \\frac{r_{1}^{4} / L_{1}}{r_{2}^{4} / L_{2}}$$\n\nRearranging this expression gives:\n$$\\frac{Q_{1}}{Q_{2}} = \\left(\\frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}}\\right)^{4} \\left(\\frac{L_{2}}{L_{1}}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this symbolic expression.\nGiven:\n$r_{1} = 1.2 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n$r_{2} = 1.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n$L_{1} = 0.18 \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$L_{2} = 0.22 \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nThe units for the radii ratio and the length ratio will cancel, resulting in a dimensionless quantity, as expected.\n$$\\frac{Q_{1}}{Q_{2}} = \\left(\\frac{1.2}{1.8}\\right)^{4} \\left(\\frac{0.22}{0.18}\\right)$$\n\nWe simplify the fractions:\n$\\frac{1.2}{1.8} = \\frac{12}{18} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n$\\frac{0.22}{0.18} = \\frac{22}{18} = \\frac{11}{9}$\n\nSubstituting these simplified fractions back into the equation for the ratio:\n$$\\frac{Q_{1}}{Q_{2}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{4} \\left(\\frac{11}{9}\\right) = \\frac{2^{4}}{3^{4}} \\times \\frac{11}{9} = \\frac{16}{81} \\times \\frac{11}{9} = \\frac{176}{729}$$\n\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division:\n$$\\frac{176}{729} \\approx 0.2414266118...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\nThe first three significant figures are $2$, $4$, and $1$. The fourth significant figure is $4$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\nThe final numerical ratio is $0.241$.\n\nAs requested for interpretation, this result shows that the theoretical flow capacity of the radial artery is approximately $24.1\\%$ of that of the saphenous vein graft under these idealized conditions. The Hagen-Poiseuille equation reveals that the volumetric flow rate is proportional to the fourth power of the radius ($Q \\propto r^{4}$) and inversely proportional to the length ($Q \\propto L^{-1}$). The RA's smaller radius ($1.2 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ vs $1.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ for the SVG) is the dominant factor. The term $(\\frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}})^{4} = (\\frac{2}{3})^{4} \\approx 0.1975$ dramatically reduces the RA's flow capacity. Although the RA is shorter, which tends to increase flow, this effect is much weaker and is overwhelmingly counteracted by the profound influence of the smaller radius. For a sequential graft supplying multiple distal branches, a high total flow capacity is critical. The significantly larger flow capacity of the SVG, primarily due to its larger radius, makes it a superior conduit for this specific application based solely on these fluid dynamic principles.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.241}\n$$", "id": "5105018"}, {"introduction": "A theoretically sound graft choice is only useful if the graft functions correctly after implantation.

A rigorous derivation of the solution can proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe three required parameters—mean flow $(\\bar{Q})$, pulsatility index $(PI)$, and diastolic fraction $(DF)$—are calculated based on their fundamental definitions.\n\n**1. Mean Flow ($\\bar{Q}$)**\n\nThe mean flow over one cardiac cycle is the total volume of blood that flows during the cycle $(V_{\\text{cycle}})$ divided by the duration of the cycle $(T)$. The total volume is the sum of the volume during systole $(V_s)$ and the volume during diastole $(V_d)$.\n\nThe volume flowed during a phase is the product of the phase-averaged flow rate and the duration of that phase.\n$$V_s = \\bar{Q_s} \\cdot T_s$$\n$$V_d = \\bar{Q_d} \\cdot T_d$$\n\nThe mean flow $\\bar{Q}$ is the time-weighted average of the phase-averaged flows:\n$$\\bar{Q} = \\frac{V_{\\text{cycle}}}{T} = \\frac{V_s + V_d}{T} = \\frac{\\bar{Q_s} T_s + \\bar{Q_d} T_d}{T_s + T_d}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values (flow in $\\text{mL/min}$, time in $\\text{s}$):\n$$\\bar{Q} = \\frac{(10\\,\\text{mL/min}) \\cdot (0.28\\,\\text{s}) + (40\\,\\text{mL/min}) \\cdot (0.52\\,\\text{s})}{0.28\\,\\text{s} + 0.52\\,\\text{s}}$$\n$$\\bar{Q} = \\frac{2.8 + 20.8}{0.80} \\, \\frac{\\text{mL} \\cdot \\text{s}}{\\text{min} \\cdot \\text{s}} = \\frac{23.6}{0.80} \\, \\text{mL/min}$$\n$$\\bar{Q} = 29.5\\,\\text{mL/min}$$\n\n**2. Pulsatility Index ($PI$)**\n\nThe pulsatility index is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum instantaneous flows, normalized by the mean flow.\n$$PI = \\frac{Q_{\\max} - Q_{\\min}}{\\bar{Q}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values and the calculated mean flow:\n$$Q_{\\max} = 65\\,\\text{mL/min}$$\n$$Q_{\\min} = -5\\,\\text{mL/min}$$\n$$\\bar{Q} = 29.5\\,\\text{mL/min}$$\n$$PI = \\frac{65\\,\\text{mL/min} - (-5\\,\\text{mL/min})}{29.5\\,\\text{mL/min}} = \\frac{70}{29.5}$$\n$$PI \\approx 2.37288...$$\nRounding to two decimal places, $PI = 2.37$. This is a dimensionless quantity.\n\n**3. Diastolic Fraction ($DF$)**\n\nThe diastolic fraction is the ratio of the volume of blood delivered during diastole $(V_d)$ to the total volume delivered during the entire cycle $(V_{\\text{cycle}})$. The phase-averaged flows $\\bar{Q_s}$ and $\\bar{Q_d}$ are positive, and thus represent forward flow.\n$$DF = \\frac{V_d}{V_{\\text{cycle}}} = \\frac{V_d}{V_s + V_d} = \\frac{\\bar{Q_d} T_d}{\\bar{Q_s} T_s + \\bar{Q_d} T_d}$$\n\nSubstituting the previously calculated products $\\bar{Q} \\cdot T$:\n$$DF = \\frac{20.8}{2.8 + 20.8} = \\frac{20.8}{23.6}$$\n$$DF \\approx 0.88135...$$\nExpressed as a percentage and rounded, $DF = 88\\%$.\n\n**4. Assessment Against Thresholds**\n\nThe calculated values are compared to the acceptability thresholds:\n-   **Mean Flow**: $\\bar{Q} = 29.5\\,\\text{mL/min}$. This is greater than the threshold of $20\\,\\text{mL/min}$. The graft meets this criterion.\n-   **Pulsatility Index**: $PI = 2.37$. This is less than the threshold of $5$. The graft meets this criterion.\n-   **Diastolic Fraction**: $DF = 88\\%$. This is greater than the threshold of $50\\%$. The graft meets this criterion.\n\nConclusion: All three parameters meet the commonly accepted intraoperative thresholds for a LIMA-LAD graft.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A.

For a given graft $g$ on a target $i$, the expected gain, $E_{g,i}$, is the product of the graft's patency probability, $P(g, i)$, and the perfusion gain if patent, $G_i$.\n$$E_{g,i} = P(g, i) \\times G_i$$\nThe perfusion gain if patent, $G_i$, is a function of the myocardial territory weight $w_i$, the ischemic perfusion deficit $(1 - \\mathrm{FFR}_i)$, a target quality factor $t_i$, a competitive flow effectiveness factor $m_i$, and a possible overlap modifier.\n$$G_i = w_i \\times (1 - \\mathrm{FFR}_i) \\times t_i \\times m_i \\times (\\text{overlap modifier})$$\nThe overlap modifier is applied to the calculation of $G_i$ for specific targets if their corresponding paired target is also grafted.\n\nFirst, we calculate the intermediate factors $t_i$ and $m_i$ and the base patent perfusion gain, $G_{\\text{base}}(i) = w_i \\times (1 - \\mathrm{FFR}_i) \\times t_i \\times m_i$, for each of the $6$ targets.\n\nThe target quality factor $t_i$ is determined by the diameter stenosis $d_i$:\n- LAD: $d_{\\mathrm{LAD}} = 0.85 \\geq 0.80 \\implies t_{\\mathrm{LAD}} = 1.00$\n- D1: $d_{\\mathrm{D1}} = 0.70$, so $0.70 \\leq d_{\\mathrm{D1}}  0.80 \\implies t_{\\mathrm{D1}} = 0.90$\n- OM1: $d_{\\mathrm{OM1}} = 0.80 \\geq 0.80 \\implies t_{\\mathrm{OM1}} = 1.00$\n- OM2: $d_{\\mathrm{OM2}} = 0.60$, so $0.60 \\leq d_{\\mathrm{OM2}}  0.70 \\implies t_{\\mathrm{OM2}} = 0.80$\n- PDA: $d_{\\mathrm{PDA}} = 0.75$, so $0.70 \\leq d_{\\mathrm{PDA}}  0.80 \\implies t_{\\mathrm{PDA}} = 0.90$\n- PLB: $d_{\\mathrm{PLB}} = 0.55  0.60 \\implies t_{\\mathrm{PLB}} = 0.70$\n\nThe competitive flow effectiveness factor $m_i$ is determined by the FFR:\n- LAD: $\\mathrm{FFR}_{\\mathrm{LAD}} = 0.68 \\leq 0.85 \\implies m_{\\mathrm{LAD}} = 1.00$\n- D1: $\\mathrm{FFR}_{\\mathrm{D1}} = 0.82 \\leq 0.85 \\implies m_{\\mathrm{D1}} = 1.00$\n- OM1: $\\mathrm{FFR}_{\\mathrm{OM1}} = 0.76 \\leq 0.85 \\implies m_{\\mathrm{OM1}} = 1.00$\n- OM2: $\\mathrm{FFR}_{\\mathrm{OM2}} = 0.88  0.85 \\implies m_{\\mathrm{OM2}} = 0.70$\n- PDA: $\\mathrm{FFR}_{\\mathrm{PDA}} = 0.73 \\leq 0.85 \\implies m_{\\mathrm{PDA}} = 1.00$\n- PLB: $\\mathrm{FFR}_{\\mathrm{PLB}} = 0.92  0.85 \\implies m_{\\mathrm{PLB}} = 0.70$\n\nNow, we calculate $G_{\\text{base}}(i)$ for each target:\n- $G_{\\text{base}}(\\mathrm{LAD}) = 0.35 \\times (1 - 0.68) \\times 1.00 \\times 1.00 = 0.1120$\n- $G_{\\text{base}}(\\mathrm{D1}) = 0.10 \\times (1 - 0.82) \\times 0.90 \\times 1.00 = 0.0162$\n- $G_{\\text{base}}(\\mathrm{OM1}) = 0.15 \\times (1 - 0.76) \\times 1.00 \\times 1.00 = 0.0360$\n- $G_{\\text{base}}(\\mathrm{OM2}) = 0.10 \\times (1 - 0.88) \\times 0.80 \\times 0.70 = 0.00672$\n- $G_{\\text{base}}(\\mathrm{PDA}) = 0.20 \\times (1 - 0.73) \\times 0.90 \\times 1.00 = 0.0486$\n- $G_{\\text{base}}(\\mathrm{PLB}) = 0.10 \\times (1 - 0.92) \\times 0.70 \\times 0.70 = 0.00392$\n\nNext, we find the patency probabilities $P(g, i)$ for each graft on each target, based on the FFR categories:\n- FFR $\\leq 0.80$ (LAD, OM1, PDA): $P(\\text{LITA})=0.95$, $P(\\text{RA})=0.85$, $P(\\text{SVG})=0.75$.\n- $0.80 $ FFR $\\leq 0.90$ (D1, OM2): $P(\\text{LITA})=0.85$, $P(\\text{RA})=0.75$, $P(\\text{SVG})=0.60$.\n- FFR $ 0.90$ (PLB): $P(\\text{LITA})=0.70$, $P(\\text{RA})=0.60$, $P(\\text{SVG})=0.40$.\n\nUsing these, we can calculate the base expected gain, $E_{\\text{base}}(g, i) = P(g, i) \\times G_{\\text{base}}(i)$, for all $18$ possible pairs. This is the expected gain before considering overlap penalties.\n\n| Target | $E_{\\text{base}}(\\text{LITA}, i)$ | $E_{\\text{base}}(\\text{RA}, i)$ | $E_{\\text{base}}(\\text{SVG}, i)$ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| LAD | $0.95 \\times 0.1120 = 0.106400$ | $0.85 \\times 0.1120 = 0.095200$ | $0.75 \\times 0.1120 = 0.084000$ |\n| D1 | $0.85 \\times 0.0162 = 0.013770$ | $0.75 \\times 0.0162 = 0.012150$ | $0.60 \\times 0.0162 = 0.009720$ |\n| OM1 | $0.95 \\times 0.0360 = 0.034200$ | $0.85 \\times 0.0360 = 0.030600$ | $0.75 \\times 0.0360 = 0.027000$ |\n| OM2 | $0.85 \\times 0.00672 = 0.005712$ | $0.75 \\times 0.00672 = 0.005040$ | $0.60 \\times 0.00672 = 0.004032$ |\n| PDA | $0.95 \\times 0.0486 = 0.046170$ | $0.85 \\times 0.0486 = 0.041310$ | $0.75 \\times 0.0486 = 0.036450$ |\n| PLB | $0.70 \\times 0.00392 = 0.002744$ | $0.60 \\times 0.00392 = 0.002352$ | $0.40 \\times 0.00392 = 0.001568$ |\n\nThe problem is to select $3$ targets and assign the $3$ grafts to maximize the total expected gain. Based on the $E_{\\text{base}}$ values, the three most valuable targets are LAD, PDA, and OM1. Let's analyze the choice of this set of targets: {LAD, PDA, OM1}. An important feature of this set is that it contains no pairs that trigger an overlap penalty (LAD-D1, OM1-OM2, PDA-PLB). Therefore, the total expected gain for this set is the sum of the $E_{\\text{base}}$ values for an optimal assignment of grafts.\n\nWe must solve the assignment problem for targets {LAD, PDA, OM1} and grafts {LITA, RA, SVG}. The matrix of values is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\text{LITA}  \\text{RA}  \\text{SVG} \\\\\n\\text{LAD}  0.106400  0.095200  0.084000 \\\\\n\\text{PDA}  0.046170  0.041310  0.036450 \\\\\n\\text{OM1}  0.034200  0.030600  0.027000 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo maximize the sum, we should assign the best-performing graft, LITA, to the target where it provides the greatest benefit, which is LAD ($E_{\\text{base}}(\\text{LITA}, \\text{LAD}) = 0.106400$). Now we are left to assign RA and SVG to PDA and OM1.\nThe two possibilities are:\n1. RA $\\to$ PDA and SVG $\\to$ OM1: Gain from these two is $0.041310 + 0.027000 = 0.068310$.\n2. RA $\\to$ OM1 and SVG $\\to$ PDA: Gain from these two is $0.030600 + 0.036450 = 0.067050$.\n\nThe first option is superior. Thus, the optimal assignment for this set of targets is:\n- LITA $\\to$ LAD\n- RA $\\to$ PDA\n- SVG $\\to$ OM1\n\nThe maximum expected gain for this set is $E_{\\text{total}} = 0.106400 + 0.041310 + 0.027000 = 0.174710$.\n\nAny other set of three targets would involve either replacing one of {LAD, PDA, OM1} with a target that has a lower $E_{\\text{base}}$ value (e.g., swapping OM1 for D1) or incurring an overlap penalty. For instance, if we consider the set {LAD, PDA, D1}, we replace OM1 with the lower-value D1, and we must also apply the overlap penalty to D1's contribution (multiplying its gain by $0.70$) because LAD is also grafted. This will inevitably result in a lower total expected gain. For any chosen assignment, the contribution from the {graft, D1} pair will be smaller than the corresponding contribution from the {graft, OM1} pair in the original set, and the contributions from LAD and PDA remain the same or possibly decrease if the assignment changes. For instance, the maximum gain for {LAD, PDA, D1} is with LITA$\\to$LAD, RA$\\to$PDA, SVG$\\to$D1, yielding $0.106400 + 0.041310 + (0.009720 \\times 0.70) = 0.154514$, which is less than $0.174710$. This logic holds for all other possible combinations of targets.\n\nTherefore, the maximum expected myocardial perfusion gain is achieved by grafting LAD, PDA, and OM1 with LITA, RA, and SVG, respectively. The maximum gain is $0.174710$.\n\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\n$$0.174710 \\approx 0.1747$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1747}$$", "id": "5105054"}]}
