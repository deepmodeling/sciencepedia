The context and parameters provided are consistent with established clinical practices in cardiovascular surgery for thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Therefore, I will proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe core task is to select an endograft from a given set of nominal diameters that best fits a specified oversizing requirement for an aorta of a known diameter.\n\nFirst, let us define the variables and parameters provided in the problem statement.\nThe diameter of the native ascending aorta at the intended proximal landing zone is given as $D_{\\text{native}} = 36 \\mathrm{mm}$.\nThe set of available nominal graft diameters is $D_{\\text{graft}} \\in \\{38, 40, 42\\} \\mathrm{mm}$. Let us denote these as $D_1 = 38$, $D_2 = 40$, and $D_3 = 42$.\nThe recommended oversizing range is from $10\\%$ to $20\\%$. In decimal form, this range is $[0.10, 0.20]$. Let the lower bound be $O_{\\min} = 0.10$ and the upper bound be $O_{\\max} = 0.20$.\n\nThe definition of diametric oversizing, $O$, is the relative increase of the device diameter compared to the native vessel diameter. This is formally expressed as:\n$$O = \\frac{D_{\\text{graft}} - D_{\\text{native}}}{D_{\\text{native}}}$$\n\nThe problem requires selecting the candidate graft that satisfies two conditions:\n1.  Its calculated oversizing, $O$, must fall within the recommended range: $O_{\\min} \\le O \\le O_{\\max}$.\n2.  Among the grafts that satisfy the first condition, we must select the one whose oversizing is closest to the midpoint of the recommended range.\n\nFirst, let us calculate the midpoint of the recommended oversizing range, which we will denote as $O_{\\text{target}}$.\n$$O_{\\text{target}} = \\frac{O_{\\min} + O_{\\max}}{2} = \\frac{0.10 + 0.20}{2} = 0.15$$\n\nNext, we will calculate the oversizing for each available graft diameter and check if it falls within the acceptable range $[0.10, 0.20]$.\n\nFor the first candidate graft, $D_1 = 38 \\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$O_1 = \\frac{D_1 - D_{\\text{native}}}{D_{\\text{native}}} = \\frac{38 - 36}{36} = \\frac{2}{36} = \\frac{1}{18} \\approx 0.0556$$\nThe value $O_1 \\approx 0.0556$ is less than the minimum required oversizing of $O_{\\min} = 0.10$. Therefore, the $38 \\mathrm{mm}$ graft is not a suitable candidate as it does not meet the manufacturer's instructions for use.\n\nFor the second candidate graft, $D_2 = 40 \\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$O_2 = \\frac{D_2 - D_{\\text{native}}}{D_{\\text{native}}} = \\frac{40 - 36}{36} = \\frac{4}{36} = \\frac{1}{9} \\approx 0.1111$$\nThe value $O_2 \\approx 0.1111$ is between $0.10$ and $0.20$. Thus, $O_{\\min} \\le O_2 \\le O_{\\max}$. The $40 \\mathrm{mm}$ graft is a valid candidate.\n\nFor the third candidate graft, $D_3 = 42 \\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$O_3 = \\frac{D_3 - D_{\\text{native}}}{D_{\\text{native}}} = \\frac{42 - 36}{36} = \\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.1667$$\nThe value $O_3 \\approx 0.1667$ is also between $0.10$ and $0.20$.

The validity of the laminar flow assumption must be checked, and the clinical context of the result must be discussed.\n\nFirst, we derive the Hagen-Poiseuille equation starting from the principles of conservation of momentum for a viscous fluid. We consider an incompressible Newtonian fluid in steady, fully developed, axisymmetric, laminar flow through a rigid cylinder of radius $R$ and length $L$. The flow is purely axial, so the velocity vector is $\\mathbf{v} = v_z(r) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the Navier-Stokes equation in the axial ($z$) direction simplifies considerably.

The kidneys maintain a nearly constant blood flow and glomerular filtration rate across a wide range of mean arterial perfusion pressures, typically from about $80 \\ \\text{mmHg}$ to $180 \\ \\text{mmHg}$. The calculated pressure drop across the graft is approximately $0.825 \\ \\text{mmHg}$. This value is exceedingly small compared to the systemic arterial pressures and the autoregulatory range.

This indicates that the graft itself introduces a negligible resistance to flow, ensuring that the kidney is perfused at a pressure nearly identical to that of the source artery.

All necessary data (procedural durations, conditions for ischemia) are provided, making the problem self-contained and well-posed. The language is objective and precise. The problem is a formalizable logic puzzle that requires no information beyond what is given.\n\nLet us define the three core surgical tasks:\n1.  $A_{SMA}$: The anastomosis of the Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA). This task requires a supraceliac aortic cross-clamp for a duration of $t_{SMA} = 25$ minutes.\n2.  $B_R$: The bypass of the right renal artery. This task involves isolation of the artery, causing warm ischemia to the right kidney for a duration of $t_R = 20$ minutes.\n3.  $B_L$: The bypass of the left renal artery. This task involves isolation of the artery, causing warm ischemia to the left kidney for a duration of $t_L = 20$ minutes.\n\nThe key rule governing ischemia from the supraceliac clamp is: \"The supraceliac clamp interrupts native renal perfusion unless a renal bypass has already been constructed and connected to the iliac inflow.\"\n\nThis leads to the following conditions for the total warm ischemia time for each kidney, denoted as $T_R$ for the right kidney and $T_L$ for the left kidney.\n\n-   The right kidney is ischemic for a duration $t_R = 20$ minutes during the procedure $B_R$. This is an intrinsic part of the task.\n-   The left kidney is ischemic for a duration $t_L = 20$ minutes during the procedure $B_L$. This is an intrinsic part of the task.\n-   During the SMA anastomosis ($A_{SMA}$), the right kidney experiences an additional $t_{SMA} = 25$ minutes of ischemia if, and only if, its own bypass ($B_R$) has not yet been completed.\n-   Similarly, during $A_{SMA}$, the left kidney experiences an additional $t_{SMA} = 25$ minutes of ischemia if, and only if, its own bypass ($B_L$) has not yet been completed.\n\nThe total warm ischemia time for each kidney is the sum of the durations of all periods during which it lacks arterial inflow.\n\nFirst, we compute the total warm ischemia times for the initially proposed sequence: $A_{SMA} \\rightarrow B_R \\rightarrow B_L$.\n\n1.  **Step 1: $A_{SMA}$ (duration $25$ min)**\n    -   At this point, neither $B_R$ nor $B_L$ has been performed.\n    -   The supraceliac clamp causes ischemia in both kidneys.\n    -   Ischemic contribution: $25$ minutes to $T_R$ and $25$ minutes to $T_L$.\n\n2.  **Step 2: $B_R$ (duration $20$ min)**\n    -   The right kidney is ischemic by definition of the procedure.\n    -   The supraceliac clamp is not applied during this step, so the left kidney has its native perfusion.\n    -   Ischemic contribution: $20$ minutes to $T_R$ and $0$ minutes to $T_L$.\n\n3.  **Step 3: $B_L$ (duration $20$ min)**\n    -   The left kidney is ischemic by definition of the procedure.\n    -   The right renal bypass ($B_R$) is now complete, so the right kidney is perfused from the iliac inflow, independent of native supraceliac flow.\n    -   Ischemic contribution: $0$ minutes to $T_R$ and $20$ minutes to $T_L$.\n\nThe total warm ischemia times for the initial sequence are:\n$$T_{R, \\text{initial}} = 25 \\text{ min} + 20 \\text{ min} + 0 \\text{ min} = 45 \\text{ min}$$\n$$T_{L, \\text{initial}} = 25 \\text{ min} + 0 \\text{ min} + 20 \\text{ min} = 45 \\text{ min}$$\nThese times, $45$ minutes, exceed the clinically acceptable threshold of $30$ minutes mentioned in the problem.\n\nNext, we must propose a reordered sequence to ensure each kidney's total warm ischemia remains strictly below $30$ minutes. The analysis of the initial sequence reveals that the significant ischemic penalty ($25$ minutes for both kidneys) arises from performing the SMA anastomosis before protecting the kidneys with their respective bypasses. The logical strategy is to perform both renal bypasses *before* the SMA anastomosis. This sequesters the ischemia from the supraceliac clamp, as both kidneys will be perfused via their newly created bypass grafts.\n\nLet us propose the following sequence: $B_R \\rightarrow B_L \\rightarrow A_{SMA}$.\n\n1.  **Step 1: $B_R$ (duration $20$ min)**\n    -   The right kidney is ischemic during its own bypass procedure.\n    -   The left kidney is not affected.\n    -   Ischemic contribution: $20$ minutes to $T_R$ and $0$ minutes to $T_L$.\n\n2.  **Step 2: $B_L$ (duration $20$ min)**\n    -   The left kidney is ischemic during its own bypass procedure.\n    -   The right kidney's bypass is complete, so it is perfused and not ischemic.\n    -   Ischemic contribution: $0$ minutes to $T_R$ and $20$ minutes to $T_L$.\n\n3.  **Step 3: $A_{SMA}$ (duration $25$ min)**\n    -   The supraceliac clamp is applied.\n    -   However, both $B_R$ and $B_L$ have been completed. Both kidneys are perfused via their bypass grafts from the iliac inflow.\n    -   Therefore, neither kidney experiences ischemia during this step.\n    -   Ischemic contribution: $0$ minutes to $T_R$ and $0$ minutes to $T_L$.\n\nThe total warm ischemia times for this proposed sequence are:\n$$T_R = 20 \\text{ min} + 0 \\text{ min} + 0 \\text{ min} = 20 \\text{ min}$$\n$$T_L = 0 \\text{ min} + 20 \\text{ min} + 0 \\text{ min} = 20 \\text{ min}$$\nBoth $T_R = 20$ minutes and $T_L = 20$ minutes are strictly less than $30$ minutes. This sequence is therefore valid.
