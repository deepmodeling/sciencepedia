We consider an incompressible Newtonian fluid of dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ flowing through a straight, rigid, cylindrical tube of internal radius $R$ and length $L$. The flow is driven by a constant pressure drop $\\Delta P$ across the length of thetube. Let $z$ be the axial coordinate and $r$ be the radial coordinate from the center of the tube.\n\nDue to the assumption of steady, fully developed laminar flow, there is no acceleration. Thus, the net force on any fluid element is zero. Consider a cylindrical shell of fluid of length $dz$, inner radius $r$, and outer radius $r+dr$. The forces acting on this element in the axial direction are pressure forces on its two ends and viscous shear forces on its cylindrical surfaces.\n\nThe net pressure force is given by the pressure difference acting on the annular area $2\\pi r dr$:\n$F_P = [P(z) - P(z+dz)](2\\pi r dr) = -\\frac{dP}{dz} dz (2\\pi r dr)$.\nFor a constant pressure gradient over the tube length $L$, we have $\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$.\nSo, $F_P = \\frac{\\Delta P}{L} dz (2\\pi r dr)$.\n\nThe net viscous shear force is the difference between the shear force on the outer surface (at $r+dr$) and the inner surface (at $r$). Let $\\tau(r)$ be the shear stress at radius $r$.\n$F_V = \\tau(r+dr) (2\\pi(r+dr)dz) - \\tau(r) (2\\pi r dz) = \\frac{d}{dr}(\\tau \\cdot 2\\pi r) dr dz$.\n\nFor steady flow, the sum of forces is zero: $F_P + F_V = 0$.\n$\\frac{\\Delta P}{L} (2\\pi r dr dz) + \\frac{d}{dr}(2\\pi r \\tau) dr dz = 0$.\nDividing by $2\\pi dr dz$, we get:\n$\\frac{\\Delta P}{L} r + \\frac{d(r\\tau)}{dr} = 0$.\n$\\frac{d(r\\tau)}{dr} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{L} r$.\n\nIntegrating with respect to $r$:\n$r\\tau = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2L} r^2 + C_1$.\n$\\tau(r) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2L} r + \\frac{C_1}{r}$.\nBy symmetry, the shear stress at the center of the tube ($r=0$) must be finite (in fact, zero), which requires the constant of integration $C_1=0$.\nThus, the shear stress profile is $\\tau(r) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2L} r$.\n\nFor a Newtonian fluid, the shear stress is related to the velocity gradient by $\\tau = \\mu \\frac{dv}{dr}$.\n$\\mu \\frac{dv}{dr} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2L} r$.\n$\\frac{dv}{dr} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\mu L} r$.\n\nTo find the velocity profile $v(r)$, we integrate with respect to $r$:\n$v(r) = \\int -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\mu L} r dr = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} r^2 + C_2$.\nWe apply the no-slip boundary condition at the inner wall of the tube, $v(R)=0$:\n$0 = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} R^2 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} R^2$.\nSubstituting $C_2$ back gives the parabolic velocity profile:\n$v(r) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} (R^2 - r^2)$.\n\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is obtained by integrating the velocity profile over the tube's cross-sectional area $A$.

The pressure drop $\\Delta P$, fluid viscosity $\\mu$, and tube length $L$ are identical for both.\n$\\frac{Q_{28}}{Q_{10}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi \\Delta P (d_{i,28})^4}{128 \\mu L}}{\\frac{\\pi \\Delta P (d_{i,10})^4}{128 \\mu L}} = \\left(\\frac{d_{i,28}}{d_{i,10}}\\right)^4$.\n\nWe need to find the internal diameters. The French gauge (Fr) size relates to the outer diameter $d_o$ as $1 \\text{ Fr} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ mm}$, so $d_o (\\text{in mm}) = \\frac{\\text{Fr}}{3}$. The internal diameter $d_i$ is given as $d_i = \\alpha d_o$, where $\\alpha$ is a constant for both tubes.\n\nFor the $28$ Fr tube:\n$d_{o,28} = \\frac{28}{3}$ mm.\n$d_{i,28} = \\alpha d_{o,28} = \\alpha \\frac{28}{3}$ mm.\n\nFor the $10$ Fr tube:\n$d_{o,10} = \\frac{10}{3}$ mm.\n$d_{i,10} = \\alpha d_{o,10} = \\alpha \\frac{10}{3}$ mm.\n\nThe ratio of the internal diameters is:\n$\\frac{d_{i,28}}{d_{i,10}} = \\frac{\\alpha \\frac{28}{3} \\text{ mm}}{\\alpha \\frac{10}{3} \\text{ mm}} = \\frac{28}{10} = 2.8$.\n\nNow, we can compute the ratio of the volumetric flow rates:\n$\\frac{Q_{28}}{Q_{10}} = (2.8)^4 = (7.84)^2 = 61.4656$.\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $61.47$.\n\nThe clinical implications of this result are profound. The volumetric drainage rate's dependence on the fourth power of the internal diameter ($Q \\propto d_i^4$) means that even small changes in tube size have a very large effect on flow efficiency. The calculated ratio shows that a $28$ Fr tube, under these idealized conditions, can drain fluid approximately $61.5$ times faster than a $10$ Fr tube. The outer diameter of the $28$ Fr tube is only $2.8$ times larger than the $10$ Fr tube, but its drainage capacity is vastly greater. For a patient with a large pleural effusion, selecting a larger-bore chest tube is critical for rapid fluid removal, which facilitates faster lung re-expansion and symptomatic relief. While smaller tubes are less invasive, their dramatically lower flow rates make them unsuitable for draining large volumes of even low-viscosity fluid in a timely manner. Furthermore, the model does not account for potential blockage by fibrinous strands or debris, a risk that is significantly higher in smaller-diameter tubes, further compromising their effectiveness in a real clinical scenario.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{61.47}\n$$", "id": "5171635"}]}
