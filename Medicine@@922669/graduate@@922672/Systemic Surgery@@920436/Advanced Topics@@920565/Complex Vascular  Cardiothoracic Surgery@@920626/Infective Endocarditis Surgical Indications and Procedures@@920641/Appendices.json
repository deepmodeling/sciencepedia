The process begins with validation of the problem statement, followed by a quantitative risk-benefit analysis to determine the optimal strategy, and finally an evaluation of the provided options.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n-   **Diagnosis**: Left-sided native-valve infective endocarditis.\n-   **Pathogen**: *Staphylococcus aureus*.\n-   **Echocardiographic Findings**: Mobile mitral valve vegetation, size $13\\,\\mathrm{mm}$; moderate mitral regurgitation.\n-   **Clinical History**: Single ischemic stroke occurred $36\\,\\mathrm{h}$ ago.

The clinical scenario is a classic, complex but realistic case of infective endocarditis with neurological complications. The provided quantitative data ($h_0$, $k$, surgical risks) are \"empirically grounded,\" which is an acceptable premise for a formal problem. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a quantitative risk comparison between different management strategies. The language is objective and uses standard medical terminology. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies within the problem's framework. The time points are precise: evaluation (\"now\") is at $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ ($2\\,\\mathrm{d}$) after antibiotic initiation; the stroke occurred at $48 - 36 = 12\\,\\mathrm{h}$ ($0.5\\,\\mathrm{d}$) after antibiotic initiation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. A quantitative analysis can be performed to determine the optimal management strategy.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe core of the problem is to weigh the risk of recurrent embolism while waiting for surgery against the risk of surgical complications (mortality and neurological worsening), which varies with timing. Let $t$ be the time in days from the start of antibiotic therapy. The current time is $t=2\\,\\mathrm{d}$.\n\nThe cumulative probability of an embolic event over a time interval $[T_1, T_2]$ is:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{emb}}(T_1, T_2) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\int_{T_1}^{T_2} h_{\\mathrm{emb}}(t)\\,dt\\right) $$\nThe integral of the hazard function is:\n$$ \\int_{T_1}^{T_2} h_0 e^{-kt}\\,dt = \\frac{h_0}{k} (e^{-kT_1} - e^{-kT_2}) $$\nGiven $h_0=0.04\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$ and $k=0.15\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$, the ratio is $\\frac{h_0}{k} = \\frac{0.04}{0.15} = \\frac{4}{15}$.\n\nWe must compare two primary strategies: early surgery versus delayed surgery.\n\n**Strategy 1: Early Surgery (within the next 48-72h)**\nLet's assume surgery is performed at $t=3\\,\\mathrm{d}$. The waiting period from evaluation is the interval $[2, 3]$.\nThe stroke occurred at $t=0.5\\,\\mathrm{d}$. Surgery at $t=3\\,\\mathrm{d}$ would be $3 - 0.5 = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{d}$ ($60$ hours) after the stroke, which is within the $72$-hour high-risk window for neurological complications.\n\n-   **Risk of Embolism while Waiting**: The probability of an embolic event between now ($t=2$) and surgery ($t=3$) is:\n    $$ \\int_{2}^{3} h_{\\mathrm{emb}}(t)\\,dt = \\frac{4}{15} (e^{-0.15 \\times 2} - e^{-0.15 \\times 3}) = \\frac{4}{15} (e^{-0.3} - e^{-0.45}) \\approx \\frac{4}{15} (0.7408 - 0.6376) = 0.0275 $$\n    $$ P_{\\mathrm{emb}}(2, 3) = 1 - e^{-0.0275} \\approx 0.0271 \\quad (2.71\\%) $$\n    This is the unavoidable risk of waiting even one more day.\n\n-   **Risk of Surgical Adverse Events**: For surgery at $t=3\\,\\mathrm{d}$, the risks are operative mortality $p_{\\mathrm{mort}}=0.06$ and neurological worsening $p_{\\mathrm{neuro},<72\\mathrm{h}}=0.03$. The composite probability of an adverse event (death or neurological worsening), assuming independence, is:\n    $$ p_{\\mathrm{adverse, early}} = p_{\\mathrm{mort}} + p_{\\mathrm{neuro},<72\\mathrm{h}} - p_{\\mathrm{mort}} \\times p_{\\mathrm{neuro},<72\\mathrm{h}} $$\n    $$ p_{\\mathrm{adverse, early}} = 0.06 + 0.03 - (0.06 \\times 0.03) = 0.09 - 0.0018 = 0.0882 \\quad (8.82\\%) $$\n\n**Strategy 2: Delayed Surgery (e.g., at $t=7\\,\\mathrm{d}$)**\nThis strategy aims to reduce the neurological risk by waiting. Surgery at $t=7\\,\\mathrm{d}$ is $7 - 0.5 = 6.5\\,\\mathrm{d}$ after the stroke. We will use the risk for surgery delayed \"beyond $7\\,\\mathrm{d}$\", $p_{\\mathrm{neuro},\\ge 7\\mathrm{d}}=0.01$. The waiting period is the interval $[2, 7]$.\n\n-   **Risk of Embolism while Waiting**: The probability of an embolic event between now ($t=2$) and surgery ($t=7$) is:\n    $$ \\int_{2}^{7} h_{\\mathrm{emb}}(t)\\,dt = \\frac{4}{15} (e^{-0.15 \\times 2} - e^{-0.15 \\times 7}) = \\frac{4}{15} (e^{-0.3} - e^{-1.05}) \\approx \\frac{4}{15} (0.7408 - 0.3499) = 0.1042 $$\n    $$ P_{\\mathrm{emb}}(2, 7) = 1 - e^{-0.1042} \\approx 0.0990 \\quad (9.90\\%) $$\n    The risk of embolism during this $5$-day wait is substantial.\n\n-   **Risk of Surgical Adverse Events**: For surgery at $t=7\\,\\mathrm{d}$, the neurological risk is lower.\n    $$ p_{\\mathrm{adverse, late}} = p_{\\mathrm{mort}} + p_{\\mathrm{neuro},\\ge 7\\mathrm{d}} - p_{\\mathrm{mort}} \\times p_{\\mathrm{neuro},\\ge 7\\mathrm{d}} $$\n    $$ p_{\\mathrm{adverse, late}} = 0.06 + 0.01 - (0.06 \\times 0.01) = 0.07 - 0.0006 = 0.0694 \\quad (6.94\\%) $$\n\n**Quantitative Comparison**\nThe choice is between undergoing a surgery with an $8.82\\%$ risk of adverse events soon, or waiting for a surgery with a $6.94\\%$ risk of adverse events, but accepting a $9.90\\%$ risk of a new embolic event (potentially another stroke) during the waiting period.\n\nThe reduction in surgical risk by delaying is $p_{\\mathrm{adverse, early}} - p_{\\mathrm{adverse, late}} = 8.82\\% - 6.94\\% = 1.88\\%$.\nThe additional embolic risk incurred by waiting from day $3$ to day $7$ is $P_{\\mathrm{emb}}(3, 7) = P_{\\mathrm{emb}}(2, 7) - P_{\\mathrm{emb}}(2, 3) \\approx 9.90\\% - 2.71\\% = 7.19\\%$.\n\nThe trade-off is accepting a $7.19\\%$ additional risk of embolism to achieve a $1.88\\%$ reduction in surgical adverse event risk. This is a detrimental trade. The very high, front-loaded risk of recurrent embolism argues strongly for early surgical intervention.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Proceed with early mitral valve surgery within the next $48$–$72\\,\\mathrm{h}$, after confirming no intracranial hemorrhage, to reduce embolic risk; hemodynamic stability does not preclude surgery for embolic prevention.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with our quantitative analysis. Early surgery minimizes the overall probability of an adverse outcome (recurrent embolism or surgical complication). The rationale provided is sound: the primary indication is to prevent a second embolism, the patient is at extremely high risk (large vegetation, *S. aureus*, prior event), and hemodynamic stability is not a reason to delay when the embolic risk is so high. The precaution of confirming no hemorrhage is standard and correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Defer surgery for at least $14\\,\\mathrm{d}$ because any recent ischemic stroke is a contraindication to early surgery; continue antibiotics alone unless heart failure develops.**\nThis option is incorrect. Deferring for $14\\,\\mathrm{d}$ would expose the patient to an even higher embolic risk. The risk over the interval $[2, 14]$ is $P_{\\mathrm{emb}}(2, 14) \\approx 15.2\\%$. The claim that a recent stroke is an absolute contraindication is false; it is a relative contraindication to be weighed against other risks, as quantified in this problem. Ignoring the embolic indication until heart failure develops contradicts the problem's guiding principles.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Avoid surgery altogether because the vegetation is $<15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and there has been only one embolic event; continue antibiotics and reassess after completion of therapy.**\nThis option is incorrect. Medical management alone would expose the patient to the total remaining embolic risk, which from $t=2$ onward is $P_{\\mathrm{emb}}(2, \\infty) \\approx 17.9\\%$. This risk is unacceptably high. The $15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ threshold is arbitrary and not supported by the problem's given model, which uses a $>10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ criterion. The occurrence of one embolic event is a powerful argument *for* intervention, not against it, as it marks the vegetation as unstable.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Delay surgery for $7\\,\\mathrm{d}$ to lower neurological risk, because embolic risk becomes negligible under antibiotics and hemodynamic stability obviates the need for urgent intervention.**\nThis option is incorrect. Its premises are factually wrong according to our analysis. The embolic risk while waiting for $7$ days is approximately $9.9\\%$, which is far from \"negligible\". Furthermore, the statement that hemodynamic stability obviates the need for urgent surgery is directly contradicted by the explicit text of the problem setup. While delaying does lower the neurological risk, this benefit is far outweighed by the high interval embolic risk.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5135080"}, {"introduction": "A new conduction block in a patient with aortic valve endocarditis is a red flag for a life-threatening complication, signaling that the infection has burrowed beyond the valve leaflet into adjacent tissue.

It presents a clinically realistic and internally consistent scenario that is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective. It is free of the flaws listed in the instructions. The data provided are sufficient and relevant for deriving a solution based on established principles of cardiac anatomy, pathophysiology, and surgery.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   Patient age: $55$ years\n-   Clinical presentation: fever, new systolic murmur\n-   Microbiology: positive blood cultures for *Staphylococcus aureus*\n-   Diagnosis: Infective Endocarditis (IE)\n-   Initial imaging (Transthoracic Echocardiography): Aortic valve vegetations\n-   Clinical progression: At day $5$ of intravenous antibiotics, a new first-degree Atrioventricular (AV) block develops.\n-   Further progression: The first-degree AV block progresses to complete heart block within $24$ hours.\n-   Advanced imaging (Transesophageal Echocardiography - TEE): Suggests thickening and heterogeneity of the posterior aortic annulus with a suspected periannular collection.\n-   Hemodynamic status: Stable.\n-   Microbiological status: Persistent bacteremia.\n-   Question: Explain why new-onset conduction block in aortic valve IE is a concern for periannular abscess, and justify how this influences operative timing and reconstructive strategy.\n\n### Step 2: Validation\nThe problem is **valid**. The presented case is a classic, though severe, manifestation of complicated aortic valve endocarditis. The link between *S. aureus* IE, perivalvular abscess formation, and new-onset heart block is a well-established concept in cardiovascular medicine. The progression of ECG changes, persistent bacteremia despite antibiotics, and TEE findings are all mutually reinforcing pieces of evidence pointing to an uncontrolled, burrowing infection. The question asks for a rational explanation based on fundamental principles, which is an appropriate task for scientific and clinical reasoning.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe question requires an explanation rooted in two key areas: the anatomy of the cardiac conduction system relative to the aortic valve, and the pathophysiology of complicated infective endocarditis.\n\n1.  **Anatomical Principles:** The heart's fibrous skeleton provides structural support for the valves. The aortic valve is centrally located. The cardiac conduction system, which coordinates the heart's contractions, originates at the sinoatrial node. The electrical impulse travels to the atrioventricular (AV) node, located in the atrial septum. From the AV node, the His bundle (or AV bundle) arises, which is the sole electrical connection between the atria and the ventricles. The His bundle penetrates the central fibrous body and travels along the crest of the muscular interventricular septum. Its initial portion courses through the membranous septum. This anatomical course places the His bundle in immediate proximity to the aortic annulus, specifically adjacent to the commissure between the non-coronary cusp (NCC) and the right coronary cusp (RCC).\n\n2.  **Pathophysiological Principles:** Infective endocarditis, particularly with virulent organisms like *Staphylococcus aureus*, is not always confined to the valve leaflets. The infection can invade and destroy adjacent tissues, a process known as perivalvular extension. This destructive process can lead to the formation of a periannular abscess, which is a collection of pus and necrotic debris walled off from the systemic circulation.\n\n**Synthesis and Justification:**\n\n**Why Conduction Block Raises Concern for Abscess:**\nThe development of a new AV conduction abnormality in a patient with aortic valve IE is a cardinal sign of perivalvular extension. The close anatomical relationship between the His bundle and the aortic annulus is the critical link. An abscess extending from the aortic valve annulus, especially in the region of the membranous septum near the NCC and RCC, can directly compress, inflame, or necrotize the His bundle.\n-   Initial inflammation or mild compression can delay conduction, manifesting as a **first-degree AV block** (PR interval prolongation).\n-   As the abscess expands and destruction worsens, the injury to the His bundle becomes more severe, leading to intermittent failure of conduction (second-degree AV block) or complete transection of the electrical pathway, resulting in **complete heart block**.\nThe rapid progression from first-degree to complete block within $24$ hours, as described in the problem, strongly suggests an aggressive, expanding destructive process, i.e., a growing abscess. Persistent bacteremia, despite appropriate antibiotics, corroborates this, as antibiotics cannot effectively penetrate the walled-off, avascular abscess cavity. The TEE findings of a periannular collection provide direct visual evidence supporting this conclusion.\n\n**Influence on Operative Timing and Strategy:**\nThe diagnosis of a periannular abscess fundamentally changes the management of IE.\n-   **Operative Timing:** A periannular abscess with progressive heart block constitutes an uncontrolled infection and is a **Class I indication for urgent surgery**. The primary goal is source control. Relying on antibiotics alone is futile and dangerous, as the abscess will continue to destroy tissue, potentially leading to pseudoaneurysms, intracardiac fistulas, valve dehiscence, or catastrophic rupture. The patient's hemodynamic stability is fortunate but does not reduce the urgency; waiting for hemodynamic collapse portends a much higher operative mortality.\n-   **Reconstructive Strategy:** The surgical procedure is no longer a simple valve replacement. It must be a radical operation focused on eradicating all infected tissue. The principles are:\n    1.  **Radical Debridement:** All infected, necrotic, and abscess-filled tissue must be excised until healthy, viable, bleeding tissue planes are reached.\n    2.  **Abscess Drainage:** The abscess cavity must be fully opened (\"unroofed\") and its contents evacuated.\n    3.  **Annular Reconstruction:** The radical debridement often leaves a large defect in the aortic annulus and surrounding structures (e.g., the roof of the left atrium, the ventricular septum, the aorto-mitral curtain). This defect must be reconstructed to provide a solid foundation for a new prosthesis. This is typically done using a patch of autologous or bovine pericardium.\n    4.  **Prosthetic Implantation:** Once the annulus is reconstructed, either a new prosthetic aortic valve is implanted, or if destruction is too extensive, a complete aortic root replacement (e.g., with a valved conduit, a homograft, or a bioprosthetic root) is performed. The extent of reconstruction is dictated by the intraoperative findings. If the infection extends posteriorly to involve the fibrous tissue between the aortic and mitral valves (the aorto-mitral curtain), an even more complex reconstruction is required.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The progression from PR prolongation to complete AV block arises because periannular infection tracks into the membranous septum adjacent to the non-coronary and right coronary cusps, injuring the His bundle; this anatomy makes conduction block a marker of abscess extension.**\nThis statement is a precise and accurate summary of the relevant anatomy and pathophysiology. It correctly identifies the location of the His bundle relative to the aortic cusps and explains how infection tracking into this area leads to progressive conduction block. It correctly concludes that this clinical sign is a marker for abscess extension.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. New-onset conduction block in aortic valve IE is a minor finding that should prompt watchful waiting unless overt heart failure develops; surgery is not indicated solely on the basis of conduction abnormalities.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect and dangerous. According to all major societal guidelines (e.g., from the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology), new-onset moderate or high-grade AV block in the setting of IE is a major complication and a Class I indication for urgent surgery. It is a sign of uncontrolled infection, not a \"minor finding\". Waiting for heart failure would be an inappropriate and high-risk delay.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The finding of conduction block with suspected periannular extension mandates urgent surgical exploration for annular abscess, including wide debridement, abscess unroofing and drainage, annular reconstruction with a patch, and valve or root replacement as dictated by the extent of destruction.**\nThis statement accurately describes the modern standard of care for aortic root abscess. It correctly identifies the urgent need for surgery and outlines the essential components of the surgical procedure: aggressive debridement for source control, reconstruction of the annulus, and definitive valve or root replacement. This aligns perfectly with the principles derived above.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) is of limited utility for detecting annular abscesses; Computed Tomography (CT) should be obtained first, and surgical intervention should be deferred until cross-sectional imaging confirms the diagnosis.**\nThis statement is incorrect. TEE is the primary and most sensitive imaging modality for evaluating valvular structures and detecting perivalvular complications of IE, including abscesses. While ECG-gated cardiac CT is a valuable adjunct, particularly for assessing complex anatomy or when TEE is non-diagnostic, TEE is by no means of \"limited utility\"—it is the cornerstone of imaging. Furthermore, in a patient with progressive complete heart block and persistent bacteremia, deferring urgent surgery to obtain additional imaging would be an unnecessary and potentially harmful delay. The clinical evidence is already compelling.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Involvement of the aorto-mitral curtain necessitates complex reconstruction that may include double patch repair of the intervalvular fibrosa and consideration of aortic root replacement; failure to address this extension increases the risk of residual infection, fistula formation, and recurrent conduction disturbances.**\nThis statement describes the surgical management required for a specific and severe pattern of periannular extension—posteriorly, into the aorto-mitral curtain (intervalvular fibrosa). It correctly identifies that this situation requires highly complex reconstructive techniques and that failure to perform a radical-enough debridement and reconstruction leads to catastrophic complications. This is a correct statement of surgical principle, providing specific detail on the \"reconstructive strategy\" part of the problem's prompt. While the classic location for heart block is an anterior abscess (NCC-RCC), posterior abscesses can also cause conduction issues and represent a major surgical challenge, as described.

Your justification should explain, using the given geometry ($C$ and $L$) and the conceptual burden model $B = B_0 e^{-\\alpha A}$, why extensive annular involvement mandates valve replacement rather than repair and how limited debridement increases the risk of persistent infection, patch/ring dehiscence, and relapse.", "solution": "Begin from the stated principles. Infective endocarditis creates infected, devitalized tissue and biofilm within the valve leaflets and annulus. Antibiotics, even when appropriately dosed, have reduced efficacy in the presence of biofilm and necrotic substrate, so surgical source control—complete debridement to healthy tissue—is required to lower the residual bacterial burden $B$ below a clinical threshold $B_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ necessary to prevent persistent bacteremia and relapse. From the conceptual model $B = B_0 e^{-\\alpha A}$, larger $A$ (the area of infected tissue removed) results in exponentially lower $B$. Conversely, leaving infected annular tissue in situ (small $A$) will keep $B$ high, risking continued infection and structural failure.\n\nFor a durable mitral repair, sutures and annuloplasty rings must be anchored in viable, structurally sound tissue. The mechanical load of the ring is distributed circumferentially; inadequate contiguous healthy annulus increases stress concentration and risks suture cut-through and dehiscence. Using the geometric data, the mitral annular circumference is $C = 9.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, and contiguous annular destruction is $L = 5.4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. Thus, the proportion of annulus destroyed is $L/C = 5.4/9.0 = 0.6$, i.e., $60\\%$. Only $C - L = 3.6\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ of annulus remains intact, and in native geometry, it is unlikely to be a single contiguous segment—it is typically split across anterior and posterior segments, further reducing usable length per segment. Annuloplasty rings generally require multiple centimeters of contiguous healthy tissue circumferentially to distribute forces; an intact length of approximately $3.6\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ total renders repair precarious. In such a scenario, repair strategies that rely on anchoring a ring to the posterior annulus are mechanically unsound.\n\nMoreover, the presence of a $2.0\\,\\mathrm{cm} \\times 1.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ abscess at the posterior annulus means that any limited debridement leaving portions of the abscess wall or necrotic annular tissue will preserve biofilm niches. If limited debridement removes area $A_{\\mathrm{limited}}$ insufficient to encompass the entire abscess and destroyed annulus, the residual burden $B = B_0 e^{-\\alpha A_{\\mathrm{limited}}}$ remains above $B_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ for plausible parameter values (for example, if $B_0$ is large due to persistent bacteremia and $\\alpha$ is constrained by biofilm, small $A_{\\mathrm{limited}}$ yields $B/B_0$ close to $1$). Therefore, limited repair strategies that avoid radical annular debridement—intended to preserve tissue—paradoxically increase the risk of ongoing infection and early failure (ring dehiscence, pseudoaneurysm expansion, or fistula formation).\n\nHaving established these constraints, we assess each option:\n\nA. Limited leaflet/chordal repair with abscess drainage but without radical annular debridement is conceptually flawed. It preserves infected annular tissue (small $A$), keeping $B$ high via $B = B_0 e^{-\\alpha A}$, and places sutures/rings near or through compromised tissue. With $L/C = 0.6$, the posterior annulus lacks sufficient contiguous viable length for safe anchoring. This strategy risks persistent bacteremia, annular patch or ring dehiscence, and relapse. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nB. Radical debridement to healthy margins, including unroofing the abscess and resecting destroyed posterior annulus, followed by mitral valve replacement (with the sewing ring anchored to non-infected, viable myocardium or reconstructed tissue) directly implements source control (large $A$, hence much smaller $B$) and provides a mechanically durable solution that does not depend on compromised annular segments. Reconstruction of the atrioventricular groove with a patch restores integrity where needed, and early surgery is indicated due to persistent bacteremia and heart failure. In the setting of $60\\%$ annular destruction, replacement is mandated because repair lacks adequate anchoring substrate. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. Prolonged antibiotics alone delay source control and allow continued hemodynamic compromise (severe MR with effective regurgitant orifice $0.4\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2$) and risk of embolization or abscess extension. Persistent bacteremia after $7$ days indicates failure of medical therapy alone. Without debridement, $A = 0$, so $B = B_0$, which exceeds $B_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Quadrangular resection of P2 with chordal resuspension and non-circumferential annuloplasty that avoids the most damaged segment still relies on suturing within or adjacent to infected/compromised tissue. Given $L = 5.4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, attempting to “skip” the damaged segment leaves insufficient healthy annulus ($3.6\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ total) for load distribution, increasing stress and dehiscence risk. Limited debridement keeps $B$ elevated per $B = B_0 e^{-\\alpha A}$ if the abscess wall remains. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (clip) is contraindicated in active infective endocarditis. It places foreign material into an infected field without source control, increasing the risk of device infection and embolization, while failing to address the abscess or annular destruction. With no debridement ($A \\approx 0$), $B$ remains high. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, in the presence of extensive annular involvement (majority of posterior annulus destroyed, abscess present), the correct approach is radical debridement and mitral valve replacement, because repair cannot be anchored safely and limited debridement leaves residual infection. Option B best aligns with the first principles of source control and biomechanical feasibility.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5135026"}]}
