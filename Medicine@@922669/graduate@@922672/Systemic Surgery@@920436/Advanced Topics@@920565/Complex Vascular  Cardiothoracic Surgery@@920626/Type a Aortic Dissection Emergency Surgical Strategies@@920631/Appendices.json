The calculation must adhere to a specified maximum flow velocity to ensure patient safety.\n\nThe analysis begins with the foundational principles provided. First, the total required CPB flow rate, $Q$, is determined by the product of the cardiac index and the patient's Body Surface Area (BSA).\nGiven:\nCardiac Index $= 2.4 \\text{ L/min/m}^{2}$\nBody Surface Area (BSA) $= 2.0 \\text{ m}^{2}$\n\nThe flow rate $Q$ is calculated as:\n$$Q = (2.4 \\text{ L/min/m}^{2}) \\times (2.0 \\text{ m}^{2}) = 4.8 \\text{ L/min}$$\n\nFor consistency with other physical quantities, this flow rate must be converted to SI units of cubic meters per second (m³/s). The conversion factors are $1 \\text{ L} = 10^{-3} \\text{ m}^{3}$ and $1 \\text{ min} = 60 \\text{ s}$.\n$$Q = 4.8 \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{min}} \\times \\frac{10^{-3} \\text{ m}^{3}}{1 \\text{ L}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ min}}{60 \\text{ s}} = \\frac{4.8 \\times 10^{-3}}{60} \\frac{\\text{m}^{3}}{\\text{s}}$$\n$$Q = 0.08 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}^{3}/\\text{s} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ m}^{3}/\\text{s}$$\n\nNext, we use the continuity equation for fluid flow, which relates the volumetric flow rate $Q$ to the fluid's average velocity $v$ and the cross-sectional area $A$ of the conduit:\n$$Q = vA$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the cannula has a circular cross-section with an internal diameter $d$. The area $A$ is therefore given by:\n$$A = \\frac{\\pi d^{2}}{4}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $A$ into the continuity equation gives:\n$$Q = v \\left(\\frac{\\pi d^{2}}{4}\\right)$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the diameter $d$:\n$$d^{2} = \\frac{4Q}{\\pi v}$$\n$$d = \\sqrt{\\frac{4Q}{\\pi v}}$$\n\nThe problem imposes a critical constraint on the axial tip velocity, $v$, to prevent jet-induced vascular injury. The velocity must not exceed a maximum value, $v_{\\max}$.\n$$v \\le v_{\\max} = 1.6 \\text{ m/s}$$\n\nFrom the equation for $d$, we can see that the diameter $d$ is inversely proportional to the square root of the velocity $v$. To find the *minimum* required diameter, $d_{\\min}$, that can accommodate the flow rate $Q$, we must use the *maximum* permissible velocity, $v_{\\max}$. A velocity lower than $v_{\\max}$ would necessitate a larger diameter, and a diameter smaller than this minimum would require a velocity exceeding $v_{\\max}$ to deliver the same flow $Q$, thus violating the constraint. Therefore, the minimum diameter is calculated by setting $v = v_{\\max}$:\n$$d_{\\min} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4Q}{\\pi v_{\\max}}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for $Q$ and $v_{\\max}$:\n$Q = 8.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ m}^{3}/\\text{s}$\n$v_{\\max} = 1.6 \\text{ m/s}$\n\n$$d_{\\min} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4 \\times (8.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ m}^{3}/\\text{s})}{\\pi \\times (1.6 \\text{ m/s})}}$$\n$$d_{\\min} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3.2 \\times 10^{-4}}{\\pi \\times 1.6} \\text{ m}^{2}}$$\n$$d_{\\min} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{\\pi} \\text{ m}^{2}}$$\n$$d_{\\min} \\approx \\sqrt{6.3661977 \\times 10^{-5}} \\text{ m}$$\n$$d_{\\min} \\approx 0.0079788 \\text{ m}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in millimeters (mm) and rounded to three significant figures.
