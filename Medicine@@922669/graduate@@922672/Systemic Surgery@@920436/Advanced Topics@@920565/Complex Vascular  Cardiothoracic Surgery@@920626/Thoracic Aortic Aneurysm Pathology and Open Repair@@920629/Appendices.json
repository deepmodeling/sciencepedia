The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe first step is to derive the relationship for hoop stress in a thin-walled cylinder. We consider a segment of the cylindrical vessel of length $L$. A conceptual longitudinal cut is made through the diameter of the cylinder to expose the internal forces.\n\nUnder static equilibrium, the \"bursting\" force due to the internal pressure $P$ must be balanced by the resisting force in the vessel wall.\n\nThe bursting force, $F_{burst}$, acts on the projected area of the internal fluid. This projected area is a rectangle with dimensions $2r \\times L$. The force is therefore:\n$$F_{burst} = P \\times (2rL)$$\n\nThe resisting force, $F_{resist}$, arises from the hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ acting on the cross-sectional area of the cut wall. Since the cut exposes two sections of the wall, each with a cross-sectional area of approximately $t \\times L$ (valid under the thin-wall assumption $t \\ll r$), the total resisting area is $2tL$. The resisting force is the product of the hoop stress and this total area:\n$$F_{resist} = \\sigma_{\\theta} \\times (2tL)$$\n\nFor static equilibrium, these two forces must be equal:\n$$F_{burst} = F_{resist}$$\n$$P \\times (2rL) = \\sigma_{\\theta} \\times (2tL)$$\n\nThe length $L$ and the factor of $2$ cancel from both sides of the equation:\n$$Pr = \\sigma_{\\theta}t$$\n\nThis equation relates the hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ to the pressure $P$, radius $r$, and thickness $t$. This is often referred to as Barlow's formula. We can express the hoop stress explicitly as:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{Pr}{t}$$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation.\n\nThe second part of the task is to find the critical radius, $r_{c}$. Failure is defined to occur when the hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ reaches the material's tensile strength, $\\sigma_{c}$. At this point, the radius is the critical radius, $r_{c}$. Substituting these conditions into the derived formula:\n$$\\sigma_{c} = \\frac{Pr_{c}}{t}$$\n\nSolving for the critical radius $r_{c}$ gives:\n$$r_{c}(t, \\sigma_{c}, P) = \\frac{\\sigma_{c}t}{P}$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the critical radius.\n\nThe final task is to evaluate this expression numerically. The provided values are:\n- $P = 100$ mmHg\n- $t = 0.5$ mm\n- $\\sigma_{c} = 0.60$ MPa\n- Conversion: 1 mmHg = 133.322 Pa\n\nTo ensure consistency, we must convert all quantities to a standard system of units, such as the International System of Units (SI: meters, pascals, etc.).\n\nFirst, convert the pressure $P$ from mmHg to Pascals (Pa):\n$$P = 100 \\text{ mmHg} \\times \\frac{133.322 \\text{ Pa}}{1 \\text{ mmHg}} = 13332.2 \\text{ Pa}$$\n\nNext, convert the wall thickness $t$ from millimeters (mm) to meters (m):\n$$t = 0.5 \\text{ mm} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}$$\n\nThen, convert the critical stress $\\sigma_{c}$ from megapascals (MPa) to Pascals (Pa):\n$$\\sigma_{c} = 0.60 \\text{ MPa} = 0.60 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ Pa}$$\n\nNow, substitute these SI values into the equation for the critical radius $r_{c}$:\n$$r_{c} = \\frac{\\sigma_{c}t}{P} = \\frac{(0.60 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ Pa}) \\times (0.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m})}{13332.2 \\text{ Pa}}$$\n\nCalculate the numerator:\n$$(0.60 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (0.5 \\times 10^{-3}) = (0.60 \\times 0.5) \\times 10^{6-3} = 0.30 \\times 10^{3} = 300 \\text{ Pa} \\cdot \\text{m}$$\n\nNow, perform the division:\n$$r_{c} = \\frac{300 \\text{ Pa} \\cdot \\text{m}}{13332.2 \\text{ Pa}} \\approx 0.02250219 \\text{ m}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer in millimeters (mm). We convert the result from meters to millimeters:\n$$r_{c} \\approx 0.02250219 \\text{ m} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ mm}}{1 \\text{ m}} \\approx 22.50219 \\text{ mm}$$\n\nFinally, we round the result to $3$ significant figures. The first three significant figures are $2$, $2$, and $5$. The fourth digit is $0$, so we round down.\n$$r_{c} \\approx 22.5 \\text{ mm}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{22.5}$$", "id": "5193123"}, {"introduction": "A successful aortic repair depends on a durable, leak-free anastomosis between the prosthetic graft and the native aorta.

The cylinder is subjected to a uniform internal transmural pressure $P$. To find the circumferential stress, $\\sigma_h$, we perform a static force balance on a conceptual element. We imagine cutting the cylinder in half longitudinally over an axial length $L$.\n\nThe force exerted by the internal pressure on the projected internal area ($2r \\times L$) tends to push the two halves apart. This force, $F_P$, is given by:\n$$ F_P = P \\cdot (2rL) $$\nThis separating force must be balanced by the internal tensile forces within the material of the cylinder wall. The stress acting to resist this force is the circumferential or hoop stress, $\\sigma_h$. This stress acts over the cross-sectional area of the two cut wall sections, which is $A_{wall} = 2 \\cdot (tL)$. The total restraining force in the wall, $F_{wall}$, is therefore:\n$$ F_{wall} = \\sigma_h \\cdot A_{wall} = \\sigma_h \\cdot (2tL) $$\nFor static equilibrium, the forces must balance:\n$$ F_P = F_{wall} $$\n$$ P \\cdot (2rL) = \\sigma_h \\cdot (2tL) $$\nThe terms $2$ and $L$ cancel from both sides, yielding the relationship between hoop stress, pressure, and geometry, known as Barlow's formula:\n$$ \\sigma_h = \\frac{Pr}{t} $$\nThe problem defines the circumferential suture line tension, $T$, as the circumferential load per unit axial length. This tension is the total tensile force carried by the wall thickness, integrated over that thickness, per unit length along the cylinder's axis.

The sutures transfer this macroscopic load to the native aortic tissue. The use of pledgets and external felt does not alter this total load, but rather changes how the load is distributed at the microscopic level to prevent material failure (i.e., tissue tearing).\n\nThe mechanism involves two primary principles: stress distribution and management of stiffness gradients.\n1.  **Stress Reduction via Increased Contact Area**: Native aortic tissue, particularly when diseased (aneurysmal or dissected), can be friable and have low tear strength. A suture passing through the tissue concentrates the entire load it carries onto a very small area of tissue at the suture hole. Stress is defined as force per unit area ($\\sigma = F/A$). By placing a pledget (a small pad of inert, strong material like Teflon felt) under the suture knot, the force from the suture is no longer applied to the small tissue hole but is distributed over the larger surface area of the pledget. This increase in area $A$ drastically reduces the local stress $\\sigma$ on the delicate tissue, preventing the suture from acting like a \"cheese-wire\" and tearing through.\n2.  **Load Redistribution and Stiffness Gradient Management**: An external felt wrap placed around the entire anastomosis acts as a buttress. It reinforces the suture line globally, helping to distribute the circumferential tension ($T$) more evenly among all the sutures and preventing localized pull-through. Furthermore, there is a significant mechanical mismatch between the stiff synthetic Dacron graft and the more compliant native aorta. This abrupt change in material properties creates a stress concentration at the anastomosis, as the two materials deform differently under pressure. The external felt wrap helps to create a more gradual transition in stiffness from the graft to the aorta. This \"tapering\" of the effective stiffness of the composite structure mitigates the stress concentration at the suture line, reducing peak stresses on the sutures and tissue, thereby lowering the risk of anastomotic dehiscence or tearing.\n\nIn summary, while the total line tension $T$ is fixed by physics ($T=Pr$), pledgets and external felt are crucial biomechanical adjuncts that manage local stresses to stay below the ultimate tensile strength of the friable native tissue.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{299}$$", "id": "5193146"}, {"introduction": "Open repair of extensive thoracoabdominal aneurysms places the spinal cord at risk of ischemic injury, a devastating complication.

Intraoperative spinal cord protection strategies center on manipulating driving pressure and counterpressure within the spinal canal. Starting from the fundamental hemodynamic principle that perfusion of any organ is driven by the difference between its arterial inflow pressure and the opposing extrinsic pressure acting on its microvasculature, derive an expression for spinal cord perfusion pressure in terms of mean arterial pressure and cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Assume that central venous pressure remains lower than cerebrospinal fluid pressure throughout and therefore does not set the effective outflow pressure.\n\nAn arterial line at the level of the descending thoracic aorta reads a mean arterial pressure of $80$ mmHg, and a lumbar drain transducer reads a cerebrospinal fluid pressure of $12$ mmHg.

For the spinal cord, the arterial inflow pressure is the mean arterial pressure ($P_{MAP}$), and the primary opposing extrinsic pressure is the cerebrospinal fluid pressure ($P_{CSFP}$). The problem states to assume that central venous pressure is not the limiting factor. Therefore, the governing relationship is:\n$$P_{SCPP} = P_{MAP} - P_{CSFP}$$\n\nThe objective is to find the minimum target $P_{MAP}$ required to achieve a specified $P_{SCPP}$.

Therefore, we use the minimum safe value for $P_{CSFP}$ in our calculation.\n\nSubstituting the target $P_{SCPP}$ and the minimum safe $P_{CSFP}$ into the rearranged equation:\n$$P_{MAP_{min}} = P_{SCPP_{target}} + P_{CSFP_{min}}$$\n$$P_{MAP_{min}} = 80 \\text{ mmHg} + 10 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n$$P_{MAP_{min}} = 90 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\nThe other values provided in the problem statement, such as the initial $P_{MAP}$ of $80 \\text{ mmHg}$, the initial $P_{CSFP}$ of $12 \\text{ mmHg}$, and the ischemic threshold of $60 \\text{ mmHg}$, are context for the clinical scenario but are not required for the calculation of the specific quantity requested.
