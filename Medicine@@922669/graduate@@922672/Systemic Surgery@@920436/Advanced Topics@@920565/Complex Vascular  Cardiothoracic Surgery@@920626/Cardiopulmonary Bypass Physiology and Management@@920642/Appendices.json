The solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Qualitative Analysis**\n\nThe problem states that we must start from the fundamental hemodynamic relation that the pressure drop across a resistor equals flow times resistance. Let the pressure drop be denoted by $\\Delta P$, the flow by $Q$, and the resistance by SVR. The relation is:\n$$ \\Delta P = Q \\times \\text{SVR} $$\nIn the context of systemic circulation, the pressure drops from the mean pressure in the large arteries (proximal to the resistance), which is the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), to the mean pressure in the large veins (distal to the resistance), which is the Central Venous Pressure (CVP). Therefore, the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ is given by:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\text{MAP} - \\text{CVP} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\Delta P$ into the fundamental relation yields:\n$$ \\text{MAP} - \\text{CVP} = Q \\times \\text{SVR} $$\nTo find how MAP depends on the pump flow $Q$, we rearrange this equation to solve for MAP:\n$$ \\text{MAP}(Q) = (\\text{SVR}) \\cdot Q + \\text{CVP} $$\nThis equation describes the relationship between MAP and $Q$ when SVR and CVP are held constant.\n\nThis relationship is linear, of the form $y = mx + b$, where:\n- The dependent variable $y$ is the Mean Arterial Pressure, MAP.\n- The independent variable $x$ is the pump flow, $Q$.\n- The slope of the line, $m$, is the Systemic Vascular Resistance, SVR.\n- The y-intercept of the line, $b$, is the Central Venous Pressure, CVP.\n\nQualitatively, this linear relationship means that for every incremental change in pump flow $Q$, the MAP changes by a proportional amount, assuming SVR and CVP remain constant. The rate of this change is determined by the SVR; a higher SVR results in a greater increase in MAP for the same increase in flow. The CVP represents the baseline pressure in the arterial system, which would be the theoretical MAP if the pump flow were reduced to zero.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to find the pump flow $Q$ required to achieve a MAP of $70$ mmHg, given an SVR of $900$ dyn·s·cm$^{-5}$ and a CVP of $5$ mmHg. We use the rearranged formula for $Q$:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\text{MAP} - \\text{CVP}}{\\text{SVR}} $$\nThe units must be consistent. The SVR is given in CGS units (centimeter-gram-second), specifically dyn·s·cm$^{-5}$. Therefore, we must convert the pressures MAP and CVP from mmHg to the CGS unit of pressure, dyn·cm$^{-2}$, using the provided conversion factor $1$ mmHg = $1333$ dyn·cm$^{-2}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the pressure drop, $\\Delta P = \\text{MAP} - \\text{CVP}$, in mmHg:\n$$ \\Delta P = 70 \\text{ mmHg} - 5 \\text{ mmHg} = 65 \\text{ mmHg} $$\nNext, convert this pressure drop to dyn·cm$^{-2}$:\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{dyn}} = 65 \\text{ mmHg} \\times \\frac{1333 \\text{ dyn·cm}^{-2}}{1 \\text{ mmHg}} = 86645 \\text{ dyn·cm}^{-2} $$\nNow we can calculate the flow $Q$ in CGS units (cm$^{3}$·s$^{-1}$):\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{dyn}}}{\\text{SVR}} = \\frac{86645 \\text{ dyn·cm}^{-2}}{900 \\text{ dyn·s·cm}^{-5}} \\approx 96.2722 \\text{ cm}^{3}\\text{·s}^{-1} $$\nThe final answer must be expressed in liters per minute (L/min). We use the given conversion factors: $1$ L = $1000$ cm$^{3}$ and $1$ min = $60$ s.\n$$ Q_{\\text{L/min}} = Q_{\\text{cm}^{3}\\text{/s}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ L}}{1000 \\text{ cm}^{3}} \\times \\frac{60 \\text{ s}}{1 \\text{ min}} $$\n$$ Q_{\\text{L/min}} = 96.2722 \\frac{\\text{cm}^{3}}{\\text{s}} \\times \\frac{60}{1000} \\frac{\\text{L·s}}{\\text{min·cm}^{3}} \\approx 5.77633 \\text{ L/min} $$\nFinally, rounding the result to three significant figures as required:\n$$ Q \\approx 5.78 \\text{ L/min} $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{5.78} $$", "id": "5093172"}, {"introduction": "Beyond establishing stable hemodynamics, the ultimate purpose of CPB is to ensure adequate oxygen delivery ($D_{O_2}$) to the body's tissues.

The derived expression is:\n$$C_{aO_2} = (Hb \\cdot k_H \\cdot S_{aO_2}) + (\\alpha_{O_2} \\cdot P_{aO_2})$$\nThe units for $C_{aO_2}$ are typically $\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{O_2}$ per $\\mathrm{dL}$ of blood.\n\nNow, we calculate the components and total $C_{aO_2}$ for the two given partial pressures. The hemoglobin-bound component is constant because $Hb$ and $S_{aO_2}$ are held constant.\n$C_{HbO_2} = (8.0\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}) \\cdot (1.34\\,\\mathrm{mL/g}) \\cdot (1.00) = 10.72\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{O_2}/\\mathrm{dL}$.\n\n**Case 1: $P_{aO_2} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$**\nThe dissolved oxygen component is:\n$C_{dissolved O_2, 100} = (3.10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{O_2}\\,\\mathrm{dL^{-1}}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg^{-1}}) \\cdot (100\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}) = 0.310\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{O_2}/\\mathrm{dL}$.\nThe total arterial oxygen content is:\n$C_{aO_2, 100} = C_{HbO_2} + C_{dissolved O_2, 100} = 10.72 + 0.310 = 11.03\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{O_2}/\\mathrm{dL}$.\nAt $P_{aO_2} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, the relative contribution of dissolved oxygen is $\\frac{0.310}{11.03} \\approx 0.0281$, or $2.8\\%$.\n\n**Case 2: $P_{aO_2} = 400\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$**\nThe dissolved oxygen component is:\n$C_{dissolved O_2, 400} = (3.10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{O_2}\\,\\mathrm{dL^{-1}}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg^{-1}}) \\cdot (400\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}) = 1.24\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{O_2}/\\mathrm{dL}$.\nThe total arterial oxygen content is:\n$C_{aO_2, 400} = C_{HbO_2} + C_{dissolved O_2, 400} = 10.72 + 1.24 = 11.96\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{O_2}/\\mathrm{dL}$.\nAt $P_{aO_2} = 400\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, the relative contribution of dissolved oxygen is $\\frac{1.24}{11.96} \\approx 0.1037$, or $10.4\\%$.\n\n**Explanation**: Under the stated conditions, oxygen bound to hemoglobin is the dominant contributor to total arterial oxygen content. At a normal $P_{aO_2}$ of $100\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, dissolved oxygen accounts for less than $3\\%$ of the total. Increasing the $P_{aO_2}$ to $400\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ (hyperoxia) quadruples the amount of dissolved oxygen. However, because $S_{aO_2}$ is already $1.00$, the hemoglobin component cannot increase. This increase in dissolved oxygen raises its relative contribution to about $10\\%$ of the total oxygen content, but the absolute increase in total oxygen content is modest, from $11.03$ to $11.96\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{O_2}/\\mathrm{dL}$.\n\n(b) Calculation of the change in systemic oxygen delivery ($\\Delta D_{O_2}$).\n\nSystemic oxygen delivery ($D_{O_2}$) is defined by Principle 3 as:\n$$D_{O_2} = Q \\cdot C_{aO_2}$$\nThe change in oxygen delivery, $\\Delta D_{O_2}$, when $P_{aO_2}$ increases from $P_{aO_2,1}=100\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ to $P_{aO_2,2}=400\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ is:\n$$\\Delta D_{O_2} = D_{O_2,2} - D_{O_2,1} = Q \\cdot C_{aO_2,400} - Q \\cdot C_{aO_2,100}$$\n$$\\Delta D_{O_2} = Q \\cdot (C_{aO_2,400} - C_{aO_2,100})$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{aO_2}$:\n$$\\Delta D_{O_2} = Q \\cdot \\left[ \\left( (Hb \\cdot k_H \\cdot S_{aO_2}) + (\\alpha_{O_2} \\cdot P_{aO_2,2}) \\right) - \\left( (Hb \\cdot k_H \\cdot S_{aO_2}) + (\\alpha_{O_2} \\cdot P_{aO_2,1}) \\right) \\right]$$\nSince $Hb$, $k_H$, and $S_{aO_2}$ are constant, the hemoglobin-bound term cancels:\n$$\\Delta D_{O_2} = Q \\cdot (\\alpha_{O_2} \\cdot P_{aO_2,2} - \\alpha_{O_2} \\cdot P_{aO_2,1}) = Q \\cdot \\alpha_{O_2} \\cdot (P_{aO_2,2} - P_{aO_2,1})$$\nThis shows that when hemoglobin is fully saturated, the change in oxygen delivery is determined solely by the change in the dissolved oxygen component.\n\nWe must ensure consistent units for calculation. The pump flow $Q$ is given in $\\mathrm{L/min}$ and $C_{aO_2}$ is in $\\mathrm{mL/dL}$.

This volume is the sum of the patient's plasma volume, $V_{\\mathrm{plasma}}$, and the CPB circuit priming volume, $V_{\\mathrm{circ}} = 1800 \\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n$$V_{\\mathrm{D}} = V_{\\mathrm{plasma}} + V_{\\mathrm{circ}}$$\nThe patient's total blood volume, $V_{\\mathrm{blood}}$, is calculated from the patient's mass, $m = 90 \\,\\mathrm{kg}$, and the specific blood volume of $70 \\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{blood}} = m \\times 70 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{kg}} = 90 \\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 70 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{kg}} = 6300 \\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nThe plasma volume is found by accounting for the hematocrit, $\\mathrm{Hct} = 0.38$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{plasma}} = V_{\\mathrm{blood}} \\times (1 - \\mathrm{Hct}) = 6300 \\,\\mathrm{mL} \\times (1 - 0.38) = 6300 \\,\\mathrm{mL} \\times 0.62 = 3906 \\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nThe total distribution volume is therefore:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{D}} = 3906 \\,\\mathrm{mL} + 1800 \\,\\mathrm{mL} = 5706 \\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThe third step is to calculate the required initial bolus dose, $D_{\\mathrm{bolus}}$. The total amount of heparin, $A_{\\mathrm{system}}$, required within the volume of distribution to achieve the target concentration is given by:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{system}} = C_{\\mathrm{target}} \\times V_{\\mathrm{D}} = 4.0 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{IU}}{\\mathrm{mL}} \\times 5706 \\,\\mathrm{mL} = 22824 \\,\\mathrm{IU}$$\nThis amount represents the bioavailable fraction of the administered bolus.

The administered dose, $D_{\\mathrm{bolus}}$, must be larger to compensate for this loss:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{bolus}} \\times (1 - f) = A_{\\mathrm{system}}$$\n$$D_{\\mathrm{bolus}} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{system}}}{1 - f} = \\frac{22824 \\,\\mathrm{IU}}{1 - 0.10} = \\frac{22824 \\,\\mathrm{IU}}{0.90} \\approx 25360 \\,\\mathrm{IU}$$\nRounding this result to three significant figures as requested gives $25400 \\,\\mathrm{IU}$, which in scientific notation is $2.54 \\times 10^4 \\,\\mathrm{IU}$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Maintenance Infusion Rate**\n\nTo maintain the target concentration $C_{\\mathrm{target}}$ at steady state, the rate of drug administration must balance the rate of drug elimination. The elimination rate is the product of heparin clearance, $\\mathrm{CL}$, and the target concentration. The required maintenance infusion rate, $R_{\\mathrm{maint}}$, is therefore:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{maint}} = \\mathrm{CL} \\times C_{\\mathrm{target}}$$\nThe given clearance is $\\mathrm{CL} = 0.70 \\,\\mathrm{L/hr}$, and the target concentration is $C_{\\mathrm{target}} = 4.0 \\,\\mathrm{IU/mL}$. To ensure unit consistency, we convert the clearance to $\\mathrm{mL/hr}$:\n$$\\mathrm{CL} = 0.70 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{hr}} \\times 1000 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{L}} = 700 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{hr}}$$\nNow, we calculate the maintenance infusion rate:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{maint}} = 700 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{hr}} \\times 4.0 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{IU}}{\\mathrm{mL}} = 2800 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{IU}}{\\mathrm{hr}}$$\nRounding this result to three significant figures gives $2.80 \\times 10^3 \\,\\mathrm{IU/hr}$.\n\nThe final answers for the initial bolus and maintenance infusion rate are $2.54 \\times 10^4 \\,\\mathrm{IU}$ and $2.80 \\times 10^3 \\,\\mathrm{IU/hr}$, respectively.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2.54 \\times 10^{4} & 2.80 \\times 10^{3} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5093202"}]}
