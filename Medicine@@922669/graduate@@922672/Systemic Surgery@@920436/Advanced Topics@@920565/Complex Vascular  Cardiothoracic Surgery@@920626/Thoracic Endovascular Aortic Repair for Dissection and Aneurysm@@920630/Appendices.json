It presents a standard bioengineering calculation relevant to cardiovascular device selection, followed by a request for a qualitative explanation based on established biomechanical principles. All necessary data and definitions are provided.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the effective diameter of the elliptical aortic lumen based on the principle of equal-area replacement. The givens are the minor axis diameter, $d_{minor} = 28.0$ mm, and the major axis diameter, $d_{major} = 32.0$ mm.\n\nThe semi-major axis, $a$, and semi-minor axis, $b$, are half of their respective major and minor axis diameters:\n$$a = \\frac{d_{major}}{2} = \\frac{32.0 \\, \\text{mm}}{2} = 16.0 \\, \\text{mm}$$\n$$b = \\frac{d_{minor}}{2} = \\frac{28.0 \\, \\text{mm}}{2} = 14.0 \\, \\text{mm}$$\n\nThe area of the elliptical lumen, $A_{ellipse}$, is given by the formula $A = \\pi a b$. Substituting the semi-axis values:\n$$A_{ellipse} = \\pi (16.0 \\, \\text{mm})(14.0 \\, \\text{mm}) = 224\\pi \\, \\text{mm}^2$$\n\nThis area is equated to the area of a circle, $A_{circle} = \\pi R_{aorta}^2$, where $R_{aorta}$ is the radius of the equivalent circular aorta. This value represents the radius of a circle that has the same cross-sectional area as the elliptical lumen.\n$$A_{circle} = A_{ellipse}$$\n$$\\pi R_{aorta}^2 = 224\\pi \\, \\text{mm}^2$$\nDividing both sides by $\\pi$ gives:\n$$R_{aorta}^2 = 224 \\, \\text{mm}^2$$\nThe equivalent radius is therefore:\n$$R_{aorta} = \\sqrt{224} \\, \\text{mm}$$\nThe effective diameter of the aortic landing zone, $D_{aorta}$, is twice the radius:\n$$D_{aorta} = 2 R_{aorta} = 2\\sqrt{224} \\, \\text{mm}$$\nTo simplify the radical, we find the largest perfect square factor of $224$: $224 = 16 \\times 14$.\n$$D_{aorta} = 2\\sqrt{16 \\times 14} \\, \\text{mm} = 2(4\\sqrt{14}) \\, \\text{mm} = 8\\sqrt{14} \\, \\text{mm}$$\nNumerically, $D_{aorta} \\approx 29.93325...$ mm.\n\nNext, we compute the oversizing. The nominal diameter of the selected stent-graft is given as $D_{stent} = 34.0$ mm. Oversizing is defined as the relative diameter difference between the stent-graft and the target aorta:\n$$\\text{Oversizing} = \\frac{D_{stent} - D_{aorta}}{D_{aorta}}$$\nSubstituting the values for $D_{stent}$ and $D_{aorta}$:\n$$\\text{Oversizing} = \\frac{34.0 - 8\\sqrt{14}}{8\\sqrt{14}}$$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$$\\text{Oversizing} = \\frac{34.0}{8\\sqrt{14}} - 1 = \\frac{17}{4\\sqrt{14}} - 1$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\text{Oversizing} \\approx \\frac{17}{4 \\times 3.741657} - 1 \\approx \\frac{17}{14.966629} - 1 \\approx 1.135865 - 1 = 0.135865$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final result to four significant figures.\n$$\\text{Oversizing} \\approx 0.1359$$\n\nThe second part of the problem requires a justification for why target oversizing ranges differ between degenerative thoracic aortic aneurysm and acute Stanford type B aortic dissection, using Laplace's law.\n\nLaplace's law for a thin-walled cylinder approximates the circumferential wall stress, $\\sigma_{\\theta}$, as:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{Pr}{t}$$\nwhere $P$ is the internal (blood) pressure, $r$ is the vessel radius, and $t$ is the wall thickness. When a stent-graft with a diameter larger than the native aorta is implanted, it exerts an outward radial force, increasing the aortic radius $r$ to match its own. This expansion induces tension in the aortic wall, which is quantified by the wall stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$. A secure seal between the graft and the aortic wall depends on this radial force. However, excessive radial force can lead to iatrogenic injury.\n\nIn the case of a **degenerative thoracic aortic aneurysm**, the aortic wall is chronically diseased, often thickened and fibrotic, but it is structurally intact (not torn). The primary goal of TEVAR is to achieve a durable seal in the proximal and distal landing zones to exclude the aneurysm sac from circulation and prevent endoleaks (particularly type I, at the attachment sites). A moderate degree of oversizing (e.g., $15\\% - 25\\%$) is generally desired. This generates a substantial radial force, ensuring a robust and stable seal against the aortic wall, which can withstand hemodynamic forces over the long term and prevent graft migration. The risk of iatrogenic rupture is present but lower than in an acute dissection because the wall, although weak, is not acutely torn. The main priority is **seal reliability**.\n\nIn contrast, for an **acute Stanford type B aortic dissection**, the pathology is fundamentally different. There is an active tear in the inner layer (intima) of the aorta, allowing blood to enter and cleave the layers of the aortic wall, creating a false lumen. The tissue, particularly the intimal flap separating the true and false lumens, is exceedingly fragile. The goal of TEVAR here is to cover the entry tear, redirecting flow into the true lumen and promoting thrombosis and healing of the false lumen. According to Laplace's law, a large oversizing would significantly increase the radius $r$ and thus the circumferential stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ on an already acutely injured and delicate aortic wall. This high stress poses a severe risk of iatrogenic injury, such as creating a new tear, extending the dissection proximally into the arch (a catastrophic retrograde type A dissection), or causing an outright rupture of the thinned outer wall. Therefore, a much more conservative oversizing strategy (e.g., $5\\% - 15\\%$, or even less) is employed. The main priority shifts from maximizing seal force to **minimizing the risk of iatrogenic injury**. The radial force needs to be just sufficient to appose the graft and cover the tear without causing further damage to the fragile aortic structure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.1359}$$", "id": "5193469"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the basic principles of oversizing, this exercise [@problem_id:5193454] introduces the common anatomical challenge of aortic taper, where the aorta narrows along its length.
