It is self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution proceeds by applying the given principles to the data.\n\n1.  **Calculate Single-Kidney GFRs:**\n    The total GFR is given as $GFR_{total} = 100 \\, \\text{mL/min}$. The contribution of each kidney is determined by its split function.\n    Let $GFR_{left}$ be the GFR of the left kidney and $GFR_{right}$ be the GFR of the right kidney.\n\n    The GFR for the left kidney is:\n    $$GFR_{left} = GFR_{total} \\times S_{left} = 100 \\, \\text{mL/min} \\times 45\\% = 100 \\times 0.45 \\, \\text{mL/min} = 45 \\, \\text{mL/min}$$\n\n    The GFR for the right kidney is:\n    $$GFR_{right} = GFR_{total} \\times S_{right} = 100 \\, \\text{mL/min} \\times 55\\% = 100 \\times 0.55 \\, \\text{mL/min} = 55 \\, \\text{mL/min}$$\n\n2.  **Determine Which Kidney to Procure:**\n    The third principle states that, for donor safety, the kidney with lower function is typically procured. This maximizes the donor's retained renal function.\n    Comparing the single-kidney GFRs:\n    $$GFR_{left} = 45 \\, \\text{mL/min}$$\n    $$GFR_{right} = 55 \\, \\text{mL/min}$$\n    Since $45  55$, the left kidney has the lower function.\n\n    The anatomical finding of two left renal arteries might increase the complexity of the recipient's operation (the anastomosis), but Assumption (i) explicitly states that this is considered acceptable by the transplant team. Assumption (ii) states there is no differential risk to the donor. Therefore, the functional consideration is the decisive factor. The ethically and surgically appropriate kidney to procure is the left kidney.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Immediate Post-Donation Donor GFR:**\n    If the left kidney is procured, the donor retains the right kidney.\n    The second principle states that the immediate post-donation GFR is approximated by the preoperative single-kidney GFR of the retained kidney, as immediate compensatory hyperfiltration is neglected (Assumption iii).\n\n    Therefore, the expected immediate post-donation donor GFR is equal to the GFR of the retained right kidney:\n    $$GFR_{post-donation} = GFR_{right} = 55 \\, \\text{mL/min}$$\n\n4.  **Format the Final Answer:**\n    The problem requires the final answer to be reported as a single number rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $55$.

The patient's presentation, lab values, and imaging findings are consistent with known pathophysiological states. For example, the constellation of hypotension, tachycardia, low CVP, low urine sodium, low FeNa, and concentrated urine is the classic presentation of a prerenal state due to hypovolemia.\n- **Well-Posed**: The question asks for the most likely mechanism and corresponding management based on a comprehensive set of provided data. The data are sufficient and consistent, allowing for a logical deduction of a single primary cause by exclusion of other possibilities.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using objective clinical and laboratory data. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The data are internally consistent. The clinical signs of hypovolemia (hypotension, tachycardia, low CVP) are corroborated by laboratory evidence of a prerenal state (avid sodium and water retention by the tubules). The positive response to a fluid bolus further confirms this diagnosis. The imaging and immunological data effectively rule out other major causes of early graft failure. The problem is not underspecified or overconstrained.\n- **Realism**: The scenario is highly realistic. Intravascular volume depletion is a common cause of early oliguria after kidney transplantation, often due to third-spacing of fluids, insensible losses, and a period of NPO (nil per os) status. The ischemia times are acceptable, and the surgical technique is standard.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, internally consistent, well-posed, and provides sufficient objective data to arrive at a reasoned conclusion. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Solution\nThe problem requires an analysis based on renal perfusion, glomerular filtration, tubular function, and collecting system pressure.\n\n1.  **Renal Perfusion Pressure (RPP)**: RPP is the primary determinant of blood flow to the kidney. It is approximated by the difference between Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) and renal venous pressure (which is close to CVP).\n    The patient's initial MAP is approximately $(2 \\times 50 + 85) / 3 \\approx 61.7 \\, \\text{mmHg}$. This is a low perfusion pressure. The CVP of $4 \\, \\text{cmH}_2\\text{O}$ (approximately $3\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$) is also low, indicating a low central filling pressure. The combination of hypotension, tachycardia ($110 \\, \\text{beats/min}$), and low CVP is the classic triad of hypovolemia. Reduced RPP directly leads to a decrease in renal blood flow (RBF) and, consequently, glomerular filtration rate (GFR).\n\n2.  **Glomerular Filtration (Starling Forces)**: GFR is determined by the net filtration pressure across the glomerular capillaries, as described by the Starling equation: $GFR = K_f \\times [ (P_{GC} - P_{BS}) - \\sigma(\\pi_{GC} - \\pi_{BS}) ]$. The key variable affected by systemic hypotension is the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure ($P_{GC}$). A low MAP leads to a low $P_{GC}$, which reduces the primary driving force for filtration. This results in a drop in GFR, manifesting clinically as oliguria or anuria.\n\n3.  **Tubular Reabsorptive Function**: The body's response to perceived hypovolemia (low effective arterial blood volume) involves the activation of neurohormonal systems, primarily the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) and Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH).\n    - **RAAS activation** promotes vasoconstriction (via Angiotensin II) and enhances sodium and water reabsorption in the proximal and distal tubules (via Angiotensin II and Aldosterone).\n    - **ADH release** increases water reabsorption in the collecting ducts.\n    The patient's laboratory results are direct evidence of intact and highly active tubular function consistent with this response:\n    - **Low Urine Sodium ($12 \\, \\text{mEq/L}$)** and **low FeNa ($0.6\\%$)**: Indicate avid sodium reabsorption by functional tubules. An $\\text{FeNa}  1\\%$ is the hallmark of a prerenal state.\n    - **High Urine Osmolality ($620 \\, \\text{mOsm/kg}$)** and **high Specific Gravity ($1.025$)**: Indicate a concentrated urine, reflecting aggressive water reabsorption mediated by ADH.\n    - **Low FeUrea ($25\\%$)**: In patients who may have received diuretics or in whom sodium handling is complex, FeUrea can be a useful adjunct. An $\\text{FeUrea}  35\\%$ is also strongly suggestive of a prerenal state.\n    - **Absence of granular casts**: The absence of \"muddy brown\" granular casts argues against significant acute tubular necrosis (ATN).\n\n4.  **Hydrostatic Back-Pressure**: An obstruction in the urinary collecting system (e.g., ureter, bladder) would increase pressure downstream, which would be transmitted backward to the renal pelvis, tubules, and ultimately Bowman's space. This increases Bowman's space hydrostatic pressure ($P_{BS}$), opposing glomerular filtration and causing a \"postrenal\" acute kidney injury. The finding of **no hydronephrosis** on the Doppler ultrasound definitively rules out a significant obstruction. The non-distended bladder rules out bladder outlet obstruction.\n\n**Synthesis**: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and low CVP point to intravascular volume depletion. This leads to low renal perfusion pressure and reduced GFR. The kidney's physiological response is characterized by intact, hyperactive tubules avidly conserving salt and water, which is confirmed by the highly characteristic \"prerenal\" urine indices. The swift improvement in hemodynamics and urine output following a fluid bolus confirms both the diagnosis of prerenal hypoperfusion and the efficacy of volume repletion.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Prerenal hypoperfusion due to intravascular volume depletion; administer guided intravascular volume expansion and hemodynamic support.**\n- **Analysis**: This option aligns perfectly with the synthesis of all available data. The clinical signs (hypotension, tachycardia, low CVP), laboratory findings (low FeNa, high urine osmolality), and positive response to a fluid challenge all converge on the diagnosis of prerenal acute kidney injury secondary to hypovolemia. The proposed management, guided volume expansion, is the correct and definitive treatment.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Intrarenal ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from prolonged ischemia; administer high-dose loop diuretics to convert oliguric to non-oliguric kidney injury.**\n- **Analysis**: This diagnosis is contradicted by the evidence. The ischemia times were not excessively prolonged for a living donor transplant. Most importantly, the urine indices (FeNa $0.6\\%$, UOsm $620\\ \\mathrm{mOsm/kg}$) are the opposite of what is seen in established ATN (typically $\\text{FeNa} > 2\\%$, isosthenuria with $\\text{Uosm} \\approx 300 \\, \\text{mOsm/kg}$). The normal resistive index (RI $0.60$) on ultrasound also argues against severe parenchymal injury like ATN. Administering loop diuretics to a hypotensive, hypovolemic patient would be dangerous, worsening the hypovolemia and further reducing renal perfusion.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Hyperacute antibody-mediated rejection from preformed donor-specific antibodies; initiate emergent plasmapheresis and pulse corticosteroids.**\n- **Analysis**: This is extremely unlikely. The patient had a $0\\%$ donor-specific antibody screen, making hyperacute rejection (a type II hypersensitivity reaction) almost impossible. Clinically, it presents as a catastrophic event in the operating room with a thrombosed, cyanotic graft, which did not occur. The benign physical exam and patent vessels on ultrasound rule this out.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Postrenal obstruction at the ureteroneocystostomy due to ureteral kinking; place an emergent ureteral stent or perform surgical revision.**\n- **Analysis**: While a potential surgical complication, it is definitively excluded by the renal ultrasound, which demonstrated **no hydronephrosis**.
