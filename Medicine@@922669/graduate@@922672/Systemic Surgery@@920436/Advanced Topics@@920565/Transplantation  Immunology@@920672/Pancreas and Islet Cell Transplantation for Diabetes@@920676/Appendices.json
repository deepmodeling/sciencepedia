The IEQ is defined as the total islet tissue volume divided by the volume of a single reference islet with a specified diameter.\n\nFirst, let us establish the necessary formulas. The volume $V$ of a perfect sphere is given by the formula:\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$$\nwhere $r$ is the radius of the sphere. Since the diameter $d$ is given as $d = 2r$, we can express the volume in terms of the diameter:\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\frac{d^3}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}d^3$$\n\nThe clinical definition of IEQ is given as:\n$$IEQ = \\frac{V_{\\text{total}}}{V_{\\text{ref}}}$$\nwhere $V_{\\text{total}}$ is the total volume of all islets in the batch and $V_{\\text{ref}}$ is the volume of a single reference islet.\n\nThe reference islet has a diameter of $d_{\\text{ref}} = 150\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. Its volume is:\n$$V_{\\text{ref}} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}d_{\\text{ref}}^3 = \\frac{\\pi}{6}(150\\,\\mu\\text{m})^3$$\n\nThe total volume of the islet batch, $V_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the volumes of all islets. The batch contains three populations of islets:\n1. $N_1 = 2000$ islets with diameter $d_1 = 100\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n2. $N_2 = 1000$ islets with diameter $d_2 = 150\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n3. $N_3 = 500$ islets with diameter $d_3 = 200\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nThe total volume is calculated as:\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = N_1 V_1 + N_2 V_2 + N_3 V_3$$\nSubstituting the volume formula for each population:\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = N_1 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}d_1^3\\right) + N_2 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}d_2^3\\right) + N_3 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}d_3^3\\right)$$\nWe can factor out the common term $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$:\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\left( N_1 d_1^3 + N_2 d_2^3 + N_3 d_3^3 \\right)$$\n\nNow, we can compute the total IEQ by substituting the expressions for $V_{\\text{total}}$ and $V_{\\text{ref}}$ into the IEQ definition:\n$$IEQ_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\left( N_1 d_1^3 + N_2 d_2^3 + N_3 d_3^3 \\right)}{\\frac{\\pi}{6}d_{\\text{ref}}^3}$$\nThe constant factor $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator.

This practice moves into the clinical realm, focusing on the therapeutic drug monitoring of tacrolimus, a cornerstone immunosuppressant.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of pharmacokinetics, specifically the one-compartment model for drug disposition. The provided data are internally consistent and plausible for the drug tacrolimus in a post-transplant setting. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe task is to first derive the formula for the steady-state trough concentration ($C_{ss,trough}$) and then use it to calculate a new dose ($D_{new}$) to achieve a target trough concentration.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Steady-State Trough Concentration**\n\nThe problem assumes a one-compartment model with first-order elimination and treats each oral dose as an instantaneous input. The fundamental principle is mass balance. The rate of change of the amount of drug, $A$, in the body is equal to the rate of elimination, which is proportional to the amount present.\n\nThe differential equation describing this process is:\n$$ \\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -k_e A(t) $$\nwhere $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\nSolving this differential equation by separation of variables gives the amount of drug at time $t$ after an initial amount $A_0$:\n$$ A(t) = A_0 \\exp(-k_e t) $$\nFor an oral dose of magnitude $D$ with an oral bioavailability of $F$, the amount of drug that enters the systemic circulation is $F D$. As absorption is assumed to be instantaneous, this corresponds to the initial amount in the compartment, $A_0 = F D$.\n\nThe concentration in the body, $C(t)$, is the amount $A(t)$ divided by the apparent volume of distribution, $V_d$:\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{A(t)}{V_d} = \\frac{F D}{V_d} \\exp(-k_e t) $$\nThis equation describes the concentration profile after a single dose.\n\nFor a multiple-dosing regimen where a dose $D$ is given every $\\tau$ hours, we use the principle of superposition. At steady state, the concentration profile is cyclic. The trough concentration, $C_{ss,trough}$, is the concentration just before a dose is administered. The peak concentration, $C_{ss,peak}$, is the concentration immediately after the dose.\n\nThe relationship between trough and peak concentrations at steady state is:\n1. The trough concentration is the peak concentration from the previous dose decayed over one dosing interval, $\\tau$:\n$$ C_{ss,trough} = C_{ss,peak} \\exp(-k_e \\tau) $$\n2. The peak concentration is the trough concentration plus the instantaneous increase in concentration from the new dose:\n$$ C_{ss,peak} = C_{ss,trough} + \\frac{F D}{V_d} $$\n\nTo find the trough concentration, we substitute the second equation into the first:\n$$ C_{ss,trough} = \\left( C_{ss,trough} + \\frac{F D}{V_d} \\right) \\exp(-k_e \\tau) $$\nNow, we solve for $C_{ss,trough}$:\n$$ C_{ss,trough} = C_{ss,trough} \\exp(-k_e \\tau) + \\frac{F D}{V_d} \\exp(-k_e \\tau) $$\n$$ C_{ss,trough} - C_{ss,trough} \\exp(-k_e \\tau) = \\frac{F D}{V_d} \\exp(-k_e \\tau) $$\n$$ C_{ss,trough} (1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)) = \\frac{F D}{V_d} \\exp(-k_e \\tau) $$\n$$ C_{ss,trough} = \\frac{F D}{V_d} \\frac{\\exp(-k_e \\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)} $$\nThis is the derived expression for the steady-state trough concentration. It can be expressed in terms of systemic clearance, $CL = k_e V_d$, and apparent oral clearance, $CL/F$. Substituting $V_d = CL/k_e$:\n$$ C_{ss,trough} = \\frac{F D}{(CL/k_e)} \\frac{\\exp(-k_e \\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)} = \\frac{F D k_e}{CL} \\frac{\\exp(-k_e \\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)} $$\nRearranging for $CL/F$:\n$$ C_{ss,trough} = \\frac{D k_e}{CL/F} \\frac{\\exp(-k_e \\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)} $$\n\n**2. Calculation of the New Dose**\n\nThe derived relationship shows that for a given patient (constant $F$, $V_d$, $k_e$) and a fixed dosing interval $\\tau$, the steady-state trough concentration is directly proportional to the dose $D$. However, the problem provides Bayesian-updated estimates for the patient's pharmacokinetic parameters, which represent the most reliable information. We will use these parameters to calculate the required dose.\n\nWe rearrange the derived formula to solve for the dose, $D$:\n$$ D = C_{ss,trough} \\left( \\frac{CL}{F} \\right) \\frac{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)}{k_e \\exp(-k_e \\tau)} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the elimination rate constant $k_e$ from the given half-life, $t_{1/2} = 12\\,\\mathrm{h}$:\n$$ k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{12\\,\\mathrm{h}} $$\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Target trough concentration, $C_{ss,trough,target} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$.\n- Apparent oral clearance, $CL/F = 18.6\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$.\n- Dosing interval, $\\tau = 12\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\nThe product $k_e \\tau$ is:\n$$ k_e \\tau = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{12\\,\\mathrm{h}} \\times 12\\,\\mathrm{h} = \\ln(2) $$\n\nNow we can compute the term involving the exponential functions:\n$$ \\frac{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)}{k_e \\exp(-k_e \\tau)} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\ln(2))}{\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{12\\,\\mathrm{h}}\\right) \\exp(-\\ln(2))} = \\frac{1 - 1/2}{\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{12\\,\\mathrm{h}}\\right) (1/2)} = \\frac{1/2}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{24\\,\\mathrm{h}}} = \\frac{12\\,\\mathrm{h}}{\\ln(2)} $$\n\nNow, substitute this back into the equation for the new dose, $D_{new}$:\n$$ D_{new} = C_{ss,trough,target} \\times \\left( \\frac{CL}{F} \\right) \\times \\frac{12\\,\\mathrm{h}}{\\ln(2)} $$\n\nWe must ensure units are consistent. The concentration is in $\\mathrm{ng/mL}$ and clearance is in $\\mathrm{L/h}$. We convert $\\mathrm{ng/mL}$ to $\\mathrm{ng/L}$:\n$C_{ss,trough,target} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL} = 10.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{ng/L}$.\n\n$$ D_{new} = (10.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{ng/L}) \\times (18.6\\,\\mathrm{L/h}) \\times \\frac{12\\,\\mathrm{h}}{\\ln(2)} $$\n$$ D_{new} = \\frac{10.0 \\times 10^3 \\times 18.6 \\times 12}{\\ln(2)} \\,\\mathrm{ng} $$\n$$ D_{new} = \\frac{2,232,000}{\\ln(2)} \\,\\mathrm{ng} $$\nUsing $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$:\n$$ D_{new} \\approx \\frac{2,232,000}{0.693147} \\,\\mathrm{ng} \\approx 3,220,162\\,\\mathrm{ng} $$\n\nThe result is required in milligrams ($\\mathrm{mg}$):\n$$ D_{new} \\approx 3.220162\\,\\mathrm{mg} $$\n\nRounding to three significant figures, as instructed:\n$$ D_{new} \\approx 3.22\\,\\mathrm{mg} $$\nThis dose of $3.22\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ every $12$ hours is predicted by the model to achieve the target trough concentration of $10.0\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$.\n\nA check via proportionality using the measured concentration $C_{ss,trough,current} = 6.2\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$ with the current dose $D_{current} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ yields $D_{new} = D_{current} \\times (C_{target}/C_{current}) = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\times (10.0/6.2) \\approx 3.2258\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, which rounds to $3.23\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.

The stated willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold is $\\$100,000$ per QALY. Since the calculated ICER is less than the WTP threshold ($96,610  100,000$), the SPK strategy is considered acceptable, or \"cost-effective\", under this decision rule. It provides additional health benefits (QALYs) at a cost per unit of benefit that is below the maximum acceptable price.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{96610}\n$$", "id": "5161650"}]}
