Under saturating antibody conditions, the measured MFI for a given antigen class is proportional to the number of accessible epitopes, consistent with the law of mass action and standard fluorescence detection principles. Three independent xenoantigen loci—α-1,3-galactosyltransferase (*GGTA1*), cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (*CMAH*), and β-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase 2 (*B4GALNT2*)—are targeted for deletion.

It is based on standard principles of flow cytometry and molecular biology related to xenotransplantation. All necessary data are provided, the constraints are consistent, and the terminology is precise.

The reductions are independent and multiplicative. Therefore, the total reduction factor for deleting all three loci is $f^{N}$.\n\nThe residual specific MFI after deleting all three loci, which we will denote as $MFI_{specific, KO}$ (for knockout), is calculated by applying this total reduction factor to the initial specific MFI:\n$$MFI_{specific, KO} = MFI_{specific, WT} \\times f^{N}$$\nWe have $MFI_{specific, WT} = 1.50 \\times 10^{5}$, $f = 0.50$, and $N = 3$.\n$$MFI_{specific, KO} = (1.50 \\times 10^{5}) \\times (0.50)^{3}$$\nFirst, calculate the reduction factor:\n$$(0.50)^{3} = 0.5 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.125$$\nNow, multiply this by the initial specific MFI:\n$$MFI_{specific, KO} = (1.50 \\times 10^{5}) \\times 0.125$$\n$$MFI_{specific, KO} = 0.1875 \\times 10^{5}$$\nTo express this in standard scientific notation, we adjust the mantissa and exponent:\n$$MFI_{specific, KO} = 1.875 \\times 10^{4} \\text{ RFU}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
