The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\n**1.  Endocrine Diagnosis:**\n    - **Primary Aldosteronism:** The patient presents with hypertension and hypokalemia ($2.8$ $\\text{mmol/L}$) with metabolic alkalosis (bicarbonate $31$ $\\text{mmol/L}$). The hormonal workup confirms this diagnosis with a high plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) of $32$ $\\text{ng/dL}$ and a suppressed plasma renin activity (PRA) of $0.08$ $\\text{ng/mL/h}$. The aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) is $PAC/PRA = 32 / 0.08 = 400$, which is markedly elevated (typically a cutoff of $>20-30$ is used) and diagnostic of primary aldosteronism.\n    - **Autonomous Cortisol Secretion (Subclinical Cushing's Syndrome):** The $1$ $\\text{mg}$ overnight dexamethasone suppression test is abnormal, with a post-suppression cortisol of $7.0$ $\\mu\\text{g/dL}$ (failure to suppress below a threshold like $1.8$ $\\mu\\text{g/dL}$). This, combined with a suppressed ACTH level ($<5$ $\\text{pg/mL}$), indicates an adrenal source of autonomous cortisol production. The absence of overt cushingoid stigmata and only borderline elevated $24$-hour UFC categorizes this as subclinical Cushing's syndrome.\n    - **Androgen Co-secretion:** The DHEA-S level of $450$ $\\mu\\text{g/dL}$ is elevated, indicating co-secretion of adrenal androgens.\n    - **Exclusion of Pheochromocytoma:** Normal plasma metanephrines rule out a catecholamine-secreting tumor.\n    - **Conclusion:** The patient has a single adrenal tumor co-secreting aldosterone, cortisol, and androgens.\n\n**2.  Radiological Diagnosis and Staging:**\n    - **Diagnosis:** A large ($7.8$ $\\text{cm}$) adrenal mass with multiple concerning features (high unenhanced attenuation of $35$ $\\text{HU}$ [adenomas are typically $<10$ $\\text{HU}$], irregular margins, heterogeneity, delayed washout) is highly suspicious for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). The co-secretion of multiple hormone classes further strengthens this suspicion.\n    - **Staging (ENSAT):**\n        - **T Stage:** The tumor is $>5$ $\\text{cm}$. The CT finding of \"stranding of periadrenal fat\" indicates infiltration into periadrenal tissues. According to the provided ENSAT criteria, this constitutes a $T3$ lesion. It is not $T2$ because it is not confined to the adrenal gland. It is not $T4$ because there is no invasion of adjacent organs.\n        - **N Stage:** \"no definable regional lymphadenopathy\" corresponds to a clinical stage of $N0$.\n        - **M Stage:** \"no distant metastases\" corresponds to $M0$.\n        - **Overall Stage:** The combination $T3N0M0$ is classified as ENSAT Stage III.\n\n**3.  Management Plan:**\n    - **Preoperative Preparation:**\n        - **Hyperaldosteronism:** The patient's severe hypertension and hypokalemia must be controlled to optimize them for surgery. This requires potassium supplementation and medical blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor with an agent like spironolactone or eplerenone.\n        - **Hypercortisolism:** Due to autonomous cortisol secretion from the tumor, the patient's HPA axis is suppressed (low ACTH). Removal of the tumor will precipitate acute adrenal insufficiency. Therefore, perioperative (and postoperative) stress-dose glucocorticoid coverage is mandatory.\n    - **Surgical Procedure:**\n        - The high suspicion of ACC based on size, imaging features, and hormonal co-secretion contraindicates a laparoscopic approach. The standard of care is an **open en bloc adrenalectomy** to ensure complete tumor removal without rupture and to achieve negative surgical margins ($R0$).\n        - As per oncologic principles for ACC, a **regional lymphadenectomy** should be performed for accurate staging and potentially improved local control, even in the absence of radiologically enlarged nodes.\n    - **Adjuvant Therapy:** Given the diagnosis of a Stage III ACC, which is a high-risk feature, adjuvant therapy should be considered post-operatively. The standard agent is **mitotane**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Primary aldosterone-producing adrenocortical carcinoma with autonomous cortisol co-secretion; ENSAT $T3N0M0$ ($\\text{Stage III}$); proceed with open en bloc adrenalectomy with regional lymphadenectomy, preoperative mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism and potassium repletion, and perioperative stress-dose glucocorticoids; consider adjuvant mitotane based on high-risk features.**\n- **Diagnosis & Hormonal Profile:** Correct. The tumor is an ACC that produces aldosterone and cortisol.\n- **Staging:** Correct. The tumor size and fat stranding make it $T3$. $N0$ and $M0$ are given. $T3N0M0$ is ENSAT Stage III.\n- **Management:** Correct. The surgical approach (open en bloc with lymphadenectomy), preoperative medical management (MRA, potassium), perioperative steroid coverage, and consideration of adjuvant mitotane are all appropriate and align with the derived plan.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma confined to the gland; laparoscopic adrenalectomy is appropriate; no perioperative glucocorticoid coverage is needed; postoperative surveillance without adjuvant therapy.**\n- **Diagnosis:** Incorrect. The tumor's size ($7.8$ $\\text{cm}$), malignant imaging features, and multi-hormonal secretion are inconsistent with a benign adenoma.\n- **Management:** Incorrect. Laparoscopy is contraindicated. Perioperative glucocorticoids are essential. Adjuvant therapy should be considered for ACC.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Cortisol-producing adrenocortical carcinoma causing secondary renin suppression and low aldosterone; ENSAT $T2N0M0$ ($\\text{Stage II}$); open adrenalectomy without lymphadenectomy; perioperative alpha blockade is not required.**\n- **Diagnosis:** Incorrect. The primary driver of the clinical syndrome is primary aldosteronism, with a high PAC of $32$ $\\text{ng/dL}$, not low aldosterone.\n- **Staging:** Incorrect. The tumor is $T3$ due to periadrenal fat stranding, not $T2$. The stage is III, not II.\n- **Management:** Incorrect. A regional lymphadenectomy is a key component of an oncologic resection for ACC.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia causing primary aldosteronism; initiate medical therapy with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and avoid surgery; no need for cortisol-directed perioperative management.**\n- **Diagnosis:** Incorrect. Imaging shows a large, unilateral right adrenal mass, not bilateral hyperplasia.\n- **Management:** Incorrect. A unilateral mass causing primary aldosteronism, especially one suspicious for malignancy, is an indication for surgery, not medical therapy alone.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Pheochromocytoma of the right adrenal causing catecholamine-driven hypertension and hypokalemia; initiate alpha blockade and plan laparoscopic adrenal-sparing resection; ENSAT staging does not apply.**\n- **Diagnosis:** Incorrect. The problem explicitly states that plasma metanephrines are normal, definitively ruling out pheochromocytoma.\n- **Management:** Incorrect. Alpha blockade is not indicated. A laparoscopic or adrenal-sparing resection would be inappropriate for a suspected $7.8$ $\\text{cm}$ ACC.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nThe only option that correctly synthesizes all aspects of the case is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5081996"}]}
