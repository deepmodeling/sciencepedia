A solution will be generated.\n\nThe derivation of the expression for the Standard Error of Measurement ($\\operatorname{SEM}$) in terms of the observed standard deviation $s$ and reliability $r$ proceeds as follows.\n\nWe are given the additive decomposition of variance for the observed score $X$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\operatorname{Var}(T) + \\operatorname{Var}(E)\n$$\nWe are also given the definition of reliability, $r$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(T)}{\\operatorname{Var}(X)}\n$$\nFrom this definition, we can express the true score variance, $\\operatorname{Var}(T)$, in terms of reliability $r$ and the observed score variance $\\operatorname{Var}(X)$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(T) = r \\cdot \\operatorname{Var}(X)\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\operatorname{Var}(T)$ into the variance decomposition equation:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(X) = (r \\cdot \\operatorname{Var}(X)) + \\operatorname{Var}(E)\n$$\nOur goal is to find an expression for $\\operatorname{SEM} = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(E)}$. First, we solve the above equation for the error variance, $\\operatorname{Var}(E)$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(E) = \\operatorname{Var}(X) - r \\cdot \\operatorname{Var}(X)\n$$\nFactoring out $\\operatorname{Var}(X)$ from the right-hand side gives:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(E) = \\operatorname{Var}(X) (1 - r)\n$$\nBy definition, the Standard Error of Measurement ($\\operatorname{SEM}$) is the standard deviation of the error term:\n$$\n\\operatorname{SEM} = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(E)}\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\operatorname{Var}(E)$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{SEM} = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(X)(1 - r)}\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{SEM} = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(X)} \\sqrt{1 - r}\n$$\nThe problem defines the observed standard deviation as $s$. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, so $s = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(X)}$. Substituting $s$ into the equation yields the desired expression for $\\operatorname{SEM}$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{SEM} = s \\sqrt{1 - r}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for $\\operatorname{SEM}$ given an observed standard deviation $s = 10$ scale points and a reliability $r = 0.85$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\operatorname{SEM} = 10 \\sqrt{1 - 0.85}\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{SEM} = 10 \\sqrt{0.15}\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{SEM} \\approx 10 \\times 0.38729833...\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{SEM} \\approx 3.8729833...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $3$, $8$, $7$, and $2$.

In the context of value-based surgical care, a key objective is to determine if a surgical intervention has led to a meaningful improvement in a patient's functional status, as measured by a Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) scale. The $\\operatorname{SEM}$ quantifies the amount of random measurement error inherent in any single score obtained from that scale. It represents the standard deviation of scores an individual would be expected to obtain if they were to take the test repeatedly with no actual change in their true functional status ($T$).\n\nTherefore, the $\\operatorname{SEM}$ establishes a 'band of uncertainty' around a patient's observed score. When tracking a patient's progress between two time points (e.g., pre-surgery and post-surgery), any observed change in score must be evaluated against this inherent measurement error. A change that is small relative to the $\\operatorname{SEM}$ is likely to be just random noise or fluctuation, rather than a genuine change in the patient's underlying condition. To have confidence that a true change has occurred, the observed difference in scores must be substantially larger than the $\\operatorname{SEM}$. The $\\operatorname{SEM}$ is the fundamental building block for calculating indices like the \"Minimal Detectable Change\" (MDC), which defines the smallest change in score that can be considered real and not attributable to measurement error. In this specific case, with an $\\operatorname{SEM}$ of $3.873$ points, a surgical program would recognize that an observed score change for a patient of, for instance, $2$ points is well within the margin of error and cannot be confidently interpreted as true functional recovery.

Qualitative Comment on the Discounting Effect**\n\nThe undiscounted QALYs are calculated to be $0.73750$, while the discounted QALYs are $0.72576$. The absolute reduction due to discounting is $0.73750 - 0.72576 = 0.01174$ QALYs. The relative reduction is $\\frac{0.01174}{0.73750} \\times 100\\% \\approx 1.59\\%$.\n\nIn the context of value-based surgical care, a reduction of approximately $1.6\\%$ over a one-year time horizon is relatively small. For interventions where both costs and health outcomes are concentrated within a single year, the application of a standard discount rate like $3\\%$ has a minimal impact on the outcome of a cost-effectiveness analysis. The choice of whether to discount effects within the first year is itself a matter of debate among health economists, but when applied as per the standard formula, the effect is modest.\n\nHowever, the importance of discounting becomes pronounced for surgical interventions or treatments with long-term consequences, such as joint replacements or cancer therapies, where benefits (or harms) accrue over decades. In those cases, the cumulative effect of a $3\\%$ annual discount rate significantly diminishes the value of future health gains, thereby heavily influencing which interventions are deemed \"cost-effective.\" The principle of discounting inherently prioritizes present health benefits over future ones, a normative stance that is critical to acknowledge in long-term value assessments.
