Prior to imaging, they synthesize history, examination, and time-from-onset to estimate a pretest probability of torsion of $0.40$. A Color Doppler Ultrasound (CDUS) is obtained. From high-quality meta-analysis, the CDUS test characteristics for torsion in this context are a sensitivity of $0.90$ and a specificity of $0.95$. The scan is negative (no reduced intratesticular arterial flow and no whirlpool sign).

This is a direct application of Bayes' theorem. We begin by formally defining the events and probabilities.\n\nLet $T$ be the event that the patient has testicular torsion.\nLet $T^c$ be the event that the patient does not have testicular torsion.\nLet $CDUS^+$ be the event that the CDUS test result is positive.\nLet $CDUS^-$ be the event that the CDUS test result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following information:\nThe pretest probability of torsion is $P(T) = 0.40$.\nFrom this, the pretest probability of not having torsion is $P(T^c) = 1 - P(T) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$.\n\nThe test characteristics are given as:\nThe sensitivity of the CDUS, which is the probability of a positive test given that the disease is present:\n$$\n\\text{Sensitivity} = P(CDUS^+ | T) = 0.90\n$$\nThe specificity of the CDUS, which is the probability of a negative test given that the disease is absent:\n$$\n\\text{Specificity} = P(CDUS^- | T^c) = 0.95\n$$\n\nWe are asked to find the post-test probability of torsion given a negative CDUS result, which is the conditional probability $P(T | CDUS^-)$.\n\nAccording to the definition of conditional probability, also known as Bayes' theorem, we have:\n$$\nP(T | CDUS^-) = \\frac{P(T \\cap CDUS^-)}{P(CDUS^-)}\n$$\nThe numerator can be re-written using the definition of conditional probability $P(CDUS^- | T) = \\frac{P(T \\cap CDUS^-)}{P(T)}$, which gives $P(T \\cap CDUS^-) = P(CDUS^- | T) \\cdot P(T)$.\n$$\nP(T | CDUS^-) = \\frac{P(CDUS^- | T) \\cdot P(T)}{P(CDUS^-)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(CDUS^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test result. It can be expanded using the law of total probability, which sums the probabilities of a negative test over all possible disease states (torsion or no torsion):\n$$\nP(CDUS^-) = P(CDUS^- | T) \\cdot P(T) + P(CDUS^- | T^c) \\cdot P(T^c)\n$$\nSubstituting this expansion into the Bayes' theorem expression, we get the full formula for the post-test probability:\n$$\nP(T | CDUS^-) = \\frac{P(CDUS^- | T) \\cdot P(T)}{P(CDUS^- | T) \\cdot P(T) + P(CDUS^- | T^c) \\cdot P(T^c)}\n$$\nNow, we must express all terms in this formula using the given information. We have:\n- $P(T) = 0.40$ (given pretest probability).\n- $P(T^c) = 1 - P(T) = 0.60$.\n- $P(CDUS^- | T^c)$ is the specificity, given as $0.95$.\n- $P(CDUS^- | T)$ is the probability of a negative test given the presence of torsion. This is the complement of the sensitivity. For a patient with torsion, the test can only be positive or negative, so $P(CDUS^+ | T) + P(CDUS^- | T) = 1$. This probability $P(CDUS^- | T)$ is also known as the false negative rate (FNR).\n$$\nP(CDUS^- | T) = 1 - P(CDUS^+ | T) = 1 - \\text{Sensitivity} = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10\n$$\nNow we can substitute all these numerical values into the formula:\n$$\nP(T | CDUS^-) = \\frac{(0.10) \\cdot (0.40)}{(0.10) \\cdot (0.40) + (0.95) \\cdot (0.60)}\n$$\nWe compute the numerator and the denominator separately.\nNumerator:\n$$\n(0.10) \\cdot (0.40) = 0.04\n$$\nDenominator:\n$$\n(0.10) \\cdot (0.40) + (0.95) \\cdot (0.60) = 0.04 + 0.57 = 0.61\n$$\nThus, the post-test probability is:\n$$\nP(T | CDUS^-) = \\frac{0.04}{0.61}\n$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we can write the decimals as fractions and simplify:\n$$\nP(T | CDUS^-) = \\frac{4/100}{61/100} = \\frac{4}{61}\n$$\nAs a decimal rounded to four significant figures, the value is $4 \\div 61 \\approx 0.0655737...$, which rounds to $0.06557$.

Strategy A is immediate scrotal exploration upon arrival. Strategy B is a diagnostic pathway that uses Color Doppler Ultrasonography (CDU) prior to exploration. Use the following scientifically grounded assumptions and core definitions to construct a quantitative decision model and compute the requested quantity.\n\nFundamental definitions and well-tested facts:\n- Sensitivity and specificity are defined as follows: sensitivity is the probability of a positive test given disease is present, and specificity is the probability of a negative test given disease is absent. Let sensitivity be denoted by $\\text{se}$ and specificity by $\\text{sp}$.\n- The pretest probability (prevalence) of true testicular torsion among patients with clinical suspicion is denoted $p_{T}$.\n- Let $t_{0}$ denote the time from pain onset to presentation.
