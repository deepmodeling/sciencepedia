A quantitative solution can be derived from the provided information and standard geometric principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to calculate the fraction of renal parenchymal volume preserved following a partial nephrectomy. This fraction, which we denote as $F$, is the ratio of the volume remaining after surgery to the initial volume of the kidney.\n\nA radical nephrectomy, by definition, involves the removal of the entire kidney, resulting in a preserved volume of $0$ and a preservation fraction of $0$. A partial, or nephron-sparing, nephrectomy aims to remove only the tumor and a safety margin of healthy tissue, preserving the rest of the kidney. The preserved volume, $V_{\\text{preserved}}$, is the preoperative ipsilateral renal volume, $V_{\\text{kidney}}$, minus the resected volume, $V_{\\text{resection}}$.\n\nThe fraction of preserved volume is therefore:\n$$\nF = \\frac{V_{\\text{preserved}}}{V_{\\text{kidney}}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{kidney}} - V_{\\text{resection}}}{V_{\\text{kidney}}} = 1 - \\frac{V_{\\text{resection}}}{V_{\\text{kidney}}}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that both the kidney and the resected tissue mass can be modeled as ellipsoids. The volume $V$ of an ellipsoid with semi-axes $a$, $b$, and $c$ is given by the standard formula:\n$$\nV = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a b c\n$$\nFirst, we determine the volume of the kidney, $V_{\\text{kidney}}$. The diameters are given as $d_{k1} = 11.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, $d_{k2} = 6.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, and $d_{k3} = 4.4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. The corresponding semi-axes are half these values:\n- $a_k = \\frac{d_{k1}}{2} = \\frac{11.2}{2} = 5.6\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- $b_k = \\frac{d_{k2}}{2} = \\frac{6.0}{2} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- $c_k = \\frac{d_{k3}}{2} = \\frac{4.4}{2} = 2.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n\nThe volume of the kidney is:\n$$\nV_{\\text{kidney}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a_k b_k c_k = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (5.6)(3.0)(2.2)\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the volume of the resected tissue, $V_{\\text{resection}}$. According to assumption (ii), this volume is an ellipsoid formed by the tumor plus a uniform parenchymal margin of $m = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. We first find the semi-axes of the tumor from its given diameters $d_{t1} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, $d_{t2} = 2.4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, and $d_{t3} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$:\n- $a_t = \\frac{d_{t1}}{2} = \\frac{3.0}{2} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- $b_t = \\frac{d_{t2}}{2} = \\frac{2.4}{2} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- $c_t = \\frac{d_{t3}}{2} = \\frac{2.0}{2} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n\nThe semi-axes of the resection ellipsoid, $a_r, b_r, c_r$, are found by adding the margin $m$ to each tumor semi-axis:\n- $a_r = a_t + m = 1.5 + 0.5 = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- $b_r = b_t + m = 1.2 + 0.5 = 1.7\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- $c_r = c_t + m = 1.0 + 0.5 = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n\nThe volume of the resected tissue is:\n$$\nV_{\\text{resection}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a_r b_r c_r = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (2.0)(1.7)(1.5)\n$$\n\nNow we can compute the fraction $F$. The constant factor $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ appears in both the numerator and the denominator and thus cancels:\n$$\nF = 1 - \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi a_r b_r c_r}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi a_k b_k c_k} = 1 - \\frac{a_r b_r c_r}{a_k b_k c_k}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for the semi-axes:\n$$\nF = 1 - \\frac{(2.0)(1.7)(1.5)}{(5.6)(3.0)(2.2)}\n$$\nWe calculate the products in the numerator and the denominator:\n- Numerator: $a_r b_r c_r = 2.0 \\times 1.7 \\times 1.5 = 5.1$\n- Denominator: $a_k b_k c_k = 5.6 \\times 3.0 \\times 2.2 = 36.96$\n\nThe fraction of volume resected is:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text{resection}}}{V_{\\text{kidney}}} = \\frac{5.1}{36.96} \\approx 0.137987013...\n$$\nThe fraction of volume preserved is:\n$$\nF = 1 - \\frac{5.1}{36.96} \\approx 1 - 0.137987013... = 0.862012986...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $1$, so we round down.\n$$\nF \\approx 0.8620\n$$\nThis result quantifies the substantial benefit of nephron-sparing surgery in this case, preserving approximately $86.2\\%$ of the kidney's volume, in stark contrast to the $0\\%$ preservation from a radical nephrectomy.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.8620}\n$$", "id": "5179261"}, {"introduction": "While preserving parenchyma is the goal, the primary risk during partial nephrectomy is warm ischemic injury from vascular clamping.

Total Expected Utility Functions $U_{\\mathrm{PN}}(w)$ and $U_{\\mathrm{RN}}(w)$\nThe total utility is given by $U = w\\,u_{\\mathrm{ren}} + (1-w)\\,u_{\\mathrm{onc}}$. By the linearity of expectation, the total expected utility for a given choice is $E[U] = w\\,E[u_{\\mathrm{ren}}] + (1-w)\\,E[u_{\\mathrm{onc}}]$.\n\n**Total Expected Utility for PN ($U_{\\mathrm{PN}}(w)$):**\nWe substitute the expected utilities for PN into the general formula:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{PN}}(w) = w\\,E[u_{\\mathrm{ren, PN}}] + (1-w)\\,E[u_{\\mathrm{onc, PN}}]$$\n$$U_{\\mathrm{PN}}(w) = w(0.9727) + (1-w)(0.9800)$$\n$$U_{\\mathrm{PN}}(w) = 0.9727w + 0.9800 - 0.9800w$$\n$$U_{\\mathrm{PN}}(w) = 0.9800 - 0.0073w$$\n\n**Total Expected Utility for RN ($U_{\\mathrm{RN}}(w)$):**\nWe substitute the expected utilities for RN into the general formula:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{RN}}(w) = w\\,E[u_{\\mathrm{ren, RN}}] + (1-w)\\,E[u_{\\mathrm{onc, RN}}]$$\n$$U_{\\mathrm{RN}}(w) = w(0.9454) + (1-w)(0.9925)$$\n$$U_{\\mathrm{RN}}(w) = 0.9454w + 0.9925 - 0.9925w$$\n$$U_{\\mathrm{RN}}(w) = 0.9925 - 0.0471w$$\n\nThese are the explicit linear functions of $w$.\n\n#### 3. Indifference Weight $w^{\\star}$\nThe indifference weight $w^{\\star}$ is the value of $w$ at which a patient would be indifferent between the two options, meaning their total expected utilities are equal: $U_{\\mathrm{PN}}(w^{\\star}) = U_{\\mathrm{RN}}(w^{\\star})$.\n\nFirst, we derive the explicit symbolic expression for $w^{\\star}$:\n$$w^{\\star}E[u_{\\mathrm{ren, PN}}] + (1-w^{\\star})E[u_{\\mathrm{onc, PN}}] = w^{\\star}E[u_{\\mathrm{ren, RN}}] + (1-w^{\\star})E[u_{\\mathrm{onc, RN}}]$$\n$$w^{\\star}E[u_{\\mathrm{ren, PN}}] + E[u_{\\mathrm{onc, PN}}] - w^{\\star}E[u_{\\mathrm{onc, PN}}] = w^{\\star}E[u_{\\mathrm{ren, RN}}] + E[u_{\\mathrm{onc, RN}}] - w^{\\star}E[u_{\\mathrm{onc, RN}}]$$\nGathering terms with $w^{\\star}$ on one side and constant terms on the other:\n$$w^{\\star}(E[u_{\\mathrm{ren, PN}}] - E[u_{\\mathrm{onc, PN}}] - E[u_{\\mathrm{ren, RN}}] + E[u_{\\mathrm{onc, RN}}]) = E[u_{\\mathrm{onc, RN}}] - E[u_{\\mathrm{onc, PN}}]$$\n$$w^{\\star} = \\frac{E[u_{\\mathrm{onc, RN}}] - E[u_{\\mathrm{onc, PN}}]}{(E[u_{\\mathrm{ren, PN}}] - E[u_{\\mathrm{ren, RN}}]) + (E[u_{\\mathrm{onc, RN}}] - E[u_{\\mathrm{onc, PN}}])}$$\nThis is the general expression for the indifference weight.\n\nNow, we evaluate $w^{\\star}$ numerically by setting the linear functions equal:\n$$0.9800 - 0.0073w^{\\star} = 0.9925 - 0.0471w^{\\star}$$\n$$0.0471w^{\\star} - 0.0073w^{\\star} = 0.9925 - 0.9800$$\n$$0.0398w^{\\star} = 0.0125$$\n$$w^{\\star} = \\frac{0.0125}{0.0398} \\approx 0.31407035...$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $w^{\\star} = 0.3141$. This means a patient who assigns a weight of approximately $31.4\\%$ to renal function utility (and consequently $68.6\\%$ to oncologic utility) would be indifferent between Partial and Radical Nephrectomy based on this model. For $w > w^{\\star}$, PN is preferred; for $w < w^{\\star}$, RN is preferred.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.3141}$$", "id": "5179367"}]}
