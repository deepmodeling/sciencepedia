The RMI and its application are verifiable through peer-reviewed medical literature.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe problem requires the definition, calculation, and interpretation of the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI). The solution will proceed in three parts as requested.\n\n**1) Definition of the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI)**\n\nThe Risk of Malignancy Index (version I) is founded on the principle that the contributions of independent risk factors can be combined in a multiplicative fashion. The index is a composite score derived from three components: an ultrasound morphology score ($U$), a menopausal status score ($M$), and the serum Cancer Antigen 125 ($CA125$) level.\n\nThe formula for the RMI is:\n$$\nRMI = U \\times M \\times CA125\n$$\nThe components are defined and scored as follows:\n\n- **Ultrasound Score ($U$):** This score is based on the presence of specific sonographic features associated with malignancy. One point is assigned for each of the following five features:\n    - Multilocular cyst\n    - Presence of solid areas\n    - Evidence of metastases (e.g., peritoneal nodules, liver deposits)\n    - Presence of ascites\n    - Bilateral lesions\nThe total number of points determines the score $U$:\n    - $U = 0$ if no malignant features are present.\n    - $U = 1$ if one malignant feature is present.\n    - $U = 3$ if two or more malignant features are present.\n\n- **Menopausal Status Score ($M$):** This score reflects the higher baseline risk of ovarian cancer in postmenopausal women. Menopausal status is typically defined as having had no menses for more than $1$ year or being over age $50$ in women who have had a hysterectomy.\n    - $M = 1$ for premenopausal status.\n    - $M = 3$ for postmenopausal status.\n\n- **Serum $CA125$ Concentration ($CA125$):** This is the patient's measured serum $CA125$ level, taken as a continuous variable and expressed in international units per milliliter ($\\mathrm{U/mL}$).\n\n**2) Calculation of the Patient's RMI**\n\nThe patient-specific data provided are:\n- Ultrasound Score: $U = 3$ (indicating two or more malignant features were found).\n- Menopausal Status Score: $M = 3$ (indicating postmenopausal status).\n- Serum $CA125$ Concentration: $CA125 = 600\\,\\mathrm{U/mL}$.\n\nThe RMI is calculated by substituting these values into the defined formula:\n$$\nRMI = U \\times M \\times CA125\n$$\n$$\nRMI = 3 \\times 3 \\times 600\n$$\n$$\nRMI = 9 \\times 600\n$$\n$$\nRMI = 5400\n$$\nThe resulting Risk of Malignancy Index for this patient is $5400$. This is a unitless scalar value.\n\n**3) Clinical Interpretation and Surgical Guidance**\n\nThe magnitude of the RMI is used to stratify patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk groups for ovarian malignancy, thereby guiding clinical management. The problem specifies a conventional high-risk triage threshold on the order of $200$ to $250$.\n\nThe calculated RMI of $5400$ is substantially greater than this high-risk threshold ($5400 \\gg 250$). Such a high value indicates a very strong likelihood of an underlying epithelial ovarian malignancy. This information is critical for surgical planning and patient triage. A low RMI might support a more conservative surgical approach by a general gynecologist, possibly with preservation of fertility. However, a high RMI mandates referral to a subspecialist gynecologic oncologist and preparation for a major oncologic operation.\n\nThe high RMI value signals that a simple diagnostic laparoscopy or cystectomy is inappropriate, as it would likely lead to incomplete staging and tumor spillage, worsening the patient's prognosis. Instead, the surgical team must be prepared to perform a comprehensive surgical procedure. The two primary options are:\n- **Comprehensive Surgical Staging:** This is performed if the disease appears confined to the ovaries on preoperative imaging and intraoperative assessment. It is a systematic operation to definitively determine the extent of cancer spread, involving procedures such as total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, lymph node dissection, and peritoneal biopsies.\n- **Primary Cytoreductive (Debulking) Surgery:** This is performed for advanced-stage disease where cancer has visibly spread into the pelvis or abdomen. The goal is to resect all macroscopic tumor implants, as the amount of residual disease post-surgery is a primary prognostic factor.\n\nTherefore, an RMI of $5400$ serves as a critical alert. It prioritizes the patient for surgery by a gynecologic oncologist at a tertiary care center equipped to handle complex cancer surgery. The surgical plan would explicitly not be for a limited procedure, but rather for a full staging or cytoreductive operation, contingent on the findings from preoperative imaging (e.g., CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis) and the intraoperative assessment of disease extent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5400}$$", "id": "5128593"}, {"introduction": "Surgical staging is not complete until the pathology has been meticulously analyzed.

The given definitions are:\n1. ITCs ($pN0(i+)$): $d \\le 0.2\\\\,\\\\mathrm{mm}$\n2. Micrometastases ($pN1mi$): $0.2  d \\le 2\\\\,\\\\mathrm{mm}$\n3.

All of these values satisfy the condition $d \\le 0.2\\\\,\\\\mathrm{mm}$. Therefore, all $7$ patients in Group A are classified as having ITCs, or $pN0(i+)$.\n- **Group B patients**: The deposit sizes are $0.21, 0.30, 0.40, 0.60, 0.75, 1.20, 1.40, 1.99, 2.00$. All of these values satisfy the condition $0.2  d \\le 2\\\\,\\\\mathrm{mm}$. Therefore, all $9$ patients in Group B are classified as having micrometastases, or $pN1mi$.\n- **Group C patients**: The deposit sizes are $2.10, 2.20, 2.50, 3.00, 3.30, 4.20, 5.10, 6.00$. All of these values satisfy the condition $d > 2\\\\,\\\\mathrm{mm}$.
