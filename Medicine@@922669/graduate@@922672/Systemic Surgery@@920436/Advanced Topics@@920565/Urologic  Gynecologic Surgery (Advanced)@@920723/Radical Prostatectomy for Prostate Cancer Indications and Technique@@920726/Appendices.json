The following preoperative data are available: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is $9.2$ ng/mL, biopsy Grade Group $2$ (Gleason score $3+4$), clinical stage cT2a on digital rectal examination and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, and a systematic biopsy with $12$ cores total and $4$ cores positive. There is no radiographic evidence of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, or nodal disease. Using widely accepted risk stratification definitions for localized prostate cancer (for example, the D'Amico classification and its subdivisions used by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)), and guideline-based indications for pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) grounded in the European Association of Urology (EAU) recommendation to perform PLND when the estimated probability of lymph node invasion is at least $0.05$ according to validated preoperative nomograms, determine whether radical prostatectomy (RP) alone is indicated and whether PLND should be added.\n\nStart from the foundational definitions:\n- Low risk is characterized by PSA $10$ ng/mL, Grade Group $1$, and clinical stage T1–T2a.\n- Intermediate risk is characterized by any one of PSA $10–20$ ng/mL, Grade Group $2$ to $3$, or clinical stage T2b–T2c.\n- High risk includes PSA $> 20$ ng/mL, Grade Group $4$ to $5$, or clinical stage $\\ge$ T3.\n\nSubdivide intermediate risk:\n- Favorable intermediate risk is defined by exactly one intermediate-risk factor, Grade Group $1$ to $2$, and biopsy involvement of at most $50\\%$ of cores.\n- Unfavorable intermediate risk includes Grade Group $3$ (Gleason $4+3$), multiple intermediate-risk factors, or biopsy involvement exceeding $50\\%$ of cores.\n\nUse the following decision codification:\n- Let $D_{\\mathrm{RP}}=1$ if RP alone is indicated as the definitive local therapy, $D_{\\mathrm{RP}}=2$ if RP with PLND is indicated, and $D_{\\mathrm{RP}}=0$ if RP is not indicated as a primary management strategy.\n- Let $D_{\\mathrm{PLND}}=1$ if PLND should be added, and $D_{\\mathrm{PLND}}=0$ otherwise.\n\nCompute the risk category from the given data using the above definitions, assess whether RP alone is indicated, and whether PLND should be added in light of the EAU threshold of $0.05$ for predicted lymph node invasion risk in intermediate-risk disease. Express your final decision vector as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}D_{\\mathrm{RP}}  D_{\\mathrm{PLND}}\\end{pmatrix}$. No units are required in the final answer. If any intermediate numerical quantity requires approximation, round to four significant figures; however, the final coded decision values must be exact integers.", "solution": "The problem requires a determination of the appropriate surgical management for a patient with clinically localized prostate cancer based on provided preoperative data and a specific set of risk stratification rules. The decision must be encoded into a vector $\\begin{pmatrix}D_{\\mathrm{RP}}  D_{\\mathrm{PLND}}\\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\nThe problem provides a comprehensive set of givens:\n- Patient data: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of $9.2$ ng/mL, biopsy Grade Group $2$ (Gleason score $3+4$), clinical stage cT2a, and $4$ out of $12$ biopsy cores positive for cancer.\n- Imaging findings: No radiographic signs of advanced disease (extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, or nodal disease).\n- Definitions for risk stratification: A three-tiered system (Low, Intermediate, High) and a two-tiered subdivision for intermediate risk (Favorable, Unfavorable).\n- Guideline for pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND): PLND is indicated if the probability of lymph node invasion (LNI) is $\\ge 0.05$.\n- Codification for the final decision: A set of integer codes for $D_{\\mathrm{RP}}$ and $D_{\\mathrm{PLND}}$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is based on established, real-world clinical guidelines from urologic oncology (NCCN, EAU). The required information to proceed with a logical deduction is provided, assuming the standard clinical correlation that the provided risk stratification categories serve as a proxy for lymph node invasion risk. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution by systematically applying the given rules.\n\nStep 1: Determine the patient's overall risk category.\nThe problem defines risk categories based on PSA, Grade Group (GG), and clinical stage (T stage). We compare the patient's data to the criteria for each risk group.\n\n- PSA criterion: The patient's PSA is $9.2$ ng/mL. This value satisfies the Low risk criterion (PSA $ 10$ ng/mL).\n- Grade Group criterion: The patient's Grade Group is $2$. This value satisfies the Intermediate risk criterion (GG $2$ to $3$).\n- Clinical Stage criterion: The patient's stage is cT2a. This value satisfies the Low risk criterion (Stage T1–T2a).\n\nA patient is assigned to the highest risk category for which they meet at least one criterion. Since the patient has one intermediate-risk factor (Grade Group $2$) and no high-risk factors, the patient is classified as having **Intermediate Risk** prostate cancer.\n\nStep 2: Sub-stratify the Intermediate Risk category.\nThe problem provides definitions to distinguish between Favorable Intermediate Risk (FIR) and Unfavorable Intermediate Risk (UIR).\n\n- **Favorable Intermediate Risk (FIR)** criteria:\n    1.  Exactly one intermediate-risk factor: The patient has only one intermediate-risk factor (Grade Group $2$). This criterion is met.\n    2.  Grade Group $1$ to $2$: The patient's Grade Group is $2$. This criterion is met.\n    3.  Biopsy involvement of at most $50\\%$ of cores: The patient has $4$ positive cores out of a total of $12$. The percentage of positive cores is $\\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.3333$, which is $33.33\\%$. This is less than or equal to the $50\\%$ threshold. This criterion is met.\n\nSince the patient's profile fulfills all three conditions for FIR, he is classified as having **Favorable Intermediate Risk** disease.\n\nStep 3: Determine the indication for Radical Prostatectomy (RP).\nRadical prostatectomy is a standard primary definitive therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer, especially for patients with intermediate-risk disease who have a sufficient life expectancy (typically $>10$ years). As the problem presents a localized disease scenario and asks for the appropriate surgical management, RP is considered an indicated treatment option. Thus, the decision variable $D_{\\mathrm{RP}}$ cannot be $0$. The value will be either $1$ (RP alone) or $2$ (RP with PLND), depending on the PLND decision.\n\nStep 4: Determine the indication for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection (PLND).\nThe indication for PLND is based on the EAU guideline provided: perform PLND if the estimated probability of lymph node invasion, $P(\\mathrm{LNI})$, is at least $0.05$. While a specific nomogram formula is not provided, the detailed risk stratification serves as a surrogate for this risk assessment. It is a well-established principle in urologic oncology that patients with Favorable Intermediate Risk disease, as defined in this problem, have a very low probability of LNI, which consistently falls below the $5\\%$ threshold when calculated using standard validated nomograms (e.g., Briganti, MSKCC). The FIR classification implies that $P(\\mathrm{LNI})  0.05$.\nTherefore, based on the problem's criteria, PLND should not be performed. This leads to the decision $D_{\\mathrm{PLND}} = 0$.\n\nStep 5: Synthesize the final decision vector.\nWe concluded that RP is an indicated therapy and that PLND is not. This corresponds to the selection of \"RP alone\".\n- The code for RP alone is $D_{\\mathrm{RP}} = 1$.\n- The code for not adding PLND is $D_{\\mathrm{PLND}} = 0$.\n\nThe final decision vector is $\\begin{pmatrix}D_{\\mathrm{RP}}  D_{\\mathrm{PLND}}\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}1  0\\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}1  0\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5177764"}, {"introduction": "Surgical excellence extends beyond technical skill to encompass sound intraoperative judgment, especially when faced with conflicting objectives.

During apical dissection, the surgeon obtains apical shavings and sends them for Frozen Section (FS) analysis to assess the urethral/apical margin.\n\nAssume the following are well-established, context-appropriate foundational facts for surgical decision-making:\n\n- A tumor at the inked surgical margin is associated with increased risk of local recurrence and need for adjuvant or salvage therapy; aiming for a negative margin is an oncologic objective.\n- FS analysis has test characteristics summarized by sensitivity and specificity that determine how much a positive or negative result changes the probability of a true positive margin.\n- Widening the apical resection (taking additional urethra/apex) reduces the chance of a residual positive apical margin but increases the risk of postoperative urinary incontinence by compromising the external urinary sphincter and shortening urethral length.\n\nFor this patient, based on preoperative risk stratification and intraoperative appearance, the prior probability of a truly positive apical margin before FS is estimated at $p_0 = 0.25$. The FS test characteristics for apical shavings at your institution are sensitivity $S_e = 0.80$ and specificity $S_p = 0.95$. The FS report returns “positive for carcinoma at or within the inked apical margin” (i.e., FS is positive). If the apical margin is truly positive, performing an additional $5$ $\\text{mm}$ apical/urethral resection converts the margin to negative with probability $q = 0.90$. The absolute increase in long-term incontinence risk attributable to this additional apical resection is $\\Delta I = 0.20$.\n\nAssume the surgeon values avoiding a positive apical margin and avoiding incontinence equally in expected disutility terms; that is, the disutility of ending the case with a positive apical margin is set to $1.0$, and the disutility of increasing incontinence risk by an absolute probability of $\\Delta I$ is numerically equal to $\\Delta I$. Based on these parameters and fundamental decision principles, which of the following intraoperative management choices is most appropriate?\n\nA. Widen the apical resection now, because the FS-positive result implies a sufficiently high posterior probability of a true positive margin that outweighs the expected continence harm given the stated utility weights.\n\nB.

The question is unambiguous.\n- **Objective (Critical):** The problem is stated in precise, objective clinical and mathematical terms. The utility assignments, though simplified, are explicitly defined, removing subjectivity from the analytical process.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a sound and solvable problem in medical decision analysis. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe core task is to determine the optimal course of action (widen resection vs. do not widen) by comparing the expected disutility of each choice, given the positive Frozen Section (FS) result.\n\nLet $M+$ denote the event that the apical margin is truly positive, and $M-$ denote the event that it is truly negative.\nLet $FS+$ denote a positive FS result, and $FS-$ denote a negative FS result.\n\nThe provided a priori probability of a positive margin is $P(M+) = p_0 = 0.25$.\nConsequently, the prior probability of a negative margin is $P(M-) = 1 - p_0 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n\nThe FS test characteristics are given as:\n- Sensitivity: $S_e = P(FS+ | M+) = 0.80$\n- Specificity: $S_p = P(FS- | M-) = 0.95$\n\nFrom specificity, we can derive the false positive rate:\n$P(FS+ | M-) = 1 - S_p = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nThe surgeon has received a positive FS result ($FS+$). We must first update the probability of a true positive margin using Bayes' theorem. This updated probability is the posterior probability, which is the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) for this specific clinical context.\nThe posterior probability of a true positive margin, $P(M+ | FS+)$, is:\n$$ P(M+ | FS+) = \\frac{P(FS+ | M+) P(M+)}{P(FS+)} $$\nThe total probability of a positive FS result, $P(FS+)$, is given by the law of total probability:\n$$ P(FS+) = P(FS+ | M+) P(M+) + P(FS+ | M-) P(M-) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ P(FS+) = (0.80)(0.25) + (0.05)(0.75) $$\n$$ P(FS+) = 0.20 + 0.0375 = 0.2375 $$\nNow we can calculate the posterior probability of a true positive margin:\n$$ P(M+ | FS+) = \\frac{0.20}{0.2375} \\approx 0.842105 $$\nLet's denote this posterior probability as $p_{\\text{post}} = P(M+ | FS+) \\approx 0.8421$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the expected disutility for each of the two possible actions.\n\n**Action 1: Widen the apical resection.**\nThe disutility for this action is the sum of the disutility from the potential for a residual positive margin and the disutility from the definite harm to continence.\n- **Disutility from Continence Harm:** The additional resection increases incontinence risk by $\\Delta I = 0.20$. The disutility is given as being numerically equal to this value: $U_{\\text{incontinence}} = 0.20$.\n- **Expected Disutility from Margin Status:** A positive margin will remain only if the margin was truly positive to begin with (probability $p_{\\text{post}}$) AND the wider resection fails to clear it (probability $1-q$). The disutility of a final positive margin is $1.0$.\n$$ E[U_{\\text{margin, widen}}] = p_{\\text{post}} \\times (1-q) \\times U_{\\text{PSM}} $$\n$$ E[U_{\\text{margin, widen}}] \\approx (0.8421) \\times (1 - 0.90) \\times 1.0 = (0.8421)(0.10) = 0.08421 $$\nThe total expected disutility of widening is:\n$$ E[U_{\\text{widen}}] = U_{\\text{incontinence}} + E[U_{\\text{margin, widen}}] $$\n$$ E[U_{\\text{widen}}] \\approx 0.20 + 0.08421 = 0.28421 $$\n\n**Action 2: Do not widen the apical resection.**\nFor this action, there is no additional harm to continence ($\\Delta I = 0$, so $U_{\\text{incontinence}} = 0$). The disutility is solely from the risk of leaving a positive margin. The probability of leaving a positive margin is simply the posterior probability that the margin is truly positive, $p_{\\text{post}}$.\n$$ E[U_{\\text{not widen}}] = p_{\\text{post}} \\times U_{\\text{PSM}} $$\n$$ E[U_{\\text{not widen}}] \\approx 0.8421 \\times 1.0 = 0.8421 $$\n\n**Decision:**\nWe compare the expected disutilities:\n- $E[U_{\\text{widen}}] \\approx 0.28421$\n- $E[U_{\\text{not widen}}] \\approx 0.8421$\n\nSince $E[U_{\\text{widen}}]  E[U_{\\text{not widen}}]$, the action with the lower expected disutility is to widen the resection. The benefit of substantially reducing the probability of a positive margin (from $0.8421$ to $0.08421$) outweighs the disutility of the increased incontinence risk ($0.20$).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Widen the apical resection now, because the FS-positive result implies a sufficiently high posterior probability of a true positive margin that outweighs the expected continence harm given the stated utility weights.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with our analysis. The FS-positive result increased the probability of a true positive margin from $0.25$ to approximately $0.84$. Our decision-analytic calculation showed that the expected disutility of widening ($0.284$) is much lower than that of not widening ($0.842$), meaning the oncologic benefit outweighs the functional harm under the specified utility framework.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Do not widen; the FS-positive result is unreliable due to a low specificity, and the positive predictive value is less than $0.50$, so widening would cause more harm than benefit.**\nThis statement contains multiple factual errors based on the problem givens.\n1. \"low specificity\": The specificity is given as $S_p = 0.95$, which is considered high, not low. A high specificity implies a low false positive rate.\n2. \"positive predictive value is less than $0.50$\": We calculated the positive predictive value (the posterior probability $P(M+|FS+)$) to be approximately $0.84$, which is significantly greater than $0.50$.\n3. \"widening would cause more harm than benefit\": Our disutility calculation proves the opposite is true.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Widen only if nerve-sparing is not planned; if nerve-sparing is planned, defer widening to avoid functional harm regardless of the FS result.**\nThe problem defines a specific decision framework based on two utilities: margin status and urinary incontinence. It explicitly states to make the decision based on \"these parameters\". While nerve-sparing is part of the clinical context, its impact on utility is not included in the provided model. Introducing it as a decisive factor violates the problem's constraints. The decision must be made using the quantitative model given, which supports widening. This option proposes an alternative decision rule not supported by the provided data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Defer any margin-directed action and rely on final pathology; FS sensitivity of $0.80$ is too low to guide intraoperative decisions at the apex.**\nThis option claims the sensitivity of $0.80$ is \"too low\" to be useful. This is a subjective assertion that is proven false by quantitative analysis. The FS test, with $S_e=0.80$ and $S_p=0.95$, was shown to be extremely informative, increasing the estimated probability of a positive margin from a prior of $0.25$ to a posterior of $0.84$. This is a very powerful shift in probability and provides a clear basis for an intraoperative decision. The test is demonstrably useful in this context.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5177778"}, {"introduction": "The surgeon's responsibility often continues after the procedure, especially when pathology reveals high-risk features that increase the chance of recurrence.

The multidisciplinary team is deciding between adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) delivered now versus early salvage RT initiated when Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) reaches a threshold. To justify the choice using first principles, model microscopic disease and control as follows:\n\n- PSA kinetics: after surgery at time zero, PSA is $0.05$ ng/mL and grows exponentially with a PSA doubling time $T_{d}=3$ months (assume $1$ month $=30$ days). That is, $\\text{PSA}(t) = \\text{PSA}_0 \\cdot 2^{t/T_d}$.\n- Microscopic burden: the number of clonogenic tumor cells $N$ is proportional to PSA via $\\text{PSA}=c\\,N$ with proportionality constant $c=1.0\\times 10^{-9}$ ng/mL per cell (so $1$ ng/mL corresponds to $10^{9}$ cells).\n- RT regimen: either adjuvant RT now or early salvage RT when PSA first reaches $0.2$ ng/mL; both courses use $66$ Gy in $33$ fractions of $2$ Gy over $46$ days.\n- Radiobiology: use the Linear-Quadratic (LQ) model with $\\alpha/\\beta=1.5$ Gy and $\\alpha=0.15$ Gy$^{-1}$ (implying $\\beta=\\alpha/(\\alpha/\\beta)$). The surviving fraction after the full course is $S_{\\text{LQ}} = \\exp[-(\\alpha D + \\beta d D)]$. Allow exponential proliferation during RT with growth rate $g=\\ln(2)/T_{d}$, so the mean surviving clonogens after the course are multiplied by $\\exp(g\\,T_{\\text{RT}})$, with $T_{\\text{RT}}=46$ days.\n- Tumor Control Probability (TCP): assume a Poisson model where $\\text{TCP}=\\exp(-\\lambda)$ and $\\lambda$ is the mean number of surviving clonogens at the end of RT.\n\nUnder this model, which option best reflects the expected TCPs for adjuvant versus early salvage RT and correctly justifies the direction and approximate magnitude of any advantage?\n\nA. Adjuvant RT: $\\text{TCP}\\approx 0.993$; Early salvage RT: $\\text{TCP}\\approx 0.974$; an absolute control advantage of about $2\\%$ favors adjuvant RT because delaying until PSA $=0.2$ ng/mL allows approximately a $4$-fold increase in clonogens before treatment.\n\nB. Adjuvant RT: $\\text{TCP}\\approx 0.974$; Early salvage RT: $\\text{TCP}\\approx 0.993$; an absolute control advantage of about $2\\%$ favors early salvage because starting at a higher PSA increases radiosensitivity through a lower effective $\\alpha/\\beta$.\n\nC.

Adjuvant RT: $\\text{TCP}\\approx 0.993$; Early salvage RT: $\\text{TCP}\\approx 0.974$; an absolute control advantage of about $2\\%$ favors adjuvant RT because delaying until PSA $=0.2$ ng/mL allows approximately a $4$-fold increase in clonogens before treatment.\nThis option's numerical results ($\\text{TCP} \\approx 0.993$, $\\text{TCP} \\approx 0.974$, advantage $\\approx 2\\%$) perfectly match our derivation. The justification that the advantage is due to a $4$-fold increase in clonogens ($0.2/0.05 = 4$) is also correct and is the central driver of the difference in TCP in this model.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. Adjuvant RT: $\\text{TCP}\\approx 0.974$; Early salvage RT: $\\text{TCP}\\approx 0.993$; an absolute control advantage of about $2\\%$ favors early salvage because starting at a higher PSA increases radiosensitivity through a lower effective $\\alpha/\\beta$.\nThis option incorrectly swaps the TCP values for the two scenarios. Adjuvant RT, treating a smaller tumor, must have a higher TCP. The conclusion that early salvage is favored is therefore incorrect. The justification about increased radiosensitivity or a changing $\\alpha/\\beta$ ratio is not supported by the problem statement, which provides fixed radiobiological parameters.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. Adjuvant RT: $\\text{TCP}\\approx 0.973$; Early salvage RT: $\\text{TCP}\\approx 0.893$; an absolute control advantage of about $8\\%$ favors adjuvant RT because the dose is insufficient to overcome any delay.\nThe TCP values presented in this option are numerically incorrect. Our calculations yielded $\\text{TCP}_{\\text{adj}} \\approx 0.993$ and $\\text{TCP}_{\\text{salv}} \\approx 0.974$. Consequently, the claimed $8\\%$ advantage is also incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. The TCPs cannot be compared quantitatively under these assumptions because the proportionality constant $c$ between PSA and clonogen number prevents computing the mean survivors and thus the Poisson TCPs.\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The proportionality constant $c$ is precisely what *enables* the quantitative comparison by allowing the conversion of a clinical marker (PSA) into the number of clonogenic cells ($N$), which is the input for the TCP model. The calculations performed above demonstrate that the TCPs can be, and have been, computed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only option that is consistent with a rigorous derivation from the provided model is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5177724"}]}
