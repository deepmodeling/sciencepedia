In the context of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which is a therapeutic procedure with significant complication risks, you are considering whether a noninvasive Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) should be performed first to refine the probability of stones before ERCP. A validated clinical model estimates the pretest probability of choledocholithiasis as $0.70$. The MRCP diagnostic performance for choledocholithiasis in this clinical context is characterized by sensitivity $0.90$ and specificity $0.95$. The MRCP is performed and returns a positive result (a filling defect consistent with a stone).\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and Bayes’ theorem, derive the posterior probability of choledocholithiasis given the positive MRCP result and then interpret, based on core principles of ERCP indications, whether proceeding directly to ERCP is justified versus an MRCP-first strategy. Express the final posterior probability as a decimal and round your answer to four significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the posterior probability of a patient having choledocholithiasis given a positive Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) result. This is a direct application of Bayes' theorem, a fundamental principle in probability theory and statistics used for updating beliefs based on new evidence.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has choledocholithiasis (the disease is present).\nLet $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have choledocholithiasis (the complementary event).\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the MRCP test result is positive.\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the MRCP test result is negative.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement can be formalized as follows:\n1. The pre-test probability of choledocholithiasis: $P(D) = 0.70$.\n2. The sensitivity of MRCP, which is the probability of a positive test given the disease is present: $P(T^+ | D) = 0.90$.\n3. The specificity of MRCP, which is the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent: $P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95$.\n\nFrom these givens, we can derive other necessary probabilities:\n- The pre-test probability of not having the disease is the complement of having it:\n  $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30$.\n- The probability of a positive test given the disease is absent (a false positive) is the complement of the specificity:\n  $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nThe goal is to calculate the posterior probability of having the disease given a positive test result, which is denoted as $P(D | T^+)$. We will use Bayes' theorem for this calculation:\n$$ P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, represents the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, summing over all possible scenarios (patient has the disease or does not have the disease):\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\n\nNow, we substitute the known values into this formula to calculate $P(T^+)$:\n$$ P(T^+) = (0.90)(0.70) + (0.05)(0.30) $$\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.63 + 0.015 $$\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.645 $$\n\nWith the total probability of a positive test calculated, we can now compute the posterior probability $P(D | T^+)$ using Bayes' theorem. The numerator, $P(T^+ | D) P(D)$, is the probability of having the disease AND getting a positive test result, which we have already calculated as $0.63$.\n$$ P(D | T^+) = \\frac{0.63}{0.645} $$\n$$ P(D | T^+) \\approx 0.976744186... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P(D | T^+) \\approx 0.9767 $$\n\nInterpretation based on core principles of ERCP indications:\nThe initial clinical assessment provided a high pre-test probability of choledocholithiasis ($P(D) = 0.70$). According to many clinical guidelines, a pre-test probability greater than $50\\%$ may justify proceeding directly to therapeutic Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which is an invasive procedure with risks such as pancreatitis, bleeding, and perforation.\n\nIn this case, a non-invasive MRCP was performed first. The positive result of the MRCP has significantly refined the diagnostic certainty. The posterior probability of disease, calculated as approximately $0.977$, is exceptionally high. A probability of this magnitude effectively confirms the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis. This near-certainty ($95\\%$) provides a definitive indication for ERCP. The purpose of the ERCP shifts from a potentially diagnostic procedure to a purely therapeutic one, as the need for stone extraction is now established with very high confidence. The MRCP-first strategy, therefore, served to validate the necessity of the invasive procedure, ensuring that the patient is subjected to the risks of ERCP only when the benefit is almost certain.

This is described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation.\n\nThe volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is given by:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi R^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nwhere $R$ is the inner radius of the stent, $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop along the length $L$ of the stent, and $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (bile).\n\nThe problem provides the inner diameters, $d$, rather than the radii, $R$. Since $R = \\frac{d}{2}$, we can substitute this into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi (\\frac{d}{2})^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L} = \\frac{\\pi d^4 \\Delta P}{16 \\cdot 8 \\eta L} = \\frac{\\pi d^4 \\Delta P}{128 \\eta L}$$\n\nLet $Q_7$ and $Q_{10}$ be the volumetric flow rates through the $7 \\, \\mathrm{Fr}$ and $10 \\, \\mathrm{Fr}$ stents, respectively. Let their inner diameters be $d_7 = 1.9 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$ and $d_{10} = 2.5 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$. According to the problem statement, the pressure drop $\\Delta P$, length $L$, and viscosity $\\eta$ are the same for both stents.\n\nThe flow rates for the two stents are:\n$$Q_7 = \\frac{\\pi d_7^4 \\Delta P}{128 \\eta L}$$\n$$Q_{10} = \\frac{\\pi d_{10}^4 \\Delta P}{128 \\eta L}$$\n\nThe problem posits a mechanistic assumption that patency time, $T$, is directly proportional to the volumetric flow rate, $Q$. This can be expressed as:\n$$T = k Q$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality. This constant incorporates factors related to the fouling process, such as the concentration of sludge precursors and the surface properties of the stent, and is assumed to be the same for both stents.\n\nWe need to find the ratio of the patency time of the $10 \\, \\mathrm{Fr}$ stent, $T_{10}$, to that of the $7 \\, \\mathrm{Fr}$ stent, $T_7$:\n$$\\frac{T_{10}}{T_7} = \\frac{k Q_{10}}{k Q_7} = \\frac{Q_{10}}{Q_7}$$\n\nNow, we compute the ratio of the flow rates:\n$$\\frac{Q_{10}}{Q_7} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi d_{10}^4 \\Delta P}{128 \\eta L}}{\\frac{\\pi d_7^4 \\Delta P}{128 \\eta L}}$$\nThe constants $\\pi$, $\\Delta P$, $L$, $\\eta$, and the factor $128$ cancel out, leaving a simple ratio of the inner diameters raised to the fourth power:\n$$\\frac{T_{10}}{T_7} = \\frac{d_{10}^4}{d_7^4} = \\left(\\frac{d_{10}}{d_7}\\right)^4$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the inner diameters: $d_{10} = 2.5 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$ and $d_7 = 1.9 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$. The units of millimeters will cancel in the ratio.\n$$\\frac{T_{10}}{T_7} = \\left(\\frac{2.5}{1.9}\\right)^4$$\n\nCalculating the value:\n$$\\frac{2.5}{1.9} \\approx 1.315789...$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{2.5}{1.9}\\right)^4 \\approx (1.315789...)^4 \\approx 2.9974238...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

It requests the calculation of the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) based on provided clinical-epidemiological data, using first-principles definitions.\n\nThe fundamental quantities are defined as follows:\n- The risk of an event, $R$, is the probability of its occurrence.\n- The risk in the control group (no prophylaxis) is denoted as $R_c$.\n- The risk in the treatment group (receiving rectal indomethacin) is denoted as $R_t$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the baseline risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) in the high-risk population is given.
