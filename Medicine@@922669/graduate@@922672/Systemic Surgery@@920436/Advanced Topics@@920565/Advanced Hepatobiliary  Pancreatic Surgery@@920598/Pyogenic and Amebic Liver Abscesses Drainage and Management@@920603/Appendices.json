It constitutes a well-posed problem in Euclidean geometry applied to a simplified, but realistic, medical imaging scenario. The givens are self-consistent, scientifically grounded, and sufficient to determine a unique solution.\n\nThe problem can be modeled in a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. Let the skin entry point be the origin $O = (0, 0)$. As per the problem description, the skin normal is represented by the positive $y$-axis, and the medial direction corresponds to the positive $x$-axis. The units of the coordinates are centimeters (cm).\n\nThe target, the center of the pyogenic abscess, is located at a depth of $6$ cm along the skin normal and is offset $3$ cm medially. Therefore, the coordinates of the target point $T$ are $(x, y) = (3, 6)$.\n\nThe skin-to-target trajectory is the straight line segment connecting the origin $O$ to the target point $T$. This trajectory forms the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle. The legs of this triangle are the horizontal (medial) offset and the vertical depth. The lengths of the legs are $x = 3$ cm and $y = 6$ cm, respectively.\n\nFirst, we determine the trajectory length, $L$. This is the Euclidean distance from $O$ to $T$. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides:\n$$L^2 = x^2 + y^2$$\nSubstituting the given values for $x$ and $y$:\n$$L = \\sqrt{3^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 36} = \\sqrt{45}$$\nWe can simplify this expression:\n$$L = \\sqrt{9 \\times 5} = 3\\sqrt{5}$$\nTo obtain the numerical value required by the problem, we calculate the decimal expansion:\n$$L \\approx 6.7082039...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the trajectory length is:\n$$L \\approx 6.708 \\text{ cm}$$\n\nNext, we determine the in-plane angulation of the trajectory, $\\theta$. The problem specifies this angle as being relative to the skin normal (the $y$-axis) and directed medially (towards the positive $x$-axis). In the right-angled triangle we have constructed, this angle $\\theta$ is the angle at the origin $O$ between the $y$-axis and the hypotenuse $OT$.\n\nThe side adjacent to this angle $\\theta$ is the depth, $y = 6$ cm.

This is also a positive, valid dimension.\n    -   The problem setup is free of contradictions.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a valid problem. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of fluid flow through two different medical catheters, grounded in the principles of Hagen-Poiseuille flow.\n\nThe Hagen-Poiseuille equation describes the volumetric flow rate $Q$ of a Newtonian fluid in laminar flow through a long cylindrical pipe of length $L$ and internal radius $r$, under a pressure difference $\\Delta P$. The equation is:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Strong Dependence of Flow Rate on Radius**\n\nThe first objective is to explain why the volumetric flow rate $Q$ depends strongly on the catheter's internal radius $r$. From the Hagen-Poiseuille equation, we can observe the relationship between $Q$ and the various parameters. The problem states that the pressure gradient $\\Delta P$, the fluid viscosity $\\mu$, and the catheter length $L$ are constant. The values $\\pi$ and $8$ are also constants. Therefore, we can express the flow rate as being proportional to the remaining variable, the internal radius $r$:\n$$Q \\propto r^4$$\nThe volumetric flow rate is proportional to the fourth power of the internal radius. This quartic relationship signifies a very strong dependence. For example, doubling the internal radius of the tube, while keeping all other factors constant, results in an increase in the flow rate by a factor of $2^4 = 16$. This non-linear, high-power dependence is the reason that even small changes in catheter-lumen diameter have a profound impact on the efficiency of drainage.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the Flow Rate Ratio $Q_{12}/Q_{8}$**\n\nThe second objective is to compute the ratio of the volumetric flow rate for the $12$ French catheter ($Q_{12}$) to that of the $8$ French catheter ($Q_8$).\n\nLet $r_8$ and $r_{12}$ be the internal radii of the $8$ Fr and $12$ Fr catheters, respectively. The volumetric flow rates are given by:\n$$Q_8 = \\frac{\\pi r_8^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$$\n$$Q_{12} = \\frac{\\pi r_{12}^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}$$\n\nTo find the ratio $Q_{12}/Q_8$, we divide the second equation by the first:\n$$\\frac{Q_{12}}{Q_8} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi r_{12}^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}}{\\frac{\\pi r_8^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\mu L}}$$\nSince $\\pi$, $\\Delta P$, $8$, $\\mu$, and $L$ are identical for both catheters, these terms cancel out, leaving:\n$$\\frac{Q_{12}}{Q_8} = \\frac{r_{12}^4}{r_8^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_{12}}{r_8}\\right)^4$$\nThe ratio of the flow rates is equal to the fourth power of the ratio of their internal radii. The same relationship holds for the internal diameters, $D_i$:\n$$\\frac{Q_{12}}{Q_8} = \\left(\\frac{D_{i,12}/2}{D_{i,8}/2}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{D_{i,12}}{D_{i,8}}\\right)^4$$\n\nNext, we must calculate the internal diameters $D_{i,8}$ and $D_{i,12}$.\nThe outer diameter $D_o$ is given by the French gauge size multiplied by the conversion factor $0.33 \\text{ mm/Fr}$.\n\nFor the $8$ French catheter:\n$D_{o,8} = 8 \\text{ Fr} \\times 0.33 \\frac{\\text{mm}}{\\text{Fr}} = 2.64 \\text{ mm}$\n\nFor the $12$ French catheter:\n$D_{o,12} = 12 \\text{ Fr} \\times 0.33 \\frac{\\text{mm}}{\\text{Fr}} = 3.96 \\text{ mm}$\n\nThe internal diameter $D_i$ is given by the outer diameter $D_o$ minus twice the wall thickness $t = 0.50 \\text{ mm}$.\n$D_i = D_o - 2t$\n\nFor the $8$ French catheter:\n$D_{i,8} = 2.64 \\text{ mm} - 2(0.50 \\text{ mm}) = 2.64 \\text{ mm} - 1.00 \\text{ mm} = 1.64 \\text{ mm}$\n\nFor the $12$ French catheter:\n$D_{i,12} = 3.96 \\text{ mm} - 2(0.50 \\text{ mm}) = 3.96 \\text{ mm} - 1.00 \\text{ mm} = 2.96 \\text{ mm}$\n\nNow we can compute the ratio of the flow rates:\n$$\\frac{Q_{12}}{Q_8} = \\left(\\frac{D_{i,12}}{D_{i,8}}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{2.96 \\text{ mm}}{1.64 \\text{ mm}}\\right)^4$$\nThe units of millimeters cancel out, yielding a dimensionless ratio as expected.\n$$\\frac{Q_{12}}{Q_8} = \\left(\\frac{2.96}{1.64}\\right)^4 \\approx (1.804878)^4 \\approx 10.59754$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\frac{Q_{12}}{Q_8} \\approx 10.6$$\nThus, a $12$ French catheter allows for a flow rate that is approximately $10.6$ times greater than that of an $8$ French catheter under the specified conditions.

A complete, reasoned solution will now be derived.\n\nThe objective is to determine the maximum number of complete tracts, denoted by $N$, that can be infiltrated without exceeding the adjusted maximum safe dose of lidocaine for this patient.\n\nFirst, we calculate the adjusted maximum safe dose of lidocaine ($M_{\\text{adj}}$) for this patient. The standard maximum recommended dose for a patient with normal hepatic function is given as $D_{\\text{max,normal}} = 7 \\,\\text{mg/kg}$. For a patient of mass $m = 65 \\,\\text{kg}$, the total maximum dose would be:\n$$M_{\\text{normal}} = D_{\\text{max,normal}} \\times m = (7 \\,\\text{mg/kg}) \\times (65 \\,\\text{kg}) = 455 \\,\\text{mg}$$\nThe patient has moderate hepatic impairment, which necessitates a dose reduction. The specified adjustment factor is $f_{\\text{adj}} = 0.70$. Therefore, the adjusted maximum safe dose for this patient is:\n$$M_{\\text{adj}} = M_{\\text{normal}} \\times f_{\\text{adj}} = 455 \\,\\text{mg} \\times 0.70 = 318.5 \\,\\text{mg}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total mass of lidocaine administered for the infiltration of a single tract, denoted by $M_{\\text{tract}}$. The procedure for one tract involves two volumes of infiltration: $V_1 = 5 \\,\\text{mL}$ for the skin and $V_2 = 7 \\,\\text{mL}$ for the deeper tissues. The total volume of anesthetic solution used per tract is:\n$$V_{\\text{tract}} = V_1 + V_2 = 5 \\,\\text{mL} + 7 \\,\\text{mL} = 12 \\,\\text{mL}$$\nThe concentration of the $1\\%$ lidocaine solution is given as $C = 10 \\,\\text{mg/mL}$. The mass of lidocaine in the volume used for one tract is therefore:\n$$M_{\\text{tract}} = V_{\\text{tract}} \\times C = 12 \\,\\text{mL} \\times 10 \\,\\text{mg/mL} = 120 \\,\\text{mg}$$\n\nFinally, to find the maximum number of complete tracts, $N$, we must ensure that the total dose administered does not exceed the adjusted maximum safe dose. This relationship is expressed by the inequality:\n$$N \\times M_{\\text{tract}} \\le M_{\\text{adj}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$N \\times 120 \\,\\text{mg} \\le 318.5 \\,\\text{mg}$$\nSolving for $N$:\n$$N \\le \\frac{318.5}{120}$$\n$$N \\le 2.654166...$$\nThe problem states that only an integer number of complete tracts can be performed. Therefore, we must take the floor of the calculated value to find the maximum permissible integer $N$.\n$$N_{\\text{max}} = \\lfloor 2.654166... \\rfloor = 2$$\nThus, a maximum of $2$ complete tracts can be infiltrated without exceeding the adjusted safe dose of lidocaine for this patient.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "5177321"}]}
