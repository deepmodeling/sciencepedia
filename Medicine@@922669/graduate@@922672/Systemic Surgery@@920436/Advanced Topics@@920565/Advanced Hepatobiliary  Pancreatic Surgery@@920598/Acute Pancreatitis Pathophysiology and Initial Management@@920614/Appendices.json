You aim to compare three models used for early risk stratification within the first $24$ hours to guide Intensive Care Unit (ICU) triage: the Bedside Index for Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP), the Ranson score, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II).\n\nAs a starting point, use core definitions from prognostic model evaluation:\n- Discrimination is the ability to rank patients correctly by risk and is commonly quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), denoted $C$, where higher $C$ indicates better discrimination.\n- Calibration is the agreement between predicted and observed risks. In logistic calibration, the ideal calibration intercept is $0$ (no systematic over- or underprediction) and the ideal calibration slope is $1$ (no overfitting or underfitting of prediction extremity).\n- Overall accuracy can be summarized by the Brier score, with lower values indicating better accuracy.\n- Decision analysis at a risk threshold $p_{t}$ can be summarized by net benefit, which balances true positives against false positives according to the threshold probability.\n\nIn this cohort, model performance metrics estimated via internal validation are:\n- BISAP: $C=0.82$, calibration slope $=1.02$, calibration intercept $=-0.02$, Brier score $=0.12$.\n- Ranson: $C=0.78$, calibration slope $=1.30$, calibration intercept $=-0.20$, Brier score $=0.14$.\n- APACHE II: $C=0.85$, calibration slope $=0.88$, calibration intercept $=-0.08$, Brier score $=0.11$.\n\nFor a triage decision threshold of $p_{t}=0.30$ to admit to the ICU, you further summarize the classification at that threshold for each model across the $N=1000$ patients:\n- BISAP: $220$ predicted positive, of which $140$ are true positives and $80$ are false positives.\n- APACHE II: $260$ predicted positive, of which $145$ are true positives and $115$ are false positives.\n- Ranson: $180$ predicted positive, of which $110$ are true positives and $70$ are false positives.\n\nWhich of the following statements best integrates these results to guide initial management decisions in contemporary practice?\n\nA.
