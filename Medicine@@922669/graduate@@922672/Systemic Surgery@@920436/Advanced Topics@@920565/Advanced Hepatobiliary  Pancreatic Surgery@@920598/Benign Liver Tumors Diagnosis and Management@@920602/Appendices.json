Preoperative cross-sectional volumetry reports a Total Liver Volume (TLV) of $1500\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, a tumor volume of $200\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, and a planned Future Liver Remnant (FLR) of $450\\,\\mathrm{mL}$. In hepatobiliary surgical planning, a fundamental principle is that postoperative liver function capacity scales with the volume of viable, perfused parenchyma, while non-parenchymal or nonfunctional lesion volume (for example, tumor) is excluded from the functional denominator. Using this definition, compute the FLR proportion as the ratio of the planned remnant volume to the functional total liver volume (excluding tumor volume). Report the FLR proportion as a single unitless number, expressed as a decimal or a fraction, without a percentage sign.

The concepts of Total Liver Volume ($TLV$), Future Liver Remnant ($FLR$), and the calculation of a functional liver volume by excluding tumor mass are standard and critical practices to prevent post-hepatectomy liver failure. The provided volumes are clinically realistic.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data to perform the required calculation. The definition of \"FLR proportion\" is explicitly stated, leading to a unique numerical solution. The second part of the task, making a clinical judgment, relies on \"well-tested clinical facts.\" In the context of surgery for a patient with normal liver parenchyma, the minimum required FLR is a standard, widely accepted value (typically $>20\\%-25\\%$), making the problem decidable.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and clinical language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will now be formulated.\n\nThe solution requires two parts: first, the calculation of the Future Liver Remnant (FLR) proportion, and second, a decision on the feasibility of the surgery based on this proportion.\n\nLet $V_{TLV}$ be the Total Liver Volume, $V_{Tumor}$ be the tumor volume, and $V_{FLR}$ be the planned Future Liver Remnant volume.\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n$$V_{TLV} = 1500\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n$$V_{Tumor} = 200\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n$$V_{FLR} = 450\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThe problem defines the denominator for the FLR proportion as the \"functional total liver volume,\" which excludes the tumor volume. Let us denote this as $V_{FuncTLV}$.\nThis is calculated by subtracting the tumor volume from the total liver volume:\n$$V_{FuncTLV} = V_{TLV} - V_{Tumor}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$V_{FuncTLV} = 1500\\,\\mathrm{mL} - 200\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 1300\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nNext, the FLR proportion, which we will denote as $P_{FLR}$, is defined as the ratio of the planned remnant volume to this functional total liver volume.\n$$P_{FLR} = \\frac{V_{FLR}}{V_{FuncTLV}}$$\nSubstituting the values for $V_{FLR}$ and the calculated $V_{FuncTLV}$:\n$$P_{FLR} = \\frac{450\\,\\mathrm{mL}}{1300\\,\\mathrm{mL}}$$\nAs this is a ratio of volumes, the result is a unitless quantity. We can simplify the fraction:\n$$P_{FLR} = \\frac{450}{1300} = \\frac{45}{130} = \\frac{9 \\times 5}{26 \\times 5} = \\frac{9}{26}$$\nAs a decimal, this value is approximately $0.34615$. Since the problem does not require rounding, the exact fractional form $\\frac{9}{26}$ is a complete answer for the first part of the task.\n\nThe second part of the task is to decide whether the planned operation is feasible. This decision relies on \"well-tested clinical facts.\" For a patient with otherwise normal liver parenchyma (i.e., no underlying cirrhosis, steatosis, or cholestasis), a major hepatectomy is generally considered safe if the planned Future Liver Remnant proportion is greater than $20\\%$. Some centers use a more conservative threshold of $25\\%$. We will use the commonly accepted minimum threshold of $20\\%$.\nThe minimum required FLR proportion, $P_{min}$, is therefore:\n$$P_{min} = 20\\% = 0.20 = \\frac{1}{5}$$\nWe must compare the calculated $P_{FLR}$ to this threshold:\nIs $P_{FLR} > P_{min}$?\nIs $\\frac{9}{26} > \\frac{1}{5}$?\nTo compare the fractions, we can find a common denominator or use cross-multiplication. Using cross-multiplication:\n$$9 \\times 5 \\quad ? \\quad 26 \\times 1$$\n$$45 > 26$$\nThe inequality holds true. The calculated FLR proportion of $\\frac{9}{26}$ (approximately $34.6\\%$) is significantly greater than the minimum safety threshold of $20\\%$.\nTherefore, based on the volumetric analysis and standard clinical guidelines, the planned anatomic hepatectomy is considered feasible for this patient with normal liver parenchyma. The primary numerical answer requested is the FLR proportion itself.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{9}{26}}$$", "id": "5087848"}, {"introduction": "Modern management of benign liver tumors extends beyond simple identification to include sophisticated risk stratification. For hepatocellular adenomas, certain molecular subtypes, such as those with beta-catenin activation, carry a significant risk of malignant transformation.

Express the final probability as a decimal and round your answer to four significant figures. Then, briefly interpret how this magnitude of post-test probability would generally impact management decisions for benign liver tumors in a surgically resectable patient, given contemporary principles of risk stratification for malignant transformation in hepatocellular adenoma subtypes.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in probability theory and clinical medicine, well-posed with sufficient data for a unique solution, and objective in its formulation. All criteria for a valid problem are met.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the post-test probability of a hepatocellular adenoma being beta-catenin-activated given a positive immunohistochemistry (IHC) result. This is a direct application of Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that the adenoma is beta-catenin-activated.\nLet $A^c$ be the complement event, i.e., the adenoma is not beta-catenin-activated.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the IHC test result is positive.\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the IHC test result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe pretest probability of the adenoma being beta-catenin-activated is the prior probability, $P(A) = 0.10$.\nThe sensitivity of the IHC test is the probability of a positive test given that the adenoma is beta-catenin-activated: $P(T^+|A) = 0.90$.\nThe specificity of the IHC test is the probability of a negative test given that the adenoma is not beta-catenin-activated: $P(T^-|A^c) = 0.95$.\n\nWe need to compute the post-test probability, which is the conditional probability $P(A|T^+)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the probabilities of the complementary events. The prior probability of the adenoma not being beta-catenin-activated is:\n$$ P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 $$\nThe specificity gives $P(T^-|A^c)$. The probability of a positive test given that the adenoma is not beta-catenin-activated (the false positive rate) is:\n$$ P(T^+|A^c) = 1 - P(T^-|A^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\n\nBayes' theorem states:\n$$ P(A|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|A) P(A)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+|A) P(A) + P(T^+|A^c) P(A^c) $$\nSubstituting the given and derived values into this equation:\n$$ P(T^+) = (0.90)(0.10) + (0.05)(0.90) $$\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.090 + 0.045 = 0.135 $$\n\nNow, we can substitute the values for $P(T^+|A)$, $P(A)$, and $P(T^+)$ back into Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(A|T^+) = \\frac{(0.90)(0.10)}{0.135} $$\n$$ P(A|T^+) = \\frac{0.090}{0.135} $$\nTo simplify the fraction:\n$$ P(A|T^+) = \\frac{90}{135} = \\frac{2 \\times 45}{3 \\times 45} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nThe problem asks for the probability to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P(A|T^+) = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.666666... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$ P(A|T^+) \\approx 0.6667 $$\n\nFor the interpretation of this result in a clinical context:\nHepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) are benign liver tumors, but they are not uniform in their biological behavior. Contemporary management is guided by a molecular classification that stratifies the risk of complications, most importantly malignant transformation into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The beta-catenin-activated HCA subtype (b-HCA) is of particular concern because it carries the highest risk of malignant transformation, estimated at $5$-$10\\%$.\n\nThe pretest probability of $0.10$ (or $10\\%$) represents the baseline suspicion for b-HCA based on clinical and imaging findings, which is consistent with the general prevalence of this subtype. After a positive IHC test for nuclear beta-catenin, the probability has increased dramatically to approximately $0.67$ (or $67\\%$). This is a significant revision of risk. A post-test probability of this magnitude would strongly influence clinical management. For a surgically resectable patient, a low probability might favor a strategy of surveillance with serial imaging, particularly for smaller lesions (e.g., $< 5$ cm). However, a high probability ($67\\%$) of having a lesion with a known malignant potential would typically shift the recommendation decisively towards surgical resection, regardless of tumor size. This is to remove the lesion definitively and thereby eliminate the risk of future malignant transformation. The IHC test, by increasing the certainty of the diagnosis from $10\\%$ to $67\\%$, provides crucial information that justifies a more aggressive management approach (surgery) over a more conservative one (observation). This case exemplifies the core principle of risk stratification in modern surgical oncology, where diagnostic tools are used to tailor treatment to the specific biology of a patient's disease.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0.6667} $$", "id": "5087780"}, {"introduction": "The diagnostic power of an imaging study is not determined by its sensitivity and specificity alone; the pretest probability, or prevalence of the disease in the population, is equally critical.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in conditional probability, specifically an application of Bayes' theorem to medical diagnostics. All necessary data are provided, the terminology is precise, and the question is objective.\n\nLet us define the relevant events:\n- $H$: The event that the patient has hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n- $B$: The event that the patient has a benign liver tumor. Given the problem's context of HCC versus benign tumors, these events are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.\n- $M$: The event that the MRI shows malignant features (a \"positive\" test result).\n- $M^c$: The event that the MRI does not show malignant features (a \"negative\" test result).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we extract the following probabilities:\n- The pretest probability of HCC (prevalence): $P(H) = 0.02$.\n- The sensitivity of the MRI for HCC, which is the probability of a positive test given the disease is present: $P(M \\mid H) = 0.85$.\n- The specificity of the MRI for HCC, which is the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent (i.e., the tumor is benign): $P(M^c \\mid B) = 0.90$.\n\nFrom these given probabilities, we can derive two additional probabilities required for the calculation:\n- The pretest probability of a benign tumor is the complement of the pretest probability of HCC:\n$$ P(B) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 $$\n- The probability of a positive test given that the tumor is benign (the false positive rate) is the complement of the specificity:\n$$ P(M \\mid B) = 1 - P(M^c \\mid B) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 $$\n\nThe problem asks for the post-imaging probability of HCC given the presence of malignant features on the MRI, which is the conditional probability $P(H \\mid M)$. We will compute this using Bayes' theorem, which is stated as:\n$$ P(H \\mid M) = \\frac{P(M \\mid H) P(H)}{P(M)} $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(M)$, represents the total probability of obtaining a positive MRI result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, summing over the two mutually exclusive states (HCC or benign):\n$$ P(M) = P(M \\mid H) P(H) + P(M \\mid B) P(B) $$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $P(M)$ into Bayes' theorem gives the full formula in terms of our known values:\n$$ P(H \\mid M) = \\frac{P(M \\mid H) P(H)}{P(M \\mid H) P(H) + P(M \\mid B) P(B)} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this expression:\n$$ P(H \\mid M) = \\frac{(0.85)(0.02)}{(0.85)(0.02) + (0.10)(0.98)} $$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\n- Numerator (True Positives proportion): $(0.85)(0.02) = 0.017$.\n- Denominator (Total Positives proportion): $(0.85)(0.02) + (0.10)(0.98) = 0.017 + 0.098 = 0.115$.\n\nNow we can compute the final probability:\n$$ P(H \\mid M) = \\frac{0.017}{0.115} \\approx 0.14782608... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$ P(H \\mid M) \\approx 0.1478 $$\n\nFor the second part of the question, we must explain why a benign diagnosis remains more likely. The probability of HCC, given the positive MRI, is $P(H \\mid M) \\approx 0.1478$. The complementary probability, that the tumor is benign given the positive MRI, is $P(B \\mid M)$. Since the outcomes $H$ and $B$ are exhaustive given the presence of a tumor, we have:\n$$ P(B \\mid M) = 1 - P(H \\mid M) \\approx 1 - 0.1478 = 0.8522 $$\nComparing the two post-test probabilities, $P(B \\mid M) \\approx 0.8522$ is substantially greater than $P(H \\mid M) \\approx 0.1478$. This means that even after an MRI shows malignant features, there is an approximately $85.2\\%$ chance that the tumor is benign, compared to only a $14.8\\%$ chance that it is HCC.\n\nThis counterintuitive result is a direct consequence of the low pretest probability (or prevalence) of HCC in this population, a phenomenon known as the base rate fallacy. The initial population has a very large proportion of benign cases ($98\\%$) compared to HCC cases ($2\\%$). The false positive rate of $10\\%$ applied to this large benign population generates a substantial number of false positive results ($P(M \\text{ and } B) = P(M \\mid B)P(B) = 0.10 \\times 0.98 = 0.098$). This number of false positives overwhelms the number of true positive results ($P(M \\text{ and } H) = P(M \\mid H)P(H) = 0.85 \\times 0.02 = 0.017$). Consequently, a positive test result is more likely to be a false positive from a benign case than a true positive from an HCC case. In the context of decision-making for systemic surgery, a highly invasive procedure, a post-test probability of malignancy of only $\\approx 15\\%$ is insufficient to justify surgery. The risk of subjecting a patient with a high probability of having a benign condition to major surgery necessitates further, more definitive diagnostic steps, such as a biopsy, before proceeding.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.1478}\n$$", "id": "5087793"}]}
