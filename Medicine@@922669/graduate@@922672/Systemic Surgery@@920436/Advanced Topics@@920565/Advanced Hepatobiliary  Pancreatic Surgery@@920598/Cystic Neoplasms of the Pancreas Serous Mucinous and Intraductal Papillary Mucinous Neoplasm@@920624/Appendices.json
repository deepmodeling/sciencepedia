The survival function, $S(t)$, is defined as the probability that the event of interest (progression) has not occurred by time $t$. Mathematically, this is:\n$$ S(t) = \\Pr(T \\ge t) $$\nThe instantaneous hazard function, $h(t)$, represents the instantaneous rate of progression at time $t$, given that the patient has not progressed up to time $t$.
