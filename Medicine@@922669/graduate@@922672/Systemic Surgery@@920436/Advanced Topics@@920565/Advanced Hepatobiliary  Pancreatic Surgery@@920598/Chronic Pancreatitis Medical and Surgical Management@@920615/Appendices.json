The gastrointestinal tract is patent without gastric outlet obstruction, and there is no hemodynamic instability. Using the foundational clinical fact that energy requirements for surgical patients scale approximately with body mass and that malnourished patients awaiting major surgery benefit from the higher end of established per-kilogram targets, select values within the ranges of $25$ to $30$ kilocalories per kilogram per day and $1.2$ to $1.5$ grams of protein per kilogram per day to construct a daily nutritional plan.

Briefly justify, using first principles of surgical physiology and gastrointestinal function, whether enteral nutrition or parenteral nutrition is appropriate; this qualitative decision does not affect the numerical computation of the NPC:N ratio.\n\nExpress the final NPC:N ratio as a unitless number. Do not round; provide the exact integer value if one arises from your calculation.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of clinical nutrition and surgical metabolism, providing realistic clinical data and standard physiological conversion factors. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information and clear, unambiguous instructions, including guidance on selecting from the provided ranges. This structure permits the derivation of a unique, meaningful solution. There are no internal contradictions, factual errors, or violations of physical laws. The problem is formalizable and directly relevant to the stated domain.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first establishing the daily nutritional targets based on the provided information. The patient's body mass is given as $M = 65 \\text{ kg}$. The patient is described as malnourished and awaiting major surgery, for which the problem directs the use of the higher end of the provided nutritional target ranges.\n\nThe energy requirement range is $25$ to $30 \\text{ kcal/kg/day}$.

The higher end is selected to support anabolism and replete lean body mass:\nProtein target: $P_{target} = 1.5 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}}$\n\nNext, the total daily energy and protein requirements are calculated:\nTotal Daily Energy: $E_{total} = E_{target} \\times M = 30 \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} \\times 65 \\text{ kg} = 1950 \\text{ kcal/day}$\nTotal Daily Protein: $P_{total} = P_{target} \\times M = 1.5 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} \\times 65 \\text{ kg} = 97.5 \\text{ g/day}$\n\nThe problem states that protein provides $k_P = 4 \\text{ kcal/g}$.

The problem requests the unitless number.\n\nRegarding the choice of nutrition delivery, the problem provides critical information: \"the gastrointestinal tract is patent without gastric outlet obstruction, and there is no hemodynamic instability.\" The primary principle of clinical nutrition is \"if the gut works, use it.\" Enteral nutrition (EN) maintains the structural and functional integrity of the gut mucosa, which serves as a critical barrier against bacterial translocation from the gut lumen into the systemic circulation. Compared to parenteral nutrition (PN), EN is associated with a lower risk of infectious complications (especially catheter-related bloodstream infections), is more physiological in its stimulation of gut hormones and metabolic effects, and is significantly less costly. Given that the patient's gastrointestinal tract is functional and there are no contraindications such as shock, ileus, or obstruction, enteral nutrition is the unequivocally appropriate choice. In the context of pancreatitis, feeding is often delivered via a post-pyloric (e.g., jejunal) tube to bypass the pancreas, thereby minimizing exocrine stimulation while still leveraging the benefits of enteral feeding.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{100}$$", "id": "5097592"}, {"introduction": "The decision to intervene in chronic pancreatitis is followed by a crucial question: which intervention is best?

The choice of intervention must weigh morbidity and durability against the specific disease anatomy.\n\n**Definition of Optimized Nonoperative Care:**\nIncludes alcohol and tobacco cessation, opioid-sparing analgesia, pancreatic enzyme therapy, fat-soluble vitamin repletion, and glycemic management.\n\n**Patient Scenarios (all have failed nonoperative care, except where noted for Patient IV):**\n\n*   **Patient I:**\n    *   Age: $52$ years\n    *   Diagnosis: Calcific chronic pancreatitis\n    *   Main Pancreatic Duct (MPD): Diffuse dilation to $9\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n    *   Stones: Multiple large intraductal stones, not amenable to extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL)\n    *   Head Mass: Absent\n    *   Pseudocyst: Absent\n    *   Symptoms: Persistent, clinically meaningful pain\n\n*   **Patient II:**\n    *   Age: $59$ years\n    *   Diagnosis: Head-dominant chronic pancreatitis\n    *   Head Mass: $3.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ irregular inflammatory mass\n    *   MPD: Nondilated, $3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n    *   Symptoms: Progressive obstructive jaundice, weight loss\n    *   Biopsy: Indeterminate cytology on Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Fine Needle Aspiration (EUS-FNA); malignancy cannot be confidently excluded\n\n*   **Patient III:**\n    *   Age: $46$ years\n    *   Pseudocyst: $6.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, mature (well-formed wall), located in the pancreatic body\n    *   Symptoms: Early satiety and pain, caused by the pseudocyst which is indenting the posterior gastric wall\n    *   MPD: $5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n    *   Head Mass: Absent\n\n*   **Patient IV:**\n    *   Age: $41$ years\n    *   Diagnosis: \"Small-duct\" chronic pancreatitis\n    *   MPD: $3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n    *   Head Mass: Absent\n    *   Pseudocyst: Incidental, asymptomatic, $2.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n    *   Symptoms: Pain has improved to a tolerable baseline with ongoing nonoperative measures; no weight loss or hospitalizations.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem is evaluated against the established criteria:\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on established pathophysiology and clinical management principles for chronic pancreatitis. The anatomical classifications (large-duct vs. small-duct disease, presence of head mass, pseudocysts) and corresponding treatments (decompression, resection, drainage) are standard in general and pancreaticobiliary surgery. The scenarios are medically realistic.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear set of guiding principles and four distinct, well-described clinical cases. The task is to apply the principles to the cases to find the best-fitting management plan from the options. A unique, logical solution can be derived.\n*   **Objective:** The problem uses precise, objective clinical language and measurable data (e.g., duct diameter in $\\mathrm{mm}$, mass size in $\\mathrm{cm}$). There are no subjective or opinion-based statements in the problem setup.\n*   **No Flaws Detected:** The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, is clinically realistic, and is well-structured. It represents a standard, non-trivial clinical reasoning task.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will now be derived by applying the given principles to each patient scenario, followed by an evaluation of the provided options.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe core task is to apply the fundamental principles to each patient's anatomy and clinical status to determine the most logical initial intervention.\n\n**Analysis of Patient I:**\n*   **Dominant Anatomy and Pain Generator:** The key features are a diffusely dilated main pancreatic duct ($9\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) and multiple large, obstructing intraductal stones. This anatomy points directly to **ductal hypertension** as the primary source of pain. There is no head mass or pseudocyst to address.\n*   **Intervention Goal:** Ductal decompression. Given the diffuse nature of the dilation and the presence of large stones not amenable to endoscopic or ESWL treatment, a surgical approach that provides longitudinal drainage of the entire pancreatic duct is required.\n*   **Appropriate Procedure:** The **lateral pancreaticojejunostomy (modified Puestow procedure)** is the classic operation for this indication. It involves opening the pancreatic duct along its length and creating a side-to-side anastomosis with a loop of jejunum, effectively decompressing the entire gland.\n\n**Analysis of Patient II:**\n*   **Dominant Anatomy and Pain Generator:** The defining feature is the $3.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ inflammatory mass in the pancreatic head. The duct is not dilated ($3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$). The pain and, more urgently, the obstructive jaundice and weight loss are caused by this mass.\n*   **Critical consideration:** Malignancy cannot be excluded. This is a crucial point. For any pancreatic head mass with indeterminate biopsy results, progressive obstruction, and weight loss, the management must proceed with the assumption of potential malignancy.\n*   **Intervention Goal:** The primary goals are to resect the mass to relieve the obstruction (biliary and potentially duodenal) and, critically, to obtain a definitive histopathological diagnosis and achieve a potential cure if it is cancer.\n*   **Appropriate Procedure:** A simple decompression or coring procedure (like Frey) is inadequate because it is not an oncologic resection. The standard and most appropriate operation is a **pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure)**, which is a formal resection of the pancreatic head.\n\n**Analysis of Patient III:**\n*   **Dominant Anatomy and Pain Generator:** The problem is explicitly a large ($6.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$), mature, and **symptomatic** pseudocyst, causing pain and mass effect (early satiety). The duct is only minimally dilated ($5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), and there is no head mass.\n*   **Intervention Goal:** Drainage of the symptomatic pseudocyst.\n*   **Appropriate Procedure:** The pseudocyst has a mature wall and is located adjacent to the stomach (\"indenting the posterior gastric wall on EUS\"). This is the ideal anatomical situation for minimally invasive transmural drainage. The modern standard of care is **Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided (EUS) cystogastrostomy**, where a connection is made between the cyst and the stomach under EUS guidance to allow internal drainage. This is less invasive than surgical drainage with comparable efficacy.\n\n**Analysis of Patient IV:**\n*   **Dominant Anatomy and Clinical Status:** This patient has \"small-duct\" disease (MPD is $3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) and an incidental, small ($2.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$), asymptomatic pseudocyst. Critically, the patient's pain has improved to a **tolerable baseline** with optimized nonoperative care, and there are no significant complications like weight loss or hospitalizations.\n*   **Intervention Goal:** The principle of weighing morbidity against benefit is paramount here. The patient's condition is stable and adequately managed medically. The pseudocyst is small and asymptomatic, requiring no intervention. Small-duct disease is challenging to treat procedurally, and the risks of intervention (e.g., post-ERCP pancreatitis, surgical morbidity) far outweigh the potential benefits for a patient with tolerable symptoms.\n*   **Appropriate Management:** No intervention is indicated at this time. The correct course is to **continue optimized medical management** and monitor the patient's clinical status.\n\n### Summary of Correct Management Pathway\n*   **Patient I:** Lateral pancreaticojejunostomy (Puestow)\n*   **Patient II:** Pancreaticoduodenectomy\n*   **Patient III:** Endoscopic ultrasound-guided cystogastrostomy\n*   **Patient IV:** Continue optimized medical management\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow, we evaluate each option against our derived pathway.\n\n**A. I: Lateral pancreaticojejunostomy (Puestow); II: Pancreaticoduodenectomy; III: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided cystogastrostomy; IV: Continue optimized medical management.**\n*   **I (Puestow):** **Correct**. Matches our derived management for large-duct disease without a head mass.\n*   **II (Pancreaticoduodenectomy):** **Correct**. Matches our derived management for a head mass suspicious for malignancy.\n*   **III (EUS-cystogastrostomy):** **Correct**. Matches our derived management for a symptomatic, mature pseudocyst.\n*   **IV (Continue medical management):** **Correct**. Matches our derived management for stable, medically-controlled small-duct disease.\n*   **Verdict:** This option perfectly aligns with the logical application of the fundamental principles to all four patient scenarios. **Correct**.\n\n**B. I: Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with pancreatic sphincterotomy and ductal stenting; II: Frey procedure (local head coring with longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy); III: Percutaneous catheter drainage; IV: Distal pancreatectomy.**\n*   **I (ERCP):** **Incorrect**. ERCP is inadequate for diffuse disease with large stones not amenable to endoscopic removal.\n*   **II (Frey):** **Incorrect**. A Frey procedure is not an oncologic operation and is inappropriate when malignancy cannot be excluded.\n*   **III (Percutaneous drainage):** **Incorrect**. This is a second-line option with higher risk of pancreatic-cutaneous fistula compared to EUS-guided internal drainage.\n*   **IV (Distal pancreatectomy):** **Incorrect**. This is a major, unwarranted resection for a patient with medically controlled, tolerable pain.\n*   **Verdict:** This option is incorrect on all four points. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. I: Frey procedure; II: Observation with interval imaging; III: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided cystogastrostomy; IV: ERCP with pancreatic duct stenting.**\n*   **I (Frey):** **Incorrect**. A Frey procedure is indicated for a combination of head mass and dilated duct. This patient has no head mass.\n*   **II (Observation):** **Incorrect**. Observation is medically inappropriate for a patient with progressive jaundice, weight loss, and a potential malignancy.\n*   **III (EUS-cystogastrostomy):** **Correct**.\n*   **IV (ERCP):** **Incorrect**. Invasive procedure with risk of pancreatitis is not justified for a patient with tolerable, stable pain.\n*   **Verdict:** This option contains multiple critical errors in management. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. I: Pancreaticoduodenectomy; II: Lateral pancreaticojejunostomy (Puestow); III: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided cystogastrostomy; IV: Continue optimized medical management.**\n*   **I (Pancreaticoduodenectomy):** **Incorrect**. This is an inappropriate and overly aggressive surgery for a patient with no head mass. It also fails to decompress the duct in the body and tail.\n*   **II (Puestow):** **Incorrect**. This procedure is for a dilated duct, which this patient does not have. It fails to address the head mass. It appears the procedures for I and II have been switched.\n*   **III (EUS-cystogastrostomy):** **Correct**.\n*   **IV (Continue medical management):** **Correct**.\n*   **Verdict:** This option incorrectly swaps the appropriate surgical procedures for Patients I and II. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the analysis, only Option A provides a coherent and correct management plan for all four patients that is consistent with the provided principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5097591"}, {"introduction": "Managing recurrent pain after a major pancreatic operation is one of the most complex challenges in surgical practice.

Begin with comprehensive reassessment (diet, alcohol/tobacco, enzyme adherence, glycemic control, and opioid stewardship), then obtain contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) or secretin-stimulated Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to evaluate for residual intraductal stones, pancreaticojejunal anastomotic stricture, pseudocyst, or biliary obstruction; if obstructive pathology is identified, proceed to Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) for stones larger than $5$ mm followed by device-assisted Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)-guided pancreatic duct access for stone extraction and balloon dilation with temporary stenting of strictures; if endotherapy is not feasible or fails, consider targeted revisional surgery; if imaging is negative or disproportionate to pain and pain persists beyond $3$ months despite optimized medical therapy, evaluate for central sensitization with validated tools and Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) and manage via a multidisciplinary pain program with neuromodulatory agents and consider neuromodulation (e.g., thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy), reserving Total Pancreatectomy with Islet Autotransplantation (TPIAT) for highly selected, refractory cases.\n\nB. Proceed directly to ERCP for all patients with recurrent pain after Frey, extract any stones and empirically place a pancreatic stent; if ERCP does not reveal a lesion, schedule a total pancreatectomy, as persistent pain indicates end-stage disease; defer cross-sectional imaging and do not assess central pain mechanisms to avoid delays.\n\nC.

If pain persists for more than $6$ weeks after the Frey procedure, plan an immediate redo Frey with more extensive head coring to eliminate microscopic disease; defer imaging and endoscopic interventions to avoid confounding postoperative anatomy; central sensitization assessment is unnecessary because persistent pain implies inadequate decompression.\n\nE. Start with upper endoscopy to rule out peptic disease, then perform EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis; if pain recurs, obtain MRCP and, if stones are seen, schedule repeat open pancreatic drainage; reserve ERCP only for biliary strictures because access to the pancreatic duct is not possible after a Frey procedure; central sensitization is considered only after two surgical attempts have failed.\n\nSelect the single best option.", "solution": "The user has provided a clinical problem regarding the management of recurrent pain after a Frey procedure for chronic pancreatitis and has requested a validation of the problem statement, followed by a detailed solution.\n\n### PROBLEM VALIDATION\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n*   **Patient Profile:** A patient with long-standing alcohol-related chronic calcific pancreatitis.\n*   **Surgical History:** Frey procedure (pancreatic head coring with longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy) performed $12$ months prior to presentation.\n*   **Indication for Surgery:** Refractory pain from large-duct disease with head-dominant fibrosis.\n*   **Pre-Surgical Findings:** Intraductal calculi, dilated main pancreatic duct, no biliary stricture.\n*   **Post-Surgical Course:** Pain-free for an initial $6$-month period.\n*   **Current Symptoms:** Recurrent, daily epigastric pain radiating to the back.\n*   **Current Medications:** Intermittent short-acting opioids; inconsistent use of pancrelipase.\n*   **Social History:** Complete alcohol and tobacco abstinence for $9$ months.\n*   **Physical Examination:** Weight loss of $4$ kg over $3$ months, mild epigastric tenderness, no jaundice.\n*   **Laboratory Findings:** Normal serum lipase, Hemoglobin A1c of $8.1\\%$, low stool elastase.\n*   **Guiding Principles for Management (Provided):**\n    1.

The clinical scenario—recurrent pain after a drainage procedure for chronic pancreatitis—is a common and complex challenge.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. The provided information is sufficient and consistent for deriving a solution. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe task is to identify the management algorithm that best aligns with the provided patient data and guiding principles. The patient presents with recurrent pain $12$ months after a Frey procedure, following a $6$-month pain-free interval. This clinical history strongly suggests a new or recurrent mechanical issue rather than a primary failure of the initial surgery. The principles mandate a stepwise approach: optimize medical therapy, use non-invasive imaging to identify a potential mechanical cause, prioritize less invasive (endoscopic) treatment over more invasive (surgical) options, and consider central pain mechanisms if no mechanical cause is found.\n\n**Step-by-Step Ideal Algorithm Construction:**\n\n1.  **Foundation:** The initial step must be a comprehensive reassessment of conservative management. This includes verifying abstinence, optimizing pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) which is being taken inconsistently and can contribute to pain from maldigestion, managing the newly diagnosed poor glycemic control (HbA1c $8.1\\%$), and developing a strategy for opioid stewardship to prevent dependence and opioid-induced hyperalgesia.\n2.  **Diagnosis of Mechanical Cause:** Following Principle 2, high-yield, non-invasive imaging is required to investigate for an obstructive cause. In a patient with post-surgical anatomy like a pancreaticojejunostomy, contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), especially with secretin stimulation (S-MRCP), are the modalities of choice. They can effectively visualize the pancreatic duct, the anastomosis, and surrounding structures to identify potential causes like an anastomotic stricture, residual/recurrent stones, or a pseudocyst.\n3.  **Intervention for Mechanical Cause:** If imaging reveals an obstructive pathology, Principle 3 dictates that endoscopic therapy should be attempted before considering re-operation. Standard Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is impossible due to the Roux-en-Y reconstruction. Therefore, advanced endoscopic techniques are necessary, such as device-assisted enteroscopy (e.g., balloon enteroscopy) to reach the pancreaticojejunostomy. Alternatively, Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) can provide high-resolution imaging and a potential route for guided access to the pancreatic duct (EUS-PDD). For large stones ($5$ mm), Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL) can be used for fragmentation prior to endoscopic removal. If a stricture is found, it can be treated with balloon dilation and stenting. Revisional surgery is reserved for cases where endoscopic therapy is technically not feasible or fails.\n4.  **Management of Non-Mechanical Pain:** If comprehensive imaging rules out a significant mechanical cause, or if pain persists despite successful treatment of an identified lesion, Principle 4 becomes paramount. This points towards a nociplastic pain state, such as central sensitization. This should be formally evaluated (e.g., with validated questionnaires, Quantitative Sensory Testing). Management requires a multidisciplinary approach involving pain specialists, psychologists, and dietitians, focusing on non-opioid neuromodulatory agents (e.g., gabapentinoids, tricyclic antidepressants). For the most refractory cases, advanced options like thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy or, as a final resort, Total Pancreatectomy with Islet Autotransplantation (TPIAT), may be considered in highly selected patients at specialized centers.\n\n### OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. Begin with comprehensive reassessment..., then obtain contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) or secretin-stimulated Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)..., if obstructive pathology is identified, proceed to... device-assisted Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)-guided pancreatic duct access..., if endotherapy is not feasible or fails, consider targeted revisional surgery; if imaging is negative..., evaluate for central sensitization... and manage via a multidisciplinary pain program...**\n\n*   This option follows a perfectly logical and evidence-based sequence. It starts with conservative measures, proceeds to appropriate advanced imaging, prioritizes modern, minimally invasive endoscopic techniques suitable for altered anatomy, correctly places revisional surgery as a secondary option, and incorporates the crucial concept of central sensitization for cases without a clear mechanical driver. This algorithm is in complete concordance with all four guiding principles provided in the problem statement.\n*   **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Proceed directly to ERCP for all patients with recurrent pain after Frey, extract any stones and empirically place a pancreatic stent; if ERCP does not reveal a lesion, schedule a total pancreatectomy...**\n\n*   This option is fundamentally flawed. It violates Principle 2 by proceeding directly to an invasive procedure without prior non-invasive imaging. It is factually incorrect as standard ERCP is not feasible in this anatomy. It proposes an extremely aggressive and unwarranted escalation to total pancreatectomy, completely ignoring less invasive options and other potential pain etiologies, thereby violating Principles 3 and 4.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Escalate opioid therapy and perform celiac plexus neurolysis as first-line measures to address presumed neuropathic pain; obtain CT only if pain persists beyond $6$ months...**\n\n*   This option proposes inappropriate first-line therapies. Opioid escalation is poor practice, and celiac plexus neurolysis has limited, short-term efficacy and fails to address the likely underlying mechanical problem. It violates Principle 2 by unacceptably delaying diagnostic imaging, which is critical given the patient's weight loss and daily pain.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. If pain persists for more than $6$ weeks after the Frey procedure, plan an immediate redo Frey with more extensive head coring... defer imaging and endoscopic interventions...**\n\n*   This option is invalid for this patient, who was pain-free for $6$ months. More importantly, it violates Principles 2 and 3 by deferring all imaging and endoscopic evaluation and proceeding directly to high-risk re-operation. It also incorrectly dismisses the concept of central sensitization (violating Principle 4), assuming all pain is due to inadequate surgery.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Start with upper endoscopy to rule out peptic disease, then perform EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis; if pain recurs, obtain MRCP and... schedule repeat open pancreatic drainage; reserve ERCP only for biliary strictures because access to the pancreatic duct is not possible after a Frey procedure...**\n\n*   This option is illogical and contains factual errors. While ruling out peptic disease is reasonable, prioritizing it over imaging of the pancreas is incorrect. Celiac plexus neurolysis is not a primary therapy. The statement that pancreatic duct access is not possible after a Frey procedure is false; it is possible with advanced techniques. The algorithm improperly delays definitive imaging (MRCP) and defaults to surgery over endoscopy for stones, violating Principle 3.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5097635"}]}
