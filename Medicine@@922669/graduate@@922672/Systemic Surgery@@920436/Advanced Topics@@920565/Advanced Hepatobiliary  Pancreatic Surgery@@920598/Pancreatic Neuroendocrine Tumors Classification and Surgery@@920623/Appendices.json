Using the core definition that the Ki-67 index is the fraction of Ki-67 positive tumor nuclei among the total tumor nuclei counted, derive the Ki-67 index as a decimal fraction. Then, using the World Health Organization (WHO) 2017/2019 grading thresholds for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors based on Ki-67 index (Grade $1$: Ki-67 index $ 0.03$, Grade $2$: Ki-67 index in $[0.03, 0.20]$, Grade $3$: Ki-67 index $ 0.20$), assign the WHO grade from first principles.

The Ki-67 index $I$ is defined as the fraction of Ki-67 positive tumor nuclei among the total number of tumor nuclei counted. Let $n_{+}$ denote the number of Ki-67 positive nuclei and let $n_{\\text{tot}}$ denote the total number of tumor nuclei counted. The definition is\n$$\nI \\equiv \\frac{n_{+}}{n_{\\text{tot}}}.\n$$\nWe are given $n_{+} = 120$ and $n_{\\text{tot}} = 2000$. Substituting,\n$$\nI = \\frac{120}{2000}.\n$$\nWe simplify this fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{120}{2000} = \\frac{12}{200} = \\frac{3}{50}.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\nI = \\frac{3}{50} = 0.06.\n$$\n\nNext, we assign a World Health Organization (WHO) grade according to well-tested grading thresholds for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors based on the Ki-67 index. The thresholds are:\n- Grade $1$: Ki-67 index $ 0.03$,\n- Grade $2$: Ki-67 index in $[0.03, 0.20]$,\n- Grade $3$: Ki-67 index $ 0.20$.\n\nOur computed $I = 0.06$ lies within the interval $[0.03, 0.20]$. Therefore, the WHO grade is Grade $2$. By the problem’s coding, this corresponds to\n$$\nG = 2.\n$$\n\nWe now discuss how this grade informs operative strategy in systemic surgery for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, grounding the reasoning in foundational surgical oncology principles rather than heuristic rules. The fundamental base includes:\n- The oncologic principle that higher proliferative activity (as measured by Ki-67 index) correlates with increased risk of lymph node metastasis and recurrence, which in turn motivates more comprehensive oncologic resections with lymphadenectomy to achieve complete margin-negative ($\\text{R}0$) resection and appropriate nodal staging.\n- The well-established distinction between parenchyma-sparing procedures (such as enucleation) and formal anatomical resections (such as distal pancreatectomy or pancreaticoduodenectomy) with lymphadenectomy, where the latter provide systematic nodal assessment and wider margins at the cost of greater parenchymal loss and morbidity.\n\nApplying these principles to a pNET with $I = 0.06$ (Grade $2$):\n- The Ki-67 index of $0.06$ indicates intermediate proliferative activity (higher than Grade $1$ and substantially lower than Grade $3$), which is associated with a nontrivial risk of lymph node involvement compared to Grade $1$ tumors. This elevates the importance of nodal assessment and achieving an oncologically sound margin.\n- Consequently, operative strategy should favor formal oncologic resection with regional lymphadenectomy for non-functioning lesions of clinically relevant size or location, to accomplish $\\text{R}0$ margins and accurate nodal staging. Parenchyma-sparing enucleation is more appropriate for small, well-differentiated Grade $1$ functioning tumors (for example, insulinomas) that are away from the main pancreatic duct and have low nodal risk; for Grade $2$, the higher proliferative index supports a shift toward anatomical resection over enucleation, unless exceptional circumstances (very small, clearly benign behavior, and safe distance from the duct) argue otherwise.\n- In summary, the Grade $2$ assignment informs a strategy prioritizing margin-negative anatomical resection with nodal sampling or dissection, rather than routine enucleation, consistent with the increased proliferative activity and corresponding oncologic risk profile.\n\nFinally, we compute the aggregated metric $S$ defined by the problem:\n$$\nS \\equiv G + I = 2 + 0.06 = 2.06.\n$$\nWe are instructed to round $S$ to four significant figures.

The question asks for a single combined answer based on established clinical guidelines, making a unique solution derivable.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is composed of objective clinical findings (e.g., tumor measurement, pathological results, imaging reports). It is free of subjective, ambiguous, or opinion-based language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to proceed. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. The solution will proceed by first determining the correct TNM stage and then identifying the appropriate surgical intervention.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe solution requires two main components: correct staging according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th Edition staging manual for Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Pancreas, and identification of the standard-of-care surgical procedure.\n\n**1. TNM Staging and Stage Grouping**\n\nThe TNM classification for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) is distinct from that for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.\n\n**T (Primary Tumor):**\n- **T1:** Tumor limited to the pancreas, maximal diameter $\\le 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n- **T2:** Tumor limited to the pancreas, maximal diameter $ 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and $\\le 4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n- **T3:** Tumor limited to the pancreas and maximal diameter $ 4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, OR tumor invading the duodenum or common bile duct.\n- **T4:** Tumor invades adjacent organs (stomach, spleen, colon, adrenal gland) or the wall of large vessels (celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery).\n\nIn this case, the tumor's maximal diameter is $5.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, which is $ 4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. Additionally, the tumor \"invades the intrapancreatic common bile duct\". Both of these findings independently qualify the tumor as **T3**. The tumor does not invade adjacent organs or major vessels, so it is not T4.\n\n**N (Regional Lymph Nodes):**\n- **N0:** No regional lymph node metastasis.\n- **N1:** Regional lymph node metastasis.\n\nThe problem states there are \"$2$ positive regional nodes\". For PNETs, the presence of any regional node metastasis, regardless of number, is classified as **N1**. The N2 category does not exist in the PNET staging system (it does for pancreatic adenocarcinoma).\n\n**M (Distant Metastasis):**\n- **M0:** No distant metastasis.\n- **M1:** Distant metastasis.\n\nThe staging workup \"confirms no distant metastasis\". Therefore, the classification is **M0**.\n\nCombining these components, the full TNM classification is **T3N1M0**.\n\n**Overall Stage Grouping:**\nBased on the AJCC 8th Edition for PNETs:\n- Stage I: T1 N0 M0\n- Stage IIA: T2 N0 M0\n- Stage IIB: T3 N0 M0\n- Stage IIIA: T4 N0 M0\n- **Stage IIIB: Any T, N1, M0**\n- Stage IV: Any T, Any N, M1\n\nThe patient's classification is T3N1M0. This falls into the **Stage IIIB** category.\n\n**2. Surgical Procedure**\n\nThe patient has a large ($5.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$), locally invasive (invading common bile duct) PNET located in the **pancreatic head**. The disease is not metastatic, and major vascular structures are not encased, indicating that a resection with curative intent is feasible.\n\n- **Enucleation:** This procedure involves shelling out the tumor from the surrounding pancreatic parenchyma. It is only suitable for small ($ 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$), superficial, benign or low-grade tumors that are not invading major structures like the pancreatic duct or common bile duct. It is absolutely contraindicated here due to the tumor's size and invasion of the bile duct.\n- **Distal Pancreatectomy:** This operation removes the body and tail of the pancreas and is indicated for tumors in those locations. It is geographically incorrect for a tumor in the pancreatic head.\n- **Total Pancreatectomy:** This is a highly morbid procedure removing the entire pancreas. It is not the standard primary approach for a resectable, unifocal tumor in the pancreatic head. It is reserved for specific circumstances, such as diffuse disease or the inability to obtain a negative margin with a lesser resection.\n- **Pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple Procedure):** This is the standard oncologic operation for malignant or large tumors of the pancreatic head. It involves the en bloc removal of the pancreatic head, duodenum, common bile duct, gallbladder, and associated regional lymph nodes. This procedure correctly addresses the primary tumor, the invaded common bile duct, and the involved regional lymph nodes. The goal of this surgery is to achieve negative microscopic margins (R0 resection).\n\nTherefore, the appropriate surgical procedure is a **pancreatoduodenectomy with regional lymphadenectomy**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $T3N1M0$; Stage IIIB; pancreatoduodenectomy with regional lymphadenectomy aiming for negative margins**\n- **Staging:** The TNM classification $T3N1M0$ and the overall Stage IIIB are precisely correct as derived above.\n- **Surgery:** Pancreatoduodenectomy with regional lymphadenectomy is the standard-of-care, curative-intent surgical procedure for this patient's tumor location, size, and local invasion. The stated goal of \"aiming for negative margins\" is a fundamental principle of oncologic surgery.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. $T4N2M0$; Stage III (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma schema); total pancreatectomy**\n- **Staging:** The T stage is incorrect; the tumor is $T3$, not $T4$, as it does not invade adjacent organs or major vessels. The N stage is incorrect; $N2$ is a category from the pancreatic adenocarcinoma staging system (for $\\ge 4$ positive nodes) and does not exist for PNETs. The correct PNET N stage is $N1$. The use of the adenocarcinoma schema is fundamentally wrong.\n- **Surgery:** Total pancreatectomy is not the indicated primary procedure.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $T2N1M0$; Stage II; enucleation of the pancreatic head lesion**\n- **Staging:** The T stage is incorrect; a $5.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ tumor that invades the bile duct is $T3$, not $T2$. The overall stage group is incorrect; $T3N1M0$ is Stage IIIB.\n- **Surgery:** Enucleation is a grossly inadequate and inappropriate surgical choice for a tumor of this size and invasive nature.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $T3N0M0$; Stage IIIA; distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy**\n- **Staging:** The N stage is incorrect; the patient has positive nodes, making the classification $N1$, not $N0$. The overall stage group is incorrect; $T3N1M0$ is Stage IIIB. (For reference, $T3N0M0$ would be Stage IIB).\n- **Surgery:** Distal pancreatectomy is the incorrect operation for a tumor in the pancreatic head.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. $T1N1M0$; Stage III; observation with somatostatin analog therapy alone**\n- **Staging:** The T stage is incorrect; a $5.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ tumor is $T3$, not $T1$. The stage grouping is vague and incorrect.\n- **Surgery/Management:** For a resectable, localized PNET, surgery is the only treatment with curative intent. Observation with somatostatin analogs is a non-curative approach reserved for unresectable or metastatic disease.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5163802"}, {"introduction": "While major anatomic resections remain the standard for many pancreatic malignancies, the principle of parenchyma preservation is critical for reducing surgical morbidity, particularly for the often indolent pNETs.

The provided data are coherent and consistent with established principles of pathology and oncology.\n\nThe task is to determine the optimal surgical strategy for a patient with a non-functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NF-PanNET) by integrating several key parameters. The fundamental principles governing this decision are the dual, and often conflicting, goals of achieving oncologic control and preserving organ function while minimizing surgical morbidity.\n\nA decision algorithm can be constructed as follows:\n1.  **Assess Indication for Intervention**: Determine if the tumor requires removal or can be observed.\n2.  **Evaluate for Parenchyma-Sparing Resection (Enucleation)**: Assess the technical feasibility and oncologic safety of enucleation.\n3.  **Default to Formal Anatomic Resection**: If enucleation is contraindicated, a formal resection is required.\n\n**Application of the Decision Algorithm to the Case:**\n\n**1. Indication for Intervention vs. Observation:**\nThe patient is $55$ years old and healthy. The tumor is $1.7\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ in diameter and, critically, is a World Health Organization (WHO) grade G2 tumor with a Ki-67 index of 7%. While observation may be considered for small (e.g., $ 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$) asymptomatic G1 NF-PanNETs, especially in high-risk surgical candidates, it is not the standard of care for a G2 tumor in a healthy, middle-aged patient. G2 tumors possess a significant potential for growth and metastasis. Therefore, surgical resection with curative intent is indicated.\n\n**2. Evaluation for Enucleation:**\nEnucleation is a parenchyma-sparing procedure that is attractive for small, benign, or low-grade malignant tumors as it avoids the high morbidity of a formal pancreatectomy. Its suitability is contingent upon two primary criteria: technical feasibility and oncologic adequacy.\n\n*   **Technical Feasibility (Proximity to Main Pancreatic Duct - MPD):**\n    Enucleation involves dissecting the tumor directly from the surrounding pancreatic parenchyma. This plane of dissection must not violate the MPD. A tumor located in close proximity to the duct poses a high risk of iatrogenic ductal injury, leading to a high-output, clinically significant postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF). A POPF is a major source of morbidity and potential mortality. A generally accepted threshold for safe enucleation is a tumor-to-duct distance of $\\ge 2-3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. In this case, the distance is $1.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, which is well below this safety margin. Attempting enucleation would carry a prohibitively high risk of injuring the MPD. This factor is a strong, and often absolute, contraindication for enucleation.\n\n*   **Oncologic Adequacy (Histologic Grade and Size):**\n    Enucleation is a local excision and does not include a regional lymphadenectomy. It is therefore oncologically appropriate only for tumors with a very low risk of lymph node metastasis. While the tumor is relatively small ($1.7\\,\\mathrm{cm}$), its G2 status is a significant concern. The Ki-67 index of 7% places it in the G2 category (defined as Ki-67 3-20%). The risk of lymph node metastasis for G2 NF-PanNETs, even those $ 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, is not negligible and can range from 10% to 30% in various series. While the Ga-68 DOTATATE PET-CT did not show nodal metastases, its sensitivity for micrometastatic disease is limited. Omitting a lymphadenectomy in a G2 tumor risks understaging and undertreating the patient.\n\n**3. Conclusion for Surgical Strategy:**\nBoth technical and oncologic factors argue against enucleation. The proximity to the MPD ($1.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) makes the procedure technically hazardous. The G2 grade makes the procedure oncologically questionable due to the risk of occult nodal disease. Therefore, a parenchyma-sparing approach is not appropriate. The correct strategy must be a formal anatomic resection. For a tumor in the pancreatic head, this procedure is a pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure). This operation allows for safe resection of the tumor with clear margins, controlled management of the transected pancreatic duct through a pancreatico-enteric anastomosis, and a complete regional lymphadenectomy for accurate pathologic staging and potential therapeutic benefit.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. Enucleation of the lesion alone, without duct manipulation**\nThis option is incorrect. As derived above, the distance of $1.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ between the tumor and the MPD creates an unacceptably high risk of ductal injury and subsequent severe pancreatic fistula. This violates the principle of minimizing surgical morbidity.\n\n**B. Enucleation with prophylactic MPD stenting to mitigate fistula risk**\nThis option is incorrect. Prophylactic stenting does not prevent ductal injury during a high-risk dissection. It is a damage control measure, not a primary preventative strategy for the injury itself. Acknowledging the high risk of ductal injury should lead to the selection of a safer primary operation (formal resection), not proceeding with a hazardous one with a plan for salvage.\n\n**C. Formal anatomic resection appropriate to location (pancreatoduodenectomy) with regional lymphadenectomy**\nThis option is correct. It directly addresses the contraindications to enucleation. A pancreatoduodenectomy allows for safe tumor removal despite its proximity to the MPD and provides a formal regional lymphadenectomy, which is necessary for accurate staging and optimal oncologic management of a G2 tumor. This is the standard of care given the combination of tumor location, proximity to the duct, and histologic grade.\n\n**D. Nonoperative observation with serial imaging every $6$ months**\nThis option is incorrect. Observation is not appropriate for a $1.7\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, G2 neuroendocrine tumor in a healthy $55$-year-old patient. The goal for such a lesion is curative resection, as the risk of malignant progression and metastasis is significant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "5163773"}]}
