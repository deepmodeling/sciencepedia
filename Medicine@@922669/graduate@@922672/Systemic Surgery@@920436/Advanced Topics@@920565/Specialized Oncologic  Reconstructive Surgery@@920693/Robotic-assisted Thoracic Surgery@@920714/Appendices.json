It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be generated.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a two-part response: a quantitative calculation of the end-effector displacement and a qualitative interpretation of the effect of motion scaling on precision.\n\n#### Part 1: Calculation of End-Effector Displacement\n\nThe relationship between the master controller's displacement magnitude, $|\\Delta x_{\\text{master}}|$, and the slave end-effector's displacement magnitude, $|\\Delta x_{\\text{slave}}|$, is given by the scaling factor $s$. The problem explicitly provides the formula:\n$$|\\Delta x_{\\text{slave}}| = \\frac{1}{s} |\\Delta x_{\\text{master}}|$$\nThe given values are:\n-   Master displacement magnitude, $|\\Delta x_{\\text{master}}| = 10 \\text{ mm}$.\n-   Motion scaling factor, $s = 5$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation yields the magnitude of the slave displacement:\n$$|\\Delta x_{\\text{slave}}| = \\frac{1}{5} \\times 10 \\text{ mm}$$\n$$|\\Delta x_{\\text{slave}}| = 2 \\text{ mm}$$\nThe problem requires the result to be expressed to four significant figures. The exact value is $2$. To represent this with four significant figures, we write it as $2.000$. The units are millimeters.\n\n#### Part 2: Qualitative Interpretation of Effect on Precision\n\nThe problem asks for an interpretation based on first principles of linear scaling and human motor variability.\n\nHuman motor control is inherently imperfect and includes components of unintentional motion, most notably physiological tremor. We can model the total motion of the surgeon's hand at the master controller, $\\Delta x_{\\text{master}}$, as the sum of an intended, purposeful motion, $\\Delta x_{\\text{intended}}$, and a small, random error motion, $\\delta x_{\\text{error}}$, which includes tremor.\n$$\\Delta x_{\\text{master}} = \\Delta x_{\\text{intended}} + \\delta x_{\\text{error}}$$\nThe robotic system's mapping is defined as linear. By the principle of superposition, which applies to linear systems, the scaling transformation acts on both components of the master input independently. The resulting motion of the slave end-effector, $\\Delta x_{\\text{slave}}$, is:\n$$\\Delta x_{\\text{slave}} = \\frac{1}{s} \\Delta x_{\\text{master}} = \\frac{1}{s} (\\Delta x_{\\text{intended}} + \\delta x_{\\text{error}})$$\n$$\\Delta x_{\\text{slave}} = \\frac{1}{s} \\Delta x_{\\text{intended}} + \\frac{1}{s} \\delta x_{\\text{error}}$$\nThis equation shows that both the intended motion and the error motion are scaled down by the factor $s$. For a scaling factor $s > 1$, as in this problem where $s = 5$, the motion is demagnified.\n\nThe direct implication for positional precision is that the magnitude of the surgeon's inherent motor error (tremor) is reduced at the end-effector. The magnitude of the error at the slave is $|\\delta x_{\\text{slave, error}}| = \\frac{1}{s} |\\delta x_{\\text{master, error}}|$. With $s = 5$, the amplitude of the tremor at the instrument tip is only one-fifth of the tremor at the surgeon's hand. This filtering of physiological tremor significantly enhances the positional precision and stability of the surgical instrument. It allows the surgeon to perform exceptionally fine and steady manipulations, such as dissecting delicate tissues near critical structures like the pulmonary artery, with a degree of steadiness that would be impossible with unassisted human hands. The trade-off is an increase in the required workspace for the surgeon's hands to produce a given tool-tip motion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.000}$$", "id": "5181532"}, {"introduction": "Successful thoracic surgery relies as much on meticulous preoperative planning as it does on intraoperative technique. A critical aspect of this planning is predicting the physiological consequences of lung resection to ensure the patient's safety and quality of life.

In preoperative planning for robotic-assisted thoracic surgery, a common physiologic assumption is that the Forced Expiratory Volume in $1$ second (FEV1) scales linearly with the fraction of functional lung preserved when resection removes whole bronchopulmonary segments. Assume the following foundational facts: the lungs comprise $19$ functional bronchopulmonary segments in total, segmental contributions are homogeneous at baseline, and the left lower lobe contains $4$ bronchopulmonary segments. The patient’s preoperative FEV1 is measured as $2.80$ liters with optimal effort and technique.\n\nUsing only the linear scaling assumption and conservation of functional units implied by segment counting, first derive a general expression for the predicted postoperative FEV1 (pFEV1) as a function of the preoperative FEV1 and the number of segments resected. Then, apply it to compute the pFEV1 for this planned left lower lobectomy. Express the final numerical result in liters and round to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in a simplified but standard clinical model, is well-posed, and provides all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a general expression for predicted postoperative Forced Expiratory Volume in $1$ second ($pFEV1$) and its subsequent calculation for a specific surgical case. The core principle is the linear scaling assumption, which states that FEV1 is directly proportional to the number of functional bronchopulmonary segments.\n\nLet's define the variables based on the problem statement:\n- $FEV1_{\\text{pre}}$: The preoperative FEV1.\n- $pFEV1$: The predicted postoperative FEV1.\n- $N_{\\text{total}}$: The total number of bronchopulmonary segments in both lungs.\n- $N_{\\text{resected}}$: The number of bronchopulmonary segments to be resected.\n- $N_{\\text{preserved}}$: The number of bronchopulmonary segments preserved post-surgery.\n\nThe assumption that \"segmental contributions are homogeneous at baseline\" implies that each of the $N_{\\text{total}}$ segments contributes an equal amount to the total preoperative FEV1. Let $C$ be the FEV1 contribution per segment. We can express the preoperative FEV1 as:\n$$FEV1_{\\text{pre}} = N_{\\text{total}} \\times C$$\n\nFrom this relationship, we can determine the contribution of a single segment, $C$, in terms of the measurable preoperative FEV1 and the total number of segments:\n$$C = \\frac{FEV1_{\\text{pre}}}{N_{\\text{total}}}$$\n\nAfter the surgical resection, the number of preserved, functional segments is:\n$$N_{\\text{preserved}} = N_{\\text{total}} - N_{\\text{resected}}$$\n\nThe predicted postoperative FEV1 ($pFEV1$) will be the sum of the contributions from the preserved segments. Since each preserved segment is assumed to contribute the same amount $C$ as it did preoperatively, the $pFEV1$ is given by:\n$$pFEV1 = N_{\\text{preserved}} \\times C$$\n\nTo derive the general expression for $pFEV1$ in terms of $FEV1_{\\text{pre}}$ and $N_{\\text{resected}}$, we substitute the expressions for $N_{\\text{preserved}}$ and $C$ into the equation for $pFEV1$:\n$$pFEV1 = (N_{\\text{total}} - N_{\\text{resected}}) \\times \\left( \\frac{FEV1_{\\text{pre}}}{N_{\\text{total}}} \\right)$$\n\nThis can be rearranged to provide the general expression requested in the first part of the task:\n$$pFEV1 = FEV1_{\\text{pre}} \\times \\frac{N_{\\text{total}} - N_{\\text{resected}}}{N_{\\text{total}}}$$\nThis equation formalizes the assumption that FEV1 scales linearly with the fraction of functional lung tissue preserved, where the fraction is $\\frac{N_{\\text{preserved}}}{N_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{total}} - N_{\\text{resected}}}{N_{\\text{total}}}$.\n\nNow, we apply this general expression to the specific case described in the problem. The given values are:\n- $FEV1_{\\text{pre}} = 2.80$ liters.\n- $N_{\\text{total}} = 19$ segments.\n- The procedure is a left lower lobectomy, which involves resecting the left lower lobe. The problem states this lobe contains $4$ segments, so $N_{\\text{resected}} = 4$.\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$pFEV1 = 2.80 \\times \\frac{19 - 4}{19}$$\n$$pFEV1 = 2.80 \\times \\frac{15}{19}$$\n\nNow we perform the numerical calculation:\n$$pFEV1 = 2.80 \\times \\frac{15}{19} = \\frac{42}{19} \\approx 2.2105263... \\text{ liters}$$\nThe problem requires the final numerical result to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $2.2105263...$. The first four significant figures are $2$, $2$, $1$, and $0$. The fifth significant figure is $5$, which requires rounding up the fourth significant digit. However, careful re-evaluation of the calculation $\\frac{42}{19}$ yields $2.2105263...$. The digit at the fourth significant position is $0$, and the following digit is $5$.
