A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation of the post-test probability of Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) following a positive test result proceeds from the fundamental definitions of probability and the parameters provided.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has CLI, and let $D^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have CLI. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive Duplex Ultrasonography (DUS) result, and $T^-$ be the event of a negative result.\n\nThe given information can be formally expressed in terms of conditional probabilities:\n1.  The pre-test probability, or prevalence, of CLI is $P(D) = \\pi$.\n2.  The probability of a patient not having CLI is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\pi$.\n3.  The sensitivity, $S$, is the probability of a positive test given that the disease is present: $S = P(T^+ | D)$.\n4.  The specificity, $C$, is the probability of a negative test given that the disease is absent: $C = P(T^- | D^c)$.\n\nThe objective is to find the post-test probability of CLI given a positive test result, which is denoted as $P(D | T^+)$. This is a conditional probability that can be calculated using Bayes' theorem.\n\nBayes' theorem states:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe numerator contains terms that are already defined: $P(T^+ | D) = S$ and $P(D) = \\pi$. The denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, which allows us to express $P(T^+)$ by conditioning on the presence or absence of the disease $D$:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nWe have the terms $P(T^+ | D) = S$, $P(D) = \\pi$, and $P(D^c) = 1 - \\pi$. The only remaining term to define is $P(T^+ | D^c)$, which is the probability of a positive test given that the disease is absent. This is also known as the false positive rate.\n\nThe false positive rate can be derived from the specificity, $C$. Specificity is $C = P(T^- | D^c)$. Since a patient without the disease can only have a positive or a negative test result, the sum of the probabilities of these two outcomes must be $1$:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) + P(T^- | D^c) = 1$$\nTherefore, the false positive rate is:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - C$$\n\nNow we can substitute all the components into the expression for the total probability $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (S)(\\pi) + (1 - C)(1 - \\pi)$$\n\nFinally, substituting the expressions for the numerator and the denominator into the Bayes' theorem formula for $P(D | T^+)$, we obtain the desired post-test probability:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}$$\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{S \\pi}{S \\pi + (1 - C)(1 - \\pi)}$$\n\nThis is the closed-form expression for the post-test probability of CLI after a positive DUS result, expressed as a function of the sensitivity $S$, specificity $C$, and prevalence $\\pi$.

This high stiffness creates a mechanical environment that, while potentially suitable for primary bone healing if the fracture ends were perfectly compressed, may be insufficient to stimulate the necessary callus formation for healing a segmental defect with a gap. This condition might risk a delayed union or atrophic non-union due to inadequate mechanical stimulation.\n\nThe circular frame results in a much higher strain ($\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{circ}} \\approx 4.2\\%$). This value falls squarely within the optimal range ($2\\%-10\\%$) for promoting fibrocartilage formation. This indicates that the circular frame provides a more favorable mechanical environment for stimulating secondary fracture healing through the development of a bridging callus, which is the desired healing pathway for a segmental diaphyseal fracture.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.06075}$$", "id": "5142998"}]}
