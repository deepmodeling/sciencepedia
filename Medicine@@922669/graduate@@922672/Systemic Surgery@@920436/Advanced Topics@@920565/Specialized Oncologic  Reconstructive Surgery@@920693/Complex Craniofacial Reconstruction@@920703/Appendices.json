After an initial latency phase, the distraction device is activated at a constant rate of $1$ millimeter per day. The distraction phase continues uninterrupted for $20$ days. In craniofacial distraction osteogenesis, the Tension-Stress principle asserts that under stable fixation and constant distraction, regenerate formation proceeds proportionally to applied displacement and time. Working from first principles, use the definition of a constant rate of change of regenerate length with respect to time to derive the expected regenerate length formed by the end of the distraction phase.

The final answer must consist of the two requested quantities only.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of two quantities related to mandibular distraction osteogenesis: the total regenerate bone length and the duration of the consolidation phase. The solution will be derived from first principles as stipulated.\n\nFirst, we address the formation of the regenerate bone. Let $L(t)$ represent the length of the regenerate bone in millimeters as a function of time $t$ in days. The distraction phase begins at $t=0$. At this initial time, the distraction process has not yet created any new bone, so the initial condition is $L(0) = 0$.\n\nThe problem states that the distraction device is activated at a constant rate. This rate is the rate of change of the regenerate length with respect to time. We are given this rate, $R$, as $1$ millimeter per day. In mathematical terms, this is expressed as a first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dt} = R\n$$\nwhere $R = 1 \\, \\frac{\\text{mm}}{\\text{day}}$.\n\nTo find the length $L(t)$ at any given time $t$ during the distraction phase, we must solve this differential equation subject to the initial condition $L(0)=0$. We can solve this by separation of variables and integration:\n$$\ndL = R \\, dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial state $(t=0, L=0)$ to a general state $(t', L(t'))$ gives:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L(t')} dL = \\int_{0}^{t'} R \\, dt\n$$\nSince $R$ is a constant, it can be moved outside the integral on the right-hand side:\n$$\n[L]_{0}^{L(t')} = R \\int_{0}^{t'} dt\n$$\n$$\nL(t') - L(0) = R [t]_{0}^{t'}\n$$\n$$\nL(t') - 0 = R (t' - 0)\n$$\nThis yields the equation for the regenerate length at any time $t'$ during the distraction phase:\n$$\nL(t') = R t'\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the distraction phase continues for a duration of $T_d = 20$ days. To find the total expected regenerate length, we evaluate $L(t')$ at $t' = T_d$. Let this final length be $L_{final}$.\n$$\nL_{final} = L(T_d) = R \\times T_d\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nL_{final} = \\left(1 \\, \\frac{\\text{mm}}{\\text{day}}\\right) \\times (20 \\, \\text{days}) = 20 \\, \\text{mm}\n$$\nThus, the expected regenerate length formed by the end of the distraction phase is $20$ millimeters.\n\nSecond, we compute the recommended consolidation time. The problem states a specific clinical protocol wherein the consolidation phase duration, let's call it $T_c$, is set to $3$ times the length of the distraction phase, $T_d$.\nThe relationship is given by:\n$$\nT_c = 3 \\times T_d\n$$\nGiven that the distraction phase duration is $T_d = 20$ days, we can calculate $T_c$:\n$$\nT_c = 3 \\times 20 \\, \\text{days} = 60 \\, \\text{days}\n$$\nTherefore, the recommended consolidation time is $60$ days.\n\nThe two requested quantities are the regenerate length in millimeters and the consolidation time in days, which are $20$ and $60$, respectively.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n20 & 60\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5103409"}, {"introduction": "The success of craniofacial reconstruction is measured not only by anatomical restoration but also by the preservation of function. This practice problem delves into the biomechanical consequences of orbital floor surgery, a common site for complex repairs.

The model provided approximates the eyeball (globe) as a perfect sphere of radius $R = 12 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ that rotates about its geometric center.\n\nThe core physical principle connecting the rotation of the globe to the muscle restriction is the relationship between a central angle and the arc length it subtends on the surface of the sphere. For a sphere of radius $R$, an angle of rotation $\\theta$ (in radians) corresponds to a shift of any point on the surface by an arc length $s$ according to the formula:\n$$s = R \\theta$$\nIn the context of extraocular muscle mechanics, when the eye rotates, the point of tangency between the muscle and the globe shifts. The muscle effectively \"slides\" over the scleral surface. The problem states that the inferior rectus muscle is restricted by an orbital implant at a specific point. This restriction is located at a posterior arc distance of $s = 10 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ from the muscle's tangent point on the globe when the eye is in primary gaze (looking straight ahead).\n\nUpgaze is an upward rotation of the eye. For the eye to rotate upwards, the inferior rectus muscle must relax and elongate, allowing the superior rectus muscle to pull the eye up. As the eye rotates upwards by an angle $\\theta$, the point of tangency of the inferior rectus muscle shifts posteriorly along the scleral surface. The problem states that the diplopia begins when this restriction is \"first reached during upgaze.\" This implies that the eye can rotate freely until the shifting point of muscle contact travels an arc distance equal to the distance from the primary position tangent point to the fixed implant restriction.\n\nLet $\\theta$ be the angle of upgaze at which the restriction is encountered. The arc length traversed by the point of tangency on the sclera during this rotation is equal to the given posterior arc distance, $s$.
