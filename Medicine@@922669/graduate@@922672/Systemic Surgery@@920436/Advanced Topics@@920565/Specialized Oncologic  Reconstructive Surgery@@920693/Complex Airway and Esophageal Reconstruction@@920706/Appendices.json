No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of viscous airway resistance in a stenotic segment to that in a normal segment, under the assumption of steady, incompressible, laminar flow. This physical situation is described by the Hagen-Poiseuille law.\n\nFirst, we must establish the relationship between pressure drop ($\\Delta P$), volumetric flow rate ($Q$), fluid properties, and the geometry of the conduit. For a Newtonian fluid with dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ undergoing steady laminar flow through a rigid cylindrical tube of length $L$ and internal radius $r$, the Hagen-Poiseuille equation states:\n$$\n\\Delta P = Q \\left( \\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r^4} \\right)\n$$\n\nThe concept of resistance, $R$, in a fluid circuit is defined as the ratio of the pressure drop across the circuit element to the volumetric flow rate through it. This is analogous to Ohm's law in electrical circuits.\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q}\n$$\n\nBy substituting the Hagen-Poiseuille expression for $\\Delta P$ into the definition of resistance, we can express the resistance $R$ of the cylindrical airway segment in terms of the fluid and geometric parameters, as requested by the first part of the problem.\n$$\nR = \\frac{1}{Q} \\left( Q \\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r^4} \\right) = \\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r^4}\n$$\nThis equation demonstrates that for laminar flow, resistance is directly proportional to the fluid viscosity $\\mu$ and segment length $L$, and inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius $r$.\n\nNext, we apply this formula to the two states described in the problem: the normal (pre-stenosis) state and the stenotic state. Let $R_0$ be the resistance of the normal segment with radius $r_0$, and let $R_1$ be the resistance of the stenotic segment with radius $r_1$.\n\nThe resistance of the normal segment is:\n$$\nR_0 = \\frac{8 \\mu_0 L_0}{\\pi r_0^4}\n$$\nThe resistance of the stenotic segment is:\n$$\nR_1 = \\frac{8 \\mu_1 L_1}{\\pi r_1^4}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that we are to assume the air dynamic viscosity and the segment length are unchanged between the two states. Therefore, we have $\\mu_1 = \\mu_0 = \\mu$ and $L_1 = L_0 = L$.\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio $R_1 / R_0$. Using the expressions for $R_1$ and $R_0$ with the stated assumptions:\n$$\n\\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{\\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r_1^4}}{\\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi r_0^4}}\n$$\n\nThe constant terms $\\frac{8 \\mu L}{\\pi}$ in the numerator and denominator cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n$$\n\\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{r_0^4}{r_1^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_0}{r_1}\\right)^4\n$$\nThis derivation shows that the resistance ratio is equal to the inverse fourth power of the radius ratio. This strong dependence on the radius is a critical principle in physiology and pathophysiology.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of this ratio using the given values for the radii: $r_0 = 6\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and $r_1 = 3\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n$$\n\\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\left(\\frac{6\\ \\mathrm{mm}}{3\\ \\mathrm{mm}}\\right)^4 = (2)^4\n$$\n$$\n(2)^4 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16\n$$\nThus, the viscous resistance of the stenotic segment is $16$ times greater than that of the normal tracheal segment, highlighting the dramatic physiologic impact of even a seemingly moderate reduction in airway radius.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{16}$$", "id": "5102993"}, {"introduction": "Following the decision to resect a stenotic segment, the surgeon's primary technical challenge is to achieve a tension-free primary anastomosis.

Preoperative planning anticipates a resection length of $4$ centimeters measured along the airway axis. Intraoperatively, three standard mobilization maneuvers are performed to reduce anastomotic tension through axial length gain: a suprahyoid release that yields $1.0$ centimeters, a thyrohyoid membrane release that yields $0.5$ centimeters, and an intrathoracic mobilization that yields $1.5$ centimeters. Assume the following fundamental base: (i) to achieve a tension-minimized primary end-to-end anastomosis, the distal and proximal tracheal ends must be apposed such that the post-mobilization residual gap equals the pre-resection approximation requirement minus the sum of axial length gains; (ii) axial length gains from independent releases combine linearly under small-strain assumptions; (iii) neck position is neutral with no contribution from flexion, and there is no viscoelastic creep during the time frame of anastomosis.\n\nUsing these principles, compute the residual anastomotic gap after the three releases are applied.

Principle (ii) states that the axial length gains from independent releases combine linearly. Therefore, the total axial length gain, denoted as $G_{total}$, can be calculated as the arithmetic sum of the individual gains:\n$$G_{total} = G_{supra} + G_{thyro} + G_{intra}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values into this equation:\n$$G_{total} = 1.0 \\text{ cm} + 0.5 \\text{ cm} + 1.5 \\text{ cm} = 3.0 \\text{ cm}$$\n\nNext, principle (i) defines the method for calculating the residual anastomotic gap, which we will denote as $G_{residual}$. It states that the residual gap is the difference between the \"pre-resection approximation requirement\" and the \"sum of axial length gains\". The pre-resection approximation requirement corresponds to the length of the resected segment, $L_{resection}$. The sum of axial length gains is $G_{total}$.\nTherefore, the governing equation for the residual gap is:\n$$G_{residual} = L_{resection} - G_{total}$$\n\nSubstituting the value for $L_{resection}$ and the calculated value for $G_{total}$:\n$$G_{residual} = 4 \\text{ cm} - 3.0 \\text{ cm} = 1.0 \\text{ cm}$$\nThe result of the calculation is a residual gap of $1.0$ cm.

The parameters are physically realistic for the specified biomedical application. The language is objective and unambiguous. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the circumferential (hoop) stress, $\\sigma_h$, in a thin-walled cylinder of internal radius $r$ and wall thickness $t$, subjected to an internal pressure $P$. The derivation must be based on a force balance on an axially cut half-cylinder of arbitrary length $L$.\n\nConsider a free-body diagram of a segment of the trachea of length $L$, cut in half along its longitudinal axis. The internal pressure $P$ acts radially outward, normal to the inner surface of the cylinder. The force exerted by this pressure tends to separate the two halves of the cylinder. For a static equilibrium analysis, we consider the components of this pressure force perpendicular to the cutting plane. The total force, $F_P$, due to the pressure is the pressure $P$ multiplied by the projected area onto which it acts. This projected area is a rectangle with dimensions $2r$ by $L$.\n$$\nF_P = P \\times (2rL)\n$$\nThis separating force must be balanced by the resisting force, $F_{\\sigma}$, generated by the hoop stress $\\sigma_h$ acting within the material of the cylinder wall.

Thus, the total area resisting the separation is $2tL$. The total resisting force is the hoop stress multiplied by this total area.\n$$\nF_{\\sigma} = \\sigma_h \\times (2tL)\n$$\nFor the system to be in static equilibrium, Newton's second law dictates that the sum of the forces must be zero. Therefore, the separating force must equal the resisting force.\n$$\nF_P = F_{\\sigma}\n$$\n$$\nP(2rL) = \\sigma_h(2tL)\n$$\nThe terms $2$ and $L$ are common to both sides and can be cancelled, simplifying the equation to:\n$$\nPr = \\sigma_h t\n$$\nSolving for the hoop stress, $\\sigma_h$, we obtain the well-known Barlow's formula for thin-walled cylinders:\n$$\n\\sigma_h = \\frac{Pr}{t}\n$$\nThis concludes the derivation part of the problem.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for the hoop stress.
