This allows us to treat the right-hand side as a constant and write the partial derivative as an ordinary derivative:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{J^{2}}{\\rho c \\sigma} $$\nTo find the total temperature rise, $\\Delta T = T(t_{\\mathrm{on}}) - T(0)$, we integrate this equation over the activation interval from $t=0$ to $t=t_{\\mathrm{on}}$:\n$$ \\int_{T(0)}^{T(t_{\\mathrm{on}})} dT = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{on}}} \\frac{J^{2}}{\\rho c \\sigma} dt $$\n$$ T(t_{\\mathrm{on}}) - T(0) = \\frac{J^{2}}{\\rho c \\sigma} \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{on}}} dt $$\n$$ \\Delta T = \\frac{J^{2} t_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\rho c \\sigma} $$\nThe problem defines a threshold condition where the temperature rise reaches the maximum allowable value, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{safe}}$, when the current density is at its threshold value, $J_{\\mathrm{th}}$.

This assumption is valid if the timescale of the heating, $t_{\\mathrm{on}}$, is much shorter than the characteristic time for thermal diffusion across the dimensions of the electrode. Equivalently, the thermal diffusion length, $\\ell_d$, which represents how far heat diffuses in time $t_{\\mathrm{on}}$, must be small compared to the characteristic size of the heating area (e.g., the electrode half-width, $L$).\n\nThe thermal diffusion length is given by $\\ell_{d} = \\sqrt{\\alpha t_{\\mathrm{on}}}$, where the thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$ is defined as $\\alpha = \\frac{k}{\\rho c}$.

A typical return electrode pad has dimensions of several centimeters, for example, $10\\,\\mathrm{cm} \\times 15\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. The characteristic half-width would be on the order of $5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ to $7.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ (i.e., $50\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ to $75\\,\\mathrm{mm}$). Since $\\ell_d \\approx 3.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is much smaller than these dimensions, the heat generated near the center of the pad does not have sufficient time to diffuse to the edges. Therefore, neglecting conduction (the adiabatic approximation) is a reasonable simplification for estimating the peak temperature rise.\n\n### Numerical Computations\n\nWe now compute the numerical values for $J_{\\mathrm{th}}$ and $A_{\\min}$ and round to four significant figures.\n\n**Threshold Current Density ($J_{\\mathrm{th}}$):**\nUsing the derived formula and given values:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(1100\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}) \\cdot (3300\\,\\mathrm{J/(kg\\cdot K)}) \\cdot (0.6\\,\\mathrm{S/m}) \\cdot (6\\,\\mathrm{K})}{90\\,\\mathrm{s}}} $$\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{th}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{13068000}{90}}\\,\\mathrm{A/m^{2}} = \\sqrt{145200}\\,\\mathrm{A/m^{2}} \\approx 381.05118\\,\\mathrm{A/m^{2}} $$\nRounding to four significant figures:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{th}} \\approx 381.1\\,\\mathrm{A/m^{2}} $$\n\n**Minimum Contact Area ($A_{\\min}$):**\nUsing the derived formula and the given $I_{\\mathrm{rms}} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{A}$ and the unrounded value of $J_{\\mathrm{th}}$ for better precision:\n$$ A_{\\min} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{rms}}}{J_{\\mathrm{th}}} = \\frac{2.5\\,\\mathrm{A}}{381.05118\\,\\mathrm{A/m^{2}}} \\approx 0.00656073\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}} $$\nRounding to four significant figures:\n$$ A_{\\min} \\approx 0.006561\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}} $$\nThis area corresponds to $65.61\\,\\mathrm{cm^{2}}$, which is a realistic size for a return electrode (e.g., an $8\\,\\mathrm{cm} \\times 8.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ pad).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n381.1 & 0.006561\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "5180662"}, {"introduction": "The safety of a robotic surgery platform depends not just on individual components, but on the reliability of the entire integrated system.

The probability of independent encoder failure is $p_{JI} = p_J(1-\\beta_J)$. We model the CCF term $p_{JC} = p_J\\beta_J$ as the probability of an event that causes all three encoders to fail.\nThe event $E_{enc}$ occurs if a CCF event happens, or if two encoders fail independently, or if all three fail independently. These are disjoint events under this model.\n$$P(E_{enc}) = p_{JC} + \\binom{3}{2} p_{JI}^2 (1-p_{JI}) + p_{JI}^3$$\nSimplifying, $P(E_{enc}) = p_{JC} + 3p_{JI}^2 - 3p_{JI}^3 + p_{JI}^3 = p_J\\beta_J + 3(p_J(1-\\beta_J))^2 - 2(p_J(1-\\beta_J))^3$.\nThe voter failure probability is $v = 8.0 \\times 10^{-4}$.\nThe subsystem failure probability is $P_{Joint} = P(E_{enc} \\cup E_v) = P(E_{enc}) + v - P(E_{enc})v$.\n$$P_{Joint} = \\left[p_J\\beta_J + 3(p_J(1-\\beta_J))^2 - 2(p_J(1-\\beta_J))^3\\right] + v - \\left[p_J\\beta_J + 3(p_J(1-\\beta_J))^2 - 2(p_J(1-\\beta_J))^3\\right]v$$\nNumerically:\n$p_{JI} = (5.0 \\times 10^{-4})(1 - 0.10) = 4.5 \\times 10^{-4}$\n$p_{JC} = (5.0 \\times 10^{-4})(0.10) = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}$\n$P(E_{enc}) = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5} + 3(4.5 \\times 10^{-4})^2(1 - 4.5 \\times 10^{-4}) + (4.5 \\times 10^{-4})^3$\n$P(E_{enc}) = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5} + 3(2.025 \\times 10^{-7})(0.99955) + 9.1125 \\times 10^{-11} \\approx 5.0 \\times 10^{-5} + 6.072 \\times 10^{-7} \\approx 5.0607 \\times 10^{-5}$\nA more precise calculation using the simplified formula:\n$P(E_{enc}) = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5} + 3(4.5 \\times 10^{-4})^2 - 2(4.5 \\times 10^{-4})^3 = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5} + 6.075 \\times 10^{-7} - 1.8225 \\times 10^{-10} = 5.0607481775 \\times 10^{-5}$\n$$P_{Joint} = 5.060748 \\times 10^{-5} + 8.0 \\times 10^{-4} - (5.060748 \\times 10^{-5})(8.0 \\times 10^{-4})$$\n$$P_{Joint} = 8.5060748 \\times 10^{-4} - 4.048598 \\times 10^{-8} = 8.50566995 \\times 10^{-4}$$\n\n**4. Overall Adverse Event Probability ($P_{AE}$)**\n\nCombining the subsystem probabilities:\n$P_{AE} = 1 - (1 - P_{Power})(1 - P_{Comm})(1 - P_{Joint})$\n$P_{AE} = 1 - (1 - 3.80322564 \\times 10^{-5})(1 - 1.10350639 \\times 10^{-3})(1 - 8.50566995 \\times 10^{-4})$\n$P_{AE} = 1 - (0.9999619677)(0.9988964936)(0.9991494330)$\n$P_{AE} = 1 - 0.9980088916 = 0.0019911084$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the overall adverse event probability is $0.001991$.\n\n**Dominant Risk Contributors**\n\nTo identify the dominant contributors, we compare the magnitudes of the subsystem failure probabilities:\n$P_{Power} \\approx 3.80 \\times 10^{-5}$\n$P_{Comm} \\approx 1.10 \\times 10^{-3}$\n$P_{Joint} \\approx 8.51 \\times 10^{-4}$\n\nThe total risk is approximately the sum of these probabilities, $P_{AE} \\approx 1.99 \\times 10^{-3}$. The Communications module and the Joint Encoder/Voter module are the dominant contributors, accounting for roughly $55\\%$ and $43\\%$ of the total risk, respectively. The Power module's contribution is minimal at about $2\\%$.\n\nThe reason for this dominance lies in the subsystem architectures. The minimal cut sets with the highest probabilities dictate the overall system risk.\n- In the Communications module, the redundant links have a combined failure probability $P(E_L) \\approx 1.04 \\times 10^{-4}$. However, the single arbitration controller has a failure probability of $a = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$. This single component failure is a minimal cut set and its probability is an order of magnitude larger than the redundant link failure, thus dominating $P_{Comm}$.\n- Similarly, in the Joint module, the TMR encoder system has a failure probability $P(E_{enc}) \\approx 5.06 \\times 10^{-5}$. The single voter has a failure probability $v = 8.0 \\times 10^{-4}$. The voter failure is a minimal cut set that dominates $P_{Joint}$.\n\nIn essence, the reliability of both the Communications and Joint modules is limited not by their redundant components but by their non-redundant series components (the controller and the voter), which act as single points of failure with relatively high failure probabilities.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.001991}$$", "id": "5180677"}]}
