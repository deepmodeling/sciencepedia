The terminology (flexion gap, resection, femoral component) and the surgical procedure described (resecting the posterior femoral condyles to adjust the flexion gap) are standard and factually correct in biomechanics and surgery. The geometric simplification to parallel planes is a common and valid modeling approach for this type of analysis. The given values are clinically realistic.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear initial state ($G_0 = 10$ mm), a specific action ($\\Delta r = 2$ mm resection), and a well-defined geometric model. It asks for a unique final state ($G_f$). The problem is self-contained and provides sufficient information to arrive at a deterministic solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free from subjectivity or opinion.\n- **Flaw Check**: The problem does not violate any of the specified flaw conditions. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, and well-posed. The core of the problem is a direct application of Euclidean geometry to a biomechanical model, which is a valid and non-trivial exercise in understanding the physical consequences of a surgical procedure.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires us to model the knee flexion gap at $90^{\\circ}$ as the Euclidean distance between two parallel planes. Let us establish a one-dimensional coordinate system along the axis normal to these planes, which we can call the $z$-axis.\n\nLet the tibial articulation plane, $P_T$, be fixed at the origin of this coordinate system. Its position is given by $z=0$.\n\nThe posterior femoral condylar tangent plane, $P_F$, is parallel to $P_T$. The initial flexion gap, $G_0$, is the normal distance between these two planes. Therefore, the initial position of the femoral plane $P_F$ is at $z_0 = G_0$.\nGiven the initial condition, we have:\n$$G_0 = 10 \\text{ mm}$$\n\nThe surgical procedure involves resecting an additional thickness of bone, $\\Delta r$, from the posterior femoral condyles. We are given:\n$$\\Delta r = 2 \\text{ mm}$$\nThe problem states that this resection is performed using a \"resection plane that is parallel to the tibial insert articulation plane\". This means the cut removes a layer of bone of uniform thickness $\\Delta r$, where the thickness is measured along the normal to the tibial plane (our $z$-axis).\n\nRemoving bone from the posterior femoral condyles moves the surface of the femur away from the tibial plane. The effect of this resection is to translate the femoral plane, $P_F$, in the positive $z$-direction by an amount equal to the thickness of the resected bone, $\\Delta r$.\n\nLet $G_f$ be the new, final flexion gap after the resection. This corresponds to the new position, $z_f$, of the translated femoral plane, which we can call $P_F'$. The translation relationship is:\n$$z_f = z_0 + \\Delta r$$\nSince the flexion gap is defined as the position of the femoral plane relative to the tibial plane at $z=0$, the new flexion gap $G_f$ is equal to $z_f$. Substituting $z_0 = G_0$, we get the general relationship for the new flexion gap:\n$$G_f = G_0 + \\Delta r$$\nThis equation represents the derived relationship requested by the problem. The change in the flexion gap, $\\Delta G = G_f - G_0$, is equal to the resection thickness, $\\Delta r$. This is a fundamental principle in gap balancing during knee arthroplasty: resecting $x$ mm of bone from the posterior femoral condyles increases the flexion gap by $x$ mm, assuming all other factors remain constant.\n\nNow, we compute the new flexion gap by substituting the given numerical values into the derived formula.\n$$G_0 = 10 \\text{ mm}$$\n$$\\Delta r = 2 \\text{ mm}$$\n\n$$G_f = 10 \\text{ mm} + 2 \\text{ mm}$$\n$$G_f = 12 \\text{ mm}$$\n\nThe new flexion gap after the additional $2$ mm resection from the posterior femoral condyles is $12$ mm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{12}$$", "id": "5103749"}, {"introduction": "Periprosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) is a devastating complication where diagnosis can be elusive, particularly in chronic, low-grade presentations.

No terms are ambiguous or subjective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A definitive solution can be derived by applying the specified criteria.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe diagnosis of PJI is to be determined using the $2018$ ICM scoring criteria for chronic PJI. A case is considered chronic as it presents $8$ months after the index arthroplasty, well beyond the $90$-day mark.\n\nThe ICM criteria first check for major criteria, which are diagnostic of PJI on their own:\n$1$. A sinus tract communicating with the joint. The problem states \"no sinus tract\". This criterion is not met.\n$2$. Two separate positive preoperative or intraoperative cultures with phenotypically identical organisms. The problem states \"cultures negative at $5$ days\". This criterion is not met.\n\nSince no major criteria are met, the point-based scoring system for minor criteria must be used. A total score of $\\ge 6$ is considered definitive for PJI. A score between $2$ and $5$ is inconclusive. A score of $<2$ makes PJI unlikely.\n\nLet us calculate the patient's score:\n\n1.  **Elevated Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) AND Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR):**\n    - The ICM threshold for CRP is $>10\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$ and for ESR is $>30\\,\\mathrm{mm/h}$.\n    - The patient's CRP is $22\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$ ($>10\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$).\n    - The patient's ESR is $48\\,\\mathrm{mm/h}$ ($>30\\,\\mathrm{mm/h}$).\n    - Since both are elevated, this criterion is met.\n    - **Score: $2$ points**\n\n2.  **Elevated Synovial Fluid White Blood Cell (WBC) Count:**\n    - The ICM threshold for a knee PJI is $>3000\\,\\mathrm{cells}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$.\n    - The patient's synovial WBC count is $4500/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$.\n    - This is greater than the threshold.\n    - **Score: $3$ points**\n\n3.  **Elevated Synovial Fluid Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil Percentage (PMN%):**\n    - The ICM threshold for a knee PJI is $>80\\%$.\n    - The patient's synovial PMN% is $85\\%$.\n    - This is greater than the threshold.\n    - **Score: $2$ points**\n\n4.  **Positive Alpha-Defensin (immunoassay):**\n    - The problem states the patient has a positive alpha-defensin test.\n    - **Score: $3$ points**\n\n5.  **Positive Leukocyte Esterase (LE):**\n    - The test was \"unreadable due to blood contamination\".\n    - No points can be awarded.\n    - **Score: $0$ points**\n\n6.  **Single Positive Culture:**\n    - Cultures were negative.\n    - **Score: $0$ points**\n\n7.  **Positive Histology / Purulence:**\n    - These are not available preoperatively in this case.\n    - **Score: $0$ points**\n\n**Total Calculated Score:**\nThe total score is the sum of the points from each criterion:\n$$ \\text{Total Score} = 2 (\\text{CRP/ESR}) + 3 (\\text{Synovial WBC}) + 2 (\\text{Synovial PMN\\%}) + 3 (\\text{Alpha-Defensin}) = 10 $$\nA score of $10$ is $\\ge 6$, which definitively establishes the diagnosis of **chronic PJI**.\n\nThe challenge now is that the cultures are negative. This is termed \"culture-negative PJI\". The primary goal shifts from establishing the diagnosis (which has been done) to identifying the causative organism to guide antibiotic apy.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Does not meet criteria for PJI; manage as aseptic failure and proceed to isolated polyethylene exchange without further infectious workup.**\n- **Evaluation:** The ICM score is $10$, which is well above the threshold of $6$ for diagnosing PJI. The statement \"Does not meet criteria for PJI\" is factually incorrect. Managing this case as an aseptic failure without treating the infection would almost certainly lead to failure of the revision surgery.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Meets criteria for chronic PJI; repeat synovial aspiration after withholding antibiotics for at least $2$ weeks with extended aerobic/anaerobic, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) cultures held up to $14$ days, and consider molecular diagnostics such as next-generation sequencing to identify the pathogen before finalizing the surgical plan.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option correctly states that the patient \"Meets criteria for chronic PJI\". The proposed next steps directly address the problem of culture-negative PJI. The patient has already been off antibiotics for $3$ weeks, satisfying the prerequisite. Repeating aspiration to obtain more sample for extended cultures ($14$ days) for slow-growing organisms, and specialized cultures for fungi and AFB, is the standard of care to increase diagnostic yield. Considering advanced molecular diagnostics like NGS is a modern and appropriate step when conventional cultures fail to identify a pathogen in a confirmed PJI case. This comprehensive approach is aimed at identifying the organism to enable targeted antibiotic therapy, which is crucial for successful treatment.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**C. Inconclusive for PJI by ICM scoring; obtain labeled leukocyte scintigraphy with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to establish the diagnosis before any further aspiration.**\n- **Evaluation:** The statement \"Inconclusive for PJI\" is incorrect. The ICM score of $10$ is definitive, not inconclusive (an inconclusive score is $2-5$). While labeled leukocyte scintigraphy can be used in ambiguous cases, it is not the next logical step here because the diagnosis has already been established by a more specific and standardized set of serological and synovial fluid criteria. The priority is now pathogen identification, not re-confirming the diagnosis with a less specific imaging modality.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Meets criteria for PJI; treat as an acute infection and proceed with urgent debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention (DAIR) within $2$ weeks to maximize success.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option correctly identifies that the patient meets the criteria for PJI. However, it incorrectly classifies the infection as \"acute\" and recommends DAIR. The patient's symptoms are progressive at $8$ months post-surgery, which defines a **chronic PJI**. DAIR is a procedure for acute postoperative (typically $<30$ days from surgery) or acute hematogenous ($<3$ weeks of symptoms) infections. Its success rate in chronic PJI is unacceptably low due to the presence of mature biofilm on the implant surfaces. The standard of care for chronic PJI is a full implant exchange, typically performed in two stages. Recommending DAIR for chronic PJI is a significant clinical error.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5103825"}, {"introduction": "Periprosthetic femoral fractures present a complex surgical problem where the treatment strategy is dictated by the stability of the implant.

The fracture line originates at the level of the femoral stem and extends into the diaphysis, without trochanteric involvement, consistent with a Vancouver type $B$ location by anatomy. Pre-injury leg length and stem position were documented at year $6$; current radiographs show a change in the vertical position of the stem shoulder relative to the lesser trochanter consistent with progressive subsidence of $4\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ since the prior radiograph. Proximal radiolucent lines are present in Gruen zones $1$ and $7$ with a width of $3\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, and there is endosteal scalloping of the proximal femur. A distal pedestal is visible at the stem tip with associated cortical hypertrophy. The femoral canal diameter at the isthmus is $19\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, and the outer femoral diameter at the same level is $30\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nIntraoperatively, after exposure and provisional fracture reduction, stem stability is tested.

Applying torsion of $3\\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$ yields visible toggling and measured rotational micromotion of $1.5^\\circ$. A fibrous membrane is noted at the proximal bone–implant interface. The distal stem appears well seated within the diaphysis without gross cortical perforation, and there is no segmental proximal femoral bone loss beyond areas of osteolysis. The acetabular component is well fixed.\n\nUsing established principles of osseointegration, load transfer, and bone remodeling, and the definitional basis of the Vancouver classification by stem stability and bone stock rather than fracture location alone, determine which classification and management strategy best fits this case. Consider the following facts as foundational starting points:\n\n- Osseointegration with stable bone ingrowth requires interface micromotion below approximately $50$–$150\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$; sustained micromotion above this range results in fibrous tissue rather than bone ingrowth.\n- Progressive stem subsidence, circumferential radiolucent lines greater than $2\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, distal pedestal formation with cortical hypertrophy, and endosteal osteolysis are recognized radiographic manifestations of proximal loosening in uncemented stems.\n- Wolff’s law dictates that bone adapts to load; distal cortical hypertrophy and pedestal formation reflect distal load transfer when proximal fixation is compromised.\n- The Vancouver classification defines $B_1$ as a fracture at the stem with a stable stem and adequate bone stock; $B_2$ as a fracture at the stem with a loose stem but adequate bone stock; and $B_3$ as a fracture at the stem with a loose stem and poor bone stock.\n\nCompute the cortical index at the isthmus from the given diameters and integrate this with the observed radiographic and intraoperative findings to select the most appropriate option.\n\nA.

Vancouver $B_3$: the stem is loose with poor bone stock; perform proximal femoral replacement due to insufficient bone for fixation.\n\nD. Vancouver $C$: the fracture is distal to the stem with a stable stem; treat with bridging fixation distal to the stem without stem revision.", "solution": "Begin with the fundamental requirements for osseointegration in uncemented femoral stems. Stable bone ingrowth requires interface micromotion below approximately $50$–$150\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$; micromotion exceeding this threshold leads to fibrous tissue formation instead of osseointegration. Radiographically, proximal loosening of an uncemented stem manifests as progressive subsidence, circumferential radiolucent lines wider than $2\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, distal pedestal formation with cortical hypertrophy, and proximal osteolysis from stress shielding and particulate-induced bone resorption. By Wolff’s law, distal cortical hypertrophy and pedestal formation indicate a shift of load transfer distally, consistent with loss of proximal fixation. The Vancouver classification assigns $B_1$ when the stem is stable (adequate fixation) and $B_2$ when the stem is loose but bone stock is adequate; $B_3$ adds poor bone stock. Classification is therefore determined by stem stability and bone stock rather than fracture location alone.\n\nCompute the cortical index at the isthmus to assess bone stock. The cortical index is defined as the ratio of total cortical thickness to overall diameter, often approximated by\n$$\n\\text{Cortical Index} = \\frac{D_{\\text{outer}} - D_{\\text{canal}}}{D_{\\text{outer}}},\n$$\nwhere $D_{\\text{outer}}$ is the outer femoral diameter and $D_{\\text{canal}}$ is the endosteal canal diameter. Substituting the given values,\n$$\n\\text{Cortical Index} = \\frac{30\\ \\mathrm{mm} - 19\\ \\mathrm{mm}}{30\\ \\mathrm{mm}} = \\frac{11}{30} \\approx 0.367.\n$$\nA cortical index of approximately $0.37$ suggests preserved diaphyseal bone stock; while proximal osteolysis exists, there is no segmental deficiency or severe thinning that would preclude diaphyseal fixation.\n\nNow interpret the radiographs. The stem has subsided $4\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ compared to prior imaging, exceeding typical thresholds for concerning migration in an uncemented stem. Proximal circumferential radiolucent lines of $3\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ in Gruen zones $1$ and $7$ indicate loosening. Distal pedestal formation and cortical hypertrophy signify distal load transfer, consistent with loss of proximal fixation. Endosteal scalloping reflects osteolysis. These radiographic signs together support proximal stem loosening.\n\nNext, integrate intraoperative findings. Under axial traction of $200\\ \\mathrm{N}$, the stem displaces $2\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ axially relative to the femur. Under torsion of $3\\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$, rotational micromotion of $1.5^\\circ$ is observed. Both displacements far exceed the micromotion threshold of $50$–$150\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ required for bone ingrowth, and visible toggling indicates a lack of mechanical stability of the bone–implant interface. The presence of a fibrous membrane at the proximal interface confirms fibrous fixation rather than osseointegration. Distal seating without cortical perforation suggests that the stem is supported distally but loose proximally. Bone stock remains adequate for diaphyseal fixation by the calculated cortical index and the absence of segmental loss.\n\nTherefore, by definition, the fracture is a Vancouver $B$ location with a loose stem and adequate bone stock, consistent with Vancouver $B_2$. Management should be stem revision to a diaphyseal-engaging long stem (with or without modular tapered fluted stem), along with fracture stabilization (cerclage cables and plate fixation as appropriate), rather than ORIF alone.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Treat as true Vancouver $B_1$: the stem is stable; perform ORIF without stem revision. This is incorrect. Radiographic evidence of progressive subsidence of $4\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, $3\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ proximal radiolucent lines, distal pedestal formation, and proximal osteolysis all indicate loosening. Intraoperative axial displacement of $2\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and rotational micromotion of $1.5^\\circ$ under applied loads far exceed the micromotion threshold for osseointegration, and a fibrous membrane is present. The stem is not stable; ORIF alone risks nonunion and failure.\n\nB. Misclassified as Vancouver $B_1$ preoperatively but actually Vancouver $B_2$: the stem is loose with adequate bone stock; perform stem revision with a diaphyseal-engaging long stem and fracture stabilization. This is correct. The defining criterion for $B_2$—a loose stem with sufficient bone stock—is met. The cortical index of approximately $0.37$ indicates adequate diaphyseal bone for fixation. Revision to a long diaphyseal-engaging stem with concurrent fracture fixation aligns with first principles of restoring implant stability and fracture biology.\n\nC. Vancouver $B_3$: the stem is loose with poor bone stock; perform proximal femoral replacement. This is incorrect. While the stem is loose, there is no segmental proximal femoral deficiency or severely compromised bone stock; the cortical index is approximately $0.37$, and distal diaphyseal bone appears adequate. Proximal femoral replacement is reserved for severe bone loss where standard fixation cannot be achieved.\n\nD. Vancouver $C$: the fracture is distal to the stem with a stable stem; treat with bridging fixation distal to the stem without stem revision. This is incorrect. The fracture originates at the level of the stem and extends into the diaphysis, classifying it as a Vancouver $B$ location, not $C$. Moreover, the stem is loose, contradicting the premise of a stable stem required for Vancouver $C$ management.\n\nIn summary, the fracture initially labeled as $B_1$ based on location is actually $B_2$ when correctly classified by stem stability and bone stock, necessitating stem revision and fracture stabilization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5103746"}]}
