A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem states that the chemodenervation effect $E$ (fractional reduction in platysma-generated depressor moment) follows a saturable single-site binding model. This can be described by an equation of the form:\n$$ E = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} \\cdot C}{K_{\\text{eff}} + C} $$\nwhere $E$ is the effect, $C$ is the local concentration of the neurotoxin at the neuromuscular junction, $E_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximal possible fractional reduction, and $K_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective concentration at which the effect is half-maximal.\n\nThe problem also states that the local concentration $C$ is proportional to the dose-to-muscle-mass ratio. We can express this as $C = k \\frac{D}{m}$, where $D$ is the dose, $m$ is the muscle mass, and $k$ is a proportionality constant. Substituting this into the binding equation yields:\n$$ E = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} \\cdot \\left(k \\frac{D}{m}\\right)}{K_{\\text{eff}} + \\left(k \\frac{D}{m}\\right)} $$\nWe can simplify this by dividing the numerator and denominator by $k$:\n$$ E = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} \\cdot \\frac{D}{m}}{\\frac{K_{\\text{eff}}}{k} + \\frac{D}{m}} $$\nLet us define a new constant, $K_D = K_{\\text{eff}}/k$. This constant $K_D$ represents the dose-to-mass ratio at which the effect is half-maximal and has units of dose per unit mass. Our dose-response model is thus:\n$$ E(D, m) = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}} \\cdot (D/m)}{K_D + (D/m)} $$\nWe have two unknown parameters, $E_{\\text{max}}$ and $K_D$. We can determine them using the two data points provided from prior sessions. Let $c = D/m$ be the dose-to-mass ratio.\n\nFor the first session:\n$D_1 = 20$ Units, $m_1 = 24 \\, \\mathrm{g}$, so $c_1 = \\frac{20}{24} = \\frac{5}{6} \\, \\mathrm{U/g}$.
