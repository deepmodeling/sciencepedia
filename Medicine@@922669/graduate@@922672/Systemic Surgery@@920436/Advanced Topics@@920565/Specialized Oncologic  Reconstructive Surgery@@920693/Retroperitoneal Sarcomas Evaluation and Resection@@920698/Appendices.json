Preoperative functional assessment includes an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) normalized to body surface area and a differential renal scintigraphy quantifying the fractional contribution of each kidney to total filtration under current conditions. Use the following scientifically grounded premises as the fundamental base: total glomerular filtration is the sum of contributions from each kidney, removal of one kidney eliminates its contribution, and surviving kidney function can adapt by physiologic hyperfiltration (compensation) that is classically modeled as a multiplicative increase over its baseline contribution, attenuated by comorbid factors that limit adaptive capacity.\n\nData:\n- Baseline estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) is $E_{0} = 84 \\,\\mathrm{mL/min/1.73\\,m^2}$.\n- The differential study indicates the right kidney contributes a fraction $f_{R} = 0.40$ of the baseline eGFR, and the left kidney contributes $f_{L} = 0.60$ of the baseline eGFR.\n- In the absence of limiting comorbidity, the contralateral kidney is expected to increase its filtration by a fractional compensation $c_{\\mathrm{norm}} = 0.30$ over its baseline contribution by $12$ weeks after unilateral nephrectomy.\n- The patient has diabetes mellitus and chronic vascular changes that attenuate compensation by a fractional attenuation $a = 0.25$, applied multiplicatively to $c_{\\mathrm{norm}}$.\n\nAssuming the compensation model applies at $12$ weeks postoperatively and body surface area normalization remains constant, compute the expected postoperative eGFR after right nephrectomy.

The calculation will proceed by determining the function of the remaining kidney and modeling its compensatory increase.\n\n1.  **Determine the baseline function of the remaining (left) kidney.**\nThe total baseline eGFR is given as $E_{0} = 84 \\,\\mathrm{mL/min/1.73\\,m^2}$. The left kidney contributes a fraction $f_{L} = 0.60$ to this total. Therefore, the baseline eGFR of the left kidney, denoted as $E_{L}$, is:\n$$E_{L} = E_{0} \\times f_{L}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E_{L} = 84 \\times 0.60 = 50.4 \\,\\mathrm{mL/min/1.73\\,m^2}$$\n\n2.  **Model the postoperative compensation.**\nAfter the right nephrectomy, the left kidney is the sole source of renal function. It is expected to undergo compensatory hyperfiltration. The model states that this compensation is a fractional increase over its baseline contribution. The normal fractional compensation is $c_{\\mathrm{norm}} = 0.30$. However, this is attenuated by the patient's comorbidities. The fractional attenuation is given as $a = 0.25$. The problem states this attenuation is \"applied multiplicatively to $c_{\\mathrm{norm}}$\". The standard interpretation of a fractional attenuation of $a$ is a reduction by that fraction, which corresponds to multiplication by a factor of $(1-a)$. Therefore, the effective fractional compensation, $c_{\\text{eff}}$, is:\n$$c_{\\text{eff}} = c_{\\mathrm{norm}} \\times (1 - a)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$c_{\\text{eff}} = 0.30 \\times (1 - 0.25) = 0.30 \\times 0.75 = 0.225$$\nThis means the left kidney's function will increase by $22.5\\%$ of its own baseline value.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total postoperative eGFR.**\nThe final postoperative eGFR, $E_{\\text{post}}$, is the baseline function of the left kidney plus the compensatory increase.\n$$E_{\\text{post}} = E_{L} + (\\text{compensatory increase})$$\nThe compensatory increase is the baseline function of the left kidney, $E_{L}$, multiplied by the effective compensation fraction, $c_{\\text{eff}}$.\n$$E_{\\text{post}} = E_{L} + (E_{L} \\times c_{\\text{eff}}) = E_{L} \\times (1 + c_{\\text{eff}})$$\nWe can write a single expression for $E_{\\text{post}}$ in terms of the initial givens:\n$$E_{\\text{post}} = (E_{0} \\times f_{L}) \\times (1 + c_{\\mathrm{norm}}(1 - a))$$\n\n4.  **Compute the final numerical value.**\nUsing the intermediate values calculated above:\n$$E_{\\text{post}} = 50.4 \\times (1 + 0.225)$$\n$$E_{\\text{post}} = 50.4 \\times 1.225$$\n$$E_{\\text{post}} = 61.74 \\,\\mathrm{mL/min/1.73\\,m^2}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

There is loss of the intervening fat plane at the root entry zone and segmental nerve caliber asymmetry compared to the contralateral side. There is no evidence of distant metastasis on chest imaging. Image-guided core-needle biopsy reveals high-grade Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma (UPS). The patient’s baseline neurological examination is normal, with Medical Research Council (MRC) grade $5/5$ strength in hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion, and intact sensation in L2–L5 dermatomes. Intraoperative neuromonitoring resources and vascular reconstruction capability are available. The patient seeks a plan that prioritizes oncologic control but also wishes to understand functional consequences. Radiation Therapy (RT) and chemotherapy are available but the patient has no contraindications to surgery.\n\nUsing only fundamental oncologic surgery principles for soft-tissue sarcoma—namely en bloc resection, avoidance of tumor violation, and the primacy of negative microscopic margins (R0) for local control—along with neuroanatomic principles of the lumbosacral plexus, choose the operative plan that best balances oncologic control and function when the tumor abuts and radiographically likely invades the psoas and the L4 component of the lumbosacral plexus.

Stage the operation: perform initial debulking of the exophytic tumor portion to reduce mass effect and reassess nerve involvement on interval imaging; if regrowth occurs despite RT, then consider nerve sacrifice at a second operation.\n\nE. Defer surgery because functional loss from L4 sacrifice is unacceptable; treat with definitive RT alone, reserving surgery only for symptomatic progression.", "solution": "The decision must be derived from core oncologic principles for soft-tissue sarcoma and from neuroanatomic-functional reasoning. The fundamental starting points are:\n\n- In sarcoma surgery, en bloc resection with negative microscopic margins (R0) reduces the residual tumor cell count adjacent to the resection bed to $N=0$, whereas an R1 resection leaves $N>0$ microscopic residual disease at the cut surface. Given that local recurrence probability increases monotonically with residual viable tumor cells, R0 resections are strongly associated with improved local control in retroperitoneal sarcoma.\n- Avoidance of tumor violation and piecemeal resection is required to prevent seeding and to maintain the integrity of fascial or visceral barriers that function as anatomic margins.\n- For lumbosacral plexus involvement, radiographic hallmarks such as circumferential contact greater than $180^\\circ$, loss of intervening fat plane, and segmental nerve caliber change correlate with a high likelihood of true neural invasion rather than mere displacement. In the presence of invasion, “peeling” a tumor off a nerve is intralesional and risks an R1/R2 margin.\n- Functionally, the L4 root contributes significantly to the femoral nerve and quadriceps strength (knee extension). Sacrifice of L4 will predictably reduce knee extension strength; however, with intact L2–L3 contributions, some patients ambulate with assistive devices, bracing, and rehabilitation. The functional cost, while meaningful, is not uniformly prohibitive.\n- Radiation Therapy (RT) can reduce local recurrence risk in selected settings but does not sterilize gross or microscopic disease at a positive margin along critical structures and cannot reliably convert an R1 into the oncologic equivalent of an R0 resection. Similarly, chemotherapy response in high-grade Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma (UPS) is variable and is not a reliable method to eliminate perineural or intraneural invasion; even dimensional shrinkage does not equate to clearance of microscopic invasion.\n- Retroperitoneal sarcomas are predominantly controlled by local therapy; when technically feasible with acceptable morbidity, R0 resection should be prioritized over nerve preservation that leaves positive margins.\n\nApplying these principles to the case:\n\n- The MRI suggests more than $180^\\circ$ encasement of L4 over $3\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ with loss of fat plane and caliber change, indicating a high probability of neural invasion. Attempting to preserve the nerve at the expense of margins would be intralesional.\n- Given high-grade UPS and absence of metastasis, achieving local control is central to disease-specific outcome. Sacrificing the involved L4 root to obtain an R0 margin aligns with en bloc principles. Functional counseling is essential, and postoperative rehabilitation plus bracing can mitigate disability.\n- RT may be considered selectively for close margins where safe re-excision is not feasible, but it is not a substitute for a negative margin at the nerve interface.\n- Debulking or staging strategies that violate en bloc principles increase the risk of seeding and do not improve oncologic control.\n- Definitive RT alone in a resectable, high-grade lesion with potential for R0 resection is not standard because it leaves gross disease (R2), with $N \\gg 0$ residual cells, and inferior durable local control compared with surgery.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Proceed with en bloc resection of the tumor with segmental psoas resection and sacrifice of the involved L4 root to achieve R0, with counseling and rehabilitation, and consider adjuvant RT only if final margins are close. This directly follows the principle that when a critical structure is truly invaded, en bloc resection including that structure to achieve R0 is indicated. It explicitly addresses the trade-off: it accepts predictable functional deficit from L4 sacrifice in exchange for elimination of microscopic residual disease ($N=0$) at the nerve margin, which is paramount in high-grade retroperitoneal sarcoma. The mention of adjuvant RT for close but negative margins at other critical interfaces is reasonable and not a substitute for negative margins at the nerve. Correct.\n\nB. Perform an epineural dissection to preserve L4, accepting an R1 margin along the nerve and then give high-dose RT. This plan intentionally leaves $N>0$ tumor cells along the nerve and relies on RT to compensate. RT cannot reliably sterilize an R1 interface in this setting, particularly when imaging suggests invasion, and local recurrence risk remains unacceptably high. This violates the primacy of R0 margins in high-grade disease. Incorrect.\n\nC. Give neoadjuvant chemotherapy to shrink the tumor away from the nerve and, if a $30\\%$ reduction in contact length occurs, perform a marginal resection. Chemotherapy response in high-grade UPS is variable and even a dimensional response does not ensure clearance of perineural or intraneural invasion; a marginal resection after “shrinkage” still risks R1/R2 disease. This approach substitutes an unreliable surrogate (radiographic shrinkage of contact length) for the oncologic requirement of negative margins. Incorrect.\n\nD. Stage the operation with initial debulking and reassessment, adding RT, and only later consider nerve sacrifice. Debulking is piecemeal resection that violates en bloc principles and risks tumor spill, increasing the residual tumor burden ($N$ increases or remains $>0$) and compromising future control. Incorrect.\n\nE. Defer surgery and deliver definitive RT alone to avoid L4 deficits. In a resectable, high-grade retroperitoneal sarcoma without metastasis, definitive RT alone leaves gross residual disease (R2), with high local failure rates compared with R0 surgery. Prioritizing function by abandoning resection does not align with oncologic principles when acceptable-morbidity R0 resection is feasible. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the strategy that most appropriately balances oncologic control and function, consistent with first principles, is en bloc resection with L4 root sacrifice to achieve a negative margin, with thorough counseling and rehabilitation planning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5180270"}, {"introduction": "Completing a successful R0 resection is a major milestone, but the management of a high-grade retroperitoneal sarcoma extends into long-term surveillance. An effective follow-up strategy must be risk-adapted, taking into account the tumor's grade and histology, which dictate the likely patterns and timing of recurrence. This practice problem challenges you to design an evidence-based surveillance protocol for a high-risk patient, balancing the need for early detection of recurrence with the cumulative costs and exposures of imaging [@problem_id:5180345].", "problem": "A $62$-year-old patient underwent complete (negative margin) resection of a retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma (LMS) confirmed to be high grade on final pathology. There is no residual disease on immediate postoperative staging. The patient has normal renal function, no contraindication to iodinated contrast, and is otherwise fit for repeated imaging. The multidisciplinary team must design a surveillance plan that is risk-adapted by histology and grade and balances early detection of treatable recurrence with cumulative radiation exposure and cost.\n\nUse the following foundational principles:\n- In retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS), the time-dependent hazard of recurrence after complete resection is highest in the early postoperative interval, especially for high-grade histologies, and then declines over time. This motivates more frequent imaging early (short-interval surveillance) followed by lengthening intervals as the hazard decreases.\n- Patterns of failure in RPS are histology-specific. Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) has a substantial risk of hematogenous metastasis, particularly to the lungs and liver, in addition to risk of local recurrence. Well-differentiated liposarcoma, by contrast, rarely metastasizes and predominantly recurs locally, often late.\n- Imaging modality choice should align with an organ’s dominant failure mode and with test performance: computed tomography (CT) of the chest is superior to chest radiography for detecting small pulmonary metastases; contrast-enhanced CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis are appropriate for local-site surveillance, with CT generally preferred when contrast is safe and readily available.

The language is objective and precise. The problem contains no scientific inaccuracies, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived by applying the given principles to the patient's specific case.\n\n**Derivation of the Optimal Surveillance Strategy**\nBased on the provided information and principles, we can construct the ideal surveillance plan for this patient.\n\n1.  **Patient Risk Stratification**: The patient has a high-grade retroperitoneal LMS. The \"high grade\" designation places the patient in a high-risk category for recurrence. The \"LMS\" histology indicates a high propensity for both local recurrence and distant, hematogenous metastases, particularly to the lungs and liver (Principle 2).\n\n2.  **Choice of Imaging Modality**:\n    -   **Local and Hepatic Surveillance (Abdomen/Pelvis)**: Given the risk of local recurrence and liver metastases, high-quality cross-sectional imaging of the abdomen and pelvis is required. The patient has normal renal function and no contraindications to iodinated contrast. Therefore, according to Principle 3, contrast-enhanced CT is the preferred modality.\n    -   **Pulmonary Surveillance (Chest)**: Given the substantial risk of lung metastases for LMS, effective chest surveillance is critical. Principle 3 explicitly states that CT of the chest is superior to chest radiography for detecting small pulmonary nodules. Therefore, chest CT is the required modality.\n    -   **Combined Modality**: The most efficient and comprehensive approach is a contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.\n    -   **Role of PET**: Principle 3 rules out routine PET-CT as a primary surveillance tool.\n\n3.  **Frequency and Duration of Surveillance**:\n    -   Principle 1 dictates that for high-grade tumors, the surveillance frequency should be highest initially and decrease over time. The highest risk of recurrence is within the first $2$ to $3$ years post-resection.\n    -   Therefore, an appropriate schedule would involve imaging at short intervals (e.g., every $3$ to $6$ months) for the first $2$ to $3$ years.\n    -   As the time from surgery increases and the hazard rate declines, the interval can be lengthened (e.g., to every $6$ months, then annually).\n    -   Surveillance is typically continued for an extended period, such as $10$ years, as late recurrences, while less common, can still occur.\n\n**Summary of the Ideal Plan**: The optimal strategy involves contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed every $3$–$6$ months for the first $2$–$3$ years, followed by a gradual tapering of frequency to every $6$ months and then annually, for a total duration of up to $10$ years.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Annual abdominal and pelvic MRI with gadolinium and annual non-contrast chest radiography for $5$ years, then stop if no recurrence.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option employs chest radiography, which is explicitly noted as an inferior modality for detecting pulmonary metastases (violates Principle 3). Furthermore, the surveillance frequency is only annual from the start, which is insufficient for a high-risk, high-grade sarcoma in the early, highest-risk period (violates Principle 1). Stopping all surveillance at $5$ years is also questionable for a high-grade tumor.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**B. Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis every $3$–$4$ months for the first $2$–$3$ years, then every $6$ months until year $5$, then annually until year $10$.**\n-   **Analysis**: This strategy aligns perfectly with the derived ideal plan.\n    -   **Modality**: It uses contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which is the optimal choice based on Principles 2 and 3 and the patient's clinical status.\n    -   **Frequency and Duration**: The schedule—frequent imaging every $3$–$4$ months during the highest-risk period ($2$–$3$ years), followed by tapering to every $6$ months and then annually up to year $10$—is a direct and correct application of Principle 1.\n-   **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**C. Whole-body PET-CT every $3$ months indefinitely, with no dedicated chest CT.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option relies on PET-CT as the primary surveillance tool. Principle 3 explicitly states that PET is not a routine surveillance tool for this purpose. The schedule of \"every $3$ months indefinitely\" also fails to incorporate the concept of lengthening intervals as the hazard of recurrence declines over time (violates Principles 1 and 3).\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis every $6$ months for the first $2$ years, chest imaging only by radiography annually, then abdominal and pelvic CT annually thereafter with no chest imaging beyond year $3$.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option has several critical flaws. It uses suboptimal chest radiography instead of CT (violates Principle 3). It only performs chest imaging annually, which is too infrequent. Most severely, it ceases all chest surveillance after year $3$, completely ignoring the ongoing risk of pulmonary metastases, which is a primary failure pattern for LMS (violates Principle 2).\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. Non-contrast CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis every $12$ weeks for the first $5$ years, then every $2$ years thereafter indefinitely.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option proposes non-contrast CT. Since the patient has no contraindication to contrast, this is a suboptimal choice, particularly for assessing local recurrence and liver metastases where contrast enhancement is critical for characterization (violates the preference stated in Principle 3). Additionally, maintaining a high-frequency interval of every $12$ weeks for a full $5$ years, without tapering, is not consistent with the principle of adapting to the declining hazard rate over time (violates Principle 1). This would lead to excessive radiation exposure without clear benefit over a tapered schedule.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5180345"}]}
