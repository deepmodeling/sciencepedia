A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe primary tumor ($T$) classification for cutaneous melanoma, according to the AJCC $8$th edition staging manual, is determined by two key histopathological features: the tumor's Breslow thickness (maximum vertical thickness) and the presence or absence of ulceration.\n\nThe $T$ categories are defined as follows based on Breslow thickness:\n- $T1$: Thickness $\\le 1.0\\,\\text{mm}$\n- $T2$: Thickness $> 1.0$ to $\\le 2.0\\,\\text{mm}$\n- $T3$: Thickness $> 2.0$ to $\\le 4.0\\,\\text{mm}$\n- $T4$: Thickness $> 4.0\\,\\text{mm}$\n\nEach $T$ category (from $T1$ to $T4$) is further subcategorized by a suffix:\n- Suffix 'a': Indicates the absence of ulceration.\n- Suffix 'b': Indicates the presence of ulceration.\n\nNote: The $T1$ category has a more complex subclassification involving a thickness cutoff at $0.8\\,\\text{mm}$ and mitotic rate, but this is not relevant to the current problem as the thickness is $2.4\\,\\text{mm}$.\n\nApplying the given data to this classification system:\n1.  The reported Breslow thickness is $2.4\\,\\text{mm}$.\n2.  This thickness value satisfies the condition $> 2.0$ to $\\le 4.0\\,\\text{mm}$. Therefore, the primary tumor category is $T3$.\n3.  The histopathology report \"explicitly notes the absence of surface ulceration.\"\n4.  The absence of ulceration corresponds to the 'a' suffix.\n5.  Combining the tumor category and the ulceration suffix yields the final classification: $T3a$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $T2a$**\nThis classification corresponds to a Breslow thickness of $> 1.0$ to $\\le 2.0\\,\\text{mm}$ and the absence of ulceration. The patient's tumor has a thickness of $2.4\\,\\text{mm}$, which falls outside of this range.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. $T3a$**\nThis classification corresponds to a Breslow thickness of $> 2.0$ to $\\le 4.0\\,\\text{mm}$ and the absence of ulceration. The patient's tumor has a thickness of $2.4\\,\\text{mm}$, which is within this range, and ulceration is absent. This matches the derived classification.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. $T3b$**\nThis classification corresponds to a Breslow thickness of $> 2.0$ to $\\le 4.0\\,\\text{mm}$, which is consistent with the patient's $2.4\\,\\text{mm}$ thickness. However, the 'b' suffix indicates the presence of ulceration. The problem statement explicitly specifies the absence of ulceration.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $T4a$**\nThis classification corresponds to a Breslow thickness of $> 4.0\\,\\text{mm}$ and the absence of ulceration. The patient's tumor has a thickness of $2.4\\,\\text{mm}$, which is not greater than $4.0\\,\\text{mm}$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5107595"}, {"introduction": "Once the primary tumor is staged, the focus shifts to assessing regional disease, which is codified in the $N$ category.

It requires the application of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Eighth Edition staging manual for cutaneous melanoma, a standard and objective framework in clinical oncology. All scenarios provide sufficient, non-contradictory information to arrive at a definitive answer.\n\nThe task is to determine the correct regional lymph node ($N$) category for three distinct clinical scenarios according to the AJCC Eighth Edition criteria. The absence of distant metastases ($M0$) is given for all cases. The staging of regional disease in melanoma depends on the number of involved nodes, whether they were detected clinically or pathologically (clinically occult), and the presence or absence of in-transit, satellite, or microsatellite metastases.\n\nLet us define the pertinent AJCC Eighth Edition $N$ categories for cutaneous melanoma:\n- **$N0$**: No regional lymph node metastases detected.\n- **$N1$**: One tumor-involved node OR any number of in-transit, satellite, and/or microsatellite metastases with no tumor-involved nodes.\n    - $N1a$: One clinically occult node (e.g., detected by sentinel lymph node biopsy, SLNB).\n    - $N1b$: One clinically detected node.\n    - $N1c$: No regional node disease but presence of in-transit, satellite, or microsatellite metastases.\n- **$N2$**: Two or three tumor-involved nodes OR any of the $N1$ findings with one tumor-involved node.\n    - $N2a$: Two or three clinically occult nodes.\n    - $N2b$: Two or three clinically detected nodes.\n    - $N2c$: One clinically occult or detected node plus in-transit, satellite, or microsatellite metastases.\n- **$N3$**: Four or more tumor-involved nodes, or matted nodes, or any of the $N1$ findings with two or more tumor-involved nodes.\n    - $N3a$: Four or more clinically occult nodes.\n    - $N3b$: Four or more clinically detected nodes or any number of matted nodes.\n    - $N3c$: Two or more nodes (occult or detected) or matted nodes, plus in-transit, satellite, or microsatellite metastases.\n\nWe will now apply these definitions to each scenario.\n\n**Scenario X Analysis:**\n- **Givens:** The patient is clinically node-negative. A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) reveals a single ($1$) sentinel node with a microscopic metastatic focus. There are no in-transit, satellite, or microsatellite lesions.\n- **Derivation:** The term \"clinically node-negative\" combined with a positive SLNB signifies that the nodal metastasis was \"clinically occult.\" The finding of a single ($1$) involved node that is clinically occult maps directly to the definition of the $N1a$ subcategory.\n- **Conclusion for X:** The correct category is $N1a$.\n\n**Scenario Y Analysis:**\n- **Givens:** The patient presents with palpable adenopathy, which is confirmed by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) to be metastatic melanoma. A subsequent lymph node dissection yields exactly two ($2$) involved nodes. There are no in-transit, satellite, or microsatellite lesions.\n- **Derivation:** The presence of palpable, pathologically confirmed nodal disease means the metastasis is \"clinically detected.\" The total number of involved regional nodes is two ($2$). According to the AJCC criteria, two or three ($2-3$) clinically detected nodes without in-transit/satellite/microsatellite disease corresponds to the $N2b$ subcategory.\n- **Conclusion for Y:** The correct category is $N2b$.\n\n**Scenario Z Analysis:**\n- **Givens:** The patient has multiple in-transit metastases. However, SLNB and imaging show no nodal metastasis.\n- **Derivation:** In-transit metastases are a form of regional disease, classified under the $N$ category.

For this problem, both patients have $M0$, indicating regional disease (Stage $III$) or localized disease (Stage $I$ or $II$), but not distant metastatic disease (Stage $IV$).\n\n**Patient 1: $T2aN1aM0$**\n*   Primary Tumor ($T$): $T2a$ signifies a tumor thickness between $1.01\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $2.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ without ulceration.\n*   Regional Nodes ($N$): $N1a$ signifies one clinically occult (microscopic) metastatic lymph node.\n*   Distant Metastasis ($M$): $M0$ signifies no evidence of distant metastasis.\n\nAccording to the AJCC $8^\\text{th}$ edition pathologic staging table, the stage group is determined by the combination of $T$, $N$, and $M$. Any nodal involvement ($N>0$) with no distant metastasis ($M0$) results in Stage $III$. The specific subgroup is determined as follows:\n- Stage $IIIA$ is defined for the combinations ($T1a/b$ or $T2a$) and ($N1a$ or $N2a$), with $M0$.\nThe patient's classification, $T2aN1aM0$, fits squarely within this definition.\nTherefore, Patient $1$ is **Stage $IIIA$**.\n\n**Patient 2: $T4bN3cM0$**\n*   Primary Tumor ($T$): $T4b$ signifies a tumor thickness greater than $4.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ with ulceration.\n*   Regional Nodes ($N$): $N3c$ signifies the presence of in-transit, satellite, and/or microsatellite metastases combined with any number of metastatic lymph nodes.\n*   Distant Metastasis ($M$): $M0$ signifies no evidence of distant metastasis.\n\nWe consult the AJCC $8^\\text{th}$ edition staging table for Stage $III$ subgroups:\n- Stage $IIIA$ and $IIIB$ are for lower $T$ and $N$ category burdens.\n- Stage $IIIC$ is defined by several combinations, including any $T$ category plus $N3a$, $N3b$, or $N3c$, provided the criteria for Stage $IIID$ are not met.\n- Stage $IIID$ is the prognostically worst Stage $III$ subgroup and is specifically defined for the combination of $T4b$ with high-burden nodal disease ($N3a$, $N3b$, or $N3c$).\n\nThe patient's classification is $T4bN3cM0$. Since the patient has a $T4b$ primary tumor and $N3c$ regional disease, this combination meets the explicit criteria for **Stage $IIID$**.
