This can be expressed as a ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{F(t)}{F_{0}} = \\frac{E(t)}{E_{0}} \\implies F(t) = F_{0} \\frac{E(t)}{E_{0}}\n$$\nNext, we use the Gibson–Ashby relation, $\\frac{E(t)}{E_{0}} \\approx (1-\\phi(t))^{2}$.

According to mixed-potential theory, both metals will polarize to a common steady-state potential, known as the corrosion potential or mixed potential, $E_{\\text{corr}}$. At this potential, the total rate of oxidation (anodic current) must equal the total rate of reduction (cathodic current) to maintain charge neutrality.\n\nFirst, we identify the anode and cathode. The metal with the more negative equilibrium potential will serve as the anode, and the one with the less negative (more positive) potential will act as the cathode.\nGiven:\n$E_{\\mathrm{eq,CoCr}} = -0.20\\,\\text{V}$\n$E_{\\mathrm{eq,Ti}} = -0.05\\,\\text{V}$\nSince $E_{\\mathrm{eq,CoCr}}  E_{\\mathrm{eq,Ti}}$, the CoCrMo alloy is the anode and the Ti-6Al-4V alloy is the cathode.\n\nThe problem states that the interfacial kinetics are described by a linear relationship in the small-overpotential regime, governed by the polarization resistance, $R_p$. The relationship between the potential $E$, the equilibrium potential $E_{\\text{eq}}$, and the current density $i$ for each metal is given by:\n$$E - E_{\\text{eq}} = i \\cdot R_{p}$$\nThis can be rearranged to express the current density as a function of potential:\n$$i = \\frac{E - E_{\\text{eq}}}{R_{p}}$$\n\nFor the anodic reaction on the CoCrMo alloy, the current density $i_{\\text{CoCr}}$ is:\n$$i_{\\text{CoCr}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{corr}} - E_{\\text{eq,CoCr}}}{R_{p}}$$\nFor the cathodic reaction on the Ti alloy, the current density $i_{\\text{Ti}}$ is:\n$$i_{\\text{Ti}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{corr}} - E_{\\text{eq,Ti}}}{R_{p}}$$\nNote that $R_p$ is given as $200\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}$ for both materials.\n\nThe condition for charge conservation at steady state is that the total anodic current equals the total cathodic current. The total current $I$ from an electrode is the product of its current density $i$ and its area $A$.\n$$I_{\\text{anode}} + I_{\\text{cathode}} = 0$$\n$$I_{\\text{CoCr}} + I_{\\text{Ti}} = 0$$\nSubstituting $I = i \\cdot A$:\n$$i_{\\text{CoCr}} \\cdot A_{\\text{CoCr}} + i_{\\text{Ti}} \\cdot A_{\\text{Ti}} = 0$$\nThe problem states that the exposed areas are equal, $A_{\\text{CoCr}} = A_{\\text{Ti}}$. Therefore, the area term can be factored out and cancelled, simplifying the charge conservation equation to:\n$$i_{\\text{CoCr}} + i_{\\text{Ti}} = 0$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for the current densities into this equation to solve for the corrosion potential, $E_{\\text{corr}}$:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\text{corr}} - E_{\\text{eq,CoCr}}}{R_{p}} + \\frac{E_{\\text{corr}} - E_{\\text{eq,Ti}}}{R_{p}} = 0$$\nSince $R_p$ is a non-zero constant, we can multiply both sides by $R_p$:\n$$(E_{\\text{corr}} - E_{\\text{eq,CoCr}}) + (E_{\\text{corr}} - E_{\\text{eq,Ti}}) = 0$$\n$$2 E_{\\text{corr}} - E_{\\text{eq,CoCr}} - E_{\\text{eq,Ti}} = 0$$\n$$2 E_{\\text{corr}} = E_{\\text{eq,CoCr}} + E_{\\text{eq,Ti}}$$\n$$E_{\\text{corr}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{eq,CoCr}} + E_{\\text{eq,Ti}}}{2}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$E_{\\text{corr}} = \\frac{(-0.20\\,\\text{V}) + (-0.05\\,\\text{V})}{2} = \\frac{-0.25\\,\\text{V}}{2} = -0.125\\,\\text{V}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of the steady-state galvanic current density, $i_g$. This is the magnitude of the current density flowing from the anode or to the cathode at the corrosion potential. We can calculate it using the equation for either metal. For the anode (CoCrMo):\n$$i_g = |i_{\\text{CoCr}}| = \\left| \\frac{E_{\\text{corr}} - E_{\\text{eq,CoCr}}}{R_{p}} \\right|$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$i_g = \\left| \\frac{-0.125\\,\\text{V} - (-0.20\\,\\text{V})}{200\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}} \\right|$$\n$$i_g = \\left| \\frac{0.075\\,\\text{V}}{200\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}} \\right|$$\n$$i_g = \\frac{0.075}{200}\\,\\text{A}\\cdot\\text{cm}^{-2} = 0.000375\\,\\text{A}\\cdot\\text{cm}^{-2}$$\n\nTo verify, we can also calculate it for the cathode (Ti):\n$$i_g = |i_{\\text{Ti}}| = \\left| \\frac{E_{\\text{corr}} - E_{\\text{eq,Ti}}}{R_{p}} \\right|$$\n$$i_g = \\left| \\frac{-0.125\\,\\text{V} - (-0.05\\,\\text{V})}{200\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}} \\right|$$\n$$i_g = \\left| \\frac{-0.075\\,\\text{V}}{200\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}} \\right|$$\n$$i_g = \\frac{0.075}{200}\\,\\text{A}\\cdot\\text{cm}^{-2} = 0.000375\\,\\text{A}\\cdot\\text{cm}^{-2}$$\nThe magnitudes are identical, as expected.\n\nThe question requires the result expressed in $\\text{A}\\cdot\\text{cm}^{-2}$ and rounded to three significant figures.
