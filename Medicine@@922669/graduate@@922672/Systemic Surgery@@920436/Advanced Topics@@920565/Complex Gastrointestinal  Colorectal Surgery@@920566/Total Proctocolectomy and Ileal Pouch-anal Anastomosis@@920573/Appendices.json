Because Crohn’s disease is a strong contraindication to ileal pouch construction due to high risk of pouch failure, the preoperative workup includes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the pelvis to detect perianal fistulas. Consider MRI detection of perianal fistulas as a diagnostic test for Crohn’s disease, where the sensitivity is $0.85$ and the specificity is $0.90$ in the surgical candidate population. In this population, the pretest probability (prevalence) of Crohn’s disease among patients considered for IPAA is $0.20$.

The application to medical diagnostics is a standard and well-established use of these principles. The clinical context is realistic and medically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated and provides all necessary numerical values (sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence) to calculate the desired quantity ($P(D\\mid T^{+})$). The solution is unique and stable.\n- **Objective**: The problem is formulated using precise, quantitative language and is free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The provided probabilities are consistent (i.e., they are all within the range $[0, 1]$). The information required to find any complementary probabilities, such as $P(\\neg D)$ and $P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D)$, can be directly derived from the givens. There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. Therefore, I will proceed with a formal solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to compute the post-test probability of a patient having Crohn’s disease given a positive MRI result, which is the conditional probability $P(D\\mid T^{+})$. The fundamental tool for this calculation is Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$ P(D\\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+}\\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^{+})} $$\nThe components of this formula are:\n- $P(T^{+}\\mid D)$: The probability of a positive test given the disease is present. This is the sensitivity, given as $0.85$.\n- $P(D)$: The prior probability of having the disease. This is the prevalence, given as $0.20$.\n- $P(T^{+})$: The overall probability of a positive test in this population. This term is not directly given and must be calculated.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^{+})$, can be found using the law of total probability. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive scenarios: a true positive (the patient has the disease and tests positive) or a false positive (the patient does not have the disease but tests positive). The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:\n$$ P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\cap D) + P(T^{+} \\cap \\neg D) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A \\mid B) P(B)$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$ P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+}\\mid D)P(D) + P(T^{+}\\mid \\neg D)P(\\neg D) $$\nWe are given $P(T^{+}\\mid D) = 0.85$ and $P(D) = 0.20$. We must derive the remaining two terms, $P(\\neg D)$ and $P(T^{+}\\mid \\neg D)$.\n\n$1$. The probability of not having the disease, $P(\\neg D)$, is the complement of the prevalence:\n$$ P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80 $$\n\n$2$. The probability of a positive test given no disease, $P(T^{+}\\mid \\neg D)$, is the false positive rate. It is the complement of the specificity, $P(T^{-}\\mid \\neg D)$.\n$$ P(T^{+}\\mid \\neg D) = 1 - P(T^{-}\\mid \\neg D) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 $$\n\nNow, we can compute the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^{+})$:\n$$ P(T^{+}) = (0.85)(0.20) + (0.10)(0.80) $$\n$$ P(T^{+}) = 0.170 + 0.080 = 0.250 $$\n\nWith all components known, we can substitute them back into Bayes' theorem to find the post-test probability $P(D\\mid T^{+})$:\n$$ P(D\\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+}\\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^{+})} = \\frac{(0.85)(0.20)}{0.25} $$\n$$ P(D\\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{0.17}{0.25} $$\nTo compute the final value:\n$$ P(D\\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{17}{25} = \\frac{68}{100} = 0.68 $$\nThus, for a patient in this population with a positive MRI finding, the probability of having Crohn’s disease is $0.68$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.68}$$", "id": "5196519"}, {"introduction": "Evidence-based surgery requires the ability to translate clinical trial results into actionable strategies.

The fundamental principle governing this calculation is the conservation of mass. For a substance to be in neutral balance, the rate of intake (replacement) must precisely equal the rate of output (loss) over a given time period. The problem explicitly states that we are to consider only the losses from the ileostomy, with other routes of loss being negligible.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the information provided:\n- The daily volume of ileostomy effluent: $V_{effluent} = 2.5 \\ \\mathrm{L/day}$.\n- The sodium concentration in the ileostomy effluent: $[Na^+]_{effluent} = 90 \\ \\mathrm{mmol/L}$.\n\nFirst, we address the requirement for neutral fluid balance.
