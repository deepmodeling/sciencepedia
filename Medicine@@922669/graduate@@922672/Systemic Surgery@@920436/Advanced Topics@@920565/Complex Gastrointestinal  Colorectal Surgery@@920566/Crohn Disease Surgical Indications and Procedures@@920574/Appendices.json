He is scheduled for elective ileocecal resection due to a symptomatic stricturing phenotype with intermittent partial small bowel obstruction localized to the terminal ileum on Computed Tomography (CT). He is otherwise hemodynamically stable, afebrile, without intra-abdominal sepsis, and has no enterocutaneous fistula. His measured body mass is $60$ kilograms, with hypoalbuminemia consistent with moderate protein-energy malnutrition. The estimated small bowel length is approximately $300$ centimeters with only a short segment strictured at the ileocecal region; liquids pass through the narrowed segment without provoking obstructive symptoms.

All necessary data and conditions for both the calculation and the logical deduction are provided.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part response: first, the calculation of daily energy and protein requirements, and second, a principled justification for the choice between Enteral Nutrition (EN) and Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) for preoperative optimization.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of Energy and Protein Requirements\n\nThe problem states that for malnourished patients with Crohn's disease (CD) undergoing surgery, the daily energy and protein targets scale in proportion to body mass. The prescriptive scaling factors are given.\n\nLet $m$ be the body mass of the patient in kilograms ($\\text{kg}$). The patient's mass is given as $m = 60\\ \\text{kg}$.\n\nThe daily energy requirement, $E$, is prescribed at a rate of $30\\ \\text{kcal/kg/day}$. We can express this as a function of mass, $E(m)$, where the constant of proportionality is $k_E = 30\\ \\text{kcal}\\cdot\\text{kg}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{day}^{-1}$.\n$$E(m) = k_E \\cdot m$$\nFor the given patient with $m = 60\\ \\text{kg}$:\n$$E = (30\\ \\text{kcal}\\cdot\\text{kg}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{day}^{-1}) \\cdot (60\\ \\text{kg})$$\n$$E = 1800\\ \\text{kcal/day}$$\n\nThe daily protein requirement, $P$, is prescribed at a rate of $1.5\\ \\text{g/kg/day}$. We can express this as a function of mass, $P(m)$, where the constant of proportionality is $k_P = 1.5\\ \\text{g}\\cdot\\text{kg}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{day}^{-1}$.\n$$P(m) = k_P \\cdot m$$\nFor the given patient with $m = 60\\ \\text{kg}$:\n$$P = (1.5\\ \\text{g}\\cdot\\text{kg}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{day}^{-1}) \\cdot (60\\ \\text{kg})$$\n$$P = 90\\ \\text{g/day}$$\n\nThus, the calculated daily nutritional targets for this patient are $1800\\ \\text{kcal}$ for energy and $90\\ \\text{g}$ for protein.\n\nPart 2: Justification for Choice of Nutrition Route (EN vs. TPN)\n\nThe selection between Enteral Nutrition (EN) and Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is governed by fundamental principles of gastrointestinal physiology and evidence-based clinical practice. The foremost principle is: \"If the gastrointestinal tract is functional, it must be used.\" The decision process involves evaluating the patient's gut function and then weighing the distinct benefits of EN against the significant risks of TPN.\n\n1.  Assessment of Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract Function:\n    The problem statement specifies that the patient has a symptomatic stricture at the terminal ileum, causing intermittent partial small bowel obstruction. Critically, it is also stated that \"liquids pass through the narrowed segment without provoking obstructive symptoms.\" This indicates that the GI tract is not completely obstructed and remains at least partially functional. The entire GI tract proximal to the short strictured segment—namely the stomach, duodenum, and the vast majority of the jejunum (total small bowel length is approximately $300\\ \\text{cm}$)—is anatomically intact and physiologically available for the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Therefore, the gut is accessible and functional.\n\n2.  Physiological and Clinical Benefits of Enteral Nutrition (EN):\n    EN involves the delivery of a nutritionally complete formula directly into the stomach, duodenum, or jejunum. Its use is predicated on leveraging the natural physiological processes of the gut.\n    *   Maintenance of Gut Mucosal Integrity: The presence of nutrients within the gut lumen (luminal nutrition) is the primary stimulus for maintaining the health of the intestinal mucosa. These nutrients are trophic to enterocytes, preserving the structural and functional integrity of the gut barrier. This prevents mucosal atrophy, which is a known consequence of gut disuse.\n    *   Prevention of Bacterial Translocation: A healthy gut barrier is crucial for preventing the translocation of bacteria and their byproducts (e.g., endotoxins) from the intestinal lumen into the portal circulation and systemic bloodstream. Bacterial translocation can trigger a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and lead to sepsis, which is a major driver of postoperative morbidity.\n    *   Support of Immune Function: The gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) represents a substantial portion of the body's immune system. EN stimulates GALT, helping to maintain a balanced immune response. Gut disuse, as occurs with TPN, is associated with GALT atrophy and immune dysfunction.\n    *   Safety and Cost: EN is generally safer, associated with fewer and less severe complications (e.g., diarrhea, gastric intolerance) compared to TPN. It is also substantially less expensive.\n\n3.  Risks and Complications of Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN):\n    TPN involves the intravenous infusion of all required nutrients, completely bypassing the gastrointestinal tract. While life-saving in cases of a non-functional gut (e.g., complete bowel obstruction, prolonged ileus, high-output fistula), its use is associated with significant and severe risks.\n    *   Infectious Complications: TPN requires a central venous catheter, which creates a direct portal of entry for microorganisms into the bloodstream. Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) are a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and increased healthcare costs. In this hemodynamically stable, afebrile patient, electively placing a central line for TPN would introduce an unnecessary iatrogenic risk.\n    *   Metabolic Complications: The high glucose load and artificial nature of TPN can lead to numerous metabolic disturbances, including hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and refeeding syndrome in a malnourished patient.\n    *   Hepatobiliary Dysfunction: Long-term TPN can cause hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) and cholestasis, which can progress to liver failure.\n    *   Gut Atrophy: As the inverse of EN's benefits, the complete bypass of the gut with TPN leads to mucosal atrophy, increased intestinal permeability, bacterial translocation, and immune compromise—precisely the outcomes one seeks to avoid in a patient preparing for major surgery.\n\n4.  Synthesis and Conclusion:\n    For this specific patient, the GI tract is functional and accessible. The partial nature of the obstruction, allowing passage of liquids, is a clear indication for an attempt at EN. A liquid enteral formula can be infused, likely starting at a low rate and advancing as tolerated, to meet the calculated energy and protein goals. If gastric intolerance were an issue, a nasojejunal tube could be placed to bypass the stomach and deliver the feed directly into the jejunum.\n\n    Choosing EN aligns with the goals of preoperative optimization within an ERAS pathway. It actively prepares the gut for the physiological stress of surgery by maintaining its barrier function and immunological competence, thereby reducing the risk of postoperative septic complications. Conversely, choosing TPN would fail to provide these benefits, induce gut atrophy, and expose the patient to the significant risks of CRBSI and metabolic derangements without a valid clinical indication.\n\n    Therefore, based on a rigorous application of first principles, Enteral Nutrition (EN) is the unequivocally superior and indicated choice for this patient's preoperative nutritional support.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 1800 & 90 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5106412"}, {"introduction": "The art of surgery for Crohn's disease lies in tailoring the operative plan to the unique anatomy of a patient's disease while adhering to the principle of maximal bowel preservation.

The described findings (strictures, abscess, fistula), surgical principles (bowel preservation, indications for resection vs. strictureplasty), and surgical techniques (Heineke-Mikulicz, Finney, Michelassi, resection) are fundamental concepts in gastrointestinal surgery and are factually correct.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

A unique, rational solution can be derived.\n- **Objective**: The problem uses precise, objective clinical terminology. The lengths of strictures and their characteristics (fibrotic, penetrating) are given as definite findings, not subjective impressions.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It provides all necessary information to derive a logical solution based on the established principles of surgery for Crohn's disease. The problem is valid. The analysis may proceed.\n\nDerivation of the Optimal Operative Plan:\nThe task is to apply the given principles to each of the three strictured segments to construct a comprehensive surgical plan.\n\n1.  **Proximal Jejunal Segment**:\n    - Length: $6\\ \\text{cm}$.\n    - Characteristics: Fibrotic, nonpenetrating.\n    - Application of Principles: The principle \"Strictureplasty is appropriate for nonpenetrating fibrotic strictures\" applies directly. The principle \"surgery should... preserv[e] bowel length\" favors strictureplasty over resection. The length of $6\\ \\text{cm}$ falls within the common range for a Heineke–Mikulicz strictureplasty ($<10\\ \\text{cm}$).\n    - Conclusion for this segment: Heineke–Mikulicz strictureplasty.\n\n2.  **Mid-Ileal Segment**:\n    - Length: $14\\ \\text{cm}$.\n    - Characteristics: Fibrotic, nonpenetrating.\n    - Application of Principles: As with the jejunal segment, this is a nonpenetrating fibrotic stricture, making strictureplasty the preferred, bowel-preserving option. The length of $14\\ \\text{cm}$ fits the guideline for a Finney strictureplasty (commonly about $10$ to $20\\ \\text{cm}$).\n    - Conclusion for this segment: Finney strictureplasty.\n\n3.  **Distal Ileal Segment**:\n    - Length: $25\\ \\text{cm}$.\n    - Characteristics: Contained mesenteric abscess and a fistulous tract. These are definitive features of penetrating Crohn's disease.\n    - Application of Principles: Two principles are critically important here. First, \"Strictureplasty is... contraindicated in the setting of abscess...\". This explicitly forbids any form of strictureplasty for this segment. Second, \"resection should be limited to segments with penetrating complications.\" This provides the correct action.\n    - Conclusion for this segment: Limited segmental resection of the $25\\ \\text{cm}$ diseased segment.\n\n**Synthesized Operative Plan**:\nThe optimal plan, derived by rigorously applying the provided principles to each segment, is:\n- Heineke–Mikulicz strictureplasty for the $6\\ \\text{cm}$ proximal jejunal stricture.\n- Finney strictureplasty for the $14\\ \\text{cm}$ mid-ileal stricture.\n- Limited resection for the $25\\ \\text{cm}$ distal ileal stricture with its associated abscess and fistula.\n\nThis plan successfully relieves obstruction at all three sites while maximizing bowel preservation (only $25\\ \\text{cm}$ is resected, whereas the other $20\\ \\text{cm}$ of strictured bowel is preserved) and adhering to the absolute contraindication of performing strictureplasty on a segment with penetrating/septic complications.\n\nEvaluation of Options:\n\nA. Segmental resection of all three strictures ($6\\ \\text{cm}$, $14\\ \\text{cm}$, and $25\\ \\text{cm}$), totaling $45\\ \\text{cm}$, with primary anastomoses.\nThis plan is surgically feasible and would treat the penetrating disease correctly. However, it violates the principle of maximal bowel preservation. The proximal two strictures, totaling $6\\ \\text{cm} + 14\\ \\text{cm} = 20\\ \\text{cm}$, are fibrotic and non-penetrating, making them ideal candidates for bowel-sparing strictureplasty. Unnecessary resection of this bowel length is contrary to the stated goals.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nB. Limited resection of the distal ileal segment ($25\\ \\text{cm}$) due to penetrating disease, Heineke–Mikulicz strictureplasty for the proximal jejunal segment ($6\\ \\text{cm}$), and Finney strictureplasty for the mid-ileal segment ($14\\ \\text{cm}$).\nThis option perfectly matches the derived optimal plan. It correctly identifies that the distal segment with abscess/fistula must be resected. It correctly proposes strictureplasty for the two non-penetrating segments to preserve bowel length. Furthermore, it selects the appropriate type of strictureplasty for each segment based on the length guidelines provided (Heineke-Mikulicz for the $6\\ \\text{cm}$ segment, Finney for the $14\\ \\text{cm}$ segment). This plan adheres to all stated principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nC. Strictureplasty for all segments: Heineke–Mikulicz for the proximal ($6\\ \\text{cm}$), Finney for the mid-ileal ($14\\ \\text{cm}$), and side-to-side isoperistaltic (Michelassi) strictureplasty for the distal ileal segment ($25\\ \\text{cm}$) despite the contained abscess and fistula.\nThis plan fundamentally violates a critical safety principle. The problem explicitly states that strictureplasty is contraindicated in the presence of an abscess. Performing a strictureplasty on the distal ileal segment would incorporate the septic focus into the repair, risking anastomotic breakdown, persistent sepsis, and surgical failure. This is a dangerous and incorrect approach.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. Endoscopic Balloon Dilation (EBD) of all three strictures, deferring surgery.\nEBD is not appropriate for this patient. The strictures are long (especially the $14\\ \\text{cm}$ and $25\\ \\text{cm}$ segments), and there are multiple sites of disease. Most critically, attempting EBD on the distal ileal segment, which has an associated abscess and fistula, is absolutely contraindicated and carries a high risk of perforation and uncontrolled sepsis. The patient's recurrent obstructive symptoms with MRE evidence of prestenotic dilation indicate significant disease burden that warrants a definitive surgical solution.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nE. Bypass of the distal ileal segment with a side-to-side enteroenterostomy, combined with Heineke–Mikulicz and Finney strictureplasties for the proximal and mid segments respectively.\nWhile the management of the proximal two segments is correct, the bypass of the distal segment is a suboptimal and largely historical approach. Modern surgical practice for Crohn's disease advocates for resection of segments with penetrating complications. Leaving a diseased, abscess-containing segment in situ (even if bypassed) creates a blind loop that remains a source of chronic inflammation, sepsis, and a potential risk for malignant transformation. Resection is the safer, definitive treatment for the distal segment.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5106366"}, {"introduction": "A surgeon's responsibility extends beyond the operating room to the long-term management of Crohn's disease, where preventing recurrence is paramount.
