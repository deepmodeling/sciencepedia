In FAP, duodenal adenomatous polyposis severity is commonly stratified by the Spigelman classification, which assigns points to four variables: number of adenomas, size of the largest adenoma, histologic subtype, and dysplasia grade. These variables are scored using widely accepted, categorical rules and summed to a total score, which is then mapped to a stage that guides surveillance and surgical decision-making in systemic surgery practice.\n\nDefine the following variables and scoring functions to formalize the Spigelman system:\n- Let $N$ be the total count of duodenal adenomas observed. Define the number score $f_{N}(N)$ by the categorical rules: $f_{N}(N)=0$ if $N=0$, $f_{N}(N)=1$ if $1 \\leq N \\leq 4$, $f_{N}(N)=2$ if $5 \\leq N \\leq 20$, and $f_{N}(N)=3$ if $N > 20$.\n- Let $D_{\\max}$ be the diameter of the largest duodenal adenoma in millimeters. Define the size score $f_{S}(D_{\\max})$ by: $f_{S}(D_{\\max})=0$ if $D_{\\max}=0$, $f_{S}(D_{\\max})=1$ if $1 \\leq D_{\\max} \\leq 4$, $f_{S}(D_{\\max})=2$ if $5 \\leq D_{\\max} \\leq 10$, and $f_{S}(D_{\\max})=3$ if $D_{\\max} > 10$.\n- Let $H_{\\max}$ denote the most advanced histologic architecture among all adenomas, categorized as tubular, tubulovillous, or villous. Define the histology score $f_{H}(H_{\\max})$ by: $f_{H}(H_{\\max})=0$ if no adenomas are present, $f_{H}(H_{\\max})=1$ if $H_{\\max}$ is tubular, $f_{H}(H_{\\max})=2$ if $H_{\\max}$ is tubulovillous, and $f_{H}(H_{\\max})=3$ if $H_{\\max}$ is villous.\n- Let $G_{\\max}$ denote the highest grade of dysplasia identified among all adenomas, categorized as low-grade, moderate-grade, or high-grade. Define the dysplasia score $f_{D}(G_{\\max})$ by: $f_{D}(G_{\\max})=0$ if no adenomas are present, $f_{D}(G_{\\max})=1$ if $G_{\\max}$ is low-grade, $f_{D}(G_{\\max})=2$ if $G_{\\max}$ is moderate-grade, and $f_{D}(G_{\\max})=3$ if $G_{\\max}$ is high-grade.\n\nLet the total Spigelman score be $$S=f_{N}(N)+f_{S}(D_{\\max})+f_{H}(H_{\\max})+f_{D}(G_{\\max}).$$ The stage mapping is defined as follows: Stage $0$ if $S=0$; Stage $1$ if $1 \\leq S \\leq 4$; Stage $2$ if $5 \\leq S \\leq 6$; Stage $3$ if $7 \\leq S \\leq 8$; and Stage $4$ if $9 \\leq S \\leq 12$.\n\nA side-viewing duodenoscopy reveals the following duodenal polyp profile in this patient:\n- There are $14$ adenomas distributed in the second portion of the duodenum.\n- Measured diameters are: $4$ adenomas of $3$ mm, $7$ adenomas between $6$ and $8$ mm, $2$ adenomas of $11$ mm, and $1$ adenoma of $18$ mm. Thus, the largest adenoma has $D_{\\max}=18$ mm.\n- Histology shows the $18$ mm adenoma to be villous; the $11$ mm adenomas are tubulovillous; the remaining adenomas are tubular.\n- Dysplasia grading shows high-grade dysplasia in the $18$ mm villous adenoma; all other adenomas have low-grade dysplasia.\n\nUsing the definitions above, compute the Spigelman stage for this profile.

All necessary data and definitions are provided, allowing for a unique and verifiable solution. We proceed with the calculation.\n\nThe objective is to determine the Spigelman stage for a patient with FAP based on their duodenal polyp profile. The total Spigelman score, denoted by $S$, is the sum of $4$ component scores: the number score ($f_{N}$), the size score ($f_{S}$), the histology score ($f_{H}$), and the dysplasia score ($f_{D}$). We will calculate each component score individually and then sum them to find $S$. Finally, we will map $S$ to the corresponding Spigelman stage.\n\nThe patient's profile provides the following data:\n- Total number of adenomas: $N = 14$.\n- Diameter of the largest adenoma: $D_{\\max} = 18$ mm.\n- Most advanced histologic architecture: $H_{\\max}$ is villous.\n- Highest grade of dysplasia: $G_{\\max}$ is high-grade.\n\nThe calculation of the component scores proceeds as follows:\n- The number score, $f_{N}(N)$, is determined by the total count of adenomas, $N=14$. According to the defined rule for the interval $5 \\leq N \\leq 20$, which contains $14$, the score is $f_{N}(14) = 2$.\n- The size score, $f_{S}(D_{\\max})$, depends on the maximum adenoma diameter, $D_{\\max}=18$ mm. This value satisfies the condition $D_{\\max} > 10$, yielding a score of $f_{S}(18) = 3$.\n- The histology score, $f_{H}(H_{\\max})$, is based on the most advanced histology. The finding of a villous adenoma ($H_{\\max}=\\text{villous}$) corresponds to a score of $f_{H}(\\text{villous})=3$.\n- The dysplasia score, $f_{D}(G_{\\max})$, is determined by the highest grade of dysplasia. The presence of high-grade dysplasia ($G_{\\max}=\\text{high-grade}$) results in a score of $f_{D}(\\text{high-grade})=3$.\n\nNow, we compute the total Spigelman score, $S$, by summing the individual scores:\n$$S = f_{N}(N) + f_{S}(D_{\\max}) + f_{H}(H_{\\max}) + f_{D}(G_{\\max})$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$S = 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 11$$\n\nFinally, we determine the Spigelman stage using the provided mapping from the total score $S$ to the stage. The staging rules are:\n- Stage $0$: $S=0$\n- Stage $1$: $1 \\leq S \\leq 4$\n- Stage $2$: $5 \\leq S \\leq 6$\n- Stage $3$: $7 \\leq S \\leq 8$\n- Stage $4$: $9 \\leq S \\leq 12$\n\nOur calculated total score is $S=11$. This value falls within the range for Stage $4$, as $9 \\leq 11 \\leq 12$. Therefore, the Spigelman stage for this patient's profile is determined to be $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "5100813"}, {"introduction": "Identifying which patients warrant germline genetic testing for Lynch syndrome is a common and critical decision in surgical practice.
