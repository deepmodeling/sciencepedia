We may proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of three quantities related to a colorectal cancer screening program: the Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$), the Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$), and the expected colonoscopy volume. These will be derived in terms of the test's sensitivity ($Se$), specificity ($Sp$), and the disease prevalence ($p$).\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a screened individual has the disease, and let $D^c$ be the complement event, that the individual does not have the disease.

Derivation of the Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$)**\n\nThe $PPV$ is defined as the probability that an individual with a positive test result actually has the disease, i.e., $PPV = \\mathbb{P}(D \\mid T^{+})$. We use Bayes' theorem to express this quantity:\n\n$$ PPV = \\mathbb{P}(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(T^{+} \\mid D) \\mathbb{P}(D)}{\\mathbb{P}(T^{+})} $$\n\nThe numerator contains the given quantities: $\\mathbb{P}(T^{+} \\mid D) = Se$ and $\\mathbb{P}(D) = p$.\nThe denominator, $\\mathbb{P}(T^{+})$, is the overall probability of a positive test.

Derivation of the Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$)**\n\nThe $NPV$ is defined as the probability that an individual with a negative test result is truly disease-free, i.e., $NPV = \\mathbb{P}(D^{c} \\mid T^{-})$. Again, we use Bayes' theorem:\n\n$$ NPV = \\mathbb{P}(D^{c} \\mid T^{-}) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(T^{-} \\mid D^{c}) \\mathbb{P}(D^{c})}{\\mathbb{P}(T^{-})} $$\n\nThe numerator terms are: $\\mathbb{P(T^{-} | D^c)} = Sp$ and $\\mathbb{P}(D^{c}) = 1 - p$.\nThe denominator, $\\mathbb{P}(T^{-})$, is the overall probability of a negative test. Using the Law of Total Probability:\n\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T^{-}) = \\mathbb{P}(T^{-} \\mid D)\\mathbb{P}(D) + \\mathbb{P}(T^{-} \\mid D^{c})\\mathbb{P}(D^{c}) $$\n\nSubstituting the known terms:\n- $\\mathbb{P}(T^{-} \\mid D) = 1 - Se$\n- $\\mathbb{P}(D) = p$\n- $\\mathbb{P}(T^{-} \\mid D^{c}) = Sp$\n- $\\mathbb{P}(D^{c}) = 1 - p$\n\nThe expression for $\\mathbb{P}(T^{-})$ becomes:\n\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T^{-}) = (1 - Se)(p) + (Sp)(1 - p) $$\n\nSubstituting this back into the Bayes' theorem formula for $NPV$:\n\n$$ NPV = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1 - p)}{(1 - Se) \\cdot p + Sp \\cdot (1 - p)} $$\n\nThis is the analytic expression for the $NPV$.\n\n**3. Derivation of the Expected Colonoscopy Volume**\n\nThe problem states that all individuals with a positive Fecal Immunochemical Test ($T^{+}$) are referred for a diagnostic colonoscopy. For a population of size $N$, the number of individuals expected to test positive is the total population size multiplied by the probability of a single individual testing positive, $\\mathbb{P}(T^{+})$.\n\nLet $V_c$ denote the expected colonoscopy volume. Then:\n\n$$ V_c = N \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(T^{+}) $$\n\nWe have already derived the expression for $\\mathbb{P}(T^{+})$ in the $PPV$ derivation.

The language is objective and precise. The inclusion of specificity ($Sp$) is noted, but it is extraneous to the calculation of ARR as defined by the problem, which focuses solely on the risk reduction from detecting and treating AAs. Since the problem is valid, we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe Number Needed to Screen (NNS) is defined as the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR):\n$$\nNNS = \\frac{1}{ARR}\n$$\nThe ARR is the difference between the risk of developing CRC in an unscreened individual ($R_{unscreened}$) and the risk in a screened individual ($R_{screened}$) over the specified ten-year horizon. The problem explicitly states that only the risk attributable to the AA pathway contributes to the ARR.\n$$\nARR = R_{unscreened} - R_{screened}\n$$\nWe will now derive expressions for $R_{unscreened}$ and $R_{screened}$.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the risk for an individual in an unscreened population, $R_{unscreened}$. An unscreened individual develops CRC from the AA pathway only if they have a prevalent AA and it progresses to CRC. The probability of this sequence of events is the product of the prevalence of AA, $p_{AA}$, and the conditional probability of progression, $r_{AA}$.\n$$\nR_{unscreened} = p_{AA} \\times r_{AA}\n$$\nNext, let's calculate the risk for an individual in the screened population, $R_{screened}$. We consider a person with a prevalent AA, which occurs with probability $p_{AA}$. This person undergoes colonoscopy. Two mutually exclusive outcomes are possible regarding the AA:\n1.  The AA is detected (a true positive event). This occurs with a probability equal to the sensitivity, $Se$. The detected AA is then removed via polypectomy, which has an efficacy $E$. The efficacy is a proportional risk reduction, so the residual risk of progression to CRC from this removed lesion is $r_{AA} \\times (1 - E)$. The total probability of an individual having an AA, it being detected, and it still progressing to CRC is $p_{AA} \\times Se \\times r_{AA} \\times (1 - E)$.\n2.  The AA is missed by the colonoscopy (a false negative event). This occurs with a probability of $1 - Se$. Since the AA is not detected or removed, it carries the full risk of progression, $r_{AA}$. The total probability of an individual having an AA, it being missed, and it then progressing to CRC is $p_{AA} \\times (1 - Se) \\times r_{AA}$.\n\nThe total risk for a screened individual, $R_{screened}$, is the sum of the probabilities of these two pathways leading to CRC.\n$$\nR_{screened} = \\left( p_{AA} \\times Se \\times r_{AA} \\times (1 - E) \\right) + \\left( p_{AA} \\times (1 - Se) \\times r_{AA} \\right)\n$$\nWe can factor out the common terms $p_{AA}$ and $r_{AA}$:\n$$\nR_{screened} = p_{AA} \\times r_{AA} \\times [Se \\times (1 - E) + (1 - Se)]\n$$\nSimplifying the expression within the brackets:\n$$\nR_{screened} = p_{AA} \\times r_{AA} \\times [Se - Se \\cdot E + 1 - Se]\n$$\n$$\nR_{screened} = p_{AA} \\times r_{AA} \\times (1 - Se \\cdot E)\n$$\nNow we can compute the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR):\n$$\nARR = R_{unscreened} - R_{screened}\n$$\n$$\nARR = (p_{AA} \\times r_{AA}) - (p_{AA} \\times r_{AA} \\times (1 - Se \\cdot E))\n$$\nFactoring out the term $p_{AA} \\times r_{AA}$:\n$$\nARR = p_{AA} \\times r_{AA} \\times [1 - (1 - Se \\cdot E)]\n$$\n$$\nARR = p_{AA} \\times r_{AA} \\times [1 - 1 + Se \\cdot E]\n$$\n$$\nARR = p_{AA} \\times r_{AA} \\times Se \\times E\n$$\nThis result is intuitive: the total risk reduction is the product of the probabilities of each necessary step in the causal chain: having the precursor ($p_{AA}$), it being destined to progress ($r_{AA}$), detecting it ($Se$), and successfully preventing its progression via treatment ($E$).\n\nNow we can write the expression for NNS:\n$$\nNNS = \\frac{1}{ARR} = \\frac{1}{p_{AA} \\times r_{AA} \\times Se \\times E}\n$$\nWe substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n-   $p_{AA} = 0.06$\n-   $r_{AA} = 0.08$\n-   $Se = 0.95$\n-   $E = 0.90$\n\n$$\nNNS = \\frac{1}{0.06 \\times 0.08 \\times 0.95 \\times 0.90}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the denominator (the ARR):\n$$\nARR = 0.06 \\times 0.08 \\times 0.95 \\times 0.90\n$$\n$$\nARR = 0.0048 \\times 0.855\n$$\n$$\nARR = 0.004104\n$$\nNow, we compute the NNS:\n$$\nNNS = \\frac{1}{0.004104} \\approx 243.664717\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nNNS \\approx 244\n$$\nTherefore, approximately $244$ people need to be screened with colonoscopy to prevent one case of colorectal cancer over a ten-year horizon under this model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{244}$$", "id": "5100206"}, {"introduction": "A one-size-fits-all screening strategy is often suboptimal, as risk varies significantly across the population.
