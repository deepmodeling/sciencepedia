Based on integrated pretest assessment using clinical features and cross-sectional imaging, the pretest probability of malignant gastric outlet obstruction is estimated to be $0.60$. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with mucosal forceps biopsies is performed; the result is nondiagnostic, operationally defined as no malignant cells identified.

You will calculate and compare the volumes of different crystalloid solutions needed to correct a chloride deficit, providing a quantitative basis for understanding why certain fluids are more effective at resolving the characteristic hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis.", "problem": "A $70$ kg patient with gastric outlet obstruction from chronic pyloric stenosis presents with hypovolemia and hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis after several days of nonbilious vomiting. On admission, arterial blood gas shows a pH consistent with metabolic alkalosis and serum electrolytes are $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}] = 140$ mEq/L and $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}] = 78$ mEq/L. Assume the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume is initially $0.20 \\times$ body weight and that the infused fluid distributes only within the ECF with instantaneous mixing, there are no ongoing gastrointestinal or renal losses, and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO$_{2}$) and total concentration of weak acids remain approximately constant over the time frame considered.\n\nYou plan to correct the chloride deficit to restore $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]$ to a target of $102$ mEq/L using crystalloid infusion.

Express your final answer as a dimensionless number and round to three significant figures.", "solution": "The core principle for solving this problem is the conservation of mass, specifically for chloride ions ($\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$), within the patient's extracellular fluid (ECF). We can state this principle with a mass balance equation: the final total amount of chloride in the ECF must equal the initial amount plus the amount added through infusion.\n\nLet us define the variables:\n- $V_{\\text{ECF},0}$ is the initial volume of the ECF.\n- $V_{\\text{inf}}$ is the volume of the infused crystalloid fluid.\n- $V_{\\text{ECF},f}$ is the final volume of the ECF after infusion.\n- $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_0$ is the initial concentration of chloride in the ECF.\n- $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_f$ is the final (target) concentration of chloride in the ECF.\n- $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\text{inf}}$ is the concentration of chloride in the infused fluid.\n\nThe total amount of a substance in a volume is the product of its concentration and the volume. The mass balance equation for chloride is therefore:\n$$[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_f \\times V_{\\text{ECF},f} = [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_0 \\times V_{\\text{ECF},0} + [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\text{inf}} \\times V_{\\text{inf}}$$\nThe problem states that the infused volume is added to the ECF, so the final ECF volume is the sum of the initial and infused volumes:\n$$V_{\\text{ECF},f} = V_{\\text{ECF},0} + V_{\\text{inf}}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $V_{\\text{ECF},f}$ into the mass balance equation gives:\n$$[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_f \\times (V_{\\text{ECF},0} + V_{\\text{inf}}) = [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_0 \\times V_{\\text{ECF},0} + [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\text{inf}} \\times V_{\\text{inf}}$$\nThis equation represents the general relation required to determine the infusion volume. To make it more explicit, we can solve for $V_{\\text{inf}}$:\n$$[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_f V_{\\text{ECF},0} + [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_f V_{\\text{inf}} = [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_0 V_{\\text{ECF},0} + [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\text{inf}} V_{\\text{inf}}$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate $V_{\\text{inf}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{inf}} ([\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\text{inf}} - [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_f) = V_{\\text{ECF},0} ([\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_f - [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_0)$$\n$$V_{\\text{inf}} = V_{\\text{ECF},0} \\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_f - [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_0}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\text{inf}} - [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_f}$$\nThis derived relation allows calculation of the required infusion volume to reach a target chloride concentration.\n\nThe context of this correction is the patient's metabolic alkalosis. According to the Stewart model of acid-base physiology, this alkalosis is caused by an elevated Strong Ion Difference (SID), which is the difference between the concentrations of strong cations and strong anions. For this patient, the key contributors are $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]$ and $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]$. The initial apparent SID is $\\text{SID}_{\\text{app},0} = [\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_0 - [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_0 = 140 \\, \\text{mEq/L} - 78 \\, \\text{mEq/L} = 62 \\, \\text{mEq/L}$. This high SID (normal is approximately $40 \\, \\text{mEq/L}$) drives the metabolic alkalosis. By infusing a chloride-containing solution, we increase $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]$ and thus lower the SID, correcting the acid-base disturbance. The choice of fluid affects the efficiency of this correction.\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio of the volumes required for Lactated Ringer’s ($V_{\\text{LR}}$) versus normal saline ($V_{\\text{NS}}$) to achieve the same target $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_f$.\n\nLet $V_{\\text{NS}}$ be the required volume of normal saline. The chloride concentration in normal saline is $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\text{NS}} = 154 \\, \\text{mEq/L}$. Using our derived formula:\n$$V_{\\text{NS}} = V_{\\text{ECF},0} \\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_f - [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_0}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\text{NS}} - [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_f}$$\nLet $V_{\\text{LR}}$ be the required volume of Lactated Ringer’s. The chloride concentration in Lactated Ringer's is $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\text{LR}} = 109 \\, \\text{mEq/L}$.
