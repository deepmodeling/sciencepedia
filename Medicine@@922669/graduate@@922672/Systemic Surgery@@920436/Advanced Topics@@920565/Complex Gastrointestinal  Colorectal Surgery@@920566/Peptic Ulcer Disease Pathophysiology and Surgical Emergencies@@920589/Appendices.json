The surgical team initiates an intravenous Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) infusion to suppress gastric acid secretion. For clinical decision-making on post-endoscopic rebleeding risk, you are asked to quantify the expected reduction in acid output due to the PPI, using first principles of parietal cell physiology.\n\nUse the following assumptions, grounded in parietal cell physiology and the mechanism of PPI action:\n- Gastric acid secretion is generated by the $H^{+}/K^{+}$-ATPase in parietal cells, and the secretion rate $S$ is directly proportional to the number of active pumps, so $S = \\alpha N_{\\text{active}}$, where $\\alpha$ is a constant secretory capacity per active pump and $N_{\\text{active}}$ is the number of active pumps.\n- Under continuous intravenous PPI at steady state, $90\\%$ of active $H^{+}/K^{+}$-ATPase pumps are inhibited, meaning the fraction of pumps remaining active is $(1 - f)$ with $f = 0.90$.\n- Before PPI administration, the measured stimulated baseline acid output (e.g., under maximal physiological stimulation) is $S_{0} = 40$ milliequivalents per hour (mEq/h).\n\nDerive, from these assumptions, a closed-form expression for the reduction in secretion $\\Delta S$ in terms of $f$ and $S_{0}$, and then compute the numerical value of $\\Delta S$ for $f = 0.90$ and $S_{0} = 40$.\n\nExpress the final reduction in acid output in milliequivalents per hour (mEq/h), and round your answer to two significant figures.", "solution": "The problem states that gastric acid secretion rate $S$ is directly proportional to the number of active $H^{+}/K^{+}$-ATPase pumps.
