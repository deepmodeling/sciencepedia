All necessary data are provided, and the requested tasks are based on established principles of nuclear physics and their application in medicine.\n\nThe fundamental tenet of radioactive decay is that the rate of decay of a population of radioactive nuclei is proportional to the number of undecayed nuclei, $N(t)$, present at time $t$. This is a first-order kinetic process. The proportionality is expressed through the decay constant, $\\lambda$, which represents the probability per unit time that a single nucleus will decay. The relationship is formulated as a differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -\\lambda N(t)\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the number of undecayed nuclei decreases over time. To find the time dependence of $N(t)$, we solve this first-order linear ordinary differential equation by separation of variables.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N(t)} dN = -\\lambda dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial state (at $t=0$, the number of nuclei is $N_0$) to a later state (at time $t$, the number of nuclei is $N(t)$).\n$$\n\\int_{N_0}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N'} dN' = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\lambda dt'\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln(N')]_{N_0}^{N(t)} = [-\\lambda t']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N_0) = -\\lambda t\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this becomes:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = -\\lambda t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the law of radioactive decay for the number of nuclei:\n$$\nN(t) = N_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nThe problem requires this relationship to be expressed in terms of the half-life, $t_{1/2}$. The half-life is defined as the time required for half of the initial nuclei to decay, meaning at $t = t_{1/2}$, $N(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{N_0}{2}$. Substituting this definition into the decay law:\n$$\n\\frac{N_0}{2} = N_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t_{1/2})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-\\lambda t_{1/2})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\lambda t_{1/2}\n$$\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -\\lambda t_{1/2}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\n$$\nThis equation provides the crucial link between the decay constant and the half-life. Substituting this expression for $\\lambda$ back into the decay law for $N(t)$:\n$$\nN(t) = N_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} t\\right)\n$$\nThe activity, $A(t)$, of a radioactive sample is defined as the magnitude of the rate of decay, $A(t) = \\left|-\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}\\right| = \\lambda N(t)$. At time $t=0$, the initial activity is $A_0 = \\lambda N_0$. Therefore, we can write the activity as a function of time:\n$$\nA(t) = \\lambda \\left(N_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)\\right) = (\\lambda N_0) \\exp(-\\lambda t) = A_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nSubstituting the half-life expression for $\\lambda$ gives the time dependence of activity in the desired form:\n$$\nA(t) = A_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t \\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\\right)\n$$\nThis completes the derivation part of the problem.\n\nNext, we compute the remaining activity of Technetium-99m. The given values are:\nInitial activity, $A_0 = 20\\,\\text{mCi}$\nTime elapsed, $t = 8.0\\,\\text{hours}$\nHalf-life of Tc-99m, $t_{1/2} = 6.01\\,\\text{hours}$\n\nPlugging these values into the derived activity equation:\n$$\nA(8.0\\,\\text{h}) = 20\\,\\text{mCi} \\times \\exp\\left(-\\frac{8.0\\,\\text{h} \\times \\ln(2)}{6.01\\,\\text{h}}\\right)\n$$\nThe time units cancel, leaving a dimensionless exponent as required.\n$$\nA(8.0) = 20 \\times \\exp\\left(-\\frac{8.0}{6.01} \\ln(2)\\right)\n$$\nWe now calculate the numerical value. The exponent is:\n$$\n-\\frac{8.0}{6.01} \\ln(2) \\approx -1.33111 \\times 0.693147 \\approx -0.92241\n$$\nSo the activity is:\n$$\nA(8.0) = 20 \\times \\exp(-0.92241) \\approx 20 \\times 0.39755 \\approx 7.951\\,\\text{mCi}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the remaining activity is $7.95\\,\\text{mCi}$.\n\nFinally, for a brief interpretation, the intraoperative gamma probe count rate is assumed to be proportional to the activity of the radiotracer concentrated in the sentinel lymph node. The activity has decreased from an initial $20\\,\\text{mCi}$ to $7.95\\,\\text{mCi}$ over the $8.0\\,\\text{hour}$ period. This represents a decay to approximately $40\\%$ of the initial activity. Consequently, the gamma probe will detect a signal that is correspondingly weaker than what would have been measured closer to the time of calibration. While this reduction in signal strength is significant, the remaining activity is typically well above background levels, allowing for successful localization. This calculation highlights the importance of temporal planning in nuclear medicine procedures to ensure that the radioactive signal is strong enough for reliable detection at the time of the medical intervention.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7.95}$$", "id": "5182636"}, {"introduction": "Interpreting a diagnostic test result requires moving beyond simple 'positive' or 'negative' labels, as a negative test is not always conclusive.

The entire cohort of $100$ patients in this audit has positive nodal basins.\n-   **Test**: The \"test\" is the pathological examination of the identified sentinel lymph node(s).\n-   **Test Positive**: The SLN is found to be pathologically positive. In this case, the test correctly identifies the disease. These are **True Positives (TP)**.\n-   **Test Negative**: The SLN is found to be pathologically negative. If the basin is truly positive (which it is for all patients in this study, as disease is later found in non-sentinel nodes), this represents a test failure. These are **False Negatives (FN)**.\n\nThe problem explicitly states that the analysis must be restricted \"to basins in which an SLN was identified\". This means we exclude the $5$ basins where mapping failed. The population for our analysis is therefore the $N_{mapped} = 95$ basins where an SLN was successfully identified and examined.\n\nFrom the givens, for this group of $95$ basins:\n-   The number of basins with a pathologically positive SLN is $90$. Since these basins are known to be disease-positive, these are the True Positives.\n    $$\n    TP = 90\n    $$\n-   The number of basins with a pathologically negative SLN but a positive NSLN is $5$. This is the definition of a false-negative result for SLNB.\n    $$\n    FN = 5\n    $$\n\nThe total number of disease-positive subjects *within the analyzed group* (i.e., those who had a successful SLN identification) is the sum of the true positives and the false negatives.\n$$\n\\text{Total with Disease (in analyzed group)} = TP + FN = 90 + 5 = 95\n$$\nThis correctly matches the number of basins where an SLN was identified, $N_{mapped}$.\n\nNow, we can compute the false-negative rate using its definition for this specific cohort:\n$$\n\\text{FNR} = \\frac{FN}{TP + FN}\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\n\\text{FNR} = \\frac{5}{90 + 5} = \\frac{5}{95}\n$$\nTo express this as a decimal fraction, we perform the division:\n$$\n\\frac{5}{95} \\approx 0.0526315789...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
