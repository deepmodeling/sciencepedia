This exercise provides a foundational workout in this essential skill by applying Bayes' theorem to a common diagnostic scenario.

The test characteristic for this positive ultrasound in the relevant population is a positive likelihood ratio $\\mathrm{LR}^{+} = 5$.\n\nStarting from Bayes’ theorem and the definition of a positive likelihood ratio, and proceeding through the odds form of Bayes’ theorem, derive an expression for the post-test probability of malignancy after a positive ultrasound in terms of the pretest probability and $\\mathrm{LR}^{+}$. Then compute the numerical value of the post-test probability for the given parameters.\n\nReport only the post-test probability as a decimal (no percent sign), and round your answer to $4$ significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the post-test probability of a condition given a pretest probability and the positive likelihood ratio of a diagnostic test. We will then compute this probability for the given values.\n\nLet $M$ be the event that malignancy is present, and let $N$ be the event that malignancy is not present (i.e., the lump is benign). Let $T^{+}$ denote the event of a positive test result (a suspicious finding on ultrasound).\n\nThe given information is:\n- The pretest probability of malignancy, $P(M) = 0.20$.\n- The positive likelihood ratio for the ultrasound test, $\\mathrm{LR}^{+} = 5.0$.\n\nOur objective is to find the post-test probability of malignancy, $P(M | T^{+})$.\n\nThe derivation begins with Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$P(M | T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} | M) P(M)}{P(T^{+})}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^{+})$, is the overall probability of a positive test. It can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} | M) P(M) + P(T^{+} | N) P(N)$$\n\nThe definition of the positive likelihood ratio, $\\mathrm{LR}^{+}$, is the ratio of the probability of a positive test in individuals with the condition to the probability of a positive test in individuals without the condition:\n$$\\mathrm{LR}^{+} = \\frac{P(T^{+} | M)}{P(T^{+} | N)}$$\nHere, $P(T^{+} | M)$ is the sensitivity of the test, and $P(T^{+} | N)$ is the false positive rate.\n\nThe problem requires proceeding via the odds form of Bayes' theorem. Let us define the pretest and post-test odds of malignancy.\nThe pretest odds are the ratio of the probability of having the condition to the probability of not having it, before the test is performed:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(M)}{P(N)} = \\frac{P(M)}{1 - P(M)}$$\n\nThe post-test odds are the ratio of the probability of having the condition to the probability of not having it, after accounting for a positive test result:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text post} = \\frac{P(M | T^{+})}{P(N | T^{+})}$$\n\nWe can derive the relationship between post-test and pretest odds. Using Bayes' theorem for both $P(M | T^{+})$ and $P(N | T^{+})$:\n$$P(M | T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} | M) P(M)}{P(T^{+})}$$\n$$P(N | T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} | N) P(N)}{P(T^{+})}$$\nDividing these two expressions gives the post-test odds:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text post} = \\frac{P(M | T^{+})}{P(N | T^{+})} = \\frac{P(T^{+} | M) P(M) / P(T^{+})}{P(T^{+} | N) P(N) / P(T^{+})} = \\frac{P(T^{+} | M)}{P(T^{+} | N)} \\times \\frac{P(M)}{P(N)}$$\nRecognizing the terms on the right-hand side, we arrive at the odds form of Bayes' theorem:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text post} = \\mathrm{LR}^{+} \\times \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}}$$\n\nThis equation shows that the post-test odds are simply the pretest odds multiplied by the likelihood ratio.\n\nNow, we derive the expression for the post-test probability, $P(M|T^{+})$, in terms of the pretest probability, $P(M)$, and $\\mathrm{LR}^{+}$.\nFirst, we establish the relationship between probability and odds. If a probability of an event is $p$, the odds are $\\frac{p}{1-p}$. Conversely, if the odds are $O$, the probability is $p = \\frac{O}{1+O}$.\nApplying this to the post-test probability:\n$$P(M|T^{+}) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text post}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text post}}$$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\text{Odds}_{\\text post}$:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text post} = \\mathrm{LR}^{+} \\times \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\mathrm{LR}^{+} \\times \\frac{P(M)}{1 - P(M)}$$\n$$P(M|T^{+}) = \\frac{\\mathrm{LR}^{+} \\left( \\frac{P(M)}{1-P(M)} \\right)}{1 + \\mathrm{LR}^{+} \\left( \\frac{P(M)}{1-P(M)} \\right)}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $(1 - P(M))$:\n$$P(M|T^{+}) = \\frac{\\mathrm{LR}^{+} P(M)}{(1 - P(M)) + \\mathrm{LR}^{+} P(M)}$$\nThis is the desired expression for the post-test probability in terms of pretest probability and the positive likelihood ratio.\n\nNow, we can compute the numerical value using the given parameters: $P(M) = 0.20$ and $\\mathrm{LR}^{+} = 5$.\nFirst, calculate the pretest odds:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(M)}{1 - P(M)} = \\frac{0.20}{1 - 0.20} = \\frac{0.20}{0.80} = 0.25$$\nNext, calculate the post-test odds:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text post} = \\mathrm{LR}^{+} \\times \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = 5 \\times 0.25 = 1.25$$\nFinally, convert the post-test odds back to probability:\n$$P(M|T^{+}) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text post}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text post}} = \\frac{1.25}{1 + 1.25} = \\frac{1.25}{2.25}$$\nTo compute the value:\n$$P(M|T^{+}) = \\frac{1.25}{2.25} = \\frac{125}{225} = \\frac{5 \\times 25}{9 \\times 25} = \\frac{5}{9}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $5 \\div 9 \\approx 0.555555...$\nThe problem requires rounding to $4$ significant figures.\nThe first four significant figures are $5$, $5$, $5$, $5$.

It is scientifically grounded in Bayesian decision theory and expected-loss analysis, which are standard frameworks for medical decision-making under uncertainty. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and models explicitly defined. The language is objective and the setup is internally consistent.\n\nThe task is to derive an optimal decision rule for managing a discordant benign Core Needle Biopsy (CNB) result based on the post-biopsy (posterior) probability of malignancy, $p_1$. The choice is between immediate surgical excision and a repeat vacuum-assisted biopsy. The optimal decision minimizes the expected loss.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the posterior probability of malignancy, $p_1$, given a benign CNB result. Let $C$ denote the event that cancer is present, and $NC$ denote the event that cancer is not present. The pretest probability is $p_0 = \\Pr(C)$. A discordant benign CNB is modeled as a negative test result, which we denote as $T_d^-$. We are given the sensitivity $s_d = \\Pr(\\text{positive test} | C) = 0.75$ and specificity $sp_d = \\Pr(\\text{negative test} | NC) = 0.95$ for the discordant CNB.\n\nThe required posterior probability is $p_1 = \\Pr(C | T_d^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ p_1 = \\frac{\\Pr(T_d^- | C) \\cdot \\Pr(C)}{\\Pr(T_d^-)} $$\nThe term $\\Pr(T_d^- | C)$ is the false negative rate, which is $1 - s_d$. The total probability of a negative test, $\\Pr(T_d^-)$, is given by the law of total probability:\n$$ \\Pr(T_d^-) = \\Pr(T_d^- | C) \\cdot \\Pr(C) + \\Pr(T_d^- | NC) \\cdot \\Pr(NC) $$\n$$ \\Pr(T_d^-) = (1 - s_d) p_0 + sp_d (1 - p_0) $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $p_1$:\n$$ p_1 = \\frac{(1 - s_d) p_0}{(1 - s_d) p_0 + sp_d (1 - p_0)} $$\nUsing the given values $s_d = 0.75$ and $sp_d = 0.95$:\n$$ p_1 = \\frac{(1 - 0.75) p_0}{(1 - 0.75) p_0 + 0.95 (1 - p_0)} = \\frac{0.25 p_0}{0.25 p_0 + 0.95 - 0.95 p_0} = \\frac{0.25 p_0}{0.95 - 0.70 p_0} $$\n\nNext, we establish the expected loss for each of the two possible actions, based on the posterior probability $p_1$.\n\n1.  **Expected Loss of Immediate Surgical Excision, $L(E)$**:\n    Surgical excision has a cost $C_E = 10$. This cost is incurred whether cancer is present or not. The key benefit is that it averts the cost of delay, $C_d$, if cancer is indeed present.\n    $$ L(E) = p_1 \\cdot C_E + (1 - p_1) \\cdot C_E = C_E $$\n    Thus, $L(E) = 10$.\n\n2.  **Expected Loss of Repeat Vacuum-Assisted Biopsy, $L(R)$**:\n    This action begins with the cost of the repeat biopsy, $C_R=3$.

The repeat biopsy has sensitivity $s_2 = 0.95$ and specificity $sp_2 = 0.90$.\n    The expected loss is the sum of the initial cost and the expectation of all downstream costs:\n    $$ L(R) = C_R + p_1 \\cdot (\\text{Expected cost if cancer is present}) + (1 - p_1) \\cdot (\\text{Expected cost if cancer is absent}) $$\n    - If cancer is present (probability $p_1$):\n        - A positive repeat biopsy (probability $s_2 = 0.95$) leads to surgical excision (cost $C_E = 10$).\n        - A negative repeat biopsy (probability $1 - s_2 = 0.05$) leads to follow-up ($C_F = 1$) but tragically incurs the delay cost ($C_d = 50$).\n        - Expected downstream cost if cancer: $s_2 C_E + (1 - s_2)(C_F + C_d) = 0.95(10) + 0.05(1 + 50) = 9.5 + 2.55 = 12.05$.\n    - If cancer is absent (probability $1 - p_1$):\n        - A positive repeat biopsy (false positive, probability $1 - sp_2 = 0.10$) leads to unnecessary excision ($C_E = 10$).\n        - A negative repeat biopsy (true negative, probability $sp_2 = 0.90$) leads to follow-up ($C_F = 1$).\n        - Expected downstream cost if no cancer: $(1 - sp_2)C_E + sp_2 C_F = 0.10(10) + 0.90(1) = 1 + 0.9 = 1.9$.\n    \n    Combining these components:\n    $$ L(R) = C_R + p_1 [s_2 C_E + (1 - s_2)(C_F + C_d)] + (1 - p_1) [(1 - sp_2)C_E + sp_2 C_F] $$\n    $$ L(R) = 3 + p_1(12.05) + (1 - p_1)(1.9) $$\n    $$ L(R) = 3 + 12.05 p_1 + 1.9 - 1.9 p_1 $$\n    $$ L(R) = 4.9 + 10.15 p_1 $$\n\nThe decision threshold, $p_T$, is the value of $p_1$ at which the expected losses of the two actions are equal: $L(E) = L(R)$.\n$$ 10 = 4.9 + 10.15 p_T $$\n$$ 5.1 = 10.15 p_T $$\n$$ p_T = \\frac{5.1}{10.15} \\approx 0.50246 $$\n\nThe decision rule is as follows:\n- If $p_1 < p_T$, choose Repeat Biopsy, as $L(R) < L(E)$.\n- If $p_1 > p_T$, choose Surgical Excision, as $L(E) < L(R)$.\n\nNow, we apply this rule to the specified BI-RADS categories by first calculating $p_1$ for each.\n\n- **For BI-RADS $4\\text{a}$ ($p_0 = 0.20$):**\n  $$ p_1 = \\frac{0.25(0.20)}{0.95 - 0.70(0.20)} = \\frac{0.05}{0.95 - 0.14} = \\frac{0.05}{0.81} \\approx 0.0617 $$\n  Since $0.0617 < p_T \\approx 0.5025$, the optimal action is **Repeat Biopsy**.\n\n- **For BI-RADS $4\\text{b}$ ($p_0 = 0.50$):**\n  $$ p_1 = \\frac{0.25(0.50)}{0.95 - 0.70(0.50)} = \\frac{0.125}{0.95 - 0.35} = \\frac{0.125}{0.60} = \\frac{5}{24} \\approx 0.2083 $$\n  Since $0.2083 < p_T \\approx 0.5025$, the optimal action is **Repeat Biopsy**.\n\n- **For BI-RADS $4\\text{c}/5$ ($p_0 = 0.85$):**\n  $$ p_1 = \\frac{0.25(0.85)}{0.95 - 0.70(0.85)} = \\frac{0.2125}{0.95 - 0.595} = \\frac{0.2125}{0.355} = \\frac{85}{142} \\approx 0.5986 $$\n  Since $0.5986 > p_T \\approx 0.5025$, the optimal action is **Surgical Excision**.\n\nNow, we evaluate each of the provided options:\n\n**A.
