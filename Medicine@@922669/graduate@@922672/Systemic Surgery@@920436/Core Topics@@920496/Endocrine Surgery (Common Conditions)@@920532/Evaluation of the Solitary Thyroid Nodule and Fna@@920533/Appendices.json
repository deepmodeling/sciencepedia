{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The initial step in evaluating a thyroid nodule is to stratify its risk of malignancy using ultrasonography. The American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS) provides a standardized framework for this purpose by assigning points to specific sonographic features. This practice allows you to apply the TI-RADS rubric to a described nodule, translating qualitative findings into a quantitative score and risk category that directly informs the decision to perform a Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA) [@problem_id:5121565].", "problem": "A solitary thyroid nodule is being evaluated with ultrasonography as part of risk stratification guiding Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA). The nodule is described as solid, very hypoechoic, with irregular margins, punctate echogenic foci consistent with microcalcifications, and a taller-than-wide shape on the transverse plane. Using the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) rubric from the American College of Radiology (ACR), compute the total point score and the final category for this nodule. Express the final category as the integer $k$ such that the category is $\\mathrm{TR}k$. Provide the final result as a row matrix with two entries: first the total points and second the category integer $k$. No rounding is required. The context base for your derivation must be the established ACR TI-RADS point assignment rules across the five ultrasound feature groups (composition, echogenicity, shape, margin, and echogenic foci), which are considered well-tested clinical guidelines for the evaluation of solitary thyroid nodules in systemic surgery practice.", "solution": "The problem is deemed valid after rigorous evaluation. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The task is to apply the American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) to a solitary thyroid nodule with specified ultrasonographic features to determine its total point score and risk category. The solution will proceed by systematically assigning points for each of the five feature categories as defined by the ACR TI-RADS rubric.\n\nThe total point score, which we may denote as $S_{total}$, is the sum of points from five distinct categories: composition ($P_C$), echogenicity ($P_E$), shape ($P_S$), margin ($P_M$), and echogenic foci ($P_{EF}$).\n$$S_{total} = P_C + P_E + P_S + P_M + P_{EF}$$\n\nThe problem provides the following descriptive features for the nodule:\n$1$. **Composition**: The nodule is described as `solid`. According to the ACR TI-RADS, a solid or almost completely solid composition is assigned $P_C = 2$ points.\n\n$2$. **Echogenicity**: The nodule is `very hypoechoic`. In the TI-RADS system, this feature is assigned $P_E = 3$ points. This assessment is applicable as the nodule is not spongiform or purely cystic.\n\n$3$. **Shape**: The nodule is described as having a `taller-than-wide shape` on the transverse imaging plane. This is considered a highly suspicious feature and is assigned $P_S = 3$ points.\n\n$4$. **Margin**: The nodule exhibits `irregular margins`. The ACR TI-RADS assigns $P_M = 2$ points for lobulated or irregular margins. This is distinct from smooth or ill-defined margins ($0$ points) and extrathyroidal extension ($3$ points).\n\n$5$. **Echogenic Foci**: The nodule presents with `punctate echogenic foci`, which are consistent with microcalcifications. This is the highest-risk type of echogenic focus and is assigned $P_{EF} = 3$ points.\n\nNow, we compute the total point score, $S_{total}$, by summing the points from each category:\n$$S_{total} = P_C + P_E + P_S + P_M + P_{EF} = 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3$$\n$$S_{total} = 13$$\n\nThe next step is to determine the final TI-RADS category based on the total score $S_{total}$. The ACR TI-RADS levels are defined as follows:\n-   $\\mathrm{TR}1$ (Benign): $S_{total} = 0$ points\n-   $\\mathrm{TR}2$ (Not Suspicious): $S_{total} = 2$ points (Note: must be spongiform to be TR2)\n-   $\\mathrm{TR}3$ (Mildly Suspicious): $S_{total} = 3$ points\n-   $\\mathrm{TR}4$ (Moderately Suspicious): $S_{total} \\in \\{4, 5, 6\\}$ points\n-   $\\mathrm{TR}5$ (Highly Suspicious): $S_{total} \\ge 7$ points\n\nOur calculated total score is $S_{total} = 13$. Since $13 \\ge 7$, the nodule is classified as $\\mathrm{TR}5$ (Highly Suspicious).\n\nThe problem requires expressing the final category as the integer $k$ such that the category is $\\mathrm{TR}k$. For the $\\mathrm{TR}5$ category, the integer is $k=5$.\n\nThe final result is to be provided as a row matrix containing the total points and the category integer $k$. Therefore, the two entries are the total score, $S_{total} = 13$, and the category integer, $k = 5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 13 & 5 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5121565"}, {"introduction": "Once a Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA) is performed, interpreting its result requires understanding the test's characteristics.

A key trigger for re-evaluation or repeat biopsy is evidence of significant growth, but 'growth' must be defined precisely. This practice challenges you to apply the American Thyroid Association's (ATA) specific, multi-faceted criteria for significant growth—involving both dimensional and volumetric changes—to make a definitive clinical decision about the need for repeat FNA [@problem_id:5121618].", "problem": "A patient with a solitary thyroid nodule undergoes ultrasound surveillance. At baseline, the three orthogonal diameters are measured as $12$ millimeters, $10$ millimeters, and $9$ millimeters. At follow-up, the same diameters are measured as $15$ millimeters, $12$ millimeters, and $10$ millimeters. Assume measurements are reproducible and unbiased.\n\nIn clinical thyroid ultrasound, an ellipsoid model is commonly used to estimate nodule volume. The ellipsoid volume formula is $$V=\\frac{\\pi}{6}a b c,$$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the three orthogonal diameters. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) uses growth thresholds to determine whether repeat Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA) is indicated when cytology is initially benign or indeterminate, based on ultrasound follow-up. Two widely used growth thresholds are:\n- Dimension-based growth: at least two of the three diameters must each increase by at least $0.20$ relative to their baseline values and by at least $2$ millimeters in absolute change.\n- Volume-based growth: the follow-up volume must exceed the baseline volume by at least $0.50$ of the baseline (that is, the fractional volume increase is at least $0.50$).\n\nLet $D$ be a decision indicator defined as $D=1$ if either the dimension-based growth threshold or the volume-based growth threshold is met, and $D=0$ otherwise.\n\nUsing only these definitions and the provided measurements, compute $D$. No rounding is required. Express the final answer as the single number $D$ without units.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, providing a clear algorithm for determining the decision indicator $D$. The solution proceeds by systematically applying the given definitions to the provided data.\n\nFirst, let us denote the baseline and follow-up diameters. The problem states the baseline orthogonal diameters are $12$ millimeters, $10$ millimeters, and $9$ millimeters. The corresponding follow-up diameters are $15$ millimeters, $12$ millimeters, and $10$ millimeters. We can logically pair these measurements. Let the baseline diameters be $(a_0, b_0, c_0)$ and the follow-up diameters be $(a_1, b_1, c_1)$. We have:\n- $a_0 = 12$ mm, $a_1 = 15$ mm\n- $b_0 = 10$ mm, $b_1 = 12$ mm\n- $c_0 = 9$ mm, $c_1 = 10$ mm\n\nThe decision indicator $D$ is $1$ if either the dimension-based growth threshold or the volume-based growth threshold is met, and $0$ otherwise. We must evaluate each threshold.\n\nEvaluation of Dimension-Based Growth:\nThe criterion for dimension-based growth is that at least two of the three diameters must each increase by at least $0.20$ (or $20\\%$) relative to their baseline values AND by at least $2$ millimeters in absolute change. We will analyze each dimension pair.\n\nFor dimension $a$:\nThe absolute change is $\\Delta a = a_1 - a_0 = 15 - 12 = 3$ mm. This satisfies the condition $\\Delta a \\ge 2$ mm, since $3 \\ge 2$.\nThe relative change is $\\frac{\\Delta a}{a_0} = \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$. This satisfies the condition $\\frac{\\Delta a}{a_0} \\ge 0.20$, since $0.25 \\ge 0.20$.\nSince both conditions are met, dimension $a$ shows significant growth.\n\nFor dimension $b$:\nThe absolute change is $\\Delta b = b_1 - b_0 = 12 - 10 = 2$ mm. This satisfies the condition $\\Delta b \\ge 2$ mm, since $2 \\ge 2$.\nThe relative change is $\\frac{\\Delta b}{b_0} = \\frac{2}{10} = 0.20$. This satisfies the condition $\\frac{\\Delta b}{b_0} \\ge 0.20$, since $0.20 \\ge 0.20$.\nSince both conditions are met, dimension $b$ shows significant growth.\n\nFor dimension $c$:\nThe absolute change is $\\Delta c = c_1 - c_0 = 10 - 9 = 1$ mm. This does not satisfy the condition $\\Delta c \\ge 2$ mm, since $1 < 2$.\nBecause one of the two required conditions for growth in this dimension is not met, dimension $c$ does not show significant growth.\n\nWe have found that two dimensions ($a$ and $b$) meet the criteria for significant growth. Since the threshold requires at least two dimensions to show growth, the dimension-based growth criterion is met.\n\nEvaluation of Volume-Based Growth:\nThe criterion for volume-based growth is that the follow-up volume must exceed the baseline volume by at least $0.50$ of the baseline. This can be expressed as $\\frac{V_1 - V_0}{V_0} \\ge 0.50$, where $V_0$ is the baseline volume and $V_1$ is the follow-up volume. The volume of an ellipsoid is given by the formula $V=\\frac{\\pi}{6}abc$.\n\nThe baseline volume $V_0$ is:\n$$V_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{6} a_0 b_0 c_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{6} (12)(10)(9) = \\frac{1080\\pi}{6} = 180\\pi \\text{ mm}^3$$\n\nThe follow-up volume $V_1$ is:\n$$V_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{6} a_1 b_1 c_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{6} (15)(12)(10) = \\frac{1800\\pi}{6} = 300\\pi \\text{ mm}^3$$\n\nNow, we calculate the fractional volume increase:\n$$\\frac{V_1 - V_0}{V_0} = \\frac{300\\pi - 180\\pi}{180\\pi} = \\frac{120\\pi}{180\\pi} = \\frac{120}{180} = \\frac{12}{18} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nTo compare this with the threshold, we can convert the fractions to decimals or compare them directly. The threshold is $0.50 = \\frac{1}{2}$. We need to check if $\\frac{2}{3} \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince $2 \\times 2 = 4$ and $3 \\times 1 = 3$, we have $4 > 3$, which implies $\\frac{2}{3} > \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSpecifically, $\\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.667$, which is greater than $0.50$.\nTherefore, the volume-based growth criterion is also met.\n\nDetermination of the Decision Indicator $D$:\nThe decision indicator $D$ is defined as $1$ if either the dimension-based growth threshold or the volume-based growth threshold is met.\n- Dimension-based growth threshold: Met.\n- Volume-based growth threshold: Met.\n\nSince at least one of these conditions is met (in this case, both are), the value of the decision indicator is $D=1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "5121618"}]}
