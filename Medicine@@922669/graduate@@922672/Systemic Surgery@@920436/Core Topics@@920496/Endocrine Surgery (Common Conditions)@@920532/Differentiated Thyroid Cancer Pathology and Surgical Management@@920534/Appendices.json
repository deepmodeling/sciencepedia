Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA) cytology returns a Bethesda category V result (“suspicious for malignancy”), which for the purposes of this decision is treated as a binary positive test for malignancy. Assume that, when compared with the histopathologic reference standard for differentiated thyroid carcinoma, Bethesda V cytology has sensitivity $0.90$ and specificity $0.75$.\n\nUsing Bayes’ theorem and only the definitions of sensitivity, specificity, pretest probability, and conditional probability, compute the post-test probability of malignancy given this Bethesda V result.

The pretest probability of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (malignancy), which we denote as $P(M)$, is $0.40$.\n2.  The diagnostic test (FNA cytology with a Bethesda V result) is treated as a binary positive test result, denoted as $T+$.\n3.  The sensitivity of the test, defined as the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the malignancy, is $P(T+|M) = 0.90$.\n4.  The specificity of the test, defined as the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the malignancy, is $P(T-|M^c) = 0.75$. Here, $M^c$ denotes the event that the patient does not have malignancy.\n\nThe problem is valid. It is a direct application of Bayes' theorem, a fundamental principle of probability theory, to a standard problem in medical diagnostics. All necessary information is provided, the data are consistent, and the question is unambiguous.\n\nThe objective is to compute the post-test probability of malignancy given the positive test result, which is the conditional probability $P(M|T+)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, this probability is given by:\n$$P(M|T+) = \\frac{P(T+|M) P(M)}{P(T+)}$$\nThe terms in the numerator are given directly in the problem:\n-   $P(T+|M) = 0.90$ (sensitivity)\n-   $P(M) = 0.40$ (pretest probability)\n\nThe denominator, $P(T+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+|M) P(M) + P(T+|M^c) P(M^c)$$\nTo compute $P(T+)$, we need the values of $P(M^c)$ and $P(T+|M^c)$.\n\nFirst, $P(M^c)$ is the probability that the patient does not have the malignancy. This is the complement of the pretest probability of malignancy:\n$$P(M^c) = 1 - P(M) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$$\nNext, $P(T+|M^c)$ is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient does not have the malignancy. This is often called the false positive rate. It can be derived from the specificity, $P(T-|M^c)$, since a test result is either positive or negative:\n$$P(T+|M^c) = 1 - P(T-|M^c) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$$\nNow we have all the components to calculate the total probability of a positive test, $P(T+)$:\n$$P(T+) = (0.90)(0.40) + (0.25)(0.60)$$\n$$P(T+) = 0.36 + 0.15 = 0.51$$\nFinally, we can substitute the values back into Bayes' theorem to find the post-test probability of malignancy, $P(M|T+)$:\n$$P(M|T+) = \\frac{P(T+|M) P(M)}{P(T+)} = \\frac{(0.90)(0.40)}{0.51} = \\frac{0.36}{0.51}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$P(M|T+) \\approx 0.70588235...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(M|T+) \\approx 0.7059$$\nThis is the post-test probability of malignancy given the Bethesda V cytology result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7059}$$", "id": "5110138"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis of differentiated thyroid cancer is established, the next crucial step is staging the disease to predict its behavior and guide treatment.

This is the fundamental principle of the AJCC $8$th edition for this age group. The general rule is that *any* DTC (intrathyroidal or not) in a patient $ 55$ years old without distant metastasis is Stage I. The rationale's focus on \"intrathyroidal tumor\" is a correct, though not exhaustive, application of this rule to the current case.

The tumor is $1.5$ $\\mathrm{cm}$, which is $\\mathrm{T1b}$, not $\\mathrm{T1a}$.\n- **Rationale**: While the components of the rationale are factually correct statements (the definition of $\\mathrm{T1a}$ and the staging rule for age $55$ with $\\mathrm{M0}$), the $\\mathrm{T1a}$ definition is misapplied to this patient's $1.5$ $\\mathrm{cm}$ tumor.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The initial staging is wrong.\n\n**C. $\\mathrm{T1bN0M0}$; Stage $\\mathrm{II}$; rationale: nodal status upstages to at least Stage $\\mathrm{II}$ irrespective of age.**\n- **TNM and Stage**: The Stage is incorrect. The patient is Stage $\\mathrm{I}$.\n- **Rationale**: The rationale is fundamentally incorrect. First, this patient is $\\mathrm{N0}$, so nodal status does not cause upstaging. Second, even if the patient were $\\mathrm{N1}$, being $ 55$ years old and $\\mathrm{M0}$ would still result in Stage $\\mathrm{I}$.

The tumor is $1.5$ $\\mathrm{cm}$, which is $\\mathrm{T1b}$, not $\\mathrm{T2}$.\n- **Rationale**: Similar to option B, while parts of the rationale are factually correct (the definition of $\\mathrm{T2}$ and the staging rule for age), the $\\mathrm{T2}$ definition is misapplied to this patient's tumor.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.

The patient is Stage $\\mathrm{I}$.\n- **Rationale**: The rationale is incorrect on two counts. First, the patient does not have extrathyroidal extension. Second, the statement itself is false. In a patient $ 55$ years old, even a tumor with gross extrathyroidal extension (e.g., T4) is still Stage $\\mathrm{I}$ as long as it is $\\mathrm{M0}$.
