The problem states that Class III hemorrhage corresponds to a blood loss fraction between $0.30$ and $0.40$ of EBV. We are instructed to use the midpoint of this range for the point estimate.\n$$f_{loss} = \\frac{0.30 + 0.40}{2} = 0.35$$\nThis fraction is dimensionless.\n\nNow, we calculate the hemorrhage volume for each patient, which is the product of their respective EBV and the blood loss fraction $f_{loss}$.\n\nHemorrhage volume for Patient A, $V_{loss, A}$:\n$$V_{loss, A} = EBV_A \\times f_{loss} = 5250\\ \\mathrm{mL} \\times 0.35 = 1837.5\\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nHemorrhage volume for Patient B, $V_{loss, B}$:\n$$V_{loss, B} = EBV_B \\times f_{loss} = 3900\\ \\mathrm{mL} \\times 0.35 = 1365\\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThe combined hemorrhage volume, $V_{total}$, is the sum of the individual hemorrhage volumes:\n$$V_{total} = V_{loss, A} + V_{loss, B} = 1837.5\\ \\mathrm{mL} + 1365\\ \\mathrm{mL} = 3202.5\\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be in liters.

The assumptions, such as modeling blood as a Newtonian fluid and the artery as a rigid cylindrical conduit, are standard simplifications for creating a tractable biophysical model.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the relationship between the volumetric bleeding rate, $Q$, and the pressure gradient, based on first principles for steady, laminar flow in a cylindrical conduit. This scenario is described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. We shall derive this equation.\n\nFirst, consider a force balance on a cylindrical element of fluid of radius $\\rho$ (where $0 \\le \\rho \\le r$) and length $L$, coaxial with the pipe. The flow is driven by a pressure difference, $\\Delta P = P_{in} - P_{out}$, along the length $L$. For a steady flow, the net force on the fluid element is zero.

The problem states the outlet pressure is atmospheric, so we can set $P_{out} = 0$ in gauge pressure. Thus, $\\Delta P = P_{in}$.\n\nLet $Q_1$ be the bleeding rate corresponding to the initial mean arterial pressure $P_1$, and $Q_2$ be the rate corresponding to the reduced pressure $P_2$.

The assumptions provided (e.g., no ongoing hemorrhage, no fibrinogen synthesis or consumption) are necessary simplifications to create a tractable, idealized model for calculating the specific effect of dilution.\n\nThe solution to this problem is governed by the principle of conservation of mass for the coagulation factor fibrinogen. The total mass of fibrinogen in the system remains constant, as it is assumed that none is added with the transfused packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and none is consumed or synthesized during the interval. The final concentration is this conserved mass distributed over the new, larger plasma volume.\n\nLet us define the initial state of the system with the subscript '$i$' and the final state with the subscript '$f$'.\n\nThe initial parameters are:\n- Initial total blood volume: $V_{\\text{blood}, i} = 5$ L\n- Initial hematocrit: $Hct_{i} = 0.40$\n- Initial plasma fibrinogen concentration: $C_{\\text{fib}, i} = 250$ mg/dL\n\nThe parameters of the transfused fluid are:\n- Number of PRBC units: $N_{\\text{PRBC}} = 6$\n- Volume per PRBC unit: $V_{\\text{unit}} = 0.300$ L\n- Hematocrit of a PRBC unit: $Hct_{\\text{PRBC}} = 0.60$\n- Fibrinogen mass in the transfused units: $m_{\\text{fib, added}} = 0$ mg\n\nFirst, we calculate the volume of the plasma component in the initial state.
