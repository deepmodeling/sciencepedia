This exercise demonstrates how to move beyond a simple positive or negative result by using Bayes' theorem to quantify the impact of a test on our diagnostic certainty. By calculating the positive likelihood ratio and the posterior probability, you will learn to formally update your clinical suspicion, a cornerstone of evidence-based medicine [@problem_id:5182369].", "problem": "During the secondary survey of a hemodynamically stable adult with high-risk blunt head-and-neck trauma, a Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA) of the neck is obtained to evaluate for Blunt Cerebrovascular Injury (BCVI). Suppose the CTA, used as a diagnostic imaging modality in this trauma context, has sensitivity $0.80$ and specificity $0.98$ for clinically significant BCVI. Based on the mechanism and injury pattern, your estimated pretest probability of BCVI is $0.10$. Using only the core definitions of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and Bayes’ theorem in odds form, compute the positive likelihood ratio $LR_{+}$ and the posterior probability of BCVI after a positive CTA. Then, briefly interpret what these values imply for management decisions during the secondary survey and subsequent diagnostic pathway, including whether confirmatory imaging or immediate antithrombotic therapy is favored. Round both $LR_{+}$ and the posterior probability to four significant figures. Express the posterior probability as a decimal fraction (not a percentage).", "solution": "Let $D$ be the event that the patient has a clinically significant Blunt Cerebrovascular Injury (BCVI), and let $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have BCVI. Let $T$ represent a positive test result from the Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA), and $T^c$ a negative result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following values:\n- The sensitivity of the CTA, which is the probability of a positive test given the presence of the disease: $S_n = P(T|D) = 0.80$.\n- The specificity of the CTA, which is the probability of a negative test given the absence of the disease: $S_p = P(T^c|D^c) = 0.98$.\n- The pretest probability of BCVI, which is the initial estimate of the probability of disease before the test is performed: $P(D) = 0.10$.\n\nOur first task is to compute the positive likelihood ratio, denoted as $LR_{+}$. The $LR_{+}$ quantifies how much more likely a positive test result is in a patient with the disease compared to a patient without the disease. It is defined as the ratio of the true positive rate (sensitivity) to the false positive rate ($1 - \\text{specificity}$).\n\nThe false positive rate is the probability of a positive test in a patient who does not have the disease, $P(T|D^c)$. This is calculated as:\n$$P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - S_p = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the positive likelihood ratio, $LR_{+}$:\n$$LR_{+} = \\frac{\\text{sensitivity}}{1 - \\text{specificity}} = \\frac{P(T|D)}{P(T|D^c)} = \\frac{0.80}{0.02} = 40$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we have $LR_{+} = 40.00$.\n\nOur second task is to compute the posterior probability of BCVI given a positive CTA result, $P(D|T)$, using Bayes' theorem in odds form. The theorem states:\n$$\\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Pretest Odds} \\times \\text{Likelihood Ratio}$$\n\nFirst, we convert the pretest probability, $P(D)$, into pretest odds. The odds of an event are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring.\n$$\\text{Pretest Odds} = \\frac{P(D)}{1 - P(D)}$$\nGiven $P(D) = 0.10$, we have $1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n$$\\text{Pretest Odds} = \\frac{0.10}{0.90} = \\frac{1}{9}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the posterior odds by multiplying the pretest odds by the positive likelihood ratio, $LR_{+}$, since the test result was positive.\n$$\\text{Posterior Odds}(D|T) = \\text{Pretest Odds} \\times LR_{+} = \\frac{1}{9} \\times 40 = \\frac{40}{9}$$\n\nFinally, we convert the posterior odds back into a probability. The formula for converting odds to probability is:\n$$\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}}{1 + \\text{Odds}}$$\nTherefore, the posterior probability $P(D|T)$ is:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{\\frac{40}{9}}{1 + \\frac{40}{9}} = \\frac{\\frac{40}{9}}{\\frac{9}{9} + \\frac{40}{9}} = \\frac{\\frac{40}{9}}{\\frac{49}{9}} = \\frac{40}{49}$$\n\nTo express this as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{40}{49} \\approx 0.8163265... \\approx 0.8163$$\n\nThus, the posterior probability of BCVI after a positive CTA is $0.8163$.\n\nFor the interpretation, the calculated $LR_{+}$ of $40.00$ is a large value, indicating that a positive CTA is a strong piece of evidence in favor of the diagnosis of BCVI. The posterior probability of $0.8163$ represents a substantial increase from the pretest probability of $0.10$. This result moves the diagnosis from a low probability to a high probability. However, in the context of initiating a high-risk treatment like antithrombotic therapy in a trauma patient, a residual uncertainty of $1 - 0.8163 = 0.1837$, or approximately $18.4\\%$, may still be considered too high to proceed without definitive confirmation. The decision hinges on the clinical trade-off between the risk of stroke from an untreated BCVI and the risk of hemorrhage from antithrombotic therapy in a potentially false-positive case. A posterior probability of $81.63\\%$ typically falls into a diagnostic gray zone where the risk of misdiagnosis is not negligible. Consequently, this result strongly favors obtaining a more definitive confirmatory imaging study, such as Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA), which remains the gold standard. Immediate antithrombotic therapy would be a more aggressive stance, while inaction would be imprudent given the high probability. Therefore, the most justified management decision is to pursue confirmatory imaging.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 40.00  0.8163 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5182369"}, {"introduction": "Clinical decisions are rarely based on a single data point; instead, they emerge from the synthesis of multiple pieces of evidence.
