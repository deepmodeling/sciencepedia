The relationship between the volume of fluid in the sac and the pressure it exerts is governed by the pericardium's compliance ($C$), its capacity to stretch. This exercise demonstrates why acute hemopericardium is so lethal: the pericardium has no time to stretch, resulting in low compliance, where even a small volume of blood causes a massive pressure increase. By calculating the volume removal needed for pressure relief in acute versus subacute scenarios, you will gain a quantitative understanding of the core pathophysiology of cardiac tamponade and the rationale for urgent decompression in trauma [@problem_id:5168400].", "problem": "A patient with subacute malignant pericardial effusion exhibits a locally linear segment of the pericardial pressure–volume curve such that the pericardial compliance near the operating point is approximately $C_{\\text{subacute}}=5~\\text{mL/mmHg}$.

A small reduction in pericardial volume (here, $5~\\text{mL}$) produces a large reduction in pericardial pressure, rapidly improving right ventricular diastolic filling and cardiac output. This high sensitivity justifies urgent decompression in the emergency department, often via emergency department thoracotomy with direct pericardial drainage when cardiac arrest or profound hemodynamic instability is present, because even minimal evacuation can be lifesaving.\n- In subacute effusion, the pericardium is more compliant (here, $5~\\text{mL/mmHg}$), so a larger volume must be removed (here, $25~\\text{mL}$) to achieve the same pressure reduction. This supports the practice of controlled pericardiocentesis and catheter drainage, recognizing that while effective, the pressure response per milliliter is less dramatic, and larger cumulative drainage may be needed to reverse tamponade physiology.\n\nThus, the computed row matrix of required volume changes is $\\begin{pmatrix}25  5\\end{pmatrix}$, in milliliters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}25  5\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "5168400"}, {"introduction": "Successfully relieving tamponade restores cardiac output, but the fundamental goal of resuscitation is to re-establish adequate oxygen delivery to vital tissues.
