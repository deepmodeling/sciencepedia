It is scientifically grounded in operations research and queueing theory, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively formulated. There are no violations of fundamental principles, contradictions, or ambiguities. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to derive a capacity stress test metric, the surge exceedance factor $S$, and compute its value. The factor $S$ is defined as the ratio of demand to capacity over a finite time horizon $T$.\n\nFirst, we identify the given parameters:\n-   Demand (number of arriving cases): $N = 25$\n-   Time horizon: $T = 60$ minutes\n-   Number of servers (Operating Rooms): $c = 2$\n-   Average surgical time per case: $\\tau_{s} = 90$ minutes\n-   Average turnover time between cases: $\\tau_{t} = 30$ minutes\n\nThe surge exceedance factor $S$ is defined as:\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\text{Demand}}{\\text{Capacity}}\n$$\n\nThe demand, measured in cases, is explicitly given as $N$.\n$$\n\\text{Demand} = N\n$$\n\nThe capacity must be derived from first principles as specified. Capacity is defined as the number of case-equivalents that can be processed during the horizon $T$. This is determined by the total available processing time and the time required to process a single case.\n\nFirst, we determine the mean cycle time per case, $\\tau_{cycle}$, for a single operating room. The problem states this is the sum of the average surgical time and the average turnover time.\n$$\n\\tau_{cycle} = \\tau_{s} + \\tau_{t}\n$$\nThis represents the total time a single operating room is occupied to process one patient from the start of surgery until the room is ready for the next patient.\n\nNext, we determine the total available service time across all operating rooms over the horizon $T$. With $c$ operating rooms, each available for a duration $T$, the total available OR-minutes, which we denote as $\\mathcal{T}_{total}$, is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{T}_{total} = c \\times T\n$$\n\nThe system's total capacity, $C$, measured in the number of cases it can process, is the total available service time divided by the service time required per case.\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\mathcal{T}_{total}}{\\tau_{cycle}} = \\frac{c T}{\\tau_{s} + \\tau_{t}}\n$$\n\nNow we can formulate the surge exceedance factor $S$ by substituting the expressions for demand and capacity.\n$$\nS = \\frac{N}{C} = \\frac{N}{\\frac{c T}{\\tau_{s} + \\tau_{t}}}\n$$\nThis can be written in its final closed form:\n$$\nS = \\frac{N (\\tau_{s} + \\tau_{t})}{c T}\n$$\nThis expression is dimensionless, as required. The numerator, $N (\\tau_{s} + \\tau_{t})$, has units of cases $\\times$ (minutes/case), resulting in units of minutes. The denominator, $c T$, has units of (dimensionless servers) $\\times$ minutes, also resulting in minutes. The ratio is therefore dimensionless.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $S$ by substituting the given parameters:\n- $N = 25$\n- $\\tau_{s} = 90$ minutes\n- $\\tau_{t} = 30$ minutes\n- $c = 2$\n- $T = 60$ minutes\n\nFirst, we calculate the mean cycle time:\n$$\n\\tau_{cycle} = 90 \\text{ min} + 30 \\text{ min} = 120 \\text{ min}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the capacity $C$:\n$$\nC = \\frac{2 \\times 60 \\text{ min}}{120 \\text{ min}} = \\frac{120}{120} = 1 \\text{ case-equivalent}\n$$\nThe system has the capacity to fully process $1$ case within the $60$-minute horizon.\n\nThe surge exceedance factor $S$ is then the ratio of the demand $N=25$ cases to the capacity $C=1$ case.\n$$\nS = \\frac{25}{1} = 25\n$$\nAlternatively, using the derived formula for $S$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{25 \\times (90 + 30)}{2 \\times 60} = \\frac{25 \\times 120}{120} = 25\n$$\nThe surge exceedance factor is $25$, indicating that the demand is $25$ times greater than the system's processing capacity over the specified horizon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{25}$$", "id": "5110818"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the initial impact, mass casualty management involves sustaining operations over time, where patient flow and processing bottlenecks become critical. Decontamination following a hazardous material release is a classic example of a potential chokepoint that must be properly resourced to prevent system collapse.

Assume negligible setup and turnover overhead between successive victims in a lane, no lane downtime, and negligible balking or reneging.\n\nStarting from first principles appropriate to mass casualty operations—specifically, conservation of flow in steady-state systems and the definition of service rate as the reciprocal of processing time—derive the minimum integer number of parallel decontamination lanes required so that the system is stable and does not accumulate a backlog under the stated conditions. The final answer must be a single integer (no units). No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimum number of parallel decontamination lanes to ensure system stability, defined as the condition where the system does not accumulate a backlog of victims. This is a problem of flow conservation in a steady-state system, which can be analyzed using fundamental principles of queuing theory.\n\nThe core principle for stability in such a system is that the total service rate must be greater than or equal to the arrival rate. If the total service rate is less than the arrival rate, the number of waiting victims will grow indefinitely, leading to an unstable system and an accumulating backlog. Let $\\lambda$ be the arrival rate of victims and $\\mu_{total}$ be the total service rate of the decontamination system. The condition for stability is:\n$$\n\\mu_{total} \\ge \\lambda\n$$\n\nFirst, we formalize the given parameters. The arrival rate is stated as approximately constant.\n$$\n\\lambda = 240 \\text{ victims/hour}\n$$\n\nThe service process is described by a deterministic, standardized decontamination cycle time, $T_s$, for each lane.\n$$\nT_s = 2 \\text{ minutes/victim}\n$$\n\nThe service rate of a single lane, $\\mu_{lane}$, is the reciprocal of the service time, $T_s$. The service rate represents the number of victims a single lane can process per unit of time.\n$$\n\\mu_{lane} = \\frac{1}{T_s}\n$$\n\nTo maintain dimensional consistency with the arrival rate $\\lambda$, which is given in victims per hour, we must convert the service time $T_s$ from minutes to hours. There are $60$ minutes in $1$ hour.\n$$\nT_s = 2 \\text{ minutes/victim} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ hour}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{2}{60} \\text{ hours/victim} = \\frac{1}{30} \\text{ hours/victim}\n$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the service rate of a single lane in victims per hour.\n$$\n\\mu_{lane} = \\frac{1}{T_s} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{30} \\text{ hours/victim}} = 30 \\text{ victims/hour}\n$$\nThus, each decontamination lane has the capacity to process $30$ victims per hour.\n\nThe system consists of $N$ identical, parallel decontamination lanes. Assuming the lanes operate independently, the total service rate of the system, $\\mu_{total}$, is the sum of the service rates of the individual lanes.\n$$\n\\mu_{total} = N \\times \\mu_{lane}\n$$\n\nWe now substitute this expression for the total service rate into the stability condition.\n$$\nN \\times \\mu_{lane} \\ge \\lambda\n$$\n\nTo find the minimum number of lanes, $N$, we can rearrange the inequality to solve for $N$.\n$$\nN \\ge \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu_{lane}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values for $\\lambda$ and $\\mu_{lane}$:\n$$\nN \\ge \\frac{240 \\text{ victims/hour}}{30 \\text{ victims/hour}}\n$$\n$$\nN \\ge 8\n$$\n\nThe result indicates that $N$ must be a number greater than or equal to $8$. Since the number of lanes must be an integer, the minimum integer value for $N$ that satisfies this condition is $8$. With $8$ lanes, the total service capacity is $8 \\times 30 = 240$ victims per hour, which exactly matches the arrival rate. In this deterministic, steady-state model, this capacity is sufficient to prevent the accumulation of a backlog. If there were fewer than $8$ lanes, the arrival rate would exceed the service capacity, and a queue would grow continuously. Therefore, the minimum integer number of lanes required is $8$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "5110870"}, {"introduction": "Effective disaster response is an iterative process of acting and learning, with a cornerstone being the retrospective evaluation of key decisions like triage.
