The lower and upper bounds of this interval, denoted $T_{min}$ and $T_{max}$ respectively, are:\n$$T_{min} = T_{nom} - 5\\% = 30\\% - 5\\% = 25\\%$$\n$$T_{max} = T_{nom} + 5\\% = 30\\% + 5\\% = 35\\%$$\nThus, the possible range for the TBSA is $T \\in [25, 35]$.\n\nThe volume $V$ is a monotonically increasing linear function of the TBSA percentage $T$, given that $k$ and $W$ are positive constants. Consequently, the minimum required fluid volume, $V_{min}$, will correspond to the minimum TBSA, $T_{min}$, and the maximum required fluid volume, $V_{max}$, will correspond to the maximum TBSA, $T_{max}$.\n\nWe calculate the lower bound of the fluid volume range:\n$$V_{min} = k \\cdot W \\cdot T_{min}$$\n$$V_{min} = \\left(4 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\%}\\right) \\cdot (70 \\text{ kg}) \\cdot (25\\%) = 7000 \\text{ mL}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the upper bound of the fluid volume range:\n$$V_{max} = k \\cdot W \\cdot T_{max}$$\n$$V_{max} = \\left(4 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\%}\\right) \\cdot (70 \\text{ kg}) \\cdot (35\\%) = 9800 \\text{ mL}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final bounds to be expressed in liters (L) and rounded to three significant figures.
