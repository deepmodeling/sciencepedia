The guiding principle for this calculation is explicitly provided in the problem statement: only partial-thickness and full-thickness burns are included, as these are the injuries that lead to significant capillary leakage and intravascular volume depletion. Superficial (first-degree) burns, characterized by erythema without blistering, do not cause a hemodynamically significant fluid shift and are therefore excluded from such calculations.\n\nLet $A_{\\text{total}}$ represent the total body surface area of the patient, which corresponds to $100\\%$.

The baseline infusion rate, set at $t=0$, corresponds to the rate for the first hour, $R_0$.\n\nThe patient's target Urine Output (UOP) is given as $35$ $\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{hr}^{-1}$. The recorded UOP is consistently $20$ $\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{hr}^{-1}$ for the first $3$ hours. Since $20$ $\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{hr}^{-1}$ is less than $35$ $\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{hr}^{-1}$, the condition for increasing the infusion rate is met at the end of each of the first three hours.\n\nThe titration rule states that the infusion rate for the subsequent hour is increased by $0.20$ of its current value. Mathematically, if the rate during hour $n$ is $R_{n-1}$, the rate for the subsequent hour, $R_n$, is given by:\n$$R_n = R_{n-1} + 0.20 \\times R_{n-1} = (1 + 0.20) R_{n-1} = 1.20 R_{n-1}$$\nThis rule is applied at $t=1$, $t=2$, and $t=3$.\n\nWe can now calculate the infusion rate for each hour sequentially.\n\n**1. At the start of Hour 1 (t=0):**\nThe infusion rate during the first hour (interval $[0, 1)$) is the baseline rate, $R_0$.\nOver this hour, the UOP is $20$ $\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{hr}^{-1}$, which is below the target. Therefore, at the end of this hour ($t=1$), the rate must be increased for the next hour.\n\n**2. At the start of Hour 2 (t=1):**\nThe new rate, $R_1$, for the interval $[1, 2)$ is calculated based on $R_0$:\n$$R_1 = 1.20 \\times R_0$$\nOver this second hour, the UOP is again $20$ $\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{hr}^{-1}$, which is below target. At the end of this hour ($t=2$), the rate is increased again.\n\n**3. At the start of Hour 3 (t=2):**\nThe new rate, $R_2$, for the interval $[2, 3)$ is calculated based on $R_1$:\n$$R_2 = 1.20 \\times R_1 = 1.20 \\times (1.20 \\times R_0) = (1.20)^2 R_0$$\nOver this third hour, the UOP remains at $20$ $\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{hr}^{-1}$, still below target.

At the start of Hour 4 (t=3):**\nThe new rate, $R_3$, for the interval starting at $t=3$ is calculated based on $R_2$:\n$$R_3 = 1.20 \\times R_2 = 1.20 \\times ((1.20)^2 R_0) = (1.20)^3 R_0$$\nThis rate $R_3$ is the infusion rate that begins at the start of the fourth hour.\n\nThe problem asks for the cumulative multiplicative adjustment factor to apply to the baseline rate $R_0$ at the start of hour $4$. This factor is the ratio $R_3/R_0$.\nFrom the equation for $R_3$, we can find this ratio:\n$$\\frac{R_3}{R_0} = (1.20)^3$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of this factor:\n$$(1.20)^3 = 1.20 \\times 1.20 \\times 1.20 = 1.44 \\times 1.20 = 1.728$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
