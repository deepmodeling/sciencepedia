Intraoperatively, the surgeon measures the closest radial margin in vivo along a straight line orthogonal to the tumor boundary.

It uses standard definitions from continuum mechanics (isotropic scaling, Cauchy strain) to model a real-world biophysical phenomenon (tissue shrinkage post-resection). The model is a simplification but is physically and mathematically consistent. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and values to calculate a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The data are consistent: the definition $\\epsilon = \\frac{L - L^{\\prime}}{L}$ combined with $L^{\\prime} = kL$ yields $\\epsilon = \\frac{L - kL}{L} = 1 - k$, which is explicitly stated. The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Proceed to Solution**\nLet $M_{vivo}$ be the length of the surgical margin as measured in vivo (before shrinkage) and $M_{exvivo}$ be the length of the same margin as measured ex vivo (after shrinkage). A margin is a length, so it is subject to the same shrinkage model as any other length, $L$.\n\nThe problem states that shrinkage is a uniform, isotropic linear scaling. The relationship between any in vivo length, $L_{vivo}$, and its corresponding ex vivo length, $L_{exvivo}$, is given by:\n$$L_{exvivo} = k \\cdot L_{vivo}$$\nwhere $k$ is the scaling factor.\n\nThe problem provides the engineering linear strain, $\\epsilon$, associated with the shrinkage:\n$$\\epsilon = 0.20$$\n\nThe scaling factor $k$ is related to the strain $\\epsilon$ by the given formula:\n$$k = 1 - \\epsilon$$\nSubstituting the value of $\\epsilon$:\n$$k = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$$\n\nThis scaling factor applies to all lengths, including the surgical margin. Therefore, the relationship between the in vivo margin and the ex vivo margin is:\n$$M_{exvivo} = k \\cdot M_{vivo} = 0.80 \\cdot M_{vivo}$$\n\nThe clinical requirement is that the minimal ex vivo pathologic margin must be at least $10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This can be expressed as an inequality:\n$$M_{exvivo} \\ge 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nTo ensure this condition is met, we must determine the minimum required in vivo margin. We substitute the expression for $M_{exvivo}$ into the inequality:\n$$0.80 \\cdot M_{vivo} \\ge 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nTo find the minimum value of $M_{vivo}$ that satisfies this condition, we solve the corresponding equality:\n$$0.80 \\cdot M_{vivo} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nSolving for $M_{vivo}$:\n$$M_{vivo} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{0.80}$$\n$$M_{vivo} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{4/5} = 10 \\cdot \\frac{5}{4}\\,\\mathrm{mm} = \\frac{50}{4}\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$M_{vivo} = 12.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThis result is the minimum in vivo margin that must be achieved intraoperatively. Any in vivo margin less than $12.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ would result in an ex vivo margin smaller than the required $10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. For example, an in vivo margin of $12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ would yield an ex vivo margin of $0.80 \\cdot 12\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 9.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, which is insufficient.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

This is a standard application of conditional probability and Bayes' theorem. The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded in established biostatistical principles, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nFirst, we must formally define the events based on the problem statement:\n- Let $M^+$ be the event that the surgical margin is truly positive (i.e., contains tumor cells).\n- Let $M^-$ be the event that the surgical margin is truly negative (i.e., is free of tumor cells).\n- Let $T^+$ be the event that the frozen section test result is positive.\n- Let $T^-$ be the event that the frozen section test result is negative.\n\nThe givens can be expressed in terms of conditional probabilities:\n- The sensitivity ($S_e$) is the probability of a positive test given the condition is present: $S_e = P(T^+|M^+) = 0.85$.\n- The specificity ($S_p$) is the probability of a negative test given the condition is absent: $S_p = P(T^-|M^-) = 0.95$.\n- The pretest probability, or prevalence, of a positive margin is $P(M^+) = 0.30$.\n\nFrom these primary probabilities, we can deduce several complementary probabilities that are necessary for the calculation:\n- The probability of a truly negative margin is $P(M^-) = 1 - P(M^+) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\n- The probability of a false positive result (a positive test when the margin is truly negative), which is a Type I error, is $P(T^+|M^-) = 1 - S_p = 1 - P(T^-|M^-) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n- The probability of a false negative result (a negative test when the margin is truly positive), which is a Type II error, is $P(T^-|M^+) = 1 - S_e = 1 - P(T^+|M^+) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) is the post-test probability that the margin is truly positive, given that the test result is positive.

This can be calculated using the law of total probability, which sums the probabilities of all ways a positive test can occur (a true positive or a false positive):\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|M^+)P(M^+) + P(T^+|M^-)P(M^-)$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.85)(0.30) + (0.05)(0.70) = 0.255 + 0.035 = 0.290$$\nNow, we can compute the $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.255}{0.290} \\approx 0.87931034...$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, $PPV = 0.8793$.\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$) is the post-test probability that the margin is truly negative, given that the test result is negative.
