Each trial corresponds to the pathologic examination of a single lymph node.\n\nLet $E_i$ be the event that the $i$-th lymph node examined is positive for tumor involvement.\nThe problem provides the probability of this event for any node:\n$P(E_i) = p = 0.20$.\n\nThe event that the $i$-th lymph node is negative is the complement of $E_i$, denoted $E_i^c$.
