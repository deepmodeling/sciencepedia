Extraction of Givens**\n- Patient: 72-year-old man.\n- Presentation: Progressive abdominal distension, obstipation, minimal vomiting for 36 hours.\n- History: Intermittent left lower quadrant cramping for several weeks, unintentional weight loss.\n- Examination: Afebrile, heart rate 98 beats per minute, blood pressure 132/78 mmHg. Abdomen markedly distended, tympanitic, mild diffuse tenderness, no peritoneal signs.\n- Laboratory: White blood cell count $11.8 \\times 10^9/\\text{L}$, lactate $1.7 \\text{ mmol/L}$.\n- Radiograph Findings: Marked colonic distension, largest loop in the right lower quadrant, non-dilated small bowel, suggesting a competent ileocecal valve and a closed-loop large bowel obstruction.\n- Calibration Sphere True Diameter: $s_t = 3.0 \\text{ cm}$.\n- Calibration Sphere Apparent Diameter (measured on radiograph): $s_m = 3.3 \\text{ cm}$.\n- Cecum Apparent Diameter (measured on radiograph): $d_m = 14.0 \\text{ cm}$.\n- Constraints: Computed tomography (CT) unavailable for 6 hours. No evidence of sigmoid volvulus.\n- Assumption: Apparent diameters on the radiograph are related to true diameters by a constant magnification factor $M$, defined as $M = s_m / s_t$.\n\n**1.2. Validation and Verdict**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in established principles of surgery and radiology. The clinical presentation is a classic scenario for a distal large bowel obstruction, likely due to a malignancy given the history of chronic symptoms and weight loss. The concept of a closed-loop obstruction with a competent ileocecal valve leading to cecal distension is a fundamental pathophysiological mechanism. The Law of Laplace provides the physical basis for why the cecum, having the largest radius, is at the highest risk of perforation. The use of a calibration marker to correct for radiographic magnification is a valid and standard technique. The clinical thresholds for cecal diameter (>12 cm indicating high risk) are widely accepted in surgical practice.\n- **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The problem provides all necessary information to perform the required calculation and make a clinical judgment. The quantitative data ($s_t$, $s_m$, $d_m$) are provided, and the method for calculating the magnification factor is explicitly stated. The clinical context is sufficient to evaluate the management options.\n- **Objectivity and Realism**: The problem is stated in objective clinical terms and represents a highly realistic and common surgical emergency. The unavailability of immediate CT imaging is a frequent real-world constraint that forces clinicians to rely on other diagnostic data, such as plain radiographs.\n\n**Verdict**: The problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and clinically relevant. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Solution\n\n**2.1. Principle-Based Derivation**\nThe core of the problem is to determine the true diameter of the cecum to assess the risk of perforation. Radiographs produce magnified images. The degree of magnification can be determined by comparing the measured size of an object of known size (the calibration sphere) on the film to its true size.\n\nThe magnification factor, $M$, is given by the ratio of the apparent (measured) size to the true size of the calibration sphere.\n$$ M = \\frac{s_m}{s_t} $$\nGiven values are $s_m = 3.3 \\text{ cm}$ and $s_t = 3.0 \\text{ cm}$.\n$$ M = \\frac{3.3 \\text{ cm}}{3.0 \\text{ cm}} = 1.1 $$\nThis means the radiographic image is magnified by a factor of 1.1, or 10%.\n\nAssuming this magnification factor is constant across the field of view for structures at a similar depth, we can use it to find the true cecal diameter, $d_t$, from its apparent measured diameter, $d_m$.\n$$ d_m = M \\times d_t $$\nTherefore, the true cecal diameter is:\n$$ d_t = \\frac{d_m}{M} $$\nGiven $d_m = 14.0 \\text{ cm}$ and $M = 1.1$:\n$$ d_t = \\frac{14.0 \\text{ cm}}{1.1} \\approx 12.727 \\text{ cm} $$\nThe corrected, true cecal diameter is approximately $12.7 \\text{ cm}$.\n\nThe established clinical threshold for a high risk of cecal perforation in a closed-loop large bowel obstruction is a diameter greater than 12 cm. Since $12.7 \\text{ cm} > 12 \\text{ cm}$, the patient's cecum is distended beyond the high-risk threshold.\n\n**2.2. Clinical Integration**\nThe patient presents with a complete mechanical large bowel obstruction, which is a surgical emergency. The obstruction is a closed-loop type due to the competent ileocecal valve, leading to progressive and isolated colonic distension. This dramatically increases the intraluminal pressure in the colon. According to the Law of Laplace, wall tension is proportional to the radius ($T \\propto P \\cdot r$). Since the cecum has the largest diameter in the colon, it experiences the greatest wall tension and is the most common site of perforation (a so-called \"diastatic\" perforation).\n\nThe calculated true cecal diameter of $\\approx 12.7 \\text{ cm}$ confirms that the patient is at high risk for impending perforation. While the patient is currently hemodynamically stable and without peritoneal signs, the situation can deteriorate rapidly. Waiting 6 hours for a CT scan is not advisable as perforation could occur in the interim, significantly increasing morbidity and mortality. The appropriate management is emergent surgical decompression to relieve the obstruction and prevent perforation. Pre-operative measures include fluid resuscitation and administration of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics to cover translocation of gut flora. Bowel preparation is absolutely contraindicated in a complete mechanical obstruction.\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The corrected cecal diameter exceeds the high-risk threshold for perforation in a closed-loop large bowel obstruction; proceed emergently to operative decompression (e.g., exploratory laparotomy with proximal diversion or subtotal colectomy) rather than waiting for imaging; administer intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and avoid bowel preparation.**\n- **Analysis**: This option correctly identifies that the calculated cecal diameter ($\\approx 12.7 \\text{ cm}$) exceeds the high-risk threshold (12 cm). It correctly concludes that this constitutes a surgical emergency requiring immediate operative decompression, bypassing the 6-hour wait for CT. The ancillary measures—IV antibiotics and avoidance of bowel prep—are also standard of care in this situation.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The corrected cecal diameter is below the high-risk threshold; continue resuscitation and defer intervention until computed tomography (CT) is available; consider endoscopic stenting later; no immediate decompression is required.**\n- **Analysis**: This option's premise is factually incorrect. The corrected cecal diameter is $\\approx 12.7 \\text{ cm}$, which is *above*, not below, the high-risk threshold. Therefore, the recommended management (deferring intervention) is dangerously inappropriate.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The corrected diameter exceeds the threshold, but the first-line therapy is pharmacologic parasympathomimetic neostigmine as used in Acute Colonic Pseudo-Obstruction (ACPO); avoid surgery in favor of medical therapy.**\n- **Analysis**: This option correctly notes that the diameter exceeds the threshold but proposes a dangerously incorrect therapy. Neostigmine is used for ACPO (Ogilvie's syndrome), a functional adynamic ileus of the colon. The patient's history (LLQ cramping, weight loss) and presentation strongly suggest a mechanical obstruction (e.g., a sigmoid tumor), not a pseudo-obstruction. Administering a pro-motility agent like neostigmine in the face of a distal mechanical blockage would increase proximal pressure and likely precipitate perforation.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Place a nasogastric tube (NGT) to decompress the colon, which will reliably reduce cecal diameter and allow safe delay; antibiotics are not indicated without fever.**\n- **Analysis**: This option contains two major errors. First, a nasogastric tube decompresses the stomach and, to some extent, the small bowel. It cannot decompress the colon, especially when the ileocecal valve is competent, as stated in the problem. The gas in the colon is trapped. Second, antibiotics are indicated in cases of impending bowel perforation due to the high risk of bacterial translocation, even in the absence of fever. The patient's mild leukocytosis further supports this decision.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Urgently perform colonoscopic decompression with rectal tube because sigmoid volvulus is suspected; surgery is unnecessary at this stage.**\n- **Analysis**: The problem statement explicitly rules out sigmoid volvulus (\"no clinical or radiographic evidence of sigmoid volvulus\"). Therefore, the rationale for this intervention is invalid. While colonoscopy can be used to place a stent across a malignant obstruction as a bridge to surgery or for palliation, it is generally not the emergent procedure of choice for impending cecal perforation, and the justification provided here is wrong. Emergency surgery is the standard of care for impending perforation.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5142586"}, {"introduction": "Once the need for intervention is established, aggressive fluid resuscitation is the cornerstone of stabilizing a patient with large bowel obstruction, who often presents with significant volume depletion.

There are no contradictions, unrealistic conditions, or other flaws. The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We will proceed with a full solution.\n\nLet's define the events:\n- $L$: The patient has an anastomotic leak.\n- $L^c$: The patient does not have an anastomotic leak.\n- $D$: The DLS is positive (DLS $\\geq 7$).\n- $R$: The patient undergoes reoperation.\n- $I$: The patient has a diverting ileostomy.\n- $I^c$: The patient does not have a diverting ileostomy.\n\nThe problem asks for two calculations:\n1. The posterior probability of an anastomotic leak given a positive DLS, $P(L|D)$.\n2. The absolute reduction in expected reoperation risk attributable to having an ileostomy, conditioned on the positive DLS finding. This is the Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$).\n\n**Part 1: Posterior Probability of Anastomotic Leak, $P(L|D)$**\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have the following probabilities:\n- The pretest probability (prevalence) of a leak: $P(L) = 0.12$.\n- The probability of not having a leak is the complement: $P(L^c) = 1 - P(L) = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88$.\n- The sensitivity of the test: $P(D|L) = 0.74$.\n- The specificity of the test: $P(D^c|L^c) = 0.68$.\n\nFrom the specificity, we can calculate the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given no leak:\n$$P(D|L^c) = 1 - P(D^c|L^c) = 1 - 0.68 = 0.32$$\n\nTo find the posterior probability $P(L|D)$, we use Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(L|D) = \\frac{P(D|L) P(L)}{P(D)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(D)$, is the total probability of a positive test. We calculate it using the law of total probability:\n$$P(D) = P(D|L) P(L) + P(D|L^c) P(L^c)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(D) = (0.74)(0.12) + (0.32)(0.88) = 0.0888 + 0.2816 = 0.3704$$\n\nNow we can calculate the posterior probability of a leak:\n$$P(L|D) = \\frac{0.0888}{0.3704} \\approx 0.23974082$$\n\nWe will also need the posterior probability of *no* leak given a positive test, $P(L^c|D)$:\n$$P(L^c|D) = 1 - P(L|D) = 1 - \\frac{0.0888}{0.3704} = \\frac{0.3704 - 0.0888}{0.3704} = \\frac{0.2816}{0.3704} \\approx 0.76025918$$\n\n**Part 2: Absolute Reduction in Expected Reoperation Risk**\n\nThe absolute risk reduction ($ARR$) is the difference between the probability of reoperation without a diverting ileostomy and the probability of reoperation with one, both conditioned on the positive DLS finding.\n$$ARR = P(R|I^c, D) - P(R|I, D)$$\n\nWe calculate each term using the law of total probability, conditioning on the leak status ($L$ or $L^c$). The problem states that the ileostomy does not change the intrinsic leak probability, so $P(L|I, D) = P(L|I^c, D) = P(L|D)$.\n\nFirst, for the case with no diverting ileostomy ($I^c$):\n$$P(R|I^c, D) = P(R|L, I^c, D)P(L|D) + P(R|L^c, I^c, D)P(L^c|D)$$\nThe reoperation is a downstream consequence of the leak status. The DLS score is a diagnostic marker for the leak. Therefore, once the true leak status is known (conditioned upon), the DLS score provides no further information about the risk of reoperation. This implies conditional independence: $R \\perp D | (L, I^c)$ and $R \\perp D | (L^c, I^c)$.\nSo, $P(R|L, I^c, D) = P(R|L, I^c)$ and $P(R|L^c, I^c, D) = P(R|L^c, I^c)$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- $P(R|L, I^c) = 0.60$\n- $P(R|L^c) = 0.02$, which applies to both $I^c$ and $I$, so $P(R|L^c, I^c) = 0.02$.\n\nThus, the probability of reoperation without an ileostomy is:\n$$P(R|I^c, D) = (0.60)P(L|D) + (0.02)P(L^c|D)$$\n\nNext, for the case with a diverting ileostomy ($I$):\n$$P(R|I, D) = P(R|L, I, D)P(L|D) + P(R|L^c, I, D)P(L^c|D)$$\nUsing the same conditional independence argument, we have:\n- $P(R|L, I) = 0.25$\n- $P(R|L^c, I) = 0.02$\n\nThus, the probability of reoperation with an ileostomy is:\n$$P(R|I, D) = (0.25)P(L|D) + (0.02)P(L^c|D)$$\n\nNow we compute the $ARR$:\n$$ARR = P(R|I^c, D) - P(R|I, D)$$\n$$ARR = \\left[ (0.60)P(L|D) + (0.02)P(L^c|D) \\right] - \\left[ (0.25)P(L|D) + (0.02)P(L^c|D) \\right]$$\nThe terms involving $P(L^c|D)$ cancel out:\n$$ARR = (0.60 - 0.25)P(L|D) = (0.35)P(L|D)$$\n\nSubstituting the value of $P(L|D)$ we calculated in Part 1:\n$$ARR = 0.35 \\times \\frac{0.0888}{0.3704}$$\n$$ARR \\approx 0.35 \\times 0.23974082 \\approx 0.083909287$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe value is approximately 0.083909.
