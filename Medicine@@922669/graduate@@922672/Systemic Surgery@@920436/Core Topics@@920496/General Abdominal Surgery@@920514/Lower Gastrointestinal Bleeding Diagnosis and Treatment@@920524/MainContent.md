## Introduction
Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is a common and potentially life-threatening clinical emergency that confronts surgeons, gastroenterologists, and emergency physicians. Effective management extends beyond a rigid algorithm, demanding a sophisticated integration of anatomical knowledge, pathophysiological insight, and a nuanced understanding of advanced diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. The critical challenge lies in accurately localizing the bleeding source and applying the correct intervention in a timely manner, often in hemodynamically unstable patients with complex comorbidities. This article provides a comprehensive framework for mastering the diagnosis and treatment of LGIB.

The following chapters will guide you from foundational knowledge to expert application. In **Principles and Mechanisms**, we will establish the fundamental definitions of LGIB, explore the detailed pathophysiology of its most common causes, and analyze the physical principles that govern our primary diagnostic tools. Next, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** will bridge theory and practice, illustrating how these core principles are applied in real-world scenarios, from initial resuscitation and risk stratification to managing LGIB in special populations requiring collaboration with cardiology, nephrology, and other specialties. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will provide opportunities to apply quantitative reasoning to clinical problems, reinforcing your ability to make evidence-based decisions in high-stakes situations.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### Defining Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Anatomy and Clinical Presentation

The fundamental distinction between upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is an anatomical one, anchored by the **ligament of Treitz**. This suspensory ligament marks the duodenojejunal flexure. Hemorrhage originating proximal to this ligament—in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum—is classified as **upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB)**. Conversely, hemorrhage originating distal to the ligament of Treitz—in the jejunum, ileum, colon, rectum, or anus—is defined as **lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB)**. While this anatomical boundary is precise, the clinical presentation can be variable, reflecting the complex interplay between the bleeding source, the rate of hemorrhage, and the physiology of intestinal transit [@problem_id:5144668].

The appearance of stool is a critical, albeit imperfect, diagnostic clue. This coloration is determined by the extent to which hemoglobin is chemically altered by gastric acid, [digestive enzymes](@entry_id:163700), and intestinal flora. This process is time-dependent.

**Melena** refers to the passage of black, tarry, and foul-smelling stools. This appearance results from the oxidation of heme iron and the conversion of hemoglobin to pigments such as acid hematin. This transformation requires sufficient exposure time to the digestive environment. Consequently, melena is the classic presentation of UGIB, as blood has the entire length of the small and large bowel to transit. A relatively small volume of blood, on the order of $50$–$100$ $\mathrm{mL}$, can produce melena if the transit is slow enough. It is important to recognize, however, that melena can occasionally arise from a slow-bleed source in the proximal small bowel or even the right colon, particularly in patients with prolonged intestinal transit times [@problem_id:5144668].

**Hematochezia**, the passage of bright red or maroon-colored blood per rectum, signifies blood that has undergone little to no digestion. Bright red blood is characteristic of a distal source, such as the sigmoid colon, rectum, or anus, where transit time to evacuation is short. Maroon-colored stool suggests a more proximal source within the colon (e.g., transverse or right colon) or distal small bowel, allowing for some, but not complete, degradation of blood. Critically, hematochezia does not definitively rule out an upper GI source. A massive UGIB, such as from a large peptic ulcer or esophageal varices, can overwhelm the digestive process and lead to such rapid intestinal transit that blood presents as hematochezia. This scenario is a clinical emergency, often associated with profound hemodynamic instability [@problem_id:5144668].

### Etiologies of Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding: An Epidemiological Overview

While numerous conditions can cause LGIB, the distribution of etiologies encountered in clinical practice depends heavily on the patient population and the severity of bleeding. The causes of minor rectal spotting seen in an outpatient clinic differ significantly from the causes of severe, hemodynamically significant hemorrhage requiring hospital admission. For hospitalized adult patients presenting with major LGIB, the epidemiological landscape is dominated by a few key pathologies.

A representative distribution of etiologies for a large cohort of hospitalized adults with significant LGIB would be as follows [@problem_id:5144722]:

*   **Diverticular Hemorrhage**: This is the most common cause, accounting for approximately $20\%$ to $40\%$ of cases.
*   **Angiodysplasia (Arteriovenous Malformations)**: This is another major cause, particularly in older adults, responsible for roughly $10\%$ to $30\%$ of episodes.
*   **Ischemic Colitis**: A significant etiology, especially in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, accounting for $5\%$ to $15\%$ of cases.
*   **Upper GI Source**: A brisk UGIB presenting as hematochezia is a critical mimic of LGIB and is identified as the true source in $5\%$ to $15\%$ of patients admitted for suspected LGIB.
*   **Colorectal Neoplasia**: Cancers and large polyps can cause acute bleeding, accounting for about $5\%$ to $11\%$ of admissions.
*   **Anorectal Causes**: While hemorrhoids and anal fissures are the most common overall cause of rectal bleeding, they are a less frequent cause of hemorrhage severe enough to require hospitalization, typically accounting for $4\%$ to $10\%$ of such cases.
*   **Other Causes**: A smaller percentage of cases are due to [inflammatory bowel disease](@entry_id:194390) (IBD), post-polypectomy bleeding, and chronic radiation proctitis.
*   **Obscure Bleeding**: In approximately $5\%$ to $15\%$ of cases, a definitive source is not identified despite a thorough workup.

### Pathophysiological Mechanisms of Major Bleeding Etiologies

Understanding why these specific conditions bleed requires an appreciation of their unique pathophysiological mechanisms, from gross anatomy to molecular biology.

#### Diverticular Hemorrhage

Colonic diverticula are not true diverticula; they are **pseudodiverticula**, consisting of mucosa and submucosa that have herniated through the muscularis propria. This herniation occurs at points of structural weakness in the colonic wall, specifically where the penetrating nutrient arteries, the **[vasa recta](@entry_id:151308)**, pierce the muscle layer to supply the mucosa. As the artery penetrates this defect, it becomes draped over the dome of the diverticulum, separated from the colonic lumen only by a thin layer of mucosa and submucosa. This anatomical arrangement predisposes the vessel to injury from decades of mechanical stress, leading to focal thinning of the arterial wall and eventual rupture into the colonic lumen [@problem_id:5144648].

This unique anatomy has profound implications for endoscopic therapy. Attempting to apply thermal energy or inject substances into the diverticular dome is extremely hazardous. The wall of the dome is exquisitely thin, lacking the structural support of a muscle layer. According to the law of Laplace, wall tension ($T$) is proportional to the product of intraluminal pressure ($P$) and radius ($r$), expressed as $T \propto P \times r$. Injecting fluid into the dome or causing it to distend drastically increases wall tension, creating a high risk of iatrogenic perforation. The safest and most effective endoscopic strategy for a visible vessel in a diverticulum is mechanical therapy, such as placing endoscopic clips across the neck of the diverticulum. This compresses the [vasa recta](@entry_id:151308) at its entry point against the firmer tissue of the muscularis propria, achieving durable hemostasis without stressing the fragile dome [@problem_id:5144648].

#### Angiodysplasia and Heyde's Syndrome

Colonic **angiodysplasia** consists of acquired, degenerative vascular ectasias most commonly found in the [cecum](@entry_id:172840) and right colon of older adults. Histologically, these are dilated, thin-walled, endothelial-lined channels in the mucosa and submucosa. These fragile vessels are prone to bleeding, a risk that is dramatically amplified by a specific systemic condition in what is known as **Heyde's syndrome**: the combination of aortic stenosis and gastrointestinal bleeding from angiodysplasia [@problem_id:5144654].

The link is a fascinating example of pathological fluid dynamics affecting hemostasis. A stenotic aortic valve has a narrowed cross-sectional area ($A$). To maintain cardiac output (volumetric flow rate, $Q$), the velocity ($v$) of blood jetting through the orifice must increase dramatically, per the conservation of flow equation $Q = vA$. This high velocity creates a zone of extreme shear stress ($\tau$). This shear stress physically unfolds the largest multimers of **von Willebrand factor (vWF)**, a crucial protein for primary hemostasis. The unfolded high-molecular-weight (HMW) vWF multimers are then susceptible to cleavage by the metalloproteinase **ADAMTS13**. In a patient with aortic stenosis, the constant passage of blood through the high-shear jet leads to accelerated proteolysis and a selective depletion of HMW vWF multimers, resulting in an acquired Type 2A von Willebrand syndrome. These HMW multimers are essential for platelet adhesion in high-shear environments, such as those found within the angiodysplastic lesions themselves. The resulting coagulopathy leads to recurrent, difficult-to-control bleeding. This explains why local endoscopic therapy is often only transiently effective, whereas correcting the underlying cardiac lesion by aortic valve replacement can permanently resolve the bleeding by eliminating the source of pathological shear stress [@problem_id:5144654].

#### Ischemic Colitis

Ischemic colitis is a hypoperfusion injury to the colon, most often occurring in the absence of a major vessel occlusion (i.e., non-occlusive). It is typically precipitated by a systemic low-flow state, such as hypotension from sepsis, heart failure, or severe volume depletion [@problem_id:5144659]. The colon's blood supply has regions of tenuous collateralization known as **watershed zones**. According to the fundamental hemodynamic equation $Q = \Delta P / R$, blood flow ($Q$) is directly proportional to the perfusion pressure gradient ($\Delta P$) and inversely proportional to vascular resistance ($R$). Watershed zones have physiologically higher resistance ($R$) due to limited collateral connections. When systemic perfusion pressure ($\Delta P$) drops, these are the areas most vulnerable to ischemia. The two principal watershed zones are:

1.  **The Splenic Flexure (Griffith's Point):** The junction between the territories of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA).
2.  **The Rectosigmoid Junction (Sudeck's Point):** The junction between the territories of the IMA and the internal iliac arteries.

The clinical presentation is characteristic: sudden onset of crampy abdominal pain, followed within hours by an urgency to defecate and the passage of hematochezia. The bleeding results from mucosal sloughing and capillary damage in the ischemic segment. Diagnostic imaging and colonoscopy reveal a sharply demarcated, segmental pattern of injury, with findings of pallor, edema ("thumbprinting" on CT), and ulceration, classically involving the splenic flexure and sparing the well-collateralized rectum [@problem_id:5144659].

#### Neoplastic Bleeding

Colorectal cancers and large adenomatous polyps bleed due to the chaotic and fragile nature of their blood supply. As a tumor grows, it outstrips its existing vasculature, creating a hypoxic microenvironment. This hypoxia stabilizes the transcription factor **hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)**, which in turn drives the massive upregulation of pro-angiogenic factors, chief among them being **vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)** [@problem_id:5144680].

This VEGF-driven angiogenesis is disorganized, producing a dense network of structurally abnormal neovessels. These vessels are tortuous, poorly supported by [pericytes](@entry_id:198446) (as shown by reduced alpha-smooth muscle actin staining), and have defective, leaky basement membranes. This architecture leads to the formation of arteriovenous shunts, which bypass capillary beds and subject the fragile vessels to high arterial pressures. The mechanical fragility can be understood by the Law of Laplace ($\sigma \propto (P \cdot r) / w$): high intraluminal pressure ($P$) and dilated radii ($r$) combined with thin, poorly supported walls ($w$) lead to extremely high wall stress ($\sigma$). These vessels are therefore prone to rupture from the minor mechanical trauma and shear forces exerted by the passing fecal stream, leading to chronic or acute bleeding. Definitive control of bleeding from a neoplasm thus requires either removal of the lesion (resection) or reduction of the high inflow pressure via selective arterial embolization [@problem_id:5144680].

#### Chronic Radiation Proctitis

Radiation injury to the rectum is biphasic. Acute proctitis occurs during or within 3 months of [radiotherapy](@entry_id:150080), driven by damage to rapidly dividing mucosal cells. **Chronic radiation proctitis (CRP)**, however, manifests months to years later and has a different pathophysiology [@problem_id:5144647]. The primary target of late radiation injury is the vasculature. Radiation causes a progressive **obliterative endarteritis** of small submucosal arterioles. This vessel occlusion leads to chronic tissue ischemia and fibrosis. In a compensatory but aberrant response to this hypoxia, new, fragile blood vessels—**telangiectasias**—form in the submucosa. These thin-walled, dilated vessels lie just beneath an atrophic, friable rectal mucosa. Minor trauma from the passage of stool is sufficient to cause them to rupture, leading to the characteristic presentation of painless, intermittent hematochezia. The first-line therapy is endoscopic [ablation](@entry_id:153309) of these superficial vessels, for which a non-contact modality like **Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC)** is ideal due to its ability to achieve superficial coagulation without deep thermal injury [@problem_id:5144647].

### Principles of Diagnostic Localization

A major challenge in managing LGIB is that the bleeding is often intermittent, making localization difficult. The choice of diagnostic modality is guided by the patient's hemodynamic stability and the suspected rate of bleeding. Each test is based on a distinct physical principle and has a characteristic **detection threshold**, defined as the minimal bleeding rate required for visualization.

#### Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA)

CTA is a rapid, [non-invasive imaging](@entry_id:166153) technique that has become a first-line diagnostic tool for acute LGIB. It involves the intravenous injection of iodinated contrast followed by rapid acquisition of images during the arterial phase. Active bleeding is identified by the presence of high-density contrast material extravasating into the bowel lumen.

The detection threshold for modern multi-detector CTA is approximately **$0.3$–$0.5$ $\mathrm{mL/min}$** [@problem_id:5144682]. In a patient with active, brisk hemorrhage and hemodynamic instability, CTA is the ideal initial test. For example, a patient passing $25$ $\mathrm{mL}$ of blood every $8$ minutes has an average bleeding rate of approximately $3.1$ $\mathrm{mL/min}$, well above the CTA detection threshold. The speed of CTA allows for rapid localization to guide subsequent therapy, such as transcatheter embolization, without the need for bowel preparation. If a CTA is positive, it provides a "roadmap" for the interventional radiologist. A negative CTA, however, only indicates that the bleeding rate was below the detection threshold *at the moment of the scan*; it does not rule out a source that is bleeding intermittently [@problem_id:5144682].

#### Tagged Red Blood Cell (RBC) Scintigraphy

This [nuclear medicine](@entry_id:138217) study is the most sensitive test for detecting active GI bleeding. The patient's own red blood cells are drawn, labeled with a radioactive tracer (Technetium-99m, ${}^{99\mathrm{m}}\text{Tc}$), and re-injected. The patient is then imaged over a prolonged period (up to 90 minutes or longer) with a gamma camera. The principle is one of signal accumulation: even a very slow bleed will, over time, cause a detectable accumulation of radioactivity outside the normal vascular structures.

Based on Poisson counting statistics, this modality can reliably detect bleeding rates as low as **$0.1$ $\mathrm{mL/min}$** [@problem_id:5144701]. This high sensitivity is its primary strength, making it useful for identifying intermittent, low-grade bleeding when other tests are negative. However, its major limitation is poor spatial resolution. The planar 2D images can localize bleeding only to a general quadrant of the abdomen. Furthermore, the movement of extravasated blood via [peristalsis](@entry_id:140959) can be misleading, with the apparent site of activity on later images being distant from the true bleeding source. For this reason, tagged RBC scintigraphy is used to confirm the presence of active bleeding and to grossly direct further intervention, but it is not precise enough for surgical planning [@problem_id:5144701].

#### Catheter Angiography

Conventional catheter angiography, or digital subtraction angiography (DSA), involves placing a catheter directly into the mesenteric arteries (SMA or IMA) and injecting contrast to visualize the vascular anatomy and any active extravasation. Its classically cited detection threshold is approximately **$0.5$–$1.0$ $\mathrm{mL/min}$**, making it less sensitive than both modern CTA and tagged RBC scintigraphy [@problem_id:5144650].

However, the paramount advantage of catheter angiography is that it is both **diagnostic and therapeutic**. Once a bleeding site is identified, the interventional radiologist can perform superselective embolization of the culprit vessel to achieve hemostasis. Given its invasiveness and lower sensitivity, it is no longer the first-line diagnostic test. Instead, its primary role is as a therapeutic tool, typically performed after a positive CTA has localized the bleeding source. Accurate knowledge of mesenteric anatomy is crucial, whether to target a right-sided diverticulum in the SMA territory or a sigmoid source in the IMA territory [@problem_id:5144650].
