The solution must be derived from first principles, namely the conservation of mass and charge within the extracellular fluid (ECF) compartment.\n\nFirst, we establish the initial state of the patient's ECF.\nLet $M$ be the patient's body mass, $V_{ECF,0}$ be the initial ECF volume, and $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]_{0}$ be the initial bicarbonate concentration in the ECF.\nThe givens are:\n$M = 80$ kg\nECF volume fraction = $0.20$ L/kg of body weight\n$[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]_{0} = 24$ mEq/L\n\nThe initial ECF volume is calculated as:\n$$V_{ECF,0} = (0.20 \\text{ L/kg}) \\times M = (0.20 \\text{ L/kg}) \\times (80 \\text{ kg}) = 16.0 \\text{ L}$$\n\nThe initial total amount of bicarbonate, $n_{HCO_3^-, 0}$, in the ECF is the product of its initial concentration and the initial ECF volume:\n$$n_{HCO_3^-, 0} = [\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]_{0} \\times V_{ECF,0} = (24 \\text{ mEq/L}) \\times (16.0 \\text{ L}) = 384 \\text{ mEq}$$\n\nNext, we quantify the losses and gains over the specified time period of $t = 48$ hours, which is equivalent to $2$ days.\nThe patient vomits at a rate of $R_{vomit} = 1.5$ L/day. The total volume of vomited gastric fluid, $V_{vomit}$, is:\n$$V_{vomit} = R_{vomit} \\times t = (1.5 \\text{ L/day}) \\times (2 \\text{ days}) = 3.0 \\text{ L}$$\n\nThe problem states that all vomited volume is lost from the ECF with no replacement. Therefore, the final ECF volume, $V_{ECF, f}$, is:\n$$V_{ECF, f} = V_{ECF,0} - V_{vomit} = 16.0 \\text{ L} - 3.0 \\text{ L} = 13.0 \\text{ L}$$\nThis reduction in volume will concentrate all solutes remaining in the ECF, a phenomenon known as contraction alkalosis.\n\nThe core pathophysiological change is the generation of new bicarbonate. The problem states that the secretion of hydrogen ions ($H^{+}$) by gastric parietal cells is stoichiometrically coupled to the generation of bicarbonate ($HCO_3^-$) returned to the blood (ECF). Therefore, the amount of bicarbonate generated is equal to the amount of hydrogen ions lost through vomiting.\n\nThe concentration of hydrogen ions in the gastric fluid is given as $[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\text{gastric}} = 80$ mEq/L.\nThe total amount of $H^{+}$ lost, $n_{H^+, lost}$, is:\n$$n_{H^+, lost} = [\\mathrm{H}^{+}]_{\\text{gastric}} \\times V_{vomit} = (80 \\text{ mEq/L}) \\times (3.0 \\text{ L}) = 240 \\text{ mEq}$$\n\nDue to the 1:1 stoichiometry, the amount of bicarbonate generated and added to the ECF, $n_{HCO_3^-, generated}$, is:\n$$n_{HCO_3^-, generated} = n_{H^+, lost} = 240 \\text{ mEq}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that there is no renal bicarbonate excretion, a key feature of hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (the justification for this is the significant chloride loss, calculated as $(120 \\text{ mEq/L}) \\times (3.0 \\text{ L}) = 360 \\text{ mEq}$, which leads to enhanced renal bicarbonate reabsorption).\nThus, the final total amount of bicarbonate in the ECF, $n_{HCO_3^-, f}$, is the sum of the initial amount and the generated amount.\n$$n_{HCO_3^-, f} = n_{HCO_3^-, 0} + n_{HCO_3^-, generated} = 384 \\text{ mEq} + 240 \\text{ mEq} = 624 \\text{ mEq}$$\n\nFinally, the predicted post-vomiting serum bicarbonate concentration, $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]_{f}$, is the final amount of bicarbonate divided by the final ECF volume.\n$$[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]_{f} = \\frac{n_{HCO_3^-, f}}{V_{ECF, f}} = \\frac{624 \\text{ mEq}}{13.0 \\text{ L}} = 48.0 \\text{ mEq/L}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
