Starting strictly from static force equilibrium on an appropriate free-body of the wall under uniform internal pressure (without invoking pre-derived vessel formulas), derive the expression for the circumferential wall tension (force per unit length) sustained by the colonic wall.

Consider a cylindrical segment of length $L$ and inner radius $r$ subjected to uniform internal pressure $P$. To apply static equilibrium, take a free-body obtained by cutting the cylinder with a plane passing through the axis (a diametral longitudinal cut), which divides the cylinder into two mirror halves. The internal pressure acting on the curved inner surface produces a net resultant that tends to separate the two halves across the cut.\n\nFor a thin-walled cylinder, the resultant of the pressure distributed on the curved surface equals the pressure times the projected area of that surface onto the plane of the cut. The projection of the curved inner surface of the half-cylinder onto the diametral plane is a rectangle of dimensions $2r \\times L$, so the net separating force due to pressure is\n$$\nF_{P} = P \\times (2rL) \\, .\n$$\nThis force is resisted by the circumferential membrane tensions acting along the two cut edges. If $T$ denotes the circumferential wall tension (force per unit length along the cut), each cut edge of length $L$ carries a total force $T L$, and there are two edges, giving a total resisting force\n$$\nF_{T} = 2 T L \\, .\n$$\nStatic equilibrium in the direction normal to the cut plane requires $F_{T} = F_{P}$, hence\n$$\n2 T L = P \\times (2 r L) \\, .\n$$\nCanceling the common factor $2L$ yields the thin-walled cylindrical membrane relation\n$$\nT = P r \\, .\n$$\nNote that $T$ has units of $\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ when $P$ is in $\\mathrm{Pa}$ and $r$ in $\\mathrm{m}$.

Do not include units in the boxed final answer.", "solution": "The task is to determine the radial bite depth $b$ and the circumferential stitch spacing $s$ for a hand-sewn intestinal anastomosis. The derivation will be based on the provided biomechanical principles and anatomical facts.\n\nFirst, we determine the radial bite depth, $b$. The problem states two critical principles: \"The submucosa is the primary load-bearing layer of the bowel wall and must be consistently captured for a mechanically sound anastomosis,\" and the goal is to achieve \"complete capture of the load-bearing submucosa.\" The bowel wall has a given thickness of $t = 3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The submucosa, which provides the majority of the tensile strength for holding sutures, is a layer within this wall. To ensure that every suture pass reliably and securely engages this crucial layer, the needle must pass through a sufficient amount of tissue. The most direct and robust interpretation of \"complete capture\" is to ensure the suture's path is anchored well within the tissue structure. A bite depth, $b$, measured from the cut edge, that is equal to the wall thickness, $t$, guarantees that the suture passes through the full extent of the wall layers, thereby securely anchoring in the submucosa. A bite substantially smaller than $t$ would risk tearing through the weaker outer layers or missing the submucosa altogether, leading to a weak anastomosis. A bite substantially larger than $t$ would involve excessive tissue handling and could compromise the blood supply to the anastomotic edge, violating the principle of avoiding \"excess devascularization.\" Therefore, the most logical and mechanically sound choice for the bite depth is to set it equal to the wall thickness.\n$$b = t$$\nGiven $t = 3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, the radial bite depth is:\n$$b = 3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nNext, we determine the circumferential spacing between stitches, $s$. The problem specifies the goal is to \"achieve locally isotropic compression around each stitch footprint\" and to ensure \"even load distribution along the circumference.\" The term \"isotropic\" implies uniformity in all directions. In the context of the anastomosis, there are two principal directions on the bowel surface at the suture line: the radial direction (perpendicular to the cut edge) and the circumferential direction (parallel to the cut edge). The characteristic length scale in the radial direction is defined by the bite depth, $b$. The characteristic length scale in the circumferential direction is the spacing between adjacent stitches, $s$.\n\nTo achieve isotropic compression, the mechanical influence of a stitch should be approximately the same in both the radial and circumferential directions. This means the geometric \"footprint\" of tissue secured by a single stitch should be roughly square. This is achieved by setting the spacing between stitches equal to the depth of the stitch bite. If $s > b$, the compression would be anisotropic, with potential for tissue gaping between stitches under intraluminal pressure (violating the principle of even load distribution derived from Laplace's law). If $s  b$, the stitches would be unnecessarily close, increasing tissue trauma and risk of devascularization for negligible gain in strength. Therefore, the principle of locally isotropic compression directly implies that the circumferential spacing $s$ should be equal to the radial bite depth $b$.\n$$s = b$$\n\nCombining the two derivations, we have $s = b = t$. Using the given value for the wall thickness, $t = 3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, we find the values for both $b$ and $s$.\n$$b = 3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$s = 3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThe lumen diameter $D = 3\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ allows for a context check. The circumference of the anastomosis is $C = \\pi D = \\pi(30\\,\\mathrm{mm}) \\approx 94.25\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.

The guiding principles are that the number of sutures must be an integer, this integer must be the same for both the colon and the ileum, and it should be chosen to make the ileal suture spacing as close as possible to a specified target value.\n\nFirst, we define the variables and state the given values. Let $r_c$ be the radius of the colon and $r_i$ be the radius of the ileum. Let $s_{i, \\text{target}}$ be the target inter-suture arc length on the ileum. Let $N$ be the number of sutures.

If $N$ sutures are used, the circumference is partitioned into $N$ equal arcs.

This is an optimization problem: we must find the integer $N$ that minimizes the absolute error $|s_i(N) - s_{i, \\text{target}}|$.\n\nFirst, let us find the ideal, non-integer value of $N$ that would achieve the target spacing perfectly. Let this be $N_{\\text{ideal}}$.\n$N_{\\text{ideal}} = \\frac{C_i}{s_{i, \\text{target}}} = \\frac{24\\pi\\,\\text{mm}}{5\\,\\text{mm}} = \\frac{24\\pi}{5}$\n\nUsing the value $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, we find:\n$N_{\\text{ideal}} \\approx \\frac{24 \\times 3.14159}{5} \\approx 15.0796$\n\nSince the number of sutures $N$ must be an integer, the optimal choice for $N$ must be one of the integers bracketing $N_{\\text{ideal}}$.

Therefore, choosing $N=15$ sutures results in an ileal spacing that is closer to the target of $5\\,\\text{mm}$. The optimal number of sutures is $N = 15$.\n\nWith the number of sutures determined, we can now calculate the corresponding inter-suture spacing on the colonic side, $s_c$.\n$s_c = \\frac{C_c}{N} = \\frac{40\\pi\\,\\text{mm}}{15} = \\frac{8\\pi}{3}\\,\\text{mm}$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
