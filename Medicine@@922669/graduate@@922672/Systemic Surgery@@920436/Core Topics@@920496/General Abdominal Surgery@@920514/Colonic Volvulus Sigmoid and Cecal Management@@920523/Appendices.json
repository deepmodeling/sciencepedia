It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe fundamental biophysical principle governing the mechanics of a hollow viscus, such as the cecum, is the Law of Laplace. This law relates the wall tension ($T$) to the intraluminal pressure ($P$) and the radius of curvature ($r$) of the viscus. For a cylindrical structure, the circumferential tension is given by $T = P \\cdot r$. For a spherical structure, $T = \\frac{P \\cdot r}{2}$. In either case, wall tension is directly proportional to the radius, $T \\propto r$.\n\nThe risk of perforation is directly related to the stress on the bowel wall ($\\sigma$), which is the wall tension ($T$) distributed over the wall's cross-sectional area (proportional to its thickness, $w$). Thus, $\\sigma = \\frac{T}{w}$.\n\nThe problem asks to quantify the change in a \"wall stress proxy\" as the cecum distends. In the simplest and most common clinical application of the Law of Laplace, wall tension ($T$) itself is used as the direct proxy for perforation risk, implicitly assuming wall thickness ($w$) and intraluminal pressure ($P$) are relatively constant. Under this simplification, the risk proxy is directly proportional to the radius ($r$) or, equivalently, the diameter ($d$).\n\nLet's calculate the fractional change in this risk proxy.\nLet $\\text{Risk}_1$ be the risk at the threshold diameter $d_1 = 12\\ \\text{cm}$.\nLet $\\text{Risk}_2$ be the risk at the measured diameter $d_2 = 13\\ \\text{cm}$.\n\nAssuming $\\text{Risk} \\propto d$:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{Risk}_2}{\\text{Risk}_1} = \\frac{d_2}{d_1} = \\frac{13\\ \\text{cm}}{12\\ \\text{cm}} \\approx 1.0833 $$\nThis represents an increase of approximately $(1.0833 - 1) \\times 100\\% = 8.33\\%$. The term \"approximately $8\\%$\" used in the options is a reasonable rounding of this value.\n\nA more rigorous analysis would account for wall thinning. As the cecum distends, its wall stretches and thins. Assuming the volume of the wall tissue is conserved, the wall thickness ($w$) is inversely proportional to the surface area. For a cylinder of fixed length, surface area is proportional to the radius ($r$), so $w \\propto 1/r$. The wall stress would then be $\\sigma \\propto T/w \\propto r/(1/r) = r^2$. In this case, the risk would increase by a factor of $(13/12)^2 \\approx 1.174$, a $17.4\\%$ increase. For a sphere, $w \\propto 1/r^2$, so $\\sigma \\propto r/(1/r^2) = r^3$, and the risk would increase by a factor of $(13/12)^3 \\approx 1.271$, a $27.1\\%$ increase.\n\nHowever, since multiple options explicitly state an \"$8\\%$\" increase, it is clear that the intended model is the simplest one, where the risk proxy is directly proportional to the diameter/radius. We shall proceed with this validated quantitative finding.\n\nNext, we must determine the correct management based on the clinical context. The diagnosis is **cecal volvulus**. Unlike sigmoid volvulus, cecal volvulus is considered a surgical emergency. The reasons for this are:\n1.  **High risk of vascular compromise:** The twisting mechanism of the cecum (either axial rotation or a bascule-type fold) has a very high likelihood of compromising the ileocolic artery, leading to bowel ischemia and gangrene.\n2.  **Low efficacy and high risk of endoscopic decompression:** A colonoscope has difficulty passing the ileocecal valve to reach the cecum, and even if it does, successful detorsion is rare. Furthermore, attempting to manipulate a tensely distended and potentially ischemic cecum with a scope carries a substantial risk of iatrogenic perforation.\n\nTherefore, the definitive and standard treatment for cecal volvulus is urgent surgical intervention, regardless of hemodynamic stability or the absence of peritonitis. The fact that the cecal diameter ($13\\ \\text{cm}$) has exceeded the critical threshold for perforation risk ($12\\ \\text{cm}$) adds further urgency to the need for operative management.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The wall stress proxy rises by approximately $8\\%$ above the high-risk threshold (ratio $\\approx 13/12$), and this degree of distension in cecal volvulus warrants urgent operative management (for example, right hemicolectomy if bowel is viable), not endoscopic decompression.**\n- **Quantitative Justification:** The statement that the wall stress proxy rises by approximately $8\\%$ (ratio $\\approx 13/12$) is consistent with our derivation using the simplest application of the Law of Laplace. This is **Correct**.\n- **Management Decision:** The statement that cecal volvulus warrants urgent operative management and that endoscopic decompression is not the appropriate approach is the standard of care. Right hemicolectomy is a standard surgical option. This is **Correct**.\n- **Overall Verdict:** This option provides both a correct quantitative justification and the correct clinical management decision.\n\n**B. The wall stress proxy rises by approximately $8\\%$ above the threshold, but colonoscopic decompression should be attempted first with observation if successful, reserving surgery for recurrence.**\n- **Quantitative Justification:** The quantitative part is **Correct**.\n- **Management Decision:** The recommendation to attempt colonoscopic decompression first is incorrect for cecal volvulus. This approach is appropriate for sigmoid volvulus, but not for cecal volvulus due to the high risk of ischemia and the low success rate/high risk of the endoscopic procedure. This is **Incorrect**.\n- **Overall Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. The wall stress proxy is below the threshold (ratio < 1), so the risk does not mandate urgent surgery; conservative management with observation is appropriate.**\n- **Quantitative Justification:** The statement that the proxy is below the threshold (ratio < 1) is factually false, as $13 > 12$. This is **Incorrect**.\n- **Management Decision:** The recommendation for conservative management is incorrect for cecal volvulus. This is **Incorrect**.\n- **Overall Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. The wall stress proxy rises by approximately $8\\%$, but the correct immediate step is urgent flexible sigmoidoscopic detorsion and decompression, as this is first-line for all colonic volvuli.**\n- **Quantitative Justification:** The quantitative part is **Correct**.\n- **Management Decision:** The recommendation is incorrect on two counts. First, a flexible sigmoidoscope cannot reach the cecum, which is in the right colon; a full colonoscope would be required. Second, the premise that endoscopic decompression is first-line for *all* colonic volvuli is false. It is not the first-line treatment for cecal volvulus. This is **Incorrect**.\n- **Overall Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A is the only one that is correct in both its quantitative reasoning and its recommended clinical action.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5099583"}, {"introduction": "Once a diagnosis of volvulus with complications like ischemia is suspected, the patient often requires immediate resuscitation.

The relationship is:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{stressed}} = f_{s} V_{\\text{infusion}}$$\nTo find the maximum total infused volume that respects the pressure limit, which we denote $V_{\\text{max\\_infusion}}$, we set the resulting stressed volume change equal to its maximum allowed value:\n$$f_{s} V_{\\text{max\\_infusion}} = \\Delta V_{\\text{stressed, max}}$$\nSolving for $V_{\\text{max\\_infusion}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{max\\_infusion}} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{stressed, max}}}{f_{s}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated and given values:\n$$V_{\\text{max\\_infusion}} = \\frac{500 \\ \\mathrm{mL}}{0.25} = 2000 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\n$3.$ Third, the recommended initial bolus, $V_{\\text{rec}}$, must satisfy both the sepsis goal (ideally being $V_{\\text{SSC}}$) and the heart failure safety limit (not exceeding $V_{\\text{max\\_infusion}}$).
