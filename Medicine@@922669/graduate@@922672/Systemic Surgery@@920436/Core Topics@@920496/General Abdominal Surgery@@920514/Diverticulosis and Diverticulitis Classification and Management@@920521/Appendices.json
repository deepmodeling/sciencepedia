Identify the modified Hinchey stage.\n    2.  Determine the most appropriate first-line management strategy.\n    3.  Provide a contingency plan for failure to improve after $72$ hours.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is evaluated against the criteria of scientific grounding, well-posedness, and objectivity.\n\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem describes a classic clinical scenario of acute complicated diverticulitis. The terminology used—hemodynamic stability, peritoneal signs, CT findings (pericolic collection, extraluminal air), and management options (antibiotics, percutaneous drainage, sigmoid resection, Hartmann’s procedure)—are all standard and fundamental concepts in systemic surgery. The use of the modified Hinchey classification is a well-established, evidence-based method for staging the severity of diverticulitis based on imaging. The problem is firmly grounded in established medical and surgical principles.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a sufficient and consistent set of clinical and radiological data to allow for a definitive classification and the formulation of a management plan based on current clinical guidelines. The question is specific and directs the solver to a unique solution path based on established protocols.\n- **Objectivity:** The description of the patient's condition is presented using precise, objective clinical language without ambiguity or subjective interpretation.\n\nThe problem statement does not violate any of the disqualifying conditions. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A formal solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\n1.  **Classification:** The modified Hinchey classification, which is based on cross-sectional imaging (CT), is used to stage acute complicated diverticulitis. The stages are defined as follows:\n    - **Stage 0:** Uncomplicated diverticulitis (colonic wall thickening or phlegmon).\n    - **Stage Ia:** Confined pericolic inflammation.\n    - **Stage Ib:** Pericolic or mesocolic abscess.\n    - **Stage II:** Pelvic, distant intra-abdominal, or retroperitoneal abscess.\n    - **Stage III:** Generalized purulent peritonitis.\n    - **Stage IV:** Generalized fecal peritonitis.\n\n    The patient's CT shows a pericolic fluid collection (abscess) measuring $3.5 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$ in diameter. The collection is localized (pericolic) and not distant. There is no evidence of perforation causing generalized peritonitis (no free air, no diffuse fluid). Therefore, the patient's condition is correctly classified as **Modified Hinchey Stage Ib**.\n\n2.  **First-Line Management:** For a hemodynamically stable patient with Modified Hinchey Stage Ib diverticulitis, management depends on the size of the abscess and clinical stability.\n    - The patient is stable without generalized peritonitis, so non-operative management is the appropriate first line of therapy.\n    - This management consists of hospital admission for intravenous (IV) broad-spectrum antibiotics and bowel rest. The antibiotic regimen must cover Gram-negative rods and anaerobic organisms, which are the predominant pathogens in colonic infections.\n    - The role of percutaneous drainage (PCD) is guided by abscess size. While a clear cutoff is debated, many guidelines suggest PCD for abscesses larger than $4$ or $5 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$. For abscesses around $3-4 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$, such as this patient's $3.5 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$ collection, a trial of IV antibiotics alone is a reasonable option. However, proceeding with PCD if the collection is well-defined and anatomically accessible is also a valid and often-practiced strategy to achieve early source control. Thus, a plan that incorporates IV antibiotics with consideration of PCD is fully consistent with standard of care.\n\n3.  **Contingency Plan:** If a patient fails to show clinical improvement (e.g., persistent fever, leukocytosis, or worsening pain) after $48-72$ hours of appropriate non-operative management, it signifies failure to control the septic source.\n    - The next step is to repeat the CT scan to reassess the abdomen for an increase in abscess size or other complications.\n    - Following reassessment, urgent surgical intervention is indicated.\n    - The standard surgical procedure is a **sigmoid resection** to remove the diseased segment of the colon.\n    - The decision regarding how to manage the bowel ends is made intraoperatively and depends on the patient's physiologic stability and the degree of peritoneal contamination.\n        - **Hartmann’s procedure** (resection with end colostomy and closure of the rectal stump) is the safest option in the presence of significant inflammation, instability, or gross contamination.\n        - **Primary anastomosis with a diverting loop ileostomy** may be considered in a stable patient with minimal contamination. This approach offers the possibility of an earlier and simpler restoration of intestinal continuity.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Modified Hinchey Ia; initiate intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics and bowel rest only; if no improvement at $72$ hours, proceed to laparoscopic peritoneal lavage without resection**\n- **Classification:** Incorrect. The presence of a discrete $3.5 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$ fluid collection constitutes a pericolic abscess, which is Stage Ib, not Stage Ia (phlegmon).\n- **Contingency Plan:** Incorrect. Laparoscopic peritoneal lavage without resection is not the standard of care for failed non-operative management of localized complicated diverticulitis, as it fails to remove the septic source (the diseased colon).\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Modified Hinchey Ib; initiate intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting Gram-negative rods and anaerobes with computed tomography-guided percutaneous drainage of the pericolic abscess when anatomically feasible; if no improvement at $72$ hours despite appropriate source control, re-image and proceed to urgent sigmoid resection with an intraoperative decision between primary anastomosis with a diverting ileostomy versus Hartmann’s procedure based on physiologic stability and contamination**\n- **Classification:** Correct. A localized pericolic abscess corresponds to Stage Ib.\n- **Initial Management:** Correct. This plan includes the core components of therapy: admission, IV antibiotics with appropriate microbial coverage, and a sound approach to source control via PCD for a borderline-sized abscess, contingent on feasibility.\n- **Contingency Plan:** Correct. This describes the exact, evidence-based algorithm for managing failure of non-operative therapy: re-imaging followed by urgent sigmoid resection, with the appropriate intraoperative decision-making framework for anastomosis versus Hartmann's procedure.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. Modified Hinchey II; schedule elective sigmoidectomy after $6$ weeks of antibiotics; if no improvement at $72$ hours, add oral antibiotics and discharge with close outpatient follow-up**\n- **Classification:** Incorrect. Stage II denotes a distant (e.g., pelvic) abscess, not a pericolic one.\n- **Initial Management:** Incorrect. An elective sigmoidectomy is a consideration after recovery from the acute episode, not the initial treatment. The acute management requires IV medication and likely admission.\n- **Contingency Plan:** Incorrect and dangerous. De-escalating care to oral antibiotics and discharge for a patient who is failing to improve on IV therapy is a violation of the standard of care. Such a patient requires an escalation of care.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Modified Hinchey Ib; manage as an outpatient with oral antibiotics and observation; reserve percutaneous drainage for abscesses larger than $5\\ \\mathrm{cm}$; if no improvement at $72$ hours, arrange early colonoscopy to assess the lumen**\n- **Classification:** Correct.\n- **Initial Management:** Incorrect. A patient with a formed abscess and localized peritonitis requires inpatient admission and IV antibiotics, not outpatient management with oral antibiotics.\n- **Contingency Plan:** Incorrect. Colonoscopy is contraindicated in the setting of acute diverticulitis with a known abscess due to the risk of iatrogenic perforation. The correct step for a failing patient is re-imaging and surgical consultation.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Modified Hinchey III; proceed with emergent laparoscopic peritoneal lavage and no resection; if no improvement at $72$ hours, plan interval sigmoidectomy in $6$ weeks**\n- **Classification:** Incorrect. Stage III implies generalized purulent peritonitis, which is explicitly ruled out by the clinical and radiological findings (localized tenderness, no free air).\n- **Initial Management:** Incorrect. Emergent surgery is not indicated for a stable patient with a localized abscess.\n- **Contingency Plan:** Illogical. If a patient fails to improve after an initial operation, they require urgent re-evaluation and likely re-operation, not a deferred plan for another surgery in $6$ weeks.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, Option B is the only one that correctly identifies the stage of the disease and outlines a complete and appropriate management plan, including a valid contingency for therapeutic failure, that is consistent with current surgical principles and guidelines.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "5112128"}, {"introduction": "While pneumoperitoneum from diverticulitis was once an absolute indication for surgery, modern practice embraces a more nuanced, evidence-based approach.

It is a valid, solvable problem in systemic surgery.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe primary tasks are to classify the patient's condition using the WSES CT-based classification for acute colonic diverticulitis and to determine the appropriate management strategy.\n\n**1. WSES Classification of Acute Diverticulitis**\n\nThe WSES classification system categorizes acute diverticulitis based on CT findings, which has prognostic and therapeutic implications. The classification is as follows:\n\n-   **Uncomplicated Diverticulitis**:\n    -   **Stage 0**: Diverticula, possibly with colonic wall thickening.\n-   **Complicated Diverticulitis**:\n    -   **Stage 1a**: Pericolic air bubbles or phlegmon without an abscess ($5$ cm from the inflamed bowel segment).\n    -   **Stage 1b**: Abscess $\\leq 4$ cm in diameter.\n    -   **Stage 2a**: Abscess $ 4$ cm in diameter.\n    -   **Stage 2b**: Distant air (pneumoperitoneum, free air $5$ cm from the inflamed bowel segment).\n    -   **Stage 3**: Diffuse fluid (serous peritonitis) without purulent exudate.\n    -   **Stage 4**: Diffuse purulent or feculent peritonitis.\n\n**2. Application of WSES Classification to the Patient's Case**\n\nThe patient's CT findings are dispositive: \"several small foci of free intraperitoneal air seen beneath the right hemidiaphragm and along the mesentery, more than $5$ cm from the inflamed segment\". The presence of free air distant from the site of inflammation is the defining feature of **WSES Stage $2\\mathrm{b}$**.\n\nOther findings support this and rule out other stages:\n-   The presence of free air automatically classifies the condition as complicated diverticulitis, ruling out Stage $0$.\n-   The air is distant, not pericolic, ruling out Stage $1\\mathrm{a}$.\n-   The CT shows \"no drainable abscess,\" ruling out Stages $1\\mathrm{b}$ and $2\\mathrm{a}$.\n-   The CT shows \"no signs of diffuse free fluid\" and only \"a trace dependent pelvic fluid,\" ruling out Stage $3$ (diffuse serous peritonitis) and Stage $4$ (diffuse purulent/feculent peritonitis, which would present with diffuse fluid and greater systemic toxicity).\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is **WSES Stage $2\\mathrm{b}$ complicated diverticulitis**.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Management Strategy**\n\nHistorically, pneumoperitoneum due to diverticulitis was considered an absolute indication for emergency surgery. However, contemporary guidelines, including those from WSES, acknowledge that a select group of patients can be successfully managed nonoperatively (Nonoperative Management, or NOM).\n\nThe key criteria for attempting NOM in a patient with pneumoperitoneum (WSES Stage $2\\mathrm{b}$) are:\n-   **Hemodynamic Stability**: The patient must be hemodynamically stable, without signs of septic shock. This patient is stable (HR $92$, SBP $128$, lactate $1.4\\,\\mathrm{mmol/L}$).\n-   **Absence of Generalized Peritonitis**: Clinical examination must show only localized peritonitis, not diffuse tenderness, rebound, or guarding. This patient has \"localized tenderness in the left lower quadrant without rebound or guarding elsewhere.\"\n-   **Imaging Features**: The CT should ideally show only a small amount of pneumoperitoneum, minimal free fluid, and no large or uncontained abscess. This patient has \"small foci of free intraperitoneal air\" and \"a trace dependent pelvic fluid,\" fitting these criteria.\n-   **Patient Factors**: The patient should not be severely immunocompromised, as this increases the risk of NOM failure. The problem does not state the patient is immunocompromised.\n-   **Institutional Capability**: NOM must be conducted in a setting with constant inpatient monitoring (serial clinical exams, laboratory tests), broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, and the immediate availability of an operating room and surgical team should the patient's condition deteriorate.\n\nThis patient meets all the standard criteria for a trial of NOM.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Classify as WSES stage $2\\mathrm{b}$ (distant intraperitoneal free air without diffuse intra-abdominal fluid). Consider a trial of nonoperative management if the patient is hemodynamically stable without generalized peritonitis, the pneumoperitoneum is small in volume, there is no large free fluid or drainable abscess, the patient is immunocompetent, and close inpatient monitoring with serial examinations, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, and immediate surgical readiness is available, with conversion to surgery upon any clinical deterioration.**\n-   **Classification**: WSES stage $2\\mathrm{b}$. This is correct as derived above.\n-   **Management Criteria**: The listed criteria for a trial of NOM are comprehensive and fully align with current evidence-based surgical practice for this specific, highly selected patient population. The emphasis on hemodynamic stability, absence of generalized peritonitis, and the necessity for close inpatient monitoring with a rescue plan is crucial and accurate.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Classify as WSES stage $3\\mathrm{a}$ (generalized purulent peritonitis). Nonoperative management may be attempted only if an abscess is $\\leq 4 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$ and is percutaneously drained; otherwise, routine emergency surgery is indicated due to free air.**\n-   **Classification**: WSES stage $3\\mathrm{a}$. This is incorrect. Stage $3$ involves diffuse fluid/peritonitis, which is explicitly absent on the patient's CT. (Note: WSES stage $3$ does not have 'a' or 'b' subdivisions in most standard versions; it refers to diffuse serous peritonitis).\n-   **Management Criteria**: The logic is flawed. It conflates management of an abscess (Stage $1\\mathrm{b}$ or $2\\mathrm{a}$) with the presence of free air and incorrectly states that surgery is otherwise routine for free air, ignoring the nuances for selected patients.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Classify as WSES stage $1\\mathrm{a}$ (uncomplicated diverticulitis with pericolic air only). Manage as an outpatient with oral antibiotics and no observation, since the absence of an abscess predicts nonoperative success regardless of distant free air.**\n-   **Classification**: WSES stage $1\\mathrm{a}$. This is incorrect. The patient has distant free air (\"pneumoperitoneum\"), not pericolic air bubbles. This is a crucial distinction. Furthermore, any diverticulitis with free air is by definition \"complicated\".\n-   **Management Criteria**: The recommendation for outpatient management with oral antibiotics for a perforated viscus is grossly negligent and dangerous. Ignoring distant free air is a critical error.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Classify as WSES stage $2\\mathrm{b}$, but nonoperative management is appropriate as outpatient oral therapy provided lactate is $ 2.0 \\, \\mathrm{mmol/L}$, regardless of the volume of free air or the presence of peritoneal signs, because hemodynamic stability excludes perforation requiring surgery.**\n-   **Classification**: WSES stage $2\\mathrm{b}$. This is correct.\n-   **Management Criteria**: The management strategy is dangerously incorrect. Outpatient oral therapy is inappropriate for perforated diverticulitis. The assertions that management is appropriate \"regardless of the volume of free air or the presence of peritoneal signs\" are false. Generalized peritoneal signs are a contraindication to NOM. While hemodynamic stability is necessary, it is not sufficient to \"exclude perforation requiring surgery\"; the patient clearly has a perforation, and the decision for NOM vs. surgery is more complex.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, Option A provides both the correct WSES classification and the correct, evidence-based criteria for considering nonoperative management in this specific clinical scenario.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5112121"}, {"introduction": "Beyond controlling the acute infection, a crucial responsibility in managing an episode of sigmoid diverticulitis is to exclude an underlying colorectal carcinoma, which can mimic its presentation. This exercise, [@problem_id:5112135], hones your ability to critically analyze CT findings for the subtle radiological signs that suggest malignancy, even in the presence of acute inflammation. This skill is paramount for planning the correct diagnostic follow-up, ensuring that a potentially curable cancer is not overlooked after the acute inflammatory episode resolves.", "problem": "A 62-year-old man presents with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and low-grade fever. He has a known history of sigmoid diverticulosis. Computed Tomography (CT) performed in the emergency department shows focal colonic wall thickening in the sigmoid region with adjacent pericolic fat changes. He improves clinically with bowel rest and intravenous antibiotics over $72$ hours. You are asked to interpret which CT features in this context should raise concern for an underlying carcinoma rather than uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, and to propose an evidence-based diagnostic plan after clinical resolution to confirm or exclude malignancy while minimizing procedural risk.\n\nBase your reasoning on the following foundational principles and well-tested clinical-imaging facts:\n- Inflammation typically produces diffuse tissue edema, hyperemia, and inflammatory fat stranding that may extend over a relatively long segment, often with changes that are symmetric about the bowel circumference. Inflammation often correlates with prominent pericolic fat stranding that can be out of proportion to the degree of mural thickening, and the presence of inflamed diverticula supports diverticulitis.\n- Malignant tumors arise from focal clonal proliferation with desmoplastic response and tissue invasion, which often produces a relatively short-segment, asymmetric or eccentric mural thickening with abrupt shouldered margins and may be associated with pathologic lymphadenopathy due to metastatic spread. Fat stranding is usually less pronounced than the degree of mural thickening unless there is superimposed perforation.\n- After an episode of acute diverticulitis, endoluminal evaluation is generally deferred until clinical resolution to reduce the risk of perforation. Colonoscopy allows direct visualization and biopsy to confirm malignancy. If a high-grade stricture prevents passage, operative management with oncologic principles is indicated. Computed Tomography colonography is generally avoided during acute inflammation and is considered only when colonoscopy is incomplete and the acute inflammatory phase has resolved.\n\nWhich option best identifies the CT features that suggest carcinoma rather than diverticulitis, and pairs them with the most appropriate diagnostic plan after clinical resolution to confirm or exclude malignancy?\n\nA. CT features: Short-segment (for example, $5 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$) eccentric wall thickening with abrupt shouldered margins and pericolic lymphadenopathy (for example, short-axis node diameter $\\geq 1 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$), with pericolic fat stranding that is mild relative to mural thickening. Plan: After clinical resolution, perform colonoscopy at $6$ to $8$ weeks for direct visualization and biopsy; if the lesion is non-traversable due to a high-grade stricture, proceed with staging CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis and plan segmental colectomy with oncologic technique.\n\nB. CT features: Long-segment (for example, $ > 10 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$) symmetric concentric wall thickening with marked pericolic fat stranding out of proportion to mural thickening, smoothly tapering margins, and numerous adjacent diverticula without enlarged nodes. Plan: If symptoms resolve, no colonoscopy is needed; resume routine age-appropriate screening in $10$ years.\n\nC. CT features: Short-segment mass-like thickening with shouldering and an adjacent gas-containing abscess during the acute phase. Plan: Arrange immediate CT-guided percutaneous core biopsy of the colonic mass during the acute inflammatory episode to establish tissue diagnosis.\n\nD. CT features: A $3$ cm segment of mural thickening adjacent to multiple diverticula, no discrete lymph nodes, and prominent engorged vasa recta in the mesentery (comb sign). Plan: Schedule CT colonography within $1$ week of symptom resolution to avoid colonoscopic perforation risk and continue long-term suppressive antibiotics instead of endoscopic biopsy.\n\nE. CT features: Focal “apple-core” lesion with asymmetric wall thickening, shouldered margins, and multiple rounded pericolic nodes. Plan: After $3$ days of antibiotics for presumed diverticulitis, proceed directly to elective sigmoid colectomy without endoscopic evaluation to avoid perforation risk from colonoscopy.", "solution": "The problem requires the identification of Computed Tomography (CT) features that distinguish a colonic carcinoma from acute diverticulitis and the formulation of an appropriate subsequent diagnostic plan. The analysis will be based on the provided foundational principles.\n\nFirst, I will validate the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n- Patient: 62-year-old man.\n- Symptoms: Left lower quadrant abdominal pain, low-grade fever.\n- History: Sigmoid diverticulosis.\n- Initial CT findings: Focal colonic wall thickening in the sigmoid region, adjacent pericolic fat changes.\n- Clinical course: Improvement with bowel rest and intravenous antibiotics over $72$ hours.\n- Foundational principles regarding the radiological and clinical differentiation and management of inflammation versus malignancy.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, presenting a common and important clinical dilemma. The provided principles are accurate reflections of established radiological criteria and surgical management guidelines. The problem is well-posed, objective, complete, and asks for the application of the provided principles to a clinical vignette. It is a valid problem.\n\nNext, I will derive the correct approach based on the principles.\n1.  **CT Features Suggesting Carcinoma:** The principles state that malignancy is suggested by a \"relatively short-segment, asymmetric or eccentric mural thickening with abrupt shouldered margins and...pathologic lymphadenopathy\". Furthermore, fat stranding is typically \"less pronounced than the degree of mural thickening\".\n2.  **CT Features Suggesting Diverticulitis:** The principles state that inflammation is suggested by changes over a \"relatively long segment\", \"symmetric\" thickening, and \"prominent pericolic fat stranding that can be out of proportion to the degree of mural thickening\".\n3.  **Diagnostic Plan for Suspected Malignancy:** The principles mandate deferring endoluminal evaluation \"until clinical resolution to reduce the risk of perforation\". The primary modality is \"colonoscopy\" because it \"allows direct visualization and biopsy to confirm malignancy\". If a \"high-grade stricture prevents passage\", the correct course is \"operative management with oncologic principles\".\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must pair the specific CT features of carcinoma with a plan that involves a delayed colonoscopy ($6-8$ weeks is a standard interval for inflammation to resolve) for biopsy. The plan must also correctly identify the next steps (staging and oncologic resection) if the colonoscopy is incomplete due to a non-traversable, suspicious lesion.\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option.\n\n**A. CT features: Short-segment (for example, $5 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$) eccentric wall thickening with abrupt shouldered margins and pericolic lymphadenopathy (for example, short-axis node diameter $\\geq 1 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$), with pericolic fat stranding that is mild relative to mural thickening. Plan: After clinical resolution, perform colonoscopy at $6$ to $8$ weeks for direct visualization and biopsy; if the lesion is non-traversable due to a high-grade stricture, proceed with staging CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis and plan segmental colectomy with oncologic technique.**\n\n- **Analysis of CT Features:** This description aligns perfectly with the provided principles for malignancy. It lists short-segment involvement, eccentric thickening, shouldered margins, lymphadenopathy, and disproportionately mild fat stranding. The quantitative examples ($5 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$ thickness, $\\geq 1 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$ node) are standard radiological criteria for suspicion of malignancy.\n- **Analysis of Plan:** This plan is entirely consistent with the provided management principles. It correctly defers the invasive procedure until clinical resolution, specifies the standard waiting period ($6$ to $8$ weeks), identifies colonoscopy with biopsy as the definitive diagnostic test, and correctly outlines the management for a non-traversable lesion (staging followed by oncologic resection).\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. CT features: Long-segment (for example, $ > 10 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$) symmetric concentric wall thickening with marked pericolic fat stranding out of proportion to mural thickening, smoothly tapering margins, and numerous adjacent diverticula without enlarged nodes. Plan: If symptoms resolve, no colonoscopy is needed; resume routine age-appropriate screening in $10$ years.**\n\n- **Analysis of CT Features:** These features are the classic signs of acute diverticulitis, as detailed in the provided principles (long segment, symmetric thickening, prominent fat stranding). They argue *against* a diagnosis of carcinoma.\n- **Analysis of Plan:** The plan to forego follow-up colonoscopy is incorrect. Guidelines recommend endoscopic evaluation after an episode of complicated or radiologically equivocal diverticulitis to rule out an underlying malignancy, which can be obscured by acute inflammation. The patient has \"focal colonic wall thickening\", which warrants investigation. Dismissing this as benign without endoscopic confirmation is not the standard of care.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. CT features: Short-segment mass-like thickening with shouldering and an adjacent gas-containing abscess during the acute phase. Plan: Arrange immediate CT-guided percutaneous core biopsy of the colonic mass during the acute inflammatory episode to establish tissue diagnosis.**\n\n- **Analysis of CT Features:** The presence of an abscess signifies complicated diverticulitis (Hinchey Stage I/II), though a perforated carcinoma is in the differential diagnosis.\n- **Analysis of Plan:** The plan is dangerous and contradicts the provided principles. The principles explicitly state to defer evaluation \"to reduce the risk of perforation\". Biopsying an inflamed, potentially infected colon wall, especially in the presence of an abscess, carries a high risk of iatrogenic perforation and, if malignant, peritoneal tumor seeding. The standard of care is to manage the acute process first (e.g., antibiotics, possibly percutaneous drainage of the abscess) and perform diagnostic evaluation later.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. CT features: A $3$ cm segment of mural thickening adjacent to multiple diverticula, no discrete lymph nodes, and prominent engorged vasa recta in the mesentery (comb sign). Plan: Schedule CT colonography within $1$ week of symptom resolution to avoid colonoscopic perforation risk and continue long-term suppressive antibiotics instead of endoscopic biopsy.**\n\n- **Analysis of CT Features:** While the segment is short ($3$ cm), the \"comb sign\" is a strong indicator of active inflammation, not malignancy. The absence of lymphadenopathy also favors an inflammatory etiology.\n- **Analysis of Plan:** The plan has multiple errors. CT colonography is a second-line test, indicated \"only when colonoscopy is incomplete,\" not as the primary follow-up modality, because it does not permit biopsy. Performing it \"within $1$ week\" is too early, as inflammation will not have fully resolved. There is no established role for \"long-term suppressive antibiotics\" in preventing diverticulitis recurrence or treating colon cancer.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. CT features: Focal “apple-core” lesion with asymmetric wall thickening, shouldered margins, and multiple rounded pericolic nodes. Plan: After $3$ days of antibiotics for presumed diverticulitis, proceed directly to elective sigmoid colectomy without endoscopic evaluation to avoid perforation risk from colonoscopy.**\n\n- **Analysis of CT Features:** This is a textbook radiological description of a constricting colorectal cancer.\n- **Analysis of Plan:** The plan is overly aggressive and deviates from the principles. The patient has improved clinically, meaning this is not an emergency. The principles state that \"Colonoscopy allows direct visualization and biopsy to confirm malignancy.\" Proceeding to a major resection without attempting to obtain a tissue diagnosis is not standard procedure, except in cases of obstruction, perforation, or a non-traversable lesion found during endoscopy. The risk of perforation from a carefully performed colonoscopy after inflammation resolves is low and is accepted in order to obtain a crucial preoperative diagnosis. A waiting period of only $3$ days is insufficient for inflammation to resolve.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "5112135"}]}
