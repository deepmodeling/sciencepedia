All necessary data are provided, and the task is to derive a standard formula and apply it.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a participant has an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and let $\\neg D$ be the event that the participant does not have an AAA. Let $T^+$ be the event that the ultrasound test result is positive, and let $T^-$ be the event that the test result is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following information, which we translate into the language of probability theory:\n1.  The prevalence of AAA is $p = P(D) = 0.05$. Consequently, the probability of not having AAA is $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test is $Se = P(T^+|D) = 0.95$. This is the probability of a positive test result given that the participant has the disease.\n3.  The specificity of the test is $Sp = P(T^-|\\neg D) = 0.98$. This is the probability of a negative test result given that the participant does not have the disease.\n\nFrom the definition of specificity, we can deduce the probability of a positive test result in a disease-free individual, which is also known as the false positive rate. This is the complement of specificity:\n$$ P(T^+|\\neg D) = 1 - P(T^-|\\neg D) = 1 - Sp $$\n\nThe quantity to be calculated is the positive predictive value (PPV), which is defined as the posterior probability of having the disease given a positive test result. This is denoted as $P(D|T^+)$.\n\nThe first part of the task is to derive an expression for PPV using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:\n$$ P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of receiving a positive test result. It can be calculated using the law of total probability by considering the two mutually exclusive scenarios: testing positive with the disease, and testing positive without the disease.\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|\\neg D)P(\\neg D) $$\n\nNow, we substitute the terms for prevalence ($p$), sensitivity ($Se$), and specificity ($Sp$) into this expression:\n$$ P(T^+) = (Se)(p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p) $$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $P(T^+)$ back into the Bayes' theorem formula for PPV, we obtain the desired general expression for PPV in terms of $p$, $Se$, and $Sp$:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|\\neg D)P(\\neg D)} = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)} $$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nThe second part of the task is to evaluate this expression for the given values:\n$p = 0.05$\n$Se = 0.95$\n$Sp = 0.98$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived formula for PPV. First, we calculate the numerator, which represents the probability of a true positive result in the population:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = Se \\cdot p = 0.95 \\times 0.05 = 0.0475 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the terms in the denominator. The first term is the same as the numerator: $Se \\cdot p = 0.0475$.\nThe second term in the denominator represents the probability of a false positive result in the population:\n$$ (1 - Sp)(1 - p) = (1 - 0.98)(1 - 0.05) = (0.02)(0.95) = 0.019 $$\n\nThe denominator, which is the total probability of a positive test, is the sum of these two terms:\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.0475 + 0.019 = 0.0665 $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the PPV by dividing the numerator by the denominator:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{0.0475}{0.0665} $$\n\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$ PPV \\approx 0.7142857... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $7$, $1$, $4$, $2$. The fifth significant figure is $8$, which is $\\ge 5$, so we round up the fourth figure.\n$$ PPV \\approx 0.7143 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.7143}$$", "id": "5076592"}, {"introduction": "Once a small Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is detected, the focus shifts from screening to surveillance, where the goal is to monitor growth and intervene at the optimal time.
