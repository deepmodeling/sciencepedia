This practice grounds your understanding of confounding by asking you to derive the back-door adjustment formula from first principles for the classic confounding structure, represented by the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) $X \\leftarrow Z \\rightarrow Y$. By working through the algebra that connects the graph, the rules of probability, and the semantics of the $do$-operator, you will see precisely how conditioning on a confounder $Z$ allows for the identification of the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ [@problem_id:4961103].", "problem": "A hospital evaluates the effect of initiating an anticoagulant therapy on thirty-day stroke outcomes using observational data. Let $X \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote whether the anticoagulant is initiated on day $1$ ($X=1$) or not ($X=0$). Let $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote the indicator of stroke by day $30$, and let $Z \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote a baseline comorbidity indicator ($Z=1$ indicates high comorbidity burden, $Z=0$ indicates low comorbidity burden) as measured by a validated index. Investigators judge that comorbidity $Z$ affects both treatment selection $X$ and outcome $Y$, and that there is no direct effect of $X$ on $Y$ except any spurious association induced by $Z$. Under these assumptions, the causal structure is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with edges $Z \\rightarrow X$ and $Z \\rightarrow Y$, that is, $X \\leftarrow Z \\rightarrow Y$.\n\nStarting from the following fundamental bases:\n- The rules of probability (law of total probability and conditional probability),\n- The Markov factorization of a distribution consistent with a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG),\n- The intervention semantics of the $\\mathrm{do}$-operator from Structural Causal Models (SCMs),\n\nderive algebraically an adjustment expression that implements the back-door criterion to identify $P(Y \\mid \\mathrm{do}(X=x))$ in the DAG $X \\leftarrow Z \\rightarrow Y$.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "### Derivation of the Adjustment Expression\n\nThe objective is to find an expression for the interventional probability $P(Y=y \\mid \\mathrm{do}(X=x))$ in terms of the observational distribution $P(X, Y, Z)$. The variable $Z$ is a confounder, creating a non-causal statistical association between $X$ and $Y$ through the path $X \\leftarrow Z \\rightarrow Y$. The back-door criterion provides a method to adjust for such confounding.\n\nThe set of variables $\\{Z\\}$ satisfies the back-door criterion relative to the ordered pair $(X,Y)$ because:\n1.  No node in $\\{Z\\}$ is a descendant of $X$ in the DAG.\n2.  $\\{Z\\}$ blocks every path between $X$ and $Y$ that contains an arrow into $X$ (namely, the path $X \\leftarrow Z \\rightarrow Y$).\n\nWe will derive the back-door adjustment formula using the specified fundamental principles.\n\nLet the pre-interventional joint probability distribution be $P(x,y,z)$. Based on the specified DAG $X \\leftarrow Z \\rightarrow Y$, we can use the Markov factorization rule to write the joint distribution as the product of the conditional probabilities of each node given its parents:\n$$P(x,y,z) = P(x|\\text{pa}(X)) P(y|\\text{pa}(Y)) P(z|\\text{pa}(Z))$$\nIn this DAG, the parents are $\\text{pa}(X) = \\{Z\\}$, $\\text{pa}(Y) = \\{Z\\}$, and $\\text{pa}(Z) = \\emptyset$. Thus, the factorization is:\n$$P(x,y,z) = P(x|z) P(y|z) P(z)$$\n\nThe quantity of interest is $P(Y=y \\mid \\mathrm{do}(X=x))$. According to the semantics of the `do`-operator, this corresponds to the probability of $Y=y$ in a modified system where the mechanism for $X$ is replaced by simply setting $X=x$. The post-intervention distribution, denoted $P(y,z | \\mathrm{do}(X=x))$, can be derived from the pre-intervention joint distribution using the truncated factorization formula (also known as the G-computation formula or manipulation theorem). This involves deleting the factor corresponding to the intervened variable, $P(x|z)$, from the joint distribution product:\n$$P(y,z \\mid \\mathrm{do}(X=x)) = P(y|z) P(z)$$\nTo find the marginal probability of $Y$ under the intervention, we sum over all possible values of $z$:\n$$P(Y=y \\mid \\mathrm{do}(X=x)) = \\sum_{z \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(y,z \\mid \\mathrm{do}(X=x)) = \\sum_{z \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(y|z) P(z)$$\nNow, we must show that this result is an instance of the back-door adjustment formula. The back-door adjustment formula for a set of deconfounding variables $S$ is $P(Y=y \\mid \\mathrm{do}(X=x)) = \\sum_s P(Y=y \\mid X=x, S=s) P(S=s)$. For our problem, with $S=\\{Z\\}$, this formula would be:\n$$P(Y=y \\mid \\mathrm{do}(X=x)) = \\sum_{z \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(Y=y \\mid X=x, Z=z) P(Z=z)$$\nTo reconcile our derived expression with this formula, we examine the conditional independence properties of the given DAG, $X \\leftarrow Z \\rightarrow Y$. According to the rules of d-separation, conditioning on $Z$ blocks the only path between $X$ and $Y$. Therefore, $Y$ is conditionally independent of $X$ given $Z$, denoted as $(Y \\perp X \\mid Z)$. This conditional independence implies:\n$$P(Y=y \\mid X=x, Z=z) = P(Y=y \\mid Z=z)$$\nSubstituting this equality into the general back-door adjustment formula gives:\n$$P(Y=y \\mid \\mathrm{do}(X=x)) = \\sum_{z \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(Y=y \\mid Z=z) P(Z=z)$$\nThis expression is the derived adjustment formula, which correctly implements the back-door criterion for the given DAG.\n\nAn important consequence of this result is that the right-hand side is simply the marginal probability $P(Y=y)$ calculated by the law of total probability. This means $P(Y=y \\mid \\mathrm{do}(X=x))$ is not a function of $x$. This is expected, as the DAG $X \\leftarrow Z \\rightarrow Y$ contains no directed path from $X$ to $Y$, signifying that $X$ has no causal effect on $Y$.\n\n### Computation of the Interventional Quantity\n\nWe are asked to compute $P(Y=1 \\mid \\mathrm{do}(X=1))$. Using the formula derived above:\n$$P(Y=1 \\mid \\mathrm{do}(X=1)) = \\sum_{z \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(Y=1 \\mid Z=z) P(Z=z)$$\nThis can be expanded as:\n$$P(Y=1 \\mid \\mathrm{do}(X=1)) = P(Y=1 \\mid Z=1)P(Z=1) + P(Y=1 \\mid Z=0)P(Z=0)$$\nWe are given the following parameters for the data-generating mechanism:\n-   $P(Z=1) = \\pi = \\frac{3}{10}$.\n-   $P(Z=0) = 1 - \\pi = 1 - \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{7}{10}$.\n-   $P(Y=1 \\mid Z=1) = \\beta_1 = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n-   $P(Y=1 \\mid Z=0) = \\beta_0 = \\frac{1}{10}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression:\n$$P(Y=1 \\mid \\mathrm{do}(X=1)) = \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right) \\left(\\frac{7}{10}\\right)$$\nWe perform the calculation:\n$$P(Y=1 \\mid \\mathrm{do}(X=1)) = \\frac{6}{50} + \\frac{7}{100}$$\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $100$.\n$$P(Y=1 \\mid \\mathrm{do}(X=1)) = \\frac{6 \\times 2}{50 \\times 2} + \\frac{7}{100} = \\frac{12}{100} + \\frac{7}{100}$$\n$$P(Y=1 \\mid \\mathrm{do}(X=1)) = \\frac{19}{100}$$\nThe interventional probability $P(Y=1 \\mid \\mathrm{do}(X=1))$ is exactly $\\frac{19}{100}$.

Two latent variables are postulated: $U_X$ capturing a patient’s inherent tendency to accept pharmacotherapy and adhere to physician recommendations, and $U_Y$ capturing a patient’s underlying cardiovascular vulnerability (e.g., subclinical burden of atherosclerosis and frailty). Investigators hypothesize the following qualitative mechanisms, each plausible in clinical practice: $U_X$ predisposes patients to initiate therapy $X$ and also to have higher health-seeking index $Z$; $U_Y$ predisposes to adverse events $Y$ and also to higher health-seeking index $Z$ (because vulnerable patients seek more preventive care). The investigators believe $U_X$ and $U_Y$ are independent in the target population due to distinct etiologic origins (behavioral trait versus biological vulnerability).

The M-bias graph is given by independent latent variables $U_X$ and $U_Y$ with arrows $U_X \\to X$, $U_Y \\to Y$, and both $U_X \\to Z$ and $U_Y \\to Z$; thus $Z$ is a collider on the path $X \\leftarrow U_X \\to Z \\leftarrow U_Y \\to Y$.

The crude (unadjusted) association between $X$ and $Y$ is an unbiased estimate of the causal effect.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Effect of Adjusting for Z**:\n    -   \"Adjusting for $Z$\" (e.g., in a regression model or through stratification) means we are **conditioning** on $Z$.\n    -   A fundamental rule of d-separation is that conditioning on a collider **unblocks** the path that it had previously blocked.\n    -   By conditioning on $Z$, we open the non-causal path $X \\leftarrow U_X \\to Z \\leftarrow U_Y \\to Y$.\n    -   This introduces a spurious, non-causal association between $X$ and $Y$. This phenomenon is known as collider-stratification bias, or, in this specific structure, M-bias.\n    -   The logical mechanism is as follows: The causes of $Z$, which are $U_X$ and $U_Y$, are marginally independent ($U_X \\perp U_Y$). However, upon conditioning on their common effect $Z$, they become conditionally dependent ($U_X \\not\\perp U_Y \\mid Z$). This induced association between $U_X$ and $U_Y$ allows statistical information to flow from $X$ to $Y$ through the path $X \\leftarrow U_X \\dots U_Y \\to Y$, creating bias.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The M-bias graph is given by independent latent variables $U_X$ and $U_Y$ with arrows $U_X \\to X$, $U_Y \\to Y$, and both $U_X \\to Z$ and $U_Y \\to Z$; thus $Z$ is a collider on the path $X \\leftarrow U_X \\to Z \\leftarrow U_Y \\to Y$. Conditioning on $Z$ opens this non-causal path and induces association between $X$ and $Y$ even if $X$ has no causal effect on $Y$.**\n-   The description of the graph is accurate based on our derivation.\n-   The identification of $Z$ as a collider on the specified path is correct.\n-   The conclusion that conditioning on $Z$ opens this path and induces a spurious association is correct.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The correct graph has arrows $Z \\to X$ and $Z \\to Y$ with $Z$ as a pre-treatment confounder; therefore, adjusting for $Z$ blocks the backdoor path and cannot induce bias.**\n-   This statement proposes a different graph structure where $Z$ is a common cause of $X$ and $Y$. This contradicts the problem description, which explicitly states that $Z$ does not directly cause $X$ or $Y$. In the structure proposed by this option, $Z$ would be a standard confounder, and adjusting for it would be necessary to *remove* bias, which is the opposite of the M-bias paradox.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The correct graph features a mediator with arrows $X \\to Z \\to Y$; therefore, adjusting for $Z$ only blocks the indirect effect of $X$ on $Y$ and does not create spurious association.**\n-   This proposes a mediation structure. This is factually incorrect based on the problem statement, which specifies that $Z$ is a *pre-treatment* variable measured before $X$. Temporally, $X$ cannot cause $Z$, so the arrow $X \\to Z$ is impossible.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. If $U_X$ and $U_Y$ are independent and $Z$ is their common effect, then conditioning on $Z$ preserves independence between $U_X$ and $U_Y$; therefore, adjusting for $Z$ cannot open a backdoor path.**\n-   The premise of this statement is fundamentally false. A core principle of conditional independence and d-separation is that conditioning on a common effect (a collider) *induces* dependency between its previously independent causes. That is, if $U_X \\perp U_Y$, then in general $U_X \\not\\perp U_Y \\mid Z$. The statement claims the opposite.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The paradox arises because, with $U_X \\perp U_Y$ and both $U_X \\to Z$ and $U_Y \\to Z$, $Z$ is a collider. By the rules of d-separation, conditioning on a collider induces dependence $U_X \\not\\perp U_Y \\mid Z$ and opens the previously blocked path $X \\leftarrow U_X \\to Z \\leftarrow U_Y \\to Y$, creating bias in estimates of the causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ when adjusting for $Z$.**\n-   This statement correctly identifies $Z$ as a collider given the independence of $U_X$ and $U_Y$ and the arrows into $Z$.\n-   It correctly and formally states the consequence of conditioning on a collider according to the rules of d-separation: it induces conditional dependence ($U_X \\not\\perp U_Y \\mid Z$).\n-   It correctly links this induced dependence to the opening of the specific backdoor path, which creates bias. This is a precise and detailed explanation of the M-bias mechanism.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\nBoth options A and E correctly describe the DAG and the resulting bias from adjusting for $Z$. Option E provides a more formal explanation of the underlying mechanism ($U_X \\not\\perp U_Y \\mid Z$), while option A states the outcome more directly. Both are fully correct based on the problem statement and the principles of causal inference.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "4961093"}]}
