The correct factor in a multiple regression is the conditional reliability ratio $\\rho_c$.\n*   **B:** Correct. It correctly states that $\\hat{a}$ is unbiased ($E[\\hat{a}]=a$), correctly identifies the attenuation factor for $\\hat{b}_{\\text{naive}}$ as the conditional reliability ratio $\\rho_c$, correctly derives the formula for $\\rho_c$, correctly computes its value as $3/4$, and correctly describes the resulting attenuation and correction for the indirect effect.\n*   **C:** Incorrect. The premise that $\\hat{a}$ is biased is false.\n*   **D:** Correct. Regression calibration is a valid method for correcting measurement error bias. For the linear Gaussian case specified, replacing the unobserved $M$ with its expectation conditional on observed data ($E[M \\mid X, M^*]$) yields an asymptotically unbiased estimate of $b$.
