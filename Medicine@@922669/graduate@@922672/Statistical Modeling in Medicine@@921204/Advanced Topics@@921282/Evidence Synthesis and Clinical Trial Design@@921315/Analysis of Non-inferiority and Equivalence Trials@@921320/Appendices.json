Given that the non-adherence fraction $d$ is typically less than $0.5$ (if $d > 0.5$, a majority of participants are crossing over), the term $(1 - 2d)$ is a positive constant between $0$ and $1$. Consequently, $|\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}}|  |\\Delta_{\\text{PP}}|$ for any $d > 0$.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as **dilution bias** or **bias towards the null hypothesis of no effect**. The observed treatment effect is biased toward zero.\n\nIn a non-inferiority trial, the objective is to demonstrate that a new treatment $T$ is not unacceptably worse than a standard control $C$. This is formalized by testing the null hypothesis $H_0: \\Delta_{\\text{PP}} \\ge \\delta$ against the alternative $H_1: \\Delta_{\\text{PP}}  \\delta$, where $\\delta > 0$ is a pre-specified non-inferiority margin. Non-inferiority is concluded if the upper bound of the confidence interval for the risk difference falls below $\\delta$.\n\nThe dilution bias is particularly pernicious in this context. If the new treatment is truly inferior to the control ($p_T > p_C$, so $\\Delta_{\\text{PP}} > 0$), non-adherence will bias the observed estimate $\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}}$ downwards, closer to zero. This makes the new treatment appear more similar to the control than it actually is. As a result, even if the true difference $\\Delta_{\\text{PP}}$ is clinically meaningful and potentially close to or exceeding the margin $\\delta$, the biased estimate $\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}}$ might be small enough that its confidence interval incorrectly suggests non-inferiority. The trial's ability to detect a true difference (its \"assay sensitivity\") is compromised, and this lack of sensitivity can be mistaken for evidence of non-inferiority. The same logic applies to equivalence trials, where biasing the estimate toward zero makes it easier to fall within the equivalence margins $[-\\delta, \\delta]$. This can lead to the erroneous conclusion that an inferior drug is non-inferior or equivalent.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation of the Bias**\n\nWe are given the parameters: $p_{C} = 0.20$, $p_{T} = 0.23$, and $d = 0.15$.\nFirst, calculate the per-protocol risk difference, $\\Delta_{\\text{PP}}$.\n$$\\Delta_{\\text{PP}} = p_{T} - p_{C} = 0.23 - 0.20 = 0.03$$\nNow, use the derived formula for the bias, $B$.\n$$B = -2d\\Delta_{\\text{PP}}$$\n$$B = -2(0.15)(0.03)$$\n$$B = -(0.30)(0.03)$$\n$$B = -0.009$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. In standard form, this is $-9.00 \\times 10^{-3}$. Therefore, the value is $-0.00900$. This negative bias of $-0.00900$ pulls the observed risk difference, $\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}}$, from the true value of $0.03$ down to $\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}} = 0.03 - 0.009 = 0.021$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.00900}$$", "id": "4951288"}]}
