It provides a complete and consistent set of givens, adheres to established scientific principles, and is formulated in precise, objective language. The task is to derive the estimator for an indirect comparison and its corresponding variance, a fundamental procedure in this statistical domain.\n\nThe problem describes a three-treatment network involving treatments $A$, $B$, and $C$. The available evidence consists of direct comparisons between $A$ and $B$, and between $B$ and $C$. There is no direct evidence comparing $A$ and $C$. The goal is to estimate the relative effect of $A$ versus $C$, denoted $d_{AC}$, using the available information.\n\nLet $\\theta_A$, $\\theta_B$, and $\\theta_C$ represent the true mean effects of treatments $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively, on an additive scale. The relative treatment effect between any two treatments $X$ and $Y$ is defined as $d_{XY} = \\theta_X - \\theta_Y$.\n\nThe core principle that enables the synthesis of evidence across a network is the consistency assumption. This assumption posits that all treatment effects are coherent and can be mapped onto a single underlying framework defined by the treatment-specific parameters $\\theta_t$. For our three-treatment chain $A-B-C$, the consistency equation relates the direct and indirect effects as follows:\n$$\nd_{AC} = d_{AB} + d_{BC}\n$$\nThis can be shown by substituting the definitions of the relative effects in terms of the absolute effects:\n$$\nd_{AB} + d_{BC} = (\\theta_A - \\theta_B) + (\\theta_B - \\theta_C) = \\theta_A - \\theta_C = d_{AC}\n$$\nThe consistency equation provides the theoretical foundation for estimating $d_{AC}$ indirectly.\n\nWe are given two independent, unbiased estimators for the direct comparisons:\n$1$. $\\hat{d}_{AB}$, an estimator for $d_{AB}$ with variance $v_{AB} = \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AB})$.\n$2$. $\\hat{d}_{BC}$, an estimator for $d_{BC}$ with variance $v_{BC} = \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{BC})$.\n\nThe unbiasedness implies that $E[\\hat{d}_{AB}] = d_{AB}$ and $E[\\hat{d}_{BC}] = d_{BC}$. The independence implies that their covariance is zero: $\\operatorname{Cov}(\\hat{d}_{AB}, \\hat{d}_{BC}) = 0$.\n\nTo derive the indirect estimator for $d_{AC}$, which we shall denote $\\hat{d}_{AC}$, we use the \"plug-in\" principle based on the consistency equation. We substitute the estimators for the true effects into the equation:\n$$\n\\hat{d}_{AC} = \\hat{d}_{AB} + \\hat{d}_{BC}\n$$\nThis expression provides the point estimate for the indirect comparison of $A$ versus $C$. We can verify that this estimator is unbiased for $d_{AC}$. Using the linearity of the expectation operator:\n$$\nE[\\hat{d}_{AC}] = E[\\hat{d}_{AB} + \\hat{d}_{BC}] = E[\\hat{d}_{AB}] + E[\\hat{d}_{BC}]\n$$\nSubstituting the known expected values:\n$$\nE[\\hat{d}_{AC}] = d_{AB} + d_{BC}\n$$\nBy the consistency equation, $d_{AB} + d_{BC} = d_{AC}$, so we have:\n$$\nE[\\hat{d}_{AC}] = d_{AC}\n$$\nThus, the indirect estimator $\\hat{d}_{AC}$ is an unbiased estimator of the true relative effect $d_{AC}$.\n\nNext, we derive the sampling variance of this indirect estimator, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AC})$. The variance of a sum of two random variables is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(X+Y) = \\operatorname{Var}(X) + \\operatorname{Var}(Y) + 2\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)\n$$\nApplying this to our estimator $\\hat{d}_{AC}$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AC}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AB} + \\hat{d}_{BC}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AB}) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{BC}) + 2\\operatorname{Cov}(\\hat{d}_{AB}, \\hat{d}_{BC})\n$$\nThe problem statement specifies that the evidence for $A$ versus $B$ and $B$ versus $C$ comes from disjoint sets of trials, ensuring that the estimators $\\hat{d}_{AB}$ and $\\hat{d}_{BC}$ are statistically independent. For independent random variables, the covariance is zero.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(\\hat{d}_{AB}, \\hat{d}_{BC}) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this into the variance equation simplifies it to:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AC}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AB}) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{BC})\n$$\nFinally, using the provided notation for the variances, $v_{AB} = \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AB})$ and $v_{BC} = \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{BC})$, we obtain the final expression for the variance of the indirect estimator:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AC}) = v_{AB} + v_{BC}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that for an indirect comparison, the point estimate is the sum of the constituent direct estimates, and its variance is the sum of their variances, under the assumption of independence.\n\nTherefore, the two quantities requested are the indirect estimator $\\hat{d}_{AC} = \\hat{d}_{AB} + \\hat{d}_{BC}$ and its sampling variance $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{d}_{AC}) = v_{AB} + v_{BC}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\hat{d}_{AB} + \\hat{d}_{BC} & v_{AB} + v_{BC} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "4977502"}, {"introduction": "A network meta-analysis is only valid if the underlying evidence is coherent, meaning that direct and indirect estimates of the same treatment effect are in agreement.

Under this modeling foundation, construct the single-degree-of-freedom Cochran’s $Q$-type statistic for incoherence in this triangle as a Wald-type test of the loop consistency constraint derived from first principles.

This is a standard procedure in Network Meta-Analysis (NMA). The validity of the problem is confirmed, as it is scientifically grounded in statistical theory, well-posed with all necessary data provided, and objective in its formulation.\n\nLet the true, unobserved log-risk ratios for the comparisons be denoted by $\\delta_{AB}$, $\\delta_{BC}$, and $\\delta_{AC}$. The hypothesis of coherence, or consistency, in a closed triangular network $A-B-C$ posits that the direct effect between any two treatments is equal to the indirect effect derived through the third treatment. On the log-risk ratio scale, this is expressed by the linear relationship:\n$$ \\delta_{AC} = \\delta_{AB} + \\delta_{BC} $$\nThis can be rewritten as $\\delta_{AB} + \\delta_{BC} - \\delta_{AC} = 0$.

For a parameter estimate $\\hat{\\theta}$ with null value $\\theta_0$ and variance $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta})$, the Wald statistic is $(\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta_0)^2 / \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta})$.
