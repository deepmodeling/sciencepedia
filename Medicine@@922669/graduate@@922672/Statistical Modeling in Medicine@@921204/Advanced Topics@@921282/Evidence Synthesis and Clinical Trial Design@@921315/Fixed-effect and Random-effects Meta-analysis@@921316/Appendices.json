It is a standard exercise in biostatistical methodology. I will now proceed with the derivation and calculation as requested.\n\n### Derivation of Estimators\nLet $X_1$ and $X_0$ be the number of events in the treatment and control arms, respectively, out of totals $n_1$ and $n_0$. The sampling model is that $X_1$ and $X_0$ are independent binomial random variables:\n$$ X_1 \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n_1, p_1) $$\n$$ X_0 \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n_0, p_0) $$\nwhere $p_1$ and $p_0$ are the true event probabilities (risks) in the respective arms. The sample estimates of these risks are $\\hat{p}_1 = a/n_1$ and $\\hat{p}_0 = c/n_0$, where $a$ and $c$ are the observed event counts.\n\nThe Risk Ratio ($RR$) is defined as $p_1 / p_0$. The sample estimate is $\\widehat{RR} = \\hat{p}_1 / \\hat{p}_0$. The desired effect measure is the log-risk ratio, with its sample estimate being:\n$$ y_i = \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\hat{p}_1}{\\hat{p}_0}\\right) = \\ln(\\hat{p}_1) - \\ln(\\hat{p}_0) $$\nSubstituting the sample proportions:\n$$ y_i = \\ln\\left(\\frac{a/n_1}{c/n_0}\\right) $$\n\nTo find the variance of $y_i$, we use the delta method. Let the function be $f(p_1, p_0) = \\ln(p_1) - \\ln(p_0)$. The variance of $y_i = f(\\hat{p}_1, \\hat{p}_0)$ is approximated by:\n$$ \\text{Var}(y_i) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_1}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_1) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_0}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_0) $$\nThis expression omits the covariance term because the two trial arms are independent, meaning $\\text{Cov}(\\hat{p}_1, \\hat{p}_0) = 0$. The partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_1} = \\frac{1}{p_1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p_0} = -\\frac{1}{p_0} $$\nThe variances of the sample proportions are:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_1) = \\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_0) = \\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n_0} $$\nSubstituting these into the delta method formula and evaluating at the true parameters $(p_1, p_0)$:\n$$ \\text{Var}(y_i) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{p_1}\\right)^2 \\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \\left(-\\frac{1}{p_0}\\right)^2 \\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n_0} = \\frac{1-p_1}{n_1 p_1} + \\frac{1-p_0}{n_0 p_0} $$\nAn estimator for this variance, $v_i$, is obtained by substituting the sample estimates $\\hat{p}_1=a/n_1$ and $\\hat{p}_0=c/n_0$ for the true parameters $p_1$ and $p_0$:\n$$ v_i = \\frac{1-\\hat{p}_1}{n_1 \\hat{p}_1} + \\frac{1-\\hat{p}_0}{n_0 \\hat{p}_0} = \\frac{1-a/n_1}{n_1(a/n_1)} + \\frac{1-c/n_0}{n_0(c/n_0)} = \\frac{1-a/n_1}{a} + \\frac{1-c/n_0}{c} $$\nThis simplifies to a commonly used form:\n$$ v_i = \\left(\\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{n_1}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{c} - \\frac{1}{n_0}\\right) $$\nThis expression reveals the problem with zero counts: if $a=0$ or $c=0$, the terms $1/a$ or $1/c$ are undefined.\n\n### Application of Continuity Correction\nThe initial data are:\n- Treatment arm: $a=0$, $b=50$, so $n_1 = a+b = 50$.\n- Control arm: $c=4$, $d=96$, so $n_0 = c+d = 100$.\n\nSince $a=0$, we must apply the specified continuity correction by adding $0.5$ to all four cell counts. Let the corrected counts be $a', b', c', d'$.\n$$ a' = a + 0.5 = 0 + 0.5 = 0.5 $$\n$$ b' = b + 0.5 = 50 + 0.5 = 50.5 $$\n$$ c' = c + 0.5 = 4 + 0.5 = 4.5 $$\n$$ d' = d + 0.5 = 96 + 0.5 = 96.5 $$\nThe corrected group totals are:\n$$ n_1' = a' + b' = 0.5 + 50.5 = 51 $$\n$$ n_0' = c' + d' = 4.5 + 96.5 = 101 $$\n\n### Calculation of $y_i$ and $v_i$\nWe now use these corrected counts in the derived formulas.\nThe log-risk ratio estimator $y_i$ is:\n$$ y_i = \\ln\\left(\\frac{a'/n_1'}{c'/n_0'}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.5 / 51}{4.5 / 101}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.5 \\times 101}{51 \\times 4.5}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{50.5}{229.5}\\right) $$\n$$ y_i \\approx \\ln(0.22004357) \\approx -1.513900 $$\n\nThe variance estimator $v_i$ is:\n$$ v_i = \\frac{1}{a'} - \\frac{1}{n_1'} + \\frac{1}{c'} - \\frac{1}{n_0'} = \\frac{1}{0.5} - \\frac{1}{51} + \\frac{1}{4.5} - \\frac{1}{101} $$\n$$ v_i = 2 - \\frac{1}{51} + \\frac{2}{9} - \\frac{1}{101} $$\nNumerically:\n$$ v_i \\approx 2 - 0.01960784 + 0.22222222 - 0.00990099 \\approx 2.19271339 $$\n\n### Final Answer Rounding\nThe problem requires rounding each component to four significant figures.\n- For $y_i = -1.513900$: The first four significant figures are $1, 5, 1, 3$. The fifth digit is $9$, so we round the last significant digit up.\n$$ y_i \\approx -1.514 $$\n- For $v_i = 2.19271339$: The first four significant figures are $2, 1, 9, 2$.
