It is scientifically grounded in the theory of quantile regression, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the distinction between the true conditional quantile function, $Q_Y(\\tau \\mid x)$, and its empirical estimate, $\\hat Q_Y(\\tau \\mid x)$. The true function $Q_Y(\\tau \\mid x)$ is defined as the inverse of the conditional cumulative distribution function $F_{Y \\mid X=x}(y)$:\n$$ Q_Y(\\tau \\mid x) = \\inf \\left\\{ y : F_{Y \\mid X = x}(y) \\ge \\tau \\right\\} $$\nSince any CDF $F_{Y \\mid X = x}(y)$ is nondecreasing in $y$, it follows as a fundamental property that its inverse, the quantile function $Q_Y(\\tau \\mid x)$, must be nondecreasing in the probability level $\\tau \\in (0,1)$ for any fixed vector of covariates $x$. This means that for $\\tau_1  \\tau_2$, we must have $Q_Y(\\tau_1 \\mid x) \\le Q_Y(\\tau_2 \\mid x)$. In the context of the problem, this implies $Q_Y(0.75 \\mid x) \\le Q_Y(0.90 \\mid x)$.\n\nHowever, when conditional quantiles are estimated from data, for example by separately minimizing the check loss function $\\rho_{\\tau}(u) = u (\\tau - \\mathbf{1}\\{u0\\})$ for different values of $\\tau$, the resulting estimated functions $\\hat Q_Y(\\tau \\mid x)$ are not guaranteed to be monotone in $\\tau$. Sampling variability can lead to \"quantile crossing,\" where for some $x$ and some $\\tau_1  \\tau_2$, the estimates violate the monotonicity property, i.e., $\\hat Q_Y(\\tau_2 \\mid x)  \\hat Q_Y(\\tau_1 \\mid x)$.\n\nThe problem states that such crossing is observed for the specified risk tiers: $\\hat Q_Y(0.90 \\mid x)  \\hat Q_Y(0.75 \\mid x)$. The risk tiers are defined by exceeding these estimated quantile thresholds:\n- Tier 1: $y  \\hat Q_Y(0.75 \\mid x)$\n- Tier 2: $y  \\hat Q_Y(0.90 \\mid x)$\n\nThe intended clinical interpretation is that Tier 2 represents a higher, more severe level of risk than Tier 1. This hierarchical structure requires that any patient who qualifies for Tier 2 must also qualify for Tier 1. We now evaluate each statement in light of this setup.\n\n**Analysis of Option A:**\nThis statement claims that if $\\hat Q_Y(0.90 \\mid x)  \\hat Q_Y(0.75 \\mid x)$, the exceedance sets $S_{\\tau}(x) = \\{ y : y \\ge \\hat Q_Y(\\tau \\mid x) \\}$ are not properly nested, leading to a paradoxical classification, and that enforcing monotonicity rectifies this. Let's examine this.\nThe intended nesting of risk tiers requires that the set of patients in Tier 2 is a subset of the set of patients in Tier 1. This corresponds to the nesting of exceedance sets $S_{0.90}(x) \\subseteq S_{0.75}(x)$, which holds if and only if $\\hat Q_Y(0.90 \\mid x) \\ge \\hat Q_Y(0.75 \\mid x)$.\nThe observed crossing, $\\hat Q_Y(0.90 \\mid x)  \\hat Q_Y(0.75 \\mid x)$, violates this condition. In this scenario, it is possible to find a biomarker value $y$ such that $\\hat Q_Y(0.90 \\mid x)  y  \\hat Q_Y(0.75 \\mid x)$. A patient with such a value $y$ would satisfy $y  \\hat Q_Y(0.90 \\mid x)$ and thus be classified into Tier 2, but would not satisfy $y  \\hat Q_Y(0.75 \\mid x)$ and thus would not be classified into Tier 1.\nThis is a logical contradiction in the risk stratification system: a patient is classified into the higher-risk tier without being in the lower-risk tier. This undermines the interpretability and consistency of the clinical thresholds.\nEnforcing monotonicity through post-estimation adjustments (like rearrangement) produces a new estimator $\\tilde Q_Y(\\tau \\mid x)$ that is, by construction, nondecreasing in $\\tau$. This ensures $\\tilde Q_Y(0.75 \\mid x) \\le \\tilde Q_Y(0.90 \\mid x)$, which restores the proper nesting of the corresponding risk strata. Thus, the statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThis statement dismisses the problem as \"clinically benign\" and suggests using conditional means instead of quantiles. As established in the analysis of Option A, quantile crossing is not benign; it creates logically inconsistent risk tiers that can lead to flawed clinical decisions. The primary motivation for using quantile regression is often to model aspects of the conditional distribution that the mean cannot capture, such as effects on the tails of the distribution or heteroscedasticity. To suggest abandoning the chosen, more informative method because of a solvable estimation artifact is not a sound argument. The claim that adjustments are \"unnecessary\" is false, and the claim they \"can harm calibration\" is misleading; the structurally inconsistent unadjusted estimates are themselves problematic, and adjustments are designed to improve the overall validity of the quantile function estimate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis statement provides a formal justification for monotonicity adjustments. It correctly states the premises: the true CQF $Q_Y(\\tau \\mid x)$ is nondecreasing in $\\tau$, and rearrangement of the estimate $\\hat Q_Y(\\tau \\mid x)$ yields a monotone estimator $\\tilde Q_Y(\\tau \\mid x)$ which restores nested thresholds. The crucial part of the statement is the reference to a theoretical result concerning the integrated $L_p$ error. This is a well-established theorem in statistical theory regarding isotonic regression and rearrangement of estimators. It states that if the true function $f$ (here, $Q_Y(\\tau \\mid x)$ as a function of $\\tau$) is monotone, then for any estimator $\\hat{f}$, its monotone rearrangement $\\tilde{f}$ is closer to $f$ in any $L_p$ norm for $p \\ge 1$. That is, $\\int_0^1 |\\tilde Q_Y(\\tau \\mid x) - Q_Y(\\tau \\mid x) |^p d\\tau \\le \\int_0^1 |\\hat Q_Y(\\tau \\mid x) - Q_Y(\\tau \\mid x) |^p d\\tau$. This means the adjustment not only fixes the ordering but also improves the estimator's overall accuracy by bringing it closer to the true (unknown) quantile function. This provides a strong, principled basis for using such adjustments. The statement is a correct summary of the statistical theory and its application.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis statement claims crossing affects only \"interpretability but not decisions,\" which is false, as the classification into tiers is a decision. It then makes the unsubstantiated and contextually irrelevant claim that \"clinical classification is governed by odds ratios and logistic models,\" ignoring the problem's premise that a quantile regression model is being used. Finally, it proposes a non-sequitur: adjusting for monotonicity in covariates $x$ instead of in the probability level $\\tau$. The problem of quantile crossing is about the function's behavior with respect to $\\tau$ for a fixed $x$. Monotonicity in $x$ is a different concept and adjusting for it does not solve the crossing problem in $\\tau$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option E:**\nThis statement incorrectly identifies the cause of quantile crossing. Crossing is an artifact of estimation (sampling error), not a necessary consequence of heteroscedasticity. True conditional quantile functions for heteroscedastic models are still perfectly monotone in $\\tau$. Therefore, attributing crossing to \"inappropriate covariates\" in the presence of heteroscedasticity is a misdiagnosis. The proposed solution to remove covariates is drastic and misguided. The statement's final claim that \"monotonicity adjustments across $\\tau$ cannot mitigate decision instability\" is directly contradicted by the analysis in options A and C, which shows these adjustments are precisely the tool for resolving this instability.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, statements A and C are correct. They accurately describe the practical consequences of quantile crossing and the theoretical justification for correcting it.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "4981872"}]}
