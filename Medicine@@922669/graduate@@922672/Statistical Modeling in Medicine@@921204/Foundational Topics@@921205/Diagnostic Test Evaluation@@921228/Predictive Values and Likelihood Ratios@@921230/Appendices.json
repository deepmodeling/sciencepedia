In clinical practice, the crucial question is often, 'Given a positive result, what is the probability the patient has the disease?'

Starting only from the core definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and the law of total probability, derive the probability that an individual has the disease given a positive test result and express it as the positive predictive value (PPV).

Round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem is found to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of biostatistics and epidemiology, is mathematically well-posed and self-contained, and uses objective, unambiguous language.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n$D$: The event that an individual has the disease.\n$D^c$: The event that an individual does not have the disease.\n$T^+$: The event that the test result is positive.\n$T^-$: The event that the test result is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following probabilities, based on the definitions of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity:\nThe prevalence of the disease is $p = P(D) = 0.001$.\nThe probability of not having the disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.001 = 0.999$.\nThe sensitivity of the test is $Se = P(T^+|D) = 0.99$. This is the probability of a positive test given the individual has the disease.\nThe specificity of the test is $Sp = P(T^-|D^c) = 0.99$. This is the probability of a negative test given the individual does not have the disease.\n\nFrom the definition of specificity, we can determine the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given the individual does not have the disease:\n$$P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$$\n\nThe primary goal is to derive the positive predictive value (PPV), which is the probability that an individual has the disease given a positive test result, denoted by $P(D|T^+)$. We start from the definition of conditional probability, which is a formulation of Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T^+)$, is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive. It can be expressed using the definition of sensitivity:\n$$P(T^+|D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(D)} \\implies P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+|D) \\cdot P(D) = Se \\cdot p$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of receiving a positive test result. We can find this using the law of total probability, by summing the probabilities of a positive test over the partition of the population into those with the disease ($D$) and those without ($D^c$):\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the known terms:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se \\cdot p) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - p))$$\nNow, we can assemble the complete expression for the PPV:\n$$PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}$$\nThis expression is derived solely from the provided definitions and the law of total probability.\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values: $Se=0.99$, $Sp=0.99$, and $p=0.001$.\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.99 \\times 0.001}{0.99 \\times 0.001 + (1 - 0.99) \\times (1 - 0.001)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.00099}{0.00099 + (0.01) \\times (0.999)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.00099}{0.00099 + 0.00999}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.00099}{0.01098} \\approx 0.09016393...$$\n\nTo interpret this result in a public health context, we consider screening a population of $N=10^6$ individuals.\nThe expected number of individuals with the disease is:\n$$E[\\text{Diseased}] = N \\times p = 10^6 \\times 0.001 = 1000$$\nThe expected number of individuals without the disease is:\n$$E[\\text{Not Diseased}] = N \\times (1 - p) = 10^6 \\times 0.999 = 999000$$\nThe expected number of true positives (TP), i.e., diseased individuals who test positive, is:\n$$E[TP] = E[\\text{Diseased}] \\times Se = 1000 \\times 0.99 = 990$$\nThe expected number of false positives (FP), i.e., disease-free individuals who test positive, is:\n$$E[FP] = E[\\text{Not Diseased}] \\times (1 - Sp) = 999000 \\times 0.01 = 9990$$\nThe total expected number of positive tests is the sum of true positives and false positives:\n$$E[\\text{Total Positives}] = E[TP] + E[FP] = 990 + 9990 = 10980$$\nThe PPV can be independently confirmed as the ratio of true positives to total positives:\n$$PPV = \\frac{E[TP]}{E[\\text{Total Positives}]} = \\frac{990}{10980} \\approx 0.09016$$\nThis confirms our calculation. The interpretation is now clear: despite the test's high accuracy ($99\\%$ sensitivity and $99\\%$ specificity), the number of false positives ($9990$) is more than ten times greater than the number of true positives ($990$). This occurs because the disease is very rare ($p=0.001$), so the small false positive rate ($1\\%$) is applied to an extremely large population of healthy individuals, generating a large absolute number of false alarms. In contrast, the high sensitivity is applied to a very small population of diseased individuals. Consequently, for any single individual who receives a positive test result, the probability that they actually have the disease is only about $9\\%$.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of the PPV rounded to four significant figures.\n$PPV \\approx 0.09016$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.09016}$$", "id": "4557306"}, {"introduction": "While predictive values are intuitive, they must be recalculated for every different patient population or prevalence.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is the probability that a subject with a positive test result truly has the disease, $P(D \\mid T^{+})$. Using Bayes' theorem, we can express PPV in terms of sensitivity ($\\text{se}$), specificity ($\\text{sp}$), and prevalence ($p$):\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^{+})} $$\nBy the law of total probability, the denominator is $P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\mid D)P(D) + P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D)P(\\neg D)$.\nWe are given $\\text{se} = P(T^{+} \\mid D)$ and $\\text{sp} = P(T^{-} \\mid \\neg D)$, from which it follows that $P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - P(T^{-} \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - \\text{sp}$. Using the prevalence $p = P(D)$ and $P(\\neg D) = 1-p$, the formula for PPV becomes:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{\\text{se} \\cdot p}{\\text{se} \\cdot p + (1-\\text{sp})(1-p)} $$\n\n**Part 1: Stratum-Specific PPVs and the Role of LR$^{+}$**\n\nFirst, we compute the Positive Likelihood Ratio ($\\text{LR}^{+}$) for each test. The definition is $\\text{LR}^{+} = \\frac{P(T^{+}\\mid D)}{P(T^{+}\\mid \\neg D)} = \\frac{\\text{se}}{1-\\text{sp}}$.\nFor Test $A$:\n$$ \\text{LR}^{+}_{A} = \\frac{\\text{se}_{A}}{1-\\text{sp}_{A}} = \\frac{0.95}{1 - 0.98} = \\frac{0.95}{0.02} = 47.5 $$\nFor Test $B$:\n$$ \\text{LR}^{+}_{B} = \\frac{\\text{se}_{B}}{1-\\text{sp}_{B}} = \\frac{0.90}{1 - 0.95} = \\frac{0.90}{0.05} = 18 $$\nThe role of the $\\text{LR}^{+}$ is to quantify how much a positive test result increases the odds of having the disease. The relationship is given by: Post-test odds = Pre-test odds $\\times \\text{LR}^{+}$. Since the pre-test odds ($\\frac{p}{1-p}$) are fixed within any given stratum, the test with the higher $\\text{LR}^{+}$ will always yield a higher post-test odds, and consequently a higher PPV. As $\\text{LR}^{+}_{A}  \\text{LR}^{+}_{B}$, Test $A$ is the superior test in its ability to confirm the presence of disease and will have a higher PPV than Test $B$ in any stratum, assuming invariant test characteristics.\n\nNow, we compute the stratum-specific PPVs.\n\nFor Stratum $L$ (prevalence $p_{L} = 0.02$):\n$$ \\text{PPV}_{A,L} = \\frac{0.95 \\cdot 0.02}{0.95 \\cdot 0.02 + (1-0.98)(1-0.02)} = \\frac{0.019}{0.019 + (0.02)(0.98)} = \\frac{0.019}{0.019 + 0.0196} = \\frac{0.019}{0.0386} \\approx 0.4922 $$\n$$ \\text{PPV}_{B,L} = \\frac{0.90 \\cdot 0.02}{0.90 \\cdot 0.02 + (1-0.95)(1-0.02)} = \\frac{0.018}{0.018 + (0.05)(0.98)} = \\frac{0.018}{0.018 + 0.049} = \\frac{0.018}{0.067} \\approx 0.2687 $$\nAs predicted, $\\text{PPV}_{A,L}  \\text{PPV}_{B,L}$.\n\nFor Stratum $H$ (prevalence $p_{H} = 0.20$):\n$$ \\text{PPV}_{A,H} = \\frac{0.95 \\cdot 0.20}{0.95 \\cdot 0.20 + (1-0.98)(1-0.20)} = \\frac{0.19}{0.19 + (0.02)(0.80)} = \\frac{0.19}{0.19 + 0.016} = \\frac{0.19}{0.206} \\approx 0.9223 $$\n$$ \\text{PPV}_{B,H} = \\frac{0.90 \\cdot 0.20}{0.90 \\cdot 0.20 + (1-0.95)(1-0.20)} = \\frac{0.18}{0.18 + (0.05)(0.80)} = \\frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.04} = \\frac{0.18}{0.22} \\approx 0.8182 $$\nAgain, as predicted, $\\text{PPV}_{A,H}  \\text{PPV}_{B,H}$.\n\n**Part 2: Overall Positive Predictive Values**\n\nThe overall PPV is the ratio of the total expected number of true positives to the total expected number of positive test results.\nTotal TPs = $\\sum_{s} N_{s} \\cdot p_{s} \\cdot \\text{se}$\nTotal FPs = $\\sum_{s} N_{s} \\cdot (1-p_{s}) \\cdot (1-\\text{sp})$\nOverall PPV = $\\frac{\\text{Total TPs}}{\\text{Total TPs} + \\text{Total FPs}}$\n\nFor Test $A$, which was administered to $N_{A,L}=9000$ people in stratum $L$ and $N_{A,H}=1000$ in stratum $H$:\nTotal True Positives for Test $A$:\n$$ \\text{TP}_{A,\\text{overall}} = (N_{A,L} \\cdot p_{L} \\cdot \\text{se}_{A}) + (N_{A,H} \\cdot p_{H} \\cdot \\text{se}_{A}) = (9000 \\cdot 0.02 \\cdot 0.95) + (1000 \\cdot 0.20 \\cdot 0.95) $$\n$$ \\text{TP}_{A,\\text{overall}} = 171 + 190 = 361 $$\nTotal False Positives for Test $A$:\n$$ \\text{FP}_{A,\\text{overall}} = (N_{A,L} \\cdot (1-p_{L}) \\cdot (1-\\text{sp}_{A})) + (N_{A,H} \\cdot (1-p_{H}) \\cdot (1-\\text{sp}_{A})) $$\n$$ \\text{FP}_{A,\\text{overall}} = (9000 \\cdot 0.98 \\cdot 0.02) + (1000 \\cdot 0.80 \\cdot 0.02) = 176.4 + 16 = 192.4 $$\nOverall PPV for Test $A$:\n$$ \\text{PPV}_{A,\\text{overall}} = \\frac{\\text{TP}_{A,\\text{overall}}}{\\text{TP}_{A,\\text{overall}} + \\text{FP}_{A,\\text{overall}}} = \\frac{361}{361 + 192.4} = \\frac{361}{553.4} \\approx 0.65231297 $$\n\nFor Test $B$, which was administered to $N_{B,L}=1000$ people in stratum $L$ and $N_{B,H}=9000$ in stratum $H$:\nTotal True Positives for Test $B$:\n$$ \\text{TP}_{B,\\text{overall}} = (N_{B,L} \\cdot p_{L} \\cdot \\text{se}_{B}) + (N_{B,H} \\cdot p_{H} \\cdot \\text{se}_{B}) = (1000 \\cdot 0.02 \\cdot 0.90) + (9000 \\cdot 0.20 \\cdot 0.90) $$\n$$ \\text{TP}_{B,\\text{overall}} = 18 + 1620 = 1638 $$\nTotal False Positives for Test $B$:\n$$ \\text{FP}_{B,\\text{overall}} = (N_{B,L} \\cdot (1-p_{L}) \\cdot (1-\\text{sp}_{B})) + (N_{B,H} \\cdot (1-p_{H}) \\cdot (1-\\text{sp}_{B})) $$\n$$ \\text{FP}_{B,\\text{overall}} = (1000 \\cdot 0.98 \\cdot 0.05) + (9000 \\cdot 0.80 \\cdot 0.05) = 49 + 360 = 409 $$\nOverall PPV for Test $B$:\n$$ \\text{PPV}_{B,\\text{overall}} = \\frac{\\text{TP}_{B,\\text{overall}}}{\\text{TP}_{B,\\text{overall}} + \\text{FP}_{B,\\text{overall}}} = \\frac{1638}{1638 + 409} = \\frac{1638}{2047} \\approx 0.80019541 $$\n\n**Part 3: Compute the Difference**\n\nThe numerical difference $D$ is calculated as:\n$$ D = \\text{PPV}_{B,\\text{overall}} - \\text{PPV}_{A,\\text{overall}} $$\n$$ D \\approx 0.80019541 - 0.65231297 = 0.14788244 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $D \\approx 0.1479$.
