It describes a standard epidemiological calculation for an incidence rate and its confidence interval from cohort study data. The use of person-time and the Poisson model are standard practice for this scenario. All necessary data are provided, and there are no contradictions. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of a point estimate and a $95\\%$ exact confidence interval for an incidence rate.\n\n#### Part 1: Point Estimate of the Incidence Rate\n\nThe incidence rate, denoted by $\\lambda$, is defined as the number of new events per unit of person-time at risk. The point estimate, $\\hat{\\lambda}$, is calculated as the total number of observed events, $d$, divided by the total person-time at risk, $PT$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total person-time at risk by summing the follow-up times for all participants:\n$$\nPT = 1.2 \\text{ years} + 0.8 \\text{ years} + 2.0 \\text{ years} + 0.5 \\text{ years}\n$$\n$$\nPT = 4.5 \\text{ person-years}\n$$\n\nThe number of observed events is given as $d = 3$.\n\nThe point estimate of the incidence rate is then:\n$$\n\\hat{\\lambda} = \\frac{d}{PT} = \\frac{3}{4.5} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ events per person-year}\n$$\nConverting this to a decimal, we get:\n$$\n\\hat{\\lambda} \\approx 0.666666... \\text{ events per person-year}\n$$\n\n#### Part 2: 95% Exact Confidence Interval for the Incidence Rate\n\nThe problem specifies that the number of events follows a Poisson distribution. The total number of events, $d=3$, is a single observation from a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu$. The mean $\\mu$ is related to the incidence rate $\\lambda$ and the total person-time $PT$ by the equation $\\mu = \\lambda \\times PT$.\n\nTo find the confidence interval for the rate $\\lambda$, we first compute the confidence interval for the mean count $\\mu$, and then divide its limits by $PT$.\n\nThe exact confidence interval for a Poisson mean $\\mu$, given an observed count $d$, is based on the relationship between the Poisson and chi-squared ($\\chi^2$) distributions. For a $(1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%$ confidence interval, the lower limit $\\mu_L$ and upper limit $\\mu_U$ for the mean $\\mu$ are given by:\n$$\n\\mu_L = \\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{\\alpha/2, 2d}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_U = \\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{1-\\alpha/2, 2(d+1)}\n$$\nwhere $\\chi^2_{p, \\nu}$ is the quantile of the chi-squared distribution with $\\nu$ degrees of freedom that has a cumulative probability of $p$.\n\nFor a $95\\%$ confidence interval, $1-\\alpha = 0.95$, so $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$.\nThe observed number of events is $d=3$.\n\nThe degrees of freedom for the lower limit are $2d = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\nThe degrees of freedom for the upper limit are $2(d+1) = 2 \\times (3+1) = 8$.\n\nWe need the following chi-squared quantiles:\n- For the lower limit: $\\chi^2_{\\alpha/2, 2d} = \\chi^2_{0.025, 6}$\n- For the upper limit: $\\chi^2_{1-\\alpha/2, 2(d+1)} = \\chi^2_{0.975, 8}$\n\nUsing statistical tables or software, we find these values:\n$$\n\\chi^2_{0.025, 6} \\approx 1.237344\n$$\n$$\n\\chi^2_{0.975, 8} \\approx 17.534546\n$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence limits for the mean count $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu_L = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1.237344 = 0.618672\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_U = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 17.534546 = 8.767273\n$$\nThese are the lower and upper limits for the expected number of events over $4.5$ person-years.\n\nTo find the confidence interval for the incidence rate $\\lambda$, we divide these limits by the total person-time, $PT = 4.5$ person-years.\n$$\n\\lambda_L = \\frac{\\mu_L}{PT} = \\frac{0.618672}{4.5} \\approx 0.1374827 \\text{ events per person-year}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_U = \\frac{\\mu_U}{PT} = \\frac{8.767273}{4.5} \\approx 1.9482829 \\text{ events per person-year}\n$$\n\n#### Part 3: Final Results and Rounding\n\nThe problem requires rounding the point estimate, the lower limit, and the upper limit to four significant figures.\n\n- Point Estimate: $\\hat{\\lambda} \\approx 0.666666... \\to 0.6667$\n- Lower Confidence Limit: $\\lambda_L \\approx 0.1374827... \\to 0.1375$\n- Upper Confidence Limit: $\\lambda_U \\approx 1.9482829... \\to 1.948$\n\nThe final result is the ordered triplet $(\\hat{\\lambda}, \\lambda_L, \\lambda_U)$.\nThe three values are $(0.6667, 0.1375, 1.948)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.6667  0.1375  1.948\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "4547023"}, {"introduction": "Incidence and prevalence are the two primary measures of disease frequency, but they are not independent.

Express the final numerical prevalence as a unitless decimal fraction and round your answer to four significant figures.

It represents a classic steady-state compartmental model, for which a unique and meaningful solution exists.\n\nLet $N$ be the total size of the closed, stable population. The population is divided into two mutually exclusive states: cases, with a population size of $C$, and non-cases, with a population size of $S$. Therefore, at all times, we have the relation:\n$$S + C = N$$\nThe point prevalence, designated as $P$, is defined as the proportion of the population that are cases at a given point in time. Under the assumption of steady-state conditions, the prevalence is constant and is given by:\n$$P = \\frac{C}{N}$$\nThe problem provides the incidence rate (also known as incidence density), $\\lambda$, which is the rate at which non-cases become new cases. The value is given as $\\lambda = 0.02$ per person-year. The total rate of inflow into the case state is the product of this per-capita rate and the number of individuals at risk (the non-cases, $S$):\n$$ \\text{Inflow rate} = \\lambda S $$\nThe problem also provides the mean sojourn time in the case state, or the mean duration of the disease, $D = 5$ years. The rate of exit from the case state, which we will denote as $\\gamma$, is the reciprocal of the mean duration:\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{1}{D} $$\nThe total rate of outflow from the case state is the product of this per-capita exit rate and the number of individuals who are cases, $C$:\n$$ \\text{Outflow rate} = \\gamma C = \\frac{1}{D} C $$\nThe core assumption of the problem is that the system is in a steady state, which implies that the inflow to the case state is exactly balanced by the outflow from it:\n$$ \\text{Inflow rate} = \\text{Outflow rate} $$\n$$ \\lambda S = \\frac{C}{D} $$\nTo derive an expression for the prevalence $P$, we must relate the variables in this equation back to $N$. We can express the number of non-cases, $S$, as $S = N - C$. Substituting this into the steady-state equation yields:\n$$ \\lambda (N - C) = \\frac{C}{D} $$\nThe objective is to find $P = C/N$.

In this scenario, $D$ represents the average duration of a single episode of the disease before recovery.\nIf the exit process is death due to the disease, individuals who leave the case state are permanently removed from the population. In this scenario, $D$ represents the average survival time after becoming a case. It is a measure of the disease's lethality.

All necessary data for the calculation of a directly standardized incidence rate are provided.\n\nThe primary objective is to compute the directly standardized incidence rate for Harbor City. This process removes the confounding effect of age structure, allowing for a more equitable comparison of rates between populations with different age distributions. The method involves applying the age-specific incidence rates from the study population (Harbor City) to the age structure of a reference or standard population.\n\nLet the age strata be indexed by $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, corresponding to the age groups $0$–$19$, $20$–$49$, $50$–$79$, and $\\geq 80$ years, respectively.\n\nFirst, we calculate the age-specific incidence rates ($ASIR_i$) for Harbor City.

The incidence rates are substantially higher in the older age groups ($ASIR_3$ and $ASIR_4$ are much larger than $ASIR_1$ and $ASIR_2$). The standard population has a slightly older age structure than Harbor City (e.g., the proportion of person-time for ages $50+$ is ($25,000+5,000)/100,000 = 30\\%$ in the standard population, versus ($90,000+15,000)/405,000 \\approx 25.9\\%$ in Harbor City). By applying Harbor City's high age-specific rates to the older structure of the standard population, we obtain a higher overall rate.
