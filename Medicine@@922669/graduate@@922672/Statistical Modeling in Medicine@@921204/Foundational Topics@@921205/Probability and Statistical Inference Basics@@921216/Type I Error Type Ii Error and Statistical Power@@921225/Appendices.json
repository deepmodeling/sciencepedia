It means that if this less optimistic but plausible scenario were true, the trial would have only a $50/50$ chance of detecting a true therapeutic effect. From a scientific and ethical standpoint, conducting a trial with such a high risk of being inconclusive is unacceptable. It represents a waste of resources and, more importantly, exposes human subjects to the risks of an investigational drug without a reasonable probability of generating useful scientific knowledge.\n\nA robust trial design is one that maintains adequate power (e.g., $\\ge 80\\%$) across a range of plausible scenarios, not just for a single optimistic best-guess. This analysis demonstrates that the current design with $n=100$ per arm is not robust. The primary implication for the trial designers is that a larger sample size is required to buffer the study against the uncertainty in the true effect size and variability. The design must be re-calibrated to ensure sufficient power under this identified worst-case scenario, thereby increasing the overall probability of a successful and informative trial.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5017}\n$$", "id": "4992685"}]}
